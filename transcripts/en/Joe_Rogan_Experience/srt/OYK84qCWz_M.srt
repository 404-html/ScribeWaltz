1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,590
Okay.
Well,

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,600
good experience Joe Rogan podcast by
night all day.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,910
We are now live.
Jeff Ross is the first time we've ever

4
00:00:16,911 --> 00:00:19,190
done a live podcast from the comedy
store.

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,130
And it's with you buddy.
I feel like we're in Hitler's bunker,

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,600
which was,
I think Hillary was Boehner's.

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,430
It probably not as well lit.
Definitely didn't have the sound

8
00:00:28,431 --> 00:00:30,350
dampening.
That's how you know it's a real podcast

9
00:00:30,351 --> 00:00:31,820
studio.
They have this shit.

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,430
The sound dampening sound dampening
stuff.

11
00:00:34,431 --> 00:00:35,510
Do you see it?
It's cool though.

12
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:37,680
It's in the color.
The color of the comedy store.

13
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:39,920
Again,
the old old comedy store sign in the

14
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:42,560
background and uh,
we figured fuck it.

15
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,740
We're here all the time.
Usually I'm just here hanging around

16
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,360
after.
Why not do a podcast?

17
00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:49,310
Have some fun.
I love it.

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,330
Hi everybody.
Happy Thursday.

19
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,390
Happy Thursday.
So this is how many about you fucking

20
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:59,900
show tell you're,
you're a roast battle is on comedy

21
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:00,590
central.

22
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,730
It's crazy,
man.

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,710
It's amazing.
Started out in the belly room.

24
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:05,660
You know,
you came in great.

25
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:07,610
It's one of the reasons why I came back
to the store.

26
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,140
When I came to see that show in the
belly room.

27
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,180
I was like,
wow.

28
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,490
It was the day before Ari film this
special.

29
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,410
And uh,
I hadn't been to the store in seven

30
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:19,730
years and I remember I came here for you
at the Improv that night.

31
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,990
Yeah,
I'd seen you a couple,

32
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:23,900
a tip and Finney at the Improv Aranow I
kept talking about it.

33
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,720
That's where I was doing sets.
I kind of made it a personal mission to

34
00:01:26,721 --> 00:01:29,540
bring you back to the comedy store.
Oh,

35
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:32,210
sweetie.
And roast battle was the bait.

36
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,760
Well,
he roast battle definitely helped to

37
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,190
also because it was so electric.
I was like,

38
00:01:37,191 --> 00:01:38,900
man,
there's something going on in this

39
00:01:38,901 --> 00:01:41,150
place.
I love doing the show so much.

40
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,360
And the comics love doing it.
It's the only competition show where

41
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,870
comics who aren't even on the show come
to watch other comics.

42
00:01:47,871 --> 00:01:49,190
Yeah,
it's insane.

43
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,530
It's one of the rare shows were comics
come to watch.

44
00:01:51,531 --> 00:01:55,230
Other comics were shooting in the old
house of blues across the street.

45
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:59,060
They're knocking it down and a couple of
weeks of building condos forever.

46
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,520
Very historic building.
It's kind of crazy.

47
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:04,580
So our producer Joel and had the idea to
go in there,

48
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,380
pull the stage,
I'll clean it up.

49
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,840
There was like all kinds of stuff living
in there.

50
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:14,000
And we built our roast battle arena
inside the old house of Blues for four

51
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,550
nights.
I can't believe this is happening.

52
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,410
That's crazy.
It's like,

53
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:22,070
you know the early days of wrestling or
fighting or something.

54
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,320
I can't believe it.
Turn it into condos.

55
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,100
That stuff's hard to realize that that's
what we're going to have across the

56
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:28,430
street.

57
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,880
But maybe it will be good in some way.
Well I bet a lot of comics who are just

58
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:34,070
going to get a fucking apartment there.
If you can afford it,

59
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,210
that'd be amazing.
Stumble out of bar across the street

60
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:40,400
about that.
Why not live there?

61
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:42,800
I mean,
come on man.

62
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:44,900
It'd be the greatest.
And if you have a reluctant girl,

63
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,880
you know,
you're uh,

64
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,730
trying to meet a young lady and you're
like,

65
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,780
come on back to my place.
Wow.

66
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,250
I mean,
I'm getting kinda tired.

67
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,080
Listen baby,
it's just across the street.

68
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,630
Yeah,
come on over.

69
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,240
I mean we don't,
we have,

70
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,200
I mean you are kind of funny and I just
want you to know I'm not that kind of

71
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:04,390
girl.
Well because we'll play,

72
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:08,380
we'll play ping pong in my a rec room.
Paint.

73
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,900
Ping Pong is a good one to play.
Everyone thinks he know how to play

74
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:12,850
foosball,
right?

75
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,380
I'm not,
I don't know.

76
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:15,430
Do they?
Yeah.

77
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:18,410
A lot of drunk people think they know
how to play the whole foods thing.

78
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,100
Nobody knows how to play ping pong like
a few people do,

79
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:22,120
but those are,
they're assholes.

80
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,560
I have two Chinese cousins and they're
very good at China and ping pong go

81
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:28,690
together for some reason.
Is that video,

82
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:31,570
has anyone seen that video of Bruce Lee
hitting done chucks?

83
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,490
Is that a real,
real damn.

84
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,320
Why did you think it was real?
It looks so fucking fake.

85
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,940
I could eat glass.
Imagine if he was a world champion Ping

86
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:47,780
Pong player plus this martial arts
master and even take it.

87
00:03:47,781 --> 00:03:50,660
In fact it is ping pong was that good?
That was more like he was hitting the

88
00:03:50,661 --> 00:03:53,240
ball without,
what's he doing it with nunchucks?

89
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:53,720
Yeah.

90
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,450
Yeah,
sure.

91
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,770
I can't,
I don't even know why I answered that.

92
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,060
I should have told you.
Yes

93
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,000
Bro.
Boosie was a master.

94
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,510
Never wanted to know what I shouldn't
have asked

95
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,760
night or Eddie Griffin was telling a
Bruce Lee story and Eddie griff was just

96
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:12,070
drunk as fuck and he was making up some
Bruce Lee store.

97
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,220
He's like,
it was 39 people in the room when he

98
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,590
died.
All of them attack Bruce Lee,

99
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,680
18 of them died before

100
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:20,530
God.
I'm like,

101
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,400
wow.
I was like,

102
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:22,810
what?
No,

103
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:23,141
no,
no,

104
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:23,531
no,
no.

105
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:24,364
He,
he,

106
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,890
he had like an allergic reaction to a
drug or something.

107
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,750
They're like a blood clot or something.
I don't know.

108
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,320
Something you think some people think
that Chinese triad had?

109
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,860
I'm whacked.
Oh really?

110
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,180
Yeah.

111
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,710
Cause you know his son Brandon died on
the set of a movie where they had a fake

112
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,980
gun,
like a gun with a blank and they shot at

113
00:04:43,981 --> 00:04:47,970
him and there was something inside the
gun and it wound up killing him.

114
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,620
Yeah.
What a way to go.

115
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:52,510
Was it a stunt man who shot him or
another way?

116
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,680
I think it was another actor and they
from then on,

117
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,560
they now they made a new rule after
that.

118
00:04:58,561 --> 00:05:02,880
I think this might be bullshit,
but I think the new rule was what I had

119
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:05,940
heard was that you can't point a gun at
someone when you shoot them.

120
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,680
Like instead of shooting you with a
blank,

121
00:05:07,681 --> 00:05:09,990
if you and I were in a movie and I was
going to shoot you the blank,

122
00:05:09,991 --> 00:05:13,260
I'd have to do that.
Or it looks like from over there that

123
00:05:13,261 --> 00:05:15,090
I'm shooting at you,
but I'm really shooting to the left of

124
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:15,910
it.

125
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,140
Fascinating.
Wow.

126
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,140
I guess I never realized that syteline
is weird.

127
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,130
Yeah.
You remember his brother,

128
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:23,980
the chro or the sun rather than the
movie the crow.

129
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,770
It was cool and they did after they had
a finish it without them or something.

130
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:28,660
Yeah.
They had to like hire some guy to

131
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:33,310
pretend to be him.
I think it's 2017 we're almost done with

132
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,010
January.
It not one major celebrity has died in

133
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:36,670
any way.
Yeah.

134
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,200
Crazy.
How amazing.

135
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:40,030
How many dropped off right before the
end though.

136
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,240
Carrie Fisher was a bummer.
That was crazy.

137
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,910
Who else died?
Prince.

138
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,210
Prince George.
Michael.

139
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,300
David Bowie.
Prince is a bad one,

140
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:51,370
man.
He died from fucking pain pills.

141
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,680
It would go to,
we lost fish a year ago.

142
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:57,980
Really?
Beginning of

143
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,360
last year.
Oh Shit.

144
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,970
Tough one.
I don't have about 75 years old.

145
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,530
He was at least that old.
What was it about Barney is sag number

146
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:08,120
was three.
Barney Miller,

147
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:10,120
right?
Was that a those onto a plate shot?

148
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,980
Barney Miller and then he had fish.
She was on his own show.

149
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:14,900
He was in the godfather movies.
That true.

150
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,400
He had to spin off though,
right?

151
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,750
If fish.
Yeah.

152
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:18,560
That was this.
That was also,

153
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,900
that shows only on one season.
But everyone remembers it

154
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,650
for one season.
Never heard of it.

155
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,080
You didn't remember.
Fish lasted one season and everyone

156
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:30,914
remembers it.

157
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,600
This.
Now that you know,

158
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,810
you know you've been on tv a bunch of
times and you know you've had your own

159
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:39,950
show and now you've got rose paddle on.
Do you think there's so many shows on

160
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:43,400
now with so many networks and so many
channels and then the streaming shit

161
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:48,290
like Netflix and Hulu and you know CSO
and a million and it's almost like

162
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,310
there's too much content.

163
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,330
I think it's just for some reason more
narrowed.

164
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,260
You know you get your exact audience.
That's true.

165
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,660
Strange.
You know like Doug Benson had something

166
00:07:00,661 --> 00:07:04,190
for pot smokers and someone else has
something for home improvement and then

167
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,200
there's a 30 a channel just for cooking
shows and it's kind of like that I guess

168
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,580
a otherwise it's hard to understand.

169
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,450
Well it's,
it's hard to get people to know about

170
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:16,320
your show just from TV.
Right?

171
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,900
You need like some sort of a web
presence and some sort of a social media

172
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:23,510
presence and something else.
It's like regular shows.

173
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:26,060
Like if you just put it on after a
successful show,

174
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,220
nobody knows what the fuck it is.
They just change the channel to

175
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:29,090
something they do know.

176
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,100
Right.
Interesting.

177
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,600
There's almost too many things going on
now,

178
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:32,950
Jeff.
That's what's hard about it.

179
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,630
It's launching any TV show and roared
doing our show is a tournament like as

180
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:40,450
an event.
So by the time you even know it's on,

181
00:07:40,451 --> 00:07:41,120
it's over.

182
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,130
Yeah,
but it's so good.

183
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,080
It's so good.
It can't lose.

184
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,980
That's,
that's a show.

185
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:49,070
When when they said that they were going
to turn that into a television show,

186
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:50,480
my,
that campus,

187
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,100
it can't miss.
And I,

188
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,650
you know,
especially if you could figure out a way

189
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:58,340
to do them all in the belly room.
I really feel like the belly room is

190
00:07:58,341 --> 00:07:59,870
something special.
It really is.

191
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:02,510
The magic is something.
It's so intimate.

192
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:05,120
It's so,
and when you see someone get fucking

193
00:08:05,121 --> 00:08:08,330
crushed in the belly room,
like I've heard some goddamn titanic

194
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:11,420
lines up there.
What did Kim Kong did say about this

195
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:13,640
girl?
She said,

196
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,070
oh,
she said she's not union but her tits or

197
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:16,904
sad.

198
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,620
It really is a joke.
Writers showcase.

199
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,340
It is.
Well you want it to last next weekend.

200
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:27,140
I don't know when you were posting were
alive.

201
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,220
So it's,
yeah,

202
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:29,450
we're live now.
We're live now.

203
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:30,284
Hi,
I forgot.

204
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,610
So when is it a 26 27 28 and 29 January,
four nights in a row and it has it

205
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:40,070
already.
It's a bracketed tournament.

206
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:44,360
We're started taping tomorrow and then
the finale is live on the 29th that's

207
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:45,680
awesome.
Live on TV.

208
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:48,710
It's fun right now because right around
we're in the comedy store right now.

209
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,620
All the New York comics are staying
across the street,

210
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,290
so they're all coming over to check out
the comedy store and now we're shooting

211
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,040
across the street,

212
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,950
the old house of Blues.
So like this whole little neighborhood

213
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:01,710
is going to be roast battle neighborhood
for a week or so.

214
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,500
You hear the piano?
It's kind of great.

215
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,570
We're downstairs below the original
rooms

216
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,040
underground.
That's what we're going to call it

217
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,800
underground at the comedy store.
Right.

218
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,630
Perfect.
Because we're underground.

219
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,070
That's what we'll call it.
You got it.

220
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,560
Love that.
Live underground from the comedy store.

221
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,420
Fuck yeah.
Cause you can hear,

222
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,870
he can hear comics killing up there and
you can hear the piano music.

223
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,810
It's fucking oss.
Got a real feel to it bro.

224
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,370
Dude,
you shaved your eyebrows.

225
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:33,630
I ran into you in New York five months
ago and you had shaved your eyebrows.

226
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,660
How do I look now?
They're kind of not fit back yet.

227
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,320
I'm a strange looking guy.
Rogan.

228
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,340
I mean,
how long has it taken for eyebrows to

229
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:42,870
grow back?
It could be a lifetime.

230
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,470
That's fucking nuts.
That's so weird.

231
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:48,720
Like I,
I thought eyebrows would be like a

232
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,940
beard.
Like you don't really have hair on my

233
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:53,790
body.
You don't feel like your body here.

234
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,550
Like my sister's never shaved her legs.
Look,

235
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:58,920
Greg Fitzsimmons everybody come on in
Greg.

236
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,410
Fuck yeah,
get in here buddy.

237
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,560
We saved you a spot.
Isn't this cool?

238
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,830
Hi Greg.
Good.

239
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,673
You are for here.

240
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,230
This one's fine.
Okay,

241
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,990
beautiful.
Welcome to Hitler's bunker.

242
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,200
I know.
Can we geva no.

243
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,570
How would you say,
how was your set?

244
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,990
You know,
it was one of those crowds where if you

245
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:24,810
did new shit that you were excited
about,

246
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,890
they were with you and as soon as you
did a bit that had any dust on it,

247
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,650
they just fucking flatlined.
So do you think

248
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,400
that was you or they felt they felt it
and you

249
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,000
always,
definitely me.

250
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,680
It was me because I felt like when you
have new stuff,

251
00:10:42,681 --> 00:10:46,610
you get so excited about doing it that
you come alive and you're,

252
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:48,830
you're not reciting it.
You're really saying it.

253
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:52,070
And then when the transition into shit
that you've been doing for too long,

254
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:56,060
you lose that freshness and they sensed
this as difference between the,

255
00:10:56,061 --> 00:10:57,110
the material.

256
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,610
There's a moment when you're doing an
old bit where you're,

257
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,020
you have so much shame and you try it.
He tried to like reignite it,

258
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,170
power it up and it doesn't work.
Oh,

259
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,270
why am I still doing this?
Fucking shitty.

260
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,850
Yay.
Yay.

261
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:15,070
It's like when you see a guy yelling at
his son and a parking lot and he doesn't

262
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,810
even believe it.
He's just doing it because he thinks

263
00:11:16,811 --> 00:11:17,980
that's how it filed.
They suppose that,

264
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:18,570
yeah.

265
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:22,030
You know what's even worse is when you
see someone yelling at their kid and

266
00:11:22,031 --> 00:11:25,390
then you look over and you make eye
contact with them and they realize they

267
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:27,790
shouldn't be yelling at their kid and
lost their cool.

268
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,460
Plus.
I can imagine you are looking at a guy

269
00:11:30,461 --> 00:11:32,380
who was yelling at his kid.
There's probably a little bit of a

270
00:11:32,381 --> 00:11:34,600
medicine left on your face.
I try not to be,

271
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,610
I try to be kind.
Yeah.

272
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:41,180
I don't want to be menacing to parents
or audiences for them.

273
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,090
I don't know.
I don't yell at my kids,

274
00:11:43,091 --> 00:11:45,510
man.
I might raise my voice occasionally if

275
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:48,070
we're doing something really fucked up,
like they're being mean to each other.

276
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,390
But,
uh,

277
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:53,790
I remember people yelling at me,
man like that the cortisol rhythm

278
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,030
reaction,
you know,

279
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:58,810
that happens in a kid's brain and all
those stress hormones that get released,

280
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,680
it's like there's plenty of fucking bad
shit going on in the world.

281
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,930
They don't need their parents yelling at
him too well,

282
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:06,400
especially when you put it in
perspective,

283
00:12:06,401 --> 00:12:11,110
like your parent at any given time is
possibly three or four times bigger than

284
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:11,801
you.
Oh yeah.

285
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:13,630
And then when they yell at you on top of
that,

286
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:16,720
that's really,
that's fucking intimidating.

287
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,000
Well,
like a couple of pussies.

288
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:21,280
Right.
And we have kids become a pussy.

289
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,580
You definitely do.
In a certain way you become a pussy.

290
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,080
Yeah.
You definitely,

291
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,380
the good thing about that,
me not yelling is my fucking six year

292
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:33,610
old is not even remotely scared of me.
Not even a little shit.

293
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,490
She mocks me like openly.
Like I go,

294
00:12:36,491 --> 00:12:37,600
hey listen,
you can't do that.

295
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,710
Shoot.
Yeah.

296
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,890
She sticks her tongue out at me and
she's not even like a little nervous

297
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:44,050
around me.
Like maybe I should be a little harder.

298
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,840
Just leave some videotapes a you doing
Jiu Jitsu on somebody just in a loop.

299
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,710
White teacher.
I teach my kids,

300
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,380
you know,
they take martial arts and my six year

301
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:55,840
old is actually a higher rank than my a
eight year old.

302
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,100
Oh really?
Yeah.

303
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,000
I think that gives them the confidence
to talk smack at you now.

304
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,170
No,
it hits me.

305
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:03,610
I can block it.
No,

306
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,280
I don't think that's it.
I just think they know I'm not going to

307
00:13:06,281 --> 00:13:07,470
do anything.
They,

308
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,100
they beat the shit out of me though.
They're allowed to hit me like a cause.

309
00:13:11,101 --> 00:13:12,670
There are a lot of practice techniques
on me.

310
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,630
I laugh at them full blast leg kicks.
So especially my eight year old,

311
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:19,780
she could fucking hit hard man.
She'll like step into a leg kick and

312
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,050
cry.
Like you know,

313
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,790
she lets me know she's going to do it,
but I let her do it so she could feel

314
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,130
what it's like to hit a real person.
Like as hard as you want.

315
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,540
Yeah.
You're her meat puppet.

316
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,220
Yeah.
It's interesting.

317
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,960
You know Jeff Ross,
a black belt in taekwondo.

318
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,400
I did know that.
Yeah.

319
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:40,830
What year did you begin to digress?
I was not even 11 host who's a junior

320
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:43,690
black belt.
Easy Buddy.

321
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,090
Hey,
that's nice though.

322
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,900
It says it's great if you find a major
lack,

323
00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:51,730
but I had a teach adults in order to get
my black belt,

324
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,290
he really to teach adults.
Really?

325
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,620
That was part of the test.
You learn a lot when you teach.

326
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,450
That's true.
Your son's a black belt,

327
00:13:58,451 --> 00:13:59,200
right?
Yeah.

328
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,970
Junior black belt,
junior black belt,

329
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,570
and he did it for like eight years.
A lot of different schools that I've

330
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:09,330
looked at that age was pretty great.
What's tough is once they get the black

331
00:14:09,331 --> 00:14:12,460
belt,
there's not new forms to learn.

332
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,790
It's just perfecting what you've already
learned and a lot does a big dropoff

333
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,340
because kids are so,
and they're so used to getting a new

334
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:20,410
belt and learning new,
what do they call it?

335
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,110
Katas.
Yeah,

336
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,860
depending on it's either,
yeah,

337
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,390
it's a,
depending on what,

338
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:30,070
what style Art Katas is actually a
Japanese word and it depends on what

339
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:31,660
martial art,
like in Taekwondo,

340
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:34,600
I think they called it wasn't boom says,
yeah.

341
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,980
Says,
and it's different for other styles of

342
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,710
Korean martial arts.
I have a different name for it too,

343
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,420
but um,
yeah.

344
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:45,070
Well you can go to higher degrees
though.

345
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,780
You can get like a second degree.
Third,

346
00:14:46,781 --> 00:14:48,410
it takes a while.
Yeah.

347
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,440
It takes a different mentality to go to
that level.

348
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,940
Yeah.
That is a thing,

349
00:14:52,941 --> 00:14:54,500
man.
Once people achieve black belt,

350
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:56,090
they feel like they're done.
You know,

351
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,920
they're,
the mountain has been climbed.

352
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,010
No.
That's one thing that you'd done.

353
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,360
Well I guess he kind of have that at all
martial arts,

354
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,750
but TACO window,
you're doing a lot of,

355
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:08,510
uh,
like light contact sparring,

356
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,980
you know,
and because of that,

357
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,600
I think,
uh,

358
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:16,460
it's not as engaging as like Jiu Jitsu
because Ju Jitsu is kind of like full

359
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:18,410
blast because you're not hitting each
other.

360
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,230
You just like doing chokes and arm bars
and stuff like that.

361
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,330
And as long as someone has control,
like,

362
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,710
you know,
and they don't hurt you.

363
00:15:24,711 --> 00:15:25,341
Like,
you know,

364
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,640
when someone is in a bad position,
you don't like if you know you have

365
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:30,950
someone's arm and there it's totally
locked out.

366
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:32,780
Even if they're not tapping,
you're not going to break it.

367
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,280
You know what to do.
You know,

368
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:35,780
like when it's breaking and when it's
not.

369
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,470
So
I usually just wait till somebody gets

370
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,000
interaction.
Then we call it a day.

371
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,380
Do you finish them off?

372
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,270
Oh yeah.
Fuck yeah man.

373
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,350
I was just saying any joke last night on
your shell and just kind of came up,

374
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:50,290
but somebody goes,
ah,

375
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,520
I see this guy goes,
I'd have sex with you.

376
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,160
And I go,
I go,

377
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:54,921
oh,
that's nice.

378
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:58,250
He goes,
he goes,

379
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,810
he goes,
but I'd be the top.

380
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,080
I go,
of course you'd be the top.

381
00:16:01,081 --> 00:16:04,070
Because the only way,
and he was fucking me is I'm flat on my

382
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:06,920
face and you just tackled me and it's
probably a threeway.

383
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,300
That's the only way I'm getting fucked
as these two guys and I'm the bottom.

384
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:17,350
There's something there could be.
What's the closest he ever came to fool

385
00:16:18,691 --> 00:16:19,640
around with a guy,
Jeff,

386
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,420
right now.
Not Close.

387
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,990
Not Close at all.
This conversation you ever got high and

388
00:16:25,991 --> 00:16:26,824
like,
uh,

389
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,330
not
what happened.

390
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,540
He just cut himself off.
He's like,

391
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:35,780
God can't,
you can't.

392
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,030
You know what he's thinking now.
This is part of the problem with being

393
00:16:40,031 --> 00:16:41,860
the roastmaster.
You think someone's going to use this

394
00:16:41,861 --> 00:16:42,970
one to me in a roast?

395
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,530
Yeah.
It could be a real shot.

396
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,510
Soft under belly.

397
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:50,120
Do you think you'll ever wound up
battling on Rose Battle?

398
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,480
Definitely road.
I think you already preparing.

399
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,640
No,
I just think about how it would work.

400
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:58,760
You know,
I look at like who I would be fun to

401
00:16:58,761 --> 00:16:59,780
battle.
You know,

402
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:03,500
I'm obviously a big,
easy target for a guy who works the door

403
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:04,940
here.
He's going to destroy me,

404
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,120
you know,
like it's like of course how the mighty

405
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:09,950
will fall,
but I still think it would be fun

406
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:13,460
anyway.
What does it feel like knowing that you

407
00:17:13,461 --> 00:17:15,530
roasted the president of the United
States?

408
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,630
You rose to trump is it is totally and
totally a weird feeling.

409
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:25,930
And I saw him a couple of weeks ago.
I saw him down in Florida and exchanged

410
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:29,390
pleasantries and I'll let you your kid
and you were just talking about that on

411
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:30,620
stage.
I saw him,

412
00:17:30,621 --> 00:17:32,620
uh,
in Palm Beach and uh,

413
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,350
his golf course and his golf course
having lunch

414
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,820
already stand your life,
Jeff.

415
00:17:39,821 --> 00:17:44,330
Ross is life is like nobody else.
I follow him on fucking instagram and

416
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,500
like every night he's in a different
city with a different set of cool

417
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:48,090
people.

418
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,680
Well,
when you're a man,

419
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:51,120
you don't have children,
right?

420
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,130
Not Married.
You can do whatever the fuck do you want

421
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:54,660
Jesus.
What a life.

422
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,760
Yeah,
you really do have a good life in that

423
00:17:56,761 --> 00:17:58,320
regard.
You're free as a bird.

424
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,600
It is cool.
How the fuck have you managed to not get

425
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:03,330
tied down?
I'm ready to get tied down.

426
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,690
I already,
I wish I'd say they say that I wish I

427
00:18:05,691 --> 00:18:07,020
was meeting.
Who could?

428
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:11,220
Who could do that are around us.
That's not true.

429
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,440
I would like to settle down.
Really?

430
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,090
Yeah.
I haven't met the right person.

431
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,830
Hmm.
Well,

432
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:17,990
how come you haven't met the right
person?

433
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,450
You're in a new city every night.
You fuck constantly travel maybe.

434
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:23,520
Yeah.
Maybe I'm looking in the wrong way.

435
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,200
Do you think he came close a couple
times?

436
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,850
Do you think you'll have a little jeff
someday?

437
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:29,040
I really hope so.
I really how old?

438
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:33,190
He knew 51 that's all over.
Why?

439
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,530
Because your was bad.

440
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,610
I really think so.

441
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,470
If it tastes good,
it's probably better.

442
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,260
It's probably like middle freak me out.
Don't freak me out.

443
00:18:45,261 --> 00:18:48,280
You already told me that the Bruce Lee
video wasn't where he thought.

444
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,050
The Bruce Lee video.
Bruce Lee playing ping pong with

445
00:18:51,051 --> 00:18:52,310
nunchucks.
He thought that was rude.

446
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:59,610
How are you serious?
They're round known checks are brown and

447
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:02,640
blue.
Fuck his back.

448
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,600
Good time.
It you'd have to time.

449
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,210
I like the ping pong.
It's not like a paddle.

450
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:11,340
This is like a rigid thing where you can
kind of hit it.

451
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:15,060
You hit the time to swing it a thing.
I thought it was a bad ass.

452
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,620
Well,
he was definitely a bad ass.

453
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,570
No doubt about it.
Huh?

454
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,530
He was the original mixed martial
artist.

455
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,330
Yeah.
You think might come as bad.

456
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,010
It's probably not good.
It's probably not good.

457
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:28,011
You probably have to get a nephew or
somebody to kick in some of Greg's com.

458
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,950
Greg still got a couple of good swimmers
in this terrible news.

459
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:37,200
At a certain age when men have children,
there is a high risk of autism is

460
00:19:37,201 --> 00:19:41,190
somebody was mocking trump,
I think it was Rosie O'donnell was

461
00:19:41,191 --> 00:19:44,580
mocking trump's kid.
Donald did.

462
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,990
Yeah.
Which I thought was like,

463
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,610
wow,
I know that.

464
00:19:47,611 --> 00:19:49,850
He said some fucked up shit about her.
Uh,

465
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,920
going after his kid like that.
It's like that's how it shows you how

466
00:19:52,921 --> 00:19:54,210
much he hurt her.
Yeah.

467
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,950
She wrote a poem about how depressed she
was when he became president.

468
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,221
When he won.
No,

469
00:20:00,221 --> 00:20:00,610
it wasn't.

470
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:05,190
He hadn't even one yet.
He made fun of her in a debate and one

471
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:09,300
of the debates he was talking like
someone said he talked bad about women.

472
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,890
He's like,
well Rosie O'donnell,

473
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,970
what?
Everybody agrees with me.

474
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,440
Yeah.
And he like,

475
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:15,870
he got a laugh and apparently she was
just,

476
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,620
she called this kid autistic later.
It was after that,

477
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,110
like after that.
I think she was just like crushed.

478
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,270
Yeah,
she was talking about how sad she was

479
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:27,390
and I like she couldn't go outside and
have been seen as kid.

480
00:20:27,391 --> 00:20:30,930
Does he look autistic?
Suck a fucking kid know he's a tall,

481
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:33,560
good looking kid.
He's got a launch kit.

482
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:38,690
He gave him Rhode Island for Christmas.
The comedy store.

483
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,600
Well the kids 10 and he's 70 yeah.
Yeah.

484
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,010
I mean so he 60 when he

485
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:52,360
shot one in Jesus.
Because the thing is now you just think

486
00:20:52,361 --> 00:20:54,370
about how much your cell phone is in
your pocket,

487
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,720
how many waves are going through your
Siem and all the time you don't put it

488
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:00,400
in your pocket.
You do.

489
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,510
Why does everybody think that radiation
is bad?

490
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,620
I remember when we were kids.
Yeah,

491
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,470
Comic Book Guys got Radiation.
Those are the heroes,

492
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,130
but then became heroes.
Don't sit too close to the TV they used

493
00:21:11,131 --> 00:21:11,911
to tell you.
Yeah,

494
00:21:11,911 --> 00:21:13,980
they were worried about that.
But I think that was for your eyes.

495
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,443
Right,
but like,

496
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,420
like radiation in comic books,
it always does.

497
00:21:18,421 --> 00:21:19,530
Good Shit.
Yeah.

498
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,260
You know,
people get the right.

499
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,680
People go radiation when they're ill.
It's a healing thing now.

500
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,010
Not really.
They do to kill the tumor,

501
00:21:29,011 --> 00:21:32,760
but it kills you to,
it just kills the tumor more that it

502
00:21:32,761 --> 00:21:35,100
kills you.
It kills the tumor first and it brings

503
00:21:35,101 --> 00:21:40,101
you to the door of death and then you
pull back and start drinking wheat grass

504
00:21:40,201 --> 00:21:41,340
juice and getting your life together.

505
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,320
That's right.
I just started some probiotics online

506
00:21:44,321 --> 00:21:44,920
today.

507
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,640
Oh yeah.
You should eat the um,

508
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,670
actual live probiotics.
Oh really?

509
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,970
Yeah.
She Yogurt Kiefer's.

510
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,270
Yeah,
all that stuff.

511
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:55,270
I'm a big proponent of probiotics.
I eat a lot of it,

512
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:56,101
man.
It's huge.

513
00:21:56,101 --> 00:21:57,820
Like what,
what is that Kim Cheat?

514
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:58,780
Well,
probiotics is,

515
00:21:58,781 --> 00:22:02,350
anytime you're taking in like healthy
bacteria,

516
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,690
like a,
whether it's in the form of yogurt,

517
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:08,860
Acidophilus,
a Sauerkraut is actually a healthy,

518
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,400
especially raw sauerkraut.
Actually a very good probiotic.

519
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:13,720
Huh?
Really good for you.

520
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,210
It was a lot of like natural food
stores,

521
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:20,710
like whole foods type places that have
probiotic sauerkrauts really good for

522
00:22:20,711 --> 00:22:23,920
you because it's fermented and anytime
you fermenting something,

523
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,920
what's happening is like this bacteria
is,

524
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,880
uh,
is,

525
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,670
you know,
living on the food.

526
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,950
So like,
like when you're eating Kimchi,

527
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:35,710
there's bacteria living on the food,
but it's healthy bacteria.

528
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,350
Okay.

529
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:40,750
Cause I fart so bad and it's been,
it's been years,

530
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,720
I think it caught grd.
And when I was down in Florida really?

531
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:46,540
And it just rings or creek,
no tap water in Florida,

532
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:47,710
man,
you're not supposed to drink it.

533
00:22:47,711 --> 00:22:51,070
It's the worst tap water in America.
But because it's a sandbar,

534
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:52,690
there's no fucking fresh water down
there.

535
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,110
Yeah.
But it's an all tap water treated with

536
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,160
chlorine.
Yeah.

537
00:22:57,161 --> 00:22:59,310
But there's only so much they can do
with that shit down there.

538
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,920
Look at those people.
And so I started farting and it just,

539
00:23:02,921 --> 00:23:04,870
I took,
I went on all kinds of antibiotics and I

540
00:23:04,871 --> 00:23:08,020
got rid of like a bulk of it.
But the farts have remained.

541
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,340
And so somebody told me to probe
probiotics can clear it up if you ever

542
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:13,740
heard that when people get poop,
um,

543
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,940
transfusions now,
yeah.

544
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:17,870
They'll take poop from a healthy
personal,

545
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,690
yes.
Yes.

546
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,150
It's a real fast to ass.

547
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,790
Well,
they don't make you go,

548
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:27,200
but I think they go in and fish it out
and they shoot it up in you.

549
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,210
Well,
they literally will shoot somebody

550
00:23:29,211 --> 00:23:32,240
else's poop up your up your asshole into
your body.

551
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,220
Yeah.
And some people even swallow poop

552
00:23:34,221 --> 00:23:36,230
tablets.
Wow.

553
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,610
Yeah.
Did never heard that.

554
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,510
Yeah.
Yeah.

555
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:39,823
They do.
To,

556
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,410
um,
to people that have like really

557
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,020
unhealthy gut biomes.
And one of the,

558
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:49,040
with a lot of people is antibiotics.
When you take antibiotics,

559
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:52,400
it doesn't just kill the bad stuff.
It kills good stuff too.

560
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,990
Oh,
they just had the first woman who

561
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:56,420
couldn't be cured by antibiotics that
you read about that?

562
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,380
No.
Yeah,

563
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,110
she had some kind of a,
I don't know what it was.

564
00:24:00,111 --> 00:24:02,580
It was some kind of a,
a bacteria commercial.

565
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,360
You know,
I,

566
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,070
I wish I knew more about the story,
but um,

567
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,090
I dunno.

568
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,420
Maybe we can look it up on the Internet,
but it was the first time that they

569
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:16,310
tried every type of antibiotic and it
didn't work and they said that this

570
00:24:16,311 --> 00:24:20,070
could mark the beginning of untreatable
viruses.

571
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:22,180
So bacteria virus,
I guess bacteria.

572
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,740
Bacteria is right.
You don't treat viruses with

573
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:27,200
antibiotics?
I don't think so.

574
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,960
You tune antiviral medications a
different thing,

575
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,110
right?
We've but bacteria like as far as,

576
00:24:33,111 --> 00:24:35,450
um,
like the stuff that you get like from

577
00:24:35,451 --> 00:24:39,310
staph infections and stuff like that has
gotten stronger and stronger over the

578
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:39,920
years.
Yeah.

579
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,420
Especially in hospitals,
man.

580
00:24:41,421 --> 00:24:44,270
There's a lot of people that catch
Murcia from hospitals and they fucking

581
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:45,440
wind up dying.
Yeah.

582
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,910
Hell yeah.
Big issue.

583
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,010
Guys are really depressing me.
I'm sorry.

584
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,993
Come on man.
Do you have a,

585
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,650
do you have a light?
Yeah,

586
00:24:51,651 --> 00:24:52,484
I do.
Yeah,

587
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:57,740
so,
so we are in the final hours before the

588
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:58,910
inauguration.

589
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:01,280
The inauguration.
It's a crazy time.

590
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:05,060
I didn't think that I would be this.
I really thought after the election I

591
00:25:05,061 --> 00:25:07,610
would wrap my head around it and I would
be like,

592
00:25:07,611 --> 00:25:08,690
okay,
this is normal.

593
00:25:08,691 --> 00:25:12,020
Trump is going to be president.
Like I would have some sense of like,

594
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,990
okay,
I don't feel any more,

595
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,200
um,
uh,

596
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,410
ready for this.
Then I was denied after the election.

597
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,910
No,
it's weird.

598
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,550
It's 100% weird.
I was watching this video that someone

599
00:25:25,551 --> 00:25:27,140
was playing,
um,

600
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:31,160
on their instagram page where they were
there while trump was walking into this

601
00:25:31,161 --> 00:25:36,161
room and DC and surrounded by secret
service agents and all these sycophants

602
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:38,690
and all these weird people around them.

I'll just say right now ladies,
get your abortions before noon tomorrow.

623
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,360
Don't you think trump's had a lot of
girls get abortions?

624
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:31,220
I think he's going to back off.
Are you shitting me?

625
00:26:31,221 --> 00:26:34,340
He's got a frequent fetus card.
Oh yeah.

626
00:26:34,341 --> 00:26:35,030
He's,
he's,

627
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,430
he's driven a few ladies off it to the
clinic.

628
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,200
Of course.
Absolutely.

629
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,790
That's his thing.
Well,

630
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:44,550
they were saying that about Gw Bush is
that there was a pretty well documented

631
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:47,640
case when he was in college.
Pretty good at Texas or something.

632
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,570
Yeah.
Uh,

633
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,040
that he,
that he went to college,

634
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,041
he went to,
he went,

635
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:55,680
he went to Yale.
Didn't he know Wharton School of

636
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:56,620
business?
No.

637
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,473
That's trump

638
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:01,030
talking about gw.
We didn't want to go to you.

639
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,380
Yeah.
Yeah,

640
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,780
because he was in his colon bones.
Right.

641
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,390
Cheat all the bushes.
Right.

642
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,600
That's one of those grandfathered in
things though,

643
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:10,470
right?
Oh yeah.

644
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,570
Yeah.
Your whole family.

645
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,630
Barbara Bush double suicide to get out
of going to the,

646
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:20,760
all right.
What do they do it hospital.

647
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,700
Really?
Yeah.

648
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,900
Yeah.
They're both time right now on.

649
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,620
Why don't we just start taking our
money?

650
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:31,350
Can you charge?
He maybe we should stop taking a better

651
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:35,310
car.
We won't have to go to the inauguration.

652
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:43,110
I want to go skydiving.
I is Martha Washington and my Bedroom

653
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,070
Jab.
Put that down,

654
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,940
see him for years.
And then I saw him recently and he was

655
00:27:46,941 --> 00:27:50,030
in a wheelchair on some,
some interview in some video and it made

656
00:27:50,031 --> 00:27:51,590
you realize like,
wow,

657
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,680
it's been a while.
Think that Carter is still alive and a w

658
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,500
is still alive.
He holds Carter Bush.

659
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:03,210
He's old.
He was old president 76 was he?

660
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,030
Yeah,
he was already old.

661
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,820
Yeah,
he was an interesting guy,

662
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:08,990
man.
You know,

663
00:28:08,991 --> 00:28:13,520
Carter didn't really get a fair shake.
Who's a go to the presidential library?

664
00:28:13,521 --> 00:28:15,830
Carter's in Atlanta is awesome.
You should check it out.

665
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,350
Well,
I heard some speeches that he gave

666
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,440
before when he was running for president
back when hunters Thompson recorded less

667
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:27,440
speech that he gave at one of those
Washington's it out.

668
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:32,770
No,
I'm good.

669
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,950
I'm good too.
Oh Jesus.

670
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,900
It was a,
it was in that movie.

671
00:28:38,901 --> 00:28:41,780
Fear and loathing,
not fear in loading the other one,

672
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,840
um,
Gonzo the life and works of Dr. Hunter s

673
00:28:44,841 --> 00:28:46,130
Thompson,
the documentary on him.

674
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,470
Really interesting man.
Like Carter was,

675
00:28:48,471 --> 00:28:51,770
you know,
he was pretty intense and moral guy like

676
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,570
very,
very powerfully.

677
00:28:53,571 --> 00:28:53,950
So

678
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:56,290
he was a good Christian.
He was the good kind of Christian.

679
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:02,290
Well because I think people can use
Christianity as a way of feeling better

680
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:03,100
then.
Yeah.

681
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,190
Or you can be or it can be a life of
service and he was very much,

682
00:29:06,191 --> 00:29:08,390
life is service but there's like two,
there's like the,

683
00:29:08,391 --> 00:29:11,800
the the way that like my dad goes to
church still just cause he just likes

684
00:29:11,801 --> 00:29:14,560
the people that are there more so than
anything else.

685
00:29:14,561 --> 00:29:18,280
He's like I just want to go see fucking
people that I've known for 40 years.

686
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,260
He's like,
I don't really listen to ever.

687
00:29:20,261 --> 00:29:24,010
I mean like my dad is a tourist had just
fallen asleep and park every single

688
00:29:24,011 --> 00:29:26,200
time.
He just there to like see some friends

689
00:29:26,201 --> 00:29:28,110
before and after.
It's a fucking,

690
00:29:28,111 --> 00:29:29,320
it's a club.
But do you love?

691
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,431
I mean,
cause here's,

692
00:29:30,431 --> 00:29:32,760
I'm,
I go back and forth on religion because

693
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:35,260
it's so easy to take like the,
uh,

694
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,630
you know,
the agnostic route and say that all

695
00:29:37,631 --> 00:29:42,010
religion is evil and all that,
but it's like so much good has happened

696
00:29:42,011 --> 00:29:43,850
because of organized religion.
I'm,

697
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,680
you look at what the Jews have done in
this country with the just fucking

698
00:29:47,681 --> 00:29:50,920
hospitals alone.
And then you got Christians that had

699
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:52,610
gone to Central America,
you know,

700
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:56,350
nuns that of fucking save villages and
know for sure.

701
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,320
Yeah.
There's tons of good stuff.

702
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,500
I think it's,
I think the cheap fucking route is to

703
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:01,440
say that religion sucks just because
that's a blunt,

704
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,350
easy blanket to go fuck religion.
It's just caused every war.

705
00:30:05,351 --> 00:30:06,520
It's the worst thing.
It's like,

706
00:30:06,521 --> 00:30:07,870
yeah,
there's a lot of fucking negatives to

707
00:30:07,871 --> 00:30:08,310
it.

708
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:08,871
Yeah.
You know,

709
00:30:08,871 --> 00:30:12,510
that blamed it on every war.
But war is something that's caused by

710
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:15,540
people and people would have found a
reason to go to war.

711
00:30:15,541 --> 00:30:19,530
They go to war because they're apes,
they go to war because apes fight

712
00:30:19,531 --> 00:30:21,900
against apes.
It's like they're always dominating for

713
00:30:21,901 --> 00:30:24,720
that Alpha position.
If they're blaming it on religion,

714
00:30:24,721 --> 00:30:27,300
it's just a convenient reason to go fuck
somebody up.

715
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,630
They would have done it if they had
diamonds or they'd do it for oil.

716
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,800
Yeah.
That's the thing in Ireland,

717
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:35,650
they try to pretend that the,
it's a war between the Protestants and

718
00:30:35,651 --> 00:30:36,431
the Catholics.
No,

719
00:30:36,431 --> 00:30:40,870
it's the fucking Brits trying to
colonize and destroy a population of

720
00:30:40,871 --> 00:30:41,650
people.
Yeah,

721
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:42,360
that's it.

722
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,430
And people get tribal.
They did.

723
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,660
You know,
people will fight.

724
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,820
The fucking raiders will fight the
eagles.

725
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:51,240
You know the fans.
We'll meet in the parking lot and have a

726
00:30:51,241 --> 00:30:56,010
fucking gang.
That's just what people do for a shirt

727
00:30:56,011 --> 00:30:58,350
color.
They just want the people do mean didn't

728
00:30:58,351 --> 00:31:01,280
they?
They beat some guy almost to death in

729
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,720
dodger stadium.
They put him in a coma.

730
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,250
Horrible.
San Francisco Fan.

731
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,110
Some guy with his kid,
right?

732
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,180
Yeah.
Kids.

733
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,810
His kids with him.
And he was dead.

734
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,400
Two dudes just,
I think the kid was autistic,

735
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:18,100
was he was going to say help himself.
His

736
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,460
instincts took over.
He was autistic.

737
00:31:21,461 --> 00:31:23,770
Yeah.
It's just crazy how tribal people are

738
00:31:23,771 --> 00:31:26,380
and that's one of the things that you're
seeing with the selection too,

739
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:30,480
whether you're a trump supporter or a
hillary supporter or a Bernie supporter,

740
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,800
whatever.
If you just can step back from it for a

741
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:35,770
second and look at it objectively,
what you're seeing is these people that

742
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:40,771
are like blindly loyal to one side or
the other and then you just see giant

743
00:31:41,891 --> 00:31:45,820
clumps of them that move in that
direction and very few people who look

744
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:50,050
at it and have like a balanced
perspective that's outside of like an

745
00:31:50,051 --> 00:31:51,440
ideology.
Very.

746
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,270
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

747
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,340
Like very few people are going,
well,

748
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:59,380
we got this guy who won a popularity
contest and he's the first actually

749
00:31:59,381 --> 00:32:03,160
popular person who wants popularity
contest and everybody else who's been

750
00:32:03,161 --> 00:32:04,390
one of its popularity contest.

751
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,610
It's just spinning this one select
group.

752
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:11,320
So in that sense it's a good thing
because it's going to be a disruptive

753
00:32:11,321 --> 00:32:14,920
thing and this system is not good.
It's not good to have the same fucking

754
00:32:14,921 --> 00:32:18,520
families run the country over and over
again and have the same bureaucracy,

755
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:21,370
that same red tape,
all the shit that people have had to

756
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:24,370
deal with when it comes to politics.
Like it's not a perfect system and it's

757
00:32:24,371 --> 00:32:26,620
not getting improved.
One of the reasons it doesn't get

758
00:32:26,621 --> 00:32:29,120
improved just cause the people that run
the system have a,

759
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,861
uh,
they have,

760
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:31,240
uh,
like a concerted,

761
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,330
it was,
there's a great benefit for them to keep

762
00:32:34,331 --> 00:32:36,190
the system in place.
There's plenty of job,

763
00:32:36,191 --> 00:32:38,740
there's plenty of people doing it.
There's plenty of red tape.

764
00:32:38,741 --> 00:32:40,070
There's of confused as plenty

765
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:45,070
of debate in influence and,
and it goes back and forth from side to

766
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:49,400
side and all that keeps it relevant and
it keeps people from stopping and

767
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,440
saying,
why are there these two groups?

768
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,310
One is right and one is left,
one's conservative ones liberal.

769
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,790
When most of us are a combination of all
those things.

770
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,010
Well not only that,
it's a,

771
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:00,940
it's,
you know,

772
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:05,970
it's all projections by the big business
to say there's even a right and a left.

773
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,380
They,
they've got both there pulling the

774
00:33:08,381 --> 00:33:09,910
strings on both sides.
Yeah.

775
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,400
Yeah,
I was saying that,

776
00:33:11,401 --> 00:33:13,750
that,
that I remember like coming around the

777
00:33:13,751 --> 00:33:16,570
store and listen to people at the
beginning of the campaign in trump's

778
00:33:16,571 --> 00:33:17,710
campaign,
you know,

779
00:33:17,711 --> 00:33:21,760
like vehemently hated him so much and,
and that kind of like extremism was the

780
00:33:21,761 --> 00:33:24,490
same for like Bernie support.
Like the Bernie chaos.

781
00:33:24,491 --> 00:33:27,490
Like the Bernie thing was crazy.
I mean it was like the same kind of

782
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,870
crazy Catholic like fuck anybody but
Bernie and the trump supporters are the

783
00:33:31,871 --> 00:33:32,704
same way.
I was like,

784
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:36,640
fuck anybody but Donald Trump,
it was like extremes on both sides.

785
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,040
And it's the same thing.
At some point you're,

786
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,420
you're on a level plane,
right?

787
00:33:40,421 --> 00:33:42,520
Zero is the same as a hundred.
You know what I mean?

788
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,340
Like if I said,
if I said to a friend of mine,

789
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:49,090
how gay are you on a percentage scale?
Zero to a hundred and if a guy says,

790
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,610
if a guy says,
uh,

791
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,520
a hundred,
okay,

792
00:33:51,521 --> 00:33:52,870
he's gay.
And then if a guy says,

793
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,860
second guy says,
Oh yeah,

794
00:33:53,861 --> 00:33:54,740
I'm,
you know,

795
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,960
48 I'd be like,
okay,

796
00:33:55,961 --> 00:33:56,860
I get that.
Yeah,

797
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,240
that's tendencies.
Yeah.

798
00:33:58,610 --> 00:33:59,320
Yeah,
Jeff,

799
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,270
me.
But then if a guy says zero,

800
00:34:01,271 --> 00:34:03,130
I'm zero.
Fuck that.

801
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:06,370
It's the same as the hundred guys.
Extremism is the same.

802
00:34:06,371 --> 00:34:08,080
It's just a different,
it's just a different angle.

803
00:34:08,081 --> 00:34:10,510
But there's not enough people that are
40% gay.

804
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,220
There's a lot of people in the middle of
it all.

805
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:14,300
Yeah.
And a lot of people try to say we are

806
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,890
and um,
I actually really am in defendant and

807
00:34:16,891 --> 00:34:19,110
it's like I wish,
but then you talk to them a little bit

808
00:34:19,111 --> 00:34:22,650
and they're there on one side of the,
it's very difficult because there's no

809
00:34:22,651 --> 00:34:24,990
truth anymore.
There's no paper.

810
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,450
There's no one day used to be like if
you watched,

811
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,800
you know,
CBS,

812
00:34:28,801 --> 00:34:30,030
NBC,
ABC News,

813
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,530
there was a journalistic integrity that
they subscribe to and both sides said,

814
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,140
these are the facts.
Right.

815
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:41,100
There's no news outlet any longer that
both sides look at.

816
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:43,000
No.
That's a really important point.

817
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,210
I mean,
it's very like very clear.

818
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:48,190
It's cut and dry.
How did that happen?

819
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:49,331
I don't know.
I want.

820
00:34:49,331 --> 00:34:53,110
I'm curious to know when and how,
like what at what time period of

821
00:34:53,111 --> 00:34:56,860
politics at that become the notion of
the shift of like an obvious,

822
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:00,010
this is precisely who were,
who were four and it's clear.

823
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:05,200
I was watching CNN and Fox News back and
forth like after the debate and it was

824
00:35:07,761 --> 00:35:09,020
so fascinating,
man.

825
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,940
It was like,
who is telling the truth?

826
00:35:10,941 --> 00:35:12,380
Like what?
What has happening here?

827
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,260
Because these,
he's two totally different stories and

828
00:35:15,261 --> 00:35:16,094
they're,
they're so,

829
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,920
they're so clear on one side or the
other.

830
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,660
Like Fox News,
excuse me.

831
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:26,661
It was so clear on trump's side and CNN
was so clear on Hillary's side.

832
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:32,880
It was so odd places in one day
on Fox News.

833
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,780
They just switched places overnight.
Yeah.

834
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,670
Well it's crazy.
Be One of your network and

835
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,610
the reality.
Well,

836
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:44,670
what a news do you follow Jeff?
Follow it all.

837
00:35:44,671 --> 00:35:48,000
I don't follow any news.
I watch and read a lot of news.

838
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:53,180
I always have like a aggregator on your
phone that pulls from different news

839
00:35:53,181 --> 00:35:54,930
sources,
tend to

840
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:00,210
search up topics.
I'm curious what Chris Christie is up to

841
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:03,240
this week or Al Franken or just get
someone on my mind.

842
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,840
Sometimes I go to politico and usually
there's a great angle that you hadn't

843
00:36:06,841 --> 00:36:10,260
thought of.
Politico and guardian are good for

844
00:36:10,261 --> 00:36:11,820
different angles.
The Guardian's good.

845
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:12,863
Yeah.
Cause they're,

846
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,710
you know,
they're outside the,

847
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:18,540
well originally I guess there's a lot of
their writers are Americans now.

848
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:20,580
Right.
Did you see the Guardian initially was

849
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:21,414
UK.
Yeah.

850
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,440
Yeah.
You want some water?

851
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,311
No,
I'm good too.

852
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:24,600
I don't know what's going on that we'd
strong.

853
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,960
Did you see that guardian article,
um,

854
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:30,750
by um,
Glenn Greenwald about this,

855
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:33,750
the unseats unsubstantiated attacks on
trump.

856
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,300
It was really into now,
but like fake news.

857
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,100
Yeah.
Yeah.

858
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,680
And he was talking about what,
um,

859
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,760
you know,
Eisenhower had warned about complex.

860
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:44,791
Yeah.
I was like,

861
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:47,190
wow,
this is a crazy bold article.

862
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,770
And they predicted at trump like figure
rising up.

863
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,120
Well,
it's not just that,

864
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:55,230
like he's talking about how the deep
state is attacking trump.

865
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:56,960
Like that's,
that's what he's bringing up.

866
00:36:56,961 --> 00:36:59,730
That the deep state is attacking him and
going after him.

867
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,040
Yeah.
And they're like the CIA and the

868
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,920
intelligence agencies,
like they're making some sort of a

869
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:09,360
concerted effort to,
to single him out and go after him and

870
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:11,730
destroy his person,
destroy his,

871
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:13,110
uh,
excuse me,

872
00:37:13,111 --> 00:37:14,110
destroy his,
um,

873
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,920
you know,
public persona and that that's where all

874
00:37:16,921 --> 00:37:17,880
the,
the urine,

875
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,840
you could end up now when you get into
politics,

876
00:37:20,841 --> 00:37:22,040
all this stuff,
but,

877
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:25,470
but it's the,
yeah.

878
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,190
Doesn't give a fuck about politics.
They care about the FBI and if anybody

879
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,310
crosses them the way trump already has,
they're going to set a barium.

880
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,350
Yeah.
I mean,

881
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:35,340
think about that.
When,

882
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:39,990
has there ever been a time where an
unsubstantiated story about a guy who's

883
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:43,080
the president elect about peeing on
beds?

884
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,150
They talked about that like so openly.
Yeah,

885
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,300
it's been,
it's been so open.

886
00:37:48,301 --> 00:37:52,710
That is last press conference.
He shut down the rumor by saying he's a

887
00:37:52,711 --> 00:37:57,390
Germaphobe.
That's how massive of a story that is.

888
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,580
That during one of the most important
press conferences,

889
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:03,090
he addressed that fucking thing and it
didn't stop there.

890
00:38:03,091 --> 00:38:04,530
Then he went on to talk about,
well,

891
00:38:04,531 --> 00:38:06,120
you know,
everybody knows this camera is in the

892
00:38:06,121 --> 00:38:07,140
room.
I mean,

893
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:08,610
you know,
what am I stupid?

894
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,030
What am I,
am morally was the weight of I stupid.

895
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,050
Unbelievable.
Yeah.

896
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:19,650
And then you watched how he,
I don't think I've ever seen,

897
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,300
I mean,
this might be me being ignorant,

898
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:24,360
but I don't know if I've ever seen a
president in a press conference or

899
00:38:24,361 --> 00:38:28,290
president elect shut down a source like
he did.

900
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:29,910
CNN was like,
I won't talk to you.

901
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,770
I absolutely like,
I don't know if I've ever seen a

902
00:38:31,771 --> 00:38:36,130
president single one out.
And then they probably slyly ignore

903
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,900
certain journalists that they don't want
to fucking talk to.

904
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,850
But I've never seen one to be like,
I don't talk to see it.

905
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,650
I don't talk to that new source.
Fuck you.

906
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:44,050
Well,
I think that there is a protocol for who

907
00:38:44,051 --> 00:38:45,850
you go to first.
Like for years,

908
00:38:45,851 --> 00:38:50,680
the first question always went to that
one old woman from the Associated Press.

909
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,633
From the,
yeah,

910
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,950
she was always the first question.
And then,

911
00:38:53,951 --> 00:38:55,300
um,
and then after that,

912
00:38:55,301 --> 00:38:58,120
I think it was,
there was a certain pecking order to it.

913
00:38:58,121 --> 00:39:00,220
And,
and trump just basically said,

914
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,080
you know,
I'm going to,

915
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,560
I'm going to choose what news and
questions you guys here from now on is

916
00:39:07,691 --> 00:39:10,300
not that the press corps is no longer
traveling with him.

917
00:39:10,301 --> 00:39:13,990
It's the first time a president has not
had the press corps with him at all

918
00:39:13,991 --> 00:39:14,920
times.
Crazy.

919
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,080
Yeah.
Cause and as well,

920
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:18,340
and his reasoning was he was like,
what are you gonna Watch me eat food?

921
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,680
That's that.
That's what he thought that they were

922
00:39:20,681 --> 00:39:20,970
at.
They,

923
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:22,120
he's like,
no,

924
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,100
they,
they're interested in what's going on.

925
00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:25,680
They,
they're interested in what this,

926
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:29,080
this conversation you might be having
with someone have some sense of

927
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:30,610
importance.
But he was like,

928
00:39:30,611 --> 00:39:32,800
I don't want you watching me do simple
shit,

929
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,900
but that's just part of their fucking
Gig.

930
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,610
Yeah.
That's what they've always done.

931
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,470
And,
and then I think about that like how

932
00:39:38,471 --> 00:39:40,780
much simple shit,
if they seen where it's so annoying,

933
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,340
it's not,
they've got to be like,

934
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:44,140
fuck,
this is so boring.

935
00:39:44,141 --> 00:39:46,930
Especially when they get on Air Force
One and they're going to fucking Russia

936
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:49,610
for 10 hours to sit around.
And so they can do like a,

937
00:39:49,611 --> 00:39:52,930
uh,
like a 32nd photo op and yell questions

938
00:39:52,931 --> 00:39:55,750
at him and then another 10 hour flight
home and imagine like some,

939
00:39:55,751 --> 00:39:57,100
one of the guys in the group is just
like,

940
00:39:57,101 --> 00:39:58,840
I think I'm going to go talk to him.
The other guy was like,

941
00:39:58,841 --> 00:39:59,674
don't,

942
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,730
he'll go in his room,
dude.

943
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,340
Like why?
I think we're cool now man.

944
00:40:04,341 --> 00:40:05,630
We've had some moments,
you know,

945
00:40:05,631 --> 00:40:07,910
I feel like we don't,
don't be that guy.

946
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,730
And then the rest of the nine hour plane
flight is fucking miserable.

947
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,330
He was praising Kanye West for
supporting him.

948
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,990
I remember watching it on TV.
Is this real life?

949
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:18,853
Yeah,
it was a trip.

950
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,990
Is this real lightweight?
I read the greatest.

951
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,870
I wish I know the source just because I
don't want to fucking say somebody

952
00:40:23,871 --> 00:40:25,730
else's shit.
But there was just a meme floating

953
00:40:25,731 --> 00:40:29,780
around in the Internet that said,
I bet you they,

954
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:34,780
years ago when Obama gained presidency,
there were so many fucking extremist

955
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,950
going.
I bet you the first people that are,

956
00:40:36,951 --> 00:40:39,500
he's going to talk to our rappers and
Steve Harvey

957
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:46,130
and then you see fucking zoo trough just
drags in rappers.

958
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,410
And I loved it.
I thought it was,

959
00:40:48,411 --> 00:40:49,760
I was like,
that's so fucking true.

960
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,100
How many white extremists were like,
fuck this.

961
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:54,530
Fuck.
He's going to talk to rappers in the

962
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:55,960
White House and it's trump that's doing
it.

963
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:56,930
Yeah,
it's great.

964
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,240
Yeah.
It's so funny.

965
00:40:58,241 --> 00:41:01,250
What is he talking to?
Like who else is he like publicly?

966
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,210
Well,
yeah,

967
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,360
Don King.
Don King.

968
00:41:05,361 --> 00:41:06,440
Yeah.
He loves Don King,

969
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,390
but they've had a relationship in the
past,

970
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:10,010
so like they've,
they go back.

971
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:14,420
So this is almost like he gets to invite
his actual friends to remember when

972
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,840
Obama in trouble or getting
ambassadorships.

973
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:18,900
It's going to be crazy.
No,

974
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:21,320
not,
not Christie,

975
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,220
Christie.
Nothing.

976
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,390
Nothing.
I don't need,

977
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,970
I don't mean his political friends.
I mean his friends,

978
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:30,410
his life,
France and his book buddies that he

979
00:41:30,411 --> 00:41:31,244
knows,
you know,

980
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,640
it was this man with a little bottle
attached,

981
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:33,980
that really

982
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,160
radical professor who was one of the
weathermen.

983
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,080
Is that what it was?
Is that what they call themselves.

984
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,520
And they were like doing acid and having
orgies and shit and robbing banks or

985
00:41:43,521 --> 00:41:46,010
something.
And he was like a part of that and some

986
00:41:46,011 --> 00:41:49,460
way.
And he was a professor that Obama knew

987
00:41:49,461 --> 00:41:53,750
in college and it was always this big
controversy that he knew this radical

988
00:41:53,751 --> 00:41:54,800
terrorist.
Right.

989
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,290
Obama is like some fucking sleeper guy.

990
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,580
No,
but he did have to distance himself from

991
00:42:00,581 --> 00:42:03,100
the guy because he,
the guy did have some very,

992
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:04,660
um,
pro,

993
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:06,770
uh,
succession,

994
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:09,370
what do you call it,
the blacks to think you should return to

995
00:42:09,371 --> 00:42:13,120
Africa and which you pay for it.
He was one of those guys.

996
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:15,280
Secessionist sucks.
Yeah.

997
00:42:15,281 --> 00:42:17,380
I guess succession,
succession.

998
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,950
Succession is a session.
A session session session.

999
00:42:20,951 --> 00:42:21,850
Yeah.
Just to see it.

1000
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,830
So we know he had to back off from that
guy,

1001
00:42:23,831 --> 00:42:24,620
but it,
but it's,

1002
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,950
uh,
what about the guy who,

1003
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:28,720
uh,
have you guys seen his brother?

1004
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,230
Do you know about his brother on the
playground?

1005
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:32,950
Groundwater.
Obama's brother.

1006
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,510
Do you know this account?
Have you heard about this?

1007
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:38,340
There was like a guy who's saying he's
his brother and psych.

1008
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:39,371
I,
he's like,

1009
00:42:39,371 --> 00:42:40,990
I don't support him.
I support trump.

1010
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:41,710
You,
you haven't,

1011
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:44,470
you haven't seen it pretending to be as
brief as you saw this.

1012
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,760
Yeah.
This is his half brothers,

1013
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:47,873
half brothers

1014
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,630
fake news.
I probably is.

1015
00:42:50,631 --> 00:42:53,300
Who knows.
I'm not talking about fake news.

1016
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:55,400
He was talking about it too.
I think that was fake.

1017
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,460
But trump's,

1018
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,710
but trump was fucking job.
Trump is talking to this dude like

1019
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:03,600
thanks for the support.
Thanks for not supporting your half

1020
00:43:03,601 --> 00:43:05,340
brother.
Talk about fake news.

1021
00:43:05,341 --> 00:43:10,080
How about trump ran around for three
years saying that fucking Obama wasn't

1022
00:43:10,081 --> 00:43:12,480
born in this country.
Crazy.

1023
00:43:12,481 --> 00:43:13,740
I mean that was the beginning of

1024
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,460
news.
Let me see his ID.

1025
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:18,880
Let me see his birth certificate and
then how would the irony,

1026
00:43:18,881 --> 00:43:23,290
now trump won't show his fucking taxes.
He won't.

1027
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:26,410
And because he's his excuses even after
the audits over,

1028
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:30,130
what do people need to see now?
Like that's,

1029
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,710
that's the reasoning is like what do you
want to see if the,

1030
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,440
if the,
if I get audited and I'd fucking deal

1031
00:43:35,441 --> 00:43:37,780
with the government through the audit,
what do you need to know other than

1032
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,110
we're taking care of it.
I think people want to know how much

1033
00:43:41,111 --> 00:43:43,600
money he has borrowed from China and
Russia.

1034
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:46,180
Yeah,
because that could really affect is a,

1035
00:43:46,181 --> 00:43:47,440
you know,
policy.

1036
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:48,363
Absolutely.

1037
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:52,330
I thought that that was like one of the
things that you had to divulge your

1038
00:43:52,331 --> 00:43:53,440
income.
You do.

1039
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:57,130
It wasn't a deal with Howard.
That's why Howard didn't eventually like

1040
00:43:57,131 --> 00:44:00,190
really run for governor after a certain
point because they wanted him to divulge

1041
00:44:00,191 --> 00:44:02,380
his taxes.
That's how they found out who hasn't

1042
00:44:02,381 --> 00:44:04,690
paid his taxes.
He doesn't pay taxes because of his

1043
00:44:04,691 --> 00:44:07,780
major loss a long time ago.
Oh,

1044
00:44:07,781 --> 00:44:09,760
that was that weird thing.
Atlantic city law,

1045
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:11,750
he had to make some disclosure,
but he does it.

1046
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:16,300
It's,
it's a general summary of his income.

1047
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,840
It would also say Mary has money and
certain types of ways,

1048
00:44:19,841 --> 00:44:23,380
but it's not as income taxes where you
know what he spent on phone calls and

1049
00:44:23,381 --> 00:44:26,220
security and everything and it's just
invest rico,

1050
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,810
he would also tell you how much he's
donated to charity,

1051
00:44:28,811 --> 00:44:29,620
which he doesn't want.
People

1052
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,170
didn't know.
I mean,

1053
00:44:31,171 --> 00:44:32,010
he created his own

1054
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,060
charitable,
uh,

1055
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:34,740
uh,
what do you call it?

1056
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:35,990
Charity.
Yes.

1057
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,190
Charitable charitable funds.
Charitable,

1058
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:40,380
charitable,
a charity and a,

1059
00:44:40,381 --> 00:44:42,180
and apparently he hasn't given any money
to it.

1060
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:45,360
And like two or three years,
it's just been money he solicited from

1061
00:44:45,361 --> 00:44:50,010
people on the outside to give to his
charity that then he disperses so crazy.

1062
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,410
But that's the whole thing is like,
then do we know that that's real too?

1063
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,980
Like that's the other,
I don't know.

1064
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:54,810
Right.
Hmm.

1065
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:55,590
I,
I'm,

1066
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:58,140
I would like to think that's gotta be
true,

1067
00:44:58,141 --> 00:44:59,010
but then I'm like,
I don't know.

1068
00:44:59,011 --> 00:45:02,370
Because they can,
they can solicit the records of his

1069
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:03,770
charity,
the nonprofit.

1070
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:04,361
Right,
right,

1071
00:45:04,361 --> 00:45:04,770
right,
right,

1072
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:06,410
right.
But they can't do it for his personal

1073
00:45:06,411 --> 00:45:10,770
and private
game president for 20 years.

1074
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,830
He's gonna.
He's going to change it.

1075
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,870
He's going to step aside.
Let us buddy take over like Putin did in

1076
00:45:16,871 --> 00:45:17,704
Russia.

1077
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,110
Eventually one of his kids or something.
This is,

1078
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:21,990
hello.
Came over.

1079
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,790
Get on board.
Game over.

1080
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:25,220
I think so,
yeah.

1081
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:28,020
Chris rock was seeing them on stage or
over,

1082
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,060
you know,
a bit wrapped around that.

1083
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:32,970
It was very funny and I was top of the
thing.

1084
00:45:32,971 --> 00:45:34,410
I was like,
we're all laughing,

1085
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:37,620
but if something like that did happen,
if it wasn't trump,

1086
00:45:37,621 --> 00:45:40,500
it was somebody like that.
Maybe it's the next guy to figure out

1087
00:45:40,501 --> 00:45:42,300
how to do it like that.
We,

1088
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,870
we've,
we essentially exposed the personality

1089
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:48,600
contest.
You expose the flaw in it.

1090
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:52,320
You're not looking for the best leader.
You looking for the person who's got the

1091
00:45:52,321 --> 00:45:55,960
best personality for the job.
The person who's got the best story.

1092
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:00,240
Why you fucking one?
Scott Adams,

1093
00:46:00,241 --> 00:46:02,370
the guy wrote Dilbert.
He's a really,

1094
00:46:02,371 --> 00:46:06,330
really smart guy and he predicted trump
winning a long time ago and the reason

1095
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:08,610
why predicted,
he said he's the most persuasive guy

1096
00:46:08,611 --> 00:46:09,444
I've ever seen.

1097
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,110
So He's incredibly persuasive.
He just understands the art of

1098
00:46:13,111 --> 00:46:16,590
persuasion extremely well and he's like,
just if you looked at it like

1099
00:46:16,591 --> 00:46:19,770
mathematically,
I like this guy is a really good chance

1100
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,560
and he predicted he was going to be
president and people gave him so much

1101
00:46:22,561 --> 00:46:25,950
shit and he doesn't even vote.
He's like a really interesting guy.

1102
00:46:25,951 --> 00:46:27,060
Very,
very smart guy.

1103
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:30,000
And he wasn't saying that trump is going
to be president because he's this big

1104
00:46:30,001 --> 00:46:33,300
trump supporter and he was,
it wasn't that he just,

1105
00:46:33,301 --> 00:46:35,940
he was looking at it like pragmatically.
He's like,

1106
00:46:35,941 --> 00:46:39,540
this guy has incredible abilities of
persuasion.

1107
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,050
Well,
he's broken every single rule,

1108
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:46,530
every conventional wisdom about running
for president,

1109
00:46:46,531 --> 00:46:48,610
he broke and one,
so now it's like,

1110
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,710
like you said,
Jeff,

1111
00:46:49,711 --> 00:46:51,150
who fucking knows?
Who knows?

1112
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:54,780
There's no,
there's nothing normal anymore.

1113
00:46:55,070 --> 00:47:00,070
Do you think he gets two terms easy and
then after that he's just going to line

1114
00:47:00,331 --> 00:47:04,110
up people?
There's no more term or terms no more.

1115
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:06,090
She said No.
Then it's just,

1116
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,120
there's no more voting.
I really think so.

1117
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,150
I feel like it's gonna get interesting.
I don't,

1118
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,600
I feel like he locks up his own military
is going to start.

1119
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:18,630
He's already marginalized the press.
He's told he's got,

1120
00:47:18,631 --> 00:47:21,570
he told his followers that the press is
lying,

1121
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:24,090
arresting him.
You're not impeaching stand in the White

1122
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:27,840
House for like two nights a week.
He's not even moving the fucking,

1123
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:29,290
yeah,
he's not going to,

1124
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,010
he's going

1125
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,780
to stay in these satellite White House
in New York City.

1126
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,400
He wants a satellite in Manhattan.
Should have seen the way way operates.

1127
00:47:36,401 --> 00:47:39,370
There's no way he's going to the White
House and having all that around them.

1128
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,960
You know what's so funny?
I think for a little while for them to

1129
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:47,430
make it look good,
but I am fucking freaking out right now.

1130
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:51,500
Pitch people in New York or Paul Shit.
But then you get out the trafficker and

1131
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,170
again,
he might like it there and stay.

1132
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:54,250
I could see him all,
you know,

1133
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:57,760
it was so bad.
He likes it when he can rub elbows with

1134
00:47:57,761 --> 00:48:00,220
famous people.
That's what's so funny about this

1135
00:48:00,221 --> 00:48:04,180
inauguration weekend for him is that he
couldn't get any celebrities and that's

1136
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:06,880
all he really cares about.
That was the most important thing.

1137
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:09,700
And then he got that one young,
they offered it to that one young

1138
00:48:09,701 --> 00:48:10,511
singer,
the chick,

1139
00:48:10,511 --> 00:48:12,040
and she said,
um,

1140
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:14,950
I'll,
I'll do it if I can sing.

1141
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:17,470
Um,
oh,

1142
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:21,100
what is that fucking song?
Uh,

1143
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:23,560
it's about,
it's about slavery in American,

1144
00:48:23,561 --> 00:48:25,090
about black people swinging from the
trees.

1145
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:27,190
Uh,
sweet home,

1146
00:48:27,191 --> 00:48:28,180
Alabama.
Yes.

1147
00:48:28,181 --> 00:48:29,110
That's the one.
That's it.

1148
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,080
But she basically was like,
I'll,

1149
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:36,220
I'll do it if you let me sing this song.
And of course they were like,

1150
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,240
no,
absolutely not.

1151
00:48:37,241 --> 00:48:38,640
But she was just like,
I'll come do it.

1152
00:48:38,641 --> 00:48:40,810
Does every artist in the world was like,
I'm not singing there?

1153
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:42,490
Absolutely not.
No chance,

1154
00:48:42,491 --> 00:48:43,324
no chance,
no chance.

1155
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:44,530
She was strange.
Is that,

1156
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:49,030
have you ever heard anything like that
where there's no artists that you know

1157
00:48:49,031 --> 00:48:54,031
about that want to go to that is one
country guy and he's fucking nuts.

1158
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:56,230
Who's the country guy?
Um,

1159
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:00,360
was a country guy.
His name was sang every singing.

1160
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,940
Is it Hank William Julius tonight?
Oh,

1161
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:04,300
Leo Greenwood or whatever.
Now,

1162
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,640
no bigger than this guy's huge.

1163
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:08,050
Um,
Toby Keith,

1164
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,380
Toby Keith,
and he's mad.

1165
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:12,970
He's mad.
He,

1166
00:49:12,971 --> 00:49:15,460
I think it was tonight,
actually colby teeth.

1167
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:21,830
So be Keith Lee Greenwood and three
doors down with the main doors down.

1168
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,770
They're there.
Every band.

1169
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:28,270
You've never heard that one song.
One big superman.

1170
00:49:28,271 --> 00:49:33,250
What does it Roseanne Barr.
Kryptonite bar singing the national

1171
00:49:33,251 --> 00:49:35,560
anthem issue.
Really?

1172
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:36,910
Yeah,
but they're done.

1173
00:49:36,911 --> 00:49:38,080
Yeah,
they're done.

1174
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:40,090
That's a good song.
That's the one.

1175
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:41,720
If I go crazy,
man,

1176
00:49:41,721 --> 00:49:43,730
we used to call me superman.
Right?

1177
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:45,430
Is that it?
I don't know.

1178
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:48,010
Is that a good song?
Yeah,

1179
00:49:48,011 --> 00:49:49,870
it is a good song.
But they going to sing that for him.

1180
00:49:49,871 --> 00:49:51,910
Is that going to be,
you know they have bruce springsteen

1181
00:49:51,911 --> 00:49:54,330
cover band booked and they'd fucking
canceled.

1182
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:01,310
Yeah,
I had a bruce springsteen cover bands.

1183
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:02,440
Sorry.
Done.

1184
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:06,010
We're born to run.
Well they were going to do it and then

1185
00:50:06,011 --> 00:50:08,950
they got so much shit from their fans
and then they say we're stepping down at

1186
00:50:08,951 --> 00:50:11,600
a respect to the boss.
The boss.

1187
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:15,040
Did he issue a swimming pool with this?
Did the boss say anything about it?

1188
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:17,870
I don't think he has two kids from
Delhi.

1189
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:21,550
I was wondering if he like publicly made
a statement about the fucking,

1190
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:23,410
the cover band playing.
You don't know.

1191
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:26,460
I think bruce has fans were very vocal
with these guys.

1192
00:50:26,461 --> 00:50:27,450
They did it.
They never work.

1193
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,070
You probably

1194
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,860
got an email about some fucking gig is
like the,

1195
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:35,390
I turned it down.
I bet you could find it is a good play.

1196
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:38,270
You got to get publicity move.
Yeah,

1197
00:50:38,271 --> 00:50:40,340
it is.
I bet you could find a comic that would

1198
00:50:40,341 --> 00:50:44,300
do it in a heartbeat.
I heard him once say there's a bunch of

1199
00:50:44,301 --> 00:50:45,950
you.
I'm sure there's get a bunch of these

1200
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:46,610
demons.
Yeah.

1201
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:47,570
Oh my God.
I love it.

1202
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:52,600
I heard Marlee Matlin is going to say,
I heard that.

1203
00:50:56,601 --> 00:50:58,680
I'm like,
what is the,

1204
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:03,110
or they got David Bowie,
they're going to get holograms.

1205
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:05,660
Celebrities against their wills
graduate.

1206
00:51:05,661 --> 00:51:07,480
He would do,
he did a prince hologram.

1207
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,880
I know this.
I know for the inaugural parade secret

1208
00:51:10,881 --> 00:51:14,090
services on high alert in case Donald
tries to attack somebody.

1209
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:20,540
Why didn't Kanya play?
It is at the,

1210
00:51:20,541 --> 00:51:22,340
uh,
is it another inauguration?

1211
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,310
He said he's not American enough or
something.

1212
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:29,900
I'll find the quote real quick.
Or even the people that are doing it are

1213
00:51:29,901 --> 00:51:31,880
not necessarily saying they support
trump.

1214
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:36,110
They're saying that their patriotism.
Yeah.

1215
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:37,640
Any of the money.
Toby,

1216
00:51:37,641 --> 00:51:39,500
Keith's supporting trump.
He is.

1217
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:42,920
He came up on stage with a Red Dixie Cup
and cheered him.

1218
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:45,590
Did he did a big cheer.
I swear to God

1219
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:50,630
what?
Jesus Christ is not traditionally

1220
00:51:50,631 --> 00:51:53,330
American enough is sort of the quote
they said.

1221
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:54,740
Who said that?
Who said that?

1222
00:51:54,741 --> 00:51:58,670
Trump's team that that was asked and
Operation Committee.

1223
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,630
Okay.

1224
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:02,360
That Kanya is not American enough so
they,

1225
00:52:02,361 --> 00:52:04,170
that's so ridiculous.

1226
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:05,893
What does that even mean?

1227
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:12,840
Not American enough kid rock.
I'm surprised kid rock didn't do it.

1228
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,530
I was kid rock.
Not on the card.

1229
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,770
I don't know what kind of show you think
this is.

1230
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:21,810
Anyone they can get.
I don't know what it is.

1231
00:52:21,811 --> 00:52:24,300
You guys see this Ted nugent grabbing
his dick at the,

1232
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:26,230
at the trump rally.
Oh,

1233
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,930
he was there.
Have you not seen this video?

1234
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,550
Who's grabbing his dick?
This was at a,

1235
00:52:29,551 --> 00:52:30,061
this was,
no,

1236
00:52:30,061 --> 00:52:31,740
this was up up in Michigan.
Look at.

1237
00:52:31,741 --> 00:52:34,500
This is a great video of Ted nugent.
If you have never seen this

1238
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:39,710
to the player,
get in the asset column.

1239
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:43,020
Finance,
real Michigan,

1240
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:47,430
greatest state in the nation.
They should.

1241
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:50,430
We must not let me get it out.

1242
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:51,760
He's dressed like a fisherman.

1243
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:57,780
Illinois in New York and New Jersey and
Maryland and Massachusetts.

1244
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,380
Blue right here.

1245
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:06,770
Just grabbed his deck and he said I got
him to lose state right here,

1246
00:53:06,771 --> 00:53:08,780
baby.
Hello Ted nugent baby.

1247
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,090
He's very happy.
You're a big noodle fan.

1248
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,590
Love to cat.
Scratch fever.

1249
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:14,840
Yeah,
but dude and strangle hold great fucking

1250
00:53:14,841 --> 00:53:17,360
song.
I got your blue state right here.

1251
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:20,030
It's amazing.
It's somewhat funny or die.

1252
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:20,570
He did,
uh,

1253
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,580
did uh,
did a thing where they kept zooming in

1254
00:53:22,581 --> 00:53:25,170
on him,
grabbing his penis to accentuate like

1255
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,130
the physical hold

1256
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:29,840
of his pain.
He physically grabs it.

1257
00:53:29,841 --> 00:53:33,420
It looks like he's holding onto a
lighter and then the fucking cubs

1258
00:53:33,421 --> 00:53:34,830
punching in,
hot it to show up

1259
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,190
doing it.
When did,

1260
00:53:36,191 --> 00:53:37,420
uh,
when did he do that?

1261
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:39,170
When did that take place?
Was in,

1262
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,530
this was at a rally and I think it's
Michigan.

1263
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,270
Do you have it up there and recently?
Let's see.

1264
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,580
I just got it sent.
It happened there along the campaign

1265
00:53:48,581 --> 00:53:51,820
trail
was a while ago.

1266
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:52,743
Yeah,
it was a while ago.

1267
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:55,450
I was doing a crazy thing.
The victory tour,

1268
00:53:55,451 --> 00:53:58,120
like how do you win the election then go
to the state she wanted we wouldn't you

1269
00:53:58,121 --> 00:54:00,610
go to the states that you lost and see
what they have to say.

1270
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:05,380
This is a different going after snl cast
members.

1271
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,070
That was kind of weird every week,
not just one.

1272
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,090
Alec Baldwin's one thing you would ever
go after.

1273
00:54:10,091 --> 00:54:12,310
I'll let you go then and the cast isn't
funny.

1274
00:54:12,311 --> 00:54:13,420
I was like,
Oh Geez,

1275
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:17,890
23 year old first job.
Now the president saying that only on

1276
00:54:17,891 --> 00:54:20,170
his twitter that I'm not funny.
I think the beauty of it,

1277
00:54:20,171 --> 00:54:22,710
it's just a few months of the finest.
It doesn't have to go to the CAF.

1278
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:25,150
Look.
An snl is benefiting from that.

1279
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:29,780
I think it's fantastic.
It's great for talking to [inaudible].

1280
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,700
No,
that's funny.

1281
00:54:30,701 --> 00:54:33,430
They got me.
He should like make like he was just

1282
00:54:33,431 --> 00:54:34,410
being tough.
Yeah.

1283
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:36,220
Well,
the thing about this country is we love

1284
00:54:36,221 --> 00:54:38,800
it when we hate somebody and then we
liked him again.

1285
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:39,821
Yeah.
You know,

1286
00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:43,660
so all he has to do is that all he has
to do is put out some positive tweets

1287
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:48,610
and be conciliatory and then watched the
country just sweeping them up in there.

1288
00:54:48,611 --> 00:54:50,890
I look at what happened at Bush after
nine 11 yeah,

1289
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:54,730
that's true.
He had the lowest favorable favorability

1290
00:54:54,731 --> 00:54:59,350
rating of any president in history and
after nine 11 he shot up to like 80%

1291
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:00,820
that's right.
I remember that.

1292
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:01,510
Somebody,
they said,

1293
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:02,890
they said trump has the lowest

1294
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:07,050
incoming president elect a approval
rating in the history.

1295
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,940
How do they,
how do they compile that?

1296
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:11,790
That's a very good question.
I've always wondered.

1297
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:12,760
I was like,
how do they compete?

1298
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,700
Oh,
who are they asking exactly?

1299
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,100
I don't know.
I don't know who's taking polls.

1300
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:18,840
People would take polls.
That's what they're doing.

1301
00:55:18,841 --> 00:55:19,411
What?
Well,

1302
00:55:19,411 --> 00:55:22,560
that's like the funniest people that
projected the election to go to a

1303
00:55:22,561 --> 00:55:23,131
hillary.
Well,

1304
00:55:23,131 --> 00:55:24,860
what's interesting is they trust him
anymore.

1305
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,190
They will know,
but they were right.

1306
00:55:26,191 --> 00:55:27,630
If,
if it was a popular vote,

1307
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,310
like they actually were,
right?

1308
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:30,540
Yeah,
it was real.

1309
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:31,470
It's really funny,
like it's,

1310
00:55:31,471 --> 00:55:33,690
it just shows how crazy electoral
college system is,

1311
00:55:33,691 --> 00:55:34,530
but he said,
no,

1312
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:36,390
it should be a popular vote.
He goes,

1313
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:41,250
that's a different race though.
Like he like conceded that it's better

1314
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:42,780
to have it be the popular vote.
He goes,

1315
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:44,650
exactly.

1316
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:48,540
He says that's not the game he goes to
the game is the electoral college vote

1317
00:55:48,541 --> 00:55:50,730
and that's,
that's the game we played and we won by

1318
00:55:50,731 --> 00:55:52,380
a landslide.
Right.

1319
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,930
He's right.
He played it like a game.

1320
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,480
They played it like this thing that
they've been doing over and over and

1321
00:55:57,481 --> 00:56:00,480
over again.
They fucked up in that they,

1322
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:05,540
they rigged it for so long that they,
their popularity contest got taken over

1323
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:10,950
by someone who's actually popular,
like an actual famous person and knows

1324
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:14,130
how to become like,
he knows how to become more popular.

1325
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,750
Do you know what I mean?
Like he understands the,

1326
00:56:15,751 --> 00:56:18,300
some people know the formula of how to
do that.

1327
00:56:18,301 --> 00:56:23,040
He knows how to fucking do it and he's
rich as fuck and he doesn't have to do

1328
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,130
what they want him to do.

1329
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,420
Right.
It's different.

1330
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:29,560
She can finance his own campaign.
He gets there,

1331
00:56:29,561 --> 00:56:34,070
he gets pressed by talking mad shit and
getting people to talk about him like

1332
00:56:34,071 --> 00:56:35,530
she knows how to do it.
See,

1333
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:39,550
here's the thing that I'm confused about
is what's the overall vision?

1334
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:43,960
Like what is trump ism like if you think
about democratic,

1335
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:47,120
what's trump craddick it's a good
question.

1336
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:50,630
Small government.
Well,

1337
00:56:50,631 --> 00:56:51,930
I mean I think it's,
I think the tea,

1338
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:57,010
I mean his truths are to to make sure
taxes are low for people that are

1339
00:56:57,321 --> 00:57:01,850
earning a lot so he can,
those people can stabilize that market

1340
00:57:01,851 --> 00:57:03,230
that they're already in.
You know what I mean?

1341
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,090
That people don't have to sacrifice at
the top.

1342
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,200
I think he's pretty clear about that and
he's little.

1343
00:57:07,201 --> 00:57:08,930
He lowered,
he wants to lower the fuck out of

1344
00:57:08,931 --> 00:57:11,000
business tax.
He wants that to go see the low.

1345
00:57:11,001 --> 00:57:14,990
So He's saying zero government let these
people fucking govern themselves.

1346
00:57:14,991 --> 00:57:18,050
Let small businesses,
that's his whole campaign is to keep

1347
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,050
money up top where it is the fucking
let,

1348
00:57:21,051 --> 00:57:21,410
let,
let,

1349
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:23,300
let pockets that are pretty fixed day
thick.

1350
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,490
I mean I don't,
I think he's pretty transparent about

1351
00:57:25,491 --> 00:57:27,080
that.
That seems to be a thing that he's

1352
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:31,130
pretty obvious about.
I think he wants the rich stay rich and

1353
00:57:31,131 --> 00:57:34,240
he's not afraid of saying it and for
some reason people that are poor,

1354
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,950
like I like it.
Yeah.

1355
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,890
I like what he's going for.
It's,

1356
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,200
that's,
it's crazy.

1357
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,570
Yeah.
It's going to be very,

1358
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,630
very interesting.
I'm really curious to see how this plays

1359
00:57:45,631 --> 00:57:47,010
a Hubbell.
Oh,

1360
00:57:47,011 --> 00:57:49,560
it's going to be interesting.
There's no doubt about that.

1361
00:57:49,561 --> 00:57:51,900
I mean,
it's like any other time when I'm not

1362
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:54,800
happy about what's going on politically.
I just put my head in the sand for a

1363
00:57:54,801 --> 00:57:57,450
while and I go,
I'll just check in and a few months,

1364
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:01,770
but I cannot stop reading on my phone in
the papers.

1365
00:58:01,771 --> 00:58:05,670
Like this is like we're living through a
part of history that's probably more

1366
00:58:05,671 --> 00:58:09,390
turbulent than any other historic,
any other presidential transition.

1367
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:12,090
Do you think this is for Johnson and
Kennedy?

1368
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:14,450
This is like a big metaphorical
question,

1369
00:58:14,451 --> 00:58:16,820
but because of the,
like Obama lived through the age of like

1370
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:19,640
the bursting of the Internet space and
the,

1371
00:58:19,641 --> 00:58:22,940
and its involvement in politics,
you know of like twitter and instagram

1372
00:58:22,941 --> 00:58:23,580
and all this shit.
Shit,

1373
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:26,060
this was bigger.
This is even bigger than that.

1374
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:31,070
It gives midlife breakdown right now.
This is it bottoming out halfway.

1375
00:58:31,501 --> 00:58:34,400
This is the halfway point.
We got another two I think.

1376
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:37,650
I think,
I think trump is president for 20 years

1377
00:58:37,651 --> 00:58:40,590
or three days or it's like something
terrible.

1378
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:41,750
But do you think,
but do you think,

1379
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,640
worry about something terrible?
Sorry to interrupt you because,

1380
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:49,670
because I think he had a real control
over his message in America.

1381
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,220
You know,
he has friends who own the tabloids,

1382
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,410
remember Asanas.
I remember flying with them.

1383
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,670
Nevermind.
But it's like,

1384
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,190
no fuck you go back.
You can't see mind.

1385
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:06,330
My best friend's own tabloids.
Wow.

1386
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:07,650
You know,
and,

1387
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:12,660
and those are his boys.
It's like the [inaudible] family.

1388
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:15,600
They had all the bad stories locked up.
But now when it starts happening in

1389
00:59:15,601 --> 00:59:18,480
Russia and stuff,
he doesn't have quite the old on it.

1390
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,040
People can really get to and

1391
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:22,970
then,
you know,

1392
00:59:22,971 --> 00:59:24,320
he's not young.
Yeah.

1393
00:59:24,321 --> 00:59:26,870
I worry about something bad happened.
It may not end well for him.

1394
00:59:26,871 --> 00:59:28,730
You know,
it's really a tricky one.

1395
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,730
The mother part of me says get fine
because you're going to be around for

1396
00:59:31,731 --> 00:59:32,564
the rest of my life.

1397
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:36,870
The Glenn Greenwald thing is an
interesting angle though cause Glenn

1398
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:39,120
Greenwald is a really respected
journalist.

1399
00:59:39,121 --> 00:59:43,920
He's the guy who exposed wiki leaks.
He's a guy who a lot of people go to and

1400
00:59:43,921 --> 00:59:47,430
he's not without his criticisms.
I mean a lot of people criticize.

1401
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,273
I'm like,
uh,

1402
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:51,000
he's had this ongoing feud is Sam
Harris.

1403
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,860
Um,
but if you,

1404
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:56,160
you look at like what he's,
what he's talking about here,

1405
00:59:56,190 --> 01:00:01,190
if there's any shred of truth to it that
you're seeing like this old institution

1406
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:06,180
attack this new coming incoming guy and
do it in a foolish way that actually

1407
01:00:06,181 --> 01:00:10,320
kind of strengthens this,
this disbelief that people have in the

1408
01:00:10,321 --> 01:00:12,600
news.
Like if they make up some crazy story

1409
01:00:12,601 --> 01:00:15,810
and you hear CNN talking about it and
all these other people talking about it

1410
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:20,070
and substantiated reports that involved
lewd activities and golden showers,

1411
01:00:20,071 --> 01:00:23,720
like who the fuck is doing this?
Like who's doing this?

1412
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:26,580
Like what are you trying to do?
Because by doing this,

1413
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:30,660
especially when it looks obvious and
dumb like that did it makes his case

1414
01:00:30,661 --> 01:00:33,000
look stronger.
It's almost like something that he would

1415
01:00:33,001 --> 01:00:37,680
do to attack himself.
Like that's like how nero burned Rome,

1416
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:38,750
you know?
Like do you,

1417
01:00:38,751 --> 01:00:41,640
you might do something like that.
Attack yourself so that you'll look

1418
01:00:41,641 --> 01:00:42,474
vulnerable.

1419
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:43,720
Do you think he did?
No,

1420
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:44,320
no,
no.

1421
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:47,120
I don't know what he's a great ad is a
counterpoint.

1422
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:50,460
I've been living in New York City during
his entire reign of popularity.

1423
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:54,300
He's a great counter puncher,
so if something happens,

1424
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:57,850
even if you perceive it as bad for him,
he knows how to work that.

1425
01:00:57,851 --> 01:01:02,490
That's what he talked about with Kanye
west and I talking about Kanye do that

1426
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:05,430
every time a really a friend would say,
oh boy,

1427
01:01:05,431 --> 01:01:07,980
this is going to really going to sink
when I go watch.

1428
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:10,560
I go nuts.
You can't run a country like that.

1429
01:01:10,561 --> 01:01:12,510
You can,
you can win an office but you can't.

1430
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:15,840
Who knows?
He knows what he's going to do.

1431
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:18,080
I'm just super,
he doesn't probably,

1432
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:19,770
he probably knows but we don't know

1433
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:21,490
deal,
you know,

1434
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:23,620
if you're,
if you're right about saying that he's

1435
01:01:23,621 --> 01:01:25,960
never going to leave,
then obviously that's going to become a

1436
01:01:25,961 --> 01:01:29,140
problem.
But if you're not right about it and he

1437
01:01:29,141 --> 01:01:34,141
does manage to show some flaws in the
system and expose them,

1438
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,160
then it could be be great.
Sure.

1439
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,510
Maybe,
maybe no one else is going to do it

1440
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:41,160
other than Bernie.
If Bernie won and obviously they were

1441
01:01:41,161 --> 01:01:43,800
conspiring to t Bernie out,
but if Bernie won,

1442
01:01:43,801 --> 01:01:47,880
we could have seen some really weird
changes in the system and and overall

1443
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:48,990
like a,
he's a,

1444
01:01:48,991 --> 01:01:51,120
he was a,
he would be a mood shifter.

1445
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:56,070
Like Bernie would be a guy that is like,
that's kind of what a lot of people

1446
01:01:56,071 --> 01:01:58,140
looking for.
Someone who is not money oriented.

1447
01:01:58,141 --> 01:02:01,530
Someone who is like for the people,
someone who lives a fairly simple life

1448
01:02:01,531 --> 01:02:02,364
for a guy like that

1449
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:05,540
pope when the pope got in you were like,
oh he cares about the,

1450
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:07,910
it was like the pope.
They became friends,

1451
01:02:07,911 --> 01:02:08,540
the whole thing.

1452
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:10,880
Yeah.
Like the pope got rid of that throne.

1453
01:02:10,881 --> 01:02:14,650
He went with a more casual dress.
Yeah.

1454
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:18,770
It's in a lot of ways like what Bernie
would have represented I think is

1455
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:20,010
someone who's

1456
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:25,040
not of the same cloth as we're used to.
We want someone who was like concerned

1457
01:02:25,471 --> 01:02:28,500
about equality across the up above.
Yeah.

1458
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,060
And like broke.
Yes.

1459
01:02:30,061 --> 01:02:31,440
Sorry.
Now let's say you're right.

1460
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:34,050
No,
just and this and then so fed of the guy

1461
01:02:34,051 --> 01:02:36,780
should are there,
the woman who should or could have,

1462
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:39,360
you know,
they're fighting of the wrong game all

1463
01:02:39,361 --> 01:02:40,260
the time.
You know,

1464
01:02:40,261 --> 01:02:42,360
Hillary,
it was probably a great smart person

1465
01:02:42,361 --> 01:02:44,190
and,
but you know,

1466
01:02:44,191 --> 01:02:46,680
you drift into distractions and she's
trying to,

1467
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,690
well this is also the,
something weird happens like the why and

1468
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:55,560
wiring goes haywire and the guy who's
the most popular at something completely

1469
01:02:55,561 --> 01:02:57,660
different gets in there on a freak of
nature.

1470
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:00,990
I mean this country has gone through in
50 years,

1471
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:04,410
you cannot set amusing.
Definitely amusing.

1472
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:08,640
There's a little part of glee in your
heart where it goes,

1473
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:11,790
what the supreme court was.

1474
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:15,930
It's like seeing the whole thing fell as
comedians.

1475
01:03:15,931 --> 01:03:16,531
It's,
you know,

1476
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:19,830
I live long and we all have everything
kind of talk about for the next four

1477
01:03:19,831 --> 01:03:21,960
years.
It made everyone's life a lot more

1478
01:03:21,961 --> 01:03:24,630
interesting all of a sudden.
But don't you think that there's a

1479
01:03:24,631 --> 01:03:27,450
certain amount of intimidation about
criticizing him?

1480
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:28,950
Yeah.
Like there's,

1481
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:31,190
there's some real intimidation that
comes from,

1482
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:34,680
he's a legitimate powerful man.
Do you want to be on his enemies?

1483
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:37,290
No.
It'd be horrible.

1484
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:41,970
And everybody said it feels like that.
And with great power comes great

1485
01:03:41,971 --> 01:03:43,920
responsibility.
And that's one of the things that people

1486
01:03:43,921 --> 01:03:47,490
were really terrified of with a guy like
that because he's got so much power and

1487
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:50,040
so much influence.
He didn't used to,

1488
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:52,470
he was a joke in a weird way to a lot of
people,

1489
01:03:52,471 --> 01:03:55,920
but I always knew that he could actually
do things like when you see him in New

1490
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:56,401
York,
you go,

1491
01:03:56,401 --> 01:03:58,080
all of a sudden you're like,
Holy Shit,

1492
01:03:58,110 --> 01:04:00,570
there's a tower.
There was not there.

1493
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:03,360
He's,
people think he's willy nilly like

1494
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:08,100
shooting from the hip.
He's patient built buildings.

1495
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:09,630
That's different.

1496
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:10,980
I was,
when I grew up in New York,

1497
01:04:10,981 --> 01:04:12,150
he was,
you know,

1498
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:14,790
w when he was a celebrity in New York
and not the country.

1499
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:16,410
He was just a slum Lord.
That's,

1500
01:04:16,411 --> 01:04:18,930
that's sad.
We talked about it and my family,

1501
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:20,970
you know,
they was just a guy who was a guy who

1502
01:04:20,971 --> 01:04:22,290
had suits against him.
He owned,

1503
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:25,650
he owned projects when,
and it was pretty well known back then

1504
01:04:25,651 --> 01:04:26,730
that he was a slum Lord.

1505
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:29,030
Yeah,
twitter is a hobby for him.

1506
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:33,560
I think building is his occupation and
it's a really hard thing to do.

1507
01:04:33,561 --> 01:04:34,780
I remember the,
the,

1508
01:04:34,781 --> 01:04:38,540
the skating rink popping up and he was
always talking about taking over a

1509
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:42,260
squashed of land in New York when you
were lucky to get a little apartment

1510
01:04:42,261 --> 01:04:43,820
somewhere.
This guy who's going to buy like the

1511
01:04:43,821 --> 01:04:45,650
whole,
where the trains where there's some ways

1512
01:04:45,651 --> 01:04:48,860
you have to be like you,
you are to all of that.

1513
01:04:48,861 --> 01:04:51,380
You couldn't help.
But even if he didn't and his politics

1514
01:04:51,381 --> 01:04:54,470
didn't emerge until much later,
you could just kind of kept the cool and

1515
01:04:54,471 --> 01:04:59,471
it was just like a playboy and you know,
a personality and you know,

1516
01:05:00,711 --> 01:05:04,760
it was like a kick to see him around.
He always loved a good joke,

1517
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,620
you know,
he was generous so I get it a lot

1518
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:12,560
easier.
A lot of them not surprised some of the

1519
01:05:12,561 --> 01:05:15,800
smartest,
most successful people I know in New

1520
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:19,000
York supported them.
Do you think though that at the level of

1521
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:23,650
responsibility that you have when you
become the president and the amount of

1522
01:05:23,651 --> 01:05:27,430
power that you have,
do you think that anybody can really

1523
01:05:27,431 --> 01:05:29,670
manage that correctly?
Well,

1524
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:31,600
let's fix it.
What's your take on this position?

1525
01:05:31,601 --> 01:05:34,330
And this,
one of the things is it's exposing this,

1526
01:05:34,331 --> 01:05:39,010
this is exposing how ridiculous the
position is that you could get someone

1527
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:43,090
who's just this one popular person.
It gets into place and run this entire

1528
01:05:43,091 --> 01:05:46,150
thing.
Like what one person running anything.

1529
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:46,850
It's crazy.

1530
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:49,820
Well are we overstating the president?
Really runs,

1531
01:05:49,850 --> 01:05:51,170
look what he's doing.
No,

1532
01:05:51,171 --> 01:05:54,260
but I'm saying once you're in office,
do you think president has as much

1533
01:05:54,261 --> 01:05:54,750
power?

1534
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:57,480
People were going to find out,
we're going to find out what kind of

1535
01:05:57,481 --> 01:05:59,190
power he has.
Cause look who look what he's doing.

1536
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,630
What could we be talking about with the
press corps?

1537
01:06:00,631 --> 01:06:03,250
Look where you're talking about with get
power.

1538
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:04,370
You security.
That's,

1539
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:07,950
yeah,
he's accumulating leverage and power.

1540
01:06:07,951 --> 01:06:09,830
And,
and by putting people around him

1541
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:14,130
operate without his family,
he's always going to have his family

1542
01:06:14,131 --> 01:06:17,010
around.
It's like you don't just suddenly Tello

1543
01:06:17,011 --> 01:06:21,930
indycar driver tomorrow you're driving a
nascar like he's been doing it a certain

1544
01:06:21,931 --> 01:06:22,760
way.

1545
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:23,300
Yeah.
But his,

1546
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:25,820
uh,
his son and his daughter or his series

1547
01:06:25,821 --> 01:06:30,500
two sons,
they can't advise them on policy because

1548
01:06:30,501 --> 01:06:32,570
they're running is a companies.
They have to,

1549
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,980
they have to never have a conversation
with him again about the businesses or

1550
01:06:36,981 --> 01:06:39,230
politics.
Come on like,

1551
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:41,330
come on.
That sounds so ridiculous.

1552
01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:43,400
There's no fucking,
I mean there's just no fucking way,

1553
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,430
but even if they still,
even if that's how it is,

1554
01:06:45,431 --> 01:06:50,410
it's still as family,
but you know what year did they won't

1555
01:06:50,411 --> 01:06:53,560
want to talk to him about it.
He got it.

1556
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,470
He's going to be the richest guy in
history.

1557
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:59,970
It's going to be,
they say that poop mythical figure here

1558
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:01,780
about some oligarch.
They've got arrested.

1559
01:07:01,781 --> 01:07:04,120
It said that gluten's the really strong
history.

1560
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:04,781
No,
dude,

1561
01:07:04,781 --> 01:07:06,760
he's a pause.
I mean he will become,

1562
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:09,760
you're going to bet against it and
become larger than life.

1563
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:11,830
This will make him larger than life.
It'll just be,

1564
01:07:11,831 --> 01:07:13,120
it'll be like a fucking,
it'll,

1565
01:07:13,121 --> 01:07:13,550
we'll be able,

1566
01:07:13,550 --> 01:07:16,400
Beth,
if there is a huge scandal,

1567
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:19,210
it's not going away.
He's got a million kids and family.

1568
01:07:19,211 --> 01:07:21,640
I don't know round for me,
if you think about what's going on in

1569
01:07:21,650 --> 01:07:24,500
the last year,
I guess Kendall make some stronger.

1570
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:28,400
He fucking,
Billy Bush got fucking trampled on the

1571
01:07:28,401 --> 01:07:32,210
fucking on the bus thing.
I think it just made him stronger.

1572
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:36,010
Do you think if this whole story about
the Russian prostitutes pissing on him

1573
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:38,300
got corroborated,
do you think it would hurt him?

1574
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:40,610
I read so I read,
someone said that they thought he'd

1575
01:07:40,611 --> 01:07:43,130
fucking started that shit.
I was like,

1576
01:07:43,131 --> 01:07:45,440
that's a fucking interesting angle.
What if he was like,

1577
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:46,870
yeah,
that's what Joe was saying.

1578
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:50,210
Like,
like why not hire you?

1579
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,410
Yeah,
hi.

1580
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:56,350
Well yeah,
I don't think that's the case,

1581
01:07:56,351 --> 01:08:00,070
but I do think that turned out stuff
around pretty good tax or foolish

1582
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:03,310
because they are,
so you've already proven that he's

1583
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,380
Kevlar.
Like do you get the degree?

1584
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:07,480
He got past,
grab the pussy videos,

1585
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:07,980
what did it,

1586
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:09,630
but then,
but then conversely,

1587
01:08:09,631 --> 01:08:11,600
then what?
Then you can't do anything then.

1588
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:13,440
So what,
what's the legitimate thing that you can

1589
01:08:13,441 --> 01:08:15,800
come out about him?
If you present facts,

1590
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:19,430
they get kind of pushed away.
If you present these crazy news stories,

1591
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:21,140
it just fuels the fire.
So what,

1592
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:23,060
what do you do then to,
good question.

1593
01:08:23,061 --> 01:08:25,070
What does the,
what does the opposition do?

1594
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:28,310
Because anything they come up with is
either fake news to him or it's

1595
01:08:28,311 --> 01:08:30,230
something crazy that makes people go
off.

1596
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:31,070
Dude.
How funny was that?

1597
01:08:31,071 --> 01:08:32,650
They pissed on that fucking bed than
Obama.

1598
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:33,493
I mean,
it just becomes a,

1599
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:34,910
then it becomes like a social bit.

1600
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:40,030
The worst thing that could take place is
that people decide while he's in power

1601
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:44,290
that he can't be empower people decide
that there can't be a president anymore.

1602
01:08:44,291 --> 01:08:48,100
We've decided as a nation that we're
going to abolish this and we're going to

1603
01:08:48,101 --> 01:08:52,330
start a whole new system of government.
That is where it should,

1604
01:08:52,331 --> 01:08:53,890
could get really crazy.
I would get crazy.

1605
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,440
That's what Susan Surandon wants.
Does she want that?

1606
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,060
Yeah.
She remember when he was running for

1607
01:08:58,061 --> 01:08:59,080
president,
he said,

1608
01:08:59,081 --> 01:09:01,570
she goes,
maybe trump should win because maybe

1609
01:09:01,571 --> 01:09:03,790
it's time we do have a revolution in the
streets.

1610
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:05,380
Maybe we need to change it.
It's like,

1611
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:06,970
yeah,
that's easy to say where you're on the

1612
01:09:06,971 --> 01:09:10,300
fifth fin of five story Brownstone with
guards.

1613
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:13,290
You know,
not fucking living in the projects there

1614
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:14,110
and ready to leave

1615
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:18,040
for rich person to say that a poor
person has nothing to lose him would

1616
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:20,470
call for revolution.
But when a rich person does it,

1617
01:09:20,471 --> 01:09:24,850
I think she's got some,
or did you think they become it for her

1618
01:09:24,851 --> 01:09:26,080
first?
Probably.

1619
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:27,610
Yeah.
When I talked to trump,

1620
01:09:27,611 --> 01:09:28,960
somebody said,
how'd you do that?

1621
01:09:28,961 --> 01:09:30,640
He's like,
he's like Hitler.

1622
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:31,720
I go,
if he's Hitler,

1623
01:09:31,721 --> 01:09:35,140
you'll be glad I'm friends with them
because otherwise I can give it up.

1624
01:09:35,141 --> 01:09:40,141
Your fucking moves is in home address.
Well,

1625
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:43,090
it's,
it's bizarre too because he's actually

1626
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:46,480
like publicly supportive Putin,
you know,

1627
01:09:46,481 --> 01:09:48,930
and he talks about Putin being a smart
businessman.

1628
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:51,910
So He's talks with whoever he's been
friends with,

1629
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:55,440
talent,
money be taken away from it.

1630
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,430
A surprise.
He'll figure all that out.

1631
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:00,100
But he can't pretend that these aren't
as pals.

1632
01:10:00,101 --> 01:10:04,600
And if you meet somebody famous once or
twice and they're nice to you,

1633
01:10:05,710 --> 01:10:09,580
that's all he's plus.
He's his stuff's deep.

1634
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:11,080
You know,
he would go over there,

1635
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:14,380
he would bring tv shows,
they're all that stuff is where a

1636
01:10:14,381 --> 01:10:15,430
client,
he's,

1637
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:17,340
we're another,
uh,

1638
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:22,120
um,
piece of commerce in his portfolio of

1639
01:10:22,121 --> 01:10:24,640
how he does business.
So he picks up the phone and he knows

1640
01:10:24,641 --> 01:10:26,710
some guy in Japan,
of course he's going to mention his

1641
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:29,280
properties and that's how he gets going.

1642
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:35,440
What does that works
really well?

1643
01:10:35,441 --> 01:10:36,910
That's what it,
that's a better system.

1644
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:40,140
Yeah.
Putin used government and a private

1645
01:10:40,141 --> 01:10:42,600
ownership to amass fortunes,

1646
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:45,490
but he didn't get his friends fortunes.
But it's kind of,

1647
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:50,080
it's almost going to take something like
this to make people realize that this is

1648
01:10:50,081 --> 01:10:51,640
a ridiculous system.
I mean,

1649
01:10:51,641 --> 01:10:53,860
otherwise we would never figure it out.
We just still look for a better and

1650
01:10:53,861 --> 01:10:57,220
better version of the impossible.
Maybe we're all looking at it wrong.

1651
01:10:57,221 --> 01:10:58,540
It's such,
should we've tested it?

1652
01:10:58,541 --> 01:11:01,420
Anybody can become president.
Well,

1653
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:03,400
maybe it is a good system because it's
got,

1654
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:05,440
yeah,
it's got that and it's got all the

1655
01:11:05,441 --> 01:11:07,750
checks and balances in place.
You know,

1656
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:10,330
I mean,
maybe it is a good system because of all

1657
01:11:10,331 --> 01:11:14,490
the bureaucracy,
something beyond on what's right and

1658
01:11:14,491 --> 01:11:16,170
wrong.
And I've heard that argument.

1659
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:19,080
Dynasty is not the right thing.
So it's time for,

1660
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,710
you know,
civilization had a great run.

1661
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:23,544
What else you got?

1662
01:11:24,370 --> 01:11:27,820
Well,
what's crazy is as dark as it can plug

1663
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:31,320
in.
How much is he?

1664
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:33,310
Here's the thing,
because there are wars going on,

1665
01:11:33,311 --> 01:11:36,670
right?
There's wars going on right now and we

1666
01:11:36,671 --> 01:11:39,850
will always say,
welcome waitress down here.

1667
01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:41,530
The fucking,
the board is going on.

1668
01:11:41,531 --> 01:11:44,800
No drank,
but there's wars going on right now,

1669
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:46,480
but they're just not going on right
here.

1670
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,060
I like,
are we just naive or we naive to not

1671
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,170
understand the danger?

1672
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,710
I think it's my,
it might be coming.

1673
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,113
Yeah.
And you're like,

1674
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:55,260
oh yeah,
it is.

1675
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:56,900
Yeah.
What,

1676
01:11:56,901 --> 01:11:58,410
what would,
what would stop?

1677
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:01,290
What would stop it at this point,
dude,

1678
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:04,100
I don't think I,
I don't think any war with Russia is on

1679
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:05,740
a lot of barriers.
No,

1680
01:12:05,770 --> 01:12:06,181
no,
no,

1681
01:12:06,181 --> 01:12:06,481
no,
no,

1682
01:12:06,481 --> 01:12:07,314
no.

1683
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:09,620
France or Germany,
no.

1684
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:13,270
Why would we go to war with Germany or
France or anyone thinks is possible

1685
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:17,470
leaking.
Well also date what you define cyber

1686
01:12:17,471 --> 01:12:19,990
warfare is is is what it's all about.
I mean,

1687
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:24,700
if we had natural boundaries before,
but now you see that they can hack into

1688
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:28,270
the FBI and the CIA and fucking,
you know,

1689
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:32,350
it was a no one unknown now and this,
you know,

1690
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:35,430
to presume anything.
It's true.

1691
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,810
It's true.
Yeah.

1692
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:39,600
Okay.
Here's,

1693
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:43,630
here's a scenario.
What would it be so crazy ideal way

1694
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:47,670
outside of a dictator.
What would be the ideal way to run a

1695
01:12:47,671 --> 01:12:48,910
nation?
Like whoa,

1696
01:12:48,950 --> 01:12:53,070
what would be better than having this
one alpha that we keep putting in place?

1697
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:56,140
Which seems pretty ridiculous at this
point.

1698
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:58,980
It seems like we might have fucked up
and got a super alpha in there.

1699
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,780
Well,
I don't think that the framers of the

1700
01:13:01,781 --> 01:13:04,660
constitution didn't see the presidency
as being such a big deal.

1701
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:07,210
He was like,
he was kind of a lead administrator,

1702
01:13:07,211 --> 01:13:11,140
but he wasn't supposed to be a be all
end all the power in this country.

1703
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:15,160
And I think we probably want to ratchet
that position down.

1704
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:16,840
Guy that they didn't give it to them.

1705
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:23,480
This is not even that cool of a thing.
It's a weekend.

1706
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,460
Right.
You don't want to be just a baby

1707
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,290
photo out drawing,
sketch jobs,

1708
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,680
kind of photo ops.
They head back.

1709
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:43,520
No,
I was kind of a pragmatist about it.

1710
01:13:43,521 --> 01:13:46,760
I wasn't a supporter of anybody except
uh,

1711
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:49,700
um,
I'm pretty much,

1712
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:55,270
I was against trump winning,
so anybody but trump type of thing.

1713
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:56,701
Right.
Yeah.

1714
01:13:56,701 --> 01:13:59,270
So I'd love to say like,
my wife has a big Bernie supporter.

1715
01:13:59,271 --> 01:14:01,280
I would like to say I was,
but I think I was just,

1716
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:05,040
I was betting on the best horse,
but I thought was the best because

1717
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:07,880
actually you didn't even make the bet,
but you were hope you had a horse in

1718
01:14:07,881 --> 01:14:08,714
mind.
Yeah.

1719
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,490
And it didn't win.
That's what it was like.

1720
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:11,353
Well,
but you lose it.

1721
01:14:11,490 --> 01:14:11,930
Yeah.
I mean,

1722
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:14,420
I can't sit here and say for all the bad
things I say about trump,

1723
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:17,660
I can't sit here and tell you that I was
passionate about hillary or that I even

1724
01:14:17,661 --> 01:14:18,710
like her,
you know?

1725
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:22,400
I just saw it as the lesser two evils.
Yeah.

1726
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,880
You saw her as business as usual,
not business way worse.

1727
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:27,110
Yeah.
Yeah,

1728
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:27,621
it,
it,

1729
01:14:27,621 --> 01:14:32,550
it seemed like it was just another thing
to sell like a woman president.

1730
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:33,450
Huge.
Great.

1731
01:14:34,110 --> 01:14:36,390
Has this,
has the relationships that exist that we

1732
01:14:36,391 --> 01:14:37,440
already know.
So you're like,

1733
01:14:37,441 --> 01:14:39,000
okay.
It was almost like,

1734
01:14:39,390 --> 01:14:40,290
yeah,
but the next,

1735
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:42,180
the assistant coach has been there for a
while.

1736
01:14:42,181 --> 01:14:42,720
Just,
yeah.

1737
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,370
Do that.
Like that's what it felt like in my

1738
01:14:44,371 --> 01:14:49,371
brain that was going to happen.
But I gotta say I was shooting at night

1739
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:52,410
that people were watching it and of
course we're here in Los Angeles,

1740
01:14:52,411 --> 01:14:57,060
like fucking not one of those crew
members isn't hardcore left and watch

1741
01:14:57,061 --> 01:15:01,440
people watching it on their phones and
like their reactions were like complete

1742
01:15:01,441 --> 01:15:03,150
confusion.
It was crazy to watch from this

1743
01:15:03,151 --> 01:15:07,290
perspective and I wonder what it was
like watching from like Michigan.

1744
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:09,930
Do you know what I mean?
And I did a live podcast.

1745
01:15:09,990 --> 01:15:11,070
Oh yeah.
That was crazy.

1746
01:15:11,071 --> 01:15:13,740
Yeah.
We did a live podcast with a bur and

1747
01:15:13,741 --> 01:15:16,340
stan hope and burt crow a shot on
youtube after it.

1748
01:15:16,341 --> 01:15:17,220
That's right.
I saw that.

1749
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:19,580
Hey Os and it's just so strong

1750
01:15:20,670 --> 01:15:23,160
gambling crazy.
Well cause first of all their fucking

1751
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,340
facet joints around the whole time.
And I was looking,

1752
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:28,040
I thought this is a celebration party.
Yeah,

1753
01:15:28,041 --> 01:15:28,730
why not?
Yeah.

1754
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:32,990
They realize that was going to go into
the most confusing moment of my life and

1755
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:36,470
I just failed like it was going to
trump.

1756
01:15:36,471 --> 01:15:40,670
I just like all of a sudden I looked up
at Joe's fucking laughing and Stan hope

1757
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:44,360
is carrying on.
I'm like this nothing funny anymore

1758
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:47,270
sober.
And I just went and I sat in my car in

1759
01:15:47,271 --> 01:15:49,130
front of my house for like two hours.

1760
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:52,550
Oh yeah.
Jesus Christ to your bum me out.

1761
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:54,230
I don't listen.
We were having fun.

1762
01:15:54,231 --> 01:15:56,810
How you where you guys were having fun?
We were just,

1763
01:15:56,870 --> 01:15:58,820
it was just bird killing.
Yeah.

1764
01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:00,540
For like four hours.
He was,

1765
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,300
he was on fire that night.
Fire,

1766
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:05,270
fire.
And then when we became legal and bird

1767
01:16:05,271 --> 01:16:06,410
took a hit.
Yeah,

1768
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,780
he doesn't smoke pot.
He went right in there.

1769
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:12,740
It was the whole fucking room.
Somebody came out with Bert Kreischer I

1770
01:16:12,741 --> 01:16:15,980
think came from the back and he
announced that pot was now legal in

1771
01:16:15,981 --> 01:16:20,180
California and three out of four people
in the audience immediately lit up and

1772
01:16:20,181 --> 01:16:24,530
there was a cloud of smoke that just
took over the rails from the actual

1773
01:16:24,531 --> 01:16:28,760
moment.
Fuck Troy Conrad's took this photo of

1774
01:16:28,761 --> 01:16:30,680
the moment.
Wow.

1775
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:33,650
Burt's running around.
There's always people in the front row

1776
01:16:33,651 --> 01:16:36,080
where I'll go crazy right here.
Everyone's going crazy.

1777
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:40,100
That's the very moment when we found out
that pot was legal in California.

1778
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,460
We're doing a live podcast from the main
room.

1779
01:16:44,210 --> 01:16:46,550
Jeff Ross just walked back yet,
but yeah,

1780
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:49,190
the cut.
The other crazy thing is that doug,

1781
01:16:49,191 --> 01:16:53,870
Stan hopes girlfriend at the time or
still,

1782
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:56,260
but when she was in a coma at that time,
she's not anymore.

1783
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:01,800
Thankfully.
She [inaudible].

1784
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:04,610
We're going to wait to hear what's next
Gen.

1785
01:17:05,150 --> 01:17:06,940
Doug's a fucking trouper man.
Not,

1786
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:08,720
not many people would have power through
right there,

1787
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:09,763
dog.

1788
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:13,880
He's not it.
He's dug stan hope is a special human.

1789
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:16,150
I've known that guy for a long time,
man.

1790
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:17,900
He's fun.
He's the real deal.

1791
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,780
I mean,
he actually did move to Bisbee,

1792
01:17:20,781 --> 01:17:25,781
Arizona and essentially start like a
whole community of Weirdos that live

1793
01:17:25,941 --> 01:17:29,840
down there and hang out and work with
them and do podcasts with them and you

1794
01:17:29,841 --> 01:17:30,830
know,
he,

1795
01:17:30,831 --> 01:17:33,740
and he's kind of using the podcast is
like an open mic.

1796
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:36,770
That's how he rant and that's how he's
coming up with material.

1797
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,470
His whole setup is very interesting,
man.

1798
01:17:39,690 --> 01:17:40,610
It's like,
yeah,

1799
01:17:40,611 --> 01:17:41,390
he's,
yeah,

1800
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:45,380
he's the real deal.
He told you about it or listen to it.

1801
01:17:45,381 --> 01:17:46,040
I've I've,
yeah.

1802
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:48,170
Listen to it a bunch of times as podcast
is awesome,

1803
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:51,470
but he owns like,
he's like a real estate mogul and his

1804
01:17:51,471 --> 01:17:53,050
fucking town.
Yeah,

1805
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:55,630
he owns a bunch of houses,
but houses go up for sale.

1806
01:17:55,630 --> 01:17:59,150
He buys them.
They're all like four grand that he owns

1807
01:17:59,151 --> 01:18:01,460
a ton of time.
He's telling me about it.

1808
01:18:01,490 --> 01:18:04,460
He's fucking bind the town.
He's going to be the trump of Bisbee,

1809
01:18:04,461 --> 01:18:06,950
Arizona.
Doug Sandals.

1810
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,360
God,
I own this town.

1811
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,340
He's going to be like the bad guy and
roadhouse.

1812
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:13,040
Remember the bad guy.
I own this town.

1813
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,160
That's what,
that's what Stan hope's going to do it.

1814
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:16,820
I'll have to dress like him.
I'm telling him,

1815
01:18:16,821 --> 01:18:19,730
I'm thinking about moving there.
Sometimes I think about moving there.

1816
01:18:19,731 --> 01:18:20,541
I'm like,
why not?

1817
01:18:20,541 --> 01:18:23,930
What's fucking join them?
Let's sees seven miles away from Mexico.

1818
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:26,600
If shit gets weird,
you go left,

1819
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:27,980
you go right,
pick your poison.

1820
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:32,150
What do you want to deal with?
Drug cartels are rednecks.

1821
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:34,100
What do you want to know where you want
to go?

1822
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:36,710
Yeah,
he's got a weird spot man.

1823
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:41,000
They see people like when you're,
when you're near the border like that,

1824
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:43,340
you see families coming over.

1825
01:18:43,730 --> 01:18:48,730
Like I've talked to dudes who've been
hunting in Arizona and there's areas

1826
01:18:48,981 --> 01:18:52,440
that they avoid because uh,
too many people are um,

1827
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:54,890
coming over the border and they're their
walk,

1828
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:56,061
you know,
and the,

1829
01:18:56,061 --> 01:18:59,780
the leaving put things on their shoes,
like big chunks of carpet.

1830
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:01,021
Um,
and they,

1831
01:19:01,021 --> 01:19:02,120
uh,
uh,

1832
01:19:02,330 --> 01:19:04,670
timed down to your,
to their shoes so that they don't make

1833
01:19:04,671 --> 01:19:06,470
any footprints.
The hunters,

1834
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:09,890
no Mexican Mexicans coming over from the
border.

1835
01:19:10,210 --> 01:19:13,940
I deal where things on their feet so
that they don't leave obvious tracks.

1836
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:15,470
It's really,
he's like,

1837
01:19:15,471 --> 01:19:18,560
it's crazy.
I know guys that have seen them down

1838
01:19:18,561 --> 01:19:21,590
there and run into him.
It's like a super common thing.

1839
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:25,940
So like there is a trickle of people
that are pretty comfortable cause it'd

1840
01:19:25,941 --> 01:19:27,710
be like,
it would be like running across the

1841
01:19:27,711 --> 01:19:30,950
border on a carpeted area,
high class.

1842
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:31,850
They did it for comfort.

1843
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:34,220
It just so happened to cover a lot of
those folks died.

1844
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:38,120
A lot of those folks could go over and
they get dehydrated and you don't have

1845
01:19:38,121 --> 01:19:40,790
enough water and they,
they get stuck in the desert and you

1846
01:19:40,791 --> 01:19:43,160
know if they tried to come over like in
July and August,

1847
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:46,700
like you could get fucked in era in
southern Arizona.

1848
01:19:46,730 --> 01:19:48,380
Yeah.
If somebody doesn't pick you up,

1849
01:19:48,770 --> 01:19:50,720
you know there's supposed to be someone
to come pick you up.

1850
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:53,900
I mean they have like this whole system
I guess set up how that,

1851
01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:56,420
how they get people over here.
It's Kinda crazy man.

1852
01:19:57,110 --> 01:20:00,950
It's Kinda crazy that we have like this
boundary in the dirt that we decide if

1853
01:20:00,951 --> 01:20:02,630
you're born over there,
you're fucked.

1854
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:04,790
You stay over there,
born over here.

1855
01:20:04,791 --> 01:20:07,140
You're on our team when it's all just
there.

1856
01:20:07,141 --> 01:20:09,360
Just Pete,
if he pulled back from it.

1857
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:12,630
And you look at this connection between
Mexico and the United States,

1858
01:20:12,631 --> 01:20:16,140
it's like it's a landmass.
It's one landmass.

1859
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:18,990
Like Mexico is physically connected to
us.

1860
01:20:18,991 --> 01:20:20,880
It's a part of us.
If we were uh,

1861
01:20:20,881 --> 01:20:22,920
being,
that would be like being at war with our

1862
01:20:22,921 --> 01:20:25,530
foot or not letting our foot come in the
shower,

1863
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:26,520
no,
you can't wash.

1864
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:28,650
I'm going to wash the whole body.
Like this is a,

1865
01:20:28,651 --> 01:20:32,130
this is a part of the entire,
this thing,

1866
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:34,170
you know,
like to break it off into these

1867
01:20:34,171 --> 01:20:38,190
imaginary lines in the sand is no
different than us telling Seattle they

1868
01:20:38,191 --> 01:20:40,010
have to go fuck themselves,
you know,

1869
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:42,000
and no one from Seattle can come over.
It's just,

1870
01:20:42,001 --> 01:20:44,130
it's the same thing.
It's just,

1871
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:44,851
they don't,
you know,

1872
01:20:44,851 --> 01:20:46,740
the obviously aren't under our
constitution,

1873
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:49,020
our laws or any of that stuff,
but they're connected to us.

1874
01:20:49,021 --> 01:20:51,450
There are literally a part of us,
they're right there,

1875
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:53,790
but it's like what you said before about
tribalism.

1876
01:20:53,791 --> 01:20:55,620
It's just so deep,
you know,

1877
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:58,890
it's random and yet it's deep.
Like a sports team.

1878
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,230
It's like any guy can get traded any
given year,

1879
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:03,930
but you're still gonna cheer for that
fucking color uniform.

1880
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:06,960
Even though like a fight,
like the mets in [inaudible] 86,

1881
01:21:06,961 --> 01:21:10,500
after they won the world series,
they fucking traded everybody off and

1882
01:21:10,501 --> 01:21:12,780
they weren't the mets anymore,
but people were still like,

1883
01:21:12,990 --> 01:21:15,150
you know,
wearing the jerseys and cheering.

1884
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,900
Now here's the question.
How do you,

1885
01:21:18,930 --> 01:21:20,700
how do you stop something like that?

1886
01:21:21,740 --> 01:21:23,270
Well,
the hope was globalism.

1887
01:21:23,271 --> 01:21:24,950
Would,
you know that with all of us having

1888
01:21:24,951 --> 01:21:27,410
access to the Internet,
in our pockets with the same as people

1889
01:21:27,411 --> 01:21:28,880
from India,
that they would be this,

1890
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:30,090
you know,
uh,

1891
01:21:30,110 --> 01:21:34,430
you know,
the people had this amazing image of all

1892
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:37,880
the walls falling down and,
but that's not,

1893
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:39,680
hat doesn't seem to be happening.

1894
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:40,810
Do you think?
No,

1895
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:42,160
because I mean,
you're getting,

1896
01:21:42,161 --> 01:21:43,570
we're getting more connected,
but,

1897
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:47,440
but culture means a lot to people and
they're going to keep it and that's,

1898
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:50,860
that's,
that identifies them with who they are.

1899
01:21:50,861 --> 01:21:54,490
So they're never going to get rid of
that and just become super otherwise,

1900
01:21:54,491 --> 01:21:55,001
uh,
you know,

1901
01:21:55,001 --> 01:21:59,170
the westernization of the world would
just be with them all being us.

1902
01:21:59,171 --> 01:21:59,800
I mean,
what would that,

1903
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,780
what's the end to answer?
It's like everyone should be the same,

1904
01:22:01,781 --> 01:22:06,190
but most places you go around the world
that are Westernized,

1905
01:22:06,191 --> 01:22:07,510
quote unquote,
that are globalized.

1906
01:22:07,511 --> 01:22:08,620
It's uh,
it looks like us.

1907
01:22:08,621 --> 01:22:08,920
Hmm.

1908
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:09,611
Yeah.
But I mean,

1909
01:22:09,611 --> 01:22:14,611
we know for a fact that apple goes to
China and pays people pennies and they

1910
01:22:15,221 --> 01:22:18,500
have nets are on the buildings where
these people live and work.

1911
01:22:18,790 --> 01:22:21,400
They have dormitories and they cover
them with nets.

1912
01:22:21,401 --> 01:22:22,870
We know about Foxconn.
We know,

1913
01:22:22,910 --> 01:22:24,550
we know that story,
so we know.

1914
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:29,650
And we still bodies fucking phones.
I didn't even think twice again twice.

1915
01:22:29,830 --> 01:22:32,290
I'm like,
those fucking jumpers make a hell of a

1916
01:22:32,291 --> 01:22:34,030
phone.
Wait,

1917
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,390
wait.
Plus breast,

1918
01:22:36,430 --> 01:22:39,730
a little a $1 an hour hearts or whatever
the fuck they get paid.

1919
01:22:39,731 --> 01:22:43,120
And we accept that and we accept that
not just in China,

1920
01:22:43,121 --> 01:22:48,070
but all throughout South America.
There's a bunch of different factories

1921
01:22:48,190 --> 01:22:52,450
that employ people that pay them pennies
compared to what they would have to pay

1922
01:22:52,451 --> 01:22:55,210
the same person in America.
So he's saying that we care,

1923
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:57,370
we care less about them because they're
not Americans.

1924
01:22:57,370 --> 01:22:58,300
Exactly.
Yeah.

1925
01:22:58,330 --> 01:23:01,660
We literally allow people to give them
slave wages.

1926
01:23:01,661 --> 01:23:03,200
Well,
we would consider slave wage.

1927
01:23:03,201 --> 01:23:08,201
Just like if someone took a guy you and
made you work for 14,000 on that,

1928
01:23:08,771 --> 01:23:11,050
you know the Blah Blah Blah factory that
makes you know,

1929
01:23:11,051 --> 01:23:13,810
fucking jeans or sneakers or wherever
the fuck they make.

1930
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:18,070
If they made you work for that amount,
you would think you were in jail.

1931
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:19,270
He was like,
oh my God,

1932
01:23:19,271 --> 01:23:21,490
I have to live off of this.
These people control me,

1933
01:23:21,491 --> 01:23:22,590
they own me.
They,

1934
01:23:22,610 --> 01:23:26,590
they have paralyzed me with poverty.
Like there's no way I'll ever be able to

1935
01:23:26,591 --> 01:23:29,300
escape this.
And the only argument against it is a

1936
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,270
while.
It's the quality of their life is much

1937
01:23:31,271 --> 01:23:33,010
better than it was before the factory
got there.

1938
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:34,180
You know,
before the factory,

1939
01:23:34,181 --> 01:23:36,460
not there,
nobody made any money at all because

1940
01:23:36,461 --> 01:23:37,990
they were eating coconuts,
mangoes,

1941
01:23:37,991 --> 01:23:40,600
and they were catching fish,
but they didn't need any money.

1942
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:43,870
I you made them work.
There's a lot of these places where

1943
01:23:43,871 --> 01:23:46,930
you're setting up shop,
like they'd been there for thousands and

1944
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:48,520
thousands of years.
It didn't need the factory.

1945
01:23:48,910 --> 01:23:51,130
You know,
it's maybe the factory is nice to them.

1946
01:23:51,131 --> 01:23:52,540
Maybe it is good.
Maybe it does.

1947
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,970
Maybe they do become dependent upon it
over time.

1948
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:59,470
But people have existed everywhere,
all over the planet without factories

1949
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:02,950
for a long fucking time.
You don't need that factory there.

1950
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:06,460
There's a lot of other solutions.
It's not an either or proposition.

1951
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:09,040
Like either the factories there are,
they never get their shit together.

1952
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:10,151
Like,
no,

1953
01:24:10,151 --> 01:24:11,860
that's not the case.
Like if they could,

1954
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:15,010
they could develop their own culture and
society just like the United States did.

1955
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:18,820
But if you just make them in prison to
these factories where they get paid

1956
01:24:18,821 --> 01:24:22,810
slave wages in these foreign third world
countries that we don't care about as

1957
01:24:22,811 --> 01:24:27,040
much as we care about Detroit or we care
about Chicago or were care about places

1958
01:24:27,041 --> 01:24:29,920
that are just like that place connected
to us.

1959
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:34,330
Yeah,
well I'm a Cami or something,

1960
01:24:34,331 --> 01:24:35,170
right?
Jesus.

1961
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:39,850
It's God Damn Kami talk real realist.
It's gross.

1962
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:43,600
The whole thing of not letting those
people over here is gross.

1963
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:46,600
It's you're going to have ended
eventually like when you get to keep it

1964
01:24:46,601 --> 01:24:48,820
like that for a million years,
a million years now we're going to have

1965
01:24:48,821 --> 01:24:52,390
states and you can't cross.
You can't immigrate from Mexico.

1966
01:24:52,450 --> 01:24:54,670
So million years from now,
we're still going to have deep poverty

1967
01:24:54,671 --> 01:24:58,090
in Mexico and we're terrified of the
drug war and leaking over our soil.

1968
01:24:58,120 --> 01:24:59,980
Is that what's going to go on a million
years from now?

1969
01:25:00,010 --> 01:25:00,970
No,
we're going to fucking,

1970
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:04,990
we're going to be one united planet once
super organism that they can read each

1971
01:25:04,991 --> 01:25:07,250
other's mind.
Federation,

1972
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:09,910
a corporation.
This is a corporation.

1973
01:25:10,090 --> 01:25:14,860
This is a hiccup along gigantic trail
that leads from us throwing shit at each

1974
01:25:14,861 --> 01:25:19,300
other from a tree to us being able to
transcend literal space and time,

1975
01:25:19,610 --> 01:25:23,170
become a part of some artificially
created dimension that they establish

1976
01:25:23,470 --> 01:25:25,900
that's,
that's a hundred years from now or 200

1977
01:25:25,901 --> 01:25:27,200
years from now.
This is like a,

1978
01:25:27,230 --> 01:25:29,890
this whole thing we're going through
right now is a blip in time.

1979
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:33,280
And it's also a challenge to how much
technology,

1980
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:35,020
uh,
really connects us.

1981
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:39,850
So it like this guy's going to present a
lot of challenges as to like how much

1982
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:42,220
technology can unite human beings.

1983
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:43,400
Well,
the problem is,

1984
01:25:43,401 --> 01:25:45,440
and you and I were talking earlier
about,

1985
01:25:45,441 --> 01:25:47,000
uh,
what's the law called again?

1986
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:52,220
Moore's law,
Moore's law that every two years this

1987
01:25:52,221 --> 01:25:56,990
speed of computers and the memory of
computers doubles and at that's held

1988
01:25:56,991 --> 01:26:00,170
true since the guy came up with the law,
which was in like 1960.

1989
01:26:00,470 --> 01:26:01,430
That's the neighborhood,
right?

1990
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:03,920
Jamie Moore's law.
And,

1991
01:26:03,930 --> 01:26:04,763
uh,

1992
01:26:05,130 --> 01:26:09,710
and the problem with it is I'm reading
this book right now about it and the

1993
01:26:09,711 --> 01:26:13,340
problem with it is that we can't keep up
culturally,

1994
01:26:13,490 --> 01:26:18,490
emotionally,
legally with how fast information is,

1995
01:26:19,251 --> 01:26:22,040
is a traveling and how,
like you said,

1996
01:26:22,041 --> 01:26:24,620
it's become,
everybody has access to the same

1997
01:26:24,621 --> 01:26:26,540
information,
but it's also just,

1998
01:26:26,870 --> 01:26:29,150
you know,
the ramifications of,

1999
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:32,420
you know,
corporations being able to get into your

2000
01:26:32,570 --> 01:26:35,150
information.
Like we don't have laws in place that

2001
01:26:35,151 --> 01:26:38,870
can really tackle that because it's
happening so fast.

2002
01:26:38,990 --> 01:26:42,110
You look at Airbnb,
we didn't have laws in place for people

2003
01:26:42,111 --> 01:26:46,460
renting out their places,
all paying taxes on using your own car

2004
01:26:46,461 --> 01:26:51,461
to drive people as a taxi.
We're like a one step behind progress

2005
01:26:51,531 --> 01:26:54,950
and we're going to stay that way because
it's happening so fast.

2006
01:26:56,270 --> 01:26:56,960
You know,

2007
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:58,610
I saw a taxi today,
I don't want,

2008
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:00,830
wow,
this is going to be like one of those

2009
01:27:00,831 --> 01:27:02,110
payphones.
Yeah.

2010
01:27:02,810 --> 01:27:04,520
Yeah.
I'm looking at this car,

2011
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:05,510
this guy's drawn.
I'm like,

2012
01:27:05,511 --> 01:27:07,040
this is going to be a payphone.
Duke,

2013
01:27:07,070 --> 01:27:10,510
we're just gonna have prejudices and
they're going to use people who are

2014
01:27:10,511 --> 01:27:11,990
going to take uber.
It's better,

2015
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:15,600
you know,
happening in big cities is uber sort of

2016
01:27:15,601 --> 01:27:19,100
replacing the cabs,
making it tough for cabs and probably

2017
01:27:19,101 --> 01:27:23,720
buses and the private limo.
Certainly now it's starting to cut into

2018
01:27:23,930 --> 01:27:27,500
cars.
People are not needing a car in major

2019
01:27:27,501 --> 01:27:31,550
cities in La and it's cuts out all that
drinking and driving shit.

2020
01:27:32,030 --> 01:27:35,060
I watched somebody slam into a fucking
barrier last night.

2021
01:27:35,490 --> 01:27:36,650
Yeah,
yeah.

2022
01:27:36,651 --> 01:27:39,530
I was driving home last night and there
was this guy driving home from the ice

2023
01:27:39,531 --> 01:27:43,700
house cause this guy to the left to me
and he was speeding and he was a flying

2024
01:27:43,701 --> 01:27:46,610
by me man and he was losing control of
his car a little bit,

2025
01:27:46,850 --> 01:27:49,010
just a little bit like it was just like,
you know,

2026
01:27:49,070 --> 01:27:51,050
he was just wiggling a little,
it was wet.

2027
01:27:51,070 --> 01:27:53,000
The,
the roads were wet and uh,

2028
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:56,990
this guy was just driving way too fast.
He's probably hydroplaning and a,

2029
01:27:56,991 --> 01:27:59,720
I said this guy is just not keeping it
together good.

2030
01:27:59,721 --> 01:28:01,160
He might be trunk or whatever.
Swipe,

2031
01:28:01,161 --> 01:28:05,210
pull over two lanes.
I give them some space and a minute

2032
01:28:05,211 --> 01:28:08,330
after I do that bang hits the fucking
side.

2033
01:28:08,331 --> 01:28:12,050
The cement barrier spins out.
Correct.

2034
01:28:12,051 --> 01:28:14,780
Spins again,
fucked his car up.

2035
01:28:14,890 --> 01:28:17,240
No Shit.
Why you come to a stand still in the

2036
01:28:17,241 --> 01:28:19,580
middle of the highway came to a stop in
the left lane.

2037
01:28:19,850 --> 01:28:21,680
Yeah,
to turn in the right direction.

2038
01:28:21,681 --> 01:28:25,040
Fortunately his car was fucked up for
sure.

2039
01:28:25,041 --> 01:28:28,460
He might not have been able to drive,
but he was at least looking that way.

2040
01:28:28,461 --> 01:28:32,840
Cause sometimes it's wind up sideways
and when you wind up sideways on the

2041
01:28:32,841 --> 01:28:35,570
highway,
you're fucked because not everybody's

2042
01:28:35,571 --> 01:28:38,570
going to see you and it doesn't look
like rear tail light.

2043
01:28:38,570 --> 01:28:41,240
So you're not getting the same kind of
reflection that you get.

2044
01:28:41,241 --> 01:28:43,520
If you saw taillights you put,
the guy was stopped in front of you,

2045
01:28:43,670 --> 01:28:44,600
you saw those taillights,
you,

2046
01:28:44,601 --> 01:28:46,100
you would know,
oh there's a car there.

2047
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:49,880
Like sometimes when people are not
totally paying attention and you,

2048
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:52,550
here's a car that's sideways parked on
the road,

2049
01:28:52,551 --> 01:28:56,420
like dude,
who I watched that happen once.

2050
01:28:56,510 --> 01:28:59,390
I was in um,
New York and I was coming home from a

2051
01:28:59,391 --> 01:29:04,380
Gig with my friend John and uh,
we were driving and there was a car that

2052
01:29:04,381 --> 01:29:08,700
was stopped dead in the left lane and
uh,

2053
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:12,160
it had hazard lights on but the hazard
lights were dying.

2054
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:16,920
There was like super damn,
there was no battery juice and I saw it

2055
01:29:17,070 --> 01:29:21,060
and I changed lanes quick but not that
far away from it.

2056
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:22,800
Like I'm,
I barely missed it.

2057
01:29:22,801 --> 01:29:23,910
I missed it by like,
I dunno,

2058
01:29:23,911 --> 01:29:26,340
50 yards or something like that,
close enough where it was like,

2059
01:29:26,370 --> 01:29:30,120
Holy Shit.
And then I look in my rear view and this

2060
01:29:30,121 --> 01:29:35,121
guy plows into it at full speed and I
see the cars in my rear view as I'm

2061
01:29:35,641 --> 01:29:37,920
driving.
I see them spinning in the rear view

2062
01:29:37,921 --> 01:29:40,050
mirror and I'm realized like,
people are probably dying.

2063
01:29:40,780 --> 01:29:42,870
I'm,
I'm looking at dead people because they

2064
01:29:42,871 --> 01:29:47,680
hit that thing going 70 miles an hour,
just slammed into it and everything's

2065
01:29:47,690 --> 01:29:49,750
spinning stuff.
Visions of,

2066
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:52,140
of a plain car crash.
It's so scary.

2067
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,370
Oh yeah.
I had a guy,

2068
01:29:54,540 --> 01:29:55,373
bad car,
car,

2069
01:29:55,410 --> 01:29:57,990
car accident.
I've been banged around and spin around

2070
01:29:58,170 --> 01:30:01,350
mostly when I was um,
you know,

2071
01:30:01,351 --> 01:30:05,850
old tires as a teenager but not like a
fucking wreck wreck.

2072
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:08,220
I got in a couple of smaller,
not too bad.

2073
01:30:08,221 --> 01:30:10,110
Rex is a comedian,
you know,

2074
01:30:10,111 --> 01:30:11,540
trying to drive.
Yeah.

2075
01:30:11,970 --> 01:30:14,820
Drive like a new drive home in the snow
and shit.

2076
01:30:14,821 --> 01:30:16,980
Cause I didn't want to pay for a hotel.
Dumb stuff.

2077
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:19,830
You know,
I was running late at night and I saw

2078
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:23,400
that car,
there was a really bad car accident a

2079
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:26,040
couple of months,
two months ago on fountain where a girl

2080
01:30:26,041 --> 01:30:29,160
was fucking shit faced.
And people always fly home on fountain

2081
01:30:29,161 --> 01:30:30,060
cause there's,
you know,

2082
01:30:30,090 --> 01:30:30,990
it's,
it's fast.

2083
01:30:30,991 --> 01:30:35,991
There's no lights and a girl must have
clipped a curb and then she headed to

2084
01:30:36,691 --> 01:30:39,540
the other side,
like the fucking other side of the road.

2085
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:44,520
I mean and missed parked cars,
which was insane and smashed into way

2086
01:30:44,670 --> 01:30:47,280
one of those concrete walls on the
corner.

2087
01:30:47,281 --> 01:30:50,070
You know what I mean?
On the apartments have those concrete

2088
01:30:50,071 --> 01:30:51,190
fucking huge,
well,

2089
01:30:51,630 --> 01:30:56,010
I mean it and it looked like a fucking
bulldozer ran into it on 50 you know

2090
01:30:56,011 --> 01:30:58,440
what I mean?
It was like a million pieces.

2091
01:30:58,441 --> 01:31:00,390
I mean there was shit like two blocks
up.

2092
01:31:00,690 --> 01:31:01,860
Who was unfucking rail.

2093
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:04,070
Yeah.
When you see someone really hit

2094
01:31:04,071 --> 01:31:07,880
something with a car,
you realize how crazy car travel is and

2095
01:31:07,881 --> 01:31:10,940
how those autonomous cars are like the
future.

2096
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,680
You're not going to be able to argue
against it.

2097
01:31:12,681 --> 01:31:12,790
Yeah.

2098
01:31:12,790 --> 01:31:14,290
Right.
Because it takes,

2099
01:31:14,291 --> 01:31:15,820
I mean,
we've all been,

2100
01:31:16,150 --> 01:31:17,950
I mean,
I've fallen asleep at the wheel on the

2101
01:31:17,951 --> 01:31:20,530
highway at night ice to drive from
Boston back to New York.

2102
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:24,970
Saturday night I would do two shows.
Then I get my car wherever the fuck I

2103
01:31:24,971 --> 01:31:29,680
was and I would drive to New York that
night and I can remember windows open

2104
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:33,880
singing as loud as I could it just
because I would close my eyes and I

2105
01:31:33,881 --> 01:31:35,800
would fucking wake up on the shoulder
was craig.

2106
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:37,960
I think about how many times I could
have died,

2107
01:31:39,070 --> 01:31:41,500
you know?
And I remember when I was a teenager,

2108
01:31:41,501 --> 01:31:45,700
there was this 69 cougar that I was
going to buy from this kid named Billy

2109
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:48,610
Arduino and it was a muscle car and he
had it fucking jacked up.

2110
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:50,710
It was a motor head and I was going to
buy this.

2111
01:31:51,790 --> 01:31:55,530
Where did you get from Terry town now?
The order windows.

2112
01:31:55,590 --> 01:31:57,800
And so this other kid bought it and

2113
01:31:58,200 --> 01:31:59,740
driving down nine

2114
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:02,860
right in front of the hospital.
It's a two lane road but it goes like 50

2115
01:32:02,861 --> 01:32:04,720
miles an hour.
And a,

2116
01:32:04,721 --> 01:32:09,130
I see the car and it's driving in front
of me and has a light rain and uh,

2117
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:12,580
and I see him,
I don't know what the fuck happened but

2118
01:32:12,581 --> 01:32:16,420
he started going back and forth fish
tail and the fish tail.

2119
01:32:16,421 --> 01:32:19,930
I think he was gunning it cause he saw
me and he was trying to be a bad ass.

2120
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:22,840
Yeah.
When in the opposite lane hit this

2121
01:32:22,841 --> 01:32:27,841
mother and kid no fucking head on.
And to this day I can remember the smell

2122
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:32,650
of burnt rubber and loyal.
Like it happened like right in front of

2123
01:32:32,651 --> 01:32:33,850
me.
And,

2124
01:32:33,851 --> 01:32:36,280
uh,
the woman was hospitalized sometimes.

2125
01:32:36,281 --> 01:32:41,010
Somehow that kid was okay and this fat
fuck just got right out of the car and

2126
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:42,060
then nothing happens.
Yeah,

2127
01:32:42,170 --> 01:32:43,390
yeah.
Like chipped a tooth.

2128
01:32:43,490 --> 01:32:44,750
Yeah.
Yeah.

2129
01:32:44,751 --> 01:32:45,381
When you,
uh,

2130
01:32:45,381 --> 01:32:47,870
you see people drive and really fucked
up man,

2131
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:51,130
there was a,
I pass by this,

2132
01:32:51,131 --> 01:32:53,420
uh,
one of those power boxes,

2133
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:54,350
whatever it is,
you know,

2134
01:32:54,351 --> 01:32:57,200
those things that are on the corner and
it had all these um,

2135
01:32:57,201 --> 01:32:58,600
wreaths on it.
Uh,

2136
01:32:58,660 --> 01:32:59,810
and uh,
all this,

2137
01:32:59,811 --> 01:33:02,150
uh,
in memory of this person.

2138
01:33:02,570 --> 01:33:04,940
And then I looked up the store and it
was two kids.

2139
01:33:05,210 --> 01:33:09,290
They were racing down the road and some
lady pulled out and they clipped the

2140
01:33:09,291 --> 01:33:14,291
lady and spun her car around but didn't
hurt her and went straight into a pole

2141
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:15,673
and just died.

2142
01:33:16,350 --> 01:33:19,720
My best friend's handicapped from doing
the exact same thing at school,

2143
01:33:19,721 --> 01:33:21,680
Buddy.
He was just going to say years with

2144
01:33:21,681 --> 01:33:22,514
them.
Yeah.

2145
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:25,890
Wow.
Derek is oh,

2146
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:27,070
fucking scary.
You know,

2147
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:30,670
and the building of the three guys in
the car walked away being competitive

2148
01:33:30,671 --> 01:33:33,550
like that on this,
on regular streets and racing with

2149
01:33:33,551 --> 01:33:35,080
people.
So fucking dangerous.

2150
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,900
So dangerous.
Just like you see those painted bikes

2151
01:33:37,901 --> 01:33:40,570
that are chained to polls that represent
bikers that died.

2152
01:33:40,571 --> 01:33:41,231
I mean there's a,
Oh,

2153
01:33:41,231 --> 01:33:41,981
is that what that is?
Well,

2154
01:33:41,981 --> 01:33:43,750
La doesn't really have a lot of it in
Chicago.

2155
01:33:43,751 --> 01:33:45,100
It's big.
Where I'm from,

2156
01:33:45,101 --> 01:33:48,760
it's a big thing of like commuter bikes,
passenger bikes and messengers.

2157
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,240
They get hit all the fucking time and
then when they die they spray painted

2158
01:33:52,241 --> 01:33:56,800
white and then they change it to the
pole at the intersection and my mom was

2159
01:33:56,801 --> 01:33:59,680
saying it was like she's fucking,
one year.

2160
01:33:59,681 --> 01:34:02,560
It was almost like every other block she
was driving down to a psych.

2161
01:34:02,561 --> 01:34:04,930
There was another bike.
It's another bike because people are

2162
01:34:04,931 --> 01:34:07,100
fucking drunk as shit.
A fuck clip.

2163
01:34:07,101 --> 01:34:10,300
Some guy that's driving and riding his
bike home from work or some shit.

2164
01:34:10,630 --> 01:34:11,351
Yeah,
it's a,

2165
01:34:11,351 --> 01:34:13,600
it's a commitment to go,
I'm going to ride a motorcycle.

2166
01:34:13,601 --> 01:34:18,601
You got to really buy into it because
your odds of dying just go up

2167
01:34:18,941 --> 01:34:20,590
exponentially from driving a car.

2168
01:34:21,210 --> 01:34:24,630
Odds of dying more.
I'm a bicycle or

2169
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:25,583
motorcycle.

2170
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:32,680
Sorry Dude.
You're right.

2171
01:34:37,580 --> 01:34:39,120
I'm Debbie Downer.
I'm trying to,

2172
01:34:41,780 --> 01:34:44,190
we're looking at,
Joe's got the reigns and he's taken us

2173
01:34:44,191 --> 01:34:49,191
down and we're going to,
I did not meet any correct frying your

2174
01:34:50,070 --> 01:34:52,500
fucking pog cause I be correct in me.
Thank you.

2175
01:34:52,501 --> 01:34:54,650
Let me to cry now.
You're alive.

2176
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:58,340
You're right.
Who needs a couple of days?

2177
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:02,330
I'm not the first card.
The cry in the basement of the comedy

2178
01:35:02,331 --> 01:35:04,220
store.
Oh definitely not.

2179
01:35:05,330 --> 01:35:06,680
Definitely not.
You're probably the first.

2180
01:35:06,681 --> 01:35:08,330
It didn't really do anything horrible
though.

2181
01:35:10,370 --> 01:35:14,390
I came down here
and it brought me down.

2182
01:35:14,391 --> 01:35:16,970
He had this like a back room over there,
which just like storage,

2183
01:35:16,971 --> 01:35:18,380
she in it.
And you know what I found,

2184
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:24,220
I found pauly shore is original script
of in the army now with his acting notes

2185
01:35:25,011 --> 01:35:26,180
to himself.
No.

2186
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:30,710
Like one of them was like be the weezer
weasel,

2187
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:32,690
the weasel feed,
the weezer

2188
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:37,250
be that band.
They got some be raised there,

2189
01:35:37,990 --> 01:35:41,270
but like the whole script he had marked
up the fellows acting nuts.

2190
01:35:41,271 --> 01:35:45,530
Did you I would've taken a fucking try.
Want to take it with you?

2191
01:35:45,890 --> 01:35:46,910
Yeah.
Yeah.

2192
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:52,980
Well there you go.
This place is,

2193
01:35:53,450 --> 01:35:55,550
you know,
one of the most,

2194
01:35:55,610 --> 01:35:56,990
uh,
if you believe in ghosts,

2195
01:35:57,050 --> 01:36:00,350
one of the most notoriously haunted
places in all of California,

2196
01:36:00,530 --> 01:36:03,410
maybe in the country because it used to
be Ciro's nightclubs.

2197
01:36:03,810 --> 01:36:05,440
I still Yakov smirnoff here together.

2198
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:07,410
Ah,

2199

2200
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:15,540
There's the mob killed tonight.

He's just like a curse on.
He's fucking funny man.

2222
01:37:06,490 --> 01:37:07,840
It's going to be,
prayer is one of the most

2223
01:37:07,841 --> 01:37:11,630
underappreciated guys working today.
He's a fucking funny guy.

2224
01:37:11,631 --> 01:37:14,080
He's funny as shit.
So Lawrence holds the belt,

2225
01:37:14,110 --> 01:37:14,943
right?
Yeah.

2226
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:16,510
And does he have,
does he get,

2227
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:19,420
did he get challenged?
I think he's going to challenge whoever

2228
01:37:19,421 --> 01:37:23,140
wins this tournament.
There's so many funny up and coming

2229
01:37:23,141 --> 01:37:27,730
comedians and that is one of the best
places for them to expose or to get

2230
01:37:27,731 --> 01:37:29,860
exposed.
Some of them already barely comedians

2231
01:37:29,861 --> 01:37:31,960
and roast battle and it helps them
figure that out.

2232
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:34,030
Yeah,
they're just starting out your voice

2233
01:37:34,031 --> 01:37:36,520
through this roast jokes and some of
them are like,

2234
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:39,220
we did well.
They did jokes that they,

2235
01:37:39,221 --> 01:37:41,530
right.
I'm fucking blown away every time I sit

2236
01:37:41,531 --> 01:37:42,610
in and judge it.
I'm like,

2237
01:37:42,810 --> 01:37:44,200
how long?
I'll say to them afterwards,

2238
01:37:44,201 --> 01:37:47,020
how long did you write those jokes for?
There'll be like three months.

2239
01:37:47,650 --> 01:37:51,390
Like they literally right from month one
Rose Battle,

2240
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:54,070
two of the roasters told me they have
the bracket up on their wall and they're

2241
01:37:54,071 --> 01:37:56,930
writing ahead in they advance or from
when they advance.

2242
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:59,640
Well,
you guys have always said it's a joke

2243
01:37:59,641 --> 01:38:01,070
writer showcase.
Yeah.

2244
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:01,930
Yeah.

2245
01:38:01,930 --> 01:38:04,030
It's such an important thing in comedy
right now.

2246
01:38:05,230 --> 01:38:06,130
Thank you.
It is,

2247
01:38:06,131 --> 01:38:09,820
dude.
You need to have that world exist for

2248
01:38:09,821 --> 01:38:14,470
people in a world right now where pc and
people on their toes and who knows what

2249
01:38:14,471 --> 01:38:16,810
to say what all the time and that's such
a fucking deal.

2250
01:38:16,811 --> 01:38:21,460
Now I'm so happy that that is still
being represented in the comedy world

2251
01:38:21,790 --> 01:38:25,600
because it fucking lightens everything.
It makes everything,

2252
01:38:26,110 --> 01:38:31,110
all the voices shut the fuck up and
enjoy two people making fun of each

2253
01:38:31,241 --> 01:38:32,050
other.
Yeah.

2254
01:38:32,050 --> 01:38:34,810
It's like the gates,
like the most clean thing that we need

2255
01:38:34,811 --> 01:38:38,410
in an entertainment and especially for
comedy because dude,

2256
01:38:38,411 --> 01:38:42,040
right now I feel like you're on tippy
toes sometimes when you do shows in

2257
01:38:42,041 --> 01:38:43,180
places and you're like,
what do I,

2258
01:38:43,270 --> 01:38:45,170
what can the,
what are these people going to get a no,

2259
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:49,070
you're going to get offended by and,
and that fucking there's,

2260
01:38:49,580 --> 01:38:51,200
well,
what's so weird is that when we were

2261
01:38:51,201 --> 01:38:52,460
coming up,
you know,

2262
01:38:52,461 --> 01:38:56,300
like I know Joe and I were really in a
bill hex and like I didn't necessarily

2263
01:38:56,301 --> 01:38:59,270
agree with everything about his
politics.

2264
01:38:59,271 --> 01:39:02,540
Certainly with kinison.
I didn't believe in any of his politics,

2265
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:06,920
but I fucking loved him.
And now as a comedian,

2266
01:39:07,130 --> 01:39:10,550
the crowd has an expectation that they
have to agree with you.

2267
01:39:10,551 --> 01:39:13,040
Yes.
And that they'll actually yell out if

2268
01:39:13,041 --> 01:39:15,200
they disagree.
It's like that's not an option.

2269
01:39:17,650 --> 01:39:20,610
The last name guys like not funny.
Yeah.

2270
01:39:20,790 --> 01:39:21,660
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2271
01:39:21,661 --> 01:39:23,940
You're going to have that.
And they feel like they have the right

2272
01:39:23,941 --> 01:39:25,860
now because they're so used to
commenting on things.

2273
01:39:26,140 --> 01:39:27,810
Yeah.
So used to comedy on things like social

2274
01:39:27,830 --> 01:39:29,250
media,
you control pencil,

2275
01:39:29,270 --> 01:39:31,080
what it is,
Rosa battery comments.

2276
01:39:31,110 --> 01:39:33,930
We don't troll on the Internet.
We troll to each other's faces.

2277
01:39:33,990 --> 01:39:34,531
Yeah.
Well no,

2278
01:39:34,531 --> 01:39:36,620
that's a different animal look.
Roast battles.

2279
01:39:36,621 --> 01:39:38,820
So beautiful because it's a pure
competition.

2280
01:39:38,821 --> 01:39:39,930
It's like,
you know,

2281
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:45,000
Mike is so doom and then oh shit.
And then here we go counter.

2282
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:48,540
Like it's like you're playing a game,
you know,

2283
01:39:48,541 --> 01:39:51,660
and sometimes the ball goes out of
bounds and sometimes it doesn't work.

2284
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:54,000
At times he hit that,
you know,

2285
01:39:54,460 --> 01:39:56,580
sometimes you fucking smash it right in
their face.

2286
01:39:56,581 --> 01:39:57,690
I mean it really is

2287
01:39:57,880 --> 01:39:59,010
less people.
Amazing.

2288
01:39:59,050 --> 01:40:04,050
And I wouldn't say it's you're more apt
to go to when if you go harder.

2289
01:40:05,050 --> 01:40:06,730
Right.
I mean is that too many people that lose

2290
01:40:06,731 --> 01:40:08,290
by going too far?
Is there?

2291
01:40:08,470 --> 01:40:08,970
No,

2292
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:09,803
no,
never.

2293
01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:12,480
The best ones I've ever seen are people
that just,

2294
01:40:12,481 --> 01:40:14,550
oh,
people are nervous as long as it's

2295
01:40:14,551 --> 01:40:16,890
funny.
But what's really weird is when someone

2296
01:40:16,891 --> 01:40:19,680
goes super mean and it's not funny.
Yeah.

2297
01:40:21,550 --> 01:40:22,670
Yeah Dave.

2298
01:40:22,670 --> 01:40:26,150
And that's beautiful to see.
I love that shit sort of entertaining.

2299
01:40:26,151 --> 01:40:27,080
Yeah,
of course.

2300
01:40:27,081 --> 01:40:27,820
Yeah.
Sorta,

2301
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:31,930
cause you know they don't win,
but it's good fun entertainment folks.

2302
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:34,730
Squirmy,
thank God the audience knows that

2303
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:38,780
failure and comedy is still a thing
that's not just like everything's not

2304
01:40:38,781 --> 01:40:41,990
just a special prefabricated a late
nights set.

2305
01:40:42,110 --> 01:40:45,800
I think a lot of people,
because they only see comedy in that

2306
01:40:45,890 --> 01:40:47,720
way,
they see specials on Netflix,

2307
01:40:48,110 --> 01:40:50,960
they see blade nights sets,
things that are tight in our formula

2308
01:40:50,961 --> 01:40:53,950
that had been practiced.
Then when they come see live comedy,

2309
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:58,090
I know an inch of any sort of faltering
and they're like,

2310
01:40:58,480 --> 01:40:59,920
what?
Well let me ask you this.

2311
01:40:59,921 --> 01:41:02,550
The pro e.
S.

2312
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:02,551
N.
T?

2313
01:41:02,551 --> 01:41:03,071
No,
you're,

2314
01:41:03,071 --> 01:41:06,400
I'm about to release her netflix.
Showtime on showtime.

2315
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:07,241
Oh,
show on showtime.

2316
01:41:07,241 --> 01:41:10,030
So when that comes out,
do you abandon your material now?

2317
01:41:10,650 --> 01:41:14,110
I mean I,
I've already started to to implement a

2318
01:41:14,111 --> 01:41:16,930
bunch of new stuff and do and do both
right now,

2319
01:41:16,990 --> 01:41:19,090
right before it even comes out.
Just cause I'm trying to get in the

2320
01:41:19,091 --> 01:41:20,740
habit.
But yeah,

2321
01:41:20,741 --> 01:41:22,930
I mean I think so.
I mean that's a personal thing.

2322
01:41:22,931 --> 01:41:24,370
I don't,
I don't think there's a right or wrong

2323
01:41:24,371 --> 01:41:26,440
way to do it,
but I think I'm trying to,

2324
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:29,140
uh,
get rid of that stuff and try all new

2325
01:41:29,141 --> 01:41:31,030
stuff.
I'm going to stop doing your shit.

2326
01:41:31,070 --> 01:41:31,903
Probably.

2327
01:41:34,150 --> 01:41:35,890
You do it so much better.
That's the problem.

2328
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:38,650
That's high.
I sit and watch you do me after.

2329
01:41:38,890 --> 01:41:39,311
No.
Yeah.

2330
01:41:39,311 --> 01:41:41,660
I'm trying to abandon.
I think I,

2331
01:41:41,710 --> 01:41:45,340
but I don't,
I'm not trying to do a special every

2332
01:41:45,341 --> 01:41:46,570
year type of thing.
I don't think that's,

2333
01:41:46,571 --> 01:41:48,610
for me.
I know that that's like the new thing,

2334
01:41:48,611 --> 01:41:51,460
but I don't,
I think even louise backed off of that.

2335
01:41:51,990 --> 01:41:53,320
I mean,
I know a lot of people have that

2336
01:41:53,321 --> 01:41:55,720
aspiration of like,
I'll do one every fucking year and I'm

2337
01:41:55,721 --> 01:41:56,311
always like,
what?

2338
01:41:56,311 --> 01:41:57,400
What,
what for though?

2339
01:41:57,660 --> 01:41:59,190
We'll wait to see what kind of year you
have.

2340
01:41:59,250 --> 01:42:00,061
Yeah.
I mean,

2341
01:42:00,061 --> 01:42:01,200
I am years,
right?

2342
01:42:01,201 --> 01:42:03,360
Like a motherfucker and I have years
where I'm like,

2343
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:06,990
I'll look like,
I'll look at a set list on my computer

2344
01:42:06,991 --> 01:42:08,160
that says like,
you know,

2345
01:42:08,161 --> 01:42:11,070
January,
2016 and I looked at it recently,

2346
01:42:11,071 --> 01:42:12,060
I'm like,
wow,

2347
01:42:12,061 --> 01:42:15,180
this is not that different than what I'm
doing now.

2348
01:42:15,181 --> 01:42:16,940
You're like,
I see a bunch of stuff I tried.

2349
01:42:16,941 --> 01:42:18,900
It didn't work right.
And then I have years where,

2350
01:42:18,901 --> 01:42:21,090
yeah,
I will come up with close to an hour.

2351
01:42:21,190 --> 01:42:22,400
It's going to be the year where every

2352
01:42:22,490 --> 01:42:23,780
comedy,
the trump,

2353
01:42:23,781 --> 01:42:25,280
that's the one thing.
Every comic,

2354
01:42:25,281 --> 01:42:29,270
we'll have three specials.
I want everyone to have three.

2355
01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:31,760
Everyone's going to get three.
Dude,

2356
01:42:31,761 --> 01:42:34,040
you can do trump a little.
Just a little bit.

2357
01:42:34,041 --> 01:42:35,840
Do you mean give me a little song.
I heard it.

2358
01:42:36,020 --> 01:42:38,060
I like Joe Rogan.
Joe's good.

2359
01:42:38,120 --> 01:42:39,800
He's,
you know what is a fighter?

2360
01:42:39,860 --> 01:42:40,940
That's what I like.
Fighters.

2361
01:42:41,030 --> 01:42:42,320
He's a fighter.
I like fighters.

2362
01:42:42,490 --> 01:42:43,210
It's not bad.

2363
01:42:43,210 --> 01:42:45,220
It's good.
Except you gotta get the are out of

2364
01:42:45,221 --> 01:42:45,911
their other New York.
Yep.

2365
01:42:45,911 --> 01:42:46,220
Yep.

2366
01:42:46,220 --> 01:42:49,280
Yeah.
You're close enough fight and you're

2367
01:42:49,281 --> 01:42:51,170
like,
almost you from Chicago.

2368
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:52,790
Oh,
shake you down.

2369
01:42:52,820 --> 01:42:53,720
You could do this.
Like,

2370
01:42:53,721 --> 01:42:56,660
I can't do as a voice.
I can't make that sound like I can

2371
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:59,780
imitate certain people's voices,
but I have a very limited range.

2372
01:42:59,781 --> 01:43:00,380
Yeah.
You know,

2373
01:43:00,380 --> 01:43:01,760
like the people that I could do,
I could do good,

2374
01:43:01,761 --> 01:43:04,430
but I can't do him.
He's self as someone was saying how

2375
01:43:04,431 --> 01:43:05,500
hard,
uh,

2376
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:09,590
like trump has almost so quote unquote
simple that like,

2377
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:12,980
that's why anybody that comes down on
snl and there's people can just,

2378
01:43:13,070 --> 01:43:14,660
it was a lot of people that can do the
impression,

2379
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:16,640
but they were saying how hard hillary
was,

2380
01:43:17,570 --> 01:43:19,280
which I get,
I didn't really think about it,

2381
01:43:19,281 --> 01:43:19,881
but I was like,
oh yeah,

2382
01:43:19,881 --> 01:43:22,760
that is such a,
she's such a fucking hard voice to

2383
01:43:22,761 --> 01:43:23,990
imitate.
Do you know what I mean?

2384
01:43:23,991 --> 01:43:25,460
Like it's such a chump.
Trump is,

2385
01:43:25,461 --> 01:43:28,370
that's another reason it's so
cartoonishly perfect that you're like

2386
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:33,200
anybody who can do the voice.
A voice like [inaudible] like that is

2387
01:43:33,201 --> 01:43:35,150
going to get Bernie.
It was easy as hell.

2388
01:43:35,210 --> 01:43:36,890
Oh my God.
He's just an old jail.

2389
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:38,250
It just was Larry David.
Yeah.

2390
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:40,360
Yeah.
Brian was the same fucking medical

2391
01:43:40,370 --> 01:43:42,870
revolution.
And then we're going out for soup.

2392
01:43:43,230 --> 01:43:46,460
Okay.
So everybody pays for her own food.

2393
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:49,220
He's like Jackie Mason a little bit.
Hey,

2394
01:43:49,730 --> 01:43:51,560
hey listen kid.

2395
01:43:52,430 --> 01:43:53,450
He said to the pope,
I said,

2396
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:54,380
I met the pope.
I said,

2397
01:43:54,381 --> 01:43:57,140
listen kid,
what a great job with the Catholics.

2398
01:43:57,590 --> 01:43:59,880
Did you see him today?
He was doing that.

2399
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:03,680
He did something he today or yesterday,
Bernie Sanders,

2400
01:44:03,681 --> 01:44:05,660
where as grilling,
the guy that was at the Senate

2401
01:44:05,661 --> 01:44:09,110
confirmation hearings trying to make
some sense of all of this.

2402
01:44:09,830 --> 01:44:14,830
They don't know how to put the thing
in the sky.

2403
01:44:15,970 --> 01:44:18,820
That's kind of a climate change denier.
Yes,

2404
01:44:18,850 --> 01:44:21,290
so you're telling me that you're
responsible for the climate.

2405
01:44:21,650 --> 01:44:23,920
You don't even know if it's [inaudible].
You're fucking you,

2406
01:44:23,930 --> 01:44:28,930
you.
It's actually the climate change denier.

2407
01:44:29,211 --> 01:44:32,080
He's a skeptic to the science.
You think it's true.

2408
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:33,200
You deny it.
You think it's true.

2409
01:44:33,201 --> 01:44:34,670
You the night.
What's the truth?

2410
01:44:36,910 --> 01:44:38,980
Let's get soap.
That's a good some soup.

2411
01:44:39,050 --> 01:44:41,390
You still owe me $2 for that split split
peas.

2412
01:44:43,820 --> 01:44:45,680
He's got a tab at canter's.
He said,

2413
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:47,960
listen,
I don't know my Qantas Tab.

2414
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:53,050
I was the lockers for no baby.
I would love to have an only child as

2415
01:44:55,380 --> 01:44:56,570
well.
He is.

2416
01:44:56,810 --> 01:44:59,120
He's,
he seems like a genuinely nice guy.

2417
01:44:59,530 --> 01:45:00,200
Who Does?
Who's that?

2418
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:01,310
Bernie Sanders seems like a g.
Yeah,

2419
01:45:01,311 --> 01:45:02,060
he does.
He does.

2420
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:05,300
He to me does.
He seemed like a bowling ball but,

2421
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:05,990
but,
but,

2422
01:45:05,990 --> 01:45:09,290
but don't we know that anybody who has
kind of the audacity and fucking self

2423
01:45:09,291 --> 01:45:13,070
indulgence to want to be president is
also behind the true fucking crazy.

2424
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:16,220
You're fucking crazy person.
I'm sure he's a nice person.

2425
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:21,020
I was there for the right reasons.
I beg to differ Bernie 22 years in the

2426
01:45:21,021 --> 01:45:23,360
Senate or the mayor of my town of a
more,

2427
01:45:23,361 --> 01:45:27,210
isn't it possible that someone could not
want to be president until they realize

2428
01:45:27,211 --> 01:45:30,170
that the country is back is up against
the wall and that's when he finally ran

2429
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:33,890
is that it is possible for you to
realize that there was no hope on the

2430
01:45:33,891 --> 01:45:38,200
horizon for the status quo or this is
new thing,

2431
01:45:38,220 --> 01:45:41,090
this trump thing and he's like,
maybe I'll go.

2432
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:44,750
Do you think,
do you think had had had the DNC not

2433
01:45:44,751 --> 01:45:47,720
fucking strategically shoved Hillary
Clinton in front of him?

2434
01:45:47,721 --> 01:45:52,040
If he had fucking one do youth,
do you think he could be trump?

2435
01:45:52,690 --> 01:45:54,010
That's a,
that's an,

2436
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:56,950
you know,
it's just an open speculation.

2437
01:45:58,790 --> 01:46:00,950
Who knows how it would've played out?
I'm sorry.

2438
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:02,780
I'm sorry.
I'm a fucking curious to see that.

2439
01:46:02,781 --> 01:46:06,470
I would love not something I'm prepared
to discuss at this time,

2440
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:08,510
but will you,
what do you think you would have one

2441
01:46:08,511 --> 01:46:09,650
Bernie,
or what do you think you would have

2442
01:46:09,651 --> 01:46:12,710
fucking beat trump?
I think I would have give him a run for

2443
01:46:12,711 --> 01:46:14,220
his money.
I think our water,

2444
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:17,840
one of the two states
lucky states.

2445
01:46:17,841 --> 01:46:18,674
You think you would have,

2446
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:21,600
I think I went to one in a meeting,
Michigan.

2447
01:46:21,601 --> 01:46:24,180
You had it down and cut the head.
I would have been very competitive with

2448
01:46:24,181 --> 01:46:25,860
the trump campaign.
Oh Wow.

2449
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:29,070
What about outside of right?
Definitely.

2450
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:30,800
Definitely.
Definitely.

2451
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:33,430
You should do your trump impression now
and you guys should do,

2452
01:46:34,230 --> 01:46:36,750
listen,
I'm sorry,

2453
01:46:36,930 --> 01:46:40,350
Mr President.
I can't accept your presidency.

2454
01:46:40,710 --> 01:46:43,440
I'm stepping out of government.
I'm taking a job at Goldman Sachs.

2455
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:44,850
I need to make some money.

2456
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:47,750
You're welcome.
That's what I would say.

2457
01:46:47,751 --> 01:46:50,110
You're welcome.
I think done for you boarding

2458
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:52,410
you've ever done for me,
so you're welcome.

2459
01:46:53,010 --> 01:46:56,010
You want to make college free?
You got to make college free.

2460
01:46:56,011 --> 01:46:57,660
I'm going to charge four times for
college.

2461
01:46:57,661 --> 01:47:01,740
Four times more debt with Detroit.
Don't beg me.

2462
01:47:01,850 --> 01:47:04,170
Don't beg me.
Don't any tax returns.

2463
01:47:04,590 --> 01:47:07,680
I'm not going to show you my tax bills
to your Baba.

2464
01:47:07,890 --> 01:47:12,890
I don't think so.
My stylist does what he does very well.

2465
01:47:14,021 --> 01:47:16,230
She does very well.
I have a trans stylist,

2466
01:47:16,231 --> 01:47:17,860
by the way.
I have a transcendence.

2467
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:20,100
You want to talk about Trans Culture?
I Have Trans Dialis.

2468
01:47:20,430 --> 01:47:22,260
Okay.
Don't tell me I don't like the Lgbtq.

2469
01:47:23,180 --> 01:47:25,760
I'm very low budget.
I'm working on,

2470
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:28,380
I care more about the important things
in life.

2471
01:47:28,830 --> 01:47:30,300
He looked like you should have at the
dollar store.

2472
01:47:30,330 --> 01:47:31,980
It's pathetic.
I try to control that.

2473
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:33,960
They were harder to digest to your
forum.

2474
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:35,760
Trump steaks are delicious.
Don't listen to that.

2475
01:47:36,810 --> 01:47:39,240
They're better than Omaha steaks.
Don't listen to that.

2476
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:42,300
We have premium cows.
I powers are beautiful.

2477
01:47:42,330 --> 01:47:45,570
They're shipped over from Russia,
from from California.

2478
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:51,180
But appreciate your racist comments that
you've made in the past.

2479
01:47:51,210 --> 01:47:52,650
I'm not racist.
Sound ratio.

2480
01:47:52,690 --> 01:47:54,930
Um,
ratio with disabilities.

2481
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:55,591
Uh,
what,

2482
01:47:55,591 --> 01:47:56,071
what,
what?

2483
01:47:56,071 --> 01:47:58,800
I can mock a retard anymore.
What's the news coming to today?

2484
01:47:58,801 --> 01:48:01,200
I can't do that.
I can't sit up there and Joko by risks

2485
01:48:01,201 --> 01:48:03,600
like we used to when we were seven,
screw you.

2486
01:48:03,601 --> 01:48:06,510
Burn.
I'm going to mark a charred once in a

2487
01:48:06,511 --> 01:48:08,220
while.
Get used to in America.

2488
01:48:11,190 --> 01:48:13,680
That's legitimately what that was.
The Gym.

2489
01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:15,270
What would come out of his fucking
brain,

2490
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:18,840
that's for sure.
And you know what that would be fed live

2491
01:48:18,841 --> 01:48:21,510
to America and argument between those
two at fucking,

2492
01:48:21,511 --> 01:48:23,790
his fans would love it even more.
Like he's right.

2493
01:48:23,791 --> 01:48:25,980
He should mock fucking read.
Fine Fun.

2494
01:48:26,730 --> 01:48:28,140
That's what my buddy said to his mom.
He was like,

2495
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:33,320
she was a die hard trump supporter and
he said justify seriously to me justify

2496
01:48:34,260 --> 01:48:37,230
how he could mock a handicapped person.

2497
01:48:38,010 --> 01:48:39,410
She just tell me,
tell me the,

2498
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:42,360
what's the fucking spin on that?
He said it was,

2499
01:48:42,390 --> 01:48:45,330
it wasn't because he was hint,
just watch it once.

2500
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:47,130
Volume off.
Watch it once.

2501
01:48:47,580 --> 01:48:52,000
No one in the world.
If someone who speaks no English and as

2502
01:48:52,001 --> 01:48:54,170
it doesn't understand,
our culture would go well.

2503
01:48:54,171 --> 01:48:56,550
They're probably making fun of it.
Looks like they're making fun.

2504
01:48:56,551 --> 01:48:58,350
I'll make him a of character of
somebody.

2505
01:48:58,980 --> 01:49:00,090
It's just,
it was this kid,

2506
01:49:00,091 --> 01:49:02,680
he was a comedian.
He does that about everybody that he

2507
01:49:02,681 --> 01:49:06,030
thinks is flustered.
There's like a whole series really

2508
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:07,291
thinks.
He goes,

2509
01:49:07,291 --> 01:49:09,690
Ooh,
he does that with when no one knows what

2510
01:49:09,691 --> 01:49:10,411
they're doing.
Oh,

2511
01:49:10,411 --> 01:49:14,640
and he's trying to figure this out.
Literally that's his thing that he does

2512
01:49:14,790 --> 01:49:18,690
when I'm not defending him,
but the real fact is he always does.

2513
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,340
I right.
They showed a video of the loop it but,

2514
01:49:20,490 --> 01:49:24,060
but specifically he did like this arm
thing like that.

2515
01:49:24,240 --> 01:49:26,260
Yeah.
More specific,

2516
01:49:26,590 --> 01:49:30,880
more extra sassy like risks banging
against each other.

2517
01:49:30,881 --> 01:49:34,200
Can you have a move?
He does this in some of them open handy

2518
01:49:34,230 --> 01:49:38,370
and then this was kind of like,
I mean it was just like what you would

2519
01:49:38,580 --> 01:49:41,850
when you were a punk kid in third grade
or fourth grade was we're doing to each

2520
01:49:41,851 --> 01:49:45,540
other mocking shit.
It was like so obvious that that's what

2521
01:49:45,541 --> 01:49:46,800
the boys,
this comic,

2522
01:49:46,830 --> 01:49:48,190
and I know you guys probably

2523
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:49,960
won't even remember him,
but he was in la comic,

2524
01:49:49,961 --> 01:49:52,570
one of those guys.
It was just always around and you never

2525
01:49:52,571 --> 01:49:55,630
really saw him go on stage much.
Earl Skakel and he,

2526
01:49:55,631 --> 01:49:56,920
uh,
he had this,

2527
01:49:57,220 --> 01:50:02,220
he had these giant front teeth and like
a receded upper lip so that his teeth

2528
01:50:02,860 --> 01:50:06,520
just like jutted out.
And I'm talking to him and I don't know

2529
01:50:06,521 --> 01:50:10,810
what the fuck was going through my mind,
but subconsciously I like,

2530
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:15,310
you hurled my slip up above my teeth.
And then he just looked at me and he

2531
01:50:15,311 --> 01:50:16,180
goes,
oh,

2532
01:50:16,181 --> 01:50:17,620
that's really funny.
That's really,

2533
01:50:17,621 --> 01:50:22,570
and I realize like in a second that I
was doing it right and I was so fucking

2534
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:24,400
embarrassed.
I didn't know what to say.

2535
01:50:27,060 --> 01:50:28,600
That's kind of like when someone's like,
yeah,

2536
01:50:28,601 --> 01:50:31,090
when someone's twitching,
you just naturally just do it with them

2537
01:50:31,091 --> 01:50:33,370
for some think it's a monkey response.
Monkey see,

2538
01:50:33,371 --> 01:50:36,940
monkey do.
It's like subcon's yawns and you start

2539
01:50:36,941 --> 01:50:38,050
yawning,
right?

2540
01:50:38,110 --> 01:50:40,900
Holy Shit.
Or when someone has a fucking thing on

2541
01:50:40,901 --> 01:50:41,734
their face,
you,

2542
01:50:41,950 --> 01:50:44,500
you just kind of even feel it on your
face.

2543
01:50:44,501 --> 01:50:45,340
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah,

2544
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:47,750
there,
but you start to like feel it on your

2545
01:50:47,751 --> 01:50:48,960
own face and then you've got to go,
dude,

2546
01:50:48,961 --> 01:50:50,630
if fucking,
what are you doing,

2547
01:50:50,631 --> 01:50:51,464
Jeff?
Ross?

2548
01:50:52,070 --> 01:50:56,210
Somebody knocked.
There was no one that shit.

2549
01:50:57,580 --> 01:50:58,520
I got to go.
Anyway.

2550
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,530

01:52:38,391 --> 01:52:41,000
We could do some shit to this room.
This room is pretty bad ass.

2597
01:52:41,030 --> 01:52:44,660
It's cool that they have it.
Also open it up.

2598
01:52:44,990 --> 01:52:45,823

It's cool.

2603
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:54,640

We're going to get back to get a TV down
here.

2608
01:53:01,331 --> 01:53:04,210
We can see what's going on on stage.
Would you get a monitor and watch

2609
01:53:04,211 --> 01:53:06,340
everybody?
That would be fun.

2610

That would be so fun.
Yeah,

2611
01:53:07,451 --> 01:53:09,070
