1
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:06,743
Three.
Two,

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,390
one.
Happy New Year.

3
00:00:11,391 --> 00:00:16,391
Tom Pub.
Yeah.

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,140
Happy you get.
Thank you for the gift.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,980
You're welcome.
I've always wanted one of these.

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,750
It's amazing.
Really.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,820
It is.
I got two things that I really don't

8
00:00:27,821 --> 00:00:31,630
want today.
One was herpes.

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,660
No yeezys
you'll love him.

10
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,580
Jamie thinks,
oh love.

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,900
He got me here and I said,
take these bags.

12
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,490
These are yours.
Do you keep him?

13
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,530
Hey,
he came back and brought me the right

14
00:00:44,531 --> 00:00:47,350
size.
He had cysts first.

15
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:49,090
He brought me to the Bronx.
What's wrong with them?

16
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,970
That they're fucking preposterous.
Let me see him.

17
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,500
Your um,
Brendan Chop.

18
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:59,210
They're the perfect thing because
they're in,

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,340
this looks like something from the
nineties yeah,

20
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,180
like some kind of shoe from the 90s.
Now what level of outrage would there be

21
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:12,350
if I started wearing these to run the
mountains?

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,690
What if they were really comfortable and
you like them?

23
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,290
I know what's going on.
So you think that if I put him on,

24
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,200
I would all of a sudden love them and I
would get it.

25
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,490
Those are street.
Maybe.

26
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,270
Are Those for the street?
Does he have like a bird?

27
00:01:26,271 --> 00:01:31,070
He'll worthy of wake up extra hook in
the back of the heel?

28
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,710
Yeah.
Like why is it go like a normal heel?

29
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,690
Like here's a normal heels,
right?

30
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,260
Those flat flush,
it's flat.

31
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,020
It's like goes out at an angle on those
two.

32
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,520
That does too.
Is the boost.

33
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:45,200
It's the style of shoe.
It's the bottom.

34
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,420
It's what it's of the Adidas.
Is it the style or is it the uh,

35
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,250
the shape?
Is it the style or is it the feel that

36
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:55,010
you really like the feel?
Bubba won't both.

37
00:01:55,011 --> 00:01:57,050
Honestly both.
But these were really comfortable shoes.

38
00:01:57,051 --> 00:02:00,350
The boost is super comfortable.
Is this a adidas made shoe?

39
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,040
Is that,
yep.

40
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,330
Oh,
so didas makes,

41
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,700
yeah.
And there's just no adidas logo on

42
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:07,010
there.
So it's hard to tell that he's starting

43
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:11,360
to like them starting to warm up while I
weird how they have this like military

44
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:13,290
style number.
Yup.

45
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,850
Thing on the side.
Like some fucking Korean missile

46
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,710
quit.
Is there,

47
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,230
I couldn't tell you what it stands for.
I've seen it.

48
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,550
Multiple things.
It could just be supply or could you

49
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:25,170
come up?
It could be an acronym for something.

50
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:25,491
I don't know.
Yeah,

51
00:02:25,491 --> 00:02:30,230
they look like they're from the nineties
enjoy them.

52
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,900
Thank you sir.
Why an accordion?

53
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,370
Like what is,
are you a monkey?

54
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,550
No,
the guy that has the accordion,

55
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,910
the monkey dance monkey dance is,
I love the sound of the accordion and I

56
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:41,744
just,
uh,

57
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,850
I saw it and I just wanted to bring
something to the new studio.

58
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:46,790
I like how you have a lot of weird shit
here.

59
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,440
And this is weird that somebody loved
this sound so much that they decided

60
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,960
let's make an instrument out of it.
Yeah.

61
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,400
Are there like real complicated ones?
Those are like big to people play them

62
00:02:58,401 --> 00:02:59,950
and orchestras and shit.

63
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,200
No,
I don't think they made it into the

64
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:06,100
orchestra and so it's never been like a
really respected piece of musical

65
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:09,220
instrument design at Co.
New Orleans Buckwheat,

66
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:10,270
Zydeco.
You ever hear that?

67
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:11,310
Sure.
Yeah.

68
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,530
Back like,
Oh papa poke a lot of Polish.

69
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:18,160
Booka Zam fear master of the Pan Flute.
Of course.

70
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:21,490
What happened to that poor bastard?
Like he had a whole marketing team

71
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:22,121
behind me.
Like,

72
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:23,560
dude,
no one's done this.

73
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,300
No one's done this,
but we're going to do this.

74
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,480
You can master the Pan Flute,
Dvds,

75
00:03:27,481 --> 00:03:29,830
cds,
vhs tapes.

76
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,770
We're going to sell it all.
There's literally no competition.

77
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,200
There's nothing you can do that your Zam
Fair.

78
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:38,610
He's the Tony Hawk of the Pan Flute,
right and areas.

79
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,060
Give me some volume with the sky.

80
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,540
Beautiful music,
radio and TV.

81
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,930
Look at the chest hair and the change.
What?

82
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,630
Gold chain around the world.

83
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,530
20 million records.
What is

84
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:57,490
Zam fear that he will get book Tom in
his magnificent,

85
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,290
he looks like a guy that works on the
jelly.

86
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:01,980
That is

87
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,340
very forgettable sound.
It's a recorder.

88
00:04:05,341 --> 00:04:08,970
It's for like window of the things you
learn when you're in fourth grade and

89
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:10,480
they teach them music.
Yeah,

90
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,920
that goofy flu like thing.
I never,

91
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,490
I never paid attention to the recorder
because they gave me the recorder and

92
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:20,050
I'll go,
well how come I don't see this bands

93
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,240
the fuck outta here.
I'm not going to spend some time

94
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:29,100
learning an instrument that no one place
you had to though need to carry it in

95
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:31,650
your sock.
You remember you had to put it in your

96
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:33,210
sock.
They didn't even have cases.

97
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,930
They just give you a good get old tube
sock from your dad and put it in there

98
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,450
he go be cancer.
Right.

99
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,160
No,
makes a case for the fucking recorder.

100
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,910
Now you have to put in your dad's sock
and it didn't make any sense either that

101
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:45,361
it was,
oh,

102
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:48,480
he's got it tall,
but he plays a flute.

103
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,250
Right?
Well it said Pan flute when I typed it

104
00:04:50,251 --> 00:04:50,550
in,
but,

105
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,430
oh,
flute rock.

106
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,740
Well,
he's a bad motherfucker.

107
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,940
Yeah.
JETHRO tull.

108
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,470
He's winning crazy looking dude.
He looks like he lives in a hollowed out

109
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:05,070
tree.
Right?

110
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,250
He does.
Oh my God.

111
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,380
Scurries out when you walk by on the
trail.

112
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,840
I know.
Has anybody else figured out how to use

113
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:15,930
the flute in rock and roll music besides
Jethro Tull?

114
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,610
I haven't spent some flute.
There's been a

115
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,770
but not like him right now where it's
not worth hard of it.

116
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:25,930
The lead.
He's the lead guy.

117
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,560
Isn't that weird how like a band will
come along and they'll just figure out

118
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:31,420
how to do something that no one's
figured out.

119
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,590
Yeah,
yeah,

120
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:34,450
exactly.
Now we're going to do this.

121
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,550
Yeah,
we're just going to throw a flute in the

122
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:38,870
mix and then everybody's like,
okay,

123
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,060
I like it.
Hey,

124
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,903
it kind of works.

125
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,310
Should we get a flute?
I was,

126
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:46,310
uh,
I was doing this show last weekend and

127
00:05:46,311 --> 00:05:49,790
this guy had an oboe.
He was like the in San Francisco.

128
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:54,200
He's one of the,
like the oboist in the world and he's

129
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:56,390
playing,
this instrument is very melancholy,

130
00:05:56,391 --> 00:05:58,030
just beautiful.
But it really

131
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,900
was occurring to me like,
why,

132
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,980
who built this,
who thought this sound was so important

133
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,470
when they decided we're going to make an
instrument so we can re recreate this

134
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:12,760
feeling and this sound for all those
instruments and the stuff.

135
00:06:12,761 --> 00:06:15,200
She gave me a pen and a paper and told
me to draw an Oba,

136
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:17,150
I'd be fucked.
Yeah.

137
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:18,770
I,
it was not what I thought it was.

138
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,373
I was like,
Oh,

139
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,380
before he pulled up a picture of it,
let me think of what it looks like.

140
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:25,880
Well,
I want to think,

141
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,160
and I'm thinking of a trombone,
I'm thinking of a thing,

142
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,410
but it's definitely not.
That was way bigger.

143
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,150
Yeah.
We'll kind of pull it up.

144
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:34,040
Let me see what the elbow is straight
out.

145
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,190
It looks like a flute.
Yeah,

146
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,370
it's straight.
It looks almost like a clarinet.

147
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,350
Clarinet.
That's what I'm thinking.

148
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:42,820
Not a flute that looks more clarinet was
pretty bad ass

149
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:49,350
oboe and pop that's in waterworld not
done moving.

150
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:53,810
Right.
That's an example of world's a terrible

151
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:56,000
moving water.
World's a terrible movie,

152
00:06:56,001 --> 00:07:00,680
but they have a damn good themed show at
universal.

153
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,450
It's very good.
It's really good.

154
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:04,820
But it's amazing.
It's like nobody watched that fucking

155
00:07:04,821 --> 00:07:09,821
movie and it was a gigantic flop,
but still in 2018 they put on a Jamun

156
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,270
live show kicks ass waterworld so
everybody's like,

157
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:14,540
wait,
wait,

158
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,460
wait.
What the fuck is this based on?

159
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:23,030
This is some sort of dystopian world
where like everybody is drowning,

160
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,661
right?
Yeah.

161
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:25,970
The water is risen to the top of
everything.

162
00:07:25,971 --> 00:07:30,140
And then these baddies and good people
and and then this done people that are

163
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:34,730
risking their lives is explosions of
file flying jet skis.

164
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,910
I went to see what my salary is.
Great.

165
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,310
We got fucking drenched by the way.
If you're going to go to see this good

166
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:42,650
seats don't go during the cold that it
doesn't matter.

167
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:43,790
Good or bad seats,
man,

168
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,850
that shit goes up into the 15th 16th
rose.

169
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,580
I look at that.
That is a good production value.

170
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:53,390
It's great cause it's like a play,
but it's fun to watch.

171
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,690
That's it's very enjoyable.
That's all Kevin Costner had to do was

172
00:07:56,691 --> 00:07:59,600
just do this.
He didn't have to make that check.

173
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:01,850
Antic movie.
That movie just hopper.

174
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,050
That movie was a,
I had some friends that worked on it.

175
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,200
There were stunt people and they were
just talking about the amount of money

176
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,530
that like whenever you feel me,
anything involving water,

177
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,010
like you're fine.
Everything is insanely expensive.

178
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:19,010
Right?
Camera's here.

179
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,140
It's all under water,
but he's water.

180
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,030
It's wet,
everything's wet.

181
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:23,864
It's like,
yeah,

182
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,910
it was crazy and it sucked.
Aw,

183
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,410
it did suck.
I tried to watch it actually.

184
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:34,190
Basically fucking terrible movie.
It's a cool idea that like the seas have

185
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:38,210
risen and there you've got to either
have to live on this boat.

186
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,250
Yeah.
But like he's in like a fight for his

187
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:42,920
life and shit and he's going to fucking
cigar in his mouth and they love those

188
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:43,551
movies.
Yeah.

189
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:47,000
And they have weird like comedic guys
and then Dennis Hopper is kind of looks

190
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:48,460
cool,
but it's kind of weird.

191
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,200
I see like these guys are about to shoot
him and he's got a cigar in his mouth.

192
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,471
Like,
look,

193
00:08:51,471 --> 00:08:53,270
everybody's dirty,
but it's wet out.

194
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,680
It's like,
it's like the water.

195
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:57,450
You fuck dirty,
stinky bitch.

196
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,420
Just there's water everywhere.
That's a great point.

197
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,500
Why are they filthy places a tub?
It's because it's a rip off of Mad Max.

198
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,310
Yeah.
Max.

199
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:13,200
The dystopian Mad Max movie was made at
a place with no fucking water here in

200
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:17,250
the desert and a reason to be dirty.
Fucking plagiarists just jump in the

201
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:19,500
water.
He's fighting for his life and he's got

202
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:21,990
a cigar in his mouth.
Spit the Cigarro Yukon.

203
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,390
You're going to get shot.
Jesus.

204
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,150
Jesus Christ.
I did like that boat though.

205
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:29,010
That was a pretty cool boat that he
could control.

206
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:32,070
The whole thing is kind of,
it's bad,

207
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,650
but it's not nearly as bad as the
postman.

208
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,520
The Post Osman was another dystopian
movie that was a colossal failure

209
00:09:40,771 --> 00:09:42,960
starring Kevin Costner.
But Kevin Costner,

210
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:44,730
who I'm not,
I'm not shitting on Kevin Costner,

211
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:45,090
was huge.

212
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,650
Kevin Costner Fan.
I love that guy.

213
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,790
But he,
he was in a couple of stinkers to kind

214
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:54,420
of shark tanked him for a long time.
The Postman from 1997 is one of the

215
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,600
worst in the history of bad.
So bad that I will get high and watch it

216
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:03,820
occasionally just for the fucking Yuck.
I mean,

217
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,790
never even seen this one.
Oh yeah.

218
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,160
In the field.
That's CBT.

219
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,730
Ribisi whatever's,
yeah,

220
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:12,030
whatever.
Giovanni Ribisi you get kicked in the

221
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:14,610
head there and um,
in this movie,

222
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:17,340
like who is he?
Kevin Costner has to deliver the

223
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:20,040
letters.
It's like this big in the future.

224
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,150
There's no PA post office anymore,
so he's gotta be like the post man,

225
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,940
but they're trying to kill them book.
They're going to fucking get him.

226
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,580
He's got to run across the bridge.
He's like,

227
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,410
I've got lettuce.
It's got the mail.

228
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,380
What are you doing the fuck you doing
with these letters?

229
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,150
I'll go to bring them.
It's important.

230
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:38,520
We communicate.
It's just all because of dances with

231
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:41,580
wolves was so good.
And I tried to like re do it.

232
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,400
No,
this is not nothing like dances with

233
00:10:44,401 --> 00:10:46,470
wolves.
Get them back in the woods.

234
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,340
I think this is based on a novel,
if I remember correctly.

235
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,830
See if that movie the postman is based
on a novel.

236
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:57,831
I think it's based on a science fixture
or future fiction novel.

237
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,490
If I remember correctly.
I never even heard of that movie.

238
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,420
Oh,
it's so bad.

239
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:04,950
Great.
Yeah,

240
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:06,210
it is man at a book.
Okay.

241
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:07,320
Yeah.
So yeah,

242
00:11:07,321 --> 00:11:09,610
it's,
it's crazy.

243
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,850
It's about,
I think it might be like post nuclear

244
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:13,750
war or something.
Who's trying to stop them?

245
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,510
People don't like mail.
Guess what year it takes place in hope.

246
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,830
Let me guess.
2014

247
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,530
that's great.
The other day we were looking at,

248
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:26,364
um,
uh,

249
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,920
blade runner.
Blade runner is 2019.

250
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,070
Oh really?
Original one was 2019.

251
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,160
Wow.
Next year flying cars robusto off.

252
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,960
Not so well.
We might make it a book loan fast.

253
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:44,070
The thing is whatever does happen will
happen so fast.

254
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:46,950
We'll wish for something like blade
runner where there's some sort of

255
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:51,570
intermediate world where the technology
and the people coexist,

256
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,500
right?
Because we're just to be,

257
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,070
yeah,
we're just

258
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,380
going to be plugged into it like the
Matrix.

259
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,640
It's just going to be slow and then all
of a sudden it's going to be just,

260
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:05,380
if you go back to 1994 which is
essentially when most people started

261
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:07,240
logging on to,
you've got mail.

262
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,490
Yeah.
That's 24 years ago.

263
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,430
Okay.
That's not a long time nets at tiny

264
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:15,610
brief little moment in human history and
in 24 years,

265
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:19,060
the world's radically changed the way it
gets information completely.

266
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,690
Completely right now,
go 24 years from now,

267
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,250
it's probably going to be accelerated 10
fold from that point.

268
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,430
The moment artificial intelligence
happens to moment,

269
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,630
autonomous cars started happening.
The moment the boring company actually

270
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:39,010
has tunnels going through the bottom of
La and all of it's going to be fucking

271
00:12:39,011 --> 00:12:39,550
bananas.

272
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:44,550
I had a guy from a tesla energy at my
house yesterday and uh,

273
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:50,260
they bought solar city,
so it's no longer this solar company.

274
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:53,080
They're now tesla energy,
Tesla energies now of a car,

275
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,270
the trucks,
the batteries,

276
00:12:55,271 --> 00:12:58,980
the power wall generators and the solar
and this,

277
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,000
this guy comes in like he's from the
future.

278
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,230
He is dressed like a future guy in this
like black fitted thing,

279
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:09,160
these kind of like those shoes but in
white and he just kind of comes in.

280
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:12,070
He's really sharp and like really clear
and just goes through the thing.

281
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,920
He's probably an adderall and her thing
is that,

282
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:17,740
uh,
they're going to put a solar on the

283
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:22,420
roofs and then you have your power wall.
You're still connected to the grid

284
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,230
because you've got to,
they have to for political reasons,

285
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,620
but their whole thing,
they want to create tesla neighborhoods

286
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,900
where everybody starts feeding off of
each other.

287
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:36,310
They're just completely autonomous.
Tesla neighborhoods.

288
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,560
That's a good point.
Where you just said though about that

289
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:41,590
it's politically motivated that the
reason why they have to stay on the

290
00:13:41,591 --> 00:13:42,820
grid,
it's the only reason.

291
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,320
It's the only way.
They don't need it,

292
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:49,630
but in order to get things passed,
they can like have that big battery and

293
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:53,440
you're in your house.
They wouldn't let that happen unless,

294
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,930
because that really would mean that
you're completely cut off.

295
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,940
And the politicians just like,
no,

296
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,530
that's not happening.
Isn't that crazy?

297
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,663
Because

298
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,230
that's a more efficient way to do it.
You're getting the power from the sun.

299
00:14:05,231 --> 00:14:06,970
It's cleaner,
it's better for everybody.

300
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,440
And yet they're still like,
no,

301
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,600
no,
we want to keep these jobs,

302
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,020
keep the system.
We want to slow down progress.

303
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:17,290
We know we don't want everybody to have
to radically readjust.

304
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,260
Yeah.
And the,

305
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:24,310
and the costs are for energy or just
going up so quickly that in like three

306
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:26,970
years,
what you pay in southern California,

307
00:14:26,971 --> 00:14:30,390
he's almost going to double.
So it's three years.

308
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:31,224
Really?
Yeah.

309
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,730
Yeah.
Wow.

310
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,580
Cause there's a,
they have to reach benchmarks by 2020

311
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,220
did you see what Tesla did in Puerto
Rico?

312
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,773
No,
it do.

313
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,120
I remember him saying he was going to do
this and then there was no news coverage

314
00:14:45,121 --> 00:14:47,850
about it,
but their whole infrastructure was wiped

315
00:14:47,851 --> 00:14:52,851
out during the hurricane.
Like completely that old electric shot.

316
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,230
He had all these power walls,
they're giant batteries about the size

317
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:01,820
of the flag and they just store all of
this energy like a year's worth of

318
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:04,760
energy you can store.
And they were about to be shipped to

319
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:06,590
customers here in the u s who bought
them,

320
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:09,950
who want them in their house.
You know his backup generators basically

321
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,330
they're supposed to ship in January.
They're not shipping now until April

322
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,430
because he decided these people in
Puerto Rico need energy,

323
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,640
took all of those power walls,
ship them to Puerto Rico and has built

324
00:15:24,861 --> 00:15:29,030
this new infrastructure for Puerto Rico.
Hospitals are running on Tesla,

325
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,430
schools are running on Tesla.
Uh,

326
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:35,000
neighborhoods are running on it.
And it was this quiet little story like

327
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:38,600
nobody,
this is a kick ass company that went in

328
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:40,910
and literally is saving this island.

329
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,050
No Sin.
Fuck Oprah.

330
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:47,170
We need Elan Musk to run for president.
Tired of people saying Oprah the last

331
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,450
couple of days have been hell for crazy.
I love Oprah.

332
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:52,580
Don't get me wrong.
I think she's a wonderful woman.

333
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,480
I think she's a powerful force of good
and positive energy.

334
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,111
But Jane,
no,

335
00:15:57,111 --> 00:16:00,290
Eli.
But she also brought us doctor Oz and

336
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,980
the secret we have to remember with this
lady has done,

337
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,000
she has to be held accountable.
I forgive her,

338
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:12,650
but I mean cut the shit.
The secret is a particularly egregious

339
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,420
offense.
What you don't,

340
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,280
you just,
if you don't believe,

341
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:21,281
you don't believe who believe.
I want to be rich.

342
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,070
I just am rich.
I imagine myself flying.

343
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:30,800
I can fly.
I will beat my wings until I take off

344
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,913
what's up.
Yeah,

345
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:37,470
it was one of the more confused I want
us to disturb,

346
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:39,620
disturbing.
But it was confusing when that was

347
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:40,970
taking hold with people.

348
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,240
When I had friends that were telling me
that the secret is real and that they

349
00:16:46,551 --> 00:16:51,020
imagine they were going to fulfill these
childhood dreams that they had had about

350
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:53,390
whatever,
being a fucking astronaut,

351
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:54,650
whatever,
whatever it would be.

352
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,250
And there's a couple people that I knew,
they were trying to tell me that the

353
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:02,300
secret was going to be the thing and
that they had a vision board and they

354
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:05,000
had photographs.
They put pictures up of the things that

355
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:07,790
they want,
like them in front of large crowds and

356
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:08,450
shit.
And I'm like,

357
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:11,450
Oh boy,
this is the front of large crowds.

358
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,300
This is so not how it works.
Yeah.

359
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,660
But there is a kernel of it that works.
Yup.

360
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,260
Causative thinking,
you wanting something,

361
00:17:20,261 --> 00:17:24,550
you envisioning it,
but that's a little component and just

362
00:17:24,551 --> 00:17:26,830
how you live your life.
It's not just sitting in your,

363
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,750
you know what it's like and wishing it.
So

364
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,730
it's like saying,
I am going to be a bodybuilder because I

365
00:17:33,731 --> 00:17:36,250
drink water.
Yeah.

366
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,031
It's like,
no,

367
00:17:37,031 --> 00:17:40,210
you okay.
Ah Geez.

368
00:17:40,211 --> 00:17:41,560
Where do I start?
You?

369
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,820
You should drink water and it will help
you if you want to be a bodybuilder.

370
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,370
But I've talked to all these
bodybuilders and the one thing they have

371
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:51,450
in common is all drank water.
And they knew that if they drank water,

372
00:17:51,451 --> 00:17:53,610
they would be giant.
There'd be giant,

373
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:55,260
huge people.
It's all you've got to go.

374
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,650
Okay,
but did they also perform reps to

375
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:01,830
failure?
Did they also take steroids?

376
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,770
Did they also do these exercises?
Squats,

377
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:06,000
dead lifts,
curls,

378
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,430
you know,
did they do all that stuff too?

379
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,380
Yes,
but that but the water,

380
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,050
why aren't you believe her?
This is what it's like cause cause

381
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,030
they're saying like no,
these people,

382
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,580
they believe that they can do these
things.

383
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:17,820
Yeah.

384
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,370
They,
they,

385
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:22,530
they had this vision and they focus on
this vision and it came to fruition.

386
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,480
Yeah.
You know what they also did?

387
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:29,550
They also busted their fucking ass and
got lucky and we're in a business or

388
00:18:29,551 --> 00:18:34,551
career that they had some talent in and
figured out what that career is and

389
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:40,491
figured out how to navigate the very
weird waters of social interaction and

390
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,280
skill acquisition and success and
failure and learn from your failure and

391
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,430
luck.
Yeah.

392
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:51,630
That's a big problem is you're dealing
with complete sampling bias.

393
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,700
You're,
you're only asking people that are in

394
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:55,260
the mansions.
Tom Papa,

395
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,840
how did you do it?
I mean I see you here,

396
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,230
you have this place.
It's as big as the White House.

397
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,650
You have a giant lawn.
Did judge always know this was going to

398
00:19:04,651 --> 00:19:08,490
be your reality?
I saw it and I just put it on my vision

399
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:09,324
board.

400
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,770
Obviously it doesn't stick around and
be,

401
00:19:13,771 --> 00:19:16,470
didn't it became a fad because all these
people,

402
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,780
well at some point that's take the board
down.

403
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,870
Well and unfortunately some people died
because they,

404
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,330
um,
there was a story I was reading about

405
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:29,331
oprah unfortunately where this woman had
terminal cancer and she,

406
00:19:31,091 --> 00:19:35,700
she had stage three breast cancer and
just decided that through the secret she

407
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:39,390
was going to imagine herself a healthy
person and you know,

408
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,410
she eventually want them dying from it
because she,

409
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,010
she didn't get treatment.
The IAA I know,

410
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:48,480
I mean she,
she stopped traditional.

411
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:50,970
She stopped conventional medical
treatment.

412
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:56,300
But what part of,
so how far do you go with positive

413
00:19:57,061 --> 00:19:59,400
thinking?
Cause I see you as a fellow that,

414
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:03,630
uh,
has goals and I would think positive

415
00:20:03,631 --> 00:20:07,740
thinking plays into your life.
So what does that even mean?

416
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:09,520
Really?
Like do I think positive?

417
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,720
I,
I think in a positive way.

418
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,900
I try to be positive.
I try,

419
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,450
but when you're trying to accomplish
something,

420
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,020
whether you're trying to,
you know,

421
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,930
get better at something,
like say if you're playing a game,

422
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:28,170
like what if let's like golf,
like say take up golf and you want to be

423
00:20:28,171 --> 00:20:31,470
a really good golfer.
Like you start thinking about golf,

424
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:35,580
like how do I get better at golf?
You have to learn if to pay attention to

425
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,360
instructional videos,
you have to maybe seek out coaching.

426
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,960
You have to play some games and lose,
you have to choke under pressure.

427
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:46,500
You have to examine the mental game.
Like what is wrong with my mental

428
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:49,510
process when I approach a shot?
What is wrong with this?

429
00:20:49,511 --> 00:20:52,500
What is wrong with it?
And then become obsessed with the,

430
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:57,570
the idea of succeeding in that.
And I think that that can apply to

431
00:20:57,611 --> 00:20:58,180
everything.

432
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,360
So yeah,
I mean I certainly believe in positive

433
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:02,550
thinking,
but this,

434
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:05,200
that was like mystic nonsense.
No,

435
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:09,460
that tips over and it discounts all the
other stuff that you have to do.

436
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,830
There's something to the law of
attraction.

437
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:17,100
It is,
but it is one component to this gigantic

438
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,640
sort of spectrum of factors that have to
be taken into consideration when you're

439
00:21:23,921 --> 00:21:25,310
trying to succeed at something.
Yeah.

440
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,280
Positive thinking is one of them.
Yeah,

441
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,530
but it's also the understanding of how
to eliminate laziness,

442
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,590
how to discipline yourself,
how to write down goals,

443
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,650
how to,
how to make incremental steps towards

444
00:21:38,651 --> 00:21:41,740
improvement,
how to recognize failure is not just the

445
00:21:41,741 --> 00:21:45,160
end of all your hard work,
but in fact the beginning of a new

446
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:48,700
breakthrough because you understand like
how to never do this wrong,

447
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,050
wrong,
the wrong way again,

448
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,000
and the consequences of doing things
wrong.

449
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,880
It's like there's a lot of,
yeah,

450
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:58,480
there's a lot of factors in getting
better and succeeding at things and they

451
00:21:58,481 --> 00:22:02,050
boiled it down to the easiest one,
which is dreaming.

452
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,460
Right,
right.

453
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:04,750
Exactly.
Exactly.

454
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,870
And that's why it's sold.
But Oprah sold it.

455
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,063
I mean,
she was,

456
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,910
she was one of the big ones,
manage.

457
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,780
She was fucking 50 years old at the
time.

458
00:22:13,781 --> 00:22:15,430
I mean,
this is not a young woman who was

459
00:22:15,431 --> 00:22:17,530
selling this.
How old is open now?

460
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,900
75 89 no,
she just ran a marathon in four hours.

461
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,581
Did she?
Really?

462
00:22:24,581 --> 00:22:29,110
67 63 so we ran a marathon.
Yeah.

463
00:22:29,111 --> 00:22:33,430
So let's,
let's think of when the secret came out.

464
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:38,490
I want to say that was like 2006 six
2004 2006 so 12 years ago she was so she

465
00:22:41,591 --> 00:22:45,160
was 50 years old.
How the fuck did you not know when

466
00:22:45,161 --> 00:22:47,860
you're 50 years old,
they're worth $1 billion that that's not

467
00:22:47,861 --> 00:22:49,480
how it works.
But it's Hocus pocus.

468
00:22:49,481 --> 00:22:51,100
Yeah,
it's not hocus pocus.

469
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:55,030
Yeah,
and to sell that to people is crazy.

470
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:59,500
And that's a book that's sold.
I think I was reading it sold somewhere

471
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:01,540
in the neighborhood of 20 million
copies.

472
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,330
Wow.
Is that what it tells you on?

473
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,680
Geez,
that's crazy.

474
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,000
Well,
you want an easy way.

475
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:08,400
You want something that's easy.
Everybody wants,

476
00:23:08,401 --> 00:23:10,980
you're in trouble,
you're feeling whatever and they want

477
00:23:10,981 --> 00:23:13,860
something to come.
Something come and help me.

478
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:15,960
I mean that's where religion comes from.
It's just please,

479
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,940
there's that thing inside of us is like,
ah,

480
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,060
I want to believe if I believe,
is that enough?

481
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,570
It is a lot like that.
Yeah.

482
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:28,190
There was one of trump's spiritual
advisors was,

483
00:23:28,191 --> 00:23:30,400
uh,
he's got some spiritual advisors,

484
00:23:30,401 --> 00:23:31,490
some woman who was,
uh,

485
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,890
telling people to send her money.
There was a set,

486
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,250
send her money for January.
There was some,

487
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:40,940
so some whole article about it,
but it's basically essentially the same

488
00:23:40,941 --> 00:23:43,460
thing.
It's like the idea is that,

489
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:46,070
what is she saying?
Donald spiritual advisor.

490
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:50,390
Paula white suggest people send her
there January salary or face

491
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:53,600
consequences from God.
Is that true?

492
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,870
She's attractive too.
It's interesting.

493
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,280
Is that true?
Yeah.

494
00:23:58,281 --> 00:23:59,090
Look at her.
Pam.

495
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,630
I'll give you money.
What do I got to do?

496
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,720
What am I going to do?
Paula?

497
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,360
How much do you need?
I don't know if that's a good picture.

498
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:08,000
Maybe she just looks good when she's
screaming and she looks good.

499
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,920
But um,
yeah,

500
00:24:09,921 --> 00:24:13,280
I would love for some really,
I would love for the day where there's

501
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:16,490
some real powerful spiritual,
uh,

502
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,390
individual who doesn't ask for money.

503
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,500
You will that sound who doesn't,
who?

504
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,950
Real power.
Powerful or spiritual individual.

505
00:24:24,951 --> 00:24:26,180
It's a huckster.
I know.

506
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,050
That's what I mean.
Like,

507
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:30,080
it would be so great if some like,
so you listen to some people,

508
00:24:30,081 --> 00:24:32,300
like I watched,
I was doing some Gig and there was this

509
00:24:32,301 --> 00:24:36,680
black preacher and he was out on stage
and he's talking and it was like he's

510
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,310
really entertaining and he's,
and he had a couple of Nice things that

511
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:42,740
he was saying and then please send me
your money.

512
00:24:42,741 --> 00:24:43,521
And that is,
looks like,

513
00:24:43,521 --> 00:24:46,280
imagine if a guy showed up.
Well there is,

514
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:49,190
there's plenty of those people on
instagram who don't ask for doe.

515
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:49,910
Yeah,
they're not.

516
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:52,520
They're just trying to be okay.
Like Gary Vee for instance.

517
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:57,410
Gary v's whole thing is about hustling.
Gary v's like the anti secret.

518
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,470
He's hand tie the secret in,
in,

519
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:02,600
in.
You look at like what Gary Vee does.

520
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,520
Gary Vee is all about,
I was sick for several days,

521
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,770
so I was fighting some can all last
week.

522
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:10,620
Yeah,
I got it.

523
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,110
I got the flu,
I got the flu.

524
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:13,430
Uh,
I thought it had it.

525
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,620
Um,
like I left here.

526
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,700
Um,
so I'll,

527
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,210
I'll,
I'll,

528
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,440
I'm diverting,
but let me,

529
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,970
let me just get back to this Gary v
thing.

530
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,480
But what guys,
I do want to talk colds,

531
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,130
those book.
So I don't know if he's the best

532
00:25:25,131 --> 00:25:26,360
example.
He sells books,

533
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,620
but he's not asking for money.
I mean,

534
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,080
he's actually,
and he's actually a guy who was,

535
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:35,000
he's experienced some success as an
entrepreneur.

536
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,100
And I listened to people,
how do I say this without being mean?

537
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,400
There's a lot of people that are giving
advice online because people react well

538
00:25:47,151 --> 00:25:50,810
to it because they're,
they're giving advice because when they

539
00:25:50,811 --> 00:25:53,660
give advice,
people respond to it and they say,

540
00:25:53,661 --> 00:25:54,710
this is amazing.

541
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,450
And they'll,
they'll blanket and they'll,

542
00:25:56,451 --> 00:25:58,550
they'll give them positive feedback and
love,

543
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:03,730
but their advice is at least a certain
percent of it is just nonsense.

544
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,090
They're just talking,
right.

545
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,510
They're just trying to say things
they've heard before or they're trying

546
00:26:11,511 --> 00:26:16,511
to somehow or another put together a
sentence that sounds like you'll get

547
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:18,570
some likes.
Yeah.

548
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,423
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

549
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,400
There's a lot of guys,
you just got to surround yourself with

550
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:25,040
positive people to crystally.
It makes fun of those people in a

551
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,020
hilarious way.
He's great.

552
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:29,560
Or is it about Comedians who do it?
Oh,

553
00:26:29,561 --> 00:26:32,120
just not just comedians who do it,
but just people do it.

554
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:35,330
But here's the thing.
Sometimes people will say things that

555
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,750
are real and are really inspirational.
Yes,

556
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,230
and that's great too.
It's just knowing,

557
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,550
knowing horseshit.
Yes.

558
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,190
You got to know Horse Shit.
Know a lot of people don't know where

559
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:50,170
the Horse Shit is.
This secret is horse shit.

560
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:54,750
See that's the problem.
Gary v is inspirational and

561
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:56,700
motivational.
I guarantee you there's a lot of people

562
00:26:56,701 --> 00:27:00,930
out there that have done things in their
life that they might not have done

563
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:05,280
because of Gary v because he's a hustler
because he's really got a lot of energy

564
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,620
and he's like,
just fucking put down your phone.

565
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,630
You know,
go out there and get things done.

566
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:12,210
Sleep an hour less sleep,
a fucking hour left.

567
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,040
And it'll just tell you like,
do this,

568
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:14,960
sell that,
go.

569
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:18,630
And it gives you practical advice about
how to get started and get things done.

570
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,330
It's like the opposite of the secret.
Is this what seminars?

571
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,780
I'm sure Gary does shows at that.
It sounds like Tony Robbins,

572
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,940
he just sort of,
but he's more like,

573
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,760
I mean Tony Robbins,
he younger,

574
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,270
more energetic hustler character
crystal.

575
00:27:32,271 --> 00:27:35,790
He lives in the same play.
This give you some volume.

576
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,680
Pardon?
It says you could do anything you put

577
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:47,590
your mind to accept.
Most things is perseverance.

578
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:53,250
He's got an ego to shut down the town,
stopping,

579
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:59,080
remaining focused,
never quitting.

580
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,700
So funny.
Meanwhile he does all those things as

581
00:28:01,701 --> 00:28:05,150
well.
This is from his last special.

582
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,000
Meanwhile it works really funny.
The funny thing is Chris actually does

583
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:09,410
work hard.
I literally,

584
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,330
well yeah,
that's,

585
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,720
that's the kind of,
yeah.

586
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:15,410
I mean Kevin Hart now has moved into
that realm.

587
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:19,220
He has so many people listen to them and
all of a sudden they just,

588
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,263
you know,
he's,

589
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,680
I love him.
He's hilarious.

590
00:28:21,681 --> 00:28:23,870
He's a really good guy.
I've known him for a long time,

591
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:27,680
but now he's got so many followers and
he has so many people listening that

592
00:28:27,681 --> 00:28:29,600
he's starting to do that.
It's,

593
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,520
he's not just telling jokes,
he's doing crunches and telling you that

594
00:28:33,521 --> 00:28:36,320
you've got to believe in.
And I said to my daughter,

595
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,330
my daughter was like,
is he a comedian?

596
00:28:38,331 --> 00:28:40,820
She asked if she was showing the thing.
I said,

597
00:28:40,821 --> 00:28:41,930
yeah,
he's really funny.

598
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,730
I saw that this is a different thing.
I said,

599
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,740
do you think I can make videos that just
tell people to live better with David

600
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,920
like that?
No,

601
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:49,551
Dad.
Well,

602
00:28:49,551 --> 00:28:51,380
I'm guilty of that too.
I've done that too,

603
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:55,970
but if it's just,
there's things that you know that you've

604
00:28:55,971 --> 00:28:58,790
experienced and that you've done,
you want people to know about,

605
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:04,060
but it's not everything I say.
The problem with some people k all day,

606
00:29:04,341 --> 00:29:06,620
you're inspiring people.
That's all you fucking do,

607
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,760
right?
All you do,

608
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,400
right.
All you do is give out advice.

609
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,180
Yeah,
that's it.

610
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:14,140
What do you do?
Do you just advice give no,

611
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,770
there's it.
There's a thing about,

612
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,160
there's a thing about Kevin,
there's a thing about you that you

613
00:29:19,161 --> 00:29:20,630
watched somebody,
they're interesting.

614
00:29:20,631 --> 00:29:23,030
You like them and they're getting shit
done and you're like,

615
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,890
I'll take advice from this guy.
I will.

616
00:29:24,891 --> 00:29:26,210
I'll,
I'll hear what he has to say.

617
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:29,900
There is that element.
It's when it becomes bullshit.

618
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,640
Bullshit.
When it becomes,

619
00:29:31,641 --> 00:29:33,350
no,
you have to listen to me because I have

620
00:29:33,351 --> 00:29:34,520
all the answers,
right.

621
00:29:34,521 --> 00:29:36,590
And God talks to me and that kind of
stuff.

622
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,510
Well,
there's songs that,

623
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,160
there's love songs that you hear that
hit you

624
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,510
and you go,
wow.

625
00:29:43,511 --> 00:29:45,730
Like why is that?
Why does that resonate so,

626
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,800
so much?
Why is it so profound?

627
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:52,980
And then there's songs we were like,
shut this stupid fucking nonsense down.

628
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,080
Right?
Yeah.

629
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,080
It's like there's this pop musicy
plastic hollow,

630
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:04,800
empty bullshit that also has a lot of
those same words in it,

631
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,000
right?
Like what is the difference?

632
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,100
And that millions of people like,
yeah,

633
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,660
yeah,
but they're dumb as fuck.

634
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,720
Well that's,
but it's the same thing.

635
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,780
You've got all these people that is
still buy into the Horse Shit.

636
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,630
Yeah.
There is a big herd of people out there

637
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:21,400
that you can,
if you just start doing,

638
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:25,750
if Chris just stopping and convenient
started posting videos like that all the

639
00:30:25,751 --> 00:30:26,351
time.
Oh,

640
00:30:26,351 --> 00:30:27,850
he would kick out.
Just get followers.

641
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,350
Well,
if he really wanted to,

642
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:32,320
if deleah really wanted to be an
inspirational guy,

643
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,030
he's a handsome fella.

644
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,640
He's got a great voice.
He's got a lot of energy.

645
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:37,871
He's,
he's,

646
00:30:37,871 --> 00:30:39,160
you know,
he's dynamic.

647
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:40,590
He could do that.
It.

648
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,700
Yep.
He could do something like that if you

649
00:30:42,701 --> 00:30:43,810
want me to.
Kevin,

650
00:30:43,811 --> 00:30:45,550
the same thing.
The thing is though,

651
00:30:45,551 --> 00:30:49,630
Chris can do other things.
A lot of these inspirational fucks,

652
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:53,710
they really can't do things right.
They're not doing anything right.

653
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,590
They're not producing any great works.
They're not,

654
00:30:56,591 --> 00:31:00,190
they're not doing any interesting art.
They're not creating any interesting

655
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,800
music.
They're not making any funny comedy.

656
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,200
What they're doing is just trying to
like,

657
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,240
you know,
there's a lot of people out there that

658
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:09,130
don't think they can do it,
but you can.

659
00:31:09,131 --> 00:31:12,640
It's in you.
It's a flower that must be watered with

660
00:31:12,641 --> 00:31:15,070
the love of the gods and like,
yeah,

661
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,030
oh,
you can't,

662
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,490
there's so many of them.
They're overwhelming.

663
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,390
They are,
but so their business is not getting

664
00:31:22,391 --> 00:31:24,340
money from you necessarily.

665
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:29,530
Their business is in you paying
attention to them and then as you pay

666
00:31:29,531 --> 00:31:31,780
attention to them and to their social
media,

667
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:36,880
their social media page grows and then
they can do like speeches at these.

668
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,780
Have you seen no self help conferences?
Some people go on boats,

669
00:31:40,781 --> 00:31:43,870
they get,
they go go on a cruise ship and the ship

670
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:46,090
is just giving different kinds of
advice.

671
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,010
Yeah.
Peaches and everyone get in here,

672
00:31:48,011 --> 00:31:51,340
we're going to have a session and see
and he,

673
00:31:51,341 --> 00:31:52,840
you know,
and it does help people,

674
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:55,330
like there are people that they do help.
Yes,

675
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:56,790
true.
Some of it works.

676
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,960
I mean if you're,
if you're lost and you're just,

677
00:31:58,961 --> 00:32:01,510
you don't know what's going on and
you're been a loser for a while and you

678
00:32:01,511 --> 00:32:03,360
take a couple of his tips.
Yeah.

679
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,180
And you start working and writing shit
down and go in and have some self

680
00:32:07,181 --> 00:32:09,280
confidence,
it can help your life.

681
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:14,310
But there's some of these guys that all
they're doing is just trying to like

682
00:32:14,981 --> 00:32:18,550
figure out a way to give people advice
when they've never done shit themselves.

683
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,320
Yeah.
And that did not,

684
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:24,670
it's not worth listening to,
but yet they're there and they're there,

685
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,510
but it's the way it,
but is that any worse than an open miker

686
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,820
right.
Is it,

687
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,350
I mean,
if someone now,

688
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,870
but I want to do is,
I'm sorry if someone says,

689
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:36,970
what I want to do is I want to become a
motivational speaker.

690
00:32:36,971 --> 00:32:39,320
I want to really help people.
I want to really touch people,

691
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,600
but right now I kinda suck at it.
It's like you don't,

692
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,940
you don't just start out as Tony
Robbins.

693
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:44,720
No,
that's right.

694
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,610
Yeah.
You're just starting and it's like a

695
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:48,860
trainer.
It's like a bright boxing trainers never

696
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:51,330
really want to fight.
It could just be like an old guy who's

697
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,700
just some of those guys.

698
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,020
Most of them in fact a former fighters.
But are they?

699
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,480
Yeah.
It's very rare that someone's a boxing

700
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:01,370
tracking sales guy.
What?

701
00:33:01,371 --> 00:33:02,300
Freddie Roach.
Yeah.

702
00:33:02,301 --> 00:33:03,440
It was a good boxer.
Yeah.

703
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,330
He's a famous professional.
Oh yeah.

704
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,100
Yeah.
He's got Parkinson's because of it.

705
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,090
Oh really?
Yeah.

706
00:33:08,091 --> 00:33:11,630
He's got trauma related Parkinson's
disease from his time in the,

707
00:33:11,631 --> 00:33:13,940
in the ring Angelo Dundee.
He fought,

708
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,360
um,
uh,

709
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,070
shit.
Uh,

710
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,630
what the fuck's his day name?
The Puerto Rican guy.

711
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:25,640
Hagler Hector Camacho.
Camacho.

712
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,960
Yeah.
He fought Camacho.

713
00:33:26,961 --> 00:33:29,540
He fought a lot like big name guys.
Wow.

714
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,610
He,
he was a big deal.

715
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,710
Like in terms of like journeymen
fighters.

716
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,220
Freddie,
Freddie Roach was and his,

717
00:33:36,221 --> 00:33:40,250
his brother Pepper Roach is also a known
guy in the world of boxing.

718
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,380
Yeah.
Freddie was legit legit guy.

719
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,070
He was a legit pro.
Are there trainers that just train

720
00:33:46,071 --> 00:33:49,390
people that they just became trainers
and boxers?

721
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,860
They definitely have some experience.

722
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,560
Usually they have some amateur fights or
they,

723
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:58,580
it's very,
very rare that someone becomes,

724
00:33:58,581 --> 00:34:03,581
I respected boxing trainer without
having any competition experience just

725
00:34:03,771 --> 00:34:06,140
doesn't seem to make any sense.
Some of them,

726
00:34:06,141 --> 00:34:09,980
they realize early on that they're
better at coaching than they are

727
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,380
competing.
Whether it's because of physical

728
00:34:12,381 --> 00:34:14,420
dynamics or whether it's uh,
you know,

729
00:34:14,421 --> 00:34:17,000
they just don't like getting hit,
you know,

730
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,810
they know the limits or some people just
are really good at teaching others.

731
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,600
Yeah,
that's a,

732
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,590
that's a weird thing too.
And the world of Jujitsu,

733
00:34:24,591 --> 00:34:28,300
it's very common because a,
in Jujitsu there's a lot of people that

734
00:34:28,301 --> 00:34:32,430
get really good at understanding and um,
like one of the guys,

735
00:34:32,431 --> 00:34:35,240
it's going to be here next week.
John Danaher is world famous for it.

736
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:38,900
Yeah.
He's very famous for being like one of

737
00:34:38,901 --> 00:34:41,360
the greatest coaches in Jujitsu of all
time,

738
00:34:41,361 --> 00:34:43,580
but as boy,
as far as I know,

739
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,640
very little experience in terms of
actual competition.

740
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,410
Oh yeah.
But he's as he's kosher.

741
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,360
Yeah.
Unparalleled.

742
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,640
He's like universally regarded as one of
the great coaches alive.

743
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,800
That's impressive.
Yeah.

744
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,550
I got my 12 year old,
a uh,

745
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,980
a heavy bag Christmas.
Yeah.

746
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,210
You should,
uh,

747
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,890
just wrapping her hands.
He's got gloves.

748
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,660
Teach.
Get someone to teach her how to do it

749
00:35:05,661 --> 00:35:06,121
correctly.
Yeah.

750
00:35:06,121 --> 00:35:07,690
My Buddy Matt is coming over to,
oh,

751
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,730
he's a trainer.
He worked on their Angelo Dundee for

752
00:35:10,731 --> 00:35:14,360
awhile and open his own gym.
My good buddy Matt Bay Monte and he's

753
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:17,360
going to come my teacher on Thursday.
That's good.

754
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,320
Yeah,
it's pretty cool.

755
00:35:18,321 --> 00:35:19,970
It's a good way to get out aggression
too.

756
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,490
That's why he got it for,
she would just get angry.

757
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:25,190
She'd be doing schoolwork and be like,
this is bullshit.

758
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,080
And I'm like,
and she's like,

759
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:28,600
I want to be,
I want to punch something.

760
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,980
She started like punching pillows once
in a while.

761
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,490
So now we got her a bag.
You're,

762
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,180
what,
how much of you is Italian?

763
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,220
Um,
all of it's Italian except

764
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,130
for my one grandfather was German.
Angry people.

765
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,200
The Germans or the talented 10th Bolt
Sicilian Italian Sicilian is the

766
00:35:46,201 --> 00:35:50,460
dominant part is a little temporary.
People are jeans.

767
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,080
Yeah.
Fucking feed knuckle sandwiches to

768
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,120
people.
Really tough.

769
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,790
She's just like this beautiful 12 year
old girl.

770
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:59,880
Just wants to punch my sister's that way
too.

771
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:03,420
I stopped dating Italian girls when I
was 21 last time.

772
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:04,740
Girl I dated.
He took a swing at me.

773
00:36:04,741 --> 00:36:05,574
I was like,
that.

774
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,730
I'm good.
Did you?

775
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,970
Yeah.
Did you deserve it?

776
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,770
Nope.
But I saw it coming.

777
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,510
I was like,
I was like,

778
00:36:12,511 --> 00:36:14,400
this is,
I can't believe this is happening.

779
00:36:14,401 --> 00:36:17,590
She's actually trying to punch me.
She's going to punch where they just can

780
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,070
make a bunch of me.
Like I saw her shoulder pull back.

781
00:36:20,071 --> 00:36:21,600
I'm like,
there's no way this is actually

782
00:36:21,601 --> 00:36:22,460
happening.
Yeah.

783
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,083
Yeah.
No.

784
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,220
It gets fighting at the time.

785
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:29,220
So I was used to people punching me.
So as she's pulling her shoulder back

786
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:29,961
and Mike,
this camp,

787
00:36:29,961 --> 00:36:32,670
we were really happening.
I don't believe this is happening.

788
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,320
Oh my God,
it's happening.

789
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:38,040
It's not content.
It's funny,

790
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,620
but I think she just wanted attention.
I don't think she actually,

791
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,470
I think she's pretty sure that it wasn't
going to land.

792
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,870
You know that if she threw a punch at me
that I was just going to,

793
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,490
cause it's just really wanted to hurt
me.

794
00:36:47,491 --> 00:36:49,110
She fucking hit me when I wasn't
looking.

795
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,850
You know?
That's what people do.

796
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,980
They don't just look right at you and
you motherfucker.

797
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,880
But then again,
when people are in the height of some

798
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:00,000
sort of fucking Sicilian love rage.
Right,

799
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:01,680
exactly.
You don't want to mess with that

800
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,860
screaming and the yelling and the
throwing things around.

801
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,750
That's also very east coast.

802
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,030
Oh yeah.
I've talked about this ad Nauseum,

803
00:37:09,031 --> 00:37:13,290
but I really believe that that's the
echoes of those fucking barbarians that

804
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:15,540
came over on boats from Europe.
Yeah.

805
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:18,090
And didn't even know what America looked
like.

806
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,290
No.
Did he knew to have a photo to look at

807
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:24,690
and these fucking cave people pulled up
on rafts and start a fucking,

808
00:37:24,691 --> 00:37:29,600
immediately they started baking bread,
rolling up pasta bagging.

809
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,020
Hey,
I got bread for both of you.

810
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,461
You brought up.
Oh,

811
00:37:32,461 --> 00:37:33,750
you too.
You have to lows.

812
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,180
You're an animal,
Tom.

813
00:37:36,181 --> 00:37:38,550
Papa God amongst man.
There you go.

814
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,760
This is for you.
Do you,

815
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,790
do you need,
I've never given you the bread.

816
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:44,100
I never give Jamie the brand.
I'm like he's probably gonna appreciate

817
00:37:44,101 --> 00:37:45,390
it.
How long will this stay?

818
00:37:45,391 --> 00:37:47,190
Good.
Because Sunday's my cheat day.

819
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,510
Sunday.
Yeah,

820
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,520
you'll be good.
And where are we or should I just use

821
00:37:50,521 --> 00:37:50,850
days?

822
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:55,250
Pawn my cheat day or move it to today.
If you keep it in paper,

823
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,140
it'll wait.
We'll have to toast it out to eat it

824
00:37:58,141 --> 00:38:00,780
today is the best way to eat it today or
tomorrow?

825
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:02,400
Actually tomorrow.
Thursday.

826
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,990
Better.
Yeah.

827
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,910
Why is it better?
Cause it just came out.

828
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,980
Ooh.
So it's not good right away.

829
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,630
It is.
It's if you want that warm.

830
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,180
It is,
but really it's,

831
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,760
it gets even better a day after,
you know,

832
00:38:14,761 --> 00:38:17,550
that's the case with tuna.
I did not know that.

833
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,320
I always thought that if you bought
Sushi,

834
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:22,380
you're supposed to get fresh Sushi and
just pulled it out of the wire.

835
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,700
They're going to slice it up for you
right now.

836
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,430
But no.
If you go to like a real master Sushi

837
00:38:26,431 --> 00:38:28,500
maker,
that Sushi sits.

838
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,490
Oh,
really?

839
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,690
Yeah.
For how long?

840
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,880
Fucking week.
Sometimes.

841
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,200
I know just the tutor.

842
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:37,480
I watched some documentary on some Sushi
master.

843
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,343
Oh,
the hero?

844
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,221
No,
it wasn't that.

845
00:38:39,221 --> 00:38:40,810
It wasn't that guy,
but that guy.

846
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,440
That's a great one too.
It's really good.

847
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,110
I was like,
somebody's,

848
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:49,290
what we're talking about is a g row was
that I tased him hero or zero euro.

849
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,540
Jiro or a euro.
How do you say it though?

850
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:55,260
Do you know?
But it's spelled with a j.

851
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,330
Let's say Jiro.
Jiro dreams of Sushi.

852
00:38:58,331 --> 00:38:59,980
I was like,
I'm not going to watch a fucking

853
00:38:59,981 --> 00:39:04,500
documentary on a Chi.
Makes Sushi fish a fish to the rice up.

854
00:39:04,501 --> 00:39:05,350
You're done,
dude.

855
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,280
Yeah.
Okay.

856
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,630
Give me some edamame.
Miami would kick this.

857
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,320
He started saying like some complicated
casserole that you're putting together,

858
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,400
you know?
Yeah,

859
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,590
but wow.
You Watch it and go,

860
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:15,483
oh,
okay.

861
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,050
I'm ignorant.
This guy's an artist.

862
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,310
Yeah.
There's way more to this.

863
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,120
Oh my God.

864
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,640
His whole soul is in it and it comes
out.

865
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,200
Yeah.
Amazing.

866
00:39:23,201 --> 00:39:25,990
He's tiny ass little restaurant.
That's about the size of this room.

867
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,090
No interest in getting bigger.
Nope,

868
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,470
no franchising.
Nope.

869
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,050
Just doing this so well that people are
going to,

870
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,460
are going to come.
There's something to that man.

871
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:36,480
Oh,
it's the best.

872
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,020
I'm doing one thing really well.
Like God,

873
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,480
it's the best.
There's something,

874
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:44,740
there's definitely something to that.
There's something to especially like

875
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:48,850
the,
the mindset of every day trying to learn

876
00:39:48,851 --> 00:39:53,500
how to make that egg dish perfect.
That one egg dish that one guy said he'd

877
00:39:53,501 --> 00:39:55,960
worked on for a year.
It's crazy.

878
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,310
A fucking year.
And the eggs,

879
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:01,420
all that just completely doing it over
and over and over.

880
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,070
My bread thing is not I,
it's probably like you're both thing,

881
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:09,100
the bread thing.
It's like you do just start to like

882
00:40:09,101 --> 00:40:12,610
focus on this one thing and trying to do
it well and you just start to get,

883
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,110
it becomes a part of you.

884
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:18,580
You're starting to put yourself into it.
It's not just making bread,

885
00:40:18,581 --> 00:40:20,440
it's there.
It is a practice.

886
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:23,770
It is something that for a couple of
years I've just kind of gone down that

887
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,760
wormhole.
Yeah,

888
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,760
it's a good thing.
The worm.

889
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:31,180
Yeah.
Doing that one thing I really,

890
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:36,240
I feel like that sometimes with with
standup it's like we've all these other

891
00:40:37,181 --> 00:40:39,940
things that are always going on and
pulling us in different directions and

892
00:40:39,941 --> 00:40:43,750
stuff and it's like if you could just
focus purely on just if that was the

893
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:46,030
only,
if you weren't taking any phone calls on

894
00:40:46,031 --> 00:40:48,450
anything else,
you weren't podcasts and you weren't

895
00:40:48,451 --> 00:40:51,370
writing scripts,
you weren't appearing on whatever,

896
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,590
like would that make a difference?
Like would you be yes and no because I

897
00:40:56,591 --> 00:41:00,520
think that we're,
it requires a certain amount of

898
00:41:00,521 --> 00:41:03,370
dedication and a certain amount of time
on stage,

899
00:41:03,371 --> 00:41:06,760
but I think it also requires certain
amount of living.

900
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:12,570
I think you need to do other things and
although podcasting seems like a job and

901
00:41:14,201 --> 00:41:17,920
a distraction,
one thing it is unquestionably is

902
00:41:17,921 --> 00:41:20,650
exploration.
It's an exploration of ideas,

903
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,530
right?
At an unprecedented level.

904
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:26,440
Like you're,
you're exploring ideas without looking

905
00:41:26,441 --> 00:41:27,850
at your phone,
without talk.

906
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:30,400
You just,
you and I are talking to three hours.

907
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:33,190
When does that ever happen in life?
Yeah.

908
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,340
No it doesn't.

909
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:38,750
There's a lot of ideas that I come up
with through stand up or in standup that

910
00:41:38,751 --> 00:41:39,980
came out of podcasts.
Oh,

911
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:40,990
sure.
Yeah,

912
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:41,930
yeah,
yeah.

913
00:41:41,931 --> 00:41:43,700
Your mind's active.
Yeah.

914
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:47,730
So I think that that writing similar
writings,

915
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,460
oh yeah.
Same kind of a thing.

916
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,820
Yeah.
But I also think doing stuff is

917
00:41:52,821 --> 00:41:55,490
important too.
Not just the actual sit down talking

918
00:41:55,491 --> 00:41:58,100
part of your podcast,
but actually going places,

919
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:01,160
being active.
You have to experience things.

920
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,040
You have to watch documentaries.
You have to go to a museum,

921
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:07,220
you have to go see things.
He got to go talk to people.

922
00:42:07,221 --> 00:42:09,800
You've got to go on adventures.
Got To go travel.

923
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:11,060
It's filling up the,
well,

924
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:11,913
yeah.
This,

925
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,770
you have to think of your brain almost
like your crossfit,

926
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,310
not crossfit.
Uh,

927
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,190
what's that?
What's that word?

928
00:42:19,191 --> 00:42:22,340
Where you a
cross training?

929
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:25,700
I guess that's what I'm looking for when
you're doing a bunch of different kinds

930
00:42:25,701 --> 00:42:27,250
of multitasking that will,
no,

931
00:42:27,251 --> 00:42:27,740
no,
no.

932
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:31,370
Different types of athletic,
athletic activities that will enhance

933
00:42:31,371 --> 00:42:33,320
your sport if you play hockey,
right.

934
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:37,310
You don't just do hockey.
You also are involved in the box jumps.

935
00:42:37,311 --> 00:42:38,540
You're doing a lot of,
uh,

936
00:42:38,541 --> 00:42:39,850
you know,
sprinting up hill,

937
00:42:39,851 --> 00:42:41,060
it's a good way to look at it.
Yeah.

938
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:46,430
These all these things enhance this one
activity and it's not just all you have

939
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:50,900
to do is just skate all day and you'll
become the best skater while you may be,

940
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,640
or you could get better at the motions
of skating by strengthening your legs

941
00:42:55,641 --> 00:43:00,290
with weightlifting or doing this and you
can accelerate your curve by doing yoga

942
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:01,124
or you could,
you know,

943
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:05,150
I think that that there's something to
that with comedy,

944
00:43:05,151 --> 00:43:05,984
at least for,

945
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:06,921
yeah,
no,

946
00:43:06,921 --> 00:43:07,581
I agree.
I mean,

947
00:43:07,581 --> 00:43:10,400
when I'm really actively writing other
stuff,

948
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:13,580
whether it's scripts or whatever,
uh,

949
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,170
my writing for standup improves does.
Yeah.

950
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,100
Yeah.
And reading,

951
00:43:19,101 --> 00:43:20,300
by the way,
reading,

952
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:24,410
writing stuff,
it all feeds the act.

953
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:26,960
When you,
when you then shift your focus over

954
00:43:26,961 --> 00:43:28,640
here,
back to the act,

955
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:34,240
you're better because of that stuff.
But I do sometimes think like the Sushi

956
00:43:34,851 --> 00:43:36,080
guy,
like,

957
00:43:36,081 --> 00:43:39,110
but what if the output was only geared
towards that?

958
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,550
The input I get doing all that stuff.
But would there be a difference?

959
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,680
Maybe.
I mean,

960
00:43:44,681 --> 00:43:46,630
maybe there's something to that.
I mean,

961
00:43:46,631 --> 00:43:48,240
I don't know.
I don't know anybody who does that way

962
00:43:48,241 --> 00:43:49,074
though.

963
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,560
Well,
maybe at him.

964
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,970
Yeah.
But Regan plays golf and drinks and does

965
00:43:55,971 --> 00:43:58,850
a lot of other shit,
but he's not creating other art.

966
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:01,130
He's not writing scripts.
He's not,

967
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,000
he also doesn't.
Right,

968
00:44:02,001 --> 00:44:03,200
right,
right.

969
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:08,060
He writes like cutting his head and then
it goes on stage and works on stuff.

970
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:09,530
Right?
Yeah.

971
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:12,890
Yeah.
Which I'm torn on.

972
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:14,320
I mean,
I know it's,

973
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:17,840
it's a very effective,
some people do it amazingly well and

974
00:44:17,841 --> 00:44:19,970
that's how they've created incredible
works of art.

975
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:23,000
But I never give that advice.
Whenever anyone asks me,

976
00:44:23,001 --> 00:44:24,020
I say,
you should do both.

977
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,410
You should write down things and you
should write on a computer.

978
00:44:27,411 --> 00:44:28,190
You should.
Right.

979
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:31,620
Or however you like to write,
but you should also fuck around on

980
00:44:31,621 --> 00:44:32,910
stage.
You should do both.

981
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:33,870
Yeah.
That's what I think.

982
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:34,411
Yeah.
No,

983
00:44:34,411 --> 00:44:37,920
I do too.
I can't just show up on stage and hope

984
00:44:37,921 --> 00:44:38,754
it's going to happen.

985
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:40,860
Well,
here's some ideas that I've had that

986
00:44:40,861 --> 00:44:45,861
I'll like literally like have in my car
and then I'll bounce them around by

987
00:44:46,471 --> 00:44:49,440
myself a little bit and not having ever
written them down.

988
00:44:49,441 --> 00:44:53,490
I'll go onstage and then it'll just
catch fire and it will become a bit,

989
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,940
and there's some bits that have made it
to specials that I've never even written

990
00:44:56,941 --> 00:44:59,400
down.
I just knew how to do them because I did

991
00:44:59,401 --> 00:45:02,580
them a bunch of times.
And most of them,

992
00:45:02,581 --> 00:45:04,560
not though,
most of them not,

993
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:09,830
or at least I always feel like I'll
bring an idea up on stage that hasn't

994
00:45:11,371 --> 00:45:14,070
been written down yet.
There's something there,

995
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:18,390
there's something going on,
but then I bring it back to the shop and

996
00:45:18,391 --> 00:45:20,340
we'll play with it.
And then,

997
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:22,230
then it becomes this back and forth.
Yeah.

998
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,000
Like,
here's what one example,

999
00:45:24,001 --> 00:45:26,220
this is a bit that I,
I bounced around,

1000
00:45:26,221 --> 00:45:31,221
I was thinking about in the car and then
I brought it onto stage in a completed

1001
00:45:31,621 --> 00:45:34,980
form and it never really changed.
It's a bit about,

1002
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,120
uh,
big foot.

1003
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,820
I said,
here's what you don't find.

1004
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:41,910
When you go looking for bigfoot black
people,

1005
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,520
like you're more likely to find big
foot.

1006
00:45:44,521 --> 00:45:49,521
Then you are black people looking for
bigfoot and just fine hordes of

1007
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:52,810
unfuckable white dudes out camping.
That's what she fine.

1008
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,560
That's,
that's how it goes.

1009
00:45:55,561 --> 00:45:56,850
Looking for bigfoot.
You're not,

1010
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,880
you don't find it's not African American
pastime and that that bit came out in

1011
00:46:03,841 --> 00:46:07,890
the car.
I made myself laugh and then it never

1012
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:09,810
changed.
It just became that.

1013
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:11,670
I don't think I ever wrote it down
anywhere.

1014
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:16,680
Hated it into my 2014 comedy central
special.

1015
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,010
That's a little,
but that's rare.

1016
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:21,690
Those are the rare ones.
It is rare,

1017
00:46:21,691 --> 00:46:23,700
but man,
it'd be nice if they were all came that

1018
00:46:23,701 --> 00:46:26,340
way.
Yeah.

1019
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:27,600
It's been a few.
They're usually,

1020
00:46:27,601 --> 00:46:29,820
for some reason they're one liners to
like that.

1021
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,580
He's so funny.
It's just complete.

1022
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,050
Yeah.
Some of them are just,

1023
00:46:34,051 --> 00:46:35,880
they just formed themselves complete.

1024
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,360
It's just a bowser best too.
When you makes you laugh.

1025
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:43,750
Yeah,
like there's things that you've just

1026
00:46:43,751 --> 00:46:44,471
thinking your head.
Yeah.

1027
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:46,480
That's pretty funny.
There's a funny thing and then you bring

1028
00:46:46,481 --> 00:46:48,130
it up on stage and it becomes really
funny,

1029
00:46:48,131 --> 00:46:51,160
but when it really just truly makes you
laugh,

1030
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,840
then you,
it's such a,

1031
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:53,940
that's great.
Yeah,

1032
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:54,990
it is great.
When there's

1033
00:46:55,270 --> 00:47:00,180
thing that he just clicks to the point
where you just start giggling,

1034
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:02,530
get the fuck out of here.
Yeah.

1035
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:04,270
Those are my favorite kind of jokes

1036
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:04,981
keep.
Yeah,

1037
00:47:04,981 --> 00:47:06,270
because it's,
that's what,

1038
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:10,470
that's why you started making people
laugh as a kid in the first place was

1039
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:13,740
just having fun.
And sometimes as an adult you've got all

1040
00:47:13,741 --> 00:47:17,100
this other stuff in your head.
It's like you do have to kind of remind

1041
00:47:17,101 --> 00:47:18,330
yourself,
this is fun.

1042
00:47:18,331 --> 00:47:23,160
This is silly shit.
They should be giggle enjoyable,

1043
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,151
you know?
Yeah.

1044
00:47:24,151 --> 00:47:25,310
It should be.
Yeah,

1045
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,440
it should be.
Sometimes it can be,

1046
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:28,410
feel like,
you know,

1047
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,910
because it out of writing,
the other stuff that does come out of

1048
00:47:30,911 --> 00:47:33,340
writing,
writing can be a grind.

1049
00:47:33,341 --> 00:47:35,290
Writing is insular.
It's by yourself.

1050
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:39,670
You're just in there alone doing,
it's not this joyful place.

1051
00:47:39,671 --> 00:47:42,290
Most of the time you're not,
you're not writing like,

1052
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:44,800
but it's not painful.
So painful.

1053
00:47:44,801 --> 00:47:47,170
But it's,
but it is a practice that is different

1054
00:47:47,171 --> 00:47:50,050
than just being with your buddies.
Talking about big foot.

1055
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:51,021
Yes.
Yeah.

1056
00:47:51,021 --> 00:47:51,780
No.
Yeah,

1057
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,520
that's,
those are the fun ones,

1058
00:47:53,521 --> 00:47:55,560
right?
The big foot ones are the ones that come

1059
00:47:55,561 --> 00:47:58,010
out of nowhere with no effort and they
kill and like,

1060
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:02,650
I got this for free.
It's like got some crazy scape or the

1061
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,600
not worried about damaging cars and work
on it for a hundred years.

1062
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:07,463
Yeah.

1063
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,280
No writing's not painful,
but there is a thing,

1064
00:48:10,281 --> 00:48:13,370
there is a mental part where you,
if you're,

1065
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:16,670
if you're ever like put it down for a
while and don't do it,

1066
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,700
it's like you gotta get your head back
into the space of doing it.

1067
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:22,460
That could be a little painful.
It's that hard.

1068
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:23,743
I don't know.

1069
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:26,430
It is,
but I don't know if you ever read,

1070
00:48:26,431 --> 00:48:29,340
um,
Steven Pressfield's book the war of art.

1071
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:30,750
No,
it's excellent.

1072
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:34,680
It's so good that I bought stacks of it
and I used to hand it out to people on

1073
00:48:34,681 --> 00:48:35,880
the podcast.
Oh really?

1074
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:38,760
Yeah.
Because I think most people like when

1075
00:48:38,761 --> 00:48:40,560
you say it,
like if someone says like what's the

1076
00:48:40,561 --> 00:48:44,610
difference between guys who get things
done and guys who go don't get things

1077
00:48:44,611 --> 00:48:45,444
done.
Yeah,

1078
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:50,310
this sounds so stupid simple.
But the people that get things done do

1079
00:48:50,311 --> 00:48:52,080
things.
You actually do it.

1080
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,200
They sit down and do it and there's
something about the people that don't

1081
00:48:55,201 --> 00:48:57,060
get things done that stops them from
doing that.

1082
00:48:57,061 --> 00:49:01,590
Like what is it?
And pressfield calls it resistance.

1083
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:06,990
And what he says is that you have to,
you have to overcome resistance because

1084
00:49:06,991 --> 00:49:10,290
that's where professionals do you sit
down because you,

1085
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:15,410
you have affirmed that you are a pro and
you sit down and you go over what you

1086
00:49:15,721 --> 00:49:16,830
are going to do.

1087
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:19,670
This is what I do.
I A professional I've,

1088
00:49:19,671 --> 00:49:20,450
right,
right.

1089
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:23,520
And I'm going to sit down and I'm going
to write and I'm going to summon the

1090
00:49:23,521 --> 00:49:24,760
Muse and the Muse,
any,

1091
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:28,890
whether the muse is a real thing or not
and he treats it as it's as it's a real

1092
00:49:28,891 --> 00:49:31,170
thing.
And the concept is that you are going to

1093
00:49:31,171 --> 00:49:36,171
summon this thing that you call upon to
endow you with creativity and that doing

1094
00:49:36,721 --> 00:49:38,200
the work by doing the work.
Yeah.

1095
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:43,290
And then that overcoming this resistance
is the war of art and um,

1096
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:46,470
yeah,
that's what is the resistance then?

1097
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:49,830
That's the question.
It's my negative thoughts really.

1098
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:51,790
What's,
it's not just negative thoughts.

1099
00:49:51,791 --> 00:49:54,030
It's resisting work.
It's,

1100
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:56,040
it's not negative in this.
It's like,

1101
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,050
it's weird.
You're like,

1102
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,230
something's po stopping you from
succeeding.

1103
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:06,450
Something stopping you from,
from pushing forward and putting down

1104
00:50:06,451 --> 00:50:07,470
those ideas

1105
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,140
you want the easy,
you want to just sit on the couch.

1106
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:14,970
Like in my office,
I have a couch and I have a desk and the

1107
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:15,804
couch,
I said,

1108
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,040
you know,
nothing gets done.

1109
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:20,220
Nothing gets done on the couch.
Really.

1110
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,560
It's,
it's,

1111
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:25,680
it's about sitting there.
There was this great a quote from this

1112
00:50:25,681 --> 00:50:29,300
Israeli writer who I,
every time I'd say the quote I say,

1113
00:50:29,301 --> 00:50:32,930
I always forget what his name was and I
should know it because he used the

1114
00:50:32,931 --> 00:50:36,110
quotes so often,
but he says that writing and the job of

1115
00:50:36,111 --> 00:50:40,880
being a writer is the same as being a
shopkeeper and it's your job to go and

1116
00:50:40,881 --> 00:50:44,690
open the shop every day and some days
nothing happens.

1117
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:48,470
Some day you're just sitting in the shop
like an idiot behind the desk and

1118
00:50:48,471 --> 00:50:53,471
nobody's there and then some days the
shop is buzzing with action and activity

1119
00:50:54,441 --> 00:50:56,780
and people in and out and stuff is
happening.

1120
00:50:57,110 --> 00:51:01,640
But all of those days when it's really
busy and active does not happen unless

1121
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:06,260
you opened the shop every day.
It's such an easy way for my brain to

1122
00:51:06,261 --> 00:51:08,180
kind of think of it.
That's a brilliant way of putting it.

1123
00:51:08,181 --> 00:51:12,380
Just go and sit down at the place where
you do the work and start doing the

1124
00:51:12,381 --> 00:51:13,880
work.
He may not be great.

1125
00:51:13,881 --> 00:51:16,700
That's not up to you.
If it's going to be great,

1126
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:20,330
it's up to you whether or not you sit
down and start working.

1127
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,090
Have you ever,

1128
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:23,070
I read Stephen King's on writing.
Yeah,

1129
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,450
that's great.
That was a good one.

1130
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:29,530
Those are my two go to books when I'm
feeling like I need something to

1131
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:30,790
recharge.

1132
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:33,070
Jan would be a good one to go back to.
And you know,

1133
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:36,450
I read that one like a long time ago and
uh,

1134
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,980
his just thing of you just like what
you're saying,

1135
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:42,130
you just have to do it.
You just have to do,

1136
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:42,670
right.

1137
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:43,970
Yeah.
I mean there's,

1138
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:49,150
there's days that I'll go and I'll write
for fucking hours and literally get

1139
00:51:49,581 --> 00:51:51,620
nothing out of it.
There's nothing there.

1140
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,640
Nothing,
nothing.

1141
00:51:52,641 --> 00:51:56,480
It's all bullshit and then nothing.
And if you judge yourself by that,

1142
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:57,171
you'd go like,
Hey,

1143
00:51:57,171 --> 00:51:59,050
I'm a fucking terrible writer.
Yeah.

1144
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:04,130
Stink.
And then one day you'll just sit down

1145
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,740
and then you have your next 10 minutes.
You're like,

1146
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:08,900
oh boy,
there's something here.

1147
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:10,370
I got here,
I got something here.

1148
00:52:10,371 --> 00:52:11,240
I got it.
Sparks.

1149
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,710
Yeah,
because you showed up.

1150
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:15,500
Speaking of sparks.
Did you hear about this fucking bird

1151
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,520
that they found that starts fires?
No.

1152
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:24,550
They found a hawk that picks up burning
embers and sticks that are on fire and s

1153
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:31,660
flies them across rivers and creeks to
start the fires on the other side so

1154
00:52:32,061 --> 00:52:34,850
that it could force a game animals to
run away.

1155
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,770
Wow.
Brilliant.

1156
00:52:36,771 --> 00:52:39,470
Took of this.
Birds of prey are starting fires,

1157
00:52:39,471 --> 00:52:44,060
deliberately kites and foulk.
I didn't know kite was a bird.

1158
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:48,860
Kites and Falcons are intentionally
dropping smoldering twigs to smoke out

1159
00:52:48,861 --> 00:52:52,130
mice and insects in Australia.
Jesus Christ.

1160
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:53,900
Geez.
Louise.

1161
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:58,130
Researchers of compile the study of
reports of wild bird spreading fires.

1162
00:52:58,131 --> 00:53:01,670
They believe the birds carry these
burning twigs to unburnt parts of the

1163
00:53:01,671 --> 00:53:04,730
Bush and the birds dropped them in a bid
to smoke out,

1164
00:53:04,731 --> 00:53:05,241
pray,
blah,

1165
00:53:05,241 --> 00:53:06,074
blah,
blah.

1166
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:08,320
They also smoke three packs a day.

1167
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:11,090
What does it say?
The researchers said birds.

1168
00:53:11,091 --> 00:53:15,530
Could you see the third force capable of
starting bushfires?

1169
00:53:15,531 --> 00:53:16,990
That's incredible.
There's,

1170
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:18,170
it's clever.
Yeah,

1171
00:53:18,171 --> 00:53:20,300
there's so,
there's so irresponsible.

1172
00:53:20,301 --> 00:53:23,270
He's fuck,
I don't give a shit about fires and they

1173
00:53:23,271 --> 00:53:24,330
fly away like,
wow,

1174
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:26,760
fly where fire isn't.
I got a mouse.

1175
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:30,850
All neighborhoods burnt down,
but he got a mouse snacks,

1176
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:36,600
cheese,
Douche bags.

1177
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:41,610
Did you see that chicken that the
researchers created that accidentally

1178
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,520
somehow or another through when they put
it together,

1179
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:46,860
um,
had the face of a dinosaur.

1180
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:48,810
Have you seen this?
No.

1181
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:50,760
Yeah,
we'll see if you can find that on my,

1182
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:52,320
it's on my twitter,
but they made,

1183
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,510
they made chicken.
Don't know what the fuck they did.

1184
00:53:54,511 --> 00:53:57,570
Read it.
I briefly read the article.

1185
00:53:57,571 --> 00:54:01,010
I'm like these motherfuckers and then I
ran away but he got scared.

1186
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,560
He had to face is chicken as the face of
the fucking dinosaur.

1187
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:08,040
Get teeth.
It's a chicken with the dinosaurs face.

1188
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:11,280
So who got the dinosaur stuff?
Pull it up.

1189
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:16,370
Who got the dinosaur DNA and put it in
that oh no gross face of a dinosaur.

1190
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:20,490
What?
What's earth dude?

1191
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,940
I've been telling people forever because
of the fact that I keep chickens now.

1192
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:27,090
Chickens are fucking monsters.
They are monsters.

1193
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:29,940
They give good eggs though they do have
good eggs.

1194
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:35,090
But we have this idea of them as being
these cute little cuddly little fluffy

1195
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,360
things that lay eggs.
And just peck around now they're fucking

1196
00:54:39,361 --> 00:54:41,040
monsters.
Doesn't even pull up the,

1197
00:54:41,041 --> 00:54:41,481
uh,
the,

1198
00:54:41,481 --> 00:54:42,510
the,
the top of the article.

1199
00:54:42,511 --> 00:54:45,870
Jamie go to the top of and make it
larger so I could read it there.

1200
00:54:45,871 --> 00:54:47,280
So,
so what it says,

1201
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:47,731
blah,
blah,

1202
00:54:47,731 --> 00:54:49,140
blah.
Group of dinosaurs.

1203
00:54:49,141 --> 00:54:50,480
The idea,
I keep going,

1204
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:56,400
uh,
to understand how one change the other

1205
00:54:56,401 --> 00:54:58,650
team has been tampering with the
molecular process,

1206
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,380
um,
that make up a beacon chickens.

1207
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:03,330
By doing so,
they've managed to create a chicken

1208
00:55:03,331 --> 00:55:07,860
embryo with a dinosaur likes snout and a
palette similar to that of feathered

1209
00:55:07,861 --> 00:55:11,070
dinosaurs like Velossa raptor.
They're making raptors.

1210
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:14,940
The results are published in the journal
evolution.

1211
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:18,720
The team's aim was to understand how the
bird beak evolved because the beak is

1212
00:55:18,721 --> 00:55:21,090
such a vital part of birds and bird
anatomy.

1213
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,980
It's been crucial for their success to
10,000 or more.

1214
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:29,090
More species occupy a wide range of
habitats and many have specialized beaks

1215
00:55:29,611 --> 00:55:33,600
to help them survive.
So it mess the mess with them.

1216
00:55:33,601 --> 00:55:36,300
The neck,
molecular makeup of the beak.

1217
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:38,910
Yeah.
And he made a fucking dinosaur phase

1218
00:55:38,911 --> 00:55:40,850
chicken.
How long?

1219
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,570
I'll be good when they're running
around.

1220
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:45,300
That will be great when they're at the
petting zoo.

1221
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:48,300
I bet they would have better.
I bet they would have better eggs

1222
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:52,170
because like my chicken's eggs are
significantly better when I let them

1223
00:55:52,171 --> 00:55:55,440
loose and they go fuck up.
Like my,

1224
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,050
like they'll eat mice and they'll eat
worms,

1225
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,470
bugs,
bugs and then I'll get these dark yolks.

1226
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:04,560
Like the last couple of days they've
been running around my yard all day.

1227
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:05,870
So really?
Yeah.

1228
00:56:05,871 --> 00:56:10,320
So the exit I'll collect tonight or
tomorrow will be dark orange,

1229
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,900
but when they're sedentary,
they're lazy.

1230
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:14,940
They're just in the cage.
Um,

1231
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:17,130
well they have it.
They have a very large coupe.

1232
00:56:17,131 --> 00:56:21,240
The coupe is right.
The coop is essentially for the 19

1233
00:56:21,241 --> 00:56:23,620
chicken,
seven 17 now a of them died.

1234
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,460
17

1235
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:27,100
chickens I have,
it's basically the size of this room.

1236
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,910
So they all good space.
They got plenty of room to wander around

1237
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:34,330
and plenty of food.
But they like when you ever see

1238
00:56:34,331 --> 00:56:38,680
vegetarian raise chicken and vegetables
that they don't want that.

1239
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,400
Oh no,
that's just that.

1240
00:56:41,401 --> 00:56:42,910
They'll eat that if that's all you give
them.

1241
00:56:42,911 --> 00:56:46,830
But they won't eat,
they won't eat things like bugs.

1242
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,880
And worms.
That's most of it.

1243
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,230
But mice more than anything.
Mice,

1244
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:54,040
they found a mouse.
They fight for it.

1245
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:56,710
It's one of the few things that they
will fight for real?

1246
00:56:56,711 --> 00:56:57,521
Yeah.
One,

1247
00:56:57,521 --> 00:57:01,330
we'll grab the mouse and they will just
chase each other and try to fuck that

1248
00:57:01,331 --> 00:57:02,800
mouse up.
How are those eggs?

1249
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:06,730
Amazing.
It's hard to tell like who's laying the

1250
00:57:06,731 --> 00:57:08,210
eggs.
What do you do with all the exit eggs?

1251
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:09,940
This is a lot of them out to people.

1252
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,270
You can have some new ones in bags.
Yeah,

1253
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:11,921
sure.
I'll take some,

1254
00:57:11,921 --> 00:57:12,754
excuse me,
some eggs.

1255
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:14,860
I got to meet for you to come out of
elk.

1256
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:18,850
I got songs I really started to crave to
this year.

1257
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:20,050
Oh yeah,
I know.

1258
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:22,220
Alright.
Eh,

1259
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:24,820
that's a good serve it up.
Could he for the meet?

1260
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,240
Me and my,
my dog are so happy with the hell comes

1261
00:57:28,241 --> 00:57:29,110
out.
Yeah,

1262
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,440
I showed you a picture.
Did they send you a shot of Mike?

1263
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:34,390
You cooking?
I was cooking up the ground alk and the

1264
00:57:34,391 --> 00:57:36,280
dog is just like,
we're doing this right?

1265
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:40,620
Yeah.
Grass fed butter and ground elk,

1266
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:43,990
garlic salt.
It's really good.

1267
00:57:43,991 --> 00:57:47,980
With the eggs to and mix it up and eggs.
That's exactly what I do.

1268
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:50,470
Remember.
We put it on a little bit of the sour

1269
00:57:50,471 --> 00:57:53,380
dough bread.
Now you're thinking,

1270
00:57:53,381 --> 00:57:54,540
damn,
take the sourdough.

1271
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:57,430
You put a lot of butter on it.
Just use it as the base and put that on

1272
00:57:57,431 --> 00:57:59,740
top of it and then just cut it and eat
it.

1273
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:02,500
We need a friend with a vineyard.
Ooh,

1274
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:05,380
we had a friend who makes his own wine.
Yeah,

1275
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:07,960
it would be great.
We live in the right state for it.

1276
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:08,741
Oh,
I know.

1277
00:58:08,741 --> 00:58:10,240
I know a guy who does it.
You do?

1278
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:15,120
Ah,
I don't know.

1279
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,300
I never had his wine.
He gave me a bottle.

1280
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,880
What the fuck happened to it?
Oh yeah.

1281
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:24,690
Yeah.
It's a buddy of mine I can drink and

1282
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:27,320
he's in the real estate business.
I drank a lot of wines.

1283
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:28,850
Second half of the year.
Yeah,

1284
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:30,243
a lot.
Too much.

1285
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:32,740
I started reading fashion time.
No,

1286
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:38,740
but I'm not drinking for January.
The whole month off sober January.

1287
00:58:38,741 --> 00:58:40,240
My friend was,
my friend was like,

1288
00:58:40,241 --> 00:58:41,500
I'm just going to,
uh,

1289
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,470
I'm not,
we went out on the second and he's like,

1290
00:58:44,471 --> 00:58:45,220
no,
I'm not.

1291
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:46,780
I'm not drinking for the month of
January.

1292
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:48,400
And I was like,
that sounds good.

1293
00:58:48,401 --> 00:58:51,890
I'm going to do that to not thinking.
And uh,

1294
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,280
it's been a week and I'm like,
this is stupid.

1295
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,850
Which makes me think maybe it's not a
bad thing.

1296
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:03,100
I've never taken a whole month off since
I started drinking as a kid.

1297
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:06,320
You got to do sober October.
That's the move sober October.

1298
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,100
Yeah.
We all do it.

1299
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:07,933
Yeah.
Yeah.

1300
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:09,850
I dunno if everybody's going to do it
this year.

1301
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:11,650
I doubt we're going to get burke do it
again.

1302
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,920
Bert was in a part do with that frothy
panic.

1303
00:59:14,921 --> 00:59:17,940
What time November rolled around.
I was holy Shit.

1304
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:19,540
Look in his face.
You know where he was.

1305
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:21,590
Um,
he was getting his,

1306
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:24,800
uh,
his jollies he was going on instagram

1307
00:59:24,801 --> 00:59:28,400
feeds of people that were clearly losing
their fucking mind.

1308
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:29,593
Like,
oh

1309
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:34,520
no,
you'd send them to me like comedians or

1310
00:59:34,521 --> 00:59:37,190
other fucking minds.
He'd send them like a Cha,

1311
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:39,230
just just check out her instagram story.
I'm like,

1312
00:59:39,231 --> 00:59:41,090
you son of a bitch.
And I go there.

1313
00:59:41,091 --> 00:59:42,200
I'm like,
oh my God,

1314
00:59:42,201 --> 00:59:43,160
what have you done?
Oh,

1315
00:59:43,161 --> 00:59:44,840
not when I'm not drinking.
Just crazy.

1316
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:46,200
Just being crazy.
It's been crazy.

1317
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:50,090
There are some people out there and I
know I don't want to out them,

1318
00:59:50,091 --> 00:59:54,620
so I'll tell you off the air,
there are some people you find out about

1319
00:59:54,621 --> 00:59:56,450
their instagram story and you go,
oh,

1320
00:59:56,451 --> 00:59:58,550
there's a hidden little gem here online.

1321
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:02,000
Instagram is such a great tell for
people.

1322
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,910
I was going to work with this guy and I
was like,

1323
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:06,190
I asked my other friend,
they said,

1324
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:07,250
do you know him?
Like,

1325
01:00:07,251 --> 01:00:08,660
is he,
this is just a,

1326
01:00:08,661 --> 01:00:09,890
he's a director,
was like,

1327
01:00:09,891 --> 01:00:11,930
do you know this game?
And uh,

1328
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:13,550
he's like,
well,

1329
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:14,750
I don't want to say anything.
I'm like,

1330
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:15,340
what?
She,

1331
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:17,930
she's just look at his instagram.
I was like,

1332
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:18,793
oh,
what a,

1333
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,920
what an old man thing that I didn't
think to do that.

1334
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:23,480
So just go on the instagram.
You're like,

1335
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:26,460
oh,
there were train wreck,

1336
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:29,030
train wreck.
Just seeing them posting all their

1337
01:00:29,810 --> 01:00:33,980
insanity inspirational stuff.
Now this was just pure bad chick

1338
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:37,070
teaching you partying.
You know how to be the fully actualized

1339
01:00:37,071 --> 01:00:39,110
person.
I don't mean Shit.

1340
01:00:39,111 --> 01:00:40,010
I'm Kevin,
by the way.

1341
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:44,090
I mean Kevin is he,
he's one of those guys that get shit

1342
01:00:44,091 --> 01:00:44,450
done.

1343
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:47,540
Like he's Kevin,
Kevin Hart when I was saying like Kevin

1344
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:48,201
Hart's thing.
No,

1345
01:00:48,201 --> 01:00:51,350
he's,
he legitimately get things done and also

1346
01:00:51,351 --> 01:00:54,560
legitimately gets a thrill out of
helping people get motivated.

1347
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:57,230
Exactly.
He does runs where he brings hundreds of

1348
01:00:57,231 --> 01:01:00,800
people out running with them and say you
do like a five k and everybody yacht

1349
01:01:00,801 --> 01:01:03,030
show up.
I know.

1350
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:06,170
And everybody will run with Kevin Hart.
He's legit.

1351
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,120
Hey,
how far do you run when you run with

1352
01:01:08,121 --> 01:01:09,980
your dog?
No more than,

1353
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:13,040
well,
Marshall doesn't like to,

1354
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:15,650
he gets to the point of the end of the
run.

1355
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:20,000
He's only a year old,
like two miles is about.

1356
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:20,840
Yes,
we're,

1357
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:21,651
we're,
you know,

1358
01:01:21,651 --> 01:01:23,890
push a pretty good pace in the hill and
the hill.

1359
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:27,650
Very steep hills at two and I don't
bring any water for him.

1360
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:29,270
Oh No,
no.

1361
01:01:29,271 --> 01:01:31,760
So at two miles,
that's all I want to push them because

1362
01:01:31,761 --> 01:01:35,980
at the end his fucking tongue is bright
red and he's like two miles up hills is,

1363
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:36,860
that's a lot.

1364
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,510
It's great.
He's great for the rest of the day.

1365
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:40,190
Yeah.
The rest of the day he's like,

1366
01:01:40,191 --> 01:01:43,130
hey man,
chill best.

1367
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:45,110
He's such a good dog.
Bad.

1368
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:48,590
I love golden retrievers.
They're so good.

1369
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:50,030
Yeah,
they are great dogs.

1370
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:53,600
They're so food oriented though.
Sometimes to the point of being

1371
01:01:53,601 --> 01:01:55,610
annoying,
so it was my lab.

1372
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:57,110
Yeah.
Labs are two,

1373
01:01:57,111 --> 01:01:59,090
same thing.
Just a lot of dogs are like that.

1374
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:00,230
Yeah.
If they're active,

1375
01:02:00,231 --> 01:02:01,400
they're hungry.
Yeah.

1376
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:04,040
Metabolism is quick and they want to eat
to make just yet.

1377
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:09,080
The good news is they're really easy to
train with food because they love food

1378
01:02:09,081 --> 01:02:11,540
so much.
Just give them like little treats and

1379
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:14,930
he's this dog that I,
that I have Marshall,

1380
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:19,590
he's the best I've ever had as far as
like listening to sit and stay and lie

1381
01:02:19,591 --> 01:02:19,980
down

1382
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,840
and stuff like that.
And when I go running with him,

1383
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:25,200
I don't worry about him.
He stays close to me.

1384
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:27,630
That's cool.
He runs and then I'll like,

1385
01:02:27,631 --> 01:02:28,860
he'll,
he's ahead of me and I go,

1386
01:02:28,861 --> 01:02:30,240
hey man,
slow down.

1387
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:33,130
And they'll just stop and wait for me
and then I'll come up to them.

1388
01:02:33,131 --> 01:02:35,010
Then it'll start running again.
It's great.

1389
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,100
I've never,
I've never,

1390
01:02:36,101 --> 01:02:38,700
uh,
taken her off leash like that and I feel

1391
01:02:38,701 --> 01:02:41,190
like it'd be a blast.
The only thing I worry about is

1392
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:42,810
rattlesnakes.
Yeah.

1393
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,300
That's,
that's an issue because I don't think he

1394
01:02:45,301 --> 01:02:49,590
knows exactly what a rattlesnake is.
I bet the instinct would kick in if he

1395
01:02:49,591 --> 01:02:52,080
didn't get surprised by it.
There were the war instincts.

1396
01:02:52,081 --> 01:02:53,340
I'm worried about it.
The wrong ones,

1397
01:02:53,341 --> 01:02:54,540
which are to get clothes.
Oh,

1398
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:58,140
you think and get bit,
it's think they'd be like all in ancient

1399
01:02:58,141 --> 01:02:59,400
Dna of hearing that rattle.

1400
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,680
Like Ah,
three dogs that were bit by

1401
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:04,380
rattlesnakes.
Oh really?

1402
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:06,780
Yeah,
because they went after it.

1403
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:07,750
Yeah.
One,

1404
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,920
one of them got bit,
I brought him to the doctor and I'm

1405
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:12,630
like,
I think he got bit by a rattlesnake and

1406
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:14,440
the veterinarians like,
Oh,

1407
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:16,260
you gonna play me as I'm going to play
the sad song.

1408
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:18,030
And the veterinary,
they're fine.

1409
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:20,670
He lived the,
but the veterinarian was like,

1410
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:22,650
um,
everything seems okay.

1411
01:03:22,651 --> 01:03:23,820
Am I,
I don't know man.

1412
01:03:23,821 --> 01:03:26,790
I'm pretty sure the snake got him and he
goes,

1413
01:03:26,791 --> 01:03:27,780
well,
you know,

1414
01:03:27,781 --> 01:03:28,560
if,
uh,

1415
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,750
if he's acting funny later,
let me know.

1416
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:34,740
So I bring them home.
Our laters face swells up like a fucking

1417
01:03:34,741 --> 01:03:38,790
basketball.
It just took a while for it to kick in.

1418
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:42,180
I thought I was doing the right thing by
getting him to the vet in time.

1419
01:03:42,181 --> 01:03:43,590
I'm like,
I'm gonna just get them there right

1420
01:03:43,591 --> 01:03:44,100
away.

1421
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:45,950
I'm in the car,
you know,

1422
01:03:45,951 --> 01:03:47,340
I just beat the clock.
Yeah.

1423
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:51,250
Yeah.
And it took a while for the venom to

1424
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:55,300
like sink into his house.
It took over an hour because I was at

1425
01:03:55,301 --> 01:03:56,620
the mention hour.
Yeah.

1426
01:03:56,730 --> 01:03:58,110
Yeah.
Because I was at the veterinarian's

1427
01:03:58,111 --> 01:03:59,820
office,
um,

1428
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:01,800
within,
he got bit,

1429
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:04,530
I had them there within 35,
40 minutes.

1430
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,350
And then the vet,
the vet's looking at items like,

1431
01:04:07,351 --> 01:04:09,420
I don't see any marks.
I don't see any blood.

1432
01:04:09,421 --> 01:04:11,190
There's no like clear,
uh,

1433
01:04:11,191 --> 01:04:14,540
he might have gotten missed or the,
the thing might not have gotten even a

1434
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:16,110
minimum,
maybe got lucky.

1435
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,070
So I take him home,
his face just like boom,

1436
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:22,200
it happens.
Their face swells up.

1437
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:23,550
Oh,
it's brutal.

1438
01:04:23,590 --> 01:04:26,130
Yeah.
And then it costs thousands of dollars.

1439
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,260
It's very expensive.
The antivenom,

1440
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:32,160
they use the antivenom.
It's really expensive just to inject

1441
01:04:32,161 --> 01:04:33,540
that.
It's thousands of dollars.

1442
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:35,490
Yeah.
Which is really bad for people that are

1443
01:04:35,491 --> 01:04:36,121
poor,
you know,

1444
01:04:36,121 --> 01:04:38,910
if you don't have any money to pay for
that and your dog,

1445
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:42,030
it's bit,
it's a fucking tremendous stress.

1446
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:43,160
Oh Man.
Yeah.

1447
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,150
Would they survive?
I mean,

1448
01:04:45,151 --> 01:04:47,710
if it's,
that dose was five.

1449
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:49,160
Yeah.
If some dogs,

1450
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:51,010
dogs don't.
Yeah.

1451
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:53,180
But some dogs die from it for sure.
Uh,

1452
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:54,630
it's,
it's really bad for them.

1453
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:58,170
I don't have a place to run my dog like
that.

1454
01:04:58,171 --> 01:05:00,380
We've got like all streets around this,
so it's like,

1455
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:01,500
hey,
you got to drive them somewhere,

1456
01:05:01,501 --> 01:05:04,080
man.
Take him to a Runyon Canyon or

1457
01:05:04,081 --> 01:05:05,910
something.
Can you take him off leash in those

1458
01:05:05,911 --> 01:05:07,620
places?
It's not.

1459
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,770
The problem is you never know what kind
of dogs are going to run into,

1460
01:05:10,771 --> 01:05:14,190
or coyotes or angry moms.
Yeah,

1461
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,780
that's true too.
Yeah.

1462
01:05:15,781 --> 01:05:17,480
It was a lot of people like that.
Yeah.

1463
01:05:17,670 --> 01:05:17,980
Yeah.
If you

1464
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,330
can go places that are less populated,
those are the best for off-leash type

1465
01:05:22,331 --> 01:05:24,340
activities.
She would be so happy,

1466
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:27,820
but she's a lab too sweet dogs and wants
to run and they're not,

1467
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:30,280
they're not like the kind of dogs.
It's not like you're taking a press

1468
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:32,850
Kenario hundred and 20 pounds.
Yeah.

1469
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,590
Demon dog.
No,

1470
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:37,160
but nothing loose because she's sweet.
Yeah.

1471
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:39,580
Demon dog.
What was the name of that dog?

1472
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:42,970
Presta Kenario.
He never seen my mouse there tanks.

1473
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:47,060
They're these huge fucking muscular
canary.

1474
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:48,890
I'm looking,
there's a,

1475
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:52,720
a guy who was breeding some that I know
is making these Brenda ones.

1476
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:56,890
They look so crazy.
They're like the ultimate guard dog.

1477
01:05:57,570 --> 01:05:59,980
Little dinosaur being the size of the
thing.

1478
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:01,030
Oh,
it's like a mastiff.

1479
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,130
Yeah.
Super aggressive.

1480
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,270
Oh really?
Yeah.

1481
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,190
Oh,
quick on that black one above it.

1482
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:09,770
That will be that gray top [inaudible]
shoulders.

1483
01:06:11,590 --> 01:06:13,180
He's going to fuck you with that big
Dick.

1484
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:16,150
God,
giant Horse Dickies.

1485
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:21,160
Got His doggy legs.
Oh my God.

1486
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,630
Are these are,
these are round.

1487
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:23,320
Yeah,
man.

1488
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:24,250
They're,
they're real.

1489
01:06:24,251 --> 01:06:27,550
They're not dinosaurs.
They have these like people have these.

1490
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:28,960
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1491
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:30,010
I know.
Some people have.

1492
01:06:30,011 --> 01:06:31,900
Um,
my friend mark has two of them.

1493
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:34,390
Yeah,
that is scary.

1494
01:06:34,430 --> 01:06:38,380
So enormous dark there.
Apparently very good loyal watchdog.

1495
01:06:38,381 --> 01:06:39,970
So they are,
they're nice to have a family.

1496
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:41,080
Well,
it's all in.

1497
01:06:41,081 --> 01:06:43,060
Who breeds them?
Look at the one where the dogs on a

1498
01:06:43,061 --> 01:06:46,270
leash.
Polen are there like a fucking,

1499
01:06:46,271 --> 01:06:49,670
she's filled on that thing.
Blow.

1500
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:52,300
What a nightmare.
If that was chasing after you,

1501
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:53,380
fuck,
fuck,

1502
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:54,640
fuck,
fuck.

1503
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:58,200
What are you doing?
A dog comes at you and it's going to

1504
01:06:58,210 --> 01:07:00,550
wants to bite you.
Just punch it and give him your arm.

1505
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:02,170
Just giving me your arm.
No.

1506
01:07:02,171 --> 01:07:04,270
A dog's going to attack you if you know
for sure.

1507
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:08,140
If you have the time you feed him,
your arm stabbed the shit out of him

1508
01:07:08,141 --> 01:07:11,170
while he's grabbing your arm.
You then nick.

1509
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:12,230
Oh yeah.
Well,

1510
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:14,650
if you don't have a weapon,
you're fucked.

1511
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:17,080
So why don't you carry a weapon?
Should have a weapon.

1512
01:07:17,081 --> 01:07:18,610
Always.
I should always have a weapon.

1513
01:07:18,611 --> 01:07:20,020
Yes.
You never know when you get to attack.

1514
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,033
No weapon.

1515
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:24,670
Oh really?

1516
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:27,780
Hi.
Hey.

1517
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:29,040
I see.
I told you,

1518
01:07:29,041 --> 01:07:32,370
you carry out a show tack by a Goddamn
Dog.

1519
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,460
It's a dog knife.
Never know.

1520
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,760
Nice coyotes.
Mountain lions.

1521
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,170
I was,
what do you do when you,

1522
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:42,540
when you,
why he got put it in your bag,

1523
01:07:43,110 --> 01:07:45,180
your teeth like a pirate.
Damn.

1524
01:07:45,181 --> 01:07:47,730
Check.
Tsa Pre.

1525
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:50,730
No,
I don't bring it with me when I travel.

1526
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:53,070
I just opening boxes today.
I'm only kidding.

1527
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:54,550
Oh,
you don't carry that all the time,

1528
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:58,760
asshole.
I had open boxes.

1529
01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:00,930
A lot of people do.
Don't you think there's a lot of people

1530
01:08:00,931 --> 01:08:02,970
out there and next to you at the seven
11 that have,

1531
01:08:02,971 --> 01:08:03,910
uh,
and yeah,

1532
01:08:03,930 --> 01:08:05,700
they're carrying shit.
Oh yeah.

1533
01:08:05,701 --> 01:08:09,990
I know a guy who used to carry a gun on
his ankle.

1534
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:12,330
He might still do it,
I don't want to say his name,

1535
01:08:12,331 --> 01:08:14,400
but he was the guy he used to fight for
the UFC.

1536
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:18,290
He a gun on him and he's huge.
He's a giant man.

1537
01:08:18,450 --> 01:08:20,240
Right?
He carried a gun on his ankle.

1538
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:25,100
He carried one in the small of his back.
He carried a knife in his front pocket

1539
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:28,670
on both sides.
He had two knives that he carried all

1540
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:32,360
the time and he carried his shoulder
holster just to go to the store.

1541
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:34,910
Everywhere he went.
Everywhere he went,

1542
01:08:34,911 --> 01:08:39,680
he was a locked and loaded like he was
the wrong guy to fuck with in every

1543
01:08:39,681 --> 01:08:44,681
single possible way.
260 pounds and enormous trained black

1544
01:08:45,571 --> 01:08:50,510
belt.
She FC champion loaded to the hilt

1545
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:53,450
carrying knives and guns all over his
persona.

1546
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:57,140
Like the cool part about that,
which I always like in the movies is

1547
01:08:57,141 --> 01:09:00,710
when you're done with your day and
you're just unloading all that stuff on

1548
01:09:00,711 --> 01:09:04,870
your dresser,
you know when your client take,

1549
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,650
have a strap on thing or that thing.

1550
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:09,680
That always seems,
I love that part of being a man of just

1551
01:09:09,681 --> 01:09:12,920
having all the stuff you got to unload
to them.

1552
01:09:12,921 --> 01:09:17,921
Go to like beyond keys and y hippie like
gun machete,

1553
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:20,300
others guns.
Right.

1554
01:09:20,301 --> 01:09:22,070
Exactly.
Cause anybody to carry brass knuckles

1555
01:09:22,071 --> 01:09:23,060
anymore.
Those out.

1556
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,250
They must've made me.
Yeah,

1557
01:09:25,251 --> 01:09:26,170
why not?
Yeah.

1558
01:09:26,171 --> 01:09:28,160
It's not a thing anymore.
Not like,

1559
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:31,250
I wonder if those are legal.
That was something you'd hear about when

1560
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:32,200
we were kids.
Oh,

1561
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:35,240
they got brass knuckles cause bugs bunny
had him.

1562
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:39,770
That's the only place we were hearing
stuff with children.

1563
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:42,250
You don't hear about brass knuckles at
all and the yeah.

1564
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:43,760
Now words are what?
Hurt.

1565
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:48,110
Get Your Aa,
get you some brass knuckles shape or her

1566
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:52,580
with words.
Words are violence.

1567
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,220
Give me some brass knuckles machine.
Yeah,

1568
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,600
the old day Shane.
Yeah,

1569
01:09:56,601 --> 01:09:57,790
the old day.
Shane.

1570
01:09:57,810 --> 01:09:59,230
Why did they talk like that back then?

1571
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:01,460
Train.
Cause that's the way he spoke back then.

1572
01:10:01,461 --> 01:10:03,530
Shea,
you had that coffee just sitting there

1573
01:10:03,531 --> 01:10:05,540
for longest time.
It's still hot in port.

1574
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:06,711
No,
I had a bunch.

1575
01:10:06,711 --> 01:10:08,030
You had a little bit of it.
Yeah.

1576
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:13,250
I love coffee.
You do addicted Brennan Shab told me

1577
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:16,700
that he drinks 12 cups of coffee a day
and that he's been throwing up a lot

1578
01:10:16,701 --> 01:10:19,940
lately.
And it's because of the coffee because

1579
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,550
all the acid in the stomach.
Yeah.

1580
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,150
Just coffee.
Give you acid.

1581
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:24,230
Is that what it does?
Yeah,

1582
01:10:24,231 --> 01:10:26,450
it's acidic.
Yeah,

1583
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:28,450
putting the beans,
all that jazz.

1584
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,980
And that fucks with your stomach.
Yeah.

1585
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:32,210
If you're drinking,
how many?

1586
01:10:32,211 --> 01:10:36,860
1212 yeah.
It was drinking 12 cups of coffee a day.

1587
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,860
Yeah,
that's an addiction.

1588
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:41,060
Music for him,
for his stomach.

1589
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:43,460
I said that's a big time.
Addiction.

1590
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,320
Cops

1591
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:52,550
can make
coffee is highly acidic and it can

1592
01:10:53,841 --> 01:10:58,841
stimulate the hyper section.
Secretion of gastric acid.

1593
01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:04,000
Caffeinated coffee has been shown to
increase the city acidity to a greater

1594
01:11:04,001 --> 01:11:07,600
degree than either regular coffee or
caffeine alone.

1595
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:11,320
So decaffeinated coffee is more acidic
than anything,

1596
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:14,640
which is caffeine and coffee.
Stimulate

1597
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:19,670
gastric acid secretion and decaffeinated
coffee raises serum gastrin levels.

1598
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:24,660
That's disgusting.
That back to your wine guy.

1599
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:27,510
Um,
let's see.

1600
01:11:27,511 --> 01:11:27,991
Oh,
it's fine.

1601
01:11:27,991 --> 01:11:31,080
The guy that's hook up with a guy,
I do know one guy,

1602
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:33,930
maynard Maynard,
maynard Keenan from tool.

1603
01:11:33,970 --> 01:11:35,080
He's a friend of mine.
He's actually,

1604
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:38,670
he has a vineyard,
like a real vineyard in Arizona.

1605
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:40,170
That's right.
It's not in calc.

1606
01:11:40,190 --> 01:11:41,880
He makes great one.
Oh yeah.

1607
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:42,930
Oh my God.
Yeah.

1608
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:45,060
Well he's an artist.
He's a weird motherfucker.

1609
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:50,130
Super,
super smart guy and makes wine the same

1610
01:11:50,131 --> 01:11:51,090
way.
He makes music.

1611
01:11:51,091 --> 01:11:54,480
Like he,
they made it tool album and one of the

1612
01:11:54,481 --> 01:11:57,360
songs was,
was they,

1613
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:00,870
they wrote a song to the FIBONACCI
sequence.

1614
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:04,290
What did,
what did you just pull up the vineyard?

1615
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:05,460
I do see us.
Dot.

1616
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:06,730
Yeah.
Um,

1617
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:11,380
he wrote a song to the FIBONACCI
sequence had been not cheesy.

1618
01:12:11,390 --> 01:12:15,270
A fibonacci sequence is a mathematical
sequence.

1619
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:20,760
The way it works is like it goes like
zero and the next number is one.

1620
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,580
Um,
and the next time was two and then two

1621
01:12:23,581 --> 01:12:27,350
plus one which is three.
And then uh,

1622
01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:31,680
then it keeps going like in this,
in this mathematical progression.

1623
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:33,480
And that's how they had the chord
progression.

1624
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:36,780
Had the chord progression link up to the
FIBONACCI sequence.

1625
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:39,240
Just for fun.
It's just a fucking maniac.

1626
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:44,810
But that same sort of attention to
detail and obsessing the,

1627
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:49,040
you know the intricacies of things.
He's an applied that to his wine.

1628
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:51,180
Amazing.
It's really good.

1629
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:54,570
What's the label?
A do ceus vineyards could do see us.

1630
01:12:54,571 --> 01:12:55,740
Yeah.
Yeah.

1631
01:12:55,741 --> 01:12:58,440
He has an Austin Maria too.
He has a small restaurant.

1632
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:00,660
Yeah.
Jeez that's crazy.

1633
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:03,090
That sounds good.
Yeah I think it gave me the food that

1634
01:13:03,091 --> 01:13:06,960
fuck oh really guy.
Oh that's where the flu k till he told

1635
01:13:06,961 --> 01:13:07,800
me just got over the flu.

1636
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:11,010
I'm like Oh shit head.
Cause I was hanging out with him in

1637
01:13:11,011 --> 01:13:15,900
Vegas and I think that's right when I
started to catch it and then I had like

1638
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,930
a little bit of a cough and then it got
a little worse and then I really did

1639
01:13:18,931 --> 01:13:20,070
myself in,
in the sauna.

1640
01:13:20,370 --> 01:13:23,440
I crank the sauna up the 210 degrees.
Oh relations.

1641
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:25,470
Uh,
apparently too high for people.

1642
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:29,370
How,
how high you supposed to go?

1643
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:34,950
One 76 to one nineties apparently people
like anyway to 20,

1644
01:13:35,030 --> 01:13:37,740
I went to,
I was at two 10 for about an hour.

1645
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:42,240
Not an hour.
But how long do you stay in there to 10

1646
01:13:42,241 --> 01:13:45,210
for?
I was in to 10 for at least 20 minutes.

1647
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:47,910
1515 minutes.
You know what?

1648
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,070
I don't know how long I did it at two
10.

1649
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:51,840
How long has that most of the day?
A bunch of times.

1650
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:54,750
Um,
to get the right benefits,

1651
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:59,780
you're supposed to 20 minutes at 176
degrees.

1652
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,640
It at least twice a week is like what
they recommend.

1653
01:14:02,641 --> 01:14:05,280
But sometimes you can get to four times
a week.

1654
01:14:05,790 --> 01:14:07,200
You're a lot better.
Off,

1655
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:11,620
what's the main thing it does for you?
It increases a bunch of things.

1656
01:14:11,621 --> 01:14:13,000
First of all,
does something called,

1657
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:16,510
it makes your body produce something
called heat shock proteins,

1658
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:20,620
which are the,
which radically reduce inflammation.

1659
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:25,770
It's similar in a lot of ways to cold
shock proteins that you would get from a

1660
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:28,550
cryogenic chamber treatments.
Uh,

1661
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:31,210
but can I ask a question,
which we showed them question,

1662
01:14:31,211 --> 01:14:34,000
but uh,
why is inflammation,

1663
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:36,170
why is anti-inflammatory?
Why,

1664
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:39,620
why is it bad to be inflamed?
Well,

1665
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:42,670
I mean,
I know it sounds kind of that's the root

1666
01:14:42,671 --> 01:14:45,010
of almost all diseases.
It is big,

1667
01:14:45,011 --> 01:14:46,900
big,
big cause of a lot.

1668
01:14:46,901 --> 01:14:48,550
Well that was one of the things about
this study.

1669
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:52,870
I think it was a Norwegian study on the
song and they showed a decrease in

1670
01:14:52,871 --> 01:14:56,290
mortality,
a 40% decrease in mortality,

1671
01:14:56,460 --> 01:15:00,250
uh,
amongst all causes from people that use

1672
01:15:00,251 --> 01:15:03,310
the sauna,
I think three times or four times a

1673
01:15:03,311 --> 01:15:03,790
week.

1674
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:04,900
What?
Yeah.

1675
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:08,530
Meaning 40% decrease in stroke,
heart attack,

1676
01:15:08,531 --> 01:15:12,340
all these different various factors.
And they think that that's attributed to

1677
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:14,590
the heat shock proteins.
Doctor Rhonda,

1678
01:15:14,591 --> 01:15:15,910
Patrick Healy.
Yeah.

1679
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:19,490
She's the one who got me into it.
She's a frequent guest and the podcasts

1680
01:15:19,491 --> 01:15:24,491
and super genius and a San Francisco.
Yeah.

1681
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:25,770
Oh,
that's cool.

1682
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:26,950
Yeah.
That's nice.

1683
01:15:26,951 --> 01:15:28,330
The coolest.
She's very cool.

1684
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:29,470
She,
we were just talking about,

1685
01:15:29,471 --> 01:15:31,480
she was on the Kardashians.
Oh really?

1686
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:32,740
Yeah.
Jamie was telling me,

1687
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:34,250
which you're talking about the
Kardashians.

1688
01:15:34,350 --> 01:15:36,340
That doesn't make sense to them.
How not to be inflamed.

1689
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:39,070
That's great.
Your lips are inflamed.

1690
01:15:39,071 --> 01:15:40,960
Are you sure you're not eating anything
weird?

1691
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:43,750
No aggressor and what's going on with
your butt?

1692
01:15:44,350 --> 01:15:46,980
Your Butt is inflamed.
It are you.

1693
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:51,490
Are you guys not getting in the Sauna?
If Kim Carney ash and gotten the sauna,

1694
01:15:51,491 --> 01:15:54,430
she probably starts sweating like,
you know,

1695
01:15:54,431 --> 01:15:59,431
like when you bake something,
like if you have like a slow cook pork

1696
01:15:59,471 --> 01:16:04,471
roast or something like that and you see
all juicy of juice come pop in,

1697
01:16:04,481 --> 01:16:06,850
all the top of it,
it's putting a tray under to catch the

1698
01:16:06,851 --> 01:16:07,420
drippings.

1699
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:09,300
Yeah.
Because you think about all squeezing

1700
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:15,300
all that fat that they pull out of the
sides and then suck in and they pumped

1701
01:16:15,961 --> 01:16:18,310
that stuff in the butt to make the but
extra big.

1702
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:21,640
And then you put that button,
the oven and that'll just get juicy.

1703
01:16:23,310 --> 01:16:25,390
Goody,
goody and Z.

1704
01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:28,000
I'll tell you what that is some good
eating is right.

1705
01:16:28,070 --> 01:16:29,290
Yeah.
Boil it down.

1706
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:32,470
So the heat,
the heat proteins,

1707
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,000
heat shock proteins.
Yeah.

1708
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:37,120
A cyto keens help you with inflammation.
Yes.

1709
01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:38,740
Yes.
It helps your body fight off

1710
01:16:38,741 --> 01:16:41,590
inflammation and so it doesn't in a
natural way,

1711
01:16:41,591 --> 01:16:45,820
instead of like nonsteroidal anti
inflammatories like Ibuprofen,

1712
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:47,890
things along those lines,
which are really bad for your gut

1713
01:16:47,891 --> 01:16:49,910
health.
Really bad for you.

1714
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:54,010
Like they say that Ibuprofen should be
taken rare.

1715
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:56,110
Rarely if ever.
Really.

1716
01:16:56,590 --> 01:16:59,230
Yeah.
It's apparently terrible for your body.

1717
01:16:59,231 --> 01:17:02,620
Can cause strokes and it also is really
bad for your,

1718
01:17:02,621 --> 01:17:03,790
your gut flora.

1719
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:07,270
I had a buddy,
my friend Cameron Hanes is a ultra

1720
01:17:07,271 --> 01:17:08,460
marathon runner.
He runs,

1721
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:12,590
he's crazy.
200 plus miles and he's nutty fucking

1722
01:17:12,591 --> 01:17:16,250
things taking Ibuprofen on a daily
basis.

1723
01:17:17,210 --> 01:17:21,380
And um,
got off of it after he listened to the

1724
01:17:21,381 --> 01:17:25,910
Rhonda Patrick podcasts and all of his
joint pain went away and his joint pain

1725
01:17:25,911 --> 01:17:28,760
was literally being caused.
He thought it was being caused by all is

1726
01:17:28,761 --> 01:17:32,450
running.
It was being caused by his taking of the

1727
01:17:32,451 --> 01:17:37,370
nonsteroidal antiinflammatories which
increased his body's inflammation

1728
01:17:37,371 --> 01:17:38,810
levels.
Yes.

1729
01:17:38,811 --> 01:17:42,980
Which is crazy because it damages your
gut bacteria because it's fucking

1730
01:17:42,981 --> 01:17:45,050
poison.
He's taking 800 milligrams this shit

1731
01:17:45,051 --> 01:17:46,940
every day.
She body freaks out.

1732
01:17:46,941 --> 01:17:47,840
I was telling him like,
dude,

1733
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:51,800
you're significantly increasing your
risk for stroke.

1734
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:55,850
And I sent him all these studies and
findings on Ibuprofen.

1735
01:17:56,050 --> 01:17:58,010
So he stops,
he gets off of it.

1736
01:17:58,310 --> 01:17:59,960
All of his joint pain goes away.

1737
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:03,290
No,
literally causing joint pain.

1738
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:06,710
So how has your gut connected to
inflammation?

1739
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:09,050
Inflammation,
which is one of the reasons why people

1740
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:11,900
tell you not to eat bread.
It's why people tell you not to eat

1741
01:18:11,901 --> 01:18:14,420
sugar.
Refined carbohydrates cause

1742
01:18:14,421 --> 01:18:16,250
inflammation.
And one of the ways that cause it

1743
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:21,440
through the gut leakage and what we say
inflamed.

1744
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:24,620
What is inflamed?
That's a good point.

1745
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:28,330
Let's
pull that up in a way that a car

1746
01:18:28,430 --> 01:18:30,460
describe it.
What is that?

1747
01:18:30,461 --> 01:18:32,480
Inflammation.
What is inflammation?

1748
01:18:32,481 --> 01:18:34,700
Sorry.
If you're going over style from the need

1749
01:18:34,701 --> 01:18:37,760
to know about inflammation,
inflammation is a defense mechanism in

1750
01:18:37,761 --> 01:18:40,050
the body.
The immune system recognizes damage

1751
01:18:40,051 --> 01:18:40,731
cells.
Oh,

1752
01:18:40,731 --> 01:18:45,731
these fucking cops with the pop up on
the immune system recognizes damage

1753
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:49,850
cells,
irritants and pathogens.

1754
01:18:49,851 --> 01:18:53,090
And it begins the healing process.
When something harmful or irritating

1755
01:18:53,091 --> 01:18:54,890
effects,
part of your body is a biological

1756
01:18:54,891 --> 01:18:56,150
response to try to remove it.

1757
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:59,060
The signs and symptoms of inflammation
can be uncomfortable,

1758
01:18:59,061 --> 01:19:01,310
but or to show that the body is trying
to heal itself.

1759
01:19:01,311 --> 01:19:05,420
So if you're in a constant state of
inflammation because you're constantly

1760
01:19:05,421 --> 01:19:09,380
taking in foods that your body is
reacting to in a very adverse way,

1761
01:19:10,130 --> 01:19:13,220
that is what causes a lot of diseases on
peep in people.

1762
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:18,910
And it also causes your body to your
feeding certain aspects of gut bacteria,

1763
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:23,570
you know,
that are just,

1764
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:26,330
it's you're just not healthy.
And so you're putting,

1765
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:29,840
so the body is actually the same way
they would fight a disease,

1766
01:19:29,841 --> 01:19:33,290
is fighting these foods that come in
exactly these medicines or whatever.

1767
01:19:33,330 --> 01:19:34,620
Yes.
Foreign things.

1768
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:38,480
Exactly.
A big thing with food's a big thing with

1769
01:19:38,481 --> 01:19:40,640
alcohol.
You see people with puffy faces,

1770
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,900
they get it like permanently pumped up
and they're all soft,

1771
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:45,920
fucking inflamed,
everything's inflamed.

1772
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:48,740
Gut sticks out,
their guts inflamed.

1773
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:51,600
And is it yourselves?
Is it your arteries and everything?

1774
01:19:51,650 --> 01:19:53,480
Everything is just pull up the rest of
the things.

1775
01:19:53,481 --> 01:19:56,300
Just kind of go back to that often the
fluid.

1776
01:20:00,260 --> 01:20:01,640
Um,
yeah.

1777
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:05,240
Okay.
Chronic inflammation can eventually

1778
01:20:05,241 --> 01:20:07,800
cause severe t several diseases and
conditions,

1779
01:20:07,801 --> 01:20:10,110
including some cancers and rheumatoid
arthritis,

1780
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:13,080
infections,
wounds in any kind of tissue,

1781
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:14,790
uh,
would not be able to heal itself without

1782
01:20:14,791 --> 01:20:18,030
an inflammatory response.
So inflammation is a part of the body's

1783
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:20,700
immune system.
So what you're doing is you're,

1784
01:20:20,701 --> 01:20:24,090
you're in a constant state of damage
when you're eating shitty food.

1785
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:29,810
So if you're constantly eating sugar and
drinking sodas and fucking corn syrup,

1786
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:31,680
all that bullshit.
Yeah.

1787
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:35,210
You're putting these weird chemicals in
your body and your body's freaking out.

1788
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:36,330
So,

1789
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:37,290
yeah,
this is,

1790
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:40,080
they're not just making a distinction
between,

1791
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:42,660
um,
inflammation that comes from like a

1792
01:20:42,661 --> 01:20:47,250
bruising or injury where your body's
trying to heal itself versus something

1793
01:20:47,251 --> 01:20:49,900
that's happening internally,
right from,

1794
01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:54,360
from your consumption of shitty foods.
But there's this whole crazy many

1795
01:20:54,361 --> 01:20:57,390
inflammatory causing foods that people
eat on a daily basis.

1796
01:20:57,391 --> 01:21:00,110
And we just think of it as food,
Pizza,

1797
01:21:00,530 --> 01:21:01,620
pizza's delicious,
right.

1798
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:04,200
Fucking full of inflammation causing
bullshit.

1799
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:05,860
Why?
It's uh,

1800
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:07,890
well,
um,

1801
01:21:07,990 --> 01:21:10,150
first of cheeses,
the bread,

1802
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:10,980
the bread's,

1803
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:15,110
which is unfortunately what you make,
but I think that your bread is sour

1804
01:21:15,111 --> 01:21:17,490
dough bread,
which is different because sour dough

1805
01:21:17,491 --> 01:21:21,000
bread apparently has less complex
gluten's in it because,

1806
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:21,983
right,
right.

1807
01:21:22,050 --> 01:21:22,890
Yeah.
I have friends,

1808
01:21:22,891 --> 01:21:23,940
I have friends that,
uh,

1809
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,313
that,
uh,

1810
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:28,020
have gluten issues that can eat my
bread,

1811
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:31,980
not a to access,
but it doesn't bother them the way they

1812
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:35,940
were processed bread about Islam.
There's something about sour dough bread

1813
01:21:36,150 --> 01:21:37,500
that ha,
it's different.

1814
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:38,820
No.
Commercial Yeast,

1815
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,850
the gluten structure is a little,
a little,

1816
01:21:41,851 --> 01:21:43,530
a weaker.
Yeah.

1817
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:44,960
Well,

1818
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:47,660
there's a great documentary that I
watched recently called what's with

1819
01:21:47,661 --> 01:21:51,380
wheat and it was all about how they
changed wheat,

1820
01:21:51,650 --> 01:21:54,260
um,
to make higher yield,

1821
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:58,070
uh,
wi which w you could grow more wheat and

1822
01:21:58,071 --> 01:22:01,280
a shorter area and have a higher yield
and that the,

1823
01:22:01,281 --> 01:22:03,830
the gluten's in that wheat are much
more,

1824
01:22:03,831 --> 01:22:08,060
they're much more dense and complex then
the natural wheat that we used to eat

1825
01:22:08,061 --> 01:22:09,910
and 150 plus years ago.
Right.

1826
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:13,720
This bread that you're going to eat,
it comes from this great,

1827
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:18,780
um,
mill in a Utah that is pure organic

1828
01:22:21,130 --> 01:22:24,130
small crops.
So you won't have a problem with this.

1829
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:26,020
So it's like heirloom wheat,
is that what they call it?

1830
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,480
I don't even know.
That was a thing until maynard.

1831
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:31,330
Yes.
Who told me about that is they use

1832
01:22:31,331 --> 01:22:34,990
heirloom wheat in his pasta and he makes
it as lost around.

1833
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:37,090
Interesting.
It's easier for people to Digest.

1834
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,100
Yeah.
It's,

1835
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,360
you know,
it's a little more expensive and a

1836
01:22:39,370 --> 01:22:41,200
little harder to get,
but it's a,

1837
01:22:41,210 --> 01:22:43,600
it makes a difference in the flavor is
so much better.

1838
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:44,230
Yeah.

1839
01:22:44,230 --> 01:22:46,670
Bye.
And Pasta when I rarely eat pasta,

1840
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:50,150
but I do eat it.
I buy it from Italy and they have

1841
01:22:50,210 --> 01:22:54,920
heirloom pasta in Italy and just you
don't feel as fucking gross after you

1842
01:22:54,921 --> 01:22:55,340
eat it.

1843
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:57,920
Yeah.
It's not like that brick that,

1844
01:22:57,921 --> 01:23:00,230
yeah,
that punch in the gut that just fucking

1845
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:02,420
like you ate a bag of rocks.
So what is the,

1846
01:23:02,421 --> 01:23:05,470
so the sauna,
if you're eating all this stuff probably

1847
01:23:05,471 --> 01:23:06,100
help and

1848
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:08,170
you're putting in there and you're the,
it would help,

1849
01:23:08,171 --> 01:23:10,750
but you're also dealing with your gut
biome,

1850
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:11,850
right?
You're,

1851
01:23:11,850 --> 01:23:15,340
you're,
you're forcing your body to your eating

1852
01:23:15,341 --> 01:23:20,341
foods that are going to encourage the
growth of certain types of gut bacteria.

1853
01:23:21,410 --> 01:23:25,270
Right.
That live off of sugars and live off of,

1854
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:31,410
a friend of mine got the gastro surgery,
Yo and uh,

1855
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:37,050
she was diabetic and she had the gastro
thing done and her diabetes leveled out

1856
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:43,540
and she said it was,
the doctor says because of the bacteria,

1857
01:23:43,541 --> 01:23:46,750
because the something that they did and
taking something out.

1858
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:48,160
Does this make sense at all?

1859
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:49,111
Yeah.
Well,

1860
01:23:49,111 --> 01:23:50,930
she probably had a terrible diet.
Yeah,

1861
01:23:51,270 --> 01:23:53,340
probably.
Which is also probably one of the

1862
01:23:53,341 --> 01:23:55,260
reasons why she was so big.
Right.

1863
01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:58,710
And you know that there's different
kinds of bacteria.

1864
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:00,340
There's different types of diabetes,
right?

1865
01:24:00,390 --> 01:24:04,590
There's diabetes that has caused
entirely by diet and this diabetes that

1866
01:24:04,591 --> 01:24:09,591
is genetic and the type of diabetes that
is caused by diet is reversible.

1867
01:24:09,990 --> 01:24:12,840
It happens with a lot of people that
wind up going on,

1868
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:15,030
you know,
calorie restricted diets.

1869
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:18,150
Right.
Reduce the amount of sugar they take in.

1870
01:24:18,151 --> 01:24:21,960
And a Dean del Rey,
Dean del Ray was a diabetic.

1871
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,790
Yeah,
he went to a doctor and the doctor he

1872
01:24:24,791 --> 01:24:26,650
was,
he had a real candy problem.

1873
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,660
He's eating candy constantly.
Oh really?

1874
01:24:28,690 --> 01:24:29,980
Yeah.
It was hooked on sugar.

1875
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:32,020
Yeah.
He talked to him now he's like sure is

1876
01:24:32,021 --> 01:24:33,220
the fucking devil,
man.

1877
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:34,220
Yeah,
he dropped,

1878
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:38,050
he dropped a lot of weight.
He dropped a lot of weight and got

1879
01:24:38,051 --> 01:24:39,080
really fit.
Yeah.

1880
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:41,880
He looks great.
The Gym all the time now really high.

1881
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:45,490
It looks very healthy.
Like Dean's never looked better now man,

1882
01:24:45,491 --> 01:24:46,990
I don't eat that.
Yeah,

1883
01:24:46,991 --> 01:24:48,550
he's like sugars,
the fucking devil,

1884
01:24:48,551 --> 01:24:51,490
man.
He's not wrong.

1885
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:52,720
No,
he's not wrong at all.

1886
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:57,310
I mean is great.
Every now and then it's like a lot of

1887
01:24:57,311 --> 01:24:58,600
things,
a little treat,

1888
01:24:58,630 --> 01:25:00,940
you know,
Tiramisu after a nice meal.

1889
01:25:01,530 --> 01:25:04,000
That's what it used to look like.
Wow.

1890
01:25:04,001 --> 01:25:04,391
Yeah.
Look,

1891
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:07,890
he looks inflamed.
That face looks inflamed.

1892
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:09,460
That thing right there,
it says,

1893
01:25:09,970 --> 01:25:11,380
people ask me,
how do I do it?

1894
01:25:11,470 --> 01:25:14,560
How do you not get tempted to eat sugar?
I keep photos like this around the house

1895
01:25:14,561 --> 01:25:16,330
to constantly remind me,
never again.

1896
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:17,620
Fat Dean.
Fuck.

1897
01:25:17,621 --> 01:25:22,570
Sugar healthy.
See that's inspiration right there.

1898
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:23,710
Yeah,
yeah.

1899
01:25:23,711 --> 01:25:24,491
Well,
yeah,

1900
01:25:24,491 --> 01:25:27,520
you've got a picture of yourself when
you're almost dying of a disease.

1901
01:25:28,150 --> 01:25:31,570
It's very,
very common for people to eat too much

1902
01:25:31,571 --> 01:25:35,470
sugar for long periods of time and then
go to a doctor and the doctor tells me,

1903
01:25:35,471 --> 01:25:37,060
you have diabetes.
Right?

1904
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:39,580
It's very common and especially in
America.

1905
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:42,130
Totally brought on just by your diet.
Yeah.

1906
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:43,930
Yeah.
Your body's just freaking out.

1907
01:25:43,931 --> 01:25:48,250
You're constantly making it processed.
Sugar insulins jacked up,

1908
01:25:48,290 --> 01:25:51,580
spiked all the time,
and everything's fucking haywire in your

1909
01:25:51,581 --> 01:25:53,620
system and your body's like,
hey,

1910
01:25:53,621 --> 01:25:55,740
shithead.
Stopped with the skittles that's

1911
01:25:55,741 --> 01:25:58,840
supposed to eat like this.
You dumb fuck you lard ass.

1912
01:25:59,410 --> 01:26:02,110
What about intermittent fasting?
I do that.

1913
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:02,973
You do?
Yeah.

1914
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:04,160
I kind

1915
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,540
of liked this idea.
I love it.

1916
01:26:05,810 --> 01:26:08,750
Yeah.
I eat a for 10 hours a day and some

1917
01:26:08,751 --> 01:26:11,230
people say you should do eight hours
every day.

1918
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:12,080
16.
Yeah,

1919
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:14,750
every day.
Well I take a couple of days off a week.

1920
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:17,980
Jimmy Kimmel or Jimmy Kimmel did you
read?

1921
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:19,560
Uh,
wouldn't eat on.

1922
01:26:19,610 --> 01:26:24,610
He would eat like 500 calories on Monday
and Thursday and just like real cat with

1923
01:26:25,731 --> 01:26:30,520
fasting basically on those days and then
eat whatever he wanted on the other

1924
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:31,353
days.
And that's how,

1925
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:35,560
that's how we lost all of his weight.
So for two days a week eats like have

1926
01:26:35,561 --> 01:26:39,620
severely restricted amount of calories
and the rest of the week you can eat

1927
01:26:39,621 --> 01:26:40,760
whatever he wants.
Yeah,

1928
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,950
that seems crazy.
Doesn't it seem crazy?

1929
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:47,120
He said it was,
it's a tricking your body into a

1930
01:26:47,210 --> 01:26:50,330
tricking your body.
And it was so the metabolism was like

1931
01:26:50,331 --> 01:26:52,730
kicking in and I don't know what the
specifics were,

1932
01:26:52,731 --> 01:26:55,070
but that's what he did when he dropped
all that weight.

1933
01:26:55,071 --> 01:26:57,230
He wasn't exercising and that's what he
did.

1934
01:26:57,231 --> 01:26:59,360
He Monday,
Mondays and Thursdays.

1935
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:02,240
I wasn't exercising.
He hates it now.

1936
01:27:02,241 --> 01:27:07,241
He exercises and his fit that way and it
doesn't restrict his calories as much

1937
01:27:07,581 --> 01:27:10,610
cause he's physically doing something.
But uh,

1938
01:27:10,670 --> 01:27:13,490
I like the idea of not eating a day.
That whole,

1939
01:27:13,491 --> 01:27:16,130
when people say I hate exercise,
it's like people saying,

1940
01:27:16,131 --> 01:27:18,170
I hate brushing my teeth.
Like shut the fuck up.

1941
01:27:19,230 --> 01:27:22,550
What are you a baby?
Just meaning she's just,

1942
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:29,050
I don't want to brush my teeth and hate
Aa.

1943
01:27:30,890 --> 01:27:34,430
It's a no,
that's back to the couch.

1944
01:27:36,770 --> 01:27:38,610
I got breathe heavy.
Yeah.

1945
01:27:38,730 --> 01:27:40,530
Eh,

1946
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:45,940
he just fucking do it.
Shit you don't like to do.

1947
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:47,230
It's like,
I know water.

1948
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:50,680
Right.
How the fuck do you expect a jokester

1949
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:53,650
come baby?
Right.

1950
01:27:53,660 --> 01:27:57,250
And I like it just come into my head.
Come on,

1951
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:01,640
come on.
Just wait.

1952
01:28:01,641 --> 01:28:06,641
You wait in my head
muscles from a pill.

1953
01:28:14,110 --> 01:28:17,230
His name is ty,
the comedian.

1954
01:28:17,770 --> 01:28:20,140
Uh,
uh,

1955
01:28:20,141 --> 01:28:22,810
you're a crazy person.
Oh Man.

1956
01:28:22,940 --> 01:28:26,070
Oh Kevin Meeney the Great Kevin,
what did he die?

1957
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:27,610
Oh,
I think his heart,

1958
01:28:28,190 --> 01:28:31,110
he was just on his laptop and in his
living room and just,

1959
01:28:31,170 --> 01:28:32,170
just had a hard,
yeah,

1960
01:28:32,171 --> 01:28:34,330
I think so.
Fuck God,

1961
01:28:34,331 --> 01:28:36,070
he was funny.
But he would wind up like,

1962
01:28:36,071 --> 01:28:39,460
you were just like a crazy person.

1963
01:28:40,150 --> 01:28:41,950
Right.
It's not right.

1964
01:28:41,980 --> 01:28:44,650
We're big pants.
Pee Fall Dude.

1965
01:28:44,651 --> 01:28:45,590
I saw Kevin Means

1966
01:28:46,450 --> 01:28:51,450
19 days funny.
Me and my friend Diane Derosa Nice.

1967
01:28:51,881 --> 01:28:54,250
She was a friend of mine from high
school.

1968
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:57,130
Yeah.
We went to see,

1969
01:28:57,190 --> 01:29:00,460
um,
we went to see him at catch a rising

1970
01:29:00,461 --> 01:29:02,250
star in Cambridge

1971
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:07,080
and this is like,
I think maybe I had done an open Mike

1972
01:29:07,081 --> 01:29:09,090
night or maybe I hadn't even gone on
stage yet,

1973
01:29:09,330 --> 01:29:11,250
but I want to see him and I paid to see
him.

1974
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:13,080
It's great.
The comedy,

1975
01:29:13,230 --> 01:29:16,170
any crushed so hard that I could,
I could,

1976
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:18,510
I was,
it was unimaginable to me.

1977
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,910
I couldn't imagine so it could be that
funny.

1978
01:29:20,911 --> 01:29:23,910
So funny.
Cause he was in his prime then and it

1979
01:29:23,911 --> 01:29:25,080
was uh,
you know,

1980
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:29,090
maybe 180,
200 seat rooms.

1981
01:29:29,091 --> 01:29:29,730
Yeah.
You know,

1982
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:33,330
just killing ceiling pow and he's on
fire.

1983
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:36,120
No escape.
He was on fire.

1984
01:29:37,650 --> 01:29:38,840
That's not right.
Okay.

1985
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:42,070
Right.
And then I opened for him like a

1986
01:29:42,071 --> 01:29:46,600
caroline's when I was first starting and
just watching him just like destroy any

1987
01:29:46,601 --> 01:29:50,140
breaks into that coffee song.
I remember he would do the book coffee

1988
01:29:50,141 --> 01:29:52,280
song,
this song,

1989
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:54,050
this uh,
uh,

1990
01:29:54,580 --> 01:29:57,220
all the coffee in Brazil or something
like that.

1991
01:29:57,580 --> 01:30:00,370
He just,
he's just killing talking about it and

1992
01:30:00,371 --> 01:30:02,730
then all of a sudden he's doing this
musical number.

1993
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:05,020
Like this is a mattress.
Oh,

1994
01:30:05,021 --> 01:30:07,750
he just saw the coffee and all the
coffee in Brazil.

1995
01:30:07,751 --> 01:30:08,584
I think it's up

1996
01:30:09,090 --> 01:30:12,510
that he got comfortable.
He could do whatever he wanted to.

1997
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:16,290
He would set spot.
There's a spot that some comedians can

1998
01:30:16,291 --> 01:30:18,260
hit them in the fucking bow tie.

1999
01:30:23,210 --> 01:30:26,760
This is first tonight.
Show them women call me.

2000
01:30:26,770 --> 01:30:27,603
Plucky

2001
01:30:32,970 --> 01:30:36,210
you'd have to see it to really,
it also,

2002
01:30:36,211 --> 01:30:39,420
you'd have to be there in 1988,
you know,

2003
01:30:39,421 --> 01:30:41,880
to realize like how crazy what he was
doing was,

2004
01:30:41,881 --> 01:30:44,460
it was so weird.
But he got stuck.

2005
01:30:45,390 --> 01:30:49,800
He got stuck.
He went from being a fucking murderer on

2006
01:30:49,801 --> 01:30:53,010
top of the world.
Uncle buck healing in every place.

2007
01:30:53,790 --> 01:30:57,720
But he got stuck with his act.
We had like the same act for the longest

2008
01:30:57,721 --> 01:31:00,240
time and that act like it didn't work
anymore.

2009
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:02,740
Well this is cut back to what I was
talking about.

2010
01:31:02,741 --> 01:31:05,740
It's a bit of taking your eye off the
ball and like doing other things.

2011
01:31:05,741 --> 01:31:08,500
He started doing uncle buck.
He started doing some movies and the

2012
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:12,340
Nino at that time,
those people weren't so conscious that

2013
01:31:12,341 --> 01:31:15,010
you had to keep your act alive.
You know what I mean?

2014
01:31:15,070 --> 01:31:19,660
And you know you take five years off the
road and then try and come back.

2015
01:31:19,661 --> 01:31:21,400
It's,
it's not easily done.

2016
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:23,120
No.
Did you take that much time off?

2017
01:31:23,450 --> 01:31:26,120
I don't know.
I'm just ballparking but I mean,

2018
01:31:26,450 --> 01:31:28,970
you know,
his interests were other places at that

2019
01:31:28,971 --> 01:31:31,430
time.
He was doing tv shows and doing all that

2020
01:31:31,431 --> 01:31:32,990
other stuff.
It's hard.

2021
01:31:32,991 --> 01:31:36,980
You don't progress because you're not
just in it doing that stand up all the

2022
01:31:36,981 --> 01:31:37,460
time.

2023
01:31:37,460 --> 01:31:41,750
Well everyone was told back then in
particular that you had to do something

2024
01:31:41,751 --> 01:31:45,260
else.
That stand up was a vehicle that got you

2025
01:31:45,261 --> 01:31:50,261
to the big game and the big game was a
television show or a movie.

2026
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:53,870
Like when I got news radio,
one of the producers of news radio said

2027
01:31:53,871 --> 01:31:56,120
to me like,
why are you still doing standup?

2028
01:31:56,150 --> 01:31:57,170
Yeah,
you're an actor now,

2029
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:58,040
right?
Yeah,

2030
01:31:58,070 --> 01:31:58,730
sure.
On TV.

2031
01:31:58,730 --> 01:32:00,280
I was what?
Yeah.

2032
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:01,810
And I remember thinking like,
Oh my God,

2033
01:32:01,811 --> 01:32:04,900
I got to get to a comedy club right now
for this makes any sense.

2034
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,460
I know the fuck you talking about.
I mean,

2035
01:32:07,461 --> 01:32:11,720
the way we think is you do that stuff so
more people come to see your show so you

2036
01:32:11,721 --> 01:32:14,630
can keep doing your shows.
That's why you do that stuff.

2037
01:32:14,631 --> 01:32:16,110
It's not the other way around.
But they,

2038
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:21,140
that generation saw it as the standup
was not something that you buy,

2039
01:32:22,130 --> 01:32:26,300
but also to be fair,
they didn't have theater shows and other

2040
01:32:26,301 --> 01:32:28,580
avenues weren't kind of carved out where
they would,

2041
01:32:28,970 --> 01:32:30,890
could see stand up as being a special
thing.

2042
01:32:30,891 --> 01:32:35,891
They were just in these hard ass clubs
doing six shows a weekend and it's true.

2043
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:38,060
And they were like,
get me Outta here.

2044
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:40,490
When did theater shows start kicking in
for people?

2045
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:45,110
For the main,
for like just regular good comics,

2046
01:32:45,111 --> 01:32:45,944
not,
you know,

2047
01:32:46,010 --> 01:32:47,340
fairly recently.
Really?

2048
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:48,530
Yeah.
Who Was it?

2049
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:53,560
Who else was doing theaters before?
Like you know in those days?

2050
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:57,830
Well there was Kevin meaney.
If Kevin Meeney was peaking now he would

2051
01:32:57,831 --> 01:32:59,840
be running off and starting to do
theater shows.

2052
01:32:59,841 --> 01:33:04,841
But back then it was just comedy clubs
and then television.

2053
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:07,880
Yeah.
But some people did big places cause I

2054
01:33:07,881 --> 01:33:11,180
saw people in big places.
Like what kind of places?

2055
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:14,000
Like Ah,
there was theaters,

2056
01:33:14,150 --> 01:33:17,690
there's definitely rock clubs.
There was some of it,

2057
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:21,050
but there wasn't like an active touring.
When was the first time,

2058
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:23,090
man,
I'm trying to remember the first time I

2059
01:33:23,091 --> 01:33:23,924
did a theater.

2060
01:33:25,530 --> 01:33:27,630
Not that long ago.
I bet.

2061
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:31,680
Shit,
it wasn't like part of the touring

2062
01:33:31,681 --> 01:33:33,540
business.
I mean you had guys that were big,

2063
01:33:33,541 --> 01:33:35,100
they were doing it,
but it wasn't like,

2064
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:38,490
you know,
you couldn't have a guy that instead of

2065
01:33:38,550 --> 01:33:40,770
headlining at a club could just go off
and do

2066
01:33:42,330 --> 01:33:44,520
another little theater.
It was different.

2067
01:33:44,550 --> 01:33:46,620
They were like comedy was,
you know,

2068
01:33:47,010 --> 01:33:48,320
it was also a slump,
like,

2069
01:33:48,380 --> 01:33:49,680
like all the clubs were closing

2070
01:33:50,230 --> 01:33:51,340
years.
20 years.

2071
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:53,590
How many 15 years ago that started
happening.

2072
01:33:53,591 --> 01:33:54,401
Yeah.
Yeah.

2073
01:33:54,401 --> 01:33:58,270
That sounds about right.
Sounds about right lump,

2074
01:33:58,500 --> 01:33:59,740
right.
There was a comedy.

2075
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:04,010
Yeah.
When I started in 93 the comedy had had

2076
01:34:04,130 --> 01:34:04,810
fallen on it.

2077
01:34:04,810 --> 01:34:05,591
Sas.
Oh,

2078
01:34:05,591 --> 01:34:08,410
you had,
you started right when it hit right at

2079
01:34:08,411 --> 01:34:12,250
the end of it,
because I started at the tail end of the

2080
01:34:12,251 --> 01:34:16,180
boom.
The boom was like 84 and when he started

2081
01:34:16,181 --> 01:34:18,190
in [inaudible] 88 okay.
And when I started,

2082
01:34:18,191 --> 01:34:19,300
it's like people like,
ah,

2083
01:34:19,301 --> 01:34:21,010
you started about four years to like
kid.

2084
01:34:21,330 --> 01:34:22,121
All right.
Hey.

2085
01:34:22,121 --> 01:34:23,950
Yeah.
But there was still plenty of work.

2086
01:34:23,980 --> 01:34:24,880
Yeah,
there's a lot.

2087
01:34:24,910 --> 01:34:29,560
When I shut up clubs at 93 it was over.
There were a get discouraged.

2088
01:34:30,030 --> 01:34:32,700
No,
cause it was good for me because all the

2089
01:34:32,701 --> 01:34:33,660
guys' wedding,
yeah.

2090
01:34:33,661 --> 01:34:35,490
Everyone was quitting.
And I was there.

2091
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:38,520
I was working for free.
I wasn't looking to make money.

2092
01:34:38,521 --> 01:34:40,140
I was just doing it.
Yeah.

2093
01:34:40,170 --> 01:34:43,950
So all of a sudden I was able to just,
if you had a car and would drive the

2094
01:34:43,951 --> 01:34:46,440
headline or a club you could get on
stage.

2095
01:34:46,530 --> 01:34:49,930
Well there was also this weird attitude
that some people would have that land,

2096
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:53,700
like they were getting screwed because
the work was going away.

2097
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:55,140
Yeah.
Like you were getting screwed.

2098
01:34:55,141 --> 01:34:56,510
Like what?
And I remember thinking like,

2099
01:34:56,550 --> 01:34:57,980
wow,
what a way of looking

2100
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:01,190
at things that as that you are
personally getting screwed.

2101
01:35:01,191 --> 01:35:03,830
Yeah.
Because this entire industry was

2102
01:35:03,831 --> 01:35:06,740
oversaturated with a bunch of hacks.
Hacks.

2103
01:35:06,810 --> 01:35:07,643
Yeah.
Yeah.

2104
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:11,300
Real has someone was talking about is
there going to be a bus now?

2105
01:35:11,570 --> 01:35:13,670
Because there's been so much comedy out
there and stuff.

2106
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:19,400
It's not a dearth of shitty comedy now.
There's a lot of comedy,

2107
01:35:19,401 --> 01:35:22,520
but it's a lot of good comedy that's
progressing and moving forward.

2108
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:24,950
The art for a lot of booming different
voices,

2109
01:35:24,951 --> 01:35:27,500
there's a lot going on.
It's not,

2110
01:35:27,530 --> 01:35:32,530
there was a bust back then for a reason.
People had 40 minutes of material and

2111
01:35:33,741 --> 01:35:37,070
they just pounded people with it
relentlessly and they never wrote and

2112
01:35:37,071 --> 01:35:40,250
they never were traveling constantly.
It was shitty.

2113
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:43,330
Yeah.
And there was a lot of these formula

2114
01:35:43,331 --> 01:35:45,400
guys that would go,
uh,

2115
01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:48,130
you know,
they would just have some fucking like

2116
01:35:48,131 --> 01:35:53,131
really obvious premise and they would
work at like a comedian,

2117
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:57,770
say they had a way of talking him like
her comedian.

2118
01:35:58,730 --> 01:36:03,470
What is this mutual of Omaha's wild
kingdom playing out in my kitchen.

2119
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:07,400
Yeah.
Yeah.

2120
01:36:07,430 --> 01:36:09,320
Cause you said it was really funny for a
while.

2121
01:36:09,410 --> 01:36:13,400
Something's happening now.
We're French comics are getting exposed

2122
01:36:13,730 --> 01:36:18,610
for stealing American comedy verbatim
now and,

2123
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:20,470
and,
and translating to fringe like,

2124
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:25,520
and there was a video that came out
today that showed Dave Chappelle and

2125
01:36:25,521 --> 01:36:29,210
then some French comic ripping them off,
Jerry Seinfeld and then some French

2126
01:36:29,211 --> 01:36:34,010
comic rick ripping them off or ripping
them off with the same hand motions.

2127
01:36:34,011 --> 01:36:38,150
The same doing his act in French,
just doing exact and French as if they

2128
01:36:38,151 --> 01:36:41,360
were the only human beings who spoke
both English and French.

2129
01:36:41,810 --> 01:36:46,810
This was something that we had heard
about forever from the Montreal Comedy

2130
01:36:47,150 --> 01:36:47,751
Festival.
Oh really?

2131
01:36:47,751 --> 01:36:49,580
Yeah.
Because the Montreal comedy festival,

2132
01:36:49,610 --> 01:36:53,960
not the people that perform there,
but we would perform in Montreal and we

2133
01:36:53,961 --> 01:36:56,270
would talk to guys who were comics
that's,

2134
01:36:56,360 --> 01:36:58,910
that spoke English and French.
Right.

2135
01:36:59,150 --> 01:37:02,030
And a lot of the guys that spoke French,
sometimes they would tell you they did

2136
01:37:02,031 --> 01:37:03,480
French shows.
Yeah,

2137
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:04,281
I go,
I was,

2138
01:37:04,281 --> 01:37:05,180
I like,
that's weird.

2139
01:37:05,181 --> 01:37:07,370
Like you do French shows,
an English shows and they go,

2140
01:37:07,371 --> 01:37:08,300
it's interesting,
but there's,

2141
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:13,010
there's a bunch of comics that are
famous only in the French speaking world

2142
01:37:13,011 --> 01:37:17,600
of touring comedy and they just steal
from American comics and just say their

2143
01:37:17,601 --> 01:37:18,560
stuff in French.
I go,

2144
01:37:18,561 --> 01:37:19,370
no,
there's,

2145
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:20,990
oh yeah,
it's blatant.

2146
01:37:21,190 --> 01:37:21,940
Well,
and there's,

2147
01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:25,790
there's a handful of comedians that were
making a living turing,

2148
01:37:25,850 --> 01:37:28,130
so three years just stealing
everybody's,

2149
01:37:28,410 --> 01:37:29,670
I love having you here.
It is here.

2150
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:31,680
I love how they steal from the biggest
guys.

2151
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:33,900
So stupid.
Yeah.

2152
01:37:34,530 --> 01:37:38,630
Yeah.
I mean literally this is a whole kit

2153
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:41,690
while they're getting a guy from 2004 so
this is there going,

2154
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:43,770
God,
this is like a Hashtag.

2155
01:37:43,771 --> 01:37:46,770
Me Too.
It's hilarious.

2156
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:51,030
Copied comic mix.
Yeah.

2157
01:37:51,330 --> 01:37:55,920
85 or 86 to 2005 well that's Gad.
Do you know him?

2158
01:37:55,950 --> 01:37:57,510
Yeah.
How do you know him?

2159
01:37:57,750 --> 01:38:00,510
He,
they call him the Jerry Seinfeld of wow.

2160
01:38:00,610 --> 01:38:03,090
Of a France.
Well he took that shit literally.

2161
01:38:03,930 --> 01:38:05,550
He's good.
He's good friends with Jerry.

2162
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:07,560
Yeah.
Well stealing Jerry Shit.

2163
01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:10,470
Oh Man.
Yeah.

2164
01:38:10,471 --> 01:38:12,120
It's uh,
it's interesting.

2165
01:38:12,150 --> 01:38:17,150
And they're using a Hashtag copy comic
in Hashtag copy comic mix did,

2166
01:38:18,451 --> 01:38:21,960
this is like French speaking comedians
who don't do this.

2167
01:38:21,961 --> 01:38:25,590
It was like enough is enough.
You fucks and they're mad and they're

2168
01:38:25,710 --> 01:38:26,543
coming out with all,
yeah.

2169
01:38:26,550 --> 01:38:28,260
Maybe.
Maybe

2170
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:30,780
there is a real thing.

2171
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:33,360
I was thinking the other day,
I heard you talking with,

2172
01:38:33,361 --> 01:38:37,020
uh,
I think it was Neil Brennan.

2173
01:38:37,050 --> 01:38:39,240
Yeah.
Then you were talking about a Jannie.

2174
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:40,171
Richard.
Jenny.

2175
01:38:40,171 --> 01:38:42,900
Yeah.
Who I love Jenny too.

2176
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:45,780
One of the greats and then I was
underrated comedian of all time.

2177
01:38:45,781 --> 01:38:46,531
I think.
So.

2178
01:38:46,531 --> 01:38:49,590
Great.
But then when you listened to his stuff,

2179
01:38:50,310 --> 01:38:54,660
the it is very much of the time,
I think are all comedy is very much of

2180
01:38:54,661 --> 01:38:56,010
the time.
Sure.

2181
01:38:56,250 --> 01:38:59,910
It really like even our stuff from,
you know,

2182
01:38:59,911 --> 01:39:02,340
15 years ago,
it was of that moment.

2183
01:39:02,820 --> 01:39:05,640
And like you listen to Jenny and he's,
uh,

2184
01:39:06,570 --> 01:39:09,390
he's so funny and so,
but he's definitely have that ear.

2185
01:39:09,391 --> 01:39:12,300
Like if I were to try and turn my 15
year old onto to him,

2186
01:39:12,330 --> 01:39:15,180
it wouldn't fly.
I don't know.

2187
01:39:15,210 --> 01:39:18,570
I think if you,
if you made your 15 year old listen to a

2188
01:39:18,571 --> 01:39:19,800
steaming pile of me.

2189
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:21,690
Yeah,
yeah.

2190
01:39:22,350 --> 01:39:24,900
15 year old boy or girl parts of it.
Girl.

2191
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:26,311
Yeah.
Parts of it.

2192
01:39:26,311 --> 01:39:27,620
But I mean it's,
and it's not,

2193
01:39:27,660 --> 01:39:29,310
this isn't a knock,
I think.

2194
01:39:29,311 --> 01:39:29,791
No,
you're saying,

2195
01:39:29,791 --> 01:39:30,591
you know what I mean?
We,

2196
01:39:30,591 --> 01:39:34,290
it's just,
comedy is very much of the given take of

2197
01:39:34,291 --> 01:39:39,150
the culture and what's happening and
there's some stuff holds up and some

2198
01:39:39,151 --> 01:39:44,151
stuff because like,
because Richard is the first guy to do

2199
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:48,280
the lobster and their tank,
uh,

2200
01:39:48,470 --> 01:39:50,880
sandy wasn't even,
he wasn't even,

2201
01:39:51,090 --> 01:39:52,770
there was a guy in Boston that was
doing,

2202
01:39:52,780 --> 01:39:53,850
and even before him,
oh,

2203
01:39:53,860 --> 01:39:55,140
really?
Named Don Galvin,

2204
01:39:55,141 --> 01:39:59,400
who had all Gavin hilarious bit about a
lobster and a tank.

2205
01:39:59,430 --> 01:40:01,410
Oh really?
Gavin's like the king.

2206
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:04,170
He was,
he was a monster.

2207
01:40:04,330 --> 01:40:08,760
I'm a monster.
But see what happens is he breaks that,

2208
01:40:08,910 --> 01:40:13,910
he breaks that code like Righty,
comes up with that bit and then 15 years

2209
01:40:14,071 --> 01:40:17,010
later we've seen shades of it.

2210
01:40:17,430 --> 01:40:19,650
So then by the time my kid here is that,
it's like,

2211
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:20,640
oh,
that old thing.

2212
01:40:20,930 --> 01:40:25,860
And they don't realize at that moment
when Don Gavin comes up with that on his

2213
01:40:25,861 --> 01:40:29,010
way into the club,
it's genius,

2214
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:30,293
right?
Yeah,

2215
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:30,871
no,
yeah,

2216
01:40:30,871 --> 01:40:33,210
for sure.
And there was a bunch of people had

2217
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:35,770
similar premises back then.
Yeah.

2218
01:40:35,790 --> 01:40:38,700
You know,
was there was a bunch of bits about game

2219
01:40:38,701 --> 01:40:39,570
shows,
you know,

2220
01:40:39,571 --> 01:40:40,920
there was a bunch,
a bunch of bits.

2221
01:40:41,020 --> 01:40:43,380
Right.
There's a lot of different bits that

2222
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:47,670
people just had their own take on these
individual things.

2223
01:40:47,671 --> 01:40:48,360
Yeah.
Yeah,

2224
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:49,850
yeah.
Gavin,

2225
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:50,910
so funny.
Oh,

2226
01:40:50,911 --> 01:40:52,150
he was a monster.
Yeah.

2227
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:54,050
He's one of those guys that left Boston.
No.

2228
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:56,920
Yeah,
Boston was a s a dirty mistress.

2229
01:40:57,250 --> 01:40:59,040
She fucking catch you around.
Yeah.

2230
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:00,800
Crushed your dreams.
Yeah.

2231
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:05,050
It was so good there that they stayed,
stayed and have long careers though,

2232
01:41:05,051 --> 01:41:05,884
right?
Yep.

2233
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:08,400
But they should have been monsters.
Yeah.

2234
01:41:08,440 --> 01:41:10,780
Like dawn Gavin should be,
in my opinion,

2235
01:41:10,781 --> 01:41:12,910
he should be right up there with all the
greats.

2236
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:17,710
People should know him the same way they
know Robin Williams and all these other

2237
01:41:17,711 --> 01:41:20,380
standup comics that are huge.
Maybe even bigger.

2238
01:41:20,460 --> 01:41:23,410
Such a natural,
such a natural.

2239
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:25,810
So good.
Especially at the time,

2240
01:41:26,230 --> 01:41:28,420
oh my God.
In 88 when I first started,

2241
01:41:28,510 --> 01:41:31,300
Oh really?
He would show up half cocked,

2242
01:41:32,020 --> 01:41:35,440
drinking hand,
go on stage and just crush to the point

2243
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:39,420
where you just like you couldn't,
he couldn't believe how good his timing

2244
01:41:39,430 --> 01:41:40,263
was.
Yeah.

2245
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:43,730
And he had that,
that fucking Boston we had talking about

2246
01:41:44,860 --> 01:41:49,810
that Irish there right now when I
vacation I went to Puerto Rico.

2247
01:41:49,810 --> 01:41:53,380
I loved it.
But fucking so many Puerto Ricans,

2248
01:41:53,830 --> 01:41:56,590
I don't even know how they afford it.
So expensive.

2249
01:41:56,890 --> 01:41:59,440
And I'm a vegetarian and I hey meet and
shit.

2250
01:41:59,441 --> 01:42:04,441
But
it's like the timing of it was,

2251
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:10,360
everything was a throwaway and the tag
was a throwaway to another tag.

2252
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:14,860
You were laughing at Shit you couldn't
believe you were hearing and so

2253
01:42:14,861 --> 01:42:17,470
brilliant.
And then it really becomes,

2254
01:42:17,770 --> 01:42:20,650
you know,
there's certain stuff like I'll see like

2255
01:42:20,651 --> 01:42:23,770
the old,
I was watching old Jack Benny on

2256
01:42:23,771 --> 01:42:27,040
youtube,
like [inaudible] and some of it really

2257
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:29,620
is as funny as sitcoms that are out
today.

2258
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:30,491
Really?
Yes.

2259
01:42:30,491 --> 01:42:34,120
Some of it isn't.
It nails it,

2260
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:36,550
but most of it is,
like I said,

2261
01:42:36,670 --> 01:42:38,530
it's,
it just kind of dates itself.

2262
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:43,560
I was watching an ad for these Jackie
gleason dvds.

2263
01:42:44,350 --> 01:42:46,750
Jackie gleason had a show.
Yeah.

2264
01:42:46,900 --> 01:42:50,560
I didn't know you had a show and the
honeymooners was a part of that show.

2265
01:42:50,830 --> 01:42:54,130
Ah,
it was like a sketch.

2266
01:42:54,131 --> 01:42:57,110
Yeah.
So it was a variety show and that

2267
01:42:57,111 --> 01:42:58,780
they're there,
um,

2268
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:02,380
playing this ad for a DVD,
for the variety show.

2269
01:43:02,710 --> 01:43:05,320
So my wife walks into the kitchen,
I'm watching this on TV shows,

2270
01:43:05,321 --> 01:43:07,990
what the fuck are you watching?
And I'm like,

2271
01:43:07,991 --> 01:43:09,550
look at this.
This is like a time machine.

2272
01:43:09,551 --> 01:43:14,010
Like you get to watch what people
thought was amazing in 1960 or whatever

2273
01:43:14,011 --> 01:43:14,860
this was.
Yeah.

2274
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:17,120
Yeah.
Look at that that way.

2275
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:19,720
He goes,
Jackie gleason show Jackie gleason show.

2276
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:21,581
Yeah.
Look,

2277
01:43:21,581 --> 01:43:24,610
there's the honeymooners at the bottom.
Joe The bartender.

2278
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:28,150
Wow.
Fenwick Babbitt.

2279
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:31,720
Reggie Venn gleason the third.
What the fuck?

2280
01:43:32,410 --> 01:43:35,290
Just doing a whole bunch of character.
They called him the greatest.

2281
01:43:35,530 --> 01:43:40,530
He called himself the greatest CBS TV
fast.

2282
01:43:40,811 --> 01:43:42,490
Wow.
How weird.

2283
01:43:42,970 --> 01:43:44,290
Yeah.
That was his show.

2284
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:49,290
Eight to nine o'clock on Saturdays
brought to you by schick smaller.

2285
01:43:49,310 --> 01:43:51,590
Let's see if he can find a clip it.

2286
01:43:51,650 --> 01:43:52,251
Oh,
the bat.

2287
01:43:52,251 --> 01:43:53,660
So weird to watch,
man.

2288
01:43:53,661 --> 01:43:57,050
They all smoked.
They were constantly smoking like while

2289
01:43:57,051 --> 01:44:00,380
they're on the set,
they would like light up and they're

2290
01:44:00,381 --> 01:44:03,230
doing their sketches and they had like a
cigarette in their hand while they're

2291
01:44:03,231 --> 01:44:06,110
doing sketches.
A lot of them were a sponsored by the

2292
01:44:06,111 --> 01:44:07,970
cigarettes.
Oh,

2293
01:44:07,971 --> 01:44:10,490
that makes sense.
That makes sense.

2294
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:13,430
Jack Benny show,
they would stop and just start talking

2295
01:44:13,431 --> 01:44:15,470
about it.
Due to the nature of the rare,

2296
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:17,900
rare kinescope recordings utilized in
this tape.

2297
01:44:17,901 --> 01:44:21,620
Picture quality will vary in comparison
to modern video technology.

2298
01:44:21,830 --> 01:44:23,690
However,
it becomes the historical significance

2299
01:44:23,691 --> 01:44:25,670
of the subject matter.
They are included.

2300
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,140
Very nice.
Look,

2301
01:44:27,350 --> 01:44:28,071
this is it,
man.

2302
01:44:28,071 --> 01:44:30,050
This is the beginning of television
comedy.

2303
01:44:30,170 --> 01:44:31,700
Damn.
Look at what it was.

2304
01:44:31,730 --> 01:44:35,600
Looks like American scene.
Yeah.

2305
01:44:36,140 --> 01:44:37,790
Wow.
It's basically a poster.

2306
01:44:37,791 --> 01:44:40,850
You're just pushing it on a poster to
see what year this is Jamie?

2307
01:44:43,130 --> 01:44:48,130
52 62 62 so this is right around the
time or he was in the hustler.

2308
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:50,580
Oh Man.
Was that the best?

2309
01:44:50,850 --> 01:44:52,860
Look at this.
Look at that giant pack of Marlboro

2310
01:44:52,861 --> 01:44:55,700
cigarettes.
Why?

2311
01:44:55,710 --> 01:44:57,720
What does she say?
But back it up a little bit so I can

2312
01:44:57,721 --> 01:45:02,340
hear what she said about Marlborough.
Give me some volume and back it up.

2313
01:45:03,780 --> 01:45:05,280
The music.
So great.

2314
01:45:06,090 --> 01:45:07,700
I love this stuff.
New York Shit.

2315
01:45:07,701 --> 01:45:10,240
Hey,
the entertainment capital of the world.

2316
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:19,220
You get a lot to live with a moral rule
now in green.

2317
01:45:23,870 --> 01:45:28,870
I bet those cows would love to come back
and do some fucking meet two speeches.

2318
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:32,590
Imagine what kind of meat to shit was
happening back then.

2319
01:45:33,050 --> 01:45:37,310
Those were cave people
aren't Connie,

2320
01:45:38,470 --> 01:45:40,280
right?
Fun Art Carney was with him.

2321
01:45:40,490 --> 01:45:43,530
Wow.
Played Norton Tammy's mirror and his

2322
01:45:43,531 --> 01:45:47,600
orchestra and a way we've got front of a
live audience.

2323
01:45:48,810 --> 01:45:50,270
Boy,
there was nothing to look forward to

2324
01:45:50,271 --> 01:45:55,271
back then.
I mean a couple of times and then before

2325
01:45:55,971 --> 01:45:57,650
you know it,
your wife was pregnant and you had a

2326
01:45:57,651 --> 01:46:01,490
bunch of kids and yeah,
just paying your bills.

2327
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,770
Give me a goddamn laugh.
Look at this.

2328
01:46:04,310 --> 01:46:06,590
These gals running around.
It's just,

2329
01:46:07,370 --> 01:46:08,330
yeah,
you'd have a little,

2330
01:46:08,331 --> 01:46:10,350
uh,
this is showbiz.

2331
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:11,330
I mean,
this came from,

2332
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:13,460
you know,
now how you do the shit back,

2333
01:46:13,610 --> 01:46:15,980
but do you think Jackie gleason got to
bang any of these checks?

2334
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:21,200
Absolutely.
[inaudible] 60 to [inaudible] 62 I the

2335
01:46:21,201 --> 01:46:23,600
greatest,
but I mean,

2336
01:46:23,601 --> 01:46:26,480
you probably could barely get it up.
He was chain smoking chain,

2337
01:46:26,481 --> 01:46:27,620
smoking,
drinking,

2338
01:46:27,621 --> 01:46:29,510
long,
big drinker hammered all the time.

2339
01:46:29,511 --> 01:46:32,300
Big Time drinker.
And by this time it's probably deep into

2340
01:46:32,301 --> 01:46:33,230
his forties,
right?

2341
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:34,673
There's probably,
yeah.

2342
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:36,590
Grossly unhealthy.
Yeah.

2343
01:46:37,070 --> 01:46:39,650
How Sony was.
How old do you think Jackie gleason

2344
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:42,300
wasn't?
62 here he comes.

2345
01:46:42,690 --> 01:46:46,020
Yeah,
we have that face.

2346
01:46:46,050 --> 01:46:48,630
Wow.
He was the greatest,

2347
01:46:49,770 --> 01:46:52,380
but certainly was an original.
Oh Man.

2348
01:46:52,381 --> 01:46:54,180
Yeah.
Did it energy.

2349
01:46:54,210 --> 01:46:54,900
Fuck,
look at him.

2350
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:59,000
Energy Pinky ring.
When we hear some scheduling laws

2351
01:46:59,010 --> 01:47:00,360
getting laughs,
he hasn't opened his mouth.

2352
01:47:01,250 --> 01:47:06,250
I got 38 more weeks to go.
38 weeks for this coffee is bigly.

2353
01:47:12,430 --> 01:47:13,263
Okay.

2354
01:47:15,310 --> 01:47:20,310
Thank you.
How sweet it is.

2355
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:24,233
Thank you.

2356
01:47:24,410 --> 01:47:25,480
It tastes it.
Yes,

2357
01:47:25,830 --> 01:47:27,360
and she walks away.

2358
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:29,930
We keep might not be long enough.
Probably a sponsor.

2359
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:31,670
That was the joke.
Cattlemen.

2360
01:47:31,700 --> 01:47:33,730
We've got a long show.
We want to get it all in.

2361
01:47:33,731 --> 01:47:35,750
So jam I little traveling music,

2362
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:39,990
any dances,
hook it back.

2363
01:47:42,730 --> 01:47:47,730
There was no hipaa places back then.
Wow.

2364
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,680
This is the it all year.
You had the dance yet to sing.

2365
01:47:50,681 --> 01:47:53,540
You had to tell jokes,
but it's weird to watch.

2366
01:47:53,541 --> 01:47:57,910
So it was her.
Wouldn't you love to go back in time and

2367
01:47:59,020 --> 01:48:04,020
bang some hot lady from 1962
I bet it was different back then.

2368
01:48:05,110 --> 01:48:06,220
Yeah.
Wild.

2369
01:48:06,460 --> 01:48:08,620
When was birth control?
When a birth control come out?

2370
01:48:09,370 --> 01:48:14,370
Sixties so I feel like that's where
people changed what they are because

2371
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:18,310
back then there was this mad desire.
Right.

2372
01:48:18,311 --> 01:48:21,940
But there was also insane consequences
if you had sex with somebody,

2373
01:48:21,941 --> 01:48:22,331
like,
oh,

2374
01:48:22,331 --> 01:48:24,670
we met him again.
You're going to get mad of a person.

2375
01:48:24,700 --> 01:48:25,660
Yeah,
like this,

2376
01:48:25,661 --> 01:48:26,494
this,
this,

2377
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:28,630
this drive,
this poll,

2378
01:48:28,631 --> 01:48:32,890
this cyclone of lust.
It leads you to this one person.

2379
01:48:33,100 --> 01:48:35,500
Ramifications,
not just ramifications,

2380
01:48:35,501 --> 01:48:39,520
but life changing,
life altering results in consequences.

2381
01:48:39,521 --> 01:48:41,230
Right.
Then the bill comes in,

2382
01:48:41,231 --> 01:48:42,700
you have the sexual revolution.

2383
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,370
He was started bagging everywhere.
Weirdness.

2384
01:48:45,490 --> 01:48:47,230
Women were in control of their own
destiny.

2385
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:51,400
Yeah,
but just w what changed what it means to

2386
01:48:51,401 --> 01:48:52,670
have sex.
It's we,

2387
01:48:52,671 --> 01:48:55,060
it became this weirdness.
It became for pleasure.

2388
01:48:55,090 --> 01:48:56,200
Yeah.
It wasn't just to,

2389
01:48:56,201 --> 01:48:57,910
yeah.
I mean it was always for pleasure,

2390
01:48:57,911 --> 01:49:01,330
but it's always for pleasure.
But the odds of that pleasure biting you

2391
01:49:01,331 --> 01:49:02,240
in the ass,
like,

2392
01:49:02,241 --> 01:49:07,120
and people must have just assumed you're
going to have a few babies mamas by the

2393
01:49:07,121 --> 01:49:09,160
time we got to a certain age.
Right.

2394
01:49:09,190 --> 01:49:13,090
But as a woman,
if you had a baby out of wedlock,

2395
01:49:13,091 --> 01:49:15,070
you were ostracized.
Yeah.

2396
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:16,630
You were seen as,
you know,

2397
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,430
bad news.
That is crazy.

2398
01:49:18,431 --> 01:49:19,061
Right?
Yeah.

2399
01:49:19,061 --> 01:49:22,630
You were seeing the guy who wasn't,
there was nothing,

2400
01:49:22,631 --> 01:49:24,550
no reflection on Amie.
He wasn't even in the picture.

2401
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:28,780
She's just like a whore.
Fuck what a shit deal for women.

2402
01:49:28,781 --> 01:49:29,890
That is.
Yeah.

2403
01:49:31,370 --> 01:49:33,580
It's pretty bad.
Yeah.

2404
01:49:33,581 --> 01:49:38,560
But there's some people that argue that
the pill and that changing the nature of

2405
01:49:38,561 --> 01:49:41,590
sexual intercourse change the way women
interact with men,

2406
01:49:41,591 --> 01:49:46,360
which changed the way women sort of like
view themselves.

2407
01:49:47,890 --> 01:49:48,723
Yeah.

2408
01:49:48,730 --> 01:49:53,730
This is not necessarily all positive.
I was found out to be confusing argument

2409
01:49:55,950 --> 01:49:56,590
and well,
the,

2410
01:49:56,590 --> 01:49:59,810
the argument being that with,
um,

2411
01:49:59,930 --> 01:50:04,930
like that it's natural for a woman to be
very selective about who she had sex

2412
01:50:05,351 --> 01:50:08,860
with and that it's natural for a woman
to,

2413
01:50:08,890 --> 01:50:11,410
you know,
want a guy who's getting his shit

2414
01:50:11,411 --> 01:50:15,910
together and all these different factors
in place before she allows demand to

2415
01:50:15,970 --> 01:50:20,410
procreate with her,
but that the pill comes along and then

2416
01:50:20,411 --> 01:50:24,520
all of a sudden women could just have
one night stands and they could be like

2417
01:50:24,521 --> 01:50:27,310
the chicks from sex and the city and uh,
you know,

2418
01:50:27,820 --> 01:50:32,170
just bang up a storm and have no
consequences but like a guy.

2419
01:50:32,290 --> 01:50:35,830
Yeah.
But this led to like a deeply

2420
01:50:35,890 --> 01:50:40,810
unfulfilling narrative.
Never a lot of women sort of found

2421
01:50:40,811 --> 01:50:43,660
themselves repeating.
I said it's a very tortured conversation

2422
01:50:43,661 --> 01:50:46,120
because I'm not a woman because I don't
know what their actual,

2423
01:50:46,121 --> 01:50:46,250
yeah.

2424
01:50:46,250 --> 01:50:47,770
Doesn't know.
But that's also,

2425
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:51,000
that also can be set of men.
I mean just that,

2426
01:50:51,120 --> 01:50:53,020
just that scenario,
just to have sex,

2427
01:50:53,021 --> 01:50:55,480
just to,
just to keep banging and have no

2428
01:50:55,481 --> 01:50:58,040
emotional connection.
I know guy friends,

2429
01:50:58,041 --> 01:51:00,580
it ended up in a very lonely place
because of that,

2430
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:01,350
you know?

2431
01:51:01,350 --> 01:51:02,011
Well,
think of this way,

2432
01:51:02,011 --> 01:51:04,530
right?
If you're 20 and that's the case.

2433
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:05,760
Yeah.
Everybody's like,

2434
01:51:05,770 --> 01:51:06,960
oh,
he's having a good time.

2435
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:09,360
Right?
If you're 60 yeah.

2436
01:51:09,930 --> 01:51:10,980
And that's the case.
Like,

2437
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:12,000
aw,
that poor bastard.

2438
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:13,650
Yeah.
Yeah.

2439
01:51:13,651 --> 01:51:15,660
Well he does get hookers.
Yeah.

2440
01:51:15,750 --> 01:51:19,200
Brings him back to his mansion and it
seems to do coke and they dance.

2441
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:20,850
It's like,
do you remember?

2442
01:51:20,860 --> 01:51:21,693
Oh,
commit.

2443
01:51:22,650 --> 01:51:27,090
I love the picture of a 60 year old guy
just dancing in a lonely place.

2444
01:51:28,020 --> 01:51:33,020
Jack Nicholson was hair all fucked up
the whole bed.

2445
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:38,070
Had a delic first plan la with a robe.

2446
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:44,120
Yeah.
It's so funny.

2447
01:51:44,121 --> 01:51:47,670
Fucking dude.

2449
01:51:49,510 --> 01:51:51,180
It's great.
You know this guy is,

2450
01:51:51,181 --> 01:51:52,350
no,
he's in good shape.

2451
01:51:52,410 --> 01:51:53,400
Well,
he's,

2452
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:55,860
he got rid of that Gal and got a couple
more since then,

2453
01:51:56,040 --> 01:52:00,120
but he's 50 years old and he's like the
super millionaire and he makes these

2454
01:52:00,121 --> 01:52:01,780
videos.
Oh my God.

2455
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:03,600
Damn.
And Girls Dancing,

2456
01:52:04,780 --> 01:52:07,050
uh,
on yachts and shit.

2457
01:52:08,970 --> 01:52:12,300
He's like,
he's got an ankle bracelet,

2458
01:52:12,301 --> 01:52:14,490
Tattoo.
Like he's got writing around his ankle

2459
01:52:14,491 --> 01:52:19,170
that he apparently like taped over.
So then he wears like ankle bracelets to

2460
01:52:19,171 --> 01:52:23,790
cover the fact that he's got this weird
ankle like writing tattoos.

2461
01:52:23,791 --> 01:52:25,830
See that Blau old is this guy.
He's 50.

2462
01:52:27,120 --> 01:52:29,250
He's in great shape.
He's in pretty good shape.

2463

2465
01:52:36,301 --> 01:52:38,070
but he's got like writing all over his
body.

2466
01:52:38,940 --> 01:52:41,550
He's a very strange character.
This is a strange cat,

2467
01:52:41,730 --> 01:52:44,940
but he's become from these videos.
It's enormous.

2468
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:46,820
Um,

Yeah.
What's his name?

2471
01:52:49,580 --> 01:52:51,110
John Luca.
Vivace.

2472
01:52:51,170 --> 01:52:54,620
John Luca Valachi party man.
He's like the most interesting man in

2473
01:52:54,621 --> 01:52:56,090
the world.
He's a Dj too.

2474
01:52:56,091 --> 01:53:00,650
He does like international DJ stuff.
So he flies around his private jet all

2475
01:53:00,651 --> 01:53:03,100
over the world.
And of course he does probably banging

2476
01:53:03,110 --> 01:53:04,460
tannins,
doing coke,

2477
01:53:04,461 --> 01:53:05,930
dancing,
sad existence.

2478
01:53:06,020 --> 01:53:08,420
But is he happy?
I don't think so.

2479
01:53:08,421 --> 01:53:10,490
Look at those girls.
How could you be happy?

2480
01:53:11,860 --> 01:53:12,693
That's the thing.
It's like

2481
01:53:14,180 --> 01:53:19,160
that's sad if he's 50 and not sad if
he's 20 it's this weird.

2482
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:21,560
Well yeah,
it's always your own shit.

2483
01:53:21,590 --> 01:53:23,510
It's all your own projection,
you know?

2484
01:53:23,570 --> 01:53:26,120
I mean he seems like he's doing me like
he's pretty happy.

2485
01:53:26,170 --> 01:53:29,060
It's like he's dancing and back flips
into the water.

2486
01:53:29,530 --> 01:53:30,410
There it is right there.

2503
01:54:17,740 --> 01:54:21,110
Like so people watch that and watch any
hit movie this year.

2504
01:54:21,850 --> 01:54:26,850
So
there's um,

2505
01:54:28,340 --> 01:54:31,520
you never know what's going to hit kids.
There's this fucking show that my seven

2506
01:54:31,521 --> 01:54:32,920
year old loves.
Yeah.

2507
01:54:32,990 --> 01:54:37,010
And the show's called haters back off
and there's this girl named Miranda

2508
01:54:37,011 --> 01:54:39,190
something or another.
She's a youtube sensation.

2509
01:54:39,191 --> 01:54:40,420
Miranda sings.
Yeah.

2510
01:54:40,700 --> 01:54:43,430
Yeah.
She's a youtube sensation for doing

2511
01:54:43,431 --> 01:54:47,510
stuff like really badly on purpose and
pretending that she's,

2512
01:54:47,511 --> 01:54:50,000
you know,
she's killing it and she's got this

2513
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:55,480
Netflix show that I watched with them
and it's,

2514
01:54:56,090 --> 01:54:59,000
the fucking show is not a bad show.
It's an interesting show.

2515
01:54:59,001 --> 01:55:01,730
It's weird.
It's almost like a female Napoleon

2516
01:55:01,731 --> 01:55:04,280
dynamite type situation,
you know?

2517
01:55:04,281 --> 01:55:09,281
But she's talented.
But my daughter who's seven loves it and

2518
01:55:09,411 --> 01:55:13,230
she does a Miranda impression
thing.

2519
01:55:13,490 --> 01:55:16,510
Hilarious about like whatever.
She's nailed it.

2520
01:55:16,530 --> 01:55:20,570
Split some of the shows,
like she had this one about being famous

2521
01:55:20,571 --> 01:55:24,860
and about like refreshing.
I constantly refreshing her page to find

2522
01:55:24,861 --> 01:55:26,840
out how many likes and thumbs up and
thumbs down.

2523
01:55:26,841 --> 01:55:28,730
She goes.
Super depressing.

2524
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:30,920
Oh really?
She was crying,

2525
01:55:31,430 --> 01:55:34,400
her mother screaming at her,
telling her how selfish she is and the

2526
01:55:34,401 --> 01:55:35,870
whole thing is like,
it was really weird.

2527
01:55:35,871 --> 01:55:40,310
She just lives in studio city.
It's just like a actress in the valley.

2528
01:55:40,340 --> 01:55:44,070
She was balling out of control.
Now she out everywhere.

2529
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:46,500
She does live shows what kind of live
show.

2530
01:55:46,530 --> 01:55:50,760
She comes out and sings like Miranda got
all these young girls just pack the

2531
01:55:50,761 --> 01:55:52,140
place.
Yeah.

2532
01:55:52,170 --> 01:55:55,620
Yeah.
There's weird is weird money in these

2533
01:55:55,621 --> 01:55:56,700
things.
She's funny.

2534
01:55:56,701 --> 01:55:58,020
She's,
she's very like,

2535
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:01,410
that's very like question marks kind of
old school.

2536
01:56:01,411 --> 01:56:04,410
He has his big cartoon lips,
you know,

2537
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:08,900
she puts the lipstick all the way around
the limb on the outside of the lips.

2538
01:56:09,450 --> 01:56:11,070
Yeah.
It's um,

2539
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:13,230
yeah.
My kids were imitating her for awhile.

2540
01:56:13,380 --> 01:56:17,150
5 million instagram followers.
It's pictures of spaghetti in her budget

2541
01:56:17,370 --> 01:56:20,730
stuff.
It's so weird and her making weird

2542
01:56:20,731 --> 01:56:22,070
faces.
You guys,

2543
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:26,250
you guys.
But meanwhile she's nailing it with

2544
01:56:26,251 --> 01:56:28,980
seven year olds because really a seven
year old,

2545
01:56:29,010 --> 01:56:32,250
she was sick from school yesterday.
She watched it all day.

2546
01:56:32,610 --> 01:56:36,810
She fucking loves it.
I was on the tonight show once with a

2547
01:56:37,290 --> 01:56:39,660
miley cyrus.
This was like,

2548
01:56:39,661 --> 01:56:42,000
I dunno,
eight years ago or something.

2549
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:45,150
And she's so famous.
She,

2550
01:56:45,540 --> 01:56:48,600
the point where she was just completely
huge,

2551
01:56:48,601 --> 01:56:49,980
you know,
and I uh,

2552
01:56:50,370 --> 01:56:53,220
my kids came along because they wanted
to meet her and my kids were little.

2553
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:55,860
And uh,
I was like,

2554
01:56:55,861 --> 01:56:57,480
wow,
she's really nailing it.

2555
01:56:57,481 --> 01:56:59,100
She's like huge and show business and
stuff.

2556
01:56:59,101 --> 01:57:01,260
And then my kids come back,
we take a picture and she's like,

2557
01:57:01,261 --> 01:57:01,861
yeah,
okay.

2558
01:57:01,861 --> 01:57:04,770
Yeah.
And she had to like squat down to take

2559
01:57:04,771 --> 01:57:07,170
pictures with these two little people.
I was like,

2560
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:11,400
that's the price he has to pay.
What ticket for a whole day he'll be

2561
01:57:12,020 --> 01:57:14,550
squatting down and taking pictures with
little people.

2562
01:57:14,640 --> 01:57:18,540
It's bad for the lower back.
All the squatting and posing.

2563
01:57:19,170 --> 01:57:20,550
We were talking about,
um,

2564
01:57:20,610 --> 01:57:21,690
the other,
by the way,

2565
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:25,620
a bunch of people got mad that cause we
were,

2566
01:57:25,650 --> 01:57:30,650
we were talking about that Logan Paul
Guy who had taken a photo or videos with

2567
01:57:31,591 --> 01:57:33,320
dead people,
the math side,

2568
01:57:33,450 --> 01:57:35,910
the way we were discussing the Logan
Paul thing,

2569
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,110
people were saying,
I defended him.

2570
01:57:37,110 --> 01:57:38,760
I don't think I defended him.
Did I?

2571
01:57:39,270 --> 01:57:40,410
I don't think I did.
I don't remember.

2572
01:57:40,411 --> 01:57:44,610
We were high as fuck.
It was me and a red band wearing NASA

2573
01:57:44,611 --> 01:57:47,370
outfits.
Don't take it seriously by the way.

2574
01:57:47,700 --> 01:57:51,600
And uh,
I read into it more.

2575
01:57:51,601 --> 01:57:53,550
I didn't know exactly what he did,
but I run into more,

2576
01:57:53,551 --> 01:57:55,980
apparently he was mocking the body's
like there's people's,

2577
01:57:55,981 --> 01:57:59,340
like their hands were bloated and blue
and he was making fun of it all.

2578
01:57:59,341 --> 01:58:03,550
And so he's a bad guy apparently the
super cut of like everything he did and

2579
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:05,640
he did a bunch of other things on top of
that.

2580
01:58:05,641 --> 01:58:08,550
Apparently it's this thing and aware of,
well he's a creep.

2581
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:11,880
He's trying to be outrageous,
trying to get attention.

2582
01:58:11,881 --> 01:58:13,110
Totally.
And it was working.

2583
01:58:13,111 --> 01:58:15,360
He's got a ton of people.
This is the same thing though,

2584
01:58:15,361 --> 01:58:17,130
right?
It's like these people that you're like,

2585
01:58:17,131 --> 01:58:17,340
what?

2586
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:18,780
What did they do?
How do they have,

2587
01:58:18,870 --> 01:58:21,880
he's got what you find.
He's got how many millions of this and

2588
01:58:21,900 --> 01:58:25,320
that and know exactly that the guy's
brother.

2589
01:58:25,400 --> 01:58:30,400
Cause the other one who lives next to a
friend of mine bought a $7 million

2590
01:58:30,931 --> 01:58:32,430
house,
20 years old,

2591
01:58:32,670 --> 01:58:35,370
but I $7 million house.
Yeah.

2592
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:37,590
Kill calabasas killing it.
No,

2593
01:58:37,591 --> 01:58:41,130
he's one of those people that love him
and hate him equally.

2594
01:58:41,230 --> 01:58:44,140
He has.
But even the people that hate him still

2595
01:58:44,141 --> 01:58:46,210
have to see what he's doing.
It's like that kind of thing.

2596
01:58:46,240 --> 01:58:47,560
Yeah.
It's super confusing.

2597
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:48,820
Yeah.
Yeah.

2598
01:58:48,821 --> 01:58:51,150
It's celebrity.
It's just that so that,

2599
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:52,750
you know,
and he's outrageous I guess.

2600
01:58:52,751 --> 01:58:56,260
I don't know anything about them.
It's also just access like everyone has

2601
01:58:56,261 --> 01:59:00,880
access to youtube.
So what youtube is now is like a

2602
01:59:00,881 --> 01:59:02,920
television show that you keep in your
pocket.

2603
01:59:02,980 --> 01:59:04,930
Yeah.
You can just constantly,

2604
01:59:05,170 --> 01:59:06,070
yeah,
they're like,

2605
01:59:06,190 --> 01:59:10,270
there's a video that I posted yesterday
of a poor bastard.

2606
01:59:10,630 --> 01:59:15,630
This fucking guy raised a squirrel that
he kinda the cute little squarely on the

2607
01:59:16,540 --> 01:59:19,230
rehabilitated it.
And they got the little squirrel,

2608
01:59:20,190 --> 01:59:21,630
squirrel.
We're gonna,

2609
01:59:21,940 --> 01:59:25,120
everything's gonna be fine.
He's like putting it back into nature.

2610
01:59:25,450 --> 01:59:27,190
It's time.
It's about time.

2611
01:59:27,191 --> 01:59:29,290
Little Guy.
And he puts a little squirrel on the

2612
01:59:29,291 --> 01:59:30,820
tree and he's like,
you just,

2613
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:33,940
you go back your way.
Good luck where you live now.

2614
01:59:34,240 --> 01:59:38,620
And he's got the squirrel on the tree
for all of 15 seconds and the cat comes

2615
01:59:38,621 --> 01:59:43,621
along and Jackson with ridiculous speed.
I'm gonna hear the volume.

2616
01:59:43,810 --> 01:59:45,670
This is my favorite part.
It's the screaming.

2617
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:47,013
Here we go.

2618
01:59:53,950 --> 01:59:55,570
Oh,
that cat,

2619
01:59:56,680 --> 02:00:00,880
that cat was on that fucker so fast.
But cat climbs up.

2620
02:00:00,881 --> 02:00:03,160
The tree,
grabs him and just takes off.

2621
02:00:03,161 --> 02:00:05,650
Just ran with him in his mouth.
And that's like you.

2622
02:00:05,870 --> 02:00:08,590
It's more than you do in that with a
cat.

2623
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:10,830
Like if you had a cat in your mouth,
they,

2624
02:00:10,870 --> 02:00:14,020
the cat would be smaller in your mouth
in that hamster.

2625
02:00:14,190 --> 02:00:15,460
Right?
Squirrel would be,

2626
02:00:16,260 --> 02:00:20,930
that's how big the fucking cat.
So raw.

2627
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:22,840
Here it is.
Oh,

2628
02:00:22,900 --> 02:00:23,890
that's a wrap,
son.

2629
02:00:26,620 --> 02:00:29,240
Almost a million people saw it.
Cats don't give up.

2630
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:32,500
They don't give a fuck.
My cat's a killer.

2631
02:00:32,860 --> 02:00:33,970
Oh Dude.
They're ruthless.

2632
02:00:33,971 --> 02:00:36,630
Ruthless.
Ruthless just kills everything and

2633
02:00:36,631 --> 02:00:37,780
anything they can.
Yeah.

2634
02:00:37,930 --> 02:00:41,560
If you ever seen the numbers for how
many things cats kill in North America?

2635
02:00:41,590 --> 02:00:46,590
No Bill Yin's of birds.
Billions,

2636
02:00:48,220 --> 02:00:48,220
billions,
billions,

2637
02:00:48,220 --> 02:00:49,810
billions of mammals and billions of
birds.

2638
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:51,940
What's so gangsters?
They kill them and don't even eat them.

2639
02:00:52,090 --> 02:00:53,290
No,
they just kill him.

2640
02:00:53,420 --> 02:00:55,390
Yeah.
They like the sport tastes.

2641
02:00:55,420 --> 02:00:55,811
Food,
foods,

2642
02:00:55,811 --> 02:00:58,960
easy.
Cats that live in the wild or indoor

2643
02:00:58,961 --> 02:01:03,910
pets are allowed to roam outdoors.
Killed between 1.4 billion to as many as

2644
02:01:03,911 --> 02:01:08,911
3.7 billion birds in the continental US
each year says a new study that

2645
02:01:10,930 --> 02:01:15,850
escalates a decade's old debate over
feline threat to native animals and it

2646
02:01:15,851 --> 02:01:17,800
shows his cute little cat with the
burdens mouth.

2647
02:01:18,070 --> 02:01:19,300
They're monsters.
Yeah,

2648
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:22,450
and just brings him and drops him in my
kids' beds.

2649
02:01:22,590 --> 02:01:25,040
Like this question,
people also ask to cats,

2650
02:01:25,041 --> 02:01:29,590
kill birds.
I keep leaving my birds and they're

2651
02:01:29,591 --> 02:01:32,050
dead.
Fluffy would never do that,

2652
02:01:32,630 --> 02:01:35,580
sweetie.
Flat fees.

2653
02:01:37,390 --> 02:01:41,450
I didn't see a feather in its full well
there.

2654
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:42,710
You know Mike?
Yeah,

2655
02:01:42,711 --> 02:01:47,210
my cat drops road and all in my
children's hair while they sleep

2656
02:01:50,120 --> 02:01:52,940
in her bed.
Oh my God.

2657
02:01:52,970 --> 02:01:57,350
Dropped a rat in my daughter's bathroom
with a leak in her shower cap.

2658
02:01:57,650 --> 02:02:02,360
Really to mark his territory.
Now the rat was just scared shitless and

2659
02:02:02,361 --> 02:02:05,390
was running.
We couldn't still behind the toilet and

2660
02:02:05,391 --> 02:02:09,710
stuff and we finally got it out.
I might to the next day it goes to put

2661
02:02:09,711 --> 02:02:14,200
on a shower cap and it's just filled
with p rat rat pee.

2662
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:18,820
Ah,
you could fucking die from the

2663
02:02:19,550 --> 02:02:22,190
disgusting.
You know that you can get leprosy from

2664
02:02:22,191 --> 02:02:23,960
armadillos.
No,

2665
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:26,780
of course.
I don't know that it's one of the few,

2666
02:02:27,530 --> 02:02:32,090
one of the few ways that a human can
contract leprosy from an animal

2667
02:02:32,330 --> 02:02:36,590
leprosies apparently is 95% of us are
immune to leprosy.

2668
02:02:37,010 --> 02:02:40,550
But you can get leprosy from Armadillo.
Oh my God.

2669
02:02:40,580 --> 02:02:42,200
Yeah.
So if you eat an Armadillo,

2670
02:02:42,201 --> 02:02:44,480
cook the shit out of it.
Folks wear rubber gloves.

2671
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:48,770
How armadillos can spread leprosy.
That's a dinosaur too,

2672
02:02:48,771 --> 02:02:50,330
isn't it?
That tank,

2673
02:02:50,331 --> 02:02:53,990
like creatures are the only mammals
besides us known to carry leprosy.

2674
02:02:54,290 --> 02:02:55,790
Oh my Lord.
Yeah.

2675
02:02:55,791 --> 02:02:58,250
Apparently though those things taste
pretty good.

2676
02:02:59,780 --> 02:03:00,560
People,
uh,

2677
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:02,830
people eat armadillos speak to.
Yeah.

2678
02:03:02,831 --> 02:03:04,910
Yeah.
They opened him up and it's kind of a

2679
02:03:04,911 --> 02:03:08,110
fatty meat grill it and uh,
yeah,

2680
02:03:08,390 --> 02:03:11,570
people marinate it and grill it and
talking your head.

2681
02:03:11,900 --> 02:03:15,800
I mean why is a lobster delicious and
that things gross because it walks on

2682
02:03:15,801 --> 02:03:19,460
the road cause he's,
he its beady eyes at night when you're

2683
02:03:19,461 --> 02:03:22,190
driving to vegas capable.
Why is it dear delicious then?

2684
02:03:22,191 --> 02:03:26,030
Cause deers walking the road to they're
not as delicious dear.

2685
02:03:26,090 --> 02:03:27,270
Yeah.
I don't like dear so much.

2686
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:27,830
Jerry.
You,

2687
02:03:27,830 --> 02:03:29,390
you like to cooking it right?
Yeah,

2688
02:03:29,391 --> 02:03:30,830
probably not.
How come you eat and elk?

2689
02:03:30,860 --> 02:03:33,530
That's a deer elk.
It's a giant elk.

2690
02:03:33,531 --> 02:03:35,900
A giant elk is a giant deer.
What is different though?

2691
02:03:35,901 --> 02:03:39,530
Well maybe in fairness,
I haven't had deer in a long time when I

2692
02:03:39,531 --> 02:03:40,460
didn't know how to cook.

2693
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:43,970
Well also it's how people take care of
it as a big issue.

2694
02:03:43,971 --> 02:03:46,760
There's things called tarsal glands that
exists,

2695
02:03:46,790 --> 02:03:50,090
um,
on the deer's legs that are particularly

2696
02:03:50,091 --> 02:03:52,940
active when they're horny,
which is when a lot of times when you

2697
02:03:52,941 --> 02:03:56,930
hunt them,
which is called the Rut and those Tarsa

2698
02:03:56,930 --> 02:03:58,670
Glenn's,
if they're not handled correctly while

2699
02:03:58,671 --> 02:04:01,700
you're skinning the deer,
you can leak some of that stuff on the

2700
02:04:01,701 --> 02:04:06,020
meat and it'll greatly taint the way the
meat tastes.

2701
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:08,660
Maybe I had some of that.
There's that.

2702
02:04:08,661 --> 02:04:11,060
And then there's also people don't take
care of it.

2703
02:04:11,061 --> 02:04:14,180
Like from the moment they kill it and
like how long does it take before it's

2704
02:04:14,181 --> 02:04:17,600
actually cooled down and dressed?
And this was like in New Jersey,

2705
02:04:17,601 --> 02:04:19,520
I'm sure nothing was being done
correctly.

2706
02:04:19,521 --> 02:04:21,000
Problems,
nothing was done right.

2707
02:04:21,001 --> 02:04:24,050
And that's where I was born.
It's done right there.

2708
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:27,380
Born and raised.
I know exactly who killed it will party

2709
02:04:27,381 --> 02:04:29,300
an ease and any born in,
uh,

2710
02:04:29,301 --> 02:04:31,070
I was born in passaic.
Oh,

2711
02:04:31,071 --> 02:04:31,870
okay.
Yeah,

2712
02:04:31,870 --> 02:04:33,060
yeah,
yeah.

2713
02:04:33,061 --> 02:04:33,900
New Jersey.
Deers.

2714
02:04:33,940 --> 02:04:36,200
It probably is a ton of them.
Oh yeah,

2715
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:38,340
they were really,
I mean it's really

2716
02:04:38,360 --> 02:04:39,193
there every week.

2717
02:04:39,390 --> 02:04:41,220
Well,
New Jersey has an interesting situation

2718
02:04:41,221 --> 02:04:45,270
now because the new governor has decided
to stop bear hunting.

2719
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:46,660
Yeah.
New Jersey,

2720
02:04:46,950 --> 02:04:51,950
New Jersey has the highest population of
Brown bear per capita in the country.

2721
02:04:53,730 --> 02:04:56,520
Cheese New Jersey does,
which people don't,

2722
02:04:56,550 --> 02:04:58,110
that doesn't make sense to them.
Bears.

2723
02:04:58,111 --> 02:04:58,681
You're like,
wait a minute.

2724
02:04:58,681 --> 02:05:00,930
Yeah.
You say bear and New Jersey,

2725
02:05:01,650 --> 02:05:03,840
New Jersey has enormous bear population.

2726
02:05:03,870 --> 02:05:07,050
A huge am I the way we're talking about
it over the holidays,

2727
02:05:07,060 --> 02:05:09,270
my sister,
my sister had a,

2728
02:05:09,930 --> 02:05:12,540
uh,
her dog was going crazy,

2729
02:05:12,930 --> 02:05:17,930
um,
at the woodpile and my sister went and

2730
02:05:18,421 --> 02:05:22,020
put a big tarp over it.
The next day the dog is going crazy

2731
02:05:22,021 --> 02:05:26,280
again at the top at the woodpile and
she's like,

2732
02:05:26,281 --> 02:05:28,680
why is he going so,
so nuts?

2733
02:05:28,980 --> 02:05:33,450
And she goes outside to get the dog and
the a big ass bear comes out from under

2734
02:05:33,451 --> 02:05:36,210
the tarp.
This just a New Jersey just starts like

2735
02:05:36,211 --> 02:05:39,690
coming out.
She was so thankful that she didn't just

2736
02:05:39,691 --> 02:05:40,770
like poke her head under there.

2737
02:05:40,810 --> 02:05:41,980
Well,
we've played videos.

2738
02:05:41,981 --> 02:05:46,690
These two giant bears battling it out in
far rockaway where they tackle over each

2739
02:05:46,691 --> 02:05:50,800
other and they're slamming to these
garbage pails and garbage goes flying.

2740
02:05:50,801 --> 02:05:52,200
They knock over a,
um,

2741
02:05:52,270 --> 02:05:56,410
a mailbox and they go right out into
traffic and first flying all over the

2742
02:05:56,411 --> 02:05:57,320
drunk fight.
Yeah.

2743
02:05:57,340 --> 02:06:01,060
They're fighting for garbage.
It was the fight for access to these

2744
02:06:01,061 --> 02:06:03,280
areas where these people drop their
garbage off.

2745
02:06:03,310 --> 02:06:04,480
Like turf.
Yeah.

2746
02:06:04,481 --> 02:06:06,460
It's,
and this new governor,

2747
02:06:06,490 --> 02:06:07,890
because Chris away,
Chris,

2748
02:06:07,900 --> 02:06:09,550
Chris Christie,
such a Slob,

2749
02:06:09,850 --> 02:06:13,130
like people hated him so much and he was
the Republican,

2750
02:06:13,131 --> 02:06:18,131
so they hired this ultra liberal social
justice warrior type new governor who's

2751
02:06:19,541 --> 02:06:24,190
decided he has his ideological
opposition to the bear hunt.

2752
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:28,630
Even though the bear hunt in New Jersey
is like really strictly controlled by

2753
02:06:28,631 --> 02:06:31,720
wildlife biologist.
They've done it to try to keep the

2754
02:06:31,721 --> 02:06:34,630
populations healthy.
And there was also the situation that

2755
02:06:34,631 --> 02:06:37,630
happened in rutgers a couple of years
ago where a kid was killed by a bear.

2756
02:06:37,990 --> 02:06:38,621
Oh really?
Yeah.

2757
02:06:38,621 --> 02:06:40,870
One of the students at rutgers.
Yeah.

2758
02:06:40,900 --> 02:06:43,570
Sad.
[inaudible] students was a wandering

2759
02:06:43,571 --> 02:06:46,480
through the woods with his friends and
they got fucking attacked by a bear and

2760
02:06:46,481 --> 02:06:48,250
a bear killed one of the kids.
Oh my God.

2761
02:06:48,270 --> 02:06:51,190
A picture of it before it killed him to,
this happened that the stress factory

2762
02:06:52,270 --> 02:06:54,360
right next door in the parking lot.
Um,

2763
02:06:54,760 --> 02:06:57,550
Vinnie brand was there.
She was doing and he had the phone and

2764
02:06:57,551 --> 02:06:58,384
everything.

2765
02:06:58,420 --> 02:07:00,490
He was doing probably phone calls to the
bear's den

2766
02:07:04,030 --> 02:07:05,500
here.
We got your daughter down here.

2767
02:07:07,030 --> 02:07:08,140
She's really drunk,
sir.

2768
02:07:09,390 --> 02:07:11,730
So the wildlife biologist put a number
like,

2769
02:07:11,790 --> 02:07:14,880
you know,
the bears can be healthy and conflicts

2770
02:07:14,881 --> 02:07:17,610
with people can be reduced if we have,
you know,

2771
02:07:17,611 --> 02:07:20,760
the bears reduced to shutting them out.
Like it's not an issue of,

2772
02:07:21,060 --> 02:07:22,720
uh,
they're in danger.

2773
02:07:22,740 --> 02:07:24,990
Ranger not endangered in any way,
shape or form.

2774
02:07:24,991 --> 02:07:26,730
It's the opposite.
They're over abundant.

2775
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:30,060
And,
but this is a problem with people with

2776
02:07:30,061 --> 02:07:34,110
when it comes to bears or what my friend
Steve Rinella likes to call charismatic

2777
02:07:34,111 --> 02:07:38,980
megafauna and their people look at
animals and they anthropomorphize them

2778
02:07:38,981 --> 02:07:43,780
and start thinking of them as being Yogi
and booboo and our little friends that

2779
02:07:43,781 --> 02:07:46,420
live in the forest,
they don't realize like these are no,

2780
02:07:46,421 --> 02:07:47,510
these are animals,
man.

2781
02:07:47,540 --> 02:07:48,161
You,
you have to,

2782
02:07:48,161 --> 02:07:53,161
you can't have animals there.
Giant predators and close proximity to

2783
02:07:53,351 --> 02:07:57,970
human beings without monitoring and
having wildlife biologists,

2784
02:07:58,090 --> 02:08:00,250
stoic,
calm,

2785
02:08:00,490 --> 02:08:05,490
objective people who really understand
animals tell you exactly how many there

2786
02:08:05,531 --> 02:08:07,810
should be in this area and when it
becomes a problem.

2787
02:08:07,810 --> 02:08:09,790
Right.
And so they're going to have an issue in

2788
02:08:09,791 --> 02:08:13,000
New Jersey the same way they're going to
have an issue in British Columbia.

2789
02:08:13,001 --> 02:08:17,050
They outlawed Grizzly bear hunting and
British Columbia this year for the exact

2790
02:08:17,051 --> 02:08:18,520
same reason.
Oh really?

2791
02:08:18,550 --> 02:08:22,060
And they did it in British Columbia
because they're not endangered.

2792
02:08:22,410 --> 02:08:23,310
No,
no,

2793
02:08:23,311 --> 02:08:24,320
no.
It was a ton of them.

2794
02:08:24,430 --> 02:08:26,040
Ton of them.
Not only do they not endangered,

2795
02:08:26,050 --> 02:08:29,050
but the people that voted on it are the
people that live in Vancouver where

2796
02:08:29,051 --> 02:08:31,990
there are new grizzly bears.
But Vancouver,

2797
02:08:32,020 --> 02:08:35,740
even though it's the population center
of a British Columbia,

2798
02:08:35,770 --> 02:08:40,120
it's where all the people live.
It's by no means representative of what

2799
02:08:40,121 --> 02:08:44,440
most of British Columbia looks like.
It's a British Columbia's woods forest.

2800
02:08:44,441 --> 02:08:47,590
And those people have to deal with
fucking grizzly bears,

2801
02:08:48,340 --> 02:08:50,590
grizzly bears.
So they said they're not allowed to hunt

2802
02:08:50,591 --> 02:08:52,120
them at all and a lot of them anymore
now.

2803
02:08:52,150 --> 02:08:55,840
And so also it's a big part of their
economy because there's a lot of these

2804
02:08:55,841 --> 02:08:59,200
people that made a living by guiding
people on these grizzly bear hunts.

2805
02:08:59,580 --> 02:09:02,380
Uh,
and it's gonna also devastate the

2806
02:09:02,381 --> 02:09:06,560
economy when it comes to their moose and
elk hunting populations too.

2807
02:09:07,420 --> 02:09:09,550
Because a lot of people went there to
moose hunt,

2808
02:09:09,551 --> 02:09:11,440
elk hunt and deer hunt,
but the bears.

2809
02:09:11,441 --> 02:09:13,180
So why did the populations are going to
go up.

2810
02:09:13,181 --> 02:09:16,240
The bears are going to start eating more
moose and elk and deer.

2811
02:09:16,510 --> 02:09:20,680
So what's their reason?
Animal rights activists have been

2812
02:09:20,681 --> 02:09:24,550
infiltrated the government and these
people that are like leaning left and

2813
02:09:24,551 --> 02:09:27,640
have sort of a delusional perception of
what wildlife is.

2814
02:09:27,970 --> 02:09:32,320
They've decided to push these laws
through that people didn't vote on.

2815
02:09:32,321 --> 02:09:33,730
By the way,
this is not like something,

2816
02:09:33,731 --> 02:09:37,180
there was this giant statewide vote and
people decided to end grizzly bear

2817
02:09:37,181 --> 02:09:38,140
hunts.
Well,

2818
02:09:38,141 --> 02:09:42,460
what's crazy about the Jersey thing is
it he just gotten an office and the bear

2819
02:09:42,461 --> 02:09:46,900
problems this years it's been a problem,
but that's while you're hunting.

2820
02:09:47,200 --> 02:09:51,460
Well,
I think that people are doing it for the

2821
02:09:51,461 --> 02:09:53,590
right reasons.
I think they're wrong,

2822
02:09:53,710 --> 02:09:55,150
but they're doing it for the right
reasons.

2823
02:09:55,151 --> 02:09:58,000
They're doing it because they think that
hunting's cruel and they're doing it

2824
02:09:58,001 --> 02:10:01,810
because they think that these are trophy
hunts and that people that there's no,

2825
02:10:01,811 --> 02:10:05,110
there was no merit to it,
but what they don't understand is you're

2826
02:10:05,111 --> 02:10:08,920
probably going to have to hire people to
kill these bears anyway,

2827
02:10:08,921 --> 02:10:10,930
which is what we do in California.
You know,

2828
02:10:10,931 --> 02:10:15,610
California Mountain Lion hunting was
outlawed in the 1990s but since then

2829
02:10:15,611 --> 02:10:18,370
they spent millions of dollars killing
mountain lions every year.

2830
02:10:18,490 --> 02:10:20,320
Oh really?
Not millions every year.

2831
02:10:20,321 --> 02:10:24,280
But what they sell downs overall,
a crew to go get a send out professional

2832
02:10:24,281 --> 02:10:29,220
hunters with dogs usually to go after
problem mountain lions and the ones that

2833
02:10:29,230 --> 02:10:32,290
go after,
almost all of them have pets and their

2834
02:10:32,291 --> 02:10:33,830
stomach.
Oh really?

2835
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:36,860
That's what they eat.
I hey dogs.

2836
02:10:37,190 --> 02:10:37,890
Really?
Yeah.

2837
02:10:37,890 --> 02:10:39,110
It's a big part of their diet.

2838
02:10:41,500 --> 02:10:43,190
We can,
we have to control.

2839
02:10:43,250 --> 02:10:45,060
I mean it's fucked up.
Yeah.

2840
02:10:45,340 --> 02:10:46,130
Well No,
we're,

2841
02:10:46,130 --> 02:10:47,840
we're in their world.
Yes.

2842
02:10:47,900 --> 02:10:51,350
But it's not their world anymore.
Just like it's not,

2843
02:10:51,470 --> 02:10:53,960
you know,
this isn't where the fucking dinosaurs

2844
02:10:53,961 --> 02:10:56,540
live either stupid or we build homes all
through here.

2845
02:10:56,570 --> 02:10:57,470
Change.
Yeah.

2846
02:10:57,680 --> 02:11:01,130
And right now we live here and I'm more
concerned about us than I am with a God

2847
02:11:01,131 --> 02:11:04,550
damn mountain lions in there.
They just ate fluffy mountain lions.

2848
02:11:04,551 --> 02:11:05,540
You say fluffy.
You fuck.

2849
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:08,770
Are there a lot of mountain lions?
Like is it the number is big or

2850
02:11:08,780 --> 02:11:10,350
California has good numbers.
Yeah.

2851
02:11:10,580 --> 02:11:15,470
My friend works at to hone ranch and
they have it to hone ranch just outside

2852
02:11:15,471 --> 02:11:17,270
of Bakersfield,
which you went about an hour and a half

2853
02:11:17,271 --> 02:11:19,070
from here.
And they have a,

2854
02:11:19,071 --> 02:11:21,020
um,
what it was called trail camera.

2855
02:11:21,110 --> 02:11:23,860
That's a post out in front of a,
um,

2856
02:11:24,190 --> 02:11:27,350
a,
a pond and out of this one pond they got

2857
02:11:27,351 --> 02:11:30,020
pictures of 16 different mountain lines.

2858
02:11:30,050 --> 02:11:32,500
Wow.
Do you ever run into him when you go up

2859
02:11:32,501 --> 02:11:33,530
and no,
Ron,

2860
02:11:33,531 --> 02:11:36,350
your runs.
I've seen mountain lions twice in my

2861
02:11:36,351 --> 02:11:40,220
life.
One I saw in Colorado and one I saw in

2862
02:11:40,221 --> 02:11:43,010
Santa Barbara,
I saw one in Montecito in a car.

2863
02:11:43,190 --> 02:11:44,840
I was driving,
it was driving,

2864
02:11:45,700 --> 02:11:47,750
it was,
it had tunes on,

2865
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:52,900
it was listening to Miley Cyrus.
I was in the car and I saw this thing

2866
02:11:53,181 --> 02:11:56,390
and I thought it was a coyote.
It was running across the road and know,

2867
02:11:56,540 --> 02:12:00,890
Oh look at its tail.
I saw this big thick bouncy tail.

2868
02:12:00,891 --> 02:12:01,790
And I'm like,
oh my God,

2869
02:12:01,791 --> 02:12:03,620
it's a cat.
And I realized a,

2870
02:12:04,730 --> 02:12:05,930
Geez,
it was weird.

2871
02:12:06,370 --> 02:12:08,270
It's weird,
but I'm looking at something for a

2872
02:12:08,271 --> 02:12:10,880
second,
two seconds maximum,

2873
02:12:10,910 --> 02:12:14,230
right.
What I'll find the cat.

2874
02:12:15,670 --> 02:12:16,430
What do you got,
Jamie?

2875
02:12:16,430 --> 02:12:20,000
Oh,
Jesus Christ wildlife camera catches

2876
02:12:20,060 --> 02:12:23,020
uncolored mountain lion roaming the
Hollywood hills.

2877
02:12:23,150 --> 02:12:23,871
I'm like,
God,

2878
02:12:23,871 --> 02:12:27,170
that looks the size of that fucker.
That is like,

2879
02:12:27,171 --> 02:12:31,390
yeah,
that's like from Africa and this is just

2880
02:12:31,390 --> 02:12:34,130
a couple of months ago was October 31st
that's right by pauly shore's house.

2881
02:12:34,610 --> 02:12:36,230
It is pauly shore.
Pauly shore.

2882
02:12:36,231 --> 02:12:38,360
It turns into that at night when no
one's watching it,

2883
02:12:38,361 --> 02:12:40,490
so I held the light twice down.
Hardly working.

2884
02:12:41,330 --> 02:12:44,840
Most of the time it's just,
that's crazy.

2885
02:12:44,841 --> 02:12:46,640
That's like something you'd see on
Safari.

2886
02:12:46,730 --> 02:12:48,440
It's a big one too.
Boy.

2887
02:12:48,620 --> 02:12:50,630
Look at the muscles and the fucker.
This is,

2888
02:12:50,690 --> 02:12:55,640
this is a halloween 2017 yeah,
craze.

2889
02:12:56,150 --> 02:12:58,340
That is our uncolored mountain lions
had,

2890
02:12:58,370 --> 02:12:59,990
it means they don't even know where this
one game for.

2891
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:03,440
Oh my God.
I mean that's the Hollywood hills.

2892
02:13:03,441 --> 02:13:05,030
That's like right next to people's
homes.

2893
02:13:05,090 --> 02:13:07,550
Well,
I stick my dog to a dog park up there.

2894
02:13:07,820 --> 02:13:10,430
A dog park.
That's a awful laurel one.

2895
02:13:10,431 --> 02:13:12,800
There's a dog park,
a at the top of Laurel,

2896
02:13:12,801 --> 02:13:13,690
like right when you go dead.

2897
02:13:13,690 --> 02:13:16,100
If you coming up over studio city,
when you go down,

2898
02:13:16,310 --> 02:13:19,670
there's a dog park out there.
If you go to the right and one of the,

2899
02:13:19,730 --> 02:13:22,880
they had a big sign there that said,
be on the lookout for mountain lions.

2900
02:13:22,881 --> 02:13:25,110
If mountain lions attack you fight back.
And I'm like,

2901
02:13:25,111 --> 02:13:25,620
God,
no,

2902
02:13:25,620 --> 02:13:27,750
fuck am I looking at here?
She's,

2903
02:13:28,330 --> 02:13:31,440
I just want to go for a run.
I'm just here to Hollywood,

2904
02:13:32,110 --> 02:13:36,870
my dog taking my dog to the park and
sort of see some girls and throw the

2905
02:13:36,871 --> 02:13:38,430
ball around.
That's

2906
02:13:40,350 --> 02:13:43,890
a lot of that is just because of our
attitude about these animals and that's

2907
02:13:43,891 --> 02:13:46,410
also why you see very few deer in
California.

2908
02:13:46,530 --> 02:13:51,530
So there's like pros and cons.
The pro is you very rarely get in

2909
02:13:52,471 --> 02:13:56,530
accidents with deer like Eww,
that's so uncommon in California.

2910
02:13:56,531 --> 02:13:58,170
That's true.
And it's because of mountain lions.

2911
02:13:58,200 --> 02:14:01,410
I always figured they just weren't a
indigenous to the area.

2912
02:14:01,440 --> 02:14:02,550
Oh No,
they're everywhere.

2913
02:14:02,551 --> 02:14:04,530
They used to be way more of them when I
first moved here.

2914
02:14:04,550 --> 02:14:05,371
Really?
Yeah,

2915
02:14:05,371 --> 02:14:06,510
man.
When I moved,

2916
02:14:07,500 --> 02:14:12,500
I moved to the valley in 94 and I see
deer all the time.

2917
02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:15,780
All the time.
You seem in the Hollywood hills all the

2918
02:14:15,781 --> 02:14:17,730
time.
I've never seen a deer here.

2919
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:21,030
I see.
I saw him a couple of days ago out in

2920
02:14:21,750 --> 02:14:24,160
thousand oaks area here.
Yeah,

2921
02:14:24,210 --> 02:14:28,710
but they're very rare in California.
Anywhere else like this?

2922
02:14:28,711 --> 02:14:31,250
Like if you're in long island.
Oh yeah.

2923
02:14:31,251 --> 02:14:34,080
Highland is a giant problem with deer
everywhere.

2924
02:14:34,081 --> 02:14:36,810
Everywhere.
Higher snipers go take care of them.

2925
02:14:36,811 --> 02:14:37,860
She,
they do.

2926
02:14:38,010 --> 02:14:40,620
They're all over New Jersey.
They felt like a pass everywhere.

2927
02:14:40,650 --> 02:14:44,430
It's like mosquitoes because they don't
have any predators like mountain lions

2928
02:14:44,840 --> 02:14:47,030
or coyotes or very,
very few coyotes.

2929
02:14:47,031 --> 02:14:49,230
And the natural order is why we don't
see him.

2930
02:14:49,560 --> 02:14:51,840
Well,
it's because here they've kind of got a

2931
02:14:51,841 --> 02:14:54,030
point.
And that point is you can let the

2932
02:14:54,031 --> 02:14:56,160
mountain lines take care of the
population.

2933
02:14:56,220 --> 02:15:00,060
And then when the mountain lions come
into a problem,

2934
02:15:00,240 --> 02:15:02,460
when they've come problem that you can
get something called the depredation

2935
02:15:02,461 --> 02:15:07,140
permit,
which a woman got in the Malibu

2936
02:15:07,141 --> 02:15:12,141
mountains because she ran an Alpaca farm
and these mountain lion one mountain

2937
02:15:12,601 --> 02:15:16,590
lion killed like I think 10 or 11
alpacas and a goat.

2938
02:15:16,740 --> 02:15:19,830
Oh my God.
In one session and one session.

2939
02:15:19,860 --> 02:15:22,020
And it was the same thing.
It's like we were talking about cats

2940
02:15:22,021 --> 02:15:23,200
with house cats.
They just canceled.

2941
02:15:23,220 --> 02:15:25,100
It just killed him.
[inaudible] me.

2942
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:27,220
She had a good old time.
Oh,

2943
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:30,390
I'll pack a pen,
couldn't help himself,

2944
02:15:30,930 --> 02:15:34,530
Jack and all of them,
but when this woman got a depredation

2945
02:15:34,531 --> 02:15:38,490
permit to kill the mountain line,
she got a ton of death threats from

2946
02:15:38,491 --> 02:15:39,180
people.

2947
02:15:39,180 --> 02:15:40,320
They were saying,
you fucking bitch.

2948
02:15:40,321 --> 02:15:41,880
I'll kill you.
You touch that cat.

2949
02:15:41,881 --> 02:15:42,930
And then she's like,
fuck this.

2950
02:15:42,931 --> 02:15:44,310
I'm not doing anything.
She,

2951
02:15:44,311 --> 02:15:46,000
she felt very exposed.
People who were,

2952
02:15:46,020 --> 02:15:48,180
she were,
they knew where her farm was.

2953
02:15:48,660 --> 02:15:49,800
Jeez.
Yeah.

2954
02:15:49,980 --> 02:15:51,450
It's scary.
She fuck.

2955
02:15:51,600 --> 02:15:53,670
Yeah.
People get really nutty,

2956
02:15:53,671 --> 02:15:55,020
man.
When it comes to animals,

2957
02:15:55,710 --> 02:15:59,010
they get a week,
but it's certain animals,

2958
02:15:59,070 --> 02:16:01,380
right?
Like these people have this weird thing

2959
02:16:01,381 --> 02:16:04,710
about that squirrel and then the cat
came along,

2960
02:16:04,711 --> 02:16:06,630
killed that fucking scroll.
Guess what bitch?

2961
02:16:06,750 --> 02:16:08,540
You've been feeding that cat,
right?

2962
02:16:08,760 --> 02:16:12,720
That's yours.
You made that monster and you let that

2963
02:16:12,721 --> 02:16:15,210
thing roam around outside,
which is just,

2964
02:16:15,211 --> 02:16:17,940
you're asking for it to kill everything
it runs into.

2965
02:16:18,030 --> 02:16:19,590
That's what they do.
It's what they do.

2966
02:16:19,610 --> 02:16:21,660
Yeah.
And it's probably super charged up about

2967
02:16:21,661 --> 02:16:24,990
it too because he gets to do it all the
time and the pride in front of it's

2968
02:16:24,991 --> 02:16:26,730
family to do it for the family.

2969
02:16:26,730 --> 02:16:28,230
That's what they like the most.
Yeah.

2970
02:16:28,231 --> 02:16:32,380
That cat did that in front of you
because that's what he wants you to see.

2971
02:16:32,410 --> 02:16:33,850
Right.
They look at me.

2972
02:16:33,880 --> 02:16:37,000
Oh,
it's scary.

2973
02:16:37,080 --> 02:16:37,721
It is.
Hey,

2974
02:16:37,721 --> 02:16:40,300
I saw the tank.
You want to try it some day?

2975
02:16:40,780 --> 02:16:42,010
What do you wanna try it?
I don't know.

2976
02:16:42,011 --> 02:16:43,630
When can I?
Um,

2977
02:16:43,950 --> 02:16:45,140
well,
well,

2978
02:16:45,250 --> 02:16:47,650
we'll work something out.
We'll come up with a a time where you

2979
02:16:47,651 --> 02:16:48,610
can come in.
We should have,

2980
02:16:48,611 --> 02:16:49,990
I should have had you come in early
today.

2981
02:16:49,991 --> 02:16:51,970
You could done it before the podcast.
Oh really?

2982
02:16:52,090 --> 02:16:53,590
Yeah.
How long do you go in there?

2983
02:16:54,190 --> 02:16:57,160
I like to do at least an hour.
Last time I did a,

2984
02:16:57,161 --> 02:16:58,900
just a couple days ago that did two
hours,

2985
02:16:59,260 --> 02:17:02,020
just floating there for an hour and it's
climbing.

2986
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:04,210
Relax,
listen to music or silence.

2987
02:17:04,240 --> 02:17:08,050
I silent your silence.
I'd log it like that.

2988
02:17:08,080 --> 02:17:09,460
Yeah,
I'd like to try it.

2989
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:11,410
Yeah,
we'll do it next time for sure.

2990
02:17:11,950 --> 02:17:13,060
That'd be cool.
For sure.

2991
02:17:13,960 --> 02:17:15,820
This facility is amazing.
It's pretty crazy,

2992
02:17:15,821 --> 02:17:16,810
right?
It's so great.

2993
02:17:17,500 --> 02:17:19,450
I figured fuck it.
Why not?

2994
02:17:19,451 --> 02:17:20,380
Right.
So great.

2995
02:17:21,010 --> 02:17:23,520
To me it was one of those things where,
Oh look,

2996
02:17:23,530 --> 02:17:25,460
all right,
if I could just do whatever I wanted to

2997
02:17:25,461 --> 02:17:26,800
do,
what would I do right?

2998
02:17:27,070 --> 02:17:28,000
Then I go,
wait a minute.

2999
02:17:28,630 --> 02:17:29,890
I think I could do whatever I want to
hear.

3000
02:17:30,660 --> 02:17:33,370
Like I should just do it.
It's really great Jamie.

3001
02:17:33,371 --> 02:17:36,250
So she saw me a gym membership.
I'm going to start working on,

3002
02:17:36,260 --> 02:17:37,510
you know,
did you get a key fob?

3003
02:17:39,610 --> 02:17:41,170
Yeah,
it's pretty Shim equipment actually

3004
02:17:41,171 --> 02:17:42,220
comes this week.
It's,

3005
02:17:42,350 --> 02:17:43,900
it's,
it's insane.

3006
02:17:44,200 --> 02:17:46,870
It was just like a whole,
it's like a gym.

3007
02:17:47,380 --> 02:17:50,100
It
can we,

3008
02:17:50,101 --> 02:17:54,100
I have an apartment.
Well it would be a real gym next week

3009
02:17:54,130 --> 02:17:58,330
cause rogue athletics is outfitting it.
Like a real gem.

3010
02:17:58,650 --> 02:18:02,820
That'd be a rowing machine.
There's going to be an Airdyne bike is

3011
02:18:02,830 --> 02:18:07,830
going to be a squat cage and she's full
range of kettlebells and fucking steel

3012
02:18:08,981 --> 02:18:10,680
plates and that.
Yeah,

3013
02:18:10,890 --> 02:18:12,580
they're doing the whole thing.
Fuck

3014
02:18:15,470 --> 02:18:17,740
is awesome.
Well,

3015
02:18:17,870 --> 02:18:20,890
you can go to the gym and get annoyed or
it could just work out here.

3016
02:18:21,700 --> 02:18:22,550
Why not?
Yeah.

3017
02:18:22,990 --> 02:18:25,570
Just come on by.
What's the sauna?

3018
02:18:26,590 --> 02:18:28,840
The Sauna and then in a house.
Yes.

3019
02:18:28,870 --> 02:18:30,280
You could for sure.
Yeah.

3020
02:18:30,281 --> 02:18:33,310
If you have the room for it and they
have varying sizes of Saunas that they

3021
02:18:33,320 --> 02:18:34,270
did a big one.
Yeah.

3022
02:18:34,271 --> 02:18:36,700
That is pretty quite honestly that,
that one's too big for me.

3023
02:18:36,700 --> 02:18:38,440
I mean I've only gone in Indian by
myself.

3024
02:18:38,470 --> 02:18:39,370
Yeah.
But,

3025
02:18:39,371 --> 02:18:41,530
uh,
you could have couple people in there in

3026
02:18:41,531 --> 02:18:43,480
that one.
So the idea of that one was,

3027
02:18:43,570 --> 02:18:46,480
what was that room?
It was like a closet before that we

3028
02:18:46,481 --> 02:18:48,370
turned it into a sauna.
Yeah.

3029
02:18:48,700 --> 02:18:49,533
Yeah.
Right.

3030
02:18:50,620 --> 02:18:54,640
Um,
we just decided like this is a spot like

3031
02:18:54,670 --> 02:18:55,503
that.
Why?

3032
02:18:55,810 --> 02:18:57,190
Okay.
Put it there.

3033
02:18:57,310 --> 02:18:58,770
Can you just run that size?
Oh really?

3034
02:18:58,780 --> 02:19:01,040
And apparently they make them all sorts
of different sizes,

3035
02:19:01,041 --> 02:19:01,940
so they do.
Yeah.

3036
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:03,670
And uh,
it fit perfect,

3037
02:19:04,060 --> 02:19:05,470
dude.
Here's the thing.

3038
02:19:05,471 --> 02:19:06,810
I've been dealing with,
um,

3039
02:19:07,060 --> 02:19:10,960
tendinitis in my elbow and it was,
it's really been kind of annoying.

3040
02:19:10,990 --> 02:19:13,600
It's really been Bob 10 to nine.
This is a weird one man.

3041
02:19:13,820 --> 02:19:15,520
And have you ever gotten it before?
No.

3042
02:19:15,700 --> 02:19:18,880
I have a,
what they called Golf Golfer's elbow,

3043
02:19:19,240 --> 02:19:21,610
the inside where tennis elbows,
the outside.

3044
02:19:22,480 --> 02:19:25,510
It's been annoying me for a few months
now and uh,

3045
02:19:25,511 --> 02:19:30,350
it comes from a overdoing chin up.
So I was doing too many chin ups and I

3046
02:19:30,351 --> 02:19:33,320
was being a meathead where I was just
pushing through,

3047
02:19:34,240 --> 02:19:36,010
you know,
like it would start to annoy me and I

3048
02:19:36,011 --> 02:19:37,580
would just keep going.
Right.

3049
02:19:38,900 --> 02:19:43,900
But one session in the sauna
significantly reduced like the pain in

3050
02:19:44,901 --> 02:19:47,150
it.
And then the second session did the same

3051
02:19:47,151 --> 02:19:50,120
thing and then I did it again yesterday
and I'm like,

3052
02:19:50,690 --> 02:19:54,080
I barely feel that tendinitis now for
real.

3053
02:19:54,140 --> 02:19:56,480
Yeah.
And so just getting the inflammation

3054
02:19:56,481 --> 02:19:57,500
out.
Yeah,

3055
02:19:57,501 --> 02:20:01,220
I think it has a,
I think it just has an overall effect on

3056
02:20:01,221 --> 02:20:03,500
inflammation throughout your whole body.
You know?

3057
02:20:03,501 --> 02:20:04,730
It's pretty cool.
Yeah.

3058
02:20:04,850 --> 02:20:06,800
You got a spare set onto where you can
climb in today?

3059
02:20:06,830 --> 02:20:08,600
I'm going in right after the show.
No.

3060
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:17,000
What does this one James?
Like a personal infrared.

3061
02:20:17,030 --> 02:20:19,110
These are like probably 1500 bucks I
think,

3062
02:20:19,111 --> 02:20:23,280
or less.
You just throw it in your house and they

3063
02:20:23,281 --> 02:20:24,210
also make,
um,

3064
02:20:24,290 --> 02:20:25,710
um,
were you,

3065
02:20:25,711 --> 02:20:27,420
uh,
you lie down in them.

3066
02:20:27,540 --> 02:20:29,820
That's ridiculous.
They have one.

3067
02:20:29,880 --> 02:20:33,210
I was lie down in it like a suit and a
use.

3068
02:20:33,211 --> 02:20:34,380
Zip it up.
Up to your neck.

3069
02:20:34,381 --> 02:20:37,350
Let's see that one with the blue down
there with that lined lying down is keep

3070
02:20:37,351 --> 02:20:38,520
going.
Scroll down.

3071
02:20:38,521 --> 02:20:40,470
Scroll down.
That one with the blue.

3072
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:41,670
You're your cursor's,
right?

3073
02:20:41,700 --> 02:20:42,900
Yeah,
that,

3074
02:20:42,960 --> 02:20:44,250
that's ridiculous.
Yeah.

3075
02:20:44,280 --> 02:20:47,740
You climb like gold.
It's like the old brady bunch of cafes.

3076
02:20:47,741 --> 02:20:50,700
He gets up your body and it's apparently
really good for you.

3077
02:20:50,730 --> 02:20:53,550
Really?
You look like she looks like the

3078
02:20:53,551 --> 02:20:55,510
Blueberry and Willy Wonka.
That's her pussy.

3079
02:20:55,640 --> 02:20:57,000
Pussy pussies.
Oh my God.

3080
02:20:57,001 --> 02:20:57,930
It's on fire.

3081
02:21:00,160 --> 02:21:05,090
She's on fire.
It looks chic.

3082
02:21:05,290 --> 02:21:07,600
I like a nice sauna.
It's great hot.

3083
02:21:07,660 --> 02:21:09,870
I don't like the steam so much.
Hmm.

3084
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:11,370
Uh,
I think there's benefits

3085
02:21:11,450 --> 02:21:14,210
steam too,
but the real benefit of the sauna is the

3086
02:21:14,211 --> 02:21:17,330
fact that you can get to 176 degrees in
a dry heat.

3087
02:21:17,870 --> 02:21:21,920
Your body can tolerate it.
But if you got to 176 degrees and steam

3088
02:21:21,921 --> 02:21:23,930
your fucking Nipples,
a burn on fire,

3089
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:27,580
right.
That you'd feel the wet because you

3090
02:21:27,650 --> 02:21:29,060
basically be poaching yourself.

3091
02:21:29,090 --> 02:21:31,790
Right.
My friend really believes in the steam

3092
02:21:31,980 --> 02:21:35,000
steam.
He's a big drinker and he steams every

3093
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,940
morning and it just all comes out of,
it's how I've been.

3094
02:21:38,630 --> 02:21:40,580
Please.
That's dying.

3095
02:21:42,650 --> 02:21:47,450
Big drinkers are all just ways of
managing the big drinking.

3096
02:21:47,720 --> 02:21:50,060
Yeah.
He just got steam it out.

3097
02:21:50,061 --> 02:21:50,894
I'm all right.

3098
02:21:51,140 --> 02:21:54,410
I think Sano will probably help more if
he could figure out a way to not.

3099
02:21:54,411 --> 02:21:56,030
I mean,
I think he's probably getting some

3100
02:21:56,031 --> 02:22:00,020
benefit from like being in the steam,
but I bet sauna would be even better for

3101
02:22:00,021 --> 02:22:01,790
him.
And it's again the same thing.

3102
02:22:01,791 --> 02:22:03,430
Reducing inflammation.
Yeah.

3103
02:22:03,890 --> 02:22:06,320
I'd like to be less puffy from
inflammation.

3104
02:22:06,360 --> 02:22:09,950
Russians love it.
Five time champion.

3105
02:22:09,980 --> 02:22:14,540
Timo cow.
Conan had become adept at enduring the

3106
02:22:14,541 --> 02:22:19,541
tournament's 110 degrees Celsius.
203 Fahrenheit heat lasting over 16

3107
02:22:20,031 --> 02:22:22,970
minutes.
She 2003 but he died,

3108
02:22:22,971 --> 02:22:24,550
didn't he?
Next guy that the guy who we're

3109
02:22:24,551 --> 02:22:26,070
competing,
they

3110
02:22:26,080 --> 02:22:27,480
have poses a competition,
right?

3111
02:22:27,510 --> 02:22:29,100
Yeah.
World's Sauna Championship.

3112
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:32,010
Oh my God,
what the Fuck is wrong with people?

3113
02:22:32,340 --> 02:22:37,050
Come on.
I'm a the very best at cooking myself,

3114
02:22:37,051 --> 02:22:39,600
but not dying.
16 minutes.

3115
02:22:39,601 --> 02:22:41,850
That's not long.
230 degrees.

3116
02:22:41,851 --> 02:22:42,684
Let me tell you something,
man.

3117
02:22:42,690 --> 02:22:46,680
I was at 210 degrees.
I can't even fucking imagine someone

3118
02:22:46,681 --> 02:22:50,790
going 20 degrees hotter than that like
my nipples were hurting and I was like,

3119
02:22:50,791 --> 02:22:53,820
why my nipple so hard?
Why they were so sore.

3120
02:22:53,850 --> 02:22:57,690
Why did you do that watch?
I cranked it up and then I came in here

3121
02:22:57,691 --> 02:23:01,350
to do my ads and when I did the ads,
I left it on too long.

3122
02:23:01,351 --> 02:23:03,960
I just got super hot.
That's my jam.

3123
02:23:04,200 --> 02:23:09,030
It says that this one guy goes in for
bursts of 130 to 140 degrees Celsius.

3124
02:23:09,031 --> 02:23:11,910
I just looked that up.
That's 284 degrees Fahrenheit,

3125
02:23:12,300 --> 02:23:14,550
four minute bursts,
todd,

3126
02:23:14,790 --> 02:23:18,810
280 degrees,
four minute bursts,

3127
02:23:19,080 --> 02:23:22,650
so he's essentially doing like the
opposite of the crowd.

3128
02:23:22,650 --> 02:23:23,490
Janet Chamber,
right?

3129
02:23:23,491 --> 02:23:25,590
It says you can get what's called
hyperthermia.

3130
02:23:25,591 --> 02:23:30,591
If you do this in a bad way,
this heavy bathers in favor of the

3131
02:23:30,691 --> 02:23:35,130
hottest temperatures always wear felt
caps and slippers because the wooden

3132
02:23:35,131 --> 02:23:39,020
surfaces tend to get very high.
God,

3133
02:23:39,180 --> 02:23:42,690
that sounds adorable.
Felt the haves and slippery the going in

3134
02:23:42,691 --> 02:23:47,691
like Robin Hood,
Robin Hood Cook things at two 50 yeah,

3135
02:23:48,780 --> 02:23:49,620
all the time.
No.

3136
02:23:49,621 --> 02:23:51,900
Yeah.
A lot of times when you cook like a

3137
02:23:51,901 --> 02:23:54,450
potato Wa one 50 pull it out of the
oven.

3138
02:23:55,710 --> 02:23:59,640
I cook at elk steak.
I'll cook it at two 50 and I put an

3139
02:23:59,641 --> 02:24:02,790
internal thermometer and when it gets to
125 degrees and I pull it,

3140
02:24:02,820 --> 02:24:04,650
yeah,
Jack the temperature up and I see,

3141
02:24:04,651 --> 02:24:07,230
or the outside,
it's time to eat.

3142
02:24:07,231 --> 02:24:11,610
Three 20 it says one 60 Fahrenheit is
three 20 for short spells.

3143
02:24:12,130 --> 02:24:14,390
320 degrees.
Ooh,

3144
02:24:14,610 --> 02:24:15,870
so these people,
aren't they?

3145
02:24:15,870 --> 02:24:19,020
This is a whole nother psychosis.
This isn't bound inflammation.

3146
02:24:19,040 --> 02:24:23,910
This is not just what people do.
Always leave it,

3147
02:24:25,270 --> 02:24:27,780
just leave it.
You can't leave it alone.

3148
02:24:27,781 --> 02:24:30,750
We had a good thing going.
People that tattoo their eyeballs.

3149
02:24:30,990 --> 02:24:33,540
Yeah.
Why wasn't good enough to write.

3150
02:24:33,541 --> 02:24:36,760
You only live once and your forehead.
You have to Tatiana,

3151
02:24:36,761 --> 02:24:38,940
I balls black.
He couldn't stop.

3152
02:24:39,420 --> 02:24:42,380
You have to be like towed from x men.
Why do you have to do that?

3153
02:24:42,600 --> 02:24:44,130
Why are you putting things into your
eyeballs?

3154
02:24:44,140 --> 02:24:47,250
No one wants you to do that,
but people can't help it.

3155
02:24:47,310 --> 02:24:51,660
They can't leave things alone.
If they get one piercing in their face,

3156
02:24:51,690 --> 02:24:56,310
they want to get the cheek piercings and
knows purely this guy got his fucking

3157
02:24:56,311 --> 02:24:59,670
eyeballs turned blue like you remember
when you were a kid?

3158
02:24:59,730 --> 02:25:01,920
No one had their face tattooed.
Nobody.

3159
02:25:01,921 --> 02:25:04,410
No one.
And now look at this and another one.

3160
02:25:04,490 --> 02:25:07,200
Yeah,
full eyeball Tattoo Solace and says,

3161
02:25:07,230 --> 02:25:09,360
oh my God,
your soul is Bro.

3162
02:25:09,930 --> 02:25:10,920
Hey Bro,
your solo.

3163
02:25:10,921 --> 02:25:14,310
So you've got an umbrella like Mary
poppins and she stupid.

3164
02:25:14,311 --> 02:25:15,710
Fuck,
it's got an umbrella.

3165
02:25:16,530 --> 02:25:21,530
And what does that a microphone.
Is it a microphone or a razor blade?

3166
02:25:21,600 --> 02:25:23,740
What do you do when your kids start
asking have

3167
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:28,990
to do those on their face to anywhere
they say what they want to be peers.

3168
02:25:28,991 --> 02:25:29,720
Do they want to?

3169
02:25:29,720 --> 02:25:32,530
I th I,
I have two full sleeves.

3170
02:25:32,860 --> 02:25:35,590
Uh,
I would be a massive hypocrite if I told

3171
02:25:35,591 --> 02:25:37,780
them not to get tattoos,
but I would definitely tell them,

3172
02:25:38,500 --> 02:25:41,970
you really should think about the fact
that you're going to keep the skin for

3173
02:25:41,971 --> 02:25:43,310
your rest of your life.
Like,

3174
02:25:43,420 --> 02:25:44,500
don't,
you know,

3175
02:25:44,501 --> 02:25:46,960
if you want to get a tattoo,
it should mean something.

3176
02:25:47,320 --> 02:25:51,580
Don't get anything done that's cheap.
Go real artists.

3177
02:25:51,970 --> 02:25:53,470
Think about it.
Yeah.

3178
02:25:54,280 --> 02:25:55,750
You know?
Yeah.

3179
02:25:55,810 --> 02:25:57,190
He can't control them,
I guess.

3180
02:25:57,220 --> 02:25:58,930
No,
I don't think.

3181
02:25:58,931 --> 02:26:00,610
Not only do I think you can't control
them,

3182
02:26:00,611 --> 02:26:03,100
but I think if you try to control them,
you're going to do the opposite.

3183
02:26:03,130 --> 02:26:06,610
Nose piercing,
nose piercing seems easy.

3184
02:26:06,910 --> 02:26:09,760
He'd get it taken out.
You put it back in.

3185
02:26:10,180 --> 02:26:12,620
It's no big deal.
I would rather nose piercing that

3186
02:26:12,640 --> 02:26:16,240
forehead tattoo,
but they're so beautiful and feed a loca

3187
02:26:17,060 --> 02:26:18,690
rather than your forehead,
eh?

3188
02:26:20,210 --> 02:26:21,130
Yeah.
I think,

3189
02:26:21,131 --> 02:26:24,010
uh,
my younger one was like,

3190
02:26:24,100 --> 02:26:25,540
I like a little nose.
Like,

3191
02:26:25,720 --> 02:26:26,201
well,
no,

3192
02:26:26,201 --> 02:26:28,600
it's like the little.in the nose kind of
thing.

3193
02:26:28,601 --> 02:26:30,770
I was like,
I could be worse things in this life.

3194
02:26:31,210 --> 02:26:36,140
I doesn't really make me that angry,
but she's so perfect just like I get it.

3195
02:26:36,400 --> 02:26:37,650
Oh,
don't do that.

3196
02:26:37,750 --> 02:26:39,760
People like decorating themselves
though.

3197
02:26:39,850 --> 02:26:43,450
Then we were buying something.
This was when we were in New York and

3198
02:26:43,451 --> 02:26:47,230
we're just walking around and then I was
buying something in the woman at the

3199
02:26:47,231 --> 02:26:51,880
register was tons of piercings on her
nose and her ears and like,

3200
02:26:51,940 --> 02:26:54,820
you know,
like 50 on her ear.

3201
02:26:55,420 --> 02:26:56,253
And I said,
uh,

3202
02:26:56,950 --> 02:26:58,480
I said,
how did the nose one?

3203
02:26:58,540 --> 02:27:01,030
Did you nose piercing hurt?
This is right off our conversation.

3204
02:27:01,090 --> 02:27:03,490
Oh yes.
It really did hurt.

3205
02:27:03,491 --> 02:27:06,590
It was so painful and they had to do it
twice and then it got infected and it

3206
02:27:06,600 --> 02:27:07,660
was just a terrible thing.

3207
02:27:07,660 --> 02:27:09,580
I've got staff and gang grandy.
Yeah.

3208
02:27:09,780 --> 02:27:12,910
And this isn't even my nose anymore.
I'm looking at my daughter,

3209
02:27:12,911 --> 02:27:15,160
like say,
let's see what can happen.

3210
02:27:15,210 --> 02:27:16,540
It's just like,
I still want it.

3211
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:18,340
No,
you can't stop them.

3212
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:21,820
People like decorate and themselves and
I know it's a weird thing.

3213
02:27:21,880 --> 02:27:23,230
I have a bad one.
Not I have,

3214
02:27:23,530 --> 02:27:25,960
I have three.
I have a really bad one on my leg.

3215
02:27:26,050 --> 02:27:27,310
What is it?
It's,

3216
02:27:27,311 --> 02:27:29,930
I'm a wizard.
Is it?

3217
02:27:30,160 --> 02:27:31,030
Yeah.
You want to say it?

3218
02:27:31,520 --> 02:27:33,760
We'll show you.
This was my first tattoo.

3219
02:27:33,880 --> 02:27:36,170
It was a guy in New Jersey.
I just picked it up.

3220
02:27:36,190 --> 02:27:37,180
The wars.
He

3221
02:27:40,330 --> 02:27:43,440
was rough.
He said got a candy cane in his hand.

3222
02:27:43,520 --> 02:27:46,660
Well it the original one on the wall.
He was watering a pot plant.

3223
02:27:46,900 --> 02:27:47,733
Hold on,
let me get that.

3224
02:27:48,520 --> 02:27:50,830
He was watering a pot plant and I was
like,

3225
02:27:50,831 --> 02:27:52,510
I can't do that.
That's reckless.

3226
02:27:52,900 --> 02:27:55,720
Hold on a second.
You know what's really funny?

3227
02:27:55,900 --> 02:27:57,910
Pull the microphone down so I can see
your face here.

3228
02:27:58,440 --> 02:28:00,160
Alright,
here we go.

3229
02:28:00,400 --> 02:28:01,233
Look at everybody.

3230
02:28:05,740 --> 02:28:08,110
You know what's really funny?
Uh,

3231
02:28:08,650 --> 02:28:13,450
so when we did the show for your buddy
that helps the Congo pygmies,

3232
02:28:13,451 --> 02:28:14,290
Justin,
Justin,

3233
02:28:14,470 --> 02:28:18,190
Justin on the back of his book.
It's exactly my tattoo.

3234
02:28:18,240 --> 02:28:23,240
His him that him hat with his beard.
It all comes full circle.

3235
02:28:25,470 --> 02:28:27,410
I showed it to him that night when we
did the show.

3236
02:28:27,411 --> 02:28:28,680
He was pretty freaked out.
Yeah.

3237
02:28:29,120 --> 02:28:31,270
He just sent me a text saying he's going
to kill him.

3238
02:28:31,440 --> 02:28:34,370
He's going to climb Mount Kilimanjaro.
Oh my God.

3239
02:28:34,760 --> 02:28:36,350
Yeah.
I liked meeting that guy.

3240
02:28:36,351 --> 02:28:38,310
That was great.
That was the best part.

3241
02:28:38,330 --> 02:28:40,760
But he's,
the chest is even one of the nicest

3242
02:28:40,761 --> 02:28:41,900
guys.
Love that guy.

3243
02:28:42,170 --> 02:28:44,060
Love that guy.
But do things for him.

3244
02:28:44,090 --> 02:28:45,630
Oh my God.
He's just a,

3245
02:28:46,160 --> 02:28:50,090
just a gem of a human being.
I just wanted to hang with him all

3246
02:28:50,090 --> 02:28:52,040
night.
It was from this podcast.

3247
02:28:52,041 --> 02:28:55,940
We've built more than 20 different wells
in the Congo.

3248
02:28:56,240 --> 02:28:58,820
He's built,
they built hundreds of wells there now.

3249
02:28:58,850 --> 02:29:00,890
It's amazing just because of this
podcast alone,

3250
02:29:00,920 --> 02:29:03,140
more than 20 wells were build.
They're awesome.

3251
02:29:03,470 --> 02:29:05,690
Awesome.
He's such a good guy.

3252
02:29:05,720 --> 02:29:08,630
And just one of those people like
instantly you just kind of,

3253
02:29:08,690 --> 02:29:09,860
you could tell.
Yeah,

3254
02:29:09,920 --> 02:29:10,850
yeah.
He's a saint.

3255
02:29:10,970 --> 02:29:11,691
Yeah.
Like,

3256
02:29:11,691 --> 02:29:14,050
like legitimately like a saint.
Yeah.

3257
02:29:14,540 --> 02:29:19,540
His book is pretty great and he's a
fucking cage fighter and now how does

3258
02:29:20,271 --> 02:29:22,220
that,
yeah.

3259
02:29:22,520 --> 02:29:24,470
Yeah.
So that'd be a nice guy.

3260
02:29:24,650 --> 02:29:26,150
No,
he was really cool.

3261
02:29:26,180 --> 02:29:31,010
But I wish I had a picture of the book.
It literally is my shitty tattoo is,

3262
02:29:31,070 --> 02:29:32,540
is him.
How many other ones you got?

3263
02:29:33,260 --> 02:29:36,620
I've got two more cup.
Went up here and went up here.

3264
02:29:36,621 --> 02:29:37,880
Those are good.
This was,

3265
02:29:37,910 --> 02:29:40,310
and this was,
this was like a shitty spot.

3266
02:29:40,311 --> 02:29:43,070
Tore it too.
It was kind of like a coward way on your

3267
02:29:43,071 --> 02:29:43,670
calf.

3268
02:29:43,670 --> 02:29:45,920
It's just like there is that.
Yeah,

3269
02:29:47,450 --> 02:29:49,820
that's my tattoo.
He's holding the thing.

3270
02:29:50,090 --> 02:29:52,100
Yeah.
He's got a spear that he got from the

3271
02:29:52,101 --> 02:29:55,040
pygmies and he's wearing a hat they made
out of leaves.

3272
02:29:55,041 --> 02:29:58,970
Justin looks like my shitty tattoo.
What's on your raw shoulders?

3273
02:29:59,540 --> 02:30:02,930
Uh,
my wife's name is on here and uh,

3274
02:30:02,990 --> 02:30:07,460
over here is like the sun with this
quote from Walt Whitman on it.

3275
02:30:08,840 --> 02:30:12,650
These are the,
these are the days that must happen to

3276
02:30:12,651 --> 02:30:16,640
you from Ode to the song of the open
road by Walt Whitman.

3277
02:30:16,641 --> 02:30:19,940
These are the days that must happen.
These are the days that must happen to

3278
02:30:19,941 --> 02:30:22,370
you.
You shall not,

3279
02:30:22,790 --> 02:30:25,270
you shall not gather,
uh,

3280
02:30:25,340 --> 02:30:27,410
rich's,
you'll scatter with a lavish hand.

3281
02:30:27,411 --> 02:30:32,270
All that you earn and achieve.
You shall not settle in one place,

3282
02:30:32,271 --> 02:30:35,020
but we'll leave.
Uh,

3283
02:30:35,270 --> 02:30:40,270
but we'll leave to the silent leaders
and laughing at those.

3284
02:30:40,761 --> 02:30:41,780
You leave behind.

3285
02:30:42,560 --> 02:30:44,180
Um,
basically go out.

3286
02:30:44,540 --> 02:30:46,310
These are the days that must happen to
you.

3287
02:30:46,370 --> 02:30:47,450
Be Fearless.
Go,

3288
02:30:47,720 --> 02:30:48,570
go,
just go,

3289
02:30:48,590 --> 02:30:50,370
go be fearless.
Go stay in the harbor.

3290
02:30:50,450 --> 02:30:52,310
Don't stay in one place.
Don't stay in the harbor.

3291
02:30:52,320 --> 02:30:56,180
Go and keep touch with friends from back
home.

3292
02:30:56,690 --> 02:31:00,770
Yeah.
I've got a real tight group from a grade

3293
02:31:00,771 --> 02:31:01,610
school,
high school.

3294
02:31:01,700 --> 02:31:06,350
Did some of them not leave,
not go anywhere.

3295
02:31:06,380 --> 02:31:07,790
And you,
you were around them and you just,

3296
02:31:08,030 --> 02:31:10,610
you get to see what that's like.
Um,

3297
02:31:10,760 --> 02:31:11,630
a little bit.
Yeah.

3298
02:31:11,631 --> 02:31:13,370
It's a weird way of living.
Yeah.

3299
02:31:14,210 --> 02:31:18,130
It is a weird way of living and I get
nostalgic sometimes because I see,

3300
02:31:18,290 --> 02:31:20,100
I go back that same place,

3301
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:22,920
you know,
where I was a kid and uh,

3302
02:31:23,730 --> 02:31:25,890
and the one hand it seems like,
you know,

3303
02:31:25,891 --> 02:31:28,800
you could have made that choice.
You could stay and easy.

3304
02:31:28,890 --> 02:31:33,030
It's just stay there and be at the same
spot and do the same thing and there's

3305
02:31:33,031 --> 02:31:36,090
something very appealing and calm about
it.

3306
02:31:36,690 --> 02:31:39,360
But it wasn't my nature.
I couldn't do it.

3307
02:31:39,700 --> 02:31:41,890
Yeah.
There's always something appealing about

3308
02:31:41,891 --> 02:31:43,270
something that other people are doing
though,

3309
02:31:43,271 --> 02:31:44,021
isn't it?
Yeah,

3310
02:31:44,021 --> 02:31:47,620
for sure.
You think about your own situations and

3311
02:31:47,621 --> 02:31:49,480
the weirdness of your own existence and
you go,

3312
02:31:49,481 --> 02:31:51,400
ah,
I want to be great if I just fucking

3313
02:31:51,401 --> 02:31:52,380
cabinet maker and

3314
02:31:52,560 --> 02:31:54,300
Belgium.
Yeah,

3315
02:31:54,301 --> 02:31:57,540
exactly.
He has his coffee in the morning.

3316
02:31:57,541 --> 02:32:00,570
He just makes his cabinets,
goes to the same cafe every evening and

3317
02:32:00,590 --> 02:32:03,570
has a beer and he gets embedded nine and
his,

3318
02:32:03,571 --> 02:32:04,950
him and his dog.
Perfect.

3319
02:32:04,951 --> 02:32:07,110
Sitting at the bar.
I love his cabinets.

3320
02:32:07,140 --> 02:32:08,400
Yeah.
And he's like,

3321
02:32:08,430 --> 02:32:09,560
Oh,
this is hell.

3322
02:32:10,710 --> 02:32:14,850
I live show is kind of jokes.
It happened to me around the world since

3323
02:32:14,851 --> 02:32:17,610
I started baking this bread.
When I'm on the road,

3324
02:32:17,611 --> 02:32:20,400
I'll go see these bakers.
Like if there's someone really good in a

3325
02:32:20,401 --> 02:32:22,820
town that I'm in and just go talk to
him.

3326
02:32:22,821 --> 02:32:23,870
He's so big.
He's just like,

3327
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:24,840
like

3328
02:32:24,840 --> 02:32:27,290
if you were a martial artist,
she'd go train with them.

3329
02:32:27,291 --> 02:32:27,590
Yeah.

3330
02:32:27,590 --> 02:32:30,020
Yeah.
I go and I go and check out how they

3331
02:32:30,021 --> 02:32:32,300
make their bread and and see what
they're doing.

3332
02:32:33,440 --> 02:32:34,610
Hey,
I'm Tom Papa.

3333
02:32:34,840 --> 02:32:36,200
A little sour dough.
Yeah.

3334
02:32:36,201 --> 02:32:36,651
Like,
Hey,

3335
02:32:36,651 --> 02:32:37,720
you know,
I'll,

3336
02:32:37,740 --> 02:32:39,680
I'll tweet out.
Then I'm going to come.

3337
02:32:39,681 --> 02:32:42,170
And then they'll,
they'll bring me back and yeah,

3338
02:32:42,171 --> 02:32:43,470
it's great.
So what do,

3339
02:32:43,560 --> 02:32:46,790
did sign the good bakers in towns or a
website that you go to?

3340
02:32:46,791 --> 02:32:47,780
No,
you just like,

3341
02:32:47,781 --> 02:32:49,100
you know,
through instagram and stuff,

3342
02:32:49,101 --> 02:32:53,210
you start to see the ones that you
really like and who they follow and you

3343
02:32:53,211 --> 02:32:56,060
just start to see like who's doing the
same kind of a thing,

3344
02:32:56,061 --> 02:32:57,800
you know,
because it's a certain,

3345
02:32:57,860 --> 02:33:02,330
it's a very natural way of doing it.
So it's not like just like a big

3346
02:33:02,331 --> 02:33:03,950
commercial bakery that's just,
you know,

3347
02:33:03,951 --> 02:33:06,320
cranking stuff out.
Like there's people that are real

3348
02:33:06,321 --> 02:33:08,210
artists that are doing this stuff all
around the country,

3349
02:33:08,211 --> 02:33:09,044
all around the world.
Right.

3350
02:33:09,770 --> 02:33:12,890
So,
but it's funny because I'll come in and

3351
02:33:12,891 --> 02:33:15,740
be like all bright eyed and this is
amazing.

3352
02:33:15,950 --> 02:33:19,580
So you're a baker and you just come in
here and make this stuff and you,

3353
02:33:19,820 --> 02:33:21,890
I mean,
how great is it that you feed the

3354
02:33:21,891 --> 02:33:25,520
community and everyone really loves what
you do and you put your heart and soul

3355
02:33:25,521 --> 02:33:30,380
into it and they look at you like,
I'm up at two o'clock every day so I'm

3356
02:33:30,381 --> 02:33:32,170
in a living hell flower.

3357
02:33:35,220 --> 02:33:38,780
I can't stay up past eight you know what
I mean?

3358
02:33:38,810 --> 02:33:40,430
It is.
It's always like,

3359
02:33:40,520 --> 02:33:42,980
it's always the other thing with seems
to know what do you have to get up

3360
02:33:42,981 --> 02:33:43,814
early,
right?

3361
02:33:43,940 --> 02:33:44,661
Yeah,
man.

3362
02:33:44,661 --> 02:33:49,190
Because you know you walk in and want a
sticky bun on your way to work at seven

3363
02:33:49,191 --> 02:33:54,191
o'clock someone was up making that at
four so you can so it could be ready for

3364
02:33:54,471 --> 02:33:57,910
you at seven there's no way around that.
There's no way around that shit.

3365
02:33:58,010 --> 02:33:59,510
Yeah.
Yeah.

3366
02:33:59,540 --> 02:34:02,090
Those bagels,
someone's in there cranking than out in

3367
02:34:02,091 --> 02:34:02,924
the middle of the night.

3368
02:34:03,080 --> 02:34:04,490
There's a good bit,
there's a good,

3369
02:34:04,840 --> 02:34:07,700
a little bakery down the street from
here.

3370
02:34:07,701 --> 02:34:09,050
In fact,
I don't,

3371
02:34:09,590 --> 02:34:14,590
I don't like to eat sweets very often,
but they have these fucking chocolate

3372
02:34:15,891 --> 02:34:20,891
croissants that is so ridiculous.
The pastry part is so buttery and flaky

3373
02:34:23,951 --> 02:34:27,550
and then the chocolate part is so rich,
so good.

3374
02:34:27,580 --> 02:34:30,550
I can't even,
I can't get coffee there cause if I get

3375
02:34:30,551 --> 02:34:33,160
coffee there,
I will get one of those fucking things

3376
02:34:33,161 --> 02:34:36,520
and I'll feel like shit.
I know you'd tell it like it an hour

3377
02:34:36,521 --> 02:34:37,570
later you're just like,
what?

3378
02:34:39,370 --> 02:34:44,050
But while you're eating and it's heaven,
it's so rich chewiness to the,

3379
02:34:44,330 --> 02:34:48,280
there's a combination of the fleeky
buttery pastry in the,

3380
02:34:48,490 --> 02:34:52,390
the richness of the chocolate and the
sweetness and then you're drinking your

3381
02:34:52,391 --> 02:34:53,710
coffee at the same time.
You're like,

3382
02:34:54,070 --> 02:34:55,240
this is perfect.
I didn't,

3383
02:34:55,590 --> 02:34:56,770
I don't need anything but this.

3384
02:34:57,190 --> 02:34:59,350
Fuck diabetes and not worry about
diabetes.

3385
02:34:59,351 --> 02:35:01,280
I wonder about life.
I want to live.

3386
02:35:02,020 --> 02:35:03,490
Yeah,
that's living man.

3387
02:35:03,750 --> 02:35:05,490
It is the good stuff.
It's not,

3388
02:35:05,680 --> 02:35:07,150
it's not bad man.
It's just,

3389
02:35:07,180 --> 02:35:10,690
it's not good for you.
It's not anything in excess.

3390
02:35:10,691 --> 02:35:12,210
Right.
When I found the little treat once in a

3391
02:35:12,220 --> 02:35:16,180
while there's a company called no foods,
k,

3392
02:35:16,210 --> 02:35:17,050
n,
O,

3393
02:35:17,051 --> 02:35:19,630
w,
and they make waffles,

3394
02:35:19,660 --> 02:35:24,660
chocolate chip waffles,
and they make syrup with low glycemic

3395
02:35:25,980 --> 02:35:28,690
index,
very little sugar in the waffle

3396
02:35:28,700 --> 02:35:32,590
variation and it tastes good.
What do you mean they come like premade?

3397
02:35:32,620 --> 02:35:35,530
Like
put them in the toaster.

3398
02:35:35,531 --> 02:35:37,450
The lead.
They're frozen like an Eggo kind of a

3399
02:35:37,451 --> 02:35:37,961
thing.
Yeah,

3400
02:35:37,961 --> 02:35:40,660
but they don't last very long,
so you have to like eat them.

3401
02:35:40,780 --> 02:35:43,090
You have to thaw them out pretty
quickly.

3402
02:35:43,930 --> 02:35:46,390
Eight grams of fiber,
12 grams of protein,

3403
02:35:46,391 --> 02:35:48,320
four grams net carbs.
Whoa.

3404
02:35:48,321 --> 02:35:49,840
On sign for grants.

3405
02:35:49,840 --> 02:35:52,450
Right Bitch.
And I'm putting butter on those

3406
02:35:52,510 --> 02:35:55,710
motherfuckers.
And then they have their own syrup,

3407
02:35:55,720 --> 02:35:58,620
no syrup as very little as well.
Uh,

3408
02:35:58,730 --> 02:36:00,400
that looks perfect,
dude.

3409
02:36:00,430 --> 02:36:03,970
I'm telling you.
They are smart people that are healthy,

3410
02:36:03,971 --> 02:36:05,710
that figured out a way to make,
look at that.

3411
02:36:05,740 --> 02:36:08,080
Wow.
I had that yesterday.

3412
02:36:08,110 --> 02:36:09,700
Felt great,
worked out afterwards.

3413
02:36:09,840 --> 02:36:12,250
I feel like a fucking champ.
Didn't feel shitty at all.

3414
02:36:12,310 --> 02:36:12,791
Like,
look at that.

3415
02:36:12,791 --> 02:36:14,050
You felt like there's no way I can eat
that.

3416
02:36:14,170 --> 02:36:16,060
There's no way.
There's no way you got to get them

3417
02:36:16,061 --> 02:36:20,110
online or do you get them in a store?
I ordered them online.

3418
02:36:20,680 --> 02:36:22,630
Yeah.
And then they,

3419
02:36:22,631 --> 02:36:23,464
uh,
they're very nice.

3420
02:36:23,810 --> 02:36:26,260
They found out.
They come and they sent me a box of

3421
02:36:26,261 --> 02:36:28,120
shit.
What a treat and that we have some of

3422
02:36:28,121 --> 02:36:29,210
their cookies here too.
He tried.

3423
02:36:29,220 --> 02:36:30,700
We try one of their cookies before you
leave.

3424
02:36:30,760 --> 02:36:32,290
Tom.
Papa needs some of those.

3425
02:36:32,291 --> 02:36:32,750
Yeah,
man.

3426
02:36:32,750 --> 02:36:35,950
There's some stuff that you can eat that
people have figured out how to do.

3427
02:36:35,960 --> 02:36:38,020
Ozone stores,
places where they sound.

3428
02:36:38,080 --> 02:36:39,850
Oh Wow.
There's a bunch of places where people

3429
02:36:39,851 --> 02:36:43,420
have figured out how to make food that
tastes really good.

3430
02:36:43,421 --> 02:36:44,980
That doesn't fuck you up.
Yes,

3431
02:36:44,981 --> 02:36:46,230
of course.
Be Honest.

3432
02:36:46,380 --> 02:36:48,460
Let's be on the United States of
America.

3433
02:36:48,490 --> 02:36:49,600
Let's be honest.
Yes.

3434
02:36:49,690 --> 02:36:51,610
It doesn't taste as good as that
chocolate croissant.

3435
02:36:51,640 --> 02:36:52,510
Well,
no,

3436
02:36:52,600 --> 02:36:53,433
it just doesn't.
Well,

3437
02:36:53,450 --> 02:36:57,340
no damn good.
But you can have that damn go four times

3438
02:36:57,341 --> 02:36:58,690
a week probably.
Yeah.

3439
02:36:58,800 --> 02:37:01,750
You could have it every day,
but there's something about knowing that

3440
02:37:01,751 --> 02:37:04,350
you're eating shit and you're like,
I don't care.

3441
02:37:04,750 --> 02:37:08,110
Now this is part of it.
It's part of the part of the thrill.

3442
02:37:08,260 --> 02:37:11,290
Thrill and joy during the holidays.
Oh yeah.

3443
02:37:11,350 --> 02:37:14,950
When we had Christmas cookies on the
counter for like two straight weeks,

3444
02:37:14,960 --> 02:37:16,010
just walking through eating.

3445
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:18,170
I'm like chips.
Like I don't care.

3446
02:37:18,410 --> 02:37:21,140
It's Christmas cookie time.
That's heaven.

3447
02:37:21,200 --> 02:37:22,730
You know what I have the other night.
It's a good time.

3448
02:37:22,760 --> 02:37:27,760
Pumpkin Pie with cool whip Pumpkin Pie.
No one's even pretending cool webs good

3449
02:37:28,920 --> 02:37:33,920
for no.
No one even knows what the fuck.

3450
02:37:34,851 --> 02:37:37,100
Cool.
We're pretending it's a food.

3451
02:37:37,190 --> 02:37:42,070
It's just like some weird fucking thick
stuff that's white.

3452
02:37:42,440 --> 02:37:43,490
Yeah.
Oh,

3453
02:37:43,491 --> 02:37:45,770
that's good.
Where'd the Pumpkin Pie come from?

3454
02:37:46,250 --> 02:37:47,570
I don't even know.
I didn't even ask.

3455
02:37:47,571 --> 02:37:49,560
It was my mother in Law's house.
Oh Man.

3456
02:37:49,561 --> 02:37:51,740
I didn't ask a goddamn question.
That's wolf.

3457
02:37:51,741 --> 02:37:56,120
That fucker down.
Something about warm Pumpkin Pie too.

3458
02:37:56,180 --> 02:37:57,530
I'm like,
God,

3459
02:37:57,531 --> 02:37:59,120
it's so good.
Pumpkin pies.

3460
02:37:59,300 --> 02:38:02,780
So I fasted yesterday.
I didn't eat anything really.

3461
02:38:02,810 --> 02:38:03,800
The whole day.
Yeah,

3462
02:38:03,801 --> 02:38:05,570
I had a lot of Broccoli.
I had some water.

3463
02:38:05,580 --> 02:38:06,890
Coffee,
coffee.

3464
02:38:07,250 --> 02:38:10,640
Yeah.
I had probably four cups of coffee and

3465
02:38:10,641 --> 02:38:12,380
uh,
I didn't feel bad.

3466
02:38:12,381 --> 02:38:14,960
I didn't,
I felt pretty good when I woke up this

3467
02:38:14,960 --> 02:38:14,960
morning.

3468
02:38:14,960 --> 02:38:16,690
I was starving.
Yeah,

3469
02:38:16,820 --> 02:38:19,940
but once your body,
if you can figure out how to do it for

3470
02:38:19,941 --> 02:38:22,010
45 hours,
48 hours,

3471
02:38:22,280 --> 02:38:26,600
your body will kick into a state of
burning fat body of,

3472
02:38:26,610 --> 02:38:28,220
we will kick in.
No state of Ketosis.

3473
02:38:28,580 --> 02:38:30,410
48 hours straight.
Yes.

3474
02:38:30,800 --> 02:38:32,540
It depends on the person.
Some people,

3475
02:38:32,541 --> 02:38:35,180
it's quicker depending on if you're fat
adapted.

3476
02:38:35,181 --> 02:38:38,840
If it's even quicker than that,
but I know when I'm in that state

3477
02:38:38,841 --> 02:38:41,270
because my appetite kind of goes away.
Yeah.

3478
02:38:41,271 --> 02:38:42,104
That's what,
it was weird.

3479
02:38:42,290 --> 02:38:44,180
I was like,
why aren't I starving right now?

3480
02:38:44,240 --> 02:38:46,820
Yeah.
Well that's one good thing about when I

3481
02:38:46,821 --> 02:38:48,410
was sick.
Last few days.

3482
02:38:48,800 --> 02:38:51,450
I hardly at anything really sucks.
Succeed.

3483
02:38:51,451 --> 02:38:56,000
Also can look myself in the mirror.
I'm like snot coming down but looking

3484
02:38:56,030 --> 02:38:57,560
ripped me.
I'm gone.

3485
02:38:57,770 --> 02:39:00,080
My cheeks are sucked in.
My eyeballs are dark.

3486
02:39:02,770 --> 02:39:07,340
Uh,
there's something that girls,

3487
02:39:07,341 --> 02:39:11,030
do you guys ever do they do this post
where they look at you like this?

3488
02:39:11,150 --> 02:39:13,870
Yeah.
Photos I know have there,

3489
02:39:13,871 --> 02:39:17,390
but here's my ass,
my ass in my face.

3490
02:39:17,391 --> 02:39:19,490
When did that start happening?
At the same time,

3491
02:39:19,520 --> 02:39:22,640
there was no photos like that for the
fucking seventies and eighties people

3492
02:39:22,641 --> 02:39:23,474
just,
Oh you,

3493
02:39:23,630 --> 02:39:26,630
we weren't wasted.
They had to with no film.

3494
02:39:26,631 --> 02:39:28,580
They had chance to come up with that
children.

3495
02:39:29,810 --> 02:39:32,120
Fucking grown ass children look at my
ass.

3496
02:39:32,360 --> 02:39:34,670
Something about turning sideways.
I know.

3497
02:39:34,671 --> 02:39:36,380
It's so creepy.
Turning sideways,

3498
02:39:37,430 --> 02:39:38,840
looking over their shoulder like hold
on.

3499
02:39:38,960 --> 02:39:41,090
You know you're taking a picture,
right,

3500
02:39:41,150 --> 02:39:46,150
and you chose to stand some super
illogical way where your ass is facing

3501
02:39:47,301 --> 02:39:51,470
the camera and not your face.
Like you're looking over your shoulder.

3502
02:39:51,740 --> 02:39:55,790
This is how you chose to take a picture.
This is so crazy.

3503
02:39:55,820 --> 02:39:59,390
It is completely insane,
but it's super common.

3504
02:39:59,690 --> 02:40:00,411
Yeah,
no,

3505
02:40:00,411 --> 02:40:00,921
it's,
yeah,

3506
02:40:00,921 --> 02:40:02,540
it's kids do it.
Yeah.

3507
02:40:02,541 --> 02:40:03,830
Here he goes,
that this Gal.

3508
02:40:03,870 --> 02:40:05,390
Yeah,
that's common.

3509
02:40:05,540 --> 02:40:07,010
Yeah,
that's it.

3510
02:40:07,040 --> 02:40:09,560
Oh,
11 simple poses that will make you look

3511
02:40:09,561 --> 02:40:11,600
more attractive on the link.
Please.

3512
02:40:12,050 --> 02:40:13,380
I need to learn these.
Yeah.

3513
02:40:13,381 --> 02:40:15,380
I need that.
I want to look more attractive and I do.

3514
02:40:15,490 --> 02:40:20,490
We go turn your torso a or the body from
the waist instead of turning your neck.

3515
02:40:21,780 --> 02:40:24,120
I turned my neck.
I look at you like this.

3516
02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:25,110
I stand.
This is how I,

3517
02:40:26,670 --> 02:40:28,010
whoa.
I like that.

3518
02:40:28,070 --> 02:40:32,210
That's a stunning dunning.
I'd like to just turn my neck and I do

3519
02:40:32,430 --> 02:40:34,500
quick to like this.
I'm going to start some shit.

3520
02:40:34,560 --> 02:40:36,870
I'm definitely turning my tour.
Stand straight.

3521
02:40:37,370 --> 02:40:41,490
Some spacing.
Your posture by keeping your hand on

3522
02:40:41,491 --> 02:40:43,440
your waist.
How?

3523
02:40:43,460 --> 02:40:45,080
Yes cetera.
Oh,

3524
02:40:45,150 --> 02:40:47,250
how skinny she looks interesting.

3525
02:40:47,910 --> 02:40:49,380
I think the goods on the right looks
great.

3526
02:40:49,410 --> 02:40:51,000
That's a good one.
I find an issue with that.

3527
02:40:51,390 --> 02:40:54,840
Okay.
Fingers should be properly visible.

3528
02:40:54,990 --> 02:40:58,500
When you place your hands on the waist,
don't hide your hands.

3529
02:40:58,501 --> 02:41:02,400
Show your hand.
Does that make you look better?

3530
02:41:02,940 --> 02:41:05,190
No.
The girl on the left that just looks

3531
02:41:05,191 --> 02:41:06,570
fucking better.
Stupid.

3532
02:41:07,110 --> 02:41:10,150
The girl on the left is hot as the sun
doesn't make any sense.

3533
02:41:10,290 --> 02:41:15,000
Nobody gives a fuck if she even has
hands cross your legs or standing in a

3534
02:41:15,001 --> 02:41:19,440
way that will make them look angular and
creates space in the posture of the

3535
02:41:19,441 --> 02:41:21,280
lower body.
Uh Huh.

3536
02:41:22,240 --> 02:41:25,500
That girl needs a sandwich.
I'm not into those.

3537
02:41:25,560 --> 02:41:28,290
Lean towards the camera instead of away
from it.

3538
02:41:28,470 --> 02:41:29,191
Yeah.
That's what I do.

3539
02:41:29,191 --> 02:41:30,650
I lean towards the camera.
I'm like,

3540
02:41:30,660 --> 02:41:32,750
hello,
how are you taking like this?

3541
02:41:33,410 --> 02:41:36,600
Trying,
this is like the fucking rules.

3542
02:41:37,040 --> 02:41:37,930
Um,
a word.

3543
02:41:38,880 --> 02:41:42,090
Keep your arms away from your body when
your arm is properly visible in the

3544
02:41:42,091 --> 02:41:43,110
photo.
What?

3545
02:41:43,140 --> 02:41:45,360
Keep it not like this,
but like this.

3546
02:41:45,540 --> 02:41:47,220
Ah,
you don't want terrible website.

3547
02:41:49,080 --> 02:41:51,540
He said it's terrible.
I'm getting great advice.

3548
02:41:52,070 --> 02:41:54,930
You fuck off.
We're going to look amazing.

3549
02:41:55,530 --> 02:41:59,220
How about when you take selfies?
I can't get a good selfie for like life.

3550
02:41:59,221 --> 02:42:00,090
Depends on it.
Okay.

3551
02:42:00,130 --> 02:42:05,130
This tilt your head forward to look up a
bit to look sharp and slimmer.

3552
02:42:05,400 --> 02:42:07,020
That's true.
I want to look sharp,

3553
02:42:07,170 --> 02:42:08,430
dude.
How about sharp?

3554
02:42:08,520 --> 02:42:09,990
Ooh,
that's good to look sharp.

3555
02:42:10,050 --> 02:42:12,900
How about this?
Now just show me your at the same time

3556
02:42:12,901 --> 02:42:17,460
and you got something
like Yoga.

3557
02:42:19,410 --> 02:42:20,340
Yeah,
right.

3558
02:42:20,370 --> 02:42:25,350
Okay.
Don't slouch and sit but create angles.

3559
02:42:25,710 --> 02:42:26,980
You're sitting down.
Goals,

3560
02:42:27,010 --> 02:42:28,830
goals.
Let's look at that girl's back like how

3561
02:42:28,831 --> 02:42:31,810
is she even doing that?
It's all about just like the extra cyst

3562
02:42:32,830 --> 02:42:33,663
podcast.

3563
02:42:35,970 --> 02:42:38,250
I should have been doing this during the
podcast the whole time.

3564
02:42:38,970 --> 02:42:42,450
What's the next one?
Don't sprawl your legs while sitting on

3565
02:42:42,451 --> 02:42:44,820
the ground.
Oh,

3566
02:42:44,821 --> 02:42:47,220
see,
so she touches the knees together.

3567
02:42:47,280 --> 02:42:49,200
Don't sprawl.
Don't sprawl your legs.

3568
02:42:49,220 --> 02:42:50,080
Um,
listen honey,

3569
02:42:50,130 --> 02:42:52,320
don't mask whatever.
While we're trying to take a picture,

3570
02:42:52,321 --> 02:42:55,140
I'll go back to that.
We didn't say that girl is beautiful.

3571
02:42:55,141 --> 02:42:56,890
She can do whatever the fuck she wants
with her legs.

3572
02:42:56,970 --> 02:43:00,180
No one's going to complain.
She could have them legs like fully

3573
02:43:00,181 --> 02:43:01,840
spread wide and people like,
ah,

3574
02:43:01,860 --> 02:43:03,660
hey,
you want to get some coffee or

3575
02:43:03,661 --> 02:43:05,320
something?
And we want to do,

3576
02:43:05,580 --> 02:43:09,090
do you want to take over my company?
Lower your forehead a bit.

3577
02:43:09,750 --> 02:43:12,280
Well make up your mind.
Lean forward.

3578
02:43:12,550 --> 02:43:14,350
Hello.
Are you with our head for it then?

3579
02:43:14,351 --> 02:43:16,330
I'm not leaning forward anymore.
Oh right.

3580
02:43:16,331 --> 02:43:19,810
Hook up a little to make your eyes look
even bigger and more expressive.

3581
02:43:19,910 --> 02:43:21,370
Oh,
okay.

3582
02:43:21,371 --> 02:43:23,170
No,
that girl's hot as fuck.

3583
02:43:25,270 --> 02:43:27,200
That girl.
Look hot no matter what she did.

3584
02:43:27,201 --> 02:43:28,480
Yeah,
just be hotter.

3585
02:43:28,660 --> 02:43:29,590
Yeah,
be hotter.

3586
02:43:29,960 --> 02:43:32,440
Oh,
just put weight on the back leg while

3587
02:43:32,441 --> 02:43:36,940
posing and hence,
oh and hence creating an angular pose

3588
02:43:37,060 --> 02:43:40,120
and hence that,
that girls like,

3589
02:43:40,930 --> 02:43:44,080
but she looks like she's saying,
what the fuck did you ask me to do?

3590
02:43:44,800 --> 02:43:45,633
Okay.
What,

3591
02:43:45,770 --> 02:43:49,240
what did you that is not part of my job
description.

3592
02:43:49,690 --> 02:43:54,310
That is not what I was hired for and I'm
barefoot for fucking some strange

3593
02:43:54,311 --> 02:43:57,010
reason.
I'm barefoot and angry looking.

3594
02:43:57,011 --> 02:43:58,390
What did you say?
White man,

3595
02:43:59,410 --> 02:44:02,620
mother fucker.
I was reading a thing yesterday that had

3596
02:44:02,621 --> 02:44:05,590
sleep patterns of successful people.

3597
02:44:08,260 --> 02:44:11,200
Um,
Richard Branson,

3598
02:44:11,230 --> 02:44:12,910
Bill Gates,
people like that,

3599
02:44:12,970 --> 02:44:14,710
right?
Obama,

3600
02:44:15,250 --> 02:44:17,350
most of them six hours of sleep at
night?

3601
02:44:17,500 --> 02:44:21,100
Yeah,
most between like the 12 one o'clock to

3602
02:44:21,101 --> 02:44:22,900
like six,
seven o'clock in the morning.

3603
02:44:23,320 --> 02:44:27,370
I think there's a balance between
productivity and health and if you want

3604
02:44:27,371 --> 02:44:29,140
to get more done,
I would say that's probably the way to

3605
02:44:29,141 --> 02:44:30,580
go.
But I don't think those people were

3606
02:44:30,581 --> 02:44:35,230
pillars of health for fitness and
exercise is really hard and you know,

3607
02:44:35,231 --> 02:44:38,140
and really tax your body.
You need more.

3608
02:44:38,200 --> 02:44:39,970
I think you need eight.
You need eight.

3609
02:44:40,090 --> 02:44:41,620
I do eight.
You do eight?

3610
02:44:41,770 --> 02:44:45,520
I feel way better when I get eight.
He has six is six does not seem like a

3611
02:44:45,521 --> 02:44:48,340
lot cause this all the different people.
Nikola Tesla got to,

3612
02:44:48,610 --> 02:44:49,331
yeah,
but he's too busy.

3613
02:44:49,331 --> 02:44:51,430
Bang and pigeons.
He's crazy.

3614
02:44:51,820 --> 02:44:54,820
He was banging super,
super genius.

3615
02:44:54,880 --> 02:44:56,830
Who was in love with a pigeon?
What?

3616
02:44:56,950 --> 02:44:58,150
Yeah.
I never heard that.

3617
02:44:58,151 --> 02:45:01,240
He had a love affair with the pigeon.
Winston Churchill got like a hundred

3618
02:45:01,240 --> 02:45:03,430
hours of sleep at night.
Da Vinci and he was just drunk all the

3619
02:45:03,431 --> 02:45:04,780
time.
Are those,

3620
02:45:04,870 --> 02:45:07,480
are those dots mean hours?
It's when they slept,

3621
02:45:08,110 --> 02:45:10,360
he slept every four hours,
like a 20 minute nap.

3622
02:45:10,750 --> 02:45:13,390
Who did something similar to that then?
She did that.

3623
02:45:13,480 --> 02:45:15,190
Yeah.
That's what those little blue lines are

3624
02:45:15,191 --> 02:45:18,730
when they were sleeping.
That's crazy.

3625
02:45:18,760 --> 02:45:22,360
And Winston Churchill just slept like a
bear because he was drunk.

3626
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:28,300
He drank like crazy.
Richard Branson seems like he's getting,

3627
02:45:28,440 --> 02:45:31,210
let's say six.
Yeah,

3628
02:45:31,211 --> 02:45:33,430
12 to six that sounds kind of
reasonable.

3629
02:45:33,760 --> 02:45:37,360
That's reasonable.
But six is early to get up for me while

3630
02:45:37,361 --> 02:45:39,730
if he's one of those gets shit done.
Donald Trump,

3631
02:45:39,731 --> 02:45:42,610
three hours,
one to four,

3632
02:45:42,730 --> 02:45:45,420
one to four come on.
That's not real be true.

3633
02:45:45,460 --> 02:45:48,810
Is that real based on speed one,
you know,

3634
02:45:49,090 --> 02:45:51,420
that was the speculation about trump,
um,

3635
02:45:51,580 --> 02:45:55,000
from uh,
an article that was posted a while back

3636
02:45:55,001 --> 02:46:00,001
was that he had a prescription for
amphetamines and like the 90s,

3637
02:46:01,560 --> 02:46:04,530
and someone had prescribed him,
see what you could find that um,

3638
02:46:04,630 --> 02:46:09,630
trump prescribed speed for diet and he
stayed

3639
02:46:10,220 --> 02:46:12,140
on it for like eight years.
Really?

3640
02:46:12,470 --> 02:46:16,070
Yeah.
It's been my understanding when you talk

3641
02:46:16,071 --> 02:46:19,820
to people that love adderall and,
and those sorts of things,

3642
02:46:20,150 --> 02:46:24,110
that you become incredibly productive
when you're on that stuff.

3643
02:46:24,380 --> 02:46:27,860
And if you're one of those people that
gets used to being incredibly productive

3644
02:46:28,010 --> 02:46:32,270
and stuff like eliminating that,
it's very hard.

3645
02:46:32,710 --> 02:46:33,950
See,
1993,

3646
02:46:34,160 --> 02:46:36,620
Harry hunts unauthorized biography on
trump.

3647
02:46:36,740 --> 02:46:40,670
Last tycoon corroborated the rumors and
went one step further.

3648
02:46:40,671 --> 02:46:43,310
The Diet drugs with trump took in pill
form,

3649
02:46:43,550 --> 02:46:47,090
not only curbed his appetite,
but gave him a feeling of euphoria and

3650
02:46:47,120 --> 02:46:49,910
unlimited energy.
The Medical Literature,

3651
02:46:49,911 --> 02:46:51,860
Warren,
that some potentially dangerous side

3652
02:46:51,861 --> 02:46:53,780
effect could result from long term
usage.

3653
02:46:53,980 --> 02:46:55,790
They included anxiety,
insomnia,

3654
02:46:55,791 --> 02:46:57,530
and delusions of grand jury.
What?

3655
02:46:59,600 --> 02:47:01,910
According to several trump organization
insiders,

3656
02:47:02,180 --> 02:47:05,720
donald exhibited all these ominous
symptoms of Diet,

3657
02:47:05,721 --> 02:47:09,650
drug use,
and then some the supposed drug trump

3658
02:47:09,651 --> 02:47:14,651
took back then was tenuous.
Dos Pan a drug with speed like effects.

3659
02:47:15,621 --> 02:47:20,621
It's not unlike dexedrine.
These rumors say trump stopped seeing

3660
02:47:20,811 --> 02:47:24,380
doctor Greenberg decades ago,
but according to one source to our

3661
02:47:24,381 --> 02:47:27,890
source,
the Donald Trump of today is on a diet

3662
02:47:27,891 --> 02:47:32,891
drug called fen term mean and has been
since at least April of 2014 he does not

3663
02:47:37,251 --> 02:47:41,030
look like he's on a diet.
Phen phen phen phen phen to mean first

3664
02:47:41,031 --> 02:47:43,730
gain,
no tr notoriety us under the name phen

3665
02:47:43,731 --> 02:47:48,731
phen a miracle combination of
phentermine and fenfluramine another

3666
02:47:49,761 --> 02:47:53,270
established anti obesity drugs.
The only problem was that patients

3667
02:47:53,271 --> 02:47:56,570
taking the drug,
b camera b began reporting damage to

3668
02:47:56,571 --> 02:48:00,380
their hearts and lungs.
Apparently the combination destroyed

3669
02:48:00,381 --> 02:48:05,381
patients body's ability to regulate the
amount of Serotonin phentermine on its

3670
02:48:05,571 --> 02:48:05,900
own.

3671
02:48:05,900 --> 02:48:08,780
However,
it's still prescribed and while the US

3672
02:48:08,840 --> 02:48:13,840
National Library of medicine notes that
most people take phentermine for a month

3673
02:48:13,911 --> 02:48:16,670
or so at a time since the drug is
addictive,

3674
02:48:16,760 --> 02:48:20,750
trump has supposedly been taking
continuously for over two years.

3675
02:48:21,280 --> 02:48:25,880
Well listen,
when people get used to taking pills and

3676
02:48:26,060 --> 02:48:30,410
speed in particular,
they get used to that ramped up life.

3677
02:48:31,210 --> 02:48:32,930
They can't,
they can't.

3678
02:48:32,990 --> 02:48:35,450
It's very hard.
It's just very hard to just go cold

3679
02:48:35,451 --> 02:48:38,000
Turkey and be that guy who just dull
now.

3680
02:48:38,060 --> 02:48:38,990
Yeah.
Right.

3681
02:48:38,991 --> 02:48:41,720
Exactly.
From Superhero he had while he was on

3682
02:48:41,721 --> 02:48:45,260
the campaign trail,
like constantly speaking against and

3683
02:48:45,261 --> 02:48:47,510
could never shut the fuck up.
It was really impressive.

3684
02:48:47,990 --> 02:48:49,670
I mean it was nonstop.
Right?

3685
02:48:50,330 --> 02:48:53,150
72 year old man.
73 but it doesn't it make sense.

3686
02:48:53,210 --> 02:48:54,500
Yeah,
absolutely.

3687
02:48:54,530 --> 02:48:56,330
Yeah.
Hillary was fall.

3688
02:48:56,720 --> 02:48:58,940
Oh very nice.
I knew hillary was talking stuff too.

3689
02:48:59,270 --> 02:49:01,550
She was on a pro vigil.
What's that?

3690
02:49:01,660 --> 02:49:05,750
Pro Vigil is a drug that was first
invented.

3691
02:49:06,380 --> 02:49:08,160
They were trying to make a drug that was
actually

3692
02:49:08,160 --> 02:49:11,490
a performance enhancing drug and then
they had to come up with a reason for

3693
02:49:11,491 --> 02:49:13,650
taking it,
cause he can't just say,

3694
02:49:13,651 --> 02:49:15,600
hey,
we made a pharmaceutical drug that

3695
02:49:15,601 --> 02:49:16,890
enhances your,
uh,

3696
02:49:16,891 --> 02:49:18,120
your,
your energy levels.

3697
02:49:18,510 --> 02:49:21,720
So they came up with narcolepsy.
Oh yeah,

3698
02:49:21,750 --> 02:49:22,990
I've taken it.
Oh yeah.

3699
02:49:23,100 --> 02:49:24,990
Yeah.
It's great if you have to drive

3700
02:49:24,991 --> 02:49:27,270
somewhere and you're tired because it
doesn't give you,

3701
02:49:27,271 --> 02:49:29,970
it doesn't make you speedy.
And I don't think it makes you any

3702
02:49:29,971 --> 02:49:32,130
smarter or faster thinking or anything
like that.

3703
02:49:32,131 --> 02:49:35,610
But it definitely keeps you awake.
It gives you like a little elevated

3704
02:49:35,611 --> 02:49:37,460
sense of energy.
Yeah.

3705
02:49:37,500 --> 02:49:38,480
It doesn't sound so bad,
but yeah.

3706
02:49:38,481 --> 02:49:40,320
I mean you'd have to take something to
keep up those.

3707
02:49:40,321 --> 02:49:41,154
I mean,
you know,

3708
02:49:41,190 --> 02:49:44,550
just touring and stuff,
what that takes out of you and watch

3709
02:49:44,551 --> 02:49:47,130
the,
how they just were nonstop and he was

3710
02:49:47,220 --> 02:49:48,480
probably on diet pills.

3711
02:49:49,890 --> 02:49:52,190
Interesting.
And then get skinnier.

3712
02:49:52,500 --> 02:49:54,240
I knew a gal got on that phen phen
stuff.

3713
02:49:54,390 --> 02:49:55,110
Oh yeah,
yeah.

3714
02:49:55,110 --> 02:49:58,170
Back in the 90s she was beautiful,
but she was Chubby.

3715
02:49:58,380 --> 02:50:00,390
She just had a bad diet.
And you know,

3716
02:50:00,391 --> 02:50:05,391
just like the booze and she's probably
20 something or something right now.

3717
02:50:05,700 --> 02:50:09,300
And uh,
got on the fen phen and I hadn't seen

3718
02:50:09,301 --> 02:50:12,180
her in forever.
I haven't seen her in probably like a

3719
02:50:12,180 --> 02:50:13,800
year.
And then I ran into her and I was like,

3720
02:50:13,801 --> 02:50:16,200
Holy Shit.
Like what happened?

3721
02:50:16,201 --> 02:50:20,550
And you lost balls.
And she was like 120 pounds and slim and

3722
02:50:20,580 --> 02:50:21,600
gorgeous.
And I was like,

3723
02:50:21,601 --> 02:50:24,040
that is crazy.
So what did,

3724
02:50:24,120 --> 02:50:27,600
yeah,
but that it's our fucking weather and

3725
02:50:27,601 --> 02:50:29,900
like messing her body up and you know,
like,

3726
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:33,510
like heart palpitations and shit and
then,

3727
02:50:33,530 --> 02:50:35,340
you know,
a year later she was bigger than ever.

3728
02:50:35,610 --> 02:50:36,470
She's,
well,

3729
02:50:36,540 --> 02:50:38,640
I mean if you think about like taking an
Ibuprofen,

3730
02:50:38,641 --> 02:50:39,870
if like,
if that messes you up,

3731
02:50:40,290 --> 02:50:42,150
these drugs,
the impact is huge.

3732
02:50:42,180 --> 02:50:43,013
Oh yeah,
man.

3733
02:50:44,250 --> 02:50:46,740
Well I know so many people that are on
adderall.

3734
02:50:46,860 --> 02:50:47,551
Yeah,
I was just going to say,

3735
02:50:47,551 --> 02:50:49,890
have you ever tried to enter wrong?
Never meet me there to have it,

3736
02:50:49,891 --> 02:50:50,880
but I want to,
I know,

3737
02:50:50,881 --> 02:50:52,080
me too.
I want to try it.

3738
02:50:52,150 --> 02:50:53,370
Jamie's going to bring in something from
me.

3739
02:50:53,400 --> 02:50:57,330
You take it,
a dealer may or may not sell it to

3740
02:50:57,331 --> 02:51:01,050
children.
Know what God pill from a friend of mine

3741
02:51:01,051 --> 02:51:02,550
that I wanted,
I never even used it.

3742
02:51:02,610 --> 02:51:04,340
Oh.
And I still just have it.

3743
02:51:04,440 --> 02:51:07,140
Yeah.
Now all this stuff really works.

3744
02:51:07,300 --> 02:51:08,860
You ever,
you ever take a um,

3745
02:51:09,270 --> 02:51:10,590
ambien?
No,

3746
02:51:11,280 --> 02:51:12,840
I sleep easy.
I do too.

3747
02:51:12,841 --> 02:51:15,750
I got no problem sleep.
I was doing a show in the Middle East

3748
02:51:15,751 --> 02:51:19,290
one so my doctor gave me Ambien.
He's like,

3749
02:51:19,330 --> 02:51:22,410
if he need help with Justin your time.
I didn't ask for it.

3750
02:51:22,411 --> 02:51:27,000
He just gave it to me and uh,
I don't really take anything really,

3751
02:51:27,001 --> 02:51:28,740
but I took it.
It was,

3752
02:51:28,741 --> 02:51:31,770
I mean it just works.
You just like pretty awake and then you

3753
02:51:31,771 --> 02:51:34,860
just feel sleep just kind of coming over
you like,

3754
02:51:35,130 --> 02:51:37,000
like an ocean wave and it,

3755
02:51:38,420 --> 02:51:40,770
I mean do you feel when you woke up?
Not Good.

3756
02:51:40,800 --> 02:51:41,850
A little druggy.
Yeah.

3757
02:51:41,960 --> 02:51:42,710
Fucked up.
Yeah.

3758
02:51:42,710 --> 02:51:46,320
It wasn't like I woke up like,
oh I'm good to go be kind of tired and

3759
02:51:46,321 --> 02:51:48,300
then just go to the gym.
Yes,

3760
02:51:48,510 --> 02:51:50,850
exactly.
I'm just not into that drugged up

3761
02:51:50,940 --> 02:51:52,480
feeling now.
It's all cause they need,

3762
02:51:52,510 --> 02:51:55,920
then it becomes a whole cat and mouse
trying to adjust it.

3763
02:51:55,930 --> 02:51:58,950
And I had a buddy who was going,
I had a buddy who's going through a

3764
02:51:58,951 --> 02:52:02,310
divorce and couldn't sleep at all.
So he was taking two of those fucking

3765
02:52:02,311 --> 02:52:04,550
things at night and everybody was urging
them.

3766
02:52:04,551 --> 02:52:05,500
They were like,
man,

3767
02:52:05,501 --> 02:52:06,860
don't take that much.
Yeah,

3768
02:52:07,190 --> 02:52:09,340
I think this is,
this stuff is not good for you.

3769
02:52:09,490 --> 02:52:11,230
I'm always afraid you won't be able to.
Yeah.

3770
02:52:11,231 --> 02:52:12,880
You're not gonna be able to sleep
normally

3771
02:52:13,030 --> 02:52:14,870
or you don't wake up.
Yeah.

3772
02:52:14,980 --> 02:52:15,960
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

3773
02:52:16,270 --> 02:52:19,690
Take it and night-night choking middle
of the night and just

3774
02:52:23,770 --> 02:52:25,000
had cheese.
You're in the middle.

3775
02:52:25,001 --> 02:52:28,300
Some crazy dream about being in a
gunfight with the cops.

3776
02:52:30,040 --> 02:52:34,640
That's the thing about barrel ambien.
People do things and they're asleep.

3777
02:52:34,780 --> 02:52:37,120
Yeah.
Got Buy ice cream.

3778
02:52:37,980 --> 02:52:41,350
I had a bit about it in my act about a
friend of mine who made a Turkey.

3779
02:52:42,260 --> 02:52:45,160
He got up in the middle of the night,
preheated the oven,

3780
02:52:45,490 --> 02:52:47,500
went to the store,
bought a Turkey,

3781
02:52:47,560 --> 02:52:49,000
came home,
made stuffing,

3782
02:52:49,210 --> 02:52:51,940
mashed potatoes and gravy,
cooked it,

3783
02:52:52,240 --> 02:52:53,860
ate it,
went back to sleep.

3784
02:52:53,980 --> 02:52:55,600
Got Up in the morning and call the
police.

3785
02:52:56,500 --> 02:52:58,180
Someone broke into her house and made a
Turkey.

3786
02:52:58,580 --> 02:53:00,350
They're like,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

3787
02:53:00,351 --> 02:53:01,480
You fat piece of Shit.

3788
02:53:04,370 --> 02:53:07,050
They come to grips with your food
problem.

3789
02:53:08,270 --> 02:53:10,170
It's a real story.
It's a real story.

3790
02:53:10,550 --> 02:53:12,400
He didn't remember doing any of it.
No.

3791
02:53:12,420 --> 02:53:14,490
He made a Turkey.
Went to the store,

3792
02:53:14,670 --> 02:53:15,450
dude.
Yeah,

3793
02:53:15,450 --> 02:53:18,030
like bought a Turkey,
dealt with someone at the register,

3794
02:53:18,120 --> 02:53:20,760
bought a fucking Turkey,
drove his car.

3795
02:53:22,060 --> 02:53:23,940
Oh my God.
That's so crazy.

3796
02:53:23,970 --> 02:53:25,890
Yeah.
People are weird,

3797
02:53:25,891 --> 02:53:26,910
man.
I'm surprised.

3798
02:53:26,911 --> 02:53:28,860
No one's like killed someone.
All they have,

3799
02:53:28,920 --> 02:53:29,500
they have.

3800
02:53:29,500 --> 02:53:30,051
Yeah.
Yeah.

3801
02:53:30,051 --> 02:53:30,950
People have.
Yeah.

3802
02:53:30,980 --> 02:53:34,940
People have murdered people on it and
there was one guy that's Jesus.

3803
02:53:34,970 --> 02:53:38,510
He,
I want to say he killed someone in his

3804
02:53:38,511 --> 02:53:40,760
family with a crowbar.
Oh boy.

3805
02:53:40,761 --> 02:53:45,761
It was like some crazy story where he
was on Ambien and he drove to someone's

3806
02:53:45,891 --> 02:53:48,620
house and killed him with a crowbar and
then drove home.

3807
02:53:49,150 --> 02:53:51,620
We had no idea even did it.
Oh my God.

3808
02:53:52,250 --> 02:53:54,620
Well,
people react to different things in

3809
02:53:54,621 --> 02:53:57,620
different ways.
You can never predict exactly how

3810
02:53:57,621 --> 02:54:00,560
someone's going to react to like heavy
duty pharmaceutic.

3811
02:54:00,730 --> 02:54:02,140
That's what I was worried about.
I'm like,

3812
02:54:02,141 --> 02:54:05,950
I'm not taking this on the flight.
Who knows what I'm going to do?

3813
02:54:05,960 --> 02:54:10,960
Recount all of the fucking ocean.
How high up?

3814
02:54:11,041 --> 02:54:14,050
I just wake up in prison.
You don't know why

3815
02:54:15,680 --> 02:54:17,260
did I get here?
You know what you did?

3816
02:54:17,680 --> 02:54:22,150
Don't haven't watched the video of,
you kind of have some businessman

3817
02:54:22,800 --> 02:54:26,250
cat in the hat hat on,
beating someone to death with a nine

3818
02:54:26,251 --> 02:54:27,084
iron,

3819
02:54:29,590 --> 02:54:34,320
mixing the drink cart.
Go and try and get at the pilot.

3820
02:54:34,340 --> 02:54:36,150
Yeah.
Oh my God.

3821
02:54:36,860 --> 02:54:41,860
Does having the fly hood a nightmare and
hasn't been around that long,

3822
02:54:42,151 --> 02:54:43,950
right?
Like this is 2013 I suppose.

3823
02:54:43,951 --> 02:54:46,440
Just trying to look up.
There's something called the sleep

3824
02:54:46,500 --> 02:54:49,560
homicidal sleepwalking defense that's
been used

3825
02:54:50,920 --> 02:54:54,610
at least since 1987 she's like,
it goes back farther than that and

3826
02:54:54,611 --> 02:54:56,410
here's the wikipedia on it.
Wow.

3827
02:54:56,490 --> 02:54:59,710
Sleepwalking defense.
Wow.

3828
02:54:59,711 --> 02:55:04,711
Homicidal some,
some NAM bullism,

3829
02:55:04,880 --> 02:55:09,200
but on an or sleep walking sleepwalking
murderer.

3830
02:55:09,410 --> 02:55:12,260
The act of killing someone during an
episode of sleepwalking.

3831
02:55:12,770 --> 02:55:14,000
Oh Man.
See,

3832
02:55:14,001 --> 02:55:15,710
that's the thing.
Like if you're going to kill somebody,

3833
02:55:15,711 --> 02:55:20,480
wouldn't even be like even sleep.
But he was acquitted of killing the

3834
02:55:20,481 --> 02:55:23,740
murder of his mother in,
in 1987 after using the sleep,

3835
02:55:23,741 --> 02:55:26,270
walked in defense.
So let me just pause right there.

3836
02:55:26,450 --> 02:55:29,210
I would love to believe this man.
However,

3837
02:55:30,470 --> 02:55:33,500
I have a wonderful mother in law.
She's a lovely lady,

3838
02:55:33,680 --> 02:55:37,130
but I have friends whose mother-in-law's
or straight cons.

3839
02:55:38,770 --> 02:55:43,490
It's a real thing.
It's a real thing and it just so convey

3840
02:55:43,950 --> 02:55:46,460
at this guy,
he didn't kill his children.

3841
02:55:46,640 --> 02:55:48,830
You know,
he didn't know his wife drive to his

3842
02:55:48,831 --> 02:55:50,390
buddy's house and kills best friend.

3843
02:55:50,450 --> 02:55:54,080
What does it say there reportedly got up
from his bed,

3844
02:55:54,081 --> 02:55:58,670
still asleep and drove roughly 23
kilometers to his in laws house,

3845
02:55:58,671 --> 02:56:01,160
broken,
assaulted his father in law,

3846
02:56:01,161 --> 02:56:04,310
Denis would,
and stabbed his mother-in-law to death.

3847
02:56:04,370 --> 02:56:06,470
Wow.
Wow.

3848
02:56:06,920 --> 02:56:09,050
Good on you for all this.
He managed to drive himself to the

3849
02:56:09,051 --> 02:56:13,070
police station side from a few isolated
events and next thing he could recall

3850
02:56:13,071 --> 02:56:14,840
was being in the police station asking
for help,

3851
02:56:14,841 --> 02:56:16,910
saying,
I think I've killed some people.

3852
02:56:17,660 --> 02:56:19,040
My hands.
Whoa.

3853
02:56:19,940 --> 02:56:21,050
Wow.
Well,

3854
02:56:21,051 --> 02:56:22,760
that's what I would do too.
If was going to go,

3855
02:56:22,761 --> 02:56:27,340
pretend you've got to plan this out.
Something a blew up for you.

3856
02:56:28,250 --> 02:56:30,950
I don't know what it was crazy,
but you guys gotta help me.

3857
02:56:30,980 --> 02:56:32,420
Yeah.
Like if you know for sure you're going

3858
02:56:32,421 --> 02:56:34,280
to kill them.
Like there's no way I can not kill this

3859
02:56:34,281 --> 02:56:36,700
person.
I need a fucking rock solid excuse.

3860
02:56:36,740 --> 02:56:38,680
Yeah.
What does this non Bellambi Elysium

3861
02:56:40,320 --> 02:56:43,820
but I'm and,
and then he had a wonderful

3862
02:56:43,830 --> 02:56:47,090
thanksgiving.
So ever since that Oh man.

3863
02:56:47,150 --> 02:56:48,860
Stay married after that.
How's that work?

3864
02:56:48,950 --> 02:56:51,500
Yeah.
Probably maybe invite you probably

3865
02:56:51,501 --> 02:56:53,420
quietly is grateful.
Yeah.

3866
02:56:53,421 --> 02:56:55,260
The Dad pulls you aside and slips your
20s

3867
02:56:57,480 --> 02:56:58,740
than me.
Butter,

3868
02:57:04,850 --> 02:57:07,400
which some people do have weird
sleepwalking things though.

3869
02:57:07,401 --> 02:57:09,280
Sleep while I did as a kid.
Did you

3870
02:57:09,440 --> 02:57:12,950
[inaudible] like around kindergarten?
I would,

3871
02:57:12,951 --> 02:57:16,520
uh,
I would come out into like the living

3872
02:57:16,521 --> 02:57:18,140
room,
just screaming and crying.

3873
02:57:18,200 --> 02:57:19,033
Woe

3874
02:57:19,270 --> 02:57:20,920
and not have any recollection?

3875
02:57:20,960 --> 02:57:22,490
No,
none.

3876
02:57:23,510 --> 02:57:28,510
I did have recurring nightmares that I
remember the one very clear one was um,

3877
02:57:30,620 --> 02:57:32,120
it was a blackness,
you know,

3878
02:57:32,121 --> 02:57:35,660
sometimes when you're sleeping and then
you can feel the,

3879
02:57:35,720 --> 02:57:36,560
the black,
this,

3880
02:57:36,630 --> 02:57:40,620
the space was just very big and you felt
very small in it.

3881
02:57:41,310 --> 02:57:43,760
And uh,
there would be rumbling real mum,

3882
02:57:43,761 --> 02:57:44,220
mum,
mum,

3883
02:57:44,220 --> 02:57:44,751
mum,
mum,

3884
02:57:44,751 --> 02:57:45,261
mum,
mum,

3885
02:57:45,261 --> 02:57:45,721
mum,
mum,

3886
02:57:45,721 --> 02:57:46,231
mum,
mum,

3887
02:57:46,231 --> 02:57:48,140
mum.
And it would build on the momentum

3888
02:57:48,420 --> 02:57:50,750
recording,
bum,

3889
02:57:50,780 --> 02:57:51,261
bum,
bum,

3890
02:57:51,261 --> 02:57:51,741
bum,
bum,

3891
02:57:51,741 --> 02:57:52,574
bum,
bum bum.

3892
02:57:53,560 --> 02:57:57,820
And uh,
and I would feel kind of pulled back a

3893
02:57:57,821 --> 02:58:01,590
little bit and it got a silent okay.

3894
02:58:02,370 --> 02:58:07,320
And uh,
and then the terrorists have two tanks

3895
02:58:07,920 --> 02:58:12,210
would slowly come into the periphery on
the left and the right of a mum,

3896
02:58:12,211 --> 02:58:12,730
mum,
mum,

3897
02:58:12,730 --> 02:58:13,141
mum,
mum,

3898
02:58:13,141 --> 02:58:14,730
the,
and you see like the governor of the

3899
02:58:14,731 --> 02:58:19,731
tank and the tanks would slowly start
going towards each other from the left

3900
02:58:20,461 --> 02:58:24,840
and the right.
And then they would fall down this hole

3901
02:58:25,650 --> 02:58:30,090
and you'd get that feeling of falling.
And then sometimes I'd see the face of

3902
02:58:30,091 --> 02:58:30,190
it.

3903
02:58:30,190 --> 02:58:35,190
My father,
sometimes I have dreams of falling off

3904
02:58:35,651 --> 02:58:36,710
of things.
Yeah.

3905
02:58:36,790 --> 02:58:39,160
What's that supposed to mean?
That means that you're going to get

3906
02:58:39,161 --> 02:58:41,530
money.
Powerful.

3907
02:58:43,440 --> 02:58:48,440
Is that good?
Sometimes I do though.

3908
02:58:50,141 --> 02:58:52,870
Sometimes I have dreams where I'm like
catching myself like I'm on a tree.

3909
02:58:54,400 --> 02:58:56,140
This tree,
hang on.

3910
02:58:56,410 --> 02:58:58,000
Yeah.
What am I doing on the edge of this

3911
02:58:58,001 --> 02:58:59,920
building?
What am I doing on that cliff?

3912
02:59:00,350 --> 02:59:03,100
You get back to the same spot.
Get back to the same spot.

3913
02:59:03,180 --> 02:59:05,940
So I wouldn't connect the dream to the
sleep walking,

3914
02:59:05,941 --> 02:59:07,680
but what do you think it is?
I mean,

3915
02:59:07,681 --> 02:59:09,000
I don't know.
It could have been connected.

3916
02:59:09,180 --> 02:59:10,013
Dude,
you're a doctor.

3917
02:59:10,360 --> 02:59:13,140
Is that,
I remember one time I was at my friends

3918
02:59:13,141 --> 02:59:15,750
sleeping over my friend's house and the
next morning they were like,

3919
02:59:16,530 --> 02:59:21,180
Tommy can't sleep here anymore because I
did it at their house where they just

3920
02:59:21,181 --> 02:59:24,090
asleep and then you got some kids
screaming in the middle of screaming in

3921
02:59:24,091 --> 02:59:27,480
the middle of then crying and screaming
in the middle of the living room.

3922
02:59:27,540 --> 02:59:29,580
I've had kids do that at my house.
You have?

3923
02:59:29,700 --> 02:59:31,490
Yeah.
You pick them up being,

3924
02:59:31,500 --> 02:59:33,020
are you okay?
Yeah,

3925
02:59:33,030 --> 02:59:35,190
we'll let him to the bed.
You know?

3926
02:59:35,220 --> 02:59:38,730
It's the one kids too,
man.

3927
02:59:38,731 --> 02:59:41,970
It's so hard.
People don't have kids to understand

3928
02:59:41,971 --> 02:59:42,690
this.
But like,

3929
02:59:42,690 --> 02:59:44,250
yeah,
it's when I,

3930
02:59:44,251 --> 02:59:46,800
I'm sorry this before,
but when I was on planes before I would

3931
02:59:46,801 --> 02:59:51,000
be bummed out if a kid was crying was
fucking great.

3932
02:59:51,060 --> 02:59:54,060
There's a lot of fun fucking loud,
stupid kid.

3933
02:59:54,061 --> 02:59:55,370
Quiet your kid up.
Yup.

3934
02:59:55,680 --> 02:59:57,270
But now I'm like,
aww,

3935
02:59:57,300 --> 02:59:58,410
poor little kid.
Yeah.

3936
02:59:58,411 --> 03:00:00,750
Like it doesn't it that you don't even
hear it,

3937
03:00:00,751 --> 03:00:02,940
but it doesn't bother me.
No.

3938
03:00:03,010 --> 03:00:05,850
Like I'm upset,
I can't sleep.

3939
03:00:05,851 --> 03:00:07,950
It's like a little kid.
Yeah.

3940
03:00:07,951 --> 03:00:10,150
Once you hit so different,
once you have it

3941
03:00:10,190 --> 03:00:11,300
hopefully and the parents,
you,

3942
03:00:11,440 --> 03:00:12,071
you,
you,

3943
03:00:12,071 --> 03:00:13,530
uh,
I have empathy for the parents.

3944
03:00:13,531 --> 03:00:14,790
Like you're like,
oh,

3945
03:00:14,791 --> 03:00:18,390
I've been there when you're going
through that thing is just so rough and

3946
03:00:18,391 --> 03:00:20,120
it,
but it really is an instinct.

3947
03:00:20,121 --> 03:00:22,410
Like there is,
there is no,

3948
03:00:22,530 --> 03:00:23,960
like when you hear a baby crying and
plain,

3949
03:00:23,970 --> 03:00:25,560
there's not that thing.
When you had,

3950
03:00:25,561 --> 03:00:27,900
when you were younger,
this is just like get it Outta here.

3951
03:00:28,210 --> 03:00:29,980
Yeah.
That's a weird thing that people do

3952
03:00:29,981 --> 03:00:30,671
have.
Like,

3953
03:00:30,671 --> 03:00:35,560
I've seen it before were like young boys
in particular do not like babies.

3954
03:00:35,590 --> 03:00:37,300
No,
they don't like kids.

3955
03:00:37,330 --> 03:00:38,410
And they're around.
I'm like,

3956
03:00:38,440 --> 03:00:41,530
Oh yeah.
They'll roll their eyes and it's like to

3957
03:00:41,531 --> 03:00:42,940
them instinct.
Yeah.

3958
03:00:43,240 --> 03:00:45,490
And then once you have them,
you would just like,

3959
03:00:46,540 --> 03:00:49,150
but it's funny when you see like teenage
boys around them,

3960
03:00:49,480 --> 03:00:51,850
especially ones that haven't been raised
around kids.

3961
03:00:51,910 --> 03:00:53,870
Maybe it's the instinct that they're
going to have to,

3962
03:00:53,871 --> 03:00:55,600
uh,
one day take care of one of those.

3963
03:00:55,601 --> 03:00:56,434
Yeah.
Yeah.

3964
03:00:56,520 --> 03:00:58,090
And the party is going to end.
They're going to track,

3965
03:00:58,120 --> 03:00:59,980
be trapped.
The part is going

3966
03:00:59,980 --> 03:01:02,440
to end in a,
it's funny because like there are these

3967
03:01:02,441 --> 03:01:05,020
chapters,
it's like this is all coming full circle

3968
03:01:05,021 --> 03:01:08,680
to what we're talking about with like
Richard Branson on a boat,

3969
03:01:08,980 --> 03:01:10,480
getting his dick sucked,
doing coke.

3970
03:01:12,560 --> 03:01:14,110
But,
but here's the thing,

3971
03:01:15,580 --> 03:01:18,730
there's a cycle.
And if you hang in there long enough

3972
03:01:18,731 --> 03:01:21,700
becomes cool again.
Like if you're hammered and you're 20

3973
03:01:21,701 --> 03:01:22,660
and you're out there,
how it a party,

3974
03:01:22,661 --> 03:01:27,661
it's kind of silly and it's fun.
But if you're hammered and you're 60,

3975
03:01:27,671 --> 03:01:29,200
it's kind of sad.
Yeah.

3976
03:01:29,230 --> 03:01:31,360
But if you're hammered and your 90 it's
funny again.

3977
03:01:32,320 --> 03:01:33,340
Yeah,
absolutely.

3978
03:01:33,341 --> 03:01:34,270
It's kind of,
Hey,

3979
03:01:35,110 --> 03:01:39,670
you're a 90 year old drunk.
I goddamn about you all just suck my

3980
03:01:39,720 --> 03:01:41,890
Dick,
which by the way,

3981
03:01:42,070 --> 03:01:45,850
apparently the latest in the sexual
harassment Olympics,

3982
03:01:46,270 --> 03:01:50,200
the latest a entry is Stan Lee from
marvel comics.

3983
03:01:50,590 --> 03:01:51,460
Really?
Yeah.

3984
03:01:51,461 --> 03:01:53,110
He's 95 years old.
Yeah.

3985
03:01:53,770 --> 03:01:57,250
He lives in some giant mansion and he
has a bunch of nurses and he's trying to

3986
03:01:57,251 --> 03:01:58,120
get them all the blown.

3987
03:01:58,740 --> 03:02:02,380
Of course now he says it's a shake down.
He says they're all,

3988
03:02:02,410 --> 03:02:03,810
they're all just trying to get money
from him.

3989
03:02:03,840 --> 03:02:06,850
Uh,
may very well be the case.

3990
03:02:06,851 --> 03:02:11,851
She or it may well very well be the case
that he is like a lot of 95 year old

3991
03:02:12,971 --> 03:02:16,210
dudes with 20 million bucks in the bank
and about six months to live.

3992
03:02:16,211 --> 03:02:17,430
Just getting it on.
Lydia,

3993
03:02:17,530 --> 03:02:19,570
do you try?
You'd go for it.

3994
03:02:19,600 --> 03:02:23,080
He swing those fucking dice.
Come on.

3995
03:02:23,081 --> 03:02:27,910
Seven
Stanley,

3996
03:02:28,120 --> 03:02:30,130
if he really can,
if you know what I mean.

3997
03:02:30,400 --> 03:02:32,800
If you're worth what,
hold on,

3998
03:02:32,830 --> 03:02:34,270
go back to that.
What does it say now?

3999
03:02:34,770 --> 03:02:35,710
He,
okay.

4000
03:02:35,980 --> 03:02:39,220
He bought someone.
Then it was revealed that someone had

4001
03:02:39,221 --> 03:02:42,400
bought an $850,000 condo in his name
without his knowledge.

4002
03:02:42,430 --> 03:02:44,620
And that was last week.
I don't know if you're at oh no.

4003
03:02:44,621 --> 03:02:47,290
What happened?
Follow police report after discovering

4004
03:02:47,291 --> 03:02:49,720
that someone had stolen $300,000 from
him.

4005
03:02:49,840 --> 03:02:52,830
Well,
using a forged check and then it was a

4006
03:02:52,831 --> 03:02:57,831
reveal that someone bought an $850,000
condo in his name without his knowledge

4007
03:02:58,271 --> 03:03:00,790
of fact.
It came to light when his team did a

4008
03:03:00,791 --> 03:03:04,180
full audit of his accounts following the
forged check.

4009
03:03:04,600 --> 03:03:06,340
Whether this is any way related.
Okay.

4010
03:03:06,460 --> 03:03:11,460
So he might be being honest.
This might be in reaction to shake down

4011
03:03:13,310 --> 03:03:17,530
the shakedown,
but this guy has so much money that

4012
03:03:17,531 --> 03:03:22,531
someone bought an $850,000 condo in his
name and he didn't learn about it until

4013
03:03:23,051 --> 03:03:25,390
they were going over the books.
Well,

4014
03:03:25,630 --> 03:03:26,111
he didn't.
Yeah.

4015
03:03:26,111 --> 03:03:29,470
He didn't learn about it until they
found a $300,000 stolen cheque.

4016
03:03:29,500 --> 03:03:31,000
Yeah,
that's a baller.

4017
03:03:31,090 --> 03:03:33,040
Yeah.
Stanley,

4018
03:03:33,120 --> 03:03:37,810
you all went out of control.
Hero out that kicked fucking ass

4019
03:03:39,070 --> 03:03:40,920
superhero.
Yeah.

4020
03:03:40,960 --> 03:03:45,960
I'd like to think that he's not the guy
who's trying to tell these maids to suck

4021
03:03:46,091 --> 03:03:47,080
his dick.
Naw,

4022
03:03:47,081 --> 03:03:48,340
I doubt it.
I like to think that.

4023
03:03:48,370 --> 03:03:50,650
Me Too.
I want some heroes left.

4024
03:03:52,060 --> 03:03:56,260
A couple of those guys,
but hang in there guys.

4025
03:03:57,200 --> 03:03:58,033
One more time.

4026
03:04:01,940 --> 03:04:03,620
Let's wrap this bitch up.
What's bringing home?

4027
03:04:04,370 --> 03:04:06,880
Tell these people where you're going to
be performing your wonderful standup

4028
03:04:06,890 --> 03:04:09,080
comedy.
I'm heading out on tour.

4029
03:04:09,081 --> 03:04:10,280
Joe,
where are you going,

4030
03:04:10,281 --> 03:04:11,300
Tom?
I'm going to Raleigh,

4031
03:04:11,301 --> 03:04:12,500
North Carolina.
Oh,

4032
03:04:12,501 --> 03:04:13,700
you're going to Charlie?
Good Nights.

4033
03:04:13,730 --> 03:04:15,250
No,
I'm playing a theater.

4034
03:04:15,350 --> 03:04:19,820
Oh,
someone's Hashtag Boleyn Duke something

4035
03:04:19,821 --> 03:04:24,821
energy center or something.
The Duke fucking Energy Center and then

4036
03:04:24,831 --> 03:04:27,980
I'm going to Va Hill,
California.

4037
03:04:28,040 --> 03:04:30,890
Where's that?
I'm going to,

4038
03:04:32,510 --> 03:04:34,070
I'm all over the place.
Where's Va Ho?

4039
03:04:34,400 --> 03:04:35,570
I don't know.
North of here.

4040
03:04:35,630 --> 03:04:38,050
Everything's north of here.
They'll tell you how to go.

4041
03:04:38,350 --> 03:04:39,051
Yes.
Yeah.

4042
03:04:39,051 --> 03:04:41,190
GPS It book.
Just go to Tom,

4043
03:04:41,191 --> 03:04:42,580

4044
03:04:44,880 --> 03:04:49,880
Hello?
Okay,

4045
03:04:52,030 --> 03:04:53,440
Tom,
it's always a pleasure,

4046
03:04:53,441 --> 03:04:54,071
sir.
You too,

4047
03:04:54,071 --> 03:04:55,820
buddy.
Already seeing wonderful guests.

4048
03:04:55,821 --> 03:04:57,430
I always enjoy this very much.
Me Too.

4049
03:04:57,431 --> 03:04:59,320
I'm going to come back.
I'll bring some fresh underpants.

4050
03:04:59,321 --> 03:05:00,154
So dawn,
the sun,

4051
03:05:00,340 --> 03:05:03,490
we'll be back tomorrow with journalists,
Dan Harris,

4052
03:05:03,520 --> 03:05:07,390
and he's going to get in the tank first.
He's got a meditation APP and I guess a

4053
03:05:07,391 --> 03:05:08,790
book,
maybe just an APP night.

4054
03:05:08,800 --> 03:05:09,820
He's wacky.
Kids today.

4055
03:05:09,821 --> 03:05:11,930
Don't even read anymore.
All right,

4056
03:05:12,160 --> 03:05:13,600
we'll be back.
Bye Bye.

4057
03:05:15,580 --> 03:05:17,570
Perfect.
Just as I have to be perfect.
