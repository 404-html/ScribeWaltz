1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,460
Two one.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,870
And we're live ladies and Gentlemen,

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:10,350
uh,

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,900
or gentlemen to the ladies
and gentlemen listening.

5
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:13,734
But Youtube,

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,620
unless you have some non-binary
handle that you enjoy,

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,970
it's a new world.

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,053
Uh,

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,003
please,

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,270
please introduce yourself.

11
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:21,991
Sure.

12
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:22,291
So,

13
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:22,501
uh,

14
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:25,110
I'm Dr Mychart originally
from Saint John's,

15
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:25,944
Newfoundland.

16
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:26,370
Uh,

17
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,630
now I'm residing in London,

18
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:28,140
Ontario,

19
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,680
and I'm a family doctor and I've been
practicing cannabis medicine for just over

20
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:32,514
five years.

21
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,383
And

22
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:34,900
My name is al experience.

23
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,970
And I used to be in New
York Times reporter.

24
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:37,360
Uh,

25
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,860
then I became a spy novelist.

26
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:40,600
And most recently I wrote the book,

27
00:00:40,601 --> 00:00:42,700
Tell Your children the
truth about marijuana,

28
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:44,110
mental illness and violence,

29
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,480
which came out last month and,

30
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:46,750
uh,

31
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,810
has not endeared me to the
cannabis advocacy community.

32
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:50,390
I'd say

33
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,530
have they,

34
00:00:51,531 --> 00:00:51,891
uh,

35
00:00:51,891 --> 00:00:54,080
attacked you mercilessly for this book?

36
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,083
Yes.

37
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,480
And that's okay.

38
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,200
Um,

39
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,033
uh,

40
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,140
I've also heard from a lot of parents,

41
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:00,330
uh,

42
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:00,621
you know,

43
00:01:00,621 --> 00:01:01,191
some users,

44
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:02,630
but parents who've told me,

45
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,530
uh,

46
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,840
that the book really encapsulates their,

47
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,330
their family's problems in
the last couple of years.

48
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,330
Um,

49
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,370
I suspect my,

50
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,760
my real thoughts here before we even
get started is that we're going to find

51
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:16,440
that the truth is somewhere
in the middle here.

52
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:17,460
Um,

53
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,000
I don't think marijuana
is a hundred percent safe,

54
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,130
honestly for everybody.

55
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,293
I really don't,

56
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,220
I know too many people that have had
experiences where they took too much,

57
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,620
particularly edibles and,

58
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:32,070
uh,

59
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:32,490
I don't,

60
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,430
I want to say I know anybody
who had psychotic breaks,

61
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,340
but I know some people
that freaked out for weeks,

62
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,061
you know,

63
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:39,571
in fact,

64
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:39,871
a,

65
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:40,830
we just had a,

66
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,191
a,

67
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:43,200
a comedian here from Brazil.

68
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:43,921
Um,

69
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:44,940
a couple of days ago,

70
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:48,720
Rafi Bosstones who said he took
a couple of hits of a vape pen,

71
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:50,100
he was high for 14 days,

72
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,370
went to a psychiatrist and he's a big guy.

73
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:54,570
He's like six foot five,

74
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:54,901
six,

75
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:55,734
six,

76
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,191
you know,

77
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:56,731
and you know,

78
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:58,830
they told them to keep
taking it cause you know,

79
00:01:58,831 --> 00:01:59,400
he's like,

80
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,121
you're so big,

81
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:01,020
just keep smoking.

82
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:01,941
And so he,

83
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:02,610
he doesn't smoke.

84
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,900
He just kept hitting this vape pen.

85
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,730
He said I was high for fucking two weeks.

86
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,870
Yes,

87
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,950
you need to do it properly.

88
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:08,170
Right?

89
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:08,320
Yeah.

90
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,620
He's held to the same standard
as any other medicines.

91
00:02:11,621 --> 00:02:16,621
So you need to identify that there's
risks and there's benefits to it and some

92
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:17,820
people are definitely,

93
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,340
you know,

94
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,880
going to be more
susceptible to those risks.

95
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,900
And we need to kind of tease out those
people and make sure that those people,

96
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,380
you know,

97
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,480
don't put themselves at risk.

98
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:27,841
Yeah,

99
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:29,370
I think so as well.

100
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:31,890
And this is one of the reasons why I want
to state this because I'm a well known

101
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:33,120
marijuana advocate,

102
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,163
but I,

103
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,280
I do believe,

104
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:38,190
I believe absolutely there
are great benefits to it.

105
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,770
I think there's great
benefits in terms of uh,

106
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,690
relieving pressure,

107
00:02:42,691 --> 00:02:45,480
ocular pressure for
people that have glaucoma,

108
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,730
people with aids who are on medication,

109
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:51,300
people with cancer that are going through
chemotherapy find great benefit in

110
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:52,230
terms of helping them.

111
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,050
And then there's also
some people with autism.

112
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:58,710
I know people that their children have
autism and they give them small amounts

113
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,200
of edible marijuana and stops

114
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,033
seizures.

115
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,530
It's incredibly beneficial in the form
of CBD for a lot of different ailments.

116
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,720
But I think with all things,

117
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:12,310
and this is a stance that I've kind of
like really come to accept over the last

118
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,560
few years with all things
that affect the mind,

119
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,050
they affect everyone slightly differently.

120
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,273
Absolutely.

121
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,730
Yeah.

122
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,690
I'll see you wanted to say something.

123
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:20,310
They're not.

124
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,143
First of I,

125
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,120
I suspect,

126
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:22,301
you know,

127
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:22,991
there were people who said,

128
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:23,890
don't go on with Joe.

129
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:24,521
He's just going to,

130
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:24,911
you know,

131
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:26,680
he's going to try to eat you alive and,

132
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,120
and especially there'll be,

133
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:28,960
it'll be two on one.

134
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,490
I told them the truth.

135
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,210
First of all,

136
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,043
I,

137
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,250
I'll go on with anybody and I am glad
you had me on or you're having me on

138
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:36,731
because,

139
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:37,540
uh,

140
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,373
you know,

141
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,873
Bill Maher,

142
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,743
he won't have me on.

143
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,670
He's afraid to talk to me about this.

144
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,533
Why,

145
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,800
what did he say?

146
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,250
Well,

147
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:45,551
he,

148
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:45,731
you know,

149
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:48,640
he told the or his people told
the Simon and Schuster PR people,

150
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,180
uh,

151
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,440
we just don't want to have him on.

152
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,220
And a and NPR had a national NPR show,

153
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:56,170
had an interview scheduled with me,

154
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:57,100
an hour long segment,

155
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:57,881
and they canceled it.

156
00:03:57,881 --> 00:03:58,570
They said,

157
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:58,811
they said,

158
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:00,550
we don't believe in the
conclusions of the book.

159
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:00,941
Okay.

160
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,470
You don't believe in the
conclusions of the book,

161
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,660
have me on ask me anything.

162
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,040
And that's why I'm so happy that
you're not afraid to have me on that.

163
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,820
We can have a conversation that we can
have a conversation come at me with any

164
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:14,230
question you want about the science.

165
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:14,890
Um,

166
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:15,100
I mean,

167
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,270
I'll say right off the top,

168
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,830
I don't think marijuana's medicine,

169
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,371
uh,

170
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:19,570
it has a few,

171
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,380
uh,

172
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,450
medical uses that have been,

173
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:22,631
you know,

174
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:25,090
CBD has been shown to
reduce seizures in kids.

175
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:25,924
That's great.

176
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,100
A THC has been shown to reduce the
nausea associated with chemotherapy.

177
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:32,284
That's nice.

178
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:32,921
Uh,

179
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:34,090
but for the most part,

180
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,080
people use THC and cannabis
has recreational and toxicants.

181
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:40,690
They used them to get high the same way
they use alcohol the same way they use

182
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:41,524
other drugs.

183
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,730
And the sooner we,

184
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,290
we accept that reality,

185
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,820
the better off we'll all be.

186
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:50,500
That this is a drug and it has risks and
benefits and the risks and benefits are

187
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:51,370
different than alcohol.

188
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,540
They're different than other drugs.

189
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,870
But I don't think if you look sort
of on a population level basis,

190
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:56,800
they're less than alcohol.

191
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:58,270
I don't think you can even say that.

192
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,200
I don't,

193
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,400
I really strongly disagree with that.

194
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:01,960
I mean,

195
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,640
you just have to look at the death rate,

196
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,270
right?

197
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:04,661
Uh,

198
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:05,050
you know,

199
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,320
more people die from alcohol then,

200
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:07,960
you know,

201
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,550
almost all drugs combined.

202
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,440
But when we're looking at cannabis,

203
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,430
there's zero deaths attributed
to the use of cannabis itself.

204
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:15,881
Sure.

205
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:16,631
You could say,

206
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:16,931
you know,

207
00:05:16,931 --> 00:05:20,680
someone could use cannabis and jump
off a cliff or something like that,

208
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,780
but we're talking about the lethal dose.

209
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,700
You cannot die from cannabis.

210
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:27,070
And just based upon that alone,

211
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,330
it makes it much,

212
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:29,860
much safer than alcohol.

213
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,100
So could you say that if that is the case?

214
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:33,370
So,

215
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:33,611
okay,

216
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:35,050
so that's a really good question.

217
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,590
Uh,

218
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:40,030
the normal number that's used for us
desks from alcohols about 90,000 now,

219
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:44,440
about 30 to 40,000 of those deaths
are desk from the physical effects of

220
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:44,831
alcohol,

221
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,041
right?

222
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:45,401
Essentially,

223
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:46,180
liver damage,

224
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,920
either chronic liver damage,

225
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:48,701
you get cirrhosis,

226
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:49,534
you die.

227
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,590
In some cases,

228
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:52,840
you can drink so much that
you kill yourself in a night.

229
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,471
Uh,

230
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:55,540
so that's about 30 to 40,000 deaths.

231
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,030
The other deaths are generally
associated with alcohol,

232
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:02,720
meaning somebody drank exactly violence,

233
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:03,554
suicide,

234
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,990
car accidents and the,

235
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:10,820
all those numbers are basically based
on studies from the 90s and before where

236
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,301
you know,

237
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:14,420
people looked at traffic accidents
and there were certain number of those

238
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:17,900
accidents where people had a blood
alcohol content of higher than 0.1.

239
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,411
They said,

240
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:18,681
okay,

241
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:20,360
that's an alcohol associated death.

242
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,790
That's a fine way to count.

243
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,640
As far as I'm concerned,

244
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,910
nobody has ever done
that count for cannabis.

245
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,950
And I can tell you based on the,

246
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,280
on the tox screens that I've
seen from Colorado where people,

247
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:31,970
uh,

248
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,460
had cannabis in their blood
and committed suicide,

249
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,660
people have cannabis in,

250
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,630
there are I should say THC
and their blood and uh,

251
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,510
and got into a fatal confrontations
with police officers.

252
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,260
If,

253
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:42,710
if,

254
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,981
if,

255
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:44,540
and when we do this number for cannabis,

256
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,760
which we need to do as soon as possible,

257
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,860
the number's going to be
a lot higher than zero.

258
00:06:48,861 --> 00:06:51,170
I suspect it will be in
the 10 to 20,000 range.

259
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:52,820
We won't know till we actually do it.

260
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,061
Okay.

261
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:53,211
Well,

262
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:53,541
let's,

263
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,470
let's eliminate,

264
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,280
let's go even over the alcohol.

265
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,840
Let's eliminate all things like
violence and let's eliminate suicide.

266
00:07:00,841 --> 00:07:03,240
And let's assume those people would
have committed violence and committed

267
00:07:03,241 --> 00:07:03,661
suicide.

268
00:07:03,661 --> 00:07:04,494
Without it.

269
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:08,580
You're still looking at a giant number
of people who drink themselves to death.

270
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,150
Thousands and thousands and thousands
of people every year versus zero with

271
00:07:12,151 --> 00:07:12,960
marijuana.

272
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,771
And you're aware,

273
00:07:13,771 --> 00:07:16,290
I'm sure that correlation
does not equal causation.

274
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,040
And that,

275
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,760
especially in a place like Colorado
where you're dealing with cannabis,

276
00:07:20,761 --> 00:07:22,830
something that stays
in the system for many,

277
00:07:22,831 --> 00:07:23,664
many weeks.

278
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:28,350
If you're testing people and they test
positive for marijuana and they wind up

279
00:07:28,351 --> 00:07:31,470
committing suicide or they
wind up committing violence,

280
00:07:31,471 --> 00:07:34,860
they don't even necessarily have to
have been under the influence of it.

281
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,280
Well,

282
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:35,791
as you know,

283
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:36,624
there's,

284
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,860
when you test the blood,

285
00:07:37,861 --> 00:07:41,830
you can test the both the
active metabolite and the
inactive metabolite THC.

286
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,310
So,

287
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,101
so the test,

288
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:44,790
when you do a blood
test on somebody who's,

289
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,061
you know,

290
00:07:45,061 --> 00:07:45,781
has committed suicide,

291
00:07:45,781 --> 00:07:47,910
it's sophisticated
enough to tease that out.

292
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,600
So there's a lot of people who have
the active metabolite in their blood.

293
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,260
Um,

294
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,100
I agree.

295
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,721
Alcoholics,

296
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:55,230
they physically toxic substance.

297
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,810
Cannabis is a neurotoxin
for a lot of people.

298
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,040
But in addition to,

299
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,430
you know,

300
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,030
the death,

301
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,660
there's also just the morbidity
that's associated with alcohol.

302
00:08:03,661 --> 00:08:05,250
I mean it ruins people's lives.

303
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,360
That ruins marriages.

304
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:06,870
Uh,

305
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,950
it leads to weight gain.

306
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,020
It leads to a lot of
metabolic disturbances

307
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,470
for some people with marijuana too.

308
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:13,730
I think you could say some people,

309
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:15,350
especially weight gain at,

310
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:18,500
some people smoke a lot of pot and they
get lazy and they started eating Cheetos

311
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:18,981
all day.

312
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:19,550
And,

313
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,340
and you could also say
that with some people,

314
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:22,881
you know,

315
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:24,770
the waken bakers that you know,

316
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:26,420
seem to be wasting their lives away.

317
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:30,110
And that's like the
stereotypical negative con.

318
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,490
You know,

319
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:30,731
when you,

320
00:08:30,731 --> 00:08:32,960
when you're talking about a negative
description of a marijuana user,

321
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:35,090
it's the waking Baker at the
person who is high all the time.

322
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,240
You could absolutely said that
could really ruin relationships.

323
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:40,100
You could absolutely say
that it would ruin your job.

324
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,471
You could.

325
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,071
But again,

326
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:42,520
too,

327
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:42,791
you know,

328
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:47,620
we're using the term marijuana and
really we should be using THC or high THC

329
00:08:47,621 --> 00:08:47,851
when we're,

330
00:08:47,851 --> 00:08:48,600
when we're saying that.

331
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:48,880
Okay.

332
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,810
Because you know,

333
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:54,090
people who use a high CBD every day as
we know are most people listen to this

334
00:08:54,091 --> 00:08:56,310
part of the CBD is non psychoactive,

335
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,070
does not get you high super benefits.

336
00:08:58,071 --> 00:08:58,410
You know,

337
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,600
that can be extremely beneficial for,

338
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:00,911
you know,

339
00:09:00,911 --> 00:09:02,670
a variety of different
disorders that people have.

340
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,360
So,

341
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:03,510
you know,

342
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:08,400
we really need to be careful about using
cannabis versus using THC because the

343
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:09,360
THC that can do that.

344
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:10,200
And to your point,

345
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:10,860
you know,

346
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,461
but you know,

347
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:14,370
you say like THC can cause the
munchies and of course that's,

348
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:14,760
you know,

349
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,900
not good for someone who doesn't
want to gain weight and just,

350
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:19,171
you know,

351
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:20,420
so people know the,

352
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,450
the way that it does do that is when she
see attached it to the CB one receptor.

353
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,720
You had an increase in a hormone
called Ghrelin and Ghrelin,

354
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,140
uh,

355
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,640
can actually induce hunger.

356
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:31,920
And that's why people
get get the munchies.

357
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:32,851
But you know,

358
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:37,740
that is not necessarily a bad thing
if you're someone who has cancer or if

359
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:38,850
you're someone you know,

360
00:09:38,851 --> 00:09:39,070
who,

361
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,320
who's wasting away from,

362
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:40,560
from,

363
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,640
from a terrible illness.

364
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,040
You know,

365
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,873
sometimes,

366
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,260
you know,

367
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:43,900
having,

368
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,310
uh,

369
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,350
having the munchies is,

370
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,890
is definitely a good thing.

371
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:47,730
Um,

372
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,171
and I know,

373
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:48,361
you know,

374
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:50,570
a lot of people have said to me,

375
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:50,760
you know,

376
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,660
it's not available so you should
probably not talk about as much,

377
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:57,760
but there is another
cannabinoid called THCV.

378
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,681
So you know,

379
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,020
there's,

380
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,130
there's over a hundred cannabinoids
in cannabis cheat seeing CD early,

381
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:02,660
two of them,

382
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:02,940
you know,

383
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,500
those are the main ones
that people know about.

384
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,250
So THCV has been shown to
actually reduce appetite.

385
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,340
So if we can get that
out there in the market,

386
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:11,731
you know,

387
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:12,391
like we have with,

388
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:13,224
with CBD,

389
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,500
then we can almost seal,

390
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,620
eliminate or potentially,

391
00:10:16,621 --> 00:10:16,950
you know,

392
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,500
substantially reduced the
problem that people have with,

393
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:19,980
with,

394
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,270
with THC by using it,

395
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:21,630
uh,

396
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:21,921
with,

397
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:22,090
uh,

398
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,510
THCV darker.

399
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,600
And I have a question for you.

400
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:26,160
When people come into your practice,

401
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,083
did they,

402
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:31,120
do they want high CBD products or did
they want to get intoxicated and no,

403
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,143
absolutely.

404
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,163
Absolutely.

405
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:33,451
Sure.

406
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:33,811
Of course.

407
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:34,011
Yeah.

408
00:10:34,011 --> 00:10:37,000
So it's like if they don't need
to go to him to get intoxicated.

409
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,531
So people,

410
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:40,950
so you're seeing a population that
is genuinely interested in the health

411
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:41,401
benefits?

412
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:42,121
Absolutely,

413
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:43,200
because I mean if,

414
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,940
and I mean I'm glad that that,

415
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:45,121
uh,

416
00:10:45,121 --> 00:10:48,330
that's legalized in Canada because it
does make my job a little bit easier

417
00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:51,360
because be like basically
everyone who is coming to me now,

418
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:54,300
I know that they want to use it
medically because if they want use it

419
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:55,134
recreationally,

420
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,970
I mean they just go to the store,

421
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,241
right?

422
00:10:57,241 --> 00:11:01,620
Cause it's kind of a pain to get in to
see me come in and have the discussion,

423
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,371
all that type of stuff.

424
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:03,001
So you know,

425
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:04,110
the people who see me now,

426
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:04,620
um,

427
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:04,771
you know,

428
00:11:04,771 --> 00:11:06,060
they're all using it medically.

429
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:06,800
Um,

430
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,350
and then,

431
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,591
you know,

432
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:09,120
to answer your question though,

433
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:09,810
Alex,

434
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,100
almost all my patients,

435
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:12,150
as soon as they come in,

436
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,590
they say I don't want to get high.

437
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,520
I don't want to get high.

438
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,470
Like that's almost what everyone says.

439
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,130
So,

440
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:17,401
you know,

441
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:20,340
I think the word is out there that uh,

442
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:20,581
you know,

443
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:23,610
CBD is non psychoactive and
it doesn't get you high.

444
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,060
And I think that a lot of people are
really interested in that compound.

445
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,140
And you know,

446
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:28,490
if,

447
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:28,960
if,

448
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,610
if the people didn't have the success
that they've had over the past few years,

449
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:33,061
you know,

450
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:34,830
it wouldn't be as popular as it is.

451
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:35,350
So,

452
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,610
you know,

453
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,443
I think that,

454
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:36,850
um,

455
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:36,990
you know,

456
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,210
we do need to look at
the scientific evidence,

457
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,800
but we do need to listen to others.

458
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,390
And the anecdotal evidence is,

459
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:42,720
you know,

460
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,231
something that,

461
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,480
that,

462
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,540
that we should consider
because it is so strong.

463
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,201
Alex,

464
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:47,011
let me ask you this.

465
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:51,030
Why don't you consider it medicine
when it has proven medical benefits?

466
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,010
It obviously can be medicine,

467
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,040
these narrow things

468
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,780
that the FDA has approved it for.

469
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,860
But as you know,

470
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,800
I'm sure when people
talk about it as Madison,

471
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:00,500
when the,

472
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:00,930
the,

473
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:01,763
the,

474
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,200
the,

475
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,860
the ballot initiatives that have gotten
it approved as a medicine have really

476
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:08,500
essentially deceive
voters about the process.

477
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,011
Right?

478
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:10,300
So you go to,

479
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:10,730
you,

480
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,550
you go to a pot doctor,

481
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,320
you get an authorization.

482
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,400
That authorization essentially enables
you to buy as much cannabis as you want

483
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:19,360
for the next year.

484
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,580
Most of the time in reality,

485
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:24,580
these doctors are not giving
you a real medical examination.

486
00:12:24,581 --> 00:12:25,151
They're saying to you,

487
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:25,331
Hey,

488
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:25,991
do you have pain?

489
00:12:25,991 --> 00:12:26,771
Do you have anxiety?

490
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:27,940
Here's your authorization.

491
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,760
I don't think you should
speak for every single about.

492
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,793
We don't do that.

493
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,220
Uh,

494
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,001
at my clinic.

495
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:34,660
And I know that,

496
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:34,841
you know,

497
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:36,700
a lot of the clinics in Canada anyway,

498
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,270
uh,

499
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,040
we definitely do not do that.

500
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:39,490
And,

501
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:39,940
uh,

502
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,230
you know,

503
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:44,010
we provide a lot of education at my
clinic and there's other clinics in Canada

504
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,440
also provide education.

505
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:45,820
And,

506
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,210
and I,

507
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,560
and I imagine there's a spectrum,

508
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:48,850
but in the US,

509
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,120
this was a [inaudible].

510
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,580
And I spoke to advocates for my book.

511
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:52,570
I spoke to Rob Kampia,

512
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:52,870
who,

513
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,051
you know,

514
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:55,480
who ran the marijuana policy
project for a long time,

515
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,170
um,

516
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:56,711
for the book.

517
00:12:56,711 --> 00:12:57,544
And He,

518
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,510
and he acknowledged,

519
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,110
you know,

520
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,710
advocates knew that this was a backdoor
route to legalization in the year.

521
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,180
I used to joke around about it.

522
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,550
My doctor said,

523
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:05,770
uh,

524
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,580
why did you do pot?

525
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:06,851
I said,

526
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:07,684
I'd get headaches.

527
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,141
He said,

528
00:13:08,141 --> 00:13:09,010
when do you get headaches?

529
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:09,371
I said,

530
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,170
whenever I think about the
fact that pot's illegal,

531
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,180
so he wrote me a prescription.

532
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:13,361
I mean,

533
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:14,320
let's be honest about it.

534
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,633
I'm not,

535
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,121
look,

536
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:17,110
I say in the book at the end,

537
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,640
I don't think this should be,

538
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,690
this substance should be legal.

539
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:20,920
I have favor decriminalization.

540
00:13:20,921 --> 00:13:22,030
We're just sort of jumping ahead here.

541
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,800
But if it's gonna be legal,

542
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,170
I'd rather have it be
legal for recreational use.

543
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,030
I'd rather that we don't pretend that
THC high cannabis is a medicine and I'd

544
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:32,020
rather separate out.

545
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:34,511
Isn't that same?

546
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:34,610
Uh,

547
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:34,841
yeah.

548
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:37,060
But why are you saying don't pretend?

549
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:40,330
Because there's many medicines
that have horrific side effects.

550
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,280
The medicine,

551
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:47,370
THC in regards to children's autism is
pretty significant and well documented.

552
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,820
The epilepsy,

553
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:49,683
autism,

554
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:54,040
those are two huge things that happen
with children that they've been shown to

555
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,900
severely mitigate with,

556
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,190
with edible marijuana.

557
00:13:57,191 --> 00:13:58,630
So I have to push back
on your a little bit.

558
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:02,860
CBD has been shown to reduce
seizures in children with epilepsy.

559
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,060
It's,

560
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,320
it's improved for the anecdotal,

561
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:10,321
but I have a good friend who has a child
who he uses it on and he showed it.

562
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,980
He mean it's been a game changer.

563
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,331
Yeah.

564
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:14,141
I mean I let just,

565
00:14:14,141 --> 00:14:15,090
let me interrupt for a sec.

566
00:14:15,091 --> 00:14:15,371
Slick.

567
00:14:15,371 --> 00:14:19,090
I had a patient four or
five years ago and uh,

568
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,260
she was 20 years old.

569
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,020
She couldn't drive a car
because she had seizures.

570
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:23,321
Right.

571
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,690
So you can imagine being 20 years old,

572
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,980
not being able to drive a car,

573
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,390
all your friends are driving around.

574
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,420
So she uses a little bit of CBD,

575
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,740
not even every day.

576
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,920
She's never had a seizure saying,

577
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:35,350
okay,

578
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,880
and now she's able to drive her car.

579
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,451
But this is,

580
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:38,710
we're talking about CBD,

581
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,210
he's talking about THC.

582
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,220
And so you're talking about,

583
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,450
you're talking about a case.

584
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:43,930
Okay.

585
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:44,460
And,

586
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,320
and I'm not saying that your
friend's situation didn't happen.

587
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:48,190
I'm not saying it's not real.

588
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:53,191
What I'm saying is that the reason we
have clinical trials is because science,

589
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,840
the way you know whether
a medicine works or not,

590
00:14:56,841 --> 00:14:58,280
whether a chemical compound works,

591
00:14:58,281 --> 00:14:59,540
whatever that company is,

592
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:03,110
the best way to know is you give
it to two groups of you give,

593
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,560
you give the real medicine to one group
of people and you'd give a placebo to

594
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:10,580
the other group and you see the changes
in those two groups over time and you

595
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:11,810
find out whether you're not,

596
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:15,980
your theory about whether this works on
a population level basis is real or not.

597
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,160
That's how that is at the
core of medical science.

598
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:22,430
And we've basically thrown
that rule out for THC.

599
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,920
Well that's not entirely correct.

600
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,800
You do know that there's were studies
that were run during the Nixon

601
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,890
administration that showed the efficacy
of marijuana and the safety of it,

602
00:15:30,891 --> 00:15:31,940
and those were all squashed.

603
00:15:31,941 --> 00:15:32,774
And you also,

604
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,750
I'm sure you know like when
we're talking about marijuana,

605
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,610
you talking about something
that's federally illegal,

606
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:41,560
it's not something that's easy that's
easy to run these FDA studies on.

607
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:41,871
Yes,

608
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:42,420
and I do.

609
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,280
And I said at the end of the book,

610
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:44,450
I think we should drop that.

611
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:48,680
I think anybody who's got a legitimate
interest in researching either THC or

612
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,450
cannabis or any of the compounds for a,

613
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,860
for a medical condition,

614
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,660
let them run phase one,

615
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,081
phase two,

616
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:54,591
phase three,

617
00:15:54,591 --> 00:15:54,891
trust.

618
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:56,420
Let's see if this,

619
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:56,990
if this,

620
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,430
if this plant is good for these things,

621
00:15:58,431 --> 00:15:59,450
I think that's a great idea.

622
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,470
But still,

623
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,640
why you saying that you don't think it
is medicine when all these people find

624
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:05,451
benefit in it?

625
00:16:05,451 --> 00:16:05,990
So,

626
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,510
so do you think they're
getting it from just the CBD,

627
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:11,060
the minimal amount of CBD and marijuana?

628
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:11,361
No,

629
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:12,590
I think that again,

630
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,250
there,

631
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:18,250
there's been a lot of research done on
THC and cannabis to see whether or not

632
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,123
those,

633
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,960
whether THC is a compound in weather,

634
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:21,261
smoke,

635
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:23,120
cannabis can treat these conditions.

636
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,250
And for the most part the
studies have been negative.

637
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:25,791
The,

638
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:26,270
again,

639
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,410
there's negative in what way?

640
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,570
Meaning they haven't shown any actual,

641
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,170
uh,

642
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:30,441
like,

643
00:16:30,441 --> 00:16:33,140
can you stay cite these studies there?

644
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,280
I mentioned that in my book.

645
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,480
Okay.

646
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:35,691
Well,

647
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:36,051
what,

648
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:38,810
what were the conclusions of these studies
when you're saying that they're not

649
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:39,350
positive,

650
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,010
that they,

651
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:40,431
again,

652
00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:42,380
that they didn't work,

653
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:43,880
that the drug didn't work on what?

654
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,710
On cancer,

655
00:16:45,711 --> 00:16:47,030
on Alzheimer's disease,

656
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,590
on irritable bowel syndrome,

657
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:49,330
on.

658
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:49,960
So,

659
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,281
Alex,

660
00:16:50,281 --> 00:16:50,650
I mean,

661
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:50,830
you know,

662
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:53,650
you're throwing a few different
things out there and you know,

663
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,710
I appreciate the fact that
we can't be going around.

664
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,650
You're saying things like,

665
00:16:56,651 --> 00:16:57,040
you know,

666
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,300
cannabis cures cancer,

667
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:58,960
right?

668
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,770
But you know,

669
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,400
I,

670
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,090
uh,

671
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:01,331
you know,

672
00:17:01,331 --> 00:17:05,140
and I've done done videos and this
even like recently stating that,

673
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,030
but if you look at the research,

674
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,000
I mean specifically if you
look at specific cancers,

675
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,520
uh,

676
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,140
there are studies that have
shown that THC and CBD can help.

677
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:14,981
Like it's safe.

678
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:16,120
We're talking about breast cancer.

679
00:17:16,121 --> 00:17:18,010
And I did a video on this recently.

680
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:18,610
You know,

681
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:22,810
if you are her two positive
and you use cheap seeing CBD,

682
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,980
it came in fact,

683
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:24,540
uh,

684
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,520
reduce tumor size and it
can reduce tumor growth.

685
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:28,060
Now,

686
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,900
if you have,

687
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:29,240
what does,

688
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,591
I'm sorry,

689
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:30,310
can I interrupt you?

690
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,143
What does that mean?

691
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,130
What does it subset of breast cancer,

692
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,400
right?

693
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:33,810
So,

694
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:34,510
um,

695
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:34,811
there's,

696
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:38,020
there's different types of breast
cancer and that's just one subset of,

697
00:17:38,021 --> 00:17:38,860
of breast cancer.

698
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:43,270
So there are other breast cancers which
do not express cannabinoid receptors.

699
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:43,691
And you know,

700
00:17:43,691 --> 00:17:45,580
I've seen a one study,

701
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:45,941
at least,

702
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:46,241
again,

703
00:17:46,241 --> 00:17:49,800
it's only one study that show that when
they gave cheats seat and animal model

704
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,140
and actually cause a proliferation of,

705
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:52,621
of tumor,

706
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:53,454
so at worse than them.

707
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:53,930
So,

708
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:54,190
you know,

709
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,400
I do agree with you
Alex and the fact that,

710
00:17:56,401 --> 00:17:56,521
you know,

711
00:17:56,521 --> 00:17:59,940
we have to be careful about
using terms like that,

712
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,910
but that just doesn't mean that we
can't say that cannabis has no good for

713
00:18:02,911 --> 00:18:03,744
cancer at all.

714
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,171
And I mean,

715
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:07,500
even in the National Academies of
Science and Engineering Report,

716
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:07,831
you know,

717
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:08,870
they said that cancer was,

718
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,320
was great for chemotherapy
induced nausea and vomiting.

719
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:12,720
Right.

720
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,140
So,

721
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:13,630
you know,

722
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,630
it's definitely a really good,

723
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,330
um,

724
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:16,590
you know,

725
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,401
medicine for,

726
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:17,581
you know,

727
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:18,540
a lot of different things.

728
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,010
And when we're talking about cheat,

729
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:20,640
see,

730
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,120
you know,

731
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,361
I,

732
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:21,660
uh,

733
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,710
I said earlier of course,

734
00:18:22,711 --> 00:18:23,940
and we need to be careful about,

735
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:24,810
about THC,

736
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,150
but it definitely is still a medicine.

737
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,030
And you know,

738
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,400
to your point with regards to,

739
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,060
um,

740
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,660
you know,

741
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,210
not being a medicine say
for something like Ptsd,

742
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:33,780
you know,

743
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,540
I come from it from a
clinician's point of view,

744
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,280
so I'm not a researcher,

745
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,610
so I need to make sure that my
patients are getting better.

746
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:44,310
It's very frustrating for
me just to say to someone,

747
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:44,641
oh,

748
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:45,810
there's nothing I can do for you.

749
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,930
There's nothing I can do for,

750
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:47,460
you know,

751
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:47,940
so,

752
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,900
and I understand that,

753
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:49,111
you know,

754
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:53,730
doing something sometimes a is not going
to be beneficial just because you're

755
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:54,331
doing something,

756
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:56,040
you have to do something
that actually works.

757
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,030
But,

758
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:57,361
you know,

759
00:18:57,361 --> 00:19:00,210
we do have epidemiological
studies and we have,

760
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:00,570
uh,

761
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,040
other studies have shown that,

762
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:02,730
um,

763
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,220
you know,

764
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:03,481
when,

765
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:05,790
when patients are given a cannabis,

766
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,580
it can reduce their symptoms of PTSD.

767
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,170
There's also another study,

768
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:10,351
you know,

769
00:19:10,351 --> 00:19:11,700
I don't use this drug too often,

770
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:12,630
call it called Nabilone.

771
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:14,790
So nabilone is just pure THC.

772
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,230
Nabilone was shown to reduce
nightmares and people who have PTSD.

773
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,090
So,

774
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:20,400
you know,

775
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,540
it's just saying,

776
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:21,901
just so,

777
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:25,710
just because THC is psychoactive
doesn't mean that it's not a medicine.

778
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,700
And just to keep on the topic of,

779
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,710
of PTSD.

780
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,400
Um,

781
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,181
in addition to that,

782
00:19:30,181 --> 00:19:32,280
we've identified mechanisms of action.

783
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:33,330
Um,

784
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:33,661
I know,

785
00:19:33,661 --> 00:19:33,791
and,

786
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:34,680
and there's one study,

787
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:39,300
I think Matt Hill was on the w was one
of the authors of that study and he

788
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:41,640
noticed that and people who have PTSD,

789
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,820
there's an over 50% decrease in,

790
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:45,181
uh,

791
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:46,560
in levels of [inaudible].

792
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,960
So a nature naturally occurring,

793
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,280
which is,

794
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,500
which is a naturally occurring
in the canal when it correct.

795
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,251
Um,

796
00:19:53,251 --> 00:19:55,050
so you can get that through,

797
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,010
through exercise,

798
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:57,390
which is one excellent way to do it.

799
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,020
And you know,

800
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,980
and that's part of the,

801
00:19:58,981 --> 00:19:59,041
uh,

802
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,320
the high that you get after you exercise.

803
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,560
But the other way that you can
get it is by using cannabis.

804
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,311
So when,

805
00:20:05,311 --> 00:20:05,721
when she,

806
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:07,530
she attaches to those CB one receptors,

807
00:20:07,531 --> 00:20:09,810
you can get a release
of an aunt of mine and,

808
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:10,290
uh,

809
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:14,910
it's kind of a dial can actually increase
in animals by another mechanism of

810
00:20:14,911 --> 00:20:16,020
action as well.

811
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:16,800
So,

812
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,100
you know,

813
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,690
there's different ways where we can,

814
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,110
you know,

815
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,240
raise a level of,

816
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,450
of deficiency.

817
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,050
So,

818
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:22,351
you know,

819
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:23,880
to me as a clinician,

820
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,211
you know,

821
00:20:24,211 --> 00:20:27,270
if I have someone who
is not doing very well,

822
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:27,511
you know,

823
00:20:27,511 --> 00:20:29,520
they've been on a bunch
of different medications,

824
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,020
I've identified that,

825
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,350
you know,

826
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,550
they have PTSD,

827
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:33,960
we have mechanisms of action,

828
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,010
we have studies.

829
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,240
And then again too,

830
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:36,481
you know,

831
00:20:36,481 --> 00:20:38,610
don't discount my clinical experience.

832
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:39,090
Right?

833
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,610
I've been working for over five years,

834
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,260
you know,

835
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:42,861
just with,

836
00:20:42,861 --> 00:20:43,200
uh,

837
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,010
just with cannabis.

838
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:44,280
I mean,

839
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,330
I do other medicines,

840
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:45,760
uh,

841
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,410
I use prescribed other medicines well,

842
00:20:47,411 --> 00:20:50,890
but I've been doing cannabis medicine
for over five years and you know,

843
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,681
there's a lot that,

844
00:20:51,681 --> 00:20:52,514
that I've learned,

845
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:52,841
right?

846
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:54,250
So as much as I've learned,

847
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:54,731
you know,

848
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:55,960
through reading studies,

849
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:56,670
um,

850
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:56,840
and,

851
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,900
and through going to conferences
and things like that,

852
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,411
you know,

853
00:20:59,411 --> 00:21:04,411
for sure that the best resource as a
clinician is to learn from your patients

854
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:07,300
and to hear what your patients tell me.

855
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,250
And you know,

856
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:08,410
the,

857
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,700
the things that my patients tell me is
that THC is really effective for the

858
00:21:12,701 --> 00:21:13,534
sleep at night.

859
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,770
And a lot of my patients,

860
00:21:14,771 --> 00:21:16,180
especially my veteran patients,

861
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,200
have done really,

862
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:18,030
really well with,

863
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:18,730
with that.

864
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,111
And just,

865
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,350
just one further point too,

866
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:20,950
you know,

867
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,611
there was a,

868
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:22,271
I know it was,

869
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:23,830
it was a 2015 I believe it was.

870
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:25,300
There was a Meta analysis done.

871
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,150
I can pull it up if we need
to that indicated that,

872
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:28,810
um,

873
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:28,991
you know,

874
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:33,670
a lot of medicines that are being used
now for PTSD or just simply ineffective.

875
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,330
And the other thing too is that there's
never been a medicine made specifically

876
00:21:37,331 --> 00:21:38,920
for PTSD.

877
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:43,330
So all the medicines that people are
using or for anxiety or for depression or

878
00:21:43,331 --> 00:21:44,170
the for insomnia,

879
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,670
there are there for something else,

880
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,271
you know,

881
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:47,560
but when we look at like,

882
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:52,360
like a study that says people with PTSD
have a lower level of [inaudible] and

883
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:55,120
then if you can increase
that a level of Nando mind,

884
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:55,511
you know,

885
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:57,160
that's a good way to treat someone.

886
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,810
It doesn't matter whether it's a vitamin,

887
00:21:58,811 --> 00:21:59,680
whether it's a hormone,

888
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:02,500
if as long as you are
correcting a deficiency,

889
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,200
you're generally going to get
excellent clinical results.

890
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,250
So let me,

891
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,500
let me sort of try to
frame this a different way.

892
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,430
Um,

893
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:12,070
alcohol reduces blood pressure.

894
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:12,430
Okay.

895
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,520
Alcohol in,

896
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,170
you know,

897
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:17,980
generally tends to reduce
cardiovascular events for people.

898
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,030
Um,

899
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,660
and during prohibition you could actually
get a doctor's note for alcohol as a

900
00:22:22,661 --> 00:22:23,494
medicine,

901
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,090
but alcohol is not a medicine.

902
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:25,451
Okay.

903
00:22:25,451 --> 00:22:26,920
It's a recreational intoxicant.

904
00:22:26,921 --> 00:22:31,000
It has some positive biological
qualities and some negative biological

905
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:31,834
qualities.

906
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,561
And you know,

907
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:36,160
there was an argument I think in 10 to
20 years ago should we recommend that

908
00:22:36,161 --> 00:22:39,280
people drink moderately
one to two drinks a day.

909
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,540
And I think for the most part,

910
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:40,930
uh,

911
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,510
the medical profession has come
down on the side of saying,

912
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,800
let's not do that.

913
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,770
There's too many noncardiac uh,

914
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,600
negative side effects with alcohol.

915
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,660
Just on that note though,

916
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,040
Alex in Canada right now,

917
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:56,420
I know the safe alcohol
drinking guidelines are 14
drinks per week for men and

918
00:22:56,421 --> 00:22:57,690
nine drinks a week for,

919
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:58,221
for women.

920
00:22:58,221 --> 00:22:58,800
So,

921
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,180
you know,

922
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,040
basically to sue a day for men,

923
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:01,874
one and a half.

924
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,350
I see.

925
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:02,891
So you're saying,

926
00:23:02,891 --> 00:23:03,430
okay,

927
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,240
like there's,

928
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,120
we don't see huge negative
consequences at that level.

929
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,073
Okay.

930
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,153
That's,

931
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:10,443
that's fine.

932
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,360
That's a totally reasonable
way to think about alcohol.

933
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,070
But what we're not saying that people was,

934
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,240
this is a medicine.

935
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:20,710
And I think that's where the confusion
around really around high THC,

936
00:23:20,711 --> 00:23:21,730
cannabis lies.

937
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:22,510
And I,

938
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:22,900
and again,

939
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,990
I don't mean to say that your
friend's child is not benefiting.

940
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,820
I if you say,

941
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:28,170
uh,

942
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,110
he or she's benefiting.

943
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,973
I believe you.

944
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,040
What I'm saying is that that's
not good enough for science.

945
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,440
We need randomized controlled trials.

946
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,320
And when those trials have been done
and a lot of them have been done,

947
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:38,710
Joe,

948
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,880
a lot of them have been done.

949
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,080
They've almost unequivocally showing
the cannabis doesn't work as a medicine,

950
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,100
the only actual place where beyond

951
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,880
these sort of very limited conditions
like chemotherapy associated nausea,

952
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:52,070
which obviously is terrible
for people who have it,

953
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:52,880
but isn't,

954
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,780
isn't that common?

955
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:54,614
Fortunately,

956
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:55,220
um,

957
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,560
cannabis has been shown to
work as a pain reliever,

958
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:57,981
right?

959
00:23:57,981 --> 00:24:01,160
Probably for the same reasons that
alcohol works as a pain reliever sort of

960
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:02,780
dulls your awareness of your pain.

961
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,950
But even in that study or in those,

962
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,180
even in those studies,

963
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:09,980
they're mostly done against placebo,

964
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:14,150
not against opioids or against
and ceds like Ibuprofen.

965
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:19,630
And there was a very big
study for cannabis use in
chronic pain over a multiyear

966
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:21,830
period,

967
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,340
uh,

968
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,390
in Australia that came out last year
that showed that people who used cannabis

969
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,440
had a,

970
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,273
uh,

971
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,790
had more pain and use more
opiates at the end of four years.

972
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,750
Then people who didn't.

973
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:33,560
So that,

974
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,140
so I would almost argue
about what medicine is.

975
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,010
Yeah.

976
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:40,190
That study though had
a lot of flaws in it.

977
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:44,570
And the other thing is that you need
to look at someone who is already using

978
00:24:44,571 --> 00:24:47,600
cannabis versus someone
who is just using opioids.

979
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:52,250
So if someone is just using opioids
and they want to come off cannabis,

980
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:52,880
um,

981
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,031
you know,

982
00:24:53,031 --> 00:24:56,330
those Malcolm off opiates oil
come off of opiates with cannabis,

983
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:56,841
you know,

984
00:24:56,841 --> 00:25:00,380
multiple studies have shown
that that that can be effective.

985
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,650
And that's not was the what was done
in the Australian study that you're

986
00:25:03,651 --> 00:25:06,360
referring to get a more
naturalistic approach.

987
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:06,700
Right.

988
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:06,911
And,

989
00:25:06,911 --> 00:25:07,940
and also too,

990
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:08,181
you know,

991
00:25:08,181 --> 00:25:08,510
they,

992
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:12,200
they didn't have access to medical
marijuana during that whole,

993
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,220
during that whole time.

994
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,400
Those are all self reported
and they were getting it from,

995
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:16,610
you know,

996
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:17,840
recreational sources.

997
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,310
They weren't getting it from.

998
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,091
That's a big,

999
00:25:20,091 --> 00:25:21,830
that's a big distinction though Alex.

1000
00:25:21,831 --> 00:25:24,530
Like they weren't getting it
from a doctor who prescribed it.

1001
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:25,010
Two of them,

1002
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:25,590
they were there.

1003
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:30,060
This was a self reported study and people
are getting cannabis that you know,

1004
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,850
they didn't really know
what they were getting.

1005
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,790
It wasn't a,

1006
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,470
they weren't given any information from
a doctor and that's why it's a medicine

1007
00:25:36,471 --> 00:25:36,771
Alex,

1008
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:38,900
because you can tell someone,

1009
00:25:38,901 --> 00:25:40,670
you can tell a patient to take,

1010
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:41,180
you know,

1011
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,840
a certain amount of CBD every single
day and when you take a certain amount

1012
00:25:44,841 --> 00:25:45,650
every single day,

1013
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,890
it can reduce your symptoms and
sometimes you need to increase that and

1014
00:25:48,891 --> 00:25:50,200
sometimes you need to decrease.

1015
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,710
I think we should do
that with all medicines.

1016
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,540
We should be really clear
about the distinction though,

1017
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:55,490
between CBD and marijuana.

1018
00:25:55,491 --> 00:25:55,821
I mean we're,

1019
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:58,190
we're really talking about the
psychoactive version of it.

1020
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,061
This is where,

1021
00:25:59,061 --> 00:26:00,380
where you're saying it's negative,

1022
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,130
you're not,

1023
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:05,540
you're not really arguing that
CVD dr hardest talking about,

1024
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,610
he's talking about using
this as a medicine.

1025
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,990
Certainly using the CVD.

1026
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,370
He's titrating his patients,

1027
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,540
he's monitoring them.

1028
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,780
He's not writing them an authorization
and saint come back in a year when it,

1029
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,673
when it's up,

1030
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,310
he's,

1031
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:16,880
he's,

1032
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,100
he's being a physician and you know,

1033
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:22,460
and I think to the extent
that marijuana is medicine,

1034
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:23,750
we want people like him.

1035
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,280
So you were admitted it's medicine.

1036
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:25,521
No,

1037
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:25,701
no,

1038
00:26:25,701 --> 00:26:26,000
no.

1039
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,870
I don't admit that.

1040
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,753
But you just said that.

1041
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,960
I don't think I just said that

1042
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,500
cause I think I said to the
extent I'm trying to meet you,

1043
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,260
I'll stop doing that.

1044
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:37,520
Um,

1045
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:37,940
uh,

1046
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,420
but you know,

1047
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,760
I think you said something else
that was really interesting to me.

1048
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:42,260
And this came up in the book too.

1049
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:43,890
So you're a clinician,

1050
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,380
you see sick people and you know,

1051
00:26:46,381 --> 00:26:46,621
it's funny,

1052
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:47,940
my wife's a doctor too.

1053
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:48,810
She's a psychiatrist.

1054
00:26:48,811 --> 00:26:49,890
That's how I sort of got hidden this.

1055
00:26:49,891 --> 00:26:53,700
But my wife is a forensic psychiatrist
less than a clinician these days.

1056
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,290
Her job is to evaluate people,

1057
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,790
not so much to treat people.

1058
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,710
Your job is to treat people.

1059
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,730
You see sick people.

1060
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,840
You want to help them feel better
and you don't want to tell them,

1061
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,040
there's nothing I can do for you.

1062
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:05,830
There's nothing,

1063
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,050
there's no hope for your pain.

1064
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:08,400
There's no hope for your PTSD.

1065
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:09,690
You want to help them.

1066
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,190
And I totally get that.

1067
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,480
But if you're an epidemiologist
or a researcher who's,

1068
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,820
who's trying to guide the,

1069
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,250
you know,

1070
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,880
the views on the medical practice
of hundreds of thousands of doctors,

1071
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:21,930
that's not good enough.

1072
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,790
So you need to step back.

1073
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:24,923
And I think,

1074
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:25,980
I think you know,

1075
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:26,191
this,

1076
00:27:26,191 --> 00:27:28,800
this epidemiologist in in
Britain who I talked to,

1077
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:29,311
he said to me,

1078
00:27:29,311 --> 00:27:29,910
he said,

1079
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:30,210
you know,

1080
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:34,410
I try not to draw conclusions because
so often when I try to draw them,

1081
00:27:34,411 --> 00:27:35,244
I'm wrong.

1082
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:35,980
Yeah.

1083
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,550
And we need to be careful about that.

1084
00:27:38,551 --> 00:27:38,791
Right.

1085
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:39,070
And,

1086
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,751
and Alex,

1087
00:27:39,751 --> 00:27:40,070
you know,

1088
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,650
you know,

1089
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,450
one thing that was mentioned in your book,

1090
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:43,230
um,

1091
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:43,541
you know,

1092
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:44,010
it was that,

1093
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:44,320
you know,

1094
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,120
you often,

1095
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,090
you often cited the national
academies of science and Engineering,

1096
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,421
right?

1097
00:27:48,421 --> 00:27:49,050
But,

1098
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:49,380
you know,

1099
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,310
Ziva Cooper,

1100
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:50,521
you know,

1101
00:27:50,521 --> 00:27:52,050
she's a member of that committee.

1102
00:27:52,051 --> 00:27:52,710
I mean,

1103
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,450
she put out on our Twitter,

1104
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:54,631
I mean,

1105
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:55,351
you can go to it.

1106
00:27:55,351 --> 00:28:00,351
It's from January 9th of 2019 she says
in response in the recent year times

1107
00:28:00,751 --> 00:28:03,180
editorial on cannabis and
as a committee member,

1108
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:04,743
which by the way,

1109
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,013
let me finish,

1110
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,700
let me finish finish context
of where it came from,

1111
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,140
but this is someone you site,

1112
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,690
Knight inside her excited,

1113
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:16,020
you cited the report and
she's a member of that,

1114
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:16,770
all of that.

1115
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:17,340
Okay.

1116
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:21,540
So she said in response to the recent
New York Times editorial on cannabis as a

1117
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:23,370
committee member on NASA,

1118
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,740
which is that committee
and cannabinoids support,

1119
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,610
we did not conclude that
cannabis causes schizophrenia.

1120
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:34,680
Then the drug alliance policy also
said the report did not reach that

1121
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:35,514
conclusion.

1122
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:38,610
So those are pretty too authoritative.

1123
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,440
Uh,

1124
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:39,630
you know,

1125
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,190
sources that are saying that,

1126
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:41,581
you know,

1127
00:28:41,581 --> 00:28:45,030
in your book you didn't
cite the research properly.

1128
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:45,570
Right.

1129
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:48,240
And then also they're saying
that you left a lot out,

1130
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:48,781
right?

1131
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:53,400
They said that they have
found an association between
marijuana use and improved

1132
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,780
cognitive outcomes and individuals with
psychotic disorders that straight from

1133
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:58,650
the same report.

1134
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,610
And you know,

1135
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,350
you failed to mention that.

1136
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:01,591
Right?

1137
00:29:01,591 --> 00:29:02,850
So I think that,

1138
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:03,570
you know,

1139
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,090
when we're writing books or when
we're giving out information,

1140
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:06,480
you know,

1141
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,380
you want to do it from a balanced approach
and you don't want to just select,

1142
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:10,591
you know,

1143
00:29:10,591 --> 00:29:14,730
the small amount of material that's
just going to support your study.

1144
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,211
You know,

1145
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,710
we want to be truthful here.

1146
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,130
You know,

1147
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,670
Joe's show is always been very,

1148
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,523
very truthful.

1149
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:19,801
I mean,

1150
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:20,221
Joe said,

1151
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:20,430
right,

1152
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,091
right at the beginning,

1153
00:29:21,091 --> 00:29:21,960
he doesn't think that,

1154
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:22,370
uh,

1155
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:22,610
that,

1156
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:26,100
that cannabis is perfect for everyone
and I don't think that either.

1157
00:29:26,101 --> 00:29:29,460
And in Canada we have really
strict guidelines to follow.

1158
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,240
Um,

1159
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,600
you know,

1160
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,790
basically no one prescribes chia seed,

1161
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:34,470
anyone under the age of,

1162
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,770
of 25 and you know,

1163
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,030
all the conferences
and stuff that I go to,

1164
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:39,810
you know,

1165
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,830
we don't really have too
many discussions about that.

1166
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:43,570
Like the doctors don't really have many,

1167
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,380
you know,

1168
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,730
much of a backlash about that.

1169
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:46,570
Um,

1170
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:49,930
so why is the distinction the age
of 25 or they've decided that age?

1171
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,540
So 25 basically is when you're,

1172
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:53,310
you're fighting it.

1173
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:53,600
Yeah,

1174
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:53,950
it's fun.

1175
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:54,070
It's,

1176
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:54,280
it's,

1177
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,180
it's fully developed.

1178
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,980
And when you do look at the studies
that do show an association between,

1179
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,690
between cannabis and psychosis,

1180
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,390
it's almost all in adolescence.

1181
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:04,751
You know,

1182
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:07,600
I think that Alex only has one study,

1183
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,260
um,

1184
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:08,480
and,

1185
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,480
and his and his book that
shows an extremely weak
correlation between an adult

1186
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:16,020
using cannabis and then
developing any type of,

1187
00:30:16,021 --> 00:30:17,260
of mental illness later.

1188
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:17,830
So,

1189
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,280
you know,

1190
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,120
25,

1191
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,100
um,

1192
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,330
is,

1193
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:20,561
is,

1194
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:20,830
uh,

1195
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:21,551
it's a good age,

1196
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:22,540
but it's definitely a,

1197
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:22,780
you know,

1198
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,330
kind of a conservative ish,

1199
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,193
ish age.

1200
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:26,530
But,

1201
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:26,741
you know,

1202
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:27,131
it's,

1203
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:27,601
it's something that,

1204
00:30:27,601 --> 00:30:28,211
that we follow.

1205
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:28,950
And I think that,

1206
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:29,170
you know,

1207
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,400
we've done well with that in Canada.

1208
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,031
So Alex,

1209
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:32,680
why did you leave those conclusions?

1210
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,780
I need to push back here.

1211
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,510
Okay.

1212
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:40,510
So the National Academy of Medicine
report was drawn up by committee of 16

1213
00:30:40,701 --> 00:30:41,534
researchers.

1214
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:42,350
Uh,

1215
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:47,120
Ziva Cooper is the one who's
publicly said the reports said this.

1216
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,033
Uh,

1217
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:50,330
but I think that we should have,

1218
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,230
uh,

1219
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,180
emphasize that it also said this.

1220
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,020
Okay.

1221
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,800
What I,

1222
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,930
what I wrote in that New York Times op Ed.

1223
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:57,321
Uh,

1224
00:30:57,321 --> 00:31:01,280
what I wrote in the book is the plain
language of the report and the plain

1225
00:31:01,281 --> 00:31:06,281
language is this cannabis use is
associated with a risk of developing

1226
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:08,090
schizophrenia and other psychosis.

1227
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,290
The higher the use,

1228
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,400
the greater the risk.

1229
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,860
I may have a word or two wrong in
that cause I'm doing it from memory,

1230
00:31:12,861 --> 00:31:13,790
but that's what it said.

1231
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,200
And by the way,

1232
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,180
the committee was very clear.

1233
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,090
They separated a depression.

1234
00:31:20,091 --> 00:31:23,420
They said there we don't see as
nearly as high risk for depression and

1235
00:31:23,421 --> 00:31:24,254
psychosis.

1236
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:24,770
Uh,

1237
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:25,131
even though,

1238
00:31:25,131 --> 00:31:26,030
by the way today,

1239
00:31:26,031 --> 00:31:26,900
just today,

1240
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:28,640
a Jama Psychiatry,

1241
00:31:28,641 --> 00:31:31,190
the Journal of the American
Medical Association Psychiatry,

1242
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:31,940
uh,

1243
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,940
put out a Meta analysis showing that
cannabis is associated with depression and

1244
00:31:38,001 --> 00:31:39,200
suicidal thinking,

1245
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,130
uh,

1246
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:43,070
and actually suicide attempts at
a three and a half to one rate.

1247
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:43,341
This,

1248
00:31:43,341 --> 00:31:44,810
this literally was released today.

1249
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,680
Um,

1250
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,130
but to,

1251
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:46,963
but to go back,

1252
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,610
Ziva is one of 16 members
of that committee.

1253
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,630
So if you're going to talk,

1254
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,580
if you're going to say that
I misquoted the report,

1255
00:31:52,581 --> 00:31:53,001
which I did,

1256
00:31:53,001 --> 00:31:54,530
and I quoted an entirely accurately,

1257
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,401
you need to say,

1258
00:31:55,401 --> 00:31:56,060
well,

1259
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:59,360
why aren't the other 15 members of
that committee saying that I misquoted.

1260
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:03,830
Why is one person who works for the
cannabis research initiative at Ucla,

1261
00:32:03,831 --> 00:32:06,770
which takes money from
cannabis investors and users?

1262
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,140
She's the one who said
that I misquoted it.

1263
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,310
Maybe she,

1264
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:14,030
maybe we should ask why the other members
of the committee are not speaking out

1265
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:14,960
against my book.

1266
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:16,010
Well,

1267
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:19,340
I think that she was just one of
the 16 members that that came out.

1268
00:32:19,341 --> 00:32:19,761
But you know,

1269
00:32:19,761 --> 00:32:22,340
you can't really expect a
all the other members to,

1270
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:23,174
to potentially,

1271
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:23,361
you know,

1272
00:32:23,361 --> 00:32:24,194
comb out with that.

1273
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:25,560
Why not?

1274
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:25,711
Well,

1275
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:27,540
some people did something wrong.

1276
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:28,374
If I misquoted,

1277
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,990
some people will and some people won't.

1278
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:30,171
You know,

1279
00:32:30,171 --> 00:32:31,100
some people have,

1280
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:31,401
you know,

1281
00:32:31,401 --> 00:32:32,211
the personality.

1282
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:33,620
Some people have the platform,

1283
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:36,500
like Ziva has a bunch of
followers on our Twitter.

1284
00:32:36,501 --> 00:32:37,640
People know who she is.

1285
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,001
You know,

1286
00:32:38,001 --> 00:32:41,870
a lot of people who do research actually
are not into social media at all.

1287
00:32:41,871 --> 00:32:42,021
Like,

1288
00:32:42,021 --> 00:32:44,720
I don't think you were at
all before you had your book.

1289
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:45,554
Where are you?

1290
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:46,970
Right.

1291
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:47,340
Okay.

1292
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:47,780
Yeah.

1293
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,490
So you were an in a social media at all.

1294
00:32:49,491 --> 00:32:50,020
So,

1295
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:50,330
you know,

1296
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:53,020
I don't think that most
people on that committee are,

1297
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,140
are into social media.

1298
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:54,321
You know,

1299
00:32:54,321 --> 00:32:55,130
Ziva just,

1300
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,040
just happens to be,

1301
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:56,420
and you know,

1302
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,620
I even spoke to Ziva,

1303
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,400
uh,

1304
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,960
on the phone about this and you know,

1305
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,180
and,

1306
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:00,411
and,

1307
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:01,700
and she said that,

1308
00:33:01,701 --> 00:33:02,030
yeah,

1309
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:02,291
you know,

1310
00:33:02,291 --> 00:33:02,550
I,

1311
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,383
I don't,

1312
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:03,740
uh,

1313
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,410
that she agrees with everything
that was in the report,

1314
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,900
but she doesn't agree
with your conclusions.

1315
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,750
And to go back to what's
quoted from the report,

1316
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,580
but you're only quoting there,

1317
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,770
but you're only quoting the parts that,

1318
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:18,410
that site or soy that back your,

1319
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,070
uh,

1320
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,210
your opinions.

1321
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,330
You're not quoting the
entire part like you left.

1322
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:23,690
Like,

1323
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:27,530
why did you leave out the part that said
they have found an association between

1324
00:33:27,531 --> 00:33:31,040
marijuana use and improved cognitive
outcomes in individuals with psychotic

1325
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:31,790
disorders.

1326
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,061
Right.

1327
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:33,260
So you're leaving out that,

1328
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,780
why did you leave out that part?

1329
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:39,290
If you can find me a psychiatrist who
thinks that it's a good idea for somebody

1330
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:40,860
with an active psychotic disorder.

1331
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,230
That part,

1332
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,220
why'd you leave out that part?

1333
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:43,521
Well,

1334
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,630
my book presents,

1335
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,430
it makes a case,

1336
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,150
right?

1337
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:52,150
It makes a case that this is a big issue
that we have not heard about at all and

1338
00:33:52,461 --> 00:33:54,980
the reasons that we haven't heard about
it have a lot to do with the advocacy

1339
00:33:54,981 --> 00:33:58,070
community and the way they've
presented this data for 25 years.

1340
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:02,090
I wrote a book that is trying
to break through a lot of noise,

1341
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:07,340
so but still like to
get a balanced approach.

1342
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:12,520
Did you decide that you were only going
to write about things that confirm your

1343
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:19,010
belief that you held when you were writing
this and what you were trying to push

1344
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,310
and the title of the book and then
in the conclusion of the book?

1345
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,570
I think that's a really great question.

1346
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,610
I say in the introduction to the book,

1347
00:34:25,611 --> 00:34:26,810
this book is not balanced.

1348
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,790
There's not a lot of evidence in there.

1349
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:29,390
If you want to fair,

1350
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:32,750
if you want to read about how indicas
and sativas strains are different.

1351
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:33,584
And you know,

1352
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,030
you're not going to
read that in this book,

1353
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,913
this,

1354
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,460
but I will also,

1355
00:34:37,461 --> 00:34:38,720
I also want to say this,

1356
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,570
I didn't come at this and I say this
in the introduction of the book too,

1357
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,400
as an anti cannabis crusader.

1358
00:34:43,401 --> 00:34:43,701
In fact,

1359
00:34:43,701 --> 00:34:48,350
when my wife said to me and she said to
me over and over again in 2014 and 15

1360
00:34:48,351 --> 00:34:49,130
and 16,

1361
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,480
these are the cases that I'm seeing.

1362
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:53,720
These are the terrible things that
people are doing after cannabis use.

1363
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,880
I sort of said to her at first of all,

1364
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:58,850
why do I always have to hear
about this at the dinner table?

1365
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,471
But,

1366
00:34:59,471 --> 00:34:59,590
uh,

1367
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,680
but more importantly,

1368
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,783
um,

1369
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,271
you know,

1370
00:35:02,271 --> 00:35:03,104
why,

1371
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:07,640
why is it that maybe these
people were using other drugs?

1372
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,180
Maybe,

1373
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,930
maybe you're seeing a slice of the
population that it's not representative.

1374
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,610
Why is it that I should believe this?

1375
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,080
This sounds like reefer madness to me.

1376
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:15,501
And,

1377
00:35:15,501 --> 00:35:15,711
you know,

1378
00:35:15,711 --> 00:35:16,700
ultimately my wife,

1379
00:35:16,701 --> 00:35:17,600
who's the one who went to,

1380
00:35:17,601 --> 00:35:17,790
you know,

1381
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:18,623
she actually,

1382
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,540
as I was talking to
doctor heart about this,

1383
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,650
she grew up in,

1384
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,130
uh,

1385
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:23,360
in Newfoundland to,

1386
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:23,711
uh,

1387
00:35:23,711 --> 00:35:27,320
and she went to the Memorial University
of Newfoundland Medical School and she

1388
00:35:27,321 --> 00:35:30,020
went to Harvard and Columbia
for her postgraduate training.

1389
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:30,651
Uh,

1390
00:35:30,651 --> 00:35:30,861
you know,

1391
00:35:30,861 --> 00:35:33,890
eventually she got tired of me
yapping back at her and she said,

1392
00:35:33,891 --> 00:35:35,510
why don't you go read
the studies yourself?

1393
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:36,920
And it was that,

1394
00:35:36,921 --> 00:35:37,754
that led me to read,

1395
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,220
to write

1396
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,050
this book because when I read the studies,

1397
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:42,570
I could not believe the
strength of the evidence Joe.

1398
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,390
But you're still even
in saying that you're,

1399
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:48,240
you're still seeing positive
results that you're,

1400
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,830
you're excluding.

1401
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,031
There's,

1402
00:35:51,031 --> 00:35:52,050
there's this one,

1403
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,490
there's this one sentence.

1404
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:53,811
I mean,

1405
00:35:53,811 --> 00:35:54,490
it's not just one sense,

1406
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:54,780
but,

1407
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:59,780
but there are a few sentences about how
it may be that cannabis helps people is

1408
00:36:01,921 --> 00:36:04,140
positive because it helps,

1409
00:36:04,141 --> 00:36:06,090
it helps cognition in
people with psychosis.

1410
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,571
Maybe,

1411
00:36:06,571 --> 00:36:07,110
maybe not.

1412
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,880
Wouldn't that qualify as medicine?

1413
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,103
Uh,

1414
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:10,830
not if it's,

1415
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:11,131
no,

1416
00:36:11,131 --> 00:36:12,330
it wouldn't be approved as medicine.

1417
00:36:12,331 --> 00:36:14,250
If it's causing you to have
other psychotic episodes.

1418
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:19,320
These people have psychotic breaks and
improves cognitive function and people

1419
00:36:19,321 --> 00:36:20,460
with psychotic breaks.

1420
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,220
So,

1421
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,570
so wouldn't that be something that
you would prescribe to someone?

1422
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:25,021
No.

1423
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:25,440
Again,

1424
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,590
you had need to think about how
the FDA is looking at medicine.

1425
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:27,721
No,

1426
00:36:27,721 --> 00:36:29,430
I understand the FDA's position.

1427
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:29,610
Sure.

1428
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,470
But I mean looking at it as medicine,

1429
00:36:31,471 --> 00:36:35,250
I mean if we could prove this through
studies and through some sort of clinical

1430
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:35,940
trials,

1431
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,460
if it is improving your Iq two
points on a test and I'm saying,

1432
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,190
oh it is,

1433
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:40,650
I'm not,

1434
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,483
I think

1435
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,411
I'd have to look at that.

1436
00:36:43,411 --> 00:36:44,244
I'm not sure.

1437
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:48,330
But at the same time it's making you no,

1438
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:48,801
no.

1439
00:36:48,801 --> 00:36:49,160
It's a few.

1440
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:49,950
But it's time.

1441
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,630
It's making you floridly psychotic.

1442
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,350
You're not,

1443
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,190
that's not medicine.

1444
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:53,341
Well,

1445
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:54,091
it's not necessarily.

1446
00:36:54,091 --> 00:36:54,751
At the same time,

1447
00:36:54,751 --> 00:36:57,780
one of the things that I read about
schizophrenia and was that there's people

1448
00:36:57,781 --> 00:37:00,630
who are trying to make a correlation
between marijuana use and schizophrenia.

1449
00:37:00,631 --> 00:37:02,310
But the problem with that correlation,

1450
00:37:02,311 --> 00:37:03,091
and what I read,

1451
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:04,170
and maybe you could help me on this,

1452
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,340
was that it's the exact same number
that you find the general population.

1453
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:12,150
It's essentially 1% of the general
population has schizophrenia,

1454
00:37:12,151 --> 00:37:13,590
which is one out of 100 people.

1455
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,870
And when you have marijuana users,

1456
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,020
you see it's essentially
that same number mirrored.

1457
00:37:19,021 --> 00:37:20,730
And so they're saying that a small number,

1458
00:37:20,731 --> 00:37:21,510
that's not true.

1459
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:21,910
Hold on,

1460
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:24,930
let me get in a small number of people.

1461
00:37:24,931 --> 00:37:29,160
What they were saying essentially in
what I read was that marijuana use was

1462
00:37:29,161 --> 00:37:32,340
associated with the
onset of schizophrenia.

1463
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,890
They were disputing this in this
study because they were saying,

1464
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:38,340
but because then same number is
mirrored in the general population.

1465
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:38,701
Again,

1466
00:37:38,701 --> 00:37:40,410
correlation does not equal causation.

1467
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:40,720
Right.

1468
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,310
Dr Hard,

1469
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,810
I think you got to tell
him that's not true.

1470
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,673
So tell me,

1471
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,411
tell me what that means.

1472
00:37:44,411 --> 00:37:45,540
So traditionally,

1473
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:45,911
yes,

1474
00:37:45,911 --> 00:37:47,160
when we look up the stats,

1475
00:37:47,161 --> 00:37:50,460
you'll see that you know the people who
use cannabis versus the people who don't

1476
00:37:50,461 --> 00:37:52,500
use cannabis have very similar rates.

1477
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:54,690
But you're getting to the exact rates.

1478
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:57,090
So in the u s they say that,

1479
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:57,581
uh,

1480
00:37:57,581 --> 00:37:58,290
the range,

1481
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:03,240
if the for schizophrenia is
between 0.25 to 0.64% globally,

1482
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:06,030
they say it's 0.33 to 0.75%.

1483
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,900
So,

1484
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,111
you know,

1485
00:38:07,111 --> 00:38:07,651
right there,

1486
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:08,070
it's,

1487
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:08,490
you know,

1488
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:11,880
apparently lower ain in
the u s and the u s is,

1489
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:12,360
is,

1490
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,020
has the highest percentage of
cannabis consumption in the world.

1491
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,910
And the US also has a lot of people
that are using high potency THC.

1492
00:38:20,911 --> 00:38:21,510
So,

1493
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,200
you know,

1494
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:22,771
I think that,

1495
00:38:22,771 --> 00:38:22,921
you know,

1496
00:38:22,921 --> 00:38:23,940
we really need to be,

1497
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:27,120
be careful about throwing out
stats like that because you know,

1498
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:29,220
when you do look at
the stats that we have,

1499
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,200
it shows that even though,

1500
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:31,650
uh,

1501
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:31,900
you know,

1502
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,160
the,

1503
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,520
the,

1504
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,950
there's a lot of canvas
use in the United States,

1505
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,010
schizophrenia

1506
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,200
rates have remained the same.

1507
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,660
So I have to push back really hard on,

1508
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:41,110
this is one of the great
myths of legalization.

1509
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,900
No one knows what the schizophrenia or
psychosis rate in the is in the u s a lot

1510
00:38:46,901 --> 00:38:47,734
of people aren't treated,

1511
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,410
people are treated people.

1512
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:52,180
I'll get different diagnoses
at different times and we have,

1513
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:56,050
we have bad health care in this country
and we have a lot of protections around

1514
00:38:56,051 --> 00:38:56,800
mental health.

1515
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,281
In fact,

1516
00:38:57,281 --> 00:39:02,281
in 2017 than national institutes of mental
health suddenly changed its estimate

1517
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:08,731
for the percentage of people
with schizophrenia in the
US from 1.1% to 0.3% they

1518
00:39:08,831 --> 00:39:10,120
did it with no public notice.

1519
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,830
And then this researcher said,

1520
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,221
hey,

1521
00:39:12,221 --> 00:39:13,090
this is a miracle.

1522
00:39:13,091 --> 00:39:16,120
They just cured 2 million people
with schizophrenia and the,

1523
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:17,470
and then in response to that,

1524
00:39:17,471 --> 00:39:19,120
the director of the NIH said,

1525
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:19,720
um,

1526
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,660
well we actually don't know how many
people have schizophrenia in the United

1527
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:22,810
States.

1528
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:23,740
Nobody knows,

1529
00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:25,300
nobody knows if the rate is increasing.

1530
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,590
Nobody knows if it's decreasing.

1531
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:31,570
The only countries where they can
count noses on this with any accuracy.

1532
00:39:31,571 --> 00:39:32,470
Our northern Europe,

1533
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:36,010
because they have good healthcare because
they have slightly less protections

1534
00:39:36,011 --> 00:39:39,550
around sort of individual privacy
and mental health privacy.

1535
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,200
And so they are able to count
cases and in Denmark and Finland,

1536
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:45,460
which are,

1537
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,700
which are the two places where they've
actually done this research in the last

1538
00:39:48,701 --> 00:39:49,420
20 years,

1539
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:54,250
they've shown increasing rates of
schizophrenia between about 1995 and about

1540
00:39:54,251 --> 00:39:59,251
2010 and that goes side by side with
increasing rates of cannabis use in the

1541
00:39:59,321 --> 00:40:03,040
nineties so the people who are saying
that there's no evidence of population

1542
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:05,320
wide increases in
psychosis are just wrong.

1543
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,300
That's just possible that
there's other factors.

1544
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:10,790
Environmental factors is a
bunch of other different things.

1545
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,380
But let me,

1546
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,400
let me sit here on this.

1547
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,260
We absolutely don't have the evidence at
this point to say that cannabis use in

1548
00:40:17,261 --> 00:40:21,760
the u s is causing a population level
increase in psychosis and schizophrenia,

1549
00:40:21,761 --> 00:40:22,091
which are,

1550
00:40:22,091 --> 00:40:22,571
oh by the way,

1551
00:40:22,571 --> 00:40:24,850
those are sort of different
illnesses and we can,

1552
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,110
we can talk about that too.

1553
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:29,080
So we don't have the evidence to
say there's a definite increase.

1554
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:34,240
But what I'm saying is that what you have
been told that there is no increase in

1555
00:40:34,241 --> 00:40:36,850
schizophrenia or
psychosis rates in the US.

1556
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,110
That's,

1557
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,610
we don't know if that's true or not.

1558
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,330
We just don't.

1559
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:40,901
Me Ask you this,

1560
00:40:40,901 --> 00:40:44,050
there has been proven that there's
an increase in marijuana use.

1561
00:40:44,051 --> 00:40:44,650
Is that correct?

1562
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:44,980
Correct.

1563
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,660
Absolutely.

1564
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:45,870
How,

1565
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:46,271
when,

1566
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:48,310
when did the increase began and how,

1567
00:40:48,311 --> 00:40:48,670
what,

1568
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:48,940
how,

1569
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,350
what percentage increase?

1570
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,190
So there was a,

1571
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:56,190
there was an increase in the 90s and
increase in use and in potency use sort of

1572
00:40:56,381 --> 00:41:01,381
bottomed out around 1991 and then there
was sort of a flat bottomed out me and

1573
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:06,420
it hasn't increased since 1950%
since [inaudible] 92 that's a lot.

1574
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,600
It's a lot.

1575
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,021
It wasn't,

1576
00:41:08,021 --> 00:41:10,690
you expect a corresponding
increase in schizophrenia.

1577
00:41:10,691 --> 00:41:11,880
If there was any sort of correlation,

1578
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:12,461
hold on,

1579
00:41:12,461 --> 00:41:12,970
let me just,

1580
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:13,660
let me walk you through.

1581
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,140
Okay.

1582
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:17,230
It bottomed out in the early
nineties increased again,

1583
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:21,850
increased in the 90s flattened out
between about 2000 2006 and since then has

1584
00:41:21,851 --> 00:41:22,600
been going up again,

1585
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,220
especially in let's say the last three,

1586
00:41:24,221 --> 00:41:25,054
four years.

1587
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,360
And the other thing is that potency
in the last 15 years has gone way up.

1588
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:29,860
I don't think anybody would dispute that,

1589
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,700
but okay.

1590
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:31,570
Has Schizophrenia,

1591
00:41:31,571 --> 00:41:31,890
Ghana.

1592
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,980
So what I'm saying to
you is we don't know,

1593
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,420
there is evidence,

1594
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,040
there is,

1595
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:40,310
there is now evidence on a population
level basis in those other countries that

1596
00:41:40,311 --> 00:41:43,010
schizophrenia and psychosis has gone up.

1597
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,070
And there's for the first time in 2017,

1598
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,470
there's data showing that
serious mental illness,

1599
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:53,090
which is not the same as psychosis or
schizophrenia in the u s doubled between

1600
00:41:53,091 --> 00:41:58,091
2008 and 2017 in the and the e in people
aged 18 to 25 and those are the people

1601
00:42:00,261 --> 00:42:01,610
who are most likely to be using.

1602
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:02,990
So for the first time,

1603
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,180
there's actually evidence of
what you're talking about,

1604
00:42:05,181 --> 00:42:08,030
which is a population wide increase.

1605
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:08,720
Now again,

1606
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,090
I'm not going to say I'm not going to,

1607
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,120
can I get you to clarify?

1608
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,590
It shouldn't say serious mental health.

1609
00:42:12,591 --> 00:42:14,270
So serious mental illness.

1610
00:42:14,271 --> 00:42:15,590
So this was defined.

1611
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:16,310
Uh,

1612
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:19,010
there's a study called the national
survey on drug use and health.

1613
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,000
It's done every year,

1614
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:21,350
cover 70,000 people,

1615
00:42:21,351 --> 00:42:22,490
federal government funds it,

1616
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,520
it's sort of the best data
source we have on all this stuff.

1617
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:26,750
Um,

1618
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:27,680
it showed that,

1619
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,620
and they're not counting cases either.

1620
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,160
No.

1621
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,570
Let me just be as clear as I can on this.

1622
00:42:32,571 --> 00:42:36,050
Nobody's counting schizophrenia and
cases on a national or even state level

1623
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:38,840
basis in the u s but you say to people,

1624
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:42,470
did you have depression so bad
that you couldn't get out of bed?

1625
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:43,460
Did you,

1626
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:43,671
you know,

1627
00:42:43,671 --> 00:42:46,010
were you hospitalized
this year for psycho,

1628
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:46,580
for,

1629
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,010
for any inpatient psychiatric reason?

1630
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:49,820
And,

1631
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:54,740
and if you look at those numbers in 2008,

1632
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:56,330
3.7%,

1633
00:42:56,331 --> 00:42:58,670
I remember maybe it's 3.8% of Americans,

1634
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:00,530
18 to 25 reported,

1635
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:01,610
uh,

1636
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:02,930
at least one symptom.

1637
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:08,140
So they were categorized as having serious
mental illness that year in 2017 that

1638
00:43:10,311 --> 00:43:13,100
number was 7.5% so that's a double.

1639
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:14,570
So again,

1640
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:18,950
I am not going to say that proves that
the increase in cannabis use has caused

1641
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:19,580
this,

1642
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,361
this population,

1643
00:43:20,361 --> 00:43:21,194
that's something phase.

1644
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:23,090
But something bad has happened.

1645
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:26,240
And if you look at kids 12 to 17,

1646
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:27,470
interestingly,

1647
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:29,240
they over that time period,

1648
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,060
didn't have a big increase
in cannabis use in general.

1649
00:43:32,061 --> 00:43:34,700
Teenagers are actually
are pretty healthy now.

1650
00:43:34,701 --> 00:43:39,140
Although jewel in vaping may be undoing
that and those kids didn't have a

1651
00:43:39,141 --> 00:43:41,690
population level increase
in serious mental illness.

1652
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,570
Can I stop

1653
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:44,340
you for a second there
because there's other factors.

1654
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,540
One of the big one is,

1655
00:43:45,541 --> 00:43:47,510
you've all know Herati has a great book,

1656
00:43:47,511 --> 00:43:49,440
a 21 lessons for the 21st century.

1657
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,340
I read that.

1658
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:50,950
It's great.

1659
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:51,480
And uh,

1660
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,880
one of the things they talk about
is the onset of social media.

1661
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,090
Uh,

1662
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,460
Jonathan Haidt talked
about that as well and,

1663
00:43:56,461 --> 00:43:56,641
uh,

1664
00:43:56,641 --> 00:43:58,410
that the onset of social media,

1665
00:43:58,411 --> 00:44:00,030
it was actually more hate and then,

1666
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:00,983
uh,

1667
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:02,700
Herati but the,

1668
00:44:02,701 --> 00:44:03,000
uh,

1669
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,890
Jonathan Haidt talks about
it with young people.

1670
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:05,640
Yeah.

1671
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,990
I think coddling of the American mind.

1672
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:07,470
Yeah.

1673
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:11,640
I think that social media and the
pressures of social media have led an

1674
00:44:11,641 --> 00:44:13,460
incredible amount of young people to,

1675
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:14,190
uh,

1676
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,870
serious mental distress and,

1677
00:44:15,871 --> 00:44:16,261
you know,

1678
00:44:16,261 --> 00:44:17,190
serious anxiety,

1679
00:44:17,191 --> 00:44:22,191
serious depression and suicide amongst
young girls has increased some 50%

1680
00:44:22,981 --> 00:44:23,814
according to hate.

1681
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,630
Um,

1682
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:27,300
over the period of 2007,

1683
00:44:27,301 --> 00:44:27,481
two,

1684
00:44:27,481 --> 00:44:28,420
I think 2000.

1685
00:44:28,421 --> 00:44:30,180
And whenever his book was written,

1686
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:30,750
uh,

1687
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:31,290
and I,

1688
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,010
they're directly

1689
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,580
correlating that to the
pressures of social media and to,

1690
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:35,971
you know,

1691
00:44:35,971 --> 00:44:39,000
anonymous online bullying and all these
different factors that are affecting

1692
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:39,400
kids.

1693
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:39,660
Yeah.

1694
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:44,660
So I think that that could be
considered a far more significant new,

1695
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:46,560
uh,

1696
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,410
form of,

1697
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:47,951
of,

1698
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:51,780
of distress to children and
young people than even marijuana.

1699
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:54,300
I think it does it twofold
because I think that,

1700
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:54,930
you know,

1701
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:56,850
what makes people really depressed,

1702
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,840
maybe more so than,

1703
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,381
than anxious,

1704
00:44:58,381 --> 00:45:02,770
but definitely both is that when you
compare yourself to someone else and you

1705
00:45:02,771 --> 00:45:02,950
know,

1706
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:03,720
people,

1707
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,140
you know,

1708
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,430
obviously that we've done that,

1709
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:05,911
you know,

1710
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:06,201
all,

1711
00:45:06,201 --> 00:45:07,290
all humans have done that,

1712
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:07,561
you know,

1713
00:45:07,561 --> 00:45:09,300
since since history began.

1714
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:12,270
But now everything is online.

1715
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,370
You can compare your
life to everyone and it,

1716
00:45:14,371 --> 00:45:15,660
people are doing all the time.

1717
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,920
And even worse than that,

1718
00:45:16,921 --> 00:45:18,360
and you know when we
should talk about this too,

1719
00:45:18,361 --> 00:45:20,700
is that the income gap is getting,

1720
00:45:20,701 --> 00:45:21,540
is getting water.

1721
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,460
So it's like people's lives,

1722
00:45:23,461 --> 00:45:24,840
not only are they getting,

1723
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:25,350
you know,

1724
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,210
better than than,

1725
00:45:26,211 --> 00:45:27,180
than other people's lives,

1726
00:45:27,181 --> 00:45:28,560
but it's what it now it's on,

1727
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:29,401
it's on display.

1728
00:45:29,401 --> 00:45:30,450
So everyone can see it.

1729
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:31,560
Whereas before,

1730
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:31,861
you know,

1731
00:45:31,861 --> 00:45:34,710
maybe you wouldn't have seen it
because it wasn't on social media,

1732
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,540
but now it's on social media.

1733
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:39,840
So you had this huge income gap that
just keeps getting bigger and bigger and

1734
00:45:39,841 --> 00:45:40,500
bigger.

1735
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,720
And then you have people going,

1736
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,030
going on social media and they're
comparing themselves and you're absolutely

1737
00:45:45,031 --> 00:45:45,271
right,

1738
00:45:45,271 --> 00:45:46,440
especially in that,

1739
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:49,830
in that age population mean
people under under the age of 30.

1740
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:50,400
You know,

1741
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,300
they're definitely,

1742
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:51,680
uh,

1743
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,020
you know,

1744
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,370
they're being bullied online.

1745
00:45:53,371 --> 00:45:55,080
Like I see it every day in my office.

1746
00:45:55,081 --> 00:45:58,620
Like literally every day people are
being bullied online and that's,

1747
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,011
you know,

1748
00:45:59,011 --> 00:46:02,070
something that I never had
to deal with growing up.

1749
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:02,910
Um,

1750
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:03,361
and you know,

1751
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:04,770
a lot of kids do have,

1752
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:05,191
do,

1753
00:46:05,191 --> 00:46:06,390
have to deal with that.

1754
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:08,000
Just one more note to on,

1755
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:08,731
on the,

1756
00:46:08,731 --> 00:46:09,050
uh,

1757
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:10,460
since Colorado has,

1758
00:46:10,461 --> 00:46:10,791
has,

1759
00:46:10,791 --> 00:46:12,030
has legalized cannabis,

1760
00:46:12,031 --> 00:46:12,900
is this important for,

1761
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:13,151
for,

1762
00:46:13,151 --> 00:46:13,621
for this,

1763
00:46:13,621 --> 00:46:13,890
uh,

1764
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:14,131
this,

1765
00:46:14,131 --> 00:46:15,330
this subject in this topic?

1766
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:16,470
Um,

1767
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:19,500
they've actually seen
marijuana rates decrease.

1768
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,630
So it's important for people to know that,

1769
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:22,200
you know,

1770
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:27,200
just be knowing use or overall use or I
use has gone up 10 years is flat overall

1771
00:46:29,371 --> 00:46:30,090
uses up.

1772
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:30,450
Okay.

1773
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:30,721
Yeah.

1774
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:33,850
I'm talking about teen years that that's
the category that we're talking about

1775
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:34,980
under under 30.

1776
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:35,461
Right.

1777
00:46:35,461 --> 00:46:36,181
So teen use,

1778
00:46:36,181 --> 00:46:36,391
you know,

1779
00:46:36,391 --> 00:46:38,550
would classify as part of that category.

1780
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:39,230
So,

1781
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:39,540
you know,

1782
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:44,040
in Colorado we have seen a
decrease because of the lack of,

1783
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:45,990
because it's not illegal,

1784
00:46:45,991 --> 00:46:47,760
it's not as exciting to them.

1785
00:46:47,761 --> 00:46:48,750
Part of it for sure.

1786
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:49,170
You know,

1787
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:49,920
and I mean,

1788
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,320
part of it like a one worry I had,

1789
00:46:52,321 --> 00:46:52,501
you know,

1790
00:46:52,501 --> 00:46:54,780
I haven't looked into the statistics yet.

1791
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:55,380
It was,

1792
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:55,681
you know,

1793
00:46:55,681 --> 00:46:56,160
when,

1794
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,870
when you're growing up and,

1795
00:46:57,871 --> 00:46:58,170
uh,

1796
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:59,100
when you're in high school,

1797
00:46:59,280 --> 00:46:59,521
you know,

1798
00:46:59,521 --> 00:47:02,340
if you want to be part of the cool crowd,

1799
00:47:02,341 --> 00:47:02,851
so to say,

1800
00:47:02,851 --> 00:47:06,630
what do you usually
drink or you smoke pot,

1801
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:07,020
you know,

1802
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:07,980
that's what some people do.

1803
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:08,970
Um,

1804
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:13,740
I hope that that doesn't change
because pot scene as medicine,

1805
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:14,550
I hope that,

1806
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:14,910
you know,

1807
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:15,640
people don't,

1808
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:20,640
you don't move on to or do something
you'll harsher because they don't see pot

1809
00:47:20,791 --> 00:47:21,111
as,

1810
00:47:21,111 --> 00:47:21,990
as cool anymore.

1811
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,630
My attached to it because it's legal.

1812
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,290
Yeah.

1813
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:26,400
I got to push back on it.

1814
00:47:26,401 --> 00:47:26,541
Okay,

1815
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:26,721
cool.

1816
00:47:26,721 --> 00:47:27,554
Thanks please.

1817
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,100
So everything you about
social media sound,

1818
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:32,320
you know it's sort of
intuitively sounds correct,

1819
00:47:32,321 --> 00:47:32,830
right?

1820
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:35,230
The problem is the data
doesn't support this at all.

1821
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:40,380
The data shows that teenagers another
12 to 17 those kids are healthier than

1822
00:47:42,101 --> 00:47:44,230
they were 10 or 20 or 30 years ago.

1823
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:45,280
They drink less,

1824
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:46,210
they smoke less,

1825
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:47,140
they have sex later,

1826
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,160
that fewer abortions,

1827
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:49,360
they are healthier.

1828
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:49,570
Okay.

1829
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:50,403
Okay.

1830
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:55,140
And their mental health doesn't seem to
have changed that much based on the Ns

1831
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:56,050
D'you h data.

1832
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:56,680
Okay.

1833
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:01,680
The data shows a big change in
kids 18 to 25 they go to college.

1834
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,290
Something goes wrong
for a lot of those kids,

1835
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:07,270
at least in the last few years now.

1836
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:09,580
But what do you mean when you're
talking about suicide rates?

1837
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,360
Suicide rates are there,

1838
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:16,090
especially with young girls who are
apparently more effected by social media.

1839
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:19,480
They have gone up significantly
since the rise of social media.

1840
00:48:19,481 --> 00:48:23,680
That is the big fan of people who are
most likely a second more so than cannabis

1841
00:48:23,681 --> 00:48:23,860
use.

1842
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:24,730
And then that's a fact.

1843
00:48:24,731 --> 00:48:24,940
So,

1844
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:25,420
so you're,

1845
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:26,620
so you're talking about a tiny,

1846
00:48:26,621 --> 00:48:27,920
tiny number of people who not only,

1847
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:28,300
no,

1848
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:29,440
it's not a tiny number,

1849
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:32,140
50% increase of people
that commit suicide.

1850
00:48:32,141 --> 00:48:34,960
There are young girls that people who
commit suicide in the United States are

1851
00:48:34,961 --> 00:48:35,910
middle aged white men.

1852
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,153
And that's,

1853
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:38,111
wait a minute,

1854
00:48:38,111 --> 00:48:41,350
you're discounting these young girls
that are committing suicide to fit your

1855
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:43,510
statistics or to fit your conclusions?

1856
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:43,751
No,

1857
00:48:43,751 --> 00:48:45,040
what I'm saying is that's a tiny,

1858
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:45,641
tiny number,

1859
00:48:45,641 --> 00:48:49,000
but it's a 50% increase
is not a tiny amount.

1860
00:48:49,001 --> 00:48:50,230
This is something that we can look up.

1861
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:50,381
Well,

1862
00:48:50,381 --> 00:48:52,090
let's find out what the numbers are.

1863
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:52,933
But because the,

1864
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:56,050
when Jonathan Haidt was on the
podcast and you discussed it,

1865
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:56,471
I mean,

1866
00:48:56,471 --> 00:49:00,610
he showed this chart and it's an alarming
increase directly correlating with the

1867
00:49:00,611 --> 00:49:02,230
increasing use of social media.

1868
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,273
Sure.

1869
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:04,540
I am probably,

1870
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,160
I'm not such a pushback against that.

1871
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,660
So it seems to be a factor.

1872
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,833
What I'm,

1873
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:13,950
when I'm pushing back against is the idea
that kids 12 to 17 generally are less

1874
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,120
healthy than they were 10 or 20 years.

1875
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:17,710
And no one's saying they're less healthy.

1876
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,480
You just said they're more health.

1877
00:49:19,481 --> 00:49:19,721
Yeah.

1878
00:49:19,721 --> 00:49:20,740
I'm saying they're more healthy.

1879
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:21,041
Right,

1880
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:24,610
and what we're saying that Kid's health
has nothing to do with cardiovascular,

1881
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:26,380
mentally healthy.

1882
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,930
I mean they're less likely to use drugs.

1883
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:29,110
They're less likely to have sex with them,

1884
00:49:29,111 --> 00:49:30,580
more likely to commit suicide.

1885
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,260
That is a tiny,

1886
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:33,130
tiny number.

1887
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,000
What are you talking about?

1888
00:49:34,001 --> 00:49:35,350
If it's 50% increase,

1889
00:49:35,351 --> 00:49:36,550
that's a huge difference.

1890
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,820
We should look up the
number if we're gonna,

1891
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:39,650
if we're going to it.

1892
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:39,850
Look,

1893
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:42,880
Jonathan hates work is
like very well respected.

1894
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:43,290
What,

1895
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:46,690
what I'm saying to you is that there's
a clear increase in psychological

1896
00:49:46,691 --> 00:49:48,640
distress in kids and young adults,

1897
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:50,470
18 to 25 okay.

1898
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:55,120
There's a clear increase and those are
the people who are most likely to be

1899
00:49:55,121 --> 00:49:55,954
using cannabis,

1900
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:58,600
people that are most likely
on social media as well,

1901
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:00,660
and that's a stressful
period of your life.

1902
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:05,290
How [inaudible] 17 you should live in
at home like 18 to 25 then you've got to

1903
00:50:05,291 --> 00:50:06,190
go to university.

1904
00:50:06,191 --> 00:50:07,830
You got to deal with all these core seed,

1905
00:50:07,831 --> 00:50:08,261
the wound.

1906
00:50:08,261 --> 00:50:08,901
You can see the,

1907
00:50:08,901 --> 00:50:11,410
and I've said it at the beginning of the
program that I think the marijuana with

1908
00:50:11,411 --> 00:50:14,680
some people is not beneficial
and in fact could be negative,

1909
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:19,950
but I don't understand why you're not
willing to admit that social media has a

1910
00:50:20,171 --> 00:50:24,970
significant and unprecedented impact
on young people that we've never seen

1911
00:50:24,971 --> 00:50:25,451
before.

1912
00:50:25,451 --> 00:50:26,510
I would totally agree with that,

1913
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:28,130
but I don't think that you can say

1914
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:31,730
based on the population level data
that the impact is all negative.

1915
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,630
It may be,

1916
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:32,990
listen,

1917
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:34,880
if maybe who is saying that
the impact is all negative.

1918
00:50:34,881 --> 00:50:35,431
What we're saying is,

1919
00:50:35,431 --> 00:50:37,700
is it a 50% increase in
suicide with young girls?

1920
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:37,910
Right,

1921
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:38,750
but that's huge.

1922
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:39,321
Let me hear it.

1923
00:50:39,321 --> 00:50:40,021
Let me give you an example.

1924
00:50:40,021 --> 00:50:43,730
When you were 15 or I was 15
maybe you got really drunk,

1925
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,061
right?

1926
00:50:44,061 --> 00:50:45,290
And wound up in a bathtub.

1927
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,700
Like maybe kids today are less likely to
do that because of social media because

1928
00:50:49,701 --> 00:50:52,010
they know it's going to
be on Instagram forever.

1929
00:50:52,011 --> 00:50:53,060
I don't think that's true.

1930
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,920
I don't think that's proven and announce.

1931
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:57,020
I don't think there's anything
that would point to that.

1932
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:57,800
Well,

1933
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,890
what I can tell you is
proven is that kids,

1934
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,750
today I'm talking about teens,

1935
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:08,020
12 to 17 have less psychological distress
by all these measures I'm talking

1936
00:51:08,511 --> 00:51:08,661
about.

1937
00:51:08,661 --> 00:51:11,870
Their actual behaviors are
better or a better or worse.

1938
00:51:11,871 --> 00:51:12,621
That's a moral judgment,

1939
00:51:12,621 --> 00:51:16,130
but they're healthier than they
were 10 or 20 or 30 years ago.

1940
00:51:16,131 --> 00:51:17,450
They're less likely to have sex.

1941
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,540
They're less when they're 14 which I
think most people say it's a good thing.

1942
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,610
They're less likely to be drinking.

1943
00:51:22,611 --> 00:51:23,900
They're less likely to be smoking.

1944
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:25,100
Those are good things.

1945
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:25,460
Well,

1946
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,200
less likely to

1947
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:26,741
be drinking,

1948
00:51:26,741 --> 00:51:27,790
less likely to be smoking,

1949
00:51:27,791 --> 00:51:32,290
less likely to have sex does not correlate
to positive mental outlook and less

1950
00:51:32,291 --> 00:51:33,080
suicide.

1951
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:33,470
Well,

1952
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:33,780
yes,

1953
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,190
there's,

1954
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:35,023
I agreed there.

1955
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:35,871
We look.

1956
00:51:35,871 --> 00:51:36,980
Let's look at the numbers,

1957
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,700
but depression and suicide are the
very difficult things to measure,

1958
00:51:40,701 --> 00:51:41,420
right?

1959
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:42,230
Depression,

1960
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:42,660
well,

1961
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:42,991
suicides,

1962
00:51:42,991 --> 00:51:43,671
actually suicides,

1963
00:51:43,671 --> 00:51:44,504
you're going to use it.

1964
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:45,471
It's a hard number.

1965
00:51:45,471 --> 00:51:47,300
Depression is a is look at this spike

1966
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:51,350
bottom numbers in females.

1967
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,030
I mean this is what I'm saying,

1968
00:51:53,031 --> 00:51:53,990
that death rate,

1969
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:54,471
first of all,

1970
00:51:54,471 --> 00:51:54,920
this is,

1971
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,030
this is okay.

1972
00:51:56,031 --> 00:52:01,031
The death rate for girls age 15
to 19 is four per 100,000 Joe,

1973
00:52:01,561 --> 00:52:03,590
it's a 40 it's at a 40 year high.

1974
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,220
Right.

1975
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,470
So I mean you,

1976
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,610
you'd be hard put to
say that's a huge spike.

1977
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:12,590
It was three per hundred thousand in
1975 and it's a little bit over four and

1978
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:14,240
2015 that's not,

1979
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:17,480
that's one case per 100,000 girls.

1980
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:19,601
Yeah.

1981
00:52:19,601 --> 00:52:20,380
I don't know what,

1982
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:21,670
I don't know what the actual facts are.

1983
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:22,690
I'm looking at this right now.

1984
00:52:22,691 --> 00:52:25,870
The suicide rates for teens 15 to 19
years off is this is something that we'd

1985
00:52:25,871 --> 00:52:27,480
have to study and to,

1986
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:27,700
uh,

1987
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:28,533
have this discussion.

1988
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:31,510
Giant spike for boys in the 1990s.

1989
00:52:31,511 --> 00:52:32,291
What the fuck is that?

1990
00:52:32,291 --> 00:52:32,561
About?

1991
00:52:32,561 --> 00:52:33,580
95 what

1992
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:34,620
surprise,

1993
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:36,330
if you put middle aged men on this chart,

1994
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,080
you'd have to,

1995
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,490
you'd have to blow out the ceiling.

1996
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:42,600
Like the suicide crisis is
unfortunately a crisis of age.

1997
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:43,620
Yeah.

1998
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:43,950
Okay.

1999
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:44,111
I,

2000
00:52:44,111 --> 00:52:45,130
I would agree with that.

2001
00:52:45,131 --> 00:52:49,060
I think we actually talked about that
yesterday with Andrew Yang that a suicide

2002
00:52:49,061 --> 00:52:53,200
amongst men in their 50s and then they
start to feel useless and especially if

2003
00:52:53,201 --> 00:52:54,040
they lose their jobs.

2004
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:54,850
Um,

2005
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:59,110
but what Jonathan Haidt is pointing to
is a direct correlation between social

2006
00:52:59,111 --> 00:52:59,831
media use,

2007
00:52:59,831 --> 00:53:02,200
depression and suicide
amongst young girls.

2008
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:02,830
Um,

2009
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:03,663
thank you for finding,

2010
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:04,500
what is it?

2011
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,291
This is the article.

2012
00:53:05,291 --> 00:53:08,170
It's from his suicide rate for teen girls.

2013
00:53:08,171 --> 00:53:10,930
The highest it's been in 40
years is social media to blame.

2014
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:11,450
Right?

2015
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:12,283
So,

2016
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:13,203
okay.

2017
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:14,820
Um,

2018
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:15,653
new data presented,

2019
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:16,150
uh,

2020
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:19,120
released Thursday by the Atlanta
based Centers for Disease Control and

2021
00:53:19,121 --> 00:53:23,740
prevention suicide rates amongst 15 to
19 year old girls doubled between 2007

2022
00:53:23,741 --> 00:53:26,070
and 2015 reaching a 40 year high.

2023
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,240
I would say that's significant.

2024
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:27,661
Again,

2025
00:53:27,661 --> 00:53:28,021
I would,

2026
00:53:28,021 --> 00:53:28,400
and,

2027
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,080
and it's obviously a terrible
thing when anybody commits suicide,

2028
00:53:31,081 --> 00:53:33,340
but we're talking about two per 100,000.

2029
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:35,300
It's five,

2030
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:36,450
well went from two to four.

2031
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:36,990
Okay.

2032
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:39,930
That means for every 100,000
American girls in 2015,

2033
00:53:39,931 --> 00:53:41,100
five committed suicide.

2034
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,200
That's not a very high number.

2035
00:53:43,201 --> 00:53:43,680
But I mean,

2036
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,490
that's also someone who's pushed to
the extreme of taking their life.

2037
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:52,530
How many girls are experiencing severe
depression but don't commit suicide.

2038
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:57,720
That's the real factor because this is
what hate directly connects to social

2039
00:53:57,721 --> 00:53:58,260
media.

2040
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:58,830
Again,

2041
00:53:58,830 --> 00:53:59,970
the 50% increase,

2042
00:53:59,971 --> 00:54:03,540
you're talking about a relatively small
number because not as many girls commit

2043
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:04,440
suicide as men,

2044
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,510
but still this could,

2045
00:54:06,511 --> 00:54:07,201
you're talking about,

2046
00:54:07,201 --> 00:54:10,590
you were talking about depression and
you were talking about these significant

2047
00:54:10,591 --> 00:54:12,150
factors that would lead people to be,

2048
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,860
to have poor mental health.

2049
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,220
This could be a huge factor in this.

2050
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:17,520
Right?

2051
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,450
And I think that too,

2052
00:54:18,451 --> 00:54:19,560
it leads people to,

2053
00:54:19,561 --> 00:54:19,831
you know,

2054
00:54:19,831 --> 00:54:22,590
suicidal ideations and
depression and anxiety.

2055
00:54:22,591 --> 00:54:22,830
Me,

2056
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:24,760
right here we're just looking at CSI,

2057
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:27,810
which is the worst possible,

2058
00:54:27,811 --> 00:54:31,740
which is very rare amongst
girls periods or not or less.

2059
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:33,210
Yes,

2060
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:33,460
men,

2061
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:35,940
men do commit suicide more than women do.

2062
00:54:35,941 --> 00:54:36,481
But you know,

2063
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:39,210
we really have to be
careful about that because,

2064
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:39,990
you know,

2065
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:40,420
again,

2066
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,060
suicide is the aim.

2067
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,220
That's the worst thing
that could possibly happen.

2068
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:45,420
So what about,

2069
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:45,991
you know,

2070
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:46,351
all,

2071
00:54:46,351 --> 00:54:46,861
all the,

2072
00:54:46,861 --> 00:54:47,160
uh,

2073
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,480
all the things leading up to it,

2074
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:48,841
you know,

2075
00:54:48,841 --> 00:54:49,980
are there people who are,

2076
00:54:49,981 --> 00:54:51,720
who don't commit suicide but you know,

2077
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:53,260
suffer from terrible depression,

2078
00:54:53,261 --> 00:54:56,670
suffer from terrible anxiety
software from terrible insomnia.

2079
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:57,090
You know,

2080
00:54:57,090 --> 00:55:00,060
those people are not
accounted for in that graph.

2081
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,260
I agree.

2082
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:06,240
And what I'm saying is that cannabis use
has spiked in the United States in the

2083
00:55:06,241 --> 00:55:07,470
last 15 years.

2084
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,680
And teens not withstanding,

2085
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:13,140
we've seen a large degradation in
a number of these social outcomes.

2086
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:17,790
And now just today we have a Jama
Psychiatry paper that looked at a bunch of

2087
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:22,791
other studies that said cannabis use in
teenagers is associated with depression,

2088
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:24,630
suicidal ideation,

2089
00:55:24,631 --> 00:55:28,890
and suicide attempts in people
once they get to 18 to 30.

2090
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:29,370
Okay.

2091
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:30,203
So again,

2092
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:31,620
maybe a factor.

2093
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:32,310
What's that?

2094
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:33,690
It could possibly be a factor,

2095
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:34,111
yes,

2096
00:55:34,111 --> 00:55:34,740
but it might,

2097
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:38,670
it might also be that these kids are
depressed because of social media and

2098
00:55:38,671 --> 00:55:39,660
they're using cannabis.

2099
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:42,820
They're depressed because their
friends died from opioid overdose.

2100
00:55:42,821 --> 00:55:43,740
There's a lot of potentials.

2101
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:47,040
We are conceding the fact that,

2102
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:47,311
you know,

2103
00:55:47,311 --> 00:55:48,270
you just said again,

2104
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,760
that study was done on adolescents.

2105
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:51,300
You know,

2106
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,330
Joe and I have both concede
it multiple times that,

2107
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:54,721
you know,

2108
00:55:54,721 --> 00:55:56,440
we do not think high cheat.

2109
00:55:56,441 --> 00:55:59,940
See Cannabis is good for
people in that age category.

2110
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:00,990
But you know,

2111
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:01,411
just,

2112
00:56:01,411 --> 00:56:01,620
uh,

2113
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:03,300
just to back up just a little bit again,

2114
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:03,870
you know,

2115
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:04,411
I don't,

2116
00:56:04,411 --> 00:56:05,640
like I said earlier that,

2117
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:05,940
you know,

2118
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,780
I don't prescribe Cisi generally to
anyone under the age of 25 and most other

2119
00:56:09,781 --> 00:56:10,770
doctors in Canada who don't.

2120
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:14,400
But I think that we should be
prescribing CBD to these kids.

2121
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:15,780
Like a lot of those kids,

2122
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:16,080
you know,

2123
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,270
who have suicidal ideations,

2124
00:56:18,271 --> 00:56:18,751
depression,

2125
00:56:18,751 --> 00:56:19,370
I mean,

2126
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:19,550
you know,

2127
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:21,120
you could never do a study on it,

2128
00:56:21,121 --> 00:56:21,750
but you know,

2129
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:24,310
how many of those kids
wouldn't have committed

2130
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:29,310
suicide or wouldn't be feeling this way
if they were using CBD because we know

2131
00:56:29,501 --> 00:56:30,340
Ssri,

2132
00:56:30,341 --> 00:56:31,900
selective Serotonin reuptake inhibitors,

2133
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:32,530
you know,

2134
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:35,770
which are the most commonly prescribed
a medication for depression and anxiety

2135
00:56:35,771 --> 00:56:36,280
even in,

2136
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:36,731
in a,

2137
00:56:36,731 --> 00:56:37,564
in adolescents.

2138
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:38,230
Um,

2139
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:42,970
we know that they can increase
suicidal ideations that's been shown.

2140
00:56:42,971 --> 00:56:43,271
I mean,

2141
00:56:43,271 --> 00:56:44,380
it's written right on,

2142
00:56:44,381 --> 00:56:45,400
right on the package.

2143
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:46,390
So again,

2144
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:49,090
like as a clinician you have to,

2145
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:49,540
you know,

2146
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:50,770
treat your patients.

2147
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:55,410
If you're just treating people with
something that's it's not effective or the

2148
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:56,081
there that has,

2149
00:56:56,081 --> 00:56:56,231
you know,

2150
00:56:56,231 --> 00:56:57,250
horrible side effects,

2151
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:59,740
you're going to look at
other alternative treatments.

2152
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,600
A lot of people have,

2153
00:57:01,601 --> 00:57:01,930
have,

2154
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:02,950
have shown our,

2155
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:06,760
sorry have had excellent results
with CBD in that age category.

2156
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:07,300
You know,

2157
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,630
I've had had it done in my
practice and lots of other,

2158
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:10,991
you know,

2159
00:57:10,991 --> 00:57:12,180
physicians have had it done in,

2160
00:57:12,181 --> 00:57:13,060
in their practice.

2161
00:57:13,061 --> 00:57:17,080
So it's really important that when we're
talking about teenagers and we were

2162
00:57:17,081 --> 00:57:18,310
talking about that study,

2163
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:23,140
you're talking about high
potency THC in adolescence.

2164
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:26,320
That's where Joe and I both can see that,

2165
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:26,890
you know,

2166
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:29,860
THC is not a good medicine.

2167
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:30,833
I

2168
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:33,120
look if Gw Pharma or somebody else can,

2169
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:37,770
can do a study with CBD and depression
or some other cannabinoids and non

2170
00:57:37,771 --> 00:57:40,500
intoxicating cannabinoid in depression
and get it approved for that,

2171
00:57:40,501 --> 00:57:41,250
that'd be great.

2172
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:42,083
We need,

2173
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:44,850
we need all the treatments
for depression and for,

2174
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,880
and boy do we need treatments
for psychosis that we can get.

2175
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:48,660
Um,

2176
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:51,810
I totally agree with it and I'm really
glad to hear you say you don't think that

2177
00:57:51,811 --> 00:57:55,170
adolescents should be using
high potency or any hard drugs,

2178
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:57,450
especially alcohol.

2179
00:57:57,570 --> 00:57:57,811
No.

2180
00:57:57,811 --> 00:57:58,081
And they,

2181
00:57:58,081 --> 00:58:02,230
and they should try this also stay
away from the other medications.

2182
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,780
I want to push back on this,

2183
00:58:03,781 --> 00:58:07,350
on the alcohol versus a cannabis for
teens thing and I know that this is a

2184
00:58:07,351 --> 00:58:12,351
common feeling among you among people
in Brooklyn and among people in La and

2185
00:58:12,481 --> 00:58:14,730
sort of right when I mean right thinking,

2186
00:58:14,731 --> 00:58:15,270
I mean,

2187
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:15,571
you know,

2188
00:58:15,571 --> 00:58:19,890
sort of the general center left to
left you everywhere is that cannabis is

2189
00:58:19,891 --> 00:58:21,330
better for teens than alcohol.

2190
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,920
I totally disagree with that.

2191
00:58:22,921 --> 00:58:25,110
Canvas alcohol would no one's saying that.

2192
00:58:25,111 --> 00:58:26,520
I'm just saying alcohol's bad too.

2193
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:27,780
Okay.

2194
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:28,500
Then we agree.

2195
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:28,890
But you know,

2196
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:30,840
I mean I think you may
have heard this right?

2197
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:30,961
Oh,

2198
00:58:30,961 --> 00:58:32,370
I'd rather have my kids smoking pot,

2199
00:58:32,371 --> 00:58:33,151
my 16 year olds.

2200
00:58:33,151 --> 00:58:34,560
I think that's crazy.

2201
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:34,821
You,

2202
00:58:34,821 --> 00:58:39,821
you have to really be
careful with anything that's
severely perturbs your sense

2203
00:58:41,041 --> 00:58:45,390
of reality when you're a young kid and
you're trying to form your vision of the

2204
00:58:45,391 --> 00:58:46,224
world.

2205
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:51,090
I think to unpack what we're saying here
is that there is an increase in mental

2206
00:58:51,091 --> 00:58:56,091
health disorders amongst young kids
that corresponds to the increased use of

2207
00:58:56,281 --> 00:59:00,330
social media and may correspond
to the use of cannabis,

2208
00:59:00,331 --> 00:59:05,331
but that's not necessarily proven what
we'd guarantee almost universally because

2209
00:59:05,771 --> 00:59:10,771
these kids are on social media and also
to think much more likely that they're

2210
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:14,280
on social media than use cannabis.

2211
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:15,930
I think a lot of them use cannabis.

2212
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:16,980
I don't think all of them,

2213
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:19,350
all of them are on social media.

2214
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:20,280
Absolutely.

2215
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:20,570
Yeah.

2216
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:20,750
I,

2217
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:21,583
I think that,

2218
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:22,130
you know,

2219
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:24,410
almost every single kid these days,

2220
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:28,340
these days has a cell phone and they
have some type of social media account.

2221
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:29,840
I'm worried about kids use it,

2222
00:59:29,841 --> 00:59:33,200
everything I'm worried
about them using value them.

2223
00:59:33,201 --> 00:59:34,540
I'm worried about the end user

2224
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:40,910
and using stimulants
or Adderall and PROZAC.

2225
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:41,550
I think,

2226
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:45,260
I think psychiatrists give out
add medicine much too frequently.

2227
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:47,090
100% agree.

2228
00:59:47,091 --> 00:59:51,980
And I think that it has a severe impact
on kids when they're trying to study for

2229
00:59:51,981 --> 00:59:52,491
tests,

2230
00:59:52,491 --> 00:59:54,680
when they're trying to take their sats,

2231
00:59:54,681 --> 00:59:56,060
when they're trying to
get into a good college.

2232
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:59,510
I know so many people
that are on that shit.

2233
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:00,800
I know so many people,

2234
01:00:00,801 --> 01:00:02,300
whether they're journalists,

2235
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:03,800
I know Comedians,

2236
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:06,380
I know a lot of fucking
people are on Adderall.

2237
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:07,403
Yes.

2238
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:10,370
And you need to develop that kind
of like toughness when you're young.

2239
01:00:10,371 --> 01:00:11,630
Like you shouldn't just be like,

2240
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:12,111
you know,

2241
01:00:12,111 --> 01:00:15,290
14 years old and then
you run into your first,

2242
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:15,660
uh,

2243
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:15,900
you know,

2244
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,790
bit of trouble in your life and then you,

2245
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:18,041
you,

2246
01:00:18,041 --> 01:00:19,280
you reach for a pill.

2247
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:20,480
That's terrible.

2248
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,040
That's a terrible coping,

2249
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:22,940
coping mechanism.

2250
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:23,480
So,

2251
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:23,751
you know,

2252
01:00:23,751 --> 01:00:25,960
when you teach that to kids at a,

2253
01:00:25,961 --> 01:00:26,810
at an early age,

2254
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:29,750
and when you tell them it's such
a terrible thing to tell someone,

2255
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:30,231
oh,

2256
01:00:30,231 --> 01:00:31,460
you're 14 years old,

2257
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,380
you have major depressive disorder,

2258
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:34,790
you're going to take this pill,

2259
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,140
you need it for the rest of your life.

2260
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:38,720
And that said to people all the time,

2261
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:39,770
oh,

2262
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:42,350
you have a bio chemical deficiency
and this is what you need.

2263
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,060
We need kids to be tougher.

2264
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:44,451
Right?

2265
01:00:44,451 --> 01:00:44,931
So you need,

2266
01:00:44,931 --> 01:00:46,640
you need them to build up some,

2267
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:48,510
some resiliency so that you know,

2268
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,120
when they do go through hard times,

2269
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:50,451
you know,

2270
01:00:50,451 --> 01:00:52,010
they have better coping mechanisms.

2271
01:00:52,011 --> 01:00:54,740
Like Joe Talks about diet
and exercise all the time.

2272
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:59,660
I talked about diet and exercise all
the time and that's Kinda how I got my

2273
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:01,520
start on on social media.

2274
01:01:01,521 --> 01:01:02,840
It is through diet and exercise.

2275
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:05,210
Exercise is a big one for young.

2276
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:07,970
I mean it was a gigantic
factor for me personally.

2277
01:01:07,971 --> 01:01:09,200
When I was 15 years old,

2278
01:01:09,201 --> 01:01:11,330
I really got into martial
arts and it changed my life,

2279
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:14,240
changed my life by
alleviating so much anxiety,

2280
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:15,440
giving me so much more relaxed.

2281
01:01:15,441 --> 01:01:18,560
My parents talk about it to
like there's to use theirs.

2282
01:01:18,561 --> 01:01:20,550
You before martial arts,

2283
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:20,890
since you,

2284
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:21,723
after martial arts.

2285
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,060
Relatively young kids.

2286
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:23,480
Yes.

2287
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,171
And so do I.

2288
01:01:24,171 --> 01:01:25,070
And boy,

2289
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:26,900
they love the devices.

2290
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:27,530
I mean,

2291
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:29,130
I mean we have to fight and we,

2292
01:01:29,131 --> 01:01:29,270
you know,

2293
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:29,750
our kids,

2294
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:29,901
the,

2295
01:01:29,901 --> 01:01:31,160
fortunately they're three
and six at this point.

2296
01:01:31,161 --> 01:01:33,860
They don't have their own iPad
or iPhone or any of that stuff,

2297
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:34,490
but,

2298
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:37,250
but you give it to them for five minutes.

2299
01:01:37,251 --> 01:01:38,120
It's like crack.

2300
01:01:38,121 --> 01:01:38,400
It's like,

2301
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:38,640
yes,

2302
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,680
you gotta tear down to their hand.

2303
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:40,011
Oh yeah,

2304
01:01:40,011 --> 01:01:40,250
my,

2305
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:43,190
my kid will just turn their shoulder
when I try to get the iPad from her.

2306
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:43,770
They were like,

2307
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:43,911
no,

2308
01:01:43,911 --> 01:01:44,021
no,

2309
01:01:44,021 --> 01:01:44,121
no.

2310
01:01:44,121 --> 01:01:44,481
One more.

2311
01:01:44,481 --> 01:01:45,314
One more.

2312
01:01:45,590 --> 01:01:46,221
It's crazy.

2313
01:01:46,221 --> 01:01:46,731
It's a little,

2314
01:01:46,731 --> 01:01:49,370
it made it very fun and exciting for them.

2315
01:01:49,371 --> 01:01:49,671
You know,

2316
01:01:49,671 --> 01:01:50,450
and look,

2317
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:51,980
it's not entirely negative.

2318
01:01:51,981 --> 01:01:52,761
Like we have this,

2319
01:01:52,761 --> 01:01:53,594
uh,

2320
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:57,800
this TV set up with this dance game
that they play and they're sweating and

2321
01:01:57,801 --> 01:02:00,260
dancing and after it's over
the giggling and laughing,

2322
01:02:00,261 --> 01:02:02,810
it's a massive alleviate or of,

2323
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:07,520
of physical stress because
it's like they're constantly
got to follow this thing

2324
01:02:07,521 --> 01:02:07,810
and it's,

2325
01:02:07,810 --> 01:02:09,170
it's an exercise routine.

2326
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:09,741
I mean,

2327
01:02:09,741 --> 01:02:10,281
they're really,

2328
01:02:10,281 --> 01:02:11,270
their cardio there,

2329
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:15,830
their cardiovascular rate gets up
and they really feel good afterwards.

2330
01:02:15,831 --> 01:02:18,230
So it's not entirely negative,

2331
01:02:18,231 --> 01:02:19,070
but it's mostly,

2332
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:19,951
yes.

2333
01:02:19,951 --> 01:02:20,410
Yeah,

2334
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:20,770
yeah.

2335
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:21,960
If you have like a,

2336
01:02:21,961 --> 01:02:22,290
I dunno,

2337
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:24,180
is that Nintendo we are or whatever it is.

2338
01:02:24,181 --> 01:02:24,331
Yeah.

2339
01:02:24,331 --> 01:02:29,331
You can do this little thing that scans
it or you actually can use your phone

2340
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:31,650
and if you hold a phone,

2341
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,000
like I'll give them my phone.

2342
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:36,060
My wife will give the
other one the her phone.

2343
01:02:36,061 --> 01:02:38,930
And like the phone
shows how you're moving.

2344
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,073
It's very weird.

2345
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:44,970
So like mimic this thing that the
person on the screen is doing.

2346
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:48,060
But that's one thing that could,

2347
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,160
could be considered positive.

2348
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:55,170
I think for the most part the real issue
is social pressure and anxiety that

2349
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:58,040
comes from kids talking shit
about each other and they,

2350
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,490
they push buttons,

2351
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:02,730
they push buttons on each other because
they know that they can like this.

2352
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:06,030
They don't understand
the consequences it has.

2353
01:03:06,031 --> 01:03:08,580
But you would get free
from it when you went home.

2354
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:10,410
You're not free from it ever.

2355
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:12,990
Now these kids are waking up in the
middle of the night and checking their

2356
01:03:12,991 --> 01:03:14,460
Twitter account and find it.

2357
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:15,900
Their friends are talking shit about them,

2358
01:03:15,901 --> 01:03:17,550
whether it's on Facebook or whatever.

2359
01:03:17,551 --> 01:03:18,570
And this girl from school,

2360
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:21,330
that fucking bitch and she
commented on my youtube video,

2361
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:22,950
this is what they're dealing with.

2362
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:23,491
You know,

2363
01:03:23,491 --> 01:03:24,900
look at her with her fat face,

2364
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:25,561
lol.

2365
01:03:25,561 --> 01:03:27,360
And then those little 12 year olds like,

2366
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:29,160
oh that is,

2367
01:03:29,161 --> 01:03:30,420
that's a severe,

2368
01:03:30,421 --> 01:03:33,570
severe factor that no one had to consider

2369
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:34,020
before.

2370
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:34,150
Yeah.

2371
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:36,370
And it makes you almost not
want to go to school like this.

2372
01:03:36,371 --> 01:03:39,340
Kids who don't go to school because of
that cause they don't want to have to

2373
01:03:39,341 --> 01:03:40,174
deal with,

2374
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:40,481
you know,

2375
01:03:40,481 --> 01:03:41,320
someone said some,

2376
01:03:41,321 --> 01:03:42,970
I see it in my office all the time.

2377
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:45,790
Someone said something to them
last night on social media,

2378
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:48,940
so I didn't go to school today because
they don't want to have to face that.

2379
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,560
Like that's something that you know,

2380
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:53,620
my generation never ever had to face.

2381
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:54,341
But I do.

2382
01:03:54,341 --> 01:03:54,971
I mean I do.

2383
01:03:54,971 --> 01:03:57,790
I think we're a little bit
off topic here in terms of,

2384
01:03:57,791 --> 01:03:59,270
so we're talking about
depression and anxiety.

2385
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:00,720
We're talking about a factor.

2386
01:04:00,730 --> 01:04:01,110
Sure.

2387
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:03,730
Could be considered as big if not bigger.

2388
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:04,770
Social media does not,

2389
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:06,340
was people that get psychotic.

2390
01:04:06,970 --> 01:04:08,230
I don't know about that.

2391
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:09,130
Well I don't listen.

2392
01:04:09,131 --> 01:04:10,510
This is why I don't know about that.

2393
01:04:10,511 --> 01:04:12,010
Severe anxiety,

2394
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,060
lack of sleep,

2395
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:14,343
depression,

2396
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:15,580
absolutely

2397
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:19,260
correlated with altercations
on social media.

2398
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:20,370
Sure.

2399
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:22,760
But social interactions that are severely,

2400
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,300
they're correlated with
poor mental health.

2401
01:04:25,301 --> 01:04:29,770
The good news is the brain is a relatively
strong and power for some people.

2402
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:31,270
But if you look at sort of,

2403
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:32,770
it's not for everybody.

2404
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:37,030
Some people that are in a really
bad situation that of psychosis.

2405
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:37,490
Okay.

2406
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:37,830
Okay.

2407
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:38,081
Again,

2408
01:04:38,081 --> 01:04:39,940
it's less than 1% for schizophrenia,

2409
01:04:39,941 --> 01:04:41,800
which is the most severe
version you had sort of,

2410
01:04:41,801 --> 01:04:42,970
you had bipolar disorder,

2411
01:04:42,971 --> 01:04:43,511
psychosis,

2412
01:04:43,511 --> 01:04:44,620
depressive psychosis,

2413
01:04:44,621 --> 01:04:45,580
other kinds of psychosis.

2414
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:50,880
Maybe you get to about three to 4% of
the population is going to be diagnosed

2415
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:54,340
clinically with one of these illnesses
over the course of their life.

2416
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:54,900
So,

2417
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:55,361
so okay,

2418
01:04:55,361 --> 01:04:56,030
on the one hand that's a,

2419
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:56,920
that's a lot of people.

2420
01:04:56,921 --> 01:04:57,521
On the other hand,

2421
01:04:57,521 --> 01:04:59,560
most people are not
going to get psychotic.

2422
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,810
And most of the time if they do,

2423
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:04,660
there's either a genetic component
that's obvious cause psychosis and

2424
01:05:04,661 --> 01:05:09,160
schizophrenia often do run in families
or there's an environmental component

2425
01:05:09,161 --> 01:05:09,550
that's,

2426
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:10,780
that's pretty obvious.

2427
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:12,070
I mean people can get psychotic,

2428
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:13,380
they can get a brain tumor,

2429
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,410
can make them psychotic,

2430
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:14,920
they can,

2431
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:15,211
you know,

2432
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:15,911
it late in life,

2433
01:05:15,911 --> 01:05:17,650
they can get dementia
that makes psychotic.

2434
01:05:17,651 --> 01:05:19,570
There's oftentimes a pretty clear,

2435
01:05:19,830 --> 01:05:20,051
uh,

2436
01:05:20,051 --> 01:05:21,220
organic cause.

2437
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:21,760
Okay.

2438
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:22,810
So when we're talking so,

2439
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:27,990
so the brain is a relatively strong and
healthy Oregon and it takes a lot to

2440
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:29,500
break it.

2441
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:30,400
And that's why,

2442
01:05:30,590 --> 01:05:32,170
I mean that's a bold state.

2443
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,310
It is a bold statement,

2444
01:05:33,311 --> 01:05:34,300
but I would not,

2445
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,430
I would not agree with that at all really.

2446
01:05:36,431 --> 01:05:37,270
You know?

2447
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:38,080
Okay.

2448
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,600
I mean I'm not saying that
people don't get depressed,

2449
01:05:40,601 --> 01:05:41,710
takes a lot to break.

2450
01:05:41,711 --> 01:05:42,491
People are depressed.

2451
01:05:42,491 --> 01:05:43,324
All loans.

2452
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:48,730
I'm talking about the title that that
fucking antipsychotic medication was the

2453
01:05:48,731 --> 01:05:50,240
number one prescribed medication.

2454
01:05:50,241 --> 01:05:50,891
It's crazy.

2455
01:05:50,891 --> 01:05:51,970
Like people say to me,

2456
01:05:51,971 --> 01:05:52,420
you know,

2457
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:53,051
people used to say,

2458
01:05:53,051 --> 01:05:53,400
hold on,

2459
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,640
I'm on antidepressants,

2460
01:05:54,641 --> 01:05:55,061
I'm on,

2461
01:05:55,061 --> 01:05:59,020
I'm on antianxiety medication now people
like I hear them at parties and stuff

2462
01:05:59,021 --> 01:05:59,411
saying like,

2463
01:05:59,411 --> 01:06:00,340
oh I'm on Seroquel.

2464
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:01,130
I'm just thinking like,

2465
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:03,860
well that person just tell a bunch
of people that like throw on an anti

2466
01:06:03,861 --> 01:06:04,694
psychotic.

2467
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:05,310
It's crazy.

2468
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:07,920
It's weird that people don't know
that Sarah Cohen at or below fire

2469
01:06:07,921 --> 01:06:08,680
anti-psychotics.

2470
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:08,861
Right.

2471
01:06:08,861 --> 01:06:12,290
Cause they've been sort of marketed as
outside the class when in reality they're

2472
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:13,030
part of the class.

2473
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:14,710
But I got to push back
on you a little bit.

2474
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:17,140
Sales numbers for those drugs.

2475
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:18,220
Those are expensive drugs.

2476
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,320
They're not the most prescribed
drugs in the country.

2477
01:06:20,321 --> 01:06:21,100
Hold on.

2478
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:24,370
Abilify was the most prescribed
drug in the United States.

2479
01:06:24,371 --> 01:06:25,204
Should look that up.

2480
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:26,680
We have looked that up.

2481
01:06:26,681 --> 01:06:28,930
We've talked about it on the
podcast because it's insane.

2482
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:29,740
That is insane.

2483
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:30,770
And we do go to,

2484
01:06:30,771 --> 01:06:31,810
and this is a good time to,

2485
01:06:31,811 --> 01:06:34,520
to talk a little bit
about genetics after we,

2486
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:34,720
we,

2487
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:38,800
we kind of look at this cause we can
tease out a few things by looking at

2488
01:06:38,801 --> 01:06:39,620
genetics.

2489
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:44,620
Anti-Psychotic Abilify is the biggest
selling drug us to be a top seller drug

2490
01:06:44,771 --> 01:06:46,810
has to be expensive and also widely use.

2491
01:06:46,811 --> 01:06:47,950
Abilify is both.

2492
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:51,100
It's the 14th most prescribed
brand name medication,

2493
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:53,890
so it's 40 stuff but fucking that's crazy.

2494
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,320
All the people with actual diseases.

2495
01:06:56,321 --> 01:07:00,880
This is a 14th most prescribed brand name
medication at retails for about $30 a

2496
01:07:00,881 --> 01:07:01,191
pill.

2497
01:07:01,191 --> 01:07:01,720
Well doctor,

2498
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:04,570
I mean doctor can probably tell you
this is getting prescribed as an ant on

2499
01:07:04,571 --> 01:07:05,381
antidepressant.

2500
01:07:05,381 --> 01:07:05,981
Fulsome people.

2501
01:07:05,981 --> 01:07:09,370
What that means though too is
that equal are struggling man.

2502
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:09,790
Like,

2503
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:12,850
like life is hard for a lot of people.

2504
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:14,230
Like very hard,

2505
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:14,720
Alex.

2506
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:15,730
I very difficult.

2507
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:16,390
Okay,

2508
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:21,390
so a lot of people need
something sometimes at the
end of the day or during the

2509
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:23,800
day to help them get through the day.

2510
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,060
Cannabis,

2511
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:25,391
you know,

2512
01:07:25,391 --> 01:07:30,391
especially if the CBD component and also
the THC component when used properly is

2513
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:31,960
okay.

2514
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,570
Like I tell people all the time I've made,

2515
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:36,580
I've made social media
posts about it that like,

2516
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:36,911
you know,

2517
01:07:36,911 --> 01:07:40,720
if you need to use a little
bit of cannabis at the end
of the day just to help

2518
01:07:40,721 --> 01:07:41,350
you sleep,

2519
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:41,591
man,

2520
01:07:41,591 --> 01:07:44,280
you're doing great and you're
staying away from drugs and like,

2521
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:45,160
you know,

2522
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,030
prostitution,

2523
01:07:46,031 --> 01:07:46,540
gambling,

2524
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:48,250
all these other brutal habits.

2525
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:53,950
If you're doing all that,

2526
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:55,090
they're like you're doing,

2527
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:56,440
you're doing pretty good overall.

2528
01:07:56,441 --> 01:07:56,681
Right?

2529
01:07:56,681 --> 01:07:58,150
So gambling's not bad bro.

2530
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,113
A little bit again,

2531
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:02,340
what a bet on some fights you go.

2532
01:08:02,341 --> 01:08:03,520
It's absolutely,

2533
01:08:03,521 --> 01:08:03,971
by the way,

2534
01:08:03,971 --> 01:08:06,080
I think giving people
handheld devices that,

2535
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:07,870
that are inherently addictive,

2536
01:08:07,871 --> 01:08:12,080
where they can bet on sports every
15 seconds is a super bad idea.

2537
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:13,440
I hundred percent agree.

2538
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,150
Can talk about that too liquid.

2539
01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:15,501
You know,

2540
01:08:15,501 --> 01:08:16,060
it's one thing

2541
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:18,440
it's benefited me with social
media is my eyesight is going,

2542
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:19,530
the god of the older,

2543
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:21,500
I can't even read my Twitter feed.

2544
01:08:21,501 --> 01:08:23,750
I have fuck these people read it.

2545
01:08:23,751 --> 01:08:24,800
If I don't put my glasses,

2546
01:08:24,801 --> 01:08:25,970
I don't know what the fuck they're saying.

2547
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:26,751
Oh my God,

2548
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,241
it's so,

2549
01:08:27,241 --> 01:08:27,710
so,

2550
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:28,543
so good.

2551
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,200
People don't get depressed and anxious.

2552
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:34,340
I'm swinging to say this
is a different thing.

2553
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:35,270
Okay.

2554
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:35,601
Okay.

2555
01:08:35,601 --> 01:08:36,440
I think we're,

2556
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:36,790
we're,

2557
01:08:36,790 --> 01:08:37,880
we are dope though.

2558
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:39,830
Discussing overall mental health.

2559
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:40,550
I mean,

2560
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:40,980
I'll look,

2561
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:44,360
I'm saying this because I really think
that this is something that I've,

2562
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:47,270
I've made a big turn
over the last few years,

2563
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:47,540
uh,

2564
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:50,440
with myself that I don't
quick bathroom break gone.

2565
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:52,880
I don't think marijuana is a safe,

2566
01:08:52,881 --> 01:08:53,780
as I used to think it is.

2567
01:08:53,781 --> 01:08:54,920
I used to think it was benign.

2568
01:08:54,921 --> 01:08:56,450
I really used to think
there was no big deal.

2569
01:08:56,451 --> 01:09:00,920
But I have a friend that I discussed
the other day who was a really confident

2570
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:02,570
fucking muscular,

2571
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:07,070
handsome man that never did anything
and he took a marijuana edible to go to

2572
01:09:07,071 --> 01:09:07,490
sleep.

2573
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:09,170
And for two weeks this guy was,

2574
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:10,190
this is a different guy.

2575
01:09:10,191 --> 01:09:11,090
Not that I was talking to,

2576
01:09:11,091 --> 01:09:12,110
not not Rafi,

2577
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:12,351
no,

2578
01:09:12,351 --> 01:09:13,184
a different guy.

2579
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:16,730
He took it and he experienced
suicidal thoughts and all these.

2580
01:09:16,930 --> 01:09:19,040
He had like severe consequences.

2581
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:22,010
I think that the human beings,

2582
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:27,250
we vary so much biologically that to
just make this overall blanket statement,

2583
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:30,880
what's good for you is good for me
is irresponsible and I've been in a

2584
01:09:30,881 --> 01:09:33,320
responsible saying that
well for one reason.

2585
01:09:33,321 --> 01:09:34,101
It's interesting,

2586
01:09:34,101 --> 01:09:38,180
one reason I think that alcohol is so
widely accepted despite all the problems

2587
01:09:38,181 --> 01:09:38,721
it causes,

2588
01:09:38,721 --> 01:09:41,330
and again alcohol can
certainly cause problems,

2589
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:45,350
is that alcohol affects most
people pretty much the same way.

2590
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:46,190
You know if,

2591
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:49,820
and you sorta know if what somebody
looks like when they have one drink,

2592
01:09:49,821 --> 01:09:50,840
when they have five drinks,

2593
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:54,480
you've got some trends that I've got
some friends that get those juror belies

2594
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:56,180
you ever see when people get sharp guys,

2595
01:09:56,570 --> 01:09:57,500
they're just gone.

2596
01:09:58,350 --> 01:09:59,630
They start talking crazy,

2597
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,830
but you sort of know that and you sort
of know how long it's going to take to

2598
01:10:03,831 --> 01:10:05,140
clear your body and you,

2599
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:05,660
yes,

2600
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,550
cannabis is so different.

2601
01:10:07,551 --> 01:10:11,150
It's really complicated drug and it does
affect different people in different

2602
01:10:11,151 --> 01:10:11,720
ways.

2603
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:14,360
And also the tolerance
has changed radically.

2604
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:15,723
So you know,

2605
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:16,341
people say,

2606
01:10:16,341 --> 01:10:18,350
well two and a half milligrams of Thc,

2607
01:10:18,351 --> 01:10:18,891
you vape it.

2608
01:10:18,891 --> 01:10:21,770
That's like one drink for somebody
who you know who doesn't use.

2609
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:23,110
But then if you're on,

2610
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,680
if you're a tolerant user,

2611
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:26,870
you can use 200 milligrams in a day.

2612
01:10:26,871 --> 01:10:28,160
That's 80 drinks.

2613
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:28,460
Yeah,

2614
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:30,050
it's a weird drug.

2615
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:31,720
And then there's the issue of eating it.

2616
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:32,991
When you eat it,

2617
01:10:32,991 --> 01:10:36,410
your body produces something
called 11 hydroxy metabolite.

2618
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,470
It's a far more psychoactive.

2619
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,370
You were all along for the
ride when that happens.

2620
01:10:40,371 --> 01:10:41,660
Yes you are.

2621
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:42,081
Yes.

2622
01:10:42,081 --> 01:10:44,270
And it can take days for it
to get out of your system.

2623
01:10:44,271 --> 01:10:47,630
I know many people have eaten marijuana
edibles and then they call me up the

2624
01:10:47,631 --> 01:10:48,111
next day like,

2625
01:10:48,111 --> 01:10:48,321
dude,

2626
01:10:48,321 --> 01:10:48,950
I'm still hot.

2627
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:49,783
Yeah,

2628
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:50,321
it's true.

2629
01:10:50,321 --> 01:10:50,720
So,

2630
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:51,410
so,

2631
01:10:51,410 --> 01:10:52,310
so I think,

2632
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:56,540
I think the legalization community
has sort of said for years like,

2633
01:10:56,570 --> 01:10:56,721
oh,

2634
01:10:56,721 --> 01:10:58,700
there's basically no downsides to this.

2635
01:10:58,710 --> 01:10:59,690
There's only upsides.

2636
01:10:59,691 --> 01:11:01,460
The cops will bus smokers,

2637
01:11:01,610 --> 01:11:02,780
there'll be tax revenue.

2638
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,430
All of these people
have a way to get high.

2639
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:06,110
That's clearly safer than alcohol.

2640
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:08,330
And unfortunately that's just not true.

2641
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,380
I think you're right.

2642
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:12,290
And I think the issue that people,

2643
01:11:12,710 --> 01:11:14,010
from what I've read are

2644
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:17,520
having with your book are people that
are marijuana advocates and think that

2645
01:11:17,521 --> 01:11:22,410
your position is unbalanced and that
you've ignored the positive aspects of THC

2646
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:24,270
in terms of like what
he was talking about,

2647
01:11:24,271 --> 01:11:28,200
cognitive benefits for people with
psychotic episodes and that you are only

2648
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:29,390
focusing on the negative.

2649
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:33,930
I'll plead guilty to them cause I think
that for 20 years people have only heard

2650
01:11:33,931 --> 01:11:34,470
the positive.

2651
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:35,070
Right?

2652
01:11:35,070 --> 01:11:36,590
I think that's a,

2653
01:11:36,610 --> 01:11:37,560
I think that's also,

2654
01:11:37,561 --> 01:11:41,250
I'll plead guilty to up myself cause I
think that I've only been discussing the

2655
01:11:41,251 --> 01:11:45,060
positives and one of the things that
I've tried very hard to do and one of the

2656
01:11:45,061 --> 01:11:48,100
things I've learned how to do from
doing this podcast and experience and

2657
01:11:48,101 --> 01:11:50,640
criticism and communicating with a
bunch of different people with a lot of

2658
01:11:50,641 --> 01:11:54,660
different viewpoints is examine my
own positions and try to figure out,

2659
01:11:54,661 --> 01:11:59,250
am I coming at this from a truly balanced
position or am I trying to support a

2660
01:11:59,251 --> 01:12:01,230
conclusion that I started out with?

2661
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:02,400
And I'm trying to,

2662
01:12:02,430 --> 01:12:02,761
you know,

2663
01:12:02,761 --> 01:12:05,650
somehow or another backup my
own work or back up my own,

2664
01:12:05,651 --> 01:12:07,740
just my own statements and,

2665
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:08,081
and,

2666
01:12:08,081 --> 01:12:11,790
and sort of prop them up instead of
being really honest and objective.

2667
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:13,530
And it's very difficult to do.

2668
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:16,650
I wrote a book called Tell Your
children the truth about marijuana,

2669
01:12:16,651 --> 01:12:17,670
mental illness and violence.

2670
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,800
I don't think you can,

2671
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:25,130
you can think that that book is going
to be a compendium of the pros and cons

2672
01:12:25,381 --> 01:12:25,481
of,

2673
01:12:25,481 --> 01:12:25,690
well,

2674
01:12:25,690 --> 01:12:27,750
if you want to tell your
children the truth though,

2675
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:30,480
you really do want to tell
them the pros and cons.

2676
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:31,890
And then you did indicate,

2677
01:12:31,891 --> 01:12:32,341
Alex,

2678
01:12:32,341 --> 01:12:32,791
you said,

2679
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:33,000
you know,

2680
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,550
we should tell people
the truth in the book,

2681
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:35,821
right?

2682
01:12:35,821 --> 01:12:36,440
So,

2683
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:36,720
you know,

2684
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,970
I think that when you're
telling and you're saying that,

2685
01:12:38,971 --> 01:12:39,810
that you're telling the truth,

2686
01:12:39,811 --> 01:12:40,321
and Alex,

2687
01:12:40,321 --> 01:12:43,650
I'm agreeing with you that
you're telling part of the truth,

2688
01:12:43,651 --> 01:12:43,980
right?

2689
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:46,440
But part of the truth is,

2690
01:12:46,441 --> 01:12:46,621
you know,

2691
01:12:46,621 --> 01:12:49,290
a little bit deceiving and
deceptive in some ways,

2692
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:49,501
right?

2693
01:12:49,501 --> 01:12:52,290
You want to tell the whole truth
when you tell the whole truth,

2694
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:55,830
then you give the whole story and then
people can actually make you know,

2695
01:12:55,831 --> 01:12:58,110
a good informed decision based upon that.

2696
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:02,370
Like if people are going to
just read one part of the story,

2697
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:06,390
then of course they're going to make a
decision just based upon that one part.

2698
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:10,920
They're not going to make an informed
decision based upon all of the pots and

2699
01:13:10,921 --> 01:13:11,754
because of that,

2700
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:13,140
people are going to make you know,

2701
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:14,880
some very poor choices.

2702
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:16,260
I completely agree with that,

2703
01:13:16,261 --> 01:13:20,760
but to me the last 20 years have
been an exercise in the other side,

2704
01:13:20,761 --> 01:13:22,110
in the legalization side,

2705
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:23,340
doing a very,

2706
01:13:23,341 --> 01:13:26,820
very good job talking up its
arguments and essentially there's,

2707
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,320
there's almost nobody on the other side.

2708
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,680
There's this one guy who's
got on Jeff sessions,

2709
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:35,490
he had the fucking goddamn attorney
general telling people that good people

2710
01:13:35,491 --> 01:13:38,500
don't smoke marijuana and that's
literally a quote that says,

2711
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,990
and thank God that little more on,

2712
01:13:40,991 --> 01:13:41,780
it's not in an opposite,

2713
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:42,540
I'm more,

2714
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:43,320
but that's,

2715
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:44,640
that's a terrible thing to say.

2716
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:45,930
People don't smoke marijuana.

2717
01:13:45,931 --> 01:13:46,150
I,

2718
01:13:46,150 --> 01:13:48,470
there's a lot of wonderful
people who smoke marijuana.

2719
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:49,363
That's just not true.

2720
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:50,430
And by the way,

2721
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:52,020
I think this is a personal choice,

2722
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:52,381
okay?

2723
01:13:52,381 --> 01:13:54,250
Especially for adults and,

2724
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,460
and you can make bad personal choices.

2725
01:13:56,461 --> 01:13:56,990
You Go,

2726
01:13:56,990 --> 01:13:57,211
look,

2727
01:13:57,211 --> 01:13:57,961
I play cards.

2728
01:13:57,961 --> 01:13:59,010
I love to play poker.

2729
01:13:59,160 --> 01:13:59,371
Um,

2730
01:13:59,371 --> 01:14:00,720
said that on this trip to La,

2731
01:14:00,721 --> 01:14:02,070
I didn't get to go to a poker room,

2732
01:14:02,190 --> 01:14:05,400
but you can go into casino and you can
see people who've lost change your flight

2733
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:07,890
places close by.

2734
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:09,880
I don't incur Ari.

2735
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:12,010
You used to make a living
doing that and struggling with

2736
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:12,853
comedy.

2737
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:14,530
Don't encourage me,

2738
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:18,600
but you can go to a casino and see
people who've lost their houses.

2739
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,890
It doesn't mean that
gambling should be illegal.

2740
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:23,470
It also means that there's
less and more dangerous forms.

2741
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:26,740
That device in your hand where you can
bet on what the next pitch is going to

2742
01:14:26,741 --> 01:14:26,861
be.

2743
01:14:26,861 --> 01:14:27,800
If it's going to be a ball or strike.

2744
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:31,390
That's more dangerous than my having to
drive to the commerce and play there.

2745
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:36,720
And 100% or 98% THC that an 18 year old
vapes is a lot more dangerous than a 5%

2746
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:39,701
CBD,

2747
01:14:39,701 --> 01:14:44,701
15% THC product that doctor heart might
suggest is patient uses once a night to

2748
01:14:44,921 --> 01:14:45,680
go to sleep.

2749
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:46,150
But that,

2750
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:47,290
but that's the message that,

2751
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:47,570
you know,

2752
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:49,270
we should be putting out there,

2753
01:14:49,271 --> 01:14:49,481
right?

2754
01:14:49,481 --> 01:14:50,440
We shouldn't just be,

2755
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:50,830
you know,

2756
01:14:50,830 --> 01:14:52,720
focusing on one side of the story.

2757
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:53,554
Like that part,

2758
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:53,950
you know,

2759
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:56,500
should also be included
in the book and like,

2760
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:56,921
you know,

2761
01:14:56,921 --> 01:14:57,620
you're a book.

2762
01:14:57,620 --> 01:14:58,030
Um,

2763
01:14:58,030 --> 01:14:58,241
you know,

2764
01:14:58,241 --> 01:15:01,540
in some ways has made me
rethink the way that I write.

2765
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:01,991
You know,

2766
01:15:01,991 --> 01:15:03,280
because my first book,

2767
01:15:03,310 --> 01:15:03,490
uh,

2768
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:05,770
was coauthor with Jeremy
Costs and call friendly fire.

2769
01:15:06,010 --> 01:15:06,400
You know,

2770
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,430
my second book that I'm writing
now is called cannabis for PTG.

2771
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:13,690
So is how to transform posttraumatic
stress into posttraumatic growth.

2772
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:14,231
Right?

2773
01:15:14,231 --> 01:15:15,520
Because I feel that,

2774
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:15,970
you know,

2775
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:19,570
we all know examples of people that
have you encountered really difficult

2776
01:15:19,571 --> 01:15:22,150
obstacles in their life
and some people have,

2777
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:22,510
you know,

2778
01:15:22,510 --> 01:15:26,230
succumb to that stress and they've
gone down the wrong path kind of thing.

2779
01:15:26,231 --> 01:15:29,680
And then other people have used that
stress to their advantage and they've

2780
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:32,440
actually become better because of it.

2781
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:33,900
And you know,

2782
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:34,720
um,

2783
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:39,310
CBD and Thc can both help
facilitate that process.

2784
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:39,701
You know,

2785
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:41,620
when you're looking at
someone like a veteran,

2786
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:42,454
for example,

2787
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:46,630
you're the hallmark of someone with
whose PTSD is someone who doesn't leave

2788
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:48,910
their home and they can't sleep at night.

2789
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:51,430
So like when I see a vet in my office,

2790
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:54,700
a lot of the times they'll be leaving
their home like five to 10 days a month,

2791
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:55,331
right?

2792
01:15:55,331 --> 01:15:56,890
So when you give them CBD,

2793
01:15:56,891 --> 01:15:58,480
and this is really important
for people to understand,

2794
01:15:58,630 --> 01:16:01,900
CBD has been shown to
decrease learned fear.

2795
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:03,340
That's incredible,

2796
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:03,821
right?

2797
01:16:03,821 --> 01:16:04,420
So,

2798
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:04,840
um,

2799
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,940
if you can get people
outside of their home,

2800
01:16:06,941 --> 01:16:08,170
because I'm not talking about,

2801
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:08,711
again,

2802
01:16:08,711 --> 01:16:08,861
you know,

2803
01:16:08,861 --> 01:16:09,694
someone who's,

2804
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:10,320
you know,

2805
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,420
I'm too nervous to like go to,

2806
01:16:12,421 --> 01:16:12,610
uh,

2807
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:12,910
uh,

2808
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:13,260
you know,

2809
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:14,093
uh,

2810
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:15,850
the bar with like the friends
or something like that.

2811
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:17,050
I'm talking to people who were like,

2812
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:17,321
you know,

2813
01:16:17,321 --> 01:16:18,940
it was difficult for them
to go to the grocery store,

2814
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:20,320
just like pick up a few things.

2815
01:16:20,650 --> 01:16:21,483
So,

2816
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:21,881
you know,

2817
01:16:21,881 --> 01:16:24,820
those are the type of people that I
see in my practice of CBD is really

2818
01:16:24,821 --> 01:16:25,654
excellent for that.

2819
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:26,590
Then when you look at,

2820
01:16:26,610 --> 01:16:26,910
you know,

2821
01:16:26,910 --> 01:16:27,160
the,

2822
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,330
the nighttime component,

2823
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:29,130
um,

2824
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:29,710
you know,

2825
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:32,830
THC again is excellent
for reducing nightmares.

2826
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:36,820
That's been shown in studies and it was
even shown with one pharmaceutical drug

2827
01:16:36,821 --> 01:16:37,240
nabilone.

2828
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:37,510
Again,

2829
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:42,510
I don't really use nabilone very much
because it's only one cannabinoid and I do

2830
01:16:43,001 --> 01:16:43,461
believe in,

2831
01:16:43,461 --> 01:16:43,591
in,

2832
01:16:43,591 --> 01:16:46,600
in the entourage effect and
using all of the cannabinoids.

2833
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:47,950
So I don't use it that much.

2834
01:16:47,951 --> 01:16:49,450
But that shows that she,

2835
01:16:49,451 --> 01:16:51,580
she came reduced nightmares and you know,

2836
01:16:51,581 --> 01:16:52,310
if you have,

2837
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:52,630
you have,

2838
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:53,800
if you have PTSD,

2839
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:56,860
I mean if you talk to
someone who has PTSD,

2840
01:16:56,861 --> 01:16:57,640
and again this is,

2841
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:59,590
this comes from a
clinician's point of view,

2842
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:00,700
they will tell you,

2843
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,560
I will try anything.

2844
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,900
And that's the same way
when you get with like,

2845
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:05,913
you know,

2846
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:07,030
the parents of,

2847
01:17:07,031 --> 01:17:07,450
of,

2848
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:07,850
of,

2849
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:09,740
of kids who have seizures all day.

2850
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:10,340
Nobody

2851
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:12,070
wants to see that you like and like,

2852
01:17:12,071 --> 01:17:12,770
and like Alex,

2853
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:12,981
you know,

2854
01:17:12,981 --> 01:17:13,880
if your kids,

2855
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:14,150
you know,

2856
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:15,590
ever started getting,

2857
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:16,580
getting seizures,

2858
01:17:16,581 --> 01:17:17,150
which you know,

2859
01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:17,630
I hope,

2860
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:18,800
I hope they don't because it's,

2861
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:19,551
it's terrible.

2862
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:19,881
You know what,

2863
01:17:19,881 --> 01:17:20,930
what it can do to people.

2864
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:23,660
But if that ever happened,

2865
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:24,201
you know,

2866
01:17:24,201 --> 01:17:25,760
I would hope that you would consider,

2867
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:26,181
you know,

2868
01:17:26,181 --> 01:17:28,640
CBD as a potential treatment option.

2869
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:30,261
He's not against it.

2870
01:17:30,261 --> 01:17:32,040
I think we have to be really
clear as a distinction.

2871
01:17:32,041 --> 01:17:32,661
Like CBD,

2872
01:17:32,661 --> 01:17:34,270
you're not against you at all and I don't,

2873
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:35,390
I don't think anybody is.

2874
01:17:35,391 --> 01:17:39,020
I think no one really is arguing except
maybe the federal government in certain

2875
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:40,730
levels is arguing against CBD.

2876
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:43,250
That's probably some pushback
from the pharmaceutical industry.

2877
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:45,920
The reality is CBD is proven to be,

2878
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:48,170
at least as far as I've read,

2879
01:17:48,171 --> 01:17:51,920
very safe and very effective for
a bunch of different disorders,

2880
01:17:51,921 --> 01:17:55,400
especially those that are about
reducing and have something to do with

2881
01:17:55,401 --> 01:17:56,690
inflammation or seizures.

2882
01:17:56,690 --> 01:17:56,841
Yeah.

2883
01:17:56,841 --> 01:17:57,920
One of my good friends,

2884
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:01,910
his son has developed seizures
and CBD knocked it out,

2885
01:18:01,911 --> 01:18:02,660
just killed it,

2886
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:03,493
killed it on time.

2887
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:04,540
This is very recently,

2888
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:04,970
you know,

2889
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:05,830
you're somebody who's a,

2890
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,150
you know,

2891
01:18:06,150 --> 01:18:07,190
who's a cannabis user,

2892
01:18:07,191 --> 01:18:08,480
you obviously know a lot of users.

2893
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,520
Why do you think it is it people,

2894
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:11,030
you know,

2895
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:13,640
in legal states where they can
really express a preference,

2896
01:18:13,641 --> 01:18:14,660
they can go into a dispensary,

2897
01:18:14,661 --> 01:18:15,770
know exactly what they're buying.

2898
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:20,390
Why is it that they want such
high potency THC product?

2899
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:21,830
Because they get used to it.

2900
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:22,520
Um,

2901
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:22,930
you,

2902
01:18:22,930 --> 01:18:24,470
your tolerance develops,

2903
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:25,803
it builds up,

2904
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:26,300
you know,

2905
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:28,370
every year we do this
thing called sober October.

2906
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:28,521
Well,

2907
01:18:28,521 --> 01:18:30,140
we don't do any no drinking,

2908
01:18:30,141 --> 01:18:30,770
no,

2909
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:31,371
no pot.

2910
01:18:31,371 --> 01:18:33,470
And we do do some sort of crazy challenge,

2911
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:34,340
uh,

2912
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:35,930
me and three of my buddies and,

2913
01:18:35,931 --> 01:18:36,764
uh,

2914
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:38,120
when we do it,

2915
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:38,300
uh,

2916
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:38,810
what,

2917
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:41,840
it's very interesting how your
tolerance is radically reduced.

2918
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:42,560
Like,

2919
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,780
I'll smoke pot at the end
of that month and I'm like,

2920
01:18:44,781 --> 01:18:46,100
Holy Shit.

2921
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:46,671
Like,

2922
01:18:46,671 --> 01:18:49,340
I don't even know what I'm talking
about in the mid sentence and I'm just

2923
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:50,450
blitzkrieg.

2924
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:51,201
Whereas,

2925
01:18:51,201 --> 01:18:51,471
you know,

2926
01:18:51,471 --> 01:18:52,281
now like,

2927
01:18:52,281 --> 01:18:52,491
uh,

2928
01:18:52,491 --> 01:18:53,870
I smoked a little weed last night,

2929
01:18:53,871 --> 01:18:54,561
did some stand up,

2930
01:18:54,561 --> 01:18:55,311
had a great old time.

2931
01:18:55,311 --> 01:18:55,611
There was no,

2932
01:18:55,611 --> 01:18:56,720
no issues with it at all.

2933
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:57,830
But I'm used to it.

2934
01:18:57,950 --> 01:18:59,870
And if the weed that I smoked last night,

2935
01:18:59,910 --> 01:19:01,040
I assume you don't smoke.

2936
01:19:01,410 --> 01:19:02,150
I do not.

2937
01:19:02,150 --> 01:19:02,421
Okay.

2938
01:19:02,421 --> 01:19:05,390
If you and me were together last night
and I gave you a hit of my joint,

2939
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,400
you'd beat still there in the corner,

2940
01:19:07,401 --> 01:19:08,420
in the fetal position going,

2941
01:19:08,421 --> 01:19:10,100
what in the fuck is going on?

2942
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:12,470
Because the marijuana is
ridiculously powerful.

2943
01:19:12,471 --> 01:19:13,790
But once you're accustomed to it,

2944
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:14,900
once your body acclimates,

2945
01:19:14,901 --> 01:19:16,250
it's really not that big of a deal.

2946
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:17,480
The problem is,

2947
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:18,120
uh,

2948
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:18,420
you,

2949
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:22,100
you're dealing with a lot
of habitual daily users.

2950
01:19:22,101 --> 01:19:22,940
And for those people,

2951
01:19:22,941 --> 01:19:24,420
like my friend Joey Diaz,

2952
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:27,440
if there's a video of him
giving this a other comedian,

2953
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:27,880
uh,

2954
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:30,710
w how many milligrams of
those stars with death?

2955
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:31,843
Oh,

2956
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:33,870
like when we give Owen,

2957
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:34,680
what did he give all them?

2958
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:35,540
I think just one.

2959
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,850
He ruined his life would
have been about 200 to 250,

2960
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:41,500
two 54 and went out.

2961
01:19:41,501 --> 01:19:41,690
The,

2962
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:42,800
Joey made a video,

2963
01:19:42,801 --> 01:19:45,080
but the day it changed Owen's life,

2964
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,510
like literally fucked the guy's head up.

2965
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:49,640
Like he went outside and he vanished.

2966
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:50,553
He's gone.

2967
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:53,253
That's cannabis.

2968
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:53,650
Like,

2969
01:19:53,650 --> 01:19:54,483
oh,

2970
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:55,311
well I think,

2971
01:19:55,311 --> 01:19:57,140
I think there's a real
argument to be made.

2972
01:19:57,141 --> 01:19:58,130
It's particularly with him.

2973
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:01,190
Well it's like it was going
to make two points on that.

2974
01:20:01,191 --> 01:20:06,191
So you definitely came develop a tolerance
seal and I tell people all the time,

2975
01:20:06,321 --> 01:20:08,610
try and take at one three week break.

2976
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:09,300
Um,

2977
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:13,410
but the evidence does show that
if you stop for four weeks,

2978
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:17,520
generally all your sectors return and
will be like you've never used cannabis

2979
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:18,354
before.

2980
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:19,470
She saw it.

2981
01:20:19,470 --> 01:20:22,110
And that's even with
people who are really,

2982
01:20:22,111 --> 01:20:23,760
really heavy users.

2983
01:20:23,761 --> 01:20:25,440
I can go back and get the study.

2984
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:25,950
Um,

2985
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:27,450
but I mean these people are you using,

2986
01:20:27,451 --> 01:20:29,910
I'm pretty sure it was like
close like seven joints a day.

2987
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:33,040
Well really heavy users and snoop
Dogg's a good example of that.

2988
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:37,050
My friend Tony Hinchcliffe is good
buddies with snoop Dogg and he said Snoop

2989
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:40,740
Dogg just smokes all day and he just like,

2990
01:20:40,741 --> 01:20:42,640
he's always high and you know,

2991
01:20:42,641 --> 01:20:42,961
they're like,

2992
01:20:42,961 --> 01:20:44,070
well what do you do when you're not high?

2993
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:44,431
He's like,

2994
01:20:44,431 --> 01:20:45,264
what?

2995
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:46,081
He's like,

2996
01:20:46,081 --> 01:20:47,280
I'm never not high.

2997
01:20:47,290 --> 01:20:48,660
So everything he does,

2998
01:20:48,661 --> 01:20:49,920
he is high as fuck.

2999
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:51,000
Everything he does.

3000
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:51,721
Like for that guy,

3001
01:20:51,721 --> 01:20:52,800
it's not that big of a deal.

3002
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:54,720
And for the way he lives his life,

3003
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:56,490
like he's just a relaxed,

3004
01:20:56,510 --> 01:20:57,450
easy going guy.

3005
01:20:57,451 --> 01:20:58,290
It's no problem.

3006
01:20:58,291 --> 01:21:02,100
You can be high all day and live his
life and he's obviously wildly successful

3007
01:21:02,101 --> 01:21:02,940
with this strategy.

3008
01:21:03,010 --> 01:21:03,490
Yeah.

3009
01:21:03,490 --> 01:21:04,323
Worldly success.

3010
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:09,660
The second point I was gonna I was going
to make on that too though was there

3011
01:21:09,811 --> 01:21:13,790
does not appear to be any
tolerance at the CB two receptors.

3012
01:21:13,791 --> 01:21:16,530
So cheesy attaches to the
CB one receptor and that's,

3013
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:18,300
and that's where we know
we can get tolerance.

3014
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:18,660
You know,

3015
01:21:18,660 --> 01:21:19,493
some people,

3016
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:19,860
you know,

3017
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:20,161
they,

3018
01:21:20,161 --> 01:21:23,700
they have some pain that use some TFC and
sometimes they need a little bit more.

3019
01:21:23,701 --> 01:21:24,960
Same sometimes asleep,

3020
01:21:25,170 --> 01:21:25,381
you know,

3021
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:26,070
the use TC,

3022
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:28,980
it'll work and then we'll
stop working with CBD to,

3023
01:21:28,981 --> 01:21:30,060
we haven't seen that.

3024
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:31,830
Meaning like the people who,

3025
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:32,251
uh,

3026
01:21:32,251 --> 01:21:32,550
you know,

3027
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:33,060
get,

3028
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:34,140
get seizure control.

3029
01:21:34,410 --> 01:21:36,960
Generally they don't need
to increase the dose.

3030
01:21:36,961 --> 01:21:38,730
Like the girl I was talking about earlier,

3031
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:39,450
um,

3032
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:39,811
you know,

3033
01:21:39,811 --> 01:21:40,500
at first described,

3034
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:41,370
I think when she was 20,

3035
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:42,300
when she was about in 20,

3036
01:21:42,301 --> 01:21:43,320
she's 25 now.

3037
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:45,750
She's never increased her dose.

3038
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:45,961
I mean,

3039
01:21:45,961 --> 01:21:48,900
she's just used the same amount
to CBD for the last five years.

3040
01:21:48,910 --> 01:21:49,640
Medicine.

3041
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:49,940
Right.

3042
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:50,773
Like it works.

3043
01:21:51,670 --> 01:21:54,700
I think we should really
stop talking about CBD.

3044
01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:57,330
I just wanted to make a note on the,

3045
01:21:57,331 --> 01:21:57,690
uh,

3046
01:21:57,690 --> 01:21:59,550
on the tolerance of the CPU on,

3047
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:02,780
I just wanted to make a note that CBT
there doesn't appear to be tolerance.

3048
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,470
And so it's just,

3049
01:22:04,471 --> 01:22:06,630
there's just such a significant impact,

3050
01:22:06,710 --> 01:22:07,140
um,

3051
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:07,500
when,

3052
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:10,800
when it comes to especially edible THC,

3053
01:22:11,070 --> 01:22:11,520
uh,

3054
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,070
it's a,

3055
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:16,440
there's a significant impact on people's
state of mind and it's not always good.

3056
01:22:16,970 --> 01:22:17,970
That's just a fact.

3057
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:18,280
We,

3058
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:18,481
I mean,

3059
01:22:18,481 --> 01:22:19,370
we were talking about this when,

3060
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:20,640
when you were were out,

3061
01:22:20,641 --> 01:22:21,400
but you know,

3062
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:21,931
that's why I,

3063
01:22:21,931 --> 01:22:22,980
so I had an interview.

3064
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:26,530
I was that guy who was doing the
radio interview on the Slo from,

3065
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:30,120
from DC to New York last month.

3066
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:30,751
And,

3067
01:22:30,751 --> 01:22:31,050
uh,

3068
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:32,670
this woman came in and it was Baltimore.

3069
01:22:32,671 --> 01:22:36,300
She sat down next to me and I
finished the interview and she said,

3070
01:22:36,301 --> 01:22:37,500
she said I couldn't help overhearing.

3071
01:22:37,501 --> 01:22:37,741
I thought,

3072
01:22:37,741 --> 01:22:37,861
oh,

3073
01:22:37,861 --> 01:22:38,341
Jesus.

3074
01:22:38,341 --> 01:22:39,210
Like she's,

3075
01:22:39,290 --> 01:22:39,690
she's,

3076
01:22:39,690 --> 01:22:42,060
she's a pothead or she's just
annoyed that I was doing this.

3077
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:43,051
But no,

3078
01:22:43,051 --> 01:22:43,531
she said,

3079
01:22:43,531 --> 01:22:43,771
you know,

3080
01:22:43,771 --> 01:22:45,450
I was in Seattle last month.

3081
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:45,750
She's,

3082
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:47,340
this woman was in her early thirties.

3083
01:22:47,341 --> 01:22:48,174
She was a lawyer,

3084
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:49,140
uh,

3085
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:49,973
married.

3086
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:50,640
She said,

3087
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:52,500
and a friend of mine said to me,

3088
01:22:52,530 --> 01:22:53,160
let's,

3089
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:53,720
let's have,

3090
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:54,553
let's do an edible.

3091
01:22:54,710 --> 01:22:55,080
Uh,

3092
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:55,411
she said,

3093
01:22:55,411 --> 01:22:55,980
I took it,

3094
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:57,240
we bought a small dose.

3095
01:22:57,270 --> 01:22:58,440
We asked them for a small dose.

3096
01:22:58,470 --> 01:22:59,490
I took half of it.

3097
01:22:59,491 --> 01:23:01,950
So I think she took like
five milligrams if that.

3098
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:03,390
And she said,

3099
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:04,493
she said,

3100
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:06,100
I got so paranoid.

3101
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:07,810
She said I couldn't sleep all night.

3102
01:23:07,811 --> 01:23:08,171
Fortunately,

3103
01:23:08,171 --> 01:23:11,890
my friend took and didn't have any
problem and sort of watched over me,

3104
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:12,731
but she said,

3105
01:23:12,731 --> 01:23:15,250
the worst part was it took me weeks,

3106
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,340
weeks for the anxiety to faith.

3107
01:23:17,370 --> 01:23:17,980
And I said,

3108
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:18,341
I said,

3109
01:23:18,341 --> 01:23:18,850
do you have,

3110
01:23:18,850 --> 01:23:20,260
do you have a history of
mental health problems?

3111
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:20,651
And she said,

3112
01:23:20,651 --> 01:23:20,921
no,

3113
01:23:20,921 --> 01:23:21,461
I don't.

3114
01:23:21,461 --> 01:23:22,210
She said,

3115
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:22,571
she said,

3116
01:23:22,571 --> 01:23:23,321
and I'd used,

3117
01:23:23,321 --> 01:23:23,531
you know,

3118
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:25,300
I'd smoked in college and,

3119
01:23:25,310 --> 01:23:26,143
uh,

3120
01:23:26,290 --> 01:23:28,420
but this was just a totally
different experience.

3121
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:30,370
There's a big problem with education,

3122
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:33,100
a big problem with the
education that edible marijuana,

3123
01:23:33,101 --> 01:23:34,090
as we talked about before,

3124
01:23:34,091 --> 01:23:35,230
I think you were in the bathroom,

3125
01:23:35,231 --> 01:23:38,290
the 11 hydroxy metabolite as
it's processed by the liver,

3126
01:23:38,291 --> 01:23:39,700
it's a radically different truck,

3127
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:43,270
radically different and it's
really a psychedelic and in a very,

3128
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:44,920
for me personally,

3129
01:23:46,150 --> 01:23:48,700
edible marijuana and flotation tanks,

3130
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:50,980
I might as well be taking
a fucking bucket of acid

3131
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:54,700
crazy God experience.

3132
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:59,590
Now I personally enjoy being paranoid
and I know this sounds crazy,

3133
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:02,080
but I think with me it gives me an,

3134
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:07,100
I think I live a pretty
blessed life and I like,

3135
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:12,190
I liked the feeling of paranoia because
it allows me to explore maybe some area

3136
01:24:12,191 --> 01:24:14,840
like maybe a specific
paranoia that you have.

3137
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:15,940
It's a freak out man.

3138
01:24:16,530 --> 01:24:20,980
I think I have maybe an
abundance of confidence.

3139
01:24:21,010 --> 01:24:22,060
Maybe I have too much,

3140
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:22,540
right?

3141
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:23,800
Maybe I'm too successful.

3142
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:28,980
What I like about the paranoia that comes
with edible marijuana is it allows me

3143
01:24:29,801 --> 01:24:30,790
to check myself.

3144
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:32,290
It allows me to put myself,

3145
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:37,440
examine all of my behavior in the darkest
recesses of my mind and my thoughts

3146
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:40,150
and and gives me a purse.

3147
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:43,890
And it makes me a nicer person
might go just a little tiny,

3148
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,570
just like the other
psychedelics were thing.

3149
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:47,260
It just,

3150
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:49,260
it gives you just a little knock stone,

3151
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:49,571
an eagle,

3152
01:24:49,571 --> 01:24:49,991
just little,

3153
01:24:49,991 --> 01:24:54,490
I mean some people use it and like at the
end of the day and then you know like,

3154
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:55,331
like Joe said,

3155
01:24:55,331 --> 01:25:00,070
I think it makes you reflect
sometimes better and more objectively.

3156
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:01,093
Meaning that like,

3157
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:01,720
you know,

3158
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:04,850
maybe you hadn't encountered with someone
early on the day and then you know

3159
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:07,120
late at night or you toke
up a bit and you're like,

3160
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:07,750
oh man,

3161
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:09,610
I probably should have done
things a little bit different.

3162
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:10,211
You know,

3163
01:25:10,211 --> 01:25:12,340
like that happens to people all,

3164
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:12,941
all the time.

3165
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:13,330
It just,

3166
01:25:13,330 --> 01:25:18,330
it forces you to reflect in a different
state and sometimes when you reflect in

3167
01:25:18,761 --> 01:25:19,510
that state,

3168
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:21,310
you come up with thoughts that,

3169
01:25:21,490 --> 01:25:23,200
that you just want to come up with before.

3170
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:23,470
Yeah,

3171
01:25:23,470 --> 01:25:25,570
like my patients say to me all the time,

3172
01:25:25,571 --> 01:25:29,380
like it just kind of breaks
this negative state that I have.

3173
01:25:29,530 --> 01:25:30,870
I'm just able to,

3174
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:31,180
to,

3175
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:31,440
to,

3176
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,760
to break out of a negative
state and think logically,

3177
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:34,773
you know,

3178
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:36,440
people say that to me all the time,

3179
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:37,061
but let's see.

3180
01:25:37,061 --> 01:25:37,720
You're,

3181
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:38,051
to me,

3182
01:25:38,051 --> 01:25:41,320
you're talking about something
different and it works for you,

3183
01:25:41,321 --> 01:25:41,600
right?

3184
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:42,000
Your,

3185
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,210
your paranoia is,

3186
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:44,111
it sounds more,

3187
01:25:44,111 --> 01:25:45,280
almost existential.

3188
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,050
It's how can I be a better person?

3189
01:25:47,051 --> 01:25:48,610
What am I doing wrong in my life?

3190
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:51,190
It's not my wife is poisoning me.

3191
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:51,880
No,

3192
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:52,290
no,

3193
01:25:52,290 --> 01:25:53,123
no,

3194
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:54,770
no joke.

3195
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:55,961
This is funny.

3196
01:25:55,961 --> 01:25:57,090
And your schizophrenia,

3197
01:25:57,790 --> 01:25:58,061
yeah,

3198
01:25:58,061 --> 01:25:58,301
no,

3199
01:25:58,301 --> 01:26:00,310
I used to have or you know,

3200
01:26:00,311 --> 01:26:03,860
or the cops aren't going to bust
through the fucking door then shoot me.

3201
01:26:03,890 --> 01:26:04,723
Yes.

3202
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:05,960
It's a different thing.

3203
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:07,010
And that's why,

3204
01:26:07,670 --> 01:26:12,080
that's why Marin marijuana drives
this extreme violence in some people.

3205
01:26:12,110 --> 01:26:15,260
Or those people need to get their fucking
shit together when that's possible

3206
01:26:15,261 --> 01:26:15,560
too.

3207
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:15,940
Well,

3208
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:16,773
I mean,

3209
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:18,973
they may need,

3210
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:20,630
aliens aren't really common bro,

3211
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:23,690
but they may need to be
intervened before and,

3212
01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:25,220
and to Joe's point though,

3213
01:26:25,370 --> 01:26:30,370
they have shown in studies that if you
make an intervention other outside of the

3214
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:33,290
psychotic symptoms,

3215
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:35,840
you can actually reduce
the incidents of violence.

3216
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:36,741
And also too,

3217
01:26:36,741 --> 01:26:37,251
I think it's,

3218
01:26:37,251 --> 01:26:37,470
you know,

3219
01:26:37,470 --> 01:26:41,870
a good point I was going
to mention earlier to bring
up genetics because we are

3220
01:26:41,871 --> 01:26:45,950
teasing out genetics for people and we
are discovering that certain people do

3221
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:50,951
have certain genetics that do predispose
them to certain cannabis disorders.

3222
01:26:51,261 --> 01:26:51,501
Right?

3223
01:26:51,501 --> 01:26:51,990
So,

3224
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:52,520
you know,

3225
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:54,110
I'm involved with,

3226
01:26:54,111 --> 01:26:54,231
with,

3227
01:26:54,231 --> 01:26:56,900
with the company that's doing that
right now and we're trying to create,

3228
01:26:57,150 --> 01:26:57,470
um,

3229
01:26:57,470 --> 01:26:59,360
cannabis genetic tests for people.

3230
01:26:59,540 --> 01:26:59,751
Right.

3231
01:26:59,751 --> 01:27:03,650
And there's three genes that
we've identified so far,

3232
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:04,140
you know,

3233
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:09,050
one of them is that Amy p k 14 geno
type and that has been shown to be

3234
01:27:09,051 --> 01:27:09,980
associated with,

3235
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:10,570
um,

3236
01:27:10,570 --> 01:27:10,810
a,

3237
01:27:10,810 --> 01:27:11,320
a,

3238
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:14,120
a deficit and brain volume
when you do use cannabis.

3239
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:15,590
And then there's two other genes,

3240
01:27:15,591 --> 01:27:19,460
the akt one and the ca
d and M to Geno type.

3241
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:19,851
You know,

3242
01:27:19,851 --> 01:27:23,210
both of those have also been shown
to be associated with cannabis.

3243
01:27:23,211 --> 01:27:24,044
But again,

3244
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:24,560
you know,

3245
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:25,760
how many people have them?

3246
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:26,330
Um,

3247
01:27:26,330 --> 01:27:30,260
BMAP K 14 it's roughly about
8% is what we're seeing.

3248
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:34,940
The akt one is around 4%
and the ca DM two is around,

3249
01:27:34,970 --> 01:27:35,960
is around 5%.

3250
01:27:35,961 --> 01:27:39,380
So there's so many that up that's
almost 20% of the population,

3251
01:27:39,381 --> 01:27:39,710
but,

3252
01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:40,100
but,

3253
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:40,933
but we're seeing,

3254
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:42,650
but if we can identify,

3255
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:43,520
um,

3256
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:44,910
I love that stuff lines me.

3257
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:45,790
Yeah,

3258
01:27:45,790 --> 01:27:46,620
it's wicked.

3259
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:47,270
Um,

3260
01:27:47,270 --> 01:27:49,490
so if we can identify,

3261
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:49,960
you know,

3262
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:50,190
the,

3263
01:27:50,190 --> 01:27:51,860
the people who are at risk,

3264
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:54,230
then we can maybe potentially,

3265
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:54,711
you know,

3266
01:27:54,711 --> 01:27:59,270
you use the medicine in a way where
only the people who don't have these

3267
01:27:59,271 --> 01:28:00,740
genetics are using the medicine.

3268
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:01,430
And then,

3269
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:01,641
you know,

3270
01:28:01,641 --> 01:28:04,250
for the people who do have these genetics,

3271
01:28:04,251 --> 01:28:04,401
you know,

3272
01:28:04,401 --> 01:28:06,560
they stick mostly to CBD.

3273
01:28:06,770 --> 01:28:07,930
I just think you know,

3274
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:10,130
that that's a better approach then,

3275
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:10,521
you know,

3276
01:28:10,521 --> 01:28:11,030
just,

3277
01:28:11,030 --> 01:28:13,670
just kind of prohibiting
cannabis are saying that,

3278
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:14,001
you know,

3279
01:28:14,001 --> 01:28:14,720
we shouldn't,

3280
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:15,740
we shouldn't use it at all,

3281
01:28:15,741 --> 01:28:17,570
are saying that it's not medicine.

3282
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:21,620
I think that it should be held to the
same standard as any other medicine.

3283
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:25,400
And I think that if we had an incredible
medicine that worked for some people

3284
01:28:25,401 --> 01:28:28,970
and that didn't work for others than what
we would do is we would try to figure

3285
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:29,804
out why.

3286
01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:30,703
And you know,

3287
01:28:30,830 --> 01:28:31,760
I've been doing that.

3288
01:28:31,761 --> 01:28:33,020
My companies have been doing that.

3289
01:28:33,021 --> 01:28:34,070
It's called a net life.

3290
01:28:34,071 --> 01:28:34,490
You know,

3291
01:28:34,490 --> 01:28:35,241
full disclosure,

3292
01:28:35,241 --> 01:28:36,320
I am on the board,

3293
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:36,800
um,

3294
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:39,200
and that life t.com and you know,

3295
01:28:39,330 --> 01:28:40,160
um,

3296
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:42,080
and when we use these different,

3297
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:43,730
these different strategies,

3298
01:28:44,150 --> 01:28:46,310
then we can actually
reduce the overall harm.

3299
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:50,030
And that should be another thing that
we can add into the mix because for sure

3300
01:28:50,031 --> 01:28:53,560
there's people who are definitely
more predisposed to mental illness and

3301
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:55,610
definitely more predisposed to,

3302
01:28:55,850 --> 01:28:57,080
to a psychosis.

3303
01:28:57,260 --> 01:28:57,460
I mean,

3304
01:28:57,460 --> 01:28:57,860
they're,

3305
01:28:57,860 --> 01:28:59,540
there do seem to be some people who just,

3306
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,010
it breaks really.

3307
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,100
And I'm not sure

3308
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:02,370
why.

3309
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:02,611
I mean,

3310
01:29:02,611 --> 01:29:02,851
again,

3311
01:29:02,851 --> 01:29:04,080
it's probably genetic.

3312
01:29:04,110 --> 01:29:04,320
There's,

3313
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:04,460
yeah,

3314
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:06,720
I think it's you,

3315
01:29:06,770 --> 01:29:07,770
you mentioned,

3316
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:08,610
uh,

3317
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:08,881
you know,

3318
01:29:08,881 --> 01:29:09,451
your,

3319
01:29:09,451 --> 01:29:10,320
your friend who's,

3320
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:10,710
uh,

3321
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:12,090
who's child has autism and,

3322
01:29:12,270 --> 01:29:12,781
and you said,

3323
01:29:12,781 --> 01:29:13,051
well,

3324
01:29:13,051 --> 01:29:13,381
you know,

3325
01:29:13,381 --> 01:29:13,740
I,

3326
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:14,431
if that,

3327
01:29:14,431 --> 01:29:15,210
if that were my child,

3328
01:29:15,210 --> 01:29:17,520
of course I would want
to do anything possible.

3329
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,980
But I have to tell you in the last
month since the book came out,

3330
01:29:20,010 --> 01:29:22,020
I've heard the other side of this.

3331
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:22,290
Okay.

3332
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:27,290
I've heard from so many parents
whose children and in many cases,

3333
01:29:27,451 --> 01:29:28,560
high functioning children,

3334
01:29:28,561 --> 01:29:29,400
college graduates.

3335
01:29:29,401 --> 01:29:29,941
Because by the way,

3336
01:29:29,941 --> 01:29:30,940
those are the people you know,

3337
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:32,510
read the book or heard about the book.

3338
01:29:32,511 --> 01:29:32,850
And,

3339
01:29:32,850 --> 01:29:35,970
and who have the resources
to stay involved with their
kids when they have these

3340
01:29:35,971 --> 01:29:36,804
terrible breaks.

3341
01:29:37,050 --> 01:29:37,440
Who,

3342
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:37,870
who,

3343
01:29:37,870 --> 01:29:40,050
who've gone completely off the rails.

3344
01:29:40,051 --> 01:29:42,360
And the worst story
that I've heard so far,

3345
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:43,230
um,

3346
01:29:43,230 --> 01:29:47,580
came from a woman in Connecticut whose
son graduated from high referred,

3347
01:29:47,581 --> 01:29:47,791
you know,

3348
01:29:47,791 --> 01:29:50,790
it's a college in the east and um,

3349
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:51,031
you know,

3350
01:29:51,031 --> 01:29:52,650
sounds like a really good guy.

3351
01:29:52,650 --> 01:29:53,483
He wanted to,

3352
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:54,010
Eh,

3353
01:29:54,010 --> 01:29:54,360
you know,

3354
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:55,770
teach disadvantaged kids.

3355
01:29:55,771 --> 01:29:59,310
He had a girlfriend who was going to met
or it was a premed trying to go to med

3356
01:29:59,311 --> 01:29:59,820
school.

3357
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:03,330
They moved to New Mexico and for some
reason the guy decided to start smoking.

3358
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:07,140
And this was 2012 and within a
few months he lost everything.

3359
01:30:07,170 --> 01:30:07,830
Okay.

3360
01:30:07,830 --> 01:30:09,090
The girlfriend had left,

3361
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:10,050
he lost his job.

3362
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:12,000
He had his first
inpatient hospitalization.

3363
01:30:12,210 --> 01:30:13,590
Now this is a family with money.

3364
01:30:13,710 --> 01:30:13,951
Okay,

3365
01:30:13,951 --> 01:30:15,570
this is Connecticut's a bourbon.

3366
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:16,590
Uh,

3367
01:30:16,590 --> 01:30:21,590
and they have spent the last six years
trying to save their son and they have

3368
01:30:21,871 --> 01:30:22,681
failed that.

3369
01:30:22,681 --> 01:30:25,140
She told me that they've spent
more than half a million dollars.

3370
01:30:25,350 --> 01:30:27,510
He was hospitalized at Harvard,

3371
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:27,991
you know,

3372
01:30:27,991 --> 01:30:28,141
he,

3373
01:30:28,141 --> 01:30:29,220
he had the best treatment.

3374
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:32,370
None of it's made a difference to
him and what is sort of the symptoms.

3375
01:30:32,371 --> 01:30:32,700
And so,

3376
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:33,001
so,

3377
01:30:33,001 --> 01:30:33,570
so he's,

3378
01:30:33,570 --> 01:30:37,020
he's completely schizophrenia now and
he's completely paranoid and he believes,

3379
01:30:37,021 --> 01:30:37,670
and this is the,

3380
01:30:37,670 --> 01:30:38,190
this is the,

3381
01:30:38,190 --> 01:30:38,490
so he,

3382
01:30:38,490 --> 01:30:38,940
his,

3383
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:40,230
his girlfriend is long gone,

3384
01:30:40,231 --> 01:30:41,280
but she's tried CBD.

3385
01:30:41,830 --> 01:30:42,663
Uh,

3386
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:43,740
that's a good question.

3387
01:30:43,741 --> 01:30:45,660
I think he's continued to use cannabis.

3388
01:30:45,661 --> 01:30:47,010
I don't know if he's used CBD,

3389
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:47,700
but let me,

3390
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:49,800
let me just tell you where he is now.

3391
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:50,460
Okay.

3392
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:53,190
So he's one of these guys who
has a really bad delusion.

3393
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:57,030
His delusion is that his girlfriend
has died and been replaced by a robot.

3394
01:30:57,390 --> 01:30:59,760
So that's the kind of delusion
that leads you to kill people.

3395
01:31:00,090 --> 01:31:00,923
And so,

3396
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:04,080
and so this guy has been
now hospital as 17 times.

3397
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:05,060
He's,

3398
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:05,850
he's gone.

3399
01:31:05,850 --> 01:31:06,091
He's,

3400
01:31:06,091 --> 01:31:07,530
he's on the streets of Houston.

3401
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:09,030
She doesn't know where he is.

3402
01:31:09,031 --> 01:31:09,571
And I'll tell you,

3403
01:31:09,571 --> 01:31:09,781
you know,

3404
01:31:09,781 --> 01:31:10,830
you read beautiful boy,

3405
01:31:10,831 --> 01:31:12,360
you see the movie and you think,

3406
01:31:12,361 --> 01:31:12,531
well,

3407
01:31:12,531 --> 01:31:13,760
the one I'm not familiar.

3408
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:14,100
Oh,

3409
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:15,120
beautiful boys about,

3410
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:15,540
um,

3411
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:16,291
a beautiful mind,

3412
01:31:16,291 --> 01:31:16,560
isn't it?

3413
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:16,711
No,

3414
01:31:16,711 --> 01:31:16,831
no.

3415
01:31:16,831 --> 01:31:17,860
Beautiful boy is the,

3416
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:20,730
is a book that came out I think a couple
of years ago and got turned into a

3417
01:31:20,731 --> 01:31:21,300
movie.

3418
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:23,730
You should have him on a
nic Sheff and David Sheff,

3419
01:31:23,790 --> 01:31:24,060
um,

3420
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:29,060
father and son and the son became a
meth addict and essentially almost died.

3421
01:31:30,660 --> 01:31:31,200
Uh,

3422
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:31,920
he,

3423
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:32,753
they,

3424
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,010
he started smoking
cannabis when he was 12,

3425
01:31:35,011 --> 01:31:37,920
and within a couple of years it had
all gone completely downhill for him.

3426
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:38,590
Um,

3427
01:31:38,590 --> 01:31:39,840
I'm surprised it's a,

3428
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:41,070
it's a pretty popular book,

3429
01:31:41,071 --> 01:31:41,760
but anyway,

3430
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:42,593
have you heard of it?

3431
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:43,260
Um,

3432
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:45,600
Jamie and I've heard of the movie.

3433
01:31:45,601 --> 01:31:45,960
Yeah.

3434
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:46,260
Yeah.

3435
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:46,890
Um,

3436
01:31:46,890 --> 01:31:47,550
so,

3437
01:31:47,550 --> 01:31:48,241
so you think,

3438
01:31:48,241 --> 01:31:48,391
well,

3439
01:31:48,391 --> 01:31:48,601
okay.

3440
01:31:48,601 --> 01:31:49,760
The worst thing that can happen,

3441
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:50,281
you as a parent,

3442
01:31:50,281 --> 01:31:52,440
the worst thing is your,

3443
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:56,610
your child becomes an opioid addict and
you wait for the call that he overdosed

3444
01:31:56,611 --> 01:31:57,270
and died.

3445
01:31:57,270 --> 01:31:59,010
It turns out that that's the second worst.

3446
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:02,110
The worst thing that
can happen is your son,

3447
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:03,850
the college graduate,

3448
01:32:04,090 --> 01:32:05,200
the want to be,

3449
01:32:05,201 --> 01:32:10,000
do good or becomes a schizophrenia living
on the streets and then you're waiting

3450
01:32:10,001 --> 01:32:12,910
for the call that he killed
himself or he killed somebody else.

3451
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:13,953
And so my,

3452
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:14,260
my,

3453
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:14,830
you know,

3454
01:32:14,830 --> 01:32:15,410
my,

3455
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:17,860
my view of this is in a
couple more years probably,

3456
01:32:17,861 --> 01:32:18,101
I mean,

3457
01:32:18,101 --> 01:32:20,110
this book has taken
over my life obviously,

3458
01:32:20,350 --> 01:32:22,840
but in a couple of years I'm going
to be back to writing novels.

3459
01:32:22,841 --> 01:32:23,260
I'm going to be,

3460
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:23,461
you know,

3461
01:32:23,461 --> 01:32:23,741
I'll still,

3462
01:32:23,741 --> 01:32:25,030
but this will still be part of my life.

3463
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:26,110
But this woman,

3464
01:32:26,260 --> 01:32:27,100
these parents,

3465
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:31,210
they are going to spend their lives trying
to destroy the cannabis industry and

3466
01:32:31,211 --> 01:32:32,044
that is real.

3467
01:32:32,370 --> 01:32:32,730
Well,

3468
01:32:32,730 --> 01:32:33,421
I think,

3469
01:32:33,421 --> 01:32:33,750
uh,

3470
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:36,090
that would be a foolish thing to do.

3471
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:36,630
Uh,

3472
01:32:36,630 --> 01:32:40,620
but I think there is a real possibility
that some people who have a tendency to

3473
01:32:40,621 --> 01:32:42,900
schizophrenia could be
triggered by cannabis.

3474
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:43,760
I don't,

3475
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:45,360
there's no need to know Ashton about that,

3476
01:32:45,390 --> 01:32:48,360
but I think it's also possible that guy
would've gotten schizophrenia anyway.

3477
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:48,961
Look,

3478
01:32:48,961 --> 01:32:49,651
it's possible.

3479
01:32:49,651 --> 01:32:52,880
But he was sort of at the outer edge
of the window and he had no other,

3480
01:32:52,890 --> 01:32:55,830
the other edge of the
window and watch for boys.

3481
01:32:55,831 --> 01:33:00,390
It's sort of 17 to 2124 was he showing
any issues before it all according to

3482
01:33:00,391 --> 01:33:00,541
her?

3483
01:33:00,541 --> 01:33:01,500
I mean this is from her,

3484
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:02,393
so she's the mother,

3485
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:05,070
but I'm sure she'd be the
one who knows the most.

3486
01:33:05,071 --> 01:33:06,300
There are people though too,

3487
01:33:06,301 --> 01:33:10,700
who just kind of have a decline with
or without cannabis and you do here.

3488
01:33:10,740 --> 01:33:12,670
Sometimes it's schizophrenia
just to break up.

3489
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:15,010
They just can't handle life.

3490
01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:16,530
I mean,

3491
01:33:16,530 --> 01:33:17,490
I know people,

3492
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:19,570
you know that we've gotten
a medical and stuff,

3493
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:23,490
have gone to medical school and then
one semester they just can't handle the

3494
01:33:23,491 --> 01:33:26,250
course load and then their
life just goes to shit.

3495
01:33:26,850 --> 01:33:28,320
They drop out of school.

3496
01:33:28,590 --> 01:33:29,970
No one ever hears from them again.

3497
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:30,880
They don't read,

3498
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:31,420
you know,

3499
01:33:31,420 --> 01:33:31,770
get,

3500
01:33:31,770 --> 01:33:32,940
get back into school.

3501
01:33:33,090 --> 01:33:33,630
That's it.

3502
01:33:33,630 --> 01:33:34,060
But that,

3503
01:33:34,060 --> 01:33:35,730
that does happen all the time.

3504
01:33:35,731 --> 01:33:38,310
That speaks to the
fragility of the human mind.

3505
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:39,693
You know,

3506
01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:41,850
it's a terrible,

3507
01:33:41,850 --> 01:33:42,683
it is to have,

3508
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:46,410
it has and it affects a certain
percentage of the population regardless of

3509
01:33:46,411 --> 01:33:47,244
cannabis use.

3510
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:48,060
Um,

3511
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:50,490
there's a lot of people out there that
have schizophrenia that I've never used

3512
01:33:50,491 --> 01:33:54,690
cannabis ever and they've gone
completely off off the edge.

3513
01:33:55,210 --> 01:33:55,800
Um,

3514
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:58,560
I don't know if you can necessarily
blame cannabis for that.

3515
01:33:58,890 --> 01:33:59,340
Uh,

3516
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:02,970
and it would be really interesting to
find out if there was some form of a

3517
01:34:02,971 --> 01:34:03,570
treatment,

3518
01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:05,910
like you were saying with CBD that uh,

3519
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:10,940
could counteract that or it has been
shown in early stage studies to have some

3520
01:34:11,581 --> 01:34:13,140
moderate impact on psychosis.

3521
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:14,950
I don't think from the,

3522
01:34:15,110 --> 01:34:17,970
the numbers that I've seen suggest it
really isn't that strong as an anti

3523
01:34:17,971 --> 01:34:18,391
psychotic.

3524
01:34:18,391 --> 01:34:22,590
But I do think that if I were
a researcher and schizophrenia,

3525
01:34:22,591 --> 01:34:24,660
I would be looking at the
endocannabinoid system.

3526
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:24,881
Yeah,

3527
01:34:24,881 --> 01:34:26,100
you have to look at this.

3528
01:34:26,101 --> 01:34:26,341
Again,

3529
01:34:26,341 --> 01:34:29,490
I look at it from a clinical perspective.

3530
01:34:29,491 --> 01:34:32,940
Like the Anti psychotics that
we have out there are not good,

3531
01:34:33,110 --> 01:34:33,810
terrible.

3532
01:34:33,810 --> 01:34:38,540
They have terrible side effects and most
of them do have some initial benefit

3533
01:34:39,050 --> 01:34:39,571
benefit.

3534
01:34:39,571 --> 01:34:40,770
But after two to three years,

3535
01:34:40,970 --> 01:34:42,600
it was almost no benefit one way.

3536
01:34:42,601 --> 01:34:43,370
And they have a,

3537
01:34:43,370 --> 01:34:44,203
as you said,

3538
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:45,810
really bad side effects,

3539
01:34:45,811 --> 01:34:46,470
weight gain,

3540
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:47,610
metabolic disturbances,

3541
01:34:47,611 --> 01:34:49,270
like people want to get off of them.

3542
01:34:49,271 --> 01:34:54,120
So if you have something like CBD that
doesn't have any of those side effects,

3543
01:34:54,270 --> 01:34:55,680
of course as a clinician,

3544
01:34:55,710 --> 01:34:56,760
you're going to want to try it,

3545
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:57,171
right.

3546
01:34:57,171 --> 01:34:58,004
Because you know that

3547
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:00,470
the other tools that you have
are not really that effective.

3548
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:01,041
Right.

3549
01:35:01,041 --> 01:35:01,550
So,

3550
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:01,821
you know,

3551
01:35:01,821 --> 01:35:02,600
CBD can,

3552
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:02,830
should,

3553
01:35:02,830 --> 01:35:03,860
should definitely be,

3554
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:04,280
um,

3555
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:04,461
you know,

3556
01:35:04,461 --> 01:35:05,690
utilize for people who have,

3557
01:35:05,691 --> 01:35:07,280
who have psychosis and schizophrenia.

3558
01:35:07,430 --> 01:35:07,580
Well,

3559
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:07,940
I think,

3560
01:35:07,940 --> 01:35:08,140
you know,

3561
01:35:08,140 --> 01:35:10,100
we talked about life changes,

3562
01:35:10,101 --> 01:35:12,980
like things that happen badly
and you live losing your job,

3563
01:35:12,981 --> 01:35:14,180
losing your girlfriend.

3564
01:35:14,181 --> 01:35:14,570
Um,

3565
01:35:14,570 --> 01:35:15,980
deaths in the family can,

3566
01:35:16,070 --> 01:35:16,970
can trigger these breaks,

3567
01:35:16,971 --> 01:35:17,804
but some folks,

3568
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:19,730
but psychedelic drugs can as well.

3569
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:19,941
I mean,

3570
01:35:19,941 --> 01:35:21,500
it's a fact for some people.

3571
01:35:21,501 --> 01:35:24,650
Psychedelic drugs have
tremendous benefits for PTSD.

3572
01:35:24,940 --> 01:35:25,190
Uh,

3573
01:35:25,190 --> 01:35:26,300
quitting alcohol.

3574
01:35:26,301 --> 01:35:29,930
Quitting a hard drugs is a lot of
people that have used mushrooms.

3575
01:35:29,931 --> 01:35:34,310
Mtma for PTSD is a huge thing
that maps is studying right now.

3576
01:35:34,670 --> 01:35:39,140
But you can't deny that there's other
people and well documented that have taken

3577
01:35:39,141 --> 01:35:39,831
LSD,

3578
01:35:39,831 --> 01:35:44,300
that have taken psilocybin and taking
them in large doses and then gone and

3579
01:35:44,301 --> 01:35:45,134
never recovered.

3580
01:35:45,830 --> 01:35:46,700
And that's why too,

3581
01:35:46,701 --> 01:35:47,720
I forget who it was.

3582
01:35:47,721 --> 01:35:48,351
Maybe it was,

3583
01:35:48,351 --> 01:35:48,740
um,

3584
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:49,790
Mckenna who is on,

3585
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:51,410
and you guys were saying that like,

3586
01:35:51,590 --> 01:35:52,130
you know,

3587
01:35:52,130 --> 01:35:53,330
we need to use,

3588
01:35:53,350 --> 01:35:53,660
um,

3589
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:54,770
psychedelic medicines,

3590
01:35:54,771 --> 01:35:56,780
but we need to use them properly.

3591
01:35:57,350 --> 01:35:58,910
And that's the same way with,

3592
01:35:58,940 --> 01:35:59,241
with,

3593
01:35:59,241 --> 01:35:59,420
uh,

3594
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:00,560
with cannabis as well.

3595
01:36:00,710 --> 01:36:02,520
I considered cannabis a psychedelic,

3596
01:36:02,690 --> 01:36:03,680
particularly when you eat it.

3597
01:36:03,860 --> 01:36:04,940
Absolutely it is,

3598
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,920
it is a mild psychedelic and you know,

3599
01:36:06,921 --> 01:36:07,181
so,

3600
01:36:07,181 --> 01:36:08,720
so there's risks and benefits to that.

3601
01:36:08,721 --> 01:36:09,111
And you know,

3602
01:36:09,111 --> 01:36:12,200
we need to tease out the rest and tease
out the benefits and making sure that

3603
01:36:12,530 --> 01:36:13,363
people are,

3604
01:36:13,410 --> 01:36:13,790
we make,

3605
01:36:13,790 --> 01:36:14,241
but Alex,

3606
01:36:14,241 --> 01:36:17,510
we need to make sure that people are
informed and they get the entire picture.

3607
01:36:17,690 --> 01:36:17,901
Right.

3608
01:36:17,901 --> 01:36:18,410
So,

3609
01:36:18,410 --> 01:36:19,160
you know,

3610
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:21,140
does your book have some truth in it?

3611
01:36:21,141 --> 01:36:21,471
Yes,

3612
01:36:21,471 --> 01:36:22,310
of course it does.

3613
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:23,930
But does it tell the whole truth?

3614
01:36:24,170 --> 01:36:25,100
Absolutely not.

3615
01:36:25,101 --> 01:36:25,341
Right.

3616
01:36:25,341 --> 01:36:26,540
And that's the message that,

3617
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:26,961
you know,

3618
01:36:26,961 --> 01:36:28,280
I think people should be hearing,

3619
01:36:28,281 --> 01:36:30,740
people shouldn't be hearing
just part of the truth.

3620
01:36:30,740 --> 01:36:32,030
They should be hearing the whole truth.

3621
01:36:32,031 --> 01:36:32,720
And again,

3622
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:33,050
you know,

3623
01:36:33,050 --> 01:36:33,861
like in your book,

3624
01:36:33,861 --> 01:36:34,694
like you compared,

3625
01:36:34,770 --> 01:36:35,110
you know,

3626
01:36:35,110 --> 01:36:35,330
the,

3627
01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:37,100
the met Mexico and in India,

3628
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:37,700
right.

3629
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:38,450
And you know,

3630
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:39,141
I talked to,

3631
01:36:39,141 --> 01:36:41,600
to German Lopez on the phone
about this and you know,

3632
01:36:41,601 --> 01:36:43,100
who talked to Isaac Cam shows,

3633
01:36:43,101 --> 01:36:43,640
right?

3634
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:44,473
And he said,

3635
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:45,140
so,

3636
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:46,460
so Isaac came post,

3637
01:36:46,461 --> 01:36:46,641
you know,

3638
01:36:46,641 --> 01:36:47,480
he's the guy who,

3639
01:36:47,660 --> 01:36:48,493
who basically,

3640
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:49,050
you know,

3641
01:36:49,050 --> 01:36:50,480
it was told the story of how,

3642
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:51,530
um,

3643
01:36:51,530 --> 01:36:52,610
how in Mexico,

3644
01:36:52,730 --> 01:36:52,941
you know,

3645
01:36:52,941 --> 01:36:53,960
people were blaming,

3646
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:54,620
uh,

3647
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:55,440
marijuana.

3648
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:56,480
People were blaming,

3649
01:36:56,670 --> 01:36:57,490
um,

3650
01:36:57,490 --> 01:37:01,880
Ma marijuana on causing psychosis during
kind of like the early 19 hundreds.

3651
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:02,690
Um,

3652
01:37:02,690 --> 01:37:05,570
and then there was some evidence
as well in India at that time.

3653
01:37:05,571 --> 01:37:06,950
So I was kind of made the connection,

3654
01:37:06,951 --> 01:37:07,430
you know,

3655
01:37:07,430 --> 01:37:08,900
9,000 miles apart.

3656
01:37:09,110 --> 01:37:09,360
You know,

3657
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,180
they're both saying the same thing,

3658
01:37:11,181 --> 01:37:12,020
but you know,

3659
01:37:12,021 --> 01:37:12,890
he said that,

3660
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:13,150
you know,

3661
01:37:13,150 --> 01:37:15,620
you did misinterpret the evidence on it.

3662
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:15,861
Right.

3663
01:37:15,861 --> 01:37:16,051
And,

3664
01:37:16,051 --> 01:37:17,560
and in German told me that on the,

3665
01:37:17,561 --> 01:37:18,770
on the phone and I mean,

3666
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:22,040
all the cannabis that was used
in Mexico at that time was in,

3667
01:37:22,190 --> 01:37:22,461
you know,

3668
01:37:22,461 --> 01:37:24,290
really marginalized environments.

3669
01:37:24,291 --> 01:37:25,124
And then when you look at,

3670
01:37:25,330 --> 01:37:25,730
um,

3671
01:37:25,730 --> 01:37:26,720
the India study,

3672
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:27,620
you know,

3673
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:28,010
they,

3674
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:30,530
and I know that you addressed this in
your book out because I did read your

3675
01:37:30,531 --> 01:37:30,761
book,

3676
01:37:30,761 --> 01:37:32,630
so I bought your book.

3677
01:37:32,631 --> 01:37:32,931
So,

3678
01:37:32,931 --> 01:37:33,200
you know,

3679
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:34,920
in some ways I did get support here.

3680
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:36,693
Um,

3681
01:37:36,770 --> 01:37:37,461
so I,

3682
01:37:37,461 --> 01:37:37,731
uh,

3683
01:37:37,731 --> 01:37:39,380
I read your book and like I said,

3684
01:37:39,381 --> 01:37:39,620
you know,

3685
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:42,990
you did address in the
part on India that um,

3686
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:43,340
yeah,

3687
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:43,731
you know,

3688
01:37:43,731 --> 01:37:44,331
some of the,

3689
01:37:44,331 --> 01:37:44,480
uh,

3690
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:46,280
report was wrong,

3691
01:37:46,310 --> 01:37:48,210
but I mean the fact is that all,

3692
01:37:48,211 --> 01:37:50,810
almost a lot of those cases in India were,

3693
01:37:51,050 --> 01:37:54,320
were actually attributed to
alcohol or opiates or other things.

3694
01:37:54,321 --> 01:37:55,920
And then the other thing in,

3695
01:37:55,921 --> 01:37:56,250
in,

3696
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:56,730
uh,

3697
01:37:56,730 --> 01:37:58,800
in Mexico is that it was
in those environments.

3698
01:37:58,800 --> 01:37:59,220
So,

3699
01:37:59,220 --> 01:37:59,910
you know,

3700
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:02,100
basically what I'm kinda
getting and I hear is like,

3701
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:02,611
you know,

3702
01:38:02,611 --> 01:38:02,791
the,

3703
01:38:02,791 --> 01:38:05,490
the National Academy of
Sciences and Engineering,

3704
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:05,700
you know,

3705
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:06,510
they,

3706
01:38:06,510 --> 01:38:06,751
you know,

3707
01:38:06,751 --> 01:38:09,210
disagree with how you interpret it,

3708
01:38:09,270 --> 01:38:11,910
their findings and then these people,

3709
01:38:12,990 --> 01:38:14,250
how you interpreted their fines.

3710
01:38:14,670 --> 01:38:15,120
Okay.

3711
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:18,150
But Ziva is only one of the 16 members.

3712
01:38:18,151 --> 01:38:18,984
I get that.

3713
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:20,700
But if we asked other members,

3714
01:38:20,701 --> 01:38:23,550
I think that they would all say
the same thing because Alex,

3715
01:38:23,670 --> 01:38:28,670
wouldn't you be upset if someone just
quoted one part of your book and then left

3716
01:38:30,031 --> 01:38:31,050
out all the other parts?

3717
01:38:31,051 --> 01:38:31,470
I mean,

3718
01:38:31,470 --> 01:38:34,560
I would think that would be
a huge disservice to my work.

3719
01:38:34,740 --> 01:38:35,830
I would not want,

3720
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:38,760
I would not have put what they put
in a ton of effort into something.

3721
01:38:39,030 --> 01:38:40,590
And then for someone to only have,

3722
01:38:40,730 --> 01:38:40,970
you know,

3723
01:38:40,970 --> 01:38:42,990
the judge just to pick up the part that,

3724
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:43,660
you know,

3725
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:45,720
I pet facilities ignores nuanced,

3726
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:46,261
honestly,

3727
01:38:46,261 --> 01:38:47,094
if I'd written

3728
01:38:47,140 --> 01:38:48,100
the Nis,

3729
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:48,371
yeah,

3730
01:38:48,371 --> 01:38:52,660
I'm reporting the NAM report and came
out in 2017 and nobody had paid any

3731
01:38:52,661 --> 01:38:53,261
attention to it,

3732
01:38:53,261 --> 01:38:56,860
which nobody did and nobody did for two
years and suddenly people were paying

3733
01:38:56,861 --> 01:38:57,461
attention to it.

3734
01:38:57,461 --> 01:38:58,660
I'd be pretty happy about that.

3735
01:38:58,840 --> 01:38:59,900
But what a,

3736
01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:02,500
what Dr. Hart is talking about is
in the first chapter of the book,

3737
01:39:02,501 --> 01:39:06,150
which I guess you haven't read and
I really should have a copy for it.

3738
01:39:06,730 --> 01:39:07,563
Stupid of me.

3739
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:08,833
Um,

3740
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:09,910
I've got a copy of my bag

3741
01:39:12,290 --> 01:39:14,010
so it's marked off.

3742
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:16,583
But,

3743
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:18,550
so this is fascinating to me.

3744
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:19,860
The,

3745
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:20,710
the British,

3746
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:21,011
you know,

3747
01:39:21,011 --> 01:39:25,090
they colonized India and they set up what
they called lunatic asylum was really

3748
01:39:25,091 --> 01:39:26,190
psychiatric hospitals,

3749
01:39:26,191 --> 01:39:28,030
sort of very primitive
psychiatric hospitals.

3750
01:39:28,031 --> 01:39:31,780
And they were really initially
for soldiers in the Indian
army and they were run

3751
01:39:31,781 --> 01:39:32,890
by British doctors.

3752
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:37,840
And what these doctors really as early
as like the lead 1850s and sixties

3753
01:39:37,841 --> 01:39:41,620
noticed was that a lot of the people
who showed up in these hospitals were

3754
01:39:41,621 --> 01:39:42,730
showing up with candidate.

3755
01:39:42,770 --> 01:39:46,840
What they called Ganja actually
in India is called Ganja or Bong,

3756
01:39:46,930 --> 01:39:49,050
which is a very weak preparation of a,

3757
01:39:49,051 --> 01:39:49,480
of,

3758
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:50,960
of basically uh,

3759
01:39:51,310 --> 01:39:52,143
uh,

3760
01:39:52,310 --> 01:39:53,020
uh,

3761
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:53,830
Indian hemp,

3762
01:39:53,830 --> 01:39:55,390
just sort of low grade cannabis.

3763
01:39:55,720 --> 01:39:56,410
Um,

3764
01:39:56,410 --> 01:39:57,220
and so,

3765
01:39:57,220 --> 01:40:01,780
and so they started counting and they
realized the 20 to 30% of the people who

3766
01:40:01,781 --> 01:40:05,260
were coming to asylums
were heavy cannabis users.

3767
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:07,180
And that was way more than alcohol.

3768
01:40:07,181 --> 01:40:08,014
It's more than opium.

3769
01:40:08,230 --> 01:40:09,790
And it's really fascinating.

3770
01:40:09,791 --> 01:40:12,130
Doctor named George Francis.

3771
01:40:12,131 --> 01:40:16,420
William Ewans wrote a book in 1908
and he looked at the evidence and,

3772
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:20,020
and it is amazing to hear how
he described schizophrenia,

3773
01:40:20,170 --> 01:40:21,490
how he describes cannabis,

3774
01:40:21,491 --> 01:40:23,950
how he describes the cases
of violence around cannabis.

3775
01:40:24,220 --> 01:40:25,053
It's like,

3776
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:27,250
it's like any psychiatrist today.

3777
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:29,980
Certainly any forensic
psychiatrists like my wife would,

3778
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:31,420
would like,

3779
01:40:31,510 --> 01:40:34,180
everything in the book
would ring completely true.

3780
01:40:34,420 --> 01:40:38,410
And it was so fascinating to me to stumble
on this and realize this is something

3781
01:40:38,411 --> 01:40:40,780
people have been talking about
for more than a hundred years.

3782
01:40:40,870 --> 01:40:41,470
Hmm.

3783
01:40:41,470 --> 01:40:43,630
So could we,

3784
01:40:43,770 --> 01:40:43,940
uh,

3785
01:40:43,940 --> 01:40:48,910
agreed that there are some people
where cannabis is not a good idea.

3786
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:49,833
Absolutely.

3787
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:50,590
Right.

3788
01:40:50,590 --> 01:40:52,580
We can agree that I think we all agree.

3789
01:40:52,810 --> 01:40:53,440
Um,

3790
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:54,010
we're also

3791
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:55,750
agree that some people can't eat peanuts.

3792
01:40:56,380 --> 01:40:56,981
Absolutely.

3793
01:40:56,981 --> 01:40:57,310
Yeah.

3794
01:40:57,310 --> 01:40:57,700
Yeah.

3795
01:40:57,700 --> 01:40:58,330
Right.

3796
01:40:58,330 --> 01:41:00,050
And it's not the same thing though,

3797
01:41:00,370 --> 01:41:00,751
but yet,

3798
01:41:00,751 --> 01:41:02,110
you know why peanuts kill you?

3799
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:03,160
That's w yeah,

3800
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:04,120
it's more dangerous.

3801
01:41:04,410 --> 01:41:07,510
So these 600 a year
people die from peanuts.

3802
01:41:07,511 --> 01:41:11,200
So I think more people die from cannabis
as a result of that homicide and the

3803
01:41:11,201 --> 01:41:11,770
suicide.

3804
01:41:11,770 --> 01:41:12,220
Okay.

3805
01:41:12,220 --> 01:41:12,461
Well,

3806
01:41:12,461 --> 01:41:13,600
there's no correlation.

3807
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:17,150
There's no paper that they know
somebody has got to do the work.

3808
01:41:17,151 --> 01:41:17,620
Blame a minute.

3809
01:41:17,620 --> 01:41:18,790
But why are you saying that then?

3810
01:41:19,270 --> 01:41:21,610
Because I've looked at
enough data to tell me,

3811
01:41:21,611 --> 01:41:23,590
you think marijuana is causing homicides.

3812
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:24,580
Oh yeah.

3813
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:25,690
This is what the book is about,

3814
01:41:25,691 --> 01:41:26,040
but it didn't.

3815
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:26,850
How so?

3816
01:41:26,850 --> 01:41:27,461
And what was,

3817
01:41:27,461 --> 01:41:29,710
it causes paranoia and
psychosis in people.

3818
01:41:29,711 --> 01:41:32,970
And paranoid psychosis are huge
risks for homicide and schizophrenia.

3819
01:41:33,770 --> 01:41:36,400
Studies that refute that was starting.

3820
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:37,780
No studies that refute that.

3821
01:41:37,781 --> 01:41:40,030
Paranoia and psychosis are
huge risks for homicide.

3822
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:43,180
Schizophrenia is a 20 x 20 times Joe.

3823
01:41:43,230 --> 01:41:43,690
Well,

3824
01:41:43,690 --> 01:41:44,051
Jamie,

3825
01:41:44,051 --> 01:41:45,820
I sent you a document,

3826
01:41:45,910 --> 01:41:46,540
uh,

3827
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:47,261
yesterday.

3828
01:41:47,261 --> 01:41:47,831
I mean there's,

3829
01:41:47,831 --> 01:41:49,990
there's multiple studies that show that,

3830
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:50,411
you know,

3831
01:41:50,411 --> 01:41:53,860
marijuana laws are not associated
with any type of violence.

3832
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,450
This was just talking about the drug.

3833
01:41:58,690 --> 01:41:59,770
So the use of the drug,

3834
01:41:59,771 --> 01:42:01,720
which could possibly trigger psychosis,

3835
01:42:01,810 --> 01:42:03,460
psychosis and schizophrenia,

3836
01:42:03,670 --> 01:42:05,620
which are correlated with murder.

3837
01:42:05,621 --> 01:42:06,190
So what you're saying,

3838
01:42:06,190 --> 01:42:07,390
they're not correlated their triggers.

3839
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:08,740
That's an absolute fact.

3840
01:42:08,980 --> 01:42:12,820
Triggers because of the paranoia and
delusions and you think that someone's out

3841
01:42:12,821 --> 01:42:14,380
to get you and they're not absolutely.

3842
01:42:14,381 --> 01:42:15,121
I mean the,

3843
01:42:15,121 --> 01:42:16,090
the out of the numbers.

3844
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:16,601
Okay.

3845
01:42:16,601 --> 01:42:17,680
So the numbers are,

3846
01:42:17,770 --> 01:42:18,340
if you are,

3847
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:20,230
if you have a diagnosis of schizophrenia,

3848
01:42:20,590 --> 01:42:21,070
uh,

3849
01:42:21,070 --> 01:42:23,140
you are 20 times as likely to commit.

3850
01:42:23,141 --> 01:42:24,610
Homicide is somebody who's healthy.

3851
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:25,090
Now.

3852
01:42:25,090 --> 01:42:26,890
It's actually worse
than that for cannabis.

3853
01:42:26,891 --> 01:42:27,131
Okay.

3854
01:42:27,131 --> 01:42:27,964
And here's why.

3855
01:42:28,230 --> 01:42:28,640
What,

3856
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:31,810
so the National Alliance for mental
illness and the mental illness,

3857
01:42:31,811 --> 01:42:32,380
advocacy,

3858
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:34,180
advocacy groups hate talking about this.

3859
01:42:34,181 --> 01:42:35,110
Why do they hate talking about it?

3860
01:42:35,140 --> 01:42:35,501
Obviously,

3861
01:42:35,501 --> 01:42:37,780
because it stigmatizes
people with mental illness.

3862
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:39,430
So what they say,

3863
01:42:39,490 --> 01:42:40,330
and this is true,

3864
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:42,460
is if you have a diagnosis,

3865
01:42:42,461 --> 01:42:44,230
but you're taking your anti psychotics,

3866
01:42:44,250 --> 01:42:46,150
even though the side
effects might be unpleasant,

3867
01:42:46,151 --> 01:42:46,984
you're in treatment,

3868
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:47,980
you're,

3869
01:42:47,980 --> 01:42:48,813
you're,

3870
01:42:48,940 --> 01:42:50,740
you're not using recreational drugs.

3871
01:42:51,010 --> 01:42:52,810
Your risk for violence isn't that high.

3872
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:54,940
It's not that much higher
than a healthy person.

3873
01:42:55,030 --> 01:42:55,750
Okay.

3874
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:56,471
And you know,

3875
01:42:56,471 --> 01:42:59,140
fortunately healthy people
don't commit murder that often.

3876
01:43:00,130 --> 01:43:01,330
The problem is if you've,

3877
01:43:01,510 --> 01:43:03,940
if you think about the
math for half a second,

3878
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:08,320
if there's this one group of people who
don't have a very high risk for murder

3879
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:09,790
or serious violence,

3880
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:10,211
who,

3881
01:43:10,211 --> 01:43:11,470
because they're not using,

3882
01:43:11,471 --> 01:43:12,750
because they are on antipsychotics,

3883
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:18,130
it means that the excess risk in the
people who are using and who's untrue

3884
01:43:18,131 --> 01:43:19,540
psychosis is untreated.

3885
01:43:19,870 --> 01:43:22,060
It must be spectacularly high.

3886
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:24,310
And the numbers bear that out.

3887
01:43:24,850 --> 01:43:25,540
So,

3888
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:28,120
so there's a really good
study from last year,

3889
01:43:28,121 --> 01:43:30,760
2018 it's small group of patients in,

3890
01:43:30,761 --> 01:43:31,270
um,

3891
01:43:31,270 --> 01:43:32,103
in Switzerland.

3892
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:34,870
Switzerland is a safe country
as a low base crime rate,

3893
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:40,000
but 50% of the people who were using
cannabis and had psychosis over a three

3894
01:43:40,001 --> 01:43:43,090
year period committed violence
in that group of people.

3895
01:43:43,091 --> 01:43:44,620
That's mostly twentysomething men.

3896
01:43:45,130 --> 01:43:45,460
Well,

3897
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:45,701
you know,

3898
01:43:45,701 --> 01:43:46,051
there's,

3899
01:43:46,051 --> 01:43:48,270
there's a study here and
I just sent it to uh,

3900
01:43:48,370 --> 01:43:49,270
Jamie and it's,

3901
01:43:49,570 --> 01:43:50,403
it's titled,

3902
01:43:50,410 --> 01:43:51,050
um,

3903
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:52,010
risk factors for

3904
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:53,120
violence in psychosis,

3905
01:43:53,390 --> 01:43:57,020
a systemic review and Meta
analysis of 110 studies.

3906
01:43:57,350 --> 01:43:57,770
So,

3907
01:43:57,770 --> 01:43:58,070
you know,

3908
01:43:58,070 --> 01:43:59,660
that's quite a few studies.

3909
01:43:59,661 --> 01:43:59,931
Okay.

3910
01:43:59,931 --> 01:44:00,590
So,

3911
01:44:00,590 --> 01:44:01,160
um,

3912
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:01,401
you know,

3913
01:44:01,401 --> 01:44:01,940
let me just,

3914
01:44:01,940 --> 01:44:04,040
just read a part of it out too.

3915
01:44:04,490 --> 01:44:07,880
So if violence was strongly associated
with a history of polysubstance abuse,

3916
01:44:07,881 --> 01:44:09,230
strongly associated with diagnosis,

3917
01:44:09,250 --> 01:44:13,610
cooperated substance use disorder and
recent substance misuse and moderately

3918
01:44:13,630 --> 01:44:14,463
associated with it,

3919
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:16,160
history of alcohol misuse,

3920
01:44:16,730 --> 01:44:18,350
a history of substance misuse,

3921
01:44:18,650 --> 01:44:19,220
uh,

3922
01:44:19,220 --> 01:44:20,720
recent alcohol misuse,

3923
01:44:20,930 --> 01:44:22,100
recent drug misuse,

3924
01:44:22,101 --> 01:44:23,450
and a history of drug abuse.

3925
01:44:23,660 --> 01:44:28,660
It was on clear if there
was an association between
violence and history of

3926
01:44:29,001 --> 01:44:30,050
cannabis misuse.

3927
01:44:30,170 --> 01:44:31,100
So again,

3928
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:33,620
this is 110 studies.

3929
01:44:33,790 --> 01:44:34,080
Uh,

3930
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:38,780
they very carefully looked at all of the
different risk factors as to what could

3931
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:39,681
trigger violence.

3932
01:44:39,681 --> 01:44:42,260
Just let me finish aocs
and what they said,

3933
01:44:42,261 --> 01:44:42,890
again,

3934
01:44:42,890 --> 01:44:47,840
it was unclear if there was an association
between violence and a history of

3935
01:44:47,841 --> 01:44:48,920
cannabis misuse.

3936
01:44:49,070 --> 01:44:49,251
Right?

3937
01:44:49,251 --> 01:44:51,110
So that's 110 studies.

3938
01:44:51,111 --> 01:44:55,040
So cannabis use in there is going to
get locked in with polysubstance use

3939
01:44:55,530 --> 01:44:56,510
because a lot of people will use,

3940
01:44:56,511 --> 01:44:57,830
are going to be using other drugs.

3941
01:44:58,260 --> 01:45:00,260
Poly substance means multiple substances,

3942
01:45:00,261 --> 01:45:00,831
alcohol,

3943
01:45:00,831 --> 01:45:01,664
cannabis,

3944
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:02,541
exactly.

3945
01:45:02,541 --> 01:45:03,080
So on.

3946
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:07,400
Everything else was found to have
significant statistical significance.

3947
01:45:07,430 --> 01:45:08,210
And I have not,

3948
01:45:08,210 --> 01:45:10,880
not just mine that a
doctor heard assignment.

3949
01:45:10,881 --> 01:45:13,730
I'd like to look at it
without looking at it.

3950
01:45:13,731 --> 01:45:16,670
I can't push back as hard as I would like.

3951
01:45:16,940 --> 01:45:21,940
What I can tell you is that I have
many studies in the book that show that

3952
01:45:22,401 --> 01:45:26,420
cannabis use is associated with
violence in people with psychosis.

3953
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:27,020
Okay.

3954
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:28,700
And more broadly,

3955
01:45:28,820 --> 01:45:32,960
it's associated with violence in the
general population in large studies,

3956
01:45:32,990 --> 01:45:37,880
in studies of high school students and
bullying in studies of people who were

3957
01:45:37,881 --> 01:45:39,920
vacationing in a visa in,

3958
01:45:40,130 --> 01:45:40,550
in,

3959
01:45:40,550 --> 01:45:44,390
in studies of young men
in China and the UK.

3960
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:48,290
There are big studies out there that
show cannabis use is associated with

3961
01:45:48,291 --> 01:45:49,124
violence.

3962
01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:50,750
Uh,

3963
01:45:50,750 --> 01:45:52,100
Beazer Ibiza

3964
01:45:56,760 --> 01:46:00,710
and I got grilled over there for that.

3965
01:46:00,790 --> 01:46:01,623
They get manager,

3966
01:46:01,950 --> 01:46:04,240
I suppose to kill people just said it.

3967
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:04,571
Yeah.

3968
01:46:04,571 --> 01:46:08,230
So some dignitary or
royal person had a list,

3969
01:46:08,380 --> 01:46:08,681
right?

3970
01:46:08,681 --> 01:46:10,160
Isn't that how it all starts at true?

3971
01:46:10,210 --> 01:46:10,550
Yeah.

3972
01:46:10,550 --> 01:46:11,020
Yeah.

3973
01:46:11,020 --> 01:46:11,853
I believe so.

3974
01:46:12,010 --> 01:46:12,700
Noted.

3975
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:13,001
Yeah.

3976
01:46:13,001 --> 01:46:18,001
The way the people in Spain pronounce
words was directly affected by this one

3977
01:46:18,251 --> 01:46:19,084
person apparently.

3978
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:20,351
But,

3979
01:46:20,351 --> 01:46:21,184
um,

3980
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:21,881
so this,

3981
01:46:21,881 --> 01:46:22,121
uh,

3982
01:46:22,121 --> 01:46:22,420
these,

3983
01:46:22,420 --> 01:46:23,680
this correlation,

3984
01:46:24,050 --> 01:46:24,760
um,

3985
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:29,260
between people that have
schizophrenia and using cannabis,

3986
01:46:29,770 --> 01:46:31,030
how do you,

3987
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:33,810
is is schizophrenia a diagnosis?

3988
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:36,310
It's purely based on behavior basically.

3989
01:46:36,311 --> 01:46:36,630
Yes.

3990
01:46:36,630 --> 01:46:36,720
Yeah.

3991
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:37,361
It's a clinic.

3992
01:46:37,361 --> 01:46:39,460
There is no blood tests
and do a brain scan.

3993
01:46:39,490 --> 01:46:42,510
It's basically how you behave and what
you tell the doctor about how you're

3994
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:43,353
feeling.

3995
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:46,300
Charise or it's very subjective,

3996
01:46:46,301 --> 01:46:48,120
how so big because you're,

3997
01:46:48,121 --> 01:46:48,670
you're asking

3998
01:46:48,670 --> 01:46:50,520
skin someone basically
a series of questions.

3999
01:46:50,521 --> 01:46:50,731
I mean,

4000
01:46:50,731 --> 01:46:51,900
it's no different than,

4001
01:46:52,250 --> 01:46:52,980
you know,

4002
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:54,060
depression really.

4003
01:46:54,090 --> 01:46:54,430
I mean,

4004
01:46:54,430 --> 01:46:54,811
you just,

4005
01:46:54,811 --> 01:46:58,320
just asking someone a series of
questions and then based upon that,

4006
01:46:58,440 --> 01:46:58,771
uh,

4007
01:46:58,771 --> 01:47:00,030
which is very subjective,

4008
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:00,930
then you're going to make,

4009
01:47:00,950 --> 01:47:01,180
you know,

4010
01:47:01,180 --> 01:47:02,100
a clinical decision.

4011
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:04,110
Whereas when it's like a blood test,

4012
01:47:04,111 --> 01:47:05,050
like if someone you know,

4013
01:47:05,220 --> 01:47:05,851
passes,

4014
01:47:05,851 --> 01:47:06,210
uh,

4015
01:47:06,210 --> 01:47:06,600
you know,

4016
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:07,710
a certain amount of,

4017
01:47:07,711 --> 01:47:08,910
of hemoglobin a one C,

4018
01:47:08,911 --> 01:47:09,060
you know,

4019
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:10,500
depending on which
chart you're looking at,

4020
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:13,260
then you're going to call that
person prediabetic or diabetic.

4021
01:47:13,261 --> 01:47:13,610
But,

4022
01:47:13,610 --> 01:47:13,800
you know,

4023
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:16,560
unfortunately we just don't have
those objective measurements.

4024
01:47:16,561 --> 01:47:17,071
And again,

4025
01:47:17,071 --> 01:47:17,850
that's why,

4026
01:47:17,850 --> 01:47:18,151
you know,

4027
01:47:18,151 --> 01:47:19,650
Alex was saying earlier that,

4028
01:47:19,890 --> 01:47:20,610
um,

4029
01:47:20,610 --> 01:47:20,791
that,

4030
01:47:20,791 --> 01:47:21,000
you know,

4031
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:21,241
the,

4032
01:47:21,241 --> 01:47:21,331
uh,

4033
01:47:21,331 --> 01:47:22,350
they couldn't really figure out,

4034
01:47:22,351 --> 01:47:22,501
you know,

4035
01:47:22,501 --> 01:47:25,200
how many people in the United
States had had schizophrenia.

4036
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:26,640
And I understand that,

4037
01:47:26,641 --> 01:47:28,350
but at the same time too,

4038
01:47:28,351 --> 01:47:28,770
I mean,

4039
01:47:28,770 --> 01:47:30,300
it's okay to,

4040
01:47:30,301 --> 01:47:31,170
to adjust,

4041
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:31,561
you know,

4042
01:47:31,561 --> 01:47:35,880
the way that you diagnose someone over
the course of the years and you learn

4043
01:47:35,881 --> 01:47:36,714
things because,

4044
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:36,961
you know,

4045
01:47:36,961 --> 01:47:41,580
you could easily say that almost
everyone has some type of mental illness.

4046
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:42,210
And I mean,

4047
01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:43,800
people should understand that,

4048
01:47:44,090 --> 01:47:44,250
you know,

4049
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:46,830
there's seven different
basic human emotions.

4050
01:47:46,831 --> 01:47:46,951
You know,

4051
01:47:46,951 --> 01:47:47,641
I've talked to is for,

4052
01:47:47,641 --> 01:47:48,000
it's,

4053
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:48,271
there's,

4054
01:47:48,271 --> 01:47:49,104
there's anger,

4055
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:50,033
there's contempt,

4056
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:50,660
uh,

4057
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:51,030
there's,

4058
01:47:51,030 --> 01:47:52,020
there's discuss,

4059
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:52,890
there's fear,

4060
01:47:52,890 --> 01:47:53,491
sadness,

4061
01:47:53,491 --> 01:47:54,360
surprise and happiness.

4062
01:47:54,361 --> 01:47:54,811
That's seven.

4063
01:47:54,811 --> 01:47:55,470
So,

4064
01:47:55,470 --> 01:47:55,651
you know,

4065
01:47:55,651 --> 01:47:57,990
depending on which way surprise goes.

4066
01:47:58,170 --> 01:47:58,471
I mean,

4067
01:47:58,471 --> 01:48:01,140
six out of those seven are negative,

4068
01:48:01,170 --> 01:48:01,411
right?

4069
01:48:01,411 --> 01:48:04,680
Because we're wired to
basically detect threats.

4070
01:48:04,890 --> 01:48:05,430
So,

4071
01:48:05,430 --> 01:48:06,020
you know,

4072
01:48:06,020 --> 01:48:06,490
um,

4073
01:48:06,490 --> 01:48:06,650
we're,

4074
01:48:06,650 --> 01:48:06,800
we're,

4075
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:06,971
we're,

4076
01:48:06,971 --> 01:48:07,681
we're making,

4077
01:48:07,681 --> 01:48:07,891
you know,

4078
01:48:07,891 --> 01:48:08,071
the,

4079
01:48:08,071 --> 01:48:09,060
all these diagnosis,

4080
01:48:09,061 --> 01:48:11,030
I think we have to be
careful because you have,

4081
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:13,380
some people are calling themselves
depressed and some people are calling

4082
01:48:13,381 --> 01:48:15,090
themselves anxious when really,

4083
01:48:15,091 --> 01:48:15,300
you know,

4084
01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:20,280
they're just not dealing with basic human
emotions that they need to understand

4085
01:48:20,281 --> 01:48:21,330
and need to deal with.

4086
01:48:21,540 --> 01:48:25,230
Like people are getting angry about
being angry or like depressed about being

4087
01:48:25,231 --> 01:48:26,064
depressed.

4088
01:48:26,090 --> 01:48:29,550
Like if you feel one of these emotions
just kind of sit with it and just kind of

4089
01:48:29,551 --> 01:48:30,384
reflect on it.

4090
01:48:30,390 --> 01:48:31,230
And I think you know,

4091
01:48:31,290 --> 01:48:32,101
that that's a much,

4092
01:48:32,101 --> 01:48:35,010
much better way to kind of kind
of tea to tease things out.

4093
01:48:35,250 --> 01:48:37,560
But you want to come back
to my original point.

4094
01:48:37,561 --> 01:48:38,340
I think that,

4095
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:38,521
you know,

4096
01:48:38,521 --> 01:48:41,310
more people are understanding that um,

4097
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:41,551
you know,

4098
01:48:41,551 --> 01:48:45,090
we don't just need to give out a pill for
everything and that everyone shouldn't

4099
01:48:45,091 --> 01:48:49,320
just be labeled as having a mental health
diagnosis because if things just keep

4100
01:48:49,650 --> 01:48:50,640
going the way they are,

4101
01:48:50,850 --> 01:48:51,683
you know what's,

4102
01:48:51,700 --> 01:48:55,110
by 2040 it's going to be like 50% of
people are going to have like a mental

4103
01:48:55,111 --> 01:48:55,830
health disorder.

4104
01:48:55,830 --> 01:48:58,530
So like people just need to
understand that life is hard.

4105
01:48:58,590 --> 01:48:59,820
You got to deal with these emotions.

4106
01:48:59,821 --> 01:49:01,680
Sometimes it's not that big of a deal.

4107
01:49:01,681 --> 01:49:03,820
And that's why for some fun
and that's what some folks,

4108
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:04,501
for some folks,

4109
01:49:04,501 --> 01:49:06,040
and that's why I'm such a big thing of,

4110
01:49:06,041 --> 01:49:08,460
of Jordan Peterson because you know he's,

4111
01:49:08,790 --> 01:49:09,061
he's,

4112
01:49:09,061 --> 01:49:10,470
he's kind of tough on people.

4113
01:49:10,910 --> 01:49:11,640
Don't let me stop.

4114
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:11,880
Sure.

4115
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:15,590
Cause Jordan Peterson was
on Ssri is for years we got,

4116
01:49:16,210 --> 01:49:17,500
it was a long,

4117
01:49:17,501 --> 01:49:19,690
long time like for a long,

4118
01:49:19,691 --> 01:49:21,400
long time as was his family.

4119
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:26,720
And what's crazy about him is what got
him off is a carnivore diet elimination

4120
01:49:27,131 --> 01:49:31,980
diet where he only eats meat with salt
and drinks water and the healthier than

4121
01:49:31,981 --> 01:49:32,860
he's ever been in his life.

4122
01:49:33,130 --> 01:49:37,000
And that is another massively
controversial subject.

4123
01:49:37,810 --> 01:49:41,740
Let me push back a little
bit cause I think people,

4124
01:49:41,930 --> 01:49:42,700
you know,

4125
01:49:42,700 --> 01:49:44,710
as controversial as the
book has been about,

4126
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:45,120
uh,

4127
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:46,900
about cannabis in psychosis,

4128
01:49:46,901 --> 01:49:48,040
this issue is even

4129
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,030
more controversial.

4130
01:49:49,060 --> 01:49:50,380
And obviously for,

4131
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:51,640
for for a fair number of people,

4132
01:49:51,641 --> 01:49:52,810
it doesn't really,

4133
01:49:53,170 --> 01:49:54,500
it doesn't sync with the stereotype.

4134
01:49:54,501 --> 01:49:55,070
It doesn't say,

4135
01:49:55,070 --> 01:49:57,490
it doesn't say with how they've
experienced cannabis use.

4136
01:49:57,500 --> 01:49:58,060
Right.

4137
01:49:58,060 --> 01:49:58,691
So I think,

4138
01:49:58,691 --> 01:50:02,320
I think alcohol's a really
interesting comparison.

4139
01:50:02,620 --> 01:50:02,990
Sorry.

4140
01:50:02,990 --> 01:50:03,823
Um,

4141
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:05,720
I'm the Canadian.

4142
01:50:06,050 --> 01:50:06,910
Um,

4143
01:50:08,210 --> 01:50:09,460
well you have to go national.

4144
01:50:11,050 --> 01:50:11,801
We were talking about,

4145
01:50:11,801 --> 01:50:13,240
my wife's actually from new family,

4146
01:50:14,930 --> 01:50:17,910
new familiar as in understand marijuana.

4147
01:50:19,350 --> 01:50:22,870
A Newfoundland trained myself to say
that what you're telling me I'm wrong.

4148
01:50:23,390 --> 01:50:24,590
Liquid Jamie just pulled up.

4149
01:50:24,930 --> 01:50:27,770
While marijuana use
increases violent behavior,

4150
01:50:27,771 --> 01:50:32,630
50 year study finds casual link
between cannabis and subsequent violent

4151
01:50:32,631 --> 01:50:33,464
behavior.

4152
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:38,390
A new research published online in
advance of print of the journal.

4153
01:50:38,391 --> 01:50:40,460
It's like a psychological
medicine concludes.

4154
01:50:40,461 --> 01:50:44,270
The continued use of cannabis causes
violent behavior as a direct result of

4155
01:50:44,271 --> 01:50:47,180
changes in brain function that
are caused by smoking weed.

4156
01:50:47,181 --> 01:50:48,020
Over many years,

4157
01:50:48,350 --> 01:50:52,070
researchers have long debated a possible
link between the use of marijuana and

4158
01:50:52,071 --> 01:50:54,230
violent crime in contrast to alcohol,

4159
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:54,711
meth,

4160
01:50:54,711 --> 01:50:56,060
and many other illegal drugs.

4161
01:50:56,061 --> 01:51:00,110
The metabolic effects of cannabis scene
unsuited to promoting violent behavior.

4162
01:51:00,111 --> 01:51:00,531
However,

4163
01:51:00,531 --> 01:51:01,280
ample,

4164
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:05,810
ample previous research
has linked marijuana use to
increased violent behavior.

4165
01:51:05,811 --> 01:51:10,310
The sticky problem in such studies
are that many confounding factors,

4166
01:51:10,311 --> 01:51:11,390
cofounding factors,

4167
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:12,021
uh,

4168
01:51:12,021 --> 01:51:14,530
involved in interpreting this correlation.

4169
01:51:14,870 --> 01:51:15,580
So,

4170
01:51:15,580 --> 01:51:16,200
so,

4171
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:16,790
so,

4172
01:51:16,790 --> 01:51:17,420
okay.

4173
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:20,660
It is very difficult to determine whether
or not any statistical correlation

4174
01:51:20,661 --> 01:51:22,790
between marijuana use
and violent behavior are,

4175
01:51:23,230 --> 01:51:23,750
uh,

4176
01:51:23,750 --> 01:51:28,750
cash causally linked or
instead the two associated,

4177
01:51:29,060 --> 01:51:29,750
uh,

4178
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:33,710
or instead the two are associated
through some other factors such as

4179
01:51:33,711 --> 01:51:35,000
socioeconomic status,

4180
01:51:35,001 --> 01:51:38,600
personality traits are many
other variables that are
related to the propensity

4181
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:39,740
to use marijuana.

4182
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:40,850
Um,

4183
01:51:40,850 --> 01:51:43,140
so I think it's a fairly good summary of,

4184
01:51:43,230 --> 01:51:43,790
of,

4185
01:51:43,790 --> 01:51:44,623
of the issues.

4186
01:51:44,650 --> 01:51:44,961
What's up.

4187
01:51:44,961 --> 01:51:45,990
James Study

4188
01:51:45,990 --> 01:51:50,990
came from a 411 boys who
were born in 1953 in London,

4189
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:54,330
97% of which were Caucasian.

4190
01:51:54,810 --> 01:51:56,880
And all of them are raised
in two parent households.

4191
01:51:57,060 --> 01:51:57,690
So,

4192
01:51:57,690 --> 01:51:58,251
so you know,

4193
01:51:58,251 --> 01:52:01,590
so those people are relatively
stable if they're two family,

4194
01:52:01,650 --> 01:52:03,530
two parent households to
hand parents beat to shit.

4195
01:52:03,531 --> 01:52:04,280
And Dad's also,

4196
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:04,650
no,

4197
01:52:04,650 --> 01:52:05,440
it's possible.

4198
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:05,910
But so,

4199
01:52:05,910 --> 01:52:07,110
so let me so,

4200
01:52:07,310 --> 01:52:07,780
so,

4201
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:11,610
so I think the alcohol comparison is again
a good one because anybody who's ever

4202
01:52:11,611 --> 01:52:16,320
been in a bar at 9:00 PM and gone back
at 2:00 AM knows that alcohol does

4203
01:52:16,321 --> 01:52:17,070
inhibits people.

4204
01:52:17,070 --> 01:52:17,461
Right.

4205
01:52:17,461 --> 01:52:18,510
It causes fights,

4206
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:19,240
right.

4207
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:20,730
It makes people loud.

4208
01:52:20,731 --> 01:52:22,660
It makes a lot of fucking does.

4209
01:52:23,080 --> 01:52:23,913
Does

4210
01:52:25,140 --> 01:52:26,310
it's good and bad.

4211
01:52:26,730 --> 01:52:27,660
I don't know if that's good.

4212
01:52:27,661 --> 01:52:28,494
I mean,

4213
01:52:28,830 --> 01:52:30,480
sometimes it makes people,

4214
01:52:30,750 --> 01:52:32,700
it's alcohol and sex are a terrible idea.

4215
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:35,850
It certainly causes some sexual violence.

4216
01:52:35,851 --> 01:52:36,610
Sure.

4217
01:52:36,610 --> 01:52:37,440
Okay.

4218
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:38,640
But at the same time,

4219
01:52:38,730 --> 01:52:40,830
everybody knows that you can have a drink.

4220
01:52:41,010 --> 01:52:41,311
You know,

4221
01:52:41,311 --> 01:52:43,050
you can have a beer at
the backyard barbecue,

4222
01:52:43,051 --> 01:52:44,590
you can enter.

4223
01:52:45,290 --> 01:52:45,980
It doesn't mean

4224
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:48,320
that you're going to get in a fight
and you actually might enhance your

4225
01:52:48,321 --> 01:52:49,340
conversation,

4226
01:52:49,370 --> 01:52:50,420
social lubricants,

4227
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:51,313
all that good stuff,

4228
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:52,190
good stuff.

4229
01:52:52,190 --> 01:52:53,630
And you might even know people.

4230
01:52:53,631 --> 01:52:53,841
I mean,

4231
01:52:53,841 --> 01:52:56,660
I do know people who I would say
have a problem with drinking.

4232
01:52:56,690 --> 01:52:56,961
Okay.

4233
01:52:56,961 --> 01:53:00,050
But it's mostly they're sitting
at home drinking scotch,

4234
01:53:00,051 --> 01:53:02,750
watching baseball until
they fall asleep that night.

4235
01:53:02,780 --> 01:53:05,210
Now that's obviously not a
healthy way to use alcohol,

4236
01:53:05,300 --> 01:53:06,620
but it doesn't make them violent.

4237
01:53:06,980 --> 01:53:11,600
But we know on a population basis
that alcohol causes violence.

4238
01:53:11,630 --> 01:53:12,920
It causes drunk driving,

4239
01:53:12,921 --> 01:53:14,300
it causes problems.

4240
01:53:14,570 --> 01:53:17,180
And it said that in this
study that I quoted earlier,

4241
01:53:17,181 --> 01:53:17,621
but it's,

4242
01:53:17,621 --> 01:53:18,060
it's a,

4243
01:53:18,060 --> 01:53:18,980
that alcohol,

4244
01:53:19,010 --> 01:53:19,580
again,

4245
01:53:19,580 --> 01:53:21,530
they didn't their soy cannabis,

4246
01:53:21,590 --> 01:53:22,400
they weren't sure.

4247
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:22,611
Right?

4248
01:53:22,611 --> 01:53:22,761
So,

4249
01:53:22,761 --> 01:53:23,001
okay.

4250
01:53:23,001 --> 01:53:24,290
But so this is again,

4251
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:27,680
I would like to read the paper that
you're quoting from because I have so much

4252
01:53:27,710 --> 01:53:28,580
other research,

4253
01:53:28,820 --> 01:53:29,360
but here's,

4254
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:30,890
here's what I'm saying about cannabis.

4255
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:31,753
Okay.

4256
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:33,350
Cannabis for a lot of people.

4257
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:33,651
Yeah.

4258
01:53:33,651 --> 01:53:34,700
They can just smoke it.

4259
01:53:34,701 --> 01:53:35,241
And as people,

4260
01:53:35,241 --> 01:53:35,451
you know,

4261
01:53:35,451 --> 01:53:36,920
as many people have tweeted at me,

4262
01:53:36,921 --> 01:53:39,320
the only thing I attacked
was a bowl of Nachos.

4263
01:53:39,350 --> 01:53:40,160
Right.

4264
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:42,420
And so and so that's true for some people,

4265
01:53:42,440 --> 01:53:44,090
but that could be sent
with the alcohol as well.

4266
01:53:44,091 --> 01:53:45,520
That's exactly logical variable.

4267
01:53:45,521 --> 01:53:47,420
And there's so many studies that say that,

4268
01:53:47,490 --> 01:53:50,040
that the cannabis laws have
actually decreased crime.

4269
01:53:50,250 --> 01:53:51,420
Looking at studying.

4270
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:53,241
She gotta.

4271
01:53:53,241 --> 01:53:53,870
Let me finish.

4272
01:53:53,870 --> 01:53:54,441
Let me finish.

4273
01:53:54,441 --> 01:53:55,190
Let him finish.

4274
01:53:55,190 --> 01:53:56,023
Go ahead.

4275
01:53:56,420 --> 01:53:57,140
So,

4276
01:53:57,140 --> 01:53:57,973
so

4277
01:53:59,150 --> 01:54:01,400
even though for many people,

4278
01:54:01,430 --> 01:54:03,320
cannabis isn't going to cause violence,

4279
01:54:03,350 --> 01:54:07,160
that doesn't mean it can't cause
violence in some people especially,

4280
01:54:07,161 --> 01:54:09,350
or at least could be affected
at least could be a factor,

4281
01:54:09,380 --> 01:54:12,470
especially with the kind of
violence that I am talking about.

4282
01:54:12,471 --> 01:54:14,060
And then I write about in the book,

4283
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:15,051
which is again,

4284
01:54:15,051 --> 01:54:16,040
so alcohol,

4285
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:17,331
it may be,

4286
01:54:17,331 --> 01:54:19,220
makes argument into a brawl.

4287
01:54:19,250 --> 01:54:21,890
It makes a brawl into something
where somebody picks up a stick.

4288
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:24,650
It makes that into something
where somebody pulls out a knife,

4289
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:25,513
it escalates.

4290
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:27,260
Cannabis is different.

4291
01:54:27,470 --> 01:54:30,380
Cannabis Causes Paranoia and psychosis.

4292
01:54:30,470 --> 01:54:32,600
And it certainly causes
us things temporarily,

4293
01:54:32,601 --> 01:54:34,070
even if it doesn't cause them permanently.

4294
01:54:34,071 --> 01:54:38,180
So a distortion in reality that could
lead to you doing something terrible.

4295
01:54:38,181 --> 01:54:41,630
And it's usually to somebody
you're not actually fighting with.

4296
01:54:41,870 --> 01:54:43,010
It's a family member.

4297
01:54:43,410 --> 01:54:44,900
The worst cases that I've,

4298
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:49,640
and I've really seen a lot of these cases
are basically innocent family members

4299
01:54:49,820 --> 01:54:50,990
who are just in the way.

4300
01:54:50,991 --> 01:54:55,940
When somebody loses touch with reality
and literally thinks like this,

4301
01:54:56,150 --> 01:54:59,060
my 85 year old grandmother
is going to kill me,

4302
01:54:59,120 --> 01:55:01,370
so I better stab her to death first.

4303
01:55:01,670 --> 01:55:02,690
That happens.

4304
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:04,400
It happens a lot.

4305
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:08,480
And if you look at the amount of violence
that people with psychosis command on

4306
01:55:08,481 --> 01:55:10,130
a population level basis,

4307
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:14,810
it looks like people with schizophrenia
commit about six to 10% of all the

4308
01:55:14,811 --> 01:55:18,200
murders in this country and it looks
like people would sort of broader diff,

4309
01:55:18,230 --> 01:55:19,700
more broadly defined psychosis.

4310
01:55:19,701 --> 01:55:19,941
Again,

4311
01:55:19,941 --> 01:55:21,530
bipolar with psychosis,

4312
01:55:21,590 --> 01:55:22,790
other psychotic conditions,

4313
01:55:22,791 --> 01:55:23,960
temporary psychosis,

4314
01:55:24,260 --> 01:55:28,820
they might be responsible for as much as
20% of the violent crime in the United

4315
01:55:28,820 --> 01:55:28,821
States.

4316
01:55:28,821 --> 01:55:30,560
That's a lot of violent crime.

4317
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:35,780
And what I am saying is that it is
quite clear that drug use mediates that

4318
01:55:35,781 --> 01:55:36,500
violent crime.

4319
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:36,860
In other words,

4320
01:55:36,860 --> 01:55:38,120
if you're not using,

4321
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:40,280
you can keep your impulses in check,

4322
01:55:40,490 --> 01:55:41,720
but when you do use,

4323
01:55:41,900 --> 01:55:43,440
you become dangerous.

4324
01:55:43,441 --> 01:55:43,980
So when

4325
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:45,990
we're talking about
biological variability,

4326
01:55:45,991 --> 01:55:47,670
if we factor in schizophrenia,

4327
01:55:47,730 --> 01:55:50,700
essentially what you're saying is that
there are people that have schizophrenia

4328
01:55:50,701 --> 01:55:52,320
that don't commit violence,

4329
01:55:52,590 --> 01:55:57,300
but that they're much more likely to
commit violence if you add some sort of

4330
01:55:57,301 --> 01:55:58,380
psych medication,

4331
01:55:58,381 --> 01:55:59,460
whether it's marijuana,

4332
01:55:59,461 --> 01:56:00,360
whether it's something else,

4333
01:56:00,361 --> 01:56:02,040
it perturbs reality for them.

4334
01:56:02,041 --> 01:56:04,630
And particularly marijuana
because hotbox bring down the

4335
01:56:06,750 --> 01:56:07,880
recreational drugs,

4336
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:11,640
the worst cases of all our
cannabis and a stimulant.

4337
01:56:11,970 --> 01:56:14,640
Because to the they both
like cocaine or meth.

4338
01:56:14,670 --> 01:56:15,181
Exactly.

4339
01:56:15,181 --> 01:56:15,480
Yeah.

4340
01:56:15,480 --> 01:56:16,320
So when you get that,

4341
01:56:16,321 --> 01:56:20,880
you get paranoid from two sources and you
get the only good thing about cannabis

4342
01:56:20,881 --> 01:56:23,100
from this point of view as it kind
of knocks people down a little bit,

4343
01:56:23,101 --> 01:56:24,750
but meth brings them right back.

4344
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:29,370
So is it fair to say that what we don't
know is that we don't know whether or

4345
01:56:29,371 --> 01:56:33,000
not these people like this young band
with his terrible story from Connecticut?

4346
01:56:33,030 --> 01:56:33,360
Yes.

4347
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:38,360
We don't know whether or not he would
have become a schizophrenia and exhibited

4348
01:56:38,521 --> 01:56:40,170
those symptoms without the marijuana.

4349
01:56:40,171 --> 01:56:40,920
We really don't know.

4350
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:42,330
But we do know he did with it.

4351
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:42,741
That's,

4352
01:56:42,741 --> 01:56:43,440
that's correct.

4353
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:46,200
And what I would also say is
that for somebody like that,

4354
01:56:46,201 --> 01:56:49,770
and this is quite clear on a
population level basis with people with

4355
01:56:49,771 --> 01:56:52,110
schizophrenia is you've got
to discourage them from using,

4356
01:56:52,540 --> 01:56:55,110
really have to be disclosed
because it brings out the worst.

4357
01:56:55,170 --> 01:56:55,850
Right.

4358
01:56:55,850 --> 01:56:56,120
And,

4359
01:56:56,120 --> 01:56:57,150
and you know somebody said this,

4360
01:56:57,160 --> 01:56:58,230
a a friend of mine,

4361
01:56:58,530 --> 01:56:59,970
old friend of mine from
the New York Times said,

4362
01:57:00,210 --> 01:57:02,340
so every time there's a hurricane people,

4363
01:57:02,370 --> 01:57:03,600
some people on the right say,

4364
01:57:03,601 --> 01:57:07,200
well you can't prove that global warming
cause that one hurricane that would've

4365
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:08,730
happened anyway and he and there,

4366
01:57:08,731 --> 01:57:09,060
right,

4367
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:13,800
you can't prove it and you can't prove
that any one case of psychosis was caused

4368
01:57:13,801 --> 01:57:14,634
by marijuana.

4369
01:57:14,730 --> 01:57:18,240
But when you look at the big studies
at the population level data,

4370
01:57:18,241 --> 01:57:22,800
the association is really clear and
everything points the same way and the

4371
01:57:22,801 --> 01:57:24,810
synthetic cannabinoids k two and spice,

4372
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:29,490
those can clearly produce psychosis in
people and people with psychosis tend to

4373
01:57:29,491 --> 01:57:33,150
slip back into it if they use at some
point you got to start to say to yourself,

4374
01:57:33,151 --> 01:57:35,010
why does everything go the same way?

4375
01:57:35,670 --> 01:57:38,670
I also have a personal friend and I'd
really didn't think about this guy,

4376
01:57:38,671 --> 01:57:41,370
but there's another personal friend
that I know that it is a martial arts

4377
01:57:41,371 --> 01:57:43,830
instructor that had a psychotic break.

4378
01:57:44,100 --> 01:57:47,460
He became schizophrenia and
he's a regular marijuana user.

4379
01:57:47,461 --> 01:57:50,130
And the people around him
associated that with that.

4380
01:57:50,131 --> 01:57:53,340
And in fact people that
are regular cannabis users,

4381
01:57:53,341 --> 01:57:57,780
we're trying to get them to stop using
marijuana or close to being on the edge.

4382
01:57:57,810 --> 01:58:01,350
Any use a little bit of of
cannabis for sure it be Tyson.

4383
01:58:01,370 --> 01:58:03,900
And this guy was not on
the edge when I knew him,

4384
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:05,610
when I knew him,

4385
01:58:05,611 --> 01:58:06,660
he was very rational,

4386
01:58:06,720 --> 01:58:07,381
very rational.

4387
01:58:07,381 --> 01:58:09,960
But something happened
somewhere along the line was he,

4388
01:58:10,090 --> 01:58:12,180
did he become a pretty
heavy smoker over time?

4389
01:58:12,210 --> 01:58:15,000
I do not know because we don't
live in the same area anymore,

4390
01:58:15,210 --> 01:58:17,910
but he got really heavily,

4391
01:58:17,970 --> 01:58:18,510
uh,

4392
01:58:18,510 --> 01:58:22,710
really heavily medicated and did some
really crazy shit and want to be in

4393
01:58:22,711 --> 01:58:23,544
hospitalized.

4394
01:58:23,790 --> 01:58:25,560
And this was not the case before.

4395
01:58:25,561 --> 01:58:25,831
I mean,

4396
01:58:25,831 --> 01:58:27,990
whatever it was that triggered him.

4397
01:58:28,020 --> 01:58:28,853
I mean,

4398
01:58:28,860 --> 01:58:30,930
when I was around him when he was younger,

4399
01:58:30,931 --> 01:58:32,790
I would have said he's a total normal guy.

4400
01:58:32,791 --> 01:58:34,260
And I would have never saw that coming.

4401
01:58:34,650 --> 01:58:36,420
He was a heavy marijuana user,

4402
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:36,990
heavy,

4403
01:58:36,990 --> 01:58:37,500
heavy.

4404
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:37,911
But I don't,

4405
01:58:37,911 --> 01:58:38,910
I don't know how he's doing now.

4406
01:58:38,911 --> 01:58:39,691
I hope he's okay.

4407
01:58:39,691 --> 01:58:40,230
But we're,

4408
01:58:40,230 --> 01:58:40,470
you know,

4409
01:58:40,470 --> 01:58:41,740
we have mutual friends.

4410
01:58:41,930 --> 01:58:42,280
Yeah.

4411
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:42,940
And uh,

4412
01:58:42,940 --> 01:58:44,770
he became,

4413
01:58:44,790 --> 01:58:44,891
uh,

4414
01:58:44,891 --> 01:58:46,270
schizophrenia and,

4415
01:58:46,271 --> 01:58:46,811
and you know,

4416
01:58:46,811 --> 01:58:47,710
you will see,

4417
01:58:47,740 --> 01:58:48,000
you know,

4418
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,390
cases like that.

4419
01:58:49,391 --> 01:58:49,970
But you know,

4420
01:58:49,970 --> 01:58:52,870
when you do look at a lot
of the larger data on,

4421
01:58:52,930 --> 01:58:54,280
on cannabis and violence,

4422
01:58:54,281 --> 01:58:55,300
I mean it's just,

4423
01:58:55,330 --> 01:58:56,410
it's just not there.

4424
01:58:56,411 --> 01:58:58,420
Like there's lots of
data that suggests that,

4425
01:58:58,600 --> 01:58:58,810
you know,

4426
01:58:58,810 --> 01:59:00,760
medical marijuana laws for example,

4427
01:59:00,761 --> 01:59:03,560
can actually have a decrease in overall.

4428
01:59:04,550 --> 01:59:04,880
I mean,

4429
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:08,860
I think there's a study that says that
no comfort to the people who lose their

4430
01:59:08,861 --> 01:59:11,020
children because of the psychotropics.

4431
01:59:11,140 --> 01:59:11,530
That's right.

4432
01:59:11,530 --> 01:59:13,240
And those studies are really bad.

4433
01:59:13,241 --> 01:59:15,580
So the place that you can
criticize the bad though,

4434
01:59:15,610 --> 01:59:16,330
because there,

4435
01:59:16,330 --> 01:59:17,800
because state level data is not great.

4436
01:59:17,801 --> 01:59:19,920
The place the book has
been criticized for Andra,

4437
01:59:19,990 --> 01:59:22,210
there was a rand review though in 2013.

4438
01:59:22,211 --> 01:59:22,731
And I mean that,

4439
01:59:22,731 --> 01:59:27,731
that's again that stated that include
marijuana use does not induce violent

4440
01:59:28,031 --> 01:59:32,870
crime and the links between marijuana
use and property crime are thin there.

4441
01:59:33,340 --> 01:59:37,060
I think we all agree that marijuana
use by itself with people that aren't

4442
01:59:37,061 --> 01:59:39,400
schizophrenia probably does
it induce violent crime.

4443
01:59:39,610 --> 01:59:42,790
But with people that are schizophrenia
or people where it triggers

4444
01:59:42,791 --> 01:59:43,451
schizophrenia,

4445
01:59:43,451 --> 01:59:45,940
it could potentially
induced violent crime.

4446
01:59:45,941 --> 01:59:47,320
My friend did not get violent,

4447
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:49,090
although he did do a violent thing.

4448
01:59:49,091 --> 01:59:50,110
It wasn't to a person.

4449
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:51,160
Um,

4450
01:59:51,160 --> 01:59:51,970
I think,

4451
01:59:51,970 --> 01:59:55,150
I think we have to be really
careful because there's no,

4452
01:59:55,240 --> 01:59:56,740
just like with diet,

4453
01:59:56,770 --> 01:59:59,500
just like with food and you know,

4454
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:00,850
like a allergies,

4455
02:00:00,851 --> 02:00:03,430
all these different variabilities
when it comes to human beings.

4456
02:00:03,790 --> 02:00:05,680
I think we have to be really,

4457
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:10,800
really careful about lumping all people
together when it comes to how they get

4458
02:00:11,141 --> 02:00:12,730
affected by various compounds.

4459
02:00:13,350 --> 02:00:14,500
So the state level,

4460
02:00:14,890 --> 02:00:15,371
if you want,

4461
02:00:15,371 --> 02:00:15,670
I'll,

4462
02:00:15,670 --> 02:00:16,280
I'll,

4463
02:00:16,280 --> 02:00:16,781
the police,

4464
02:00:16,781 --> 02:00:18,910
the book has been criticized in my mind,

4465
02:00:18,940 --> 02:00:23,140
sort of the most fairly is it points out
that in the four states that legalized

4466
02:00:23,141 --> 02:00:23,650
first,

4467
02:00:23,650 --> 02:00:24,730
which is Alaska,

4468
02:00:24,731 --> 02:00:25,450
Washington,

4469
02:00:25,450 --> 02:00:25,871
Oregon,

4470
02:00:25,871 --> 02:00:26,704
Colorado.

4471
02:00:26,940 --> 02:00:27,580
Um,

4472
02:00:27,580 --> 02:00:32,580
if you look at 2013 and then you compare
that to 2017 murders and agg assault,

4473
02:00:33,310 --> 02:00:34,210
violent crime,

4474
02:00:34,570 --> 02:00:35,050
um,

4475
02:00:35,050 --> 02:00:39,520
are up substantially in those states and
substantially more than in the u s can

4476
02:00:39,521 --> 02:00:40,240
I stop you there?

4477
02:00:40,240 --> 02:00:43,300
But is there a possibility there's a
correlation between organized crime?

4478
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:43,781
He goes,

4479
02:00:43,781 --> 02:00:47,350
one of the things about selling marijuana
is the people that have always been

4480
02:00:47,351 --> 02:00:48,880
selling marijuana have been criminals.

4481
02:00:49,150 --> 02:00:51,490
When you make things legal and estate,

4482
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:54,940
the people that were selling
it illegal flock to that state.

4483
02:00:54,941 --> 02:00:56,530
And that's been proven to be true,

4484
02:00:56,820 --> 02:00:57,310
that there's,

4485
02:00:57,310 --> 02:01:01,090
there's a direct correlation
between people being robbed,

4486
02:01:01,091 --> 02:01:05,590
that there was also a significant
problem with credit cards and banks where

4487
02:01:05,591 --> 02:01:08,250
everyone was having to do all
their transactions with cash.

4488
02:01:08,251 --> 02:01:12,250
There was a lot of violences
was associated with
marijuana in regards to that

4489
02:01:12,251 --> 02:01:15,220
and also massive increase in population.

4490
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:20,520
And so the reason why Trump has actually
not really against cannabis in some

4491
02:01:21,371 --> 02:01:25,960
ways it's because he feels that if
we have medical marijuana laws that

4492
02:01:25,990 --> 02:01:27,340
especially the states that are,

4493
02:01:27,370 --> 02:01:27,760
that,

4494
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:28,630
that are border states,

4495
02:01:28,810 --> 02:01:31,450
that the crime's gonna drop
drops a lot tremendously.

4496
02:01:31,630 --> 02:01:32,530
And it has dropped.

4497
02:01:32,531 --> 02:01:37,531
They did a study last year and it dropped
over 50% is all around 7% in Arizona.

4498
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:39,633
And then again,

4499
02:01:39,740 --> 02:01:41,210
you know Benjamin Hanson

4500
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:41,600
who,

4501
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:41,841
who's,

4502
02:01:41,841 --> 02:01:42,820
who's an economist,

4503
02:01:42,940 --> 02:01:43,970
the wrong data.

4504
02:01:43,971 --> 02:01:46,620
So first let's talk over each other.

4505
02:01:46,770 --> 02:01:47,300
Okay,

4506
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:47,990
so he,

4507
02:01:47,990 --> 02:01:52,490
he said that the murder rate
did not demonstrate that
marijuana legalization and

4508
02:01:52,570 --> 02:01:56,090
increases violence and then it may have
actually demonstrated that legalization

4509
02:01:56,091 --> 02:01:59,660
is slightly decreased fonts and he thinks
that that the reason that there was an

4510
02:01:59,661 --> 02:02:01,220
increase in the murder rate,

4511
02:02:01,221 --> 02:02:04,820
particularly in Washington is
because there was a large income gap.

4512
02:02:05,030 --> 02:02:09,440
They say that Washington has the 10th
largest income gap in the United States.

4513
02:02:09,620 --> 02:02:10,111
That's why.

4514
02:02:10,111 --> 02:02:12,700
How did that change how that
corresponds to the murderer?

4515
02:02:12,770 --> 02:02:13,603
Good question though.

4516
02:02:13,950 --> 02:02:14,790
I'm so,

4517
02:02:14,840 --> 02:02:15,390
I haven't,

4518
02:02:15,390 --> 02:02:15,620
you know,

4519
02:02:15,620 --> 02:02:18,620
I didn't get to speak with
Benjamin to about this,

4520
02:02:18,630 --> 02:02:20,030
but sounds like confirmation bias.

4521
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:21,170
Well he,

4522
02:02:21,170 --> 02:02:26,170
I mean that is one thing that has been
shown to increase mental illness like

4523
02:02:26,571 --> 02:02:30,350
we've talked about and can definitely
increase violence is when you have an

4524
02:02:30,351 --> 02:02:31,170
income gap.

4525
02:02:31,170 --> 02:02:35,960
And how's the income gap shifted that
directly correlates to the legalization of

4526
02:02:35,961 --> 02:02:37,820
marijuana because during the scene,

4527
02:02:37,850 --> 02:02:39,260
because during the same period,

4528
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:40,251
the income gap,

4529
02:02:40,251 --> 02:02:42,740
particularly in Washington increased.

4530
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:44,180
So he feels that,

4531
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:44,580
you know,

4532
02:02:44,580 --> 02:02:45,680
it's corresponding number,

4533
02:02:45,740 --> 02:02:46,250
right.

4534
02:02:46,250 --> 02:02:48,770
So he feels that it's likely more,

4535
02:02:48,771 --> 02:02:49,500
more to that.

4536
02:02:49,500 --> 02:02:50,150
And I mean he,

4537
02:02:50,150 --> 02:02:50,570
I mean,

4538
02:02:50,570 --> 02:02:51,440
I understand,

4539
02:02:51,441 --> 02:02:53,270
but I mean you have to respect this guy,

4540
02:02:53,271 --> 02:02:53,480
man.

4541
02:02:53,480 --> 02:02:56,030
I don't respect him because I
know what he did with his data.

4542
02:02:56,280 --> 02:02:57,113
And tell me

4543
02:02:58,630 --> 02:02:58,940
this,

4544
02:02:58,940 --> 02:02:59,960
this is maddening to me.

4545
02:03:01,700 --> 02:03:06,700
Violent crime in those four
states increased more rapidly
than in the u s period

4546
02:03:07,790 --> 02:03:11,120
between 2013 and 2017
Jamie just posted this,

4547
02:03:11,540 --> 02:03:12,380
conjecture aside,

4548
02:03:12,381 --> 02:03:13,490
no credible data exists.

4549
02:03:13,491 --> 02:03:16,520
It supports a significant association
between the increase in violent crime and

4550
02:03:16,521 --> 02:03:17,690
marijuana legalization.

4551
02:03:17,900 --> 02:03:18,411
Furthermore,

4552
02:03:18,411 --> 02:03:22,790
studies suggest that so far violent
crime decreases in states with legalized

4553
02:03:22,791 --> 02:03:26,510
medical marijuana until new
research credibly suggest otherwise.

4554
02:03:26,510 --> 02:03:31,070
The claim that a demonstratable link
between the two exists will remain

4555
02:03:31,071 --> 02:03:32,440
classified as false.

4556
02:03:32,441 --> 02:03:34,190
So that's just not true.

4557
02:03:34,430 --> 02:03:34,731
Okay?

4558
02:03:34,731 --> 02:03:35,810
I know it's Snopes.

4559
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:36,171
Okay.

4560
02:03:36,171 --> 02:03:37,610
And I know we trust Snopes.

4561
02:03:37,700 --> 02:03:38,600
I don't trust them that

4562
02:03:40,370 --> 02:03:41,181
I was gonna say that too.

4563
02:03:41,181 --> 02:03:41,630
But they're,

4564
02:03:41,630 --> 02:03:42,480
they give all of their,

4565
02:03:42,570 --> 02:03:43,403
their source.

4566
02:03:43,990 --> 02:03:44,823
So again,

4567
02:03:45,990 --> 02:03:46,341
do you,

4568
02:03:46,341 --> 02:03:47,174
are you,

4569
02:03:47,450 --> 02:03:48,500
where are these sources?

4570
02:03:48,860 --> 02:03:51,040
I've read this stuff and
what's wrong with them here?

4571
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:52,850
Let me just go back to what I'm saying.

4572
02:03:53,050 --> 02:03:53,883
Please do it.

4573
02:03:53,900 --> 02:03:56,060
2013 Oregon,

4574
02:03:56,390 --> 02:03:57,223
Washington,

4575
02:03:57,230 --> 02:03:58,063
Colorado,

4576
02:03:58,070 --> 02:03:58,903
Alaska.

4577
02:03:58,940 --> 02:04:01,790
There are 450 murders
in those four states.

4578
02:04:01,970 --> 02:04:04,070
There are 30,000 agg assault period.

4579
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:05,233
Okay.

4580
02:04:05,660 --> 02:04:07,250
2017 Oregon,

4581
02:04:07,490 --> 02:04:08,323
Washington,

4582
02:04:08,390 --> 02:04:09,170
Colorado,

4583
02:04:09,170 --> 02:04:09,740
Alaska.

4584
02:04:09,740 --> 02:04:11,870
There are 620 murders
in those four states.

4585
02:04:11,900 --> 02:04:13,490
That's an almost 40% increase.

4586
02:04:13,580 --> 02:04:15,140
There are 38,000 agg assaults.

4587
02:04:15,141 --> 02:04:16,610
That's a 25% increase.

4588
02:04:16,850 --> 02:04:18,320
If you adjust for population,

4589
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:20,990
you still get big increases in Denver,

4590
02:04:21,110 --> 02:04:23,270
2018 almost 70 murders.

4591
02:04:23,300 --> 02:04:25,370
There were about 35 and 2013.

4592
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:30,230
Seattle 27 2018 there were 34 35 murders.

4593
02:04:30,231 --> 02:04:30,471
There were,

4594
02:04:30,471 --> 02:04:34,460
I think 19 in 2013 these
increases are real.

4595
02:04:34,610 --> 02:04:35,443
Okay,

4596
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:35,840
now,

4597
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:36,110
now,

4598
02:04:36,110 --> 02:04:36,790
now,

4599
02:04:36,790 --> 02:04:37,110
okay.

4600
02:04:37,110 --> 02:04:38,250
Can we say

4601
02:04:38,700 --> 02:04:41,610
that marijuana legalization
caused those increases?

4602
02:04:41,730 --> 02:04:42,960
We cannot yet.

4603
02:04:43,230 --> 02:04:44,730
There are other possibilities.

4604
02:04:44,930 --> 02:04:45,441
And you're,

4605
02:04:45,441 --> 02:04:46,274
what are those?

4606
02:04:46,290 --> 02:04:47,123
Um,

4607
02:04:47,370 --> 02:04:47,671
well,

4608
02:04:47,671 --> 02:04:48,750
one positive first of all,

4609
02:04:48,751 --> 02:04:50,070
population did increase.

4610
02:04:50,071 --> 02:04:51,690
It's also possible that these states,

4611
02:04:51,691 --> 02:04:53,670
quote unquote imported violent crime.

4612
02:04:53,671 --> 02:04:57,300
And other ones that you've got a
population of transients coming in in part

4613
02:04:57,330 --> 02:05:00,810
because marijuana was legal and those
people are likely to commit violent crime

4614
02:05:00,870 --> 02:05:03,540
and on top of that organized
crime people that are selling.

4615
02:05:03,720 --> 02:05:04,471
Absolutely.

4616
02:05:04,471 --> 02:05:08,130
There may have been some people
who are exporting to to Nebraska,

4617
02:05:08,131 --> 02:05:08,911
to Minnesota,

4618
02:05:08,911 --> 02:05:09,691
to other states.

4619
02:05:09,691 --> 02:05:11,070
There's crime associated with that,

4620
02:05:11,550 --> 02:05:14,400
but what I am saying
is that unequivocally,

4621
02:05:14,820 --> 02:05:15,571
unequivocally,

4622
02:05:15,571 --> 02:05:19,680
the people who said legalization is going
to decrease violent crime and people

4623
02:05:19,681 --> 02:05:20,610
did say that.

4624
02:05:20,700 --> 02:05:23,340
And Cory booker in 2010 17 said it,

4625
02:05:23,580 --> 02:05:27,210
he said that it actually had decreased
violent crime in states that legalized

4626
02:05:27,211 --> 02:05:28,680
and he didn't say it randomly.

4627
02:05:28,830 --> 02:05:32,730
He said it when he was introducing
legislation to legalize marijuana on the

4628
02:05:32,731 --> 02:05:33,564
federal level.

4629
02:05:33,780 --> 02:05:36,390
Those people are wrong and
they need to stop saying it.

4630
02:05:36,630 --> 02:05:37,231
I know.

4631
02:05:37,231 --> 02:05:39,630
And by the way that
Oregon economists used,

4632
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:42,990
he used the wrong data set for his charts.

4633
02:05:43,020 --> 02:05:43,440
Okay.

4634
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:44,010
He used,

4635
02:05:44,010 --> 02:05:45,420
I used the real numbers.

4636
02:05:45,421 --> 02:05:45,721
Okay.

4637
02:05:45,721 --> 02:05:48,120
The FBI homicide numbers.

4638
02:05:48,180 --> 02:05:50,760
He used numbers that include
justifiable homicides,

4639
02:05:50,970 --> 02:05:51,803
police,

4640
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:57,500
the FBI report that the murder rate went
up 1% from 2015 to 2016 as compared to

4641
02:05:57,541 --> 02:05:58,470
the nationwide,

4642
02:05:58,471 --> 02:05:58,741
which one?

4643
02:05:58,741 --> 02:06:03,741
It was 3.9% and then it dropped by
11.6% between 2016 and 20 seconds.

4644
02:06:05,370 --> 02:06:07,500
I do not know what you're talking about.

4645
02:06:07,810 --> 02:06:09,700
Those are FBI numbers of breeding,

4646
02:06:09,730 --> 02:06:11,610
not know what you're talking about.

4647
02:06:11,790 --> 02:06:13,860
The numbers are clear.

4648
02:06:14,160 --> 02:06:14,940
Okay.

4649
02:06:14,940 --> 02:06:16,710
I use them reading them right now.

4650
02:06:16,830 --> 02:06:20,100
2016 release of FBI uniform
crime reports from Oregon.

4651
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:21,420
Okay.

4652
02:06:21,420 --> 02:06:21,780
Yes,

4653
02:06:21,780 --> 02:06:22,500
Oregon.

4654
02:06:22,500 --> 02:06:24,690
You're not reading the reports
from the United States.

4655
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:28,200
You're picking one state for women
showing something will state that has

4656
02:06:28,201 --> 02:06:32,070
legalized medical cannabis over the
entire country from that time period too.

4657
02:06:32,071 --> 02:06:35,130
So to pick those four states
where marijuana was legalized,

4658
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:36,293
sort of cherry picking,

4659
02:06:36,950 --> 02:06:39,870
picking every state where there were
legalized and comparing it to the whole

4660
02:06:39,871 --> 02:06:40,231
country,

4661
02:06:40,231 --> 02:06:41,064
the whole country,

4662
02:06:41,550 --> 02:06:42,280
the whole country.

4663
02:06:42,280 --> 02:06:43,500
You'll see a similar,

4664
02:06:43,560 --> 02:06:44,680
is it a similar increase?

4665
02:06:45,510 --> 02:06:46,780
That's what I'm trying to

4666
02:06:48,630 --> 02:06:50,000
pull back so we can see the whole stuff.

4667
02:06:50,530 --> 02:06:50,860
So,

4668
02:06:50,860 --> 02:06:51,270
first of all,

4669
02:06:51,270 --> 02:06:54,450
that's a violent crime
coordinators and ag out crime,

4670
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:57,870
violent crime and that ag assaults,

4671
02:06:57,871 --> 02:06:58,560
aren't they?

4672
02:06:58,560 --> 02:06:58,861
No.

4673
02:06:58,861 --> 02:06:59,670
So so,

4674
02:06:59,670 --> 02:07:02,760
so the four categories of
violent crime or murder,

4675
02:07:02,761 --> 02:07:03,331
agg assault,

4676
02:07:03,331 --> 02:07:04,740
robbery and rape.

4677
02:07:05,160 --> 02:07:07,050
Rape has sort of gone
sideways the last few years.

4678
02:07:07,051 --> 02:07:08,370
Robberies actually have gone down.

4679
02:07:08,610 --> 02:07:12,810
It's murders and ag assaults that
are interpersonal violent crime.

4680
02:07:13,140 --> 02:07:13,650
Okay.

4681
02:07:13,650 --> 02:07:15,450
Just to go back to this Oregon economist,

4682
02:07:15,451 --> 02:07:16,770
because this maddens me,

4683
02:07:17,010 --> 02:07:21,790
he used a Dataset that is not the
standard data set to report murder rate.

4684
02:07:21,790 --> 02:07:22,623
What is the difference?

4685
02:07:22,830 --> 02:07:25,710
He used the data set that
includes justifiable homicides,

4686
02:07:25,711 --> 02:07:27,240
meaning I'm in my house,

4687
02:07:27,241 --> 02:07:28,074
you come in,

4688
02:07:28,110 --> 02:07:29,070
I shoot you and kill you.

4689
02:07:29,071 --> 02:07:32,430
The police don't charge me with
anything and police homicides,

4690
02:07:32,660 --> 02:07:35,130
but you use your book published.

4691
02:07:35,140 --> 02:07:36,220
Let's not let it interrupt.

4692
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:37,083
Let me finish.

4693
02:07:37,540 --> 02:07:42,100
Those two categories of crime are not
likely to be impacted by cannabis use.

4694
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:44,620
Cops are not smoking when
they're on patrol eyes.

4695
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:45,370
Hope.

4696
02:07:45,370 --> 02:07:47,050
And if you are using,

4697
02:07:47,080 --> 02:07:50,350
you're very unlikely to have your
murder viewed as justifiable homicide.

4698
02:07:50,530 --> 02:07:55,530
The fair comparison is the base murder
rate in the u s and that's the number

4699
02:07:56,471 --> 02:07:57,700
that I used.

4700
02:07:57,880 --> 02:07:59,020
And I am telling you,

4701
02:07:59,290 --> 02:08:00,910
I mean I know these numbers,

4702
02:08:01,150 --> 02:08:01,960
I sleep,

4703
02:08:01,960 --> 02:08:03,130
I wake up with these numbers,

4704
02:08:03,460 --> 02:08:04,293
cannabis,

4705
02:08:04,570 --> 02:08:08,170
the for cannabis legal
states on a per capita basis,

4706
02:08:08,350 --> 02:08:13,350
crime murders rose 31% on a per capita
basis in those four states over the 2013,

4707
02:08:15,281 --> 02:08:16,330
2017 period.

4708
02:08:17,050 --> 02:08:17,410
Maybe,

4709
02:08:17,410 --> 02:08:18,430
I'm sorry I said 31.

4710
02:08:18,431 --> 02:08:19,480
Maybe it's 29%.

4711
02:08:19,481 --> 02:08:21,790
So maybe I say I woke up anyway.

4712
02:08:21,791 --> 02:08:22,330
The the,

4713
02:08:22,330 --> 02:08:26,950
for the US it's 18% 29% versus 18%.

4714
02:08:27,190 --> 02:08:28,360
That's the gap.

4715
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:33,160
And I am not saying that I know that
cannabis legalization cause that gap,

4716
02:08:33,340 --> 02:08:38,170
what I'm saying is people need to stop
claiming that cannabis legalization

4717
02:08:38,171 --> 02:08:39,340
reduces violent crime.

4718
02:08:39,341 --> 02:08:40,090
It in,

4719
02:08:40,090 --> 02:08:41,950
it has increased in those tasks.

4720
02:08:41,951 --> 02:08:43,360
You in those states was at universal,

4721
02:08:43,361 --> 02:08:43,931
the increase,

4722
02:08:43,931 --> 02:08:45,340
was it almost identical?

4723
02:08:45,380 --> 02:08:45,730
Yes.

4724
02:08:45,730 --> 02:08:47,110
Alaska was the most,

4725
02:08:47,170 --> 02:08:47,650
uh,

4726
02:08:47,650 --> 02:08:51,370
then I think murders went up
more in college in Washington.

4727
02:08:51,490 --> 02:08:52,180
Uh,

4728
02:08:52,180 --> 02:08:53,590
and what's also interesting,

4729
02:08:53,591 --> 02:08:53,800
Joe,

4730
02:08:53,800 --> 02:08:54,071
if you're,

4731
02:08:54,071 --> 02:08:56,230
if you really want to go into the numbers,

4732
02:08:56,231 --> 02:08:58,780
is the gap actually widens year by year.

4733
02:08:59,020 --> 02:09:02,590
So that's sort of what you would expect
if this is the result of a psychometric

4734
02:09:02,591 --> 02:09:02,981
effect.

4735
02:09:02,981 --> 02:09:03,341
In other words,

4736
02:09:03,341 --> 02:09:07,390
a psychosis causing effect
because cannabis doesn't
cause psychosis right away.

4737
02:09:07,390 --> 02:09:08,390
People break down.

4738
02:09:08,680 --> 02:09:13,680
But if it's causing heavy use and some
of those people are sliding into paranoia

4739
02:09:14,321 --> 02:09:15,160
and psychosis,

4740
02:09:15,370 --> 02:09:18,070
you'd sort of expect the
gap to increase over time.

4741
02:09:18,071 --> 02:09:19,120
And that's what's happened.

4742
02:09:20,290 --> 02:09:20,741
Okay.

4743
02:09:20,741 --> 02:09:21,100
So,

4744
02:09:21,100 --> 02:09:21,340
you know,

4745
02:09:21,340 --> 02:09:24,430
I'm gonna go back again
to the Netherlands.

4746
02:09:24,460 --> 02:09:24,761
Okay.

4747
02:09:24,761 --> 02:09:25,660
Because they've had,

4748
02:09:25,930 --> 02:09:26,171
you know,

4749
02:09:26,171 --> 02:09:30,820
cannabis legalized forever and they have
one fifth of the homicide rate that the

4750
02:09:30,821 --> 02:09:31,840
United States does.

4751
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:34,630
And they also have a lower cannabis use.

4752
02:09:34,690 --> 02:09:35,523
That's true.

4753
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:36,633
They also very,

4754
02:09:37,450 --> 02:09:38,140
but still,

4755
02:09:38,140 --> 02:09:38,740
you know,

4756
02:09:38,740 --> 02:09:40,710
one warrior kick boxers,

4757
02:09:42,610 --> 02:09:43,443
but,

4758
02:09:43,670 --> 02:09:44,170
uh,

4759
02:09:44,170 --> 02:09:44,620
one,

4760
02:09:44,620 --> 02:09:45,311
one fifth.

4761
02:09:45,311 --> 02:09:45,551
I mean,

4762
02:09:45,551 --> 02:09:46,091
it's still,

4763
02:09:46,091 --> 02:09:46,251
it's,

4764
02:09:46,251 --> 02:09:47,650
it's pretty drastic overall.

4765
02:09:47,651 --> 02:09:48,371
And again,

4766
02:09:48,371 --> 02:09:48,581
you know,

4767
02:09:48,581 --> 02:09:48,970
Alex,

4768
02:09:48,970 --> 02:09:49,510
you know,

4769
02:09:49,510 --> 02:09:49,721
you know,

4770
02:09:49,721 --> 02:09:52,300
I appreciate some of the reason we're
talking about the correlation between

4771
02:09:52,301 --> 02:09:52,901
cannabis use.

4772
02:09:52,901 --> 02:09:53,491
One of the things that,

4773
02:09:53,491 --> 02:09:53,551
yeah,

4774
02:09:53,551 --> 02:09:53,700
we

4775
02:09:53,700 --> 02:09:58,290
have to accept it in America is that when
you're in a place like the Netherlands

4776
02:09:58,410 --> 02:10:01,830
has a long and accepted history of use,

4777
02:10:02,130 --> 02:10:03,360
people are accustomed to it.

4778
02:10:03,390 --> 02:10:04,920
So I think things kind of even out.

4779
02:10:04,921 --> 02:10:07,200
I think one of the things that we're
dealing with with the United States is

4780
02:10:07,201 --> 02:10:08,670
people that have just,

4781
02:10:08,700 --> 02:10:09,120
they don't,

4782
02:10:09,120 --> 02:10:12,930
they don't have a long
history of experience and it
becomes legal and then they

4783
02:10:12,931 --> 02:10:13,411
use it.

4784
02:10:13,411 --> 02:10:17,310
And maybe some of them like we're talking
about don't have a tolerance for it,

4785
02:10:17,490 --> 02:10:18,510
have too much.

4786
02:10:18,810 --> 02:10:22,940
And I was talking about with my
friend who's like this really cotton,

4787
02:10:22,980 --> 02:10:24,330
the one who,

4788
02:10:24,331 --> 02:10:24,750
uh,

4789
02:10:24,750 --> 02:10:27,960
had an edible and became suicidal
and was fucked up for weeks.

4790
02:10:28,210 --> 02:10:29,790
You guys very confident,

4791
02:10:29,791 --> 02:10:30,750
very articulate,

4792
02:10:30,751 --> 02:10:31,770
very intelligent.

4793
02:10:32,040 --> 02:10:32,873
He's not a,

4794
02:10:32,910 --> 02:10:33,920
not a Weirdo,

4795
02:10:33,950 --> 02:10:34,220
not

4796
02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:35,510
a non transient extreme,

4797
02:10:35,511 --> 02:10:36,890
extremely successful.

4798
02:10:37,790 --> 02:10:38,121
You know,

4799
02:10:38,121 --> 02:10:39,440
I think there are,

4800
02:10:39,500 --> 02:10:42,650
there are variables that we need to take
into consideration and there's certain

4801
02:10:42,651 --> 02:10:46,630
human beings that exhibit a pattern of
behavior that's directly correlated to

4802
02:10:46,650 --> 02:10:49,580
cannabis use that I don't experience.

4803
02:10:49,670 --> 02:10:50,341
So if I,

4804
02:10:50,341 --> 02:10:53,780
I could say from my own personal
biases that that's bullshit.

4805
02:10:53,781 --> 02:10:54,501
That's nothing.

4806
02:10:54,501 --> 02:10:55,221
It doesn't do anything.

4807
02:10:55,221 --> 02:10:56,240
I've been smoking for years,

4808
02:10:56,241 --> 02:10:56,960
doesn't do shit.

4809
02:10:56,960 --> 02:11:00,440
Well you probably don't have one of those
three genes that we were talking about

4810
02:11:02,550 --> 02:11:04,280
and you probably also to,

4811
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:05,120
um,

4812
02:11:05,120 --> 02:11:05,361
you know,

4813
02:11:05,361 --> 02:11:07,970
don't overuse or you have some type of,

4814
02:11:08,210 --> 02:11:08,710
you know,

4815
02:11:08,710 --> 02:11:09,050
um,

4816
02:11:09,050 --> 02:11:11,240
legitimacy as to why you are,

4817
02:11:11,250 --> 02:11:12,140
you are using it.

4818
02:11:12,141 --> 02:11:13,070
And you know what,

4819
02:11:13,130 --> 02:11:14,390
I want to keep going with this.

4820
02:11:14,391 --> 02:11:15,224
But you know,

4821
02:11:15,260 --> 02:11:16,041
at the end of the show,

4822
02:11:16,041 --> 02:11:21,041
I think that we should make some type
of like recommendations for people just

4823
02:11:21,471 --> 02:11:23,060
because I hate when,

4824
02:11:23,090 --> 02:11:23,301
you know,

4825
02:11:23,301 --> 02:11:27,980
you have this big three hour podcasts
and then at the end of it it's just like,

4826
02:11:28,100 --> 02:11:28,581
hey guys,

4827
02:11:28,581 --> 02:11:29,480
just be safe.

4828
02:11:31,090 --> 02:11:31,923
It's like,

4829
02:11:33,900 --> 02:11:34,380
it's like,

4830
02:11:34,380 --> 02:11:35,213
let's have

4831
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:38,713
fun.

4832
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:40,833
Let's have

4833
02:11:41,590 --> 02:11:42,310
type of like,

4834
02:11:42,310 --> 02:11:42,810
um,

4835
02:11:42,810 --> 02:11:43,550
recommendations.

4836
02:11:43,550 --> 02:11:44,980
Like I love the podcast with,

4837
02:11:45,010 --> 02:11:45,320
uh,

4838
02:11:45,320 --> 02:11:45,520
with,

4839
02:11:45,520 --> 02:11:47,140
with Chris Kresser and Joel.

4840
02:11:47,170 --> 02:11:47,710
Right?

4841
02:11:47,710 --> 02:11:48,041
But,

4842
02:11:48,041 --> 02:11:48,730
um,

4843
02:11:48,730 --> 02:11:49,241
at the,

4844
02:11:49,241 --> 02:11:50,680
at the end of it was just sort of like,

4845
02:11:50,681 --> 02:11:51,514
hey guys,

4846
02:11:51,640 --> 02:11:52,690
do anything there can die.

4847
02:11:53,410 --> 02:11:57,580
Most people realize that one person was
going on data and the other person was

4848
02:11:58,580 --> 02:11:59,413
for sure.

4849
02:11:59,880 --> 02:12:03,070
I find it so fascinating that now
when you think back through your,

4850
02:12:03,430 --> 02:12:04,031
through your life,

4851
02:12:04,031 --> 02:12:04,210
you've,

4852
02:12:04,210 --> 02:12:06,220
you've thought of
somebody who was affected,

4853
02:12:06,221 --> 02:12:07,360
that there were several people.

4854
02:12:07,480 --> 02:12:09,670
I'll bet I'll bet as you think about it,

4855
02:12:09,671 --> 02:12:11,980
you'll think of more people maybe.

4856
02:12:12,100 --> 02:12:13,300
But those are the big ones.

4857
02:12:13,301 --> 02:12:14,170
And like I said,

4858
02:12:14,171 --> 02:12:17,290
my friend who is a martial arts instructor
was a pretty significant issue with a

4859
02:12:17,291 --> 02:12:18,041
lot of our friends.

4860
02:12:18,041 --> 02:12:20,140
We were trying to figure out what
was wrong with him beforehand.

4861
02:12:20,380 --> 02:12:23,230
He was sending me these videos
that didn't make any sense.

4862
02:12:23,500 --> 02:12:24,031
And uh,

4863
02:12:24,031 --> 02:12:24,521
I was like,

4864
02:12:24,521 --> 02:12:25,930
what in the fuck is this?

4865
02:12:25,931 --> 02:12:26,590
Like I'll,

4866
02:12:26,590 --> 02:12:29,920
I'll explain to you more often
Arabic so I don't have to uh,

4867
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:30,873
out this guy.

4868
02:12:31,030 --> 02:12:32,380
But what will the,

4869
02:12:32,390 --> 02:12:35,680
all a lot of people that were close to
him were really seriously concerned.

4870
02:12:35,780 --> 02:12:38,770
Now is it something that
would have happened anyway?

4871
02:12:38,920 --> 02:12:39,753
I don't know.

4872
02:12:40,490 --> 02:12:41,770
He's in his twenties.

4873
02:12:42,620 --> 02:12:43,390
How old is that?

4874
02:12:43,390 --> 02:12:44,590
Late twenties 20.

4875
02:12:44,591 --> 02:12:45,070
You know,

4876
02:12:45,070 --> 02:12:46,240
that's right around the age.

4877
02:12:46,241 --> 02:12:47,600
So it is,

4878
02:12:47,860 --> 02:12:48,641
it's a little,

4879
02:12:48,641 --> 02:12:50,140
a little bit late Ish.

4880
02:12:50,170 --> 02:12:50,680
Like,

4881
02:12:50,680 --> 02:12:51,401
cause like I said,

4882
02:12:51,401 --> 02:12:52,211
a lot of the studies,

4883
02:12:52,211 --> 02:12:54,640
even when you look at
the ones on adolescents,

4884
02:12:54,641 --> 02:12:56,920
like for sure it's below,

4885
02:12:56,921 --> 02:12:57,521
like they've,

4886
02:12:57,521 --> 02:13:02,521
they have done studies like blow 18 is
worse than say below 25 blow 15 is worse

4887
02:13:03,041 --> 02:13:03,761
than say 18.

4888
02:13:03,761 --> 02:13:07,900
Like the younger you go the worst
and he seems to be fine now.

4889
02:13:07,930 --> 02:13:08,260
That's good.

4890
02:13:08,260 --> 02:13:08,700
That's good.

4891
02:13:08,700 --> 02:13:08,870
Yeah.

4892
02:13:08,870 --> 02:13:09,491
Using now,

4893
02:13:09,491 --> 02:13:10,324
I don't know.

4894
02:13:10,690 --> 02:13:11,171
And it's,

4895
02:13:11,171 --> 02:13:11,800
uh,

4896
02:13:11,800 --> 02:13:12,011
you know,

4897
02:13:12,011 --> 02:13:13,360
I'm not an expert on the subject,

4898
02:13:13,361 --> 02:13:13,550
but it's,

4899
02:13:13,550 --> 02:13:14,680
it's because of this,

4900
02:13:14,870 --> 02:13:15,550
um,

4901
02:13:15,550 --> 02:13:17,260
if somebody called pruning
that we go through,

4902
02:13:17,261 --> 02:13:21,730
so everyone goes through this and
basically if your adolescents,

4903
02:13:21,731 --> 02:13:22,990
you're going to drop off some,

4904
02:13:22,991 --> 02:13:26,330
some weak neuroconnections to kind
of pick up some stronger ones.

4905
02:13:26,331 --> 02:13:26,371
So,

4906
02:13:26,371 --> 02:13:26,600
you know,

4907
02:13:26,600 --> 02:13:28,090
it's the best way to kind of explain it.

4908
02:13:28,520 --> 02:13:29,353
Um,

4909
02:13:29,620 --> 02:13:30,550
when you use cannabis,

4910
02:13:30,551 --> 02:13:32,250
you can potentially accelerate

4911
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:33,390
that process.

4912
02:13:33,630 --> 02:13:36,120
And then because you
accelerate that process,

4913
02:13:36,270 --> 02:13:39,060
you don't get those
good neuro connections.

4914
02:13:39,061 --> 02:13:39,480
And then,

4915
02:13:39,480 --> 02:13:39,691
you know,

4916
02:13:39,691 --> 02:13:40,770
people unfortunately,

4917
02:13:40,771 --> 02:13:41,041
you know,

4918
02:13:41,041 --> 02:13:41,950
develop things like,

4919
02:13:41,951 --> 02:13:43,020
like psychosis and,

4920
02:13:43,300 --> 02:13:43,980
um,

4921
02:13:43,980 --> 02:13:44,170
and,

4922
02:13:44,170 --> 02:13:45,090
and schizophrenia.

4923
02:13:45,091 --> 02:13:45,510
So,

4924
02:13:45,510 --> 02:13:45,690
you know,

4925
02:13:45,690 --> 02:13:47,000
that's kind of where they were,

4926
02:13:47,001 --> 02:13:47,880
where the issue lies.

4927
02:13:47,881 --> 02:13:48,300
So,

4928
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:48,481
you know,

4929
02:13:48,481 --> 02:13:50,730
one thing that I am very happy,

4930
02:13:50,760 --> 02:13:51,210
uh,

4931
02:13:51,210 --> 02:13:53,430
that we're talking about
and I know Alex will be too,

4932
02:13:53,431 --> 02:13:53,910
is that,

4933
02:13:53,910 --> 02:13:54,090
you know,

4934
02:13:54,090 --> 02:13:57,360
we want to discuss the
benefits and in this podcast,

4935
02:13:57,361 --> 02:13:59,400
make sure that people understand that,

4936
02:13:59,520 --> 02:13:59,940
you know,

4937
02:13:59,940 --> 02:14:01,830
I believe that marijuana is Madison.

4938
02:14:01,831 --> 02:14:03,060
It's an excellent medicine.

4939
02:14:03,330 --> 02:14:03,690
Um,

4940
02:14:03,690 --> 02:14:08,690
but the other thing though too is we do
want to mitigate the risks because there

4941
02:14:08,821 --> 02:14:10,350
are real risks out there.

4942
02:14:10,351 --> 02:14:10,800
So,

4943
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:11,071
you know,

4944
02:14:11,071 --> 02:14:12,300
I do appreciate,

4945
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:12,930
you know,

4946
02:14:12,930 --> 02:14:13,230
um,

4947
02:14:13,230 --> 02:14:16,950
US talking about adolescence and making
sure that they do stay away from Canton.

4948
02:14:17,120 --> 02:14:18,490
This especially,

4949
02:14:18,491 --> 02:14:19,960
that's why I read these,

4950
02:14:19,961 --> 02:14:20,620
you know,

4951
02:14:20,620 --> 02:14:22,920
these cases is a case file sometimes.

4952
02:14:22,921 --> 02:14:23,290
Then,

4953
02:14:23,290 --> 02:14:24,123
you know,

4954
02:14:24,300 --> 02:14:26,950
the kids started using when
he was 11 and you know,

4955
02:14:26,951 --> 02:14:28,660
it's like that kid never had a chance.

4956
02:14:28,690 --> 02:14:28,861
Right.

4957
02:14:28,861 --> 02:14:29,051
I mean,

4958
02:14:29,051 --> 02:14:29,930
and obviously the,

4959
02:14:29,940 --> 02:14:33,610
oftentimes these are kids coming from
disadvantaged backgrounds anyway,

4960
02:14:33,611 --> 02:14:34,630
but you know,

4961
02:14:34,631 --> 02:14:36,250
they're using by 11 and it's 16.

4962
02:14:36,251 --> 02:14:36,720
They put,

4963
02:14:36,720 --> 02:14:37,001
you know,

4964
02:14:37,001 --> 02:14:38,650
put a gun to somebody's
head and pull the trigger.

4965
02:14:38,651 --> 02:14:39,484
I mean

4966
02:14:40,870 --> 02:14:43,450
the pre adolescent and early teen news,

4967
02:14:43,600 --> 02:14:45,190
we got to do everything we can to stop.

4968
02:14:45,400 --> 02:14:46,061
The problem is,

4969
02:14:46,061 --> 02:14:46,241
yeah,

4970
02:14:46,241 --> 02:14:46,781
like if you,

4971
02:14:46,781 --> 02:14:48,790
if you smoke pot in junior high,

4972
02:14:48,820 --> 02:14:49,511
like say seven,

4973
02:14:49,511 --> 02:14:49,661
eight,

4974
02:14:49,661 --> 02:14:49,991
nine,

4975
02:14:49,991 --> 02:14:51,970
like you're probably going
to smoke pot in high school.

4976
02:14:52,170 --> 02:14:53,003
Like that's the,

4977
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:53,381
I mean,

4978
02:14:53,381 --> 02:14:56,670
that's what I saw when we went out
when I was growing up and you know,

4979
02:14:56,830 --> 02:14:59,710
even when I was a home for Christmas for,

4980
02:14:59,711 --> 02:15:00,580
for a few days,

4981
02:15:00,581 --> 02:15:01,210
like yeah,

4982
02:15:01,210 --> 02:15:03,010
a couple of my friends even talked about,

4983
02:15:03,011 --> 02:15:03,560
you know,

4984
02:15:03,560 --> 02:15:03,880
um,

4985
02:15:03,880 --> 02:15:05,050
some people that we knew,

4986
02:15:05,080 --> 02:15:05,330
you know,

4987
02:15:05,330 --> 02:15:09,550
smoked pot in high school and
like now like they're there,

4988
02:15:09,640 --> 02:15:11,740
they're crazy or they're not
really doing too too much,

4989
02:15:11,741 --> 02:15:12,041
you know,

4990
02:15:12,041 --> 02:15:14,200
so you do have to be careful with that.

4991
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:17,140
I think we're dealing
with a lot of ignorance.

4992
02:15:17,141 --> 02:15:20,860
We're dealing with a lot of ignorance
and occur when it comes to biological

4993
02:15:20,861 --> 02:15:21,694
variability,

4994
02:15:21,700 --> 02:15:21,940
right?

4995
02:15:21,940 --> 02:15:22,071
We,

4996
02:15:22,071 --> 02:15:22,450
we,

4997
02:15:22,450 --> 02:15:25,840
we don't really understand how a lot of
these different things affect people,

4998
02:15:26,110 --> 02:15:28,770
including like just diet and what,

4999
02:15:28,771 --> 02:15:29,041
what,

5000
02:15:29,041 --> 02:15:30,340
what causes depression.

5001
02:15:30,341 --> 02:15:30,580
Like,

5002
02:15:30,580 --> 02:15:31,060
how much,

5003
02:15:31,060 --> 02:15:34,900
how much of what we constitute
or what we decide is depression.

5004
02:15:34,901 --> 02:15:37,780
Is Inflammation a poor gut health?

5005
02:15:37,781 --> 02:15:38,800
There's a lot of variables.

5006
02:15:38,830 --> 02:15:39,670
There's a lot of them.

5007
02:15:39,880 --> 02:15:42,100
Marijuana is absolutely
one of those variables.

5008
02:15:42,460 --> 02:15:43,061
And uh,

5009
02:15:43,061 --> 02:15:43,750
again,

5010
02:15:43,750 --> 02:15:44,650
I don't have an issue with it.

5011
02:15:44,680 --> 02:15:45,191
I liked it.

5012
02:15:45,191 --> 02:15:46,024
I love this stuff,

5013
02:15:46,390 --> 02:15:46,960
but it does,

5014
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:47,920
it doesn't fuck with me,

5015
02:15:48,460 --> 02:15:53,110
but I'm also honest and so I see these
people where it's pretty obvious to me

5016
02:15:53,111 --> 02:15:56,620
that something's going on and that
marijuana is not a good idea for them.

5017
02:15:56,621 --> 02:15:57,880
And I just think,

5018
02:15:58,440 --> 02:15:58,750
you know,

5019
02:15:58,750 --> 02:16:00,010
like I said in the past,

5020
02:16:00,020 --> 02:16:03,850
I myself have been guilty of using this,

5021
02:16:03,851 --> 02:16:04,241
uh,

5022
02:16:04,241 --> 02:16:08,920
this sort of a blanket description of it
as being a positive influence and that

5023
02:16:08,921 --> 02:16:10,060
it's a good thing for people.

5024
02:16:10,270 --> 02:16:11,620
I don't think it's a
good thing for everybody.

5025
02:16:12,040 --> 02:16:12,220
No,

5026
02:16:12,220 --> 02:16:14,920
it's definitely not a good thing for
everybody and it's definitely not a good

5027
02:16:14,921 --> 02:16:17,810
thing for the people who
have those genetics that I,

5028
02:16:17,890 --> 02:16:19,090
that I discussed earlier.

5029
02:16:19,091 --> 02:16:19,871
And you know,

5030
02:16:19,871 --> 02:16:20,651
also too,

5031
02:16:20,651 --> 02:16:21,160
like,

5032
02:16:21,160 --> 02:16:21,341
you know,

5033
02:16:21,341 --> 02:16:22,030
if you,

5034
02:16:22,030 --> 02:16:25,090
you need to have some type
of like self awareness,

5035
02:16:25,091 --> 02:16:28,120
like the people who you know
don't do well with cannabis,

5036
02:16:28,420 --> 02:16:29,030
you know,

5037
02:16:29,030 --> 02:16:29,863
you shouldn't have

5038
02:16:30,230 --> 02:16:34,140
to have your friends tell you that he
came in like you're not doing too well.

5039
02:16:34,660 --> 02:16:36,130
You should be able to figure out yourself.

5040
02:16:36,390 --> 02:16:37,570
But that's hard for people.

5041
02:16:37,571 --> 02:16:39,900
I mean that's one of the most difficult
things for people to do as itself.

5042
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:40,450
Upset,

5043
02:16:40,450 --> 02:16:42,880
self assess to be objective,

5044
02:16:42,910 --> 02:16:43,291
you know?

5045
02:16:43,291 --> 02:16:43,480
And,

5046
02:16:43,480 --> 02:16:44,290
and that it's,

5047
02:16:44,290 --> 02:16:47,410
I've obviously I've heard from a lot of
people who used heavily and seen other

5048
02:16:47,411 --> 02:16:50,590
people who've used heavily in the last
month and I think is very interesting why

5049
02:16:50,591 --> 02:16:53,810
people continue to use when
they're getting paranoid and,

5050
02:16:54,310 --> 02:16:55,210
and you know,

5051
02:16:55,240 --> 02:16:57,130
the most cogent argument,

5052
02:16:57,190 --> 02:16:57,551
and again,

5053
02:16:57,551 --> 02:16:58,170
I'm,

5054
02:16:58,170 --> 02:16:58,680
I'm not,

5055
02:16:58,680 --> 02:16:58,901
you know,

5056
02:16:58,901 --> 02:17:01,250
I've smoked a handful of
times in college and African,

5057
02:17:01,330 --> 02:17:04,960
I actually don't think I'd be comfortable
using high THC cannabis now knowing

5058
02:17:04,961 --> 02:17:05,794
what I know.

5059
02:17:05,830 --> 02:17:06,471
But anyway,

5060
02:17:06,471 --> 02:17:07,100
so the p the,

5061
02:17:07,100 --> 02:17:07,870
the people,

5062
02:17:07,870 --> 02:17:08,560
the most Godson,

5063
02:17:08,560 --> 02:17:09,393
Ryan here,

5064
02:17:12,240 --> 02:17:13,430
okay,

5065
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:14,830
I'm going to get hot box.

5066
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:19,100
I'll give you this shit
to put [inaudible] on the

5067
02:17:22,090 --> 02:17:22,720
with the most,

5068
02:17:22,720 --> 02:17:24,040
the most cogent argument.

5069
02:17:24,390 --> 02:17:25,570
W I thought it was so interesting.

5070
02:17:25,571 --> 02:17:25,961
This guy said,

5071
02:17:25,961 --> 02:17:26,711
well you know my friends,

5072
02:17:26,711 --> 02:17:27,544
I would talk to them and say,

5073
02:17:27,760 --> 02:17:30,010
I'm paranoid now but I'm
going to smoke through it.

5074
02:17:30,430 --> 02:17:35,170
I'm going to smoke so much that I'm
almost comfortable being paranoid and I

5075
02:17:35,171 --> 02:17:38,890
think that's a dangerous thing
to do to your mind cause you're,

5076
02:17:39,070 --> 02:17:43,480
you're sort of counting on being able to
step back from that and stop using you.

5077
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:43,930
That's a,

5078
02:17:43,930 --> 02:17:46,450
that's a silly way of looking at it.

5079
02:17:46,790 --> 02:17:50,770
I think that some of
what we call paranoia,

5080
02:17:50,830 --> 02:17:55,830
just normal paranoia is hypersensitivity
and hyper awareness and awareness to a

5081
02:17:56,501 --> 02:17:59,770
lot of things that you're putting off in
the back of your head because in order

5082
02:17:59,771 --> 02:18:02,470
to function as a normal person
and get through this life,

5083
02:18:02,471 --> 02:18:04,420
you can't really be aware of everything.

5084
02:18:04,480 --> 02:18:06,910
Otherwise you'd be paralyzed by fear.

5085
02:18:06,911 --> 02:18:07,990
We're in space.

5086
02:18:08,350 --> 02:18:08,651
Okay,

5087
02:18:08,651 --> 02:18:10,510
we are on a gigantic ball.

5088
02:18:10,511 --> 02:18:13,900
It's spinning a thousand miles
an hour hurling through infinity.

5089
02:18:13,930 --> 02:18:14,171
This,

5090
02:18:14,171 --> 02:18:15,430
this is reality,

5091
02:18:16,370 --> 02:18:18,700
this and take us out thin layer of gas.

5092
02:18:18,701 --> 02:18:22,340
It's protecting us from everything
that's flying around in our solar system.

5093
02:18:22,350 --> 02:18:22,710
By the way.

5094
02:18:22,710 --> 02:18:26,740
At best you get me five years and then
it's all right and even if you make it to

5095
02:18:26,741 --> 02:18:27,790
a hundred the last 15

5096
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:33,380
[inaudible] stem cells and stuff.

5097
02:18:34,640 --> 02:18:34,960
Yeah,

5098
02:18:34,960 --> 02:18:38,800
maybe a little live to be 300 what do
you do with the universe is infinite like

5099
02:18:38,850 --> 02:18:39,550
you're going to die.

5100
02:18:39,550 --> 02:18:42,010
Like the sun is going
to end like at the end.

5101
02:18:42,011 --> 02:18:45,270
I mean imagine if people do live to an
infinite number where we realized that

5102
02:18:45,340 --> 02:18:46,510
fucking son is dying.

5103
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:48,070
You're going to freak out about that.

5104
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:49,480
I mean it's all relative,

5105
02:18:49,481 --> 02:18:49,960
right?

5106
02:18:49,960 --> 02:18:50,601
So there,

5107
02:18:50,601 --> 02:18:55,510
there's only so much you really can think
about it and some of what paranoia is

5108
02:18:55,720 --> 02:18:58,810
is this hyper awareness of all these
variables that you really haven't,

5109
02:18:58,990 --> 02:18:59,823
haven't considered.

5110
02:19:00,160 --> 02:19:02,410
And then also we were
talking about before,

5111
02:19:02,411 --> 02:19:06,040
the things that can be beneficial to the
hyper awareness of how you communicated

5112
02:19:06,041 --> 02:19:06,530
with people.

5113
02:19:06,530 --> 02:19:08,050
Maybe you could have done
a better job with that.

5114
02:19:08,051 --> 02:19:08,620
Maybe you,

5115
02:19:08,620 --> 02:19:09,670
you came in hot,

5116
02:19:09,700 --> 02:19:11,800
maybe you were upset about something
else when you ran into them.

5117
02:19:11,801 --> 02:19:15,280
You already had a seven and they brought
you to a 10 it was totally unnecessary.

5118
02:19:15,281 --> 02:19:19,780
Within a normal situation you would have
only been at a too that those things

5119
02:19:19,781 --> 02:19:23,980
are real and sometimes marijuana helps
highlight all the errors in your way.

5120
02:19:23,981 --> 02:19:28,070
I think it can be a tool but my
description of it is like any other tool

5121
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:29,233
like a hammer,

5122
02:19:29,420 --> 02:19:32,180
you can build a house with a hammer or
you can just hit yourself in the Dick if

5123
02:19:32,181 --> 02:19:34,250
you're fucking crazy and this,

5124
02:19:34,251 --> 02:19:38,930
this is something that I think we should
consider when we're discussing almost

5125
02:19:38,931 --> 02:19:41,000
any psychedelic medicine and I think that,

5126
02:19:41,270 --> 02:19:44,420
I really do believe that marijuana is a
psychedelic and I don't even think it's

5127
02:19:44,421 --> 02:19:45,254
a mild one,

5128
02:19:45,350 --> 02:19:47,270
especially when it's an edible form.

5129
02:19:47,271 --> 02:19:48,380
I don't think it's mild at all.

5130
02:19:48,620 --> 02:19:48,891
Yeah,

5131
02:19:48,891 --> 02:19:49,271
I mean the,

5132
02:19:49,271 --> 02:19:54,271
there's some people that that come in
to my office for example and like just

5133
02:19:54,471 --> 02:19:55,191
when I meet them,

5134
02:19:55,191 --> 02:19:57,050
like after one or two minutes I was just,

5135
02:19:57,100 --> 02:19:58,280
I just got it the side of my head,

5136
02:19:58,310 --> 02:20:01,820
this person's not using THC like this.

5137
02:20:01,821 --> 02:20:04,600
This person is anxious
with gives you that.

5138
02:20:04,601 --> 02:20:04,641
It,

5139
02:20:04,641 --> 02:20:05,091
was that what it is?

5140
02:20:05,091 --> 02:20:05,750
Anxious.

5141
02:20:05,750 --> 02:20:06,320
Yeah.

5142
02:20:06,320 --> 02:20:07,910
It's just a feeling of,

5143
02:20:07,940 --> 02:20:08,773
um,

5144
02:20:08,930 --> 02:20:09,830
they're not really,

5145
02:20:09,831 --> 02:20:13,940
they're not someone who can just
sit and kind of like be by themself,

5146
02:20:13,970 --> 02:20:14,151
you know,

5147
02:20:14,151 --> 02:20:15,950
they just kind of give
me the impression that,

5148
02:20:16,220 --> 02:20:16,960
um,

5149
02:20:16,960 --> 02:20:17,180
you know,

5150
02:20:17,180 --> 02:20:17,350
they're,

5151
02:20:17,350 --> 02:20:18,900
they're not going to do well with,

5152
02:20:18,950 --> 02:20:23,690
with cannabis because if they
have any type of change in their,

5153
02:20:24,120 --> 02:20:24,530
um,

5154
02:20:24,530 --> 02:20:25,460
in their psyche,

5155
02:20:25,550 --> 02:20:26,750
they're going to see that as bad.

5156
02:20:26,870 --> 02:20:27,560
That's bad.

5157
02:20:27,560 --> 02:20:28,280
You know,

5158
02:20:28,280 --> 02:20:30,710
and like you got it when
you're using cannabis,

5159
02:20:30,730 --> 02:20:31,080
you,

5160
02:20:31,080 --> 02:20:32,780
you have to be sewn and who,

5161
02:20:32,960 --> 02:20:34,160
who knows that okay.

5162
02:20:34,340 --> 02:20:38,300
Are going to get a little bit of maybe
paranoia and out or at least my psyche is

5163
02:20:38,301 --> 02:20:39,200
going to change a little bit.

5164
02:20:39,230 --> 02:20:39,990
I am using,

5165
02:20:39,990 --> 02:20:40,160
you know,

5166
02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:43,580
psychoactive substance and
not be able to freak out.

5167
02:20:43,790 --> 02:20:44,031
Right.

5168
02:20:44,031 --> 02:20:44,930
But some people,

5169
02:20:45,230 --> 02:20:45,950
um,

5170
02:20:45,950 --> 02:20:46,400
you know,

5171
02:20:46,400 --> 02:20:49,100
I know that if they used
a little bit of Thc,

5172
02:20:49,130 --> 02:20:50,570
they probably would have a freak out.

5173
02:20:50,571 --> 02:20:51,860
They probably would have a bad experience.

5174
02:20:52,040 --> 02:20:53,300
Generally it's people who are,

5175
02:20:53,340 --> 02:20:53,600
you know,

5176
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:53,901
very,

5177
02:20:53,901 --> 02:20:55,010
very fearful.

5178
02:20:55,250 --> 02:20:55,400
Now,

5179
02:20:55,400 --> 02:20:59,720
the other side of that coin though is
that if you CBD and like we discussed

5180
02:20:59,721 --> 02:21:00,020
earlier,

5181
02:21:00,020 --> 02:21:01,490
that could decrease learned fear,

5182
02:21:01,520 --> 02:21:01,791
right?

5183
02:21:01,791 --> 02:21:02,210
So,

5184
02:21:02,210 --> 02:21:02,571
so that,

5185
02:21:02,571 --> 02:21:03,870
so that's something that's,

5186
02:21:03,871 --> 02:21:05,690
that's really helpful for those patients.

5187
02:21:05,691 --> 02:21:06,370
But you know,

5188
02:21:06,370 --> 02:21:07,340
I do agree that,

5189
02:21:07,370 --> 02:21:07,820
um,

5190
02:21:07,820 --> 02:21:07,971
you know,

5191
02:21:07,971 --> 02:21:12,971
we have to be careful about using
high THC and certain groups of people.

5192
02:21:13,431 --> 02:21:14,264
For sure.

5193
02:21:16,130 --> 02:21:16,310
You

5194
02:21:16,310 --> 02:21:16,570
know,

5195
02:21:16,570 --> 02:21:18,120
I think one of the,

5196
02:21:18,121 --> 02:21:20,550
and it's great to hear
a doctor heart say this,

5197
02:21:20,551 --> 02:21:21,060
I,

5198
02:21:21,060 --> 02:21:24,420
one of the real disappointments for
me with this book has been really the

5199
02:21:24,421 --> 02:21:26,790
biggest disappointing for
me has been that the DPA,

5200
02:21:26,791 --> 02:21:27,810
the drug policy alliance,

5201
02:21:27,811 --> 02:21:29,280
and that some of the other advocates,

5202
02:21:29,940 --> 02:21:31,110
they just want to yell at me.

5203
02:21:31,290 --> 02:21:34,320
And I want to say that I don't understand
correlation and causation and that I'm

5204
02:21:34,321 --> 02:21:35,340
cherry picking studies.

5205
02:21:35,730 --> 02:21:36,510
Let's,

5206
02:21:36,510 --> 02:21:40,410
let's acknowledge that a lot of
people use this drug and that's true,

5207
02:21:40,411 --> 02:21:42,060
whether it's legal or not.

5208
02:21:42,270 --> 02:21:43,260
And let's acknowledge that.

5209
02:21:43,261 --> 02:21:46,110
Probably in 2020 certainly if
there's a democrat elected,

5210
02:21:46,111 --> 02:21:47,960
most of the Democratic
candidates have said they,

5211
02:21:47,980 --> 02:21:49,290
they favor legalization.

5212
02:21:49,560 --> 02:21:53,430
There will legalize cannabis will
probably be the law in the United States.

5213
02:21:53,460 --> 02:21:54,150
Okay.

5214
02:21:54,150 --> 02:21:57,790
And let's talk about what we're going
to tell people who are using and,

5215
02:21:57,850 --> 02:21:58,380
and,

5216
02:21:58,380 --> 02:21:58,831
and you know,

5217
02:21:58,831 --> 02:22:00,270
I had this round table with,

5218
02:22:00,300 --> 02:22:00,960
uh,

5219
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:03,600
the executive director of the
DPA and some other people.

5220
02:22:03,601 --> 02:22:04,200
This was a,

5221
02:22:04,200 --> 02:22:05,340
this is about a month ago,

5222
02:22:05,370 --> 02:22:05,570
you know,

5223
02:22:05,570 --> 02:22:07,110
short of shortly after the book came out.

5224
02:22:07,350 --> 02:22:12,030
And I propose what I thought were really
common sense warnings and she basically

5225
02:22:12,031 --> 02:22:12,601
wouldn't agree.

5226
02:22:12,601 --> 02:22:15,810
I mean she agreed to like one of the five
of them or what were the warnings you

5227
02:22:15,811 --> 02:22:16,230
proposed?

5228
02:22:16,230 --> 02:22:17,040
It was stuff like,

5229
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:17,370
you know,

5230
02:22:17,370 --> 02:22:18,300
if cannabis,

5231
02:22:18,301 --> 02:22:20,490
if you have a family history
of severe mental illness,

5232
02:22:20,520 --> 02:22:22,170
you probably should not use cannabis.

5233
02:22:22,460 --> 02:22:23,010
Um,

5234
02:22:23,010 --> 02:22:23,611
you probably,

5235
02:22:23,611 --> 02:22:25,890
you should not use camp or try to your use

5236
02:22:26,220 --> 02:22:27,270
until you're in your 20s,

5237
02:22:27,271 --> 02:22:28,104
I think was one of them.

5238
02:22:28,260 --> 02:22:29,640
And one of them I thought,

5239
02:22:29,650 --> 02:22:32,010
I couldn't believe I was
getting pushed back on this was,

5240
02:22:32,340 --> 02:22:33,270
was something like,

5241
02:22:33,640 --> 02:22:34,230
uh,

5242
02:22:34,230 --> 02:22:34,680
if,

5243
02:22:34,680 --> 02:22:36,630
if you're having strange,

5244
02:22:36,660 --> 02:22:37,050
uh,

5245
02:22:37,050 --> 02:22:37,680
thoughts,

5246
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:39,180
especially paranoid thoughts,

5247
02:22:39,181 --> 02:22:40,320
will using cannabis,

5248
02:22:40,710 --> 02:22:41,310
um,

5249
02:22:41,310 --> 02:22:44,640
the drug may be increasing your risk
for severe mental illness and you should

5250
02:22:44,641 --> 02:22:45,474
not use it.

5251
02:22:45,480 --> 02:22:45,661
I mean,

5252
02:22:45,661 --> 02:22:46,494
I think that's,

5253
02:22:46,500 --> 02:22:47,550
I think if you know,

5254
02:22:47,580 --> 02:22:47,911
now look,

5255
02:22:47,911 --> 02:22:50,430
we can argue about how severe severe is,

5256
02:22:50,431 --> 02:22:50,701
right?

5257
02:22:50,701 --> 02:22:52,980
But certainly if you wind up in the er,

5258
02:22:53,130 --> 02:22:53,963
even once,

5259
02:22:54,210 --> 02:22:56,190
that's a bad sign and I just,

5260
02:22:56,370 --> 02:22:58,550
I just don't understand why
the legalization can be,

5261
02:22:58,600 --> 02:22:58,801
look,

5262
02:22:58,801 --> 02:23:02,010
I can understand why people who
are selling this drug don't care.

5263
02:23:02,040 --> 02:23:02,251
Right?

5264
02:23:02,251 --> 02:23:03,720
We know if you know,

5265
02:23:03,810 --> 02:23:05,070
if tobacco is taught us,

5266
02:23:05,071 --> 02:23:06,900
one thing is that when
you're selling a product,

5267
02:23:07,140 --> 02:23:09,240
you will sell it to people
even if it kills them.

5268
02:23:09,300 --> 02:23:09,990
Okay.

5269
02:23:09,990 --> 02:23:14,610
But I don't understand why these people
who are supposed to be science driven

5270
02:23:14,670 --> 02:23:18,660
and supposed to be thinking about the
greater good won't agree to reasonable

5271
02:23:18,690 --> 02:23:21,210
discussions about the what the
warnings should be on this.

5272
02:23:21,240 --> 02:23:25,200
I think you did yourself a slight
disservice by not including some of the

5273
02:23:25,201 --> 02:23:26,940
beneficial aspects of cannabis.

5274
02:23:26,941 --> 02:23:28,140
I understand your perspective.

5275
02:23:28,141 --> 02:23:30,660
I understand why you were doing that
because you really wanted to highlight the

5276
02:23:30,661 --> 02:23:31,111
dangerous,

5277
02:23:31,111 --> 02:23:34,050
but I think that's one of the things
that they can point to when they say you

5278
02:23:34,051 --> 02:23:34,980
cherry picked data.

5279
02:23:35,550 --> 02:23:39,870
But I think that also it's
really important to when
you're having these kinds of

5280
02:23:39,871 --> 02:23:41,580
conversations to have a long one.

5281
02:23:41,940 --> 02:23:42,421
I mean this,

5282
02:23:42,421 --> 02:23:44,640
we've really covered the full gamut.

5283
02:23:44,700 --> 02:23:44,980
Yes.

5284
02:23:44,980 --> 02:23:45,390
Right.

5285
02:23:45,390 --> 02:23:48,090
And I think that's probably one of the
reasons why bill Maher didn't want to

5286
02:23:48,091 --> 02:23:50,700
have you on because he's got
five other people on the panel.

5287
02:23:50,700 --> 02:23:53,730
Everybody's talking over everybody and
you have five minutes to get your case

5288
02:23:53,731 --> 02:23:53,971
out.

5289
02:23:53,971 --> 02:23:55,110
And I don't think it's possible.

5290
02:23:55,350 --> 02:23:56,280
I think this is a really,

5291
02:23:56,700 --> 02:24:01,700
this is a long complicated discussion
that has to do with biological variability

5292
02:24:01,891 --> 02:24:04,860
is it has to do with unique
situations with human,

5293
02:24:04,890 --> 02:24:05,270
uh,

5294
02:24:05,270 --> 02:24:07,110
the human psychology,

5295
02:24:07,111 --> 02:24:08,610
the way the brain functions,

5296
02:24:08,611 --> 02:24:13,140
whether or not it can act as a trigger
to schizophrenia where someone may not

5297
02:24:13,141 --> 02:24:14,790
have ever experienced
that trigger without it.

5298
02:24:14,940 --> 02:24:18,180
Maybe if they just became a long distance
runner and they would have lived a

5299
02:24:18,181 --> 02:24:20,160
healthy life with no
psychotic breaks at all,

5300
02:24:20,161 --> 02:24:21,180
we don't really know.

5301
02:24:21,330 --> 02:24:22,081
And unfortunately,

5302
02:24:22,081 --> 02:24:23,670
once someone goes off the deep end,

5303
02:24:23,671 --> 02:24:24,840
we might never find out.

5304
02:24:25,230 --> 02:24:26,370
And sorry,

5305
02:24:26,371 --> 02:24:26,700
go on.

5306
02:24:26,700 --> 02:24:26,881
No,

5307
02:24:26,881 --> 02:24:27,450
I'm just saying,

5308
02:24:27,450 --> 02:24:32,450
I think we have to be very careful
in saying we know what it does.

5309
02:24:33,091 --> 02:24:34,320
We know what anything does.

5310
02:24:34,321 --> 02:24:35,220
Cause you don't know,

5311
02:24:35,370 --> 02:24:36,660
you know what it does for you.

5312
02:24:36,930 --> 02:24:37,171
You know,

5313
02:24:37,171 --> 02:24:37,530
some,

5314
02:24:37,530 --> 02:24:39,300
some people can't eat fish,

5315
02:24:39,600 --> 02:24:39,871
you know,

5316
02:24:39,871 --> 02:24:40,061
they,

5317
02:24:40,061 --> 02:24:40,301
they,

5318
02:24:40,301 --> 02:24:41,820
they fucking shellfish and their,

5319
02:24:41,821 --> 02:24:43,110
their throats seizes up.

5320
02:24:43,350 --> 02:24:43,621
We,

5321
02:24:43,621 --> 02:24:47,130
there's so many variables when
it comes to the human body,

5322
02:24:47,310 --> 02:24:50,130
whether it's your genetics or you know,

5323
02:24:50,240 --> 02:24:54,150
w what you've eaten in the past
and how it's shaped your gut biome.

5324
02:24:54,360 --> 02:24:59,190
There's so much that we don't know and
don't understand about how we interact

5325
02:24:59,191 --> 02:25:01,710
with all the various substances
that we take into our body.

5326
02:25:01,770 --> 02:25:02,150
Yes.

5327
02:25:02,150 --> 02:25:02,550
Yeah.

5328
02:25:02,550 --> 02:25:03,940
What one thing though too,

5329
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:04,300
you know,

5330
02:25:04,300 --> 02:25:05,220
I noticed in your book,

5331
02:25:05,250 --> 02:25:05,581
Alex,

5332
02:25:05,581 --> 02:25:06,000
is that,

5333
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:06,211
you know,

5334
02:25:06,211 --> 02:25:09,840
you said that you didn't think that
cannabis can help the opioid epidemic.

5335
02:25:09,841 --> 02:25:10,290
Is that true?

5336
02:25:10,290 --> 02:25:14,460
I certainly don't think it's a good idea
for people who are at risk of opioid

5337
02:25:14,461 --> 02:25:15,240
use.

5338
02:25:15,240 --> 02:25:15,571
Okay.

5339
02:25:15,571 --> 02:25:16,140
So,

5340
02:25:16,140 --> 02:25:16,470
you know,

5341
02:25:16,470 --> 02:25:19,200
I have seen a lot of
people in my practice,

5342
02:25:19,220 --> 02:25:19,470
um,

5343
02:25:19,470 --> 02:25:22,350
come off of opioids with
cannabis use and there are,

5344
02:25:22,540 --> 02:25:22,820
you know,

5345
02:25:22,820 --> 02:25:23,980
various medical studies

5346
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:26,470
that do show that people who use cannabis,

5347
02:25:26,471 --> 02:25:29,080
Kane came replace opioids,

5348
02:25:29,290 --> 02:25:29,710
uh,

5349
02:25:29,710 --> 02:25:30,340
with,

5350
02:25:30,340 --> 02:25:31,490
with the cannabis space.

5351
02:25:31,510 --> 02:25:33,540
Folks feel though that that's a pen in,

5352
02:25:33,560 --> 02:25:33,770
you know,

5353
02:25:33,770 --> 02:25:37,600
in defense of that does just a patch and
they're really the best way to get off

5354
02:25:37,601 --> 02:25:38,890
of opiates as a game.

5355
02:25:39,300 --> 02:25:41,520
And then I became w w the,

5356
02:25:41,550 --> 02:25:46,240
the repeat rate of addiction where people
try it again afterwards is really low.

5357
02:25:46,390 --> 02:25:47,223
I think,

5358
02:25:47,470 --> 02:25:47,741
you know,

5359
02:25:47,741 --> 02:25:50,500
one of the things with that
is just the accessibility,

5360
02:25:50,530 --> 02:25:51,460
the affordability.

5361
02:25:51,461 --> 02:25:54,530
Like I've never administered
Ibogaine before.

5362
02:25:54,660 --> 02:25:55,493
Um,

5363
02:25:55,940 --> 02:25:57,280
it's illegal in the United States,

5364
02:25:57,281 --> 02:25:58,330
but I mean,

5365
02:25:58,420 --> 02:26:01,900
and it's a particularly
ruthless medication that
I've never tried personally,

5366
02:26:02,170 --> 02:26:03,580
but the people that I
know that have tried it,

5367
02:26:03,581 --> 02:26:05,080
I've had spectacular results,

5368
02:26:05,081 --> 02:26:08,460
especially people that have had
problems with pills and fracked.

5369
02:26:08,470 --> 02:26:09,131
A friend of mine,

5370
02:26:09,131 --> 02:26:09,941
my friend Ed Clay,

5371
02:26:09,941 --> 02:26:13,420
he opened up a clinic in Mexico
based on his own interaction with,

5372
02:26:13,421 --> 02:26:13,631
uh,

5373
02:26:13,631 --> 02:26:14,464
with pills.

5374
02:26:14,620 --> 02:26:15,670
He had an injury.

5375
02:26:15,671 --> 02:26:18,880
He got hooked on the pills and
a really had a fucking problem.

5376
02:26:18,881 --> 02:26:22,900
So went down to Mexico and went through
an Ibogaine a session and cured him.

5377
02:26:22,930 --> 02:26:23,770
Just whacked it out.

5378
02:26:23,771 --> 02:26:24,550
Did it change,

5379
02:26:24,550 --> 02:26:28,060
literally changes the way your brain
interfaces with your addiction?

5380
02:26:28,061 --> 02:26:28,750
It's not,

5381
02:26:28,750 --> 02:26:30,970
it's not simply a prospective enhancer.

5382
02:26:31,320 --> 02:26:31,710
It looks,

5383
02:26:31,710 --> 02:26:31,881
it,

5384
02:26:31,881 --> 02:26:33,580
it changes how you,

5385
02:26:33,610 --> 02:26:35,800
your body and your brain deal with,

5386
02:26:36,010 --> 02:26:36,843
with opiates.

5387
02:26:36,880 --> 02:26:40,600
I think a Tim Ferriss is actually
talked about that before as well.

5388
02:26:40,780 --> 02:26:41,613
Um,

5389
02:26:41,920 --> 02:26:42,461
but I mean,

5390
02:26:42,461 --> 02:26:42,790
you know,

5391
02:26:42,790 --> 02:26:46,030
I've seen it in my practice
and there are medical studies,

5392
02:26:46,031 --> 02:26:48,670
so I don't think that we
should throw out the fact that,

5393
02:26:48,910 --> 02:26:49,240
um,

5394
02:26:49,240 --> 02:26:49,421
you know,

5395
02:26:49,421 --> 02:26:52,000
cannabis can can help the opioid crisis.

5396
02:26:52,001 --> 02:26:52,950
And then also too,

5397
02:26:53,140 --> 02:26:53,330
you know,

5398
02:26:53,330 --> 02:26:56,140
you want to look at it from
a clinical perspective,

5399
02:26:56,141 --> 02:26:56,351
right?

5400
02:26:56,351 --> 02:26:58,780
So we know that opioids can kill people,

5401
02:26:58,781 --> 02:26:59,020
right?

5402
02:26:59,020 --> 02:27:00,070
Because it acts on the brain.

5403
02:27:00,071 --> 02:27:00,730
Stann whereas,

5404
02:27:00,730 --> 02:27:01,210
whereas,

5405
02:27:01,210 --> 02:27:01,391
you know,

5406
02:27:01,391 --> 02:27:02,380
cannabis doesn't,

5407
02:27:02,620 --> 02:27:03,220
so,

5408
02:27:03,220 --> 02:27:03,551
you know,

5409
02:27:03,551 --> 02:27:04,540
you might be saying,

5410
02:27:04,541 --> 02:27:04,691
you know,

5411
02:27:04,691 --> 02:27:07,090
you're just substituting
one for the other.

5412
02:27:07,330 --> 02:27:07,631
And you know,

5413
02:27:07,631 --> 02:27:09,190
sometimes that is true,

5414
02:27:09,400 --> 02:27:12,190
but if you're using a
less harmful substance,

5415
02:27:12,340 --> 02:27:12,551
you know,

5416
02:27:12,551 --> 02:27:14,440
to me that's like a huge win,

5417
02:27:14,680 --> 02:27:14,891
right?

5418
02:27:14,891 --> 02:27:16,250
So if someone you know,

5419
02:27:16,270 --> 02:27:21,270
has to drink 12 beers a night
versus smoking like one joint,

5420
02:27:21,430 --> 02:27:21,761
man,

5421
02:27:21,761 --> 02:27:23,050
that's awesome.

5422
02:27:23,060 --> 02:27:23,351
I mean,

5423
02:27:23,351 --> 02:27:24,011
you look at all,

5424
02:27:24,011 --> 02:27:26,650
all these clinics like you
look at like Methadone clinics.

5425
02:27:26,651 --> 02:27:26,891
I mean,

5426
02:27:26,891 --> 02:27:27,780
what are they doing there?

5427
02:27:27,781 --> 02:27:30,640
They're trying to get
people off one substance to,

5428
02:27:30,670 --> 02:27:30,881
you know,

5429
02:27:30,881 --> 02:27:33,520
a substance that is a
little bit less harmful.

5430
02:27:33,790 --> 02:27:34,960
And I think that when you,

5431
02:27:34,961 --> 02:27:36,070
when you use cannabis,

5432
02:27:36,210 --> 02:27:36,431
you know,

5433
02:27:36,431 --> 02:27:37,540
it can be effective,

5434
02:27:37,590 --> 02:27:37,840
uh,

5435
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:38,050
for,

5436
02:27:38,050 --> 02:27:38,883
for opioids.

5437
02:27:39,010 --> 02:27:40,170
It can also be effective for,

5438
02:27:40,171 --> 02:27:42,790
for benzodiazepines and for
other medicines as well.

5439
02:27:42,790 --> 02:27:43,390
So,

5440
02:27:43,390 --> 02:27:44,140
you know,

5441
02:27:44,140 --> 02:27:46,690
I would it be awesome
if everyone would just,

5442
02:27:46,691 --> 02:27:46,931
you know,

5443
02:27:46,931 --> 02:27:51,700
feel happy and great all the time by
just exercise and nutrition and you know,

5444
02:27:51,701 --> 02:27:54,880
that's what I advocate and that's
what I try to do personally.

5445
02:27:54,881 --> 02:27:55,840
And that's what I try to,

5446
02:27:55,950 --> 02:27:56,170
you know,

5447
02:27:56,170 --> 02:27:58,210
say to my patients all the time.

5448
02:27:58,540 --> 02:28:00,280
But I understand though that,

5449
02:28:00,310 --> 02:28:00,521
you know,

5450
02:28:00,521 --> 02:28:02,320
sometimes life is hard.

5451
02:28:02,321 --> 02:28:03,130
Sometimes,

5452
02:28:03,130 --> 02:28:03,341
you know,

5453
02:28:03,341 --> 02:28:04,360
if things hit you,

5454
02:28:04,510 --> 02:28:04,721
you know,

5455
02:28:04,721 --> 02:28:05,171
you have,

5456
02:28:05,171 --> 02:28:06,280
you have crisis in your life,

5457
02:28:06,281 --> 02:28:06,760
you have,

5458
02:28:06,760 --> 02:28:06,971
you know,

5459
02:28:06,971 --> 02:28:10,780
personal crisis that can throw off your
mental health and then you have your get

5460
02:28:10,781 --> 02:28:11,920
into a car accident,

5461
02:28:11,950 --> 02:28:12,430
you know,

5462
02:28:12,430 --> 02:28:14,230
and you could be in really severe pain.

5463
02:28:14,231 --> 02:28:14,541
And,

5464
02:28:14,541 --> 02:28:15,730
and in those times,

5465
02:28:16,090 --> 02:28:16,301
you know,

5466
02:28:16,301 --> 02:28:17,650
sometimes diet,

5467
02:28:17,740 --> 02:28:18,580
exercise,

5468
02:28:18,790 --> 02:28:19,780
meditation,

5469
02:28:19,810 --> 02:28:23,000
doing all the right things
just isn't quite enough.

5470
02:28:23,210 --> 02:28:23,841
And you know,

5471
02:28:23,841 --> 02:28:28,310
I think that it's great that we have
cannabis for those situations because it

5472
02:28:28,311 --> 02:28:29,420
does seem to be,

5473
02:28:29,540 --> 02:28:29,811
you know,

5474
02:28:29,811 --> 02:28:34,730
very effective and has less side effects
compared to some of the other metals is

5475
02:28:35,450 --> 02:28:38,570
compared to some of the other medicines
that we have traditionally used.

5476
02:28:38,840 --> 02:28:39,320
Um,

5477
02:28:39,320 --> 02:28:39,861
and you know,

5478
02:28:39,861 --> 02:28:40,430
even though,

5479
02:28:40,430 --> 02:28:40,611
you know,

5480
02:28:40,611 --> 02:28:42,470
I'm talking about opiates and deaths,

5481
02:28:42,950 --> 02:28:43,340
you know,

5482
02:28:43,340 --> 02:28:45,100
we can also talk about insets,

5483
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:45,351
right?

5484
02:28:45,351 --> 02:28:47,090
Like nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.

5485
02:28:47,270 --> 02:28:49,880
So these drugs can also,

5486
02:28:49,910 --> 02:28:50,181
you know,

5487
02:28:50,181 --> 02:28:51,950
wreck havoc on your GI system.

5488
02:28:52,210 --> 02:28:52,550
Um,

5489
02:28:52,550 --> 02:28:53,540
I saw one study,

5490
02:28:53,541 --> 02:28:53,811
actually,

5491
02:28:53,811 --> 02:28:54,644
I tweeted out,

5492
02:28:54,710 --> 02:28:55,280
uh,

5493
02:28:55,280 --> 02:28:58,820
Rhonda Patrick tweeted out said
that if you use a and sets,

5494
02:28:58,821 --> 02:28:59,750
it was really short.

5495
02:28:59,751 --> 02:29:00,860
I got to look it up again,

5496
02:29:00,861 --> 02:29:02,180
but it was like two weeks.

5497
02:29:02,181 --> 02:29:03,410
It can decrease your,

5498
02:29:03,411 --> 02:29:03,680
uh,

5499
02:29:03,680 --> 02:29:04,700
your gonadotropins,

5500
02:29:04,910 --> 02:29:08,000
which can stimulate your
testosterone level by like 25%.

5501
02:29:08,360 --> 02:29:09,320
And on that note too,

5502
02:29:09,321 --> 02:29:10,154
we should talk about,

5503
02:29:10,290 --> 02:29:11,630
I can't believe I forgot
to talk about this,

5504
02:29:11,631 --> 02:29:14,180
but opioids can drastically,

5505
02:29:14,420 --> 02:29:15,020
um,

5506
02:29:15,020 --> 02:29:15,801
inhibit your,

5507
02:29:15,801 --> 02:29:16,070
uh,

5508
02:29:16,070 --> 02:29:16,441
your,

5509
02:29:16,441 --> 02:29:16,550
uh,

5510
02:29:16,550 --> 02:29:17,660
testosterone production.

5511
02:29:17,690 --> 02:29:18,110
Right?

5512
02:29:18,110 --> 02:29:23,110
Which is a huge thing for
depression because I've had
guys come in to me before,

5513
02:29:23,350 --> 02:29:23,720
um,

5514
02:29:23,720 --> 02:29:25,220
that have been a really,

5515
02:29:25,221 --> 02:29:26,054
really depressed,

5516
02:29:26,200 --> 02:29:28,460
you just give them a small
amount of testosterone in men.

5517
02:29:28,490 --> 02:29:30,620
They're off their antidepressants
and they're off to the races.

5518
02:29:30,800 --> 02:29:31,633
They're doing great.

5519
02:29:31,790 --> 02:29:32,510
So,

5520
02:29:32,510 --> 02:29:32,781
you know,

5521
02:29:32,781 --> 02:29:35,000
are we creating a lot of people who are,

5522
02:29:35,030 --> 02:29:39,380
who are depressed because they're using
opiates and their testosterone levels

5523
02:29:39,381 --> 02:29:40,190
are low.

5524
02:29:40,190 --> 02:29:40,581
And you know,

5525
02:29:40,581 --> 02:29:41,270
for men,

5526
02:29:41,270 --> 02:29:42,420
I mean having low testosterone,

5527
02:29:42,421 --> 02:29:43,251
it's horrible.

5528
02:29:43,251 --> 02:29:43,431
You know,

5529
02:29:43,431 --> 02:29:44,900
your libido goes,

5530
02:29:44,901 --> 02:29:45,171
you know what,

5531
02:29:45,171 --> 02:29:46,700
you're going to have low motivation.

5532
02:29:46,920 --> 02:29:47,240
Um,

5533
02:29:47,240 --> 02:29:47,421
you know,

5534
02:29:47,421 --> 02:29:48,560
you're not going to feel as well,

5535
02:29:48,561 --> 02:29:49,670
you're not gonna want to do things.

5536
02:29:49,850 --> 02:29:50,300
So,

5537
02:29:50,300 --> 02:29:50,690
you know,

5538
02:29:50,690 --> 02:29:51,230
um,

5539
02:29:51,230 --> 02:29:53,110
if you're giving someone a medicine that,

5540
02:29:53,300 --> 02:29:53,630
that,

5541
02:29:53,630 --> 02:29:54,341
that nails there,

5542
02:29:54,341 --> 02:29:55,730
their testosterone levels down,

5543
02:29:55,940 --> 02:29:58,610
that's gonna really wreck wreck,

5544
02:29:58,611 --> 02:29:59,900
wreck havoc on their mental health.

5545
02:30:00,270 --> 02:30:04,010
And I just want to make a note to
cause Ben Greenfield who again,

5546
02:30:04,040 --> 02:30:04,401
I really,

5547
02:30:04,401 --> 02:30:05,061
really respect.

5548
02:30:05,061 --> 02:30:05,990
I like that guy a lot.

5549
02:30:06,340 --> 02:30:06,830
Um,

5550
02:30:06,830 --> 02:30:07,101
you know,

5551
02:30:07,101 --> 02:30:10,120
it was talking a little bit with
you about testosterone and um,

5552
02:30:10,700 --> 02:30:11,570
and uh,

5553
02:30:11,670 --> 02:30:11,820
and,

5554
02:30:11,820 --> 02:30:12,081
and,

5555
02:30:12,081 --> 02:30:13,430
and cannabis and how it can drop it.

5556
02:30:13,670 --> 02:30:16,820
So I think there was three
studies I saw done on,

5557
02:30:16,870 --> 02:30:17,703
on humans,

5558
02:30:17,930 --> 02:30:18,590
um,

5559
02:30:18,590 --> 02:30:23,590
and two of them a note at no statistical
difference and drop into Saas and

5560
02:30:24,191 --> 02:30:26,030
levels and one study.

5561
02:30:26,031 --> 02:30:28,940
The other study noted a
small statistical difference.

5562
02:30:29,240 --> 02:30:29,750
Um,

5563
02:30:29,750 --> 02:30:30,430
so,

5564
02:30:30,430 --> 02:30:30,710
you know,

5565
02:30:30,710 --> 02:30:31,490
I think that,

5566
02:30:31,490 --> 02:30:31,720
you know,

5567
02:30:31,720 --> 02:30:34,670
it may drop your testosterone
levels a little bit,

5568
02:30:34,671 --> 02:30:35,700
but it's not gonna,

5569
02:30:35,740 --> 02:30:35,991
you know,

5570
02:30:35,991 --> 02:30:37,700
substantially drop them.

5571
02:30:37,701 --> 02:30:38,720
So just so people,

5572
02:30:38,750 --> 02:30:40,910
people know know that
because I know that comes up,

5573
02:30:41,110 --> 02:30:41,840
um,

5574
02:30:41,840 --> 02:30:42,590
all the time,

5575
02:30:42,590 --> 02:30:43,423
you know.

5576
02:30:43,760 --> 02:30:44,041
Yes.

5577
02:30:44,041 --> 02:30:44,540
There's the,

5578
02:30:44,540 --> 02:30:45,290
as the,

5579
02:30:45,290 --> 02:30:48,530
as the dumb anti drug advocates
like to say doobies caused boobies.

5580
02:30:52,390 --> 02:30:53,850
That is not right.

5581
02:30:54,170 --> 02:30:57,460
There's no goal associated with that.

5582
02:30:57,680 --> 02:30:58,513
No,

5583
02:30:58,820 --> 02:30:59,653
I'm joking.

5584
02:31:00,010 --> 02:31:00,530
Um,

5585
02:31:00,530 --> 02:31:01,740
risperdol causes,

5586
02:31:02,630 --> 02:31:03,620
that's a different issue.

5587
02:31:04,420 --> 02:31:05,720
Respire Dawson anti psychotic,

5588
02:31:05,730 --> 02:31:06,563
but spirits.

5589
02:31:07,240 --> 02:31:07,850
So,

5590
02:31:07,850 --> 02:31:08,780
so look,

5591
02:31:09,680 --> 02:31:10,513
I think,

5592
02:31:10,700 --> 02:31:13,850
I think the issue of whether
cannabis is a gateway drug,

5593
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,810
it's 100% clear that
cannabis is a gateway drug.

5594
02:31:17,990 --> 02:31:20,730
The argument is we say has a hundred
percent a hundred percent clear.

5595
02:31:20,850 --> 02:31:21,750
The argument is why.

5596
02:31:21,810 --> 02:31:22,380
Okay,

5597
02:31:22,380 --> 02:31:23,130
so the,

5598
02:31:23,130 --> 02:31:28,130
so it's quite clear that cannabis use
oftentimes proceeds other drug use,

5599
02:31:28,650 --> 02:31:29,461
whether it's opioids,

5600
02:31:29,461 --> 02:31:29,970
cocaine,

5601
02:31:29,970 --> 02:31:30,803
other drugs.

5602
02:31:30,810 --> 02:31:32,580
Now one argument,

5603
02:31:32,581 --> 02:31:34,500
and this is actually a
pro legalization argument,

5604
02:31:34,501 --> 02:31:38,910
is one reason it's a gateway
is that if it's illegal,

5605
02:31:38,911 --> 02:31:40,980
you got to buy it from your
friendly neighborhood dealer.

5606
02:31:41,130 --> 02:31:43,380
He might have access to heroin or cocaine,

5607
02:31:43,381 --> 02:31:44,214
other drugs.

5608
02:31:44,370 --> 02:31:47,850
And so eventually maybe you decide
to try one of those other drugs.

5609
02:31:47,850 --> 02:31:49,720
So actually that's really
why the Dutch legalized,

5610
02:31:49,740 --> 02:31:54,120
they wanted to create an avenue for people
to use cannabis that wasn't connected

5611
02:31:54,121 --> 02:31:55,500
to other drugs.

5612
02:31:55,560 --> 02:31:56,393
Okay.

5613
02:31:56,400 --> 02:31:59,940
Another possibility is that using
an addictive intoxicating substance,

5614
02:32:00,580 --> 02:32:03,270
you might like it and you might
want to try other addictive,

5615
02:32:03,271 --> 02:32:05,610
intoxicating substances and
it might prime your brain.

5616
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:09,420
And then the third possibility really
is that they're just some people who are

5617
02:32:09,421 --> 02:32:10,410
risk takers out there,

5618
02:32:10,440 --> 02:32:10,741
right?

5619
02:32:10,741 --> 02:32:11,520
They use,

5620
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:12,660
they're going to use cannabis,

5621
02:32:12,661 --> 02:32:13,530
they're going to gamble,

5622
02:32:13,531 --> 02:32:17,340
they're going to in cannabis is a little
bit easier to access than other drugs.

5623
02:32:17,341 --> 02:32:19,380
So they're probably going
to try cannabis first.

5624
02:32:19,410 --> 02:32:22,710
So it's not really that that
cannabis drives the use,

5625
02:32:22,711 --> 02:32:24,150
it's just the cannabis is first.

5626
02:32:24,180 --> 02:32:25,260
They're just curious people.

5627
02:32:25,430 --> 02:32:26,570
What's your thoughts on,

5628
02:32:26,730 --> 02:32:27,240
well,

5629
02:32:27,240 --> 02:32:27,991
what I will say,

5630
02:32:27,991 --> 02:32:30,330
I mean I'm just going to
go back to the NAM report,

5631
02:32:30,331 --> 02:32:30,600
right?

5632
02:32:30,600 --> 02:32:30,990
And I mean,

5633
02:32:30,990 --> 02:32:33,600
I mean you quoted these
people in your book,

5634
02:32:33,970 --> 02:32:34,440
um,

5635
02:32:34,440 --> 02:32:34,681
you know,

5636
02:32:34,681 --> 02:32:38,820
so this committee couldn't find sufficient
data demonstrating an association

5637
02:32:38,821 --> 02:32:41,040
between cannabis use and
initially the opioid use,

5638
02:32:41,190 --> 02:32:44,670
they found no compelling evidence
to support the gateway drug theory.

5639
02:32:44,671 --> 02:32:45,210
So,

5640
02:32:45,210 --> 02:32:46,043
so again,

5641
02:32:46,290 --> 02:32:48,750
but that's the goal was the people
that you quoted in your book.

5642
02:32:48,751 --> 02:32:50,940
So there's been more
research done since then,

5643
02:32:51,660 --> 02:32:53,340
but what is have radically changed?

5644
02:32:53,370 --> 02:32:54,960
I would say things have changed some,

5645
02:32:55,020 --> 02:32:55,321
here's,

5646
02:32:55,321 --> 02:32:55,681
here's,

5647
02:32:55,681 --> 02:32:56,550
here's what I would rather say.

5648
02:32:56,551 --> 02:32:59,250
I think that probably it's a
combination of these things,

5649
02:32:59,251 --> 02:32:59,760
right?

5650
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:01,830
There's certainly an
environmental factor where again,

5651
02:33:01,831 --> 02:33:05,400
if you're buying from somebody who's
got an access to other illegal drugs,

5652
02:33:05,401 --> 02:33:09,270
maybe you try those drugs at
the same time getting high,

5653
02:33:09,271 --> 02:33:12,690
it feels good and maybe you want to try
other drugs and at the same time you're

5654
02:33:12,691 --> 02:33:13,524
just a risk taker.

5655
02:33:13,620 --> 02:33:14,430
Okay.

5656
02:33:14,430 --> 02:33:15,210
What is,

5657
02:33:15,210 --> 02:33:20,210
what nobody seriously ever said until
about the last five years is that cannabis

5658
02:33:20,491 --> 02:33:22,410
could be an off ramp for opioids.

5659
02:33:22,440 --> 02:33:22,980
Okay?

5660
02:33:22,980 --> 02:33:25,650
And there's a lot of reasons to
believe that's a really bad idea.

5661
02:33:25,830 --> 02:33:26,663
First of all,

5662
02:33:26,760 --> 02:33:27,211
cannabis,

5663
02:33:27,211 --> 02:33:29,100
if you actually need
opioids for pain relief,

5664
02:33:29,101 --> 02:33:31,020
canvas is not a good enough pain reliever.

5665
02:33:31,050 --> 02:33:31,801
It's like alcohol.

5666
02:33:31,801 --> 02:33:33,180
It's a mild pain reliever.

5667
02:33:33,181 --> 02:33:34,320
It's not strong enough.

5668
02:33:34,350 --> 02:33:35,370
You're dying from cancer.

5669
02:33:35,610 --> 02:33:38,850
Cannabis probably is not the
pain reliever that you need.

5670
02:33:38,851 --> 02:33:39,780
You need opioids,

5671
02:33:39,810 --> 02:33:40,530
okay.

5672
02:33:40,530 --> 02:33:41,910
And again,

5673
02:33:41,911 --> 02:33:43,890
the state level data is not as good.

5674
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:47,250
If you want to really figure out
what's happening to an individual,

5675
02:33:47,370 --> 02:33:50,070
the best way to do that is
to follow that individual.

5676
02:33:50,130 --> 02:33:53,970
And there's a really good paper that came
out in 2017 after the NAM reports that

5677
02:33:53,971 --> 02:33:54,870
they didn't have it.

5678
02:33:55,320 --> 02:34:00,320
That shows that people who used cannabis
in 2001 this is based on a large

5679
02:34:00,661 --> 02:34:05,661
national study in the U S we're three
times as likely to be using opioids three

5680
02:34:06,151 --> 02:34:06,984
years later.

5681
02:34:07,020 --> 02:34:07,351
Okay.

5682
02:34:07,351 --> 02:34:09,240
And that just intuitively
makes sense to me.

5683
02:34:09,360 --> 02:34:12,990
And the other thing that people on the
legalization side don't ever talk about

5684
02:34:12,991 --> 02:34:16,980
is who are the two countries that have
the most cannabis use in the west,

5685
02:34:17,260 --> 02:34:18,340
the US and Canada?

5686
02:34:18,520 --> 02:34:19,353
Where are the two?

5687
02:34:19,360 --> 02:34:20,590
Who are the two countries that have,

5688
02:34:20,591 --> 02:34:22,630
by far the worst opiod epidemic?

5689
02:34:22,840 --> 02:34:24,100
The U S and Canada.

5690
02:34:24,130 --> 02:34:24,371
Okay.

5691
02:34:24,371 --> 02:34:27,280
But there's a real issue with that
because the United States is also the only

5692
02:34:27,281 --> 02:34:31,450
country other than New Zealand that
allows pharmaceutical companies advertise.

5693
02:34:31,451 --> 02:34:32,320
I mean there's a,

5694
02:34:32,321 --> 02:34:33,760
there's the amount,

5695
02:34:33,761 --> 02:34:34,270
it doesn't,

5696
02:34:34,270 --> 02:34:37,180
the amount of opiates that are
prescribed the United States is fucking

5697
02:34:37,181 --> 02:34:37,930
preposterous.

5698
02:34:37,930 --> 02:34:38,471
I agree.

5699
02:34:38,471 --> 02:34:39,800
Particularly if he,

5700
02:34:39,810 --> 02:34:41,110
I don't know if you ever
saw the documentary,

5701
02:34:41,111 --> 02:34:42,310
the Oxycontin Express,

5702
02:34:42,520 --> 02:34:45,400
but the way Florida used to be structured
where they didn't have a database,

5703
02:34:46,450 --> 02:34:48,880
you could just literally go
from pharmacy to pharmacy.

5704
02:34:48,900 --> 02:34:52,810
Yet we have a problem with the way
we prescribed drugs in this country.

5705
02:34:52,811 --> 02:34:54,310
Opioids add drugs,

5706
02:34:54,311 --> 02:34:54,930
Benzos,

5707
02:34:54,930 --> 02:34:55,760
ssrs,

5708
02:34:55,760 --> 02:34:57,190
all were connected to Canada.

5709
02:34:57,240 --> 02:34:59,200
So it makes sense that it
would filter over there.

5710
02:34:59,260 --> 02:34:59,651
Yes.

5711
02:34:59,651 --> 02:35:03,550
But what I would say is the people who
think that cannabis is not part of that

5712
02:35:03,551 --> 02:35:06,790
overprescribing problem
are deluding themselves.

5713
02:35:07,290 --> 02:35:08,140
And what do you think to that?

5714
02:35:08,680 --> 02:35:08,951
So he,

5715
02:35:08,951 --> 02:35:10,030
can you repeat the question again?

5716
02:35:10,070 --> 02:35:10,350
So,

5717
02:35:10,350 --> 02:35:11,030
so,

5718
02:35:11,030 --> 02:35:11,691
so I,

5719
02:35:11,691 --> 02:35:16,460
I agree with Joe the way that
the access to opioids in the US.

5720
02:35:16,510 --> 02:35:18,790
I mean certainly it's come down a
little bit in the last couple of years,

5721
02:35:18,791 --> 02:35:19,330
but you know,

5722
02:35:19,330 --> 02:35:20,141
Purdue Pharma,

5723
02:35:20,141 --> 02:35:22,120
there's a special place
in hell for those guys,

5724
02:35:22,360 --> 02:35:22,810
but not,

5725
02:35:22,810 --> 02:35:23,621
it's not just opioids.

5726
02:35:23,621 --> 02:35:24,910
We prescribed too many benzos.

5727
02:35:24,911 --> 02:35:26,950
We prescribed too many add drugs.

5728
02:35:26,980 --> 02:35:29,230
We probably prescribed too many ssrs.

5729
02:35:29,231 --> 02:35:31,300
We prescribed too much in this country.

5730
02:35:31,301 --> 02:35:32,140
I think we all agree on,

5731
02:35:32,290 --> 02:35:33,310
I agree with that.

5732
02:35:33,311 --> 02:35:34,140
I think

5733
02:35:34,140 --> 02:35:39,140
that cannabis is another example of us
looking for a drug to solve our problem.

5734
02:35:39,450 --> 02:35:39,931
But what,

5735
02:35:39,931 --> 02:35:40,830
what I'm okay,

5736
02:35:40,831 --> 02:35:41,191
again,

5737
02:35:41,191 --> 02:35:43,410
just from a clinical perspective,

5738
02:35:43,650 --> 02:35:44,220
um,

5739
02:35:44,220 --> 02:35:44,520
you know,

5740
02:35:44,520 --> 02:35:47,070
I can't just rely on,

5741
02:35:47,130 --> 02:35:49,290
on Diet and exercise for all my patients.

5742
02:35:49,320 --> 02:35:50,910
I have to use other tools.

5743
02:35:50,911 --> 02:35:51,331
And again,

5744
02:35:51,331 --> 02:35:52,860
like everyone here in this room,

5745
02:35:52,861 --> 02:35:54,420
like we're all pretty healthy.

5746
02:35:54,421 --> 02:35:56,950
I don't have a bad back or you know,

5747
02:35:56,970 --> 02:35:59,790
I don't have a mental health
diagnosis or anything going on.

5748
02:35:59,791 --> 02:36:00,300
So,

5749
02:36:00,300 --> 02:36:00,940
you know,

5750
02:36:00,940 --> 02:36:03,180
I'll have to look at patients
that are coming to me.

5751
02:36:03,210 --> 02:36:03,481
Right?

5752
02:36:03,481 --> 02:36:05,460
So the way I see it is that,

5753
02:36:05,820 --> 02:36:06,061
you know,

5754
02:36:06,061 --> 02:36:07,920
we just mentioned a bunch of other drugs,

5755
02:36:07,921 --> 02:36:08,041
you know,

5756
02:36:08,041 --> 02:36:08,821
antidepressants,

5757
02:36:08,821 --> 02:36:09,361
amphetamines,

5758
02:36:09,361 --> 02:36:10,194
all these sorts of things,

5759
02:36:10,560 --> 02:36:10,801
you know,

5760
02:36:10,801 --> 02:36:11,970
cannabis and again,

5761
02:36:11,971 --> 02:36:12,300
you know,

5762
02:36:12,300 --> 02:36:14,370
I'm going to separate
the chiefs and the CBD.

5763
02:36:15,510 --> 02:36:19,290
It's an incredible medicine
and it doesn't kill people,

5764
02:36:19,500 --> 02:36:19,771
right?

5765
02:36:19,771 --> 02:36:21,330
So as a clinician,

5766
02:36:21,600 --> 02:36:22,221
you know that,

5767
02:36:22,221 --> 02:36:26,940
that's so comforting for me to know
that every single night I go to bed,

5768
02:36:27,180 --> 02:36:28,470
I killed zero people.

5769
02:36:28,500 --> 02:36:29,220
I know that.

5770
02:36:29,220 --> 02:36:29,551
Right?

5771
02:36:29,551 --> 02:36:30,510
So that's really,

5772
02:36:30,511 --> 02:36:31,830
really comforting for me to know.

5773
02:36:32,040 --> 02:36:32,873
Also,

5774
02:36:32,880 --> 02:36:33,391
I feel,

5775
02:36:33,391 --> 02:36:33,601
you know,

5776
02:36:33,601 --> 02:36:35,130
we just talking about amphetamines,

5777
02:36:35,131 --> 02:36:36,120
so we were just talking about,

5778
02:36:36,270 --> 02:36:36,490
you know,

5779
02:36:36,490 --> 02:36:37,323
ssrs.

5780
02:36:37,530 --> 02:36:38,700
I feel that cannabis,

5781
02:36:38,701 --> 02:36:38,880
you know,

5782
02:36:38,880 --> 02:36:42,420
particularly the CBD component
can actually be more effective.

5783
02:36:42,450 --> 02:36:42,661
You know,

5784
02:36:42,661 --> 02:36:45,720
that's what I've seen a lot in my practice
and other people have seen that as

5785
02:36:45,721 --> 02:36:46,350
well.

5786
02:36:46,350 --> 02:36:46,770
So,

5787
02:36:46,770 --> 02:36:46,951
you know,

5788
02:36:46,951 --> 02:36:50,670
I think that we need to need to take
that into consideration when we're using

5789
02:36:50,880 --> 02:36:51,691
all these drugs.

5790
02:36:51,691 --> 02:36:51,861
And,

5791
02:36:51,861 --> 02:36:52,261
and Alex,

5792
02:36:52,261 --> 02:36:52,530
you know,

5793
02:36:52,530 --> 02:36:53,760
some of the things that you're saying,

5794
02:36:53,970 --> 02:36:54,660
you know,

5795
02:36:54,660 --> 02:36:55,261
they're quite,

5796
02:36:55,261 --> 02:36:55,900
you know,

5797
02:36:55,900 --> 02:36:56,240
um,

5798
02:36:56,240 --> 02:36:57,080
Aderville and,

5799
02:36:57,081 --> 02:36:59,430
and in a lot of things
like researchers say,

5800
02:36:59,610 --> 02:37:00,060
you know,

5801
02:37:00,060 --> 02:37:01,740
are quite admirable as well.

5802
02:37:01,741 --> 02:37:01,911
And,

5803
02:37:01,911 --> 02:37:02,371
and you know,

5804
02:37:02,371 --> 02:37:02,820
they,

5805
02:37:02,820 --> 02:37:03,690
they feel that they can,

5806
02:37:03,691 --> 02:37:03,871
you know,

5807
02:37:03,871 --> 02:37:04,920
tell clinicians,

5808
02:37:05,160 --> 02:37:05,521
um,

5809
02:37:05,521 --> 02:37:05,731
you know,

5810
02:37:05,731 --> 02:37:06,930
give them really good advice,

5811
02:37:06,931 --> 02:37:09,240
but they're not the ones in the trenches.

5812
02:37:09,240 --> 02:37:10,860
They're not the ones
in front of the people.

5813
02:37:10,861 --> 02:37:13,950
They're not the ones that have
to have to chat with patients.

5814
02:37:14,130 --> 02:37:14,400
You know,

5815
02:37:14,400 --> 02:37:18,620
I have obligation to do something
for my patients to make them better.

5816
02:37:18,890 --> 02:37:20,060
I really feel,

5817
02:37:20,061 --> 02:37:20,241
you know,

5818
02:37:20,241 --> 02:37:24,230
we just listed a bunch of drugs
that cannabis is a really,

5819
02:37:24,231 --> 02:37:27,830
really effective tool and
it doesn't kill anybody.

5820
02:37:27,980 --> 02:37:28,400
So,

5821
02:37:28,400 --> 02:37:28,641
you know,

5822
02:37:28,641 --> 02:37:29,474
because of that,

5823
02:37:29,570 --> 02:37:29,811
you know,

5824
02:37:29,811 --> 02:37:30,410
aren't gonna,

5825
02:37:30,410 --> 02:37:31,243
I'm gonna keep,

5826
02:37:31,340 --> 02:37:32,173
keep using it.

5827
02:37:32,270 --> 02:37:32,931
But like I said,

5828
02:37:32,931 --> 02:37:34,610
I'm always looking for other drugs.

5829
02:37:34,611 --> 02:37:35,780
I'm always looking for other,

5830
02:37:35,930 --> 02:37:36,320
you know,

5831
02:37:36,320 --> 02:37:39,410
alternatives to also help my patients.

5832
02:37:39,411 --> 02:37:40,550
But I think that,

5833
02:37:40,790 --> 02:37:41,540
you know,

5834
02:37:41,540 --> 02:37:46,540
using cannabis is a really effective
tool for a lot of clinicians and it's

5835
02:37:47,331 --> 02:37:48,470
helped a lot of patients.

5836
02:37:48,590 --> 02:37:51,230
But what do you think about his
argument about it being a gateway drug?

5837
02:37:51,260 --> 02:37:53,270
Other than what these
people said in the study,

5838
02:37:53,271 --> 02:37:55,700
that there's no evidence that
supports it to gateway drug?

5839
02:37:55,730 --> 02:37:58,130
What are your personal
feelings about that argument?

5840
02:37:58,310 --> 02:38:00,080
So I don't feel that,

5841
02:38:00,140 --> 02:38:00,351
uh,

5842
02:38:00,351 --> 02:38:01,940
that cannabis is a gateway drug.

5843
02:38:01,941 --> 02:38:03,050
I do feel that,

5844
02:38:03,080 --> 02:38:03,381
you know,

5845
02:38:03,381 --> 02:38:03,951
one of the,

5846
02:38:03,951 --> 02:38:04,240
uh,

5847
02:38:04,240 --> 02:38:05,990
things that you mentioned earlier is that,

5848
02:38:06,170 --> 02:38:06,351
you know,

5849
02:38:06,351 --> 02:38:09,950
some people kind of had this personality
where they're like an experiment,

5850
02:38:10,170 --> 02:38:10,700
right?

5851
02:38:10,700 --> 02:38:11,533
And they just,

5852
02:38:11,540 --> 02:38:12,160
they just want,

5853
02:38:12,160 --> 02:38:13,100
I want to try something.

5854
02:38:13,101 --> 02:38:13,640
So,

5855
02:38:13,640 --> 02:38:14,180
you know,

5856
02:38:14,180 --> 02:38:14,821
the fact is,

5857
02:38:14,821 --> 02:38:18,290
is that alcohol and cannabis
just get introduced first.

5858
02:38:18,291 --> 02:38:19,070
Most of the time,

5859
02:38:19,070 --> 02:38:21,370
most people don't do,

5860
02:38:21,460 --> 02:38:21,740
you know,

5861
02:38:21,740 --> 02:38:22,420
coke or,

5862
02:38:22,420 --> 02:38:23,121
or LSD.

5863
02:38:23,121 --> 02:38:24,590
And then he say,

5864
02:38:24,591 --> 02:38:25,011
hey man,

5865
02:38:25,011 --> 02:38:26,030
let us try some,

5866
02:38:26,090 --> 02:38:26,811
some cannabis.

5867
02:38:26,811 --> 02:38:27,200
Right?

5868
02:38:27,200 --> 02:38:28,033
So it's just that,

5869
02:38:28,160 --> 02:38:29,960
that's the very first one there.

5870
02:38:30,050 --> 02:38:31,040
So if we,

5871
02:38:31,041 --> 02:38:32,950
so you could say anything that,

5872
02:38:32,951 --> 02:38:34,310
that that was easier access.

5873
02:38:34,311 --> 02:38:36,470
If there were some new drug that you know,

5874
02:38:36,490 --> 02:38:40,250
did something similar to
alcohol or similar to cannabis
and that was introduced

5875
02:38:40,251 --> 02:38:40,380
in,

5876
02:38:40,380 --> 02:38:41,240
in our society,

5877
02:38:41,420 --> 02:38:43,070
you'd be calling that the gateway drug.

5878
02:38:43,700 --> 02:38:44,630
And I do feel,

5879
02:38:44,631 --> 02:38:45,050
and I,

5880
02:38:45,050 --> 02:38:49,280
I do believe that nearly been demonstrated
as being the gateway drug to almost

5881
02:38:49,281 --> 02:38:52,190
all the loosening of inhibitions.

5882
02:38:52,191 --> 02:38:54,200
Whereas the opposite could
be said about cannabis,

5883
02:38:54,350 --> 02:38:55,350
that it makes you paranoid.

5884
02:38:55,380 --> 02:38:58,760
You might actually be less
likely to try cocaine afterwards.

5885
02:38:59,120 --> 02:39:00,410
And I know that the name,

5886
02:39:00,480 --> 02:39:00,900
uh,

5887
02:39:00,900 --> 02:39:01,220
you know,

5888
02:39:01,220 --> 02:39:01,730
they don't,

5889
02:39:01,730 --> 02:39:04,400
they don't feel that the cannabis
is a gateway drug either.

5890
02:39:04,401 --> 02:39:04,641
I mean,

5891
02:39:04,641 --> 02:39:05,001
again,

5892
02:39:05,001 --> 02:39:09,500
they said they found no compelling
evidence to support the gateway theory.

5893
02:39:09,680 --> 02:39:10,191
And again,

5894
02:39:10,191 --> 02:39:13,320
I mean these are the people that
you are growing and your book out.

5895
02:39:13,470 --> 02:39:14,120
Right.

5896
02:39:14,120 --> 02:39:15,620
Let me just go a little bit further.

5897
02:39:15,710 --> 02:39:18,220
They said in a retrospective cohort study,

5898
02:39:18,470 --> 02:39:19,340
it may,

5899
02:39:19,341 --> 02:39:23,930
it from e t a l and the 2016 examine
that transition from cannabis use to the

5900
02:39:23,931 --> 02:39:25,250
use of other elicit drugs.

5901
02:39:25,490 --> 02:39:29,330
They found that the probability
of initiating other elicit
drugs after cannabis

5902
02:39:29,540 --> 02:39:34,370
did not differ significantly from the
probability of starting with other illicit

5903
02:39:34,371 --> 02:39:34,850
drugs.

5904
02:39:34,850 --> 02:39:37,340
So it's just that cannabis is there first.

5905
02:39:37,341 --> 02:39:40,970
It's definitely not a gateway drug
in any stretch of the imagination.

5906
02:39:41,210 --> 02:39:41,871
I just,

5907
02:39:41,871 --> 02:39:43,040
I totally disagree.

5908
02:39:43,041 --> 02:39:43,521
And there again,

5909
02:39:43,521 --> 02:39:45,230
there's 50 years of data on this.

5910
02:39:45,530 --> 02:39:47,870
I know the studies that he's quoting,

5911
02:39:47,871 --> 02:39:48,470
but there are,

5912
02:39:48,470 --> 02:39:49,760
there are many others.

5913
02:39:49,880 --> 02:39:52,070
And I think the argument is as to why.

5914
02:39:52,280 --> 02:39:52,641
And again,

5915
02:39:52,641 --> 02:39:57,641
I think the argument that that to some
extent having access to this drug via it

5916
02:39:58,830 --> 02:40:02,150
illegally tends to open you
up to other illegal stuff,

5917
02:40:02,180 --> 02:40:04,310
which to me is an
argument for legalization.

5918
02:40:04,580 --> 02:40:05,110
So,

5919
02:40:05,110 --> 02:40:05,420
but I,

5920
02:40:05,420 --> 02:40:07,040
I do want to throw one thing out there,

5921
02:40:07,460 --> 02:40:08,061
you know,

5922
02:40:08,061 --> 02:40:11,630
I dunno how many of your viewers
have teenage kids or you know,

5923
02:40:11,631 --> 02:40:12,150
it's probably,

5924
02:40:12,150 --> 02:40:14,000
they're probably more
likely be teenage kids and

5925
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:14,880
to have teenage kids.

5926
02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:15,953
But you know,

5927
02:40:16,380 --> 02:40:17,970
the book has,

5928
02:40:20,100 --> 02:40:22,530
the one thing that
really worries me in the,

5929
02:40:22,620 --> 02:40:24,210
if we're talking about gateway drugs,

5930
02:40:24,211 --> 02:40:29,211
is that jewel and vaping
are really a gateway to THC.

5931
02:40:29,311 --> 02:40:30,120
Vaping.

5932
02:40:30,120 --> 02:40:30,721
So you can,

5933
02:40:30,721 --> 02:40:30,931
you know,

5934
02:40:30,931 --> 02:40:32,400
you can run to that because,

5935
02:40:32,401 --> 02:40:32,760
well,

5936
02:40:32,760 --> 02:40:33,151
first of all,

5937
02:40:33,151 --> 02:40:33,721
it gets people,

5938
02:40:33,721 --> 02:40:34,590
it gets kids,

5939
02:40:34,591 --> 02:40:39,591
teenagers used to inhaling this illicit
substance and you can actually retrofit

5940
02:40:40,680 --> 02:40:42,570
a jewel pod with THC.

5941
02:40:42,571 --> 02:40:43,321
They don't sell them,

5942
02:40:43,321 --> 02:40:43,800
but you can,

5943
02:40:43,800 --> 02:40:44,041
you know,

5944
02:40:44,041 --> 02:40:46,440
you can easily go online
and look up how to do it.

5945
02:40:46,800 --> 02:40:51,800
And I think it really worries me and
I've heard from a lot of parents in the

5946
02:40:52,050 --> 02:40:54,810
last month that there is
an epidemic of Nicotine,

5947
02:40:54,811 --> 02:40:59,190
vaping and TAC vaping going
on right now and that I think,

5948
02:40:59,210 --> 02:40:59,370
and,

5949
02:40:59,370 --> 02:41:00,630
and we're talking about 15,

5950
02:41:00,631 --> 02:41:01,081
16,

5951
02:41:01,081 --> 02:41:03,690
17 year olds inhaling pure THC,

5952
02:41:03,691 --> 02:41:05,490
the most dangerous form of this drug.

5953
02:41:05,760 --> 02:41:07,710
And I think unfortunately,

5954
02:41:08,130 --> 02:41:11,550
it's not going to take long before the
mental health consequences of that become

5955
02:41:11,551 --> 02:41:11,990
apparent.

5956
02:41:11,990 --> 02:41:12,710
And,

5957
02:41:12,710 --> 02:41:16,350
and I really do hope that the book gives
parents some tools to talk to their

5958
02:41:16,351 --> 02:41:17,184
kids about that.

5959
02:41:17,190 --> 02:41:17,360
If,

5960
02:41:17,360 --> 02:41:18,510
if nothing else,

5961
02:41:19,830 --> 02:41:20,663
last words.

5962
02:41:21,270 --> 02:41:21,870
Uh,

5963
02:41:21,870 --> 02:41:25,230
I was actually wanting to go over a few
things that maybe I thought you might be

5964
02:41:25,290 --> 02:41:26,070
interested in.

5965
02:41:26,070 --> 02:41:26,430
Okay.

5966
02:41:26,430 --> 02:41:26,761
Okay.

5967
02:41:26,761 --> 02:41:27,420
So,

5968
02:41:27,420 --> 02:41:28,080
um,

5969
02:41:28,080 --> 02:41:28,440
you know,

5970
02:41:28,440 --> 02:41:29,011
you're a dude,

5971
02:41:29,011 --> 02:41:29,970
you're over 50,

5972
02:41:29,971 --> 02:41:31,200
so prostate cancer.

5973
02:41:31,440 --> 02:41:31,950
So,

5974
02:41:31,950 --> 02:41:32,221
uh,

5975
02:41:32,221 --> 02:41:32,401
you know,

5976
02:41:32,401 --> 02:41:36,360
it's been shown that CBD may actually
be beneficial for prostate cancer.

5977
02:41:36,570 --> 02:41:37,980
And one thing within that too,

5978
02:41:37,981 --> 02:41:38,761
in the same study,

5979
02:41:38,761 --> 02:41:43,400
they actually found that people who use
CBD and we're on Chemotherapeutics is

5980
02:41:43,401 --> 02:41:44,790
actually augment it.

5981
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:45,480
Um,

5982
02:41:45,480 --> 02:41:45,781
the,

5983
02:41:45,781 --> 02:41:45,930
uh,

5984
02:41:45,930 --> 02:41:47,120
efficacy of what you said,

5985
02:41:47,130 --> 02:41:48,480
they're good for prostate cancer.

5986
02:41:48,481 --> 02:41:51,010
Do you mean to prevent it or treat it?

5987
02:41:51,030 --> 02:41:51,870
Prevent and treat?

5988
02:41:52,170 --> 02:41:52,820
Yeah,

5989
02:41:52,820 --> 02:41:53,290
yeah.

5990
02:41:53,290 --> 02:41:53,680
Um,

5991
02:41:53,680 --> 02:41:54,421
and then they say,

5992
02:41:54,421 --> 02:41:54,630
you know,

5993
02:41:54,630 --> 02:41:58,620
THC may actually be a little
bit effective because it can,

5994
02:41:58,660 --> 02:42:00,540
and this comes back to
to stuff's a little bit,

5995
02:42:00,720 --> 02:42:02,160
it can antagonize Dha,

5996
02:42:02,190 --> 02:42:02,731
DHT.

5997
02:42:02,731 --> 02:42:05,400
So DHT is another testosterone,

5998
02:42:05,720 --> 02:42:06,010
you know,

5999
02:42:06,010 --> 02:42:06,841
hormone as you know,

6000
02:42:06,841 --> 02:42:07,410
and that's,

6001
02:42:07,410 --> 02:42:07,621
you know,

6002
02:42:07,621 --> 02:42:07,981
more,

6003
02:42:07,981 --> 02:42:08,250
uh,

6004
02:42:08,250 --> 02:42:10,320
more linked to prostate cancer.

6005
02:42:10,650 --> 02:42:11,130
Um,

6006
02:42:11,130 --> 02:42:11,791
one thing too,

6007
02:42:11,791 --> 02:42:11,941
you know,

6008
02:42:11,941 --> 02:42:16,420
we didn't get really get to talk about
was a c t a n n a concussion is the oil.

6009
02:42:16,530 --> 02:42:19,530
I know a lot of your viewers
are in a MMA and all about that.

6010
02:42:19,531 --> 02:42:21,810
And I tweet allowed to study other
day that you retweeted and I really

6011
02:42:21,811 --> 02:42:22,644
appreciate that.

6012
02:42:22,920 --> 02:42:23,310
Um,

6013
02:42:23,310 --> 02:42:23,491
you know,

6014
02:42:23,491 --> 02:42:23,631
and,

6015
02:42:23,631 --> 02:42:24,001
and just,

6016
02:42:24,001 --> 02:42:24,121
you know,

6017
02:42:24,121 --> 02:42:27,520
it was a three year study showed
that the mortality rate overall was,

6018
02:42:27,521 --> 02:42:30,630
it was nine and a half percent
for people who had suffered a Tbi.

6019
02:42:30,960 --> 02:42:31,440
Um,

6020
02:42:31,440 --> 02:42:32,251
people who test it.

6021
02:42:32,251 --> 02:42:34,440
I know we talked about
correlation causation,

6022
02:42:34,441 --> 02:42:34,910
but you know,

6023
02:42:34,910 --> 02:42:39,180
the THC users only had
a 2.4% were tolerated.

6024
02:42:39,360 --> 02:42:39,880
The non,

6025
02:42:39,880 --> 02:42:41,960
she was just had 11.5% were telling me.

6026
02:42:41,980 --> 02:42:43,140
I mean that's really,

6027
02:42:43,141 --> 02:42:44,160
really significant,

6028
02:42:44,161 --> 02:42:44,371
right?

6029
02:42:44,371 --> 02:42:48,330
Like I suppose it's just THC and not CBD
because CBD has been shown to be very

6030
02:42:48,331 --> 02:42:50,760
beneficial for people with
traumatic brain injuries.

6031
02:42:50,820 --> 02:42:51,270
Yup.

6032
02:42:51,270 --> 02:42:51,480
Yup.

6033
02:42:51,480 --> 02:42:52,313
It's actually the,

6034
02:42:52,640 --> 02:42:54,120
the are both beneficial.

6035
02:42:54,150 --> 02:42:54,600
Yes.

6036
02:42:54,600 --> 02:42:55,560
So that was,

6037
02:42:55,590 --> 02:42:55,980
you know,

6038
02:42:55,980 --> 02:42:57,630
again a correlation you can causation,

6039
02:42:57,631 --> 02:43:00,270
but I mean that the statute
so over overwhelming,

6040
02:43:00,271 --> 02:43:01,050
like if it was,

6041
02:43:01,050 --> 02:43:01,321
you know,

6042
02:43:01,321 --> 02:43:03,900
non cheesy was like 3.5%
of what to bring it up,

6043
02:43:03,901 --> 02:43:08,340
but it's 11.5 11.5% compared to 2.4%.

6044
02:43:08,630 --> 02:43:09,060
Um,

6045
02:43:09,060 --> 02:43:09,521
and again,

6046
02:43:09,521 --> 02:43:10,201
CBD,

6047
02:43:10,201 --> 02:43:10,740
yes.

6048
02:43:10,740 --> 02:43:14,320
And even yo mechanisms of action
have even been identified with that.

6049
02:43:14,440 --> 02:43:19,150
It decreases inflammation in
your brain post concussion.

6050
02:43:19,510 --> 02:43:20,343
Um,

6051
02:43:20,530 --> 02:43:20,771
you know,

6052
02:43:20,771 --> 02:43:21,191
one,

6053
02:43:21,191 --> 02:43:21,580
uh,

6054
02:43:21,580 --> 02:43:22,331
last thing too,

6055
02:43:22,331 --> 02:43:22,571
again,

6056
02:43:22,571 --> 02:43:24,340
there's only one study on it,

6057
02:43:24,341 --> 02:43:24,750
so,

6058
02:43:24,750 --> 02:43:25,810
and it was done on rats.

6059
02:43:25,811 --> 02:43:26,411
But you know,

6060
02:43:26,411 --> 02:43:26,791
I'm,

6061
02:43:26,791 --> 02:43:27,940
I'm a kito guy too.

6062
02:43:28,240 --> 02:43:28,690
Um,

6063
02:43:28,690 --> 02:43:30,460
but the study on rats,

6064
02:43:30,461 --> 02:43:30,790
uh,

6065
02:43:30,790 --> 02:43:33,220
interestingly show that if you have,

6066
02:43:33,250 --> 02:43:34,083
um,

6067
02:43:34,180 --> 02:43:36,070
if you do have a high fat diet,

6068
02:43:36,370 --> 02:43:36,760
uh,

6069
02:43:36,760 --> 02:43:40,930
that you can actually decrease sensitivity
at the CB one receptor and they think

6070
02:43:40,931 --> 02:43:45,550
that that's just because
there's an increase in your
endogenous cannabinoids to

6071
02:43:45,580 --> 02:43:47,620
Hg and inanimate when you,

6072
02:43:47,621 --> 02:43:48,280
um,

6073
02:43:48,280 --> 02:43:50,860
w w when you do have a high fat diet,

6074
02:43:51,190 --> 02:43:51,880
um,

6075
02:43:51,880 --> 02:43:52,391
and then,

6076
02:43:52,391 --> 02:43:53,120
uh,

6077
02:43:53,120 --> 02:43:54,400
kind of go,

6078
02:43:54,700 --> 02:43:54,941
okay,

6079
02:43:54,941 --> 02:43:55,640
sure.

6080
02:43:55,640 --> 02:43:56,050
Um,

6081
02:43:56,050 --> 02:43:57,340
and then all of the timers,

6082
02:43:57,341 --> 02:43:57,760
you know,

6083
02:43:57,760 --> 02:43:58,593
uh,

6084
02:43:58,600 --> 02:43:58,961
again,

6085
02:43:58,961 --> 02:44:01,240
I know you're plus a plus 50,

6086
02:44:01,241 --> 02:44:02,021
so you know,

6087
02:44:02,021 --> 02:44:04,830
cheeks see Saint Jo has Alzheimer's.

6088
02:44:07,080 --> 02:44:09,560
I know that he wants to
keep doing this podcast for,

6089
02:44:09,880 --> 02:44:10,713
for forever.

6090
02:44:12,720 --> 02:44:16,840
So THC has been shown to inhibit the
formation of Beta amyloid plaques.

6091
02:44:16,841 --> 02:44:17,480
So that's the,

6092
02:44:17,480 --> 02:44:17,641
you know,

6093
02:44:17,641 --> 02:44:19,840
the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.

6094
02:44:20,050 --> 02:44:20,530
Um,

6095
02:44:20,530 --> 02:44:24,580
and then CBD CBD has also been
shown to be effective for,

6096
02:44:24,780 --> 02:44:25,240
um,

6097
02:44:25,240 --> 02:44:26,660
for Alzheimer's disease as well.

6098
02:44:26,661 --> 02:44:26,920
You know,

6099
02:44:26,920 --> 02:44:29,410
it was a rat study that
was going to get into,

6100
02:44:29,411 --> 02:44:30,760
but it's fairly fairly,

6101
02:44:30,950 --> 02:44:31,960
it's fairly detailed.

6102
02:44:31,961 --> 02:44:32,560
So you know,

6103
02:44:32,560 --> 02:44:34,260
it might be best just to say that it cane,

6104
02:44:34,440 --> 02:44:34,850
you know,

6105
02:44:34,850 --> 02:44:35,410
um,

6106
02:44:35,410 --> 02:44:37,690
help with rescue memory in patients.

6107
02:44:37,870 --> 02:44:42,520
If you do use CBD meaning and that it may
actually reverse and that's been shown

6108
02:44:42,521 --> 02:44:43,330
before to,

6109
02:44:43,330 --> 02:44:44,440
they've done that in mice.

6110
02:44:44,470 --> 02:44:46,120
I got to interrupt you for one second.

6111
02:44:46,121 --> 02:44:46,401
Okay.

6112
02:44:46,401 --> 02:44:48,520
And I think you would agree this data is,

6113
02:44:49,330 --> 02:44:50,163
some of it's,

6114
02:44:50,230 --> 02:44:51,970
some of it sort of epidemiological,

6115
02:44:52,030 --> 02:44:53,380
some of it's preclinical,

6116
02:44:53,500 --> 02:44:54,640
it's very,

6117
02:44:54,670 --> 02:44:55,720
very early.

6118
02:44:55,720 --> 02:44:57,610
None of it really proves my game.

6119
02:44:58,230 --> 02:45:00,790
But let me say I'm a clinician.

6120
02:45:00,820 --> 02:45:01,420
Okay.

6121
02:45:01,420 --> 02:45:03,820
If someone comes to me and
they have a concussion,

6122
02:45:04,030 --> 02:45:05,950
it's very frustrating just to say to them,

6123
02:45:06,220 --> 02:45:06,491
hey,

6124
02:45:06,491 --> 02:45:07,061
physical,

6125
02:45:07,061 --> 02:45:08,020
cognitive rest,

6126
02:45:08,050 --> 02:45:08,680
go home.

6127
02:45:08,680 --> 02:45:08,951
Okay.

6128
02:45:08,951 --> 02:45:11,650
It's really frustrating to say
that to someone and also to,

6129
02:45:11,680 --> 02:45:12,011
you know,

6130
02:45:12,011 --> 02:45:12,600
the uh,

6131
02:45:12,600 --> 02:45:13,750
the high fat diet thing.

6132
02:45:13,751 --> 02:45:14,080
You know,

6133
02:45:14,080 --> 02:45:15,350
Joe and I both fall,

6134
02:45:15,351 --> 02:45:15,590
you know,

6135
02:45:15,590 --> 02:45:15,881
very,

6136
02:45:15,881 --> 02:45:17,650
very similar die.

6137
02:45:17,710 --> 02:45:20,200
So that's something that I
want to share with regards to,

6138
02:45:20,350 --> 02:45:20,621
you know,

6139
02:45:20,621 --> 02:45:20,830
the,

6140
02:45:20,830 --> 02:45:22,000
the Alzheimer's disease,

6141
02:45:22,150 --> 02:45:23,020
we have really,

6142
02:45:23,021 --> 02:45:25,030
really poor medications for that.

6143
02:45:25,210 --> 02:45:27,040
And we have an aging population.

6144
02:45:27,041 --> 02:45:27,874
So again,

6145
02:45:27,970 --> 02:45:28,481
like Alex,

6146
02:45:28,481 --> 02:45:29,890
like you want to look at everything,

6147
02:45:29,891 --> 02:45:30,760
which is what I'm doing.

6148
02:45:30,761 --> 02:45:34,240
Like I'm looking at everything and I'm
trying to make a clinical decision.

6149
02:45:34,450 --> 02:45:36,700
Am I using some things like without,

6150
02:45:36,940 --> 02:45:37,360
you know,

6151
02:45:37,360 --> 02:45:38,860
randomized controlled trials?

6152
02:45:38,861 --> 02:45:39,610
Of course I am.

6153
02:45:39,610 --> 02:45:40,300
But again,

6154
02:45:40,300 --> 02:45:41,830
I'm a clinician so I'm using,

6155
02:45:41,831 --> 02:45:42,250
you know,

6156
02:45:42,250 --> 02:45:43,360
mechanisms of action.

6157
02:45:43,361 --> 02:45:47,590
I'm using what I've see and clinic and
I'm using epidemiological studies and I'm

6158
02:45:47,591 --> 02:45:51,670
also taking into account what other
medicines do I have you base upon all the

6159
02:45:51,671 --> 02:45:53,500
data at this seems to be
an effective treatment.

6160
02:45:53,501 --> 02:45:56,650
And I am absolutely not saying that
you as a clinician shouldn't do that.

6161
02:45:56,680 --> 02:45:59,560
Especially you're in Canada
at t it cannabis is legal.

6162
02:45:59,920 --> 02:46:00,520
You should,

6163
02:46:00,520 --> 02:46:02,200
you should use your best judgment.

6164
02:46:02,350 --> 02:46:06,460
What I'm saying is that when we're
talking about policy decisions around

6165
02:46:06,461 --> 02:46:09,620
cannabis and THC and to a much lesser,

6166
02:46:09,621 --> 02:46:10,454
since CBD,

6167
02:46:10,880 --> 02:46:13,640
the advocacy groups have
seized on this very,

6168
02:46:13,641 --> 02:46:18,380
very preliminary data to to say a lot of
things about cannabis and THC that have

6169
02:46:18,381 --> 02:46:19,460
not been proven.

6170
02:46:19,640 --> 02:46:20,451
And you know,

6171
02:46:20,451 --> 02:46:22,040
a guy I know named Peter Bock,

6172
02:46:22,041 --> 02:46:23,390
who very smart,

6173
02:46:23,410 --> 02:46:24,110
uh,

6174
02:46:24,110 --> 02:46:25,010
he's a pulmonologist,

6175
02:46:25,011 --> 02:46:29,060
is at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New
York and he wrote a piece in the Wall

6176
02:46:29,060 --> 02:46:29,893
Street Journal a few,

6177
02:46:29,910 --> 02:46:33,590
a couple of weeks ago talking about
cannabis is limits as medicine.

6178
02:46:33,860 --> 02:46:36,380
And he said something that
I thought was so well put,

6179
02:46:36,381 --> 02:46:41,381
which is the reason why
people want cannabis to work
for Alzheimer's and cancer

6180
02:46:41,720 --> 02:46:42,381
and a bunch of things.

6181
02:46:42,381 --> 02:46:42,800
Where does,

6182
02:46:42,800 --> 02:46:45,830
where there's really no evidence that
it works is that we don't have good

6183
02:46:45,831 --> 02:46:46,664
treatments.

6184
02:46:46,820 --> 02:46:48,200
We want cures.

6185
02:46:48,290 --> 02:46:49,550
We want help.

6186
02:46:49,790 --> 02:46:50,151
We,

6187
02:46:50,151 --> 02:46:51,020
if we're clinicians,

6188
02:46:51,320 --> 02:46:51,471
I mean,

6189
02:46:51,471 --> 02:46:52,161
I'm not a clinician.

6190
02:46:52,161 --> 02:46:52,910
You're a clinician.

6191
02:46:52,910 --> 02:46:55,610
Want to be able to give people who
come into our offices something.

6192
02:46:55,730 --> 02:46:58,460
But that hope is not a
substitute for science.

6193
02:46:58,461 --> 02:47:00,290
It doesn't mean that it works.

6194
02:47:00,530 --> 02:47:02,510
And even you want,

6195
02:47:02,511 --> 02:47:03,950
you want your patients to have hope,

6196
02:47:04,130 --> 02:47:04,940
okay.

6197
02:47:04,940 --> 02:47:06,470
But that advocates,

6198
02:47:06,471 --> 02:47:08,840
the people who are using this to push,

6199
02:47:09,050 --> 02:47:13,490
especially to push THC and to capitalize
on the public confusion around THC and

6200
02:47:13,491 --> 02:47:14,300
CBD,

6201
02:47:14,300 --> 02:47:16,550
I think that is a real,

6202
02:47:16,790 --> 02:47:18,560
it's a real disservice to people.

6203
02:47:19,440 --> 02:47:20,273
Okay.

6204
02:47:20,310 --> 02:47:21,090
Um,

6205
02:47:21,090 --> 02:47:21,650
listen,

6206
02:47:21,650 --> 02:47:21,811
uh,

6207
02:47:21,811 --> 02:47:22,890
I think we covered everything.

6208
02:47:23,840 --> 02:47:25,200
It's complicated subject.

6209
02:47:25,201 --> 02:47:26,034
It really is.

6210
02:47:26,040 --> 02:47:26,611
And a,

6211
02:47:26,611 --> 02:47:29,730
I think it's really important to
discuss how complicated it is.

6212
02:47:30,060 --> 02:47:30,510
I don't,

6213
02:47:30,510 --> 02:47:31,590
I don't think there's,

6214
02:47:32,200 --> 02:47:32,510
I've,

6215
02:47:32,510 --> 02:47:36,460
I've never heard such a detailed
analysis of all this stuff in,

6216
02:47:36,490 --> 02:47:39,450
in a way where you can get
two opposing people that are,

6217
02:47:39,540 --> 02:47:39,841
you know,

6218
02:47:39,841 --> 02:47:40,830
very civil about it,

6219
02:47:40,831 --> 02:47:43,020
but agree on certain aspects of it.

6220
02:47:43,021 --> 02:47:43,590
I think.

6221
02:47:43,590 --> 02:47:45,300
I think we really
highlighted all those things.

6222
02:47:45,330 --> 02:47:45,541
Joe,

6223
02:47:45,541 --> 02:47:47,070
thank you so much for having a thank you.

6224
02:47:47,071 --> 02:47:47,641
Thank you guys.

6225
02:47:47,641 --> 02:47:48,421
Thank you so much.

6226
02:47:48,421 --> 02:47:49,254
Really appreciate it.

6227
02:47:49,890 --> 02:47:51,570
Give out your social media please.

6228
02:47:51,660 --> 02:47:51,961
Sure.

6229
02:47:51,961 --> 02:47:54,570
So I'm a at Doc Mychart on Twitter.

6230
02:47:54,571 --> 02:47:54,851
I'm at,

6231
02:47:54,851 --> 02:47:57,720
I talked to my car on
Instagram and a back doctor,

6232
02:47:57,721 --> 02:47:58,820
my car on a,

6233
02:47:58,920 --> 02:47:59,551
on Facebook.

6234
02:47:59,551 --> 02:48:00,091
So that's d,

6235
02:48:00,091 --> 02:48:00,481
r m,

6236
02:48:00,481 --> 02:48:00,780
I,K ,

6238
02:48:01,021 --> 02:48:01,261
h,

6239
02:48:01,261 --> 02:48:01,351
a,

6240
02:48:01,351 --> 02:48:01,501
R,

t.

6242
02:48:01,800 --> 02:48:02,670
And Alex,

6243
02:48:02,671 --> 02:48:03,331
your book is,

6244
02:48:03,331 --> 02:48:05,220
tell your children that's available now.

6245
02:48:05,250 --> 02:48:06,240
It's available everywhere.

6246
02:48:06,241 --> 02:48:07,200
It's available now.

6247
02:48:07,260 --> 02:48:08,093
Uh,

6248
02:48:08,100 --> 02:48:08,933
and uh,

6249
02:48:08,940 --> 02:48:09,840
if I had a copy,

6250
02:48:09,930 --> 02:48:10,763
I'd give you a copy.

6251
02:48:12,380 --> 02:48:13,360
