1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,880
I can't be wearing a headset.
No.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,200
Are you going to wear your hat?
You got to be looked.

3
00:00:05,201 --> 00:00:06,360
Looks Weird.
Well,

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,130
it looks weird if it's only one headset.
Are we live?

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,110
We fucking live,
man.

6
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:15,180
What's going on brother?
Chelan look at you.

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,720
Look at me filling out the tanks.
Budweiser.

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,773
Cheers.
We got it.

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,920
We cannot have a podcast with cowboy 
without America.

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,450
America,
America,

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,590
America.
Yeah.

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,040
So not have a good one.
Hmm.

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,650
So tell me about the tanks.
He sent me a picture today,

14
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,583
gail,
didn't I?

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,160
Yeah.
What are you doing?

16
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,950
And go and dive into Catalina.
Holy Shit.

17
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,710
Home with the home of the sharks.
Makos right?

18
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,603
The MAACO.
Yeah.

19
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,473
I was watching a TV show the other day 
where people are fishing for them out 

20
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:46,650
there.
So we got a filled up,

21
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:47,484
a couple of doubles.
My buddy rob from always sunny in 

22
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:52,170
Philadelphia taking me this weekend 
camping.

23
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,570
So they're going to die,
but they all die of singles.

24
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,660
So I like to go deeper longer with 
singles.

25
00:00:57,661 --> 00:00:58,950
Wasn't going to single tank.
Got Aluminum.

26
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:00,530
80 Oh,
single tank.

27
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:01,141
The tank.
Yeah.

28
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:05,910
So me and my girl or dive in doubles,
which everyone says doubled means double

29
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:06,870
trouble,
but whatever.

30
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:07,704
So what does that mean?
Like how deep can you go with the 

31
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:09,731
double?
Oh,

32
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:11,550
you can go as deep until you run out of 
air,

33
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:16,350
but we'll probably go and the 200 range,
two 20 to 200 feet down,

34
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,213
200 feet down and home.
That's one of those weird ones where 

35
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:21,540
when you come up you got to come up 
slow.

36
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,310
Right.
She didn't get the Benz.

37
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,193
Uh,
yeah,

38
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,450
absolutely.
Um,

39
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,360
you get the bends.
Yeah.

40
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,850
Uh,
decompress and you know,

41
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:30,684
um,
the process did to diving in and I've 

42
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,283
been diving series,
he's like a lot of wreck diving and a 

43
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:37,434
lot of like tech,
you should say diving over the last two 

44
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:39,601
years,
man,

45
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:42,690
I ran some guys in Las Vegas,
but he traveled and he,

46
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:44,880
uh,
kind of schooled me on their,

47
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:45,711
on their way of,
of,

48
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:46,410
of diving.

49
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,243
And I love it man.
And the reason I go to Las Vegas and 

50
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,260
they meet all the time that you got,
I die with guys.

51
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:54,870
They died 200,
300 feet every day.

52
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:55,531
Every week,
you know,

53
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:59,220
so getting around the people that die of
it regularly and know their shit,

54
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:00,570
you know,
is it to teach me the way,

55
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:02,010
you know.
So I think,

56
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:03,000
thanks travis,
I appreciate you.

57
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,560
Show me.
They'll show me the light brother.

58
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,570
Now when you come up,
like from,

59
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:09,570
how do you know like when you're going 
down to my algorithm,

60
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,960
it's all in your dive computers and you,
so your plan,

61
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:13,531
plan,
plan,

62
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:14,130
plan,
plan.

63
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,200
Then you recheck and Lindsey,
she,

64
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:17,034
she does the same thing and we check 
each other's work and make sure it's 

65
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:21,870
all,
all our gases are mapped out for how I'm

66
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,733
like,
let's just say we're going to go 150 

67
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:25,440
feet for ma.

68
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,970
There's a cool,
there's a cool ship down there.

69
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:28,890
We want to check out.
We want to be there for 35 minutes,

70
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:31,020
right?
So I put the algorithm and these apps in

71
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:31,854
our computer or we write it all out and 
it'll tell us exactly how long the 

72
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,783
bottom time we can have the stops that 
we with the make and the gases that we 

73
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:39,630
have to switch to decompress amount of 
nitrogen.

74
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:42,000
In our blood.
I make her way to the surface.

75
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,680
What's the science behind it?
Like what?

76
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:46,320
Why does nitrogen getting your blood?
So because Oh,

77
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:49,780
from Earth's surface to the atmosphere 
is,

78
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:50,940
is one atmosphere,
right?

79
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,893
Every 33 feet is another atmosphere.
So every time we go down 33 we add 

80
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:56,940
another atmosphere that much more 
pressure.

81
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,350
So right now you're breathing 21% 
oxygen,

82
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,400
78%

83
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,670
78% little bit of like Argon,
other shit.

84
00:03:04,671 --> 00:03:05,860
And then the natural air,
right?

85
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,630
A lot of nitrogen to,
yeah.

86
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:11,470
So 78% of the area right now is 
nitrogen.

87
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,633
21% of the oxygen.
Most of you don't know that if that 

88
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:15,040
you're just breathing oxygen.
No,

89
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,290
you're on,
you're reading 21% oxygen.

90
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,133
So,
but you off gas it through your tissues 

91
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,100
because there's no pressure on you,
right?

92
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:21,934
So like right now you're taking a breath
and then you breathe out and the 

93
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:24,574
nitrogen just off gasses will,
as soon as we start going under the 

94
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:27,184
water,
the amount of pressure holds that in 

95
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,430
our,
into our system.

96
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:32,050
Like if we can't,
we can't off gas it.

97
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:34,810
So it becomes turned into liquid and 
goes into our blood,

98
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,710
which is what the Benz is with.
The guys would be working and then these

99
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:40,180
come up cause they had,
they didn't know.

100
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,140
No one knew until,
you know.

101
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:41,974
Right.
I mean we didn't know there wasn't a 

102
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:45,640
moon God until all of a sudden we know 
now.

103
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,910
Like I know.
So um,

104
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,433
yeah.
So they would force the lit the liquid 

105
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:59,830
out of and do a back into a gas by 
coming up fast.

106
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,693
So which goes into your joints and cause
the bends and because it makes you her 

107
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:06,190
bend over hurt your back.
Cause that's what they call it,

108
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:07,060
the bank.
So the guys were like,

109
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,170
Oh fuck,
I'm fucked up.

110
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:09,460
Right.
I got yes.

111
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:11,080
That's where the term national can kill 
you,

112
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:11,741
right?
Oh yeah.

113
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:14,530
Well you can encourage them and your 
brain blood clot,

114
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,200
you know,
all kinds of crazy kill you instantly.

115
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,480
Whoa.
So we,

116
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,330
so 150 feet,
all of a sudden,

117
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,283
25 minutes is up.
Now we're going to start our ascent and 

118
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:28,180
our computer says it right at 70 feet.
We got to do a minute.

119
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,890
At 60 feet.
We got two minutes,

120
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:33,040
we're going to switch gases.
Never my switch to 50% oxygen.

121
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,313
Right?
So increase the amount of oxygen to 

122
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:37,180
which decreases the amount of nitrogen 
that we're breathing.

123
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,390
So we're going to speed the offgassing 
process cause we're coming up.

124
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,300
So the pressure's coming off this,
our body's able to off gas it.

125
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,583
Um,
so we just have to do like stages and 

126
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:47,134
it's all through algorithm.
And the navy dive system been through 

127
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:53,020
years of hundreds of millions of dives.
You know,

128
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:56,470
figuring out the timetables of the 
correct amount of time.

129
00:04:56,471 --> 00:05:00,160
You have to be at each dept to off gas,
the amount of nitrogen your body's built

130
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:00,994
up.
And then when you go deeper than that 

131
00:05:01,651 --> 00:05:05,050
and you start adding in a tri mix,
we had helium and helium,

132
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,180
helium.
So yes,

133
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,870
we had helium into the mix.
And uh,

134
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,360
I mean it's so fun,
but the fear of,

135
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,320
you know,
could I die?

136
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:11,921
Yeah.
Hell yeah.

137
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:12,754
That's what I love it.

138
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,040
I'm crazy.
I fucking love it.

139
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,430
And we were talking earlier about 
sharks.

140
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,563
I swim after the sharks,
like I want to get him on the Gopro 

141
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,510
there like swimming away from the 
sharks.

142
00:05:22,511 --> 00:05:25,290
Don't they don't just eat divers.
They don't need to sweat along a fucking

143
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,790
great white come attack you.
They're like scary to you man.

144
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:32,410
You're like a big black breeding.
I'll fucking bubbles and shiny,

145
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:33,244
you know.
So they want nothing to do with you and 

146
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:37,420
I'm always trying to chase him down.
So most of the shark attack,

147
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,940
so like surface right.
Cause they think it's a cscl up top.

148
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,560
Yeah.
And where would you rather,

149
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:42,394
we were just,
we were just watching it before you got 

150
00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:43,954
here.
Some footage of the shark attacks on on 

151
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:48,820
Youtube and where would you rather be?
I'd rather fight the fucking shark under

152
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:50,290
the water.
I'd rather be under,

153
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,400
under instead of on top.

154
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,233
Like if,
is this the video I posted yesterday on 

155
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,070
the sharp gnawing on the case.
This right.

156
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,650
Fuck everything about this.
This is insane.

157
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,750
This great white shark is trying to get 
these people,

158
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,820
he's biting his cage,
trying to get what's inside.

159
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:06,500
What do you do?
You just grab his dorsal fin to go for a

160
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:06,981
ride,
baby,

161
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:10,370
he can't bind you up behind him.
Rides Back Monta Leo,

162
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,730
have you seen a great way to underwater?
I never have.

163
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:14,780
No,
I've never,

164
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:15,680
I haven't been down,
you know,

165
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,880
in the waters where they're at,
you know,

166
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:18,800
Australia and stuff like that.
So no,

167
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:20,210
I never,
I've never seen a great white,

168
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:22,240
I've seen plenty of hammerheads and you 
know,

169
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,960
Maaco and,
but never like a giant great hammerheads

170
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,200
are so bizarre.
It looks like an Avatar creature.

171
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:28,034
They don't even look real.
I poles with a couple of hammerhead 

172
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,514
women,
you know,

173
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,930
like what are them titties doing honey 
get,

174
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,430
that's what a girl with a cup tries to 
go straight d right away.

175
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,740
It can't be done.
And they lay next to her on the bed.

176
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,753
Define Science.
He got an evil knievel canyon between 

177
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:50,930
your two ties.
So I love diving.

178
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,793
You know,
I got,

179
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,860
I got a great dive partner and my,
my girl Lindsay.

180
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:56,960
And um,
that's the biggest thing having,

181
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,853
you know,
having the companionship in trust if 

182
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:00,010
someone with your life,
right?

183
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,270
So,
you know,

184
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,780
carrying all the tanks.
I,

185
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:03,614
she'll be diving and she'll have a pair 
of devils on her back in two tanks in 

186
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:09,140
the region in ours.
We've got four tanks on the water.

187
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,570
I heard 200 fishing is the shit.
I love it.

188
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,060
Yeah,
I'm gonna eat it.

189
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:15,050
I want to just,
I'm just killed.

190
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:15,884
Kill.
But yeah,

191
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,270
so,
yeah,

192
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,880
absolutely.
Because it's like a hunting but fishing.

193
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,250
Yeah,
it's,

194
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,330
yeah,
it fly easier than you think.

195
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:24,164
You know,
they don't know what the fuck's going 

196
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:24,860
on.

197
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,700
No idea what's going on.
They don't know what you are.

198
00:07:26,701 --> 00:07:27,420
You're like,
what the fuck?

199
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:32,420
Oh fucking God knows it attached to a 
rope.

200
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,753
The SATCHEL,
like a fishing line you could down at 

201
00:07:35,681 --> 00:07:37,670
you cause you shoot it.
It depends if you're using a gun or they

202
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:40,380
have like slings that go on your arm,
you can shoot him like a little luck.

203
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,223
Spiderman and not so much.
Just a little like a slingshot type 

204
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:45,980
thing he's put on your wrist and let go 
of it,

205
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,050
you know?
Wow.

206
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,043
But you're the spear guns.
I'll go far and they have like little 

207
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:53,360
reel.
You can reel it in like how far AH,

208
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,290
50 feet.
Yeah.

209
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,520
Haunted me.
Wow.

210
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,150
Yeah,
they slowed down considerably though.

211
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,900
Report the first few feet.
Wow.

212
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:00,734
Right on it.
And you and your depth perception is so 

213
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:03,290
different underwater.
So it's kind of,

214
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,940
you got to aim above them.

215
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,890
It's weird.
Like a bright right?

216
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:08,260
There were fractions.
Yeah.

217
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,730
That's the same when you shooting down 
when they go hunting boat.

218
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:12,350
Yeah.
They both fish in the water.

219
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:15,140
You got to like aim six inches under 
where you think it's going to be.

220
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,570
Exactly.
Those are now when you're,

221
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:18,404
when you're diving,
I like how long have you been doing 

222
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:20,300
this?
First of all?

223
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,550
Well I got certified in high school.
High School.

224
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,833
Damn.
So you've been doing this for a long 

225
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:25,064
time.
It was just like going 30 40 feet 

226
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,760
recreational diving,
you know,

227
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:32,360
go and see some stupid,
I shouldn't say stupid,

228
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:34,090
but like that's like the,
the,

229
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,760
the recreation they do is go see a reef 
but one read,

230
00:08:36,761 --> 00:08:38,470
it looks like every reef.
Right?

231
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,130
I don't know.
So I kind of got over that.

232
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:42,650
I said,
I met with these guys and doing the shit

233
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:43,940
that only 5% of the world do.

234
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,770
You know,
my goal was to go 500 feet.

235
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,300
So I've been,
I've been just shy of 300 and yeah,

236
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:53,000
there's just a lot of planning and crazy
shit that goes involved with me and your

237
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:54,890
dad.
Pretty much anything goes wrong.

238
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,670
But uh,
how long does it take you to get up from

239
00:08:56,671 --> 00:09:01,671
the 300 at from 300 it's about a 50 
minute decaux time back of the surface.

240
00:09:03,171 --> 00:09:04,650
So five zero.
Yeah.

241
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:07,290
So it's about a three hour dive 
completely.

242
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,170
Holy Shit.
Now if something goes wrong,

243
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:12,930
like if you're cord gets cut when you're
down there and just heard,

244
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:14,970
but we'll,
if you bleed in oxygen,

245
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,920
right?
You shut one off and go to your cell.

246
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:17,754
You always carry enough getting,
no one's ever died because you have too 

247
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:19,830
much gas.
Right.

248
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:20,561
So,
okay.

249
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:21,900
And carry it with you.
Right.

250
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:23,940
So a lot of the mixtures we bring with 
us,

251
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:25,560
like my back gas,
I'll just be regular,

252
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:30,000
either try and mix gas or regular air 
and then I'll have a 36% oxygen,

253
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,250
which is to about a hundred feet.

254
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,383
So if anything were to go on my back as 
I can haul ass to a hundred feet and 

255
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,660
then start my depo,
you know?

256
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:39,360
And really there's like protocol and all
kinds of different,

257
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:40,194
plus I'm driving with a buddy,
which would be you and you have all the 

258
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:44,071
gas in new too,
so,

259
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:45,560
and you would be,
you know,

260
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,040
arms length away from me.
Some shit went down.

261
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,590
I could give you my gowns here.
Yeah.

262
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,730
Oh Wow.
Give you regulator and take,

263
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:53,160
you have one that hangs on your neck and
one that you're using.

264
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:55,350
Right.
You'd give me yours and put yours in and

265
00:09:55,351 --> 00:09:56,550
we'd figure it out.
Oh,

266
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:59,430
okay.
Like if I was off screwing off and doing

267
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:01,920
something I shouldn't be,
which I'm fucking 99% doing,

268
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,090
then I got to rely on,
never rely on myself.

269
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,680
Whoa.
No,

270
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,750
we can't talk.
So talk,

271
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,613
you have to say.

272
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,780
So me,
me and Lindsay were in,

273
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:13,614
in,
in Florida dive dive in the Spiegel 

274
00:10:15,601 --> 00:10:16,530
Grove,
which is a giant,

275
00:10:16,531 --> 00:10:18,870
like a shoot ship and,
and,

276
00:10:18,871 --> 00:10:22,230
and uh,
the key west and we kind of ship.

277
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:23,940
Was it,
I don't know if it,

278
00:10:23,941 --> 00:10:26,310
the Spiegel Grove is aircraft carrier or
if that's the vandy,

279
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,300
I can't,
I'm getting confused.

280
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:31,830
But one's like a giant aircraft carrier 
and one's a like a destroyer.

281
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,720
Oh Wow.
500 feet.

282
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:36,080
Yeah.
They're natural reefs.

283
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:37,440
So the,
the government song,

284
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,780
Camino cut a bunch of holes in for 
idiots like me to go solve this song,

285
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:40,614
come on.
Purpose.

286
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,900
So they take all the fluids out of them.
They a sink.

287
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:44,730
I'm going to make them artificial reefs.
Wow.

288
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:45,564
And so they do this because the 
decommission the ship and they don't 

289
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:48,230
know what to do with them.
So,

290
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,740
so this is a good move?
Yes.

291
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,670
Make it,
it just put less,

292
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:55,671
let us fish and wildlife hang out and 
then they make money off guys like me.

293
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:56,101
Like,
Hey,

294
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:59,130
let's go fucking explore this thing.
You have to pay to go there.

295
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,590
No,
you just pay for the gas in there.

296
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,900
But the thriving boat captain that needs
to feed his family,

297
00:11:04,901 --> 00:11:05,734
he charges you 180 bucks.
Take you out to gps and tell you good 

298
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:10,110
luck.
Wow.

299
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,973
So a b and Lindsey are out there.
Well of course I'm seeing cool shit 

300
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:15,990
going down in the engine room.
Fucking do whenever I want.

301
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:16,824
And she gets tangled up and has like a 
freak out episode and then I come back 

302
00:11:22,221 --> 00:11:22,831
to like,
what the fuck?

303
00:11:22,831 --> 00:11:23,730
He like,
like gave her like,

304
00:11:23,731 --> 00:11:24,900
where are You ben?
And she's like,

305
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,390
well the fucker like all mad at me.
It was all caught up in things.

306
00:11:27,391 --> 00:11:29,040
But when we got up,
Whoa,

307
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,560
back up to surface.
I got my ass tore up.

308
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:35,850
I was like,
well you made it,

309
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:38,640
you're good.
All the rags we did get off.

310
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,990
Walk it off.
Shit.

311
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,590
You ever gone like on treasure hunting 
dives?

312
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,483
No,
I,

313
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,140
I mean foe.
So first of all,

314
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:48,000
I need to live near the ocean,
which I don't.

315
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,133
And second,
I need to know someone who has a boat 

316
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,070
and you know that you hear stories like 
all these boat.

317
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,010
Know of all the good

318
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,180
fishing cause where the good fishing is 
usually there's a structure down there,

319
00:11:58,181 --> 00:11:59,200
right?
So that's how you like run it.

320
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:01,310
You find that the old boat captain and 
know like uh,

321
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,970
uh,
a structure that's not on any wells,

322
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,790
the gps,
then maybe you could dive down there and

323
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,210
check it out,
but you need,

324
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:08,620
it was a 250,
300 feet.

325
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:11,500
So you need some guys that you trust 
that fucking go deep with you.

326
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,610
Yeah.
So,

327
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:13,444
but now I have it and I would love to,
that'd be something that would fucking 

328
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:16,930
love to do.
I was watching the show,

329
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:18,730
I don't remember what ocean they were,
uh,

330
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,440
pulling the,
the rec from.

331
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:21,274
But these guys were professional 
treasure hunters and they found some 

332
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:26,210
insane amount of goals,
like some,

333
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,600
some Roman ship that sank.
Could you imagine?

334
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,733
Yeah.
And they were trying to figure out who 

335
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:32,800
gets the gold and who claims it in.
Me Too.

336
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,780
It'd be,
it'd be fucking go time.

337
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,343
But you have to be like really careful 
about like giving out the location and 

338
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,790
other treasure hunters would find it.
Like is a big business in that shit.

339
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:46,643
Well,
so like let's just say me and you go 

340
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:49,300
treasure hunting and the captain takes 
the spot.

341
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,340
We find it.
We jumped down also and we find all this

342
00:12:51,341 --> 00:12:52,440
golden,
this treasure.

343
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,060
We only have enough gas for,
who knows,

344
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,440
20 minutes down there.
So we got to come back up.

345
00:12:57,441 --> 00:12:59,260
We couldn't even bring the fucking gold 
this trip.

346
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:01,060
And we want it to,
right now we're back in the belt.

347
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:02,150
You know,
I know the boat.

348
00:13:02,151 --> 00:13:05,110
CAPP knows who else is with us.
So now we've got to figure out who do we

349
00:13:05,111 --> 00:13:07,200
tell and do we tell us,
spoke at it.

350
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,560
Oh,
you're coming with us for the next,

351
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,653
can we figure this shit out?
Because I'm not gonna let you go to 

352
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,830
whoever you.

353
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,540
Yeah.
So it gets really,

354
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,980
really tricky.
You have to kill the captain.

355
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,730
You would have to,
you'd have throat.

356
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,950
Do you know how to use a gps?
You know,

357
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,220
like marketing drop a pin.
Pin.

358
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:21,851
Yeah,
yeah.

359
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:24,850
You'd have to drop a pin on and you'd 
have to kill that guy and drop him where

360
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:28,900
the pin is or don't kill him.
You got to cut him in.

361
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,300
He's got to get a third something.
Yeah.

362
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,320
Or Yeah.
How much money he gets a third for.

363
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,243
Oh,
you're talking probably millions of 

364
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,830
dollars,
but if you don't give them a third,

365
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:40,050
he's going to fucking a rat and you 
know,

366
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,990
fuck yeah.
Yeah.

367
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,790
You have to give him a third because 
you've got to think,

368
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,100
if he didn't take you there,
you'd never got it.

369
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,620
And it's a shitload of money.
It's free.

370
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,720
And so he says half,
then what do you do?

371
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,770
Fuck you.
Then you kick his ass like you don't let

372
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:55,450
them get half.
You got to be generous.

373
00:13:55,451 --> 00:13:57,340
But if he tries to fuck you on your 
generosity,

374
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,203
that's when you kill them.
How many people have probably been 

375
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:04,950
killed over shipwrecks and pirate shit?
Yeah.

376
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:08,680
That goes back a lot though.
Shitty ass wouldn't boats.

377
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,390
How many of those fucking things must 
have crashed?

378
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,940
Plus those greedy bitches,
they loaded him up with gold.

379
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,370
Try to make it across the ocean.
Yeah.

380
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,233
Plus if I was a pirate I'd be no one 
when you're loading your is up and I'd 

381
00:14:19,231 --> 00:14:22,450
just go fucking take yours over and take
offs and I got all my shit plus all your

382
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:23,200
shit.
Right.

383
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,650
Cause we found another one on the list.
Now I'm tripled up big heavy belt.

384
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,450
Well this documentary that I was 
watching,

385
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,900
this guy who was doing it,
it was a professional treasure hunter.

386
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,733
That's what he does.
And you know he has to get investors 

387
00:14:34,691 --> 00:14:39,370
involved because it costs hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to make millions of

388
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,260
dollars treasure hunting and then you've
got to be able to find them.

389
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:43,760
A lot of them apparently around Florida 
shirt.

390
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,623
Well that's so like key west.
There's so many like rec shifts because 

391
00:14:48,731 --> 00:14:50,430
that was like the port,
you know that was the,

392
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,750
so yeah,
I could only,

393
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,070
I mean I went to it,
they have like a wreck ship museum and I

394
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:57,320
went there and talked to all the guys in
there and they're saying that men,

395
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,750
there's thousands and thousands of boats
that are all,

396
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:03,020
because that's the port where they would
do all the tradies thousands.

397
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,943
Wow.
It's a whole nother fucking world down 

398
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:06,140
there,
man.

399
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,120
It really sent a little mermaid.
It's a whole new world.

400
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,680
But,
uh,

401
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,901
look,
I have kids,

402
00:15:14,901 --> 00:15:15,940
men,
I've heard that fucking toy.

403
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:16,420
Yeah,
we all,

404
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,253
and we were just at the Seattle aquarium
and I was looking at these octopus's 

405
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:20,800
they had this,
uh,

406
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,633
octopus exhibit and they were doing this
thing on octopuses with this lady was 

407
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,080
explaining they have three hearts and 
it's insane.

408
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,330
And the brands around their neck and 
underwater.

409
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:30,220
It's fucking,
yeah.

410
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,093
If you're a scuba diver and you haven't 
in a night dive cause there's a whole 

411
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:35,410
nother world at night.
Uh,

412
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,120
like the,
the what are the [inaudible] for the,

413
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,430
when you move luminescent and that's 
crazy.

414
00:15:40,431 --> 00:15:41,264
Yeah.
You can move on to water and everything 

415
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:43,340
close.
And the octopus,

416
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:45,800
how fast they change colors and move.
When you move under water,

417
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:46,634
you glow.
Yeah.

418
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,090
If you shut all your lights off and you 
just like move your arms and draw,

419
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:51,480
he could write joe.
Oh,

420
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,210
going to spell out in the,
out in the,

421
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,260
so,
cool.

422
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,730
Why is that?
Why can you see it?

423
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,743
What is it?
I think the shrimp phytoplankton I've 

424
00:15:59,281 --> 00:16:01,960
seen as the plankton.
Oh,

425
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,203
that's insane.
I mean that might be a little bit 

426
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,280
digitally fixed,
but uh,

427
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,710
it's fucking cool.
Wow.

428
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,950
What area of the world is this stuff?
But we do it and Co's and Mel,

429
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:16,903
whenever I go down to Mexico,
so I'm sure it's know they have in 

430
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:19,670
Puerto Rico at.
That's right.

431
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:20,960
I've seen it.
Unbelievable.

432
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:21,794
So you go down there,
Shit your lights up and you can just 

433
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:25,260
play in the water and kick up and make,
they just glow.

434
00:16:25,261 --> 00:16:29,370
It's write your name.
That's like space ships is space.

435
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,300
And then you have these crazy octopus is
that can change colors.

436
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:33,980
I don't even know how many different 
colors they can change,

437
00:16:33,981 --> 00:16:36,800
but you just see him fucking crawl on 
all across the ground saying,

438
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:37,370
cool.

439
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,203
Wow.
That is so bizarre to end these 

440
00:16:41,631 --> 00:16:42,464
thousands of ships that they like.
One day they're going to figure out 

441
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:45,794
technology to go and find those things.
They're gonna be able to locate all of 

442
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:48,884
them.
But right now when they're willing so 

443
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,460
there wouldn't,
so the rotting away.

444
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:53,720
So,
I mean there's,

445
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,130
there's not much left of them.
Right.

446
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,280
The metal ships are,
are,

447
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,750
are the only thing that I've,
I've done one wouldn't,

448
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,290
and it was,
it was shit,

449
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,810
it was like all fallen apart.
You know,

450
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,913
they don't find much.
But what's left is like the pottery and 

451
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:07,724
the goals and the coins and things along
those lines to find some certain metal 

452
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:13,670
things.
But like swords,

453
00:17:13,671 --> 00:17:15,860
swords right away.
We're not dimensioned dead bodies.

454
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:21,320
I mean if you're finding a ship that no 
one's ever seen does probably cook right

455
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,243
now,
you'll find some fucking dead body type 

456
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:23,450
shit.

457
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,680
Some haunted shit.
Yeah.

458
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:26,900
Type of about putting your heartbeat 
through the roof,

459
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:27,734
going,
opening the hatch and just seeing a 

460
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,250
skeleton head fall in your lap that 
both,

461
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:35,250
that they found that was adrift and 
there was a dude who had turned into a,

462
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:39,740
essentially he had turned into a mummy.
He had been mummified by the sea air and

463
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:42,770
dried out,
slumped over the table.

464
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,310
Like he had a table in the galley.
He slumped over the table and he's dead.

465
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:48,860
There he is.
That's how they found that dude,

466
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:49,763
because I feel like that's,
that's the same movement anyone's going 

467
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:56,520
to do when you're on your last leg and 
you're in a boat that's fucking sick and

468
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,840
that's,
that's the move we're going to do.

469
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,080
It says mommy found on boat missing 
since 2009 one leg out,

470
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,450
pour one leg out posted.
He's like,

471
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:07,770
I guess this is it.

472
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,030
I wonder if another person would have 
made it.

473
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,380
I wonder if he was a pussy one if he 
gave out.

474
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,040
I mean,
you know,

475
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,890
we've got tired of fishing boats.
Probably the,

476
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:22,200
it's the fresh water that gets Ya.
Yeah.

477
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,980
Like I'm sure you can eat fish.
You know,

478
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,823
it'd be the,
it'd be the water that would get you 

479
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:27,590
out.
So how long,

480
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,820
how long have you changed personally?
No,

481
00:18:29,821 --> 00:18:30,654
I could go a week without water from my 
cuts and one 55 so I know I could do a 

482
00:18:33,631 --> 00:18:34,830
week.
Yeah.

483
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,470
And that'd be after that.
I'm on my,

484
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:38,340
I'm on my death bed.
Yeah,

485
00:18:38,341 --> 00:18:39,360
dude,
let's talk about that.

486
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,620
Don't do that anymore.
Don't do that anymore.

487
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,693
That,
I know you keep talking about like 

488
00:18:43,531 --> 00:18:46,080
fighting Eddie Alvarez cause you already
beat him and now he's the champ.

489
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:48,570
But God damn,
you're looking good at one 70.

490
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,220
Yeah.
So you say,

491
00:18:50,221 --> 00:18:53,470
I didn't look good if 55 I've sensation 
with 55,

492
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,060
nine 10 70 or my last run world beater 
man.

493
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,320
It's not just that you look good,
it's just the way you look.

494
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,550
It's like you,
you,

495
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:03,384
you hit a whole new level.
And I always wonder like is it because 

496
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,700
obviously you keep training,
obviously you keep getting better.

497
00:19:08,701 --> 00:19:10,560
Obviously you work hard,
all those things,

498
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,270
uh,
learning from experience,

499
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,180
all those things are a factor.
But on top of that,

500
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:20,280
there's also the factor of you not 
having a cut that fucking wait man.

501
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,400
So this last fight against rick story 
against Rick Story.

502
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,000
It looked like you were in the fucking 
matrix.

503
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:27,834
That was some Anderson Silva's shit.
I ate five guys three nights that we 

504
00:19:31,441 --> 00:19:32,820
were in Vegas.
Five guys.

505
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:34,020
Burgers,
hamburgers,

506
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,573
bevels.
I'm a food bacon and of those 

507
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,640
[inaudible] and he was on the,
of course,

508
00:19:38,641 --> 00:19:38,790
yeah.

509
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,190
You get the Jalapeno,
get the season,

510
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,990
the season fries.
Of course.

511
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,920
See my all healthy.
My trainers are happier.

512
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,470
Yeah.
I mean I think I had six pounds of cut.

513
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,370
It was an easy no brainer.
Yeah.

514
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,233
But when I saw you before the fight,
before that you were a one 76 when you 

515
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:55,740
were at the comedy store.
Yeah.

516
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,560
That's nothing.
Nothing.

517
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,760
Yeah.
Look how good you look at this way.

518
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,830
I feel good.
That's for damn sure.

519
00:20:01,831 --> 00:20:04,500
But isn't that a factor?
I mean look how fast you are.

520
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,620
Like the [inaudible] fight dude,
you were on fire.

521
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,140
You're on fire at that weight.
Yeah,

522
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,830
I dunno.
What's the thought process one do one 55

523
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:14,790
right?
You can do it.

524
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:19,910
You have shown it's like 60 or 65 or 65 
weeks class that be capital,

525
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,100
but it's just that last five pounds.
His death for me.

526
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,300
Fucking brutal.
You know,

527
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:27,720
from 60 to 55 I just feel like I got 
nothing left man.

528
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,960
I don't know if that carries over.
Like,

529
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,230
like I want to ask,
you see pedis slipped a little tired.

530
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,620
Deneen his last fight.
I don't know if the 45 cut,

531
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,660
if that has something to do with that.
Oh for sure.

532
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,440
If it tastes the of your gas tank a 
little hundred percent,

533
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,160
hundred percent,
it has to.

534
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,000
It has to,
right?

535
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,320
Yeah.
I feel great out there.

536
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,573
That's what I'm fucking love fighting.
And it's like my favorite thing in the 

537
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:47,980
whole world to do a

538
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,233
in the whole world.
Like I wish a motherfucker when I leave 

539
00:20:50,711 --> 00:20:52,440
here,
pulls up in the parking lot and tried to

540
00:20:52,441 --> 00:20:55,030
give me shit like that to me is I,
you know,

541
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,950
and this is the way,
it's the craziest thing to me.

542
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,893
People tell me like I,
I posted version of me flipping people 

543
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:01,190
off,
right?

544
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,090
So they're like,
gobble,

545
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,090
you're a fucking role model.
How dare you.

546
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:04,571
Like,
no,

547
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:05,860
I'm not.
I'm a,

548
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,460
I'm a bar junkie that fights all the 
time and you guys just now on TV and,

549
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:10,690
and you and you think is cool.
So you,

550
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,490
I'm,
I'm your favorite fire and you know,

551
00:21:12,491 --> 00:21:13,324
but had you not be in the UFC,
I'd be the asshole trying to take your 

552
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:17,820
girlfriend if fight you at the bar just 
as you know.

553
00:21:17,821 --> 00:21:22,821
You know,
that's who I would be just so you know.

554
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,960
But you say that but you're a very nice 
guy.

555
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,540
I've seen you out there in public and 
part of it's,

556
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,160
cause you're dealing with people that 
are fans and they come up to you.

557
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:32,370
They're nice.
I'm just saying I love fighting man.

558
00:21:32,371 --> 00:21:35,860
I was like well you love it also because
you're really good at it.

559
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,660
I mean if he kept getting your ass 
kicked he'd be like,

560
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:38,700
man,
I've got to find some other,

561
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,250
like when I was in high school and like 
figuring out who I was,

562
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,150
I got my ass kicked a lot cause I was 
that guy and that guy was,

563
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,420
they didn't ever take much to for me to 
jump,

564
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:50,254
you know,
and I'd strike and then I'd get my 

565
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:53,110
fault.
Can I ask mom by three dudes,

566
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,430
two dudes.
One didn't matter.

567
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:57,430
I would just get beat up.
And that's what got you in mma?

568
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,520
No,
I started off kickboxing.

569
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,330
A buddy,
a buddy of mine just told me,

570
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:02,860
you think your telecom tries kickbox and
shit.

571
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,300
And I went down and fell in love with it
and two weeks to train,

572
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,410
first way to try,
um,

573
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,080
commerce,
city rec center in Commerce city,

574
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,180
Denver.
It's like in the,

575
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:17,710
it was this rec center that offered 
Taekwondo Tuesdays and Thursday nights.

576
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,450
And I'd go in there and we'd spar and 
sparring is all I did.

577
00:22:21,451 --> 00:22:22,284
Like that's what I used to do.
I thought that was getting ready for a 

578
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:26,530
fight would be just be fucking throwing 
down.

579
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,060
Now I don't spar at all.
And uh,

580
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,750
all I do is drill because drilling is 
the most important that you do.

581
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:32,584
Right.
But uh,

582
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,680
it's what we would do a spa.
So you don't spar at all?

583
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:37,390
No.
Really interesting.

584
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,141
No,
I,

585
00:22:38,141 --> 00:22:40,900
and I tell my training partners and 
everyone that tried to,

586
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:41,711
you know,
try to get me so far,

587
00:22:41,711 --> 00:22:43,600
but now they're okay with me just 
drilling.

588
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,950
But I feel like the little guy at the 
Walmart in click and every time you take

589
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:49,390
a hit your head,
he pushes the button.

590
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,253
How many,
how many people go in Walmart for it's 

591
00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:52,120
full?
I don't know.

592
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,530
You know,
I have no idea.

593
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,380
How many more do I got?
I think it was a very good point.

594
00:22:56,381 --> 00:23:00,820
Fucking brawls to me and Leonard Garcia 
have in the training room.

595
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,000
I don't know.
Right.

596
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,340
So like I'll get in there and move 
around with Andre and,

597
00:23:05,341 --> 00:23:06,174
and,
and move around with the all the 

598
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,750
heavyweights,
like light mma,

599
00:23:10,751 --> 00:23:11,530
sparring,
you know,

600
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,750
heavy takedowns and grappling real like 
striking,

601
00:23:13,751 --> 00:23:14,250
you know?
Uh,

602
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,150
but the days of putting the big loads on
the thrown down,

603
00:23:16,151 --> 00:23:16,984
hell no.
I just did it with Joe Sheila and the 

604
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:19,750
other day,
so I can't really say Hell No.

605
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:22,300
But him and I had a good,
good tempo and it wasn't anything crazy.

606
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:23,134
You know,
I've watched videos that you guys 

607
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,450
sparring.
It seemed very controlled,

608
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:27,070
very controlled,
so that if you,

609
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,003
if I'm sparring with someone that's very
controlled and doesn't try and kill me 

610
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,100
and cool,
but man going in with some of those guys

611
00:23:33,101 --> 00:23:34,870
that are trying to make a name at the 
gym,

612
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,150
just want to crank you,
then I got to fuck him up.

613
00:23:37,151 --> 00:23:39,510
You know what I mean?
Now we're fighting and you know,

614
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,690
that's a funny contradiction.
It's like I love to fight.

615
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,920
I don't want to spar.

616
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,350
I love if I don't want to get hit 
anymore.

617
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,810
Is there any way we could do that?
These beer say America.

618
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:51,730
You see America,
as I said,

619
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,020
that's the new thing.
Is this a new thing?

620
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,490
America?
That's interesting.

621
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,090
Yeah.
How do you not buy those if you see,

622
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:03,530
and I don't want to have,
what if a course comes along?

623
00:24:03,531 --> 00:24:04,910
Goes America?
Fuck yeah.

624
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:06,890
We don't even talk about coolers.
We talked about ice cold.

625
00:24:06,891 --> 00:24:08,320
Refreshing.
Budweisers that's what we know.

626
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,163
That's it.
That's all you're talking to your 

627
00:24:09,621 --> 00:24:10,360
sponsor.
Yeah.

628
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,193
It's like on it.
We don't talk about musclepharm 

629
00:24:12,111 --> 00:24:12,891
products.
We were talking about,

630
00:24:12,891 --> 00:24:14,570
we take him on to talk about muscle farm
products.

631
00:24:14,571 --> 00:24:15,404
I don't give a fuck.

632
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,550
I'm the least competitive competitive 
guy ever.

633
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,320
I hear it.
My it,

634
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,700
I'm a supporter.
She,

635
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,000
I love fighting man.
I mean sophie you don't spar.

636
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:27,770
I think that's very wise now when 
you're,

637
00:24:27,771 --> 00:24:31,070
when you're doing drills like explain to
me how you're doing them.

638
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,470
You are,
you setting everything up.

639
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,210
Um,
from a,

640
00:24:35,211 --> 00:24:39,410
a striking standpoint where like you 
work in combinations and then counter.

641
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:40,244
So those combinations and then 
possibilities of all the different 

642
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:44,470
things that could happen somewhere with 
brandon gives me now,

643
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,300
you know,
he's fucking great tactician or man,

644
00:24:46,301 --> 00:24:47,210
big fan of that guy.
Yeah,

645
00:24:47,211 --> 00:24:48,044
he breaks his break.
So I don't ever watch tape and people 

646
00:24:50,241 --> 00:24:51,560
think that's so crazy,
but I don't,

647
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,120
I just don't.
But they do.

648
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,450
So my coaches do,
so he'll come and he'll be like this,

649
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,340
we're working on this because I think 
this is what story is going to do.

650
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,203
You know,
we knew he was gonna come with big over 

651
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,030
hands and the needs of the body,
we're going to be there.

652
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:04,190
So everything we drill is,
you know,

653
00:25:04,191 --> 00:25:06,320
when he does this,
make it reactionary,

654
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:07,154
you know,
and I feel like that's all good and 

655
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:09,974
great,
but the good thing is I know how to 

656
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:14,090
fucking fight like deep down in my soul,
so everything,

657
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,013
all of that doesn't work.
I can just fucking bite down and give 

658
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:17,780
her,
well,

659
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,613
you know,
Jeremy Stephens had a very similar 

660
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,530
sentiment.
He said,

661
00:25:21,531 --> 00:25:22,670
I already know how to fight.
Yeah.

662
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:23,661
Yeah.
He goes,

663
00:25:23,661 --> 00:25:26,690
it's all about just getting prepared,
working on my cardio,

664
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,360
working on my fitness,
working on my drills and my techniques.

665
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,880
Yeah.
And that I'm a thousand.

666
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:32,630
I mean,
I,

667
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,130
I don't ever take days off like today of
course,

668
00:25:34,131 --> 00:25:35,030
taken out and drink a beer with you.

669
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:35,471
But,
uh,

670
00:25:35,471 --> 00:25:38,270
I mean for the most part,
I trained fry five days a week and a lot

671
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:39,800
of people think that all I do is fuck 
off.

672
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:41,990
Like he just drinks beer and parties and
no,

673
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,430
I just don't post pictures of me 
training because I fucking hate that.

674
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,600
I hate,
like I see everyone else's vote.

675
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,880
He's like them in the gym.
Then six posts a day of them were like,

676
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,110
no one gives a fuck.
You Swim,

677
00:25:51,111 --> 00:25:52,720
you strength conditioning,
you spike,

678
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:55,320
whatever.
So I just do cool shit and throw that on

679
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:56,154
the Instagram,
you know.

680
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:59,480
But I train all the time.
It's like my job,

681
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:00,314
you know.
So people are always thinking about 

682
00:26:01,191 --> 00:26:02,190
their fucking off.
But I mean I,

683
00:26:02,191 --> 00:26:03,024
I take this very serious and I train 
hard and there's no way you can be as 

684
00:26:05,751 --> 00:26:08,420
good as you are without having to have a
gym in my back yard.

685
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,100
So some days I'll go play at the lake 
all day,

686
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:11,190
but we come home and then we trained 
him.

687
00:26:11,191 --> 00:26:11,991
My coach is like,
fuck,

688
00:26:11,991 --> 00:26:13,390
now it's 2:00
AM and we had the train.

689
00:26:13,391 --> 00:26:15,950
So I mean it's just,
but I love it.

690
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,110
When did you make the decision to stop 
sparring?

691
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:22,610
Probably four fights ago.
Four fights ago.

692
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,313
After which fight?
After I got my ass whipped by a Alvarez 

693
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,710
or by a heel.
Sandro.

694
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,230
Sonia's.
Yeah.

695
00:26:30,231 --> 00:26:32,480
We didn't part of that camp much at all.
But uh,

696
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,593
yeah,
I don't know.

697
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:39,290
I talked to Aubrey is how and you,
and it's how I got hooked up with on it,

698
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:39,690
man.
I,

699
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:42,740
I started thinking something was fucked 
up with my brain.

700
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,980
So I start brushing

701
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,813
my teeth.
One morning I fall over and I hit the 

702
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:46,614
wall.
Like I literally fell over and like hit 

703
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,210
my shoulder on my wall and I was like,
what the fuck?

704
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,580
And I close on on,
I fell over,

705
00:26:53,581 --> 00:26:55,500
hit the other wall and I was like,
Oh man,

706
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,330
something's wrong.
You know,

707
00:26:57,331 --> 00:27:00,510
like something seriously wrong with my 
brain.

708
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,033
And I started freaking out.
So I go get a cat scan and go get an 

709
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:06,900
MRI.
And A,

710
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,513
I'm convinced that I'm God,
I'm concussed and that I've taken too 

711
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:13,030
many shots and I'm,
I,

712
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,400
it's because it's a w what,
what,

713
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,293
let me back the story of a little bit.
Why I think this is because my buddy 

714
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:19,220
Scott Parker,
he's the enforcer for the,

715
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,540
for the Colorado Avalanche,
just,

716
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,653
he can no longer take,
he has like a problem with his 

717
00:27:22,801 --> 00:27:24,600
brainstem.
He took too many punches.

718
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,610
If he takes talks,
if it takes one more,

719
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:27,361
it's going to kill him.
Right.

720
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:31,680
So I'm like talking to him about this 
and now he's like got it in my mind that

721
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,200
I had the same thing.
Like I'm thinking like I fall over,

722
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:35,310
like literally fall over,
hit the wall.

723
00:27:35,311 --> 00:27:35,851
I'm like,
oh fuck,

724
00:27:35,851 --> 00:27:37,500
something's really fucked up with me.
Anyways,

725
00:27:37,501 --> 00:27:39,790
I go and get all these tests,
go see uh,

726
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,561
uh,
ear,

727
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:44,730
nose and throat doctor and it turns out 
my sign and my septum so deviated that I

728
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:49,731
have like a sinus infection and that it 
can't drain because my is deviated.

729
00:27:50,191 --> 00:27:55,191
So I have like this series infection in 
my left cheek and I had to get this,

730
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,940
I had to get on medication and get it 
cleared up,

731
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,010
but that's why I fuck my equilibrium up.
I was like,

732
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,090
so it was getting in your ear?

733
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:01,363
Yeah,
it like they're all connected by any 

734
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,820
infections somehow through my,
I have no idea.

735
00:28:05,821 --> 00:28:07,520
I know how to put this.
I put this,

736
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,393
I still have to do it every day.
I got to put this thing in my nose and 

737
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:10,454
like bro blows like a buck,
a nasal spray and my nose fixed I to I 

738
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:16,494
got my,
and then I had to stop fighting for a 

739
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:18,360
little while.
Not that long.

740
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,490
Not that long man.
I'm telling you,

741
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,443
it turns out I'm not mentally retarded.
I have a infection that I got cleared 

742
00:28:24,811 --> 00:28:26,960
up.
Butch is what I contacted you and I told

743
00:28:26,961 --> 00:28:31,440
the rebel and at the cmt oils and um,
you know the mct,

744
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,950
sorry,
mct oils and the Alpha brain and started

745
00:28:34,951 --> 00:28:35,784
trying to,
cause this is the point where I thought 

746
00:28:36,601 --> 00:28:38,130
I was fucking freaking out.
Right.

747
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,050
We started taking care of your health 
and supplement.

748
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:42,070
Then I feel fucking great man.
Yeah,

749
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,360
there's a big difference between 
supplementing and nuts and I've never,

750
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,490
I've never taken anything.
I'd just never,

751
00:28:47,491 --> 00:28:49,770
everyone always,
I literally budweiser fruit roll ups,

752
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:50,604
you know.
And I know we talked about it and now I 

753
00:28:52,621 --> 00:28:54,870
fucking take these onnit pack day and 
night,

754
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,530
sometimes two a day.
I feel fucking,

755
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:58,883
you know what?
I feel like a fucking cage gorilla 

756
00:29:00,181 --> 00:29:03,270
that's 15 year old and I don't know if 
it has testosterone or not,

757
00:29:03,271 --> 00:29:04,104
but I feel like I,
like my poor girl just gets ravaged now 

758
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:10,380
go like on Cape beats to me.
I'm sure she's happy.

759
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,900
She's very happy.
So,

760
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,111
uh,
you know,

761
00:29:13,111 --> 00:29:13,950
and I don't,
I don't,

762
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,650
I don't know if it's cause it's equaled 
out my body or,

763
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,031
or what.
But man,

764
00:29:18,031 --> 00:29:20,080
I feel my,
my coverage was great and I'm taking,

765
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,300
pumping on it,
you know,

766
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:21,721
I'm like,
I'm,

767
00:29:21,721 --> 00:29:24,570
see I'm never taking something and I 
feel so fucking good.

768
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,190
And I wrote and I walked out,
I said,

769
00:29:26,191 --> 00:29:27,300
hey man,
you got any Alpha brain here?

770
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:28,290
I could fuck a pop,
you know?

771
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:32,370
And so we have,
so there's out,

772
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:33,683
dammit.
Dammit.

773
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,660
But I have some in my bag.
So yeah,

774
00:29:36,661 --> 00:29:37,450
I,
it's,

775
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,400
it's unbelievable,
man.

776
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:41,410
How,
how good I feel and how you don't till,

777
00:29:41,411 --> 00:29:42,244
you know.
Right,

778
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,270
right.
Yeah.

779
00:29:43,271 --> 00:29:44,320
That's the key,
man.

780
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,703
The key is a lot of people walk around 
and they don't take anything and they 

781
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:50,380
think they don't need anything and 
they're like,

782
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,310
ah,
I'm fine.

783
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,330
Well,
you're fine.

784
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,553
You'll exist,
but there's a big difference between 

785
00:29:56,321 --> 00:29:58,780
having your body optimized and not be an
optimized,

786
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,330
healthy food.
You got to get off the candy son,

787
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,300
Candy Habits,
eat candy anymore.

788
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,660
Ever since I've been taking these pills,
it's like it filled a void.

789
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,190
Literally.
I don't,

790
00:30:09,191 --> 00:30:11,950
I don't crave like the sweets like I 
used to.

791
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,100
Um,
it's,

792
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,200
it's unbelievable,
man.

793
00:30:14,201 --> 00:30:15,550
I,
I can honestly say I've,

794
00:30:15,551 --> 00:30:16,870
I've,
I've ditched the candy.

795
00:30:16,871 --> 00:30:17,280
I'm like,
oh,

796
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,113
I eat a snickers bar every now and then,
but I don't take handfuls of milk duds 

797
00:30:21,101 --> 00:30:24,770
and skittles like I used to every day 
ash.

798
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,680
Right?
Yeah.

799
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,870
And I feel like that's why I eat the 
candy to try and like come back,

800
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:29,440
come back up.

801
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,820
But yeah,
definitely.

802
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:32,740
I'm sure.
Are you taking probiotics now?

803
00:30:32,741 --> 00:30:33,900
You've taken the gut,
gut,

804
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:34,743
gut health,
total gut because your gut health 

805
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,920
determines a lot of times what you 
crave.

806
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,023
And one of the things that people find 
is when they get off sugar and they get 

807
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:46,270
off gluten and they get off like a 
simple carbohydrates,

808
00:30:46,271 --> 00:30:48,610
breads and pastas and stuff makes me 
crave it.

809
00:30:48,611 --> 00:30:49,700
The Pussy.
Is that the,

810
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,190
that's natural.
Au Natural.

811
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:56,220
That's your body's going equaled out.
Okay.

812
00:30:57,501 --> 00:31:00,130
I got same park that makes you want to 
fight and makes you want to fuck.

813
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,670
Gotcha.
It's a part of the whole gorilla DNA,

814
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,571
right?
Yeah.

815
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:05,500
No,
there's,

816
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,543
well are you taking a t plus?
Do you take that optimizes your 

817
00:31:09,821 --> 00:31:11,230
hormones?
That's a big one.

818
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,060
Um,
there's Alpha brain,

819
00:31:13,061 --> 00:31:15,670
which one of the good things about Alpha
brain is mental fatigue.

820
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,713
One of the things that helps you in your
workouts is like a lot of times like 

821
00:31:19,301 --> 00:31:22,750
physical fatigue is one factor,
but mental fatigue is a factor too.

822
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:25,030
Like when you step up,
even if your body's tired,

823
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,013
if your mind feels good,
you could find out that you can force 

824
00:31:28,271 --> 00:31:31,600
your body to go through the motions.
You can force your body to do it because

825
00:31:31,601 --> 00:31:35,230
your mind still feels energetic.
But when my mind feels shitty,

826
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:38,140
like for me,
the hardest workouts by far,

827
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,000
or when I'm hung over I'm like,
yeah,

828
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,490
cause my mind is tired.
It's like,

829
00:31:42,491 --> 00:31:44,350
it's not even like my body can't lift 
the weight.

830
00:31:44,351 --> 00:31:46,650
It's like my body's like,
oh,

831
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,250
but my mind is like,
I can't muster it.

832
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:55,750
So Alpha brain post drinking is 
fantastic.

833
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,613
It's one of the best things for 
hangovers because a lot of things that 

834
00:31:59,381 --> 00:32:01,120
are going on,
you're dehydrated.

835
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:01,954
That's a big factor.
But also like all your electrolytes are 

836
00:32:04,271 --> 00:32:05,104
all fucked up and all your 
neurotransmitter levels are all fucked 

837
00:32:07,931 --> 00:32:08,764
up.
You could Jack those backup with Alpha 

838
00:32:10,271 --> 00:32:11,104
brain and knew mood knew mood's a big 
one too because it brings up your 

839
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:16,960
serotonin levels and that's what I have 
each team that comes into the night pack

840
00:32:16,961 --> 00:32:17,800
for sleeping,
right?

841
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,770
Yeah.
Perfect.

842
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:20,850
And I tell people who are trying to 
steal off thing,

843
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,900
but listen to me,
please don't buy it.

844
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,930
Please don't buy it.
Find out what the ingredients are.

845
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,940
Go buy your own shit.
Go by it.

846
00:32:27,941 --> 00:32:30,700
That the best form you can buy.
That's the most important thing.

847
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:33,310
By the purest best version of it,
you can find.

848
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:35,320
Use all those things.
Use Coleen.

849
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,303
He has all these different ingredients.
You're going to find an Alpha brain and 

850
00:32:38,771 --> 00:32:40,340
all the different ingredients.
You're going to find a new mood.

851
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,413
You're going to have results,
but if you want to get it made for you 

852
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,910
in the best possible form,
that's what we sell.

853
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,710
That's what we're trying to do it on it.
We're just trying to,

854
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,320
every everything that I use,
everything that arbor uses,

855
00:32:51,321 --> 00:32:52,690
everything that all the pro athletes 
use,

856
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,420
guys like you use,
we just find that what's the best shit?

857
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,010
Yeah.
What's the best fee?

858
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:58,883
I mean,
I literally feel the Best I've felt in 

859
00:33:01,251 --> 00:33:04,130
my life and I,
I don't know if it has to do with solely

860
00:33:04,131 --> 00:33:06,650
take it on or just reinventing myself,
man.

861
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,484
You know,
uh,

862
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:13,760
you got to sometimes just fucking step 
back and reset and figure out what works

863
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:14,460
for you.
Right.

864
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,980
Does big,
real big.

865
00:33:15,981 --> 00:33:16,391
And I,
and it,

866
00:33:16,391 --> 00:33:18,110
it,
it took a lady Francesca Parker,

867
00:33:18,111 --> 00:33:21,260
Scott's wife did set me down and fucking
tell me,

868
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:22,483
cowboy,
what,

869
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:24,200
what's the bad in your life?
I've got to get that shit.

870
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,000
We gotta get the energy vampires off 
you.

871
00:33:26,001 --> 00:33:26,900
And we got,
and you got it.

872
00:33:26,901 --> 00:33:29,720
You got to hone in and figure out what 
works for you again,

873
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:30,480
man.
And,

874
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,370
and I did.
And I feel fucking great man.

875
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,750
Was Aubrey taking you into the room in 
his house for the,

876
00:33:34,751 --> 00:33:36,810
the,
the launching into space now.

877
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,690
The psychedelic journey room.
No,

878
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,640
I ain't ready for that.
I'm ready for that.

879
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:41,900
Are you ready for that?
I'm ready for that.

880
00:33:41,901 --> 00:33:43,790
I'm ready for that too.
I need to do it this year.

881
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:47,090
I'm about a year off of,
I've done it.

882
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,710
I was,
I did about a year ago.

883
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,600
I'm a,
I'm feeling like right about now.

884
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:52,550
I'm ready to get back in there.
Let's do it together.

885
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:53,630
Okay,
let's do it.

886
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:54,740
Let's,
let's hook up with Aubrey.

887
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,690
We'll figure out a time you got to go 
meet the,

888
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,800
meet the overlords telling you,
man,

889
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,470
I'm all this shit that you say that.
It's crazy.

890
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:07,550
I believe it's crazy,
but it ain't crazy like dmt is crazy.

891
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:12,020
GMT is some next level.
Let's go do some drugs and hang out.

892
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,340
I'm telling you.
Is this you saw to approved?

893
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,300
Yes.
Perfect.

894
00:34:17,301 --> 00:34:18,200
It is.
All right.

895
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,063
Well,
you can't test for it and it exists in 

896
00:34:21,111 --> 00:34:23,390
your own brain.
It's like tested you for saliva.

897
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,290
All right?
Literally,

898
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:25,940
it's like testing you for blood.
Oh Man.

899
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:27,890
Cowboy test.
Positive for red platelets.

900
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,690
Amen.
We're going to get in there.

901
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,090
I'm totally,
and we're going.

902
00:34:32,091 --> 00:34:35,650
Do you feel like dmt or what is the tea 
that people take?

903
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,493
The the where we get the Sharmane and 
you go and you drink Iowasca that's dmt 

904
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,083
too.
If we just ate a fucking handful of 

905
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:45,890
mushrooms,
we could have the same psychedelic trip.

906
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,460
DMT is mushrooms times a million plus 
aliens.

907
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:50,743
Huh?

908
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,593
That's the way I describe it.
I've done mushrooms and mushrooms are 

909
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,180
awesome.
You gotta take a shit load of mushrooms.

910
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,043
You have an amazing trip.
But there's something about dmt that 

911
00:35:01,881 --> 00:35:04,310
just blows all the other ones out of the
water.

912
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:06,500
It's the most potent of all 
psychedelics.

913
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,330
Most transcendent of all psychedelics.
She,

914
00:35:09,331 --> 00:35:12,200
I feel like you're a,
you're a black belt and psychedelics.

915
00:35:12,201 --> 00:35:12,741
I'm,
I'm,

916
00:35:12,741 --> 00:35:14,930
uh,
my first day white belt.

917
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,250
Doesn't matter man.
You can,

918
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,570
you can,
you could do it.

919
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,210
Everybody can do it.
I'm sure I could do go from a white belt

920
00:35:20,211 --> 00:35:23,360
to a black belt.
Literally your first class you go,

921
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,000
oh shit.
And you come back and by the way,

922
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,220
you never really a black girl even when 
you do it.

923
00:35:28,221 --> 00:35:30,890
I've done it.
I don't know how many times now,

924
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,810
but every time I do it I'm like,
oh fuck.

925
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:34,010
Here I go.
I get nervous.

926
00:35:34,011 --> 00:35:37,770
I'm white knuckling.
Before you take that hand of the pipe,

927
00:35:37,771 --> 00:35:39,510
you go,
okay,

928
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,020
it just takes one.
Here we go.

929
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,700
Three hits,
three heads,

930
00:35:44,701 --> 00:35:46,780
three minutes is what I recommend.
Deep on.

931
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,810
Blow it out.
Go in again.

932
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:55,020
I can't just do one.
You don't want to get to the door.

933
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,000
You don't want to get you to do.
It's like,

934
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:58,290
you know you play Ding Dong,
ditch,

935
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,800
bring someone's doorbell,
runaway.

936
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,693
You can't do that.
You gotta you gotta you gotta open up 

937
00:36:02,071 --> 00:36:03,220
the door and you got to get into the 
house.

938
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:04,960
Yeah,
it's,

939
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,000
it's,
it's amazing.

940
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,780
How does it make you shit yourself?
Until I'm like,

941
00:36:08,781 --> 00:36:09,090
no,
no,

942
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,940
like the tea.
The problem with the t is that your body

943
00:36:11,941 --> 00:36:16,941
rejects your purging the bad.
That's my argument.

944
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:18,571
You like,
no,

945
00:36:18,571 --> 00:36:20,640
you're just throwing up and shitting 
yourself because you had the shit.

946
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,890
You shouldn't have eight to del Taco 
before he fucking took it.

947
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,473
Well,
you definitely are supposed to alter 

948
00:36:25,231 --> 00:36:26,064
your diet.
You definitely suppose to have an 

949
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:28,644
alkaline diet before you.
A sense that you're going to fucking 

950
00:36:30,991 --> 00:36:32,340
blow your backside out because they're 
like,

951
00:36:32,341 --> 00:36:33,960
you need a fast before you come into 
this.

952
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:34,730
Yeah,
that's not,

953
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:37,710
you purge it now.
Bad energy that's you fucking purge out.

954
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:38,770
Just the shit.
Yeah.

955
00:36:38,771 --> 00:36:39,331
Eight.
Well,

956
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:43,500
this is like hippy dippy,
new age way of talking where people go,

957
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,970
oh,
it's the toxins.

958
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:47,700
You're getting rid of the toxins,
the toxins,

959
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,240
like they do that and yoga all the time.
When you're in this position,

960
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:54,580
this position releases toxins.
It,

961
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,510
it clears your body of all the emotions.
No,

962
00:36:57,511 --> 00:36:59,370
you're stretching.
Shut the fuck up.

963
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,900
And with this dot,
this is d.

964
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:02,400
You're not purging,
you sweating.

965
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,250
If you're sweating,
your body's getting rid of some fluid.

966
00:37:05,251 --> 00:37:07,830
There's definitely so a cleansing 
process involved in that.

967
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,350
There's no fucking toxins like,
come on,

968
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:14,040
stop with the toxins.
At least we're on the same page.

969
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,870
It's just do drugs and have fun.
Yes.

970
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,620
Okay.
Well,

971
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:19,170
I WASCO is dmt.
But what it is,

972
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:21,840
it's a,
it's an orally active version of dnt.

973
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,480
I'll give you the quick breakdown.
Your body produces,

974
00:37:24,481 --> 00:37:28,530
your gut produces something called model
aiming oxidase and you,

975
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,310
it,
what it is is it breaks down dmt.

976
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,233
So if you eat like grass,
like there's certain types of grasses 

977
00:37:35,611 --> 00:37:37,440
and lettuce and a bunch of different 
plans,

978
00:37:37,441 --> 00:37:39,540
like thousands of different plants have 
dmt in them,

979
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,493
but you don't trip when you eat him.
The reason why is because your stomach 

980
00:37:42,631 --> 00:37:44,910
produces something called Monell amy and
oxidase.

981
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,070
Well,
these indigenous people in the Amazon,

982
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,740
they figured out how to combine one 
plant,

983
00:37:49,741 --> 00:37:50,574
which has dmt in it,
and then another plant which has an Mao 

984
00:37:53,251 --> 00:37:54,084
inhibitor.
So this Mao inhibitor inhibits your 

985
00:37:56,191 --> 00:38:00,840
body's production of monoamine oxidase.
And so the DMT naturally absorbs in your

986
00:38:00,841 --> 00:38:03,660
body,
but you're eating these fucked up plants

987
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,780
that tastes like shit.
It tastes like a total dick.

988
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:07,643
Right?
And you just,

989
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,110
you're just throwing up and shitting 
yourself.

990
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,343
Um,
it's supposed to be an incredible 

991
00:38:12,271 --> 00:38:13,920
spiritual experience.
I haven't done it.

992
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,490
I've only done the the way stronger 
version of it,

993
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:18,443
which you smoke,
which doesn't give you any throwing up 

994
00:38:20,251 --> 00:38:22,650
any diarrhea and which sounds way 
better.

995
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,210
It's way better.
It's gotta be,

996
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,220
I think the other ones really amazing 
too.

997
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,480
But the thing about the DMT thing,
they called the businessman's trip cause

998
00:38:30,481 --> 00:38:32,520
you're in and out in 15 minutes.
It's perfect,

999
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:36,100
but I amazing.
So you're not

1000
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:36,993
no hung over.
You're good transient drugs ever 

1001
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,240
exhibited or ever observed in the human 
body.

1002
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,690
Your body brings you back to baseline 
really quickly.

1003
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:48,710
So you're high as a fucking car.
You,

1004
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,310
you're in the center of the universe.
You're,

1005
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,153
you're talking to dee geometric patterns
that are made out of love and 

1006
00:38:55,241 --> 00:38:56,074
understanding and know everything about 
everything you've ever done your whole 

1007
00:38:58,031 --> 00:39:02,830
life and recognize your bullshit and 
dissolve your ego right in front of you.

1008
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,660
Show you your life in,
in,

1009
00:39:04,661 --> 00:39:05,494
in,
in like these hieroglyphs and show you 

1010
00:39:07,991 --> 00:39:11,830
these insane images that are made out of
like neon with no borders.

1011
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,960
And then 15 minutes later your cowboy 
again,

1012
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,120
but you're,
you're renewed.

1013
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,150
It's like resetting your whole 
experience.

1014
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:21,040
Man's planet,
man sold me.

1015
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,360
It's going to be your friend.
You explain that?

1016
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:24,970
I wish I could explain my diving that 
good cause I was just like,

1017
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,180
oh you fucking go in and break some 
other gas.

1018
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,930
And I think he did a great job.
It,

1019
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,480
I think you did a great job explaining 
it.

1020
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,300
But I think there's a lot,
a bunch of factors going on.

1021
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:35,134
I think like with your life,
like all the good things that are 

1022
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:37,294
happening is I think first of all,
a decision to go to one 70 is a very 

1023
00:39:40,241 --> 00:39:41,800
good one.
So here I'm uh,

1024
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,350
I'm uh,
I get upset.

1025
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,330
I think the number one problem we have 
in fighting today,

1026
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:48,370
the number one problem is weight 
cutting.

1027
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:49,880
Yeah.
I fucking with you man.

1028
00:39:49,881 --> 00:39:51,460
And I,
the whole time I was at 55,

1029
00:39:51,461 --> 00:39:52,120
I'd always,
and I,

1030
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,680
you know how I like to fight.
So I'd call,

1031
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,140
Hey,
I want 70 pound or fell out.

1032
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,840
I'll take that fight with Joe.
And Daniel would tell me,

1033
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:59,703
well cowboy,
you're 55 of those guys are fucking 

1034
00:40:01,121 --> 00:40:03,490
monsters.
I guess they were wrong,

1035
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:03,910
weren't they?

1036
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,080
So then,
so now me I would have told you to do is

1037
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,880
hug nomis no offense,
but you don't have the fucking,

1038
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,170
the stamp.
They gave me the fight.

1039
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,280
No,
I need to get a stamp.

1040
00:40:12,281 --> 00:40:16,810
So now I'm like 70 and I want to fight a
55 and they say no,

1041
00:40:16,811 --> 00:40:17,644
you're fucking so great.
It's 70 you don't want to go down to 55 

1042
00:40:20,171 --> 00:40:22,090
like God damn.
Well you guys make up your fucking mind.

1043
00:40:22,091 --> 00:40:22,924
What I can do,
you can't listen to those dudes only 

1044
00:40:23,951 --> 00:40:24,910
listen to me.
Okay,

1045
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:27,070
I'll go through you.
I'll be your manager from now on.

1046
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,620
I'm going to handle,
you can contact me,

1047
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,590
I'll contact them.
Have speaking for cowboy Bam.

1048
00:40:32,591 --> 00:40:34,740
Done.
But they may have,

1049
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:38,250
when I walked in I seen you had a 
wheeler album out front.

1050
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,680
Wheeler Walker.
So man,

1051
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:40,523
so I was getting ready in the,
in the locker room was doesn't I put 

1052
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:45,870
kicking ass need pussy and it's Kinda 
tough.

1053
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,940
It starts,
I've jamming and we get there kind of,

1054
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,320
you know,
a little bit earlier.

1055
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:54,130
And so we still had all the,
I think I had six people in my,

1056
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,023
in my uh,
locker room and I have like a big ass 

1057
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,410
speaker,
like a big jukebox.

1058
00:40:59,411 --> 00:41:00,244
Right.
And I just tell you take over like 

1059
00:41:00,851 --> 00:41:02,440
everyone go with Kaji.
Okay good.

1060
00:41:02,441 --> 00:41:03,274
I'll see you anyways.
So I started playing and then when I 

1061
00:41:04,961 --> 00:41:09,961
start warming up that's what I throw on.
And mother fucker people were like whole

1062
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,750
well how about when it goes to sucking 
Dick?

1063
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:15,160
He called man.
Right.

1064
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,543
So yeah I just,
I noticed that when I walked in I was 

1065
00:41:19,901 --> 00:41:21,820
like Oh okay.
Yeah he's a buddy of mine.

1066
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,220
I love that dude.
He's hilarious.

1067
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,310
He's fucking,
if you ever seen the video for that,

1068
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:29,200
that song,
no the video for that song.

1069
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:30,043
It's hilarious cause they did it at like
this like real country western and the 

1070
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,100
people

1071
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,610
in the audience had no idea he was going
to be there and they had no idea what he

1072
00:41:37,611 --> 00:41:38,444
did.
And so they played it for like these 

1073
00:41:39,621 --> 00:41:41,510
regular country music people

1074
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,740
can play.
Cause we was a buddy of mine,

1075
00:41:45,741 --> 00:41:46,310
man.
We could.

1076
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,830
I'm sure we can begin to hear this right
here.

1077
00:41:48,831 --> 00:41:49,664
No,

1078
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:53,030
here's the video.
Let's watch the video.

1079
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:55,270
Put your headphones on.
Do I stop this one?

1080
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,370
Yeah.
Dot Mine.

1081
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,213
You put yours on

1082
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,323
Friday night work because he had did an 
acoustic version of it too is kind of 

1083
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,753
Jammy.
That's why I kicked his ass and kicking 

1084
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:23,030
out the same people on the train.
You were with me.

1085
00:42:24,421 --> 00:42:25,254
They were like an eye out.
He's probably listening to both see and 

1086
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:32,260
kicking it.
We'll see in the morning.

1087
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:38,160
Was He in the night?
Get into a fight.

1088
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,070
Right for you.
It's perfect song and it's perfect.

1089
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:44,940
I loved it.
Yeah.

1090
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,210
It was just quiet in the change room.

1091
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,800
We're be like,
what the fuck?

1092
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,630
It was good man.
That's awesome.

1093
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:53,583
I think to UFC and MMA in general should
make a concerted effort to stop weight 

1094
00:42:57,431 --> 00:42:58,540
cutting.
Just stop it,

1095
00:42:58,541 --> 00:42:59,374
stop it dead.
Say No more and and just eliminate it 

1096
00:43:01,781 --> 00:43:02,614
completely and I think it can be done.
I think it can be done if you have just 

1097
00:43:06,671 --> 00:43:09,610
set up good fights between guys that are
the same size.

1098
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,050
This,
I think this,

1099
00:43:11,051 --> 00:43:14,800
this whole obsession with like 
championship belts on them with you.

1100
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:16,510
It's all great and everything.
But like,

1101
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:17,344
here's the perfect example,
conor and nate diaz biggest fucking 

1102
00:43:19,691 --> 00:43:23,260
fight in the history of the sport.
No belt on the lot.

1103
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,880
That just,
just throwing down,

1104
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:27,130
nobody gave a fuck.
Nobody said where's the gold?

1105
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:28,450
Where's the strap?
Right.

1106
00:43:28,451 --> 00:43:29,284
Where's the leather?
But he feels like EOC is going more 

1107
00:43:31,031 --> 00:43:32,800
towards big fights in his championship 
fights.

1108
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:35,350
I hope that's what they did.
I hope so.

1109
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:38,780
Till they just take the guys that want 
to on a seat.

1110
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,720
Can you announce that fight that fight?
The no,

1111
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:42,790
dammit.
I can't.

1112
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,200
It's not 100% yet,
but it's going to be fucking ruined.

1113
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:50,460
Ruined.
And it's a good,

1114
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:55,480
hopefully today we get the,
we get the double thumbs up.

1115
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,910
I mean I sent last night,
last night we got the half the thumb.

1116
00:43:58,911 --> 00:43:59,744
So you gotta have to have,
you already have them up like a pose 

1117
00:44:01,641 --> 00:44:03,700
down,
a photo or two of you guys together.

1118
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:06,520
Shit.
That's going to be a good fight and that

1119
00:44:06,521 --> 00:44:07,840
could potentially be mad.
So,

1120
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,280
yeah,
I mean that's,

1121
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:10,143
that's what I'm fucking,
I they didn't put me on 200 and they 

1122
00:44:12,761 --> 00:44:14,830
fucked me on that,
but I really wanted to be,

1123
00:44:14,831 --> 00:44:16,660
but I would want to be on the Madison 
Square Garden.

1124
00:44:16,661 --> 00:44:19,510
Man.
The 200 was great because she was better

1125
00:44:19,511 --> 00:44:20,380
I think it was.
Yes,

1126
00:44:20,381 --> 00:44:21,214
it was better to watch.
The 200 was great because it was a 

1127
00:44:23,021 --> 00:44:25,390
celebration.
But two O two was a better car.

1128
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:26,590
Yes,
absolutely.

1129
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:28,990
The Brian as her thing was kind of a 
freak show.

1130
00:44:28,991 --> 00:44:31,680
Like Holy Shit,
brock Lesnar's back and you know,

1131
00:44:31,681 --> 00:44:32,130
uh,

1132
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,560
Amanda Nunez and [inaudible] was a hell 
of a fight.

1133
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,710
Amanda Nunez,
no jokes on me.

1134
00:44:37,711 --> 00:44:39,630
No joke.
And yeah,

1135
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,270
for some next level women out there,
now they're found Tina,

1136
00:44:43,271 --> 00:44:45,720
chef chanko chick,
holy shit.

1137
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,033
And Holly Holm and,
and there's just so many high level 

1138
00:44:50,071 --> 00:44:50,904
chicks now and fucking Yolanda,
you and Jay check is just a straight up 

1139
00:44:53,731 --> 00:44:54,930
assassin.
Yes.

1140
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,840
I trained with her a little bit of 
muscle farm scam visited and it's fun.

1141
00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:59,450
She's a Badass bitch.
Yeah,

1142
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,140
she'll do respect all,
do respect.

1143
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,360
All do respect.
Now I'll do her,

1144
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,610
I can't say fish calls I got before I 
came on here.

1145
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:06,993
Did there should be an advisory sticker 
on this for what words I can and cannot 

1146
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,850
say who said that to apple?
What had,

1147
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:14,693
you know,
some people from the PR team at UFC and 

1148
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,300
my management team.
So,

1149
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:21,480
uh,
I have a tendency to say bad words.

1150
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,950
Hilarious.
It is,

1151
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:23,963
it is and I don't mean it and I get to 
draw in a derogatory or I just how I 

1152
00:45:27,841 --> 00:45:28,631
talk,
you know,

1153
00:45:28,631 --> 00:45:30,480
and well,
you should talk how you talk.

1154
00:45:30,481 --> 00:45:32,630
I'm telling you cowboy,
I gotta be your fucking manage.

1155
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:36,880
It's all these suits in the way of that 
is the fruit of the sponsors,

1156
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,100
man.
The sponsors.

1157
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,880
I need another beer.
A worked up.

1158
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:41,560
It's the sponsors man.
They,

1159
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,900
they can't,
they can't take it.

1160
00:45:42,901 --> 00:45:44,220
They can't,
they need to take it,

1161
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,920
I think to God damn it think you're 
popular for,

1162
00:45:46,921 --> 00:45:49,770
they think you popular for wearing a bow
tie and talking about,

1163
00:45:49,771 --> 00:45:51,030
uh,
being wide open.

1164
00:45:51,031 --> 00:45:51,864
Right.
Hey man,

1165
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:53,820
look at this.
This is,

1166

uh,
the Colorado Springs Fire Department,

1167
00:45:56,371 --> 00:45:57,690
Dad's captain,
the fire department.

1168
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,460
I was just down there.
They sent some shirts for you.

1169
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:00,383
Oh,

1170
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:01,120
Yeah,

1171
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,540

They're like your biggest fucking,

1172
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:03,723

they wanted you to have those brought 

1173
00:46:07,171 --> 00:46:08,550

1174
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:10,480
So station 12.

1181
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:23,923
They say,

1182
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:26,670
how much you've changed their life.
Just talking about diet,

00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,740
And we gotta we gotta get to the point.
We'll fuck the PR team.

1191
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,550
Fuck man.
Are you hiring?

1192
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:45,384
Are you hiring the UFC has gotta be in a
weird position with this show because 

1193
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:52,520
they know we talked like if he wants the
last one,

1194
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:56,100
me and Eddie Bravo.
Edna Bravo was so fucking drunk.

1195
00:46:56,250 --> 00:47:00,210
He barely knew what he was talking about
15 seconds ago and he was going on about

1196
00:47:00,211 --> 00:47:03,450
how he doesn't believe the rovers on 
Mars are real.

1197
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:08,010
He doesn't know why the water sticks to 
the earth because the earth is round.

1198
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:10,350
What does the water just roll off the 
earth?

1199
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,300
How do you know that the Earth is 
spinning?

1200
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:20,540
It just got so bizarre.
So they can't worry about that though,

1201
00:47:20,851 --> 00:47:23,640
man.
Everybody worries about you being you.

1202
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:24,763
You like people like someone who is 
actually themselves because it's so 

1203
00:47:27,991 --> 00:47:28,824
fucking rare today.
And I feel like I've been myself the 

1204
00:47:30,701 --> 00:47:32,250
whole journey and,
and that's I,

1205
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:33,730
to my grandma's credit,
you know,

1206
00:47:33,731 --> 00:47:34,564
she always tells me,
don't fucking paint yourself in a 

1207
00:47:35,591 --> 00:47:36,730
corner.
No matter what you do,

1208
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:39,400
don't pay.
You should be you through and through.

1209
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:40,600
And I always have,
you know,

1210
00:47:40,601 --> 00:47:42,640
and I probably always will be.
So I,

1211
00:47:42,641 --> 00:47:44,830
I told my manager,
I'm probably going to say some fucked up

1212
00:47:44,831 --> 00:47:46,620
shit and you're going to have to put out
the fires.

1213
00:47:46,621 --> 00:47:48,910
It's not fucked up.
It's what you really think.

1214
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:49,773
Right.
You know,

1215
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,510
goddammit.
It's just as nothing wrong with it,

1216
00:47:52,511 --> 00:47:54,310
man.
They got to understand like this is what

1217
00:47:54,311 --> 00:47:55,540
they do.
They market things,

1218
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:58,480
but they somehow in their mind they 
think that,

1219
00:47:58,540 --> 00:47:59,373
oh,
the best way to market things to not 

1220
00:48:00,161 --> 00:48:01,060
piss anybody off.

1221
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:03,730
That's not true.
The best way to market things is to have

1222
00:48:03,731 --> 00:48:08,731
a guy like you who's out there dive in 
300 fucking feet playing with sharks and

1223
00:48:09,581 --> 00:48:10,414
shit,
riding jet skis and doing all kinds of 

1224
00:48:12,941 --> 00:48:13,900
bananas.
Shit,

1225
00:48:13,901 --> 00:48:15,310
you're fucking mad,
man.

1226
00:48:15,311 --> 00:48:16,144
You're a a genuine madman and they want 
to take you and they want to turn you 

1227
00:48:19,961 --> 00:48:24,910
into some fucking cookie cutter like a 
person that they could sell.

1228
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:26,860
It's bullshit.
It is bullshit.

1229
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:30,250
You can't sell that.
I'm with you who are out of that.

1230
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,113
They want you to to be Luke Bryan.
They want you to have genes that are 

1231
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:35,494
already ripped.
They wanted to give you those fucking 

1232
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:38,860
pre ripped jeans.
Look,

1233
00:48:38,861 --> 00:48:41,540
we scuffed up your boots for you.
Fuck you.

1234
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,540
Fuck you.
Fuck you with it.

1235
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:45,010
I'm with Ya.
Fuck them.

1236
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:47,170
Fuck them all hooked to this beer says 
America on it.

1237
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:48,363
Now you're a fan.

1238
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,293
I'm a big fan.
I can get a couple of cases dropped off 

1239
00:48:50,471 --> 00:48:51,820
anytime you want.
You let me know.

1240
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:53,710
Let me,

1242
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,270
it was,
it just fucking gives beer.

1243
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:59,533
Just a jar at flag.
Fill a flag up with a big gigantic sack 

1244
00:49:05,261 --> 00:49:06,280
of beer.
Yeah.

1245
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,620
You talking about loose.
That's what I can't wait.

1246
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:12,320
We'll get you about two or three more in
and you're going to loose money.

1247
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:16,660
Ready to try to spark up a joint and 
we're going to call it good time.

1248
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:18,880
Since I got that fear factor money,
I got loose.

1249
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:21,550
That's your fucking about him.
It makes you lose that.

1250
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,710
You'll see big money to come in.
It's coming.

1251
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:25,420
It's coming.
It's got to come.

1252
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:26,060
Now.
Did,

1253
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,580
did you sign a new contract?
Did you,

1254
00:49:27,581 --> 00:49:29,410
did you happy?
Yeah.

1255
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:31,160
There's a pause there.
I don't like it is,

1256
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,830
I'm happy.
The pause,

1257
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,960
I mean am as happy as I'd liked to be 
na.

1258
00:49:36,961 --> 00:49:38,080
Am I,
am I skipping?

1259
00:49:38,081 --> 00:49:39,130
No,
but let me tell you something,

1260
00:49:39,131 --> 00:49:40,360
man.
I googled.

1261
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:41,223
I had to take a photo today,
put it on my instagram and I googled 

1262
00:49:43,951 --> 00:49:48,640
donald and it went trump.
And then I put in the word see,

1263
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:51,610
and it was instantly serone you're 
famous motherfucker.

1264
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,620
Hell yeah.
We need to get you paid.

1265
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:55,420
I need to be a fucking manager.

1266
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,740
Do on it.
You're going to be on the team.

1267
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,820
I just don't want to get paid for it.
I want to be like,

1268
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:07,150
I'm just the guy who calls,
just call me if shit gets weird.

1269
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,730
Well your answer is going to be the same
as mine.

1270
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,200
Fuck it.
Fuck it.

1271
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:12,413
Shit.
I feel like a guy like you honestly 

1272
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:17,770
should be completely insulated from 
anybody's advice.

1273
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:19,143
I feel like a guy like you,
it should be like your friends and your 

1274
00:50:21,571 --> 00:50:22,404
family and people you love and everybody
else has to shut the fuck up and just 

1275
00:50:26,081 --> 00:50:27,450
let you go.
Oh,

1276
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:27,980
that's

1277
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,000
a,
I feel every day.

1278
00:50:29,001 --> 00:50:31,580
So yeah.
And then I get phone calls saying,

1279
00:50:31,581 --> 00:50:33,610
you can't say that cat.
Well you can't do that cal,

1280
00:50:33,611 --> 00:50:36,080
but you have to do this.
It's wild.

1281
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:36,973
Yeah.
I mean they have to understand like 

1282
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:39,733
people talk a certain way and they 
express themselves a certain way and 

1283
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:44,480
it's,
it's,

1284
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,313
there's an honesty in what you do that 
you're not going to find in that many 

1285
00:50:48,711 --> 00:50:49,544
people.
There's an honesty and expressing 

1286
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:53,020
yourself that is being lost.
If beans,

1287
00:50:53,021 --> 00:50:54,900
squash is the way I'm geared,
I,

1288
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:56,181
I'm with you,
man.

1289
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:57,770
I wish.
I wish things were different.

1290
00:50:57,771 --> 00:50:58,670
I really do.
I wish that,

1291
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:00,740
I wish I,
you don't have to listen.

1292
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:01,430
Oh,
I do.

1293
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:04,370
Fuck that.
I do this.

1294
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:05,223
This company we're drinking right here.
They don't allow me to say certain 

1295
00:51:07,821 --> 00:51:10,070
things.
I'm Tom Wiser America,

1296
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:11,363
Budweiser.
We've got a problem now you write 

1297
00:51:13,641 --> 00:51:15,910
America on you,
your Budweiser,

1298
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,330
but I'm just saying this.

1299
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:17,901
I'm like,
well,

1300
00:51:17,901 --> 00:51:22,010
we're not at all that.
Paul spoke and talk and a pot smoking is

1301
00:51:22,011 --> 00:51:24,590
American.
All this is American beers.

1302
00:51:24,591 --> 00:51:26,420
American.
They go hand in hand.

1303
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,730
It's not one of them's not bad.
One of them is not good.

1304
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:34,360
I tried to explain to people like,
you can't get a bobcat and your backyard

1305
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:37,580
and not think he's going to fucking 
attack you.

1306
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:39,980
Exactly.
That's how I feel with me too.

1307
00:51:39,981 --> 00:51:42,650
Like I'm a wild motherfucker.
Like you can't,

1308
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:43,513
you can't take the leash off me.
You can't put the leash on me and take 

1309
00:51:46,491 --> 00:51:47,324
me kiss handshake babies.
Then let the leash off and let me and 

1310
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:49,701
say,
oh,

1311
00:51:49,701 --> 00:51:51,840
he's going to be all right.
Exactly.

1312
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:52,693
He's not,
they can't turn you into some fucking 

1313
00:51:54,471 --> 00:51:56,810
Sitcom Dad.
Okay,

1314
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:00,020
who were the wife comes home and yells 
at you like,

1315
00:52:00,021 --> 00:52:01,870
well her throwing her took the trash 
out.

1316
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:04,350
Ooh,
look,

1317
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,560
look.
That's what they want to do.

1318
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,900
They want to figure out how to extract 
money out of you.

1319
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,570
So when a guy like you starts talking 
crazy shit,

1320
00:52:11,571 --> 00:52:12,051
they're like,
oh,

1321
00:52:12,051 --> 00:52:16,760
they're gonna protest.
Oh look out the transgender women,

1322
00:52:16,761 --> 00:52:17,594
but new little lesbian slash animal 
rights community that doesn't like you 

1323
00:52:24,111 --> 00:52:26,270
diving.
Yeah.

1324
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:28,000
God,
I don't know what I do if I couldn't sky

1325
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,103
diver.

1326
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,793
You have a,
you have a problem with a serious 

1327
00:52:33,381 --> 00:52:35,480
problem.
You have a problem with your brain where

1328
00:52:35,481 --> 00:52:36,314
you're thrilled.
Meter gets low and you panic and then 

1329
00:52:38,061 --> 00:52:38,894
you've got a juice up bitch back up and 
you gets low and you got to juice to a 

1330
00:52:41,111 --> 00:52:42,830
big,
and that's why you're great fighter.

1331
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,330
And when we're on DMT or are we going 
to,

1332
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,220
am I going to face these demons?
You think?

1333
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,560
Oh for sure.
Okay.

1334
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:50,450
But you'd be fine.
You with Dmt is going to tell you,

1335
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,373
I would imagine.
I don't know what they're going to tell 

1336
00:52:52,191 --> 00:52:55,170
you.
I'm sorry for even suggesting it because

1337
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:56,053
then what?
I go into it next time they're going to 

1338
00:52:57,081 --> 00:52:57,471
go,
oh,

1339
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,720
you know,
no,

1340
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,593
we're going to say today.
I think your life experiences is a 

1341
00:53:06,021 --> 00:53:07,910
wonderful journey.
Here's what I feel.

1342
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:08,870
I believe,
honestly,

1343
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:09,883
I think what you're doing by fighting at
this extremely high level and by 

1344
00:53:14,601 --> 00:53:15,434
entertaining millions of people 
worldwide is you're providing people 

1345
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:21,620
with incredible thrills.
You know how many people sent me and the

1346
00:53:21,621 --> 00:53:25,470
animated Gif of that final combination 
you landed on rick stories.

1347
00:53:25,471 --> 00:53:25,980
Talk about

1348
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,590
that.
Oh good Lord.

1349
00:53:27,591 --> 00:53:30,260
Lets throw that bitch up on the screen.
Well let's,

1350
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,530
let's talk.
So everyone says how great this convoys,

1351
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,130
oh it's beautiful.
Okay,

1352
00:53:35,131 --> 00:53:36,600
here it is.
All crack.

1353
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,360
That's the end of it.
We'll wash it from the beginning.

1354
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:40,650
We,
you know what I love about it,

1355
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:41,610
man,
what I love,

1356
00:53:41,611 --> 00:53:43,020
I love technique.
Look at this.

1357
00:53:43,021 --> 00:53:44,880
This is what I love.
Pop to the body,

1358
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,260
to the head.
Boom.

1359
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,123
You know what I love about it?
Not a single one of those techniques is 

1360
00:53:49,141 --> 00:53:49,974
wound up.
Not a single one of those techniques is 

1361
00:53:51,721 --> 00:53:55,230
full power.
But look how you doing this pop bank,

1362
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,340
crack blind.
So for everyone is listening.

1363
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:01,380
All that is the Jab,
cross,

1364
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:02,460
Hook,
kick.

1365
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:03,600
Yeah,
but it's not,

1366
00:54:03,601 --> 00:54:06,990
because here's the thing about it.
The way you throw in all these things is

1367
00:54:06,991 --> 00:54:09,180
the way everybody should throw every 
punch,

1368
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,920
your,
there's no windup.

1369
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:13,500
Everything is perfect technique.
The execution,

1370
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:14,960
the timing,
the,

1371
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,190
the accuracy.
Look how beautiful this is,

1372
00:54:17,191 --> 00:54:17,851
man.
See,

1373
00:54:17,851 --> 00:54:18,684
this is you.
So I bet it's hard for you to 

1374
00:54:19,561 --> 00:54:20,394
appreciate.
But for me as a person who calls MMA as 

1375
00:54:23,311 --> 00:54:26,250
a person who watches fights do,
when I was calling that fight,

1376
00:54:26,251 --> 00:54:27,240
I was like this.
I was like,

1377
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,193
Oh,
oh,

1378
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:29,520
oh look at this.
Oh,

1379
00:54:29,521 --> 00:54:31,470
this is perfect.
Geno's upset.

1380
00:54:31,471 --> 00:54:36,000
I missed the triangle I am with myself.
Oh my God,

1381
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,830
he's a tough guy.
He's good.

1382
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:40,520
But get good submission defense.
So last time we talked,

1383
00:54:40,521 --> 00:54:42,360
we talk about Calvin [inaudible] 
himself.

1384
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:44,850
Like I'm playing a video game.
I was in the mode for sure.

1385
00:54:44,851 --> 00:54:45,810
Yeah,
for sure.

1386
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:47,670
That's a matrix.
Shit.

1387
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:48,623
I mean this to me is more impressive 
than when Anderson Silva knocked out 

1388
00:54:51,931 --> 00:54:52,764
forrest griffin.
Cause when Anderson Silva knocked out 

1389
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:55,224
forrest Griffin,
what I know about forest was at forest 

1390
00:54:57,331 --> 00:54:58,710
was compromised going into that fight.

1391
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:00,600
He had been knocked out twice in 
training camp.

1392
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,570
He had a real hard time taking shots and
probably shouldn't have been in there in

1393
00:55:03,571 --> 00:55:07,830
the first place.
And so he had a lot of doubts and he was

1394
00:55:07,831 --> 00:55:12,180
having a real hard time.
This is a big powerful rick story.

1395
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:15,540
Who's a nasty motherfucker.
He throws vicious body shots.

1396
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:18,690
He's a hard wrestler.
He's the guy who was the first loss that

1397
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:22,020
Johnny Hendricks got.
People don't know Rick Story.

1398
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:23,003
Rick story's a tough dude.
And for you to tee off on him like this 

1399
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:26,753
in this perfect way.
Not with big wound up fucking heavy 

1400
00:55:30,691 --> 00:55:31,524
shots like he throws with Rick.
Story likes to do is you pressures guys 

1401
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:37,710
and he fucking digs in or I'm wound to 
the body,

1402
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,360
takes you down,
beats you up.

1403
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,313
He's a tough,
tough dude and what you did is you just 

1404
00:55:42,931 --> 00:55:44,310
use perfect technique.

1405
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,020
That angle when you throw that left,
you throw the LE,

1406
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:48,810
you throw the Left,
the Jab,

1407
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:52,340
you throw the right hand to the body and
then you take that Washes Jab.

1408
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:54,510
Well he bought that way.
I like taking it.

1409
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,310
He did.
Boom.

1410
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,910
That was all like you adjusted,
you adjusted perfectly with that left.

1411
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,520
He tried to be nice,
tried to be nice about yourself.

1412
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:04,570
Look at,
it's a beautiful combination.

1413
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,233
That's a matrix shit and I feel like a 
big part of that is you not depleting 

1414
00:56:09,961 --> 00:56:11,100
your body.
Absolutely.

1415
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:13,290
Another big part of his is one 70 
pounders.

1416
00:56:13,291 --> 00:56:14,124
Don't think you can just come take my 
body shots anymore because I don't like 

1417
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:21,020
I let them more biscuit now.
Yeah,

1418
00:56:21,391 --> 00:56:22,380
right.
You don't,

1419
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:24,310
you don't have to gas body Jesus.

1420
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:25,143
What did your body feel like when you 
fought one 55 like when you compare 

1421
00:56:28,181 --> 00:56:29,014
yourself to a normal training session,
like say you're several months in 

1422
00:56:32,801 --> 00:56:33,634
between fights.
I walk around one s I used to walk 

1423
00:56:36,071 --> 00:56:36,904
around and bout one 74 right.
That was like my deep training camp and 

1424
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:45,940
I noticed when I started to cut I'd get 
down to one 6,870

1425
00:56:45,941 --> 00:56:48,610
but I had nothing in the gas tank man.
I would always be like,

1426
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,740
it would all mental at that point,
you know?

1427
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:55,510
And I didn't have like my body felt real
thin and brittle and one 70 I feel good.

1428
00:56:55,511 --> 00:56:56,920
I don't feel the,
I got the,

1429
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:58,780
I got the extra tank,
you know?

1430
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:02,140
I don't feel like it's a big part of it.
Oh my God.

1431
00:57:02,141 --> 00:57:05,770
Is it big part of it man.
Now you spitting into that thing.

1432
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:07,000
What's going on here?
We've got one.

1433
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,310
I'm drinking Copenhagen.
No,

1434
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,010
what is that shit?
Yeah,

1435
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,130
Copenhagen.
What's the deal with that?

1436
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:17,860
Explain that to me.
What does that do for you?

1437
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:20,830
I've never been involved.
I have no experience in this.

1438
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,800
I should get back on once when I was a 
kid cause I read huckleberry Finn.

1439
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,390
Did they give you,
did they give you a head?

1440
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:27,460
It gave you a head high.
Threw up.

1441
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:28,660
Yeah,
I sorry.

1442
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,950
Extra salivating and it felt like shit.
I don't know.

1443
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,360
It was a good,
I like it.

1444
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,920
Let me try some of that.
Give it a go.

1445
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:38,560
What do you do with it?
Just take a little bump.

1446
00:57:38,561 --> 00:57:41,140
Put under your lip bump.
Little Pinch.

1447
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:43,840
Like a cocaine style bump.
Now we've never done that either.

1448
00:57:43,841 --> 00:57:46,900
I'd go less is less than what you has 
plenty for you.

1449
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:48,310
Is that too much?
That's good.

1450
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,390
Okay.
Where do you put it?

1451
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,700
Any way you put any lift you want.
Okay.

1452
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:53,253
Yeah.
It's going to start to burn a little 

1453
00:57:54,011 --> 00:57:55,930
bit.
Get cancer immediately.

1454
00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:00,220
I don't think so.
I mean now you shouldn't,

1455
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,080
that doesn't taste bad.
No,

1456
00:58:02,081 --> 00:58:04,300
it's like wintergreen done in the right 
one.

1457
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:06,100
It's been the right one,
but you do not.

1458
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,400
I repeat.
Do not want to drink juice bit.

1459
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:10,720
That is a fucking day gone bad.
Well,

1460
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:14,440
one of the guys who worked at UFC who 
was a,

1461
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:16,480
uh,
Jimmy's laughing cause of chewing.

1462
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,480
It looks ridiculous.
Why does it look ridiculous?

1463
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:21,640
You're going to get a supervisee high.
It's going to be great.

1464
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,010
One of the guys that was a stunt man for
the UFC or not the UFC fear factor.

1465
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:27,430
Yeah.
Um,

1466
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:28,533
he worked on so many movie sets where 
couldn't spit that he wound up swallow 

1467
00:58:31,771 --> 00:58:34,690
and spit.
So he got used to chewing and swallowing

1468
00:58:34,691 --> 00:58:36,010
it.
I got my,

1469
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,200
I got it spread out all over my lower 
gum.

1470
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:39,183
Yeah.
You gotta use your tongue and a ball up 

1471
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:42,880
together.
There you go.

1472
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,550
Now.
So I'm not addicted to,

1473
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:45,310
to,
to,

1474
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:47,220
I can go to the pot either.
Yeah.

1475
00:58:47,221 --> 00:58:49,690
I can get from dad,
go weeks without the pussy.

1476
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:52,750
Now I don't have an addictive 
personality at all.

1477
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:57,220
I can know literally.
I mean I can,

1478
00:58:57,550 --> 00:59:00,730
I usually just shoot them on the boat 
and out and I don't know,

1479
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,710
whenever I drank,
I chew what I drink.

1480
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:06,050
This is like a cigar times five.
Oh yeah.

1481
00:59:06,051 --> 00:59:08,540
You're going to get buzzing.
Yeah.

1482
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:09,490
Oh,
I get it.

1483
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:11,290
It's just fun.
I don't know.

1484
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,260
It's probably bad.
Probably a terrible role model and move,

1485
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:15,810
which are bad for you.
Oh No,

1486
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:18,610
it says right here the warning.
Great for you.

1487
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,440
Uh,
I don't know.

1488
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:21,963
They put that on the can,
but I feel like all the people who can 

1489
00:59:23,191 --> 00:59:24,650
sit and get cancer from this are 
pussies.

1490
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:25,850
Is that right?
No.

1491
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:31,550
It's another thing.
You're not supposed to say.

1492
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,840
W we'll Copenhagen sponsor you or in the
UFC and left the house.

1493
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:35,621
Shit.
Well,

1494
00:59:35,621 --> 00:59:38,090
the UFC let them,
why wouldn't they?

1495
00:59:38,091 --> 00:59:39,380
I don't see why,
uh,

1496
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:43,100
maybe cause this is tobacco butt,
but what about alcohol?

1497
00:59:43,101 --> 00:59:43,640
Yeah,
I mean,

1498
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,360
talk about kills a lot of people that 
they don't talk about.

1499
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:46,731
Sure.
But,

1500
00:59:46,731 --> 00:59:49,370
but I mean bud light and anheuser busch 
is a giant sponsor,

1501
00:59:49,371 --> 00:59:50,200
UFC,
so,

1502
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,440
yeah.
Yeah,

1503
00:59:51,441 --> 00:59:52,190
I know.
I have them.

1504
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:53,580
See why they wouldn't,
I don't know if the,

1505
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:55,880
you'll voc Copenhagen right in the 
middle of the octagon.

1506
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:58,340
Yeah.
So man,

1507
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:01,670
people already get mad.
I think it's hilarious.

1508
01:00:01,671 --> 01:00:05,720
And people get mad that Nate Diaz was 
smoking a vape pen after his fight.

1509
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:06,953
I'm like,
you just watched him get punched in the 

1510
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,104
fucking head for 25 minutes and you 
think it's bad that he's smoking a vape 

1511
01:00:14,301 --> 01:00:15,134
pen.

1512
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:17,300
You want to hear the problem with it 
though?

1513
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:18,381
What's the problem?
Well,

1514
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:19,214
there's no problem,
but you sought a contest up to 42 hours 

1515
01:00:22,131 --> 01:00:23,000
after we fight.
Right.

1516
01:00:23,001 --> 01:00:25,880
So it might be a bad call on him because
just because,

1517
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:29,390
only that would be the only bad downfall
I think.

1518
01:00:29,391 --> 01:00:30,770
I mean,
he's totally doing it publicly.

1519
01:00:30,771 --> 01:00:32,960
He could probably get tested immediately
right after.

1520
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:34,003
I don't know.
The thing is that the one he was taken 

1521
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:38,390
with cbd oil,
which is not psychoactive,

1522
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:41,600
which I'm a totally,
totally fan of.

1523
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:43,620
That's all I take.
Do you take cbd with Tom?

1524
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,290
I'd put the patches.
I used the rub.

1525
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:46,371
Yeah,
because he said there's no 

1526
01:00:46,371 --> 01:00:48,290
hallucinogenic effects.
You just did the healing,

1527
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:50,080
the medicinal side of the marijuana.
Right.

1528
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:50,811
So,
uh,

1529
01:00:50,811 --> 01:00:51,890
yeah,
whenever I go to Colorado,

1530
01:00:51,891 --> 01:00:52,724
I load up on another cbd oils and I use 
them all the time for my knees and my 

1531
01:00:56,001 --> 01:00:56,470
elbows.

1532
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:58,070
You can use in a bath,
man,

1533
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:00,480
I have some ointment.
You put it in the sauce.

1534
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,540
Yeah,
it's bath,

1535
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:05,840
but it's really a bath salts for real.
What is this?

1536
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:11,810
The size of that joint parties with 
snoop and the biggest joint ever.

1537
01:01:11,811 --> 01:01:14,120
That is not the biggest joint ever.
That is propaganda.

1538
01:01:14,121 --> 01:01:16,550
I've seen the biggest joint ever.
It's far bigger than that.

1539
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:18,410
I'm a big supporter of both of those 
gentlemen,

1540
01:01:18,411 --> 01:01:21,050
but I don't like lying.
That's a pretty big joint.

1541
01:01:21,051 --> 01:01:25,970
That floor me,
that's not the biggest joint over looked

1542
01:01:25,971 --> 01:01:26,804
in this audit box right here.
Now was in there creeping around 

1543
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:28,840
earlier.
Oh look,

1544
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:31,880
we'd how weird.
So now you're smoking.

1545
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:36,140
Chewing I'm drinking is to see what 
happens when you combine the two of them

1546
01:01:36,141 --> 01:01:37,160
together.
The three of them,

1547
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:39,950
the three of them.
I'm a fucking American.

1548
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:42,320
I'm a grown man.
A middle aged.

1549
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:44,270
I have children.
I have a wife.

1550
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,133
I pay taxes.
I got a lot of good pr things on my 

1551
01:01:48,951 --> 01:01:49,880
side.
I'm telling you,

1552
01:01:49,881 --> 01:01:50,870
change lives,
man.

1553
01:01:50,871 --> 01:01:53,690
You wouldn't be the people that listen 
to this.

1554
01:01:53,691 --> 01:01:54,524
I mean,
this might be a terrible episode for 

1555
01:01:57,021 --> 01:01:59,990
people to tell them to model their life 
after,

1556
01:01:59,991 --> 01:02:00,824
but typically you talk about,
you talk about good health and eating 

1557
01:02:04,581 --> 01:02:08,840
correctly and just people that sit 
around and do nothing with their lives.

1558
01:02:08,841 --> 01:02:09,674
You know,
just getting up on a Sunday and going 

1559
01:02:10,821 --> 01:02:11,780
for a hike and getting out there.
You know,

1560
01:02:11,781 --> 01:02:14,780
you talked about these things,
so they enjoy it.

1561
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:17,263
I get messages every day from people 
that lost a hundred pounds right there 

1562
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,073
feeling healthy.

1563
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:21,383
The problem is we're dealing with 
propaganda and you could do one or two 

1564
01:02:23,911 --> 01:02:25,770
things.
You could either just say,

1565
01:02:25,771 --> 01:02:27,610
well,
you know this is this,

1566
01:02:27,611 --> 01:02:29,670
this,
I think I swallowed all that tobacco.

1567
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,313
Yeah,
it's all gone.

1568
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:34,650
Yeah.
I was wondering why I'm so hot.

1569
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:38,910
You got to bag Glonek it's gone.
Yeah.

1570
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:40,500
Swallowed it.
I had a boy.

1571
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:45,650
I don't know what I'm doing right,
too and drank and so,

1572
01:02:46,331 --> 01:02:47,460
all right.
We're fine.

1573
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:51,660
Eating Pussy and kicking ass.
What happens if you swallow it?

1574
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,330
New Rule.
Jb pulls up something immediately.

1575
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:55,403
New lives enforced by the food and Drug 
Administration will prevent cigarettes 

1576
01:02:58,171 --> 01:03:02,430
and smokeless tobacco sponsorships in 
sporting events that smoking tobacco.

1577
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:04,410
I think that's the vape pens or are 
they,

1578
01:03:04,411 --> 01:03:08,640
is that talking about chewing tobacco?
That's chewing tobacco.

1579
01:03:08,641 --> 01:03:10,200
I swallowed it,
but there was a couple of years ago,

1580
01:03:10,201 --> 01:03:13,810
this was like 2010 find it.
No,

1581
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,840
you're fine.
No,

1582
01:03:15,841 --> 01:03:16,620
you're fine.

1583
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:19,500
You're going to be all right.
Serious head rush though.

1584
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:21,570
This is good.
I'm enjoying this.

1585
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:24,000
I might,
I might incorporate this in my diet.

1586
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,550
What did we start selling on it?
Tobacco pills.

1587
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:31,320
They'd be like snaps packets that you 
put in a little packet.

1588
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:32,183
Well,
that's one thing that you do get when 

1589
01:03:32,971 --> 01:03:33,804
you smoke a cigar.
You get this weird kind of different 

1590
01:03:35,371 --> 01:03:38,070
kind of hot,
absolutely weird kind of head rush.

1591
01:03:38,071 --> 01:03:39,330
Silly,
happy.

1592
01:03:39,331 --> 01:03:41,790
Hi.
You know I didn't spit once.

1593
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:47,160
I never said I was falling it.
I love it.

1594
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:50,820
That might be the best way to go.
Fucking,

1595
01:03:50,821 --> 01:03:51,740
hey rose.
The thing,

1596
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:53,003
we're,
we're,

1597
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:56,310
we're here for a hundred years if we're 
lucky.

1598
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:57,840
Lucky.
And along the way,

1599
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:02,430
we're having a deal with decades and 
decades of propaganda,

1600
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:03,323
which are lies.
It's just lives we were dealing with 

1601
01:04:05,221 --> 01:04:10,221
lies by all these different people that 
profited off of demonization,

1602
01:04:10,231 --> 01:04:11,064
of marijuana,
and having people think that there's 

1603
01:04:12,871 --> 01:04:15,840
something bad about consuming these 
psychedelic drugs.

1604
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,150
These things have made me more 
sensitive.

1605
01:04:18,151 --> 01:04:18,984
They may be nicer.
They made me more aware of my impact on 

1606
01:04:22,411 --> 01:04:23,244
the people that are in my life.
More kind and more appreciative of the 

1607
01:04:26,581 --> 01:04:27,414
people that are in my life.
More appreciative and more thankful for 

1608
01:04:30,121 --> 01:04:32,880
all the lucky things that have happened 
to me.

1609
01:04:32,881 --> 01:04:36,840
All the fortune that I've had to meet.
Good dudes like you and Jamie,

1610
01:04:36,841 --> 01:04:38,280
and,
and to be able to do something like this

1611
01:04:38,281 --> 01:04:41,790
podcast when I smoke weed sometimes.
You know what I think?

1612
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:46,560
I think how fortunate I am and I think,
I think how much I love my children.

1613
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:48,270
I think about how much I love my 
friends.

1614
01:04:48,271 --> 01:04:49,104
I call it my Joey Diaz will call me up 
high in the middle of the day at any 

1615
01:04:52,111 --> 01:04:54,180
given moment ago.
I'm just calling to tell you I love your

1616
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:55,470
dog.
I fucking love you.

1617
01:04:55,471 --> 01:04:57,210
I know he's high as fuck right now.

1618
01:04:57,330 --> 01:04:58,430
I'm so high.
I think I'm on.

1619
01:04:58,431 --> 01:05:01,230
I'm on not even on this planet.
I'm calling you from Jupiter,

1620
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:04,830
but it's not.
These are not bad things folks.

1621
01:05:04,831 --> 01:05:06,570
They're not bad things.
You know,

1622
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:09,480
you know when you see nate Dina's 
smoking a little weed,

1623
01:05:09,481 --> 01:05:11,430
he should be able to smoke a fucking 
joint.

1624
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:12,503
It should be at that press conference.
They should have a one of those oxygen 

1625
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:17,920
things with sucks the air out.
A little vent right above him.

1626
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:21,700
Let him smoke a joint.
You just fought for millions of people,

1627
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:24,280
you know.
That's what I think.

1628
01:05:24,281 --> 01:05:25,510
Cowboy,
I'm with you man.

1629
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:26,380
I'm,
I'm totally,

1630
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:28,160
I think this is the part where budweiser
cancers,

1631
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:29,620
they're like,
we're done.

1632
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:30,820
We're done.
We're done with this.

1633
01:05:30,821 --> 01:05:32,950
You're out of here.
Well,

1634
01:05:32,951 --> 01:05:35,560
sponsorships are hard man.
I understand.

1635
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:37,720
I understand it from their perspective.
You know,

1636
01:05:37,721 --> 01:05:40,060
it's hard cause you're kind of 
outsourcing credibility,

1637
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:40,630
right?

1638
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:42,700
This is all a friend of mine,
my friend Jason Harrison,

1639
01:05:42,701 --> 01:05:44,950
he owns this company called [inaudible],
which is a,

1640
01:05:44,951 --> 01:05:46,420
um,
big time,

1641
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,650
um,
uh,

1642
01:05:47,651 --> 01:05:48,484
hunting apparel company.
And they've been in here before because 

1643
01:05:50,441 --> 01:05:51,480
they're fascinating guys.
He's,

1644
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:52,323
oh,
super smart genius dude who makes like 

1645
01:05:54,341 --> 01:05:55,174
the,
the best clothes for a mountaineering 

1646
01:05:57,701 --> 01:06:00,070
and for hunting.
And he does it because it's his passion.

1647
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:02,350
He likes to do.
So this guy like goes to Japan,

1648
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:05,440
finds all the best fabrics,
and we were talking about,

1649
01:06:05,441 --> 01:06:07,200
I don't know if you know about what's 
going on under armour.

1650
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:09,340
Do you see the thing with a dude killed 
a bear with a spear?

1651
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:11,350
Fuck yeah.
Yeah.

1652
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:12,343
See that's how you feel.
And he killed a bear with a spear and a 

1653
01:06:15,341 --> 01:06:17,860
bunch of people got mad and a bunch of 
people protest it,

1654
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,260
which is really ironic because one of 
the things,

1655
01:06:20,261 --> 01:06:21,760
we're going to kill a bear,
any Predator,

1656
01:06:21,761 --> 01:06:22,810
I'm not a Predator,
a hunter,

1657
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:26,320
but if you're going to kill a predator,
fucking get down and dirty with it.

1658
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,240
Well,
he got down and dirty.

1659
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:29,830
So you had to be,
what,

1660
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:32,440
five feet from it with a spear?
I think he was,

1661
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:33,640
well,
he's a huge dude.

1662
01:06:33,641 --> 01:06:36,520
His name's Josh bonior.
I'll just give him a shout out and a,

1663
01:06:36,521 --> 01:06:37,354
this is what happened.
Josh bowmore killed his bear with a 

1664
01:06:39,041 --> 01:06:41,650
spear and they put the video online like
did he,

1665
01:06:41,651 --> 01:06:43,370
did he treat it first or no,
no,

1666
01:06:43,371 --> 01:06:43,631
no,
no.

1667
01:06:43,631 --> 01:06:44,464
It was at a bait site in Alberta.
He was there the week before I was 

1668
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:47,930
there.
I was their hunting the week afterward.

1669
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:48,950
Okay.
Um,

1670
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:51,650
and he got within 16 feet of this bear 
and fuck,

1671
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:52,503
maybe 16 yards.
He got closest fucked to this bear and 

1672
01:06:55,061 --> 01:06:55,894
he,
but he is like a competitive javelin 

1673
01:06:57,311 --> 01:06:58,540
thrower.
He's a huge dude.

1674
01:06:58,541 --> 01:06:59,650
He's a bodybuilder.
Sure.

1675
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,440
He chucks,
his spear hits the bear,

1676
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:04,570
the bear run 60 yards and dies.
Okay.

1677
01:07:04,571 --> 01:07:06,850
But there's a video of it and the bears 
guts are hanging out.

1678
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:09,250
You know,
it's like hunting scenes or graphic,

1679
01:07:09,251 --> 01:07:10,150
just like,
you know,

1680
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:11,013
everybody likes to have those five guys 
burgers but nobody wants to go to the 

1681
01:07:13,151 --> 01:07:13,984
fucking slaughterhouse and watch them 
get hit in the head with a piston then 

1682
01:07:15,791 --> 01:07:16,624
gutted and hung by their ankles and 
twitching and spraying all over the 

1683
01:07:19,511 --> 01:07:20,344
place.
But that's the reality of the world we 

1684
01:07:21,611 --> 01:07:22,220
live in in,
right?

1685
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:24,430
Sure.
I'm not 100% you know,

1686
01:07:24,431 --> 01:07:25,264
saying that the v I don't think putting 
the video up is a good idea because if 

1687
01:07:29,141 --> 01:07:30,390
you're going to put a video like that 
up,

1688
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:32,023
there's a lot you got explain for hours.
Your position on a whole lot of things 

1689
01:07:35,861 --> 01:07:37,360
for anybody is going to accept that 
video.

1690
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:39,400
Anyway,
under armor,

1691
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:41,830
which was a sponsor,
they sponsored his wife,

1692
01:07:42,310 --> 01:07:43,143
they canceled her sponsorship cause she 
was filming the hunt and then they're 

1693
01:07:46,091 --> 01:07:50,050
getting this huge backlash from all of 
these hunters who were like,

1694
01:07:50,051 --> 01:07:53,140
well this is a legal hunt because it was
legal to do that in Alberta.

1695
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:56,020
And everybody always says like if they 
talk about hunters,

1696
01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:56,681
Oh,
you pussy,

1697
01:07:56,681 --> 01:07:59,560
you think you're fucking man,
go kill him with the spirit or knife.

1698
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:00,483
This guy did it.
Fucking killed a seven foot bear with a 

1699
01:08:03,131 --> 01:08:05,140
spear.
I wouldn't do it.

1700
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,153
I'm not saying there's a couple of 
problems with it as far as like a 

1701
01:08:08,801 --> 01:08:10,330
regular person,
like first of all,

1702
01:08:10,331 --> 01:08:11,164
you gotta be strong as fuck to throw a 
spear hard enough to kill a bear or if 

1703
01:08:14,411 --> 01:08:16,520
you're not you to be close enough.
Yeah.

1704
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:19,910
A couple of those things are those,
those are both huge factors.

1705
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:22,610
You're taking a tremendous risk doing 
something like that,

1706
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:27,590
so it gets out of the realm in a lot of 
people's eyes of like hunting for meat,

1707
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:29,630
which is really the only thing that 
people respect.

1708
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:33,320
If the average person doesn't hunt,
they do not respect trophy animals.

1709
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,240
The trophy hunting,
rather if you say,

1710
01:08:35,241 --> 01:08:36,210
oh,
I want a,

1711
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:38,420
I want a zebra rug,
so I'm going to shoot a zebra.

1712
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:39,403
People who get fucking pissed at u of o 
is wanting to see a stuffed giraffe in 

1713
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:43,284
my backyard.
People will get fucking really mad at 

1714
01:08:45,171 --> 01:08:47,510
you if you kill an animal for its skin.
Sure.

1715
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:48,523
If you kill an animal for the sole 
purpose of eating it and you'd do it in 

1716
01:08:50,871 --> 01:08:53,520
an ethical way,
people they,

1717
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:54,201
they go,
okay,

1718
01:08:54,201 --> 01:08:55,034
I get it because I eat meat myself and I
buy fish from the store and there's 95% 

1719
01:08:58,761 --> 01:09:02,210
of the planet does that.
But this guy who got it,

1720
01:09:02,211 --> 01:09:03,044
there's a huge controversy with armour 
and one of the things that Jason 

1721
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:06,860
Harrison from quill,
you said,

1722
01:09:06,861 --> 01:09:09,200
he goes,
we don't outsource our credibility.

1723
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:10,593
Our company is dependent upon us.
We don't have any athletes that we 

1724
01:09:14,181 --> 01:09:14,780
sponsor.

1725
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:16,790
There's nothing,
there's no one out there that represents

1726
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:19,250
our brand that we have to make sure you 
don't say this.

1727
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:22,040
Don't say that.
All they do is just make great shit.

1728
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:24,830
And I think that's the thing about a 
company like Budweiser.

1729
01:09:24,831 --> 01:09:28,130
I love that a company like budweiser 
gets behind a guy like you,

1730
01:09:28,490 --> 01:09:31,700
but they can't.
They got to accept you for you.

1731
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,090
God accept you for you dirty words and 
all the words and not,

1732
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:37,820
you know.
I said,

1733
01:09:37,821 --> 01:09:42,821
we all know you're a meat eater.
What would your last meal,

1734
01:09:43,071 --> 01:09:47,240
your death row meal,
the choice B l can Jalapenos.

1735
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:50,870
That's how I do so many fucking pissed.
I missed out on that too.

1736
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:53,360
He tells me the next time you hear I 
have you over the house.

1737
01:09:53,361 --> 01:09:55,490
I'll cook for you.
I seen you cooking it last night.

1738
01:09:56,570 --> 01:09:58,010
I know you're only here for short time.

1739
01:09:58,130 --> 01:09:59,840
Next time my friend was planned.
Is that,

1740
01:09:59,841 --> 01:10:01,280
let's train.
Let's get together.

1741
01:10:01,281 --> 01:10:03,980
Let's get a little workout in.
Grill for you.

1742
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:08,120
We'll I'll bring it on.
Yeah,

1743
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:08,960
we could roll.
Yeah,

1744
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,420
we do whatever you want.
I want to,

1745
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:13,000
I want to see how you set up some of 
your shit too.

1746
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:15,170
I want to watch because you know what I 
really love that you do,

1747
01:10:15,171 --> 01:10:16,004
man,
that need of the body that checked me 

1748
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:18,920
the body.
God Damn.

1749
01:10:18,930 --> 01:10:20,600
You'd do that better than anybody in 
this sport.

1750
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:22,600
You and you do it out of nowhere.
You,

1751
01:10:22,601 --> 01:10:26,480
you have a a beautiful way of delivering
that when you don't know it's common.

1752
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:29,840
I think that's a really,
I mean there's a lot of guys that do it,

1753
01:10:29,841 --> 01:10:30,674
don't get me wrong,
but I think that you probably do it as 

1754
01:10:33,021 --> 01:10:35,000
better as good as anybody in mma right 
now.

1755
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:36,463
I like to see how you set that up.
I like to talk to you about that shit 

1756
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:39,790
anytime.
Yeah.

1757
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:42,980
I just got my black belt and pretty 
excited about that Jujitsu,

1758
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:44,713
longtime km,
long time companies being overtrain 15 

1759
01:10:47,541 --> 01:10:50,660
year just putting on the gay.
I don't get into it that much.

1760
01:10:50,661 --> 01:10:54,050
So problematic.
The geese problematic.

1761
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:55,490
Totally caught me off,
gotten into,

1762
01:10:55,530 --> 01:10:57,350
had no idea it was coming to and I was 
like,

1763
01:10:57,351 --> 01:10:58,160
Oh wow,
cool.

1764
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,270
Look,
it's so hung up on that.

1765
01:10:59,271 --> 01:11:00,030
Goddamn.
Gee,

1766
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:01,730
I'm a big fan of the Geek.
I don't.

1767
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:02,593
I have a black belt in the G.
I don't think there's anything wrong 

1768
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:04,874
with the gay,
but I think people are too fucking 

1769
01:11:07,011 --> 01:11:10,190
connected to an article of clothing and 
they're doing it for one reason.

1770
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:15,420
One reason does the only reason into 
that tradition because the guys with the

1771
01:11:15,421 --> 01:11:19,020
Geeky know how to use that fucking Geek 
guy you to hold those collars.

1772
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:20,580
They don't know how to grab those 
sleeves.

1773
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:24,090
They not a control your ass in a way 
they cannot do when you're slippery.

1774
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:25,013
So if you guys go in there mma style and
you're wearing shorts and he's wearing 

1775
01:11:28,051 --> 01:11:28,884
shorts,
it is a completely different ballgame 

1776
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:33,430
and no one wants to admit that I do.
Every time I go wrong.

1777
01:11:33,431 --> 01:11:33,841
And again,
I said,

1778
01:11:33,841 --> 01:11:35,880
hey man,
if you want to take a college,

1779
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:37,620
oh go ahead.
You can have it.

1780
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:38,543
I don't even know how to defend himself.
That's if you want to win by that to go 

1781
01:11:40,471 --> 01:11:41,840
ahead and you can,
you can go ahead and seek,

1782
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:42,683
you'll the shit.
Okay.

1783
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,130
However you want to do.
Listen,

1784
01:11:44,131 --> 01:11:46,110
it's great if you get in a fight with a 
dude with a winter coat,

1785
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:49,650
you know like Jimmy Pedro was probably 
the last guy in the world.

1786
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:51,000
You didn't want to get in a fight with.

1787
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,300
If you have a winter coat,
you know,

1788
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,260
Olympic gold medalist,
judo dude's going to fucking drop you on

1789
01:11:55,261 --> 01:11:56,580
your head.
That's the word.

1790
01:11:56,610 --> 01:11:57,443
But so funny story,
you're talking about Olympic gold medal 

1791
01:11:59,341 --> 01:12:01,860
judo.
My best friend Eric Boni camp and I,

1792
01:12:01,861 --> 01:12:02,694
this is before I start a fight and got 
into a street fight down in Colorado 

1793
01:12:04,651 --> 01:12:05,484
Springs,
Jesus and the guy had his judo jacket 

1794
01:12:08,341 --> 01:12:08,761
on,
right?

1795
01:12:08,761 --> 01:12:10,200
And we were like,
yeah,

1796
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:12,630
whatever.
Fucking we started a fight with them.

1797
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:13,673
This mother Fucker,
I don't know is the Uchi Mata though 

1798
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:17,370
with it when they throw you,
this is a couple of those,

1799
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:18,393
holy shit.
He threw my buddy through the fucking 

1800
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:22,860
plate glass window.
Oh Shit.

1801
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:27,310
Did the mic drop and walked off and I,
I just had a standard like holy fuck.

1802
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:31,320
Threw him through a plate glass plate 
down downtown Colorado Springs,

1803
01:12:31,321 --> 01:12:32,154
Colorado.
Like we are in the down in the bar 

1804
01:12:33,901 --> 01:12:35,190
district fight started.

1805
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:37,760
Not even,
the dude just was like whatever.

1806
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:38,603
My buddy came at him and he just grabbed
me and fucking threw him through the 

1807
01:12:40,591 --> 01:12:42,180
window and I was like,
you win.

1808
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:43,291
Well,
you know,

1809
01:12:43,291 --> 01:12:47,610
one of the things that we're really 
early on MMA is there's certain guys,

1810
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:49,690
there's just giant levels of Shit,
right?

1811
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,230
Like we're seeing that with Damien Maia,
right?

1812
01:12:52,231 --> 01:12:54,600
We saw the Damien Maia fight with Carlos
condit.

1813
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:55,613
There's levels of this Jujitsu and 
Damien Maia has got that Hixon gracie 

1814
01:12:59,521 --> 01:13:04,521
style Jujitsu and it's just perfect.
Technically just perfect.

1815
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:06,930
Everything he does is perfect.
Well,

1816
01:13:06,931 --> 01:13:09,660
there's like,
like when Kyra Prezi and first fought in

1817
01:13:09,661 --> 01:13:11,280
the UFC,
I remember going,

1818
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:12,690
oh,
okay,

1819
01:13:12,691 --> 01:13:14,610
I just haven't seen this level yet.
Right?

1820
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:15,563
Like this motherfucker's tossing people.
He would get that cow breezy in his 

1821
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:21,120
early days.
We'll get that over hook.

1822
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:22,013
He would get that over hook and he would
bump you and in launching send you 

1823
01:13:25,141 --> 01:13:28,680
flying and everybody went flying cargo 
through everybody.

1824
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:29,543
He came down Jackson and he threw me,
he throws everybody talk about like a 

1825
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,073
morale killer.
You get thrown in front of millions of 

1826
01:13:36,091 --> 01:13:36,750
people.
You're like,

1827
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,790
oh fuck.
And he throws you perfect.

1828
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:39,690
Yeah.
You know,

1829
01:13:39,691 --> 01:13:44,100
he is a gene labelle gokarn conviction.
You know,

1830
01:13:44,101 --> 01:13:45,670
it's like that whole,
uh,

1831
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:49,950
that whole fucking lineage of Jew of 
judo is very strong.

1832
01:13:49,951 --> 01:13:52,050
That highest on grappling.
That's very,

1833
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:56,370
very strong lineage of judo.
They have strong judo mat and you know,

1834
01:13:56,371 --> 01:13:57,204
and that's where Ronda came from.
She spent a lot of her time there as 

1835
01:13:58,621 --> 01:14:00,240
well under judo,
judo,

1836
01:14:00,241 --> 01:14:02,730
gene judo.
Jeans is like always at our fights.

1837
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:03,990
You know,
is she coming back?

1838
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,660
You've got to talk to her brother.
I'm talking to her.

1839
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:07,791
I haven't either.
I don't,

1840
01:14:07,791 --> 01:14:09,310
I don't have the drive time.
Rhonda.

1841
01:14:09,450 --> 01:14:11,920
I always feel weird like when someone 
loses a fight,

1842
01:14:11,921 --> 01:14:15,610
like if I reach out to them,
I just always feel weird,

1843
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:18,320
you know?
I always feel like I don't want to,

1844
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:19,850
if I want to,
I want,

1845
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:22,690
if I see someone put y'all four to one 
on you buddy,

1846
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:24,840
come on evenings the one bro.
Keep your motherfucking game.

1847
01:14:24,850 --> 01:14:26,470
My brother.
Yeah,

1848
01:14:26,471 --> 01:14:29,630
but the eight tobacco and smoke weed 
probably really close.

1849
01:14:33,610 --> 01:14:38,610
This one's done.
Gone in like levels of uh,

1850
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:39,820
like,
you know,

1851
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:40,653
you see levels of everything in sport 
and I think that's one of the things 

1852
01:14:42,641 --> 01:14:43,510
you're showing,
man.

1853
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:45,550
I think you're showing a level of 
kickboxing.

1854
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,410
There's a very fucking,
when you,

1855
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:49,330
you're hitting those kinds of 
combinations.

1856
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:54,320
Now I believe in my wrestling.
I think that's the big key in the coat.

1857
01:14:54,321 --> 01:14:55,900
A fight.
And in the rick story fight,

1858
01:14:55,901 --> 01:14:58,330
you took both those guys down and I 
think they were probably like,

1859
01:14:58,420 --> 01:14:59,500
what?
Yeah,

1860
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:00,760
what the fuck.
But I mean,

1861
01:15:00,761 --> 01:15:03,340
I just,
the competence in my takedown defense is

1862
01:15:03,341 --> 01:15:07,510
allowing me to really open up and 
believing in myself is really,

1863
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:09,370
like I said,
when I reinvented myself,

1864
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:10,690
you know,
I just started like,

1865
01:15:10,691 --> 01:15:13,270
when someone comes into the gym,
I'm fucking you up.

1866
01:15:13,470 --> 01:15:14,330
Right?
You come down Jackson,

1867
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:16,390
I'm beating your motherfucking ass.
Like I understand.

1868
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:19,000
So it's just accept the fact you're not 
sparring.

1869
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,980
Yeah.
Anymore.

1870
01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:27,850
Back in the day when you come in,
you come in and we do mma rounds,

1871
01:15:27,851 --> 01:15:28,900
I'm fucking you up.
Right?

1872
01:15:29,170 --> 01:15:30,160
Yeah.
And uh,

1873
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:31,593
I see it like somehow figured out how do
I translate that into fight night 

1874
01:15:34,211 --> 01:15:35,044
because so many emotions,
this last fight I was the worst I've 

1875
01:15:38,741 --> 01:15:39,880
ever felt in my whole life.
You know,

1876
01:15:39,881 --> 01:15:42,100
I talked about that with Megan after the
fight.

1877
01:15:42,130 --> 01:15:42,963
I had the worst headache and was looking
Jimmy really sick all day before this 

1878
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:48,070
last fight.
And you,

1879
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:49,450
you know,
Greg Jackson's like,

1880
01:15:49,451 --> 01:15:51,670
cowboy,
this is what you train for every day.

1881
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:54,290
This has to be somebody on your worst 
is,

1882
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:56,020
is what you had to be prepared for it,
you know,

1883
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,540
and Ah,
fuck.

1884
01:15:58,541 --> 01:16:00,610
It was just warming up.
I didn't feel it.

1885
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:02,770
It wasn't until we started walking out 
that I was like,

1886
01:16:02,771 --> 01:16:05,020
fucking Kelvin this,
find the mother fucking gear.

1887
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:05,681
Let's go.
You know,

1888
01:16:05,681 --> 01:16:09,100
and had just had to get it this,
I think there's,

1889
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:09,983
uh,
there's a legit question that I asked 

1890
01:16:11,231 --> 01:16:13,300
you in the last podcast.
I said,

1891
01:16:13,301 --> 01:16:14,020
um,
Div,

1892
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:16,510
you ever talked to a mental coach?
You ever work with a mental coach?

1893
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:17,830
And you're like,
fuck no,

1894
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,680
I just go out there and kick some ass.
He blows it.

1895
01:16:20,930 --> 01:16:23,460
He buzzy and kicking ass it.
Um,

1896
01:16:23,770 --> 01:16:25,870
which I think is very admirable and it's
fun,

1897
01:16:26,110 --> 01:16:28,400
but I think you're,
you're at this,

1898
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:29,950
this,
there's this,

1899
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:33,490
there's this crust of the elite of the 
elite right now,

1900
01:16:33,491 --> 01:16:36,010
and you're at that crust.
And I think in that,

1901
01:16:36,190 --> 01:16:37,023
that top echelon,
when you get up there with the best of 

1902
01:16:40,091 --> 01:16:40,924
the best,
I don't think there's any room for 

1903
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:46,630
potential.
I think it all should be played out.

1904
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:47,703
You should,
you should have realized your potential 

1905
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:51,490
as much as possible by the time you got 
there.

1906
01:16:51,730 --> 01:16:52,563
And I think a factor in that is mindset.
And I don't think it's just being tough 

1907
01:16:56,861 --> 01:16:57,694
and going out there and kicking ass 
because you've already got that down to 

1908
01:17:00,071 --> 01:17:01,300
a science.
That's you.

1909
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:04,690
I think there are some strategies and 
there,

1910
01:17:04,691 --> 01:17:05,524
there are also some tools that you can 
use in terms of mental management that 

1911
01:17:09,171 --> 01:17:10,004
keep you in the proper channels and 
don't allow your mind to wander so you 

1912
01:17:13,311 --> 01:17:15,150
don't have to bring your mind back.
Yeah.

1913
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:16,160
And say,
ah,

1914
01:17:16,161 --> 01:17:17,570
I don't think about that.
Let's just,

1915
01:17:17,571 --> 01:17:19,070
we're here for,
this is what we came for.

1916
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:20,600
You don't need that pep talk.
Okay.

1917
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:22,550
Because you never go down that bad 
channel.

1918
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:24,890
You're always staying in these positive 
channels.

1919
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:26,960
And the thoughts come in like they do 
with anybody.

1920
01:17:26,961 --> 01:17:29,060
Like when I meditate,
when I get in a tank,

1921
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:31,280
people think you just go in there and 
use zen out.

1922
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:33,380
No,
I start thinking about stupid shit.

1923
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:35,980
I thought I started thinking about God,
I gotta clean my fucking office.

1924
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:37,550
I'm such a Slob.
You know,

1925
01:17:37,551 --> 01:17:38,230
like,
uh,

1926
01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:39,063
a little things.
You start thinking dumb shit and put it 

1927
01:17:41,610 --> 01:17:46,010
down and take them back in and uh,
and mental coat.

1928
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:47,450
I'm going to connect you to vinny 
shoreman.

1929
01:17:47,810 --> 01:17:49,790
Vinny shoreman is the guy that works 
with Joe Schilling.

1930
01:17:50,150 --> 01:17:51,200
He works with,
uh,

1931
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:53,780
Ian Mccall.
I've done two sessions with him.

1932
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:55,180
He's a hypnotist.
Okay.

1933
01:17:55,190 --> 01:17:56,023
These all total,
he's also a Moitai commentator and a 

1934
01:17:58,881 --> 01:18:02,100
coach and he knows his shit,
especially when it comes to striking and

1935
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:04,250
I think you would get along with him 
just because of that.

1936
01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:06,240
Right?
But he's got some really,

1937
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:09,650
I've done two podcasts with him too.
You can listen to the podcast he's got,

1938
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:10,513
he makes some real legitimate points.
So when it comes to understanding how 

1939
01:18:13,191 --> 01:18:14,024
the mind works,
the tricks you can play on you and how 

1940
01:18:16,041 --> 01:18:19,440
bad decisions from the past can fuck 
with you in,

1941
01:18:19,441 --> 01:18:20,274
in terms of like bad things sort of 
define you and you've got to figure out 

1942
01:18:23,781 --> 01:18:24,614
a way to alleviate yourself from an,
he responds to my meeting with him 

1943
01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:33,760
before or after the BMT trip before,
before we got to get ready,

1944
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:35,240
get ready,
get ready.

1945
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,510
When those astronauts go into space,
Bro,

1946
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:43,810
they fucking,
they don't just do I apres the Sharman.

1947
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:47,300
He's the one who's going to put on the 
whole thing.

1948
01:18:47,301 --> 01:18:48,134
He plays the music,
he plays these South American 

1949
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:53,240
[inaudible] that were recorded by him in
the jungle.

1950
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,060
It goes deep.
Fuck.

1951
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,100
It goes deep.
But what I think,

1952
01:18:58,190 --> 01:18:59,023
I think you know,
and I think you're already coaching 

1953
01:19:01,551 --> 01:19:04,910
yourself by this,
like reinventing yourself,

1954
01:19:04,911 --> 01:19:05,420
right?
Right.

1955
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:08,330
Reevaluating your diet,
starting to add supplementation,

1956
01:19:08,331 --> 01:19:09,164
taking care of yourself better,
approaching things in a more 

1957
01:19:10,611 --> 01:19:12,310
professional way,
cutting out the sparring,

1958
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:15,440
working entirely on drilling,
and you were seeing all these results.

1959
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:18,080
Choosing to go to one 70 and be 
healthier when you're fighting,

1960
01:19:18,230 --> 01:19:21,500
you're seeing all these results.
All of these results are like this.

1961
01:19:21,501 --> 01:19:24,500
Gravitation towards improvement and 
advancement.

1962
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:27,950
And I think that there's a thing that 
men have and I'm guilty of it.

1963
01:19:28,010 --> 01:19:29,060
We all are,
well,

1964
01:19:29,061 --> 01:19:30,990
we don't want help.
That's why women rise.

1965
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:34,100
Like men don't want direction.
I know where I'm gone.

1966
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:35,630
Don't worry about it.
I mean,

1967
01:19:35,631 --> 01:19:36,464
it's classic.
My wife does it all the time and I know 

1968
01:19:37,521 --> 01:19:40,010
where I'm going sometimes.
I'm not even exactly sure,

1969
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:40,893
sure.
But what I know is I don't want to hear 

1970
01:19:41,781 --> 01:19:44,870
her tell me where I'm going because if I
was just driving on my own,

1971
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:46,670
I'd figure it out.
Like it would be no problem.

1972
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:48,090
But when someone doesn't think you're 
fee,

1973
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:49,123
it's like men have a real issue with um,
with being coached on things that could 

1974
01:19:56,601 --> 01:19:58,730
be potentially thought of his 
weaknesses.

1975
01:19:58,780 --> 01:19:59,613
Sure.
Like men don't want to go to like a 

1976
01:20:00,441 --> 01:20:02,990
couple's counseling and have some other 
dude tell,

1977
01:20:03,070 --> 01:20:06,020
tell you how to communicate better with 
your woman or your man,

1978
01:20:06,050 --> 01:20:06,930
you know,
whatever your,

1979
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:08,013
your man,

1980
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:10,770
I can't guys go to cal can't go down 
that path.

1981
01:20:10,771 --> 01:20:11,604
That's what it was like.
I got a peek and I drank too much 

1982
01:20:16,450 --> 01:20:20,760
American house.
Go ahead cause I'm glad you left.

1983
01:20:20,761 --> 01:20:22,720
I don't know what the fuck I was saying.
I was going,

1984
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:25,320
I was killing out about something 
completely preposterous.

1985
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:28,680
What was I saying?
Oh,

1986
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:32,040
we have a men have a do have a problem.
Um,

1987
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:32,903
a lot of us do with,
I'm thinking that you are miss your 

1988
01:20:37,051 --> 01:20:37,884
mistakes.
You are your fault and you are your 

1989
01:20:39,631 --> 01:20:40,920
weaknesses.
So they,

1990
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:41,813
they,
they get branded into your system and 

1991
01:20:44,581 --> 01:20:46,260
once he seems get brandon into your 
system,

1992
01:20:46,261 --> 01:20:47,094
they're really difficult to shake cause 
you sort of define yourself not by the 

1993
01:20:50,821 --> 01:20:52,800
lessons you've learned from those 
experiences.

1994
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:53,693
And uh,
you being this conscious entity that is 

1995
01:20:54,991 --> 01:20:55,824
existing right now,
not in a state of mistakes and have 

1996
01:20:58,801 --> 01:21:00,150
errors but of life.

1997
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:01,013
You're living right now with information
based on your past and you can go 

1998
01:21:04,111 --> 01:21:07,860
forward from that and be like really 
positive and like go,

1999
01:21:07,861 --> 01:21:08,694
wow,
I'm glad I went through all those awful 

2000
01:21:09,481 --> 01:21:10,314
things cause I know that I could be a 
real twat or I could be really retarded 

2001
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:16,650
or it could be really foolish or 
impulsive and I could mess my whole life

2002
01:21:16,651 --> 01:21:18,240
up.
But I am this guy right now.

2003
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:22,410
If you don't log,
learn that,

2004
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:24,300
then you can go through this life going,
hey,

2005
01:21:24,301 --> 01:21:25,560
I don't give a fuck.
This is me,

2006
01:21:25,561 --> 01:21:28,410
this is who I am and I don't want to,
I don't want to any coaching,

2007
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:31,110
oh I don't want any advice.
But there's a bunch of other people that

2008
01:21:31,111 --> 01:21:31,944
have gone through similar experiences 
and you can call them coaches or just 

2009
01:21:34,861 --> 01:21:35,694
call them human beings with information.
And there's people that have gone 

2010
01:21:37,981 --> 01:21:38,814
through a bunch of experiences that are 
real similar to the ones that you're 

2011
01:21:41,521 --> 01:21:42,960
going to go through or I'm going to go 
through.

2012
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:44,153
And these people were talking about 
learning from other men that like 

2013
01:21:47,671 --> 01:21:51,900
learning shit about like weaknesses,
but like emotions and about like,

2014
01:21:51,901 --> 01:21:53,100
uh,
fears and,

2015
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,160
and it just your own mortality,
you know,

2016
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:56,994
all those things are real issues.
Men Don't like learn them from other 

2017
01:21:59,761 --> 01:22:00,660
men.
So you're like,

2018
01:22:00,661 --> 01:22:05,661
I don't need that shit.
You know what I'm talking about?

2019
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,840
And I was talking about you got to get 
back in the back,

2020
01:22:07,841 --> 01:22:08,670
bro.
You took the lead.

2021
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:12,150
I can only reset where he sat and,
and other news.

2022
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:15,840
Yesterday I outfitted for a new movie.
I'm doing western.

2023
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,400
You're doing a western.
How weird.

2024
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:20,760
It's actually not a movie.
It's a netflix series.

2025
01:22:20,761 --> 01:22:22,800
I've got six episodes.
Holy Shit.

2026
01:22:22,830 --> 01:22:23,370
Cool.
Right?

2027
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:25,470
That's gigantic.
I got to do cowboy shit.

2028
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:26,880
What is it?
It's a,

2029
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:28,140
it's called godless.
It's,

2030
01:22:28,141 --> 01:22:28,661
uh,
it's,

2031
01:22:28,661 --> 01:22:30,900
uh,
I'm part of a gang,

2032
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,370
the train robbery gang.

2033
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,710
Holy Shit.
And I'm fucking pumped,

2034
01:22:34,711 --> 01:22:35,430
man.
I'm excited.

2035
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:37,260
Wow.
That's amazing.

2036
01:22:37,290 --> 01:22:40,350
And how I was starting not on the 12th 
have you ever acted before?

2037
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:42,300
Well,
I did the always sunny in Philadelphia,

2038
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:44,430
but I played me,
here's what I think.

2039
01:22:44,670 --> 01:22:45,503
I think you're going to kill it right 
out of the box and we're going to show 

2040
01:22:47,281 --> 01:22:49,800
the world how fucking easy acting as 
God.

2041
01:22:49,810 --> 01:22:50,643
Damn.
People think that shit is hard and I'm 

2042
01:22:51,871 --> 01:22:53,190
not,
I'm not a good actor,

2043
01:22:53,191 --> 01:22:54,024
by the way.
I should just say that right off the 

2044
01:22:54,361 --> 01:22:55,194
bat.
But I know a lot of people can go right 

2045
01:22:57,481 --> 01:23:00,210
from other shit and become actors.
Yeah.

2046
01:23:00,211 --> 01:23:01,044
I mean,
I'm more excited about fucking shooting 

2047
01:23:03,691 --> 01:23:04,950
guns and riding horses and shit.

2048
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:07,900
I bet you are.
He should be.

2049
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,490
That's real.
Yeah.

2050
01:23:09,491 --> 01:23:10,001
I mean,
yeah.

2051
01:23:10,001 --> 01:23:12,040
You don't want him to get too pumped up,
up fake shit.

2052
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:14,310
It's going to be do some fake shit.
Oh Dude.

2053
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:18,210
You get to wear makeup outside of his 
beard.

2054
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:19,300
They tell me,
they tell me,

2055
01:23:19,301 --> 01:23:20,680
Kevin,
we need you to grow your beard,

2056
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:21,820
all your hair out.
And I said,

2057
01:23:21,821 --> 01:23:25,580
well,
this is a little bit of a problem on the

2058
01:23:25,581 --> 01:23:26,890
top here,
but uh,

2059
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:28,620
I'll try.
I'll go ahead and give them,

2060
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:30,510
why you to grow your hair long and tell 
me to get me a wig.

2061
01:23:30,511 --> 01:23:32,640
Like Kevin Costner was.
They said Wiki.

2062
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:34,690
I said,
wigs are uncomfortable that they want to

2063
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:36,420
a grunge.
Look out in this at hard.

2064
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:39,110
I can do grunge.
Can't you just be a,

2065
01:23:39,111 --> 01:23:41,920
a cowboy with a shaved head?
Did they have buzz cuts back then?

2066
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:44,110
I mean,
where would you buzz your head?

2067
01:23:44,111 --> 01:23:45,810
You'd shave it all and you'd let it grow
back.

2068
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:47,350
Little Buck knife,
not one of them.

2069
01:23:47,351 --> 01:23:50,140
Nice straight razors.
You use those a western deep,

2070
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:52,810
tight places that people go to all her 
Walworth,

2071
01:23:53,170 --> 01:23:55,240
raping and pillaging across the 
countryside.

2072
01:23:55,370 --> 01:23:58,300
You can't fire lit mere cut.

2073
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,080
That's what they would do.
And they would,

2074
01:24:02,081 --> 01:24:02,914
uh,
sharpen it with a strop sharpen with 

2075
01:24:04,511 --> 01:24:06,430
that leather thing.
Never understood that,

2076
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:09,040
oh fuck this lab leather.
Sharpen a razor blade.

2077
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:10,900
Do you understand?
I do not.

2078
01:24:10,901 --> 01:24:12,670
I,
I buy a new razor every time.

2079
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:15,010
Here's a rabbit hole that I've gone down
recently.

2080
01:24:15,130 --> 01:24:19,500
I've been going on these instagram pages
of custom knife makers.

2081
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:21,730
Who these dudes,
are you the person that likes all those?

2082
01:24:21,970 --> 01:24:23,380
Is that why keep coming up on my,
uh,

2083
01:24:23,410 --> 01:24:25,900
probably my like feet.
I like that shit.

2084
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:29,050
Who likes to these big juicy but girls 
and all these fucking nights.

2085
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:33,130
This guy,
this guy,

2086
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:35,470
these guys there.
Well,

2087
01:24:35,490 --> 01:24:36,910
I'm sure there's some girls out there 
too,

2088
01:24:36,911 --> 01:24:38,750
but I've only followed guys that are 
there.

2089
01:24:38,810 --> 01:24:39,643
They have their own forging facilities 
and they made the shoes and everything 

2090
01:24:43,301 --> 01:24:44,134
after I seen it.
They're clanging the fucking metal and 

2091
01:24:45,491 --> 01:24:48,040
putting in the fire and making handmade 
knives and shit.

2092
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:49,340
Dude,
I'm obsessed with this.

2093
01:24:49,390 --> 01:24:50,140
I've,
I've,

2094
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:52,120
you forced me to creep just because 
they're on the,

2095
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:56,200
on the whatever,
the whatever that microscope.

2096
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:57,930
Yeah.
What does that fucking thing?

2097
01:24:57,970 --> 01:25:02,970
A search search search page.
It might be because we follow each other

2098
01:25:03,071 --> 01:25:04,690
and the,
I'm going to those sites all the time.

2099
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,270
We've been fascinated by it.
Man.

2100
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:10,750
I don't know what my original point was.
It's the cool shit.

2101
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:14,440
It's a lot of people making cool shit 
out there,

2102
01:25:14,441 --> 01:25:15,274
but that's the rabbit hole.
I've gone down this whole idea that 

2103
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:22,270
someone is good at making that and how 
good you are speaking to people's souls.

2104
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:23,440
See,
but this is easy.

2105
01:25:23,470 --> 01:25:24,520
This is just talk.
No,

2106
01:25:24,521 --> 01:25:26,410
it's not though.
It's not easy.

2107
01:25:26,770 --> 01:25:28,450
What you do is not easy.
You could not,

2108
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:29,950
I couldn't just go get somebody off the 
street,

2109
01:25:29,951 --> 01:25:30,850
put them here and be like,
all right,

2110
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:31,923
I need you to interview somebody for 
three to five hours and keep it 

2111
01:25:34,661 --> 01:25:37,840
entertaining and have no dead time and 
know what the fuck you're talking about.

2112
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:39,550
See,
that's where you're wrong.

2113
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:41,860
I don't not know what the fuck I'm 
talking about.

2114
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:45,160
What I'm talking about,
what you're getting into your dmt speech

2115
01:25:45,161 --> 01:25:45,994
was he had me,
you had me wrapping my arm rate for a 

2116
01:25:49,091 --> 01:25:49,924
main line drag,
so I'm ready for it given that one 

2117
01:25:51,311 --> 01:25:52,870
before.
I know that one real good.

2118
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:55,280
It's like asking you to throw your and 
how it could be hammered.

2119
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:57,360
Does that piss you off when you're at 
the shows?

2120
01:25:57,370 --> 01:25:59,380
I've been to a lot of your shows and 
everyone's always like,

2121
01:25:59,870 --> 01:26:01,060
do you do,
when you ask people,

2122
01:26:01,061 --> 01:26:02,080
what do you want to type in there?
I was like,

2123
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:03,920
dude,
you're like fuck you dude.

2124
01:26:03,921 --> 01:26:04,070
I do

2125
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:05,020
that.
So that's,

2126
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:06,710
I just tell them,
go on youtube.

2127
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:07,610
Yeah,
go on Youtube.

2128
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:08,473
I can't talk about any more and there's 
nothing funny I could say about it 

2129
01:26:10,671 --> 01:26:11,504
either and it's definitely not something
you'd see in front of a giant crowd of 

2130
01:26:13,311 --> 01:26:14,630
people where they're going to 
understand.

2131
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:15,613
I try to explain Doug's stand old paddle
whole bit once cause I got him high on 

2132
01:26:18,351 --> 01:26:21,650
DMT and blew his mind and he went and 
did a whole bit about,

2133
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:25,520
about me and him doing dmt in my house.
I thought he was dead.

2134
01:26:25,670 --> 01:26:28,910
He was moaning and foaming like 
legitimately foaming at the mouth.

2135
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:32,450
He was aligned down,
gone for 15 minutes.

2136
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:33,583
No,
it was a solid three of moaning with a 

2137
01:26:36,861 --> 01:26:38,840
point where I'm going,
oh boy.

2138
01:26:38,870 --> 01:26:40,340
He was,
maybe he was just purging.

2139
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:42,050
Well I just started thinking,
what did I do?

2140
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:44,390
Like I made doug do what I do,
right.

2141
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:45,170
So I'm thinking,
Hey,

2142
01:26:45,170 --> 01:26:46,850
he'll be fine.
That's why I'm not doing what you do.

2143
01:26:46,851 --> 01:26:47,684
You say three giant hits,
I'm going to do what you want and a 

2144
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:51,470
half.
Here's my point.

2145
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,900
You fucking healthy.
Doug.

2146
01:26:53,901 --> 01:26:56,270
Stan hope smokes two packs of cigarettes
a day.

2147
01:26:56,450 --> 01:26:58,190
He gets up,
starts drinking,

2148
01:26:58,191 --> 01:27:02,730
stops when he falls asleep.
So now it matters of your,

2149
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,700
your physical,
well,

2150
01:27:04,701 --> 01:27:07,970
I just think what was going on and I 
wasn't bad for him.

2151
01:27:07,971 --> 01:27:09,200
He came back,
he was fine.

2152
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:12,470
It's a natural drug that is in the human
body.

2153
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:15,860
You don't overdose from it.
No one's ever died from smoking.

2154
01:27:15,861 --> 01:27:18,020
DMT done dmt.
I mean when a lot,

2155
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:19,613
how can we,
how can we have there now that for your 

2156
01:27:22,190 --> 01:27:23,023
pumps,
we don't have a very big audience of 

2157
01:27:24,921 --> 01:27:25,790
people that can pull it.
They're like,

2158
01:27:25,791 --> 01:27:26,460
yeah,
there's,

2159
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:31,250
you've definitely oded on lsd or on 
alcohol.

2160
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,140
This is what I think without being 
irresponsible.

2161
01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:35,480
I think that if you have any 
psychological issues,

2162
01:27:35,481 --> 01:27:38,300
you probably shouldn't do anything that 
perturbs your,

2163
01:27:38,301 --> 01:27:39,134
your,
your,

2164
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:40,170
your state,
your stuff.

2165
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:44,720
So I should not do it.
I'm fucking crazy batshit crazy.

2166
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:48,800
But I think that saying that,
just saying that getting out of the way,

2167
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:53,000
it could benefit a whole lot of people.
There's a whole lot of people that could

2168
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:54,710
benefit from it.
That's what I'm saying.

2169
01:27:54,890 --> 01:27:56,530
All right.
But I think just for me,

2170
01:27:56,610 --> 01:27:59,030
I'm going in as a way to do it through 
Kundalini Yoga.

2171
01:27:59,031 --> 01:28:00,620
Apparently you do,
you know,

2172
01:28:00,621 --> 01:28:01,660
Denny,
uh,

2173
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,160
proper coast.
He's one a 80 bravo's black belts,

2174
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:07,130
maybe seen him with me a bunch of times.
He works for the UFC sometimes.

2175
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:08,250
He,
um,

2176
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:09,083
uh,
Kinda does what Eddie used to do where 

2177
01:28:10,341 --> 01:28:15,341
he recognizes what they do is like,
they're filming a certain positions.

2178
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:17,750
Like when Damien Maia finished Carlos 
Condit,

2179
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:18,440
right?
Like,

2180
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:21,170
we need to be marked Ella grotto when 
telegraph tase out,

2181
01:28:21,390 --> 01:28:22,460
um,
d uh,

2182
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:25,130
denny will fill in the place.
So he understands the transitions.

2183
01:28:25,190 --> 01:28:27,520
So he'll pull that clip up for the 
replays.

2184
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:28,760
And,
um,

2185
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:29,593
denny is a,
a big proponent of Kundalini Yoga and 

2186
01:28:32,781 --> 01:28:34,670
he's also,
he's done dmt.

2187
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:37,880
And when he does Quinn Delaney,
he can achieve those states.

2188
01:28:37,881 --> 01:28:39,170
How?
I don't know,

2189
01:28:39,171 --> 01:28:41,210
I don't understand.
Kundolini I've never done it,

2190
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:42,223
but it's a fungus.
Coon Dalene Eenie Rimini is a series of 

2191
01:28:44,451 --> 01:28:45,284
exercises and meditations and yoga that 
are widely purported to achieve 

2192
01:28:50,571 --> 01:28:51,404
psychedelic states.
There's other ways to do it to this 

2193
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:54,473
hollow holotropic breathing.
There's like a psychedelic breathing 

2194
01:28:57,081 --> 01:29:02,081
method that you can do that can see DMT 
is produced the human body.

2195
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,320
So you just got to get your body to make
it.

2196
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:06,240
And so there's this sense that somehow 
there's,

2197
01:29:06,241 --> 01:29:07,074
there's ways that people have figured 
out where you can stimulate your body's 

2198
01:29:10,501 --> 01:29:12,840
production of his natural psychedelic 
chemical.

2199
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:16,790
So not just through taking it 
exogenously like smoking it or,

2200
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:21,230
or drinking it when you're taken Iowasca
but to make your home body produce it.

2201
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:22,073
And the,
and the reason behind it is for near 

2202
01:29:24,541 --> 01:29:25,231
death experience.
Right.

2203
01:29:25,231 --> 01:29:27,270
Does that make you feel okay?
I don't know.

2204
01:29:27,271 --> 01:29:30,810
What's the reason behind it?
I feel like I've experienced what you're

2205
01:29:30,811 --> 01:29:32,220
talking about.
When I almost died,

2206
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,030
everything I was seeing,
the most pain I've ever been in.

2207
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:37,950
I tipped the Garney over,
fucking threw a ball,

2208
01:29:37,951 --> 01:29:38,784
his blood,
and they put me back and then all of a 

2209
01:29:39,601 --> 01:29:43,020
sudden it's like overwhelming film 
feeling just overtook me.

2210
01:29:43,021 --> 01:29:45,750
And everything was just okay.
Like I was okay to die.

2211
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:47,790
It was craziest feeling I've ever had.
Like everything was,

2212
01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:49,740
I had neck,
no,

2213
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:53,730
no fear and I had no worries in the 
world.

2214
01:29:53,731 --> 01:29:54,564
Everything.
It was just like,

2215
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:55,613
okay,
like everything was just like a giant 

2216
01:29:56,971 --> 01:29:57,300
ease.

2217
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:59,400
It lifted off me.
I've heard of that before.

2218
01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:01,590
I haven't had that experience but I've 
heard that before.

2219
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:02,663
Well don't try and die.
I have a friend almost died in a car 

2220
01:30:04,801 --> 01:30:09,030
accident and she said the same thing.
She said right after the car hit and she

2221
01:30:09,031 --> 01:30:09,864
got smashed by this,
this car slamming it like take got t 

2222
01:30:13,021 --> 01:30:13,854
boned,
she flew across the other side of the 

2223
01:30:16,111 --> 01:30:16,944
car.
It's smashed into her friend and there 

2224
01:30:18,751 --> 01:30:22,050
was this immediate like feeling of 
peace.

2225
01:30:22,470 --> 01:30:24,430
Okay,
so media is feeling of like everything's

2226
01:30:24,431 --> 01:30:27,420
going to be all right in this weird love
sensation.

2227
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:30,120
I didn't see any geographic shapes 
telling me,

2228
01:30:30,590 --> 01:30:31,423
well you cause you were knocking on the 
door so then you kind of go and sneak 

2229
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:33,863
out and get it event.
Well that's what the worry is that when 

2230
01:30:38,671 --> 01:30:41,340
you're doing dmt,
what you're seeing is the afterlife.

2231
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:42,383
And you're seeing that there is some 
place that the soul goes and that the 

2232
01:30:45,241 --> 01:30:50,150
soul is not just a concept that's based 
in mysticism and lies and fantasies,

2233
01:30:50,151 --> 01:30:52,130
myths and lies.
Oh,

2234
01:30:52,140 --> 01:30:54,540
there's a lot of people look at things 
that you can't prove.

2235
01:30:54,570 --> 01:30:55,480
Absolutely.
It's right.

2236
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:56,990
Yeah.
That's the big word,

2237
01:30:57,030 --> 01:30:57,863
right?
Like if you look at something like a 

2238
01:30:58,501 --> 01:30:59,580
soul,
like you can't prove it.

2239
01:30:59,610 --> 01:31:01,020
You're right.
You can't prove it.

2240
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:04,830
Definitely we all agree on that.
But let's examine what the fuck it means

2241
01:31:04,831 --> 01:31:07,150
to be a person.
We don't know what it,

2242
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:07,993
what it means to be conscious.
There's all these ways we can define it 

2243
01:31:10,801 --> 01:31:11,634
and talk about it where it makes sense,
but it does not make sense that you are 

2244
01:31:14,161 --> 01:31:14,994
looking through your eyes and live in 
the life of Donald's Roney and I'm 

2245
01:31:17,611 --> 01:31:18,444
looking through my eyes and I'm living 
the life of Joe Rogan and we've become 

2246
01:31:21,121 --> 01:31:22,520
pals and we have stories.

2247
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:26,130
We talk and you say things with your 
mouth and icon to understand what you're

2248
01:31:26,131 --> 01:31:26,964
saying.
And I say things and I hope you 

2249
01:31:28,081 --> 01:31:29,700
understand what I'm saying.
And we,

2250
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:31,150
we laugh,
we have a good time.

2251
01:31:31,151 --> 01:31:31,984
And drink a few budweiser.
It's like this is a fucking bizarre 

2252
01:31:34,021 --> 01:31:39,021
state to be clinging to a circular ball 
like some gigantic,

2253
01:31:40,231 --> 01:31:41,064
huge pack of water and dirt and rock 
that's hurling through infinity with 

2254
01:31:45,841 --> 01:31:49,500
scis seven others.
It's so strange.

2255
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:52,170
It's just strange.
It can be life.

2256
01:31:52,171 --> 01:31:53,004
Is waste stranger or as strange as 
anything you're going to experience on 

2257
01:31:55,771 --> 01:31:57,600
DMT.
We just used to live.

2258
01:31:58,110 --> 01:32:00,160
I like life.
I like life to life

2259
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:01,570
is awesome.
So what,

2260
01:32:01,571 --> 01:32:02,950
uh,
let's talk about space.

2261
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:05,290
Let's go there.
Let's do it.

2262
01:32:05,291 --> 01:32:06,100
What do you,
what,

2263
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:09,940
what the fuck is out there man?
I mean everything.

2264
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:12,820
So I talked to Bj Penn.
He thinks the world is flying.

2265
01:32:12,910 --> 01:32:15,310
I understand this.
How would this crazy,

2266
01:32:15,311 --> 01:32:16,144
is that right?
He believes the world is flat and that 

2267
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:22,180
when you take off in an airplane,
you just do like a big,

2268
01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:26,380
you don't go around the world.
You just kind of do like a boom.

2269
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:27,910
Here's the thing.
Why?

2270
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:30,590
Why would anybody lie about that?
I where's the,

2271
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:32,830
where's the money in line about the 
earth being flat?

2272
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:34,660
It's so stupid.
So stupid.

2273
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:35,553
It's so stupid.
He thinks Columbia Columbus might've 

2274
01:32:37,151 --> 01:32:38,350
been onto something.
Listen man,

2275
01:32:38,410 --> 01:32:40,300
there's a bunch of people making youtube
videos.

2276
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:41,253
Okay.
And these youtube videos confused the 

2277
01:32:42,341 --> 01:32:45,790
fuck out of people that don't understand
physics like you or me.

2278
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:46,683
I don't understand physics or night 
comes down to when you sail around the 

2279
01:32:50,441 --> 01:32:52,330
world.
Yeah.

2280
01:32:53,020 --> 01:32:56,160
You go around the world,
go round little fucking world fall gps.

2281
01:32:56,250 --> 01:32:57,840
Yeah,
follow the math.

2282
01:32:58,510 --> 01:33:00,490
You're just kind of,
what do you just hit a wall?

2283
01:33:00,491 --> 01:33:01,324
Like every image shown by NASA is a 
composite of that's exactly actually 

2284
01:33:05,730 --> 01:33:07,390
right.
So shut the fuck up.

2285
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:10,270
Look that you can go into space station.
You cuts,

2286
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:12,060
you can see it.
There's a video.

2287
01:33:12,061 --> 01:33:14,170
Has everybody that's been this space 
station lying.

2288
01:33:14,171 --> 01:33:16,450
Every Russian,
every American,

2289
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:20,110
they're all a bunch of liars.
And you baby girl Illuminati.

2290
01:33:20,190 --> 01:33:21,023
You're not stupid.
That is to think that everyone has been 

2291
01:33:22,361 --> 01:33:24,700
faking every image of the earth being 
round.

2292
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:28,100
Oh and coincidentally the earth is the 
only flat thing we've ever found.

2293
01:33:28,110 --> 01:33:30,130
The fucking universe.
Cause all the moons,

2294
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:31,870
all the planets,
Jupiter,

2295
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:33,280
all that shit's round as fuck.

2296
01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:36,250
What's that?
These are tree stumps by the way.

2297
01:33:36,490 --> 01:33:40,270
According to the flat earth theory,
every giant rock were being trolled.

2298
01:33:40,330 --> 01:33:41,440
Dude,
this is not real.

2299
01:33:41,650 --> 01:33:43,280
This is,
that's a trees down.

2300
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:47,440
How big would that treat is a,
an elaborate four chan host.

2301
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:51,220
There's slowly trolling America.
Oh,

2302
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:54,490
like Pandora size tree does definitely 
make sense,

2303
01:33:54,491 --> 01:33:55,630
right?
Wow,

2304
01:33:55,730 --> 01:33:57,010
that's legit.
And what happened to it?

2305
01:33:57,140 --> 01:33:58,640
I got knock,
knock.

2306
01:33:58,641 --> 01:34:02,800
I know about the dinosaurs.
Don't think the reality,

2307
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:06,760
the reality of earth and space is crazy 
enough.

2308
01:34:06,761 --> 01:34:10,810
You dump cunts,
you don't have to fake conspiracies.

2309
01:34:10,930 --> 01:34:15,490
The reality of this whole thing is so 
fucking Uber Bizarre.

2310
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:20,110
We're in a giant ball that's floating in
the sky.

2311
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:23,290
Above us is something a quarter.
The size of us,

2312
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:24,273
it's floating in the sky and it doesn't 
even fucking spin and you need it there 

2313
01:34:27,970 --> 01:34:32,740
and it regulates the tides and if it was
any further or any closer,

2314
01:34:32,770 --> 01:34:36,010
everybody we'd be dead.
That's crazy.

2315
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:36,993
That itself is fucking crazy.
You don't have to pretend you're seeing 

2316
01:34:39,401 --> 01:34:40,234
trees.
You don't have to pretend the earth is 

2317
01:34:41,471 --> 01:34:43,180
flat.
You fucking retards.

2318
01:34:43,270 --> 01:34:45,730
That doesn't have any faith comes in 
like they're saying,

2319
01:34:45,731 --> 01:34:46,564
how can all of these things fall?
How can all these things they don't 

2320
01:34:50,051 --> 01:34:50,830
know.
Jamie,

2321
01:34:50,830 --> 01:34:52,460
explain.
I can I,

2322
01:34:53,850 --> 01:34:54,683
I took physics like in high school a 
little bit in college and one Eddie was 

2323
01:34:56,711 --> 01:34:57,740
going on rant.
It was,

2324
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:58,010
I

2325
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:59,450
couldn't remember all the things to say 
it,

2326
01:34:59,451 --> 01:35:00,284
so it wasn't going to break out physics 
laws and whatnot to break down each 

2327
01:35:02,661 --> 01:35:03,494
step.
But if you do physics experiments in 

2328
01:35:05,031 --> 01:35:05,864
class,
you will easily see all of these steps 

2329
01:35:06,891 --> 01:35:08,270
and you,
and it blows your mind.

2330
01:35:08,271 --> 01:35:09,110
You're like,
oh my God,

2331
01:35:09,111 --> 01:35:09,530
it's,
it's,

2332
01:35:09,530 --> 01:35:10,363
it's amazing how this works.
There's math that's been done over 

2333
01:35:12,891 --> 01:35:14,230
hundreds of years that full

2334
01:35:14,260 --> 01:35:15,093
on all these people that have been 
studying this stuff for centuries and 

2335
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:22,470
building upon all of the knowledge of 
the people before them.

2336
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:25,020
Like when,
when a guy like,

2337
01:35:25,021 --> 01:35:27,060
here's a perfect example,
you could relate to martial arts.

2338
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:28,273
Well,
we're,

2339
01:35:28,550 --> 01:35:29,383
we're seeing today when you see guys 
like yourself or guys like Damien Maia 

2340
01:35:32,461 --> 01:35:36,690
or guys like wonder boy or any of the 
top fighters today are mighty mouse.

2341
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:37,853
You're seeing the highest expression of 
martial arts that has ever existed in 

2342
01:35:42,541 --> 01:35:44,220
the world.
It is a fact.

2343
01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:45,143
It's an undeniable fact.
Anybody that tells me that people from 

2344
01:35:47,161 --> 01:35:47,994
the past were better.
You don't know what the fuck you're 

2345
01:35:49,321 --> 01:35:50,460
talking about.
There's,

2346
01:35:50,461 --> 01:35:54,540
there's no chance in hell.
This is an undeniable fact,

2347
01:35:54,590 --> 01:35:56,040
that objective fact,
okay,

2348
01:35:56,250 --> 01:36:00,960
well this didn't happen immediately.
It didn't happen because one guy figured

2349
01:36:00,961 --> 01:36:01,794
out how to fight.
Like this is one guy in Brooklyn that 

2350
01:36:03,421 --> 01:36:05,190
has his fucking street fight in class.

2351
01:36:05,290 --> 01:36:08,670
It's got this deadly touch of death that
he could do to people and all this other

2352
01:36:08,671 --> 01:36:11,100
things you've been to is all bullshit.
They think that chokes work,

2353
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:12,810
chokes don't work.
They don't work on me.

2354
01:36:12,930 --> 01:36:14,820
When he chokes don't work,
then you go back to your friend.

2355
01:36:14,821 --> 01:36:16,290
Chokes don't work.
The earth is flat.

2356
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:17,820
It's flat.
Are you sure it's flat?

2357
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:19,013
It's fucking bananas.
To think that someone is going to be 

2358
01:36:22,081 --> 01:36:27,081
able to figure if seeking,
manipulate the league minds so easy.

2359
01:36:27,270 --> 01:36:28,103
It's not even the weak minds is the 
uninformed mind busy and that watch 

2360
01:36:31,081 --> 01:36:32,490
youtube videos,
that's what it is.

2361
01:36:32,491 --> 01:36:35,520
It's not even that you're weak because a
lot of times when people speak well,

2362
01:36:35,550 --> 01:36:37,670
so what they says Lizard people have you
seen,

2363
01:36:37,671 --> 01:36:38,610
have you seen that as shit?

2364
01:36:40,790 --> 01:36:42,810
Right.
What the fuck is that?

2365
01:36:43,050 --> 01:36:44,580
It's all bullshit.
All Bullshit.

2366
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:48,480
These are people that are aliens,
but they,

2367
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:51,280
have you seen the youtube videos?
Have you seen?

2368
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:52,553
I've seen plenty of them,
but that was one of the David Eick 

2369
01:36:53,821 --> 01:36:54,450
things,
right?

2370
01:36:54,450 --> 01:36:55,283
He believed that all of the elites were 
reptilians grab tea and that's what it 

2371
01:36:58,081 --> 01:36:58,914
is.
And he defend that your reptilian and 

2372
01:37:00,121 --> 01:37:01,440
even,
and even a,

2373
01:37:01,450 --> 01:37:02,970
if you defend that you are obtaining 
even,

2374
01:37:02,971 --> 01:37:04,270
uh,
uh,

2375
01:37:04,330 --> 01:37:05,670
are you putting it up?
Oh yeah.

2376
01:37:05,671 --> 01:37:10,050
Do you see that said he is investigating
a possible extra terrestrial signal from

2377
01:37:10,051 --> 01:37:11,670
deep space.
Yeah.

2378
01:37:11,671 --> 01:37:13,710
They said this is nuts.
The contact.

2379
01:37:14,190 --> 01:37:15,023
Yeah.
Literally.

2380
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:17,490
Yeah.
Literally she's in it too.

2381
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:19,260
Dot.
Movie was dope as fuck.

2382
01:37:19,261 --> 01:37:21,900
Yeah.
Well that's the image they're trying to,

2383
01:37:21,930 --> 01:37:22,763
but this is a real,
a steady signal that they're 

2384
01:37:24,001 --> 01:37:26,070
investigating.
It is amazing,

2385
01:37:26,071 --> 01:37:28,920
man.
That movie contact was fucking bad ass,

2386
01:37:28,921 --> 01:37:29,430
by the way.

2387
01:37:29,430 --> 01:37:32,070
I loved that movie.
I mean there has to be,

2388
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:34,380
there has to be something outside of our
realm there.

2389
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:35,233
He's not just something,
here's how infinity is best explained 

2390
01:37:38,070 --> 01:37:39,990
his.
This is the best definition that I,

2391
01:37:40,070 --> 01:37:43,590
I've read.
Not only is the universe infinite,

2392
01:37:43,860 --> 01:37:44,693
but what that means is if you exist,
everything that has ever happened on 

2393
01:37:50,431 --> 01:37:54,900
this earth in the exact same order,
every pebble falling,

2394
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:56,333
the same crevice over and over again.
I mean with no variation at all is not 

2395
01:38:00,301 --> 01:38:02,550
just happened before.
Every word I've said,

2396
01:38:02,551 --> 01:38:07,470
including that pause has taken place in 
exactly the same way.

2397
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:08,453
Not just once,
but an infinite number of times where 

2398
01:38:11,941 --> 01:38:13,410
there is no end.
Why does,

2399
01:38:13,411 --> 01:38:14,244
that's what real infinity is.
So we can understand infinity because 

2400
01:38:16,861 --> 01:38:18,780
we're our brains.
Like if you tell someone,

2401
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:20,400
hey,
we drank six budweisers,

2402
01:38:20,401 --> 01:38:21,690
man,
you guys must have got fucked up.

2403
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:23,700
That makes sense.
You get those numbers right.

2404
01:38:24,210 --> 01:38:27,900
Do you really understand like when 
someone says 6,000

2405
01:38:27,901 --> 01:38:28,471
miles,
you go,

2406
01:38:28,471 --> 01:38:29,700
okay,
all right,

2407
01:38:29,701 --> 01:38:32,610
well the United States is how many 
thousand miles you've got to go,

2408
01:38:32,611 --> 01:38:34,920
how many thousand miles past that it 
gets a little blurry,

2409
01:38:34,921 --> 01:38:35,370
right?
Yeah.

2410
01:38:35,370 --> 01:38:37,500
And then you go,
all of the moon is 250,000

2411
01:38:37,501 --> 01:38:38,221
miles away.
Go,

2412
01:38:38,221 --> 01:38:40,290
what?
How far is that?

2413
01:38:40,410 --> 01:38:41,161
And you start thinking,
well,

2414
01:38:41,161 --> 01:38:42,230
the moon is a,
you know,

2415
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:44,190
how far is the sun?
And that's a million.

2416
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:44,761
Well,
this,

2417
01:38:44,761 --> 01:38:48,780
they found this fucking planet.
It's earthlike and it's four light years

2418
01:38:48,781 --> 01:38:50,250
away.
What's that?

2419
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:53,130
What's four light years?
How fast is light go?

2420
01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:54,770
I'm lost,
right?

2421
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:57,150
30 to a hundred feet a second.
Right?

2422
01:38:57,151 --> 01:38:57,984
So we'll,
we have his senses and what we have is 

2423
01:39:01,201 --> 01:39:02,034
an understanding of our environment 
that's immediate to us because we're 

2424
01:39:04,951 --> 01:39:05,784
basically monkeys that just a few 
thousand years ago were worried about 

2425
01:39:08,461 --> 01:39:09,420
being eaten by shit.

2426
01:39:09,420 --> 01:39:12,360
Right?
So finally we reached the stage where we

2427
01:39:12,361 --> 01:39:15,060
don't have to worry too much about being
eaten by Shit,

2428
01:39:15,090 --> 01:39:17,130
which is why shark videos are so awesome
to us.

2429
01:39:17,380 --> 01:39:18,450
Right.
Well,

2430
01:39:18,451 --> 01:39:20,300
so now you're on evolution.
This is a,

2431
01:39:20,450 --> 01:39:22,590
this is what I'm just saying.
This is a recent state.

2432
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:23,633
What we're trying to understand things 
past our immediate area of things that 

2433
01:39:26,461 --> 01:39:27,294
are going to eat us.
So we don't really have the capacity or 

2434
01:39:29,731 --> 01:39:32,760
the need,
or we'd never had the need before to try

2435
01:39:32,761 --> 01:39:35,910
to understand what the fuck 250 million 
miles is,

2436
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:39,090
or 250,000
miles or four light years.

2437
01:39:39,091 --> 01:39:41,250
It's too,
it's too confusing to us.

2438
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:42,293
It's hard for us to grasp.
So when someone starts talking about 

2439
01:39:44,581 --> 01:39:45,414
infinity,
it's impossible to grasp because what 

2440
01:39:47,981 --> 01:39:51,210
his affinity means is there's no end it 
never,

2441
01:39:51,211 --> 01:39:51,781
ever,
ever,

2442
01:39:51,781 --> 01:39:52,291
ever,
ever,

2443
01:39:52,291 --> 01:39:53,124
ever ends.
So everything on this earth that's ever 

2444
01:39:56,461 --> 01:39:58,560
happened,
like in the universe,

2445
01:39:58,590 --> 01:40:03,060
not only is there a cowboy that never 
found that rec center and never got into

2446
01:40:03,061 --> 01:40:03,894
fighting,
but there's infinite varieties of all 

2447
01:40:06,841 --> 01:40:07,674
the different lives of cowboy with every
single different step you took and 

2448
01:40:12,090 --> 01:40:12,923
infinite numbers of each one of those 
individual choices with every single 

2449
01:40:16,711 --> 01:40:18,180
word,
every single phrase,

2450
01:40:18,181 --> 01:40:21,960
every single thought,
all in the exact same order taking place

2451
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:23,520
an infinite number of times.

2452
01:40:23,550 --> 01:40:24,383
I need dmt to understand this.
You have kid that's not even going to 

2453
01:40:26,251 --> 01:40:27,450
work.
I don't understand it.

2454
01:40:27,451 --> 01:40:30,870
I'm saying I don't understand it because
it's impossible to understand.

2455
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:33,650
The universe has no end.
If the universe has,

2456
01:40:33,780 --> 01:40:34,613
this is the,
the main mindblower of the universe 

2457
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:39,960
inside every galaxy.
You look up there,

2458
01:40:39,961 --> 01:40:40,794
there's hundreds of millions gallon 
inside every galaxy is a supermassive 

2459
01:40:44,370 --> 01:40:47,340
black hole.
That's one half of 1% of the mass.

2460
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:48,193
The galaxy scientists believe it is 
entirely possible that you go through 

2461
01:40:52,111 --> 01:40:54,220
that black hole and you hit

2462
01:40:54,370 --> 01:40:55,203
an infinite number of other universes.
That's each one of those is a new 

2463
01:40:59,321 --> 01:41:01,690
universe.
Like every black hall you go into,

2464
01:41:01,700 --> 01:41:03,670
it is a new universe.
And that universe,

2465
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:05,620
there's hundreds of billions of 
galaxies.

2466
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:07,780
Each one has a black hole in the center 
of it.

2467
01:41:07,810 --> 01:41:08,643
Each one of those takes you to another 
universe of hundreds of millions and 

2468
01:41:12,490 --> 01:41:14,680
billions of galaxies,
and each one of them as a black hole.

2469
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:17,470
And it goes on and on and on and on and 
on,

2470
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:21,100
and there's no end.
So this infinite universe that we see is

2471
01:41:21,101 --> 01:41:26,101
one of infinite universes that we can't 
even possibly understand.

2472
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:30,670
There's no way.
There's no end to any of it,

2473
01:41:31,470 --> 01:41:36,040
not.
So from this podcast,

2474
01:41:36,041 --> 01:41:39,160
we're going to go to the Church of 
scientology and learn the truth for $500

2475
01:41:39,161 --> 01:41:43,990
we need to know,
I need to put you to an e meter for only

2476
01:41:43,991 --> 01:41:48,310
$500 and vermilion I'll,
I'll give you the secret.

2477
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:49,540
Hmm,
right?

2478
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:51,490
Yeah.
You have to blow someone.

2479
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:53,210
Oh,
sorry to hear it again.

2480
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:57,490
And I hate your tobacco.
How much worse is blowing a guy and then

2481
01:41:57,500 --> 01:41:58,700
eat and tobacco as well.

2482
01:42:02,230 --> 01:42:04,360
How many light years?
Who's a light here?

2483
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:09,900
What are we talking here?
What was his piss?

2484
01:42:12,461 --> 01:42:15,960
Now they're talking about blowing man.
Pull that plug out.

2485
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:19,790
There's some fat guy with a gun has been
jealousy you the whole time.

2486
01:42:19,860 --> 01:42:21,940
Very upset.
It's ties flopping around.

2487
01:42:21,941 --> 01:42:23,710
He's running down the office right now 
listening to this.

2488
01:42:23,860 --> 01:42:26,230
Have you heard serone but sponsoring 
this guy.

2489
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:27,353
Dammit.
They're talking about sucking dicks and 

2490
01:42:28,661 --> 01:42:29,494
kicking ass in buzzy and kicking ass.
We did talk about that one line where 

2491
01:42:35,321 --> 01:42:35,951
it's like,
wait,

2492
01:42:35,951 --> 01:42:36,641
what?
Wait,

2493
01:42:36,641 --> 01:42:37,474
what?
I saw a dude got that tattooed on his 

2494
01:42:38,711 --> 01:42:42,010
arm sucking Dick and kicking ass.
Yes he did.

2495
01:42:42,011 --> 01:42:44,110
It was on instagram.
You can find it.

2496
01:42:44,111 --> 01:42:46,720
He sent it to Wheeler Walker Wheeler.
Probably put it on his,

2497
01:42:46,721 --> 01:42:47,554
uh,
his instagram wheeler is a different 

2498
01:42:49,181 --> 01:42:50,014
guy.
It knee will use a different guy before 

2499
01:42:53,081 --> 01:42:54,340
he was wheeler.
Yeah.

2500
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:54,580
Yeah.

2501
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:55,990
I know.
I know the real him.

2502
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:58,570
I don't,
I don't understand the real,

2503
01:42:58,571 --> 01:42:59,404
what do you mean the real hand?
See Eating Pussy Sucking Dick and 

2504
01:43:01,691 --> 01:43:06,190
kicking ass and in the American colors,
well,

2505
01:43:06,191 --> 01:43:09,460
it's not that much of a secret so I can 
talk about it.

2506
01:43:09,461 --> 01:43:13,630
But Wheeler Walker Jr is a guy named Ben
Hoffman who's a,

2507
01:43:13,870 --> 01:43:16,480
he's a comedian from Kentucky.
All right.

2508
01:43:16,510 --> 01:43:19,630
He created Wheeler Walker Jr.
Am I supposed to talk about this?

2509
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:20,493
Why not?
It's opts out [inaudible] he knows it 

2510
01:43:22,690 --> 01:43:27,220
his show and he's been,
but he just rides it into the rocks like

2511
01:43:27,221 --> 01:43:30,010
he comes on the podcast is wheeler 
Walker keeps the sunglasses.

2512
01:43:30,011 --> 01:43:32,410
Eyes get the full beard.
But he's also been on the podcast.

2513
01:43:32,411 --> 01:43:35,530
Has Ben Hoffman so when he'd walk or is 
he just talking reckless?

2514
01:43:35,950 --> 01:43:37,750
He's a wild man.
He's just,

2515
01:43:37,780 --> 01:43:38,613
he's saying what he really believes when
it comes to country music because he 

2516
01:43:41,351 --> 01:43:46,351
really is an absolute country music fan.
What does this fuck is this shit,

2517
01:43:46,571 --> 01:43:51,571
man,
when we hear this reboot it,

2518
01:43:53,420 --> 01:43:56,060
instagram is weird like that right here 
it goes.

2519
01:43:56,061 --> 01:43:57,920
Let's hear what he said.
Fuck is this shit man.

2520
01:43:59,060 --> 01:44:02,720
Snapchat without the Dicks dumbs down 
dude.

2521
01:44:03,810 --> 01:44:08,810
And he didn't dicks.
It's funny.

2522
01:44:11,630 --> 01:44:16,630
It's just ridiculous and funny man.
I'm a huge fan of what he's doing.

2523
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:18,740
He's uh,
he's wild Bro.

2524
01:44:18,860 --> 01:44:19,693
Wow.
See like corporate America would have 

2525
01:44:21,651 --> 01:44:23,420
never created that and that's how he 
exists.

2526
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:24,313
He exists because he came up with this 
on his own and the country music world 

2527
01:44:27,051 --> 01:44:27,884
is freaking the fuck out.
Freaking the fuck is this guy guy's 

2528
01:44:29,361 --> 01:44:32,510
selling out arenas.
I mean Wheeler Walker Jr since he's been

2529
01:44:32,511 --> 01:44:33,810
on our podcast.
I was like,

2530
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:36,290
that was just when he was starting to 
catch on.

2531
01:44:36,550 --> 01:44:38,600
Like when,
when he came on the podcast,

2532
01:44:38,601 --> 01:44:40,400
he was already like getting some 
momentum.

2533
01:44:40,401 --> 01:44:41,234
It was just starting to catch on and 
since then the more of these videos 

2534
01:44:44,301 --> 01:44:45,290
could share it online.

2535
01:44:45,290 --> 01:44:48,500
The more people start laughing their 
asses off and they come to his shows are

2536
01:44:48,501 --> 01:44:53,501
fucking huge giant places and he's 
killing it.

2537
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:57,410
You're plugging them huge again.
They didn't know it was coming,

2538
01:44:57,411 --> 01:44:58,430
man.
They didn't know it was coming.

2539
01:44:58,431 --> 01:44:59,264
And you know why they didn't know?
Because they're trying to make a Luke 

2540
01:45:01,220 --> 01:45:02,210
Bryan.
No disrespect Luca,

2541
01:45:02,211 --> 01:45:03,044
who?
You're a great guy.

2542
01:45:03,290 --> 01:45:04,490
Cameron Hanes,
his friend was too.

2543
01:45:05,030 --> 01:45:05,863
I'm not a,
I'm hitting it shouldn't say Luke Bryan 

2544
01:45:07,381 --> 01:45:08,720
because I actually liked some of his 
songs.

2545
01:45:09,050 --> 01:45:10,700
Let me think of a guy who was like,
who's this shitty?

2546
01:45:10,910 --> 01:45:11,743
Like,
here's one that Wheeler Walker always 

2547
01:45:12,681 --> 01:45:14,800
talks about the Florida Georgia line.
Okay.

2548
01:45:15,380 --> 01:45:17,540
I don't know anything about those guys.
Okay.

2549
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:19,520
What do you know you gotta do you know 
them?

2550
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:20,600
I know them.
Okay,

2551
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:22,040
let's just walk this.
Just drop it.

2552
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:23,690
Just drop it.
If you,

2553
01:45:23,691 --> 01:45:26,390
are you friends with those dudes?
I don't know about friends.

2554
01:45:26,391 --> 01:45:27,224
They wouldn't,
they wouldn't call me and wish me happy 

2555
01:45:27,681 --> 01:45:28,514
birthday.
That's you're asking Wheeler Walker 

2556
01:45:29,361 --> 01:45:32,070
calls it rap music for people who are 
scared of black folks.

2557
01:45:32,090 --> 01:45:32,923
Oh Wow.

2558
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:38,900
He was talking about the throwing their 
hands up.

2559
01:45:39,050 --> 01:45:41,450
They seem like fine folks.
They seem like great guys,

2560
01:45:42,170 --> 01:45:46,670
but what he's talking about on stage and
when he's doing well,

2561
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:47,553
wheeler's doing,
it's something that no corporate entity 

2562
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:53,780
or no pr firm would ever allow,
ever allow.

2563
01:45:54,470 --> 01:45:59,470
But look how God damn popular it is 
because people like crazy.

2564
01:46:00,170 --> 01:46:01,003
They like crazy.
Do you know who do you know who a riff 

2565
01:46:04,611 --> 01:46:07,310
Raff is?
No tear wrapper.

2566
01:46:07,370 --> 01:46:08,660
Go ahead,
pull it sounds like a rapper.

2567
01:46:09,170 --> 01:46:10,003
He is a white rapper and he,
his raps are like sitting with Joe 

2568
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:18,470
Drinking Bud fucking bitch is kicking 
ass.

2569
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:21,110
That's like his wrestler.
It's the last seminar.

2570
01:46:21,111 --> 01:46:21,944
But I mean he's,
you talk about it sells out millions 

2571
01:46:24,890 --> 01:46:26,330
guys crazy though.
Crazy.

2572
01:46:26,331 --> 01:46:27,470
He made these,
he made his,

2573
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:28,580
his,
his uh,

2574
01:46:29,090 --> 01:46:31,920
thing off rock are um,
Geez,

2575
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:34,130
the gents on vh one,
I think it was,

2576
01:46:34,310 --> 01:46:35,510
what was his teeth?
Look at him.

2577
01:46:35,511 --> 01:46:36,650
He's,
he's out of control.

2578
01:46:36,770 --> 01:46:38,660
So I did a monster sign.
He sponsored my monster.

2579
01:46:38,661 --> 01:46:39,494
So I did a monster signing with this guy
and he is who was two and a half hours 

2580
01:46:42,771 --> 01:46:45,930
late and it's going to b e t tattooed on
his neck.

2581
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:49,190
TV.
MTV Bet as well.

2582
01:46:49,230 --> 01:46:50,100
Yeah,
he's a,

2583
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:53,410
he was white.
He tell him Kenya,

2584
01:46:53,430 --> 01:46:55,650
Kenya,
he's out of control.

2585
01:46:55,710 --> 01:47:00,490
So this is the saying only does fbt 
right there and just say,

2586
01:47:00,690 --> 01:47:01,770
yeah,
I talked about the same thing.

2587
01:47:01,771 --> 01:47:02,221
He's,
he's,

2588
01:47:02,221 --> 01:47:03,660
he's,
he's outlandish man.

2589
01:47:04,770 --> 01:47:06,450
Told him my Jordans is,
is,

2590
01:47:06,460 --> 01:47:08,730
is one of his songs.
Tip Toeing in my Jordan's.

2591
01:47:08,731 --> 01:47:11,130
Yeah,
people hit,

2592
01:47:11,190 --> 01:47:15,390
they want something outside the norm and
the a good percentage of the people that

2593
01:47:15,391 --> 01:47:19,080
are listening to this right now are 
stuck living some life where you have to

2594
01:47:19,081 --> 01:47:22,590
pretend all day long that you don't 
think certain things.

2595
01:47:22,650 --> 01:47:24,140
I liked the way he's dressed.
He's,

2596
01:47:24,150 --> 01:47:26,130
he's uh,
he's wild man.

2597
01:47:26,220 --> 01:47:28,170
Did you ever Sag your pants like that?
No.

2598
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:29,070
Good for,
you know,

2599
01:47:29,071 --> 01:47:30,480
my Dick is big enough to hold his hands 
up.

2600
01:47:30,481 --> 01:47:33,000
God bless you.
Saggy pants.

2601
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:36,150
It's one of the things that frustrates 
me the most about this youth culture.

2602
01:47:36,390 --> 01:47:38,730
I would have thought that with the UFC 
skinny,

2603
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:42,420
skinny and sagging is a bad combo.

2604
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:44,970
That's a bad combo.
That's confused.

2605
01:47:45,210 --> 01:47:46,710
It is.
If that's confused,

2606
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:47,573
but it's the new trend.
I mean everyone wants to be in the 

2607
01:47:48,691 --> 01:47:49,710
train.
So whatever it is,

2608
01:47:49,711 --> 01:47:51,450
it is,
what the fuck is.

2609
01:47:51,451 --> 01:47:53,310
Why is sagging jeans,
why is it,

2610
01:47:53,311 --> 01:47:55,920
what is that?
It's all comes from prison,

2611
01:47:55,921 --> 01:47:56,754
right?
Cause they didn't give her a men of 

2612
01:47:58,451 --> 01:48:00,210
prison,
so I have no fucking idea.

2613
01:48:00,211 --> 01:48:01,044
I think the idea was that you couldn't 
get a belt because you would choke 

2614
01:48:04,081 --> 01:48:04,914
yourself to death.
You can hang yourself with a belt so 

2615
01:48:06,151 --> 01:48:08,100
that your everyone's pants work sort of 
sagging.

2616
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:11,940
So it made you look like you were some 
sort of a criminal type character if you

2617
01:48:11,941 --> 01:48:15,780
wanted around with no belt on.
Like as if you're pretending that you're

2618
01:48:15,781 --> 01:48:19,440
out there in prison.
What your Jordan's on and pretending.

2619
01:48:19,650 --> 01:48:22,150
I don't know your underwear hanging out.
I'm a,

2620
01:48:22,190 --> 01:48:23,023
I'm a,
I'm a big fan of my jeans where they 

2621
01:48:24,331 --> 01:48:24,780
fit.

2622
01:48:24,780 --> 01:48:25,613
But other gay guys that were in prison 
or God's used to fuck guys in prison 

2623
01:48:28,380 --> 01:48:29,213
that had been interviewed said that that
was how guys would let you know they 

2624
01:48:31,021 --> 01:48:34,020
were ready to be taken.
They'd have their pants halfway down and

2625
01:48:34,021 --> 01:48:36,240
that was,
that was the international sign for take

2626
01:48:36,241 --> 01:48:37,074
the booty.
Did you ever see that dude on like one 

2627
01:48:38,491 --> 01:48:40,800
of those prison shows that called 
himself the booty bandit?

2628
01:48:41,570 --> 01:48:43,020
No.
Ever seen that guy?

2629
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:43,913
Oh my God.
I'm gonna introduce the band world will 

2630
01:48:46,111 --> 01:48:48,000
get pulled from youtube if we play this 
right.

2631
01:48:48,040 --> 01:48:50,220
Well,
yeah,

2632
01:48:50,221 --> 01:48:53,670
most likely that is a world of 
copyrights today.

2633
01:48:53,790 --> 01:48:54,930
Rightly so.
I mean,

2634
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:57,210
they did find the booty bandit.
Anyway,

2635
01:48:57,211 --> 01:49:01,920
this fucking dude was on uh,
one of those shows like tlc or something

2636
01:49:01,921 --> 01:49:04,890
like that to go into prison and he would
talk about all the different guys.

2637
01:49:04,891 --> 01:49:05,670
He fucked.

2638
01:49:05,670 --> 01:49:08,220
And that booty was basically like 
currency.

2639
01:49:08,250 --> 01:49:08,730
Yeah,
that was,

2640
01:49:08,730 --> 01:49:10,050
that's the dude.
You've got to listen to this.

2641
01:49:10,051 --> 01:49:12,120
I don't give a fuck who he is.
Currency.

2642
01:49:12,150 --> 01:49:12,983
Yeah.
You gotta you got this is you got to 

2643
01:49:14,361 --> 01:49:16,020
listen to what this guy talks about.
Give,

2644
01:49:16,100 --> 01:49:17,370
give me some volume.
Young Jamie,

2645
01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:24,780
what's manner we're being invaded by the
government.

2646
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:28,500
Budweiser's hack this show did turn it 
around enough.

2647
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:31,670
They're talking about [inaudible] now 
they're talking about moody is current.

2648
01:49:31,870 --> 01:49:34,110
What time suck a dick downtown booties 
currency.

2649
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:39,720
No sound on this or see if one of the 
other videos play sound weird.

2650
01:49:39,870 --> 01:49:42,720
It's the system pump.
Get on that list.

2651
01:49:42,750 --> 01:49:46,350
Probably because Jamie's been drooling 
over cm punk videos.

2652
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:50,160
We go back to the one you in a zine.
Cm punk was a cm.

2653
01:49:50,161 --> 01:49:52,240
Paul was on the side.
Their suggestion there.

2654
01:49:52,260 --> 01:49:55,300
Joe Rogan on cm punk.
That's hilarious.

2655
01:49:55,750 --> 01:49:57,460
What did you say?
Nothing good.

2656
01:49:57,640 --> 01:49:59,140
Oh really?
Nothing bad.

2657
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:01,710
I don't know anything.
No one knows anything.

2658
01:50:01,930 --> 01:50:03,610
That's the thing.
I mean they want me to say thing.

2659
01:50:03,611 --> 01:50:04,630
Here he is a booty bandit

2660
01:50:08,620 --> 01:50:13,380
speaks on it.
This isn't working.

2661
01:50:15,140 --> 01:50:15,860
Not,

2662
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:18,290
this is not the same video.
Go to the one.

2663
01:50:18,710 --> 01:50:20,510
So we just figured out how to get it to 
talk.

2664
01:50:21,260 --> 01:50:26,260
Here he goes,
you got two things playing.

2665
01:50:26,331 --> 01:50:31,331
Jamie told us about the place and 
importance.

2666
01:50:32,330 --> 01:50:34,550
That booty.
Somebody put a laugh track.

2667
01:50:34,810 --> 01:50:35,381
Oh,
oh.

2668
01:50:35,381 --> 01:50:37,430
What?
They put a laugh track on it.

2669
01:50:40,580 --> 01:50:45,010
Here's the raw version of it.
It doesn't have sound.

2670
01:50:47,170 --> 01:50:48,980
It was just talking about fucking guys 
in prison.

2671
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:54,530
It for currency.
Oh Wow.

2672
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:56,180
Oh,
the cm punk thing.

2673
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:57,960
I didn't say anything bad about him.
We,

2674
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,220
he can't say anything about it.
I'm like,

2675
01:50:59,221 --> 01:51:00,330
do you want me to hype it up?
And like,

2676
01:51:00,490 --> 01:51:02,600
it's very interesting.
He did the right thing.

2677
01:51:02,690 --> 01:51:05,000
He went to a real good camp.
He uh,

2678
01:51:05,020 --> 01:51:07,400
he didn't fight for two whole years.
He'd just been training.

2679
01:51:07,850 --> 01:51:11,470
You would have to apparently smokers 
there.

2680
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:17,160
There's no way you could learn a decade 
of skills in three months.

2681
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:20,360
No.
And that kid he's fighting is good.

2682
01:51:20,530 --> 01:51:21,800
The kids fight,
fighting can scrap.

2683
01:51:21,860 --> 01:51:23,180
I liked the way it took that dude's 
back.

2684
01:51:23,181 --> 01:51:25,250
I liked the way he choked him out and 
showed real good technique.

2685
01:51:25,580 --> 01:51:28,040
He knows how to fight.
Like it's not going to be an easy fight.

2686
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:31,550
No.
I mean in every Samsung it's to fight in

2687
01:51:31,551 --> 01:51:32,690
the UFC.
I'm Phil.

2688
01:51:32,750 --> 01:51:34,010
Phil.
All right.

2689
01:51:34,790 --> 01:51:36,500
Fair enough to his name.
Right.

2690
01:51:36,770 --> 01:51:37,820
He's going to be filled.
Brooks.

2691
01:51:37,821 --> 01:51:38,654
When he fights,
I think I'm pretty sure they're coming 

2692
01:51:39,681 --> 01:51:42,050
out of the punk.
Are they really saying cm punk?

2693
01:51:42,051 --> 01:51:43,490
Why not?
Because I don't know.

2694
01:51:43,491 --> 01:51:47,060
Well they must've made a deal with the 
wwe so they could use brock lesnar.

2695
01:51:47,340 --> 01:51:49,460
She owns everything.
Talk about Illuminati,

2696
01:51:49,640 --> 01:51:51,080
Illuminati,
Illuminati.

2697
01:51:51,081 --> 01:51:54,740
They own your likeness for life.
Is that necessary?

2698
01:51:55,250 --> 01:51:56,083
I don't think so.
I think when I'm 80 I should be able to 

2699
01:51:56,781 --> 01:51:57,614
get that back.

2700
01:52:02,510 --> 01:52:04,620
Is there another sport that owns your 
likeness?

2701
01:52:05,010 --> 01:52:08,150
Tell on your legs or life.
Cm punk.

2702
01:52:08,580 --> 01:52:10,040
Say they got him a zero.
Zero.

2703
01:52:10,041 --> 01:52:12,470
Let's do the only two or no,
but the kids good.

2704
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:15,200
How was he in the UFC?
At and out because just for this fight,

2705
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:18,350
that's how he's in there.
Well that's the wire they get.

2706
01:52:18,351 --> 01:52:19,400
You're right.
You're right.

2707
01:52:19,401 --> 01:52:22,220
It's not fair.
But it is because it doesn't matter.

2708
01:52:22,370 --> 01:52:24,260
It's not like he's taking a fight away 
from somebody.

2709
01:52:24,410 --> 01:52:25,640
No.
We got to see somebody.

2710
01:52:25,641 --> 01:52:26,110
Look,
if,

2711
01:52:26,110 --> 01:52:30,450
if the UFC wants to maximize 85,
one 70.

2712
01:52:31,060 --> 01:52:34,610
And that's just a mistake on who's part.
Somebody wrote it in there.

2713
01:52:34,611 --> 01:52:36,490
They fuck up all the time.
Somebody's,

2714
01:52:36,550 --> 01:52:38,780
you know,
these kids are barely paying attention.

2715
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:42,710
And Sam Hog in the shot does not look 
like a wwe wrestler.

2716
01:52:43,970 --> 01:52:45,230
No.
Well,

2717
01:52:45,350 --> 01:52:46,850
he's natural.
I mean,

2718
01:52:46,851 --> 01:52:47,960
that's part of his,
uh,

2719
01:52:48,020 --> 01:52:49,790
his whole,
yeah,

2720
01:52:50,090 --> 01:52:51,410
well he's always been natural.

2721
01:52:51,590 --> 01:52:53,730
Even if you see him,
wwe,

2722
01:52:53,750 --> 01:52:56,360
he talked about him and I tagged that.
He's a straight edge,

2723
01:52:56,361 --> 01:52:57,920
straight edge.
No booze ever.

2724
01:52:57,921 --> 01:52:59,270
No nothing.
No Pot,

2725
01:52:59,330 --> 01:53:02,660
no nothing.
No steroids has this take vitamins.

2726
01:53:02,690 --> 01:53:05,240
We've had his dog's name is Larry.
We've talked about this.

2727
01:53:05,330 --> 01:53:06,163
Yeah.
Good luck with all that dude cause that 

2728
01:53:09,230 --> 01:53:10,063
live in life sober.
I'm sure you're a great guy to hang 

2729
01:53:12,891 --> 01:53:13,700
around with.
Oh,

2730
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:16,490
I'm sure the stories and the fun that 
come out of unreal.

2731
01:53:16,730 --> 01:53:17,563
Definitely not a control freak.
Definitely not like super weird about 

2732
01:53:21,261 --> 01:53:23,660
like certain subjects.
The fuck out of here.

2733
01:53:23,690 --> 01:53:26,270
Huh?
I'm with you man.

2734
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:26,810
We,
we,

2735
01:53:26,810 --> 01:53:29,740
we've found alcohol and you know,
losing jags for reason.

2736
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:31,180
Hmm.
Yeah.

2737
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:32,233
How dare you pretend you're smarter than
all the people before you that have 

2738
01:53:35,061 --> 01:53:37,490
learned how fun it is to party.
It's the finger pointers,

2739
01:53:37,491 --> 01:53:40,010
the finger point or you get mad at you,
but they're the same ones drinking it in

2740
01:53:40,011 --> 01:53:43,700
their basement by themselves so they 
wish some of them don't.

2741
01:53:43,700 --> 01:53:47,150
Some of them just keep it,
keep it rigid forever and then one they.

2742
01:53:47,270 --> 01:53:48,103
Dot.
Yeah.

2743
01:53:48,350 --> 01:53:49,670
I think there's a lot of people that 
just,

2744
01:53:49,910 --> 01:53:50,743
they cling on to whatever ridiculous 
notions they have of this life and they 

2745
01:53:53,931 --> 01:53:56,720
get some sort of happiness in having 
control.

2746
01:53:56,870 --> 01:53:57,501
You know,
there's certain,

2747
01:53:57,501 --> 01:53:59,360
certain sort of happiness in their 
routine,

2748
01:53:59,630 --> 01:54:01,100
you know,
like,

2749
01:54:01,120 --> 01:54:02,960
uh,
you know some people who only eat,

2750
01:54:03,020 --> 01:54:05,780
I only eat for performance.
I don't really care about the taste.

2751
01:54:06,370 --> 01:54:08,780
What does that fuck off?
Fuck all the way out.

2752
01:54:09,380 --> 01:54:12,020
All the way off.
Like what do you mean you're a Vegan?

2753
01:54:12,190 --> 01:54:14,470
What in the fuck are you talking about?
Oh,

2754
01:54:14,550 --> 01:54:16,940
some people don't want anybody to die.
Olympic,

2755
01:54:17,030 --> 01:54:18,200
um,
power lifter.

2756
01:54:18,310 --> 01:54:19,670
Who's a Vegan?
He's a Vegan.

2757
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:21,050
That's pretty impressed.
I just want well,

2758
01:54:21,110 --> 01:54:22,740
test that motherfucker.
Well,

2759
01:54:22,830 --> 01:54:25,940
well the last two years he's a Vegan.
Oh okay.

2760
01:54:26,030 --> 01:54:27,620
So it's still,
it's still very impressive.

2761
01:54:27,621 --> 01:54:30,530
He's still can compete and he feels are 
there any ever has,

2762
01:54:30,710 --> 01:54:31,521
it's amazing.
No,

2763
01:54:31,521 --> 01:54:32,700
it's not amazing.
It's,

2764
01:54:32,701 --> 01:54:33,534
it's bullshit.
You need fucking medium juicy blood 

2765
01:54:37,491 --> 01:54:39,230
dripping out stake.
That's how I feel.

2766
01:54:39,590 --> 01:54:40,423
But I'm not that dude.
I don't think anybody should tell me 

2767
01:54:42,261 --> 01:54:43,094
that I can't eat meat and I don't think 
I should be able to tell anybody that 

2768
01:54:45,121 --> 01:54:47,720
they have to eat meat.
I think if you're as dude that has it in

2769
01:54:47,721 --> 01:54:50,160
your head that you don't want an animal 
to die cause you,

2770
01:54:50,161 --> 01:54:50,994
you sync up with all these animals and 
you feel like if I can get through this 

2771
01:54:53,241 --> 01:54:55,370
life without an animal dying on my 
behalf,

2772
01:54:55,850 --> 01:54:58,580
that's better in this day and age.
Sure.

2773
01:54:58,790 --> 01:55:02,660
But let's take away everything and say,
you are just out there on your own.

2774
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:06,330
You're going to have to eat.
You're going to have to fucking happy.

2775
01:55:06,370 --> 01:55:08,120
You can only pick so many fucking 
berries.

2776
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:09,033
Oh really?
There's only so many berries that grow 

2777
01:55:09,861 --> 01:55:11,300
seasonally.
It's not enough.

2778
01:55:11,660 --> 01:55:14,330
It's not enough calories.
No,

2779
01:55:15,140 --> 01:55:16,820
we are made.
I mean,

2780
01:55:17,930 --> 01:55:20,810
the vegans talk about gorillas.
They only eat bananas.

2781
01:55:21,140 --> 01:55:24,020
They actually like leaves and shit.
I mean,

2782
01:55:24,021 --> 01:55:25,220
you don't get bananas at the zoo.

2783
01:55:28,190 --> 01:55:30,200
Here's a girl who would have banana in 
the wild.

2784
01:55:30,470 --> 01:55:32,390
Now they're eating like bamboo stalks 
and shit.

2785
01:55:32,410 --> 01:55:33,830
I mean,
regardless,

2786
01:55:33,890 --> 01:55:37,520
we're not,
we're not saying we're not.

2787
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:38,593
We're omnivores.
We are made to kill gorillas and eat 

2788
01:55:40,371 --> 01:55:41,300
them.
No,

2789
01:55:41,301 --> 01:55:43,350
I don't think people,
they definitely grill us.

2790
01:55:43,351 --> 01:55:44,184
Right?
I mean if,

2791
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:45,033
if it was,
if it was eat a bamboo shoot or a 

2792
01:55:46,621 --> 01:55:48,210
fucking gorilla,
I'm taking the gorilla down.

2793
01:55:48,270 --> 01:55:51,390
But I think the grills anyway,
like I know they eat a lot of monkeys.

2794
01:55:51,391 --> 01:55:55,260
Like they call it bushmeat.
Bushmeat is like a real issue in some,

2795
01:55:55,261 --> 01:55:56,094
a endangered species because a,
they'll shoot like chimps and shit like 

2796
01:55:59,251 --> 01:56:00,870
that and they'll eat them.
Yeah.

2797
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:03,300
Yeah.
If it's you not eating,

2798
01:56:03,301 --> 01:56:04,134
are you eating a champ?
You're eating a chimp buddy of mine was 

2799
01:56:05,941 --> 01:56:07,890
in Bolivia for the show meter.
He,

2800
01:56:07,891 --> 01:56:08,341
uh,
he hosts,

2801
01:56:08,341 --> 01:56:09,174
I chose Steven Rinella and they shot a 
monkey and they cooked a monkey and he 

2802
01:56:11,881 --> 01:56:13,200
ate it.
I heard monkey brains.

2803
01:56:13,201 --> 01:56:15,780
Amazing.
I'd do it.

2804
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:17,570
I need to fucking suck.
Die Balls.

2805
01:56:21,060 --> 01:56:26,060
Budweiser's I called Dana white enough,
suck the eyeballs go.

2806
01:56:40,710 --> 01:56:44,660
Oh Shit.
I can make you laugh.

2807
01:56:47,780 --> 01:56:51,320
Oh my God.
This is all pre DMT Hella debt.

2808
01:56:51,410 --> 01:56:53,990
That's hilarious.
When I come back and be a whole new man,

2809
01:56:54,260 --> 01:56:54,591
yeah,
man,

2810
01:56:54,591 --> 01:56:57,280
we have a real hard time eating monkeys.
I'm wouldn't be in there.

2811
01:56:57,830 --> 01:56:59,210
Kind of have a hard time eating 
anything.

2812
01:56:59,450 --> 01:57:00,870
You would need a monkey for sure.
Yeah.

2813
01:57:01,110 --> 01:57:02,990
If you fucking cooked up a monkey right 
now,

2814
01:57:03,020 --> 01:57:04,840
I would eat it.
Okay.

2815
01:57:05,120 --> 01:57:08,360
Oh neat.
Just about anything g primitive man,

2816
01:57:08,361 --> 01:57:09,194
like would you eat it and neanderthal.
So if we're on the movie alive and my 

2817
01:57:13,491 --> 01:57:18,491
plane crashed and I had eat some ass,
sometimes I eat asked for fun.

2818
01:57:19,491 --> 01:57:20,091
Do you know what I mean?
Is,

2819
01:57:20,091 --> 01:57:21,500
I mean it's a different kind of ass,
but yeah,

2820
01:57:21,501 --> 01:57:23,350
I'm going to go in.
I hope you don't eat that.

2821
01:57:23,390 --> 01:57:24,280
That's the wrong you're doing it.

2822
01:57:27,870 --> 01:57:29,770
Are you using a spoon?
No,

2823
01:57:29,820 --> 01:57:30,391
no,
no,

2824
01:57:30,391 --> 01:57:32,670
no.
That movie's not real.

2825
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:38,753
Listen,
if you are a man and you don't need to 

2826
01:57:40,411 --> 01:57:41,244
ask,
there's something wrong with you and 

2827
01:57:41,691 --> 01:57:43,100
your wife.
Yeah,

2828
01:57:43,110 --> 01:57:45,090
someone's got it.
It's going to be a dude who says,

2829
01:57:45,091 --> 01:57:47,910
I really don't give a fuck and he's 
going to come along.

2830
01:57:48,420 --> 01:57:49,980
I would literally eat,
I mean,

2831
01:57:50,370 --> 01:57:51,780
whatever.
Why not?

2832
01:57:51,960 --> 01:57:52,950
Why not?
Why not?

2833
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:54,570
You want to kill her and alive.
Let's eat it.

2834
01:57:54,571 --> 01:57:55,141
Yeah,
she has.

2835
01:57:55,141 --> 01:57:57,660
She's not going to stay alive.
I'm not a Vegan obviously,

2836
01:57:57,661 --> 01:58:01,020
but taking the point of Vegans,
I could see what would they're trying to

2837
01:58:01,021 --> 01:58:04,680
do is they're trying to not contribute 
to any animals dying,

2838
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:08,940
but they're put here to die.
Is that a bad thing to say?

2839
01:58:08,941 --> 01:58:12,660
Is that more I wa I don't mean it like 
that,

2840
01:58:12,661 --> 01:58:16,710
but I mean we have to eat and we are the
top of the food chain.

2841
01:58:16,770 --> 01:58:18,090
We definitely at the top of the food 
chain,

2842
01:58:18,091 --> 01:58:19,920
and there's,
this is where I used to describe it,

2843
01:58:19,950 --> 01:58:20,783
there's a war going on between all the 
animals on this planet and the wars for 

2844
01:58:23,581 --> 01:58:28,230
survival and we are so far ahead of the 
rest of the people competing the war.

2845
01:58:28,350 --> 01:58:29,183
We forgot it to war and we forgot that 
we have these prison colonies in our 

2846
01:58:32,041 --> 01:58:33,510
cities.
We call them zoos.

2847
01:58:34,230 --> 01:58:36,810
That's a fucking prison.
College shows you,

2848
01:58:36,811 --> 01:58:37,644
Oh the,
we have won the battle of these stupid 

2849
01:58:39,631 --> 01:58:42,140
fucking country alligators.
And then job

2850
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:43,073
people like me that go swimming and 
chase sharks and they get eaten and 

2851
01:58:45,431 --> 01:58:46,360
they're like,
ha,

2852
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:50,320
one for the low column.
Has anybody ever gone like getting eaten

2853
01:58:50,321 --> 01:58:52,470
when they were diving?
It's not common.

2854
01:58:52,510 --> 01:58:54,690
It's not very common at all.
Really uncommon right there.

2855
01:58:54,730 --> 01:58:57,070
I think it's maybe one,
I don't know.

2856
01:58:57,100 --> 01:58:57,940
Maybe ever.
Right?

2857
01:58:57,941 --> 01:59:00,190
He's probably an asshole.
Probably cut himself.

2858
01:59:00,640 --> 01:59:01,560
Yeah,
probably a cut.

2859
01:59:01,570 --> 01:59:03,310
Chumming trying to get close to a shark 
like,

2860
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:05,620
oh yeah,
you can do that,

2861
01:59:05,621 --> 01:59:06,490
right?
You can do that.

2862
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:07,211
Yeah,
absolutely.

2863
01:59:07,211 --> 01:59:08,710
I guess I was chum the water a little 
bit.

2864
01:59:08,750 --> 01:59:11,760
Bring them in once you have a lot of 
chum and up,

2865
01:59:12,070 --> 01:59:14,810
some sort of pokey stick.
I don't want that with the work.

2866
01:59:14,811 --> 01:59:15,810
I think.
I think if a,

2867
01:59:15,910 --> 01:59:19,030
once a shark isn't,
I'm eating you mode.

2868
01:59:19,390 --> 01:59:21,310
I think you're getting eaten.
All right.

2869
01:59:21,311 --> 01:59:22,000
Let's play a little game.

2870
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:25,570
I got a little game for you.
If you could pick any animal that let's,

2871
01:59:25,620 --> 01:59:26,453
let's put you in a concrete room.
[inaudible] I don't care the size and 

2872
01:59:29,461 --> 01:59:32,350
you know that I could fuck up naked.
You have nothing.

2873
01:59:32,351 --> 01:59:37,120
You're a squirrel up new funds or with 
clothes you can grow would be here.

2874
01:59:37,121 --> 01:59:38,200
That'd be your,
your animal.

2875
01:59:38,201 --> 01:59:42,430
That'd be the highest you'd got.
Will fuck a squirrel up with confidence.

2876
01:59:42,431 --> 01:59:44,530
Bet The house on me.
Bam.

2877
01:59:44,620 --> 01:59:47,200
Squirrel,
a three pound squirrel.

2878
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:50,620
Cominak three pounds is big.
I'm talking about a regular squirrel.

2879
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:52,620
Okay.
One and a half pound score wouldn't have

2880
01:59:52,690 --> 01:59:54,430
pounds quarrel,
but seriously,

2881
01:59:54,431 --> 01:59:56,890
if you ever seen a one and a half pound 
rat running at you,

2882
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:59,320
it'll scare the fuck out.
He's got a cat would be.

2883
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:00,273
Oh,
for sure.

2884
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:02,920
Fight Crime.
Fighting for sure.

2885
02:00:03,320 --> 02:00:05,780
Yeah,
just buddies and I did I fuck that dog?

2886
02:00:05,790 --> 02:00:06,431
And I'm like,
yeah,

2887
02:00:06,431 --> 02:00:07,270
I don't know man.

2888
02:00:07,270 --> 02:00:09,820
I think if ag dots coming at you in a 
vicious way,

2889
02:00:09,821 --> 02:00:12,190
I don't know if you can,
if you could take that,

2890
02:00:12,191 --> 02:00:14,140
you know,
especially if it's a good size one.

2891
02:00:14,141 --> 02:00:16,960
Like any dog over 70 pounds,
like a German shepherd or something like

2892
02:00:16,961 --> 02:00:19,000
that.
Even the 35 pound pitbull.

2893
02:00:19,210 --> 02:00:20,043
Oh yeah.
Well 35 pound pit bulls would kill a 70 

2894
02:00:23,021 --> 02:00:26,020
pound German shepherd.
That's a tricky one because those dogs,

2895
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:28,140
that's a different sort of movie about a
shark.

2896
02:00:28,150 --> 02:00:28,983
Would it have to be in the water?
I think he would have to be in the 

2897
02:00:30,101 --> 02:00:31,060
water.
It had to be in the water.

2898
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:32,680
No water?
No.

2899
02:00:32,681 --> 02:00:34,410
Like crocodile?
Yeah.

2900
02:00:35,180 --> 02:00:35,860
Not,
no.

2901
02:00:35,860 --> 02:00:38,020
No.
Nine pound crocodile who?

2902
02:00:38,530 --> 02:00:39,940
Nine pound crocodile.
Matt,

2903
02:00:40,030 --> 02:00:42,310
you don't want that.
You didn't know what they want the life,

2904
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:43,473
but I think he was talking,
he would get fucked and pound 

2905
02:00:45,590 --> 02:00:49,000
rattlesnake and I was 10 pound 
rattlesnake.

2906
02:00:49,390 --> 02:00:50,330
Yes,
I need to post.

2907
02:00:51,230 --> 02:00:53,110
I just posted on my instagram.
We were,

2908
02:00:53,111 --> 02:00:55,510
we were,
how long was it about as long as me.

2909
02:00:56,890 --> 02:00:57,970
He was me,
Bro.

2910
02:00:57,971 --> 02:01:00,880
He reminded,
have you guys ever seen the movie rang?

2911
02:01:00,881 --> 02:01:03,280
Go with the rattlesnake that runs the 
town.

2912
02:01:03,490 --> 02:01:04,323
This mother fucker.
This mother motherfucker sat three feet 

2913
02:01:06,011 --> 02:01:06,844
off the Brown and was like moving and 
dancing like literally three feet off 

2914
02:01:10,031 --> 02:01:11,500
the ground.
I've never seen anything like it.

2915
02:01:11,501 --> 02:01:14,620
He was fucking pissed off.
He's the cowboy cerrone of rattlesnakes.

2916
02:01:14,980 --> 02:01:16,780
Yeah.
And even more mad.

2917
02:01:16,781 --> 02:01:18,790
I kept throwing him in the head with a 
little snake catcher thing.

2918
02:01:19,330 --> 02:01:20,163
Oh,
you're trying to catch it with one of 

2919
02:01:20,471 --> 02:01:22,900
those because we got a little hospital.
There he is right there.

2920
02:01:22,930 --> 02:01:23,763
Oh my God.
I broke the rattler so he broke the 

2921
02:01:25,871 --> 02:01:29,800
radler cause when I grabbed his ass,
fuck fucking Anaconda roll up that up.

2922
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:30,430
That,
uh,

2923
02:01:30,430 --> 02:01:33,910
stick trying to get me,
he would like roll crazy shit.

2924
02:01:33,911 --> 02:01:35,770
Look at the size of a man.
He was a big boy.

2925
02:01:35,780 --> 02:01:36,613
He was pissed the fuck off.
So there's a hospital right down the 

2926
02:01:39,261 --> 02:01:40,094
street that you take them and they milk 
them 500 bucks it give you or taking 

2927
02:01:43,930 --> 02:01:45,860
gate 500 bucks.
It's good move.

2928
02:01:45,950 --> 02:01:46,691
Yeah.
So then they,

2929
02:01:46,691 --> 02:01:47,271
they,
you know,

2930
02:01:47,271 --> 02:01:50,150
but we have this probably like my eighth
or ninth one I've cut this year.

2931
02:01:50,310 --> 02:01:52,680
It was crazy a,
so that's how they get to look at.

2932
02:01:52,810 --> 02:01:55,190
I'm staking up.
Wow.

2933
02:01:55,240 --> 02:01:56,820
We'll put them in the toolbox.
Oh yeah.

2934
02:01:56,870 --> 02:01:58,640
So what happens to the rattle and now he
doesn't ever,

2935
02:01:58,850 --> 02:02:00,560
they wrote back every time they,
uh,

2936
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:03,370
ruskin or whatever,
the back,

2937
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:04,213
every one of those levels and each one 
of those little levels is how you quote 

2938
02:02:06,531 --> 02:02:07,520
me.
I don't know.

2939
02:02:07,521 --> 02:02:09,200
I just know the bigger and badder they 
get,

2940
02:02:09,201 --> 02:02:11,540
the more buttons they get like each 
year.

2941
02:02:11,540 --> 02:02:12,650
Right.
They get a new one.

2942
02:02:13,420 --> 02:02:16,400
I wish I had the info for that,
but I just know he was a big bitch.

2943
02:02:16,430 --> 02:02:18,210
That's a,
that's an old rattlesnake man.

2944
02:02:18,260 --> 02:02:20,690
That's a dude has seen some shit.
Shit.

2945
02:02:21,170 --> 02:02:21,771
Yeah.
Uh,

2946
02:02:21,771 --> 02:02:24,590
my dog just got bit the other day right 
in the nose.

2947
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:26,210
Swell up,
and he looked,

2948
02:02:26,211 --> 02:02:27,470
yeah.
Swallow all the way up.

2949
02:02:27,471 --> 02:02:29,870
I thought I was gonna.
I was calling the girl telling her,

2950
02:02:29,871 --> 02:02:31,280
hey man,
I don't have to put this dog down.

2951
02:02:31,281 --> 02:02:32,130
Like,
did you uh,

2952
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:33,290
take it to the vet?
No,

2953
02:02:33,291 --> 02:02:34,820
I'm not paying $1,500
for nothing.

2954
02:02:35,720 --> 02:02:38,090
I got,
I got a three step solution to that.

2955
02:02:38,240 --> 02:02:40,240
Oh Man.
Hey,

2956
02:02:41,210 --> 02:02:42,590
I love my animals.
He lived,

2957
02:02:42,591 --> 02:02:45,380
he shook it off.
You made it right on the nose,

2958
02:02:45,381 --> 02:02:46,214
man.
He took it as face wall for about a 

2959
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:49,560
week.
Went Down Gun.

2960
02:02:49,561 --> 02:02:51,400
It's a pillow.
Senate penicillin.

2961
02:02:51,410 --> 02:02:53,240
Gave him a couple of shots and called it
a day.

2962
02:02:53,480 --> 02:02:57,590
I had a two different dogs.
Got Bit one dog got bit twice.

2963
02:02:58,850 --> 02:02:59,683
I would take him to that.
I had a crazy dog named Francis page 

2964
02:03:01,650 --> 02:03:04,130
$1,500.
And it worked.

2965
02:03:04,220 --> 02:03:05,750
Yeah,
I had to,

2966
02:03:05,900 --> 02:03:06,733
I'm with you.
I see the way your bank account and my 

2967
02:03:07,791 --> 02:03:10,010
bank counter set up.
I don't have that $1,500.

2968
02:03:10,100 --> 02:03:10,933
Put It on a dog bill.
You've got to put that aside and stop 

2969
02:03:13,431 --> 02:03:15,880
buying jet skis now.
No,

2970
02:03:15,890 --> 02:03:17,690
cause I'm too busy living life,
having fun,

2971
02:03:17,691 --> 02:03:18,770
man.
I understand.

2972
02:03:18,771 --> 02:03:21,860
But to me like an animal that I'm taking
care of becomes family.

2973
02:03:21,890 --> 02:03:25,850
His family have to take care of them.
So if it was like my kid,

2974
02:03:26,120 --> 02:03:29,270
I would spend 1500 bucks.
So if it's like my dog,

2975
02:03:29,300 --> 02:03:31,460
I'm still gonna spend that 1500 bucks 
dog.

2976
02:03:31,540 --> 02:03:34,550
Just a dog.
But a dog can make it a dog.

2977
02:03:34,551 --> 02:03:35,570
They make it a little kid.

2978
02:03:35,570 --> 02:03:37,630
It's not going to make it very 
rattlesnake.

2979
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:38,593
We're so sorry.
Could you fucking imagine that we're so 

2980
02:03:40,491 --> 02:03:42,170
weak.
Taking a fucking,

2981
02:03:42,890 --> 02:03:46,190
so I almost got bit by a rattlesnake.
I was out of the lake walking around.

2982
02:03:47,060 --> 02:03:50,240
One struck at my ankle,
barely missed me.

2983
02:03:50,510 --> 02:03:51,343
So went and grabbed my gun out of the 
truck and I said that I shot this 

2984
02:03:55,530 --> 02:03:56,363
motherfucker being,
and instead of kering up and running 

2985
02:03:58,971 --> 02:03:59,804
off,
that fucking snake would just lunge at 

2986
02:04:01,071 --> 02:04:03,860
me.
I shoot it to get the shot it body.

2987
02:04:04,070 --> 02:04:04,903
I just shot everywhere,
everywhere but his head because I'm a 

2988
02:04:06,171 --> 02:04:10,460
terrible fucking shot so well then shoot
him in the head.

2989
02:04:10,461 --> 02:04:11,294
You got to give away love.
So I'm ripping this dude's body apart 

2990
02:04:14,120 --> 02:04:14,953
and he's like Ha.
Somehow still something that the muscle 

2991
02:04:18,650 --> 02:04:21,290
to like stay upright and fucking lash at
me.

2992
02:04:21,470 --> 02:04:24,320
They're like devil dogs man.
For sure.

2993
02:04:24,380 --> 02:04:26,640
We think what they are.
They're like,

2994
02:04:26,690 --> 02:04:28,760
when people talk about Reptilians the 
people,

2995
02:04:28,761 --> 02:04:30,110
what are,
what are they really worried about?

2996
02:04:30,111 --> 02:04:32,150
They're not worried about people turning
into panda bears.

2997
02:04:32,430 --> 02:04:34,030
They're worried about people being 
reptiles.

2998
02:04:34,031 --> 02:04:38,040
So people being completely cold and 
focused on the at hand with no

2999
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:40,020
emotions.
That's what a reptile is,

3000
02:04:40,021 --> 02:04:41,420
man.
That's what people are worried.

3001
02:04:41,421 --> 02:04:42,960
That was sticker back here.
Yeah,

3002
02:04:43,080 --> 02:04:43,913
it's going good.
We're going down so hopefully you have 

3003
02:04:45,271 --> 02:04:46,410
something to worry about it,
man.

3004
02:04:46,440 --> 02:04:47,273
We'll talk about rattlesnakes.
Gophers and it is kind of weird that 

3005
02:04:51,031 --> 02:04:54,750
some animals have poison.
Like some,

3006
02:04:54,810 --> 02:04:55,643
some creatures that live on this planet 
have poison and they could fuck you up 

3007
02:04:59,281 --> 02:05:00,114
and they live amongst us like this 
rattlesnakes all around where we are 

3008
02:05:02,250 --> 02:05:03,083
right here.
You know in the valley you can go out 

3009
02:05:04,891 --> 02:05:05,724
and those hillsides anywhere,
like go down to one 18 and go on those 

3010
02:05:09,241 --> 02:05:12,720
hiking trails.
People find rattlesnakes there all day.

3011
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:16,890
If you have a house and you live 
anywhere in the Los Angeles area,

3012
02:05:16,920 --> 02:05:21,180
it's entirely possible that if you leave
an area undisturbed long in a huff,

3013
02:05:21,420 --> 02:05:22,990
a black widow,
a little nest,

3014
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,710
they're entirely possible.
I've seen,

3015
02:05:25,950 --> 02:05:27,930
I don't know how many black widows in my
life.

3016
02:05:28,650 --> 02:05:31,460
A hundred at least.
Maybe hundreds.

3017
02:05:32,690 --> 02:05:35,310
That's all too.
Last week here in this place.

3018
02:05:35,470 --> 02:05:36,303
Yes.
That fucking studios haunted or we got 

3019
02:05:39,991 --> 02:05:40,980
him.
You got him?

3020
02:05:41,160 --> 02:05:42,300
I wanted to on that,
uh,

3021
02:05:42,301 --> 02:05:44,890
the Seti alien signal thing.
Yeah.

3022
02:05:45,020 --> 02:05:45,853
Did you look into that at all?
Did you read their article that came 

3023
02:05:46,951 --> 02:05:48,510
out?
The the really,

3024
02:05:48,850 --> 02:05:51,580
they're really fun title is all I want 
to get into.

3025
02:05:52,050 --> 02:05:53,140
Okay.
This is why,

3026
02:05:53,350 --> 02:05:55,110
because I want to hope that this act,

3027
02:05:55,660 --> 02:05:57,600
I don't want to like display alien 
signal.

3028
02:05:57,810 --> 02:05:58,643
So when you go into it and they explain 
the likelihood of it being an alien 

3029
02:06:01,711 --> 02:06:03,010
signal,
that's super depressing.

3030
02:06:03,150 --> 02:06:04,350
Yeah.
I know.

3031
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:07,040
This was the thing I wanted to ask you 
about the,

3032
02:06:07,140 --> 02:06:09,750
this a,
it's called a dyson shell.

3033
02:06:09,870 --> 02:06:10,980
What is this?
No,

3034
02:06:11,040 --> 02:06:11,860
they said the,
uh,

3035
02:06:11,860 --> 02:06:12,693
the,
one of the hypothesis of if this was 

3036
02:06:14,251 --> 02:06:17,610
possibly a civilization that it's one of
two types of silver.

3037
02:06:17,611 --> 02:06:18,590
I don't remember the,
it's like a,

3038
02:06:18,630 --> 02:06:22,920
it's a Russian named a car dash of type 
two civilization.

3039
02:06:23,190 --> 02:06:26,100
So this is a nice atmosphere.
This is a massive structure.

3040
02:06:26,101 --> 02:06:30,060
It's three meters thick.
That would encompass the Earth's orbit,

3041
02:06:30,061 --> 02:06:30,894
including the sun and Venus,
harnessing the energy to then shoot out 

3042
02:06:34,171 --> 02:06:37,650
an Omni directional signal,
which is what got,

3043
02:06:37,710 --> 02:06:39,420
which is what they picked up.
Wait a minute.

3044
02:06:39,450 --> 02:06:42,300
What?
So it's three meters thick and it covers

3045
02:06:42,690 --> 02:06:44,850
the whole solar system.

3046
02:06:44,910 --> 02:06:45,743
Yeah.
I'll have the first three levels of it 

3047
02:06:47,491 --> 02:06:49,980
up into earth.
It would have to be that.

3048
02:06:50,010 --> 02:06:54,000
That's what this hypothesis says.
I don't understand the radius of this.

3049
02:06:54,001 --> 02:06:55,030
Uh,
uh,

3050
02:06:55,230 --> 02:06:57,700
in order to make that sort of energy to 
Hump Day yet,

3051
02:06:58,060 --> 02:07:01,410
if it's not this,
it's a type one civilization,

3052
02:07:01,411 --> 02:07:03,900
which is sort of like what we are.
We can harness our stars,

3053
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:05,033
the sound like we can do solar panels 
and then shoot out a directional signal 

3054
02:07:08,430 --> 02:07:10,260
pointed at Earth,
which is how we picked it up.

3055
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:11,233
He,
but isn't it also possible that some 

3056
02:07:12,211 --> 02:07:15,240
sort of a galactic event?
I think that's probably more likely that

3057
02:07:15,241 --> 02:07:17,010
it's just a blip and they don't know 
what the blip is yet.

3058
02:07:17,160 --> 02:07:17,993
I think it's too big.
Donald serone so we went to hold things 

3059
02:07:20,671 --> 02:07:23,520
two bags back to space.
Jamie jumped,

3060
02:07:23,521 --> 02:07:26,730
jumped right back in.
He's been waiting love space.

3061
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:28,830
He loves the space to change too.
I wish I could.

3062
02:07:30,830 --> 02:07:33,200
Nobody can.
I mean even Neil degrasse Tyson,

3063
02:07:33,380 --> 02:07:34,250
he,
Neil degrasse Tyson,

3064
02:07:34,251 --> 02:07:36,370
I real fucking good about the 
presidential

3065
02:07:36,370 --> 02:07:39,220
candidates.
He said there should be an option that's

3066
02:07:39,221 --> 02:07:42,430
called none of the above and that when 
none of the above wins,

3067
02:07:42,490 --> 02:07:44,350
we have to start all over again with new
people.

3068
02:07:45,010 --> 02:07:49,870
That is a very fucking smart option.
So while we're touching on religion,

3069
02:07:49,910 --> 02:07:52,570
I try one of those again where I don't 
swallow it or you're going in again.

3070
02:07:53,140 --> 02:07:56,320
What is your outlook on the,
on the presidential election here?

3071
02:07:57,250 --> 02:07:58,083
Well,
it's good because it shows how fucking 

3072
02:07:59,681 --> 02:08:00,514
stupid this whole job is of having this 
one person who is a part of a two party 

3073
02:08:04,931 --> 02:08:05,764
system,
we have to like be a registered 

3074
02:08:07,151 --> 02:08:07,984
Republican or Democrat to vote in the 
primaries that decide who these people 

3075
02:08:10,991 --> 02:08:13,240
are.
They get to represent this party or that

3076
02:08:13,241 --> 02:08:16,390
party and they get to this position and 
there's only two of them.

3077
02:08:16,420 --> 02:08:17,253
It's preposterous.
It's ridiculous that these are the 

3078
02:08:19,091 --> 02:08:20,260
people we have to choose from.

3079
02:08:20,650 --> 02:08:23,050
Whether you like Donald Trump,
will you like Hillary Clinton?

3080
02:08:23,230 --> 02:08:26,110
You have to realize this point.
This is not the smart way to do it.

3081
02:08:26,111 --> 02:08:30,400
I'm packing it up tight and ball it up 
with your toms before I,

3082
02:08:30,401 --> 02:08:33,490
it's like lawn trimmings.
I just dropped it off inside my mouth.

3083
02:08:35,340 --> 02:08:35,780
Okay.
Ella,

3084
02:08:35,780 --> 02:08:37,960
you're going in for another one.
I'm pumped on it.

3085
02:08:39,440 --> 02:08:40,680
Okay,
I get it now.

3086
02:08:40,740 --> 02:08:42,610
Now you got it.
I got it all packed in.

3087
02:08:42,611 --> 02:08:44,740
There you go.
I hope they'll swallow it.

3088
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:47,170
I hope not.
That's a weird looked on it.

3089
02:08:48,300 --> 02:08:50,050
You're good.
You're doing all right.

3090
02:08:50,260 --> 02:08:52,050
It doesn't taste bad though.
That's what's interesting.

3091
02:08:52,510 --> 02:08:53,890
Wintergreen gum.
Yeah.

3092
02:08:53,891 --> 02:08:54,724
Little like wintergreen gun,
which is girls chewing and my high 

3093
02:08:56,531 --> 02:08:57,490
school.
A lot of girls too.

3094
02:08:58,240 --> 02:08:59,073
Yeah.
Those are girls that should move closer 

3095
02:09:00,071 --> 02:09:04,750
to cities,
sweetie.

3096
02:09:05,380 --> 02:09:07,330
There's other options.
Okay.

3097
02:09:07,331 --> 02:09:09,460
I know you want to stay.
Do you want people to love?

3098
02:09:09,900 --> 02:09:12,280
You tried dmt.
Here you go.

3099
02:09:12,370 --> 02:09:13,203
Well,
there's a lot of these gals out there 

3100
02:09:13,811 --> 02:09:14,644
that a forest,
they go to the outer regions of 

3101
02:09:15,701 --> 02:09:18,250
civilization.
They're forced to behave like pioneers.

3102
02:09:18,970 --> 02:09:20,200
You know,
they've got to go out there.

3103
02:09:20,201 --> 02:09:21,790
They've got to make their own fucking 
houses.

3104
02:09:21,791 --> 02:09:24,290
They've got their own phone that's out 
there,

3105
02:09:24,291 --> 02:09:25,124
dog.
God,

3106
02:09:25,300 --> 02:09:26,950
no gay.
Let's stop that.

3107
02:09:28,360 --> 02:09:31,000
Stop that.
They're out there chewing tobacco.

3108
02:09:31,090 --> 02:09:33,940
Fucking killing shooting dogs.
When they get bit by a rattlesnake,

3109
02:09:33,950 --> 02:09:35,540
you and monkeys,
goddammit.

3110
02:09:35,610 --> 02:09:37,290
He sucking the eyeballs out of a monkey.

3111
02:09:39,730 --> 02:09:44,560
Suck a dick.
Wow.

3112
02:09:44,561 --> 02:09:46,440
We might lose this nurse duty.
This.

3113
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:48,420
It's over.
No podcast is over.

3114
02:09:48,421 --> 02:09:51,700
It's been a good run.
840 episodes almost,

3115
02:09:51,701 --> 02:09:52,534
right?
What does this one is eight 40 over 40 

3116
02:09:54,251 --> 02:09:56,500
we closed it down.
We'd locked down with this one.

3117
02:09:56,501 --> 02:09:58,120
People are like,
I got a life.

3118
02:09:58,150 --> 02:09:59,500
I can't do this.
You can't get,

3119
02:09:59,501 --> 02:10:02,790
listen,
I had you on at work on the radio and it

3120
02:10:02,791 --> 02:10:04,630
had to turn it off.
What happened?

3121
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:06,900
What happened?
Let's go.

3122
02:10:06,910 --> 02:10:09,980
I want to shout out to all the blue 
collar workers out there listening.

3123
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,850
Then shout out,
shout out my people and gentlemen.

3124
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:14,193
Yeah,
I'd be laying hardwood floors had I not 

3125
02:10:16,060 --> 02:10:16,893
pick up by the USA.
Probably are in another universe 

3126
02:10:18,550 --> 02:10:21,070
somewhere out there.
An infinite number of times.

3127
02:10:21,140 --> 02:10:23,500
[inaudible] hard hardwood floors and you
watch it.

3128
02:10:23,501 --> 02:10:28,501
Some other dude fight the same fights 
that you've fought cheering his ass on.

3129
02:10:28,930 --> 02:10:31,660
Maybe maybe mad.
I would probably be mad.

3130
02:10:32,080 --> 02:10:35,360
Pissed off.
I feel like I would be mad.

3131
02:10:35,450 --> 02:10:38,270
You probably would be mad and he took 
the wrong.

3132
02:10:38,450 --> 02:10:40,220
Here's what I think.
I think to you are you,

3133
02:10:40,221 --> 02:10:43,340
who is you right now is a result of a 
lot of these decisions.

3134
02:10:43,550 --> 02:10:47,690
So it'd be really interesting to see who
you would be if you didn't make the same

3135
02:10:47,691 --> 02:10:48,524
decisions.
Like who are you if you decide to never 

3136
02:10:50,571 --> 02:10:52,610
go into that rec room and learn how to 
fight,

3137
02:10:52,640 --> 02:10:55,610
who are you?
If you have a fight and lose,

3138
02:10:55,611 --> 02:10:57,140
you never come back.
You never get better.

3139
02:10:57,170 --> 02:10:58,300
Who are you?
You know?

3140
02:10:58,310 --> 02:10:59,143
I think w who you are right now a lot of
times is decided by a lot of the shit 

3141
02:11:03,201 --> 02:11:04,730
you've already done and how you feel 
about it.

3142
02:11:06,050 --> 02:11:08,570
Who I am.
If I didn't walk into that record,

3143
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:08,900
I don't know.

3144
02:11:08,900 --> 02:11:10,910
My Dad always telling me whenever I'd 
fuck up.

3145
02:11:10,911 --> 02:11:13,850
So I was like the worst kid.
Bad.

3146
02:11:13,950 --> 02:11:15,710
Definitely not the worst kid I heard he 
got killed.

3147
02:11:15,711 --> 02:11:17,840
He stabbed his two year old sister.
I didn't do that.

3148
02:11:17,841 --> 02:11:20,210
That's the worst I shot my sister and 
the head of the slingshot.

3149
02:11:20,380 --> 02:11:21,980
Oops.
Pretty close.

3150
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:24,700
A childish mistake.
Child of a shake.

3151
02:11:24,710 --> 02:11:25,543
So I feel like it was a rough childhood.
He now and I could only have sex on my 

3152
02:11:30,021 --> 02:11:35,021
back cause I could only fuck up sell.
I should be the title of your book.

3153
02:11:36,380 --> 02:11:37,280
Yeah.
And my dad would say,

3154
02:11:37,281 --> 02:11:39,290
if only you could use your powers for 
good instead of evil,

3155
02:11:39,291 --> 02:11:41,240
you would make yourself out to be 
something great.

3156
02:11:41,241 --> 02:11:42,074
You know?
And here I am so well telling people to 

3157
02:11:44,180 --> 02:11:47,340
suck eyeballs out a monkey brains and 
everybody,

3158
02:11:47,370 --> 02:11:48,203
Andy fucking different everybody.
And for someone who is like you to 

3159
02:11:52,311 --> 02:11:53,144
pretend to be like your accountant is 
just as ridiculous as your accountant 

3160
02:11:55,910 --> 02:11:56,780
pretending to be you.

3161
02:11:56,850 --> 02:11:57,683
Right?
Key to this life is find out who you 

3162
02:11:58,911 --> 02:11:59,744
are.
And that is the hardest question to 

3163
02:12:01,401 --> 02:12:03,470
answer because who you are changes every
day.

3164
02:12:04,250 --> 02:12:06,860
It's like you gotta be true to whoever 
you are at the moment.

3165
02:12:06,920 --> 02:12:10,190
Do you believe that who you are is a sum
of the five people you hang out with?

3166
02:12:10,490 --> 02:12:11,540
It helps.
It helps.

3167
02:12:11,541 --> 02:12:13,850
It definitely helps.
We feed off each other for sure.

3168
02:12:14,170 --> 02:12:15,003
You got to surround yourself as much as 
you can with people that care about you 

3169
02:12:18,610 --> 02:12:19,443
and people that are there,
they have the same sort of ambitions 

3170
02:12:23,271 --> 02:12:25,430
that you have in terms of like they have
the same,

3171
02:12:25,460 --> 02:12:27,650
they have work ethic.
They're not lazy,

3172
02:12:27,680 --> 02:12:28,970
they don't fuck up.
They don't,

3173
02:12:29,030 --> 02:12:29,863
they don't ruin their life constantly 
because those people become like energy 

3174
02:12:32,931 --> 02:12:33,830
drains,
right.

3175
02:12:34,010 --> 02:12:34,843
You know,
it's not like you should totally 

3176
02:12:35,361 --> 02:12:37,460
abandoned them,
but you got to be real with them.

3177
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:39,110
You've got to let them know.
You've got to say,

3178
02:12:39,111 --> 02:12:39,944
listen,
this is what's going on and this is how 

3179
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:44,250
everybody's sort of looking at,
well,

3180
02:12:44,290 --> 02:12:46,460
you keep doing this.
Don't do this anymore.

3181
02:12:46,640 --> 02:12:49,160
Why do you keep doing this?
Because you get attention when you do it

3182
02:12:49,460 --> 02:12:52,800
because it's easier than succeeding 
because I,

3183
02:12:53,150 --> 02:12:58,150
I think especially in your line of work,
I think that self sabotage is a primary,

3184
02:12:59,750 --> 02:13:01,370
uh,
escape valve.

3185
02:13:01,510 --> 02:13:05,450
That's who is the leader in the self 
sabotages man.

3186
02:13:05,480 --> 02:13:07,970
I mean,
you go to fighters like old school.

3187
02:13:07,971 --> 02:13:10,520
I mean old school fighters like Roberto 
Duran,

3188
02:13:10,700 --> 02:13:12,080
like Roberto Duran,
right?

3189
02:13:12,110 --> 02:13:12,943
Beet sugar ray Leonard and Duran.
And one of the four horsemen man packs 

3190
02:13:15,171 --> 02:13:16,004
on foods.
So it's eaten like a fucking pig gets 

3191
02:13:18,081 --> 02:13:19,760
too fat,
doesn't train hard.

3192
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:21,830
Says No moss.
And the rematch,

3193
02:13:22,760 --> 02:13:23,593
you know,
Tyson in a lot of ways was a self 

3194
02:13:25,791 --> 02:13:26,720
saboteurs.
Uh,

3195
02:13:26,780 --> 02:13:29,180
Aaron Pryor became a crack addict.
You know,

3196
02:13:29,290 --> 02:13:32,010
I got addicted to cocaine,
her crazy stories about

3197
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:34,710
that.
So on a total fucking side note,

3198
02:13:34,711 --> 02:13:36,450
you want to hear something really cool?
Yes.

3199
02:13:36,480 --> 02:13:37,410
Rick.
Story fight.

3200
02:13:37,680 --> 02:13:38,720
I park at the Rv Park,
right?

3201
02:13:38,721 --> 02:13:41,270
It's where I find my zen.
I get away from the Strip.

3202
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:42,140
My rv park.
Yeah.

3203
02:13:42,141 --> 02:13:43,740
Hang on.
I hang up the RV part.

3204
02:13:43,750 --> 02:13:46,380
Another title of your book.
I go to,

3205
02:13:46,410 --> 02:13:51,360
I go to the lake.
Guess who my mother fucking neighbor was

3206
02:13:51,660 --> 02:13:54,840
who shook nice brother Ron White Ron 
night.

3207
02:13:55,110 --> 02:13:56,940
Oh,
how crazy is that?

3208
02:13:57,120 --> 02:13:57,953
What is that like?
So this guy was big giant black guy 

3209
02:14:00,961 --> 02:14:03,030
comes walking over to me,
first of all his trailers,

3210
02:14:03,270 --> 02:14:04,103
all black with red lights.
And this guy comes over to me and he's 

3211
02:14:07,801 --> 02:14:08,940
like,
hey man,

3212
02:14:10,650 --> 02:14:15,650
what are y'all shit on my porch dead?
Uh,

3213
02:14:16,470 --> 02:14:18,660
no,
no shit on your porch.

3214
02:14:18,750 --> 02:14:19,111
He said,
yeah,

3215
02:14:19,111 --> 02:14:21,330
I think one of your mother fucking dogs 
and Shit on my porch.

3216
02:14:21,870 --> 02:14:23,130
And I said,
Nah,

3217
02:14:23,131 --> 02:14:23,964
man out.

3218
02:14:24,150 --> 02:14:24,983
He's like,
I just want to make sure it was an 

3219
02:14:25,441 --> 02:14:27,210
accident.
And it wasn't anything,

3220
02:14:27,540 --> 02:14:28,500
you know,
like malicious,

3221
02:14:28,501 --> 02:14:30,180
like you guys,
I need to make sure my,

3222
02:14:30,510 --> 02:14:32,910
my,
my area's secure.

3223
02:14:32,911 --> 02:14:34,440
And I was like,
Nah,

3224
02:14:34,441 --> 02:14:35,340
man,
I don't,

3225
02:14:35,630 --> 02:14:36,720
you know,
I don't think so.

3226
02:14:36,750 --> 02:14:40,620
That's kind of funny.
And then I look at him and I look at his

3227
02:14:40,621 --> 02:14:42,120
rig and I'm like,
hey man,

3228
02:14:43,380 --> 02:14:46,650
what do you do?
Because he's in like a $3 million RV,

3229
02:14:46,651 --> 02:14:48,120
right?
3 million.

3230
02:14:48,150 --> 02:14:49,650
Oh yeah,
his [inaudible].

3231
02:14:49,651 --> 02:14:54,651
He's really nice and his extra nice.
So he said,

3232
02:14:54,970 --> 02:14:56,460
oh,
I do a little bit of real estate.

3233
02:14:57,120 --> 02:15:00,690
And I said,
may don't like really what do you do?

3234
02:15:01,020 --> 02:15:01,681
And he's like,
Oh man,

3235
02:15:01,681 --> 02:15:04,610
I do a little bit like music stuff,
you know what I'm saying?

3236
02:15:04,620 --> 02:15:06,270
Um,
death row records.

3237
02:15:06,480 --> 02:15:08,130
And I was like,
Oh shit.

3238
02:15:08,640 --> 02:15:11,600
And then he just goes on talking about 
these again.

3239
02:15:11,610 --> 02:15:13,440
My name is Ron Ron night.
And,

3240
02:15:13,441 --> 02:15:14,250
uh,
you know,

3241
02:15:14,250 --> 02:15:15,350
I was in there with Shugg and I was 
like,

3242
02:15:15,380 --> 02:15:15,941
oh,
she has it.

3243
02:15:15,941 --> 02:15:19,320
Then of course,
like any high schooler would,

3244
02:15:19,321 --> 02:15:22,290
I asked him any questions you could ever
imagine.

3245
02:15:22,750 --> 02:15:24,630
What was it like in the early days of 
Nwa?

3246
02:15:24,690 --> 02:15:27,420
Oh totally.
I was that guy.

3247
02:15:27,480 --> 02:15:29,580
Ask him everything.
What was it like how cool,

3248
02:15:29,730 --> 02:15:30,620
you know,
what was easy?

3249
02:15:30,621 --> 02:15:31,451
He like and he,
you know,

3250
02:15:31,451 --> 02:15:32,284
and he's,
he told me that story that they did the 

3251
02:15:33,720 --> 02:15:35,780
straight a caught,
it was pretty right on man.

3252
02:15:35,790 --> 02:15:38,670
I did a real good job and I asked him 
about a,

3253
02:15:38,671 --> 02:15:41,280
you know,
ice cube and he said that the cube,

3254
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:42,233
he doesn't really go out and party.
He just really do himself and making 

3255
02:15:43,951 --> 02:15:44,784
money.
It's to add any question you could ever 

3256
02:15:46,021 --> 02:15:47,160
think of.
I asked for sure.

3257
02:15:47,161 --> 02:15:48,330
We shot there,
you know,

3258
02:15:48,331 --> 02:15:51,840
for the all the nights leading up to the
fight and he actually stuck around and I

3259
02:15:51,841 --> 02:15:52,621
got his number.
Now we're,

3260
02:15:52,621 --> 02:15:53,450
we're,
we're pals.

3261
02:15:53,450 --> 02:15:55,770
So went from someone shit on his porch.
So we're buds now.

3262
02:15:55,800 --> 02:15:57,480
Was it a dog?
That shit on his porch.

3263
02:15:57,570 --> 02:15:58,890
You've got no idea.
It wasn't me.

3264
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:02,833
Whatever you have to say.
Who should I does porch wasn't me 1 

3265
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:07,410
million hanging out with some shady 
characters.

3266
02:16:11,590 --> 02:16:12,423
Yeah.
You know,

3267
02:16:12,510 --> 02:16:14,970
so dudes make some odd choices,
right?

3268
02:16:14,971 --> 02:16:16,260
Well,
I didn't see it.

3269
02:16:17,530 --> 02:16:18,600
I have no idea.
I was like,

3270
02:16:18,601 --> 02:16:19,434
I don't,
I mean,

3271
02:16:19,590 --> 02:16:20,670
I said,
man,

3272
02:16:20,730 --> 02:16:22,800
that's a rude thing to do to a person.
Right.

3273
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:26,340
Shit on their porch.
That's about as rude as it gets.

3274
02:16:26,970 --> 02:16:27,803
So then we do the fight and was fun.
We have Sunday fun day and I sent that 

3275
02:16:31,181 --> 02:16:32,770
video.
What was that video you sent me?

3276
02:16:33,340 --> 02:16:38,340
That was the park and rec holding me at 
gunpoint.

3277
02:16:38,950 --> 02:16:40,900
Why?
Because they thought,

3278
02:16:42,280 --> 02:16:45,190
let me back the story up.
Let me get everyone plotted in here.

3279
02:16:45,580 --> 02:16:49,360
So I have two labs.
Should I send the video to him so we can

3280
02:16:49,361 --> 02:16:50,930
play it?
Can we play the video?

3281
02:16:50,931 --> 02:16:51,730
I don't know.
I don't,

3282
02:16:51,730 --> 02:16:56,290
I mean one is illegal and what we did 
was legal.

3283
02:16:56,290 --> 02:16:56,771
I mean,
I don't know.

3284
02:16:56,771 --> 02:16:58,270
I don't want to get any of those guys in
trouble.

3285
02:16:58,410 --> 02:16:59,090
All right,
so let's stop.

3286
02:16:59,090 --> 02:17:00,070
Let's not play it.
Okay.

3287
02:17:00,250 --> 02:17:02,290
It's pretty outlandish video though it,
yeah,

3288
02:17:02,380 --> 02:17:04,990
that wasn't me filling me cause I was 
too busy losing my fucking mind.

3289
02:17:04,991 --> 02:17:05,824
Just like my buddy Mikey.
So my dogs were at the marina loading 

3290
02:17:08,801 --> 02:17:11,320
the boat,
another boat rage and isn't of course,

3291
02:17:11,321 --> 02:17:13,060
cause that's what I did.
What his boat rage.

3292
02:17:13,090 --> 02:17:15,580
It's like road rage but in a boat.
Um,

3293
02:17:15,910 --> 02:17:17,590
but I wasn't raging.
My dogs run off.

3294
02:17:17,591 --> 02:17:18,730
There's this too.
There's this guy,

3295
02:17:18,731 --> 02:17:20,950
he has two pit bulls and my run running 
to play with them.

3296
02:17:21,130 --> 02:17:23,110
Well this guys are losing his fucking 
mind with us.

3297
02:17:23,530 --> 02:17:26,740
So it turns out all my guys run over,
they get our dogs.

3298
02:17:26,741 --> 02:17:28,750
There was no like compensation or any 
kind of fight or anything.

3299
02:17:28,751 --> 02:17:29,530
But they grabbed the dogs.

3300
02:17:29,530 --> 02:17:32,220
The guy started talking shit.
And when my buddies like fuck you,

3301
02:17:32,270 --> 02:17:35,350
the guy calls nine one one and tells him
that we didn't know.

3302
02:17:35,351 --> 02:17:36,184
He told him that we had,
we were pulling guns so we pulled the 

3303
02:17:38,951 --> 02:17:41,080
boat out or wiping down,
cleaning it out.

3304
02:17:41,081 --> 02:17:45,490
Well the park and rec comes in hot 
thinking that we have weapons.

3305
02:17:46,270 --> 02:17:47,103
Right.
So this is the wildest she'd have were 

3306
02:17:49,001 --> 02:17:50,350
out there.
They're like,

3307
02:17:50,440 --> 02:17:51,790
put your fucking hands up,
right?

3308
02:17:51,791 --> 02:17:53,170
We're at shirts,
shorts,

3309
02:17:53,171 --> 02:17:54,430
no shorts,
have no weapons.

3310
02:17:54,431 --> 02:17:57,730
Clearly put our hands up and they start 
talking to the Telus,

3311
02:17:57,731 --> 02:17:58,720
turn around,
get on the ground.

3312
02:17:58,730 --> 02:18:00,640
So they tell us is going to ground these
other two rangers,

3313
02:18:00,641 --> 02:18:02,760
pull up hot,
jump out with them.

3314
02:18:02,770 --> 02:18:06,880
Sixteens cock and load and point the 
guns at us like crazy.

3315
02:18:07,390 --> 02:18:10,870
Well at this point I lose my fucking 
mind because there is no reason you need

3316
02:18:10,871 --> 02:18:11,130
a point.

3317
02:18:11,130 --> 02:18:13,390
I loaded them 16 at me like that.
Right.

3318
02:18:13,750 --> 02:18:16,290
And uh,
yeah.

3319
02:18:16,310 --> 02:18:17,143
So we start yelling and screaming and in
mid between the scream to whoever the 

3320
02:18:19,691 --> 02:18:21,520
main ranger is kind of takes charge.
It's like,

3321
02:18:21,521 --> 02:18:23,980
just talk to me.
Don't worry about what they got going on

3322
02:18:23,981 --> 02:18:24,814
over there.
Meanwhile they're pointing [inaudible] 

3323
02:18:26,190 --> 02:18:26,981
right.
So I'm like,

3324
02:18:26,981 --> 02:18:28,780
fuck you motherfucker,
shoot me bitch.

3325
02:18:28,781 --> 02:18:29,614
Like look.
Right.

3326
02:18:31,060 --> 02:18:32,720
That's the difference to you and me.
Right?

3327
02:18:33,010 --> 02:18:35,500
So I start crying.
It's like you fucking coward like you,

3328
02:18:35,520 --> 02:18:36,353
you're going to point a gun on me.
I'm going to tee shirt and shorts like 

3329
02:18:38,141 --> 02:18:39,460
fuck you,
you piece of shit.

3330
02:18:40,030 --> 02:18:41,260
And he's like,
so this is what the,

3331
02:18:41,261 --> 02:18:42,910
I swear to God,
this is what the ranger says,

3332
02:18:43,150 --> 02:18:44,620
look at me.
Focus on me.

3333
02:18:45,220 --> 02:18:46,660
Great fight last night.
Uh,

3334
02:18:46,720 --> 02:18:48,400
I need you guys to focus on me,
right?

3335
02:18:48,401 --> 02:18:49,234
So mid,
mid,

3336
02:18:49,240 --> 02:18:51,430
mid me fucking tell him,
dude,

3337
02:18:51,431 --> 02:18:53,020
I'm gonna fucking rip off his fucking 
throat.

3338
02:18:53,020 --> 02:18:53,853
He's,
I said it's great for a fight last 

3339
02:18:54,700 --> 02:18:56,050
night.
So these guys,

3340
02:18:56,110 --> 02:18:58,120
are they all aware of who you are?
I just,

3341
02:18:58,150 --> 02:19:00,380
the one guy is at this point,
but how does he know his abilities?

3342
02:19:00,381 --> 02:19:03,010
That friends,
this isn't some fucking crazy method,

3343
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:03,611
right?
Like,

3344
02:19:03,611 --> 02:19:05,170
and,
and we're out there having a good time.

3345
02:19:05,171 --> 02:19:10,171
I'm not drinking for once in my life,
so I'm like sober running the boat.

3346
02:19:10,570 --> 02:19:12,190
We're cleaning it at this point,
getting ready to,

3347
02:19:12,191 --> 02:19:14,170
and I explained that my dogs got out of 
this guys.

3348
02:19:14,440 --> 02:19:16,060
And so he says,
well,

3349
02:19:16,061 --> 02:19:18,460
they said you have weapons.
So he's like,

3350
02:19:19,030 --> 02:19:21,220
cowboy,
do you have guns?

3351
02:19:22,270 --> 02:19:25,360
And he true blooded American.
I said,

3352
02:19:25,420 --> 02:19:26,710
full,
of course I have guns.

3353
02:19:27,470 --> 02:19:28,303
Duh.

3354
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:31,670
It's in my truck.
So now the story on the other guy's part

3355
02:19:31,671 --> 02:19:34,040
is looking more realistic.
Right?

3356
02:19:34,400 --> 02:19:35,570
I got Dan,
of course,

3357
02:19:35,571 --> 02:19:36,404
I have a fucking gun in my truck.
So they get the gun and they run the 

3358
02:19:38,301 --> 02:19:39,560
gun,
of course not stolen.

3359
02:19:39,561 --> 02:19:41,540
I give him my concealed carry and I'm 
like,

3360
02:19:41,541 --> 02:19:42,374
dude,
we never,

3361
02:19:42,590 --> 02:19:44,750
we never wielded the gun.
Like it never got pulled out.

3362
02:19:44,751 --> 02:19:47,210
It just,
it just so happens dumb luck that I have

3363
02:19:47,211 --> 02:19:49,340
a gun.
And uh,

3364
02:19:49,940 --> 02:19:51,530
I mean it all worked itself out in the 
end,

3365
02:19:51,531 --> 02:19:54,410
but cops are in a tricky position right 
there because like,

3366
02:19:54,430 --> 02:19:54,800
uh,
in,

3367
02:19:54,800 --> 02:19:55,633
in one way,
like they don't know what the fuck is 

3368
02:19:56,601 --> 02:19:57,590
going on.
They show up.

3369
02:19:57,680 --> 02:19:58,513
Yeah.
Who the hell knows who the hell knows 

3370
02:19:59,511 --> 02:20:01,190
you something you have to show me.
And I didn't know.

3371
02:20:01,191 --> 02:20:04,610
They showed up knowing,
thinking that we had done so of course,

3372
02:20:04,611 --> 02:20:05,690
so I'm losing my fucking mind.

3373
02:20:05,690 --> 02:20:06,141
Like,
hey man,

3374
02:20:06,141 --> 02:20:08,120
all this shit in the news.
Like you can just pull up,

3375
02:20:08,121 --> 02:20:10,430
pull a fucking gun pointing at me saying
you're going to shoot me.

3376
02:20:10,431 --> 02:20:11,264
Like,
so I'm losing my mind and my buddy mike 

3377
02:20:13,250 --> 02:20:15,470
is totally off the fucking radar if they
had like,

3378
02:20:15,471 --> 02:20:18,950
shoot me walking towards these cops.
Oh No.

3379
02:20:18,980 --> 02:20:19,521
Yeah,
it was,

3380
02:20:19,521 --> 02:20:20,610
uh,
that's not good.

3381
02:20:20,930 --> 02:20:21,880
It was wild.
So in,

3382
02:20:21,881 --> 02:20:23,510
in the,
in the grand scheme you think thinking,

3383
02:20:23,760 --> 02:20:24,591
once they told us,
you know,

3384
02:20:24,591 --> 02:20:26,480
the guy called and said you guys pulled 
weapons on them.

3385
02:20:27,230 --> 02:20:29,720
I see where they're coming from,
but it was just fucking outlandish.

3386
02:20:29,721 --> 02:20:32,510
Man worked down though.
That's so common.

3387
02:20:32,511 --> 02:20:35,210
People do that shit all the time.
And so he pulled a gun on him.

3388
02:20:35,540 --> 02:20:37,490
Like what kind of,
and I always tell him the cubs,

3389
02:20:37,491 --> 02:20:39,020
like what kind of,
I mean you can't just do that.

3390
02:20:39,020 --> 02:20:39,980
You can just call the cops and say,
Oh,

3391
02:20:39,981 --> 02:20:40,930
this guy pulled a gun on me.
Little,

3392
02:20:40,940 --> 02:20:43,340
you should get in trouble if you do do 
it,

3393
02:20:43,370 --> 02:20:45,390
it shouldn't be a free pass.
You shouldn't be able to say,

3394
02:20:45,391 --> 02:20:47,330
that guy pulled a gun on me and not go 
to jail.

3395
02:20:47,360 --> 02:20:48,110
Yeah.
It should be the same.

3396
02:20:48,110 --> 02:20:50,560
If I pulled a gun,
get in trouble and he had the got,

3397
02:20:50,561 --> 02:20:51,740
you know,
you shouldn't be able to just say,

3398
02:20:51,770 --> 02:20:52,850
oh,
this guy pulled a gun on me.

3399
02:20:52,970 --> 02:20:54,320
Yeah.
Well it's a conspiracy.

3400
02:20:54,500 --> 02:20:55,333
You're conspiring to tell false 
narratives so that you can get a guard 

3401
02:20:57,551 --> 02:20:58,384
in trouble for something he never did.
The other guy winds up going to jail 

3402
02:21:00,680 --> 02:21:01,513
like you're fucking terrible person when
a guy in jail for something that he 

3403
02:21:03,861 --> 02:21:04,694
absolutely didn't do in the first place.
I mean I was and that's why I it a 

3404
02:21:07,431 --> 02:21:08,840
couple of the dude I just fought last 
night.

3405
02:21:08,840 --> 02:21:09,561
I said,
first of all,

3406
02:21:09,561 --> 02:21:11,120
there's eight,
there's 18 of us on the boat.

3407
02:21:11,510 --> 02:21:12,343
If 18 of us sitting here like you really
think one guy we're going to pull a gun 

3408
02:21:16,081 --> 02:21:16,860
with,
there's 18 of us.

3409
02:21:16,860 --> 02:21:17,693
Like,
like any scenario you can think of in 

3410
02:21:18,711 --> 02:21:20,710
your life,
we'd pull a gun like,

3411
02:21:20,720 --> 02:21:21,920
come on man.
And that's when the cops were like,

3412
02:21:21,950 --> 02:21:22,761
ah,
you have a good point.

3413
02:21:22,761 --> 02:21:23,151
They're like,
yeah,

3414
02:21:23,151 --> 02:21:24,440
what do you,
what are you even talking about?

3415
02:21:24,620 --> 02:21:26,420
Did you get the guy over?
Did they get out?

3416
02:21:26,421 --> 02:21:30,560
They wouldn't even bring it up.
So middle isn't that weird too?

3417
02:21:30,561 --> 02:21:32,960
Like you can't even just like I have 
Amanda man with the person and go,

3418
02:21:32,961 --> 02:21:33,794
what are you doing man?
Well,

3419
02:21:33,860 --> 02:21:34,693
first of all,
and then you can't even have a man to 

3420
02:21:35,671 --> 02:21:38,960
man with the cops because you're under 
punk status right now.

3421
02:21:38,990 --> 02:21:41,690
Of course,
sit down everyone on the fucking curb,

3422
02:21:41,691 --> 02:21:42,471
but it's like,
you know,

3423
02:21:42,471 --> 02:21:46,880
they just like taking her manitee away,
which enrages me even more of course,

3424
02:21:47,330 --> 02:21:48,250
but they have to do it.

3425
02:21:48,260 --> 02:21:50,150
They have to.
I understand from their standpoint,

3426
02:21:50,151 --> 02:21:50,984
you know,
they have to protect themselves because 

3427
02:21:51,831 --> 02:21:53,090
there's a lot of idiots out there,
you know?

3428
02:21:53,091 --> 02:21:54,370
But Yup.
Yeah.

3429
02:21:54,450 --> 02:21:56,090
It's,
it's one of those things where it's,

3430
02:21:56,360 --> 02:21:59,450
there's no winner there.
It's terrible position to be in for both

3431
02:21:59,451 --> 02:22:00,560
parties.
For them.

3432
02:22:00,561 --> 02:22:02,630
They got lied to.
Someone told me you had a gun.

3433
02:22:02,800 --> 02:22:04,430
They'd come in and thinking about their 
kids,

3434
02:22:04,431 --> 02:22:05,510
their wife,
their life,

3435
02:22:05,720 --> 02:22:08,090
their fucking mother,
that no one wants to see them dead.

3436
02:22:08,240 --> 02:22:09,920
They got to you.
There's someone could shoot them.

3437
02:22:09,970 --> 02:22:12,260
This could be who the fuck knows what 
they're coming to.

3438
02:22:12,261 --> 02:22:14,180
They're coming to a gun.
He's got a gun.

3439
02:22:14,690 --> 02:22:17,670
He says Chris Brown shit on the news.
No excuses.

3440
02:22:17,990 --> 02:22:19,610
The cops have surrounded Chris Brown's 
house.

3441
02:22:19,611 --> 02:22:20,444
They won't let him out.
It's been there since three o'clock in 

3442
02:22:21,951 --> 02:22:22,784
the morning.
The cop showed up three o'clock in the 

3443
02:22:23,661 --> 02:22:24,380
morning.

3444
02:22:24,380 --> 02:22:27,480
They're waiting on a warrant.
Some woman says he pulled a gun on him,

3445
02:22:27,690 --> 02:22:31,050
so he's a held up in his mansion.
Helicopters are flying overhead.

3446
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:32,790
I was watching on the news at the gym 
today.

3447
02:22:32,791 --> 02:22:35,190
I was like,
what the fuck did Chris Brown do?

3448
02:22:35,580 --> 02:22:38,970
I don't know if he did anything.
Some woman says he pulled a gun on him,

3449
02:22:39,240 --> 02:22:40,073
so through after that happened he threw 
a Duffel bag out that had weapons and 

3450
02:22:43,741 --> 02:22:45,720
drugs in it apparently then.
Well,

3451
02:22:45,721 --> 02:22:46,554
that's smart.
Yeah.

3452
02:22:46,920 --> 02:22:48,360
Yeah.
Damn.

3453
02:22:48,690 --> 02:22:49,523
Well I for one have never thought Chris 
Brown to be a guy who makes irrational 

3454
02:22:52,590 --> 02:22:55,080
decisions.
I look at that gentleman.

3455
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:56,033
I might,
that's the guy that I come to when I'm 

3456
02:22:57,511 --> 02:23:01,920
confused and I need some guidance and 
Nisa guidance like you already fuck.

3457
02:23:01,921 --> 02:23:03,690
Maybe he should be a manager.
Maybe.

3458
02:23:04,560 --> 02:23:06,840
How old this?
We have many levels of management.

3459
02:23:06,960 --> 02:23:08,250
Okay,
you come to me.

3460
02:23:08,251 --> 02:23:10,850
I go to Chris Brown and then we figured 
work the shit out.

3461
02:23:13,820 --> 02:23:17,700
Two duffle bags with guns.
That's hilarious.

3462
02:23:17,701 --> 02:23:19,890
I swallowed some of that.
You got to spin it out.

3463
02:23:20,130 --> 02:23:21,420
Most of it I got,
Nah,

3464
02:23:21,430 --> 02:23:23,910
that's already swelled.
I got most of it still stuck in there.

3465
02:23:23,911 --> 02:23:25,480
But it's hard to keep it in there.
I'm not,

3466
02:23:25,490 --> 02:23:28,010
I'm a rookie at this.
You're,

3467
02:23:28,150 --> 02:23:31,750
you're a white belt by the shores.
Blue Belt.

3468
02:23:32,260 --> 02:23:34,170
I'll be a stripe.
I was trying to a belt,

3469
02:23:35,190 --> 02:23:36,060
white belt,
blue stripe.

3470
02:23:36,590 --> 02:23:36,961
See,
I,

3471
02:23:36,961 --> 02:23:37,591
I,
there's nothing,

3472
02:23:37,591 --> 02:23:40,290
I have nothing against the armed forces 
or I mean at all.

3473
02:23:40,291 --> 02:23:41,770
You know,
so I just,

3474
02:23:41,800 --> 02:23:42,633
it just,
that was the video I sent to you and 

3475
02:23:43,441 --> 02:23:45,190
you're just fucking outlandish.
You know?

3476
02:23:45,270 --> 02:23:46,860
Crazy.
I recognize,

3477
02:23:46,861 --> 02:23:49,830
um,
that it's a hard position to be a cop.

3478
02:23:50,250 --> 02:23:51,660
Absolutely.
And uh,

3479
02:23:51,750 --> 02:23:54,150
I also suddenly knuckleheads out there.
You never know.

3480
02:23:54,180 --> 02:23:57,480
I just basically,
especially everybody carrying weapons,

3481
02:23:57,481 --> 02:23:58,970
these dentists.
Wow.

3482
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:00,480
And you know what?

3483
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:02,520
Here's the other thing.
Here's where it's tougher cops.

3484
02:24:02,730 --> 02:24:04,320
A lot of cops are second amendment,
uh,

3485
02:24:04,350 --> 02:24:06,100
believers.
So they,

3486
02:24:06,180 --> 02:24:10,950
they support the right of a citizen to,
to hold arms,

3487
02:24:10,951 --> 02:24:11,784
to have guns,
and to use them in a responsible and 

3488
02:24:13,591 --> 02:24:14,910
legal manner.
All right,

3489
02:24:14,911 --> 02:24:17,580
so you want a lot of cops from my theory
on this.

3490
02:24:17,730 --> 02:24:19,020
Well,
it's not really my theory on on,

3491
02:24:19,021 --> 02:24:19,621
on,
on them,

3492
02:24:19,621 --> 02:24:21,930
but it's my theory of how I think they 
think.

3493
02:24:22,290 --> 02:24:24,870
So if I'm taking you,
let's go back to scuba diving lessons.

3494
02:24:24,871 --> 02:24:26,920
You were scuba diving as an example.
If I take you to dive,

3495
02:24:27,030 --> 02:24:28,980
yeah,
go cave diving with me.

3496
02:24:28,981 --> 02:24:29,850
Right?
We're in a cave.

3497
02:24:30,600 --> 02:24:32,550
You run out of air,
right?

3498
02:24:32,740 --> 02:24:35,560
So your only source of life is me,
right?

3499
02:24:35,610 --> 02:24:38,400
So you have to grab my air out of my 
mouth that we now have to share.

3500
02:24:38,401 --> 02:24:40,650
But what if you're sucking too much air 
and using a mine?

3501
02:24:40,650 --> 02:24:44,040
I have to make the decision.
I'm going home to my girlfriend,

3502
02:24:44,640 --> 02:24:45,473
my family.
So I feel like that's the same 

3503
02:24:47,011 --> 02:24:47,844
mentality.
They have to come with any of these 

3504
02:24:48,511 --> 02:24:49,344
situations.
Like they're fucking coming home to 

3505
02:24:51,121 --> 02:24:53,880
their wife and their kids.
So no matter rights you get get,

3506
02:24:53,900 --> 02:24:54,733
get rid of carole.
I'm writing here so I'm leaving at the 

3507
02:24:56,521 --> 02:24:57,211
end of that.
That's what I'm saying.

3508
02:24:57,211 --> 02:24:59,550
At the end of the day,
you already used your ass mother fucker.

3509
02:24:59,551 --> 02:25:00,440
You ain't using it.
Mine,

3510
02:25:00,740 --> 02:25:01,580
I undersell.
I said,

3511
02:25:01,581 --> 02:25:03,390
I feel like they have to come into these
situations is like,

3512
02:25:04,140 --> 02:25:05,820
listen here,
we got called on you,

3513
02:25:05,821 --> 02:25:08,430
you pieces of shit.
I don't know the situation,

3514
02:25:08,431 --> 02:25:11,130
but in my mind I'm going home.
So whatever,

3515
02:25:11,140 --> 02:25:12,380
whatever that means.
Right.

3516
02:25:12,570 --> 02:25:14,580
And I'm not mad at him for that.
I'm not either.

3517
02:25:15,150 --> 02:25:17,970
I understand that.
I understand the survival instinct and I

3518
02:25:17,971 --> 02:25:19,510
understand,
especially if they don't know you,

3519
02:25:19,750 --> 02:25:20,380
you know,
if you're,

3520
02:25:20,380 --> 02:25:23,130
I assume if a scuba dive when someone,
that's someone who's a really close,

3521
02:25:23,360 --> 02:25:24,160
and that'd be a real heart

3522
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:24,993
issue.
It would be.

3523
02:25:25,060 --> 02:25:26,140
That'd be,
that'd be way,

3524
02:25:26,141 --> 02:25:26,921
way,
way harder.

3525
02:25:26,921 --> 02:25:27,754
In fact,
if you show up at some scene and some 

3526
02:25:29,501 --> 02:25:32,830
dude is supposedly assault with a deadly
weapon and you don't know,

3527
02:25:32,831 --> 02:25:35,200
and you're wearing a vest and your guns 
drawn,

3528
02:25:35,260 --> 02:25:36,093
who knows?
Who knows what the fuck's going to go 

3529
02:25:36,791 --> 02:25:40,840
down to talk with this stuff in your 
lip.

3530
02:25:40,870 --> 02:25:42,520
But you do know you're coming home to 
your,

3531
02:25:43,180 --> 02:25:44,790
your wife and your kids.
Yeah.

3532
02:25:44,800 --> 02:25:46,200
A lot of dudes make that decision.
Yeah.

3533
02:25:46,270 --> 02:25:47,103
There's a lot of dudes.
I'm sure though that would be in that 

3534
02:25:48,131 --> 02:25:48,964
scuba diving scenario and say I would 
rather die with my friend then let them 

3535
02:25:51,791 --> 02:25:54,850
die down here.
It's tricky then don't ever come with me

3536
02:25:54,851 --> 02:25:59,590
because I don't ever call me cause I'm 
going home.

3537
02:26:00,360 --> 02:26:02,680
I'm going home.
I know that for sure.

3538
02:26:03,100 --> 02:26:04,090
Yeah.
I have gone home.

3539
02:26:04,091 --> 02:26:05,980
That is the issue with that cave diving 
shit.

3540
02:26:05,980 --> 02:26:06,813
I watched this cave diving thing where 
they were exploring these ancient Mayan 

3541
02:26:10,301 --> 02:26:11,980
sites.
Uh,

3542
02:26:12,160 --> 02:26:12,993
and the only way to get to them,
it was going through these caves and 

3543
02:26:14,921 --> 02:26:17,920
they would go to these caves and find 
all these ancient Mayan ruins,

3544
02:26:18,130 --> 02:26:20,830
but they're going through these case for
like hundreds of yards,

3545
02:26:21,010 --> 02:26:24,520
hundreds of yards in a cave under the 
ocean.

3546
02:26:24,521 --> 02:26:26,620
We breathed out of a fucking mask.
I'm like,

3547
02:26:26,650 --> 02:26:28,330
oh Christ,
I can't.

3548
02:26:28,420 --> 02:26:30,070
I love it.
I fucking love it.

3549
02:26:30,430 --> 02:26:31,263
I know you do.
So I took my bite and my buddies always 

3550
02:26:32,381 --> 02:26:34,630
ask,
they want to go scuba diving with me and

3551
02:26:34,631 --> 02:26:36,660
they want to go k diving.
So I took him up to this.

3552
02:26:36,700 --> 02:26:38,050
We have a,
we have a cave in the mountains.

3553
02:26:38,051 --> 02:26:39,640
So I just took him in the cave.
Of course you do.

3554
02:26:39,670 --> 02:26:41,560
We went in with this,
this is dry.

3555
02:26:41,590 --> 02:26:42,550
We walked in,
right?

3556
02:26:42,551 --> 02:26:43,810
Walk into the cave with lights.

3557
02:26:44,050 --> 02:26:46,480
I made them turn the lights off and find
their way out.

3558
02:26:47,140 --> 02:26:47,471
Like,
all right,

3559
02:26:47,471 --> 02:26:49,480
you want it let,
let's worst case scenario here.

3560
02:26:49,540 --> 02:26:51,320
What the fuck y'all going to do?
And they freak out.

3561
02:26:51,321 --> 02:26:52,630
And every,
everyone I've had to turn the light on,

3562
02:26:52,631 --> 02:26:53,051
you know,
I'm like,

3563
02:26:53,051 --> 02:26:56,080
this cannot happen in the cave diving 
because if we're own to the water and we

3564
02:26:56,081 --> 02:27:00,040
lose our torch or we lose our air 
pandemonium going to fucking break out.

3565
02:27:00,420 --> 02:27:01,810
So I was like,
you guys fail.

3566
02:27:01,811 --> 02:27:03,130
I'm definitely not going down with you 
guys.

3567
02:27:03,131 --> 02:27:03,880
But,
uh,

3568
02:27:03,880 --> 02:27:05,740
just to give them that little touch of 
what it's like,

3569
02:27:05,741 --> 02:27:06,640
it's,
you don't,

3570
02:27:06,850 --> 02:27:07,683
you really don't know who you are as a 
person until you're put in one of those 

3571
02:27:09,461 --> 02:27:12,550
positions.
Like you can talk big and bold until you

3572
02:27:12,730 --> 02:27:13,563
practice [inaudible] been there,
which don't you feel the same way about 

3573
02:27:15,581 --> 02:27:18,180
fighting know apps a fucking little.

3574
02:27:18,180 --> 02:27:19,013
I mean,
like that's one of the weird things 

3575
02:27:19,691 --> 02:27:20,524
about,
um,

3576
02:27:20,650 --> 02:27:22,040
people doing.
Um,

3577
02:27:22,060 --> 02:27:22,893
like a writing articles about fighting.
It's one things I've had a real problem 

3578
02:27:25,781 --> 02:27:26,614
with in the past where I've,
I've even gone overboard like to go 

3579
02:27:28,751 --> 02:27:29,584
after them because I get real angry when
people write like real disrespectful 

3580
02:27:33,311 --> 02:27:35,100
things about,
um,

3581
02:27:35,260 --> 02:27:36,093
about fighters,
about their performances and like 

3582
02:27:38,320 --> 02:27:39,153
unnecessarily insulting and not,
it looks like we all sort of agree that 

3583
02:27:44,681 --> 02:27:46,540
people that put themselves like first 
responders,

3584
02:27:46,541 --> 02:27:48,740
like firefighters,
people put themselves in,

3585
02:27:48,741 --> 02:27:50,170
in the,
the line of,

3586
02:27:50,171 --> 02:27:51,120
of,
of,

3587
02:27:51,130 --> 02:27:52,300
of danger in the,
in the,

3588
02:27:52,390 --> 02:27:55,780
in front of danger for us.
We give them like this,

3589
02:27:55,781 --> 02:27:58,270
uh,
extra love and respect they deserve.

3590
02:27:58,330 --> 02:27:59,163
Sure.
But when people do dangerous shit for 

3591
02:28:01,961 --> 02:28:03,910
our entertainment,
you know,

3592
02:28:03,960 --> 02:28:07,070
um,
a lot of times people feel the need,

3593
02:28:07,090 --> 02:28:07,923
like rightly so.
There's some things that are just 

3594
02:28:08,561 --> 02:28:11,140
fucking ridiculous.
There's some ridiculous shit that people

3595
02:28:11,141 --> 02:28:12,280
do.
You know,

3596
02:28:12,281 --> 02:28:14,140
w w w was like,
park core.

3597
02:28:14,141 --> 02:28:16,270
People are jumping from building to 
building.

3598
02:28:16,271 --> 02:28:16,721
You're like,
Oh,

3599
02:28:16,721 --> 02:28:18,100
fucking Christ.
By the way,

3600
02:28:18,101 --> 02:28:20,320
that guys coming on the podcast at James
Kingston Guy,

3601
02:28:20,770 --> 02:28:21,980
can you hook him up with me because I

3602
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:23,830
would love to do that.
Me and this motherfucker been talking,

3603
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:26,690
he scares the shit out of me.
Just looking at his instagram feed.

3604
02:28:26,691 --> 02:28:27,524
I can't imagine,
imagine talking to him about stories in 

3605
02:28:29,151 --> 02:28:30,890
person,
but um,

3606
02:28:32,030 --> 02:28:34,580
but with fighters I feel like that's 
such a,

3607
02:28:35,120 --> 02:28:40,120
it's a fucking scary and a lot of ways 
it's a noble pursuit because it's so God

3608
02:28:40,180 --> 02:28:41,013
damn,
it's the antithesis of what your 

3609
02:28:43,131 --> 02:28:45,200
instincts tell you to do.
Fight or flight.

3610
02:28:45,260 --> 02:28:46,093
Yeah.
Your instincts are telling you get the 

3611
02:28:47,781 --> 02:28:49,430
fuck out of this.
Don't do this.

3612
02:28:49,431 --> 02:28:51,050
You could get hurt.
This is bad.

3613
02:28:51,051 --> 02:28:53,540
We don't know what's going to happen is 
this is open ended.

3614
02:28:53,541 --> 02:28:57,260
Anything could go wrong and you have to 
prepare for this moment,

3615
02:28:57,261 --> 02:28:58,640
for months.
In fact,

3616
02:28:58,670 --> 02:28:59,503
really for years,
like by the time you get to a point 

3617
02:29:00,951 --> 02:29:01,784
where you're fighting rick story,
you can't just dive in and fight Rick 

3618
02:29:03,950 --> 02:29:04,020
Story.

3619
02:29:04,020 --> 02:29:04,853
No.
You got to fight all these other people 

3620
02:29:05,571 --> 02:29:06,460
along the way.
Yeah.

3621
02:29:06,510 --> 02:29:09,530
You got to build up the ability,
the skills and the,

3622
02:29:09,560 --> 02:29:10,580
you know,
you have,

3623
02:29:10,581 --> 02:29:14,780
there's a confident path in your mind 
that when shit is going down,

3624
02:29:14,781 --> 02:29:15,614
you know how to fight and you know how 
to execute and you were confident that 

3625
02:29:19,461 --> 02:29:22,100
when you get in there and all that 
pressure's on you,

3626
02:29:22,280 --> 02:29:23,210
you can do it.
Why?

3627
02:29:23,211 --> 02:29:25,970
Because you've done it.
So for someone who's on the outside,

3628
02:29:26,660 --> 02:29:29,500
I think it's imperative it really in 
this sport to,

3629
02:29:29,610 --> 02:29:30,443
to,
especially when you consider the fact 

3630
02:29:31,731 --> 02:29:34,520
that it's so devastating.
Like when a fighter loses,

3631
02:29:34,970 --> 02:29:36,590
it can,
it can define their life.

3632
02:29:36,591 --> 02:29:38,360
It's very difficult for them to 
overcome,

3633
02:29:38,500 --> 02:29:39,770
you know,
and are difficult.

3634
02:29:40,130 --> 02:29:42,560
It's the,
the lowest low you could ever feel.

3635
02:29:42,650 --> 02:29:45,410
What is the worst loss you ever had for 
the title?

3636
02:29:45,411 --> 02:29:50,120
When dosantos got me this last time,
I wanted to turn my phone off and hide,

3637
02:29:50,121 --> 02:29:51,290
man,
it's like the worst.

3638
02:29:52,610 --> 02:29:57,610
And then you realize the sun still comes
up and Joe Rogan's still calls me.

3639
02:29:59,060 --> 02:29:59,893
He always like the world doesn't end,
but they love you if you lose or if you 

3640
02:30:04,131 --> 02:30:04,964
win.
And this is no way you can know if 

3641
02:30:05,901 --> 02:30:06,740
you're going to lose,
you're going to win.

3642
02:30:06,741 --> 02:30:08,900
Especially,
you can't say that you're the winning,

3643
02:30:08,950 --> 02:30:11,630
honestly,
just a byproduct of performing wes.

3644
02:30:12,050 --> 02:30:12,883
Right.
Right.

3645
02:30:13,310 --> 02:30:16,070
And you can't say you're the baddest 
motherfucker on earth until you meet the

3646
02:30:16,071 --> 02:30:19,670
baddest motherfucker on earth and 
there's the new new bad one coming right

3647
02:30:19,671 --> 02:30:21,020
behind him.
There's always,

3648
02:30:21,080 --> 02:30:22,490
that's gotta be the weirdest thing.
Right.

3649
02:30:22,491 --> 02:30:23,324
Then nipping at your heels,
how many people would call an out 

3650
02:30:27,471 --> 02:30:28,880
cowboy?
Good Lord.

3651
02:30:29,620 --> 02:30:30,890
I love it.
Yeah,

3652
02:30:31,490 --> 02:30:32,990
but I more popular.
You get right?

3653
02:30:33,250 --> 02:30:34,850
Yeah.
Everyone wants a piece of the pie,

3654
02:30:34,851 --> 02:30:36,800
but do they really?
That's my thing.

3655
02:30:37,660 --> 02:30:39,690
Come get something.
But do they really?

3656
02:30:41,040 --> 02:30:41,873
Are they just big wolf?
And until it comes down to tell Dana 

3657
02:30:44,411 --> 02:30:44,931
calls them like,
hey,

3658
02:30:44,931 --> 02:30:46,460
we heard you wanted to fight.
And they're like,

3659
02:30:46,520 --> 02:30:50,210
oh right,
right.

3660
02:30:50,300 --> 02:30:51,170
There's a few guys,
you know,

3661
02:30:51,171 --> 02:30:52,970
definitely want it.
Like if you call up Matt Brown,

3662
02:30:52,971 --> 02:30:55,610
Matt Brow wants it because a few of 
those guys like,

3663
02:30:55,611 --> 02:30:57,400
and that's one of the reasons why win,
lose or draw.

3664
02:30:57,410 --> 02:30:59,990
Matt Brown always gets massive respect.
Sure.

3665
02:31:00,080 --> 02:31:00,913
You know,
even though he just lost to ellenberger 

3666
02:31:02,390 --> 02:31:04,750
props to ellenberger that was,
it was below the knockout.

3667
02:31:04,760 --> 02:31:05,593
Right.
Crazy powerful and back against the 

3668
02:31:07,671 --> 02:31:09,770
wall.
Lost a bunch of fights in Rome.

3669
02:31:09,980 --> 02:31:12,290
Ellenberger comes back looking like a 
fucking monster.

3670
02:31:12,410 --> 02:31:14,120
He had to reinvent himself.
Yeah.

3671
02:31:14,121 --> 02:31:15,970
And did a lot of training with nick 
curse on too,

3672
02:31:16,030 --> 02:31:17,060
you know,
nick curse on,

3673
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:18,440
um,
down at speed of sport,

3674
02:31:18,530 --> 02:31:20,280
who works with Joe Schilling,

3675
02:31:20,550 --> 02:31:24,130
works with the dose on Joe's.
What a fucking stellar day.

3676
02:31:24,190 --> 02:31:25,023
Love that guy.
Cigarette smoke and beer tote and 

3677
02:31:26,490 --> 02:31:27,410
motherfucker.
Right.

3678
02:31:27,630 --> 02:31:28,463
And just as real as fuck him and I,
once we met and hung out where we're 

3679
02:31:33,571 --> 02:31:34,404
buds man.
I mean,

3680
02:31:34,810 --> 02:31:36,720
uh,
yeah.

3681
02:31:36,730 --> 02:31:38,160
I mean you feel the same way.
Real,

3682
02:31:38,161 --> 02:31:39,690
real son of a bitch.
Right.

3683
02:31:39,691 --> 02:31:41,790
And a great guy,
great guy.

3684
02:31:41,880 --> 02:31:42,713
He is,
he's funny and they bring him out here 

3685
02:31:44,110 --> 02:31:46,800
that always fucking,
he's wild son of a bitch.

3686
02:31:46,801 --> 02:31:49,050
I love it.
While I was fuck cool to hang with.

3687
02:31:49,290 --> 02:31:51,410
And you know what,
he came in after his last loss last.

3688
02:31:51,420 --> 02:31:53,490
That's that guy two times in a row by 
knockout.

3689
02:31:53,491 --> 02:31:55,560
But he was winning the whole fight until
right.

3690
02:31:55,920 --> 02:31:56,753
Fair enough.
Yeah.

3691
02:31:56,820 --> 02:31:57,653
But you know,
he came in with a great attitude about 

3692
02:31:59,731 --> 02:32:00,564
it and I think part of the great 
attitude about was losing to him by 

3693
02:32:02,521 --> 02:32:03,420
knockout before.

3694
02:32:03,480 --> 02:32:04,710
Yeah.
Well it wasn't like,

3695
02:32:04,711 --> 02:32:05,700
uh,
like uh,

3696
02:32:05,701 --> 02:32:08,340
I have resigned myself.
I'm not as good as I thought it was.

3697
02:32:08,370 --> 02:32:08,911
Yeah.
It was,

3698
02:32:08,911 --> 02:32:10,920
hey man,
you fucking lay those chips out.

3699
02:32:10,921 --> 02:32:13,830
And sometimes,
I mean he was playing the most dangerous

3700
02:32:13,831 --> 02:32:14,664
game.
He was playing just empty gas tank and 

3701
02:32:16,981 --> 02:32:20,010
attack and be as aggressive as possible.
And he was winning at it.

3702
02:32:20,040 --> 02:32:22,180
Yeah.
But he got clipped and,

3703
02:32:22,190 --> 02:32:24,170
but he came in with a great attitude 
about man.

3704
02:32:24,990 --> 02:32:25,823
Great attitude.
I don't think very many people 

3705
02:32:26,491 --> 02:32:28,950
appreciate what it takes to go out there
and do that.

3706
02:32:29,070 --> 02:32:30,720
To not play safe,
to just knock him,

3707
02:32:30,900 --> 02:32:33,900
put the gas pedal to the floor.
I don't think you can.

3708
02:32:34,020 --> 02:32:34,853
I don't think I can.
I don't think anybody can unless you've 

3709
02:32:35,881 --> 02:32:37,500
done it.
So you're there watching that.

3710
02:32:37,501 --> 02:32:38,334
I think it has to,
I mean that's one of the easiest thing 

3711
02:32:40,231 --> 02:32:44,220
that someone can do online,
like trolls and people got of them.

3712
02:32:44,730 --> 02:32:48,240
Got To love him in some ways.
I get it.

3713
02:32:48,300 --> 02:32:50,730
If I was 14,
I'd probably be doing the same shit.

3714
02:32:51,870 --> 02:32:54,150
I was 22.
I might've been doing the same shit.

3715
02:32:54,210 --> 02:32:55,890
Damn.
Especially if you're anonymous.

3716
02:32:56,460 --> 02:32:57,151
I'm net.
Yeah,

3717
02:32:57,151 --> 02:32:58,620
with a locked account.
I've never,

3718
02:32:58,621 --> 02:32:59,454
uh,
I've never gotten on someone's account 

3719
02:33:00,301 --> 02:33:03,120
and just talk geranium acts of shit 
talking.

3720
02:33:03,210 --> 02:33:07,080
That's the problem with talking shit.
It's always done by losers.

3721
02:33:07,110 --> 02:33:09,390
And that's something that they don't 
understand.

3722
02:33:09,510 --> 02:33:10,343
And even guys,
there's a lot of guys that talk shit 

3723
02:33:11,821 --> 02:33:13,760
that I've actually won some fights.
Right.

3724
02:33:13,761 --> 02:33:15,510
And then it,
they've actually had some success,

3725
02:33:15,511 --> 02:33:18,540
but they know someone or had,
they're not doing all the right things.

3726
02:33:18,660 --> 02:33:19,410
Yeah.
There,

3727
02:33:19,410 --> 02:33:20,760
there's,
there's some missing things.

3728
02:33:20,940 --> 02:33:23,310
There's diversity and like talking shit 
like the way connor does it,

3729
02:33:23,311 --> 02:33:25,330
like generating fights and,
and,

3730
02:33:25,410 --> 02:33:27,180
and,
but talking shit online.

3731
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,900
Come on on your instagram feed that,
come on.

3732
02:33:31,170 --> 02:33:32,560
That's ridiculous.
I'm with it.

3733
02:33:32,910 --> 02:33:33,743
My next fight.
I have a little bit of a problem with 

3734
02:33:35,641 --> 02:33:36,031
it.
For one.

3735
02:33:36,031 --> 02:33:38,160
I'm a really good friend with him.
Great Guy.

3736
02:33:38,640 --> 02:33:41,730
But my fucking girl,
it's her favorite fighter.

3737
02:33:42,810 --> 02:33:43,820
Second.
Second Phase,

3738
02:33:44,170 --> 02:33:44,540
right?
Yeah.

3739
02:33:44,540 --> 02:33:46,490
Better fucking be right.
Yeah.

3740
02:33:46,530 --> 02:33:49,470
Oh,
a half fucking wild.

3741
02:33:49,471 --> 02:33:51,120
Is that right?
That was pretty wild.

3742
02:33:51,570 --> 02:33:52,403
But I wish I could.
I wish I could handle a situation like 

3743
02:33:54,031 --> 02:33:54,864
that.

3744
02:33:56,830 --> 02:33:57,720
There you go.
Spit it out.

3745
02:33:58,240 --> 02:33:59,073
It was swollen.
I just tell her how many guys have you 

3746
02:34:00,661 --> 02:34:02,940
had a fight that you care about?
Ben Henderson for sure.

3747
02:34:03,180 --> 02:34:04,320
Great Guy.
Great Guy.

3748
02:34:04,460 --> 02:34:07,350
Um,
really that's about it to be honest with

3749
02:34:07,351 --> 02:34:08,730
you.
Yeah.

3750
02:34:08,780 --> 02:34:10,710
I'd like truly care about,
you know,

3751
02:34:10,711 --> 02:34:11,910
I,
I showed you a,

3752
02:34:11,911 --> 02:34:13,350
were you friends with him before the 
first fight?

3753
02:34:14,340 --> 02:34:15,780
Yeah,
just because we grew up like on the ring

3754
02:34:15,781 --> 02:34:17,200
of fire and the circuit together,
you know,

3755
02:34:17,201 --> 02:34:18,790
we knew each other.
Um,

3756
02:34:18,850 --> 02:34:21,550
I don't know about friends,
but we've become friendly.

3757
02:34:21,580 --> 02:34:22,840
Yeah.
We've become great friends.

3758
02:34:22,841 --> 02:34:23,440
You know,
I to give him,

3759
02:34:23,440 --> 02:34:24,910
I gave him fucking tickets to the 
superbowl man.

3760
02:34:24,911 --> 02:34:26,530
That's pretty awesome.
That's pretty good then.

3761
02:34:26,531 --> 02:34:28,540
I'm good.
So thank you.

3762
02:34:28,570 --> 02:34:29,403
Thank you.
Budweiser first fight that was on that 

3763
02:34:30,660 --> 02:34:33,820
Wec p a paper view.
That was a,

3764
02:34:33,821 --> 02:34:35,290
that was the first fighter called of 
viewers.

3765
02:34:36,280 --> 02:34:37,120
Yeah.
Yeah.

3766
02:34:37,390 --> 02:34:38,410
And then,
um,

3767
02:34:38,560 --> 02:34:40,540
then he has a close one eye.
Yeah,

3768
02:34:40,780 --> 02:34:42,370
that's some bitch rubber band,
man,

3769
02:34:42,371 --> 02:34:43,204
man,
I gave Mary submission that could 

3770
02:34:43,751 --> 02:34:46,660
possibly think of who's good.
Second one.

3771
02:34:46,661 --> 02:34:49,210
He just went out and choked me out in 
three seconds.

3772
02:34:49,211 --> 02:34:50,044
But uh,
and then the third one and then third 

3773
02:34:51,711 --> 02:34:54,430
one I won.
A lot of people say I didn't win,

3774
02:34:54,431 --> 02:34:56,680
but a super close,
super close fight,

3775
02:34:56,920 --> 02:34:58,840
real close fight those fights,
man.

3776
02:34:58,841 --> 02:34:59,674
I honestly believe that the scoring 
system is ridiculously inadequate and 

3777
02:35:03,731 --> 02:35:07,960
it's best exam like Joe Lozan versus um,
um,

3778
02:35:08,020 --> 02:35:09,250
uh,
Jim Miller.

3779
02:35:09,570 --> 02:35:11,530
I'll watch that again today.
I was like,

3780
02:35:11,531 --> 02:35:12,910
God damn.
Good luck scoring.

3781
02:35:12,911 --> 02:35:15,550
This is a chaotic fight.
You know,

3782
02:35:15,551 --> 02:35:16,840
it's like,
there's so much going on.

3783
02:35:16,841 --> 02:35:19,690
How much,
how much politics do you think fall into

3784
02:35:20,080 --> 02:35:20,913
the scoring?
How?

3785
02:35:21,370 --> 02:35:22,203
I mean,
you see the judges and they're kind of 

3786
02:35:24,161 --> 02:35:24,880
usually elderly.

3787
02:35:24,880 --> 02:35:26,620
They're not really young,
young guys.

3788
02:35:27,430 --> 02:35:30,670
How much of me?
And I kinda like,

3789
02:35:30,880 --> 02:35:33,850
I kinda liked cowboy.
I like his vibe.

3790
02:35:33,851 --> 02:35:34,684
I like his energy.
I maybe I'm going to tip the scale a 

3791
02:35:36,671 --> 02:35:37,930
little bit.
It's a good question.

3792
02:35:38,050 --> 02:35:40,870
They could on unquestionably be biased.
Right?

3793
02:35:40,900 --> 02:35:42,780
Vans are biased.
I'm biased.

3794
02:35:42,781 --> 02:35:45,010
People are biased so we use definitely 
biased.

3795
02:35:45,130 --> 02:35:45,963
Sometimes I have to watch the fights on 
mute just because sometimes you got to 

3796
02:35:49,001 --> 02:35:51,240
watch the fight on mute and then watch 
it with Joe Rogan.

3797
02:35:51,241 --> 02:35:51,821
You're like,
wow.

3798
02:35:51,821 --> 02:35:52,654
He swayed to tick.
He tipped the scale on that one for 

3799
02:35:54,421 --> 02:35:55,690
sure.
I tried not to.

3800
02:35:55,880 --> 02:35:57,670
I try not to.
I told you before,

3801
02:35:57,671 --> 02:35:58,990
man,
I'm bias towards you though.

3802
02:35:58,991 --> 02:36:00,860
This is a problem.
Appreciate it.

3803
02:36:01,090 --> 02:36:02,940
I'm a legitimate fan,
you know,

3804
02:36:02,950 --> 02:36:05,230
and I try to be as objective as 
possible,

3805
02:36:05,231 --> 02:36:06,820
but the things are happening in a fight.

3806
02:36:06,820 --> 02:36:10,840
You get excited.
I think I do my best to do it justice,

3807
02:36:10,841 --> 02:36:12,730
but I'm not scoring it right.
You know,

3808
02:36:12,731 --> 02:36:16,180
I'm trying to be entertaining,
but being a commentator is a weird job.

3809
02:36:16,810 --> 02:36:18,610
How much are you going to do it?
I don't know.

3810
02:36:18,790 --> 02:36:22,360
I'm doing it less and I like it more 
because I'm doing it less.

3811
02:36:22,390 --> 02:36:24,010
So.
How do you pick the ones you want to do?

3812
02:36:24,290 --> 02:36:26,020
Paper.
Paper view one's in North America.

3813
02:36:26,290 --> 02:36:27,670
No more traveling.
No more traveling.

3814
02:36:27,671 --> 02:36:30,700
No more Australia.
I need to get on paper view.

3815
02:36:31,270 --> 02:36:32,340
Big chose.
Yeah.

3816
02:36:32,500 --> 02:36:34,580
Vegas baby.
Kinda easy.

3817
02:36:34,600 --> 02:36:36,820
That's a 40 minute flight from me.
I Love Vegas.

3818
02:36:36,880 --> 02:36:37,713
Everything's open.
That's the worst thing about traveling 

3819
02:36:38,711 --> 02:36:39,281
and fighting.
Right?

3820
02:36:39,281 --> 02:36:40,114
You fight,
the first thing you want to do is eat 

3821
02:36:41,170 --> 02:36:43,750
right and they 11 o'clock everything's 
closed.

3822
02:36:43,850 --> 02:36:46,990
Stake Vegas.
Shit.

3823
02:36:47,020 --> 02:36:48,820
11 o'clock come on.
Yeah,

3824
02:36:48,821 --> 02:36:50,290
come on in.
We got to fall.

3825
02:36:50,291 --> 02:36:51,730
Glob.
We've got rib eyes.

3826
02:36:52,090 --> 02:36:53,700
Fuck while they're talking about fuck 
why?

3827
02:36:53,701 --> 02:36:54,730
But luck.
Really.

3828
02:36:54,880 --> 02:36:55,960
Gum Sliver.
Love it.

3829
02:36:56,020 --> 02:36:57,040
Love it.
Yuck.

3830
02:36:57,210 --> 02:36:58,300
So you know what I mean?
It's good for you.

3831
02:36:58,360 --> 02:36:59,193
No it neither one of those.
It's not good for you and it's not not 

3832
02:37:01,631 --> 02:37:02,770
good tasting.
It's good.

3833
02:37:02,771 --> 02:37:03,850
It's delicious.
Well,

3834
02:37:03,851 --> 02:37:05,560
I don't know if it's good for you.
You probably know more than me,

3835
02:37:05,561 --> 02:37:06,370
but I just,
it can't,

3836
02:37:06,370 --> 02:37:11,230
something that tastes way better than 
the sub them oily like a giant booger.

3837
02:37:11,530 --> 02:37:13,030
I love it.
I love it.

3838
02:37:13,060 --> 02:37:15,800
It's delicious.
People mad that you,

3839
02:37:15,830 --> 02:37:16,040
that

3840
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:19,620
you have to force feed to duck.
You have to force feed the goose to make

3841
02:37:19,621 --> 02:37:20,181
um,
uh,

3842
02:37:20,181 --> 02:37:22,250
have their liver.
The liver inflates.

3843
02:37:22,280 --> 02:37:27,080
It gets larger when they get forced fed.
But I mean why you still kill him?

3844
02:37:27,230 --> 02:37:28,063
It's so bizarre.
Like it's okay to kill them and eat 

3845
02:37:29,241 --> 02:37:30,074
them.
But for a while in California it was 

3846
02:37:31,011 --> 02:37:33,170
illegal to force feed them.
I fed it,

3847
02:37:33,470 --> 02:37:34,303
forced fed a couple of girls goose.
That's not the same budweiser bad guys 

3848
02:37:42,201 --> 02:37:47,201
running down the hallway.
He's forced feeding girls is goose.

3849
02:37:49,360 --> 02:37:51,500
Goddammit.
People get mad.

3850
02:37:51,710 --> 02:37:53,720
Oh Man.
Feed at goose.

3851
02:37:53,780 --> 02:37:55,310
I didn't know that was the,
here's the thing,

3852
02:37:55,311 --> 02:37:57,080
Anthony Bordain told me that I looked it
up.

3853
02:37:57,320 --> 02:38:00,170
He said they actually gravitate towards 
the feeding pipe.

3854
02:38:00,171 --> 02:38:02,660
Like our idea of what a force feeding is
like,

3855
02:38:02,661 --> 02:38:05,330
we think it'd be terrible to have 
someone dump food down your throat.

3856
02:38:05,600 --> 02:38:07,100
Their throats aren't like our throats.

3857
02:38:07,100 --> 02:38:08,690
Like they,
they like it doesn't,

3858
02:38:09,050 --> 02:38:13,280
it doesn't bother them in a way.
Like there's some is shit that people do

3859
02:38:13,281 --> 02:38:16,610
with factory farming,
like making pigs live side by side,

3860
02:38:16,611 --> 02:38:20,360
crammed in these cages and cows and 
living in their own shit.

3861
02:38:20,390 --> 02:38:22,370
But we don't talk about it because we 
love Bacon.

3862
02:38:22,820 --> 02:38:24,980
Bacon is good and it's hard to get it 
from a wild pig.

3863
02:38:25,070 --> 02:38:26,780
That's the thing about if you love 
Bacon,

3864
02:38:27,110 --> 02:38:27,943
you love domesticated pigs folks.
The ones who feed the or to and eat the 

3865
02:38:32,201 --> 02:38:33,034
bait,
fatten them up.

3866
02:38:33,290 --> 02:38:34,123
Yeah,
because if you,

3867
02:38:34,360 --> 02:38:35,091
you know,
feral,

3868
02:38:35,091 --> 02:38:36,170
beefy,
giant,

3869
02:38:36,171 --> 02:38:37,190
muscular pig.
No,

3870
02:38:37,191 --> 02:38:39,740
it does not taste like,
well you can get bacon out of it,

3871
02:38:39,741 --> 02:38:42,290
but the bacon,
like you see a wild hogs bacon,

3872
02:38:42,460 --> 02:38:46,400
which is bacon is like a,
it's like what's attached to the ribs.

3873
02:38:46,401 --> 02:38:49,400
It's like the lower rib area on a wild 
hog.

3874
02:38:49,400 --> 02:38:52,640
That shit is like a quarter of an inch 
thick for all of it.

3875
02:38:52,700 --> 02:38:53,533
And then if you like,
if you get a side of bacon on a fat 

3876
02:38:56,571 --> 02:38:57,404
domestic picked out as a fat fucking 
slab because he's lays around cut a 

3877
02:39:01,011 --> 02:39:03,950
feral pig is moving on the move every 
day.

3878
02:39:03,951 --> 02:39:05,210
Hustling,
hustling.

3879
02:39:05,300 --> 02:39:06,410
Yeah.
You remember that old,

3880
02:39:06,490 --> 02:39:08,720
the pork.
It's the other white meat.

3881
02:39:08,780 --> 02:39:09,810
Remember that?
Yeah.

3882
02:39:09,860 --> 02:39:12,170
This is not with wild pigs.
There's nothing white about it.

3883
02:39:12,320 --> 02:39:13,850
It's dark.
It's dark.

3884
02:39:13,851 --> 02:39:15,710
Like a deer hunter.
Yeah.

3885
02:39:15,711 --> 02:39:18,170
I love picking why?
You know what I like about hunting pigs?

3886
02:39:18,171 --> 02:39:19,640
Nobody gets mad at you.
You're,

3887
02:39:19,700 --> 02:39:22,940
they're like co with a,
with a machine gun out of a helicopter.

3888
02:39:22,941 --> 02:39:25,460
If you wish,
please help me.

3889
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:29,810
They don't give a pig slow him down.
He's just fuck they fucking,

3890
02:39:29,811 --> 02:39:32,960
they make babies three times a year.
Why is that?

3891
02:39:32,961 --> 02:39:33,794
Like you,
you post pictures of machine gunning 

3892
02:39:35,031 --> 02:39:37,550
pigs down,
but if you machine gun a herd of elk,

3893
02:39:37,551 --> 02:39:39,500
all buddy,
man,

3894
02:39:39,620 --> 02:39:39,920
right?

3895
02:39:39,920 --> 02:39:40,770
I mean,
yeah.

3896
02:39:41,010 --> 02:39:45,080
Well Steve Rinella calls them 
charismatic megafauna.

3897
02:39:45,290 --> 02:39:46,123
There's like this chain of charismatic 
large animals and the biggest one is 

3898
02:39:49,971 --> 02:39:51,580
bears.
Like if you kill a bear,

3899
02:39:51,600 --> 02:39:54,800
people will be so fucking mad at you.
But if you kill a pig,

3900
02:39:55,100 --> 02:39:57,260
it is a few people that are extremists.
They'd be like,

3901
02:39:57,261 --> 02:39:58,860
any loss of life is horrible.
Sure.

3902
02:39:58,970 --> 02:40:02,240
But those pigs,
they destroy ground nesting birds.

3903
02:40:02,241 --> 02:40:05,210
They just decimate populations of them.
They kill Fonz.

3904
02:40:05,360 --> 02:40:07,160
There's a crazy picture.
Like someone was like,

3905
02:40:07,180 --> 02:40:11,510
did deers like what do you see that man,
they don't kill deer bull shit.

3906
02:40:11,930 --> 02:40:12,763
Wild hogs kill everything.
This is a crazy picture of a wild boar 

3907
02:40:15,691 --> 02:40:19,080
running off of the font and its mouth 
and its a,

3908
02:40:19,140 --> 02:40:21,450
it's a sweet picture.
Home.

3909
02:40:21,990 --> 02:40:23,160
Domestic.
Yeah.

3910
02:40:23,460 --> 02:40:26,550
And they eat my chickens and roosters 
all the time.

3911
02:40:26,580 --> 02:40:27,413
Oh yeah.
If you get fucking within a pig bite 

3912
02:40:30,091 --> 02:40:34,170
away like you to see the fucking 
chickens eating the feed and the fucking

3913
02:40:34,171 --> 02:40:35,730
piggle just grab it by the head and eat 
it.

3914
02:40:35,730 --> 02:40:36,480
Yeah,
look at that.

3915
02:40:36,480 --> 02:40:37,313
Yeah.
That's what my chickens eat in the CAF 

3916
02:40:38,611 --> 02:40:39,710
all the time.
They eat everything.

3917
02:40:40,020 --> 02:40:43,320
People don't understand that as a 
fucking eating machine.

3918
02:40:43,350 --> 02:40:46,330
That sort of pig is,
they give zero fucks.

3919
02:40:46,430 --> 02:40:48,780
Let's talk about how,
so look,

3920
02:40:48,990 --> 02:40:49,823
that amazing welder be eating a cheetah.
That's a wild boar eating a cheetah and 

3921
02:40:55,951 --> 02:40:58,520
then puts out you feed a pig.
Anything in outcomes.

3922
02:40:58,530 --> 02:41:00,150
Bacon.
How great is that?

3923
02:41:00,210 --> 02:41:01,043
Well you have to get them domesticated 
and they change everything about 

3924
02:41:03,721 --> 02:41:05,610
themselves.
They don't become this sketchy fucking,

3925
02:41:05,730 --> 02:41:07,380
there's one running off of the or in his
mouth.

3926
02:41:07,381 --> 02:41:08,214
Look at that shit.
We're on this African plains wielder 

3927
02:41:10,540 --> 02:41:12,030
bees here.
Uh,

3928
02:41:12,090 --> 02:41:15,150
is that I feel like,
hmm.

3929
02:41:15,210 --> 02:41:17,550
I think that's a pig.
A feral pig.

3930
02:41:17,551 --> 02:41:18,180
That's,
that's,

3931
02:41:18,180 --> 02:41:20,310
I think that's to pick it might be 
Australia.

3932
02:41:20,520 --> 02:41:22,290
Visit the page and see what the fuck 
that is.

3933
02:41:22,800 --> 02:41:23,440
Yeah.
I,

3934
02:41:23,440 --> 02:41:25,230
that's how I think.
That's just a wild boar.

3935
02:41:25,260 --> 02:41:26,093
Right.
See that's the weird thing about 

3936
02:41:27,241 --> 02:41:30,170
domestic pigs is in Louisiana.
Yeah.

3937
02:41:30,230 --> 02:41:31,290
Yeah.
That's just a wild boar.

3938
02:41:31,650 --> 02:41:33,990
Wild boar is they get that real long 
snout,

3939
02:41:34,020 --> 02:41:37,420
but they don't have the same kind of 
tusks that a little dose do.

3940
02:41:37,830 --> 02:41:38,663
Well,
not a to bees will to beast is actually 

3941
02:41:39,511 --> 02:41:41,430
like a,
a an antelope type species.

3942
02:41:41,550 --> 02:41:42,383
Right.
We were thinking there's a wart hog 

3943
02:41:43,530 --> 02:41:45,870
warhol,
the ones that have that swords that come

3944
02:41:45,871 --> 02:41:47,430
out of their face.
Those was a giant,

3945
02:41:47,431 --> 02:41:49,560
huge tusks.
That's a little bit,

3946
02:41:49,830 --> 02:41:51,990
that's like the more extreme version of 
this,

3947
02:41:52,200 --> 02:41:54,720
but those things that we have over here,
that's a warhol.

3948
02:41:54,790 --> 02:41:56,910
There it is.
We'll get that motherfucker.

3949
02:41:57,240 --> 02:41:58,770
Jesus Christ.
A hair look.

3950
02:41:58,771 --> 02:42:00,180
Get his Mohawk.
Yeah.

3951
02:42:00,181 --> 02:42:01,014
My friend Remy went over to Africa and 
shot one and he said it tasted just the 

3952
02:42:03,630 --> 02:42:03,930
eyes.

3953
02:42:03,930 --> 02:42:04,763
What are the horns knows something that 
keeps up from biting and size fucking 

3954
02:42:08,101 --> 02:42:09,570
mean.
They called me and that is,

3955
02:42:09,690 --> 02:42:10,523
it's like gag reflex.
So when someone tries to eat your eye 

3956
02:42:12,540 --> 02:42:13,373
that that goes in,
that Dick goes right in their mouth and 

3957
02:42:16,921 --> 02:42:20,310
they puke up your eyeball.
That's a fucking hard ass animal.

3958
02:42:20,610 --> 02:42:22,260
Pretty vicious right there.
Fuck yeah.

3959
02:42:22,261 --> 02:42:24,660
It's vicious.
That's a hard ass animal.

3960
02:42:24,810 --> 02:42:27,210
You don't grow those kinds of tufts on 
your face cause they're pretty,

3961
02:42:27,420 --> 02:42:29,370
they attract females.
That's a,

3962
02:42:29,371 --> 02:42:30,204
that's an animal that knows it has a 
short window to eat as much shit as it 

3963
02:42:33,661 --> 02:42:38,220
can and hope nothing.
Know that pigs have spiraled dicks.

3964
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:40,530
Yeah.
Type about getting screwed.

3965
02:42:40,531 --> 02:42:42,360
That's where it comes from.
Is that what it comes from?

3966
02:42:42,390 --> 02:42:43,560
Yeah,
they have.

3967
02:42:43,950 --> 02:42:46,290
They like,
they have spiraled it.

3968
02:42:46,291 --> 02:42:47,720
So the ducks,
we would,

3969
02:42:47,740 --> 02:42:48,573
we reviewed that in the podcast and 
apparently I'd say the ducks at three 

3970
02:42:50,401 --> 02:42:52,200
foot long Dicks,
I was wrong.

3971
02:42:52,740 --> 02:42:56,550
This Andrea's Antonopoulos the point of 
bird that's only three feet long,

3972
02:42:56,551 --> 02:42:59,040
have a three foot.
They have like 13 inch Dick's though.

3973
02:42:59,280 --> 02:43:00,240
Seriously?
Yeah.

3974
02:43:00,241 --> 02:43:01,610
Oh,
they have giant crazy dicks.

3975
02:43:01,630 --> 02:43:02,221
Dot.
Look at it.

3976
02:43:02,221 --> 02:43:03,054
That's a duck deck.
So they come in hot coming in hot 

3977
02:43:06,750 --> 02:43:07,583
because the females have been like 
program to try to prevent rape and the 

3978
02:43:10,801 --> 02:43:12,970
way they've been programmed to try to 
prevent rape.

3979
02:43:12,971 --> 02:43:15,970
They develop these like labyrinth 
pussies.

3980
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:17,860
Like look at that in the upper right 
hand corner and Jamie,

3981
02:43:17,861 --> 02:43:18,694
there's a female pussy,
female pussy as opposed to what boy 

3982
02:43:22,061 --> 02:43:23,380
posted it.
That's what I get in jail.

3983
02:43:23,680 --> 02:43:25,120
That's a,
that's like the,

3984
02:43:25,270 --> 02:43:26,103
the inside of a uh,
a female duck and they have like these 

3985
02:43:29,621 --> 02:43:31,960
little trap doors where the Dick can't 
get through.

3986
02:43:32,050 --> 02:43:32,883
So they have to like allow the Dick to 
get through and they can actually cut 

3987
02:43:36,971 --> 02:43:38,200
off the breeding process.

3988
02:43:38,200 --> 02:43:42,790
They can choose what male society in a 
lot of ways to deal with.

3989
02:43:43,190 --> 02:43:44,190
Yeah,
it does.

3990
02:43:44,310 --> 02:43:45,490
It does.
It's super important.

3991
02:43:47,050 --> 02:43:50,140
Loud.
They don't have a trap door,

3992
02:43:50,141 --> 02:43:52,360
but it's,
it might be 10 years,

3993
02:43:52,390 --> 02:43:54,490
but all they do is rape each other and 
the duck world,

3994
02:43:54,520 --> 02:43:56,440
they're just biting each other and 
raping each other.

3995
02:43:56,441 --> 02:43:59,140
I love hunting ducks.
Probably one of my turkeys.

3996
02:44:00,080 --> 02:44:00,791
Turkeys,
pheasants.

3997
02:44:00,791 --> 02:44:02,440
Doug has the order of birds.
I love to hunt.

3998
02:44:02,530 --> 02:44:05,110
I've heard that Turkey with a bow and 
Arrow is the shit.

3999
02:44:05,270 --> 02:44:07,270
I love it.
He's able to center punch or you can try

4000
02:44:07,271 --> 02:44:12,271
and give the teen it off with them with 
those crazy I've tried so you got to get

4001
02:44:12,491 --> 02:44:13,324
them really close.
You got to get really close and you've 

4002
02:44:15,151 --> 02:44:17,710
got to get him when he,
when he's up like cooking,

4003
02:44:17,730 --> 02:44:18,563
you know that can fucking cha and 
usually when you draw it back he sees 

4004
02:44:23,111 --> 02:44:24,310
you and they're out of there.

4005
02:44:24,400 --> 02:44:28,210
I shot the first one that ever shot last
year and it was delicious,

4006
02:44:28,300 --> 02:44:29,590
but it was,
it was a young one.

4007
02:44:29,620 --> 02:44:30,453
It was only a year old and Steve 
[inaudible] was telling me that a three 

4008
02:44:32,201 --> 02:44:35,740
year old Turkey is super old and most of
them never lived to be three,

4009
02:44:35,950 --> 02:44:39,580
but I was amazed at how big they are.
They're fucking mungus right.

4010
02:44:40,680 --> 02:44:41,560
I went,
I just went down.

4011
02:44:41,561 --> 02:44:45,220
I got invited to a high on the,
a real tree plantation down in Georgia,

4012
02:44:45,910 --> 02:44:47,800
which I felt like was the butterball 
form.

4013
02:44:47,801 --> 02:44:48,634
Like,
I feel like this let a bunch of turkeys 

4014
02:44:49,091 --> 02:44:51,160
out of trap doors and we just smelled 
them now.

4015
02:44:51,161 --> 02:44:52,870
I mean we a hundred for two days before 
we got one.

4016
02:44:52,871 --> 02:44:54,450
But you thought that going in?
Yeah,

4017
02:44:54,460 --> 02:44:55,060
I was like,
great.

4018
02:44:55,060 --> 02:44:58,210
This is going to be like so easy.
They can't do that though.

4019
02:44:58,211 --> 02:45:00,040
Real trees like an establish hunting 
brand.

4020
02:45:00,680 --> 02:45:02,440
Everything.
It was fun,

4021
02:45:02,441 --> 02:45:03,274
you know?
Uh,

4022
02:45:03,340 --> 02:45:06,250
we got the birds and uh,
it was so good.

4023
02:45:06,340 --> 02:45:08,290
So good.
It tastes so much better.

4024
02:45:08,291 --> 02:45:09,670
I mean,
the same thing with wild pigs.

4025
02:45:09,671 --> 02:45:12,040
They taste so much better than 
domesticated animals.

4026
02:45:12,280 --> 02:45:15,430
When you domesticate animals to just,
you fuck up the whole system,

4027
02:45:16,090 --> 02:45:17,860
but you have to like the game.
Do you like lamb?

4028
02:45:18,010 --> 02:45:19,580
Are you a lamb?
Lamb is,

4029
02:45:19,660 --> 02:45:21,210
you don't like lamb,
lamb chops.

4030
02:45:21,720 --> 02:45:24,100
I don't like the game in it.
You don't like gave me food.

4031
02:45:24,130 --> 02:45:25,990
I don't think lambs gave me at all.
Fuck.

4032
02:45:25,991 --> 02:45:28,510
Yes it is really lamb.
Huh?

4033
02:45:28,720 --> 02:45:31,050
Maybe you've had a bad,
I've had all lines,

4034
02:45:31,060 --> 02:45:33,670
a restaurant over here in woodland hills
called brandywine.

4035
02:45:33,730 --> 02:45:36,190
If you have a rack of lamb from them.
Oh,

4036
02:45:36,460 --> 02:45:38,050
game on.
Might Change your mind,

4037
02:45:38,410 --> 02:45:39,570
Donald.
All right.

4038
02:45:39,640 --> 02:45:41,500
You've got to go with someone who's 
preparing it correctly.

4039
02:45:41,500 --> 02:45:44,200
If you had an a restaurant before I had 
it in a restaurant,

4040
02:45:44,201 --> 02:45:47,220
I'd had it at my house everywhere.
Hmm.

4041
02:45:47,440 --> 02:45:49,300
Not had to domesticate a lamb.
See,

4042
02:45:49,301 --> 02:45:51,220
I don't know what it tastes like to you.
That's the,

4043
02:45:51,290 --> 02:45:53,320
I think that's a weird thing about taste
buds.

4044
02:45:53,410 --> 02:45:55,810
Like some people weren't a weird chain.
Very good point.

4045
02:45:55,870 --> 02:45:57,220
I don't know what the fuck they're 
experiencing.

4046
02:45:57,221 --> 02:45:59,080
I'm just guessing based on my 
experience.

4047
02:45:59,570 --> 02:46:04,570
Like I like really hot foods,
Jalapenos and a Habanero peppers.

4048
02:46:04,901 --> 02:46:05,734
I like fuck I cooked with hot shit and 
you cook them and Piss them off and get 

4049
02:46:08,931 --> 02:46:11,900
me an hots.
Yeah.

4050
02:46:11,901 --> 02:46:15,020
I like em raw too though.
Sometimes I try the Jalapenos Ra,

4051
02:46:15,230 --> 02:46:17,690
I found out that just a little bit of 
cooking knows the way to do it.

4052
02:46:18,070 --> 02:46:20,480
Cause Jalapeno Raul will give you 
immediate johnny rocket.

4053
02:46:20,840 --> 02:46:22,510
Yeah.
Got a little bit holy fuck.

4054
02:46:22,610 --> 02:46:23,450
Three of them last night.

4055
02:46:23,450 --> 02:46:27,530
Big Fat boys within [inaudible] 
Genetically Modified Jalapenos game on.

4056
02:46:27,531 --> 02:46:28,640
Yeah,
they're like a duck dick.

4057
02:46:29,170 --> 02:46:31,440
It's a big ass Jalapeno.
But uh,

4058
02:46:35,360 --> 02:46:36,193
I like hot food.
But I don't know what hot food tastes 

4059
02:46:38,061 --> 02:46:39,810
like to other people.
I just know what it tastes like.

4060
02:46:39,811 --> 02:46:40,644
Hi.
But I know that some shit that I can't 

4061
02:46:41,751 --> 02:46:42,680
tolerate.
I,

4062
02:46:42,681 --> 02:46:45,770
there was a restaurant that used to be 
here in Encino,

4063
02:46:45,920 --> 02:46:48,050
but the dude died unfortunately,
but it's called Chili,

4064
02:46:48,051 --> 02:46:48,884
my soul.
And it was an all chili restaurant and 

4065
02:46:50,961 --> 02:46:54,770
you would go there and they had like the
Scoville rankings of the,

4066
02:46:55,130 --> 02:46:57,620
which goes up to like 10 which is 
impossible to eat,

4067
02:46:57,650 --> 02:47:00,560
but they had nines,
they had nines and they gave me a cup of

4068
02:47:00,561 --> 02:47:02,060
nines.
And when I say a cop,

4069
02:47:02,210 --> 02:47:04,190
I mean like a fucking thimble.
And I was like,

4070
02:47:04,191 --> 02:47:05,330
really?
He's like,

4071
02:47:05,331 --> 02:47:05,901
yeah,
really?

4072
02:47:05,901 --> 02:47:06,351
I go,
okay,

4073
02:47:06,351 --> 02:47:06,720
I'll try it.

4074
02:47:06,720 --> 02:47:07,720
She went nine.
Yeah.

4075
02:47:07,760 --> 02:47:08,593
So he goes,
just a little spoonful gauge and I 

4076
02:47:11,361 --> 02:47:13,880
couldn't fucking believe how hot it was.
Sweating.

4077
02:47:13,970 --> 02:47:15,620
I'm sweating,
pouring sweat,

4078
02:47:15,621 --> 02:47:16,454
and like I'm sweating.
Do you sweat when something's hot that 

4079
02:47:17,961 --> 02:47:19,010
you need?
I don't know man.

4080
02:47:19,160 --> 02:47:20,110
I like it though.
That's half.

4081
02:47:20,130 --> 02:47:24,230
What I like about it at the Jalapenos,
mass sweating,

4082
02:47:24,470 --> 02:47:27,290
it's just pouring.
Like I was in a sauna last night.

4083
02:47:28,190 --> 02:47:31,520
It's beautiful that you killed like a 
man with a bow,

4084
02:47:31,550 --> 02:47:33,420
like a man,
like a man.

4085
02:47:33,421 --> 02:47:34,880
The man.
Yeah,

4086
02:47:34,881 --> 02:47:36,410
that's a,
that's a freak out man.

4087
02:47:36,411 --> 02:47:37,244
That's,
that's probably my number one addiction 

4088
02:47:38,541 --> 02:47:39,910
right now.
Taking a vacation soon.

4089
02:47:39,920 --> 02:47:40,541
Going to Elka,
Andrea.

4090
02:47:40,541 --> 02:47:44,300
I'm going on a bunch of them.
I feel like if I was me,

4091
02:47:44,330 --> 02:47:46,130
if I wasn't me and I said,
man,

4092
02:47:46,131 --> 02:47:46,964
if I was that dude,
I'd go on a bunch of fucking hunting 

4093
02:47:48,351 --> 02:47:49,184
trips.
I'm going on a bunch of fucking hunting 

4094
02:47:50,031 --> 02:47:50,810
trips.

4095
02:47:50,810 --> 02:47:52,670
I give a bunch of meat out to my 
friends.

4096
02:47:53,450 --> 02:47:55,490
I eat it all myself.
It's all I eat.

4097
02:47:55,510 --> 02:47:56,150
I don't,
I don't.

4098
02:47:56,150 --> 02:47:57,470
I very,
very,

4099
02:47:57,471 --> 02:47:58,304
very rarely buy domestic meet now and if
I do it's because like I need to cook 

4100
02:48:02,031 --> 02:48:02,864
something.
That night I got some friends coming 

4101
02:48:03,711 --> 02:48:04,544
over and I didn't defrost anything and I
just got to bang it out quick for the 

4102
02:48:07,641 --> 02:48:11,600
most part or if somebody wants it,
but I don't feel bad.

4103
02:48:11,780 --> 02:48:13,280
I don't feel bad when I eat.
No,

4104
02:48:13,290 --> 02:48:14,123
because you domestic meat or a like a a 
wild game and you don't to resource in 

4105
02:48:19,821 --> 02:48:22,330
a,
in a beautiful one hunter.

4106
02:48:22,590 --> 02:48:23,423
Yeah.
He just went and cut the head off and 

4107
02:48:23,931 --> 02:48:24,501
you're like,
oh yeah,

4108
02:48:24,501 --> 02:48:26,960
I get men.
Me and Calvin got him.

4109
02:48:27,040 --> 02:48:29,210
Yeah,
we got you fucking got this leopard.

4110
02:48:29,211 --> 02:48:31,640
I'm going to fuck it to suck his 
eyeballs out.

4111
02:48:32,900 --> 02:48:33,733
Yeah.
There's something fucked up about 

4112
02:48:34,671 --> 02:48:36,350
killing things just cause you can kill 
them.

4113
02:48:36,830 --> 02:48:38,840
But uh,
I want a human,

4114
02:48:39,770 --> 02:48:40,603
it depends on how good they taste.
You need to find out what do you think 

4115
02:48:44,421 --> 02:48:45,254
of healing?
Tastes like?

4116
02:48:45,260 --> 02:48:47,540
Probably like pig.
You think that's what they say.

4117
02:48:47,570 --> 02:48:50,030
They call him long.
Who's Day people have eaten them.

4118
02:48:50,360 --> 02:48:51,410
Cannibals.
They call him,

4119
02:48:51,440 --> 02:48:53,150
they call him long pigs.
They've actually,

4120
02:48:53,300 --> 02:48:54,133
and you think what we eat like am I,
would I be a little sweeter because I'm 

4121
02:48:56,061 --> 02:48:58,490
a skittle.
Milko kind of probably delicious.

4122
02:48:58,610 --> 02:49:03,610
Marianne.
I'm a beer battered cowboy here.

4123
02:49:05,280 --> 02:49:10,280
Your Hams and tastes like white goop.
You beef those fucking cows.

4124
02:49:12,691 --> 02:49:15,930
They peed beard to in Japan.
Yeah.

4125
02:49:15,931 --> 02:49:17,760
Mandy probably tastes delicious.
Why?

4126
02:49:17,860 --> 02:49:19,950
I know that like animals,
they eat certain things.

4127
02:49:19,951 --> 02:49:20,910
Like,
here's a perfect example.

4128
02:49:20,911 --> 02:49:24,150
Bears of bears eat salmon.
Like a friend of mine,

4129
02:49:24,170 --> 02:49:26,040
um,
made a bear ham out of a bear.

4130
02:49:26,040 --> 02:49:26,873
They called coastal bear and he said it 
tasted like you were eating like smoked 

4131
02:49:30,241 --> 02:49:32,940
salmon.
They smoked a ham from a bear.

4132
02:49:33,060 --> 02:49:35,910
It tasted like smoked salmon.
Looks like beef.

4133
02:49:36,080 --> 02:49:38,850
You would have to taste like what you 
ate is you're putting it right.

4134
02:49:38,851 --> 02:49:39,870
You'd have to,
yeah.

4135
02:49:39,990 --> 02:49:40,823
Well that's the other thing is blueberry
bears like bears in the fall that are 

4136
02:49:45,090 --> 02:49:45,923
stocking up on blueberries are 
apparently one of the most delicious 

4137
02:49:48,241 --> 02:49:50,790
things you could eat ever.
It's supposed to be incredible.

4138
02:49:51,150 --> 02:49:51,983
Like guys like purposely hunt only in 
the fall and only over blueberry 

4139
02:49:55,711 --> 02:49:56,544
patches.
Just cause they want to catch a 

4140
02:49:57,271 --> 02:49:59,280
blueberry bear.
You've never had a blueberry bear.

4141
02:49:59,310 --> 02:50:01,230
Never had it.
It's supposed to be amazing.

4142
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,140
It's supposed to be amazing.
It's supposed to be like one of the most

4143
02:50:04,141 --> 02:50:05,790
delicious things you can eat.
So yeah,

4144
02:50:05,791 --> 02:50:07,320
I think,
and when you cut them open,

4145
02:50:07,321 --> 02:50:08,490
they smell like blueberries.

4146
02:50:08,640 --> 02:50:09,473
Like they're fat,
smells like blueberries is the fattest 

4147
02:50:10,771 --> 02:50:12,240
purple.
It's like a purple fat.

4148
02:50:12,570 --> 02:50:14,850
This is like a video of it.
Like Steve Rinella.

4149
02:50:14,940 --> 02:50:16,500
How many bears have you killed?
Three.

4150
02:50:18,420 --> 02:50:21,510
Did you like make a cool necklace out of
his cloth or anything?

4151
02:50:21,720 --> 02:50:25,620
I have rugs of rugs I made out of them 
head still attached.

4152
02:50:25,920 --> 02:50:27,470
You know,
heads of time have to write.

4153
02:50:27,490 --> 02:50:28,323
You're going to have a bear rug.
You have to have the clause in the head 

4154
02:50:29,441 --> 02:50:30,274
on,
it's got to do it.

4155
02:50:30,370 --> 02:50:32,370
Let's go ahead of me.
People are weirded out by it.

4156
02:50:32,430 --> 02:50:33,620
I don't think so.
I think I'd,

4157
02:50:34,320 --> 02:50:35,153
that'd be a pretty bad ass thing.
Haven't right in your centerpiece eat m 

4158
02:50:38,610 --> 02:50:39,443
and a in where I hunt in Alberta,
they have to kill them because they 

4159
02:50:42,601 --> 02:50:44,550
don't have no natural predators.
So this is,

4160
02:50:44,551 --> 02:50:45,384
uh,
this is Steve Rinella doing it on that 

4161
02:50:46,831 --> 02:50:47,040
show.

4162
02:50:47,040 --> 02:50:48,180
Mediator.
But see how the,

4163
02:50:48,181 --> 02:50:50,890
the fat has got like a purple hue to it.
Yeah.

4164
02:50:51,210 --> 02:50:52,800
Yeah.
He takes that stuff and he,

4165
02:50:52,801 --> 02:50:53,634
uh,
makes lard out of it with that purple 

4166
02:50:54,841 --> 02:50:56,070
fat.
Look at it.

4167
02:50:56,100 --> 02:50:57,670
See how weird it looks,
right?

4168
02:50:57,930 --> 02:50:58,500
Yeah.
That's,

4169
02:50:58,500 --> 02:51:01,140
that's fat from a bear that's been 
eating blueberries.

4170
02:51:01,290 --> 02:51:02,123
See,
but we have this fucking jungle book 

4171
02:51:03,781 --> 02:51:04,614
view of animals.
So people look at bears like your 

4172
02:51:06,511 --> 02:51:07,344
friends,
like your friend bears are all 

4173
02:51:09,181 --> 02:51:11,400
cannibals.
All of them are eating cubs,

4174
02:51:11,401 --> 02:51:13,680
especially the ones that we go after,
which are all the males?

4175
02:51:13,740 --> 02:51:16,430
No Kin,
they eat their own cut 100% wow.

4176
02:51:16,470 --> 02:51:17,303
They all do.
They'll eat every cub they could get 

4177
02:51:18,421 --> 02:51:19,380
ahold of.
Why not?

4178
02:51:19,381 --> 02:51:21,180
Why wouldn't you just do?
Well,

4179
02:51:21,181 --> 02:51:22,014
I think,
I think part of that is because they 

4180
02:51:24,031 --> 02:51:24,864
don't have a natural predator.
So I think nature balances itself out 

4181
02:51:27,480 --> 02:51:30,470
and when there's no natural Predator,
I think evil out.

4182
02:51:30,540 --> 02:51:31,373
Yeah.
I think what happens is these bears 

4183
02:51:32,581 --> 02:51:36,130
become predators against themselves and 
they,

4184
02:51:36,131 --> 02:51:36,964
they eat cubs and they don't want 
competition with these young males that 

4185
02:51:39,361 --> 02:51:40,194
are coming up and they also want the 
female to come back into estrus or they 

4186
02:51:42,421 --> 02:51:43,254
could bleed breed again.
So they just eat cubs and they eat them 

4187
02:51:45,421 --> 02:51:46,254
for food.
They're finding now that they actually 

4188
02:51:47,611 --> 02:51:48,444
go actively hunting for him,
it's like his is a terrible video of 

4189
02:51:51,271 --> 02:51:54,890
this polar bear killing this cup that's 
the female there next to him.

4190
02:51:54,891 --> 02:51:55,724
Like the females on the right and she's 
trying to keep him off and he's killing 

4191
02:51:59,551 --> 02:52:02,520
her cub right now and eaten it.
It's so common.

4192
02:52:02,610 --> 02:52:05,510
It's,
it's 100% of the males cubs.

4193
02:52:05,550 --> 02:52:06,383
100%

4194
02:52:06,580 --> 02:52:09,400
could you fucking imagine getting mauled
by a polar bear?

4195
02:52:09,580 --> 02:52:10,413
Oh Man.
Well they're the most fucked up ones 

4196
02:52:12,461 --> 02:52:13,294
because they come out of the womb as 
predators because they don't eat 

4197
02:52:16,391 --> 02:52:17,224
anything but meat.
They're the only bear that doesn't eat 

4198
02:52:19,091 --> 02:52:20,680
grass.
They don't eat anything else.

4199
02:52:20,681 --> 02:52:22,500
Cause they look at their environment 
there.

4200
02:52:22,510 --> 02:52:23,343
They're there to eat seals and other 
bears and the way they keep the 

4201
02:52:26,201 --> 02:52:28,150
population down,
it's by eating each other.

4202
02:52:28,151 --> 02:52:29,950
It's fucked up.
And that's,

4203
02:52:29,980 --> 02:52:33,580
that's a simplistic description of it on
the shore biologist we mad at me,

4204
02:52:33,790 --> 02:52:35,530
but there's definitely merit in what I'm
saying.

4205
02:52:35,800 --> 02:52:38,440
There's gotta be nature doesn't do that 
with a wolves.

4206
02:52:38,441 --> 02:52:40,420
Don't eat each other.
You know,

4207
02:52:40,421 --> 02:52:42,940
tigers don't eat each other and have a 
predator.

4208
02:52:42,970 --> 02:52:45,430
Exactly.
I don't know what t Predator Tigers have

4209
02:52:45,431 --> 02:52:49,120
other than people,
but I think maybe tigers have had people

4210
02:52:49,121 --> 02:52:52,600
as a Predator for so long that it kind 
of balances itself out.

4211
02:52:53,770 --> 02:52:54,603
But bears man up there by themselves.
Polar bears eat the shit out of each 

4212
02:52:58,631 --> 02:53:01,120
other,
and then a lot of the places where bears

4213
02:53:01,121 --> 02:53:01,954
are like even black bear,
it's like they're in these dense wooded 

4214
02:53:03,851 --> 02:53:04,684
areas where nothing other than grizzlies
can kill a black bear other than black 

4215
02:53:08,861 --> 02:53:10,000
bear.
So they kill each other.

4216
02:53:10,001 --> 02:53:10,834
It's,
it's,

4217
02:53:11,020 --> 02:53:15,040
it's a dark existence man and circle of 
life.

4218
02:53:15,130 --> 02:53:15,963
And for hunting populations,
like the people up there that live in 

4219
02:53:17,771 --> 02:53:19,090
Alberta,
they need moose,

4220
02:53:19,360 --> 02:53:20,193
they need deer.
It's like a main staple of these 

4221
02:53:21,710 --> 02:53:24,160
people's diet.
Like there's a lot of folks that live up

4222
02:53:24,161 --> 02:53:25,720
there that don't,
they don't buy meat,

4223
02:53:26,050 --> 02:53:26,883
so they have to keep those bear 
populations in check because they kill 

4224
02:53:29,321 --> 02:53:33,370
more than 50% of all the Fonz of all the
Moose calves.

4225
02:53:33,371 --> 02:53:38,371
What the population control in hunting,
like you said,

4226
02:53:38,771 --> 02:53:40,900
is it has to be done well.

4227
02:53:40,990 --> 02:53:42,790
It people think it doesn't have to be 
done,

4228
02:53:42,791 --> 02:53:45,090
but they don't understand the numbers I 
used to be done.

4229
02:53:45,140 --> 02:53:45,973
You look at the populations of people in
this country that die every year from 

4230
02:53:48,400 --> 02:53:49,240
accidents.
With deer.

4231
02:53:49,241 --> 02:53:50,074
It's 201.5
million car accidents every year in the 

4232
02:53:53,021 --> 02:53:56,590
United States alone with deer.
It's no other way.

4233
02:53:56,620 --> 02:53:57,453
I mean,
there's one solution they want to 

4234
02:53:58,421 --> 02:54:00,940
reintroduce cougars,
which is a,

4235
02:54:01,090 --> 02:54:02,440
yeah,
I mean that'll work.

4236
02:54:02,441 --> 02:54:04,000
That'll definitely keep the numbers 
down,

4237
02:54:04,090 --> 02:54:05,020
but it's,
uh,

4238
02:54:05,080 --> 02:54:05,913
it's very tricky.
You're bringing in an apex Predator and 

4239
02:54:08,171 --> 02:54:11,860
hacks Predator and you'll only has an,
a finite supply of food.

4240
02:54:11,980 --> 02:54:14,140
You're going to have to bring in some 
people that are going to have to control

4241
02:54:14,141 --> 02:54:16,330
those apex predators.
And that's what we have in California.

4242
02:54:16,450 --> 02:54:17,283
There's a bunch of people that are 
professional mountain lion hunters that 

4243
02:54:20,111 --> 02:54:20,944
are employed by the state of California.
And when there's a problem mountain 

4244
02:54:22,970 --> 02:54:23,803
line,
they go and kill it and it's all hush 

4245
02:54:24,371 --> 02:54:24,910
hush.

4246
02:54:24,910 --> 02:54:27,130
Don't talk about it.
But they kill a hundred of them a year.

4247
02:54:27,370 --> 02:54:28,203
Wow.
And they're all filled with cats and 

4248
02:54:29,231 --> 02:54:31,810
dogs and cats and dogs.
Yeah,

4249
02:54:31,811 --> 02:54:32,820
of course.
Yeah,

4250
02:54:32,890 --> 02:54:34,140
because that's easy.
Yeah,

4251
02:54:34,150 --> 02:54:35,230
it's easy.
Easy going.

4252
02:54:35,300 --> 02:54:37,780
They got him in the backyard,
caged up watch.

4253
02:54:37,781 --> 02:54:40,960
He's a fucking d right?
He's got some growing out of his head.

4254
02:54:40,961 --> 02:54:43,330
You might break a leg chasing after and 
I can just pray down.

4255
02:54:43,331 --> 02:54:44,164
And this dog on a leash,
stupid fat rottweiler sitting in your 

4256
02:54:47,891 --> 02:54:50,080
yard with no balls.
Why did you take his balls?

4257
02:54:50,870 --> 02:54:53,080
It's really,
it makes it Nicer Jack.

4258
02:54:53,081 --> 02:54:53,914
I'm would carry him over the fence.
Like there are a rag doll that's a a 

4259
02:54:57,070 --> 02:54:58,900
pecs predator.
Wow.

4260
02:54:59,470 --> 02:55:01,180
I've never seen a mountain lion in the 
real and the real world.

4261
02:55:01,181 --> 02:55:03,920
Have they?
How close am I?

4262
02:55:03,921 --> 02:55:04,070
Old

4263
02:55:04,070 --> 02:55:04,903
Tree fort at my cabin there was one I 
crawled up the ladder and he was in 

4264
02:55:06,501 --> 02:55:07,550
Atlanta,
my blankets.

4265
02:55:07,810 --> 02:55:09,450
Ooh.

4266
02:55:09,630 --> 02:55:11,280
And then you watched me for about a 
week.

4267
02:55:11,760 --> 02:55:14,640
Holy Shit.
So you crawled up there.

4268
02:55:14,641 --> 02:55:18,630
How old were you?
10 or 12 oh my God.

4269
02:55:19,380 --> 02:55:22,470
Oh,
10 or 12 so you crowds a lot of,

4270
02:55:22,471 --> 02:55:24,150
you had no idea.
No idea.

4271
02:55:24,180 --> 02:55:25,890
He gets to the top.
And what are you looking at?

4272
02:55:26,310 --> 02:55:31,310
A big ass cat lane on my blankets.
Is he looking at you and not really.

4273
02:55:31,621 --> 02:55:34,380
He was just kind of laid out there and I
was like,

4274
02:55:34,470 --> 02:55:35,303
Oh shit.
And just went back down the ladder and 

4275
02:55:36,330 --> 02:55:37,710
ran to the house.
And then he,

4276
02:55:37,711 --> 02:55:38,544
uh,
kind of just sat there for about a week 

4277
02:55:41,161 --> 02:55:44,360
while we were there and just watched us.
Oh my goodness.

4278
02:55:44,370 --> 02:55:46,560
Even the trees all week long.
He didn't move.

4279
02:55:46,561 --> 02:55:49,170
He just sat there and watched us took 
over your tree for it.

4280
02:55:49,200 --> 02:55:51,900
He did a little fucker.
Oh my God.

4281
02:55:52,370 --> 02:55:53,400
Yeah.
That's terrifying.

4282
02:55:53,430 --> 02:55:54,990
Nothing South Park,
Colorado.

4283
02:55:55,500 --> 02:55:56,333
Holy Shit.
And what was he eating while I was 

4284
02:55:57,301 --> 02:55:58,440
living in your tree for it?

4285
02:55:58,590 --> 02:56:00,860
I think he was waiting on me.
Wow.

4286
02:56:01,480 --> 02:56:03,750
This all now.
Holy Shit.

4287
02:56:04,300 --> 02:56:06,480
When I mean the tree fort,
it wasn't even that high.

4288
02:56:06,481 --> 02:56:10,830
I mean,
I bet you eight or 10 ladder rungs.

4289
02:56:11,200 --> 02:56:12,400
Whoa,
whoa.

4290
02:56:12,410 --> 02:56:14,430
Poetry.
Holy Fuck.

4291
02:56:14,440 --> 02:56:16,830
Maybe 200 yards from the house.
I mean,

4292
02:56:16,831 --> 02:56:19,170
it was just right there.
And how'd you know when he was gone?

4293
02:56:19,800 --> 02:56:20,633
We went home.
I didn't know he was gone and we just 

4294
02:56:21,871 --> 02:56:23,130
left for the weekend.
That was it.

4295
02:56:23,131 --> 02:56:24,990
And family vacation was done.
Oh,

4296
02:56:24,991 --> 02:56:25,651
okay.
Yeah,

4297
02:56:25,651 --> 02:56:27,360
we didn't live there.
We just go up there and hang out.

4298
02:56:27,390 --> 02:56:32,000
Oh fuck.
God Damn it.

4299
02:56:32,010 --> 02:56:33,780
Fucking wild.
Crazy.

4300
02:56:34,320 --> 02:56:38,010
I seen where I drove by a fucking 
massive bear.

4301
02:56:38,430 --> 02:56:41,160
Um,
down the four wheelers trail.

4302
02:56:41,161 --> 02:56:43,800
He was standing right there next minute.
Just drove right by and I was like,

4303
02:56:43,830 --> 02:56:44,663
Oh shit.
I seen a bear chase a kid on a mountain 

4304
02:56:47,041 --> 02:56:48,930
bike.
He's just in Colorado on Colorado.

4305
02:56:49,110 --> 02:56:51,090
I was on [inaudible],
right?

4306
02:56:51,100 --> 02:56:52,020
Yeah.
Black bears.

4307
02:56:52,380 --> 02:56:54,120
There's only a few brown bears in 
Colorado,

4308
02:56:54,121 --> 02:56:55,020
right?
It's not that many.

4309
02:56:55,140 --> 02:56:55,973
It was definitely a brock bear,
but I did see a brown bear chase a 

4310
02:56:58,891 --> 02:57:01,170
fucking kid.
Really Chase the kid.

4311
02:57:01,590 --> 02:57:02,423
Was it a color phase?
Black bear might have been a color 

4312
02:57:03,751 --> 02:57:04,584
phase.
I don't mean he looked Brown and Bill 

4313
02:57:05,990 --> 02:57:07,260
Young.
Oh my God.

4314
02:57:07,350 --> 02:57:08,183
He was chasing a kid.
You're out riding our dirt bikes and 

4315
02:57:09,391 --> 02:57:12,450
there was a little kid on a little 50,
like a whole range ahead of us.

4316
02:57:12,720 --> 02:57:13,553
And you've seen the bear fucking hauling
ass down the mountain after the kid on 

4317
02:57:17,221 --> 02:57:18,054
the,
on the bike.

4318
02:57:19,290 --> 02:57:21,930
It was insane.
Oh fuck that.

4319
02:57:21,931 --> 02:57:22,764
Yeah.
Apparently more black bears kill people 

4320
02:57:25,351 --> 02:57:26,184
then brown bears.
Apparently black bears are much more 

4321
02:57:29,131 --> 02:57:31,710
likely to be predators on people than 
brown bears are.

4322
02:57:32,040 --> 02:57:33,810
It's not impossible that a brown bear 
would do it,

4323
02:57:33,960 --> 02:57:35,700
but it's more likely that a black pair 
would do it.

4324
02:57:36,010 --> 02:57:37,110
I don't,
I don't know why.

4325
02:57:37,910 --> 02:57:38,790
Yeah.
I had a line just,

4326
02:57:39,210 --> 02:57:40,043
I've never been attacked by anything 
like that and that was a close to your 

4327
02:57:41,400 --> 02:57:43,970
bed,
but nittany that neither incident graced

4328
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:44,833
a threat to me.
Rinella was telling me about this one 

4329
02:57:46,771 --> 02:57:49,860
dude that he knows who took a,
someone he knows on a,

4330
02:57:49,890 --> 02:57:50,723
the first hunting trip ever in the tent 
gets attacked by a 500 pound predatory 

4331
02:57:55,501 --> 02:57:58,170
black bear to attack.
Some goes in the tent.

4332
02:57:58,200 --> 02:58:00,060
I was trying to eat him,
grabs his head.

4333
02:58:00,300 --> 02:58:01,980
The Dude's comes

4334
02:58:01,980 --> 02:58:05,070
in,
shoots some shoots through the bear,

4335
02:58:05,071 --> 02:58:06,960
hits the dude in the wrist.
Oh Shit.

4336
02:58:06,990 --> 02:58:09,630
So the bullet passes through the bear 
hits.

4337
02:58:09,631 --> 02:58:12,900
The guy,
breaks his arm for the bear runs out and

4338
02:58:12,901 --> 02:58:15,090
then they have to chase the bear down 
and runs into another tent.

4339
02:58:15,110 --> 02:58:19,080
I have to shoot the bear first,
first hunting trip ever.

4340
02:58:20,580 --> 02:58:21,413
Well,
they got it.

4341
02:58:21,620 --> 02:58:22,650
Got It.
Yeah.

4342
02:58:22,651 --> 02:58:23,484
I mean,
what a student had a backpack and had a 

4343
02:58:25,410 --> 02:58:26,243
black bear and her two cubs in our camp.
We woke up in the morning on zip to 10 

4344
02:58:28,711 --> 02:58:29,544
there was,
I just took my 45 and just unloaded and 

4345
02:58:31,861 --> 02:58:34,070
in the sky.
Well that's good news is,

4346
02:58:34,080 --> 02:58:37,110
is it?
Oh yeah.

4347
02:58:37,170 --> 02:58:38,550
And they ran off.
Wow.

4348
02:58:38,551 --> 02:58:40,050
Right there.
Right there in our,

4349
02:58:40,051 --> 02:58:41,910
in our little area.
Holy Shit.

4350
02:58:42,010 --> 02:58:44,720
W The mamas are the most dangerous,
the Mama.

4351
02:58:45,260 --> 02:58:47,270
And they say that's the big thing that 
happens in like,

4352
02:58:47,550 --> 02:58:51,210
like a yosemite or yellowstone rather in
yellowstone when people are,

4353
02:58:51,211 --> 02:58:52,690
uh,
tromping around there,

4354
02:58:52,800 --> 02:58:57,050
just fuck up near become,
and the mom is like that up.

4355
02:58:57,210 --> 02:58:58,720
I can just take care of this real quick.
Yeah.

4356
02:58:59,780 --> 02:59:01,400
Just rip you apart.
God,

4357
02:59:01,550 --> 02:59:03,540
could you imagine fucking get in a 
tussle with a bear?

4358
02:59:04,110 --> 02:59:06,150
Oh,
you're not equipped for that?

4359
02:59:06,270 --> 02:59:07,530
No.
No.

4360
02:59:07,680 --> 02:59:09,300
Do you ever see that video with the 
spirit?

4361
02:59:09,301 --> 02:59:11,520
I don't even know if you gave me a 
spear.

4362
02:59:11,610 --> 02:59:14,940
No.
And said in the red core,

4363
02:59:15,810 --> 02:59:17,340
right?
I don't know.

4364
02:59:17,790 --> 02:59:20,340
I'd be standing there like,
holy fuck.

4365
02:59:20,400 --> 02:59:21,233
What is this dude doing with his club?
Keep gotten bears pictures on Google 

4366
02:59:24,061 --> 02:59:25,890
search.
This was found on Google maps.

4367
02:59:26,040 --> 02:59:26,873
A fat Russian dude just beat the shit 
out of that bear with a stick that's 

4368
02:59:29,431 --> 02:59:30,264
could beat dad.

4369
02:59:34,460 --> 02:59:35,370
Holy Fuck.
Yeah.

4370
02:59:35,371 --> 02:59:36,204
I don't know what I'd do.
I you gave me a spear like you're the 

4371
02:59:38,821 --> 02:59:41,640
guy who judged by that killed a bear 
with a spear is impressive.

4372
02:59:42,030 --> 02:59:42,850
Yeah.
What do you do?

4373
02:59:42,850 --> 02:59:43,683
Have your one shot and you blow it.
Now that mother fucker's like zoop mad 

4374
02:59:47,371 --> 02:59:48,990
at you.
Mad at calming and hot.

4375
02:59:49,020 --> 02:59:51,300
Did he have a side arm with him?
I don't think he did.

4376
02:59:51,330 --> 02:59:52,163
So my question is if I go spear hunting 
with a bear and I unload my spear and 

4377
02:59:57,481 --> 03:00:00,150
the bear mauls me,
can I then shoot the bear with a pistol?

4378
03:00:00,180 --> 03:00:01,013
Yes,
you could definitely shoot the bear to 

4379
03:00:01,711 --> 03:00:02,760
stay alive.
Stay alive,

4380
03:00:03,480 --> 03:00:06,690
stay alive.
Berto has an open weapon policy.

4381
03:00:06,691 --> 03:00:09,360
Like you can use a rifle,
you can use a shotgun,

4382
03:00:09,510 --> 03:00:11,700
you can use a crossbow.
A spirit is the spirit.

4383
03:00:12,140 --> 03:00:14,610
You're going to outlaw spears.
Now because of the outrage.

4384
03:00:14,610 --> 03:00:15,443
Cause everybody's pissed,
which I think is honestly a good idea 

4385
03:00:17,160 --> 03:00:20,460
because most people are not going to be 
equipped to do it the way that guy does.

4386
03:00:20,461 --> 03:00:21,294
At the very least.
I think if you're going to kill a bear 

4387
03:00:22,171 --> 03:00:23,950
with a spirit,
I have to go through some sort of uh,

4388
03:00:24,220 --> 03:00:26,520
um,
spear checking academy.

4389
03:00:26,640 --> 03:00:27,473
Yeah.
Well they should be some sort of a 

4390
03:00:29,550 --> 03:00:32,430
certification course where they know 
you're competent with the spear,

4391
03:00:32,640 --> 03:00:33,473
you know,
because the spear requires massive 

4392
03:00:34,921 --> 03:00:37,410
physical skills.
You have to be strong as fuck.

4393
03:00:37,620 --> 03:00:40,110
You have to be a person who could throw 
a lot of weight.

4394
03:00:40,470 --> 03:00:42,180
It's not as easy as like pulling a 
trigger.

4395
03:00:42,210 --> 03:00:44,580
There's a lot,
there's a lot of physicality involved in

4396
03:00:44,581 --> 03:00:45,490
killing someone.
Porter,

4397
03:00:45,600 --> 03:00:47,300
I think,
is it gutless think sometimes,

4398
03:00:47,310 --> 03:00:49,050
like you shouldn't just be able to pull 
the trigger.

4399
03:00:49,051 --> 03:00:50,970
You should have to passive hunting.

4400
03:00:51,120 --> 03:00:51,953
I think a hunter safety,
you're shooting aspects should be a 

4401
03:00:54,421 --> 03:00:55,780
little more in depth.
Oh No,

4402
03:00:55,890 --> 03:00:58,500
I don't think you should be able to maim
a fucking animal.

4403
03:00:59,110 --> 03:00:59,880
Yeah,
right.

4404
03:00:59,880 --> 03:01:00,713
Like you should,
you should have to put some groupings 

4405
03:01:01,781 --> 03:01:04,420
together or something.
Handgun or,

4406
03:01:04,421 --> 03:01:07,000
or rifle.
You know you shouldn't be that go gay.

4407
03:01:07,240 --> 03:01:08,440
Yup.
It's not loaded.

4408
03:01:08,470 --> 03:01:12,100
You fucking know how to put the safety 
on and you're 12 go get him.

4409
03:01:12,400 --> 03:01:14,470
Yeah,
I completely agree because when you pass

4410
03:01:14,471 --> 03:01:15,304
one of those hunter safety courses,
what they are as opposed to 10 I was 

4411
03:01:17,720 --> 03:01:20,160
fucking 10 they're easy to pass 
questions.

4412
03:01:20,410 --> 03:01:23,800
You just have to know things and you 
have to get 60% of the questions right.

4413
03:01:23,830 --> 03:01:24,663
Yeah,
that's it.

4414
03:01:25,030 --> 03:01:27,370
It's just going to get a d a d.
Yeah,

4415
03:01:27,520 --> 03:01:31,570
and then have fun with your dad and his 
hunting buddies.

4416
03:01:31,610 --> 03:01:33,070
Yeah.
You don't try and burn.

4417
03:01:33,070 --> 03:01:35,920
One of one of them is trying to fucking 
this this way.

4418
03:01:36,420 --> 03:01:39,970
This is a way to teach people to be 
competent first before you allow them to

4419
03:01:39,971 --> 03:01:41,440
do it.
I think that's probably the best way,

4420
03:01:41,620 --> 03:01:42,453
but then people hear shit like that.
Like you're a fringe and pall mall 

4421
03:01:45,251 --> 03:01:47,620
rides.
I'll teach my son how to do it.

4422
03:01:47,710 --> 03:01:49,390
I hope you do.
I hope you hope we do,

4423
03:01:49,391 --> 03:01:50,860
but if we're going to regulate it at 
all,

4424
03:01:50,861 --> 03:01:53,800
it seems ridiculous to me that you don't
regulate competency.

4425
03:01:54,160 --> 03:01:54,993
Like people should have a certain amount
of ability before they go hunting or 

4426
03:01:57,940 --> 03:02:01,150
before they go and shoot a gun at a 
range and he kind of,

4427
03:02:01,210 --> 03:02:02,810
yeah,
bearing arms.

4428
03:02:02,870 --> 03:02:06,030
Imagine if they just gave you a car,
like a licenses.

4429
03:02:06,040 --> 03:02:09,360
Do you like asking what's the green 
light?

4430
03:02:09,440 --> 03:02:09,791
Yeah,
yeah.

4431
03:02:09,791 --> 03:02:11,600
What do you do when you hit a stop sign 
and you,

4432
03:02:11,601 --> 03:02:13,600
you answer these 60% of these questions,
right?

4433
03:02:13,650 --> 03:02:15,760
So they give you a car and that's how 
you learn.

4434
03:02:15,790 --> 03:02:18,130
You learn by driving out there in the 
public,

4435
03:02:18,131 --> 03:02:19,690
but that's kind of what you're doing 
with guns.

4436
03:02:20,170 --> 03:02:20,800
You know,
he just,

4437
03:02:20,800 --> 03:02:21,633
someone passes a course and then all of 
a sudden they got a gun and they just 

4438
03:02:24,191 --> 03:02:25,450
wandering around like,
you should,

4439
03:02:25,451 --> 03:02:26,690
uh,
you should know how the fuck man,

4440
03:02:26,760 --> 03:02:28,720
and he's the hunting and then your dad's
bay is like,

4441
03:02:28,721 --> 03:02:30,940
it got them on a,
on a four 10.

4442
03:02:30,941 --> 03:02:32,980
Let's give him a 12 gauge.
God dammit.

4443
03:02:33,820 --> 03:02:36,970
Right now you're 10 with a 12 gauge.
Yeah.

4444
03:02:37,930 --> 03:02:40,510
Yeah.
Having fun or a 300 win mag just fucking

4445
03:02:40,511 --> 03:02:41,360
show,
you know,

4446
03:02:41,590 --> 03:02:44,350
a 10 year old with 300 win mag boom 
full.

4447
03:02:44,910 --> 03:02:47,200
You just go flying backwards and land on
your ass.

4448
03:02:47,710 --> 03:02:48,461
Yeah.
It's,

4449
03:02:48,461 --> 03:02:49,720
um,
it's,

4450
03:02:49,721 --> 03:02:52,180
there's a way to do it.
It's like meeting in the middle.

4451
03:02:52,340 --> 03:02:53,173
One of the things about like,
people who are gun rights advocates is 

4452
03:02:55,031 --> 03:02:56,230
they don't want to give up anything.

4453
03:02:56,230 --> 03:02:59,890
And I understand it because they feel 
like if you give up any ground,

4454
03:03:01,770 --> 03:03:02,603
they'll,
liberals are going to come in and 

4455
03:03:04,871 --> 03:03:05,800
they're gonna want to take all your 
guns.

4456
03:03:05,801 --> 03:03:08,080
People who don't have guns don't want 
anybody to have guns.

4457
03:03:08,710 --> 03:03:11,260
And people who have guns want everybody 
to be able to get a gun.

4458
03:03:12,550 --> 03:03:13,383
I think,
I don't know how I'm on the fence on 

4459
03:03:15,551 --> 03:03:16,151
Allen,
but I,

4460
03:03:16,151 --> 03:03:18,130
uh,
I carry a weapon everywhere with me.

4461
03:03:18,430 --> 03:03:19,263
It's what I do.
I have one in every vehicle all over my 

4462
03:03:22,031 --> 03:03:23,560
house.
I,

4463
03:03:23,561 --> 03:03:25,690
uh,
you and Tim Kennedy should get together.

4464
03:03:25,780 --> 03:03:28,330
We do all the time.
We do all this done,

4465
03:03:29,110 --> 03:03:30,310
you know,
and uh,

4466
03:03:31,420 --> 03:03:32,253
I dunno.
I feel like I've never had a pull my 

4467
03:03:34,181 --> 03:03:36,580
weapon ever,
but I feel like if I did,

4468
03:03:36,581 --> 03:03:39,130
I would kill somebody for sure.
If it pushed me to that point.

4469
03:03:39,250 --> 03:03:41,890
If you were in a position where 
someone's going to take your life,

4470
03:03:41,920 --> 03:03:42,753
which happens all the time,
it would be wonderful if you could talk 

4471
03:03:44,891 --> 03:03:46,390
someone out of that without having to 
shoot them.

4472
03:03:46,870 --> 03:03:47,703
But there's a lot of people that don't 
want to believe if the scenario does 

4473
03:03:50,291 --> 03:03:52,240
present itself,
occasionally we got to shoot somebody.

4474
03:03:52,330 --> 03:03:53,560
Absolutely.
Yeah,

4475
03:03:54,040 --> 03:03:56,080
it does.
It does happens all the time.

4476
03:03:56,430 --> 03:03:57,263
He can't control,
there's a giant fucking population on 

4477
03:04:00,171 --> 03:04:01,004
this planet and amongst those people you
are going to run into the wrong 

4478
03:04:03,621 --> 03:04:07,370
motherfucker sometimes,
whether it's some Ted Bundy character or

4479
03:04:07,371 --> 03:04:10,610
there at some fucking school shooter or 
there who knows.

4480
03:04:10,790 --> 03:04:11,623
You just don't know.
And this idea that you shouldn't be 

4481
03:04:13,341 --> 03:04:15,620
prepared and then we should pretend that
those people don't exist.

4482
03:04:16,040 --> 03:04:21,040
That's desk just as unhealthy as a 
someone thinking that everyone should be

4483
03:04:21,561 --> 03:04:22,394
armed everywhere they go.
We should all have guns laying on the 

4484
03:04:23,691 --> 03:04:26,120
table and that's just as unhealthy.
It's all,

4485
03:04:26,150 --> 03:04:27,110
it's all of,
it's crazy.

4486
03:04:27,530 --> 03:04:28,363
Like there's,
there's a lot of people here and we 

4487
03:04:30,861 --> 03:04:33,140
definitely need to work on being nicer 
to each other.

4488
03:04:34,700 --> 03:04:37,580
Be Nice to her.
And maybe an Abra talked about this.

4489
03:04:37,581 --> 03:04:40,430
I think mutual combat should be a thing 
that has allowed,

4490
03:04:40,670 --> 03:04:42,640
that's in Seattle.
You don't get to watch this game.

4491
03:04:42,650 --> 03:04:45,020
Road rage.
I puts me over the edge,

4492
03:04:45,430 --> 03:04:47,570
motherfucker.
I will lose my mind.

4493
03:04:47,571 --> 03:04:49,610
Do you know why that is?
Why that is?

4494
03:04:49,611 --> 03:04:51,080
Yeah.
I road rage exists.

4495
03:04:51,230 --> 03:04:52,063
They've actually done like they've made 
a scientific explanation that actually 

4496
03:04:54,471 --> 03:04:56,600
makes sense.
When you're driving in a car,

4497
03:04:56,660 --> 03:04:58,610
things are happening in Split seconds,
right?

4498
03:04:58,611 --> 03:05:00,620
So you're in that car,
people changing lanes,

4499
03:05:00,621 --> 03:05:03,110
you're moving 60 miles an hour,
which I mean,

4500
03:05:03,111 --> 03:05:04,940
how many feet a second is that you're 
flying by,

4501
03:05:04,941 --> 03:05:07,880
right.
And it requires you to be tuned in.

4502
03:05:08,030 --> 03:05:10,910
Two senses are very tuned in.
And because of that,

4503
03:05:10,911 --> 03:05:13,520
anytime something happens,
you're on red alert.

4504
03:05:13,730 --> 03:05:16,570
So you,
or you're engaging with people on red,

4505
03:05:16,571 --> 03:05:17,404
Oh fuck you.

4506
03:05:17,480 --> 03:05:20,600
Like you're in that car and you're,
you're already so ramped up.

4507
03:05:20,690 --> 03:05:22,640
By the time you get out,
you're like ready to go to war.

4508
03:05:22,760 --> 03:05:26,300
And people that are like normally calm,
they get in those situations and they're

4509
03:05:26,310 --> 03:05:28,490
so fucking ramped up.
So ramped up.

4510
03:05:28,520 --> 03:05:29,630
Yeah,
that's what it is.

4511
03:05:29,990 --> 03:05:31,860
It's,
it's dealing with bullshit.

4512
03:05:31,910 --> 03:05:33,300
Allow it to be done.
It,

4513
03:05:34,190 --> 03:05:36,020
I agree.
Motherfucker want to pull you over.

4514
03:05:36,021 --> 03:05:36,854
You should pull over and figure it out 
and said a pullover and then shoot each 

4515
03:05:39,681 --> 03:05:40,730
other.
Shoot each other.

4516
03:05:40,910 --> 03:05:41,743
Well that there'd be a lot of those 
people honking their horn if you got 

4517
03:05:43,870 --> 03:05:45,110
beat the shit out of somebody.
That's true.

4518
03:05:45,160 --> 03:05:47,090
The big all right.
Maybe not.

4519
03:05:47,091 --> 03:05:48,350
Go ahead.
Go ahead and cut in.

4520
03:05:48,500 --> 03:05:52,140
Talk a lot up until the time the door 
shut and they're standing outside.

4521
03:05:52,150 --> 03:05:52,983
Yeah.
And then maybe they try to talk to way 

4522
03:05:54,351 --> 03:05:56,630
out of it or talk to way out,
you know,

4523
03:05:56,631 --> 03:05:57,680
out of you and scared.

4524
03:05:57,920 --> 03:05:59,630
But um,
there's a state,

4525
03:05:59,631 --> 03:06:00,464
Washington state has a law,
a mutual combat law where you could do 

4526
03:06:03,261 --> 03:06:05,750
it in front of cops.
Do you know that crazy dude,

4527
03:06:05,751 --> 03:06:08,210
Phoenix Jones who's an MMA fighter who,
uh,

4528
03:06:08,510 --> 03:06:09,041
he,
uh,

4529
03:06:09,041 --> 03:06:10,330
I don't know.
You don't know who he is.

4530
03:06:10,790 --> 03:06:13,790
This is a crazy story.
He's a legit MMA fighter.

4531
03:06:13,820 --> 03:06:15,840
Very talented kid.
Um,

4532
03:06:15,860 --> 03:06:17,150
is he carlos?
Full doors,

4533
03:06:17,151 --> 03:06:21,050
brother Phoenix Jones.
Anyway,

4534
03:06:21,170 --> 03:06:25,070
he wears a fucking superhero outfit and 
he goes out and fights crime.

4535
03:06:25,460 --> 03:06:26,410
Real life.
Yeah.

4536
03:06:26,420 --> 03:06:27,253
And there's a video of him was on a 
street fight in front of cops because 

4537
03:06:31,161 --> 03:06:33,080
Washington state,
like you said you want to fight.

4538
03:06:33,081 --> 03:06:33,950
Do you want to fight?
Okay.

4539
03:06:33,951 --> 03:06:35,660
You guys allowed to fight so you can 
smoke pot.

4540
03:06:35,940 --> 03:06:37,610
Yeah.
So this is this,

4541
03:06:37,730 --> 03:06:38,563
this guy,
he's got this outfit on and this dude's 

4542
03:06:40,851 --> 03:06:42,830
talking shit to him.
Is this the,

4543
03:06:42,831 --> 03:06:44,790
um,
do you have any warrior bars?

4544
03:06:45,230 --> 03:06:46,190
I don't,
man.

4545
03:06:46,310 --> 03:06:47,540
I don't.
I got some other shit.

4546
03:06:47,630 --> 03:06:48,463
So the guy talks a bunch of shit and 
then he tries to walk away and the guy 

4547
03:06:52,271 --> 03:06:52,761
was like,
oh,

4548
03:06:52,761 --> 03:06:55,800
you're fucking pussy.
So eventually he wound up fighting.

4549
03:06:55,801 --> 03:06:58,100
This guy's in front of cops.
You had the fight.

4550
03:06:58,110 --> 03:07:00,690
Do you have to find a cop first?
No.

4551
03:07:00,810 --> 03:07:03,600
You get agree upon it,
but the cops won't intervene.

4552
03:07:03,690 --> 03:07:05,610
So you can say this is mutual common.
Yeah.

4553
03:07:05,640 --> 03:07:06,473
So look at this.
There's a cop car so the cops are 

4554
03:07:08,221 --> 03:07:10,440
watching.
This is hilarious by the way.

4555
03:07:10,441 --> 03:07:14,700
This is real fucking recent.
And this dude,

4556
03:07:14,701 --> 03:07:16,460
Phoenix Jones,
whatever his real name.

4557
03:07:16,461 --> 03:07:18,330
So no weapons,
no weapons,

4558
03:07:18,360 --> 03:07:19,770
no evan mutual combat.
Yeah.

4559
03:07:20,760 --> 03:07:21,593
And so the cops let them do it,
see if he can get to the actual fight 

4560
03:07:23,521 --> 03:07:24,354
itself.
Cause it's hilarious with his mother 

4561
03:07:25,951 --> 03:07:28,740
fucking ass leg kicks the shit out of it
right off the bat.

4562
03:07:28,740 --> 03:07:29,521
And the dude's like,
wait,

4563
03:07:29,521 --> 03:07:32,010
what a little bit before that.
Here it goes.

4564
03:07:32,190 --> 03:07:33,440
So they go at it,
we go,

4565
03:07:33,460 --> 03:07:34,560
Ooh,
fuck you.

4566
03:07:34,740 --> 03:07:35,371
He's like,
okay.

4567
03:07:35,371 --> 03:07:36,630
Okay.
He's dressed like a superhero,

4568
03:07:36,631 --> 03:07:38,580
which is even more humiliating.
They kicked your ass.

4569
03:07:38,850 --> 03:07:39,683
So they start going at it.
They're standing there in front of the 

4570
03:07:41,551 --> 03:07:42,384
cops.
Look at this.

4571
03:07:42,720 --> 03:07:43,950
Wow.
Right away.

4572
03:07:44,010 --> 03:07:46,860
Oh leg kick.
And then he's bouncing,

4573
03:07:46,861 --> 03:07:48,270
moving on him and do,
he was like,

4574
03:07:48,271 --> 03:07:49,890
wait,
what wac leg kick again.

4575
03:07:49,920 --> 03:07:54,920
Oh Shit.
I got back and he's bounced it around on

4576
03:07:55,861 --> 03:07:57,600
him.
He's throwing jabs to the body.

4577
03:07:57,630 --> 03:08:00,360
And is that the cop right there to the 
right and watching?

4578
03:08:00,390 --> 03:08:00,931
Yup.
Why?

4579
03:08:00,931 --> 03:08:02,340
Because if it goes to the ground,
it's over.

4580
03:08:02,400 --> 03:08:03,211
I don't know,
man.

4581
03:08:03,211 --> 03:08:06,420
I think in case the guy quits,
I guess if the guy quits,

4582
03:08:06,421 --> 03:08:10,170
the cop has to be there to say,
well then it's a salt.

4583
03:08:10,170 --> 03:08:12,240
After that,
it's no longer mutual combat.

4584
03:08:12,330 --> 03:08:16,050
Like he's just kicking the shit out of 
his leg when we do,

4585
03:08:16,051 --> 03:08:17,970
it's moving forward just in a Zombie 
state.

4586
03:08:17,971 --> 03:08:18,804
Now he doesn't know what the fuck's 
going on and then the beating come down 

4587
03:08:20,701 --> 03:08:22,230
and then the cop step in and separate 
it.

4588
03:08:22,270 --> 03:08:23,011
I say,
okay,

4589
03:08:23,011 --> 03:08:24,110
that's enough.
That's a,

4590
03:08:24,120 --> 03:08:25,830
then they're like,
have a good night.

4591
03:08:25,860 --> 03:08:26,461
Yeah.
Good night,

4592
03:08:26,461 --> 03:08:26,890
sir.
No,

4593
03:08:26,890 --> 03:08:29,430
please don't care.
Exactly no paperwork because doing it in

4594
03:08:29,431 --> 03:08:30,264
front of the cops,
Washington state as some crazy mutual 

4595
03:08:33,631 --> 03:08:34,464
combat law,
how do we get that pass across the 

4596
03:08:35,941 --> 03:08:38,940
board?
It would stop a lot of fucking Jabber,

4597
03:08:38,941 --> 03:08:40,200
John.
Oh my God,

4598
03:08:40,201 --> 03:08:42,690
would it?
Oh Man,

4599
03:08:42,691 --> 03:08:43,524
wait.
It's not a people that say things they 

4600
03:08:44,731 --> 03:08:46,470
don't really mean.
You know,

4601
03:08:46,471 --> 03:08:48,780
and they,
they open up possibilities.

4602
03:08:48,781 --> 03:08:51,510
They don't really want to take place 
because alcohol,

4603
03:08:51,720 --> 03:08:53,010
yeah,
they get froggy.

4604
03:08:53,550 --> 03:08:55,160
Exactly.
Jump.

4605
03:08:55,410 --> 03:08:57,780
Now all of a sudden they got a jump.
Well that's why pots better,

4606
03:08:57,870 --> 03:08:58,703
but because that guy got so froggy,
he actually jumped and he didn't even 

4607
03:09:00,781 --> 03:09:01,614
know how to jump,
which is the most ridiculous thing in 

4608
03:09:03,271 --> 03:09:04,104
front of a cop on camera.
At least you could take an ass whipping 

4609
03:09:07,410 --> 03:09:09,330
description of what happened here is 
kind of interesting.

4610
03:09:09,470 --> 03:09:11,230
Who wrote this?
Just somebody somewhere.

4611
03:09:11,270 --> 03:09:12,540
I think it's whoever shot.
Oh,

4612
03:09:12,541 --> 03:09:16,770
he said F u n word and he was going to 
walk away and leave and the guy said,

4613
03:09:16,771 --> 03:09:17,380
I'll fight you.
Right.

4614
03:09:17,380 --> 03:09:18,213
I'll take it to your house.
And then that's when he went to the 

4615
03:09:19,471 --> 03:09:20,130
Commons.
All right,

4616
03:09:20,130 --> 03:09:21,840
we're going to fight them.
At this point,

4617
03:09:21,841 --> 03:09:25,920
Phoenix agrees to mutual combat the to 
shake hands and the fight commences.

4618
03:09:30,090 --> 03:09:31,800
He says,
fuck you,

4619
03:09:31,980 --> 03:09:33,960
I'll bring this to your house.
Yeah.

4620
03:09:33,990 --> 03:09:35,700
And right before he beats the shit out 
of the dude,

4621
03:09:35,701 --> 03:09:36,570
the dude says,
you know,

4622
03:09:36,571 --> 03:09:38,100
you don't want it up.
None of this.

4623
03:09:42,360 --> 03:09:43,770
Oh,
that's hilarious.

4624
03:09:44,100 --> 03:09:45,030
Yeah.
Combat.

4625
03:09:45,660 --> 03:09:46,493
Yeah.
Well that can only exist in like them 

4626
03:09:48,541 --> 03:09:51,450
wild west dates.
Like you get that off in Arizona,

4627
03:09:51,480 --> 03:09:54,520
maybe New Mexico.
They could pull that off.

4628
03:09:54,820 --> 03:09:55,990
Tell him I'll never make it to 
California,

4629
03:09:56,220 --> 03:09:56,920
California.
Me.

4630
03:09:56,920 --> 03:10:01,160
[inaudible] they'd be like,
we have to stop violence and guns.

4631
03:10:01,170 --> 03:10:03,310
You have any reasonable sides?
Is it both sides?

4632
03:10:03,340 --> 03:10:04,173
Yeah.
We have like a lot of people that came 

4633
03:10:05,261 --> 03:10:10,180
over here to grow sprouts and I don't 
think there's going to be much,

4634
03:10:10,510 --> 03:10:13,210
much mutual down in Compton.
No,

4635
03:10:13,810 --> 03:10:14,650
no,
no.

4636
03:10:14,651 --> 03:10:17,350
The yeah,
they have to learn how to fight first.

4637
03:10:17,620 --> 03:10:19,330
If you don't know how to fight,
that's when the guns come out.

4638
03:10:20,730 --> 03:10:23,980
It's really,
I wonder if mutual combat allows weapons

4639
03:10:23,981 --> 03:10:26,320
if you both have weapons.
No,

4640
03:10:26,321 --> 03:10:28,390
I think that's a,
that's not in the rules.

4641
03:10:28,450 --> 03:10:29,950
It's murder you.
Have you seen that shit?

4642
03:10:29,951 --> 03:10:32,710
They're doing a Russian now.
M ones have a night fights.

4643
03:10:32,890 --> 03:10:33,723
Knife fight night.
Like nights you dress up like a knight 

4644
03:10:35,920 --> 03:10:38,390
armor and swords and Shit.
Fuck it.

4645
03:10:38,680 --> 03:10:39,820
Yeah.
I put it on my twitter.

4646
03:10:39,970 --> 03:10:42,340
I mean we treat it today.
I'll fucking,

4647
03:10:42,540 --> 03:10:45,400
the guy got killed by a sword to the 
face,

4648
03:10:45,430 --> 03:10:46,510
dude.
You got to see this shit.

4649
03:10:46,511 --> 03:10:51,060
They hit each other in the head that 
were in armor outfit Blips,

4650
03:10:51,100 --> 03:10:53,170
heavy pounds.
They're not moving very well.

4651
03:10:53,410 --> 03:10:55,840
I would bet it's heavier than that.
Like,

4652
03:10:55,841 --> 03:10:56,674
look at this.
They're jacking each other with these 

4653
03:10:58,151 --> 03:11:01,600
fucking swords.
They're like modern night.

4654
03:11:01,640 --> 03:11:02,141
Gee.
Oh,

4655
03:11:02,141 --> 03:11:04,210
and the shield to the face.
Well,

4656
03:11:04,211 --> 03:11:05,050
there's some,
uh,

4657
03:11:05,080 --> 03:11:07,090
full speed versions of it,
Jamie,

4658
03:11:07,480 --> 03:11:09,580
where they look out there whacking each 
other,

4659
03:11:09,581 --> 03:11:10,450
man.
I mean,

4660
03:11:10,451 --> 03:11:12,100
they got a blunt sword,
you think?

4661
03:11:12,130 --> 03:11:14,380
I think so.
I think they're probably blunt,

4662
03:11:14,590 --> 03:11:17,140
but they're big in the legs.
Behind the legs is not,

4663
03:11:17,470 --> 03:11:20,130
oh,
we need ladies in Guardian.

4664
03:11:20,131 --> 03:11:22,420
I'd be going for all of this.
You got to take down,

4665
03:11:22,630 --> 03:11:23,530
take down.
I mean,

4666
03:11:23,531 --> 03:11:24,490
this is real.
I mean,

4667
03:11:24,491 --> 03:11:26,080
this would be real life if that would 
happen.

4668
03:11:26,960 --> 03:11:27,910
Oh,
shielding him.

4669
03:11:27,911 --> 03:11:29,490
Lay down.
Oh my gosh.

4670
03:11:29,491 --> 03:11:30,760
She yelled at him in the head.

4671
03:11:33,070 --> 03:11:34,510
No,
I guess they stopped it.

4672
03:11:34,540 --> 03:11:36,160
He did on his own.
He was like,

4673
03:11:36,161 --> 03:11:37,750
okay.
Oh my God,

4674
03:11:37,751 --> 03:11:38,720
Dad.
Yeah.

4675
03:11:39,570 --> 03:11:40,360
Well,
they've got a good job.

4676
03:11:40,360 --> 03:11:42,070
He's trying to tap on the ground.
He's done.

4677
03:11:42,520 --> 03:11:43,840
Wow.
Man,

4678
03:11:43,930 --> 03:11:44,763
that is crazy.
There's no rule where they're finding 

4679
03:11:46,301 --> 03:11:47,990
what's awesome too.
Yeah.

4680
03:11:48,010 --> 03:11:50,170
They're going to get there in a field.
Yeah.

4681
03:11:50,171 --> 03:11:52,510
It looks like a place where people would
fight with swords.

4682
03:11:53,020 --> 03:11:54,510
The Shire.
Aw.

4683
03:11:54,850 --> 03:11:56,170
Hell yes.
Look it up.

4684
03:11:56,320 --> 03:11:58,030
Look at his face to meet up.
Oh yeah,

4685
03:11:58,031 --> 03:11:59,590
man.
He took some sorts of the head.

4686
03:12:00,580 --> 03:12:03,730
That is a fucked up sport.
That's a tough dude right there.

4687
03:12:03,880 --> 03:12:05,560
This is next level shit,
right?

4688
03:12:05,561 --> 03:12:07,330
I mean this was,
sign me up.

4689
03:12:08,260 --> 03:12:10,080
I don't even know how to yield to soar.
Bell duty.

4690
03:12:10,081 --> 03:12:11,160
You.
And if so,

4691
03:12:11,170 --> 03:12:13,150
if this starts happening in the United 
States,

4692
03:12:13,151 --> 03:12:14,800
you're down.
Look,

4693
03:12:14,801 --> 03:12:15,634
what the fuck.

4694
03:12:17,700 --> 03:12:18,710
Come on.
Five sweat.

4695
03:12:20,110 --> 03:12:22,200
Oh my God.
This is the second ax.

4696
03:12:22,930 --> 03:12:24,810
Oh my God.
Look how big that guy is.

4697
03:12:26,640 --> 03:12:28,500
I don't want even want to hear it.
Oh he has.

4698
03:12:29,130 --> 03:12:31,120
He has a real life acts.
Well this,

4699
03:12:31,140 --> 03:12:32,460
this is the only way to fight it out 
with the act.

4700
03:12:32,490 --> 03:12:33,880
Grabbed my all.
What?

4701
03:12:35,710 --> 03:12:39,820
Oh Shit.
This is instead he killed that dude.

4702
03:12:39,910 --> 03:12:42,250
He hit that too.
Fucking x.

4703
03:12:42,251 --> 03:12:46,200
What do you look up for this so people 
can fucking do this fight.

4704
03:12:46,750 --> 03:12:51,680
I am Cf.
I am c f 2015 five on five France versus

4705
03:12:51,681 --> 03:12:53,510
New Zealand.
They have night fights.

4706
03:12:53,810 --> 03:12:54,643
This is a new day.
Had those guys had axes and macy's and 

4707
03:12:57,621 --> 03:13:00,200
they hit a hit that dude in the head 
with the ax seven times.

4708
03:13:00,230 --> 03:13:01,063
Yeah,
right.

4709
03:13:02,060 --> 03:13:04,160
He's dead.
What the fuck?

4710
03:13:04,161 --> 03:13:08,510
Cowboy man,
he got in trouble there because he's put

4711
03:13:08,511 --> 03:13:09,650
the blade,
that dude's throat,

4712
03:13:10,050 --> 03:13:10,883
you know,
you know allowed to do that jump kick 

4713
03:13:12,260 --> 03:13:13,550
and then put it to his throat.

4714
03:13:13,790 --> 03:13:15,080
Oh my God,
I can't do that.

4715
03:13:15,110 --> 03:13:15,531
He said,
dude,

4716
03:13:15,531 --> 03:13:19,640
you can seriously cut his head off.
The referee stopped too violent.

4717
03:13:20,090 --> 03:13:20,923
Yeah,
but the guy who long before two dudes 

4718
03:13:22,520 --> 03:13:26,620
dress up and Samurai outfits with no 
fucking armor and go at it.

4719
03:13:27,550 --> 03:13:28,383
How?
How can you take an ax to the head six 

4720
03:13:30,021 --> 03:13:31,340
times?
You can't.

4721
03:13:31,370 --> 03:13:34,220
Obviously one guy went down like,
yeah,

4722
03:13:34,221 --> 03:13:35,870
but I mean how can is that?
There's no blood.

4723
03:13:35,900 --> 03:13:38,560
Look at the cause of his helmet.
I want the mace look.

4724
03:13:38,970 --> 03:13:41,890
This is so crazy.
Fighting for points to and says,

4725
03:13:42,550 --> 03:13:44,510
God,
you can't stab.

4726
03:13:44,511 --> 03:13:47,510
I haven't seen any stabbing going on 
because I feel like that'd be my move.

4727
03:13:47,540 --> 03:13:48,373
Well,
here's what's unrealistic about it in 

4728
03:13:49,311 --> 03:13:52,520
the real world and if the two on one 
like this,

4729
03:13:52,521 --> 03:13:54,320
they would be stabbing each other for 
sure.

4730
03:13:54,321 --> 03:13:55,460
His fights,
it'd be quicker.

4731
03:13:55,670 --> 03:13:56,503
So like there's something about like 
using these blunt objects and not being 

4732
03:13:59,901 --> 03:14:00,830
able to stab each other.

4733
03:14:00,950 --> 03:14:03,260
That makes it almost more ridiculously 
brutal.

4734
03:14:04,250 --> 03:14:07,610
This is a crazy fuck how big that is.
That's the mountain.

4735
03:14:08,540 --> 03:14:11,090
This is awesome.
They tackle each other,

4736
03:14:11,600 --> 03:14:13,130
I think when you're down,
you're down.

4737
03:14:13,160 --> 03:14:14,480
Yeah.
He seems confident.

4738
03:14:14,510 --> 03:14:16,460
I wouldn't be confident if I was in the 
war.

4739
03:14:16,461 --> 03:14:18,230
I'd be,
that guy was to stab me in the Dick.

4740
03:14:18,530 --> 03:14:21,800
I got to get up now.
How crazy would warby,

4741
03:14:21,810 --> 03:14:26,690
how fucking crazy would old time,
warby old time barbarian style sword,

4742
03:14:26,691 --> 03:14:28,100
sword,
macy's.

4743
03:14:28,390 --> 03:14:29,740
Like if you're the guy and you're 
choosing,

4744
03:14:29,760 --> 03:14:31,810
what would you be your weapon?
So I'm like,

4745
03:14:32,430 --> 03:14:33,263
oh,
for sure.

4746
03:14:33,390 --> 03:14:34,880
For sure.
Sit on the rate.

4747
03:14:35,160 --> 03:14:36,370
Yeah.
Yeah.

4748
03:14:36,590 --> 03:14:37,880
Imagine being the guy like,
Yep.

4749
03:14:38,330 --> 03:14:39,163
Grabbing your macy's just like you.
You walk into the onnit academy in your 

4750
03:14:41,571 --> 03:14:42,404
life.
10 1220 or the fucking three headed 30 

4751
03:14:46,641 --> 03:14:49,340
pounder and you're like,
that's mine.

4752
03:14:49,790 --> 03:14:51,410
What do you have six good swings out of?

4753
03:14:51,410 --> 03:14:52,430
Yeah,
maybe.

4754
03:14:52,610 --> 03:14:53,443
Especially if your guy doesn't train and
they weren't really trained in that 

4755
03:14:55,580 --> 03:14:56,413
month and then you're fatigued and dying
and some dude's cutting your head off 

4756
03:15:00,400 --> 03:15:01,620
and you get to see that sword right when
it,

4757
03:15:01,800 --> 03:15:04,340
when it hits your neck,
but a man went to the actual life.

4758
03:15:04,341 --> 03:15:06,380
You're six,
you're six good.

4759
03:15:06,680 --> 03:15:08,970
You're,
you're lifting people off their feet.

4760
03:15:09,130 --> 03:15:14,130
This Nicholas 21 versus 21 tiny pig pin.
They have men.

4761
03:15:17,340 --> 03:15:21,020
So you s is here.
Oh my God.

4762
03:15:21,290 --> 03:15:23,900
Battle of the nations.
It's called and I hate to tell you,

4763
03:15:23,901 --> 03:15:24,734
but I just don't think the US is going 
to do very well now against the 

4764
03:15:25,911 --> 03:15:26,930
Russians.
Well,

4765
03:15:26,931 --> 03:15:30,620
I mean I just don't,
I just don't know of us has much night.

4766
03:15:31,520 --> 03:15:33,720
Jesus Christ.
Lynch's dewey.

4767
03:15:33,850 --> 03:15:34,683
No,
we don't see when the age of 19 zero 

4768
03:15:36,141 --> 03:15:37,730
right Arrow,
but does Russia,

4769
03:15:38,220 --> 03:15:43,220
they ever lineage and knighting the 
Scottish or the English team?

4770
03:15:44,180 --> 03:15:46,130
Yeah,
they write braveheart style.

4771
03:15:46,320 --> 03:15:49,860
Our style for sure wins every year.
I mean,

4772
03:15:50,040 --> 03:15:50,873
when you look at mma and how crazy Emma 
May as in comparison to boxing and how 

4773
03:15:54,091 --> 03:15:54,924
people have embraced it,
this is like if they've figured out a 

4774
03:15:58,561 --> 03:16:01,620
way to regrow limbs,
if they figured out a way,

4775
03:16:01,621 --> 03:16:03,870
like we're 100% if you get your arm cut 
off,

4776
03:16:04,050 --> 03:16:07,260
they can grow that bitch back.
People are doing this,

4777
03:16:07,261 --> 03:16:10,350
man,
you can't regrow your heart back or your

4778
03:16:10,351 --> 03:16:11,184
head.
It's true.

4779
03:16:11,190 --> 03:16:12,330
It's,
you can't stab in the heart.

4780
03:16:12,450 --> 03:16:13,850
Can't cut their head off,
but you can come down.

4781
03:16:14,370 --> 03:16:16,680
That'd be like a three point stance.
Yes or no.

4782
03:16:16,800 --> 03:16:18,840
No kicks in the Dick.
That'd be,

4783
03:16:18,841 --> 03:16:19,720
you can't,
no,

4784
03:16:20,450 --> 03:16:22,710
no,
no heart piercing and no head shopping.

4785
03:16:22,730 --> 03:16:23,940
Yeah,
that would be the rules.

4786
03:16:24,300 --> 03:16:25,133
But you can cut a guy's arm off and they
immediately seal it up real quick and 

4787
03:16:27,391 --> 03:16:28,530
they rushed him to the hospital.

4788
03:16:28,560 --> 03:16:32,670
You won by Kao cut his arm off or can 
you still fight?

4789
03:16:32,671 --> 03:16:33,504
You grow a new arm.
And a couple of weeks later he's at the 

4790
03:16:35,101 --> 03:16:36,690
press conference,
a little baby arm.

4791
03:16:36,810 --> 03:16:37,890
He's like,
fuck cowboy.

4792
03:16:38,130 --> 03:16:39,530
You know,
next time what?

4793
03:16:39,540 --> 03:16:41,940
Sue's my arm goes back,
I'm gonna kick his ass right now.

4794
03:16:41,941 --> 03:16:43,630
I got a little baby arm.
This motherfucker,

4795
03:16:43,690 --> 03:16:46,940
you getting bigger every day.
I'm taking steps on rollback.

4796
03:16:47,000 --> 03:16:50,330
You can come back to big or,
yeah,

4797
03:16:50,560 --> 03:16:52,050
it's,
I think it's like a sprout.

4798
03:16:52,080 --> 03:16:53,820
It's how it has some salad.
It has them girl,

4799
03:16:54,060 --> 03:16:56,820
and then it has to stretch out and grow.
Yeah.

4800
03:16:56,850 --> 03:17:00,330
That's what I would think along the way.
Like all alligator arm,

4801
03:17:00,690 --> 03:17:02,310
like an alligator doesn't just grow a 
goal.

4802
03:17:02,340 --> 03:17:06,200
The whole thing just just pop out.
They start slowly.

4803
03:17:06,210 --> 03:17:06,970
They regrow.
There's,

4804
03:17:06,970 --> 03:17:07,720
yeah,
they were grow.

4805
03:17:07,720 --> 03:17:08,553
There's no,
she,

4806
03:17:08,560 --> 03:17:11,040
I didn't know that Gary asked fuckers 
gainers.

4807
03:17:11,160 --> 03:17:14,250
There's a scary lizards regrow their 
legs.

4808
03:17:14,370 --> 03:17:15,870
Wow.
I got a little gators.

4809
03:17:15,871 --> 03:17:16,800
I call it those.
My friends,

4810
03:17:16,801 --> 03:17:17,634
they call them gators.
Hang out on the boat and eat all the 

4811
03:17:19,651 --> 03:17:21,150
food,
drink all the alcohol,

4812
03:17:21,151 --> 03:17:23,220
and it comes when it comes time to fill 
out bitch up,

4813
03:17:23,250 --> 03:17:24,870
there's little arms.
Can't reach their wallets.

4814
03:17:25,020 --> 03:17:25,850
Oh,
those kinds of,

4815
03:17:25,850 --> 03:17:27,480
that's like t rex arms,
the gators.

4816
03:17:27,510 --> 03:17:29,910
But you can't make shoes out of them.
But I was cool.

4817
03:17:30,320 --> 03:17:33,180
That was cool at all.
The gators day gators.

4818
03:17:33,181 --> 03:17:34,830
When I was a kid,
I used to live in Florida.

4819
03:17:34,831 --> 03:17:37,850
We lived near a lake.
Alice in Gainesville and uh,

4820
03:17:37,950 --> 03:17:39,720
alligators were endangered when I was a 
kid.

4821
03:17:40,590 --> 03:17:41,423
Yeah.
Like they were telling people not to 

4822
03:17:42,241 --> 03:17:44,940
feed them because people throw 
marshmallows and the water.

4823
03:17:45,000 --> 03:17:46,860
Why did you like marshmallows so much?
I don't know.

4824
03:17:46,920 --> 03:17:47,753
They love him though.
And the gators would eat the 

4825
03:17:48,721 --> 03:17:49,860
marshmallow,
but it was cool to do.

4826
03:17:49,860 --> 03:17:50,693
We would get marshmallows and throw them
in the water and then they started 

4827
03:17:51,901 --> 03:17:52,734
telling you can't do it.
They don't digest them well like these 

4828
03:17:54,781 --> 03:17:56,190
are in danger.
We have to take care of them.

4829
03:17:56,370 --> 03:17:57,203
And then from then on they just slowly 
but surely overwhelmed to the point 

4830
03:18:01,321 --> 03:18:01,891
where like,
okay,

4831
03:18:01,891 --> 03:18:04,680
you can hunt them,
can shoot 500 of them a year.

4832
03:18:04,950 --> 03:18:09,950
Like they have tags were 500 alligators 
can get killed by one dude.

4833
03:18:10,560 --> 03:18:13,020
500 500 that's some serious hunting.
Yeah.

4834
03:18:13,021 --> 03:18:14,670
That's some serious one and a half a 
day.

4835
03:18:14,690 --> 03:18:16,080
Yeah.
Every day.

4836
03:18:16,170 --> 03:18:17,280
Well,
they only have a season,

4837
03:18:17,310 --> 03:18:18,840
so they're doing way more than one a 
day,

4838
03:18:19,080 --> 03:18:21,480
but they do an all bunch of different 
ways of doing lines.

4839
03:18:21,600 --> 03:18:24,900
They put they date,
they swallow a hook.

4840
03:18:24,901 --> 03:18:26,190
Is that what's going on?
And then they're just,

4841
03:18:26,340 --> 03:18:27,720
and the thrash around you shoot him in 
the head.

4842
03:18:27,750 --> 03:18:28,430
Right,
but they're,

4843
03:18:28,430 --> 03:18:30,750
they're essentially on a hook in their 
belly.

4844
03:18:30,780 --> 03:18:32,700
Exactly.
You ever see swamp people?

4845
03:18:32,730 --> 03:18:33,563
I do,
but I just didn't ever grasp like the 

4846
03:18:34,621 --> 03:18:36,270
hook him in the mouth or it's in their 
gut.

4847
03:18:36,330 --> 03:18:38,790
It's sometimes to the mouth.
It's like fishing sometimes.

4848
03:18:38,850 --> 03:18:42,240
I mean if you have a,
a line for a catfish,

4849
03:18:42,480 --> 03:18:43,313
you lay out a line.
Like a lot of times you'll catch them 

4850
03:18:45,001 --> 03:18:47,440
though they're barely hooked.
Sometimes you catch and it's hooked.

4851
03:18:47,441 --> 03:18:48,730
They're hooked deep.
So they,

4852
03:18:48,731 --> 03:18:49,564
that's the same thing they do.
And then they pull them in and they 

4853
03:18:51,281 --> 03:18:53,350
shoot them,
but they can shoot 500 of this.

4854
03:18:53,351 --> 03:18:55,810
I was watching that swamp people show 
and they were,

4855
03:18:55,811 --> 03:18:59,380
the guy had a tag limit of 500 
alligators.

4856
03:18:59,410 --> 03:19:01,930
What is a a gator pay?
It's a good question.

4857
03:19:02,220 --> 03:19:03,053
And what do they do with the gator 
besides make bitching ass boots for me 

4858
03:19:05,020 --> 03:19:06,430
then make bitch ass boots for you.

4859
03:19:06,760 --> 03:19:08,650
They make a,
I mean to eat gator belt.

4860
03:19:08,651 --> 03:19:09,484
Yes.
Apparently it's the highest in protein 

4861
03:19:12,250 --> 03:19:13,083
[inaudible] Papa dose.
And then you can get an appetizer 

4862
03:19:16,510 --> 03:19:18,940
alligator,
but you're getting some frozen bullshit,

4863
03:19:18,970 --> 03:19:21,680
which you really want to do apparently 
according to all the New Mexico,

4864
03:19:21,690 --> 03:19:22,523
I think it's fresh alligator.
But my friend John Dudley is the 

4865
03:19:25,170 --> 03:19:26,003
alligator hunter.
He hunts alligators occasionally and he 

4866
03:19:27,701 --> 03:19:30,220
shoots with a bow and Arrow and he says,
uh,

4867
03:19:30,250 --> 03:19:32,250
that they're delicious.
If you get the,

4868
03:19:32,251 --> 03:19:35,080
the gator tail like right after the or 
dies,

4869
03:19:35,110 --> 03:19:36,730
it's delicious.
It's super lean.

4870
03:19:36,880 --> 03:19:37,713
You don't Cook it very long.
It's like one of those things that you 

4871
03:19:39,131 --> 03:19:40,050
cook it like,
you know,

4872
03:19:40,110 --> 03:19:41,350
like you,
uh,

4873
03:19:41,650 --> 03:19:43,930
I guess you'd have to cook pork.
I don't know.

4874
03:19:43,931 --> 03:19:46,270
I wonder if they get tricker gnosis like
a pig does.

4875
03:19:46,510 --> 03:19:49,570
That's a good question.
I'm sure they live in a nasty swamp.

4876
03:19:49,720 --> 03:19:51,580
Yeah.
But I wonder if they're like susceptible

4877
03:19:51,581 --> 03:19:53,140
to it.
Cause like when they eat it,

4878
03:19:53,141 --> 03:19:53,974
I wonder if their body breaks it down in
the same way our body does or a pig's 

4879
03:19:56,051 --> 03:19:59,620
body does or a or a bear or even a 
mountain lion.

4880
03:19:59,800 --> 03:20:01,750
That's where all the cases a trick and 
osis come from.

4881
03:20:02,590 --> 03:20:04,120
But when they,
uh,

4882
03:20:04,150 --> 03:20:05,830
they do that,
apparently it's delicious.

4883
03:20:05,860 --> 03:20:08,130
We take a,
an alligator freshly killed alligator.

4884
03:20:08,131 --> 03:20:11,920
It's supposed to be real and super high 
protein higher than even like Moose.

4885
03:20:12,330 --> 03:20:14,470
Really higher than Bison.
Higher than anything.

4886
03:20:16,580 --> 03:20:19,360
Supposed to be good.
500 a tag.

4887
03:20:19,480 --> 03:20:21,640
And how many tags are given out?
I don't know.

4888
03:20:21,641 --> 03:20:23,410
It's a good question,
but I to get rid of them.

4889
03:20:23,440 --> 03:20:25,900
It's their 10 guys with 500 a piece or 
is there,

4890
03:20:25,990 --> 03:20:26,740
I mean,
what's the,

4891
03:20:26,740 --> 03:20:28,120
it's a good question.
I don't know,

4892
03:20:28,150 --> 03:20:31,870
but I know that there's a surplus.
There's too many alligators.

4893
03:20:32,080 --> 03:20:33,070
Like they,
they're everywhere.

4894
03:20:33,071 --> 03:20:34,630
Whenever I'm down wakeboarding in 
Florida,

4895
03:20:34,631 --> 03:20:35,980
I see him all the time in the water 
with,

4896
03:20:35,981 --> 03:20:40,210
it's like God dammit.
Gattard did you see that one video where

4897
03:20:40,211 --> 03:20:43,510
that fucking gator walked on the golf 
course and it's a 15 footer.

4898
03:20:44,160 --> 03:20:45,130
Fucking,
you've seen it.

4899
03:20:45,131 --> 03:20:46,960
We can't show it because those fucking 
people,

4900
03:20:47,050 --> 03:20:47,883
they got my facebook pulled down.
Whoever owns that gators putting that 

4901
03:20:50,651 --> 03:20:54,190
video on why he claimed it was their 
video or saw it didn't link to a youtube

4902
03:20:54,191 --> 03:20:58,450
video or something while that's why 
they're trying to make money off of it.

4903
03:20:58,780 --> 03:20:59,650
We'll look at,
we can see it.

4904
03:20:59,651 --> 03:21:01,930
Look at that thing walking across the 
golf course.

4905
03:21:01,931 --> 03:21:05,760
Look how big that is.
That's the gate of the book.

4906
03:21:06,130 --> 03:21:06,963
It's so huge and you get it into 
perspective when the guy comes into 

4907
03:21:09,281 --> 03:21:10,114
focus in a little bit,
cause the guys filming this and a few 

4908
03:21:12,820 --> 03:21:14,590
minutes to dude walks out and see now 
you get,

4909
03:21:14,591 --> 03:21:16,950
you understand how big it is when you 
see that guy in front.

4910
03:21:16,970 --> 03:21:19,630
I understood how big he and literally 
walked past the huge sand trap.

4911
03:21:19,700 --> 03:21:20,533
Look how tall he is too.
That's what's weird was like how long 

4912
03:21:22,841 --> 03:21:25,630
their legs are.
He didn't and he hangs out at whole nine

4913
03:21:25,631 --> 03:21:30,040
in the fucking in a little pond.
Florida is so fucked up dude.

4914
03:21:30,041 --> 03:21:31,940
Look how big he is.
How old are those?

4915
03:21:32,270 --> 03:21:35,890
Oh it's gotta be an old alligator.
Wow.

4916
03:21:35,950 --> 03:21:39,370
I don't know how old he is,
but he's been eating a lot of dogs.

4917
03:21:39,490 --> 03:21:41,320
Wow.
Yeah.

4918
03:21:42,400 --> 03:21:44,470
Yeah.
I would eat that.

4919
03:21:44,740 --> 03:21:46,140
You need fuck.
Yeah.

4920
03:21:46,141 --> 03:21:47,930
How do you kill a gator?
Shoot him in the head.

4921
03:21:47,960 --> 03:21:49,190
You got to shoot him in the head.
Head shot.

4922
03:21:49,220 --> 03:21:50,690
Yeah.
It's got to literally be,

4923
03:21:50,691 --> 03:21:53,030
there's a very small area you're 
shooting at too,

4924
03:21:53,270 --> 03:21:55,880
like right behind the eyes with a bow 
and arrow.

4925
03:21:56,090 --> 03:21:56,923
You could do it.
Yeah,

4926
03:21:56,940 --> 03:21:57,770
same.
Same.

4927
03:21:57,770 --> 03:21:59,120
Yeah.
That one though,

4928
03:21:59,360 --> 03:22:00,620
man.
God Damn.

4929
03:22:00,740 --> 03:22:02,880
There's another angle on them.
Look how big he is.

4930
03:22:02,881 --> 03:22:05,390
His mouth.
Just look at it's fucking tail.

4931
03:22:05,630 --> 03:22:08,480
I mean it doesn't even look real.
Like if that was in a movie,

4932
03:22:08,481 --> 03:22:09,650
you'd be like,
fuck that.

4933
03:22:09,651 --> 03:22:11,060
That's not real.
Lake placid.

4934
03:22:11,090 --> 03:22:11,923
That's the little class it alligator.
How much does he need to eat to sustain 

4935
03:22:16,130 --> 03:22:17,990
that little walk he's doing?
Oh my God.

4936
03:22:17,991 --> 03:22:18,824
I would imagine two dogs today.
I imagine they eat a lot of fucking 

4937
03:22:21,141 --> 03:22:22,010
thought he'd done that.

4938
03:22:22,010 --> 03:22:22,843
Was it game over sun and lays out what 
the fuck closest guy get up to this 

4939
03:22:26,690 --> 03:22:30,980
insane people are living right next to 
dinosaurs.

4940
03:22:31,070 --> 03:22:34,730
That's a fucking dinosaur tail on that 
thing.

4941
03:22:34,760 --> 03:22:36,290
Mine.
God,

4942
03:22:36,770 --> 03:22:39,050
that is an insane animal.
What do you think?

4943
03:22:39,350 --> 03:22:41,090
15 feet does it say?
Yeah.

4944
03:22:41,091 --> 03:22:44,240
They said it's 1515.
They estimated wow.

4945
03:22:44,390 --> 03:22:46,490
Easily 15 feet.
It's an enormous,

4946
03:22:46,980 --> 03:22:50,840
that's the high end.
I was like the 1% or of alligators.

4947
03:22:50,841 --> 03:22:52,430
Yeah,
that's impressive.

4948
03:22:53,090 --> 03:22:55,730
Let's bring this bitch home.
Donald Cowboy cerrone.

4949
03:22:55,850 --> 03:22:57,650
So I think we've worked out a few 
things.

4950
03:22:57,680 --> 03:22:58,780
We have one,
uh,

4951
03:22:59,000 --> 03:23:01,670
one 70 stay at 170 pounds.
Uh,

4952
03:23:01,671 --> 03:23:02,504
I'm the new manager and then we'll go 
straight from me to Chris Brown to DMT 

4953
03:23:07,050 --> 03:23:08,210
dmt.
That's important.

4954
03:23:08,660 --> 03:23:10,490
And a America,
America,

4955
03:23:10,580 --> 03:23:12,230
but tell Budweiser,
relax.

4956
03:23:12,570 --> 03:23:17,570
Um,
don't eat this any mansion as well.

4957
03:23:18,410 --> 03:23:22,460
Definitely don't swallow that.
It's don't be scared of oysters.

4958
03:23:25,220 --> 03:23:27,020
Other than that,
I think we covered it.

4959
03:23:27,350 --> 03:23:28,910
We got it.
This is fun,

4960
03:23:28,911 --> 03:23:30,080
man.
We got to do this more often.

4961
03:23:30,110 --> 03:23:31,480
Hey,
how'd a great fucking time,

4962
03:23:32,390 --> 03:23:34,520
Donald Cowboy Cerrone,
ladies and gentlemen,

4963
03:23:34,550 --> 03:23:36,680
you can catch them on twitter.
Cowboy cerrone,

4964
03:23:36,681 --> 03:23:40,160
catch him on Instagram,
cowboy serone and an x five,

4965
03:23:40,161 --> 03:23:43,880
two oh five [inaudible] square guard.
Is that what's going to happen?

4966
03:23:43,881 --> 03:23:45,200
For sure.
Is that all?

4967
03:23:45,630 --> 03:23:47,100
Well,
we'll be able to tonight,

4968
03:23:47,690 --> 03:23:50,570
allegedly exactly what it is,
but it's going to be epic,

4969
03:23:50,900 --> 03:23:52,370
epic,
epic.

4970
03:23:52,880 --> 03:23:53,480
Thank you,
brother.

4971
03:23:53,480 --> 03:23:54,560
It was awesome.
I enjoyed it.

4972
03:23:54,650 --> 03:23:56,000
We add a here.
Goodnight everybody

4973
03:23:59,150 --> 03:24:03,180
[inaudible]

4974
03:24:07,740 --> 03:24:08,430
okay.

4975
03:24:08,430 --> 03:24:09,263
Hm.
