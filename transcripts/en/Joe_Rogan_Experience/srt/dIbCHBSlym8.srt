What's the recipe?

32
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,940
I don't know the fuck recipe.

33
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:52,080
The recipe is that,

34
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:52,411

35
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:55,890
I got a text from Brian in
capital letters do not eat.

36
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:57,870
Joey Diaz is banana bread.

37
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,640
Nobody asked me that.

38
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,750
You still eat the banana bread?

39
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,240
I haven't even banana breadth is Yoshi.

40
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,083
Oh deed.

41
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,211
But before that,

42
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:03,631
the one day,

43
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:06,300
I hate the sliced and I
was fucking driving home.

44
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,950
I didn't know where the fuck I was

45
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,070
eating the banana bread too.

46
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:11,731
I like to,

47
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:13,350
I go to the weed store and the guy goes,

48
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,310
uh,

49
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,690
we owe you a piece of banana bread.

50
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,610
So it has chocolate chips in it.

51
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:18,120
So if you,

52
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,560
if you're leaving the fucking car,

53
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,120
the chocolate chips on Melton.

54
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:22,050
I wasn't going home.

55
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,910
So here's the beauty of it.

56
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:24,311
I had a,

57
00:01:24,311 --> 00:01:25,480
a soup attire.

58
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,131
Okay.

59
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:27,840
I had a meeting at CBS Radford.

60
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:28,921
Okay.

61
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:30,090
So I hate the fucking thing.

62
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,580
And I,

63
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,470
my CBS,

64
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,160
oh,

65
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,471
the way,

66
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:35,251
the CBS,

67
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:35,491
I go,

68
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:40,491
let me eat the rest of this fucking
fucking melt in my car driving.

69
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,010
I get to the fucking CBS told
me for the lady and the guy,

70
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:44,791
and they're talking to me.

71
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:45,990
And while it's not talking to them,

72
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,060
it's fucking getting hot.

73
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,440
And I'm talking to them and they
can tell something's wrong by Joe.

74
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,530
Are you okay with the lights on?

75
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,300
And I'm like,

76
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,080
yeah,

77
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,621
I'm alright.

78
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:56,340
I'm alright.

79
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,010
And that pitch in this show
and how it's going to be great.

80
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,690
You're going to be great for the show.

81
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:01,000
And I'm like,

82
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,711
this is going to be great,

83
00:02:01,711 --> 00:02:02,280
but listen,

84
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,113
I got to go.

85
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,560
You don't when people want to talk,

86
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:05,500
but you got to go with it.

87
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:06,630
Right?

88
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,690
So for some reason I got in the
car and there was so much traffic.

89
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,200
I went from Laurel Canyon
Rafford the van eyes,

90
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,300
cause I couldn't make a right turn,

91
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,131
right?

92
00:02:16,131 --> 00:02:19,860
Do you understand me guys as
dirty years smoked the weed,

93
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,070
heroin every day.

94
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,890
I couldn't make a right turn.

95
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:24,660
I kept thinking that I
was not go off a cliff.

96
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,080
So finally I can make the right turn and
I'm taking my shirt off at this point.

97
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:30,601
At this point,

98
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:32,070
I'm down to a Guinea tee shirt.

99
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,570
The sunroof was open,

100
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,531
the windows are open,

101
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:37,380
I got the eblast and finally after we
realize it's going to make a right,

102
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:38,091
there's a right channel.

103
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,860
Right now I'm driving on sheet number.

104
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,703
Finally,

105
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,930
I'm fucking hot and I
need something to drink,

106
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:44,850
but I'm cutting stone to
get out of the fucking car.

107
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,871
So what do I do?

108
00:02:45,871 --> 00:02:49,680
I look in the backseat and there's an
old water bottle that's probably 90

109
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:50,461
fucking degrees.

110
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,640
You know those hot water I
pulled over and drag the,

111
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,910
Oh,

112
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,610
with that.

113
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,490
It gives you estrogen.

114
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,410
I don't give a fuck what it
gives me with that though.

115
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,280
The coming out of my
fucking four eggs yesterday,

116
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,860
my tits are getting home.

117
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,860
Get out of the car
right there on chairman.

118
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,760
I just started puking and it's all gone.

119
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,450
Just chumps agreed.

120
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,433
Your body's broken.

121
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:14,643
Broken me.

122
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,240
I fucking said I got back in the car,

123
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:17,820
Lloyd,

124
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,653
if you get me home,

125
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,910
I've never been of the bread.

126
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:22,290
I'll never eat a fucking banana.

127
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,360
I'll never did go to the zoo.

128
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,231
I got home.

129
00:03:25,231 --> 00:03:26,064
I ran upstairs.

130
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,350
I just lay on the couch naked on the,

131
00:03:28,351 --> 00:03:29,910
I forget what my wife
walked in and she's like,

132
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:30,241
Whoa,

133
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:30,931
what happened to you?

134
00:03:30,931 --> 00:03:31,111
I go,

135
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:31,711
don't even ask.

136
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,430
She just,

137
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,570
she knew she could.

138
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:34,460
She keep fucking around with.

139
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,880
I see you back there.

140
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,470
He knew it was going to
that you think about jelly.

141
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,270
Jelly was over my podcast.

142
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:44,910
Once we do with the podcast
as a podcast started,

143
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,440
he just starts eating this cookie.

144
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,050
The body of Christ compels you.

145
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,000
I overdosed the other day.

146
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:52,620
Jeff heard what happened,

147
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,660
can eat that whole thing or you're
fuck you fuck you to get that airway.

148
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,240
I'm scared.

149
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,780
I got nervous he'd be in a room with
him cause I was just watching him take

150
00:04:00,781 --> 00:04:02,230
chunks out of this fucking cookie.

151
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:04,310
They know I'm smelling the wheel.

152
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:04,951
This cookie.

153
00:04:04,951 --> 00:04:06,270
I'm like this is chaos.

154
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,920
You're not supposed to eat a whole cookie.

155
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,873
Fuck that.

156
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,360
And he just keeps going and then an hour
and 20 minutes later we're still doing

157
00:04:12,361 --> 00:04:14,670
the podcasts and Shelly's gone.

158
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,900
There's no way.

159
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,580
No Joey know Joey's left.

160
00:04:17,581 --> 00:04:17,910
Huh?

161
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,481
He's like dog.

162
00:04:18,481 --> 00:04:23,481
I have no idea when we talking you can
never eat edible marijuana it Joey Diaz

163
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,100
as you have thorazine on hand,

164
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,560
don't take that this,

165
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,110
you have a fucking and big hypodermic
filled with adrenaline that you get stuff

166
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:32,570
into your chest up.

167
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,010
Joey Diaz gave me once,

168
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,360
gave me like some breath strips I guess
is the first time I take him breath

169
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:41,790
strips and he was like,

170
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,130
eat two of these and I'm like,

171
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,520
I only took half of one of these knowing
him and I was driving home on the

172
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:53,360
interstate and was like,

173
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:53,860
well,

174
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,150
it's definitely the
apocalypse world is ending.

175
00:04:57,151 --> 00:04:59,660
I see that clearly now
there was a Mcdonald's,

176
00:04:59,661 --> 00:05:03,570
but now he's going to stop my car and
run to the Mcdonald's to get a burger.

177
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,040
He's traffic wasn't moving.

178
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,500
That's how bad the logic
was working in my mind.

179
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:07,921
Anyway,

180
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:08,491
I get home,

181
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:10,950
I'm having the most
terrible marijuana trip.

182
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,210
I'm laying in bed.

183
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:12,660
I'm like,

184
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,250
oh my God,

185
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,430
the world's in my heart's pounding.

186
00:05:14,431 --> 00:05:15,264
Phone rings,

187
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,523
phone rings,

188
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,363
Joey Diaz,

189
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,151
I answer it.

190
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:18,650
He's like,

191
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,790
welcome to my house,

192
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,673
motherfucker.

193
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:26,630
We joked,

194
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,740
pulled his dick out as jealous.

195
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,680
This is what I got to
tell this the first time.

196
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:34,220
That girl,

197
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:34,700
what's her?

198
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,040
That's what the function name,

199
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:36,950
the female comic.

200
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,630
All the ones that sued on Barris?

201
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,080
Yes.

202
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,800
What is her name?

203
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,221
Judy.

204
00:05:40,221 --> 00:05:40,510
Judy.

205
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,343
Judy.

206
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,520
Okay,

207
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,130
so this is what happens.

208
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:44,521
She goes on to say,

209
00:05:44,521 --> 00:05:45,354
we shouldn't have said her name,

210
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,840
she was on stage.

211
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,650
So she's,

212
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,910
she's on stage and she's not doing
real well and we all barbecue now.

213
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,780
It was a small crowd.

214
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,350
So watches onstage,

215
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,400
Joey into the back area,

216
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:01,400
there's like this backstage
area that's like in the,

217
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:02,770
or the O is a small room.

218
00:06:02,771 --> 00:06:06,080
It only seats about a buck 50 but it
does have a stage with a little backstage

219
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:06,530
area.

220
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,490
So Joey goes into the best day day.

221
00:06:08,491 --> 00:06:09,260
Jerry,

222
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,460
he goes to the backstage area,

223
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:13,130
it takes off all his clothes and he waits.

224
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,460
And so she's doing her act and
when she gets to our punchlines,

225
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,940
she hits the punchline and Joey opens the
curtains and shakes his thick and then

226
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,040
closes them up real quick.

227
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,590
And the people go crazy.

228
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,290
And you see this spark in her eye,

229
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,363
like

230
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,613
working,

231
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,600
I'm finally doing it.

232
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,540
You could see a relax and
every time she had a punchline,

233
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:36,640
jelly would pop open.

234
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,910
That curtain shakes day.

235
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,470
They close it and the people were
fucking just stomping their feet,

236
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,131
laughing,

237
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:44,660
slapping their tables.

238
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,370
She had so much confidence
in the next night.

239
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:49,190
You remember the last of the next time
we saw her on stage and looked at the

240
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:49,731
same jokes,

241
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:50,990
just just didn't,

242
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,943
didn't work.

243
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,083
It was like

244
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,140
she had the magic cause
she had it for one night.

245
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,680
But the weird thing is remember when
Alison was on and we had talked about this

246
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:05,260
being a open mic comic and how a lot of
these guys are doing these tricks and

247
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:08,200
one of the things that Allison was talking
about is how this guy wanted her to

248
00:07:08,201 --> 00:07:13,201
pay $100 in order to do five minutes in
the belly ring belly room and she was

249
00:07:13,271 --> 00:07:16,330
going to do that because
she thought that's what you
had to do to be an open mic

250
00:07:16,331 --> 00:07:17,590
comic hundred dollars.

251
00:07:17,591 --> 00:07:18,424
Yes.

252
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:18,920
Close.

253
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,050
You paid a hundred you're sucking my
dick and give me a coat from Julie.

254
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,760
You think I'm fucking kidding you?

255
00:07:23,761 --> 00:07:24,211
Fuck yeah,

256
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:25,110
you got to suck my Dick.

257
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,700
We got up in the bedroom and make a
coffee that how many girls did you have to

258
00:07:27,701 --> 00:07:28,050
do that?

259
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:28,930
All 20 of them.

260
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,830
I had this little blind open mic check.

261
00:07:31,831 --> 00:07:32,221
God.

262
00:07:32,221 --> 00:07:36,000
They used to come up to the commies low
at 20 and just take me up to the belly

263
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:36,870
room was sucking my Dick,

264
00:07:36,871 --> 00:07:37,740
then go do his set.

265
00:07:37,741 --> 00:07:38,574
She was tremendous.

266
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,800
Then a year later she wrote me
a letter to the comedy store.

267
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:41,740
You Cock sucker you.

268
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,630
I kept shooting sperm
balls and they'll fucking,

269
00:07:46,631 --> 00:07:47,340
he had bought,

270
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,980
I wouldn't have asked for
$100 and blow jobs and legit,

271
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,330
that's known.

272
00:07:51,331 --> 00:07:51,900
You know what I'm saying?

273
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,720
That's nose blow jobs.

274
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,710
$100 is bad cause right when you shoot it,

275
00:07:55,711 --> 00:07:56,750
I am become death.

276
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,920
It's trotter over your belief by stuffing
into thinking you're going to get on

277
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:00,763
stage.

278
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,870
I was like on a Friday
night and she's like,

279
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:04,461
Joe,

280
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:04,921
you ain't know.

281
00:08:04,921 --> 00:08:09,450
You know people get me and I looked her
straight to the face as a joke and I go,

282
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:09,990
God,

283
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,690
you're going to have to sign.

284
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:10,921
I'm like,

285
00:08:10,921 --> 00:08:11,071
no.

286
00:08:11,071 --> 00:08:11,461
I said to,

287
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:12,690
I didn't even say something they could be.

288
00:08:12,691 --> 00:08:13,524
I said,

289
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,270
I get you on stage and be to work.

290
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,141
And she goes,

291
00:08:16,141 --> 00:08:19,250
what do you mean like a little
put you to work after she got the,

292
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,880
you got to do something and
she will look at me and goes,

293
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,040
I'm not really good at
you have to teach me.

294
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,300
Oh you went back to our house
and I told him at the house,

295
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:29,100
we had a great time,

296
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,280
but she had a period,

297
00:08:30,281 --> 00:08:32,050
but I went to either
ask you a tissue paper

298
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,781
and I just said,

299
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:35,650
keep sucking my dick.

300
00:08:35,651 --> 00:08:36,820
I can't handle that muffler.

301
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:37,661
That point.

302
00:08:37,661 --> 00:08:38,680
I'll get how fucked up.

303
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,890
I wouldn't need to get a little
pussy if you had a period,

304
00:08:41,891 --> 00:08:42,220
but I will.

305
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:42,521
I'll look.

306
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:42,880
Yes,

307
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,710
I'll just read the payment so I go whack
off on your next up you have to say,

308
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,850
I got to look a little muffly just even
get the party started and she had like a

309
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:53,430
little crumble like what it a dingleberry.

310
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:54,880
It's like somebody shot a spitball and it,

311
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,570
it just killed me dog.

312
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:58,940
I was like,

313
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,020
oh,

314
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,640
I can't even eat my dick it the whole
night and I haven't come forward Gigas and

315
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,940
I can say Mark Babbitt pick me
up like at eight in the morning.

316
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,083
No ma'am.

317
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,400
Did you get a good night's sleep?

318
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:08,731
Oh yeah,

319
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:09,564
sure.

320
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,623
Fuck,

321
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,743
I'm stuck.

322
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,620
I'm going to get my sticks second.

323
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:17,190
My boss Lik that's
commonly stole one old one.

324
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:18,520
The old days Joe rode.

325
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,440
His uncle was the chief of police and
that's who I used to run roll fags with.

326
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,940
The reason why we never got arrested
was because the guy that was my base was

327
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,770
the chief's son when I was growing up.

328
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:32,460
We were both 1617 he was as
good looking as Brad Pitt.

329
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,271
So that's what you do.

330
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:33,631
You put,

331
00:09:33,631 --> 00:09:34,140
let's say,

332
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,621
what is this?

333
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:35,520
What is this over here?

334
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:38,900
Let's say Burbank Boulevard is
where all the gay guys hang on.

335
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,430
I would take the best
looking guy and go pro,

336
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:42,600
just standing up there for an hour.

337
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:46,170
We'll give you a piece of the
action and just a salesman,

338
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,243
they pull up,

339
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,930
don't pull up one time and look at you.

340
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:49,940
They'll make a uturn.

341
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,460
They'll come back then don't make believe
like they're looking for directions

342
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:54,061
and then they'll go,

343
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:55,200
you know what's going on?

344
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:55,521
And you're like,

345
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:56,354
no,

346
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,203
what are you going on?

347
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,620
I was looking for a date.

348
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,160
Well,

349
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,680
I was looking for a date for 100 bucks.

350
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:02,514
I'll suck your Dick.

351
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,241
So he would say,

352
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:04,590
I don't want to suck you
into kind of the street.

353
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,150
Let me,

354
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,670
let me blow you into
the park and the park.

355
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:10,020
We would be hiding in the tree.

356
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,270
So as soon as he went into
the tree to get a dig site,

357
00:10:12,271 --> 00:10:13,950
we fly out like a fucking superhero.

358
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,443
What happened?

359
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,181
I'll go onto that site.

360
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:16,450
It says,

361
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:16,881
just climb.

362
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:18,330
I'm over their head and take that boot.

363
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:20,390
So that shoes and that
money and I got off,

364
00:10:20,391 --> 00:10:21,224
have a or anyway,

365
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,170
yet nobody,

366
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:23,430
no.

367
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,900
So it was kind of fucking crazy.

368
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,470
Listen,

369
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,370
before I was driving,

370
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:27,120
I seen this kid,

371
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,640
Jewish kid with a Yamaka on
walking around like a fucking Momo.

372
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:31,483
It's sandals on.

373
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,600
I almost pulled over and grabbing
him by the shirt and said,

374
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,740
you're a fucking Jew.

375
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,330
You're a dumb fuck walking around and
have some fucking bumpy one be dude

376
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,460
walking around like a fucking lumpy,

377
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:45,550
dumpy and not stop fucking
move bodies that are racist.

378
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,293
Fucking crazy.

379
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,571
Yeah,

380
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:55,800
that.

381
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,570
Have you seen that picture
of Daniel Day Lewis

382
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,583
Suck my state.

383
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,330
Go down a lot.

384
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,430
And you're making a movie about a
who gives a fuck cut an apple tree or

385
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,603
something.

386
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,590
That's what you got to get back on.

387
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:11,610
But he's Mambos mine.

388
00:11:11,611 --> 00:11:15,930
They don't like it does look exactly
somewhere Zito from Miami vice

389
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,930
fuck gave Lincoln.

390
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,650
There's nothing wrong with my space and
I'm gonna tell you why because in a year

391
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:23,470
it'll be back.

392
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:23,611
Yeah,

393
00:11:23,611 --> 00:11:28,611
but you know it'll be back and then all
you momos that got rid of your page or

394
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,750
you fucking moocs MIT sites.

395
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,830
The moment when we were hanging out at
the Bray Improv and you did that fucking

396
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:36,870
bit about about dead Dick.

397
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,261
He goes,

398
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:38,760
you take two popsicle sticks,

399
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,720
new tie that tick up and you throw it
back in like a wounded soldier and Joey

400
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,950
gimme your prognosis,

401
00:11:43,951 --> 00:11:45,870
what's going to happen with
this occupy Wall Street?

402
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,531
Well here it is.

403
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:47,340
First off,

404
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,140
we'll live in a fucking sixties just
because you pimp up and time outside of my

405
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,260
fucking house with a tent.

406
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,370
I'm supposed to stop doing what I'm doing.

407
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,271
You got to go for you.

408
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:57,070
Gotta you gotta hit him
with a fucking populace.

409
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,240
That shit with a tent.

410
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:00,280
That's as the fucking guy
said in the Godfather.

411
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:01,114
That's Antigua.

412
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,580
If we're going against
every fucking cooperation,

413
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,713
they're part of that.

414
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,650
We got to step up and live by it
cause we've gotta set our marker and

415
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:10,830
unfortunate you think
we have those no way.

416
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,730
These things and show these mother fuckers
that we're not going to stand on wine

417
00:12:14,731 --> 00:12:15,610
like donkeys.

418
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,500
That's what we've become as a boundary.

419
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,740
That's why we'll never move
because we've become donkeys.

420
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,930
Fucking donkeys,

421
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,610
donkeys,

422
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,930
humans swim.

423
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:31,020
To avoid that Cuba swim 90
miles to avoid that feeling.

424
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,900
We've accepted standing
like life is funny.

425
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:35,763
It's funny.

426
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,920
Joe Rogan was kind of
put them in the store.

427
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:38,590
I've seen,

428
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,610
I get to the Mandalay.

429
00:12:39,611 --> 00:12:42,130
I checked in the room as a
comp under Joe Rogan's name.

430
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,120
He was very kind of the
pay for it and the way up,

431
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,580
they checked my credit card and they gave
me a slip and they sit on the way out.

432
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,910
You have to pay an extra
$49 and I go for what?

433
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,870
It's a con and they go,

434
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:54,160
it's an association fee.

435
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,533
Listen,

436
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,250
I'll pay an association fee.

437
00:12:57,251 --> 00:12:57,401
We'll,

438
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,800
I'll poke your fucking I app.

439
00:12:59,260 --> 00:12:59,760
I'm not.

440
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,400
I told you when you get two free
cocktails and I go ride the bike.

441
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,930
I couldn't even go to a spa.

442
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,150
I had to go ride the bike
like a communist by myself.

443
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,710
I couldn't and I said to the lady,

444
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,943
I don't think

445
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,770
one of the biggest lessons I ever learned.

446
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,870
I never drank again on new years.

447
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:17,981
Never.

448
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:19,360
After I seen that one new years,

449
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:20,500
I went to a party like that.

450
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,820
It was very chill.

451
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,960
Everybody was having a
good time unless I'm,

452
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,120
one of my buddies couldn't drink.

453
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:27,700
He started drinking and he
started spitting on the floor.

454
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,010
People.

455
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,830
That person said something to him
and he pulled like 200 hours in.

456
00:13:32,831 --> 00:13:33,820
The person said something to him.

457
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:34,151
She was like,

458
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:34,900
really?

459
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,111
He goes,

460
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:36,520
either I'd take my money and leave.

461
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:37,000
Well,

462
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,220
fucking cause he started some
shit and next thing you know,

463
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:40,150
all fight broke out.

464
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,290
That's the first time I flipped my ties.

465
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,510
Then he'd be on cooler bit my friend's
ear off that night we had a drive to the

466
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:46,931
hospital.

467
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:51,220
It was a Baggie with icing and the bottom
of his left ear lobe was in the thing

468
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:52,690
and he kept holding on to the close date.

469
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,310
As soon as I get stitched up,

470
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,590
I'm going to go back
there and fuck him up.

471
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,070
It was one of those fights.

472
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,770
This motherfucker til
this day won't give up.

473
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,350
You have to kill him with a stick,

474
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,813
but he was,

475
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,140
he was covered in blood.

476
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,580
They broke them up and he would say,

477
00:14:06,581 --> 00:14:06,800
okay,

478
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,510
I'm already,

479
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:07,820
they'd say,

480
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,160
golf is shake daddy's hand.

481
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,311
He'd go over to Dan.

482
00:14:10,311 --> 00:14:10,601
He said,

483
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:10,871
Daddy,

484
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:15,871
I'm sorry but your mother's still a car
and let's go one more fucking time and

485
00:14:16,511 --> 00:14:18,580
then they do it again for 20 minutes.

486
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:21,851
All right,

487
00:14:21,851 --> 00:14:23,380
get me Laura and I'll start a,

488
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:23,841
Danny would go,

489
00:14:23,841 --> 00:14:24,990
you're going to stop this time here.

490
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:25,790
There was,

491
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,700
it's a show showing them up
here to go shake his hand.

492
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:28,571
Yeah,

493
00:14:28,571 --> 00:14:29,000
it's old.

494
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,800
You know what?

495
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,360
Your mother still has read an or he's
got his ear and a baggy with ice,

496
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,320
and he's like,

497
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,740
I hope this back to hurries up because
I'm going to go back to his house and

498
00:14:38,741 --> 00:14:39,850
knocked the fuck out of it,

499
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:40,481
but I never,

500
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:40,930
ever,

501
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,400
ever drag again.

502
00:14:42,401 --> 00:14:44,220
I do use stay black cops,

503
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,113
other

504
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,530
big head.
