1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,310
Yeah, my oldest one's super. Here
we go. Five, four, three, two,

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,410
one. Ben And ladies, gentlemen, Dude,
I've talked about you on this podcast.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,510
It at least a dozen times. You are the
number one guy that I'm most disappointed,

4
00:00:15,511 --> 00:00:19,560
never fought in the UFC. Yeah. I
always get, whenever you talk about me,

5
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,920
I get like 15 texts. Like, hey Joe,
Joe talking about you now and you know,

6
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:26,910
they'll send me clips or whatever. So
obviously appreciate that. Um, but yeah,

7
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:27,271
I never,

8
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:31,470
I never really got to fight those top
guys and it was for reasons beyond my

9
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:35,610
control. Yeah. And you're done
now. Yeah, I saw, I said, I said,

10
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,320
I don't want to say I'm done period.

11
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:42,150
I said I'm done excluding the fact that
I get to fight and prove I'm number one.

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,900
That would be the excluding facts.
So if you could get in the UFC,

13
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:48,990
you'd be willing to do it again. I mean,
I don't care where it is. Right. I,

14
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,860
I really genuinely don't.
And obviously that would be the,

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,220
the thing that makes sense.

16
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:55,680
But there is legislation like the
alley act and the things going through.

17
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:59,280
So I don't know that maybe, you know, I'm
still 33 so I'm not old. And you know,

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,300
polluted GSP took four years off
from one flight to the next fight.

19
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,040
So I'm not saying I'm an age overnight.

20
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:09,480
Well your style to you avoided
so much damage. I didn't get,

21
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:12,780
I didn't get hit once this
until of 2017 so yeah,

22
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,100
I think you hit once in three fights.
So yeah,

23
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,780
I should tell people you
were fighting in one FC,

24
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:23,430
which is a big Asian organization. It's
like the Asian version of the UFC. Yeah.

25
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:27,080
So one FC started in 2012 I think.
Um,

26
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,330
obviously my contract with Belcher
came up in 2013 and then there was that

27
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:33,570
negotiation process and stuff obviously
went south. And what happened there?

28
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:35,070
You were the champ of belt or,

29
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,700
and then all sudden you left and
you are still undefeated, right?

30
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,220
I'm undefeated 18.
You know what the fuck happened?

31
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,140
That pellet tour let the champion will
go. That wasn't what happened. So no,

32
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,710
there's so much misinformation
out there. And you know, I,

33
00:01:48,711 --> 00:01:50,760
I'm popular but I'm not that popular.

34
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:55,650
And so lots of times in my story gets
missed toll because I get spoken over by

35
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:58,440
other people. Right. And they don't hear
what I say. So here, here's what happened.

36
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,370
Um, obviously, so prior
to me and Bella tour,

37
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,950
Hector and Eddie were the ones
that left, right? There were,

38
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,420
Hector was the lumber yard and Eddie
Alvarez, Alvarez, both of them,

39
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,820
both the middleweight champion
than the lightweight champion.

40
00:02:11,821 --> 00:02:13,500
They both got taken care of pretty well.
But if you,

41
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:16,020
if you remembered Eddie's situation,
I don't know if you remember this,

42
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,400
he got an offer from the UFC still
under the matching period of Beltre.

43
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,620
Beltre says we matched it.
Right.

44
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,450
And in terms of what was in the
contract, it was matched. Right?

45
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,600
But because Belterra
has no paper view venue,

46
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,860
well if you have c says we'll pay you on
pay per view belts as well. We will too.

47
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,850
But that's not real life.
That's still patients.

48
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,280
They've done two paper view shows
ever and they've never met any type of

49
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:43,750
threshold. So you know, they
say imagine, but it doesn't say,

50
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,371
I don't know if you remember,

51
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:48,390
but they went to court over it and the
UFC one Eddie has got the right to,

52
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,610
I'm sorry he didn't,
when he,

53
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,670
he somehow did it like a one more fight
in Bellator and then went to the UFC.

54
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:58,260
I don't know exactly what the finality
of that case was. But anyways,

55
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,190
when that happened, his, his

56
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,190
contract became public knowledge.
Right.

57
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,250
And so a lot of UFC fighters
were pissed because he,

58
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:10,630
they gave him a whole bunch of money.
And so when I was 12 and older, I will,

59
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,610
I have my last fight in belt
organs down under crush cough,

60
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:17,611
July 30th May 31st of 2013
beat him up pretty good.

61
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:20,920
And then I had a 12 month matching period.

62
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,990
And so what was expressed to me by the
UFC brass was that you need to get rid of

63
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:28,150
your matching clause and
we will make you an offer,

64
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:32,560
but we will not make you an offer until
that happens. Get rid of your matching.

65
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:35,950
Yes. How do you do that? Well, here,
here's how I went about doing it.

66
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,180
I exist 12 months. Right.
That's a freaking, I'm not
going to sell for 12 months.

67
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,560
So I'd call Bjorn or did it and say,
Hey Bjorn, I'm not gonna resign.

68
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,630
Please let one guy who was running belt
or correct. Yeah. And now he, you know,

69
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:50,530
he got fired. But um, and Bjorn
had a terrible reputation,

70
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,860
but I never,
I had a decent relationship with them.

71
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:57,910
I never like butted heads too bad. So
every tear this had Bjorn, let me go.

72
00:03:57,911 --> 00:04:00,250
I'm not coming back. And then so
everyone says it will bell toward,

73
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:02,470
didn't want to reassign me. Well
that's, that's not true at all.

74
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:06,940
Every day is Bjorn. Let me go. If you
aren't, let me go, because you know,

75
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:07,990
I love challenges.

76
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:10,480
What I love more than anything in
the world is a challenge myself.

77
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:12,520
If you look at my wrestling career,
that's what it's all about.

78
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:16,450
Taking the next best thing
every single time. And so, yeah.

79
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:20,500
So finally in and all this time, you
know, Dana and the UFC is saying,

80
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:21,830
we want Ben to ask him,
we won't been ask her.

81
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:25,360
And I'm ranked number seven in the world
or you know, somewhere around there,

82
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,203
12 and [inaudible].

83
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,000
And so I remember I was going to the
Asian food store cause I was gonna make

84
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:33,070
some Tom cost soup and Bjorn calls me,
said,

85
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,870
you're released full, full, you're
released, you can go. And I have to say,

86
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:41,410
I appreciate that. So Friday morning,
it was Thursday night, Friday morning,

87
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:45,410
it's in November, sometime
in May, mid November, um,

88
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,470
morning they fax over the release,

89
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,100
my management faxes it to UFC headquarters
and all of a sudden that afternoon

90
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,121
there's a,
you know,

91
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:55,450
like a little scrum where
everyone's asking Tina
questions and the dentist says,

92
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:59,740
we're not interested in Ben
[inaudible]. And I said, wait,

93
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,290
what just happened there?
Right.

94
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,210
Because for the last three months
they were saying, we were interested,

95
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:04,571
where's your,

96
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:09,430
where's your where's did now I finally
produced this full release from Bella

97
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:13,840
tour that I got and now they're
not interested. And so I said, wow,

98
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,610
I just got caught in the middle
of this. And uh, was there
a reason given? Well, so,

99
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:21,760
okay, so the Monday, so then
I say f that I buy my potato,

100
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,780
I bought a plane ticket to Vegas for
Monday, so that was Friday. That happens.

101
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,060
I say, fuck that. I'm going to Vegas.
I'm not taking this shit, you know. So,

102
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:34,960
uh, Monday I buy my plane ticket to Vegas,
I fly out to Vegas to UFC headquarters.

103
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,360
Uh,
I met with Lorenzo.

104
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:42,120
Dana was on the little speakerphone
dealy and they offered me a,

105
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,570
a zoo for contract,

106
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,320
but it would be confidential and I would
have to fight one fight for the world

107
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:52,210
series of fighting, which is like,
well that's bizarre. What? Yeah.

108
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:52,801
And they said,

109
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:55,690
didn't fight for the world series a
funding the exact relationship with the

110
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:59,370
world series the world. I don't like a
feed organization at that time. Something,

111
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,160
yeah, I mean I, yeah,

112
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,400
Marlin Mris. Just engage you both
those guys came from champs over there.

113
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,700
Yeah.
I think the relationship was,

114
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,930
is very hazy between the old world series
of fighting in the UFC because there

115
00:06:10,931 --> 00:06:13,020
was also, people don't
want the other way. Right.

116
00:06:13,021 --> 00:06:17,740
Andre Arlovski gets dropped from the FC
goes to world series. I, Anthony Johnson,

117
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,470
boom. All these people. Yeah. So
they say one fight, one fight,

118
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,370
world series of fighting. We will pay
Zoopla, we'll pay you, what'd you do?

119
00:06:24,371 --> 00:06:28,900
One fight. Okay. I say let
that's F it up, but okay. I said,

120
00:06:28,901 --> 00:06:30,490
I don't think anyone's going to go for it.
I'll do it.

121
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,120
So I leave and about six hours
later I got a phone call.

122
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:41,080
Is that deal is no longer available. We
are not going to make you an offer. Yeah.

123
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:45,320
So, wow. And you have no
idea why? Well, I, I, so I,

124
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,550
here's my guess. I've never got to
sit face to face. And you didn't say,

125
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,270
what was your problem with me? I
think there's four things. My mind.

126
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:57,340
Number one, he didn't really
like me. Um, stemming from the,

127
00:06:57,341 --> 00:07:00,880
I called them out on the steroid thing,
you know, where he said it's impossible.

128
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,390
And this is where our disagreement,
it's impossible to test all UFC athletes.

129
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,290
I said,
well that's not true.

130
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,930
You cited does it all over the world
for all kinds of athletes. Right.

131
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,050
You can do it. It's just expensive.
But let's just call it what it is.

132
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,730
You're a private business.
You don't have to do drug testing.

133
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:17,630
And it's obviously they do it now.
Do it now. Yeah. Do it through Usada.

134
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,710
So you were totally right. Yeah. So I,
I was correct and now, but that was,

135
00:07:20,711 --> 00:07:24,310
you know when Dana is wrong in an
argument and he's got this huge army that

136
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,530
follows him and he said,
I'd rather hit,

137
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:28,980
I think his quote was bad cause
I'd rather watch flies fucked.

138
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,370
And Ben ask him fight. You know, I think
he said something like ambien takes,

139
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:36,070
Ben asked her, he goes asleep.
Yeah. There, there's a few of them.

140
00:07:36,071 --> 00:07:39,820
So the personal attack started, right.
So that, that's number one. Number two,

141
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:41,860
my fighting style is
not highly attractive,

142
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:45,550
but I also think that's a little bit of
fake news because if you look at George

143
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,900
St peers to consistently novelty,
McGregor trumped him.

144
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:51,970
But only a couple of times,
but if you will get consistent basis.

145
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,920
George Saint Pierre is the
number one draw of all time.

146
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,800
He heavily relied on take
downs and ground and pound.

147
00:07:56,801 --> 00:08:00,580
I mean he didn't have a finish in
like five years or something. Let me

148
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,700
say what my take is always been on you
and that style is that it's important and

149
00:08:06,671 --> 00:08:10,330
that it really, it really
works. Yeah, absolutely.
You're able to do really works,

150
00:08:10,331 --> 00:08:13,900
and I've always said this and it was
proven son a Saturday night in the steep

151
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:17,920
Emile Chick Francis Econo fight. Wrestling
is the most important part of MMA.

152
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,930
Absolute ability to take
the fight to the ground.

153
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,210
Obviously Steve Bay has a
lot of other attributes.

154
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:24,550
He took tremendous punches in that fight.
I mean,

155
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:26,800
I know you didn't get a chance to
watch it, but I saw some highlights.

156
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:29,470
The Holy Shit.
I mean the first round was chaos.

157
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,520
I mean Francis and Gannon was a terrifying
guy and Steve Bay took the shots,

158
00:08:33,521 --> 00:08:35,740
use great movement,
you striking of his own,

159
00:08:35,741 --> 00:08:38,860
but most importantly after a
while God is wrestling going.

160
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,940
And then once he got in God
but to the ground and gone,

161
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:43,860
I didn't have any answers. He
didn't know what to do. What your,

162
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:48,010
what you've been able to do to guys
like Douglas Lema who just fought Rory

163
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:49,480
macdonald for the bell to our title.

164
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:53,200
Really good fight of course golf who is
another fantastic fight who uh, you know,

165
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:56,040
it was beaten a lot of really top guys.
Yeah.

166
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,560
You're able to use your wrestling
and completely nullify all,

167
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:01,590
they're striking an offense and
that's a huge part of fighting.

168
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,770
Fighting is not what's
exciting for people to watch.

169
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,940
Fighting is what actually works and what
you've been able to do time and time

170
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:13,920
again is take these guys who looked like
world beaters and completely nullify

171
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:17,310
their offense, taken to the
ground and beat the shit out
of him. Yeah, that's huge.

172
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,690
That's very,
very important.

173
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,100
Yeah, absolutely. And so, you know, not
so we can get back to the UFC thing,

174
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,940
but so yeah. I mean when I started
fighting, right, it was just like, hey,

175
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,830
let's go fight.
I didn't live in a coaching.

176
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,600
And so I didn't move to Duke's
until to Souk Rufus. Yes.

177
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:38,550
Until 2010 I think. So I
started, no, no, no. 2011 I'm
sorry. Cause I was in Arizona.

178
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:42,270
I was coaching for Arizona
State University. But when
I moved there, I know, hey,

179
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:45,410
the I, there's a lot of elite
strikers in this gym. I said, but I,

180
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:49,950
I'm never going to be elite striker. But
if no one can hit me, they can't beat me.

181
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,650
They're not gonna outlast me. They're
not going to help her. Apple, me,

182
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,990
they're not going to beat me
if they can't knock me out.

183
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:56,340
They're not going to beat me.
Plain and simple.

184
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,820
So my whole goal was how do I not get hit?
Not,

185
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:02,490
I don't need to be a great striker hitting
people. I just need to not get hit.

186
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:03,630
If you can't knock me out,

187
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,330
I'm going to eventually get you on the
ground and I'm going to beat your ass.

188
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:09,390
Right. And so that was kind of my
whole goal when I got an amaze,

189
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:12,360
how do I not get knocked
out? Right. And so you said,

190
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,550
obviously I've found a
really good way to do that.

191
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:19,220
And it added a lot of longevity in my
career where I wasn't taking damage a,

192
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,570
a lot of other people were taking.

193
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:25,260
And I think there's also a lot of other
things to being a really high level

194
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:26,100
wrestler that,
you know,

195
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:29,280
besides obviously you can control
where the fight happens, right?

196
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:33,230
But there's a lot of other things that
high level wrestling provides us, right.

197
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:37,140
That came from that world that other
disciplines don't get. You know,

198
00:10:37,141 --> 00:10:40,260
a lot of competition. We compete
thousands of times. Right?

199
00:10:40,261 --> 00:10:42,090
How to get our mind right.
Um,

200
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,830
these wrestlers are just strong and then
there's just a different strength that

201
00:10:45,831 --> 00:10:46,201
he's actually,

202
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:49,650
I got to go work how term Burroughs
last week cause a many time world champ.

203
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,670
And it's like you forget how
strong wrestlers are. Like
you grab him, you're like,

204
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,920
good God, this guy is like, you
know, I don't feel that from him.

205
00:10:56,921 --> 00:10:59,370
Maybe people like grab him and
I'm like, oh my, everywhere.

206
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:03,380
It's like there's no worries. Week.
Um, very, very disciplined. Right?

207
00:11:03,381 --> 00:11:04,201
Cause a wrestlers,

208
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:07,290
like we've been in the system from youth
wrestling to high school wrestling to

209
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,270
college. I said, well,
we're under, you know,

210
00:11:09,271 --> 00:11:12,420
coaches and have a very strict training
plan and understand how to put a

211
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:16,200
training regimen together where a lot of
other martial arts don't have that kind

212
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:17,310
of structured system.

213
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:21,360
So I think there's a lot of advantages
that we as a wrestlers have when we come

214
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:21,950
in mixed martial arts.

215
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,440
And if I could add to that,
the intention is pure,

216
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,380
it's pure for competition because
there's no financial reward.

217
00:11:27,381 --> 00:11:29,600
It's not a bunch of people
that are getting into
wrestling because they want to

218
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:32,600
get rich. It's a bunch of
people that really want to
prove that they're the best.

219
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,840
And so you have so many top flight guys
that are incredibly mentally strong

220
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,710
feeding off of each other,

221
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,910
knowing that they're going to be
competing against each other and almost no

222
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,370
financial possibilities
except for coaching.

223
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:50,430
Well, yeah, there's, I mean
now, so 2018 to 20, uh,

224
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,530
2008 when I was wrestling and then
when I decide to make that jump MMA,

225
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,640
there is a lot better financial
structure for senior level athletes. No,

226
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:02,170
none of them are getting rich and there's
only about a dozen and I'm making like

227
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:06,430
a decent living. Right? Yeah. And so which
is crazy. There's thousands of wrestlers.

228
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:08,260
Exactly.
So your points mostly correct,

229
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:12,010
but there are a handful of top United
States athletes now who can do nothing but

230
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:14,800
wrestle. Where when I was in,
in 2008 when I was trained,

231
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:18,370
that wasn't even the case. I had to go
do camps. I was coaching at Missouri,

232
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,740
so I was doing other things
in addition to wrestling.

233
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,880
So like a top Olympic athlete. What
else would they do to make money? Well,

234
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:27,880
so like in 2008 I was doing
a lot of camps, right?

235
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:31,930
You'd travel around the country, do
camps, make money, coach a college team.

236
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,160
I was making money that way.

237
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,280
So the handful of things I didn't like
w w it wasn't just wake up and train

238
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:37,114
every single day.

239
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,790
But the athletes today that you were
saying now that's what they're doing.

240
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,910
That's it. Coaching and different
things. No, no, no, no, no.

241
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:43,970
Some of them don't have to.

242
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,630
Anything you're saying that just do it
from where are they getting the money?

243
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,220
Jordan Burroughs and James
Green for example. Um,

244
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,670
sponsorships are slightly
more lucrative than they were.

245
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:56,350
Then there's something called the regional
training center system. Um, which,

246
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:56,561
you know,

247
00:12:56,561 --> 00:13:00,430
most major colleges have one that's a lot
more lucrative and that's fundraising,

248
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:04,660
right? They're not, they're not earning
money that the RTC people go say, hey,

249
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,910
rich guy,
would you like to fund this program?

250
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,300
That'll help us develop Olympic
level athletes. Sure. Okay. Right.

251
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,370
And then the United States,
uh,

252
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:16,570
you soc has slightly more funding given
to USA wrestling than in the past. Well,

253
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,950
it's the tragic story of John Dupont. I
mean, that's literally why that whole,

254
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:24,310
if people have seen that movie, what was
that movie called? Fox got Fox catcher.

255
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:28,900
Yeah. Awful crazy story of,
um, Dave and Mark Schultz.

256
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,090
And this millionaire or
billionaire crazy guy,

257
00:13:33,091 --> 00:13:36,820
I believe in her and wound up
shooting Dave Schultz and uh,

258
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,190
was just Weirdo guy that
was running this camp.

259
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:43,520
And these guys kind of got stuck
training with this gap because I mean,

260
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,170
and that's 96 was when Schultes got shot.
Right.

261
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:51,150
And so that's 12 years prior to,
you know, my Olympic birth and,

262
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,710
and so then it's even worse.
I mean,

263
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:57,070
these guys are literally making
nothing and that then, you know,

264
00:13:57,071 --> 00:14:00,220
then we'll go back to the argument of
amateurism and the Olympics is stupid,

265
00:14:00,221 --> 00:14:03,490
which was abolished like 92 of the
Dream Team was kind of totally abolished

266
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:08,240
tourism. But yeah, those guys in
that era, that 84, 88, 92 nights,

267
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,210
they were making nothing.
And so when this guy,

268
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:13,690
John Dupont offers them money
and stipends and places to live,

269
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,520
they don't really have a better option.

270
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,980
And it's freaking sad
to be honest about it.

271
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:20,620
And then obviously USA wrestling
sanctioned him because he gave you as a

272
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,060
wrestling a lot of money. So yeah,
it was really bad thing. And,

273
00:14:23,061 --> 00:14:27,360
and so we're doing a lot better in 2018
than we were 10 years ago. And Way,

274
00:14:27,361 --> 00:14:29,650
way better than we were
doing 20 years ago. Yeah.

275
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:34,651
The Olympic thing where they try to
treat the Olympics like it's an amateur

276
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,274
sport event.

277
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,450
It's a business you're making absolutely
ins and billions of dollars off these

278
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:44,200
athletes who get paid zero
is to me it's disgusting.

279
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:49,220
I think it's just this relic of ancient
thinking and these guys are using it to

280
00:14:49,361 --> 00:14:51,980
steal money from young athletes.
That's what I think.

281
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,390
I think the hard thing is theft.
Yeah. I usually don't know whom.

282
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,670
Who's more evil that you
soc or the IOC or the NCA.

283
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:01,460
Cause the NCA runs right
along the same lines.

284
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:05,270
And I think both are pretty evil and
both are archaic and both DDB changing.

285
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:09,410
And you know,
if you could abolish the NCA and the IOC,

286
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:11,760
that'd be fantastic for
athletes worldwide. Yeah.

287
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,810
Well especially when you look at the
football teams that are getting literally

288
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:19,811
billions and billions of dollars every
year and these athletes are ruining their

289
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,630
lives. I mean you have football
players that maybe play one,

290
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,080
two seasons if they're lucky,
if they get their back blown out,

291
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:30,410
their legs get blown out and then
they never have an NFL career.

292
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:33,620
And meanwhile the university
has made tons of money,

293
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,160
tons of money and they make nothing.
Yeah. And to make that even worse,

294
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:37,830
cause I actually had to,

295
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,090
I had a whole podcast about this argument
with someone and to make that end,

296
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:42,950
we're on the same side of this,
but to make it even worse,

297
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,450
if you're an NCAA athlete,
Joe,

298
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,610
you can't even make money off
your own image and likeness.

299
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,700
You can't have a youtube channel.
It's crazy.

300
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,460
It's so not only will
they not pay you anything,

301
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,860
which I think we can
debate and argue on that,

302
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,500
but the fact that they can't
make money off their own name,

303
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,360
own image and likeness it,
that's, it should be criminal
for that to happen. Jimmy,

304
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:03,440
you were telling me about this,
right?

305
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:07,610
Like a guy got in trouble for having a
youtube channel where it was punter for

306
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:10,160
like an a college football team
or a kicker. I remember his name,

307
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,260
I don't remember his name,
it on and there was a,

308
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:15,500
there was a wrestler from the University
of want to say University of Minnesota.

309
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:21,170
He made a rap album and he had to either
quit the wrestling team or or donate

310
00:16:21,171 --> 00:16:24,210
all the money back or something
like that. It's like rap, rap,

311
00:16:24,211 --> 00:16:27,140
rap and wrestling have,
they have nothing to do with each other.

312
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,610
The fact that he can't go make money
off freaking recording an album is like

313
00:16:31,611 --> 00:16:32,450
mind blowing.

314
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,180
It's disgusting because you're
keeping a kid from being industrious.

315
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,420
You keeping a a young guy. I was trying
to find his way through the world.

316
00:16:38,421 --> 00:16:40,520
You keeping them from
being successful and,

317
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,360
but though that kind of success like
figuring out a way to make some money off

318
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:47,780
of that other name, doing rap that could
lead to all sorts of paths in life.

319
00:16:47,781 --> 00:16:51,920
Like he's, he's learning as a young guy
like, hey look, I could be industrious.

320
00:16:51,921 --> 00:16:54,440
I could go do this. I can be
creative. I can go do that.

321
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:58,250
Like this is what we should be encouraging
people to do to take chances and make

322
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:58,491
money.

323
00:16:58,491 --> 00:17:02,390
The idea that you're saying like somehow
or another this spoils his amateur

324
00:17:02,391 --> 00:17:06,320
athletic standing. It's just stupidity.
I think it's fucking disgusting.

325
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,350
It drives me nuts. Agree a hundred
percent. It just drives me crazy.

326
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,980
So we're back to your
situation with the UFC.

327
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:16,160
So the UFC says we're not offer no offer,
no offer.

328
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:20,090
So tours release too. So I, I had
spent three months telling Pella Tor,

329
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,590
do you think you played, you feel like
the USC might've played a little way?

330
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,360
They played me harder sell. Okay. So
number the reasons Dan doesn't like me,

331
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:29,870
number one. Number two, my
style and not that great. Right?

332
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,720
Didn't you say something
like he's a bald steroid?

333
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,690
It was mostly after the fact,

334
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:40,550
after that went down that I really
torture him. But um, you know, but the,

335
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,330
the original one was, he's lying
about this, the Usada thing.

336
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,410
So that was the simpler the,

337
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,100
those people who say me and
Dana had beef prior to me

338
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,880
not getting it off.

339
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,000
Have you met him? Yeah, I
mean, yeah. Not Talk to him.

340
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:56,820
We've never had at length conversation.
So great guy.

341
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,180
Well the wrong impression of him.
I mean, I really love it that yeah,

342
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:01,810
you and I have had different experiences.

343
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,260
I always feel like I should be
there when people have experienced,

344
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,910
let me let you know the Dana. I know.
Yeah. So, um, so that would be too

345
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,511
three.

346
00:18:10,511 --> 00:18:14,110
I think obviously stealing a key piece
away from Bella tour was important to

347
00:18:14,111 --> 00:18:17,110
them. Um, and then number four,

348
00:18:17,111 --> 00:18:20,740
I think they thought I really had the
ability to be their champion and if

349
00:18:20,741 --> 00:18:25,000
someone can be a belt or champion and
make this transition directly to the FC

350
00:18:25,001 --> 00:18:27,340
and then be the UFC champion. I, you know,

351
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:31,330
they remember this when they're going on
filters down spike now that bell toward,

352
00:18:31,331 --> 00:18:33,530
use that to say, look, we're the
same. He was a champion here.

353
00:18:33,531 --> 00:18:37,150
He's a champion there. So I think
those four things are, and I've, Hey,

354
00:18:37,151 --> 00:18:40,810
I've never got to sit down face to face
day in and say, why was there no offer?

355
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,400
That one I've never got,
you know,

356
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:44,610
like when Anthony Pettis
was the champ and you know,

357
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,240
I'm helping coach him or tire was,
I,

358
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,650
I've haven't had more than five
words a day in passing. Right.

359
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,310
And so it would be really interesting to
me to sit down and say what was tell me

360
00:18:54,311 --> 00:18:57,370
for real, cause I have my
assumptions on what the deal was,

361
00:18:57,371 --> 00:18:59,830
but I don't really know.
And then if I have to add number five,

362
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,000
number five is I think he got the
idea that I would never be a yes man,

363
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,070
which I'm not going to
be. Never would be. Um,

364
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,510
where Dana really kind of likes the yes
man champion. I mean he, you see he's got,

365
00:19:10,511 --> 00:19:11,710
he's got some heat with Tyron.

366
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,380
He's got some heat with steep
bay as we saw on Saturday night.

367
00:19:14,381 --> 00:19:19,381
And he dated really struggles with the
personalities that won't cater to what he

368
00:19:20,711 --> 00:19:22,150
wants to happen.
Well,

369
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,010
fighters very rarely are yes men.

370
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,240
Then that's by nature of who they
are a little bit. Yeah. You know,

371
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,480
especially the really good ones,

372
00:19:29,481 --> 00:19:32,120
especially as things start going
well and start going their way.

373
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:34,220
They realize they're the fucking man.
I mean this is,

374
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,350
if you're the guy was
running the division,

375
00:19:36,351 --> 00:19:38,750
you're the guy who's running the division
and then you're not going to take any

376
00:19:38,751 --> 00:19:39,584
shit from anybody.

377
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:40,080
Yeah.

378
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,980
But that's [inaudible] you see as some
of these guys ascend right up the ranks,

379
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,160
they do. Like John Jones started
having trouble with Dana. Right.

380
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:47,960
But didn't have it

381
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,960
till he was Jones was having his problems
I think had very little to do with

382
00:19:53,741 --> 00:19:56,830
Dana and more to do with his
actions outside of the cage.

383
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,670
I mean inside the octagon he was and the
way he was promoted, he was promoted.

384
00:20:00,671 --> 00:20:04,180
Fantastic. But he's just
crazy. John's crazy.

385
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:09,160
You know John John needs a babysitter.
The baddest motherfucker at 205 ever.

386
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:13,210
He just needs an ear. Let him drive a car
anymore. When you got that much money,

387
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:14,750
it's beyond me like pace the,

388
00:20:14,751 --> 00:20:18,780
pay your buddy 40 grand a year and
have him drive you permanently.

389
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:22,840
Like why he was driving his own
car. That one's beyond me. Well,

390
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:26,350
they didn't know until they bought him
a Bentley and then he wrapped around a

391
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:29,680
tree. But that's when, that's when
they should have known. And then,

392
00:20:29,681 --> 00:20:32,410
but then there was the other one where
he hit and that was at the hit and run

393
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:34,510
was after that one up.
The hit and run was after that one.

394
00:20:34,511 --> 00:20:36,850
And then there was the other
one we got pulled over speeding.

395
00:20:36,851 --> 00:20:41,150
And it's good that he told the cop to
go fuck himself. Terrible decision.

396
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,520
Two ways. A fucking wild
dude. That's why he's so good.

397
00:20:45,521 --> 00:20:48,000
But then one of the reasons why
he's, but then you put, you got to

398
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,970
put safeguards in place, right? Like, like
you're making how many million a year?

399
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,720
Multiple. At least for sure. You can't
pay someone 40 grand to drive you around.

400
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,390
You're preaching to the choir.
I mean,

401
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:03,810
I wish I could clone me and send
me all to all these camps on top.

402
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:06,040
John, listen to me. Everything's
gonna be fine. I've got a driver,

403
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,670
we've got a Cadillac and escalate
out here. Wherever you want to go.

404
00:21:09,671 --> 00:21:12,970
We're going places. We're going to have
some fun. But no driving, no driving,

405
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:17,350
no none. We don't need driving. We've
got [inaudible] we've got fun. Let's go.

406
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,450
Oh my gosh. I mean, seriously. Yeah.

407
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,550
Well that's what you would have if
you know you had like, you know, it's,

408
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,350
I dunno what he's doing. I don't
know. I never been to Albuquerque.

409
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:31,180
I don't know how he's living,
but he can't babysit everybody.

410
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:34,570
You got the UFC has 500
fighters on its roster. I mean,

411
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,310
how many of those guys are prone
to wild behavior? I would say,

412
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,870
yeah. Yeah. Most of them. Right?

413
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,620
High risk males at playing a sport
where you have the potential to be heard

414
00:21:43,621 --> 00:21:46,020
every single time you step out on the job.
Yeah.

415
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,030
But when you're making
millions of dollars,

416
00:21:48,031 --> 00:21:52,760
you got to put safeguards against
yourself. Yeah. But I think also what

417
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,580
makes John so good is his self confidence
and he probably, he's like, ah,

418
00:21:57,581 --> 00:21:59,770
I got it. Yeah, I fucked up
before, but I got it now.

419
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:03,710
So I'm really into sports psychology
and I want someone to write this book

420
00:22:03,711 --> 00:22:06,380
because no one's ever written
it. But I think there's this, uh,

421
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:11,000
I call it the hypocritical elite athlete.
So there's two sides to every coin,

422
00:22:11,001 --> 00:22:14,600
right? And if you're a really
elite athlete, you need
both sides of those corner.

423
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:16,340
And I'll give you a great example because
this is kind of what you're talking

424
00:22:16,341 --> 00:22:20,300
about. There's these guys who are
ultra elite prepares the eat, right?

425
00:22:20,301 --> 00:22:23,870
They sleep right, they train, right?
They do everything right, right?

426
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:27,440
But then if one little thing goes
wrong, it messes with them, right?

427
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:31,130
If they don't get the right food or their
weight cuts bad, they start panicking,

428
00:22:31,131 --> 00:22:35,270
right? And then on the opposite side of
the coin, there's these cowboys, right?

429
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,480
And they're just like, I'm not going to
eat right. I'm not going to sleep right.

430
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,150
I'm not gonna do anything, right?
But when time the step of the cage,

431
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:45,740
I'm a fight my ass off and nothing's going
to bother me, right? And so you need,

432
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:48,350
you need both sides of those
coins to make, to make it whole.

433
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,530
And so you want someone ideally
who does everything right,

434
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:55,640
but at the same time when when something
goes wrong or their toe hurts or

435
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:58,460
whatever, they can just say,
well, it doesn't really matter.

436
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:01,280
I'm going to go compete anyways. Right.
You want to have both sides of those.

437
00:23:01,281 --> 00:23:04,460
And that's where I think a lot of the
UFC fighters are more on the cowboy side

438
00:23:04,461 --> 00:23:06,410
of it. Like, well, I'm not really
gonna do a lot of things right,

439
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,980
but I'm just going to go, I'm on fire.
I'm just, we'll fight like cowboy Debbie,

440
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:14,630
a fantastic example. This, yeah,
the namesake of my argument.

441
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,410
Yeah, that's a good
point. And it, it is, uh,

442
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,440
it's probably one of the more fascinating
things about any form of high stress,

443
00:23:23,781 --> 00:23:27,680
high level competition is there's no real
guidelines of how to prepare your mind.

444
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:28,581
You know?
I mean,

445
00:23:28,581 --> 00:23:31,670
everybody teaches you how to wrestle
every teaches you how to kickbox.

446
00:23:31,671 --> 00:23:33,440
There's all these martial arts schools.

447
00:23:33,441 --> 00:23:38,441
A teacher technique is very few real
like rock solid programs of a how to,

448
00:23:40,341 --> 00:23:42,520
how to manage your mind. Absolutely. Like,

449
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:47,280
I think you should be
taught almost like in, in,

450
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:50,450
in a step by step basis. Like,
Hey, you get a flat tire,

451
00:23:50,451 --> 00:23:54,860
do you kick your car and scream or do
you just go, this is what it is. And Hey,

452
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:57,650
I could have been born in
Ethiopia with no, right.

453
00:23:57,651 --> 00:24:01,850
I could be living in a fucking coal mine
somewhere. No, I'm lucky. I'm fortunate.

454
00:24:01,851 --> 00:24:03,610
This is thing.
This is a minor setback.

455
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:03,880
No.

456
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,150
And so like I actually started going to
graduate school for sports psychology.

457
00:24:07,151 --> 00:24:12,151
I got nine of the 36 credits done and
then I actually got a scholarship to go

458
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:16,660
further and, and you know,
get paid for. Um, but I was
just, I was traveling so much,

459
00:24:16,661 --> 00:24:17,580
that was 2007,

460
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,050
eight when I was trying to make the
Olympic team and I was gone all the time.

461
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,450
And then once I was out of school
for a year, I was just like,

462
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,690
there's no freaking way I'm going there.
I'm not going back to school.

463
00:24:25,691 --> 00:24:28,360
I'm not going to sit in a class.
You're not going to freaking write papers.

464
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,970
I'll still study sports psych on my own,
right?

465
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:33,820
And so actually every Monday
I do something called the
mental Monday and one of

466
00:24:33,821 --> 00:24:37,420
my Facebook pages and just people
message me questions and I talk about the

467
00:24:37,421 --> 00:24:38,620
mental aspect because you're right,

468
00:24:38,621 --> 00:24:41,080
there aren't enough people that
talk about it. And then, you know,

469
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:43,420
written wrestling is actually this
company that's being highly successful,

470
00:24:43,421 --> 00:24:44,710
I'll call wrestling mindset.

471
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:48,020
And they have a training program for
athletes' minds because you're right,

472
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,420
there's nothing out there. Is there
a website for this? Yeah, right.

473
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,570
It's rest of mindset.com.
No kidding. That's great.

474
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,880
And they're starting to s that'll
apply to everything, but well,

475
00:24:54,881 --> 00:24:57,640
they're starting to explain, expand in a
different disciplines. But you're right,

476
00:24:57,641 --> 00:25:01,300
I think, I think there's these
general principles of sports psych,

477
00:25:01,301 --> 00:25:04,420
which can kind of go into any
domain, right? And you're,

478
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:07,390
you're 100% correct that every single
individual is different. Right.

479
00:25:07,391 --> 00:25:12,310
And one of the, like for me, uh, um, I'm
an overthinker, right? I'm obsessive.

480
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:14,980
I'll do something over and over and
over and over it again. Right? And so,

481
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:18,550
like when I was 14 I was at this big
national tournament and I was obsessing

482
00:25:18,551 --> 00:25:21,650
about who I'd have to wrestle and all
this stuff. And it wore me out mentally.

483
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:24,550
I got my ass kicked right.
And my coach said, hey,

484
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:28,120
I was that person many,
many years ago.

485
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,340
And it helped me just to talk about
fishing. Right. Cause that maybe, cause I,

486
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,670
if I don't think, I don't want
to think about what I'm gonna do,

487
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,880
I'm not one of those guys because I
think about it too much. All obsessed.

488
00:25:36,881 --> 00:25:38,980
And so ever since age 15 I've,

489
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,970
I've always taught myself a train myself
to not think about the competition

490
00:25:42,971 --> 00:25:46,270
within like, you know, six hours, right?

491
00:25:46,271 --> 00:25:48,570
So maybe the day before I can think about
are a couple of days before I got to

492
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,130
think about it. But like, even
when I'm in MMA locker room,

493
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:55,960
I'm not thinking about my fight, my
minds off of it. Because if I'm not,

494
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,860
if I don't understand what my strategy
is going to be by six hours before and I

495
00:25:59,861 --> 00:26:03,460
haven't trained myself by six hours
before I fucked right. I'm already fucked.

496
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:05,720
Like, what am I going to do? Six hours.

497
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:10,550
It's a brilliant strategy in six
hours, you know, so like six hours.

498
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:15,990
I intentionally fly people to my fights
who are just my friends who have no

499
00:26:16,871 --> 00:26:20,440
intention of telling me what to do MMA
wise and just want to pull shit backstage.

500
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:21,340
Right?

501
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:25,030
Because really smart keeps me really calm
cause otherwise I start obsessing and

502
00:26:25,031 --> 00:26:26,290
that's going to lead to
something really negative.

503
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:29,470
So that's like one thing is where, you
know, but some people are the opposite,

504
00:26:29,471 --> 00:26:32,790
like the f off too much. You kind of got
to bring them back to focus. Right, right.

505
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:36,250
You know, in other sports side
concept is is what we'll learn. Gee,

506
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,040
do you want go into the competition? Some
people, you've got to get them amped up.

507
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:42,850
Some people, most people you got to calm
them down quite a bit. Like let's relax,

508
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:43,980
let's execute because we need to

509
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,470
up. You're gonna execute. Right?

510
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:49,920
So I think there's a lot of these sports
psych concepts that can cross over many

511
00:26:49,921 --> 00:26:52,680
different genres. But you're
right, no one trains you about it.

512
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:55,690
I think it's a huge part of
the sport and it's, it's,

513
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,480
it's overlooked because
the sport is not just,

514
00:26:58,481 --> 00:27:00,010
and I think this is true with every sport,

515
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,170
the sport's not just the
movements that you make.

516
00:27:02,171 --> 00:27:06,910
It's what's going on inside the machine.
Who, the manager of the body as the mind.

517
00:27:06,911 --> 00:27:10,780
And if the manager is like poorly formed
and the structures all out of whack and

518
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:15,250
you, you have like, whenever a problem
comes up, you fall right into a pit.

519
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:19,570
All these things should be addressed
and you should develop this mindset,

520
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:23,770
develop the ability to manage your
mindset. And He, I think at a young age,

521
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,450
I think it's,
it's really critical.

522
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:29,500
Yeah. No, I totally agree. And you know,
I think, I think one interesting thing,

523
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,800
which I don't know if it's going to
happen to them or now we'll see. Right?

524
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:37,060
There's very few people who came from
a wrestling background that are head

525
00:27:37,061 --> 00:27:39,880
coaches of MMA teams, right?
Who came from this very,

526
00:27:39,881 --> 00:27:43,630
very structured environment of college
wrestling. It's like you go to,

527
00:27:43,631 --> 00:27:46,120
I want you to remember my first training
camp went to American top team in

528
00:27:46,121 --> 00:27:49,190
Florida. And I show up, it's
11 o'clock practice show,

529
00:27:49,191 --> 00:27:53,710
but 11 o'clock uh oh where's,
where's everyone at? Right.

530
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:57,640
And then we started 1145 like 45 minutes
late. And then so the next day I'm like,

531
00:27:57,641 --> 00:27:58,060
well,

532
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:03,060
am I assuming and charm and 1145 or should
I show up at 11 because we say 1145 I

533
00:28:03,191 --> 00:28:07,150
can show up more. So I show up at 1130
and then they started 1120 you know,

534
00:28:07,151 --> 00:28:10,390
like what the hell where's in college
wrestling? If you're a minute late,

535
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,410
you're going to get punished. And college
wrestling, right. It's a very structured,

536
00:28:14,411 --> 00:28:15,041
organized system.

537
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:20,041
So I'm very curious to see the day
where there is an MMA team that is very

538
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:22,660
structured like a college
wrestling team would be,

539
00:28:22,661 --> 00:28:26,020
I think it would be very effective
towards performance for athletes. And,

540
00:28:26,021 --> 00:28:26,621
but then again,

541
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:29,890
you are going to have is a
different structure because
called dressers are poor,

542
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,620
right? Where are you going to a bunch of
MMA fighters who get rich and then say,

543
00:28:32,621 --> 00:28:34,600
well, I don't want to do
what you're saying right now.

544
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,270
How are you going to make them? Right?
They're the one paying your paycheck.

545
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,270
So it does become an
interesting circumstance,

546
00:28:40,271 --> 00:28:43,300
but I think if there was someone
who ran a highly structured,

547
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,540
mixed martial arts team as
structured as a college team,

548
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,790
I think they would have a
gigantic amount of success.

549
00:28:48,791 --> 00:28:51,780
I think their guys would get a
lot better, a lot faster. Um,

550
00:28:51,781 --> 00:28:55,660
and I think you'd see a really interesting
dynamic developed between the high

551
00:28:55,661 --> 00:28:56,860
level athletes and the coaches.

552
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,280
Well,
I think they're still trying to,

553
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,280
trying to figure out what's
the best way to coach fighters.

554
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:04,220
And I think everybody's got their own
way of doing it. You know, for us,

555
00:29:04,221 --> 00:29:07,280
the hobbies, ways different than the
way they do it at American top team.

556
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,430
Matt Hume was doing it different
than the way Duke does it.

557
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,140
Everybody's got their own way.

558
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,530
And the only way you could tell is
how well the athletes compete. Yeah.

559
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,650
That's the only way you really find
out who's correct and who's need,

560
00:29:18,651 --> 00:29:19,640
who needs to make adjustment.

561
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,380
Yeah.
And it's really hard and in fighting,

562
00:29:21,381 --> 00:29:25,790
because I mean even your highest level
camps, how many say Bella Torn Uca?

563
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:29,150
How many high level MMA
fights did they have per year?

564
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:32,750
Maybe 30 and I think that'd be a
lot for most of these teams. Right?

565
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,770
And so you only get 30 samples sizes,
right? Whereas the college wrestling team,

566
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:41,350
you're going to have between everybody
on the team, the all 40 guys,

567
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,500
you're going to have at least a thousand
matches every single year. Mint minimum.

568
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:47,800
Right. And then obviously
every event is scored by team.

569
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,920
Every deal made is scored by team,
every NCA championship scored by team.

570
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:54,070
So you get a very good indication of
what coaches are doing right and what

571
00:29:54,071 --> 00:29:56,890
coaches are doing it wrong. And then
obviously with recruiting process,

572
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,910
the coaching or doing a right now get
the next crop of the best talent. Right.

573
00:30:00,911 --> 00:30:04,120
And so you have a very good idea of
what's working, what is not working.

574
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:04,990
We're in MMA.

575
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:10,060
I think we struggle to see it because the
sample size isn't large enough to give

576
00:30:10,061 --> 00:30:11,980
us a really,
really direct correlation.

577
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:17,620
Now you were able to instigate
your strategy in pretty
much every single one of

578
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:18,981
your MMA fights.

579
00:30:18,981 --> 00:30:21,770
The only fight where you really struggled
as a j Heran turnoff fight. Yeah,

580
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,960
absolutely. That was a close fight. What
was different in that fight? Well, the,

581
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,600
so that was the,

582
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,680
my first fight at dukes. Um, obviously
Jane Iran is pretty damn good too.

583
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,300
I really don't want to take that
away from, I think he was right,

584
00:30:32,301 --> 00:30:35,530
number 16 the world or
something at that point in time.

585
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:38,660
That was my first fight at dukes. I
think the biggest mistake I made, I mean,

586
00:30:38,661 --> 00:30:41,300
and obviously at that time, I'm literally
two years into my fighting career,

587
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:45,130
right? So I stopped
wrestling completely. Um,

588
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,430
I didn't do one wrestling practice.
I moved to Duke's August for, well,

589
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,280
I moved to Wisconsin August 1st search
training, Duke's August 1st I fought, uh,

590
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,840
three months later at the end of October.

591
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,620
I literally did not do one wrestling
practice. So what were you doing? Uh,

592
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,360
I was just as striking
like six times a week.

593
00:30:59,361 --> 00:31:01,490
I was doing Jujitsu a
handful of times a week,

594
00:31:01,491 --> 00:31:04,760
and then I was doing conditioning instead
after that fight in my rest. Well,

595
00:31:04,761 --> 00:31:07,190
and then actually I went to, my brother
was living in New York at the time,

596
00:31:07,191 --> 00:31:10,430
who my brother is also an NCAA champ and
went to visit him for Thanksgiving and

597
00:31:10,431 --> 00:31:14,900
he whooped my ass and I'm like, I freaking
suck at wrestling. Like, you know,

598
00:31:14,901 --> 00:31:17,000
like I went cold Turkey and so it's like,
okay,

599
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,240
I don't need to wrestle every day to be
great at wrestling anymore, but I need,

600
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:24,650
I need to wrestle once a week,
twice a week with high level competition.

601
00:31:24,651 --> 00:31:28,280
So at that point in time,
and for pretty much the rest of my career,

602
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:32,960
I would go to one of the local colleges
once a week or twice a week just to keep

603
00:31:32,961 --> 00:31:33,800
my skills sharp.

604
00:31:33,801 --> 00:31:36,860
And so I think that was the biggest
mistake I made in the rom phase.

605
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:40,070
I didn't wrestle at all prior to
it. Um, but Jay, Ron was good.

606
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:44,090
He was also a division one
college wrestlers. He knew
what he was doing also. Um,

607
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:47,210
but I think if I, if I had to pinpoint
one thing that that would be it

608
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,990
isn't it fascinating that a guy with as
much wrestling the experiences you have,

609
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:54,980
all you have to do is take some time
off and everything degrades? Well,

610
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,580
it's timing.

611
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,760
It's all timing. Right? So you, you
take three months off your time,

612
00:31:58,761 --> 00:32:00,590
he's going to go to shit.
I mean, literally amazing.

613
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,630
Tell you I wasn't even one
practice and it's like,

614
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:06,740
but that was also what helped me get
the striking thing down is I was doing,

615
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,890
and this is what I think you
actually made this point.

616
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:14,170
A who the hell are you talking to about
wrestlers are willing to go to the

617
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,730
environment?
I was striking six to seven times a week.

618
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,130
How many strikers go and wrestle?
Six to seven.

619
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,400
None of them. Do they want to
leave? They refused to. Well,

620
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:26,550
there was Francis in Ghana. It's training
camp. When I talked to people outside,

621
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,120
uh, afterwards, it's crazy. Before
everyone was saying, oh my God,

622
00:32:30,121 --> 00:32:32,190
he's in tremendous shape.
Everything's amazing.

623
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,860
And then afterwards there was like,
uh, he doesn't train on the ground.

624
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:39,830
What he crazy train on the ground. Like
all he wants to do is strike. Yeah.

625
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,140
Well you can't let them do that.
You can't split up. I can't let him,

626
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:46,500
he's going to fight and a
division one wrestler. Yeah.

627
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:50,150
Like how is he going to do this? How is
he going to, how is it going to stand up?

628
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,340
He's going to somehow or another
magically stuff. All the take downs.

629
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,360
You have to train that.
You have to train it.

630
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,840
Yeah. And well, and then,
but you got to train it.

631
00:32:57,841 --> 00:33:00,990
But then even when people train it,
the striker the hell, those strikers,

632
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:04,620
they don't want to do it. Right, right.
Like I said, when I go to Duke's,

633
00:33:04,621 --> 00:33:08,100
when I started at dukes and it went
down to four times a week where we are

634
00:33:08,101 --> 00:33:08,881
striking,
right.

635
00:33:08,881 --> 00:33:11,730
But in the beginning it was six or
seven times a week sessions a week.

636
00:33:11,731 --> 00:33:16,350
I'm striking. Right. And so I'm immersed
in that culture. I have to learn.

637
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:21,150
You can't not learn me doing six to
seven times a week and but the strikers,

638
00:33:21,151 --> 00:33:24,810
they want to do one restaurant practice
a week to wrestling practice a week.

639
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,270
Well if you're here and they're here,

640
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:30,030
how are you going to catch them
by doing one practice a week?

641
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,090
It's freaking impossible.
You need to, I mean if I,

642
00:33:33,091 --> 00:33:37,320
if I got to like be in charge of
an MMA guys camp and I dunno, I,

643
00:33:37,321 --> 00:33:39,000
I coach wrestling,
I love coaching the kids.

644
00:33:39,001 --> 00:33:42,060
I don't know if I ever want to coach
Emma people I would consider for someone

645
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:44,460
like high level,
but you've got to immerse yourself.

646
00:33:44,461 --> 00:33:47,610
You literally have to take three months
and freaking wrestle every single day

647
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,370
because Russell, you've got to bill,
you have to build those skills.

648
00:33:50,371 --> 00:33:51,360
You're not going an alert.

649
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,700
You're not going to learn something
well doing at one time a week.

650
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,020
You are going to do it.
Period.

651
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,900
No, I, I completely agree
and I think that it,

652
00:33:57,901 --> 00:34:00,780
it all depends on what the
athlete brings to the table.

653
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,840
Like some guys have like a little bit
of wrestling and then maybe they need to

654
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:07,030
work more on submissions. Maybe some
guys need to work more on their striking.

655
00:34:07,031 --> 00:34:11,400
They get hit too much. I mean it's,
it's every single fighter is a,

656
00:34:11,401 --> 00:34:15,390
there's a different recipe and you
have to figure out what that recipe is.

657
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:18,840
And it's hard because it's like you
only way you find out is how well they

658
00:34:18,841 --> 00:34:22,200
perform in competition. And how many times
do you even get the chance to do that?

659
00:34:22,201 --> 00:34:24,420
Three a year. Three a year. Yeah, maybe.

660
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,970
Yeah. And so, you know, that's, that's
that. And listen, so I'm not saying,

661
00:34:28,971 --> 00:34:33,080
I'm not saying a striker has to do six
sessions a week for three years straight,

662
00:34:33,081 --> 00:34:36,800
but I'm saying it take three months, take
six months, immerse yourself in that,

663
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:41,210
be obsessed, be obsessed,
learn those skills, figure
it out. And then after that,

664
00:34:41,211 --> 00:34:43,990
it might be once a week, twice
a week, three times a week.
But then when, when, when,

665
00:34:43,991 --> 00:34:46,850
when, when we start considering
the, the CTE factors,

666
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:51,290
which I'm not totally sold on, on
CTE yet, cause you don't get hit.

667
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:56,360
And you know, this guy, he's a poster
boy for wrestling, martial art.

668
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:59,720
If you really think of,
yeah, no, for sure. But, so I
watched, I watched concussion.

669
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,910
I was actually flying to my fight in
April of 2016 a wash. I said, shit,

670
00:35:04,911 --> 00:35:08,420
that's scary. I did, I spark two
more times the rest of my career.

671
00:35:08,421 --> 00:35:12,470
So my crew was 19 more months.
I spoke twice. I just didn't,

672
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:15,270
I didn't do it just because you
didn't want to get hit. Uh, yeah.

673
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,350
I felt as an an an an an uh,
an unnecessary risk.

674
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:21,160
Well, there was a recent
study that came out, oh,

675
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:25,160
just a few days ago that said that it's
repeated subconcussive hits and they're

676
00:35:25,161 --> 00:35:27,260
causing CTE,
not concussions.

677
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,061
Yeah.
So the,

678
00:35:28,061 --> 00:35:32,920
but the study that made me really question
the CTE phenomenon was they did that

679
00:35:32,921 --> 00:35:35,830
study where they studied a whole bunch
of professional football players and it

680
00:35:35,831 --> 00:35:39,720
was like a hundred per se. It
was like 99% have CT. Right.

681
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:43,500
But then they studied people who had
played football for any length of time.

682
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,760
Yeah.
Any length of time.

683
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:47,910
And it was like still like 80%
of the people and it's like,

684
00:35:47,911 --> 00:35:50,860
well f I can't live my life in a bubble.
Right?

685
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:54,550
Like are like how can 80% of people
who have ever played football,

686
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,310
I mean how many American males,

687
00:35:56,311 --> 00:35:59,220
what percentage of American males walking
around at 40 years old today put some

688
00:35:59,221 --> 00:35:59,940
level of football?

689
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:04,140
It's like gotta be 80% so you're telling
me 70% of America is walking around

690
00:36:04,141 --> 00:36:07,440
with CTE? Yeah. Or the American males.
Like that's crazy. But that's real.

691
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:10,700
Come on really is what's
happening. No, I buy, you've got,

692
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,960
you've got to think there's gotta be
some kind of low threshold because

693
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:15,210
otherwise 40 years down the road,

694
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,570
if everybody played football and
everyone who played football has CTE,

695
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,870
everyone's going to be
walking around like there.

696
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,880
A lot of people are walking around like
that. Come on, that's what's going on.

697
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,770
Or is it a diet? It might be the Diet
coke. A little bit, a little bit of that.

698
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:33,350
I think way more people have some
form of brain damage than I do.

699
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:37,000
Well, I think in the world of martial
arts, I know so many guys. Yeah,

700
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,890
well let's talk about not martial artists
are just regular people, ball players.

701
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,890
I think football players,
it's even worse because you're running,

702
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,370
you're running at each other clashing
heads. I mean you watch football,

703
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,680
I mean the damage those
guys take his crave.

704
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:54,120
It's once in a UFC you'll
see like a wild head kick,

705
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:59,040
k boom and football games. These guys
are literally running at each other.

706
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,200
I mean it's crazy.
One team's running this way,

707
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:05,010
the other teams running that way and
they slam into each other and these guys

708
00:37:05,011 --> 00:37:10,011
are 200 5,300 pounds that that impact
that the jarring of your brain.

709
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,060
Plus they have helmets on,

710
00:37:12,061 --> 00:37:14,940
which allows them to be more
confident clashing into each other.

711
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,940
I think a giant percentage of those guys.

712
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,570
But you think,
but so like I said,

713
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:23,710
so if that one study said it was something
around 80% of anyone who ever played

714
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:27,850
any level of football field length of
time for anything like that has CTE.

715
00:37:27,851 --> 00:37:30,430
That means like, I mean, if we
take the American population,

716
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:33,420
at least hit 2% of American
men played football.

717
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:38,570
Yeah. They have CT. So we're talking
about like a gigantic population. Yeah.

718
00:37:38,571 --> 00:37:41,090
I think there's levels of CTE
though. I mean, I think, you know,

719
00:37:41,091 --> 00:37:42,710
you get to the point where you're like,
Joe Frazier,

720
00:37:42,711 --> 00:37:46,130
he could barely talk before
he died. Um, rest in peace.

721
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:49,220
But then you also get two guys that are
just like a little forgetful and don't

722
00:37:49,221 --> 00:37:53,180
know why, or impulsive and don't know
why. You know, there's a lot of that,

723
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,460
there's a lot of weird
stuff that comes to CTE.

724
00:37:55,461 --> 00:37:57,280
I've studied it pretty extensively.
Okay.

725
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,900
And the more studies that I've read on
it to more of [inaudible] gotten really

726
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:04,070
derby. So do you think there's maybe just
a low threshold for what they call CTE?

727
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:08,620
Well, there's also genes that certain
people have. What was that gene? Rhonda.

728
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:12,240
Patrick talked about it. Uh,
I don't remember what it was.
Fantastic. She's amazing,

729
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:14,900
right? Yeah. And she
was talking about, uh,

730
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:19,930
some jeans make you more susceptible for
traumatic brain injury than other ones.

731
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:25,400
Like if you have it, you are many
times more likely develop CTE.

732
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,221
But then also,

733
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:30,390
and then so the other thing that I would
is out of curiosity to me when they did

734
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,200
a CT studies, especially
with they're doing, you know,

735
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,650
after death with these football players,
right? That were so now if they're dying,

736
00:38:36,651 --> 00:38:40,540
their pipe played in the sixties
seventies eighties that time period, uh,

737
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,130
steroid use very,

738
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:46,630
very high and drug use is also very high
in that culture and so, and and alcohol.

739
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:51,700
I'm including drugs. So it's
like, did those things contribute,

740
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,620
contribute? Is it a, you know,

741
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:58,621
is it like a mitigating factor or is it
like going to create this crazy storm of

742
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:03,580
brain damage that you're, you're going to
freaking running into people like this.

743
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:06,760
Then you're doing steroids, then you're
a freaking drink and a pack of beer.

744
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,300
Then you're doing some cocaine like

745
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:12,400
that. That can't be good for you. Right?
Can that be good for you? Can't be, no,

746
00:39:12,401 --> 00:39:14,620
it can't be. Yeah. Especially the pills.

747
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:17,890
A lot of them get caught or the pain
pills if you're caught up on pain pills,

748
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,150
that's a, that's a big one, man.

749
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:21,790
We just found out a Tom petty
died from fucking pain pills.

750
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:25,210
My wife and I were talking about sad.
That was that a man,

751
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,800
he couldn't have a sense of a,

752
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,570
because at my wife and I both love
Tom Petty music, but how he did, how,

753
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,960
how at 66 years old,

754
00:39:31,961 --> 00:39:36,961
he was still like not so okay with
himself that he was jamming pills down his

755
00:39:37,091 --> 00:39:40,480
throat, you know, that he
didn't have a sense of, I have
had great accomplishments.

756
00:39:40,481 --> 00:39:43,880
I've had to create life. You know, I
have people around me that love me that,

757
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,460
you know, I mean, it's gotta be a sad,

758
00:39:45,461 --> 00:39:48,790
lonely thing when you're overdosing
on pills. I would have to assume,

759
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,940
well, I mean, I don't want
to guess, but I would,

760
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,740
I would imagine he's in some
kind of pain if it was free,

761
00:39:53,741 --> 00:39:57,320
is taking those opiates hip
fracture he was recovering from, ah,

762
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:00,960
I got hooked on them, man. My
friend from the amber from the UFC,

763
00:40:00,961 --> 00:40:02,280
she hurt her ankle recently.

764
00:40:02,281 --> 00:40:06,090
She blew out her a Achilles and she
said the doctor immediately tried to

765
00:40:06,091 --> 00:40:10,140
prescribe oxycontin. She was like, got
the fuck out of here. Yeah. She's like,

766
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:15,120
I'm not taking that shit. No. And
you know, um, it happens, man.

767
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:19,380
Doctors just try to shove pills down
your throat. It's a real common thing.

768
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,920
And if you have any sort of serious
injury and they put you on that stuff,

769
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:27,690
one of the things they put Tom Penny on
was fentanyl and fentanyl is that shit

770
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:32,610
that's fucking killing. Everybody took
meth. Meth are very similar. No heroin.

771
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,920
It's a extreme deal. Heroin. Yeah. It's
an extremely potent opiate. Yeah. It's,

772
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,680
it's much more, much more potent
than heroin. I didn't many,

773
00:40:40,681 --> 00:40:42,470
many hundreds of times more potent.
Yeah.

774
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:45,780
And so they give these people fentanyl
patches and then they're taken

775
00:40:45,781 --> 00:40:50,410
oxycontin's too. And who knows what
else. I take it and I mean, I, I've,

776
00:40:50,411 --> 00:40:54,150
I feel terrible for someone who
has bad pain, like, you know,

777
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:55,680
from a broken hip or something like that.

778
00:40:55,681 --> 00:41:00,060
But Jesus Christ take the pain
rather than death. Seriously,

779
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,580
this shit you could take CBD,
you can take CBD.

780
00:41:02,581 --> 00:41:05,850
It doesn't even have a psychoactive
effect and as radical pain reducing

781
00:41:05,851 --> 00:41:07,730
properties to, yeah.
Yeah. And I, and I, I,

782
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:08,691
I don't do drugs,

783
00:41:08,691 --> 00:41:13,340
but the fact that people are
so actively prescribing these,

784
00:41:13,341 --> 00:41:16,570
these heavy,
really heavy hard drugs to patients,

785
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:19,700
people kill people and weed is still
illegal. And I don't smoke weed,

786
00:41:19,701 --> 00:41:23,270
so I'm not even like for myself,
but just for other people.

787
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:26,670
Well, that's crazy. We need
to be a pain reliever. Really.

788
00:41:26,671 --> 00:41:29,910
I've heard a lot of people say no. A lot
of people do say that. It's just maybe,

789
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:34,580
I don't know. I just, I'm one
of those people that you're in,

790
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:38,420
if you're in pain, just be in
pain. Just like, just, just, yes.

791
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:42,800
Just relax, you know? I mean,
I remember one time though,
I got my knee operated on,

792
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:46,940
I had an ACL reconstruction and they
gave me one of those buttons in the

793
00:41:46,941 --> 00:41:51,340
hospital. You press it and you get more
fun. And uh, it was when, uh, they,

794
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:56,330
they had my leg on this motion machine.
Right. So like right after surgery,

795
00:41:56,331 --> 00:41:58,190
they're trying to get your blood moving.

796
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:02,540
And so there's a couple of screws in
there and they'd taken my patella tendon

797
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:05,600
and cut it and put it inside and
drilled it all in place and everything.

798
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,900
And then I'm sitting at, it's, this
thing's just, it's this throbbing pain.

799
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,220
And they gave me this little
button. I'm like, clap, clap.

800
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,120
But I'm like, I'm in the hospital.
I'm not going to overdose. But uh,

801
00:42:17,121 --> 00:42:18,140
I remember thinking,
wow,

802
00:42:18,141 --> 00:42:20,630
this could be really fucking
dangerous if you had this in life.

803
00:42:20,631 --> 00:42:24,380
Like it was like a little button on your
hip and you just press it and you get a

804
00:42:24,381 --> 00:42:26,630
dose of morphine.
But it was a wonderful feeling.

805
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:29,480
I've only done it once
while I was in the hospital.

806
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:34,010
I got it for that brief moment. I was
like, wow, this is an amazing feeling.

807
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:35,150
It feel like,

808
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,830
like you're floating through a cloud of
love and just flying through the air.

809
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,650
Like, ah, I went from being
in exacerbating pain too.

810
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,950
So how, how do you feel then we,
so we got in this discussion,

811
00:42:45,951 --> 00:42:49,160
we're talking about
CTE. So now like, okay,

812
00:42:49,161 --> 00:42:53,060
I think MMA is a terrible career path
and people ask me all the time as a

813
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,950
professional MMA fighter,
two different,

814
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,310
two different organizations
or like a couple people.

815
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:03,530
It's probably the right career
path for majority of people.

816
00:43:03,531 --> 00:43:06,230
Probably not a great career
path, but so, you know,

817
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,500
how do you feel about it when you think
that you, I mean you're obviously saying,

818
00:43:09,501 --> 00:43:10,490
and I'm on the fence,

819
00:43:10,491 --> 00:43:13,760
but you're saying I think a lot of
these people aren't getting CTE clearly.

820
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,970
How do you feel about, you
know, being involved with it?

821
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:20,120
Cause that's like in my future
I could probably coach them MMA,

822
00:43:20,121 --> 00:43:23,540
but I struggle with it because it's like,
well,

823
00:43:23,541 --> 00:43:25,730
should I really recommend this person?
Do you have a mayor? Should I not?

824
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:28,700
Because are they gonna end up fucked up
and not be able to take care of the kids

825
00:43:28,701 --> 00:43:31,970
are aware. I don't think you should ever
recommend MMA to anybody. Okay, good.

826
00:43:31,971 --> 00:43:34,960
I usually don't,
I don't think anybody should recommend it.

827
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:38,060
But I think some people,
it's their destiny. Yeah.

828
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:41,880
There's a few people out there
that they want to, oh look,

829
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:46,130
I don't think you should
recommend skydiving to anybody
either though career to

830
00:43:46,131 --> 00:43:46,910
that.

831
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:51,670
I mean my friend Andy stumped is a
world record holder of squirrel flies.

832
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:56,830
That's, that's this death. Did you ever
read there was that book called uh,

833
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:01,990
something chasing superman or do you
remember talking about it was about people

834
00:44:02,061 --> 00:44:07,061
like him and how it almost always ends
up very poorly because you need this

835
00:44:07,461 --> 00:44:09,740
bigger rush and this bigger
rush and this bigger rush.

836
00:44:09,741 --> 00:44:13,250
I was telling him big wave surfers
in the flying suit and all of this,

837
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:18,020
I was talking about the psychology behind
it and how like it ends up poorly very,

838
00:44:18,021 --> 00:44:18,291
very,

839
00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:21,950
very often because these people need
bigger rushes and more challenges and the

840
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,660
end up fucking themselves up.
It only makes sense.

841
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,790
Yeah. I would never encourage
anyone to do that. But for him,

842
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:32,150
I mean he's a retired navy seal and
this is just another level of psychotic

843
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:34,980
shit we can do to fill his time with.

844
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,040
But he's got a bunch of sponsors and
he actually makes a living doing that.

845
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:42,900
I would never recommend that to anybody.
I wouldn't recommend skiing. You know,

846
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,770
my kids liked skiing. I don't even like
skiing. I go skiing with them every time.

847
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:50,430
I skied like, no, I've never gotten
hurt. But I'm like, fuck that.

848
00:44:50,431 --> 00:44:52,710
Every time I'm skiing though, I'm
like, don't get hurt. Don't get hurt.

849
00:44:52,711 --> 00:44:55,680
Don't get hurt. Who wouldn't get hurt?
Don't get hurt. Don't get hurt. Oh,

850
00:44:55,681 --> 00:44:59,430
I think it's Sonny
Bono. Oh Geez. Who else?

851
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:02,370
One of the Kennedy's in a tree.
Right then maybe that was a,

852
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,480
that could have been false flag.

853
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,410
No one could have been right until
we'll push them into the tree. Yeah.

854
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,570
Fuck it took a ski out
with a sniper rifle,

855
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,850
but I wouldn't go too close to the woods.
Yeah.

856
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,860
I think that there's a lot of very,

857
00:45:13,861 --> 00:45:18,861
very dangerous career and I think
if you feel compelled to do that,

858
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:21,750
no one should be talking you into that.
But yeah,

859
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:26,250
I don't think anybody should stop you.
Like, I like the fact that boxing exists,

860
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,420
you know, would never want to tell. You
know the Civil Lowman Chanko don't fight.

861
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:33,000
Sure. I don't know. I would never
want to tell him don't fight.

862
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:36,270
I want to see him fight. Well,
what if they, what if, uh,

863
00:45:36,271 --> 00:45:40,230
it gets proven without a shadow of a
doubt that these things cause he, he CTE.

864
00:45:40,231 --> 00:45:42,660
Do you think the government
is going to ban them? No,

865
00:45:42,661 --> 00:45:44,940
I don't think they can really.
How could they be?

866
00:45:44,941 --> 00:45:48,780
Are they going to ban the government?
Like banning everything they really do.

867
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:53,100
They like banning things that cost them
money or the cost people who don't end

868
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:54,460
up to them money.
Fair enough.

869
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:58,490
The banning of the drugs is really tied
to pharmaceutical drugs more than a year.

870
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:01,500
They're not banning it because
they're trying to save us.

871
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:04,830
They're banning it because someone's
putting pressure on them to ban it or had

872
00:46:04,831 --> 00:46:07,860
put it in the past and they're,
nobody's banning a skateboarding.

873
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:11,970
No one's trying to ban BMX ride.
Those guys kept fucked up. I mean,

874
00:46:11,971 --> 00:46:14,970
I was watching this video the other day
of those guys doing the ramp with the

875
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:18,600
skateboard and the guy got to the top of
the ramp and didn't catch it right and

876
00:46:18,601 --> 00:46:22,290
fell like a hundred feet awful.
Oh Jesus Christ.

877
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:24,000
I mean they get beat the foot that's up.

878
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:27,840
That's another one where the
damn book chasing soup man,

879
00:46:27,841 --> 00:46:30,720
or being superman mad at something.
Nothing. Superman coding. Superman.

880
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:33,840
I decoding superman was called
the coding superman. Yeah. Okay.

881
00:46:33,841 --> 00:46:36,960
So like if you go back and watch the
original x games when I, you know,

882
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:41,160
I was a kid, I don't remember what year
it is, nineties at some point. And uh, oh,

883
00:46:41,161 --> 00:46:44,310
the rise of the Superman, decoding the
science of ultimate human performance.

884
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:48,770
This is a, this is a freaking fantastic
book. I mean it's like, it's so awesome.

885
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:53,000
I'm so, I'm obsessed with sports psych.
Like I said, I'm sure Steven Kotler. Yeah,

886
00:46:53,001 --> 00:46:54,630
that guy's interesting.
Yeah.

887
00:46:54,631 --> 00:46:58,680
But so if you look at like the original
x game stuff and then you go to like the

888
00:46:58,681 --> 00:47:02,190
x games today. Oh yeah. It's different
world. Yeah. Totally different events.

889
00:47:02,191 --> 00:47:06,390
So much more extreme because you there,
it has to be this advanced, advanced,

890
00:47:06,391 --> 00:47:09,240
advanced, advanced, but then all of a
sudden people are getting left up. Yeah.

891
00:47:09,241 --> 00:47:12,540
You get to a certain point where you can
only do so many flips in the air with

892
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:17,220
your bike. Apparently they tried to
go more. I would do one rotation.

893
00:47:17,221 --> 00:47:18,390
Everybody go, this is crazy. Yeah.

894
00:47:18,391 --> 00:47:20,910
Somebody that comes along with two
and then now they're doing three.

895
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:21,460
Wasn't there?

896
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:25,710
The movie about a Tony Hawk was like the
first one did the seven 20 or something.

897
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:28,020
But now they go way
more, don't they? Yeah.

898
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:30,940
It's and going to be more in every year.

899
00:47:30,941 --> 00:47:35,380
And if you watch any of those par core
kids that are building to building and,

900
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:38,860
and we've had one of them are in
here. What was his name? James.

901
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:39,743
He's a

902
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:43,730
find it. I don't know. I'm sorry.

903
00:47:43,731 --> 00:47:47,060
That one I listen to mostly
you're a political ones.

904
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,400
I think some of the people you bring
in are highly fascinating. Yeah. It's,

905
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:54,620
it's an interesting time. W I get
labeled outright. I know it's bizarre,

906
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:59,580
but everybody's so quick to label
people today. It's such a strange time.

907
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:04,050
Finger pointing and putting people
in boxes. Disingenuously it's,

908
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:08,330
it's more divisive. They, a lot of
these leftist, they want to, uh,

909
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:12,560
you know, they want to say, well, I'm
trying to make people less racist,

910
00:48:12,561 --> 00:48:15,110
but what they're really doing, they're
being very divisive. Yeah. You know,

911
00:48:15,111 --> 00:48:18,200
and like I would,
I think you identify as libertarian.

912
00:48:18,201 --> 00:48:22,190
I W I identify more as a libertarian
than Republican or Democrat. But yeah,

913
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:26,570
a lot of people say, I'm all right
or love Trump so much and it's, well,

914
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:29,990
I'm more libertarian than anything.
I think less government,

915
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:31,970
less invasion into our lives.

916
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:35,420
But people want to put you into a little
box because you don't agree with what

917
00:48:35,421 --> 00:48:37,850
they're saying. Yeah. It's
a weird time for that.

918
00:48:37,851 --> 00:48:40,310
And W I think what you
were saying about shaming,

919
00:48:40,311 --> 00:48:42,650
they tried to shame you
into this racist or shame,

920
00:48:42,651 --> 00:48:45,950
but you're not doing that if you're
pretending someone's racist when you know

921
00:48:45,951 --> 00:48:46,784
they're not.

922
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:50,780
Or if you're pretending that someone
is a sexist or homophobic or whatever,

923
00:48:50,781 --> 00:48:53,300
when you know that you're just,
people are,

924
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:57,230
they're ignoring nuance.
Yeah. And what, and what's,

925
00:48:57,231 --> 00:48:59,180
what they're really doing
also is they're making,

926
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:02,540
they're making people afraid to speak
their minds. Right. And really how,

927
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:04,820
if you and I had a
disagreement on something,

928
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:09,140
how we would come to a common ground
is by discussing it. I'd say, well,

929
00:49:09,141 --> 00:49:12,080
I think your result person, what do
you believe? Then you'd say, well,

930
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,910
I don't agree with that and this is why.

931
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:16,430
And eventually we would talk it
out and maybe we still disagree,

932
00:49:16,431 --> 00:49:20,450
but we'd come to a common ground. Right?
But instead the people on the one side,

933
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,620
they're not saying that they're saying,

934
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:26,360
what'd you say you're racist or sexist
or homophobic, nay, nay. Name one. Right.

935
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:29,390
And then ended discussion. Then there's
no discussion at all. Right? Yeah.

936
00:49:29,391 --> 00:49:31,280
They're trying to win. Yeah, exactly.

937
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:34,160
They just turned on when they're trying
to label you and then get the upper hand.

938
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:38,090
And yeah, I think there's a real problem
with people not being reasonable.

939
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:41,270
And I think that you should be able
to have conversations like I've had,

940
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:44,990
people have criticized me, uh,
even in person I've taught,

941
00:49:44,991 --> 00:49:47,930
like why would you have that
guy on your show? Which one?

942
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,860
Any guy like a Milo Yiannopoulos,
perfect example. And I'm like,

943
00:49:51,861 --> 00:49:53,420
well look what happened.
I mean,

944
00:49:53,421 --> 00:49:55,940
we got to see how the guy
thinks God got mean all,

945
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:59,480
all of his weird issues that came
up and his book deal falling apart.

946
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:02,000
A lot of that had to do with
conversations I had with him. Yeah.

947
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:05,570
It's like now you get to chance to
see how the guy actually thinks.

948
00:50:05,571 --> 00:50:08,900
And I don't think there's anything wrong
with the way he thinks. I think it's a,

949
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:12,430
he's a provocateur. I mean
it's not how I think. Yeah.

950
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:17,500
But I think that everybody
has this perspective on who
he is that is exaggerated

951
00:50:19,191 --> 00:50:22,880
because of this public persona
that he does that to be outrageous.

952
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,890
So I think that's a double
edged sword because I think,

953
00:50:24,891 --> 00:50:29,660
I think Alex Jones does it as well. Alex,
where way crazier than well, but okay.

954
00:50:29,661 --> 00:50:31,940
But same idea, right? Is like, yes,

955
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:34,790
part of their persona is a show is a show.

956
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:38,930
It's making it more extreme because
they want to say that one thing that's

957
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:42,230
totally effing crazy. It'll catch
a headline somewhere. Right.

958
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:44,330
And so they have these beliefs,

959
00:50:44,331 --> 00:50:48,110
but then they kind of go beyond them
because it is a show and because they will

960
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:51,020
make more money if they get more
followers or more people clicking on the

961
00:50:51,021 --> 00:50:55,040
articles. Are there videos or whatever.
So I think it is, but then you know,

962
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:57,860
you go to someone like the Bret
Weinstein Guy, I think he's fascinating.

963
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,770
People calling him a racist and you know,

964
00:51:00,771 --> 00:51:04,460
he was strong liberal and he's
as progressive as it gets.

965
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:08,060
He's as far from a racist as you
could ever get. Yeah, yeah. There's a,

966
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:11,000
there's this need to label people.
Well Alex is,

967
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:15,460
Alex is a showman and
but also like he says,

968
00:51:15,461 --> 00:51:18,380
some things that are pretty fucked up,
like the sandy hook stuff,

969
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:20,100
you know what I'm saying?
The Sandy Hook was a us.

970
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:24,200
He's looking for conspiracies everywhere.
Everywhere.

971
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:28,130
He finds them some places.
So sometimes he's, right.
Exactly. Sometimes he's right.

972
00:51:28,131 --> 00:51:28,311
Yeah.

973
00:51:28,311 --> 00:51:31,960
But the problem with looking
for conspiracies everywhere
as you are going to,

974
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:35,530
you're going to make people feel terrible.
Yes.

975
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:40,820
There was an article that I read about a
guy who was a conspiracy theorist until

976
00:51:40,821 --> 00:51:45,821
his son was killed in Sandy
Hook was people were telling
him that his son wasn't

977
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:50,390
killed and that is some sort
of a government actor and
this guy was devastated.

978
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,253
Yeah.
You know,

979
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,380
of course the people that are really
the nutty conspiracy theorist, Oh,

980
00:51:54,381 --> 00:51:57,700
you're spoken undercover still.
You're still under Grover.

981
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:02,750
There's people out there that look
for conspiracies. Yeah. Everything.

982
00:52:02,751 --> 00:52:05,810
And it becomes a real problem because
it muddies up the water. But I think,

983
00:52:05,811 --> 00:52:08,630
I think at the same time,
you, at least for me,

984
00:52:08,631 --> 00:52:11,300
and I think we have
similar thought processes,

985
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:14,030
you can't just take what mainstream
media tells you and say, well,

986
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:18,200
I guess that's how it happened.
Right. So as an in some situations,

987
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:22,850
but in Sandy Hook, you have dead kids
of people grieving. You have bodies,

988
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:27,620
autopsy reports. Yeah. It happened.
Yeah, absolutely. I know had guns.

989
00:52:27,621 --> 00:52:30,790
You had a mentally ill person
who had access to these guns.

990
00:52:30,791 --> 00:52:32,890
Then if you take that same
thought process on say,

991
00:52:32,891 --> 00:52:34,760
Stephen Paddock in the Las Vegas shooting,

992
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:37,070
well we still don't know
how that turned out, right?

993
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:40,490
The Las Vegas shooting is complicated,
but as we know,

994
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:44,120
one guy did do that well now
coming out with new stuff,

995
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:47,450
I think there was other people involved
and he might've gotten help from people,

996
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:51,920
whether it's willingly or unwillingly,
but or wittingly or unwittingly.

997
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:55,160
But I don't think there was other
people shooting. They've said that.

998
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:58,040
So I don't know. Right. And that's
what the law of these conspiracies,

999
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:00,770
you'd have to understand that you're never
really gonna know what the real truth.

1000
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:03,200
Right? Right. You have to keep it
open mind and you'll say, okay,

1001
00:53:03,201 --> 00:53:06,530
well this person says this. What does this
person say? What does this person say?

1002
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:08,600
Do these things,
check out with each other.

1003
00:53:08,601 --> 00:53:11,450
And it's like how many different times
have they changed the Las Vegas shootings

1004
00:53:11,451 --> 00:53:12,320
timeline?
Right.

1005
00:53:12,321 --> 00:53:16,100
And then it was kind of weird that
it went way out of mainstream media.

1006
00:53:16,101 --> 00:53:18,860
Like I'll send you heard about it for a
week and then you didn't hear about it

1007
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:23,120
again. Sign of the times, I think the new
cycle. Today's about Tony Hours. Yeah.

1008
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:26,040
But you would think people want answers.
I mean

1009
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,580
that's the largest mass shooting
in United States history.

1010
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:32,280
I think we'd want some more clear answers
on what really happened and how it

1011
00:53:32,281 --> 00:53:35,880
happened and why it happened. Um,
and we never really got those.

1012
00:53:35,881 --> 00:53:39,270
And I know there's been a few new
articles on it recently and so maybe we're

1013
00:53:39,271 --> 00:53:42,750
going to find out more information,
but it's an incredibly confusing story.

1014
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:46,530
Absolutely. The guy was clearly
a psycho and clearly fucked up.

1015
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:50,470
I'm clearly planned this out
for a long time. I mean he,

1016
00:53:50,471 --> 00:53:54,950
he got hotel rooms overlooking music
festivals and other places. Yeah.

1017
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:57,990
And like was planning out how
to do this for a long time.

1018
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,540
He had a note in his,
uh,

1019
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:05,050
in his hotel room that had all the
ballistics calculation, so he knew like,

1020
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:09,720
like bullet drop from x amount of yards
and he was calculating how to kill all

1021
00:54:09,721 --> 00:54:10,554
these people.
Yeah.

1022
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:15,650
He was on some weird antidepressants
and anti not anti anxiety medication,

1023
00:54:16,261 --> 00:54:18,120
which does all kinds of
weird shit to your head.

1024
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:22,620
There's a guy that was prone
to fits of rage. He was a,

1025
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:27,540
a calculated professional gambler. There's
a lot of weird stuff with this guy.

1026
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:31,320
The fact that he accumulated
these weapons over years. Yeah,

1027
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:36,590
and maybe did it knowing that he
was going to do this so you don't,

1028
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:40,770
there's a, whenever there's a mass
shooting or anything, that's crazy.

1029
00:54:40,771 --> 00:54:42,090
You have two things happen.
One,

1030
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,780
everybody wants answers and to everybody
forgets about it really quick because

1031
00:54:45,781 --> 00:54:49,020
some new shit happens in the news and
if it wasn't your family that got shot,

1032
00:54:49,021 --> 00:54:50,670
it wasn't someone that you're
close to that got shot.

1033
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,060
I know people that got shot there.
I know people that I met them.

1034
00:54:54,061 --> 00:54:56,250
I met people in Vegas
that that got shot there.

1035
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,540
I talked to them after it was over.

1036
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:03,320
It was complete and total chaos and
when there's complete and total chaos,

1037
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,180
you get all sorts of conflicting reports.

1038
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:09,300
People were running into other casinos
saying that there's a shooter because

1039
00:55:09,301 --> 00:55:12,540
they ran out of that area and so then
people were calling and police reports.

1040
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:14,940
There's a shooter in the Monte Carlo,
there's a shooter in this.

1041
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:19,110
And so those things get reported as
fact when many times it's a part of the

1042
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:22,890
confusion of a chaotic mass shooting.
Like that Vegas event.

1043
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:27,210
I don't know what happened other than
the fact that this one guy definitely

1044
00:55:27,211 --> 00:55:28,290
killed a bunch of people,

1045
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:31,080
but whether or not someone was helping
him or whether or not there was other

1046
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:34,830
people involved or I think they're still
investigating as to, yeah, and it's, but,

1047
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:37,950
so I guess my, my greater
point there would be that, uh,

1048
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:39,810
if you're an intelligent individual,

1049
00:55:39,811 --> 00:55:44,340
you can't just take what cvs tells
you to be complete fact, right? You,

1050
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,320
you go do some investigation yourself,

1051
00:55:46,321 --> 00:55:49,830
you try to read from different
sources and then, Hey, sandy hook,

1052
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:54,900
I think there's like a 99.999999999%
chance of Sandy Hook was real.

1053
00:55:54,901 --> 00:55:55,650
Right.

1054
00:55:55,650 --> 00:56:00,300
Is there some crazy in the impetus of the
small chance that didn't happen? Sure.

1055
00:56:00,301 --> 00:56:02,880
Right. But I think, I don't think
there is, I think it's very unlikely.

1056
00:56:02,881 --> 00:56:06,450
And this a Vegas was a 0% zero.
Sandy, Sandy Hook didn't happen.

1057
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:11,190
So I looked into it pretty, you know,
it's just sad to me. And you're a dad,

1058
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,270
you know the idea of your kid going to
school and getting their school getting

1059
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:17,310
shot up by some psychopath.
Yeah.

1060
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:21,030
Imagine if someone was saying that that
was fake. Yeah. After your kid's dead,

1061
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:24,670
you'd be frustrated,
infuriated,

1062
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:26,200
you wouldn't even know where to turn.

1063
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,320
And these that's actually happening
to these people and they're,

1064
00:56:29,321 --> 00:56:33,940
they're getting labeled as, as frauds
and people are emailing them and saying,

1065
00:56:33,941 --> 00:56:37,150
how could you do this? You're, you're
defrauding the American people.

1066
00:56:37,151 --> 00:56:38,620
You're a part of the Illuminati or,

1067
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:43,760
yeah. So, well, I think so. I
think there's obviously those
people who are on, right.

1068
00:56:43,761 --> 00:56:47,930
The way one side of it,
there's so there's, so if you
go a spectrum for me, right?

1069
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:51,620
There's the American who's drinking
diet coke and eating frozen pizza and

1070
00:56:51,621 --> 00:56:55,280
listening to every CPS says, right? And
then in the total opposite of spectrum,

1071
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:58,680
there's the group that thinks every single
thing that ever happens in America as

1072
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,820
a, as a planned conspiracy by
the new world order. Right?

1073
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:03,230
So those are two ends of
the spectrum right now.

1074
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,000
We can fall anywhere in the middle there.
But I,

1075
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:07,010
so I think as an intelligent individual,

1076
00:57:07,011 --> 00:57:11,000
we look at situations independently and
say, well, there's some sketchy things.

1077
00:57:11,001 --> 00:57:13,730
They're not sketchy things there.
That's probably true. Right.

1078
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,160
And kind of independently think
about stuff by ourselves and that's,

1079
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:20,240
that's how I do it. And so, you know,
that's a wise way to approach it. Yeah.

1080
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:24,970
And uh, I think CBS or NBC or you
know, any name, your new source,

1081
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:27,790
they're run by people.
And if they weren't there,

1082
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,710
they only have access to a
certain amount of information.

1083
00:57:29,711 --> 00:57:33,460
And sometimes they get bad information
and sometimes they don't necessarily know.

1084
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:37,090
I don't know how much of it is a part
of some grand conspiracy rather than how

1085
00:57:37,091 --> 00:57:40,330
much of it is a part of
the chaos of these moments.

1086
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:44,980
The lack of information and
people drawing conclusions and,

1087
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:49,180
and then also witnesses on the scene and
people on the scene of something that's

1088
00:57:49,181 --> 00:57:52,960
crazy. They give all sorts of
weird accounts and they're just,

1089
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:55,810
they're filled with adrenaline. They
don't know how to handle the situation.

1090
00:57:55,811 --> 00:57:59,530
People, you know, the people don't
handle chaotic events very well.

1091
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:04,620
Yeah. But I don't think the earth flat
if that's fair. Well, good for you. Yeah.

1092
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:09,210
What do you, what do you possibly
believe in? That might be crazy.

1093
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:14,580
Can I take a piss in it? I'll tell you. I
got to go fast. Go ahead. No worries man.

1094
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:18,810
I wonder if there's something wrong with
my bladder that you can hold it. Yeah.

1095
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,660
Do you think I've trained
it? Yeah. I mean, sure.

1096
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:25,440
I just had guys going to try to shoot
himself to see the flat earth and a couple

1097
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:25,800
of days.
Oh,

1098
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:30,660
you guys shoot himself up into the space
and don't take March 2nd James Kingston,

1099
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:35,610
James Kingston. Thank you. Sorry
James. Yeah. Bam. Yeah, it's a Dunbar.

1100
00:58:35,611 --> 00:58:38,080
There is Dunbar's number, brother. Uh,

1101
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:40,800
you can only keep 150 people
in your brain at any time.

1102
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:42,090
Look at that fucking picture.

1103
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:45,540
We're looking at a picture for the audio
folks of James Kingston on the top of

1104
00:58:45,541 --> 00:58:49,740
this tower. And I don't know how
many fucking stories he's up there,

1105
00:58:49,741 --> 00:58:51,750
but it's insane because below him,

1106
00:58:51,751 --> 00:58:54,930
and I mean way below him are skyscrapers.

1107
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,670
That's probably like Dubai or something.
Right.

1108
00:58:56,930 --> 00:59:00,230
Do you think that Dunbar's number could
apply to other things besides people

1109
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:03,790
like websites or numbers of
instructions? Exactly. Yeah. Yeah,

1110
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:08,380
yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think so.
You know, I think it, uh, it
applies to too many things.

1111
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:13,270
Uh, it applies, I just think
for names, names and people,

1112
00:59:13,271 --> 00:59:15,100
I'm,
I'm struggling.

1113
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,650
I think I'm getting like I have
a overflowing pot, like, um,

1114
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:21,980
um,
shame Burgos

1115
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:25,280
and Calvin cater. We're fighting this
weekend and I called Calvin Cater,

1116
00:59:25,281 --> 00:59:28,880
Chris Cater after he won, even though
I'm a fan of his, like he wanted,

1117
00:59:28,881 --> 00:59:32,410
I went Chris Cater and then I'm like,
it's fucking name's Calvin dumb cunt.

1118
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:37,430
Like I just don't, I think I'm running
out of space in my head for names.

1119
00:59:37,431 --> 00:59:42,140
So my apologies to Calvin cater.
I'm running out of names and my,

1120
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:43,880
we're talking about Dunbar's number,

1121
00:59:43,881 --> 00:59:47,810
how you can only keep so many people
in your brain. My brain's overflowed.

1122
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:50,070
I don't have any hard drive space left.
I didn't know.

1123
00:59:50,071 --> 00:59:54,560
So I thought it was a is that the guy
says you can only like keep track of 150

1124
00:59:54,561 --> 00:59:57,770
people like what's going on in the
relationships and that kind of stuff.

1125
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:01,980
You only have so much room in your,
in your hard drive space. Yeah.

1126
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,010
It's based on a tribal societies.

1127
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:07,910
Like our brains are sort of designed
to keep track of 150 people.

1128
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:10,960
That's how we evolved and
then over the last, you know,

1129
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:12,380
x amount of hundreds of years,

1130
01:00:12,381 --> 01:00:15,620
now all of a sudden you have to keep
track of many, many multiples of that.

1131
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:20,270
Especially if you're someone like you or
I that runs into so many people who you,

1132
01:00:20,271 --> 01:00:24,140
you, you meet on a regular basis. Got
to keep those people all in your brain.

1133
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:27,890
But is it, is it, so I guess I haven't
read that. Read it an edge. A bunch.

1134
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:31,370
Is it that you have to just
know their names and faces,

1135
01:00:31,371 --> 01:00:33,530
or is it that you have to know
like what's going on in their life?

1136
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:38,270
I think you're supposed to be able to
track them, like have a, some sort of a,

1137
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:43,340
whether it's intimate or
personal relationship with
these people know them. Yeah.

1138
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:45,380
So it's like there's only something like,

1139
01:00:45,381 --> 01:00:48,290
especially if you think about
a commentating on fights,

1140
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:51,380
I have to pay attention to these guys
and what they're doing and their career.

1141
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,500
And there's hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of 500 fighters now,

1142
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:59,390
500 fighters that's active. And then how
many of them get re new guys come in,

1143
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:02,240
old guy go away. I still keep
them all in my head. Hey,

1144
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:06,680
what's Sean sherk up to
these days? They're all still
in the head and it's like,

1145
01:01:06,681 --> 01:01:09,870
there's not, there's only so much room.
And after a while you will, you'll wonder,

1146
01:01:09,871 --> 01:01:12,500
you're like, wow, where are
all these people going? Yeah.

1147
01:01:12,501 --> 01:01:17,420
And I found that obviously with the, it's
sad, like, you know, college friends,

1148
01:01:17,421 --> 01:01:18,260
it's like, yeah, you know,

1149
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:21,080
and it's good because you see him and
it's like no time has passed. Right.

1150
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:24,560
But it's like I, if I, if I know
if I was live in two minutes way,

1151
01:01:24,561 --> 01:01:28,190
we'd probably be best friends
still. Right. But now I
get to see you once a year,

1152
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:32,510
twice a year maybe. I can't keep up
with you, dude. It's super challenging.

1153
01:01:32,511 --> 01:01:35,170
I totally agree. And you're now max
and I run the rest of the academies.

1154
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:35,930
My brother,

1155
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:40,520
we have three in Wisconsin and it's like
this fall was my first wife fulltime,

1156
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:44,510
worked at one and so now I'm
really immersed in the one academy,

1157
01:01:44,511 --> 01:01:47,750
whereas I was kind of loosely
keeping track of all three.

1158
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:50,210
But now that I'm kind of
totally immersed in the one,

1159
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:54,320
I find it a lot harder to keep track
of what's going on at the other two,

1160
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:58,280
whereas kind of bed read it before
when I wasn't so immersed in one. Yeah.

1161
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:01,890
I can only imagine Eddie Bravo is a
hundred schools. That's crazy. Right?

1162
01:02:01,891 --> 01:02:06,360
It's 110 plan. Jujitsu's worldwide. Like
how he can't keep check all uncanny.

1163
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:09,950
I don't know. I don't know. I'd have to
ask him. I know he travels to all of them.

1164
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:13,460
He travels, he's constantly traveling.
I traveled all a travels constantly.

1165
01:02:13,461 --> 01:02:17,210
He's doing seminars at all of, oh
my gosh. Always traveling. Yeah.

1166
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:20,010
Once he is so easy to do like
one time year for each facility.

1167
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:20,320
Right.

1168
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:23,260
I don't know. It's a good question. That
would be the Columbia he's going to,

1169
01:02:23,261 --> 01:02:25,170
he's going, I mean you probably
wouldn't even be once a year. Yeah.

1170
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:28,930
He's three years Singapore
now. Yeah. He's everywhere.

1171
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:32,290
He was out in Singapore when I was there
and uh, one of my fights this year,

1172
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:35,350
it was maybe the, maybe the
May fight. Yeah, I think, yeah,

1173
01:02:35,351 --> 01:02:38,230
he was out there doing is a 10th
planet seminar and now that,

1174
01:02:38,231 --> 01:02:41,680
and now they have a 10th planet
program at evolve is crazy.

1175
01:02:41,890 --> 01:02:45,490
Evolve is supposed to be an amazing
facility. I've heard some amazing, yeah,

1176
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:49,720
it's Fab. I mean the, the
nicest MMA facility I've ever
been to. And so they have,

1177
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:52,300
they actually just opened their
fourth location. Justin Singapore,

1178
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:57,010
which Singapore is a city state, right?
It's 6 million people in a, on a really,

1179
01:02:57,011 --> 01:02:59,920
really small island.
But some of their,

1180
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:04,510
some of their academies are only a mile
or two apart. Like they're not far apart,

1181
01:03:04,511 --> 01:03:08,350
but the population density is
such that, you know, they listen,

1182
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:13,000
they start classes at I think at 6:00 AM
and they end class at 11:00 PM and you

1183
01:03:13,001 --> 01:03:16,930
can freaking stop in anytime of day and
there'll be a class there that's full

1184
01:03:16,931 --> 01:03:20,980
with Muay Thai or Jujitsu, whatever
you name it, it will be going on.

1185
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:25,380
That's great. Yeah. Well Manhattan is
kind of like that in a lot of ways, right?

1186
01:03:25,381 --> 01:03:30,180
Manhattan is how many Jujitsu schools are
in Manhattan? I mean obviously Marcel,

1187
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:33,270
yeah, there's hundreds, but really
nick one's Hendel has got a huge one.

1188
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,570
Marcel has got a huge one, so
yeah, there's a lot right there.

1189
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:41,790
Handles is huge. And that places enormous.
Hundreds and hundreds of students.

1190
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:44,880
I thought that, no, I thought it was
thousands. That's what somebody told me.

1191
01:03:44,881 --> 01:03:45,980
Hanzo has over a thousand

1192
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:50,630
students in the main New York
City location. And I think it's,

1193
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,810
you know, it ain't cheap
cause you got to pay for rent.

1194
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:56,910
Mm. And so they're probably paying a
couple hundred bucks a month. Yeah.

1195
01:03:56,911 --> 01:03:57,920
Of still have of all right.

1196
01:03:57,990 --> 01:04:02,310
Is I think $350 a month.
Wow. But obviously,

1197
01:04:02,311 --> 01:04:04,980
so Singapore is one of the most
wealthy countries on the planet.

1198
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:08,250
So you have to take that new account
approach. Everyone that lives there,

1199
01:04:08,251 --> 01:04:11,970
it has a, a decent amount of wealth and
you know, it, they spend it differently.

1200
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:15,750
Singapore is a fascinating
country. If you, I, I, you know,

1201
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:17,490
I was there 15 times or whatever,

1202
01:04:17,491 --> 01:04:20,490
so I got kind of immersed in the culture
and then ended up reading the books

1203
01:04:20,491 --> 01:04:23,310
about Lee Kuan Yew, the guy who
started the country. And so, you know,

1204
01:04:23,311 --> 01:04:25,020
there was a whole bunch
of those Asian countries,

1205
01:04:25,021 --> 01:04:29,220
they got independence in
the 1950s and sixties. Um,

1206
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:32,490
and Singapore I blew was founded in 1965.

1207
01:04:32,491 --> 01:04:36,000
It could be off by one year
there maybe. Um, but you know,

1208
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:40,440
a lot of those countries are not doing
super well economically and Singapore is

1209
01:04:40,441 --> 01:04:40,651
like,

1210
01:04:40,651 --> 01:04:45,651
this is freaking stand out country who's
like top five world per person wealth

1211
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:50,070
and why, why, why are they
doing so much better? Uh,

1212
01:04:50,071 --> 01:04:53,400
and so this is me from an
outsider's perspective. So um,

1213
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:57,450
they really do a lot of kind of, it's
kind of like self tracking, right?

1214
01:04:57,451 --> 01:05:01,710
And so every month a Bungee, your
check comes out to a, you know,

1215
01:05:01,711 --> 01:05:03,930
like we would pay taxes, right?
Bunch of mine comes another check,

1216
01:05:03,931 --> 01:05:05,760
but so they can spend it.
This is fascinating.

1217
01:05:05,761 --> 01:05:08,700
They spend their money on three things.
It goes, it goes in it, it's fun, right?

1218
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,900
Education, healthcare and housing. Okay.

1219
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:17,410
And so if you want cheaper, if any one
of those, if you want the cheapest of it,

1220
01:05:17,411 --> 01:05:21,550
right. It's very government subsidized
and it comes out of your fund, right?

1221
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:23,170
So only a little bit of mine comes out.

1222
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:27,220
If you want the nicest healthcare
or the nicest housing are nice,

1223
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:31,060
then it's only a tiny percent
government subsidized. Right?

1224
01:05:31,061 --> 01:05:33,010
So the more expensive the stuff gets,

1225
01:05:33,011 --> 01:05:36,790
whether it's education or housing or
healthcare, the less subsidize it gets in,

1226
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:40,630
the cheaper gets, the more subsidized it
gets. And so everyone Kinda, you know,

1227
01:05:40,631 --> 01:05:40,991
they pay,

1228
01:05:40,991 --> 01:05:45,820
they painted this fun so everyone has
this personal fund that they can use and

1229
01:05:45,821 --> 01:05:48,970
then you know, into those three things.
And so I think a lot of people have,

1230
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:52,500
I think they feel like they
have more control over their
lives and, and you know,

1231
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:54,640
obviously it is very strict
regulations and laws,

1232
01:05:54,641 --> 01:05:57,220
but from what I've seen and
I've spent a lot of time there,

1233
01:05:57,221 --> 01:05:59,440
everyone seems pretty happy.
That's interest.

1234
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,360
Yeah. That's an interesting
way to go. I mean,

1235
01:06:01,361 --> 01:06:04,940
I don't think there's any one good way
to government to govern people. Yeah.

1236
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:07,330
And I mean I think we have a
pretty good system over here,

1237
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:11,430
but it's obviously filled
with bureaucratic bullshit
and right. Too much weight,

1238
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:12,630
too much government.
There's much,

1239
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:16,390
there's way too many people doing stupid
jobs getting paid too much or doing

1240
01:06:16,391 --> 01:06:20,560
them. And I mean it's, and
then the shit like, you know,

1241
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:25,090
trying to chase down medical marijuana
in 2017 trying to stop legal marijuana

1242
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:28,330
and like why? Like what, who's
paying you to do this? Like why you,

1243
01:06:28,331 --> 01:06:29,830
why are you doing that?
That doesn't make any sense.

1244
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:31,710
It's not what our tax dollars
should be going towards.

1245
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:34,690
You know, it's funny when you go
all the way back, I think about it.

1246
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:38,260
So we talk about that process of who's
keeping them from doing this and you have

1247
01:06:38,261 --> 01:06:41,140
like the pharmaceuticals with,
with weed, which I think is true.

1248
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:45,850
You know what a funny one I think about
is John Mccain and mixed martial arts

1249
01:06:46,450 --> 01:06:47,920
who was sponsoring John Mccain,

1250
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:51,750
Budweiser who was like the
main advertisers of her boxing.

1251
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:55,240
It's like you cannot make an argument
that boxing safe for them and May,

1252
01:06:55,241 --> 01:06:59,290
you can't freaking do it. So like
it's impossible. It's impossible.

1253
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:04,590
But John Mccain's over here getting paid
by Budweiser and saying MMA is awful.

1254
01:07:04,631 --> 01:07:07,120
Let's ban it.
And the same time he's promoting boxing,

1255
01:07:07,121 --> 01:07:09,390
essentially it's fricking mindblowing.
Well in his

1256
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:13,330
fence. It was MMA from a long
time ago and it wasn't, yeah,

1257
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,230
it wasn't really the same as them may now.

1258
01:07:15,290 --> 01:07:17,810
And he's turned the corner and
now he supports him. My man. Yeah.

1259
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:22,020
But also you've got Budweiser and
bud light or sponsors now of MMA,

1260
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:26,030
so it's like, but that's a real problem
with politicians. They're dirty.

1261
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:28,860
There's so many dirty politicians.
I don't know what percentage is,

1262
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:32,160
but it's high 97. It's probably,
it's probably a fucking high.

1263
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:37,080
Know what crazy shit that, what could
crazy conspiracy do you believe in?

1264
01:07:37,790 --> 01:07:41,930
So the one that got me started really
like independently think myself was nine

1265
01:07:41,931 --> 01:07:46,360
11, which I think that was, that was
for a lot of people. Yeah. Yeah. What,

1266
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,730
what do you think about nine 11. Oh,
I know. I don't know all the answers,

1267
01:07:49,731 --> 01:07:54,650
but I know the given explanation. I
don't believe what, give an explanation.

1268
01:07:54,890 --> 01:07:57,410
Uh, the one that came, what's
the damn report that they wrote?

1269
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:02,720
The NIST report? No, that wasn't what
it was. Was it? Yeah, we'll, NIST is a,

1270
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:07,380
the one who did the report on,
um, tower seven collapsing.

1271
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:11,290
Now, what was the other report that
came out with right away? Um, anyway,

1272
01:08:11,291 --> 01:08:14,560
so I had my buddy that right by the
airport and he played loose change for me

1273
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:19,690
and I said, you are out of your Gd
Mind, like you are insane man. Right?

1274
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,630
And then I started thinking,
well that doesn't, maybe, maybe,

1275
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:27,110
maybe I should think about it. You
know, that it was an inside job.

1276
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:31,220
I'm not totally, I mean, I,

1277
01:08:31,221 --> 01:08:34,200
so I think obviously the planes
flew into the buildings for sure.

1278
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:37,430
If there's no doubt about
that. But um, that maybe the,

1279
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:41,660
there was inklings inclinations that ha
that was going to happen and that not

1280
01:08:41,661 --> 01:08:42,770
enough was done to stop it.

1281
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:45,830
I think, um, this is one,

1282
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:49,190
this is another thing where you have
a gigantic tragedy and because of a

1283
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:50,060
gigantic tragedy,

1284
01:08:50,061 --> 01:08:54,800
there's a lot of people that draw these
conclusions based on witness a testimony

1285
01:08:54,801 --> 01:08:55,670
and things that are happening.

1286
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:59,550
But I think you have to realize
that any time there's some,

1287
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,040
some thing that happens,

1288
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:05,600
people start looking for all these
different correlating factors, right?

1289
01:09:05,601 --> 01:09:08,240
You start saying, well, hey
look, you know, there was a,

1290
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:12,840
there's local tests that were being done.
There was, they were looking out for, uh,

1291
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:15,130
planes that were potentially
gonna fly into building.

1292
01:09:15,131 --> 01:09:16,700
Like they knew this was
going to happen in advance,

1293
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:21,490
but if you talk to anybody that
is in intelligence, there's,

1294
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:26,420
they're dealing with that shit every day.
Just one day something happens.

1295
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:29,750
There's always warnings
about terrorist attacks.

1296
01:09:29,751 --> 01:09:32,930
There's always warnings about things
happen. And a lot of times they,

1297
01:09:32,931 --> 01:09:36,020
these warnings get towards
like the FBI stop that. Um,

1298
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,280
wait, there was one, there was
one in San Francisco, right?

1299
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:41,290
They had bombs and they stopped in
the ledger, security, whatever. Yeah.

1300
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:45,480
And this has happened many times.
Yeah. Now when, when it doesn't,

1301
01:09:45,630 --> 01:09:49,860
when they don't catch it and it goes
through, then people start thinking, oh,

1302
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:51,450
there was some sort of a conspiracy.

1303
01:09:51,451 --> 01:09:55,890
They allow these planes
to fly into buildings. The
missile hit the Pentagon and

1304
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:59,080
look, there was a video came
out of that last week, but I,

1305
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:01,280
I might've been fake news,
the Pentagon thing.

1306
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:03,680
There was a video of the Pentagon
or something. He ended up Pentagon,

1307
01:10:03,681 --> 01:10:06,700
which looks like a missile and not an
airplane, but I don't believe it was,

1308
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:08,540
you know,
I was like this instincts,

1309
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:11,750
I've never seen this video before and
obviously there's no video evidence of

1310
01:10:11,751 --> 01:10:13,280
what hit the Pentagon.

1311
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,910
There's a video of something.
I know there was one, yeah,

1312
01:10:16,911 --> 01:10:20,150
the camera thing or a security
camera video that was released,

1313
01:10:20,151 --> 01:10:24,680
but what they did have is all sorts of
pizza pieces of aircraft all over the

1314
01:10:24,681 --> 01:10:29,681
fucking lawn in a blown up building
and a plane that's missing and all the

1315
01:10:29,691 --> 01:10:33,720
people dead. Like, I'm going to guess
it was a plane. Yeah. You know, I just,

1316
01:10:33,721 --> 01:10:36,950
I think people look for conspiracies
and everything cause it's exciting.

1317
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:42,250
Well, I mean stimulating about it.
There is, but then obviously be, I,

1318
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:46,290
I know that you don't believe
that everything we're told
is the truth right away.

1319
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:50,420
Right? I mean if we go to something like
a Gulf of Tonkin incident, right? I mean,

1320
01:10:50,610 --> 01:10:54,240
perfect. That's been proven to be false.
Or the fact like the banana republics,

1321
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:54,511
right?

1322
01:10:54,511 --> 01:10:58,320
Where Dole asked us to go take out one
of their dictators because they were

1323
01:10:58,321 --> 01:11:00,820
going to nationalize all of the
banana plants and that country. Yeah.

1324
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:05,400
I mean those things have been now proven
to be totally factual that the United

1325
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,190
States government went and did that
stuff. So the fact that, and you know,

1326
01:11:08,191 --> 01:11:12,960
in 1960s or seventies those things
were reported the opposite, right.

1327
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:14,010
We can't obviously take

1328
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,960
everything that we've
been reported as truth.

1329
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:21,290
While there's definitely been conspiracies
that have been put together and

1330
01:11:21,631 --> 01:11:26,430
executed and these conspiracies have
greatly affected the American people.

1331
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:28,620
The Gulf of Tonkin is a perfect example.

1332
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:33,090
Another one that they were planning on
was the operation Northwoods operation.

1333
01:11:33,091 --> 01:11:36,760
Northwoods was one that they were
planning on blowing up a drone jetliner

1334
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:40,020
blaming it on the Cubans that were going
to arm Cuban friendlies and have them

1335
01:11:40,021 --> 01:11:41,170
attack Guantanamo Bay.

1336
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:44,850
And they were gonna sacrifice American
troops and American lives and they were

1337
01:11:44,851 --> 01:11:48,810
going to do this in order to get people
to be excited about a war with Cuba. Yes.

1338
01:11:48,811 --> 01:11:51,600
Was, this is a real thing that was
signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

1339
01:11:51,601 --> 01:11:55,020
It was released by the
freedom of Information Act
and it was vetoed by Kennedy.

1340
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:56,910
So we know that there were people,

1341
01:11:56,911 --> 01:12:00,500
at least in 1962 they were
planning on shit like this. Yeah.

1342
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:01,530
So that's a real thing.

1343
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:05,250
And the idea that that just went away
and no one does that anymore. It's crazy.

1344
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,260
I don't, I don't believe
that. I think there's,

1345
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:12,290
there's most certainly evil people
in all fucking sectors of life.

1346
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:15,810
Yes, absolutely. Yeah. So it's
good to have an open mind,

1347
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:20,130
but there's also a lot of
fucking conspiracy loons
it looks they get consumed

1348
01:12:20,131 --> 01:12:22,590
good. That's, that's the
issue they get consumed with.

1349
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,050
Nothing that I've been told is true,

1350
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:27,770
which is obviously I said that
one far end of the spectrum and I,

1351
01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:30,150
anyone who is dead end is crazy also.
Yeah.

1352
01:12:30,151 --> 01:12:33,660
There's people out there that think the
satellites are fake and they think that

1353
01:12:34,990 --> 01:12:37,290
real and that the earth is flat is once.

1354
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:40,110
Why I just shake my head like the
moon landing one's my favorite.

1355
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:43,710
I got balls deep in that for
years I was complete complicit.

1356
01:12:43,710 --> 01:12:46,050
You think they did not go to the moon?
No, I don't. I don't think that anymore.

1357
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:48,750
But you know what I think now I think,
I don't know.

1358
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:54,510
But I do think that it is one of the more
fascinating conspiracies that between

1359
01:12:54,511 --> 01:12:58,120
1969 in 1972 they had seven,
seven,

1360
01:12:58,350 --> 01:13:00,960
seven to attempt six of them successful.

1361
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:04,850
But they went to the Apollo 13 was the
one that they didn't apparently make it

1362
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:05,940
and they had to come back.

1363
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:11,010
But that was the only time in history
that a human being has been more than 400

1364
01:13:11,011 --> 01:13:14,610
miles above the earth's surface.
All the space station missions,

1365
01:13:14,611 --> 01:13:18,690
all the space shuttle missions, all
that stuff is, is within Arbonne. Yeah,

1366
01:13:18,691 --> 01:13:20,580
it's low.
That's all very low.

1367
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:24,090
They went 260,000 miles out
and back into deep space,

1368
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:28,200
but they'd never even flown a chicken
out there and see if it can live.

1369
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:31,560
Like we really, really? Yeah. No, I'm
not into this. The space travel and so,

1370
01:13:31,561 --> 01:13:34,650
and they did a couple of flybys
went around the moon. Oh,

1371
01:13:34,651 --> 01:13:37,140
early before they landed on the
moon. Yeah. But other than that,

1372
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:41,430
I mean without unmanned drones, like what
we have on Mars and things like that,

1373
01:13:41,431 --> 01:13:45,330
we've never really sent a living
thing out through the magneto sphere,

1374
01:13:45,331 --> 01:13:49,140
through the van Allen radiation belts
into deep space, have it, you know,

1375
01:13:49,141 --> 01:13:52,700
I mean there's all these possibilities
of solar flares and anything that would

1376
01:13:52,701 --> 01:13:56,190
have killed him instantly and they just
did that and then we haven't been able

1377
01:13:56,191 --> 01:13:58,980
to do that since 1972
that's the one way I,

1378
01:13:58,981 --> 01:14:01,980
I've never looked into that moonlighting.
I think it's kind of Goofy, right?

1379
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:05,580
Well it's, it's weird. It's a weird
one. Why have we never gone back?

1380
01:14:05,581 --> 01:14:06,151
It's been fifth.

1381
01:14:06,151 --> 01:14:09,870
Surely our technology is far superior
to what it was in 1969 right?

1382
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:14,900
The technology is far superior except
that they're not using that technology for

1383
01:14:15,491 --> 01:14:19,630
man space, travel into deep space
like that and then go to the moon.

1384
01:14:19,631 --> 01:14:23,710
So it's like our technology and
all these other areas is superior,

1385
01:14:23,711 --> 01:14:26,830
but they haven't really worked towards
that because they haven't been funded.

1386
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:30,880
So the big issue is in many
ways it's money, right?

1387
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:33,460
There's how much money is
there and going to the moon,

1388
01:14:33,461 --> 01:14:36,580
and it's also very risky
to send humans out there.

1389
01:14:36,730 --> 01:14:39,520
Maybe we're talking about
manned missions to Mars now,

1390
01:14:39,521 --> 01:14:42,520
which may or may not take place by
2030 they're talking about doing that,

1391
01:14:42,521 --> 01:14:46,450
but it's way cheaper and safer
to send robots out there.

1392
01:14:46,451 --> 01:14:50,500
Like why risk human lives. It's
very retro the moon. Right,

1393
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:53,680
and if it robots on
Mars. Yeah, the rovers,

1394
01:14:53,810 --> 01:14:57,520
rovers on Mars or most the, that's
the most interesting because they're,

1395
01:14:57,521 --> 01:15:01,150
they're sending these really
high resolution photos of
the surface of Mars and

1396
01:15:01,151 --> 01:15:04,330
they're running tests and checking
for biological life. It's really,

1397
01:15:04,331 --> 01:15:09,310
really interesting stuff. But between
69 and 72 when they did all this stuff,

1398
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:10,173
I mean there's,

1399
01:15:10,690 --> 01:15:15,190
the technology back then was nothing
compared to what they have now in terms of

1400
01:15:15,191 --> 01:15:19,660
calculations and computers and,
and it's also, there was a,

1401
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:23,170
there's unquestionably some stuff that,

1402
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:28,260
whether it was images or video
that was faked and I think really,

1403
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,730
yeah, I do. Like I said, I
never looked into this at all.

1404
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:34,390
Gemini 15 is the big one because
there's a photo of Michael Collins.

1405
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:39,720
It shows him in deep space and they use
it as a press release saying that he was

1406
01:15:39,761 --> 01:15:44,761
on a space walk when it was really an
image of him from a test run where there

1407
01:15:45,971 --> 01:15:49,450
was all this stuff in the background
and he was on his harness and they just

1408
01:15:49,451 --> 01:15:53,170
blacked out the background and tried
to sell it as him being in space save.

1409
01:15:53,210 --> 01:15:55,240
You find that my Michael Collins,
you,

1410
01:15:55,330 --> 01:15:58,270
I was looking at how much it cost to send
somebody to space though. It's insane.

1411
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:03,280
79 70 million for ash and [inaudible]
not to fly on a Russian shuttle.

1412
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:08,770
Those private guy's trying to sell
tickets to places that mean days.

1413
01:16:08,771 --> 01:16:12,370
I'll just try and do it Musk
obviously. But that space, that's just,

1414
01:16:12,371 --> 01:16:13,990
that's just low earth orbit.
That's,

1415
01:16:13,991 --> 01:16:16,990
that's still inside 400 miles
or trying to go anywhere? No.

1416
01:16:16,991 --> 01:16:20,740
Well they might in the future.
Branson. Well that's all same thing.

1417
01:16:20,741 --> 01:16:22,180
It's all the way through but,
but,

1418
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:26,590
but they are talking about future
visits to the moon and to Mars.

1419
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,320
But a lot of times I feel like
when they say that, you know,

1420
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:33,070
George Bush senior said that they were
going to go to the mute back to the moon

1421
01:16:33,071 --> 01:16:36,460
again and like fucking one was that
1990 or whenever the hell that was.

1422
01:16:36,870 --> 01:16:39,520
But people have always said,
we're going to go back to the moon,

1423
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:43,540
but we haven't been back since 1972
does that mean that we never went? No.

1424
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:47,800
But Dennis gets weird when you find out
that Wernher von Braun was a fucking

1425
01:16:47,801 --> 01:16:51,610
Nazi. Who? Wernher von Braun, the
guy who he was the head of NASA.

1426
01:16:51,611 --> 01:16:56,050
He was the guy who organized the the
moon landings and though he was the head

1427
01:16:56,051 --> 01:16:59,730
rocket guy, he was, he,

1428
01:16:59,770 --> 01:17:02,950
that guy was a legit Nazi
like he's wanted by the,

1429
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:05,650
the Simon Wiesenthal Center
said that he was alive today.

1430
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:08,050
They would prosecute him
for crimes against humanity.

1431
01:17:08,230 --> 01:17:13,230
They would hang the five slowest workers
every day in front of his Berlin rocket

1432
01:17:13,461 --> 01:17:17,330
factory. Oh yeah. No, 100% I
mean, that's what they did.

1433
01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:21,920
What they did was they took this
thing was called operation paperclip,

1434
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:25,190
where when we won World War II,

1435
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:29,510
they took all the top Nazi scientists
and they secretly brought him over to

1436
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:33,080
America and they did it on the down low
so that no one would think like, hey,

1437
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:38,081
why do we have a guy named Wernher von
Braun running the American space program

1438
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:42,740
was because the, the Nazi scientists
were insanely advanced. Hmm.

1439
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:44,330
So the question is like,
well,

1440
01:17:44,331 --> 01:17:47,840
were they really Nazis or were they
scientists that were under the boot of the

1441
01:17:47,841 --> 01:17:51,410
Nazi administration? I mean, well, I
don't know. I mean, I'm not around that,

1442
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:56,800
but I do know that these are the people
that were the head engineers and the

1443
01:17:57,111 --> 01:17:58,190
people that designed it,

1444
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:03,580
Wernher von Braun's himself was saying
how impossible it was just years before

1445
01:18:03,801 --> 01:18:07,640
they did the moon landing and years
before operation paperclip that it was

1446
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:10,430
impossible to go to the moon or how
ridiculously impossible would be.

1447
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:15,580
But technology advanced from then to
when 1969 happened to when they did it.

1448
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:19,040
I stopped saying that we never went to
the moon because I really don't know what

1449
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:22,580
the fuck I'm talking about. And that's,
that's a big part of the understanding.

1450
01:18:22,581 --> 01:18:24,590
These conspiracies is hard.
You have to,

1451
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:28,490
well you have to really know how
much do I know about rocketry?

1452
01:18:28,491 --> 01:18:31,680
How much do I know about
aerospace? Zero. Yeah.

1453
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:34,400
So if I'm running around
saying I don't, I, you know,

1454
01:18:34,401 --> 01:18:37,070
I don't believe people went to the moon.
What is it based on?

1455
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:38,840
It's based on mostly on ignorance,

1456
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:43,900
speculation and the exciting
excited feeling that comes
with trying to uncover a

1457
01:18:44,511 --> 01:18:45,344
conspiracy.

1458
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:46,640
Sure.
But a,

1459
01:18:46,650 --> 01:18:50,510
and I think you do have to be a little
bit discerning on what you hear and, and,

1460
01:18:50,511 --> 01:18:53,120
but it is frustrating and that's
where a lot of these conspiracy guys,

1461
01:18:53,130 --> 01:18:57,200
they think they know more than they
do because you have to come to the

1462
01:18:57,201 --> 01:19:00,470
realization that you're probably never
going to know the real answer with a lot

1463
01:19:00,471 --> 01:19:03,410
of these things realize, I mean some
of them come out many, many, many,

1464
01:19:03,411 --> 01:19:06,650
many years later we're talking about
like Gulf of Tonkin writer or operation

1465
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:09,380
Northwoods. Many years later
it comes out, but you know,

1466
01:19:09,381 --> 01:19:12,290
there's a good likelihood that
I'll never know the truth on stuff.

1467
01:19:12,291 --> 01:19:13,220
I had read a lot about,

1468
01:19:13,330 --> 01:19:16,300
I think with the moon landing, it's way
more likely that we went to the moon,

1469
01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:20,200
but that some of the footage is fake and
I think they probably did that because

1470
01:19:20,201 --> 01:19:22,700
it's incredibly difficult
to film things on the moon.

1471
01:19:22,701 --> 01:19:26,620
And I think they filmed some stuff in
test runs and then tried to pass that

1472
01:19:26,621 --> 01:19:29,410
stuff that I iPhone,
they didn't have it back then.

1473
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:33,220
They had these cameras that they
had in the center of their chest.

1474
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:36,550
I think they were been taking a Selfie
on the moon. They had the snapchat,

1475
01:19:36,551 --> 01:19:40,480
snapchat, you'd have to take your shoot
off then you would die. There was theirs.

1476
01:19:40,570 --> 01:19:42,940
Yeah. They didn't have a camera
that you could put in front of you.

1477
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:43,180
Well,

1478
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:45,680
maybe they have one of the clicker buttons
they could have with their big gloves

1479
01:19:45,681 --> 01:19:46,610
on and they, they, you know,

1480
01:19:46,611 --> 01:19:49,460
they put the thing out and then
click it and then boom, snapchat.

1481
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:50,353
Why fight in the moment?

1482
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:53,510
Well that's what they said. Well,
it was that they did it remotely.

1483
01:19:53,511 --> 01:19:57,380
That's how they captured the
video of the lunar module,

1484
01:19:57,381 --> 01:20:01,280
leaving the surface of the moon and
panned up and watched it go that they did

1485
01:20:01,281 --> 01:20:05,540
all that remotely. Hmm. It's all
this some squirrely footage ever.

1486
01:20:05,541 --> 01:20:07,260
See the video of them
jumping around and it like,

1487
01:20:07,261 --> 01:20:09,490
they're on trampoline
and I see that we like,

1488
01:20:09,491 --> 01:20:11,820
they're just bouncing straight up
in the air and you're like, well,

1489
01:20:11,821 --> 01:20:15,840
what the fuck is that? How
come the physics are different
in different flights?

1490
01:20:15,841 --> 01:20:16,620
Like in some,

1491
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:19,890
some of the flights like Apollo 11
they're barely getting off the ground.

1492
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:24,150
They're walking, but they're kind
of to do. Yeah. Like that. Well,

1493
01:20:24,151 --> 01:20:27,420
there's ones like that and then there's,
we'll also ones where they fall down.

1494
01:20:27,421 --> 01:20:30,020
It looks like the getting
yanked up by wires. Hmm.

1495
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:34,110
I think it's entirely possible that some
of that stuff was fake. Huh. But I don't,

1496
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:37,200
I think it's way more likely that they
actually went to the moon than they

1497
01:20:37,201 --> 01:20:41,670
didn't. But it's way sexier to think that
they faked the whole thing. It's fun.

1498
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:45,090
It's fun to think they faked the whole
thing and everybody was quiet about it.

1499
01:20:45,091 --> 01:20:45,751
And you know,

1500
01:20:45,751 --> 01:20:49,860
Neil Armstrong gave this real cryptic
speech on the 25th anniversary of the Moon

1501
01:20:49,861 --> 01:20:54,600
mission saying that, you
know, there are hidden truths,
uh, the, the, the, that, uh,

1502
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:58,320
what is, what is the exact
quote that he said? Um,

1503
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:04,950
some of the great truths
that could be real revealed,

1504
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:10,200
removing some of truths, hidden
layers, like he was giving her away.

1505
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:14,370
It was real cryptic. It was like,
what do you see if he could find it?

1506
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:18,060
I got the video, the play, the video.
He might have been given it away. Well,

1507
01:21:18,061 --> 01:21:20,190
it seemed if you were conspiracy theory,

1508
01:21:20,191 --> 01:21:23,760
this would give you a rock hard
boner cause lesson. Listen to this.

1509
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:27,610
Armstrong, middle rare public
appearance. Next generation of taxpayers.

1510
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:31,060
No, no, no. Just play the whole thing
so you don't confuse everybody. Okay.

1511
01:21:31,540 --> 01:21:32,640
In 1994,

1512
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:37,680
Neil Armstrong meter rare public
appearance and held back tears as he spoke

1513
01:21:37,681 --> 01:21:42,270
these brief cryptic remarks before the
next generation of tax payers as they

1514
01:21:42,271 --> 01:21:43,350
toured the White House.

1515
01:21:44,990 --> 01:21:48,790
Today we have with us,
my group of the students,

1516
01:21:48,810 --> 01:21:52,610
some on America's best
to you.

1517
01:21:52,611 --> 01:21:56,330
We say we have only completed a beginning.

1518
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:01,420
We leave you much.
That is undone.

1519
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:04,610
There are great ideas.

1520
01:22:04,611 --> 01:22:09,611
Undiscovered breakthroughs are available
to those who can remove one of truths,

1521
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:14,030
protective layers.

1522
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:20,390
What the fuck does that mean? I
mean, what do you supposed to say Yo,

1523
01:22:20,391 --> 01:22:25,280
I went to the moon bitch. Yeah,
that's what's to say breakthroughs.

1524
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:26,960
He's giving it away.
Truth,

1525
01:22:26,961 --> 01:22:29,570
protective layers like I don't
even understand what that means.

1526
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:32,870
The vig caught the press conferences.
One of the more fascinating things,

1527
01:22:32,871 --> 01:22:34,460
if you watch the press conference again,

1528
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:36,890
I was balls deep in this stuff for years.

1529
01:22:37,310 --> 01:22:41,450
The press conference from 1969 when they
were returned from the moon is one of

1530
01:22:41,451 --> 01:22:44,420
the most cryptic weird
things you'll ever see.

1531
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:49,010
These guys look like they just stole
something and they're being questioned.

1532
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,420
It's, it's, it's,

1533
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:54,860
I've never seen a video where people
look like they're more full of shit.

1534
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:59,870
Then that video of the press conference
from 1969 it's weird, man. It's weird.

1535
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,150
They're like fidgety and looking nervous,

1536
01:23:02,151 --> 01:23:05,590
like they getting away with something
and then they might have done it right.

1537
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:10,720
They might have a been forced to say
some things that they didn't want to say

1538
01:23:10,721 --> 01:23:13,450
and that could be part of it.
Yeah, absolutely. You know,
they could have done it,

1539
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:17,260
but there's a lot of weirdness
with the moon landing. It's, it's,

1540
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:21,700
if you wanted to have like a conspiracy
that to wrap your head around,

1541
01:23:21,701 --> 01:23:26,170
it's exciting. It's one of the best
ones who benefit, who benefits from it?

1542
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:29,590
The United States government did because
it showed military superiority over the

1543
01:23:29,591 --> 01:23:32,560
Russians and we were able to
do that. It also, you know,

1544
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:36,670
it was the Nixon administration people
would just flat out full of Shit.

1545
01:23:36,730 --> 01:23:39,370
Well I mean they were just lying
to people left and right back then.

1546
01:23:39,410 --> 01:23:42,610
The government though. Yeah, but even
more so than cause it was unchecked.

1547
01:23:42,611 --> 01:23:43,720
There was no media,

1548
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:48,520
there's nothing that would expose
them for this and this stuff.

1549
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:53,560
They would air it on TV once in 1969 you
never see it again unless you watched

1550
01:23:53,561 --> 01:23:55,240
it on film.
There was no youtube.

1551
01:23:55,241 --> 01:23:58,900
We can go back and watch the
astronauts on trampolines video.

1552
01:23:59,170 --> 01:24:00,910
That's my favorite one.
You watch that and you'll,

1553
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:02,500
what in the fuck is happening there?

1554
01:24:02,501 --> 01:24:05,470
These guys are bouncing up in the
air like how are they doing that?

1555
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:09,910
Like they never did watch Apollo 11 when
they were moving around on the surface

1556
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:10,510
of the moon.

1557
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:14,440
It just like they're moving in slow
motion and then you go to whatever it was

1558
01:24:14,441 --> 01:24:17,950
like Apollo 14 or 15 when they
were doing the trampoline thing.

1559
01:24:17,951 --> 01:24:20,710
They fucking flying through the air.
Have you seen it?

1560
01:24:20,810 --> 01:24:23,190
I've not. I know I had never
gotten to the moon thing.

1561
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,520
The flatter watching is ridiculous.
This

1562
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:29,410
and like their feet are hidden.
Look at this,

1563
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:31,270
watch these guys bounce up in the air.

1564
01:24:31,271 --> 01:24:35,080
It's like they're on some sort of wireless
being yanked up into the air. Oh yeah.

1565
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:37,180
Like what the fuck are they doing?

1566
01:24:37,181 --> 01:24:41,350
And they're playing like falling
down and it's very weird.

1567
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:44,320
But it could have been that they were
really on the moon and these guys were

1568
01:24:44,321 --> 01:24:48,430
fucking cowboys and Yahoos and
they wanted to bounce around.

1569
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,150
Oh, you're a pussy. You're
posting those videos.

1570
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:52,770
Posted those videos back in the day.
Yeah.

1571
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:56,840
I had a debate on Penn
Jillette's radio show with uh,

1572
01:24:56,910 --> 01:25:00,880
a guy who was an astronomer and he
wasn't willing to admit a lot of stuff.

1573
01:25:00,881 --> 01:25:03,770
That was a fact, like the fact
that Wernher von Braun was a Nazi,

1574
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:07,180
the flag looks I was still there.
Well the flag out of wire,

1575
01:25:07,181 --> 01:25:10,970
first of all on the top of it that
stiffened it up to make it, but there was,

1576
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:15,340
there's videos of the flag
moving in a nonexistent breeze,

1577
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:17,100
which is weird too.
And yes,

1578
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:21,730
they try to make some logical explanations
for why the flag could be moving in a

1579
01:25:21,731 --> 01:25:26,530
vacuum and some of it makes sense,
but some of it doesn't like the,

1580
01:25:26,531 --> 01:25:29,500
the wires. One is weird. If
you watched them fall down,

1581
01:25:29,501 --> 01:25:33,670
like go to that one right there,
Jamie. You like if you watch,

1582
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:37,120
like sometimes they're falling down and
when they're falling down it looks like

1583
01:25:37,121 --> 01:25:41,710
they get yanked back up. But I think
it might not have been real footage.

1584
01:25:41,711 --> 01:25:46,270
What they might've done is use some test
footage like right there at Jamie right

1585
01:25:46,271 --> 01:25:47,104
there.
Let it go.

1586
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:50,800
Like homeboy falls down and then
it looks like he is yanked back up.

1587
01:25:50,801 --> 01:25:51,220
Look at this.

1588
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:54,190
Oh, he did not that him
standing up. Yeah. What is this?

1589
01:25:54,430 --> 01:25:56,760
That's not even standing up. You
can't stand up like that. Right,

1590
01:25:56,761 --> 01:26:00,370
but you're on the moon. You realize
you're on one six earth's gravity,

1591
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:04,040
but there was no, there was
nothing to make him go like
this. Right. You can't get

1592
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:04,903
up put.
Exactly.

1593
01:26:05,150 --> 01:26:09,230
Now we go back to MMA because that's what
these freaking folkstyle wrestling is.

1594
01:26:09,231 --> 01:26:13,040
The next generation of MMA,
you turn to your base to get up.

1595
01:26:13,310 --> 01:26:15,140
You can't look at it.
There's nothing on the ground.

1596
01:26:15,141 --> 01:26:18,920
How's he going to get the momentum of
the yanked up? He would have super abs.

1597
01:26:19,070 --> 01:26:22,460
He would have to be like a break dancer
because, okay, maybe a break dancer,

1598
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:26,750
maybe a break dancer, but you can't get
up without putting a base down. Right.

1599
01:26:27,450 --> 01:26:30,280
Yeah. That was really weird. I never,
I never saw hard watch it again.

1600
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:35,120
Watch him get yanked up. Yeah. He's
got no base pieces played in reverse.

1601
01:26:35,610 --> 01:26:39,800
Almost does it almost does that.
He couldn't stand up like that.

1602
01:26:39,801 --> 01:26:42,370
But the thing falls down right
afterwards so it wasn't reversed.

1603
01:26:42,890 --> 01:26:47,060
I think it's entirely possible that
some of the footage was bullshit,

1604
01:26:47,390 --> 01:26:49,100
but it doesn't mean that
they didn't go to the moon.

1605
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:53,720
It means it overzealous people in. He only
has one sweat on the ground there too.

1606
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,610
Right? Yeah. Well that's
true. Look at this watch.

1607
01:26:55,611 --> 01:26:59,540
So he stood up like that's ridiculous. You
can't do it. What is right? Floods down.

1608
01:26:59,541 --> 01:27:03,500
His left, what's up and he just goes
straight up the air. That's fake.

1609
01:27:03,830 --> 01:27:08,510
But I've never been in one six earth's
gravity and neither of you fake dude

1610
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:14,870
that that says we never went to the moon.
I saw that video is fake.

1611
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:17,150
Not to put the video is real.
That's from television.

1612
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:21,890
The video that guy standing up
like that he got helps on that.

1613
01:27:22,290 --> 01:27:25,040
Can't stand up like that very well.
He could have been on wires.

1614
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:29,060
It could have been that they were using
that to simulate what it would be like.

1615
01:27:29,061 --> 01:27:32,240
Cause they definitely
filmed a lot of simulations.

1616
01:27:32,270 --> 01:27:34,880
They get a lot of that because they
wanted to prepare the astronauts.

1617
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:39,410
It's entirely possible that some of those
simulations gotten passed off as being

1618
01:27:39,411 --> 01:27:43,580
an actual video of them on the moon.
Sure. Yeah, fair enough. Or the fake,

1619
01:27:43,581 --> 01:27:48,380
the whole fucking thing. I wasn't there,
so I'm pretty used to it as a privilege.

1620
01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:52,970
I think folkstyle wrestling is the next,
that's the next genesis of MMA, right?

1621
01:27:52,971 --> 01:27:57,040
We go, what's next? Like that guy
standing up. People don't realize it.

1622
01:27:57,041 --> 01:27:58,500
If you watched the Lima Roy Fight,
it was,

1623
01:27:58,501 --> 01:28:02,150
it was incredibly frustrating
to watch for me, uh,

1624
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:07,570
because Lima was literally just laying
on his back and guard and guard is almost

1625
01:28:08,460 --> 01:28:13,330
nonexistent effective in MMA now. Unless
you're Brian or Tayga. Okay. There's,

1626
01:28:13,390 --> 01:28:17,690
there's a few guys, tiny amount, but I
think those, but those guys are like, you,

1627
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:21,050
like your wrestling is so
highly effective and MMA.

1628
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:23,990
Some people could say you can't get
by just with Breslin. Well, well, hey,

1629
01:28:23,991 --> 01:28:25,910
I don't just wrestle.
I'm a black belt.

1630
01:28:25,911 --> 01:28:30,620
In Jujitsu you use on a lot of
wrestling. Yeah, primarily. Yeah.

1631
01:28:30,621 --> 01:28:32,920
I mean it's not that
Brian Ortega can box too.

1632
01:28:32,921 --> 01:28:35,450
You can do a lot of other things to
strike. I mean, he's a good solid striker,

1633
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:38,450
but his guard is so dangerous.

1634
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:42,140
It's just another level of dangerous
as opposed to most MMA fighters,

1635
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:47,210
including Lima. Yeah. And so,
uh, you know, people actually
going back to their base,

1636
01:28:47,211 --> 01:28:49,940
right? Which has been, it's been
a no, no, forever. And it may,

1637
01:28:49,941 --> 01:28:52,190
you don't go back to your base
because you expose your back. Right.

1638
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:53,690
But then again,
you know,

1639
01:28:53,691 --> 01:28:56,900
what percentage of guys who are sitting
in guard actually get submissions from

1640
01:28:56,901 --> 01:28:59,810
the guard? No, the number's
really small. Really? Well.

1641
01:29:00,110 --> 01:29:02,190
So you're going to have to out now.

1642
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:06,120
Okay. Like this. So it's so fresh. And
so in the, in the, in the Lima fight,

1643
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:09,810
Roy wins the first two rounds. It's
competitive, but he wins pretty clearly.

1644
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:11,370
But the leg kicks her state.

1645
01:29:11,390 --> 01:29:13,560
I had never been kicked as
hard by anyone's Douglas Lema.

1646
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:17,410
He kicked me one time in the
leg. I freaking it and walk
right for a week. Really?

1647
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:21,270
Oh my God. He kicks so hard. He
kicks so hard, so hard. And so, um,

1648
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:25,530
third round there's this accumulation
of leg kicks and all sudden Roy's leg is

1649
01:29:25,531 --> 01:29:28,030
really EFT. Up from getting
kicked a handful of times. Right.

1650
01:29:28,031 --> 01:29:31,740
And he's doing that low calf.
Yes. Chicken, I'm kind of
all over. But the EEC Roy,

1651
01:29:31,741 --> 01:29:35,040
Roy start are tending to do this one
and you know, instead of checking it,

1652
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:38,330
so Lima starts taking
control of the fight. The,

1653
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:40,050
I think he wins the third
round in my opinion.

1654
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:44,670
Fourth Round in the beginning he like
kicks him once and Roy falls down and he

1655
01:29:44,671 --> 01:29:46,800
hops in a mountain, starts beating
him up. You're like, holy crap,

1656
01:29:46,801 --> 01:29:50,760
this fight might be over. And then so
Roy recovers, but then the fifth round,

1657
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:55,260
Roy goes out and shoots like a single
leg, double leg. Like immediate.

1658
01:29:55,261 --> 01:29:58,170
We're talking first 10 seconds.
Right.

1659
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:01,590
And going into that writing to take shit.
He might get finished this round.

1660
01:30:01,591 --> 01:30:04,180
I mean he, he can barely
walk, look at his leg. Right.

1661
01:30:04,740 --> 01:30:07,860
And so they make us take it
down 10 seconds into the round.

1662
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:11,610
He literally stayed in guard for four
minutes, 50 seconds. And you're like,

1663
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:14,870
at some point is he going to
try to get up? Cause he has to,

1664
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:17,140
if he gets up in the lands
weren't too more kicks it out,

1665
01:30:17,141 --> 01:30:19,890
getting taken down the fights
likely over. Wow. You know,

1666
01:30:19,891 --> 01:30:24,360
but he refuses to turn to his
base because this is anti Jujitsu.

1667
01:30:24,361 --> 01:30:27,420
You shouldn't turn to your base in
Jujitsu cause you're getting choked. Yeah.

1668
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:31,110
Fuck it Joe. At that point you're losing.
Right. What else are you going to do?

1669
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:32,780
Well,
he never made to sweep him.

1670
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:36,720
He never did try to submit them on the
fact butterfly sweeping a couple of times.

1671
01:30:36,990 --> 01:30:40,680
But so at this point, I mean
even if I thought it was
two, two rounds, two rounds,

1672
01:30:40,681 --> 01:30:44,250
right, right. He was in the fifth round.
He's got to try to get up at some point.

1673
01:30:44,251 --> 01:30:47,520
So that was the did it for Rory.
So he won.

1674
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:52,470
He won 49 46 on two
scorecards in 48 47 on one.

1675
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:55,110
So what it was three to one.
So then even more, right.

1676
01:30:55,290 --> 01:31:00,180
Even more reason to get up at right. If
you're losing by that much. Um, but yeah,

1677
01:31:00,181 --> 01:31:02,010
Lima refused to get up. So at
that point I'm think, well, hey,

1678
01:31:02,011 --> 01:31:05,580
maybe Lima thinks he won or something.
I Dunno.

1679
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:08,010
But yeah,
so a lot did you do to,

1680
01:31:08,011 --> 01:31:12,720
people are struggling with this fact that
in modern day MMA you're going to have

1681
01:31:12,721 --> 01:31:16,320
to try to get up because God is no
longer that affective and you just get

1682
01:31:16,321 --> 01:31:18,660
punched in the face over and over
and over again. And that's terrible.

1683
01:31:18,750 --> 01:31:22,200
What are your feelings on going to half
guard and like going for an underwriter?

1684
01:31:22,201 --> 01:31:26,730
Same side. And yeah, try it, but it's
not, you know, again, like as me as a,

1685
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:30,630
as a top guy, I would rather be
in half guard than full guard.

1686
01:31:30,631 --> 01:31:33,390
I'm going to land a lot of damage
from half guard. And then you're also,

1687
01:31:33,391 --> 01:31:34,320
if you're in half guard,

1688
01:31:34,321 --> 01:31:37,530
you're me trying to work in your ESL tired
and you're very unlikely to sweep me.

1689
01:31:37,670 --> 01:31:41,340
Right. So I think half guard is
better than full guard. But I think,

1690
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:44,220
I think eventually where people are going
to have to get to is they're going to

1691
01:31:44,221 --> 01:31:45,090
have to actually get up.

1692
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:48,360
You're gonna have to get up and putting
your feet on someone's hips and kicking

1693
01:31:48,361 --> 01:31:51,900
them is no longer a great solution.
It works every once in a while,

1694
01:31:51,901 --> 01:31:54,390
but it's not like you can do that
every single time. It just does.

1695
01:31:54,391 --> 01:31:58,020
It's pretty rare. Pretty rare. So he
rarely, everybody's so aware of it. Yeah.

1696
01:31:58,021 --> 01:32:00,070
So bottom bottom and folk style wrestling

1697
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:03,490
I think is the next genesis and MMA
where people are really going to have to

1698
01:32:03,491 --> 01:32:07,630
have a deep understanding because once
you do get taken down or once you get a

1699
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:09,250
takedown, um, and there's some, you know,

1700
01:32:09,251 --> 01:32:12,570
Yoel Romero was the perfect example and
he never did folkstyle wrestling and

1701
01:32:12,580 --> 01:32:15,310
American, right. He's a very,
very elite freestyle wrestler,

1702
01:32:15,311 --> 01:32:19,720
but he gets these takedowns and you can
only stay on top for like 15 seconds.

1703
01:32:19,810 --> 01:32:20,170
Right.

1704
01:32:20,170 --> 01:32:23,340
It's like you did all that work to get
the guy on the ground and they use let

1705
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:26,560
them back up. Like what was the point?
Right. What was the point of it?

1706
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:28,061
Well,
he's,

1707
01:32:28,061 --> 01:32:31,280
he smashes some guys in the ground like
Machida when he got him down on the

1708
01:32:31,281 --> 01:32:33,980
ground and some of them,
yeah, put them away. He's um,

1709
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:38,450
he's a freak athlete too.
It's hard to say, Hey,

1710
01:32:38,451 --> 01:32:41,630
do what he does because it's like
no one's built like that guy.

1711
01:32:41,631 --> 01:32:44,750
That guy's the weird, he has the weirdest
body I've ever seen. Really? Why?

1712
01:32:44,751 --> 01:32:49,520
Because he looks like he's 230 pounds
and he weighs one 85 when he weighs in.

1713
01:32:49,870 --> 01:32:52,820
It's like how the fuck is that one
85 I always look at him, I'm like,

1714
01:32:52,821 --> 01:32:54,440
I don't even understand it.
Like where's the weight

1715
01:32:54,510 --> 01:32:55,680
going?
And you would think he's,

1716
01:32:55,681 --> 01:32:58,380
well those guys did some PD is by looking
at them but then when you look at him

1717
01:32:58,710 --> 01:33:03,710
like he won a world title
in 98 99 somewhere in there.

1718
01:33:04,830 --> 01:33:09,170
He looks the same. It was the same at
age 18 or 19 that's four test out yet.

1719
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:11,760
What's it crazy? You know, it's
incredible because then you think like,

1720
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:16,860
well if he is on pds it had to be prior
to age 18 cause he looks the same.

1721
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:21,560
Well, what are your thoughts on like
Karolin cause you know the carets yeah,

1722
01:33:21,561 --> 01:33:26,450
but they used to call him to experiment.
Yeah. And his parents are tiny. You know,

1723
01:33:26,451 --> 01:33:27,920
his parents are like five, five, five,

1724
01:33:27,921 --> 01:33:32,640
seven and then he's six foot whatever
the fuck he is a guru of a man. Yeah.

1725
01:33:33,050 --> 01:33:36,470
And I always wondered like
one day in the future,

1726
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:39,320
whether it's five years from
now or 30 years from now,

1727
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:42,440
they're going to be
genetically manipulated people.

1728
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:45,770
You're right, he watched
ICARUS. Yeah, sure.

1729
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:50,690
Yeah. And that was fascinating.
And that pretty much just,

1730
01:33:50,810 --> 01:33:52,610
I mean cemented the Russian,

1731
01:33:52,611 --> 01:33:55,370
that anti-doping program or
they run every single person,

1732
01:33:55,371 --> 01:33:58,770
state sponsored doping program
where everybody forever.
Yeah. For everybody. Yeah.

1733
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:02,570
It's crazy. And it's like you had the
hint that they were likely cheating,

1734
01:34:02,571 --> 01:34:05,780
you know, but then as someone
who competed against them, man,

1735
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:10,130
that's a tough pill to swallow because
they wouldn't make you feel, I mean,

1736
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:13,670
now it's like, well shit, I guess I
should it be one way or the other.

1737
01:34:13,671 --> 01:34:18,560
But to know that you are a leg down and
like going into MMA now I it MMA I do,

1738
01:34:18,561 --> 01:34:20,200
everyone was cheating for sure.
Right.

1739
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:23,000
So I'm going to fight them whether they're
cheating or not. I like to pride days.

1740
01:34:23,001 --> 01:34:25,790
It was essentially sanction that was
sanctioned. Like they would tell him like,

1741
01:34:25,791 --> 01:34:29,060
hey, you know, when this contract
that says you can do steroids. Right.

1742
01:34:29,061 --> 01:34:31,640
And how does one IFC handle
that? Uh, so they don't,

1743
01:34:31,641 --> 01:34:35,180
they don't do drug testing yet?
Well, yeah, I mean I should be fine.

1744
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:39,510
I've been pushing them to do so, uh,
you know, in my time there and their,

1745
01:34:39,530 --> 01:34:42,890
their thing is that, um,
a lot of these countries,

1746
01:34:42,891 --> 01:34:46,630
it's not prevalent in Indonesia
or Manila or wherever.

1747
01:34:46,631 --> 01:34:49,760
And so I'll just skip to find out,
just get the fuck out of here with that.

1748
01:34:49,820 --> 01:34:51,130
That's my,
that's not my style.

1749
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:54,500
That's what he's saying that it's almost
Joe Rogan saying that. Get the fuck out.

1750
01:34:54,501 --> 01:34:58,460
So there, but there, I know you've saw,
you've, you've talked a couple times,

1751
01:34:58,460 --> 01:35:01,970
I've heard you about their way and program
and one of which I think is fantastic

1752
01:35:01,971 --> 01:35:06,950
and I think every, every MMA organization
should do it at the high level ones.

1753
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:09,140
Could you explain it? Yeah.
So it's really simple.

1754
01:35:09,141 --> 01:35:12,380
You do hydration and you do
wait, oh ski on scale, same time.

1755
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:16,250
So you can't cut water out. Right, right.
So to piss hydrated, get on the scale.

1756
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:18,950
Literally moments later, like you
go in the bathroom, you pissed,

1757
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:21,680
they test the specific gravity
you go get on the scale. Right?

1758
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:24,140
So essentially everyone
moved up one way class.

1759
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:26,510
Every one of their champions
bumped up a weight class.

1760
01:35:26,630 --> 01:35:28,940
So like over there I fight
one of the five. But you know,

1761
01:35:28,950 --> 01:35:32,930
it's essentially wealth or they even call
it welter weight because it's the same

1762
01:35:32,931 --> 01:35:36,380
thing because I can't cut any waterway.
They adjusted it. So they just,

1763
01:35:36,381 --> 01:35:37,300
they moved every day.

1764
01:35:37,350 --> 01:35:40,010
So I was the welterweight champion and is
still the way to welterweight champion.

1765
01:35:40,011 --> 01:35:42,700
They just move. The weight
class is different. Um,

1766
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:47,240
so there's the day of the fight. The day
before the fight. Cheers for the fight.

1767
01:35:47,390 --> 01:35:49,460
If you make the two days before the fight,

1768
01:35:49,461 --> 01:35:52,070
if you make both the
weight and the hydration,

1769
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:54,800
you do not have to wait test or
hydration test on the last day, you're,

1770
01:35:54,801 --> 01:35:58,460
you're clear. So if you make it both
those days, cause you're not going to be,

1771
01:35:58,461 --> 01:36:00,800
there's not going to fluctuate
and for 24 hours and listen,

1772
01:36:00,801 --> 01:36:02,270
if you can figure out how to cheat that,

1773
01:36:02,271 --> 01:36:04,500
I can't figure out how someone
could possibly cheat that test.

1774
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:06,170
Because when the first incident I said,

1775
01:36:06,171 --> 01:36:08,960
well how is someone going to cheat
on this? Or how could someone cheat?

1776
01:36:08,961 --> 01:36:12,590
You know what it's like they look
at, they watch a Piss, you know,

1777
01:36:12,591 --> 01:36:15,830
you can't have like a wizard or on
or anything. Right. Uh, so I don't,

1778
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:18,530
I don't know how you achieve. I don't
think you can. I don't think you can.

1779
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:20,330
I don't think you can.
So yeah.

1780
01:36:20,331 --> 01:36:23,570
So it's fantastic because like fight
week then instead of making this,

1781
01:36:23,571 --> 01:36:27,590
and so what I would fight one 70 I
would be one 83 to one 85 to start my

1782
01:36:27,591 --> 01:36:30,560
waterway cut out.
Cut The waterway to one 70 or one 71,

1783
01:36:30,561 --> 01:36:34,640
depending on title or non title,
and then I would hydrate back up.

1784
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:36,860
So now I don't have to do that.
That dehydration process,

1785
01:36:36,861 --> 01:36:41,420
I'm literally the exact same size
I was prior. And a, you know,

1786
01:36:41,421 --> 01:36:44,360
media obligations during week
are obviously a lot easier
because I'm not worried

1787
01:36:44,361 --> 01:36:47,530
about cutting my weight or I'm not
feeling miserable or whatever. Um,

1788
01:36:48,170 --> 01:36:50,870
and it's a lot safer.
And then so if someone misses,

1789
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:54,650
so mrs obviously they're fine.
The same as in America.

1790
01:36:54,650 --> 01:36:59,150
If you miss what you're fine. If
you miss hydration, uh, so say Joe,

1791
01:36:59,151 --> 01:37:02,030
you're wanting any five and you weighed
in when a five, but you're dehydrated,

1792
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:06,560
you didn't really make it right.
You have to get hydrated and make weight.

1793
01:37:06,770 --> 01:37:09,500
So if you miss, wait, if you miss it, so
it's the last day you haven't made it.

1794
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:12,020
You have to keep drinking
until you piss hydrated.

1795
01:37:12,021 --> 01:37:14,300
And then whatever you way
there is what you weigh.

1796
01:37:14,310 --> 01:37:18,590
So what's the parameters when it comes
to hydration or not hardware? It's the,

1797
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:20,730
it's the same skill that you use for it.
Uh,

1798
01:37:20,780 --> 01:37:23,810
in America at the beginning of the
college wrestling season or high school,

1799
01:37:24,050 --> 01:37:27,200
you have to do specific or every test,
I believe I might mess up a zero,

1800
01:37:27,201 --> 01:37:31,400
but I think it's 1.0 to five
is this specific area which
I know is the same they

1801
01:37:31,401 --> 01:37:32,070
use for hydrated,

1802
01:37:32,070 --> 01:37:35,780
not hydrated in wrestling in America to
anything under that you're dehydrated.

1803
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:39,770
No, you're good. So you want to be
bullet. So 1.0, zero, zero, zero is water.

1804
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:44,720
So you want to be close to that, right?
And so there is like you do have to just,

1805
01:37:44,750 --> 01:37:47,250
you have to drink some water, right?
If you drink a whole bunch of water,

1806
01:37:47,251 --> 01:37:50,090
you piss it out perfectly hydrated.
But if you know,

1807
01:37:50,510 --> 01:37:53,180
there have been a couple of times
like so in the early days they did,

1808
01:37:53,210 --> 01:37:54,260
they did tests.

1809
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:56,940
This is the first two days we're actually
just testing to see where you were at.

1810
01:37:57,270 --> 01:38:00,300
The third day was the one that
counted. You know, it's like if you,

1811
01:38:00,301 --> 01:38:02,340
if you ate a bunch of
like meat or something,

1812
01:38:02,341 --> 01:38:05,310
you might show up as dehydrated even
though that's what you walk around.

1813
01:38:05,311 --> 01:38:07,950
And every single day, so you'd have
to make sure you drink a lot of water.

1814
01:38:07,951 --> 01:38:09,360
So it's coming out nice and clear.

1815
01:38:09,740 --> 01:38:11,270
That's an interesting way of doing it.

1816
01:38:11,271 --> 01:38:13,820
And I think that's a great idea because
I think that is one of the biggest

1817
01:38:13,821 --> 01:38:18,020
problems in MMA. The Uriah hall and
Vitor Belfort got canceled last week.

1818
01:38:18,620 --> 01:38:22,730
Uriah hall was like literally having
seizures on his way to the way and crazy.

1819
01:38:22,731 --> 01:38:24,830
Right. It's fucking insane. It does.

1820
01:38:24,890 --> 01:38:29,150
And I think it's one of the worst parts
of MMA because I think MMA shouldn't be

1821
01:38:29,151 --> 01:38:34,151
about who's slickest in being
able to deceive the weight system.

1822
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:39,340
I mean it should be your skill versus
your opponent's skill. You both the same.

1823
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:39,991
Well,
the whole,

1824
01:38:39,991 --> 01:38:42,570
the whole point of it is the whole point
of the way it's to fight someone our

1825
01:38:42,571 --> 01:38:44,850
same size. Yes. That's the
whole point of it. Yes.

1826
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:48,780
And so why people would fight back
against those system that one fc is using

1827
01:38:48,781 --> 01:38:52,440
this beyond me because listen,
the most miserable part of my weight cut.

1828
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:54,630
I'm fine dieting and that's all good.
Right?

1829
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:58,560
But when you got to cut that last
12 1314 pounds of water weight out,

1830
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,380
it's miserable. Everybody
knows is miserable. Right.

1831
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:04,300
And it affects your performance
the next day. Yeah. I mean, so my,

1832
01:39:04,301 --> 01:39:06,570
my thought process was it affects
them more than it affects me.

1833
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:09,780
Maybe that's just me being positive
about it. Right. That was, why is that?

1834
01:39:09,781 --> 01:39:14,760
Because if you were wrestling pussy and
I'm not right. Or maybe it's just me,

1835
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:16,530
my me psyching myself up.

1836
01:39:16,650 --> 01:39:20,610
So my thought process on everything is
anything that goes wrong will affect my

1837
01:39:20,611 --> 01:39:24,180
opponent more than it will affect me.
Oh, that's a good way. I am more stable.

1838
01:39:24,181 --> 01:39:27,990
I can deal with shit that goes wrong.
Most people affects them.

1839
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:29,790
And so maybe that's just
me telling myself that,

1840
01:39:29,791 --> 01:39:31,360
but that makes me feel good about it.
Well,

1841
01:39:31,610 --> 01:39:32,870
people feel that way about awakening,

1842
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:35,540
the lightweight cutting because they
think that the other is not gonna be able

1843
01:39:35,541 --> 01:39:36,440
to handle it as well.

1844
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:39,420
Make them go through some adversity
and then the next day he's gonna be

1845
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:42,630
troubled. Sure. Exactly. So, but I
think if you take that process away,

1846
01:39:42,650 --> 01:39:47,330
I think it makes media obligations a lot
easier. It makes people a lot healthier.

1847
01:39:47,390 --> 01:39:50,500
And yeah, I mean, how many fights have
you, just from a business standpoint,

1848
01:39:50,510 --> 01:39:52,910
how many fights have we had canceled
this year because of the weight thing?

1849
01:39:52,911 --> 01:39:55,030
I mean,
quite a few.

1850
01:39:55,070 --> 01:39:57,520
Did it change your performance?
How physically, how do,

1851
01:39:57,560 --> 01:39:58,393
how would you feel the neck?

1852
01:39:58,610 --> 01:40:00,450
I, I think I felt, you
know, honestly for me,

1853
01:40:00,451 --> 01:40:02,800
I know they said those studies that
you don't really fully hydrate. I've,

1854
01:40:02,801 --> 01:40:07,050
I believe it was 36 to 48 hours after man.
I've always felt fine.

1855
01:40:07,051 --> 01:40:11,970
And so I, so when I graduated college, um,
the way class in the United States for,

1856
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:17,040
for the Olympics stuff was one 63 I would
weigh roughly one 75 on a day to day

1857
01:40:17,041 --> 01:40:20,100
basis and then water cut down to one 63.
Um,

1858
01:40:20,130 --> 01:40:23,910
and then when I was fighting at one 70,
I would say between one eight three,

1859
01:40:23,911 --> 01:40:28,590
one one eight, five and water cut down to
one 70. So my water weight cut was very,

1860
01:40:28,591 --> 01:40:32,810
very similar. Every single time. You know,
I was disciplined in that manner. I want,

1861
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:34,200
I didn't want to be fluctuating.

1862
01:40:34,201 --> 01:40:38,940
And so my goal is actually to get down
to my target weight six weeks prior to

1863
01:40:38,941 --> 01:40:42,570
competition, right? So I'm walking around
one, eight, three, two, one and e five,

1864
01:40:42,571 --> 01:40:45,630
six weeks prior. So I'm the same
exact person every single day.

1865
01:40:45,930 --> 01:40:48,300
Whereas I think the part that
a lot of these people f up,

1866
01:40:48,301 --> 01:40:49,950
and it's because they're
not disciplined enough,

1867
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:54,040
is they try to descend while they're
training, right? So, you know,

1868
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:56,920
maybe I get up to one 95,
which is, that's a small bump.

1869
01:40:56,921 --> 01:41:00,910
Some of these guys are really
undisciplined. They get way,
way, way, way overweight,

1870
01:41:00,911 --> 01:41:04,510
right? And so during that last six
weeks, or even the last couple weeks,

1871
01:41:04,511 --> 01:41:07,570
they're trying to bring that body
weight down, right? And so in my mind,

1872
01:41:07,571 --> 01:41:11,080
there's two ways to lose weight. You can
dye it and lose body weight, right? Fat,

1873
01:41:11,081 --> 01:41:12,770
mass, whatever. Um,

1874
01:41:12,910 --> 01:41:15,880
and then there's the waterway where we're
sweating and we're taking that out of

1875
01:41:15,881 --> 01:41:19,870
us, right? There's the two ways. And so
I think a lot of guys, and I, you know,

1876
01:41:19,871 --> 01:41:21,610
I don't know if you've ever
cut weight show, but I know.

1877
01:41:21,610 --> 01:41:25,960
So for me it was in college in the summers
I'd get really fat and then I'd bring

1878
01:41:25,961 --> 01:41:28,060
my weight down in the fall.
And you feel it when you're not,

1879
01:41:28,270 --> 01:41:29,950
when you're losing more
calories than you're taking in.

1880
01:41:29,951 --> 01:41:32,800
It's like this weird feeling in your
body and you feel like shit all the time.

1881
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:38,640
And so I think a lot of fighters are
doing that really close to when they're

1882
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:39,753
fighting.

1883
01:41:39,910 --> 01:41:42,970
And so now the waterway cut makes you
feel terrible and now they're cutting

1884
01:41:42,971 --> 01:41:46,180
everything out. Calorically also and
said that's like a double whammy.

1885
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:47,410
That's what I think about it.

1886
01:41:47,710 --> 01:41:52,450
There's another thing that benefits
wrestlers and the wrestlers seem to take

1887
01:41:52,451 --> 01:41:55,110
pride in being able to push
through discomfort. Yes.

1888
01:41:55,270 --> 01:41:57,220
And the more miserable you are,

1889
01:41:57,340 --> 01:42:00,940
the more you just fucking bite down
your mouthpiece and deal with it. Well,

1890
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:03,280
cause you, you get used to
doing that all through camps,

1891
01:42:03,281 --> 01:42:07,120
all through college and high school.
You're always dehydrated.

1892
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:08,140
You're always losing weight.

1893
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:08,601
Well,

1894
01:42:08,601 --> 01:42:11,930
I mean the cod dressing that is not that
the way cuttings not that bad anymore.

1895
01:42:11,931 --> 01:42:16,931
So they had the system and people are
starting to change a 97 I think couple

1896
01:42:17,361 --> 01:42:19,930
died and a change it. But
you know what? The name

1897
01:42:19,990 --> 01:42:22,080
institute the same thing as one of,
see that's sort of a,

1898
01:42:22,690 --> 01:42:25,370
so it's once you do it in the
beginning and find your minimum weight,

1899
01:42:25,610 --> 01:42:28,310
but I think more than anything what
people are, it's, it's a one our way in.

1900
01:42:28,550 --> 01:42:31,970
So you, so if you're dual me does at
one o'clock everybody weighs in at noon,

1901
01:42:32,030 --> 01:42:35,990
right? So what people have found out,
you can't cut, you can't cut weight.

1902
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:37,760
We wrestle like shit.
So

1903
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:39,420
problem with fighting doing that though

1904
01:42:39,490 --> 01:42:43,640
is brain injuries. So that's, I think once
you the best. But in college wrestling,

1905
01:42:43,641 --> 01:42:46,370
you're talking about the discomfort
thing. Part of that is that, you know,

1906
01:42:46,371 --> 01:42:49,470
when you go to a college wrestling
program, again, it's very structured.

1907
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:53,060
You can't skip, right? You have to be
there every single day. Right on time.

1908
01:42:53,420 --> 01:42:56,420
And then it's like you have
40 boy, you know, black belt,

1909
01:42:56,421 --> 01:42:57,640
right digit two black belts.
Well,

1910
01:42:57,690 --> 01:43:02,690
and not even just black
belts like worldclass 19 to
23 in their physical prime

1911
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:04,820
ready to fight each
other every single day.

1912
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:08,630
And so you get used to this grind
dealing with people, battling people,

1913
01:43:08,631 --> 01:43:11,720
discomfort every single day. Um, you know,

1914
01:43:11,721 --> 01:43:14,020
and a lot of is also dealing
with injuries like you know,

1915
01:43:14,030 --> 01:43:17,270
and chill son and talks about it a lot
that hey and I was talking to my casual

1916
01:43:17,271 --> 01:43:17,991
is less.
Listen,

1917
01:43:17,991 --> 01:43:22,300
the national tournament for the NCA is
March 15th through 17th and you cannot

1918
01:43:22,310 --> 01:43:24,200
guarantee me you're going to be
totally healthy on that date.

1919
01:43:24,230 --> 01:43:27,500
You cannot guarantee meet your
and be, uh, not sick on that date.

1920
01:43:27,530 --> 01:43:30,230
You're going to have to compete March
15th through March 17th no matter what if

1921
01:43:30,231 --> 01:43:32,030
you want to enrolled, you
know, a national title.

1922
01:43:32,330 --> 01:43:37,250
And so wrestlers get used to this grind
where you just don't see that in other

1923
01:43:37,251 --> 01:43:38,084
sports.

1924
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:38,781
Yeah.

1925
01:43:38,781 --> 01:43:43,700
I think that that aspect of wrestling is
one of the biggest tools that they take

1926
01:43:43,701 --> 01:43:48,320
into the octagon. The mental toughness and
that, that ability to, I mean the grind,

1927
01:43:48,980 --> 01:43:50,180
it's again, it's, it's a,

1928
01:43:50,181 --> 01:43:54,030
it's a badge of in wrestling to
be able to handle the grind. Yeah.

1929
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:57,320
It's not really in kickboxing
or in Moitai or any others.

1930
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:00,890
Well then not really forced to, I
mean how many, how many kickboxing or,

1931
01:44:00,891 --> 01:44:05,120
or Jujitsu schools you name where there's
literally 40 black belt. I mean it's,

1932
01:44:05,210 --> 01:44:07,010
it's been borne out through
high school wrestling.

1933
01:44:07,011 --> 01:44:08,750
You go to all these national
tournaments and stay terms,

1934
01:44:08,990 --> 01:44:11,180
you find out who the best are,
the best of the best,

1935
01:44:11,181 --> 01:44:15,290
get recruited and they go
to these institutions to
train with the other best of

1936
01:44:15,291 --> 01:44:19,100
the best of the best, you know. And then,
and then addition to that, the other,

1937
01:44:19,210 --> 01:44:22,460
the post-collegiate guys who are trying
to make the world teams and Olympic

1938
01:44:22,461 --> 01:44:23,680
teams,
they're sticking around training.

1939
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:27,320
So you have this like melting pot
of freaking really great wrestlers.

1940
01:44:27,321 --> 01:44:31,760
They're trained with each other every
single day for five to plus five years.

1941
01:44:31,761 --> 01:44:33,740
If you're going to world
championships, right? Yeah,

1942
01:44:33,890 --> 01:44:34,281
yeah.

1943
01:44:34,281 --> 01:44:38,900
There also seems to be like a much more
systematic approach to training people

1944
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:42,530
and a lot more drilling, you know, and
a lot of Jujitsu schools like gosh,

1945
01:44:42,531 --> 01:44:47,270
should the arm bar from the guard here.
We hooked the arm. Okay. I go on to here,

1946
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:51,380
my legs, I make my leg, I lift up. Okay.
You practice, everybody get together.

1947
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:53,970
It drives me insane.
It drives a few times.

1948
01:44:54,230 --> 01:44:57,860
Like I'll go to Jujitsu classes
sometimes and the literally go over to

1949
01:44:57,861 --> 01:44:58,551
techniques.

1950
01:44:58,551 --> 01:45:02,540
You drill it twice and then the last
rest of the class is just people rolling.

1951
01:45:02,630 --> 01:45:06,620
Five minutes. Yeah, five, five minute
goes. Maybe it drives me insane Joe,

1952
01:45:06,621 --> 01:45:09,980
because I come from this
wrestling background and
then I also like sports psych

1953
01:45:09,981 --> 01:45:13,880
in this study of high performance
is like, that's what I love. I love,

1954
01:45:13,881 --> 01:45:16,640
I love studying people who are the best
in their field at whatever they do.

1955
01:45:17,090 --> 01:45:19,700
And we know without a shadow of a doubt,

1956
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:22,610
just saying go for five minutes is not
the most effective way to train someone

1957
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:25,820
does not happen. So in wrestling there's
a whole bunch of different, you could do,

1958
01:45:25,821 --> 01:45:28,580
some days you might do matches,
some days you might do a 30 minute ago,

1959
01:45:28,581 --> 01:45:30,650
some days you might do a
group of three women, it goes,

1960
01:45:30,651 --> 01:45:33,590
some days you might do situations.
I started on the single leg,

1961
01:45:33,591 --> 01:45:35,270
I started a high crotch, I
sent a friend Doc. Right?

1962
01:45:35,271 --> 01:45:39,110
And so there's all these different
scenarios that we might try mean if I'm

1963
01:45:39,111 --> 01:45:41,540
coaching my academy right
and we're working on it, we,

1964
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:43,900
we drove front headlocks or
we called Mantis position,

1965
01:45:43,910 --> 01:45:48,340
we've grab both armpits and bounce and
go for Joel on that. We don't just say,

1966
01:45:48,341 --> 01:45:50,230
okay now go five minute
goes cause how many,

1967
01:45:50,231 --> 01:45:52,100
how many tries are they going
to get it going in the math,

1968
01:45:52,101 --> 01:45:54,820
this position there are the front
headlock, maybe one, maybe two.

1969
01:45:54,821 --> 01:45:58,120
But essentially most people if
you say go for five minutes, they,

1970
01:45:58,121 --> 01:46:01,000
they are not disciplined enough
to make themselves do new skills.

1971
01:46:01,001 --> 01:46:04,000
They revert to whatever they do best and
then he's doing over and over and over

1972
01:46:04,001 --> 01:46:07,870
and over again. Right. And so if I want
a kid to be good at a for a headlock,

1973
01:46:07,871 --> 01:46:10,780
which if you're going to wrestle at a high
level, you need a good for a headlock,

1974
01:46:10,810 --> 01:46:12,730
period, factual, you have to have it.

1975
01:46:13,090 --> 01:46:15,940
I'm going to put him in there
50 times in that practice.

1976
01:46:16,330 --> 01:46:19,410
He's going to get it over and over and
over and over and maybe the next day it's

1977
01:46:19,420 --> 01:46:22,390
single likes and then maybe next
day it's double legs, right?

1978
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:25,990
And then maybe Sundays you say, Hey, go
for 10 minutes, go wrestle. Right. Right.

1979
01:46:25,991 --> 01:46:27,180
Cause you want to change
it up on a little bit,

1980
01:46:27,850 --> 01:46:31,990
but saying go for five minutes every
single day is very much not the most

1981
01:46:31,991 --> 01:46:32,860
effective way to do it.

1982
01:46:33,100 --> 01:46:37,240
And it's so insanely frustrating
for me to have that happen.

1983
01:46:37,241 --> 01:46:39,100
And almost every Jujitsu
school on the planet,

1984
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:42,610
Eddie Bravo is talked about
this a lot. And one of the
things that he says, uh, um,

1985
01:46:42,910 --> 01:46:46,660
Jujitsu, so fun role that people just
want to get to the rowing part real quick.

1986
01:46:46,690 --> 01:46:50,230
I don't care what they want. It could
be wrong. Like I freaking Care Gel.

1987
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:54,720
I want them and my kids tell me all kinds
of stuff. I said I'm running practice.

1988
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:57,390
I went to the Olympics,
I want to hunch trophies.

1989
01:46:57,780 --> 01:47:00,320
You're at my school cause you want to
learn how to be the best dominant help.

1990
01:47:00,330 --> 01:47:03,450
You beat the best. Yeah. Yeah.
I don't care what you like.

1991
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:05,970
I don't care what you like. Some
days, every once in a while,

1992
01:47:05,971 --> 01:47:09,090
hey you guys don't play game wireless
play game right every once in a while just

1993
01:47:09,091 --> 01:47:11,970
to keep it fun. Just to keep
it fun. Right? Hey you want
to do this? Let's do that.

1994
01:47:12,030 --> 01:47:15,000
Every once in a while I'll indulge you.

1995
01:47:15,001 --> 01:47:19,800
But most of the time you're
here and so you know, we
don't, for our, for our young,

1996
01:47:19,830 --> 01:47:22,230
we don't really push our young
kids too hard, but like especially,

1997
01:47:22,231 --> 01:47:23,610
well I'll tell about high school guys.

1998
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:26,070
You're telling me you want
to be a state champion.

1999
01:47:26,070 --> 01:47:27,150
You're telling me you
want to go to college,

2000
01:47:27,151 --> 01:47:29,160
you're telling me all of
these things you wanted to,

2001
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:31,380
I know what it takes to get there.
I've been there myself,

2002
01:47:31,381 --> 01:47:35,040
I've seen many other people achieve
those things. And so, you know,

2003
01:47:35,041 --> 01:47:35,880
and there's a lot of,
you know,

2004
01:47:35,881 --> 01:47:39,300
it's really funny cause people choose and
this even go Emma May, we can get life.

2005
01:47:39,570 --> 01:47:42,150
People choose what they value. Right?
And I'll just give you a simple example.

2006
01:47:42,151 --> 01:47:44,400
I get this, I got this one kid who's
probably listening to the show right now,

2007
01:47:44,401 --> 01:47:47,810
cause I know he loves you. Uh,
what's his name? Oh I can't,

2008
01:47:48,110 --> 01:47:50,480
well I can't give one of my kids a
shout out and not all of them. So,

2009
01:47:51,090 --> 01:47:54,370
but he's probably kind of
who you are. He's got to know
who I'm talking about. He,

2010
01:47:54,510 --> 01:47:58,500
he goes freaking hard. Just
boom, grind, grind, grind.

2011
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:01,500
Just I couldn't, I couldn't ask
for a kid to work harder, Joe.

2012
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:03,840
But when I started teaching technique,

2013
01:48:03,870 --> 01:48:07,530
he tunes me out and then we go to the
national tournament and he places but he

2014
01:48:07,531 --> 01:48:10,590
gets, he gets scored on a
whole bunch by the technique.

2015
01:48:10,591 --> 01:48:13,020
We were just drilling and then I say,
hey bud,

2016
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:15,390
you just tuned me out
the last three weeks.

2017
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:17,730
We were just drilling that thing and
you just got your ass kicked by it.

2018
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:20,730
And so I love the fact
that you want to go hard,

2019
01:48:20,731 --> 01:48:24,070
but you need to also value
the technique, right? Yeah.

2020
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:26,700
And then there's some people who value
the technique too much and they all do.

2021
01:48:26,701 --> 01:48:28,650
I do this technique and then
when it comes to going hard,

2022
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:31,680
they don't go hard enough. Right.
Because in wrestling or in any,

2023
01:48:31,681 --> 01:48:33,480
in any venture you want to take in life,

2024
01:48:33,870 --> 01:48:35,370
there's not just one way to be successful.

2025
01:48:35,371 --> 01:48:38,640
You need a bunch of different attributes
to be successful and so if you

2026
01:48:38,670 --> 01:48:43,440
overvalue one or another and
you devalue other things,

2027
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:46,650
you're not going to be as successful as
you could. You might still be successful,

2028
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:49,470
but you're not going to reach the pinnacle
because you're not putting yourself

2029
01:48:49,471 --> 01:48:50,370
into the right situation.

2030
01:48:50,630 --> 01:48:53,060
It's funny because in a lot of ways
it's like what you were talking about

2031
01:48:53,061 --> 01:48:53,361
earlier,

2032
01:48:53,361 --> 01:48:58,280
the two sides of the coin of a fighter
being a wild person who doesn't care,

2033
01:48:58,281 --> 01:49:01,750
the cowboy and then the other
guy who's like super systematic,

2034
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:03,320
everything's controlled.
Yeah.

2035
01:49:03,321 --> 01:49:06,740
You almost have to have everything and
the fighters that have those really

2036
01:49:06,741 --> 01:49:11,000
strong attributes just have to be aware
that those attributes are strengthened

2037
01:49:11,001 --> 01:49:12,470
even further by technique.

2038
01:49:12,610 --> 01:49:16,360
Yeah. 100%. And, and, and again,
it's both sides of the coin in me.

2039
01:49:16,370 --> 01:49:17,900
Another one would be, uh, you know,

2040
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:20,800
something I called beginner's
mind and then know it all right.

2041
01:49:20,801 --> 01:49:22,540
And when you come into,
when you come into practice,

2042
01:49:22,541 --> 01:49:24,070
you need to have a beginner's mind.
I mean,

2043
01:49:24,610 --> 01:49:28,060
I got to work out with three or four
time world champion Olympic Champ Jorn

2044
01:49:28,060 --> 01:49:30,010
Pearl's last week.
And he was asking me questions.

2045
01:49:30,040 --> 01:49:35,040
It's like this guy really cared about
learning from every possible source and

2046
01:49:35,171 --> 01:49:38,020
he's already, he's already at the
pinnacle and still trying to learn.

2047
01:49:38,070 --> 01:49:40,200
Interesting thing to
Dominick. Cruz said, uh,

2048
01:49:40,230 --> 01:49:43,260
during the broadcast about steep
immuno chick that Steve Bay,

2049
01:49:43,261 --> 01:49:45,690
when he went to alliance and
the man was asking everybody,

2050
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,040
you have to. Yeah. But
then when you go into

2051
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:52,180
a competition, you can't have the same
mindset and thinking, I don't know,

2052
01:49:52,181 --> 01:49:55,270
I need to ask. Right.
And so like kids who,

2053
01:49:55,690 --> 01:49:57,610
kids who have just the beginner's mind,
they'll,

2054
01:49:57,640 --> 01:49:59,650
they're great in practice but then
they go into a mash and I coach,

2055
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:01,650
watch I do here, what should I
do? What should you do? It's like,

2056
01:50:01,740 --> 01:50:04,440
well just go wrestle, wrestle, you know.

2057
01:50:04,460 --> 01:50:07,450
But then kids are coming to
practice like I know it. All right,

2058
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:10,180
well that's a very unhealthy mindset
also cause you when it's great,

2059
01:50:10,181 --> 01:50:12,580
when you compete, it's great
when you compete. So you got it.

2060
01:50:12,581 --> 01:50:16,180
You've got to balance both those things,
right? Like you can't have just one.

2061
01:50:16,181 --> 01:50:19,300
Cause if you're, I know it all. I'm a
bad ass. That's great for competition.

2062
01:50:19,301 --> 01:50:21,760
But you come into practice,
you're going to stop.

2063
01:50:21,761 --> 01:50:25,300
You're learning right now
when you're coaching kids,

2064
01:50:25,750 --> 01:50:30,100
how much time, if any, do
you spend on mindset? Um,

2065
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:33,550
and so every, I added my Facebook
every Monday, do this mental Monday,

2066
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:37,570
and then I usually repeat repeated or
something fairly similar to the kids at

2067
01:50:37,571 --> 01:50:40,570
practice. But I also think
it's a lot, you know,

2068
01:50:40,571 --> 01:50:42,970
I think competition is
where you get your really,

2069
01:50:42,971 --> 01:50:46,480
really good teachable moments because
that's when kids care the most.

2070
01:50:46,870 --> 01:50:50,680
And so like the kid I was talking about
when he loses it because he didn't want

2071
01:50:50,681 --> 01:50:53,650
to listen to me, I can say, well, look
at, look at this. This is a great example.

2072
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:57,250
You know, I, I did this, I do private
lessons with this fourth and fifth grader.

2073
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:01,540
They're brothers and, uh, and like five
weeks in a row you're doing this wrong.

2074
01:51:01,660 --> 01:51:04,150
You're doing this wrong. You're doing
this wrong. You're doing this wrong.

2075
01:51:04,570 --> 01:51:06,370
They don't want to listen.
Right? Right. Then they do it.

2076
01:51:06,371 --> 01:51:09,730
They have a match last week they do it
wrong and it didn't cost him the match,

2077
01:51:09,731 --> 01:51:11,580
but it almost cost them the match.
And,

2078
01:51:11,810 --> 01:51:14,320
and now I can say every single time I see
you're doing this wrong. Or I can say,

2079
01:51:14,321 --> 01:51:16,630
remember that time in that match when
you got put it in your back because you

2080
01:51:16,631 --> 01:51:20,690
did it wrong and you refuse to
listen to me. So I think that, uh,

2081
01:51:20,780 --> 01:51:23,710
matches create great teachable
moments. You know, like, Hey,

2082
01:51:23,711 --> 01:51:26,620
you remember when you wilted under the
pressure because you weren't tough enough?

2083
01:51:26,650 --> 01:51:29,380
Well, you need to practice a little
harder. So you get used to that pressure.

2084
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:34,420
Remember when the referee made a bad call
and you flipped out because he made a

2085
01:51:34,421 --> 01:51:36,010
bad call and they didn't think about,
well,

2086
01:51:36,011 --> 01:51:39,430
I still have to wrestle the rest of his
match, right? So there could be all these,

2087
01:51:39,490 --> 01:51:42,970
there's all these teachable moments
within competition where you can say point

2088
01:51:42,971 --> 01:51:44,500
to something very clearly and say,
well,

2089
01:51:44,501 --> 01:51:48,130
look at this and see how this affected
you and see how you would have been more

2090
01:51:48,131 --> 01:51:48,850
successful.

2091
01:51:48,850 --> 01:51:52,540
So I think from mental aspect that
comes a lot more on one on one basis.

2092
01:51:52,541 --> 01:51:55,210
And sometimes I'll use it in front of
the whole team. I don't, I don't like,

2093
01:51:55,240 --> 01:52:00,000
like really picking on people, uh,
every once in a while I will. Um,

2094
01:52:00,310 --> 01:52:01,071
but so I think the,

2095
01:52:01,071 --> 01:52:04,450
I think there's competition provides a
lot of teachable moments for athletes to

2096
01:52:04,451 --> 01:52:08,440
see, well, am I stronger here?
What do I need to work on?
Because we, again, we can't,

2097
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:11,770
you can't say one mental aspect
makes the guy successful.

2098
01:52:11,771 --> 01:52:13,810
It's this conglomeration of many,
many,

2099
01:52:13,811 --> 01:52:17,740
many mental aspects that'll
make you highly successful.
Now when you're coaching,

2100
01:52:17,741 --> 01:52:21,700
whether it's coaching wrestlers or MMA,
final coach, movie theaters anymore. None.

2101
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:23,020
Zero. I how, okay.

2102
01:52:23,021 --> 01:52:27,250
I help a couple buddies but I don't
consider it and really just help us.

2103
01:52:27,790 --> 01:52:30,090
Let's say, just say, when you're
coaching restaurants, do you,

2104
01:52:30,490 --> 01:52:34,720
do you concentrate it all on strength
and conditioning or is it from the

2105
01:52:34,721 --> 01:52:39,020
wrestling that you get most
of your strength conditioning?
So we only got them,

2106
01:52:39,250 --> 01:52:41,620
you know, an hour and a half,
three or four times a week.

2107
01:52:41,621 --> 01:52:44,440
And so we don't do a lot of strength
conditioning. I know I read,

2108
01:52:44,441 --> 01:52:47,570
especially with the older guys, I
recommend they do some on their own. Um,

2109
01:52:47,630 --> 01:52:49,070
you know,
for a college program,

2110
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:52,520
for High School program where we're
getting them Monday through Saturday,

2111
01:52:52,610 --> 01:52:55,430
maybe twice a day possibly. Obviously
we're in to do that, but you know,

2112
01:52:55,431 --> 01:52:58,310
we're an academy, uh, you
know, we're kind of on our own.

2113
01:52:58,311 --> 01:52:59,630
We get them three or four times a week,

2114
01:52:59,631 --> 01:53:03,710
so it just doesn't Trump what we
need to do in that short time window.

2115
01:53:04,210 --> 01:53:05,770
How do you balance it out though?
Like,

2116
01:53:05,771 --> 01:53:08,680
how do you know how much strength and
conditioning to do versus how much

2117
01:53:08,681 --> 01:53:09,980
technique and skill work?

2118
01:53:10,260 --> 01:53:12,900
I mean at the college level are we
talking about are because we do not,

2119
01:53:12,901 --> 01:53:16,000
we do know strength conditioning and I
recommend kids do on their own and you

2120
01:53:16,001 --> 01:53:19,970
know, and if I had 12 hours a week with
them, I would do that. But we, you know,

2121
01:53:19,971 --> 01:53:24,900
we don't, we don't have that ability
to, um, I think, I think it's important.

2122
01:53:24,901 --> 01:53:27,060
I think it's really important.
I don't think it tries.

2123
01:53:27,061 --> 01:53:28,950
I don't think it trumps
especially knowledge.

2124
01:53:28,980 --> 01:53:32,110
And then if kids wrestle really hard
against each other and kill HUD that one

2125
01:53:32,111 --> 01:53:34,350
saying like wrestling is the
best strength conditioning.

2126
01:53:34,351 --> 01:53:35,570
I can't remember he said something,
something,

2127
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,770
if you wrestle really
hard against each other,

2128
01:53:37,771 --> 01:53:39,390
you're going to develop those things.
And it's like,

2129
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:43,110
I think like people went when I grabbed
people are squeezed people, they're like,

2130
01:53:43,111 --> 01:53:44,550
oh my God,
I've never felt anything like it.

2131
01:53:45,030 --> 01:53:47,760
And I think that comes from that doesn't
come. If you put me in a weight room,

2132
01:53:47,761 --> 01:53:51,180
I can do nothing abnormal. I am not
abnormally strong in any exercise.

2133
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:53,430
I'm actually like on a
college division one costume,

2134
01:53:53,490 --> 01:53:56,640
I'm significantly less strong
than most people. Right.

2135
01:53:56,641 --> 01:53:58,320
But then when they wrestle me
and they're like, Holy Shit,

2136
01:53:58,321 --> 01:53:59,520
I never felt anything like that.

2137
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:04,140
And I think it's because a lot of
those things that I do are very, very,

2138
01:54:04,141 --> 01:54:05,730
very wrestling specific.

2139
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:08,470
And I developed that strength
because when I grabbed some impacts,

2140
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:10,440
like freaking grab him as hard
as I can when I squeezed them,

2141
01:54:10,620 --> 01:54:14,070
I squeeze him as hard as I can as an now
from doing that thousands of times I've

2142
01:54:14,071 --> 01:54:16,950
developed that squeezer that strength.
Um,

2143
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:19,080
and so I think the strength
conditioning is important,

2144
01:54:19,081 --> 01:54:20,790
but I don't think it
trumps doing other stuff.

2145
01:54:20,791 --> 01:54:23,820
And if I had all the time in the world
and these kids didn't have to go to high

2146
01:54:23,821 --> 01:54:26,460
school or Middle School, I'd probably
put them through some. But you know,

2147
01:54:26,461 --> 01:54:27,390
we don't have that luxury.

2148
01:54:27,670 --> 01:54:29,650
What did you do when
you were finding an MMA?

2149
01:54:29,651 --> 01:54:31,530
How much did you devote to
strength to get conditioning?

2150
01:54:31,730 --> 01:54:35,210
Twice a week, ish and maybe three
sometimes. What kind of stuff?

2151
01:54:35,780 --> 01:54:38,790
So I had a personal trainer since I
moved to Milwaukee. I actually ended up,

2152
01:54:38,791 --> 01:54:42,260
I actually, I helped him
open up a crossfit gym. Um,

2153
01:54:42,710 --> 01:54:46,550
and it wouldn't be that
specifically crossfit workouts,

2154
01:54:46,551 --> 01:54:48,960
but kind of that type of
work. Nothing slow. We're,

2155
01:54:48,961 --> 01:54:51,850
I'm doing three sets of 10
and two sets, a, you know,

2156
01:54:51,870 --> 01:54:56,000
nothing slow like that potentially,
you know, one, one or two days.

2157
01:54:56,001 --> 01:54:59,780
We might do like a slower start and
then, but you know, I think fighting,

2158
01:54:59,781 --> 01:55:01,730
you need to be very highly active.
You know,

2159
01:55:01,731 --> 01:55:04,160
you need to be in really good shape and
need bill to move a lot of things really

2160
01:55:04,161 --> 01:55:04,491
fast.

2161
01:55:04,491 --> 01:55:08,180
So kind of cross it type stuff I think
is probably the right direction to go.

2162
01:55:08,181 --> 01:55:12,710
And now when I go back to college programs
besides like the heavyweights that in

2163
01:55:12,711 --> 01:55:16,490
season stuff for college programs
is mostly higher pay stuff,

2164
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:20,630
which I think is, you know, very
relevant to both wrestling and fighting.

2165
01:55:20,950 --> 01:55:22,480
So did you do,

2166
01:55:22,510 --> 01:55:25,390
when you were saying like you were
doing like crossfit style workouts,

2167
01:55:25,550 --> 01:55:28,960
so are you doing like kettle
bells box jumps, like everything?

2168
01:55:29,380 --> 01:55:31,690
So when I said that, I just
meant that we, you know,

2169
01:55:31,700 --> 01:55:34,450
we are moving at a high pace
through a lot of stuff, you know,

2170
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:37,600
and it would be like, he would tell me,
hey Diego, do some no. Do sled pushes.

2171
01:55:37,601 --> 01:55:39,080
Do this. Do that. Do that though.

2172
01:55:39,081 --> 01:55:43,020
What about like your diet and
nutrition and supplements and things?

2173
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:44,100
Those have never

2174
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:48,780
been, uh, that much into
nutrition. I saw it.

2175
01:55:48,781 --> 01:55:51,720
I said I don't. Okay. I was fat
when I was a little kid. Right.

2176
01:55:51,930 --> 01:55:54,840
K Too much at age 11. I said,
I don't wanna be fat anymore.

2177
01:55:54,870 --> 01:55:59,520
So I went from 130 pounds, 100 pounds
in Tam, you lost 30 pounds and 11.

2178
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:03,210
Fifth grade, sixth grade, six one year.
100 pounds. That's a lot of weight.

2179
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:07,280
That's 30% of your body. Well, yeah,
I was fat. I was fat as shit. Oh,

2180
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:11,110
you eating everything and you were
wrestling into, yeah. Now you know, I was,

2181
01:56:11,230 --> 01:56:13,920
I was having some success because when
you're fat or there's not as many people

2182
01:56:13,921 --> 01:56:17,940
to compete against, right. So anyway,
so I lost 30 pounds, six grade.

2183
01:56:17,941 --> 01:56:21,450
So I stopped drinking soda.
I had this whole whole list of stuff.

2184
01:56:21,451 --> 01:56:25,820
I just cut out discipline at 11. Yeah,
I know. And that's uh, that's an,

2185
01:56:25,830 --> 01:56:28,730
I want to look at kids. I think. I
think the mental maturity is huge in,

2186
01:56:28,780 --> 01:56:31,890
in longterm success. Being
able to make, like, see,

2187
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:34,950
see the future and make decisions on
what you want to do at that young age.

2188
01:56:35,250 --> 01:56:39,360
So I lost 30 pounds and so now I have
slowly started like reintroducing a lot of

2189
01:56:39,361 --> 01:56:43,490
stuff by, it's like sodas gross. I haven't
drank a soda and forever, you know what?

2190
01:56:43,491 --> 01:56:47,230
They're growing fast food. I cut out
fast food. I don't, I don't ever like,

2191
01:56:47,330 --> 01:56:50,760
they haven't eaten fast food in 20 years.
I mean, it's just disgusting, you know?

2192
01:56:50,790 --> 01:56:54,270
And so like I eat generally healthy.
My wife and I cook at home a lot.

2193
01:56:54,271 --> 01:56:57,510
We make really healthy food. Um, and so,

2194
01:56:57,511 --> 01:57:02,370
but I don't take any supplements. Zero, no
multivitamin, nothing, nothing, nothing.

2195
01:57:02,490 --> 01:57:07,200
So you get all your nutrients from
your food. And I just figured like I,

2196
01:57:07,201 --> 01:57:09,900
so I called, I tried a couple of
supplements in college. I never,

2197
01:57:09,901 --> 01:57:13,080
I never felt anything from them. Like
I didn't feel any different, you know.

2198
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:17,130
And so I'm like, Eh, I didn't
feel anything. Why am I,
why am I going to take that?

2199
01:57:17,131 --> 01:57:21,360
I don't need to take it. And then so
then obviously I became like this, uh,

2200
01:57:21,420 --> 01:57:26,310
anti p e d crusader it, you know,
by chance. And so then it's like,

2201
01:57:26,311 --> 01:57:29,100
well now I really can't take anything
because if I go take something and I pop

2202
01:57:29,101 --> 01:57:32,050
hot because these idiots
or putting something in
supplement supplement should be

2203
01:57:32,051 --> 01:57:35,490
there. I'm, it was like a total
asshole. So I literally, I don't,

2204
01:57:35,670 --> 01:57:39,810
I didn't even take protein. I met,
took nothing. Wow. Yeah. That's crazy.

2205
01:57:39,990 --> 01:57:42,960
So did you make sure that you ate
the proper amount of vegetables?

2206
01:57:42,961 --> 01:57:47,010
Green leafy vegetables, eat some
food and Latin script? I mean,

2207
01:57:48,110 --> 01:57:52,230
you know, like it's like healthy food.
Like, we're eating salads and of course,

2208
01:57:52,231 --> 01:57:56,670
you know, I'm not eating cake and ice
cream and pizza and that kind of stuff,

2209
01:57:56,790 --> 01:57:58,440
and we're eating healthy food at my house,
you know,

2210
01:57:58,441 --> 01:58:03,441
but I'm not measuring the grams of this
or ground to that or so I really think,

2211
01:58:03,481 --> 01:58:04,261
what am I?
And I,

2212
01:58:04,261 --> 01:58:08,490
this has been proven by science that
you only have a certain amount of time

2213
01:58:08,491 --> 01:58:11,310
every single day to have a high
amount of mental focus on stuff.

2214
01:58:11,670 --> 01:58:15,060
And so I think like my training is more
important than focusing on nutrition and

2215
01:58:15,061 --> 01:58:15,391
stuff.

2216
01:58:15,391 --> 01:58:20,391
And so I want to really like really
zoning in really high level focus when I'm

2217
01:58:20,971 --> 01:58:23,880
training and stuff. And so I think
if I worry about all this stuff,

2218
01:58:23,881 --> 01:58:26,820
it'll take my focus away from
that. Right, right or wrong.

2219
01:58:26,821 --> 01:58:29,460
That's kind of how I thought about it.
And it was a smart way to approach it.

2220
01:58:29,610 --> 01:58:32,430
And it never really affected me.
I mean, uh, like I said, you know,

2221
01:58:32,431 --> 01:58:35,460
even when I took the supplements in
college, I never really felt them at all.

2222
01:58:35,461 --> 01:58:38,760
So it's like, well, if I don't feel
it, why would I do it? You know,

2223
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:39,810
kind of ironic though,

2224
01:58:39,811 --> 01:58:42,730
that you were an anti-drug crusader
and you went to the one place,

2225
01:58:42,731 --> 01:58:47,630
it doesn't drug test. I know, right? It
really hurt me. It hurt me. A crazy is,

2226
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:49,660
you know, and it is, if you look at,

2227
01:58:49,690 --> 01:58:52,450
so we talked about like Singapore being
so fantastic and having a really high

2228
01:58:52,451 --> 01:58:56,530
GDP. A lot of the countries
over there, uh, Indonesia,

2229
01:58:56,920 --> 01:59:00,320
Manila, they, Manila, Philippines, um,

2230
01:59:00,820 --> 01:59:05,140
they don't have huge high GDPs, right? I
mean they're not super wealthy countries.

2231
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:07,300
And so when we think about,
you know,

2232
01:59:07,301 --> 01:59:12,220
how much it costs to buy a lot of the
steroids that are readily available in

2233
01:59:12,221 --> 01:59:16,330
America, they're just not as available.
And so I think they do have a point.

2234
01:59:16,750 --> 01:59:18,250
And if you look at the athletes,

2235
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:20,530
there's not a lot of athletes
that look like Yoel Romero.

2236
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:23,320
Now you'll notice probably not using,
like I pointed out earlier,

2237
01:59:23,380 --> 01:59:26,920
while he's tested clean,
except once it was tainted supplement,

2238
01:59:26,921 --> 01:59:28,690
but they proved that it
was a tainted supplement.

2239
01:59:28,780 --> 01:59:32,650
So when you look at their athletes,
maybe except a few of the Russian ones,

2240
01:59:32,651 --> 01:59:37,030
they look pretty normal.
Like it's probably unlikely
that they're using from my,

2241
01:59:37,031 --> 01:59:40,870
for a few Russian ones, let's say
for rocks and they can't help it.

2242
01:59:41,290 --> 01:59:45,490
It's like part of the culture. I
can't help it. Yeah. That one Russian,

2243
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:50,520
the one Russian guy that I fought in
April of 16 he was freaking enormous.

2244
01:59:51,341 --> 01:59:52,180
And you know,

2245
01:59:52,181 --> 01:59:57,181
the other thing that I think a lot of MMA
people are using some type of uh oh my

2246
01:59:57,911 --> 02:00:01,450
gosh, I'm blanking. What, what gives you
endurance, EPO, EPO, that type of stuff.

2247
02:00:01,451 --> 02:00:03,110
Because if you watch a college wrestler,

2248
02:00:03,140 --> 02:00:07,180
that's how tired people get in seven
minutes and then we're fighting 25 minutes

2249
02:00:07,181 --> 02:00:09,700
and you're not going to get tired.
Like that's not normal. Well,

2250
02:00:09,701 --> 02:00:12,040
people definitely tested hot for that.
And the UFC,

2251
02:00:13,420 --> 02:00:17,740
who's the guy that fought mighty mouse?
Yeah. There is a routine of Russia. Crazy.

2252
02:00:17,741 --> 02:00:21,310
Yeah. So, but I think more people are
using that. And I think if you, you know,

2253
02:00:21,311 --> 02:00:23,050
you don't,
I don't have any conclusive evidence,

2254
02:00:23,051 --> 02:00:25,390
but if you look at when you sort of
started and then how somebody is,

2255
02:00:25,391 --> 02:00:29,710
people fell down straight down.
Their bodies are different.

2256
02:00:29,740 --> 02:00:31,830
They look different,
they're competent, you know,

2257
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:33,580
Johnny Hendricks would be one
that comes to mind. I mean,

2258
02:00:33,581 --> 02:00:36,040
what's his freaking record since
you saw it ain't very good.

2259
02:00:36,041 --> 02:00:39,070
I'll tell you that much. And all of a
sudden he can't make weight. And you know,

2260
02:00:39,071 --> 02:00:41,950
if you remember, so obviously I
watched Johnny because he was,

2261
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:43,070
I couldn't stay on Johnny.

2262
02:00:43,570 --> 02:00:48,010
He beat me when we were 17 and
then I tried to wrestle my senior,

2263
02:00:48,011 --> 02:00:49,300
so we were different.
He was one 65,

2264
02:00:49,301 --> 02:00:52,360
I was on 74 and I want to wrestle
wrestling for the all star classic.

2265
02:00:52,361 --> 02:00:55,840
And I called the, the people who put it
on and said I want to wrestle him. And uh,

2266
02:00:55,841 --> 02:00:57,880
they turned the match down.
So that's, I've kind of like,

2267
02:00:58,150 --> 02:01:01,480
I wanted to get that one back and I never
got to get it back from when I was 17

2268
02:01:01,780 --> 02:01:03,570
so I've been falling giant pretty closely.

2269
02:01:04,360 --> 02:01:09,280
If you watched Johnny like a constant
fight and prior to that he gets so tired

2270
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:12,370
in like two rounds. Right?
And we just felt exhausted,

2271
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:15,850
exhausted and then all of sudden he's
going these five round fights and you're

2272
02:01:15,851 --> 02:01:16,840
like,
Whoa,

2273
02:01:17,380 --> 02:01:20,650
how are you going to get tired and that
exhausted in two rounds and now you can

2274
02:01:20,651 --> 02:01:24,340
five for five rounds. Johnny, like what's
going on here? I mean in his defense,

2275
02:01:24,370 --> 02:01:26,460
I don't got to improve team take down.
They,

2276
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:29,950
they implemented a pretty
fantastic program over there.

2277
02:01:29,951 --> 02:01:32,830
I mean they spend a lot of money on it.
That was the whole thing where they were,

2278
02:01:33,220 --> 02:01:36,160
they were paying him then they
wanted 50% of his earnings.

2279
02:01:36,280 --> 02:01:39,350
I got the same offer right out of college.
You? Yeah, we were both Grad Joe Seven.

2280
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:40,040
How does that work?

2281
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:41,750
I felt like he was betting it's myself.

2282
02:01:42,200 --> 02:01:44,780
They pay you $100,000
a year for seven years.

2283
02:01:45,200 --> 02:01:48,500
They got 50% of your career earnings.
And I said, my thought was, well,

2284
02:01:48,860 --> 02:01:50,570
if I ever make it really big,

2285
02:01:50,571 --> 02:01:54,080
I'm going to make $1 million a fight and
I'm going to pay him back in one fight.

2286
02:01:54,110 --> 02:01:55,580
You know, like it's, it's a,

2287
02:01:55,590 --> 02:01:58,300
it would be like hedging your bet against
yourself and I don't ever bet against

2288
02:01:58,301 --> 02:02:02,360
myself. Yeah. But for them I get it too.

2289
02:02:02,361 --> 02:02:05,780
It's like they have to have some sort
of a reason to put out there and it's a

2290
02:02:05,970 --> 02:02:08,690
big bet whether or not you're
going to be able to be. Absolutely.

2291
02:02:08,691 --> 02:02:11,990
Plus if you think you suck, it's
good to take that bet. If you think,

2292
02:02:11,991 --> 02:02:13,430
I don't know if I'm going to make a dog,

2293
02:02:13,790 --> 02:02:16,760
I'm okay with making it a little bit
of money. Yeah. Then it's a good bet.

2294
02:02:16,790 --> 02:02:20,260
It doesn't seem like the best strategy.
It doesn't seem,

2295
02:02:20,261 --> 02:02:21,680
I mean it's interesting and I think,

2296
02:02:21,681 --> 02:02:24,180
I think there's probably somewhere
in there with, you know, I,

2297
02:02:24,190 --> 02:02:26,570
I know a few manage it and
it's where you go pick out,

2298
02:02:26,590 --> 02:02:29,780
it's pretty proven that hello
call adjusters are going
to make really damn good

2299
02:02:29,781 --> 02:02:33,590
fighters. That's pretty proven itself.
Going to try to find a couple every year,

2300
02:02:34,040 --> 02:02:36,950
spending some money on them and then
getting a percentage of their earnings.

2301
02:02:36,951 --> 02:02:38,330
It's probably a pretty,

2302
02:02:38,420 --> 02:02:42,020
I don't want to say a safe bet for the
people putting out the money, but it's,

2303
02:02:42,530 --> 02:02:43,730
you know, take down team, take down,

2304
02:02:43,731 --> 02:02:47,750
had Jake rush Holt who was an amazing
wrestler and for whatever reason he just

2305
02:02:47,900 --> 02:02:49,880
didn't transition great to
fighting. Right. And you know,

2306
02:02:50,030 --> 02:02:53,240
he was good but he wasn't great and it
was like for as good of a wrestler's he

2307
02:02:53,241 --> 02:02:56,930
was probably 30 it can be a little better.
Yeah. What do you think is the factor?

2308
02:02:56,931 --> 02:02:58,110
Like if you had to look at it,

2309
02:02:58,120 --> 02:03:01,820
the Mosler cause there's not
a lot of outliers like that.

2310
02:03:02,270 --> 02:03:05,450
Like where you don't like [inaudible].
And so when we talk about how good Jake,

2311
02:03:05,451 --> 02:03:07,880
right, he still made the UFC,
he still won some fights.

2312
02:03:07,881 --> 02:03:11,670
So it was like he wasn't a bad fighter,
but he's a three time NCAA champs.

2313
02:03:11,671 --> 02:03:15,680
So you expect him, Hey, he'll probably go
challenge for a UFC title. Right. So I,

2314
02:03:15,681 --> 02:03:19,670
you know, in his case, I don't
know what the factor was. Um,

2315
02:03:20,600 --> 02:03:23,360
but there's not a lot of outliers like
that where it's there are a really high

2316
02:03:23,361 --> 02:03:27,020
level wrestler and then they don't have
any success. MMA that's really unique.

2317
02:03:27,050 --> 02:03:28,940
You don't see it a lot. Yeah, it's,

2318
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:33,710
it's interesting like I've looked at
it from striking from if you see like

2319
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:38,740
really high level kickboxers some have
a style that would readily translate to

2320
02:03:39,141 --> 02:03:43,400
MMA and some are fantastic kickboxers
like maybe Peter Hertz is a good example

2321
02:03:43,401 --> 02:03:46,430
or a Nesto who's where I wouldn't really
think that they would translate that

2322
02:03:46,431 --> 02:03:47,360
well to MMA.

2323
02:03:47,480 --> 02:03:52,030
Whereas Mirko Cro cop who might've been
like a slight notch below them in terms

2324
02:03:52,031 --> 02:03:57,031
of kickboxing translates perfectly to
MMA cause he's so explosive and quail and

2325
02:03:57,261 --> 02:04:00,700
I would want them decent takedown defense
too. He still kept it for a while.

2326
02:04:00,701 --> 02:04:01,281
They developed it.

2327
02:04:01,281 --> 02:04:06,281
But the thing about Mirko was unbelievable
power and speed and he could just

2328
02:04:06,651 --> 02:04:08,430
close the distance quickly and blast.
Yeah.

2329
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:13,610
And I think that is w difference between
that and a guy who's like methodical

2330
02:04:13,611 --> 02:04:17,480
set things up. Those guys didn't do as
well. They didn't translate as well.

2331
02:04:17,481 --> 02:04:20,370
They get tooken taken down to what,

2332
02:04:21,030 --> 02:04:23,340
what would you think
would be like, well, it's,

2333
02:04:23,380 --> 02:04:25,690
it's very different guns you don't want,

2334
02:04:25,691 --> 02:04:29,180
the other things I think benefits us
wrestlers is the fact that Jujitsu people

2335
02:04:29,181 --> 02:04:31,460
are stuck on doing Jujitsu,
the Jew two way, right?

2336
02:04:31,550 --> 02:04:35,030
Strikers are stuck on striking
when we come into MMA,

2337
02:04:35,210 --> 02:04:40,080
we know we can't win a match just by
wrestling. Right? So we know, we know.

2338
02:04:40,110 --> 02:04:43,980
I've got to add striking. I gotta I gotta
add Jujitsu and I'm open to that idea,

2339
02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:46,980
right? I'm open to those ideas that I
have to add those things into my arsenal.

2340
02:04:46,981 --> 02:04:49,050
Where'd you'd, some Jujitsu
guys are like, well,

2341
02:04:49,051 --> 02:04:51,720
I'm just going to submit them and
they don't, they don't develop their,

2342
02:04:51,721 --> 02:04:56,460
I mean there's, there, you can
literally not name me Joe, uh,

2343
02:04:56,610 --> 02:05:00,000
a Jujitsu guy or a striking guy.
Well,

2344
02:05:00,001 --> 02:05:03,030
maybe Jose Aldo who has
developed high level wrestling,

2345
02:05:03,270 --> 02:05:07,890
but you can name a lot of wrestlers who've
developed high levels, something else,

2346
02:05:08,340 --> 02:05:12,570
right? I mean, when you see the cross
over, like Jon Jones was a wrestler,

2347
02:05:12,990 --> 02:05:15,510
he can strike with pretty much
anyone on the planet, right.

2348
02:05:15,580 --> 02:05:17,610
It means steep meo chick was a wrestler.

2349
02:05:17,970 --> 02:05:19,830
He can pretty much track when
they don't on the planet. I mean,

2350
02:05:19,831 --> 02:05:23,460
so you have these wrestlers who are
becoming high level at these other skills,

2351
02:05:23,461 --> 02:05:27,330
but you don't have a lot of other skills
becoming a high level of wrestling.

2352
02:05:27,330 --> 02:05:28,170
And I, and I'm, for me,

2353
02:05:28,171 --> 02:05:31,200
I think it's the stubbornness of people
who come from those other backgrounds or

2354
02:05:31,201 --> 02:05:35,010
too stubborn to want to work a lot in
wrestling where it's wrestlers are like,

2355
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:37,230
okay, teach panel strike.
Yeah. I think it's a,

2356
02:05:37,231 --> 02:05:39,300
it's a recognition of what's important.

2357
02:05:39,301 --> 02:05:41,450
Like George Saint Pierre is a
perfect example of a garden.

2358
02:05:41,470 --> 02:05:43,140
Started off with a killed
Christian background,

2359
02:05:43,141 --> 02:05:46,230
didn't wrestle in college or high school,
became a fantastic restaurant.

2360
02:05:46,290 --> 02:05:48,750
He's good. Yeah. And just
figured it out and realized,

2361
02:05:48,870 --> 02:05:51,540
realize what a critical skill
it is too. Yeah, absolutely.

2362
02:05:51,630 --> 02:05:55,730
So there's a handful of very small
handful. Jose Aldo would be like, eh,

2363
02:05:55,750 --> 02:05:57,840
he wasn't an offensive wrestler,
but who'd be like,

2364
02:05:57,870 --> 02:06:02,040
he was so ridiculously hard to take down.
I mean fantastic takedown defense.

2365
02:06:02,041 --> 02:06:04,020
And so there, there's a handful,
but there's not a lot. And then,

2366
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:08,850
but then if you go to wrestlers going
opposite direction into Jujitsu or

2367
02:06:08,851 --> 02:06:09,601
striking,
you know,

2368
02:06:09,601 --> 02:06:13,050
you can name quite a few that were able
to do those things really well. You know,

2369
02:06:13,051 --> 02:06:16,930
it's interesting when you see a guy like
Khabib number Grumet off and you see

2370
02:06:16,931 --> 02:06:19,320
these fantastic fuck yeah.
And his,

2371
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:23,730
his mauling wrestling.
I mean,

2372
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:28,410
you see what a massive factor it is.
Fights like the Edson Barboza fight.

2373
02:06:28,600 --> 02:06:32,370
Yeah. That to me is one of the
perfect examples. When I say, look,

2374
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:35,490
the ability to take guy down and
control them on the ground is the,

2375
02:06:36,540 --> 02:06:38,100
it's the bottom of the pyramid.

2376
02:06:38,130 --> 02:06:41,910
It's the most important foundation
because he dictates where the fight takes

2377
02:06:41,911 --> 02:06:44,460
place. Yeah. You might catch him when
he's coming in and trying to get you,

2378
02:06:44,490 --> 02:06:47,580
you might, but if he gets you, he was
like a fricking terminator though.

2379
02:06:47,581 --> 02:06:49,740
He was just like, I'm just
going to come get you. Yeah.

2380
02:06:49,741 --> 02:06:54,741
He just ate kicks for each address and
there's no hope constant chasing him

2381
02:06:55,141 --> 02:06:58,860
around chasing him. Right. It was. It was
insane. Yeah. No, he's fantastic. Yeah.

2382
02:06:59,070 --> 02:06:59,311
But no,

2383
02:06:59,311 --> 02:07:03,120
I would totally agree that at the bottom
of the pyramid it's like the is the

2384
02:07:03,121 --> 02:07:06,080
Trump card. If like if you fighting a
wrestler and you can't stop a takedown,

2385
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:09,300
you're going to lose 90% of the
time. Yeah. You know, and if,

2386
02:07:09,570 --> 02:07:12,360
if you're the wrestler and you can
go get a take down really easily,

2387
02:07:12,450 --> 02:07:13,740
you're going to win 90% of the time.

2388
02:07:13,950 --> 02:07:18,950
The only wild card in that equation is
a guy like Brian or tig fights so well

2389
02:07:18,991 --> 02:07:21,930
off his back. But how many
people get submissions from
garden? How many of those?

2390
02:07:21,931 --> 02:07:23,020
Yeah, it's me. Even like any,

2391
02:07:23,030 --> 02:07:25,230
any Anthony Pettis who got
a lot of submissions regard.

2392
02:07:26,100 --> 02:07:29,990
A lot of that was transitions off of I
body kick, Benson Harrison, I body kick,

2393
02:07:30,020 --> 02:07:31,950
Ben Sanders and Benson.
Harrison hates getting body kicks.

2394
02:07:31,951 --> 02:07:35,190
So he dives in for a take down. It gets
arm armbar right. Or Guilt Melendez.

2395
02:07:35,530 --> 02:07:36,130
Getting Guillotine

2396
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:38,800
choke cause he got jacked a
few times. Right. So there are,

2397
02:07:38,801 --> 02:07:41,620
there's a handful of those but
just strictly like I take you down,

2398
02:07:41,621 --> 02:07:43,670
you're in guard,
then I submit you right.

2399
02:07:44,050 --> 02:07:47,410
Maybe for Bri silver doom every once
in a while. Maybe Brian or Tega.

2400
02:07:47,411 --> 02:07:49,060
But the numbers pretty damn small.

2401
02:07:49,140 --> 02:07:50,040
It is very small.

2402
02:07:50,150 --> 02:07:53,710
It's smaller now than I think ever before
because people understand the takedown,

2403
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,530
the guard defense.

2404
02:07:55,640 --> 02:07:56,930
Yeah.
Even like this guy that I,

2405
02:07:57,140 --> 02:07:59,920
so one of the things that frustrates you
the most more than anything else that

2406
02:07:59,921 --> 02:08:03,350
may is bad strategy. She was like,
drives me up the wallet, that Lima thing.

2407
02:08:03,770 --> 02:08:07,850
But this freaking knucklehead that fought
Michael Chandler on uh, on Saturday.

2408
02:08:07,910 --> 02:08:11,480
I didn't see it as names. Uh,
Gordy Gordy. Yeah. Moo Cheer.

2409
02:08:11,481 --> 02:08:12,800
I don't know his damn name is.

2410
02:08:13,070 --> 02:08:18,070
So the first round he pulls guard like
fast gets frikking hammered on for like

2411
02:08:19,401 --> 02:08:22,640
four minutes and then he ends up
on bottom again. The second round,

2412
02:08:22,850 --> 02:08:27,230
third round he gets taken
down and I dunno, 15 seconds.

2413
02:08:27,260 --> 02:08:29,150
Did he try to get up one time?
No,

2414
02:08:29,151 --> 02:08:31,910
he just laid there and I was asked
what performance in 45 seconds.

2415
02:08:32,270 --> 02:08:35,150
Like everyone's while to try a comer.
Everyone's while to try to triangle,

2416
02:08:35,540 --> 02:08:37,700
but it's like, dude, you're
getting your ass whipped.

2417
02:08:37,701 --> 02:08:41,000
You're down two rounds and nothing.
Try to get up, try to do something,

2418
02:08:41,001 --> 02:08:43,070
change your strategy.
If your strategy is not working,

2419
02:08:43,280 --> 02:08:45,770
you can't just stick with the same
bullshit and get your ass off for another

2420
02:08:45,771 --> 02:08:47,870
four minutes or 45 seconds.
I give me a break.

2421
02:08:47,871 --> 02:08:49,130
What do you think's going
to happen down there?

2422
02:08:49,240 --> 02:08:52,130
Well, I think some guys get
locked into a defensive position.

2423
02:08:52,131 --> 02:08:55,180
Like they realize they're
getting overwhelmed and so
they just try to survive.

2424
02:08:55,230 --> 02:08:57,030
You think so? Yeah. Really? Yeah.

2425
02:08:57,950 --> 02:09:01,040
You don't think that way because you're
a champ and champions don't think that

2426
02:09:01,041 --> 02:09:03,560
way.
But for some people there's a,

2427
02:09:04,010 --> 02:09:08,440
there's a acceptance of their, their
fate, asphalt pennys. This is just,

2428
02:09:08,540 --> 02:09:11,240
they're getting their ass whooped and
so they just try to stay conscious.

2429
02:09:11,241 --> 02:09:14,410
They try to just protect
themselves as much as they can.

2430
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:16,920
Kind of like Edson Barboza but
then you know, it's an instrument.

2431
02:09:16,930 --> 02:09:21,470
Edson Barboza you saw once he
realized he was going to survive,

2432
02:09:21,471 --> 02:09:24,980
like when it was like two minutes
left and third round maybe ish site.

2433
02:09:24,981 --> 02:09:27,600
The first round he's like, I'm getting,
I'm getting fucked up. Just kind of,

2434
02:09:27,610 --> 02:09:30,260
I'm just going to survive. Right? But
then when there was a couple minutes left,

2435
02:09:30,261 --> 02:09:32,090
he's like, no. And he was like,
okay, I'm going to fight again.

2436
02:09:32,500 --> 02:09:34,130
I want to make it through this shit.
I might as well,

2437
02:09:34,250 --> 02:09:37,190
if I were to make it through this, I
might as well just fight back. Right.

2438
02:09:37,230 --> 02:09:40,160
So he started fighting back really hard
like the last two minutes f I tried.

2439
02:09:40,161 --> 02:09:41,090
He certainly tried,

2440
02:09:41,240 --> 02:09:44,020
but there was a period in the middle
where he like had resigned to just taking

2441
02:09:44,030 --> 02:09:44,640
an ass hole open.

2442
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:47,400
Well, I think he was just,
body was just not responding.

2443
02:09:47,401 --> 02:09:51,850
He was getting so fucked up and you could
see the pace that Habib put on a hard

2444
02:09:51,850 --> 02:09:56,670
day. First round, like halfway into
the Round Barboza is like Jesus Christ.

2445
02:09:56,671 --> 02:10:00,270
You see the look in his eyes, got that
thousand yard stare. It's like, Whoa,

2446
02:10:00,730 --> 02:10:03,780
did I signed up for? Yeah,
this guy's on another level.

2447
02:10:03,960 --> 02:10:05,430
I mean he really is on another level.

2448
02:10:05,790 --> 02:10:09,990
I'm fascinated by him
fighting Tony Ferguson and
apparently they're going to do

2449
02:10:09,991 --> 02:10:11,460
that now.
It's sitting happened April.

2450
02:10:11,820 --> 02:10:14,970
I don't know if it's going to be for
the interim title or the actual title

2451
02:10:14,971 --> 02:10:17,220
within. They're going to strip
Connor. They're in a weird,

2452
02:10:17,630 --> 02:10:18,930
I caught it beats up Tony.

2453
02:10:18,990 --> 02:10:22,140
That's just my [inaudible] and I've
underestimated Tony before so I could be

2454
02:10:22,141 --> 02:10:25,620
wrong again. I just think, I
think it's again, Trump card.

2455
02:10:25,621 --> 02:10:28,710
I think Tony's kind of one of those guys
where he's pretty good everywhere is

2456
02:10:29,250 --> 02:10:32,880
pretty damn solid wrestling,
high level Jujitsu. Uh, but I

2457
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:36,320
Khabib's wrestling,
I mean better than Tony's wrestling,

2458
02:10:36,350 --> 02:10:37,670
so it's going to end up on the ground.

2459
02:10:38,060 --> 02:10:42,260
And I think Tony's going to think he can
submit him because his Jujitsu is very

2460
02:10:42,261 --> 02:10:43,094
high level,

2461
02:10:43,190 --> 02:10:45,890
but I think it'll be one those things
where it could be just good enough not to

2462
02:10:45,891 --> 02:10:49,520
get submitted. And then he's going to land
damage and land damage, inland damage,

2463
02:10:49,550 --> 02:10:50,151
inland damage.

2464
02:10:50,151 --> 02:10:53,180
And Tony's going to get close to a
submission and close to a submission,

2465
02:10:53,240 --> 02:10:55,820
close to a submission,
but not quite get it.

2466
02:10:55,940 --> 02:10:59,000
And then all this damage is going to
just accumulate and accumulate and

2467
02:10:59,001 --> 02:11:01,910
accumulate. That's Kinda how I
see it going. It's fascinating.

2468
02:11:01,911 --> 02:11:04,120
And I also think it's
fascinating now that could be,

2469
02:11:04,121 --> 02:11:06,980
but has changed his training
and has a real nutritionist,

2470
02:11:06,990 --> 02:11:08,540
had no problem making weight.
Yeah.

2471
02:11:08,690 --> 02:11:13,400
So all of the factors that played into
him getting removed from the last time

2472
02:11:13,401 --> 02:11:16,820
they were supposed to fight, pulled out
of the car. That was kind of overblown.

2473
02:11:16,821 --> 02:11:21,590
He only missed weight one time.
He only missed w wait one time.

2474
02:11:21,591 --> 02:11:24,650
But his body shut down when he's making
me wait for the Michael Johnson fight in

2475
02:11:24,651 --> 02:11:27,080
a similar way. But he still did
the Michael Johnson fight. Yeah.

2476
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:30,200
But it was the same thing happened
on the way and it was a rough way in.

2477
02:11:30,260 --> 02:11:33,260
But there's been other guys who
missed weight many times. I mean,

2478
02:11:33,261 --> 02:11:37,670
if we go to a Johnny Hendricks,
Johny Hendricks, Melvin
Gallard, Calvin gasoline,

2479
02:11:37,820 --> 02:11:41,630
and they missed it by a long way. So I
thought the cube thing kinda overplayed.

2480
02:11:41,660 --> 02:11:44,900
He missed weight one time. He had some
injuries which sucked for him. Um,

2481
02:11:44,990 --> 02:11:47,950
but it was, that was happening
for a world title fight, you know,

2482
02:11:48,140 --> 02:11:51,260
fighting for the interim title.
He misses for you. Yeah, I mean,

2483
02:11:51,280 --> 02:11:53,390
and so it one of those
where he probably just like,

2484
02:11:53,450 --> 02:11:56,720
it was like okay for him to make it but
be difficult and they just got just a

2485
02:11:56,721 --> 02:11:58,210
little bit too big.
I said,

2486
02:11:58,220 --> 02:12:00,620
was it for world interim
title when he was supposed to,

2487
02:12:00,621 --> 02:12:03,950
I don't think it was the original
time. It was Kevin Lee. Right?

2488
02:12:03,951 --> 02:12:08,020
That was for the world time.
Yeah. Yeah. Or interim title.
Job Title. Yeah. The whole,

2489
02:12:08,030 --> 02:12:09,980
that whole division is kind
of fucked up with Conner.

2490
02:12:09,981 --> 02:12:12,440
Not even knowing whether or not he's
fighting it. They're going to strip him,

2491
02:12:12,441 --> 02:12:16,160
right? Yeah, mostly I think
so. I would imagine. Unless
Connor says, fuck it, I'm in,

2492
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:20,870
I think the best comeback.
Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it.

2493
02:12:20,871 --> 02:12:24,940
I want to keep me belt. I know the best
course of action strip Connor let, let,

2494
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:27,560
could be even Tony fight it out and
then it Kinda of was going back.

2495
02:12:27,561 --> 02:12:30,230
Give him a title shot that's
going to happen. Whatever. Well,

2496
02:12:30,231 --> 02:12:34,520
I think what would be the most
lucrative thing is Connor versus GSD.

2497
02:12:35,410 --> 02:12:38,990
Joe Ought to fight GSP. Oh you
do? I want to be number one.

2498
02:12:38,991 --> 02:12:43,050
I don't want to fight Tyron cause we've
been your friends for 20 years. Uh,

2499
02:12:43,430 --> 02:12:45,260
I wanna fight GSP that
that's who I want to fight.

2500
02:12:45,261 --> 02:12:46,670
Do you think that they would set that up?

2501
02:12:46,671 --> 02:12:50,830
They would try to set up GSP versus
Tyron. Right. That would be super fun.

2502
02:12:50,870 --> 02:12:53,720
GSP doesn't want to fight anyone who can
hit hard because he's worried about the

2503
02:12:53,721 --> 02:12:58,610
brain damage. Yeah. I
don't hit that hard. Right.

2504
02:12:58,850 --> 02:13:01,780
Interesting way of looking at it on
a train with GSP, I've never changed.

2505
02:13:01,781 --> 02:13:06,650
So I've trained with almost every top
what the weight of this era except GSP.

2506
02:13:06,860 --> 02:13:11,360
Really. Yeah. Well GSP
and Rory, but uh, shields,

2507
02:13:11,361 --> 02:13:16,250
Fitch, Diaz, a couple times tire and
obviously, um, you know, go down the line.

2508
02:13:16,251 --> 02:13:17,780
I've trained with pretty
much everyone in this era.

2509
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:22,790
What do you feel like if you do wind up
retiring, what do you feel like you'll,

2510
02:13:22,820 --> 02:13:25,890
you'll wind up doing? Just coach and
coach wrestling. I love doing it.

2511
02:13:26,090 --> 02:13:28,280
Really enjoyed a lot so I could,

2512
02:13:29,230 --> 02:13:32,250
I don't think I'd go back to the
collegiate level. It's obviously

2513
02:13:32,250 --> 02:13:36,090
always an option. It went for the four
years I coach called dress and I loved it,

2514
02:13:36,720 --> 02:13:40,080
you know? And then it was like, Hey, I won
the belt. Hotels making a lot of money.

2515
02:13:40,140 --> 02:13:43,290
I should probably try to be good at
this instead of just doing it halfway,

2516
02:13:43,320 --> 02:13:45,810
you know? Right. And so I
did that and then, you know,

2517
02:13:45,811 --> 02:13:48,390
we opened the wrestling schools
and now it's going a little on it.

2518
02:13:48,450 --> 02:13:52,170
I really enjoyed that a lot. And you
know, there's positives and negatives.

2519
02:13:52,171 --> 02:13:54,360
Like I love coaching at the highest level,

2520
02:13:54,540 --> 02:13:56,820
being able to talk about his
level to the college guys.

2521
02:13:57,300 --> 02:13:59,640
So I missed that part a little bit.

2522
02:14:00,030 --> 02:14:04,020
But then obviously if you go
work for a institution like that,

2523
02:14:04,021 --> 02:14:07,320
there's gonna be a lot of bureaucracy.
And I worry about that. I don't like that.

2524
02:14:07,680 --> 02:14:11,160
I love owning my own business and having
my own freedom and not having to worry

2525
02:14:11,161 --> 02:14:15,030
about what I tweet or what I say or
heaven with telling me what to do or where

2526
02:14:15,031 --> 02:14:17,580
to be or where to dress or whatever.
Like I don't like.

2527
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:19,950
So I love that freedom obviously.

2528
02:14:19,951 --> 02:14:22,530
Then running your own business
has its own challenges also.

2529
02:14:22,830 --> 02:14:26,670
So I think I will coat dress
on for the rest of my life,

2530
02:14:26,830 --> 02:14:29,640
whether I fight once more where
they don't fight once more,

2531
02:14:29,910 --> 02:14:32,130
I'll probably call Jonathan for
the rest of my life. Awesome. Yeah.

2532
02:14:32,190 --> 02:14:35,340
Well listen man, I'm glad we finally got
a chance to do this. It was fun. Really,

2533
02:14:35,341 --> 02:14:38,920
really fun. And um, tell
people about your podcast. Uh,

2534
02:14:38,940 --> 02:14:41,250
so I have a wrestling podcast
called the t Rowe and funky show.

2535
02:14:41,270 --> 02:14:45,650
It's another t Rowe and funky show,
t Rowe and funky shows.

2536
02:14:45,660 --> 02:14:49,530
How do you spell that?
T dash row. Okay. Funky.

2537
02:14:49,531 --> 02:14:51,470
So tire tire.
Uh,

2538
02:14:51,570 --> 02:14:55,720
Tommy Rollins is two time
NCAA champ for Ohio state. Uh,

2539
02:14:55,770 --> 02:14:58,860
made a couple of world teams, was really
close to make an Olympic team. And, um,

2540
02:14:59,490 --> 02:15:02,670
you know, we were just on the phone one
day and he said, I want to do a podcast.

2541
02:15:02,670 --> 02:15:05,220
I'm like, Eh, I want to do a podcast
too. Let's just do one, you know?

2542
02:15:05,221 --> 02:15:08,480
So it's not like a job for us.
We just do it for fun. We enjoy,

2543
02:15:08,500 --> 02:15:12,440
we love talking about wrestling. And you
know, for me it's really nice. Like, uh,

2544
02:15:12,510 --> 02:15:16,210
you know, no one's on the same schedule
as me now that I can talk wrestling with.

2545
02:15:16,211 --> 02:15:19,740
So to be able to get on talk for an
hour a week about wrestling, it's,

2546
02:15:19,760 --> 02:15:24,480
it's a blast. Awesome. So
that's on iTunes and soundcloud.

2547
02:15:24,540 --> 02:15:28,920
People want to find you.
It's Ben Asker on Twitter or Instagram.

2548
02:15:29,460 --> 02:15:32,820
I like, I'm on Instagram, but I don't
really get into it. I don't know.

2549
02:15:32,821 --> 02:15:36,270
I don't know. I can't, I can't get an,
Instagram is just pictures. Like I get it.

2550
02:15:36,300 --> 02:15:39,810
There's no banter back and forth. I
trouble, I post every once in a while.

2551
02:15:39,811 --> 02:15:42,780
But you like Twitter of have Twitter.
Oh, that's fun. Yeah. Ben Aspirin,

2552
02:15:42,781 --> 02:15:45,330
ladies and gentlemen. Thanks brother. I
appreciate it. Yeah, it was fun. Yes sir.

2553
02:15:58,710 --> 02:15:58,790
Okay.
