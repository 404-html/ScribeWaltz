1
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,810
Five,
four,

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,820
three,
two.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,160
Oh,
we jumped the gun.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,630
Hey Amy.
Hey,

5
00:00:10,631 --> 00:00:11,890
good.
Thanks for doing this man.

6
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,660
Appreciate it.
I'm glad to be here.

7
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,940
How's things?
Well,

8
00:00:15,941 --> 00:00:18,340
outside of Vegas.
Everything's good.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,001
I know,
right?

10
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:20,770
You have to say that everybody.
I mean this,

11
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,640
these things that happen that sort of 
just changed the whole world.

12
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:25,893
You gotta think that's probably one of 
the reasons why these psychos do it in 

13
00:00:28,421 --> 00:00:29,260
the first place.
Right?

14
00:00:29,261 --> 00:00:32,940
So that everyone talks about them.
It becomes their,

15
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:33,883
their big fireworks.
Fourth of July grand finale before they 

16
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:38,554
leave.

17
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,453
Yeah.
There was a very interesting post by a 

18
00:00:40,631 --> 00:00:44,500
guy named Robert King on psychology 
today and I guess he's doing research in

19
00:00:44,501 --> 00:00:45,334
this and he talked about it as a way for
men to get or chase status and that he 

20
00:00:53,381 --> 00:00:54,214
saw two bombs.
I think one was at 23 and one at 41 in 

21
00:00:57,131 --> 00:01:02,131
terms of the ages that people do this 
and it does tend to be men who have some

22
00:01:02,351 --> 00:01:05,620
kind of their marriage breaks up,
they lose their job in their forties are

23
00:01:05,621 --> 00:01:08,260
the young men are just chasing status,
so it's,

24
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,573
it's,
it's at least some kind of explanation 

25
00:01:11,861 --> 00:01:12,491
other than,
oh,

26
00:01:12,491 --> 00:01:14,860
someone just went wild.
They just went crazy.

27
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:15,694
Which is not helpful because it doesn't 
tell us really what we can do to maybe 

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,740
prevented or look at how do we look for 
these people who do this?

29
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:24,531
Yeah.
Well,

30
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:26,570
to prevent it,
you have to lock all men up.

31
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,300
Not for that.
That's the only way.

32
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,540
I mean not obviously not the only way,
but it's all men.

33
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,850
That's a giant issue,
right?

34
00:01:34,851 --> 00:01:35,684
I mean it's,
you never see women go on mass 

35
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:37,814
shootings,

36
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,220
but well without men who we'd still be 
living in grass huts,

37
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:41,540
so

38
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,530
listen,
I'm a man.

39
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,383
I'm all pro men,
but it's very weird that it's entirely 

40
00:01:47,511 --> 00:01:48,344
men who do mass shootings and drive 
trucks into crowds and that kind of 

41
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:53,300
thing.

42
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,133
Well,
I think we may start seeing women do 

43
00:01:55,251 --> 00:01:56,084
that,
but actually I don't think it's weird 

44
00:01:57,081 --> 00:02:01,520
that it's men because men,
if you look at how men and women evolved

45
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,060
to get partners,
women just have to look hot.

46
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:09,530
You have to look like you're fertile and
young and have good genes,

47
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,693
which is what we consider beauty.
These what feminists say are arbitrary 

48
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:15,560
standards of beauty or anything like 
that.

49
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,753
They're very across cultures.
Men like women with this hourglass 

50
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:20,264
figure and who have long shiny hair and 
who are not 72 because if you had sex 

51
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:28,490
with a 72 year old,
your genes died out out.

52
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,033
Yeah.
This feminist thing about arbitrary 

53
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:36,580
standards of beauty as a person who is 
deeply entrenched in science,

54
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:38,290
like that's gotta be frustrating,
right?

55
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,780
Because you're looking at something 
that's not accurate.

56
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,110
It's you're pushing a narrative that's 
just not accurate.

57
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:47,030
There's this very takeaway culture 
takeaway.

58
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,063
You know all the,
all your personal feelings about human 

59
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:53,590
beings and you look at the mammal,
the human mammal,

60
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,573
and it's.
It's very clear why the certain males 

61
00:02:57,551 --> 00:02:59,710
are gravitating towards certain and

62
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,053
contrary or conversely why certain 
females or gravitating towards certain 

63
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:07,180
males.
It's biological and this.

64
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,580
It's so unhelpful.
It's really awful.

65
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,210
This idea that people should like you 
for Watson down the inside,

66
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,630
we don't see the people.
If you look at porn,

67
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:19,210
it's not the woman who buys a homeless 
man a sandwich.

68
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,103
You know who in the porn.
It's the woman with those features that 

69
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,380
are just cross culturally appreciated by
men,

70
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,530
but it's also too,
we're talking only about sexual,

71
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,543
right?
Because people do like you for who you 

72
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:32,674
are on the inside.
Like Melissa McCarthy is a perfect 

73
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:36,280
example.
She's as vibrant,

74
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:37,114
hilarious woman and no one's.
No one's holding her up as the standard 

75
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:44,440
of beauty or sexual attractiveness.
You know,

76
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:46,750
you're.
You're looking at her as this fun person

77
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:47,584
and that's why millions of people go see
her in movies and her tv shows is giant 

78
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:51,580
hit mean.

79
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,413
It's literally what's on the inside and 
how she carries herself and she is very 

80
00:03:57,431 --> 00:04:00,250
vibrant and if you look at that cross 
cultural research,

81
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:02,800
David Buss who is an evolutionary 
psychologist,

82
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:03,634
did the big,
big cross cultural study and kindness 

83
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:09,400
was what both men and women wanted.
I think that was the top,

84
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,480
the top of each list.
But if you prioritize,

85
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:14,021
well,
okay,

86
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:16,570
well what do I.
What are my must haves in a partner?

87
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:21,430
A guy is not going to want a very old,
unattractive woman as his partner.

88
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,293
If he can do better and a woman is not 
going to want to have the guy who is 

89
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:28,240
sleeping in grandma's basement playing 
Atari,

90
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,703
Atari or whatever.
I'm a girl so I don't know anything 

91
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:32,644
about football or video games.
My boyfriend tried to educate me on the 

92
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:37,120
way over about some,
I don't know,

93
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,600
some guy who said something insulting to
female sports announcer,

94
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,990
Cam Newton pretty popular quarterback 
said,

95
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,853
uh,
he got a question from a beat reporter 

96
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,630
that works for the his team and ask them
something about our wide receivers route

97
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,503
running.
And he said it's surprising that a girl 

98
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:56,120
is asking about route running or 
something like that,

99
00:04:56,121 --> 00:04:59,270
and he got a lot of shit about it right 
now you've got to drop from a sponsor.

100
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,380
So sort of going on further,
is that all he said,

101
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,980
it's surprising that a girl,
I believe so in then they,

102
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,823
I heard that they went further into it,
off off the record a little bit and he 

103
00:05:09,651 --> 00:05:11,180
was rude,
is what she said.

104
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,300
Oh,
we really expect the football,

105
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,360
the quarterback to be the height of,
you know,

106
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,460
politeness and social etiquette and 
okay,

107
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,380
he shouldn't have said this.
And I think that these,

108
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,570
there are some incredible women who are 
sports announcers.

109
00:05:26,571 --> 00:05:31,190
So I'm told by the boyfriend and I think
it's sexy to be a knowledgeable woman in

110
00:05:31,191 --> 00:05:32,600
sports.
Um,

111
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,870
however we now prosecute everybody for 
everything.

112
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,060
And the reason we do that is there's too
much media.

113
00:05:38,061 --> 00:05:40,610
Everybody's got a microphone.
Everyone's on twitter.

114
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,590
So now this stuff,
that dumb stuff,

115
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:46,190
people would have said another era that 
would have just gone off into the ether.

116
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,710
Now it is just,
it's a new story.

117
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,360
Do you think is that,
is it,

118
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,253
I mean I'm sure it is that,
but isn't it also that we're examining 

119
00:05:53,931 --> 00:05:58,160
behavior on a much more scale

120
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,383
than we've ever done before and we see 
things that we don't like and we're 

121
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,194
highlighting those things in a much more
aggressive way than we've ever done 

122
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:08,714
before.
It's almost like there's accelerating 

123
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:11,984
social evolution that's going on right 
now and along the way you're getting a 

124
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:17,150
lot of bumps and a lot of weird stuff 
that's happening.

125
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:17,984
A lot of social justice warrior stuff 
and then you've got a lot of all right 

126
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,100
stuff on the other side and they're 
battling it out with each other and it's

127
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:25,934
almost like these intense extremes on 
this new landscape and people are 

128
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:34,811
jockeying for positioning on this new 
cultural standard playing field.

129
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,003
Well,
I think what's happened is that now 

130
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:40,940
everyone has a microphone and just so 
everyone's on twitter,

131
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:41,774
everyone can make a tweet that put out a
tweet that gets tweeted and retweeted 

132
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:46,334
two,
4 million people and so people are 

133
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:49,544
looking to have standing and they're 
doing it by putting out their opinions 

134
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:53,294
and they also.
When you're saying this about these 

135
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:56,210
tribes,
they do it to signal,

136
00:06:56,211 --> 00:06:57,560
look,
I'm part of this tribe.

137
00:06:57,561 --> 00:07:00,080
I'm a social justice warrior.
I'm on the right.

138
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,160
I'm Antifa.
And so I think that that's a big part of

139
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:04,994
it.
So they're looking for criminal 

140
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,920
behavior,
socially criminal behavior and whereas,

141
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,480
you know this guy,
I mean,

142
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:15,140
do I really expect every quarterback to 
have the most pc views?

143
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,340
No.
And okay,

144
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:19,100
he's gonna lose his sponsorship when he 
says something like this,

145
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:22,700
but you know,
if you open the quarterback can,

146
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:25,360
you're going to see quarterback stuff in
there and it's not,

147
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,380
you know,
emily post,

148
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,600
well first of all with quarterbacks and 
with any football players,

149
00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:31,434
you're dealing with head trauma,
you are 100 percent dealing with head 

150
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:34,854
trauma.
There is an extremely high likelihood 

151
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,020
that all those guys on the playing field
or have erratic behavior due to the fact

152
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:42,863
they're head's been smashed a 150 
fucking times a year since they were a 

153
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:47,310
kid.
And that is just a fact.

154
00:07:47,311 --> 00:07:48,450
There's no getting around that.

155
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,501
Yeah,
and I actually,

156
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:50,334
I really appreciate that.
We're starting to see people look at 

157
00:07:51,691 --> 00:07:54,400
that and bring that out so parents know,
you know,

158
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,990
do you want your son to play football or
to play some other sport?

159
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,120
Yeah,
I mean look,

160
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:00,973
I have kids and I wouldn't want my kids 
to fight even though I'm a commentator 

161
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:05,324
and fighting.
Right.

162
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,920
I just think like,
God,

163
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:08,840
if you really want to do it,
I mean I'm,

164
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,240
I'll support them in anything they 
really want to do,

165
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,103
but I would tell them,
but it's just the upside and the 

166
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,660
downside.
Like if you can get out,

167
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,000
like some guys get out like floyd 
mayweather.

168
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:25,060
I mean he's just a brilliant tactician 
and a incredibly good defensively and he

169
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:26,144
got out relatively unscathed,
but you really won't know how unscathed 

170
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:30,164
until 10,
15 years from now when you see them 

171
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:32,770
struggling with his words.
Right,

172
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,730
right.
It's just not worth it.

173
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,980
Life is.
Life is short,

174
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,480
but it's long if you're fucked up.
Absolutely.

175
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,313
And you see that from these guys.
I read some story about that the other 

176
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:45,820
day.
I'm trying to think who is the guy so,

177
00:08:45,821 --> 00:08:46,654
so sad and this thing about it showing 
up much later where you get terribly 

178
00:08:49,391 --> 00:08:51,310
mental,
mentally ill people.

179
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,170
They make those tradeoffs where they 
think,

180
00:08:53,171 --> 00:08:54,004
okay,
well I can get money and fame way and 

181
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:56,070
it's quick

182
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,903
and everything like that,
but they don't really realize what the 

183
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:01,230
longterm consequences will be.

184
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,553
Well,
I think a lot of people in the got into 

185
00:09:03,401 --> 00:09:05,620
football and even people that got into 
fighting,

186
00:09:05,621 --> 00:09:06,454
they didn't.
They didn't know as much back then when 

187
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:12,010
they first entered this sort of journey.
Especially football.

188
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:15,790
I mean football being we really.
There was no conversation about that.

189
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,960
Think about like the Oj trial,
you know,

190
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,893
I've been kind of on the Oj kick lately 
because I started watching that Cuba 

191
00:09:21,641 --> 00:09:26,380
gooding jr series where they sort of 
reenact and it's really kind of freaking

192
00:09:26,381 --> 00:09:29,930
me out because bringing back the 
memories of the nineties and what,

193
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,910
what it was like when that,
when that thing went down,

194
00:09:33,911 --> 00:09:34,744
I was with my girlfriend at the time and
we were sitting in front of the 

195
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:41,590
television holding hands and you know,
like waiting for the verdict and when,

196
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,310
when they said not guilty,
she threw her hands on her face.

197
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,800
Like she had just seen a horrible car 
accident.

198
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:48,790
She was like,
oh my God.

199
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,140
Oh my God.
She kept shooting.

200
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,590
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

201
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,720
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

202
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,393
And

203
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,000
now today they're saying the,
the,

204
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,300
the,
the very doctor that was working with Oj

205
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,950
said if they were going to do that case 
again today,

206
00:10:02,951 --> 00:10:04,340
they would absolutely bring up.
See?

207
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,100
Yeah.
I think you're right about that.

208
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,860
Absolutely.
And there's so many football players who

209
00:10:09,861 --> 00:10:12,620
got in just not knowing who will come 
out like that.

210
00:10:12,621 --> 00:10:15,040
I think within a number of years,
yeah,

211
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,420
that was only 20 years ago,
23 years ago,

212
00:10:17,421 --> 00:10:19,490
whatever it was.
That's not that long ago,

213
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,660
so 23 years ago nobody thought about 
brain trauma came to facebook,

214
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,150
which is just nuts.

215
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,723
Well now these guys are debilitated.
There's a whole bunch of different 

216
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:30,344
lawsuits that are going on right now 
with the NFL and you're seeing these 

217
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,133
older players.
I mean they have on real sports at 

218
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:35,084
Bryant Gumbel and they're sitting there 
and they're shaking and they can't 

219
00:10:37,281 --> 00:10:39,130
control themselves and you're like,
wow,

220
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,940
well this is,
this is on

221
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,910
unheard of 20 years ago,
30 years ago,

222
00:10:42,911 --> 00:10:45,340
we never thought of this.
This was never in the public discourse.

223
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,620
Yeah,
and I suspect if you go back and look at

224
00:10:47,621 --> 00:10:48,454
those tapes sort of forensically that 
you'll see that kind of thing just 

225
00:10:50,991 --> 00:10:51,824
shaking and,
and also that if you look at to take a 

226
00:10:54,251 --> 00:10:57,750
look at over football players,
how many people have these,

227
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,750
these diseases and mental illness that's
related to this head trauma?

228
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:02,420
Yeah,

229
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,253
I'm sure quite a bit,
but mean this football player guy that 

230
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:06,950
we're talking about,
Cam Newton.

231
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,860
You know what,
the only thing that's wrong with.

232
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,330
I mean it's not even wrong.
I mean he's trying to get sponsors.

233
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:16,380
That's the whole deal.
Yeah,

234
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:19,680
and if you're whatever Coca Cola or 
whatever the company is,

235
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:22,770
you don't want someone representing you 
that does something like that.

236
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,620
No.
And so it's sort of normal.

237
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,930
Yeah,
well it's normal that they say,

238
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,853
okay,
we're dumping you and it's normal that 

239
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:32,610
he would say it,
but what's always funny is that these,

240
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,580
these companies,
they profess surprise when it's like,

241
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,443
really?
You thought that this person was going 

242
00:11:38,371 --> 00:11:41,850
to be the sort of curtailed reigned in 
person.

243
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:43,740
It's like with Kathy Griffin.
Oh,

244
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,633
you just figured out that she says 
events of things that was a surprise to 

245
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:49,620
you?
Well it wasn't.

246
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,500
I mean with,
with her was just so poorly thought out.

247
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:53,530
It's like,
what do you,

248
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,070
what is

249
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,903
the message there?
You're holding a bloody head like Jesus 

250
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,930
Christ.
Like when we.

251
00:11:58,970 --> 00:11:59,803
I mean,
if you want to hold up the bloody head 

252
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:05,170
of some murderous dictator who's killed 
a bunch of people,

253
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:08,020
then I kind of understand.
But even then like what,

254
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,670
what is,
are you isis?

255
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:10,690
Like,
what's this message?

256
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:11,441
Right.
Well,

257
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:13,500
I think she didn't think it out and it 
was just okay,

258
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,040
outrage,
trying to be shocking,

259
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:15,903
trying to be shocking.
And then the sort of fake apology and 

260
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,300
then okay,
take it back.

261
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,660
It's the fake apology.
And then it was like a,

262
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,890
he's a bullying and he broke me.
And like,

263
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,140
like playing the victim card.

264
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,890
Yeah,
you're a comedian,

265
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,770
you know,
and I know comedians have like that.

266
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:31,643
Then you know what someone's going to 
heckle you on and so you have stuff 

267
00:12:33,411 --> 00:12:34,244
ready for that.
And this thing like where she's all 

268
00:12:35,571 --> 00:12:36,200
like,

269
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,930
for me,
my career is over.

270
00:12:38,931 --> 00:12:41,060
I don't have a career now is like,
oh all right,

271
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,760
just take a couple months off.
You'll be fun.

272
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:44,240
Yeah.
Right.

273
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,180
People forget there's some new outrage.
Well there's always going to be.

274
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,073
It's always has some new crazy fucking 
thing and it was also going to be a 

275
00:12:50,151 --> 00:12:52,130
bunch of people that are probably 
excited that you did that too.

276
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,493
They'll calm down after a while.
It won't be in the news anymore and 

277
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,033
yeah,
it's just we live in a time where 

278
00:12:58,401 --> 00:13:00,890
everything is hyper examined.

279
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,460
Yeah,
it is,

280
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,363
and so that standard and that's why I 
think we have to be more lenient with 

281
00:13:06,271 --> 00:13:07,104
people.
This idea that you say something awful 

282
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:11,100
and then you're excommunicated.
You lose your job.

283
00:13:11,101 --> 00:13:13,770
You're going to be living in a dumpster.
This is really wrong.

284
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:16,740
We need to understand that to be human 
is to be an asshole.

285
00:13:16,741 --> 00:13:20,550
We're all assholes.
We all say shitty things to people and I

286
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:21,384
try to recognize my assholeishness and 
apologize when I've been awful and make 

287
00:13:25,621 --> 00:13:26,454
good.
If sometimes you have to put some money 

288
00:13:27,481 --> 00:13:28,550
into making good.
It's.

289
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:31,190
It's what the situation calls for 
William.

290
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:31,831
No,
right.

291
00:13:31,831 --> 00:13:32,664
Look,
especially when you run into someone in 

292
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:34,114
traffic and they're screaming at someone
and giving them the finger like you 

293
00:13:35,891 --> 00:13:38,380
don't know what that poor person has 
been through that day.

294
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,260
Like obviously they're there.
They're at nine,

295
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,220
they didn't start at one when they were 
in that traffic incident.

296
00:13:45,221 --> 00:13:47,680
They're probably at nine already and 
then this Saben

297
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,280
motherfucker.
That's where they're coming from.

298
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,630
Raw nerve.
Yeah.

299
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,660
And so it really is important.
People see it as a sign of weakness,

300
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:57,850
but it's actually a sign of strength to 
say,

301
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,420
I'm ashamed I did this bad thing.
I did this recently.

302
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,620
I shouted on the phone,
very bad to this.

303
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:07,130
Some really nice person at the Kaiser 
Pharmacy just because you know,

304
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,840
she should magically solve my problem.
It wasn't a problem she could solve,

305
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,760
but after I did that I thought like,
oh,

306
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:13,990
this is so terrible.
Number one,

307
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:15,130
I talked to her.
She's kind,

308
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:16,540
she didn't deserve this.
So I actually,

309
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,460
I went in and I asked for her and I 
said,

310
00:14:18,461 --> 00:14:20,550
I'm so ashamed.
I spoke to you terribly.

311
00:14:20,551 --> 00:14:22,960
You didn't deserve this.
You're very kind to date and purpose.

312
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,700
Uh,
excuse me in person,

313
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:25,883
in person because well,
I was going there anyway to pick up my 

314
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:29,380
medication.
So it was easier.

315
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:30,214
But I actually asked to speak to her 
because I think it means something to 

316
00:14:33,161 --> 00:14:36,070
people.
When you do that thing where you say you

317
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,750
put your ego aside and say,
look,

318
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,584
I was bad and I was wrong.
People appreciate that you're doing 

319
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:42,364
that.
It gives them something back and it 

320
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:47,140
steals from people to just do something 
and then think,

321
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,990
ha ha,
I got away with it because you didn't.

322
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,070
You know it and actually they know

323
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,530
it and they feel bad and I don't like to
make people feel bad.

324
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,573
Well also you feel less about yourself 
and I think that's as important as 

325
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:01,490
anything like one of the things about,
unless you're a sociopath,

326
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:06,730
when you do something mean to someone,
you feel bad about yourself,

327
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:07,604
you don't judge yourself the same way.
You look at yourself and your own 

328
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,690
behavior and you go,
wow,

329
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:12,620
I'm,
I'm faulty.

330
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:13,760
I'm like,
I don't.

331
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,450
I'm not proud of that.
That's awful.

332
00:15:15,451 --> 00:15:16,284
Like what I did was a bad thing.
I feel bad about who I am and if you 

333
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:20,894
just deny that you're just building up 
this weird wall of disconnect between 

334
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:26,144
you and reality and you're going to make
more and more shitty choices if you do 

335
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:31,370
that and you are.
I,

336
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:32,204
I think that you are the sum total of 
your behavior so you can feel all sorts 

337
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:35,924
of ways.

338
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:40,130
You can fail wimpy and afraid and feel 
like you don't want to apologize,

339
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,370
but if you behave the good way,
the better way,

340
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:45,920
the way you want to be,
then you're that person.

341
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,840
It doesn't matter what your feelings 
are.

342
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,703
Well,
this is one of the main issues that I 

343
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:50,474
have today with this right versus left 
social justice warrior thing that's 

344
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:55,574
going on,
like people are being so fucking 

345
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:58,663
aggressive and so rude and so just the 
way they are trying to silence people 

346
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:05,924
from speaking,
the way they're describing people and 

347
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:09,470
attacking people.
It's a.

348
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:10,523
it's a very aggressive way and it's very
short sided because when you have that 

349
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:14,924
sort of short sided aggressive,
what's you're doing is like you're 

350
00:16:17,871 --> 00:16:19,730
yelling,
shut the fuck up.

351
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,601
Well,
when you yelled,

352
00:16:20,601 --> 00:16:22,880
shut the fuck up.
Nobody wants to shut the fuck up.

353
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:23,960
They don't just go,
oh,

354
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:24,670
okay.

355
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,503
Like you're,
you're.

356
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,380
This is a childish way of approaching an
issue like the,

357
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,810
the,
the more objective nuanced,

358
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,703
more thought out way of approaching it 
is to take into consideration how this 

359
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:40,310
other person is going to view what 
you're saying.

360
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,433
Like the only way to get people to 
change is to present them and art or 

361
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,960
some sort of an argument or some sort of
a,

362
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:53,080
an idea that is both polite and well 
thought out and,

363
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,650
and there's no social issue involved in 
it.

364
00:16:57,651 --> 00:16:58,484
Like there's no negative back and forth 
between you where you're trying to get 

365
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:03,164
them and they're trying to get you.
The only way to get someone to really 

366
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:10,590
take into consideration your ideas is to
have them in some way respect your,

367
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,740
like you.
And as soon as you tell someone,

368
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:13,910
shut the fuck up.
Like,

369
00:17:13,911 --> 00:17:14,744
well,
that's out.

370
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:15,980
Okay,
well that's out,

371
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:16,843
and now it's just like you're just going
to win by having more people yell or 

372
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:20,240
what are you going to do?

373
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,570
You're gonna put a ski mask on and break
windows like,

374
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,020
is that how you're going to get this 
done?

375
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,063
You're not.
You're just going to cause an action 

376
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:28,034
reaction,
you're just going to cause this sort of 

377
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:29,954
rubber band effect.
We pull it back and then it snaps and 

378
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:32,924
then you've got some sort of ridiculous 
infighting where people go full tribal 

379
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:37,603
and they get one side goes against the 
other side and this is what you're 

380
00:17:39,951 --> 00:17:40,784
seeing today and,
and you're seeing people do it to get 

381
00:17:43,101 --> 00:17:43,934
attention as well.
You're seeing people do it clearly when 

382
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:46,634
they know the cameras are on,
they ramp it up and starts yelling 

383
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:50,250
obscenities

384
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,520
and being more ridiculous about it and 
it's very odd.

385
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,760
It's very odd to watch it play out,
you know,

386
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,790
so short sided.
Yeah,

387
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,940
they practically wait.
Okay.

388
00:17:58,941 --> 00:18:00,620
Are you rolling?
Three,

389
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,311
two,
one.

390
00:18:01,311 --> 00:18:02,720
Okay.
Smash the window.

391
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,073
You know what you said reminded me the 
worst thing a man can say to a woman is 

392
00:18:06,801 --> 00:18:09,920
calmed down.
It always has the opposite effect.

393
00:18:09,921 --> 00:18:10,754
At cop once said that to me,
I called the local police station about 

394
00:18:12,711 --> 00:18:13,820
some problem.
The Guy told me,

395
00:18:13,821 --> 00:18:14,660
calm down.
I'm like,

396
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,780
does that work on your girlfriend?
Because it's not working on me.

397
00:18:17,781 --> 00:18:19,700
It never works in any woman's.
So here's a tip,

398
00:18:19,701 --> 00:18:20,534
dude,
what doesn't work on men either doesn't 

399
00:18:21,741 --> 00:18:23,660
work on anybody,
maybe it works on kids,

400
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,840
not just kids and work on anyone.
I tell my kids to calm down.

401
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:31,640
The opposite effect,
always shut off for any of these things.

402
00:18:31,641 --> 00:18:34,280
He's rude approaches and so the thing 
is,

403
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:35,114
when you get somebody,
what you do is you provoke somebody 

404
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,100
defensiveness.

405
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:37,933
It's a fight or flight reaction.
You know this happens to us on an 

406
00:18:40,371 --> 00:18:41,204
emotional plane as well,
and so you're provoking that whole 

407
00:18:43,911 --> 00:18:44,744
reaction that's designed to make you get
away from a bear or some type of wild 

408
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:49,754
animal.
But instead of writing and burning off 

409
00:18:51,411 --> 00:18:54,560
all those biochemicals,
it's all pooling in you.

410
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,673
You're filling with hate and rage.
So this is not a state in which you can 

411
00:18:59,061 --> 00:18:59,894
listen to anyone and so the moment you 
take it up to that area of invoking 

412
00:19:04,281 --> 00:19:07,460
somebody hate and defense and rage and 
all that stuff,

413
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,680
they are,
they're so far away from listening,

414
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:12,710
you might as well just crawl under the 
desk and go read a novel.

415
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,530
It's just so pointless to even engage 
with them.

416
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:19,970
And so the people who do want to engage,
if you engage on a pole light level,

417
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,200
maybe possibly if someone is just not 
totally reeled in by confirmation bias,

418
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,090
they might listen and confirmation bias 
of course is that thing where we believe

419
00:19:29,091 --> 00:19:33,080
what we already believe and when we 
throw away any disconfirming evidence.

420
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,340
And so you know,
if you recognize these propensities,

421
00:19:37,341 --> 00:19:40,340
we have to do that to believe what we 
believe,

422
00:19:40,341 --> 00:19:42,200
to be tribal,
to stick to this side,

423
00:19:42,201 --> 00:19:44,330
to not listened to,
not change our views.

424
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,433
The maybe have a hope of changing your 
views and maybe if you try to listen to 

425
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:51,570
other people who,
you know,

426
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:52,723
there are differing views who are polite
and trying to engage on a rational 

427
00:19:55,911 --> 00:19:57,530
level.
You can learn something.

428
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,410
I try to be open minded.
I try to take criticism.

429
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,423
I try to not rejected out of hand.
Of course I don't take the criticism 

430
00:20:03,321 --> 00:20:05,840
that comes from dear bitch,
you ugly whore.

431
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,760
Like to get those.
Yeah.

432
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,010
But I always think like,
just drop the deer.

433
00:20:10,011 --> 00:20:13,240
If you're going to start with bitch,
you ugly whore.

434
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,010
The humor comes in,
comes in when they're being polite,

435
00:20:16,011 --> 00:20:16,970
whether criticize it.
Yeah.

436
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,170
I love that.
I love that.

437
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,670
It's so funny.
Well,

438
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,230
people,

439
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,570
when they get in arguments,
it becomes a competition,

440
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,613
you know,
and that's,

441
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,270
that's a big part of the whole insult 
thing in the part,

442
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,193
just shouting down thing.
It's like you're trying to win and 

443
00:20:29,441 --> 00:20:31,990
you're trying to win an argument that 
very few people ever.

444
00:20:31,991 --> 00:20:32,920
When,
I mean it's,

445
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:33,754
it's,
it's,

446
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:37,240
it's usually like both people walk away 
just disgusted with a loss,

447
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,263
you know,
it's very rare that unless someone is 

448
00:20:39,971 --> 00:20:40,804
egregious,
Lee incorrect and you literally have to 

449
00:20:43,091 --> 00:20:43,924
shout them down because what they're 
doing is horrific and you need to point 

450
00:20:46,001 --> 00:20:48,100
it out to them,
but usually not the case.

451
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,930
Well,
usually it's disagreement,

452
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,250
you know,
most of the time.

453
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,663
Right.
And these people think they're so 

454
00:20:53,511 --> 00:20:55,910
convinced it's religion.
They think that they're right.

455
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,440
We are on the left,
we're right,

456
00:20:57,441 --> 00:20:58,274
we're on the right,
were right and they are just unwilling 

457
00:21:00,531 --> 00:21:01,760
to listen.
It's cartoonish.

458
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:06,020
Now I saw something the other day about 
this great girl at Bernard,

459
00:21:06,021 --> 00:21:09,270
Tony Braxton,
and she's this young journalist student.

460
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:14,180
Tony around accidents a I r e e k.
anyway,

461
00:21:14,181 --> 00:21:15,014
I can see what a strange name.
I know she's from Ohio and from a poor 

462
00:21:19,131 --> 00:21:22,820
family and got a scholarship to Bernard 
and you see how hard she works.

463
00:21:22,821 --> 00:21:23,654
She's a journalist and she looks to see 
different sides of things and I really 

464
00:21:28,131 --> 00:21:30,950
respect that in her because you don't 
see that in a lot of people that age.

465
00:21:30,951 --> 00:21:34,280
There's just such polarization.
I forget why I was bringing her up.

466
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,061
It's this thing.
Oh,

467
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:37,370
I know she posted something so she wrote
an article.

468
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,331
They have,
you know,

469
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:40,250
Columbia Republicans who are,
you know,

470
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,870
who knows?
What do they want to bring in?

471
00:21:41,871 --> 00:21:42,704
Like Ben Shapiro.
I love the idea that anyone would be 

472
00:21:44,271 --> 00:21:46,820
afraid of Ben Shapiro behind me on the 
street.

473
00:21:46,821 --> 00:21:47,780
I'd be like,
oh great.

474
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,310
Fantastic.
Dark Alley.

475
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,690
Ben Shapiro.
No problem.

476
00:21:50,691 --> 00:21:53,990
Sorry Ben.
But who's a nice guy?

477
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,180
I don't know him,
but he seems fine.

478
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:57,890
You know,
we're a little Yamaka and everything.

479
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,780
I'm post Jewish so I can make Jewish 
jokes Jewish.

480
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,070
So I draped it.
Yes.

481
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,063
I'm an escape Jew and so they.
Somebody posted something about being 

482
00:22:09,741 --> 00:22:10,574
against white supremacists and it was 
really about like they're going to have 

483
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,510
a Republican speaker,
you know,

484
00:22:14,511 --> 00:22:17,000
and there was so ugly about Republicans 
and I thought,

485
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:18,620
God,
have you ever talked to one?

486
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:21,470
My parents are Republicans.
My friend Tom,

487
00:22:21,471 --> 00:22:22,304
who this Christian lawyer I know,
he feeds the homeless because he thinks 

488
00:22:24,681 --> 00:22:26,180
that split.
Jesus said you should do.

489
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:30,410
These are not horrible people who are 
burning crosses in lawns.

490
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,830
They're your next door neighbor 
depending on where you live,

491
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,350
grows

492
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,390
generalization.
That doesn't do anyone any good,

493
00:22:35,391 --> 00:22:38,000
especially when you're talking about 
someone like Ben Shapiro.

494
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,030
Ben is a very well read,
very well thought out,

495
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,640
very reasonable,
and when you talk to him in person,

496
00:22:43,641 --> 00:22:45,830
he's a very kind guy.
There's nothing wrong with him.

497
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,600
He's just conservative,
you know,

498
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:48,434
and whether I agree or disagree and I'm 
sure I disagree with him on a lot of 

499
00:22:50,931 --> 00:22:51,764
things.
I had a really pleasant time talking to 

500
00:22:53,031 --> 00:22:54,440
him.
I think he's a very nice guy.

501
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:58,600
His ideas and his,
his.

502
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,750
The way he speaks is very well thought 
out.

503
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,840
He speaks very quickly and it's 
intimidating to a lot of people,

504
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,853
his ideas and the the,
the idea that he is this extremely 

505
00:23:09,861 --> 00:23:10,694
articulate right wing guy immediately.
The best way to silence that is white 

506
00:23:15,411 --> 00:23:17,510
supremacy.
Kay Kay Kay.

507
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,553
He's a Nazi.
I've seen people call Ben Shapiro and 

508
00:23:21,321 --> 00:23:23,160
Nazi.
He wears a fucking Yama.

509
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,340
I know he's an Orthodox Jew,

510
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,680
right?
It's hilarious.

511
00:23:26,681 --> 00:23:29,860
So amazing.
It's so amazing and that kind of thing.

512
00:23:29,861 --> 00:23:32,500
We see it on both sides and there was 
something the other day,

513
00:23:32,501 --> 00:23:36,790
so Dana Loesch,
she's a commentator and she's apparently

514
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,773
very pro nra,
so people send her just the ugliest 

515
00:23:41,351 --> 00:23:44,260
tweets and I'm sure I disagree with her 
on a number of things.

516
00:23:44,261 --> 00:23:45,590
They don't really look at her views

517
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,190
extensively,
but they were things like,

518
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,053
you know,
I hope you die in a hail of gunfire or 

519
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:52,820
something like that.
Along those lines,

520
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:55,190
outside the NRA headquarters,
but I love this one.

521
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,320
The Guy said,
dear God,

522
00:23:57,321 --> 00:23:58,640
and he spelled God,
g,

523
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,503
Dash d,
we really are going to pussy foot onto 

524
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:07,340
the oh and in God on the vowels.
Like I love that.

525
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,730
That's like extreme left people that 
won't even acknowledged the existence of

526
00:24:10,731 --> 00:24:12,410
God.
So even as they write it,

527
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,273
they put a,
like an Asterick I think he might've 

528
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:17,030
been a religious guy or something,
you know,

529
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:17,680
maybe.
So,

530
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,520
I mean,
I write books with fucking the title and

531
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:21,290
I always want them to write the full 
fuck,

532
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,213
but it's just,
it was like enough to get the fuck in 

533
00:24:24,021 --> 00:24:24,854
there with the asterisk and everything.
Funny that we're afraid of words like 

534
00:24:27,701 --> 00:24:28,131
that.
Like,

535
00:24:28,131 --> 00:24:29,180
oh my God,
like,

536
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,073
what do you,
what do you think you're confusing 

537
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:32,870
someone with like,
oh,

538
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:33,681
they actually meant,
oh,

539
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,010
Petunia,
you know,

540
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,980
asterisk makes it all.

541
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,730
Okay.
So there are people,

542
00:24:39,731 --> 00:24:41,780
and my favorite ones,
some people reviewed one of my books.

543
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:44,450
They would say like,
this book is filled with profanity.

544
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:48,680
It has fuck on the,
what was your first fucking clue?

545
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,710
Yeah,
it's a really,

546
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,750
really weird with that kind of stuff.
It's just,

547
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,000
you know,
what,

548
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,530
what they get upset about.
Um,

549
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,830
I know Dana,
I've met her.

550
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,090
She's very nice.
You know,

551
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,600
I've been on our show once,
right after that,

552
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:04,450
Cecil,
the lion thing happened and brighter.

553
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,890
Vaguely remember that she's,
uh,

554
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,820
she's,
she's like a,

555
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,170
a right wing woman.
I'm pretty sure she started at her life.

556
00:25:12,171 --> 00:25:16,160
I think she was very left wing and one 
point in time and saw a lot of hypocrisy

557
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:17,810
in the left and switched over to the 
right.

558
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,360
But again,
it's like we were talking about before,

559
00:25:20,361 --> 00:25:21,780
she's very tribal,
you know,

560
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,633
she's nra tribal,
pro gun second amendment and they dig 

561
00:25:25,161 --> 00:25:26,930
their heels in and that's it.

562
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:27,970
You know,
bumps.

563
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:30,410
I want the bump stocks,
I want the fucking full auto.

564
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,560
I want magazines,
big magazines.

565
00:25:33,561 --> 00:25:36,200
Like no matter what happens and I think 
you know,

566
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,610
to be,
I call myself a neither.

567
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:40,580
I'm neither a Democrat or Republican.
I'm libertarian,

568
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:44,210
fiscally conservative.
And I think that helps me identifying as

569
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:45,044
sort of a.
nothing helps me to not succumb to so 

570
00:25:48,891 --> 00:25:50,140
much of that.
You know,

571
00:25:50,141 --> 00:25:50,974
I of course being human,
I do have views and I tend to stick to 

572
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,080
them,
but I try to be open.

573
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,640
Well,
when you go nra though,

574
00:25:58,670 --> 00:25:59,503
I mean this is the thing is like if 
you're like a very outspoken nra person 

575
00:26:02,491 --> 00:26:06,560
and she was famously involved in one of 
those really aggressive videos about the

576
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:07,880
NRA.
Just see that video that was,

577
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,613
it was like a sort of like,
it was really recently very 

578
00:26:13,551 --> 00:26:17,560
controversial video talking about gun 
ownership and there's,

579
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,573
it was like a sort of pro nra video that
was like widely criticized on the left 

580
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,433
and I think the,
I know the subject of gun ownership and 

581
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:31,100
just what happens to these mass 
tragedies.

582
00:26:31,101 --> 00:26:31,934
I mean it is,
it is a conversation that stirs up 

583
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,740
tribalism logic.
It's,

584
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,110
it's a very complex,
very.

585
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:39,944
And also mental health issues.
I mean I want to know what was going on 

586
00:26:42,741 --> 00:26:43,820
with this.
I want to know

587
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,993
this Vegas Guy,
was he on some sort of psych meds 

588
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,633
because a giant percentage of these 
people are and what's the ramifications 

589
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:55,350
of that and why?
What is causing this fucked up behavior?

590
00:26:55,351 --> 00:26:56,880
Is it simply,
you know,

591
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:57,743
what people love to call toxic 
masculinity manifesting itself in the 

592
00:27:00,511 --> 00:27:03,360
most horrific form?
Or is there some other factors?

593
00:27:03,361 --> 00:27:04,194
I mean,
these disassociative psych meds that 

594
00:27:06,331 --> 00:27:07,164
they put these people on that allow them
to just deal with life in a way where 

595
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:12,240
they just don't feel,
you know?

596
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,830
I mean,
have you ever been on psych meds?

597
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,580
Yeah,
I took Zoloft ones and.

598
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,820
Oh,
and I forgot.

599
00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:20,880
I take adderall every day.
You're pilled up.

600
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,773
Fuck.
It's great.

601
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,090
I'm not on it now because I would talk 
so fast.

602
00:27:24,091 --> 00:27:24,924
I might hurt people with my speech.
So a lot of people in here that are on 

603
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,930
adderall because they feel like when 
they do a podcast they need to be ramped

604
00:27:30,931 --> 00:27:31,680
up to keep up.

605
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,470
And Jesus,
it's so obvious.

606
00:27:33,471 --> 00:27:35,100
You're like slow.
I want to get them drinks.

607
00:27:35,101 --> 00:27:36,480
And sometimes I offer them drinks.
I'm like,

608
00:27:36,481 --> 00:27:38,010
let's,
let's have a drink.

609
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:38,943
I know.
I know better even though it slows me 

610
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,124
down and I'm on the same dose at seven 
point five milligrams and the total 

611
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:45,420
lightweight of lightweights.
But um,

612
00:27:45,421 --> 00:27:49,710
so the Zoloft I took because I went to a
psychiatrist in New York and you know,

613
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:50,544
date,
they actually tried to give me like 

614
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:54,210
lithium and all these other things like 
for manic depressive people.

615
00:27:54,211 --> 00:27:55,044
My friends said you're manic depressive.
And basically it's so crazy because all 

616
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,600
I was,
it wasn't some kind of inexplicable,

617
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,680
horrible depression.
I didn't have a boyfriend.

618
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:08,400
I didn't have any money and I was bombed
and I took us all off.

619
00:28:08,401 --> 00:28:10,830
Then I realized that just shaved off 
half of my personality.

620
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:13,470
So I did the really dumb thing you're 
not supposed to do,

621
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:15,480
which is just I thought like fuck this 
shit,

622
00:28:15,481 --> 00:28:16,470
flushed it down the toilet.

623
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:20,310
And then I fell off a cliff emotionally.
I think that was a bad idea.

624
00:28:20,311 --> 00:28:24,440
Not only that,
what'd you do those poor fish river?

625
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,790
My follow this bodies.
Yeah.

626
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,480
Well they said that there's like Lotus a
bowl,

627
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,343
like trace elements.
Like you could actually measure trace 

628
00:28:34,471 --> 00:28:37,710
elements and some water supplies of,
of antidepressants probably.

629
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:42,720
Sorry everybody water.
But isn't that funny that,

630
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,554
that saying that like I've talked to 
people that are extremely defensive 

631
00:28:47,371 --> 00:28:51,420
about their use of antidepressants and 
when you bring in,

632
00:28:51,421 --> 00:28:52,254
anybody discusses,
especially someone like you who has 

633
00:28:54,211 --> 00:28:55,044
tried them and is open about like,
what was the cause here I was bummed 

634
00:28:59,011 --> 00:28:59,910
out.
I didn't have a boyfriend.

635
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:04,350
Like if you say that to people they love
to,

636
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:09,760
to generalize depression as a disease,
it is a disease,

637
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:14,100
there is a mental issue and no,
no exercise,

638
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,860
diet,
change of lifestyle,

639
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,450
you know,
love in your life,

640
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,343
none of that's going to fix it.
Having a career that's really 

641
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:22,380
fulfilling,
none of that was going to fix it.

642
00:29:22,381 --> 00:29:26,010
I have a disease and I need medicine for
my disease.

643
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,090
See,
that's such a.

644
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,830
just a sort of wary one note idea.
And I love the research of this guy,

645
00:29:31,831 --> 00:29:33,180
Randy Nessie.
I love him.

646
00:29:33,181 --> 00:29:37,360
He's a psychiatrist and an evolutionary 
psychologist and he talks about how,

647
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:40,950
I suppose it's any sse and you can go on
his website.

648
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,310
He's now at University of Arizona

649
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,960
because he was in Michigan's freezing 
there.

650
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,940
Everybody out eventually moved to 
Arizona.

651
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:47,770
All these professors.
Anyway,

652
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,460
um,
so he talks about how depression,

653
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,160
um,
you know,

654
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,080
the sad feelings,
these are adaptive and so when something

655
00:29:56,081 --> 00:29:59,980
bad happens to you,
being sad causes you to slow down,

656
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,143
you have the features of a sad person 
which has causes other people to gather 

657
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:07,660
around you and be empathetic.
And if it goes on for too long,

658
00:30:07,661 --> 00:30:08,494
you may chase people away.
But this allows you to think about what 

659
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:15,250
dumb fucking thing you did that made you
get in the state.

660
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:18,070
And I talk about how emotions are 
motivational tools.

661
00:30:18,071 --> 00:30:18,904
We think of them as sort of like 
wallpaper for our head to decorate our 

662
00:30:20,891 --> 00:30:21,724
life,
but they're not emotions when you're 

663
00:30:22,991 --> 00:30:26,240
happy that says do more of that when 
you're depressed.

664
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,180
I stopped doing that,
reflect on it.

665
00:30:28,181 --> 00:30:30,490
And so there are different kinds of 
depression.

666
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,323
There's a kind that is this medical 
depression that's inexplicable and that 

667
00:30:35,531 --> 00:30:39,730
maybe drugs are needed for.
But often I think that doctors,

668
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,020
psychiatrists,
um,

669
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:41,923
my experience was in my experience 
listening to other people because I 

670
00:30:44,771 --> 00:30:46,990
write this advice column and I get 
letters from everybody.

671
00:30:46,991 --> 00:30:49,480
And I've been doing this for a long time
since the early nineties,

672
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,840
is that doctors just say here's a pill,
and a lot of these antidepressants,

673
00:30:55,211 --> 00:30:56,044
they've been shown that they don't 
really work and so maybe it's a placebo 

674
00:30:59,381 --> 00:31:00,850
effect,
which actually is a thing,

675
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,673
but a lot of times it's people are 
medicating away this helpful part of 

676
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:10,114
depression and sadness,
which is reflecting and drawing people 

677
00:31:12,881 --> 00:31:16,870
to you and all of this.
And so this idea of it's a disease that,

678
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:20,690
that it's also used with alcoholism.
It just this idea.

679
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,920
People like to put these things in these
neat boxes and it doesn't really work.

680
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,630
Yeah,
I couldn't say that any better.

681
00:31:26,631 --> 00:31:27,464
And I think that there are people that 
do have mental issues that do need 

682
00:31:30,081 --> 00:31:31,820
medication.
We're not generalizing.

683
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,830
I mean,
I think just like some people have liver

684
00:31:33,831 --> 00:31:36,200
problems,
some people have thyroid issues,

685
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,183
there are absolutely people that have 
issues with their brain's ability to 

686
00:31:39,741 --> 00:31:41,990
produce serotonin.
I mean it's just a fact.

687
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:47,470
And how many of those people is the real
question and to generalize completely,

688
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:48,960
let's say,
you know,

689
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:50,443
all depression is a disease that should 
be medicated or all depression can be 

690
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:56,970
cured with exercise.
I don't know.

691
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,330
I don't think it's healthy to go either 
way.

692
00:31:59,331 --> 00:32:00,164
I think there's.
I know many people that have been in 

693
00:32:01,851 --> 00:32:02,684
really bad places in their life.
They got on some sort of an Ssri and 

694
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:07,574
then they started feeling better and 
then they wean themselves off and now 

695
00:32:09,921 --> 00:32:12,980
their life is in a way better place.
Like a good buddy of mine.

696
00:32:12,981 --> 00:32:15,570
He was suicidal.
He got an a in.

697
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:18,440
The really interesting thing is when he 
got on medication,

698
00:32:18,441 --> 00:32:22,310
like he couldn't find the right one.
And that is really so baffling.

699
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,203
So it's,
it's,

700
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,130
it's science obviously,
right?

701
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,440
When you're talking about medicine,
you're talking about medication.

702
00:32:27,441 --> 00:32:28,274
But there,
there's this little lot of guesswork to 

703
00:32:30,591 --> 00:32:31,350
this whole thing.

704
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,250
You know,
I have to say,

705
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:35,100
because I'm writing a big expo,
say now I didn't intend to do this,

706
00:32:35,101 --> 00:32:35,934
but I tried to shove it off on both Nina
tie shall send a doctor's eads and they 

707
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:40,640
wouldn't,
they wouldn't bite.

708
00:32:40,641 --> 00:32:43,250
So I'm,
I'm doing it reading medical research.

709
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,143
I can't even begin to tell you how non 
evidence based maybe even most of our 

710
00:32:48,261 --> 00:32:49,094
medical carriers,
it's so terrible and I'm lucky that I 

711
00:32:51,431 --> 00:32:52,264
have a psychiatrist now who is really 
evidence based and went on for future 

712
00:32:56,031 --> 00:32:56,864
training,
further training because I had been 

713
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:00,950
taking Ritalin,
which just made me jumpy.

714
00:33:00,951 --> 00:33:05,951
It didn't really help me with my focus.
Ritalin and Zoloft.

715
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,440
Well the sky,
he changed me.

716
00:33:09,441 --> 00:33:11,780
I told him I actually started taking.
I was self medicating.

717
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,820
This is bad.
This is before I read as much science as

718
00:33:13,821 --> 00:33:15,040
I do.
I was taking Musinex in.

719
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,020
The guy's like,
oh my gosh.

720
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,193
Yeah.
We used to kind of get behind the 

721
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:20,510
counter.
It's like in some kind of like they make

722
00:33:20,511 --> 00:33:21,410
meth out of it,
you know,

723
00:33:21,411 --> 00:33:23,000
they said you have to like sign,
you know,

724
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,640
it was buying at different pharmacies 
and hoping I wouldn't get arrested,

725
00:33:25,641 --> 00:33:26,151
you know.
Meanwhile,

726
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:27,470
I'm just taking it to right,
not,

727
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,430
you know,
do anything.

728
00:33:28,431 --> 00:33:30,560
I didn't have meth lab in my basement.
I don't have a basement.

729
00:33:30,561 --> 00:33:31,740
So that helps.
Um,

730
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,010
but um,
so this guy said,

731
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:34,844
okay,
we're gonna change you because I told 

732
00:33:36,201 --> 00:33:37,880
him I couldn't focus.
He said you can't take this,

733
00:33:37,881 --> 00:33:42,710
it's making your heart race or whatever.
And he said that this adderall,

734
00:33:42,711 --> 00:33:43,544
what it does that's different,
it pushes a little dope me up out into 

735
00:33:45,711 --> 00:33:48,440
your brain besides being a dopamine 
reuptake inhibitor,

736
00:33:48,441 --> 00:33:51,320
which we hear with Serotonin,
with the antidepressants.

737
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,990
So it regulates that.
But it also goes like spurt.

738
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:57,620
Here's little dopamine.
And the first day I was on that,

739
00:33:57,621 --> 00:33:58,454
the first pill I took,
it was the best writing day I'd had 

740
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,560
really in 20 years.
It was amazing.

741
00:34:03,561 --> 00:34:05,360
And so I'm still on the same dosage and 
everything.

742
00:34:05,361 --> 00:34:06,194
But this guy,
he gave me my life back because it was 

743
00:34:08,301 --> 00:34:10,670
tortured or right before that and,
and,

744
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,940
and that really was a big deal and so 
much of a medical care,

745
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:16,940
if you look at the stuff on Diet and 
unit tie shows has been great on this.

746
00:34:16,941 --> 00:34:18,800
Gary Tobbs,
the EADS,

747
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:19,843
you know,
there are other people on this who have 

748
00:34:20,721 --> 00:34:23,570
shown that look,
don't eat this high carb,

749
00:34:23,571 --> 00:34:26,240
low fat diet and the government 
recommends it,

750
00:34:26,241 --> 00:34:31,241
will make you sick and fat.
And I'm here this high fat,

751
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:35,870
low carbohydrate diet for many people,
maybe not all because we have individual

752
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:36,704
differences.

753
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,573
This seems to be the most healthy diet 
and also not eating polyunsaturated 

754
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:44,150
fatty acids and stuff like that that we 
know about.

755
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,830
Um,
more and more.

756
00:34:45,831 --> 00:34:47,600
And you see more and more on that.
Yeah.

757
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,291
Right.
And so,

758
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:49,370
but my doctor,
Kaiser,

759
00:34:49,371 --> 00:34:51,530
I love to say that those healthy whole 
grains on the wall,

760
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,380
there is no such thing as healthy whole 
grains.

761
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:58,280
I haven't eaten a,
been on a hamburger since 2009,

762
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,930
you know,
I just wouldn't.

763
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,003
It's just dumb.
I eat bacon and grease all day and I'm 

764
00:35:03,141 --> 00:35:04,160
very healthy.
I,

765
00:35:04,161 --> 00:35:04,994
um,
even though my doctor actually thinks 

766
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:07,850
I'm going to have artica heart detect by
next week,

767
00:35:07,851 --> 00:35:10,320
the truth is if you actually think,
well,

768
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:13,250
because my cholesterol is like 303 and 
then.

769
00:35:13,251 --> 00:35:15,890
But what I know,
and this is from Mike eades,

770
00:35:15,891 --> 00:35:19,250
the doctor who wrote the protein power,
he,

771
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:21,020
um,
he has this great blog where he talks,

772
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:23,720
he's very evidenced based but explains 
it very well.

773
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:24,554
There are these ratios.
You look at what's the ratio of your 

774
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:30,410
triglycerides to hdl.
And so basically my ratios,

775
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,800
which the doctors don't have,
Kaiser don't understood.

776
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:36,950
They are so good that I say that I'm as 
likely to have a heart attack.

777
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,880
I am to be kicked in the knee by a 
Unicorn.

778
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,950
I'm so not in danger of that and it's 
just terrible.

779
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,130
They sent me this letter to say,
eat a low fat diet.

780
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,110
Thanks

781
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,970
crazy though.
The doctors are doing this.

782
00:35:46,971 --> 00:35:47,804
I mean,
I understand that they went to school a 

783
00:35:49,071 --> 00:35:51,230
long time ago and I understand that a 
long time ago.

784
00:35:51,231 --> 00:35:54,560
That is what people thought that if your
cholesterol hit a certain point,

785
00:35:54,561 --> 00:35:58,100
you needed to take some sort of 
medication to lower your cholesterol,

786
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,353
but if you eat a healthy diet and your 
body is doing well on that healthy diet 

787
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:08,300
like you have to take into consideration
like what are the whole,

788
00:36:08,301 --> 00:36:09,134
what are the,
what are all the factors involved in in 

789
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:12,643
health and vitality and the 
understanding of hdl versus ldl and the 

790
00:36:17,391 --> 00:36:18,224
balance of triglycerides.
If you're a doctor and you don't 

791
00:36:20,991 --> 00:36:21,824
understand that and you're giving advice
and you're telling people to get on 

792
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,320
statens,
it's fucking disturb.

793
00:36:27,321 --> 00:36:29,510
It's terrible,
it's terrible,

794
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:32,150
and those statens are fucking terrible 
for you.

795
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,550
Terrible effects.
They can cause diabetes.

796
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,413
They have just the worst side effects 
and this is the thing that I look at 

797
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,223
when I'm looking at research or looking 
at because I do what I call applied 

798
00:36:41,691 --> 00:36:42,524
behavioral science,
so it's science help as opposed to self 

799
00:36:44,901 --> 00:36:47,450
help.
I look at what are the tradeoffs.

800
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,313
If I tell you this,
what are the tradeoffs in doing this 

801
00:36:50,691 --> 00:36:53,270
where you know,
where are you going to have a problem?

802
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,300
How worthwhile is this solution?
And,

803
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:59,060
and that's what doctors aren't looking 
at when they get people statens.

804
00:36:59,061 --> 00:37:01,750
It's sort of like from the drug 
companies mouths to you,

805
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,080
your gut.
Well,

806
00:37:03,081 --> 00:37:03,840
it's just so

807
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,860
many doctors are basing their decisions 
and the,

808
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:10,160
the advice they give on really old 
evidence or excuse me,

809
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,230
really old knowledge

810
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,383
evidence,
quote unquote keys fraudulent quote 

811
00:37:15,631 --> 00:37:18,790
unquote science and it's so terrible and
sees,

812
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,390
yeah,
he did this quote unquote research,

813
00:37:21,391 --> 00:37:25,240
but he excluded countries that didn't 
show searches this,

814
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,480
this is,
it was in the,

815
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:27,363
I think it was in the fifties.
He did this multiple countries study 

816
00:37:30,061 --> 00:37:33,480
where he looked at what people ate and 
what he did.

817
00:37:33,481 --> 00:37:35,610
It's like this,
there's a story from the Holocaust where

818
00:37:35,611 --> 00:37:40,170
a guy shot all these bullseyes in the 
wall and some army person came up to him

819
00:37:40,171 --> 00:37:41,970
and said,
how did you learn to shoot that way?

820
00:37:41,971 --> 00:37:42,751
He said,
it's easy.

821
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:44,790
I first shot the wall.
Then I drew the bullseye.

822
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,913
And so that's when an sell keys did with
this research and he excluded any 

823
00:37:48,271 --> 00:37:51,000
countries that didn't fit what he wanted
to say,

824
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,390
which is eat this diet that we've been 
eating.

825
00:37:54,391 --> 00:37:57,300
Our government told us to eat for years,
this high carb,

826
00:37:57,301 --> 00:38:01,230
low fat diet that actually causes you to
be just hungry motherfucker all day.

827
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,530
And then also spikes.
Yeah.

828
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,020
And so,
you know what I learned from Gary Tobbs,

829
00:38:07,021 --> 00:38:07,854
who's actually a friend of mine,
so I got an early on the low carb thing 

830
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,880
because I heard while he was writing 
this,

831
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:15,420
that carbs.
So this is potatoes,

832
00:38:15,421 --> 00:38:17,760
starchy vegetables,
fruits,

833
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:18,623
fruit juice,
they sugar these things cause the 

834
00:38:21,061 --> 00:38:25,590
insulin secretion that puts on fat that 
makes you diabetic and all these things.

835
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:29,430
And there's some indication that maybe 
Alzheimer's is diabetes.

836
00:38:29,431 --> 00:38:32,730
Three diabetes of the brain.
They need more evidence on that.

837
00:38:32,731 --> 00:38:33,564
But personally I do not eat sugar.
I eat one tiny little ice cream thing a 

838
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,610
week just so I won't feel totally 
deprived.

839
00:38:39,611 --> 00:38:40,960
But um,
when I,

840
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:44,440
when I Bacon and stuff all day,
steak and green beans,

841
00:38:44,441 --> 00:38:45,274
drowning and butter,
I don't feel deprived and it's better 

842
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:48,920
for me.
And um,

843
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,080
you know,
if you can do that,

844
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:51,610
that's not much of a sacrifice.
Okay.

845
00:38:51,611 --> 00:38:53,170
I won't eat the bond.
Big Deal.

846
00:38:53,171 --> 00:38:53,780
I read

847
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,830
Garrett's book and I had him on the 
podcast as well.

848
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,913
It's a fascinating thing,
very controversial to a lot of people 

849
00:38:58,731 --> 00:39:01,460
email me.
I need to get on and refute what he said

850
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,670
is.
All right,

851
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,713
relax.
I literally got dozens of people that 

852
00:39:05,181 --> 00:39:08,090
did that to me,
but the thing that's most shocking,

853
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:12,450
I started following mark sisson's primal
blueprint diet and when I,

854
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,920
when I started doing it,
cut out all the sugar pretty much.

855
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:16,754
I mean I fuck around every now and then,
but one of the things that was so 

856
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:20,624
shocking was my appetite,
my appetite was so unmanageable like it 

857
00:39:24,651 --> 00:39:26,330
used to.
I was ravenous.

858
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:27,164
I would eat and then I would be 
exhausted and then I would be fucking 

859
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:33,950
ravenous like four hours later.
Like if I went three hours or four hours

860
00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:36,960
without eating,
I was starving and I've,

861
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:42,240
I regularly do intermittent fasting now 
or I'll do 14 hours between,

862
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,463
between.
It's really good for your body and I 

863
00:39:44,571 --> 00:39:47,540
lost a lot of body fat for doing that 
and then the big.

864
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:51,230
But the big thing was that when it came 
time to eat,

865
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,800
it wasn't like I was holding my breath 
the entire time,

866
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:58,760
but finally it wasn't that at all.
It was just so normal and I was like,

867
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:59,623
oh.
So there's some other process that I 

868
00:40:01,341 --> 00:40:03,590
thought I,
I attributed to hunger.

869
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:04,900
I was thinking,
oh,

870
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,860
okay,
I get really hungry,

871
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,010
but it's not just hunger,
it's insulin,

872
00:40:10,011 --> 00:40:10,250
it's

873
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,380
insulin.
It makes you hungry in that way.

874
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:15,950
Before I stopped eating bread,
I went to starbucks in culver city and I

875
00:40:15,951 --> 00:40:19,580
would always get the thing that was the 
regular fatty thing,

876
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,660
Chris,
on whatever.

877
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,770
And I know I love all that kind of food.
So good.

878
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,760
But I got by accident,
somebody gave me the sugar,

879
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,500
the fat free,
whatever.

880
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:35,090
And after about 20 minutes I wanted to 
bite off somebody's arm in line.

881
00:40:35,091 --> 00:40:38,350
I wanted to kill people.
The counter get some things.

882
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,453
It makes you feel so terrible.
And I looked at all those years I had 

883
00:40:41,721 --> 00:40:43,910
dieted and I,
at one point I just thought like,

884
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,850
ah,
you know what?

885
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,450
If anybody's like me,
a little rounder than other people,

886
00:40:47,451 --> 00:40:48,284
fuck them.
And I started going to bobby's diner in 

887
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:51,920
New York City having this chicken potato
Burrito,

888
00:40:51,921 --> 00:40:53,960
which now he wouldn't eat the bread and 
the potato,

889
00:40:53,961 --> 00:40:54,794
but um,
and I started losing weight just by 

890
00:40:56,511 --> 00:40:59,030
eating like a normal human being and not
excluding fat.

891
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:01,430
And that's what,
that was sort of instructive for this.

892
00:41:01,431 --> 00:41:03,530
And now I just basically tried to eat 
fat all day,

893
00:41:03,531 --> 00:41:04,281
Greece,
Greece,

894
00:41:04,281 --> 00:41:08,210
more grease and if you don't have that 
hunger.

895
00:41:08,211 --> 00:41:09,044
And also I know it's so much healthier 
for me to not eat bread and to not eat 

896
00:41:12,891 --> 00:41:14,930
these,
we don't eat bad oils anymore.

897
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:16,670
And,
and just to tell you another weight loss

898
00:41:16,671 --> 00:41:17,504
story,
um,

899
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,490
my boyfriend,
he was elmore Leonard's researcher,

900
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,030
the crime writer for 33 years and he had
to do this book Djibouti.

901
00:41:23,031 --> 00:41:26,660
And I begged him not to go to effort 
because my boyfriend has his look as I'm

902
00:41:26,661 --> 00:41:27,494
American kidnap me and jared is going to
get kidnapped that I knew would get 

903
00:41:33,441 --> 00:41:34,610
kidnapped.
I mean he just.

904
00:41:34,611 --> 00:41:35,960
Yeah.
So I just,

905
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:36,794
you know,
I begged him not to kidnap a lot of 

906
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:39,800
people in effort.
Nobody would kidnap my boyfriend.

907
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,220
He's nervous.

908
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,410
Was that the pills talking?
Is it?

909
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:45,470
No,
it's gonna be mad at me for saying this,

910
00:41:45,471 --> 00:41:47,480
but he wants,
got his pocket picked in Paris.

911
00:41:47,481 --> 00:41:49,370
He just looks like the American guy 
that,

912
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,660
you know,
do something too.

913
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:51,913
So.
And he's a big guy from Detroit so it's 

914
00:41:53,481 --> 00:41:55,470
not like he's wimpy or anything.
Um,

915
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:56,323
but I um,
he needed to lose some weight and some 

916
00:41:59,241 --> 00:42:02,450
doctor gave him these like candy bars 
that are $230,

917
00:42:02,451 --> 00:42:03,000
you know,
and,

918
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,460
and the thing of like,
being from Detroit,

919
00:42:04,461 --> 00:42:05,960
not wanting to be ripped off,
I said okay,

920
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:09,230
if you do exactly what I say because 
he's a guy guy so he's not like,

921
00:42:09,231 --> 00:42:10,640
you know,
I'll do exactly what you say,

922
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:13,970
but I said you will lose weight and you 
will not be hungry.

923
00:42:13,971 --> 00:42:16,520
So I put them on a diet of a bacon,
eggs.

924
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,413
He could eat meat,
no vegetables and just copy and spring 

925
00:42:20,941 --> 00:42:21,950
water vegetables.

926
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,950
Yeah.
This is like,

927
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,590
this is like,
remember Dr Atkins,

928
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,693
the Atkins Induction Diet,
you have to take magnesium or it can be 

929
00:42:28,161 --> 00:42:30,620
blocked up like the Berlin Wall inside 
itself.

930
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,233
But um,
he lost 30 pounds in five weeks while 

931
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,780
sitting in his chair researching 
Djibouti.

932
00:42:35,781 --> 00:42:39,260
The book delmore ended up doing and he 
did not leave his chair.

933
00:42:39,261 --> 00:42:42,710
He turns librarians on the phone and 
embassy people and stuff like that.

934
00:42:42,711 --> 00:42:43,544
But is no vegetables a good idea?
It seems like you need vitamins now 

935
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,850
eventually.
But actually tops has said,

936
00:42:49,851 --> 00:42:54,851
we talked about this once and he said 
basically that meat has all the vitamins

937
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:58,400
except vitamin C and I'm sort of 
paraphrasing from long time ago,

938
00:42:58,401 --> 00:42:59,810
so forgive me if I get this wrong,
but.

939
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:00,763
And that if you.
But if you are eating meat rather than 

940
00:43:02,691 --> 00:43:04,730
carbs,
maybe you don't get vitamin C deficient,

941
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,480
you look at them Osi and also the,
the Eskimos.

942
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:08,423
I think it's the nun.
I think Stefansson was a guy who was up 

943
00:43:11,031 --> 00:43:13,880
there and before they started eating a 
western diet,

944
00:43:13,881 --> 00:43:14,714
they just stayed blubber and whale meat 
and I guess they maybe a penguin here 

945
00:43:18,381 --> 00:43:20,510
and there.
The penguins.

946
00:43:20,511 --> 00:43:23,930
Penguins.
I think around our cake with a different

947
00:43:23,931 --> 00:43:26,490
part of the world and nuggets you,
I'm really good on geography.

948
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:29,770
Lincoln say south.
I failed geography obviously.

949
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:31,123
Right?

950
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,310
I know that they,
and they also had extremely low rates of

951
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:37,310
cancer and there were just healthier 
humans.

952
00:43:37,311 --> 00:43:37,430
Right.

953
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:41,330
It's changed as soon as they started 
eating the western Diet and Tom's brings

954
00:43:41,331 --> 00:43:42,710
up the pima Indians.
Same thing.

955
00:43:42,711 --> 00:43:45,170
Do they have horrible problems with 
diabetes?

956
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,520
Do also though the

957
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:50,240
to,
to throw some other stuff in there.

958
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:53,150
That was also an issue with alcoholism 
and cigarettes.

959
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:54,183
There's a,
the,

960
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,920
the cancer and the heart attacks and a 
lot of the things that happened with the

961
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:58,190
nun.
A lot of people,

962
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:03,410
there's a correlation between extreme 
consumption of cigarettes and alcohol.

963
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,100
So it's,
it's not just a,

964
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:05,934
the American diet,
it's all the vices that go along with 

965
00:44:07,851 --> 00:44:10,160
that.
We're good at producing this.

966
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:11,143
Yeah,
we suck.

967
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,790
We import horrible things.
I mean,

968
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:16,560
liquid we did not.
We obviously you and I weren't alive,

969
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:17,963
but whoever looked like us that did that
to the native Americans introducing 

970
00:44:21,141 --> 00:44:22,460
alcohol to them and they,
you know,

971
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:26,270
they didn't know what to do with it.
Bodies weren't used to it.

972
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,590
Yeah.
It's,

973
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:29,660
um,
there's a doctor,

974
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:30,763
um,
that I'm going to have on the soon who 

975
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,710
is on twitter.
I mean,

976
00:44:33,711 --> 00:44:36,270
I have no idea if this guy's not a.

977
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,350
yeah,
everybody is,

978
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:38,730
um,
I'll tell you right now,

979
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:42,600
but this gentleman is a,
he's a full carnivore.

980
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,290
All he does is eat meat and he holds a 
bunch of records,

981
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:47,730
uh,
in a,

982
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,130
like athletic pursuits.
It's really kind of interesting.

983
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:50,721
You know,
this,

984
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:53,160
this Guy Stephen Phinney is it,
I'll tell you in a minute,

985
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:54,493
I'll pull them up real quick,
but he and I had been going back and 

986
00:44:57,301 --> 00:44:59,970
forth trying to figure out a time to get
him on the podcast,

987
00:44:59,971 --> 00:45:04,971
but he's 50 years old and it's pretty 
impressive what he's been able to do and

988
00:45:05,521 --> 00:45:07,740
all he does is eat meat,
doesn't eat anything but meat,

989
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,690
you know,
and he's an md,

990
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:12,570
so of course the fucking Internet's not 
working here.

991
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:16,830
Going on with the Internet here.
Young Jamie month working.

992
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:18,480
Yeah,
piece of shit.

993
00:45:18,481 --> 00:45:19,314
Laptop.
This laptop has been the worst one I've 

994
00:45:21,181 --> 00:45:25,560
ever had as far as like connecting,
like it takes forever to reconnect.

995
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,240
Yeah.
I hate that anywhere.

996
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,650
I never leave the house.
I'm always on my big computer.

997
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,600
You never leave the house?
Not Lately.

998
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:34,000
I wrote a book for three years that 
spent three years trying to kill me.

999
00:45:34,001 --> 00:45:36,850
So Jesus Christ,
my boyfriend brought me food.

1000
00:45:36,851 --> 00:45:39,310
Otherwise I would've eaten frozen hot 
dogs for three years.

1001
00:45:39,311 --> 00:45:41,050
Select the meat guy.
But that's not good,

1002
00:45:41,051 --> 00:45:42,310
right?
I wasn't.

1003
00:45:42,311 --> 00:45:43,031
But the book,
you know,

1004
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:43,864
what happened.
So you plan on writing this book and I 

1005
00:45:45,311 --> 00:45:45,581
thought,
Oh,

1006
00:45:45,581 --> 00:45:48,220
this'll be easier.
So this is this book on how to transform

1007
00:45:48,221 --> 00:45:50,030
to be confident.
And um,

1008
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:51,191
I thought,
okay,

1009
00:45:51,191 --> 00:45:52,024
this will be easy because I've been 
writing this in my column for so many 

1010
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:54,933
years.
And then I look into the science and I 

1011
00:45:55,601 --> 00:45:57,490
look a little deeper and I think,
oh my God,

1012
00:45:57,491 --> 00:46:00,310
this is so horrible.
And what happens is.

1013
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:03,310
So this professor will do these people,
these researchers,

1014
00:46:03,311 --> 00:46:05,740
they do some research but they don't 
totally support it.

1015
00:46:05,741 --> 00:46:07,870
And then they don't work in a 
transdisciplinary way.

1016
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:08,973
So you have to support.
This one's researched with that one's 

1017
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:11,734
research and this became this big thing.
And I just kept having nightmares about 

1018
00:46:15,311 --> 00:46:19,270
my editor who's a nice man,
chasing me down the street asking for my

1019
00:46:19,271 --> 00:46:24,271
advanced back with an x and x.
and x or acts like an x.

1020
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,130
right?

1021
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:27,800
Um,
well this guy's A.

1022
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,510
I don't even know his full name.
His uh,

1023
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:33,910
his twitter name is s Baker.
He is a heroin.

1024
00:46:33,911 --> 00:46:38,911
When kidding to hear trades.
S Baker md is his twitter name,

1025
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:40,723
the sport world record holding masters 
50 plus athlete nutrition for 

1026
00:46:44,131 --> 00:46:46,950
performance and health,
healthcare and not sick care.

1027
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:50,060
No medical advice here.
And all he does is eat meat.

1028
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:51,930
Well,
nothing but meat.

1029
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,000
The Guy I mentioned.
So Stephen Finney,

1030
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,080
he is a dietary researcher.
He and Jeff Volek wrote a very good book

1031
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,520
on low carb.
Jeff,

1032
00:46:59,521 --> 00:47:00,354
Alex,
also dietary researcher and Finney I 

1033
00:47:03,421 --> 00:47:04,254
think bicycles competitively or very 
intensely and he says that I'm eating 

1034
00:47:11,341 --> 00:47:12,174
low carb.
There's apparently some hump you get 

1035
00:47:13,411 --> 00:47:15,210
over,
but then that is better.

1036
00:47:15,211 --> 00:47:18,110
It gives you more energy than this 
whole,

1037
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:22,470
like drink some gatorade that people 
have held as the conventional wisdom.

1038
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:23,943
Yeah,
but it's not the case with like extreme 

1039
00:47:25,331 --> 00:47:28,960
endurance sports and oh there's one guy 
that we talked about.

1040
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:30,040
What do you got here?

1041
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,780
Sean Baker.
Dr Sean Baker,

1042
00:47:31,781 --> 00:47:36,781
Carnivore Diet Zero carb Diet plan guy 
looks healthy as fuck.

1043
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:39,100
He's on the right hand side.
Yeah,

1044
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:44,130
he does mean he's jacked and he's dunks 
basketballs and lift weights and shit.

1045
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:46,680
But he might just be some athletic 
freak.

1046
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:49,110
I,
I just don't know if it's jeans too.

1047
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,420
It could be.
I'm lucky I have good genes,

1048
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:52,283
you know,
the boyfriend looks at a saltine and he 

1049
00:47:53,821 --> 00:47:54,654
gained three pounds and I'm lucky.
So my family were eastern European 

1050
00:47:58,111 --> 00:47:58,944
should hold Jews and you know,
probably wasn't a lot of food and I 

1051
00:48:01,231 --> 00:48:02,064
don't know,
somehow my body learn to manage that 

1052
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,940
having lot and having not a lot and it 
manages it better.

1053
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,150
Sure.
Um,

1054
00:48:07,151 --> 00:48:07,984
I'm just,
I'm wondering whether or not that's a 

1055
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:12,850
really a viable diet to just eat only 
meat.

1056
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,713
It just seems like,

1057
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:16,550
well the Messiah do it and,
and,

1058
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,420
and they,
and they did it.

1059
00:48:18,421 --> 00:48:21,810
And so the question is,
are you missing nutrients?

1060
00:48:21,811 --> 00:48:24,420
And I'm not the person to answer this.
Are you missing nutrients?

1061
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,640
And that's the problem with being 
vegetarian.

1062
00:48:26,641 --> 00:48:28,860
There's a guy named Chris Kresser who's 
posted on this.

1063
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:30,390
Oh Great.
I love this.

1064
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:31,290
Yeah.
He.

1065
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:34,290
And so he has some really good posts 
about what you're missing.

1066
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:35,700
If you provide your tarion and people 
say,

1067
00:48:35,701 --> 00:48:36,630
well,
I take vitamins,

1068
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:37,793
but can you get the vitamins in the way 
you need in the way your body uses them 

1069
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:44,130
from taking vitamin pills or even from 
eating,

1070
00:48:44,131 --> 00:48:45,870
you have to eat a ton of this,
you know,

1071
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:47,400
I don't know,
being curt or something.

1072
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:49,350
Um,
and I don't want to have soy.

1073
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:52,050
That's the problem.
That's the dishonesty.

1074
00:48:52,051 --> 00:48:55,070
But vegetarianism and some people 
knowingly make that tradeoff,

1075
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:56,910
but I sure wouldn't.
I'm sorry.

1076
00:48:56,911 --> 00:48:58,660
As much as the bunnies are cute and

1077
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:02,410
Chris Kresser was a Vegan for a long 
time and you know,

1078
00:49:02,411 --> 00:49:03,244
he's had,
he had some pretty serious health 

1079
00:49:04,111 --> 00:49:06,400
consequences because of that.
But you know,

1080
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:07,403
that's just him.
Some people were fine with the Vegan 

1081
00:49:09,211 --> 00:49:10,044
diet and that's one of the most 
important things to talk about is that 

1082
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:12,923
the,
the biodiversity in human beings is 

1083
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:17,100
very,
it is a broad,

1084
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:20,520
broad spectrum of what people need and 
what people don't need.

1085
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:22,920
Which is why some people like my friend 
Brian,

1086
00:49:22,921 --> 00:49:27,360
his mom can't even touch Brazil nuts.
Have she ate a Brazil nut.

1087
00:49:27,361 --> 00:49:30,270
She'd go into shock and she'd be dead.
I mean,

1088
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,880
I can eat them all day long.
They taste like shit.

1089
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:36,420
I don't totally like them,
but you know,

1090
00:49:36,421 --> 00:49:39,030
there's,
there's a giant curve was

1091
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:39,990
right.
Yeah.

1092
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:43,470
This is the individual differences thing
that I was talking about before.

1093
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,930
And there's,
there's this big push to say,

1094
00:49:45,931 --> 00:49:46,764
oh,
men and women are alike and groups are 

1095
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:50,950
no different from each other,
but you know,

1096
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,153
you don't see Jews as NBA basketball 
stars and Jews and people from 

1097
00:49:56,941 --> 00:50:01,110
northeastern Europe tend to have lactose
tolerance in a way other people do not.

1098
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:06,670
So where we are from where we mainly our
evolution took place that,

1099
00:50:07,501 --> 00:50:09,120
you know,
and I mean that goes back way,

1100
00:50:09,121 --> 00:50:09,601
way,
way,

1101
00:50:09,601 --> 00:50:11,060
way back,
um,

1102
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:12,203
that,
um,

1103
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:13,043
that affects our skills,
our abilities as well as our digestive 

1104
00:50:16,981 --> 00:50:18,330
abilities.
You know,

1105
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,313
can you eat this kind of thing,
can you drink liquor and not be really 

1106
00:50:22,081 --> 00:50:23,880
effected by it.
All those things.

1107
00:50:23,881 --> 00:50:24,714
And so that's the stuff that people 
don't like to look at everyone the way 

1108
00:50:27,621 --> 00:50:31,220
you were talking about before that 
people like to say it's just like this.

1109
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:34,200
It's this thing,
this is a disease and it's horrible.

1110
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:35,323
You know that,
that lack of nuance that's just so 

1111
00:50:37,161 --> 00:50:37,994
stupid and it's so sort of anti solution
what people like to do when people do 

1112
00:50:42,111 --> 00:50:43,010
that,
that thing of,

1113
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:45,620
you know,
saying things are one way.

1114
00:50:45,621 --> 00:50:49,670
It's often in a way too.
I think that people try to feel superior

1115
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,580
who try to simplify things too much.
They do that so that too,

1116
00:50:52,581 --> 00:50:54,890
because we'd like to understand things,
so I think it's that.

1117
00:50:54,891 --> 00:50:55,724
And then also there's a tendency to want
to prosecute people to say you are a 

1118
00:50:59,701 --> 00:51:00,534
slovenly fat person and the reason you 
are a heavy is that you did not go to 

1119
00:51:04,221 --> 00:51:05,054
the gym and I went to the gym and I am a
Holy Gym Goer and you are a scummy 

1120
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:12,140
terribles couch sitter and that's not 
the case.

1121
00:51:12,141 --> 00:51:12,974
In fact,
tobbs wrote a great piece for New York 

1122
00:51:14,061 --> 00:51:17,900
magazine about how we think exercise 
makes us thinner,

1123
00:51:17,901 --> 00:51:18,734
but it doesn't and the reasons you were 
saying before for doing it for mental 

1124
00:51:21,531 --> 00:51:22,364
health.
I try to do that when I'm feeling just 

1125
00:51:23,901 --> 00:51:24,734
my worst.
I make myself get on the bike and do 

1126
00:51:26,571 --> 00:51:31,280
these high intensity intervals because I
know that that'll help me mentally.

1127
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:32,920
No,
I feel like I'll be there.

1128
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,100
Sure.
Interesting exercise doesn't make people

1129
00:51:35,101 --> 00:51:35,934
thinner.

1130
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:37,083
That's what.
That's what tops in this piece says and 

1131
00:51:38,891 --> 00:51:40,570
that's what I see over and over again 
and believe me,

1132
00:51:40,571 --> 00:51:41,404
we don't want to believe that and I 
think people can lose weight through 

1133
00:51:44,081 --> 00:51:45,550
exercise,
but they get hungrier.

1134
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,710
That's the problem.
It's not you don't you exercise,

1135
00:51:47,711 --> 00:51:48,544
you get hungrier and you replace that.
I don't have all the nuances on this so 

1136
00:51:51,761 --> 00:51:52,594
everyone should look up that top piece 
in New York magazine because he's just 

1137
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:55,510
fantastic and it

1138
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,910
with all that is,
it's very anecdotal.

1139
00:51:57,970 --> 00:51:58,803
You know when,
when you start saying that diet is the 

1140
00:52:00,671 --> 00:52:03,220
way to go and that exercise does not 
make you thin.

1141
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,720
It's anecdotal because some people 
exercise absolutely make some thing.

1142
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,180
I mean there's.
I know a lot of people that have started

1143
00:52:10,181 --> 00:52:12,070
doing Jujitsu and lost 30,
40 pounds.

1144
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:15,250
I know a lot of people that have done 
that and it works,

1145
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,230
you know,
because it's extremely strenuous,

1146
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,093
extremely rigorous.
She burned off a ton of a ton of 

1147
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:21,580
calories.
You accelerate your metabolism,

1148
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:26,080
your metabolism starts burning off fat 
at an unprecedented rate for your body,

1149
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,450
and it does work,
but it's like,

1150
00:52:28,451 --> 00:52:30,430
what kind of exercise do you engage?
Again,

1151
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:31,030
you know,
that's,

1152
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:34,510
that's another factor,
like are you just doing like a long slow

1153
00:52:34,511 --> 00:52:38,860
jog with very low intensity or are you 
doing like power lifting?

1154
00:52:38,861 --> 00:52:39,694
Like there's a lot of evidence that 
actual weightlifting is way better for 

1155
00:52:43,061 --> 00:52:46,570
burning fat than anything else because 
when you weight lift,

1156
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,380
your body makes more muscle,
more muscle consumes more calories,

1157
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:52,930
and if you have the same amount of 
calorie intake,

1158
00:52:52,931 --> 00:52:53,764
but now your body has more requirements,
it'll start burning off some of that 

1159
00:52:56,441 --> 00:52:57,080
fat.

1160
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,590
I think that's a really great point.
And I am not one to,

1161
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:00,463
that's I'm not,
I'm not an expert in this area and I 

1162
00:53:02,331 --> 00:53:05,000
haven't read very much in it,
but I have read this.

1163
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:06,530
Um,
what's the guy's name?

1164
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:07,880
Um,
shoot,

1165
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:09,230
I'm not gonna remember it,
Mikey.

1166
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:11,070
It's wrote a book with him.
It's um,

1167
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:14,780
it's slow burn fitness.
And actually I do that.

1168
00:53:14,781 --> 00:53:15,614
I lift weights.
You lift them until your muscles are 

1169
00:53:17,241 --> 00:53:20,270
just screaming and I can live like eight
pounds because I'm totally wimpy.

1170
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:21,910
Um,
but um,

1171
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:24,770
and you do it really slowly,
so slowly,

1172
00:53:24,771 --> 00:53:28,830
like times barely moving and that does 
increase your metabolism.

1173
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:31,890
It improves your heart,
um,

1174
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:35,160
improves your cardiovascular system and 
what's the other thing?

1175
00:53:35,161 --> 00:53:37,710
And it does help weight loss.
So the new one,

1176
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,270
there are nuances on that.
And I just,

1177
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:41,910
I say that because when I look at the 
tops thing,

1178
00:53:41,911 --> 00:53:43,980
all this stuff,
he support stuff very well.

1179
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,083
It makes sense,
but I'm a little light on what the 

1180
00:53:46,201 --> 00:53:48,060
details are.
So admittedly,

1181
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:48,923
you know,
I,

1182
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:49,763
I think you bring up a good point on 
that and also the individual 

1183
00:53:51,601 --> 00:53:54,360
differences,
things that we are the thing that we are

1184
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:55,194
different and so some people are able to
lose weight in ways that other people 

1185
00:53:59,881 --> 00:54:01,380
may be or not.
But I think this

1186
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,210
you see with kids,
do you have kids?

1187
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:04,440
No,
I have kids.

1188
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:05,274
And one of the things you see is like,
you see kids that can just fucking eat 

1189
00:54:08,401 --> 00:54:10,890
anything.
They eat anything and they're skinny and

1190
00:54:10,891 --> 00:54:14,700
then you see other kids that they're 
just really struggling on a really early

1191
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:15,533
age and their body packs on a ton of fat
and they have those extreme endomorph 

1192
00:54:19,321 --> 00:54:22,030
bodies and there's,
you know,

1193
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:24,180
it's clear differences and,
and they,

1194
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:26,880
they are both on the playground together
at the same time.

1195
00:54:26,881 --> 00:54:27,714
They're both the same age.
You're not dealing with a lifetime of 

1196
00:54:29,761 --> 00:54:30,594
abuse.
You're talking about 10 year olds right 

1197
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:31,840
now.

1198
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:36,100
So it comes down to me to how does your 
body process nutrients,

1199
00:54:36,101 --> 00:54:36,934
how does it process the food you take in
and how well does it do it and where 

1200
00:54:40,331 --> 00:54:42,420
does it store it?
And so you know,

1201
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:43,970
those kids who are,
you know the,

1202
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:46,180
if you had them do the same kind of 
play,

1203
00:54:46,181 --> 00:54:50,080
you will see that one kid ends up being 
fatter and one isn't and,

1204
00:54:50,081 --> 00:54:51,040
and it's not,
you know,

1205
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:51,874
if you fed them the exact same things,
you can see that the factories just 

1206
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,710
working differently in one kid had 
genetics.

1207
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,230
The other thing to take into 
consideration,

1208
00:54:59,231 --> 00:55:01,150
you were talking about lactose 
intolerance,

1209
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:01,993
intolerance.
One of the things that I read recently 

1210
00:55:04,031 --> 00:55:04,864
is that a big part of lactose 
intolerance can be attributed to the 

1211
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:12,040
homogenization and pasteurization of 
milk and that you know,

1212
00:55:12,041 --> 00:55:14,650
we're very concerned about diseases,
rightly so,

1213
00:55:14,651 --> 00:55:18,970
and that's why I'm in freshness and but 
milk's not supposed to be able to sit on

1214
00:55:18,971 --> 00:55:21,490
a shelf for three weeks.
It's just not supposed to.

1215
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:24,100
You're supposed to get milk if you drink
it at all,

1216
00:55:24,101 --> 00:55:24,934
it should be fresh and that way it has 
the enzymes in it and that what we're 

1217
00:55:27,581 --> 00:55:28,414
doing by boiling this milk and 
pasteurizing and homogenizing it is 

1218
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:32,194
where you're creating this dead protein,
liquid shit that your body doesn't know 

1219
00:55:35,351 --> 00:55:39,820
what the fuck to do with and then the 
weirder ones is when you take it and you

1220
00:55:39,821 --> 00:55:40,654
suck the fat out of it.
Like when you have low fat milk and a 

1221
00:55:43,121 --> 00:55:45,760
lot of people don't even realize it.
Low fat milk has sugar in it.

1222
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:49,210
They literally add sugar to low fat milk
to make it palatable.

1223
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,520
So disgusting.
I didn't know that.

1224
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:52,780
Not you're not getting anything.
It's not.

1225
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:57,190
It might be low fat is in fat content,
but as in the effects it's going to have

1226
00:55:57,191 --> 00:55:58,810
on your body,
it's not low fat at all.

1227
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:00,170
Yeah.
Actually Jeff Volek,

1228
00:56:00,171 --> 00:56:03,620
that dietary researcher basically agreed
with me when I said to him,

1229
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,980
so is it basically child abuse to feed 
your child skim milk?

1230
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:07,551
I mean,
here we are,

1231
00:56:07,551 --> 00:56:09,620
America.
We're a very wealthy country.

1232
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:12,470
People are feeding their children 
nutrient free food.

1233
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:14,340
It's so crazy.
Well,

1234
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:14,670
there I

1235
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:18,810
have not had enough time to study the 
research.

1236
00:56:18,811 --> 00:56:19,980
They have to.
Most people,

1237
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,083
they.
What they hear is if you eat 

1238
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:24,880
cholesterol,
you'll get fat.

1239
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:29,080
If you eat saturated fats,
you'll have a heart attack,

1240
00:56:29,081 --> 00:56:32,260
and there you're talking about like 19 
sixties knowledge.

1241
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:36,160
You talk to top of the food chain 
researchers today,

1242
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:38,560
no pun intended,
in 2017,

1243
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:42,310
and they'll tell you quite the opposite.
They'll tell you that saturated fats and

1244
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:43,144
cholesterol are actually good for you,
that they are the precursors for 

1245
00:56:45,731 --> 00:56:46,564
hormones.
Your body uses them to produce 

1246
00:56:48,041 --> 00:56:48,874
testosterone,
like your body uses them to produce 

1247
00:56:50,861 --> 00:56:51,694
hormones and that this idea that eating 
cholesterol raises your blood 

1248
00:56:57,191 --> 00:56:59,260
cholesterol.
That's not true.

1249
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,153
Right,
and actually we've been so credulous as 

1250
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:05,020
as people,
I think probably it's not just us,

1251
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:05,854
it's probably around the globe for many,
many decades and now part of the good 

1252
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:10,413
part of having all this media is that 
more of the sort of the counterpoint 

1253
00:57:14,621 --> 00:57:17,770
gets out there and so it's been sort of 
a religion.

1254
00:57:17,771 --> 00:57:20,920
People have believed this because the 
government put it out.

1255
00:57:20,921 --> 00:57:25,390
The American Heart Association,
the Ama put it out saying fat is,

1256
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,920
excuse me,
fat is bad.

1257
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:28,900
And recently they did it again with 
capstone.

1258
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,630
Yet it's so terrible.
So not evidence based.

1259
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:32,543
It's no

1260
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:33,853
send it to a bunch of people like Rhonda
Patrick and all the doctors and 

1261
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:38,820
scientists that I know.
I'm like,

1262
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:42,760
am I wrong here or is this crap?
And on it wrote a piece,

1263
00:57:42,761 --> 00:57:47,260
one of the researchers for on it wrote a
piece of essentially saying the American

1264
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:48,093
Heart Association is essentially whack.
It's kind of a whack institution and 

1265
00:57:50,621 --> 00:57:51,820
they're not on top of the ball.

1266
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:52,803
Yeah.
I just found this with another medical 

1267
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:54,604
association in this piece I'm writing 
and it's really terrible because what 

1268
00:57:57,671 --> 00:58:01,120
happens is,
so doctor say that you go to an Hmo,

1269
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:01,983
those doctors,
they go by the recommendations of these 

1270
00:58:04,661 --> 00:58:05,494
big associations,
so you've got the big associations 

1271
00:58:07,721 --> 00:58:08,554
telling basically medical fairy tales.
They're continuing to tell the same 

1272
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:16,330
fairytale that they've told and people 
are basing their healthcare decisions on

1273
00:58:16,331 --> 00:58:18,880
that doctors are and then the patients 
are listening.

1274
00:58:18,881 --> 00:58:19,601
They assume,
okay,

1275
00:58:19,601 --> 00:58:20,434
you're wearing a white coat and you went
to medical school and I went to school 

1276
00:58:22,391 --> 00:58:23,224
of Google.
I guess I'll listen to you and that's 

1277
00:58:25,691 --> 00:58:26,524
really,
really damaging and this is why I think 

1278
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:31,320
Nina Tie Scholtz.
I'm Dr Eades,

1279
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:32,163
Gary Tobbs,
all these people you know who've done 

1280
00:58:34,121 --> 00:58:36,700
this work to put this put out the real 
science,

1281
00:58:36,701 --> 00:58:37,534
they have saved an enormous amount of 
lives and stop people from having 

1282
00:58:40,631 --> 00:58:41,464
horrible diseases.
I really think that they're all heroic 

1283
00:58:43,361 --> 00:58:45,880
because it's been a fight to put that 
stuff out.

1284
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:49,930
It's been a big battle for them and they
have people fighting them all the time.

1285
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:50,983
Well,
most people that go to a doctor for 

1286
00:58:51,771 --> 00:58:54,120
advice,
but the reality about medical schools,

1287
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,630
you'd take very little time to learn 
about nutrition.

1288
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:57,753
It's a lot of these guys,
whether it's an orthopedic surgeon or 

1289
00:58:59,991 --> 00:59:00,824
the whatever the specialty is,
the idea that these people are the goto 

1290
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:07,573
expert on every single area of the body,
including nutritional absorption is 

1291
00:59:10,581 --> 00:59:11,414
ridiculous.
It's just not the case and there's a 

1292
00:59:13,881 --> 00:59:14,714
great many people that know more about 
nutrition and especially state of the 

1293
00:59:19,041 --> 00:59:22,760
art and nutrition.
Then your does unfortunately.

1294
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:23,803
But see if you realize that then you're 
already ahead of the game and you can 

1295
00:59:26,061 --> 00:59:26,930
say,
okay,

1296
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,063
I'm going to,
I am going to use you for tests and 

1297
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:34,070
tried to sucks.
It really sucks.

1298
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:35,893
I mean,
there are obviously some great doctors 

1299
00:59:36,771 --> 00:59:39,140
out there in the Ken give you some,
like,

1300
00:59:39,141 --> 00:59:39,980
um,
my doctor,

1301
00:59:39,981 --> 00:59:41,320
Dr Gordon,
Mark Gordon,

1302
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,020
he's also an expert in traumatic brain 
injury and uh,

1303
00:59:45,021 --> 00:59:45,854
you know,
he's a really nuanced guy and when I 

1304
00:59:48,081 --> 00:59:48,914
talked to him about cholesterol and all 
these different factors and ldl and hdl 

1305
00:59:52,671 --> 00:59:53,504
and triglycerides and he can give me a 
research based sort of point of view on 

1306
00:59:58,491 --> 01:00:02,750
it because he's doing it himself.
I mean he's eating this way himself.

1307
01:00:02,751 --> 01:00:04,880
He's paying attention to all the latest 
stuff,

1308
01:00:04,881 --> 01:00:07,730
but he's got a voracious appetite for 
that stuff.

1309
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:09,770
There's a lot of people that just don't 
want to be bothered.

1310
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,200
They got their degree in 1982 and 
they're done.

1311
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:13,930
I know.
And it's so terrible.

1312
01:00:13,931 --> 01:00:15,940
And see if your doctor discloses that to
you.

1313
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:17,043
If they say,
look,

1314
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:17,993
I am really known nothing about diet and
I'm going to give you advice because 

1315
01:00:21,221 --> 01:00:22,054
they say that I should give you advice,
but really it's not based in anything 

1316
01:00:24,341 --> 01:00:26,260
other than they printed out some sheets 
here.

1317
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:28,480
Then okay.
Because then you're informed.

1318
01:00:28,481 --> 01:00:31,450
It's not like your doctor is leading you
on with the white coat,

1319
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:33,190
but most people are being led on,

1320
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:35,770
well,
it's just we have this idea,

1321
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:37,150
you know,
we have this idea that,

1322
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:38,013
you know,
what,

1323
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:39,580
what,
what I need to do to be healthy.

1324
01:00:39,581 --> 01:00:40,420
Well,
you know,

1325
01:00:40,421 --> 01:00:43,210
maybe I should go on a vegetarian diet.
That'll be healthy.

1326
01:00:43,211 --> 01:00:44,050
Well,
listen,

1327
01:00:44,051 --> 01:00:44,884
if you read fucking cupcakes and 
Burritos and fucking cheese doodles all 

1328
01:00:48,551 --> 01:00:49,384
day.
Yeah,

1329
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:51,700
a Vegan Diet,
it's going to be amazing for you.

1330
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:54,310
It's going to really do a great job.
The question is,

1331
01:00:54,311 --> 01:00:55,640
is it optimal?
It might be,

1332
01:00:55,641 --> 01:00:58,530
it might be optimal for you and put it 
might not be optimal for you.

1333
01:00:58,790 --> 01:00:59,770
You know,
might be for me,

1334
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:01,140
maybe it's my thing,
you know,

1335
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:02,163
but if trying and trial and error 
becomes really difficult for people 

1336
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:10,330
because most people have jobs and 
families and obligations and hobbies and

1337
01:01:10,331 --> 01:01:11,164
things they like to do.
They don't want to spend time going 

1338
01:01:12,761 --> 01:01:16,450
through pub med studies and trying to 
figure out what the fuck is a good thing

1339
01:01:16,451 --> 01:01:18,580
to eat and the bad thing to eat and you 
know,

1340
01:01:18,581 --> 01:01:20,770
what are the variables?
Is it based on,

1341
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:22,450
you know,
the origin of my ancestors?

1342
01:01:22,451 --> 01:01:23,950
Do I have to like,
think about,

1343
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,273
you know,
those ancestral diet people that are 

1344
01:01:26,261 --> 01:01:27,190
really into that,
like,

1345
01:01:27,191 --> 01:01:28,060
you know,
like where are you,

1346
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:30,280
where are your people from?
Like where did they grow up doing,

1347
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,170
you know?

1348
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:32,150
Right.
Boy,

1349
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:35,680
it's very hard and the great thing is 
that there,

1350
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:36,563
there is more stuff out there that's 
written for lay people were people who 

1351
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:40,733
read the research,
explain it to people in a way that is 

1352
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:44,483
very clear and understandable so people 
can make more of their own decision I 

1353
01:01:47,431 --> 01:01:48,870
think,
than they ever could before.

1354
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:50,580
It was also people that are super 
cynical.

1355
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:51,271
They're like,
hey man,

1356
01:01:51,271 --> 01:01:52,104
I grew up with Dr Susan.
The Food Pyramid was always weed at the 

1357
01:01:53,941 --> 01:01:56,250
bottom and the top was all this other 
stuff,

1358
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:57,293
but now everybody's flipping the food 
pyramid and you just taken out the 

1359
01:01:59,401 --> 01:02:00,960
bottom part entirely.
Like,

1360
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,540
and so what,
what's gonna happen five years from now?

1361
01:02:03,541 --> 01:02:04,321
You're going to tell me,
well,

1362
01:02:04,321 --> 01:02:06,690
high fat is actually terrible for your 
brain.

1363
01:02:06,691 --> 01:02:07,890
Or,
you know,

1364
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:08,813
it's just people are understandably 
tired of all this stuff and it's real 

1365
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:19,620
easy to just sort of compartmentalize 
and just push it away and listen to your

1366
01:02:19,621 --> 01:02:20,454
doctor.

1367
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:21,450
Yeah,
it really is.

1368
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,313
And the thing,
the point you made before about the 

1369
01:02:23,101 --> 01:02:25,110
people who are eating the cheetos and 
cupcakes,

1370
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,550
Diane,
well of course,

1371
01:02:26,551 --> 01:02:28,390
if you start eating a Vegan Diet,
you know,

1372
01:02:28,391 --> 01:02:31,650
you're not eating cheetos and cupcakes,
you know you're going to see an effect.

1373
01:02:31,651 --> 01:02:33,300
But is that a good effect,
you know,

1374
01:02:33,301 --> 01:02:36,120
in terms of your longterm health and you
know,

1375
01:02:36,121 --> 01:02:36,954
we see that vegetarians don't have 
necessary proteins that you get very 

1376
01:02:39,781 --> 01:02:41,650
easily from meat with no training

1377
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,500
to eat,
like a balanced amino acid profile.

1378
01:02:44,501 --> 01:02:49,190
Foods like I know pea protein and hemp 
proteins.

1379
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:50,540
Very good keen keenwah

1380
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:51,540
you know,
more than I am.

1381
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:52,374
This I,
this isn't my area because I don't care 

1382
01:02:53,761 --> 01:02:57,840
about that stuff since I'm not 
vegetarian and wouldn't eat that way,

1383
01:02:57,841 --> 01:03:00,840
but I see that.
So people like Chris Kresser try to help

1384
01:03:00,841 --> 01:03:01,980
people to say,
look,

1385
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:03,023
here's the deal.
And so you can make some choices and 

1386
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:06,840
decide,
you know,

1387
01:03:06,841 --> 01:03:07,674
is there a way for me as a vegetarian to
get the nutrients I need or am I always 

1388
01:03:11,461 --> 01:03:13,980
going to be deficient and how might that
affect my health?

1389
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,180
So what are the tradeoffs?

1390
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:16,093
Yeah.
But some people they don't think of it 

1391
01:03:17,091 --> 01:03:17,924
purely as a health issue as well.
They also think about it as an ethical 

1392
01:03:20,571 --> 01:03:21,720
and moral issue.
You know,

1393
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:22,850
they'll say,
look,

1394
01:03:22,851 --> 01:03:24,590
I don't want to be a part of factory 
farming.

1395
01:03:24,591 --> 01:03:26,720
I don't want to have anything to do with
the death of animals,

1396
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:28,123
which I completely understand and I,
I respect and appreciate what they're 

1397
01:03:32,811 --> 01:03:37,190
doing is they're trying to leave a 
smaller footprint on the world.

1398
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:38,940
No,
that makes sense too.

1399
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:40,790
Well,
I can see that because I,

1400
01:03:40,791 --> 01:03:41,624
I mean,
I don't think that animal cruelty is a 

1401
01:03:42,781 --> 01:03:45,810
good thing and I think animals should be
humanely slaughtered and kept.

1402
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,930
And so I think that that's a really good
argument.

1403
01:03:48,931 --> 01:03:51,060
I have friends who are vegetarians for 
that reason,

1404
01:03:51,061 --> 01:03:56,061
who know about eating meat and and being
a healthier way to,

1405
01:03:56,850 --> 01:03:57,683
to have a diet,
but they choose to make that tradeoff 

1406
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,530
and as long as you're making a choice,
a reason choice and you know what you're

1407
01:04:04,531 --> 01:04:06,570
trading off,
then I'm fine with that.

1408
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:07,651
Yeah.
No,

1409
01:04:07,651 --> 01:04:09,540
I think that's.
And again,

1410
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:10,613
for some people vegetarians probably the
way to go and that's what gets really 

1411
01:04:12,631 --> 01:04:13,464
confusing.
It's like how do you figure out what is 

1412
01:04:15,061 --> 01:04:17,250
the right way to go and what is the for 
you,

1413
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,330
I mean,
you really,

1414
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:20,220
what you're supposed to do is get blood 
tests.

1415
01:04:20,221 --> 01:04:21,870
You're supposed to do it on a regular 
basis.

1416
01:04:21,871 --> 01:04:22,704
Supposed to consult with someone who 
actually knows what they're talking 

1417
01:04:24,271 --> 01:04:24,990
about.
Yeah.

1418
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:29,990
And really just sort of um,
just make these choices,

1419
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:34,350
test the results,
and then make an educated decision based

1420
01:04:34,351 --> 01:04:34,940
on that.

1421
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:35,773
And here's a problem.
How do you find the evidence based 

1422
01:04:37,821 --> 01:04:38,654
doctor?
Because I'm in an Hmo so I can just 

1423
01:04:41,361 --> 01:04:44,630
switch doctors forever and ever,
but I just stay with the doctor and then

1424
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:47,870
read stuff myself because I can do that.
That's what I do for a living,

1425
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:48,943
um,
but for other people who aren't in an 

1426
01:04:50,091 --> 01:04:50,924
Hmo,
people want to find an evidence based 

1427
01:04:53,121 --> 01:04:55,430
medicine practitioner.
People will say they are,

1428
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:58,880
but then you hear the raw what they 
suggest and they really aren't.

1429
01:04:58,881 --> 01:04:59,714
And that's,
that's a really big problem would be 

1430
01:05:01,041 --> 01:05:01,874
great if there were somebody could make 
a lot of money maybe doing a site 

1431
01:05:03,771 --> 01:05:04,281
saying,
look,

1432
01:05:04,281 --> 01:05:06,950
I'm this doctor and here's what I look 
at and think.

1433
01:05:06,951 --> 01:05:07,784
And um,
so you could choose because we tried to 

1434
01:05:09,801 --> 01:05:12,950
find one for my boyfriend in Los Angeles
and like,

1435
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:14,900
no,
nobody knows.

1436
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,270
Right.
It's hard.

1437
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:17,160
Yeah.
It mean they're,

1438
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:18,040
they're out there,

1439
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,210
but it's hard to find them.

1440
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:21,490
Yeah,
because you tried five or six doctors.

1441
01:05:21,491 --> 01:05:23,470
You go through them and these are all 
doctor appointments.

1442
01:05:23,471 --> 01:05:25,180
You have to pay for them and everything 
and then you find,

1443
01:05:25,181 --> 01:05:26,014
okay.
You don't know anything really onto the 

1444
01:05:27,071 --> 01:05:27,904
next

1445
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:30,600
incredibly time consuming.
Like when I go to my doctor,

1446
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:34,770
when I get blood work done,
we have a 75 minute consultation.

1447
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:36,053
We have to sit down for 75 minutes and 
go over all the various micronutrient 

1448
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:41,940
levels.
And all the different levels of,

1449
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,730
you know,
everything nice and [inaudible] be like,

1450
01:05:44,731 --> 01:05:45,564
what?
And we go over diet and we go over like 

1451
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:49,620
when are you eating,
what time are you eating?

1452
01:05:49,621 --> 01:05:50,670
Like when,
when are you eating,

1453
01:05:50,671 --> 01:05:52,800
before you take the blood tests and you 
know,

1454
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:55,290
how much water are you consuming?
Red hydrated are you.

1455
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:56,573
And there's a lot going on me.
If you want to truly optimize your 

1456
01:05:59,461 --> 01:06:01,560
health,
it's better than ever,

1457
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:05,010
but still extremely hard to find someone
who knows what they're doing.

1458
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:05,923
Let's see.
So the doctor you go to that seems like 

1459
01:06:08,181 --> 01:06:09,014
a smart if you are going to spend money 
because that guy's probably really 

1460
01:06:10,971 --> 01:06:13,250
expensive,
but if you're going to spend money,

1461
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,770
you know,
a doctor who sees you for 72 minutes and

1462
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:17,390
looks at you,
looks at you that way.

1463
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,330
That seems like a really wise investment
in your future.

1464
01:06:20,331 --> 01:06:22,460
Even if you're maybe somebody who is 
not,

1465
01:06:22,461 --> 01:06:24,890
doesn't have money to burn.
And that,

1466
01:06:24,891 --> 01:06:26,810
that seems a really smart place to put 
it.

1467
01:06:26,811 --> 01:06:29,420
If you,
even if you have to make some sacrifices

1468
01:06:29,421 --> 01:06:30,260
in other areas.

1469
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:30,791
Yeah.
No,

1470
01:06:30,791 --> 01:06:31,624
I think so too.
And I think read as much as you can 

1471
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:37,000
about not just read books by people on 
nutrition,

1472
01:06:37,001 --> 01:06:40,380
but read articles about those books,
you know,

1473
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:41,273
read,
I mean pro and con and I've read a lot 

1474
01:06:43,751 --> 01:06:44,584
of con and you know,
you've got to go over that stuff with a 

1475
01:06:46,271 --> 01:06:48,060
fine tooth comb.
Look for bias,

1476
01:06:48,061 --> 01:06:49,220
look.
And it's hard to do.

1477
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:50,370
It's hard.
It's really hard to do.

1478
01:06:50,371 --> 01:06:52,980
Some of the important things are to look
at the sample size,

1479
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:54,090
look at people,
look,

1480
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:56,670
look the limitations.
Sometimes they'll say them at the end.

1481
01:06:56,671 --> 01:06:59,550
I always liked those studies that do 
that sample size,

1482
01:06:59,551 --> 01:07:00,384
you know,
when somebody has had 22 people in this 

1483
01:07:02,071 --> 01:07:03,110
study,
you know,

1484
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:04,680
that's not the one you want.
Look for,

1485
01:07:04,681 --> 01:07:06,900
you know,
and you can't just save necessarily,

1486
01:07:06,901 --> 01:07:08,520
oh it must be this number or that 
number.

1487
01:07:08,521 --> 01:07:11,790
But look for a lot of people.
And what else?

1488
01:07:11,791 --> 01:07:13,800
Like if they say something's really 
significant,

1489
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:15,870
then I'm always,
I'm immediately suspicious.

1490
01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:18,180
Significance,
you know,

1491
01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:19,023
well there's this whole argument about p
values and that's probability measure 

1492
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:25,080
that's going on now and we'll okay,
let's take that.

1493
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:25,953
Some people are saying,
let's take that out of the equation and 

1494
01:07:28,141 --> 01:07:31,830
because that's people are using this as 
this sort of golden thing to say,

1495
01:07:31,831 --> 01:07:32,664
okay,
we had the spiny and it's fantastic and 

1496
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:39,150
to look at him to look at the,
the,

1497
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:40,173
the,
the whole study and the findings in a 

1498
01:07:41,371 --> 01:07:44,400
more nuanced way than just the p value.

1499
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:46,053
It's hard for people.
I mean one of the things that we've 

1500
01:07:47,171 --> 01:07:48,004
talked about a couple of times recently 
that people keep throwing around is 

1501
01:07:49,991 --> 01:07:50,824
this.
These are the recent studies that show 

1502
01:07:52,211 --> 01:07:53,044
that people who eat a lot of red meat 
are more likely to get cancer and the 

1503
01:07:56,591 --> 01:07:58,960
issue with these studies is a bunch of 
issues.

1504
01:07:58,961 --> 01:07:59,794
One,
they don't differentiate what kind of 

1505
01:08:00,761 --> 01:08:01,594
meat.
They don't differentiate whether or not 

1506
01:08:02,441 --> 01:08:03,274
you eat it with vegetables or whether 
you eat it with white bread and 

1507
01:08:05,891 --> 01:08:10,891
spaghetti and this huge,
whether you're eating grass fed bison or

1508
01:08:11,261 --> 01:08:12,094
whether they're eating some bullshit 
burger and you just saying you eat meet 

1509
01:08:15,561 --> 01:08:16,190
five times

1510
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:17,023
a week.
That doesn't show me what's in your 

1511
01:08:18,591 --> 01:08:19,424
diet.
These are called cohort studies and I 

1512
01:08:21,201 --> 01:08:22,034
call them if you see that cohort studies
or observational or population based 

1513
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:27,013
observational study,
I call them leap to conclusions after 

1514
01:08:29,391 --> 01:08:33,230
the fact and they're just like the the 
shit of studies,

1515
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:35,330
you know,
because did the person,

1516
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,410
you know,
like you're saying,

1517
01:08:36,411 --> 01:08:39,440
what caused this,
this thing that we're seeing,

1518
01:08:39,441 --> 01:08:40,420
okay,
they are there,

1519
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:41,630
you know,
have this effect.

1520
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:46,980
There are healthy foods and it's just,
it's such a,

1521
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:49,790
it's such a crappy way and you see it 
reported in the media,

1522
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:50,630
you know,
these,

1523
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:52,670
these articles that say,
oh my God,

1524
01:08:52,671 --> 01:08:55,970
everyone should never eat this type of 
food ever again.

1525
01:08:55,971 --> 01:08:58,850
It's terrible for you.
And it doesn't say that at all,

1526
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:02,210
but the reporters don't know that and 
they just don't even care.

1527
01:09:02,211 --> 01:09:03,044
It's just click a bunch of hits on their
article and you'll see articles like 

1528
01:09:06,981 --> 01:09:07,814
that that even in like really 
respectable publications that have this 

1529
01:09:10,041 --> 01:09:11,450
really attractive headline.

1530
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:13,910
And then you read the actual article 
itself,

1531
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:14,240
you're like,
wait,

1532
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,730
what are you basing this off?
It's really terrible.

1533
01:09:16,731 --> 01:09:19,340
And so that's the thing,
what you said to look at studies.

1534
01:09:19,341 --> 01:09:23,720
Look at the opposite,
the opposite point of view that's really

1535
01:09:23,721 --> 01:09:25,880
important to look at at,
um,

1536
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:28,160
it's just,
it's hard to read some of these studies.

1537
01:09:28,161 --> 01:09:31,250
I really appreciate researchers who,
right and clear language.

1538
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:34,130
I think that's more and more important 
as people can get studies.

1539
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:39,400
There's a site called sky hub where you 
can get studies that are protected,

1540
01:09:39,561 --> 01:09:42,020
that the,
that the journals don't let you get.

1541
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,320
Um,
and you can find them on professors.

1542
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:47,690
Websites are ways to find these studies 
if you want to find them.

1543
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,593
Um,
you can use google scholar to look up 

1544
01:09:50,031 --> 01:09:53,510
the thing.
So it's just a scholar.google.com.

1545
01:09:53,511 --> 01:09:56,780
And then you can start finding these in,
try to get them through other sources if

1546
01:09:56,781 --> 01:09:57,614
they are password protected because you 
don't want to just read the abstract 

1547
01:09:59,661 --> 01:10:02,780
because they can say the abstracts that 
part at the top where they tell you what

1548
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:03,580
the study's about,
oee,

1549
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:05,720
this significant finding and we found 
this and that.

1550
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,490
And you will often,
not often,

1551
01:10:07,491 --> 01:10:08,324
but you will sometimes read a study and 
you'll see that the thing that they say 

1552
01:10:11,331 --> 01:10:12,164
they found is not what they found.
And that's why it's important to not 

1553
01:10:15,111 --> 01:10:17,960
just be this lazy person who reads only 
the abstract and the conclusion,

1554
01:10:17,961 --> 01:10:20,600
but to look at the methodology and see 
if there's stuff screwed up.

1555
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:21,733
I saw a study done by Harvard professors
where they didn't have a control group 

1556
01:10:25,191 --> 01:10:27,230
for their third experiment.
And I thought,

1557
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,030
did you forget?
I mean,

1558
01:10:29,031 --> 01:10:31,130
you're at Harvard,
if you guys don't know,

1559
01:10:31,131 --> 01:10:33,020
to put in a control group,
you know,

1560
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:34,880
come on.
That's a study about,

1561
01:10:34,990 --> 01:10:36,740
um,
it was um,

1562
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,200
a study on,
um,

1563
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,150
God,
I'm not gonna remember now it was,

1564
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:44,180
um,
mm shoot.

1565
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:47,810
It was the third part was in a train 
station and I can't,

1566
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,160
I can't remember what the study was 
about.

1567
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:49,993
I just,
I brought it with me in an evolutionary 

1568
01:10:50,841 --> 01:10:51,674
psychology conference thing,
thinking this will be east or write a 

1569
01:10:53,571 --> 01:10:54,404
column from.
Because I had a question that kind of 

1570
01:10:55,071 --> 01:10:56,420
matched,
um,

1571
01:10:56,990 --> 01:10:57,823
I can't remember,
but it was in a train station and they 

1572
01:10:59,330 --> 01:11:01,520
should have gotten done in a train.
They did two,

1573
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:02,413
two of the experiments.
The first two experiments were where 

1574
01:11:04,821 --> 01:11:07,880
they played videos or something.
I think it had something to do with cell

1575
01:11:07,881 --> 01:11:09,740
phones or something.
I can't quite remember.

1576
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:12,020
It was someone trying to borrow a cell 
phone,

1577
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:16,560
someone can we borrow your cell phone 
and so and,

1578
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:18,570
and I like these professors.
I've referenced one of their,

1579
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,550
both of their work in my book,
my next book,

1580
01:11:20,551 --> 01:11:22,460
but I'm a psychologist.
Study.

1581
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:23,303
Yeah.
It was social psychology study and I 

1582
01:11:24,931 --> 01:11:25,764
thought,
you know that why don't you have a 

1583
01:11:26,551 --> 01:11:29,910
control for third through third 
experiment.

1584
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:33,120
And so then I had to do a new question 
for my second question,

1585
01:11:33,121 --> 01:11:35,700
my column and I was all annoyed too so I
remembered it.

1586
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:41,120
Well there's a difference between 
science and then headlines from articles

1587
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:43,253
that are written about science by people
that might not even necessarily be 

1588
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:48,570
scientists or really truly understand 
the science.

1589
01:11:48,571 --> 01:11:49,404
They just want to get an article out 
there that people are going to pay 

1590
01:11:50,971 --> 01:11:52,080
attention to.
Well I'm,

1591
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,033
I'm sensitive to credentialism is I 
don't have a phd and I started out 

1592
01:11:55,591 --> 01:11:58,050
giving free advice in a street corner 
and Soho is a joke.

1593
01:11:58,051 --> 01:11:59,160
So.
But I've.

1594
01:11:59,161 --> 01:12:02,030
Since then I started out giving advice 
on a street corner,

1595
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,000
a little wacky,
broad.

1596
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:04,103
So what we doing?
Well we just had these two friends and 

1597
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:08,393
we just thought it would be funny.
So we set up on the corner of West 

1598
01:12:10,021 --> 01:12:13,680
Broadway and broom with a card table and
some folding chairs that advice,

1599
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:16,050
it said free advice from a panel of 
experts.

1600
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:18,990
We've called the advice ladies and like 
love and dating and you know,

1601
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:20,250
when,
what year did you do?

1602
01:12:20,251 --> 01:12:22,080
This?
Was in the late eighties.

1603
01:12:22,081 --> 01:12:25,230
And then in the nineties he just decided
to do this on a whim.

1604
01:12:25,630 --> 01:12:27,000
Well,
we thought we'd just do it once.

1605
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:30,590
I act like I'm drunk at all times.
So No,

1606
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:31,433
I'm just a weird person and we did this 
and we just thought we'd sit there and 

1607
01:12:33,961 --> 01:12:36,750
people walk past and laugh because I 
always liked making people laugh.

1608
01:12:36,751 --> 01:12:39,360
I once went out in an evening dress and 
a goatee and a mustache.

1609
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:42,570
I'm just to be funny.
I frightened to child.

1610
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:44,280
Um,
and uh,

1611
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,590
we did this and people,
it was New York,

1612
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:47,443
you know,
free.

1613
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:50,700
They lined up around the block and they 
didn't just ask us like about like their

1614
01:12:50,701 --> 01:12:51,990
eyelashes or whatever,
like,

1615
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,780
can I get directions to grand street,
Grand Street?

1616
01:12:54,781 --> 01:12:56,790
They were asking a serious question and 
I thought,

1617
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,620
Holy Shit,
I better know something.

1618
01:12:58,620 --> 01:12:59,453
And so I read through all of psychology 
and when you're not reading psychology 

1619
01:13:02,431 --> 01:13:03,770
in school,
you think like,

1620
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,970
oh my God,
Freud just made shit up.

1621
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,490
It was really crazy.
And I discovered this guy,

1622
01:13:08,491 --> 01:13:09,324
Albert Ellis,
who was the father at the same time as 

1623
01:13:11,071 --> 01:13:12,550
Erin back of,
um,

1624
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:13,493
cognitive behavioral therapy basically,
and then started reading more and more 

1625
01:13:16,951 --> 01:13:17,784
and immersing myself more and more in 
science and going to scientific 

1626
01:13:20,221 --> 01:13:23,640
conferences.
And then because this thing where I look

1627
01:13:23,641 --> 01:13:25,590
for people to criticize me so I can get 
better.

1628
01:13:25,591 --> 01:13:26,820
I mean not the people who are like,
Hey,

1629
01:13:26,821 --> 01:13:28,530
horror on the internet.
But um,

1630
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:30,900
I would ask professors like,
did I get this wrong?

1631
01:13:30,901 --> 01:13:31,734
And sometimes they'd say yes.
And so I learned more and more and got 

1632
01:13:34,651 --> 01:13:36,990
better and better and incorporated more 
science.

1633
01:13:36,991 --> 01:13:39,870
So now what I do is sort of a synthesis 
from across science.

1634
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:44,220
I read a cognitive neuroscience textbook
and I use evolutionary psychology.

1635
01:13:44,221 --> 01:13:47,490
I used that as sort of an underpinning 
theory to everything.

1636
01:13:47,491 --> 01:13:49,380
So I look at social science research and
say,

1637
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:52,410
how would this have made sense in an 
ancestral environment?

1638
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,720
Because if it,
if there's no sense to it,

1639
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:55,583
then there's something empty and wrong 
with what they're finding or what 

1640
01:13:58,621 --> 01:14:03,390
they're concluding now.
So you started out doing this,

1641
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:04,224
you set up this card table and free 
advice and then how did it progress to 

1642
01:14:08,431 --> 01:14:10,530
you having this column?
Well,

1643
01:14:10,531 --> 01:14:11,364
um,
so we're doing this and just because it 

1644
01:14:12,731 --> 01:14:15,670
was so fun and we got so much out of it 
and I learned this,

1645
01:14:15,671 --> 01:14:16,504
that basically if you help people,
if you do kindness to other people for 

1646
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:21,580
other people,
you feel really good.

1647
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:25,000
So there's self interest in being kind,
especially to strangers.

1648
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:27,010
So,
and that's what we were doing.

1649
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:28,300
And so,
um,

1650
01:14:28,301 --> 01:14:30,760
we did this for a few years and sky 
walked by,

1651
01:14:30,761 --> 01:14:32,680
he wrote for The New York Times style 
section.

1652
01:14:32,681 --> 01:14:34,250
He belittled teeny piece on us,
like,

1653
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:36,160
and then it got old cut down Eric 
Messenger.

1654
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:39,310
And then because I'm a governmental Jew,
I do like five things well,

1655
01:14:39,311 --> 01:14:41,170
and one of them selling things.
So what does that mean?

1656
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:42,700
That means like you're in the garment 
district,

1657
01:14:42,701 --> 01:14:46,000
you're like hocking clothing.
So I can like get dressed.

1658
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:47,440
Notice I don't say like,
you know,

1659
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:48,670
I get dressed,
eat,

1660
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:50,360
not cook.
Um,

1661
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:51,213
what else?
Anyway,

1662
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:52,780
psychology,
that's one of them.

1663
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:56,080
And then selling things.
And so I got us a TV deal with Deniro,

1664
01:14:56,081 --> 01:14:58,600
my partners and me.
And then I got us a column,

1665
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:01,720
the Daily News and a book agent.
And one of my partners ended up dying.

1666
01:15:01,721 --> 01:15:03,080
It's very sad.
Um,

1667
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:05,760
and so we,
um,

1668
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:09,640
I ended up doing the column myself at 
that point,

1669
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:10,713
um,
and then just syndicated my own column 

1670
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:14,740
because I thought,
well,

1671
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,050
you know,
I'm writing this for one paper,

1672
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:18,490
don't make very much money,
how do I make more money?

1673
01:15:18,490 --> 01:15:19,323
And I was an entrepreneur and so I got 
it in a whole bunch of papers even 

1674
01:15:21,521 --> 01:15:23,800
though all the syndicators who do that.
And,

1675
01:15:23,801 --> 01:15:25,170
and by the way,
if anyone asks,

1676
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:27,640
it's not possible anymore.
Papers are all going out of business.

1677
01:15:27,641 --> 01:15:29,340
But true,
previous,

1678
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:30,370
true,
be there,

1679
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:32,290
they're very,
they're really struggling.

1680
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:35,050
But back then I went to syndicators.
They said,

1681
01:15:35,051 --> 01:15:35,884
yeah,
we think you write a really great 

1682
01:15:36,371 --> 01:15:37,450
column,
but Ann Landers,

1683
01:15:37,490 --> 01:15:38,800
dear abby,
of all the real estate,

1684
01:15:38,801 --> 01:15:39,634
you'll never make any money.
And so I went to an alternative weekly 

1685
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:44,980
newspaper conference in Montreal.
I didn't like the Hooker hotel because I

1686
01:15:44,981 --> 01:15:47,290
couldn't afford the real hotel.
And I just went around saying like,

1687
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:49,720
here are my little samples here,
my little samples.

1688
01:15:49,721 --> 01:15:51,640
And so paper started picking up my 
column.

1689
01:15:51,641 --> 01:15:55,360
So I built a business out of doing this,
this out of free advice.

1690
01:15:55,361 --> 01:15:59,350
And then over the years became 
increasingly science based,

1691
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:01,390
you know,
had to learn statistics.

1692
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:04,120
I have a book I weep reading under my 
desk,

1693
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:06,340
biosis biostatistics,
the bare essentials.

1694
01:16:06,341 --> 01:16:07,174
I read a lot of stats websites and try 
to improve in that area in terms of 

1695
01:16:12,341 --> 01:16:16,540
scientific thinking and,
and understanding statistics.

1696
01:16:16,541 --> 01:16:20,770
So I can be better at assessing studies.
People gravitate towards advice.

1697
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:21,693
They really do the advice columns and 
advice like call in advice shows like 

1698
01:16:25,961 --> 01:16:27,550
people love,
like Dr Laura,

1699
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:29,780
like that kind of shit.
People call on,

1700
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:31,150
you know,
what should I do,

1701
01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:33,160
what should I do?
Well,

1702
01:16:33,161 --> 01:16:34,760
the thing that I do,
I,

1703
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,570
I just feel like I don't have a right to
just give you my opinion.

1704
01:16:37,571 --> 01:16:40,630
Right.
So before it was a science base was very

1705
01:16:40,631 --> 01:16:41,464
reasoned based.
I always loved critical thinking and 

1706
01:16:42,941 --> 01:16:46,100
reasoning and logic.
And so now you know,

1707
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:49,210
I'll look at somebodies question and 
I'll sometimes think I know the answer,

1708
01:16:49,211 --> 01:16:50,770
but I'll always read to see.

1709
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:52,900
Oh actually no,
it's this.

1710
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:54,033
I'll read a bunch of papers and I look 
for what's called the most parsimonious 

1711
01:16:56,231 --> 01:16:58,900
answer because there can be a bunch of 
answers to something,

1712
01:16:58,901 --> 01:16:59,734
but it's like what is the thing that 
most closely narrowly answers this 

1713
01:17:03,551 --> 01:17:06,250
person's question?
And then also there's this thing,

1714
01:17:06,251 --> 01:17:07,084
I see advice columns all the time.
They tell someone to do something that 

1715
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:10,093
nobody would ever do.
So I always have like this sort of 

1716
01:17:11,901 --> 01:17:13,700
bullshit check on there of like,
come on,

1717
01:17:13,701 --> 01:17:15,980
it's anybody ever going to do this kind 
of stuff?

1718
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:18,790
Well it's like write stuff down.
I write stuff down.

1719
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:19,940
Well you know,
you might do it.

1720
01:17:19,941 --> 01:17:22,190
And when people read those books,
self help books,

1721
01:17:22,191 --> 01:17:23,024
it says located okay,
right this worksheet and do all this 

1722
01:17:24,771 --> 01:17:26,870
stuff.
I've never done that my whole life.

1723
01:17:26,930 --> 01:17:28,570
And so write things down.
No.

1724
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:31,310
Well,
do you have like a list of things to do?

1725
01:17:31,420 --> 01:17:33,050
I know I have,
I have stuff written.

1726
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,033
My house is like a,
it's a fire hazard with a bed in an 

1727
01:17:35,991 --> 01:17:39,080
oven.
It's like a walk in paper pile.

1728
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:42,020
So now I write everything down.
Actually I type everything out.

1729
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:44,780
I,
I'm a blowhard and in print.

1730
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:47,480
Um,
but the thing is that in books,

1731
01:17:47,481 --> 01:17:49,250
when they say,
fill out this worksheet,

1732
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:52,040
I like reading,
I don't want to stop and do this thing.

1733
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:55,100
And so I've never done that.
And so in this next book that I wrote,

1734
01:17:55,101 --> 01:17:57,610
I have two ways to do some delays.
Yes.

1735
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:58,453
Amy Elk on way or the way that's 
actually more efficient and will do 

1736
01:18:01,161 --> 01:18:01,994
better.
It's the way I changed because I was 

1737
01:18:03,001 --> 01:18:06,440
this loser with no confidence and I 
transformed myself.

1738
01:18:06,530 --> 01:18:08,750
And actually it's based in good science.
What I did,

1739
01:18:08,751 --> 01:18:11,060
I didn't know that I was just desperate 
and miserable.

1740
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:12,290
But I say,
look,

1741
01:18:12,291 --> 01:18:15,440
if you make a list of these problems 
that you have,

1742
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:17,480
the things you're afraid of,
this will help you,

1743
01:18:17,481 --> 01:18:19,100
then you can tackle them.
This is smarter,

1744
01:18:19,101 --> 01:18:20,450
but I didn't do that.
I still,

1745
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,040
you know,
got to where I needed to go,

1746
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:26,360
but it's just dumb to do it my way 
because you can just do a little writing

1747
01:18:26,361 --> 01:18:30,380
work and get to um,
tackle this stuff you need to tackle,

1748
01:18:30,990 --> 01:18:35,040
give advice that you don't really take.
So like saying like take,

1749
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:35,933
write down all the different things that
you have issue with and then you can 

1750
01:18:38,701 --> 01:18:40,110
tackle those.
You didn't really do that

1751
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,120
well because I didn't do it based in 
science.

1752
01:18:42,121 --> 01:18:42,954
What I'm saying is that I recognize that
some people will be too lazy to write 

1753
01:18:46,051 --> 01:18:49,770
stuff down or they just don't do that.
And so what I did is I said,

1754
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:52,190
here are the consequences if you do it 
my way,

1755
01:18:52,191 --> 01:18:54,360
like it's going to be slower and you 
know,

1756
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:58,230
you might not be as successful.
And this way it seems worthwhile.

1757
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:00,240
Like if I could do this over again,
if I,

1758
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:02,370
if I had a time machine and go back and 
say like,

1759
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:04,590
Hey,
miserable losers person,

1760
01:19:05,190 --> 01:19:09,360
here's what you do and write this down 
because then it's going to take you this

1761
01:19:09,361 --> 01:19:11,520
many years instead of like that many 
years.

1762
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:12,683
I would do that now.
And so what I tried to do is persuade 

1763
01:19:14,491 --> 01:19:17,040
people to be smarter than I was 
basically.

1764
01:19:17,110 --> 01:19:17,740
Well,
you're,

1765
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:18,573
you're

1766
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:21,460
giving advice based on your personal 
experience.

1767
01:19:21,461 --> 01:19:22,420
Like this would have been a better way 
to.

1768
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,420
Right?
This is a better way.

1769
01:19:24,450 --> 01:19:28,380
And I see that based on the science,
but I realized that some people won't do

1770
01:19:28,381 --> 01:19:30,180
it.
So you can choose.

1771
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:32,010
This is the thing.
It's like with the Diet,

1772
01:19:32,011 --> 01:19:33,540
okay,
you eat that cupcake,

1773
01:19:33,541 --> 01:19:35,550
you're going to enjoy it,
but here's the trade off.

1774
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:36,860
Well,
writing things down.

1775
01:19:36,861 --> 01:19:37,694
One of the things that's important about
that is it cements those things in your 

1776
01:19:40,671 --> 01:19:44,810
memory and it puts them in,
especially in my opinion,

1777
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:49,020
physically writing.
I don't know why but like for notes like

1778
01:19:49,021 --> 01:19:49,854
um,
I have notes on my phone that I keep 

1779
01:19:51,351 --> 01:19:53,690
from like comedy sets of like things 
that I need to do,

1780
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:57,290
but they're not as effective as a 
notebook.

1781
01:19:57,320 --> 01:20:00,650
I keep a notebook as well and my 
notebook is not where I write in.

1782
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:01,513
I ride on a computer,
but my notebook is where I write things 

1783
01:20:04,671 --> 01:20:05,504
down that I need to remember like this,
the subject of bits and the important 

1784
01:20:09,931 --> 01:20:12,660
points in bits and maybe even if it's a 
new bit,

1785
01:20:12,661 --> 01:20:16,920
I'll go over the important punchlines 
and where they fit in and I'll write all

1786
01:20:16,921 --> 01:20:18,300
this stuff out.
But that way,

1787
01:20:18,301 --> 01:20:21,630
like for some reason when you physically
write things down,

1788
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:22,493
they get cemented in your mind.
The act of putting pen to paper and 

1789
01:20:26,641 --> 01:20:28,050
moving your hand around

1790
01:20:28,270 --> 01:20:28,950
it makes sense.
See,

1791
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:30,970
this is the,
this is the subject of my next book.

1792
01:20:30,971 --> 01:20:31,804
It's embodied cognition.
It's that we don't just think with our 

1793
01:20:34,421 --> 01:20:37,930
mind that our body is intimately 
involved and so.

1794
01:20:37,931 --> 01:20:42,220
And there is research that finds you are
actually going to remember stuff more if

1795
01:20:42,221 --> 01:20:43,054
you write it down.
That's why they say in class you should 

1796
01:20:44,501 --> 01:20:47,380
take notes in pen and ink rather than 
typing.

1797
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:48,910
And so the truth is,
I mean,

1798
01:20:48,911 --> 01:20:52,840
I've lived all over my house.
It's just that self help book genre that

1799
01:20:52,841 --> 01:20:55,210
I never wrote anything in where they 
said to write stuff,

1800
01:20:55,570 --> 01:20:59,590
but I think that that's very important 
and also for memorization,

1801
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:00,820
um,
that,

1802
01:21:00,821 --> 01:21:01,654
that's,
that's an important thing that to write 

1803
01:21:02,681 --> 01:21:03,514
stuff when I have,
I did a Ted talk and I had to memorize 

1804
01:21:05,981 --> 01:21:10,000
stuff for it and I can see where I wrote
stuff on the pages.

1805
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:11,013
So I had the type pages.
But then I had stuff where I scratched 

1806
01:21:12,761 --> 01:21:15,700
and notes and I can picture that still.
Even now,

1807
01:21:15,701 --> 01:21:17,170
even though I don't have the greatest 
memory,

1808
01:21:17,171 --> 01:21:21,250
I don't think the places that I wrote 
notes in this colored ink,

1809
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:26,110
there's something very memorable about 
that where it isn't with the type page.

1810
01:21:27,670 --> 01:21:29,110
Yeah.
I don't know what it is,

1811
01:21:29,111 --> 01:21:30,490
but it definitely works.
Right.

1812
01:21:30,590 --> 01:21:32,360
Well,
the physical is very important.

1813
01:21:32,361 --> 01:21:34,400
You know,
if you look at people who are,

1814
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:37,490
you know,
feel bad about themselves,

1815
01:21:37,491 --> 01:21:39,800
they sort of hunched down and 
everything.

1816
01:21:39,801 --> 01:21:40,634
There's a different way of standing if 
you feel good about yourself and good 

1817
01:21:43,581 --> 01:21:46,730
about where you're going and walking 
going forward.

1818
01:21:46,731 --> 01:21:48,260
I mean all of these things are very 
important.

1819
01:21:48,261 --> 01:21:49,094
If you are depressed,
it really can help to take a walk and 

1820
01:21:50,991 --> 01:21:53,360
this is this kind of thing where you 
have to force yourself.

1821
01:21:53,390 --> 01:21:55,520
It's like when I forced myself to get on
the bike,

1822
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:57,590
you know,
I want to do anything but that,

1823
01:21:57,591 --> 01:22:00,890
but I know that I just have to do it 
because I'll feel so much better.

1824
01:22:01,130 --> 01:22:03,890
Not just then,
but the next day it seems to,

1825
01:22:03,891 --> 01:22:06,610
I see an effect on mood the next day,
you know,

1826
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:11,360
with this thing in Vegas,
I got very just in a dark place that did

1827
01:22:11,361 --> 01:22:15,380
that day that happened and I just made 
myself get on the bike and it's the time

1828
01:22:15,381 --> 01:22:16,214
I've felt least like that.
And I mean like how dumb because all 

1829
01:22:17,931 --> 01:22:19,550
these people are going through this 
horrible stuff.

1830
01:22:19,551 --> 01:22:20,001
And I'm like,
oh,

1831
01:22:20,001 --> 01:22:21,740
I couldn't get on a bicycle.
But.

1832
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:24,770
But it really is.
You have your own little world.

1833
01:22:24,771 --> 01:22:26,960
That's where you inhabit and you have to
take care of it.

1834
01:22:26,961 --> 01:22:31,961
And that was what I did to just not.
I didn't want to go into a depression.

1835
01:22:32,410 --> 01:22:34,780
Well,
it's also a habit that's a good habit to

1836
01:22:34,781 --> 01:22:39,781
form the habit of getting too off your 
ass and putting action,

1837
01:22:40,730 --> 01:22:41,563
doing something right.
And sometimes it's hard for people that 

1838
01:22:43,631 --> 01:22:45,010
you know,
you can call it procrastinating.

1839
01:22:45,011 --> 01:22:46,840
I saw,
I don't want to do or to think about not

1840
01:22:46,841 --> 01:22:47,674
doing it.
You have to get in the habit of just 

1841
01:22:49,031 --> 01:22:49,864
doing things,
getting the habit of getting up and 

1842
01:22:51,130 --> 01:22:52,990
doing where there's.
There's no option.

1843
01:22:52,991 --> 01:22:55,570
You don't have the option to not do it.
Force yourself to do it.

1844
01:22:55,571 --> 01:22:56,404
And if you can do that,
you will appreciate your free time so 

1845
01:22:59,201 --> 01:23:01,890
much more.
If you people think that like,

1846
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:05,170
well I just like being lazy and I like 
relaxing,

1847
01:23:05,490 --> 01:23:06,190
sitting around

1848
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,150
you.
You May,

1849
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:08,103
I believe you may,
but you won't like it as much as you 

1850
01:23:10,871 --> 01:23:13,030
would like it if you've accomplished 
your goals first.

1851
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:13,893
See are so great.
Because then you feel good about 

1852
01:23:15,071 --> 01:23:16,310
something.
You've done something,

1853
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:18,630
you feel good sitting on the couch.
I like sitting on the couch.

1854
01:23:18,631 --> 01:23:21,670
Sometimes I'm watching TV,
but it's because I work so much,

1855
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:25,150
I get shit done.
So when I put my feet up I can like,

1856
01:23:25,151 --> 01:23:26,680
feel good.
I'm not fucking off.

1857
01:23:26,681 --> 01:23:29,980
I'm enjoying leisure time,
which is also important.

1858
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:31,023
There's this classic social science 
research by this Guy Carl Wyke who 

1859
01:23:33,431 --> 01:23:34,264
talked about small wins and that's 
really important and they talk about 

1860
01:23:37,241 --> 01:23:40,010
that in a make your bed in the morning 
and,

1861
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:41,890
and the thing you were talking about 
with feelings,

1862
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:45,430
I'm a big advocate of not letting your 
feelings be the boss of you.

1863
01:23:45,431 --> 01:23:46,270
That's how I say it.

1864
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:48,160
Um,
and so for example,

1865
01:23:48,161 --> 01:23:51,280
I write to a timer because when I sit 
down to write,

1866
01:23:51,281 --> 01:23:54,610
so my stuff is funny.
So I always think like I'm not funny,

1867
01:23:54,611 --> 01:23:56,340
I have nothing to say.
I don't know what the science,

1868
01:23:56,410 --> 01:23:57,490
I don't know what the answer is.
That's,

1869
01:23:57,491 --> 01:23:58,324
those are those immediate feelings 
buzzing around like little flies and my 

1870
01:24:00,641 --> 01:24:03,460
head and it doesn't,
none of that matters because the time,

1871
01:24:03,461 --> 01:24:04,294
right?
Put on 52 minutes on 17 minutes break 

1872
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:09,120
and that's all that matters.
How many times do you read a day?

1873
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:11,230
Um,
uh,

1874
01:24:11,231 --> 01:24:14,500
it depends on the day because sometimes 
there's 17 minutes for break.

1875
01:24:14,530 --> 01:24:16,000
Well do that.
And I do.

1876
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:17,160
Dean,
how'd you come to that?

1877
01:24:17,161 --> 01:24:18,250
Actually,
I read something,

1878
01:24:18,251 --> 01:24:19,630
I didn't even read this study.
It just,

1879
01:24:19,631 --> 01:24:20,830
I thought,
oh that sounds good.

1880
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:23,530
There's this thing called a pomodoro 
where you do 20 minutes,

1881
01:24:23,531 --> 01:24:25,390
but that doesn't seem like very much,
you know,

1882
01:24:25,450 --> 01:24:26,283
with the humorous stuff sometimes if 
it's hard I have to just keep shooting 

1883
01:24:28,271 --> 01:24:31,210
the shit with myself and like looking up
things on the internet like oh look,

1884
01:24:31,211 --> 01:24:32,140
a polar bear,
okay.

1885
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:33,373
And,
and come up with some kind of joke or 

1886
01:24:34,421 --> 01:24:36,430
something like that.
And so it takes a while.

1887
01:24:36,730 --> 01:24:39,280
And I read this somewhere saying that 50
to 17,

1888
01:24:39,281 --> 01:24:42,540
but I didn't even read the paper on it.
I didn't just run with that.

1889
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:43,510
Right.
We'll run with that.

1890
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:47,500
And so what I do often in the 17 minute 
break period,

1891
01:24:47,501 --> 01:24:50,490
especially if I'm doing something really
hard is um,

1892
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:53,470
I will clean my house and I,
I wish I could,

1893
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,030
you know,
no one pays writers anymore.

1894
01:24:55,031 --> 01:24:57,160
So I'd actually like to have a team of 
maids and a butler,

1895
01:24:57,161 --> 01:24:58,380
a little midget butler,
I don't know,

1896
01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:01,420
for Nola to save.
Oh,

1897
01:25:01,490 --> 01:25:02,840
okay.
A little person.

1898
01:25:02,841 --> 01:25:04,120
Sorry,
little person Butler.

1899
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:05,620
Why a little person?
How about a giant?

1900
01:25:05,710 --> 01:25:09,160
Because I always love the wizard of Oz.
I think that they're amazing looking.

1901
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:10,103
Um,
so that's probably a terrible thing and 

1902
01:25:12,011 --> 01:25:12,950
I'm probably going to be happy.

1903
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:14,730
You have people like come after me and 
the,

1904
01:25:14,770 --> 01:25:16,250
what does this champion would just pull 
up?

1905
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:17,643
Pomodoro is,
I've only heard of it and a time 

1906
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:21,040
cooking.
So yeah,

1907
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:22,790
right,
right.

1908
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:25,810
It comes out of that little,
the little tomato timer.

1909
01:25:25,811 --> 01:25:26,644
It's 20 minutes.
So each 25 minute block of work as a 

1910
01:25:28,571 --> 01:25:29,404
Pomodoro.
Once you thought it was 24 pomodoros 

1911
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:32,673
take a longer break of 20 to 30 minutes.
This will help your brain relax and 

1912
01:25:35,591 --> 01:25:36,424
refocus before your next session.
So this is default mode processing that 

1913
01:25:39,761 --> 01:25:42,160
goes on.
What happens is you're more efficient if

1914
01:25:42,161 --> 01:25:42,994
you take breaks.
See I'm from the family of the puritan 

1915
01:25:45,401 --> 01:25:46,650
work ethic.
Jews of like,

1916
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:47,723
you know,
the just the beat the horse and have it 

1917
01:25:48,941 --> 01:25:49,774
worked for hours,
but that's really inefficient because 

1918
01:25:51,491 --> 01:25:55,030
your brain does background processing 
while you're doing this,

1919
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:55,893
you know,
you're washing the dishes or whatever 

1920
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:58,113
and so,
but I find that the thing about not 

1921
01:25:59,741 --> 01:26:01,480
having a maid and doing the work 
yourself,

1922
01:26:01,481 --> 01:26:03,980
you like cleaned the base board down 
here or take the little

1923
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:04,813
clorox wipe and do something.
You have these small wins so you 

1924
01:26:07,161 --> 01:26:10,100
accomplished something even though it's 
just a little tiny thing.

1925
01:26:10,101 --> 01:26:10,934
You clean your countertop or whatever 
with bleach that you've done something 

1926
01:26:13,971 --> 01:26:15,920
and where maybe you're writing,
it's going,

1927
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:18,110
it's frustrating and you haven't really 
accomplished much.

1928
01:26:18,111 --> 01:26:20,240
He didn't figure out the thing you 
needed to figure out.

1929
01:26:20,570 --> 01:26:23,360
So you have that elevated feeling of 
being,

1930
01:26:23,610 --> 01:26:25,670
having done something that you're 
talking about.

1931
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:26,983
I've heard a lot of people say they like
to take breaks and walk during the 

1932
01:26:30,741 --> 01:26:31,574
walking.
That's when they sort of sort out all 

1933
01:26:32,991 --> 01:26:33,824
the different things they were writing 
about and they usually bring a phone or 

1934
01:26:36,271 --> 01:26:37,104
a recorder and then they talk into it if
they have an idea and then go over that 

1935
01:26:39,651 --> 01:26:40,870
or you know,
obviously.

1936
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:41,713
Do you use the transcription?
You have a smartphone use at 

1937
01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:46,010
transcriptional.
I that dragon thing on my phone,

1938
01:26:46,011 --> 01:26:46,844
which I really like.

1939
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:48,133
The walking does seem helpful.
Nietzsche walk and I've read papers on 

1940
01:26:51,441 --> 01:26:52,274
this that walking is helpful and so I do
that also if I have something that's 

1941
01:26:56,721 --> 01:26:57,554
just where I can't figure something out,
what I do is I go to the bank and get 

1942
01:27:00,201 --> 01:27:01,034
$20 out just to.
So it doesn't seem like a meaningless 

1943
01:27:03,501 --> 01:27:08,180
trip there and then come home and go to 
the bank to get 20 bucks really?

1944
01:27:08,210 --> 01:27:09,043
Well it's near my house.
It's like on Lincoln and I walked back 

1945
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:12,440
and you know,
it's a short trip,

1946
01:27:12,441 --> 01:27:16,790
but it's enough of a walk that it's a 
walk and a symbolic thing of getting the

1947
01:27:16,791 --> 01:27:19,460
money out if it has no meaning,
it's just that,

1948
01:27:19,461 --> 01:27:20,930
you know,
if I just walked to the bank,

1949
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:23,720
it would feel purposeless than then 
maybe I wouldn't do it the next time.

1950
01:27:23,721 --> 01:27:26,510
So it feels like I know I'm a weird 
girl,

1951
01:27:26,511 --> 01:27:27,344
what can I say?

1952
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:28,640
Um,
but I do that.

1953
01:27:28,641 --> 01:27:32,970
And that's just such a,
it's sort of alleviate some kind of debt

1954
01:27:32,990 --> 01:27:33,823
that pressing feeling of you have.
Like there's not a solution I don't 

1955
01:27:36,141 --> 01:27:37,670
know.
And you're moving,

1956
01:27:37,671 --> 01:27:39,350
you're doing this thing where you're 
moving forward.

1957
01:27:39,351 --> 01:27:41,270
That's this thing about your brain,
not just,

1958
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:42,253
we don't just think about solutions.
Like we can actually move in ways that 

1959
01:27:45,831 --> 01:27:46,664
help your brain be more powerful.
And that's that the walking thing that 

1960
01:27:51,291 --> 01:27:52,124
seems to be one of these ways where you 
take some pressure off and actually 

1961
01:27:56,571 --> 01:27:57,404
that.
And I put things on the wall in my 

1962
01:27:58,371 --> 01:28:00,440
shower,
correct things,

1963
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:04,190
and I also put up things I don't 
understand to look at them over and over

1964
01:28:04,191 --> 01:28:05,024
again.
And the other thing too is people feel 

1965
01:28:07,371 --> 01:28:12,140
bad if they are not instantly geniuses 
at figuring something out.

1966
01:28:12,141 --> 01:28:14,610
And what I like to do is go over and 
over and overthink.

1967
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:15,473
So on this thing that I'm writing now,
this medical care expo say that I'm 

1968
01:28:17,871 --> 01:28:18,704
writing now.
The research is really new to me and 

1969
01:28:20,991 --> 01:28:21,824
complicated.
And so what I do is I have a pile of 

1970
01:28:23,931 --> 01:28:25,970
papers.
There's a step stool in my bathroom.

1971
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:26,853
It's really crazy.
My boyfriend goes in there and he sort 

1972
01:28:28,191 --> 01:28:31,410
of frightened by the insanity but the 
pile of paper.

1973
01:28:31,411 --> 01:28:35,240
So I put them on the bottom stool and 
then I reread them and I put them on the

1974
01:28:35,241 --> 01:28:36,080
top.
So there's like a.

1975
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:39,020
it's like an escalator going back and 
forth.

1976
01:28:39,021 --> 01:28:39,854
Because when you do it like that,
you get sort of a deep understanding 

1977
01:28:42,291 --> 01:28:44,300
that you don't.
When you just read it at first.

1978
01:28:44,690 --> 01:28:47,750
And I know this from writing that 
there's an understanding I can listen to

1979
01:28:47,751 --> 01:28:51,260
somebody present their work at a 
scientific conference and understand it,

1980
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:52,363
but can I explain it to you?
And that's a whole different level of 

1981
01:28:54,411 --> 01:28:59,090
understanding that's deeper 
understanding that that does make sense.

1982
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:02,060
And when you're talking about walking to

1983
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:02,923
do,
what do you think the walking has an 

1984
01:29:03,751 --> 01:29:06,810
effect also because it's a mild,
very mild exercise,

1985
01:29:06,811 --> 01:29:08,640
so it's not exhausting you,
it's not hard,

1986
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:09,713
but you are getting some good 
circulation because you're forcing your 

1987
01:29:11,641 --> 01:29:15,330
body to pick your legs up and move 
forward and your heart starts beating.

1988
01:29:15,331 --> 01:29:16,164
And,
and I think it sort of a ignites some 

1989
01:29:18,451 --> 01:29:19,290
systems.

1990
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:21,290
Yeah.
I think that you're probably right about

1991
01:29:21,291 --> 01:29:23,600
that and you feel just the sense,
you know,

1992
01:29:23,601 --> 01:29:24,434
because you're going forward so forwards
a metaphor for success and progress and 

1993
01:29:28,641 --> 01:29:30,380
all these things.
And I think that all of that,

1994
01:29:30,381 --> 01:29:31,214
it sounds kind of silly,
but I looked at all this metaphor stuff 

1995
01:29:33,591 --> 01:29:36,010
and I don't think it's so silly,
you know,

1996
01:29:36,011 --> 01:29:36,530
uh,
you know,

1997
01:29:36,530 --> 01:29:37,840
uh,
success is up,

1998
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:41,540
moving forward as progress.
And so our bodies are connected,

1999
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:46,430
our first language as organisms,
the organisms,

2000
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:48,800
they had two things,
approach and avoid.

2001
01:29:48,801 --> 01:29:49,880
It's like,
oh look,

2002
01:29:49,881 --> 01:29:52,730
a yummy piece of plankton,
I'll approach that,

2003
01:29:52,850 --> 01:29:53,683
or oh,
that thing's gonna eat me and I'll back 

2004
01:29:56,001 --> 01:29:57,530
up.
And those,

2005
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:58,520
um,
it's called,

2006
01:29:58,520 --> 01:29:59,353
there's a term called neural reused by 
the Sky Anderson and another guy named 

2007
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:05,080
dot Haynes said it in different way,
but the,

2008
01:30:05,190 --> 01:30:09,620
the idea is that the human emotional 
system comes out of her scalp.

2009
01:30:09,620 --> 01:30:11,630
They use a term scaffolded,
I don't think they use it right,

2010
01:30:11,631 --> 01:30:16,631
but it's comes out of the approach and 
avoid mechanisms of tiny organisms.

2011
01:30:17,301 --> 01:30:20,960
So going forward,
that's approach going backward,

2012
01:30:20,961 --> 01:30:22,870
receiving that's avoid.
Um,

2013
01:30:23,170 --> 01:30:27,230
and so if you look at it that way,
it makes sense that walking,

2014
01:30:27,231 --> 01:30:28,064
that going to the bank,
I'm going to walk in a little tennis 

2015
01:30:30,021 --> 01:30:32,810
shoes in my word,
those Asian pullman sunglasses that,

2016
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:34,180
you know,
I'm going somewhere.

2017
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,950
I got them from my neighbor,
she's Japanese at a garage sale.

2018
01:30:36,970 --> 01:30:38,610
This Asian Pool,
man,

2019
01:30:39,050 --> 01:30:42,530
they're like those wraparound.
It's basically like putting a strap,

2020
01:30:42,531 --> 01:30:43,071
you know,
how they,

2021
01:30:43,071 --> 01:30:44,400
um,
like if they don't want to you,

2022
01:30:44,401 --> 01:30:45,234
I identified in a photo,
they put a black bar over your face 

2023
01:30:48,050 --> 01:30:51,770
that's like the sunglasses version,
but they're huge and they're plastic and

2024
01:30:51,771 --> 01:30:52,581
it's like,
I need a car.

2025
01:30:52,581 --> 01:30:54,170
Windshield.
I got them at her,

2026
01:30:54,230 --> 01:30:54,620
you know.

2027
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:55,550
Oh,
also because.

2028
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:57,320
So I'm,
I'm just like,

2029
01:30:57,410 --> 01:30:59,270
I'm related to white out.
And so,

2030
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:00,333
um,
I'm just hoping to not age like an old 

2031
01:31:02,780 --> 01:31:04,160
Hermes handbag,
you know,

2032
01:31:04,161 --> 01:31:04,994
by even California.
So you spray like a sunscreen all over 

2033
01:31:07,491 --> 01:31:08,800
your face when you do that too.
No,

2034
01:31:08,810 --> 01:31:12,710
I use FDA banned sunblock.
Jesus Christ.

2035
01:31:12,770 --> 01:31:13,940
Why would you do that?
No,

2036
01:31:13,970 --> 01:31:16,500
because I know the FDA,
they're wrong to bend this.

2037
01:31:16,810 --> 01:31:19,310
They don't allow the most protective 
sunblock,

2038
01:31:19,311 --> 01:31:21,890
which is with [inaudible] that they sell
in France,

2039
01:31:21,891 --> 01:31:24,650
that no French people have not been 
dropping dead in the streets.

2040
01:31:24,651 --> 01:31:25,484
They haven't been dying of cancer from 
using sunblock with his very protective 

2041
01:31:27,951 --> 01:31:28,784
ingredient.
The FDA allows the sunblock now to be 

2042
01:31:31,371 --> 01:31:32,510
sold here.
It's called anthea.

2043
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:33,433
Anthea Leo's.
But it's like with the whatever Musinex 

2044
01:31:35,931 --> 01:31:38,540
I used to take that they know have 
behind the counter and they sell the one

2045
01:31:38,541 --> 01:31:40,190
up in the aisle,
that doesn't work.

2046
01:31:40,710 --> 01:31:41,543
They removed the active ingredient and 
they sell the lesser ingredient in 

2047
01:31:44,571 --> 01:31:45,404
America.
So if you want to get the Antonios that 

2048
01:31:46,821 --> 01:31:48,290
actually works.
You have to go to France.

2049
01:31:48,291 --> 01:31:50,630
I buy a case when I'm there are other 
people bring back a dress?

2050
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:51,703
I bring back $350 worth of sunshine.
You can't even order it online and have 

2051
01:31:54,951 --> 01:31:55,160
it.
No,

2052
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:55,993
you can.
Well this is a great thing about the 

2053
01:31:56,931 --> 01:31:58,110
Internet nowadays.
You spell it.

2054
01:31:58,510 --> 01:31:59,680
Anthea,
it's a n,

2055
01:31:59,681 --> 01:32:00,460
t h

2056
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:02,780
e l I o s and there's a little French 
accent.

2057
01:32:03,380 --> 01:32:04,900
Excellent.
Accent.

2058
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:06,820
A goose.
That's the only thing I wanted to say if

2059
01:32:06,821 --> 01:32:09,240
you were French and Taleah.
Antonio's.

2060
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:10,523
Yeah.
Okay.

2061
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:14,320
So this stuff is just way stronger than 
anything you get here in America.

2062
01:32:14,350 --> 01:32:15,280
Well,
it's this oral.

2063
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:18,880
That's the ingredient that protects you 
from UVA and UVB.

2064
01:32:19,210 --> 01:32:20,530
And it's just,
it's really the,

2065
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:23,140
the most protective ingredient.
You can also get it in Canada.

2066
01:32:23,141 --> 01:32:24,510
I got someone,
I was in Vancouver,

2067
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:26,020
you know,
but um,

2068
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:30,580
I get it in France because I can get it 
cheaper there so I buy a whole case like

2069
01:32:30,581 --> 01:32:31,414
I caught you go to a bad neighborhood 
and buy it there and some like Yucky 

2070
01:32:33,581 --> 01:32:36,220
pharmacy there.
So when you're taking this stuff,

2071
01:32:36,221 --> 01:32:38,950
like what is the difference between that
and so like coppertone or something that

2072
01:32:38,951 --> 01:32:39,820
you would get in America?

2073
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:41,860
Well that doesn't.
I think it doesn't protect.

2074
01:32:41,861 --> 01:32:42,694
I can't remember whether it's Uva or uvb
that it doesn't protect against fully 

2075
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:48,400
the kind with the titanium dioxide 
protects.

2076
01:32:48,401 --> 01:32:50,770
But also the other problem with these 
sunblocks has set,

2077
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:51,963
you know,
do they affect your endocrine system in 

2078
01:32:53,421 --> 01:32:55,720
terrible ways?
I don't know,

2079
01:32:55,721 --> 01:32:57,790
but I'm so vain that I just don't want 
to be,

2080
01:32:57,870 --> 01:33:00,730
you know,
like look like a sheep dog by the factor

2081
01:33:00,731 --> 01:33:01,564
into consistent.
Well because you're putting these 

2082
01:33:02,711 --> 01:33:05,860
chemicals on your skin and stuff goes 
into your skin.

2083
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:08,200
But again,
I haven't gone outside and a long time.

2084
01:33:08,201 --> 01:33:13,201
So that sort of the effect.
So a huge hat like that,

2085
01:33:14,231 --> 01:33:15,380
you know,
it could be a witch,

2086
01:33:15,710 --> 01:33:19,150
a black hat and that helps to kind of 
crazy.

2087
01:33:19,151 --> 01:33:19,960
Amy.
I am,

2088
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:23,380
I'm nuts.
It's one of my better qualities I guess,

2089
01:33:23,381 --> 01:33:25,400
or worse.
But uh,

2090
01:33:25,450 --> 01:33:27,880
that's a,
that is an interesting point about,

2091
01:33:27,881 --> 01:33:28,714
uh,
affecting your endocrine system that I 

2092
01:33:29,561 --> 01:33:30,880
never really took into consideration.

2093
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,930
I've been thinking about sunscreen,
you know,

2094
01:33:32,931 --> 01:33:33,764
like,
because I was reading this thing about 

2095
01:33:34,550 --> 01:33:35,383
um,
the great barrier reef being destroyed 

2096
01:33:37,091 --> 01:33:41,620
by sunscreen and a spray sunscreen in 
particular over someone.

2097
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:42,513
Someone sent me this message and I don't
know if it's correct that the spray 

2098
01:33:46,421 --> 01:33:51,180
sunscreen is the issue with reese and 
not the put the rub on stuff.

2099
01:33:51,290 --> 01:33:53,170
Good.
I hate to be a feminist.

2100
01:33:53,730 --> 01:33:55,260
I don't know if that's right.
See,

2101
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:58,140
see if you could find out.
You did see something.

2102
01:33:58,220 --> 01:34:02,920
I remember looking at stuff recently and
it wasn't true,

2103
01:34:02,921 --> 01:34:06,190
but I'm looking up again for whatever 
reason,

2104
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:11,220
there's something in the Aerosol version
that is more dangerous for reefs,

2105
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:13,470
but it Kinda makes sense.
I mean,

2106
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:14,313
you're putting this fucking skanky 
chemical on you and then you're jumping 

2107
01:34:17,141 --> 01:34:17,861
in the water.
I mean,

2108
01:34:17,861 --> 01:34:18,790
where's it going?
Yeah.

2109
01:34:18,791 --> 01:34:21,370
Well it seems though that both kinds 
would work that way,

2110
01:34:21,371 --> 01:34:26,170
but maybe it's because the lotion kind 
probably absorbed more into your skin.

2111
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:27,660
Hair goes,
no,

2112
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:30,290
your sunscreen isn't good.
And the world's coral reefs.

2113
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:32,920
Varying studies.
I've found those so that I don't know if

2114
01:34:32,921 --> 01:34:33,754
this one is even accurate,
but I found two other ones that said it 

2115
01:34:35,471 --> 01:34:40,471
is burying studies produced by the sons.
I believe that is it.

2116
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:42,040
Click Bait.
I don't care.

2117
01:34:42,041 --> 01:34:46,030
Scroll up and let's see what it says.
Get a little larger there.

2118
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:47,013
Thank you sir.
Swimming that swimmers that slather 

2119
01:34:49,421 --> 01:34:51,790
themselves and sunscreen or doing their 
skin a favor,

2120
01:34:51,791 --> 01:34:52,624
but it might not be so helpful to any 
nearby coral reefs that claim released 

2121
01:34:55,631 --> 01:34:58,250
in a recent scientific study sparked 
global headlines,

2122
01:34:58,250 --> 01:34:59,083
faulting sunscreen for the global 
decline of these hot beds of 

2123
01:35:01,641 --> 01:35:02,474
biodiversity.
It's disturbing idea that something so 

2124
01:35:04,341 --> 01:35:05,174
necessary for protecting humans from 
skin cancer could be doing so much 

2125
01:35:08,151 --> 01:35:10,550
environmental damage,
but what weight should we give?

2126
01:35:10,551 --> 01:35:12,920
The scientific finding?
Not much.

2127
01:35:12,950 --> 01:35:13,783
Turns out the authors of the report who 
hail from labs and universities in the 

2128
01:35:17,361 --> 01:35:20,480
US and Israel found that.
How do you say that?

2129
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:21,970
Oxy,
Benzos,

2130
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:22,873
Benzos,
an active ingredient in some sunscreens 

2131
01:35:25,221 --> 01:35:26,054
that protects against ultraviolet light,
is present in significant quantities 

2132
01:35:29,241 --> 01:35:30,074
around recent Hawaii and the Virgin 
Islands that were favored by swimmers 

2133
01:35:32,511 --> 01:35:33,344
and divers.
They determined that the chemical has a 

2134
01:35:36,321 --> 01:35:41,321
detrimental effect on the DNA of coral 
in both its juvenile and adult stages.

2135
01:35:41,420 --> 01:35:46,100
The study was published in the Journal 
Archives and environmental contamination

2136
01:35:46,101 --> 01:35:48,260
and toxicology.
The lab,

2137
01:35:48,261 --> 01:35:49,094
the researchers exposed core in the lab.
The research is exploring exposed coral 

2138
01:35:52,551 --> 01:35:53,384
to high concentrations of oxybenzone.
Not only did it deform coral larvae by 

2139
01:35:58,281 --> 01:35:59,114
trapping them in their own skeleton.
The study found that it was also a 

2140
01:36:01,221 --> 01:36:04,100
factor in coral bleaching.
Terry Hughes,

2141
01:36:04,101 --> 01:36:06,500
director of the Australian Research 
Council,

2142
01:36:06,501 --> 01:36:11,060
Center of Excellence Crow.
He studies at James Cook University told

2143
01:36:11,061 --> 01:36:12,380
Mashable,
Australia,

2144
01:36:12,381 --> 01:36:14,990
he thought the report's findings were 
inconclusive.

2145
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:16,333
He was paid off.
His particular study was done in a 

2146
01:36:19,011 --> 01:36:19,844
laboratory,
so they actually used artificial 

2147
01:36:21,861 --> 01:36:22,694
seawater.
He explained they put tiny bits into 

2148
01:36:25,161 --> 01:36:28,760
coral in aquaria and then added some 
chemicals.

2149
01:36:28,761 --> 01:36:29,594
It's not surprising,
the coral didn't like chemicals thrown 

2150
01:36:31,161 --> 01:36:31,994
at them.
I don't know.

2151
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:33,073
See,
this is a good point and this is 

2152
01:36:33,801 --> 01:36:36,590
something when you look at studies,
this is one of the things I look at.

2153
01:36:36,591 --> 01:36:38,970
They call it in Vivo or in vitro,
you know,

2154
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:39,833
are you looking at stuff,
do they pull out some cells and do 

2155
01:36:43,611 --> 01:36:47,150
something to them and does that 
replicate or not replicate what,

2156
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:49,970
what happens in the human body?
Are there other things,

2157
01:36:49,971 --> 01:36:53,750
other reactions going on that are 
missing from them?

2158
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:55,120
You know,
when you,

2159
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:57,110
when you do that,
when you pull it out and just look at it

2160
01:36:57,111 --> 01:36:59,000
in a petri dish.
Yeah,

2161
01:36:59,001 --> 01:37:02,540
I would imagine,
but it seems like in that environment it

2162
01:37:02,541 --> 01:37:03,374
showed that the coral does not like it.
I mean I would imagine that that's not 

2163
01:37:06,860 --> 01:37:08,310
terribly surprising,
but I'd like to know

2164
01:37:08,330 --> 01:37:13,190
what are the trace amounts that they're 
seeing in coral and can they mimic those

2165
01:37:13,191 --> 01:37:16,390
and studies or are they just pouring it 
on them and you know,

2166
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,380
like salt for instance,
right?

2167
01:37:18,381 --> 01:37:19,670
If you put a little bit of salt in your 
food,

2168
01:37:19,671 --> 01:37:21,260
you're going to be fun.
You eat a pound of salt,

2169
01:37:21,261 --> 01:37:22,280
your big dead an hour.

2170
01:37:22,790 --> 01:37:23,960
Well,
this is the thing that,

2171
01:37:23,961 --> 01:37:25,010
you know,
if you look at studies,

2172
01:37:25,011 --> 01:37:25,844
this is why it's important to read them 
over and over like that and to really 

2173
01:37:28,581 --> 01:37:29,414
pick them apart if you want to assess 
them any sort of reliable way because 

2174
01:37:32,661 --> 01:37:34,670
you have to look at those nuances and 
think,

2175
01:37:34,970 --> 01:37:35,803
well wait a second,
I called this thing to leave the lab 

2176
01:37:37,371 --> 01:37:40,070
syndrome where you look at something,
they've studied something you think like

2177
01:37:40,430 --> 01:37:41,263
that's not how it works in real life.
Why are you doing the experiment that 

2178
01:37:43,851 --> 01:37:46,340
way?
That's completely dumb and so,

2179
01:37:46,341 --> 01:37:48,500
and this is stuff you don't have to be a
scientist,

2180
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:49,513
but you can.
It helps to think scientifically to 

2181
01:37:50,631 --> 01:37:54,230
think logically and so it's always good 
to enhance that thinking so you can look

2182
01:37:54,231 --> 01:37:55,560
at that,
look for the bullshit.

2183
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:57,143
Yeah.
But for a lot of people they just see 

2184
01:37:58,021 --> 01:37:59,640
that headline,
Oh,

2185
01:37:59,850 --> 01:38:03,300
coral reefs dying because of Sunscreen,
sunscreen bad.

2186
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,310
Right?
And we'd like to blame people and I felt

2187
01:38:05,370 --> 01:38:07,240
bad when you've said that.
I felt like I sucked.

2188
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:10,610
Damn it.
I'm out there killing just for my skin,

2189
01:38:10,611 --> 01:38:13,650
so will look like an old hag while also 
cancer,

2190
01:38:13,970 --> 01:38:14,880
lung cancer.
Well,

2191
01:38:14,881 --> 01:38:16,020
see,
here's the thing though.

2192
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:16,973
There's so much stuff,
so much is more complicated than we 

2193
01:38:18,361 --> 01:38:19,194
think.
Am I giving myself problems by not 

2194
01:38:21,571 --> 01:38:22,404
getting vitamin D the natural way and by
taking a pill because I take a little 

2195
01:38:25,411 --> 01:38:26,244
pill,
so that's one of those tradeoffs and I 

2196
01:38:27,481 --> 01:38:28,380
think like,
okay,

2197
01:38:28,381 --> 01:38:29,214
I eat a ketogenic diet and then I put on
the sunscreen and you look at all that 

2198
01:38:33,601 --> 01:38:35,610
and you try to make the best guests you 
can.

2199
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:38,430
That works also within what matters to 
you as a woman.

2200
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:39,563
I don't want to look really haggard,
you know when I'm 65 or you're supposed 

2201
01:38:42,610 --> 01:38:45,130
to Scotland or something.
If you look at your students,

2202
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:47,940
you're supposed to be in some marsh 
somewhere,

2203
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:50,220
right?
Exactly right.

2204
01:38:50,221 --> 01:38:51,054
Exactly.
Guy like a giant sunscreen thing and so 

2205
01:38:55,141 --> 01:38:57,780
you know when,
when you change these things in a modern

2206
01:38:57,781 --> 01:39:00,360
environment,
they call it evolutionary mismatch.

2207
01:39:00,650 --> 01:39:02,100
You know,
what are you doing?

2208
01:39:02,101 --> 01:39:07,101
Are you screwing yourself up in some way
because you aren't getting this nutrient

2209
01:39:07,591 --> 01:39:11,910
or whatever it is,
the way your body evolved to take it in?

2210
01:39:12,270 --> 01:39:14,670
Yeah.
It is such a weird thing.

2211
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:18,390
The color of people's skin is really 
just because we changed environments,

2212
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:19,770
right?
That's,

2213
01:39:20,130 --> 01:39:20,963
that's the whole.
The whole race thing is so thrown out 

2214
01:39:23,041 --> 01:39:24,810
the window when you take that into 
consideration.

2215
01:39:24,811 --> 01:39:27,300
The way we look,
the shape of our noses,

2216
01:39:27,301 --> 01:39:29,100
the shape of our faces,
the shape,

2217
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:30,173
the color of our skin,
all determined by the environment that 

2218
01:39:32,671 --> 01:39:33,360
our ancestors.

2219
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:36,000
Great.
And then all of these people who are say

2220
01:39:36,001 --> 01:39:36,834
Irish,
they all grew up in this place and so 

2221
01:39:39,001 --> 01:39:43,860
they are characteristic Irish features 
and and it's just an accepting me.

2222
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:46,620
See what what's happened now is we can't
make jokes anymore.

2223
01:39:46,770 --> 01:39:48,690
I skated with 20 black guys in New York.
Oh,

2224
01:39:48,691 --> 01:39:50,670
I stopped the thing you said about the 
football thing.

2225
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:51,691
I thought,
okay,

2226
01:39:51,691 --> 01:39:56,280
I earn a living writing and I really 
can't do a lot else that if I cracked my

2227
01:39:56,281 --> 01:39:57,114
head open,
I might not be able to earn a living 

2228
01:39:58,471 --> 01:40:00,600
ever again.
But these guys,

2229
01:40:00,601 --> 01:40:03,690
they called me white out,
which I thought was hilarious.

2230
01:40:03,970 --> 01:40:04,601
Yeah.
And,

2231
01:40:04,601 --> 01:40:07,200
and when you are not racist,
I mean it's not,

2232
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:10,320
it's not bad to joke about race,
racial stuff,

2233
01:40:10,321 --> 01:40:11,154
but now I mean it's just really the 
third rail of everything that you even 

2234
01:40:14,461 --> 01:40:15,294
say the slightest thing.
You make mention that someone's 

2235
01:40:17,140 --> 01:40:18,030
different color.

2236
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:20,760
I mean forget it,
but also there's no negative connotation

2237
01:40:20,761 --> 01:40:22,500
to being white.
Right?

2238
01:40:22,501 --> 01:40:25,080
So when you say you're wide out,
it's not bad.

2239
01:40:25,140 --> 01:40:27,330
It's not like a charcoal,
like Ooh,

2240
01:40:27,690 --> 01:40:32,690
that people use charcoal.
Charcoal doesn't seem like an insult.

2241
01:40:33,241 --> 01:40:34,890
And also black people don't seem 
chocolate.

2242
01:40:35,130 --> 01:40:37,530
I thought I had a black boyfriend.
He had chocolate.

2243
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:42,560
His skin was the color of Toklas 
Espresso or black super black.

2244
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:45,370
Well,
I think that what really dark,

2245
01:40:45,630 --> 01:40:47,910
beautiful.
Those people from from Africa.

2246
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:50,490
I do too with that gorgeous.
They're amazing.

2247
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:54,130
Until they started putting plates in 
their lips to draw the line.

2248
01:40:55,510 --> 01:40:57,120
Weightlifting.
How do you kiss someone like that?

2249
01:40:57,130 --> 01:40:59,500
You lick the plate.
Like is there food left on the plate?

2250
01:40:59,501 --> 01:41:00,800
Sorry.
Well that's what is.

2251
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,670
That is one of the weirdest spanky's.
What's they're called Ubank.

2252
01:41:04,690 --> 01:41:06,220
Jeez,
I think the people will like that.

2253
01:41:06,290 --> 01:41:06,780
Yeah.
Yeah.

2254
01:41:06,780 --> 01:41:07,613
Surrey.
That's the part of Africa that they do 

2255
01:41:09,061 --> 01:41:09,894
that I believe that seems like one of 
the weirdest sort of habits or behavior 

2256
01:41:16,381 --> 01:41:19,320
patterns that people have ever adopted 
where it's weird,

2257
01:41:19,350 --> 01:41:23,040
one of the weirdest cultural traits.
It's just passed down from generation to

2258
01:41:23,041 --> 01:41:26,190
generation and the larger the plate in 
their lip,

2259
01:41:26,191 --> 01:41:29,090
the more cattle they're worth when they 
get married.

2260
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:32,420
God super twisted.
It's like,

2261
01:41:32,430 --> 01:41:35,100
how did that ever come about?

2262
01:41:36,010 --> 01:41:38,080
No idea.
I don't know that area down there,

2263
01:41:38,081 --> 01:41:38,914
but God,
that's some of these cultural things 

2264
01:41:41,141 --> 01:41:42,460
that go on are really crazy.

2265
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:43,533
Well,
whenever you see body mutilation or 

2266
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:47,200
which is essentially what that is,
um,

2267
01:41:47,350 --> 01:41:50,590
I've,
I've read that also being connected.

2268
01:41:50,591 --> 01:41:51,610
Um,
and it's very vague now.

2269
01:41:51,611 --> 01:41:52,444
I'm trying to remember it,
but I remember it being connected 

2270
01:41:53,711 --> 01:41:54,544
somehow or another to the slave trade 
and that they've made these women less 

2271
01:41:58,451 --> 01:42:00,580
likely to be raped.
Oh,

2272
01:42:00,581 --> 01:42:01,480
interesting.
Yeah.

2273
01:42:01,540 --> 01:42:03,460
I don't know if that's true though.
Still.

2274
01:42:03,490 --> 01:42:06,880
I probably shouldn't say it,
but I do always hear things.

2275
01:42:06,881 --> 01:42:07,714
I don't know if they're true.
I just repeated and let people sort it 

2276
01:42:09,521 --> 01:42:10,271
out.
Google it,

2277
01:42:10,271 --> 01:42:11,200
folks,
don't listen to me.

2278
01:42:11,260 --> 01:42:13,960
But when you were saying about white 
people before it now actually,

2279
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:14,794
I mean,
you see this probably all over twitter 

2280
01:42:15,461 --> 01:42:18,700
to this thing of white privilege and 
there this,

2281
01:42:19,610 --> 01:42:22,690
uh,
I guess I react when I was like 18,

2282
01:42:22,700 --> 01:42:24,500
it was like typhoid,
you know?

2283
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:27,460
And um,
and so now if you're white,

2284
01:42:27,461 --> 01:42:28,840
you're just guilty.
Yeah.

2285
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:29,713
You know,
there's nothing you can do and you see 

2286
01:42:30,851 --> 01:42:31,570
this,
there's some,

2287
01:42:31,570 --> 01:42:33,100
there was a video,
it was in Berkeley,

2288
01:42:33,101 --> 01:42:35,620
some social justice guy and the woman 
just,

2289
01:42:35,621 --> 01:42:37,270
it was like,
there's basically,

2290
01:42:37,271 --> 01:42:37,931
I mean,
that's what she said.

2291
01:42:37,931 --> 01:42:40,030
There's nothing you can do.
You're guilty.

2292
01:42:40,031 --> 01:42:42,140
I wish I could remember the word chef or
white privilege.

2293
01:42:42,170 --> 01:42:42,690
Yeah,
right.

2294
01:42:42,690 --> 01:42:43,370
Oh,
odd.

2295
01:42:43,370 --> 01:42:44,300
God.
Fun.

2296
01:42:45,970 --> 01:42:46,803
I love that.

2297
01:42:48,230 --> 01:42:48,800
Yeah,
I.

2298
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:49,633
But it's what,
it's a way to silence people and it's 

2299
01:42:50,541 --> 01:42:52,340
also a way for you to be guilty of 
something.

2300
01:42:52,341 --> 01:42:53,530
Whether or not you're,
you know,

2301
01:42:53,830 --> 01:42:54,663
you getting to have a clean slate.
You are all on the defensive 

2302
01:42:56,660 --> 01:42:57,730
instantaneously.
You are,

2303
01:42:57,731 --> 01:43:02,150
you are already a guilty person.
So they can virtue signal.

2304
01:43:02,151 --> 01:43:03,840
They can decide that you know,
you,

2305
01:43:03,870 --> 01:43:06,320
you need to be punished or you need to 
be.

2306
01:43:06,530 --> 01:43:11,150
Your opinion is invalidated because of 
the Melanin content and your scan.

2307
01:43:11,151 --> 01:43:11,984
I mean

2308
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:13,570
crazy.
It's the antithesis.

2309
01:43:13,571 --> 01:43:17,350
I Love Martin Luther King and let's say 
the content of your character and that's

2310
01:43:17,351 --> 01:43:19,520
so beautiful and it just,
it's,

2311
01:43:19,530 --> 01:43:20,363
it's so terrible,
this thing of you're white and you're 

2312
01:43:22,271 --> 01:43:23,680
wrong,
and people don't understand.

2313
01:43:23,681 --> 01:43:25,720
That's the same thing as the,
the,

2314
01:43:25,890 --> 01:43:28,360
the racism that's been done to blacks,
you know,

2315
01:43:28,361 --> 01:43:29,620
for so,
so long.

2316
01:43:29,830 --> 01:43:31,600
And I mean,
I'm just,

2317
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:33,520
I'm sort of stunned by that and this 
idea.

2318
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:35,860
I mean,
basically you're racist is now shut up.

2319
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:36,893
That's what you did.
You pay attention to what went on in 

2320
01:43:39,251 --> 01:43:40,940
Evergreen State College in Washington 
state.

2321
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:42,640
I love that guy,
Brian Steen.

2322
01:43:42,641 --> 01:43:43,890
Oh my God.
He's my hero.

2323
01:43:44,830 --> 01:43:48,370
And what happened was they were.
People don't know.

2324
01:43:48,371 --> 01:43:50,560
They essentially said we're going to 
have a.

2325
01:43:50,650 --> 01:43:52,250
They used to have a day of absence

2326
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:55,550
of people of color and the idea is it's 
a very progressive school and they said,

2327
01:43:55,551 --> 01:43:56,384
look,
if we have a day where people of color 

2328
01:43:58,251 --> 01:44:00,980
or people of varying ethnic people 
aren't white,

2329
01:44:01,010 --> 01:44:04,910
essentially that's what it is.
They don't show up maybe where they will

2330
01:44:04,970 --> 01:44:05,803
be appreciated more and maybe we will 
take them into consideration more what 

2331
01:44:08,770 --> 01:44:09,603
for their absence will be felt,
so then they decided let's flip that 

2332
01:44:12,801 --> 01:44:15,950
around and force white people to stay 
home.

2333
01:44:16,190 --> 01:44:18,620
White staff members,
white teachers,

2334
01:44:18,621 --> 01:44:21,710
white students,
and Brett was like,

2335
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:24,110
you're out of your mind like this is 
racist.

2336
01:44:24,111 --> 01:44:24,944
It's one thing that you want to call 
attention to the value of people of 

2337
01:44:28,251 --> 01:44:29,084
color by not being there,
which is also arguably not the best way 

2338
01:44:32,421 --> 01:44:33,254
to handle it,
but at least you're not saying to 

2339
01:44:35,481 --> 01:44:39,500
someone that they cannot be there 
because of the color of their skin,

2340
01:44:39,740 --> 01:44:41,990
which is what you're saying.
By forcing these people to.

2341
01:44:42,740 --> 01:44:45,380
And then obviously all hell broke out.
You know?

2342
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:47,290
People were protesting him.
They were.

2343
01:44:47,291 --> 01:44:49,400
They were looking for him with baseball 
bats.

2344
01:44:49,820 --> 01:44:52,790
The whole thing is horrific,
but it's this escalation,

2345
01:44:52,910 --> 01:44:57,910
this war of ideas where you're forcing 
your ideas and your shouting people down

2346
01:44:59,570 --> 01:45:02,210
and calling people guilty before they've
ever done anything,

2347
01:45:02,390 --> 01:45:04,100
which is essentially what this is all 
about.

2348
01:45:04,101 --> 01:45:04,934
And you know,
now he's not at school anymore and then 

2349
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:09,380
school is imploding.
I mean,

2350
01:45:09,381 --> 01:45:10,220
it's really crazy

2351
01:45:10,450 --> 01:45:12,070
and actually I would argue that,
you know,

2352
01:45:12,210 --> 01:45:14,980
for,
for people who are of color too,

2353
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:20,040
to make a protest by not going to school
for a day after people fought so hard.

2354
01:45:20,291 --> 01:45:21,910
I love that.
That little girl,

2355
01:45:21,911 --> 01:45:25,270
the picture of the girls in little rock 
going to school,

2356
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:26,640
you know,
were they segregated?

2357
01:45:26,641 --> 01:45:27,474
They desegregated the school.
Imagine being a little girl and that's 

2358
01:45:30,341 --> 01:45:34,260
you going with these police officers to 
school or going crazy and,

2359
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:37,870
and to value in education and to not to 
skipping school.

2360
01:45:37,871 --> 01:45:39,250
Okay,
so then beyond that,

2361
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:40,353
Bret Weinstein said his argument was,
I think this is racist and let's not do 

2362
01:45:44,171 --> 01:45:45,460
it,
and let's talk about it.

2363
01:45:45,790 --> 01:45:50,080
And his speech in the hallway,
they're outside his classroom.

2364
01:45:50,470 --> 01:45:52,090
I saw him and I thought,
wow,

2365
01:45:52,091 --> 01:45:52,924
this is an amazing guy.
Look at how rationally is measured and 

2366
01:45:55,721 --> 01:45:59,440
calm and full of grace in,
you know,

2367
01:45:59,441 --> 01:46:01,240
there's this mob there,
you know,

2368
01:46:01,241 --> 01:46:03,760
you're calling them racist and shouting 
him down.

2369
01:46:03,770 --> 01:46:05,710
Him Down and I thought,
oh my God,

2370
01:46:05,711 --> 01:46:06,544
I want to study with the sky.
Can you please do a mooc on Coursera so 

2371
01:46:10,211 --> 01:46:11,044
I can take a class from you and learn 
how to do what you do in a heated 

2372
01:46:14,471 --> 01:46:15,304
situation.
Nick Nicholas Christakis at Yale is 

2373
01:46:16,901 --> 01:46:21,190
another one who had people screaming at 
him and was just a class act,

2374
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:24,550
you know,
and just as crazy and they've lost.

2375
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:27,820
So you'd lost Bret Weinstein from 
Evergreen.

2376
01:46:27,850 --> 01:46:28,840
He is.
I mean,

2377
01:46:28,841 --> 01:46:33,040
this guy was a valuable guy to have 
there and it's so sad that he is now.

2378
01:46:33,070 --> 01:46:35,620
It just wasn't safe for him when they're
there with baseball bats.

2379
01:46:35,950 --> 01:46:37,150
I mean,
it becomes a circus.

2380
01:46:37,151 --> 01:46:38,620
You.
It's no longer about education.

2381
01:46:38,621 --> 01:46:40,930
You can see why he couldn't go back and 
his wife too.

2382
01:46:40,931 --> 01:46:42,700
It's very sad.
Very,

2383
01:46:42,701 --> 01:46:44,920
very sad.
But this is what's happening.

2384
01:46:44,921 --> 01:46:47,020
That they're not allowing discussion.
This idea,

2385
01:46:47,021 --> 01:46:48,970
that accusation of your racist.

2386
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:52,350
This is now just this thing.
It's a just giant muscle.

2387
01:46:52,351 --> 01:46:55,170
You're supposed to shut up,
just listen to what it is,

2388
01:46:55,171 --> 01:46:56,004
is a giant muzzle just shut up and it's 
a way to silence you and it's a way to 

2389
01:46:58,801 --> 01:47:01,800
force their ideas down your throat and 
you bring something up there.

2390
01:47:01,801 --> 01:47:04,650
I call it a way to have unearned power 
over other people.

2391
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:05,993
And so I think that part of this,
the NPC part is that we have kids go to 

2392
01:47:11,551 --> 01:47:15,510
college who are not prepared for college
and this is especially true if you go to

2393
01:47:15,511 --> 01:47:16,344
some terrible school,
not if you're the child of wealthy 

2394
01:47:18,061 --> 01:47:20,820
parents who got all the sat training and
everything like that,

2395
01:47:21,150 --> 01:47:24,390
but so you get promoted because they 
want a certain color face in there.

2396
01:47:24,391 --> 01:47:27,810
So maybe you do okay at Duke,
but they send you to Harvard because you

2397
01:47:27,811 --> 01:47:28,890
can get in there because they're like,
oh,

2398
01:47:28,891 --> 01:47:30,060
we have all these Asian people.

2399
01:47:30,090 --> 01:47:32,220
Screw you Asians,
we're going to like kick you out and not

2400
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:34,360
admit you and will admit the craziest 
thing.

2401
01:47:34,590 --> 01:47:36,900
Racist.
It's so terrible.

2402
01:47:36,901 --> 01:47:40,080
So maybe that,
if you could clarify that because people

2403
01:47:40,081 --> 01:47:42,030
don't know what you're talking about.
So what they do?

2404
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:43,660
Yeah.
Policies Against Asians,

2405
01:47:43,850 --> 01:47:46,470
admission policies,
so Asians,

2406
01:47:46,471 --> 01:47:47,304
I mean,
I think it has to do something with the 

2407
01:47:48,510 --> 01:47:50,480
culture and the family there.
There's um,

2408
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:51,560
you know,
if you're Asian.

2409
01:47:51,570 --> 01:47:54,530
I had an Asian assistant before she 
lived at home with her mother,

2410
01:47:54,540 --> 01:47:56,900
father and her sisters and her grandma.
You know,

2411
01:47:57,030 --> 01:47:58,740
grandma answered the phone.
You didn't speak Korean,

2412
01:47:58,741 --> 01:47:59,574
she hung up on you.
But there was a very strong work ethic 

2413
01:48:02,491 --> 01:48:05,610
that you must succeed.
There were very strong family ethics.

2414
01:48:05,611 --> 01:48:06,444
It wasn't a single parent household.
And that's what happens to a lot of 

2415
01:48:08,850 --> 01:48:10,950
these at risk kids.
I speak at a school.

2416
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:15,170
I created a program to try to help kids 
make it by showing example,

2417
01:48:15,180 --> 01:48:15,781
like saying,
look,

2418
01:48:15,781 --> 01:48:17,040
here I am.
I failed.

2419
01:48:17,041 --> 01:48:19,530
I slept on a door in New York on two 
milk crates.

2420
01:48:19,531 --> 01:48:20,364
I'm not from a wealthy family.
You have to be creative apprentice to 

2421
01:48:22,891 --> 01:48:23,910
somebody.
All this stuff.

2422
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:25,860
Kids don't get that.
They don't get that.

2423
01:48:25,861 --> 01:48:27,660
If you're,
if you grew up in a bad neighborhood and

2424
01:48:27,661 --> 01:48:28,494
your parents don't model that sort of 
work ethic and the possibility to hope 

2425
01:48:32,251 --> 01:48:34,740
for success,
well why should you think there would be

2426
01:48:34,741 --> 01:48:36,420
any hope for you and why should you 
work?

2427
01:48:36,580 --> 01:48:37,840
Because it's a little off track.
Okay.

2428
01:48:37,850 --> 01:48:38,671
Sorry.
Getting off track.

2429
01:48:38,671 --> 01:48:42,180
The standards for standards for Asians,
so they say,

2430
01:48:42,181 --> 01:48:43,710
oh look,
all of you Asians,

2431
01:48:43,711 --> 01:48:46,200
we have too many of these Asian faces 
here.

2432
01:48:46,230 --> 01:48:47,063
It's so terrible and so we're not going 
to admit you were going to take the 

2433
01:48:49,171 --> 01:48:49,640
standards.

2434
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:50,473
Standards for Asians are going to be 
much higher than for everybody else and 

2435
01:48:53,131 --> 01:48:53,964
so if you get this grade point,
say it's like a three point eight and 

2436
01:48:56,821 --> 01:48:58,050
you're Asian,
forget it.

2437
01:48:58,051 --> 01:48:58,884
You're out.
But if you are this person of this face 

2438
01:49:00,541 --> 01:49:01,374
color that we want,
we're going to put you in there even 

2439
01:49:04,171 --> 01:49:08,400
though you know you have the same grade 
point as somebody we're kicking out.

2440
01:49:08,430 --> 01:49:09,540
Sorry to ramble.
I do that,

2441
01:49:09,780 --> 01:49:11,160
but that's what it is.
It's like the.

2442
01:49:11,190 --> 01:49:14,310
They have higher standards for 
admission,

2443
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:18,000
like they've essentially put the bar 
higher for them and it's racist.

2444
01:49:18,030 --> 01:49:18,863
It's racist,
it's terrible discrimination against a 

2445
01:49:20,971 --> 01:49:22,020
minority,
right?

2446
01:49:22,050 --> 01:49:24,000
And they are a minority and it's 
terrible.

2447
01:49:24,001 --> 01:49:24,834
And so what I hear minority than African
Americans and bigger minority than 

2448
01:49:27,901 --> 01:49:31,140
Hispanics and Latinos.
It's a big minority in America.

2449
01:49:31,141 --> 01:49:32,700
I was thinking,
I was nodding and then I thought,

2450
01:49:32,701 --> 01:49:33,000
are they?

2451
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,410
Oh,
that's really interesting.

2452
01:49:34,470 --> 01:49:36,990
Oh,
so what I suspect,

2453
01:49:36,991 --> 01:49:39,360
and I could be wrong,
this is just a guess on my part,

2454
01:49:39,390 --> 01:49:40,223
is that when you are promoted to a place
where maybe you aren't capable of 

2455
01:49:44,701 --> 01:49:45,860
succeeding,
um,

2456
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:46,973
that maybe possibly you,
instead of putting your energy into 

2457
01:49:51,430 --> 01:49:52,263
succeeding,
you put your energy into protesting and 

2458
01:49:53,951 --> 01:49:54,784
saying the system is terrible and racist
and unfair because that is the way that 

2459
01:49:58,091 --> 01:50:00,490
you become somebody and you have power 
and everything.

2460
01:50:00,491 --> 01:50:02,200
If you can't get it through the,
okay,

2461
01:50:02,201 --> 01:50:03,810
I'll work hard.
Um,

2462
01:50:03,830 --> 01:50:05,740
the way,
which isn't to say,

2463
01:50:05,741 --> 01:50:07,480
so people think that when you say that,
you're saying,

2464
01:50:07,510 --> 01:50:08,710
oh,
this group of people,

2465
01:50:08,711 --> 01:50:11,560
they're stupider or worse than other 
people.

2466
01:50:11,590 --> 01:50:14,970
But if you go back to the schools,
if you help those kids,

2467
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:16,540
this is what they're doing with charter 
schools.

2468
01:50:16,541 --> 01:50:19,360
If you give those kids what they're 
missing there,

2469
01:50:19,370 --> 01:50:19,870
there isn't.

2470
01:50:19,870 --> 01:50:20,560
You know,
we're,

2471
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:21,393
we're individuals.
You can help people who might have been 

2472
01:50:23,321 --> 01:50:25,900
throwaway people to succeed.
If they just see,

2473
01:50:25,901 --> 01:50:27,220
look,
it's possible,

2474
01:50:27,430 --> 01:50:29,320
and here,
how do we put the stability?

2475
01:50:29,321 --> 01:50:30,154
Or are you.
You're a child of a single mother that 

2476
01:50:31,421 --> 01:50:32,254
comes with it comes with certain risks.
If you grow up in a certain kind of 

2477
01:50:34,961 --> 01:50:35,794
risky neighborhood,
there's a whole area of evolutionary 

2478
01:50:38,051 --> 01:50:41,170
psychology called life history theory 
that talks about this.

2479
01:50:41,410 --> 01:50:44,290
It's called having a fast life history 
strategy.

2480
01:50:44,291 --> 01:50:46,330
It's adaptive.
If you grow up in a risky,

2481
01:50:46,331 --> 01:50:50,500
terrible neighborhood where things are 
unstable to get pregnant early,

2482
01:50:50,501 --> 01:50:52,270
if you're a male,
to be violent.

2483
01:50:52,630 --> 01:50:56,320
All these these things that aren't 
helpful in our modern society,

2484
01:50:56,500 --> 01:51:01,480
but they're kicked off by that unstable,
unstable environment where you grow up.

2485
01:51:01,481 --> 01:51:04,780
So okay,
if instability is a problem,

2486
01:51:05,110 --> 01:51:06,190
we can't just say,
okay,

2487
01:51:06,191 --> 01:51:07,024
you're single mothers should go back in 
time getting a time machine and go find 

2488
01:51:09,521 --> 01:51:11,680
a man and marry somebody before she has 
you.

2489
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:12,513
That's not realistic.
We can't throw away people and that's 

2490
01:51:15,251 --> 01:51:17,410
what I see people advocating some times.
You know,

2491
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:17,861
like,
okay,

2492
01:51:17,861 --> 01:51:20,890
well we've got to tell people to not get
pregnant without a,

2493
01:51:21,110 --> 01:51:22,630
you know,
a family structure,

2494
01:51:22,631 --> 01:51:23,464
people that they're not going to 
understand human nature and so because 

2495
01:51:25,961 --> 01:51:27,700
they've done that,
you don't punish the kids.

2496
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:32,760
How do we give those kids to stability?
They lack and I think one of the ways is

2497
01:51:32,861 --> 01:51:36,220
to have people going from the earliest 
grades and model what,

2498
01:51:36,221 --> 01:51:37,054
for example,
my parents modeled for me as these 

2499
01:51:38,551 --> 01:51:39,790
suburban,
not wealthy,

2500
01:51:39,791 --> 01:51:42,340
but just sort of middle class suburban 
people work hard,

2501
01:51:42,341 --> 01:51:43,690
do this,
do that,

2502
01:51:43,691 --> 01:51:45,310
and you will be okay.

2503
01:51:45,790 --> 01:51:46,623
Also the problem with the Asian folks in
universities is they don't complain and 

2504
01:51:51,841 --> 01:51:52,674
the squeaky wheel gets the grease and 
these people aren't protesting and 

2505
01:51:55,021 --> 01:51:55,854
aren't screaming that it's racist.
What they're doing is they're putting 

2506
01:51:57,721 --> 01:51:59,820
their head down,
they're working and they're working hard

2507
01:51:59,821 --> 01:52:01,350
and that's a part of their culture.
You know,

2508
01:52:01,351 --> 01:52:02,184
I grew up with a lot of Korean kids and 
they're extremely hard working to the 

2509
01:52:06,061 --> 01:52:06,894
point that I would feel like a lazy fuck
when I was around them and one of my 

2510
01:52:10,620 --> 01:52:12,490
good friends when I was a kid,
my friend junk,

2511
01:52:12,670 --> 01:52:13,503
he was.
He was doing his residency for medical 

2512
01:52:16,801 --> 01:52:19,920
school.
He was also competing on the US national

2513
01:52:19,921 --> 01:52:20,754
taekwondo team.
He was going to school all day long and 

2514
01:52:23,341 --> 01:52:25,350
then he was training two to three hours 
a night.

2515
01:52:25,680 --> 01:52:30,680
His kid was a fucking maniac and I would
be around him and I just felt so lazy no

2516
01:52:31,201 --> 01:52:32,960
matter how hard I worked,
it was so late,

2517
01:52:32,970 --> 01:52:35,190
but he never complained about anything 
ever.

2518
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:38,280
And it was the culture.
The culture was to never complain,

2519
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:41,850
just to work hard and never complained.
And you're seeing that in universities,

2520
01:52:41,851 --> 01:52:42,684
you're seeing that with their results,
but you're also seeing that with the 

2521
01:52:45,290 --> 01:52:47,210
that even though they're discriminated 
against,

2522
01:52:47,270 --> 01:52:50,870
like racially discriminated against by 
universities,

2523
01:52:51,140 --> 01:52:53,420
no one's complaining about it.
So they continue to do it.

2524
01:52:53,421 --> 01:52:54,254
So they do,
and they do it under the guise of 

2525
01:52:55,550 --> 01:52:56,383
diversity because so many of these Asian
people are so successful in their 

2526
01:52:59,151 --> 01:52:59,984
academic careers,
they doing so well and getting into 

2527
01:53:01,191 --> 01:53:02,024
schools,
they're pushing them out to try to 

2528
01:53:02,781 --> 01:53:03,614
balance it out,
but that doesn't balance out shit and 

2529
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:06,333
whatever you're doing is you're 
encouraging this sort of weird way of 

2530
01:53:10,191 --> 01:53:12,170
looking at people.
You know you're not,

2531
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:15,470
you're not you.
You want equality of outcome.

2532
01:53:15,710 --> 01:53:17,360
Okay?
If that's not real,

2533
01:53:17,690 --> 01:53:19,880
you know,
equality of opportunity is real.

2534
01:53:20,030 --> 01:53:23,450
Equality of outcome is not real.
It's just people.

2535
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:24,313
The equality of outcome happens when 
everyone works the same amount and this 

2536
01:53:28,701 --> 01:53:32,780
is the thing about a free society that 
people don't like to understand,

2537
01:53:33,050 --> 01:53:38,050
but when you have inequality,
inequality is by in many ways because of

2538
01:53:40,191 --> 01:53:41,024
freedom,
because you have the freedom to choose 

2539
01:53:42,711 --> 01:53:45,170
to work as much as you want or as little
as you want.

2540
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:46,153
You're going to have inequality and 
outcome and there's other factors for 

2541
01:53:49,191 --> 01:53:51,320
sure.
There is absolutely discrimination.

2542
01:53:51,470 --> 01:53:52,303
There's sexism,
there's racism is always different 

2543
01:53:53,631 --> 01:53:58,610
factors that play into account as well,
but there's also effort and to deny that

2544
01:53:58,700 --> 01:53:59,533
and tonight that effort is a factor in 
the outcome is preposterous and it sets 

2545
01:54:04,371 --> 01:54:07,400
up this fantasy land that so many kids 
live in today.

2546
01:54:07,490 --> 01:54:10,970
While they're protesting.
Ben Shapiro calling him a fucking Nazi.

2547
01:54:11,120 --> 01:54:13,640
That's where it all comes from.
That there's these,

2548
01:54:13,780 --> 01:54:14,550
you know,
these.

2549
01:54:14,550 --> 01:54:17,150
You have a campus,
these,

2550
01:54:17,151 --> 01:54:21,560
these kids that are trying to shut down 
Republican speaking on campus by calling

2551
01:54:21,561 --> 01:54:25,040
them and these blanket statements.
They're white supremacists and racists.

2552
01:54:25,041 --> 01:54:25,874
Like,
okay,

2553
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:28,280
well what about Ben Carson?
He's a fucking Republican too,

2554
01:54:28,281 --> 01:54:29,114
and he's black.
There's a lot of people that are black 

2555
01:54:30,801 --> 01:54:31,634
that are republican is a preposterous 
way of looking at the world and it's 

2556
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:37,670
this sort of isolationist view and it's.
It's weird.

2557
01:54:37,790 --> 01:54:41,420
It's weird that they don't see how 
racist it is to discriminate against

2558
01:54:41,460 --> 01:54:42,293
Asian people.
It's terribly racist and also if you 

2559
01:54:44,521 --> 01:54:46,620
look at what real diversity is,
to me,

2560
01:54:46,830 --> 01:54:51,240
it's bringing in people who didn't have 
economic advantage because these,

2561
01:54:51,241 --> 01:54:52,074
the people who have a hard time,
it doesn't matter if they're black or 

2562
01:54:53,911 --> 01:54:54,860
white,
you know,

2563
01:54:54,870 --> 01:54:57,960
I know I have a number of black friends 
who are highly successful.

2564
01:54:58,110 --> 01:55:01,470
Some of them are researchers and they 
grew up in suburban neighborhoods.

2565
01:55:01,471 --> 01:55:03,660
They grew up like I did.
They had a family.

2566
01:55:03,690 --> 01:55:05,810
Their family was intact,
you know,

2567
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:09,060
they didn't need a leg up from anybody 
because they did what I did,

2568
01:55:09,061 --> 01:55:10,650
which is work hard.
My mother told me,

2569
01:55:10,651 --> 01:55:11,484
so I grew up a Jewish kid in an 
neighborhood with no Jews and they like 

2570
01:55:13,501 --> 01:55:14,880
Egged her house and everything like 
that.

2571
01:55:15,090 --> 01:55:16,980
My mother said to me,
you know,

2572
01:55:17,070 --> 01:55:17,903
there are people who hate Jews,
so you're going to have to work harder 

2573
01:55:20,101 --> 01:55:20,934
than other people because some people 
are going to be prejudiced against you 

2574
01:55:22,861 --> 01:55:25,380
and try to keep you out.
So that was a message,

2575
01:55:25,381 --> 01:55:25,921
not,
oh,

2576
01:55:25,921 --> 01:55:28,280
we should whine about this and isn't 
this terrible?

2577
01:55:28,450 --> 01:55:30,480
His murderer issues my parents can be.

2578
01:55:30,860 --> 01:55:31,520
Yeah.
It's.

2579
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:32,353
I don't know.
It's.

2580
01:55:32,930 --> 01:55:33,763
It would be really beautiful if 
everybody just did the Martin Luther 

2581
01:55:36,290 --> 01:55:36,771
King thing,
right?

2582
01:55:36,771 --> 01:55:39,020
Just judge people in the content of 
their character,

2583
01:55:39,070 --> 01:55:39,903
not the color of their skin,
not the origin of their birth or their 

2584
01:55:42,690 --> 01:55:43,830
ancestors birth,

2585
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:45,113
but unfortunately we are tribal and we 
do have these weird tendencies to sort 

2586
01:55:49,051 --> 01:55:51,000
of lump ourselves together.
And by the way,

2587
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:53,040
for people that are listening to this,
to disagreeing,

2588
01:55:53,070 --> 01:55:54,940
if you're a fucking social justice 
warrior,

2589
01:55:54,941 --> 01:55:56,560
your tribal too.
If you're,

2590
01:55:56,630 --> 01:55:59,070
you're a radical lefty,
you're fucking tribal.

2591
01:55:59,071 --> 01:56:00,750
That's,
that's a tribal outlook,

2592
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:01,853
you know,
and we would all be better off if we 

2593
01:56:03,321 --> 01:56:04,800
were a little,
a little bit more balanced.

2594
01:56:04,801 --> 01:56:05,634
Me included.

2595
01:56:05,780 --> 01:56:07,790
Well me included to.
I mean,

2596
01:56:07,791 --> 01:56:11,720
and if we listen,
what I try to do is to look at the other

2597
01:56:11,721 --> 01:56:12,740
side,
you know,

2598
01:56:12,741 --> 01:56:16,370
the style side I don't agree with like 
you were talking about this before where

2599
01:56:16,371 --> 01:56:20,420
you maybe see things,
you see their point or you look at stuff

2600
01:56:20,421 --> 01:56:23,120
that you want to agree with.
There was a nick kristoff thing.

2601
01:56:23,180 --> 01:56:25,280
I'm a piece on,
okay,

2602
01:56:25,281 --> 01:56:28,970
here's what we have to do with guns.
And I looked at it because we all want,

2603
01:56:28,971 --> 01:56:32,450
there's this idea of like do something,
we want to do something but something is

2604
01:56:32,451 --> 01:56:33,284
not a good thing to do.
And I looked at his piece wanting to 

2605
01:56:35,391 --> 01:56:37,760
find something in there that would say 
yes,

2606
01:56:37,761 --> 01:56:39,770
we just do these things in every single 
thing in there.

2607
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:44,030
It was all meaningless stuff that 
wouldn't have stopped the guy in Vegas.

2608
01:56:44,420 --> 01:56:47,300
And so I looked at that wanting to see 
something and you see nothing.

2609
01:56:47,301 --> 01:56:48,134
And so it's the thing of being honest,
being intellectually honest and honest 

2610
01:56:51,111 --> 01:56:53,030
when your site is full of shit too.

2611
01:56:53,260 --> 01:56:54,790
Yeah.
And you know,

2612
01:56:54,791 --> 01:56:56,920
when it comes to something like the 
thing in Vegas,

2613
01:56:56,921 --> 01:57:00,490
we want to find some sort of solution 
when it doesn't necessarily exist.

2614
01:57:00,491 --> 01:57:01,324
There's so many different factors.
I mean obviously the access to weapons 

2615
01:57:03,581 --> 01:57:05,530
is a big one.
That's a huge one.

2616
01:57:05,531 --> 01:57:07,990
And to deny that it's silly to deny that
on the right,

2617
01:57:08,020 --> 01:57:08,853
like the people that are massive second 
amendment proponents like to deny that 

2618
01:57:12,271 --> 01:57:13,104
the access to weapons has no factor in 
someone using those weapons is pretty 

2619
01:57:16,541 --> 01:57:17,740
fucking stupid.
I mean,

2620
01:57:17,741 --> 01:57:18,574
it doesn't make any sense,
but then to say that those weapons 

2621
01:57:21,790 --> 01:57:26,080
should not be accessible to people who 
are not criminals.

2622
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:28,690
That's also weird because you're saying 
like,

2623
01:57:28,691 --> 01:57:30,460
well,
what if you have.

2624
01:57:30,820 --> 01:57:31,653
If we have laws in this country that 
allow a person to go and buy a gun for 

2625
01:57:34,841 --> 01:57:35,674
personal safety and then something like 
this happens where people get shot and 

2626
01:57:39,731 --> 01:57:40,564
murdered by some crazy person and then 
you take those rights away from the 

2627
01:57:44,621 --> 01:57:47,650
people who have done nothing wrong.
That's not good either.

2628
01:57:47,890 --> 01:57:48,320
I mean,

2629
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:50,080
yeah,
it doesn't stop it either.

2630
01:57:50,130 --> 01:57:52,100
Look at the Charlie Hebdo thing in 
France.

2631
01:57:52,510 --> 01:57:53,343
They don't allow guns in France.
I don't even know if the policemen 

2632
01:57:55,371 --> 01:57:56,790
armed.
I don't think they are different

2633
01:57:56,940 --> 01:57:57,361
thing.
Right?

2634
01:57:57,361 --> 01:57:59,920
Because that's Muslim extremists that 
we're acting on religious

2635
01:58:00,020 --> 01:58:01,990
pulses,
but they got guns.

2636
01:58:01,991 --> 01:58:05,530
They got horrible,
horrible guns that killed people.

2637
01:58:05,531 --> 01:58:06,364
I mean it at that.
I think they might've even been 

2638
01:58:08,801 --> 01:58:09,634
automatic weapons.
I mean I don't want to use that term 

2639
01:58:11,171 --> 01:58:12,580
because I don't know anything about 
guns,

2640
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:17,070
so I probably just use that wrong,
but they don't allow guns in Francis.

2641
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:18,760
They got them and I think that 
criminals,

2642
01:58:18,761 --> 01:58:19,840
I live near the hood,
you know,

2643
01:58:19,841 --> 01:58:21,440
you can get whatever drug you want,
you know,

2644
01:58:21,441 --> 01:58:24,760
and the coroner.
Can you get that through my adderall?

2645
01:58:24,830 --> 01:58:25,780
Um,
you know,

2646
01:58:25,870 --> 01:58:27,330
maybe.
I don't know.

2647
01:58:27,990 --> 01:58:28,823
Good question.

2648
01:58:29,630 --> 01:58:31,420
Access is it's way.
Look,

2649
01:58:31,430 --> 01:58:33,890
Australia is a perfect example.
They had one mass shooting.

2650
01:58:33,891 --> 01:58:36,140
They rounded up all the guns.
They haven't had a single one sense,

2651
01:58:36,760 --> 01:58:37,593
you know,
but Australia also has less people than 

2652
01:58:38,871 --> 01:58:41,740
Los Angeles and it's huge.
It's the size United States.

2653
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:43,420
So you know,
there's,

2654
01:58:43,450 --> 01:58:44,283
there's a,
there's a discussion to be had for sure 

2655
01:58:46,360 --> 01:58:47,193
and along you know,
the way we need to discuss access to 

2656
01:58:50,861 --> 01:58:53,110
firearms.
That's a part of that discussion.

2657
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:54,273
But you know,
I talked about it the other day with my 

2658
01:58:55,391 --> 01:58:56,224
friend Alonzo Bowden and immediately 
people were put making articles saying 

2659
01:59:00,041 --> 01:59:03,190
that we are calling for a police state 
and confiscation of the guns.

2660
01:59:03,430 --> 01:59:04,900
I didn't say that.
No one said that,

2661
01:59:04,930 --> 01:59:07,510
but this is the right wing,
you know,

2662
01:59:07,511 --> 01:59:12,430
second amendment proponent,
knee jerk reaction to an instantaneously

2663
01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:17,460
demonize anyone is critical of the guy 
having the access to 23 fucking rifles.

2664
01:59:17,510 --> 01:59:18,343
Right?
And see the thing that that's happened 

2665
01:59:19,101 --> 01:59:21,710
with the polarization is that now just 
saying,

2666
01:59:21,950 --> 01:59:23,840
let's think about this,
you know,

2667
01:59:23,841 --> 01:59:26,630
because I'm libertarian,
I'm pro second amendment,

2668
01:59:26,631 --> 01:59:29,060
but I also think,
let's look at this.

2669
01:59:29,061 --> 01:59:31,130
That's not bad to say,
let's look at this.

2670
01:59:31,131 --> 01:59:33,620
This doesn't mean we're going,
we want to take away everybody's guns.

2671
01:59:33,621 --> 01:59:37,910
It means that we want to think about 
things as it's ever been a clear.

2672
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:42,100
There's a giant problem with someone 
having access to guns like that.

2673
01:59:42,610 --> 01:59:43,443
Show it to me because this guy broke 
windows in a hotel and shot 500 fucking 

2674
01:59:48,131 --> 01:59:48,964
people.
God,

2675
01:59:49,770 --> 01:59:54,040
if that's not a clear situation where 
people need to look at it and go,

2676
01:59:54,041 --> 01:59:55,570
okay,
how does this get presented?

2677
01:59:55,990 --> 01:59:58,330
And it doesn't get presented by burring 
your head in the sand.

2678
01:59:58,331 --> 01:59:59,164
It doesn't get offended.
It doesn't get prevented by just going 

2679
02:00:01,601 --> 02:00:04,110
back to the second amendment and it just
yelling it out,

2680
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:06,790
stomping your feet and pound your fist 
on the table,

2681
02:00:06,900 --> 02:00:09,000
you know,
shall not be infringed.

2682
02:00:09,090 --> 02:00:09,923
That is not how you prevent your 
children from getting shot by a fucking 

2683
02:00:12,841 --> 02:00:13,710
psycho.
See,

2684
02:00:13,711 --> 02:00:16,500
I think what's hard in this too is that 
we don't have any answers.

2685
02:00:16,501 --> 02:00:17,550
There's no.
Well,

2686
02:00:17,551 --> 02:00:18,384
if it was just mental health or just 
this or just that because it's a 

2687
02:00:20,581 --> 02:00:21,414
mystery.
So people are just grasping at things 

2688
02:00:24,031 --> 02:00:26,790
and everybody standing their ground,
they eat the pro gun,

2689
02:00:26,791 --> 02:00:27,624
the anti gun,
and they're saying cc and all the 

2690
02:00:30,181 --> 02:00:33,090
disgusting stuff on twitter.
And people did try to curb this a bit.

2691
02:00:33,091 --> 02:00:33,924
This stuff of people using that as a 
ramp for their own whatever their views 

2692
02:00:38,251 --> 02:00:40,380
were.
And that was pretty ugly.

2693
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:41,940
You know,
seeing those videos,

2694
02:00:41,941 --> 02:00:43,890
you always have that right?
Will you always have that.

2695
02:00:43,891 --> 02:00:44,671
But in this,
you know,

2696
02:00:44,671 --> 02:00:46,500
when it's loss of life and it's not 
just,

2697
02:00:46,501 --> 02:00:48,060
oh,
trump said this dumb thing,

2698
02:00:48,380 --> 02:00:50,850
you know,
that's that just barrage.

2699
02:00:50,851 --> 02:00:52,770
I saw that video of all the people 
running,

2700
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:54,170
um,
you know,

2701
02:00:54,380 --> 02:00:55,380
that it was,
um,

2702
02:00:55,410 --> 02:00:56,243
there's a,
it's like a 10 minute video and the 

2703
02:00:58,051 --> 02:00:58,884
police hurting them.
Some people didn't even realize it was 

2704
02:01:00,301 --> 02:01:02,130
gun fire and you hear that,
that,

2705
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:05,610
that constant barrage when you hear that
for that period of time,

2706
02:01:05,910 --> 02:01:09,030
that gun going off so many times and so 
many people,

2707
02:01:09,450 --> 02:01:11,820
um,
being just that guy's victim,

2708
02:01:11,850 --> 02:01:15,300
that was so horrible.
That guy's brother getting interviewed.

2709
02:01:15,660 --> 02:01:18,150
No,
I just saw a photograph of the 90 minute

2710
02:01:18,151 --> 02:01:18,640
interview

2711
02:01:18,640 --> 02:01:22,690
is one of the most fucking bizarre 
interviews I've ever seen in my life.

2712
02:01:22,691 --> 02:01:27,691
He's so removed from his brother doing 
this and he's talking about what a great

2713
02:01:27,851 --> 02:01:31,150
guy his brother is and how quirky his 
brother was,

2714
02:01:31,830 --> 02:01:34,210
how his,
his brother was just.

2715
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:35,073
He was eccentric and he was just talking
about what his brother would have done 

2716
02:01:38,681 --> 02:01:40,220
in the casino.
People all

2717
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:42,920
knew his brother and to say they didn't 
know him was crazy,

2718
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:47,720
but this guy seems like a guy trying to 
act normal.

2719
02:01:47,830 --> 02:01:49,220
It is so weird.
I mean,

2720
02:01:49,250 --> 02:01:50,083
there might be some sort of a mental 
health issue with the entire family 

2721
02:01:51,891 --> 02:01:55,670
because the dad apparently was a psycho 
and was a serial bank robber.

2722
02:01:56,510 --> 02:01:57,343
I don't know,
but it's some of the fucking strangers 

2723
02:01:59,901 --> 02:02:04,100
interview where he's not like horrified.
He's not crying.

2724
02:02:04,250 --> 02:02:05,650
He's not stunned.
It's,

2725
02:02:05,651 --> 02:02:06,484
it's so fucking weird.
And it brings me back to the whole 

2726
02:02:09,200 --> 02:02:11,690
mental health aspect of it.
You have,

2727
02:02:11,750 --> 02:02:12,583
there has to be a lot of shit wrong with
your mind for you to be able to do 

2728
02:02:15,861 --> 02:02:17,240
something like that.
What it is,

2729
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:19,910
what it is.
I hope we figure it out,

2730
02:02:19,940 --> 02:02:22,400
but sure do.
To Jesus.

2731
02:02:22,401 --> 02:02:23,234
Amy.
I thought it was gonna be a positive 

2732
02:02:23,781 --> 02:02:26,600
interview to be a big old bomber.
A crazy girl.

2733
02:02:26,630 --> 02:02:27,850
What can I say?
Fine.

2734
02:02:27,890 --> 02:02:29,300
This is great.
It was fun.

2735
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:30,540
I really enjoyed it.
Me Too.

2736
02:02:30,590 --> 02:02:31,423
Um,
so for people to want to read your 

2737
02:02:33,291 --> 02:02:35,600
column,
it's advice goddess.com.

2738
02:02:35,810 --> 02:02:37,490
Yeah.
Or actually I prefer they read it,

2739
02:02:37,491 --> 02:02:40,340
look it up and papers and some of them 
have changed it to the name I prefer,

2740
02:02:40,341 --> 02:02:42,180
which is science advice.
Got Us stuck concert.

2741
02:02:42,190 --> 02:02:45,130
I feel like this chick who is just 
pulling out of her butt,

2742
02:02:45,170 --> 02:02:50,170
and then I have a new book,
unfuck ology field guide bucket in a lot

2743
02:02:50,511 --> 02:02:51,410
of your books.
I know.

2744
02:02:51,411 --> 02:02:52,244
So terrible.
This was an accident and it actually 

2745
02:02:55,130 --> 02:02:55,963
sets a unfuck log,
a field guide to living with guts and 

2746
02:02:57,741 --> 02:03:00,230
confidence and good manners for Nice 
people sometimes say,

2747
02:03:00,231 --> 02:03:01,250
fuck.
Thank you,

2748
02:03:01,251 --> 02:03:02,084
amy.
It was a lot of fun talking to you is 

2749
02:03:02,991 --> 02:03:03,801
great.
All right folks,

2750
02:03:03,801 --> 02:03:05,720
we'll be back in a little bit with a 
Russell brand.

2751
02:03:05,750 --> 02:03:06,140
See you.

2752
02:03:06,140 --> 02:03:08,970
Yeah.
