1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,270
Okay,

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,090
he's alive.
All right.

3
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:15,630
We're live,
Carlos condit and Irwin the core.

4
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:17,550
Welcome gentlemen.
Welcome.

5
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:18,870
Thanks for doing this.
Appreciate you.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,980
Of course.
Thanks for having us.

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,990
I'm so happy.
First of all,

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,330
for folks who are not aware of the 
situation,

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,250
what's going on?
Uh,

10
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,990
Carlos Professional MMA fighter,
one of the best in the world,

11
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:32,991
just fought for the welterweight title.
Extremely close fight against Robbie 

12
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,811
lawler.
And you spent a lot of your time this 

13
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:36,270
camp.
How many camps was it?

14
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:38,520
Were you trained with Irwin to now to 
now?

15
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,870
Yep.
And Irwin,

16
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:44,670
you are a movement specialist and this 
is all the rage in mma right now.

17
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,690
It's gets really kind of fascinating as 
this sport grows and develops.

18
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,110
We're looking at a sport that's really 
only realistically been around since 

19
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:59,031
1993.
That's when it sort of form martial 

20
00:00:59,031 --> 00:00:59,031
arts,
of course had been around forever,

21
00:00:59,031 --> 00:01:03,050
but as a sport where people really 
started picking it apart and trying to 

22
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:03,300
figure out what's the best way to pursue
this.

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,480
It's really only been since about 1993 
when the UFC first started and the most 

24
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:13,791
recent trend is guys trying to improve 
upon balance movement and their ability 

25
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:21,381
to close distances and attack and be in 
a position to constantly be able to do 

26
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:28,911
that in between those techniques.
So instead of concentrating on just 

27
00:01:28,911 --> 00:01:32,940
hitting pads or just doing shooting 
doubles or doing various drills,

28
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,090
you're concentrating on the movements 
that take place in between those 

29
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:38,910
techniques.
Is that a fair way to describe it?

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,450
Um,
yeah.

31
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,270
And,
and I think that the movement,

32
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,580
uh,
also helps,

33
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:46,810
uh,
in,

34
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,420
in the techniques themselves,
you know,

35
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:50,050
we,
we can focus specifically

36
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,130
play on,
on,

37
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:56,150
you know,
martial arts technique techniques which 

38
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:56,150
are know on a base level movement.
Right,

39
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,460
right.
And how did you guys get hooked up?

40
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,780
Uh,
I reached out to,

41
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,850
to Carlos.
Yeah.

42
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,290
Actually,
it's one of your requirements that you 

43
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:06,290
were commenting on one of those UFC 
events and uh,

44
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:11,290
you,
you talked about the current state of 

45
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:11,290
the welterweight division and at some 
point you talked about Carlos and he was

46
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,870
still recovering from his injury and,
and you said that at this point,

47
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:15,680
uh,
you know,

48
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:18,720
he was 31 or four years old back then 
and uh,

49
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:24,430
it was a serious injury and that from 
then on it could only somewhat gets 

50
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,710
slower and that made me react because it
was both true and not true.

51
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,900
True.
From a conventional standpoint,

52
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,200
it's true.
But from a,

53
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,860
a,
a training,

54
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,620
coaching,
a movement practice standpoint,

55
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,560
I knew that there was a possibility to,
to,

56
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,000
uh,
to reverse that,

57
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,100
to improve,
right?

58
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:47,140
And that this is actually a vacuum and 
that made me think Carlos is right 

59
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,140
there.

60
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,520
I need to reach out to him.
I can train him and I can show that 

61
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,000
there are some different methods that 
can bring results.

62
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,880
Even in a seasoned fighters,
uh,

63
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,930
like Carlos,
what is your background turning in the 

64
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,821
woods a lot.
The window was a kid moving in the 

65
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:05,821
woods,
climbing trees,

66
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:07,760
jumping from rock to rock and being 
lonely,

67
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,110
being encouraged to do that by my own 
dad.

68
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,940
Um,
uh,

69
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,990
in the.
And then later on I did some extreme 

70
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:23,161
trainings I would say in Paris with a 
very small group and we would climb 

71
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:27,620
scaffoldings and uh,
we will jump off bridges and we would 

72
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,550
balance on top of the class scaffoldings
like popcorn type stuff.

73
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,880
It was,
it was a part of the movement because,

74
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,800
uh,
the founder of par core,

75
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:40,120
David Bill was almost my neighbor and 
practically we're the same age,

76
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:45,121
but we didn't know each other back then 
and I was filling in all the guy and we 

77
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:45,550
would do these,
uh,

78
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,980
these trainings because we were 
somewhat,

79
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:52,080
um,
wanted to go against the normalcy that,

80
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,260
you know,
how heavy the nurse you have normalcy of

81
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,060
wanting to do a to know ourselves,
uh,

82
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:06,090
through,
through movements and exercises and 

83
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,870
challenges that were complete out of,
out of this world.

84
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,420
What do you mean by heavy?
The inertia of normalcy?

85
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,950
What exactly do you mean by that?
Well,

86
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,200
I'd like to save at normal of silent 
killer.

87
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,380
A lot of people are just extremely bored
by their day to day routines and kills 

88
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,821
them.
It shrinks their comfort zone all the 

89
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:23,821
time.
And um,

90
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:24,180
uh,
it rubs their,

91
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,390
their,
their creativity,

92
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,240
their,
their vitality,

93
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:33,330
um,
because we're not meant to live such 

94
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,360
predictable lives and,
um,

95
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,810
we're actually,
we're supposed to be extremely 

96
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,860
adaptable.
That mental and physical level and we,

97
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,900
we need to train that adaptability by a,
presenting ourselves with the challenges

98
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,430
that are going to maintain that 
adaptability.

99
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,430
It's,
it's we need a strategy.

100
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,980
Um,
if a lifestyle is boring,

101
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,100
if we're born in our lives board,
in our lifestyle,

102
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:05,490
uh,
there's nothing in this world that's 

103
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,910
going to really a change that we can 
entertain ourselves.

104
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,940
We can consume tons of entertainment,
but what we need truly to get out of 

105
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,441
this is a strategy,
a to a perception of oneself that is 

106
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:16,570
different.

107
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,190
And then the strategy that's in line 
with that perception of a strongest self

108
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,500
have a more free self.
I don't know,

109
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:26,950
it's a very philosophical,
but you asked me about it.

110
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,270
Um,
I'm just telling you,

111
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:28,720
the,
the,

112
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,580
the West,
think about it,

113
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,820
if I had followed a,
you know,

114
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,210
what the box,
the textbooks,

115
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,290
the,
uh,

116
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,800
the conventions,
I would not be in the place I am today,

117
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,860
I would not have done what I've created.
So it's a philosophy as much as it's a 

118
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:47,950
training modality because everything in 
life is philosophy,

119
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:50,530
but you call it philosophy,
outlook,

120
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,260
perspective,
opinion,

121
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:55,030
values,
whatever you call it,

122
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,830
it's something in your mind is a certain
perception

123
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,100
that makes you see yourself,
see the world a certain way and behave 

124
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,730
accordingly.
A bodybuilder,

125
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,100
you may,
you may think that it's purely physical,

126
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:08,570
but it's not,
it's a philosophy.

127
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:13,610
The guy who wants to be big as a 
perception of himself as being very big 

128
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,950
and he's getting to train accordingly.
So it always starts with the perception 

129
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,960
and then you behave accordingly.
So everything in that sense,

130
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:26,110
his philosophy now when you met this 
character will apply to all these 

131
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:33,371
movement teachers look like Jesus 
because that's a question that's been 

132
00:06:33,371 --> 00:06:35,780
coming up over and over again on the 
forums when I feel obligated to ask.

133
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,920
Um,
I think there are a lot of the,

134
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,120
the,
the naturalistic persuasion.

135
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,260
So,
uh,

136
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,270
first first impression of Irwin was that
he's very intense.

137
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:55,630
Uh,
we went and we know there's a wooded 

138
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,230
area there in albuquerque and we thought
we're going to go play around,

139
00:06:57,231 --> 00:06:58,460
you know,
walk on some,

140
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,560
you know,
walk on some blogs and just kick in 

141
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:03,560
immediately.

142
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:03,560
It's like,
no,

143
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,020
we're working.
And it was from the first time that we 

144
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:12,410
started,
he was demanding excellence and,

145
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,460
you know,
demanding,

146
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,270
uh,
quite a bit of,

147
00:07:15,271 --> 00:07:15,880
of,
of,

148
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,730
of focus.
And for me,

149
00:07:17,731 --> 00:07:22,731
you know,
I'm kind of like an add type of person 

150
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:22,731
and um,
you know,

151
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:23,660
I,
that's why I fight.

152
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:25,700
There's a lot of different things to do.
I can move,

153
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:28,250
I can play,
I can focus at certain times,

154
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:29,800
then go fuck around at other times.
And,

155
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:35,140
and I'm working with Erwin.
It's not only been a beneficial for,

156
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,160
for me physically,
but also,

157
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,210
um,
you know,

158
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,800
as far as my,
my,

159
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,580
my,
uh,

160
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,170
focus and uh,
just my,

161
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,430
my attention.
I'm physically.

162
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,720
Initially it was hard,
man.

163
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,720
I was,
I was maybe seven or eight months off my

164
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:51,960
knee surgery.
Um,

165
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,550
my body was stiff.
I had a great physical therapist and we 

166
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,370
were making progress in,
in that respect.

167
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,320
But,
um,

168
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,850
I wasn't there yet.
I had a lot of imbalances.

169
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,300
I was,
it was still kind of fucked up.

170
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:05,770
But,
um,

171
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,840
what type of knee surgery you had?
ACL reconstruction.

172
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:13,580
Did you get cadaver or Patella?
I had an allograft or cadaver.

173
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,710
I like that.
That's my favorite one.

174
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:20,711
I encourage people to do that.
I know the guys have said that it 

175
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:20,870
doesn't take,
but when guys say it doesn't take,

176
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:24,140
I always wonder if they were training 
too hard,

177
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,430
too quick.
So,

178
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:26,900
um,
I have a good friend who's a,

179
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:27,400
a,
a,

180
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,570
a orthopedic surgeon,
and he,

181
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,840
he told me that it's strong initially 
because they use somebody,

182
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,920
a Achilles tendon,
which is four times thicker than your 

183
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,500
actual 50 percent stronger than a 
regular acl.

184
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,890
But as your body's assimilating it,
uh,

185
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,950
it gets weaker.
It apparently your body does this 

186
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,540
scaffolding of its own cells around it 
as it's assimilating it to your own 

187
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,620
tissue and it,
it gets weaker during that point.

188
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,620
Eventually you wait a year,
18 months,

189
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,090
it's going to be stronger than it was 
before.

190
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:01,620
But even that period,
seven,

191
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:03,750
eight months where you're feeling good,
um,

192
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,220
the inflammation's gone away,
the swelling has gone down.

193
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:08,640
You're like,
oh,

194
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:09,870
I feel,
I feel amazing.

195
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:12,120
I can go fucking train,
I can go spar.

196
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,410
Boom.
You blow it.

197
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah.
And they say it didn't take.

198
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,560
But that's not really true,
right?

199
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,420
I don't,
I don't think it's true.

200
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,060
That wasn't my experience.
I've thankfully,

201
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,040
from what I've talked to doctors,
they,

202
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:28,041
that's exactly how they said it too,
that you feel really good and you start 

203
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:28,770
training hard.
Then you blow it out at Herman did that,

204
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:32,610
Dominick Cruz did that.
A bunch of guys have done that and it's,

205
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:34,650
um,
it's very common.

206
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,210
Yeah.
So,

207
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,530
uh,
you know,

208
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,650
Erwin and I started working together 
initially.

209
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,270
It's,
man,

210
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:46,290
I couldn't do hardly any of this stuff 
and I'm a high level athlete and it was 

211
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:46,290
frustrating.

212
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:46,290
So,
um,

213
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,440
I would go and I didn't put a little bit
of information from him,

214
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:53,130
I'd work a little bit by myself and then
the next time we worked at I had,

215
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:58,260
I would have made some progress and um,
we'd worked together for,

216
00:09:58,261 --> 00:09:59,490
you know,
once a week,

217
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:03,000
maybe twice a week for over a year now.
And now how,

218
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,340
how are your camp structured?
Because a lot of people,

219
00:10:05,341 --> 00:10:07,530
they structure the camps are very 
regimented.

220
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:12,531
They have the particular days for 
strength and conditioning and it's all 

221
00:10:12,531 --> 00:10:15,720
sort of design so that they have enough 
time to recover for their skill work and

222
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:20,721
especially if you're working in that 
specific techniques for a specific type 

223
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:23,961
of fighter and you would have to 
incorporate all these things and then 

224
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,790
this movement training and stuff as 
well.

225
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,620
Like how would you figure out when to 
put that in?

226
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:33,621
Did you have to experiment or every camp
really isn't experiment because as I've 

227
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:38,400
grown as an athlete,
I've changed as I've got older,

228
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:43,460
you know,
I have to take more time off than I did 

229
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:43,460
before.

230
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:43,460
I have to really,
you know,

231
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,790
pay,
pay attention to my body.

232
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,370
So we do have somewhat of a structure 
like that,

233
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,280
but it's also every,
every,

234
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,260
all the scheduling is tentative.
It's like,

235
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:53,670
okay,
yeah,

236
00:10:53,671 --> 00:10:56,700
I have this scheduled on this day,
but if I'm feeling like shit,

237
00:10:56,701 --> 00:10:57,920
I'm not going to go in there and do 
that.

238
00:10:57,921 --> 00:10:59,150
That's,
that's a good way to get hurt.

239
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,930
It's a big fight.
I can't,

240
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,660
I can't get fucked up.
So when you feel like real worn out,

241
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,930
you have to sort of like really be 
paying attention to your body?

242
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,100
Yeah,
absolutely.

243
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,620
Um,
and we do active recovery.

244
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,680
My strength conditioning,
the place that I,

245
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,190
that I go,
um,

246
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:20,630
we do a lot of different things.
They use some biofeedback,

247
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,420
a dove,
a software that is pretty cool.

248
00:11:24,421 --> 00:11:29,421
You stick some fucking sticky pads on 
your body and like ekg thing and it can 

249
00:11:29,421 --> 00:11:33,300
actually tell you physiologically what 
your readiness level is.

250
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,350
And this is being used by a ton of 
different.

251
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:40,650
I'm a professional athlete or 
professional teams.

252
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,760
I'm a collegiate teams and professional 
teams and Olympians.

253
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,980
So the checking,
like muscle balance,

254
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,560
a lactic acid?
No,

255
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:50,430
this,
I would,

256
00:11:50,431 --> 00:11:51,210
it would,
it does,

257
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:56,211
is it measures heart rate variability.
And a central nervous system activity 

258
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:01,470
and the correlation between the two and 
whatever their algorithm is that they 

259
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,980
come up with to figure out,
you know,

260
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:04,010
the,
you know,

261
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,000
what,
what the correlation means.

262
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,780
They can,
you know,

263
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:09,710
you got a little dumb screen that shows 
you blue,

264
00:12:09,711 --> 00:12:11,770
blue or green,
yellow,

265
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,360
red as far as your trainability I can,
you know,

266
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,600
I can do strength and speed.
Uh,

267
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,600
but my,
my power and strength,

268
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,180
you know,
a level readiness is,

269
00:12:22,181 --> 00:12:23,620
is down.
And then so we,

270
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:26,440
we use that as a tool.
There's sometimes you just got to go.

271
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,660
Sometimes you've got to go old school 
and be like,

272
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:29,220
you know,
yeah,

273
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,160
you know,
this is,

274
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,320
this is fancy but I need to push through
the um,

275
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:38,510
but it's,
it's a tool to help mitigate 

276
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:38,510
overtraining.

277
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:38,510
Wow.
That's,

278
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:43,281
that's really fascinating.
So it seems like experience is probably 

279
00:12:43,281 --> 00:12:44,380
the most important thing then.
I think so.

280
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,360
I think so.
And that's hard though.

281
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,570
When I'm in training camp,
I'm like a race horse man,

282
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,040
I want to fucking run and I really need 
somebody to pull back the reigns.

283
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:57,580
And sometimes I can do that myself.
But sometimes I'm in fucking,

284
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,260
you know,
in shark frenzy mode,

285
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:00,280
I just go,
go,

286
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:00,760
go,
go,

287
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:02,300
go.
And uh,

288
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,410
you know,
and,

289
00:13:03,411 --> 00:13:04,430
and,
you know,

290
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:09,570
I have,
I have to have people around me to be 

291
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:09,570
like,
Hey,

292
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:09,570
no,
whoa,

293
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,160
ticket to you to kick back.
And your relationship with Irwin,

294
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,960
when you guys first started with how did
you work in the movement training with 

295
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,071
all the other stuff that you were doing?
Did you have like a specific day you'd 

296
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,071
say,
Hey,

297
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,380
we're going to meet on Tuesday and.

298
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,330
Yeah,
pretty much who's Day aside?

299
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,230
Pretty much,
yeah,

300
00:13:26,231 --> 00:13:27,610
we would go,
uh,

301
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:33,520
you know,
block out maybe three or four hours 

302
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,390
later in the week,
um,

303
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,710
and,
you know,

304
00:13:35,711 --> 00:13:37,330
just hit it and it wasn't always 
intense.

305
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:38,770
That was a cool thing about working with
Irwin.

306
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,890
It wasn't like physically intense.
It was um,

307
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,160
uh,
mentally and neurologically taxing.

308
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:48,070
So after we did this stuff,
I was absolutely wiped out,

309
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:48,870
but,
you know,

310
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,120
I got my heart rate up a little bit,
but these weren't hard work as they 

311
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,280
weren't taking anatomy physically.
That's interesting.

312
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:56,320
So what was,
what wiped you out about it?

313
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,320
Um,
I think it was,

314
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,130
we're training the neuromuscular system 
and we're training the,

315
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,660
um,
he could probably tell you more about it

316
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:08,680
than I than I can,
but,

317
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,090
um,
it was,

318
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,260
you know,
really,

319
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:13,500
really precise,
uh,

320
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:18,890
uh,
movements that just tax tax tax you 

321
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,320
neurologically.
And I'm like,

322
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:21,920
I don't know.

323
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,820
Well,
first of,

324
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:29,760
for so,
uh,

325
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:33,790
Carlos is surrounded by a war,
a team of world class people,

326
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:37,200
a person who was talking about Adrian 
have elevate I,

327
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:40,330
albuquerque is a strength and 
conditioning coach.

328
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:43,270
So he works specifically with him on 
this area,

329
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:48,290
this trending.
And then there is Brendan Gibson and 

330
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,671
then there's and Dale and of course 
there is Greg Jackson and when 

331
00:14:50,671 --> 00:14:50,800
controlling.
So,

332
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,040
um,
so me,

333
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,120
I had to,
uh,

334
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,510
to address areas of training that I 
believe the,

335
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:01,530
where we're lacking a.
If I was to find a word to describe what

336
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:03,710
we've been training with him,
I would say,

337
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:08,750
uh,
Carlos would have been training your 

338
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,481
brain because the number one reason why 
we have a brain from an evolutionary 

339
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:15,671
perspective is for movement.
It's not to discuss fine wine or the 

340
00:15:15,671 --> 00:15:16,640
history of art,
which is great.

341
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,870
But originally it's so about a year old 
can navigate,

342
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,880
uh,
through complex movement,

343
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,350
through complex environments.

344
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,850
That's the reason why we have a brain,
uh,

345
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,900
so intensity is not necessarily a 
raising the heart rate,

346
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,910
you know,
going real hard and burning all over.

347
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:39,970
Intensity can be in the mindfulness that
you apply to,

348
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:46,090
uh,
intentionally perform movement very 

349
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,031
specifically with a high level of 
efficiency that requires a level of 

350
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:53,730
focus that a challenges stimulates and 
help the,

351
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,610
the,
the connective,

352
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,990
uh,
functions grope as a matter of fact,

353
00:15:56,991 --> 00:16:01,940
movement itself is a major,
if not the major,

354
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,050
uh,
a secret or,

355
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:05,830
or,
or,

356
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:08,150
or reason for,
uh,

357
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:13,070
helping conductive functions.
It does a whole deal of,

358
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,930
of,
uh,

359
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,950
things,
uh,

360
00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:16,540
in the,
in,

361
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,760
you know,
processes in the brain that's going to,

362
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,110
uh,
to,

363
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:26,111
to,
to help it grow and what you acquire 

364
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,800
through movement transfers to any area 
of life.

365
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:32,830
But obviously transfers to better 
movement and better movement is not 

366
00:16:33,261 --> 00:16:36,720
always just more power,
more uh,

367
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,940
or new techniques.

368
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,800
I told Carlos,
Carlos,

369
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:43,100
listen,
you've been 20 for 13 years.

370
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,950
Your extremely seasoned,
extremely experienced.

371
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:51,340
And I bet that a,
you've tried a diverse modalities of 

372
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:51,780
training,
uh,

373
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:56,830
but that currently you are a,
every camp is pretty much the same in 

374
00:16:57,681 --> 00:17:02,681
term of preparation except what's 
specific to a game plane for a given 

375
00:17:02,681 --> 00:17:06,830
opponent.
So I said you might try to acquire more,

376
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:12,010
more power.
It's gonna take a lot of energy because 

377
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,330
you have already a lot of,
of,

378
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,090
of power for your while you're awake 
degree,

379
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,860
uh,
you may try to acquire more endurance,

380
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:25,030
uh,
but that's gonna be putting a lot of 

381
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,030
time,
a lot of energy to get that.

382
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,150
You can try to learn more techniques.
But do you have a hurry?

383
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,820
Know already.
So many techniques.

384
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,970
So one of the things that you can do is 
to,

385
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,600
to move better.
So any technique that you already know,

386
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,990
we wanted to perform them better.

387
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:44,050
Okay.
So what is involved in movement 

388
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:44,050
training?
So let's say it's day one,

389
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,820
you get a guy like,
uh,

390
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,790
and he says,
Hey,

391
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:47,810
uh,
uh,

392
00:17:47,811 --> 00:17:51,330
I love this idea that hooked me up.
Well,

393
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,120
uh,
in the case of Carlos,

394
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,460
it had to be something specific to him 
as a fighter to what I saw.

395
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:00,270
I saw,
you know,

396
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:05,370
what are his fortes is strong points,
but also saw what I believed were 

397
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,930
deficiencies.
Uh,

398
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,710
and that may seem presumptuous,
but when I talked to him about it,

399
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:14,340
what I saw that could be improved,
he said,

400
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:19,341
well,
that's exactly what I've been told for 

401
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:20,500
years by my coaches.
And what was that a thought that he's,

402
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:25,550
his stance was too high.
He used these two narrow slowly these 

403
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:25,550
particular,
you know,

404
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,380
uh,
typically Thai boxing square stance,

405
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,560
uh,
you know,

406
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:31,950
with his feet and the l shape,
um,

407
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,980
and um,
and to me that caused a ton of 

408
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,161
instabilities,
but also preventing him from being as 

409
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,570
fast as I believe he could be in moving 
in and out or,

410
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,540
or sideways.

411
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,440
So what adjustments did you make as far 
as the stance?

412
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,230
We,
we,

413
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,650
we move the position of his back foot is
orientated,

414
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,700
you know,
at a 90 degree angle.

415
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:57,990
So we moved it forward more at a 45 
degree angle.

416
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,350
But the problem when we did that,
when we have a square stance,

417
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:06,870
basically your feet are in line,
so if you move you are relatively stable

418
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:11,871
only because the foot is going that way 
that when you move it that way you,

419
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,510
you shrink a bit,
your,

420
00:19:13,511 --> 00:19:16,980
your base of support,
it creates even more instability.

421
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:20,790
So what you need to do is to have your 
feet wider to widen,

422
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,800
you know,
a bit wider on the,

423
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,340
on the,
the front or to the back and then to the

424
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,780
sites like something like,
uh,

425
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,770
uh,
with a shoulder width or her hip width.

426
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,300
So that was really a lot of when you,
when I was tweaking something,

427
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,150
it will,
it may create an,

428
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:43,100
a negative consequence that we had to do
a lot of drilling to,

429
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,970
to improve that stance,
to make it,

430
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:46,770
to make,
to make it better.

431
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:51,480
Now the stance that you developed a sort
of classics dance,

432
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,010
you know,
and you're a tall guy,

433
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:58,011
you would fight and stand up high.
Were there any issues when he started 

434
00:19:58,011 --> 00:20:01,860
adjusting the way you place your feet?
Or did you have to relearn things and.

435
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:02,700
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah,

436
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,690
without a doubt.
Um,

437
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,460
I've been,
I've been training,

438
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,500
you know,
uh,

439
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,510
we tired since I was 15 years old and so
yeah,

440
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,050
I mean these things have been,
uh,

441
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,810
you know,
have been a stratified in my,

442
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:20,310
in my fricking my muscle memory for,
for years.

443
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,330
Uh,
so yeah,

444
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,640
it took quite a bit of,
and I probably,

445
00:20:23,641 --> 00:20:25,920
you still see me going back to my old 
habits.

446
00:20:25,921 --> 00:20:30,921
You're going to,
especially when you're tired or you're 

447
00:20:30,921 --> 00:20:30,921
stressed or you're in different 
situations,

448
00:20:30,921 --> 00:20:31,890
you are going to revert back to the 
thing that you've trained the most.

449
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,040
But when I'm mindful of it for the most 
part,

450
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,150
um,
you know,

451
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,880
I,
I definitely think that the improvements

452
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:39,870
or the,
the,

453
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,950
the adjustments we made were,
uh,

454
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,470
were major improvements.
Um,

455
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,720
we also worked on,
instead of being real,

456
00:20:45,721 --> 00:20:48,100
real heavy on my front leg,
having more

457
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,360
of like an upright stance and upright 
stance as far as my torso and not,

458
00:20:52,361 --> 00:20:57,361
uh,
not being so heavy be more 50 slash 50 

459
00:20:57,361 --> 00:20:59,941
on my legs and that,
that allowed me to move in and out 

460
00:20:59,941 --> 00:21:00,130
faster.
Not only forward but,

461
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,540
but back.
Um,

462
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,720
and that showed big time in the fighting
is Tiago Elvis.

463
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,020
I think that was the reason I was able 
to get in,

464
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,640
get inside land with the elbows as 
effectively as I did and you know,

465
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,740
and then kind of,
you know,

466
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,430
get,
get the fight rolling.

467
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:20,670
We're seeing some,
I love watching different sort of 

468
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,930
patterns that are developing the fighter
start following.

469
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,200
But one of the things that we're seeing,
there's a lot of people that are 

470
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,051
standing and more of a karate stance,
more sideways and wider stance and that 

471
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,110
with that,
like sort of Leo Machida style a gunner,

472
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:38,260
Nelson likes to fight like that.
You can bounce conor Mcgregor,

473
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,520
you bounce in and out easier.
It seems like a,

474
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,300
a lighter foot print sort of stuff.

475
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:44,840
Damn.
Yeah.

476
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:47,140
And that's very much what we were aiming
at.

477
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,470
You know,
I executed the way that I do because I'm

478
00:21:50,471 --> 00:21:54,040
a flat footed kind of fucking goofy guy.
And I do,

479
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,720
I do my best,
you know,

480
00:21:55,721 --> 00:21:56,580
I'm,
you know,

481
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:01,610
I'm,
I'm lucky I got a hard head sometimes 

482
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:01,610
because I'm not Mr technique all the 
time.

483
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,940
Um,
but we definitely made an improvement.

484
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,540
I must say that working with Carlos and 
uh,

485
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:11,960
he's uh,
he's extremely focused actually when one

486
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,610
trend there wasn't like no,
it was like a zero fat kind of training,

487
00:22:15,611 --> 00:22:20,611
like completely,
entirely focused from the beginning to 

488
00:22:20,611 --> 00:22:22,600
the end.
Always really applied himself during the

489
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:25,720
training and I know that he drilled a 
lot also on these own,

490
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:30,930
in between every session to make those 
adjustments to make them become second 

491
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:35,821
nature because when you,
when you change any aspect of your 

492
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:37,810
technique,
at first it feels unnatural because your

493
00:22:37,811 --> 00:22:39,430
brain is,
you know,

494
00:22:39,431 --> 00:22:42,850
you have something,
a certain patterns that are ingrained in

495
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:46,800
your,
a neuromuscular memory and they are,

496
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,160
there are a little hard to change.

497
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:52,620
But Carlos was able to change things 
really fast actually.

498
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,830
And I was always impressed about how 
fast he would make those progresses.

499
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,540
And again,
those progress is,

500
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:03,180
were not up that much physical and you 
know,

501
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,470
in the sense of strength and 
conditioning,

502
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:08,940
like it would have to work hard to.
It it,

503
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:11,560
the,
the changes were always told him,

504
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:17,580
you have the body has it.
What you need is that that map being 

505
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,900
newer in your brain somewhere to really 
understand,

506
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:27,901
recognize,
identify and assimilate fully vet 

507
00:23:27,901 --> 00:23:30,400
particular pattern.
You've done so many movements,

508
00:23:30,401 --> 00:23:32,110
so many,
so much footwork,

509
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:37,111
so much,
but the way to do it requires a 

510
00:23:37,111 --> 00:23:39,880
different wiring between the mind and 
the body,

511
00:23:39,881 --> 00:23:41,980
between the brain and the body.

512
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,510
That's a big part of it,
right?

513
00:23:43,511 --> 00:23:45,980
Is just patterns.
Getting those patterns

514
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,580
ingrained in your system to the point 
where they come out automatically,

515
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,850
like you know,
those,

516
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:56,060
those movements that happen either 
inspiring or in competition where all of

517
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:59,600
a sudden you're executing something and 
you had zero thought.

518
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,360
It's just completely.
Your training takes over.

519
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,240
You slip upon and counter and you don't 
even.

520
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:10,420
There's no conscious thought at all and 
that has to sort of similarly be 

521
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:12,200
achieved through movement.

522
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,710
Exactly in that,
what's,

523
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,740
that's what stimulated Carla's brain 
that much that he had to take a nap 

524
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:23,271
after every training.
Whereas he's used to reread hard 

525
00:24:23,271 --> 00:24:23,790
trenton.
But with that training,

526
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:26,790
which is relatively low intensity and 
uh,

527
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:33,470
the brand is so stimulated that he needs
to recover because it needs to process 

528
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:36,750
while it is,
it's like if the movement,

529
00:24:36,751 --> 00:24:41,751
the mindful movement is the input that 
the body that the brain needs to do that

530
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,410
read circuiting a differently,
um,

531
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,480
and to,
uh,

532
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,880
to deconstruct old patterns,
replace them with newer,

533
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:59,090
more efficient butter.
And that didn't happen while we were 

534
00:24:59,090 --> 00:24:59,090
doing it.
You know,

535
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,450
while we were doing a lot of the times I
was struggling with this stuff.

536
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,710
Um,
but I'd go home and I would rest and I'd

537
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:07,680
go back to my room,
my regular training work a little bit on

538
00:25:07,681 --> 00:25:08,430
and not a whole lot.

539
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:11,550
But then the next time I would come back
it was almost as if my,

540
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:16,590
my,
my mind and my body had digested this 

541
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:20,121
stuff and assimilated and it put it into
practical application without like a 

542
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,740
unconsciously without me even really 
working on it too much.

543
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,790
Um,
you know,

544
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,880
he says that I,
that I would work in in the meantime 

545
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:31,880
between our sessions.
Sometimes I did.

546
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,210
Sometimes I didn't.
Sometimes I had a lot of their stuff,

547
00:25:33,211 --> 00:25:36,560
sometimes you do that,
um,

548
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,660
but it looked like I did,
um,

549
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,860
because I feel like,
and I,

550
00:25:41,861 --> 00:25:46,861
I think this is kind of a consensus that
you make gains,

551
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:54,110
you know,
during your rest you can lift and lift 

552
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,110
and lift and lift,
but if you never rest,

553
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,560
you're never going to make those gains.
The same thing with,

554
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,780
um,
with your technique and um,

555
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,430
you know,
this,

556
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,790
this,
this neurological training,

557
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,740
I think it's,
it works the exact same way

558
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:07,910
that is the whole movement that's going 
on right now is really fascinating 

559
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,790
because there's a bunch of different 
sort of branches of it.

560
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:15,830
Um,
and there's like what ido portal is 

561
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,330
doing is what you're doing,
but there's also a curse on is doing.

562
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:22,510
He's the guy who's just trying to get 
action coach for Fabry Silverdome and 

563
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:25,370
heartfelt dos Anjos.
And I had him on the podcast and I asked

564
00:26:25,371 --> 00:26:30,371
him like,
what is like one of the most important 

565
00:26:30,371 --> 00:26:31,820
things that fighters are lacking and 
that you try to improve on?

566
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:37,090
And he said foot strength.
And I found that to be really 

567
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,570
interesting and when I watched what you 
guys were doing,

568
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:43,780
a lot of this barefoot jumping and 
leaping and balancing and it requires 

569
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,100
some pretty

570
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:49,100
extreme foot stability is the number one
thing we addressed with car number one 

571
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:53,590
and number one,
I said your feet are not strong and 

572
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:53,850
they're not,
they're not smart enough,

573
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,790
not that that,
that fee to have a brain,

574
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,750
but there is a,
uh,

575
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:03,760
an extremely strong correlation between 
the proprioception in the foot and the 

576
00:27:04,741 --> 00:27:07,680
brain and movement.
So most of the time when we move,

577
00:27:07,681 --> 00:27:11,820
we're on our feet and that's the reason 
why there are so many sensors,

578
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:16,260
a nerve terminations in the feet,
thousands and thousands of them.

579
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:21,261
Why?
Because it's about intelligence 

580
00:27:21,261 --> 00:27:21,540
intelligence in the sense of 
information.

581
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,330
We talk about proprioception,
extra reception,

582
00:27:24,331 --> 00:27:29,331
which is the particular perception of a,
a given surface and to dixter and he's 

583
00:27:29,971 --> 00:27:31,460
asleep or reuse.
It does,

584
00:27:31,461 --> 00:27:33,300
it gives them traction and things like 
that.

585
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:34,410
Uh,
is it,

586
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,060
is it stable or shaky anyways?
So the moment you place your feet,

587
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:43,020
a boom sends information to the brain,
the brain processes,

588
00:27:43,021 --> 00:27:47,340
and gives order to all the rest of the 
body to shift the way to,

589
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,300
to,
uh,

590
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,100
just,
you know,

591
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,990
give some order,
some intention,

592
00:27:51,991 --> 00:27:56,430
it happens without you having to think 
about it and it happens extremely fast.

593
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:01,910
However,
the more you feed are sensitive in that 

594
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:06,501
sense,
the faster information travels up and 

595
00:28:06,501 --> 00:28:07,290
back down.
Uh,

596
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:12,291
and secondly also the stronger of foot 
is the more reliable your base of 

597
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:16,551
support is.
So we talk about the strength of the 

598
00:28:16,551 --> 00:28:20,841
foot.
We talk about the elasticity of the 

599
00:28:20,841 --> 00:28:21,280
muscles in the feet,
uh,

600
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,760
to,
to be sometimes more bouncy,

601
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,890
just simply faster,
uh,

602
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,980
to be also a more endurance to last 
longer with elasticy and speed.

603
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:37,590
Um,
and we did a lot of that through a 

604
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,300
balancing drills even like loaded 
balancing drills,

605
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:44,450
but also specific footwork drills and 
moving in and out in.

606
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,610
And it was not only a,
the footwork itself,

607
00:28:47,611 --> 00:28:52,611
it's also how the level of alertness 
that you have in relation to an open net

608
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:58,070
and the level of responsiveness that you
have in your movement in relation to 

609
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,530
open it because it's not just 
reinforcing a particular part of your 

610
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:04,530
body as if you're made of parts it,
it has to work as a whole.

611
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:09,560
We had to make sure that anything would 
improve specifically then would be 

612
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,490
brought back to the,
the whole spectrum,

613
00:29:11,491 --> 00:29:15,150
which is movement in a fight and work 
and actually improve.

614
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:20,420
And that's what Carlos did every time 
when you would go sparring and then he 

615
00:29:20,611 --> 00:29:23,640
would see by himself and then telling me
back,

616
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:29,210
I've improved.
These have improved that in my coach's 

617
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:29,750
seat too.
So the proof is in the pudding as,

618
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:34,200
as Carlos would always say it works.
You know,

619
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,320
most people would think that if you're a
fit guy and you're a strong guy and you 

620
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:39,960
know,
I'd say maybe you do squats or something

621
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:40,950
like that,
you'd have strong.

622
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,070
And

623
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,430
one of the things that shocked me the 
most when I started doing yoga is,

624
00:29:45,431 --> 00:29:47,740
that's what would give out.
It's my feet would give out.

625
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,960
I was like,
this is so bizarre.

626
00:29:49,961 --> 00:29:51,220
Like I felt like,
okay,

627
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:56,221
if I could stand on one foot,
like if you made me stand here on one 

628
00:29:56,221 --> 00:29:56,500
foot with my sneakers on,
it's not hard.

629
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,410
They'll stand on one foot.
Okay,

630
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,480
no big deal.
But when you're balancing my feet would 

631
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:03,480
fucking ache,
you know,

632
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,211
like you're doing like bow pose or 
something like that and you've got one 

633
00:30:08,211 --> 00:30:08,211
leg up here and your arm is stretched 
forward.

634
00:30:08,211 --> 00:30:11,260
And you were balancing my feet would be 
what was giving out.

635
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:15,580
And I started thinking about how little 
stability,

636
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:20,850
you know,
most people probably have from training 

637
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:21,250
with shoes on,
lifting weights,

638
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:22,390
with shoes on,
doing,

639
00:30:22,391 --> 00:30:24,970
running with big thick cushy shoes.

640
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:30,940
Even even elite elite athletes and even 
our elite MMA fighters.

641
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:36,280
And the reason why,
even even when they are training 

642
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,280
barefoot in Dojo or in teams.
Um,

643
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:41,570
but you have to think of what's the 
background of a given person.

644
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:46,220
Most people today in modern populations 
grow up indoors.

645
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,460
We have shoes on all the time.
We're walking,

646
00:30:49,461 --> 00:30:52,850
we're walking on flat.
Smooth surfaces are predictable.

647
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,220
There's no challenge to,
to the body.

648
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:58,100
There's no challenge to the feet.
The feet become numb,

649
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,010
feet become weak structurally.
And uh,

650
00:31:01,011 --> 00:31:01,640
and,
and,

651
00:31:01,641 --> 00:31:04,520
and,
and in term of strength in term of it,

652
00:31:04,521 --> 00:31:07,220
just sorta get a tissue.
Yeah.

653
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,650
So,
um,

654
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,840
if you try and MMA because you are 
getting to,

655
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,000
uh,
do uh,

656
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:14,730
you know,
say,

657
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,820
so striking move on your feet is going 
to help,

658
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:18,870
definitely is going to help your,
your food scraps,

659
00:31:18,871 --> 00:31:23,871
your foot mobility or stability,
but not as much as what you're going to 

660
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:28,110
gain when you have to balance,
uh,

661
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,560
uh,
on,

662
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:34,820
on narrow surfaces and ordinance certain
positions in certain transitions and 

663
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,910
kneeling and sitting and get up and get 
down.

664
00:31:36,911 --> 00:31:40,160
And especially we've loads on or at a 
certain pace,

665
00:31:40,161 --> 00:31:43,880
at a certain speed.
It's different.

666
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:48,560
And when you make the feet stronger than
your footwork is stronger.

667
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:51,210
When we talk about movement coaching,
uh,

668
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:56,290
some people are confused because when 
they hear movement in relation to 

669
00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:00,100
fighting the footwork and it is work,
but it's also more than that.

670
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:03,800
Do you remember a few years back,
uh,

671
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:08,830
it was all the rage you,
you're hearing about a lot of nfl 

672
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,130
players were doing ballet.
Do you remember this?

673
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:15,110
It was a big deal.
Like people will like mocking it,

674
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,120
joking around about it.
And I remember thinking,

675
00:32:17,121 --> 00:32:18,650
man,
that is really interesting.

676
00:32:18,651 --> 00:32:23,651
Very smart.
They must have some sort of benefit in 

677
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:24,890
that if they're doing it.
But if you think about ballet,

678
00:32:24,891 --> 00:32:29,891
the movements are incredibly difficult 
and especially if you're a 260 pound 

679
00:32:29,891 --> 00:32:33,160
fucking stud athlete covered in muscles.
It's like if you're a thing,

680
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:38,190
like there was a guy that was in a yoga 
class where he leaves his former 

681
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:38,290
football player,
real big guys like six,

682
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:43,310
four and real thick and heavy and it's 
so much harder for him to do these 

683
00:32:43,821 --> 00:32:46,610
movements and say like a girl who weighs
100 pounds,

684
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,300
it's like a castle in the sand 
inaccurately standard.

685
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:53,050
It's like an Achilles food.
It's a,

686
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:58,070
you have a whole mountain that's,
that's built on on the very weak 

687
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:01,591
foundations and ballet of even for nfl 
players was actually a very smart move 

688
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:04,690
because when you look at the strength of
the,

689
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,770
the,
the cows,

690
00:33:05,771 --> 00:33:10,040
I had a cousin who was a professional,
a denser,

691
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,190
uh,
her,

692
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:15,970
her cows or bootstrap was completely 
amazing because,

693
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,570
you know,
they do these gracious movement.

694
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:23,610
People see the grace,
but they make extraordinarily movement 

695
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:23,610
look easy,
but they're not

696
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:28,620
like floor gymnast too,
I would imagine because they have to 

697
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,740
stick your,
your foot has to have the ability to 

698
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,771
catch you and then just stay in that 
position completely locked.

699
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:38,640
Then you absorb of foot,
ankle,

700
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,590
knee,
hip stability,

701
00:33:40,591 --> 00:33:41,700
core stability.
I mean,

702
00:33:41,701 --> 00:33:42,150
it,
it,

703
00:33:42,151 --> 00:33:43,140
all,
it starts,

704
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:45,570
starts in the foot.
I'm balanced.

705
00:33:45,571 --> 00:33:48,540
I mean it's,
everything is integrated of course.

706
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,370
Um,
but it,

707
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,280
it starts to feet.

708
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,460
I saw you doing some of the countdown 
shows.

709
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,800
You were doing a lot of jumping over 
things,

710
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:01,970
standing and jumping onto a board and 
landing on like,

711
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,670
it looks like a two by four or something
like that.

712
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:08,940
And locking in place on that.
And it was pretty impressive stuff 

713
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:08,940
because there it is right here,
Jamie,

714
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,620
how you're on the ball,
but like this kind of stuff,

715
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,310
like when you were doing these kinds of 
movements,

716
00:34:15,311 --> 00:34:15,610
like,
look,

717
00:34:15,611 --> 00:34:18,130
you'd see it here on this.
How did you,

718
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:23,160
how do you design these Erewhon and like
what are you looking for different 

719
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,600
things specific to Carlos

720
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,560
hundred percent specific to Carlos 
because that's the point.

721
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:33,880
A movement coaching for lack of better 
term.

722
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:39,750
Um,
it's not giving a fighter random 

723
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,400
movements that are not fighting 
movements,

724
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:43,450
[inaudible],
Bollywood,

725
00:34:43,451 --> 00:34:48,280
dancing or whatever for a tight.
She couldn't be anything.

726
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:50,980
It could be any movement.
Movement is such a very.

727
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:55,720
It's a vast world or universe.
If you're lucky,

728
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:57,910
you're gonna,
you're gonna.

729
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:03,050
If you'd give something randomly,
you're going to find something that 

730
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:03,050
happens to be useful.
But in,

731
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:07,210
in the case of Carlos,
I looked at his fights and analyze these

732
00:35:07,211 --> 00:35:08,890
movement.
I had some,

733
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,590
some,
some intuitions about what was there,

734
00:35:11,591 --> 00:35:15,670
what was missing.
And then Isaiah was draining him.

735
00:35:15,671 --> 00:35:19,570
I was constantly adjusting the movement 
programs.

736
00:35:19,571 --> 00:35:23,230
What was in every session to what I saw 
was working,

737
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,280
what was not working.
What I,

738
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,240
depending on the level of progress that 
it wasn't making,

739
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:31,960
we would do something more difficult or 
are the higher level of intensity.

740
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,670
It's,
it's tailored,

741
00:35:33,671 --> 00:35:35,560
it's customized,
not random.

742
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,010
How did you develop this program?
This

743
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:42,750
is very interesting because I would 
imagine that you would get athletes from

744
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:44,550
a bunch of different sports that would 
come to you,

745
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:46,620
right?
No,

746
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,300
no.
I'm not looking.

747
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,220
I told Carlos,
Carlos,

748
00:35:50,221 --> 00:35:53,250
listen,
I'm focusing harper sent on you,

749
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,700
right?
There is no other athlete that I want to

750
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,060
travel like a gym.
Right?

751
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:01,330
I mean you have this move.
Nat Is this company of this website?

752
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,910
Yeah.
We have a,

753
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,540
we have thousands of certified trainers 
who are using our methods,

754
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:09,320
thousands of trainers.
I think somewhere around $3,000

755
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:14,190
to run the wellness world.
The company since 2009.

756
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,720
So this is all your creation.
You've developed this all yourself.

757
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,270
My method,
the method is my creation,

758
00:36:21,271 --> 00:36:24,000
but however I do draw from,
uh,

759
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:28,350
from the history of physical education,
which I have studied a lot,

760
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:33,390
especially what comes from Europe and in
my case because I'm originally from 

761
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:33,750
France,
uh,

762
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:38,970
they used to be a method called a 
natural method by a guy called Georgia 

763
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:43,140
bear who himself was not.
He was seen as a pioneer,

764
00:36:43,141 --> 00:36:45,510
but he himself was,
you know,

765
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:50,540
at some point of that long line of 
people before him was a morrows and 

766
00:36:51,361 --> 00:36:56,361
pistol lindsay and mercury.
A lot of guys who were working on these 

767
00:36:56,361 --> 00:36:58,760
different methods,
but we're talking a,

768
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,710
a 20th century,
19th century,

769
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,660
18th century,
and before and before,

770
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:08,661
and before,
and back then people didn't have 

771
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:10,710
exercise science.
So what is it that they were training.

772
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:14,460
They were training the most down to 
earth,

773
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,130
practical movements.
They would jump,

774
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,830
they would run,
they would crawl,

775
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,740
they will lift and carry things and 
throw and catch things.

776
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:28,430
Why?
Because these are the movements that 

777
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,861
people needed back then that they were 
in the military or firefighters.

778
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:37,610
And when you look at it today,
if there's a situation that say 

779
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:43,040
potentially life threatening,
these are still the movements that you 

780
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,940
need to do to save your life or to save 
somebody else's life.

781
00:37:44,941 --> 00:37:46,590
They're extremely,
they're natural,

782
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:49,380
but they're natural also to the point 
that they are vital.

783
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,150
So you have this gym,
right?

784
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,530
Um,
what,

785
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,900
what is your normal clientele?
Like?

786
00:37:54,901 --> 00:37:57,020
The normal person that comes to a move 
net,

787
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:57,390
Jim,

788
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,110
it's impossible to a shrink to a 
particular category because

789
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:07,160
do you get like housewives?
You get athletes of all sports?

790
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,180
Yes.
Yes.

791
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,300
All than young men and women.
Woman comes in,

792
00:38:11,301 --> 00:38:12,560
she's an,
she's a housewife.

793
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:18,490
Women hate that fucking expression.
A woman comes in who's a non 

794
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:21,961
professional athlete who's just looking 
to get back in shape maybe after having 

795
00:38:21,961 --> 00:38:22,100
a baby.
Like what?

796
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,950
Do you design a protocol specifically 
for her?

797
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,400
Is that what you would do?
Yeah,

798
00:38:26,401 --> 00:38:29,330
it's a lot of classes,
like the movements,

799
00:38:29,331 --> 00:38:30,360
there are some movements

800
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:35,200
that are a fundamental movements that 
anybody can do a.

801
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:40,290
and then you have more advanced movement
and then you have say a simple jump.

802
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:46,170
You see Carlos jumping,
like this woman you're talking about 

803
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,590
won't be able to do that.
Yes,

804
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:51,010
you will,
but not at the same level of intensity.

805
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:51,990
Right?
Oh,

806
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I see.
So you would have her do it alleged 

807
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,271
shorter jumps over lower jump on the 
spot where he jumped two inches above 

808
00:39:00,761 --> 00:39:03,760
ground and lend in the same spot where 
you were standing to inches.

809
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:05,710
I think she could do for.
Have you got a pusher?

810
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,030
Yeah,
exactly.

811
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,090
Well it just needs to keep the training.
Got It.

812
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,790
You know,
never too hard,

813
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,750
too easy.
That was actually also my concern when I

814
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:21,751
started to try and Carlos because he was
recovering and I was extremely worried 

815
00:39:21,751 --> 00:39:25,741
that I wouldn't do anything that would 
compromise these recovery in any way 

816
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,750
that would actually help him recover 
even even faster.

817
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,060
So a method,
you have a method,

818
00:39:31,061 --> 00:39:36,061
only one.
It's scalable and also when it is 

819
00:39:36,061 --> 00:39:36,520
progressive and because these movements 
are natural,

820
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,390
they belong to all of us.
Like it's like,

821
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:45,560
um,
what would be the best way to train a 

822
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:45,750
wild tiger?
Like,

823
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,910
can you imagine that you're going to try
to isolate their,

824
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:54,210
you know,
their hang legs and then try to have 

825
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,510
them do another workout for the front 
legs and then put them on the,

826
00:39:55,511 --> 00:39:57,160
on the,
uh,

827
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,400
treadmill for cardio.
But I wouldn't make any sense.

828
00:40:00,401 --> 00:40:05,401
That would be hilarious because to be 
optimally strong and that Joel and like 

829
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:07,180
a good hunter,
a good Predator,

830
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,080
the well tiger just needs to be and 
behave and move like a wall tiger in its

831
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,700
original environment.
But could it be any different?

832
00:40:15,701 --> 00:40:20,701
Tiger on an inverted treadmill and 
really pushed that motherfucker some 

833
00:40:20,701 --> 00:40:22,900
good music on maybe some motivational 
videos,

834
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,530
heater up a drug,
a drug go tiger.

835
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:27,010
Uh,
well,

836
00:40:27,011 --> 00:40:28,120
you know,
they do that with,

837
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:30,340
with pit bulls.
Pit Bulls.

838
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:33,610
When they train them for fighting,
they put them on treadmills.

839
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,420
It's a,
they put them on a,

840
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,210
a treadmill that sort of self propelled 
the animals propelling the treadmill and

841
00:40:40,211 --> 00:40:42,430
they'll put something in front of it 
that it wants to get to.

842
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:45,340
So exercise science for four pit bulls.
Yeah.

843
00:40:45,341 --> 00:40:46,900
Well it's a,
it's a real thing.

844
00:40:46,901 --> 00:40:48,040
I mean they sell these.
Yeah,

845
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:49,520
they wanted,
they have weigh ins,

846
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,600
a serious moment.
Why not?

847
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:57,130
But my point was everybody needs the 
fundamental of,

848
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,680
I believe everybody needs the 
fundamental of,

849
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:05,100
of movements before you go through a 
very specific science based exercise 

850
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:09,100
for,
for anybody.

851
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,280
Uh,
most people don't need that.

852
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:14,450
Most people just need to move in the 
first place.

853
00:41:14,451 --> 00:41:16,360
There's only men move.
It can't even squat.

854
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:21,840
Most people are just sedentary.
They're just sitting on offices and 

855
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,650
cubicles or what happened,
the cause of most of their,

856
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:28,700
uh,
physical ailments is that improper 

857
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:28,930
movement behavior,
lack of movement,

858
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:34,160
or to specialize movement and the lack 
of diversity and the good things that,

859
00:41:35,391 --> 00:41:40,190
the antidote for that is movement.
Also movement behaviors,

860
00:41:40,191 --> 00:41:45,191
movement behavior is the cause and the 
solution to a lot of physical issues.

861
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:45,820
Yeah.

862
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,720
When you think about it,
what do we do?

863
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,210
We fucking stand.
We sit,

864
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:51,920
we lay,
we bend.

865
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,480
That's about it.
That's like four,

866
00:41:53,481 --> 00:41:55,730
four things right throughout our day,
you know,

867
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,770
and that,
that is so,

868
00:41:57,771 --> 00:42:01,490
so narrow of a movement spectrum 
compared to what should we do.

869
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,230
We should throw,
we should run,

870
00:42:03,231 --> 00:42:04,160
we should catch,
we could,

871
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,870
should swim.
We should bounce,

872
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:08,090
we should pull,
we should carry,

873
00:42:08,091 --> 00:42:10,670
we should fight,
we could all,

874
00:42:10,671 --> 00:42:15,671
all this a variety of things that the 
human body is supposed to do.

875
00:42:16,341 --> 00:42:19,790
And yet we are like in these constraints
of our,

876
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:20,690
you know,
we have chairs,

877
00:42:20,691 --> 00:42:22,420
we're sitting here on fucking chairs 
for,

878
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:24,270
there was chairs or fucking,
you know,

879
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,240
a low,
low squat or kneel or,

880
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,520
you know,
um,

881
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:31,680
there's a,
there's also the,

882
00:42:31,681 --> 00:42:36,681
the,
the neurological benefit of doing those 

883
00:42:37,491 --> 00:42:39,590
things because to,
for you to,

884
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:40,710
um,
to,

885
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:44,750
to move that way your body has,
or your brain has to do it for you.

886
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,060
Be Fire those stamps.
We're not,

887
00:42:47,061 --> 00:42:48,400
we're not doing that by,
you know,

888
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,090
this,
this boring as shit you or,

889
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,840
or even if we're a fit,
you know,

890
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,580
we're still laying.
We're still,

891
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,240
we were sitting on machines.
I'm doing,

892
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,020
uh,
you know,

893
00:42:57,021 --> 00:42:58,700
uh,
elevated,

894
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,720
you know,
whatever.

895
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:00,490
Um,

896
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:02,660
or something.
Yeah,

897
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:03,830
it's,
it's,

898
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:07,100
we're still kind of isolated and very 
minimal.

899
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:10,730
Very minimal.
We were not supposed to be like that.

900
00:43:10,731 --> 00:43:12,710
We're supposed to fucking move.
Exactly the,

901
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,130
the,
the,

902
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:18,430
even the people who who are brave enough
to go against the inertia of normalcy,

903
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:23,060
um,
and go to the gym and they will exercise

904
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:28,061
with machines.
I see a huge problem with that type 

905
00:43:28,061 --> 00:43:32,261
machines because machines dictates your 
movement,

906
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:34,550
shrinks.
It,

907
00:43:34,551 --> 00:43:36,030
shapes it.
Uh,

908
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:41,510
you have no choice.
You follow a very simplified pattern 

909
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:43,560
that's imposed by the machine,
right?

910
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,760
This is not who you are.
This is not what she's supposed to be 

911
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:48,760
and move like,
yeah,

912
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,260
because you're supposed to be highly 
adaptable in the way you move.

913
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:54,320
But when you do try to isolate your 
muscles,

914
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:57,050
you're treating yourself like you're 
fricking machine.

915
00:43:57,051 --> 00:44:02,051
It's like a factory when you should be 
like a wild forest or permaculture 

916
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:07,750
garden or something like that.
It's not what you're designed by 

917
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:12,470
evolution or creation,
whatever to do.

918
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,250
And so bringing it back around to mma,
it,

919
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,190
stepping in the octagon to,
to fighting,

920
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:23,460
you know,
the nature of our sport has so many 

921
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:23,680
different variables.
I mean,

922
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:25,390
anything can happen.
We go through,

923
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,510
you know,
we're using various energy systems.

924
00:44:28,511 --> 00:44:29,710
We go from,
you know,

925
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:34,711
going a Arabic to anaerobic to using an 
isometric hold all the way back through,

926
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,150
you know,
so,

927
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,200
so many different things involved 
because basically we're able to do 

928
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:42,420
whatever the fuck we want it with,
uh,

929
00:44:42,421 --> 00:44:45,120
you know,
under a very limited amount of rules.

930
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:48,840
So training this way just just makes 
sense.

931
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:51,480
Um,
because it's,

932
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:55,020
it's,
it's much more a along the lines of what

933
00:44:55,021 --> 00:44:56,850
we're actually going to do in 
competition.

934
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:02,120
How much of a factor is flexibility play
and how often do you train flexibility.

935
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,870
A lot of,
a lot of,

936
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,800
so flexibility's is,
is huge.

937
00:45:10,801 --> 00:45:15,801
Mobility is huge because the more 
mobility and you can explore,

938
00:45:16,951 --> 00:45:20,250
manifest physically have full range of 
motion,

939
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:25,251
but it's also plays a huge role in how 
relaxed you are and therefore how much 

940
00:45:26,851 --> 00:45:29,040
power you can generate.
And that's actually what was the,

941
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:34,390
uh,
one of the main point of focus on the 

942
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:34,800
second camp that we did for the fight 
for robey.

943
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:40,010
Um,
so we established a strategy I proposed 

944
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:43,680
as a movement strategy to Carlos and he,
he,

945
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:44,610
he,
he,

946
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:48,090
he,
when he talked to Greg Jackson about his

947
00:45:48,091 --> 00:45:49,020
game plane,
they,

948
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:54,150
they came up with the same thing and 
that was to use his ranch to always keep

949
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:56,880
control of the ranch and therefore 
two's,

950
00:45:56,950 --> 00:46:01,950
he's,
he's reached through using these kicks 

951
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:04,700
more and better and um,
we had to address some,

952
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:07,990
some deficiencies in flexibility because
what we,

953
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:13,050
what we,
what we noticed right away is that when 

954
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:16,041
you was a,
when Carlos was trying to reach a 

955
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:16,041
certain height,
uh,

956
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:17,040
he had to somewhat go a little beyond 
these,

957
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:20,140
his bag then current level of immune 
height.

958
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:21,960
Yes.
Yes.

959
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,830
And so when you try to somewhat forced 
solidity or mobility,

960
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,630
what creates instability and,
and,

961
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:32,670
and slows down the movement and then you
also lose this occurs in power and 

962
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:33,780
accuracy.
So we did tons of,

963
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:39,080
of stretching,
but we did that stretching through 

964
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,380
natural movements through all lot of 
movement on the ground and,

965
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:44,640
and um,
yeah,

966
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:46,140
for those natural patterns.

967
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:48,920
So I think,
uh,

968
00:46:48,921 --> 00:46:53,921
and you know,
tell me if you agree in MMA as opposed 

969
00:46:53,921 --> 00:46:58,631
to traditional martial arts.
I think we skip over a lot of the 

970
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:01,610
intricacies because I know you're a 
martial artist,

971
00:47:01,611 --> 00:47:02,120
you're,
you know,

972
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:06,950
you're,
you came up in taekwondo and I feel like

973
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,290
traditional martial arts really 
emphasized,

974
00:47:09,291 --> 00:47:12,090
you don't go past this point until 
you've mastered this,

975
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:17,110
this thing.
And it's very a very specialized in mma.

976
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:23,630
I think we get a guy and he's got a 
wrestling background.

977
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:26,240
Uh,
we'll teach him a little bit of boxing.

978
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:31,360
Um,
we won't get him necessarily super 

979
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,701
crisp,
teach them how to stab a few 

980
00:47:33,701 --> 00:47:33,701
submissions,
you know,

981
00:47:33,701 --> 00:47:36,950
get him real strong,
get them in shape and then put them out 

982
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:39,691
there and let him go with intensity.
And a lot of times that'll carry a lot 

983
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:43,411
of guys to the top levels and yet 
they've missed some of these smaller,

984
00:47:44,651 --> 00:47:47,710
um,
basic nuts and bolts kind of thing with,

985
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,610
with the movement.

986
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:52,420
And I think that going back to I'm in 
that,

987
00:47:52,421 --> 00:47:54,050
that's all good.
That's all well and good.

988
00:47:54,051 --> 00:47:54,430
I,
you know,

989
00:47:54,431 --> 00:47:56,140
you need,
you need that mix of stuff.

990
00:47:56,141 --> 00:47:59,080
You need the intensity,
you need to be able to get out there and

991
00:47:59,081 --> 00:48:01,900
bring in by down on your mouthpiece and 
throw down when it,

992
00:48:01,901 --> 00:48:03,010
when,
when the time comes,

993
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:08,460
but if you have that,
you can always go back and work on that 

994
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:12,271
other stuff.
That's what I feel like I did quite a 

995
00:48:12,271 --> 00:48:12,271
bit with,
uh,

996
00:48:12,271 --> 00:48:12,500
with Irwin is,
you know,

997
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:15,510
I'm making these tweaks on these,
uh,

998
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:18,250
these very fundamental things that had 
been,

999
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,360
had been skipped over because,
you know,

1000
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:22,460
I'm Kinda,
I'm built.

1001
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:26,200
I got,
I got the fighter thing here and you put

1002
00:48:26,201 --> 00:48:29,410
me against whoever I'm to,
I'm going to fucking go,

1003
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,490
but now let's refine,
refine,

1004
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:37,510
less refined and,
and maximize and maximize the potential 

1005
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:39,760
of what I can do.

1006
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:43,360
Yeah.
It seems like almost having that kind of

1007
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:44,770
go go,
go mentality,

1008
00:48:44,771 --> 00:48:49,771
that fighter mentality.
It's obviously a huge benefit when 

1009
00:48:49,771 --> 00:48:51,430
you're in a fight,
but it almost seems like maybe sometimes

1010
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:56,460
it's against your benefit when you're 
training because when you're training 

1011
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:00,040
you almost should be looking at it like 
a science do.

1012
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:05,130
You almost should be looking at,
instead of like just trying to be the 

1013
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:07,531
toughest guy in the room,
you should almost be looking at it like 

1014
00:49:07,531 --> 00:49:10,471
you're building a castle and you have to
make sure the foundation is good and in 

1015
00:49:10,471 --> 00:49:15,331
traditional martial arts you have your 
white belt techniques and then you know 

1016
00:49:15,331 --> 00:49:17,890
as you develop in the ranks and you get 
new new belts,

1017
00:49:17,891 --> 00:49:22,891
you move up and you get a higher ranks.
One of the things you say you get a 

1018
00:49:22,891 --> 00:49:23,950
higher techniques are more difficult 
techniques,

1019
00:49:23,951 --> 00:49:28,120
but one of the things you see in mma is 
there's guys that have mastered,

1020
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,210
like truly mastered one particular 
aspect of MMA.

1021
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:36,210
Like Damien Maia is perfect example.
These are legitimate jujitsu master 

1022
00:49:36,281 --> 00:49:41,281
world champion and because of that his,
his specialty is so strong that he,

1023
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:48,450
when he gets to that spot,
he just got this massive advantage over 

1024
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:52,531
almost anybody.
And you see that when he fights like 

1025
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,420
really good guys.
You know like Gunnar Nelson.

1026
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:56,920
Nelson's a motherfucker,
a motherfucker on the ground yet,

1027
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:02,100
but Damien so goddamn good like neil 
magnets and other one neil magnet is so 

1028
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,160
good.
He's so tough and so,

1029
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:08,400
so good at avoiding submissions is 
defense is excellent and Damien just ran

1030
00:50:08,501 --> 00:50:13,501
right through them and he runs right 
through him because his technique is 

1031
00:50:13,501 --> 00:50:17,380
Samurai's sword sharp and he has 
polished it down and then now he's 

1032
00:50:18,191 --> 00:50:23,191
learned all the other stuff.
He's learned kickboxing and in the 

1033
00:50:23,191 --> 00:50:25,351
beginning you didn't have that and 
that's why like nate marquardt knocked 

1034
00:50:25,351 --> 00:50:25,660
him out or all these other guys were,
were able to beat him.

1035
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:28,640
He just didn't have those,
the standup skills.

1036
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:30,650
He didn't have all the other attributes 
of,

1037
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:35,680
of MMA,
but that one thing he had honed to like 

1038
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,461
sort of a mastery level,
whereas some guys never get to that in 

1039
00:50:39,461 --> 00:50:39,461
anything.
They're really good at everything,

1040
00:50:39,461 --> 00:50:41,270
but they never get to a mastery level in
anything.

1041
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:42,180
Yeah.
Yeah.

1042
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,120
And I would,
I mean,

1043
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,780
I would say that that's probably me.
I'm,

1044
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,730
I'm good at a lot of different things.
Um,

1045
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:54,070
maybe not a master at necessarily 
anything stand up is pretty high level.

1046
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:55,720
Pretty high level.
Yeah.

1047
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:59,380
You know,
you stand up pretty much anybody,

1048
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:00,400
you know,

1049
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,720
I,
I put your standup at a very high level,

1050
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,700
but you know,
your submissions are very good too,

1051
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:09,730
man,
but if you spent five years it did 

1052
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:14,051
nothing but you Jitsu every day and 
started competing in the Monday aisles 

1053
00:51:14,051 --> 00:51:18,290
and Abu Dhabi and Naga and all that shit
and who knows what the fuck your Jujitsu

1054
00:51:18,291 --> 00:51:18,710
it'd be like,

1055
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,970
which sounds awesome.
I mean,

1056
00:51:19,971 --> 00:51:21,710
yeah,
when I was coming up,

1057
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:25,370
Greg Jackson's gym now is very much a,
you know,

1058
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,570
seen as kind of kickboxing strike lots 
and lots of striking some,

1059
00:51:29,571 --> 00:51:30,490
some,
uh,

1060
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,480
some wrestling,
some Jiu Jitsu,

1061
00:51:32,481 --> 00:51:37,481
but mainly striking.
Right back in the day when I first 

1062
00:51:37,481 --> 00:51:38,570
started with Greg and his,
his system and his affiliates,

1063
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:42,070
it was mainly a grappling school.
It was guided Jitsu,

1064
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:42,910
right?
Oh,

1065
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,960
Jitsu,
yes sir.

1066
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:46,050
Created.
Yeah.

1067
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:48,590
Um,
well him and some other guys kind of got

1068
00:51:48,591 --> 00:51:52,460
together and created this thing.
Does he still call it that or is that.

1069
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:53,570
No,
no,

1070
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:54,800
it's,
that's history,

1071
00:51:54,801 --> 00:51:55,480
man.
That's just,

1072
00:51:55,530 --> 00:52:00,530
that's old school stuff.
I don't know how the fuck I still 

1073
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:00,530
remember that.
Um,

1074
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:02,930
but you know,
a guy like Keith Jardine,

1075
00:52:02,931 --> 00:52:06,230
who by the time he got into the UFC was 
kickbox and everybody,

1076
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:09,560
when I first met Keith,
Keith was a Jujitsu Guy,

1077
00:52:09,561 --> 00:52:14,561
man.
He was competing and in the advanced 

1078
00:52:14,561 --> 00:52:14,561
level at these,
uh,

1079
00:52:14,561 --> 00:52:18,550
uh,
grapplers quest tournaments and that 

1080
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:18,550
sort of thing.
And then kind of got away from that.

1081
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:20,180
Um,
and you know,

1082
00:52:20,181 --> 00:52:24,380
I think my first 12 or 12 or 13 wins or 
something,

1083
00:52:24,381 --> 00:52:29,381
we're,
we're by submission and now I haven't 

1084
00:52:29,381 --> 00:52:29,381
had a submission in years.
Yeah.

1085
00:52:29,381 --> 00:52:34,090
So I'm just got away from that and I 
think the sport kind of evolves and then

1086
00:52:36,561 --> 00:52:39,970
it comes full circle,
like it goes one way and then,

1087
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,620
and then the other and you see that 
with,

1088
00:52:41,621 --> 00:52:41,660
with

1089
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,340
fighters as well.
Like Paul felder's,

1090
00:52:43,341 --> 00:52:48,341
perfect example,
kids is excellent striker and he had 

1091
00:52:48,341 --> 00:52:51,140
couple really close decision losses to 
Barboza and Ross Pearson.

1092
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:56,380
And then he wins his next fight by 
submission and attacked with another 

1093
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,740
submission before he got the rear naked 
choke.

1094
00:52:57,741 --> 00:52:59,870
You almost got him in a gay teen.
Like you see guys going,

1095
00:52:59,871 --> 00:53:01,970
hey,
there's other ways to skin a cat.

1096
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:07,020
Like I gotta I gotta figure out how to 
be more predictable or unpredictable 

1097
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:11,111
rather.
And I think that that's one of the real 

1098
00:53:11,111 --> 00:53:11,111
problems with guys who were specialists 
strikers,

1099
00:53:11,111 --> 00:53:13,550
is that when you fight a guy who's a 
specialist striker,

1100
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:15,620
you know that he's not going to be 
shooting on you.

1101
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,240
So you're more relaxed,
you know,

1102
00:53:17,241 --> 00:53:19,100
you can loosen your legs up a little 
bit.

1103
00:53:19,101 --> 00:53:20,210
You know,
your footwork,

1104
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:22,700
your stance takes a different position 
because you're not,

1105
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:25,160
you're not squared off always looking to
sprawl,

1106
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:25,990
hit under hugs.

1107
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,480
Yeah,
absolutely.

1108
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,760
And you know,
you bring that up in.

1109
00:53:29,761 --> 00:53:33,690
That makes me think about my last fight.
You know,

1110
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,190
I'm,
I'm a well rounded fighter,

1111
00:53:35,191 --> 00:53:38,800
but I said I went in there and had a 
kickboxing fight with Robbie.

1112
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,890
Um,
well I thought that would actually be to

1113
00:53:40,891 --> 00:53:45,390
your benefit because what I said in the 
pre fight thing was that you,

1114
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:48,480
you issues you've had in the past with 
guys who have been able to hold onto you

1115
00:53:48,481 --> 00:53:53,481
and grab you down like Hendrix and that,
that might be a benefit to you in the 

1116
00:53:53,851 --> 00:53:55,710
Robbie lawler fight because fucking 
Robbie,

1117
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:57,360
just,
he's a gladiator.

1118
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,840
I mean that dude,
he is so rare in that regard.

1119
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:04,410
He what you see is what you get that 
guy,

1120
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:09,411
you know,
he is all bike down the mouthpiece and 

1121
00:54:09,411 --> 00:54:09,750
move forward and he's got excellent 
technique and he's.

1122
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:12,330
She's fucking tough as nails,
but he's a born fighter.

1123
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,070
Born funds.
Well,

1124
00:54:14,071 --> 00:54:17,040
that's why that fight was so good 
between you guys that last round,

1125
00:54:17,041 --> 00:54:18,390
man.
Jesus Christ.

1126
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:21,570
When the fucking round was over and you 
guys both put your arms on the cage.

1127
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:23,250
You.
That was the.

1128
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:28,340
That was the perfect example of leaving 
it all in the octagon.

1129
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:30,600
Yeah.
You guys just emptied out the tank.

1130
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:35,370
You were on fumes and then the Buzzer 
rang and you both did the same thing.

1131
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,400
When the fuck is that ever happened?
I don't think that's ever happened in a 

1132
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,510
fight with the fights over and both guys
just walk to the cage.

1133
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:43,770
He didn't hug each other like that 
fucking happened.

1134
00:54:43,771 --> 00:54:44,880
Later.
I can look at this.

1135
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:46,680
Look at this picture right there.
That's you guys.

1136
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:49,020
That's fucking never happened man.
I've never seen that.

1137
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:50,730
I wasn't conscious of that at that 
point.

1138
00:54:50,731 --> 00:54:54,330
I think I was on oxygen deprived.
Hypoxic,

1139
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:56,560
yeah,
probably mildly concussed.

1140
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,750
Taking shots.
That was a fucking amazing fight.

1141
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:04,680
It was an amazing fight and it was an 
amazing round.

1142
00:55:04,681 --> 00:55:07,440
That fifth round was just goddamn chaos 
mean.

1143
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:12,860
That to me is all of the scariest 
aspects of mma as far as damage and you 

1144
00:55:14,551 --> 00:55:19,551
know,
what you guys are doing to each other 

1145
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,520
and all the greatest aspects of mma as 
far as like display of heart and courage

1146
00:55:20,521 --> 00:55:25,521
and willpower and just determination 
because you had to be burning.

1147
00:55:25,711 --> 00:55:27,570
I mean everything.
What was it like in there?

1148
00:55:27,571 --> 00:55:28,290
That fifth round?

1149
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:33,990
I came out and I was,
I was feeling good.

1150
00:55:33,991 --> 00:55:37,670
I think I came out and finishing that 
fourth round I finished strong.

1151
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,850
Almost almost had him finished.
Um,

1152
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,330
in that fifth round I knew that he was 
going to come out like,

1153
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,670
you know,
like a bat out of hell.

1154
00:55:44,671 --> 00:55:47,380
So I wanted to finish strong.
And you never know what the,

1155
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:49,080
what the judge.
I didn't know where I was.

1156
00:55:49,081 --> 00:55:51,150
I felt like I was maybe up on the 
scorecards,

1157
00:55:51,151 --> 00:55:51,990
but I'm like,
fuck it,

1158
00:55:51,991 --> 00:55:54,270
I need to go out there.
And I started the round really,

1159
00:55:54,271 --> 00:55:57,860
really strong I think,
and then he woke up and you know,

1160
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,270
came on,
turned on is beast mode,

1161
00:56:00,271 --> 00:56:02,540
like he does at the end of a lot of 
fights and you know,

1162
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,190
had,
had led into some really heavy strikes.

1163
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,320
Um,
but it was,

1164
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:10,140
I mean we were just digging.
I don't even remember.

1165
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,030
Honestly,
I don't.

1166
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:16,130
I remember at certain points,
I guess the only thing that I could 

1167
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:21,380
compare it to was like being in the 
ocean and having waves crashing on you 

1168
00:56:21,691 --> 00:56:26,320
and you're just getting your head above 
water just to get enough breath and then

1169
00:56:26,321 --> 00:56:28,540
boom,
you're getting another one crashing down

1170
00:56:28,541 --> 00:56:33,541
upon you and you are out of breath.
You're fucking struggling for survival 

1171
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:40,080
and you know,
and you're just doing your best to 

1172
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:40,080
fucking,
you know,

1173
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,890
to,
to come up a moment like that in a fight

1174
00:56:41,891 --> 00:56:46,891
like that has got to be something that 
fuels you in a way that nothing else can

1175
00:56:47,891 --> 00:56:52,891
when you're in the gym.
Because you know that those moments can 

1176
00:56:52,891 --> 00:56:55,351
happen.
Like when you're thinking about slowing 

1177
00:56:55,351 --> 00:56:57,631
down and a strength and conditioning 
program or when you're doing rounds in 

1178
00:56:57,631 --> 00:56:58,840
the bag and you're thinking about 
slowing down that moments,

1179
00:56:58,841 --> 00:57:00,430
like thinking about that fight.

1180
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:02,770
I mean,
that has got to be.

1181
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:03,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

1182
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:08,040
That's something tangible you fucking 
grab onto when you're hitting those,

1183
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,480
those,
those points.

1184
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:10,780
You're hitting your,
your,

1185
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:16,020
your edge and you don't know if you can 
go any farther than that sort of thing 

1186
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:18,040
that can bring you through.
You know,

1187
00:57:18,041 --> 00:57:23,041
there's the debate in mma.
Like what is the most important aspect 

1188
00:57:23,041 --> 00:57:24,220
of training?
Is it strength and conditioning?

1189
00:57:24,221 --> 00:57:26,110
Is it skill training?
How do you,

1190
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:28,600
how do you quantify that when it comes 
to a fight camp?

1191
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:33,990
And uh,
one of the things that nickerson was 

1192
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:36,181
saying when I talked to him about it,
it's like he believes that one of 

1193
00:57:36,181 --> 00:57:37,870
fighter comes to him or when a fighter 
is preparing for a fight,

1194
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,720
they already have all these skills.
They already know how to fight.

1195
00:57:40,721 --> 00:57:44,950
They already know how to kickbox here.
And I already know Jujitsu when it comes

1196
00:57:44,951 --> 00:57:49,951
down to what a camp is,
he believes that the primary focus 

1197
00:57:49,961 --> 00:57:51,670
should be on physical preparation.

1198
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:56,880
The primary focus should be on getting 
your body to be able to perform at an 

1199
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,350
extremely high output for a long time or
recover quickly.

1200
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:04,620
And if you can get there that the 
benefits of that are greater than the 

1201
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:08,761
benefits of just consistently working on
skill training and drilling and all 

1202
00:58:08,761 --> 00:58:08,761
these other things.
Um,

1203
00:58:08,761 --> 00:58:12,500
I think there has to be a balance 
because you can be in phenomenal fucking

1204
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:17,520
shape,
ready to go five rounds and then step 

1205
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:17,520
out and get knocked the fuck out.
Yeah.

1206
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,650
So,
and,

1207
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:20,590
or you could,
you could freeze up.

1208
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:22,590
So I think the,
the,

1209
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,120
the,
the mental aspect of it,

1210
00:58:24,121 --> 00:58:27,610
the psychological aspect is super,
super important drill,

1211
00:58:27,611 --> 00:58:28,970
anything like that.
Do you,

1212
00:58:28,971 --> 00:58:33,971
do you have a mental coach or do you 
have a visualization drills or anything 

1213
00:58:33,971 --> 00:58:34,930
along those lines?
I visualize,

1214
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:36,160
I do,
but um,

1215
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,410
and I've done this quite a bit,
you know,

1216
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:43,440
I,
a coach I work with ricky lundell talks 

1217
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,320
about bringing it to the moment,
you know,

1218
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:46,360
it's,
it's about being a game day player.

1219
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:47,950
I love ricky by the way.
He's awesome.

1220
00:58:47,951 --> 00:58:52,951
Absolutely.
Great grappler a super smart guy and 

1221
00:58:52,951 --> 00:58:52,951
just cool as hell.
Yeah.

1222
00:58:52,951 --> 00:58:53,200
Yeah.
I just love that guy.

1223
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:57,010
Good all around dude for sure.
But I'm being a game day player,

1224
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,710
you know,
you get a lot of these guys in the gym,

1225
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:01,750
they're killers,
world beaters,

1226
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:04,900
but then you know,
the bell rings that are under the bright

1227
00:59:04,901 --> 00:59:09,901
lights and they just,
they wilt and the doubts and then come 

1228
00:59:09,901 --> 00:59:10,060
haunting home.
Yeah.

1229
00:59:10,061 --> 00:59:11,740
Well you get and then you get.
These other guys are like,

1230
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:12,670
really?
He's,

1231
00:59:12,671 --> 00:59:15,250
he's fighting in the UFC.
You're seeing training.

1232
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:16,090
You're like,
Oh man,

1233
00:59:16,091 --> 00:59:17,330
I don't know.
I don't know how well this,

1234
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:19,300
I don't know if I want to watch this.
He's a nice guy.

1235
00:59:19,301 --> 00:59:23,180
You're going to get worked.
And then he goes out there and you know,

1236
00:59:23,181 --> 00:59:24,110
and,
and does work.

1237
00:59:24,111 --> 00:59:27,740
It rises to the occasion and have 
accomplished as something that,

1238
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:30,590
you know,
maybe you maybe not even.

1239
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:33,540
He realized that he could do.
Yeah.

1240
00:59:33,541 --> 00:59:38,541
It's,
it's an interesting thing to try to 

1241
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:39,440
figure out where the balance,
where the focus should be.

1242
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:40,880
And I think it's different for 
everybody,

1243
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:42,260
man.
It's different for everybody.

1244
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:43,460
There's no,
there's no one answer.

1245
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:48,130
That's the thing about martial arts,
like I've heard some,

1246
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:51,200
I heard this guy talking about this one,
so it's not an art,

1247
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,690
you know,
that it's just people beating each other

1248
00:59:53,691 --> 00:59:54,410
up and I'm like,
wow,

1249
00:59:54,411 --> 00:59:58,610
that is such an ignorant thing to say 
because when you watch someone fight,

1250
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,670
you are watching art.
It's just violent.

1251
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:06,820
It's a violent art.
When I watch like your fight with Tiago 

1252
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:07,430
Elvis,
you can't tell me that was an art.

1253
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:12,550
That was an artistic performance,
like your interpretation of the 

1254
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:16,610
movements in the moment to step in and 
blast that elbow.

1255
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:17,630
That's,
that's,

1256
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:22,660
that's a beautiful thing.
I mean it's not beautiful to him or 

1257
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:23,120
anybody who cares about him or his 
facial structure or.

1258
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,100
Yes,
that's its beauty.

1259
01:00:25,101 --> 01:00:26,900
There's beauty in that.
There's beauty in that.

1260
01:00:26,901 --> 01:00:27,770
And,
and you know,

1261
01:00:27,771 --> 01:00:32,771
this,
but when he did that to Matt Hughes and 

1262
01:00:32,771 --> 01:00:32,771
when he hit Matt Hughes,
that flying knee,

1263
01:00:32,771 --> 01:00:34,140
there's beauty in martial arts there,
there is,

1264
01:00:34,141 --> 01:00:35,930
it's a well for,
for me,

1265
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,750
it,
it always has been a creative outlet.

1266
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:44,020
I can put together all these sequences 
and all these different things and in a 

1267
01:00:44,421 --> 01:00:49,010
way to solve a particular problem while 
something,

1268
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:51,500
somebody else is trying to do the same 
thing against me.

1269
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:55,040
And the margin for error is really 
fucking thin.

1270
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:56,230
You know,
if I,

1271
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:58,410
if I zig when I should have zagged 
kitchen,

1272
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:00,680
a shin upside my head and um,
you know,

1273
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:04,070
there's going to be bone exposed and um,
you know,

1274
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:06,100
that's why this is a great thing as 
well.

1275
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:07,610
That's why I'm amazed.
So fucking cool.

1276
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:09,500
It's so fucking cool to watch.

1277
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:13,880
But the,
the preparation for one night,

1278
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:19,180
like the idea that you're,
especially for a guy like you who came 

1279
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:23,291
off of a knee surgery,
you're out for a year and then you have 

1280
01:01:23,291 --> 01:01:24,600
to hold out for more than a year for the
geography.

1281
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:25,550
Right.
And how long was it?

1282
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:30,580
Probably a 16 months.
So you have all this time building up to

1283
01:01:34,221 --> 01:01:39,221
this one moment.
How difficult is it to just to just be 

1284
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:46,060
in the moment when that happens and not 
be overwhelmed by the fact that so much 

1285
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:51,911
of your future is riding on this.
You're not entirely set for life 

1286
01:01:51,911 --> 01:01:53,040
financially yet.
You know,

1287
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:55,640
there's all these different variables.
You have a wife,

1288
01:01:55,641 --> 01:01:58,700
you have a child,
you have a family of obligations,

1289
01:01:58,701 --> 01:02:03,701
you have all these things,
but yet here you are preparing for this 

1290
01:02:03,701 --> 01:02:06,290
one completely.
Just,

1291
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:12,050
it's like,
it just slips through your fingers this 

1292
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:14,411
moment.
This moment is just there that you 

1293
01:02:14,411 --> 01:02:14,420
cannot,
you can't hold down and you're,

1294
01:02:14,421 --> 01:02:19,421
you're sharing this moment with another 
trained killer and you're just locked 

1295
01:02:19,421 --> 01:02:20,010
into a cage and you

1296
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,120
future rides on your success.
Yeah.

1297
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,990
Um,
I like to say that,

1298
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:25,950
you know,
fight day,

1299
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:30,890
know that that night could be the best 
night of your life or the,

1300
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:33,210
or the worst and you don't know fucking 
which one.

1301
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:37,230
And there's an incredible mix of 
emotions.

1302
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:40,710
And I feel,
I feel happy.

1303
01:02:40,711 --> 01:02:42,390
I feel sad.
I feel fucking nervous.

1304
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:43,580
I feel,
um,

1305
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,040
uh,
you know,

1306
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:50,060
elated to be,
to be there and then fucking scared as 

1307
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:53,481
shit and I don't want to do this anymore
and I really just have to ride it out 

1308
01:02:53,481 --> 01:02:55,620
and be in,
in trust,

1309
01:02:55,621 --> 01:02:56,670
in my training,
trust,

1310
01:02:56,671 --> 01:02:58,860
in the preparation that I've done up to 
that point.

1311
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:04,130
Um,
because me and my mind and my emotions 

1312
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:06,231
do all sorts of things,
but I just have to know that I've done 

1313
01:03:06,231 --> 01:03:09,891
what I need to do in preparation for 
this fight that I'm going to be all 

1314
01:03:09,891 --> 01:03:13,491
right and that no matter what,
I know that I will never give anything 

1315
01:03:14,551 --> 01:03:17,190
less than 100 percent than my best.

1316
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:20,290
I will never give anything less than,
you know,

1317
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:24,150
what you saw in that fight.
I may get knocked out,

1318
01:03:24,850 --> 01:03:25,440
but,
or,

1319
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:25,910
or,
you know,

1320
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:27,510
it may,
may be an early night for me.

1321
01:03:27,511 --> 01:03:30,420
It may be a terrible night,
but that's out of my control.

1322
01:03:30,421 --> 01:03:34,020
I,
I gave everything that I could to each,

1323
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:36,060
each round,
each training session,

1324
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,470
uh,
each,

1325
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,480
each minute of,
of,

1326
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:41,640
of the training camps.
So that,

1327
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:42,990
um,
when I,

1328
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:48,020
when I step out there,
I've done everything in my control to 

1329
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:50,280
fucking win this fight and to compete to
the best of my ability.

1330
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:55,540
Um,
there's also the things that are out of 

1331
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:55,540
your control.
You can't worry about that shit.

1332
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,150
Injuries like injuries,
Tyron Woodley,

1333
01:03:57,151 --> 01:03:59,100
fight or kitchen,
that one that you don't see.

1334
01:03:59,160 --> 01:03:59,720
Yeah.
No.

1335
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:00,600
And,
and you know,

1336
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:02,100
shit happens,
but that's Kinda the,

1337
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,840
that's the,
uh,

1338
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:10,100
that's the thrill of it.
Does that make the highlights sweeter 

1339
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,120
knowing that those,
those,

1340
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:18,040
you know,
the bad moments are out there that 

1341
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:18,040
they're possible?
Oh yeah,

1342
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:18,040
definitely.
I,

1343
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:22,520
it's like I said,
we're walking on a razor's razor's edge 

1344
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:23,130
on this thing.
I mean,

1345
01:04:23,131 --> 01:04:25,140
it could,
it could be a phenomenal night.

1346
01:04:25,141 --> 01:04:26,460
It could be terrible night,
man.

1347
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:27,420
Fuck,
I don't know.

1348
01:04:27,421 --> 01:04:31,590
Nobody's died in MMA at this point,
but not in the UFC and the UFC,

1349
01:04:31,591 --> 01:04:34,260
but it shit could happen.
This is a tough thing.

1350
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,510
What are your,
what's your feelings on weight cutting?

1351
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:42,240
Like if you,
if you could be assured that

1352
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:44,520
way.
Cutting.

1353
01:04:44,521 --> 01:04:49,521
We'd be out of the picture.
Like let's just throw all the weight 

1354
01:04:49,521 --> 01:04:49,521
classes out and then let's just say 
like,

1355
01:04:49,521 --> 01:04:50,820
what are you,
what do you walk around like one 85,

1356
01:04:50,821 --> 01:04:55,821
one 90,
something like that between [inaudible] 

1357
01:04:55,821 --> 01:04:58,011
91 95.
If you could be assured that that is 

1358
01:04:58,011 --> 01:05:01,581
just,
that's what your opponent's going away 

1359
01:05:01,581 --> 01:05:01,581
and that's what you're going to wait.
You don't have to cut any weight,

1360
01:05:01,581 --> 01:05:03,840
would wouldn't you think that that would
be a better way to compete,

1361
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:06,750
to just completely eliminate that from 
the equation.

1362
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:11,930
Just find out whatever is your natural 
healthy weight and competed that instead

1363
01:05:12,151 --> 01:05:17,151
of this insane thing that everyone's 
doing where they're dehydrating 

1364
01:05:17,151 --> 01:05:19,000
themselves a massive percentage of your 
body weight,

1365
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:21,470
sometimes as much as 10 percent of your 
body weight,

1366
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:25,750
which is getting sucked away in water to
the point where you could literally only

1367
01:05:25,751 --> 01:05:28,900
exist in that state for a short period 
of time.

1368
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:29,810
Couple of hours.
Yeah.

1369
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:35,070
That's fucking bananas that that's a 
part of cage fighting that one day.

1370
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:40,740
To me,
I feel like the athletic commissions are

1371
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:46,771
sleeping on a potential time bomb.
They're just ignoring that this is a 

1372
01:05:46,961 --> 01:05:51,961
huge issue.
While they're concentrating on steroids 

1373
01:05:51,961 --> 01:05:52,810
and epo and all these other things which
are real issues,

1374
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,330
those things are unquestionably real 
issues,

1375
01:05:55,750 --> 01:06:00,750
but just as big of an issue is massive 
dehydration 24 hours before a cage 

1376
01:06:01,331 --> 01:06:06,331
fight,
especially now that they've eliminated 

1377
01:06:06,331 --> 01:06:09,930
the ivy rehydration methods and the fact
that we know now there's medical science

1378
01:06:12,641 --> 01:06:17,641
has proven that the brain does not 
rehydrate as fast as the rest of the 

1379
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:18,560
tissue.
It takes longer.

1380
01:06:18,561 --> 01:06:23,230
It takes as much as 70 hours or 70 hours
too,

1381
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:25,000
which is fucking crazy.
Or

1382
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,090
the yeah.
To rehydrate your brain.

1383
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:30,280
Um,
yeah.

1384
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:35,940
I,
I think it'd be interesting to see 

1385
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:38,881
different proposals.
I know that one fc is doing something 

1386
01:06:38,881 --> 01:06:39,040
well,
they've eliminated it there.

1387
01:06:39,041 --> 01:06:39,480
They,
yeah.

1388
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:41,890
What are they gonna check your hydration
levels.

1389
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,570
They're going to eliminate weight 
cutting.

1390
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:48,720
Yeah.
Well I know that they're doing the 

1391
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,140
hydration levels on like a collegiate 
and high school wrestling,

1392
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:51,200
um,
you know,

1393
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:54,250
a level.
And I still,

1394
01:06:54,251 --> 01:06:56,200
I still know guys that are trying to 
game that system.

1395
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,510
Yeah.
We'll let him try to game that system.

1396
01:06:58,511 --> 01:07:01,570
Yeah.
But if you can eliminate that and tasked

1397
01:07:01,571 --> 01:07:04,570
hydration levels and like,
imagine like a guy like Johnny Hendricks

1398
01:07:04,571 --> 01:07:09,571
who never made it to the fight with 
Tyron Woodley because the weight 

1399
01:07:09,571 --> 01:07:12,181
cutting,
imagine them getting to a point where 

1400
01:07:12,181 --> 01:07:12,181
they check them.
They go,

1401
01:07:12,181 --> 01:07:12,340
hey man,
you're fucking dehydrated.

1402
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,460
You can't fight.
Yeah.

1403
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:15,890
Like you,
you didn't make weight like you,

1404
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,920
you're not where you're supposed to be.

1405
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:23,780
Yeah.
I'm on the side of health for fighters 

1406
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:26,470
and these guys taking care of 
themselves.

1407
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:28,570
You know,
we're doing this for a very brief period

1408
01:07:28,571 --> 01:07:33,571
of time in our lives and you know,
the repercussions longterm from a lot 

1409
01:07:33,571 --> 01:07:37,861
of.
The lot of the different stuff involve 

1410
01:07:37,861 --> 01:07:37,861
including weight cutting.
Uh,

1411
01:07:37,861 --> 01:07:42,520
you know,
this is gonna have longterm 

1412
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:42,520
ramifications.
So for internal organs,

1413
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:43,480
specifically kidneys,
right?

1414
01:07:43,481 --> 01:07:47,060
Yeah.
And I think it ages you man,

1415
01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:52,390
it,
especially if you're not doing it 

1416
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:54,211
correctly,
especially if you're not living a 

1417
01:07:54,211 --> 01:07:54,211
healthy lifestyle year round,
all of a sudden,

1418
01:07:54,211 --> 01:07:58,020
boom,
I'm going to change the way that I eat 

1419
01:07:58,020 --> 01:07:59,080
so drastically that my body's go freak 
the fuck out.

1420
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:02,220
Which you see a lot of these guys and 
then they don't make it to the,

1421
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:07,260
they don't make it to the way because 
their system isn't used to eating like 

1422
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:07,260
this.
Most of you know,

1423
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:10,420
eating a bunch of bullshit and now all 
of a sudden eating Greens,

1424
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:15,540
which is good for you,
but your body's still going to have 

1425
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:15,540
this,
this,

1426
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:15,540
this reaction to it.

1427
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:16,430
Yeah.
And when you're not used to it.

1428
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:17,990
Uh,
so yeah,

1429
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:23,050
I would,
I would definitely like to see some 

1430
01:08:23,050 --> 01:08:23,050
change.
Um,

1431
01:08:23,050 --> 01:08:23,210
you know,
if it benefits the health of fighters,

1432
01:08:23,211 --> 01:08:28,211
I'm all for it.
I don't think it could possibly not 

1433
01:08:28,211 --> 01:08:30,761
benefit them.
I think that would be the biggest thing 

1434
01:08:30,761 --> 01:08:31,190
that we could do.
Even more so than I think what the,

1435
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:36,270
what Jeff Novitsky and the UFC is trying
to do with eliminating performance 

1436
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:38,030
enhancing drugs is awesome.
I love the fact that catching people.

1437
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:40,670
I can't believe that they caught ul.
Romero.

1438
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,040
Who would've thought that that guy was 
taking steroids.

1439
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:46,170
That's crazy.
Who would have thought that?

1440
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,110
That's amazing.
Couple of those guys,

1441
01:08:48,111 --> 01:08:49,790
man.
I would've never believed it.

1442
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:54,050
Him or Hector Lombard was another one 
who saw that common.

1443
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,600
That's nuts.
Vito Belfort,

1444
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:58,820
are you kidding me?
Nuts.

1445
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,290
Cyborg.
Really?

1446
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:02,120
Wow.
Crazy.

1447
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:02,960
Yeah.
Yeah.

1448
01:09:02,961 --> 01:09:03,890
I think that,
uh,

1449
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,450
it's,
it's awesome because,

1450
01:09:05,451 --> 01:09:08,590
um,
I mean we're,

1451
01:09:08,690 --> 01:09:13,690
we're going to come to a point in time 
in the real near future where it's 

1452
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:13,690
impossible.

1453
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:13,690
Cheat.
I mean,

1454
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:18,371
they're pretty close to it now.
They're pretty close to it now where 

1455
01:09:18,371 --> 01:09:19,130
they are so good at catching people,
but they're,

1456
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:21,770
they're also saving urine,
which I think is fascinating.

1457
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:26,830
See Urine and blood for eight years,
so to test in case they don't have a 

1458
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:30,641
test that detects whatever it is you're 
testing at this point where we can test 

1459
01:09:30,641 --> 01:09:31,800
you down the down the way.
Exactly.

1460
01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:35,330
And you can come up,
which is cool.

1461
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:38,600
They're super close to being able to 
catch you doing anything now.

1462
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:42,500
But what they're doing is they're coming
up with all these little designer things

1463
01:09:42,501 --> 01:09:47,501
and peptides and that's what you'll all 
were got caught for some designer 

1464
01:09:47,501 --> 01:09:50,981
peptide which artificially increases 
your body's own production of 

1465
01:09:50,981 --> 01:09:52,010
testosterone,
you know?

1466
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:57,070
So they're doing all this sneaky weird 
shit that used to be totally 

1467
01:09:57,070 --> 01:09:58,100
undetectable,
you know,

1468
01:09:58,101 --> 01:09:59,720
five,
six years ago or what have you.

1469
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:00,530
Yeah.
Well at that,

1470
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,210
I think that's what they'd been doing 
for a long time.

1471
01:10:02,211 --> 01:10:03,010
Correct.
Like they,

1472
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:08,020
it's been like an arms race between the 
dopers and antidote with.

1473
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:14,150
That's what I understand with the Lance 
Armstrong who was like a clear thing,

1474
01:10:14,151 --> 01:10:19,151
man.
They were like some super sophisticated 

1475
01:10:19,151 --> 01:10:22,010
fucking programs to beat these tests.
Yeah.

1476
01:10:22,011 --> 01:10:27,011
And with Lance Armstrong,
one of the interesting things was 

1477
01:10:27,011 --> 01:10:31,040
everybody was dirty.
I mean it's not like mma where you have,

1478
01:10:31,070 --> 01:10:33,950
there's a few guys that uh,
Novitsky,

1479
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:37,680
I think he calls it the smell test or 
the look test while you look at them and

1480
01:10:37,681 --> 01:10:40,160
you go,
who the fuck's going on over there?

1481
01:10:40,161 --> 01:10:41,000
Right.
You know.

1482
01:10:41,330 --> 01:10:45,850
But with Armstrong,
like none of those guys looked like your

1483
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:50,970
marrow.
They were just little skinny guys on 

1484
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:50,970
bikes.
It's the nature of the sport.

1485
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:55,120
And I think what they were probably what
they were taking is different than what 

1486
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:55,120
fucking,
you know,

1487
01:10:55,610 --> 01:10:57,700
big muscled up a prize.

1488
01:10:57,710 --> 01:10:58,670
Fighters are taking.
Well,

1489
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:03,671
another important distinction about 
these bands and about the banning of Ivy

1490
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:11,230
Rehydration is now you can't blood dope 
because they used to be able to blood 

1491
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:11,750
dope.
He used to be able to pretty,

1492
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:16,110
pretty easy to just take your blood out 
and then reinserted into your body.

1493
01:11:16,111 --> 01:11:18,870
You have more blood and you get the same
sort of benefits that you would get with

1494
01:11:18,871 --> 01:11:23,871
epo.
So you can't do that anymore because 

1495
01:11:23,871 --> 01:11:23,871
they'll,
they'll be able to detect.

1496
01:11:23,871 --> 01:11:28,020
They can actually detect plastics in the
blood that come from the bags and from 

1497
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:29,670
the tubes.
It's fucking nuts.

1498
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:30,530
It's wild.
Yeah,

1499
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:33,750
it's nuts.
It's fucking crazy what they can do.

1500
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,550
I've heard,
I've heard though,

1501
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,240
like in,
you know,

1502
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:42,690
we're talking about the arms race that 
people can use a glass syringe class and

1503
01:11:44,671 --> 01:11:47,090
then um,
the van,

1504
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:50,790
like a sterilized veins from animals as 
their,

1505
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:51,840
as their tubing.

1506
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:52,890
That's,
that's whatever.

1507
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:55,680
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1508
01:11:55,681 --> 01:11:57,000
That's so crazy.
Yeah.

1509
01:11:57,060 --> 01:12:00,840
Like sausage casing and shit.
Oh my God.

1510
01:12:00,841 --> 01:12:04,120
That's fucking.
Now they're going to check for big veins

1511
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:08,760
down the rabbit hole with all that 
stuff.

1512
01:12:08,761 --> 01:12:09,820
That's.
Well,

1513
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:14,840
Novitsky was telling me that they've now
figured out a way to develop 

1514
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:18,891
testosterone from animals and it's a 
semi theoretical at this point where 

1515
01:12:19,091 --> 01:12:24,091
they don't,
they haven't caught anybody who's done 

1516
01:12:24,091 --> 01:12:25,971
it yet,
and then maybe one of the reasons why 

1517
01:12:25,971 --> 01:12:25,971
they're,
you know,

1518
01:12:25,971 --> 01:12:25,971
they're holding onto this blood for 
eight years,

1519
01:12:25,971 --> 01:12:29,040
but he said they've figured out a way 
because right now I don't understand the

1520
01:12:29,041 --> 01:12:34,041
process,
but right now the way they develop 

1521
01:12:34,041 --> 01:12:34,170
artificial testosterone is through wild 
yams.

1522
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:38,100
They use Mexican yams.
I fucking don't understand it,

1523
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:42,720
but somehow through yams they can 
develop testosterone.

1524
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,390
Those are manly,
manly Yam.

1525
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:48,930
I've always said again what I am.

1526
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:52,020
That's why pop pop,
I knew he was ahead of the time.

1527
01:12:52,021 --> 01:12:57,021
They make me feel manly.
So they've figured out a way through 

1528
01:12:57,021 --> 01:13:00,621
these carbon isotope tests to detect 
that the testosterone in your body was 

1529
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:04,410
nonindigenous,
that it was exogenous.

1530
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:06,540
It's somehow or another from something 
else,

1531
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:10,200
but they won't be able to do this right 
now,

1532
01:13:10,201 --> 01:13:15,201
at least with animal testosterone,
which is so fucking bizarre.

1533
01:13:16,110 --> 01:13:20,820
It will always be a race between the 
cheaters and those who control those.

1534
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:26,350
Uh,
with the French Tour de France secretly 

1535
01:13:26,350 --> 01:13:30,470
symbolism,
a biking and a back in the early 20th 

1536
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:33,090
century there were doing it already.
And then today,

1537
01:13:33,091 --> 01:13:38,091
every Sunday there is some competition 
somewhere like a local short distance 

1538
01:13:38,091 --> 01:13:38,630
drafting and those,
you know,

1539
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:41,310
Sunday athletes and they dope.
Yeah.

1540
01:13:41,311 --> 01:13:46,311
They're saying that like they check 
executives that want to like show off 

1541
01:13:46,311 --> 01:13:50,270
our taking epo and entering in 
triathlons and winning them can put that

1542
01:13:50,401 --> 01:13:53,220
on their resume.
May Jack to the tits on EPO,

1543
01:13:53,221 --> 01:13:55,290
which is really fucking dangerous 
apparently.

1544
01:13:55,550 --> 01:14:00,550
I don't understand he epo,
but the way it's been described to me 

1545
01:14:00,550 --> 01:14:02,760
was that when you have so much extra 
blood in your system,

1546
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:08,120
there's a high risk of stroke and that 
you have to mitigate the amount of EPO 

1547
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:11,990
and the amount of blood in your system 
by constantly exercising.

1548
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:15,130
Like you have to exercise.
You have to drink water and exercise.

1549
01:14:15,131 --> 01:14:18,100
Otherwise your blood gets too thick.
As we talk,

1550
01:14:18,101 --> 01:14:22,480
millions of people are doing crazy 
things in their day to day life that are

1551
01:14:22,481 --> 01:14:26,260
going to mess up with their brain,
mess up with their whole physiology,

1552
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:29,950
hormonal balance and stuff like that,
and they're not getting paid to do it.

1553
01:14:29,951 --> 01:14:33,550
They just do it out of whatever 
ignorance or laziness or a.

1554
01:14:33,551 --> 01:14:36,940
So why wouldn't these professional 
athletes of some of them,

1555
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,280
especially in combat sports.
Yeah,

1556
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:41,010
yeah.
I mean there's one thing running.

1557
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:46,020
Winning a bike race is one thing,
but not getting kicked in the head or 

1558
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:49,441
being able to kick the guy in the head 
because you have that extra juice of 

1559
01:14:49,441 --> 01:14:50,290
energy.
You know when you're tired and you're in

1560
01:14:50,291 --> 01:14:55,291
that fifth round,
but you come out because you're on epo 

1561
01:14:55,291 --> 01:14:58,560
and you're fucking dominick Cruz,
step in and throw in high kicks and the 

1562
01:14:58,560 --> 01:14:58,930
other dude is gasping for air.

1563
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:01,540
That's,
that's where it becomes a huge issue.

1564
01:15:01,541 --> 01:15:03,160
Absolutely.
I mean we're talking,

1565
01:15:03,370 --> 01:15:05,140
you know,
potentially light.

1566
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:06,490
Sure.
Well,

1567
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:11,650
the way I describe MMA is it's high 
level problem solving with dire physical

1568
01:15:11,651 --> 01:15:14,360
consequences and that's.
And we've seen it,

1569
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:17,320
we've all seen guys get flatlined.
We've all seen people,

1570
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,300
I mean,
you've done it to a bunch of guys inside

1571
01:15:19,301 --> 01:15:21,570
the octagon and it could have been you,
you know,

1572
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:26,610
I mean,
it's a fucking nutty sport and in this 

1573
01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:29,911
sport the doping has just a much higher 
level of consequences or ramifications,

1574
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:33,060
ramifications,
right word.

1575
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:37,090
What's interesting to me though,
I'm absolutely anti-doping,

1576
01:15:37,150 --> 01:15:42,150
but I'm pro the science involved in it 
because what we're experiencing right 

1577
01:15:43,031 --> 01:15:48,031
now,
what I believe is that we are in a 

1578
01:15:48,031 --> 01:15:50,281
period of time in human history where 
our understanding of the scientific 

1579
01:15:50,281 --> 01:15:55,231
understanding of the body and its 
mechanisms and all of the things that 

1580
01:15:55,231 --> 01:15:58,711
they can do to it is being sort of 
deciphered and tweaked and poked by all 

1581
01:15:59,561 --> 01:16:01,060
these various scientists.

1582
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:04,960
Although I believe that should be 
outside of competitive athletics.

1583
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:07,990
We're going to get to a point in who 
knows,

1584
01:16:07,991 --> 01:16:08,680
10,
20,

1585
01:16:08,681 --> 01:16:12,340
30 years where they're going to be able 
to genetically reengineer human beings.

1586
01:16:12,790 --> 01:16:14,590
And this is all going to be out the 
window.

1587
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:19,480
I think we're kind of experiencing the 
last years of natural competition,

1588
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:22,300
gene doping stuff.
It's going to happen.

1589
01:16:22,301 --> 01:16:25,360
I mean,
they have this new thing that they've,

1590
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:26,010
uh,
they,

1591
01:16:26,011 --> 01:16:31,011
they've figured out how to do or they,
because of this really interesting 

1592
01:16:32,410 --> 01:16:37,410
science,
it's called Crispr is what they've 

1593
01:16:37,410 --> 01:16:37,960
developed and there's,
I'll butcher it if I try to give you the

1594
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:42,961
scientific definition of it,
but they can literally add genes and,

1595
01:16:43,311 --> 01:16:48,010
and manipulate genes and they're doing 
so in small animals and you know,

1596
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,790
small,
multicellular organisms and they're,

1597
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:55,900
they're getting it to a point where they
really understand it and they're saying 

1598
01:16:55,900 --> 01:17:00,331
that in China they're starting to do 
this with human beings and they're 

1599
01:17:00,331 --> 01:17:01,720
starting to fuck with it and test it and
you know,

1600
01:17:01,721 --> 01:17:06,721
you might see some Chinese Wolverine in 
the next 20 years and you'll know that 

1601
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:10,820
that kid is the product of these Chinese
experiments.

1602
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:11,810
You know,
I mean,

1603
01:17:11,811 --> 01:17:15,230
that's what they used to call corella 
these to call Corella and the experiment

1604
01:17:15,650 --> 01:17:17,720
because if you've ever seen Carolyn's 
family,

1605
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:20,600
his mother and father like five foot 
six,

1606
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:25,930
they're like these tiny people.
And Carolyn was this fucking monster of 

1607
01:17:26,961 --> 01:17:28,400
a wrestler.
You know,

1608
01:17:28,401 --> 01:17:29,570
if you,
do you know who we're talking about?

1609
01:17:29,571 --> 01:17:32,830
Alexander Karelin,
undefeated wrestler.

1610
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,970
I mean,
he lost one time to rule on gardener,

1611
01:17:34,971 --> 01:17:37,280
but the only reason we lost is they 
changed a rule.

1612
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:39,230
They changed the rule that this is 
Greco,

1613
01:17:39,231 --> 01:17:42,110
so crazy.
Whereas if you release your grip,

1614
01:17:42,111 --> 01:17:43,640
if someone gets you to release your 
grip,

1615
01:17:44,010 --> 01:17:47,630
it's a point which is insane and that's 
how gardener beat him.

1616
01:17:47,631 --> 01:17:52,631
Like he couldn't do anything to him,
but he got corella and towards the end 

1617
01:17:52,631 --> 01:17:52,750
of his career,
you know what I mean?

1618
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:55,010
He'd been wrestled forever,
but he would.

1619
01:17:55,220 --> 01:18:00,220
He was so scary that guys would try to 
flatten out to keep from getting thrown 

1620
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:04,691
by him because he was so strong that he 
would take these men 280 pound man and 

1621
01:18:04,691 --> 01:18:07,160
he would just go under them while their 
belly down,

1622
01:18:07,161 --> 01:18:09,530
flattened out on the mat,
just praying.

1623
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:14,530
They don't get taken for a ride and he 
would lift them up and throw them 

1624
01:18:14,541 --> 01:18:16,940
through the air with all his weight and 
their way.

1625
01:18:17,210 --> 01:18:18,410
Boom.
Coming down on them.

1626
01:18:18,411 --> 01:18:23,411
So he's essentially knocking them the 
fuck out with the mat where everybody 

1627
01:18:23,411 --> 01:18:26,090
else was wrestling.
He was wrestling as well,

1628
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:28,090
but he was also hitting you with the 
world,

1629
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:32,120
you know,
it was crazy and no one knows how he got

1630
01:18:32,121 --> 01:18:35,360
so fucking big in history of sports.
There are always these,

1631
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:39,550
these freak of nature,
these complete exceptional athlete in,

1632
01:18:39,630 --> 01:18:44,630
in a given,
in a given sport with what you say and 

1633
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:44,940
the manipulations that are going to be 
able to do on,

1634
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:50,420
on physiology may be using 
nanotechnologies or indeed a genetic 

1635
01:18:51,081 --> 01:18:55,730
modifications.
They might be able to replicate to clone

1636
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,300
those,
those freaks of,

1637
01:18:58,360 --> 01:18:59,240
of science.
Oh,

1638
01:18:59,241 --> 01:19:03,040
they're going to work.
It doesn't happen in our lifetimes.

1639
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:04,750
It will happen in our children's 
lifetimes.

1640
01:19:04,770 --> 01:19:07,430
It's going to happen.
Science doesn't stop.

1641
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:10,610
I mean it's.
If you go just go back 40,

1642
01:19:10,611 --> 01:19:12,650
50 years.
What they were able to do,

1643
01:19:12,651 --> 01:19:14,180
if you had a knee surgery,
you know,

1644
01:19:14,181 --> 01:19:15,770
like you're talking about your knee 
graft,

1645
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:18,710
they were fucked.
You're fucked.

1646
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:20,150
You're crippled.
Bumpkiny.

1647
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:21,590
Yeah.
That's just 50 years ago.

1648
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:26,600
That's.
That's inside of a living person's 

1649
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:26,600
lifetime.
20,

1650
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:30,220
25 years ago or less.
They weren't able to do this one that I 

1651
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:30,220
had successful.
Yes.

1652
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:34,720
My friend Steve Graham was on the US ski
team and he's had some fucking insane 

1653
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:35,400
number of surgeries.
I,

1654
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:38,960
I want to say he's around 18 knee 
surgeries.

1655
01:19:39,090 --> 01:19:40,860
He said he has his knees,
kept like,

1656
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:41,800
I'll,
I'll show you this real.

1657
01:19:41,801 --> 01:19:45,020
You fucking freaked out.
He has his knees resurfaced.

1658
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:47,490
The tops of his knees are,
um,

1659
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:50,990
it's all steel.
It's fucking bizarre,

1660
01:19:50,991 --> 01:19:52,030
man.
It's so,

1661
01:19:52,031 --> 01:19:56,090
it's so freaky to look at.
But he came around,

1662
01:19:56,170 --> 01:20:01,170
uh,
when they were doing all these 

1663
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:01,170
experimental surgeries,
they just,

1664
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:02,060
they just couldn't.
They didn't know how to do it.

1665
01:20:02,061 --> 01:20:05,410
They just were taking all these risks.
And here it is right here.

1666
01:20:05,411 --> 01:20:08,100
I'm gonna show you this.
This is fucking freaky.

1667
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:12,930
That's the surface of the inside of his 
knee.

1668
01:20:13,230 --> 01:20:18,230
So he has no more cartilage and all the 
meniscus has gone as well.

1669
01:20:18,361 --> 01:20:20,190
So if you see that white thing down 
there,

1670
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:25,310
that's artificial meniscus,
that's like a pad that they put in 

1671
01:20:25,310 --> 01:20:29,931
place.
So they put this artificial paths in 

1672
01:20:29,931 --> 01:20:31,080
place.
Then they have the tops of the knee,

1673
01:20:31,081 --> 01:20:36,081
the top of the femur and that glides on 
the Plastic Lusaka abstract painting.

1674
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:40,110
It's fucking chaos.
Like dinner?

1675
01:20:40,190 --> 01:20:43,200
Yeah.
I told him to send me this after you get

1676
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:46,350
your latest operation because he's had 
so many operations.

1677
01:20:46,351 --> 01:20:49,200
He was so true down to the wire that 
this is,

1678
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:53,790
this is the latest sort of fix.
That's wild man.

1679
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:58,820
It's fucking crazy.
And she's had multiple acl surgeries on 

1680
01:20:58,921 --> 01:21:00,740
both legs,
MCL.

1681
01:21:00,850 --> 01:21:04,380
It's just the whole deal.
Meniscus scopes and this.

1682
01:21:04,381 --> 01:21:09,381
And that is nothing left.
They predicted that so many years ago 

1683
01:21:09,381 --> 01:21:09,381
when I was a kid.

1684
01:21:09,381 --> 01:21:10,800
Uh,
Steve Austin,

1685
01:21:10,830 --> 01:21:12,150
whatever the name was,
man,

1686
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:16,050
it was fascinating by them.
Yeah,

1687
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:17,370
we're,
we're close to that.

1688
01:21:17,371 --> 01:21:21,210
I mean they're putting artificial hips 
in people and having them being more,

1689
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:23,710
no more durable than the natural hips.
Yep.

1690
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:26,460
They're so using a exoskeletons.
Yes.

1691
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:31,970
Especially in Japan.
They're really big on all these 

1692
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:31,970
robotics.
I got it.

1693
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:35,210
Got An exoskeleton finding beautiful,
uh,

1694
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:40,250
for people who really need it.
You had a very serious accident and 

1695
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:43,890
there's nothing can do,
but it's now your responsibility or you 

1696
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:45,090
come back from war and need that,
that kind of assistance.

1697
01:21:45,091 --> 01:21:47,010
In that case,
I believe it's beautiful.

1698
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:48,870
Yes.
But my,

1699
01:21:48,890 --> 01:21:53,890
my concern is that these kinds of new 
technology is going to be vulnerable to 

1700
01:21:53,890 --> 01:21:56,460
millions of people who basically don't 
give a crap about their body.

1701
01:21:56,550 --> 01:22:01,550
Their body has become completely alien 
to themselves and the neglect it and let

1702
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:03,810
it deteriorate.

1703
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:07,500
You could think about it that way or you
could say,

1704
01:22:07,530 --> 01:22:09,600
you know what man?
It's just technology.

1705
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,240
It's.
It can be used or abused.

1706
01:22:12,241 --> 01:22:15,150
I mean like cars.
I mean cars can be used to get places or

1707
01:22:15,151 --> 01:22:17,790
you could be a fat fuck and they just 
will you over to your car.

1708
01:22:17,791 --> 01:22:20,640
You lose your way into the car and they 
push you in and shut the door.

1709
01:22:20,641 --> 01:22:23,370
Then the car drives you around because 
it's too fucking lazy.

1710
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:25,440
The balance in there.
I think in our society,

1711
01:22:25,930 --> 01:22:30,930
we always go too far.
That exoskeleton for your body becomes 

1712
01:22:31,171 --> 01:22:34,970
what the shoe is to your foot.
And I think that your,

1713
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:35,680
your,
that,

1714
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:37,290
your,
your,

1715
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:42,000
your foot is going to atrophy.
Your body's going to atrophy because you

1716
01:22:42,001 --> 01:22:44,520
have.
Your foot has this artificial art.

1717
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,500
But from birth,
like in wally,

1718
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:50,010
you know,
I love that move you.

1719
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,100
And the thing is that,
yeah,

1720
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:54,750
it's freedom,
it's inevitable freedom.

1721
01:22:54,751 --> 01:22:57,030
You do whatever you want to completely 
agree with that.

1722
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:00,480
But ultimately it becomes the norm.
It becomes something that's not shocking

1723
01:23:00,481 --> 01:23:03,790
anymore in the wally world,
uh,

1724
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:08,590
the movie in the end,
not being able to even stand,

1725
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:11,230
let alone to walk.
Isn't that shocking?

1726
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:12,130
It's,
it's the norm.

1727
01:23:12,131 --> 01:23:16,320
It's just something normal.
My grandma was able to walk a little,

1728
01:23:16,321 --> 01:23:17,600
a few steps.
Oh Wow.

1729
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:21,100
She was extremely fit.
Know that we ultimately,

1730
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:26,130
through generations we change the norm.
And so bear all won't be.

1731
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:29,170
We won't be there.
Yeah.

1732
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:34,560
But somewhat.
I like to know where we're going in a 

1733
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:34,790
good direction,
how the direction not to.

1734
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:36,730
I don't know.
I don't know if it is,

1735
01:23:37,150 --> 01:23:39,880
it's definitely crazy.
I don't know if it is a bad direction,

1736
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:45,090
but if we went back to a single celled 
organism and I go look at these posters 

1737
01:23:45,090 --> 01:23:45,960
with their multiple cells back when I 
was a fucking kid,

1738
01:23:45,961 --> 01:23:47,800
you had to have one cell or happy.

1739
01:23:47,830 --> 01:23:50,800
So I don't think,
I don't think it's good or bad.

1740
01:23:50,801 --> 01:23:53,170
I think it's how,
how it's applied.

1741
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:53,980
Yes.
You know,

1742
01:23:53,981 --> 01:23:55,600
and,
and is it beneficial,

1743
01:23:55,601 --> 01:23:59,260
is it right?
Is it detrimental and what,

1744
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:04,060
what is the implication on a societal 
level on like an overall thing?

1745
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:06,740
We can look at tech technology,
you know,

1746
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:10,720
the technology in general in,
in that respect.

1747
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,210
Um,
I like to see that as a,

1748
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:14,680
as a,
an,

1749
01:24:15,190 --> 01:24:20,190
as options,
as additional benefits to our current 

1750
01:24:20,190 --> 01:24:23,910
society.
And culture means that let's imagine 

1751
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:25,390
topia like a society where every 
individual would be,

1752
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:28,840
would consider their own health and 
movement ability,

1753
01:24:28,841 --> 01:24:33,130
eyes somewhat personal,
biological duty.

1754
01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:35,860
So there would really make sure that 
they stay strong.

1755
01:24:35,890 --> 01:24:37,780
They stay healthy,
they can move,

1756
01:24:38,190 --> 01:24:39,820
they're there,
they're in shape,

1757
01:24:39,821 --> 01:24:42,550
they're sharp physically and mentally 
and on top of that,

1758
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:47,580
whenever needed,
they would punctually and wisely use 

1759
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:47,580
those technologies.

1760
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:50,590
Then that will be an enhanced lifestyle 
and society.

1761
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:52,910
But when you have people,
it,

1762
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:57,920
it's just there to support people who 
have voluntarily disempowered and 

1763
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,010
themselves degenerate it themselves.
I,

1764
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:05,100
I don't,
I don't like the direction that would 

1765
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:07,181
be.
Are we basing that on the current 

1766
01:25:07,181 --> 01:25:07,210
paradigm though?
If we keep moving in the same direction,

1767
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:12,270
it's entirely possible that you're not 
going to need to be in shape or get in 

1768
01:25:12,431 --> 01:25:14,410
shape.
You're just gonna be in shape.

1769
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:17,080
You're going to have something that 
they've invented,

1770
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:19,900
whether it's some sort of a 
biotechnology or what have you,

1771
01:25:19,901 --> 01:25:22,360
where you never get out of shape.
You're always physically fit.

1772
01:25:22,361 --> 01:25:24,850
Your body regenerates tissue.
If you lose an arm,

1773
01:25:24,851 --> 01:25:26,140
it grows back.
No,

1774
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:28,180
it doesn't mean because here's the 
problem.

1775
01:25:28,181 --> 01:25:32,440
You won't be the master of a technology.
Somebody else will the same way.

1776
01:25:32,590 --> 01:25:37,570
It's like if you ever stop growing their
food,

1777
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:43,440
so when you're hungry,
you need that food to be delivered to 

1778
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:43,870
you to be produced for you.

1779
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:48,340
If at some point the production of food 
is in the hands of very little,

1780
01:25:48,670 --> 01:25:51,070
very few people,
there is no freedom anymore.

1781
01:25:51,071 --> 01:25:52,360
Okay,
so you said.

1782
01:25:52,361 --> 01:25:54,140
Yeah,
but it allows you to be always strong,

1783
01:25:54,170 --> 01:25:55,420
always fit,
always held the.

1784
01:25:55,421 --> 01:26:00,421
Yeah,
but the technology is in the hands of 

1785
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:00,421
the few people and when they want a 
ticket back.

1786
01:26:01,510 --> 01:26:06,510
That sounds like some Illuminati type,
but it's.

1787
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:07,810
It's,
it's,

1788
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:12,910
it's,
it's that you don't have to go into a 

1789
01:26:12,910 --> 01:26:12,910
conspiracy theory to think about,
do you,

1790
01:26:12,910 --> 01:26:17,890
are you in control?
Is it something that you can fix 

1791
01:26:17,890 --> 01:26:17,890
yourself,
like a,

1792
01:26:17,890 --> 01:26:20,450
when you have a car or a boat or 
something,

1793
01:26:20,451 --> 01:26:24,380
can you fix the technology yourself?
Does it belong to you,

1794
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:29,560
do control it or not?
I think you're talking about things in 

1795
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:32,270
practical sense in a practical sense,
and I agree with you in a practical sort

1796
01:26:32,271 --> 01:26:33,350
of a pragmatic approach.

1797
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:38,680
I'm extrapolating a hundred years from 
now when it all it's nonsense because 

1798
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:42,731
I'm saying there's going to be come a 
time in the future where there are no 

1799
01:26:42,731 --> 01:26:42,731
natural athletes because there's no 
natural.

1800
01:26:42,731 --> 01:26:47,471
People were probably just a few years 
away from being symbiotically connected 

1801
01:26:49,281 --> 01:26:53,420
to electronics.
We're pretty close now with phones.

1802
01:26:53,421 --> 01:26:54,990
Will you leave the house without your 
phone?

1803
01:26:55,020 --> 01:27:00,020
You freak out.
[inaudible] met very few people live 

1804
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:00,260
without a car.
You know you have your navigation system

1805
01:27:00,261 --> 01:27:05,261
to get you around.
I don't really remember like three or 

1806
01:27:05,261 --> 01:27:05,261
four phone numbers now.
When I was a kid,

1807
01:27:05,261 --> 01:27:07,400
I remembered everybody's number.
I can be able to call my friends.

1808
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:12,560
I been able to call my house,
I barely know my own home number now 

1809
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,180
when I give someone my cell phone number
after think,

1810
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:15,860
you know,
have to think about that number.

1811
01:27:15,950 --> 01:27:18,410
So you'll get both.
You do give up some of your control.

1812
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:23,470
You didn't Google you get,
you get all sorts of good shit as well.

1813
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:27,160
I think drew and the bad shit that comes
with it.

1814
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:29,340
Um,
so you know what,

1815
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:32,210
50 years ago they started or maybe 
longer,

1816
01:27:32,211 --> 01:27:37,211
I don't know,
they started making a fucking process 

1817
01:27:37,211 --> 01:27:37,211
foods and that was like the best thing 
ever.

1818
01:27:37,211 --> 01:27:38,710
Oh my God,
we don't have to fuck it,

1819
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:40,280
cook our food anymore,
throw it,

1820
01:27:40,281 --> 01:27:45,281
you know,
have it made for us in a factory and we 

1821
01:27:45,281 --> 01:27:45,281
just throw it in the oven and it's done.
Boom.

1822
01:27:45,281 --> 01:27:46,910
This is the greatest thing ever.
You know,

1823
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:51,980
fast forward 30,
40 years and now we're fat and unhealthy

1824
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:57,460
and you know,
in our trans fats are national grop for,

1825
01:27:57,820 --> 01:28:00,380
for our healthcare is fucking,
you know,

1826
01:28:00,390 --> 01:28:05,390
or our healthcare cost exceeds our 
fucking gross domestic product for the 

1827
01:28:05,390 --> 01:28:06,770
fucking United States.
If it were just,

1828
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,900
you know there's.

1829
01:28:09,070 --> 01:28:10,430
There's good parts of it.
Yeah,

1830
01:28:10,431 --> 01:28:15,431
they made.
They probably made food safer in a 

1831
01:28:15,431 --> 01:28:17,801
sense.
Less people are dying from fucking 

1832
01:28:17,801 --> 01:28:17,801
listeria outbreaks and that sort of 
thing,

1833
01:28:17,801 --> 01:28:21,290
but on the flip side of that,
now we're really fucking sick and fat.

1834
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:23,030
One hundred percent agree with you 
Carlos,

1835
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:25,670
because it's not like you could say,
wait,

1836
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:30,820
that's.
We won't be very one with this will 

1837
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:33,191
happen.
There will be some adverse consequences 

1838
01:28:33,191 --> 01:28:33,620
to the whole this,
to all of these,

1839
01:28:33,621 --> 01:28:36,620
but we won't see it.
It's already here.

1840
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:39,920
It's already altering people's life 
today as we speak,

1841
01:28:39,921 --> 01:28:44,921
that people are listening to us.
Maybe you know suffering from this and 

1842
01:28:44,921 --> 01:28:48,191
that they don't even the why.
Well maybe you're surrounded by 

1843
01:28:48,191 --> 01:28:51,170
thousands and thousands of chemicals in 
older hygiene products that you know,

1844
01:28:51,171 --> 01:28:54,230
that you breathe that go through your 
pores that go in your system,

1845
01:28:54,231 --> 01:28:59,060
that after your home,
a homeless sizes and stuff like that.

1846
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:03,210
Maybe you're eating GMO.
Maybe it's everything is altered in your

1847
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:08,210
day to day life and you see it as 
something normal means you don't see it 

1848
01:29:08,210 --> 01:29:09,390
basically,
and as an it doesn't bother you.

1849
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:15,260
You're not conscious of it,
but it does bother you and how well you 

1850
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:19,041
live.
Well and and ultimately somebody is 

1851
01:29:19,041 --> 01:29:20,900
profiting right then.
That's the thing is with,

1852
01:29:20,930 --> 01:29:25,930
with any of this stuff,
I mean it will become the norm if 

1853
01:29:25,930 --> 01:29:26,610
somebody is profiting off.
Sure they can sell it to you.

1854
01:29:26,850 --> 01:29:31,850
If they can,
if they can convince you that this is 

1855
01:29:31,850 --> 01:29:31,850
better,
whether it is or whether it's not,

1856
01:29:31,850 --> 01:29:33,630
but you know,
through whatever,

1857
01:29:33,690 --> 01:29:38,690
they're already selling water to us.
Maybe they'll sell air to us or are they

1858
01:29:40,051 --> 01:29:42,840
in some places provide canned air in 
China.

1859
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:45,060
Let me think.
They buy canned air with the little mask

1860
01:29:45,061 --> 01:29:46,410
on it.
You suck the candidate.

1861
01:29:46,790 --> 01:29:48,480
I've done that.
India and Japan.

1862
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:51,210
Air Made My.
Made my veins.

1863
01:29:51,211 --> 01:29:53,010
Blue was wild.
Yeah.

1864
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:54,270
Why?
Yeah,

1865
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:59,420
because you had so much pure oxygen.
You could get it at like seven slash 11 

1866
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:01,860
over there next to the weird squid hot 
dogs.

1867
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:08,690
I did a an oxygen bar wants in Vegas.
They remember they used to have those 

1868
01:30:08,730 --> 01:30:09,930
still around.
I think they do.

1869
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:12,510
You put like a little pipe up your nose 
and I'm supposed to be like,

1870
01:30:12,511 --> 01:30:13,890
what am I supposed to be getting out of 
this?

1871
01:30:13,891 --> 01:30:16,230
Yeah.
It's like one of those oxygen things you

1872
01:30:16,231 --> 01:30:18,640
see old smokers will roll around with.
Yeah,

1873
01:30:18,641 --> 01:30:20,400
totally.
And the thing goes up your nose.

1874
01:30:20,401 --> 01:30:22,350
These little tubes go up your nose and 
we're sitting there going,

1875
01:30:22,351 --> 01:30:23,310
okay,
what am I supposed to feel?

1876
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:28,550
A sense of euphoria of extra energy,
and the cute chick that works there 

1877
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:29,310
comes up and rubs your back.

1878
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:31,950
That's that weird thing on your scalp 
and you kind of shit.

1879
01:30:31,951 --> 01:30:36,951
I thought good,
but it wouldn't come to come to a mind 

1880
01:30:36,951 --> 01:30:41,151
to do something like that.
If you were in the mountain and the air 

1881
01:30:41,151 --> 01:30:41,151
is pure surrounded by trees.
Why?

1882
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:45,180
Why on earth would you try to put some 
whatever oxygen in your in your brain,

1883
01:30:45,181 --> 01:30:46,020
you don't need it?
Well,

1884
01:30:46,021 --> 01:30:51,021
that's one of the things that I love 
about forests and trees that you can 

1885
01:30:51,021 --> 01:30:55,760
physically feel the difference in the 
air because trees literally absorb 

1886
01:30:56,370 --> 01:31:00,300
carbon dioxide and express oxygen.
They produce oxygen.

1887
01:31:00,301 --> 01:31:01,200
You breathe it in.
It feels.

1888
01:31:01,201 --> 01:31:06,201
My point is that you need these 
enhancements when you're already living 

1889
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:09,540
within an environment that is a 
tremendously deteriorate,

1890
01:31:09,940 --> 01:31:11,220
completely altered.
Then you're like,

1891
01:31:11,221 --> 01:31:14,190
oh my God,
I need their air and more natural food.

1892
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:16,950
I need to try to make my even my,
my,

1893
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:19,230
my house a bit more complex.

1894
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:22,230
It stimulates my movement and things 
like that.

1895
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:26,610
That's because you were already out of a
universally,

1896
01:31:26,611 --> 01:31:31,611
I would say universally natural 
environment comprising not just where 

1897
01:31:31,611 --> 01:31:32,760
you are,
but what you eat,

1898
01:31:32,761 --> 01:31:34,140
how you breathe,
the light,

1899
01:31:34,590 --> 01:31:36,210
and even your home.
You own behaviors,

1900
01:31:36,211 --> 01:31:38,850
how much you sleep,
how you think.

1901
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:43,880
All of that is behavior and environment 
that will impact you positively or not 

1902
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:47,970
in term of how.
How will you look,

1903
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,310
how well you perform,
how you feel.

1904
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:52,710
It all matters.
All these variables matter.

1905
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:53,430
What?
When?

1906
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:55,500
What is your diet like when you're 
training?

1907
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:57,840
Do you have someone who monitors that 
stuff?

1908
01:31:57,841 --> 01:32:00,040
Do you have a dietician that you work 
with or anything?

1909
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:02,460
So I worked with,
uh,

1910
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:05,710
with my dolce for this last camp,
this last cut.

1911
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:09,060
Um,
I met Mike when I was with my knee was,

1912
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:10,060
was,
was hurting.

1913
01:32:10,061 --> 01:32:12,040
I was in recovery for that.
Um,

1914
01:32:12,230 --> 01:32:17,230
it was doing some seminars.
He was going and doing these talks at 

1915
01:32:17,230 --> 01:32:18,730
some military bases on diet and 
nutrition,

1916
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:22,870
holistic living and um,
they brought me out,

1917
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:24,970
you know,
as the special guest or whatever.

1918
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:25,660
And I,
and I,

1919
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:26,690
you know,
I spoke on a too,

1920
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:27,670
but,
uh,

1921
01:32:27,830 --> 01:32:30,600
our,
our philosophies on,

1922
01:32:30,601 --> 01:32:32,760
on food and nutrition clicked.
I mean they were,

1923
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:37,761
there pretty much aligned.
We have a little bit different 

1924
01:32:37,761 --> 01:32:37,761
approaches.
Um,

1925
01:32:37,761 --> 01:32:41,930
I started learning about nutrition from 
a strict,

1926
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:44,170
excuse me,
the strength and conditioning coach when

1927
01:32:44,171 --> 01:32:45,970
I was about 19 years old up to that 
point.

1928
01:32:45,971 --> 01:32:46,690
It was,
it was,

1929
01:32:46,950 --> 01:32:47,860
you know,
whatever.

1930
01:32:47,870 --> 01:32:52,870
I fucking eaten off the dollar value 
meal at Wendy's.

1931
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:53,730
Really?
Yeah.

1932
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,020
Yeah.
During the time you're like fighting the

1933
01:32:56,021 --> 01:32:57,280
WEC or.
No,

1934
01:32:57,310 --> 01:32:58,400
this was before then.
This was,

1935
01:32:58,460 --> 01:33:03,460
I was fighting in like little little 
casinos out in the middle of the desert 

1936
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:07,170
in New Mexico and like making $200 for a
fight if you're lucky at a 400 person 

1937
01:33:07,301 --> 01:33:08,620
venue.
Um,

1938
01:33:08,770 --> 01:33:09,760
and yeah,
so it was like,

1939
01:33:09,761 --> 01:33:14,761
oh,
if I only eat half of this four piece 

1940
01:33:14,761 --> 01:33:14,761
nuggets,
I'm definitely gonna make wait tomorrow.

1941
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,770
Yeah.
And you know,

1942
01:33:16,850 --> 01:33:18,760
yeah.
I vividly remember those days.

1943
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Anyway,
I got with this guy and he just kind of 

1944
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:24,000
taught me the basics,
you know,

1945
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,960
basically taught me,
taught me about macronutrients and he 

1946
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:30,490
mainly a train bodybuilders but gave me 
some basics.

1947
01:33:30,491 --> 01:33:35,491
And then since since that point I've,
you know,

1948
01:33:36,551 --> 01:33:38,500
uh,
through my own practice,

1949
01:33:38,501 --> 01:33:41,680
through my own practical applications of
running through these training camps,

1950
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:43,150
running through,
um,

1951
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:45,530
the,
these weight cuts and,

1952
01:33:45,630 --> 01:33:50,630
and absorbing information,
going out there and looking at 

1953
01:33:50,630 --> 01:33:50,630
information myself,
um,

1954
01:33:50,630 --> 01:33:53,560
have kind of figured it out on pretty 
much on my own.

1955
01:33:53,830 --> 01:33:55,330
And uh,
I cook,

1956
01:33:55,350 --> 01:33:57,020
I fuckin love to cook.
That's my,

1957
01:33:57,160 --> 01:34:00,700
my hobby.
And so that helps out because,

1958
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:01,200
you know,
I'm,

1959
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:04,360
I'm cooking at for fun,
like kind of as a,

1960
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:07,890
as a Cathartic thing after I'm training,
but it,

1961
01:34:07,891 --> 01:34:12,891
it works well because I'm cooking the 
nutrient dense food that I need to 

1962
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:18,280
perform and to train and to make weight 
and to be a high level athlete.

1963
01:34:18,550 --> 01:34:23,140
I saw that you and Irwin,
we're working on bowhunting exercises.

1964
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:24,510
Do you do,
do bowhunting?

1965
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:25,620
Uh,
yes.

1966
01:34:25,621 --> 01:34:26,350
I,
I started,

1967
01:34:26,590 --> 01:34:31,450
started bowhunting three years ago.
I have yet to fucking kill anything.

1968
01:34:33,110 --> 01:34:36,100
I am not,
I'm very much a novice.

1969
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:38,740
But uh,
you know,

1970
01:34:38,741 --> 01:34:40,120
I'm learning.
And uh,

1971
01:34:40,270 --> 01:34:41,710
is anybody teaching you A.
Yeah,

1972
01:34:41,711 --> 01:34:43,180
I've gone with some guys,
um,

1973
01:34:43,270 --> 01:34:45,190
some,
some older guys that are my dad's age.

1974
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,380
My Dad's not an outdoorsman at all.
Um,

1975
01:34:47,550 --> 01:34:49,120
you know,
he likes to fish but you know,

1976
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:52,270
he doesn't go farther than about 20 feet
away from his car to fish.

1977
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:53,290
So this,
all this stuff,

1978
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:55,480
or one,
if you could back that up a bit,

1979
01:34:55,481 --> 01:34:56,170
please,
Jamie,

1980
01:34:56,350 --> 01:34:58,130
to that bow hunting thing that you just

1981
01:34:58,140 --> 01:35:03,140
show,
showed what is exactly is involved in 

1982
01:35:03,180 --> 01:35:06,200
these bowhunting exercises that you've 
got them doing.

1983
01:35:07,070 --> 01:35:10,610
So that was in between the two camps 
that we did together and uh,

1984
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:16,270
uh,
Carlos already knew he was going to 

1985
01:35:16,270 --> 01:35:17,240
fight Robbie lawler.
She left,

1986
01:35:17,390 --> 01:35:22,140
but it was a somewhere or just just 
fucking around Baltimore and yeah.

1987
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:27,460
Yeah,
it was somewhere a late September if I 

1988
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:27,460
remember.
Well.

1989
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:30,461
And um,
New Mexico is the best spot to hunt elk 

1990
01:35:30,461 --> 01:35:31,840
next to Colorado,
New Mexico and Colorado.

1991
01:35:31,860 --> 01:35:33,710
These spots in this country,
you.

1992
01:35:33,730 --> 01:35:36,880
Mexico is the best place to live.
Really?

1993
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:38,390
Think.
Well,

1994
01:35:38,391 --> 01:35:38,810
no.
Listen,

1995
01:35:38,830 --> 01:35:40,480
listen,
let's keep it a secret.

1996
01:35:40,481 --> 01:35:41,750
But what,
why do you say that?

1997
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:43,480
Um,
Diego Sanchez lives there.

1998
01:35:46,510 --> 01:35:48,110
Yes.
The beauty,

1999
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:49,630
the landscapes.
But,

2000
01:35:49,730 --> 01:35:54,730
but again,
it's the people will prefer another 

2001
01:35:54,730 --> 01:35:54,730
place,
but,

2002
01:35:54,730 --> 01:35:54,800
but there's a certain energy,
you know,

2003
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:58,660
some places resonate with you more than 
others.

2004
01:35:58,670 --> 01:35:59,170
Me,
ah,

2005
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,940
I moved to Santa Fe,
New Mexico,

2006
01:36:01,941 --> 01:36:03,110
never,
never left.

2007
01:36:03,111 --> 01:36:05,140
And then find a Jessica,
the,

2008
01:36:05,190 --> 01:36:10,190
you know,
my soul mate and up and everything is 

2009
01:36:10,190 --> 01:36:10,190
beautiful there.
And will your cheeses,

2010
01:36:10,190 --> 01:36:11,930
it's a perfect place to live in Santa 
Fe.

2011
01:36:12,170 --> 01:36:17,170
A lot of hippies.
You got a scarf on even though you're 

2012
01:36:17,170 --> 01:36:17,270
indoors.
I'm European,

2013
01:36:17,271 --> 01:36:18,720
I can afford it.
Whatever,

2014
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:20,840
you know.
I'm French.

2015
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:26,500
So when you said to that guy,
fuck you.

2016
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:30,680
Oh,
so what you love?

2017
01:36:31,010 --> 01:36:33,710
You Love New Mexico,
New Mexico.

2018
01:36:34,390 --> 01:36:36,950
I'm a,
I'm a new Mexican now.

2019
01:36:36,951 --> 01:36:38,030
I can feel it,
you know,

2020
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:42,390
like they say a born here on my life,
but definitely don't sound like,

2021
01:36:42,410 --> 01:36:47,410
you know,
I have a profound love for these land 

2022
01:36:47,410 --> 01:36:48,380
there where I live.

2023
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:52,100
It's surrounded by 19 Pueblos on native 
Indian energy,

2024
01:36:52,101 --> 01:36:54,410
which I really relate to.
And um,

2025
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:59,620
oh.
So you can go and see these ancient 

2026
01:36:59,620 --> 01:36:59,620
sites where they used to live.
You can,

2027
01:36:59,620 --> 01:36:59,960
you can,
they still live there?

2028
01:36:59,961 --> 01:37:04,210
And some of them right?
Like in the mountains,

2029
01:37:04,890 --> 01:37:05,810
the mountains,
the.

2030
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:06,860
Yeah.
Well the,

2031
01:37:06,861 --> 01:37:11,861
yeah.
There's lots of emotions kind of old 

2032
01:37:11,861 --> 01:37:13,060
school,
like,

2033
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:17,210
like a stone age apartment buildings.
And they didn't,

2034
01:37:17,220 --> 01:37:20,510
they have cable and now they have cable.
Yeah,

2035
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:20,900
yeah.
Well,

2036
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:21,440
they got,
yeah,

2037
01:37:21,441 --> 01:37:24,410
they got satellites hanging off the side
of him now and yeah.

2038
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:25,670
Yeah.
Oh my God.

2039
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:28,040
Dad,
if you ever come out to New Mexico,

2040
01:37:28,041 --> 01:37:30,160
I'll take you by Akamai.
I'm going wild.

2041
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:35,320
I've been thinking about going into 
Mexico and doing a show there for 

2042
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:35,320
awhile.
I want,

2043
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:38,220
I want to do something.
Probably Albuquerque is a good place to 

2044
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:38,220
go,
right?

2045
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:38,220
Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
Where should I go?

2046
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:40,500
A Santa Fe is an hour away,
so come in Albuquerque and then boom,

2047
01:37:40,790 --> 01:37:42,260
boom.
There's a lot of stuff right around.

2048
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:43,840
Come on.
Okay.

2049
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:44,750
Okay.
Yeah.

2050
01:37:45,130 --> 01:37:45,860
Uh,
there's,

2051
01:37:45,861 --> 01:37:48,030
there's the,
the Apache caged area,

2052
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:50,240
Apache,
Ms Dot petree reservations.

2053
01:37:50,330 --> 01:37:53,270
It's still there.
It's really a lot of grit,

2054
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:55,830
that energy,
a lot of cool stuff.

2055
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:56,070
But

2056
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:58,440
it's a secret.
Let's not talk about it too late.

2057
01:38:00,210 --> 01:38:02,940
So with regards to the,
the honestly,

2058
01:38:02,941 --> 01:38:07,160
the stuff that we were doing wasn't a 
whole lot different than a,

2059
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:09,600
what we're working on for the training 
camps,

2060
01:38:09,601 --> 01:38:12,060
you know,
we're working on foot,

2061
01:38:12,061 --> 01:38:12,990
ankle,
knee,

2062
01:38:12,991 --> 01:38:17,730
hip stability in complex environments,
in walking on,

2063
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:23,240
walking on logs are navigating different
terrain while staying aware of my 

2064
01:38:23,281 --> 01:38:24,120
surroundings.
You know,

2065
01:38:24,121 --> 01:38:27,970
if I'm fucking sitting there looking at 
my feet and stumbling over myself and,

2066
01:38:28,090 --> 01:38:33,090
and worrying so much about being quiet 
and where I'm standing fucking I miss 

2067
01:38:33,090 --> 01:38:34,180
miss a Goddamn,
you know,

2068
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:39,200
some something right there.
And I'm feeling with your feet saying 

2069
01:38:40,531 --> 01:38:45,531
that,
that Irwin has that helped me out quite 

2070
01:38:45,531 --> 01:38:48,081
a bit as kind of a coaching cue is put 
your mind in your feet so that I'm 

2071
01:38:49,381 --> 01:38:52,590
looking here and I'm aware of what's 
going on around me,

2072
01:38:52,591 --> 01:38:54,300
but I can feel where I'm going.

2073
01:38:54,330 --> 01:38:55,230
Boom.
I,

2074
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:58,890
I hunted like a,
like minimal boots so I can,

2075
01:38:58,990 --> 01:39:00,870
you know,
I could feel if I'm about to crack that,

2076
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:03,000
that stick and make that,
you know,

2077
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:04,180
what kind of boosts who are,
like,

2078
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:06,120
they're,
they're called,

2079
01:39:06,210 --> 01:39:08,620
the ones I use are called mini mill.
Um,

2080
01:39:08,670 --> 01:39:13,670
and they are high a,
m I n I am I l l I think is what it is.

2081
01:39:15,570 --> 01:39:17,250
And they're,
they're dope man.

2082
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:20,010
So I think initially,
uh,

2083
01:39:20,011 --> 01:39:20,580
the,
the,

2084
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:23,570
the vibrams fivefingers came into vogue 
in,

2085
01:39:23,571 --> 01:39:24,530
in the military.
They,

2086
01:39:24,531 --> 01:39:25,580
they loved it,
right?

2087
01:39:25,590 --> 01:39:27,660
And everybody was all about the,
uh,

2088
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,290
the minimal footwear.
But if you go to minimal,

2089
01:39:31,291 --> 01:39:36,291
too fast,
you're going to hurt your feet because 

2090
01:39:36,291 --> 01:39:36,291
our feet,
our bones,

2091
01:39:36,291 --> 01:39:40,461
our tendons,
our muscles are atrophied from being in 

2092
01:39:40,461 --> 01:39:41,960
basically casts for,
for,

2093
01:39:41,961 --> 01:39:42,350
you know,
our,

2094
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:47,480
our entire life and all of a sudden I'm 
going to go run a couple miles like I 

2095
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:47,480
did in these supportive shoes.

2096
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:48,660
And you're going to get stress 
fractures,

2097
01:39:48,661 --> 01:39:49,950
you're going to get all kinds of 
injuries.

2098
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:51,930
Um,
so I think the military,

2099
01:39:52,230 --> 01:39:54,030
a couple of the branches,
band,

2100
01:39:54,031 --> 01:39:56,940
the band,
the five finger shoes or the five.

2101
01:39:56,950 --> 01:39:57,850
Yeah.
And that's what they're called.

2102
01:39:57,851 --> 01:40:00,420
There's people getting hurt because your
foot injuries,

2103
01:40:00,610 --> 01:40:02,950
what are lots.
Lots of people,

2104
01:40:03,050 --> 01:40:06,580
people's body's physiology are just not 
ready to strike.

2105
01:40:06,890 --> 01:40:08,800
And you have to work your way up to 
fight.

2106
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:09,330
And this.
Yeah.

2107
01:40:09,690 --> 01:40:12,240
This guy runs,
runs barefoot throughout,

2108
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:13,890
through the mountains.
You run barefoot.

2109
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:14,820
Yeah.
Yeah.

2110
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:17,160
Don't wear any shoes at all.
No.

2111
01:40:17,190 --> 01:40:19,410
Well sometimes,
but it depends on what I do,

2112
01:40:19,411 --> 01:40:24,411
but I do try and also to be barefoot 
because it makes me extremely sharp 

2113
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,700
mentally.
You have to be extremely focused,

2114
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:32,070
just not injure yourself to be 
extremely,

2115
01:40:32,071 --> 01:40:32,960
uh,
adaptable.

2116
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:35,250
So he doesn't just drained,
people think,

2117
01:40:35,251 --> 01:40:35,670
oh,
okay,

2118
01:40:35,671 --> 01:40:37,610
so it's gonna make your,
uh,

2119
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:40,220
the sole of your foot tougher.
What about that?

2120
01:40:40,270 --> 01:40:42,420
What's special about that?
But that's not the point.

2121
01:40:42,421 --> 01:40:47,280
That's not much many more benefits 
beyond just making your feet tougher.

2122
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:50,730
It's so fascinating that when in the 
invention of the running shoe,

2123
01:40:50,731 --> 01:40:52,650
which what they thought was an 
advancement,

2124
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:53,830
oh,
we're going put cushioning.

2125
01:40:53,831 --> 01:40:53,970
It'll

2126
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:55,920
save people's bodies,
the wear and tear,

2127
01:40:55,940 --> 01:40:59,410
and it actually wound up fucking people 
up and getting more injured.

2128
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:04,500
The food is a masterpiece.
There's nothing to change about about 

2129
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:07,420
it.
Human food is a masterpiece and a,

2130
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:12,750
yeah,
you try to come up with some science 

2131
01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:15,640
caring science shoes,
footwear.

2132
01:41:16,620 --> 01:41:21,620
It's bullshit,
but also just need minimal minimal 

2133
01:41:21,620 --> 01:41:23,530
protection to avoid abrasion and end 
punctures and things like that.

2134
01:41:23,890 --> 01:41:26,390
But otherwise you need to lead the work,
uh,

2135
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:30,940
the work as naturally as possible.
And if you don't then you will make your

2136
01:41:30,941 --> 01:41:32,430
feet weaker,
right?

2137
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:33,340
It will,
it will,

2138
01:41:33,370 --> 01:41:35,680
it will shrink it,
it will numb it.

2139
01:41:36,190 --> 01:41:38,680
But then on the flip side of that coin,
I can't,

2140
01:41:38,681 --> 01:41:43,681
my feet aren't strong enough to just go 
and run as I would normally in 

2141
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:46,300
completely minimal shoes.
I have to kick back,

2142
01:41:46,301 --> 01:41:48,670
I have to kick back the intensity and 
the distance.

2143
01:41:49,510 --> 01:41:51,250
So if I really want to get a really 
hard,

2144
01:41:51,251 --> 01:41:52,840
hard run in and,
and,

2145
01:41:52,930 --> 01:41:54,700
and get,
get fatigued,

2146
01:41:54,701 --> 01:41:56,380
I need,
I throw on some,

2147
01:41:56,410 --> 01:41:59,200
some regular old running shoes.
Shorter distances.

2148
01:41:59,201 --> 01:42:04,201
I'm,
I'm like specifically training my feet 

2149
01:42:04,201 --> 01:42:04,201
and you know,
and,

2150
01:42:04,201 --> 01:42:04,201
and,
and,

2151
01:42:04,390 --> 01:42:05,020
and,
uh,

2152
01:42:05,450 --> 01:42:10,450
uh,
conditioning my tissues and everything 

2153
01:42:10,450 --> 01:42:10,450
to be able to do that.
And that's,

2154
01:42:10,450 --> 01:42:11,520
you know,
that's kind of a,

2155
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:12,970
a distinction.
And,

2156
01:42:13,030 --> 01:42:14,860
and,
and moving to hurt myself,

2157
01:42:15,610 --> 01:42:18,090
moving,
moving barefoot in wall and environments

2158
01:42:18,110 --> 01:42:19,180
is not,
um,

2159
01:42:20,350 --> 01:42:23,140
it's not men mandatory to people say one
a mandatory,

2160
01:42:24,610 --> 01:42:29,610
forgive my French.
I just thought when I have to do the 

2161
01:42:29,610 --> 01:42:30,580
math in my head as to what you said,
I feel like I have to clarify for people

2162
01:42:30,700 --> 01:42:32,740
as well.
That's good.

2163
01:42:32,770 --> 01:42:33,880
Thanks.
Um,

2164
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:34,650
yeah,
you don't have,

2165
01:42:34,930 --> 01:42:37,000
it's not mandatory.
Mandatory.

2166
01:42:37,030 --> 01:42:39,870
Mandatory.
Mandatory correcting.

2167
01:42:39,980 --> 01:42:41,890
Sorry,
my English is very good.

2168
01:42:41,891 --> 01:42:43,420
English was better than my French.

2169
01:42:44,740 --> 01:42:46,420
Um,
you,

2170
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:50,010
you start,
you start a resetting your body in a,

2171
01:42:50,011 --> 01:42:55,011
in a,
in a more natural way through these 

2172
01:42:55,011 --> 01:42:57,990
natural movement patterns,
and you can do that in indoors 

2173
01:42:57,990 --> 01:43:00,421
environment,
even wearing some minimal footwear and 

2174
01:43:00,421 --> 01:43:03,931
then you remove a footwear and then you 
start to expose the body through these 

2175
01:43:03,931 --> 01:43:06,100
natural movement on more challenging,
more complex environments.

2176
01:43:06,101 --> 01:43:08,710
Ultimately if you want to,
you can become,

2177
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:14,160
you can go through these more say bad 
ass trainings where it's like the real 

2178
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:14,170
deal.
You're in the wild.

2179
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:17,650
They're maybe cactus and sharp stones 
and all kinds of things.

2180
01:43:17,651 --> 01:43:18,470
And,
and,

2181
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:19,310
and,
and,

2182
01:43:19,330 --> 01:43:24,330
and still you can do that,
but that doesn't mean that you have to 

2183
01:43:24,330 --> 01:43:24,940
do that right away.
Or did you ever have to do that?

2184
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:26,600
Um,
uh,

2185
01:43:26,710 --> 01:43:29,510
the bowhunting practice was,
yeah,

2186
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:35,240
these balancing movements.
The point was not just the movement 

2187
01:43:35,501 --> 01:43:38,920
itself is when you move in complex 
environments,

2188
01:43:39,370 --> 01:43:40,870
there are also situations.

2189
01:43:40,870 --> 01:43:41,410
If,
for instance,

2190
01:43:41,411 --> 01:43:45,520
you're hunting,
you'll goal is to catch the game.

2191
01:43:46,090 --> 01:43:48,040
So you need to be aware of what's going 
on.

2192
01:43:48,070 --> 01:43:53,070
You need to avoid being detected and you
need to look and scan your surroundings 

2193
01:43:53,271 --> 01:43:56,510
and be as light as possible,
a silent as possible.

2194
01:43:57,530 --> 01:43:59,570
If you're already in trouble with your 
movement.

2195
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:02,570
If you're already struggling,
we have a movement.

2196
01:44:02,571 --> 01:44:07,571
How much of your brain activity and 
awareness is going to be dedicated to 

2197
01:44:07,571 --> 01:44:10,410
the situation itself,
which is the hunting part because the,

2198
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:12,110
the,
the movement part in the,

2199
01:44:12,111 --> 01:44:15,380
in the environment part is already.
It's not there.

2200
01:44:15,410 --> 01:44:17,300
Your struggling.
Uh,

2201
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:19,140
it's not just a matter of,
oh,

2202
01:44:19,141 --> 01:44:20,480
I have some cardio,
so I'm good.

2203
01:44:20,510 --> 01:44:25,510
No,
well maybe you have hard time just 

2204
01:44:25,510 --> 01:44:25,510
kneeling,
getting up and getting down,

2205
01:44:25,610 --> 01:44:30,610
let alone in a supple silence move way 
that is not the deck detectable.

2206
01:44:31,791 --> 01:44:32,050
So what?

2207
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:33,890
Well,
learning kind of things were trending,

2208
01:44:34,060 --> 01:44:36,600
bow hunting in particular,
sort of experienced this,

2209
01:44:36,610 --> 01:44:38,850
uh,
most recently,

2210
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:44,240
this fitness mo movement where a lot of 
guys are getting in extremely good shape

2211
01:44:45,091 --> 01:44:50,091
to be able to run the mountains so that 
they can hike long distances and not be 

2212
01:44:51,061 --> 01:44:54,420
fatigued and so that they can take shots
like in,

2213
01:44:54,421 --> 01:44:59,421
have some mobility where you can be on 
your knees and for long periods of time 

2214
01:44:59,421 --> 01:45:03,291
you might have to be held at full draw 
while animals looking at you after 

2215
01:45:03,291 --> 01:45:06,350
having run up a hill.
You're fatigued.

2216
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:06,940
Yeah.
Yeah.

2217
01:45:06,950 --> 01:45:09,840
And it's the difference between being 
successful and not being successful.

2218
01:45:09,841 --> 01:45:11,820
I mean in today's day you could still go
to the supermarket,

2219
01:45:11,821 --> 01:45:15,330
but ultimately what it means is whether 
or not you can eat or not eat.

2220
01:45:15,510 --> 01:45:19,530
So you have to be in physical shape to 
be able to do that kind of hunting.

2221
01:45:19,710 --> 01:45:23,010
And a lot of it is at high altitudes.
So you're trudging through the mountains

2222
01:45:23,011 --> 01:45:25,290
of low oxygen.
The body and mind I have

2223
01:45:25,290 --> 01:45:29,820
to deal with so many diverse variable 
changing in.

2224
01:45:29,821 --> 01:45:30,960
That's,
that's again,

2225
01:45:30,961 --> 01:45:35,110
that's adaptability.
It's about adaptability a gut.

2226
01:45:35,190 --> 01:45:36,500
The chance,
uh,

2227
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:39,240
to,
to train the seals in Coronado,

2228
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:41,250
and these guys are well,
number one,

2229
01:45:41,251 --> 01:45:43,090
they are gentlemen,
they are real good,

2230
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:48,170
good people,
but they are extremely fit from the 

2231
01:45:48,170 --> 01:45:48,170
stance,
uh,

2232
01:45:48,170 --> 01:45:51,870
the standpoint of how much they can run,
how much they can end dirt,

2233
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:55,800
but I would challenge them with very 
simple movements,

2234
01:45:55,801 --> 01:46:00,801
a chai,
some of the movements with Trent 

2235
01:46:00,801 --> 01:46:00,801
together with Carlos,
uh,

2236
01:46:00,801 --> 01:46:03,650
the,
when you were in that split squat 

2237
01:46:03,650 --> 01:46:03,650
position,
and you pivot,

2238
01:46:03,650 --> 01:46:07,310
reverse your orientation from forward to
backward and while maybe holding a stick

2239
01:46:09,841 --> 01:46:14,841
that represents a rifle or bow or via 
camera if you're shooting photos.

2240
01:46:15,390 --> 01:46:17,850
So if you're struggling with that 
movement,

2241
01:46:17,851 --> 01:46:20,310
you have imbalances.
How much,

2242
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:24,600
again of your situational awareness can 
be dedicated to the situation at hand,

2243
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:25,770
at stake.

2244
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:30,980
That's a good point.
You surviving the movement will excuse 

2245
01:46:30,980 --> 01:46:31,140
me in the close to the mic.
Oh,

2246
01:46:31,270 --> 01:46:33,420
alright.
And then for a split second or maybe for

2247
01:46:33,421 --> 01:46:34,710
a little longer,
a,

2248
01:46:34,711 --> 01:46:35,940
you're in trouble.
So,

2249
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:36,880
uh,
in,

2250
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:38,640
in,
in the cage situation,

2251
01:46:39,030 --> 01:46:42,690
it's very similar because you need to 
always keep an eye on your it.

2252
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:45,770
So you need that situational awareness.
Well.

2253
01:46:45,771 --> 01:46:48,960
So not having to think exclusively at 
how you move.

2254
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:53,280
So the more comfortable in movement,
the more fluid,

2255
01:46:53,430 --> 01:46:58,430
the more second nature it becomes,
then the more attention your brain can 

2256
01:46:58,741 --> 01:47:02,430
dedicate to the situation and to the 
adaptability,

2257
01:47:02,670 --> 01:47:04,050
the range,
the timing.

2258
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:09,320
All of these subtle little adaptations 
in your brain is in charge of brain 

2259
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:09,930
commands,
not the body.

2260
01:47:09,931 --> 01:47:12,730
So the money deans to be able to,
uh,

2261
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:14,030
to,
to,

2262
01:47:14,410 --> 01:47:19,410
to move a highly reliable way ultimately
that it is the movement itself or the 

2263
01:47:21,190 --> 01:47:24,270
situation,
situational awareness.

2264
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:27,420
It all boils down to the brain.

2265
01:47:28,660 --> 01:47:31,150
What I was getting at before with the 
bowhunting is a.

2266
01:47:31,170 --> 01:47:36,170
and with regards to your diet diet,
do you eat wild game or do you get like 

2267
01:47:36,170 --> 01:47:36,880
what I do?
Yeah.

2268
01:47:36,881 --> 01:47:41,881
Um,
mainly I eat a grass fed free range 

2269
01:47:42,550 --> 01:47:45,190
meats.
I get as much wild game as I can.

2270
01:47:45,340 --> 01:47:50,340
Like I said,
I didn't kill anything in the last two 

2271
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:50,340
years,
but the people that I,

2272
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:50,340
I did go with,
did they,

2273
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:51,640
they,
they harvest harvest elk.

2274
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:52,990
Um,
so,

2275
01:47:53,110 --> 01:47:54,760
you know,
we all share that meet.

2276
01:47:55,900 --> 01:47:57,180
So yeah,
I eat as,

2277
01:47:57,320 --> 01:48:02,320
as,
as much wild game as possible because I 

2278
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:02,320
feel like that's,
I mean,

2279
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:04,090
that's about as pure as you can get.
It really is healthy too.

2280
01:48:04,091 --> 01:48:09,091
When you eat it.
It does have a different effect on your 

2281
01:48:09,091 --> 01:48:09,091
body.
You can feel it if you're,

2282
01:48:09,091 --> 01:48:12,840
if you're health conscious and if you're
aware of what you're taking in on a 

2283
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:15,220
regular basis are sort of aware of how 
your body reacts.

2284
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:20,520
You'll see it,
you'll feel different when you eat wild 

2285
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:20,520
game.
It's just more nutrient dense.

2286
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:20,780
Yeah.
Yeah.

2287
01:48:20,781 --> 01:48:21,550
And,
and there's,

2288
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:23,200
you know,
there's other aspects to it,

2289
01:48:23,201 --> 01:48:23,980
man.
When you,

2290
01:48:23,981 --> 01:48:27,580
when you see the animal die or you kill 
the animal,

2291
01:48:27,581 --> 01:48:31,960
there's just a sense of gratitude.
I feel like for this thing,

2292
01:48:31,961 --> 01:48:36,961
giving its life to nourish your body as 
opposed to buying something in a nice 

2293
01:48:37,181 --> 01:48:40,120
little neat package with fucking Saran 
wrap over it.

2294
01:48:40,300 --> 01:48:42,540
You don't even,
you don't really think that a life was,

2295
01:48:42,700 --> 01:48:44,080
you know,
was separated,

2296
01:48:44,410 --> 01:48:47,080
um,
to give you two to nourish your body.

2297
01:48:47,081 --> 01:48:50,950
But when you,
when you go out and you see it or it's,

2298
01:48:50,951 --> 01:48:52,090
you know,
it's in front of you.

2299
01:48:52,091 --> 01:48:56,050
You realize that you're a little bit 
more connected to what you're putting in

2300
01:48:56,051 --> 01:49:00,460
your body and I think that disconnect is
a part of the um,

2301
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:03,670
uh,
the problem with our,

2302
01:49:03,671 --> 01:49:05,910
with our food,
you know,

2303
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:08,590
I guess sickness or food culture that 
we,

2304
01:49:08,591 --> 01:49:09,340
you know,
there were,

2305
01:49:09,820 --> 01:49:11,140
there were experiencing these days.

2306
01:49:11,370 --> 01:49:14,590
The gratitude is certainly an aspect of 
it and also the connection,

2307
01:49:14,620 --> 01:49:18,070
just to an understanding,
a real understanding of what happened,

2308
01:49:18,071 --> 01:49:19,570
how you got there,
what,

2309
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:22,060
what this meal is and it just,
it has,

2310
01:49:22,061 --> 01:49:23,800
it feels better.
It feels better to eat it.

2311
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:25,870
Yeah.
Yeah.

2312
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:30,340
It's a mix of things you,
you actually feel as opposed to just not

2313
01:49:30,341 --> 01:49:35,341
even thinking about.
Not even just now,

2314
01:49:36,010 --> 01:49:37,780
Mike Dolce you were saying,
uh,

2315
01:49:37,781 --> 01:49:40,810
works with you for,
or worked with you for this last camp.

2316
01:49:41,050 --> 01:49:42,410
What was the difference?
Like what,

2317
01:49:42,490 --> 01:49:45,020
what different things did you eat and 
what,

2318
01:49:45,190 --> 01:49:48,250
what approach did you take?
Did you do any work to examine

2319
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:50,140
your nutrient levels?
I did not.

2320
01:49:50,141 --> 01:49:51,750
I didn't do any blood work.
Um,

2321
01:49:52,120 --> 01:49:55,570
the difference was we didn't change what
I was eating.

2322
01:49:55,660 --> 01:49:59,020
We changed the structure and the timing 
of when I was eating,

2323
01:49:59,230 --> 01:49:59,970
um,
I,

2324
01:50:00,570 --> 01:50:03,120
I was kind of a man.
I didn't,

2325
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:04,780
I didn't have much of a structure.
I was like,

2326
01:50:04,781 --> 01:50:05,350
Oh,
you know,

2327
01:50:05,351 --> 01:50:07,350
I'm eating the right things.
I'm,

2328
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:08,350
I'm,
I'm good.

2329
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:09,760
Um,
he,

2330
01:50:11,050 --> 01:50:11,740
he's like,
okay,

2331
01:50:11,741 --> 01:50:12,340
well,
no,

2332
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:14,220
this is,
this is how we're going to do it.

2333
01:50:14,230 --> 01:50:14,740
We're gonna,
you know,

2334
01:50:14,810 --> 01:50:19,810
gonna do,
you're gonna sit down and you're going 

2335
01:50:19,810 --> 01:50:21,511
to eat till your full.
Every three hours you're going to have 

2336
01:50:21,511 --> 01:50:24,121
two feedings.
You're not going to kind of snack and 

2337
01:50:24,121 --> 01:50:24,121
graze here and there,
which is what I was doing.

2338
01:50:24,121 --> 01:50:25,750
Um,
and uh,

2339
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:30,400
do to increase my energy levels.
I'm immensely.

2340
01:50:30,850 --> 01:50:31,990
How,
so in what way?

2341
01:50:32,050 --> 01:50:33,400
I feel awesome.
So I,

2342
01:50:33,660 --> 01:50:35,770
I don't know why,
I don't know the physiology behind it,

2343
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:36,400
but,
um,

2344
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:39,670
I think it's a hormonal.

2345
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:42,100
I think I.
So after I would eat these big meals,

2346
01:50:42,101 --> 01:50:42,620
boom,
oh,

2347
01:50:42,690 --> 01:50:44,470
get,
I would get tired.

2348
01:50:44,590 --> 01:50:46,290
I get like a,
um,

2349
01:50:46,620 --> 01:50:48,250
kind of insulin dove,
you know,

2350
01:50:48,310 --> 01:50:51,010
be tired for a little while,
but the next time I went to train,

2351
01:50:51,011 --> 01:50:53,290
like I just felt like I had had more 
fuel.

2352
01:50:53,490 --> 01:50:54,670
Um,
you know,

2353
01:50:55,150 --> 01:51:00,150
more energy,
more sustenance for these training 

2354
01:51:00,150 --> 01:51:00,150
sessions.
Um,

2355
01:51:00,150 --> 01:51:03,520
and uh,
my weight cut was,

2356
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:05,170
I,
I've never had a weight cut as,

2357
01:51:05,230 --> 01:51:07,300
as easy as that we were eating,
you know,

2358
01:51:07,350 --> 01:51:12,350
f full large meals right up until the 
night or even the night night before 

2359
01:51:12,821 --> 01:51:14,290
weigh ins.
Why I was,

2360
01:51:14,291 --> 01:51:15,430
I was,
I was,

2361
01:51:16,060 --> 01:51:18,700
I came down so quickly and I,
I kind of have a weird deal,

2362
01:51:18,701 --> 01:51:19,140
man.
My,

2363
01:51:19,340 --> 01:51:20,590
I feel like my body,
I've,

2364
01:51:20,860 --> 01:51:22,600
I've cut weight so many times.
I have,

2365
01:51:22,930 --> 01:51:26,230
you know,
40 plus professional fights,

2366
01:51:26,250 --> 01:51:31,250
you know,
between kickboxing and MMA and I think 

2367
01:51:31,250 --> 01:51:31,250
my body just kind of knows.

2368
01:51:31,250 --> 01:51:32,590
It just drops.
Even Mike's like,

2369
01:51:32,591 --> 01:51:37,591
dude,
I've never worked with an athlete that 

2370
01:51:37,591 --> 01:51:37,591
just boom,
boom.

2371
01:51:37,591 --> 01:51:37,840
It was just,
it's just on a schedule,

2372
01:51:38,170 --> 01:51:39,820
it just might,
my weight drops.

2373
01:51:40,130 --> 01:51:41,860
Um,
and uh,

2374
01:51:42,430 --> 01:51:43,750
yeah,
but I felt,

2375
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:46,000
I felt amazing.
I felt good in the fight.

2376
01:51:46,001 --> 01:51:48,430
I think I look good in the fight.
I performed well.

2377
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:49,440
Um,
the,

2378
01:51:49,450 --> 01:51:51,340
the cut was,
the cut was awesome.

2379
01:51:51,610 --> 01:51:53,890
So you're eating big meals,
I mean,

2380
01:51:53,891 --> 01:51:56,590
fairly bi relative,
relatively big meals.

2381
01:51:56,591 --> 01:52:01,591
How many calories have encountered out?
So I would say I would have probably a,

2382
01:52:02,890 --> 01:52:05,980
a,
an eight ounce portion of,

2383
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:07,780
uh,
of Salmon.

2384
01:52:07,990 --> 01:52:12,310
I'm probably a cup of white rice and 
then a good amount of vegetables.

2385
01:52:12,510 --> 01:52:13,390
Um,
you know,

2386
01:52:13,391 --> 01:52:16,360
we're talking about several times a day.
Really?

2387
01:52:16,390 --> 01:52:17,110
Yeah.
Wow.

2388
01:52:17,111 --> 01:52:21,550
That's interesting because most people 
think of weight cuts being that,

2389
01:52:21,551 --> 01:52:26,551
you know,
you severely restrict the amount of 

2390
01:52:26,551 --> 01:52:29,041
calories you have.
Your body starts to go into ketosis or 

2391
01:52:29,041 --> 01:52:29,920
what have you,
starts absorbing fat instead of,

2392
01:52:29,921 --> 01:52:32,170
uh,
instead of carbohydrates,

2393
01:52:32,171 --> 01:52:34,570
you dehydrate yourself.
Then after that.

2394
01:52:34,571 --> 01:52:36,820
And that's how you get to that state.
Yeah.

2395
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:41,880
Well,
I mean that's one way to do it and I've 

2396
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:42,730
definitely done that way before.
I've done it.

2397
01:52:43,030 --> 01:52:48,030
A bunch of shitty.
What's the worst way you've ever done 

2398
01:52:48,030 --> 01:52:48,030
it?

2399
01:52:48,030 --> 01:52:51,840
Just the chicken nuggets way,
but hesitant right around that same 

2400
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:52,920
time.
Not,

2401
01:52:52,990 --> 01:52:54,320
not eating.
I remember.

2402
01:52:54,321 --> 01:52:58,520
So my first kickboxing fight ever,
I fought a guy named Andy Sour.

2403
01:52:58,521 --> 01:53:00,800
I don't know if you're familiar with it.
That was your first kick.

2404
01:53:00,801 --> 01:53:02,760
My first fight.
First kickboxing fight ever.

2405
01:53:02,770 --> 01:53:07,770
Fucking as that you're managing.
How long has andy been fighting then?

2406
01:53:07,970 --> 01:53:11,600
He already his record at the time,
I remember too,

2407
01:53:11,601 --> 01:53:15,230
and for some 93 in one.
Oh my God,

2408
01:53:15,231 --> 01:53:20,231
that's so insane.
It through when I was first kickboxing 

2409
01:53:20,231 --> 01:53:20,231
fat,
all my God.

2410
01:53:20,250 --> 01:53:23,240
So I was 12 and o as an mma is an MMA 
fighter.

2411
01:53:23,241 --> 01:53:25,490
Oh my God.
I was 19 years old.

2412
01:53:25,810 --> 01:53:30,810
Um,
I had maybe one or two amateur boxing 

2413
01:53:30,810 --> 01:53:32,620
fights and I had been training him or 
I'd been trying to kickboxing for a long

2414
01:53:32,630 --> 01:53:33,230
time,
but anyway,

2415
01:53:33,470 --> 01:53:36,440
I go up to 91,
1993 and one.

2416
01:53:36,680 --> 01:53:41,680
Oh Man.
What fucking governing body sanctioned 

2417
01:53:41,680 --> 01:53:41,680
that?
Uh,

2418
01:53:41,680 --> 01:53:43,730
it was in Japan was,
I was,

2419
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:46,790
I was the guy who lived in Japan.
Exactly.

2420
01:53:46,850 --> 01:53:48,830
I was the guy that they were bringing in
for the slaughter.

2421
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:50,710
Oh my God.
Uh,

2422
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:53,420
I,
I show up out there and I'm only,

2423
01:53:53,421 --> 01:53:58,421
I think I remember I was only like eight
pounds out and we didn't know what the 

2424
01:53:58,421 --> 01:54:02,411
fuck we were doing with,
with regards to the weight cut at the 

2425
01:54:02,411 --> 01:54:02,411
time I was 19.
And so I'm like,

2426
01:54:02,411 --> 01:54:03,980
Oh shit.
And I just stop eating.

2427
01:54:04,550 --> 01:54:08,420
I just didn't eat for about four days.
Oh No.

2428
01:54:09,110 --> 01:54:11,120
Oh no,
that's so meanwhile,

2429
01:54:11,121 --> 01:54:13,740
eight pounds ain't shit.
I'll do that.

2430
01:54:14,060 --> 01:54:14,840
I'll do that.
Yeah.

2431
01:54:15,020 --> 01:54:17,030
The day before a crowd.
Oh,

2432
01:54:17,031 --> 01:54:17,840
we're good.
Yep,

2433
01:54:17,930 --> 01:54:21,320
exactly.
Still still eats one of the sauna.

2434
01:54:21,410 --> 01:54:22,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

2435
01:54:22,870 --> 01:54:27,200
And so I started myself for about four 
days and we check in your weight.

2436
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:28,850
Oystar and yourself?
Yeah,

2437
01:54:28,910 --> 01:54:30,360
I think it was.
I don't remember.

2438
01:54:30,370 --> 01:54:34,100
It's a long time ago,
but it was same day weigh ins to.

2439
01:54:34,220 --> 01:54:39,220
Oh Christ.
I waited in the morning and then fall 

2440
01:54:39,220 --> 01:54:42,240
about maybe eight or nine hours later.
Oh my God.

2441
01:54:43,100 --> 01:54:45,390
And uh,
I went five rounds with him.

2442
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:46,770
I went,
I,

2443
01:54:47,150 --> 01:54:48,980
I got,
I got my ass kicked,

2444
01:54:49,190 --> 01:54:50,340
I got my ass kicked.
But I,

2445
01:54:50,341 --> 01:54:54,880
I learned a lot and I grew from the 
experience out.

2446
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:58,340
Imagine Shit.
Any sours.

2447
01:54:58,341 --> 01:54:59,210
A legend.
Yeah.

2448
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:00,890
Yeah.
That is so crazy.

2449
01:55:00,891 --> 01:55:05,570
That was your first kickbox tk owed me 
with 17 seconds left to go.

2450
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:07,700
He shot,
he had chopped my legs down.

2451
01:55:07,701 --> 01:55:09,710
So to the point where I couldn't even 
stand,

2452
01:55:09,711 --> 01:55:11,720
I was falling through the ropes,
so it was all fucked.

2453
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:12,860
Wow.
Yeah,

2454
01:55:13,160 --> 01:55:13,730
it was awesome.

2455
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:17,780
It was cool shot.
I went back in,

2456
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:19,910
I came back to Albuquerque,
I went down,

2457
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:25,000
down to the gym and these guys had been 
kind of throwing me around up to that 

2458
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:28,091
point.
I specific specifically remember Diego 

2459
01:55:28,091 --> 01:55:28,130
Sanchez,
I mean at the time he's like king of the

2460
01:55:28,131 --> 01:55:33,131
case champions,
like the man in New Mexico managed 

2461
01:55:33,131 --> 01:55:33,500
Jackson's and you know,
he always gave me a,

2462
01:55:33,501 --> 01:55:34,090
you know,
really,

2463
01:55:34,091 --> 01:55:39,091
really,
really tough fight at are tough 

2464
01:55:39,091 --> 01:55:39,091
sparring,
sparring matches at that point.

2465
01:55:39,091 --> 01:55:40,760
And after I went through that 
experience,

2466
01:55:41,030 --> 01:55:43,320
it was just kinda like that.
You can't do shit me.

2467
01:55:43,600 --> 01:55:45,740
Wow.
Nothing just changed you.

2468
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:47,670
Yeah.
That's interesting.

2469
01:55:47,700 --> 01:55:48,390
That's amazing.
Well,

2470
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:52,050
what a fucking crazy matchup that is.
That's criminal.

2471
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:54,740
You should find out whoever matched you 
up and go beat their ass.

2472
01:55:55,150 --> 01:55:55,860
I know,
I know.

2473
01:55:55,861 --> 01:55:58,170
Who did it.
I'm glad I shake their hand.

2474
01:55:59,090 --> 01:56:01,380
That shaped me.
Well,

2475
01:56:01,381 --> 01:56:02,790
for you,
for a guy like you,

2476
01:56:02,820 --> 01:56:04,920
you can handle it,
but God damn that could have.

2477
01:56:05,070 --> 01:56:08,070
And I think they knew that this column 
syndrome.

2478
01:56:08,700 --> 01:56:09,950
Stockholm Syndrome,
right?

2479
01:56:11,060 --> 01:56:11,790
Yeah,
right.

2480
01:56:12,150 --> 01:56:17,150
Yeah.
Would be becoming friends through 

2481
01:56:17,150 --> 01:56:17,150
captors.
That's insane,

2482
01:56:17,150 --> 01:56:19,030
man.
What a crazy fucking match up.

2483
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:21,420
I've never seen.
I've never seen it.

2484
01:56:21,510 --> 01:56:23,760
I've never seen a video of it.
I think it's out there.

2485
01:56:23,820 --> 01:56:28,820
Wow.
I think even Andy Sour hit me up on one 

2486
01:56:28,820 --> 01:56:30,390
of the social media.
It's like asking if I had ever seen it.

2487
01:56:30,391 --> 01:56:31,050
I'm like,
no.

2488
01:56:31,210 --> 01:56:33,210
Bad.
Up to this point have not.

2489
01:56:33,390 --> 01:56:36,360
It was an undershoot boxing rules,
so shoot boxing,

2490
01:56:36,361 --> 01:56:41,361
I don't know if you're familiar,
was billed as no holds barred standup,

2491
01:56:42,491 --> 01:56:46,200
so it throws and take downs with 
kickboxing.

2492
01:56:46,250 --> 01:56:46,890
Oh,
okay.

2493
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:48,980
No.
Elbows like Draka.

2494
01:56:49,950 --> 01:56:54,950
Remember when they used to do that?
They were doing that in the United 

2495
01:56:54,950 --> 01:56:54,950
States for a while.
Was a kickbox and would take downs.

2496
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:56,870
I don't remember that,
but it.

2497
01:56:56,890 --> 01:56:58,770
That's,
that's what this was supposed to be.

2498
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:03,060
Maury Smith did that for a little bit 
and standing submissions was yeah,

2499
01:57:03,061 --> 01:57:08,061
you were supposed to be able to do 
standing submissions and I actually 

2500
01:57:08,061 --> 01:57:10,371
caught him in a few chokes standing and 
I think the rules were if the guy hits 

2501
01:57:11,221 --> 01:57:13,290
his knees,
he's.

2502
01:57:13,650 --> 01:57:15,760
They break it and they stop it.
Why?

2503
01:57:16,900 --> 01:57:18,000
I don't know.
It was weird.

2504
01:57:18,001 --> 01:57:18,500
It was.
It was.

2505
01:57:18,630 --> 01:57:19,410
It was cool,
man.

2506
01:57:19,411 --> 01:57:21,270
It was.
It was a good experience.

2507
01:57:21,271 --> 01:57:23,460
I was 19 years old.
I got to go to Japan.

2508
01:57:23,850 --> 01:57:26,010
Yeah.
Well fight for,

2509
01:57:26,120 --> 01:57:27,510
I don't know,
probably 500 bucks.

2510
01:57:27,511 --> 01:57:32,511
I don't even remember Japan's crazy.
Did you see rising sea rise in Japanese?

2511
01:57:35,851 --> 01:57:36,560
Um,
the,

2512
01:57:36,700 --> 01:57:41,280
the new year's show with fader.
I did not ask ultimate freak show.

2513
01:57:41,310 --> 01:57:42,240
Yeah,
it was awesome.

2514
01:57:42,270 --> 01:57:42,840
Cool.
Yeah,

2515
01:57:42,841 --> 01:57:47,841
it was almost like,
kind of like early days of pride where 

2516
01:57:47,841 --> 01:57:49,800
it was like Kinda chaotic.
Like Gabby Garcia was there.

2517
01:57:49,801 --> 01:57:51,300
Two hundred 20 pounds.

2518
01:57:51,660 --> 01:57:52,590
I saw that fight.
Yeah.

2519
01:57:52,620 --> 01:57:55,160
Choose to the fucking ear lobes.
She,

2520
01:57:56,340 --> 01:58:01,340
she got dropped right off the bat,
but she came back and she cracked the 

2521
01:58:01,340 --> 01:58:03,900
chick with a back fist fucking back 
faced coming back.

2522
01:58:03,901 --> 01:58:07,680
Man Arlovski with Travis Brown.
He landed a back fist.

2523
01:58:07,740 --> 01:58:08,340
Oh,
this one?

2524
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:09,830
Yeah,
a regular back.

2525
01:58:09,831 --> 01:58:12,750
It's not a spinning back fist.
A regular back fist just to pimp,

2526
01:58:12,751 --> 01:58:15,690
hand backhand.
Pan Pan.

2527
01:58:15,810 --> 01:58:18,540
But um,
it was two days of fights.

2528
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:19,620
Wow.
Yeah.

2529
01:58:19,630 --> 01:58:21,840
Sakuraba.
I might've been more than two days.

2530
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:25,410
Sakharova fought Aoki,
which was just criminal.

2531
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:27,460
They shouldn't let Sakharov a fight 
anymore.

2532
01:58:27,650 --> 01:58:28,900
It's just awful.
The wound.

2533
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:33,180
It's not how old he is,
it's the miles,

2534
01:58:33,210 --> 01:58:36,330
you know.
He's probably younger than Anderson.

2535
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:37,950
You know,
if I had a gas,

2536
01:58:38,030 --> 01:58:39,720
I would.
I would say he's younger than Anderson,

2537
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:45,080
but the beatings that guy's taken.
Did you see the Melvin manhoef fight 

2538
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:46,830
when Melvin was soccer kick him and he 
was down.

2539
01:58:47,580 --> 01:58:52,580
It was so hard to watch those vandelay 
knockouts that he suffered.

2540
01:58:52,990 --> 01:58:57,990
Those are brutal.
Ruthless in that guy has been through 

2541
01:58:57,990 --> 01:58:57,990
the ringer.
You know,

2542
01:58:57,990 --> 01:58:58,500
he's,
he's so corrupt.

2543
01:58:58,510 --> 01:59:00,340
What a legend.
Now that guy is what?

2544
01:59:00,341 --> 01:59:01,450
A legend.
Absolutely.

2545
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:04,840
I remember the first time I saw pride,
I saw him fighting hoists gracie.

2546
01:59:05,410 --> 01:59:08,520
Wow.
That was that 90 minute fire.

2547
01:59:08,530 --> 01:59:11,410
Was that 90 minute one and had he had 
hoists in that,

2548
01:59:11,700 --> 01:59:16,700
that like dead to rights,
newborn hoists would not tap what ended 

2549
01:59:16,901 --> 01:59:18,880
up happening?
I was at a decision.

2550
01:59:18,881 --> 01:59:20,770
Yeah.
Well it was a draw because they want the

2551
01:59:20,771 --> 01:59:22,600
90 minutes and nothing happened.
Yeah,

2552
01:59:22,990 --> 01:59:25,810
I think it was a draw.
I think that that's how they say no,

2553
01:59:25,811 --> 01:59:26,380
no,
no,

2554
01:59:26,381 --> 01:59:27,040
no,
no.

2555
01:59:27,270 --> 01:59:29,440
Hoists broke his ankle.
That's right.

2556
01:59:29,740 --> 01:59:31,600
Didn't he break his ankle and he 
couldn't continue?

2557
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:34,060
Fuck.
Why do I not remember that,

2558
01:59:34,270 --> 01:59:34,570
Jamie?

2559
01:59:34,570 --> 01:59:35,580
I'll pull it up.
He'll find out.

2560
01:59:35,610 --> 01:59:36,090
All right,
cool.

2561
01:59:36,120 --> 01:59:38,980
There was two fights.
They had another one in k one,

2562
01:59:39,310 --> 01:59:42,190
and that was in America.
I was there live for that one,

2563
01:59:42,191 --> 01:59:45,100
and Noyce was juiced up.
Pig was yoked up.

2564
01:59:45,101 --> 01:59:48,470
Then he tested positive and they find 
him a fuck load of money.

2565
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:50,180
Don't know if favorite ever paid it,
but he patched,

2566
01:59:50,740 --> 01:59:52,030
but now he's back.
He's fighting,

2567
01:59:52,090 --> 01:59:53,890
which is crazy.
He's fighting Ken shamrock.

2568
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:56,720
I saw that on a on tour.
Yeah,

2569
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:59,020
it's the main event in February.
That's crazy.

2570
01:59:59,080 --> 02:00:01,060
Yeah.
It's so strange.

2571
02:00:01,480 --> 02:00:06,480
Yeah.
I remember their fight was the first 

2572
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:07,330
fight ever,
so it was first UFC fight.

2573
02:00:07,331 --> 02:00:09,710
I had ever seen Sakharova and hoists.
No,

2574
02:00:09,711 --> 02:00:10,450
no,
no.

2575
02:00:10,510 --> 02:00:15,510
Ten in Canada.
Canada hoists and voice was choking the 

2576
02:00:15,510 --> 02:00:16,240
choke.
Choked him with his ski.

2577
02:00:16,310 --> 02:00:17,770
Yeah.
It was wild,

2578
02:00:17,771 --> 02:00:19,510
man.
That was the early days.

2579
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:24,520
Men.
The first fight I ever saw was Orlando 

2580
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:27,151
veit versus rem co pardot when Graham 
called pardue took him down and elbowed 

2581
02:00:28,561 --> 02:00:33,561
the fuck out of him and from side 
control or you had them like that and I 

2582
02:00:34,331 --> 02:00:36,300
remember watching that going,
oh Geez,

2583
02:00:36,330 --> 02:00:37,650
a Christ.

2584
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:39,700
What kind of fucking crazy sport is 
this?

2585
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:42,910
The pardot Guy Kinda hits him a few 
times.

2586
02:00:42,940 --> 02:00:47,940
Then it kind of implies that he's 
knocked out and you kind of just let 

2587
02:00:47,940 --> 02:00:49,660
them go at the time.
Would just let them mainly.

2588
02:00:49,670 --> 02:00:50,280
Yeah.
Oh,

2589
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:53,180
big John Big John was one of the reps 
back then.

2590
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:55,000
Crazy.
You remember when?

2591
02:00:55,001 --> 02:00:56,220
Um,
uh,

2592
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:59,230
what the fuck is his name?
Fought that Ninja dude.

2593
02:00:59,231 --> 02:01:04,231
Pat Pat Smith.
Pat Smith's fought some dude who was 

2594
02:01:04,231 --> 02:01:05,020
like doing,
like they had his,

2595
02:01:05,290 --> 02:01:10,290
his pre-fight video and it's preflight 
videos doing like Ninja techniques and 

2596
02:01:10,290 --> 02:01:12,700
like fucking all this crazy shit that 
doesn't really work.

2597
02:01:13,030 --> 02:01:18,030
And then he got in there with Pat Smith 
who was a pretty seasoned kickboxer 

2598
02:01:18,030 --> 02:01:18,030
yeah.
And it was dropping.

2599
02:01:18,030 --> 02:01:22,720
Just wicked elbows on him from the mount
and knocked him out and then woke him up

2600
02:01:22,780 --> 02:01:25,210
and then knocked him out again before 
the ref stopped.

2601
02:01:25,211 --> 02:01:30,211
Yeah,
well he got up and was just a bath of 

2602
02:01:30,211 --> 02:01:32,521
blood.
His whole head was essentially opened 

2603
02:01:32,521 --> 02:01:32,530
up,
but that was the early days.

2604
02:01:32,531 --> 02:01:37,531
Man.
The early days were really fascinating 

2605
02:01:37,531 --> 02:01:40,261
because you,
you were around martial arts before the 

2606
02:01:40,261 --> 02:01:40,261
USC,

2607
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:42,850
so you had seen like,
you know,

2608
02:01:42,860 --> 02:01:47,860
you'd seen karate and you'd seen all 
these different judo and all this 

2609
02:01:47,860 --> 02:01:48,740
different stuff and nobody really knew 
what the best stuff was.

2610
02:01:49,340 --> 02:01:51,500
I always knew that wrestlers could take 
it down.

2611
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:56,560
I always knew that was gonna be a 
problem because I wrestled in high 

2612
02:01:56,560 --> 02:01:58,931
school and I had a good buddy of mine,
my friend Steven Arduino when I was 

2613
02:01:58,931 --> 02:02:02,471
doing taekwondo and he was wrestling.
One of the reasons why I got into 

2614
02:02:02,471 --> 02:02:05,621
wrestling because I didn't think that he
could take me down out in the grass.

2615
02:02:05,631 --> 02:02:07,010
He was like,
I can take you down anytime I want.

2616
02:02:07,011 --> 02:02:08,030
I'm like,
Bull Shit.

2617
02:02:08,450 --> 02:02:10,430
He took me down over and over again.
I was like,

2618
02:02:10,431 --> 02:02:12,650
this is crazy.
It was so humiliating,

2619
02:02:12,830 --> 02:02:15,380
like he was just,
he just took me down every time you want

2620
02:02:15,381 --> 02:02:15,890
it to,
and I was like,

2621
02:02:15,891 --> 02:02:16,540
this is Matt.

2622
02:02:16,550 --> 02:02:18,770
I got to start wrestling.
So I started wrestling.

2623
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:23,800
That's one of the reasons why I started.
Another one dude got me in a headlock 

2624
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:23,800
and fucking threw me down in the locker 
room.

2625
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:28,740
Could have beat me up,
but didn't know it was like God dammit 

2626
02:02:28,740 --> 02:02:29,420
Braille.
So I had to learn wrestling,

2627
02:02:29,421 --> 02:02:32,720
but I always knew that wrestlers could 
take you down if they wanted to,

2628
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:36,830
but I always felt like a guy who knew a 
little bit of wrestling,

2629
02:02:36,831 --> 02:02:39,830
it was a good kickboxer would probably 
be able to keep the fight standing,

2630
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:42,260
but then when he started choking people,
I was like,

2631
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:44,300
oh no,
it's a whole different thing.

2632
02:02:44,301 --> 02:02:49,301
This is a completely different thing.
That guy beat that guy from his back 

2633
02:02:49,301 --> 02:02:51,440
with a fuck winds on their back.
Like it was just a whole new element.

2634
02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:57,480
You know?
It's interesting because you've been 

2635
02:02:57,480 --> 02:02:59,351
around from the WEC days,
which were when you were the wec champ,

2636
02:03:00,020 --> 02:03:01,130
like it was.

2637
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:06,760
It was so small in comparison to what it
is now for you to go from that to that 

2638
02:03:07,611 --> 02:03:12,611
last fight against Robbie in Vegas,
which was just this massive fucking 

2639
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:16,730
media event.
You're fighting for the world title.

2640
02:03:16,731 --> 02:03:18,920
You get there,
the place is sold out.

2641
02:03:18,921 --> 02:03:21,740
It's craziness.
The roar of the crowd,

2642
02:03:22,010 --> 02:03:27,010
you know,
time and like what a fucking odyssey 

2643
02:03:27,010 --> 02:03:29,220
you've been through and your career 
because you,

2644
02:03:29,221 --> 02:03:33,230
you were there sort of when it was kind 
of just starting to take off.

2645
02:03:33,350 --> 02:03:33,900
Yeah.
Yeah.

2646
02:03:33,910 --> 02:03:37,150
I really got in on the ground level.
Yeah.

2647
02:03:37,870 --> 02:03:40,130
Even before Wec,
I told you we were fighting.

2648
02:03:40,131 --> 02:03:45,131
It's like 200,
300 person venues in the middle of the 

2649
02:03:45,131 --> 02:03:46,190
desert and it's been crazy,
man.

2650
02:03:46,310 --> 02:03:51,310
It's been a.
it's been an incredible ride and it has 

2651
02:03:51,381 --> 02:03:55,520
been the coolest fucking thing ever I 
want to do as a young kid.

2652
02:03:55,820 --> 02:04:00,820
None of this existed and,
but I was into the early nineties 

2653
02:04:00,820 --> 02:04:04,410
martial arts movies and Ninja turtles 
and I wanted to be,

2654
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:06,450
wanted to be a Ninja.
I,

2655
02:04:06,470 --> 02:04:08,830
that's what I wanted to do.
I remember my mom,

2656
02:04:08,860 --> 02:04:13,860
that was the second movie that I had 
ever seen was the first Ninja turtles 

2657
02:04:13,860 --> 02:04:16,631
movie and I came out of there,
what should fucking kicks and spinning 

2658
02:04:17,031 --> 02:04:18,620
shit and,
and,

2659
02:04:18,621 --> 02:04:19,720
uh,
every,

2660
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:24,760
you know,
from then on I was training to be 

2661
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:27,431
something and just so happened I lived 
in a time that this came to be and lived

2662
02:04:29,811 --> 02:04:32,930
in a city where there was this camp that
was,

2663
02:04:33,310 --> 02:04:34,520
you know,
by,

2664
02:04:34,550 --> 02:04:37,100
you know,
kind of inexplicably good,

2665
02:04:37,340 --> 02:04:38,160
um,
for

2666
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:43,160
a small podunk place like albuquerque,
but not just an exclude explicably good 

2667
02:04:44,581 --> 02:04:46,110
for the,
what it was,

2668
02:04:46,440 --> 02:04:49,410
but also for the time.
And it evolved,

2669
02:04:49,590 --> 02:04:51,990
whereas a lot of those camps that were 
big back then,

2670
02:04:51,991 --> 02:04:53,910
like the lion's den,
they're gone.

2671
02:04:54,180 --> 02:04:56,400
You know,
the Pat Miletich is Jim.

2672
02:04:56,490 --> 02:05:01,490
It's gone like these,
these gyms that were really big at the 

2673
02:05:01,490 --> 02:05:05,181
time,
they didn't evolve or they didn't carry 

2674
02:05:05,181 --> 02:05:05,181
on or for whatever reason,
they stopped doing it.

2675
02:05:05,181 --> 02:05:05,910
You know,
your,

2676
02:05:05,911 --> 02:05:10,911
your gym is not just evolved but evolved
to be one of the premier gyms in the 

2677
02:05:10,911 --> 02:05:12,960
world.
It's really kind of incredible.

2678
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:15,030
Yeah.
And there's been a lot of change,

2679
02:05:15,060 --> 02:05:15,750
you know,
somebody,

2680
02:05:15,770 --> 02:05:20,770
a law,
like a lot of the original guys have 

2681
02:05:20,770 --> 02:05:20,770
branched off and are kind of doing their
own thing.

2682
02:05:20,770 --> 02:05:21,720
But um,
yeah,

2683
02:05:21,721 --> 02:05:22,920
the,
the,

2684
02:05:23,570 --> 02:05:28,290
the genesis of MMA in Albuquerque is 
kind of an interesting story.

2685
02:05:28,490 --> 02:05:29,290
Um,
and,

2686
02:05:29,640 --> 02:05:31,290
and I don't,
I wasn't there,

2687
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:33,120
I was like,
told this,

2688
02:05:33,121 --> 02:05:33,570
I was,
you know,

2689
02:05:33,590 --> 02:05:35,280
this is kind of,
you know,

2690
02:05:35,310 --> 02:05:40,310
firsthand hearsay from the people who,
who did develop this thing is that 

2691
02:05:40,310 --> 02:05:44,840
basically these guys from these 
different disciplines got together and 

2692
02:05:44,840 --> 02:05:46,260
they had watched the UFC and wanted to,
oh,

2693
02:05:46,770 --> 02:05:49,470
I have a wrestling background.
This guy has a chemical background.

2694
02:05:49,471 --> 02:05:50,820
This guy is like a,
you know,

2695
02:05:50,930 --> 02:05:55,930
a Akka karate kinda background,
whatever.

2696
02:05:56,370 --> 02:06:00,330
They all got together and they started 
formulating the shit in this one guy was

2697
02:06:00,331 --> 02:06:04,440
a flight attendant and he was flying all
over the country.

2698
02:06:04,590 --> 02:06:06,270
And every,
everywhere he'd stop,

2699
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:11,960
he would,
he would go to these different schools 

2700
02:06:11,960 --> 02:06:11,960
because there wasn't the internet at the
time.

2701
02:06:12,130 --> 02:06:14,550
You couldn't jump on youtube and look at
techniques.

2702
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:19,960
So he would go,
the guy's name's Chris Luttrell and he 

2703
02:06:19,960 --> 02:06:21,380
cornered me for my fight against GSP,
uh,

2704
02:06:21,940 --> 02:06:24,210
and what is one of the founding members 
of Jackson's.

2705
02:06:24,390 --> 02:06:29,390
He was going to these different Jiu 
Jitsu judo pankration schools and see 

2706
02:06:30,210 --> 02:06:35,210
what they were doing that he was 
bringing the information back and they 

2707
02:06:35,210 --> 02:06:35,210
were.
And then they were,

2708
02:06:35,210 --> 02:06:39,590
you know,
Kinda getting into the laboratory and 

2709
02:06:39,590 --> 02:06:39,590
see what was working.
At the same time.

2710
02:06:39,590 --> 02:06:42,930
Some of these guys were bouncers and 
police officers and,

2711
02:06:43,330 --> 02:06:48,330
and,
and literally using this stuff on the 

2712
02:06:48,330 --> 02:06:48,330
street in some,
you know,

2713
02:06:48,330 --> 02:06:51,900
some had roadhouse type fucking 
situations.

2714
02:06:53,250 --> 02:06:54,290
That's awesome.
Read.

2715
02:06:54,660 --> 02:06:59,660
My original trainer was like a Patrick 
swayze from roadhouse type kinda guide.

2716
02:07:00,150 --> 02:07:02,190
Tom Vaughn,
I don't know if you know Tom von.

2717
02:07:02,210 --> 02:07:03,810
Yeah,
he means yes.

2718
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:08,160
And his NHP now in albuquerque as well.
And he was,

2719
02:07:08,190 --> 02:07:10,390
him and Greg were,
I mean that,

2720
02:07:10,391 --> 02:07:12,540
that he's one of the founding members as
well.

2721
02:07:12,630 --> 02:07:17,630
It's kind of crazy that there's two big 
gyms like that in a place as small as 

2722
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:21,060
albuquerque that have UFC fighters while
they split their.

2723
02:07:21,090 --> 02:07:22,800
Yeah,
they're from the same place.

2724
02:07:22,801 --> 02:07:25,580
They they branched off at one point,
but they split up.

2725
02:07:25,680 --> 02:07:30,680
It's crazy that these both guys have 
developed really high level talent 

2726
02:07:31,460 --> 02:07:34,530
because they all came from the same,
the same original.

2727
02:07:35,140 --> 02:07:36,040
Think.
That's

2728
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:38,500
a fascinating story about the flight 
attendant.

2729
02:07:38,530 --> 02:07:39,490
I'm sorry,
what's the name again?

2730
02:07:39,610 --> 02:07:44,610
Chris Luttrell.
Cristal trial [inaudible] him traveling 

2731
02:07:44,610 --> 02:07:45,730
and doing that.
That's similar to what Halas Gracie did.

2732
02:07:45,740 --> 02:07:49,570
Whole holes did holes.
Gracie traveled to America and learned a

2733
02:07:49,571 --> 02:07:52,270
lot of wrestling shit and learn catch 
wrestling stuff.

2734
02:07:52,271 --> 02:07:55,410
That's why the Americana is named the 
Americana.

2735
02:07:55,450 --> 02:07:56,180
It's uh,
it's uh,

2736
02:07:56,460 --> 02:08:01,460
you know,
it really came from American catch 

2737
02:08:01,460 --> 02:08:03,391
wrestling and they started incorporating
into Brazilian jujitsu along with some 

2738
02:08:03,391 --> 02:08:05,680
wrestling techniques and some sambo.
And he learned a bunch of Shit.

2739
02:08:05,860 --> 02:08:08,590
And he was the guy that really was 
Hickson's mentor.

2740
02:08:08,620 --> 02:08:11,920
He was the guy that was the head of the 
family before he died.

2741
02:08:11,950 --> 02:08:15,730
He was the man and he died in a hang 
gliding accident and Rio.

2742
02:08:16,060 --> 02:08:17,560
Yeah.
And he was the,

2743
02:08:17,561 --> 02:08:20,110
he was the guy,
like he was the head of the,

2744
02:08:20,500 --> 02:08:21,430
all the others,
you know,

2745
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:24,210
he was the one alpha of all the,
uh,

2746
02:08:24,211 --> 02:08:25,270
the grapplers.
And he,

2747
02:08:25,390 --> 02:08:29,470
he was dedicated to learning and 
incorporating different techniques,

2748
02:08:29,900 --> 02:08:34,900
I think,
like in any other context of those were 

2749
02:08:34,900 --> 02:08:38,460
the most adaptable and most open to 
change and evolution or those who 

2750
02:08:38,460 --> 02:08:40,150
survive looked for a remember Eddie 
Bravo,

2751
02:08:40,290 --> 02:08:41,830
uh,
showing uh,

2752
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:44,860
he,
he's approach to and Resi Hixon Gracie.

2753
02:08:45,340 --> 02:08:50,020
And why is it so hard?
Why is it hard on me?

2754
02:08:52,660 --> 02:08:55,990
And he was,
despite his,

2755
02:08:56,020 --> 02:09:00,670
he's amazing knowledge and background 
and achievements.

2756
02:09:00,700 --> 02:09:05,700
He was open enough to listen carefully,
respectfully with Vienna,

2757
02:09:07,211 --> 02:09:12,211
with humility.
But you even asked questions like 

2758
02:09:12,211 --> 02:09:14,401
Hickson was asking questions about 
different aspects of the positions and 

2759
02:09:14,401 --> 02:09:14,401
coming from the,
the,

2760
02:09:14,401 --> 02:09:15,320
the Bjj world.
That's,

2761
02:09:15,390 --> 02:09:18,580
that's unusual actually will hixon is a 
very unusual guy.

2762
02:09:18,581 --> 02:09:21,760
Hickson was a Yogi,
like he was the first guy to incorporate

2763
02:09:21,761 --> 02:09:26,761
yoga and he is a legit Yogi,
like have you ever seen the videos of 

2764
02:09:26,761 --> 02:09:31,261
him doing those exercises in Santa 
Monica where he's balancing on one leg 

2765
02:09:31,261 --> 02:09:35,761
and he puts his leg up and a full split 
is incredible control of his body and 

2766
02:09:36,070 --> 02:09:37,600
enhance the,
the people,

2767
02:09:37,601 --> 02:09:38,860
uh,
uh,

2768
02:09:39,370 --> 02:09:41,950
legitimately,
legitimately saying,

2769
02:09:42,130 --> 02:09:47,130
hey,
rickson was the first to implement 

2770
02:09:47,130 --> 02:09:47,920
movement spreading.
He was,

2771
02:09:47,921 --> 02:09:48,690
yeah,
he was,

2772
02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:51,730
but here's the thing to me,
uh,

2773
02:09:51,820 --> 02:09:56,520
I want to pay tribute to all coaches 
that they are Moitai,

2774
02:09:56,540 --> 02:09:58,120
tighe,
striking coaches,

2775
02:09:58,121 --> 02:10:01,540
Judah coaches,
even strength and conditioning coaches.

2776
02:10:01,710 --> 02:10:05,190
They all,
all movement trainers and movements,

2777
02:10:05,191 --> 02:10:10,191
fishers,
they all are well more or less 

2778
02:10:10,191 --> 02:10:10,191
specialized,
but they are.

2779
02:10:10,191 --> 02:10:10,450
It's a movement.
It is.

2780
02:10:10,451 --> 02:10:15,451
And you know,
there's an interesting aspect that's 

2781
02:10:15,451 --> 02:10:15,850
going on right now in 10th planet 
Jujitsu with break dancers.

2782
02:10:16,330 --> 02:10:21,280
There's a bunch of these guys like 
Richard Martinez who was a break dancer,

2783
02:10:21,281 --> 02:10:24,040
like amazing breakdancer and his brother
Geo.

2784
02:10:24,190 --> 02:10:27,400
These guys,
they can do crazy shit with their body.

2785
02:10:27,580 --> 02:10:32,580
They standing on one hand and spinning 
around and because of that you have 

2786
02:10:32,580 --> 02:10:34,790
another term hip hop a lot about how you
control your hips,

2787
02:10:34,791 --> 02:10:37,220
which is the fundamental of Jujitsu.
It's,

2788
02:10:37,221 --> 02:10:40,610
I don't think that's where like because 
it rhymed,

2789
02:10:41,120 --> 02:10:42,680
it came from,
it came from like,

2790
02:10:42,730 --> 02:10:46,930
I'm hip hop dance,
different sugarhill bent hip hop,

2791
02:10:47,630 --> 02:10:50,780
hip hop.
What'd you guys had?

2792
02:10:50,781 --> 02:10:53,060
Incredible movement.
They didn't show it much.

2793
02:10:54,030 --> 02:10:59,030
They had to to.
They're the rhymes over shadowed their 

2794
02:10:59,030 --> 02:10:59,690
fucking stability,
their courses.

2795
02:11:00,860 --> 02:11:04,500
There's the dance and then there's the 
music and then there is in Breck Denson.

2796
02:11:04,501 --> 02:11:09,501
You're going to use these guys.
You're going to use your hips a like 

2797
02:11:09,501 --> 02:11:09,501
crazy.
I'll.

2798
02:11:09,501 --> 02:11:11,930
His movements are achieved because you 
have great hip control.

2799
02:11:12,110 --> 02:11:14,910
Look at Ninja Jitsu.
He must have this drip country.

2800
02:11:14,911 --> 02:11:16,850
Look at this control.
Play that from the beginning.

2801
02:11:16,851 --> 02:11:21,851
Jamie,
watch with this guy can do this is just 

2802
02:11:21,851 --> 02:11:25,361
one of the breakdown.
Look at he's standing on his fucking 

2803
02:11:25,361 --> 02:11:27,320
head justice said,
but trying roles.

2804
02:11:27,340 --> 02:11:29,150
Yeah.
All sorts of stuff.

2805
02:11:29,151 --> 02:11:31,160
Absolutely.
Well these guys,

2806
02:11:31,220 --> 02:11:33,680
um,
when Eddie first started training them,

2807
02:11:33,681 --> 02:11:38,681
enrolling with them,
he was amazed at how freakishly strong 

2808
02:11:38,681 --> 02:11:39,560
they were and you know,
you look at them,

2809
02:11:39,561 --> 02:11:44,561
they look like regular people,
but it's the physical control of their 

2810
02:11:44,561 --> 02:11:46,900
body is just spectacular because of,
you know,

2811
02:11:46,950 --> 02:11:49,850
it's essentially similar to gymnastics 
and a lot of ways like,

2812
02:11:49,851 --> 02:11:53,090
look at this fucking ego level.

2813
02:11:53,120 --> 02:11:56,780
Oh my God.
And walking on his hands.

2814
02:11:58,070 --> 02:11:59,480
This is nuts,
man.

2815
02:12:00,440 --> 02:12:03,110
That is fucking nuts.
What's the name of this video,

2816
02:12:03,111 --> 02:12:08,111
Jamie?
So people are listening to like watch 

2817
02:12:08,111 --> 02:12:08,111
this 10th planet break dance crew freak 
show.

2818
02:12:08,111 --> 02:12:09,620
Yeah,
they all call themselves freak show.

2819
02:12:09,621 --> 02:12:14,621
He's got a,
he owns 10th planet San Diego trying to 

2820
02:12:14,621 --> 02:12:15,060
submit himself.
Uh,

2821
02:12:15,860 --> 02:12:16,940
yeah,
you can submit himself.

2822
02:12:16,980 --> 02:12:19,160
There's a couple of kids that can put 
themselves in triangles,

2823
02:12:19,161 --> 02:12:20,780
like legitimately put themselves in 
trials.

2824
02:12:20,781 --> 02:12:25,010
So we get this fucking shit.
I'm sassing but admire at the same time.

2825
02:12:25,011 --> 02:12:25,880
This Kale.
It's,

2826
02:12:25,881 --> 02:12:26,840
there's no doubt.
Oh,

2827
02:12:26,870 --> 02:12:30,470
there's no doubt of the physical control
of the body is just spectacular.

2828
02:12:30,680 --> 02:12:32,420
And this is the first time I've seen 
this,

2829
02:12:32,421 --> 02:12:36,100
but I mean I can see that the 
application to combat sport.

2830
02:12:36,260 --> 02:12:39,440
Yeah.
Immediately I've rolled with a couple of

2831
02:12:39,441 --> 02:12:41,090
these guys.
They're fucking freaks.

2832
02:12:41,160 --> 02:12:42,140
I can't hold onto them.

2833
02:12:42,580 --> 02:12:47,580
Yeah.
They move all over the place and they 

2834
02:12:47,580 --> 02:12:49,751
can catch you in shit from all sorts of 
weird angles like look at that and he's 

2835
02:12:49,751 --> 02:12:53,680
on one hand that he puts his legs and 
full logus standing on one hand jumping 

2836
02:12:53,680 --> 02:12:57,870
up and down.
Tenth Planet Jiu Jitsu is a very,

2837
02:12:57,871 --> 02:13:00,570
uh,
explorative innovative school of,

2838
02:13:00,890 --> 02:13:03,410
of Jujitsu and um,
in,

2839
02:13:03,411 --> 02:13:05,390
in the,
in the game of MMA,

2840
02:13:05,391 --> 02:13:08,690
of those gyms who also are open and 
collaborative,

2841
02:13:08,990 --> 02:13:11,450
arguing to kid themselves.
You know,

2842
02:13:11,451 --> 02:13:14,360
at the upper echelon,
um,

2843
02:13:14,420 --> 02:13:18,230
and those who don't evolve will,
will disappear because it isn't till the

2844
02:13:18,240 --> 02:13:19,680
methods,
the,

2845
02:13:19,740 --> 02:13:22,760
the end result is the same.
It's the fight it's fighting,

2846
02:13:22,761 --> 02:13:26,850
but the methods to get there and to be 
proficient at it,

2847
02:13:27,190 --> 02:13:32,190
it's,
it boils down to the methods that you 

2848
02:13:32,190 --> 02:13:32,260
use.
And uh,

2849
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:35,180
with uh,
with Carlos there was a,

2850
02:13:35,250 --> 02:13:40,250
there was no resistance when I 
approached him and start to try and he 

2851
02:13:40,250 --> 02:13:43,970
talk to his coaches about it and they,
they may not understand right away 

2852
02:13:43,970 --> 02:13:44,090
exactly what it was about.
Well,

2853
02:13:44,091 --> 02:13:49,091
what was going to bring to his game,
but they were at least open to it and 

2854
02:13:49,321 --> 02:13:53,400
eventually this saw a what together 
we've been able to,

2855
02:13:53,580 --> 02:13:56,250
to improve and achieve.
And if,

2856
02:13:56,280 --> 02:13:59,790
if,
if it didn't have that attitude,

2857
02:14:00,270 --> 02:14:05,270
then Carlos would have not benefited you
contact a Jackson and Gregg and 

2858
02:14:06,510 --> 02:14:11,220
winkeljohn before you worked with her 
one or did you try it out first and go,

2859
02:14:11,221 --> 02:14:11,810
Hey,
uh,

2860
02:14:11,811 --> 02:14:13,890
I think I'm onto something.
Um,

2861
02:14:14,910 --> 02:14:16,020
I think,
I don't know,

2862
02:14:16,050 --> 02:14:17,640
I don't,
I don't remember how that worked,

2863
02:14:17,641 --> 02:14:20,910
but it was really interesting in Erwin 
touched on it earlier,

2864
02:14:20,911 --> 02:14:24,170
was that they saw the same thing.
They both watch it.

2865
02:14:24,450 --> 02:14:27,620
So after my widening the stance,
yeah.

2866
02:14:27,660 --> 02:14:28,510
And,
and the,

2867
02:14:28,511 --> 02:14:31,150
the ability to move forward and back we 
me and uh,

2868
02:14:31,710 --> 02:14:36,710
and uh,
Greg Jackson sat and he wanted to watch 

2869
02:14:36,710 --> 02:14:37,170
a couple of my fights and we want to see
what we're doing well and what we needed

2870
02:14:37,171 --> 02:14:42,171
improvement on a few things and I 
started work with Erwin completely 

2871
02:14:43,831 --> 02:14:46,950
independently and you know,
we're walking on logs and this and that.

2872
02:14:46,951 --> 02:14:47,850
And he's like,
well,

2873
02:14:47,851 --> 02:14:51,140
this is kind of a plan that I have for 
you and this is what I see.

2874
02:14:51,141 --> 02:14:54,000
And it was exactly the same thing that 
Greg Jackson,

2875
02:14:54,001 --> 02:14:58,440
who is considered to be one of the most 
brilliant minds in mma saw.

2876
02:14:58,650 --> 02:15:03,650
I'm Erwin,
is a movement specialist in Irwin had a 

2877
02:15:03,650 --> 02:15:04,890
plan and a strategy on how to improve 
that.

2878
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:10,280
Um,
what was Jackson's idea of dealing with 

2879
02:15:10,280 --> 02:15:10,280
it?
What did he think?

2880
02:15:10,280 --> 02:15:11,370
He knew what needed to be done.

2881
02:15:11,380 --> 02:15:13,350
I don't think he necessarily knew how to
get there.

2882
02:15:13,530 --> 02:15:17,040
So he knew that you needed to be able to
move in and out better?

2883
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:19,270
Yes,
but he didn't have any strategy.

2884
02:15:19,770 --> 02:15:21,530
I wouldn't say that he didn't have any 
strategy.

2885
02:15:21,531 --> 02:15:22,470
It was kind of,
okay,

2886
02:15:22,471 --> 02:15:23,610
you know,
we'll work on that.

2887
02:15:23,640 --> 02:15:25,060
Let's figure out how.
Let's,

2888
02:15:25,220 --> 02:15:27,210
let's work on that.
But I'd be just drill it.

2889
02:15:27,860 --> 02:15:28,530
Yeah,
exactly.

2890
02:15:28,590 --> 02:15:31,740
Drilling a Irwin and I,
we,

2891
02:15:32,130 --> 02:15:36,060
we videotaped my,
we videotaped us moving across the same,

2892
02:15:36,090 --> 02:15:38,850
the same distance and the students fast 
man,

2893
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:41,730
he's like a fucking deer.
He moves really,

2894
02:15:41,731 --> 02:15:42,750
really,
really quickly.

2895
02:15:42,810 --> 02:15:43,980
He can run,
he can,

2896
02:15:44,890 --> 02:15:47,700
he does.
He's got that look into that fund myself

2897
02:15:47,701 --> 02:15:52,701
and the color of the wood with me being 
a so called deer and these guy with his 

2898
02:15:52,701 --> 02:15:54,430
boat because he shoots like super sharp.
Uh,

2899
02:15:55,590 --> 02:15:56,490
so,
uh,

2900
02:15:57,780 --> 02:16:00,420
so videos you're going back and forth 
and so we're,

2901
02:16:00,421 --> 02:16:02,330
you know,
we're looking at and we're,

2902
02:16:02,480 --> 02:16:07,480
we're,
we're looking at this stuff in slow mo 

2903
02:16:07,480 --> 02:16:09,621
frame by frame where his body position 
is compared to where mine is and what's 

2904
02:16:09,621 --> 02:16:09,621
the difference.

2905
02:16:09,621 --> 02:16:12,330
He's moving faster because boom,
he's more upright.

2906
02:16:12,331 --> 02:16:17,331
He doesn't have so much weight on his 
front foot that he asked to load and 

2907
02:16:17,331 --> 02:16:21,210
take another half second before he just,
he springs backwards.

2908
02:16:21,211 --> 02:16:22,590
Right?
And so we're like,

2909
02:16:22,591 --> 02:16:23,400
boom,
that's it.

2910
02:16:24,450 --> 02:16:26,580
This is what,
this is what we need to improve on,

2911
02:16:26,640 --> 02:16:30,290
this is what we need to do.
Now we're going drill it and,

2912
02:16:30,300 --> 02:16:33,860
and there's a variety of different 
things to kind of in a,

2913
02:16:33,970 --> 02:16:35,110
you know,
it's still that,

2914
02:16:35,180 --> 02:16:40,180
that a stance in the posture as a,
on a neuromuscular level.

2915
02:16:40,840 --> 02:16:42,670
Are you having other fighters 
approaching now?

2916
02:16:43,810 --> 02:16:47,920
Not yet,
but really I saw that video.

2917
02:16:47,921 --> 02:16:50,320
I would imagine the video.
Have you guys trained together?

2918
02:16:51,940 --> 02:16:56,940
There is still some,
probably some skepticism can have West 

2919
02:16:56,940 --> 02:17:00,490
this Moltmann coaching and lucky and it 
looks like it doesn't have.

2920
02:17:00,700 --> 02:17:04,960
It doesn't look like Jesus doesn't have 
a man bun and Isu have foreign accent.

2921
02:17:05,020 --> 02:17:06,010
It's a ripoff.

2922
02:17:09,560 --> 02:17:10,220
Right?
So,

2923
02:17:10,230 --> 02:17:15,230
um,
I think that they don't know exactly 

2924
02:17:15,230 --> 02:17:19,411
what it is about the end.
They probably believe that it's either 

2925
02:17:19,411 --> 02:17:22,810
rent a random or.
But if you listen to what Carla says,

2926
02:17:23,010 --> 02:17:24,670
um,
it is actually,

2927
02:17:24,671 --> 02:17:28,000
it was highly specific because a can't 
be three months,

2928
02:17:28,050 --> 02:17:32,200
we would train once a week,
maybe sometimes twice a week,

2929
02:17:32,201 --> 02:17:35,860
but that's still a limit on amount of 
time to make those changes happen.

2930
02:17:35,861 --> 02:17:38,820
So I had to choose my battle and then I,
I,

2931
02:17:39,220 --> 02:17:39,940
I,
I,

2932
02:17:40,330 --> 02:17:41,530
I told Carlos,
listen,

2933
02:17:41,531 --> 02:17:44,020
this is what I believe we need to work 
on and just focus on.

2934
02:17:44,340 --> 02:17:49,340
And we did that for the first camp and 
then the second camp for a loader was 

2935
02:17:49,340 --> 02:17:50,980
completely different,
completely different,

2936
02:17:51,730 --> 02:17:52,340
uh,
and,

2937
02:17:52,350 --> 02:17:54,060
and highly specific to,
uh,

2938
02:17:54,410 --> 02:17:55,190
improving,
uh,

2939
02:17:55,270 --> 02:18:00,270
kicking.
What were you gonna say you're going to 

2940
02:18:00,270 --> 02:18:00,270
say we actually,
we do have some guys that are,

2941
02:18:00,550 --> 02:18:02,710
they've been doing this kind of 
independently.

2942
02:18:02,710 --> 02:18:03,820
They,
one of the,

2943
02:18:03,850 --> 02:18:04,960
one of the guys,
young guy,

2944
02:18:04,990 --> 02:18:07,720
and they're fighting on like amateur and
regional levels,

2945
02:18:07,721 --> 02:18:11,160
but you have a feeling we're gonna 
you're going to know their names here in

2946
02:18:11,170 --> 02:18:13,270
the next couple of years.
They're up and coming.

2947
02:18:13,271 --> 02:18:13,930
Guys,
they're young,

2948
02:18:14,580 --> 02:18:16,540
like 21,
22,

2949
02:18:16,541 --> 02:18:17,830
23 year old,
you know,

2950
02:18:17,831 --> 02:18:19,510
kind of making their way.
Um,

2951
02:18:20,130 --> 02:18:24,460
one of them has been watching Irwin's 
videos since he was 15 years old.

2952
02:18:24,490 --> 02:18:26,770
He met her when he was all star struck.
Oh my God,

2953
02:18:26,771 --> 02:18:28,410
this is the core.
How did you even,

2954
02:18:28,450 --> 02:18:29,560
you know,
and,

2955
02:18:29,561 --> 02:18:31,270
uh,
uh,

2956
02:18:31,630 --> 02:18:34,570
they are incorporating movement quite a 
bit,

2957
02:18:34,571 --> 02:18:35,450
so it's not,
you know,

2958
02:18:35,560 --> 02:18:38,320
it's not that they haven't sought him 
out there,

2959
02:18:38,321 --> 02:18:42,240
they're kind of very interested in this 
and doing their own stuff and,

2960
02:18:42,500 --> 02:18:47,500
and,
and finding this stuff on online and 

2961
02:18:47,500 --> 02:18:49,070
watching the door tech portal stuff,
watching Irwin's stuff and um,

2962
02:18:49,260 --> 02:18:54,260
and,
and definitely incorporating a lot of 

2963
02:18:54,260 --> 02:18:54,260
this stuff.

2964
02:18:54,260 --> 02:18:55,680
And one of the kids is a gymnast,
a gymnast before and,

2965
02:18:55,700 --> 02:18:59,650
and so now he can do all kinds of crazy 
shit and they're looking for a niche.

2966
02:18:59,651 --> 02:19:04,510
Definitely they'll looking for an edge.
Even Carlos was looking for,

2967
02:19:05,020 --> 02:19:07,570
well George St Pierre was doing a lot of
gymnastics.

2968
02:19:08,200 --> 02:19:11,250
Cummings does a lot of that as well.
It's the same thing now we're like,

2969
02:19:11,260 --> 02:19:11,520
we,
you know,

2970
02:19:11,521 --> 02:19:13,660
we see with conor mcgregor.
So it's like this big thing.

2971
02:19:13,661 --> 02:19:15,270
All of this,
uh,

2972
02:19:15,480 --> 02:19:17,350
uh,
GSP was,

2973
02:19:17,610 --> 02:19:22,610
he was,
he was doing gymnastics for the same 

2974
02:19:22,610 --> 02:19:23,450
exact reasons to be able to move his 
body better through,

2975
02:19:23,451 --> 02:19:28,451
through space and ultimately become a 
better able to better beat the shit out 

2976
02:19:30,741 --> 02:19:32,420
of people.
That's the goal,

2977
02:19:32,421 --> 02:19:33,120
right?
You know,

2978
02:19:33,140 --> 02:19:33,600
it's,
it's,

2979
02:19:33,680 --> 02:19:36,200
it's fun and it's cool.
It's a cool way to train and,

2980
02:19:36,201 --> 02:19:37,130
you know,
after the fact,

2981
02:19:37,131 --> 02:19:40,370
I think it's,
is a cool fitness,

2982
02:19:40,371 --> 02:19:42,710
mobile modality that's very different.

2983
02:19:42,710 --> 02:19:44,060
I,
I absolutely love it.

2984
02:19:44,270 --> 02:19:46,220
I've been an athlete all my life and I 
can,

2985
02:19:46,310 --> 02:19:48,980
I plan on being an athlete to the 
fucking day I die.

2986
02:19:49,220 --> 02:19:51,050
How much longer do you think you're 
going to be fighting?

2987
02:19:52,040 --> 02:19:54,380
Um,
have you considered that?

2988
02:19:54,440 --> 02:19:59,440
Oh yeah,
because I've heard you talking about 

2989
02:19:59,440 --> 02:20:00,480
that after the Robbie lawler fight.
Um,

2990
02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:02,090
I dunno,
I dunno,

2991
02:20:02,130 --> 02:20:03,440
it's,
I'm,

2992
02:20:03,820 --> 02:20:04,850
I'm probably,
you know,

2993
02:20:05,070 --> 02:20:07,050
31.
I'll be 32 in a few months.

2994
02:20:07,070 --> 02:20:08,630
You're still in your prime?
I am,

2995
02:20:08,750 --> 02:20:10,400
but you know,
this has been,

2996
02:20:10,520 --> 02:20:11,580
it's been a long road.
You know,

2997
02:20:11,660 --> 02:20:16,660
I started training profession.
There's fighting professionally at 18 

2998
02:20:16,660 --> 02:20:17,630
have had 40,
you know,

2999
02:20:17,750 --> 02:20:20,630
over 40 fights and you feel it.
You get dinged up,

3000
02:20:20,930 --> 02:20:23,540
I get dinged up and I,
I still feel great,

3001
02:20:23,630 --> 02:20:28,630
I think.
I think my concern is the longterm 

3002
02:20:28,630 --> 02:20:30,590
neurological stuff that is kind of 
coming to light with,

3003
02:20:30,650 --> 02:20:34,070
you know,
with all this studies on concussions and

3004
02:20:34,400 --> 02:20:35,240
you've seen me fight.

3005
02:20:35,240 --> 02:20:40,240
I don't,
I don't go in there and not take damage 

3006
02:20:40,240 --> 02:20:40,240
and I fucking take damage,
you know,

3007
02:20:40,240 --> 02:20:42,680
I take take punishment,
I take,

3008
02:20:42,710 --> 02:20:45,680
I'll take two to give one and that's 
just Kinda my style.

3009
02:20:45,681 --> 02:20:47,780
And well you didn't fight like that and 
Nick Diaz fight.

3010
02:20:47,781 --> 02:20:49,940
That was like one of the few fights we 
didn't fight like that.

3011
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:51,500
Yeah.
You know,

3012
02:20:52,160 --> 02:20:57,160
I felt I had seen a lot of guys go in 
against Nick Diaz and gas themselves out

3013
02:20:57,680 --> 02:21:00,340
trying to knock that guy out.
And it's like he can't,

3014
02:21:00,380 --> 02:21:04,570
you can't knock him out.
He took a full on a left hook from,

3015
02:21:04,590 --> 02:21:07,460
from Paul Daley,
flopped around a little bit,

3016
02:21:07,730 --> 02:21:12,730
pop back up.
Paul Daley Blues was trying to finish 

3017
02:21:12,730 --> 02:21:13,280
him and then and then got knocked the 
fuck out himself.

3018
02:21:13,560 --> 02:21:15,770
And I've seen a lot of guys,
you know,

3019
02:21:16,880 --> 02:21:19,390
hurt him,
but he's so God damn toughy,

3020
02:21:19,391 --> 02:21:20,960
so hard to put away.

3021
02:21:21,230 --> 02:21:23,180
And so yeah,
it was more of a,

3022
02:21:23,480 --> 02:21:26,270
um,
of a calculated approach,

3023
02:21:26,390 --> 02:21:28,610
you know,
as I got flowing later in the fight,

3024
02:21:28,611 --> 02:21:31,130
I started opening up a little bit.
But,

3025
02:21:31,290 --> 02:21:36,290
um,
I think that's what a lot of new ideas 

3026
02:21:36,290 --> 02:21:38,800
or strategies he,
he wants for what he wants to get in 

3027
02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:38,990
your head and he wants you to fight 
emotionally.

3028
02:21:38,991 --> 02:21:41,270
He wants you to sit there and have a 
face punch,

3029
02:21:41,360 --> 02:21:43,520
punch competition with,
you know,

3030
02:21:43,670 --> 02:21:48,670
oh,
we're going to stand here like it's the 

3031
02:21:48,670 --> 02:21:48,670
fucking school yard.
Was he talking about shit to you?

3032
02:21:48,670 --> 02:21:49,370
He was,
but I just,

3033
02:21:49,430 --> 02:21:52,570
I knew I knew what he's gonna do.
I mean,

3034
02:21:52,580 --> 02:21:55,310
I grew,
I grew up with tools like that,

3035
02:21:55,960 --> 02:21:58,250
you know,
my whole life I was.

3036
02:21:58,470 --> 02:22:03,470
So I was kind of used to that and I knew
that I was going to have to be 

3037
02:22:03,470 --> 02:22:04,470
emotionally.
I'm a prepared.

3038
02:22:04,490 --> 02:22:05,540
Yeah,
yeah,

3039
02:22:05,541 --> 02:22:06,590
yeah.
Emotionally,

3040
02:22:06,640 --> 02:22:11,640
uh,
kind of shut down and just fight a 

3041
02:22:11,640 --> 02:22:11,960
strategic fucking game plan against the 
guy.

3042
02:22:12,310 --> 02:22:13,370
Yeah,
it was,

3043
02:22:13,371 --> 02:22:18,371
uh,
it was interesting to watch that fight 

3044
02:22:18,371 --> 02:22:20,570
because he was extremely frustrated by 
that,

3045
02:22:20,690 --> 02:22:23,150
you know,
and he couldn't get you to change,

3046
02:22:23,300 --> 02:22:25,980
you know,
whereas he's been able to fuck with guys

3047
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:29,250
heads like the frank shamrock fight.
Like you could see frank shamrock going,

3048
02:22:29,370 --> 02:22:31,290
I can't fucking believe this is 
happening to me.

3049
02:22:31,650 --> 02:22:34,260
Like when nick was talking shit to him,
like what bitch,

3050
02:22:34,261 --> 02:22:35,790
what?
And then popping them with a jab.

3051
02:22:36,100 --> 02:22:41,100
You could see like for some people that 
shit-talking becomes overwhelming with 

3052
02:22:41,131 --> 02:22:42,990
nick.
Yeah.

3053
02:22:43,400 --> 02:22:44,720
You know,
it's funny is a,

3054
02:22:45,360 --> 02:22:50,360
both me and cowboy fought the Diaz 
brothers within a few weeks of each 

3055
02:22:50,360 --> 02:22:50,360
other.
Right.

3056
02:22:50,360 --> 02:22:55,200
A cowboy lost to nate and I fought nick 
just a few weeks later.

3057
02:22:55,560 --> 02:23:00,560
And in,
in preparation for both of our camps we 

3058
02:23:00,560 --> 02:23:03,951
would,
we were switching roles and both 

3059
02:23:03,951 --> 02:23:07,041
fighting southpaws and both fighting one
round I would fight southpaws talk a 

3060
02:23:07,041 --> 02:23:10,290
bunch of shit and try and try,
try and try to get,

3061
02:23:10,291 --> 02:23:13,650
you know,
try to emulate his style.

3062
02:23:13,651 --> 02:23:15,360
And then the next round he would do the 
same.

3063
02:23:15,420 --> 02:23:17,140
This is yell out Stockton motherfucker.

3064
02:23:18,930 --> 02:23:19,720
I,
I,

3065
02:23:21,160 --> 02:23:23,850
I did my best in pressure,
reminds me of a Buddhist,

3066
02:23:23,851 --> 02:23:28,460
a hmong drill where they're all in their
meditation posture and uh,

3067
02:23:28,461 --> 02:23:33,461
they,
they partner up and the other guys like 

3068
02:23:33,461 --> 02:23:36,140
trying to instigate them and no crap to 
them to have them get out of their 

3069
02:23:37,681 --> 02:23:40,920
meditation as the drill the.
Well,

3070
02:23:40,921 --> 02:23:42,930
there's definitely something to that.
I mean,

3071
02:23:42,931 --> 02:23:46,380
if you're not used to people that talk 
shit when someone talks shit to you,

3072
02:23:46,381 --> 02:23:50,010
it can be emotionally devastating what's
happening here.

3073
02:23:50,130 --> 02:23:51,660
But if you used to be like,
fuck you,

3074
02:23:51,661 --> 02:23:52,860
I've heard this shit,
you know,

3075
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:55,080
it becomes normal.
You know?

3076
02:23:55,200 --> 02:23:57,810
I mean,
I tried to explain that to fighters when

3077
02:23:57,811 --> 02:24:02,520
they deal with online criticism as well.
Like I've talked to guys who would go on

3078
02:24:02,521 --> 02:24:07,521
like the underground and see like some 
shit that people are talking about them 

3079
02:24:07,521 --> 02:24:08,040
and just be fucking devastated and get 
so upset.

3080
02:24:08,310 --> 02:24:09,060
And I was like,
look man,

3081
02:24:09,061 --> 02:24:14,061
you got to treat it like snake venom.
You get a little bit of that shit in 

3082
02:24:14,061 --> 02:24:15,710
your system and you're going to be okay.
You get a little bit more and eventually

3083
02:24:16,090 --> 02:24:18,600
you build up an immunity to it and then 
you go,

3084
02:24:18,660 --> 02:24:19,830
oh,
I get it.

3085
02:24:19,831 --> 02:24:22,980
You're just a bunch of little console 
who've never accomplished shit.

3086
02:24:23,100 --> 02:24:26,150
So you talking shit about fighters 
calling them pussies and like,

3087
02:24:26,170 --> 02:24:29,190
because some fighters you have a loss 
and you're like,

3088
02:24:29,191 --> 02:24:30,540
good,
I'm glad he got knocked out.

3089
02:24:30,541 --> 02:24:35,541
I fucking hate watching that guy fight.
He's a pussy like damn stuff.

3090
02:24:37,110 --> 02:24:40,070
Oh my God.
It's initially it as like,

3091
02:24:40,100 --> 02:24:40,800
it was like,
whoa.

3092
02:24:40,801 --> 02:24:41,470
After that,
you know,

3093
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:46,520
I'd never experienced that until really 
until after the deal is there had been 

3094
02:24:46,520 --> 02:24:46,860
some.
But after the Diaz fight,

3095
02:24:46,861 --> 02:24:49,860
I mean,
you know that big time.

3096
02:24:49,950 --> 02:24:53,090
So yeah,
I call it the shifts and what I call it,

3097
02:24:53,290 --> 02:24:57,810
the unique snowflakes.
A snowflake syndrome.

3098
02:24:57,860 --> 02:24:59,280
Lucky or told,
since you're a kid,

3099
02:24:59,281 --> 02:25:04,281
you're a unique snowflake,
but the problem is that day they can't 

3100
02:25:04,281 --> 02:25:04,950
stand the heat.
Does that make sense?

3101
02:25:06,540 --> 02:25:10,950
Who are you talking about them?
I love who is the unique snowflake,

3102
02:25:10,951 --> 02:25:15,900
the person talking shit or the fighter,
whoever is like being told all the time,

3103
02:25:15,901 --> 02:25:20,901
hey,
it's okay to be different or it's okay 

3104
02:25:20,901 --> 02:25:22,941
to be this.
And that problem is that sometimes you 

3105
02:25:22,941 --> 02:25:22,941
do need to,
uh,

3106
02:25:22,941 --> 02:25:23,920
hear stuff about

3107
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:28,180
yourself that is challenging and to take
it to not crumble,

3108
02:25:28,520 --> 02:25:30,880
crumble really know.
You need to hear it.

3109
02:25:30,881 --> 02:25:31,450
I mean,
I would,

3110
02:25:31,810 --> 02:25:36,070
I would appreciate it man.
It's hard because I like both ways.

3111
02:25:36,400 --> 02:25:41,400
I kind of love like Nate Diaz punching 
Michael Johnson the face and then 

3112
02:25:41,400 --> 02:25:41,560
pointing at them.
Ah,

3113
02:25:41,561 --> 02:25:42,700
I just fucked you up.
Like,

3114
02:25:42,701 --> 02:25:43,930
it's funny,
you know,

3115
02:25:43,931 --> 02:25:47,450
when Anderson fought nick and nick laid 
down on his back and pretended to sleep,

3116
02:25:47,460 --> 02:25:49,510
sleeping for a second.
I was fucking crying,

3117
02:25:49,580 --> 02:25:54,580
laughing.
I love it when conor mcgregor talks mad 

3118
02:25:54,580 --> 02:25:57,250
shit to Joseph all for months until he 
just rent space in his head to the point

3119
02:25:57,251 --> 02:26:00,100
where although just he literally can't 
fight his fight.

3120
02:26:00,250 --> 02:26:03,940
He has to run at conor because he's just
so overwhelmed with emotion.

3121
02:26:04,150 --> 02:26:06,220
And then connor sleep some.
You know what I mean?

3122
02:26:06,690 --> 02:26:09,640
I like both,
but I prefer in a.

3123
02:26:09,640 --> 02:26:12,040
In a perfect world,
I prefer martial artists.

3124
02:26:12,190 --> 02:26:15,340
I prefer guys that go out there,
treat each other with respect,

3125
02:26:15,341 --> 02:26:19,150
shake each other's hands and then just 
go out and just let their skill,

3126
02:26:19,450 --> 02:26:23,230
but it's an effective tactic to these 
fighters.

3127
02:26:23,231 --> 02:26:25,030
It's part of their weapons.
Fuck.

3128
02:26:25,031 --> 02:26:27,640
It's not something outside their their 
game.

3129
02:26:27,641 --> 02:26:31,080
It's completely embedded in their whole 
game.

3130
02:26:31,150 --> 02:26:31,990
Oh yeah.
Well,

3131
02:26:31,991 --> 02:26:35,590
it's also a slider is defined themselves
by respect,

3132
02:26:35,830 --> 02:26:37,600
by how much someone respects them and 
how.

3133
02:26:37,790 --> 02:26:41,500
How much like like to a fighter when 
someone's not scared with them,

3134
02:26:41,530 --> 02:26:46,530
it becomes a very devastating thing.
Like I remember when Anderson fought 

3135
02:26:46,530 --> 02:26:49,951
Chris Weidman when right Weidman and 
they understand what the winds and 

3136
02:26:49,951 --> 02:26:51,190
Anderson staring at him looking at him 
and Weidman goes,

3137
02:26:51,430 --> 02:26:52,450
I'm not scared of you,
dude.

3138
02:26:52,870 --> 02:26:54,880
I'm not scared of you.
And you could see Anderson was like,

3139
02:26:54,881 --> 02:26:59,881
shit,
this guy really isn't fucking scared of 

3140
02:26:59,881 --> 02:27:01,891
me.
Like you could see there was a tangible 

3141
02:27:01,891 --> 02:27:02,140
moment where this guy wasn't pretending.

3142
02:27:02,140 --> 02:27:04,690
He wasn't scared.
He just literally wasn't scared.

3143
02:27:05,230 --> 02:27:10,230
Then I could feel it.
That similar situation at the weigh ins 

3144
02:27:10,361 --> 02:27:14,320
with Ronda Rousey and Holly Holm.
Yes.

3145
02:27:14,410 --> 02:27:19,410
Same thing and I felt like that was a 
precursor to what ended up happening.

3146
02:27:19,481 --> 02:27:24,481
Well,
the big part was when Holly didn't 

3147
02:27:24,481 --> 02:27:24,481
flinch exactly when Rhonda was yelling 
at you,

3148
02:27:24,481 --> 02:27:24,481
fake bitch,
you know,

3149
02:27:24,481 --> 02:27:25,750
preacher's daughter,
all this stuff and stuff,

3150
02:27:25,751 --> 02:27:30,751
and she bought all this stuff on 
instagram about her and holly just 

3151
02:27:30,751 --> 02:27:30,790
standing there and then when I 
interviewed holly afterward she goes,

3152
02:27:30,791 --> 02:27:32,710
well,
it's just trying to get a sip of water.

3153
02:27:33,010 --> 02:27:34,450
And you realized like,
Whoa,

3154
02:27:34,451 --> 02:27:38,020
this girl is so fucking composed,
like so composed.

3155
02:27:38,440 --> 02:27:41,740
And it also,
she had been to so many dances.

3156
02:27:42,100 --> 02:27:46,000
She fought for so many boxing titles and
kickboxing and MMA.

3157
02:27:46,120 --> 02:27:51,120
She'd been in so many dances that the 
bright lights were in an uncomfortable 

3158
02:27:51,120 --> 02:27:51,120
thing to her.

3159
02:27:51,120 --> 02:27:51,940
She had.
She's like,

3160
02:27:51,941 --> 02:27:53,190
okay,
we're here again now.

3161
02:27:53,370 --> 02:27:55,720
Whereas for a lot of people it's like,
Whoa,

3162
02:27:55,721 --> 02:27:58,090
this is the big show.
Holy Shit.

3163
02:27:58,091 --> 02:27:59,470
I can't believe I'm here.
Yup.

3164
02:28:00,400 --> 02:28:05,400
Being overwhelmed by the moment is 
almost something that you can't prepare 

3165
02:28:05,400 --> 02:28:06,880
for it.
It seems to me that for a lot of people,

3166
02:28:07,120 --> 02:28:12,120
some people just naturally can deal with
moments and some people they have to 

3167
02:28:12,120 --> 02:28:13,750
experience it a couple times to get 
loose.

3168
02:28:13,810 --> 02:28:18,810
They get got to get comfortable with it 
and then they have to like some people 

3169
02:28:18,810 --> 02:28:18,810
like cowboys.
A perfect example.

3170
02:28:18,880 --> 02:28:22,910
He fights his best when he fights a lot.
He's got to fight all the time.

3171
02:28:23,030 --> 02:28:28,030
He fights three,
four times a year in then you're going 

3172
02:28:28,030 --> 02:28:29,981
to get the best cowboy you can get,
but you make them take a year off or 

3173
02:28:29,981 --> 02:28:32,810
take a long time off and it's just.
He's much better when he's active.

3174
02:28:32,930 --> 02:28:37,930
He's gotta stay loose and loosened up 
and fired up and to fight with Tim 

3175
02:28:38,161 --> 02:28:40,400
tiffany means is going to be fucking 
crazy.

3176
02:28:40,520 --> 02:28:41,510
Yeah.
They announced that.

3177
02:28:41,511 --> 02:28:42,320
I was like,
whoa.

3178
02:28:43,080 --> 02:28:44,700
Why did cowboy decided to take that 
fight?

3179
02:28:44,701 --> 02:28:46,970
Because he doesn't like cutting weight.
I have no idea.

3180
02:28:47,540 --> 02:28:48,470
I don't know.
I haven't.

3181
02:28:48,471 --> 02:28:50,450
I haven't talked to cowboy,
but I mean I said,

3182
02:28:50,451 --> 02:28:51,200
hey,
what's up?

3183
02:28:51,400 --> 02:28:52,100
You know,
we didn't,

3184
02:28:52,130 --> 02:28:53,720
but we didn't really talk about the 
fight at all.

3185
02:28:53,780 --> 02:28:54,650
Well,
he's so crazy.

3186
02:28:54,651 --> 02:28:56,150
You could probably offer him brock 
lesnar.

3187
02:28:56,151 --> 02:28:56,840
He left.
Come on,

3188
02:28:56,900 --> 02:28:57,470
bring it on.
Oh,

3189
02:28:57,471 --> 02:28:58,310
for sure.
Exactly.

3190
02:28:58,311 --> 02:28:59,000
Do it.
That's it.

3191
02:28:59,110 --> 02:29:01,910
That's why he's because he's cowboy.
Yeah.

3192
02:29:01,911 --> 02:29:03,020
He's just nuts,
man.

3193
02:29:03,070 --> 02:29:04,640
Yeah.
He's a fun dude,

3194
02:29:04,670 --> 02:29:05,630
man.
Yeah,

3195
02:29:06,230 --> 02:29:08,690
absolutely fun to watch.
Fight and fuck.

3196
02:29:08,691 --> 02:29:10,340
He's either.
He's either on or he's off.

3197
02:29:10,360 --> 02:29:11,390
Yeah,
unfortunately.

3198
02:29:11,540 --> 02:29:12,470
Unfortunately.
Well,

3199
02:29:12,471 --> 02:29:15,970
I don't even necessarily know if he 
wasn't that he was not on.

3200
02:29:15,970 --> 02:29:18,150
I said Dos Anjos.
He's a fucking demon.

3201
02:29:18,440 --> 02:29:21,410
He's just jumps all over you.
He did that to him.

3202
02:29:21,411 --> 02:29:22,750
Did that to pettis?
Yeah.

3203
02:29:22,850 --> 02:29:25,400
Nobody's done that to pedis man.
Dude,

3204
02:29:25,401 --> 02:29:30,160
but he's just so fucking fat and again,
he's a guy who trains with nickerson.

3205
02:29:30,200 --> 02:29:35,200
Nickerson has gotten doing all these 
plyometrics and jumps and sprints and 

3206
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:37,570
foot strengthening stuff.
You ever seen that stuff with her?

3207
02:29:37,780 --> 02:29:42,780
They're lying on their back and their 
feet are pushing up these bars and 

3208
02:29:42,780 --> 02:29:46,661
they're kicking up these bars and 
catching them with their feet and 

3209
02:29:46,661 --> 02:29:46,910
exploding with their feet.
I saw,

3210
02:29:46,911 --> 02:29:51,911
I saw the video for the cowboy fights.
It's all based on Marv Marinovich is 

3211
02:29:52,430 --> 02:29:56,720
training stretch strategies as the same 
sort of shit that he used with Bj Penn.

3212
02:29:57,200 --> 02:30:02,200
Really,
it's really interesting that I remember 

3213
02:30:02,200 --> 02:30:03,980
watching that and bj was standing on the
tennis balls and all that sort of,

3214
02:30:04,640 --> 02:30:06,350
you know,
very similar,

3215
02:30:06,510 --> 02:30:07,160
very similar.

3216
02:30:07,160 --> 02:30:08,630
And it's,
you know,

3217
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:14,200
it's all veRy similar,
kind of look at different ways to 

3218
02:30:14,200 --> 02:30:15,080
different branches,
but it's all kind of,

3219
02:30:15,140 --> 02:30:16,820
you know,
all this,

3220
02:30:17,090 --> 02:30:18,980
you know,
the same goal.

3221
02:30:19,310 --> 02:30:22,420
So what's next for you now?
Do you hang back for what?

3222
02:30:22,460 --> 02:30:25,940
You had a brutal,
crazy five round war for the title where

3223
02:30:26,270 --> 02:30:29,420
it was as close as you're ever going to 
fucking get.

3224
02:30:29,421 --> 02:30:31,490
I mean,
a lot of people saw it your way.

3225
02:30:31,760 --> 02:30:35,210
A lot of people saw a robbie's way was 
just that close split decision.

3226
02:30:35,780 --> 02:30:37,070
Um,
what do you do now?

3227
02:30:38,010 --> 02:30:40,450
Um,
I,

3228
02:30:40,870 --> 02:30:42,590
I'd like another shot at robbie,
you know,

3229
02:30:42,640 --> 02:30:45,320
I,
I felt like I won the fight.

3230
02:30:45,560 --> 02:30:46,940
Um,
and like you said,

3231
02:30:46,950 --> 02:30:51,950
it's razor,
razor close decision could have gone 

3232
02:30:51,950 --> 02:30:51,950
either way.
Mma,

3233
02:30:51,950 --> 02:30:56,351
judgIng a subjective,
the scoring system so fucking crazy to 

3234
02:30:56,351 --> 02:30:58,190
it is nuts that we're still using that 
10 point must system.

3235
02:30:58,280 --> 02:30:58,790
Yeah.
Yeah.

3236
02:30:58,791 --> 02:31:03,791
It doesn't,
doesn't apply very well to animate it 

3237
02:31:03,791 --> 02:31:04,280
in.
That's proven over and over again.

3238
02:31:04,580 --> 02:31:05,570
Um,
yeah.

3239
02:31:05,571 --> 02:31:06,180
I mean,
I'd,

3240
02:31:06,181 --> 02:31:07,410
I'd like another shot at,
uh,

3241
02:31:07,700 --> 02:31:09,320
at robby,
I feel like I should have the belt right

3242
02:31:09,321 --> 02:31:11,690
now,
but it seems like tyron woodley's next,

3243
02:31:11,750 --> 02:31:16,750
right?
I mean at least he was sort of promised 

3244
02:31:16,750 --> 02:31:19,211
that and based on the hendricks we're 
hendrix didn't make weight and um,

3245
02:31:19,950 --> 02:31:23,250
it seems like that's what's probably 
being set up,

3246
02:31:23,251 --> 02:31:28,251
but you never know what the doc mean.
Misha tate was supposed to fight ronda 

3247
02:31:28,251 --> 02:31:31,240
if she Beat jessica.
I think that's who it was.

3248
02:31:32,700 --> 02:31:35,520
And then they decided no.
so it's,

3249
02:31:36,330 --> 02:31:39,240
it's interesting because the ufc kinda 
decided to call the shots.

3250
02:31:39,450 --> 02:31:41,910
Has anybody talked to you about whether 
or not they would do that again?

3251
02:31:42,020 --> 02:31:43,260
Uh,
I think it's,

3252
02:31:43,430 --> 02:31:44,990
it's definitely a possibility.
Uh,

3253
02:31:45,100 --> 02:31:50,100
you know,
I think the first fight they made that 

3254
02:31:50,100 --> 02:31:53,301
fight because that was the fight that 
people wanted to see among any of the 

3255
02:31:53,301 --> 02:31:53,680
contenders that,
that,

3256
02:31:53,710 --> 02:31:58,710
that was the,
that was the one that got everybody 

3257
02:31:58,710 --> 02:32:01,200
excited that that was the one and a 
rematch of that fight.

3258
02:32:01,320 --> 02:32:02,250
Oh yeah,
come on now.

3259
02:32:02,610 --> 02:32:05,610
Well,
I think as far as public interest,

3260
02:32:05,640 --> 02:32:07,230
that would be the biggest fight out 
there.

3261
02:32:07,350 --> 02:32:10,200
Yeah.
But I feel like I just hate when someone

3262
02:32:10,201 --> 02:32:12,050
gets promised something,
you know,

3263
02:32:12,140 --> 02:32:15,930
and I would feel the same way if it was 
you like tyron woodley get promised that

3264
02:32:15,931 --> 02:32:17,850
title fight.
If he beat hendrix,

3265
02:32:17,851 --> 02:32:22,851
hendrix fucks up.
It doesn't make weight and the fight 

3266
02:32:22,851 --> 02:32:23,780
fights off and then woodley sorta left 
out to dry.

3267
02:32:24,300 --> 02:32:25,750
I feel for him,
you know,

3268
02:32:25,830 --> 02:32:26,970
and I do too.
And,

3269
02:32:26,971 --> 02:32:27,810
and shit,
you know,

3270
02:32:27,850 --> 02:32:32,850
have,
I have a last woodley and that that's 

3271
02:32:32,850 --> 02:32:32,850
definitely on my radar to,
to,

3272
02:32:32,850 --> 02:32:36,870
to avenge that loss,
a loss like that and injury loss.

3273
02:32:36,930 --> 02:32:41,440
Fuck with you as much as a loss by 
decision or you know,

3274
02:32:41,470 --> 02:32:45,120
I mean that's a kind of a crazy loss 
because you need blew out.

3275
02:32:45,140 --> 02:32:50,140
Yeah,
I think even more so just because the 

3276
02:32:50,140 --> 02:32:53,571
fact that I,
I didn't get to do as much as I wanted 

3277
02:32:53,571 --> 02:32:53,571
it to do,
you know,

3278
02:32:53,571 --> 02:32:57,090
I didn't,
I didn't get to leave everything out 

3279
02:32:57,090 --> 02:32:57,090
there.

3280
02:32:57,090 --> 02:32:57,090
This,
this last one.

3281
02:32:57,090 --> 02:32:58,110
That's a bummer.
I didn't take the belt home that night.

3282
02:32:58,440 --> 02:33:01,410
Didn't go my way,
but I pushed it.

3283
02:33:01,411 --> 02:33:05,550
I was able to fucking empty the tank.
He definitely emptied the tank.

3284
02:33:05,551 --> 02:33:08,910
Yeah.
And in the woodley fight I didn't.

3285
02:33:08,960 --> 02:33:09,430
Um,
I,

3286
02:33:09,480 --> 02:33:11,250
you know,
my body gave out my knee blew out.

3287
02:33:11,251 --> 02:33:12,480
So,
um,

3288
02:33:12,630 --> 02:33:13,620
yeah,
from that perspective,

3289
02:33:13,650 --> 02:33:18,650
I,
I definitely see where you're coming 

3290
02:33:18,650 --> 02:33:18,650
from.
YeAh,

3291
02:33:18,650 --> 02:33:18,650
I mean,
yeah,

3292
02:33:18,650 --> 02:33:18,650
he,
he was promised a fight,

3293
02:33:18,650 --> 02:33:22,470
but I'm not in charge of tyron.
I'm not in charge of picking the fight.

3294
02:33:22,471 --> 02:33:23,610
I'm in charge of,
you know,

3295
02:33:23,910 --> 02:33:27,630
carlos condit and trying to get myself 
in the best fight.

3296
02:33:28,050 --> 02:33:29,730
That being said,
you know,

3297
02:33:29,790 --> 02:33:34,790
honestly,
that's about the only fight that 

3298
02:33:34,790 --> 02:33:34,790
interests me at this point.
Well,

3299
02:33:34,790 --> 02:33:37,701
I'll tell you what,
I wouldn't be mad if they decided to 

3300
02:33:37,701 --> 02:33:37,701
make a rematch.
I feel bad for tyron,

3301
02:33:37,701 --> 02:33:38,430
but a fuck.

3302
02:33:38,430 --> 02:33:40,200
I'd love to see that again.
Yeah,

3303
02:33:40,470 --> 02:33:45,470
I'd love to do that again.
That's how much time would you need off 

3304
02:33:45,470 --> 02:33:46,560
after a fight like that?
Um,

3305
02:33:46,980 --> 02:33:49,020
I think it'd be,
it'd be ready to go and,

3306
02:33:49,740 --> 02:33:50,640
you know,
late spring,

3307
02:33:50,641 --> 02:33:53,850
early summer,
ufc 200.

3308
02:33:55,170 --> 02:33:57,090
Sounds good to me.
Sounds good to me.

3309
02:33:57,091 --> 02:33:59,610
I don't know.
That would be,

3310
02:34:00,300 --> 02:34:02,540
that'd be ufc 200.
That's home.

3311
02:34:02,660 --> 02:34:04,010
My goodness.
You know,

3312
02:34:04,290 --> 02:34:05,010
I,
I,

3313
02:34:05,760 --> 02:34:09,210
I wanted that fight to be legendary and 
I think that it lived up to that.

3314
02:34:09,270 --> 02:34:14,270
Oh,
it was legend and it was one of the 

3315
02:34:14,270 --> 02:34:14,270
greatest fights I've ever seen.
yeah.

3316
02:34:14,270 --> 02:34:15,900
so I've probably called 1500 fights or 
something like that.

3317
02:34:15,901 --> 02:34:18,040
Something crazy like that.
That was easily in

3318
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:21,700
the top 10.
Just everybody wants to see a sequel,

3319
02:34:21,930 --> 02:34:25,150
a concept like an unfinished.
Tyron woodley.

3320
02:34:25,151 --> 02:34:30,151
He's right now listening to golf and I,
I understand where he's coming from,

3321
02:34:32,160 --> 02:34:33,220
but yeah,
I get it.

3322
02:34:33,730 --> 02:34:38,730
I get it to hey,
maybe they can go fucking give him a 

3323
02:34:38,730 --> 02:34:38,730
little.
Sorry.

3324
02:34:38,730 --> 02:34:41,860
Alyssa tyron,
kick back,

3325
02:34:41,861 --> 02:34:43,720
relax,
have a good time.

3326
02:34:44,740 --> 02:34:46,090
Um,
but,

3327
02:34:46,091 --> 02:34:46,900
uh,
you know,

3328
02:34:47,050 --> 02:34:48,160
I dunno,
I still,

3329
02:34:48,220 --> 02:34:49,540
I still love this shit.
I mean,

3330
02:34:49,541 --> 02:34:52,460
I still,
I still love the process 20,

3331
02:34:52,480 --> 02:34:55,970
can't even fucking fight week.
I enjoy and you know,

3332
02:34:56,110 --> 02:35:01,110
that's awesome.
One of my favorite things in life is to 

3333
02:35:01,110 --> 02:35:01,600
get in there and pick and mix it up with
a guy like robbie so.

3334
02:35:02,260 --> 02:35:07,260
Well it was one of my favorite things to
watch because it was just an amazing 

3335
02:35:07,260 --> 02:35:07,260
fire.
It was,

3336
02:35:07,260 --> 02:35:07,260
like I said,
after the fight,

3337
02:35:07,260 --> 02:35:12,061
it was an honor.
It was an honor to be there and to call 

3338
02:35:12,061 --> 02:35:12,061
it because I know that when

3339
02:35:12,840 --> 02:35:17,840
this was all over and we're old and 
we're sitting around at a bar at a 

3340
02:35:17,840 --> 02:35:19,510
picnic someday or were picnicking.
If I want to,

3341
02:35:19,511 --> 02:35:21,810
talking about,
we're talking about the past,

3342
02:35:21,840 --> 02:35:23,760
we're going to talk about that fight.
You know,

3343
02:35:23,820 --> 02:35:28,820
the way people talk about leonard and 
duran or with the way people talk about 

3344
02:35:28,820 --> 02:35:31,650
any great crazy fight that they were.
They were there for,

3345
02:35:31,710 --> 02:35:34,020
you know,
and in winter lose.

3346
02:35:34,021 --> 02:35:37,620
Ultimately that's,
that's what I want to be said.

3347
02:35:37,621 --> 02:35:39,570
That's the legacy that I want to leave.
Well,

3348
02:35:39,571 --> 02:35:44,571
I think it was martial arts in its best 
form and a lot of ways it was a heart 

3349
02:35:44,610 --> 02:35:46,980
determination,
willpower technique,

3350
02:35:47,310 --> 02:35:50,130
uh,
the discipline to go through camp to get

3351
02:35:50,131 --> 02:35:52,770
yourself in the kind of shape that you 
need to be in,

3352
02:35:52,771 --> 02:35:57,771
to compete for five rounds like that,
which is just an insane amount of 

3353
02:35:57,771 --> 02:36:01,881
physical conditioning immune.
You guys fucking emptied and your 

3354
02:36:01,881 --> 02:36:05,370
workload was extremely high in that 
fight especially kicks.

3355
02:36:05,590 --> 02:36:07,350
I remember that was one of the things 
that we commented on,

3356
02:36:07,351 --> 02:36:09,510
like how many kicks you had thrown.
I mean,

3357
02:36:09,511 --> 02:36:12,840
it was a really a really fucking crazy,
crazy fight.

3358
02:36:12,890 --> 02:36:14,180
Yeah.
Yeah,

3359
02:36:14,230 --> 02:36:15,170
it was,
it was fun,

3360
02:36:15,171 --> 02:36:16,490
man.
I had fun.

3361
02:36:16,530 --> 02:36:18,320
I don't know,
maybe maybe I'm a little bit twisted,

3362
02:36:18,321 --> 02:36:18,610
but,
uh,

3363
02:36:18,770 --> 02:36:21,260
that was uh,
I was definitely say you're a little bit

3364
02:36:21,330 --> 02:36:23,820
of,
you know,

3365
02:36:24,240 --> 02:36:28,270
that was the kicks were a big part of 
the strategy to,

3366
02:36:28,271 --> 02:36:33,271
uh,
I think that a lot of people wonder why 

3367
02:36:33,271 --> 02:36:33,770
is it that a lower was not as aggressive
as usual.

3368
02:36:34,100 --> 02:36:39,100
I believe there is a reason because it's
not like he was less hungry or listened 

3369
02:36:39,100 --> 02:36:39,920
in shape.
It's because the strategy worked,

3370
02:36:39,950 --> 02:36:44,350
have a higher volume and a courtesy and 
uh,

3371
02:36:44,360 --> 02:36:46,440
with,
with those cakes to,

3372
02:36:47,040 --> 02:36:52,040
to lower his,
his aggressiveness and worked with kicks

3373
02:36:52,891 --> 02:36:56,750
her always so dangerous too because it 
just takes one slip up,

3374
02:36:57,050 --> 02:36:57,620
you know,
it's there,

3375
02:36:57,690 --> 02:37:01,550
there is so much harder than punches and
you're taking them on your arms and they

3376
02:37:01,551 --> 02:37:05,080
fuck your arms up the point where you 
can't throw punches anymore.

3377
02:37:05,090 --> 02:37:07,560
So you gotta be careful what you absorb,
right?

3378
02:37:07,600 --> 02:37:12,600
It's part,
it's the volume is statistically the 

3379
02:37:12,600 --> 02:37:15,431
volume is getting to create damage to 
two different diverse part the body.

3380
02:37:16,220 --> 02:37:16,950
So when,
uh,

3381
02:37:16,970 --> 02:37:17,420
you know,
I've,

3382
02:37:17,421 --> 02:37:19,310
I've heard the debate about the fight 
metrics,

3383
02:37:19,311 --> 02:37:23,510
how I threw a lot,
I didn't necessarily land a lot.

3384
02:37:23,740 --> 02:37:28,740
Um,
and I feel like the kick and the kicks 

3385
02:37:29,001 --> 02:37:29,980
and the,
the volume of,

3386
02:37:29,981 --> 02:37:34,981
of punches that I was,
that I was throwing out was the 

3387
02:37:34,981 --> 02:37:37,460
equivalent of a say,
putting down cover fire.

3388
02:37:37,461 --> 02:37:39,830
If you were in a firefight.
Yeah,

3389
02:37:39,880 --> 02:37:41,860
you're not necessarily a,
you know,

3390
02:37:41,970 --> 02:37:43,970
you know,
pop and people's nuggets,

3391
02:37:44,150 --> 02:37:46,070
but you are,
you know,

3392
02:37:46,071 --> 02:37:48,320
that it's part of an overall strategy 
to,

3393
02:37:48,350 --> 02:37:49,580
to come out with victory.
You're,

3394
02:37:49,670 --> 02:37:53,060
you're your throwing him off,
you're making him keep his hands up,

3395
02:37:53,061 --> 02:37:56,240
you're keeping that distance.
You are making the enemy.

3396
02:37:56,241 --> 02:38:00,470
Keep their head down in this analogy and
you weren't also loading up either.

3397
02:38:00,471 --> 02:38:05,471
You were touching them with a lot of 
theSe things and keep him on his toes 

3398
02:38:05,471 --> 02:38:08,710
and you know,
that was something that dwayne was 

3399
02:38:08,710 --> 02:38:08,840
calling tj dillashaw to do in his fight 
with dominick cruz.

3400
02:38:08,840 --> 02:38:13,840
He was to just go out and touch them,
just keep touching them and then the 

3401
02:38:13,840 --> 02:38:17,051
shots will come,
but he got so emotional and tied up and 

3402
02:38:17,051 --> 02:38:20,951
trying to knock dominic out.
You could see him standing flatfooted 

3403
02:38:20,951 --> 02:38:21,900
swinging more single shots,
single kicks,

3404
02:38:21,901 --> 02:38:23,400
single punches this.
Yeah.

3405
02:38:23,401 --> 02:38:27,950
This guy that had looked just incredibly
dynamic with his footwork and his.

3406
02:38:28,010 --> 02:38:32,030
He kind of looked like dominick cruz 
against other guys and look really well.

3407
02:38:32,180 --> 02:38:37,180
Dominick cruz goes out there and makes 
him look like a very orthodox,

3408
02:38:37,490 --> 02:38:39,260
a fighter.
He's not,

3409
02:38:39,261 --> 02:38:41,060
he's not moving like that.
And at times,

3410
02:38:41,120 --> 02:38:46,120
yeah,
at times initially they came out and 

3411
02:38:46,120 --> 02:38:46,120
they were both moving like that.
I'm like,

3412
02:38:46,120 --> 02:38:46,120
oh,
well this is.

3413
02:38:46,120 --> 02:38:50,590
This is crazy.
These guys are going to open up a worm 

3414
02:38:50,590 --> 02:38:52,780
hole.
It's going to be wild.

3415
02:38:53,050 --> 02:38:58,050
Well,
I think that's what a lot of us 

3416
02:38:58,050 --> 02:38:58,050
expected,
but um,

3417
02:38:58,050 --> 02:38:58,580
it's interesting that would,
what uriah said about tj,

3418
02:38:58,790 --> 02:39:03,790
that he had a feeling that tj was going 
to get emotional because tj is a super 

3419
02:39:03,790 --> 02:39:05,360
competitive guy and he'd get really 
geared up and you know,

3420
02:39:06,050 --> 02:39:08,000
that's a,
that was an interesting fight.

3421
02:39:08,030 --> 02:39:13,030
Really interesting fight to watch.
It's crazy that dominick cruz able to 

3422
02:39:13,030 --> 02:39:14,480
come back having essentially only fought
once in four years.

3423
02:39:14,481 --> 02:39:15,490
Yeah.
And,

3424
02:39:15,580 --> 02:39:17,150
and when the title.
I like that.

3425
02:39:17,151 --> 02:39:17,630
Yeah.
Yeah.

3426
02:39:17,631 --> 02:39:20,480
He's a different kind of animal.
He's a smart motherfucker to.

3427
02:39:20,600 --> 02:39:21,960
You talked to that guy.
Oh yeah.

3428
02:39:22,200 --> 02:39:23,960
Oh yeah.
I've known him since wec.

3429
02:39:24,260 --> 02:39:29,260
I listened to his analysis of fights,
like when he talks about like what 

3430
02:39:29,260 --> 02:39:33,580
mistakes guys make and things guys are 
doing right and correctly and what they 

3431
02:39:33,580 --> 02:39:36,581
need to do and you know,
you realize like he's operating on a 

3432
02:39:36,581 --> 02:39:36,581
very,
very high level,

3433
02:39:36,581 --> 02:39:37,580
very high level.
Absolutely.

3434
02:39:37,850 --> 02:39:42,850
And that's probably part of why he was 
able to come back and compete at the 

3435
02:39:42,850 --> 02:39:44,090
level that he did because he,
you know,

3436
02:39:44,091 --> 02:39:46,850
he was sitting there analyzing this,
you know,

3437
02:39:47,090 --> 02:39:48,260
they,
they talk about,

3438
02:39:48,350 --> 02:39:51,440
you can sit there and do repetitions of 
a kick or a technique,

3439
02:39:51,760 --> 02:39:52,970
you know,
100 times,

3440
02:39:53,240 --> 02:39:55,640
but it,
it's almost the same,

3441
02:39:55,760 --> 02:40:00,760
uh,
thing neurologically to visualize 

3442
02:40:00,760 --> 02:40:04,601
yourself doing that.
They say that that visual visual 

3443
02:40:04,601 --> 02:40:08,261
training is a similar,
very similar and almost as effective as 

3444
02:40:08,261 --> 02:40:08,430
actually doing it.
Yeah.

3445
02:40:08,570 --> 02:40:09,640
So I wonder if,
I mean,

3446
02:40:09,970 --> 02:40:12,710
I wonder if there's kind of a,
of a correlation there.

3447
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:14,060
I would imagine there is.
Well,

3448
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:19,100
he's interesting in a way also because 
he says that there's no such thing as 

3449
02:40:19,100 --> 02:40:20,820
octagon rust like I asked him about and 
he's like,

3450
02:40:20,821 --> 02:40:25,110
it's not real octagon,
it's mental weakness if he believes that

3451
02:40:25,111 --> 02:40:27,270
it's true,
but when you watch the fight,

3452
02:40:27,300 --> 02:40:28,530
it certainly looked true.
I mean,

3453
02:40:28,531 --> 02:40:31,590
he didn't look rusty at all.
It's just fucking kind of nuts.

3454
02:40:32,390 --> 02:40:34,530
Um,
I think that's the thing.

3455
02:40:34,710 --> 02:40:37,890
It's a belief thing.
He's not going to let that.

3456
02:40:38,240 --> 02:40:40,170
Not for one.
One second.

3457
02:40:40,171 --> 02:40:42,060
Hinder him,
agree with carlos,

3458
02:40:42,061 --> 02:40:45,000
because in the absence of of actual 
movement training,

3459
02:40:45,001 --> 02:40:50,001
due to his injury,
it's very likely that it was tilled 

3460
02:40:50,001 --> 02:40:53,180
visualizing everyday.
He's movements in therefore using his 

3461
02:40:53,180 --> 02:40:55,940
brain to keep practicing the movements,
even though a body could not,

3462
02:40:55,980 --> 02:40:57,940
the body could not follow out that,
you know,

3463
02:40:58,120 --> 02:41:03,120
during that time you examine dominic's 
footwork to examine guys that are 

3464
02:41:03,120 --> 02:41:03,150
fighting.

3465
02:41:03,170 --> 02:41:08,170
Do you watch like different guys 
movements and it's close to perfection 

3466
02:41:08,170 --> 02:41:11,550
in easy using a particular technique.
Yes,

3467
02:41:11,551 --> 02:41:16,551
but also most importantly,
it's all about he's alertness and 

3468
02:41:16,591 --> 02:41:19,440
responsiveness and timing that again,
it's,

3469
02:41:19,441 --> 02:41:20,010
it's,
it's,

3470
02:41:20,060 --> 02:41:20,580
it's,
uh,

3471
02:41:20,910 --> 02:41:24,420
it's not how much your body can,
can do it,

3472
02:41:24,720 --> 02:41:29,720
how much your mind is.
He's able to operate your body to 

3473
02:41:29,720 --> 02:41:30,400
achieve that.
Yeah.

3474
02:41:30,450 --> 02:41:32,850
So you need a brain that is extremely 
sharp.

3475
02:41:32,990 --> 02:41:35,370
Um,
well I was super impressed with him,

3476
02:41:35,371 --> 02:41:38,400
but one of the things that I thought of 
when I watched that fight is goddamn how

3477
02:41:38,401 --> 02:41:40,560
good his mighty mouse,
you gotta take a leak.

3478
02:41:40,590 --> 02:41:41,520
So what's going on?
Yeah,

3479
02:41:41,530 --> 02:41:43,530
let's just wrap this fucker up.
Uh,

3480
02:41:43,590 --> 02:41:44,250
it's,
it's,

3481
02:41:44,251 --> 02:41:44,910
uh,
it's,

3482
02:41:44,911 --> 02:41:46,530
yeah,
