00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,030
Hey,
hey,

2
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,950
hey.
Hey everybody.

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,400
Hey,
I need a new way now.

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,000
It's not so boring.
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience

5
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:18,910
podcast is brought to you by 
squarespace.com.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,580
Squarespace and is,
is,

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,370
is,
is.

8
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:26,371
It is.
It is an extremely easy way to build an 

9
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:29,041
awesome website.
Everything is integrated free domains 

10
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:31,300
and great designs.
Hosting all in one place.

11
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:33,510
You can choose from over 20 bad ass 
designs.

12
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:37,450
Use Your custom images and content if 
you've never been to squarespace before.

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,980
It's beautiful invention.
It's one thing that I have wanted for 

14
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,240
decades since I got online.
I guess it probably isn't decades,

15
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,880
a decade,
maybe two decades.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,380
Jesus Christ,
I'm old.

17
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:55,660
Um,
I've always wanted to be able to create 

18
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,261
my own website,
but I didn't have the patience and wait 

19
00:00:58,261 --> 00:00:58,570
to add to like sit down and learn how to
code.

20
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,060
But you could do something on 
squarespace,

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,440
simple and easy and have it be a really 
nice website.

22
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,910
In fact,
we're going to put on a contest.

23
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,910
We're working out the details right now.
Um,

24
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,040
but squarespace and this podcast are 
working together to,

25
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:15,830
uh,
to.

26
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,100
We're going to set up some sort of a 
contest where the person who has the 

27
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,540
best website they designed using 
squarespace get something cool or 

28
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:24,540
something like that.
We'll figure out what it is,

29
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,110
but it's a,
it's a website.

30
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:31,111
It's a product that I really believe in.
They also have a new ecommerce product 

31
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:34,711
called Galapagos,
so it's a new template that will 

32
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:37,381
showcase your ecommerce products in a 
more interesting way than typical 

33
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:41,070
orderly grid and galapagos features,
a dynamic product mosaic with custom 

34
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,560
rollover states that allow you to 
display an alternate image when visitors

35
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:49,561
hover over each item.
So like when you go over night and with 

36
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:49,561
your cursor,
your pointer,

37
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:53,230
you know,
that little arrow thing or a finger if 

38
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:53,230
you're a fucking Weirdo.

39
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:53,230
Uh,
the template also,

40
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:56,350
uh,
is preset with the content pages.

41
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:58,960
You need to have your shop up and 
running quickly.

42
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:02,890
If you're a musician,
you can sell music on squarespace.

43
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,930
Super easy.
You can set up your website to do that 

44
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,170
digital downloads and merchandise 
directly from your website.

45
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:11,020
You can set up an online store.
It works on everything.

46
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:12,280
Ipod,
android,

47
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:14,950
windows,
if you're one of those Unix Weirdos,

48
00:02:14,951 --> 00:02:19,390
it works on all that shit.

We're also brought to you by lumosity 
and lumosity.com

57
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:54,301
is one of my favorite podcast sponsors 
because it's essentially a gym for your 

58
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:56,380
brain.
As I've gotten older,

59
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,740
luckily I'm involved in things like the 
podcast comedy and you know in mma 

60
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:04,210
commentary to a certain extent that keep
my brain moving,

61
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,730
but a lot of us aren't.
You know,

62
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,740
a lot of us are stuck in cubicles and 
your fucking brain turns to Jello and 

63
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,280
your brain works.
I don't know how your brain works is.

64
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:17,290
I'm not a doctor,
but there's a science called 

65
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,351
neuroplasticity and that's what square,
that's what lumosity is designed around 

66
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:25,110
and lumosity is designed around the idea
that you can keep your brain active by 

67
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:28,120
using games.
It's not boring.

68
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:31,300
It's not like sitting there trying to do
complex mathematics.

69
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:36,610
It's.
It's all designed as fun games and fun 

70
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,321
games with your specific goals in mind,
like there is a bunch of different 

71
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:41,830
options like memory and then when you 
get to memory,

72
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:45,170
if you go to lumosity.com,
forward slash Joe,

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,790
you can check out how everything is set 
up,

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,130
but there's a bunch of different options
like memory.

75
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:56,250
You go to the first page and it allows 
you to work specifically on the things 

76
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,171
that you're trying to work on,
like recalling the location of objects 

77
00:04:01,171 --> 00:04:01,780
or learning new subjects quickly and 
accurately.

78
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:07,170
Then go to attention.
It has a bunch of different things that 

79
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,351
are options for attention,
concentrating while learning something 

80
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:11,170
new,
avoiding distractions and the the actual

81
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:16,171
programs are designed.
The games are designed to meet those 

82
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:17,650
specific goals.
It's really interesting.

83
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,650
It's really fun and it's really 
effective.

84
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:25,651
I've had a lot of positive feedback ever
since we started using lumosity as a 

85
00:04:25,651 --> 00:04:30,151
sponsor and it's all based on scientific
research by harnessing the brain's 

86
00:04:30,151 --> 00:04:31,720
natural ability to adapt to new 
experiences.

87
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,260
It can help with mental functions like 
memory,

88
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:36,490
attention,
mental speed,

89
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:37,810
problem solving,
etc.

90
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,940
The exercises are fun.
IT's a,

91
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:42,430
it's a really interesting thing and it's
something you get addicted to.

92
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,500
They also have apps for your phone so 
you can,

93
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,520
uh,
you can download the lumosity app and 

94
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:49,520
you know,
fuck around on the bus or,

95
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,190
or what have you.

time.
It's really something that's a,

102

human neurotransmitters and your body's

testosterone.

112
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,200
You're your body's productIon of

127
00:06:21,491 --> 00:06:22,490
faces on them,
all sculpted in,

00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:26,180
all made out of iron,
beautiful and cool and functional.

129
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:31,210
Three d mapped out so that they're all 
balanced perfectly as well as looking 

130
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,660
pretty slick,

132
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:37,980
awesome stuff on it.
Dot com,

133
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,880
o n n I t use a codename brogan.
Save yourself 10 percent.

134
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,930
Alright ladies.
Gentleman,

135
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:45,580
mike birbiglia is here.
Why waste time by fuck around.

136
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,360
We are here to the music,

137
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:52,950
the joe rogan experience podcast all 
day.

138
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Birbiglia easily the most prepared 
standup comedian gassed in the history 

139
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,160
of this podcast.
Look at this.

140
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,310
Homeboy has got page after page after 
page.

141
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,730
He also has printed stuff.
He's got it.

142
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,830
You're.
You're wriTing out in longhand,

143
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,700
so one of the last humans to use 
cursive.

144
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,580
It's all insanity though.
It doesn't add up to anything really,

145
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,860
but it does.
You know,

146
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,160
it adds up to effort,

147
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,160
right?
Like all that is making sure you're 

148
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,160
writing things down and puts it in your 
brain.

149
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,870
That's what a short documentary about 
lynch often mitch hedberg and one of the

150
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:33,830
things that he says in this old 
interview is like he got people them for

151
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,660
advice all the time,
young comedians,

152
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,200
and he just says like,
write down what's funny.

153
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,450
Don't be lazy.
Don't be lazy.

154
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,780
piece of advice.
Right.

155
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,820
Especially from a heroin addict.
It's very rare that you get like non 

156
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,910
lazy heroin addicts.
I mean,

157
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:51,530
look,
I don't make me laugh at that.

158
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,080
It's not funny,
but it is true and I think it's 

159
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,080
important to talk about because it's why
he's not with us anymore.

160
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,430
He's one of the greats.
He is,

161
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,480
in my opinion,
he is one of the most incredibly rich 

162
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,210
guys of all time.
He was so good and so clean.

163
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,620
Super clean.
yeah.

164
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,900
Which like for no reason it was so 
inventive.

165
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,610
Mind was so inventive.
Yeah.

166
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,480
He was a really unique comic,
but he also had a problem with heroin.

167
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,850
He had some drug issues,
it seemed.

168
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:21,740
I'd say that never your office.
Who am I to say?

169
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:23,540
I never.
I was friends with mitch,

170
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,850
I never saw him use drugs.
That's true.

171
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,210
Well,
I was friends with mitch and I never saw

172
00:08:28,211 --> 00:08:29,300
him use drugs either,
but,

173
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,260
and,
and um,

174
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,270
I saw him.
yeah.

175
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,650
Nice.
I'm the final week,

176
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,580
uh,
and it's just,

177
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,890
it's very sad.
Well,

178
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,160
when

179
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,500
stan hope and I were working together on
the man show,

180
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,900
the bastardized second version of the 
man show,

181
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:47,901
um,
I remember was when he got gangrene and 

182
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:48,630
I remember that in Texas.
Yeah.

183
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,220
Yeah.
He almost lost his leg and uh,

184
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,480
you know,
they came back from that and everybody 

185
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:56,670
was hoping that he was of clean up and 
get his shit together,

186
00:08:56,671 --> 00:08:59,700
but for whatever reason,
whatever,

187
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,160
you know what?
Yes,

188
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:04,080
he burned brightly and he's.
And he's gone.

189
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,750
Yeah.
What,

190
00:09:04,751 --> 00:09:08,520
what was important though about his,
his artwork?

191
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:10,940
What he did was he was so prolific,
you know,

192
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,440
and constantly and it is super 
disciplined,

193
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,800
very disciplined in his style is like a 
really difficult style to be realistic 

194
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:18,800
with.
Yeah.

195
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,900
Because it's not like weird observations
that are non sequiturs one nonsequitor 

196
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:23,900
after another.

197
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah.
I know.

198
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,120
I have this memory when it always feels 
like a blur,

199
00:09:29,121 --> 00:09:34,121
but I remember when he passed away and 
there was a memorial service like at 

200
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:37,541
carolines in New York and I was with his
standing on the street with dave attell 

201
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,160
and my wife and mitchell's mother,
mary,

202
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,840
and she's passed away now.
And,

203
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,220
and,
and,

204
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,240
uh,
dave and mary were smoking cigarettes 

205
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,370
and then dave goes,
uh,

206
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,980
and it was going to sound trite way.
I'm repeating it,

207
00:09:51,981 --> 00:09:55,580
but dave has a profound nest to him that
it kind of gets away with this.

208
00:09:55,581 --> 00:09:58,600
He was just like,
we'll always have the albums,

209
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,220
like we'll always have the albums.
And it's true.

210
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:04,220
There is something that,
that it's like we lose a lot of people,

211
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,350
but with mitch will,
we have this really special thing.

212
00:10:06,351 --> 00:10:11,351
Like we have these beautiful comedy 
albums which are like a moment in time 

213
00:10:11,351 --> 00:10:13,400
that are perfect jokes and like perfect 
wisdom.

214
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,480
The wisdom.
There's wisdom in matches comedy as far 

215
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:18,480
as I'm.

216
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:18,480
Yeah,
I agree.

217
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,170
They're just,
they're one of those things where he 

218
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:23,170
know some of his jokes are just so 
preposterous,

219
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,310
but other ones,
you know,

220
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,350
you'll,
you'll just,

221
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,010
you'll just listen to it and you just 
go,

222
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,110
you know,
what the fuck,

223
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,040
like,
like my favorite is somebody asked me if

224
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,290
I wanted a frozen banana.
I said no,

225
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,170
but I want a regular banana later.
So yes,

226
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,800
they're just,
they're just so.

227
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,750
There's so uniquely him,
you know,

228
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:45,700
and almost like,
um,

229
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:50,930
there's like a vein of that comedy that 
goes from I guess like Steven Wright 

230
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,620
know who's got that sort of absurdist,
weird way of looking at things.

231
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,110
But then mitch would take it to a 
totally new place.

232
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,330
Totally personal place

233
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,170
is this joke and I'm going to kind of 
mess it up.

234
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:02,410
But because I don't remember people's 
jokes that well,

235
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,710
but like where he goes,
ah,

236
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,590
he goes,
I said,

237
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:10,740
I said a thing and uh,
and then someone didn't hear me that 

238
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,330
well and they asked me to repeat it.
And then,

239
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:14,980
uh,
oh,

240
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,670
it's the steam boat operator joke and 
I'm forgetting the how it gets to it.

241
00:11:18,671 --> 00:11:19,900
But,
but uh,

242
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,680
but it's about being,
it's all,

243
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,380
it's ultimately about being 
misunderstood.

244
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:24,400
I feel bad.
I feel bad.

245
00:11:24,401 --> 00:11:26,860
I went down that road thinking that my 
brain,

246
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,510
maybe I need some more of these 
chemicals,

247
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,520
you dah,
dah,

248
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,320
dah,
dah.

249
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,500
What?
All of these things.

250
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:37,450
I have a fancy coffee that is super good
that you with the butter in it.

251
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,860
Yeah.
Bulletproof coffee.

252
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,920
It'S not working for me yet,
but it's early man for a comedian here 

253
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:44,890
is,
there's a,

254
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,480
there's a,
there's a joke.

255
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,200
I'm trying to find them.
If you do,

256
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,810
if you youtube steve mode operator,
you'll find that joke.

257
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,090
Yeah,
that's what I'm trying to find.

258
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,790
I got to say like,
of the things I even,

259
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,850
even like hearing you talk before we 
started talking,

260
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,930
the thing that I admire about your 
comedy and niches and like stan hope,

261
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:07,931
stan homes by favorite comeback by far.
And the reason why it's the same thing 

262
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:10,000
that you have and all the comics are 
maria bamford.

263
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,480
No one could steal their jokes.
Oh they do.

264
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,590
But you,
but you can't.

265
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,470
You can't steal them and have the other 
person wouldn't.

266
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,820
Uh,
it wouldn't go so well as well as it 

267
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:22,820
will for,
you know.

268
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:22,820
Well,
yeah,

269
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:27,511
if that's.
Isn't that the beautiful thing about 

270
00:12:27,511 --> 00:12:27,511
comedy when it comes from your 
personality,

271
00:12:27,511 --> 00:12:31,770
you know,
when like you listened to a mitch 

272
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:31,770
hedberg Joke,
you know,

273
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,200
like the double tree hotel job,
you know,

274
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:36,910
like there's he minds in a way that I,
I would never mind,

275
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,890
you know,
like he minds from material in a way,

276
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:43,840
like another good example that is patent
patent oswald get to like,

277
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,690
I look at it like I've listened to some 
of his cds and I go,

278
00:12:46,691 --> 00:12:48,580
that's a bit that I probably would have 
abandoned.

279
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:53,820
I would have started maybe working on,
tried it on stage a few times and just 

280
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,580
moved on to something with more meat to 
it.

281
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,820
But he'll take an idea that's like an 
odd idea that maybe I would have 

282
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,380
abandoned and turn it into an amazing 10
minute Chunk,

283
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,300
you know?
Yeah.

284
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:06,280
Patents totally like that.
It'll also,

285
00:13:06,281 --> 00:13:11,281
one of the things I love about patents,
he's just genuinely passionate about 

286
00:13:11,281 --> 00:13:11,640
what he's talking about.
Here it is a,

287
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:13,250
I wrote a letter to my dad.
I wrote,

288
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:18,530
I really enjoy being here,
but I accidentally wrote rarely instead 

289
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,750
of really,
but I still wanted to use it,

290
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:23,720
so I crossed it out and wrote,
I rarely drive steam boats dead.

291
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:29,710
You don't know about me.
Kind of act like I'm a steam boat 

292
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,010
operator.
Took a harsh turn right away,

293
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,580
like one of my favorite jokes of all 
time.

294
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,820
It's a perfect joke.
that was a great impression.

295
00:13:36,821 --> 00:13:41,821
By the way,
this not exactly like that's like a 

296
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:41,821
piece of philosophy I think.
Yeah,

297
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,570
just a joke.
I really do think that.

298
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,080
Well it's a piece of mitch didn't know 
that,

299
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,260
that in and tells a way of saying it.
You know,

300
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,680
we,
we still have the albums we do.

301
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:51,700
We have that.
Yeah,

302
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:56,850
we do have that.
It was one of the coolest things about 

303
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:56,850
the art form,
you know,

304
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,960
the,
the insight into how a person's mind 

305
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,020
functions and how they put together 
material that you know,

306
00:14:03,021 --> 00:14:05,500
like gaffigan,
like I don't think like the african.

307
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:06,870
Is that his writing up there?
Yeah.

308
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,610
Isn't that great?
Don't believe people believe.

309
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:14,460
Is that the documentary?
Or even themselves believe in ghosts,

310
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,270
but they don't believe in themselves.
That's a great.

311
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:18,850
We should tell people what the url is of
that site because it's a.

312
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,710
It's a you.
It's on youtube.

313
00:14:20,711 --> 00:14:24,850
This documentary.
We're lynn his widow in shock her off.

314
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,880
there's a very funny comic as well.
It's in the cabin that they shared and 

315
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,230
she takes out his notebook and she's 
showing what it was in his notebook.

316
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,150
Yeah.
And they're there.

317
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,690
Cabin was up in big bear,
right?

318
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,820
Like when he got a development deal,
you know,

319
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:38,800
some people go out and they buy a 
mercedes.

320
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,530
He boughT a cabin in big bear.
Yeah,

321
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:43,200
exactly.
Nobody's said to me,

322
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,770
what's it's funny looking at this 
notebook.

323
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,640
Mitch goes,
today,

324
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:50,641
I opened for him and the first time I 
ever featured jokers comedy club in 

325
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:50,641
dayton,
Ohio,

326
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:51,380
I know,
play and goes,

327
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:52,700
ah.
He goes,

328
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:57,701
uh,
don't ever show a girl your notebook 

329
00:14:57,701 --> 00:14:59,840
because she's not supposed to know about
it.

330
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,480
you're just supposed to see the final 
jokes onstage.

331
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,760
That's so true.
Isn't that true?

332
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,820
When you date girls and they see your 
act over and over and over again and 

333
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,410
they lose all the magic you have to meet
and marry them or break up with it.

334
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:18,590
You got to do one or the other because 
otherwise they're going to tell their 

335
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:18,590
friends.

336
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,200
He just repeats the same shit every 
night and then he gets it right.

337
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,760
It's not that big a deal.
I can do it.

338
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,280
The mystique goes away.
The mystique,

339
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,950
that mystique of writing,
but he was a.

340
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:33,440
He was such a unique guy in that he did 
obviously have issues with drugs,

341
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:38,770
but he also obviously it was really 
fucking prolific and really wrote a lot 

342
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,830
and was really disciplined.
Yeah,

343
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,920
no,
in that sense it was just an odd 

344
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:44,920
combination of things.
Yeah.

345
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:44,920
No.
Yeah,

346
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,590
absolutely.
Was.

347
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,000
He's a.
He was a phenomenon.

348
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,760
Yeah.
People should live.

349
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,650
If I.
I feel like I should almost plug this.

350
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:55,970
I was talking to mitch altogether.
Great album.

351
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:01,260
You can get an itunes or spotify or 
whatever and a and strategic grill 

352
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,080
locations was his first album.
I love that.

353
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,830
Perfect.
Strategic grill locations is an awesome,

354
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:11,980
awesome classic.
Now you've got a new album out coming 

355
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:11,980
out is.

356
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:11,980
No,
it Just came out.

357
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,160
It's,
um,

358
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,330
yeah,
it's called my girlfriend's boyfriend.

359
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:20,580
It's about a,
it's about a lot of like heartbreak and 

360
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,400
love and,
and how I decided to get married despite

361
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:24,800
the fact that I don't reallY believe in 
the idea of marriage.

362
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,390
Yeah,
it's a stupid idea,

363
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:28,400
but it works for them.
It works for women.

364
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:29,780
Women love it.
They love it.

365
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,910
They love being able to tell their 
friends are married getting.

366
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:33,140
That's what it is.
Oh yeah,

367
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,670
definitely.
They like winning.

368
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:39,850
They win and then you might get married 
when they enjoyed that.

369
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:41,510
Yeah.
My wife,

370
00:16:41,511 --> 00:16:45,020
totally one.
That's an interesting perspective.

371
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,200
I've never thought about it like that.
But uh,

372
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,870
yeah,
I'm happier though.

373
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:51,950
Are you?
Are you happy?

374
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:52,520
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

375
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,770
But it's just because I'm in a great 
relationship.

376
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,980
I would have been just as happy if I 
didn't have some shit written down on 

377
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,280
paper or wearing a little monkey ring.

378
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,370
It's all that stuff is.
It seems secondary,

379
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:08,540
but for women it means a lot that you go
through that nonsense.

380
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,060
Or for some women I should say,
I shouldn't never generalize like that.

381
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:14,180
Some of them they want that.
They want that nonsense.

382
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:19,300
They want that cultural nonsense.
They want to be able to tell their 

383
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:19,300
friends are married.
Yeah.

384
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,321
I think.
Well I think part of it's the family 

385
00:17:23,321 --> 00:17:23,321
too.
Yes.

386
00:17:23,321 --> 00:17:23,321
The families are like,
what's going on?

387
00:17:23,321 --> 00:17:26,150
Oh yeah.
Real people start to go.

388
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,170
Yeah.
I mean,

389
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:32,560
I don't know.
There's certain things that people just 

390
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,211
don't like it.
They don't believe unless it has a 

391
00:17:34,211 --> 00:17:38,111
formal cultural understanding.
LIke this is maybe a tangential example,

392
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:43,190
but like my cat passed away this summer 
and for your cap,

393
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,080
trying to figure out how you're going to
come back.

394
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,280
so like,
uh,

395
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,380
I don't know either yet,
but uh,

396
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,460
my cat I haven't passed away.

397
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,750
My wife and I were so upset like,
so like it,

398
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,950
like the whole summer was like our cat 
passed away.

399
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:57,210
That's people will be like,
what's up?

400
00:17:57,211 --> 00:17:58,050
We'd be like,
our cap.

401
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,360
I haven't passed away the whole summer.
Yeah,

402
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,510
we were really upset by it.
He was 17 years old.

403
00:18:03,511 --> 00:18:05,060
I have a 17 year old category now.
Yeah.

404
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:10,070
So like we were so,
so close to ivan and explaining that 

405
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:15,051
your cat died is a little bit like 
explaining that your imaginary friend 

406
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:16,980
died where you're like,
he ivan's dead and they're like,

407
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:19,000
write a event and you're like,
no,

408
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,530
no,
really,

409
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,810
our cad ivan,
they're like your cat.

410
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,080
And I feel like marriage is a little bit
like that too.

411
00:18:25,081 --> 00:18:27,870
You're like,
if you're not married you can be like,

412
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,230
it's my boyfriend and I love him and he 
loves me.

413
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:33,260
And they were like,
right your boyfriend?

414
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,860
And he loves you.
Yeah,

415
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,100
exactly.
If yOu're married and it's like,

416
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,600
oh,
you got the document,

417
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,880
you've got the legal well okay,
I buy it.

418
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:47,140
Yeah.
And then there's some people that they 

419
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:47,570
look at that as like there's like goals 
that they have to achieve,

420
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,400
get in a relationship.
Okay,

421
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:54,460
check now next move.
You got to get this guy to sign this 

422
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:54,650
paper.
And I hate that.

423
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,940
Yeah,
that's the part of it.

424
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:59,030
I have a friend who went through a 
fucking absolutely brutal divorce.

425
00:18:59,031 --> 00:19:00,470
I mean a really,
really bad one.

426
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,810
And then his new wife,
he,

427
00:19:02,811 --> 00:19:05,540
you know,
he started dating this woman immediately

428
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:08,090
afterwards of course,
and she didn't want to sign a prenup.

429
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,390
Yeah.
And he lost everything and you know,

430
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:13,400
and it's like I don't know what to do.
And you don't know what to do.

431
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,570
You don't know what to do.
Do you,

432
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,040
do you hate yourself?
Like,

433
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:19,040
are you fucking crazy?
Like match doesn't always work out,

434
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,410
buddy.
It doesn't always work out the prenup on

435
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:22,290
the second marriage.

436
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,660
Oh,
interesting.

437
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,380
When he lost everything on the first 
man.

438
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,530
Yes,
he lost everything on the first marriage

439
00:19:27,531 --> 00:19:31,480
and I'm pretty sure they overlapped.
Like his first marriage was fine.

440
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,940
I'd have to ask him about this.
His first marriage was falling apart and

441
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:37,550
then he met her and there was like,
you know,

442
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:42,551
he knew her while he was still with his 
wife and then he got divorced like he 

443
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:42,551
had like,
you know,

444
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:46,220
the old expression about like swinging 
from branch to branch that uh,

445
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,260
you know,
most women especially,

446
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:53,410
they don't like to let go of a branch.
They like to swing and then know that 

447
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,280
there's another branch there when they 
let go theIr first branch.

448
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,510
You don't have to say women.
You just said people.

449
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,650
Yes.
Humans.

450
00:19:58,651 --> 00:19:59,290
Humans.
Yeah.

451
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,240
But,
but like,

452
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,160
uh,
yeah.

453
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,900
The,
the,

454
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:08,930
the,
the marriage thing is weird now 

455
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,121
particularly to be in light of all of 
these supplements and things that you 

456
00:20:11,121 --> 00:20:13,020
talk about because people are just going
to live longer.

457
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,370
Well,
not with this stuff.

458
00:20:14,371 --> 00:20:19,371
I mean really,
I mean if you're lucky you get another 

459
00:20:19,371 --> 00:20:20,190
five years or 10 years.
Alpha and proteIn vitamins.

460
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:20,990
I'm like,
oh man.

461
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:24,210
What studies have been done on life 
extension as far as like vitamins?

462
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,010
Well,
a little bit.

463
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:30,230
I mean I guess all that combined with 
like hip replacements and heart 

464
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,981
transplants and all is well,
there's so much futuristic stuff right 

465
00:20:33,981 --> 00:20:34,840
now that's gonna make people live longer
and then it's going to be like,

466
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:40,220
it already was weird that we were 
married 30 years and what if I were 

467
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,040
married 70 years?

468
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,030
Well,
in that sense,

469
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:47,031
I think that if it works,
it works and if you're married for 30 

470
00:20:47,031 --> 00:20:49,390
years and you really happy and then you 
get to live for another hundred,

471
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:54,450
would you want to break up and start 
fresh with a new person and try to put 

472
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:57,811
it together?
Like part of what makes a marriage work 

473
00:20:57,811 --> 00:20:59,530
or friendship work or anything is you 
kind of understand how each other works.

474
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,260
Kind of understand what the ins and the.
Absolutely.

475
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:07,810
Yeah.
That when that happens so much 

476
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,580
theoretically in practice when it's done
perfectly,

477
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,100
which it never is,
but when it is done perfectly,

478
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,950
that's what makes it so cool is that you
know each other,

479
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,720
you know,
like you'd go to the store and like,

480
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,220
oh,
I know she loves this kind of shit.

481
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,530
I'll go to go get her this or you know,
you're going to go on a vacation.

482
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,160
She's never going to want to do this or 
she loves doing this.

483
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,420
Yeah.
You know each other.

484
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,910
So in that sense,
would it really matter if you live to be

485
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,790
an extra hundred years?
Probably not,

486
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,280
except you'd start thinking about all 
that extra pussy.

487
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:37,510
Yeah.
That age 100 pussies crazy I've heard.

488
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,880
Just gets different.
Just different.

489
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,340
It's like wine in a barrel or old 
scotch.

490
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,880
I'm going to just read.
I just want to take that back from the 

491
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:47,880
record.
I know this is live,

492
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,430
but I just want to take back that age 
100 line.

493
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,860
These are just jokes folks.
You looked at this stuff written down on

494
00:21:53,861 --> 00:21:54,460
paper.
You go,

495
00:21:54,461 --> 00:21:56,860
these guys are assholes.
Statements are these,

496
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,260
but in the moment this is great.
Yeah.

497
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,910
Seeing the moment.
It's exciting.

498
00:22:00,911 --> 00:22:03,820
I love that you have this.
Oh,

499
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:08,830
the studio.
The studio and you have your people who 

500
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,000
listen and like you don't even have to 
go.

501
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,850
I'm going on conan tonight.
You don't have to go on conan.

502
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:15,390
You don't have to go and talk just 
because you have like your.

503
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:20,400
I looked on your website.
You're playing like goddamn chicago 

504
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,530
theater,
chicago theater or what?

505
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:26,750
That is so huge.
You can't get bigger than that and 

506
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,600
you're just here in your studio being 
like,

507
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:30,220
hey guys,
I'm coming to chicago theater.

508
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,370
Yeah.
Yeah.

509
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,830
I'm coming soon.
When is that?

510
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:35,280
January 24th chicago theater.
Me and uh,

511
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,980
the great ari shaffir should.
She'll be good times.

512
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,410
Yeah.
That place is awesome res.

513
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,300
But he could close.
Ari shapiro is legit.

514
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,830
Headliner now.
Oh no,

515
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:45,870
I'm sure.
Do you know ari?

516
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,770
I think I'd do it.
Yeah,

517
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,670
yeah,
yeah.

518
00:22:48,671 --> 00:22:49,450
This thing is,
um,

519
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,010
I remember seeing him in that video 
though.

520
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,870
Carlos see a video?
Yes.

521
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,690
Yeah.
He was one of the first cars that carlos

522
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,220
ripped off back in the day when not.

523
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:02,220
I shouldn't say that.
I'm sure carl started ripping guys off 

524
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,621
way before already,
but one of the first guys that I knew 

525
00:23:04,621 --> 00:23:04,621
that like suffered from it.
Yeah.

526
00:23:04,621 --> 00:23:08,760
But yeah,
this place sort of as come together 

527
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,011
slowly but surely.
It's pretty humble becoming more and 

528
00:23:11,011 --> 00:23:12,370
more child.
Like as I add special effects pieces.

529
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,810
When I look around here,
I'm like,

530
00:23:13,811 --> 00:23:18,811
I feel like you could be.
I think you might be like a politician 

531
00:23:18,811 --> 00:23:20,070
in the future.
Do you ever get that feeling?

532
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,880
No.
Now how the fuck do you get that?

533
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,670
You look around,
you see a predator mask,

534
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,930
you see an alien had a zombie,
a lava lamp,

535
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,760
deer skull,
and you like,

536
00:23:30,761 --> 00:23:31,780
you know what,
you should be running.

537
00:23:31,781 --> 00:23:32,590
Shit,
here's what I,

538
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,660
here's what I get,
here's how I hire arrived there.

539
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,890
So,
so with jay,

540
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,960
with jfk,
you had the first president who was on 

541
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,270
camera,
he was good looking and,

542
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,240
and before that you didn't have to be 
good looking as a president.

543
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,840
That's interesting that,
that was like a big shift in culture and

544
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:54,860
they say that barack obama is the first 
president at where it's like,

545
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,980
he's like a rockstar precedent.
Like people are like,

546
00:23:57,981 --> 00:24:00,130
he's fucking cool.
Like I've,

547
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,790
you know,
like a lot of people say like,

548
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,860
people voted for him because they're 
just excited.

549
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:07,460
It's so exciting.
I'm going to take it a step further,

550
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,280
like 20 years from now,
the president.

551
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:11,180
And it's hilarious.

552
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,460
Hilarious about wanting the military 
industrial complex.

553
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:22,140
Unless some massive paradigm shift takes
place where we no longer have wore a.

554
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:25,670
I don't see anybody running any country.
Being hilarious.

555
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,040
President is hilarious and he's in a 
great shape.

556
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,430
And uh,
yeah,

557
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:35,470
that's all I got.
That's why I think you could be a 

558
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:35,470
politician in the future.
Right.

559
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,740
That's it.
Maybe the time has come because I feel 

560
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:42,161
like if you were in charge,
I would vote for you because I would 

561
00:24:42,161 --> 00:24:42,161
feel confident.
I'd be like,

562
00:24:42,161 --> 00:24:43,520
okay,
sure.

563
00:24:43,521 --> 00:24:47,880
He smoked some pot jury posts,
most smoked some pot on that.

564
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:51,890
But he's really strong,
physically strong,

565
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,630
smart,
funny.

566
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,920
I'm,
that's enough for me.

567
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,540
Reasonable,
reasonable,

568
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:58,520
reasonable.
Is I probably the most important thing.

569
00:24:58,521 --> 00:25:03,521
Anybody.
What do you think the most important 

570
00:25:03,521 --> 00:25:05,381
quality you need to govern?
I think it's probably not wanting to 

571
00:25:05,381 --> 00:25:09,191
govern.
Not wanting to be the guy that's in 

572
00:25:09,191 --> 00:25:09,191
charge.

573
00:25:09,191 --> 00:25:10,160
I think that might be one of the best 
qualities than anybody could ever have.

574
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:15,220
if you want to run things,
he should not want to be the guy who 

575
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:15,220
runs things.
Yeah,

576
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:20,080
I think so.
I think low level headed I think is a 

577
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,260
huge quality.
I mean I feel like the reason I voted 

578
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:23,870
for barack obama is like,
I just felt like,

579
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,210
okay,
he seems smart,

580
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,700
but what was the alternative?
It seems levelheaded,

581
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:32,300
dead man in a dump.
That was the alternative.

582
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,930
And so what was the alternative?
The next.

583
00:25:35,931 --> 00:25:40,010
It was a fucking mormon.
A guy who's literally believes in one of

584
00:25:40,011 --> 00:25:43,700
the most preposterous religious stories 
in the history of humanity.

585
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:49,120
And he,
his family was a part of a cult that 

586
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,540
moved to Mexico so they can have more 
wives.

587
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,890
Yeah.
You knoW that story about it?

588
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,500
Fuck his.
His,

589
00:25:54,501 --> 00:25:55,560
uh,
mitt romney,

590
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,870
mitt romney's parents.

591
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,690
They lived in Mexico.
Oh yeah.

592
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,220
I didn't even know.
He didn't know that.

593
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,620
I think I had heard about it,
but I,

594
00:26:02,621 --> 00:26:05,870
I don't know the full story.
His dad could never be president because

595
00:26:05,871 --> 00:26:08,090
his dad was born in Mexico.
Oh,

596
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,160
his dad wasn't an american citizen that 
way.

597
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,770
It wasn't born with a natural born 
citizen where,

598
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,970
you know,
mit is.

599
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:19,150
He was born in America,
but his family comes from this sect of 

600
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:23,111
mormonism that broke off from the United
States back in the 18 hundreds when it 

601
00:26:23,111 --> 00:26:24,710
really didn't matter if he lived in.
He can live in Mexico.

602
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,420
you live in America.
It doesn't matter.

603
00:26:26,421 --> 00:26:28,190
There's no cars.
So that's what they did.

604
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:33,220
They moved to Mexico.
Shit didn't turn out so good for that 

605
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:33,250
bet.
That bet suck.

606
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,580
Like the bet that.
Well,

607
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:39,581
it's nice down here.
It's pretty much the same as it is in 

608
00:26:39,581 --> 00:26:41,471
America.
We're just going to go over here and 

609
00:26:41,471 --> 00:26:42,791
have 10 wives.
Well obviously when the invention of 

610
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:44,100
cars came along and the whole

611
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:48,580
age of machines in the industrial era 
machines and you know,

612
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:53,690
the United States became this superpower
and Mexico became what it is today and 

613
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:58,281
now they're involved in these,
these armed standoffs with the mexican 

614
00:26:58,281 --> 00:26:59,790
drug cartels.
They get kidnapped,

615
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:05,030
they have a fortified compounds and they
have centuries and snipers and rifles 

616
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:06,060
and everything.
I mean,

617
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,740
it's really crazy.
Crazy shit.

618
00:27:07,741 --> 00:27:11,280
Vice did a piece on that on the,
uh,

619
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:14,070
the varIous mormon families that are 
living in.

620
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,550
But that was our other option or other 
option was one of those guys,

621
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:23,180
a guy who believes in magic underwear 
and a fucking con artist of who was 14 

622
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:28,761
years old who Claimed the found golden 
tablets that contained the last work of 

623
00:27:28,761 --> 00:27:33,030
jesus and that the american indians were
a tribe of Israel lights that came over.

624
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,170
I mean,
it's just,

625
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,500
that's a great book if people want to 
know about mormonism at all,

626
00:27:37,501 --> 00:27:38,630
is under the banner of heaven.

627
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,180
No good scrapbook.
yeah.

628
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,790
Did you see the book of mormon krakauer 
wrote it?

629
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:45,730
Yeah.
Um,

630
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,000
the uh,
book of mormon is great.

631
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:49,730
I twice.
It's fucking amazing.

632
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,270
So good.
You know,

633
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:53,630
the crazy thing is mormons.
Mormons,

634
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:58,270
like when you get the playbill 
advertising advertisement.

635
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,350
Yes.
Yeah.

636
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,900
For the.
That is so great.

637
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,150
Yeah.
Yeah.

638
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:04,500
Now you've seen the play could come find
out,

639
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:06,690
would be in a mormon is really all about
like they think they're going to like,

640
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:11,980
like people go to like go watch that 
hilarious parody of what their religion 

641
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:16,461
is all about.
I think that maybe I'm taking it too 

642
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:20,151
far,
but I feel like matt and trey are the 

643
00:28:20,151 --> 00:28:22,461
closest to twain that we have where it's
like what they're doing is brilliant 

644
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:28,041
satire.
It's completely over the top and insane 

645
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,510
and perfectly written and they're 
fucking gangsters.

646
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,640
They get away with the craziest shit on 
tv.

647
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:37,670
it's not.
Did you ever see the sloughed off with 

648
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:38,040
paris hilton,
paris hilton and the gay guy who was the

649
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:43,041
teacher?
And the gay guy wins because he stuffs 

650
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:43,041
paris hilton up his ass.
man,

651
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:47,150
he's stuffed her up.
They can get away with so much because 

652
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:47,980
they're cartoons I know.
And they take on like,

653
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,990
like the idea of drawing.
Muhammad muhammad was teddy bear.

654
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:55,140
I saw that episode.
they take on things.

655
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,420
Where is this?
The sloughed off.

656
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,950
Watch this.
He shoves it up his ass.

657
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:07,400
He jumped on her in a gay cowboy outfit 
all with the big mustache and shoved her

658
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:12,310
up his ass.
I mean.

659
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:19,820
And then they cheer the kanye west gay 
fish one with the kanye west and carlos 

660
00:29:20,281 --> 00:29:25,281
mencia episodes.
It's one of the greatest take downs and 

661
00:29:25,281 --> 00:29:27,420
like a history of kind of stuff is too 
good of,

662
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,550
of,
of a pop culture.

663
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,480
Yeah.
That's amazing.

664
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:36,170
Yeah.
that's what it honestly intimidates me 

665
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,140
about los angeles is like matt and trey 
are here,

666
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,480
you know,
like these people who I admire so much.

667
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,100
They just all live here in this area and

668
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,150
I.
It's too much for me.

669
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:44,150
I live in New York.
I just,

670
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,610
I like being away from it,
like intimidates you.

671
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:53,990
I feel like like I don't want to,
it's almost like I don't want to see 

672
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:58,830
baton.
Trey lIke eating at a restaurant or 

673
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:58,830
something.
Like I don't why?

674
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,880
I don't want to think the real.
I don't want to think that they're 

675
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,620
mortal or something like it's too.
It's I like,

676
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:07,860
I love the mystique of show business.
So you like being in New York because 

677
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,320
you're outside of it.
I live in brooklyn.

678
00:30:08,321 --> 00:30:13,321
I don't.
I'm not part of the show business 

679
00:30:13,321 --> 00:30:13,321
really.
That's interesting.

680
00:30:13,321 --> 00:30:14,720
You're here on the joe rogan experience 
podcast to promote your new comedy cd.

681
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:19,780
Right.
Yet you claim to not be in show 

682
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:19,780
business.
What do you do?

683
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:19,780

Professional traveler.

I always say to them that traveling 
salesman,

690
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:35,700
I sell comedy.
I get paid to fly and performed for 

691
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,390

00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,840
I've announced 30.
What are the obscure places?

712
00:31:17,841 --> 00:31:19,660
Because they go to fargo.
Oh yeah.

713
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:21,520
Here you go.
Go to fargo or minneapolis.

714
00:31:21,521 --> 00:31:22,900
I'm going to traverse city,
Michigan,

715
00:31:22,901 --> 00:31:24,880
east,
lansing fargo,

716
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,730
minneapolis,
minneapolis,

717
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:33,400
minneapolis is not obscure now.
Now I guess you know,

718
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,110
but like eugene,
Oregon,

719
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:38,180
that's obscure ones.
Pretty obscure hippy place.

720
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:43,210
Lotta,
lotta like petrouli people in that 

721
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:43,210
audience.
I was in New York.

722
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,380
That's kind of obscure,
obscure as fuck.

723
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,250
Where do you play there?
Uh,

724
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,510
there's no place to play.
Go to some dude's house.

725
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:54,530
I mean,
I'm going to charleston charleston's 

726
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:54,530
kinda.
Well that's kind of a name though.

727
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:57,730
I think I could name 100 different 
cities.

728
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,160
I mean I probably could if you sat me 
down.

729
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,390
Yeah.
Someone put a blank map in front of you.

730
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,060
You get it.
Kentucky.

731
00:32:04,061 --> 00:32:05,320
Huh?
Doing a little Kentucky.

732
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:10,830
Kentucky.
Louisville is fun and then it was a 

733
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:10,830
great town.
It's a great town.

734
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,620
Here's the thing I've found about 
traveling around America.

735
00:32:11,621 --> 00:32:16,621
I'm sure you've probably found this.
A lot of great little towns will also 

736
00:32:16,621 --> 00:32:20,370
mike birbiglia fans.
they know who you are that I'm going to 

737
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:20,370
show up.
They're in a good mood.

738
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:20,620
Yeah.
they're already.

739
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,760
They're already familiar with you.
You know,

740
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,240
like you go to like boise,
Idaho.

741
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:25,630
It's like,
oh,

742
00:32:25,631 --> 00:32:30,631
this is a nice town.
Boise's great people make fun of these 

743
00:32:30,631 --> 00:32:30,631
towns.
And then you go there.

744
00:32:30,631 --> 00:32:30,631
You're like,
oh no,

745
00:32:30,631 --> 00:32:34,060
there's like five grade breakfast spots.
You know what I mean?

746
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:39,360
By the way,
might be a better place to live and it 

747
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:39,360
might be a bad place to live.
Yeah.

748
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:39,980
That's tension.
Less stress.

749
00:32:39,981 --> 00:32:44,981
Less traffic.
That's the one thing that stupid About 

750
00:32:44,981 --> 00:32:46,370
la is the massive humans all gathered 
into one place.

751
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:51,390
It's insane.
It's a great place to have a podcast 

752
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:51,390
because you could always get guests,
you know,

753
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:55,631
there's always people here,
but as far as like having sanity and 

754
00:32:55,631 --> 00:32:57,580
having peace and clarity,
this is not the best bot.

755
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,180
What's in santa barbara?
Coffee.

756
00:32:59,181 --> 00:33:01,550
Try this nurse.
Do you like anything sweet?

757
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:02,900
I'll try that.
It's just stevia.

758
00:33:02,901 --> 00:33:05,240
It's super strong.
It's a natural sweetener.

759
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,280
Only put a little bit in.
Okay.

760
00:33:07,281 --> 00:33:12,281
So it's very powerful.
I already had butter in the coffee so I 

761
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:16,840
feel like it's covered dishes,
but like los angeles is crazy because 

762
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,371
like coming here for example,
I just google map everything on the way 

763
00:33:20,371 --> 00:33:23,210
and then it's like it'll be like A,
it's 26 miles and then for time it'll be

764
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:25,370
like,
it might take days.

765
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:32,860
That's no joke either.
You can get stuck in bumper to bumper 

766
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,741
traffic,
a tukul just a little dash of that 

767
00:33:35,741 --> 00:33:35,741
stuff.
Don't fuck around.

768
00:33:35,741 --> 00:33:36,890
Don't get crazy crazy.
My grandma trying not to just throw in a

769
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:41,891
little stevia in there.
Just that little bit more of that get a 

770
00:33:41,891 --> 00:33:42,040
little crazy.
They go,

771
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,600
stop right there.
It's amazing.

772
00:33:44,601 --> 00:33:46,490
It's really strong stuff.
But this,

773
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,220
this sounds crazy.
It's uh,

774
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,800
it just,
it feels dangerous.

775
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:56,180
It feels like I'm in at risk of being in
a car accident at any moment.

776
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,310
well,
you're at west wintertime.

777
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,780
You're in a car,
you know the,

778
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,340
the.
It's an amazing really.

779
00:34:01,341 --> 00:34:03,280
When you stop thinking about it really 
good by the great,

780
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:03,890
right?
Yeah.

781
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,850
It's amazing when you to think about how
few car accidents there actually are the

782
00:34:07,851 --> 00:34:11,000
ones in my special,
which I hope you'll watch,

783
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:11,840
but I watch it.

784
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,330
I'm very proud of.
I say I hope.

785
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:17,970
Well,
there's no need for hope's.

786
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,310
Okay.
So I get.

787
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:24,460
I talk about how I was hit by a car in 
los angeles and then that was made to 

788
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,180
pay for the drunk driver's car.
Really drunk driver.

789
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,610
I was made to pay for his cars.
His written maddening.

790
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:32,510
How you made to pay for his car.
He technically had the right away.

791
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,170
I was turning right.
He was speeding around a blind corner.

792
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,560
He technically had the right away.
And then by the time he got to the 

793
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,771
hospital,
he blew under the legal limit once in a 

794
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:49,860
while.
So I wanted to take before you get paid 

795
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:49,860
$12,000
for his car,

796
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,780
like a couple hours later.
Wow.

797
00:34:50,781 --> 00:34:53,420
That's hilarious.
Now I don't test them right away.

798
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,550
Nope.
In this instance,

799
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,030
no.
And then.

800
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:01,300
And so the thematic really what it's 
about is about how like I couldn't let 

801
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:01,300
go of it.

802
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,020
Like it sounds like you have this from,
you know,

803
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:08,050
when I listened to you on the podcast,
like certain times you're obsessed with 

804
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,710
being right about something.
And I couldn't let this go.

805
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,290
I like,
it was kinda like this with the papers,

806
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:15,030
it's like I have charts and graphs and I
was like,

807
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:20,320
I was like,
and this is and this is the accident 

808
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:20,960
report and this is the map is the google
map of the scene of the accident.

809
00:35:20,961 --> 00:35:25,961
And it was,
it was 60 feet from here to the stop 

810
00:35:25,961 --> 00:35:28,121
sign and the speed limit was 35 and it 
was in his matt onstage with like lenny 

811
00:35:28,121 --> 00:35:30,140
bruce at the end of his career when he 
would go on with legal document.

812
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:35,150
You'll,
you'll see in this special I project to 

813
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:35,150
the accident report.
The actual report.

814
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,170
Yeah.
It's bonkers.

815
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,010
Yeah.
I project the extra part in the show.

816
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:43,200
It's great.
It's so the guy was drunk.

817
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,890
He,
but he technically had the right away.

818
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,060
I'm trying to figure it out in my mind.
You were going around a blind corner and

819
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,910
coming around blind corners.
he was coming around,

820
00:35:49,911 --> 00:35:53,130
we're speeding around a blind corner on 
venice beach.

821
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:58,640
And you pulled into the trap.
I pulled into a,

822
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:03,060
into a road and then he t boned me 
driver's side.

823
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,770
Wow.
and then.

824
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,130
And then I spun around and then he,
um,

825
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:12,590
drove away,
took a right turn at the intersection,

826
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:17,750
tried to speed away,
but he was so drunk he drove into a 

827
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,971
tree.
So it was like a hit and run and hit and

828
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,040
still didn't get in trouble for that.
Yeah.

829
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,470
That's saying,
I talked to lawyers,

830
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,870
I talked to private investigators.
They were just like,

831
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:33,200
dude,
it's going to cost you more in legal 

832
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:33,200
fees to fight this.

833
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:33,200
You know?
I was like,

834
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,461
I'm going to sue this guy and I'm going 
to sue the los angeles police 

835
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:37,461
department.
Like I was like,

836
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:38,270
chinatown,
chinatown.

837
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,670
It was maddening.
Well,

838
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,290
in the effort to protect people's 
rights,

839
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,880
things get kind of squirrely.
Yeah,

840
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,320
I'm all for protecting people's rights,
but I think that once you start driving 

841
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:56,061
intoxicated and slamming into people 
like they need to figure out who's drunk

842
00:36:56,191 --> 00:37:01,191
right away after an accident,
you can't let people go all the way to 

843
00:37:01,191 --> 00:37:01,191
the hospital again.
Fine.

844
00:37:01,191 --> 00:37:05,691
You need that.
That's something that needs to be dealt 

845
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:05,691
with on the spot,
but the question is,

846
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:07,140
who's going to be the guy who deals with
it?

847
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:12,141
It's going to be some knucklehead police
officer that's we're going to hold you 

848
00:37:12,141 --> 00:37:12,141
down,
tase you,

849
00:37:12,141 --> 00:37:12,690
and then take your blood.
I mean,

850
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,850
how do they,
how do they get it?

851
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,050
They got to have blood,
right?

852
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:21,090
Don't they have to take.
They can test your blood alcohol 

853
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:21,870
content.
They do the breathalyzer thing,

854
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:23,040
right.
But yeah,

855
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,930
the most accurate ways his blood and 
that's way you could.

856
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,750
We could be on pills too.
Yeah,

857
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,100
that's true.
That's true.

858
00:37:29,101 --> 00:37:29,970
He could be on drugs.
Yeah,

859
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,300
it,
when I went,

860
00:37:31,301 --> 00:37:33,150
I went to the hospital just to make sure
I was okay.

861
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:38,151
I went to the emergency room and they 
saw him first because he was a more 

862
00:37:38,151 --> 00:37:38,151
urgent case.
I don't know what had happened to him,

863
00:37:38,151 --> 00:37:39,030
but I fucking tree.
That's.

864
00:37:39,031 --> 00:37:39,750
Yeah,
exactly.

865
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,360
And I said to the doctor,
I was like,

866
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:44,850
was the other guy drunk?
and the doctor says,

867
00:37:44,851 --> 00:37:45,360
well,
you know,

868
00:37:45,361 --> 00:37:47,150
I can't answer that.
This is the same doctor.

869
00:37:47,151 --> 00:37:48,900
So both of us.
And I was like,

870
00:37:48,901 --> 00:37:49,560
well,
was he,

871
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:50,580
you know,
and uh,

872
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,990
and he goes,
well,

873
00:37:51,991 --> 00:37:53,310
he's heading the jail now.

874
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,570
And uh,
and at the time I was like,

875
00:37:54,571 --> 00:37:55,560
case closed,
you know,

876
00:37:55,561 --> 00:37:58,140
like I thought like I was like,
I was like,

877
00:37:58,141 --> 00:37:59,400
oh,
this isn't going to be an issue.

878
00:37:59,401 --> 00:38:02,610
And then a couple of months later I get 
the bill for his car.

879
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,340
It was maddening.
That's so crazy.

880
00:38:05,341 --> 00:38:06,630
Who's this asshole?
What's his name?

881
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:12,030
I can't say,
fuck this guy,

882
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,010
I am.
I considered,

883
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:19,180
I don't saY this in the show,
but if there were certain points I 

884
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:19,180
considered,
I had his phone number,

885
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:23,270
it was on the accident report.
I consider just calling him and being 

886
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:26,181
like,
you should know that you are ruining my 

887
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:26,181
life.
Hmm.

888
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:30,800
Well,
I think that's been a little bit 

889
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:30,800
dramatic for isn't really ruining your 
life.

890
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,070
It was just making you crazy,
but the fact that you have to pay for 

891
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:34,800
them or let's be honest,
I'm just saying that's how I felt.

892
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,610
A couple of a couple of jokes and that 
taken care of.

893
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,430
you're in a very fortunate position in 
life.

894
00:38:42,431 --> 00:38:44,770
Maybe you should cut your losses.
Thanks joe.

895
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:49,930
But you got comedy acts,
this 2020 insight hindsight.

896
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,760
Yeah.
It's really easy reflection.

897
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,440
I would have went to his house and 
kicked his ass.

898
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:58,650
Locked up in jail.
You the least.

899
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,610
She got comedy out of it though,
right?

900
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:01,690
I mean,
I feel great.

901
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:05,170
I mean honestly the comedy is everything
to me.

902
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:05,940
I.
That's why.

903
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,450
Thank you.
But thank god for jokes.

904
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:11,740
Tore my new show that I'm developing is 
actually all about how to like jokes are

905
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,360
in a certain way.
My religion,

906
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:18,510
like they're there.
They're the philosophy that I believe 

907
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:21,991
in.
I believe life iS hard and then we make 

908
00:39:21,991 --> 00:39:23,170
jokes about it because it's all we can 
do and it makes it more fun.

909
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,970
Yeah.
Still to this day,

910
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:26,950
stand up comedy is one of my favorite 
things to watch.

911
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:32,100
I still enjoy it very much as an 
audience member and if someone told me 

912
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,580
that I could never perform comedy for 
the rest of my life for some strange 

913
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:35,580
reason,
but I could still watch it.

914
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,190
I was still love watching it.
Yeah,

915
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:39,970
it's great man.
I thought stan hope specialists year.

916
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,370
The beer hall push I think is how you 
pronounce it.

917
00:39:42,371 --> 00:39:47,371
Yeah.
That was like one of the best comedy 

918
00:39:47,371 --> 00:39:47,371
specials I've ever seen.
It was a really good one.

919
00:39:47,371 --> 00:39:51,200
That was my wife and I were just like,
it was like a euphoric experience that 

920
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:51,370
you have is watching it.
Yeah.

921
00:39:51,371 --> 00:39:53,350
He's uh,
he's working hard man.

922
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:56,010
And one of the things that stand helps 
doing is he's like,

923
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,970
really?
He is that guy.

924
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,090
He lives in the desert.
He lives in this weird fucking town,

925
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,940
Arizona.
That's base bisbee,

926
00:40:03,941 --> 00:40:06,310
Arizona.
Seven miles from the mexican border.

927
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:10,010
He invites people over to his house for 
a,

928
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,670
for superbowl parties.
I know he's a nut.

929
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,200
I mean,
he's a legit nut.

930
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,020
He's a great guy too.
He's really.

931
00:40:17,021 --> 00:40:19,600
He's really like,
come into his own as an artist,

932
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:24,900
as a standup comedian.
That special is if there are any 

933
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,550
aspiring comedians listening or 
watching.

934
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,600
See that special before turning the gun 
on himself as a great one too.

935
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:34,420
He's got a bunch of great ones.
He's got lots of good stuff.

936
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:36,790
This is the one where he talks about 
letting his mother go.

937
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,840
Yeah.
Yeah.

938
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:40,070
That's an incredible story.
Yeah.

939
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,680
Yeah.
It's good stuff,

940
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,720
man.
I couldn't live in bisbee,

941
00:40:43,721 --> 00:40:45,490
Arizona.
I don't know what the fuck is thinking.

942
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,480
He's just very strange.
I don't know how to describe what that 

943
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,640
man.
He's got a great joke about lIving there

944
00:40:54,641 --> 00:40:57,100
too though.
The idea of it being an artist community

945
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:00,350
and the difference between how his art 
and there are.

946
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:05,370
It doesn't really go together.
They make turquoise belt buckles and 

947
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,520
he's making a joke about tsunami 
victims,

948
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:11,550
about how the the drowned japanese,
they start to swell and they take on 

949
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:15,010
this korean look and I'm really 
butchering the pit,

950
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:18,580
but it's fucking hilarious.
It's comparison between his art,

951
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:22,680
what he considers art and what they 
consider art artists community.

952
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,720
You know,
one of the things I love about him is 

953
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,960
hilt keeps twisting the knife and 
different directions.

954
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:33,990
Yeah.
Like he'll take you one way and you'll 

955
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:33,990
be like,
ooh,

956
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:36,661
I don't know if I could go there and 
then he'll take you back farther in the 

957
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:36,980
other direction farther,
right.

958
00:41:36,981 --> 00:41:41,981
Than you could think you get go and then
I'll pull you farther left than you 

959
00:41:41,981 --> 00:41:41,981
thought.
You know what I mean?

960
00:41:41,981 --> 00:41:42,830
Like he just always has you on your 
toes.

961
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,780
He works,
you know that dude.

962
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,550
You see him sitting there smoking a 
cigarette,

963
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:48,500
drinking coffee,
banging away on the keyboard,

964
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,060
you know?
And that is a,

965
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,250
like you said,
you know what you're saying,

966
00:41:52,251 --> 00:41:54,270
that jokes or your religion.
Yeah.

967
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:58,220
That the discipline of creation is 
really what it's all about.

968
00:41:58,221 --> 00:42:01,130
Whether you're writing books,
whether you're writing jokes,

969
00:42:01,131 --> 00:42:02,650
whether you're creating music,
whatever.

970
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,870
I admire the discipline involved and 
creating things.

971
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,640
Anything,
podcasts,

972
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:08,780
music,
movies,

973
00:42:08,781 --> 00:42:12,620
whatever the fuck you're making.
Matt and trey making south park and also

974
00:42:12,621 --> 00:42:15,770
having some strange amount of time to 
make the book of mormon as well.

975
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,730
You see that documentary about matt and 
trey from south park is great nuts.

976
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:21,110
People should watch this on netflix.
It's called like 60,

977
00:42:21,111 --> 00:42:23,540
60 seconds.
The air or something like that.

978
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,940
What is it?
Sixty minutes to air.

979
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,060
Six days to say area.
Super good.

980
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:29,870
Yeah.
It's amazing.

981
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,540
It's for instance,
inspirational too and you realize what a

982
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:33,530
bad mother fucker that.

983
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:36,700
Well both of them but yeah,
but trey bad motherfucker.

984
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,420
Yeah.
That guy's not nonstop.

985
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:39,380
Yeah,
he's just a nut,

986
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:42,650
but I think he obviously gets off on it.
I mean that's his thing.

987
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:47,810
He loves creating that fucking show and 
that show such a perfect vehicle to.

988
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:52,840
Because by doing little cartoon kids 
that don't look anything like reality 

989
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,901
now and then also having them be kids.
So there's like a certain mount of 

990
00:42:56,901 --> 00:42:59,871
ignorance you can get away with a child,
sort of beautiful vehicle for creating 

991
00:43:00,741 --> 00:43:05,390
comedy when you write like all this shit
that you've got in front of you here.

992
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,750
Whereby do I feel heat?
Where's he coming from?

993
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,990
Space heater.
Oh,

994
00:43:08,991 --> 00:43:10,660
that's what it is.
I was like,

995
00:43:10,661 --> 00:43:12,080
man,
I know it heats broken.

996
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,600
You have to get someone to climb on the 
roof,

997
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:19,490
turn her fucking pilot light on.
How retarded is up when you write,

998
00:43:19,491 --> 00:43:22,070
do you sit down and go,
okay,

999
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:25,250
today I'm going to write from 8:00
AM to 10:00

1000
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:25,650
AM or what?

1001
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,570
I mean,
how do you do it?

1002
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,320
I build it from like,
like it's like I built.

1003
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:33,320
I brainstorm stories.
So like I'll like,

1004
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:38,321
I'll talk to my brother joe who co 
writes a lot of stuff with me and we'll 

1005
00:43:38,321 --> 00:43:39,020
just talk.
Like one time this happened to me,

1006
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:44,080
one time this happened to me.
One time this happened to me and we'll 

1007
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:44,080
talk about on the phone for like a 
couple hours,

1008
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,250
you know,
and then we'll talk about which,

1009
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:50,000
which ones are good enough stories that 
are worth telling.

1010
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:51,920
And then,
uh,

1011
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:55,730
and then I'll,
and then I'll go out and try it on stage

1012
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:00,840
and I'll record it and I'll go back and 
transcribe what I said and then I'll 

1013
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:04,100
edit from that transcription.
That's interesting.

1014
00:44:04,101 --> 00:44:06,050
So you,
you cowrite with your brother.

1015
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,080
How long have you been doing that for?
Ten years.

1016
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,970
Does your brother to stand up at all 
now?

1017
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:13,340
He tried.
He,

1018
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:17,440
he doesn't like it at stage,
but he enjoys the creative process.

1019
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:22,450
Is writing super funny guy and uh,
but he doesn't like being onstage.

1020
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,920
What does he do for a living?
He works for me.

1021
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:27,890
Oh really?
So he's a writer for you?

1022
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:29,090
Yeah,
writer,

1023
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:30,140
producer,
producer,

1024
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,890
cowrote.
My movie sleepwalk with me.

1025
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,400
Oh,
that's so cool.

1026
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:38,810
Yeah,
the sleepwalk with me was really 

1027
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:38,810
interesting for folks.
Don't know mike,

1028
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:39,030
uh,
for folks that don't know,

1029
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,730
mike is your,
you're a sleepwalker.

1030
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:42,900
Yeah,
I jumped,

1031
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:47,950
I dangerously,
I jumped through a second story window 

1032
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:47,950
nicely.
Yeah.

1033
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:52,100
And uh,
you talked about that on the podcast 

1034
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,030
last time you were here.
And that movie is sort of based on that,

1035
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:58,140
on how weird that thing must be to have 
that in you.

1036
00:44:58,141 --> 00:45:03,141
The ability to just get up and start 
doing things while you're actually 

1037
00:45:03,141 --> 00:45:03,141
asleep.
Yeah,

1038
00:45:03,141 --> 00:45:03,500
it's.
Yeah.

1039
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:04,040
It's.
And it's.

1040
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:09,070
And I still deal with it.
I sleep in a sleeping bag to this very 

1041
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:09,070
day.
I go to bed and I asleep and asleep.

1042
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,490
Give,
bring a sleeping bag when you go,

1043
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:14,340
like camping when you go to tyler road.
Yeah,

1044
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:16,100
exactly.
They're camping when I met her.

1045
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:19,020
Zip yourself up so you can't get up 
myself up.

1046
00:45:19,021 --> 00:45:21,360
I used to wear mittens so I couldn't 
open the sleeping bag.

1047
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:28,170
The doctor told me the strangest things 
that doctor has ever told me.

1048
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:33,530
He goes,
I want you to go to bed at night and a 

1049
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:34,320
sleeping bag and sleep,
zip yourself up and then wear mittens so

1050
00:45:34,321 --> 00:45:36,270
you can't open the sleeping bag,
a doctor.

1051
00:45:36,271 --> 00:45:37,370
So that to me,
strange.

1052
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:42,380
Wow.
Well this is after he jumped out the 

1053
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:42,380
window.
Yeah,

1054
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:42,570
he was just,
he was a woman actually,

1055
00:45:42,571 --> 00:45:43,890
that my doctor now is a male.
But,

1056
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,260
uh,
it was,

1057
00:45:45,261 --> 00:45:45,790
uh,
yeah,

1058
00:45:45,791 --> 00:45:46,650
she,
she was just like,

1059
00:45:46,651 --> 00:45:48,480
I'm not sure what to tell you.
In the meantime,

1060
00:45:48,481 --> 00:45:51,330
just do this with what floor do you live
on in New York?

1061
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:54,270
We live on my bedroom's on the second 
floor,

1062
00:45:54,271 --> 00:45:59,271
but we have these really super 
reinforced shutters that we put in that 

1063
00:45:59,271 --> 00:46:00,330
are pretty expensive just to keep you 
from jumping through the window.

1064
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,240
Yeah,
yeah.

1065
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:03,050
It was strange.

1066
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:07,040
I know.
Yeah.

1067
00:46:07,041 --> 00:46:09,090
You don't want to jump on the second 
floor in manhattan.

1068
00:46:09,091 --> 00:46:10,100
Where did you jump?
No,

1069
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:11,130
in brooklyn.
Um,

1070
00:46:11,131 --> 00:46:14,820
I jumped through the second story window
of la quinta inn in walla walla,

1071
00:46:14,821 --> 00:46:16,530
Washington.
As a matter of fact,

1072
00:46:16,531 --> 00:46:21,531
there's a plaque if you might be able to
google this laquinta inn birbiglia 

1073
00:46:21,531 --> 00:46:26,181
plaque while back.
There's a plaque on the door of the 

1074
00:46:26,181 --> 00:46:28,110
room,
why birbiglia jumped through this window

1075
00:46:28,111 --> 00:46:31,510
and there was a movie based on it.
And it's like,

1076
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:36,570
because you're here and you're fine if 
you died then,

1077
00:46:36,571 --> 00:46:37,830
you know.
Yeah.

1078
00:46:37,831 --> 00:46:42,831
It's um,
ira glass who wrote the movie and 

1079
00:46:42,831 --> 00:46:45,891
produced the movie with me,
hosted this american life on public 

1080
00:46:45,891 --> 00:46:45,891
media.
He,

1081
00:46:45,891 --> 00:46:50,211
um,
he was insistent that we get the plaque 

1082
00:46:50,211 --> 00:46:51,570
put up that it was like he didn't care 
about like oscars or golden gloves.

1083
00:46:51,571 --> 00:46:56,571
He was just like here,
like the out the plaque and ruined 

1084
00:46:56,571 --> 00:46:59,720
january 26,
2005 comedian mike birbiglia sleep 

1085
00:46:59,720 --> 00:46:59,720
walked out the window.

1086
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,590
That story became the basis for the book
of the feature film.

1087
00:47:01,591 --> 00:47:03,850
Sleepwalk with me.
Seriously google it.

1088
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,880
It was not great.
What a weird world we live in that.

1089
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,070
That's a plaque.
Seriously.

1090
00:47:08,071 --> 00:47:09,730
Google it is on the plaque.
Yeah.

1091
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:15,050
Wow.
Ira was really intent on getting a 

1092
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:15,050
plaque on the room.
He was like,

1093
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:16,620
that was everything to him.
He was like,

1094
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,600
where's the plaque?
Is the plaque up yet?

1095
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,120
It was like six months after I sent it 
to them.

1096
00:47:21,121 --> 00:47:24,450
And so that's on the door.
Just as your walking by.

1097
00:47:24,451 --> 00:47:29,451
That's on the door.
People sometimes will go to that 

1098
00:47:29,451 --> 00:47:31,311
laquinta inn.
They'll take photos in front of it and 

1099
00:47:31,311 --> 00:47:31,311
then tweet it.
Yeah.

1100
00:47:31,311 --> 00:47:31,340
That's awesome.
Oh,

1101
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,210
but you get a lot more now.
That's hilarious.

1102
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,650
That's really fucking fun.
Well,

1103
00:47:35,651 --> 00:47:38,500
it's hilarious again,
because you're okay now when you,

1104
00:47:38,501 --> 00:47:41,740
when you jumped through the wall,
like when you jumped out the window,

1105
00:47:41,741 --> 00:47:45,360
the window through the window shattered.
Oh,

1106
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,860
jump through.
And I have in the movie,

1107
00:47:47,861 --> 00:47:50,540
in the final credits,
there's actual photo

1108
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:52,820
graphs of after I jumped through the 
window,

1109
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:58,120
I photographed it like it was a crime 
scene because I was alone in walla 

1110
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:58,120
walla,
Washington,

1111
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,200
and I was like,
nobody's going to believe me.

1112
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:00,830
Right,
right,

1113
00:48:00,831 --> 00:48:02,330
right.
Did the hospital all this stuff.

1114
00:48:02,331 --> 00:48:04,550
But I was like,
this is too crazy of a story.

1115
00:48:04,551 --> 00:48:07,250
I need to photograph everything.
So it's all in the credits.

1116
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:10,010
How did you get through that without 
even getting really badly hurt?

1117
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:14,660
Be the same reason that a lot times of 
drunk drivers aren't hurt.

1118
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,240
They're the ones not injured.
You know what I mean?

1119
00:48:17,241 --> 00:48:19,490
When they get in car accidents because 
they're so relaxed,

1120
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,950
so relaxed.
That's so crazy.

1121
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:24,730
The idea that tension is what hurts you.
I dreamt.

1122
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:29,740
I dreamt that I was being,
that there was a guided missile headed 

1123
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:33,311
towards my hotel room.
There's all this military personnel in 

1124
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:33,320
the room with me and the missile.
Could they,

1125
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:38,370
the,
they told me that missile coordinates 

1126
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:40,001
are set specifically on me and so I 
thought the only thing I could do is 

1127
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:43,571
jump out the window so as to detonate 
outside the window for the sake of my 

1128
00:48:43,571 --> 00:48:43,571
platoon.

1129
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Wow.
What are you are a hero in your crazy 

1130
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,000
story?
I know head.

1131
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,550
Wow.
That's.

1132
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:51,170
Fuck.
Now,

1133
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:52,730
what was the extent of your injuries?

1134
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:58,720
I just had,
I still have scars on my legs and there 

1135
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,070
was glass in my legs and they took out 
the glass and uh,

1136
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:05,390
and my arms were all cut up and I had 
about 30 stitches.

1137
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:06,860
That's nothing.
It's nothing.

1138
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:08,330
It's nothing compared to what it could 
have been.

1139
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:13,360
Wow.
And what's wild is I actually jumped 

1140
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,070
through the window and landed and then 
got up and kept running.

1141
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,600
So you were still asleep?
Yeah.

1142
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,570
Wow.
As I'm running

1143
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:25,280
running,
I'm looking around and realizing like,

1144
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:30,310
oh,
I just jumped through a window in walla 

1145
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:30,310
walla,
Washington,

1146
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:30,860
and I was like,
oh no.

1147
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,920
And I was like,
I guess I got to go to the front desk 

1148
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:35,920
and explain what happened.
Oh my god,

1149
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,790
this is a funny addendum to the story.
I feel bad for my fans.

1150
00:49:40,791 --> 00:49:45,791
Your fans.
Maybe maybe you have seen the movie and 

1151
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:45,791
maybe having my fans have heard this a 
zillion times.

1152
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:50,411
I feel bad,
but I'll give you an addendum to the 

1153
00:49:50,411 --> 00:49:50,411
story which is new,
which is.

1154
00:49:50,411 --> 00:49:52,820
I always say that I walked to the front 
desk to explain what happened.

1155
00:49:52,821 --> 00:49:54,620
Fortunately,
the person working at the front desk was

1156
00:49:54,621 --> 00:49:59,621
mildly retarded.
And I say fortunately because he's 

1157
00:49:59,621 --> 00:49:59,621
completely unfazed.
But what just happened?

1158
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:02,150
It's three in the morning.
The phones are ringing off the hook from

1159
00:50:02,151 --> 00:50:07,151
people staying at the hotel who just saw
the guy jumped out the window screaming,

1160
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:10,490
I'm bleeding in my underwear and I say 
hello,

1161
00:50:10,491 --> 00:50:14,450
because you have to start somewhere.
I'm staying at the hotel.

1162
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:16,820
I had an incident where I jumped out my 
window.

1163
00:50:16,821 --> 00:50:19,300
I'm bleeding and I need to see a doctor.
And,

1164
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:21,140
and I,
and I was so relieved because,

1165
00:50:21,141 --> 00:50:24,770
uh,
the guy working at the front desk goes,

1166
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,170
right?
It was like completely unfazed.

1167
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,890
What had just happened,
so I drove myself to the hospital.

1168
00:50:29,891 --> 00:50:34,891
He told me where it was.
The agenda is that guy who worked the 

1169
00:50:34,891 --> 00:50:36,560
front desk facebook messaged me and 
said,

1170
00:50:36,561 --> 00:50:41,561
hey,
I'm the guy at the front desk and I'm 

1171
00:50:41,561 --> 00:50:41,561
not mildly retarded.

1172
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:46,160
What's great is that the,
the,

1173
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:51,540
the,
the message is so incoherent that he 

1174
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:51,830
sent me that.
It's like,

1175
00:50:51,831 --> 00:50:56,831
well,
are you sure if I forwarded this to 

1176
00:50:56,831 --> 00:50:56,831
someone?
They might take my side.

1177
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:02,120
Oh my god.
That is such a crazy fucking story.

1178
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,530
So from.
Did you.

1179
00:51:03,531 --> 00:51:05,990
Were you there for a weekend?
Like did you have to do stand up there?

1180
00:51:05,991 --> 00:51:08,930
The rest.
I was performing at whitman college that

1181
00:51:08,931 --> 00:51:13,931
night and then I was performing at 
university of Oregon the next day and I 

1182
00:51:13,931 --> 00:51:17,030
actually did the gig with all the 
brokenness and I didn't tell anybody.

1183
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:22,150
Wow.
So you just did the gig to understand 

1184
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:22,700
that the money you're broke and you were
just mangled cut up.

1185
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,510
I wasn't,
nothing messed with my face up so no one

1186
00:51:26,511 --> 00:51:28,340
could tell I was wearing long sleeves 
and everything.

1187
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:31,550
That's so lucky.
It's unbelievably fortunate.

1188
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:32,940
Yeah,
it was just,

1189
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:33,890
it was,
it was,

1190
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:38,891
honestly,
it was a moment in my life where I was 

1191
00:51:38,891 --> 00:51:38,891
broke.

1192
00:51:38,891 --> 00:51:41,590
I was hustling so hard.
It all factored into the jump through 

1193
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:42,650
the window.
I was dealing with a lot of anxiety.

1194
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,970
So the anxiety and the stress manifests 
itself in the sleepwalking.

1195
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:46,520
Yeah.
So,

1196
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:51,521
so I,
I'm diagnosed with rem behavior 

1197
00:51:51,521 --> 00:51:51,521
disorder,
which is a chemical imbalance.

1198
00:51:51,521 --> 00:51:55,691
It means people who have a dope,
some people who have a dopamine 

1199
00:51:55,691 --> 00:51:56,540
deficiency,
which is the chemical that's released in

1200
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:58,310
your brain and your body when you fall 
asleep,

1201
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,460
that paralyzes your body so you don't 
act out your dreams.

1202
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:05,930
That's essentially what happens when you
sleep is your body's paralyzed.

1203
00:52:05,931 --> 00:52:10,931
You can't do it.
I have a dopamine deficiency and as a 

1204
00:52:10,931 --> 00:52:13,520
result I act out my dreams.
And so since then I was diagnosed,

1205
00:52:13,521 --> 00:52:18,521
so I take,
I shouldn't tell people that I take by 

1206
00:52:18,521 --> 00:52:19,190
take an antianxiety yeah.
And then,

1207
00:52:19,191 --> 00:52:24,191
uh,
and it calms me down and then I don't 

1208
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:26,960
feel like I need in my dreams to run 
away from things like why do you say you

1209
00:52:26,961 --> 00:52:28,100
shouldn't tell people what you take?

1210
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,780
Well,
because I'm not a doctor,

1211
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:33,500
so I don't want to tell you,
I don't want people to self diagnose and

1212
00:52:33,501 --> 00:52:33,860
go,
oh,

1213
00:52:33,861 --> 00:52:36,020
I have that.
And it's like you don't really know.

1214
00:52:36,021 --> 00:52:38,450
I did a sleep study.
I slept overnight at the hotel,

1215
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:42,140
at the hospital for nights.
Like they really know what I have.

1216
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:43,990
Yeah.
Well that's very responsible of you.

1217
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:44,720
Yeah.
You know?

1218
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:50,200
Yeah.
So when you start taking this 

1219
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,110
medication,
even though you're taking this 

1220
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:53,110
medication,
you still don't trust yourself.

1221
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:54,080
You stills up?
Yeah,

1222
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:56,210
kinda like a condom over a birth control
pill.

1223
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,680
Wow.
Well,

1224
00:52:57,681 --> 00:52:59,430
I guess once you jump out of a fucking 
window,

1225
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:06,470
got to get some reinforcement bars over 
your windows.

1226
00:53:06,471 --> 00:53:07,910
Mandy worried about break ins?
Nope.

1227
00:53:07,911 --> 00:53:10,420
Breakouts,
breakouts.

1228
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,730
The crazy breakouts we're trying to keep
it in.

1229
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:14,680
Wow.
Yeah.

1230
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:18,080
And so by taking an anti anxiety 
medication,

1231
00:53:18,081 --> 00:53:21,410
has that changed you like your regular,
everyday life?

1232
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:23,160
I'd like to think no.
Uh,

1233
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,800
I fear sometimes.
I mean like,

1234
00:53:25,801 --> 00:53:26,160
you know,

1235
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:26,640
I,
I,

1236
00:53:26,641 --> 00:53:29,220
um,
I feel like what I take for a while,

1237
00:53:29,221 --> 00:53:32,040
it felt like it made me a bit fuzzy 
feeling when I wake up in the morning.

1238
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:34,530
I have to drink a lot of coffee to get 
to regular,

1239
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,690
which I don't love.
Right.

1240
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,180
And it's all because of that.
Yeah.

1241
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:41,550
Is there any natural cure?
Is there anything that you've been going

1242
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,360
to a holistic doctor recently who's been
given for as though.

1243
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,570
Oh,
you don't think that's good?

1244
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,960
I don't know.
I just always say that holistic doctor,

1245
00:53:48,961 --> 00:53:51,600
all those motherfuckers,
she took a,

1246
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:56,810
she took like a 10 vials of blood and 
did a whole thing on which vitamins I 

1247
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:58,360
should take to counterbalance things.
And uh,

1248
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:00,720
I feel like that's leveling me off a 
little bit.

1249
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,660
Would you watch your diet?
Are you fairly healthy?

1250
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:03,460
Try to,
yeah.

1251
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,790
Trying to have protein in the morning 
and stuff like that.

1252
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:10,460
But do you like gluten?
And I'm trying to wean myself off of it.

1253
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:14,100
You eat gluten.
I stopped about six months ago.

1254
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:15,630
How do you feel about it?
A lot better.

1255
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:18,360
Well,
I stopped when I was filming this show.

1256
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:23,390
I was having back problems from jujitsu 
and one of the things that this woman 

1257
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:25,200
who's a physical therapist told me,
she said real good results.

1258
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:30,180
People that have injuries getting off of
gluten reduces inflammation and in a lot

1259
00:54:30,181 --> 00:54:33,000
of the symptoms of the injuries subside.
And I was like,

1260
00:54:33,001 --> 00:54:33,600
wait,
wait a minute,

1261
00:54:33,601 --> 00:54:38,601
you can tell me like bread,
like stopping bread makes an injury 

1262
00:54:38,601 --> 00:54:38,601
better.
And she's like,

1263
00:54:38,601 --> 00:54:39,990
you really would be amazed.
And so,

1264
00:54:39,991 --> 00:54:41,940
uh,
I tried it and uh,

1265
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:44,790
I,
my injury got better,

1266
00:54:44,791 --> 00:54:49,791
like slowly petroleum its own through a 
lot of different therapies that I was 

1267
00:54:49,791 --> 00:54:50,550
doing.
But what was amazing was my energy level

1268
00:54:50,551 --> 00:54:51,030
is different.

1269
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,640
My energy level,
especially after meals.

1270
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:55,470
That was the most shocking thing.
Like I would,

1271
00:54:55,770 --> 00:55:00,770
I eat so much bread and pasta and then I
was realized that like after I had 

1272
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:06,230
eaten,
it was like I got hit with a 

1273
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:06,230
tranquilizer dart.
I just thought that's what it was.

1274
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:07,980
I thought I.
And this is what happens after you eat.

1275
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,830
Eating is like sex,
but no man,

1276
00:55:10,831 --> 00:55:14,250
not now.
Now I eat and after I'm done eating,

1277
00:55:14,251 --> 00:55:16,580
I'm full but I'm not in a coma.
Yeah,

1278
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:21,610
it's weird.
It's a totally different experience for 

1279
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,931
me because my basically my whole life,
I mean I'm italian mostly and most of my

1280
00:55:24,031 --> 00:55:29,031
life I grew up eating like that,
eating pasta and bread with every meal 

1281
00:55:29,031 --> 00:55:31,320
and when I stopped eating it it was 
like,

1282
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:33,090
oh,
oh,

1283
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:38,630
oh,
this is what had been dealing with my 

1284
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:38,630
whole life for no reason.

1285
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:39,780
Like every time I eat I would eat these 
big giant meals.

1286
00:55:39,781 --> 00:55:40,830
I'd be like,
oh,

1287
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:44,910
I just kicked back and I know that 
feeling that don't get that anymore.

1288
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:47,940
Now I eat and you know,
obviously my body's digesting,

1289
00:55:47,941 --> 00:55:52,650
I feel full and I don't feel like 
sedated los angeles is great for that.

1290
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:55,470
New york is good for that,
but like when you travel,

1291
00:55:55,471 --> 00:55:57,270
do you have a hard time finding the food
that you want?

1292
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,580
Steak and salad,
steak salad,

1293
00:55:59,581 --> 00:56:04,581
chicken salad.
I'm not ridiculous about it because I 

1294
00:56:04,581 --> 00:56:06,000
don't have celiac's disease.
It's not like a half to avoid it.

1295
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,020
So you know,
if something is breaded or you know,

1296
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:10,740
it doesn't kill me,
it just,

1297
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:12,990
it just.
I think it sets me back a little bit.

1298
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:18,830
I think your body's not designed to pro.
The wheat that we eat today is very 

1299
00:56:19,801 --> 00:56:24,801
different from the wheat that people had
100 years ago in the 19 fifties and 

1300
00:56:24,801 --> 00:56:26,890
sixties is when they started engineering
wheat to be more hardy,

1301
00:56:26,891 --> 00:56:31,891
so for better yields and so it could 
survive pesticides and whatnot and that 

1302
00:56:31,891 --> 00:56:34,240
we is much more difficult for people to 
process just is.

1303
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,120
It's a fact that's a science.
Yeah,

1304
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:37,990
I mean there,
there is science behind that.

1305
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,120
So when people talk about,
oh,

1306
00:56:40,121 --> 00:56:41,770
it's just another fad,
it's just another fad.

1307
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,680
It's actually not,
you know,

1308
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:45,550
there,
there were most certainly fads,

1309
00:56:45,551 --> 00:56:46,750
you know,
as far as,

1310
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:52,390
you know,
like the atkins diet and all these 

1311
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:52,390
various diets that can work,
you know,

1312
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:53,230
they,
they can have an effect,

1313
00:56:53,231 --> 00:56:55,450
you know,
you go into ketosis,

1314
00:56:55,451 --> 00:57:00,451
I guess it's called and you know,
your body starts burning fat instead of 

1315
00:57:00,451 --> 00:57:01,510
carbohydrates and I tried that.
I didn't like it at all.

1316
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:06,690
This is very different.
This to me seems like cutting out 

1317
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:07,360
something that my body really just 
doesn't enjoy process.

1318
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,590
Yeah,
that makes sense.

1319
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,180
No,
I mean I still look,

1320
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,040
I'm not a.
I'm not a perfect eater.

1321
00:57:12,041 --> 00:57:14,260
I still eat ice cream and I still drink 
milk.

1322
00:57:14,261 --> 00:57:15,190
And what do you do about pizza?

1323
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:16,330
Gluten free pizza.
I don't.

1324
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:17,580
I try it.
It's dark shit.

1325
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:22,640
It's dog shit.
I haven't had pizza in alongside format 

1326
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:22,640
to have pizza.
Yeah,

1327
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:27,061
I haven't had pizza and like it's been 
at least six or seven months since I've 

1328
00:57:27,061 --> 00:57:27,970
had except some gluten free pizza,
which was uh,

1329
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:29,490
I just,
uh,

1330
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:34,520
I made a tweet about it.
I said I'm having gluten free pizza and 

1331
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:34,520
to let you know,
you don't have to,

1332
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,730
don't ever just don't.
It's not pizza,

1333
00:57:36,731 --> 00:57:41,731
it's nonsense.
Someone said there's a good kind out 

1334
00:57:41,731 --> 00:57:44,431
there,
but I think that just builds fucking 

1335
00:57:44,431 --> 00:57:44,431
people that don't want to believe.
Yeah.

1336
00:57:44,431 --> 00:57:45,940
I don't know.
But uh,

1337
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:50,320
as far as like health,
I think the majority of people don't get

1338
00:57:50,321 --> 00:57:55,321
enough.
The big issue I think as far as 

1339
00:57:55,321 --> 00:57:57,230
nutrition is,
is green leafy vegetables and uh,

1340
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:57,780
and,
and,

1341
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:01,030
and lots of vegetables.
People just don't eat enough vegetables.

1342
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:04,390
And if you don't eat enough vegetables 
and you also don't take vitamins.

1343
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,040
Yeah,
good luck.

1344
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:11,250
You know,
your body's just basically operating on 

1345
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:14,110
proteins and carbohydrates and whatever 
the fuck it can find,

1346
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:19,140
but you're not getting enough vitamins.
You're just not like the idea of a 

1347
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:22,531
balanced diet.
Most people's diet or they're not even 

1348
00:58:22,531 --> 00:58:24,250
close to balanced.
It's like I've watched friends like,

1349
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:25,660
been like on,
on the road,

1350
00:58:25,661 --> 00:58:27,640
like comics.
I've been with them for every meal,

1351
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:32,790
you know,
and I've watched what they eat and like 

1352
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:34,521
you,
you're not getting anywhere like you 

1353
00:58:34,521 --> 00:58:34,521
got.
You got an egg in there.

1354
00:58:34,521 --> 00:58:34,690
Yeah.
There's some bread in that.

1355
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,940
I think there's a piece of lettuce.
They're like,

1356
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:38,740
where the fuck you getting your vitamins
from,

1357
00:58:38,741 --> 00:58:39,280
man?
Yeah,

1358
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:43,060
I think I'm in that boat.
Do you take supplements?

1359
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:45,400
You take vitamins.
I just started to like two months ago.

1360
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,840
Just started.
Really?

1361
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:49,960
Wow.
You're so disappointed.

1362
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:51,050
No,
sorry.

1363
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:56,070
It's interesting.
Did you notice a difference once you 

1364
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:56,960
started taking vitamins?
Yeah.

1365
00:58:56,961 --> 00:58:58,720
I feel better.
I feel better.

1366
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:00,370
I have.
Everybody's on starving.

1367
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,440
Yeah,
your vitamin starved.

1368
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:04,120
I invited him and starved.
Yeah,

1369
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:09,240
but most of us are.
If you eat the average quote unquote 

1370
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,090
average american diet,
your vitamin starved.

1371
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,670
Yeah.
It's,

1372
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:16,830
it's hard to travel and be healthy.
It is what I started doing nights or 

1373
00:59:17,081 --> 00:59:19,900
doing yoga and I travel.
I feel better.

1374
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,160
I feel a lot better than that.
That's because of all the girls

1375
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,260
that yoga pants in the class.
It makes you feel better too.

1376
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:25,700
Is that what it is?
Excited.

1377
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,800
Maybe I'm misunderstanding the whole 
thing.

1378
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:34,260
No yoga.
I could just go to the yoga pants or.

1379
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:39,340
Yeah,
you can just go to a strip club and you 

1380
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:39,340
feel great.
Well,

1381
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:39,340
I started going to strip clubs in the 
road and I just,

1382
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:39,530
uh,
I really,

1383
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:44,570
it really picked me be I wrote down a 
strip club name.

1384
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:49,130
I played largo the other night and 
there's a place across from it that,

1385
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:51,470
I don't know what it's called in the 
phone book,

1386
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:57,040
but the name on the outside of the door 
is star strip is all the same font and 

1387
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,180
font size.
Star strip.

1388
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,780
Totally nude live nude girls,
girls,

1389
01:00:05,781 --> 01:00:08,000
girls.
The star strip on la cienega.

1390
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:09,020
Yeah.
Yeah.

1391
01:00:09,021 --> 01:00:11,390
Dude,
I had a bit about that it true story,

1392
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:15,320
um,
where the girl was dancing and I said,

1393
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:16,310
hey,
do you,

1394
01:00:16,311 --> 01:00:18,020
do you like doing this?
She goes,

1395
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:20,630
I don't talk to guys who come here.
And I said,

1396
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:21,320
well,
why?

1397
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:22,790
I mean it's an open door.
I mean,

1398
01:00:22,791 --> 01:00:24,470
like,
nice people can come through too.

1399
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:25,940
And she goes,
well,

1400
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,490
most guys who come here,
the only come here for one reason.

1401
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:29,690
I mean,
why did you come here?

1402
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:32,480
Like she was shutting me down and I 
said,

1403
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:37,530
because someone told me there was a 
place that I could do go where I could 

1404
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:37,880
see a strange girl's pussy for a dollar.

1405
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:42,680
And that was the joke.
Like,

1406
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:46,880
I'm the asshole.
I only did it show up where you work,

1407
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:51,950
right?
I'm not a bad person because you work 

1408
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:51,950
here,
you know,

1409
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:54,260
different people go to different places,
different reasons to go to strip clubs a

1410
01:00:54,261 --> 01:00:54,820
lot.
And you know,

1411
01:00:54,821 --> 01:00:57,230
it turned me off.
I was in nashville once,

1412
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:00,140
I saw a commercial on tv for a strip 
club and I was like,

1413
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,730
I would like,
that seems fun.

1414
01:01:01,731 --> 01:01:03,630
I'll go there.
And uh,

1415
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,840
and they went and then I gave the guy my
id when I walked in and he goes,

1416
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:13,760
hey mike birbiglia,
I like your comedy.

1417
01:01:13,761 --> 01:01:15,920
And I was just like,
I'm never going to a strip club again.

1418
01:01:15,921 --> 01:01:17,150
I've never gone back.
Why?

1419
01:01:17,151 --> 01:01:20,290
Because I liked the anonymity of it.
I don't want to be,

1420
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:24,940
I don't want anyone to watch me watch 
someone beating it.

1421
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:25,750
I just,
I'm not,

1422
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:26,750
I can't handle that.

1423
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:31,900
You need a wig and a fake mustache and 
if you have a wig or a fake mustache 

1424
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:33,500
one,
we're in hollywood.

1425
01:01:33,501 --> 01:01:35,450
There's plenty of stores.
Yeah,

1426
01:01:35,451 --> 01:01:36,830
I,
that's why I'm here.

1427
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:43,270
Sorry.
It took so long for me to get to the 

1428
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:43,270
point.
But uh,

1429
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:46,720
yeah.
Do you have like a costume I can wear 

1430
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,040
because I'm really want to go guy.
And he goes,

1431
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:48,750
no,
no,

1432
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:54,280
no.
It's funny you should say that about 

1433
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:54,280
you're asking like why,
why,

1434
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:58,480
why the woman was there and everything.
Because that's when I used to go to 

1435
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,721
strip clubs.
That was what I was most interested in 

1436
01:02:01,721 --> 01:02:01,721
the story.
I want to know the story.

1437
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:05,050
How did you get here?
And maybe,

1438
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:07,420
maybe it's kind of mean spirited and 
suddenly,

1439
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:09,650
but I actually,
it is interesting to me.

1440
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:11,630
I don't think it's mean spirited.
No,

1441
01:02:11,631 --> 01:02:15,410
I mean you can have a look.
I have been to many a strip club with my

1442
01:02:15,411 --> 01:02:19,220
dad and I've had some fun conversations 
with girls who are dancers.

1443
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:20,280
It wasn't

1444
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,790
demeaning,
it wasn't meant it respectfully.

1445
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:25,620
When I would do it.
Very nice people,

1446
01:02:25,621 --> 01:02:27,660
they just happen to be dancers.
There's nothing wrong with it,

1447
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:32,661
man.
I think there's a weird sort of a 

1448
01:02:32,661 --> 01:02:34,971
connection between standup comics and 
strippers anyway because they were.

1449
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:39,060
Our worlds are so odd in comparison to 
the average person,

1450
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,160
oddly similar,
I think in a lot of ways.

1451
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:42,960
Well,
because standup comedy,

1452
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:45,450
you're as naked as you can be.
Yes.

1453
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:48,540
Verbally and you're talking about,
you're talking about your life,

1454
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:53,640
the best comedians essentially as you're
watching them make it a certain way.

1455
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,540
Absolutely.
And you know,

1456
01:02:55,541 --> 01:02:57,210
and that's obviously the strippers who 
literally.

1457
01:02:57,420 --> 01:03:02,420
Yeah.
And you're also living this weird 

1458
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:03,450
alternative life that most people can't 
relate to it.

1459
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:05,440
Most people with nine to five jobs can't
relate to.

1460
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:07,410
Very strange.
Yeah.

1461
01:03:07,411 --> 01:03:09,780
Like if you did a stripper and she comes
over your house at 3:00

1462
01:03:09,781 --> 01:03:14,781
in the morning after she gets off work 
and she's got a little glitter bag full 

1463
01:03:14,781 --> 01:03:16,380
of money and it's like we're both weird,
you know,

1464
01:03:16,381 --> 01:03:21,381
I just got done telling jokes and 
drinking on stage and here you got off 

1465
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:21,381
stage.

1466
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:26,120
That's what they're weird lives.
Being an actor is a weird life if you 

1467
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:26,220
didn't act or strange.
Yes,

1468
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:30,020
but in a more,
a less naked way.

1469
01:03:30,021 --> 01:03:31,260
And your wife,
girlfriends,

1470
01:03:31,261 --> 01:03:33,040
like making out with some guy in the 
day.

1471
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:36,010
True work over and over again.
That's ridiculous.

1472
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,740
After take.
Fuck that.

1473
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:40,080
Yeah,
I've seen that before.

1474
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:46,580
I've seen people like watch their wives 
or girlfriends a make out with other 

1475
01:03:46,771 --> 01:03:51,771
guys like tongue and everything and 
watch him and watch her and watch him 

1476
01:03:51,771 --> 01:03:53,070
and watch her and go,
I don't want to do that.

1477
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:58,310
Yeah,
but the acting thing is like the 

1478
01:03:58,310 --> 01:04:00,351
opposite of being naked.
It's like putting on a fucking outfit 

1479
01:04:00,351 --> 01:04:00,351
or.
You think so?

1480
01:04:00,351 --> 01:04:01,140
Yeah.
I don't think it's naked at all.

1481
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:06,170
I think the acting is,
is putting on armor that's putting on 

1482
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:10,880
this armor of this bullshit character 
that some writer created and you're 

1483
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,660
pretending to be this person,
whereas.

1484
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:17,690
No,
but I think the best ones are opening 

1485
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:17,690
up,
opening up.

1486
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:18,030
They're opening up their souls.
I think the best ones,

1487
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:21,930
the best actors.
I mean they become that guy,

1488
01:04:21,931 --> 01:04:23,400
but I mean like,
okay,

1489
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:26,520
here's a perfect example.
A christian bale in the machinist.

1490
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,540
He wasn't really an anorexic,
that was the.

1491
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,180
Couldn't sleep and he forced himself to 
do that.

1492
01:04:33,181 --> 01:04:36,540
He just became that guy for that role.
It was a,

1493
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,050
it was,
uh,

1494
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:40,650
it was an affectation.
He put it on.

1495
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:42,750
It was a costume.
It was a,

1496
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:44,910
you know,
a role he played.

1497
01:04:44,911 --> 01:04:47,880
It wasn't him who.
He decided to be me.

1498
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:52,940
We can find areas in ourselves.
That's one of the weirdest fucking that 

1499
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:57,660
is so weird that he was bullying.
It's him next to batman when he was 

1500
01:04:58,771 --> 01:05:02,010
fucking swole,
which is only like six months later.

1501
01:05:02,011 --> 01:05:04,770
I think the one,
the photo on the left is real.

1502
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:05,810
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1503
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:06,420
yeah,
yeah.

1504
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:11,750
He starved himself.
He ate like a can of tuna and an apple 

1505
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:15,190
like every day.
That's all he ate and he got down to an 

1506
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:18,501
insanely small size.
I think he was to like 130 pounds or 

1507
01:05:18,611 --> 01:05:23,611
something ridiculous like that.
He's a big guy and then he went up to 

1508
01:05:23,611 --> 01:05:25,510
200 plus when he played batman.
Yeah.

1509
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:27,640
Yeah.
Pretty nuts,

1510
01:05:27,641 --> 01:05:29,950
man.
That guy's nuts that,

1511
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,870
that,
that thing that they do.

1512
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:36,690
Like I just got back from last week and 
I saw dallas buyers club here.

1513
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:39,950
Matthew mcconaughey.
Fucking fantastic.

1514
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:40,540
Heard.
It's great.

1515
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:45,630
I have a friend who always shits on 
matthew mcconaughey and thinks that 

1516
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:45,940
matthew mcconaughey's correcting is 
terrible.

1517
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:49,660
Matthew mcconaughey is like,
his ego is transparent and is acting.

1518
01:05:49,661 --> 01:05:52,370
It's mostly because my friends in actor,
but uh,

1519
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:53,590
I said,
dude,

1520
01:05:53,591 --> 01:05:58,591
you got to watch dallas buyers club and 
then shut the fuck up because the guy 

1521
01:05:58,591 --> 01:05:59,350
knocks it out of the park is fantastic 
in it.

1522
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:02,620
I saw two movies this weekend.
I saw,

1523
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:07,330
I saw the catching fire.
I liked it with catching fire.

1524
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:10,030
The hunger games movie.
How dare you say that?

1525
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,680
Why nothing.
I know.

1526
01:06:11,681 --> 01:06:13,630
Everybody makes fun of me.
I like gravity.

1527
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:15,040
I don't know.
It was good.

1528
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,690
I enjoyed it.
I,

1529
01:06:16,691 --> 01:06:18,850
you know what I thought was fascinating 
about gravity,

1530
01:06:18,851 --> 01:06:23,740
which watching neil degrasse tyson a 
tweet about everything that's wrong,

1531
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:29,380
the movie and then watching people 
attack him because I saw a lot of that 

1532
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:35,490
because neil degrasse tyson is like,
he's one of those guys that I don't 

1533
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:37,200
think ever takes heat,
you know,

1534
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:40,450
because he's such a nice guy.
He's so brilliant.

1535
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:45,600
He's so well informed about the ways of 
the universe and so excellent at 

1536
01:06:46,721 --> 01:06:51,721
expressing himself.
He's one of the best representatives of 

1537
01:06:51,721 --> 01:06:54,910
science I think we have today,
and he always gets love everywhere.

1538
01:06:54,911 --> 01:06:58,330
He goes like everybody's all these 
internet memes of pictures of him.

1539
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:04,230
Then this came out and he starts 
correcting the movie and the fucking 

1540
01:07:05,111 --> 01:07:10,111
hate.
You can't correct a Sandra Bullock 

1541
01:07:10,111 --> 01:07:10,111
movie.
He just can't.

1542
01:07:10,111 --> 01:07:10,540
Yeah,
you can't hate on Sandra Bullock.

1543
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:13,350
They fucking went after him.
Well,

1544
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:18,840
neil degrasse tyson says his criticisms 
of gravity or a compliment to its 

1545
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:19,150
quality.
Huh?

1546
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:20,890
That's,
that's because he took.

1547
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:25,920
I took the hit the right to.
To earn the right to be criticized as a 

1548
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:29,620
high compliment indeed.
What?

1549
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:34,980
Hmm.
That sounds like a guy fucking feeling 

1550
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:36,150
the heat talking nonsense,
feeling the heat.

1551
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:38,800
Some people criticize the story of the 
movie and I was like,

1552
01:07:38,801 --> 01:07:43,150
you know,
I felt like 10 minutes in I was like,

1553
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:48,480
I got my $15 worth.
I never thought that I'd know what it 

1554
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:48,480
felt like to go to space.
Yeah.

1555
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:51,100
I love the fact that everything was 
silent.

1556
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:56,550
Me too.
He's like in the middle of the 

1557
01:07:56,550 --> 01:07:56,550
explosions and all this shit.

1558
01:07:56,550 --> 01:07:59,940
It's silent and yet you're still 
freaking the fuck out is actually more 

1559
01:07:59,940 --> 01:07:59,940
effective.
I thought.

1560
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:01,840
Did you see the director's movie?
Children of men.

1561
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:03,580
Children of men?
Yes.

1562
01:08:03,581 --> 01:08:04,870
I saw.
Yeah.

1563
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,120
That was the one where people are like,
the males are like,

1564
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,990
the people can't breed or something.
Yeah,

1565
01:08:10,991 --> 01:08:11,900
that's right.
Yeah.

1566
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,390
The,
um,

1567
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:16,430
the thing that I found was most 
fascinating about gravity,

1568
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,070
um,
was the,

1569
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:23,110
just the idea that people do really go 
up there and really do stay up there for

1570
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:29,240
long periods of time and space and they 
really are in grave danger and they 

1571
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,430
this,
this possibility of things colliding and

1572
01:08:31,431 --> 01:08:34,130
space junk to very real,
real problem.

1573
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:39,160
Yeah.
This fucking thousands of things 

1574
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:39,160
floating around above the earth.
Thousands.

1575
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,470
It's so insane.
I'd love,

1576
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:45,480
I'd love john august,
the screenwriter made this point that I 

1577
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:48,461
think is of brilliant about it,
which is what's exciting about the 

1578
01:08:48,461 --> 01:08:48,461
movies.

1579
01:08:48,461 --> 01:08:53,020
It's $100 million dollar movie major 
budget movie where the lead character 

1580
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:57,350
doesn't save the world.
She just saves herself.

1581
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,810
And that's powerful.
Yeah.

1582
01:08:59,811 --> 01:09:04,811
What people didn't like to.
A lot of people didn't like the george 

1583
01:09:04,811 --> 01:09:07,270
clooney guy because it was just so.
And the other thing was when he lets go 

1584
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:09,200
when he has to let go because it's 
pulling him away.

1585
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:12,000
There's no momentum in space.
People said the science if it's wrong.

1586
01:09:12,001 --> 01:09:13,460
Yeah,
science is so wrong.

1587
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:15,840
I was fine with that though because I 
don't know much about science.

1588
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:18,560
The science is not just wrong about 
that,

1589
01:09:18,561 --> 01:09:21,470
it's also wrong about the positions of 
the various space stations,

1590
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:23,960
like they're not anywhere near each 
other.

1591
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:28,990
Like what she did by skipping from one 
to the next would be absolutely 

1592
01:09:29,631 --> 01:09:34,631
completely impossible there.
They're not in the same hemisphere that 

1593
01:09:34,631 --> 01:09:35,090
nowhere near to each other.
I just gave it the benefit,

1594
01:09:35,091 --> 01:09:40,091
the benefit of the doubt because she had
that weird divorce because of Jesse 

1595
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:41,180
James.

1596
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:42,770
He gave this movie the benefit of the 
doubt.

1597
01:09:43,070 --> 01:09:48,070
That's how it works.
We'll let it go with the science stuff 

1598
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:48,070
just because she's had a hard time last 
couple of years.

1599
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:49,220
Yeah,
that's sweet of you.

1600
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:50,690
Yeah.
Well I'm,

1601
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,420
I'm,
you know,

1602
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:56,520
I'm a big fan of anything space.
I think space is probably the most 

1603
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:56,520
overlooked thing.
Fascinating.

1604
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,730
The history of humanity.
It's incredible.

1605
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:03,850
Which still have enough light.
I feel that way about the see the 

1606
01:10:03,850 --> 01:10:03,850
season.
Other one.

1607
01:10:03,850 --> 01:10:08,080
Yeah.
The sea and space are the two most 

1608
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:08,080
interesting places I think.
Yeah,

1609
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,640
the sea less so for me,
but still pretty fucking fascinating.

1610
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:15,850
You know,
it's basically like a jungle or 

1611
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:15,850
underwater.
I loved what you were tweeting the other

1612
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:17,780
day about black fish because I think 
that that's a great cause.

1613
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:23,380
Oh yeah.
We had the filled dimmers who was a 

1614
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:24,740
trainer over at seaworld or whatever the
heck it was,

1615
01:10:24,741 --> 01:10:26,780
marine land in Canada.

1616
01:10:27,230 --> 01:10:29,690
That was depressing.
I know it's miserable,

1617
01:10:29,691 --> 01:10:32,240
but it's good that you're tweeting about
it because it's a good cause.

1618
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:33,530
Yeah,
I agree.

1619
01:10:33,531 --> 01:10:34,600
It is.
Um,

1620
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:39,910
I see life very fascinating to me.
Intelligency life even more so.

1621
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:45,580
I just think people are very.
This is not funny or an item here or 

1622
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:52,480
there,
but I just think people are generally 

1623
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:55,510
unwilling to accept sea life and animals
as having an intelligence that we just 

1624
01:10:56,181 --> 01:10:57,500
don't understand.
Well,

1625
01:10:57,501 --> 01:10:59,600
they certainly to mean there,
there's no doubt about it.

1626
01:10:59,601 --> 01:11:04,601
When,
when you talk to people who understand 

1627
01:11:04,601 --> 01:11:04,840
orcas are or dolphins,
they're very intelligent.

1628
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:09,850
Yeah.
Just intelligent in a different way 

1629
01:11:09,850 --> 01:11:09,850
because they don't alter their 
environment.

1630
01:11:09,850 --> 01:11:14,050
And as we were talking about space,
about how fascinating spaces that the 

1631
01:11:14,050 --> 01:11:18,381
real issue is,
if we treat intelligent lifeforms on 

1632
01:11:18,381 --> 01:11:19,200
this planet that we can understand the 
way that we do,

1633
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:21,570
especially helpless ones essentially 
help us once,

1634
01:11:21,571 --> 01:11:26,100
like orcas and dolphins,
they really can't do anything to prevent

1635
01:11:26,101 --> 01:11:28,230
us from doing what we want them to do.

1636
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:30,660
It really can't prevent us from 
kidnapping them.

1637
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:33,270
They can just try to run away,
but they can't fight back.

1638
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,850
They really can't do anything.
What w what?

1639
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,280
What are.
What is an alien race going to do to us?

1640
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:39,860
If they ever get ahold of us,
oh,

1641
01:11:39,861 --> 01:11:44,861
I'm so worried.
And they see how we treat intelligent 

1642
01:11:44,861 --> 01:11:44,861
life forms.
Why would they respect us?

1643
01:11:44,861 --> 01:11:46,590
Why would they want to do anything?
Why would they?

1644
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:49,830
Why would they be kind?
Why would they give us information?

1645
01:11:49,831 --> 01:11:52,650
Why would they try to help us evolve?
They'd go,

1646
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:53,520
well,
it's going to go.

1647
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:57,330
Aliens is going to go.
And it's not an if it's a.

1648
01:11:57,331 --> 01:12:00,960
When when the aliens come or we arrive 
at the aliens,

1649
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:04,590
it's going to go one of two ways.
We enslave them,

1650
01:12:04,591 --> 01:12:06,000
they enslave us.
That's it,

1651
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:09,250
that's the only version of what can 
happen or we eat them or they know.

1652
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:10,660
Oh,
we fucked up.

1653
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:13,430
Right.
Yeah.

1654
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:14,820
Do you,
do you,

1655
01:12:14,821 --> 01:12:19,821
um,
ever get a chance when you do an all 

1656
01:12:19,821 --> 01:12:21,921
your travel?
Do you ever get a chance to go to any 

1657
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:23,100
observatories?
The cat in Hawaii or you know,

1658
01:12:23,101 --> 01:12:25,960
any of the telescopes I tried to,
yeah,

1659
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:27,390
I haven't done it recently,
but yeah,

1660
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:32,391
I tried to,
one of the most life changing things 

1661
01:12:32,391 --> 01:12:33,080
I've ever done besides psychedelic drugs
and having kids is a,

1662
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,580
going to the keck observatory.
Where is that?

1663
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:37,630
It's on the big island of Hawaii.
Oh,

1664
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:41,700
the fucking view of the stars is so mind
blowing.

1665
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:44,550
You can't believe it's real because 
you're,

1666
01:12:44,551 --> 01:12:46,830
you're on the island.
It's 9,000

1667
01:12:46,831 --> 01:12:48,690
feet above sea level as the visitors 
place.

1668
01:12:48,691 --> 01:12:51,970
And then there's the main observatory,
which is higher than that.

1669
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:53,810
You're literally,
I'm looking at the picture.

1670
01:12:53,811 --> 01:12:56,160
It's not evil.
You're above the clouds.

1671
01:12:56,190 --> 01:12:59,670
That's literally above the clouds as we 
were driving,

1672
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:00,810
you know,
um,

1673
01:13:01,370 --> 01:13:02,850
I was with my family and we were like,
oh,

1674
01:13:02,851 --> 01:13:03,440
this sucks.

1675
01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:04,980
It's cloudy.
We're going to miss it.

1676
01:13:04,981 --> 01:13:09,981
This is not going to work because we're 
gonna we're going to get up there and 

1677
01:13:09,981 --> 01:13:09,981
we're not gonna be able to see through 
the clouds,

1678
01:13:09,981 --> 01:13:12,990
but then you pass through the clouds and
then you look up.

1679
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:15,100
Oh,
that's nothing with what you're saying.

1680
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:16,380
Yeah.
That's nothing.

1681
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:20,130
The only thing I can compare to this is 
Alaska have ever been to Alaska.

1682
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:21,220
Yes.
Like faire.

1683
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:26,320
Fairbank's is unbelievable.
I highly recommend people listening to 

1684
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:30,651
this.
I've never been to Hawaii and I want to 

1685
01:13:30,651 --> 01:13:30,651
go there.
People have never been to.

1686
01:13:30,651 --> 01:13:31,120
Alaska should go to Alaska if you have 
the man.

1687
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:32,040
Oh,
no doubt,

1688
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:33,380
because it is.
They sit,

1689
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:38,420
you know,
they call it the last frontier and 

1690
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:38,420
everything,
but it really is.

1691
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:41,690
It's undiscovered areas.
It's uncultivated areas and it's 

1692
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:42,140
stunning.
Yeah,

1693
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:45,680
it's amazing.
I went salmon fishing with ari fear.

1694
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:51,020
We went up there this year in july and 
we caught salmon and did a gig up there 

1695
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:53,070
and I fell in love with the place.
It's incredible.

1696
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:55,650
Anchorage is incredible.
Really fucking cool.

1697
01:13:55,651 --> 01:13:57,040
People too.
Like there's a.

1698
01:13:57,330 --> 01:14:01,130
There's a quality to the people that 
live up there because they're.

1699
01:14:01,131 --> 01:14:03,240
They're living in a legitimate 
wilderness,

1700
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:07,710
they have a city and that city is 
surrounded by absolute legit wilderness.

1701
01:14:07,711 --> 01:14:11,080
Like someone on the university of 
anchorage campus last year got killed by

1702
01:14:11,081 --> 01:14:12,040
a fucking moose.

1703
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:12,940
Yeah,
it happens.

1704
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:16,750
A moose came on the campus and stomped 
someone to death and that's like part of

1705
01:14:16,751 --> 01:14:17,590
their life.
Well,

1706
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:19,990
that's the thing that the students are 
very competitive.

1707
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:25,330
I don't think that's what it was about.
Mike birbiglia.

1708
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:27,550
Well,
you think it was the same article that I

1709
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:28,870
will know I talked to.
The guy was there.

1710
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:32,500
My friend is actually a professor at the
university.

1711
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:34,240
I got a hit.
I'm going to conan right now.

1712
01:14:34,241 --> 01:14:35,110
I got to drive.
There.

1713
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:38,290
Might have no wallet,
has no wallet,

1714
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,120
so if you get in an accident,
I'm screwed.

1715
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:43,360
And it's the same sort of situation is 
the last time you'll be doubly screwed.

1716
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:48,730
I'm.
I'm worried about my whole day to be 

1717
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:48,730
honest with you.
You want conan tonight?

1718
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:48,730
Yes.
Tonight.

1719
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:53,490
What time is it?
Eleven on tbs and there's a new show 

1720
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:54,430
after konan now.
Doesn't somebody else have a show now?

1721
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:55,520
Pete holmes.
Very funny.

1722
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:57,370
Pete holmes,
has it started yet?

1723
01:14:57,730 --> 01:14:58,870
Yeah,
he's really funny.

1724
01:14:58,990 --> 01:14:59,410
Yeah,
no,

1725
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:01,110
I haven't really seen it.
Yeah,

1726
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:04,270
it's not st pete.
Holmes isn't funny.

1727
01:15:04,670 --> 01:15:06,560
It's very funny.
How dare you,

1728
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:07,720
you know,
it's,

1729
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:10,420
it's on tbs.
I think it's in reruns right now,

1730
01:15:10,421 --> 01:15:15,421
but it was on for a few weeks and then I
think they're waiting here whether it 

1731
01:15:15,421 --> 01:15:15,421
gets picked up,
but it's.

1732
01:15:15,421 --> 01:15:15,421
Yeah,
it's great.

1733
01:15:15,421 --> 01:15:19,440
So your new cd is called my girlfriend's

miscommunication.
