1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,660
Four three,
two,

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,340
one,
boom.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,200
So I took a four and a half hour ride
down to San Diego because my friend

4
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:11,900
Brendan was felony to showtime.
Special.

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,310
Yeah.
And it was run the jewels the entire way

6
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:16,800
down and back.
It was awesome.

7
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:17,680
Thank you.
Whew.

8
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,910
I wish I could work out as hard as
people work out.

9
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:23,810
Tried music.
Well,

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,730
I've lost 31 pounds,
but I'd be 90 pounds out easy now.

11
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,100
That was one of the things that I was
saying.

12
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,940
This is workout music.
Yeah,

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,580
it is.
It is an elder and I are Chubby is too

14
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:34,290
fat,
but,

15
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,700
well,
you were saying you lost 31 pounds.

16
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,100
31 may be picked up three over the
holidays.

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:40,980
But I'm,
I'm,

18
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,210
I'm on my path.
I really am.

19
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:44,270
Shouts out to Al Clayborne,
um,

20
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,050
who's from out here?
Who's a hell of a trainer?

21
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:48,300
If I had his discipline,
I'd already be a hundred pounds down,

22
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:51,410
but the gold is a hundred and the next
18 months you can do it.

23
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,230
Yeah.
I'm not 100% just eat bad and got lazy.

24
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,490
Yeah.
But you know what,

25
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:57,470
man,
you could turn her.

26
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,600
It's one of those things where you just,
if you could stick with it for 90 days,

27
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:02,400
it will become a part of your life.
Well that's the goal.

28
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,630
That's the goal.
You know what I mean?

29
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:04,380
And,
and,

30
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,130
and,
and I'm,

31
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm about it.
Like,

32
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:09,600
cause I like meat so I still get to eat
me and I like green stuff and I don't

33
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:12,060
like salad dressing.
So I think it's going to be relatively

34
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:13,260
easy for me.
Yeah.

35
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:16,440
Like olive oil and vinegar does not
taste bad bro.

36
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:18,390
I don't even use that.
Like when I have a salad,

37
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:20,670
one wife make salad,
she literally will make the salad.

38
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:22,970
She may add a little goat cheese or not.
She'll,

39
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,170
she'll throw some chicken or some steak
on there.

40
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,170
But if it's fruit in the salad,
I don't need any salad dressing.

41
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:31,350
Just throw some strawberries and apples
or stuff to salting to just give me that

42
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:32,850
strive juicing.
And I'm good.

43
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,840
If I could figure out during that three
to four times a day versus the one meal

44
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:38,880
and with my wife and then he didn't like
trash in the studio.

45
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,850
I'll be,
that's the problems from the temptation

46
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,500
rules.
And you see burgers and fries.

47
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:44,370
Yeah.
Fuck it.

48
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,570
You see a Coca Cola?
Yeah.

49
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,750
That,
that really is it for me.

50
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,050
I had to quit sodas because the worst,
which is,

51
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:54,120
which is,
which brings me to cripple cola.

52
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,700
Yeah.
So what is critical to bottles of it?

53
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:57,850
But I wanted to keep it in the
frigerator.

54
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,610
I wanted to join it and it's perfect
temperature,

55
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,010
Coca Cola,
Pepsi Cola,

56
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:03,960
rse color,
anything with Cola.

57
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,900
Right.
Has probably killed more Americans than

58
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:08,010
anything else in the world.

59
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,620
Right?
So anything that's color,

60
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,350
cause Coca Cola was provided tons of
jobs in my hometown.

61
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,370
I won't want to diss them.
They might promote a concert,

62
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:17,340
am I right?
But we know that sugary drinks aren't

63
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:18,210
good for you.
Right?

64
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,550
Yet we don't have an aversion to,
we don't criminalize sugar.

65
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,270
And my doctor Larry told me,
Michael,

66
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:25,230
sugar is poison,
right?

67
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:29,530
I want you to work it out of your diet.
But these kids that are members of these

68
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,390
little punk ass street fraternity's
essentially gangs we criminalize and

69
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:36,630
villainize a bunch of teenagers who
simply don't have anything to do.

70
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:38,070
They don't have jobs,
they don't have skills,

71
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,100
they don't have organization,
they don't have police athletic league

72
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:43,490
like they used to.
They don't have people engaging them in

73
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:45,810
academics or sports where they used to.
So they just kind of,

74
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,830
you know,
mess off,

75
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:49,350
fuck off.
Sometimes fuck up in violence happens,

76
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:49,920
right?

77
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,310
If you could take those same kids with
the entrepreneurial spirit that will

78
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:56,820
sell your water on the side of a highway
and you add it to something to public

79
00:02:56,821 --> 00:02:58,230
already wants anyway,
Cola,

80
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,110
you create something like Cripple Colin
[inaudible] and essentially what you're

81
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:06,310
doing is creating the same sugary shit
that we all go buy and drink and we

82
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,770
should.
And now we're given the structure of say

83
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,540
a hell's angels to say,
yeah,

84
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,550
you could say were criminal
organization,

85
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,300
but we still can sell your fucking tee
shirt because we are now paying our

86
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:18,010
taxes.
We're now employing people and we're

87
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:19,270
were now doing what we're supposed to
do.

88
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,560
And that's what I wanted to give the
gift of my friends who are hurt,

89
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,080
who are members of street fraternities.
And we actually pulled it off at the

90
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,570
show.
These guys actually managed to bring

91
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:31,600
something in microcosm to the market in
Atlanta.

92
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,060
It did well enough for us to keep
continue doing it.

93
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,280
And I want to see how far I can go.
And what's in it?

94
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,080
Sugar,
water,

95
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,900
artificial for artificial arm.
Uh,

96
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:41,681
what is it?
Food,

97
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:42,730
color and flavor.
And that's it.

98
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:44,560
And I think it's six ingredients.
Total wheels,

99
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:45,460
does it,
have you ever,

100
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,770
do you know what Zevia is even fuck with
cvs?

101
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,840
I mean the fake sugar and stuff you use,
it's no,

102
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:52,540
Zvm has a soft drinks that are made with
Stevia.

103
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,790
Yeah.
But the thing is like,

104
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,860
you know,
what I found out when me was sugar is

105
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:00,190
either just do it or don't.
Like for me it's easy to do things that

106
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:01,870
are actually a real,
just sugar,

107
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:04,810
like a Mexican coke or just have,
you know,

108
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,950
some carbonated water and lemons in it.
I don't do well with irritation.

109
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,280
This cadillac in the hand job.

110
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,320
I want the whole thing.
I know what you're saying,

111
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,160
but this stuff is good.
It's,

112
00:04:13,161 --> 00:04:16,250
it's different.
[inaudible] who has adjusted Bieber?

113
00:04:16,251 --> 00:04:19,460
He's did it.
It's just I am such an addict as shut

114
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,410
the real thing.
Yeah.

115
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:22,900
So it doesn't make sense for me
sometimes to tempt myself.

116
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,910
I'll do is trump water.
I just,

117
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:28,690
I do a lot of water now,
a lot more water now and I do a lot of

118
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,200
club soda with lime,
which I used to talk shit to lp about.

119
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,800
I'm a chicken white guy,
drinks and now it's l is ordering a

120
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,591
fucking,
you know,

121
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:40,420
he's ordering a drink,
drink and I'm just like,

122
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:41,770
yeah,
I'll take a club soda in La.

123
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,530
That's good man.
If you could stick on that path.

124
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,090
Shouts out to my man Bariloche.
Um,

125
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,350
who is a friend and mentor.
A lot of times you might see a guy with

126
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:50,960
me.

127
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,110
Um,
does security bear introduce me to

128
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:55,870
Shaolin Kung Fu?
You mean basically kicking and punching

129
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:58,720
and moving around.
And he also introduced me to a lot of

130
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:00,640
the guests that are on your show.
Um,

131
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,900
including,
you know,

132
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,760
guests that talk about intermittent
fasting,

133
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,740
the talks about getting rid of the
sugars and stuff,

134
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:09,400
and he just loves me like a big brother.
So he keeps me in tune with what's going

135
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:10,990
on.
[inaudible] actually introduced me to

136
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,730
Stevia.
Always good to know God like that.

137
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,400
It's got its finger on the pulse.
I liked getting to know people.

138
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:17,980
They're smarter than me,
so I don't have to learn as much.

139
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,630
I can just go to them with questions.
Yeah.

140
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,010
That's the move.
Yeah.

141
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:22,720
I don't,
I don't like being the smartest guy.

142
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,880
No,
Nah.

143
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,270
Well,
I don't have that choice.

144
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,770
That's,
that option's not possible.

145
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,340
You need to get another rule of your
smart as fuck that.

146
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,960
Yeah.
I mean,

147
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,990
talking to Ilan Musk on the show about
that when he was,

148
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:37,280
I'm talking to me about the thoughts
that are bouncing,

149
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,430
bouncing around inside of his head that
he can't control,

150
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,110
and then he's like,
it's always been his whole life.

151
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:42,430
Like you wouldn't want to be me.
I was like,

152
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:44,200
Jesus Christ.
I'm just thinking about it.

153
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,080
I thought I did something to cool
smoking with mar and that was definitely

154
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:49,450
cool.
But you get an elan musk to fucking

155
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:52,780
smoke is classic stoner history in the
making right there.

156
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,090
Yeah.
I didn't even see,

157
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,980
the thing about it is if I had any idea
that

158
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,000
people would react to it that way.
I mean I would just do that on a normal

159
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:02,870
show.
That's normal.

160
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,531
Yeah,
California.

161
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:05,540
It's legal or smoke weed.
It's no big deal.

162
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,600
It's fun.
It's a slick,

163
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,240
a comradery thing.
Everybody thinks,

164
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,950
oh,
everybody's sharing space together.

165
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:14,530
It's a piece by week.
Absolutely.

166
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:18,170
It's one of the only things that you sip
off that another man's lips touched.

167
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,710
Like everybody does it right.
I will.

168
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,090
Women too,
but we just don't admit to ourselves

169
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,680
that there's another guy.
That's true.

170
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,990
But that's like it's been washed.
Yeah.

171
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,080
Joint to joint.
The person,

172
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:33,980
they'll be like,
oh no,

173
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:36,380
wash.
Like if someone wanted to give you a

174
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:37,820
haul off of their cigar,
try this.

175
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:39,080
He'd be like,
get the fuck out of here.

176
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,610
I've actually had,
I asked,

177
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,240
Noriega did that to me.
Manwell nory Noriega the rapper.

178
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,830
Oh,
evictor Santiago Maldef,

179
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,890
smoking cigars out of smoke cigars and
Don Koch,

180
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:54,380
and I'm not a cocaine user,
but I would have definitely,

181
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,360
you know,
my wife talked about going to Columbia

182
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:56,811
and I said,
honey,

183
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:58,100
I've never said this to you.
She said,

184
00:06:58,101 --> 00:06:59,450
what?
I said,

185
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:01,010
if we're going to Columbia,
we're going to do cocaine.

186
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,210
I said,
of all the places in the world,

187
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:07,910
I said,
no to cocaine everywhere from Dubai to

188
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:09,860
Denver,
but in Colombia I say,

189
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,570
fuck it.
We're here with the source.

190
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,830
Yeah.
When you're in Hawaii,

191
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:13,900
you eat poi.
Yeah.

192
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,810
You know,
you go to a Luau.

193
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,850
I would try for sure.
Those leaves the chewing of the Columbia

194
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,800
and Peru when you,
as you ascend up the mountain of shots

195
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:25,730
out there,
mortal technique.

196
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:28,220
My Peruvian raw rap friends.
I love that too.

197
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,090
Yeah,
I do too.

198
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,953
I stayed,
man,

199
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,840
he's been on a couple of times.
He's a great guy and a great human

200
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:33,674
being,
man.

201
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,810
Dude,
that guy brought me a plate of his

202
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:40,811
grandma's food to the podcast studio.
That's how down home that dude is.

203
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,970
He's one of the best movies,
a plate of food.

204
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,070
He's a great human man.
Like he's a great,

205
00:07:46,071 --> 00:07:48,260
he like,
that's more of the stuff I'm saying

206
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:52,070
people need to do instead of arguing
ideas and extreme do you need to get

207
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:55,820
with people who don't look like you are
not culturally a light and you need to

208
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:58,580
allow them to do things like that
because that creates friendships,

209
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,740
empathy and builds bridges instead of
burning.

210
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,060
Well,
he's just a real dude.

211
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,530
He is.
He's a real dude.

212
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:06,140
Like who he is.
I mean that is who he is.

213
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:11,141
He's got very strict ethics in his mind.
He's essentially smart.

214
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:15,770
He's like a soldier in terms of he how
he thinks and operates and takes care of

215
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:17,360
his people and moves.
You know,

216
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,110
he took me on my first tour with rap
music as what?

217
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:23,360
Rap Music before me and Ella went out
together.

218
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,100
I went out with him,
you know what I mean?

219
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:27,650
And we ran through the south together
and I just,

220
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:30,440
he was just pro all the way and we
became friends and I just love him to

221
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:32,510
death now.
And I go to war with them any day.

222
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,520
Yeah.
He's a great dude.

223
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,020
I've hung out with him a few times,
like him a lot.

224
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,060
He came to my mother's funeral.
God bless his soul,

225
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:38,930
Teddy.
Really?

226
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,010
Yeah.
I believe that.

227
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,200
That sounds like him.
Yeah.

228
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,101
Yeah.
It's a,

229
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:44,360
there's good people out there,
man.

230
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,750
Even in show business,
wacky ass show business people.

231
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:49,700
Yeah.
There are good people who shelby is none

232
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:51,260
of the people in the officer's you can
trust,

233
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:52,370
but the talent,
we're okay.

234
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,650
Yeah.
Well the officer's,

235
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,950
there's some folks out there,

236
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,650
there's some good agents and good
pieces.

237
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,160
They get a bad rap.
You know what it is,

238
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:01,050
man,
it's just fucking hard.

239
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,840
QMAP imagine how hard it is and you know
how hard it is to make it in,

240
00:09:04,841 --> 00:09:06,710
in entertainment as a performer.
Yeah.

241
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,160
Right.
You know your path.

242
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,930
Oh,
it's fucking difficult for everybody.

243
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:15,110
Now imagine you have to rely on other
people performing and you have to pick

244
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:17,150
the winners.
You've got to figure out who's the,

245
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,460
who's going to work for you.
A bunch of addicts and emos like in

246
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:21,670
terms of the tablet,
like we're,

247
00:09:21,671 --> 00:09:22,200
we're,
we're,

248
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,880
I know,
I give my managers headaches three,

249
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:25,860
four days a week.
God bless your soul.

250
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,420
You know what I mean?
I know I do.

251
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,120
I really like my friend today,
he was with me.

252
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,410
Um,
he's a promoter,

253
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:32,570
a he,
right Eric Mail House.

254
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:34,590
So when I met him,
we were doing a show,

255
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,320
we were booked to do a show,
um,

256
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,100
me and another artist,
well,

257
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,380
the other artists' contract didn't say
pay regardless,

258
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:41,520
mindset pay regardless.

259
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,690
So after the show and I wish my fucking
money and everyone's like,

260
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:46,071
what?
What are,

261
00:09:46,071 --> 00:09:47,210
what are you talking about?
You don't get paid.

262
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:47,681
I was like,
no,

263
00:09:47,681 --> 00:09:50,340
I was my fucking money or I think it may
have been before,

264
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:53,580
like I'm not going on.
And he ends up snatching me in another

265
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:54,001
office.
Like,

266
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:56,850
look,
I want to fucking pay you don't tell the

267
00:09:56,851 --> 00:09:58,610
other fucking guy.
Oh Jesus.

268
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,270
It.
And that's how we became friends.

269
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,300
I took my mind,
acted like I didn't get paid,

270
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,930
talk shit about them in front of the
other guy.

271
00:10:05,931 --> 00:10:07,170
And they call them later like,
man,

272
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:09,080
I don't know what the fuck made you hold
cold,

273
00:10:09,081 --> 00:10:10,590
but thank you.
And we've been friends.

274
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:12,880
And so when he called me and said,
you're going to Joe Rogan's experience,

275
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,800
I'm like,
you're coming with me.

276
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,200
That's hilarious.
Yeah.

277
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:18,570
I'm those sketchy gigs.
We not sure if you're going to get paid.

278
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,130
I know it's the Chitlin circuit,
you know,

279
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,010
it's like me and T.
I play in Montgomery,

280
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:24,960
Alabama in 2003.
Wow.

281
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,110
It Chitlin circuit.
Wow.

282
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,940
It's fun.
The Chitlin circuit is fun.

283
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,310
I will advise anyone who,
who likes,

284
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:32,881
like,
you know,

285
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:36,180
you're like street rap to get to the
south and get to one of those small

286
00:10:36,181 --> 00:10:40,530
clubs with anybody's accepted and just
go watch those kids as they grow up.

287
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,090
You're going to see some hellified
shows.

288
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,250
Now,
how does a manager find a rapper?

289
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:46,770
How does like an agent find a rapper?
How does that work?

290
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,900
It works a lot of the local shows.
Yeah.

291
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,360
Local shows.
I will say like in Atlanta,

292
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,320
um,
meech and Ke Hu,

293
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,950

00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,520
their management for 21 savage,
they've been on the Atlanta scene for

295
00:10:59,521 --> 00:11:01,440
years.
Cultivating young talent,

296
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:03,150
whether it was grip plies,
rest in peace.

297
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,650
Um,

which was another group out of Atlanta
and all these kids were dope.

301
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,450
You know,
some worked out,

302
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:11,910
some didn't on group dot grip died of
cancer.

303
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:12,950
Unfortunately.
Um,

304
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,000
to nine members went their separate
ways.

305
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:18,090
We still are making dope music,
but then they found the kid in 21 that

306
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:20,850
they managed to help get to the next by
toy and congrats to 21.

307
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:22,590
He had a number one album a couple of
weeks,

308
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:26,910
but management usually comes from a
group of people who care and just just

309
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:29,910
want to see someone they're a fan of be
treated well in the industry.

310
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,430
So I really applaud music managers
because like you say,

311
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,880
placing your,
your own fate in your own hands.

312
00:11:34,881 --> 00:11:37,980
It's one thing placing in the fate of an
emotional addict,

313
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,980
which a lot of times the act can be
including myself.

314
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,950
Oh Shit.
That's the roller coaster ride.

315
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,450
That's a hard job.
This distress of other people performing

316
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:49,440
is brutal.
Yeah.

317
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,840
My,
I mean I've,

318
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,500
my publicist,
God bless her soul.

319
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,000
I thought,
I thought I killed her a couple times

320
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:56,140
this year.
You know,

321
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:58,600
she might have come from am I conserve
one of,

322
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:01,120
I have two publicists,
white woman and Katherine who's done a

323
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:03,580
lot of music publishing.
And then when I started talking about

324
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:06,220
topics,
have a black woman in Jennifer Farmer

325
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:08,560
who's a great publicist,
but she's also a publicist for like

326
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,330
former senator of Ohio,
Nina,

327
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,960
Nina Turner in Mega Church pastors.
So she knows she's helping me keep my

328
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:15,160
image clean.
But you know,

329
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:17,200
she didn't want me getting on
television,

330
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:21,220
talking about doing cocaine and smoking
joints and I don't do cocaine,

331
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:22,400
but it's just like if I go to club,
yeah.

332
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,780
Do coat and she's just,
you could just see her face sake.

333
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,710
[inaudible] oh my God.
And you know,

334
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,130
churches are calling,
they're like,

335
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,550
Scott supports Ar 15 so I thank you,
Jennifer for you,

336
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,530
for tolerating me.

337
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,520
She put,
she's got to understand that that's also

338
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,310
a part of why people like you.
Yeah,

339
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:37,390
she does it,
you know?

340
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:39,810
It's just,
it's just something to deal with their

341
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,890
work.
I get it.

342
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,480
I wouldn't want to be here,
but you have to do what you do.

343
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,030
Like that's part of what makes you fun.
Absolutely.

344
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:50,620
You know,
cabs know what they're going to get,

345
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,740
what it is.
No filter.

346
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,760
Yeah,
you got it,

347
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:56,620
man.
You got somebody has to,

348
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,290
somebody has to shake the box a little
bit.

349
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:02,320
Somebody has to be the kid that's
willing to poke the Hornet's nest just

350
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:05,590
to see how many of flowers,
my two of my greatest heroes,

351
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,810
when black people usually talk about
heroes,

352
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:08,970
right?
We talk about Martin,

353
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,660
Malcolm [inaudible],
Elijah Muhammad,

354
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,410
Mario,
Marcus Garvey it.

355
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:17,610
But two of my biggest heroes coming up,
we're Luther Campbell and Larry Flynt,

356
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,920
right?
Because in my lifetime I saw Luther

357
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,580
Campbell and Larry Flynt fight the
government on behalf of the American

358
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:29,620
people's right to say whatever they want
it to say.

359
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,810
So at the same time,
in my formative years,

360
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,970
I was learning to love the bill of
rights,

361
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:36,190
the preamble,
and you had to say its constitution,

362
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,610
constitution.
I got a chance to see people fight for

363
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,830
my right and I couldn't wait to be a
rapper,

364
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:44,320
just soccer curse and by my own titty
books.

365
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,650
You know what I mean?
And those people have shaped my life in

366
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:50,710
terms of love,
of freedom and liberties as much as the

367
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:51,850
Thurgood Marshall,
you know,

368
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:52,684
as,
as much as,

369
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,790
as much as a Barbara Jordan,
as much as a,

370
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,190
as a Shirley Chisholm.
So for me,

371
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,930
who I am is needed,
you know,

372
00:13:58,931 --> 00:13:59,470
it's,
it's an,

373
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,730
I remember one of my friends saying,
Mike,

374
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,400
I like the fact you're talking on social
issues.

375
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,000
Um,
but why do you always feel necessarily

376
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,610
talk about smoking Weed and Strip clubs?
I say,

377
00:14:07,611 --> 00:14:08,830
because that's what I really do.

378
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,340
And I never want someone to be able to,
from the other side to say,

379
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,190
don't like this guy because he smokes
marijuana.

380
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,540
Go to strip clubs.
I want whoever they say that to to say,

381
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,770
yeah.
And he goes with his wife and they

382
00:14:17,771 --> 00:14:20,770
smoked together.
I don't want it to be some secret I

383
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:22,510
keep,
I want people to understand that when I

384
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:26,170
want you to be free,
I don't want you to be free to agree to

385
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:28,930
see the world the way I do.
I want you to be free to live as you

386
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:30,910
would like to live.
So long as it doesn't infringe on me and

387
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,100
others.
That's supposed to be what this is all

388
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:34,120
about.
Yeah.

389
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,620
It's supposed to.
What this country's all about.

390
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,870
That's what Ms. Ellis,
he told them.

391
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,440
Yeah.
In high school.

392
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,870
Well,
the Luther Campbell thing was so strange

393
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:42,850
because it was at one area in Florida,
right,

394
00:14:42,851 --> 00:14:45,400
where they had very strict brass
blasphemy laws.

395
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,370
Yeah.
They've tried porn stars there before.

396
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:51,040
Yeah.
They tried some male porn star was doing

397
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,750
really fucked up videos.
They tried him down there for,

398
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,030
for obscenity,
and they had him locked up.

399
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:56,810
They,
they,

400
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,060
you know,
it's very conservative and they just

401
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:01,310
decided that the two live crew was just
too much.

402
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:02,690
They were like,
they were drawn a line in the sand.

403
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,210
Huge.
But it's a crazy thing to do and

404
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:07,170
something's very popular.
You're like,

405
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,310
yeah,
but you know,

406
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,780
they also make examples out of the
popular,

407
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,180
yeah,
I just found out what the what the,

408
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,650
the mucky on a stick thing,
man.

409
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,680
What apparently monkeys in India while
out.

410
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,890
So farmers will kill unlucky and put his
head on six while the markets and all,

411
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:23,030
hey,
this is dangerous to do.

412
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:25,640
Right.
So essentially famous people,

413
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,200
I mean me,
you Luther Campbell,

414
00:15:27,201 --> 00:15:29,900
Lenny Bruce,
you know Rodney Dangerfield,

415
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,741
uh,
Andrew Dice,

416
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:32,390
clay,
Richard Pryor,

417
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,170
anymore.

418
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:38,000
What you become is something to
symbolize what will happen if you dare

419
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:40,670
step out of line of social order.
So you,

420
00:15:40,671 --> 00:15:44,450
your head on a stick is,
isn't less about actually charging you

421
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:47,960
for crimes and more about keeping the
rest of the public and fierce and

422
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:48,860
lynching.
Yeah.

423
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:50,360
And a lot of times we don't want to say
that,

424
00:15:50,361 --> 00:15:51,860
but it really is,
you know what I mean?

425
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,110
So do you think they see something like
two live crew come up?

426
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,360
They never had a rap band,
like a nanny kind of band,

427
00:15:56,361 --> 00:15:59,180
like two live crew right there.
Word what's next?

428
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,730
So he's got the shit in the bud that
snippet into butter.

429
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,070
Put the head in the stick,
put the head on a stick right there in

430
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:06,080
the yard and,
and thank our luke fought,

431
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,550
I can remember channel two or five abc
or CBS and they were,

432
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,800
they were,
they were getting off the plane in my

433
00:16:12,801 --> 00:16:13,160
town.

434
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,110
I'm a kid watching this one up 1213
years old and the news reporters just

435
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:20,330
went tmz style,
just put it in her face.

436
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,570
And I can remember brother mark,
he's just pulling up a playboy magazine

437
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:25,870
and the titties,
I mean right there on the screen.

438
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,661
I'm like,
yes,

439
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:29,900
because it's lot of tea and the report,
I was dropped the camera,

440
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:31,010
you know,
trying to get it out.

441
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,400
But that's where,
that's what made me love the United

442
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,700
States constitution when in matters of
freedom of speech because I got a chance

443
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:41,880
to see it fought for an exercised right
there before me as I was learning about

444
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:43,490
it.
This isn't an interesting that really

445
00:16:43,491 --> 00:16:45,560
what we're concerned with too is
visuals.

446
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,810
We're not concerned with what people
write down,

447
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,360
what we're concerned with,
what people say.

448
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:54,370
But we're not like,
you could write that in a book and no

449
00:16:54,371 --> 00:16:54,690
one what?

450
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,280
You could write his lyrics in a book and
no one would get mad at up at that book.

451
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,860
It's something about them singing it and
people singing along to it.

452
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:01,790
Yeah.
People were like,

453
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,770
this is it.
We gotta we gotta stop the civilizations

454
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:05,030
falling apart.
We've got to stop this.

455
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,391
Yeah.
Well,

456
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:05,961
I mean,
you know,

457
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:07,760
songs,
vibrations,

458
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:08,740
humming,
you know,

459
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,970
meditation,
Your Hump,

460
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,300
you know that rhythm changes things.
It opens your mind.

461
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:15,530
It clears you.
You know what I mean?

462
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,820
Had it not,
you know,

463
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,800
had it not been for an artist like
little Kim,

464
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,530
would you have feminism in a way you
have now?

465
00:17:21,531 --> 00:17:25,280
Would you have women gladly celebrating
their sexuality and bodies if it wasn't

466
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:26,810
for her?
She never gets the credit.

467
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:31,490
Do you think people know how extravagant
she was and her time?

468
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,980
I think she doesn't get the credit she
deserves.

469
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,660
I think women know that it became safe
for them to be sexually aggressive and

470
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:41,270
free because of her.
The women that you know were coming of

471
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:44,450
age in our time,
but I don't think in retrospect,

472
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,710
because wraps young,
it's only 45 46 years old.

473
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,270
I don't think that,
I just think it's getting to the point

474
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,700
where we appreciate what we've,
what we've accomplished.

475
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,630
So a little Kim is going to become more
celebrated as the years go on her.

476
00:17:57,631 --> 00:17:58,770
Trina,
you know,

477
00:17:58,771 --> 00:18:01,620
Kaia choice it.
The boss,

478
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:04,320
like so many hip hop has been a very
fair game.

479
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:06,360
The women are very long time.
You know,

480
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,370
whether people want to know it or not,
you know,

481
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,380
you have,
you've always had to call her response

482
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,330
records in hip hop.
I get on there and the baddest

483
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:14,430
motherfucker in the world and in a girl
pops up behind you.

484
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,810
Nah Mother Fucker,
I'm bad.

485
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:18,420
Or you know what I mean?
Those records have been around forever.

486
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,630
So they've,
we've always promoted equality within

487
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,460
because it made money.
It made sense.

488
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,700
And women were the audience too.
It's pretty amazing that hip hop is

489
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:30,060
really only 40 something years old when
you really stop and think about that.

490
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:33,930
It's one of the primary sources of music
in the world.

491
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,480
Yeah.
I mean if you think about how many songs

492
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:39,240
are being published,
how many songs people are listening to

493
00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:41,220
and enjoying right now,
how many of those are rap?

494
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,050
It's a fucking giant number,
Matt.

495
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:47,070
If you could look at the whole country
right now and just a little light goes

496
00:18:47,071 --> 00:18:49,930
off when it's a rap song is playing like
woof.

497
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,150
And if you listen to wheeler walker jr
willow Arkan says the rest of the

498
00:18:53,151 --> 00:18:56,460
country music is just biting rap and,
and acting like they are so,

499
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,080
well I think it was a little bit of
that,

500
00:18:58,081 --> 00:19:02,670
but I think at one point in time it was
a little that a lot of rappers would

501
00:19:02,671 --> 00:19:07,020
look at guys like waylon jennings and
Johnny Cash and old school gangster

502
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,180
country guys,
outlaw country is way different from

503
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:09,630
them.

504
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,360
I love outlaw country.
You can't tell me Waylon Jennings,

505
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:14,100
Kris Kristofferson,
Willie Nelson,

506
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:16,500
Johnny Cash are kicking it.
Like that's what the fuck is that?

507
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:17,640
Right?
But that's,

508
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:20,750
and that's not the same as you
allocating and Nellie beat to your songs

509
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,640
and talking about cowboy boots.
And said air force ones not the same.

510
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:26,690
There's something about the almond
brothers midnight rider and you know,

511
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,850
whipping pulse that's radically
different than you just singing about

512
00:19:29,851 --> 00:19:31,230
your Ford and,
and you know,

513
00:19:31,231 --> 00:19:35,100
and rafting on dates with your chick.
Yeah.

514
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:38,130
I don't think people even understand
tied to the whipping posts.

515
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:42,720
You can't fake that song.
When they came at me about the NRA

516
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,440
interview last year,
every day I smoked a joint,

517
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:50,190
woke up and laughed and listened to that
record like every single day.

518
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:52,470
I just wanted you guys to know it didn't
bother me any.

519
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,020
My wife just told me to shut up talking
to you all.

520
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,260
We went shooting a lot more and we play
almond brothers whipping posts every

521
00:19:58,261 --> 00:20:02,280
morning because I had to remind myself
that this is normal,

522
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:06,630
that you are being done like this
publicly because you are disagreeing

523
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:09,450
with the system that people have agreed
to that you don't agree to.

524
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:12,300
And it's okay not to agree.
So the harmon brothers really got me

525
00:20:12,301 --> 00:20:15,690
through that segment and stopped me from
punching a lot of bourgeoisie black

526
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:18,540
people in the face.
Well,

527
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,390
you're a proponent of your,
your right to carry a gun.

528
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,900
Yeah.
And I'm a lover of 19 states

529
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,440
constitution as a whole of,
of,

530
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:27,990
of all our rights in amendments,
but in particular,

531
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,940
you know,
the first and second amendment rights

532
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:34,350
matter to me as an African American,
as an and as an American first foremost

533
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:37,290
as an African American,
I've only been free 55 years.

534
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,030
My parents were born and apartheid.

535
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:43,560
And as an American we are,
we are a country that broke off from

536
00:20:43,561 --> 00:20:45,600
what we felt like with the tyranny of
the monarchy.

537
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:50,710
And we did that because farmers and guns
dare to wage guerrilla warfare against,

538
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,900
at that time when the largest armies and
navies in the world.

539
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,970
So I honor that by continuing to be in
the spirit of the host farmers,

540
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,823
you know,
in the,

541
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,900
in the continuance of crispus attucks,
the first person to die in American

542
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:03,640
revolution was a black man.
You know?

543
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:07,120
So for me,
I would dishonor those patriots who

544
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:08,980
started this country and Christmas
attics.

545
00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:12,640
I would dishonor the lineage is an
African American who was only 55 years

546
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:15,700
in the freedom by giving government more
gun patch.

547
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,360
I just not something I believe in
government is people pro.

548
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,390
Part of the problem with giving
government anything is that they're just

549
00:21:22,391 --> 00:21:22,720
people.

550
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,210
They're not something special.
Absolutely not flawless.

551
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,380
Absolutely give People Power over you in
theirs.

552
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,680
They will,
I mean this is not saying we should

553
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:31,720
stockpile guns and point them at the
government,

554
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,880
but if people have guns it's way harder
to just take over.

555
00:21:35,881 --> 00:21:36,780
Sees a little.
Absolutely.

556
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,680
Absolutely.
That shit happens all the time.

557
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,020
And other countries APP does happen.
Absolutely.

558
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:46,150
People get occupied and governments turn
on them and governments changed the

559
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:50,020
rules and put places that were
democracies are no longer so absolutely.

560
00:21:50,021 --> 00:21:53,170
That's real and we're never far from it.
Is it safe as you feel?

561
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,130
You're never far from it,
but I think what we need more of is

562
00:21:57,131 --> 00:22:00,610
people like you that are,
that are a reasonable,

563
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:06,090
very educated in the matter of very
articulate person who comes from a place

564
00:22:06,311 --> 00:22:09,160
where they don't expect that argument
come from.

565
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:09,880
Yeah,
I understand.

566
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,340
You know,
like you think about left wing people

567
00:22:12,341 --> 00:22:14,200
are Democratic People,
progressive people.

568
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,790
You'll always think,
you know,

569
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:18,910
you think about democratic people
overwhelmingly being appreciated by the

570
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:22,390
black community and you always associate
them with being anti gun.

571
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,830
Yeah.
That's a common thing.

572
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:25,540
So when a guy like you steps out and
says,

573
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:25,751
no,
no,

574
00:22:25,751 --> 00:22:29,530
no,
I think it's a disservice to take this

575
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:30,670
right away.
Absolutely.

576
00:22:30,671 --> 00:22:33,130
If I didn't support it and fight for it,
I've been,

577
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:36,670
I've been an African American 40 40
something years now.

578
00:22:36,671 --> 00:22:39,550
Right.
I have known democrats primarily my

579
00:22:39,551 --> 00:22:42,070
entire life.
I'm from the south in particular in

580
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:43,480
Southeast Alabama,
Georgia,

581
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:47,290
Florida.
I have never known a black male Democrat

582
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:49,060
that was working class that did not own
a weapon.

583
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,300
Not that.
So I'm going to follow the examples of

584
00:22:52,301 --> 00:22:54,970
my grandfather.
I'm not going to listen to the National

585
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,220
Party and their rhetoric about the arm
in the population.

586
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,370
I think obviously we could agree that we
would all love it if we never needed

587
00:23:00,371 --> 00:23:00,970
guns.

588
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:02,050
Yeah,
of course.

589
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,460
Right.
Of course.

590
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,740
Who wouldn't?
I rather not need it than be prepared

591
00:23:05,741 --> 00:23:07,420
though and not be prepared.
Sure.

592
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,850
Right.
Better to have it not to need it than

593
00:23:09,851 --> 00:23:12,760
they did not to have it and re part of
the country I'm from.

594
00:23:12,761 --> 00:23:15,130
And what you do often.
Like I'm from a part of the country,

595
00:23:15,131 --> 00:23:16,780
I grew up fishing,
hunting and growing food.

596
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,090
My sister grows food,
don't get to as regularly now.

597
00:23:19,091 --> 00:23:22,510
Still fish occasionally shouts out to
Greg Street when our biggest tjx down

598
00:23:22,511 --> 00:23:24,130
there and so great fisherman,
right?

599
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,880
But this is this normal in my part of
the country as not having straws and

600
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,860
being able to smoke in public in places
like La is it,

601
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,960
it just,
it's not that big of a deal.

602
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:35,861
You know,
you,

603
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:36,580
you,
you know,

604
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,310
in my,
in my mind state a household should have

605
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:40,090
five guns,
right?

606
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:43,120
You should have a revolver,
a semiautomatic for a few and your wife

607
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:44,200
carrying out,
you know,

608
00:23:44,201 --> 00:23:46,020
in public you have a shot gun,
just go.

609
00:23:46,021 --> 00:23:47,870
This is a great all around going to
have,

610
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,880
whether it's burglars or vermin,
you know,

611
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:52,340
and you should have bolt action rifles,
some course case.

612
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:55,050
Got To kill your meat.
You'd have a semiautomatic rifle meant

613
00:23:55,051 --> 00:23:55,310
to,
you know,

614
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,620
defend against here and there just to
fuck off on Sundays and show your

615
00:23:57,621 --> 00:23:59,890
homeboys who was Dick Baker.
But what should,

616
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:04,130
what you should not do is give up your
right to own weapons or use them on

617
00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:06,790
people.
That's the thing about using them on

618
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,490
people is that it's so rare,
but so horrific and so,

619
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,610
so common for something that's so
horrific and everybody's against it.

620
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,320
But I don't,
I don't understand how you would ever

621
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,640
buy taking guns.
I mean,

622
00:24:19,641 --> 00:24:22,020
you'd have to take all the guns away to
stop that from happening,

623
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,840
but how are you going to do,
how are you going to do that?

624
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,150
Criminals are going to give him,
of course.

625
00:24:26,151 --> 00:24:27,560
Huh?
So was no way they'll,

626
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:29,300
right.
Regular people should probably not do

627
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:29,871
that again.
Yeah,

628
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:31,280
that's,
that's where it gets squirrely.

629
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:32,660
It's like,
how are you going to get those guns from

630
00:24:32,661 --> 00:24:33,860
the criminals?
You're not,

631
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,020
you're not going to,
you're not going to joke.

632
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,300
Well we can do though.
And I will say as an owner,

633
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,370
you get lazy.
Sometimes you don't train enough.

634
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,720
We should try.
And more.

635
00:24:41,721 --> 00:24:42,680
And that doesn't mean,
you know,

636
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,080
go try to be the quickest draw and you
practice it,

637
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,350
you know?
But what you want to do is make sure you

638
00:24:48,351 --> 00:24:50,420
know what you're doing with your weapon.
Make sure you know how to clean your

639
00:24:50,421 --> 00:24:51,530
weapon,
make sure you're not a story,

640
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:55,370
a weapon.
And I took my son and my nephew and I'm

641
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,140
shooting,
I'm about to start taking my 11 year old

642
00:24:57,141 --> 00:25:00,260
girl Michael shooting because I want
them to know what they do if they see a

643
00:25:00,261 --> 00:25:00,470
gun.

644
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,020
So we've already went through,
what do you do if you're somewhere you

645
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:04,600
see a gun,
how do,

646
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,090
how do you get out of that situation and
get other kids out of that situation and

647
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:10,250
let an adult know all that comes with
it.

648
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,900
You know?
And you know,

649
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:13,940
the strange thing to me is that my
mother,

650
00:25:13,941 --> 00:25:17,510
when she was in high school,
was actually taught how to shoot a

651
00:25:17,511 --> 00:25:18,111
rifle,
right?

652
00:25:18,111 --> 00:25:21,320
Because the NRA,
which is now vilified and hate it for

653
00:25:21,321 --> 00:25:22,850
four reasons,
some deservedly sell,

654
00:25:22,851 --> 00:25:26,630
some not.
They used to have big programs in public

655
00:25:26,631 --> 00:25:29,360
schools to make sure that children new
firearms safety,

656
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,600
so my mother's school and other schools
benefited from that.

657
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,780
I don't care if it was just that sheet
of paper that tells you the gun safety

658
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:38,540
before you went and age.
That was just a piece of propaganda they

659
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:40,130
did.
It was better for the overall public.

660
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,760
So I tend to say as Americans,
we've gotten away from stuff like traits

661
00:25:43,761 --> 00:25:45,920
in school.
We've gotten away from different options

662
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:49,070
beside funneling our kids in the college
debt and we've also gotten away from

663
00:25:49,071 --> 00:25:51,440
basic training such as balancing a
checkbook,

664
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,210
a basic home economics,
or how do you,

665
00:25:53,211 --> 00:25:56,210
you'd make a Lasagna at home by herself
and stuff like gun gun,

666
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,600
gun shooting and archery.
I think that if those things return to

667
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:01,520
public school,
you get a safer,

668
00:26:01,521 --> 00:26:04,730
more confident student body.
You get a reduction on things like

669
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:08,300
bullying and in bullshit and you get an
increase on self-propel interest of

670
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:11,570
children and you start to meet to grow
it scholars than excel.

671
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,890
But do you do,
do you really,

672
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,870
how was it going to stop bullying?
Just by knowing that more kids know how

673
00:26:17,871 --> 00:26:19,430
to use guns.
Guns don't stop bullying.

674
00:26:19,431 --> 00:26:21,440
No boxing class stops bullying pimps.

675
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,900
He said that no one wants to fight
somebody gonna fight back.

676
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,140
I think you're right.
I think for sure martial arts,

677
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,520
uh,
I know wrestling does it.

678
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,860
Yeah.
One thing you can do though is make

679
00:26:30,861 --> 00:26:33,800
people more aggressive.
Initially you had a lot of people just

680
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,730
getting into it and learn how to fight a
lot to get that far.

681
00:26:35,731 --> 00:26:38,240
It's like blue belt mentality.
That's why you get with your homies

682
00:26:38,241 --> 00:26:39,160
though.
You go with your homey.

683
00:26:39,161 --> 00:26:41,180
So you and your homies are just beating
the shit out of each other and you're

684
00:26:41,181 --> 00:26:42,920
not picking on a kid at lunch.
You know what I mean?

685
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,790
Like me,
Willie Spearman.

686
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,040
I remember six credit.

687
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,080
The thing is though,
man,

688
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:51,570
you'd get hurt each other.
It was a horrible video.

689
00:26:51,571 --> 00:26:53,910
Uh,
did you see I'm the one that,

690
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:55,380
um,
are uh,

691
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,260
who put it up.
Um,

692
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,750
what was it?
It was a one of those fight breakdown

693
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,810
videos.
Robin black.

694
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,940
Yes,
it was robin black to Steve's.

695
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,690
They get in a fight.
One Steve Chaos.

696
00:27:07,691 --> 00:27:08,524
The other,
Steve,

697
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,490
it's fucked up.
Two dudes have boxing gloves on their

698
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:13,770
friends and one of them knew how to
fight a little bit and the other one

699
00:27:13,771 --> 00:27:15,750
didn't know how to fight it all and he
knocks him out.

700
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:18,180
Don't do that to your whole head.
Bounces off the floor.

701
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,880
Yeah.
I think a martial arts in general is

702
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:23,160
great for kids to stop bullying because
you don't,

703
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,690
you don't have to worry.
And we look at this,

704
00:27:24,691 --> 00:27:27,900
watch this shit,
but this kid in the blue has no idea

705
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:28,180
he's doing.

706
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,350
That Guy Leans in with a jab.
We'll get this plat.

707
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,430
Oh,
that's so fucked up.

708
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:36,360
It's so obvious that Tommy to sleep,
he knows how to fight.

709
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,130
Yeah.
Like even when he threw a jab,

710
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:40,020
he like leaned in on that Jab.
That was,

711
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:44,940
unless that guy is a real asshole that
really needed that punch.

712
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,680
That's a fucked up thing to do to your
buddy.

713
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,730
Aw Man.
Like we got this kid leans in,

714
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,090
look at that kid knows how to Jab.
That's a real jab.

715
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,390
Here comes awful.
Next snap lights were about to go off.

716
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,610
That's bad for you kids.
And boom.

717
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,930
Blap good timing there too.
Kid drops it and,

718
00:28:03,931 --> 00:28:05,100
oh,
did you see what I put up on my

719
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:07,650
instagram today?
Not when was a kid who looked like he

720
00:28:07,651 --> 00:28:10,400
was more of a boxer then a Kung Fu guy.
Um,

721
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,790
it looks like the,
yeah,

722
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,500
I kicked him in the job.

723
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:17,470
It wasn't joe was a chest.
It felt like he hit chest to Kava.

724
00:28:17,471 --> 00:28:19,020
Teach them.
I have to go look it like,

725
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,290
yeah,
but he could have been got them in the

726
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,230
yeah,
look at this.

727
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,200
I thought he got him in the neck area.
Yeah.

728
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,680
I think it's a little bit of high chest.
Yeah,

729
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:28,350
but,
but humble the shit out of him.

730
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:33,810
And then he smiled and patted him on his
back front leg side kick yet why he did

731
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:36,900
it smooth.
That's one of my favorite moves.

732
00:28:36,901 --> 00:28:38,370
There's a big guy,
people never see,

733
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,950
uh,
just a great kick to the gut coming and

734
00:28:40,951 --> 00:28:43,290
getting the fuck out of doing this.
Let me get out of here.

735
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:46,140
That's how you get out of those Chitlin
circuit clubs when the whole club is

736
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:49,090
trying to kill you.
How many of those situations ever been

737
00:28:49,091 --> 00:28:52,600
in a good three,
two or two?

738
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,770
It was our fault.
Me and my crew really,

739
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,520
and two,
we were just in the middle of some

740
00:28:56,521 --> 00:28:57,660
bullshit.
We know what's going on.

741
00:28:57,661 --> 00:28:59,280
We had to get out of that club,
you know what I mean?

742
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,571
But yeah,
that,

743
00:29:00,571 --> 00:29:01,710
that song,
that's,

744
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,390
that's the only thing about the Chitlin
circuit.

745
00:29:03,391 --> 00:29:05,640
Fun Times,
great groupies bags of money,

746
00:29:05,641 --> 00:29:06,474
but you could die.

747
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:12,220
Now how do you guys start out?
You start out like is there a like a

748
00:29:12,221 --> 00:29:14,850
open mic night or something?
If a guy wants to become a rapper,

749
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,470
how do you get going?
Like to get on stage?

750
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,370
It's like I'm from the underground rap
scene and that I liked these cults rap.

751
00:29:20,371 --> 00:29:21,990
I like battle rap,
that type stuff coming up.

752
00:29:21,991 --> 00:29:26,220
So I was more out of the open mic scene.
I got to hang around the older guys in

753
00:29:26,221 --> 00:29:28,620
the cool guys and the drug dealers
because I can rap about treat stuff

754
00:29:28,621 --> 00:29:30,380
right.
Where's your and you take like a t.

755
00:29:30,381 --> 00:29:31,500
Ah,
he was always interested,

756
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:34,710
loved music and stuff.
But tip was a trap rapper from the

757
00:29:34,711 --> 00:29:35,221
start.
You know,

758
00:29:35,221 --> 00:29:37,440
he,
he was entertaining for the streets so

759
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,060
he didn't,
he didn't need to go to fucking open

760
00:29:39,061 --> 00:29:41,920
mic.
He just needed to be opened up on a mic

761
00:29:41,921 --> 00:29:43,120
and then allowed the greater public.

762
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,070
The hearing I'm saying,
excuse me,

763
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,100
I talk about him and I mean big boy
cause there are two of my best friends.

764
00:29:48,101 --> 00:29:51,550
So I know I got poetic license to talk
about those guys where I don't really,

765
00:29:51,551 --> 00:29:53,280
you know,
tread lightly with other rappers.

766
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,170
You never know whose feelings get hurt.
But so it was no need for him to do open

767
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:58,960
mics as much as just find someone who
believed in him.

768
00:29:58,961 --> 00:30:01,120
And that was um,
kp La Reid,

769
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:04,150
Dj toomp and gave him platform to create
the genre.

770
00:30:04,151 --> 00:30:05,650
Now known as trap music.
Me,

771
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:08,420
I came up more of how to battle rap
scene and out of the,

772
00:30:08,421 --> 00:30:09,640
you know,
go show your wares,

773
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,830
kind of like a comic.
You get up in front of everybody,

774
00:30:11,831 --> 00:30:12,970
do your shit,
see what works,

775
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,080
go home,
readjust,

776
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:16,480
come back next week.
So when you do like a battle rap thing,

777
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,250
we sign up.

778
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:17,610
How,
how,

779
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,900
how would that work those days?
She just threw you in the pit.

780
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,960
I mean it was like,
was like fine first time.

781
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,890
Yeah.
You show up.

782
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,460
Um,
I got my name,

783
00:30:24,461 --> 00:30:25,930
my name,
my nickname Scott.

784
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,240
Right.
My nickname was Scott or my family

785
00:30:28,241 --> 00:30:29,740
called me Michael.
Um,

786
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:34,450
my friends were the unruly scholars and
those guys were like just east coast

787
00:30:34,451 --> 00:30:36,520
rap.
One was from Connecticut and from South

788
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,450
Carolina.
It was family from New York.

789
00:30:37,451 --> 00:30:39,910
They could wrap their ass off.
They were like Rakim and big daddy came

790
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:43,960
and sang group.
They defeated a lot of guys may better

791
00:30:43,961 --> 00:30:47,170
records and then one day there was this
thing called green lights where people

792
00:30:47,171 --> 00:30:49,660
will play their music and then they'd be
battle each other.

793
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,150
My homies income and man,
you could just,

794
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,070
everybody who you thought was the
homies.

795
00:30:54,071 --> 00:30:56,500
Homies was just shitting on them.
And I'm like,

796
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:57,110
what the fuck?

797
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,470
I says my homies and my manager,
Rod,

798
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:01,960
gg Mcgee,
who I had just seen like a couple of

799
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,880
weeks ago,
he was the person that kind of pulled me

800
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:07,930
out of knocking around in a trap trying
to be a petty drug dealer into a studio.

801
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,000
And he was the first person to say,
Yo,

802
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,800
this kid could really wrap.
Like,

803
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,730
you know,
fuck that shit.

804
00:31:12,731 --> 00:31:16,990
I know he steals cars and you know what
I mean?

805
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,540
And he rides around,
do a hood rat shit with his ratchet

806
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:21,250
friends,
but he can really wrap,

807
00:31:21,251 --> 00:31:23,320
let's get him in.
So he was the guy that started bringing

808
00:31:23,321 --> 00:31:24,820
me in.
So it offended me.

809
00:31:24,821 --> 00:31:26,020
They were talking about my friend like
that.

810
00:31:26,021 --> 00:31:29,650
So I just start fucking off with their
heads paddle wrapping them.

811
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:32,530
And a man named double dee called me,
killed her that night.

812
00:31:32,531 --> 00:31:34,530
He said his kids are killer.
Mike's a killer.

813
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,940
And that's how I got the name killer
Mike.

814
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,400
Ah,
what a great story.

815
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:44,200
So the battle rap scene,
you would just get tossed into a pit and

816
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:46,900
how much time would you get?
This is in the nine is this isn't like

817
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:49,780
formal battle rap now.
Like battle rap has evolved like boxing

818
00:31:49,781 --> 00:31:51,490
now.
Like what I'm talking about is

819
00:31:51,491 --> 00:31:54,310
essentially cockfighting so,
but like when you would battle up,

820
00:31:54,311 --> 00:31:56,530
there would be no,
no time limit.

821
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,580
No time.
You just went,

822
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:01,390
you just went until you won the crowd or
the other guy shut the fuck up and

823
00:32:01,391 --> 00:32:05,710
walked away with his hand down.
What was a long battle rap man died that

824
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:06,700
night.
Those guys were still,

825
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:11,560
I literally took out four and five and
six and those guys were still trying to

826
00:32:11,561 --> 00:32:14,650
come at me before d who was fucking
built like you when?

827
00:32:14,651 --> 00:32:16,000
When?
When we were children.

828
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:18,220
You know what if it was like I was dean,
knock you the fuck out.

829
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,020
Just told everybody,
shut the fuck up.

830
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,510
This kid one.
So,

831
00:32:21,511 --> 00:32:22,600
and it was decided.
All right,

832
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,550
these spoken,
you know what I'm saying?

833
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,400
Dj Double d gave me,
my mom gave me my rabbinate.

834
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,220
It gets heated man.
I've watched a bunch of them online with

835
00:32:30,221 --> 00:32:32,340
dudes getting each other's face,
man.

836
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,243
My,
um,

837
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,290
my um,
my deep,

838
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,360
my Dj,
Dj track star keeps me up with the

839
00:32:37,361 --> 00:32:40,000
paddle scene and I couldn't do it like
as an older

840
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,970
man,
I'm just saying to myself like,

841
00:32:40,971 --> 00:32:43,310
Yo,
I was just how to fight somebody,

842
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:46,120
right?
Like straight the fuck up like you by

843
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:46,970
Dae Dae man.
It's,

844
00:32:46,971 --> 00:32:51,010
the disrespect is amazing but amazing.
It's a martial art of sorts.

845
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:52,550
You know,
it's a mental martial art.

846
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:57,320
The ability to stay self disciplined
enough not to wile out the ability to

847
00:32:57,321 --> 00:32:59,140
give it and take it.
You know what I'm saying is,

848
00:32:59,141 --> 00:33:01,580
I mean it's an art there.
If you've ever seen roast battle,

849
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,560
no roast battles.
What they're doing,

850
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:05,780
standup stand up comics with the same
principle.

851
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,510
They go,
well they prepare for it like sometimes

852
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,900
like weeks out and they tell them who
they're going to be battling against and

853
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:15,800
they write a bunch of jokes about each
other and just shit all over each other.

854
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,670
Ruthless joke writing.
It's on comedy central rickles worthy

855
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,320
shit.
Ruthless Shit.

856
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,220
That's ruthless.

857
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:26,000
That's what comedy should be.
It is that it's a rare place.

858
00:33:26,001 --> 00:33:27,980
That one spot where they're doing it
like that.

859
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:32,300
That roast battle is a rare place cause
it's like pure joke writing and fucking

860
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,850
meanness.
I got to check that.

861
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,140
That's called a,
what we call [inaudible] in the south.

862
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,710
Joe [inaudible].
Yeah.

863
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:39,260
Hey,
I made you all in the shit out of you.

864
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,910
Like that's when you're just,
you're just,

865
00:33:40,911 --> 00:33:42,850
it's roofless.
Are you saying Jaw Lynn?

866
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:47,860
Like w Joning Joan to John Chowning.
Joning John The lady.

867
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,341
Oh Yeah,
yeah,

868
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:50,480
like Joan,
but it's,

869
00:33:50,481 --> 00:33:54,260
but it's,
I think it's spelled j o n e j o.

870
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:55,990
AN like John Jones.
Yeah.

871
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,430
So yeah,
and they call it John.

872
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:00,380
I and there's parts like,
I think they call it that in dc too,

873
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,100
but I'm in cap and some other places.
What's called Joan and in the sound man

874
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:05,990
number,
what they dove that Joanie just talking

875
00:34:05,991 --> 00:34:06,890
bad about each other.

876
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,980
Yeah.
With comics it's a,

877
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:13,580
it really is a,
a martial art because you've got to keep

878
00:34:13,581 --> 00:34:15,350
it together.
Whether this person just ruthlessly

879
00:34:15,351 --> 00:34:19,830
shitting on your appearance and your
life and x relationships and divorces

880
00:34:19,831 --> 00:34:22,280
and mean people are rules such as life.
Man,

881
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:23,600
life is real.
Yeah.

882
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:27,560
I gotta give props out to my friend
who's a comic little deval number one

883
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:31,040

Lil Duval is one of those guys where

884
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,380

885
00:34:33,381 --> 00:34:34,580

He's going to test you in nuts.

886
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,450
He goes,

889
00:34:37,771 --> 00:34:40,970
He's about this high,
but it's fucking ego is this big and

890
00:34:40,971 --> 00:34:43,820
he's really good at talking shit.
So I've heard him destroy some rooms.

891
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,100
He um,

00:34:46,101 --> 00:34:47,250
fighters in the UFC.

00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:51,230
Came out to that,
came out to that song loud smile bitch.

894
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,270
That's a great fun.
I'm very proud of my friend man.

895
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,480
It's a great fucking song.
Any Song Snoop jumps on

896
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,010
and style bender as he's getting ready
to go into the octagon.

897
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:03,380
He was dancing,
he was dancing to the song and when he

898
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:05,210
got inside he was dancing,
having a good time.

899
00:35:05,211 --> 00:35:08,720
And then once the fight started that,
I don't know if you ever seen him fight.

900
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,840
He's in the Matrix.
He's on another level,

901
00:35:11,841 --> 00:35:14,100
like spectacular stryker,
his kid,

902
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,090
I got to see him.
I haven't lightening fast and credible

903
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:19,790
timing.
He's got creativity.

904
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:22,010
He's loose in there.
He gives you looks,

905
00:35:22,011 --> 00:35:24,410
you don't know what the fuck has
happened and Blam you get head kicked.

906
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:27,200
He's phenomenal.
He's like one of the best in the world

907
00:35:27,201 --> 00:35:28,070
right now.
Up and coming.

908
00:35:28,071 --> 00:35:29,030
But he came down.

909
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:29,983
Yeah,
I gotta check them out.

910
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:34,040
Israel at his Sanya Israel Allisanya one
of the best.

911
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,350
He's fucking,
if you love technique,

912
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,210
you love that guy.
Shout them out.

913
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,980
I liked silver for that reason.
Yeah.

914
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,270
Well Anderson Silva and him are
fighting.

915
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,493
Oh Shit.
Yeah.

916
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:47,100
It's a sort of a passive,
he's 40 years old,

917
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:47,970
I believe.
Oh Shit.

918
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,950
Yeah.
It's probably one of his last fights.

919
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,050
I was about to say.
How old do you think I should be before

920
00:35:52,051 --> 00:35:52,884
they,
they stop.

921
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:53,731
Well,
you know,

922
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:56,880
Anderson is not a guy who,
uh,

923
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,510
engaged in trench warfare.
He always fought very smart.

924
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,190
He did.
He didn't really take the kind of

925
00:36:02,191 --> 00:36:06,330
beatings that maybe a lot of guys that
fought as long as him took.

926
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,480
He's very technical,
very good at avoiding getting hit.

927
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,320
I mean,
he's been hit,

928
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,840
it's unavoidable.
He's finding the best in the world

929
00:36:12,841 --> 00:36:13,440
continually.

930
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,360
He got hit,
he got dropped by a couple of people.

931
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,510
But um,
it's not like most guys,

932
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:21,390
but most guys that get to his amount of
time in,

933
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,370
they're going to get hit way more.
He doesn't,

934
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:27,300
I mean his face looks exactly the same.
It looks perfect.

935
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,660
He doesn't have a messed up face at all.
You think about that guy,

936
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:34,410
the fact that he fought the best of the
best forever and his fate.

937
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,273
I go,
thank you.

938
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:37,170
His face isn't fucked up.
I mean,

939
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,640
that's all you need to know.
This is what it is.

940
00:36:38,641 --> 00:36:41,790
Face Floyd's copy without about floyd.
Like people,

941
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,310
people hate to get mad with flood.
I'm just like,

942
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:45,600
Yo man,
you know,

943
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:50,100
defense is a part of voxer to man.
The ability not to get hit as a talent.

944
00:36:50,101 --> 00:36:51,420
Not a lot of people have,
dude.

945
00:36:51,421 --> 00:36:52,530
It's,
it's a part of everything.

946
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,670
Yeah,
it's part of life,

947
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,450
but it's,
it's a part of a Jujitsu.

948
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,920
It's giant.
Hixon Gracie is number one principle.

949
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,410
He's like,
first I'd defend,

950
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:05,020
I'm always safe no matter what.
Always safe.

951
00:37:05,021 --> 00:37:07,830
Always say oh ways he can't do shit with
him.

952
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,980
There's certain guys that allow you
Hickson one of them.

953
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,930
He would allow black belts to take his
back and put in a full rear naked choke

954
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,030
with the hooks in and they would start
from there.

955
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,310
Start from the closing sequence.
You're at [inaudible] you're going to

956
00:37:22,311 --> 00:37:23,340
sleep.
Exactly.

957
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,470
And he would get out.
That's amazing.

958
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,860
And dudes can tap them from the NASA.
Yo shout out to Wiz Wiz.

959
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,050
Wiz Khalifa.
Cousin Bri.

960
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,340
Yeah.
Shouts out the breeze.

961
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:37,110
Breeze got into Jujitsu and is brought
whizz into it and it's now shamed me

962
00:37:37,111 --> 00:37:39,300
into going to,
so at some point I want to pop up in a

963
00:37:39,301 --> 00:37:41,520
gym.
I've got to get you and Joey Diaz and a

964
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:43,850
Jujitsu class would be the greatest
thing I to get this done,

965
00:37:43,851 --> 00:37:45,500
the shelter,
I've got to finish rehabbing carrot.

966
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,970
It's going to clear me when I don't know
what your shoulder's rotator cuff

967
00:37:47,971 --> 00:37:49,770
surgery on both shoulders.
Jesus.

968
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:51,390
Yeah,
but I can do this again now.

969
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,020
Okay.
Yeah,

970
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,910
I can grab,
but again,

971
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,570
they got you doing those elastic bands
exercises,

972
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,510
those in the room,
those this morning.

973
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:02,490
Wiz put on a ton of muscle.
There's a photo of him pre and post and

974
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:04,240
it's truly impressed.
Sure.

975
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,150
I would not want to follow Wiz Khalifa
Ryan.

976
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:08,820
Now he's not just a thin,
tall kid rapping can shred.

977
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,230
Is he good?
ABS are ridiculous.

978
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,380
Give you kicks and take your bitch at
this point.

979
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,770
Have you seen his abs there would kill
us.

980
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,090
There's huge too.
Like look at that,

981
00:38:18,091 --> 00:38:19,050
look at it.
They're not just,

982
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,680
they're not just ripped.
I'm going to stop slobbering soon.

983
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:26,380
They're not just rip their big like look
how much power.

984
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:30,000
The advantage of going from skinny to
big though versus me.

985
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:33,990
Why it's times a muscle under here but
got to lose a lot of Chubby to see it

986
00:38:33,991 --> 00:38:37,240
baby,
your legs carrying around all that

987
00:38:37,241 --> 00:38:38,770
weight.
I've always thought if someone could

988
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:41,500
lose weight once they're really heavy,
they would have an advantage of their

989
00:38:41,501 --> 00:38:42,570
legs.
Calves are still good,

990
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,820
but the legs are constantly used to
moving around with much more weight.

991
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,270
Now all of a sudden they don't have that
way.

992
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:50,560
It's like he'd been backpack training.
Like what are the difference?

993
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,890
Well that's,
that's not as good at difference.

994
00:38:52,891 --> 00:38:54,340
It's hard to tell them.
No big difference.

995
00:38:54,341 --> 00:38:57,650
Still a difference there for sure.
Which is those a great human being.

996
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:02,080
He goes to that a place in um,
in Hollywood,

997
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,150
um,
Jay's place

998
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,390
performance.
Uh,

999
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,070
what is it called?
Unbreakable.

1000
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:13,360
The places the shit.
Supposedly it's like a semi private

1001
00:39:13,361 --> 00:39:15,730
place and be going there like chuck
Liddell's working out.

1002
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,800
And that makes sense cause we,
this is like really rich.

1003
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:18,783
Yeah.
Yeah.

1004
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,430
Like the black community,
he's like white people rich as well.

1005
00:39:21,431 --> 00:39:23,720
We call it white.
He's on,

1006
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,940
he's on a very high level right now.
God bless.

1007
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,130
Yeah.
I like with,

1008
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:31,000
well if you did that to your body,
that dude works hard while I'm doing it,

1009
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:33,790
I'm doing it slower.
I need to pick up the pace and go a full

1010
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:36,280
90 days like you say,
but I feel a lot better.

1011
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,590
I just did a fucking sap.
I was running commercial.

1012
00:39:38,591 --> 00:39:40,180
I felt like the king of the world.
Did you?

1013
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,073
Yeah.
Yeah.

1014
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,910
I mean I've been working out.
Miss shouts out to Al Clay,

1015
00:39:42,911 --> 00:39:45,130
barred from Clay Morphett effects.
Now,

1016
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,710
former professional bodybuilder.
Just teach me kind count how to retrain

1017
00:39:47,711 --> 00:39:49,690
my brain and when I'm not being lazy and
really on it.

1018
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,180
Feel great sweat today so you don't
regret the day.

1019
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,850
The good thing about it too is with a
guy like you,

1020
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,300
if you continue and you continue to lose
weight and get healthier,

1021
00:39:58,301 --> 00:40:00,220
you're going to inspire other people to
do the same thing.

1022
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,680
People that are your fans that go,
fuck man,

1023
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,540
now I want to get my shit together.
Yeah,

1024
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:06,750
cause what you don't want to do is get
rich dad.

1025
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,220
Have some young Wiz Khalifa like I
fucking on your wife.

1026
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,280
That's my daily mantra.
That's a good,

1027
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:15,910
I got a hot red hair wife and I don't
want to die all my money.

1028
00:40:15,911 --> 00:40:18,610
Go to some young steadman like God
fucking honor.

1029
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,450
Yeah man.
You want to have more energy?

1030
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,380
Fuck it.
You can do it.

1031
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,190
Yeah.
No,

1032
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,210
no doubt.
No doubt.

1033
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,800
But yeah,
what you said is true.

1034
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,380
Get off the sugars,
go out the flowers,

1035
00:40:31,381 --> 00:40:33,120
eat,
eats meat and grain shit tree on it.

1036
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,670
That's it.
Keep moving as much as he ever use one

1037
00:40:36,671 --> 00:40:38,110
of those fitbit's or any of those
things.

1038
00:40:38,111 --> 00:40:40,180
And now I gotta do I gotta Watch man,
man,

1039
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:43,570
my man from Nike gave me a watch it,
I gotta like I was a good,

1040
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,560
it was real good.
They,

1041
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,970
they'll,
it gives you a number.

1042
00:40:45,971 --> 00:40:48,970
So you look at the numbers and you get
the metric of how hard you're working.

1043
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,790
Yeah.
I like that one that we were doing.

1044
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:54,330
What the fuck was it called again?
The one that we did for the uh,

1045
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,930
fitness.
Yeah.

1046
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:59,620
I'm trying to by zones,
trying to convince my wife that having

1047
00:40:59,621 --> 00:41:00,550
threesomes enforce them.

1048
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:02,190
It's like circuit training.
It is.

1049
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:05,620
She hasn't went for it yet.
It was definitely a hormonal buildup.

1050
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:06,051
Yeah.
Well,

1051
00:41:06,051 --> 00:41:07,690
I'm going,
I'm going for it.

1052
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,190
I'm trying.
It's trying to,

1053
00:41:09,191 --> 00:41:10,870
I think next season,
all the trigger warning,

1054
00:41:10,871 --> 00:41:12,770
that's what I'm going to do.
I'm going to try to start a polygamous

1055
00:41:12,771 --> 00:41:14,710
compound based on cross fit.
Man.

1056
00:41:14,711 --> 00:41:18,370
That never goes right.
Is anybody ever pulled off a compound?

1057
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,631
Yeah.
Yeah.

1058
00:41:19,631 --> 00:41:20,710
A few people.
Quiet,

1059
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,090
quiet.
People pull it off.

1060
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:25,750
When you start to realize that your
uncle and your aunt and her best friend

1061
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:27,070
aren't uncle,
aunt best friend,

1062
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,690
like,
Oh shit,

1063
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,160
I don't had two wives.
You know what I mean?

1064
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,521
Yeah,
but,

1065
00:41:31,521 --> 00:41:32,950
but,
but if you're getting loud about it,

1066
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:33,990
it's,
I just want to go back

1067
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,740
because people know about it.
By the time they know about it,

1068
00:41:36,741 --> 00:41:37,820
it's already gone bad.
Right.

1069
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:40,730
So there might be a lot of them laughing
at us right now.

1070
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,170
We know how to do it.
Yeah,

1071
00:41:42,171 --> 00:41:43,600
exactly.
We just keep our shit together.

1072
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:46,100
Don't tell everybody to just stay low.
Did you see wild,

1073
00:41:46,101 --> 00:41:47,420
wild country?
I did not see.

1074
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,254
Wow.
All countries,

1075
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,710
they bought a town.
They put,

1076
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,240
they took over a town,
a whole cult.

1077
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,570
They just started just importing people.
They brought him in on buses.

1078
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,730
Shut the fuck up.
Do they took over a town?

1079
00:41:59,060 --> 00:41:59,601
Yeah.
These,

1080
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:01,190
uh,
what was his name?

1081
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:03,770
I forget the guy's name.
I forgot a,

1082
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:07,090
was it an east Indian guys?
Say it again.

1083
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,450
Into the mic.
Raj knee.

1084
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,280
Yeah.
He had another name though.

1085
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,690
Did it?
What are they making?

1086
00:42:11,691 --> 00:42:14,780
Like textiles or something up there.
I think I may have seen part of this

1087
00:42:14,781 --> 00:42:15,890
high three in the morning.

1088
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,140
I don't remember what the fuck they were
doing for jobs.

1089
00:42:18,141 --> 00:42:20,450
I was just paying attention to how they
got these people in there.

1090
00:42:20,451 --> 00:42:22,910
They took homeless people and they
shipped him out there on buses so they

1091
00:42:22,911 --> 00:42:25,730
could vote from the town.
That gave them jobs and identities and

1092
00:42:25,731 --> 00:42:27,550
these people were extremely happy.
That was what?

1093
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:28,770
It was crazy.
It's like a,

1094
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,410
I'm sure up.
Some of them were troubled,

1095
00:42:30,411 --> 00:42:33,380
but for a lot of them they finally had a
sense of purpose.

1096
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:35,420
They just been taken into this place as
family.

1097
00:42:35,421 --> 00:42:38,960
So they made Utah,
they basically made a town in Utah.

1098
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:42,860
I've always suspected that.
What I did see part of this movie geek

1099
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,750
at three in the morning like,
oh,

1100
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:50,470
why is it that white hippie like people
trust Brown people with beards so much?

1101
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,360
Well,
they want to believe in enlightenment

1102
00:42:53,361 --> 00:42:56,690
and in all the media portrayals of
enlightenment and all of,

1103
00:42:56,691 --> 00:42:58,070
you know,
when people talk about mystical

1104
00:42:58,071 --> 00:43:01,580
experiences at an India,
it's always that part of the world that

1105
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,680
emphasizes spirituality.

1106
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,070
And the idea that the Hindu religion is
a,

1107
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,280
is a more ancient,
more compstats be ritual religion as

1108
00:43:11,281 --> 00:43:15,980
this all goes to the Indian yogi figure
is the white Jesus figure of white

1109
00:43:15,981 --> 00:43:20,000
people 100% so for white people who
don't know white Jesus in the black

1110
00:43:20,001 --> 00:43:24,680
community is a mythical creature that
has enormous power,

1111
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:27,290
right?
It's insane for anyone to believe in a

1112
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:28,850
deity that doesn't look like them,
right?

1113
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,850
So,
but in the black community were just in

1114
00:43:31,851 --> 00:43:34,370
love with renaissance paintings and
Jesus is white as fuck.

1115
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:37,640
All right,
so we have the same infatuation that

1116
00:43:37,641 --> 00:43:41,420
you're weird hippy art has with Indian
men with long beards and their Mr

1117
00:43:41,421 --> 00:43:43,230
System.
We have that white jeans.

1118
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:44,980
So that you've just helped me understand
why,

1119
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,330
because I've always wanted to like what
the fuck is it up?

1120
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,520
Well,
white people and east Indian people that

1121
00:43:49,521 --> 00:43:54,260
cause Vikrum who directed trigger
warning also has a documentary where he

1122
00:43:54,261 --> 00:43:56,840
creates a fake religion and convinces,
you know,

1123
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,550
white middle class people to follow.

1124
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,130
That is a crazy one.
The white Jesus one,

1125
00:44:01,131 --> 00:44:03,290
right?
I why Jesus is a motherfucker Bro,

1126
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:06,260
like late man,
I'm going to get me a shirt that says

1127
00:44:06,261 --> 00:44:09,320
white people.
One stay woke and and what I mean by

1128
00:44:09,321 --> 00:44:12,670
that is Western civilization,
it,

1129
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,290
it,
this is the latest phase.

1130
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:18,500
Like people have to understand there
have been many empires and

1131
00:44:18,501 --> 00:44:21,590
civilizations.
That was a time where molly and Africa

1132
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:25,130
and Kim in in Africa what the biggest
civilizations and colonizers on earth

1133
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:26,240
later.
Persia,

1134
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:30,530
biggest cock like you've had systems and
right now the West has just for the last

1135
00:44:30,531 --> 00:44:33,540
thousand or so has been kicking and
dominating ass.

1136
00:44:33,541 --> 00:44:37,650
A lot of what we see on the news between
the West and what we call the Middle

1137
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:38,560
East now,
what it was wanting,

1138
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,510
western perjury at western Asia,
this is thousands of years war,

1139
00:44:42,511 --> 00:44:44,370
you know,
you're hearing Islam versus

1140
00:44:44,371 --> 00:44:46,890
Christianity,
but it's really two ideologies that have

1141
00:44:46,891 --> 00:44:49,890
been fighting for thousands of years
over how to glove should be governed.

1142
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,240
So with,
with that Shit,

1143
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:52,800
man,
it's like there's no,

1144
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:55,020
there's no stopping this shit and it
split white.

1145
00:44:55,021 --> 00:45:00,021
Jesus springs out of that and kind of
goes everywhere in colonizes everything.

1146
00:45:00,571 --> 00:45:03,270
So you know,
the Church pops up with candy for kids

1147
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:05,340
bibles for you.
And by the way,

1148
00:45:05,341 --> 00:45:07,350
we're going to be gone a while,
but we're going to leave this guy here

1149
00:45:07,351 --> 00:45:09,030
on the wall.
So you know what the ideal,

1150
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:12,720
what God's son look like.
So if God's son looks like a dooby

1151
00:45:12,721 --> 00:45:17,040
brother and still does God,
God looks like Jim Morris,

1152
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:21,090
Jim Morrison with a full beard.
Straight the fuck.

1153
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,340
Wow.
Wow.

1154
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:24,870
Yeah,
it's really,

1155
00:45:24,871 --> 00:45:29,820
Jesus would probably a Tan guy with dark
hair and curly curly hair and Brown eyes

1156
00:45:29,821 --> 00:45:32,850
that was saying shit that the government
and the church didn't like.

1157
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,030
So they knocked him the fuck off.
Yeah.

1158
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,600
Why do you think that each race looks
for someone of another race to be their

1159
00:45:39,601 --> 00:45:40,434
advisor?

1160
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,860
Because I don't think people trust the
divinity in themselves.

1161
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:45,570
You know,
I think,

1162
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,360
I think that once you understand that as
human beings,

1163
00:45:48,361 --> 00:45:51,600
we really only looked different because
of subtle differences in atmosphere and

1164
00:45:51,601 --> 00:45:53,940
change and you know who you mix with
win.

1165
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:59,390
But I think that all those books that
are moms paid oprah to sell us of self

1166
00:46:00,121 --> 00:46:03,390
help and inward looking.
Reverend Ike had told my grandmother's

1167
00:46:03,391 --> 00:46:05,220
generation had in the seventies you know
what I mean?

1168
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,700
And I think that we're scared to turn
off the lights and at some point see

1169
00:46:08,701 --> 00:46:12,090
something divine within ourselves.
Because once you do that,

1170
00:46:12,091 --> 00:46:17,040
that requires you act differently.
And I think that people need to be told

1171
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:19,290
what to do.
Not that they actually need it,

1172
00:46:19,291 --> 00:46:21,600
but they want to be instructed,
you know,

1173
00:46:21,601 --> 00:46:25,800
versus knowing or going on a gut feeling
or experiment and getting something

1174
00:46:25,801 --> 00:46:26,130
wrong.

1175
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:29,130
You know,
my grandfather was one of the most kind

1176
00:46:29,131 --> 00:46:34,131
moral men I've ever met.
He was always gentle with children.

1177
00:46:34,261 --> 00:46:37,170
He only put a belt on my butt twice in
my life and shit.

1178
00:46:37,171 --> 00:46:40,080
I think he cried harder than that same
man at 14 years old.

1179
00:46:40,081 --> 00:46:41,850
Shot a man in church for kicking this
bike down.

1180
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:47,970
You know,
he grew up in between 14 and 54 when I

1181
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,400
was born.
And he had experiences that he had

1182
00:46:50,401 --> 00:46:55,401
learned to regret and he had dealt with
that and he had become something that by

1183
00:46:56,251 --> 00:46:58,050
the time I was a child and he was
raising me,

1184
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:00,570
my grandfather was divided in my eyes
almost.

1185
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:02,580
You know what I mean?
Not because he was perfect because he

1186
00:47:02,581 --> 00:47:06,390
was genuinely good and moral.
But as a 14 year old boy who had grown

1187
00:47:06,391 --> 00:47:08,700
up fatherless,
who dropped out of school in the third

1188
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:10,740
grade and who had,
who understood it,

1189
00:47:10,741 --> 00:47:12,540
that I must protect my mothers and
sisters.

1190
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:16,320
He refused to people that buy anyone,
even in adult to the point of putting a

1191
00:47:16,321 --> 00:47:17,490
bullet in him.
You know what I mean?

1192
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:21,840
So I think that a lot of times we're
afraid to see the divinity in ourselves

1193
00:47:21,841 --> 00:47:23,820
also.
Because then you have to acknowledge the

1194
00:47:23,821 --> 00:47:25,380
darkness and you'd have to deal with
that.

1195
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:27,450
And it's easier to get instructed by
someone else.

1196
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:30,160
And it's easier to see the evil outside
too.

1197
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,100
It's easier to see the ad.
It's tough to know I can't control it

1198
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:34,330
just happens.
Versus,

1199
00:47:34,331 --> 00:47:34,950
um,
I'm,

1200
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:36,940
I'm complying and I'm complicit in it.
You know,

1201
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:40,670
that's a,
it's also a consequence of,

1202
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,040
you know,
one of the things that bothers me the

1203
00:47:43,041 --> 00:47:46,040
most when people talk about people that
commit crimes or think about people that

1204
00:47:46,041 --> 00:47:49,280
commit crimes.
So much of who a person is as a

1205
00:47:49,281 --> 00:47:51,590
consequence of things that had nothing
to do with them.

1206
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:53,870
Absolutely.
They get had been born in a terrible

1207
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:58,380
neighborhood to horrible parents,
been abused sexually and physically.

1208
00:47:58,381 --> 00:48:00,410
And,
and by the time you get to them,

1209
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:03,410
they broke their life is already a mess.
It's a shambles row.

1210
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,100
And for you to try to,
to think that they are going to look at

1211
00:48:07,101 --> 00:48:10,250
life and just figure it out with no
assistance whatsoever,

1212
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,400
it's crazy.
It doesn't work like that occur.

1213
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:15,860
One of the weirdest things about our
culture is that we haven't put more of

1214
00:48:15,861 --> 00:48:19,240
an emphasis in finding the spots that
are there,

1215
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,620
the ghettos and the terrible
neighborhoods in this country.

1216
00:48:21,621 --> 00:48:24,590
And figuring out a way to build them up
and just make it even,

1217
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:25,820
we know you're out a way.

1218
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:31,080
We know unequivocably where jobs and
commerce are present and economic

1219
00:48:32,021 --> 00:48:34,780
opportunity and prosperity occur,
Dessa,

1220
00:48:34,781 --> 00:48:37,690
dramatic reduction and elimination and
gang violence.

1221
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:43,680
Yet we do not put resources into
building institutions that will create

1222
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:49,650
entrepreneurs' or work on a soft skill
so the kids can be working at and around

1223
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,870
production houses to the owls.
We put that money into prisons.

1224
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,660
Yeah.
And then we use prison labor to undercut

1225
00:48:55,661 --> 00:48:57,510
things like call centers.
Um,

1226
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,200
things like that,
that the jobs,

1227
00:48:59,201 --> 00:49:01,540
I mean,
it factories may need and we,

1228
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,880
we're doing a disservice by doing that.
We,

1229
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,430
and I always say we,
because we looked how our quote unquote

1230
00:49:06,431 --> 00:49:10,300
leaders and blamed him when so many
times we allow it,

1231
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:13,330
you know,
we allow this to happen by not paying

1232
00:49:13,331 --> 00:49:16,450
attention and not voting.
We allow it to happen by not raising our

1233
00:49:16,451 --> 00:49:18,310
voice,
even though we know someone in prison

1234
00:49:18,311 --> 00:49:19,390
and saying this is wrong.

1235
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,070
You know,
the last people,

1236
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,690
I don't,
I don't believe just for the record,

1237
00:49:22,691 --> 00:49:24,850
I don't believe in the big three.
The Abrahamic religions,

1238
00:49:24,851 --> 00:49:27,430
I'm not into them,
but the books I've read and they're

1239
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:29,230
amazing graphic novels,
I cannot read them.

1240
00:49:29,231 --> 00:49:31,270
Like I can look like a graphic novel of
sorts.

1241
00:49:31,271 --> 00:49:33,610
Right.
And when you look at the people who

1242
00:49:33,611 --> 00:49:34,870
Christ died with,
right?

1243
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:35,701
It was,
he was,

1244
00:49:35,701 --> 00:49:37,270
uh,
he was up there thieves.

1245
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,020
The last person he saved before he got
hired here,

1246
00:49:40,021 --> 00:49:41,620
it was a thief.
I was like,

1247
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:44,320
what's a confessed?
Steve was dying right next to him and he

1248
00:49:44,321 --> 00:49:44,891
was like,
you know,

1249
00:49:44,891 --> 00:49:47,770
we going to go on this together.
That sets an amazing thing.

1250
00:49:47,771 --> 00:49:50,860
So as you're serving your savior or your
messiah,

1251
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:53,800
you need to be thinking about who he
spent his time with.

1252
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:56,200
You know,
he was with liars and thieves,

1253
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,040
he was in the streets.

1254
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,900
He was what people were alleged to be
prostitutes.

1255
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:03,580
And I think that if we start to turn our
attention to those places and we put our

1256
00:50:03,581 --> 00:50:07,180
intentions and good there,
we do produce on the out on the other

1257
00:50:07,181 --> 00:50:09,640
side better.
But as long as we look at religion as

1258
00:50:09,641 --> 00:50:11,440
something that makes us holy,
makes us clean,

1259
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:15,250
washed us of our sins,
and we become pious that I think

1260
00:50:15,251 --> 00:50:18,040
religion will something be something
that's forever kind of harmful.

1261
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:21,160
It helped to create that.
And I think that that,

1262
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:25,240
that believing that some people are good
at evil doesn't allow us to say,

1263
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:27,100
well,
what could we do to fix those ghettos,

1264
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,930
fix all depressed areas.
Because for every ghetto where I'm from,

1265
00:50:29,931 --> 00:50:31,610
for every get all this in a city,
in the south,

1266
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:35,480
I can show you a mountainous region what
a trailer park dishes is bad for sure.

1267
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:38,330
And those and those.
And those kids deserve a life better

1268
00:50:38,331 --> 00:50:41,690
than oxycontin addiction and in turmoil
and pain to your right.

1269
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,340
100%.
100%.

1270
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,460
And I feel like there's money to be made
doing it too.

1271
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:47,830
I mean,
it feels like these jobs,

1272
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,010
I feel like.
Yes,

1273
00:50:49,011 --> 00:50:51,140
it's an ignored resource.
Yes.

1274
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:53,450
Yes ma'am.
I follow kidney turbo cheeses.

1275
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:54,890
Follow kitten.
A turbo.

1276
00:50:54,891 --> 00:50:56,270
Jesus in Alabama,
man.

1277
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,340
Oh,
anybody named turbo.

1278
00:50:57,341 --> 00:50:59,240
Jim's names turbo.
Jesus K.

1279
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,370
Listen man,
he's amazing man.

1280
00:51:01,371 --> 00:51:02,810
I believe he's,
I don't,

1281
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:06,200
I'm not a big confederate flag.
Just doesn't bother me as much.

1282
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,180
All right.
Not saying that you had to pass.

1283
00:51:08,181 --> 00:51:09,800
Just it's,
I've lived with it so long.

1284
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:12,060
It's kind of like,
all right.

1285
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,940
Did you,
were you shocked at all of a sudden it

1286
00:51:13,941 --> 00:51:16,580
became a bad thing?
Like with the Dukes of Hazzard and all

1287
00:51:16,581 --> 00:51:17,990
that?
Not while I was at Duke because it has,

1288
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:19,130
I have pictures of me.

1289
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,690
And what's the General Leon a shirt.
Right.

1290
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:24,100
Um,
I'm not surprised because you know it,

1291
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,420
my thing with the competitor of faggots
that side loss,

1292
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:28,450
right?
So you're flying a loser's flag.

1293
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:32,600
So I just never really bothered me.
But as I got older to drama,

1294
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:36,290
the drama that's been placed around it
has been amazing because if I'm not

1295
00:51:36,291 --> 00:51:37,970
going to change Robert E.
Lee,

1296
00:51:37,971 --> 00:51:40,070
the school's name,
we're not going to really be able to

1297
00:51:40,071 --> 00:51:41,840
change places.
It's going to be here.

1298
00:51:41,841 --> 00:51:42,560
You know,
it's a southern,

1299
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,090
you just kind of that it's going to be
there.

1300
00:51:44,091 --> 00:51:46,390
But Turbo Jesus as a kid,
I saw following.

1301
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:49,820
So my natural assumption is typical
redneck kid,

1302
00:51:49,821 --> 00:51:50,990
right?
Hella talent.

1303
00:51:50,991 --> 00:51:55,130
He can fix anything with a motor on it.
He makes these amazing Katana like

1304
00:51:55,131 --> 00:51:56,600
swartz out of riches,
right?

1305
00:51:57,230 --> 00:52:00,710
He's just an amazing kid.
But I see him rallying against kids that

1306
00:52:00,711 --> 00:52:02,930
uphold that flag and upholding,
you know,

1307
00:52:02,931 --> 00:52:06,560
anything that feels like racism and
nationals and he just wanted a more most

1308
00:52:06,561 --> 00:52:09,230
morally good kids I've ever seen running
around.

1309
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:12,770
And he's an ally and he doesn't look
like stereotypically anything you would

1310
00:52:12,771 --> 00:52:16,160
expect.
But that's the great part of this.

1311
00:52:16,161 --> 00:52:18,170
To me,
the great part of all of this country he

1312
00:52:18,171 --> 00:52:19,160
is,
you know,

1313
00:52:19,161 --> 00:52:23,160
as as polar opposites is people try to
make say a you and I,

1314
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,490
here we are together as equals,
you know,

1315
00:52:25,491 --> 00:52:28,310
here we are together engaging one
another as equals and we don't look like

1316
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:29,750
one another and not from the same
places.

1317
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,390
And I think that's just a whole bunch of
opportunity in that.

1318
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,260
You know,
I think that there's money to be made in

1319
00:52:36,261 --> 00:52:39,050
promoting that versus promoting division
in fear.

1320
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:43,670
And so absolutely you should be,
there is money in helping children be

1321
00:52:43,671 --> 00:52:46,310
better there.
There is in there and if we're going to

1322
00:52:46,311 --> 00:52:49,070
live in a capitalist system,
be a compassionate capitalists and be

1323
00:52:49,071 --> 00:52:51,300
the best you possibly can because we
need more of you.

1324
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:55,340
But just seems like something like an in
terms of something that we think about

1325
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:57,980
as a civilization,
we don't think about neighborhood

1326
00:52:57,981 --> 00:52:59,240
rebuilding.
No,

1327
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:03,500
it's not a primary concern even though
one of the biggest problems we have is

1328
00:53:03,501 --> 00:53:06,410
with crime and violence.
If you ask people what's the two biggest

1329
00:53:06,411 --> 00:53:08,060
things you're afraid of?
It's crime and violence.

1330
00:53:08,061 --> 00:53:11,900
Next be car accidents and cancer and but
crime and violence,

1331
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:13,570
you could severely mitigate.
Yeah.

1332
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:15,740
Can if she had all these community
programs.

1333
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,340
If you think about the amount of,
if they've,

1334
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:19,640
I bet if they calculate it out probably
a wash,

1335
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:22,610
the amount of money you'd spend spent
fix things versus the amount of money

1336
00:53:22,611 --> 00:53:25,040
you would save by not having as much
crime.

1337
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:27,090
I agree.
Roxanne Shawntay

1338
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:29,520
I saw her and I don't know shit,
so I'm just guessing.

1339
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,850
I eight south eighth anything is better
than what we're doing.

1340
00:53:32,851 --> 00:53:34,170
More prisons what we're doing it.
Yeah.

1341
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:35,970
Well that's the scariest shit we got
going on.

1342
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,390
The idea that someone's profiting off of
putting people in cages and that they

1343
00:53:39,391 --> 00:53:41,970
also lobby to make sure that there's
more laws in the books.

1344
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:47,240
I told Larry King early today that I'd
rather stop arguing over the second

1345
00:53:47,821 --> 00:53:51,600
amendment with people that I should be
arguing for amendment of the 13th

1346
00:53:51,601 --> 00:53:55,200
amendment.
We should stop arguing over guns and we

1347
00:53:55,201 --> 00:53:57,840
should start to say,
why does that 13th amendment have a

1348
00:53:57,841 --> 00:54:02,520
loophole that allows for slavery that
says slavery is illegal except for yeah,

1349
00:54:02,521 --> 00:54:04,920
to people.
People have no idea how much prisoners

1350
00:54:04,921 --> 00:54:07,620
get paid to work when they were working
on the fires.

1351
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:08,483
Yes.
What was,

1352
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:10,340
I think it was $2 or something.

1353
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:15,360
Some fucking insane amount of money.
They pay them and when they get out of

1354
00:54:15,721 --> 00:54:17,910
prison,
they are not allowed to be firemen.

1355
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,740
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

1356
00:54:19,741 --> 00:54:20,670
Is that real?
Yeah.

1357
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:24,180
It's real
like because you're a felon.

1358
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:27,900
Every crime it for everyone,
but,

1359
00:54:27,901 --> 00:54:30,150
but I any felony,
you can't be a fireman.

1360
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:32,970
I can't say any,
but a lot of the guys I've known that

1361
00:54:32,971 --> 00:54:35,620
have gotten out of prison have not been
allowed to apply for five.

1362
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:36,510
It's right.
There's,

1363
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,500
there's felonies where violent felonies,
drug selling California is paying

1364
00:54:40,501 --> 00:54:44,010
inmates $1 an hour.
Holy Shit.

1365
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:48,900
Not even $2 your life is worth 99
Pitney's plus one.

1366
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:51,570
Just stop and think about fighting fires
for 10 hours.

1367
00:54:51,571 --> 00:54:55,260
You make $10 that's insane.
That is that.

1368
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:59,460
Not only is that slavery,
that might be worse than slavery because

1369
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:03,720
$10 an hour isn't even going to buy you
food.

1370
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:04,860
That's what I said.
Walmart pays.

1371
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,710
It's,
it's less money to work all day.

1372
00:55:07,711 --> 00:55:09,750
Then you could feed yourself.
Yeah.

1373
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,750
Yup.
This is the white guy thing.

1374
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:14,610
That's,
that's what I try to tell people.

1375
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:15,960
People Talk Shit when I was coming on
here.

1376
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:17,253
All right.
I was like,

1377
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:19,560
Yo man,
these are the guys in ally.

1378
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:23,520
I appreciate you saying that because
that's true and it's not just black guys

1379
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:26,730
is poor white people.
I almost wish I could have a convention

1380
00:55:26,731 --> 00:55:31,320
with to say we got to say masters.
They're saying this right here.

1381
00:55:31,321 --> 00:55:34,920
More than 2000 volunteer inmate
firefighters and they volunteered,

1382
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:38,550
including 58 youth offenders are
battling wildfire flames through

1383
00:55:38,551 --> 00:55:41,580
California.
Inmate firefighters serve a vital role

1384
00:55:41,581 --> 00:55:45,030
clearing thick brush down to bare soil
to stop the fire.

1385
00:55:45,031 --> 00:55:47,150
Spread a wonder.
Um,

1386
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:51,300
do they get better service for that?
Do they they get out earlier?

1387
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,100
Nope.
They don't think nothing.

1388
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:53,963
I don't think so.

1389
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,670
I would hope they do,
but if we're paying them a dollar out,

1390
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:58,150
what do we care?
But we're,

1391
00:55:58,170 --> 00:55:59,400
we're like,
we are,

1392
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,920
the public should be up in arms about
it.

1393
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:02,461
Yeah.
Well,

1394
00:56:02,461 --> 00:56:04,800
they're obviously trusted those guys to
not run too,

1395
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:07,200
because when you're,
when you're chopping down bushes out

1396
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:08,740
there,
when there's a fire going on,

1397
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:10,340
but where are you?
Where are you going to go with it?

1398
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:12,600
Nobody knows what the fuck is happening.
It's chaos.

1399
00:56:12,601 --> 00:56:14,110
So where are you going to go?
Where are you going to go?

1400
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:17,580
Yeah.
And then when they get you shit dollar

1401
00:56:17,581 --> 00:56:19,860
an hour,
just how insane is that one?

1402
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,920
You know something else we do in our
prisoners that's cruel and brutal.

1403
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,570
We put people in a box of 23 hours a
day.

1404
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:28,060
Yeah.
A lot of math for an hour to walk in the

1405
00:56:28,061 --> 00:56:29,040
space.
Yeah.

1406
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,070
You driving him crazy.

1407
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,240
Yeah.
She doing.

1408
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,950
Yeah.
You're fucking with their sensors to the

1409
00:56:32,951 --> 00:56:34,510
point where they're going crazy.
Absolutely.

1410
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:36,490
They get solitary.
I,

1411
00:56:36,491 --> 00:56:39,070
I have friends that have been in
solitary,

1412
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:42,370
they talked to you about,
and they're just there for themselves

1413
00:56:42,371 --> 00:56:44,470
with your own mind day after day after
day.

1414
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:46,480
I remember going to in school
suspension,

1415
00:56:46,481 --> 00:56:49,090
not being able to talk about to go
fucking nuts after three hours,

1416
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:52,720
you know?
So imagine being in Georgia state

1417
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:56,920
corrections when you're a little kid.
You can't shut the fuck up for anything.

1418
00:56:58,030 --> 00:56:59,280
Coach dollar used to tell him,
you know,

1419
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,140
he used to be honest,
like shut the fuck Cameron dollar one

1420
00:57:02,141 --> 00:57:04,230
1995 ucla.
He played um,

1421
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,400
play point guard for them when they won
national championship.

1422
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:10,600
His Dad was the culture of high school.
His Dad was the basketball coach and

1423
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:13,390
he'd softer in school and I stayed in,
in school.

1424
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:15,360
Oh Man.
I knew his dad like a fucking player.

1425
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:17,710
I couldn't play any basketball.
I'd just be sitting there quiet.

1426
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:20,950
He'd be reading the paper just like,
I can't wait to get the fuck outta here,

1427
00:57:20,951 --> 00:57:22,570
man.
Coach [inaudible] home at and say Shit.

1428
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,040
That's how I knew I didn't want to go to
prison.

1429
00:57:24,490 --> 00:57:29,490
Thank you coach dollar shouts out the
camp not talking to anybody for just a

1430
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,450
couple of days.
It would be enough to drive you crazy.

1431
00:57:31,451 --> 00:57:33,910
And I imagine some people that had been
locked in the hole for like eight

1432
00:57:33,911 --> 00:57:34,720
months.
Yeah,

1433
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:35,800
they do that to people.
Yeah,

1434
00:57:35,801 --> 00:57:36,870
they do.
They break down.

1435
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:38,890
I mean that doesn't,
isn't that what they did to Chelsea

1436
00:57:38,891 --> 00:57:40,780
manning?
Yeah,

1437
00:57:40,781 --> 00:57:41,680
didn't they?
Yes,

1438
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,600
that's exactly what they did.
I think

1439
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,790
I forgot what her original name was.
I as Dua,

1440
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:49,360
I forgot.
No,

1441
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:52,900
it's not what you might change.
You might get like Chelsea else going to

1442
00:57:52,901 --> 00:57:54,790
say,
you might say piece of shit.

1443
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:56,440
It's always been Chelsea,
but yeah,

1444
00:57:56,441 --> 00:57:59,350
she um,
I think they locked her in the hole for

1445
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:00,700
like 10 months.
Damn.

1446
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,050
Yeah.
No talking.

1447
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,100
No.
Nobody.

1448
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:05,950
Just by yourself.
Fuck you by yourself.

1449
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,000
That's crazy.
I mean,

1450
00:58:07,001 --> 00:58:12,001
you could break someone's brain is tired
of people's brain gets broken on a good

1451
00:58:12,761 --> 00:58:17,350
edible.
As I watch first 48 I see.

1452
00:58:17,351 --> 00:58:20,770
Mother fuckers rang it broken 15 minutes
to cigarettes at a honeypot.

1453
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,590
Yeah.
That's another reason I tell kids don't

1454
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,920
commit crime or with your homies,
man.

1455
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:30,100
Watch first 48 you're going to see
everything go bad man.

1456
00:58:30,101 --> 00:58:33,220
For a newport.
Yeah.

1457
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:36,910
Just so many fucking crimes.
So many laws that don't,

1458
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:38,680
don't need to exist.
Poverty.

1459
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,860
We end poverty.
We fixed crime when that's a fuck load

1460
00:58:41,861 --> 00:58:42,720
of it,
that's for sure.

1461
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:45,430
Then I'd still be sociopaths and greedy
people that are going to have that,

1462
00:58:45,431 --> 00:58:48,850
but far less than crimes of opportunity
like Robin Moms,

1463
00:58:48,851 --> 00:58:52,660
if their persons that gas stations car
jackings you're not going to see stolen

1464
00:58:52,661 --> 00:58:54,100
cars.
You're not going to see burglaries.

1465
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:56,920
You're not going to see that.
If you start to have an influx of,

1466
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,290
you know,
we'd need to bring a lot of stuff back

1467
00:58:59,291 --> 00:59:01,380
to America.
We need to start making shit again and

1468
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:03,010
he'd start buying shit.
We make again.

1469
00:59:03,011 --> 00:59:05,770
We need to,
we need to start refocusing on what we

1470
00:59:05,771 --> 00:59:07,810
could be doing in house.
I think,

1471
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:10,480
you know,
I think that would certainly help us and

1472
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,740
I don't know what we could do,
uh,

1473
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:17,500
to sort of promote that idea of,
um,

1474
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:20,260
I mean,
why doesn't it,

1475
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:22,460
it's nothing that ever gets discussed

1476
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:25,000
in any political discussion.
Like when,

1477
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,650
whenever there's some debates going on
or whenever there's,

1478
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:32,090
cause we're being given an agenda,
but nobody ever thinks of that one

1479
00:59:32,091 --> 00:59:35,840
aspect of our culture,
the weakest aspect of our culture

1480
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:38,540
economically.
If we don't really consider it,

1481
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,520
you just look at it as a source of
crime.

1482
00:59:40,521 --> 00:59:45,200
It's a statistic we sitters as though
it's something that just is just has to

1483
00:59:45,201 --> 00:59:47,180
be,
but it doesn't have to be like that.

1484
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:49,660
Well,
especially if we know history and to

1485
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:52,310
tell them he shuts all.
I'm really trying to say like there are

1486
00:59:52,311 --> 00:59:54,640
other alternatives,
other ways to try this and,

1487
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:55,930
and we could,
yeah,

1488
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:59,510
you can't,
you can try to fix homelessness without

1489
00:59:59,511 --> 01:00:01,880
criminalizing being homeless.
Right?

1490
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,030
We know that most men that are homeless,
um,

1491
01:00:05,031 --> 01:00:07,100
have some types of mental illnesses,
schizophrenia.

1492
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,730
So that means that we've broken down and
we're not taking care of the mentally

1493
01:00:10,731 --> 01:00:12,890
ill in a way that we should be a could
be.

1494
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:15,650
So if you start to fix that,
you start to fix that kind of

1495
01:00:15,651 --> 01:00:18,140
homelessness.
We know that women and children,

1496
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:21,560
we know why they're on the street and we
know that if they're subsidized into

1497
01:00:21,561 --> 01:00:23,960
these types of affordable housing,
apartments in the city,

1498
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,060
the kids have the opportunity to go to
better schools,

1499
01:00:26,061 --> 01:00:29,150
to become better parts of society in
terms of having to networks and

1500
01:00:29,151 --> 01:00:31,580
resources.
We know the mothers are closer to work,

1501
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:33,440
can be home,
but we don't do that.

1502
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:35,890
We build cities.
Like right now we're developing Atlanta

1503
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:38,480
and we've been promised a certain amount
of,

1504
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:41,480
um,
of workspace in the city for working

1505
01:00:41,481 --> 01:00:42,830
class people,
for poor people.

1506
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:44,930
Some of the developers aren't doing what
they say they do.

1507
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:47,360
And because you do that,
you start to increase the,

1508
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:49,730
the things that are blights on us.
You know,

1509
01:00:49,731 --> 01:00:51,740
we just have to be really committed to
it and do it.

1510
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:53,300
And that's it.
And once we do it,

1511
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:54,740
it's done,
you know.

1512
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,750
But if we,
if we keep acting like it's not

1513
01:00:56,751 --> 01:01:01,751
happening and complaining about poverty
and crime in war and not doing anything,

1514
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:06,620
it's just the cycle never stops nasty on
the insanity.

1515
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:09,920
I really don't understand yet.
Well everybody feels like it's somebody

1516
01:01:09,921 --> 01:01:12,530
else's job.
Everybody feels like work like,

1517
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:13,790
yeah.
And everybody feels like,

1518
01:01:13,791 --> 01:01:15,260
well you just got to get out of that
neighborhood.

1519
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,700
Nah,
that doesn't work.

1520
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:19,860
That's what I was his work.
Roxanne Shawntay talked about reentry

1521
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:21,620
vacation.
She said,

1522
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:22,670
you know,
she,

1523
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:25,970
she doesn't want to hear people come,
keep complaining about gentrification

1524
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:29,360
when the kids that are leaving these
neighborhoods,

1525
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:31,250
whether they'd sing dance,
rap or not,

1526
01:01:31,251 --> 01:01:34,070
or just cokie could jobs and colby
decent human beings.

1527
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:36,600
You should be reentering your
neighborhood.

1528
01:01:36,601 --> 01:01:38,930
You should be buying houses or pieces of
land near.

1529
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:42,230
One of the most impressive things,
one of my favorite players are John

1530
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:43,760
Stockton,
and I'll know if it's true or not,

1531
01:01:43,761 --> 01:01:47,260
but I read a story that he actually
bought a house right on the street he

1532
01:01:47,261 --> 01:01:49,700
grew up in.
So in the Aussie that he go back

1533
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:53,870
essentially home with his kids.
So they'd had some type of normalization

1534
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:55,130
to their life.
We,

1535
01:01:55,131 --> 01:01:56,690
we should be doing it,
you know,

1536
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:58,130
um,
Tiana,

1537
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:01,160
I have bought properties together in the
same neighborhoods we grew up in,

1538
01:02:01,161 --> 01:02:03,770
were developing things like restaurants
and stuff.

1539
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:07,850
I like to see more athletes and rappers
become the merchant and business class,

1540
01:02:07,851 --> 01:02:10,460
net weight.
And I like to see people who grew up in

1541
01:02:10,461 --> 01:02:14,200
neighborhoods move back to those
neighborhoods they grew up in like,

1542
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,900
like the typical iconic American dream.
You know you can build a,

1543
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:20,220
you know,
another eight square feet in the back of

1544
01:02:20,221 --> 01:02:25,221
the a frame house if you want to,
but you shouldn't be going to 54 60

1545
01:02:25,291 --> 01:02:28,890
minutes outside the city in there
complaining about the blight of the city

1546
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:32,370
because you took yourself away,
you took the talent and the resources

1547
01:02:32,371 --> 01:02:33,204
away.

1548
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:36,540
Do you think that everyone should feel
that way though?

1549
01:02:36,541 --> 01:02:37,590
Or is it,
I mean,

1550
01:02:37,591 --> 01:02:40,350
do you feel like you have to be
committed to the city that you grew up

1551
01:02:40,351 --> 01:02:42,420
in or couldn't you want to just get the
fuck out of there and go somewhere

1552
01:02:42,421 --> 01:02:44,160
different difference?
Nothing wrong with getting the fuck out,

1553
01:02:44,161 --> 01:02:45,720
but you just think you should go back
and support it.

1554
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:46,830
Yeah.
It's like I tell kids,

1555
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:47,850
you know,
in college and they say,

1556
01:02:47,851 --> 01:02:48,331
Mike,
you know,

1557
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:49,021
what can we do?
You know,

1558
01:02:49,021 --> 01:02:50,730
kids in college gets,
when you go speak at college and say,

1559
01:02:50,731 --> 01:02:51,564
well,
what could we do?

1560
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:55,890
Kids want to affect the world very easy.
Fanned a kid in high school,

1561
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,620
tutored at Kit and make sure they
replace you at this university or

1562
01:02:58,621 --> 01:03:00,330
another.
I said,

1563
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:03,330
you're just used replanting a scene.
If you grow food,

1564
01:03:03,331 --> 01:03:06,680
you know you don't grow the same way and
you have to year after year some you'd

1565
01:03:06,681 --> 01:03:07,740
have to give that land a break.

1566
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:08,820
Retail it,
you know what I'm saying?

1567
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:11,250
It was kind of like the neighborhood.
So you don't have to stay in the same

1568
01:03:11,251 --> 01:03:13,080
neighborhood your whole life.
You don't have to feel like I never win

1569
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:16,260
anything or escaped anywhere.
But you do have to,

1570
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:19,400
don't sell your mother's house,
you know,

1571
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:21,480
rent it to your cousin,
you know,

1572
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:23,970
let you get my assistant but don't,
don't sell your mother.

1573
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:27,390
That piece of land was worked for the
blood to toil the soil.

1574
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,880
It means something and it should.
And,

1575
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:33,830
and for working class people especially,
it keeps your neighborhood and

1576
01:03:33,831 --> 01:03:37,290
communities more like the ones that made
you be a good human being,

1577
01:03:37,291 --> 01:03:39,390
you know?
So I think that there is something,

1578
01:03:39,391 --> 01:03:42,660
most people don't leave the town,
they grow up in and moved to the other

1579
01:03:42,661 --> 01:03:46,410
side or they moved to the suburbs for
most people or most people marry

1580
01:03:46,411 --> 01:03:47,310
somebody they knew.

1581
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:49,740
You know what I'm saying?
My thing is make the best of it.

1582
01:03:49,741 --> 01:03:52,290
Don't let it keep becoming a worse.
A man named Mr John,

1583
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:56,100
my wife and I own barbershops or people
don't know Yom distincts called the Shea

1584
01:03:56,101 --> 01:03:58,500
washing room shops.
We have one at state farm arena that

1585
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:01,440
when the Atlanta Hawks play,
we have our flagship store on age would

1586
01:04:01,441 --> 01:04:05,320
ave edgewood avenue was once an Auburn
Avenue.

1587
01:04:05,321 --> 01:04:08,970
When wants to centers of black Atlanta
in terms of commerce and retail and

1588
01:04:08,971 --> 01:04:11,020
money,
Atlanta life insurance company with

1589
01:04:11,021 --> 01:04:11,761
their,
you guys google.

1590
01:04:11,761 --> 01:04:13,710
Some of this stuff's,
it's big time shit.

1591
01:04:13,711 --> 01:04:15,420
You know,
this isn't the old narrative of we've

1592
01:04:15,421 --> 01:04:17,430
never had nothing cause that's not the
truth.

1593
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:20,100
And Landon was a very rich city for
African Americans.

1594
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:24,660
Still is on this street,
used to be owned by African Americans.

1595
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:28,230
The storefronts in there,
their children after these people.

1596
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:31,140
Dot off solar buildings off and sold it
for cheap.

1597
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:34,200
And I know this because many,
Mr John who runs the grocery store,

1598
01:04:34,201 --> 01:04:36,090
they stopped me one day.
He said,

1599
01:04:36,091 --> 01:04:40,740
you know Michael [inaudible] after we're
gone and this neighborhood's been

1600
01:04:40,741 --> 01:04:44,580
gentrified and everything's different,
they're going to come along and say that

1601
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,430
white people stole this from us.
And he said,

1602
01:04:47,431 --> 01:04:50,940
that's not true.
He say the children or the people that

1603
01:04:50,941 --> 01:04:55,200
were here left and they never came back
because they didn't think what they

1604
01:04:55,201 --> 01:04:59,550
parents bill was good enough.
Oh man to kill me because that is not

1605
01:04:59,551 --> 01:05:01,650
just black people,
less Americans period.

1606
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:06,240
We have gotten to a point where we are
unappreciative,

1607
01:05:06,450 --> 01:05:11,450
we are entitled and we don't think what
happened before us was good enough so we

1608
01:05:11,461 --> 01:05:13,020
don't treasure it.
We don't honor it.

1609
01:05:13,021 --> 01:05:16,620
We don't reinvest in it.
That could be a farm in Milledgeville

1610
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,770
that could be a house in Adamsville,
but we have to do a better job of

1611
01:05:20,771 --> 01:05:23,870
appreciating ourselves,
appreciating our community and in Capri,

1612
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,960
Shane,
our greater community and you have to

1613
01:05:25,961 --> 01:05:28,360
reenter,
you have to reenter fi day.

1614
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:31,960
You have to be a part of whatever
gentrification happens to make sure that

1615
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:35,410
your stake is still there and net what
you care about from a moral and civil

1616
01:05:35,411 --> 01:05:37,630
perspective represented there.
My uncle,

1617
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:42,040
my uncle John Blackman,
who was a huge influence on me dad and

1618
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:46,810
had a five car garage where,
where he did transmissions and stuff and

1619
01:05:46,811 --> 01:05:49,210
I begged my aunt to sell it,
please,

1620
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:51,180
I don't want you.
I know they're going to come.

1621
01:05:51,181 --> 01:05:52,270
The beltline's coming.
I was cooked,

1622
01:05:52,271 --> 01:05:55,300
but please sell it to me.
I didn't want my uncle's building,

1623
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:58,480
you know,
for to go to strangers and become,

1624
01:05:58,481 --> 01:06:00,250
you know,
an apartment complex or something.

1625
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:02,770
And I walked in your building I senior
building and I said,

1626
01:06:02,771 --> 01:06:04,570
wow,
I know what I'm gonna do with it now.

1627
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:06,640
I've had it for like three years now.
It's just,

1628
01:06:06,641 --> 01:06:08,680
I just had it,
but I didn't never knew what I wanted to

1629
01:06:08,681 --> 01:06:08,830
do.

1630
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:09,611
But you were like,
Yo,

1631
01:06:09,611 --> 01:06:11,740
you need somewhere to go every day
you're building is impressive.

1632
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:12,341
I'm like,
Yo,

1633
01:06:12,341 --> 01:06:14,320
I'm just going to just make my bit,
my uncle's building.

1634
01:06:14,321 --> 01:06:16,570
My office is right.
And I figured out a way to make a lot of

1635
01:06:16,571 --> 01:06:17,560
money off of it.
I mean,

1636
01:06:17,561 --> 01:06:20,260
I've already made a lot of money,
which is what leaving me to buy it.

1637
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:24,370
But it's important to me that as his
neighborhood turns into hipster land,

1638
01:06:24,371 --> 01:06:26,290
because it's definitely going to be,
she's going to be black hips going to be

1639
01:06:26,291 --> 01:06:27,430
like chocolate,
hipster and land.

1640
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:30,430
I just wanted to make sure that's,
there's still some chocolate working

1641
01:06:30,431 --> 01:06:33,550
class in there and sometimes they're
going to go buy coffee and there's going

1642
01:06:33,551 --> 01:06:37,810
to be a loud ass muscle car and lots of
marijuana smoke point out of it so

1643
01:06:37,811 --> 01:06:40,330
they'll know that you know,
my uncle's nephew still in town.

1644
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:42,880
Well,
you've got a,

1645
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:47,620
a great combination of a work ethic,
a sense of community,

1646
01:06:47,621 --> 01:06:51,250
and you had a business perspective.
I don't have a business perspective.

1647
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,130
I'm doing shit.
My wife,

1648
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:55,680
my wife,
your wife is doing it all while she

1649
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:57,670
taught Campbell.
You seem to know what the fuck you're

1650
01:06:57,671 --> 01:07:00,550
talking about.
If you've got a pretty good roadmap,

1651
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,880
Eh,
you know I've zero that zero business

1652
01:07:03,881 --> 01:07:07,030
perspective,
you have the discipline to go to the gym

1653
01:07:07,031 --> 01:07:08,470
every day though.
I do have that.

1654
01:07:08,471 --> 01:07:11,120
That's what I got it.
But I'm crazy that I'm going to the gym

1655
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:16,140
to try to silence demons forever.
I had man failing was the best thing

1656
01:07:17,321 --> 01:07:20,410
that ever happened to me for.
I think for everybody fail.

1657
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:23,680
Not because some people get stuck at
they failure and they become bitter and

1658
01:07:23,681 --> 01:07:25,690
they become envious.
They become hateful.

1659
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,760
At least how to mock.
Yeah.

1660
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:33,210
But failure can be one of the best
things that ever happened to failing and

1661
01:07:33,491 --> 01:07:35,680
having to learn to become a business
person.

1662
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,620
I'm very thankful for removed from the
failure.

1663
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:40,840
Now don't you think dad about your rap
career as well?

1664
01:07:40,841 --> 01:07:42,460
Like that's what I was talking.
Oh,

1665
01:07:42,461 --> 01:07:47,200
from business perspective as well.
From hailed at rat first I was a good

1666
01:07:47,201 --> 01:07:50,720
rapper,
but outcast tacoma and I records math.

1667
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:54,790
My first record that went gold at a time
where we read other record was going 10

1668
01:07:54,790 --> 01:07:55,810
million.
It was a fee.

1669
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:56,860
It didn't work.
Right.

1670
01:07:56,890 --> 01:08:00,370
It didn't work for me.
So I had to go to Texas and people like

1671
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:04,360
chameleon,
Aaron Paul Wall Bunbee zero,

1672
01:08:04,361 --> 01:08:05,860
slim thug,
trey to truth,

1673
01:08:05,861 --> 01:08:06,694
right?
Um,

1674
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:10,450
people like flip and hump.
These people taught me how to press up

1675
01:08:10,451 --> 01:08:13,030
my own cds,
put them in the marketplace,

1676
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:15,350
sell them at profit,
reinvest themselves.

1677
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:18,200
They taught me that and selling drugs.

1678
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:21,070
You know what,
they taught me to rudimentary

1679
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:23,420
fundamentals of business and when I met
my wife,

1680
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:24,950
I can remember dating two,
three,

1681
01:08:24,951 --> 01:08:27,560
four,
five little hot chicks and her just

1682
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:29,150
mentally being,
you know,

1683
01:08:29,151 --> 01:08:30,080
our wife caught her,
right?

1684
01:08:30,081 --> 01:08:31,160
Right.
Freshman Year of college.

1685
01:08:31,161 --> 01:08:35,000
But just mentally she was light years
ahead of everyone because the

1686
01:08:35,001 --> 01:08:38,600
grandmother had raised her in that way.
Grandmother had a shot house running

1687
01:08:38,601 --> 01:08:42,740
around or like a Chitlin circuit you
want go get a shot for $2 on Sundays

1688
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:44,120
because the south is,
you know,

1689
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:46,680
it's a weird place.
We didn't use to sell alcohol on Sunday.

1690
01:08:46,681 --> 01:08:50,090
So my wife I recognize,
have a sharper mind and me for business.

1691
01:08:50,091 --> 01:08:53,660
What I had was good ideas for what was
sale and what would be well in the

1692
01:08:53,661 --> 01:08:56,370
marketplace and what she had was a
discipline to Oregon.

1693
01:08:56,390 --> 01:08:59,210
Have any failures in your business
practice or the jam.

1694
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:01,950
And first few years I had a barbershop I
wanted to kill every Barbara.

1695
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:05,630
Barbara's are like independent rappers.
You know,

1696
01:09:05,631 --> 01:09:09,630
everyone wants to be more famous than
they need to be an artist.

1697
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:11,300
Barbara's going to be famous.
Yeah.

1698
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:13,880
Partner's life via famous.
I mean there are local fixers.

1699
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:14,723
Yeah.
The artists.

1700
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,580
Absolutely.
And they should be,

1701
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,110
you know what I mean?
But um,

1702
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:19,221
with the essay,
it,

1703
01:09:19,221 --> 01:09:20,360
man,
it can be frustrating.

1704
01:09:20,361 --> 01:09:21,740
You know,
when Barbara comes in one day,

1705
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:23,510
like I want to wear a glitter Cape
today.

1706
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:25,310
The next part was coming of like,
yeah,

1707
01:09:25,311 --> 01:09:26,810
I want,
if I want to cut hair in the nude,

1708
01:09:26,811 --> 01:09:28,790
I want to use your shop to do it.
And you're like,

1709
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:29,624
Bro,
it doesn't,

1710
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:31,050
it doesn't work like that.
Like,

1711
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:35,750
like this is the right.
But I had to learn for us that the booth

1712
01:09:35,751 --> 01:09:38,090
rent model,
like you pay in booth renting us not

1713
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:39,890
making any more profit that they're
knit.

1714
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:41,120
So we had to kind of say,
well,

1715
01:09:41,121 --> 01:09:43,130
what is supercuts do?
What does great clips do?

1716
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:44,150
What?
Oh,

1717
01:09:44,151 --> 01:09:46,100
you want it by commission and then you
split.

1718
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:47,960
That means they have to beat her and her
weight.

1719
01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:52,640
And that's how we kinda learned business
when we got an offer from the hawks to

1720
01:09:52,641 --> 01:09:56,060
put our place in the space of the arena.
And we want to be a more arenas.

1721
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:58,280
We started to understand,
okay,

1722
01:09:58,281 --> 01:10:01,260
this is how you do business business.
You know,

1723
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:03,280
this is not just how you,
you know,

1724
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:06,650
make two to $4,000 extra a month and
that's just some good income for your

1725
01:10:06,651 --> 01:10:09,440
wife to be able to enjoy it.
But this is how you start to say,

1726
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,520
you know,
more than the bright a barbershop.

1727
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:14,780
This is a lifestyle and retail brand and
we happened to Barbara.

1728
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,870
But if you're a guy,
I don't like going to the beauty shops

1729
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:22,900
or beauty stores to buy my brushes or by
my combs or you know,

1730
01:10:23,211 --> 01:10:25,090
if you want to get a little gray out of
your beard,

1731
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:27,380
you know,
you don't want to be in the rx section

1732
01:10:27,381 --> 01:10:29,600
of your local walmart or you're was
like,

1733
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:31,160
hey,
where do I get the grade from my beer

1734
01:10:31,161 --> 01:10:32,540
cause I want to go get hot young chicks.

1735
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:34,430
You know,
you want to go shop.

1736
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:36,380
And so we develop products,
we have cool stuff.

1737
01:10:36,381 --> 01:10:39,620
You can just buy it right there.
And we've learning to be business people

1738
01:10:39,621 --> 01:10:42,270
and hopefully I would like to become the
chick filet of barbershops.

1739
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:45,890
I'd like for people to want to want to
have us in their towns and pay us a lot

1740
01:10:45,891 --> 01:10:48,240
of money to come.
Well it's a man's hangout too.

1741
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:51,230
I mean,
you can say anything you want and no one

1742
01:10:51,231 --> 01:10:52,220
judges,
you can tall,

1743
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:54,790
you can watch the Joe Rogan Talk Shit,
you know?

1744
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,680
Yeah.
Barbershops are uniquely masculine.

1745
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:59,720
They are like beauty shops are for
girls.

1746
01:10:59,721 --> 01:11:01,910
Girls can go into a beauty shop and get
their nails done and no,

1747
01:11:01,911 --> 01:11:04,760
there's not going to be any men there.
They can talk all kinds of crazy shit.

1748
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:06,200
Yeah.
That's one of the reasons why they like

1749
01:11:06,201 --> 01:11:06,680
it.
Yep.

1750
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,180
And,
and the women that do come to

1751
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:10,250
barbershops are some of the best shit
talkers.

1752
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:12,740
So even they fit in,
right?

1753
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:14,100
Yeah.
That's

1754
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:14,700
what,
you know,

1755
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:19,320
barbershop is exciting as one that has
those two or three women customers data,

1756
01:11:19,321 --> 01:11:20,730
just prime shit.
Talkers.

1757
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:22,200
How much,
if any,

1758
01:11:22,201 --> 01:11:25,290
are you paying attention to things like
crypto currencies?

1759
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:28,230
Um,
Dj Vlad has taught me a lot about

1760
01:11:28,231 --> 01:11:30,930
stocks.
So much to the point that I bought my

1761
01:11:30,931 --> 01:11:33,240
wife thousands of dollars in stocks for
Christmas.

1762
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:35,280
She cried,
she cried when I,

1763
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:37,140
when I showed it a wedding band that I
bought,

1764
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:39,510
cause I never really got her winning
band and say,

1765
01:11:39,511 --> 01:11:42,360
I really want to show you.
I'm dedicating myself to you.

1766
01:11:42,361 --> 01:11:45,500
And this is,
this is never coming off at if Soviet,

1767
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:47,850
beginning of Christmas,
she cried when she saw my wedding band.

1768
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,120
And at the end she cried when I say,
I never want you to be fully dependent

1769
01:11:51,121 --> 01:11:54,240
upon me or feel that way.
So here's a lot of stock.

1770
01:11:54,241 --> 01:11:55,260
And she cried like a baby.

1771
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:57,950
I called flat like this shit works.
Bronco Friesen,

1772
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:01,980
Bro.
But I'm so I'm learning about,

1773
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:05,640
and I just put lots of money into the s
and p 500,

1774
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:07,950
but I don't know a lot about crypto
currency and stuff.

1775
01:12:07,951 --> 01:12:10,710
I'm learning how to have money.
I'm fascinated by them.

1776
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:13,620
Uh,
d the idea of a decentralized economy,

1777
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:14,910
you know,
cause we're always,

1778
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:19,280
the whole thing has always been about
the,

1779
01:12:19,281 --> 01:12:24,180
the amount of money that banks control.
If you just stop and think about what's

1780
01:12:24,181 --> 01:12:27,870
going,
what goes on with the Federal Reserve

1781
01:12:27,871 --> 01:12:31,690
and what goes on with all the money and
how much a dollar is worth overseas and

1782
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:34,170
balance of it all.
If there was something that we can all

1783
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:38,610
rely on that wasn't controlled by any
gigantic group of people that have a

1784
01:12:38,611 --> 01:12:41,820
vested interest in profiting off of this
pile of money.

1785
01:12:41,821 --> 01:12:44,640
If it was some sort of a bitcoin like
thing,

1786
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:46,920
it'd be a really different world.

1787
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:47,881
Yeah.
Really,

1788
01:12:47,881 --> 01:12:49,050
really different.
Eh,

1789
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:50,400
it,
it would,

1790
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,820
it would,
it'd be different if the world was money

1791
01:12:52,821 --> 01:12:54,600
list.
It'd be different if there was a gold

1792
01:12:54,601 --> 01:12:55,530
standard.
Again,

1793
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:58,290
it'd be a lot of differences.
But the question becomes,

1794
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:02,280
is the banking mafia of source ever
going to let that happen?

1795
01:13:02,281 --> 01:13:03,960
And what happened?
How could they stop it?

1796
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:06,810
Well,
it's like stopping the Internet at this

1797
01:13:06,811 --> 01:13:07,950
point.
So you think it's calming,

1798
01:13:07,951 --> 01:13:09,420
you think we're going to get the
cryptocurrency?

1799
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:12,540
I think it's eventually going to be,
what are we going to throw the chicken

1800
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:13,393
coops?
It's kind of,

1801
01:13:13,670 --> 01:13:14,211
they're going to,
yeah,

1802
01:13:14,211 --> 01:13:16,530
let's be big.
That's a question correctly,

1803
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,180
right?
You can't throw coins and clubs.

1804
01:13:18,181 --> 01:13:19,200
It's true.
Yeah.

1805
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,430
What can you,
yeah,

1806
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:21,930
we,
yeah.

1807
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:26,960
Pieces of paper that tells you how
change on your way and cash and no ass

1808
01:13:27,601 --> 01:13:30,900
bro.
Bitcoin will become like dollar bills

1809
01:13:30,901 --> 01:13:34,310
that'll represent bitcoin mccarthy black
tower built with a goal,

1810
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:39,410
like a shiny gold lettering to make a
shit ton of money.

1811
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:41,690
We'd be going,
no,

1812
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:42,990
no,
some,

1813
01:13:42,991 --> 01:13:46,110
we made some of it for her fight for the
forgotten charity.

1814
01:13:46,111 --> 01:13:48,870
They build wells for the pygmies in the
Congo.

1815
01:13:48,871 --> 01:13:51,480
My friend Justin wren,
he lives in the Congo for six months out

1816
01:13:51,481 --> 01:13:54,460
of the year building wells.
And so fight for the forgotten we,

1817
01:13:54,461 --> 01:13:57,330
we raised,
we raised a bunch of money through this

1818
01:13:57,331 --> 01:13:59,120
thing called the cash app.
Every time someone,

1819
01:13:59,121 --> 01:14:01,410
someone's actually $5 goes to fight for
the forgotten.

1820
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,750
Gotcha.
And we got some big coin that we raised

1821
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:07,140
that went to them too.
So wells got built because of that.

1822
01:14:07,141 --> 01:14:08,340
He's built.
I don't know how many,

1823
01:14:08,341 --> 01:14:12,130
well these are like 18 wells they built
for the pygmies and they're constantly

1824
01:14:12,131 --> 01:14:14,350
building new ones because the big
museum.

1825
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:15,490
Freshwater.
Yeah.

1826
01:14:15,491 --> 01:14:17,630
He's a fighter.
He fights for Bell Tory.

1827
01:14:17,631 --> 01:14:19,180
He's one of their top heavyweights stove
shit.

1828
01:14:19,230 --> 01:14:21,760
And uh,
goes over to Africa and lives in the

1829
01:14:21,761 --> 01:14:24,400
Congo with the pygmies ass fucking,
yeah man.

1830
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,450
He lives there in the village for,
you know,

1831
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:28,810
months.
He's gotten malaria three times.

1832
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:31,840
Almost died from it.
Yes.

1833
01:14:31,841 --> 01:14:34,300
The dedication.
He's one of the nicest people that's

1834
01:14:34,301 --> 01:14:36,140
ever walked the face of the planet.
That's fucking nuts.

1835
01:14:36,141 --> 01:14:39,310
So did he do to malaria shaft and shit
and it's still catchman area.

1836
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:42,010
I do not do a first trip to Africa next
year.

1837
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:43,440
So,
you know,

1838
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,820
as a black guy,
I feel it's important or y'all want to

1839
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:47,800
catch malaria?
That's him back there.

1840
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:48,940
Wow.
Yeah.

1841
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:50,150
They call them the big pig.
Me.

1842
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:52,150
That's amazing.
Yeah.

1843
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:55,650
Nicest guy that's ever lived.
Those are,

1844
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:56,870
wow.
Yeah.

1845
01:14:56,871 --> 01:14:59,050
I mean the guy goes there for six months
a year.

1846
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:03,430
It's amazing people in the picture with
them look like they were related to me.

1847
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:06,671
Yeah.
It's pretty cool,

1848
01:15:06,671 --> 01:15:08,500
man.
He's got some great videos on fight for

1849
01:15:08,501 --> 01:15:09,760
the forgotten.
That's beautiful.

1850
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:10,990
Uh,
where you could see the,

1851
01:15:10,991 --> 01:15:13,330
um,
the wells being built and the water

1852
01:15:13,331 --> 01:15:14,620
coming out.
I got to check that out.

1853
01:15:14,621 --> 01:15:15,850
You can send me the link.
Yeah,

1854
01:15:15,851 --> 01:15:17,290
for sure.
Dope for sure.

1855
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,150
Um,
what were we talking about?

1856
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:24,180
How do we get up to this
corporate donors we raised,

1857
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:27,040
we raised some money for him through a
bitcoin as well,

1858
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:28,530
but I think that it's,
um,

1859
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:30,550
give me some advice.
I don't know enough about it.

1860
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:32,920
I'm an idiot.
I just thought anything on anything

1861
01:15:32,921 --> 01:15:34,630
money related.
Cause you have an icon jeep,

1862
01:15:34,631 --> 01:15:39,180
so I know you have more money.
I just work a lot that just,

1863
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,650
you know what,
we'll such grandfatherly that's true.

1864
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:42,870
That's the shit.
My grandfather,

1865
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:44,980
I'm not a big,
I'm not a big investor.

1866
01:15:44,981 --> 01:15:45,820
I'm not very smart.

1867
01:15:45,910 --> 01:15:48,550
I got you.
I have people handling that kind of

1868
01:15:48,551 --> 01:15:49,031
stuff,
which,

1869
01:15:49,031 --> 01:15:49,691
you know,
work a lot,

1870
01:15:49,691 --> 01:15:52,400
but I don't pay attention to anything.
I paid attention.

1871
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:53,470
Guilty now.
Yeah.

1872
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:57,970
I do too many things myself to the place
where I know exactly what I have to pay

1873
01:15:57,971 --> 01:15:58,930
attention to them.
What I don't,

1874
01:15:59,150 --> 01:16:01,430
I don't have to pay attention to is just
gone shot.

1875
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:03,820
Robert Paul laid my accountant has made
it pretty easy for me.

1876
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:06,760
He is literally a graph.
This is a dollar you make.

1877
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:09,970
This is what goes into savings.
This is what goes into investment.

1878
01:16:09,971 --> 01:16:12,100
This is what you and Shay weren't
invested in real estate.

1879
01:16:12,370 --> 01:16:15,250
This is for retirement.
So now everything that comes in and I

1880
01:16:15,251 --> 01:16:17,740
already know.
So it's like when they call us until

1881
01:16:17,741 --> 01:16:18,640
like,
hey you guys,

1882
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:22,150
you guys got a $500,000 a day.
I just know that I'm not going home with

1883
01:16:22,151 --> 01:16:24,320
two 50 because asset management
conditions,

1884
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:26,470
my wife and my accounting already chop
that shit up.

1885
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:30,190
So I'm just like,
I got enough money to buy a Camaro.

1886
01:16:30,590 --> 01:16:34,030
Yeah,
I don't like to think about that.

1887
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:38,780
I had just to think about now,
because you know I'm black and you know,

1888
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,270
shit,
I ain't been too good if you like,

1889
01:16:40,271 --> 01:16:41,890
but he got money.
If you pour a black,

1890
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:44,000
if you pour America's fucked up,
yeah,

1891
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:46,780
if you pour and black Americans fuck
that with a deal during ass.

1892
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:48,340
So you know,
my whole shit is,

1893
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:50,440
let,
let me take care of my money because my

1894
01:16:50,441 --> 01:16:51,010
Grandpa,
you know,

1895
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:53,590
my grandmother,
her family owned land,

1896
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:56,980
they started as sharecroppers but
because they all land she could,

1897
01:16:56,981 --> 01:16:59,680
because she could become educated
because they could sell the stuff.

1898
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:02,140
They grew to stores and produce markets
and stuff.

1899
01:17:02,141 --> 01:17:04,750
So she named were methodist.
So she got to go to school.

1900
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:08,200
My grandfather,
some mother old no land.

1901
01:17:08,810 --> 01:17:10,160
So grandfather had

1902
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,980
to work in a bread factory in cotton
meals and shit.

1903
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:17,900
So I knew did difference between
ownership and you know,

1904
01:17:17,901 --> 01:17:19,820
the advantages of having something in
it.

1905
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:24,350
So it's something I can have obsessed on
because I don't want my children to

1906
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:27,050
endure poverty.
And I,

1907
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:28,340
and I grew up working class,
you know,

1908
01:17:28,341 --> 01:17:30,260
my wife,
she jokes but she says it a lot.

1909
01:17:30,261 --> 01:17:32,090
You know,
she was from housing projects in

1910
01:17:32,091 --> 01:17:34,400
Savannah and her grandmother and her
mother worked.

1911
01:17:34,401 --> 01:17:35,720
They were out of there.
But you know,

1912
01:17:35,721 --> 01:17:37,130
she says to me,
me all the time,

1913
01:17:37,131 --> 01:17:38,420
you were spoiled.
You know,

1914
01:17:38,421 --> 01:17:39,320
you're a little rich.
Kids were like,

1915
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:40,071
what are you talking about?
She's like,

1916
01:17:40,071 --> 01:17:41,390
you had a fucking rv.
I'm like,

1917
01:17:41,391 --> 01:17:43,730
I lived in an a frame house.
She's like,

1918
01:17:43,731 --> 01:17:45,020
I don't care.
Your Grandpa,

1919
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:46,370
your grandparents couldn't afford the
RV.

1920
01:17:46,371 --> 01:17:48,190
You guys went on vacation.
You were spoiled.

1921
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:53,690
So I understand money means a lot and it
doesn't mean everything to me,

1922
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,360
but it helps to afford me to be able to
take care of her,

1923
01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:58,670
my children.
I completely understand it,

1924
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:01,730
but I don't really give a shit knock on
a daily basis.

1925
01:18:01,731 --> 01:18:04,820
I'm more like you do.
But you think about businesses,

1926
01:18:04,821 --> 01:18:06,980
you think about starting businesses and
forming businesses.

1927
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:10,550
How do you have the time to do that and
write and perform and all the other shit

1928
01:18:10,551 --> 01:18:13,460
that you do?
Because it enabled what the business has

1929
01:18:13,461 --> 01:18:15,380
enabled me to enjoy writing and
performing.

1930
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:17,630
When I had to wrap,
when there was no choice,

1931
01:18:18,350 --> 01:18:19,220
um,
it,

1932
01:18:19,290 --> 01:18:22,820
it wasn't as fun anymore because the
pressure was,

1933
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:25,250
am I going to chart,
can I make this much?

1934
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:27,890
Will the record versus,
you know,

1935
01:18:27,891 --> 01:18:30,080
if I have a couple of streams of revenue
coming in,

1936
01:18:30,110 --> 01:18:33,650
you know,
it makes it a little more relaxed and my

1937
01:18:33,651 --> 01:18:35,470
art is freer that way,
you know?

1938
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:37,490
Ooh,
I like that answer.

1939
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:40,070
That's a great answer.
That makes sense.

1940
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:42,140
That makes a lot of sense actually.
Yeah.

1941
01:18:42,141 --> 01:18:45,050
To free yourself up creatively so that
all you have to think about when you're

1942
01:18:45,051 --> 01:18:46,970
doing that,
you're just doing what you want to do.

1943
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:47,863
Yeah,
that's it.

1944
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:48,823
Yeah,
that's it.

1945
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:50,240
Yeah man.
That's ideal.

1946
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:52,250
That's wise.
That's the goal.

1947
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:53,690
Yeah.
If I'm a,

1948
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:55,400
you know,
a lot of people talk a lot of shit about

1949
01:18:55,401 --> 01:18:57,650
billionaires they like and they want to
be,

1950
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,080
and then daryl,
there are tons of billionaires from the

1951
01:19:00,081 --> 01:19:02,930
nerdy sexy or Bill Gates or the wild
dope,

1952
01:19:02,931 --> 01:19:06,650
eccentric,
sexy of Eli Musk to the ogs of Warren

1953
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:08,300
Buffett and shit.
I like Ted Turner,

1954
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:12,020
Ted Turner as well.
Ted was the guy who got nine and got

1955
01:19:12,021 --> 01:19:14,660
snookered out of six,
ended up with one or two and it's like,

1956
01:19:14,661 --> 01:19:15,890
man,
I'm living in my fucking life.

1957
01:19:15,891 --> 01:19:17,410
Growing Bison eaten good meat.

1958
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:20,300
Where the fuck the cowboy hat when my
funky mustache,

1959
01:19:21,130 --> 01:19:24,530
he's,
he was such a good owner of teams and

1960
01:19:24,531 --> 01:19:25,670
our city,
when he owned the teams,

1961
01:19:25,671 --> 01:19:28,400
he was a great man with tbs and he did a
lot of good.

1962
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:29,393
He's,
if,

1963
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:30,440
if,
if,

1964
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,660
if a billion is the new style,
I want to be a billionaire,

1965
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:34,550
but of having a lot of money's a
standard,

1966
01:19:34,551 --> 01:19:37,430
I'd like to be the quirky eccentric guy.
Like Ted,

1967
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:40,670
he always seemed free to me.
Yeah.

1968
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,710
Especially once he got rid of Jane
Fonda.

1969
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:47,850
Ava shouts out to this and when he
married Jane Fonda the south where we

1970
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:50,200
literally thought it was,
we all made,

1971
01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:53,060
it was like the city of Atlanta had went
back to gone with the wind.

1972
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:54,830
It was just amazing.
Again,

1973
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:57,140
it was,
people were strutting around that,

1974
01:19:57,141 --> 01:19:58,400
you know,
Jane Fonda's virtual,

1975
01:19:58,410 --> 01:20:00,020
our first lady,
you know,

1976
01:20:00,021 --> 01:20:02,600
if he will start to,
but I choose a nice lady to the city.

1977
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,720
David Justice and highly barry were
interesting to

1978
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:08,000
not interested

1979
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,460
in is 10 some bastard.
He was handsome.

1980
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:11,760
One motherfucker world.
Was it?

1981
01:20:11,761 --> 01:20:12,361
What's the,
um,

1982
01:20:12,361 --> 01:20:14,330
what's the yachting if anyone,
I don't know.

1983
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:17,190
The Yada he who's,
he got into the yachting Outta Nowhere

1984
01:20:17,191 --> 01:20:19,320
Cause Cup America.
That was the America's Cup was it?

1985
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:21,023
Was that right?
Yeah.

1986
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:24,810
Ted Turner lived a life that Ralph
Lauren puts on tee shirts.

1987
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:28,950
Yeah,
he looks like a,

1988
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:32,610
like a billionaire and a movie too.
He does great gatsby type.

1989
01:20:32,611 --> 01:20:35,190
He does.
He does some guy who is a wise

1990
01:20:35,191 --> 01:20:37,020
billionaire.
It brings you into this study and you

1991
01:20:37,021 --> 01:20:38,820
have a scotch with him on ice.
Exactly.

1992
01:20:38,821 --> 01:20:42,630
Explain Shit to you and you're like,
what in the fuck shouts out to tay it

1993
01:20:42,631 --> 01:20:44,330
man.
I know you don't get your love like a

1994
01:20:44,331 --> 01:20:48,170
lot of the other guys who love the cut.
He does the fucking my tannic ground

1995
01:20:48,171 --> 01:20:50,100
bison,
he's out there chilling man.

1996
01:20:50,101 --> 01:20:50,880
We bound it.

1997
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:54,390
The population of Bison so he could cook
them and eat them.

1998
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:57,330
It's like get the fuck outta here.
That's bad ass man.

1999
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:59,910
Look at those overalls.
Respect.

2000
01:20:59,911 --> 01:21:02,760
That's how my fucking grandfather
dressed with the same mustache.

2001
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:07,000
That's what I want to be like when I
think about making 21 million and

2002
01:21:07,001 --> 01:21:10,770
escaping the game and shit.
This is me like maybe overalls and a

2003
01:21:10,771 --> 01:21:12,120
braves cap,
but this is it.

2004
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:16,050
Now let me ask you this,
how far away from him or dudes with

2005
01:21:16,051 --> 01:21:19,740
machine guns at all times,
but he's in fucking Montana,

2006
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:22,510
but so what?
I can drive to my tenants to kill Ted

2007
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:23,450
Turner.
Who wants to come in?

2008
01:21:23,451 --> 01:21:25,770
No one wants to kill Ted Turner.
He kept somebody,

2009
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:26,790
Bro.
No one wants to kill.

2010
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:29,520
I would imagine he has two snipers.
He probably has a,

2011
01:21:29,521 --> 01:21:31,320
yeah,
he probably has two snipers

2012
01:21:32,820 --> 01:21:35,790
say east and west and he has one guy
within a few feet of him,

2013
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:37,050
but very relaxed.

2014
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:38,980
I don't think teds walking around like
Qaddafi.

2015
01:21:39,190 --> 01:21:41,880
Did you think you get to assert didn't
work out well for Khadafi know and do

2016
01:21:41,881 --> 01:21:43,890
more kind of long for him.
He was hanging around with the wrong

2017
01:21:43,891 --> 01:21:44,880
dude's.
Damn.

2018
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:50,640
The last video of Kadafi dead is one of
the most disturbing videos and all of

2019
01:21:50,641 --> 01:21:54,690
human history to see him realize that
they got his over and then that guy

2020
01:21:54,691 --> 01:21:58,330
strip shops at knife up his ass and he's
barely even reacting to him.

2021
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,630
He's just,
he's in a state of shock.

2022
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:03,090
If you have understand people who have
not of a certain age man,

2023
01:22:03,091 --> 01:22:04,680
these were the villains when we were
young man,

2024
01:22:04,710 --> 01:22:08,230
Gorbachev Kadafi cashed all like when
you start dating,

2025
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:09,660
and I'm not saying I agree or don't
agree,

2026
01:22:09,661 --> 01:22:13,140
I'm just saying they were gave get to
give it to us as doug villains.

2027
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:17,490
I never thought if he could go out and
the way you went out bad,

2028
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:21,300
we saw a couple guys go out like that,
but that was the craziest one because

2029
01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:24,900
that was him getting caught by rebels
executing him on the spot.

2030
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:27,450
They didn't even wait.
They didn't even wait until like,

2031
01:22:27,451 --> 01:22:29,070
fuck this.
Fuck this trial.

2032
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:31,740
I'm going to kill this guy right now.
They threw his body on the hood of the

2033
01:22:31,741 --> 01:22:34,020
car.
Driving around with a fucking deer.

2034
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,190
Yeah,
like a fucking deer.

2035
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:36,370
Exactly.
Then

2036
01:22:37,970 --> 01:22:40,740
I had researched and beat the shit out
of him.

2037
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:42,290
It is,
it's a horrible,

2038
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:45,210
and his dad job is showing,
you can see it's gray hairs.

2039
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:50,320
Ah,
y'all said a little bit and then temple.

2040
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,550
Yeah,
that's a well but Ted Turner's the

2041
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:54,473
billionaire.
I want to be,

2042
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,910
if I could pick one of the most
disturbing videos,

2043
01:22:57,060 --> 01:23:00,730
was Hillary Clinton laughing about him
dying over?

2044
01:23:00,990 --> 01:23:02,620
You see that video?
No Bro.

2045
01:23:02,710 --> 01:23:05,410
She's doing an interview and she,
they're talking about Kadafi and she

2046
01:23:05,411 --> 01:23:06,370
goes,
we came,

2047
01:23:06,371 --> 01:23:11,371
we saw he died
and she starts laughing cause I guess

2048
01:23:11,471 --> 01:23:12,140
they have genuine

2049
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:13,430
throngs worthy.
That's sir.

2050
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:17,080
It was a surgery as a queen
and we all want it.

2051
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:20,720
My friend called me this year.
Oh cassie Jaye swift.

2052
01:23:20,721 --> 01:23:22,610
My wife tells me I need a husband more
than,

2053
01:23:22,611 --> 01:23:24,350
than we,
the world needs a martyr that,

2054
01:23:24,830 --> 01:23:26,440
and my friend called me saying,
you know what man,

2055
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:29,390
really,
I just don't want nobody to kill my

2056
01:23:29,391 --> 01:23:31,520
friend.
That and that really made me push it in

2057
01:23:31,521 --> 01:23:34,740
perspective.
Like maybe I should keep saying it.

2058
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:38,990
A dance.
Maybe you shouldn't try to braveheart

2059
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:39,933
this thing.

2060
01:23:40,650 --> 01:23:42,510
Yeah,
people definitely still do.

2061
01:23:42,511 --> 01:23:43,370
Get shot.
Yeah.

2062
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:45,600
Straight up.
Fuck what anybody says.

2063
01:23:45,690 --> 01:23:47,420
Eh.
There was a dude who was an Enron

2064
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:50,850
whistleblower who?
Enron whistleblower who shot himself in

2065
01:23:50,851 --> 01:23:52,440
the head twice.
Yeah,

2066
01:23:52,470 --> 01:23:53,610
exactly.
Exactly.

2067
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:55,250
That kind of shit.
That doesn't,

2068
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:59,010
what in the fuck are you talking about?
Did you ever read the strange death of

2069
01:23:59,011 --> 01:24:00,360
Vince Foster?
I have not.

2070
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:01,770
It's a great book.
Okay.

2071
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:04,260
It's about Vince foster who was in
cahoots with the Clintons,

2072
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:05,880
shot himself.
They,

2073
01:24:05,881 --> 01:24:07,920
when they found his body,
the gun was still in his hand,

2074
01:24:07,921 --> 01:24:10,460
which never happens.
Guns fly out of here.

2075
01:24:10,461 --> 01:24:14,190
Then there was less blood at the scene
of the crime then was missing from his

2076
01:24:14,191 --> 01:24:16,920
body.
So the idea is that someone moved him.

2077
01:24:16,921 --> 01:24:18,470
Someone put him there.
Yeah,

2078
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:21,270
right down on his shit.
Fake Donovan Shit.

2079
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,660
They did it for sure they did it,
but before there was an internet.

2080
01:24:24,930 --> 01:24:26,820
Oh,
you to do is grease the right amount of

2081
01:24:26,821 --> 01:24:29,700
people and have a plan in place and it's
done.

2082
01:24:29,701 --> 01:24:30,370
It's done.
He

2083
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:32,980
did it forever.
They did it through the Roman era.

2084
01:24:32,981 --> 01:24:36,100
They did great.
They did it from the beginning of time.

2085
01:24:36,101 --> 01:24:39,440
People who've been whacking people this
era.

2086
01:24:39,970 --> 01:24:41,530
A lot of people act as though those
were,

2087
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:42,471
again,
like I said,

2088
01:24:42,471 --> 01:24:45,430
he's empires that were under having
thousands of years.

2089
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:48,570
Like a corporation will change his name,
you know,

2090
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:49,630
and,
and go forward.

2091
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:51,010
There's something else.
I honestly,

2092
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,990
I'm going to at some point get a,
what was it?

2093
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,470
What's her brother's name?
Romulus and I forget the other brother,

2094
01:24:56,471 --> 01:25:00,400
but who were circled by the wolves that
was like to start to fit the fairytale

2095
01:25:00,401 --> 01:25:02,780
started wrong.
I'm going to get that as a peer.

2096
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:04,110
As a pendant.
Ooh.

2097
01:25:04,450 --> 01:25:05,420
Yeah.
It's going to be some,

2098
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:08,140
I like artsy rap shit.
So I have like the winged victory of

2099
01:25:08,141 --> 01:25:10,450
some [inaudible] is my,
is um,

2100
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,530
is a piece,
have another piece that's based on it.

2101
01:25:12,590 --> 01:25:14,770
Get that.
I'm getting that on appendage Jesus,

2102
01:25:14,771 --> 01:25:17,010
yet it wasn't Romulus.
And what's the other brother's name is

2103
01:25:17,230 --> 01:25:18,640
Raymond [inaudible].
Raymond's and Robin and sell.

2104
01:25:18,641 --> 01:25:23,641
Apparently our society that we live in
under now was the legend is Jamie said,

2105
01:25:23,951 --> 01:25:28,930
well you see we started by two brothers
who were nursed after,

2106
01:25:28,931 --> 01:25:31,510
after bay being abandoned where nurse by
a wolf.

2107
01:25:32,010 --> 01:25:36,550
So Western society is built on that
concept and you're gonna ask me to give

2108
01:25:36,551 --> 01:25:39,310
up my fucking guns.
The Fuck Outta here.

2109
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,250
Fuck.
Gotta Yo man.

2110
01:25:43,690 --> 01:25:46,420
Wolf Tooth,
Wolf Scott chain mail around its neck

2111
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:48,850
exam.
I'm going to get that on a fucking

2112
01:25:48,851 --> 01:25:50,380
pendant.
It's going to be like this rapper.

2113
01:25:50,381 --> 01:25:53,410
Big Shit.
That's a war wolf thing.

2114
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,780
Look at that.
That's got to do vitals protected.

2115
01:25:56,620 --> 01:25:58,030
That's crazy.
Yeah,

2116
01:25:58,270 --> 01:26:00,010
that's what,
that's what we're sitting in the middle

2117
01:26:00,011 --> 01:26:04,110
of teas.
Every geist Erica babies from wolves.

2118
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:06,340
From wolves.
So what do you think the mentality of

2119
01:26:06,341 --> 01:26:08,630
people who run a us?
Jesus Christ.

2120
01:26:08,870 --> 01:26:10,320
I saw this,
I saw it in the loo.

2121
01:26:10,321 --> 01:26:12,680
Me and my wife was stoned as fuck.
That's incredible.

2122
01:26:12,681 --> 01:26:14,030
Walking through the loom and I was just
like,

2123
01:26:14,031 --> 01:26:17,720
this is amazing.
I stared at what a freaky looking wolf

2124
01:26:17,730 --> 01:26:21,080
too hungry and shit.
Looks like a fucking Hyena actually.

2125
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:21,861
Yeah,
it does.

2126
01:26:21,861 --> 01:26:26,861
It doesn't look like it's got wolf hair.
Cause waves are beautiful like that.

2127
01:26:26,891 --> 01:26:27,920
That's an,
that will faint.

2128
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:30,110
But it's weird to decide to make a bald
wolf.

2129
01:26:30,111 --> 01:26:31,170
That's a bald wall.
Yeah,

2130
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:32,320
it's like shaved.
Yeah.

2131
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:35,210
There's no hair on it anyway.
Doesn't show any hair.

2132
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:36,920
Who knows what the fuck wolves looked
like?

2133
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,660
[inaudible] that's a good point.
Yeah.

2134
01:26:38,970 --> 01:26:41,330
Shaved the hair into the rock.
Yeah,

2135
01:26:41,331 --> 01:26:43,190
that's true too.
Yeah.

2136
01:26:43,430 --> 01:26:46,430
It'd be hard to shave it,
but still what a freaky idea.

2137
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:48,650
Eh,
so that's what suckled off of wolves.

2138
01:26:49,090 --> 01:26:50,330
They think about it and that's,
that's,

2139
01:26:50,450 --> 01:26:53,090
that's the mentality.
And arrested out of the rep in the room.

2140
01:26:53,150 --> 01:26:54,550
Have you ever been,
have not been in the room with me.

2141
01:26:54,610 --> 01:26:56,150
I went a couple of years ago for the
first time.

2142
01:26:56,151 --> 01:26:57,620
It's amazing.
Really stunning.

2143
01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:00,200
Stunning antiquity.
Is that what they call it?

2144
01:27:01,070 --> 01:27:03,620
When you go to the Vatican man,
you walk around and you realize how much

2145
01:27:03,621 --> 01:27:07,820
these motherfuckers stole.
There is billions of dollars where the

2146
01:27:07,821 --> 01:27:09,770
art there and you're like,
where did you get this funny?

2147
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:16,880
You're not out there selling sneakers.
Fuck is candy and bibles and we're going

2148
01:27:17,251 --> 01:27:20,450
to take all of this art that she has.
It's crazy.

2149
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:21,950
It's crazy.
You know,

2150
01:27:21,951 --> 01:27:23,630
it's interesting.
You know when you see Roman guys with

2151
01:27:23,631 --> 01:27:25,880
little Dicks,
the little thing,

2152
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:29,420
they,
they big dicks were discussed like big

2153
01:27:29,421 --> 01:27:32,450
dicks.
Were there were two savage and not

2154
01:27:32,451 --> 01:27:34,970
civilized.
They had little dicks and these little

2155
01:27:34,971 --> 01:27:37,100
statues.
If you look at these beautiful,

2156
01:27:37,101 --> 01:27:39,620
perfect bodies,
I'll a little dicks and that was because

2157
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:42,680
they felt like big dicks were gross.
Oh Wow.

2158
01:27:42,770 --> 01:27:44,060
How crazy is that?
That's what the guy,

2159
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:46,480
at least the professor that was guiding
us to load zig,

2160
01:27:46,481 --> 01:27:47,660
dude,
you're in the wrong century.

2161
01:27:48,550 --> 01:27:49,660
Yeah.
You just,

2162
01:27:49,661 --> 01:27:51,710
you are almost there.
The thing is though,

2163
01:27:51,711 --> 01:27:53,360
they want something that doesn't exist.
Right?

2164
01:27:53,361 --> 01:27:55,570
Because a guy who's built like that,
it's going to have a hog on them.

2165
01:27:56,240 --> 01:28:00,200
You know
those guys,

2166
01:28:01,130 --> 01:28:03,440
those guys are bad.
They're fucking a diocese.

2167
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:05,750
Right?
That's beautiful.

2168
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:07,850
You see Anthony Joshua step into the
ring.

2169
01:28:07,851 --> 01:28:09,680
You go,
that guy's got to have a gigantic day.

2170
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:12,530
He has to look it up and he's a fucking
specimen.

2171
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:15,890
There's no way he has a burger.
With that said,

2172
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:18,230
if you look at bodybuilding,
yeah,

2173
01:28:18,231 --> 01:28:21,530
but that's a different animal there.
They're breaking their body's ability to

2174
01:28:21,531 --> 01:28:23,810
perform,
to stop testosterone.

2175
01:28:23,811 --> 01:28:25,430
They're nuts.
A shrinking fucked up.

2176
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:26,390
Yeah.
It looks bad.

2177
01:28:27,050 --> 01:28:30,050
I got a picture of Ronnie Coleman that I
send to my friends every now and then

2178
01:28:30,051 --> 01:28:32,480
just as like a wake up call.
I save it on my phone.

2179
01:28:32,690 --> 01:28:34,760
I sent it.
I just want you to know that this is how

2180
01:28:34,761 --> 01:28:37,850
big people can get,
so why while you're lifting weights,

2181
01:28:37,970 --> 01:28:41,150
just keep everything in perspective and
always know

2182
01:28:42,730 --> 01:28:44,450
possible.
One of them,

2183
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:46,520
Ronnie me show you the one that I got on
my phone,

2184
01:28:46,521 --> 01:28:47,900
Jamie,
he just had back surgery,

2185
01:28:47,901 --> 01:28:48,920
game prayers up to run.

2186
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:51,980
I heard there's a documentary about him
that's on Netflix.

2187
01:28:51,981 --> 01:28:54,890
I'll watch it.
It was just sad and not sad,

2188
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:57,170
but like you feel bad,
just like first of all,

2189
01:28:57,171 --> 01:28:59,090
it's amazing.
He had that type of discipline.

2190
01:28:59,330 --> 01:29:03,810
He was eating 10,000 calories a day.
He was training for one hour a day doing

2191
01:29:03,811 --> 01:29:05,370
full,
full training,

2192
01:29:05,371 --> 01:29:09,210
top to bottom because he was a cop at
the same time and he was just a bull

2193
01:29:09,211 --> 01:29:10,170
about it.
Here it is,

2194
01:29:10,171 --> 01:29:11,670
but with that said it.
Oh my God,

2195
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,950
there's that picture.
Yeah,

2196
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:15,270
that's not good.
I can't.

2197
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:17,670
That's insane.
That's insane.

2198
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:19,120
This one jet,
that's a CV.

2199
01:29:19,130 --> 01:29:20,910
You find that one?
It's insane.

2200
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:21,610
Yeah.
And,

2201
01:29:21,610 --> 01:29:22,680
and now,
and now,

2202
01:29:22,681 --> 01:29:23,850
here's his back.
Is,

2203
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:26,180
is savagely just betraying them.
Yeah.

2204
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:27,420
Well,
he,

2205
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:30,030
he apparently would lift so much weight,
you know,

2206
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:33,300
he's a much smaller now.
He would live so much weight and worked

2207
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:34,680
out so much harder than anybody.

2208
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:38,870
Wow.
What a look at his last.

2209
01:29:38,970 --> 01:29:42,420
I want to send this so people can get
the one that we're looking at,

2210
01:29:42,421 --> 01:29:45,330
cause it's so fucking forget cycle.
You see the picture of that bull.

2211
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:47,310
Exactly.
You a all time.

2212
01:29:47,990 --> 01:29:49,140
Yeah.
They have,

2213
01:29:49,141 --> 01:29:52,020
um,
something wrong with,

2214
01:29:52,021 --> 01:29:55,920
um,
what does that Myostatin and Myostatin

2215
01:29:55,921 --> 01:29:59,220
inhibitors,
Myostatin is something that apparently

2216
01:29:59,221 --> 01:30:01,590
it regulates the muscle growth.
And,

2217
01:30:01,591 --> 01:30:03,810
uh,
when these myostatin inhibitors,

2218
01:30:03,811 --> 01:30:07,140
when they do,
they either happen accidentally on dogs

2219
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,170
called whippets on.
Have you ever seen a window?

2220
01:30:09,171 --> 01:30:10,830
Whippet whippets get,
uh,

2221
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:12,410
they have,
uh,

2222
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:17,040
an anomaly that occurs pretty,
pretty rarely where they growed like

2223
01:30:17,041 --> 01:30:19,520
double the muscle.
They fucking look super jacked.

2224
01:30:19,521 --> 01:30:20,730
You know,
we've gotta look like trash it up.

2225
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:22,050
Yeah.
Pull up one of those,

2226
01:30:22,051 --> 01:30:23,130
uh,
uh,

2227
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:27,050
Myostatin whippets
okay.

2228
01:30:27,190 --> 01:30:28,030
So here's a,
here's,

2229
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:29,940
sure.
There's the Ronnie Coleman picture.

2230
01:30:29,941 --> 01:30:31,620
So everybody could see it.
That's the one we're looking at.

2231
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:36,570
Like what in the fuck Jesus.
Those pictures were as you're a fag.

2232
01:30:36,571 --> 01:30:38,790
I walked into a gym,
do more to dishearten knew that

2233
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:42,470
anything.
Exactly like what the fuck am I not

2234
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:44,010
getting?
I ass not happening.

2235
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:49,320
You would have to be on everything that
science has ever twice did to put that

2236
01:30:49,321 --> 01:30:52,440
kind of mass on mass and you have to
have perfect genetics.

2237
01:30:52,441 --> 01:30:55,170
You have to have everything.
You have to have a warm Jesus Christ.

2238
01:30:56,070 --> 01:31:01,070
See if you can find those whippets.
The myostatin whippet crazy looking.

2239
01:31:01,671 --> 01:31:04,440
It doesn't even look like a real dog.
It looks like someone Cgi,

2240
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:07,840
like someone's fucking with it.
I just made a real dog just,

2241
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:11,520
they just have a weird anomaly,
a genetic anomaly that makes them super

2242
01:31:11,610 --> 01:31:14,520
fucking jacked.
Like how does that work though?

2243
01:31:14,521 --> 01:31:15,500
In terms of like,
I'm not,

2244
01:31:15,501 --> 01:31:17,370
I come,
I like pit bulls like I like,

2245
01:31:17,730 --> 01:31:18,180
there it is.

2246
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:20,610
So that's really how we thought that was
fate.

2247
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:21,600
No,
that's real.

2248
01:31:21,601 --> 01:31:22,680
Wow.
It's real.

2249
01:31:22,681 --> 01:31:26,190
There's a bunch of them.
It happens in this community for some

2250
01:31:26,191 --> 01:31:28,500
reason.
I've read something about what it is

2251
01:31:28,501 --> 01:31:33,240
about breeding that somehow or another,
this gene is trait has is more common in

2252
01:31:33,241 --> 01:31:36,450
whippets than most other animals as
crazy.

2253
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:40,050
I'd like the traditional style pit bull
like Pete from little rascals,

2254
01:31:40,051 --> 01:31:40,884
right?
Yeah.

2255
01:31:41,350 --> 01:31:43,200
The,
the new pit Bul.

2256
01:31:43,201 --> 01:31:46,740
The ones that are lower if bulkier,
almost like the lowest as an English

2257
01:31:46,741 --> 01:31:50,580
bulldog or over muscle.
I always wonder how useful are they?

2258
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,440
Well,
if they get ahold of you,

2259
01:31:52,441 --> 01:31:53,900
you're fucked.
Damn sure.

2260
01:31:54,390 --> 01:31:57,310
Power is just insane.
The power that those things have is

2261
01:31:57,311 --> 01:31:59,010
insane,
but it's bad.

2262
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:00,010
It's really when

2263
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:02,830
you get an answer like this,
and I have a hard time breathing,

2264
01:32:02,831 --> 01:32:03,664
it's not good for,
yeah,

2265
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:06,070
it's supposed to have longer legs so it
can move.

2266
01:32:06,071 --> 01:32:08,890
Good pit bulls were bred for a couple
reasons.

2267
01:32:08,891 --> 01:32:13,530
They were bred for purposes of fighting
and purposes of bringing down bulldogs.

2268
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:14,980
You know,
they run alongside the bull,

2269
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:16,330
grab the,
grab the nose,

2270
01:32:16,331 --> 01:32:18,630
ring trop their wait flip essentially
football ball.

2271
01:32:18,770 --> 01:32:21,550
So I'm just thinking myself as we liked
the aesthetics of what they look like.

2272
01:32:21,551 --> 01:32:23,560
Like,
what are we really doing to these little

2273
01:32:23,561 --> 01:32:26,140
guys where they're fucking,
they're buffed to shit,

2274
01:32:26,141 --> 01:32:27,550
but they're shorter shit.
It's hard to get up,

2275
01:32:27,551 --> 01:32:29,620
prepare steps for them.
You know they have such amazing

2276
01:32:29,621 --> 01:32:32,120
qualities because the fact they're game
bread because the,

2277
01:32:32,121 --> 01:32:33,400
the,
the ones that are,

2278
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:37,210
that responded negatively to people that
would growl at people or show aggression

2279
01:32:37,211 --> 01:32:37,780
to people.

2280
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:40,600
They called them.
So the ones that are real game dogs,

2281
01:32:40,601 --> 01:32:44,740
let's a little 35 pound males.
Those are the best dogs on the planet

2282
01:32:44,741 --> 01:32:45,161
earth,
man.

2283
01:32:45,161 --> 01:32:47,320
I've been trying to convince shaffer
like they're so nice.

2284
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:49,533
I'm like,
I just,

2285
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:50,251
I'm like,
Shit,

2286
01:32:50,251 --> 01:32:52,690
I'm sorry.
I can't do like these other rappers and

2287
01:32:52,691 --> 01:32:55,270
get a fucking a girl dog and act like
that.

2288
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:57,100
You already make me hold your fucking
Paris.

2289
01:32:57,660 --> 01:33:00,790
I'm not
straight the fuck up.

2290
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:05,260
Like I buy these things your thousands
of fucking dollars.

2291
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:09,070
I shouldn't be having to call the
coordinate because you want to fucking

2292
01:33:09,071 --> 01:33:09,904
walk around,
you know,

2293
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:13,180
hold my purse.
I have to go to phoenix sky.

2294
01:33:13,210 --> 01:33:15,520
That's one of her favorite stories.
I'm wanting to phoenix sky.

2295
01:33:15,521 --> 01:33:17,470
Hold my fucking purse.
I'm like taller.

2296
01:33:17,530 --> 01:33:19,510
Hold versus up.
You're hilarious.

2297
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:22,210
Checkmate moved that girls put on her
gun is in there though.

2298
01:33:22,210 --> 01:33:25,510
So I feel a little manly,
but it's still a fucking Louis Vuitton

2299
01:33:25,511 --> 01:33:26,260
purse,
you know.

2300
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:28,540
But if I had,
if I had a pit,

2301
01:33:28,790 --> 01:33:29,590
yeah,
great,

2302
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:30,670
great,
great pit,

2303
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:31,570
then I'd be,
I,

2304
01:33:31,571 --> 01:33:32,560
you know,
I'm just like,

2305
01:33:32,561 --> 01:33:34,350
I can't get a girl dog.
I got to get a paypal.

2306
01:33:34,370 --> 01:33:37,210
You could get a little pit bull and
people won't even know it's a pitbull.

2307
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:38,230
Yeah.
And they're nice.

2308
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:41,140
I told her about,
my oldest daughter is 21 now Naya.

2309
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:42,640
And we had,
we had,

2310
01:33:42,641 --> 01:33:45,100
uh,
we had a pit named coca.

2311
01:33:45,330 --> 01:33:47,140
I,
if for some reason didn't not like

2312
01:33:47,141 --> 01:33:50,590
sleeping in her bed or laying down a
[inaudible],

2313
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:52,210
we would have to,
and this is when I'm working,

2314
01:33:52,211 --> 01:33:54,430
like I'm getting up,
going to work at the fucking advanced

2315
01:33:54,431 --> 01:33:57,220
auto parts.
Her mom is in school and beauty school.

2316
01:33:57,221 --> 01:33:58,690
It's like we're tired.
We're young,

2317
01:33:58,691 --> 01:33:59,770
too young to have baby.

2318
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:03,070
We're beat the fuck up a night.
Would only sleep in her little rocker.

2319
01:34:04,780 --> 01:34:08,560
This dog was sleep directly under her.
And if you are not mere her mother,

2320
01:34:08,561 --> 01:34:11,050
you were not walking up there touching
this child.

2321
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,630
Well and when my daughter was awake,
she was her best friend.

2322
01:34:13,631 --> 01:34:15,490
She could ride it like a horse.
You could tell him to sit,

2323
01:34:15,491 --> 01:34:16,200
stand,
move.

2324
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:20,740
She'd do anything but to in her eyes to
her purpose in life was to make sure

2325
01:34:20,741 --> 01:34:23,050
that this child is say that's a man.
That was other pit bulls.

2326
01:34:23,051 --> 01:34:26,170
I know big boy on pitfall Kennels,
his brother he and changed.

2327
01:34:26,171 --> 01:34:26,880
They have one.
They,

2328
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:28,510
they have amazing dog.
Yeah.

2329
01:34:28,630 --> 01:34:31,840
There's a lot of those out there.
There's a lot of great pit bulls out

2330
01:34:31,841 --> 01:34:33,610
there.
The only problem with pit bulls is they

2331
01:34:33,611 --> 01:34:35,860
have an aggression towards other dogs.
They do.

2332
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:38,410
Absolutely.
Do you have another dog around?

2333
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:41,740
There's likely going to be a scrap and
it got to be exhausting for me.

2334
01:34:41,770 --> 01:34:43,240
I understand that.
Well I'm,

2335
01:34:43,241 --> 01:34:46,240
I'm,
I'm pro one or two like my thing is I

2336
01:34:46,241 --> 01:34:48,010
only have,
you should only have one or two pitch.

2337
01:34:48,011 --> 01:34:52,090
You should have one that's dedicated to
you and the family we should have two

2338
01:34:52,091 --> 01:34:53,830
pits.
Got are part of the family and they

2339
01:34:53,831 --> 01:34:54,700
understand,
you know,

2340
01:34:54,701 --> 01:34:56,460
who's the dominant and who's the Alpha
News?

2341
01:34:56,461 --> 01:34:58,010
A Beta.
I had

2342
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:01,460
one pair that I got from the pound and
she had been the pound for like five

2343
01:35:01,461 --> 01:35:02,150
months.
Yeah.

2344
01:35:02,150 --> 01:35:04,790
She was in the Ellie animal shelter.
She was only 11 months old.

2345
01:35:04,791 --> 01:35:06,080
She was a prison dog.
Basically.

2346
01:35:06,081 --> 01:35:07,820
She just,
most of her life had been locked up in

2347
01:35:07,821 --> 01:35:12,290
this little cage and that dog,
if anybody else wanted to get pet,

2348
01:35:12,830 --> 01:35:15,680
she would get up to them and go get the
fuck outta here.

2349
01:35:15,681 --> 01:35:18,890
She would show her teeth and ground him.
She want anybody getting pet by her.

2350
01:35:19,490 --> 01:35:21,320
She would,
any other dogs tried to move in?

2351
01:35:21,321 --> 01:35:22,970
She would growl at him,
box him out.

2352
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,440
She box him out.
Like check them.

2353
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:26,540
Like if you're trying to pet one of the
other dogs like no,

2354
01:35:26,541 --> 01:35:26,810
no,
no.

2355
01:35:26,810 --> 01:35:29,270
She'd get right up in there.
You know what I found with them?

2356
01:35:29,570 --> 01:35:31,760
They are like children in that they
throw tantrums.

2357
01:35:31,790 --> 01:35:34,280
Yeah.
So if they get lonely and they get

2358
01:35:34,281 --> 01:35:36,080
lonely without you,
they miss you.

2359
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:37,340
Yeah.
They'll do shit.

2360
01:35:37,341 --> 01:35:39,260
Like,
just tap the fucking cell or the house

2361
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:41,330
or to the laundry.
And then you'll get there.

2362
01:35:41,331 --> 01:35:43,090
You'll call them,
you're looking for them and they're

2363
01:35:43,110 --> 01:35:43,581
like,
oh shit,

2364
01:35:43,581 --> 01:35:46,430
I fucked up.
And they're hiding in her room and shit.

2365
01:35:46,431 --> 01:35:47,270
Like they,
they,

2366
01:35:47,271 --> 01:35:49,190
um,
they're brilliant little fuckers.

2367
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:50,180
You know what?
My man,

2368
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:53,030
my man Cielo had had a bunch of great
pitch back in the day.

2369
01:35:53,031 --> 01:35:55,100
So I want to get a pit bull.
I'm declaring that today.

2370
01:35:55,101 --> 01:35:56,240
Shane and kate.
Tell me what to do.

2371
01:35:56,270 --> 01:35:57,650
Wow.
That's happening.

2372
01:35:57,651 --> 01:36:00,230
As long as you're responsible owner,
train it.

2373
01:36:00,231 --> 01:36:02,090
Well,
make sure it doesn't get loose.

2374
01:36:02,150 --> 01:36:04,310
Yup.
And I don't believe in fighting dogs no.

2375
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:05,173
Now to fight.
No.

2376
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:06,180
Fuck that.
Um,

2377
01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:07,143
they're,
uh,

2378
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:08,970
they're escape artists too.
You gotta be careful though.

2379
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:11,210
You fuckers can climb a fence.
They can climb a fence.

2380
01:36:11,211 --> 01:36:12,890
They're smart enough to open the gate.
Yeah,

2381
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:17,450
I've seen him run up a tree.
My oldest daughter has a tiny little dog

2382
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:19,700
and a,
it's one of the smartest dogs I've ever

2383
01:36:19,701 --> 01:36:23,390
seen because it's a,
it's part Chihuahua and part a

2384
01:36:23,391 --> 01:36:25,100
Australian shepherd dog,
I think.

2385
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:30,230
But it's the only dog I've ever had
where it's Paul got caught on the leash

2386
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:34,110
and it lifted his leg up and put it
behind the behind the leash.

2387
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:35,750
Oh Wow.
I've never seen a dog do that.

2388
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:40,900
Dogs get that one arm and then fuck
this dog looked at that one.

2389
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:44,210
Oh,
this is easy.

2390
01:36:44,210 --> 01:36:44,931
Oh Shit.
My bad.

2391
01:36:44,931 --> 01:36:46,630
And I looked at them like,
you let a motherfucker,

2392
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:49,790
there's smart little dude.
My wife had an Australian shepherd when

2393
01:36:49,791 --> 01:36:51,680
I met her Mfi.
Yeah.

2394
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:53,960
That,
that smart fucking dogs.

2395
01:36:54,590 --> 01:36:57,130
Chihuahuas are smart making dog.
Oh yeah.

2396
01:36:57,420 --> 01:36:59,390
They can be me.
Yeah.

2397
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:01,510
Surprisingly.
What's the weirdest thing is that all

2398
01:37:01,530 --> 01:37:03,560
those came from wolves.
Everything came from a wolf.

2399
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:04,790
Yeah.
All of them.

2400
01:37:04,970 --> 01:37:06,110
Yeah.
That's nuts.

2401
01:37:06,950 --> 01:37:09,380
Every dog.
Something key that we took it back and I

2402
01:37:09,381 --> 01:37:10,970
say this,
some people in my community,

2403
01:37:10,971 --> 01:37:15,240
but in humans evolved from monkeys.
Ooh.

2404
01:37:15,860 --> 01:37:20,300
He's saying kind of Asheville get,
so that was the words of killer Mike.

2405
01:37:20,301 --> 01:37:21,770
If you're just listening.
Yeah.

2406
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:25,340
We definitely didn't pop up just like we
are.

2407
01:37:25,341 --> 01:37:26,480
I don't believe that.
Anyway.

2408
01:37:26,481 --> 01:37:28,370
What do you think happened?
I don't know.

2409
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:30,470
I don't know what happened,
but my wife says,

2410
01:37:30,471 --> 01:37:31,600
joking,
you got to know my wife.

2411
01:37:31,730 --> 01:37:33,170
She's,
she's very cool,

2412
01:37:33,171 --> 01:37:34,580
very down to earth.
She's my best friend.

2413
01:37:34,910 --> 01:37:39,080
She speaks in his thick creole.
He like accent and she'll just say

2414
01:37:39,081 --> 01:37:41,180
things blindly out of nowhere there.
It's fucking hilarious.

2415
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:43,130
And she'll,
we're watching planting today and she

2416
01:37:43,131 --> 01:37:44,300
says,
you know,

2417
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:48,620
people get mad about it,
but shit,

2418
01:37:49,310 --> 01:37:53,510
when you look at them,
human beings do look like monkeys.

2419
01:37:53,511 --> 01:37:55,070
I mean,
we probably were swinging the fuck

2420
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:57,870
around a few thousand and I'm just
thinking of myself.

2421
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:01,990
You do realize in the black community,
that's an insult to even call us.

2422
01:38:02,190 --> 01:38:03,480
And she's just,
because she's black,

2423
01:38:03,481 --> 01:38:05,520
of course,
she's just like a man.

2424
01:38:06,910 --> 01:38:08,850
She pointed at the screen.
I was just like,

2425
01:38:09,330 --> 01:38:10,620
yeah,
we probably a fault.

2426
01:38:10,650 --> 01:38:11,171
You know,
and,

2427
01:38:11,171 --> 01:38:11,970
and,
and you know,

2428
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:14,070
it,
people can have whatever debates they

2429
01:38:14,071 --> 01:38:15,060
want to file it.
But,

2430
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:18,000
you know,
I think that we act a lot just like,

2431
01:38:18,030 --> 01:38:21,720
I think human beings are arrogant
because we think we can communicate and

2432
01:38:21,721 --> 01:38:25,650
we can use tools to build shit.
But basically we're hairless apes and

2433
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:27,630
you know,
just cause we can communicate doesn't

2434
01:38:27,631 --> 01:38:28,950
mean we're communicating the right
things.

2435
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:32,280
Animals live in harmony with nature and
a very different way.

2436
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:34,200
You know what I mean?
They kill for hunger,

2437
01:38:34,230 --> 01:38:36,810
you know what I mean?
AIDS can't kill for reasons that are non

2438
01:38:36,811 --> 01:38:38,070
hunger related and things of that
nature.

2439
01:38:38,071 --> 01:38:40,470
So we know that's a part of us.
But I,

2440
01:38:40,471 --> 01:38:41,580
I honestly think,
yeah,

2441
01:38:41,581 --> 01:38:45,570
I think we evolved from something that
didn't necessarily look like us.

2442
01:38:45,571 --> 01:38:46,700
Yeah.
Yeah.

2443
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:50,640
If that may have swing from a tree where
the most advanced of the primates,

2444
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:55,380
but we exhibit characteristics so we can
see in the lower primates and if you pay

2445
01:38:55,381 --> 01:39:00,030
attention to all the top scientists who
have spent studying human evolution,

2446
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:03,210
they're all pretty much in agreement
that there was something that we were

2447
01:39:03,211 --> 01:39:05,340
all similar too.
And they all branched off at a bunch of

2448
01:39:05,341 --> 01:39:06,540
different ways.
It's amazing.

2449
01:39:06,541 --> 01:39:08,670
They keep finding new forms of people
too.

2450
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:10,670
Yeah,
I saw why they just stopped destined.

2451
01:39:10,670 --> 01:39:12,370
Noveon or something like that.
That's what it's called.

2452
01:39:12,371 --> 01:39:14,220
Not another,
the one from Russia.

2453
01:39:14,250 --> 01:39:17,160
So do you think yellow do you take alien
has really popped down.

2454
01:39:17,190 --> 01:39:19,680
Fuck the monkey and we popped out nine
months later.

2455
01:39:19,710 --> 01:39:20,580
Here we go.
Oh look,

2456
01:39:20,581 --> 01:39:22,230
that would be the most fun.
Yeah,

2457
01:39:22,231 --> 01:39:25,800
I think so.
I think if a pit stop happened and what

2458
01:39:25,801 --> 01:39:28,080
was the movie that was really crappy and
not as good as it should have been?

2459
01:39:28,081 --> 01:39:31,630
That was the aliens like precursor
something showed essentially where can

2460
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:32,940
atheists atheist,
right.

2461
01:39:32,941 --> 01:39:34,320
They should have been very good at
theory.

2462
01:39:34,620 --> 01:39:35,371
But yeah,
I think,

2463
01:39:35,371 --> 01:39:36,810
I think that that that's the
possibility.

2464
01:39:36,811 --> 01:39:38,820
Aliens were chick hanging out at the
moon,

2465
01:39:38,821 --> 01:39:39,241
said,
Yo,

2466
01:39:39,241 --> 01:39:43,080
look at the blue plans to fucking go see
with and say Yo [inaudible] he looks

2467
01:39:43,081 --> 01:39:44,970
great.
Fuck the shit out of it.

2468
01:39:44,971 --> 01:39:46,800
Got Out of there.
And the next thing you know you have war

2469
01:39:46,801 --> 01:39:48,870
and pestilence and violence and poverty
and MMA.

2470
01:39:49,170 --> 01:39:54,170
Mm and joints.
But one monkey that accelerated stop

2471
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:58,680
past way past all the other ones.
Like one invention,

2472
01:39:58,710 --> 01:40:01,020
the invent,
the ability to communicate and the

2473
01:40:01,021 --> 01:40:03,420
ability to having opposable thumbs,
the ability to communicate.

2474
01:40:03,421 --> 01:40:06,270
And then it started advancing.
As soon as it started talking,

2475
01:40:07,230 --> 01:40:10,620
started figuring out ways to express
itself to each other,

2476
01:40:10,621 --> 01:40:13,110
and then they started making things and
they're off to the races and the next

2477
01:40:13,111 --> 01:40:15,150
thing you know,
a couple hundred thousand years later,

2478
01:40:15,151 --> 01:40:17,820
the world's different Pune.
It's like this thing erupts and then

2479
01:40:17,821 --> 01:40:19,710
just covers the world,
which is shit.

2480
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:21,060
Yeah,
and that's us.

2481
01:40:21,090 --> 01:40:24,270
How do you subscribe to the theory that
we just may be a virus and the earth may

2482
01:40:24,271 --> 01:40:26,370
be getting rid of us?
Well,

2483
01:40:27,630 --> 01:40:29,250
no one would like to think that.
Right,

2484
01:40:29,251 --> 01:40:31,470
but the reason you call a virus or
something,

2485
01:40:31,471 --> 01:40:33,930
it's just an a,
a word that's been assigned to a living

2486
01:40:33,931 --> 01:40:35,220
organism and a system.

2487
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:37,230
By biomedical science,
I mean,

2488
01:40:37,231 --> 01:40:39,840
we all know what a viruses,
it's a real thing.

2489
01:40:40,050 --> 01:40:42,780
It's amazing that these brilliant people
have discovered it and come up with

2490
01:40:42,781 --> 01:40:46,950
vaccines to stop and prevent them,
but it's a some sort of a life form

2491
01:40:46,951 --> 01:40:47,690
really.
Essentially.

2492
01:40:47,690 --> 01:40:48,060
Yeah.
Now,

2493
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:52,210
if we looked at the earth as being a
living organism and so we should we,

2494
01:40:52,470 --> 01:40:56,110
it's certainly you can make an argument
that it's a kind of a life form that

2495
01:40:56,111 --> 01:40:59,890
it's a host of massive amounts of life
of all the life.

2496
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:00,770
Yeah.
Um,

2497
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:04,060
you would think that maybe some of those
things would not be in harmony.

2498
01:41:04,061 --> 01:41:06,370
Just like some of those things in a
human body aren't in harmony,

2499
01:41:06,610 --> 01:41:08,590
right?
Your gut bacteria is off or you got a

2500
01:41:08,591 --> 01:41:12,730
cold because there's bacteria in your
body that you picked up from a fucking

2501
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:15,180
bathroom somewhere.
Whatever you're saying,

2502
01:41:15,730 --> 01:41:20,730
all that stuff could easily apply to how
human beings interact with the earth.

2503
01:41:21,010 --> 01:41:22,710
Are we the virus though?
Like,

2504
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:25,510
cause when you got to look at it at some
point the earth is,

2505
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:28,870
or you or the theory is it's a living,
breathing organism.

2506
01:41:28,990 --> 01:41:30,460
Here's what I can say for sure.
Okay.

2507
01:41:30,490 --> 01:41:34,660
We are the virus to the ocean because we
don't even live in it and think about

2508
01:41:34,661 --> 01:41:35,890
it.
That's life.

2509
01:41:36,310 --> 01:41:39,670
Before we were monkeys,
we were something that crawled out of

2510
01:41:39,671 --> 01:41:40,660
the ocean.
Right,

2511
01:41:40,980 --> 01:41:42,070
right.
Imagine if the earth,

2512
01:41:42,130 --> 01:41:43,330
the ocean was,
I mean,

2513
01:41:43,331 --> 01:41:46,870
I don't know what it was like.
We are getting a hundred really stone.

2514
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:49,310
This is what our fans were.
Stone is,

2515
01:41:49,510 --> 01:41:51,760
fuck,
I don't know what the ocean was like a

2516
01:41:51,761 --> 01:41:55,090
couple of hundred thousand years ago
before people really became what we are

2517
01:41:55,091 --> 01:41:57,230
tool to using.
You know,

2518
01:41:57,380 --> 01:42:00,430
people that figured out how to get out
into the ocean and capture fish.

2519
01:42:01,090 --> 01:42:05,590
But imagine if you could see it,
imagine if you could see an image of how

2520
01:42:05,591 --> 01:42:09,610
many fucking fish were out there 200,000
years ago versus how many are now.

2521
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:14,620
It's like they lived next to a vampire
that just keeps sucking the life.

2522
01:42:14,621 --> 01:42:18,850
Avid.
I bet we've killed 50% of all life in

2523
01:42:18,851 --> 01:42:20,050
the ocean.
That's what I'm saying.

2524
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:23,500
Felt like we have to think of ourselves
at some point.

2525
01:42:23,501 --> 01:42:28,040
You gotta say maybe the best thing human
beings could do for the earth is,

2526
01:42:28,150 --> 01:42:29,920
is to aid humanity.
Maybe.

2527
01:42:29,921 --> 01:42:34,060
But maybe viruses are there for a reason
to maybe that it all needs to exist.

2528
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:36,130
There needs to be some sort of a
balance.

2529
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:37,990
Where are we trying to eliminate bad
things.

2530
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:41,140
Maybe they do serve some sort of weird
fucking purpose.

2531
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:44,240
So even even in that we find purpose as
is,

2532
01:42:44,260 --> 01:42:48,400
that's the talent of humans.
The ability to adjust and make logic out

2533
01:42:48,401 --> 01:42:50,290
of us being here.
Yeah.

2534
01:42:50,291 --> 01:42:52,180
Well and to keep moving and make more of
us.

2535
01:42:52,210 --> 01:42:55,030
This China make it to the moon.
They grew cotton on the moon apparently

2536
01:42:55,031 --> 01:42:55,360
already.

2537
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:56,530
Right.
How they grew something in the moon,

2538
01:42:56,531 --> 01:42:57,550
but it died.
Yeah,

2539
01:42:57,610 --> 01:43:01,270
it died quickly.
I was happy that it was that cotton

2540
01:43:01,271 --> 01:43:05,050
because seeing as how they're their
biggest investor in Africa and China was

2541
01:43:05,051 --> 01:43:08,080
growing cotton that didn't go well for
black people 500 years ago.

2542
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:10,860
So I was just like,
please don't let cotton grown in the

2543
01:43:10,860 --> 01:43:11,693
moon.
I was like,

2544
01:43:12,070 --> 01:43:14,020
I don't want to transmit Atlantic slave
trade.

2545
01:43:14,620 --> 01:43:16,030
I have to learn Mandarin.
This shit.

2546
01:43:16,330 --> 01:43:21,330
So do you think they actually set up
shop before us or as American steel

2547
01:43:22,421 --> 01:43:25,600
number one cause they feels like,
I feel like we lost that day.

2548
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:27,370
We went,
China landed on the moon.

2549
01:43:27,430 --> 01:43:28,450
Yeah.
I feel like,

2550
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:29,860
I feel like,
oh shit.

2551
01:43:29,890 --> 01:43:31,450
You know,
I've grown up being,

2552
01:43:31,451 --> 01:43:32,710
you know,
like I'm black,

2553
01:43:32,711 --> 01:43:34,780
I'm American,
but I like I come here,

2554
01:43:34,830 --> 01:43:36,010
a lot of people I'm saying I like
America.

2555
01:43:36,011 --> 01:43:36,700
Like America.

2556
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:37,600
Yeah,
exactly.

2557
01:43:37,601 --> 01:43:42,020
I feel like we're a bad like Frederick
Douglass when asked what he leave was I

2558
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:43,020
answered,
you know,

2559
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:46,330
like what the fuck am I going to leave
for when I see something like the moon

2560
01:43:46,331 --> 01:43:49,390
landing the China,
the growing the plants and landing

2561
01:43:49,391 --> 01:43:50,420
there,
there what,

2562
01:43:50,430 --> 01:43:51,620
what,
what was it?

2563
01:43:51,621 --> 01:43:52,190
Was it,
uh,

2564
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:54,530
what,
what was the kind of ship that they

2565
01:43:54,531 --> 01:43:56,140
landed on the moon?
I'm not,

2566
01:43:56,141 --> 01:43:59,510
I put one on the moment.
Apparently landing on the dark side

2567
01:43:59,511 --> 01:44:01,370
though.
Right on the side that we didn't make it

2568
01:44:01,371 --> 01:44:04,160
to all or just went and told me that
video of it was a drone.

2569
01:44:04,161 --> 01:44:05,030
Right.
Is that what it was?

2570
01:44:05,031 --> 01:44:07,280
Some sort of a drone?
I think of that.

2571
01:44:07,281 --> 01:44:11,090
I honestly think about that as a win for
science and for innovation.

2572
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:14,720
I don't think about it in terms of like
nations cause I feel like that is done

2573
01:44:14,721 --> 01:44:15,470
by scientists.

2574
01:44:15,470 --> 01:44:18,410
That's done by the wizards.
And so are you saying we're going to

2575
01:44:18,411 --> 01:44:21,020
steal the scientists because when
Kennedy gave the fucking speech,

2576
01:44:21,290 --> 01:44:24,740
Kennedy made it seem like the moon
landing was going to make us the

2577
01:44:24,741 --> 01:44:27,530
preeminent nation.
And I think that's the propaganda

2578
01:44:27,531 --> 01:44:28,850
China's going to run it.
You don't think,

2579
01:44:29,030 --> 01:44:31,580
well,
I think they have some fucking amazing

2580
01:44:31,581 --> 01:44:33,950
technology and to deny that would be
ridiculous.

2581
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:36,260
But I also think that it's important
that everybody,

2582
01:44:36,890 --> 01:44:39,890
everybody be competitive in this.
Like if they,

2583
01:44:39,891 --> 01:44:41,330
if you really want to make things
better,

2584
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:44,060
you're not gonna,
you're not gonna do that in a vacuum.

2585
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:47,720
What helps the technological innovation
and one of the reasons why it's so

2586
01:44:47,721 --> 01:44:49,550
accelerated as there's so many people
working on it,

2587
01:44:49,820 --> 01:44:52,220
it's not just a few people trying to
make cell phones better.

2588
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:54,860
I got fucking so many geniuses out
there,

2589
01:44:54,980 --> 01:44:57,320
so when I see something like this,
like they landed on the moon,

2590
01:44:57,321 --> 01:44:58,460
I go did geniuses.

2591
01:44:58,460 --> 01:45:00,440
One you just gave me hope.
Yeah,

2592
01:45:00,860 --> 01:45:02,690
they're Chinese people,
but they're just people.

2593
01:45:02,750 --> 01:45:04,130
We're all just people.
Absolutely.

2594
01:45:04,210 --> 01:45:05,900
You know,
and the idea that they're going to all

2595
01:45:05,901 --> 01:45:09,860
get those people on that side to think
the same way is what we're worried

2596
01:45:09,861 --> 01:45:10,251
about.
Right.

2597
01:45:10,251 --> 01:45:12,350
That we're,
it'd be US versus them and their

2598
01:45:12,351 --> 01:45:16,280
technology is going to impact our lives
the way we frame it as a country.

2599
01:45:16,390 --> 01:45:17,480
Yeah,
we always worry about that.

2600
01:45:17,540 --> 01:45:19,940
But you have to admit that that's what,
that's the way we frame it.

2601
01:45:19,941 --> 01:45:21,920
But if you look at the history of the
world that's been,

2602
01:45:21,950 --> 01:45:25,190
that happens so many times.
I think it makes sense to be worried

2603
01:45:25,191 --> 01:45:27,230
about the rest of the world.
I get it.

2604
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:29,090
You know,
I'm on it and I'm on this side of the

2605
01:45:29,091 --> 01:45:31,160
fence so you know,
no problem with that.

2606
01:45:31,161 --> 01:45:32,730
But you know,
just,

2607
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:34,790
you know,
I'm an American,

2608
01:45:34,791 --> 01:45:36,140
so that's what we want to know.

2609
01:45:36,140 --> 01:45:36,760
If,
if,

2610
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:39,020
if red October is going to happen
tomorrow.

2611
01:45:39,110 --> 01:45:41,480
Fuck man,
I think Russians don't hate us.

2612
01:45:41,630 --> 01:45:44,210
I don't think anybody has a quarrel with
anybody over there.

2613
01:45:44,211 --> 01:45:47,510
It's the government.
That's what's the hustle is that the

2614
01:45:47,511 --> 01:45:50,980
real interaction is between a very small
amount of people that involves all,

2615
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,300
these are the people that are with them.
For some strange reason,

2616
01:45:53,330 --> 01:45:56,210
I think they should just be thrown
essentially in a stadium to fight to

2617
01:45:56,211 --> 01:45:59,450
their death.
Gluten would be the king of the world.

2618
01:46:00,230 --> 01:46:02,990
Fuck everybody up.
Him and that other dude that runs the

2619
01:46:02,991 --> 01:46:04,650
other little country next door.
That was unreal.

2620
01:46:04,950 --> 01:46:05,810
Yeah,
yeah,

2621
01:46:05,910 --> 01:46:08,600
yeah.
That guy is a huge supporter of MMA.

2622
01:46:08,990 --> 01:46:12,080
Fucking bad ass was bad.
There's some bees over there.

2623
01:46:13,270 --> 01:46:15,500
You and how bad Putin would fuck up
trump.

2624
01:46:15,590 --> 01:46:19,880
Oh Christ.
You can't a fight to the death with

2625
01:46:19,881 --> 01:46:23,290
Putin.
I would actually probably bit pooed

2626
01:46:23,390 --> 01:46:24,530
versus Obama too.

2627
01:46:24,950 --> 01:46:25,850
Yeah,
for sure.

2628
01:46:26,450 --> 01:46:28,490
Look,
Obama is probably better than a debate.

2629
01:46:28,730 --> 01:46:29,840
Yeah.
Pooh who is a real,

2630
01:46:29,841 --> 01:46:30,980
exactly.
That's what I'm saying.

2631
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:35,570
Like a lot of real real can we,
you'd have to go all the way.

2632
01:46:37,220 --> 01:46:41,270
Bush one I think was bad ass.
Maybe as a younger man that need you to

2633
01:46:41,271 --> 01:46:43,000
leave the CIA,
you gotta have some killer in.

2634
01:46:43,010 --> 01:46:44,030
Yes.
You know,

2635
01:46:44,150 --> 01:46:46,070
he was a tough guy,
but I probably have to get all the way

2636
01:46:46,071 --> 01:46:49,010
back to Kennedy in terms of physical
prowess and his back was bad.

2637
01:46:49,740 --> 01:46:52,320
I think you've got to go to Abraham
Lincoln when Lincoln.

2638
01:46:52,321 --> 01:46:53,100
Yeah,
he was wiring.

2639
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:56,160
He wasn't that farmer bill farmer
strength.

2640
01:46:56,161 --> 01:47:00,600
He did wiring those old dudes back then.
We had to carry everything true.

2641
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:01,890
They didn't,
you know,

2642
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:05,400
farm work was real work just carried
everything everywhere.

2643
01:47:06,030 --> 01:47:08,430
All those dudes are just wiring as fuck.
He was a wrestler too.

2644
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:09,650
Yeah.
Are,

2645
01:47:09,890 --> 01:47:11,000
yeah,
so he's,

2646
01:47:11,010 --> 01:47:12,600
he's,
he's beloved in my community.

2647
01:47:12,601 --> 01:47:13,740
We like them a lot.
No,

2648
01:47:13,770 --> 01:47:14,603
I get it.
Yeah.

2649
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:17,220
He wrote this little thing called
emancipation proclamation.

2650
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:20,880
Did you see that stupid fucking movie
where they had him as a vampire slayer?

2651
01:47:21,180 --> 01:47:22,170
Did you ever see that?
Nah,

2652
01:47:22,171 --> 01:47:25,320
I saw the trailer and decided maybe
that's not the one for me.

2653
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:29,070
That was one of the ones you happier
kids don't ask you to go see.

2654
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:30,960
Yeah.
Did Jamie,

2655
01:47:30,961 --> 01:47:32,760
didn't you say it was based on a graphic
novel?

2656
01:47:33,250 --> 01:47:36,180
Yeah.
So it was like a fun comic book that

2657
01:47:36,181 --> 01:47:38,730
somebody made and then they turned it
into a movie as a movie.

2658
01:47:38,731 --> 01:47:41,820
It was like so weird as a graphic and I
will probably work better.

2659
01:47:41,890 --> 01:47:44,170
Yeah.
There's some things that work that just

2660
01:47:44,171 --> 01:47:45,720
stay in their world.
Right?

2661
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:47,790
Like there's some realize that movie
though.

2662
01:47:47,990 --> 01:47:48,840
Who said the question?

2663
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:51,300
That's it.
There's a fun movie.

2664
01:47:51,810 --> 01:47:55,090
I mean it was dumb and fun,
but I'm just saying that's perfect.

2665
01:47:55,170 --> 01:47:55,771
I liked it.
Yeah,

2666
01:47:55,771 --> 01:47:57,340
but who gets it?
Who gets that movie?

2667
01:47:57,390 --> 01:47:58,550
Who?
Who what?

2668
01:47:58,950 --> 01:47:59,783
The pitch?
Yeah.

2669
01:48:00,210 --> 01:48:03,270
So Abraham Lincoln,
he can to kill vampires.

2670
01:48:04,110 --> 01:48:05,760
Vampires,
but an ax.

2671
01:48:05,790 --> 01:48:06,630
What?
What?

2672
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:09,550
Yeah.
They probably said another president

2673
01:48:09,551 --> 01:48:10,500
first and they said,
Ooh.

2674
01:48:10,501 --> 01:48:11,530
And then they say,
Hey Bradley,

2675
01:48:11,910 --> 01:48:13,300
what's up?
Tim Burton?

2676
01:48:13,301 --> 01:48:14,160
So,
oh,

2677
01:48:14,220 --> 01:48:16,440
I love that dude.
He's wacky though.

2678
01:48:16,650 --> 01:48:18,210
He doesn't get wacky stuff.
Yeah.

2679
01:48:18,211 --> 01:48:19,680
It was a beetle juice or something to
what was,

2680
01:48:19,690 --> 01:48:20,930
who else was tim burns.
Yeah,

2681
01:48:20,950 --> 01:48:21,910
yeah,
yeah.

2682
01:48:22,430 --> 01:48:26,280
Tim.
And he's so can we get a John Woo film?

2683
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:29,520
So can we get another hard boiled or as
a killer could we get,

2684
01:48:29,521 --> 01:48:30,690
yeah.
When was the last man?

2685
01:48:30,691 --> 01:48:32,790
It's been a long time and it's American
movies,

2686
01:48:32,791 --> 01:48:34,260
although good.
We're nothing like,

2687
01:48:34,550 --> 01:48:35,850
well,
nothing like the foreign films.

2688
01:48:36,240 --> 01:48:39,420
Yeah.
Hyper violent stylistically beautiful.

2689
01:48:39,690 --> 01:48:42,900
Slow motion was use crazy.
Him or Tarantino.

2690
01:48:42,901 --> 01:48:45,190
I just love to drop a movie this year.
Yeah.

2691
01:48:45,570 --> 01:48:48,810
I think his style heavily influenced
John Wick.

2692
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:50,430
I will.
Yes.

2693
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:52,500
100% right.
Hey one bro.

2694
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:53,700
Hell yeah.
Damn.

2695
01:48:53,730 --> 01:48:54,890
Sorry Kathy.
Get the pound.

2696
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:58,870
Yeah.
I was wondering why the Fuck I love John

2697
01:48:58,870 --> 01:49:00,600
Wayne moved.
That's hyper violent.

2698
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:03,130
Hyper violence.
Beautiful old school cars too.

2699
01:49:04,890 --> 01:49:08,130
When you're on the guns,
the magic of the slow moving Su and the

2700
01:49:08,131 --> 01:49:11,370
lead characters.
Kiano reads as bad ass man dresses

2701
01:49:11,371 --> 01:49:14,220
impeccably to go assassinate people.
Absolutely perfect.

2702
01:49:14,250 --> 01:49:17,910
Perfect attire hit me.
Come on,

2703
01:49:17,911 --> 01:49:21,660
man.
Drive around a 70 Chevelle ss as a male

2704
01:49:21,661 --> 01:49:22,920
mach one.
Come on,

2705
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:24,870
come on.
True.

2706
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:25,881
That's a,
that.

2707
01:49:25,881 --> 01:49:28,830
That movie is amazing.
That is really the second one I liked.

2708
01:49:29,250 --> 01:49:32,340
I love the first and I think I'm going
to let love the third.

2709
01:49:32,370 --> 01:49:33,203
I'm hoping.
Please.

2710
01:49:33,390 --> 01:49:35,610
I didn't see any cars though.
I saw the previews.

2711
01:49:35,611 --> 01:49:37,120
I didn't see cars.
I saw a motorcycle.

2712
01:49:37,130 --> 01:49:39,910
Just got to give him a car.
I always called him motorcycle.

2713
01:49:39,970 --> 01:49:42,270
Fuck.
He got to give him a car.

2714
01:49:42,271 --> 01:49:44,820
People don't understand.
Men want to go to see that car.

2715
01:49:44,850 --> 01:49:47,530
Motorcycles bring out the teenage boy.
So yeah,

2716
01:49:47,590 --> 01:49:48,130
that's true.

2717
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:49,530
I remember ordering cycle.
We're on,

2718
01:49:49,540 --> 01:49:51,340
I even have a motorcycle and my mom's
like,

2719
01:49:51,540 --> 01:49:53,470
you're going to get a magazine issue.
Has a cycle world.

2720
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:55,960
That's true.
Right muscle causing for old men.

2721
01:49:56,590 --> 01:49:59,590
Teenage boys want Ninja bikes.
Let me tell you something and I want to

2722
01:49:59,591 --> 01:50:02,500
share the secret with it where a lot of
people don't know is all white guys and

2723
01:50:02,501 --> 01:50:06,100
young black men has the same interest.
They both like young black women.

2724
01:50:06,370 --> 01:50:11,370
They both like muscle cars.
They both like slightly gaudy jewelry,

2725
01:50:11,620 --> 01:50:13,360
you know,
not working and money,

2726
01:50:13,361 --> 01:50:15,280
you know what I'm saying?
But muscle car to crowd.

2727
01:50:15,281 --> 01:50:18,580
If you go to Amica him auction,
you're going to see like you know young

2728
01:50:18,581 --> 01:50:21,850
black guys who,
oh I guys talking,

2729
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:23,080
you know,
talking to one another.

2730
01:50:23,081 --> 01:50:24,820
This is one of the most beautiful sites
I've ever seen.

2731
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:26,830
That's Larry.
Just after Mike and old guy,

2732
01:50:26,831 --> 01:50:29,470
I met at a meekum cow coming from and
become auction.

2733
01:50:29,770 --> 01:50:31,030
There's a bunch of those auctions,
right?

2734
01:50:31,031 --> 01:50:35,170
Like is Barrett Jackson Meek is unique.
It's a working man's Barrett Jackson.

2735
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:36,220
Oh,
what's the difference?

2736
01:50:36,670 --> 01:50:38,560
You can actually afford the cars that
she said.

2737
01:50:38,561 --> 01:50:40,840
You know,
bear Jackson is beautiful cars,

2738
01:50:40,841 --> 01:50:43,840
but you know you're going,
you know I'm spending money and they got

2739
01:50:43,841 --> 01:50:46,070
cards you can get for,
but bear bear.

2740
01:50:46,150 --> 01:50:48,670
But with that said,
they say the inspection processes better

2741
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:49,750
and Mika,
Mika,

2742
01:50:49,751 --> 01:50:51,790
Mr Guys,
a blue collar guy might've retired,

2743
01:50:51,791 --> 01:50:53,380
but he wants to go to the oxen.
He goes,

2744
01:50:53,570 --> 01:50:55,330
he gets a great car,
but he's probably going to know

2745
01:50:55,331 --> 01:50:57,040
something about cars and look it over
and sell.

2746
01:50:58,250 --> 01:50:59,320
Yeah,
man.

2747
01:50:59,710 --> 01:51:04,160
There's something about the comradery of
a fellow muscle car enthusiasts.

2748
01:51:04,180 --> 01:51:06,370
Yes.
You know when you could find a dude

2749
01:51:06,371 --> 01:51:09,790
who's also just as stupid as you about
to pour money in,

2750
01:51:09,791 --> 01:51:13,240
something that's never going to fully
make you Haffi as you want to be.

2751
01:51:13,270 --> 01:51:15,280
There's some guys that I'm friends with,
it's like this.

2752
01:51:15,610 --> 01:51:18,670
There's an extra bond because they're
just a stupid about cars.

2753
01:51:18,671 --> 01:51:21,580
Is I am man.
Shouts out to my man Ryan Ball.

2754
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:23,020
Um,
you've given more.

2755
01:51:23,021 --> 01:51:26,200
Shouts out than anyone in here because
this is what you're supposed to do here.

2756
01:51:26,201 --> 01:51:31,201
He shouts out to Ron Paul and Mike Musto
muscle.

2757
01:51:31,241 --> 01:51:33,550
Yup.
Mike has my 96 impala,

2758
01:51:33,790 --> 01:51:36,460
which I got from Shauna.
Donald Topia shouts out to Shaun.

2759
01:51:36,850 --> 01:51:40,090
Got It from him,
got the 96 impala with under,

2760
01:51:40,180 --> 01:51:43,210
with under 1100 miles on it at the time.
Um,

2761
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:45,330
ron did some slight adjustment.
He works over at Ford.

2762
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:47,980
Yaddo does make the car even beautiful.
Just tweaked it,

2763
01:51:47,981 --> 01:51:50,580
Lord it a little bit,
did some cool stuff and mike featured

2764
01:51:50,590 --> 01:51:51,610
it,
so that's nice.

2765
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:53,890
Yeah.
I have different people that are pockets

2766
01:51:53,891 --> 01:51:56,500
in my life that love you.
So as I'm shutting people out,

2767
01:51:56,501 --> 01:51:58,210
I appreciate you letting me do a bit,
you know,

2768
01:51:58,211 --> 01:51:59,390
I know they'll appreciate it.

2769
01:51:59,390 --> 01:52:00,290
You know what?
That's awesome.

2770
01:52:00,830 --> 01:52:02,140
Joe fucking Rogan.
Thank you.

2771
01:52:02,141 --> 01:52:03,970
Your killer fucking month.
It's a big deal.

2772
01:52:03,971 --> 01:52:04,720
I'm here.
Mike.

2773
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:06,280
Mike Tyson was here.
I know.

2774
01:52:06,281 --> 01:52:07,990
He was all right.
Back to Mike.

2775
01:52:07,991 --> 01:52:11,170
My stuff shocking about how weird it was
to meet Mike Tyson.

2776
01:52:12,420 --> 01:52:15,250
It's so strange to hang out and talk to
them like party.

2777
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:19,390
He was so iconic that whenever you're
around him park there's like 10% of you

2778
01:52:19,391 --> 01:52:21,660
that has to go holy shit.
It's Mike Tyson's,

2779
01:52:21,910 --> 01:52:25,510
no matter what else you're saying,
10% of your brain is going.

2780
01:52:25,511 --> 01:52:27,460
Holy Shit.
That's Mike Tyson.

2781
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:30,910
When you showed the clip of the 51 year
old Mike Tyson and hitting the bag,

2782
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:35,020
I remember it as a child.
He was the first person I see.

2783
01:52:35,021 --> 01:52:38,350
I have two dads,
I have a non bio on the Bio Dad and I,

2784
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:41,770
he was the first person I had seen in my
life where I say this guy could probably

2785
01:52:41,771 --> 01:52:43,170
beat my dad.
You know,

2786
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:44,440
like everybody else.
You Know My,

2787
01:52:44,470 --> 01:52:46,850
cause my dad's pretty tough guy,
had been a policeman,

2788
01:52:46,851 --> 01:52:48,860
was pretty good with his hands.
My bio day.

2789
01:52:48,861 --> 01:52:50,750
I mean my non biofire was a six foot
seven,

2790
01:52:50,950 --> 01:52:53,210
you know,
he played offensive tackle on same high

2791
01:52:53,211 --> 01:52:54,080
school teams,
Richard Dick.

2792
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:55,860
So I got some pretty,
you know,

2793
01:52:55,950 --> 01:52:58,070
bad as dad's not there acting tough.
They just,

2794
01:52:58,190 --> 01:53:01,000
you feel protected as a child.
I remember just seeing Mike Tyson,

2795
01:53:01,020 --> 01:53:01,853
just slight,

2796
01:53:02,230 --> 01:53:03,410
whoa.
It's got,

2797
01:53:03,420 --> 01:53:05,070
could probably fucking kill everything

2798
01:53:06,470 --> 01:53:10,170
you say.
He hit with such vicious and evil

2799
01:53:10,171 --> 01:53:11,610
intent.
It was amazing.

2800
01:53:11,970 --> 01:53:13,260
He could still do it.
Yeah.

2801
01:53:13,261 --> 01:53:15,270
So when I saw him,
he was hitting the bag like he's still

2802
01:53:15,271 --> 01:53:16,130
terrifying.
Yeah.

2803
01:53:16,250 --> 01:53:18,390
If he was a young contender coming up,
you would look at him and go,

2804
01:53:18,391 --> 01:53:19,410
wow,
this guy can punch.

2805
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:21,660
Yeah.
He doesn't have nearly the hand speed

2806
01:53:21,661 --> 01:53:24,120
that he had when he was young.
Look at that man.

2807
01:53:24,210 --> 01:53:25,950
Yeah,
that was the peak.

2808
01:53:27,690 --> 01:53:29,140
He is an amazing story though,
man.

2809
01:53:29,210 --> 01:53:33,970
Listening to him describe his childhood
and how custom motto had hypnotized him.

2810
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,160
Yeah,
that was amazing because I'd never heard

2811
01:53:36,161 --> 01:53:38,980
him talk about that before and that's
what people need to understand.

2812
01:53:38,981 --> 01:53:41,440
Like who he was.
He people want to say,

2813
01:53:41,470 --> 01:53:44,800
oh he was,
he was hyper aggressive and he did

2814
01:53:44,801 --> 01:53:46,960
terrible things and he was violent in
this.

2815
01:53:47,410 --> 01:53:51,250
Think of how this kid grew up.
How's it forfeit?

2816
01:53:51,610 --> 01:53:54,400
Yes.
Literally or taken in by this one guy,

2817
01:53:54,401 --> 01:53:57,430
the first time in his life where
anything is positive and it's all about

2818
01:53:57,431 --> 01:54:00,580
fighting and being a destroyer.
And he gets hypnotized by this guy to be

2819
01:54:00,581 --> 01:54:03,100
a destroyer and he's a physical
specimen.

2820
01:54:03,130 --> 01:54:04,650
He really is.
You put your hand,

2821
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:06,880
you grab his,
just his hand,

2822
01:54:06,881 --> 01:54:11,080
like his whole body's like carved out
above a large block of rock.

2823
01:54:11,350 --> 01:54:12,550
He's a tank of a man.

2824
01:54:12,580 --> 01:54:13,061
Wow.
You know,

2825
01:54:13,061 --> 01:54:16,780
still to this day he's a tank and when
he was young,

2826
01:54:16,810 --> 01:54:19,540
they saw that right away,
Teddy Alison on this podcast that when

2827
01:54:19,541 --> 01:54:24,541
Mike was 1,390 pounds and they didn't
believe he was 13 they thought we were

2828
01:54:24,791 --> 01:54:25,930
sandbagging.
They they,

2829
01:54:26,030 --> 01:54:27,880
they put them in at 16 he's like,
yeah,

2830
01:54:27,881 --> 01:54:30,790
okay,
say 16 nobody would believe he's 13 and

2831
01:54:30,791 --> 01:54:32,880
they would come on,
you're shutting these fucking kids.

2832
01:54:33,100 --> 01:54:35,410
They did want to believe it and he just
let him have it.

2833
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:36,221
Okay,
okay.

2834
01:54:36,221 --> 01:54:37,750
You don't have to,
but because he said people were always

2835
01:54:37,751 --> 01:54:40,330
lying about how many fights people had,
they would always say,

2836
01:54:40,331 --> 01:54:42,400
he's only had 10 fights,
and you see the guy move immediately.

2837
01:54:42,401 --> 01:54:42,941
I'm like,
Oh my God,

2838
01:54:42,941 --> 01:54:46,840
this guy's at 50 fights watching him.
And Teddy was saying that that was

2839
01:54:46,841 --> 01:54:48,850
always the hustle,
that everybody always lied a little bit

2840
01:54:48,851 --> 01:54:53,851
about someone's record and when they saw
Mike Tyson at 13 wait 190 pounds just

2841
01:54:55,060 --> 01:54:56,410
fucking specimen.

2842
01:54:56,990 --> 01:55:00,580
There's some people that are just built
perfect for certain things.

2843
01:55:01,470 --> 01:55:06,470
He was built to be this perfect for
bobbing and weaving and tight and he was

2844
01:55:06,551 --> 01:55:11,330
so fucking fast.
His Hook and uppercut boldness,

2845
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:15,040
I,
what's fighter has that upper cut like

2846
01:55:15,041 --> 01:55:16,960
the likes.
Louis had a tremendous upper cut,

2847
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:17,680
eh?
Yeah,

2848
01:55:17,680 --> 01:55:18,880
there's,
there's some fighters today.

2849
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:21,580
Joshua was a tremendous upper ha
uppercut.

2850
01:55:22,270 --> 01:55:22,931
Yeah,
there's some,

2851
01:55:22,931 --> 01:55:23,950
there's some,
you know,

2852
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:29,050
amazing talent today,
but it's like what Mike had done was

2853
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:34,440
revitalize the entire country's image of
the heavyweight division because

2854
01:55:34,680 --> 01:55:38,140
characters and got mad at me for a while
and no disrespect,

2855
01:55:38,141 --> 01:55:41,350
but there was guys that just like pink
Olan Thomas who's a champion and Tony

2856
01:55:41,351 --> 01:55:43,860
tubs.
They weren't the kind of guy that you

2857
01:55:43,861 --> 01:55:44,100
like

2858
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:45,960
look forward to seeing as being the
champion of the world.

2859
01:55:45,961 --> 01:55:46,830
You didn't believe it.
You're like,

2860
01:55:46,831 --> 01:55:48,450
I don't believe that's the toughest guy
in the world.

2861
01:55:48,690 --> 01:55:50,580
It might be a tough guy.
I'm sure he's a tough guy.

2862
01:55:50,581 --> 01:55:52,740
He's a professional boxer,
but I don't think that's the best guy.

2863
01:55:53,010 --> 01:55:56,460
And then Tyson came along very is
perfect name.

2864
01:55:56,461 --> 01:55:58,230
He had the perfect look.
He had the perfect body,

2865
01:55:58,231 --> 01:56:00,720
the perfect image,
and he came at the perfect time.

2866
01:56:00,740 --> 01:56:01,500
Yup.
Mike,

2867
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:04,800
when you look at hip hop and where it
was and where Mike was at the time,

2868
01:56:05,070 --> 01:56:08,010
it was a perfect synergy for him to
become a hero.

2869
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:10,080
Mike Tyson,
Mike Jordan,

2870
01:56:10,081 --> 01:56:14,610
like these people became icon.
It's at a time where the United States,

2871
01:56:14,940 --> 01:56:19,770
like in the 80s after getting opaque
kicking ass and the debt crisis fucking

2872
01:56:19,771 --> 01:56:24,030
up the 70s our ranch shit at the end of
the seventies early eighties I steal.

2873
01:56:24,040 --> 01:56:25,800
I remember my grandfather worked at hall
steel,

2874
01:56:25,801 --> 01:56:29,580
remember steal my other grandfather
steel leaving America.

2875
01:56:29,580 --> 01:56:34,580
I remember like it just kind of being
like it wasn't as proud and he was one

2876
01:56:35,641 --> 01:56:40,641
of those things that may you feel bad
ass and the Times feel dangerous and he

2877
01:56:41,251 --> 01:56:44,440
was black and those little boxes and you
didn't wear the boots.

2878
01:56:44,470 --> 01:56:48,210
He wasn't flashy.
Like he was a perfect villain at a time

2879
01:56:48,211 --> 01:56:51,750
where Villainy Nwa,
you know what I'm saying was was

2880
01:56:51,751 --> 01:56:55,380
celebrated danger.
I think he was perfect for the time and

2881
01:56:55,381 --> 01:56:58,860
I think he's perfectly now like what
Mike is when I hear him interview and I

2882
01:56:58,861 --> 01:57:01,080
really talk and people make fun of his
list,

2883
01:57:01,081 --> 01:57:03,660
but whatever.
And I think that gets in the way of you

2884
01:57:03,661 --> 01:57:06,150
hearing the real wisdom.
He's saying a lot of times,

2885
01:57:06,540 --> 01:57:11,040
like Mike is repeatedly talked about
change and about growth and about how he

2886
01:57:11,041 --> 01:57:14,280
doesn't see things the same.
And I think if we actually listened to

2887
01:57:14,281 --> 01:57:16,620
that,
it kind of challenged us to do the same

2888
01:57:16,621 --> 01:57:18,540
shit that we really don't want to do.

2889
01:57:18,570 --> 01:57:18,991
Yeah.
He's a,

2890
01:57:18,991 --> 01:57:22,440
one of the rare guys that you'll talk to
that accomplished an insane amount,

2891
01:57:22,441 --> 01:57:26,340
literally became one of the most famous
boxers in the history of the sport.

2892
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:30,270
And you talk about him now and all he
wants to do is dismiss that past life.

2893
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:32,050
He went to,
he like I was,

2894
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:33,210
I was silly.
Look,

2895
01:57:33,390 --> 01:57:34,680
look at me.
I'm a silly person.

2896
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:36,690
He's a real warrior.
Like he's,

2897
01:57:36,691 --> 01:57:37,530
he's,
he's,

2898
01:57:38,210 --> 01:57:40,120
he is like in a class that come
fulfilled.

2899
01:57:40,230 --> 01:57:42,600
He's the reluctant teacher almost.
You know,

2900
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:43,441
he's,
you know,

2901
01:57:43,441 --> 01:57:44,430
you do,
you do,

2902
01:57:44,870 --> 01:57:45,541
you,
you know,

2903
01:57:45,541 --> 01:57:46,890
you do a,
you do a movie.

2904
01:57:46,891 --> 01:57:50,650
Mike is the guy who used a student go to
beg to teach you to fight and you want

2905
01:57:50,690 --> 01:57:52,380
one.
You want to know why he won't teach you

2906
01:57:52,381 --> 01:57:54,000
in.
It's because you find out later your

2907
01:57:54,001 --> 01:57:55,170
teacher killed someone,
you know,

2908
01:57:55,171 --> 01:57:58,260
in the ring or some shit like he is,
he is really that character.

2909
01:57:58,260 --> 01:57:59,730
He is a,
he's,

2910
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:04,560
you can tell even with the pigeons back
in the days that there's kindness and

2911
01:58:04,561 --> 01:58:09,330
love in there somewhere and now he gets
to express it to human beings.

2912
01:58:09,630 --> 01:58:11,880
You just see he's a happier person.
You know what I mean?

2913
01:58:11,970 --> 01:58:13,750
Until you bring up don king's name.
Yeah.

2914
01:58:13,910 --> 01:58:14,760
Don't do that.
Yeah.

2915
01:58:14,761 --> 01:58:16,110
And then,
then you get scared.

2916
01:58:16,111 --> 01:58:18,330
Like he's going to fucking beat me up.
And my dad too.

2917
01:58:19,030 --> 01:58:21,510
He,
the crazy thing about him selling weed

2918
01:58:21,511 --> 01:58:24,170
now is that he,
they chart,

2919
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:27,240
what did they charge him?
$300,000 I think for he tested positive

2920
01:58:27,450 --> 01:58:32,340
for the Andrew Gelada fight for weed.
So they find him $300,000 they just

2921
01:58:32,341 --> 01:58:34,620
stole money from him cause he had weed
in the system.

2922
01:58:34,650 --> 01:58:36,780
Wow.
Now he sells weed.

2923
01:58:38,660 --> 01:58:42,010
Ain't going to nfl guys.
So should let everybody smoke

2924
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:43,630
it.
It's good for your brain if you're,

2925
01:58:43,631 --> 01:58:45,400
if you're,
especially if you're doing something

2926
01:58:45,401 --> 01:58:47,770
like slamming into each other,
running 30 miles an hour.

2927
01:58:47,790 --> 01:58:50,290
Yeah.
It's probably good to give them

2928
01:58:50,291 --> 01:58:54,670
something to calm them down or release
some of the inflammation.

2929
01:58:55,930 --> 01:58:56,763
The,
I mean,

2930
01:58:56,770 --> 01:58:59,170
grown adults telling you you can or
can't do it.

2931
01:58:59,171 --> 01:59:01,930
It's just what's ridiculous about it.
The end of the day,

2932
01:59:02,110 --> 01:59:05,500
a grown adult telling you they can't.
The ones who say you shouldn't smoke

2933
01:59:05,501 --> 01:59:06,730
weed.
They don't do it.

2934
01:59:07,260 --> 01:59:09,490
They don't know what they're talking.
Haven't ever done it.

2935
01:59:09,700 --> 01:59:12,040
The ones who do or don't,
or the ones who have and like,

2936
01:59:12,041 --> 01:59:13,660
I don't do it anymore.
I don't like to get high anymore.

2937
01:59:13,780 --> 01:59:14,471
Those guys,
you're like,

2938
01:59:14,471 --> 01:59:14,831
oh,
okay.

2939
01:59:14,831 --> 01:59:16,540
I get it.
Used to you don't like to do it.

2940
01:59:16,660 --> 01:59:18,190
Fucks with your productivity,
whatever.

2941
01:59:18,191 --> 01:59:20,190
I get it,
but if you never done it and you're

2942
01:59:20,191 --> 01:59:22,420
talking shit about it,
you don't even know the benefits.

2943
01:59:22,510 --> 01:59:23,770
You really just want to be like,
shut up.

2944
01:59:23,950 --> 01:59:26,770
There's benefits to it.
There's definitely some people get

2945
01:59:26,771 --> 01:59:31,390
fucked up by everything,
whether it's weed or alcohol or speed.

2946
01:59:31,480 --> 01:59:33,190
People get fucked up.
Some people just fucked up.

2947
01:59:33,191 --> 01:59:34,300
I been a drill,
yes,

2948
01:59:34,330 --> 01:59:36,880
but I can,
I can honestly tell you that I read an

2949
01:59:36,881 --> 01:59:41,881
article in huff or something years ago
that talked about parents who smoked and

2950
01:59:42,740 --> 01:59:45,090
stoners actually being more engaged with
their children.

2951
01:59:45,091 --> 01:59:47,830
So that doesn't mean you get up and you
get fried the first thing in the

2952
01:59:47,831 --> 01:59:49,120
morning,
you take your kid to school,

2953
01:59:49,390 --> 01:59:54,390
but it does mean that were drinkers or
smokers would come home and almost avoid

2954
01:59:54,520 --> 01:59:58,390
the child to smoke or drink or do
something else or had other things going

2955
01:59:58,391 --> 02:00:01,060
on.
Stoner with literally pop up may take a

2956
02:00:01,061 --> 02:00:04,660
hit or two of the joint and the focus
would be more on just being the child

2957
02:00:04,661 --> 02:00:05,680
parenting,
kind of kicking it,

2958
02:00:05,681 --> 02:00:06,514
cooling it.

2959
02:00:06,790 --> 02:00:08,500
Yeah.
You're way more curious when you're

2960
02:00:08,501 --> 02:00:10,660
high.
So if you're just a little bit high and

2961
02:00:10,661 --> 02:00:11,980
you're around kids,
you're,

2962
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:15,610
you would be thinking more the way
they're thinking or trying to be a

2963
02:00:15,611 --> 02:00:17,530
little calmer with them and a little bit
more,

2964
02:00:18,130 --> 02:00:21,730
a little bit more patient.
It makes you more relaxed person.

2965
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:24,470
Absolutely.
Because the anxiety is given to you.

2966
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:29,350
She asked out the shower writing to God
was shook one that's talked about and he

2967
02:00:29,351 --> 02:00:31,160
talked very openly about anxiety in
that.

2968
02:00:31,170 --> 02:00:31,871
And he's wanting,
yeah,

2969
02:00:31,871 --> 02:00:34,270
these are the people I like to see you
bring up too is a great,

2970
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:36,730
I got that on tape too.
I got that one in audio.

2971
02:00:36,731 --> 02:00:38,200
It's not as it was listened to it.
I was running.

2972
02:00:38,230 --> 02:00:39,700
Yeah.
Like man there who cause he,

2973
02:00:39,730 --> 02:00:40,570
he reads it.
Yeah.

2974
02:00:40,571 --> 02:00:43,000
We don't acknowledge that.
Like in the African American community

2975
02:00:43,001 --> 02:00:45,280
kidney disease,
it's something that plays and not just

2976
02:00:45,281 --> 02:00:50,140
diet carrying around stress and all that
anxiety is bad for your kidneys.

2977
02:00:50,140 --> 02:00:51,360
They,
that's where you're fearing stressed

2978
02:00:51,370 --> 02:00:53,230
beats up the most.
Yeah.

2979
02:00:53,290 --> 02:00:54,110
I think,
uh,

2980
02:00:54,110 --> 02:00:56,920
it's very important for all of us to be
honest about how we feel.

2981
02:00:56,980 --> 02:00:58,720
It doesn't make you weak.
It just makes,

2982
02:00:58,780 --> 02:01:02,950
it makes you brave enough to be able to
express honestly what everybody is

2983
02:01:02,951 --> 02:01:05,080
probably feeling.
But it scared to bring up cause they

2984
02:01:05,081 --> 02:01:06,480
don't want to be thought of as weak.
Yeah.

2985
02:01:06,580 --> 02:01:08,100
They don't want to be a whiny bitch.
Yeah.

2986
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:10,000
So I didn't want to tell you what's
going on that's wrong.

2987
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:12,820
But especially something like anxiety,
man did the,

2988
02:01:12,821 --> 02:01:16,600
the delicate balance of chemicals that
exist in the human mind and how much it

2989
02:01:16,601 --> 02:01:19,660
can be affected by stress and
relationships and life in general and

2990
02:01:19,870 --> 02:01:23,950
your diet and all these other factors
and then there's genetic issues and

2991
02:01:23,951 --> 02:01:26,200
some,
some people just have problems.

2992
02:01:26,250 --> 02:01:29,090
Yeah,
a wound tight and you can get help if

2993
02:01:29,170 --> 02:01:29,840
you can get help.

2994
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:33,490
I'll get help through cognitive therapy.
You can get help through medication.

2995
02:01:33,491 --> 02:01:36,460
There's a lot of people that believe
that ecstasy should help people,

2996
02:01:36,550 --> 02:01:39,800
that they should be able to do MTMA
therapy for a lot people with stress.

2997
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:42,620
It's a lot of talk of that now and now.
That thing,

2998
02:01:42,650 --> 02:01:45,320
your body,
you making the decision on what to put

2999
02:01:45,321 --> 02:01:46,280
in it.
Yes.

3000
02:01:46,340 --> 02:01:50,000
It's more in line with right than wrong.
Well especially if there's science

3001
02:01:50,001 --> 02:01:50,870
behind it.
Yeah,

3002
02:01:51,050 --> 02:01:53,270
like if they,
if they allowed it to be legal,

3003
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:55,760
then you would,
you would allow it to be regulated,

3004
02:01:55,761 --> 02:01:58,970
which means you would allow it to be
like you would know exactly how many

3005
02:01:58,971 --> 02:02:01,910
milligrams of this is in this and how
much you should take.

3006
02:02:01,911 --> 02:02:05,480
If you weigh 112 pounds versus you weigh
212 pounds,

3007
02:02:05,910 --> 02:02:08,460
that all those things should be taken in
consideration by science.

3008
02:02:09,220 --> 02:02:11,450
And if we had that,
if we just had freedom,

3009
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:12,440
I can see that.

3010
02:02:12,440 --> 02:02:14,380
Yeah.
I think they're hub,

3011
02:02:14,450 --> 02:02:18,840
they're having a lot of studies are a
lot of success rather with um,

3012
02:02:18,950 --> 02:02:22,400
veterans and treating veterans with MDA
and maps,

3013
02:02:22,700 --> 02:02:24,740
you know,
maps the psychedelic organization,

3014
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:28,670
no heard of them.
They're an organization that is working

3015
02:02:28,671 --> 02:02:31,640
to try to um,
make psychedelics legal.

3016
02:02:32,270 --> 02:02:34,220
And uh,
one of the things that are pushing

3017
02:02:34,250 --> 02:02:38,390
initially is this mtma study that
they've done with veterans and they're

3018
02:02:38,391 --> 02:02:43,391
showing a significant benefit and
reduction of PTSD and stress from

3019
02:02:43,610 --> 02:02:45,770
veterans to come home.
And they've seen a lot of shit over

3020
02:02:45,771 --> 02:02:47,420
there and they're just,
you know,

3021
02:02:47,450 --> 02:02:50,270
fucked up from it.
And it seems to be one of the best

3022
02:02:50,271 --> 02:02:53,510
things I've ever found and discovered
for alleviating.

3023
02:02:53,511 --> 02:02:55,490
The other thing that they've used it on
is a,

3024
02:02:55,491 --> 02:02:58,460
I think John Hopkins had one they did
with Siliciden,

3025
02:02:58,490 --> 02:03:01,100
same sort of result,
give people psychedelics under

3026
02:03:01,101 --> 02:03:06,101
controlled situations and they have a
big alleviation of stress from the past.

3027
02:03:06,290 --> 02:03:09,380
They can let things go.
I got introduced to mushrooms.

3028
02:03:09,610 --> 02:03:10,443
Oh Wow.
Okay.

3029
02:03:10,470 --> 02:03:11,660
As Dj.
So if,

3030
02:03:11,661 --> 02:03:15,230
and that was a beautiful experience.
I introduced my wife to him because of

3031
02:03:15,231 --> 02:03:16,900
that,
so I can,

3032
02:03:16,940 --> 02:03:18,260
I can definitely see that.
Yeah.

3033
02:03:18,261 --> 02:03:19,730
There's something to them.
Yeah,

3034
02:03:19,731 --> 02:03:22,490
for sure.
There is me and l do me and l enjoy

3035
02:03:22,491 --> 02:03:24,710
mushrooms while we make music?
Do you really?

3036
02:03:24,740 --> 02:03:25,431
Yeah.
Mushrooms.

3037
02:03:25,431 --> 02:03:27,230
We and whiskeys.
He and drink whiskey,

3038
02:03:27,231 --> 02:03:30,040
drink some Tequila or what do you call
the others?

3039
02:03:30,041 --> 02:03:31,970
Tequila and mezcal is it?
Yeah.

3040
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:32,331
Yeah.
He,

3041
02:03:32,331 --> 02:03:36,140
he drinks a mass cal.
I drink whiskey and shrooms in a week,

3042
02:03:36,290 --> 02:03:39,620
but usually we had drunk ants in here
from yesterday.

3043
02:03:39,650 --> 02:03:43,580
Apparently Richard Rawlings brought this
cinnamon Tequila and some of it had

3044
02:03:43,581 --> 02:03:46,910
spilled on the table and the answered
found it pop up everywhere,

3045
02:03:46,911 --> 02:03:49,070
brushing them along.
They were everywhere.

3046
02:03:49,250 --> 02:03:51,270
They were drunk,
they were just drinking Tequila and it

3047
02:03:51,271 --> 02:03:52,760
was just all giant line of,
I'm like,

3048
02:03:52,761 --> 02:03:55,810
they found the fucking bar in the middle
of space and got added.

3049
02:03:55,850 --> 02:03:57,530
Yeah,
they found it and when we got here it

3050
02:03:57,531 --> 02:03:59,120
was covered with ants,
shrunk aunts.

3051
02:03:59,150 --> 02:04:02,240
My wife made me hang out at a bar all
night last night with her and her

3052
02:04:02,241 --> 02:04:04,910
friend.
They got shit faced drunk,

3053
02:04:04,911 --> 02:04:06,260
threw up in an uber.
Nice.

3054
02:04:06,340 --> 02:04:09,350
Run it through the hallway in our
underwear back at the hotel.

3055
02:04:09,410 --> 02:04:12,320
That sounds like good night.
Throwing up an uber,

3056
02:04:12,620 --> 02:04:14,840
like how many times does that happen to
those poor bastards?

3057
02:04:15,330 --> 02:04:18,770
I forever,
I tipped the God damn near $100 I was

3058
02:04:18,771 --> 02:04:19,041
like,
when,

3059
02:04:19,041 --> 02:04:19,840
oh sorry.
Row.

3060
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:23,940
You know how much puke a large amount,
not ge,

3061
02:04:23,990 --> 02:04:28,550
but enough to be aggravated because she
had a bag.

3062
02:04:28,640 --> 02:04:31,070
So you know,
you'd think that the bad catches,

3063
02:04:31,071 --> 02:04:33,200
but it wasn't plastic.
You know,

3064
02:04:33,201 --> 02:04:34,040
I thought it it,
it,

3065
02:04:34,100 --> 02:04:36,740
it gave a little leak.
It's hard to get that smell out,

3066
02:04:36,741 --> 02:04:40,260
that smell.
It's caused about 150 bucks to get it

3067
02:04:40,270 --> 02:04:40,750
together.

3068
02:04:40,750 --> 02:04:43,290
Piecemeal out.
Really that shit is in your body.

3069
02:04:43,291 --> 02:04:45,130
Like imagine if you turn yourself inside
out.

3070
02:04:45,290 --> 02:04:49,470
Probably Smell
pubes first far to the morning.

3071
02:04:49,940 --> 02:04:51,540
But puke smelled is something in the
need.

3072
02:04:51,550 --> 02:04:53,550
That's why I don't like Yoga.
Hot Yoga,

3073
02:04:53,551 --> 02:04:56,340
rather regular yoga I can endure.
Why don't you like it?

3074
02:04:56,341 --> 02:04:58,350
Because Yogurt,
no fart.

3075
02:04:59,870 --> 02:05:03,420
Like Yo man moms her farting,
you know,

3076
02:05:03,421 --> 02:05:05,850
straight up you go to hot yoga,
hot yoga.

3077
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:08,220
You ever had a hot chick convince you to
do that shit.

3078
02:05:08,380 --> 02:05:11,070
It's like my wife's side,
so she could talk me in the most dumb

3079
02:05:11,071 --> 02:05:12,150
shit.
Right.

3080
02:05:12,151 --> 02:05:12,691
So all,
yeah,

3081
02:05:12,691 --> 02:05:14,580
we're going to fucking hot yoga.
Yeah.

3082
02:05:14,581 --> 02:05:16,420
Hi.
Mavs tits acids.

3083
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:18,930
Yo,
this shit you gotta block for me to say.

3084
02:05:18,931 --> 02:05:20,130
And then it's like,
Ooh,

3085
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:25,160
pitch to too far.
Yeah.

3086
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:28,050
Like I know my wife are,
that's not my wife Fart.

3087
02:05:29,190 --> 02:05:30,240
And then you say fuck it.

3088
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:32,310
You start farting.
Oh No.

3089
02:05:32,340 --> 02:05:33,250
Yeah.
Like then,

3090
02:05:33,290 --> 02:05:35,530
and you know that shit.
Yeah.

3091
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:36,271
Yeah.
So I don't,

3092
02:05:36,271 --> 02:05:37,680
I don't fuck with hot yoga.
I,

3093
02:05:37,780 --> 02:05:41,430
I'd rather just do regular yoga and then
just sign of that shit out.

3094
02:05:41,431 --> 02:05:42,500
Like you,
yeah.

3095
02:05:42,630 --> 02:05:44,040
Um,
I like how yoga

3096
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:47,260
and tell the truth.
I don't,

3097
02:05:47,320 --> 02:05:49,380
I do it fasted.
Okay.

3098
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:51,330
But first thing in the morning,
respect.

3099
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:53,040
No one farts though.
Oh,

3100
02:05:53,041 --> 02:05:56,310
people far for sure.
April fart if you go to the early

3101
02:05:56,311 --> 02:05:57,360
classes.
Okay.

3102
02:05:57,530 --> 02:05:59,860
All right.
So the pros.

3103
02:05:59,910 --> 02:06:01,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

3104
02:06:01,270 --> 02:06:03,210
All right.
This is a couple different places that I

3105
02:06:03,211 --> 02:06:05,510
go to,
but I let go into the early classes.

3106
02:06:05,780 --> 02:06:07,830
Do your side of the same day you hot
yoga?

3107
02:06:07,890 --> 02:06:09,150
Sometimes.
Most of the time,

3108
02:06:09,151 --> 02:06:10,080
no.
Most of the time,

3109
02:06:10,081 --> 02:06:12,390
no double door.
I have,

3110
02:06:12,391 --> 02:06:14,460
if I have an injury,
if I have something that's fucking with

3111
02:06:14,461 --> 02:06:15,630
me,
but uh,

3112
02:06:15,930 --> 02:06:18,270
if I do that,
I almost consider it like a sauna

3113
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:20,010
because you get so God damn hot.

3114
02:06:20,010 --> 02:06:23,790
Like the room might only be 104 degrees,
but when you're working out hard doing

3115
02:06:23,791 --> 02:06:26,250
yoga,
your body is poor and sweat.

3116
02:06:26,580 --> 02:06:30,690
You must be heated up as warm as you get
in a sauna.

3117
02:06:30,720 --> 02:06:32,420
It feels the same way to me.
Gotcha.

3118
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:34,890
It feels like almost like I'm trying to
work out in the sauna.

3119
02:06:34,950 --> 02:06:38,910
Gotcha.
This doing some study now at Harvard

3120
02:06:38,911 --> 02:06:42,480
about it,
about a heat shock proteins and hot

3121
02:06:42,481 --> 02:06:44,820
yoga,
and you know how much inflammation it

3122
02:06:44,821 --> 02:06:48,750
reduces and how beneficial is to you.
I forget what scientists were involved

3123
02:06:48,751 --> 02:06:49,920
in it,
but a bunch of people were talking about

3124
02:06:49,921 --> 02:06:52,350
it the other day.
I know it definitely gets gas at your

3125
02:06:52,351 --> 02:06:54,300
ass.
It definitely does so well.

3126
02:06:54,301 --> 02:06:57,030
If you have something that you shouldn't
beat and like eat a hot dog with

3127
02:06:57,031 --> 02:07:01,080
sauerkraut and a coke and then two hours
later tried to go to yoga class,

3128
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:04,290
you're a criminal,
you're a terrible person.

3129
02:07:06,720 --> 02:07:10,440
Fucking Mofo.
And there's nowhere for that far to go

3130
02:07:10,441 --> 02:07:11,870
either.
It's stuck in the hot day.

3131
02:07:11,910 --> 02:07:12,990
Yeah,
that's the thing.

3132
02:07:12,991 --> 02:07:17,190
It stays there that you get the real
earthy chicks,

3133
02:07:17,191 --> 02:07:21,000
they burn sage and then that starts to
suffocate you and you gotta leave the

3134
02:07:21,001 --> 02:07:22,560
real earthy chicks.
Yeah.

3135
02:07:22,730 --> 02:07:25,740
Do you know sage?
Someone told me this check and see if

3136
02:07:25,741 --> 02:07:27,390
this is right.
I think we might've talked about this

3137
02:07:27,391 --> 02:07:30,360
before.
A Salvia is sage.

3138
02:07:31,710 --> 02:07:35,710
Salvia divinorum someone said is like
the same shit as sage.

3139
02:07:35,770 --> 02:07:36,603
Really?
Yeah.

3140
02:07:37,090 --> 02:07:40,420
Psychedelic Shay and says she uses sage
burning first.

3141
02:07:40,421 --> 02:07:43,180
I couldn't really,
didn't really like the way it smelled.

3142
02:07:43,181 --> 02:07:46,840
And now it's almost addictive.
Like it's a beautiful smell.

3143
02:07:46,900 --> 02:07:48,850
It's a weird smell.
It is weird.

3144
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:53,450
Someone said it's like related to to
Salvia divinorum like there's so close

3145
02:07:53,451 --> 02:07:55,930
he related,
they think that that might've been why

3146
02:07:55,931 --> 02:07:58,930
they call it sage stoned off stage.

3147
02:07:58,930 --> 02:08:01,510
You get a little buzz or something and
they're saying [inaudible] smell.

3148
02:08:01,570 --> 02:08:03,880
I've never really,
I've never caught a sage buzz.

3149
02:08:04,210 --> 02:08:04,911
Yeah,
I mean,

3150
02:08:04,911 --> 02:08:06,790
but it does calm you.
He's like,

3151
02:08:06,791 --> 02:08:08,500
if I,
like if I walk in the room and I smell

3152
02:08:08,501 --> 02:08:11,740
it now,
I instantly feel just like,

3153
02:08:11,860 --> 02:08:13,270
yeah,
the sages,

3154
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:17,560
the common stages.
Official name is Salvia office and

3155
02:08:17,561 --> 02:08:19,450
novelists or something.
So it's a cousin.

3156
02:08:19,480 --> 02:08:22,770
The salvia divinorum sort of like genius
believe is solid.

3157
02:08:22,870 --> 02:08:24,730
We never know if I could say Janice or
Jenice.

3158
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:27,130
I was panic on that one.
I believe it's Chino.

3159
02:08:27,700 --> 02:08:29,290
Uh,
so that's uh,

3160
02:08:29,840 --> 02:08:32,140
I wonder if that's where the name sage
came from.

3161
02:08:32,141 --> 02:08:34,210
Cause the sage is a wide per a wise
person.

3162
02:08:34,590 --> 02:08:37,720
It came from the use of some trippy
plants.

3163
02:08:37,910 --> 02:08:41,050
Could be.
It might be or might just have some

3164
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:44,530
other strange,
what did you find out?

3165
02:08:44,531 --> 02:08:46,510
Like what's the origin of the,
the,

3166
02:08:46,640 --> 02:08:47,830
the word sage.

3167
02:08:48,130 --> 02:08:49,750
Oh,
it's in the mint family.

3168
02:08:49,751 --> 02:08:51,520
So that makes sense.
Why is it called sage?

3169
02:08:51,521 --> 02:08:53,830
Sage was once considered a medicinal
cure.

3170
02:08:53,831 --> 02:08:58,120
All sage is an herb that has a sweet yet
savory flavor.

3171
02:08:58,150 --> 02:09:00,520
Sage botanical.
He known as Salvia efficient.

3172
02:09:00,521 --> 02:09:03,520
Novelis is native to the Mediterranean
regions.

3173
02:09:03,521 --> 02:09:06,520
Sage.
Sage is botanical name comes from the

3174
02:09:06,521 --> 02:09:10,420
Latin word salver,
which means to be saved.

3175
02:09:10,810 --> 02:09:12,580
Ah,
interesting.

3176
02:09:13,870 --> 02:09:18,870
So why do they call it sage then?
So someone calls it Salvia and Salvia,

3177
02:09:19,391 --> 02:09:22,540
whatever the fuck it is.
And then we call it sage.

3178
02:09:22,600 --> 02:09:24,610
Why do we change the name?
It still doesn't,

3179
02:09:25,290 --> 02:09:28,660
doesn't say why we changed the name.
Right.

3180
02:09:28,661 --> 02:09:31,660
The botanical name makes sense.
It comes from the word salver,

3181
02:09:31,661 --> 02:09:32,950
meaning to be saved.
That makes sense.

3182
02:09:33,190 --> 02:09:35,890
But why sage?
You mean like we like an English?

3183
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:38,230
Yeah.
Why don't we say shop at it from however

3184
02:09:38,231 --> 02:09:40,000
they were using it back in the
Mediterranean region.

3185
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,800
Whatever word they use is probably very
close.

3186
02:09:41,830 --> 02:09:43,510
But they always like treat you like
you're stupid.

3187
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:45,910
Like you have to have a botanical name.
Like bitch,

3188
02:09:45,911 --> 02:09:47,980
just tell me the name.
What's the name?

3189
02:09:47,981 --> 02:09:49,930
Why does it have two names?
What is it?

3190
02:09:50,230 --> 02:09:52,540
What is it?
Is it sage or is it foster?

3191
02:09:52,541 --> 02:09:56,120
Mitis eyelid ptosis.
Hominin he sage.

3192
02:09:56,150 --> 02:09:58,420
Definitely easy to say.
It's crazy ass names.

3193
02:09:58,421 --> 02:10:00,430
You guys want to give them at least
scientists.

3194
02:10:00,640 --> 02:10:01,271
They're all like,
look up,

3195
02:10:01,271 --> 02:10:02,010
we'll,
we'll tell you.

3196
02:10:02,010 --> 02:10:04,840
Let me look.
Let you make your own little name for

3197
02:10:04,841 --> 02:10:05,440
it.
There you go.

3198
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:06,610
What do you want?
Little people,

3199
02:10:07,350 --> 02:10:10,240
people that don't understand science it,
let's just call it sage.

3200
02:10:10,241 --> 02:10:11,350
That's right.
Sage.

3201
02:10:11,860 --> 02:10:13,840
You can't pronounce that.
Salvage Salvia.

3202
02:10:13,841 --> 02:10:14,980
Norum cat do it.

3203
02:10:17,620 --> 02:10:20,440
Have you ever experienced that stuff?
Salvia?

3204
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:23,050
No.
That's what that was one of the ones

3205
02:10:23,051 --> 02:10:26,240
that slipped through the 1970s,
uh,

3206
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:29,650
psychedelic Dac data sweeping act that
made a bunch of things illegal,

3207
02:10:29,890 --> 02:10:32,140
including apparently some of the things
they made illegal aren't even

3208
02:10:32,141 --> 02:10:34,010
psychoactive.
They just to make everything illegal,

3209
02:10:34,190 --> 02:10:36,530
but they missed Salvia.
So it used to be able to buy it.

3210
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:40,670
You see have to go to a gas station and
buy Salvia and trip your fucking balls

3211
02:10:40,671 --> 02:10:42,530
or what's,
what's the Salvia trip line?

3212
02:10:42,680 --> 02:10:45,470
It's,
I only did it once and it was really

3213
02:10:45,471 --> 02:10:46,430
weird.
It was like,

3214
02:10:46,670 --> 02:10:51,670
I don't think I did enough because Ari
Shaffir had a entire life he lived for

3215
02:10:52,011 --> 02:10:55,430
three months in one Salvia trip that
took 10 minutes.

3216
02:10:55,431 --> 02:10:57,500
We talked to him about is the craziest
fucking story.

3217
02:10:57,501 --> 02:10:59,960
He had relationships and breakups and
jobs and,

3218
02:11:00,240 --> 02:11:04,640
and he lived a different life and then
woke up on the couch in 10 minutes

3219
02:11:05,060 --> 02:11:05,840
underwater.

3220
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:07,440
Yeah,
he lived underwater,

3221
02:11:07,460 --> 02:11:08,010
right?
Yeah.

3222
02:11:08,010 --> 02:11:08,843
Yeah.
Dude.

3223
02:11:09,770 --> 02:11:14,240
Just wrapping balls on this stuff that
you could buy from the gas station.

3224
02:11:14,450 --> 02:11:16,820
Ssi.
It was Chrism.

3225
02:11:16,870 --> 02:11:19,050
I try,
I try to stay in very dense and to

3226
02:11:19,051 --> 02:11:21,840
cause,
so there are times where I a very

3227
02:11:21,841 --> 02:11:24,030
dissident in the mushrooms kind of take
me on the trip.

3228
02:11:24,031 --> 02:11:25,430
He ride.
Yeah.

3229
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:26,480
But I,
I don't,

3230
02:11:27,020 --> 02:11:28,840
I don't know how far I want to go.
That's a scary,

3231
02:11:28,850 --> 02:11:30,590
there's already right there.
That's him tripping.

3232
02:11:30,591 --> 02:11:32,810
They got it all on video.
Oh Shit.

3233
02:11:33,350 --> 02:11:37,760
Him and this is some stuff that you,
I don't know if it's legal anymore.

3234
02:11:37,761 --> 02:11:40,010
I think they've made it illegal,
but you used to be able to buy it

3235
02:11:40,011 --> 02:11:41,930
virtually anywhere.
Head shops,

3236
02:11:41,931 --> 02:11:44,150
they all,
they all carried it and it's so much

3237
02:11:44,151 --> 02:11:48,700
more potent than weed but yet legal and
has a long history of people using it to

3238
02:11:50,010 --> 02:11:52,020
char repin.

3239
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:53,840
So when I did it,
I didn't get any of that,

3240
02:11:53,870 --> 02:11:57,200
but I did get a third.
I wouldn't want you to be that trip and

3241
02:11:57,210 --> 02:11:58,820
you're a strong guy.
You know your,

3242
02:11:58,821 --> 02:12:00,000
your,
your stocks.

3243
02:12:00,210 --> 02:12:01,011
Yeah.
You don't want it.

3244
02:12:01,011 --> 02:12:04,070
You don't want to have to be the homie
to save the homie from itself and the

3245
02:12:04,071 --> 02:12:06,230
homies to physically fit.
It's like fun.

3246
02:12:06,250 --> 02:12:08,070
Right.
You have Hershel Walker's tripping bad

3247
02:12:09,030 --> 02:12:11,970
mom partial than the other room.
Kit has all names,

3248
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:14,780
you know what I mean?
You call the police [inaudible] who was

3249
02:12:14,781 --> 02:12:17,250
kicking his old ass,
save us,

3250
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:18,410
you know,
send Ronnie Coleman.

3251
02:12:18,470 --> 02:12:21,700
You would literally have to have cost
asides or Ronnie Coleman and they still

3252
02:12:21,720 --> 02:12:23,390
can fucked.
They would still be fuck.

3253
02:12:23,420 --> 02:12:24,840
You'd be fucked.
Yeah.

3254
02:12:25,400 --> 02:12:29,130
I saw myself from like outside my body,
like it,

3255
02:12:29,131 --> 02:12:31,610
like it would pulsate in my body and
outside of my body,

3256
02:12:31,611 --> 02:12:35,510
in my body and outside my body from like
over here looking down at myself.

3257
02:12:35,710 --> 02:12:36,501
Very.
My mom,

3258
02:12:36,501 --> 02:12:39,650
when she had me,
she died on the table for a few seconds.

3259
02:12:39,710 --> 02:12:44,150
Jesus and she said she saw herself.
I wonder what that is cause that's the

3260
02:12:44,151 --> 02:12:47,360
same thing that everybody says.
I mean regardless of your religious

3261
02:12:47,361 --> 02:12:50,180
beliefs,
to stop for a second and try to figure

3262
02:12:50,181 --> 02:12:55,181
out why so many people see themselves
from above their body see themselves

3263
02:12:56,121 --> 02:12:57,620
outside their body.
Like what is that?

3264
02:12:57,650 --> 02:12:58,400
Well,
we know one.

3265
02:12:58,400 --> 02:12:59,600
I mean,
I mean all,

3266
02:12:59,690 --> 02:13:03,180
all people and even science kind of
agree at this point through the body is

3267
02:13:03,181 --> 02:13:06,500
just a vehicle of sorts.
So machine of sorts that whatever energy

3268
02:13:06,501 --> 02:13:09,200
or solve the spirit,
what are people trying to identify this?

3269
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:12,090
It's within it,
but it's,

3270
02:13:12,100 --> 02:13:13,870
it does disconnect out.
Imagine,

3271
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:18,050
I'm hoping that they figured out how to
put myself in a computer before I die.

3272
02:13:18,051 --> 02:13:19,700
I'd like to live a couple hundred more
years.

3273
02:13:19,701 --> 02:13:20,130
Fuck off.

3274
02:13:20,130 --> 02:13:21,740
So what if it sucks though?
Yeah.

3275
02:13:21,741 --> 02:13:24,080
What if I like to try to be alive?
Dude,

3276
02:13:24,380 --> 02:13:25,670
if you're,
if you're in a computer,

3277
02:13:25,671 --> 02:13:26,660
you can't die.
No,

3278
02:13:26,661 --> 02:13:30,110
I'm saying if you're 89 and you're about
to get the fuck outta here,

3279
02:13:30,140 --> 02:13:35,140
you got the opportunity to upload right
into 29 again for the next 29 years.

3280
02:13:35,281 --> 02:13:36,630
Like Yo,
fuck that.

3281
02:13:36,631 --> 02:13:39,010
I might try that before I decided to
click on out of there.

3282
02:13:39,011 --> 02:13:40,320
You know,
I think they're going to be able to

3283
02:13:40,321 --> 02:13:43,860
reverse aging and I think they're going
to be able to do that before they're

3284
02:13:43,861 --> 02:13:46,230
going to figure out a way to get you
into a machine.

3285
02:13:46,530 --> 02:13:48,060
We'll see.
I think the real problem,

3286
02:13:48,061 --> 02:13:50,970
it'd be a guy like trump putting himself
in like a million machines.

3287
02:13:51,410 --> 02:13:53,280
Just not one.
Not One.

3288
02:13:53,281 --> 02:13:57,960
Like someone who has like a Ted Turner
Bankroll says I like about a million

3289
02:13:57,961 --> 02:13:58,890
texts in this town.

3290
02:14:00,320 --> 02:14:01,860
Starts Breeding Ted's.
Yeah,

3291
02:14:01,890 --> 02:14:05,040
but the butthead robot,
but trump ain't got ted money now.

3292
02:14:05,041 --> 02:14:07,200
He might not have it,
but he's got money for a few robots.

3293
02:14:07,201 --> 02:14:07,671
Yeah,
yeah,

3294
02:14:07,671 --> 02:14:08,051
yeah,
no.

3295
02:14:08,051 --> 02:14:09,960
And those monies,
those robots to go out and make more

3296
02:14:09,961 --> 02:14:12,030
money.
Are Robots going to destroy us?

3297
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:15,870
That's a very good question and that's
something that Elon Musk is actually

3298
02:14:15,871 --> 02:14:17,190
scared of.
Really?

3299
02:14:17,220 --> 02:14:19,260
Yeah.
He's a little deval says it's going to

3300
02:14:19,261 --> 02:14:21,570
happen.
He's a very intelligent guy to just,

3301
02:14:21,780 --> 02:14:26,220
besides making a good record,
he talks about us essentially replacing

3302
02:14:26,221 --> 02:14:28,620
each other with robots soon.
It's entirely possible.

3303
02:14:28,980 --> 02:14:31,080
The Way Ilan Musk looks at it is that
he's,

3304
02:14:31,200 --> 02:14:33,900
he was trying to warn people,
but they weren't listening and that

3305
02:14:34,200 --> 02:14:38,430
there's no telling how powerful they
could get once they become sentient,

3306
02:14:38,460 --> 02:14:42,010
once they start taking control of their
own destiny and creating new robots and,

3307
02:14:42,210 --> 02:14:45,660
and just deciding whether or not we live
or die and how they're going to run

3308
02:14:45,661 --> 02:14:46,500
things,
they're essentially,

3309
02:14:46,710 --> 02:14:49,830
they're going to become a life form and
artificial life form that's way fucking

3310
02:14:49,831 --> 02:14:50,550
smarter than us.

3311
02:14:50,550 --> 02:14:51,480
Yeah,
and he's saying,

3312
02:14:51,481 --> 02:14:53,580
do you think it's smart to arm these
things?

3313
02:14:53,880 --> 02:14:55,020
They've seen,
it's smart to make this,

3314
02:14:55,021 --> 02:14:58,350
like he's looking at it in terms of he's
the tip of the spear.

3315
02:14:58,351 --> 02:15:00,350
Right.
And it comes to technology and an

3316
02:15:00,360 --> 02:15:01,950
implementation of it.
I mean,

3317
02:15:01,951 --> 02:15:03,090
think about who this guy is,
right?

3318
02:15:03,150 --> 02:15:06,810
If he's the one who's telling you
everybody's kind of slow the fuck down.

3319
02:15:07,020 --> 02:15:10,410
This is dangerous.
Like you literally might be making a

3320
02:15:10,411 --> 02:15:11,500
terminator movie here.
Yeah.

3321
02:15:11,580 --> 02:15:13,650
He's literally might be making a
terminator movie.

3322
02:15:14,430 --> 02:15:15,900
Yeah,
we have to worry because we,

3323
02:15:15,930 --> 02:15:18,600
when were you were saying that you think
we evolved from monkeys?

3324
02:15:19,140 --> 02:15:21,000
We evolve from some lower thing.
Well,

3325
02:15:21,001 --> 02:15:23,010
the idea is that we got to keep going.
Well,

3326
02:15:23,011 --> 02:15:27,000
if we might hit a biological bottleneck,
and that might be the whole convergence

3327
02:15:27,001 --> 02:15:29,910
of humans and technology,
that might be what it's all about.

3328
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,340
Like biologically this system doesn't
move fast enough,

3329
02:15:32,520 --> 02:15:35,820
but if we can transcend this and move
into some sort of a digital life,

3330
02:15:36,060 --> 02:15:39,660
that life,
we can accelerate all of the innovation,

3331
02:15:39,661 --> 02:15:44,160
all of the improvements in insane
numbers like years traveled through

3332
02:15:44,161 --> 02:15:45,920
time,
change the fucking,

3333
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:50,960
the nature of life itself.
That's going to probably be one of the

3334
02:15:51,211 --> 02:15:53,340
stages of our future.
Whether it's a thousand years from now

3335
02:15:53,341 --> 02:15:56,250
or a hundred thousand years from now.
It seems to me like with this adoption

3336
02:15:56,251 --> 02:16:00,630
of science and into our daily lives in
terms of like the technologies that

3337
02:16:00,631 --> 02:16:03,570
we're all addicted to,
phones and tablets and all these

3338
02:16:03,571 --> 02:16:06,110
different things going to say.
He says that we're a Cyborg is already

3339
02:16:06,140 --> 02:16:08,970
your extension.
Niesr this is just a rudimentary way.

3340
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:10,290
Yeah,
he's ready for sure.

3341
02:16:10,291 --> 02:16:12,120
Right.
You already living people already living

3342
02:16:12,121 --> 02:16:12,954
through this.
Yeah,

3343
02:16:13,270 --> 02:16:15,060
yeah.
Yeah and he's also coming out with

3344
02:16:15,061 --> 02:16:16,500
something called neuro link.

3345
02:16:16,530 --> 02:16:19,020
I don't exactly know what it was.
He was very vague about it,

3346
02:16:19,230 --> 02:16:22,230
but he was saying he was going to change
the bandwidth to change your,

3347
02:16:22,231 --> 02:16:26,190
your like your ability to access
information and people are going to wear

3348
02:16:26,191 --> 02:16:28,050
it.
You know where this thing on your head,

3349
02:16:28,260 --> 02:16:30,220
it's going to literally charge up your
fucking brain.

3350
02:16:30,221 --> 02:16:32,620
Some strange,
strange days because he couldn't,

3351
02:16:32,650 --> 02:16:35,170
he couldn't explain too much about it,
but he was saying it was going to come

3352
02:16:35,171 --> 02:16:36,220
out in a few months.
I'm like,

3353
02:16:36,221 --> 02:16:37,930
what?
No fuck man.

3354
02:16:39,210 --> 02:16:40,720
Were we were,
you know,

3355
02:16:40,990 --> 02:16:44,140
30 or 40 years away from being
unrecognizable.

3356
02:16:44,260 --> 02:16:47,830
That's what I think.
I think we're 30 or 40 years away from

3357
02:16:47,831 --> 02:16:51,940
being a living in la at the time,
living in a virtual world,

3358
02:16:51,941 --> 02:16:54,220
half the time,
live in an augmented world.

3359
02:16:54,430 --> 02:16:58,180
I think people are going to exist in
these weird worlds where it feels real

3360
02:16:58,181 --> 02:16:59,014
and isn't.

3361
02:16:59,410 --> 02:17:02,080
I think they're going to come out with
programs that are fun at first,

3362
02:17:02,081 --> 02:17:06,250
but then become life consuming where you
put on these fucking goggles and this

3363
02:17:06,400 --> 02:17:09,740
suit and you go into this world and you
live with these people in it and

3364
02:17:09,741 --> 02:17:10,990
interact.
We touch each other,

3365
02:17:11,080 --> 02:17:14,140
but no one's there physically,
but you feel like you are and it's

3366
02:17:14,141 --> 02:17:16,420
magical.
You're like you're living in Avatar,

3367
02:17:16,510 --> 02:17:18,790
you're on Pandora.
You're hanging out with the blue people.

3368
02:17:18,820 --> 02:17:19,231
Gotcha.
Yeah.

3369
02:17:19,231 --> 02:17:21,040
You with the Navi,
that shit could happen.

3370
02:17:21,250 --> 02:17:24,490
You could literally get to a point where
you believe you were there or we could

3371
02:17:24,491 --> 02:17:26,320
be there now.
We could be there.

3372
02:17:26,710 --> 02:17:28,270
Yeah.
That's a sneaky,

3373
02:17:28,480 --> 02:17:29,650
sneaky argument.
Right,

3374
02:17:29,950 --> 02:17:31,660
but that that's,
that's the truth of it all.

3375
02:17:31,690 --> 02:17:32,381
It is a truth.
Right?

3376
02:17:32,381 --> 02:17:33,460
It could be there.
We could be there.

3377
02:17:33,461 --> 02:17:35,130
We could be a part of a simulation.
Yeah.

3378
02:17:35,290 --> 02:17:36,670
That's another thing that you learned.
Most sad.

3379
02:17:37,450 --> 02:17:38,350
I'm like,
God damn it.

3380
02:17:38,380 --> 02:17:41,170
You're supposed to say no.
You're supposed to say no.

3381
02:17:41,260 --> 02:17:43,840
It's impossible.
It could all be fake.

3382
02:17:44,410 --> 02:17:45,580
Deja.
Volcker peaches.

3383
02:17:45,581 --> 02:17:46,600
A glitch.
Yeah,

3384
02:17:46,750 --> 02:17:49,140
sure.
So I just try to live like my grandpa's

3385
02:17:49,141 --> 02:17:52,120
age.
She has enjoyed a regular shit as much

3386
02:17:52,121 --> 02:17:53,010
as you can.
You know?

3387
02:17:53,230 --> 02:17:56,350
Maybe I won't upload,
maybe I just don't want to go earlier

3388
02:17:56,351 --> 02:18:00,070
than the fun stops.
But I think that there's a beauty in,

3389
02:18:02,410 --> 02:18:07,270
now that I'm getting older,
I guess I see a beauty in and in the

3390
02:18:07,271 --> 02:18:10,540
life death cycle.
I don't want to die now.

3391
02:18:10,541 --> 02:18:11,740
I don't want to die tomorrow.
You know what?

3392
02:18:11,741 --> 02:18:13,510
I guess what I'm telling myself.
I'm fucking treadmill,

3393
02:18:13,511 --> 02:18:16,930
God dammit.
But my grandparents were always adamant

3394
02:18:16,931 --> 02:18:20,350
about not going an old folks home.
And I used to think it was about they

3395
02:18:20,351 --> 02:18:22,750
didn't want to be treated bad and he
thought we forget about themselves and

3396
02:18:23,050 --> 02:18:26,350
they never want it to stop living.
So my grandmother died in my arms

3397
02:18:26,351 --> 02:18:30,100
walking up a hill to my granddaughter,
took him to her great grand daughters.

3398
02:18:30,100 --> 02:18:35,100
My daughters are pre k graduation and my
grandfather died fishing,

3399
02:18:35,230 --> 02:18:37,720
which was his greatest love and next to
my grandmother.

3400
02:18:37,750 --> 02:18:42,580
You know what I mean?
And they realized that their life never

3401
02:18:42,581 --> 02:18:46,030
stops if they literally died living.
So I guess that's,

3402
02:18:46,031 --> 02:18:48,430
that's,
that's maybe ultimately what the real

3403
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:51,940
thing you should think about is whether
we're in the machine and outside of it,

3404
02:18:52,330 --> 02:18:53,800
you know,
live the best possible life.

3405
02:18:53,801 --> 02:18:56,800
You shouldn't be trying to escape your
life with goggles or even the phone.

3406
02:18:57,120 --> 02:18:58,600
You know,
this shit has to be lived.

3407
02:18:58,930 --> 02:19:01,720
I agree.
Unless this is the goggles.

3408
02:19:01,860 --> 02:19:04,720
Yeah.
Putting goggles on inside the goggles,

3409
02:19:04,721 --> 02:19:06,380
like mirrors looking at mirrors.
Could be,

3410
02:19:06,400 --> 02:19:07,780
and then we figured out who we really
are.

3411
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:08,830
It could be,
could be,

3412
02:19:09,010 --> 02:19:10,840
that would be the ultimate mind.
Fuck.

3413
02:19:10,870 --> 02:19:13,690
If you put on the goggles one day and
you realized you gotta get Outta here,

3414
02:19:13,691 --> 02:19:13,990
man.

3415
02:19:13,990 --> 02:19:15,220
No I do not.
I'm just,

3416
02:19:15,221 --> 02:19:18,130
you made me think of something.
I'm just stoned and I forgot,

3417
02:19:19,150 --> 02:19:21,640
I forgot the fucking name of the
exhibit.

3418
02:19:22,120 --> 02:19:25,060
There's an exhibit at the High Museum.
I'm on the board of the High Museum.

3419
02:19:25,061 --> 02:19:27,070
Right.
And there's an exhibit there about

3420
02:19:27,590 --> 02:19:31,620
artists and it involves debt.
It is the Infinity Mirror.

3421
02:19:31,621 --> 02:19:33,520
His ticket.
So is um,

3422
02:19:33,800 --> 02:19:35,950
Yay your way.
You Sama,

3423
02:19:36,050 --> 02:19:37,100
it's up.
You got it.

3424
02:19:37,150 --> 02:19:39,450
Yeah.
So when you weigh Kusama yeah,

3425
02:19:39,470 --> 02:19:40,041
yeah.
I'm not,

3426
02:19:40,041 --> 02:19:41,430
I'm not good at,
I'm not good at that one.

3427
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:44,180
But in Fidelis,
I'm taking my daughter,

3428
02:19:44,181 --> 02:19:47,120
I'm taking Mikey Mikey's in an 11 year
old.

3429
02:19:47,240 --> 02:19:49,280
Exactly.
And I'm going to,

3430
02:19:49,281 --> 02:19:51,800
I'm going to,
I'm going to probably hit a joint a

3431
02:19:51,801 --> 02:19:56,090
couple times uber down and I'm going to
walk through this museum that she

3432
02:19:56,091 --> 02:19:58,370
usually doesn't like going with me
because people kind of,

3433
02:19:58,610 --> 02:20:02,000
sometimes he'll recognize me and it
bothers her if she's really trying to

3434
02:20:02,001 --> 02:20:03,410
hang out with dad,
you know what I mean?

3435
02:20:03,470 --> 02:20:05,800
But I'm going to get a chance to walk
through there with just me and her kick

3436
02:20:05,801 --> 02:20:08,770
his Solo Dolo and just experience that
with her.

3437
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:11,240
Just that you see the goggles and Gospel
and mirrors on mirrors.

3438
02:20:11,480 --> 02:20:13,440
So I'm looking forward to having like a
Glen Stope.

3439
02:20:13,490 --> 02:20:15,080
That looks amazing.
Yeah.

3440
02:20:15,440 --> 02:20:17,420
Yeah.
Fuck,

3441
02:20:17,450 --> 02:20:19,070
that's incredible.
I'm on the board.

3442
02:20:19,071 --> 02:20:20,510
I mean,
I got asked,

3443
02:20:20,511 --> 02:20:22,370
I'm a rapper.
When was this museum?

3444
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:25,880
This is the high museum in Atlanta.
We have one of the most premium

3445
02:20:26,180 --> 02:20:29,210
beautiful modernist museums in the
country.

3446
02:20:29,270 --> 02:20:30,900
We hit,
it's greatly supported.

3447
02:20:30,910 --> 02:20:32,360
I'm on the board,
our,

3448
02:20:32,660 --> 02:20:34,970
the greater communities.
How do you have the time to do all this

3449
02:20:34,971 --> 02:20:36,290
shit?
You're making me feel lazy.

3450
02:20:37,320 --> 02:20:38,840
How do you,
it's time to do all this man.

3451
02:20:38,841 --> 02:20:40,850
I just,
I stopped doing as much dumb shit.

3452
02:20:40,940 --> 02:20:44,890
Just decided to be a responsible husband
and dad and go to strip club couple of

3453
02:20:44,891 --> 02:20:45,380
times a week.

3454
02:20:45,380 --> 02:20:46,650
Sell every day.
He was sleepy.

3455
02:20:47,060 --> 02:20:47,980
Shouts out to sleep.
You,

3456
02:20:47,990 --> 02:20:52,400
I miss you bro.
But they asked me for high mood for Hamu

3457
02:20:52,401 --> 02:20:54,530
um,
doctors Rahamo Pico and I know what I'm

3458
02:20:54,531 --> 02:20:57,620
saying.
His last name wrong is an artist who my

3459
02:20:57,621 --> 02:21:01,550
wife owns his piece.
He did the rap music cover and my wife

3460
02:21:01,551 --> 02:21:04,760
has a piece on loan to the Carlos Museum
at emory university.

3461
02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:06,690
Um,
he's one of,

3462
02:21:06,710 --> 02:21:10,490
he's just,
he's going to be a basket like artists

3463
02:21:10,520 --> 02:21:13,100
in terms of how he's talked about and
more.

3464
02:21:13,101 --> 02:21:14,810
He's an amazing human being.
An artist.

3465
02:21:15,140 --> 02:21:16,940
We're lucky enough to own some of his
works.

3466
02:21:17,090 --> 02:21:20,030
He's on the board.
And he suggested that me and a guy named

3467
02:21:20,031 --> 02:21:22,600
king and he worked over at interscope be
um,

3468
02:21:22,700 --> 02:21:25,310
Pete Pete brought to,
and they met us and they accept us in

3469
02:21:25,311 --> 02:21:26,144
it.
And I'm like,

3470
02:21:26,330 --> 02:21:29,780
you gotta understand I grew up about
four or five miles from this place.

3471
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:34,480
And for most kids this place was an
impossibility to go to because their

3472
02:21:34,490 --> 02:21:36,230
imagination wouldn't let them do it.
Right.

3473
02:21:36,440 --> 02:21:38,750
So you were in the,
there's a lot of times you have very

3474
02:21:38,751 --> 02:21:42,590
poor or working class areas that are
right next to things that are inspiring,

3475
02:21:42,591 --> 02:21:45,790
but kids are not brave enough to break
to filter and go because they're never

3476
02:21:45,800 --> 02:21:50,800
encouraged to Ted Turner and the high
museum and things like that have always

3477
02:21:50,871 --> 02:21:53,300
made it very accessible.
So when Ted Turner on the praise and the

3478
02:21:53,301 --> 02:21:54,860
hawks,
if you've got b's and a's,

3479
02:21:54,861 --> 02:21:56,540
you got tickets to the game,
right?

3480
02:21:56,630 --> 02:21:59,640
So you could see baseball party reason
baseball died in inner cities.

3481
02:21:59,660 --> 02:22:02,510
This cause the stadium's moved out and
you couldn't see it.

3482
02:22:02,720 --> 02:22:05,300
Right.
The high museum and the Woodridge found

3483
02:22:05,301 --> 02:22:07,760
that woodruff foundation,
which is a coke charity,

3484
02:22:08,060 --> 02:22:12,080
gave me and two other kids a scholarship
to go train on Saturdays to draw and

3485
02:22:12,081 --> 02:22:13,250
paint,
stuff like that.

3486
02:22:13,250 --> 02:22:16,130
So this museum has been in my life since
I was a kid.

3487
02:22:16,131 --> 02:22:19,160
So being asked to get on the board was
just a huge honor.

3488
02:22:19,190 --> 02:22:22,460
And especially having an 11 year old now
that probably is going to want to be an

3489
02:22:22,461 --> 02:22:22,911
artist,
man,

3490
02:22:22,911 --> 02:22:24,980
it makes me the coolest dad in her life.
So yeah.

3491
02:22:25,020 --> 02:22:27,450
Plus like what a thing on the resume.
Yeah.

3492
02:22:28,650 --> 02:22:30,510
You just look so sophisticated.
I know,

3493
02:22:30,511 --> 02:22:33,630
right.
I get to go buy a jacket and slippers.

3494
02:22:34,410 --> 02:22:37,380
One of them jackets with the leather
patches on the elbows.

3495
02:22:37,870 --> 02:22:42,510
Thank one of those scholarly gentleman.
Perhaps even have a pipe and some

3496
02:22:42,511 --> 02:22:43,540
tobacco.
Yeah,

3497
02:22:43,560 --> 02:22:45,660
I got class man.
Yeah,

3498
02:22:45,661 --> 02:22:46,590
man.
For sure.

3499
02:22:46,591 --> 02:22:48,240
That's cool.
That's cool that you're involved in all

3500
02:22:48,241 --> 02:22:49,140
those different things.
Yeah,

3501
02:22:49,530 --> 02:22:51,420
it's very inspiring.
You know,

3502
02:22:51,480 --> 02:22:53,850
you're doing a lot of shit.
You obviously have a mind for it,

3503
02:22:54,420 --> 02:22:55,253
you know,
it's like,

3504
02:22:55,410 --> 02:22:57,510
have you always been entrepreneurial
like that?

3505
02:22:57,510 --> 02:22:58,830
Have you always been?
I never,

3506
02:22:58,860 --> 02:23:03,810
I just didn't want to be poor.
I just put the world treats poor people

3507
02:23:03,811 --> 02:23:05,520
bad.
But I didn't grow up poor.

3508
02:23:05,550 --> 02:23:08,190
I grew up working class.
So you're taught to work,

3509
02:23:08,690 --> 02:23:10,020
that's what you do.
Yeah.

3510
02:23:10,290 --> 02:23:12,090
And I didn't like working.
I knew I was,

3511
02:23:12,180 --> 02:23:15,270
I knew I was lazy by nature,
so he got to figure out.

3512
02:23:15,420 --> 02:23:19,140
But it's cool that you applied that as
well as you still artistic.

3513
02:23:19,340 --> 02:23:20,910
You know,
you're still very creative.

3514
02:23:20,940 --> 02:23:23,190
You know your wraps or get your fucking
flow is great.

3515
02:23:23,220 --> 02:23:24,450
Thank you.
Your wraps are great.

3516
02:23:24,870 --> 02:23:25,591
Eh,
I got,

3517
02:23:25,591 --> 02:23:26,590
I got,
I um,

3518
02:23:26,880 --> 02:23:29,160
if I was a fighter,
I probably your multistyle fighter.

3519
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:32,190
I have,
I have the ability to get on the tracks

3520
02:23:32,191 --> 02:23:34,770
and wrap next to Tia and big boy,
you know,

3521
02:23:34,800 --> 02:23:39,450
next to bumpy and you know,
project pat and next to lp and be

3522
02:23:39,451 --> 02:23:40,530
something totally different.

3523
02:23:40,530 --> 02:23:42,780
Every track.
I've been blessed with some talent,

3524
02:23:42,870 --> 02:23:43,703
you know what I mean?
And um,

3525
02:23:43,890 --> 02:23:45,990
I'm glad that I got with Elle because
Elle is,

3526
02:23:46,310 --> 02:23:48,690
l is like the Freddie Roach of producing
and rapping.

3527
02:23:48,691 --> 02:23:50,610
Right?
He's a great fight coach for me.

3528
02:23:50,640 --> 02:23:52,830
When I first heard his beats,
I was just like,

3529
02:23:52,831 --> 02:23:54,750
no one in the world,
last federal is be sent me.

3530
02:23:54,890 --> 02:23:56,430
Um,
I'm supposed to be rapping over his

3531
02:23:56,431 --> 02:23:58,590
beats.
So he was only supposed to do three

3532
02:23:58,591 --> 02:24:03,591
beats on my first album on rap music.
But I went into a fucking campaign to

3533
02:24:03,631 --> 02:24:06,180
make him do the album.
So I started calling him like,

3534
02:24:06,181 --> 02:24:07,410
this is how we became friends.
Like Yo,

3535
02:24:07,411 --> 02:24:09,460
so you know what man?
The records of toe,

3536
02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:10,830
we got to finish them up.
Yeah.

3537
02:24:10,831 --> 02:24:12,390
Like yeah man,
I'm working on my album.

3538
02:24:12,720 --> 02:24:13,960
Yeah man,
I'm stoked when we,

3539
02:24:13,961 --> 02:24:15,290
I remember I got to get your song for
that.

3540
02:24:15,300 --> 02:24:16,133
Yeah,
you gotta make sure,

3541
02:24:16,410 --> 02:24:18,510
but so what sub domain you need to do
the whole album,

3542
02:24:18,511 --> 02:24:20,190
bro.
I don't have time.

3543
02:24:20,220 --> 02:24:22,020
I can't do it.
I called back a couple of days.

3544
02:24:22,021 --> 02:24:24,480
So you thought about it,
thought about what we talked about.

3545
02:24:24,481 --> 02:24:26,310
We've talked about,
about you doing my whole album,

3546
02:24:26,500 --> 02:24:28,290
you know,
I told you know now you didn't mean that

3547
02:24:28,291 --> 02:24:29,124
Bro.

3548
02:24:30,910 --> 02:24:35,910
We eat
until he finally just to calm the copy

3549
02:24:36,170 --> 02:24:37,830
property called and say here's some more
money.

3550
02:24:37,870 --> 02:24:40,800
He was just like,
Yo bucket and we became friends and man,

3551
02:24:40,801 --> 02:24:43,020
I truly believe that like,
you know,

3552
02:24:43,021 --> 02:24:45,960
he is,
he's my gusto model in terms of being

3553
02:24:45,961 --> 02:24:48,750
able to put me in focus and training
like Freddie Roach,

3554
02:24:49,050 --> 02:24:51,600
how you see Freddie Roach bring things
out of fighters that you know are in

3555
02:24:51,601 --> 02:24:55,020
them but no one knows how to bring out
and l does l does that.

3556
02:24:55,021 --> 02:24:56,130
So the discipline,
you know,

3557
02:24:56,131 --> 02:24:56,600
I,
I've,

3558
02:24:56,600 --> 02:24:57,330
I've,
I've written,

3559
02:24:57,330 --> 02:24:58,620
gotten with him,
it's a great,

3560
02:24:58,621 --> 02:25:00,300
that's the great thing about partnering,
you know,

3561
02:25:00,301 --> 02:25:03,960
your weaknesses or Canada,
you can identify and fix them,

3562
02:25:04,020 --> 02:25:06,080
you know,
because you have someone training there

3563
02:25:06,090 --> 02:25:07,280
which are right there.
Right.

3564
02:25:07,320 --> 02:25:08,920
You feel inspired by your partner.
Absolutely.

3565
02:25:09,300 --> 02:25:10,480
And I love him for it.
Yeah.

3566
02:25:10,570 --> 02:25:14,370
When two people really enjoy each
other's company and benefit from each

3567
02:25:14,371 --> 02:25:16,110
other's presence and get inspired by
each other,

3568
02:25:16,111 --> 02:25:19,050
the to become bigger than just one bus.
One.

3569
02:25:19,080 --> 02:25:20,430
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

3570
02:25:20,580 --> 02:25:21,330
That's why,
you know,

3571
02:25:21,330 --> 02:25:23,070
I make sure when I,
when I'm introduced,

3572
02:25:23,500 --> 02:25:24,090
you know,

3573
02:25:24,090 --> 02:25:26,120
out of a sudden you have shell Rawlins,
people know him,

3574
02:25:26,121 --> 02:25:28,110
Michael Render Kilo Mike.
But I want a place,

3575
02:25:28,120 --> 02:25:28,870
I always say,
you know,

3576
02:25:28,870 --> 02:25:32,340
first and foremost on Michael Render,
cause this is my mom named me killer.

3577
02:25:32,360 --> 02:25:34,960
Mike's a character that I love.
I enjoy playing.

3578
02:25:34,961 --> 02:25:35,940
You know,
and I'm,

3579
02:25:35,941 --> 02:25:37,900
I'm Shay's husband,
want half a run the jewels.

3580
02:25:37,930 --> 02:25:40,270
These things are more than just who I
am.

3581
02:25:40,271 --> 02:25:42,250
They make significant,
you know,

3582
02:25:42,251 --> 02:25:45,070
change in my life if I,
if I live up to the honor in those

3583
02:25:45,071 --> 02:25:46,840
titles and you know,
I'm a better person.

3584
02:25:46,841 --> 02:25:49,600
So Ales,
my relationship is a very important one.

3585
02:25:49,601 --> 02:25:51,850
Second may be only to my wife.
Yeah.

3586
02:25:51,851 --> 02:25:54,760
And your way of discussing this too.
It's a sincere,

3587
02:25:54,761 --> 02:25:58,270
a fun guy and you're,
you're an inspirational guy in terms of

3588
02:25:58,271 --> 02:26:00,100
your work ethic and all the things that
you've achieved.

3589
02:26:00,280 --> 02:26:03,280
When you say things like that and you
talk about your word and you talk about

3590
02:26:03,281 --> 02:26:05,920
who you are,
that's very powerful to young people

3591
02:26:05,921 --> 02:26:06,670
coming up.

3592
02:26:06,670 --> 02:26:09,460
Cause they'll hear that.
They'll hear how smart you are and how

3593
02:26:09,461 --> 02:26:13,480
well read you are and how much you
understand about the business and in

3594
02:26:13,481 --> 02:26:16,690
life in general.
And then they hear how your thought

3595
02:26:16,691 --> 02:26:21,400
process works and it'll help them mature
their own thought process.

3596
02:26:21,760 --> 02:26:24,850
Gravitate towards positive things.
It's very beneficial.

3597
02:26:25,450 --> 02:26:26,111
Thank you,
man.

3598
02:26:26,111 --> 02:26:26,791
I been,
I mean,

3599
02:26:26,791 --> 02:26:31,120
I learned a lot listening to you check,
checking out the guests you bring on.

3600
02:26:31,121 --> 02:26:33,580
Just pick it up from Arizona.
I just believe in picking up whatever

3601
02:26:33,581 --> 02:26:34,840
you can tell.
That's all I'm doing,

3602
02:26:34,841 --> 02:26:35,890
man.
I'm just picking up with,

3603
02:26:35,891 --> 02:26:38,020
uh,
an antenna that spreads it out.

3604
02:26:38,050 --> 02:26:40,030
Yeah.
Do a hell of a job.

3605
02:26:40,390 --> 02:26:41,350
Thank you.
Can you go ahead?

3606
02:26:41,790 --> 02:26:42,820
Weird Gig.
Yeah,

3607
02:26:42,821 --> 02:26:44,590
I know.
But you do like your,

3608
02:26:44,591 --> 02:26:48,640
your main job is making people laugh and
you're fucking side hustle was making,

3609
02:26:48,641 --> 02:26:52,190
keep making people think that's,
that's an amazing side hustle,

3610
02:26:52,320 --> 02:26:53,153
bro.

3611
02:26:53,230 --> 02:26:57,220
It's overwhelming though sometimes.
So sometimes I do so many of them and I

3612
02:26:57,221 --> 02:26:59,470
do some of them on subjects where I'm
not even well read.

3613
02:26:59,620 --> 02:27:01,810
I don't,
I don't exactly know if this guest is

3614
02:27:01,811 --> 02:27:04,570
being honest or if they're,
you know,

3615
02:27:04,590 --> 02:27:05,580
but you're learning,
right?

3616
02:27:05,581 --> 02:27:06,700
Yeah.
But that's how you feel too.

3617
02:27:06,701 --> 02:27:08,880
That's how you,
that's how you counter,

3618
02:27:08,950 --> 02:27:10,690
you fall into shit.
You don't,

3619
02:27:11,320 --> 02:27:13,180
you don't like,
you don't,

3620
02:27:13,720 --> 02:27:16,480
you don't wake up and know.
Yeah,

3621
02:27:16,710 --> 02:27:19,870
you wicked wake up curious and you can
search and you're honest.

3622
02:27:19,900 --> 02:27:22,270
You have an honest and integrity with
your audience where you say,

3623
02:27:22,470 --> 02:27:25,300
I was wrong about this or I've learned
to pick up more of this.

3624
02:27:25,301 --> 02:27:27,130
I think that's what it's really about.
You know what I mean?

3625
02:27:27,370 --> 02:27:30,040
I don't think it's about being right or
knowing all the time.

3626
02:27:30,070 --> 02:27:30,790
You,
you,

3627
02:27:30,790 --> 02:27:35,790
your forum is very dope because it's
conversational and not contrived it,

3628
02:27:36,591 --> 02:27:39,640
it really is me having the ability to
ask.

3629
02:27:39,640 --> 02:27:40,780
We were talking,
you know,

3630
02:27:40,810 --> 02:27:43,810
Google research have these notes.
I don't know if you know,

3631
02:27:43,960 --> 02:27:45,520
well,
of course you don't take correctly.

3632
02:27:45,760 --> 02:27:48,200
Sure.
An amazing comic when an amazing reason

3633
02:27:48,201 --> 02:27:50,920
why we know about the Zapruder film.
It's exactly,

3634
02:27:50,980 --> 02:27:53,380
yeah.
Dick Gregory brought it to Geraldo

3635
02:27:53,380 --> 02:27:56,020
Rivera.
I knew this man his last three years of

3636
02:27:56,021 --> 02:27:56,970
life.
Um,

3637
02:27:57,130 --> 02:27:58,600
first of all,
first meeting him,

3638
02:27:58,601 --> 02:28:02,050
he cursed me and Tia out is though we'd
stolen the tires off his car.

3639
02:28:02,440 --> 02:28:04,060
Right.
Why would he say,

3640
02:28:04,180 --> 02:28:07,690
well me and t I just kinda got on like
too Hokey wrappers that kind of saw

3641
02:28:07,691 --> 02:28:08,650
them.
You know,

3642
02:28:08,651 --> 02:28:09,220
it,
it's,

3643
02:28:09,220 --> 02:28:09,740
you know,
we're,

3644
02:28:09,740 --> 02:28:11,740
we're,
we've embraced the fact that our

3645
02:28:11,741 --> 02:28:14,500
community looks at us as leaders,
right?

3646
02:28:14,560 --> 02:28:17,680
We're not trying to be doctor Caner
Macklin,

3647
02:28:17,890 --> 02:28:21,560
but we're businessmen were rappers.
We have accountability and

3648
02:28:21,561 --> 02:28:22,130
responsibility

3649
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:24,770
in our community.
So we accept some of what comes with

3650
02:28:24,771 --> 02:28:29,060
that and we're willing to do things.
So in considering protesting,

3651
02:28:29,090 --> 02:28:30,530
considering,
you know,

3652
02:28:30,560 --> 02:28:32,690
talking to politicians on the behalf,
tweet it,

3653
02:28:32,870 --> 02:28:36,560
you have to consult with elders.
So we get on the phone with them like,

3654
02:28:36,561 --> 02:28:37,291
you know,
so what,

3655
02:28:37,291 --> 02:28:39,290
what do we do?
Like kids are getting shot.

3656
02:28:39,630 --> 02:28:41,090
How,
what should we be engaged and should we

3657
02:28:41,091 --> 02:28:42,350
wait?
Should we mark it?

3658
02:28:42,480 --> 02:28:43,920
March,
March,

3659
02:28:44,250 --> 02:28:44,821
nick,
nick,

3660
02:28:44,821 --> 02:28:46,320
Nigga,
what the fuck you go mom.

3661
02:28:46,330 --> 02:28:49,110
It's fun.
They don't think it'll be march 50 years

3662
02:28:49,111 --> 02:28:50,050
ago.
You know,

3663
02:28:50,290 --> 02:28:54,780
they don't open a street up.
Let you mark tell you clothe itself and

3664
02:28:54,781 --> 02:28:56,440
then shoot your ass if you,
you

3665
02:28:56,450 --> 02:28:58,730
just like,
oh shit.

3666
02:28:58,760 --> 02:29:02,090
Like I never actually,
I never thought of that.

3667
02:29:02,750 --> 02:29:06,680
And this is more serious than we're
showing up and were angry.

3668
02:29:06,681 --> 02:29:11,681
This is confronting government.
And once government has shane,

3669
02:29:12,231 --> 02:29:16,550
you do something a few times you have to
practice guerrilla warfare or you're

3670
02:29:16,551 --> 02:29:18,290
just doing what the British did that
lost him.

3671
02:29:18,291 --> 02:29:20,390
America,
you're stepping up in a formation,

3672
02:29:20,510 --> 02:29:22,460
shooting your shot,
falling back,

3673
02:29:22,520 --> 02:29:25,010
stepping up for it.
You're just playing a fucking game where

3674
02:29:25,011 --> 02:29:29,150
they're dancing first is doing things
that really disrupted system and things

3675
02:29:29,151 --> 02:29:31,700
that really progress the move.
And I was like,

3676
02:29:31,760 --> 02:29:33,590
Oh shit,
you know,

3677
02:29:33,650 --> 02:29:37,850
this is radically,
this guys is more than just a funny man

3678
02:29:37,851 --> 02:29:40,730
and he's more just think he's really
sacrificing lady that shit down.

3679
02:29:40,731 --> 02:29:42,890
So yeah,
we got cursed out by Dick Gregory tip

3680
02:29:42,891 --> 02:29:45,220
hung up.
Why you didn't call me back later life

3681
02:29:45,230 --> 02:29:46,011
man,
you know like,

3682
02:29:46,011 --> 02:29:48,190
hey my phone messed up,
dog tilt talk.

3683
02:29:48,190 --> 02:29:49,910
Cool.
It's my phone hung up dog.

3684
02:29:49,911 --> 02:29:52,170
I don't know how to say Nigga,
you Haga he say,

3685
02:29:52,210 --> 02:29:53,120
well what'd he say?
Oh,

3686
02:29:55,520 --> 02:29:56,720
you know,
and then,

3687
02:29:56,800 --> 02:29:58,070
but,
but around that,

3688
02:29:58,250 --> 02:30:00,830
you know,
tip and I have have been able to be a

3689
02:30:00,840 --> 02:30:02,930
better benefit to our community,
you know?

3690
02:30:03,110 --> 02:30:05,780
And then when I say our community,
I don't mean some imaginary mythical

3691
02:30:05,781 --> 02:30:07,850
rapper place.
I mean the five,

3692
02:30:07,851 --> 02:30:10,070
10 mile radius we grew up in,
you know,

3693
02:30:10,071 --> 02:30:11,930
we've made some some,
some change.

3694
02:30:11,960 --> 02:30:13,640
You know what I mean?
And for the better,

3695
02:30:13,641 --> 02:30:16,370
we're going to bring some jobs and shit
like that and I think that that's cool.

3696
02:30:16,430 --> 02:30:17,840
You know what I mean?
That's very cool.

3697
02:30:17,841 --> 02:30:19,460
It sounds cool too.
It sounds like your,

3698
02:30:19,461 --> 02:30:22,970
your you,
you think in a very positive,

3699
02:30:22,971 --> 02:30:26,570
in a progressive way of of helping
community in a real sense.

3700
02:30:26,590 --> 02:30:27,890
Yeah.
That's nice to hear man.

3701
02:30:27,920 --> 02:30:28,850
Yeah.
I hope,

3702
02:30:28,880 --> 02:30:30,650
I hope I helped some people for I get
outta here.

3703
02:30:30,830 --> 02:30:32,270
I also young people say,
you know,

3704
02:30:32,380 --> 02:30:34,790
and your music is fun as fuck.
Straight up.

3705
02:30:34,791 --> 02:30:36,620
Kick you in your Dick Punching your face
music.

3706
02:30:36,650 --> 02:30:38,570
It's fun man.
It's really good shit.

3707
02:30:38,571 --> 02:30:40,070
Like you,
I got a great job.

3708
02:30:40,100 --> 02:30:42,810
You know what I mean?
The secondary job of doing the TV show,

3709
02:30:42,830 --> 02:30:44,690
you just go,
but I got a great job.

3710
02:30:44,691 --> 02:30:46,490
You're a great stand up man.
Thank you.

3711
02:30:46,760 --> 02:30:49,250
I mean in the line of like Carlin and
Hicks,

3712
02:30:49,251 --> 02:30:54,251
like you really push buttons and make,
make mother fuckers twitch like Oh shit

3713
02:30:54,620 --> 02:30:56,300
and think and go home.
That's,

3714
02:30:56,360 --> 02:30:57,650
that's rare.
It's easy to do,

3715
02:30:57,800 --> 02:30:59,270
you know,
Kinda Shucky Shit.

3716
02:30:59,271 --> 02:31:00,920
But you,
I like your shit.

3717
02:31:00,950 --> 02:31:02,630
Thanks for,
I appreciate you like my music.

3718
02:31:02,631 --> 02:31:03,201
Thanks man.
Yeah,

3719
02:31:03,201 --> 02:31:04,220
I love your music.
Yeah,

3720
02:31:04,280 --> 02:31:04,960
no,
I appreciate it.

3721
02:31:04,960 --> 02:31:06,920
It's a,
I think we both are in tricky

3722
02:31:06,921 --> 02:31:08,380
businesses.
Yeah.

3723
02:31:08,590 --> 02:31:10,130
I get a lot out of music,
man.

3724
02:31:10,340 --> 02:31:13,100
I get a lot of fun and energy out of
listening to music.

3725
02:31:13,190 --> 02:31:16,280
I don't have any musical talent at all,
but when I hear good music,

3726
02:31:16,281 --> 02:31:17,270
I get excited,
man.

3727
02:31:17,271 --> 02:31:18,230
It fires me up.
Like,

3728
02:31:18,530 --> 02:31:19,140
I mean it's,
I,

3729
02:31:19,140 --> 02:31:20,010
it's one of the most important

3730
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:23,130
things in our culture in terms of like
our ability to generate energy and

3731
02:31:23,131 --> 02:31:24,630
motivation.
It's a vibration.

3732
02:31:24,660 --> 02:31:25,880
Yeah,
it really is.

3733
02:31:26,100 --> 02:31:27,660
I W with me,
man,

3734
02:31:27,690 --> 02:31:32,250
I think you guys are,
I think right now stand up comedy is the

3735
02:31:32,251 --> 02:31:35,760
last vestige of freedom of speech in
this country and you guys are to be

3736
02:31:35,761 --> 02:31:38,610
protected at all costs.
And I think if people don't protect your

3737
02:31:38,611 --> 02:31:40,380
law,
costs is going to be at,

3738
02:31:40,410 --> 02:31:41,370
at the,
at the,

3739
02:31:41,371 --> 02:31:42,061
um,
for the,

3740
02:31:42,061 --> 02:31:45,090
for the worst of us all.
I definitely think there's something to

3741
02:31:45,091 --> 02:31:47,820
that,
that there's very few people that are as

3742
02:31:47,821 --> 02:31:49,870
free with what they're allowed to say.
Uh,

3743
02:31:50,040 --> 02:31:51,600
like standup comedians.
He goes,

3744
02:31:51,601 --> 02:31:54,330
we're saying this crazy shit under the
guise of it being funny.

3745
02:31:54,420 --> 02:31:56,130
Yeah.
So you can get away with saying a lot of

3746
02:31:56,131 --> 02:31:58,710
things that won't be criticized as long
as people laugh at them and you have a

3747
02:31:58,711 --> 02:31:59,460
good point.

3748
02:31:59,460 --> 02:32:01,800
If you're just making the points without
the joke,

3749
02:32:02,040 --> 02:32:03,180
people wouldn't,
they wouldn't,

3750
02:32:03,181 --> 02:32:04,500
they don't want to hear it.
They get mad at you.

3751
02:32:05,310 --> 02:32:07,680
But something about delivering a point
with a joke.

3752
02:32:08,190 --> 02:32:09,870
That's why trigger warning works.
Yeah,

3753
02:32:09,871 --> 02:32:10,990
for sure.
Yeah.

3754
02:32:11,190 --> 02:32:14,730
It's one of the last ways you can
deliver a message that maybe people

3755
02:32:14,731 --> 02:32:17,070
don't agree with,
but if you can make them laugh at some

3756
02:32:17,071 --> 02:32:19,440
shit they don't even really agree with
and the laughing hard,

3757
02:32:19,740 --> 02:32:21,600
they'll see a little bit of your point.
Yeah,

3758
02:32:21,660 --> 02:32:22,740
absolutely.
Absolutely.

3759
02:32:22,840 --> 02:32:24,120
Yeah.
When you,

3760
02:32:24,121 --> 02:32:26,160
uh,
set out to do trigger warning,

3761
02:32:26,700 --> 02:32:27,630
what did,
what was the,

3762
02:32:27,631 --> 02:32:30,450
what was the initial premise and how
much of it did it change until,

3763
02:32:30,460 --> 02:32:32,160
what,
once you got to production and what you

3764
02:32:32,161 --> 02:32:33,950
started filming you,
one of the only people who have asked

3765
02:32:33,960 --> 02:32:34,950
that question.
You can,

3766
02:32:34,980 --> 02:32:39,030
you can do business bro.
Straight up bro.

3767
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:40,270
Oh,
you know,

3768
02:32:40,470 --> 02:32:43,920
yeah.
Brown originally we shot it with fx and

3769
02:32:43,921 --> 02:32:46,590
we over we over did it.
It looked really good,

3770
02:32:46,591 --> 02:32:48,330
but it looked really TV.
Uh,

3771
02:32:48,420 --> 02:32:50,730
and um,
it could have been dealt,

3772
02:32:50,731 --> 02:32:54,360
but it would have been a parity of a
very real thing I was attempting to do.

3773
02:32:54,690 --> 02:32:56,280
And right now I'm talking about crypto.
Nicola,

3774
02:32:56,670 --> 02:32:57,690
what it turned out,

3775
02:32:58,470 --> 02:33:02,220
uh,
turned into at Netflix was a real

3776
02:33:03,090 --> 02:33:03,923
mmm.

3777
02:33:06,360 --> 02:33:09,600
In your face.
Simple and plainly shot

3778
02:33:11,460 --> 02:33:16,460
documentation of the possibilities of
barbershop arguments,

3779
02:33:16,741 --> 02:33:19,140
right?
So in a barbershop argument,

3780
02:33:19,560 --> 02:33:21,660
you get to say,
you know,

3781
02:33:21,661 --> 02:33:25,870
the only thing that separates Alka palm
from Joe Kennedy is Al Capone got caught

3782
02:33:25,871 --> 02:33:28,860
and eventually died in prison and Joe
Kennedy went on to produce precedence,

3783
02:33:28,861 --> 02:33:30,290
but they both had been bootleg.
Or you know,

3784
02:33:30,450 --> 02:33:32,940
people say Shit like there's barbershop
talk and you need,

3785
02:33:32,941 --> 02:33:34,430
you got to go home and be asking
yourself like,

3786
02:33:34,440 --> 02:33:37,740
well well damn,
if Papa Joe did it was a bootlegger.

3787
02:33:37,741 --> 02:33:40,380
Like technically it could have went
fucked up for him and we never would

3788
02:33:40,381 --> 02:33:45,381
have had an American dynasty versus owl
catch Sibley's in shit and it not going

3789
02:33:45,601 --> 02:33:48,660
so well.
But him being the preeminent marketing

3790
02:33:48,661 --> 02:33:52,170
campaign in face of any compound,
like then you want to sell cigars to a

3791
02:33:52,171 --> 02:33:53,004
restaurant,
right?

3792
02:33:53,080 --> 02:33:54,810
So it got it.
I got a chance to say,

3793
02:33:54,811 --> 02:33:55,644
you know,
Shit,

3794
02:33:55,770 --> 02:33:57,990
what if I could do this for my guys?
And again,

3795
02:33:58,260 --> 02:34:02,760
giving it a shot and giving it a try.
I thought of that shit at 15 years old,

3796
02:34:03,180 --> 02:34:06,630
I started trying to figure out how to do
it 10 years ago.

3797
02:34:06,840 --> 02:34:09,570
Daniel and I got it done eight,
nine years later.

3798
02:34:10,050 --> 02:34:11,620
And now you have this.
And,

3799
02:34:11,621 --> 02:34:15,210
and I say that just to say that I read
Brian Koppelman,

3800
02:34:15,211 --> 02:34:17,350
the creator of billions,
um,

3801
02:34:17,590 --> 02:34:18,430
is a brilliant

3802
02:34:18,430 --> 02:34:20,920
writer to me and he's a phrase of friend
also.

3803
02:34:21,190 --> 02:34:24,310
But Brian has been putting up lately
these just encouraging things,

3804
02:34:24,311 --> 02:34:27,610
telling writers to write,
even if your stuff is getting body even

3805
02:34:27,611 --> 02:34:32,020
if you don't think is good to write,
to to push yourself to push the idea

3806
02:34:32,021 --> 02:34:34,750
forward.
And I've been taking a lot of

3807
02:34:34,751 --> 02:34:38,220
inspiration for that because Daniel
Daniel Weinfeld and I wanted a co writer

3808
02:34:38,221 --> 02:34:40,930
who's in cocreators.
Daniel and I have been talking and

3809
02:34:40,931 --> 02:34:44,470
developing this over 10 years now.
I know how to do it,

3810
02:34:44,471 --> 02:34:45,790
how to go in a room,
how to get it,

3811
02:34:45,791 --> 02:34:47,590
you know,
it won't take me 10 years for the next

3812
02:34:47,591 --> 02:34:49,900
one,
but it was worth the struggle,

3813
02:34:49,960 --> 02:34:51,940
you know,
it was worth doing that.

3814
02:34:51,970 --> 02:34:56,200
It was worth tweaking my ideals worth
critiquing my idea to be like the first

3815
02:34:56,201 --> 02:34:57,460
time around like nine.
It's not,

3816
02:34:57,461 --> 02:35:00,790
it's not what it should be because I was
nervous as shit the night before it came

3817
02:35:00,791 --> 02:35:02,860
out about everything in it.

3818
02:35:02,860 --> 02:35:04,010
You know the,
the,

3819
02:35:04,330 --> 02:35:05,920
what scenes were shot,
how did it look,

3820
02:35:05,921 --> 02:35:10,690
the production value and now seeing
people get it and unlike a lot of other

3821
02:35:10,691 --> 02:35:12,850
artists not have to call yourself a
genius.

3822
02:35:12,880 --> 02:35:15,110
Let me tell people,
like every artist thinks is a changes.

3823
02:35:15,610 --> 02:35:18,880
Every comedian thinks they're fucking
Richard Pryor and some part of your

3824
02:35:18,881 --> 02:35:21,400
mind,
you have to think you're great or why I

3825
02:35:21,401 --> 02:35:23,800
do it.
You have to believe there's greatness in

3826
02:35:23,801 --> 02:35:24,460
you.
Right.

3827
02:35:24,460 --> 02:35:27,100
But I never wanted to be the guy.
I'm a fucking genius.

3828
02:35:27,101 --> 02:35:28,720
You know what I mean?
I just never want it.

3829
02:35:28,870 --> 02:35:31,420
But to see it,
because I always thought the idea was

3830
02:35:31,421 --> 02:35:33,220
genius.
Like fuck that shit.

3831
02:35:33,221 --> 02:35:36,250
You remember real people that used to
come on in the seventies eighties I

3832
02:35:36,251 --> 02:35:39,610
remember watching that show as a kid
looking at motherfuckers like,

3833
02:35:39,611 --> 02:35:41,980
wow,
these motherfuckers exist in it,

3834
02:35:41,981 --> 02:35:44,950
in it,
and he's off far off places like Iowa

3835
02:35:44,980 --> 02:35:47,680
and Kansas and I wanted to approach it.

3836
02:35:47,740 --> 02:35:52,420
I want it to approach people in a very,
I'm here right in front of you kind of

3837
02:35:52,421 --> 02:35:53,231
way.
Not Above you,

3838
02:35:53,231 --> 02:35:56,080
not celebrity Michael Morris,
but people normal wrapper.

3839
02:35:56,230 --> 02:35:59,880
And it gave me that opportunity and
people can say is genius and I'm going

3840
02:35:59,881 --> 02:36:02,350
to say I'm humbled and honored,
but you're fucking right.

3841
02:36:02,470 --> 02:36:06,430
And it's genius because I'm engaging
people at a regular human level,

3842
02:36:06,580 --> 02:36:10,150
not at the level of celebrity or power
to used to be an engaged but one it

3843
02:36:10,151 --> 02:36:14,710
allows them to fully open up.
I haven't seen it on TV sets some shit

3844
02:36:14,711 --> 02:36:18,640
like real people or no,
I haven't seen revolutionary tv like the

3845
02:36:18,641 --> 02:36:22,900
Jeffersons or you know,
all in the family or mod and I think

3846
02:36:22,901 --> 02:36:25,780
that the world is getting scary and
pussy to be honest.

3847
02:36:26,020 --> 02:36:26,801
You know,
not to,

3848
02:36:26,801 --> 02:36:29,170
not to disrespect pussies because
policies are tough,

3849
02:36:29,200 --> 02:36:32,860
but I think that something needs to be
dangerous.

3850
02:36:32,860 --> 02:36:36,320
The best compliment I got on this press
run has been like and brochures,

3851
02:36:36,340 --> 02:36:38,740
Ambrosia for headset.
How's it feel to have some [inaudible]

3852
02:36:38,780 --> 02:36:41,800
show on TV?
And it's dangerous because it unites

3853
02:36:41,801 --> 02:36:44,350
people,
does it separate people?

3854
02:36:44,351 --> 02:36:47,050
It gives you alternative answers in the
ones you thought you had and it forces

3855
02:36:47,051 --> 02:36:50,380
you to think it doesn't solve all the
problems or wrap it up pretty at the

3856
02:36:50,381 --> 02:36:52,330
end.
Gives you some options to do and some

3857
02:36:52,331 --> 02:36:54,570
shit to think about us.
And it's funny as fuck.

3858
02:36:54,571 --> 02:36:58,570
And so first of in dark and I like it.
I got an imagine netflix give you plenty

3859
02:36:58,571 --> 02:37:00,040
of room.
Yeah.

3860
02:37:00,041 --> 02:37:03,190
Hell they weren't tripping man.
They don't trip.

3861
02:37:03,550 --> 02:37:05,320
They don't trust go.
You know what you're doing.

3862
02:37:05,350 --> 02:37:06,760
Go ahead.
Yeah,

3863
02:37:06,790 --> 02:37:09,100
exactly.
And then you walk on the room like how

3864
02:37:09,101 --> 02:37:10,060
the fuck I'm doing.
But

3865
02:37:11,970 --> 02:37:16,070
they're smart enough to let people
create their own

3866
02:37:16,070 --> 02:37:17,330
shit.
Like for standup.

3867
02:37:17,331 --> 02:37:20,780
Comedy is no one better in terms of like
interacting with them about a special,

3868
02:37:20,781 --> 02:37:22,550
you don't have to give many any notes on
the material.

3869
02:37:23,400 --> 02:37:24,680
They,
they know that you're going to do your

3870
02:37:24,681 --> 02:37:25,514
best.
I felt.

3871
02:37:25,610 --> 02:37:26,600
Yeah,
they don't tell.

3872
02:37:26,750 --> 02:37:29,270
They can't help you.
Like no one can help you as a comic.

3873
02:37:29,271 --> 02:37:32,090
There's not a another person like an
executive is gonna help you do your

3874
02:37:32,091 --> 02:37:34,490
best.
You gotta you gotta be looking at it

3875
02:37:34,491 --> 02:37:36,590
yourself ruthlessly and you'll figure it
out.

3876
02:37:36,960 --> 02:37:38,150
And so they trust you.
Yeah.

3877
02:37:38,180 --> 02:37:39,710
So I would assume they did the same
thing with you.

3878
02:37:39,970 --> 02:37:40,803
Yeah.
Yeah.

3879
02:37:40,820 --> 02:37:41,780
Perfect.
Beautiful.

3880
02:37:42,290 --> 02:37:43,550
What a world.
Yeah.

3881
02:37:43,600 --> 02:37:44,990
The forever the,
it was the opposite.

3882
02:37:44,991 --> 02:37:46,660
There was 50 fucking cooks in the
kitchen.

3883
02:37:46,700 --> 02:37:49,160
Everybody's pulling you this way.
What neighbor to shit?

3884
02:37:49,740 --> 02:37:51,500
He need a fucking theme song.
You got,

3885
02:37:52,670 --> 02:37:55,190
you need a thing you say every week,
which you talk about Willis,

3886
02:37:56,270 --> 02:37:58,880
you need to hook.
Everybody needed a hook.

3887
02:37:58,940 --> 02:37:59,773
Oh Shit.

3888
02:38:05,360 --> 02:38:07,230
Oh my God.
Shouts outs.

3889
02:38:07,270 --> 02:38:09,650
Different strokes.
Yeah.

3890
02:38:09,651 --> 02:38:13,730
What a weird change in that short amount
of time from different strokes it today

3891
02:38:14,060 --> 02:38:15,140
in the world.
Yeah.

3892
02:38:15,380 --> 02:38:17,900
That's the weirdest thing.
I'm older than you,

3893
02:38:17,990 --> 02:38:19,760
but uh,
not so much older.

3894
02:38:19,761 --> 02:38:22,520
We grew up in similar times.
I'm 51 yeah.

3895
02:38:22,750 --> 02:38:26,120
You know,
when we were children for both of us,

3896
02:38:26,150 --> 02:38:29,090
the world was a way different place than
it is for children today.

3897
02:38:29,160 --> 02:38:31,540
Yeah.
These kids are being forced to turbo

3898
02:38:31,541 --> 02:38:33,860
charge their evolution and their
education.

3899
02:38:33,861 --> 02:38:37,580
They're getting every kid over the age
of like 13 has a phone.

3900
02:38:37,790 --> 02:38:40,100
Basically.
The parents hanging there as long as

3901
02:38:40,101 --> 02:38:42,170
they can.
That's filming the kids 13 here's the

3902
02:38:42,171 --> 02:38:44,180
whole world.
You little fuck adage is true.

3903
02:38:44,240 --> 02:38:47,180
Good luck and and and,
and the whole world at a push of a

3904
02:38:47,181 --> 02:38:51,230
button where my grandmother,
we get encyclopedias every four years

3905
02:38:53,360 --> 02:38:56,360
and I couldn't wait to get the new set
cause you got to read and learn new

3906
02:38:56,361 --> 02:38:59,810
information and now that information is
right there.

3907
02:38:59,810 --> 02:39:01,640
But if they aren't genuinely curious and
interested,

3908
02:39:01,641 --> 02:39:04,580
it'll die right there.
Well there's also a lot of things other

3909
02:39:04,581 --> 02:39:07,070
than that information.
It's not just an information device.

3910
02:39:07,071 --> 02:39:11,030
These fucking apps and these kids are
using back and forth with each other and

3911
02:39:11,031 --> 02:39:14,000
games and are so addictive.
Yeah.

3912
02:39:14,240 --> 02:39:16,310
We used to have this place called
outside too.

3913
02:39:16,311 --> 02:39:17,590
That was amazing.
Yeah.

3914
02:39:17,660 --> 02:39:20,660
Outdoors man.
I'd go and I'd just,

3915
02:39:20,661 --> 02:39:23,660
I'd be gone for hours and how it return
dirty as fuck.

3916
02:39:23,661 --> 02:39:25,460
Having one on hand,
an adventure.

3917
02:39:26,030 --> 02:39:27,410
That was that.
That was amazing.

3918
02:39:27,650 --> 02:39:30,260
Now he,
now even outdoors is regulated to some

3919
02:39:30,261 --> 02:39:34,550
also you worry about child molesters
creeps and you worry about shit.

3920
02:39:34,551 --> 02:39:38,270
We've almost like heard too much about
what's possible.

3921
02:39:38,510 --> 02:39:41,480
And then the fact that there are,
there are really still child molesters

3922
02:39:41,481 --> 02:39:43,880
out there.
They do exist and we also send them to

3923
02:39:43,881 --> 02:39:47,170
church with them so they know.
Some of our worries are,

3924
02:39:47,171 --> 02:39:48,740
are exasperated.
Yes.

3925
02:39:48,830 --> 02:39:49,760
Yeah,
for sure.

3926
02:39:50,480 --> 02:39:51,650
For sure.
Yeah.

3927
02:39:51,651 --> 02:39:53,600
That's one of the weirdest things ever.
Yeah.

3928
02:39:53,690 --> 02:39:56,600
Like more than likely to chime.
Let's say she was going to happen at a

3929
02:39:56,601 --> 02:39:59,810
place that's really,
maybe we should be getting outside

3930
02:39:59,811 --> 02:40:01,300
again.
You know,

3931
02:40:01,340 --> 02:40:02,780
I started,
I started at Man,

3932
02:40:03,190 --> 02:40:05,660
I said my man,
tell my wife,

3933
02:40:05,661 --> 02:40:08,540
you know,
get Michael a leaf blower to start going

3934
02:40:08,541 --> 02:40:10,730
back outside.
So I started looking for leaf blowers

3935
02:40:11,180 --> 02:40:14,010
but to jess and I started taking,
instead of having my nephew do

3936
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:16,140
it because I'm running around on twitter
and shit,

3937
02:40:16,141 --> 02:40:19,680
just when I'm home taking my own trash
up and down and spending some time

3938
02:40:19,681 --> 02:40:21,540
fucking around on my yard watching
around and stuff.

3939
02:40:21,750 --> 02:40:24,540
I just,
I realized being a rapper and living on

3940
02:40:24,541 --> 02:40:27,810
a tour bus,
how much I had stopped going outside,

3941
02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:29,940
you know,
meanwhile my cousins are fucking Haga

3942
02:40:29,970 --> 02:40:31,670
and his Georgia,
you know,

3943
02:40:32,460 --> 02:40:33,690
they got,
and I'm just like,

3944
02:40:33,691 --> 02:40:36,490
if it went down tomorrow,
like I'd be fuck.

3945
02:40:36,510 --> 02:40:37,171
Like I've,
you know,

3946
02:40:37,171 --> 02:40:39,120
I'm,
I'm rusty as a nail in the rain right

3947
02:40:39,121 --> 02:40:40,350
now,
so I just,

3948
02:40:40,351 --> 02:40:41,820
I,
I definitely think there's something to

3949
02:40:41,821 --> 02:40:46,320
be said for introducing your kids to
maybe a little more of what it was like

3950
02:40:46,980 --> 02:40:49,390
2030 years or 30 40 years ago.
You know,

3951
02:40:49,440 --> 02:40:52,590
just imagine that human beings lived
before houses.

3952
02:40:52,860 --> 02:40:55,020
Yeah.
There was humans and then they figured

3953
02:40:55,021 --> 02:40:56,320
out shelter,
you know,

3954
02:40:56,321 --> 02:40:58,350
the,
or it's some kind of rather some kind of

3955
02:40:58,351 --> 02:41:01,230
primate and then that primate figured
out shelter and eventually became a

3956
02:41:01,231 --> 02:41:02,490
human is a better way to describe it.

3957
02:41:02,490 --> 02:41:06,990
But
something like us lived and it hadn't

3958
02:41:06,991 --> 02:41:08,510
even figured out roofs yet.
Yeah.

3959
02:41:08,570 --> 02:41:09,331
Yeah.
I mean,

3960
02:41:09,331 --> 02:41:11,700
I love the wash shows,
those videos or youtube where it's

3961
02:41:11,701 --> 02:41:14,630
usually they in these people are there,
they're dark and they're age,

3962
02:41:14,750 --> 02:41:18,360
so it has to be the India or Southeast
Asia or somewhere.

3963
02:41:18,361 --> 02:41:19,290
But they,
they,

3964
02:41:19,291 --> 02:41:24,060
you'll see two dudes and they'll just
make a fucking a hut or something out of

3965
02:41:24,061 --> 02:41:25,110
mud.
They'll make a pool.

3966
02:41:25,111 --> 02:41:27,570
They're just,
but you get to see the ingenuity and you

3967
02:41:27,590 --> 02:41:30,900
understand if they're,
if they're quote unquote primitive

3968
02:41:30,901 --> 02:41:34,770
culture never does that.
We never get to skyscrapers like Jack

3969
02:41:34,770 --> 02:41:36,570
Fresco talks about that.
Like there's no nothing new.

3970
02:41:36,571 --> 02:41:39,780
Everything you see is a,
is an a is an improvement or some

3971
02:41:39,781 --> 02:41:41,400
variation of something they've seen
before.

3972
02:41:41,850 --> 02:41:43,080
So that those,
you know,

3973
02:41:43,081 --> 02:41:46,710
just the curiosity to do that or the
necessity to build that shelter,

3974
02:41:47,160 --> 02:41:48,870
you know,
now now gives you a trump tower.

3975
02:41:49,110 --> 02:41:51,090
So that's where the dark side of it
comes from.

3976
02:41:51,550 --> 02:41:55,560
Dark side for me is that with,
with this innovation that it happens

3977
02:41:55,710 --> 02:41:58,520
almost unchecked in terms of our
ability,

3978
02:41:59,100 --> 02:42:01,320
our ability to think about what are the
consequences,

3979
02:42:01,350 --> 02:42:04,200
like what are the consequences if we
keep making things better and better

3980
02:42:04,201 --> 02:42:06,270
computers.
And artificial life and artificial

3981
02:42:06,271 --> 02:42:08,070
intelligence and what w what are the
consequences?

3982
02:42:08,071 --> 02:42:11,430
The consequences of there's no more,
this thing is no more weird pink monkey

3983
02:42:11,431 --> 02:42:12,264
thing.
Yeah.

3984
02:42:12,270 --> 02:42:14,430
That that thing goes away because we
don't need it anymore.

3985
02:42:14,480 --> 02:42:17,040
Now we've got a new life form.
They new life form is digital life.

3986
02:42:17,100 --> 02:42:19,590
Yeah.
I mean that's the real real concern is

3987
02:42:19,591 --> 02:42:23,260
that just like we are an evolution of
those lower primates,

3988
02:42:23,330 --> 02:42:25,770
it's going to be an evolution.
I think that's going to happen.

3989
02:42:25,771 --> 02:42:26,830
I don't think I,
you know,

3990
02:42:26,840 --> 02:42:29,580
I,
there may not be any avoiding it by

3991
02:42:29,660 --> 02:42:30,210
diet.

3992
02:42:30,210 --> 02:42:32,010
Again,
we're the virus,

3993
02:42:32,230 --> 02:42:34,400
you know,
and this is just one of my thoughts is

3994
02:42:34,401 --> 02:42:37,110
that me saying unequivocably that we put
virus.

3995
02:42:37,150 --> 02:42:37,650
Yes.
Yeah.

3996
02:42:37,650 --> 02:42:40,500
The thing is I like people like the
other side of it,

3997
02:42:40,530 --> 02:42:44,260
people are cool dounreay that aliens go
ahead and attack this motherfucker.

3998
02:42:44,310 --> 02:42:47,670
So white people or black people or cut
the bullshit and finally have to do

3999
02:42:47,671 --> 02:42:49,500
night like one great movie of Red
October.

4000
02:42:49,800 --> 02:42:53,520
I think we're going to get our asses
kicked every saying we're not at least

4001
02:42:53,521 --> 02:42:56,670
at least for one time humanity.
All the empires would have to unite.

4002
02:42:56,700 --> 02:42:58,740
Like that's what I'm saying.
Remember that Reagan's speech?

4003
02:42:58,830 --> 02:42:59,970
No,
you never heard it.

4004
02:43:00,500 --> 02:43:03,120
Reagan actually said that in a,
he was,

4005
02:43:03,480 --> 02:43:06,990
I forget who he was addressing.
Maybe the first person to ask besides

4006
02:43:06,991 --> 02:43:10,410
him putting in the civil right that I
mean the cane day you might give me.

4007
02:43:10,411 --> 02:43:13,100
The only other thing I like about Ronald
Reagan was a very strict,

4008
02:43:14,530 --> 02:43:17,800
one of the things that was really
strange about it was that it's,

4009
02:43:17,830 --> 02:43:22,830
it's shut off this gigantic wave of
conspiracy theorists who were thinking

4010
02:43:23,381 --> 02:43:26,740
that they're going to tell us something
about alien contact.

4011
02:43:26,800 --> 02:43:27,970
Check this out,
listen to this

4012
02:43:30,290 --> 02:43:35,290
outside universal thread.
I occasionally think how quickly our

4013
02:43:35,451 --> 02:43:40,451
differences worldwide would vanish if we
were facing an alien threat from outside

4014
02:43:42,410 --> 02:43:47,410
this word dude and yes,
I asked you is not an alien force

4015
02:43:48,051 --> 02:43:51,680
already among us.
What could be more alien to the

4016
02:43:52,250 --> 02:43:56,730
universal aspirations of our peoples
than war and the threat of

4017
02:43:57,720 --> 02:44:01,650
tell you what to Ronald Reagan knocked
it out of the fucking park right there.

4018
02:44:03,270 --> 02:44:04,980
Straight up.
I have a song called Reagan.

4019
02:44:04,981 --> 02:44:08,880
Many of you know wasn't the biggest fan
of him or many of us presidents cause I

4020
02:44:08,881 --> 02:44:12,120
rapped about more than him in there,
but that definitely is going to make it

4021
02:44:12,121 --> 02:44:13,880
on a killer Mike Song.
Really that,

4022
02:44:13,890 --> 02:44:15,290
that,
that to you.

4023
02:44:15,300 --> 02:44:17,160
Got It.
You got this killer Mike and LP.

4024
02:44:17,161 --> 02:44:19,260
We definitely,
if anybody think aliens are going to

4025
02:44:19,261 --> 02:44:22,750
come kill us all one day,
so I'm going to maybe suggest to ail.

4026
02:44:22,751 --> 02:44:24,780
Hopefully we'll use it,
but if not fucking I'm gonna do it.

4027
02:44:25,240 --> 02:44:26,700
Dad.
Shit is amazing.

4028
02:44:26,730 --> 02:44:27,750
Yeah.
Yeah.

4029
02:44:28,500 --> 02:44:30,300
What do you,
do you think that it is possible that

4030
02:44:30,301 --> 02:44:33,330
aliens came down and manipulated the
genetics of lower primates and creative

4031
02:44:33,331 --> 02:44:37,410
people?
I'm willing based on all the theology,

4032
02:44:37,560 --> 02:44:38,610
I'm willing to accept it.

4033
02:44:38,610 --> 02:44:41,700
That's a possibility because I don't
think that we're alone.

4034
02:44:41,970 --> 02:44:43,470
Right.
I just don't.

4035
02:44:43,490 --> 02:44:44,323
I,
there's nothing,

4036
02:44:44,370 --> 02:44:47,670
even if there is some divine thing that
woke up and decided to make us and we're

4037
02:44:47,680 --> 02:44:49,450
a special children and we on our to the
boot plant,

4038
02:44:49,810 --> 02:44:52,740
there had to have been some other things
made her play with.

4039
02:44:52,741 --> 02:44:55,830
Right.
I don't think that I think is very

4040
02:44:55,831 --> 02:44:59,400
arrogant as a human being to think that
it's just us.

4041
02:44:59,401 --> 02:45:02,700
Right,
and I think that the possibility that

4042
02:45:02,701 --> 02:45:05,490
something made it here and something
happened exist.

4043
02:45:05,520 --> 02:45:09,150
Absolutely.
Because if we're experimenting on

4044
02:45:09,151 --> 02:45:14,151
animals and things,
we got like my daughter's army,

4045
02:45:15,690 --> 02:45:19,740
their temperament is mean.
They're curiosity is me.

4046
02:45:19,800 --> 02:45:22,440
Like I see,
I'm looking at Michael and I'm looking

4047
02:45:22,441 --> 02:45:24,910
at a night and I'm like arguing with
tonight.

4048
02:45:24,930 --> 02:45:28,170
It's like arguing with myself.
She doesn't know why she acts like that.

4049
02:45:28,590 --> 02:45:29,270
I don't know.

4050
02:45:29,270 --> 02:45:31,200
Now if I can look at my pit bull and
say,

4051
02:45:31,530 --> 02:45:33,570
well,
her mother acted like this and this is

4052
02:45:33,571 --> 02:45:36,270
why I know she's coded this way.
I know her father was his.

4053
02:45:36,480 --> 02:45:39,060
Then I have to look at my daughter and
save on a genetic basis,

4054
02:45:39,061 --> 02:45:41,260
23 and my chromosomes.
I know our temperament.

4055
02:45:41,261 --> 02:45:44,070
It's like that.
I know why Michael is not going to argue

4056
02:45:44,290 --> 02:45:46,020
she's a smart kid.
She's an art student,

4057
02:45:46,140 --> 02:45:48,990
but the minute you put her in danger,
she's going to punch you.

4058
02:45:49,200 --> 02:45:50,100
You know what I mean?
That's what,

4059
02:45:50,101 --> 02:45:53,010
that's what it's going to be and it's
not going to be anything else because

4060
02:45:53,190 --> 02:45:55,440
she is going to protect her.
And so it's like,

4061
02:45:56,010 --> 02:45:58,560
I have to think that my curiosity,
if nothing else,

4062
02:45:58,561 --> 02:46:01,440
my drive to do this.
So if you take the primate side,

4063
02:46:01,441 --> 02:46:02,980
you say,
well you know you,

4064
02:46:02,981 --> 02:46:05,740
you know that I have to live in mark
since I got to survive as wolves,

4065
02:46:05,741 --> 02:46:06,481
as Lions,
tigers,

4066
02:46:06,481 --> 02:46:08,160
bears out here,
I have to go high,

4067
02:46:08,161 --> 02:46:08,994
I have to create shelf.

4068
02:46:09,080 --> 02:46:13,460
There's something else with was a very
small input could have dropped here,

4069
02:46:13,700 --> 02:46:15,050
landed here.
And what's crazy,

4070
02:46:15,130 --> 02:46:17,810
if you look into nation of Islam
philosophy of sorts,

4071
02:46:17,811 --> 02:46:21,740
they have a Ufo type philosophy.
Something here in and by their amount of

4072
02:46:21,760 --> 02:46:23,750
scientists created,
you know,

4073
02:46:23,751 --> 02:46:26,990
all of,
of when a Shrek rain kind of created the

4074
02:46:26,991 --> 02:46:29,790
different races.
But something could have come here in it

4075
02:46:29,880 --> 02:46:34,400
and it gets here and it says Bonet with
I do this and this and I create this.

4076
02:46:34,401 --> 02:46:36,890
And then we set upon evolution and we
ended up here.

4077
02:46:37,070 --> 02:46:38,270
Or that's just could be,
you know,

4078
02:46:38,271 --> 02:46:40,310
me stone having watched too many south
five movies.

4079
02:46:40,490 --> 02:46:42,200
But it's possible.
It is.

4080
02:46:42,500 --> 02:46:44,870
It is possible.
There's zero evidence for it,

4081
02:46:44,900 --> 02:46:47,810
but it's certainly possible that if we
could go to another planet,

4082
02:46:47,870 --> 02:46:51,380
we knew how in life that it's possible
if we found some lower primates that we

4083
02:46:51,381 --> 02:46:55,370
would manipulate them.
It's very possible for a full survey of

4084
02:46:55,371 --> 02:46:57,050
another planet we got there and like,
okay,

4085
02:46:57,051 --> 02:46:58,010
here's the good news,
good news.

4086
02:46:58,011 --> 02:47:00,320
A lot of life.
The bad news is the most intelligent

4087
02:47:00,321 --> 02:47:04,010
thing is basically a chimp,
but we've got some ideas and a we're

4088
02:47:04,011 --> 02:47:07,640
going to do is we're going to plant some
seeds of our genetics in some of these

4089
02:47:07,641 --> 02:47:08,720
chimps.
They're going to be smarter than the

4090
02:47:08,721 --> 02:47:10,280
other chimps.
And then we're gonna believe mushrooms

4091
02:47:10,281 --> 02:47:11,114
everywhere.

4092
02:47:12,800 --> 02:47:14,480
Leave the mushrooms everywhere.
Let the chimps,

4093
02:47:14,481 --> 02:47:17,120
he'd mushrooms.
Maybe we're in a fishbowl maybe.

4094
02:47:17,240 --> 02:47:18,260
Yeah.
Cause again,

4095
02:47:18,500 --> 02:47:21,080
we're at,
we very arrogantly think of ourselves is

4096
02:47:21,440 --> 02:47:22,880
as top choice,
but maybe,

4097
02:47:22,910 --> 02:47:25,280
maybe we're just a virus on this living
thing.

4098
02:47:25,281 --> 02:47:27,080
Maybe something maybe,
you know,

4099
02:47:27,110 --> 02:47:31,100
we say,
but we could go a state of virus,

4100
02:47:31,101 --> 02:47:33,020
amass virus could kill us all.
Yup,

4101
02:47:33,550 --> 02:47:35,150
sure.
That's what we're constantly fighting.

4102
02:47:35,210 --> 02:47:38,510
The earth wouldn't stop,
but they'll think about viruses like get

4103
02:47:38,511 --> 02:47:42,650
viruses wholly negative in our eyes.
I don't think we're wholly negative to

4104
02:47:42,651 --> 02:47:44,210
each other.
I don't think a virus thinks his

4105
02:47:44,211 --> 02:47:46,190
holiness.
So what I'm saying is that eating you

4106
02:47:46,191 --> 02:47:47,060
up,
you're having a good party.

4107
02:47:47,061 --> 02:47:47,900
When you get the flow,
they're like,

4108
02:47:47,901 --> 02:47:50,900
dude,
it's probably up if this thing is really

4109
02:47:50,901 --> 02:47:53,300
a living thing.
If the earth is really living thing,

4110
02:47:53,750 --> 02:47:55,790
we are possibly the worst thing.
Sore it.

4111
02:47:56,060 --> 02:47:56,570
Oh,
for sure.

4112
02:47:56,570 --> 02:47:58,340
Last.
Shouldn't it get rid of us other than

4113
02:47:58,341 --> 02:47:59,270
meteors?
Yeah.

4114
02:47:59,570 --> 02:48:01,730
Yeah.
We're the worst thing for not just the

4115
02:48:01,731 --> 02:48:04,660
biological life,
but the particulates in the atmosphere

4116
02:48:04,661 --> 02:48:07,340
and now we're creating technology that's
going to eventually kill us and get rid

4117
02:48:07,341 --> 02:48:10,110
of us that may be able to live in
harmony with biology maybe.

4118
02:48:10,130 --> 02:48:10,521
So.
Yeah,

4119
02:48:10,521 --> 02:48:13,040
maybe.
Maybe it's over for us in a few thousand

4120
02:48:13,040 --> 02:48:14,390
years.
It could be.

4121
02:48:14,420 --> 02:48:17,990
But you know,
the thing that makes us fun is the thing

4122
02:48:17,991 --> 02:48:20,900
that's totally unnecessary.
It's the thing that got us to the dance.

4123
02:48:20,930 --> 02:48:24,460
It's the thing that made us want to
breed and there's the animal side.

4124
02:48:24,500 --> 02:48:26,120
I got to Piss so bad I can get it.

4125
02:48:28,700 --> 02:48:31,070
The animal side,
you have to embrace your primal.

4126
02:48:31,100 --> 02:48:32,090
There is,
it's there,

4127
02:48:32,120 --> 02:48:33,240
it's a part of you.
Yeah.

4128
02:48:33,550 --> 02:48:36,560
You've existed in this state for a long
time.

4129
02:48:36,561 --> 02:48:38,330
Fucking,
and the people that came before that

4130
02:48:38,331 --> 02:48:40,460
were savage are still,
you know,

4131
02:48:40,500 --> 02:48:42,890
yeah.
I always think that to myself when I

4132
02:48:42,891 --> 02:48:45,860
hear people say,
why did he throw it all away?

4133
02:48:46,070 --> 02:48:49,190
It just stick to yourself.
Cause that bitch was hot.

4134
02:48:51,150 --> 02:48:52,580
Yeah.
Fight Nature.

4135
02:48:52,860 --> 02:48:55,400
Nature's a crazy gene.
Crazy fun.

4136
02:48:55,730 --> 02:48:57,590
And that's the reason why there's 7
billion of us.

4137
02:48:57,610 --> 02:48:58,730
This,
it's insane.

4138
02:48:58,731 --> 02:49:01,910
Drive this computer code that's in the
back of your head is constantly running.

4139
02:49:02,030 --> 02:49:03,870
They had a species must survive.
It must,

4140
02:49:03,940 --> 02:49:06,170
that's really all we put here to do is
reproduce.

4141
02:49:06,590 --> 02:49:07,830
Well,
we're doing that.

4142
02:49:07,880 --> 02:49:08,450
Where

4143
02:49:08,450 --> 02:49:09,960
I've been,
the way I've been describing it is that

4144
02:49:09,961 --> 02:49:11,850
I feel like we're some sort of,
uh,

4145
02:49:11,910 --> 02:49:15,000
electronic caterpillar that's making a
cocoon.

4146
02:49:15,001 --> 02:49:17,160
We don't even know what the fuck we're
doing and we're about to become a

4147
02:49:17,161 --> 02:49:21,180
butterfly or just megan is cocoon and we
just completely engulfed in it.

4148
02:49:21,210 --> 02:49:22,890
We're not thinking about it,
but everyone does it.

4149
02:49:23,070 --> 02:49:25,770
They all do it.
That's how I felt.

4150
02:49:25,771 --> 02:49:27,030
Like when I,
when I,

4151
02:49:27,090 --> 02:49:30,720
when I see all this stuff getting better
and better and more invasive in your

4152
02:49:30,721 --> 02:49:33,540
life and the technology becoming more
and more advanced and everybody obsessed

4153
02:49:33,541 --> 02:49:35,490
with it,
that's the thing I think is like,

4154
02:49:35,520 --> 02:49:37,320
this is eventually going to be
everything.

4155
02:49:37,860 --> 02:49:40,650
It's going to be way better than this
physical life.

4156
02:49:40,651 --> 02:49:43,320
They're gonna offer you a life that
exists just like the Matrix.

4157
02:49:43,321 --> 02:49:45,900
The Matrix sounded like such horse Shit,
Fun,

4158
02:49:46,140 --> 02:49:47,940
fun movie,
great movie and Shit.

4159
02:49:48,060 --> 02:49:53,060
But like that can never happen now.
I think for sure it could happen 100%.

4160
02:49:53,431 --> 02:49:58,140
It could happen.
I see that there's no question.

4161
02:49:58,170 --> 02:50:01,170
If they could make a world that's better
than this and all you had to do is plug

4162
02:50:01,171 --> 02:50:02,400
the back of your head.
Let's see.

4163
02:50:02,401 --> 02:50:03,420
I think that's,
and um,

4164
02:50:03,530 --> 02:50:05,400
and again,
if I'm 89,

4165
02:50:06,480 --> 02:50:08,700
I might say fuck in and plug in for
another 80,

4166
02:50:08,710 --> 02:50:09,670
89.
Yeah.

4167
02:50:09,810 --> 02:50:13,260
And maybe if they keep your flesh alive,
they'll figure out some way to reverse

4168
02:50:13,261 --> 02:50:14,340
everything.
Maybe.

4169
02:50:14,440 --> 02:50:16,770
Uh,
maybe you think,

4170
02:50:16,800 --> 02:50:17,910
I mean,
but then Dan,

4171
02:50:17,911 --> 02:50:19,860
you got to decide who gets to live,
who gets a dye.

4172
02:50:19,890 --> 02:50:21,660
Yup.
You go into it and we get some classes

4173
02:50:21,800 --> 02:50:25,680
he thinks most and then you gotta you
gotta you gotta go to kill your master's

4174
02:50:25,681 --> 02:50:28,170
mode.
And that's what I think happens.

4175
02:50:28,230 --> 02:50:30,720
Ultimately,
that's the thing they say is that as

4176
02:50:30,721 --> 02:50:33,030
people get more affluent,
they have less children in the

4177
02:50:33,031 --> 02:50:37,980
population decreases as the world's
economy evens out and so that we reached

4178
02:50:37,981 --> 02:50:41,190
like a point where we can maintain a
sustainable population.

4179
02:50:41,640 --> 02:50:45,570
How does that has still happened without
mass genocide or mass sterilization?

4180
02:50:45,600 --> 02:50:47,190
That's a good question.
I don't think they're saying that.

4181
02:50:47,191 --> 02:50:51,270
I think what they're saying is that as
people become more educated and more

4182
02:50:51,271 --> 02:50:55,530
affluent and more successful,
as more urbanization takes place,

4183
02:50:55,740 --> 02:50:58,950
people work more and have less children
and when they have less children,

4184
02:50:58,951 --> 02:51:00,810
the population actually slightly
decreases.

4185
02:51:00,840 --> 02:51:04,620
This is this argument,
but I don't mind fuck more people who

4186
02:51:04,621 --> 02:51:07,510
fuck more,
have more children night.

4187
02:51:07,880 --> 02:51:09,870
That just,
that's one of those stats where I'm be

4188
02:51:09,871 --> 02:51:10,650
like,
they might do,

4189
02:51:10,650 --> 02:51:13,680
they might just be talking about a
particular class of people.

4190
02:51:13,830 --> 02:51:16,020
They're still sell 7 billion people.
Yeah,

4191
02:51:16,021 --> 02:51:19,710
there's still 7 billion people live
mostly for under 22,000 a year.

4192
02:51:19,730 --> 02:51:22,890
Yeah.
And it usually every time development

4193
02:51:22,891 --> 02:51:24,660
comms at exploits them.
Yes.

4194
02:51:24,690 --> 02:51:27,450
So like where does the balance out of
affluence coming?

4195
02:51:27,451 --> 02:51:31,470
Like I know there's one country now
that's doing a universal pay for people.

4196
02:51:31,470 --> 02:51:35,490
So are we going to talk about going,
because when you go to like is does that

4197
02:51:35,491 --> 02:51:36,210
happen?
Is that,

4198
02:51:36,210 --> 02:51:37,920
is that it?
We're going to universal pay.

4199
02:51:37,950 --> 02:51:40,290
Well universal paid would be fine if it
was universal effort.

4200
02:51:40,530 --> 02:51:42,360
If everybody did it,
put it out the same amount of effort.

4201
02:51:42,361 --> 02:51:43,760
I would agree with everyone getting to
say no.

4202
02:51:43,770 --> 02:51:46,890
I'm not saying I'm for or against that.
I'm just saying how do you maintain,

4203
02:51:47,670 --> 02:51:50,010
how does it,
how does it happen that everybody all of

4204
02:51:50,011 --> 02:51:53,460
a sudden it's affluent without mass
genocide of sterilization.

4205
02:51:53,461 --> 02:51:55,800
But think the idea is that as urban,
and listen,

4206
02:51:55,801 --> 02:51:57,810
this is not my theory for sure,
but I've read it.

4207
02:51:57,840 --> 02:52:02,640
The idea is as the world becomes more
urbanized and more educated and more

4208
02:52:02,641 --> 02:52:06,640
wealthy as as city spread out,
what happens is less.

4209
02:52:06,641 --> 02:52:09,490
Those people have kids and they have
less kids.

4210
02:52:09,970 --> 02:52:12,530
This is just a,
and it doesn't work that well.

4211
02:52:12,530 --> 02:52:15,250
I don't know if it works or not,
but I know that this is an actual study.

4212
02:52:15,580 --> 02:52:17,110
Right.
See if you could find that he pulled her

4213
02:52:17,111 --> 02:52:18,970
vein is fuck,
some people are,

4214
02:52:19,270 --> 02:52:20,410
yeah,
most people are,

4215
02:52:20,640 --> 02:52:24,100
but the overall humans,
once people have serious careers,

4216
02:52:24,101 --> 02:52:25,690
like the man and the woman have a
serious career,

4217
02:52:25,720 --> 02:52:27,150
they,
both of them are like really invested in

4218
02:52:27,151 --> 02:52:29,290
the career.
They generally tend to have less kids.

4219
02:52:29,620 --> 02:52:32,230
And when the,
this is the idea is that as this people,

4220
02:52:32,470 --> 02:52:33,640
I don't know,
it's a solution.

4221
02:52:33,641 --> 02:52:36,220
I don't think it's a good solution.
I've made people become obsessed with

4222
02:52:36,221 --> 02:52:37,090
work.
That's one of the things,

4223
02:52:37,250 --> 02:52:40,600
but the rest of the world's just not,
that sounds like I'm still talking about

4224
02:52:40,601 --> 02:52:43,270
America.
Like I poor people are fucking man.

4225
02:52:43,600 --> 02:52:46,240
So again,
I just called back to me like I hear it

4226
02:52:46,241 --> 02:52:48,040
all studies show,
but you gotta say to yourself,

4227
02:52:48,530 --> 02:52:51,280
how,
how do you handle the other 4 billion

4228
02:52:51,281 --> 02:52:51,910
people?

4229
02:52:51,910 --> 02:52:54,600
I think the argument is,
and this is not my argument today,

4230
02:52:54,650 --> 02:52:55,840
they go,
they keep,

4231
02:52:55,960 --> 02:52:59,200
they keep expanding is that these cities
and these urban areas,

4232
02:52:59,230 --> 02:53:03,310
uh,
that as the society sort of evens out

4233
02:53:03,430 --> 02:53:06,190
globally,
whether it takes a thousand years or a

4234
02:53:06,190 --> 02:53:10,420
hundred years as things start to even
out people will be more like Los Angeles

4235
02:53:10,660 --> 02:53:14,110
and less like less like poor place at
Calcutta.

4236
02:53:14,170 --> 02:53:15,160
Yeah.
Potass site.

4237
02:53:15,190 --> 02:53:18,610
But what I'm saying,
it's like poor in Calcutta.

4238
02:53:18,640 --> 02:53:21,010
You got a bunch of people walking.
It's pumped in this noise.

4239
02:53:21,011 --> 02:53:22,870
It could be a Los Angeles.
She got small,

4240
02:53:22,871 --> 02:53:24,020
you've got traffic,
you've got Trisha,

4241
02:53:24,030 --> 02:53:25,310
anything.
My death.

4242
02:53:25,330 --> 02:53:27,910
There's Delta two different extremes
that that just seem weird.

4243
02:53:28,060 --> 02:53:30,370
Like I'm just saying,
you know,

4244
02:53:30,371 --> 02:53:32,320
sometimes I just feel like maybe we are
at the point,

4245
02:53:32,500 --> 02:53:36,550
it ain't no turning around then we might
be just cause we got 7 billion people.

4246
02:53:36,610 --> 02:53:38,500
We might be,
but we also might not be.

4247
02:53:38,530 --> 02:53:41,590
And I think it's not a bad time to be
optimistic because as people look for

4248
02:53:41,591 --> 02:53:44,950
better and better solutions,
but,

4249
02:53:44,990 --> 02:53:49,990
but like jock fresco and the Venus
project talking about moneyless society

4250
02:53:51,011 --> 02:53:54,730
to rather radical change of what a
political states and things of that

4251
02:53:54,731 --> 02:53:57,970
nature chompsky talks about,
you know,

4252
02:53:57,971 --> 02:54:01,600
essentially all all countries
essentially now no matter western or

4253
02:54:01,601 --> 02:54:06,490
eastern oligarchies and shit.
So like what's the radical departure

4254
02:54:06,491 --> 02:54:08,440
from this and that saves it all in your
mind.

4255
02:54:08,441 --> 02:54:11,500
Like with the Joe Rogan,
United Nations speech,

4256
02:54:11,560 --> 02:54:14,500
I think people are more aware of the
flaws of the system than they ever have

4257
02:54:14,501 --> 02:54:16,380
been any generation previous.
Okay.

4258
02:54:16,470 --> 02:54:19,510
I think when you look at kids from the
seventies and eighties I don't think

4259
02:54:19,511 --> 02:54:24,400
there were nearly as educated as to how
truly fucked up this country is and but

4260
02:54:24,401 --> 02:54:28,510
also yet truly amazing in terms of like
the history of the world,

4261
02:54:28,900 --> 02:54:31,780
but has plenty to printing to improve
on.

4262
02:54:32,080 --> 02:54:34,720
But probably will.
I think people are getting better at

4263
02:54:34,721 --> 02:54:38,080
life to getting better at all,
all of the things and government will

4264
02:54:38,081 --> 02:54:40,180
come along with it.
I think we're going to get better at

4265
02:54:40,181 --> 02:54:41,470
things.
We understand each other better.

4266
02:54:41,530 --> 02:54:46,530
We communicate better is I'm optimistic
and I think with all these incredibly

4267
02:54:47,411 --> 02:54:50,440
intelligent people that are looking at
the problems in the world in terms of

4268
02:54:50,500 --> 02:54:52,840
carbon,
in the atmosphere or pollution in the

4269
02:54:52,841 --> 02:54:55,420
ocean,
people are already starting to work on

4270
02:54:55,421 --> 02:54:56,550
solutions.
I got,

4271
02:54:56,590 --> 02:54:59,620
I'm really optimistic that,
that it's,

4272
02:54:59,800 --> 02:55:03,770
there's at least a potential for someone
to figure out some to some of these

4273
02:55:03,771 --> 02:55:06,440
problems.
Overpopulation is always going to be a

4274
02:55:06,441 --> 02:55:10,280
weird one because you don't have the
right to tell people how many kids they

4275
02:55:10,281 --> 02:55:13,400
can have cars who,
like if you meet somebody who's got 10

4276
02:55:13,401 --> 02:55:15,470
kids and the most fucking amazing family
ever,

4277
02:55:15,760 --> 02:55:16,593
what,
what?

4278
02:55:16,630 --> 02:55:18,350
What are you gonna say?
It's bad.

4279
02:55:18,860 --> 02:55:20,930
They have 10 amazing kids.
Everybody's great.

4280
02:55:20,931 --> 02:55:22,100
You go over the house,
it's all love.

4281
02:55:22,160 --> 02:55:23,210
Yeah.
What the fuck?

4282
02:55:23,330 --> 02:55:24,500
Why is that bad?
You tell me.

4283
02:55:24,501 --> 02:55:26,000
So.
So people are good,

4284
02:55:26,030 --> 02:55:27,370
but only a certain amount.
Yeah,

4285
02:55:27,470 --> 02:55:29,060
exactly.
That's where it gets weird,

4286
02:55:29,450 --> 02:55:31,970
but,
but it's not a cut and dry issue.

4287
02:55:31,971 --> 02:55:33,590
It's not a one or a zero.
It's like,

4288
02:55:33,591 --> 02:55:34,910
yeah,
there are too many people and yeah,

4289
02:55:34,911 --> 02:55:37,790
you probably shouldn't have 10 kids,
but you gotta fucking awesome family,

4290
02:55:37,791 --> 02:55:39,510
so hey,
have a good nightmare.

4291
02:55:39,570 --> 02:55:40,640
Yeah.
What the fuck to do?

4292
02:55:40,670 --> 02:55:41,380
Yeah,
yeah,

4293
02:55:41,380 --> 02:55:42,213
yeah,
yeah.

4294
02:55:42,590 --> 02:55:46,250
You know,
it just speaking as you know,

4295
02:55:46,340 --> 02:55:49,820
just has a lot of their brow people.
Just this scenario,

4296
02:55:49,821 --> 02:55:51,740
this is never went well for us.
I'm always,

4297
02:55:52,520 --> 02:55:54,770
always,
always check it out.

4298
02:55:54,830 --> 02:55:57,490
You can't tell him what to do.
He just always watching you.

4299
02:55:57,491 --> 02:55:58,270
You know what I'm saying?

4300
02:55:58,270 --> 02:56:03,170
This das scenario usually doesn't go
good telling people how many kids are

4301
02:56:03,171 --> 02:56:04,600
gonna have kit though.
Fuck at that.

4302
02:56:04,610 --> 02:56:07,130
But it happens like it happens.
You think about,

4303
02:56:07,160 --> 02:56:10,160
you think about countries where refugees
are pointing to now,

4304
02:56:10,161 --> 02:56:14,220
just just put up illegal sterilization
and you start to see,

4305
02:56:14,240 --> 02:56:17,090
you start to see where countries are
still alive and refugees that are coming

4306
02:56:17,091 --> 02:56:18,740
in.
It's crazy and it's scary.

4307
02:56:18,790 --> 02:56:23,090
It was terrifying.
And I don't want my country to become

4308
02:56:23,091 --> 02:56:24,650
that.
Like I remember what countries have

4309
02:56:24,651 --> 02:56:28,210
sterilized people as they've come in.
I've read a story about it once that

4310
02:56:28,211 --> 02:56:30,800
they did that to some refugee somewhere,
but I can't remember where it was.

4311
02:56:30,860 --> 02:56:31,790
Hey,
I can't remember either.

4312
02:56:31,800 --> 02:56:33,440
I'm squishing.
Probably know so,

4313
02:56:33,490 --> 02:56:36,680
yeah,
but I a country accused of sterilizing

4314
02:56:36,681 --> 02:56:38,390
refugees.
Maybe that was just a rumor.

4315
02:56:38,930 --> 02:56:41,780
Maybe it's what the snow is.
Not all of them.

4316
02:56:41,830 --> 02:56:44,820
I could imagine that happening here.
Not Saying,

4317
02:56:44,870 --> 02:56:47,180
not saying with some people if they had
their way.

4318
02:56:47,210 --> 02:56:49,580
Yeah,
and that's scary to think about it.

4319
02:56:49,581 --> 02:56:52,760
These are the people we put in power.
Like you know what was cool to me about

4320
02:56:52,761 --> 02:56:55,640
what Ms. Ellis and taught me,
she was,

4321
02:56:55,730 --> 02:56:57,110
she was a teacher.
She had one leg,

4322
02:56:57,290 --> 02:57:00,140
right?
She and she wore like a curly met Larry

4323
02:57:00,141 --> 02:57:01,860
and mold three stooges.
She wore the,

4324
02:57:01,861 --> 02:57:04,570
the like the little mushroom hairstyle
curling up.

4325
02:57:05,180 --> 02:57:06,950
And she was mean as shit,
man.

4326
02:57:06,980 --> 02:57:08,510
Like God damn,
she was mean.

4327
02:57:08,990 --> 02:57:13,880
But this lady talked to fucking,
she taught civics and when she taught

4328
02:57:13,910 --> 02:57:16,400
about how,
even if your parents weren't

4329
02:57:16,670 --> 02:57:19,820
naturalizing weren't citizens,
if you were just born on us soil,

4330
02:57:20,720 --> 02:57:22,550
you got shot.
You know you were a citizen.

4331
02:57:22,580 --> 02:57:23,331
Yeah.
I'll just like,

4332
02:57:23,331 --> 02:57:24,290
damn,
that's amazing.

4333
02:57:24,291 --> 02:57:27,830
Because when you think about,
at that time we had learned about,

4334
02:57:27,920 --> 02:57:30,800
I think in history of the Irish and
their plight to be here and things of

4335
02:57:30,801 --> 02:57:31,610
that nature.

4336
02:57:31,610 --> 02:57:32,241
Just like,
man,

4337
02:57:32,241 --> 02:57:35,900
this country gives you a fucking shot.
And this is like when America was

4338
02:57:35,901 --> 02:57:37,610
rattled,
this is in the middle of public enemy

4339
02:57:37,611 --> 02:57:40,880
Erin Shit.
But there was something to be admired in

4340
02:57:40,881 --> 02:57:43,640
it.
Like James Baldwin had an adoration for

4341
02:57:43,641 --> 02:57:45,200
American,
had many people didn't even know he

4342
02:57:45,201 --> 02:57:46,190
ended up dying.
You know,

4343
02:57:46,191 --> 02:57:49,340
as he's living in France.
I think the expectation that dream,

4344
02:57:49,341 --> 02:57:51,800
that American sales you manage shit is
amazing.

4345
02:57:51,830 --> 02:57:55,340
Eric can be,
and to know that that was a possibility

4346
02:57:55,610 --> 02:57:58,910
then and now my kids don't think like
that and my kids are dead in the middle

4347
02:57:58,911 --> 02:58:01,590
of keeping people out as shit.
It's fucking weird.

4348
02:58:01,591 --> 02:58:02,130
So

4349
02:58:02,130 --> 02:58:05,130
in my lifetime,
I'm scared to death something I'm I see

4350
02:58:05,131 --> 02:58:08,460
happening in this country.
That's how afraid I am right now with

4351
02:58:08,461 --> 02:58:11,370
shit going fucked up.
That's what I mean when I say when you

4352
02:58:11,371 --> 02:58:12,570
say,
well,

4353
02:58:12,571 --> 02:58:17,571
we'll have a government or a world one
day where people will be a more fluent,

4354
02:58:17,611 --> 02:58:20,940
well in capitalism,
even though I'm a capitalist,

4355
02:58:20,941 --> 02:58:22,250
you know,
I try to practice compassionate

4356
02:58:22,260 --> 02:58:26,280
capitalism and capitalism.
Capitalism requires someone get

4357
02:58:26,281 --> 02:58:29,370
snuckered does it really the way we
practice it,

4358
02:58:29,371 --> 02:58:33,330
absolutely ideal that you shouldn't be
to be more like Milton Friedman and the

4359
02:58:33,331 --> 02:58:34,390
free market.
Right?

4360
02:58:34,410 --> 02:58:38,060
And what Thomas all talk about.
But we as in you and I know,

4361
02:58:38,400 --> 02:58:40,170
but we,
you and I engage in capitalism.

4362
02:58:40,200 --> 02:58:42,000
Yeah.
You and I occasionally capitalism has a

4363
02:58:42,001 --> 02:58:46,290
lot more fair than what countries are
doing with one another large scale sit

4364
02:58:46,300 --> 02:58:49,860
and stuff.
That's why I say the current system of

4365
02:58:49,861 --> 02:58:52,680
capitalist,
there's nothing wrong with you being

4366
02:58:52,681 --> 02:58:55,500
able to buy that beautiful jeep outside
based on the work you've done.

4367
02:58:55,500 --> 02:58:58,740
Your work ethic will determine your
worth is written in the window of my

4368
02:58:58,741 --> 02:59:00,420
barbershop.
And I really mean it,

4369
02:59:00,421 --> 02:59:01,970
right?
You're work ethic is gonna determine

4370
02:59:01,980 --> 02:59:03,540
with you or even if there was no such
thing as money,

4371
02:59:03,750 --> 02:59:05,880
if you plow your fields,
you going to be more bountiful.

4372
02:59:06,120 --> 02:59:08,210
So long it's been [inaudible] me ask you
this.

4373
02:59:08,230 --> 02:59:11,220
You think it's the system of capitalism
itself that has the flaws in it or is it

4374
02:59:11,221 --> 02:59:14,760
human nature as desire to exploit
things?

4375
02:59:15,120 --> 02:59:19,350
I think it's human nature unchecked in
that system.

4376
02:59:19,410 --> 02:59:20,160
Okay.
You know,

4377
02:59:20,160 --> 02:59:25,160
I think that allowing marijuana to
become legal should not have allowed.

4378
02:59:26,671 --> 02:59:29,400
The type of taxation that's been allowed
in California.

4379
02:59:30,330 --> 02:59:34,110
Colorado was at one point in time was
39% yeah.

4380
02:59:34,140 --> 02:59:35,700
What does it in California,
I don't know,

4381
02:59:35,701 --> 02:59:37,200
but it's high enough that I seen the
house.

4382
02:59:37,201 --> 02:59:40,020
So we'd go from about $150 to 320 bucks.

4383
02:59:40,050 --> 02:59:42,900
I think that's terrible.
But I would like it if all that money

4384
02:59:42,901 --> 02:59:44,760
went to a good purpose,
but we know it's not.

4385
02:59:44,761 --> 02:59:47,250
Yeah,
that's right.

4386
02:59:47,980 --> 02:59:49,620
Counting Shit.
You know what I'm saying?

4387
02:59:49,750 --> 02:59:52,710
[inaudible] it never lands where it
should.

4388
02:59:52,711 --> 02:59:55,500
It never does what it's supposed to do.
That's what I'm,

4389
02:59:55,530 --> 02:59:56,700
that's,
that's what I'm getting.

4390
02:59:57,030 --> 02:59:58,460
That's why I said when,
when Stereo,

4391
02:59:58,490 --> 02:59:59,041
when I say,
you know,

4392
02:59:59,041 --> 03:00:00,610
I want to be that guy,
but usually I go,

4393
03:00:00,611 --> 03:00:03,690
but for bribery,
just because you just like God fucking

4394
03:00:03,691 --> 03:00:04,920
damn.
Like,

4395
03:00:04,921 --> 03:00:08,490
why isn't good happening in the
immediate cause so much money is pushed

4396
03:00:08,491 --> 03:00:10,050
into the immediate,
well,

4397
03:00:10,140 --> 03:00:13,290
if we does become legal worldwide,
it's in Thai.

4398
03:00:13,310 --> 03:00:15,860
I mean countrywide,
it's entirely possible that it's going

4399
03:00:15,861 --> 03:00:18,150
to stimulate economies and a lot of very
poor places.

4400
03:00:18,151 --> 03:00:20,580
It's going to have some real positive
benefit.

4401
03:00:21,060 --> 03:00:22,080
I agree,
but,

4402
03:00:22,081 --> 03:00:24,720
but,
but what,

4403
03:00:24,800 --> 03:00:29,430
what I'm saying about capitalism is why
are we not ensuring that the people who

4404
03:00:29,431 --> 03:00:33,990
have suffered since 1937 have a fair
shot?

4405
03:00:34,140 --> 03:00:37,080
Right.
We've allowed so many laws to come in

4406
03:00:37,081 --> 03:00:40,670
with marijuana legalization,
get it does not allow for the spa

4407
03:00:40,671 --> 03:00:45,150
business man to have the type of
ingenuity is set up,

4408
03:00:45,151 --> 03:00:49,100
got a small liquor store had at the end
of prohibition or bar.

4409
03:00:49,110 --> 03:00:50,970
You know,
Jamie was telling me that in Ohio they

4410
03:00:50,971 --> 03:00:52,980
were setting it up.
So they were trying to make it legal,

4411
03:00:52,981 --> 03:00:55,980
but only two guys can grow it to
enormous corporations.

4412
03:00:56,010 --> 03:00:57,130
That was the bill,
right?

4413
03:00:57,160 --> 03:00:58,040
Is that how it worked?
Jamie,

4414
03:00:58,620 --> 03:01:00,230
I believe might've been four

4415
03:01:00,230 --> 03:01:01,300
or something like that.
Wasn't a lot,

4416
03:01:01,570 --> 03:01:03,540
some small amount of people.
They were the only ones who could.

4417
03:01:03,850 --> 03:01:04,683
I'm saying,
Bro,

4418
03:01:04,760 --> 03:01:06,190
we know,
we know that's fucked up.

4419
03:01:06,250 --> 03:01:08,140
That's so crazy.
That wouldn't even ask for them.

4420
03:01:08,170 --> 03:01:11,920
We notice fucked up when it should just
be your lab to grow it with a,

4421
03:01:12,250 --> 03:01:15,040
with $100 state,
federal tax,

4422
03:01:15,610 --> 03:01:18,430
state tax stamp,
you gotta stay tax to have 100 bucks.

4423
03:01:18,550 --> 03:01:21,970
You can grow up to three acres of
marijuana.

4424
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:22,840
Bam.
Love it,

4425
03:01:22,960 --> 03:01:24,910
love it,
perfect love you do your shit.

4426
03:01:25,120 --> 03:01:27,700
And then the growers have to buy from
you.

4427
03:01:27,701 --> 03:01:29,640
So if a farmer wants to make a
collective with,

4428
03:01:29,641 --> 03:01:31,780
for the farmers,
they are making that collective,

4429
03:01:31,781 --> 03:01:36,190
but we shouldn't be able to to,
to allow that type of domination because

4430
03:01:36,191 --> 03:01:38,110
essentially then you're just giving
people,

4431
03:01:38,350 --> 03:01:40,310
you know,
monopolies of sorts.

4432
03:01:40,840 --> 03:01:42,610
So it's,
it's like I just,

4433
03:01:42,611 --> 03:01:47,410
I don't trust us to,
to be on our shit enough with the people

4434
03:01:47,411 --> 03:01:48,244
we leave in charge.

4435
03:01:48,310 --> 03:01:49,540
Right.
Well it also,

4436
03:01:49,810 --> 03:01:51,970
it wouldn't make sense in any other
relationship.

4437
03:01:52,210 --> 03:01:56,260
And then the of the relationship are,
all someone is saying is if I let you

4438
03:01:56,261 --> 03:01:59,380
sell something,
you give me a certain percentage because

4439
03:01:59,381 --> 03:02:04,170
you're basically saying that all of the,
the frameworks of our government and the

4440
03:02:04,500 --> 03:02:08,440
the city's roads that you drive on and
all that stuff takes money to maintain.

4441
03:02:08,580 --> 03:02:12,520
So we're just going to take a little
piece now they'd take it 39% that's so

4442
03:02:12,521 --> 03:02:16,990
much.
But if that 39% went all to public

4443
03:02:16,991 --> 03:02:21,640
schools and paying teachers more money
and paying cops and paying firemen and

4444
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:24,640
community centers,
but beyond just pain,

4445
03:02:26,320 --> 03:02:29,620
good son of a former cop,
cousin of current cops,

4446
03:02:30,340 --> 03:02:35,340
policemen should be from areas that
they're policing or areas like those.

4447
03:02:36,550 --> 03:02:41,290
They should be offered no interest loans
to live at and around those communities,

4448
03:02:41,560 --> 03:02:44,290
teachers should be also,
and the fire department,

4449
03:02:44,470 --> 03:02:48,550
they should almost hold a special place
because of the nobility of those jobs

4450
03:02:48,730 --> 03:02:49,900
and how important they are.

4451
03:02:50,170 --> 03:02:53,290
We all should do stuff like tax freeze
is once you retire,

4452
03:02:53,440 --> 03:02:56,920
whatever your taxes are,
once you retire at 65 years old,

4453
03:02:57,070 --> 03:03:00,940
we should knock baby 10 20% off.
And that's what you pay until you die.

4454
03:03:00,970 --> 03:03:04,540
You know what I mean?
We should do everything we can to make

4455
03:03:04,580 --> 03:03:08,710
the the class of people you're saying
about affluence possible and we're not

4456
03:03:08,711 --> 03:03:11,620
doing it like that's,
I guess that's the only button I'm

4457
03:03:11,621 --> 03:03:14,320
pushing when I seen,
cause I'm a very optimistic person,

4458
03:03:14,321 --> 03:03:19,321
but my pessimism,
my pessimism comes more from the lack of

4459
03:03:19,511 --> 03:03:23,370
what I've seen us be willing to do to
make sure that one another treated

4460
03:03:23,380 --> 03:03:25,660
fairly then I have seen for.
Right.

4461
03:03:25,690 --> 03:03:28,690
You know what I'm saying?
Like I refuse to disavow.

4462
03:03:28,990 --> 03:03:31,180
You know what I mean?
Tuesday tends just an attitude though.

4463
03:03:31,181 --> 03:03:33,190
And that people evolve that attitude.
No.

4464
03:03:33,270 --> 03:03:37,060
We realize how important cooperation
really is a dewey though without being

4465
03:03:37,061 --> 03:03:38,410
attacked by all of us.

4466
03:03:39,220 --> 03:03:40,960
Some of us do.
Some of us do.

4467
03:03:40,961 --> 03:03:42,340
You do?
Absolutely.

4468
03:03:42,341 --> 03:03:43,180
Yeah.
And I do.

4469
03:03:43,230 --> 03:03:44,440
If there's,
there's people that do,

4470
03:03:44,500 --> 03:03:47,190
and it takes a hard,
it's a hard knock into your head to,

4471
03:03:47,490 --> 03:03:49,090
to really let it sink in.
Yeah.

4472
03:03:49,240 --> 03:03:52,000
But once you do let it sink in and you
live your life that way,

4473
03:03:52,450 --> 03:03:55,120
reciprocity and friendship for all and
camaraderie.

4474
03:03:55,121 --> 03:03:57,070
I'm so richer life,
it's a better life.

4475
03:03:57,110 --> 03:03:59,090
Absolutely.
The problem is people aren't taught,

4476
03:03:59,300 --> 03:04:01,140
they're not taught in enough.
They're not taught it in.

4477
03:04:01,141 --> 03:04:04,100
Men are taught to to face each other,
to hate each other and the hate on each

4478
03:04:04,101 --> 03:04:07,950
other and not look at each other in a
with a a famine mentality or a

4479
03:04:08,360 --> 03:04:10,910
mentality.
The lamest shit alive that is life.

4480
03:04:11,060 --> 03:04:13,070
The opposite is beautiful.
The obstacle.

4481
03:04:13,071 --> 03:04:16,720
You're uplifting people and like you,
you've give out 35 shoutouts.

4482
03:04:16,900 --> 03:04:19,370
Yeah,
positive dude.

4483
03:04:19,371 --> 03:04:20,510
That's what it's all about,
man.

4484
03:04:20,720 --> 03:04:22,820
That makes me feel better that it's
people like you out there.

4485
03:04:23,110 --> 03:04:26,240
It makes people feel better when they
listen to your music and they enjoy it.

4486
03:04:26,241 --> 03:04:29,210
That you're this guy behind it that's
not taking any of this for granted and

4487
03:04:29,211 --> 03:04:30,300
you're running with this shit.
Yeah,

4488
03:04:30,301 --> 03:04:31,430
absolutely.
I appreciate it.

4489
03:04:31,520 --> 03:04:32,660
Beautiful Man.
I love it.

4490
03:04:32,810 --> 03:04:35,810
Did we just did three hours?
It felt like three a good.

4491
03:04:35,811 --> 03:04:39,950
Three to
30 or 20 minutes.

4492
03:04:39,951 --> 03:04:42,350
It was incredible.
I was hanging in there tight.

4493
03:04:42,351 --> 03:04:42,950
Well,
listen man,

4494
03:04:42,950 --> 03:04:45,920
I'm a big fan.
I'm honored that you came down here and

4495
03:04:45,921 --> 03:04:47,840
did this.
It was beautiful for me.

4496
03:04:48,230 --> 03:04:49,880
I enjoyed it very much and I love you
shit.

4497
03:04:49,940 --> 03:04:53,330
I learned much to tell you a tell people
how to get you online.

4498
03:04:53,420 --> 03:04:54,980
