1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,870
The general good experience,
that's another thing you keep saying,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,090
aim low enough.
Have a low enough bar.

3
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:07,160
Why do you.
Why do you mean that?

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,940
Well,
let's say you've got a kid and you want

5
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:11,490
the kid to improve.
You don't set them a bar that's so high

6
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:13,290
that it's impossible for them to attain
it.

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,150
You take a look at the kid and you
think,

8
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:17,280
okay,
this kid's got this range of skill.

9
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,870
Here's a challenge we can throw at him
or her that exceeds their current level

10
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:24,570
of skill,
but gives them a reasonable probability

11
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:27,290
of success,
and so like I'm saying it tongue and

12
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:28,980
cheek to some degree,
you know it's like,

13
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,920
but if you're.
But I'm doing it as an aid to humility.

14
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:32,670
It's like,
well,

15
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,710
I don't know how to start improving my
life.

16
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,900
Someone might say that,
and I would say,

17
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,310
well,
you're not aiming low enough.

18
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,100
There's something you could do that you
are regarding as trivial that,

19
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:48,210
that you could do that you would do that
would result in an actual improvement,

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,220
but it's not a big enough improvement
for you.

21
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:53,160
So you won't lower yourself enough to
take the opportunity.

22
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,720
Incremental steps.
Yes.

23
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,630
And so this is also what is achieved
through exercise.

24
00:00:57,631 --> 00:00:58,840
It's one of the most important.
Yeah.

25
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,870
Well what do you do when you go and lift
weights?

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,090
You don't go in,
like if you have a bench press before

27
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:06,690
you don't put 400 pounds on the damn bar
and dropped and dropped the bar through

28
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,090
your skull.
You know,

29
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,120
you think,
look,

30
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:11,010
when I started working out,
when I was a kid,

31
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,770
I was,
I was weighed about 130 pounds and I was

32
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:16,140
six foot one was a thin kid and I smoked
a lot.

33
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:17,100
I wasn't in good shape.

34
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,760
I wasn't in good physical shape and I
went to the gym and it was bloody

35
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:21,570
embarrassing,
you know,

36
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,750
when people would come over and help me
with the goddamn weights,

37
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,890
here's how you're supposed to use this.
You know,

38
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:30,330
it was humiliating and maybe I was
pressing 65 pounds or something at that

39
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:31,470
point,
you know,

40
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:34,440
but what am I going to do?
I'm going to lift up 150 pounds and

41
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:36,570
injure myself right off the bat.
No,

42
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:40,200
I had to go in there and strip down and
put my skinny God damn self in front of

43
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:43,590
the mirror and think son of a bitch.
There's all these monsters in the gym

44
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:47,220
would be lifting weights for 10 years
and I'm struggling to get 50 pounds off

45
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:49,080
the bar.
Tough luck for me,

46
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,820
but I could lift 50 pounds and it wasn't
very long until I could lift 75 and

47
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,271
well,
you know,

48
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:55,590
how it goes,
but.

49
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,520
And I never injured myself when I was
weight lifting and the reason for that

50
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:04,380
was I never pushed myself past where I
knew I could go and I pushed myself a

51
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:05,190
lot.
You know,

52
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,670
I gained 35 pounds of muscle in about
three years in university.

53
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,070
I kind of had to quit because I was
eating so God damn much.

54
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:13,680
I couldn't stand it seeming like six
meals a day.

55
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:17,580
It was just taken up too much time,
but there's a humility in determining

56
00:02:17,581 --> 00:02:21,060
what it is that the wretched creature
that you are can actually manage.

57
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,450
Aim Low,
and I don't mean don't aim and I don't

58
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:29,451
mean don't aim up,
but you have to accept the fact that you

59
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:33,120
can set yourself a goal that you can
attain and there's not going to be much

60
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:36,480
glory in it to begin with because if
you're not in very good shape,

61
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,350
the goal that you could they could
attain tomorrow isn't very glorious,

62
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,890
but it it's a hell of a lot better than
nothing and it beats the hell out of

63
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:46,350
bitterness and it's way better than
blaming someone else.

64
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,490
It's way less dangerous and you could do
it and what's cool about it,

65
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,640
there's a statement in the New
Testament,

66
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,330
it's called the matthew principle,
and economists use it to describe how

67
00:02:57,331 --> 00:03:00,850
the economy in the world works to those
who have everything more will be given

68
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,890
from those who have nothing.
Everything will be taken.

69
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,400
It's like what's very pessimistic in
some sense because it means that as you

70
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:08,590
start to fail,
you fail more and more rapidly,

71
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,380
but it also means that as you start to
succeed,

72
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,850
you succeed more and more rapidly,
and so you take an incremental step and

73
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,750
well,
now you can lift 55 pounds instead of 52

74
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:21,010
point five pounds.
You think,

75
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:21,970
well,
what the hell is that?

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,070
It's like it's one step on a very long
journey and so it's,

77
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,430
and it starts to compound on you.
So a small step today means puts you in

78
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:33,310
a position to take a slightly bigger
step the next day,

79
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:36,550
and then that puts you in a position to
take a slightly bigger step the next

80
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:36,550
day.

81
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,530
And you do that for two or three years.
Man,

82
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:43,531
you're starting to stride everyone who's
fighting in these older leagues or if

83
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:44,770
they,
if golden boy,

84
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:46,090
if that's your thing,
to do like these,

85
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,300
this master league,
everyone fighting that lead better.

86
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,810
Pray to the MMA.
God's Vituro Balfour does not enter that

87
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:54,220
fucking thing.
Juice to the gills.

88
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,500
Oh,
have you seen lately?

89
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,490
Yes.
You better looks amazing.

90
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,020
Fantastic.
So happy we will.

91
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:03,370
We'll kick the fuck out of all those old
dudes at the same time.

92
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:04,430
He really.
Well Dude,

93
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,040
I was looking at his instagram the other
day.

94
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,420
I was like,
oh my God.

95
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:09,490
Yeah,
there's something happens to veto or

96
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:12,040
when he fills up with super unleaded
dude,

97
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,580
it's like butter and Jelly.
He's a different roads bro.

98
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:16,540
Like some people don't.
Don't,

99
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,400
don't do well with Roy to get all red
and shit.

100
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,480
He looks great.

101
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,820
His skin's vibrant,
his tits are popping.

102
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:26,200
All Tans teeth get wider.
He's doing straight testosterone.

103
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,140
He's not mean when he was on.
See,

104
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:30,100
think about this,
right?

105
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,730
We know for sure.
We all know absolutely 100 percent of

106
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,880
the people have cheated and taking
steroids and got away with it.

107
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,200
We know that.
I know.

108
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,420
You know that.
Especially in fighting,

109
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,140
especially when the weigh ins were the
only day you had a pee and there was no

110
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:45,310
randoms.
That didn't just come by.

111
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:50,311
We know for a fact,
but when you watch someone who's just

112
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:55,771
doing testosterone and what else is
doing with human growth hormone and

113
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,720
fucking gigantic now.
I love that.

114
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,300
I love it too,
but what you get there,

115
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,410
it's a different thing like for
Vittorio,

116
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,620
like something happens with him,
like when you,

117
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,820
when they allowed him to take it,
like during the rockhold fight and

118
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,990
bisping fight dude,
his body,

119
00:05:11,991 --> 00:05:14,770
he ate it up,
but that's kind of a different thing.

120
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,590
First of all,
under control.

121
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:22,591
I was always a happy kid but not really
because I was always confused about the

122
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:26,610
death of my father so I'd always have
happiness,

123
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,850
but I always had the Catholic faith.
I was raised Catholic.

124
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,320
I always believed he wasn't having that.
He was in that box from my mom did the

125
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:38,620
things,
so these the pain a little bit.

126
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:43,621
Then my mother's death was just fuck it,
and that broke the central nervous

127
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:50,371
system belief system
that broke your belief in the world.

128
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,790
How can there be a god that takes a
mugger away from a child

129
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,190
when you're 16 and you wrap that around?
Your head does not a good result.

130
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:06,140
It's not going to be a good result.
So how I lashed out was by robin you.

131
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,920
That was the only weapon I had was to
rob you.

132
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,660
Joe Rogan fucked me.

133
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,480
This studio would get robbed and living
on fucking fire and Joe knew was and

134
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,510
what the fuck was he going to do?
I'm with Columbine.

135
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,930
The fuck you going to do it?
Call the cops.

136
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,270
It's Karma.
Going to answer the phone next time.

137
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:25,940
Don't fuck with me.
You'll know next time.

138
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:29,900
Not The fuck I tell you to give me that
gram of coke and I'll pay you on Friday.

139
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:31,310
You'll fucking give it to me,
right?

140
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,950
Because that's what it was.
It was simple shit like that.

141
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,151
Like,
Joe,

142
00:06:35,151 --> 00:06:37,670
give me 100 bucks.
I broke $100 bucks.

143
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,120
Okay,
now rob,

144
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,420
your fucking house should have gave me
the hundred bucks.

145
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,060
You know,
I was lashing out of the fucking world.

146
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,410
Number two.
The other issue I had is I lost a child.

147
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,060
I loved the job.
I was not ready for that child at all.

148
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:54,950
I love that little girl with all my
heart,

149
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:57,320
but I was not ready for her at all.

150
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,100
My intentions are good,
but the result was not going to be well.

151
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:06,101
I was not ready and because I lost that
child and I'm a no contact with that

152
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:09,290
child,
it makes me a better father than I am

153
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,660
today.
This is never going to happen to me

154
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:13,400
again.
You understand me?

155
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,460
I see.
I see the,

156
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:21,790
we see daughters of comics,
we've seen daughters of comics,

157
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:27,300
comics and if fucking lost,
you know,

158
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,110
I don't want my daughter to be fucking
lost.

159
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,600
And that stupidity in the net world,
you know,

160
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,510
you have to be that.
We have to be there

161
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,860
dealing cocaine.
Oh good.

162
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,060
Like to that vest story man.
So here's what happened.

163
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,400
So I,
you know,

164
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:46,130
I would get using cocaine at thousand,
put on these different vests.

165
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,950
How many did you buy it again?
I don't know.

166
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:51,860
I spent too much on them,
but I would probably say

167
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,360
the price.
Yes.

168
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,540
One I had was probably about 200.
$10.

169
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,330
90.
Damn.

170
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,560
Yeah.
And so I would get fucked up and put

171
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:04,190
these vests on and put on sunglasses and
not let them know like Buffalo Bill

172
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,570
Shit.
But at least party and by myself,

173
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,910
you know.
And one time I was making a smoothie,

174
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:08,601
you know,
because I,

175
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:09,434
you know,
I have,

176
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,660
I got like a new unknown what kind of or
it is,

177
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:14,530
but it's pretty nice and I was making
like a nice smooth,

178
00:08:14,531 --> 00:08:16,490
you know,
I'm fucking coked up on partying and you

179
00:08:16,491 --> 00:08:19,340
know,
living high on the hog to vests on

180
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:19,610
maybe.

181
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,450
Right.
And I thought,

182
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,000
I thought I heard something outside.
Right.

183
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:26,390
Which is kind of weird to even think of
when you have a blender going,

184
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:28,460
right?
So I'll leave out of my apartment to go

185
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:32,060
in the hallway,
lock myself out with the blender going

186
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,930
in the morning,
coked up out of my brain.

187
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:41,390
Now I have to go to my landlord dude who
lives right down the hall and tell him

188
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:43,430
like,
hey man,

189
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,350
I got logged out Glenda's on.
Oh my God,

190
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:51,830
he must have hated you.
Owe the blender shorts out and smoke

191
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:55,140
happens.
The fire alarm starts going off in the

192
00:08:55,141 --> 00:08:57,660
building,
right as I'm at his door knocking right

193
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,670
now.
He's pissed and he's like,

194
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:02,220
what's going on?
And I didn't know what to say.

195
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:05,810
I told him that I was throwing a late
Christmas party.

196
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,870
It was fucking into January.
I will with you at the time.

197
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:11,730
Huh?
Oh,

198
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,450
this is two and a half years ago.
So was 30,

199
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,193
35.

200
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,060
So he comes back to my apartment,
right?

201
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,460
He's,
he unlocks the door.

202
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,880
There's nobody in there.
Oh my God.

203
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,401
I'm like,
man,

204
00:09:30,401 --> 00:09:32,140
but that's it.
It was fun.

205
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,060
Oh my God.
No,

206
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,020
that was fun.
How long had you lived there for?

207
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,120
I still live there.
Yeah,

208
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,620
we've passionate,
you know,

209
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:48,630
like I've caught him doing some things.
I think we're all even.

210
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,580
How long have you been sober?
For?

211
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,950
Two year.
In two weeks it'll be two years.

212
00:09:55,951 --> 00:09:57,990
What was the big thing where you like,
oh,

213
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,010
I gotta get my shit together.
You Die.

214
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,830
What was going on?
Opion Jim,

215
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:06,030
when Opie and Jim Norton had a radio
show at serious and it was actually on

216
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,000
a,
it's on [inaudible] that show that he

217
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:10,170
had.
This is not happening.

218
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,340
And I ended up,
uh,

219
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,680
doing coke all night driving a taxi.
I was in a taxi.

220
00:10:16,681 --> 00:10:18,900
The driver is due to Luigi.

221
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,660
Um,
got me an escort.

222
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,110
I didn't want to escort,
we're doing cocaine and like Harlem or

223
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:28,920
something north,
the cab driver doing coke and I just

224
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,810
had,
I was taking a cab from a party to my

225
00:10:30,811 --> 00:10:34,200
hotel and so we ended up off on this
other excursion.

226
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,270
Next thing you know,
I'm driving the taxi.

227
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:39,870
He's in the back with the hooker.
It's 5:30 in the morning and I got to be

228
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:43,020
on the radio station at 6:30 or
something.

229
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,540
So I get to the radio and I can't even
talk.

230
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,590
And uh,
and darryl strawberry's the other guest,

231
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,890
right?
Who's the baseball player who also had

232
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,920
drug problem,
but he's like 13 years sober.

233
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,860
And so it was this weird moment where
like,

234
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,090
I thought I was kind of cool,
but then here's a man who like,

235
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,120
I'd always in my head maybe somewhere
thought,

236
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,580
oh,
that guy's like a cokehead within here.

237
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,710
He is eloquent,
put together,

238
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:10,470
successful in here I am,
I can't even talk.

239
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,240
And I'm with two men that I admire.
Um,

240
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,310
you know,
opie and Jim Norton,

241
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:16,380
just to be honored to be on the show,
you know.

242
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:17,490
And so I was like,
this is,

243
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,680
I'm,
I'm not making choices.

244
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:21,750
Like there's some,
there's some unevenness here,

245
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,270
you know.
And so what did you do after the 2012

246
00:11:24,271 --> 00:11:25,800
step program?
12 step program.

247
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:28,350
Yeah.
And then so yeah.

248
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:30,360
So I've been in that.
Then since then it has helped me out,

249
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:30,840
you know.
