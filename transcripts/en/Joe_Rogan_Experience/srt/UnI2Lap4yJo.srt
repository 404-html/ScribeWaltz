1
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,480
Boom,
and we're alive.

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,050
Jamie,
where'd you get that awesome shirt.

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:11,960
Show everybody.
Your Shark tank.

4
00:00:11,961 --> 00:00:12,940
You show the people.
You're sure.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,370
I picked it up yesterday.
It says,

6
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:15,870
believe,
believe that.

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,750
Believe that from the hundreds that saw 
the story yesterday.

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,270
What is the hundreds?
100.

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,650
Does a streetwear brand started?
Fairfax.

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,060
I thought it was like a scene in a 
movie.

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,770
I was confused.
Oh.

12
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:27,330
So I just saw and I was like,
oh dope.

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,240
Yeah.
I mean that's a combination of that girl

14
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:34,630
who was on Dr Phil Show and Ufo Sorta.
Yeah,

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,850
yeah,
yeah.

16
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,810
Take the lead dad [inaudible] like 
believe,

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,290
believe is so x files the year to 1999 
or whatever it was like when was the x 

18
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,110
files on?
It's on now,

19
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,090
but when,
but when was the original one?

20
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:52,860
Yeah,
late nineties.

21
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:57,600
Mid Nineties I believe is that.
Does that poster and I always just.

22
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,680
You can't disconnect them from the Po,
the poster and molders office,

23
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,070
but believed that that's today.

24
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,670
Nailed it.
Even whoever made that shirt,

25
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,210
I want to believe that's a cool shirt.
Is it?

26
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:15,990
I want to believe that would have seen 
on the poster believed that's better,

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,660
but I do want to believe of all the 
things of all the stupid things.

28
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,170
I would love to believe that someone 
like got real footage of Ufo is like 

29
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,341
more than almost any other weird like 
big foot type,

30
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,790
loch ness,
monster,

31
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:37,791
all the really nutty shit.
If they could find out one of those was 

32
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:37,791
true fucking aliens,
number one,

33
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,060
right?
For sure.

34
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,300
Even if you just knew for sure that you 
saw a real ship or if the aliens looked 

35
00:01:44,431 --> 00:01:48,450
like a big foot,
then you kill two birds with one stone.

36
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,960
That was the actual theory.
Ah,

37
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,990
some of these big foot people are so.
There's spectrums of big foot people,

38
00:01:57,991 --> 00:01:59,490
man.
This big foot people.

39
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,530
There's people that are like real 
primatologists,

40
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:05,460
like Jane Goodall.
Jane Goodall believes in bigfoot.

41
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,070
Believe it or not.
It's really fascinating.

42
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:12,780
There's a whole interview with her where
she says she's sure of it.

43
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,480
She said she sure that there's another 
species.

44
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,880
How can she be sure?
Let's play the clip,

45
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:19,800
see if we can find that clip.
Um,

46
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,550
who's Jane Goodall is a world famous 
primatologist who did some 

47
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,920
groundbreaking work with chimpanzees.
She essentially live with chimpanzees.

48
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,660
She's so powerful.
I mean,

49
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:33,330
this lady is amazing if he watched her 
documentaries.

50
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,480
So when someone like her says something 
like that,

51
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:37,110
I'm like,
okay,

52
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,020
well I should shut the fuck up and stay 
in my lane.

53
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,320
What am I to argue with Jane Goodall 
about primates?

54
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,680
And it used to be a real thing.
They used to really be a gigantic topic 

55
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,641
is an eight foot tall orangutang like 
thing that probably walked on two legs 

56
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,990
and she believes it's real.

57
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,320
She thinks it did exist or she thinks 
that links it exists right now.

58
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,620
Wow.
Yeah.

59
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,100
Wow.
I don't think it was taken out of 

60
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,170
context because I'm pretty sure it was,
um,

61
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,400
someone asked her a question and then 
she gave a long and detailed answer 

62
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,290
based on what we know about certain 
chimpanzee subspecies that are really,

63
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:19,180
really hard to find.
Like we're just finding out.

64
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:21,610
I think they figured it out from like 
the 19 nineties.

65
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,570
There's a giant version of chimpanzees 
that lives in the Congo.

66
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:31,020
It's what they call them a Bondo apes or
there's a couple different names for 

67
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,230
them.
They call them,

68
00:03:31,231 --> 00:03:32,920
but they sleep on the ground like 
gorillas.

69
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,200
They're giant chimps who love that 
stuff.

70
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,980
I watch planet earth to the other day 
just mesmerized,

71
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:41,320
just physically saying like,
wow,

72
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:46,950
wow.
I don't think a normal person 

73
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:47,890
understands what you're talking about 
when you say a six foot tall chimp.

74
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,660
Yeah.
I just don't think they know what you're

75
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:54,661
talking about.
You're talking about like a super 

76
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:54,661
gorilla.
It's like not.

77
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:59,070
It's,
it's way scarier than a gorilla because 

78
00:03:59,070 --> 00:03:59,320
they're their chimps.
Chimps are scarier.

79
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:00,860
Chimps are predators.
Yeah.

80
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,050
Chimps eat monkeys,
man.

81
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,760
I mean they,
they.

82
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,890
People want associate chimps with 
bananas and nuts and stuff like that and

83
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,750
they eat that stuff too,
but they also eat monkeys.

84
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,430
Scary dude.
They're.

85
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:18,460
They're ruthless motherfuckers.
What does this buddies from MPR 

86
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,020
conversation?
You can find the actual recording 

87
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,020
because it's fascinating when you hear 
the tone of her voice.

88
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,340
She says something like,
I'm sure of it.

89
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,180
She has this super powerful voice.
This.

90
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:31,000
I mean,
this lady is a fucking biologists,

91
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,160
bad ass.
She's living with chimps.

92
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:35,440
Man.
Just hanging out with them constantly.

93
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,920
You know what kind of a human being you 
have to be to be able to keep your shit 

94
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,970
together and a tribe of wild chimps 
where they accept you.

95
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,960
They don't just smash your fucking head 
in for a goof.

96
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,700
That is crazy.
Come on man.

97
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,250
Well here's.
This is the transcription,

98
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:56,380
but I'm pretty sure it's a soundbite 
here,

99
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:57,820
but there's no link or anything.
Oh,

100
00:04:57,821 --> 00:05:00,850
I know it exists to try and find it on 
youtube maybe.

101
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,000
Alright.
Shit.

102
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:03,360
Well,
what did,

103
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,510
what did she say there?
Well,

104
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,210
well now you'll be amazed when I tell 
you that.

105
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:08,680
I'm sure that they exist.
Yeah,

106
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,790
yeah.
That's what it was.

107
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,530
That's how she said it.
Well,

108
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:15,340
now you will be amazed when I tell you 
that I'm sure that they exist.

109
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,660
That's basically how she said it.
Did you always believe that they 

110
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:21,660
existed?
She says,

111
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,990
well,
I'm a romantic,

112
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:25,570
so I always wanted that and there you 
have it,

113
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:25,870
blah,
blah,

114
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:26,170
blah,
blah,

115
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:28,690
blah.
Where does it say about evidence?

116
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,340
She's also talking to Dr Meldrum who you
talk to here.

117
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,780
We had Dr Meldrum.
What is his full name?

118
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,230
Jeffrey Jeffrey Meldrum and he's a 
professor,

119
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:41,010
right?
I think he brought in the big foot foot.

120
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,840
He was the guy.
Dr Meldrum was a really nice guy.

121
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,280
We also said he'd be willing to cut off 
a finger to know that big foot was real.

122
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,420
I'm like,
Whoa,

123
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,390
Whoa,
Whoa,

124
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,370
whoa.
Like what finger?

125
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,070
Pinky.
Pinky.

126
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,140
Which one would.
Which one would you go with?

127
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,250
Pinky.
No,

128
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,980
because you'd want the

129
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,430
pinky because that's the farthest 
leverage to the other side of the thumb.

130
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:02,960
Right.
So it's sort of like a claw,

131
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,000
maybe the ring finger.
That's a good point.

132
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,250
The middle finger seems pretty 
pointless.

133
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,690
Yeah.
This is the interview,

134
00:06:10,691 --> 00:06:12,280
but I don't know where in the interview 
it is.

135
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:12,890
Oh,
okay.

136
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,240
My perspective,
I guess just considering the.

137
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,170
You're going to be amazed when I tell 
you.

138
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,650
I'm sure they exist.
It's like a scene in a movie when she 

139
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,610
says it because here she is this 
esteemed scientist.

140
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,530
Right.
And you're expecting,

141
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,430
well there's no evidence and right now 
that's just.

142
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:38,610
We think of it as legend and could 
possibly be a bunch of different things 

143
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:38,610
that people think they saw

144
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:43,150
voice and delivery's important when it 
comes to being convinced of something 

145
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:43,560
you think about,
like,

146
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:48,561
you know,
all the way to just comedians being 

147
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:48,561
anything.
Chappelle's voice.

148
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:50,700
If you look at the transcript of what 
Chappelle saying at times,

149
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:54,690
I'm sure it's not that insane,
but you listen to him say those things.

150
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,370
Singles who?
Joey Diaz.

151
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,540
Oh yeah.
For sure.

152
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,320
You know,

153
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:03,690
and when it's coming from a scientist 
with long gray hair who lives with 

154
00:07:05,681 --> 00:07:06,310
chimps,

155
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,720
she must be amy.
And you think she's hooked up with the 

156
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:11,720
champ?
I mean,

157
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,790
all those come on chance.
She lives with all of them.

158
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:14,960
Yeah.

159
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,220
Wow.

160
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,910
It sounds like there's some monkey 
business going on.

161
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,720
It didn't help me.
I didn't even mean set it up.

162
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,240
Here it is.

163
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:23,780
Nine,
eight,

164
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,220
nine,
eight,

165
00:07:24,221 --> 00:07:24,640
two,
five,

166
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:24,880
five.

167
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,090
Yeah.
Hi.

168
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,300
How you doing?
I'm wondering to if you believed her at 

169
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:33,790
any undiscovered large APP.
Here it is.

170
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:39,020
A yeti or big photos.
Nothing message I'm missing here are 

171
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,950
pretty much out of the loop.
Well,

172
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,480
now you will be amazed when I tell you 
that I'm.

173
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,470
I'm sure that they are.
Yeah.

174
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:56,700
I've talked to so many native Americans 
who described the same songs to who's 

175
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:01,620
seen them.
I've probably got about 30 books that 

176
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,950
have come from different parts of the 
world,

177
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,780
from China,
from,

178
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,030
from all over the place.
You always have this belief that they're

179
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:12,150
debating that big of a romantic one too.
All right Jerry.

180
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,290
Thank you.
Thanks for calling.

181
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,500
She probably knows more than me,
so you know if you can.

182
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,720
When in doubt go with the person knows 
more than you,

183
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:28,930
but I've never.
I've never seen any like real evidence 

184
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,820
other than these footprint things.
I mean everything else is just bullshit.

185
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,920
They find hair turns out to be bear 
here.

186
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,390
They find scat.
Turns out to be like a wolf scat.

187
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,870
Where did they find the footprints at?
How they find them everywhere,

188
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:43,871
man,
but you don't know what you're looking 

189
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:43,871
at.
You know,

190
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:47,470
it could be anything.
Could be someone decided to fake 

191
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,860
footprints.
You know,

192
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,620
it could be a big bear that's less 
likely,

193
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,890
but it depends on the area.
Like a big grizzly bear print,

194
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,080
who knows?
I mean he would.

195
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,540
It took to make it look already human 
foot.

196
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:06,230
It would after either be a giant human 
foot or be just incredible special 

197
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:09,180
effects.

198
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,720
It's one or two things.
Some of them when they got like ridges,

199
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:17,260
they've found like dermal ridges that 
indicate a.

200
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,280
They think it indicates a footprint type
thing,

201
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,980
but with the,
with the feet of these things,

202
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:28,020
they seem to think that that somehow or 
another makes it very,

203
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:33,170
very difficult to fake.
But people want to believe that shit.

204
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:36,930
That's part of the problem.
Part of the problem is it's fun.

205
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,380
It's super fun to believe that someone's
not fucking with you,

206
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:45,270
but that's some big giant monkey just 
walked through with every day,

207
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:49,410
every passing minute of every day.
It becomes way less likely that that's a

208
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:54,411
real thing because there's so many 
people with cameras and these people go 

209
00:09:54,411 --> 00:09:54,420
deep into the woods

210
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,830
and I think it's also like one of the 
cooler things to believe in because it's

211
00:09:59,831 --> 00:10:01,110
not,
you know.

212
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:03,630
Yeah man,
be even if they did exist,

213
00:10:03,631 --> 00:10:08,080
like we have guns and shit.
Whereas like if aliens existed were

214
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,070
fucked.
Yeah,

215
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:14,170
we're fucked navy.
So we're sort of rooting for the 

216
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,890
sasquatches in the world.
What of all the look,

217
00:10:15,891 --> 00:10:20,891
there had to be a bunch of different 
kinds of human being like creatures that

218
00:10:20,931 --> 00:10:25,220
existed is it just only makes sense.
They're finding new ones all that time.

219
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,640
They're like constantly finding some new
subspecies of people that they weren't 

220
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,421
aware of before.
It's super possible that something grew 

221
00:10:34,421 --> 00:10:38,620
to be like that.
Like why wouldn't it be if we can get a 

222
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:38,620
chance?
Why?

223
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:43,090
Why is that so weird?
Like it's not any weirder than a person 

224
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:43,460
or a chimp.
Both of those things are way weirder.

225
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,900
Like we found another person.
We'd be like,

226
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,030
Holy Shit,
look what it's done.

227
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:52,180
Like if we could,
we poked our head into some other 

228
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:52,180
dimension,
right?

229
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,710
And we just stuck our head through and 
we saw the impact of a human 

230
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,970
civilization on the natural world.

231
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,220
We'd be like,
what the fuck?

232
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,400
That's way crazier than bigfoot.
Like a human being is making tubes out 

233
00:11:06,951 --> 00:11:11,840
of aluminum with giant wings and 
shooting itself into the sky and landing

234
00:11:11,841 --> 00:11:16,841
on different spots.
It's sucking oil out of the ground and 

235
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:19,070
using it to build everything.
It's talking on vine and it goes through

236
00:11:19,071 --> 00:11:24,071
the air and winds up on your phone.
All this is done by a human that's way 

237
00:11:24,071 --> 00:11:25,160
crazier.
The big foot.

238
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,760
That's fucking crazy.
Then you go to chimps.

239
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,090
Chimps are way crazier than bigfoot.
They're hot and monkeys,

240
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:35,000
man.
They're fucking forming little societies

241
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:36,860
together.
Some of them are figuring out how to use

242
00:11:36,861 --> 00:11:41,640
tools and they're right there like 
that's way crazier than bigfoot.

243
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:47,140
Bigfoot's just a shy guy.
He just wants to be alone and just let 

244
00:11:48,231 --> 00:11:51,890
him find a good place to shit.
You can't find any big foot shed because

245
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,430
he's always paranoid that people were 
watching them.

246
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,170
So he's holding his shit in it.

247
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,650
I think Jane Goodall's wrong on this 
one.

248
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,960
I'm going to be honest with you.
I don't know where,

249
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,450
but I'm going to go out there off on a 
limb

250
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,630
that is limb.
That's quite a limb,

251
00:12:06,631 --> 00:12:08,970
sir.
Why would you think that she would think

252
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,680
it's real?
Because she wants it to be real.

253
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,500
Yeah,
and you know,

254
00:12:12,501 --> 00:12:16,140
she said that she was talking to native 
Americans about it and you know,

255
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,180
they're like,
you know,

256
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,880
they,
they go off on a little bit trippy.

257
00:12:19,881 --> 00:12:20,860
Right,
right.

258
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,050
They might be sent to jail.
Yeah.

259
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,240
Who knows,
you know,

260
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,980
just like saying you talked to to native
Americans.

261
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:29,830
It's like saying I talked to white 
people like,

262
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:36,050
you know,
just because they happen to be native 

263
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:36,050
Americans.
Like they got street cred for big foot.

264
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:36,300
She's what she's saying.
She's,

265
00:12:36,301 --> 00:12:37,050
yeah,
she's,

266
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,590
she's made an appointment.
Native Americans bigfoot street cred.

267
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,150
It's closer to the sasquatch.
They named it.

268
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,930
It's like if anybody knows about almost 
going extinct,

269
00:12:48,931 --> 00:12:52,490
it should be state of California sued 
because it won't recognize it is

270
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,070
bigfoot.
Is this,

271
00:12:54,071 --> 00:12:55,370
is this today?
Yeah.

272
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:00,130
This last lawsuit,
that's what that is city going on here.

273
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:05,370
There's a lot of people in this country 
who claimed to believe the existence of 

274
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:08,911
big foot,
but one California woman believes it's 

275
00:13:08,911 --> 00:13:10,971
so strongly in the beast.
She's actually filed a lawsuit to prove 

276
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:14,761
it.
Could you imagine being the court 

277
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,711
systems all choked up with divorce and 
corruption and tax evasion and whatever 

278
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:22,270
the fuck else they investigate,
and this crazy lady like,

279
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,600
I'm silly.
I've got a team of lawyers.

280
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:28,210
We're taking the whole state down.
We're taking the whole state down.

281
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:33,330
They won't recognize sasquatch.
We won't recognize them and she's just 

282
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,960
going to town getting crazy.
She makes a Gofund me and big foot 

283
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,420
people.
They're like super pumped.

284
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:39,400
When there's some action,
something's happening.

285
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,310
They'll fucking donate to that.
Go Fund me a little bit here,

286
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,230
a little bit here and a lot of big foot 
lovers out there.

287
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,620
This chick would be fighting the 
government video.

288
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,940
Imagine the lawyer that takes that case 
like,

289
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,590
is this a video of her with bigfoot?
Yeah.

290
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:58,591
She said it was 30 feet up into a tree.
It seems real where these people are 

291
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,130
just wonderful people that really,
really,

292
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:06,820
really,
really,

293
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:07,540
really,
really,

294
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:10,690
really want big foot to exist and when 
you really,

295
00:14:10,691 --> 00:14:11,350
really,
really,

296
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,220
really,
really,

297
00:14:12,221 --> 00:14:15,250
really,
really want big foot to exist,

298
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,340
you sort of figure out a way to make 
them exist in your mind.

299
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,060
There's no evidence.
The problem is there's nothing.

300
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:26,550
There's no footprints that are like a 
attached to hair.

301
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,820
You know,
where you could get like a little bit of

302
00:14:27,821 --> 00:14:29,050
hair off of it and say,
Oh,

303
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,080
well this is definitely a primate.
Does none of that.

304
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:33,040
They have dental,
have any of that.

305
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,810
They have these mushy footprints that 
people have made in the month.

306
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,740
They impossible to fake.
Maybe.

307
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,800
I don't know.
I don't know if they're impossible to 

308
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,481
fake,
but I do know that I haven't seen one 

309
00:14:45,481 --> 00:14:46,150
picture that looks real.
I've seen one video.

310
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,530
Everything just smells like bullshit.
Yeah,

311
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:53,850
the pee p,
the problem always have with it is it 

312
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:54,650
always looks like a man in a suit and 
here's the thing.

313
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:58,850
The only thing that looks like a man in 
a suit as a man in a suit like this,

314
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,370
even a chip doesn't look like a man in a
suit.

315
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:06,430
They moved different men.
Chimps Kinda like throw themselves with 

316
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:06,950
their arms and up.
They moved.

317
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,560
If you can't move like that,
you can't move like that.

318
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:15,280
You could try.
You're not going to be able to move the 

319
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:15,280
way a chimp modes,
especially with chimps moving fast.

320
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,930
Just get the fuck outta here.
It's not even close.

321
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,750
You look like a guy pretending to be a 
chimp.

322
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,380
You're moving like a guy.
All these things move like people.

323
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:29,470
They move like people like your brain,
a little computer in your brain that 

324
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:29,470
recognize the shapes goes,
oh,

325
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:29,990
that's a guy in a monkey suit.

326
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,560
Yeah.
Right.

327
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,510
Yeah.
Instantly.

328
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,890
That's exactly what you think because it
is that one,

329
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,540
the famous one that we know that one was
a guy in a suit,

330
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,710
right?
Well,

331
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,970
there's people that dispute it,
but that's the patterson footage.

332
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:51,290
The Patterson footage is like the most 
famous footage and all of bigfoot lore 

333
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:56,190
because this guy who I'm pretty sure the
guy was a.

334
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,660
He was arrested for something like,
for not pay.

335
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:06,090
I believe it was something like not 
paying for the very camera that he used 

336
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,390
to film the big foot footage.
Wow.

337
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,060
Arrested for it.
So the guy,

338
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,840
he's stealing cameras,
right?

339
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,300
Dad's not good.
Right.

340
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,670
And then there's another guy who claims 
that he wore the suit.

341
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,500
What the fuck is that guy's name?
I always forget that guys name Gimlet is

342
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:26,440
the guy that was there and then there 
was the other guy who wore the suit,

343
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,640
who's a large fellow

344
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,280
and there's a picture of him walking 
like he.

345
00:16:32,281 --> 00:16:37,281
He showed how he did it and he walked 
and then you see on the other side of 

346
00:16:37,281 --> 00:16:41,501
the screen,
the guy in the monkey suit doing the 

347
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:41,501
exact same walkin hieronymus Bob,
Bob,

348
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,940
Bob Ross.
That's it.

349
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:47,941
Yeah.
Now I remember Bob Hieronymus who's a 

350
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:49,040
big cowboy looking dude,
and they had him walk with a monkey suit

351
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,910
on and everybody was like,
that's real big foot footage.

352
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,010
This guy bought a monkey suit too,
by the way.

353
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,480
The guy who made the film,
he had bought a monkey suit.

354
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:04,750
Wow.
And he said he was going to use the 

355
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:04,750
monkey suit to like,
you know,

356
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,020
film a reenactment.
So practice filming with it or something

357
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:11,021
like that.
Some cockamamie reason for having a 

358
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:12,590
monkey suit.
The whole thing is so stupid.

359
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,990
It's if you look at all the pieces 
involved,

360
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:15,680
you're like,
oh yeah,

361
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:18,170
you guys were fucking around and you 
know,

362
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,280
you filmed some shit while you were on a
horse,

363
00:17:20,281 --> 00:17:25,281
so it was all bouncy.
You see this thing walk her across the 

364
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:27,701
street,
but now they can isolate that footage 

365
00:17:27,701 --> 00:17:27,860
because it used to be all bouncing shaky
with computers.

366
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:32,810
They can isolate it and get it all into 
one flat plane and you watch it move.

367
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,840
It's a fucking guy and a monkey.
So 100 percent.

368
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,760
Right.
You've seen it.

369
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,890
How have you seen it?
Yeah.

370
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,700
Watch that shit.
You Go,

371
00:17:43,701 --> 00:17:45,680
what am I looking at?
What are you doing here?

372
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,770
It's crazy,
but people want to believe so bad.

373
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,430
Yeah.
I've never

374
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,590
had a chance of believing in the,
uh,

375
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,860
in the whole big foot thing.
It was always just silly to me.

376
00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:00,890
I remember,
was it John Lithgow and Harry and the 

377
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:00,890
Hendersons back in the day or something 
like that?

378
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:01,230
Yeah,
yeah.

379
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,260
I grew up on that and I was just stories
like,

380
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,920
ah,
it's like a fake character.

381
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,980
It's like,
I think it'd be see Harry and the 

382
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:09,980
hendersons before finding out about big 
foot.

383
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:13,710
It's like believing that Barney,
the dinosaur would exist out there.

384
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:18,930
Only reason to give it any credence at 
all is the vast expanse of wilderness 

385
00:18:20,591 --> 00:18:24,850
that exists in the Pacific northwest 
because it's so lush.

386
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:29,140
It's so crazy that no one's getting in 
there and figuring out exactly what's in

387
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,450
there.
Like every I.

388
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:34,730
I really think everyone who lives in 
this area,

389
00:18:34,731 --> 00:18:36,550
especially because you.
You'd get up there pretty quick,

390
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,540
but anybody anywhere should go to the 
Pacific northwest.

391
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,580
I go to the mountains right above 
Seattle.

392
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,070
That's a crazy place,
man.

393
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,620
That was way crazier than looking for 
bigfoot.

394
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:51,970
One of the craziest parts about that 
trip was being in that real rain forest.

395
00:18:51,971 --> 00:18:56,690
The real thing was fucking bananas.
It's thick like La,

396
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,490
like you can't see anything like every 
two feet.

397
00:19:00,491 --> 00:19:03,460
There's another tree.
I mean it's just thick with trees.

398
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,990
Which reminds me of my what my favorite 
thing.

399
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,500
Basically mystery ever db cooper,
because that's where he jumped out of 

400
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:17,181
that plane at really was in the hort 
most horrible place you can imagine.

401
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:20,340
Did he do that in Pacific northwest?
Oh yeah.

402
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:25,370
Super.
They flew out to Seattle head and back 

403
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,410
down again and he just hit that button 
on the rear.

404
00:19:26,411 --> 00:19:29,340
That's crazy.
They felt the plane shake and then boof,

405
00:19:29,341 --> 00:19:34,341
he's gone.
He's going to land in the trees for 

406
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:34,341
sure.
And it seems like that.

407
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,510
But his parachute,
none of his stuff ever recovered.

408
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:40,050
And then they combed that thing.
They did find like a stack of money,

409
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:44,010
I think like 10 or 20,000
of the bills sort of buried it.

410
00:19:44,011 --> 00:19:49,011
A beach next to a creek,
but for the most part it's one of my 

411
00:19:49,011 --> 00:19:53,960
favorite fucking little.
I mean the fact that that guy may be 

412
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,960
made off with,
I think it was only,

413
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:58,620
it was something low like 150 or 
$200,000.

414
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,730
Yeah.
200,000

415
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:04,731
dollars.
But back then because this is in what 

416
00:20:04,731 --> 00:20:04,731
year?
A 71.

417
00:20:04,731 --> 00:20:05,990
Seventy one.
Wow.

418
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,570
And he didn't just hijack the plane.
He made the plane land,

419
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,050
get rid of the passengers,
bring them parachutes,

420
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:15,810
bring the money and have it take off 
again.

421
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,840
Like this is way back before p,
you know,

422
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:23,990
he just,
he was a true hijack and they land at 

423
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:23,990
the airport.
They're like,

424
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,390
I'm going to save all the passengers 
lives,

425
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,000
but here's the catch.
I need $200,000,

426
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:32,400
a few parachutes and something else.
Like something weird.

427
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:34,410
Right.
Wow.

428
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,380
And they never found him.
They never found the body.

429
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:41,040
They never found his suit.
They found this clip on tie somehow that

430
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:47,300
was found somewhere.
But it makes it even crazier when you 

431
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,811
factor in that they found the clip on 
tie and not the parachute and not the 

432
00:20:50,811 --> 00:20:50,811
suit and not,
you know what I mean?

433
00:20:50,811 --> 00:20:55,000
Because then it's almost like he's just 
got his 200,000

434
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:00,040
is just walking off.
I think they said that the money was 

435
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,720
never spent though.
Is that true?

436
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,840
I'm looking up a and August of last year
they found a 18 inch nylon strap,

437
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:10,540
which they think might have been a piece
of his parachute.

438
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,280
Um,
I don't know how they would know that 

439
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,941
right away,
but some looking up some other 

440
00:21:17,941 --> 00:21:17,941
information

441
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,320
might've been some shit campers left 
behind too.

442
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:25,240
Yeah.
And I was just in a,

443
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:28,010
in Australia and I visited the grave of 
uh,

444
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:33,670
the uh,
tie him should shimmered should the,

445
00:21:33,921 --> 00:21:36,380
another crazy mystery one.
You ever hear that one?

446
00:21:36,381 --> 00:21:39,950
The guy that was found at the beach in 
Adelaide,

447
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,430
I actually went to the cemetery and 
visited his grave during the day.

448
00:21:43,431 --> 00:21:48,431
One of the days I had off.
They're out when I was doing shows in 

449
00:21:48,431 --> 00:21:49,880
Adelaide and this guy was founded a 
beach.

450
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:54,990
This is one and another one of the great
mysteries ever found it a beach wearing 

451
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:55,560
a suit.
A,

452
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,380
he had a half lit a cigarette that was 
out in his collar.

453
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,210
They found him.
He'd been dead.

454
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,480
They don't know the guy.
There's no id on him,

455
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:08,600
no nothing.
So they keep them around for a few weeks

456
00:22:08,601 --> 00:22:13,601
in the morgue,
waiting for some type of information on 

457
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:13,601
the guy.

458
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:18,220
They just don't want to bury him.
And eventually they cut through is 

459
00:22:19,251 --> 00:22:23,720
closed and they find that there is a 
little pocket with a piece of paper,

460
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,000
like on the inseam of his pants or 
shirt,

461
00:22:26,001 --> 00:22:28,280
I can't remember.
They trace that.

462
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:33,340
They can tell that it's cut out of a 
book called the tie am should or 

463
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:37,241
something like that.
I'm not saying it right because it's 

464
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:39,041
some old Latin word or something and.
But there's a code on it and a phone 

465
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,670
number or some or no,
there's a code on it,

466
00:22:40,671 --> 00:22:43,190
but they know that no,
there's not a code on it.

467
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,060
It's just a piece of paper from a book 
and they have the page and everything.

468
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:48,620
So they go to the newspaper,
they're like,

469
00:22:48,621 --> 00:22:51,680
hey,
does anybody know have this copy of this

470
00:22:51,681 --> 00:22:53,480
book so that we can find out who this 
guy is on,

471
00:22:53,481 --> 00:22:54,560
why this is so dead on them.

472
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:59,950
They don't get anything.
So they go nationwide do Australia and 

473
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:00,110
try to figure out what this piece of 
papers from.

474
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,410
They find the book in another part of 
Australia with the missing part.

475
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,720
And in that book is a phone number and a
code that every codebreaker ever is 

476
00:23:08,841 --> 00:23:10,760
tried to figure out and they just don't 
know.

477
00:23:10,761 --> 00:23:13,610
So it's the tomb of the unknown man.
Whoa.

478
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,580
Yeah.
And it goes like deep.

479
00:23:16,581 --> 00:23:21,020
There's so many theories about what 
happened to this guy.

480
00:23:21,021 --> 00:23:23,920
And it could have been the CIA,
he could have been an American spy,

481
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,660
could have been a Russian spy,
could have been an Australian spy,

482
00:23:26,661 --> 00:23:29,360
like nobody knows anything about this 
guy.

483
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,080
And they followed up and there's some,
there's a guy that like,

484
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,960
has some crazy theory,
but I don't know.

485
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,600
There's a guy that has a crazy theory.
I mean,

486
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:40,760
there's a ton of freedom in the world.
You know,

487
00:23:40,761 --> 00:23:43,040
there's people that think that the Elon 
musk thing was fake.

488
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,750
It was a hoax.
Oh my God.

489
00:23:44,751 --> 00:23:46,310
I someone yesterday

490
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:51,310
with that malarkey tie to mystery death 
in Australia to Thomas Jefferson.

491
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:59,540
Winds that from this is that guy 
identified man found dead Australian 

492
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:03,760
beach baffled investigators for decades 
and new DNA analysis links somerton man 

493
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,900
to Thomas Jefferson and native 
Americans.

494
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,260
So he was an ancestor of Thomas 
Jefferson and native Americans.

495
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,660
That's interesting.
I've never read that.

496
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:16,680
Yeah.
So they essentially just did a DNA test 

497
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,151
on,
they call them the somerton man because 

498
00:24:19,151 --> 00:24:19,151
that's the beach that,
uh,

499
00:24:19,151 --> 00:24:19,820
he was found out.
You guys,

500
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,550
you know about this Elizabeth Warren 
stuff.

501
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:28,030
Do you know who that woman is?
She's a politician and she apparently at

502
00:24:28,881 --> 00:24:33,881
one point in her life claim to be part 
native American and now just like won't 

503
00:24:35,571 --> 00:24:38,090
talk about it,
won't do a DNA test,

504
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,760
won't.
She's like,

505
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,410
they were like,
do you have any pictures?

506
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:42,920
She's like,
yes,

507
00:24:42,921 --> 00:24:44,510
I have many pictures and they're not for
you.

508
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:48,020
This is what she said to investigators,
man.

509
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,530
And then you got trump.
Just Hollander Polka Pocahontas.

510
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:56,531
It's so brutal.
She hits back at trump's use of 

511
00:24:56,531 --> 00:24:57,530
pocahontas vows to highlight native 
American issues.

512
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,840
You know,
I wish I wasn't skeptical.

513
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,160
I wish.
I thought she was.

514
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,740
She was awesome.
And this isn't real.

515
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:09,430
But what's weird is that I think it,
it gave you some sort of an advantage 

516
00:25:10,161 --> 00:25:15,161
for her to be native American in terms 
of like getting into certain schools or 

517
00:25:15,161 --> 00:25:19,301
what have you.
I don't know if that's true and she 

518
00:25:19,301 --> 00:25:20,840
might be part native American.
She might be like,

519
00:25:20,841 --> 00:25:22,040
fuck you.
I don't have to tell you.

520
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,010
That's possible too.
I don't think that's the best move,

521
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,350
but maybe she doesn't know.
Maybe she like,

522
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:32,380
there's always something that's.
That is a thing with families like your 

523
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:32,380
family telling you,
yeah,

524
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,581
you're uh,
your grandmother was 23 percent Navajo 

525
00:25:36,581 --> 00:25:36,581
and you're like,
wow,

526
00:25:36,581 --> 00:25:36,581
I'm fucking cool.

527
00:25:36,581 --> 00:25:39,290
It gives you an extra little bit of a 
bad ass.

528
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:44,350
This is why Jane Goodall was willing to 
accept the two native Americans told me,

529
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:50,170
well,
you could have talked to two other ones 

530
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:50,170
who would have said,
what the fuck out of here with that?

531
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,650
I mean people are people,
man.

532
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,680
It doesn't matter if you're a white 
person or a native American person or 

533
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,690
whatever your ethnicity is.
There's gonna be a spectrum of people in

534
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:02,870
that group and some of them are going to
be big foot believers.

535
00:26:02,871 --> 00:26:07,871
Man,
it doesn't matter if they're native 

536
00:26:07,871 --> 00:26:07,871
American.
It doesn't mean there's.

537
00:26:07,871 --> 00:26:10,560
Sometimes people are bored and they want
to believe in bigfoot.

538
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:15,610
So they start thinking.
They hear things that they don't really 

539
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:15,610
here,
they start thinking they're camping out.

540
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:16,700
This one guy thought they were camping 
out outside his window,

541
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:22,060
that they lived in the forest,
like right outside his backdoor that 

542
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,600
they come near where he is season.
They read your mind.

543
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,750
They they can sense when cameras are 
around.

544
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,440
They won't show themselves.
Oh,

545
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:32,150
that's pretty smart.
What a great evolved habit that is,

546
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,750
but then like we were saying earlier,
some of them truly believe that big foot

547
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:40,751
is like some interstellar traveler that 
may be from another dimension is a 

548
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,230
creature from another dimension.
Yeah,

549
00:26:43,231 --> 00:26:44,040
because creatures

550
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:49,040
from other dimensions are super hairy to
and look just like that and that makes 

551
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,170
sense.

552
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,230
Real,
but you can only see them when you're on

553
00:26:51,231 --> 00:26:53,900
mushrooms.
Do you imagine that?

554
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:59,050
That sort of makes sense.
Imagine if you did like there was a 

555
00:26:59,050 --> 00:26:59,050
perfect dose.
We.

556
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:04,001
You could see him,
he'd get into his world and you see 

557
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:06,451
them.
It looks like bigfoot buddies all in 

558
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:06,451
like a rainbow.

559
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:11,730
I mean I've been on mushrooms and seeing
the same thing that wasn't there is 

560
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,180
somebody next to me.
I thought it was a Ufo,

561
00:27:13,181 --> 00:27:15,730
but somebody,
one of the guys told me that it was a,

562
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:20,790
it was a,
like someone playing with like a laser 

563
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:20,790
light thing,
like out in the distance.

564
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,950
Oh,
but I don't know.

565
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,100
It could have been if you're on 
mushrooms,

566
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:28,490
it could be if you saw laser,
laser pointers are so weird,

567
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,760
like assholes point at planes.
Like that's how ridiculous those things 

568
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:33,760
are.

569
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:38,200
It's um,
it's Kinda weird.

570
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,920
It's very weird.
When I was a kid that was like,

571
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:48,210
the funniest thing you could do was just
have a laser pointer and have a red dot 

572
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:52,710
appear on the wall.
Like during class teacher has no first.

573
00:27:53,531 --> 00:27:54,690
They didn't know about it.
Remember?

574
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,590
Yeah.
Teachers who didn't know about it.

575
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,270
Yeah,
it was red dots are showing up.

576
00:27:58,271 --> 00:28:00,520
They didn't know what.
It was very rebellious.

577
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,820
Cats love those things.
So that's always fun.

578
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,800
That became like a thing in a movie.
Man.

579
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:10,830
Dude's got his hands up.
Red Dots moving all over his body means 

580
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,440
they had the gun on him.
Right.

581
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:13,780
That was the exciting part of a movie.
Like,

582
00:28:13,781 --> 00:28:14,750
oh my God,
look,

583
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:15,230
they got them.

584
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,070
Yeah.
It happened to me and my buddies once we

585
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,570
were speeding away,
we were under age.

586
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:22,220
A highschool drinking party.
Yeah,

587
00:28:22,221 --> 00:28:24,310
I.
It was nasty in the party.

588
00:28:24,311 --> 00:28:29,311
Got Busted by the cops.
Everybody ran out the back door like 70 

589
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:29,380
kids at once.
Me,

590
00:28:29,381 --> 00:28:34,381
my four buddies got slammed into my one 
pals car and we're driving down the 

591
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:36,060
street and you just hear,
stop.

592
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:39,470
Stopped off fucking car.
And I looked to my right.

593
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,270
My buddy in the middle of the backseat 
has the red dot right on.

594
00:28:43,271 --> 00:28:45,250
I'm up and down from his head to his 
neck.

595
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,790
He was crazy.
Christ.

596
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,480
Yeah.
We all got in trouble cause you never 

597
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:55,480
know.
They never know.

598
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,000
Could it be young Tony Hinchcliffe and 
is ms dot [inaudible] friend or could it

599
00:28:59,001 --> 00:29:03,020
be murderer bank robber trying to flee?
Yeah.

600
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,650
This cop,
that cop in particular was a real,

601
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,390
real bad person.
Like,

602
00:29:08,391 --> 00:29:13,391
I mean,
he knew that they just busted up a kids 

603
00:29:13,391 --> 00:29:16,600
drinking party and that all the kids 
were scattering at once and he decided 

604
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,900
to stand in the middle of the street and
he said that like,

605
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,330
you know,
first of all,

606
00:29:20,331 --> 00:29:24,080
he could have easily have shot us 
because you're standing in the middle of

607
00:29:24,081 --> 00:29:26,840
the street instead of having common 
sense,

608
00:29:26,841 --> 00:29:29,570
like there's so many other things 
happening,

609
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,920
but he,
you know,

610
00:29:30,921 --> 00:29:35,921
he could say that that's assault with a 
deadly weapon if you're driving towards 

611
00:29:35,921 --> 00:29:36,070
somebody.
So he runs out in the street,

612
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:38,060
pulls out his gun,
almost can't wait.

613
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,500
It seemed from my buddy to not stop.
I mean

614
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:43,870
it's just,
it was one of those,

615
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,420
one of those shady cops.
In fact,

616
00:29:46,421 --> 00:29:50,470
I'm pretty sure that's the same cop from
where I'm from that saw a Ufo and it was

617
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,480
on a kid.
There was a big thing in liberty 

618
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,490
township just outside of youngstown 
where this one cop saw a Ufo.

619
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,390
Nobody could take them seriously.

620
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,440
Oh my God.
That is hilarious.

621
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,290
But here's the thing,
by me saying all this,

622
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:11,980
I'm not saying that people haven't seen 
Ufos because I don't know what they've 

623
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:16,241
seen.
It's totally possible that something 

624
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:17,300
that's capable of coming here from 
another dimension,

625
00:30:17,301 --> 00:30:20,610
especially before recently,
right,

626
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:25,990
would be able to figure out how to avoid
detection somehow or another.

627
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,060
They're probably pretty close to 
figuring out how to do that now.

628
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,360
I mean,
they have the stealth bomber which 

629
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,000
avoids radar detection and they.
I know they have those cloaks.

630
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,800
You've seen those jackets of people 
where,

631
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:41,060
where it literally shows a video of 
what's behind you,

632
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,240
Huh?
Yeah.

633
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:47,430
It's like this new technology that 
they're trying to develop where 

634
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:50,750
literally you,
your clothes would show exactly what's 

635
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,820
behind you.
So you've got a camera,

636
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:57,850
some sort of camera system mounted 
somewhere on you and it's taking a 

637
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,030
picture of what's behind you.
It's streaming what's behind you.

638
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,640
And so then that appears on your 
clothes.

639
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:06,730
So as you move,
you literally are everything that's 

640
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,611
behind you.
There's this weird like Predator effect 

641
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:10,430
from the movie.
It's very crude right now,

642
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:13,760
but you look at it and you go,
oh,

643
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,490
this is the future.
They're just going to become,

644
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,450
everything's going to be.

645
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,230
It's the future.
Scary.

646
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,240
You watched veneer?
Yes.

647
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,880
Oh my God.
They make it look like everything in the

648
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,570
future's going to make us crazy.
So,

649
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,540
so good,
man.

650
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,800
Wow.
So good.

651
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:33,120
Yeah.
In terms of like a show that makes you 

652
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,120
just like after the show's over,
you just go,

653
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,901
what the fuck?
That crocodile expert episode rather 

654
00:31:37,901 --> 00:31:42,470
crocodile.
I had like 15 friends text me after that

655
00:31:42,471 --> 00:31:45,200
going,
what in the fuck was that?

656
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:50,620
What the fuck?
It's so crazy and it's so good and you 

657
00:31:51,051 --> 00:31:52,640
can see it happening.
You're like,

658
00:31:52,641 --> 00:31:54,020
no,
no fucking way.

659
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:57,230
No fucking way.
Oh my God.

660
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:01,460
I don't remember a show ever.
Does that powerful?

661
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,440
Like when it comes to science fiction 
type show?

662
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,670
Yeah.
I don't remember.

663
00:32:04,671 --> 00:32:07,010
I mean there were some amazing shows on 
before,

664
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:09,800
but they're all really fiction shows,
right?

665
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:14,390
Like this is fiction with like a dash of
futuristic possibility,

666
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:19,570
like dystopian future.
That fucking dog one with the robot dog.

667
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:23,090
Oh Jesus Christ.
What was that called?

668
00:32:23,091 --> 00:32:24,080
Metal head.
Is that what it was?

669
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:27,030
Fucking a man.
Oh,

670
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,900
I could see this.
This could be real,

671
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,150
like what?
What are we doing?

672
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:36,110
The future seems scary.
You see that robot open up the door,

673
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,120
open up the door and hold it for his now
dude.

674
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,320
Robot opened up a door.
Click open the latch.

675
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:47,110
Well,
yeah,

676
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,510
that guy.
Dude,

677
00:32:48,511 --> 00:32:50,780
look at this thing.
Watch this shit.

678
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:54,110
Let's just first of all,
look at it and just imagine it with guns

679
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:56,480
everywhere.
Of course you could imagine that,

680
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:00,530
right?
Laser pointers and guns everywhere.

681
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,850
So this thing walks up,

682
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:06,100
grabs the fucking handle,
turns the door,

683
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,500
check this out,
puts its leg there to stop the door,

684
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,420
walks the door back so it has some kind 
of intelligence in less.

685
00:33:16,421 --> 00:33:21,421
That's a programmed move in.
Has there ever been anything that 

686
00:33:21,421 --> 00:33:23,380
doesn't get it like a virus or things go
wrong at some point?

687
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:26,440
Of course this is all gonna happen.
Go wrong,

688
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:31,560
it's going to go wrong,
but I wonder if that's a program to 

689
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,311
move.
Like it told them the exact steps to 

690
00:33:35,311 --> 00:33:37,951
take and it measured out all the inches 
and then knew the exact movements to 

691
00:33:37,951 --> 00:33:42,271
make or if it can accurately,
accurately calculate distance.

692
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:46,900
So they've given it in a sense,
some sort of electronic eyes,

693
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,180
right?
If it can walk up to a door,

694
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,610
grab the handle,
turn it and pull it,

695
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,270
and then hold the door open.
When it's leg lead,

696
00:33:55,271 --> 00:33:58,750
it's friends go by like what is that?
We're fucked.

697
00:33:58,751 --> 00:33:59,950
That's.
But that's.

698
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:05,280
That kind of articulation is very crazy 
to think that you could teach something 

699
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:05,680
to do that.

700
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:09,940
So if you only teach and to do doors or 
can I do that with everything?

701
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,630
That's when it gets weird when it gets 
weird is if,

702
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,910
if it can create.
If you could figure out,

703
00:34:15,911 --> 00:34:18,880
well if it works on this,
what kind of door do we have here?

704
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,490
Oh I see.
This thing is just a slide.

705
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,080
Is it going to be able to figure that 
out?

706
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,670
That's,
that's kind of,

707
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,450
it's.
It seems.

708
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,380
It seems like it would be able to figure
it out pretty easily.

709
00:34:29,381 --> 00:34:34,381
Especially when you factor in that 
everything in the future is going to be 

710
00:34:34,381 --> 00:34:37,081
more like technological anyway.
Like the doors even turning a knob or 

711
00:34:37,271 --> 00:34:41,920
sliding a door is going to be ridiculous
because people are just going to be like

712
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,330
jet eyes or whatever.
You know?

713
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:48,360
A lot of people have fingerprint things 
now for stuff like fingerprint things 

714
00:34:48,671 --> 00:34:52,990
for like opening doors,
seeing fingerprint things for a locks at

715
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:54,910
the gym.
Just a fingerprint thing now.

716
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,720
That's like a new thing.

717
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:57,800
Yeah.

718
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,440
That's why you wouldn't want to cut off 
your thumb out of,

719
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,410
out of all the fingers.
Cut Off.

720
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,010
Well,
it's just,

721
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:08,490
it's,
it's just really interesting to me how 

722
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:10,750
quick all this technology's moving and 
how that doesn't.

723
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:13,690
It doesn't seem like there's any end in 
sight and most of us,

724
00:35:13,691 --> 00:35:18,691
like you and I,
like normal people are sitting back 

725
00:35:18,691 --> 00:35:19,630
watching this on internet videos going,
whew.

726
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,400
Um,
what do we,

727
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,070
what do we do?
Like when,

728
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:29,220
when do we stop?
Why don't we stop making robots that 

729
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:32,941
could kill us.
Like before they're smart or after 

730
00:35:32,941 --> 00:35:33,010
they're smart,
they're smart,

731
00:35:33,011 --> 00:35:34,180
they're going to just stay alive

732
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:38,070
and obviously as soon as we can latch 
guns onto them

733
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,810
going in.

734
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,290
Yeah.
That's what a drone is.

735
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:47,650
Yeah.
Think about one of the drone where the 

736
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:49,271
drone is.
What a drone is it someone is piloting 

737
00:35:49,271 --> 00:35:49,271
something.
Just because it's flying around,

738
00:35:49,271 --> 00:35:50,060
it doesn't mean it's not a robot.
All right.

739
00:35:50,061 --> 00:35:55,061
That's a fucking robot.
It's a robot airship and they're flying 

740
00:35:55,061 --> 00:35:58,671
it around and they're getting these kids
that are wizards and video games I'll 

741
00:35:58,671 --> 00:36:02,700
give you want to have some fucking 
impossible to beat armies.

742
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:08,330
You.
You Hook them up with some of those I 

743
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,241
robot things from that will smith movie.
You make them all bulletproof and you 

744
00:36:10,241 --> 00:36:13,670
have a bunch of kids that just play 
wicked video games all day.

745
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:17,240
Know how to fuck people up with madden 
and that UFC game.

746
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:22,820
You fucking send those kids,
piloting these things in real time.

747
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:26,690
You send them to parts of the world and 
why that would be.

748
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:32,320
First of all,
it'd be 10 times more terrifying than 

749
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:32,320
drones.
Right?

750
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,050
Some things were running through your 
street.

751
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:35,760
I just thought of something.
I was going to say.

752
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,820
The problem I've always had with this 
idea is like our battery life that we 

753
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,160
use on stuff is terrible.
Yeah,

754
00:36:41,161 --> 00:36:46,161
it's going to eat people,
but what batteries are they using in 

755
00:36:46,161 --> 00:36:49,001
those drones that are flying up above 
now that are over overseas doing damage 

756
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:51,180
on and whatnot?
Are those like special batteries that we

757
00:36:51,181 --> 00:36:55,950
don't have access to that maybe in five 
years we will ask this question won't be

758
00:36:55,951 --> 00:36:56,790
so weird to us

759
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:01,820
is are you sure that that's the way 
those things fly was almost just going 

760
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:01,820
to ask that.
I don't know how they fly.

761
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,970
I don't think they're gas powered 
though,

762
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:03,690
but.
Well,

763
00:37:03,691 --> 00:37:05,610
let's find out.
That'd be a good thing to know.

764
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:08,130
Might not be able to find that out.
I don't think they won't.

765
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,200
Department of Defense stuff.
You're scared to Google it.

766
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:18,300
That you want to be good.
You do not want to google.

767
00:37:20,191 --> 00:37:24,270
How far?
How far can you fly a drone and wonder?

768
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:27,930
I'd rather run on gasoline while it's 
carrying two missiles.

769
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:28,800
Just wondering.

770
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,220
That sounds like the most American thing
ever.

771
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:35,600
The drones filled with gas and oil.
Just wondering with missiles.

772
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,610
That's what's happening.
Drones.

773
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:47,110
Well,
we have to worry about people more than 

774
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:47,570
we even have to worry about drones.
Right.

775
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,380
This new shooting in Florida freaked me 
the fuck out again.

776
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,910
Yeah,
it's happening all the time now.

777
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,940
It's horrific.
And the crazy thing is like kids used to

778
00:37:58,941 --> 00:38:01,280
joke around about this guy doing that 
someday.

779
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,010
That was something they joked around 
about.

780
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,210
I think that,
uh,

781
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:12,770
I think that the way that the news 
reports it and the way that it's such 

782
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:16,371
big news isn't helping at all because 
one thing that I've noticed is the whole

783
00:38:16,531 --> 00:38:19,500
car ramming thing,
like that's a new thing,

784
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:24,590
car ramming where the,
a lot of the things that are happening 

785
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:27,600
or people just getting in a truck or a 
car and just running people down.

786
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,570
It's a fairly new thing that started 
with like,

787
00:38:30,571 --> 00:38:35,571
I don't know,
maybe that French one or something like 

788
00:38:35,571 --> 00:38:35,571
that.
I can't remember the first one,

789
00:38:35,571 --> 00:38:35,960
but since then because report,
you know,

790
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,980
they're just,
they report it and they blow these 

791
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:40,980
things up and then bing bang,
boom.

792
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:45,391
Like I feel like going off of the car 
ramming situation and the growth in car 

793
00:38:45,401 --> 00:38:50,401
rammings alone that we could sort of see
how overly reporting these.

794
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:56,550
I mean,
I don't know if that's even a thing or 

795
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:56,550
if I'm.
What I'm saying is making sense at all,

796
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:56,550
but

797
00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:00,670
I know what you're trying to say,
but the counter to that I would be 

798
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,510
someone had.
What was the,

799
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,550
the.
Someone made a really good analogy.

800
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:12,190
The point being what this is,
is only happening here.

801
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,620
We have to figure out why it's happening
here.

802
00:39:15,621 --> 00:39:18,230
So often it rarely happens anywhere 
else,

803
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,320
but here it happens pretty often.
So what is that?

804
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,400
Is it access to guns?
Is it mental health?

805
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,370
Is it both of those things?
Is it,

806
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:35,300
it's just far too easy to get guns.
Is it that you're not being monitored in

807
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:40,410
the sense of being talked about and 
people don't want to anybody infringing 

808
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:41,370
upon their rights?
Right.

809
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:46,790
But if we just sat down and had a 
rational conversation with someone to 

810
00:39:49,501 --> 00:39:51,120
renew a gun license,
you know,

811
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:55,560
rational conversation with someone who 
doesn't work for a gun group or anything

812
00:39:55,561 --> 00:40:00,561
to someone who could just give you a 
reasonable reason why you should be 

813
00:40:02,221 --> 00:40:07,221
suspicious about this person having a 
firearm or you really don't want to do 

814
00:40:07,221 --> 00:40:07,221
that either though,
because you can't trust people.

815
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:11,010
It's like you're putting people in a 
position of power to decide who gets the

816
00:40:11,011 --> 00:40:13,590
guns and who doesn't get the guns.
It's all very,

817
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,740
very fucking terrifying and confusing.

818
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:21,760
That seems like the Ar 15 is the one 
that they need to keep an eye on because

819
00:40:21,761 --> 00:40:26,761
all the biggest ones are that.
And it seems to be able to mount our 

820
00:40:26,761 --> 00:40:26,761
mode down a lot of people at once.

821
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:31,830
Yeah.
Semiautomatic rifles are more effective 

822
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,010
in those type of mass shooting 
situations.

823
00:40:33,011 --> 00:40:35,060
That's why those guys use them.
That's why they use them.

824
00:40:35,061 --> 00:40:38,500
And you know,
all sorts of horrific ways.

825
00:40:38,501 --> 00:40:40,000
All we're all around the world,
right?

826
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:42,010
That's what they're good at.
That.

827
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:45,450
So then the question is,
are they to lethal for a regular person?

828
00:40:45,451 --> 00:40:50,451
Just be carrying around where you'd want
to know why a regular person wants to 

829
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:53,500
carry him around and then you would 
realize,

830
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:58,950
is that really my right?
Even ask a regular person why they need 

831
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:58,950
it.

832
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:03,920
I mean if most of these people are law 
abiding gun owners,

833
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:09,850
when we freak out that one person who 
legally bought a gun in this case is a 

834
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,250
kid who legally bought it,
does it,

835
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,280
does this horrific thing.
It's a very good question and it's a 

836
00:41:18,381 --> 00:41:23,381
question we often ask ourselves like how
many times does this happen before 

837
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:26,300
something happens and is the.
Is the answer arming the schools.

838
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:30,830
That's a fucking terrifying answer.
The putting armed guards at schools,

839
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:34,940
I saw a story where had held up to 
signs,

840
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:39,340
which it was like a instagram thing and 
so it was.

841
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:44,420
The two signs were which one of these 
signs would make you feel good if you 

842
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:48,290
were like a killer and it shows no 
weapons,

843
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:53,470
no weapons sign,
and then it also shows a sign with an 

844
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:58,181
armed guard saying that the staff is 
armed and trained and you know,

845
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:01,820
you're looking at the two of those.
You're like,

846
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:04,760
God damn it.
I don't want either one of these fucking

847
00:42:04,761 --> 00:42:09,761
things.
I definitely don't want weapons in the 

848
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:12,240
schools,
but I don't want them to need weapons in

849
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:13,980
schools.
That's why I don't want it there.

850
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:16,800
Yeah,
but when they.

851
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:20,220
When scenes like this happen,
you have to go,

852
00:42:20,221 --> 00:42:21,960
well,
how is there a way?

853
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:27,110
I don't know.
I don't know what the way is other than 

854
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,360
even if you take people's guns away,
God damn you're.

855
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,850
You're not going to get all of them.
There's too many of them.

856
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:35,760
The number of guns that people have 
today,

857
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,680
I,
I think it outnumbers humans.

858
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:46,250
I think the number of guns like total in
this country outnumber humans insanity.

859
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:53,360
Even if you are for guns,
when the number of things that can kill 

860
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:58,971
us outnumber us.
Are we overreacting?

861
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:04,850
Are we crazy?
Are we stockpiling for some fucking 

862
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,090
terrible collapsed that we're all afraid
of?

863
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,050
Is that just our thing?
Because we're like,

864
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:14,250
uh,
we were like the last country or 

865
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:14,450
whatever you think.
Is it like defensive question?

866
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:17,960
Difficult question,
like crazy,

867
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,370
scared country.

868
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:20,210
Well,
there's,

869
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:25,240
you know,
there's different uses for firearms and 

870
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,170
who are you to say that like 
recreational shooters who are 

871
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:33,520
respectable law abiding people and 
there's a lot of them out there that are

872
00:43:33,621 --> 00:43:38,621
very good people.
They just love to shoot pistols at 

873
00:43:38,621 --> 00:43:39,980
targets.
They do competitions,

874
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:45,190
they enjoy it.
They like being proficient with a 

875
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,310
firearm for their own personal safety 
and there have been cases,

876
00:43:46,311 --> 00:43:51,311
I think there was a case in shit,
I want to say it was in Ohio where some 

877
00:43:51,311 --> 00:43:56,141
guy was stabbing somebody at a mall and 
some dude who was a trained shooter at 

878
00:43:57,521 --> 00:44:02,521
one of those shooting competition things
shot the guy and killed him when he was 

879
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:07,750
running around stabbing people at the 
mall and it was one of those things 

880
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:11,651
where no one wanted to play that up in 
the media because they thought it was 

881
00:44:11,651 --> 00:44:16,271
like irresponsible.
It's irresponsible to play up the idea 

882
00:44:16,271 --> 00:44:17,590
of the rogue vigilante with the pistol.
Yeah,

883
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:20,690
but,
but that was a real guy,

884
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,180
like the guys actually like kind of a 
hero.

885
00:44:23,181 --> 00:44:26,690
Like if he was in a Bruce Willis movie,
he'd be fucking pumped.

886
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:29,910
Like that guy's kind of a hero.
Like he,

887
00:44:29,911 --> 00:44:34,911
he was a normal citizen that happened to
have a concealed carry permit.

888
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:35,460
Right.

889
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:41,140
Found another similar story,
I guess from what you're describing in 

890
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:41,300
Minnesota was an off duty cop that 
stopped somebody that was established.

891
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:42,810
Cool.
Yeah.

892
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:45,230
It was an off duty cop.
That was the stab ones.

893
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,270
So I got that wrong.
It was he who was the firearm instructor

894
00:44:48,271 --> 00:44:50,280
one.
I don't know.

895
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:55,260
This might have been another similar 
story to it might have been,

896
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,320
but there was definitely one.
I'm sorry if I fucked that up.

897
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:03,420
Um,
there was definitely one where the guy 

898
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:03,420
was a,
a,

899
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,760
one of those big NRA shooting 
competition type characters.

900
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,540
This is a terrible,
terrible tragedy.

901
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:14,750
Tragedy.
And these terrible tragedies seemed to 

902
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:15,710
keep happening and we don't do anything 
to change.

903
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,600
Everybody's worried about,
you know,

904
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:21,540
their second amendment rights being 
taken away.

905
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:26,660
You know,
people are worried about law abiding 

906
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:26,660
people who would never do anything like 
this.

907
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:26,880
Worried about their guns getting taken 
away.

908
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:29,100
But they,
in all,

909
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:31,230
all of us we have,
we have to figure this out.

910
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:36,320
This,
this can't just keep going on this way 

911
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:36,320
and whatever it is,
whatever's causing it,

912
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,190
whether it's the way people are raising 
people,

913
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:41,370
the way people are treating people,
whatever.

914
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,690
Fucking crazy mental imbalances that 
were not treating in each other,

915
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,880
whatever the fuck it is,
whether it's biological,

916
00:45:47,881 --> 00:45:52,040
whatever the fuck it is,
fact that we just can't keep as a,

917
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,020
as a civilization,
as a,

918
00:45:54,021 --> 00:45:58,120
as a,
a thing that should in its best times to

919
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,550
be able to get along great with each 
other.

920
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,730
These little aberrations,
they're horrific aberrations,

921
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:07,440
but they exist frequently.
There's so many of us.

922
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:11,400
Yeah,
320 something million people.

923
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:14,790
This was from 2015 more guns and people.
Yeah.

924
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,140
Well,
okay.

925
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,750
Oh boy.
Wow.

926
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:23,780
So the,
there's 317 million people in 2013 and 

927
00:46:24,721 --> 00:46:29,130
$357 million guns.
That's crazy.

928
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:31,170
But then the people who are gun nuts and
be like,

929
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,000
what are you fucking cure?
How many guns?

930
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:35,510
I have been home a button soon,
soon.

931
00:46:35,511 --> 00:46:37,620
I would never do anything like that.
That guy,

932
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,200
dude,
that guy's a piece of shit folk.

933
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:43,770
Him and their right to their right to if
you're,

934
00:46:43,771 --> 00:46:46,770
if you haven't done anything and you 
would never do anything,

935
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:49,560
why would you get lumped in with someone
who has.

936
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:54,590
If you have a truck and you would never 
dream into plowing into a mall full of 

937
00:46:56,131 --> 00:46:58,980
people,
why would you get lumped lumped into the

938
00:46:58,981 --> 00:47:01,560
same group as a guy who has a truck who 
did do that?

939
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:04,230
Why should you?
It's not fair,

940
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:08,110
but we stuffed to figure this out.
It just,

941
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:10,410
there's something wrong.
There's something wrong with.

942
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,900
Is that many more things that can kill 
us.

943
00:47:12,901 --> 00:47:13,530
Then us.

944
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:16,780
If a guy pointed a gun at you from 
across the room,

945
00:47:16,781 --> 00:47:18,910
do you have something in your head plan 
that you would do?

946
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:24,180
There's nothing you can do.
I would do a bunch of cartwheels and 

947
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,300
somersaults.
That's always been my plan.

948
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:27,160
I feel like if I just do weird 
movements,

949
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:29,980
you could avoid almost nothing you can

950
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,740
do.
You know?

951
00:47:32,741 --> 00:47:37,741
It's too terrifying,
terrifying thing.

952
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:42,370
The ability to just end someone's life 
with a single movement of your hand

953
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,860
and we learned so early on.
I remember duck hunt as a kid.

954
00:47:46,861 --> 00:47:48,120
The nintendo like tick,
tick,

955
00:47:48,121 --> 00:47:48,480
tick,
tick,

956
00:47:48,481 --> 00:47:48,810
tick,
tick,

957
00:47:48,811 --> 00:47:50,070
tick.
Remember that gun,

958
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:53,580
you know,
it's like we learned so early on,

959
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:58,970
well,
it's just that people value people so 

960
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:02,870
poorly that they would do that.
This is where we have to find like the 

961
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:06,450
root of what that is and that sounds.
This sounds very philosophical and hippy

962
00:48:06,451 --> 00:48:08,350
dippy,
but we,

963
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:13,760
we have to examine what could possibly 
be inside someone that would make them 

964
00:48:14,821 --> 00:48:18,060
want to do something like that.
What would that be?

965
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:20,460
I don't mean how the fuck does that 
happen?

966
00:48:20,461 --> 00:48:24,150
How does a,
how were there in the same timeline?

967
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:29,151
We're not talking about like primitive 
Roman days or the vikings or anything 

968
00:48:29,151 --> 00:48:31,980
crazy we're talking about right now.
How in the same timeline does a guy like

969
00:48:31,981 --> 00:48:35,490
you exist alongside someone who could do
that?

970
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,430
There's something wrong.
There's A.

971
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:44,020
I also think that there's something to 
be said about like awareness of 

972
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:47,990
depression and psychological disorders 
for the older generation.

973
00:48:48,121 --> 00:48:52,620
I feel like in the future more people 
are gonna know about it and take it as a

974
00:48:52,621 --> 00:48:54,780
real thing,
but I still think now there's probably.

975
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:59,330
There's definitely a lot of stubborn 
parents out there that ignoring,

976
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:00,750
you're not depressed,
get up,

977
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:05,810
you know,
and all of this because it's definitely 

978
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:07,830
deep rooted,
a lack of structure in their lives,

979
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:13,430
you know,
stuff's gone wrong and they don't have 

980
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:13,430
anybody to talk to her.
Anything,

981
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:15,570
you know,
that's definitely a common thing.

982
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:20,890
One hundred percent.
The dissatisfaction with their current 

983
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:24,421
state in life,
their physical health people have all 

984
00:49:24,421 --> 00:49:26,650
sorts of undiagnosed mental issues and 
maybe they don't have insurance and they

985
00:49:26,651 --> 00:49:31,651
can't afford treatment or maybe they 
just got off of it and they think 

986
00:49:31,651 --> 00:49:33,070
they're fine.
I mean we know guys who did that who got

987
00:49:33,071 --> 00:49:34,930
off of stuff that they weren't supposed 
to get off of.

988
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:39,931
And then they start getting really 
paranoid and crazy and then someone has 

989
00:49:39,931 --> 00:49:39,931
to talk them down.

990
00:49:39,931 --> 00:49:43,200
And one of the things with being 
depressed like that is,

991
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,790
you know,
and like you said,

992
00:49:44,791 --> 00:49:46,980
if they don't have insurance then all of
a sudden they're like,

993
00:49:46,981 --> 00:49:49,500
I don't have insurance.
A little did they know that it's a phone

994
00:49:49,501 --> 00:49:52,020
call away to get like,
you know,

995
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:57,110
free whatever somehow or help somehow.
But also with the depression makes you 

996
00:49:58,651 --> 00:50:00,660
not want to do that.
It makes you,

997
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:04,830
it's part of it is you don't want to 
sort of find help.

998
00:50:04,831 --> 00:50:05,940
It's hard to reach out.

999
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:09,360
Yeah.
You know what I find it's interesting.

1000
00:50:09,361 --> 00:50:14,361
That is a,
I think avoidable and then maybe we 

1001
00:50:14,361 --> 00:50:14,940
should all like think about this a 
little bit.

1002
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:18,630
There's something that happens whenever 
something takes place,

1003
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:24,180
um,
where people like expect a reaction,

1004
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:29,580
they expect a reaction from.
And there's this tendency to get upset 

1005
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,840
at people that are not showing a 
reaction to it.

1006
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:41,500
Like publicly instantaneous.
Like there's a responsibility to show a 

1007
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:45,731
reaction.
And I've been thinking about this and I 

1008
00:50:45,731 --> 00:50:45,731
was like,
is there,

1009
00:50:45,731 --> 00:50:48,700
I don't know because I had put something
up I think on twitter,

1010
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:52,670
instagram and someone about our show in 
Bakersfield tonight.

1011
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:54,200
And someone said,
hey,

1012
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:59,470
maybe not a great time to promote.
There was a school shooting just saying 

1013
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,190
or something like that.
I didn't know about it.

1014
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:04,160
I don't think,
um,

1015
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:08,570
maybe had heard peripherally that 
something happened.

1016
00:51:08,571 --> 00:51:11,540
Like when I was flipping through Google,
but I didn't know the extent of it.

1017
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:13,460
And then I saw it,
I was like,

1018
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,430
oh my God.
Like,

1019
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,030
I mean that is,
um,

1020
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:28,340
it's one of the worst things people can 
do to people to like snuff out young 

1021
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,100
life for no reason.

1022
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:31,870
Yeah,
it's,

1023
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,410
it's,
it's crazy.

1024
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:34,940
It's becoming so common.

1025
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:37,510
It's becoming common.
And um,

1026
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:40,130
it's like there has to be a way to stop 
it.

1027
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,680
It's almost like,
you know,

1028
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:46,710
a way it's,
I feel like people have become so 

1029
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:50,351
desensitized that like,
it's almost like the new super suicide,

1030
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:51,740
you know,

1031
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:58,090
desensitized.
Because if this had happened 20 years 

1032
00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:00,641
ago,
it'd be a gigantic thing that would 

1033
00:52:00,641 --> 00:52:03,011
freak people out for days and days.
And it would be all anybody's talking 

1034
00:52:03,011 --> 00:52:06,431
about.
So in one sense of I did hear about a 

1035
00:52:06,431 --> 00:52:09,521
school,
I think maybe I'd seen something about 

1036
00:52:09,521 --> 00:52:09,830
the school getting shut down or 
something.

1037
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:10,880
So I'm like,
oh fuck,

1038
00:52:10,881 --> 00:52:11,600
something that happened.

1039
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:17,270
And then going into it later,
the more I looked into it,

1040
00:52:17,271 --> 00:52:19,110
the models like,
Oh God,

1041
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:24,800
like this is just the most heartbreaking
news.

1042
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:26,440
You could ever hear it,
right?

1043
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:32,650
Someone decides to go kill kids story.
You're talking about with the Texas man 

1044
00:52:33,501 --> 00:52:36,890
who opened fire in Texas church shooter.
Was Harold is a good Samaritan.

1045
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,970
Oh,
there was that guy.

1046
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:43,150
There was another guy though.
It must have been the undercover cop 

1047
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:43,250
because it was the stabbing story.
I'm on a conflated them.

1048
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,820
I do that on occasion.
Well,

1049
00:52:46,821 --> 00:52:51,821
we gotta get the story into instances.
Someone who wasn't supposed to be there 

1050
00:52:51,821 --> 00:52:52,550
with a gun,
had a gun.

1051
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,400
One of them just have to be an 
undercover cop.

1052
00:52:56,150 --> 00:53:01,150
You don't want people to be vigilantes.
You don't want people to be out there 

1053
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:01,600
fucking Charles Bronson and that.
But

1054
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:08,690
that was performing in a comedy club in 
Dallas a couple of weeks ago and I was 

1055
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:08,690
standing out front near the,
uh,

1056
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:12,820
like the hosts booth for a second and 
they get a phone call and the guy goes,

1057
00:53:12,821 --> 00:53:14,230
you know what sir?
I actually don't know.

1058
00:53:14,231 --> 00:53:15,670
Let me,
let me ask my boss.

1059
00:53:15,671 --> 00:53:20,671
I've never been asked that before.
And he puts the phone on hold and goes 

1060
00:53:20,671 --> 00:53:22,300
to find the owner.
But like before he does,

1061
00:53:22,301 --> 00:53:24,550
I go,
what's that person asking for?

1062
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:25,710
Like,
I was just curious.

1063
00:53:25,711 --> 00:53:25,980
Like,
what?

1064
00:53:25,981 --> 00:53:27,120
He's never been asked.
He goes,

1065
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:29,250
he wants to know if he can bring his 
gun.

1066
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,300
He has a concealed carry license.
I don't know the exact laws here.

1067
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,680
I'm like,
no,

1068
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,920
don't ask the owner.
He's not allowed to bring his gun and 

1069
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:40,020
get back to that phone call.
No,

1070
00:53:40,021 --> 00:53:44,580
not my two shows that night.
Like no concealed carry.

1071
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:51,710
Yeah.
I got a buddy of mine who carries ever 

1072
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:51,710
horror.
Wow.

1073
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:53,400
Every four man.
Yeah.

1074
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,360
Hope I never accidentally make fire 
though.

1075
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,680
It's firearms instructor.
He's.

1076
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:02,220
He carries everywhere.
He lives in Arizona.

1077
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:04,560
You could do whatever the fuck you want.
And Arizona,

1078
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:05,460
Arizona.
Thanks.

1079
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:06,320
This 1800.

1080
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,540
You think if I did my cart somersaults 
thing,

1081
00:54:08,541 --> 00:54:09,830
you'd still be able to get me though.

1082
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,090
Uh,
maybe not.

1083
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,160
Maybe not.
You are a clever fellow.

1084
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:19,310
I always picture that and I don't know 
what else I always picture is in 

1085
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:21,390
elevators.
If the elevator falls and you're in free

1086
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:22,410
fall,
would you jump?

1087
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,130
Would you try to jump at the end to sort
of zone out

1088
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:25,750
works?

1089
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:31,470
Yeah.
Because you're going the speed of the 

1090
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:31,470
elevator anyway.

1091
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:32,310
Get crushed the same exact amount.
You're fucked.

1092
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,780
Darn it.
Yeah,

1093
00:54:33,781 --> 00:54:35,550
it doesn't work.
I was going to try to jump.

1094
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:37,170
There's nothing you could do with that 
one dude.

1095
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,320
That's sad.
Fucked up.

1096
00:54:40,321 --> 00:54:42,270
Way To die.
Elevator accident.

1097
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:47,660
You know,
that's one of the things when you're in 

1098
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,460
a place like Manhattan and you're on the
89th floor of a building and you're 

1099
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:53,400
like,
what is this nonsense?

1100
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,080
What is this nonsense?

1101
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,730
I figured like it's even worse when they
like,

1102
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:03,090
it gets stuck but it's halfway in 
between floors and someone tries to 

1103
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:05,711
climb out and then you've heard of them 
like getting to capitated or whatever 

1104
00:55:05,711 --> 00:55:05,711
and that their heads there

1105
00:55:05,711 --> 00:55:06,120
half.
Yeah.

1106
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,460
To those people up there in that 90th 
floor.

1107
00:55:08,461 --> 00:55:10,110
Those people are just view monkeys.

1108
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:16,390
Yeah.
I want to look over this whole fucking 

1109
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:17,200
city.
Want be on the first floor?

1110
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:19,490
I want to be on the first floor.
Okay,

1111
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,790
so I can just get the fuck out of there.
Get Out of the office,

1112
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:23,070
go home.
Don't.

1113
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:25,420
Why would I want to be on the 100,
four in less?

1114
00:55:25,421 --> 00:55:30,421
I'm just look down below fucker.
I'm up here at the top of the tree 

1115
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:32,920
because I'm done.
Number one champ.

1116
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:38,090
You helicopter on flying right above 
these guys.

1117
00:55:38,091 --> 00:55:41,410
I'm like Dick out the window,
right.

1118
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:46,440
That's the ultimate is to be a doodle.
Lives in the penthouse and gets 

1119
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,590
helicoptered around Manhattan and 
dropped down some fucking dude covered 

1120
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:53,770
in like extinct Fox for you know,
strutting this shit.

1121
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:59,010
That's the ultimate.
To have a penthouse on the top of a 

1122
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:00,610
giant building in New York City and have
a helicopter landing your roof.

1123
00:56:00,611 --> 00:56:02,860
You'd be special agent baller.

1124
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:06,180
I didn't even get in the helicopter.
I would have the helicopter.

1125
00:56:06,181 --> 00:56:11,181
I would attach a rope to the helicopter 
and have the helicopter go and I just 

1126
00:56:11,181 --> 00:56:13,340
fly like that underneath the helicopter 
so that when they slowly land,

1127
00:56:13,341 --> 00:56:15,970
I land the hard guys like that out

1128
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:17,920
there.
This is what you like.

1129
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:23,130
Not obviously not wearing extinct first,
but there's guys that are that that just

1130
00:56:23,621 --> 00:56:24,430
get helicopter

1131
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:29,430
around Manhattan and they go to the 
Hamptons to get helicoptered out to the 

1132
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:30,100
hamptons.
They land in their estate,

1133
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:35,430
they get out their estate.
They have people waiting there and full 

1134
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:38,290
outfit that work for them during some 
colonial time.

1135
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:38,980
I mean,
they're,

1136
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:43,990
they're living in like,
this is a total alternate universe of 

1137
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:45,160
human beings.
Fuck yeah.

1138
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:50,370
Have you seen those crazy hamptons 
houses like way out and what's this?

1139
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:54,250
NBC and pays for Matt Lauer's helicopter
rides to work.

1140
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:55,330
Oh,
there you go.

1141
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:57,130
From the Hamptons.
Bam.

1142
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:01,870
Per his chopper out to the hamptons 
where as a 40 acre horse farm.

1143
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:09,310
So hard ball and so hard.
And Matt Lauer.

1144
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:12,060
Wow.
Oh,

1145
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:15,980
took a helicopter ride to his nice 
office with a button.

1146
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:18,940
That's that thing man.
And it's not just guys like him.

1147
00:57:18,941 --> 00:57:19,570
It's,
you know,

1148
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:24,100
rich a hedge fund guys and Wall Street 
guys.

1149
00:57:24,101 --> 00:57:29,101
I mean there's,
there's people that just have ungodly 

1150
00:57:29,101 --> 00:57:30,370
sums of money.
Like you can't wrap your head around it.

1151
00:57:30,371 --> 00:57:35,371
You Never gonna understand it.
They have hundred million dollar 

1152
00:57:35,371 --> 00:57:36,850
estates,
hundred million.

1153
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:39,220
You're looking at $100,000,000
estate.

1154
00:57:39,221 --> 00:57:39,850
You're like,
what?

1155
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:43,420
What the fuck is this?
That's insane.

1156
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:49,290
Yeah.
That's a weird thing about capitalism 

1157
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:50,020
that someone can get that far out of,
out of whack.

1158
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:53,890
They could ball that heart above all.
Like what?

1159
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,540
What kind of,
what did you do?

1160
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,000
And those are some of my favorite,
uh,

1161
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:02,040
some of my favorite crazy stories is 
like the jinx,

1162
00:58:02,041 --> 00:58:05,590
the Robert Durst one where he came from,
you know,

1163
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:09,690
the family that owns just Manhattan 
skyscrapers and.

1164
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:11,520
Oh,
he's crazy.

1165
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:15,510
The dupont guy with the wrestling team.
Yeah.

1166
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:16,840
That's another wild one.
Yeah.

1167
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,890
That's one of the wildest ones.
Yeah.

1168
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:20,510
Yeah.
That was a terrifying one.

1169
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:23,840
Steve Carell can act as fucking ass off 
Kenny.

1170
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,570
Hell yeah.
Yeah,

1171
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:30,580
he's great.
It's another thing where someone used a 

1172
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:34,271
gun to kill someone that they were 
threatened by and some sort of a 

1173
00:58:34,271 --> 00:58:38,180
masculine way because Dave Schultz was 
like this super bad ass wrestler.

1174
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,030
Yeah.
Just top of him and his brother Mark,

1175
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:45,680
top of the food chain wrestlers.
It was terrible story.

1176
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:48,630
I almost went to the,
I think I'm pretty sure I almost went to

1177
00:58:48,631 --> 00:58:53,631
the match Schultes Mark Schultz,
Mark Schultz wrestling camp back when I 

1178
00:58:54,541 --> 00:58:57,060
was in high school.
I went to the Ohio state one instead.

1179
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,840
He fought,
gathered big daddy,

1180
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:02,560
big daddy Goodrich,
uh,

1181
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:07,770
in the UFC way back in the day.
It was his one and only a mma fight in 

1182
00:59:08,561 --> 00:59:13,561
the UFC.
And it's really interesting because in 

1183
00:59:13,561 --> 00:59:14,770
the movie that they did with Steve 
Carell,

1184
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:17,200
like that's a historical moments,
he,

1185
00:59:17,201 --> 00:59:21,650
they don't understand mma.
So when they made that movie,

1186
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:23,750
the cage fighting par was like,
yeah,

1187
00:59:23,751 --> 00:59:25,370
whatever,
we'll just fucking fudge this.

1188
00:59:25,371 --> 00:59:26,450
Like,
how do I,

1189
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:31,510
why would I believe that anything in 
that movie is what really happened when 

1190
00:59:32,331 --> 00:59:35,450
the thing that I know for sure really 
happened.

1191
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:37,400
You fucked up.
Yeah.

1192
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:41,240
The thing that I know for sure really 
happen is this guy,

1193
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,630
big daddy goodrich.
Wow.

1194
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:49,670
Fought Schultz when Schultz was a top of
the food chain wrestler man.

1195
00:59:49,671 --> 00:59:52,420
And he just took him down at.
Will he,

1196
00:59:52,421 --> 00:59:55,270
he handled him at will,
he took show?

1197
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,350
No.
Oh No,

1198
00:59:56,351 --> 00:59:56,920
no,
no,

1199
00:59:56,921 --> 00:59:57,440
no,
no,

1200
00:59:57,441 --> 00:59:58,040
no,
no,

1201
00:59:58,041 --> 00:59:58,250
no.

1202
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:00,470
There'll be none of that.
There'll be none of that.

1203
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:03,670
Mark Schultz was a go rilla.
Yeah.

1204
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:06,590
I mean,
just like I said,

1205
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:08,960
top of the food chain,
American wrestler.

1206
01:00:08,961 --> 01:00:10,740
He's a fucking tank.
Yeah.

1207
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:13,690
And so this is him fighting Gary 
Goodrich.

1208
01:00:13,691 --> 01:00:16,490
Let like very little striking fairy 
little striking trade.

1209
01:00:16,491 --> 01:00:17,690
He's just looking for this.
He says.

1210
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,090
And once he gets this,
Oh fuck all loud,

1211
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:22,820
boom.
Takes him to the ground like he's a sack

1212
01:00:22,821 --> 01:00:24,940
of potatoes,
beats the shit out of a mountain,

1213
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:26,870
does whatever he wants to.
When he has him on the ground,

1214
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:32,280
whatever he wants to him.
It's a level of grappling that the UFC 

1215
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,950
up until then had never seen.
You know.

1216
01:00:33,951 --> 01:00:37,190
It's like if a guy like Daniel cormier 
entry into the octagon back there,

1217
01:00:37,191 --> 01:00:40,790
same kind of thing,
just takes everybody's going down,

1218
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:45,970
shut the fuck up.
There's not going to be any stuff in 

1219
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:45,970
these take downs.

1220
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:46,890
There's a guy named Jordan burroughs out
there that I would.

1221
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:50,450
What's added to stop that right there 
because it was different times,

1222
01:00:50,451 --> 01:00:52,870
man.
It was a fact then.

1223
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:53,870
Yeah,
they would.

1224
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:55,880
They didn't know what the fuck they're 
doing half the time.

1225
01:00:55,881 --> 01:00:57,140
Like look,
Mark Scott,

1226
01:00:57,141 --> 01:00:59,330
no gloves on and Gary's got no gloves 
on,

1227
01:00:59,331 --> 01:01:02,330
but back in the day you could wear 
gloves if you wanted to.

1228
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,700
And I think he has shoes on.
Yup.

1229
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:06,050
He's got wrestling shoes and look at 
this.

1230
01:01:06,051 --> 01:01:11,051
Boom.
I mean every time he wants to he could 

1231
01:01:11,051 --> 01:01:13,931
take him down there in these mountain.
This is just a level of grappling that 

1232
01:01:13,931 --> 01:01:16,370
you just don't understand.
You're not getting them off.

1233
01:01:16,371 --> 01:01:18,650
You stop.
Stop.

1234
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,720
This is nonsense.
You don't even understand.

1235
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:25,930
This is like a big daddy goodrich I 
should just say is a incredibly strong 

1236
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:28,700
guy and an awesome athlete.
What's happening here?

1237
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,880
Tap.
It's like what happened?

1238
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:32,330
Big John.
Oh,

1239
01:01:32,331 --> 01:01:34,710
did he key lock them?
Is that what he's.

1240
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:42,640
That's interesting.
Why did I have in my head I had that he 

1241
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,060
beat him up and want a decision.
What happened?

1242
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:44,810
How did,
how did that resolve?

1243
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,500
Did submit him?
No,

1244
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:51,350
I can't believe I remember this wrong.
Well,

1245
01:01:51,351 --> 01:01:53,850
either way.
I just remember just watching.

1246
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:54,700
Yeah.
It looks like you've got.

1247
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:59,710
I'm going to key lock too much blood.
Oh No.

1248
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:03,660
Okay.
It wasn't that they just stopped it.

1249
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:08,510
Okay,
so it was a stoppage.

1250
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:09,980
Either way.

1251
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,760
There's a guy named Jordan burroughs who
when he wrestles,

1252
01:02:12,761 --> 01:02:15,670
he has these the greatest double leg 
take down ever.

1253
01:02:15,671 --> 01:02:19,470
Just shoot slow drives in his opponents 
and now he's going to it.

1254
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:25,520
He's won multiple gold side.
I mean he's just a monster and I would 

1255
01:02:25,921 --> 01:02:27,180
love,
love,

1256
01:02:27,181 --> 01:02:32,181
love to see him.
Learn how to strike a little bit or 

1257
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:35,391
learn some Jujitsu and figure out.
You have to see because in like almost 

1258
01:02:35,391 --> 01:02:37,890
the history of wrestling,
this guy is a freak.

1259
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:40,170
Shoots slow.
There's nothing you can do.

1260
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:43,100
Here he is,
there's just nothing.

1261
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,820
He just dominates people.
Serious drive,

1262
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:46,470
man.
Boom,

1263
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:48,330
boom.
Over and over again.

1264
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,970
Just destroys people over that drive.
Man.

1265
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:54,140
God Damn.
He's good.

1266
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:56,800
He wrestled on like time square.
Did you see that?

1267
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:57,890
That's cool.
Yeah.

1268
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,550
I wrestled in Times Square last year.
Maybe like in the winter.

1269
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:03,170
Oh really?
Oh Wow.

1270
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:05,150
Look at that.
Where is that guy going?

1271
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:06,980
Nowhere.
Well,

1272
01:03:06,981 --> 01:03:11,981
you know,
this is what we're seeing with Habib 

1273
01:03:11,981 --> 01:03:14,111
number.
Go off when you see like the super high 

1274
01:03:14,111 --> 01:03:14,111
level striking or excuse me,
excuse me,

1275
01:03:14,111 --> 01:03:15,540
super high level.
Grappling it,

1276
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,080
it shuts down.
Even like really good grapplers.

1277
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:19,360
Is this him and time square?
Yeah.

1278
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:21,020
Wow.
This is awesome.

1279
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:22,130
Who is he wrestling again?

1280
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,530
Some guy that thought he was about to 
get points right there.

1281
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:26,600
That's amazing.

1282
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,960
Who is he wrestling against?
Does it say,

1283
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:37,070
oh,
it's got some rap music on it that'll 

1284
01:03:37,070 --> 01:03:38,941
get us kicked off youtube,
but this is all these are like world 

1285
01:03:38,941 --> 01:03:40,360
championships and stuff.
Crazy man.

1286
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:45,340
Serious power and technique.
I just.

1287
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:48,280
I think that's the most important skill 
in mma.

1288
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:54,110
I've always thought it and I still do 
because I think these guys can learn 

1289
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:57,480
defense for grappling defense,
for Jujitsu and they can learn 

1290
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:01,711
submissions,
which is probably even more important 

1291
01:04:01,711 --> 01:04:05,070
way quicker than a regular person.
They're so used to squeezing shit 

1292
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:08,431
already.
They're used to like constantly used to 

1293
01:04:08,431 --> 01:04:10,750
squeezing things in gripping and polling
and unlike Jujitsu with the GE,

1294
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:14,710
which relies a lot of it on grips and 
like there's an entanglement factor that

1295
01:04:14,711 --> 01:04:19,711
you have to really take into account and
they can really slow the game down that 

1296
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:19,711
way.
You can't do that with wrestling.

1297
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:24,390
Now.
The thing with wrestling's hip movement 

1298
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:26,470
and hip control and spinning around a 
guy room from hitting a easy reversal 

1299
01:04:27,111 --> 01:04:29,300
just from popping down and back up.
Yeah.

1300
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:30,440
Yeah.
If you don't wrestle,

1301
01:04:30,441 --> 01:04:32,150
you're not taking a wrestler down.
Yeah.

1302
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:34,370
And it's crazy sometimes watching,
you know,

1303
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:38,060
high level fights and you know,
sometimes I don't have,

1304
01:04:38,061 --> 01:04:39,950
obviously when we're a year at a live 
fight,

1305
01:04:39,951 --> 01:04:44,390
I don't have the audio.
So it's like sometimes I'm seeing what's

1306
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:47,000
just a little thing that's wrong,
you know,

1307
01:04:47,001 --> 01:04:50,390
like for example like in de Asma Gregor 
too,

1308
01:04:50,391 --> 01:04:53,230
I remember a part where Diaz was trying 
to take my.

1309
01:04:53,231 --> 01:04:58,231
Greg are down,
but his hips were above Mcgregor's who 

1310
01:04:58,231 --> 01:04:59,810
had dropped his just lower.
Whereas if Diaz pops down and back up,

1311
01:04:59,811 --> 01:05:01,400
he's got them.
But you know,

1312
01:05:01,401 --> 01:05:06,401
all this stuff's happening at once and 
sometimes you can see it with wrestling 

1313
01:05:06,401 --> 01:05:10,331
and it's just the difference in a little
thing that sometimes the energy and the 

1314
01:05:10,331 --> 01:05:11,060
emotions of the fight,
it's about,

1315
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:12,320
you know,
just being like,

1316
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:13,940
oh yeah,
drop down up and like,

1317
01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:14,360
you know.

1318
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:16,260
Yeah,
yeah.

1319
01:05:16,261 --> 01:05:17,860
It's uh,
it's very,

1320
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:21,580
very technique oriented and that's like 
the people that have never done any kind

1321
01:05:21,581 --> 01:05:25,990
of grappling don't understand when 
you're watching someone drive in,

1322
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:29,350
when you see a beautiful.
Like if you go back to like,

1323
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:34,890
who's got one of the best power doubles?
Probably may Frankie Edgar's got one of 

1324
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:39,691
my favorite power doubles ever.
He takes a lot of motherfuckers down 

1325
01:05:39,691 --> 01:05:42,430
that'll really tough to take down,
but if you watch as he enters into it,

1326
01:05:42,431 --> 01:05:44,430
there's such a flow to it.
You know?

1327
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:48,400
It's an aggressive attacking like George
St Pierre when George was in his prime.

1328
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:53,550
Oh,
do everybody's scared of that takedown 

1329
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:53,550
man.
That power double was coming.

1330
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:57,960
Josh Koscheck when early on in the sport
will Josh Koscheck had ridiculous power 

1331
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:00,340
and his in his takedowns just 
ridiculous.

1332
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:01,750
He would just drive through you.

1333
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:04,720
It's so technical.
There's one.

1334
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:09,750
That's the whole thing in wrestling is 
strength and quickness and all this 

1335
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:13,360
stuff is so secondary to some dude 
that'll own you doing your own thing.

1336
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:15,280
He'll wrestle Jujitsu.
You,

1337
01:06:15,281 --> 01:06:20,281
he'll just let you think that you're 
about to do something while these moves 

1338
01:06:20,281 --> 01:06:20,281
ahead.

1339
01:06:20,281 --> 01:06:24,750
I think everybody should know that Yoel 
Romero is a real human being like that.

1340
01:06:24,751 --> 01:06:27,990
That's possible.
Like everyone should know.

1341
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:30,210
Like when it comes to like what's what's
important about wrestling.

1342
01:06:30,450 --> 01:06:34,680
Yoel Romero is a real thing.
Like that's what happens.

1343
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:37,820
That's just what you have when you have 
the elite is a leader.

1344
01:06:37,821 --> 01:06:40,140
Wrestlers you can get in a super athlete
body.

1345
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:41,430
Yeah,
good luck.

1346
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:42,690
Yeah,
good luck.

1347
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:46,020
He decides whether you're going down.
You mean if you take them down?

1348
01:06:46,021 --> 01:06:47,190
It's luck.
I mean,

1349
01:06:47,191 --> 01:06:52,191
he might've been half ass that takedown 
defense because he knows as soon as it 

1350
01:06:52,191 --> 01:06:52,950
gets down and just fucking flip you over
and stand back up again.

1351
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:55,590
It's not the same kind of thing.

1352
01:06:56,280 --> 01:07:01,280
He's just way more athletic than you.
Stronger than you.

1353
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:03,810
They need to get into gonoodle.
Workout with him,

1354
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:05,250
dude.
Well,

1355
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:10,280
when the gun is way too heavy,
unfortunately you're dealing with 85 

1356
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:10,700
versus heavyweight,
but at 85.

1357
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:12,580
No,
I mean like trained to train with them.

1358
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:16,560
It's a big guy to train with.
He's so good.

1359
01:07:16,561 --> 01:07:17,960
Dude.
Is this this highlight reel?

1360
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:20,100
Do Peace.
He's so good.

1361
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:25,800
He's knocked out with stunning accuracy.
Luke rockhold.

1362
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:28,860
I'm Chris Weidman.
Look at that.

1363
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,180
Boom.
Dude.

1364
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:32,640
Tim Kennedy.
I mean,

1365
01:07:32,641 --> 01:07:35,670
he's a fucking monster.
Although the Kennedy fight was marred by

1366
01:07:35,671 --> 01:07:37,890
controversy.
You can never ignore that.

1367
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:40,390
He did not come out for the.
Oh,

1368
01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:45,410
look at that left hand.
He did not come out for the for the end 

1369
01:07:45,410 --> 01:07:48,420
of the round and he was still sitting on
a stool and a day wasted.

1370
01:07:48,421 --> 01:07:53,100
All this time trying to give him more 
chances to recover.

1371
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:58,400
You have to be afraid of any guy who's 
shoulders stick up like that.

1372
01:07:58,760 --> 01:07:59,270
Dude.
He's.

1373
01:07:59,330 --> 01:08:01,100
He's terrified.
It's like a King Cobra.

1374
01:08:01,101 --> 01:08:04,980
How it like warns you with its wings.
He stopped up.

1375
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:08,820
This dude with body stroll.
I mean that is crazy.

1376
01:08:08,821 --> 01:08:13,821
Who the fuck?
Stop someone with driving elbows to the 

1377
01:08:13,821 --> 01:08:14,280
body.
Who the fuck stop somebody with that?

1378
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:15,620
Oh.
Oh my God.

1379
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:16,640
Yeah,
Dude.

1380
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:19,070
I mean that was meat.
He made meat out of that.

1381
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,720
Go back to that.
Let me look at that again.

1382
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:26,740
That's crazy.
Yeah,

1383
01:08:26,761 --> 01:08:31,761
we'll just look at right there.
Right there with her and they'll show 

1384
01:08:31,761 --> 01:08:31,761
it.
He's got blood all over his elbow.

1385
01:08:31,761 --> 01:08:33,860
The just.
That is a crazy.

1386
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:39,640
His whole face is a mess,
but that's a crazy amount of force this 

1387
01:08:39,891 --> 01:08:44,360
guy can generate and wrestling is just 
another level man.

1388
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:45,740
Like that kind of shit.
Yeah.

1389
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:50,980
He could do that to anybody,
like he fought Brad Tavares right there 

1390
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:55,750
and Brad [inaudible] stud and it was 
like they were nowhere near the same 

1391
01:08:56,871 --> 01:08:58,550
weight class,
like the way you can handle them.

1392
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:05,490
He's just so fucking powerful and this 
is just shows you what a fucking Stud 

1393
01:09:05,490 --> 01:09:07,600
Tim Kennedy is.
Tim Kennedy almost had them.

1394
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:12,390
The reason why he didn't come out for,
I believe it was the third round when it

1395
01:09:12,391 --> 01:09:14,890
came out late was because by the end of 
the second,

1396
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:17,200
Tim had them in deep,
deep trouble.

1397
01:09:18,370 --> 01:09:21,920
Tim had caught him with a couple of big 
punches and staggered them and so when,

1398
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:26,930
when he went back to his corner,
look at that fucking shot that he lands 

1399
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:27,100
when he knocks him down.
Then another one,

1400
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:32,610
he just smashed them at the end.
The craziest thing about Tim Kennedy is 

1401
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:37,360
he does all this and for a big chunk of 
his career he was a active military.

1402
01:09:39,730 --> 01:09:40,780
It's still fighting like that.

1403
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,430
Yeah,
you all Ramiro is.

1404
01:09:44,431 --> 01:09:46,470
Yeah,
and here's him just smashing the ODA.

1405
01:09:46,471 --> 01:09:51,471
Machida he's terrifying.
So he's going to get the next shot at 

1406
01:09:51,471 --> 01:09:52,170
the middleweight title after you just 
knocked out luke rockhold.

1407
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:58,790
I can't believe political knocked him.
That's the crazy thing is knocked him 

1408
01:09:58,790 --> 01:10:01,641
out like this is the crazy thing.
You're talking about a guy who's like 

1409
01:10:01,641 --> 01:10:02,670
one of the best wrestlers to ever fight 
in mma and he's knocking people out,

1410
01:10:02,730 --> 01:10:05,130
standing,
leaping in and crack and you would punch

1411
01:10:05,131 --> 01:10:07,830
is hitting you at flying knees,
knocking out world champions.

1412
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:10,290
Mikaela,
Chris Weidman with a flying knee.

1413
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:11,680
He's uh,
he's just,

1414
01:10:12,030 --> 01:10:16,860
he's on another level,
like a real fucking monster athlete.

1415
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:22,130
Like it's a pleasure to get to watch 
someone who has such fantastic technique

1416
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:30,230
and physical attributes all combined.
Like his wrestling technique is just 

1417
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:33,370
ridiculously good.
His timing's ridiculously good.

1418
01:10:33,371 --> 01:10:36,240
It's explosions,
so like to watch that,

1419
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:41,540
I mean for me,
a guy who's been around the sport for a 

1420
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:41,540
long time.

1421
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:43,260
When a guy comes out and it just stands 
out that hard,

1422
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:44,910
you go,
Whoa,

1423
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:47,850
this guy is a real outlier.
Physically,

1424
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:51,120
he's going to make such a good progress.
Learn a few years.

1425
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:53,010
Oh,
if he does decide to do that,

1426
01:10:53,070 --> 01:10:54,840
fuck yeah,
he would make an amazing one.

1427
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:56,910
Yes.
As he gets older.

1428
01:10:56,970 --> 01:10:57,710
Yeah,
look at it.

1429
01:10:57,730 --> 01:10:59,100
Are they stretching them out here?
Yeah,

1430
01:10:59,101 --> 01:11:01,590
he's super fucking flexible,
dude.

1431
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:06,120
You mean he's a product of the Cuban 
wrestling system and if you listen to my

1432
01:11:06,121 --> 01:11:11,121
podcast with Matt Brown,
I'm going to plug that one more time 

1433
01:11:11,121 --> 01:11:14,601
because I enjoy the shit out of it.
It was one of the MMA shows I did last 

1434
01:11:14,601 --> 01:11:18,260
week with Matt Brown and he and I were 
talking about it and he's um,

1435
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:20,780
like,
uh,

1436
01:11:20,850 --> 01:11:25,280
he spent an entire six weeks,
I believe in Cuba at one of his,

1437
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:30,281
uh,
his training camps and the way these 

1438
01:11:30,281 --> 01:11:32,610
people live and trained like they are,
they are all in man.

1439
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:36,480
They're all in and there's just a 
tremendous amount of talent over there,

1440
01:11:36,481 --> 01:11:41,481
both in boxing and in judo as well as 
wrestling,

1441
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:43,560
taekwondo.
They have a big taekwondo team,

1442
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:46,230
like Cuba doesn't fuck around 
athletically,

1443
01:11:46,231 --> 01:11:49,110
man,
but it's just to see a guy like that and

1444
01:11:49,111 --> 01:11:50,130
you go,
wow,

1445
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:56,300
that's a net 40.
Like what would that guy have been like 

1446
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:56,850
when he was 30?
Good Lord.

1447
01:11:56,851 --> 01:11:58,170
He's 40.
He's 40.

1448
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:03,260
Yeah.
What would he have been better if we'd 

1449
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:05,181
been faster now on top of all that,
Robert Whitaker's still beat them with a

1450
01:12:05,611 --> 01:12:06,840
blown out knee.
Yup.

1451
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:09,070
That's amazing.
Whitaker,

1452
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:11,550
Monster.
That shows you how amazing he is.

1453
01:12:11,551 --> 01:12:16,551
Yeah.
He's still managed to take takedowns of 

1454
01:12:16,551 --> 01:12:16,551
the compete.
Completely blown out knee.

1455
01:12:16,551 --> 01:12:16,860
Crazy.
Yeah.

1456
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:21,950
Whittaker is no fucking joke.
He's a scary guy and he's getting 

1457
01:12:21,950 --> 01:12:23,100
better.
I think Whitaker's is only like 27.

1458
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:25,050
Right?
How old is Robert Whitaker?

1459
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:30,800
That sounds about right.
He's one of the younger guys that's a 

1460
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:31,980
world champion currently I believe.
Twenty seven.

1461
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:34,440
Yeah.
So he's still growing and learning,

1462
01:12:34,441 --> 01:12:37,620
man.
That guy at at 30.

1463
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,080
I mean he's a world champion right now 
at 30.

1464
01:12:40,081 --> 01:12:41,340
He's going to be better than he is right
now.

1465
01:12:41,930 --> 01:12:43,050
It's just going to keep getting better.

1466
01:12:43,310 --> 01:12:48,310
Another thing is your well didn't show 
any of the signs of pain from the Shin 

1467
01:12:50,151 --> 01:12:52,940
injury that he had.
That's a big part of it too,

1468
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,100
you know,
is not letting your opponent know what's

1469
01:12:55,101 --> 01:13:00,101
hurting you because I'm sure if rockhold
knew that he hurt his shin more than he 

1470
01:13:00,101 --> 01:13:04,661
heard his,
then he would have kept picking away at 

1471
01:13:04,661 --> 01:13:04,661
it.
But he didn't let him know.

1472
01:13:04,661 --> 01:13:07,160
So it just seemed like he wasn't 
affecting them with his leg kicks.

1473
01:13:07,161 --> 01:13:08,230
Meanwhile,
urls like,

1474
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:13,680
oh,
what does he like?

1475
01:13:14,570 --> 01:13:16,910
Oh yeah,
painful.

1476
01:13:16,970 --> 01:13:18,620
Well,
he's a super winter.

1477
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:21,350
He's what you would call a super winter,
you know,

1478
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,500
I mean,
that's really what it is.

1479
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:28,440
If you get these Olympic level athletes 
that had just been competing their whole

1480
01:13:29,961 --> 01:13:32,660
lives,
they just not a win.

1481
01:13:32,690 --> 01:13:35,690
And when he learned at a strike,
everybody just,

1482
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,190
you're,
you're fucked.

1483
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:42,250
You got this guy.
There's only been a few guys that can 

1484
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:42,250
survive it,
that had been able to survive it,

1485
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:46,850
you know,
but the most impressive one,

1486
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:49,160
um,
I mean,

1487
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:51,500
shit,
there's just,

1488
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:54,230
this is a,
a real wealth of talent right now

1489
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:57,880
going to say it's a very exciting time 
to be a UFC fan.

1490
01:13:58,070 --> 01:13:59,440
It really is labeled bubble

1491
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:04,330
because like Robert Whitaker was the 
first guy to.

1492
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:09,400
Is he the first guy to beat in the UFC?
I want to say he is and I want to say 

1493
01:14:12,701 --> 01:14:13,810
that Yo,
well,

1494
01:14:13,811 --> 01:14:18,811
last,
like one of his really early mma fights 

1495
01:14:18,811 --> 01:14:21,940
to fazio in strikeforce.
Is that true?

1496
01:14:24,910 --> 01:14:27,130
How fail content?
Yeah,

1497
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:31,830
it's strikeforce Barnett versus a 
Keratin off surrogate car off.

1498
01:14:31,831 --> 01:14:35,260
So that was like way back in 2011.
So yeah,

1499
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:37,210
look,
it was one of his first fights.

1500
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:40,660
He lost that fight and he lost a 
whitticker so he hadn't lost since that.

1501
01:14:40,661 --> 01:14:41,920
Uh,
the faceoff fight,

1502
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:47,710
almost all knockouts and the only one 
that has an asterisk right next to it is

1503
01:14:47,711 --> 01:14:50,200
the Tim Kennedy fight because it was 
def.

1504
01:14:50,201 --> 01:14:52,300
Definitely some fuckery there.
Definitely some,

1505
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:55,600
some cheat and definitely stayed on that
stool.

1506
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:59,020
An extra few seconds.
How long did they wind up staying on the

1507
01:14:59,021 --> 01:15:04,021
stool for extra?
I want to guess it was an extra 15 

1508
01:15:04,021 --> 01:15:06,360
seconds.
I think that might be a.

1509
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,560
What did he do?
He just chill for a bit.

1510
01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:11,140
Might've been less than 15.
Uh,

1511
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,140
he just didn't get up.
He sat there.

1512
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:14,100
The end.
Yeah.

1513
01:15:14,101 --> 01:15:15,540
Dan was around.
He was in there.

1514
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,210
The corner was leaving.
He's still sitting on a stool.

1515
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:20,040
Data oximetry.
Thirty seconds.

1516
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:21,930
Thirty seconds.
That's a long time.

1517
01:15:21,931 --> 01:15:26,931
It's a long time.
I was thinking it was 15 and I was 

1518
01:15:26,931 --> 01:15:27,780
thinking I might've,
I might've been wrong.

1519
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:28,530
It might have been 10.

1520
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,980
They didn't even try a trick like the 
old spill.

1521
01:15:30,981 --> 01:15:32,270
The ice,
that classic,

1522
01:15:32,271 --> 01:15:33,440
which I love so much.

1523
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:36,560
Dude.
Thirty seconds is a long time for guy to

1524
01:15:36,561 --> 01:15:37,340
recover.
You could.

1525
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:40,100
He could have easily been code.
He could have.

1526
01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:45,190
I mean,
who knows because he's such a super 

1527
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:45,190
athlete.
He might've been able to rebound,

1528
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:46,910
but he might not have to.
We'll never know

1529
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:51,980
if you're taking 30 seconds you're 
taking it because 20 seconds wasn't 

1530
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:51,980
enough.

1531
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:52,580
Yeah,
well it's.

1532
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:58,140
Yeah,
well it would be an minute at that 

1533
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:00,331
point.
There's a minute and 32nd break on top 

1534
01:16:00,331 --> 01:16:03,751
of that.
So it was a minute 30 for from the time 

1535
01:16:03,751 --> 01:16:05,470
Tim was beating on him until the time 
the round ends.

1536
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:08,170
He goes back to his corner,
clearly fucked up,

1537
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,390
and then he sits on the stool for a long
time.

1538
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:15,420
It's a,
it's a 100 percent of an and an 

1539
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:15,420
asterisk.
Asterisk.

1540
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:17,420
Do you ever say that word right?
Asterisk asked her.

1541
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:22,550
It always sounds wrong.
It's like when George Bush used to say 

1542
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:22,550
especially,
and he would say,

1543
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:26,930
especially the Vaseline,
does that have anything to do with it?

1544
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:29,810
Sit on them.
And they tried to get the trainer in and

1545
01:16:29,811 --> 01:16:31,220
he couldn't understand what they were 
saying.

1546
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:34,040
Is that what it was?
That's what this and this year.

1547
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:34,830
And I said,
yeah,

1548
01:16:34,850 --> 01:16:37,310
but he was sitting there.
He was sitting there and they didn't.

1549
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:40,000
And Tim Kennedy standing there,
the rounds over and he's got his arms up

1550
01:16:40,001 --> 01:16:45,001
there and see if you could play that on.
You played out or they'll get us kicked 

1551
01:16:45,001 --> 01:16:45,001
off.
I don't have to find it.

1552
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:46,360
Okay.
Don't worry about it.

1553
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:47,830
You don't have to find it.
Um,

1554
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:51,480
but that's the only one.
Next is name.

1555
01:16:51,490 --> 01:16:52,400
Where are you to go?
Ooh,

1556
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:58,450
you know that one.
That one a good can't take on 32nd 

1557
01:16:58,450 --> 01:16:58,780
break.
Yeah,

1558
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:00,310
that's not good.
But,

1559
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,560
and he wound up winning that fight,
which is man,

1560
01:17:02,561 --> 01:17:05,200
that's a that there's a major violation 
there.

1561
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:10,260
That's a,
a giant like not being ready for the 

1562
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:14,891
start of the next round.
If you have the round starts like you 

1563
01:17:14,891 --> 01:17:18,851
don't want,
the referee doesn't want to stop the 

1564
01:17:18,851 --> 01:17:20,831
fight,
he doesn't want to give it to your 

1565
01:17:20,831 --> 01:17:20,831
opponent because you can't start the 
round on time.

1566
01:17:20,831 --> 01:17:23,660
But he's in a terrible situation where 
he wants to fight to continue.

1567
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:28,870
But he also understands that you're 
taking unfair advantage here by just 

1568
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:29,120
sitting here while you should be 
engaging in a contest.

1569
01:17:29,121 --> 01:17:32,720
There's a specified one minute break.
You've exceeded your one minute break.

1570
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:35,180
Therefore I must disqualify you.
So they're stuck.

1571
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:38,240
They're stuck in no man's land.
They don't want to be the party pooper.

1572
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:41,410
You just get Yowell up real quick.
Like he's,

1573
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:44,750
he's just in the 30 seconds later.
He finally.

1574
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:47,130
What?
How,

1575
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,370
how?
That's a big one,

1576
01:17:49,371 --> 01:17:50,870
man.
I didn't know it was 30 seconds.

1577
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:52,820
I really thought it was 15 or less.

1578
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:59,300
But take that away because you know,
that's unfortunate,

1579
01:17:59,301 --> 01:18:04,301
but shit happens.
Take that away and you're looking at 

1580
01:18:04,301 --> 01:18:07,880
just a freak.
The freak of freaks to come in.

1581
01:18:07,881 --> 01:18:11,720
Here he is with Joey Diaz.
Yes.

1582
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:15,740
Joe is going to help translate.
So if everything,

1583
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:20,830
like if everything's going smooth or 
maybe he doesn't understand what I'm 

1584
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:20,830
saying,
he might turn to Joey and they'll,

1585
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:21,880
we'll abide by law,
by law though.

1586
01:18:21,890 --> 01:18:23,420
Shit.
Just fucking throw their hands up.

1587
01:18:23,530 --> 01:18:25,220
Air.
Just each other and shit.

1588
01:18:25,221 --> 01:18:30,221
And then we'll be back in business.
Be surprised if you all can get these 

1589
01:18:30,221 --> 01:18:32,330
headphones on over his shoulders.
Those,

1590
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:34,790
I know he's a tank.
I don't know.

1591
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:39,810
Um,
I don't know how much he wants to talk 

1592
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:40,790
about his life in Cuba and what it was 
like,

1593
01:18:40,810 --> 01:18:45,810
like wrestling there.
But I would be utterly fascinated to 

1594
01:18:45,810 --> 01:18:45,810
hear about that,
you know,

1595
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:51,160
and to rise to the top of the heap in 
that crazy shark tank of athletic talent

1596
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:57,550
and then go onto metal and like 
basically every wrestling championship 

1597
01:18:57,550 --> 01:18:58,070
that he entered into nationally.

1598
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,920
I mean it's just one of the freak of 
freaks.

1599
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:03,890
Yeah.
Fascinating that those guys exist.

1600
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:08,920
And I think it's so important that we 
know because everybody has these ideas 

1601
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:12,170
in their head about like physical 
limitations and physical capabilities.

1602
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:16,910
And then you see like a,
like a Walter Payton and you just go,

1603
01:19:16,970 --> 01:19:18,580
oh whoa,
like,

1604
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:22,820
how's this guy or Herschel Walker?
Herschel Walker is a great example.

1605
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:28,040
You see,
you see Herschel Walker run and you'd 

1606
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:28,040
go,
Oh,

1607
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:29,220
what?
That's the person too crazy.

1608
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:35,200
How has that guy mean?
Herschel Walker to this day is super 

1609
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:39,521
jacked and he's in his fifties.
That was him in his late forties 

1610
01:19:39,521 --> 01:19:39,710
fighting in strikeforce.
Look at that.

1611
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:42,230
Fifty four wants to fight again.
Is this new?

1612
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:45,260
Come on.
Seriously,

1613
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:47,630
June 2016.
So two years ago.

1614
01:19:47,631 --> 01:19:49,400
So now he's 56.
Wants to fight against.

1615
01:19:49,401 --> 01:19:52,730
Still Open the rampage bad.
He's open to a rampage.

1616
01:19:52,731 --> 01:19:54,650
Jackson.
He's so crazy.

1617
01:19:54,651 --> 01:19:56,670
He might win.
Dude.

1618
01:19:57,110 --> 01:20:00,030
Hershel Walker's terrifying.
That's another what?

1619
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:04,430
Exactly the same thing.
We're talking about another insane level

1620
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:07,100
of physical talent above and beyond.

1621
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:10,030
He like all pushups only or something 
for awhile

1622
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,730
apparently.
That's a lot of what he did.

1623
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:16,760
A lot of what he did was push ups and a 
lot of body weight exercises and he 

1624
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:19,740
didn't really necessarily lift weights.
Who knows,

1625
01:20:19,741 --> 01:20:21,090
man,
he might be telling the truth,

1626
01:20:21,091 --> 01:20:25,380
but it seems like he looks like a guy 
who lifts weights,

1627
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:30,740
so vqv that jacked at 47 or 48 and not 
lift weights.

1628
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:35,790
This was 2011 from this photo.
That picture?

1629
01:20:35,791 --> 01:20:36,390
Yeah.
Okay.

1630
01:20:36,690 --> 01:20:37,680
So.
But you know,

1631
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:42,810
not a young man and ridiculously ripped 
and always has been.

1632
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,140
He's just as severe outlier.
There's like there's brock lesnar.

1633
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:46,810
Got It.
Yeah.

1634
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:49,780
There was a guy when Jamie and I were 
back in Columbus,

1635
01:20:49,781 --> 01:20:50,110
way,
way,

1636
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:50,980
way,
way,

1637
01:20:50,981 --> 01:20:54,760
way back named Maurice Colorado running 
back for Ohio state that only played one

1638
01:20:54,761 --> 01:20:59,761
year.
He was a freshman and broke every 

1639
01:20:59,761 --> 01:21:00,760
freshman record this and that led us to 
a national championship.

1640
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:03,490
Wasn't even that tall probably.
I don't know.

1641
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:04,270
Who knows,
whatever,

1642
01:21:04,271 --> 01:21:04,960
five,
10,

1643
01:21:04,961 --> 01:21:05,610
five,
nine,

1644
01:21:05,650 --> 01:21:08,140
something like,
not that tall,

1645
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:12,450
but he had thighs and hips that where he
would just keep running.

1646
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:15,790
He would just keep his legs moving and 
he would run people over.

1647
01:21:15,850 --> 01:21:16,840
Just boof.
Boof,

1648
01:21:16,841 --> 01:21:18,190
boof.
Smashing guys.

1649
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:22,390
Guys on the defense in our,
when we played them in high school,

1650
01:21:22,391 --> 01:21:27,391
he,
because he was right around the corner 

1651
01:21:27,391 --> 01:21:28,570
at Warren harding in youngstown and so 
we played them in high school.

1652
01:21:28,690 --> 01:21:32,830
Our guys were being taken off on 
stretchers on the defense guys trying to

1653
01:21:32,831 --> 01:21:35,920
tackle him stretcher stretcher 
stretcher.

1654
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:38,770
I'm not even kidding.
It was crazy.

1655
01:21:39,970 --> 01:21:40,900
Marise Claret.

1656
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:42,900
You see the.

1657
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:46,180
But he's a real human man.
Look at that.

1658
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,900
Isn't that crazy?
These are real.

1659
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:51,130
That's so much muscle.
Yeah.

1660
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:56,940
Um,
did you see that video of Brock Lesnar 

1661
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:56,940
punching that guy for real and a 
wrestling match?

1662
01:21:57,290 --> 01:21:59,510
He's done that quite a few times.
Sometimes.

1663
01:21:59,511 --> 01:22:04,511
Brock let's dudes know what's up.
If they don't do things right or if 

1664
01:22:04,511 --> 01:22:04,511
they're not,
you

1665
01:22:04,511 --> 01:22:05,120
need him in the face pretty hard.
Yeah.

1666
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:08,660
And his head snapped back and Brock 
crack this dude.

1667
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:11,090
Yeah.
Like with like real punches,

1668
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:15,110
like I'm going to hit you with real 
punches now I boom,

1669
01:22:15,111 --> 01:22:17,390
boom.
Sometimes a couple times on the jaw.

1670
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:22,540
That was an old car.
That's a hard fucking needed the head 

1671
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:25,940
and brackets up and you could see is 
very unhappy.

1672
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:29,000
Boom.
That's a real punch right there.

1673
01:22:29,001 --> 01:22:31,490
That is the kind of shit that he hit 
Frank Mir with.

1674
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:34,070
That's real.
Yeah.

1675
01:22:34,071 --> 01:22:37,670
They're playing big time ball.
That is a freak that guy,

1676
01:22:37,671 --> 01:22:42,671
man.
People think about him as a ww II guy 

1677
01:22:42,671 --> 01:22:43,460
and then they think about him as,
you know,

1678
01:22:43,461 --> 01:22:47,450
fighting in the UFC and winning some 
fights and being this bad motherfucker,

1679
01:22:47,451 --> 01:22:50,600
but they don't know when he beat chain 
car when.

1680
01:22:50,601 --> 01:22:53,390
I mean that was a big fucking fight for 
him to choke out Jane,

1681
01:22:53,391 --> 01:22:58,391
Carl Jane Corwin.
But what people don't realize is like 

1682
01:22:58,391 --> 01:23:00,830
when he was an amateur wrestler,
he was a fucking monster.

1683
01:23:00,890 --> 01:23:05,890
Yup.
It's just his decision to go into the 

1684
01:23:05,890 --> 01:23:06,520
UFC late after you'd been doing pro 
wrestling.

1685
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:08,230
People were like,
oh,

1686
01:23:08,231 --> 01:23:09,070
this guy.
But look,

1687
01:23:09,071 --> 01:23:14,071
this guy is a fucking unbelievable.
Athletes ever seen his nfl combine 

1688
01:23:14,711 --> 01:23:15,740
scores.
Now.

1689
01:23:16,190 --> 01:23:21,190
Can you see that Shit Jamie?
See if you could google is Shane car 

1690
01:23:21,190 --> 01:23:25,051
when versus brock lesnar combine because
somebody made a one of those images and 

1691
01:23:26,981 --> 01:23:30,250
it showed their numbers similar height,
similar weight.

1692
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:32,950
PROC was a fucking freak

1693
01:23:32,990 --> 01:23:35,090
can it shows in the wwe,
right?

1694
01:23:35,091 --> 01:23:35,900
You know,
people say,

1695
01:23:35,901 --> 01:23:37,820
you know,
I'm sure if it's fake,

1696
01:23:37,821 --> 01:23:42,050
but it's not because you can see that 
compared to all the other athletes,

1697
01:23:42,051 --> 01:23:44,450
some of them that only did that their 
entire lives,

1698
01:23:44,451 --> 01:23:49,451
his hit this number of strides that he 
takes longer and faster and you just see

1699
01:23:50,091 --> 01:23:53,570
him even from seat's far away.
You can see,

1700
01:23:53,930 --> 01:23:58,930
wow,
that guy is big and moving wave Jesus 

1701
01:23:58,930 --> 01:24:02,500
moving at the same speed as the.
The crazy luchador Mexican wrestlers 

1702
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:06,971
were earlier,
but he's that size with shoulders like 

1703
01:24:06,971 --> 01:24:06,971
that.

1704
01:24:06,971 --> 01:24:09,790
He had what I would call a fractured mma
training that led him to the heavyweight

1705
01:24:09,791 --> 01:24:14,791
champion and I say fractured that.
He jumped right into the deep end and 

1706
01:24:16,061 --> 01:24:19,630
won and beat guys like Randy coture beat
guys like Frank Mir.

1707
01:24:19,631 --> 01:24:24,631
Shane Carwyn beats him worldclass guys.
But if he had started I think earlier in

1708
01:24:28,031 --> 01:24:31,050
his life and learn how to strike and 
got.

1709
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:36,120
Got some of that in there first.
So there wasn't such an alien thing to 

1710
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:39,481
him when he was fighting in the big 
leagues was really unlimited striking 

1711
01:24:39,481 --> 01:24:41,761
for a few years.
If he learned that a strike from a real 

1712
01:24:41,761 --> 01:24:42,550
technical instructor,
someone was real tactical,

1713
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:45,160
instill,
still had that wrestling ability when he

1714
01:24:45,161 --> 01:24:45,850
was younger,
they would.

1715
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,830
I mean,
who the fuck else is like that?

1716
01:24:48,130 --> 01:24:49,780
Who else is like that?
When we got.

1717
01:24:49,781 --> 01:24:53,140
I mean he was in his thirties already.
He'd been doing progress in a long time.

1718
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:55,330
It beats the shit out of your body.
You might think it's fake.

1719
01:24:55,480 --> 01:25:00,480
There's nothing fake about when he 
flipped over the top rope and landed on 

1720
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:00,550
his head.
I remember that one.

1721
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:01,750
That salt.
Yeah.

1722
01:25:01,751 --> 01:25:03,640
That's not fake.
Try faking that.

1723
01:25:03,641 --> 01:25:05,440
Your debt.
Most people are dead from that.

1724
01:25:05,490 --> 01:25:10,490
Yeah.
He survived and kept going with the 

1725
01:25:10,490 --> 01:25:10,490
wrestling moves like this is not a 
normal athlete,

1726
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:15,340
but every now and then one of those guys
comes along and if they can,

1727
01:25:15,950 --> 01:25:18,160
if they.
I mean obviously brock was very tactical

1728
01:25:18,161 --> 01:25:20,860
when he was in high school and when he 
was a young wrestler,

1729
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:21,700
his,
his.

1730
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:27,300
If you watch some of the videos of him 
when he was a younger guy who was 

1731
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:27,490
slightly smaller,
he was definitely a smaller guy,

1732
01:25:27,491 --> 01:25:29,860
but he still was a gorilla.
I mean,

1733
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:32,410
there's nothing,
there's no getting around that genetics,

1734
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:38,000
you know,
but it's rare that a guy like that at 

1735
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:38,650
him,
you know,

1736
01:25:38,651 --> 01:25:43,651
can reach the level where you seeing a 
Yoel Romero because like,

1737
01:25:46,241 --> 01:25:49,450
that's almost like another level even 
past what brock's capable of doing.

1738
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,660
Brock's.
I can't find Shane's numbers.

1739
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:55,420
40 yard dash time.
Four point seven.

1740
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:59,110
Vertical jump.
30 five standing long jump.

1741
01:25:59,290 --> 01:26:00,460
Ten feet.
Whoa.

1742
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:03,920
He can stand and jump 10 feet forward.

1743
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,320
And he's 265 pounds.
Bench press,

1744
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:10,730
225 pounds for 30 reps.
40 yard dash time.

1745
01:26:10,731 --> 01:26:11,830
Four point seven.
Vertical jump.

1746
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:14,120
What does this was a tune on the wire 
repeated.

1747
01:26:14,121 --> 01:26:14,930
Okay.
Okay.

1748
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:15,770
Oh,
I see.

1749
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:16,930
Okay.
So that's.

1750
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,470
That was the last APP was the bench 
press?

1751
01:26:18,471 --> 01:26:20,720
Two hundred 25 pound bench press for 30 
reps.

1752
01:26:20,721 --> 01:26:22,520
that's a lot of fucking reps,
man.

1753
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:27,260
That's crazy.
But I know there's guys who do more than

1754
01:26:27,261 --> 01:26:32,261
that.
It's a similar thing I could find was a 

1755
01:26:32,261 --> 01:26:34,630
forum.
It said that Shane did like 43 reps on 

1756
01:26:34,630 --> 01:26:34,630
that,
but I couldn't find it.

1757
01:26:34,630 --> 01:26:34,630
Stats.
Oh,

1758
01:26:34,630 --> 01:26:38,000
so you did more bench press.
What is a world record in the combine or

1759
01:26:38,001 --> 01:26:40,070
how many times a guy can bench press?
Two,

1760
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,530
25.
I'm going to guess 50.

1761
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:44,810
Do you think your guy could do it 50 
times?

1762
01:26:46,110 --> 01:26:51,110
Probably.
There's probably some like giant 50 

1763
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:51,110
1:50.
Hold Wow.

1764
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:51,930
Prices.
Right?

1765
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:54,800
Who is it?
Didn't earnest.

1766
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:55,590
Justin.
Earnest.

1767
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:59,260
That mother fucker wonder.
It's probably some field goal kicker.

1768
01:26:59,290 --> 01:27:02,740
Jesus Christ just jacked the tits.
Want to get it.

1769
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:06,450
All I knew is kicked balls and a press 
bench.

1770
01:27:06,510 --> 01:27:10,710
Imagine if they just made field goal 
kickers that are just giant Brock lesnar

1771
01:27:10,711 --> 01:27:13,230
style gorillas to.
That'd be fun.

1772
01:27:13,740 --> 01:27:18,740
Why?
Why couldn't those guys kicked just as 

1773
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:18,740
good or if not further and faster?
Why?

1774
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:20,010
Kickers are always like you're not 
supposed to hit them,

1775
01:27:20,011 --> 01:27:20,760
right?
Yeah.

1776
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:26,320
You can't hit the kicker.
That seems so crazy.

1777
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:28,390
It's a weird job,
man.

1778
01:27:28,391 --> 01:27:31,840
You miss a kick.
All those guys don't care about you.

1779
01:27:32,050 --> 01:27:34,810
They'll stab you in the back.
I mean they just.

1780
01:27:34,830 --> 01:27:39,830
There was no loyalty for the kicker.
The rest of the other guys hold each 

1781
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:40,900
other up.
From what I've read and understand,

1782
01:27:40,901 --> 01:27:43,750
it's like a depressing job.
It's gotTa.

1783
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:44,460
Be You don't.

1784
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:46,700
You don't get.
You're not a part of it.

1785
01:27:46,850 --> 01:27:48,470
Yeah.
You can't get hit it.

1786
01:27:48,471 --> 01:27:50,960
That's the one thing everybody's afraid 
of and you can't get hit

1787
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:57,140
in.
The littlest stuff throws them off to 

1788
01:27:57,140 --> 01:27:59,231
like in this last super bowl,
they painted like the 25 yard line with 

1789
01:27:59,231 --> 01:28:02,010
a special superbowl emblem and it messed
these guys up because it's white,

1790
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:03,990
so they're not used to kicking off 
green.

1791
01:28:04,150 --> 01:28:07,240
Who was the first kicker?
Is the designated kicker.

1792
01:28:07,241 --> 01:28:10,270
Is that always been the rule that you 
can't hit the guy who was the kicker?

1793
01:28:10,950 --> 01:28:15,950
Am I wrong?
Do I know what I'm talking about that 

1794
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:15,950
you can't hit them?
You can definitely hit them.

1795
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:20,390
Oh,
you just can't hit them while they're 

1796
01:28:20,390 --> 01:28:21,330
kicking the ball so you can hit him 
after the kick the ball while they're in

1797
01:28:21,331 --> 01:28:26,331
the process of kicking.
You can't kick their leg unless you're 

1798
01:28:26,331 --> 01:28:26,331
about to block it.
If you hit the ball,

1799
01:28:26,331 --> 01:28:28,170
you can actually then run into them,
but if you don't block the ball then you

1800
01:28:28,171 --> 01:28:33,171
can't touch them.
But if you're reaching for the ball and 

1801
01:28:33,171 --> 01:28:33,270
you've got to remember their legs coming
forward at a crazy fast rate,

1802
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:37,140
if you missed the ball and you hit them,
and by the way the rules crazy.

1803
01:28:37,141 --> 01:28:42,141
And the same goes for the punter,
like if you hit them while their leg is 

1804
01:28:42,141 --> 01:28:43,410
basically still in the air,
huge penalty.

1805
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:45,330
Really huge.
And this is afterwards,

1806
01:28:45,331 --> 01:28:47,310
this guy as a punter,
this is pat McAfee,

1807
01:28:47,311 --> 01:28:49,020
he jacked up the sky on a punt return.

1808
01:28:49,170 --> 01:28:51,990
So like he's not afraid to go hit him.
He'd fucked him up.

1809
01:28:51,991 --> 01:28:56,991
But yeah,
he's probably out for three years after 

1810
01:28:56,991 --> 01:28:56,991
that.
He knows what he did illegal,

1811
01:28:57,050 --> 01:28:57,720
right?
They're not at all.

1812
01:28:57,721 --> 01:28:58,330
Not at all.
No.

1813
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:00,450
He's just now part of the team.
He can go hit them,

1814
01:29:00,451 --> 01:29:02,340
but usually like quarterback,
they want to try to.

1815
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:05,340
He's the only punter on the team.
So you've got to protect that guy.

1816
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:07,350
Otherwise you're fucked.
Without a good kicker.

1817
01:29:07,351 --> 01:29:08,940
You had to go to somebody else.
Wow.

1818
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,820
Interesting.
Jimmy loved the football,

1819
01:29:11,821 --> 01:29:12,340
don't you?
Yeah.

1820
01:29:12,350 --> 01:29:15,120
It's just a weird way.
It's like it's a high level chesting to.

1821
01:29:15,121 --> 01:29:20,121
There's 53 guys,
you have to break it down and then it's 

1822
01:29:20,121 --> 01:29:22,371
all strategy and it's all pre snap 
strategy because it's only five seconds 

1823
01:29:22,371 --> 01:29:26,451
at a time and it's all setting this up.
I'm going to trick you like it's just 

1824
01:29:26,451 --> 01:29:28,200
the guys up in the booth,
old 50 year old men that think they know

1825
01:29:28,201 --> 01:29:31,890
a lot about football and they can't 
actually go do it sorta like an mma,

1826
01:29:31,891 --> 01:29:35,370
like a Duke Roufus type guy.
Call things out.

1827
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:37,790
It's very strategic,
very much chest.

1828
01:29:37,791 --> 01:29:42,791
And that's why bill belichick and Tom 
Brady make it to the superbowl pretty 

1829
01:29:42,791 --> 01:29:43,050
much every year,
which is,

1830
01:29:43,140 --> 01:29:44,730
you know,
just like with the UFC,

1831
01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:47,790
we've seen so many fights like any given
Sunday almost,

1832
01:29:47,791 --> 01:29:48,860
right?
Like if you made,

1833
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:54,080
made the same match 10 times,
we know it's not going to go that way 

1834
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:54,080
every time.
Uh,

1835
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:58,731
but uh,
those guys have a way of figuring it 

1836
01:29:58,731 --> 01:29:59,640
out.
So it's crazy to see

1837
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:05,090
a pro football team,
like all the planning that has to be in 

1838
01:30:05,090 --> 01:30:09,621
place.
All the monitoring of everybody's 

1839
01:30:09,621 --> 01:30:11,451
health,
all the knowing what everyone's capable 

1840
01:30:11,451 --> 01:30:14,061
of.
All the different strength and 

1841
01:30:14,061 --> 01:30:14,550
conditioning routines must watch these 
guys perform and drills.

1842
01:30:14,551 --> 01:30:17,220
You must watch these guys complete and 
then you get together.

1843
01:30:17,221 --> 01:30:20,030
All these people were trying to 
strategize what's the best moves and the

1844
01:30:20,031 --> 01:30:23,070
quarterback's got to figure some shit 
out and call things out in the field.

1845
01:30:23,071 --> 01:30:24,540
It's really a fucking nutty.
Ganesh

1846
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:26,770
can't throw money at it.
They can throw money to fix any of those

1847
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:28,210
problems they want.
Yeah,

1848
01:30:28,310 --> 01:30:33,310
and when you factor in that,
some of the times they're doing things 

1849
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:35,810
just to set you up completely to make 
you think like,

1850
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:36,980
oh,
we saw them do that.

1851
01:30:36,981 --> 01:30:39,080
When we watched video with him play the 
raiders.

1852
01:30:39,081 --> 01:30:44,081
They did this,
so this next play is gonna be this and 

1853
01:30:44,081 --> 01:30:44,081
blah blah,
blah.

1854
01:30:44,081 --> 01:30:44,081
Gone another touchdown.

1855
01:30:44,390 --> 01:30:45,870
Yeah.
That's the thing.

1856
01:30:45,871 --> 01:30:50,871
That's just obviously the issues.
What happens to the players when they 

1857
01:30:50,871 --> 01:30:51,450
get older?
It's harder to watch it now,

1858
01:30:51,451 --> 01:30:53,280
right?
It doesn't seem the same.

1859
01:30:53,450 --> 01:30:55,530
It seemed like the same thing to me 
anymore.

1860
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,300
Now it goes down.
I'm like,

1861
01:30:57,330 --> 01:30:58,980
Ooh,
that sounds fucked up.

1862
01:30:58,981 --> 01:31:00,480
Coming from someone who's seen a lot of 
fights,

1863
01:31:00,481 --> 01:31:05,481
but I just think it's.
It's all.

1864
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:09,450
It's all bad,
it's all bad to get hit that hard,

1865
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:12,570
but in a fight there's a high 
possibility that you could avoid getting

1866
01:31:12,571 --> 01:31:17,571
hit that hard if you're like a mighty 
mouse or if you're like a GSP or you are

1867
01:31:18,050 --> 01:31:20,520
a top of the food chain athlete.
John Jones,

1868
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:24,260
he's going to get hit hard too.
It's still getting around

1869
01:31:24,330 --> 01:31:29,330
the sell those tapes.
I like biggest hits of the NFL speed 

1870
01:31:29,330 --> 01:31:32,080
commercials on TV.
Like it's a little tough to watch those 

1871
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:32,080
now.

1872
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:32,170
Yeah,
don't you think that they're getting hit

1873
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,130
harder?
Yeah.

1874
01:31:33,340 --> 01:31:35,380
They're getting into harder than a UFC 
guys.

1875
01:31:35,381 --> 01:31:35,970
Right?
Well,

1876
01:31:36,230 --> 01:31:39,850
the speed is so fast now that faster 
than they were even five,

1877
01:31:39,851 --> 01:31:41,230
10 years ago.
Yeah.

1878
01:31:41,231 --> 01:31:45,130
I've seen some of those hits and I'm 
trying to imagine the difference between

1879
01:31:45,131 --> 01:31:50,131
that and like a punch or a kick and 
multiple magnitudes of power stronger.

1880
01:31:50,350 --> 01:31:54,160
Like a guy's getting launched through 
the sky with these hits.

1881
01:31:54,370 --> 01:31:56,710
I mean,
well they get launched,

1882
01:31:56,950 --> 01:31:58,670
they lift off the ground,
they go fly,

1883
01:31:58,671 --> 01:32:00,550
and these 200 pound plus men,

1884
01:32:00,690 --> 01:32:04,660
I'm pretty sure footballs worse because 
when it's helmet to helmet,

1885
01:32:05,230 --> 01:32:10,230
I don't think there's any Shin to skull 
kick that could even compare to that 

1886
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:14,461
because the brain is hitting the inside 
of your skull if you're receiving that 

1887
01:32:14,461 --> 01:32:18,271
hit and I don't think there's.
Unless another guy is wearing a helmet 

1888
01:32:18,271 --> 01:32:21,841
running at you at full speed,
especially if you're running the 

1889
01:32:21,841 --> 01:32:22,300
direction that he's in.
Boom.

1890
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:25,210
I mean it just.
That's like two cars hitting head on.

1891
01:32:25,211 --> 01:32:30,211
If you've seen the difference between 
like a car accident in a head on car 

1892
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:33,691
accident,
what happens to the dummy and what 

1893
01:32:33,691 --> 01:32:33,691
happens to people like it's night and 
day first play.

1894
01:32:33,691 --> 01:32:34,900
Here is the very first play of the 
biggest hits.

1895
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:36,780
Oh fuck.
And launch this.

1896
01:32:36,781 --> 01:32:41,370
The Guy Stars Jesus Christ

1897
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:43,860
probably knocked out.
Yeah.

1898
01:32:43,861 --> 01:32:45,780
I would imagine a lot of guys get 
knocked out.

1899
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:47,030
I mean,
you know,

1900
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:52,040
they say that some concussions happen 
from getting hit in the chest that we 

1901
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:52,410
always thought about concussions or you 
got,

1902
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:53,370
oh,
you got hit in the head,

1903
01:32:53,371 --> 01:32:55,650
you got a concussion.
I didn't know until fairly recently.

1904
01:32:55,651 --> 01:33:00,651
That's how stupid I am.
I didn't know that you can get a 

1905
01:33:00,651 --> 01:33:02,040
concussion from getting hit to the body 
because when you get hit in the body,

1906
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:07,160
your brain jostled around just as much.
It's a different scene than the 

1907
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:11,340
hemorrhaging in the brain that you often
get from local trauma.

1908
01:33:12,390 --> 01:33:13,380
That's scary.
Shit.

1909
01:33:13,670 --> 01:33:18,670
People fall and hit their heads,
but just getting kicked to the body 

1910
01:33:18,670 --> 01:33:20,790
fucks your brain up.
That's what's crazy.

1911
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:25,800
It's not just hitting right on the spot,
which definitely does it too,

1912
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:30,660
but guys get their brains rattled from a
kick to the body for sure,

1913
01:33:30,661 --> 01:33:33,600
for a take down for sure for football.

1914
01:33:33,770 --> 01:33:36,020
Everyone's had a bad one in a wrestling 
match.

1915
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:41,050
In high school I got stuck like in a 
embridge and the guy had me in like a 

1916
01:33:41,050 --> 01:33:43,880
head scissors and he snapped it back 
real hard and my head hit the mat.

1917
01:33:44,270 --> 01:33:46,550
I woke up with Puke on me.
I was still,

1918
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:51,290
I was still on my back in the middle of 
the mat and night qct like projectile,

1919
01:33:51,291 --> 01:33:54,890
like pop up cold and cold and puked.
That's dangerous man.

1920
01:33:54,891 --> 01:33:58,160
He could choke on your own.
That's the one time I had to go straight

1921
01:33:58,161 --> 01:34:03,140
to a hospital in the ambulance.
Football

1922
01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:07,200
is probably the most impact because 
you're both running,

1923
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:10,650
so guys running at you full clip.
That never happens in wrestling.

1924
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:12,390
It was never like running at you.

1925
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:15,850
This is the hypnosis.
This Guy Ryan shazier number 50.

1926
01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:20,910
He has a normal tackle,
but he is just now getting the feeling 

1927
01:34:20,910 --> 01:34:22,600
back in his legs.
This happened about six months ago.

1928
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,450
Oh my God.
Yeah.

1929
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:29,770
Oh really?
Freak accident and his spine on a normal

1930
01:34:29,771 --> 01:34:31,330
tackle.
Normal everyday tasks.

1931
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:32,270
Shit.
Yeah.

1932
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:35,320
This happened,
like play,

1933
01:34:35,321 --> 01:34:39,790
like that can happen like that on any,
any given five seconds of an NFL game,

1934
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:42,340
a player like that can have his life 
changed.

1935
01:34:42,430 --> 01:34:47,430
And that's a net.
Another freak athlete from the Ohio 

1936
01:34:47,430 --> 01:34:48,460
State University that's been one of the 
top line backers every year.

1937
01:34:49,010 --> 01:34:51,080
Yeah,
I mean it's um,

1938
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:54,800
it's super unfortunate that the body so 
goddamn brittle,

1939
01:34:55,370 --> 01:35:00,370
but it's also one of the things that 
makes so fascinating when you see what 

1940
01:35:00,370 --> 01:35:00,370
these guys capable of doing.
So,

1941
01:35:00,370 --> 01:35:04,851
you know,
there's a brief window like the 

1942
01:35:04,851 --> 01:35:04,851
Olympics,
which is going on right now.

1943
01:35:04,851 --> 01:35:07,880
This is a brief window where someone can
be good as a Michael Phelps,

1944
01:35:07,940 --> 01:35:08,540
right?
Like,

1945
01:35:08,710 --> 01:35:13,710
how many,
how many years do you have where you 

1946
01:35:13,710 --> 01:35:13,710
could just dominate swimming like that?
They've got 10.

1947
01:35:13,710 --> 01:35:14,780
Is that,
is that real?

1948
01:35:14,781 --> 01:35:16,460
Is that a real number?
Was 15.

1949
01:35:16,490 --> 01:35:17,060
I mean,
what is it?

1950
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:19,190
How long can you can.
You definitely can't keep it up forever.

1951
01:35:19,490 --> 01:35:21,740
It's like when does everything just fall
apart?

1952
01:35:21,770 --> 01:35:26,770
So when you're watching someone who can 
do crazy shit with their body and then 

1953
01:35:26,770 --> 01:35:28,970
you see a tackle like that,
that leads to a guy being paralyzed,

1954
01:35:28,971 --> 01:35:33,971
like,
fuck dude,

1955
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:36,620
that's hard,
you know,

1956
01:35:37,730 --> 01:35:41,120
but you wouldn't want,
would you want it to change

1957
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:43,380
football?
Yeah,

1958
01:35:43,381 --> 01:35:45,660
I think they should have a big balloon 
helmets on.

1959
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:50,520
Big silly looking super soft bouncy 
helmets.

1960
01:35:51,310 --> 01:35:52,300
Would you want it to change?

1961
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:58,080
I've been thinking about that.
I think it's going to change a little 

1962
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:58,080
bit,
but I mean if you were the commissioner.

1963
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:58,080
Yeah,

1964
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,650
said young.
Jamie,

1965
01:35:59,830 --> 01:36:01,450
you seem to know what the fuck you're 
talking about.

1966
01:36:01,451 --> 01:36:04,240
Would you please do us a favor and tell 
us how to run this football thing?

1967
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:05,750
Yeah.
There's things they.

1968
01:36:05,790 --> 01:36:10,790
I think they could do to change it.
There's stronger helmets they could 

1969
01:36:10,790 --> 01:36:12,921
probably be using.
I don't know if that would have helped 

1970
01:36:12,921 --> 01:36:15,141
them.
I could probably have some more 

1971
01:36:15,141 --> 01:36:15,141
protection.

1972
01:36:15,141 --> 01:36:15,141
The technology's probably around the 
corner.

1973
01:36:15,141 --> 01:36:18,010
It's probably like some type of weird 
airbag in a helmet that they're going to

1974
01:36:18,011 --> 01:36:19,780
end up getting or something weird,
you know,

1975
01:36:20,070 --> 01:36:21,690
like maybe a decelerator or something.

1976
01:36:21,730 --> 01:36:26,730
It's like that that absorbs the impact 
of the hit on your head so that it 

1977
01:36:26,730 --> 01:36:30,111
doesn't snap you back though.
The conventional wisdom is that the 

1978
01:36:30,111 --> 01:36:34,170
helmets actually make it worse because 
they can hit each other much harder.

1979
01:36:34,230 --> 01:36:39,230
Whereas like they get more damaged than 
a rugby player gets rugby players 

1980
01:36:39,230 --> 01:36:42,981
because they know there's no padding 
there not doing the same kind of crazy 

1981
01:36:42,981 --> 01:36:45,861
shit.
It requires different techniques if you 

1982
01:36:45,861 --> 01:36:48,561
want to have a career,
and I just mean in rugby's obviously 

1983
01:36:48,561 --> 01:36:50,010
they get down and dirty and it's a very,
very tough game,

1984
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:51,890
but they,
um,

1985
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:54,060
it's a,
you have to do a totally different thing

1986
01:36:54,061 --> 01:36:59,061
when you're not padded up.
It's like if you watch their scrims and 

1987
01:36:59,061 --> 01:37:00,270
you watch some of the crazy physical 
altercations they have,

1988
01:37:00,271 --> 01:37:02,370
it looks more like running and 
wrestling.

1989
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:05,100
There's like a lot of wrestling involved
was a football,

1990
01:37:05,101 --> 01:37:10,101
it's just this like fucking chaos of 
colliding bodies and people fucking 

1991
01:37:10,101 --> 01:37:12,480
smashing into people and jumping over 
people and

1992
01:37:13,170 --> 01:37:18,170
I just feel listened to that NPR episode
about football and how it started and 

1993
01:37:18,170 --> 01:37:21,741
that's how football used to be.
It used to just be two people or two 

1994
01:37:21,741 --> 01:37:24,801
teams would line up and they just run 
into each other and scrum and just 

1995
01:37:24,801 --> 01:37:24,870
slowly move the ball down the field 
slowly,

1996
01:37:24,871 --> 01:37:25,560
slowly,
slowly.

1997
01:37:25,561 --> 01:37:29,040
And then eventually as time went by,
they started adding the past and things.

1998
01:37:29,041 --> 01:37:34,041
And now it's just.
The NFL is literally just passed the 

1999
01:37:34,041 --> 01:37:34,041
ball for as many touchdowns as you can 
get.

2000
01:37:34,050 --> 01:37:39,050
Hopefully nobody gets hurt.
Ian Edwards is trying to turn me into a 

2001
01:37:39,050 --> 01:37:39,050
soccer fan,
but it just didn't take.

2002
01:37:39,050 --> 01:37:39,050
Ha Ha,
ha ha.

2003
01:37:40,650 --> 01:37:45,650
Me and him at a bar.
He showed me like some super important 

2004
01:37:45,650 --> 01:37:48,201
game and I'm just mocking him,
mocking him and making fun of the whole 

2005
01:37:48,201 --> 01:37:48,201
thing.

2006
01:37:48,201 --> 01:37:52,230
I could see you being a pro wrestling 
fan before being a soccer fan for sure.

2007
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:53,660
No,
look,

2008
01:37:54,170 --> 01:37:55,980
I've stated numerous occasions.

2009
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:57,630
I'm a huge ric flair fan.
Yeah,

2010
01:37:57,860 --> 01:37:58,950
no,
I love that.

2011
01:37:59,270 --> 01:38:01,370
If any of their babies,
I'm a huge.

2012
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:04,230
I love the rock.
I think the rock is awesome.

2013
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:08,310
I go to see all his movies.
I want to see Jumanji twice.

2014
01:38:08,410 --> 01:38:09,670
I got star struck.
I.

2015
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:12,970
I met Ric Flair at the airport after the
royal rumble.

2016
01:38:13,030 --> 01:38:18,030
It was so crazy.
Our flight had just gotten delayed on 

2017
01:38:18,030 --> 01:38:19,060
the tarmac and then canceled.
We get deep boarded.

2018
01:38:19,690 --> 01:38:21,760
Everybody else is waiting at the desk.
I'm like,

2019
01:38:21,761 --> 01:38:25,090
I'm going to go to the customer service 
part of this airline.

2020
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:27,550
I know how this crap works.
There's a long line,

2021
01:38:27,551 --> 01:38:32,551
so I'm like,
I'm going to go to the customer service 

2022
01:38:32,551 --> 01:38:34,471
and I'm walking by myself and there he 
is walking straight at me by himself and

2023
01:38:36,731 --> 01:38:39,100
I literally like as a,
as I'm getting closer,

2024
01:38:39,101 --> 01:38:39,940
I'm like,
that's not flair.

2025
01:38:39,970 --> 01:38:44,350
That's not very clear.
That's out of my face comes nature boy.

2026
01:38:44,660 --> 01:38:46,180
And he goes,
yeah man.

2027
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:46,620
I'm like,

2028
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:50,530
hell yeah.
I follow him on instagram.

2029
01:38:51,670 --> 01:38:56,670
I follow him on twitter.
I don't know if I do follow on good 

2030
01:38:56,670 --> 01:38:56,670
instagram.
I follow him on instagram.

2031
01:38:56,670 --> 01:38:58,360
Best Man.
Just a legend.

2032
01:38:58,870 --> 01:38:59,980
Yeah.
You know,

2033
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,730
it's like stuff like that that I enjoy 
about pro wrestling.

2034
01:39:03,790 --> 01:39:06,160
That's what I enjoyed the most 
ridiculous aspects of it.

2035
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:11,190
Yeah.
Like I was a big fan of Jimmy superfly 

2036
01:39:11,190 --> 01:39:13,441
snuck back in the day because it was 
just so ridiculous that he would always 

2037
01:39:13,441 --> 01:39:16,681
wind up on the top rope,
what some guy unconscious underneath 

2038
01:39:16,681 --> 01:39:17,620
them and he would fly through the air 
land dot.

2039
01:39:17,621 --> 01:39:19,060
Um,
and we were always pumped about it.

2040
01:39:19,630 --> 01:39:22,090
So silly.
There's a lot of fun stuff happening.

2041
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:25,210
Yeah,
the man,

2042
01:39:26,350 --> 01:39:28,420
the natch,
the nature.

2043
01:39:31,270 --> 01:39:34,540
I used to be a fan of Bob backlund.
You remember Bob Course.

2044
01:39:34,660 --> 01:39:36,310
I was like,
he's a no nonsense guy,

2045
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:39,700
a no nonsense guy.
That's how I felt about him.

2046
01:39:39,701 --> 01:39:44,701
I felt he was like,
to me like what embodied and actual 

2047
01:39:44,701 --> 01:39:48,121
wrestler versus like the progress 
underneath stuck out like a sore thumb 

2048
01:39:48,121 --> 01:39:49,510
because he did like the progress 
something but not really.

2049
01:39:49,660 --> 01:39:54,660
What he basically did is just engulf you
on the ground and hit you with some 

2050
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:59,101
ridiculous real wrestling.
Then you're not really prepared for is 

2051
01:39:59,101 --> 01:39:59,101
finished.

2052
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:01,630
Move fucking hurts.
Cross face chicken wing.

2053
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:02,850
See?
He was just,

2054
01:40:03,690 --> 01:40:07,380
for whatever reason he did wasn't 
appreciated and it hurts.

2055
01:40:07,381 --> 01:40:09,840
He was two normal people.
Didn't appreciate him enough.

2056
01:40:10,020 --> 01:40:14,040
The figure four hertz in real life too.
They figure four leg lock.

2057
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:16,710
Is that a real thing?
That's a little flare.

2058
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:17,700
Invented it.
Oh,

2059
01:40:17,701 --> 01:40:18,450
I know,
but I'm saying.

2060
01:40:18,451 --> 01:40:19,500
Is it a real submission?

2061
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:21,520
It look,
here's the only catch.

2062
01:40:21,550 --> 01:40:26,550
It's a real submission,
but the person has to basically let you 

2063
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:26,550
put them in there.
I see

2064
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:28,650
it or do they do?
They have to be completely unconscious,

2065
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:32,940
but Bob Backlund,
I had you back buddy back in high school

2066
01:40:33,390 --> 01:40:38,390
when all the other kids were.
They only liked the superfly and then 

2067
01:40:38,390 --> 01:40:38,790
hulk Hogan or it is.
Here it is.

2068
01:40:38,791 --> 01:40:41,340
Let me see.
See you after all the way around.

2069
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:42,300
Okay.
Let me see this.

2070
01:40:42,330 --> 01:40:43,920
See,
this is the part they have to be like,

2071
01:40:44,090 --> 01:40:46,830
what are you doing on?
Let me see this drops.

2072
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:48,570
Oh yeah,
that's totally legit.

2073
01:40:48,650 --> 01:40:49,230
No,
dude,

2074
01:40:49,231 --> 01:40:51,330
if you can get a guy into that position,
that shit will hurt.

2075
01:40:51,950 --> 01:40:53,980
If you get a guy like Gordon Ryan puts 
you in something

2076
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:55,120
like that.
Just for fun.

2077
01:40:55,330 --> 01:40:56,350
Yeah.
Fuck your legs up,

2078
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:59,410
but here's a go back to it again.
I don't think it's a good position for a

2079
01:40:59,411 --> 01:41:02,230
couple reasons,
so like right there.

2080
01:41:02,231 --> 01:41:05,290
It's good if you can get to that.
If you can get to that,

2081
01:41:05,291 --> 01:41:09,130
but I'm not sure.
Here's the catch dop in him.

2082
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:14,800
I'm not sure what's stopping him from 
scooting his butt towards that guy's 

2083
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:17,350
right leg.
Here's the catch is that if you can roll

2084
01:41:17,351 --> 01:41:19,270
over while you're in the figure four leg
lock,

2085
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:22,210
it completely reverses the polars of 
the,

2086
01:41:22,211 --> 01:41:24,640
uh,
of the earth.

2087
01:41:24,730 --> 01:41:29,590
Pain of the pain ric flair with.
Well,

2088
01:41:29,591 --> 01:41:30,610
let me see it again.
By the way,

2089
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:33,430
that's also true in real life.
I've tested that.

2090
01:41:33,610 --> 01:41:38,610
Well,
what I'm saying is like the position 

2091
01:41:38,610 --> 01:41:38,610
it's,
you would,

2092
01:41:38,610 --> 01:41:43,230
there's a natural way to defend it that 
it doesn't seem like the guys defending 

2093
01:41:43,230 --> 01:41:43,230
it.

2094
01:41:43,230 --> 01:41:43,240
That's why like,
look.

2095
01:41:43,790 --> 01:41:45,100
Oh,
he's trying to keep them from putting it

2096
01:41:45,101 --> 01:41:45,520
in there.
Oh,

2097
01:41:45,521 --> 01:41:47,710
he stepped on his dick because he's 
stepping on his deck a little bit.

2098
01:41:47,770 --> 01:41:49,450
That's the undertaker allowed.
You're allowed to.

2099
01:41:49,451 --> 01:41:51,240
Okay.
Now this is a short legs down.

2100
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:52,930
Oh,
that's a heel hook.

2101
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:54,190
Yeah.
The guy.

2102
01:41:54,630 --> 01:41:56,500
Here's the why.
This is so fucking stupid.

2103
01:41:56,680 --> 01:42:01,680
The guy who's getting his leg kranked is
actually the guy who's in the best 

2104
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:02,380
position.
He's in a heel hook position.

2105
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:04,690
Yeah.
If you could just grab his leg.

2106
01:42:04,691 --> 01:42:09,691
Right.
So who's supposed to be getting hurt 

2107
01:42:09,691 --> 01:42:09,691
here?
This is actually the guy in black.

2108
01:42:09,691 --> 01:42:10,330
The guy in black is.
No,

2109
01:42:10,331 --> 01:42:12,190
no,
the guy in the better position,

2110
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:17,500
all he has to do is reach back with his 
right arm and hook time at elbow onto 

2111
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:17,620
the ankle.
No,

2112
01:42:17,621 --> 01:42:18,780
you time out,
motherfucker.

2113
01:42:18,781 --> 01:42:20,440
This is not a figure four leg lock.

2114
01:42:20,470 --> 01:42:22,180
This is embarrassing.
That's a heel hook.

2115
01:42:22,181 --> 01:42:24,760
He's given them a heel hook and the 
other guys pretending he's in pain.

2116
01:42:24,940 --> 01:42:27,190
This is crazy.
This isn't even a figure.

2117
01:42:27,191 --> 01:42:28,930
Four leg lock.
Know what this is?

2118
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:31,060
It's an unmodified.
Oh,

2119
01:42:31,550 --> 01:42:32,830
come on.
Lucky's in agony.

2120
01:42:32,831 --> 01:42:34,350
No,
he's got a fucking heel hook.

2121
01:42:34,450 --> 01:42:36,100
Take the look.
It's right there.

2122
01:42:36,101 --> 01:42:41,101
You go like this.
You clap your hands together and the 

2123
01:42:41,101 --> 01:42:43,261
match is over.
I mean it's 100 percent over in real 

2124
01:42:43,261 --> 01:42:43,261
life.
Yeah.

2125
01:42:43,261 --> 01:42:43,261
Well,
what the fuck are they doing that?

2126
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:46,120
What did they do at winners or losers?
Everybody gets a trophy.

2127
01:42:46,330 --> 01:42:48,710
Is that what you're doing?
You show in a terrible position.

2128
01:42:48,740 --> 01:42:51,550
The guy in white isn't trouble.
What happened?

2129
01:42:52,730 --> 01:42:54,340
What was the difference?
Oh,

2130
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:55,690
I broke up.
Yeah,

2131
01:42:55,770 --> 01:42:57,910
the other guys doing it wrong for the 
whole fucking time.

2132
01:42:58,190 --> 01:43:01,190
This finger for here.
This one maybe.

2133
01:43:01,270 --> 01:43:03,700
Okay.
This is one steps over.

2134
01:43:03,730 --> 01:43:04,360
Yeah.
Boy,

2135
01:43:04,361 --> 01:43:06,250
it takes a lot of work to get someone to
do that.

2136
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:07,360
Wow.
What is that?

2137
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:09,340
I've never seen that.
I'll tell you what that is.

2138
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:11,800
Okay.
That looks painful.

2139
01:43:11,830 --> 01:43:13,390
To go back to that again,
let me say that again.

2140
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:16,840
I think it's the same thing.
I think it's the same thing.

2141
01:43:16,990 --> 01:43:18,640
Go back the same thing.
No,

2142
01:43:18,650 --> 01:43:18,910
no,
no.

2143
01:43:19,030 --> 01:43:21,070
One a little bit further.
Little bit further back.

2144
01:43:21,071 --> 01:43:22,290
I gotta go.
I gotta see the setup.

2145
01:43:22,300 --> 01:43:23,630
I got to see the setup.
Okay.

2146
01:43:23,660 --> 01:43:28,660
Steps over.
The other guy is basically triangling 

2147
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:32,491
his lower leg.
The guy in the bottoms in a better 

2148
01:43:32,491 --> 01:43:32,491
position.
This is nonsense.

2149
01:43:32,491 --> 01:43:33,040
The guy in the bottom fed his leg 
through the center,

2150
01:43:33,041 --> 01:43:34,720
which is the worst thing he could've 
done right there.

2151
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:37,060
He had a triangle on that.
I should have fed it.

2152
01:43:37,510 --> 01:43:42,510
He should have tried to go through the.
He could have fucking swept that guy 

2153
01:43:42,510 --> 01:43:42,510
with that.
Let me say it one more time.

2154
01:43:43,390 --> 01:43:45,820
One more time.
See this guy stepping over and then this

2155
01:43:45,821 --> 01:43:47,860
guy could just triangle that leg right 
there.

2156
01:43:47,861 --> 01:43:49,870
Why is he doing that?
He let him put it in the center.

2157
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:51,710
Even if you let them put it in the 
center,

2158
01:43:52,650 --> 01:43:56,210
he supposed to move as soon as that guy 
spins and then you're free.

2159
01:43:57,110 --> 01:43:59,390
He should have wound up on top there.
Oh,

2160
01:43:59,430 --> 01:44:02,090
see,
this is a true figure is John.

2161
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:04,130
You go,
boom,

2162
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:06,590
boom.
It might hurt.

2163
01:44:07,050 --> 01:44:08,690
Yeah.
It'd probably hurt if a guy,

2164
01:44:08,691 --> 01:44:11,360
a big gorilla like John Cena got you in 
that shit,

2165
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:13,810
but you have to be almost dead.
Yeah,

2166
01:44:14,390 --> 01:44:18,260
exactly.
To be able to do all that shit.

2167
01:44:18,261 --> 01:44:19,520
I mean,
he might be able to do it to me.

2168
01:44:19,521 --> 01:44:20,980
Don't get me wrong.
Exactly.

2169
01:44:21,030 --> 01:44:22,670
If size,
for example,

2170
01:44:22,671 --> 01:44:26,060
if anybody ever hit a figure four leg 
lock in a real fight,

2171
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:29,570
like that would be the most watched 
worldstar video ever.

2172
01:44:29,740 --> 01:44:32,390
I wonder if it's done.
The thing is today,

2173
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:34,100
well Johnson have reversed it.
Oh,

2174
01:44:34,101 --> 01:44:36,020
that's actual real.
That's real as fuck.

2175
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:37,100
That hurts.
Like hell.

2176
01:44:37,310 --> 01:44:42,310
What he's doing is he's fucking that 
guy's knee up and he's cranking on his 

2177
01:44:42,310 --> 01:44:43,190
neck at the same time and and under his 
nose.

2178
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:45,800
The inside of this row.
You can tap now.

2179
01:44:46,130 --> 01:44:47,360
Oh,
you've always been able to tap.

2180
01:44:47,361 --> 01:44:49,550
That's the whole point.
That's how ric flair beats people.

2181
01:44:49,610 --> 01:44:54,610
Well,
he thought that you can count it out 

2182
01:44:54,610 --> 01:44:54,880
when you pin the guy.
That's one way that submission,

2183
01:44:54,900 --> 01:44:56,950
it's a new thing counts.
How long have they been?

2184
01:44:57,690 --> 01:45:02,690
There's disqualification coutts tap outs
and if the ref hits the mat three times 

2185
01:45:04,011 --> 01:45:09,011
with his hand.
How long have they been tapping out 

2186
01:45:09,011 --> 01:45:09,011
forever?
For the beginning.

2187
01:45:09,011 --> 01:45:10,670
Bob Backlund who you mentioned?
Yeah,

2188
01:45:10,690 --> 01:45:15,690
it's cross faced chicken length.
If submission only matches like run for 

2189
01:45:15,690 --> 01:45:19,110
45,
did they have them back in the superfly 

2190
01:45:19,110 --> 01:45:19,110
days with the iron sheik?
Oh yeah.

2191
01:45:19,110 --> 01:45:20,720
Iron Sheik.
Smooth camel clutch submission.

2192
01:45:20,721 --> 01:45:23,900
He made guys tap.
Camel Clutch hurts in real life too.

2193
01:45:23,930 --> 01:45:26,490
I blocked that out of my memory.
Mandible calls one of the best.

2194
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:28,010
That's a weird thing to block out of 
your memory,

2195
01:45:28,530 --> 01:45:30,080
like why did I block out the tap outs?

2196
01:45:30,110 --> 01:45:32,870
Because you have not wanted to be a pro 
wrestling fan.

2197
01:45:32,930 --> 01:45:36,410
You have been in denial of your love.
Look at this.

2198
01:45:36,411 --> 01:45:41,411
This is the mandible cloth from mankind.
Man Puts a sock on his hand and then 

2199
01:45:41,411 --> 01:45:45,550
shoves his two fingers underneath,
underneath your tongue and then squeezes

2200
01:45:46,821 --> 01:45:51,040
his thumb underneath your chin in that 
space and tries to connect.

2201
01:45:51,350 --> 01:45:53,630
What do they call that?
The mandible claw.

2202
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:55,890
But at one point,
uh,

2203
01:45:56,010 --> 01:45:59,540
it was a Mr Soco when he was working 
with a rock and they had the rock.

2204
01:46:00,780 --> 01:46:01,950
You're fucking wrong.
Yeah.

2205
01:46:02,030 --> 01:46:04,310
So he's got a sock puppet on.
He stuffs it in your mouth.

2206
01:46:04,311 --> 01:46:07,040
He keeps,
he keeps the sock in his underwear until

2207
01:46:07,041 --> 01:46:09,670
it's time.
And then when he gets you down,

2208
01:46:10,670 --> 01:46:13,350
the crowd goes crazy and he's pulling 
up.

2209
01:46:13,370 --> 01:46:17,390
Boss pulls the sock out and lifts it up 
and that crowd goes insane.

2210
01:46:17,570 --> 01:46:22,550
That is the dumbest and most awesome 
Diaz at the same time,

2211
01:46:23,030 --> 01:46:25,610
the dumbest and most awesome thing at 
the same time.

2212
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:27,230
Heck yeah.
That kind of shit.

2213
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:28,820
That's funny.
Yeah,

2214
01:46:28,850 --> 01:46:30,290
that's funny.
It's ridiculous.

2215
01:46:30,470 --> 01:46:32,660
But the thing about pro wrestling is 
that a lot of people,

2216
01:46:32,661 --> 01:46:35,150
myself included,
don't want to enjoy it.

2217
01:46:35,690 --> 01:46:38,090
They don't want to let go for something 
like that.

2218
01:46:38,300 --> 01:46:41,180
I think you were,
I think you were like perhaps weeks away

2219
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:43,720
from becoming a pro wrestling fan.
Jude delusion.

2220
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,270
It's been an interesting guy,
Tony,

2221
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:48,170
but I don't trust your judgment on many 
issues.

2222
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:52,540
Oh,
I think you're weeks away now.

2223
01:46:52,770 --> 01:46:57,770
You're going to watch run down.
You're going to watch Rwanda's match 

2224
01:46:57,770 --> 01:47:00,230
though.
You're going to see what happens at 

2225
01:47:00,230 --> 01:47:00,230
Wrestlemania.
I mean,

2226
01:47:00,230 --> 01:47:00,230
he's definitely an orange highlights

2227
01:47:00,990 --> 01:47:05,990
wrong with you.
What was wrong with they rebooted the 

2228
01:47:06,991 --> 01:47:07,720
cosmos,
son.

2229
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:11,250
I'm watching that.
Oh my God.

2230
01:47:12,250 --> 01:47:13,080
So fun.

2231
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:16,700
A pro wrestling is fun,
man.

2232
01:47:16,701 --> 01:47:18,800
I just took everybody.
We went to the royal rumble,

2233
01:47:18,860 --> 01:47:20,940
had a blast,
took a whole crew.

2234
01:47:21,050 --> 01:47:24,740
La comedians out to Philly,
saw Ronda Rousey come out.

2235
01:47:24,741 --> 01:47:27,170
We were all very surprised.
It was exciting.

2236
01:47:27,650 --> 01:47:29,570
Yeah,
it was a big deal.

2237
01:47:29,630 --> 01:47:32,150
Yeah.
You guys get super excited.

2238
01:47:32,180 --> 01:47:32,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

2239
01:47:32,601 --> 01:47:34,150
We went crazy.
I can't get high.

2240
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:39,280
I just all the nuances to follow along.
Who's mad at who?

2241
01:47:40,350 --> 01:47:42,300
Oh,
you would love it if they keep it really

2242
01:47:42,301 --> 01:47:44,220
easy.
They give you just like UFC.

2243
01:47:44,221 --> 01:47:48,120
They give you a little breakdown before 
they have their own Joe Rogan type who's

2244
01:47:48,150 --> 01:47:48,760
like,
you know,

2245
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,740
doing the voiceover.
Here's why this person's like this.

2246
01:47:52,050 --> 01:47:54,480
The technical side of things like they 
do a cool like,

2247
01:47:54,481 --> 01:47:59,481
you know,
a little background and explanation 

2248
01:47:59,481 --> 01:47:59,481
before so you can catch up quick and 
then all of a sudden,

2249
01:47:59,750 --> 01:48:01,260
Bam,
you're watching.

2250
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:06,660
The only thing that seems interesting 
about the possibility of that is that it

2251
01:48:08,250 --> 01:48:12,730
to me is I'm an,
I've overdosed on reality.

2252
01:48:13,180 --> 01:48:18,180
Whether it's pawn shows or you know,
whatever the fuck it is that's on tv,

2253
01:48:18,701 --> 01:48:22,720
swamp people or people making moonshine,
all that stuff.

2254
01:48:22,810 --> 01:48:27,140
I don't,
I don't have any desire to watch anymore

2255
01:48:27,220 --> 01:48:29,660
reality.
Do you know who Brunstrom in is?

2256
01:48:29,740 --> 01:48:30,970
No,
but when I was going to say,

2257
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:35,500
I'd rather watch like a really good 
fiction,

2258
01:48:35,830 --> 01:48:40,830
like something that's good.
Some show something that's written in 

2259
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:42,730
somewhere.
I know it's going to be good.

2260
01:48:43,060 --> 01:48:44,110
Yeah.
All the time.

2261
01:48:44,140 --> 01:48:49,140
Not every now and then the guy tries to 
mouth fuck a dude with a sock on his 

2262
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:49,140
hand.
No.

2263
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:53,780
Funny that it's kind of funny,
but I don't have the kind of time to 

2264
01:48:53,780 --> 01:48:55,951
wait for that to generate.
It's like when I hear about Saturday 

2265
01:48:55,951 --> 01:48:58,471
night live sketches and like,
I'm sure they get one every now and 

2266
01:48:58,471 --> 01:48:58,471
again.
That's fucking amazing.

2267
01:48:58,471 --> 01:49:03,390
But I don't have,
I don't have 90 minutes on Saturday 

2268
01:49:03,390 --> 01:49:03,390
night.

2269
01:49:03,390 --> 01:49:03,390
I agree with you 100 percent on Saturday
night live,

2270
01:49:03,390 --> 01:49:04,880
but they get good ones.
They get good ones.

2271
01:49:04,910 --> 01:49:06,850
Not as good as progress will listen 
that,

2272
01:49:06,980 --> 01:49:09,320
those Alec Baldwin,
once he knocks it out of the park.

2273
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:12,080
Alice,
there's some funny shit still.

2274
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,340
Alec Baldwin has done some stuff with,
uh,

2275
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:18,850
with pro wrestling with Alec.
Baldwin is the most popular show.

2276
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:23,880
30 rock progress sling.
30 rock is pro wrestling now the rock.

2277
01:49:23,921 --> 01:49:25,960
I tried to make a reference there,
but it didn't work

2278
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:28,440
as in 30 rock.
Just like an address.

2279
01:49:28,860 --> 01:49:31,740
You're silly.
You're silly person.

2280
01:49:31,770 --> 01:49:34,500
That's the worst pain you've ever done.
You need to take a break from puns

2281
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:39,900
show you tell everybody that I'm the 
punk king.

2282
01:49:40,190 --> 01:49:42,050
People come see my standup.
They're like,

2283
01:49:42,090 --> 01:49:44,530
I'm really surprised that you didn't do 
any puns after

2284
01:49:44,590 --> 01:49:48,100
you rattled off three or four really 
ones right before

2285
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:50,190
this show started.
I try to hold back.

2286
01:49:50,380 --> 01:49:55,380
I wanted the whole Jane Goodall thing.
You don't think I wanted to say 

2287
01:49:55,380 --> 01:49:55,750
chimpanzee and easy?
I wanted to,

2288
01:49:55,810 --> 01:49:57,640
but I didn't.
Why didn't you say it?

2289
01:49:58,020 --> 01:49:59,970
Because I don't want to be known as the 
Pun guy.

2290
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:00,790
Dude,
you're funny.

2291
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:03,560
You're funny in other ways,
but that's it.

2292
01:50:03,610 --> 01:50:07,750
You are trying to be insecure.
Let your let your talents shine.

2293
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:12,250
You're very funny with puns.
I'm trying to show my full balance.

2294
01:50:12,251 --> 01:50:13,470
You have that too.
In rain.

2295
01:50:13,490 --> 01:50:16,240
Don't hold your puns back when you know 
that they're natural.

2296
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:18,600
That's the thing.
You got them right there.

2297
01:50:18,601 --> 01:50:23,601
They're.
They're popping in your fucking crazy 

2298
01:50:23,601 --> 01:50:23,601
head here,
right?

2299
01:50:23,601 --> 01:50:23,601
Let him free.
You're right.

2300
01:50:23,601 --> 01:50:23,620
Let them free.
Tony Hinchcliffe.

2301
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:26,050
You're right.
That those fuckers free.

2302
01:50:26,051 --> 01:50:27,600
Let them free.
Woo.

2303
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:29,830
Punted it up.
Yeah.

2304
01:50:29,860 --> 01:50:30,790
We're nice people,
so no,

2305
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:35,800
we're not going to repeat what we said 
before the show started where you were 

2306
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:37,420
rattling off all those puns.
I don't remember them.

2307
01:50:38,210 --> 01:50:43,210
That's important.
Is there ever been a time in your life 

2308
01:50:45,100 --> 01:50:50,100
whether it was something that you now 
think is really fucking stupid but you 

2309
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:53,830
believed in then like ghosts or anything
goofy like that?

2310
01:50:53,910 --> 01:50:54,230
Yeah,

2311
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:59,500
I think there's a slight chance that I 
saw something one day at the comedy 

2312
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:01,070
store.
It's silly,

2313
01:51:01,190 --> 01:51:02,660
but yeah,
I don't know what it was.

2314
01:51:02,661 --> 01:51:05,090
Maybe I was borderline about to pass 
out.

2315
01:51:05,091 --> 01:51:07,070
Maybe it was like a low blood sugar 
attack,

2316
01:51:07,071 --> 01:51:12,071
but I saw something weird one day out of
all the days that I worked there for 

2317
01:51:12,071 --> 01:51:16,421
years in the middle of the day.
One day I was working the phones on the 

2318
01:51:16,671 --> 01:51:21,671
second floor in the phone room where 
like the bookers room is now and I was 

2319
01:51:21,741 --> 01:51:26,741
going outside to the belly room to like 
smoke a joint or smoke a cigarette or 

2320
01:51:26,871 --> 01:51:28,700
something like that.
But that's a dark room.

2321
01:51:28,701 --> 01:51:32,000
And I was walking through there and when
I was walking through there,

2322
01:51:32,570 --> 01:51:37,400
um,
I stopped and felt like something.

2323
01:51:37,460 --> 01:51:42,460
It just felt weird,
like something in my gut felt weird and 

2324
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:42,460
then sort of stopped and I looked to my 
right,

2325
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:47,380
right where that other door is.
Like if you're walking into the belly 

2326
01:51:47,380 --> 01:51:50,021
room from the belly room greener and 
there's the green hallway and you 

2327
01:51:50,021 --> 01:51:52,871
finally come across.
So you're right in front of the men's 

2328
01:51:52,871 --> 01:51:52,871
room.
We'll write to your right.

2329
01:51:52,871 --> 01:51:55,190
There's that other door that leads down 
to like the back bar in the back.

2330
01:51:55,191 --> 01:52:00,191
Gullet whole everything.
So those two doorways are right next to 

2331
01:52:00,191 --> 01:52:01,310
each other.
And I stopped there and I saw some weird

2332
01:52:01,311 --> 01:52:06,311
white silver floaty looking thing.
This was like years ago,

2333
01:52:08,130 --> 01:52:13,130
cigarette smoke,
someone was smoking cigarettes over 

2334
01:52:13,130 --> 01:52:13,130
there and they blew.

2335
01:52:13,130 --> 01:52:13,350
No,
it was indoors.

2336
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:15,840
I'm indoors.
Somebody was smoking cigarettes indoors.

2337
01:52:16,230 --> 01:52:18,300
This is back when nobody was at the 
comedy store.

2338
01:52:18,810 --> 01:52:21,360
Smoke cigarettes indoors this time.
Yeah.

2339
01:52:21,420 --> 01:52:26,100
Nobody else smoke.
It was more glowing than smoke,

2340
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:29,730
like it had its own.
Was it spooky smoke?

2341
01:52:30,510 --> 01:52:33,170
It could have been perhaps a reflection 
off of headshot.

2342
01:52:33,550 --> 01:52:36,650
Uh,
but there was nothing on that side.

2343
01:52:36,651 --> 01:52:41,651
It was an empty bathroom.
May I suggest that this was during the 

2344
01:52:41,651 --> 01:52:41,651
day?
Yes.

2345
01:52:41,651 --> 01:52:45,880
And the dust in the comedy store is 
world world class.

2346
01:52:47,060 --> 01:52:52,060
The last time they run a motherfucking 
vacuum cleaner over those stairs is the 

2347
01:52:52,060 --> 01:52:55,100
first time they run a motherfucking 
vacuum cleaner over those days as you're

2348
01:52:55,101 --> 01:52:57,830
walking up there.
I'm just kidding.

2349
01:52:57,831 --> 01:52:58,730
Now they,
they,

2350
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:03,940
it's pretty clean now,
but that's how it used to be for the 

2351
01:53:03,940 --> 01:53:03,940
longest time.
And um,

2352
01:53:03,940 --> 01:53:06,290
you're,
you're going to see when the wind like a

2353
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:08,630
windows open and the sunlight's coming 
through,

2354
01:53:08,631 --> 01:53:12,050
you know,
that glint if there's so much dust there

2355
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:15,680
to like,
you could see it in those little beams.

2356
01:53:15,830 --> 01:53:17,540
Like you could see it floating in the 
air.

2357
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:19,460
He'd be walking by going,
oh great,

2358
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:24,530
I'm breathing in that scary.
But the kicker is old buildings are like

2359
01:53:24,531 --> 01:53:24,880
that,
right?

2360
01:53:24,890 --> 01:53:29,890
Kicker with this one was that I didn't 
tell anybody about it because I was 

2361
01:53:29,890 --> 01:53:31,820
obviously like a whatever.
I mean it freaked me out.

2362
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:36,880
I didn't end up smoking.
I remember I slowly turned around and 

2363
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:37,820
walked back to the phones ring because I
was freaked out.

2364
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:40,160
I'd interrupted you to try to be funny 
and I failed.

2365
01:53:40,250 --> 01:53:42,830
So could you just explain it one more 
time?

2366
01:53:43,190 --> 01:53:44,900
Like you're,
you're walking,

2367
01:53:45,080 --> 01:53:47,090
you see this thing,
what do you see?

2368
01:53:47,091 --> 01:53:49,430
Describe it to me it's sort of like 
human height,

2369
01:53:49,930 --> 01:53:54,380
but like glowy sort of look like,
like I would say like a jelly fish.

2370
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:58,040
It's shaped like a human sort of,
sort of a little bit.

2371
01:53:58,070 --> 01:54:01,130
Like it seemed like it had like casper 
sort of.

2372
01:54:01,131 --> 01:54:03,590
Yes.
As cheesy as that sounds.

2373
01:54:03,591 --> 01:54:05,900
It's sort of did like,
but it was more,

2374
01:54:05,901 --> 01:54:08,990
it wasn't like a solid white.
It was like here's a question.

2375
01:54:09,020 --> 01:54:14,020
This is a good one.
Like why were Goso is depicted as being 

2376
01:54:14,020 --> 01:54:17,180
like wispy was always ghosts were always
wispy and flying through the air.

2377
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:19,670
And the creepy thing is,
is that's what this sort of felt like.

2378
01:54:19,671 --> 01:54:23,300
It felt whispery like on the sides,
like there was sorta like a,

2379
01:54:23,870 --> 01:54:24,920
like a,
I don't know,

2380
01:54:24,980 --> 01:54:28,520
like sorta like how you see that with 
like a fish or something like that where

2381
01:54:28,530 --> 01:54:30,980
I like little tentacles or something 
moving into the air.

2382
01:54:31,250 --> 01:54:34,000
I know this sounds ridiculous,
but that's what I saw it.

2383
01:54:34,050 --> 01:54:36,110
Now look,
it does sound ridiculous,

2384
01:54:36,111 --> 01:54:38,420
but again,
so to people,

2385
01:54:38,870 --> 01:54:43,870
people sound ridiculous.
Like if we weren't a real thing and you 

2386
01:54:43,870 --> 01:54:47,111
had to think about like if there was no 
life form that change the environment 

2387
01:54:47,690 --> 01:54:49,360
around it,
none the war.

2388
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:54,400
The biggest thing would be like a permit
crab or something like that steals a 

2389
01:54:54,411 --> 01:54:55,640
shell and lives inside of it.

2390
01:54:55,970 --> 01:54:58,970
If that was how most of nature was like 
bear den,

2391
01:54:58,980 --> 01:55:00,770
other bear dug a hole in the side of the
hill.

2392
01:55:00,990 --> 01:55:05,990
That was.
It does the extent of people and 

2393
01:55:05,990 --> 01:55:08,140
animals,
birds make nests and then all of a 

2394
01:55:08,140 --> 01:55:08,140
sudden you went to a new place and you 
saw a Manhattan,

2395
01:55:08,810 --> 01:55:13,160
you would.
You would be so fucking freaked out.

2396
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:17,030
You wouldn't be able to believe that 
this one organism is capable of altering

2397
01:55:17,031 --> 01:55:20,600
the environment around it so radically 
and it's the only thing like it.

2398
01:55:20,810 --> 01:55:25,790
The only thing like it by far crazy 
dude.

2399
01:55:26,930 --> 01:55:29,810
What we are is very crazy.
You know,

2400
01:55:29,811 --> 01:55:31,340
I mean,
I think people are awesome.

2401
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:34,370
I enjoy talking to him.
I love what we do.

2402
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:37,740
I love to be able to podcasts and do 
stand up and have fun and,

2403
01:55:38,510 --> 01:55:43,510
but just what we are,
just what the human race is is a weird 

2404
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:46,230
thing,
man.

2405
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:51,120
Weird Little Cot,
multicolored thing that wears clothes.

2406
01:55:51,540 --> 01:55:53,760
Yeah.
Constantly evolving.

2407
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:56,580
Crazy.
We have status.

2408
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:58,680
Some of it dependent upon what's on your
feet.

2409
01:55:59,430 --> 01:55:59,910
Wow.

2410
01:56:01,310 --> 01:56:03,800
It's got some fresh Jordan's.
Is that a thing still?

2411
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:05,210
Did the kids still say fresh?

2412
01:56:07,650 --> 01:56:12,650
Not to be bringing back fresh.
I'm bringing him back fresh.

2413
01:56:13,220 --> 01:56:18,220
We need to bring back fresh.
You can't let fresh go by if someone 

2414
01:56:18,220 --> 01:56:19,460
looks ingos Jamie looking fresh.
I think that's still here.

2415
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:20,050
Thank you.
Yeah.

2416
01:56:20,150 --> 01:56:25,150
Has to be looking fresh.
I've passed many generations of people 

2417
01:56:25,150 --> 01:56:25,730
thinking that things are cool and 
uncool.

2418
01:56:25,731 --> 01:56:29,210
I just missed a lot of shit.
No one really says cool though.

2419
01:56:29,510 --> 01:56:31,040
Oh,
I see that all the time.

2420
01:56:31,070 --> 01:56:32,120
Well there you go.
Well that's cool.

2421
01:56:33,080 --> 01:56:35,430
You look cool man.
Um,

2422
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:37,970
yeah.
Duncan would definitely do it.

2423
01:56:38,630 --> 01:56:40,970
Yeah.
That's cool man.

2424
01:56:41,110 --> 01:56:43,010
Yeah,
that's fucking cool man.

2425
01:56:45,140 --> 01:56:46,760
Yeah,
Duncan definitely still says cool.

2426
01:56:47,170 --> 01:56:48,260
Um,
it's funny though,

2427
01:56:48,261 --> 01:56:50,690
how those words sort of go in a cycle,
right?

2428
01:56:50,990 --> 01:56:54,520
Like if people use them a lot and then 
like certain words you get,

2429
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:59,600
you get,
they get used so much that you're like 

2430
01:56:59,600 --> 01:56:59,600
totes,
you know,

2431
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:00,650
people start saying things like that.
Like what?

2432
01:57:00,910 --> 01:57:03,470
Like where's all this coming from?
Why is everybody saying that?

2433
01:57:03,590 --> 01:57:06,230
There's a bunch of those little weird 
sayings that people start saying,

2434
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:09,410
yeah,
I'm trying to figure out some other ones

2435
01:57:09,620 --> 01:57:11,750
that people started saying pretty 
recently.

2436
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:14,900
God Damn it.
I had one at the tip of my tongue.

2437
01:57:15,890 --> 01:57:19,180
They're really common buzzy things.
Budweiser,

2438
01:57:19,270 --> 01:57:20,480
wazzup.
They always say,

2439
01:57:20,481 --> 01:57:22,700
what's up to everyone?
That was one of the first ones.

2440
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:24,890
So annoying.
That was one of the first ones,

2441
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:31,240
but there's been some other ones that 
people just like little weird patterns 

2442
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:31,250
that people just repeat over and over 
again.

2443
01:57:31,251 --> 01:57:33,680
They hear other people say,
you know,

2444
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:36,650
it's interesting how those sorts of get 
passed around.

2445
01:57:36,651 --> 01:57:37,810
They sound cool.
Someone says,

2446
01:57:37,811 --> 01:57:39,420
I'm it sounds cool,
and everybody starts saying,

2447
01:57:39,880 --> 01:57:41,330
yeah,
there's a bunch of them.

2448
01:57:42,140 --> 01:57:43,280
Totes,
mugshots.

2449
01:57:44,030 --> 01:57:45,350
You know what I say?
And I really mean it.

2450
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:47,180
I say to my friends,
I hope everything's groovy.

2451
01:57:48,240 --> 01:57:51,080
I say that.
Always say that in like text message.

2452
01:57:51,260 --> 01:57:54,110
You know what I say online.
It only only in person,

2453
01:57:54,111 --> 01:57:55,340
but I always say,
what's cooking?

2454
01:57:55,341 --> 01:57:58,520
Good looking.
They found out people love it,

2455
01:57:58,670 --> 01:57:59,540
man.
Love it.

2456
01:57:59,630 --> 01:58:01,490
Women love it.
Everybody loves it.

2457
01:58:01,491 --> 01:58:02,210
Why not?
Right?

2458
01:58:02,270 --> 01:58:03,620
That's a.
that's a compliment.

2459
01:58:03,621 --> 01:58:05,360
Instead of just saying hi.
Hey,

2460
01:58:05,361 --> 01:58:06,500
what's cooking?
Good looking.

2461
01:58:06,650 --> 01:58:06,940
Yeah.

2462
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:09,890
They tell you Tony Hinchcliffe.
So have fun guy.

2463
01:58:09,950 --> 01:58:11,150
Yeah,
right away.

2464
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:11,780
Yep.

2465
01:58:12,890 --> 01:58:16,500
Hey,
good luck in one.

2466
01:58:17,980 --> 01:58:20,480
Imagine that was the only kind of songs 
so you could listen to it.

2467
01:58:21,140 --> 01:58:23,920
That's all they have.
Cooking up

2468
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:27,220
with me,

2469
01:58:27,380 --> 01:58:30,170
man.
Fuck Dude.

2470
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:35,480
Imagined back when they only had a harp.
That's all they had fucking harp and 

2471
01:58:35,480 --> 01:58:37,420
everybody would just sit around going,
oh,

2472
01:58:39,980 --> 01:58:42,190
they're covered in blood and fucking 
sword

2473
01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:45,120
marks all over the body and some 
assholes out there playing a harp.

2474
01:58:45,140 --> 01:58:46,510
You supposed to take it seriously and be
like,

2475
01:58:46,920 --> 01:58:50,710
ah,
fuck that harp.

2476
01:58:51,110 --> 01:58:53,920
I started watching Vikings on season 
one.

2477
01:58:53,950 --> 01:58:56,290
You're watching vikings.
It's a good fucking show.

2478
01:58:57,030 --> 01:58:58,060
Um,
I,

2479
01:58:58,360 --> 01:59:00,400
I liked the first episode.
I was like,

2480
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:02,860
oh,
this is very like TV show ish.

2481
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:05,350
I was prejudice going in,
but it wasn't.

2482
01:59:05,710 --> 01:59:07,910
The first one is a little slow sort of 
setting it up at,

2483
01:59:07,911 --> 01:59:09,240
around,
um,

2484
01:59:09,370 --> 01:59:14,370
because they're setting everything up 
and they have to over a long period of 

2485
01:59:14,370 --> 01:59:14,370
time.
And to get about episode four,

2486
01:59:14,370 --> 01:59:16,420
it starts cracking where you're like,
Whoa,

2487
01:59:16,421 --> 01:59:21,421
this is a good fucking show.
I don't know how much of it is 

2488
01:59:21,421 --> 01:59:22,120
historically accurate,
but it isn't a history channel.

2489
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:26,350
But man,
the vikings were crazy.

2490
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:31,560
They were doing mushrooms and,
and having orgies and the women would 

2491
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:32,830
fight and battle that.

2492
01:59:32,830 --> 01:59:35,860
They were,
they were wild fucking people.

2493
01:59:35,861 --> 01:59:40,861
Man.
I don't know how much of this is like 

2494
01:59:40,861 --> 01:59:42,690
really,
really accurate or what actual 

2495
01:59:42,690 --> 01:59:42,690
historians think about it.
I mean,

2496
01:59:42,690 --> 01:59:45,370
we know that Vikings were incredible 
warriors.

2497
01:59:45,371 --> 01:59:49,510
Big giant fucking dudes and that's like 
what you see still over there.

2498
01:59:49,511 --> 01:59:50,830
And Iceland,
like,

2499
01:59:50,831 --> 01:59:52,540
you know,
they have like some of the strongest men

2500
01:59:52,541 --> 01:59:57,541
competitions.
Like a lot of those dudes come from 

2501
01:59:57,541 --> 01:59:57,541
Iceland,
like Dha.

2502
01:59:57,541 --> 02:00:00,280
Those are the rapers and pillagers just 
throwing barrels.

2503
02:00:00,660 --> 02:00:05,660
Man.
A thousand years ago those guys showed 

2504
02:00:05,660 --> 02:00:07,000
up on shore covered with armor and 
swinging an ax and you are fucked.

2505
02:00:07,210 --> 02:00:08,650
You're fucked.
Everybody's fucked.

2506
02:00:09,060 --> 02:00:11,290
Yeah.
Those guys were crazy.

2507
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:17,550
And again,
I don't know how much of this show is 

2508
02:00:17,550 --> 02:00:17,550
horseshit and how much of it is,
uh,

2509
02:00:17,550 --> 02:00:21,900
you know,
actual historical data and how much is 

2510
02:00:21,900 --> 02:00:21,900
just dramatic interpretations of what 
they thought would be cool.

2511
02:00:21,900 --> 02:00:23,560
It would happen mostly that.
Right?

2512
02:00:23,561 --> 02:00:26,770
There's no way you actually know what 
they said thousand fucking years ago,

2513
02:00:26,790 --> 02:00:30,160
but your stories being passed down.
No pictures of the guy,

2514
02:00:30,490 --> 02:00:31,290
you know,
like yes.

2515
02:00:31,330 --> 02:00:34,120
Things get real weird when you're 
talking about a thousand years ago.

2516
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:36,070
But fuck,
it's interesting.

2517
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:38,330
It makes you wonder like,
how,

2518
02:00:38,410 --> 02:00:41,080
how would I survive in this crazy 
environment?

2519
02:00:41,750 --> 02:00:43,670
Crazy.
Like I get,

2520
02:00:43,750 --> 02:00:46,220
I'm cold all the time.
All the time.

2521
02:00:46,340 --> 02:00:47,450
Yeah,
all the time.

2522
02:00:47,550 --> 02:00:52,550
There's always a part every morning when
I get out of the shower in which I just 

2523
02:00:52,550 --> 02:00:55,841
want to like die right before,
right after shutting off the water 

2524
02:00:55,841 --> 02:00:55,841
before grabbing my towel.

2525
02:00:55,841 --> 02:00:56,870
You had died then?
Yeah.

2526
02:00:57,080 --> 02:00:58,330
You wouldn't be able to make it with the
Viking?

2527
02:00:58,360 --> 02:00:59,380
No,
I wouldn't make it.

2528
02:00:59,650 --> 02:01:02,560
You wouldn't be able to make it.
You've accepted that though.

2529
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:07,800
Totally.
I liked that because you just know 

2530
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:07,800
you're not fighting it.
Like,

2531
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:07,800
this is who I am.

2532
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:09,790
It's been that way my whole life.
I've always hated the cold.

2533
02:01:09,820 --> 02:01:13,180
No doubt it's a big part of the meat.
Picking La over New York.

2534
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:14,470
Do where?
Footie pajamas.

2535
02:01:15,930 --> 02:01:20,930
No,
only because I don't have footie 

2536
02:01:20,930 --> 02:01:20,930
pajamas.
If I had some,

2537
02:01:20,930 --> 02:01:22,870
a fucking bunch of people.
If you should set up one of them.

2538
02:01:23,070 --> 02:01:27,730
Amazon gift accounts that like some gals
have an instagram fame gals,

2539
02:01:28,150 --> 02:01:29,500
you know where people could spoil you.

2540
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:32,310
If anybody wants me some footie pajamas.
I'm five.

2541
02:01:32,311 --> 02:01:37,311
Nine about a buck 45 right now.
Do this.

2542
02:01:37,830 --> 02:01:40,160
You need footie pajamas like bugs bunny

2543
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:42,260
ears.
You need a full bugs bunny outfit?

2544
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:44,390
Yeah,
the Tan rabbit outfit.

2545
02:01:44,780 --> 02:01:46,740
That'll sleeping hat up top.
Yeah,

2546
02:01:46,790 --> 02:01:51,790
or yeah.
Anything else to dangerously furry like 

2547
02:01:51,790 --> 02:01:53,410
you can get away with just ears,
but as soon as you have a Pail,

2548
02:01:53,440 --> 02:01:55,570
you have a tail bro.
You have a tail.

2549
02:01:56,580 --> 02:01:57,890
It's not pajamas anymore,
man.

2550
02:01:57,900 --> 02:02:02,900
It's fucking costume.
Yeah,

2551
02:02:03,161 --> 02:02:05,230
see right there.
That's not a costume,

2552
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:08,350
that's pajamas,
but let me see his ass.

2553
02:02:08,470 --> 02:02:09,370
Oh,
what's his feet?

2554
02:02:09,720 --> 02:02:14,720
His feet.
It's clearly pajamas because you can't 

2555
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:15,220
have a costume where the feet are heads 
to.

2556
02:02:15,250 --> 02:02:17,860
Nobody thinks those feet of your heads.
That's ridiculous.

2557
02:02:17,980 --> 02:02:20,050
So those.
He's got feet.

2558
02:02:20,230 --> 02:02:22,300
The feet are heads.
That doesn't even make sense.

2559
02:02:22,870 --> 02:02:25,970
How's that work?
Imagine you got woke up.

2560
02:02:25,990 --> 02:02:30,990
My big girl.
Then I go walk around on the fuck kind 

2561
02:02:30,990 --> 02:02:30,990
of species.
Are you?

2562
02:02:30,990 --> 02:02:31,480
Look at this.
We have this thing.

2563
02:02:31,480 --> 02:02:34,900
Wow.
So the ears are on top and then what?

2564
02:02:34,901 --> 02:02:37,750
You can't get enough mice.
So you have to have mice downstairs too.

2565
02:02:37,810 --> 02:02:40,060
Is that what this is?
Or a rabbit?

2566
02:02:40,150 --> 02:02:41,990
He can't get enough rabbit.
Rabbit,

2567
02:02:42,190 --> 02:02:43,180
Dad,
sweetie.

2568
02:02:43,181 --> 02:02:47,060
I got you a rabbit costume.
You are rather rabid.

2569
02:02:48,110 --> 02:02:50,800
Woke up my feet.
Rabbits Dad.

2570
02:02:50,980 --> 02:02:53,800
Debbie's feeder rabbit's.
Okay.

2571
02:02:53,820 --> 02:02:58,820
All right.
We'll get you the rabbits and we'll get 

2572
02:02:58,820 --> 02:02:58,820
you the rabbit's feet.
But no tail.

2573
02:02:58,820 --> 02:02:59,110
Did some in demand?
The rabbit's feet.

2574
02:02:59,111 --> 02:03:00,730
This is what I want to know.
Like how did it get to that?

2575
02:03:02,410 --> 02:03:03,430
Did someone say,
well,

2576
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:08,440
we're trying to make actual rabbit feet,
but they look stupid and then someone 

2577
02:03:08,440 --> 02:03:08,440
come along,
go,

2578
02:03:08,440 --> 02:03:08,440
hey,
I've got an idea.

2579
02:03:09,160 --> 02:03:14,160
Take a little stuff right ahead.
You can put it right in your foot and 

2580
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:14,290
then just say,
what are we doing here?

2581
02:03:14,291 --> 02:03:17,740
It's just,
is this a new mythical creature?

2582
02:03:17,741 --> 02:03:21,130
We're creating Scott heads on its feet.
The fuck is that.

2583
02:03:22,360 --> 02:03:24,670
Each feet with its own,
everybody just accepts it.

2584
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:27,520
Just take it home.
Give your kids some fucked up anatomy.

2585
02:03:27,521 --> 02:03:32,350
Lesson heads on my feet.
How come I can't have heads on my feet?

2586
02:03:33,700 --> 02:03:34,530
That's how it starts.

2587
02:03:39,670 --> 02:03:40,670
Yeah.
Heads on the fetus.

2588
02:03:40,720 --> 02:03:44,440
Exactly where it starts.
Do you ever wear anything weird to bed?

2589
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:47,080
You do.
Wow.

2590
02:03:47,081 --> 02:03:48,730
What did I think everybody wants to 
know.

2591
02:03:49,620 --> 02:03:52,710
Farmer never know.
Should allow allowed.

2592
02:03:53,470 --> 02:03:54,250
Oh,
that's cool.

2593
02:03:54,810 --> 02:03:57,220
You got a superman.
It's got a nice one.

2594
02:03:57,250 --> 02:03:59,350
Superman seems to not actually have a 
cape too,

2595
02:03:59,351 --> 02:04:01,350
which is good.
A Batman seems to be a real cape.

2596
02:04:01,710 --> 02:04:02,830
Real Cape.
A Batman.

2597
02:04:04,220 --> 02:04:09,220
Whoa.
So you don't want to sleep with a Cape 

2598
02:04:09,220 --> 02:04:09,220
and choke yourself in the middle of the 
night.

2599
02:04:09,220 --> 02:04:09,220
Die In your sleep.
You know,

2600
02:04:10,190 --> 02:04:11,710
you know,
just doesn't seem right.

2601
02:04:12,730 --> 02:04:16,060
The wonder woman one,
you know what drives me crazy,

2602
02:04:16,061 --> 02:04:20,110
but all this wonder woman shit,
it's men who get upset at wonder woman.

2603
02:04:20,730 --> 02:04:23,800
It's the same thing that drives you 
crazy about this black panther movie,

2604
02:04:24,340 --> 02:04:29,340
which drives me crazy about this black 
panther movie is people getting upset 

2605
02:04:29,340 --> 02:04:31,300
about this Black Panther movie on both 
sides.

2606
02:04:31,390 --> 02:04:34,780
First of all,
white people making a big deal.

2607
02:04:34,781 --> 02:04:36,040
I was like,
oh great.

2608
02:04:36,041 --> 02:04:36,880
Oh,
it's all black.

2609
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:39,090
Like what?
Shouldn't just be all good people like,

2610
02:04:39,960 --> 02:04:44,880
of course this is the way the story was 
and this is the way they want to promote

2611
02:04:44,881 --> 02:04:46,350
it.
Why do you care?

2612
02:04:46,950 --> 02:04:48,150
Like it doesn't,
I don't care.

2613
02:04:48,300 --> 02:04:53,300
But then it goes the other way and I do 
care where I've seen crazy liberal 

2614
02:04:53,300 --> 02:04:58,071
psychos and there were white people in 
fact saying white people stay the fuck 

2615
02:04:58,071 --> 02:05:00,450
out of the theater while,
uh,

2616
02:05:00,510 --> 02:05:05,510
this a while Black Panther is out a 
don't steal their joy with your white 

2617
02:05:06,541 --> 02:05:08,100
privilege.
Oh my God.

2618
02:05:08,101 --> 02:05:10,740
I literally saw something along those 
lines.

2619
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:16,280
I saw a couple of those,
one of them where a woman was asking 

2620
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:19,560
when it was appropriate to see it and 
she didn't.

2621
02:05:19,590 --> 02:05:21,630
She didn't want to ruin it with her 
whiteness.

2622
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:25,440
She was totally serious,
totally serious,

2623
02:05:26,010 --> 02:05:26,670
and those people,

2624
02:05:26,670 --> 02:05:28,380
real people,
and they think that that's.

2625
02:05:28,410 --> 02:05:30,690
That makes sense.
Like God damn it.

2626
02:05:30,770 --> 02:05:35,770
When when shaft was out,
do you think white people couldn't go 

2627
02:05:35,770 --> 02:05:36,420
see shaft when blade came out?
Ninety eight.

2628
02:05:36,421 --> 02:05:38,280
Did White people stay home?
Like what are we doing?

2629
02:05:38,281 --> 02:05:40,980
Are we more divided now than we ever 
were before?

2630
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:44,610
We so silly that you can't.
I want to go see Black Panther because I

2631
02:05:44,611 --> 02:05:47,460
like fucking superhero movies and it 
looks cool.

2632
02:05:48,030 --> 02:05:51,420
The fact that anybody would give a shit 
one way or the other,

2633
02:05:51,421 --> 02:05:54,120
I guess if you're a black kid or a black
guy was like,

2634
02:05:54,121 --> 02:05:59,121
hey,
this gives all of us hope that there's 

2635
02:05:59,121 --> 02:05:59,121
more opportunity for movies to be made 
like that,

2636
02:05:59,121 --> 02:06:03,411
that people aren't really racist and 
they can embrace a black superhero the 

2637
02:06:03,411 --> 02:06:05,760
same way that it can embrace the Hawk or
thought if the movie's really good and I

2638
02:06:05,761 --> 02:06:08,310
hope the movie's really good and I hope 
that's exactly what happens,

2639
02:06:08,700 --> 02:06:13,700
but how the fuck did it changed so much 
from one blade was around because when 

2640
02:06:13,700 --> 02:06:13,700
blade was around,
dude,

2641
02:06:13,700 --> 02:06:16,470
nobody even thought about the fact that 
it was a black superhero movie.

2642
02:06:16,650 --> 02:06:18,090
I mean,
I guess some people did,

2643
02:06:18,210 --> 02:06:23,210
but the emphasis was the fact that 
Wesley Snipes was blade and it looked 

2644
02:06:23,821 --> 02:06:27,480
good and he was doing karate and chop 
and vampires up,

2645
02:06:27,481 --> 02:06:30,120
but swords and shit.
It was a fucking bad ass movie.

2646
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:33,480
That movie was super successful.
They did two sequels,

2647
02:06:34,530 --> 02:06:39,530
so like what's changed?
How the fuck is it changed from then 

2648
02:06:39,530 --> 02:06:42,981
until now with likewise now,
why is it a big deer if there's a black 

2649
02:06:42,981 --> 02:06:46,461
superhero,
but it wasn't a big deal then like are 

2650
02:06:46,461 --> 02:06:48,180
we deteriorating or is it just more 
noise because of social media?

2651
02:06:48,360 --> 02:06:51,750
Do you get a more distorted sense of how
the country actually feels?

2652
02:06:51,960 --> 02:06:56,960
Because the people that are more 
inclined to chime in regularly and 

2653
02:06:57,060 --> 02:07:01,840
vehemently are oftentimes not the ones 
who are calculated and you know,

2654
02:07:01,890 --> 02:07:06,890
assessing thinkers,
they're maybe a little bit more 

2655
02:07:06,890 --> 02:07:07,920
aggressive shooting off the cuff.

2656
02:07:08,070 --> 02:07:13,070
So what you're getting is not an 
accurate representation of how people 

2657
02:07:13,070 --> 02:07:13,070
feel,
but then you start defending it as if it

2658
02:07:13,070 --> 02:07:17,451
is accurate.
And so then people start telling people 

2659
02:07:17,451 --> 02:07:20,200
to stay the fuck home.
Now you've got craziness and you've got 

2660
02:07:20,200 --> 02:07:22,500
craziness because of the fringe,
the fringe on both sides,

2661
02:07:22,740 --> 02:07:25,170
but in the middle.
Most people like hope it's a cool movie.

2662
02:07:25,850 --> 02:07:30,850
Like,
could you imagine if you had a friend 

2663
02:07:30,850 --> 02:07:30,850
and you were gone?
You want to go see,

2664
02:07:30,850 --> 02:07:30,930
uh,
that Black Panther movie?

2665
02:07:31,080 --> 02:07:36,080
Nah Man,
fucking these uppity black dudes are 

2666
02:07:36,080 --> 02:07:36,080
just really getting into this movie too 
much.

2667
02:07:36,080 --> 02:07:37,510
He'd be like,
what you would.

2668
02:07:37,570 --> 02:07:42,570
You would immediately stop hanging out 
with that guy and you'd probably tell 

2669
02:07:42,570 --> 02:07:42,820
all of us,
you know what that fucking guy said,

2670
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:45,700
and we'd be like,
what the call?

2671
02:07:47,260 --> 02:07:49,260
You know?
All that stuff is disgusting.

2672
02:07:49,560 --> 02:07:50,640
All of it's disgusting.

2673
02:07:52,780 --> 02:07:57,780
It's disgusting on both sides.
It's like anytime you're prejudice 

2674
02:07:57,780 --> 02:07:59,890
against white people or even the 
critical about yourself being white,

2675
02:07:59,891 --> 02:08:02,800
that you should stay the fuck away from 
places that is crazy.

2676
02:08:03,370 --> 02:08:06,190
Not talking about intruding on cultural 
rituals.

2677
02:08:06,191 --> 02:08:09,130
We're talking about an awesome movie.
Everybody who can buy a ticket,

2678
02:08:09,131 --> 02:08:11,320
you buy a ticket,
it will make the movie more successful.

2679
02:08:11,620 --> 02:08:16,620
You want giant opening weekends.
If you really love this movie and you 

2680
02:08:16,620 --> 02:08:20,011
want movies like this to be successful,
you should be promoting it for 

2681
02:08:20,011 --> 02:08:20,011
everybody.
White people,

2682
02:08:20,011 --> 02:08:20,890
black people,
Asian people who gives a fuck.

2683
02:08:21,190 --> 02:08:23,380
Go see the superhero movie.
It's going to be fun.

2684
02:08:23,590 --> 02:08:28,590
He's got a pendant.
It turns into a fucking bulletproof 

2685
02:08:28,590 --> 02:08:28,590
outfit and he fucks people up.
You shoot them.

2686
02:08:28,590 --> 02:08:30,100
He gets more powerful.
It's fun.

2687
02:08:30,300 --> 02:08:32,410
Go watch like who gives a shit?
If it's.

2688
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:37,060
I get the people that take pride in it,
they feel like something's happening for

2689
02:08:37,061 --> 02:08:42,061
them that it's a black guy,
but the people that are white that have 

2690
02:08:42,061 --> 02:08:42,061
an issue with it,
oh my God,

2691
02:08:42,061 --> 02:08:42,400
you got to let some shit go.

2692
02:08:42,610 --> 02:08:47,610
You just got to let the noise go by.
Don't let it bounce around inside your 

2693
02:08:47,610 --> 02:08:47,760
head and come up with a year,
but I'm not rushing water.

2694
02:08:47,770 --> 02:08:52,770
Why have good shoved in my face and 
everybody's got to meet in the middle.

2695
02:08:53,230 --> 02:08:55,300
It's a crazy time.
Everybody's got to meet in the middle.

2696
02:08:55,301 --> 02:09:00,301
There's way less tension and conflict 
than is being verbalized.

2697
02:09:01,150 --> 02:09:06,150
That's what I think.
I think if people just realized that a 

2698
02:09:06,150 --> 02:09:09,361
lot of the shit that we're claiming to 
has just some ways we've been thinking 

2699
02:09:09,361 --> 02:09:14,311
and behaving for a long time and then we
can all just fucking communicate with 

2700
02:09:14,311 --> 02:09:14,311
each other just a little bit better.

2701
02:09:15,750 --> 02:09:20,750
I just don't think.
I don't think that racism has gotten 

2702
02:09:20,750 --> 02:09:24,651
worse.
I think it absolutely has gotten worse 

2703
02:09:24,651 --> 02:09:27,291
in some places.
I think there's places where racism 

2704
02:09:27,291 --> 02:09:31,101
exists and I think those.
I think when you have young kids that 

2705
02:09:31,101 --> 02:09:34,161
are raised with racism and family 
members that are raised at racism in a 

2706
02:09:34,161 --> 02:09:35,220
community that embraces racism,
which has existed in the past,

2707
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:40,760
we don't even have to talk about today,
but in the past it was most certainly 

2708
02:09:40,760 --> 02:09:44,300
really racist neighborhood.
The Italian neighborhoods in New York 

2709
02:09:44,300 --> 02:09:47,361
where black people moved in,
they were treated terribly and horrible 

2710
02:09:47,361 --> 02:09:50,421
shit happened in a lot of times.
They weren't even allowed to move in in 

2711
02:09:50,421 --> 02:09:50,421
the first place and there's always been 
stuff like that.

2712
02:09:52,230 --> 02:09:53,910
So if there's always been stuff like 
that,

2713
02:09:53,911 --> 02:09:56,550
it's a natural human inclination that we
have to iron out.

2714
02:09:56,580 --> 02:10:01,580
We can't just eliminate it by making it 
illegal or eliminated by prosecuting 

2715
02:10:01,580 --> 02:10:05,481
people.
We have to figure out why people think 

2716
02:10:05,481 --> 02:10:05,481
like that too.
Scary way to think.

2717
02:10:05,481 --> 02:10:07,860
Scary to think that any one speed.
Look,

2718
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:09,690
first of all,
all of us,

2719
02:10:09,750 --> 02:10:14,750
all of us and almost anyone listening to
this in comparison to someone like Elon 

2720
02:10:16,770 --> 02:10:19,350
Musk is basically a chimp.
Okay,

2721
02:10:19,740 --> 02:10:24,740
so you want to be racist.
You should be racist against this 

2722
02:10:24,740 --> 02:10:24,750
African guy that's smarter than 
everybody.

2723
02:10:25,320 --> 02:10:28,860
Like that's a real African guy from 
South Africa.

2724
02:10:29,100 --> 02:10:30,330
Elan Musk.
Yes.

2725
02:10:30,390 --> 02:10:31,680
Wow.
Yeah.

2726
02:10:33,650 --> 02:10:34,010
He's a

2727
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:35,970
real African American.
Yeah.

2728
02:10:36,020 --> 02:10:41,020
Like legitimately.
But obviously there's different stream 

2729
02:10:41,020 --> 02:10:43,490
black African and I believe it was the 
Dutch that originally settled that area,

2730
02:10:44,420 --> 02:10:45,050
you know,
and that's,

2731
02:10:45,070 --> 02:10:48,380
he's the descendants of those people.
But my point is like,

2732
02:10:48,381 --> 02:10:51,230
we're all dumb asses compared to that 
guy.

2733
02:10:51,231 --> 02:10:53,750
So stop getting all uppity about why 
people,

2734
02:10:53,800 --> 02:10:58,800
you know,
having better GPA and whatever other 

2735
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:01,901
race you're comparing us to because your
stupid compared to that one African 

2736
02:11:02,631 --> 02:11:05,030
dude,
like you're dumb for sure.

2737
02:11:05,180 --> 02:11:10,180
For sure.
Like there's no way you see your vote 

2738
02:11:10,180 --> 02:11:11,060
should count more than his.
Yeah.

2739
02:11:11,330 --> 02:11:11,680
Right.

2740
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:14,220
Mine personally or most anybody's years,
personally,

2741
02:11:15,420 --> 02:11:15,920
I don't know.

2742
02:11:17,750 --> 02:11:19,830
This idea that there's one race is 
better than the other race.

2743
02:11:19,831 --> 02:11:24,831
It's fucking stupid.
The people that are really clinging to 

2744
02:11:24,831 --> 02:11:24,831
it usually don't have shit going on 
other than that.

2745
02:11:24,831 --> 02:11:28,550
That's the problem with racism.
It puts people in a camp of winters when

2746
02:11:28,551 --> 02:11:30,440
they really don't have to do shit to get
into,

2747
02:11:30,980 --> 02:11:32,690
get into the team.
You know,

2748
02:11:32,720 --> 02:11:35,870
the entrance is instantaneous.
You just,

2749
02:11:35,890 --> 02:11:36,470
Oh,
you're white,

2750
02:11:36,471 --> 02:11:37,520
you're in.
You know,

2751
02:11:38,060 --> 02:11:41,420
that's ridiculous.
That's a ridiculous team.

2752
02:11:41,960 --> 02:11:44,150
That's the problem.
That's one of the main problems with,

2753
02:11:44,410 --> 02:11:49,410
with the ridiculous nature of racism,
especially organized racism that you 

2754
02:11:49,410 --> 02:11:52,190
just got to take everybody that looks 
like you.

2755
02:11:52,250 --> 02:11:53,030
That's it.
That's all.

2756
02:11:53,060 --> 02:11:54,410
Not,
not how they think,

2757
02:11:54,411 --> 02:11:56,900
not what they've read,
not their life experiences,

2758
02:11:56,930 --> 02:11:58,730
not how you feel when you're hanging 
around with them.

2759
02:11:58,731 --> 02:11:59,810
Now.
How they make you laugh.

2760
02:12:00,320 --> 02:12:05,320
No.
You want to make sure that they have 

2761
02:12:05,320 --> 02:12:06,410
blood from a certain patch of dirt.
Yeah,

2762
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:09,410
it's crazy.
It's so stupid.

2763
02:12:09,800 --> 02:12:12,380
And they moved the goalpost too because 
I'm a white guy now,

2764
02:12:12,890 --> 02:12:15,920
but when my grandparents came here,
they were dirty guineas.

2765
02:12:16,190 --> 02:12:17,090
Yeah.
You know,

2766
02:12:17,180 --> 02:12:18,220
they were,
um,

2767
02:12:19,220 --> 02:12:21,260
they were thought of the way a lot of 
people think about Mexicans,

2768
02:12:21,860 --> 02:12:25,730
you know,
same kind of thing that's changed now.

2769
02:12:25,731 --> 02:12:27,310
The Italians are full on white.
Yep.

2770
02:12:28,160 --> 02:12:33,160
Totally.
We almost lost our distinction with 

2771
02:12:33,160 --> 02:12:33,160
Jersey shore.
We almost lost it.

2772
02:12:33,160 --> 02:12:36,650
Yeah.
We came real close to losing it close.

2773
02:12:36,740 --> 02:12:38,720
But we're regular white now.
Again.

2774
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:40,490
Feel pretty good about regular white.

2775
02:12:43,310 --> 02:12:47,360
Yeah.
You're whole family is Italian,

2776
02:12:47,361 --> 02:12:47,990
right?
Yep.

2777
02:12:49,540 --> 02:12:51,430
Crazy Italian.
Everybody.

2778
02:12:51,431 --> 02:12:52,800
East Coast at times.
Crazy Times.

2779
02:12:52,801 --> 02:12:54,080
It's almost redundant.
Yeah,

2780
02:12:54,430 --> 02:12:55,240
right.
Yeah.

2781
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:57,040
My East Coast Italians.
Different animal.

2782
02:12:57,160 --> 02:13:00,030
Yeah.
My Dad has an Italian restaurant though,

2783
02:13:00,031 --> 02:13:05,031
so it's a little bit like amped up 
because the family will go there on his 

2784
02:13:05,031 --> 02:13:06,520
side and my mom makes crazy spaghetti 
sauce,

2785
02:13:06,521 --> 02:13:09,520
so that's what everybody wants for every
holiday and everything,

2786
02:13:09,521 --> 02:13:13,120
so everybody's always trying to get like
red sauce in their stomach.

2787
02:13:13,180 --> 02:13:16,230
Yeah.
Whether it's one side or the other.

2788
02:13:16,250 --> 02:13:17,380
The family.
You know,

2789
02:13:17,381 --> 02:13:22,030
what's really interesting is that like 
that sort of style of cooking is not the

2790
02:13:22,031 --> 02:13:27,031
same out here at all.
I literally last night for Valentine's 

2791
02:13:27,031 --> 02:13:27,970
Day,
my wife and I thought out a container of

2792
02:13:27,971 --> 02:13:31,980
my mom's sauce that she sent out in a 
frozen and had that

2793
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:36,980
instead of going to some fancy dinner,
that's what we wanted and it was 

2794
02:13:36,980 --> 02:13:40,790
priceless.
And even then in our every bite you're 

2795
02:13:40,790 --> 02:13:40,790
like,
Holy Shit.

2796
02:13:40,790 --> 02:13:45,150
It's like a New York Bagel or something 
like that to where it's just different,

2797
02:13:45,180 --> 02:13:48,990
like 70 percent better than what you can
find here in la.

2798
02:13:49,140 --> 02:13:54,140
Yeah,
there's difference in the bread for 

2799
02:13:54,140 --> 02:13:56,001
sure.
There's no doubt about it and most 

2800
02:13:56,001 --> 02:13:56,310
people smarter than me attributed to the
water.

2801
02:13:56,940 --> 02:13:58,230
You think that there's something 
different.

2802
02:13:58,231 --> 02:14:00,300
The water in the east coast like New 
York and Boston,

2803
02:14:00,330 --> 02:14:02,370
that when they make bread,
it's just a different flavor to it.

2804
02:14:02,450 --> 02:14:05,780
I also think that there's something to 
the humidity in the air.

2805
02:14:05,790 --> 02:14:10,790
They're actually being there.
I mean we forget we live in a desert 

2806
02:14:10,790 --> 02:14:11,480
because it doesn't feel like a desert,
but it's a desert to bread.

2807
02:14:11,481 --> 02:14:12,110
It's desert.

2808
02:14:12,170 --> 02:14:13,100
That's a good point,
man.

2809
02:14:13,240 --> 02:14:14,480
Yeah,
that's a real good point.

2810
02:14:15,590 --> 02:14:20,590
Pasta taste better.
Their pizza definitely tastes better 

2811
02:14:20,590 --> 02:14:22,280
there and bagels tastes better there.
They have a different thing.

2812
02:14:22,310 --> 02:14:24,050
They feel different when they go in your
mouth full.

2813
02:14:24,100 --> 02:14:25,820
Yeah,
totally.

2814
02:14:26,150 --> 02:14:27,140
Yeah.
They're just better.

2815
02:14:27,890 --> 02:14:30,620
They're trying hard out here.
Some guys are getting really close.

2816
02:14:31,390 --> 02:14:33,520
We really want to go cheat it.
Cheat,

2817
02:14:33,760 --> 02:14:38,760
you know,
get a good solid New York style Bagel 

2818
02:14:38,760 --> 02:14:38,760
out here for like a cheat day.

2819
02:14:40,050 --> 02:14:42,180
Everything's different out here.
They try,

2820
02:14:42,181 --> 02:14:44,520
but it's not ever really the same.

2821
02:14:45,220 --> 02:14:50,220
Yeah.
There's not as nearly as many of those 

2822
02:14:50,220 --> 02:14:50,230
Middle Eastern food trucks like as in 
New York,

2823
02:14:50,231 --> 02:14:55,231
New York.
Those Middle Eastern food trucks are 

2824
02:14:55,231 --> 02:14:55,360
everywhere that have those killer 
kabobs.

2825
02:14:55,510 --> 02:14:57,070
Yeah.
What do they call those things when it's

2826
02:14:57,071 --> 02:15:00,570
a kabob sandwich inside a falafel or 
inside of a,

2827
02:15:00,571 --> 02:15:03,370
um,
like a Tortilla.

2828
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:06,680
What do they call that shit?
I'd say like a pita.

2829
02:15:06,690 --> 02:15:07,810
Just a Pha.
Warmer.

2830
02:15:09,300 --> 02:15:09,910
Warmer,
right?

2831
02:15:09,911 --> 02:15:10,540
Yeah.
That's it.

2832
02:15:10,810 --> 02:15:13,330
And then they had that,
that white sauce that they put on it.

2833
02:15:13,510 --> 02:15:16,060
He only scored all that shit sauce.
Right.

2834
02:15:16,061 --> 02:15:19,900
And then the hot sauce on top of that.
Oh my God.

2835
02:15:19,901 --> 02:15:24,901
If it's like 2:00
in the morning and you've had like one 

2836
02:15:24,901 --> 02:15:25,210
more drink than you should have just one
more year.

2837
02:15:25,211 --> 02:15:26,470
You're right.
And you're like,

2838
02:15:26,471 --> 02:15:27,520
Oh man,
I'm so hungry.

2839
02:15:28,210 --> 02:15:29,150
And you see that.
You're like,

2840
02:15:30,820 --> 02:15:32,620
we have taco trucks here though.
Yes.

2841
02:15:32,621 --> 02:15:33,160
Tons of them.

2842
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:33,870
Yeah,
that's true.

2843
02:15:34,270 --> 02:15:36,370
That's true.
We have way more good Mexican food here.

2844
02:15:36,430 --> 02:15:38,820
Way More,
but obviously do this.

2845
02:15:38,830 --> 02:15:41,440
A joint down the street.
I wish we had more time today.

2846
02:15:41,500 --> 02:15:44,950
I'll take it to like one of the most 
legit Mexican joints in the valley.

2847
02:15:45,490 --> 02:15:50,490
I don't even want to say the name.
I don't want white people to find out 

2848
02:15:50,490 --> 02:15:53,330
that these white ruinous people ruin in 
my authentic Mexican place.

2849
02:15:53,831 --> 02:15:54,390
You go in there,
dude,

2850
02:15:54,420 --> 02:15:57,100
they got authentic Mexican TV shows 
plan.

2851
02:15:57,520 --> 02:16:02,520
Barely anybody understands what the fuck
you're saying when you're ordering 

2852
02:16:02,520 --> 02:16:02,520
things,
so you have to.

2853
02:16:02,520 --> 02:16:03,990
You have to order,
you know those case ideas.

2854
02:16:04,010 --> 02:16:06,340
You gotta you gotTa talk,
you gotta read off the menu.

2855
02:16:06,370 --> 02:16:07,990
Yeah.
A few of those guys understand English,

2856
02:16:07,991 --> 02:16:12,991
but the food is insane.
They have tongue that this whole bucket 

2857
02:16:12,991 --> 02:16:16,300
full of boiling springs language that 
chopping up making Lengua Tacos.

2858
02:16:16,360 --> 02:16:21,360
I love that shit.
White people don't know what they're 

2859
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:21,360
doing with tongues.
What do they do?

2860
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:23,830
They turn it into like some Jewish deli 
food or that's it?

2861
02:16:23,890 --> 02:16:25,870
Yep.
But Mexican food,

2862
02:16:25,871 --> 02:16:26,540
they're like,
that's.

2863
02:16:26,590 --> 02:16:28,780
That's the move through language is 
expensive.

2864
02:16:28,781 --> 02:16:30,040
It's fucking awesome.

2865
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:32,770
It's really good to weird sort of 
texture.

2866
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:34,750
Cow Tongue.
So good.

2867
02:16:34,930 --> 02:16:37,750
That's a legit place though.
And then you go to the.

2868
02:16:37,780 --> 02:16:40,960
They always have a real legit place.
We'll have those little aluminum,

2869
02:16:41,150 --> 02:16:46,150
a chrome looking containers,
and they're filled with Jalapenos and 

2870
02:16:46,150 --> 02:16:48,400
peppers and onions.
Right?

2871
02:16:48,670 --> 02:16:53,670
And you scoop that fucking those debt,
big clump of death out of there.

2872
02:16:54,490 --> 02:16:55,870
Those Jalapenos,
man,

2873
02:16:56,290 --> 02:16:58,420
there's always this creepy carrots for 
some reason.

2874
02:16:58,600 --> 02:17:01,090
Some people like those carrots take you 
off those Jalapenos.

2875
02:17:01,091 --> 02:17:05,350
But those Jalapenos kick your ass.
You use Jalapenos,

2876
02:17:05,620 --> 02:17:10,620
Jalapenos you find and those little 
dishes at Mexican restaurants when you 

2877
02:17:10,620 --> 02:17:11,110
bite into them and you're like,
whoa,

2878
02:17:11,430 --> 02:17:13,690
because all seeds,
fuck taken those seeds out.

2879
02:17:14,530 --> 02:17:19,530
Just thinking that that place had a vibe
where you gotta Kinda know what you're 

2880
02:17:19,530 --> 02:17:21,420
doing when you go in there.
Similar to that place you took me in New

2881
02:17:21,420 --> 02:17:22,200
York.
It's a famous deli,

2882
02:17:22,201 --> 02:17:23,940
but I can't remember the name.
Is that where we went?

2883
02:17:24,010 --> 02:17:25,080
Yeah,
yeah,

2884
02:17:25,140 --> 02:17:26,100
yeah,
yeah.

2885
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:28,800
We got to know what the fuck's going on.
Or you got to know where the fuck you're

2886
02:17:28,801 --> 02:17:31,920
ordering and then where you pick it up.
This is not cut and dry.

2887
02:17:32,010 --> 02:17:34,770
Yeah.
But how legitimate that unique place.

2888
02:17:34,771 --> 02:17:39,771
I just think very unique to the coast 
because like in Ohio we have our own 

2889
02:17:39,771 --> 02:17:40,650
unique restaurants and food and all that
kind of stuff,

2890
02:17:40,651 --> 02:17:45,651
but there aren't places like that where 
it's unique to that place.

2891
02:17:45,871 --> 02:17:48,300
Unique to Ohio,
there are few places like that,

2892
02:17:48,301 --> 02:17:52,110
but it's not a similar style of 
experience and is always packed.

2893
02:17:52,590 --> 02:17:54,760
Always packed because the food's so 
good.

2894
02:17:54,761 --> 02:17:57,720
Don't lose your ticket.
How about that for an and how's that for

2895
02:17:57,721 --> 02:17:59,570
an interesting restaurant?
Yeah,

2896
02:17:59,580 --> 02:18:02,070
it has this weird.
Lose your ticket and try to walk out.

2897
02:18:02,071 --> 02:18:03,150
They charge you.
Yeah.

2898
02:18:03,151 --> 02:18:06,030
This Mexican joint doesn't do like that,
but the way Katz has it.

2899
02:18:06,260 --> 02:18:11,260
Never been.
Katz Deli in New York has been around 

2900
02:18:11,260 --> 02:18:12,500
since.
Who got it?

2901
02:18:12,520 --> 02:18:16,040
It's I want to say more than 100 years 
old I think,

2902
02:18:16,370 --> 02:18:18,290
or somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 
years old,

2903
02:18:18,590 --> 02:18:20,900
but when you go in there,
you get a ticket.

2904
02:18:20,901 --> 02:18:21,560
Eighteen,
88.

2905
02:18:21,620 --> 02:18:22,850
Wow.
Wow.

2906
02:18:23,270 --> 02:18:25,850
Wow.
That's crazy.

2907
02:18:26,250 --> 02:18:29,810
Damn 18,
88 and I bet they ran it.

2908
02:18:29,811 --> 02:18:31,880
Just the way they run it now.
You walk in,

2909
02:18:32,060 --> 02:18:37,060
they give you a a ticket and then you 
walk up to the counters and then this 

2910
02:18:37,060 --> 02:18:41,801
one guy that cuts up meet another guy 
has like pickles and this and they'll 

2911
02:18:41,801 --> 02:18:45,851
give you like samples a slice off a 
piece of brisket for you and you're 

2912
02:18:45,851 --> 02:18:45,851
like,
Holy Shit.

2913
02:18:45,851 --> 02:18:47,810
Slice off a piece of that up.
Astronomy,

2914
02:18:48,590 --> 02:18:49,190
corn,
beef.

2915
02:18:49,191 --> 02:18:54,191
Their corn beef is off the fucking 
charts and you eat it with real American

2916
02:18:54,591 --> 02:18:56,070
steak fries.
Yeah.

2917
02:18:56,380 --> 02:18:58,820
Every bite of it is just better than 
anything else.

2918
02:18:59,050 --> 02:19:00,880
So good.
It's so good.

2919
02:19:00,910 --> 02:19:02,830
It's one of my favorite cheat meals.
Last time I was there,

2920
02:19:02,831 --> 02:19:06,370
I was with there with little Jimmy 
Norton and Russel,

2921
02:19:06,910 --> 02:19:11,910
not Russel.
Jeff Ross came over and sat down with 

2922
02:19:11,910 --> 02:19:11,910
us.
I was there with you.

2923
02:19:11,910 --> 02:19:11,910
Yeah,
I remember.

2924
02:19:11,910 --> 02:19:12,250
That was great.
That was awesome.

2925
02:19:12,290 --> 02:19:15,250
I didn't know where those guys just show
up dude.

2926
02:19:15,251 --> 02:19:16,240
That was so good.
Well,

2927
02:19:16,241 --> 02:19:19,440
Jimmy came to meet us there.
Ross.

2928
02:19:19,450 --> 02:19:22,630
We just randomly ran into.
It's awesome.

2929
02:19:23,050 --> 02:19:26,380
That place is like.
And there's just no,

2930
02:19:27,140 --> 02:19:27,710
there's no

2931
02:19:28,610 --> 02:19:33,610
doubting in my mind at least,
that there's something special about a 

2932
02:19:33,610 --> 02:19:35,000
place that's been used for the same 
thing for a long time.

2933
02:19:35,450 --> 02:19:40,450
You know,
like a place where you go and you feel 

2934
02:19:40,450 --> 02:19:41,210
like this place like Madison Square 
Garden,

2935
02:19:41,211 --> 02:19:43,370
like walking around and Madison Square 
Garden.

2936
02:19:43,371 --> 02:19:45,410
We did the UFC there.
You're walking around,

2937
02:19:45,411 --> 02:19:46,790
you're like,
whoa.

2938
02:19:46,820 --> 02:19:50,690
Like this place feels different.
Like it's got a,

2939
02:19:50,880 --> 02:19:55,370
a resonance to it,
like maybe it's just my mind being aware

2940
02:19:55,550 --> 02:20:00,550
of what an incredible building that is 
and all the incredible stars that are 

2941
02:20:00,550 --> 02:20:01,100
performed there.
But I think it's more than that.

2942
02:20:01,180 --> 02:20:01,400
Yeah.

2943
02:20:01,530 --> 02:20:03,340
Carnegie Deli is gone.
Yeah,

2944
02:20:03,440 --> 02:20:06,990
it closes at the end of 2016.
Oh my God.

2945
02:20:07,290 --> 02:20:09,180
As long as they don't close cantors in 
La,

2946
02:20:09,181 --> 02:20:10,940
I'm good.
I need.

2947
02:20:10,950 --> 02:20:12,660
Can't just stay open.
Really.

2948
02:20:12,720 --> 02:20:16,380
Fuck Ya.
Not a canter's guy.

2949
02:20:16,440 --> 02:20:21,440
You son of a bitch.
This is where he plays the healing 

2950
02:20:21,440 --> 02:20:22,050
wrestling.
He knows cancers is amazing.

2951
02:20:22,150 --> 02:20:24,140
He's like crossing his arms.
So he was a body man.

2952
02:20:24,230 --> 02:20:26,300
Really believe that.
Look at him.

2953
02:20:26,460 --> 02:20:30,780
When do you go to him?
It was being with me.

2954
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Jamie's my real friend by the way.
I live two blocks away from there and 

2955
02:20:36,730 --> 02:20:38,250
you would have met me there and 
complained about the food.

2956
02:20:38,460 --> 02:20:40,500
Well,
I mean if we were going after this guy,

2957
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:43,920
tony is a pro wrestling Greenblatt's is 
great.

2958
02:20:44,040 --> 02:20:45,470
Oh,
how dare

2959
02:20:47,140 --> 02:20:52,140
here though.
I was bummed out that they closed the 

2960
02:20:52,140 --> 02:20:53,170
Jerry's Deli and woodland hills.
Yeah.

2961
02:20:53,320 --> 02:20:54,150
Like,
no.

2962
02:20:54,340 --> 02:20:55,420
You have to go to and see.
No.

2963
02:20:56,440 --> 02:21:01,440
Yeah,
because they closed the one in Beverly 

2964
02:21:01,440 --> 02:21:01,440
Hills.
That's wrong.

2965
02:21:01,440 --> 02:21:01,440
That's wrong.

2966
02:21:01,440 --> 02:21:03,520
I think they have Manhattan beach now 
and Encino.

2967
02:21:03,790 --> 02:21:05,560
Those the only two that are left.
That's too bad.

2968
02:21:06,040 --> 02:21:08,380
Old School.
Real Jewish Delis like that.

2969
02:21:09,040 --> 02:21:11,440
They have the most ridiculous chicken 
soup.

2970
02:21:11,590 --> 02:21:13,450
Have you ever had jerry's deli chicken 
soup?

2971
02:21:14,170 --> 02:21:19,170
Chicken soup that dare chicken soup with
Tabasco sauce and black pepper.

2972
02:21:20,350 --> 02:21:22,990
Get the fuck Outta here.
Mix that shit up.

2973
02:21:23,280 --> 02:21:25,300
Whew.
As it's going down.

2974
02:21:25,301 --> 02:21:30,301
You see chunks of juicy chicken in there
with the noodles and the broth is 

2975
02:21:31,451 --> 02:21:33,580
perfect.
They've been making that bra since Jesus

2976
02:21:33,581 --> 02:21:34,900
was around.
Wow.

2977
02:21:34,960 --> 02:21:38,320
That's a scientific old,
old old recipe.

2978
02:21:38,500 --> 02:21:43,500
The broth there is Jewish food.
They've been making that broth since 

2979
02:21:43,500 --> 02:21:45,250
Jesus was around.
Allegedly.

2980
02:21:45,760 --> 02:21:48,570
I don't know if Jesus is real,
but that brought real as fuck now,

2981
02:21:49,150 --> 02:21:52,550
which came first?
Jesus or the broth to.

2982
02:21:52,580 --> 02:21:57,580
I'm Tom.
I wonder if they probably chicken soup 

2983
02:21:57,580 --> 02:21:57,910
forever when you imagine the breath.
No,

2984
02:21:58,540 --> 02:21:59,500
no.
You sound of a bitch.

2985
02:21:59,770 --> 02:22:00,300
He thought that

2986
02:22:00,750 --> 02:22:05,750
that was going to say that you are 
focused on.

2987
02:22:08,281 --> 02:22:10,410
You were talking about with on rescue 
nine slash 11.

2988
02:22:10,411 --> 02:22:13,050
Did you know that liberty to officer?
Uh,

2989
02:22:13,080 --> 02:22:15,120
toby Malara Turnbull.
Oh,

2990
02:22:15,440 --> 02:22:17,370
the whole thing.
It's on youtube to find it.

2991
02:22:17,610 --> 02:22:19,430
You knew this guy and he was a dick.
Yeah.

2992
02:22:20,010 --> 02:22:22,000
So you think it's bullshit?
Uh,

2993
02:22:22,430 --> 02:22:24,240
let's say allegedly.
Yeah.

2994
02:22:24,360 --> 02:22:25,740
Let's protect legally.

2995
02:22:27,490 --> 02:22:28,260
Yeah.
He,

2996
02:22:28,280 --> 02:22:31,290
uh,
Tony speaking,

2997
02:22:31,291 --> 02:22:34,050
I have no knowledge of this man.
Whether or not he's honorable or not,

2998
02:22:35,180 --> 02:22:36,420
it's not my attention.
See,

2999
02:22:36,421 --> 02:22:37,590
that's the cop.
I wondered.

3000
02:22:37,591 --> 02:22:42,591
A theory is like his buddy laughing 
Adam.

3001
02:22:44,180 --> 02:22:44,570
Wow.

3002
02:22:45,350 --> 02:22:46,760
Yeah,
that's Toby Malara.

3003
02:22:47,090 --> 02:22:48,770
I'll always remember him.
You know what man,

3004
02:22:48,771 --> 02:22:53,771
if people find out that they can get 
attention from saying that you have 

3005
02:22:53,771 --> 02:22:53,771
photos are real,
that they saw them,

3006
02:22:53,771 --> 02:22:56,120
they'll do it.
I know it from firsthand experience.

3007
02:22:56,121 --> 02:22:58,580
I've told this story before,
but I don't know if ever told it to you.

3008
02:22:59,450 --> 02:23:01,850
I was doing a show for CBS called gang 
show in my head.

3009
02:23:02,510 --> 02:23:05,300
And what would they had was they had a 
setup where,

3010
02:23:05,310 --> 02:23:10,310
uh,
I had an earpiece in and the person who 

3011
02:23:10,310 --> 02:23:11,810
was a contestant on the show had an 
earpiece in and we would set them out in

3012
02:23:11,811 --> 02:23:16,811
the middle of somewhere and then start 
asking them questions and telling them 

3013
02:23:16,811 --> 02:23:17,930
what they were they were going to have 
to do.

3014
02:23:18,110 --> 02:23:19,100
We'd say,
are you ready?

3015
02:23:19,160 --> 02:23:20,300
You ready to do this?
Okay,

3016
02:23:20,301 --> 02:23:24,800
here is what you have to do.
I told this guy you are a news caster.

3017
02:23:25,280 --> 02:23:30,280
Now you showed up to do a story about a 
guy who was taken aboard a Ufo,

3018
02:23:30,861 --> 02:23:33,920
a person who's taken aboard a Ufo,
but this person's gone.

3019
02:23:33,921 --> 02:23:37,220
So you have to find a random stranger to
pretend it was them.

3020
02:23:37,460 --> 02:23:42,460
And then tell you a story about getting 
taken aboard the spaceship and getting 

3021
02:23:42,460 --> 02:23:44,300
probed.
And Dude,

3022
02:23:44,301 --> 02:23:47,620
people just get it.
It was the weirdest thing ever here.

3023
02:23:47,870 --> 02:23:52,870
So here it is.
So this is the young man and this young 

3024
02:23:52,870 --> 02:23:55,190
man was a look at me.
So,

3025
02:23:55,540 --> 02:23:58,810
um,
those aliens.

3026
02:23:59,730 --> 02:24:00,160
That's right.

3027
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:07,400
I'd love that to live for you and say 
those things on camera you when you have

3028
02:24:07,851 --> 02:24:10,400
five minutes with $5,000.
Good luck buddy.

3029
02:24:10,880 --> 02:24:14,640
So this dude just walks up to people.
We'll probably get kicked off in two for

3030
02:24:14,641 --> 02:24:17,180
using any of those,
but these dude just talk.

3031
02:24:17,210 --> 02:24:19,220
Comes up and talks to people and he just
explains it to me.

3032
02:24:19,221 --> 02:24:20,900
I'm in a real bad situation.
There's,

3033
02:24:21,380 --> 02:24:25,190
there was a Ufo of visualization or 
whatever the fuck he says,

3034
02:24:25,191 --> 02:24:26,750
and I just need someone to pretend it 
was them.

3035
02:24:27,400 --> 02:24:28,420
Wow.
Dude.

3036
02:24:28,430 --> 02:24:30,080
People do it.
And when they do it,

3037
02:24:30,110 --> 02:24:35,110
they started,
they put their shit down and they start 

3038
02:24:35,110 --> 02:24:36,580
telling a story and not just one guy.
I mean,

3039
02:24:36,581 --> 02:24:37,810
he got several people to do it.

3040
02:24:39,360 --> 02:24:40,740
Wow.
Yeah.

3041
02:24:40,741 --> 02:24:42,390
Listen to the guy while we can't listen 
to it.

3042
02:24:42,391 --> 02:24:43,440
Right.
You're kicked off.

3043
02:24:44,550 --> 02:24:45,960
Can Take it off anyway.
You can go watch it.

3044
02:24:45,961 --> 02:24:49,240
People go a game show in my head.
I go it.

3045
02:24:49,470 --> 02:24:51,110
The dude's name was craig.
Sorry Craig,

3046
02:24:51,111 --> 02:24:53,520
if I can't remember your last name,
but uh,

3047
02:24:53,610 --> 02:24:56,010
he got a bunch of people to talk about 
being abducted by aliens.

3048
02:24:56,880 --> 02:25:01,880
The thing was,
it was so easy to get when people know 

3049
02:25:01,880 --> 02:25:03,720
that they're going to be on camera,
they,

3050
02:25:03,740 --> 02:25:06,660
they get excited.
Like the idea of being on cameras,

3051
02:25:06,661 --> 02:25:11,661
like I'll just fucking make some crazy 
shit up and then all of us sit back or 

3052
02:25:11,661 --> 02:25:15,531
like Jane Goodall's,
like I talked to native Americans and 

3053
02:25:15,531 --> 02:25:18,240
they told me they were probably given 
her why.

3054
02:25:18,520 --> 02:25:20,660
Try and try and get freaky with her.
Yeah.

3055
02:25:20,740 --> 02:25:25,740
Seen bigfoot.
I know where he lives getting high and 

3056
02:25:25,740 --> 02:25:26,740
shit,
you know,

3057
02:25:27,190 --> 02:25:27,550
maybe.

3058
02:25:27,550 --> 02:25:29,290
But for real,
maybe bigfoot exists.

3059
02:25:29,291 --> 02:25:31,570
If you take peyote and go in the woods,
maybe you could see him.

3060
02:25:31,750 --> 02:25:36,750
Maybe you only see glimpse of him.
Maybe bigfoot's a ghost that you only 

3061
02:25:36,750 --> 02:25:36,750
see when you're on pod.
I think,

3062
02:25:36,750 --> 02:25:39,310
uh,
if I'm doing pod in the woods,

3063
02:25:40,600 --> 02:25:43,630
I'm definitely seeing big foot on top of
many other things.

3064
02:25:43,660 --> 02:25:46,030
Let me ask you this.
If you were,

3065
02:25:47,890 --> 02:25:51,490
if you could say with 100 percent 
certainty,

3066
02:25:51,491 --> 02:25:53,620
like what if you had like a thousand 
dollars to gamble?

3067
02:25:54,250 --> 02:25:59,250
Okay.
Do you think you saw a ghost or do you 

3068
02:25:59,250 --> 02:26:02,281
think you just playing tricks on 
yourself and then the more you think 

3069
02:26:02,281 --> 02:26:06,241
about it,
the more you've added stuff to the 

3070
02:26:06,241 --> 02:26:06,241
memory and fuck with that memory in your
head?

3071
02:26:06,241 --> 02:26:07,160
It's actually a little bit scary.
I'm going to be honest with you.

3072
02:26:07,161 --> 02:26:11,080
It's a little bit scarier than I even 
told you because get this.

3073
02:26:11,290 --> 02:26:14,530
That night after I didn't tell anybody 
all day,

3074
02:26:14,890 --> 02:26:18,610
all of a sudden Jeff Scott,
out of all the nights that I've seen him

3075
02:26:18,611 --> 02:26:23,611
there and hung out with them,
they're the house piano player for like 

3076
02:26:23,611 --> 02:26:25,860
25 years out of all the nights without 
telling anybody what I saw earlier.

3077
02:26:25,880 --> 02:26:30,880
Not a soul said that he saw that that 
night and I'm like,

3078
02:26:31,960 --> 02:26:32,650
wait,
what?

3079
02:26:32,800 --> 02:26:33,970
What'd you see?
And he's like,

3080
02:26:33,971 --> 02:26:37,930
it was like white glowing thing like 
that.

3081
02:26:37,931 --> 02:26:40,120
And that's when I went,
Dude,

3082
02:26:40,570 --> 02:26:44,290
I saw that thing earlier today.
Here.

3083
02:26:44,320 --> 02:26:48,070
Oh my God said there's the.
There's the part that I.

3084
02:26:48,220 --> 02:26:50,800
Since you want to make it about a 
thousand bucks bet.

3085
02:26:50,950 --> 02:26:55,950
If I imaginary money,
like that part has to be said out loud 

3086
02:26:57,670 --> 02:27:00,640
because that's crazy.
We were going to.

3087
02:27:01,360 --> 02:27:04,090
I've freaked myself out there before.
Yeah,

3088
02:27:04,120 --> 02:27:06,370
bunch of times.
You know what freaks me out the most?

3089
02:27:06,420 --> 02:27:09,790
The the belly room when the shows are 
off.

3090
02:27:09,970 --> 02:27:11,230
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

3091
02:27:11,260 --> 02:27:12,530
That's where this happened.
It's,

3092
02:27:12,580 --> 02:27:17,580
that's,
that's the spot that freaks me out the 

3093
02:27:17,580 --> 02:27:17,580
most.
And by the way,

3094
02:27:17,580 --> 02:27:17,580
because it's really contained.
Yeah.

3095
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:18,970
What not.
I'm not being honest.

3096
02:27:19,120 --> 02:27:21,190
The main room when it's dark freaks me 
out the most.

3097
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:22,760
The main rooms.
Freaky when it started.

3098
02:27:22,770 --> 02:27:25,340
I don't even like him being in the back 
of the main room when it's dark there

3099
02:27:25,670 --> 02:27:27,590
part of every day.
If you work the phones there,

3100
02:27:27,591 --> 02:27:30,260
you have to walk through that when it's 
pitch black,

3101
02:27:30,261 --> 02:27:35,261
dark to go turn on the lights to turn on
the power breaker for the whole Marquis 

3102
02:27:35,261 --> 02:27:36,440
and everything.
So you have to go out there like five or

3103
02:27:36,441 --> 02:27:38,110
six before it gets dark because the 
mark,

3104
02:27:38,111 --> 02:27:38,620
he has to

3105
02:27:38,630 --> 02:27:43,630
go on.
Before that I had one of them tactical 

3106
02:27:43,630 --> 02:27:43,730
flashlights,
like the Rockwood and many of his action

3107
02:27:43,731 --> 02:27:47,000
films Cook.
You hold it up here.

3108
02:27:47,001 --> 02:27:48,980
Look at that.
Like it's a bramble knife and shit.

3109
02:27:49,070 --> 02:27:49,820
Yeah.
You know,

3110
02:27:49,880 --> 02:27:51,860
looking ahead.
Scary.

3111
02:27:51,870 --> 02:27:53,090
Oh,
Jamie's got one right there.

3112
02:27:53,140 --> 02:27:56,960
Case Shit hits the fan.
Who are you?

3113
02:27:56,990 --> 02:27:58,490
Who goes there?
Yeah,

3114
02:27:59,440 --> 02:27:59,800
yeah.

3115
02:27:59,880 --> 02:28:03,180
Buildings freaky and that belly arms got
something because it is.

3116
02:28:03,181 --> 02:28:07,140
It's contained and you got Mitsis,
unopened,

3117
02:28:07,141 --> 02:28:11,820
sealed off office to the other side of 
that power.

3118
02:28:14,390 --> 02:28:16,340
That's where it's all around Xyz.
Yup.

3119
02:28:17,630 --> 02:28:20,450
Sean's ring.
People don't even know about that.

3120
02:28:20,690 --> 02:28:25,690
That's like.
Think about all the powerful decisions 

3121
02:28:25,690 --> 02:28:26,600
took place in that one office.
Yeah.

3122
02:28:26,750 --> 02:28:31,750
All the different comedy that revolves 
around that one woman running that one 

3123
02:28:32,421 --> 02:28:33,380
club.
Yeah.

3124
02:28:33,640 --> 02:28:34,920
Crazy.
Yeah.

3125
02:28:35,150 --> 02:28:40,150
If you really stop and think about it,
what are the odds of that even being a 

3126
02:28:40,150 --> 02:28:43,151
thing like how does one person who 
really knows how to run a comedy club 

3127
02:28:43,151 --> 02:28:45,350
the way she did,
how they exist when no one else,

3128
02:28:45,470 --> 02:28:50,470
no one does it that way,
and I'm not saying there's anything 

3129
02:28:50,470 --> 02:28:50,470
wrong with the way the other people do 
it and some of those other people I love

3130
02:28:50,470 --> 02:28:52,850
dearly.
Like I love Bob at the ice house dearly.

3131
02:28:52,880 --> 02:28:55,040
He runs a different lot of people run a 
different.

3132
02:28:55,610 --> 02:28:59,330
What I'm saying is that she did 
something that was like,

3133
02:28:59,780 --> 02:29:03,110
that's a crazy way to do it.
Let the inmates run the asylum.

3134
02:29:03,830 --> 02:29:07,610
Like even that one when she.
She made an adjustment to put him in the

3135
02:29:07,611 --> 02:29:10,430
15 year anniversary instead of some 
other guy.

3136
02:29:10,450 --> 02:29:11,000
Yeah.
Yeah,

3137
02:29:11,540 --> 02:29:16,540
and that's what got him the next thing 
that got them the next thing that made 

3138
02:29:17,511 --> 02:29:19,220
him one of the biggest comedy actors 
ever.

3139
02:29:20,200 --> 02:29:20,820
Yeah,
man.

3140
02:29:21,240 --> 02:29:21,560
It's

3141
02:29:21,890 --> 02:29:25,100
obviously everything was prior.
Robin Williams,

3142
02:29:25,101 --> 02:29:26,060
Andy Kaufman,
blah blah,

3143
02:29:26,061 --> 02:29:26,510
blah,
blah.

3144
02:29:26,511 --> 02:29:27,260
It goes on and on.

3145
02:29:27,340 --> 02:29:32,340
It's stunning to think of how much 
comedy comes from the acts of one 

3146
02:29:32,591 --> 02:29:34,420
person.
The actions of one person.

3147
02:29:34,600 --> 02:29:36,610
Look at that ring.
Wow.

3148
02:29:37,400 --> 02:29:39,100
You and arranged or something.
Look at that.

3149
02:29:39,130 --> 02:29:41,230
It's just crazy.
It's a gigantic black.

3150
02:29:41,380 --> 02:29:46,380
What do you think it is?
I don't know how it's black and white 

3151
02:29:46,380 --> 02:29:46,380
picture.
You think it's Ruby?

3152
02:29:46,380 --> 02:29:46,850
Maybe that's something you can never 
wear right here.

3153
02:29:46,900 --> 02:29:50,700
Think that we would get progressive 
enough where you could.

3154
02:29:50,710 --> 02:29:55,710
Where Ruby's kit,
where Ruby rings.

3155
02:29:57,490 --> 02:30:02,490
How many dudes or any,
any rappers like ultra super floss and 

3156
02:30:02,490 --> 02:30:05,471
wearing rubies,
rubies whenever we are going to read.

3157
02:30:07,250 --> 02:30:08,590
So I'm going,
I'm going to be a new wrapper.

3158
02:30:08,980 --> 02:30:11,050
That's my name.
My name is all about rubies,

3159
02:30:11,860 --> 02:30:12,910
rubies,
rubies.

3160
02:30:13,300 --> 02:30:17,620
Them seems like cultural appropriation.
I'll just say all about Ruby's dem,

3161
02:30:17,680 --> 02:30:22,460
dem dem.
Remove this.

3162
02:30:22,480 --> 02:30:25,320
Reminds me of the lipstick challenge 
that.

3163
02:30:25,360 --> 02:30:26,470
Yeah,
the lipstick challenge.

3164
02:30:26,470 --> 02:30:31,470
One of my favorite things were high as 
fuck at the comedy store and we were 

3165
02:30:31,470 --> 02:30:32,170
trying to figure out some sort of a 
challenge.

3166
02:30:32,171 --> 02:30:34,960
And the loser would have to wear 
lipstick on stage for a year.

3167
02:30:36,600 --> 02:30:41,600
Are you going to have to wear it?
You'd have to wear it for the first 15 

3168
02:30:41,600 --> 02:30:42,280
minutes of your set.
After that,

3169
02:30:42,281 --> 02:30:44,130
you could wipe it off just for the fear 
off.

3170
02:30:44,200 --> 02:30:46,780
Yeah.
For the first 15 minutes you're set.

3171
02:30:46,960 --> 02:30:48,650
You'd have to have like a thing about 
wipes,

3172
02:30:48,651 --> 02:30:50,350
like sitting there on your,
uh,

3173
02:30:50,380 --> 02:30:52,060
on your little stool,
on stage C,

3174
02:30:52,070 --> 02:30:57,070
d,
15 minutes of your act with Ruby Red 

3175
02:30:57,070 --> 02:30:57,070
Lips like Miranda sings.
Do you know Miranda sings?

3176
02:30:57,070 --> 02:30:57,220
Yeah.
Yeah.

3177
02:30:57,221 --> 02:30:59,710
Pull up a picture of Miranda sings on 
Youtube.

3178
02:31:00,540 --> 02:31:03,400
She's got a youtube channel and a TV 
show or TV.

3179
02:31:03,401 --> 02:31:07,570
Show his haters back off.
It's hilarious.

3180
02:31:07,630 --> 02:31:12,630
So that's her lips.
You're going to have to do your lips 

3181
02:31:12,630 --> 02:31:12,630
like that.

3182
02:31:12,630 --> 02:31:12,630
Go to a more attractive one right next 
to that one.

3183
02:31:12,710 --> 02:31:14,860
There you go.
Now go back.

3184
02:31:14,890 --> 02:31:17,020
Here you go.
Now go back to that one.

3185
02:31:17,021 --> 02:31:17,650
Perfect.
Yeah,

3186
02:31:17,651 --> 02:31:22,651
that's it.
See what we're going to do just over 

3187
02:31:22,651 --> 02:31:24,360
accentuate the lips.
Clearly go above the actual shape of the

3188
02:31:24,361 --> 02:31:29,361
lip.
One year old man and you should do a 

3189
02:31:29,361 --> 02:31:31,440
special about it.
You should do a special say.

3190
02:31:31,540 --> 02:31:36,540
This is all my lipstick material that 
I'm going to burn off now because my 

3191
02:31:36,540 --> 02:31:39,210
curse has been lifted one year wearing 
lipstick.

3192
02:31:39,211 --> 02:31:43,140
Is he wearing Ruby's rappers wearing 
Gucci Mane Boi.

3193
02:31:43,141 --> 02:31:45,250
Gucci Mane looks so much better now.
It's all finished.

3194
02:31:45,270 --> 02:31:47,550
Shit.
It's kind of interesting.

3195
02:31:48,060 --> 02:31:51,270
Like he's always smiling too.
Like that dude looks happy as fuck.

3196
02:31:51,710 --> 02:31:53,040
Yeah,
he's out of jail.

3197
02:31:53,041 --> 02:31:55,170
But also just looks like he's smiling a 
lot.

3198
02:31:56,100 --> 02:31:57,360
He's like,
it's interesting.

3199
02:31:57,361 --> 02:32:02,361
I think like if I saw Gucci and he's in 
all these pictures and he's just kinda 

3200
02:32:02,361 --> 02:32:04,200
like mean mugging,
I'd have this one thought about him,

3201
02:32:04,470 --> 02:32:07,740
but instead I see Gucci and all these 
pictures now and he's always smiling,

3202
02:32:07,790 --> 02:32:10,780
but I bet that guy's a friendly guy,
you know,

3203
02:32:12,560 --> 02:32:16,650
he looks like he's having a good time 
and he's killing it now.

3204
02:32:16,650 --> 02:32:17,520
Out of jail,
right?

3205
02:32:17,790 --> 02:32:18,770
Isn't he like.
Yeah.

3206
02:32:19,230 --> 02:32:21,730
See even I know he's killing it in the 
rap game back.

3207
02:32:21,740 --> 02:32:24,270
He just released a new album.
Has got to throw you in jail.

3208
02:32:27,060 --> 02:32:29,550
You ever listen to Migos?
No,

3209
02:32:30,320 --> 02:32:32,580
I think you'd like them.
Who's Migos?

3210
02:32:32,700 --> 02:32:37,700
Migos is like a new suit.
It's like a rap group with three guys 

3211
02:32:37,700 --> 02:32:37,890
that,
uh,

3212
02:32:38,180 --> 02:32:42,060
remember the ganging twins.
So they're like the yanging twins,

3213
02:32:42,061 --> 02:32:44,760
but better than like with an extra 
member.

3214
02:32:45,030 --> 02:32:46,890
Wow.
Powerful.

3215
02:32:47,880 --> 02:32:49,350
I think.
I think he would like it.

3216
02:32:49,660 --> 02:32:54,660
Migos rings,
they just got and they're like 

3217
02:32:54,660 --> 02:32:54,870
hilarious.
They're the funniest interviews

3218
02:32:55,390 --> 02:32:57,730
showing those rings again.
Go,

3219
02:32:57,780 --> 02:33:00,310
go big with that.
That picture with the FIS.

3220
02:33:00,880 --> 02:33:04,240
Okay.
Am I looking at it like a half a million

3221
02:33:04,240 --> 02:33:05,340
dollars in diamonds?
Yes.

3222
02:33:05,980 --> 02:33:06,780
That's real.
Yeah.

3223
02:33:07,900 --> 02:33:12,900
That seems crazy to do.
It doesn't seem crazy to be walking 

3224
02:33:12,900 --> 02:33:13,150
around with a half a million dollars in 
diamonds.

3225
02:33:14,670 --> 02:33:15,030
Hey,

3226
02:33:16,220 --> 02:33:20,930
better to be invested in diamonds than a
bitcoin or something like that.

3227
02:33:20,931 --> 02:33:21,200
Right?

3228
02:33:21,860 --> 02:33:24,040
No Dude,
that bitcoin shit.

3229
02:33:24,041 --> 02:33:26,690
My pop the fuck off.
And you'll be sitting here Hayden.

3230
02:33:27,160 --> 02:33:28,600
Yep.
You don't even know.

3231
02:33:29,070 --> 02:33:31,180
Right?
I do know one thing about bitcoin.

3232
02:33:31,480 --> 02:33:36,480
If you say,
I think bitcoin stupid people want fuck 

3233
02:33:36,480 --> 02:33:36,480
you up.
Yeah.

3234
02:33:36,480 --> 02:33:37,730
If you could talk some shit on bitcoin.
They,

3235
02:33:37,810 --> 02:33:39,640
those bitcoin fanatics,
their rabbit.

3236
02:33:39,670 --> 02:33:42,250
It's like a little bit of religion just 
to touch.

3237
02:33:42,550 --> 02:33:43,780
Wow.
Just a sprinkle.

3238
02:33:43,870 --> 02:33:48,870
I think it is right?
It has to sprinkle and not necessarily 

3239
02:33:48,870 --> 02:33:52,081
just bitcoin either,
but there's a bunch of other crypto 

3240
02:33:52,081 --> 02:33:53,560
coins which I fully support.
I have no a dog in the fight.

3241
02:33:53,620 --> 02:33:54,070
Yeah,
me too.

3242
02:33:54,550 --> 02:33:56,430
Yeah.
And um,

3243
02:33:57,420 --> 02:34:02,420
and we keep five of it,
which is all dedicated to justin wren 

3244
02:34:02,420 --> 02:34:05,281
and anytime he wants he can cash out.
This is all a from when Antonopoulos 

3245
02:34:05,281 --> 02:34:09,541
isn't in there.
So I don't really have a stake in it 

3246
02:34:09,541 --> 02:34:11,671
because that's all justin runs money,
but real investment in Bitcoin is very 

3247
02:34:13,721 --> 02:34:18,721
fascinating to me because if more people
were interested in doing and it 

3248
02:34:18,721 --> 02:34:19,770
eventually spread through the entire 
contract,

3249
02:34:19,780 --> 02:34:24,780
everybody's decided to do it and 
everybody figured out how to make it as 

3250
02:34:25,121 --> 02:34:28,240
secure as regular money is,
which is not that secure.

3251
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:31,900
I mean people steal regular money too.
I think figuring out how to make it more

3252
02:34:31,901 --> 02:34:36,070
secure and better than it is now,
which just seems like they would be able

3253
02:34:36,071 --> 02:34:41,071
to.
You never know like who's going to be 

3254
02:34:41,071 --> 02:34:41,440
faster,
the hackers or the programmers.

3255
02:34:42,010 --> 02:34:47,010
It seems like only one.
What was the one coin that someone stole

3256
02:34:47,381 --> 02:34:52,381
a Shitload of recently?
You were just telling me about 17 

3257
02:34:52,381 --> 02:34:55,150
million nano was stolen off of an 
exchange.

3258
02:34:55,470 --> 02:34:57,250
Now what's a nano?
It's a different critic.

3259
02:34:57,460 --> 02:34:58,960
That's another critical coin.
Yeah.

3260
02:34:59,290 --> 02:35:02,530
So what is the biggest one is bitcoin?
Yeah.

3261
02:35:02,590 --> 02:35:04,270
Okay.
What's the second biggest one?

3262
02:35:04,510 --> 02:35:06,910
Off of notoriety?
Probably a theory.

3263
02:35:06,911 --> 02:35:08,500
I'm going to be the second biggest I 
would say.

3264
02:35:08,570 --> 02:35:13,570
Do you think it's possible that one day 
artists will invent their own crypto 

3265
02:35:15,101 --> 02:35:20,101
coins and that's how they buy and trade 
tickets to shows and goods from the 

3266
02:35:21,221 --> 02:35:22,480
people that support them.

3267
02:35:23,690 --> 02:35:27,580
Like think about this golden pony 
dollars,

3268
02:35:28,390 --> 02:35:30,850
golden pony dogs is how people pay for 
your shows.

3269
02:35:30,910 --> 02:35:34,450
You set up like a bank of Golden Polo 
Pony Dot Crypto Bank.

3270
02:35:34,451 --> 02:35:39,451
I don't know how you do it.
You do some blockchain voodoo magic 

3271
02:35:39,451 --> 02:35:39,760
programmer type shit figured out how to 
do that.

3272
02:35:39,820 --> 02:35:44,820
Then once you set that up,
people by that Golden Pony money in 

3273
02:35:45,371 --> 02:35:49,060
order to be able to pay you golden pony 
money for things,

3274
02:35:49,210 --> 02:35:54,210
but you only accept golden pony money 
and only you can only spend golden pony 

3275
02:35:54,210 --> 02:35:59,101
money.
So the only people that accept your 

3276
02:35:59,101 --> 02:36:01,380
money,
the people that accept you if you want 

3277
02:36:01,380 --> 02:36:01,380
to buy a washing machine,
so I'd like to buy it.

3278
02:36:01,380 --> 02:36:01,780
Wasn't Golden Tony Dollars.
They're like,

3279
02:36:01,850 --> 02:36:03,070
no,
no,

3280
02:36:03,090 --> 02:36:06,160
like you have to like you.
They'd go,

3281
02:36:06,161 --> 02:36:06,610
yeah,
Tony,

3282
02:36:06,611 --> 02:36:08,020
you're a good guy.
You're funny.

3283
02:36:08,170 --> 02:36:11,800
I Really Love Yon Killed Tony and you 
stand up special on Netflix was a hoot.

3284
02:36:12,280 --> 02:36:15,250
Sure,
we'll let you pay it golden pony dollars

3285
02:36:15,610 --> 02:36:19,060
and then you could buy a washing machine
with golden pony dollars and that golden

3286
02:36:19,061 --> 02:36:23,830
pony dollars will be traded exclusively 
through golden pony fans and so like you

3287
02:36:23,831 --> 02:36:27,010
really are reliant upon your fans in a 
way different way,

3288
02:36:27,400 --> 02:36:30,730
like you're only getting paid by your 
fans and when they want out they're like

3289
02:36:30,731 --> 02:36:34,000
fuck this golden pony money.
I want to give me some of that.

3290
02:36:34,001 --> 02:36:37,330
Sinbad dollars go on some sinbad 
shekels,

3291
02:36:38,260 --> 02:36:40,210
but they still would have to cash out 
with me,

3292
02:36:40,211 --> 02:36:41,380
right?
No,

3293
02:36:41,740 --> 02:36:42,940
no.
They don't have to cash out with you the

3294
02:36:42,941 --> 02:36:44,380
cash out with somebody else's in the 
group,

3295
02:36:44,680 --> 02:36:49,680
like a certain amount of money to stays 
in the group just like they do with 

3296
02:36:49,680 --> 02:36:50,320
bitcoin.
Like there's a certain amount of bitcoin

3297
02:36:50,321 --> 02:36:53,440
that exists and the price of bitcoin 
will go up and down,

3298
02:36:53,441 --> 02:36:54,760
but the number will not change.

3299
02:36:55,390 --> 02:37:00,390
And so that's their remedy against the 
modern system that we have with 

3300
02:37:00,390 --> 02:37:01,630
inflation and printing new money and all
that shit.

3301
02:37:01,780 --> 02:37:03,300
So there's only a certain amount of 
bitcoin.

3302
02:37:03,310 --> 02:37:04,840
I don't.
If I'm butchering this,

3303
02:37:04,841 --> 02:37:06,550
I apologize.
I'm not smart.

3304
02:37:07,330 --> 02:37:12,330
I have a little variations we appreciate
and so if you did that with golden pony 

3305
02:37:13,241 --> 02:37:18,241
dollars,
you would set up like a golden pony 

3306
02:37:18,241 --> 02:37:18,241
fund.
Like this is,

3307
02:37:18,241 --> 02:37:18,241
this is the bit coin that I,
you know,

3308
02:37:18,290 --> 02:37:23,290
this is,
I've calculated this out with a current 

3309
02:37:23,290 --> 02:37:27,551
bitcoin prices.
If I charge you guys 20 bucks for this 

3310
02:37:27,551 --> 02:37:27,650
thing,
whatever the fuck it is,

3311
02:37:27,651 --> 02:37:29,540
then whatever you call the number,
the name,

3312
02:37:29,680 --> 02:37:34,680
um,
what you'll be able to do is you'll be 

3313
02:37:34,680 --> 02:37:37,541
able to pay for my shows only using that
dissolve I'm going to accept now.

3314
02:37:38,300 --> 02:37:41,330
And then I want to be able to use that 
to buy things from your store.

3315
02:37:42,710 --> 02:37:47,710
Sounds confusing.
I'm going to let people keep using 

3316
02:37:47,710 --> 02:37:47,710
normal money.
It's very confusing.

3317
02:37:47,710 --> 02:37:49,460
It's very confusing.
But the idea would be like,

3318
02:37:49,461 --> 02:37:51,590
say like,
you have some golden pony dollars.

3319
02:37:51,591 --> 02:37:54,110
You got some George Lopez dollars,
you know,

3320
02:37:54,111 --> 02:37:59,111
like you could,
there could be a bunch of people with 

3321
02:37:59,111 --> 02:38:01,961
their own exchanges and it could be 
worth something to you worth more or 

3322
02:38:01,961 --> 02:38:03,650
less depending on how my other killing 
it right now.

3323
02:38:04,730 --> 02:38:07,130
It's very confusing.
It's super confusing.

3324
02:38:07,850 --> 02:38:12,850
What I'm saying is it's entirely 
possible that someone like snoop Dogg 

3325
02:38:13,310 --> 02:38:15,080
who's going to come up with his own 
bitcoin,

3326
02:38:15,540 --> 02:38:20,540
I could see would have to be someone 
super baller that everybody would want 

3327
02:38:20,540 --> 02:38:20,540
their,
their coin,

3328
02:38:20,540 --> 02:38:25,360
you know,
would have to be someone like Kendrick 

3329
02:38:25,360 --> 02:38:25,360
Lamar dollars.
Yeah.

3330
02:38:25,360 --> 02:38:27,800
Yeah.
See if Kendrick Lamar puts out a bitcoin

3331
02:38:27,950 --> 02:38:30,320
or cryptocurrency and he says,
hey fans,

3332
02:38:30,560 --> 02:38:34,490
this is the only way you could buy 
tickets to my shows when I buy shit.

3333
02:38:34,490 --> 02:38:37,250
I want to buy shit only with this stuff,
but it's real money.

3334
02:38:37,430 --> 02:38:42,430
So if I want to buy a Ferrari with 
Kendrick Lamar money better sell it to 

3335
02:38:42,430 --> 02:38:42,430
me,
bitch,

3336
02:38:42,430 --> 02:38:47,141
because that's Kendrick Lamar.
Money is worth gold to all the Kendrick 

3337
02:38:47,141 --> 02:38:50,380
Lamar fans.
It would have to be somewhat of like a 

3338
02:38:50,380 --> 02:38:52,841
super,
super high profile to do something like 

3339
02:38:52,841 --> 02:38:52,841
that.
Some interesting stuff.

3340
02:38:52,841 --> 02:38:53,540
It's not really.
You look at your falling asleep.

3341
02:38:54,050 --> 02:38:55,370
He's barely staying awake.
For me,

3342
02:38:55,520 --> 02:38:59,610
this is sort of sort of describing one 
cryptocurrency.

3343
02:38:59,630 --> 02:39:04,630
This is called steam or steemit,
which is the website that you can look 

3344
02:39:04,630 --> 02:39:05,840
at sort of brand.
None of us the way like dig.com.

3345
02:39:05,841 --> 02:39:09,260
Look very similar to this,
it's like how that started and so here,

3346
02:39:09,261 --> 02:39:11,010
what would happen,
how you,

3347
02:39:11,011 --> 02:39:16,011
you would have to exchange some money or
another cryptocurrency to get some 

3348
02:39:16,011 --> 02:39:16,011
actual esteem,
but here is the,

3349
02:39:16,011 --> 02:39:20,861
for instance,
have you have a person put up a really 

3350
02:39:20,861 --> 02:39:21,980
good article or a piece of content if 
you will,

3351
02:39:22,400 --> 02:39:27,400
um,
you upvote it and then that person gets 

3352
02:39:27,400 --> 02:39:30,070
a coin,
are money from you essentially gets 

3353
02:39:30,070 --> 02:39:30,070
esteem coin.

3354
02:39:30,070 --> 02:39:33,470
You upvoted with a coin and that's a 
very early or primitive way I guess 

3355
02:39:34,371 --> 02:39:37,100
describing what you would do.
So like a PR person creates content,

3356
02:39:37,101 --> 02:39:42,101
puts it online,
and then the viewers than exchange a 

3357
02:39:42,101 --> 02:39:44,060
currency for currency only exists in 
this,

3358
02:39:44,210 --> 02:39:46,130
in this platform,
but yet had then you can exchange.

3359
02:39:46,160 --> 02:39:49,460
Then if another exchange anywhere in the
world wants to start up and say like,

3360
02:39:49,560 --> 02:39:54,560
I deem your currency valuable,
you can exchange it for my currency or 

3361
02:39:54,560 --> 02:39:58,790
in another currency.
And that's where that value comes to 

3362
02:39:58,790 --> 02:39:58,790
see.
Now that makes sense.

3363
02:39:58,790 --> 02:40:03,101
And also,
especially if people are paying for 

3364
02:40:03,101 --> 02:40:05,051
stuff,
like if you're writing things or making 

3365
02:40:05,051 --> 02:40:05,051
videos or something like that and then 
people are paying for that,

3366
02:40:05,051 --> 02:40:06,110
that's a fucking,
you know,

3367
02:40:06,111 --> 02:40:11,111
we're,
we're trapped in this idea of this 

3368
02:40:11,111 --> 02:40:13,600
system that we have now as far as like 
producers of television shows and movies

3369
02:40:13,741 --> 02:40:18,741
and things like that that this is like 
how you get a job in show business that 

3370
02:40:18,741 --> 02:40:22,221
seems like how you get a job at show 
business if you can make videos and 

3371
02:40:22,221 --> 02:40:23,900
people will give you money for those 
videos.

3372
02:40:23,960 --> 02:40:26,180
Kind of what youtube is and lot of 
people have made money off youtube.

3373
02:40:26,710 --> 02:40:29,490
We're dealing in dollars and in the old 
system,

3374
02:40:29,491 --> 02:40:34,491
but this seems like more next level 
could be the new system might take over 

3375
02:40:34,491 --> 02:40:34,491
yet.
Paul.

3376
02:40:34,491 --> 02:40:35,550
Fascinating too because it could be a 
blog,

3377
02:40:35,750 --> 02:40:37,410
right?
It could be a video.

3378
02:40:37,470 --> 02:40:39,060
What else could it be?
This could be anything.

3379
02:40:39,061 --> 02:40:41,820
This is literally just linked so they 
haven't.

3380
02:40:41,900 --> 02:40:46,900
I don't think this platform is opened up
to having like its own video hosting or 

3381
02:40:46,900 --> 02:40:48,190
music being hosted,
but that would be amazing if you could.

3382
02:40:48,191 --> 02:40:48,430
Right?

3383
02:40:48,640 --> 02:40:53,640
Like cool ass articles and people could 
pay you base on the article that might 

3384
02:40:53,640 --> 02:40:54,500
bring articles back,
man.

3385
02:40:55,370 --> 02:41:00,370
I mean not that articles are gone away,
but there's a weird thing right now 

3386
02:41:00,370 --> 02:41:03,311
where it's hard for people to get paid.
Doing digital stuff is much as most 

3387
02:41:05,481 --> 02:41:10,481
people don't want to subscribe to.
I shouldn't say it's hard for people to 

3388
02:41:10,481 --> 02:41:14,351
get paid.
It's hard for people to get people to 

3389
02:41:14,351 --> 02:41:15,260
pay for digital stuff.
I like to subscribe to an online website

3390
02:41:15,261 --> 02:41:17,540
or something done that's a tough sell.
You know?

3391
02:41:18,620 --> 02:41:23,620
Medium.com
is sort of filled that hole a little 

3392
02:41:23,620 --> 02:41:25,901
bit,
but you don't get directly paid from 

3393
02:41:25,901 --> 02:41:26,480
posting on there.
I don't believe people can get.

3394
02:41:26,510 --> 02:41:30,230
Make a medium post that had,
has then gone viral and gotten them paid

3395
02:41:30,231 --> 02:41:33,350
in other ways,
like explaining how they do a particular

3396
02:41:33,351 --> 02:41:38,351
thing and then that leads to their store
or they can sell some merge that way or 

3397
02:41:38,351 --> 02:41:39,220
other.
They might make a video that's in there.

3398
02:41:39,250 --> 02:41:41,000
Then they get you to money off of that.
It's a.

3399
02:41:41,660 --> 02:41:42,730
it's also new,
but that,

3400
02:41:42,950 --> 02:41:45,410
that what you're describing could take 
off from here.

3401
02:41:45,820 --> 02:41:50,820
Well,
it seems like if everybody decides to 

3402
02:41:50,820 --> 02:41:50,820
accept that currency,
then it seems like it would take off.

3403
02:41:50,820 --> 02:41:55,380
Right?
If everybody decided to accept that 

3404
02:41:55,380 --> 02:41:55,380
currency,
it just seems to me that there's,

3405
02:41:55,380 --> 02:41:56,420
if,
if bit.

3406
02:41:56,590 --> 02:41:58,060
There's a few tests,
right?

3407
02:41:58,061 --> 02:41:59,980
There's bid corn,
there's light coin is,

3408
02:42:00,020 --> 02:42:03,220
was that doggy coin,
Doge coin,

3409
02:42:03,250 --> 02:42:08,250
Doge coin.
There's a few of those that are still 

3410
02:42:08,250 --> 02:42:10,441
like volatile and still hanging.
I saw some article recently about these 

3411
02:42:10,441 --> 02:42:12,310
young guys that were multimillionaires 
from cryptocurrency,

3412
02:42:13,600 --> 02:42:14,140
like,
okay,

3413
02:42:14,850 --> 02:42:15,120
real

3414
02:42:15,320 --> 02:42:17,510
the millionaire or multimillionaire and 
cryptocurrency.

3415
02:42:17,530 --> 02:42:22,530
Like what does it mean?
Same as a stock person because they 

3416
02:42:22,530 --> 02:42:22,530
might have a bunch of money.
Then it's,

3417
02:42:22,530 --> 02:42:23,180
some of it's also in stock,
right?

3418
02:42:23,210 --> 02:42:25,640
Could they win?
How quickly could they liquidate?

3419
02:42:25,650 --> 02:42:27,830
It?
Somewhat depends on exchanges.

3420
02:42:27,831 --> 02:42:30,210
Some of it's 24 hours.
Some of it's a couple days.

3421
02:42:30,780 --> 02:42:33,620
It depends on the actual coin and the 
way the blockchain works.

3422
02:42:33,930 --> 02:42:35,860
Hmm.
Crazy.

3423
02:42:37,620 --> 02:42:38,700
Yeah,
it's very crazy.

3424
02:42:39,060 --> 02:42:40,680
It's very crazy.
It's,

3425
02:42:40,700 --> 02:42:41,520
um,
to be.

3426
02:42:41,521 --> 02:42:42,600
When I think about it,
I,

3427
02:42:42,601 --> 02:42:47,601
I always wonder how long it's going to 
take before we shake ourselves of this 

3428
02:42:47,601 --> 02:42:51,630
system because this system is good as it
is and it's definitely good.

3429
02:42:51,930 --> 02:42:56,820
It's still super complicated and flawed.
It's very confusing.

3430
02:42:56,920 --> 02:43:00,930
What's legal and what's illegal and why 
you have to pay taxes in one place,

3431
02:43:00,931 --> 02:43:04,290
but you crossed the line and the taxes 
are way less.

3432
02:43:04,291 --> 02:43:07,350
Like what?
Like over here,

3433
02:43:07,351 --> 02:43:11,830
you don't pay state taxes at all,
but over there you do what?

3434
02:43:12,600 --> 02:43:13,540
Like a lot of this stuff

3435
02:43:13,570 --> 02:43:18,570
that we operate,
a lot of the system that we have is 

3436
02:43:18,570 --> 02:43:18,570
fucking won.

3437
02:43:18,570 --> 02:43:19,780
He Shit.
The tax system is just one of them,

3438
02:43:19,781 --> 02:43:20,920
right?
Yeah.

3439
02:43:21,130 --> 02:43:23,650
It's all messed up and then a lot of 
people,

3440
02:43:23,651 --> 02:43:25,240
you know,
you can just whatever,

3441
02:43:25,450 --> 02:43:28,900
build a account overseas and avoid it 
that way.

3442
02:43:29,020 --> 02:43:29,950
Well,
it seems to me that

3443
02:43:29,980 --> 02:43:34,980
what I was gonna say is that if 
something like a crypto currency can 

3444
02:43:34,980 --> 02:43:35,620
really take off and just get fully 
accepted,

3445
02:43:35,621 --> 02:43:39,490
you switch to a more accepted now than 
it was a few years ago when Antonopoulos

3446
02:43:39,491 --> 02:43:43,630
first started coming on here and I think
you could sort of extrapolate that five,

3447
02:43:43,631 --> 02:43:46,060
maybe even 10 years from now.
It might be like really commonplace.

3448
02:43:46,210 --> 02:43:48,010
There's a lot of things you buy with 
bitcoin now.

3449
02:43:48,070 --> 02:43:53,070
A lot of things.
It's really kind of interesting in that 

3450
02:43:53,070 --> 02:43:53,070
way.

3451
02:43:53,070 --> 02:43:53,100
No,
that's.

3452
02:43:53,330 --> 02:43:56,090
If that works out and crypto coins 
become a real thing,

3453
02:43:56,091 --> 02:43:58,700
crypto currency becomes a real thing.
It's totally possible that can move into

3454
02:43:58,701 --> 02:44:03,701
politics.
That kind of thinking of organizing and 

3455
02:44:03,701 --> 02:44:07,691
like setting up a party and deciding on 
important issues that all could happen 

3456
02:44:08,330 --> 02:44:12,140
the same way that all could happen 
through some sort of an online app where

3457
02:44:12,141 --> 02:44:13,880
people say,
fuck all this voting shit.

3458
02:44:14,210 --> 02:44:16,350
You know,
we have this new super secure thing that

3459
02:44:16,351 --> 02:44:20,030
elan musk figured it out and now 
everybody,

3460
02:44:20,031 --> 02:44:25,031
all they have to do is have a cell phone
number and they take a photo of 

3461
02:44:25,031 --> 02:44:27,320
themselves as they're doing it.
So it's biometric,

3462
02:44:27,321 --> 02:44:29,210
right?
So you know that someone's not cheating.

3463
02:44:29,810 --> 02:44:33,220
You can take a photo of you,
you put in your vote and you do.

3464
02:44:33,530 --> 02:44:38,530
You have little videos for each issue.
Can Watch little videos on your phone 

3465
02:44:38,530 --> 02:44:39,500
tells you exactly what's going on with 
these gestures here.

3466
02:44:39,560 --> 02:44:44,560
People who are pro it here,
people are content and it's like one of 

3467
02:44:44,560 --> 02:44:44,560
those things where like if you ever 
test,

3468
02:44:44,560 --> 02:44:44,780
take a test online,

3469
02:44:45,790 --> 02:44:46,470
have you ever done one of them?

3470
02:44:47,010 --> 02:44:49,980
The end press send and you press it.
You know all the results,

3471
02:44:49,981 --> 02:44:53,010
all you got 90 percent right,
and so you move on.

3472
02:44:53,970 --> 02:44:55,590
That could be the same way.
I mean,

3473
02:44:55,591 --> 02:44:58,320
it could be something along those lines.
Those things are so easily beatable.

3474
02:44:58,321 --> 02:45:03,321
I decided to do that for traffic school.
Get out of a ticket a couple of weeks 

3475
02:45:03,321 --> 02:45:03,321
ago.
It's so ridiculous.

3476
02:45:03,321 --> 02:45:05,700
It tells you which ones are wrong on the
yes or no,

3477
02:45:05,701 --> 02:45:07,650
and they're like,
you want to try it again?

3478
02:45:08,130 --> 02:45:08,820
And I'm like,
uh,

3479
02:45:08,821 --> 02:45:13,110
yeah.
I don't think everyone's smart.

3480
02:45:13,880 --> 02:45:16,170
Yeah,
I finished a fun fact.

3481
02:45:16,171 --> 02:45:19,350
I finished traffic school.
What's supposed to be this huge test?

3482
02:45:19,351 --> 02:45:20,070
And like,
uh,

3483
02:45:20,190 --> 02:45:21,960
I don't know,
maybe nine minutes.

3484
02:45:22,980 --> 02:45:24,600
Just next,
next,

3485
02:45:24,601 --> 02:45:25,290
next,
next,

3486
02:45:25,291 --> 02:45:26,580
next.
Take the test.

3487
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:28,800
Whatever.
Then fix the answers.

3488
02:45:28,801 --> 02:45:31,530
Done.
They could do that with voting.

3489
02:45:32,490 --> 02:45:34,200
Yeah,
they could totally do that with voting.

3490
02:45:34,380 --> 02:45:36,470
Yeah.
Hundred percent.

3491
02:45:36,480 --> 02:45:38,490
They don't want it.
Didn't want it to be that easy.

3492
02:45:38,880 --> 02:45:41,730
And that's when there's going to be real
weird shit were like Logan.

3493
02:45:41,731 --> 02:45:45,360
Paul manipulates the vote.
You know what I'm saying?

3494
02:45:45,600 --> 02:45:48,270
Like I don't mean it illegally.
I mean like saying,

3495
02:45:48,271 --> 02:45:49,770
Hey,
go out and vote for this guy.

3496
02:45:49,960 --> 02:45:53,040
You know where Kim Kardashians.
I want you to vote for my friend.

3497
02:45:53,130 --> 02:45:53,400
You know,

3498
02:45:53,720 --> 02:45:58,720
she wants to run this motherfucker like 
a cartoon character becoming the leader.

3499
02:45:59,860 --> 02:46:02,810
Black mayor always has the best ideas.
I'm always late to the party.

3500
02:46:03,440 --> 02:46:08,440
I think it's coming.
I think Kanye could do it in 20 slash 

3501
02:46:08,440 --> 02:46:08,440
20.
If he runs,

3502
02:46:08,440 --> 02:46:09,260
he'll fall apart.
You don't do well under that of

3503
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:11,750
falling apart.
Could get you the role.

3504
02:46:11,760 --> 02:46:13,050
He's not.
He's not that guy.

3505
02:46:13,080 --> 02:46:16,500
He's not like that.
Trump guy trump let's that shit roll off

3506
02:46:16,501 --> 02:46:21,501
his back.
For most people that stuff devastating 

3507
02:46:21,501 --> 02:46:23,930
like I don't think it's a coincidence 
that Kanye had that event where he 

3508
02:46:23,930 --> 02:46:24,990
talked about supporting trump that he 
would've voted on trump.

3509
02:46:24,991 --> 02:46:28,470
That's what he said it and everybody 
went crazy and then he went crazy and he

3510
02:46:28,500 --> 02:46:33,240
checked himself into a eight days for 
eight days in the hospital.

3511
02:46:33,460 --> 02:46:35,180
Like it's not good.
Right?

3512
02:46:35,220 --> 02:46:36,990
That's,
that's not a person who's good,

3513
02:46:37,170 --> 02:46:39,360
who knows what the fuck was going on 
outside of that.

3514
02:46:39,870 --> 02:46:43,680
But the scrutiny it compounded it with 
no question at all.

3515
02:46:43,710 --> 02:46:48,710
When a bunch of people are mad at you 
and all your fans are mad at you and 

3516
02:46:48,710 --> 02:46:48,710
then you wind up canceling the whole 
tour.

3517
02:46:49,520 --> 02:46:50,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

3518
02:46:51,230 --> 02:46:52,410
That's,
that guy.

3519
02:46:52,411 --> 02:46:55,650
Shouldn't you know,
obviously shouldn't be president,

3520
02:46:56,040 --> 02:46:57,270
but I don't even think she's try.

3521
02:46:57,570 --> 02:47:02,570
I just don't think.
Just seems like a lot of pressure for 

3522
02:47:02,570 --> 02:47:05,181
them.
And these fucking great musician make 

3523
02:47:05,181 --> 02:47:07,440
your awesome music.
And music don't run for president.

3524
02:47:07,690 --> 02:47:09,720
Like when do you think we're ever going 
to get off of this?

3525
02:47:09,721 --> 02:47:10,620
Like people keep saying,
you know,

3526
02:47:10,621 --> 02:47:15,621
Alec Baldwin,
you can actually run and win for the 

3527
02:47:15,621 --> 02:47:15,870
Democrats came.
Maybe could you might be right.

3528
02:47:15,871 --> 02:47:20,010
He might be able to totally put when.
When do we say,

3529
02:47:20,011 --> 02:47:20,760
hey,
we need.

3530
02:47:20,940 --> 02:47:22,920
We need to rethink this whole fucking 
system.

3531
02:47:23,310 --> 02:47:25,890
We can't keep letting popular people run
the country.

3532
02:47:26,130 --> 02:47:28,440
That's crazy.
I have to do is to be popular.

3533
02:47:28,620 --> 02:47:29,610
I like him more.

3534
02:47:30,290 --> 02:47:32,510
The whole thing.
That's been the thing forever.

3535
02:47:33,300 --> 02:47:35,780
It's weird.
It doesn't make any sense.

3536
02:47:36,220 --> 02:47:41,220
Shouldn't you have to take a test?
And we find out who would be best at 

3537
02:47:41,220 --> 02:47:41,220
running the country.
Like shouldn't it be a test?

3538
02:47:41,220 --> 02:47:46,051
Like there's a test for the driver's 
license for graphics test for traveling 

3539
02:47:46,051 --> 02:47:47,920
school.
Why is there a test for president?

3540
02:47:48,070 --> 02:47:49,240
Shouldn't it?
You'd be like,

3541
02:47:49,810 --> 02:47:54,810
Shit.
You have to have some good answers to 

3542
02:47:54,810 --> 02:47:54,810
some questions.
They pose it you.

3543
02:47:54,810 --> 02:47:55,180
It's the most ridiculous job ever 
because it was.

3544
02:47:55,510 --> 02:48:00,400
It was created so long ago that has so 
many holes in the idea behind it.

3545
02:48:00,850 --> 02:48:04,660
Like you don't have to eat at least know
how to run the country like Pe.

3546
02:48:04,690 --> 02:48:06,610
Shouldn't.
People know the results of your test?

3547
02:48:06,790 --> 02:48:08,500
You should take a test and the people 
say,

3548
02:48:08,501 --> 02:48:10,600
look,
we've got good news and bad news.

3549
02:48:10,601 --> 02:48:15,601
The good news is he can read.
The bad news is he got everything wrong.

3550
02:48:16,810 --> 02:48:18,520
He got everything wrong.
You can't be president.

3551
02:48:18,550 --> 02:48:19,030
Like,
oh,

3552
02:48:19,031 --> 02:48:20,590
all right,
well we got to find a guy who could pass

3553
02:48:20,591 --> 02:48:23,770
the test is also popular.
Then people will try to cheat for them.

3554
02:48:24,030 --> 02:48:25,120
Yeah,
you can keep

3555
02:48:25,310 --> 02:48:26,900
budget.
Who can speak?

3556
02:48:26,901 --> 02:48:31,670
Who Can Obama at least taught Congo 
Gresh or constitutional law?

3557
02:48:32,520 --> 02:48:35,690
At least I think he would know a lot 
constitution.

3558
02:48:35,900 --> 02:48:40,900
I would imagine those quite a bit.
Heard of trump university.

3559
02:48:41,691 --> 02:48:44,720
My friend got a whole universe.
Lawson.

3560
02:48:44,750 --> 02:48:48,110
He had his own university.
How many lawsuits are involved in that?

3561
02:48:48,470 --> 02:48:50,450
Don't know how many.
I think it became a class action.

3562
02:48:50,451 --> 02:48:52,460
You had to pick $25,000,000
or something.

3563
02:48:53,660 --> 02:48:57,410
Sorry,
what was trump university?

3564
02:48:58,390 --> 02:48:59,470
It was a,
uh,

3565
02:48:59,520 --> 02:49:01,120
like a one minute left.
Jamie.

3566
02:49:02,350 --> 02:49:04,220
Yeah,
because it was like a real estate.

3567
02:49:04,221 --> 02:49:09,090
They show you how to turn and burn and 
flip houses and businesses and they show

3568
02:49:09,091 --> 02:49:14,091
you how to become a real estate mogul 
for profit education company that ran 

3569
02:49:14,091 --> 02:49:15,270
real estate training program for five 
years.

3570
02:49:15,900 --> 02:49:17,870
Was it any good?
Uh,

3571
02:49:18,060 --> 02:49:20,400
like where the sort of success stories 
out of it.

3572
02:49:20,880 --> 02:49:25,880
I don't know.
It was licensed by trump university by 

3573
02:49:25,880 --> 02:49:27,840
owned by trump organization,
but not owned by the trump organization.

3574
02:49:29,220 --> 02:49:31,750
Probably a different LLC or something.
Oh,

3575
02:49:31,810 --> 02:49:35,970
go multiple lawsuits.
What a interesting idea.

3576
02:49:36,510 --> 02:49:38,700
Who's just going to teach people how to 
make money?

3577
02:49:39,690 --> 02:49:40,950
So the idea.
Yeah.

3578
02:49:41,430 --> 02:49:45,060
It seems like one of those infomercials 
or something like that.

3579
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:51,000
He's a fucking character.
I'll tell you that when all is said and 

3580
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:54,151
done,
that will be a guy that stands out in 

3581
02:49:54,151 --> 02:49:54,340
human history.
We're going to look at that guy and go,

3582
02:49:54,341 --> 02:49:57,450
wow.
I think that's what he wanted.

3583
02:49:58,630 --> 02:50:03,630
He definitely got that.
Do you think he's going to want to run 

3584
02:50:03,630 --> 02:50:03,630
again?
Oh my God,

3585
02:50:03,630 --> 02:50:05,930
yes.
Are you kidding me?

3586
02:50:06,200 --> 02:50:08,810
Are you kidding me?
This is what this guy lives for.

3587
02:50:08,811 --> 02:50:12,060
He lives for watching the news and 
seeing him on it every day.

3588
02:50:12,620 --> 02:50:15,710
Is that what they think?
I'll show them that this whole thing.

3589
02:50:15,800 --> 02:50:20,800
It's so real.
Everything from the insight and 

3590
02:50:20,800 --> 02:50:20,800
everything I've ever heard about.
The guy says that,

3591
02:50:20,800 --> 02:50:21,680
that he's just.
I mean,

3592
02:50:22,630 --> 02:50:23,890
how much longer do you think you could 
do it?

3593
02:50:24,430 --> 02:50:27,580
At what age do you start to get worn out
by all this shit?

3594
02:50:28,300 --> 02:50:33,300
Right.
We think of the kind of hate Kanye got 

3595
02:50:33,300 --> 02:50:36,600
for supporting trump.
Now think of the kind of hate trump 

3596
02:50:36,600 --> 02:50:37,660
gets.
It is some next level stuff.

3597
02:50:38,190 --> 02:50:43,190
I mean the you have to have some crazy 
resolve to be able to absorb that kind 

3598
02:50:43,190 --> 02:50:43,190
of.
Hey,

3599
02:50:43,190 --> 02:50:43,930
you got to be a little insulated from 
some of it though,

3600
02:50:44,170 --> 02:50:47,020
I'm sure.
But they might hide him from some of it,

3601
02:50:47,050 --> 02:50:49,090
but some of it they actually project on 
his building.

3602
02:50:50,410 --> 02:50:52,780
You know,
they project it on his building.

3603
02:50:52,990 --> 02:50:55,000
They stand across the street with a 
projector.

3604
02:50:58,760 --> 02:51:00,310
Isn't even dealing with that forever 
though.

3605
02:51:00,370 --> 02:51:02,560
Not that I don't think so.

3606
02:51:02,860 --> 02:51:04,810
Wwe Hall of Famer,
by the way,

3607
02:51:04,870 --> 02:51:05,440
isn't he?
Yeah,

3608
02:51:05,441 --> 02:51:06,400
he's been in stone.
Cold.

3609
02:51:06,401 --> 02:51:09,070
Stunned.
He's been stone cold stone.

3610
02:51:09,100 --> 02:51:10,870
Yeah.
He was in a stone cold stunner.

3611
02:51:10,871 --> 02:51:11,470
How's that?
Go down,

3612
02:51:11,680 --> 02:51:14,200
you don't want to know this one.
Now I'm going to be honest with you,

3613
02:51:14,201 --> 02:51:19,201
joe,
out of all the one of the many pro 

3614
02:51:19,201 --> 02:51:19,201
wrestling moves that don't seem to be 
effective.

3615
02:51:19,201 --> 02:51:24,121
This is way up there and the devastation
that leaves like guys are like out for 

3616
02:51:24,161 --> 02:51:27,610
like a minute after a stone cold stunner
and it's pretty bad.

3617
02:51:27,640 --> 02:51:29,170
I'm going to be honest.
I love stone cold.

3618
02:51:29,740 --> 02:51:32,470
One of the greats ever.
Probably the reason why we have the rock

3619
02:51:32,471 --> 02:51:35,890
is because stone cold was so raw and a 
dirty on the mic.

3620
02:51:35,950 --> 02:51:37,390
Let me ask you this,
and I want you to be real.

3621
02:51:37,590 --> 02:51:39,900
You think that this stone cold stunner 
existed?

3622
02:51:39,910 --> 02:51:43,270
Why?
Because he lost a haircut match between,

3623
02:51:43,271 --> 02:51:44,350
uh,
Vince and,

3624
02:51:44,351 --> 02:51:47,110
uh,
between Vince and trump won was going to

3625
02:51:47,111 --> 02:51:48,310
get zapped.
And Bobby Lashley.

3626
02:51:48,430 --> 02:51:49,300
Yeah.
See,

3627
02:51:49,301 --> 02:51:50,590
I know my shit dude.
Hell yeah.

3628
02:51:50,591 --> 02:51:55,591
You do.
So the stone cold stunner Steve Austin 

3629
02:51:55,591 --> 02:51:57,700
as his arm up in the air column for cans
of Beers.

3630
02:51:57,701 --> 02:52:00,520
That's another thing is every time still
with cans of beer,

3631
02:52:01,030 --> 02:52:03,820
they drink it and they let him go drink 
one in the middle of the fight.

3632
02:52:04,060 --> 02:52:05,890
He doesn't really know fights over

3633
02:52:06,280 --> 02:52:07,660
fights book.
He's about to cheers.

3634
02:52:07,661 --> 02:52:09,160
Donald trump.
Steve Wiser.

3635
02:52:09,340 --> 02:52:11,710
Okay.
Why is he wearing a shirt?

3636
02:52:12,370 --> 02:52:14,560
See,
wrestling has rf in this.

3637
02:52:14,561 --> 02:52:16,410
He was a ref,
but he's still about the stun.

3638
02:52:16,420 --> 02:52:17,590
Here you go.
Boom.

3639
02:52:17,620 --> 02:52:18,700
He hit some.
Boom.

3640
02:52:19,570 --> 02:52:24,570
He lands on his butt,
but your head is on his shoulder and 

3641
02:52:24,570 --> 02:52:24,570
it's supposed to just put you out.
Wait a minute,

3642
02:52:24,570 --> 02:52:27,220
one more time please.
Just so odd.

3643
02:52:27,280 --> 02:52:29,660
So I stepped forward.
Let's get a good angle.

3644
02:52:29,810 --> 02:52:31,750
Find the wine.
Boom.

3645
02:52:32,530 --> 02:52:34,330
Bam.
Jamie.

3646
02:52:34,331 --> 02:52:38,230
There's one were stone cold like stuns 
every mcmahon and everybody in a ring.

3647
02:52:38,231 --> 02:52:39,730
Like there's,
there was one epic one.

3648
02:52:39,731 --> 02:52:44,731
Were you stunned like 30 guys in a row?
It might be one of the faker things 

3649
02:52:44,731 --> 02:52:48,181
ever.
I've seen you repost some of bad things 

3650
02:52:48,181 --> 02:52:50,980
that have been happening.
Feeling it hurts every time.

3651
02:52:51,370 --> 02:52:52,360
Well,
you know,

3652
02:52:52,450 --> 02:52:53,910
you need higher quality,
uh,

3653
02:52:54,340 --> 02:52:55,150
stuff out there.

3654
02:52:55,660 --> 02:52:56,740
See,
that's a stunner.

3655
02:52:56,770 --> 02:52:58,570
That's a stunner right there.
Technically.

3656
02:52:58,571 --> 02:53:00,370
Yes.
Boom.

3657
02:53:00,870 --> 02:53:02,380
Oh,
come rock knew how to sell that.

3658
02:53:03,270 --> 02:53:04,930
Kaine.
That's the undertakers brother.

3659
02:53:05,110 --> 02:53:05,680
Goodbye.
Yeah,

3660
02:53:05,681 --> 02:53:07,390
the rock made it fun.
Right?

3661
02:53:07,670 --> 02:53:12,670
Like it didn't seem realistic.
I read a thing recently about how the 

3662
02:53:12,670 --> 02:53:16,201
peoples elbow,
which became his big finishing move and 

3663
02:53:16,201 --> 02:53:18,841
it was sort of a joke that worked so 
well with the crowd that they all just 

3664
02:53:18,841 --> 02:53:20,710
laughed about it backstage and it just 
became this fucking.

3665
02:53:20,760 --> 02:53:21,850
Okay.
Let me tell you something.

3666
02:53:21,880 --> 02:53:23,970
If this guy did this to actually do the 
suit,

3667
02:53:23,971 --> 02:53:25,990
it would not feel good to.
This is,

3668
02:53:26,020 --> 02:53:28,810
this is not a real finishing move per 
se,

3669
02:53:29,050 --> 02:53:31,390
but that could fuck you up.
Especially a big strong guy.

3670
02:53:31,391 --> 02:53:33,280
Like you're not that one,
not that one,

3671
02:53:33,820 --> 02:53:36,100
but some of them.
Because what he's doing is he's grabbing

3672
02:53:36,101 --> 02:53:40,510
the back of your head and slamming his 
shoulder into your chin.

3673
02:53:40,540 --> 02:53:41,480
Yeah,
like,

3674
02:53:41,560 --> 02:53:45,070
that's semi legit.
Like I would not recommend doing it that

3675
02:53:45,071 --> 02:53:47,710
way.
We'll look at the rock by laughing.

3676
02:53:48,290 --> 02:53:50,600
Stood up after he got some.

3677
02:53:52,980 --> 02:53:55,060
Uh Oh,
look at this.

3678
02:53:55,061 --> 02:54:00,061
That's Shane Mcmahon.
But we play that one again.

3679
02:54:00,280 --> 02:54:01,450
Boom.
Oh,

3680
02:54:01,451 --> 02:54:05,680
that's hilarious.
Classic Mcmahon thing to oversell like a

3681
02:54:05,730 --> 02:54:08,170
stunner like that.
Like Vince does it the best.

3682
02:54:08,171 --> 02:54:12,280
He convulses and shakes afterwards.
Definitely have that though.

3683
02:54:12,281 --> 02:54:13,690
Because you're given the guy you're 
back.

3684
02:54:13,770 --> 02:54:15,730
Yeah.
I don't recommend that at all.

3685
02:54:15,790 --> 02:54:18,550
That move now.
He could probably do it to me.

3686
02:54:18,850 --> 02:54:20,200
Yeah,
but that would hurt.

3687
02:54:20,350 --> 02:54:22,720
I'm telling you that's not.
It's not the best move in the world.

3688
02:54:22,790 --> 02:54:25,240
No,
but it's not 100 percent legitimate.

3689
02:54:25,930 --> 02:54:26,770
There's brock.
Now.

3690
02:54:26,771 --> 02:54:28,660
This is Shane Mcmahon.
This is actually.

3691
02:54:28,810 --> 02:54:31,240
Oh,
really insane thing that this guy did.

3692
02:54:32,040 --> 02:54:35,110
Tony,
do you know Shane right now is probably.

3693
02:54:35,111 --> 02:54:39,310
If I had to guess,
I'd say a 47.

3694
02:54:39,460 --> 02:54:42,580
No,
he's not jumping off about 30 feet.

3695
02:54:42,581 --> 02:54:45,520
Thirty five feet up at least probably.
I don't know if they actually say,

3696
02:54:45,521 --> 02:54:48,640
but get the fuck out of Shane Mcmahon 
always does this.

3697
02:54:48,641 --> 02:54:49,720
He is like,
wait a minute,

3698
02:54:49,750 --> 02:54:50,620
wait a minute,
wait a minute,

3699
02:54:50,621 --> 02:54:53,950
wait a minute onto a table.
Come on a real table.

3700
02:54:53,980 --> 02:54:55,870
The undertakers about don't move.
Either way.

3701
02:54:55,871 --> 02:55:00,871
It's not a pad.
The undertakers like,

3702
02:55:00,971 --> 02:55:01,840
don't do it,
dude.

3703
02:55:03,080 --> 02:55:03,860
I'm not going to show it to you.

3704
02:55:04,150 --> 02:55:05,050
Oh,
I see.

3705
02:55:05,051 --> 02:55:05,380
Dot.
Yeah,

3706
02:55:05,381 --> 02:55:07,360
don't show it on Youtube.
So he lands on that thing,

3707
02:55:07,361 --> 02:55:08,920
so it's a giant spring underneath them.

3708
02:55:09,560 --> 02:55:11,270
Now.
What is that thing?

3709
02:55:11,300 --> 02:55:14,260
It's just a breakaway table at home.
Mine.

3710
02:55:14,300 --> 02:55:19,300
It hurts.
That's insane that he did that and we 

3711
02:55:19,300 --> 02:55:19,300
all thought he was pretty messed up 
here.

3712
02:55:19,300 --> 02:55:20,940
Oh my God.
That's insane.

3713
02:55:21,030 --> 02:55:24,900
Why did he do that Shit for the show?
Oh my God.

3714
02:55:24,901 --> 02:55:27,270
That guy had to get really hurt.
If you get knocked out,

3715
02:55:28,340 --> 02:55:29,450
uh,
he might be.

3716
02:55:29,460 --> 02:55:31,530
Might be coming out of it.
We,

3717
02:55:31,590 --> 02:55:36,590
that's one of the crazy things.
You just never know what's real and 

3718
02:55:36,590 --> 02:55:36,590
what's not.
Why got it?

3719
02:55:36,590 --> 02:55:36,590
Yeah.
Mankind did that.

3720
02:55:36,590 --> 02:55:38,390
Mick Foley,
the guy who does the mandible claw,

3721
02:55:38,430 --> 02:55:42,630
he did that to the undertaker.
Once he had a tooth go through his lip.

3722
02:55:42,750 --> 02:55:44,910
Let me ask you this,
when someone does something like that,

3723
02:55:44,911 --> 02:55:48,390
like did they plan that out to the point
where they practice it or they just wait

3724
02:55:48,391 --> 02:55:52,170
to the moment and then do it?
Because that seems like a.

3725
02:55:52,171 --> 02:55:57,171
If you practice it and it hurt that bad,
I think they might practice it maybe 

3726
02:55:57,171 --> 02:56:01,910
with some type of something,
but I don't think they practice it with 

3727
02:56:01,910 --> 02:56:03,630
a breakaway table and these guys are 
fighting on top of the roof.

3728
02:56:03,780 --> 02:56:07,470
This is the craziest one ever.
This is Helen is sell 1998.

3729
02:56:07,471 --> 02:56:11,190
Mankind is the undertaker.
This is crazy.

3730
02:56:11,191 --> 02:56:16,191
Undertaker ends up choking,
slamming him through the whole thing 

3731
02:56:16,191 --> 02:56:16,191
into the ring from the top.

3732
02:56:16,191 --> 02:56:19,160
But you think you know more about pro 
wrestling than I know about boxing.

3733
02:56:20,680 --> 02:56:21,790
Well,
it's a.

3734
02:56:21,910 --> 02:56:26,910
it's a wide field.
I think there's more in wrestling 

3735
02:56:26,910 --> 02:56:26,910
history.
You got to realize wrestling.

3736
02:56:27,060 --> 02:56:32,060
Wrestling's been a weekly sport,
the most watched program on cable every 

3737
02:56:32,060 --> 02:56:35,791
Monday since I was a little kid.
So there's a lot more stuff that's 

3738
02:56:35,791 --> 02:56:35,791
happened in pro wrestling.

3739
02:56:35,791 --> 02:56:37,410
Right.
But you know results,

3740
02:56:37,411 --> 02:56:38,490
right?
Yeah.

3741
02:56:38,700 --> 02:56:42,470
Like if I told you,
I mean,

3742
02:56:42,510 --> 02:56:45,690
do you know any results from boxing a 
little bit?

3743
02:56:45,770 --> 02:56:50,770
You know,
way more about this than you know about 

3744
02:56:50,770 --> 02:56:50,770
boxing,
right?

3745
02:56:50,770 --> 02:56:50,770
Yeah.

3746
02:56:50,770 --> 02:56:51,690
Yeah.
You find that weird.

3747
02:56:52,080 --> 02:56:53,820
No,
I'm pretty big boxing fan.

3748
02:56:54,820 --> 02:56:57,120
I probably had more than one.
Threw them off the top.

3749
02:56:57,121 --> 02:56:57,770
Yeah.
They go.

3750
02:56:57,930 --> 02:56:59,340
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

3751
02:56:59,410 --> 02:57:00,750
Where's he throw them onto?
And by the way,

3752
02:57:00,751 --> 02:57:02,890
that's the first time anything like this
ever happened.

3753
02:57:02,891 --> 02:57:04,690
So that crowd is literally like,
what?

3754
02:57:04,810 --> 02:57:05,230
Blah Blah Blah.

3755
02:57:05,760 --> 02:57:07,150
Okay.
I go fucked up.

3756
02:57:07,190 --> 02:57:09,730
Yeah.
Like he got fucked up for real.

3757
02:57:09,880 --> 02:57:13,750
I don't think you can fall that far.
Knock fucked up unless you're in falling

3758
02:57:13,751 --> 02:57:16,060
into a giant pillow.
These guys aren't falling.

3759
02:57:16,090 --> 02:57:16,990
Oh my God.

3760
02:57:18,110 --> 02:57:21,370
No.
Mick Foley has like broken every bone in

3761
02:57:21,740 --> 02:57:23,720
every injury you can imagine.
Oh my God.

3762
02:57:23,721 --> 02:57:24,350
You see?
That

3763
02:57:24,780 --> 02:57:27,040
seemed to do a back flip and land right 
there.

3764
02:57:27,670 --> 02:57:28,990
Fuck that dude.
Oh,

3765
02:57:28,991 --> 02:57:31,780
water's good.
So that's a good move.

3766
02:57:32,020 --> 02:57:34,510
So they're doing it like that Ninja 
show.

3767
02:57:35,570 --> 02:57:37,270
That's obviously.
It was on boxes.

3768
02:57:37,600 --> 02:57:39,940
Obviously.
That's protected.

3769
02:57:40,180 --> 02:57:45,180
That's so funny.
The whole dramatic thing that girls are 

3770
02:57:45,180 --> 02:57:45,180
going,
oh my God.

3771
02:57:45,180 --> 02:57:45,180
Oh my God.
And the guys.

3772
02:57:45,180 --> 02:57:45,900
They're macho.

3773
02:57:46,080 --> 02:57:49,110
Yeah.
He just felt fucking cage.

3774
02:57:49,410 --> 02:57:50,980
It fell through this gauge.
Oh my God.

3775
02:57:50,981 --> 02:57:53,290
Is that supposed to happen?
Was that an accident?

3776
02:57:53,480 --> 02:57:54,940
No,
I don't know.

3777
02:57:56,110 --> 02:57:59,390
That may be.
Was supposed to happen the way it falls.

3778
02:57:59,410 --> 02:58:04,410
He fell into the center.
I bet it was to happen because see how 

3779
02:58:04,410 --> 02:58:06,240
the center sort of gave in now how would
they engineer something like that.

3780
02:58:06,300 --> 02:58:09,540
How will they make sure that they're 
okay?

3781
02:58:09,541 --> 02:58:11,310
Like this is like a combination.
Oh my God.

3782
02:58:11,320 --> 02:58:13,020
I broke her leg.
Did he?

3783
02:58:13,170 --> 02:58:14,070
I think so.
Oh,

3784
02:58:14,080 --> 02:58:16,850
don't show me.
This show is canceled.

3785
02:58:17,350 --> 02:58:21,530
Can't watch somebody breaking their leg 
for a play as essentially a play magic.

3786
02:58:21,550 --> 02:58:24,030
There's a play where you break your leg.
I mean,

3787
02:58:24,200 --> 02:58:25,890
remember when people were criticizing 
Spiderman,

3788
02:58:26,970 --> 02:58:28,140
spiderman,
musical people,

3789
02:58:28,141 --> 02:58:31,860
kept flying off the harnesses and 
slamming into the crowd or something.

3790
02:58:33,090 --> 02:58:35,700
I think somebody might have died.
Oh yeah.

3791
02:58:35,790 --> 02:58:37,920
Um,
severe injury at the very least.

3792
02:58:38,100 --> 02:58:40,530
What happened during Spiderman musical?
Because that's.

3793
02:58:40,531 --> 02:58:45,531
I think they got it wired though.
Think they figured it out or don't show 

3794
02:58:45,531 --> 02:58:45,531
it to me,
bro.

3795
02:58:45,531 --> 02:58:46,120
Please show.
I don't want to see the god.

3796
02:58:46,330 --> 02:58:49,200
Oh fuck.
The thing snapped.

3797
02:58:49,820 --> 02:58:51,930
Roped didn't work.
Oh my God.

3798
02:58:51,960 --> 02:58:54,030
Jesus Christ.
Wow.

3799
02:58:54,120 --> 02:58:57,280
Oh my God.
It's going to have to a PD die.

3800
02:58:59,320 --> 02:59:04,320
Now this accident,
Spiderman doesn't want to say that.

3801
02:59:04,721 --> 02:59:06,270
There's more than one accident.
Yeah.

3802
02:59:06,271 --> 02:59:08,370
I thought it kept happening.
That's why they had to stop.

3803
02:59:08,430 --> 02:59:13,430
Yeah.
I want to say there was a second 

3804
02:59:13,430 --> 02:59:13,430
accident that I might have been making 
this up.

3805
02:59:14,010 --> 02:59:16,590
This video I just pulled up here as the 
fourth accident.

3806
02:59:16,740 --> 02:59:18,630
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

3807
02:59:18,910 --> 02:59:23,910
The Lord Right now.
Stop and think about how many accidents 

3808
02:59:23,910 --> 02:59:26,850
they have in the pro wrestling world all
the time.

3809
02:59:27,210 --> 02:59:28,640
Yeah.
Arenas week,

3810
02:59:28,800 --> 02:59:31,290
multiple arenas per week.
So yeah.

3811
02:59:31,291 --> 02:59:33,660
And how many of those things must go 
wrong in those arenas?

3812
02:59:33,690 --> 02:59:34,890
People have died.
Yeah,

3813
02:59:35,050 --> 02:59:35,720
yeah,
yeah.

3814
02:59:35,940 --> 02:59:37,260
Allen Hart.
Fuck.

3815
02:59:37,290 --> 02:59:38,360
You know about Owen,
right?

3816
02:59:38,420 --> 02:59:39,720
Yeah.
On the entrance.

3817
02:59:40,170 --> 02:59:41,770
Yeah.
A character.

3818
02:59:41,880 --> 02:59:45,630
He didn't even want to play.
Dude.

3819
02:59:46,370 --> 02:59:48,170
Hard way to make a living.
Yeah.

3820
02:59:48,880 --> 02:59:51,330
All right Tony,
let's wrap this bitch up and head out to
