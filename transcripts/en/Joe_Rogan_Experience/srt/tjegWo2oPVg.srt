1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,890
Have you had him on wheeler?
Oh No.

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:10,150
Are we don't had about punchdrunk.
You can't tell everybody.

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,430
A lot of people that don't get mad when 
they find him in the middle.

4
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:25,700
He goes,
this ben talking.

5
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,110
He might be going crazy,
but I know that guy.

6
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,700
Yeah,
I know both of them.

7
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:32,534
The different dudes

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,010
podcast is wheeler,
like he's different than when he came on

9
00:00:37,011 --> 00:00:38,390
the podcast as the other fella.

10
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,390
He's been doing these promos where he 
does voice over like a famous person,

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,380
so it's like garth brooks talking talks 
over.

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,211
He's like,
Hey,

13
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:51,710
it's me.
Got Me my private jet.

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,920
I hate regular people like this.
I love with my instagram.

15
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,520
Tommy,
you showed me the video.

16
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,450
He.
Garth brooks here.

17
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:05,030
I won't tell you about my new favorite 
records.

18
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:05,870
Hold whole.
We'll buy.

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,770
We'll walk the junior.
I love blacks in here on my private jet.

20
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,920
I don't fly commercial anymore.
There's always a bunch of dumb crackers.

21
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:15,820
Who will want my autograph thing?
Little place with them.

22
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,023
I liked being by myself and got enough 
dick to go round and have a look at my 

23
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:24,980
dick.
So I'll see you guys later.

24
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:26,310
I'm Clark books on set.

25
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,553
Looking at the bottom,
it says it's been retweeted by Garth 

26
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:40,290
Brooks.
No photoshop him.

27
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,680
Re tweeting from Garcia.
Fake Shit with his face was like,

28
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,200
this is a call to garth brooks.
This is,

29
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:53,870
this is a call to find out how cool you 
are.

30
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,510
You should retweet,
retweet that shit out on instagram.

31
00:01:58,511 --> 00:01:59,680
Garth.
That shit's hilarious.

32
00:01:59,681 --> 00:02:02,480
And garth Brooks Fan.
I don't give a fuck what anybody says,

33
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,933
but that uh,
friends in low places with that comes 

34
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:07,844
on.
You don't get excited.

35
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,970
No Man.
It's all right.

36
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,950
It's fine.
Bar Jam.

37
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,540
I listened to a country boy can survive.
I'll get fired up for that.

38
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,830
Complete books.
I'm making a point about that song.

39
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,600
That's a killer song.
Fuck yeah,

40
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:29,750
it is like riding a horse.
Riding Cowboy.

41
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,420
I want to fucking be in a pickup to 
drink beer.

42
00:02:32,421 --> 00:02:35,180
I want to have a dip in.
I want to shoot somebody.

43
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,220
Hank Williams Jr.
Motherfucker.

44
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,320
Yeah.
That song is fantastic.

45
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,960
That's w.
That was Matt hughes walkout song.

46
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,853
Yeah,
that's right.

47
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,093
Yeah.
I had a fight for that country board 

48
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,540
cancer by a great song.
That's a great walkout song too.

49
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,840
That might be the best walkout town song
ever.

50
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,450
Oh no,
it's raining men.

51
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,690
Me if I ever.
But you know what?

52
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,780
Making girls might be the best when it 
comes out to nikki.

53
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:08,933
That might be the best know.
That's fucking because that one's not 

54
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,090
taken seriously.
LegitimatelY hilarious that he comes out

55
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:20,590
to that and he's a beautiful man.
Did he wear weird shiT?

56
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,170
Like different colors,
like pink stuff,

57
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:24,120
like as a,
making a,

58
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,053
someone did write,
but I went to a fight once where some 

59
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:32,040
dude came out like in a,
in a tutu or some shit and yeah,

60
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,033
some.
So he was wearing like something girly 

61
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:37,120
and everybody was like,
he better with shit.

62
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,760
Something like,
I don't know,

63
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,810
like a skirt or something.

64
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,800
And they walked up and down the aisle,
whatever.

65
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,693
Well there was one dude who fought in k,
one who was a famous crossdresser in 

66
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:50,584
Japan and it was a bad motherfucker.
He wasn't like necessarily a constant 

67
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:55,084
cross dresser,
but occasionally he would dress up like 

68
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:57,400
a school girl.
Yeah,

69
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,210
iT was cool.
What is this?

70
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,123
He,
this dude beat the fuck out of some 

71
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:06,410
people who like underestimated him 
dressed up like a school girl sees me to

72
00:04:06,411 --> 00:04:11,411
find that story.
I remember it was ballsy was Japan.

73
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:16,210
They go crazy.
He did some weird shit.

74
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:18,610
Were dressed up like a female and I'm a 
character or something.

75
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:21,520
I can't really remember entirely how the
story went down,

76
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,623
but I remember he could fight and it was
super confusing for people because he 

77
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:27,244
was knocking dudes dead and you know,
in the part time we dress up like a 

78
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:35,221
school girl fight girl outfit.
JusT do that.

79
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,910
I'm like,
come out with pigtails and shit.

80
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:48,210
Fuck soMebody's world up and then lick 
your lollipop on tHe way out.

81
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,480
The fucking brutus the barber beefcake 
shoW.

82
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,200
That would be some next level mind game 
shit like your past all the aggreSsion.

83
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,620
That's nonsense.
I'm trying to.

84
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,540
I'm a girl.
I'm gonna fuck You up,

85
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:08,020
but I'm going to pretend I'm a girl up 
until the moment I fuck you up.

86
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,550
Yeah,
that's,

87
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,790
that's the polar opposite of what other 
dudes go.

88
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,940
If you could pull that off,
you'd be so relaxed in a fight.

89
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,313
If You could figure out how to act like 
a girl in front of a dude was ready to 

90
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:25,480
beat the fuck out of the closet.
Queeny gay In the ufc,

91
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,110
but it was super well trained.
That'd be awesome.

92
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,160
That will be best to totally post fight 
interviews would be amazing.

93
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,530
Amazing.
Yeah.

94
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,350
It's completely biased there that it's 
completely possible.

95
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,683
Yeah.
Completely putting a call out to the 

96
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:47,071

00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,100
Yeah.
Umbrella.

101
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,870
Ufc 94.
Oh no,

102
00:06:04,871 --> 00:06:05,830
no.
This is a.

103
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,620
Isn't this?
Oh no.

104
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,350
Just the one you saw tom.
No,

105
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,743
no,
no.

106
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,903
Yeah,
yeah.

107
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,480
This is the.
A ufc fight where he came and translated

108
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,110
girl.
Yeah.

109
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,010
Did a choreographed.
Great.

110
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,360
Just the one you're thinking of.
Are you thinking about the japanese?

111
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,550
The japanese one,
but this one I remember now.

112
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,290
He did a choreographed dance.
I forgot about this.

113
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,110
Jamie.
This is a strong pole.

114
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,090
Strong selection was good,
right?

115
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,990
Dude,
I don't remember this at all.

116
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,970
Did he win this fight?
I hope so.

117
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,820
I don't remember who gono fought weight.
Well,

118
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:45,910
if you just go further fan video.
Oh,

119
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:47,020
it's a family day.
Oh,

120
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,080
hockey hero.
gono.

121
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:49,991
Yeah.
He was like,

122
00:06:49,991 --> 00:06:53,020
uh,
and I think he was in judo.

123
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,800
He was definitely a japanese star.
You a lot of those guys,

124
00:06:56,801 --> 00:06:58,480
by the time they came to the United 
States,

125
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,080
they already had been in so many words.
They just weren't the same anymore.

126
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,363
Like,
go me,

127
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,810
go.
Me wasn'T the same anymore.

128
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:06,980
Saccharide wasn't the same anymore.
Yeah.

129
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,180
Look at this.
Oh my god.

130
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,640
So good move,
man.

131
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,080
Yeah,
too good move.

132
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,590
I'd like to be one of the side bitches.
Yeah,

133
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,700
I think there were about trying to.
Oh yeah.

134
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,510
Probably his fight team or something 
probably.

135
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:24,863
Oh

136
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,163
yeah,
that's what I was saying at the time of 

137
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,030
that fight a goal.
No,

138
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,893
let's go.
No,

139
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,913
no,
no,

140
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:45,320
no.
I like to relax.

141
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,330
He's biting over here.
Oh yeah,

142
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,750
I know that guy.
It's like,

143
00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:53,090
what?
It's probably seriously a good idea.

144
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,500
It man.
You got to take your dress off,

145
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,080
take your heels off.
He foughT john fitch.

146
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,610
I don't.
I do not think he won.

147
00:08:02,611 --> 00:08:06,090
I think he got beat down super long 
winning streak right around the.

148
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,110
Yup.
I think that was before john gsp for the

149
00:08:10,111 --> 00:08:13,410
title.
I think he tied the record for most wins

150
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:14,700
and they had to give him a title shot 
and like,

151
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,150
oh,
we got.

152
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:15,983
That's ridiculous.
He's happy when he's fighting on that 

153
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:17,544
card.
Is it john fitch came across this other 

154
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:21,490
entrance.
Oh,

155
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,513
did a wonder what year this was?
Trying to remember when the ufc brought 

156
00:08:28,201 --> 00:08:32,180
back 155 pound title because for a long 
time 1:17

157
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:33,014
was the lightest weight you could fly.
You got to give the student credit for 

158
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:36,870
his entrance is a lot of thought put 
into this.

159
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,023
He obviously does a lot of work behind 
me and miller had a great one and once 

160
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,500
he had like a bunch of dancers behind 
him and shit.

161
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,960
He had a whole choreographed entrance 
when he fought in pride.

162
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,500
Yeah,
I liked that,

163
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,380
but he always had ridiculous entrances.
I dunno.

164
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,710
What was that with his ski mask and what
was that?

165
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:55,983
Anybody stealing money?
Anybody who ever questioned whether or 

166
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,780
not mayhem was a good fighter because 
you know,

167
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,620
may have had some hard times and getting
a little nutty lately.

168
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,513
Yeah.
But if yOu go back to one mayhem fought 

169
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,620
sakharov No,
not soccer.

170
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,180
Soccer.
Raba in pride.

171
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,040
Dude.
He smashed sakharova.

172
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,903
Smashed it,
went right through them and submitted 

173
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:16,704
them.
Really?

174
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,090
Woo.
Yeah,

175
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,770
pull it up jimmy.
See if you can find it.

176
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:24,771
It's a this qualification mayhem in the 
ufc or what?

177
00:09:24,851 --> 00:09:27,660
Pride and pride.
Did he lose one by disqualification?

178
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:29,820
Boy,
I don't remember that diddy.

179
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,290
I don't know.
I didn't see it.

180
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,210
It was like on this road,
this is his dream and oh,

181
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,490
this was dream.
This wasn't the pride.

182
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,100
That's great.
Schoolgirl outfit.

183
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,750
Come on.
How do you not love this?

184
00:09:41,751 --> 00:09:42,840
It's awesoMe.

185
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,410
No ma'am.
He's had some tough tImes,

186
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,260
but he's always been cool to me.
I like that guy.

187
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,173
I see him.
He comes out to my shows when I do 

188
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,040
urban.
He's a good man.

189
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,090
He's a great guy.
I mean,

190
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:56,550
he's got some problems and you know,
he was always,

191
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,030
he was always a extraordinarily nutty 
dude.

192
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,080
You know,
he did the mtv show for awhIle,

193
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,123
by the way.
I ended up binge watching that one day 

194
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:05,940
and watching dudes.
Fuck,

195
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,700
I don't know how to fight.
You know what?

196
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,610
I remember one time when we were in 
Australia for fights years ago,

197
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,480
a rampage was there and I guess those 
two are good friends.

198
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,333
So I was going from like different areas
in like this mini group with rampage 

199
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,024
patient.
Every time somebody wanted a picture 

200
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:28,104
with him,
they put their arm around his shoulder 

201
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,310
at any time he would throw their arm 
off,

202
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,420
get your fucking arm off and were like,
okay.

203
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,810
Then they'd Be like scared for their 
picture.

204
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:40,290
Like,
huh?

205
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,370
Like that.
So get your fucking horrible.

206
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,720
That was rapid.
It was rampant.

207
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,820
People pinch my nipples and pictures 
with me pages and so I'm sitting like,

208
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,410
so

209
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,243
witnessed that like 10 times.
And then we moved to some bar somewhere 

210
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,970
and it's a,
you know,

211
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,013
there's like,
I don't know if it's like roped off 

212
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:01,660
people over here.
There's a lot of people in the place,

213
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:06,661
but it's like a small group like this 
and brand pages here and mayhem comes up

214
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,733
and I don't know that they know each.
I don't know the relationship and he 

215
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,100
immediately grabs him by the throat 
like,

216
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,060
I'm gonna fucking kill you.
But the for the,

217
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,133
for a split second,
I saw all this just split like violence 

218
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:22,444
come into random eyes.
Like he was about to fucking murder 

219
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,130
someone and then I saw it disappear.
He saw him.

220
00:11:27,131 --> 00:11:27,964
He was like crazy as well,

221
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,103
but like for a quick second,
he turned like just to break them in 

222
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:32,994
half and I was like,
that was more terrifying than any fight 

223
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:36,180
I'd

224
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,220
seen.
Rampage is a beast.

225
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,880
Yeah,
shoulders.

226
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:44,250
That head is too.
He hits so hard.

227
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,110
Rampage had some epic fights in prior to
before we ever even came to the ufc.

228
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:54,100
He has the all time,
greatest slam knockout of all time,

229
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,933
greatest in the triangle and the 
triangle smashes them down to the 

230
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:00,460
ground.
What the fuck was the guy's name?

231
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,610
But he fought very good.
A raMpage was in a triangle.

232
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:08,380
Ricardo arona stood up.
He still had his legs around him.

233
00:12:08,381 --> 00:12:11,740
He just picked him up and then.
Yeah,

234
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,190
this is like,
yeah,

235
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:18,191
this is the dude went for the triangle,
but he was elevated and like watch,

236
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:19,414
go find the video.
In the video he went for the triangle 

237
00:12:23,231 --> 00:12:27,130
and rampage elevated like he lifted him 
up and the dude held onto the triangle,

238
00:12:27,131 --> 00:12:27,964
which you just can't do.
You gotta you gotta let it go at this 

239
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:31,240
point.
See what he's up like that you gotta let

240
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:32,074
go of the slam.
Greatest slam kale ever in the history 

241
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:38,200
of sport.
And he had him look at this.

242
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:43,230
It's like a pillow glam to it looks like
he headbutted his face.

243
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,560
He did and he actually got his eyebrow 
cut.

244
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,980
I mean this dude was dead on the way 
down.

245
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:51,970
Watch.
Let go right there.

246
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,940
Yeah.
I mean he just got fucking k.

247
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:58,611
Oh,
did,

248
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,070
did,
did,

249
00:12:59,070 --> 00:12:59,471
did,
did.

250
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:02,470
They did.
This is the worst time I've ever seen in

251
00:13:02,471 --> 00:13:04,630
my life at all.
My years of watching fights.

252
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,160
Yeah.
I've never seen.

253
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,980
Never seen anything more brutal,
man.

254
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:10,410
I would love to see him do that.
The bird,

255
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,840
like just.
I'm just to see it just to say it.

256
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,700
Yeah.
I can't take that kind of impact,

257
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:16,370
man.
No,

258
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,110
no,
no.

259
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,850
I was never the same.
no more tickets.

260
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:23,851
Man was never the same after.
Ella never run.

261
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,010
It wasn't like a serious contender 
before that fight.

262
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,190
They'd send me once in the,
uh,

263
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:28,900
in that,
in that gym that was downtown.

264
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:32,110
They have a little article on one of the
teacher companies the tap out place.

265
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,650
the oNe that anderson's manager.
Oh yay.

266
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,920
Black house.
Yeah.

267
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,360
And he was like,
I'm going to slam.

268
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,450
Looks like a light one was out for a 
long time.

269
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,430
You were knocked ouT.
I mean,

270
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:43,840
like I couldn't move.
Right?

271
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,310
Oh really?
Pick you up.

272
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,260
He just,
he's just a light.

273
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,221
Like,
yeah,

274
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:50,740
you got to learn how to fall before you 
do that.

275
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,030
I don't know.
I like not having not to.

276
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,130
You got to kind of,
as you going back,

277
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:54,964
you kind of like relax and kind of slap 
the mat to dissipate some of the energy 

278
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:01,960
for everyone's judo guys that role.
And as they roll them back,

279
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:04,480
they slap the mat.
It's like a big loud as shit.

280
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,733
Yeah,
it literally helps relieve some of the 

281
00:14:08,141 --> 00:14:11,650
energy of you hitting the ground because
also like relaxing,

282
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,583
knowing how to roll.
Did iT save my ass when I crashed a 

283
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:16,660
bike?
I was doing this scene,

284
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,503
this Kevin James movie.
I haven't ridden a bike since I was a 

285
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:19,714
kid.

286
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:20,683
I don't know how to ride bikes anymore 
and in this scene me and Kevin James 

287
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,810
chasing each other and I have to.
I'm whipping him with this,

288
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,183
this antenna or something like that got 
flagged and as I'm hitting them with 

289
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,050
this stick with the flag,
I hit the brakes,

290
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:34,120
I hit the front brake.
It's my left hand.

291
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:37,800
I go over the top.
I totally did.

292
00:14:37,801 --> 00:14:39,340
I did it like three times.
I,

293
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:44,310
there's a,
yeah,

294
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,350
it was such a dick move and kevin and I 
have known each other since we were like

295
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,450
super early 20 so it was like really 
fun.

296
00:14:49,451 --> 00:14:51,490
Silly.
Like

297
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,623
kevin likes shit like that.
Like will you slip like you don't get 

298
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:56,961
good on the bike.
Anyway,

299
00:14:56,961 --> 00:14:59,900
I crashed hardcore.
There's like there's like a loop real.

300
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:00,734
If you could see me flying off the bike.
It was supposed to have a crest on the 

301
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,220
front break.
Yay.

302
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:07,480
If you press it,
the front brake,

303
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,790
he's supposed to break with the rear.
not supposed to break with the front,

304
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:11,624
but I'm holding the handle bar with my 
left side and I'm hitting him like this 

305
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,940
and I just hit that fucking thing.
Go over the top.

306
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:18,710
But then you brace yourself for the 
fall.

307
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,530
But because I'm,
you know,

308
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,540
used to grappling and rolling around a 
lot.

309
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:26,450
I was fine.
Just I just wiped out one time.

310
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:29,300
We went all the way over and I had to 
catch myself on my hands.

311
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,490
I went over the top.
I was Like,

312
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,990
ooh,
this one might break some shit.

313
00:15:32,991 --> 00:15:36,770
So you kept falling time.
Fucking times men.

314
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,480
Yeah,
it felt like three times.

315
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,470
Oh my god.
That was the bad one show.

316
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,690
Yeah.
You come right up a pavement.

317
00:15:50,691 --> 00:15:53,100
Shit man.
Yeah,

318
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,070
dude.
As a couple of them,

319
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,460
that was the only one.
One of them I went in,

320
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,110
I flew off to the left and rolled in 
this grass hillside.

321
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:07,040
I like wiped hard.
That wasn't what they wanted to abuse in

322
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,920
in the movie because they were going to.
Yeah.

323
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:09,763
Instead of having a stunt guy,
they had a stunt guy push in and he was 

324
00:16:11,961 --> 00:16:12,794
going to fly over the handlebars,
but I just fucked it up in my head 

325
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,390
going,
how am I going to fucking stop?

326
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,460
That stunk.
I was bad ass.

327
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:21,070
Actually.
He did a scene with a.

328
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,033
He took one of those bikes.
He actually knew how to ride and he 

329
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:27,380
jumped and entire flight of stairs.
That leads down to the boston common.

330
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:30,370
They set up a ramp and this dude comes 
whipping around the corner under.

331
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,620
Those are nuts,
man.

332
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,510
God damn crazy.
Fuck up there.

333
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:37,050
You're breaking shit.
Yeah.

334
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,290
Like you're going to break break shit 
regularly,

335
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,124
man.
their whole bodies that just crushed 

336
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,140
dude.
I gotta break some shit.

337
00:16:42,141 --> 00:16:44,100
I was going like three miles an hour or 
something.

338
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,910
If you're flying.
There's another one.

339
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,500
See I'm trying to.
Oh,

340
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:55,760
you're really doing that.
Really beaten him.

341
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,740
But that's the one that I Did and 
nothing happened.

342
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,250
what happened?
But um,

343
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,940
yeah man.
Fuck all that.

344
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,730
Those guys are crazy.
Yeah.

345
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,960
No,
I don't want any part of that,

346
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,050
those mountain bike dudes that do those.
You ever seen those videos?

347
00:17:12,051 --> 00:17:15,740
They put on a gopro on their helmet and 
where the fuck out there on the tip of a

348
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:19,290
mountain and there's death to the right 
depth to the left.

349
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,740
Oh yeah.
Oh my gosh.

350
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,390
So many.
Did you get your thrill from that?

351
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,340
What the fuck?
Just watching it.

352
00:17:25,341 --> 00:17:27,980
I get fucking excited.
I mean I Love to do that shit.

353
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,260
Bombing the hill on a skateboard.
You ever done that?

354
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,960
Go straight down.
Just when I was nominated.

355
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,180
I've done it recently.
There was a moment where you're like out

356
00:17:38,181 --> 00:17:39,760
of control.
This is stop.

357
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,913
Stop it.
It's called thrill hill right by my 

358
00:17:42,201 --> 00:17:43,190
house.
So I have a,

359
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,053
I have a um,
a stick I paddleboard and nobody's 

360
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:48,920
called thrill hill is what's,

361
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,410
how do you slow yourself down on a 
skateboard?

362
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,340
Jump off it and run longboard no,
no.

363
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,183
This is all my short board during our 
regular skateboard because I liked the 

364
00:17:58,051 --> 00:17:58,884
wheels better.
So I have my stick and I'm with the 

365
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:01,890
girls were riding back from a party and 
I go,

366
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:02,910
hey,
let's bomb through hill.

367
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,170
And they're like,
okay,

368
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,520
it's an open street.
Uh,

369
00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:06,750
yeah,
it's right by their school.

370
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:09,180
And so it's back.
It's back.

371
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,590
It's like,
you know what,

372
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:13,140
if I'm not going this fast,
yeah,

373
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:16,240
this is alright.
How do you slow it down out?

374
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,630
We didn't.
How do you slow one of these things down

375
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:23,080
and push these guys do it sideways.
They go sideways when you do a,

376
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:27,570
I jump off and start running.
Or in this case I keep going too fast.

377
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,000
That's what happened to me.
And I.

378
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:30,883
Did you eat shit?

379
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,880
Uh,
I went for lying.

380
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,030
I was dragging my because I didn't 
realize how big,

381
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,650
how steep it was because it's not this 
deep.

382
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,390
Oh my god.
But it's still sleeps.

383
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,100
It's still steep enough where.
Wait,

384
00:18:41,101 --> 00:18:42,330
hold on one second.
You know,

385
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:46,410
they do this on open roads,
like when cars are driving on the roads,

386
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,400
this kid is a wizard right here.
This kid is a wizard,

387
00:18:49,401 --> 00:18:51,600
has got gloves that.
But listening or watching,

388
00:18:51,601 --> 00:18:56,070
this guy was wiz down this hill,
a masterfully on a skateboard.

389
00:18:56,071 --> 00:18:58,330
What's his name got blocks in is what 
does it say?

390
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:03,550
What does this shows trucks.
So cal downhill longboarding fucking.

391
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,710
Hey,
this guy's a wizard.

392
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,150
Yeah,
that looks awesome.

393
00:19:06,151 --> 00:19:08,920
But one of the reasons why looks sharp.
Solar rays,

394
00:19:08,921 --> 00:19:10,830
his name sean woolery,
powerful sean,

395
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,713
Missouri.
One of the reasons why it's so awesome 

396
00:19:12,871 --> 00:19:14,700
is because the consequences of fucking 
up.

397
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,080
So there's a split second where you're 
going with.

398
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,953
and by the way,
this hill is nothing but your girls did 

399
00:19:19,771 --> 00:19:21,750
this on their bikes.
Totally do.

400
00:19:21,751 --> 00:19:22,584
I totally put on a skateboard.
I just assumed I do it on the bike all 

401
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:27,504
the time and it's not that aggressive.
And I start going down this hill and I 

402
00:19:29,671 --> 00:19:31,650
start picking up speed and I realized,
oh I,

403
00:19:31,651 --> 00:19:34,080
I just signed a contract that I can't 
renegotiate.

404
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,390
I'm going to.
And I might stick with me.

405
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:41,150
I start dragging my stick and I'm just 
reading this stick and I'm.

406
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,270
And then I'm like,
oh my god,

407
00:19:42,271 --> 00:19:44,070
I've got to fucking cause.
By the way,

408
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,600
when I do it,
I usually go ahead of them and check the

409
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,450
car,
the cross street to make sure there's no

410
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:49,800
cars,
but I'm like,

411
00:19:49,801 --> 00:19:51,180
oh fuck,
I didn't think this through.

412
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,230
So I jumped off and ran,
blew out a flip flop,

413
00:19:55,290 --> 00:20:00,010
ran out,
no shirt.

414
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,350
No,
it's great.

415
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,580
This fucking lit myself up.
Oh my god.

416
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,290
Flip flop,
busted one.

417
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,270
I bought a glue out the toe of a flip 
flop,

418
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,583
but luckily they got six pairs of flip 
flops because I love him so much and 

419
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:16,000
they just ran out of it.
I ran out of blue out a.

420
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:16,620
Yeah,
what?

421
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,460
Barefoot.
And I was like,

422
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,540
oh.
And by the way,

423
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,820
the rest of the.
Obviously the rest of the trip home,

424
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,330
one flip flop sticks.
Reddit is obviously all uphill,

425
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,680
so I'm just like,
fucking why did I think you know,

426
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,460
when you're a kid you do that.
I did much steeper as a kid,

427
00:20:32,461 --> 00:20:34,950
but it's just,
you didn't think it through,

428
00:20:34,951 --> 00:20:35,784
man.
The problem is that the risk is so 

429
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:41,910
fucking monumental.
The risk is like end of,

430
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,890
oh,

431
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,940
where did you get his trailer?
He gets off perfectly.

432
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,890
Yeah,
that's what you have to jump off and run

433
00:20:52,891 --> 00:20:55,890
off it.
God damn,

434
00:20:55,891 --> 00:20:56,724
that was nasty.
You when you get out of control like 

435
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,740
bottles too.
She got wiped.

436
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,950
The only thing worse than only thing.
Worse than speed wobbles.

437
00:21:04,951 --> 00:21:07,530
His whiskey throttle.
Like when it comes to speed,

438
00:21:07,531 --> 00:21:08,550
you know,
whiskey throttled list,

439
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,070
whiskey throttles when you punch it and 
you get scared and your natural reaction

440
00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:16,820
is to hold it punched.
That's your natural reaction.

441
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,900
I get that.
I do that all the time.

442
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,210
We get you want to like punch it and 
break,

443
00:21:21,211 --> 00:21:21,811
but there's just like,
wait,

444
00:21:21,811 --> 00:21:23,550
what am I pressing on?
and you jusT going faster.

445
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,120
Yeah.
You're like,

446
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,770
why am I stopping not stopping.
I'm going like,

447
00:21:25,771 --> 00:21:26,610
we have this,
we did this.

448
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,390
We took snowmobiles into a lake one time
and we this guy nacho.

449
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:34,920
And he was the first guy to do it and 
all they're saying is when you turn lean

450
00:21:34,921 --> 00:21:36,930
a certain way and then you'll go the 
other way.

451
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:37,870
And so,
okay,

452
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,060
we've,
none of us have done this.

453
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,283
They're like,
but you got to keep it fast and he 

454
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,083
punches it on the lake and whiskey 
throttles it all the way across the 

455
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:46,590
lake,
into a fucking tree.

456
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:50,380
Dislocates his shoulder.
This is the guy showing you good.

457
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:56,830
This is the guy who's taking on a trip 
of a lifetime trip flip dislocates.

458
00:21:57,281 --> 00:21:59,320
his shoulder was our first activity

459
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,610
and he was like,
I couldn't let go.

460
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:03,980
I don't like.
It's a whiskey bottle.

461
00:22:03,981 --> 00:22:06,660
It's like more like a mental panic panic

462
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,263
with cars too.
They say they think they're hitting the 

463
00:22:09,111 --> 00:22:09,944
gas or the brake rather than the gas,
like eddie griffin and then that 

464
00:22:12,471 --> 00:22:14,180
ferrari,
but he just didn't know how to drive.

465
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,100
That was a million dollar car.
Yeah,

466
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:16,934
it was like a,
like a ferrari or ends over toes and 

467
00:22:18,681 --> 00:22:23,080
enzo took it right out and smashed it 
into a wall in a private club.

468
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:23,914
CloSed.
I did not know how to drive it at all 

469
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,341
and they got out.
I was like,

470
00:22:28,341 --> 00:22:31,370
fuck man.
wasn't good.

471
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,080
No speed wobbles in East Timor.
Going down a highway and like a big,

472
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:38,390
a really bad road for awhile and then I 
got some good road.

473
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:39,290
I was like,
oh yeah,

474
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,183
I'm going to crank this.
And someone like a moped probably 80 

475
00:22:44,751 --> 00:22:46,020
kilometers an hour.
Oh,

476
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,280
that's pretty fast.
Yeah.

477
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,193
Yeah.
And then hitting a bump and another one 

478
00:22:49,641 --> 00:22:50,370
and the garment.
Fuck,

479
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,890
fuck them down.
And then it was just like,

480
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,770
I don't know how I managed to save it,
but it was like that lady.

481
00:22:54,771 --> 00:22:57,350
When you start the heavy wobbles,
but you gotta control your,

482
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,250
you overcompensate every shift in until 
you're done.

483
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,083
Done.

484
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,390
Yep.
I've,

485
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,220
I've,
uh,

486
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,053
I think it always think motorcycle 
riding motorcycles is so much fucking 

487
00:23:08,651 --> 00:23:12,460
fun because it really allows you to feel
truly vulnerable.

488
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,420
Like I go in 70 miles per hour on the 
interstate in a fucking motorcycle is.

489
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:20,290
There's no sensation.
I mean there's no comparable sensation.

490
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,640
Like you can stick your hand out a 
window,

491
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:22,474
but it's nothing compared to like 
fucking flying car flies by you and 

492
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:26,640
you're like,
ah,

493
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,930
I'd erase thunderstorm home,
uh,

494
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:30,480
in,
in,

495
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,020
at home.
But where we were staying,

496
00:23:32,021 --> 00:23:35,470
I had to race a thunderstorm so we get 
there and lightening start striking like

497
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,120
10 miles away from us.
And they were like,

498
00:23:37,121 --> 00:23:38,710
we should probably go,
this is coming on quick.

499
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,813
And so we're flying,
trying to race a thunderstorm home 

500
00:23:41,771 --> 00:23:42,400
through,
uh,

501
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,280
through crow nation.
And I think in Montana,

502
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,830
dude.
Fucking flying down to open it up there,

503
00:23:48,831 --> 00:23:50,540
man.
Oh,

504
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,040
it was,
it was pretty.

505
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:55,010
Uh,
I wish I could ride a motorcycle.

506
00:23:55,011 --> 00:23:55,844
I liked that.
I would love to do that on sunday 

507
00:23:56,481 --> 00:23:58,550
mornings I think.
Yeah,

508
00:23:58,551 --> 00:24:01,580
like a harley.
You have away mountain road somewhere.

509
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,350
People drive slow.
Not here.

510
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,640
Like go and do it here,
man.

511
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,450
Lonzo bowden rides motorcycle 
everywhere.

512
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,730
He's a bad motherfucker.
He's weaving between cars.

513
00:24:10,731 --> 00:24:12,550
Like thoSe guys set a ride.
he knows how to ride.

514
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,700
He said a few of them.
Yeah.

515
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,760
Yeah.
He Sent one of those honda vtech things.

516
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:19,670
I think that's what it was called.
He has that bmw,

517
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,430
like all world,
all terrain bike now.

518
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,890
Like the ones that you see people 
really?

519
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,590
Yeah,
like a crazy bmw motorcycle.

520
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,350
They do like the,
the have a competition,

521
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:33,650
whatever the top competition is for 
those guys off road.

522
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:34,670
I think he has that bike.

523
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,000
He used to have this bike,
alonzo's garage baffle.

524
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,220
Lonza bowden.
it's got a bunch of motorcycles.

525
00:24:40,221 --> 00:24:45,221
No kids balling.
Keeps it all legit rides tracks.

526
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,140
Yeah.
Well he had this,

527
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:49,910
uh,
he's got a bunch of trIumphs and shit,

528
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,550
but he had this thing that might be a 
few years back.

529
00:24:52,551 --> 00:24:53,384
That was a yamaha,
I think it was called the v max and it 

530
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:58,124
was this big giant cruiser thing.
See if you could find that because this 

531
00:25:02,331 --> 00:25:05,930
crazy motorcycle that he had,
it's like this stupid,

532
00:25:05,931 --> 00:25:07,520
powerful,
really big.

533
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,290
Is it honda v dot?
No,

534
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:10,370
not honda.
Yamaha.

535
00:25:10,371 --> 00:25:12,200
V max.
I think I know you're talking about.

536
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:15,440
I think doc from the date and funny bone
had one.

537
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,830
I might've been,
I might've even saying the name wrong.

538
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,600
Is that the right name?
Bowden?

539
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:21,950
Yeah.
No,

540
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,813
that's telling the boden,
but I mean no fucking motorcycle was 

541
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,260
just,
I don't know shit about motorcycles.

542
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,180
Like if it was a car I'd be able to 
remember.

543
00:25:35,181 --> 00:25:36,260
It is.
It is.

544
00:25:36,261 --> 00:25:37,930
It is.
It a yamaha,

545
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,220
something like that.
It's some jApanese bike,

546
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:41,054
but it was a giant cruiser and it had 
this enormous engine is fucking thing 

547
00:25:44,121 --> 00:25:44,954
was huge.
It was really wide and alonzo had one 

548
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,720
and I was like,
whoa dude,

549
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,820
you're driving some tron machine.
That's a scary,

550
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,540
a twitch muscle in your brain to allow 
like I know you.

551
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:57,620
What's your car,
tommy?

552
00:25:57,621 --> 00:26:01,500
That porsche thing,
like we just got a,

553
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:05,270
just a bmw the other day.
Just a fine model.

554
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,750
Five 45,
47 series.

555
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,510
Not like a tricked out one.
Not a sport edition,

556
00:26:11,511 --> 00:26:15,070
just like a sedan,
but it's fast as fucking shit dude.

557
00:26:15,071 --> 00:26:17,330
The regular bmw is like a regular three 
series.

558
00:26:17,331 --> 00:26:22,331
Bmw is a better handling sports car than
anything of like 30 years ago for sure.

559
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,713
By far.
So regular one without any 

560
00:26:25,371 --> 00:26:27,410
modifications.
Stock dude.

561
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:32,411
I find myself putting it in sport mode 
and fucking following and going like.

562
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,100
And you told me you were like,
you have no idea.

563
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:37,610
I got from oxnard to la and 30 minutes 
really fly man.

564
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,781
That's it.
That's it.

565
00:26:38,781 --> 00:26:40,880
That's it.
what is that thing called flow?

566
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,710
The thing is so big,
it's hard.

567
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,593
Does it say it's.
You've got to find out what the fuck 

568
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:47,454
that thing is called because there's a.
There's an overhead of them that's even 

569
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:52,530
more preposterous.
What do you mean overhead?

570
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,200
The overhead view.
The thing is like this wide,

571
00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:00,210
like I'm not exaggerating.
It's like literally wider than my body.

572
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,460
The side of the motorcycle.
That's enormous.

573
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,323
That looks nuts.
It's essentially like this enormous 

574
00:27:06,301 --> 00:27:07,134
engine on this super wide heavy cruising
motorcycle that just has stupendous 

575
00:27:11,461 --> 00:27:13,920
power.
I drove one of those indian,

576
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:18,270
a indian judges,
not judge indian chiefs.

577
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,630
The big fucking bags and the steering 
wheel's out here.

578
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,230
I was flying through the talladega 
national forest.

579
00:27:25,231 --> 00:27:27,390
Just the beginning of all of them 
listening to lynyrd skynyrd,

580
00:27:27,391 --> 00:27:29,550
all my headset's just going,
man.

581
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:30,384
Where's the whiskey?
A little bit of a buzz and doing that 

582
00:27:33,571 --> 00:27:34,404
would be perfect.
If you could trust everybody to keep 

583
00:27:36,331 --> 00:27:37,780
their shit together,
it would be awesome.

584
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,330
Ride a motorcycle,
but you can't.

585
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,130
Is that?
It is.

586
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,890
Not it.
That's not the same bike.

587
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,870
You see the pipes are different.
That's it.

588
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:48,510
See how it has these massive pipes.
See that thing,

589
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:52,500
that thing is gigantic and it's a huge 
three cylinder engine.

590
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,510
By the way,
those things get fucking hot.

591
00:27:54,511 --> 00:27:57,360
A shit because you have an engine in 
between your legs.

592
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,393
Time.
I drove to burns first time I rode when 

593
00:28:00,661 --> 00:28:01,620
I was like,
I think it's on.

594
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,513
I think I'm.
I'm don't have something unlocked 

595
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:04,320
because it's hottest fucking.

596
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,220
That's the bike rack it three.
Is that it?

597
00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:09,420
Yeah.
800 plus pound.

598
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,570
Super heavyweight to triumph rocket 
three.

599
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,630
Oh,
is that it?

600
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,010
So that's not the same one as the other 
one or is it?

601
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,170
No,
that's different.

602
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,220
That's different.
That's the honda or yamaha?

603
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,490
It says child does it.
Let's solid top.

604
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:21,051
Right.
You're right.

605
00:28:21,051 --> 00:28:22,620
It does.
All right.

606
00:28:22,621 --> 00:28:26,940
I'm wrong because another one.
See if you can google honda v.

607
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,630
Max told me to text because now I'm 
alone.

608
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,181
Yeah,
text.

609
00:28:30,181 --> 00:28:32,000
Alonzo looks.
He looks.

610
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,160
He looks different.
Is that it?

611
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,440
Let me give to give me an image on that 
thing.

612
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,530
Was that it?
Yamaha.

613
00:28:40,531 --> 00:28:42,600
V max.
I think that's it.

614
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,830
That's pretty wild,
man.

615
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,390
I'm so bad and I can Just call them real
quick.

616
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,350
We can find out right now.
I think,

617
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,210
yeah,
please do column because this is getting

618
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,193
boring for people just to try to figure 
out what the board of the odds that 

619
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:04,370
alonzo the same number from when I got 
it come up.

620
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:10,350
Be alonzo mourning sounds like a fair 
deal amongst those.

621
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,480
The worst voicemail message I've ever 
heard in my life.

622
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,930
How long it was bird.
I'm with joe.

623
00:29:15,931 --> 00:29:16,764
Joe has a question about the bike.
You have hay a lot until used to have 

624
00:29:19,141 --> 00:29:21,480
some crazy.
It was at a yamaha v max.

625
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:24,000
Am I correct?
Is that a crazy bike?

626
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:26,760
You had some.
You had some crazy large touring,

627
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:27,823
super powerful japanese bike or maybe my
memory's shit from all the years of 

628
00:29:30,841 --> 00:29:32,550
marijuana.
call us back.

629
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:38,290
It might've just been his dick in my 
bathroom.

630
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,730
Like tHat's a big motorcycle.
Motorcycle spirit and fire.

631
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,680
I could get into sports,
car shit.

632
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,790
Motorcycles.
I could.

633
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,680
Yeah,
I could get into these things for sure.

634
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,940
I rode a bicycle around.
I don't think I'm wrong within.

635
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,950
I think I'm conflating this with another
bike.

636
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,650
I think the other bike was it was it 
even crazier?

637
00:29:59,651 --> 00:30:00,484
Biked in this.
I think this town is terrifying to ride 

638
00:30:02,021 --> 00:30:04,510
those in the.
It was some big ass touring bike.

639
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,740
I think everybody who drives member and 
it was like,

640
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,650
it's just crazy with people,
especially with his weed,

641
00:30:08,651 --> 00:30:09,484
smoking in cars,
people like they'll just cut you off a 

642
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,900
fucking and all.
They see people doing this.

643
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,930
Oh yeah.
I constantly see people staring at their

644
00:30:16,931 --> 00:30:17,890
phone.
When you're on a bike,

645
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:20,320
you see it more clear.
You have no idea.

646
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:24,370
You see like fucking three things ahead 
of you going like,

647
00:30:24,371 --> 00:30:26,290
this motherfucker's not looking.
They're not looking.

648
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,360
God dammit.
They're going to pull out.

649
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:27,940
Yeah,
it is.

650
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,870
It is.
And I think,

651
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:29,710
and um,
I'll say this,

652
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,040
I'm a very limited motorcycle driver,
rider obviously,

653
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,263
but like I think that's what makes it 
enjoyable because you're truly in the 

654
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:37,650
moment,
you,

655
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:39,250
you,
you're forced to live in the moment.

656
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:41,480
You don't think about bills are more.
Yeah,

657
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,620
like fucking percentage deals.
You're like fucking.

658
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:47,770
And that's why I want one.
I want to take it up through the canyons

659
00:30:47,771 --> 00:30:51,700
out to malibu,
malibu to the ne neptune's nest.

660
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,653
And then taking home.
I'm like a sunday morning when 

661
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:58,920
everyone's asleep except the drunks that
are just coming home on adderall co dot.

662
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,810
You know what else?
Shit decision your phone,

663
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,060
you're going to feel that clarity.
Ninety days sober,

664
00:31:04,061 --> 00:31:05,170
which we got to come on up.
Let's.

665
00:31:05,171 --> 00:31:07,630
Well,
let's talk about this shit already.

666
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:08,464
Please.
cat crack that nut to crack a joke and 

667
00:31:11,321 --> 00:31:12,220
we make you a cocktail.

668
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,840
sure.
Most certainly.

669
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,690
I would like to hear what you fellows 
have been thinking.

670
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,201
Oh,
well,

671
00:31:17,201 --> 00:31:18,034
we've had a lot of big ideas.
I think some of us were speaking big 

672
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:24,901
when the,
that's a quote easy.

673
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,830
She said,
well,

674
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,810
it's the longest you've ever gone 
without drinking hours.

675
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,280
Well,
I,

676
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,010
I did,
I did,

677
00:31:33,011 --> 00:31:33,844
uh,
uh,

678
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,020
13 years.
One time.

679
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,480
what was probably the longest I've ever 
done six months when I went,

680
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,100
when I met leanne,
why did you go six months?

681
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,020
Because I wanted to,
if I could do it.

682
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,303
And uh,
I did six months and then we were in 

683
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:55,390
Italy and it was snowing and venice and 
we were having dinner and I said,

684
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:56,740
this is fucking stupid.
I want to,

685
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,910
I want to have a cocktail.
I want to,

686
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:58,900
I want carpet.
Damn.

687
00:31:58,901 --> 00:32:01,450
I want to be impulsive right now.
And so I.

688
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,910
Leanne looked at me and she's like,
you don't have a drinking problem.

689
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,670
Just have some wine and let's go walk 
around.

690
00:32:05,671 --> 00:32:10,671
St regret staying back moment.
Do you want his scotch and soda?

691
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,250
I'll have scotch.
There you go.

692
00:32:12,251 --> 00:32:13,061
Here.
Let's take this one.

693
00:32:13,061 --> 00:32:14,230
All right.
Um,

694
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,380
we use an ice.
Do you drink it with ice or not?

695
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:17,681
Oh,
look at you.

696
00:32:17,681 --> 00:32:20,200
You fucking Russell Peters.
Travel.

697
00:32:20,201 --> 00:32:21,034
That's it.
No,

698
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:25,820
that's an idiot.
It looked like scotch.

699
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:27,400
I said for a second.
It looked like it.

700
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,353
Dude.
I might be making up a fucking crazy 

701
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,820
motorcycle in my head.
I don't think I am though.

702
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,640
I think there was some weird cruising 
motorcycle that alonzo had.

703
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,040
Dammit.
It's driving me

704
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,480
fucking nuts.
But yeah,

705
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,130
I,
I,

706
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:44,390
I did six months and then I started 
drinking again.

707
00:32:44,391 --> 00:32:45,224
It's,
I think it's good to reset your clock 

708
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:51,140
the last six months.
It's like a reset button.

709
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:54,920
So that time you did six months.
Have you ever done anything comparable?

710
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:55,754
Sense?
Yeah,

711
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,350
I've done.
I do.

712
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,050
I can do like a 17,
17 day chunk,

713
00:33:00,051 --> 00:33:02,780
but then the road starts back up.
That's the most I can be off the road.

714
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,180
It's a visual on the road,
on the road.

715
00:33:05,181 --> 00:33:10,181
I got to be dead honest With you.
Like I remember tom being likes jogging.

716
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:16,130
It's got to be totally honest talking 
about being habitual.

717
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,410
Um,
so,

718
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,720
uh,
I remember tom one time,

719
00:33:20,721 --> 00:33:21,231
I was like,
yeah,

720
00:33:21,231 --> 00:33:23,600
I went out with the staff and he's like,
do you drink every night on the road?

721
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:24,111
And I was like,
yeaH,

722
00:33:24,111 --> 00:33:24,931
what do you do?
And he was like,

723
00:33:24,931 --> 00:33:25,620
I go to bed.

724
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,630
Not that.
I was like,

725
00:33:26,631 --> 00:33:27,680
wait,
how do you do that?

726
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:28,843
Because it's really,
it is difficult for me to go back to a 

727
00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:34,790
hotel room on the road and just sit 
there and be like,

728
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:35,601
my night's done.
I'm done.

729
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:36,261
Thinking,
yeah,

730
00:33:36,261 --> 00:33:37,970
you know what man,
I'm going to like these.

731
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,790
I write,
I write on stage,

732
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,073
I'm tall.
I feel like you guys are all doing much 

733
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,200
bigger venues than me.
So I'm doing more shows.

734
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,990
I do not wanna hear myself fucking talk 
or think of anything.

735
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,920
That's a perfect time to show him your 
wife because that's the exact right time

736
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:52,850
for it.
If you were going to do that,

737
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,710
like you can just go over some

738
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,080
ideas in your head and it seems like 
once you get into it,

739
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,210
it's fun.
That's the thing about writing.

740
00:34:01,211 --> 00:34:02,044
This is a weird,
weird thing where writing kind of tries 

741
00:34:04,541 --> 00:34:05,374
to.
It's like your brain starts thinking of 

742
00:34:07,511 --> 00:34:08,344
it as this horrible task,
like you have to clean out a latrine or 

743
00:34:10,931 --> 00:34:12,850
something.
Your brain starts looking at it like,

744
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:14,590
oh my god,
I can't believe I have to do this,

745
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:17,860
but if you could just get past that once
you're actually writing.

746
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:18,723
It's really fun.
There's some weird psychological shit 

747
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:22,480
going on with resistance to writing.

748
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,290
hold on just how much.
Yeah,

749
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:26,960
I've written the argue.
Well,

750
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:27,251
no,
no,

751
00:34:27,251 --> 00:34:29,650
I mean just this idea I've written my 
next hour.

752
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,053
What I'm working on now is finding out,
so like my majority of writing I do now 

753
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,660
is how do I connect things that are 
good,

754
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,690
that don't have a connection and how do 
I like a.

755
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,613
How do I close the story?
I'm obsessing with how you end a good 

756
00:34:44,021 --> 00:34:44,854
story and so I'm working.
I'm not writing new material for the 

757
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:49,443
next hour.
I'm writing

758
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:52,150
is our.
You don't have to write anything,

759
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,433
but if you want to write,
you should just write like one of the 

760
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,273
beautiful things about writing is that 
if you don't have a guideline and you 

761
00:35:01,331 --> 00:35:04,990
just have an idea and you just let that 
idea starts spilling out of your head,

762
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:08,770
shit will come out that you didn't 
expect and that shit can become more.

763
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:12,010
But if you don't sit down and do that,
then it doesn't happen.

764
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:12,993
You'll have some things that'll happen.
Sometimes you'll have some things 

765
00:35:15,551 --> 00:35:16,384
that'll happen with friends.
There's some things that'll happen on 

766
00:35:18,021 --> 00:35:18,854
stage.
There's some things that'll happen with 

767
00:35:19,691 --> 00:35:20,524
the things that won't happen to the 
things that happen when you're sitting 

768
00:35:22,301 --> 00:35:23,134
in front of that computer because that 
is individual time focused only on the 

769
00:35:26,801 --> 00:35:30,460
idea.
Not thinking about killing with a crowd,

770
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,720
not thinking about,
you know,

771
00:35:31,721 --> 00:35:33,500
making sure that you know,
the,

772
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:34,363
you know,
the show closes well and ends with all 

773
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,273
the bullshit that goes on your head when
you're actually doing a bit or when you 

774
00:35:38,461 --> 00:35:42,000
actually performing a set,
when you sit there alone with a pad or a

775
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:43,350
computer or whatever the fuck you do to.

776
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,970
Right.
Or even if you just wanted,

777
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:50,040
like to do an a tape recorder,
you're thinking about all these ideas in

778
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:51,660
a way that you're not going to do any 
other way.

779
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:52,973
So if you don't do it,
I mean you can definitely get by not 

780
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:56,154
doing it.
I went by on not doing it for a long 

781
00:35:57,631 --> 00:35:58,464
time,
but there's a big difference in my act 

782
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,300
between when I do it and when I don't do
it.

783
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,353
But I mean I obviously I write because I
have a new hour that I'm taping in 

784
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:08,840
february so I do right.
Do right.

785
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,740
like to sit down.
I do not want.

786
00:36:10,741 --> 00:36:12,820
I wrote a book like that and it was 
taxing on me.

787
00:36:12,821 --> 00:36:13,654
Like when I wrote my book,
sitting down every day at the computer 

788
00:36:15,281 --> 00:36:19,030
and just typing out an idea,
what I do is I get on the treadmill,

789
00:36:19,031 --> 00:36:23,260
I have a pad on there and I will think 
through an a story or I'll think through

790
00:36:23,261 --> 00:36:27,520
a joke and then I'll and then I'll.
It's horrible to read and then I'll take

791
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:29,710
those beats and I'll move them over to 
my book and then I'll

792
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,790
well be in any way you're doing it is 
great.

793
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:32,683
I mean you don't have to do it in a way 
that you have to sit in front of a 

794
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:36,200
computer,
have to sit in front of a pat.

795
00:36:36,201 --> 00:36:37,310
I said,
if you want to record it,

796
00:36:37,311 --> 00:36:38,840
you can just record it by talking into 
it.

797
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:39,703
I'll never lose anything you're doing.
The idea is just working and thinking 

798
00:36:44,151 --> 00:36:47,300
about whatever you're doing and 
recording it the best way possible.

799
00:36:47,301 --> 00:36:48,134
For me,
the best way possible seems to be a 

800
00:36:49,401 --> 00:36:54,401
combination of having my phone right 
there with the notes feature on with the

801
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,990
voice,
a voice activated,

802
00:36:56,991 --> 00:36:58,790
a voice,
whatever it is.

803
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:00,470
DetectIng,
translating.

804
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,050
I have that nearby.
Just in case.

805
00:37:03,051 --> 00:37:04,670
A real quick,
when it comes into my head,

806
00:37:04,671 --> 00:37:07,700
I gotta get it down because my typing is
not the best.

807
00:37:07,701 --> 00:37:08,534
It's pretty good,
but I don't want to miss a beat of how 

808
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:12,104
I'm saying something.
So if I say something into a text or 

809
00:37:14,901 --> 00:37:18,320
maybe if it's like really important to 
say it with a certain tone,

810
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,300
I'll say it into the um,
the memo,

811
00:37:20,301 --> 00:37:23,390
the voice memo thing.
What's that?

812
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:24,893
When you're listening to right back was 
trying to work it into a chunk that you 

813
00:37:28,521 --> 00:37:29,550
do on stage.
Wow.

814
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:30,933
What I do in terms of like getting the 
segways or whatever is a try to do the 

815
00:37:34,631 --> 00:37:36,940
bits in different orders as much as I 
can.

816
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,910
And then you know,
instead of opening with the same thing,

817
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,003
what you're open with around and then 
you'll move to a different bit and then 

818
00:37:43,811 --> 00:37:44,644
also start pits halfway through and then
Just got a crew to shoot two shows in 

819
00:37:51,161 --> 00:37:53,070
denver.
And so on sunday nights.

820
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:53,904
So I recorded two different hours in 
denver for fruit for what I'm working 

821
00:37:57,641 --> 00:37:58,474
on.
And then I'll go through those and I'll 

822
00:37:59,201 --> 00:38:00,034
chunk the bits out.
And then I already chunk them out in my 

823
00:38:01,661 --> 00:38:02,494
head.
I think we all think probably very 

824
00:38:03,641 --> 00:38:04,361
differently.
I Think.

825
00:38:04,361 --> 00:38:05,194
I think more in my head,
I think I'm a little more obsessive 

826
00:38:07,391 --> 00:38:08,224
compulsive and I chew on ideas 
constantly and then I'll find a way to 

827
00:38:11,351 --> 00:38:12,580
link them.
Like today on the treadmill,

828
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:13,414
I thought I figured out a way to link 
this joke about my dad with his dream I 

829
00:38:16,391 --> 00:38:17,224
had.
cause I never liked telling jokes about 

830
00:38:18,461 --> 00:38:22,720
a dream I had said so in such a really 
did it really happen that thing.

831
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,000
But it's a funny.
It is a funny dream.

832
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,260
And,
and I was like.

833
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,780
And then on the treadmill I started 
figuring out and I hop off the treadmill

834
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,550
and I write it down on a piece of paper

835
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:35,000
that's writing man.
Now the time you're spending with us,

836
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,190
I just think about

837
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,410
something is writing.
Some people do it by walking.

838
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,573
I hear a locking.
People say they have some of the best 

839
00:38:40,841 --> 00:38:44,710
ideas.
They walk with stature on the treadmill.

840
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,080
I'm talking about like in the 
neighborhood.

841
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:46,651
Oh,
you know,

842
00:38:46,651 --> 00:38:47,484
I do.
I just do it.

843
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:48,903
I do it like at a four for like at least
30 minutes and just with that notepad 

844
00:38:51,681 --> 00:38:52,514
and I just write it down,
walking for something I learned in New 

845
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,440
York,
it would trigger the way I fall.

846
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,270
Changes your sites where you look at 
different things.

847
00:38:58,271 --> 00:39:00,430
So like a hardware store.
It's like you make your mind wandered or

848
00:39:00,431 --> 00:39:01,061
something.
Yeah,

849
00:39:01,061 --> 00:39:04,090
that's why I think they tried to get you
to go outside and do it.

850
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:04,924
Like go on a hike and then when you've 
done that a long time pop into your 

851
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:10,450
head.
Walking is great for clarity.

852
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,580
Like you think a lot of people though,
right?

853
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,670
Physically and then they'll think about 
what they wrote when they go on a walk.

854
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,730
Right.
You know,

855
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,613
I've walked a,
I had a really good writing session and 

856
00:39:18,751 --> 00:39:20,890
walking through it.
Target like just walking up and down the

857
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,733
aisles,
but you get to see people interact and 

858
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:26,614
you're allowed to mishear things.
When I mishear things that those are 

859
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:32,050
sometimes the funniest fucking things in
the world.

860
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,663
Well,
let's talk about what your current 

861
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:37,630
drinking statuses,
but like,

862
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,673
because to get into the approach,
can you recap like what an average week 

863
00:39:41,891 --> 00:39:42,700
is like?
Yeah,

864
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,533
yeah,
yeah,

865
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,230
yeah.
Okay.

866
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,550
First of all,
this isn't an intervention.

867
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:46,910
We're all friends.
Right?

868
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,433
Your friends though.
I was nervous about doing this for that 

869
00:39:51,551 --> 00:39:52,480
very reason.
I was thinking,

870
00:39:52,481 --> 00:39:53,314
okay,
did I suggest no booze for 90 days 

871
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:59,140
because I didn't think you could 
possibly do it.

872
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,130
Use adjusted,
adjusted?

873
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,280
Yes.
YeaH,

874
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,060
it was.

875
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,893
By the way,
I'll read the chat thread taxed because 

876
00:40:04,811 --> 00:40:07,720
it is funny and I will say already is 
the sea was the best.

877
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,460
Just read it.
I want to say.

878
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:12,850
Um,
how did it go down?

879
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:16,360
Did I say 90 days?
No.

880
00:40:16,361 --> 00:40:19,430
Booze plus America as a result of the 
marathon claim by the way,

881
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:21,550
to a marathon.
Yeah.

882
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,350
Well,
it's like you thought you're going to be

883
00:40:23,351 --> 00:40:25,360
able to do a marathon at the time it 
took the,

884
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,300
the you're getting the treadmill once in
a while.

885
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:31,600
You fucking idiot.
He thought he could do a marathon in the

886
00:40:31,601 --> 00:40:36,010
same time it took us to do a podcast.
We have like a three and a half hour and

887
00:40:36,011 --> 00:40:37,220
he thought it was going to do a 
marathon.

888
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,260
Run that shit.
Yes,

889
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:41,260
exactly.
Kenyan skinny dudes Who were just ripped

890
00:40:41,261 --> 00:40:44,770
to the fucking bone who'd been running 
every day flops.

891
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,693
Get off,
escape.

892
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,990
Such a bad idea.
Such stupid.

893
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:54,030
It's just so such a delusional 
perspective on physical fitness.

894
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:57,180
Here we go.
Like to run a five hour marathon.

895
00:40:57,181 --> 00:40:59,330
I'd be super impressed,
but who that could do that easy.

896
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,700
So you know,
hurt.

897
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,760
You can't run a marathon.
Easy.

898
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,540
You can't run a marathon.
Easy.

899
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:07,351
But you can.
I can.

900
00:41:07,351 --> 00:41:11,460
I tell you the one thing that you might 
be able to run a marathon.

901
00:41:11,461 --> 00:41:13,140
You can't run a marathon.
Easy.

902
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:16,140
Fifty five months.
Five hours is easy.

903
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,003
Okay.

904
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,960
I have a scale.
Let's put it back right now and how much

905
00:41:24,961 --> 00:41:25,794
I weigh.
Scale,

906
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,280
scale.
I know I weighed 222 pounds.

907
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,900
These are just numbers is my point,

908
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,800
but not as bad as he looked before.
Okay,

909
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,690
good.
You've got that compliment.

910
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:38,931
No,
no,

911
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:40,580
no,
but you've never run a marathon.

912
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:43,550
I've never run a marathon,
so you can't run a marathon easy because

913
00:41:43,551 --> 00:41:47,270
it's preposterous I've ever run.
When you're not looking at a tv like off

914
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,104
a treadmill.
I haven't done the street running a 

915
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:54,581
really long time talking fake running 
your fake running on a machine that does

916
00:41:55,521 --> 00:41:56,730
have to work for you.
It's there.

917
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,573
She comes towards you.
You just have the that I can tell you 

918
00:41:59,631 --> 00:42:04,580
exactly what would happen in a marathon.
You would hit mile.

919
00:42:04,581 --> 00:42:05,590
What do you think?
What do you think it goes?

920
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,463
Well,
here's the thing.

921
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,173
Yeah,
for.

922
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:12,200
It'd be right about the halfway point.
No way.

923
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:12,740
No,
no.

924
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,150
I think right around there he would go 
bad idea.

925
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:17,421
By the way,
by the way,

926
00:42:17,421 --> 00:42:18,030
by the way,
let's.

927
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:18,861
Let's,
let's do.

928
00:42:18,861 --> 00:42:20,530
Let's.
Let's double up on this double.

929
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:21,260
Let's.
Let's.

930
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:24,200
Let's figure out a drinking bet one.
Then let's figure out a marathon bet.

931
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,980
By the way,
I will.

932
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,433
I just texted with a guy the other day,
my buddy calvin from calvin show and 

933
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:31,220
he's like,
if you can run 12 miles,

934
00:42:31,221 --> 00:42:34,640
you can definitely run a marathon.
That's way longer,

935
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:35,763
but wait,
this all started because you guys did 

936
00:42:36,631 --> 00:42:37,820
this.
Speak is you can.

937
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,920
You can do it.
The question is,

938
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:40,843
is it easy?
There's not a fucking chance in the 

939
00:42:42,471 --> 00:42:44,930
world.
You saying I could run a marathon.

940
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,960
easy is an accurate statement.
I can give me a five hour marathon.

941
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,213
It's burt is not a statement.
It's hard to do when you're 285 pounds 

942
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,393
and you're out there.

943
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:08,510
Okay.
listen,

944
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,490
you fucking heard that and got so 
excited.

945
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:18,780
This all started.
It's hard to tell,

946
00:43:18,781 --> 00:43:19,650
man.
You ready to do.

947
00:43:19,651 --> 00:43:20,484
That's why it's great.
You're not going to concede that it's 

948
00:43:21,631 --> 00:43:24,360
hard to do.
It's definitely hard to do so,

949
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:28,800
but you for sure,
definitely want to marathon.

950
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,620
That's what you mean by easy for sure.
Why?

951
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:35,680
Why do you think you can definitely run 
every time funny,

952
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,270
a treadmill on the treadmill moves 
towards you.

953
00:43:38,271 --> 00:43:39,104
Get your legs up,
you get off and stopped to write stuff 

954
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,590
that's running.
You're lifting your legs up,

955
00:43:43,591 --> 00:43:44,424
but It's moving towards the treble.
Keeps going while you're off making a 

956
00:43:45,991 --> 00:43:46,824
fucking tito's and soda.
Can you do what you do a couple miles 

957
00:43:51,391 --> 00:43:52,440
and you run?
Walk.

958
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:53,443
I do run.
Walk.

959
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,730
I walk a quarter mile.
I run three quarters of a mile,

960
00:43:56,731 --> 00:43:59,370
quarter mile,
jesus to get my heart rate up and down.

961
00:43:59,371 --> 00:44:01,140
Fucking marathon.
You walk a quarter,

962
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,230
let's get my heart rate up.

963
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:03,540
I'll walk,
run,

964
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:04,171
walk,
run.

965
00:44:04,171 --> 00:44:06,080
One quarter.
but when you run sprints,

966
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,270
run three quarters of a mile,
walk a quarter,

967
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,213
five feet,
and then he the breaks and drinks box 

968
00:44:13,741 --> 00:44:14,574
wine.
So this is one of the new aluminum man 

969
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:19,980
box wine thing.
Set up on his treadmill.

970
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:23,040
No bullshit.
His drinking like a box of wine.

971
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:23,893
While we would your.
Would your approach to the marathon 

972
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,120
right now?
Be just wing it.

973
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:29,023
Good mood.
No plan seems to be a good or something 

974
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:34,650
online for your treadmill you need 
above.

975
00:44:34,651 --> 00:44:38,100
You like a durable feeder so you can 
drink while you're running a.

976
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,960
Somebody with a rubber attached to it.
This all started because a,

977
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:42,780
the guy you guys are claiming that is 
not a runner.

978
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:46,320
Had a profile written in about him on 
runner's world.

979
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:47,583
Yeah,
the photos.

980
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:48,443
He doesn't matter.
It's all the photos on to red would 

981
00:44:53,011 --> 00:44:56,580
write a profile about how he hates 
running demons.

982
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:58,043
You're better than him.
He'll write a whole story about how you 

983
00:44:59,511 --> 00:45:03,000
are definitely better than him,
but I'm gonna still out running in terms

984
00:45:03,001 --> 00:45:03,834
of the average marathon times.
Immediate average marathon was four 

985
00:45:06,471 --> 00:45:09,470
slash 20.
I can't do the finishing time and it's a

986
00:45:09,471 --> 00:45:10,304
medium I could.
I couldn't do for 20 to put to dieser 

987
00:45:11,941 --> 00:45:12,774
fucking people that are in really good 
shape to take into account the boston 

988
00:45:15,721 --> 00:45:16,920
marathon,
which is super hard.

989
00:45:16,921 --> 00:45:21,921
Hold on one second.
You know what I'm saying?

990
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:27,330
for marathon running shoes,
people don't wait to be any pause here.

991
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:30,150
It shouldn't be paused here and 
confusion as to whether or not you're in

992
00:45:30,151 --> 00:45:31,780
really good shape,
but you should get the site.

993
00:45:31,781 --> 00:45:34,740
You got your know.
You can't say this,

994
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:35,693
but hold on.
You can't say you're in really good 

995
00:45:36,511 --> 00:45:38,550
shape when you were attempting to say 
you're in really good shape.

996
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:39,413
Hold on,
I'll get super listening to get my 

997
00:45:41,671 --> 00:45:44,130
feelings hurt.
If you say you're in really good shape,

998
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,440
go.
I am in good shape.

999
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:48,980
You're way.
Let's.

1000
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:49,883
Let's just.
Let's just put the parameters down and 

1001
00:45:51,061 --> 00:45:53,520
then just pretend you think I'm not 
lying right now.

1002
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:54,503
You have a very good run.
I run five miles a day on the thing 

1003
00:45:57,451 --> 00:45:59,130
that's moving towards you and you lift 
your feet up.

1004
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,570
I agree.
I agree on that.

1005
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,430
I agree on that every day and I'll tell 
you what,

1006
00:46:02,431 --> 00:46:05,160
I'll go out and they'll run five in the 
road and if I noticed that difference,

1007
00:46:05,161 --> 00:46:06,120
I will say,
by the way,

1008
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:09,810
hey listen,
I'm not in really good shape.

1009
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:11,950
I'm not in really good shape.
Miles,

1010
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:12,803
I'm in decent shape and I work out a lot
like crazy ruthless shit and I wouldn't 

1011
00:46:18,361 --> 00:46:19,350
say,
you know why?

1012
00:46:19,351 --> 00:46:22,410
Because I know actual people that are in
really good shape.

1013
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,280
Yeah,
okay.

1014
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:24,750
That I'm not in really good shape.
Okay?

1015
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:25,993
Now I'll listen to the important thing.
When you're discussing all these like 

1016
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,710
baby,
it's just like I ran.

1017
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:39,770
I ran a five k drunk one time and go 
half of the fucking field trauma.

1018
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,370
We thought it was.
Oh,

1019
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,010
that's right.
you told me about so and so what?

1020
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:49,470
But I beat half of the fucking field.
Now those are the same people,

1021
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:54,210
but the people drink and they came there
for a radio station to pub crawl.

1022
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,850
Yeah.
One of them are actually elite athletes.

1023
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:56,723
Wasn't a pub crawl.
it was an actual five k that I thought 

1024
00:46:58,711 --> 00:47:01,230
was a pub crawl,
so I drank five beers before it thinking

1025
00:47:01,231 --> 00:47:05,440
we'd be draining and it was a fucking 
five k and I beat half the fucking.

1026
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:07,500
Can I say something?
It's a.

1027
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,340
It's over three miles because I'm a 
runner.

1028
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:12,390
when you say you're in good shape,
yes.

1029
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:15,570
Literally the shape of you is bad.

1030
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:19,700
I'll take away.
We're all gonna.

1031
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:20,880
Have different versions of what we 
think.

1032
00:47:20,881 --> 00:47:24,000
Good shape and you can't have a low bar 
when you're talking about reality.

1033
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,680
You're not allowed a little bar.
When you talk about things like shape.

1034
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:30,100
I,
I cannot run.

1035
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,260
I could by the way.
I couldn't.

1036
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,740
I couldn't run.
I can't believe I'm fucking.

1037
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,330
I just got off the treadmill this 
morning.

1038
00:47:37,331 --> 00:47:38,164
I was like,
maybe I should take a video and show 

1039
00:47:38,651 --> 00:47:39,484
them what I'm running.
You passed out drunk there and then 

1040
00:47:40,901 --> 00:47:42,590
granted it's a treadmill.
It's not trail.

1041
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,424
This trail,
as you run this three miles this 

1042
00:47:45,551 --> 00:47:46,780
morning,
because I was,

1043
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:47,723
we had to drain our pool.
There's no benefit whatsoever to 

1044
00:47:50,561 --> 00:47:53,900
exaggerating fitness levels.
I'm not at that level,

1045
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:57,310
but there's an ego issue when people do 
it and you just can't do it,

1046
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:58,900
but you can't say I'm in great shape.

1047
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:00,820
There's no fucking way.
You're in great shape.

1048
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:01,813
It's really not possible,
but you are in good shape for somebody 

1049
00:48:04,301 --> 00:48:07,870
that's in terrible shape.
I agree with that.

1050
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,370
Agree with that.
Agree with that.

1051
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:10,970
And the other thing is,
you know,

1052
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,910
like you do stuff,
you know you're active,

1053
00:48:12,911 --> 00:48:14,140
you definitely do stuff.
Okay.

1054
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:14,974
Yet,
if we could get you to do those things 

1055
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,163
and not drink,
you would be in a measurably healthier 

1056
00:48:20,561 --> 00:48:22,810
person.
It'd be 100 percent.

1057
00:48:22,811 --> 00:48:25,780
Do you think that that would be 
something that you had wanted to do that

1058
00:48:25,781 --> 00:48:28,030
guy burt and shape?
No,

1059
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:31,990
there's still no fit.
Their weight,

1060
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:34,930
but I think it's 2:17
that you're pretty fit.

1061
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:38,630
Their like fate or in his prime?
Yeah,

1062
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:39,870
for real.
No,

1063
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,000
he looked very fit there.
He looks strong too.

1064
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,170
I was 2:17
to 15.

1065
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:48,900
That's a different.
That's only four pounds.

1066
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,460
That's two.
That's three.

1067
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:55,920
Eight at least around your belly come 
clean son.

1068
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,300
Did you.
Were you in denial housing,

1069
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:01,423
the flop out in the knots or do they 
have to bring other scales in order to 

1070
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:10,130
get badly looking at this picture at the
top of your pants.

1071
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:14,020
Into your pubic hair.
Standing up.

1072
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:14,411
Oh,
hey.

1073
00:49:14,411 --> 00:49:15,940
Pull up a picture of tom.
Why don't we.

1074
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,360
Tom never got that big.
Got bigger.

1075
00:49:19,361 --> 00:49:20,220
Joe.
We've got a belly.

1076
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,433
He got bigger because he's five,
nine and under six foot or cirrhosis of 

1077
00:49:28,301 --> 00:49:29,380
the liver for sure.
Right?

1078
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:29,990
No,
no,

1079
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:31,270
no.
It's only affecting the gut.

1080
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,090
God,
is there an over under on you right now?

1081
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:37,110
I'd say 54.
Wow.

1082
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:43,900
It looks great.
Beard does not look good.

1083
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,890
It looks better there,
but on the other one,

1084
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,150
maybe it's there,
but I do think he's got a beard there.

1085
00:49:51,151 --> 00:49:53,560
HIs head would be twice as large book.
Yeah.

1086
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,550
That's unhealthy.
Sweaty.

1087
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:57,523
Yeah,
but here,

1088
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:58,720
how about this?
Look at them now.

1089
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:03,260
One hundred 80 pounds.
Yeah.

1090
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:05,250
I guess like when 95.
Oh,

1091
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:06,093
this is killing me.
This is making me regret ever texting 

1092
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,560
you.
We're still proud.

1093
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:15,340
I was.
Runner's world could run a marathon.

1094
00:50:15,341 --> 00:50:19,330
You said that's obviously one bit.
Wait,

1095
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,200
wait,
but we have to.

1096
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:21,700
We have to obviously.
Wait,

1097
00:50:21,701 --> 00:50:24,730
let's set up because here's the deal.
I do run every single day.

1098
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,010
Every single day.
I'd probably run a five,

1099
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,340
four times a week.
I'm running.

1100
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,233
I'm running no less than five miles on a
day like today is a little bit of a 

1101
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:32,960
difference.
Let me ask you something.

1102
00:50:32,961 --> 00:50:35,600
Shoot.
When are you proposing that the marathon

1103
00:50:35,601 --> 00:50:36,540
take place?
Look,

1104
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,820
I just think that's an important.

1105
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:43,943
That's an important thing to decide 
which one you proposed from tuesday a 

1106
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,610
year.
I am sweating.

1107
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,470
I need you to back me up a tad bit.
I used to.

1108
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,293
I've always been.
I've always conceited that you are a 

1109
00:51:00,951 --> 00:51:05,951
great natural runner guy.
You're the man of human shape.

1110
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:12,390
You have to have good endurance running.
You do.

1111
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,340
Hey,
you have a natural stride.

1112
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:19,870
No natural advantage in this.
I'm like,

1113
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,530
First of all,
is everybody jumping in on this?

1114
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,371
Is everybody going to.
No,

1115
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:22,641
no,
no,

1116
00:51:22,641 --> 00:51:23,690
no.
This is all pile on.

1117
00:51:23,691 --> 00:51:24,550
Burton.
Burt's got approved.

1118
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:29,060
He's not a liar because you said you 
going to be tom.

1119
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:31,010
I cannot meet you.
I will do something.

1120
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,440
Okay.
I do not know if it would be a marathon.

1121
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,333
I don't know.
I would have to put a lot of time into 

1122
00:51:36,351 --> 00:51:37,310
running.
I put.

1123
00:51:37,311 --> 00:51:37,821
Can you,
can you,

1124
00:51:37,821 --> 00:51:39,920
will you consider another resources to 
do that right now?

1125
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,753
Yeah.
So another idea I had that I pitched to 

1126
00:51:42,681 --> 00:51:43,514
you a little while ago was what if we 
did a one day decathlon style event 

1127
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:50,023
where it's multiple,
like you have like seven different 

1128
00:51:52,221 --> 00:51:53,430
things you do is.
Yes.

1129
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:54,343
I will tell you that I bike around a lot
so when we get into cath lab thing then 

1130
00:51:59,711 --> 00:52:00,544
no,
you would have no chance of still 

1131
00:52:01,461 --> 00:52:02,960
finishing.
Still even finishing.

1132
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:04,683
Wow.
I'm sorta like putt putt was one of the 

1133
00:52:06,831 --> 00:52:08,660
events.
We'd have something heavy there.

1134
00:52:08,661 --> 00:52:11,640
So you couldn't do that and then I don't
know.

1135
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,210
Oh,
maybe though you dominate.

1136
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:14,930
We had some sort of eating contests.
No,

1137
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,420
dominate,
dominate.

1138
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:22,050
I had to do what I did the night before,
so we all have to drink.

1139
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,620
When you guys were mocking him being 
five,

1140
00:52:27,621 --> 00:52:28,790
nine,
I wish I was five.

1141
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:31,400
Nine.
Take it on the chin.

1142
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,380
This reality here,
motherfuckers.

1143
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:35,740
Okay,
let's get 300.

1144
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:39,430
Twenty six pounds.
Now here's.

1145
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:44,330
There's two aspects to the bet.
The bet is we're going to coming up with

1146
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:46,820
something physical,
some type of physical competition,

1147
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:50,090
and then how long we're going to go 
totally sober for.

1148
00:52:50,091 --> 00:52:51,350
You were saying 90 days,
right?

1149
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,560
We're allowing marijuana.
Let's.

1150
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:55,423
Let's be real.
If I'm going to be real about 

1151
00:52:56,331 --> 00:52:59,330
everything.
You guys going to be real?

1152
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:01,040
I can't.
I cannot do 90 days.

1153
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:04,340
I don't want to thank you.
Thank you for quitting.

1154
00:53:04,341 --> 00:53:07,910
Before we started and coming off these 
ridiculous statements and whatever,

1155
00:53:07,911 --> 00:53:11,690
we think everyone's going to be.
Whatever we agreed to,

1156
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:14,060
you're definitely going to be wearing a 
scram cam.

1157
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:15,373
What's the scram?
Continuous continuous alcohol 

1158
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:22,361
monitoring.
Everybody else is on the honor code,

1159
00:53:22,671 --> 00:53:26,010
but bert has to wear a scram.
It's

1160
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:30,860
for high risk offenders because you get 
one,

1161
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,960
of course you cops that listen,
that would hook us sweating profusely.

1162
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:43,470
If you fail the alcohol part,
the bed is over.

1163
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,990
There's no more competition otherwise it
has no stake,

1164
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,890
so it has to be seat.
I'd you know,

1165
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:51,310
I'd be down to do something,
but the problem with running a marathon,

1166
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,070
a marathon,
right,

1167
00:53:53,071 --> 00:53:55,650
without really fucking your body up,
you should build towards it.

1168
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:59,160
You could probably run americans,
you That logic and common sense.

1169
00:53:59,161 --> 00:54:00,870
Why would you do that?
Here's the thing,

1170
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:01,853
I'm not averse to a challenge,
but I'm not interested in destroying my 

1171
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:07,620
body capital on over many days.
If you're going to do a marathon,

1172
00:54:07,621 --> 00:54:11,980
I feel like you should give yourself 
some time and run a five k,

1173
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:14,220
five k,
five k,

1174
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,630
five k in vegas in january of 2000 
meters.

1175
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:19,170
Yeah,
do.

1176
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:20,610
I didn't run at all.

1177
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:23,250
It did zero preparation.
I mean none.

1178
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:25,560
I completed it,
but it was way tougher than I thought it

1179
00:54:25,561 --> 00:54:26,360
was.
Oh my god.

1180
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,193
I just.
It's about three miles because my 

1181
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,393
fucking thanksgiving a couple years ago 
in cincinnati and agreed to a 10 k 

1182
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:38,890
training that was unbelievable.
Pain meds.

1183
00:54:38,891 --> 00:54:39,270
I'm like,
god,

1184
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:41,530
how long did it take you?
I don't have no idea.

1185
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,140
I have no idea,
but it was.

1186
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,370
I was in real pain,
man,

1187
00:54:44,371 --> 00:54:46,890
so I started running after it.
After they did it,

1188
00:54:46,891 --> 00:54:47,724
I was like,
okay,

1189
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:48,953
this is not good.
It's not good that I can't run three 

1190
00:54:50,011 --> 00:54:52,580
miles and not be like,
how much are you running?

1191
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,670
Well,
one hills.

1192
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:57,600
I'm not running flat.
See,

1193
00:54:57,601 --> 00:54:58,434
that's my argument to is that I think 
that what people were worried about is 

1194
00:55:00,361 --> 00:55:01,320
two things.
One,

1195
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:02,783
this traditional running shoe.
We have the big fat heel at the bottom 

1196
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:06,810
and you land on your heel.

1197
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,090
Yeah.
That was all invented by nike.

1198
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:10,051
Really?
Yeah.

1199
00:55:10,051 --> 00:55:12,150
You're not supposed to run and land on 
your heels.

1200
00:55:12,151 --> 00:55:15,690
You're supposed to run and land on the 
ball of your foot and your foot in the.

1201
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:16,573
You know the strength of your foot and 
your calf and all that shit decelerates 

1202
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:21,540
your stride.
That's how people are designed to run.

1203
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:24,840
That's how everybody's supposed to run,
but somewhere along the line,

1204
00:55:24,841 --> 00:55:29,190
nike came up with this fat heal and they
changed the way people run.

1205
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:33,210
Now they run like he'll heal.
You jusT not supposed to do that,

1206
00:55:33,211 --> 00:55:35,250
man.
Suppose to run your toes,

1207
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:37,290
feel your feet and the ball of your 
feet,

1208
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:41,820
so things like these,
these things have like zero soul.

1209
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:42,953
There's just like this thin rubber that 
would protect you from stepping on hard 

1210
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:48,390
sticks.
Shit.

1211
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,920
That's it.
You know,

1212
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:53,370
and by walking and stuff that you're 
supposed to walk in,

1213
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:54,413
your feet gets stronger by running,
continuously run like when you're on 

1214
00:55:57,421 --> 00:55:58,254
those hills,
like just keep going to these vibram 

1215
00:55:59,911 --> 00:56:00,744
five finger trail shoes and it's like 
they're so thin that the other day it 

1216
00:56:04,531 --> 00:56:05,364
was so hot out that my feet got hot.
Like I could feel the heat of round 

1217
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,550
coming through the salt super thin 
runner.

1218
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:14,510
Neil runs ones the barefoot,
they're like griffith park and she was a

1219
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:15,383
better man than I.
I bought a pair of those when I saw you 

1220
00:56:17,701 --> 00:56:18,670
had them.
I bought a pair.

1221
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:19,893
I thought that would help and then like 
the very next week I was on the beach 

1222
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:24,190
and I was like,
you know how to run barefoot?

1223
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:24,761
Man.
I woke up,

1224
00:56:24,761 --> 00:56:27,450
my feet were so fucking sore in places I
didn't even know

1225
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:28,450
muscles.
Yeah.

1226
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:29,284
That's the thing,
we don't usually use our feet correctly 

1227
00:56:31,241 --> 00:56:32,074
because our feeder in these hard 
sneakers and the heart sneakers act as 

1228
00:56:35,171 --> 00:56:38,800
like a cast and so your muscles in your 
feet atrophy.

1229
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,500
They got a class action lawsuit against 
them,

1230
00:56:41,501 --> 00:56:42,630
but for anybody who.
No,

1231
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:43,483
no,
vibram five fingers shoes did because 

1232
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:49,000
they created these thin toe shoes.
There's a bunch of people got injured.

1233
00:56:49,001 --> 00:56:50,500
They said they will protect you from 
injury,

1234
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:51,543
but not repetitive stress injury.
Not like you not being conditioned for 

1235
00:56:54,701 --> 00:56:55,534
them injury.
there's a bunch of injuries that you 

1236
00:56:56,651 --> 00:56:58,870
absolutely can get.
I'm sure people are suing them.

1237
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:01,960
Yeah.
You know what their claims were ruled to

1238
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:03,590
be.
Either they settled or they.

1239
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:08,140
There was enough ambiguity in what they 
were claiming enough like,

1240
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,053
you know,
what they were trying to say is that 

1241
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:11,794
they help you somehow or another from 
injuries they could overall in the long 

1242
00:57:16,451 --> 00:57:17,284
run,
but you've got to condition yourself to 

1243
00:57:18,191 --> 00:57:19,480
where those fucking things.
Sure.

1244
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:20,343
and if you don't,
you get like neal brennan blew out his 

1245
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,900
plantar fasciitis feet for fucked up for
a year,

1246
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:27,940
wearing nose from running on a treadmill
with those.

1247
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:28,893
He just wasn't fit for it.
Like you have to do a lot of shit 

1248
00:57:32,021 --> 00:57:35,380
barefoot to build up all those muscles 
in your feet.

1249
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:35,840
PuT a,
a.

1250
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,520
Showed us all the time.
Yeah.

1251
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:38,703
Just walking with my heels would hurt 
somebody that tell me that this 

1252
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:44,290
stretches to like,
how do you treat it?

1253
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,333
Do you remember?

1254
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,870
You sent me to a rolfer oh yeah.
I remember I went to a role for.

1255
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:49,773
It's so bad.
That's when I started gaining my weight 

1256
00:57:51,071 --> 00:57:52,570
was the same thing,
happened to neil,

1257
00:57:52,571 --> 00:57:55,260
happened to me.
I blew out my plantar fasciitis and uh,

1258
00:57:55,261 --> 00:57:58,660
and at the time I was probably like 
probably exactly what I weigh right now.

1259
00:57:58,661 --> 00:58:01,960
Maybe even more,
but I got two to 65 because I could not,

1260
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:07,140
I couldn't walk because hurt.
I went to a rolfer and for this guy,

1261
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:10,213
his name ricky,
the offer or something is that I got to 

1262
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:15,370
hollywood and these are legit rick,
counteroffer I think.

1263
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:18,610
And uh,
he goes in with his knuckle into the,

1264
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:21,520
into the muscle or to the attendant and 
breaks up the fascia.

1265
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:25,240
And I started it and he goes,
just so you know,

1266
00:58:25,241 --> 00:58:27,190
you can yell.
And I was screaming,

1267
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:28,990
screaming,
screaming.

1268
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:31,240
There was a sign on the,
on the set,

1269
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:32,860
on the ceiling that you're looking at 
that says,

1270
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:34,570
don't worry,
go to the light.

1271
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:36,203
And I was fucking screaming.
I called you the second I got done 

1272
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:41,620
because I walked out of that place in 
flip flops and went,

1273
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:44,120
I can fucking walk.
And I called joe.

1274
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:45,610
I was on laurel canyon.
I was like,

1275
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:46,870
it was two things.
I was like,

1276
00:58:46,871 --> 00:58:47,591
hey,
can you tweet it out?

1277
00:58:47,591 --> 00:58:50,590
My date and portland had the wrong 
color.

1278
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:51,483
I did say that ricky the ra for sounds 
like a name under care for a character 

1279
00:58:58,331 --> 00:58:59,830
in a tim and eric show.
It's don.

1280
00:58:59,831 --> 00:59:04,831
The role for the for plantar fasciitis 
been was no joke.

1281
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:09,760
Cruz got that when he came back after 
his surgery.

1282
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:10,421
Really?
Yeah.

1283
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:11,770
Tried to go too hard,
too quick.

1284
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:14,020
Feet feeder all taped up.
Now whenever he fIghts.

1285
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:17,620
Well that's why I walked.
I walked that first 15 minutes.

1286
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,870
Walk one mile,
tend to loosen up.

1287
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:21,063
Some fucking happened in my butter.
If you roll your toes in the beginning 

1288
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:24,920
of the day too,
when you're lying in bed with your foot,

1289
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:27,860
you just do this 10 times,
10 times that way.

1290
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:31,400
Which foot do 100 pushups?
Why don't they know?

1291
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:35,420
I'm joking.
Can you do maybe three?

1292
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:37,850
Get the fuck out of here.
I can't do chin ups.

1293
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,050
Chin ups,
man.

1294
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:40,320
How come you only do three?
I,

1295
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,130
I,
when I was going to bootcamp or not,

1296
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:44,960
you know,
chin up guy.

1297
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:50,350
It's a lot of weIght.
To lift up is pretty impressive.

1298
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:57,110
We buy into the propaganda of bonds,
but we're honest.

1299
00:59:57,170 --> 01:00:00,410
I feel like Donald Trump right now.
I don't know if uber rock,

1300
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:04,970
obama and trump totally do it.
I could do for.

1301
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:05,953
Are you proposing though that?
What are you proposing with the no 

1302
01:00:08,901 --> 01:00:12,220
alcohol that was you guys that started 
that I w I,

1303
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:14,360
I am personally.
Personally,

1304
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:15,711
I thought.
I don't mInd.

1305
01:00:15,711 --> 01:00:16,544
I think it's one of the things I liked 
about the challenge that I did was that 

1306
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:22,640
people got into it as well and could do 
it with us and they started shaming each

1307
01:00:22,641 --> 01:00:23,474
other and that's the one thing.
That's the feedback that I've gotten 

1308
01:00:24,741 --> 01:00:26,120
from it is when people are like,
dude,

1309
01:00:26,121 --> 01:00:27,670
me and my buddy started fat shaming each
other.

1310
01:00:27,671 --> 01:00:28,580
Yeah,
that's cool.

1311
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:31,370
It's a lot of that feel like the booze

1312
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:32,423
option of taking booze off the table for
90 months or 90 days rather than a 

1313
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:39,403
stroke,
which was like you on the pch and a 

1314
01:00:46,151 --> 01:00:51,151
motorcycle and you see your guy texting 
for you doing that for 90 days,

1315
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,910
just too daunting.
Ninety days.

1316
01:00:53,370 --> 01:00:54,203
So is it.
But is it because you appreciate the 

1317
01:00:57,481 --> 01:00:58,314
feeling that being drunk gives you?
Is it because you enjoy going onstage 

1318
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:04,140
drunk?
No,

1319
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:05,480
I don't.
I don't drink on stage.

1320
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:06,860
I will bring a cocktail on stage with 
me,

1321
01:01:06,861 --> 01:01:09,230
but I never performed drunk ever.
Ever.

1322
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:11,260
I mean I have but I don't.
And,

1323
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,340
and you can ask anyone that's ever seen 
me for them.

1324
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,880
I have a tito's and soda on stage with 
me and I've barely touched it.

1325
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,790
I feel like there's definitely some 
tweets coming in like I saw you hammered

1326
01:01:19,791 --> 01:01:20,624
it

1327
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:23,380
four shots at stage.
Here's the thing,

1328
01:01:23,381 --> 01:01:24,214
here's one thing that I've ever 
absolutely promised I've never done and 

1329
01:01:26,471 --> 01:01:28,600
never will do.
I will never drink a fake shot.

1330
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,950
I've never drank,
never drank a shot.

1331
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:33,250
That shit.
TheY do that shit.

1332
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:34,270
They're like,
so and so does this.

1333
01:01:34,271 --> 01:01:35,140
I was like,
no,

1334
01:01:35,141 --> 01:01:40,141
I'm not going to take a picture that 
just don't bring up some do.

1335
01:01:40,671 --> 01:01:41,504
Did that to me.
And like I don't remember where it was 

1336
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:44,830
and he just looked at me and I dragged 
her.

1337
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:47,740
What the fuck was that?
I like looked at him and I go,

1338
01:01:47,741 --> 01:01:49,660
what was that?
And he goes,

1339
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:54,340
what did you just give me a fake shot?
I go,

1340
01:01:54,341 --> 01:01:55,690
do not do that,
sir.

1341
01:01:55,691 --> 01:01:56,524
I go,
go back there and you get yourself some 

1342
01:01:57,491 --> 01:02:00,550
Jack Daniels.
Get me a real god damn shot.

1343
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:04,390
What kind of amateur night shit is this?
Some people do though that would request

1344
01:02:04,391 --> 01:02:06,880
that and they would be like,
we're partying here fuckers.

1345
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:08,443
Oh my,
my rule is don't shove me shots the 

1346
01:02:09,751 --> 01:02:12,240
stage because I can't not do them.
Oh yeah,

1347
01:02:12,241 --> 01:02:13,230
of course.
Yeah.

1348
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:15,440
Or I'd be cannot do it.
So let's,

1349
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:16,620
I mean,
let's be candid.

1350
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:17,670
Yeah.
Now you can,

1351
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:19,220
like people,
they,

1352
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:21,120
when I go out in the road of that for 
them,

1353
01:02:21,121 --> 01:02:24,360
that might be their party for the month.
And so I've,

1354
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:29,550
I get offered so many shots.
I think it will blow you away.

1355
01:02:29,551 --> 01:02:32,530
Like how many fireball,
how many just vodka shots get send.

1356
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:36,570
What would happen if you left the club 
just like right after the show and went,

1357
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:39,700
went back to your room?
I don't know.

1358
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:43,973
I tried to do a one time I tried that 
and it got lost and the manager was 

1359
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:48,541
like,
hey man,

1360
01:02:48,541 --> 01:02:49,374
uh,
hooked up,

1361
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:51,150
we told everyone that you're going to 
this bar,

1362
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:53,070
it's packed,
they're waiting for you.

1363
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,620
And I got there and then tito's had sent
me a snowboard and it was like get my,

1364
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:00,060
my meet and greets are a little 
different cause I don't mind hanging.

1365
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:01,290
I mean,
I know we all don't mind,

1366
01:03:01,291 --> 01:03:02,124
but like I don't mind,
I would much rather not do a meet and 

1367
01:03:03,931 --> 01:03:04,764
greet and just go to a bar at the end of
the night and just if you want to come 

1368
01:03:06,421 --> 01:03:07,890
up and tell me that you liked the 
podcast,

1369
01:03:07,891 --> 01:03:10,890
you'd love tommy and or you think are,
he's funnier than tom,

1370
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,470
whatever,
but I liked that.

1371
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:16,650
I don't mind that and that is part of 
what I do and I can ask a question.

1372
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:17,483
Sure.
Do you think it's weird that alcohol 

1373
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:20,910
companies are sending you things?
Just gifts and.

1374
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:23,850
No,
but don't you say a snowboard?

1375
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,520
You had tIto sent me a snowboard,
snowboard while you're drinking.

1376
01:03:26,521 --> 01:03:29,610
That shit shouldn't be real clear about 
that and I gave it to them.

1377
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:30,803
I don't use what we're sending you use 
what we make a note that we should be 

1378
01:03:40,411 --> 01:03:43,860
sure it's super clear.
Otherwise you just see tito sends me.

1379
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:44,694
Usually the local reps will send me like
a gift basket in my room every week 

1380
01:03:47,681 --> 01:03:51,030
before I get there.
Like some sort of a deal with them.

1381
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:52,020
uh,
they don't,

1382
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:54,020
they don't do that.
I don't know,

1383
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:55,583
but you don't drink it because I lost 
weight when I was drinking tito's and I 

1384
01:03:59,341 --> 01:04:00,210
was like,
well fuck it.

1385
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,410
He's switched to vaka.

1386
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:08,850
Move strong move for health.
I got told that somewhere overseas and I

1387
01:04:08,851 --> 01:04:09,684
was like,
I don't have gained weight when I'm so 

1388
01:04:10,501 --> 01:04:12,730
much more active and I'm eating less 
processed food.

1389
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:14,270
She's like tchenguiz beer.
Yeah.

1390
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:16,110
Switched to fucking gin and tonic or 
something.

1391
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:17,001
Take care of yourself.
Wait,

1392
01:04:17,001 --> 01:04:17,791
wait.
We also.

1393
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:18,624
It's all week.
We set up that you said definitely not 

1394
01:04:20,551 --> 01:04:21,550
90 days.
Okay.

1395
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:26,420
I'm going to use 30 days sober.
Yeah.

1396
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,740
When he got to go some time.
Okay.

1397
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,150
I feel like I'm negotiating a hostage.
Hold on.

1398
01:04:33,151 --> 01:04:34,060
Let me talk to them.
Yeah,

1399
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:37,290
I can't do it,
so I'm going to Australia or Singapore.

1400
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:39,120
There's no way you're doing that in 
Australia.

1401
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,200
They'll never let you be,
so why can't you do?

1402
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:43,110
Why can't we just start it before you go
on the trip?

1403
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,150
Come on man.
When is that trip?

1404
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,620
Why do you talk?
How do you get on this podcast?

1405
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:48,803
You don't know me.

1406
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:53,560
You can do 30 days.
You're always gonna.

1407
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:56,730
Have an excuse why you're not doing it,
so why not just do it starting tomorrow?

1408
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,930
I talked to,
I talked to know that can't lose.

1409
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:00,553
I talked to him about it because dan 
hope set when I told him about our 

1410
01:05:02,371 --> 01:05:03,204
conversation and he's like,
I'll do 30 days stan hope with god in 

1411
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,241
standups,
and he goes,

1412
01:05:06,241 --> 01:05:08,370
but you gotta you gotta give me a heads 
up because I got to carve it out.

1413
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:11,400
Take some stuff away from her,
like risks and hope takes him.

1414
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:12,263
He's like,
I can't.

1415
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:14,310
And actually he was really excited about
it.

1416
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:19,060
I can't because I'm in Singapore on the 
personally 11th sydney on the 13th.

1417
01:05:19,061 --> 01:05:23,170
Melbourne and sydney on the m three has 
been on the 18th.

1418
01:05:23,171 --> 01:05:25,840
Guys find me an Australia please in 
sydney and melbourne.

1419
01:05:25,841 --> 01:05:27,720
Those tickets are moving slower than 
tom's work.

1420
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:31,673
You couldn't do a night in Singapore and
Singapore on your weight from Australia 

1421
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:35,860
also.
You're going to be at,

1422
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:37,810
but you couldn't do one night without 
getting drunk.

1423
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:41,140
It's like it's the flights by the way.
I can do what?

1424
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:43,960
I can do the lights,
right?

1425
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,640
It's the flights.
Are you going to do any flight?

1426
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:47,440
Are going to do any.
You're scared.

1427
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:49,450
I'm willing.
I'm willing.

1428
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:53,770
I'm willing to do 30 days in october,
October 1st to the end of october.

1429
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:57,640
Not thanksgiving,
halloween.

1430
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:58,870
Why that I have.
I have.

1431
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,620
Because I have a couple of road dates 
and I'm an I and I,

1432
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:04,580
I will be very candid with you.
Okay.

1433
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,820
I do need to learn how to fly sober.
Yeah,

1434
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:08,890
but I can't do it to Australia.

1435
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:13,990
I would never do that.
I pretty much always fly liquored up.

1436
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:16,990
Yeah man.
But hold on and now I'm telling you this

1437
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:18,340
always.
You fly a lot.

1438
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:21,250
Wait a minute.
Flight to san francisco.

1439
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:24,860
We flew to san francisco and our flight,
that's an hour flight.

1440
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:29,380
Let's recap.
Let's recap.

1441
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,490
Started off.
Fuck me.

1442
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:36,510
Start.
When do you have on that flight?

1443
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:39,700
I brought it.
I brought a cocktail to your house,

1444
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:42,903
but it was.
There was a party that was a party that 

1445
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:46,330
night.
That's a different thing.

1446
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:48,250
Can you describe the cup?
It was,

1447
01:06:48,251 --> 01:06:52,960
I think it was a 32 ounce,
32 ounce a styrofoam cups.

1448
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,153
By the way,
I've cut back on 32 ounce dot and then 

1449
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:01,090
in the airport and the flight together,
it was eight by the way.

1450
01:07:01,091 --> 01:07:02,560
Hold on,
I got to tell you this,

1451
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:04,480
you know,
for a fact that when we sat down and the

1452
01:07:04,481 --> 01:07:07,030
thing and the guy recognized me,
he didn't even ask what I wanted.

1453
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:10,960
He brought what I said one for tommy and
okay,

1454
01:07:10,961 --> 01:07:12,490
now listen.
Those are like,

1455
01:07:12,491 --> 01:07:13,324
what's up?
bert at the airport bar bartender came 

1456
01:07:18,521 --> 01:07:22,240
by to say hi because I tip well and I,
and by the way I don't like flying.

1457
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:26,890
I had a period of time with a prescribed
me on xanax and that got away from me.

1458
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:27,993
It literally.
Did you get on a plane so you always 

1459
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:32,090
take one,
one,

1460
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:33,083
like a slippery fish headed downstream.
I take one in the morning before the 

1461
01:07:36,491 --> 01:07:38,380
flight I get,
we'll take them on the plane and then.

1462
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:40,331
So I was like,
um,

1463
01:07:40,331 --> 01:07:41,560
no xanax.
It's not healthy.

1464
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:43,173
I was like,
booze,

1465
01:07:43,590 --> 01:07:46,000
booze,
it up on flights home as well as flights

1466
01:07:46,001 --> 01:07:47,040
there.
Oh yeah.

1467
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:48,920
More so on those.
Jesus.

1468
01:07:49,370 --> 01:07:50,500
Yeah.
I'm being honest.

1469
01:07:50,501 --> 01:07:50,910
Please.
No,

1470
01:07:50,910 --> 01:07:52,930
no.
This is going to be a tough challenge.

1471
01:07:52,931 --> 01:07:53,764
We're still.
We're down to 60 days is what you're 

1472
01:07:54,431 --> 01:07:56,980
saying?
I can do.

1473
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:58,360
I can do october.
I think.

1474
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:00,730
What's.
What's the travel schedule like?

1475
01:08:00,731 --> 01:08:05,731
Just peeing what?
You can't fucking see it so he just keep

1476
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:08,890
going.
Too much of an animal.

1477
01:08:08,891 --> 01:08:11,140
Just go to the bathroom.
I don't want to miss any of this.

1478
01:08:11,410 --> 01:08:12,760
This is nothing to miss,
man.

1479
01:08:12,761 --> 01:08:14,870
We're talking shit and he's already 
agreed to 55 days.

1480
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:16,070
We'll recap you.

1481
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:16,881
Don't worry,
ma'am.

1482
01:08:16,881 --> 01:08:18,260
We'll just let everybody know that 
you're paying.

1483
01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:20,030
Now we have to deal with this jug.
Oh,

1484
01:08:20,031 --> 01:08:20,864
piss the nasty.
It's thinking about the difference 

1485
01:08:24,351 --> 01:08:27,830
between a glass of kombucha and a glass 
of piss.

1486
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:31,760
Piss.
Smell slightly are definitely true.

1487
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:36,470
If you didn't enjoy like the taste of 
kombucha and you just smelled it for the

1488
01:08:36,471 --> 01:08:37,730
first time,
it's like kimchi,

1489
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,100
kimchi for the first time.
You're like,

1490
01:08:40,101 --> 01:08:44,770
what the fuck is in the shot?
You're holding your ticket.

1491
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:48,470
You're in the middle of a piss.
Do you need like a larger container?

1492
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:49,910
Yeah,
he's going to switch.

1493
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,480
Just drinking water.
You got to switch that damn animal.

1494
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:57,020
Just go to the bathroom.
What's wrong with you on my floor?

1495
01:08:57,021 --> 01:09:00,590
For sure.
You're plugging your dick into the whole

1496
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:05,110
curating,
like constriction of the pis.

1497
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:07,320
Whole is not the first time I piss in a 
bottle job.

1498
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:09,703
It's time you piss in a bottle here.
He pissed it up all the last time you 

1499
01:09:12,771 --> 01:09:13,800
were here.
He's an animal.

1500
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,170
Doesn't sound like me at all.

1501
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,020
Bird,
how are you finding october.

1502
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:22,860
Everywhere.
This is what makes it tricky.

1503
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:25,590
Uh,
but I'm totally,

1504
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:27,380
I'm totally,
uh,

1505
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:30,510
I mean I'd love to sculpt it so it 
didn't make a tricky,

1506
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:35,370
but I'm a dc on the 30th of September,
so a cross country flight,

1507
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:38,750
cross country flight on the first will 
be my first of do my first,

1508
01:09:38,751 --> 01:09:40,810
an old little while.
Uh,

1509
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:41,763
I have done them recently,
but that would be my first one on the 

1510
01:09:43,501 --> 01:09:44,630
first,
uh,

1511
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:47,490
funded on the six hour flight on the.
This is where it gets complicated.

1512
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:52,440
It failed right there.
Where's the second failure coming?

1513
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:57,210
I have a chicago on the 19th to the 21st
or 22nd.

1514
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:58,073
That can't be right.
You can get through at that time of 

1515
01:09:59,881 --> 01:10:00,714
flight situation that's hanging out in 
chicago without drinking good places to 

1516
01:10:05,341 --> 01:10:08,550
drink though.
That's why it's a good challenge.

1517
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:09,330
Yeah,
I could.

1518
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:12,300
I could do it.
I'm doing a college the night before and

1519
01:10:12,301 --> 01:10:13,134
I'm sure that the reason I got hired as 
they all want to hang out with me at a 

1520
01:10:15,121 --> 01:10:16,200
bar afterwards.
That's fine.

1521
01:10:16,201 --> 01:10:17,130
I'll just get in the car.

1522
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:18,233
No,
listen,

1523
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,900
people get hired because you're a funny 
comedian.

1524
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,970
Don't hire you just because they get

1525
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:27,070
drink with you.
I got hired at for a corporate for a lot

1526
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:28,450
of money and I was like,
that doesn't seem right.

1527
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:29,343
And I got up there and I started doing 
the guy who was telling the machine and 

1528
01:10:31,001 --> 01:10:32,680
let us go to a bar.
And I was like,

1529
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:34,063
alright.
So I told the machine and we went to a 

1530
01:10:34,811 --> 01:10:36,580
bar and aspen and I was like,
fuck it.

1531
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:38,620
If that's what you guys wanted for that,
I'll do it.

1532
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:41,140
Wow.
That's so weird to corporate as bunch of

1533
01:10:41,141 --> 01:10:42,850
millionaires from New York who just are 
like,

1534
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:44,950
we want that fucking guy.
We want that story.

1535
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:46,143
Let's fucking party

1536
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:50,120
areas.

1537
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:50,871
Yeah.
And then.

1538
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:53,450
And then this is where it gets it.
Uh,

1539
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:55,540
yeah.
I will say that,

1540
01:10:55,541 --> 01:10:58,910
that I think sometimes it does.
It grates on you where you're like,

1541
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:00,170
hey man,
I do want to go to bed.

1542
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,353
You ever hear a kennison talk about when
he became famous and he would go to 

1543
01:11:04,881 --> 01:11:05,714
parties and they would go hit sam.
I think he goes and they lay out a 

1544
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:13,020
fucking line,
like lay out some like crazy protein.

1545
01:11:13,190 --> 01:11:14,010
And he would,
he would

1546
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:14,843
snort it and I forget how the bit wet,
but we've talked about like his heart 

1547
01:11:17,311 --> 01:11:19,500
was pounding out of his chest.
You can barely alive,

1548
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:21,270
but he didn't want to like let them 
down.

1549
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:22,290
Oh,
you know,

1550
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:24,110
it's a crazy thing that I get is that,
you know,

1551
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,040
people always want to do shots.
I don't like shots.

1552
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,980
And then book.
When I go to take a sip of a drink,

1553
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:31,740
I will drink my legit first drink.
When I do stand up,

1554
01:11:31,741 --> 01:11:33,630
when I tell the machine story on the 
second show,

1555
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,910
on the second show,
when I start that I go,

1556
01:11:35,911 --> 01:11:38,380
this is cruise control.
I'm going to have my cocktail start,

1557
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:39,533
I'm going to try to catch a buzz in the 
middle of the story and I saw I'll 

1558
01:11:41,341 --> 01:11:46,341
murder a double t doesn't soda and that,
but also to make them never drank during

1559
01:11:49,321 --> 01:11:54,321
a show or just telling the machine 
story.

1560
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:02,723
But uh,
but here's the tricky part of this 

1561
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:05,154
challenge is that we're doing the 
impractical jokers cruise on the first 

1562
01:12:08,131 --> 01:12:09,870
and sow.
When we started doing this,

1563
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:10,733
he went online.
He reached out to both of us and was 

1564
01:12:12,091 --> 01:12:12,301
like,
hey,

1565
01:12:12,301 --> 01:12:14,460
please don't do this for our cruise.
Why?

1566
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:15,503
Because there are guys that healthy.
They know there are guys that bought 

1567
01:12:18,030 --> 01:12:20,450
tickets to party with us.
He's taking for.

1568
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:21,900
He was like,
no more weed,

1569
01:12:21,901 --> 01:12:22,800
no more,
uh,

1570
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:24,180
uh,
tripping,

1571
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:25,890
you know.
Sorry,

1572
01:12:25,891 --> 01:12:27,000
I can't,
can't this time.

1573
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:31,340
So wait a minute,
you're on the first november.

1574
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:33,750
I see what you're saying.
October.

1575
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:36,660
Yeah.
But we'd have to fly one more time.

1576
01:12:36,661 --> 01:12:37,494
My last october.
My last day of the challenge will be on 

1577
01:12:39,331 --> 01:12:40,680
a fucking problem.
I'm going to spend.

1578
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:41,730
I don't know,
maybe you're not,

1579
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:45,060
but you can celebrate on the cruise 
first,

1580
01:12:45,061 --> 01:12:47,490
but I would be landing on halloween and 
new orleans.

1581
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,810
Halloween.
We were already big.

1582
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:50,940
That's what makes it a tough,
tough challenge.

1583
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:52,800
Scrap cam.
You cannot cheat it.

1584
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,073
Mechanical to scram camp camp.
This episode is brought to you by scrim 

1585
01:12:57,121 --> 01:12:58,620
town.
Might have come scram.

1586
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:01,100
A fucking heartbeat.
So by the way,

1587
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:02,370
ditches be lying.

1588
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:05,020
Colon,
andy,

1589
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:05,701
dick,
and middle of the night.

1590
01:13:05,701 --> 01:13:07,070
Hey yo.
How do you fund your screen?

1591
01:13:07,090 --> 01:13:08,670
Cameras.
So on halloween,

1592
01:13:08,671 --> 01:13:12,210
whenever it was lit up and you're going 
to the airport to go to new orleans into

1593
01:13:12,211 --> 01:13:14,730
the fucking harder darkness,
you're going to be able to survive.

1594
01:13:14,731 --> 01:13:16,320
You're not going to just say close 
enough.

1595
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:17,960
Nope.
It's got that script.

1596
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,320
Look,
let me tell you something about me.

1597
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:22,980
I promise you this long strand mickey 
mantle dna.

1598
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,900
Yeah,
I remember this shit.

1599
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,810
I still got it.
Dude.

1600
01:13:27,811 --> 01:13:32,400
He's in great shape.
Let's do this right now.

1601
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:33,263
Why can't we wait you right now?
Just pick me up and pick up buttons and 

1602
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:39,050
csf here and then look over our heads 
and see you're shorter.

1603
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:44,520
Shorter.
What does that mean?

1604
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:48,960
He said you like talking about something
completely different,

1605
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,410
like who's heavier?
He's heavier than you now.

1606
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,960
We're probably the same way.
We're going to your house after this.

1607
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,000
Yeah.
We'll get on your scale scale.

1608
01:13:57,030 --> 01:13:59,550
Please put that shit on.
Parents would love to see her script the

1609
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:04,551
fuck out of that.
I got to do go instagram live perhaps.

1610
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:07,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

1611
01:14:08,150 --> 01:14:09,540
Right now.
This is the people right now,

1612
01:14:09,541 --> 01:14:10,374
right now.
Super uncomfortable with their personal 

1613
01:14:11,501 --> 01:14:12,330
weight yesterday.

1614
01:14:12,330 --> 01:14:15,040
Dreaming at the three of us.
You guys are fat shaming,

1615
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:22,100
shaming,
shame.

1616
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:26,980
He changed my life were just,
it changed my life for the better.

1617
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:27,903
The back.
Can I tell you that the greatest thing 

1618
01:14:28,901 --> 01:14:33,790
about this weight loss in the running,
it's just putting on my shoes,

1619
01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:35,523
my shoes.

1620
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:41,960
So difficult.
What happened?

1621
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:02,880
You know what I've always thought 
though,

1622
01:15:02,881 --> 01:15:04,150
for real people

1623
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:08,380
and then lose all the weight.
They must have incredible leg muscles.

1624
01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:09,570
Dude.
Uh,

1625
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:10,570
what's,
what's um,

1626
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:12,063
what's,
uh,

1627
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:13,240
daniel tosh,
his best friend,

1628
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:15,760
eddie gosling.
Gosling.

1629
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,920
When we did a voiceover,
like a cartoon together something and we

1630
01:15:18,921 --> 01:15:22,660
were in the sound booth together and 
tosh is in the other room and I go,

1631
01:15:22,661 --> 01:15:23,760
uh,
come in at a,

1632
01:15:23,761 --> 01:15:26,050
you got fucking big calves.
And he's like,

1633
01:15:26,051 --> 01:15:26,360
yeah,
yeah,

1634
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,310
I know.
I said,

1635
01:15:27,311 --> 01:15:29,140
no,
you got like really big calves.

1636
01:15:29,141 --> 01:15:29,761
And he's like,
no,

1637
01:15:29,761 --> 01:15:30,600
I get that a lot.
And I go,

1638
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:31,443
no,
eddie likes,

1639
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:33,313
you've got.
And I see tashi is in the sound booth 

1640
01:15:34,351 --> 01:15:36,340
and he's laughing hysterically.
I go,

1641
01:15:36,341 --> 01:15:37,174
what is it?
And he goes,

1642
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:39,870
here's to be thrown her 80 pounds.
So that's why he's got a big calves.

1643
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,170
And I was like,
oh,

1644
01:15:41,190 --> 01:15:42,550
it's a good touch and pressure by the 
way.

1645
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:50,800
Three hundred 80 pounds.
Wow.

1646
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:53,223
So okay.
So you must have similar calf muscles 

1647
01:15:55,361 --> 01:15:56,170
then.
No,

1648
01:15:56,170 --> 01:15:57,340
it's not that big.
Beautiful.

1649
01:15:57,490 --> 01:15:59,110
Seventy five.
Scram.

1650
01:15:59,111 --> 01:16:02,080
Scram.
Continuous alcohol monitoring.

1651
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:03,583
I wonder if you could like,
do you think people play like role 

1652
01:16:06,491 --> 01:16:07,324
playing games with their spouses and 
they put those on if I catch you 

1653
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:14,440
drinking bitches,
I'm not drinking.

1654
01:16:14,441 --> 01:16:18,670
I don't drink at her gym machines.
Bullshit to machines.

1655
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:22,900
Reading is always correct.
You're a liar.

1656
01:16:22,990 --> 01:16:24,010
Wait,
that doesn't do.

1657
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:25,320
That sucked a dick.
Yeah.

1658
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:27,210
That doesn't play role playing game.
Yeah,

1659
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:27,870
exactly.
It's like,

1660
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:28,610
oh,
it's,

1661
01:16:28,610 --> 01:16:28,980
you know,
it's.

1662
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:32,980
I have girls who were those a pantyhose 
with the elastic band around the top.

1663
01:16:33,810 --> 01:16:36,730
Why is that not as hot with the way your
pantyhose are connected.

1664
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:37,600
Why is that not?
Yeah.

1665
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:39,040
I don't know,
but it is,

1666
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:40,390
right.
It doesn't make sense.

1667
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:41,433
Why is it hot?
A girl we're in garter belt is extra 

1668
01:16:44,351 --> 01:16:45,490
dirty.
I like.

1669
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:48,700
I like when you find something that you 
didn't know is dirty and then you see it

1670
01:16:48,701 --> 01:16:49,690
and you go,
that's new.

1671
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:50,830
My newest.
Or like,

1672
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,960
you know,
it's really sexy glasses.

1673
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:56,650
No chicken can't see that.
Good.

1674
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:04,030
But what's really good?

1675
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:12,650
Tell us what I want to grow.
Smells like shit.

1676
01:17:15,150 --> 01:17:20,150
What do you like man?
Tell her to shower and hates shower.

1677
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:21,560
No,
nothing.

1678
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:22,810
Come on.
No,

1679
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:23,630
I,
I,

1680
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:26,350
I,
what I did for the last point,

1681
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:29,330
I was like,
the last point I saw that really kind of

1682
01:17:29,331 --> 01:17:31,900
like register me in a new way and it was
like,

1683
01:17:31,901 --> 01:17:34,640
I was like,
it's this thing called the dancing bear.

1684
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:38,150
So what it is,
is a,

1685
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:39,520
what?
It,

1686
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,220
hold on,
we got to hear the whole story.

1687
01:17:41,221 --> 01:17:43,390
You don't start tearing it apart.
Uh,

1688
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:45,860
it's,
it's a foe bachelorette party.

1689
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,260
So they come in with a dancing bear.
He was dancing around,

1690
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,820
right?
And then he goes back and he comes out,

1691
01:17:49,821 --> 01:17:54,290
he's got a big dick and he's just.
And so does he get caught by accident?

1692
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:54,710
No,
no,

1693
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:55,011
no,
no.

1694
01:17:55,011 --> 01:17:56,570
So this is what turned me on though.

1695
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:57,633
What is,
he comes out and comes out and he's a 

1696
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:04,730
bachelor party but there's like 30 girls
so clearly it's like really big,

1697
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:08,780
right?
So clearly like clearly like a couple of

1698
01:18:08,781 --> 01:18:11,120
them porn stars that he's going to fuck 
because it's a porn.

1699
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:14,090
Do you think his dick was taught them?
Tom?

1700
01:18:14,910 --> 01:18:17,830
Probably his,
the rest of them are hired.

1701
01:18:17,831 --> 01:18:18,800
Just actresses.
They're not.

1702
01:18:18,801 --> 01:18:19,634
Porn started to pay that much.
But what turned me on was when he would 

1703
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:26,520
join in with one of the regulars like 
the and he just like,

1704
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:28,850
he's fucking this girl and this girl is 
like trying to like act.

1705
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,090
And he puts his finger in her mouth.
The look on her face when she went,

1706
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:33,440
oh,
I guess I'm in this.

1707
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:34,551
I was like,
dad,

1708
01:18:34,551 --> 01:18:35,950
I want something real.
Yeah,

1709
01:18:36,270 --> 01:18:39,050
so much.
So this one girl that wasn't supposed to

1710
01:18:39,051 --> 01:18:40,220
get fucked,
they got fucked,

1711
01:18:40,810 --> 01:18:41,240
get fucked.

1712
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,920
She just was like,
just sucked his finger.

1713
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:43,270
Yeah.
And,

1714
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:44,103
but,
but it was like regular girl regular 

1715
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,353
wasn't a poet and so all of a sudden.
But the look on her face and then she 

1716
01:18:50,121 --> 01:18:52,040
started sucking his finger and you're 
going,

1717
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:53,750
oh,
this is how a real girl does it.

1718
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:55,820
She was like,
nervous,

1719
01:18:55,821 --> 01:18:56,654
like are there cars right now?
Driving the whole thing I liked about 

1720
01:19:08,991 --> 01:19:09,824
down blouses,
downloading told you just pulled down 

1721
01:19:12,850 --> 01:19:15,150
someone's skirt.
Those videos were hilarious.

1722
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:19,790
They pants people to down blouse was his
videos of girls.

1723
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:20,713
I'm cleaning toilets in a loose fitting 
shirt with no bra and then talking to 

1724
01:19:24,621 --> 01:19:25,454
the camera about inane bullshit like 
your wife would all you're doing and 

1725
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:35,590
you're so.
It's real.

1726
01:19:36,650 --> 01:19:38,810
It's fucking real.
She's like,

1727
01:19:39,230 --> 01:19:40,063
hey,
we should probably get new trash cans 

1728
01:19:41,031 --> 01:19:41,864
and you're like,
you're watching it but you're seeing it 

1729
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:45,290
in the video.

1730
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:47,350
I'm watching and I'm nodding going,
yeah.

1731
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:50,480
What or whatever,
just to hint of tiddy today,

1732
01:19:50,570 --> 01:19:55,570
today we had to drain are above ground 
pool and a pool and so leanne,

1733
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:57,673
leanne and I were joking around the bed 
talking about this dream I had and then 

1734
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,390
she goes,
let's do this now because before it gets

1735
01:20:02,391 --> 01:20:04,790
hot and she goes,
I'm going to go put a bra on and I go or

1736
01:20:04,791 --> 01:20:06,770
don't and I'll do the whole thing by 
myself.

1737
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:09,570
Just that little fucking side boob 
action.

1738
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:12,000
You see?
I fucking love that.

1739
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:13,520
What she do,
she kept bra.

1740
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:14,680
If I drain the pool.
Wow.

1741
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:16,400
Look at you.
Then ran three miles,

1742
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:19,260
three miles,
three miles.

1743
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:20,633
Treadmills will you actually do run?
There's a trench out of the woodwork or 

1744
01:20:24,511 --> 01:20:26,850
something like

1745
01:20:29,470 --> 01:20:34,470
they're non motorized.
Treadmill is use those now.

1746
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:38,940
They use them in like legit strength and
conditioning centers.

1747
01:20:39,230 --> 01:20:40,063
They really take off my.
But this has resistance and it's built 

1748
01:20:43,161 --> 01:20:47,420
like a banana,
like so you're running on it so it's all

1749
01:20:47,421 --> 01:20:50,720
entirely on the actual motion of you 
pushing your body.

1750
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:51,554
Yeah,
that's it.

1751
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:55,370
They're pretty bad ass speeds.
Very interesting because the,

1752
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:57,470
you know,
the faster you run,

1753
01:20:57,471 --> 01:20:59,480
like physically run,
the faster it goes.

1754
01:20:59,481 --> 01:21:03,620
You push it,
push it up to keeping up with it.

1755
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:06,380
You're actually pushing it out.
So it's like a teleprompter.

1756
01:21:06,650 --> 01:21:07,250
No,
no,

1757
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:07,660
no,
no,

1758
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:09,040
no.
Like when you read a teleprompter,

1759
01:21:09,041 --> 01:21:10,540
it goes at your pace,
so if you read faster,

1760
01:21:10,541 --> 01:21:12,710
it goes faster.
If you read slower go slower

1761
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:13,713
mechanical thing like the,
the physical action of you running and 

1762
01:21:17,531 --> 01:21:18,364
pushing it because you're on the slope.
That's what makes it go fast so that 

1763
01:21:22,061 --> 01:21:22,840
you,
you don't,

1764
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:24,910
you don't have to worry about like 
keeping up with it.

1765
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:29,110
It keeps up with you and it's all a much
more natural stride.

1766
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:30,183
Then keeping up with something that's on
a mechanism that's having the belt feed 

1767
01:21:33,671 --> 01:21:34,504
towards you.
So this is what it looks like when 

1768
01:21:34,991 --> 01:21:35,824
you're running on these things.
See how as woodward is one step higher 

1769
01:21:39,731 --> 01:21:40,970
to increase your pace.
Like you're,

1770
01:21:40,971 --> 01:21:42,190
you're actually pushing it

1771
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:43,510
step higher to.
Yeah,

1772
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:47,750
I will say I will say in all honesty,
I know that we joke.

1773
01:21:48,110 --> 01:21:48,943
I will say I've been worried about the 
idea that running on a treadmill is not 

1774
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:54,080
just,
it's making my legs move at that rate.

1775
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,133
Well,
this is opposed to making my legs take 

1776
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:57,760
me sweating.
It's

1777
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,140
good,
it is good,

1778
01:21:59,141 --> 01:22:02,320
but you see how this guy's running.
How is the ball of his feet,

1779
01:22:02,321 --> 01:22:03,154
his landing?
It's because he's running on a slight 

1780
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:08,800
uphill slant and that's how you're 
supposed to land on your feet.

1781
01:22:09,070 --> 01:22:09,903
The body is designed to like almost lean
forward and you catch yourself on the 

1782
01:22:13,421 --> 01:22:16,120
ball of your feet.
Know how much money I don't know.

1783
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:20,050
When you're running on an uphill slant,
you're more likely to do that.

1784
01:22:20,110 --> 01:22:22,420
That's why I like this shit.
Are you serious?

1785
01:22:22,421 --> 01:22:24,490
Yeah sake.
It's not cheap,

1786
01:22:25,090 --> 01:22:25,923
but it's the name of it.
That's the way to running hills is the 

1787
01:22:29,231 --> 01:22:31,690
shit and if you live in a place where 
you can't run hills,

1788
01:22:31,691 --> 01:22:32,524
I get it,
but if you do live in a place that has 

1789
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:36,850
hills,
running hills is the shit man.

1790
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:40,420
It is fucking amazing for workout.
So if you run,

1791
01:22:40,570 --> 01:22:42,610
do like put a heart rate monitor on.

1792
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:47,080
Let yourself get jacked up to a certain 
heart rate when you get an and take your

1793
01:22:47,081 --> 01:22:47,914
time.
When you get down to 140 beats per 

1794
01:22:49,451 --> 01:22:50,860
minute,
start running again,

1795
01:22:51,070 --> 01:22:53,190
jack,
that fucker up again in one 90.

1796
01:22:53,410 --> 01:22:55,870
Go as far as you can.
Let it get down to 1:40.

1797
01:22:55,871 --> 01:22:57,880
And if you just keep doing that over and
over and over again,

1798
01:22:58,090 --> 01:23:02,080
you develop so you feel better,
your legs move better,

1799
01:23:02,081 --> 01:23:04,840
your feet are stronger.
The difference between like,

1800
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:08,290
like if you have the opportunity,
like we live in a place that has canyons

1801
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:09,153
everywhere,
there's fucking trails everywhere and 

1802
01:23:11,771 --> 01:23:15,520
they're all stupid shit.
Like runyon is steepest shit.

1803
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:18,430
If you can get to runyon and run up that
fucking thing,

1804
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:20,650
that's a phenomenal workout,
man.

1805
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:22,320
Fucking insane.
I will say this though,

1806
01:23:22,350 --> 01:23:23,790
and by the way,
and I have to say this,

1807
01:23:23,791 --> 01:23:24,624
I have to give a huge shout out to 
cameron hanes because when I really 

1808
01:23:27,451 --> 01:23:28,284
started doing all this was I think was 
when you met him and I and like grid 

1809
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:32,753
trying to get in shape and I hear his 
fucking mottoes and I'm sure he's 

1810
01:23:35,971 --> 01:23:37,550
probably said to himself,
you know,

1811
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:38,423
I should.
Whatever I hear his motto is a no one 

1812
01:23:40,201 --> 01:23:44,040
cares work harder.
Like I hear that when I run.

1813
01:23:44,041 --> 01:23:45,390
Sometimes it's inspiration.
Yeah,

1814
01:23:45,730 --> 01:23:46,563
but,
but I will say that like I sometimes I 

1815
01:23:48,451 --> 01:23:52,560
will say to people like myself who are 
not as good of shape of cameron hanes.

1816
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:53,973
Some models could be no one cares but 
don't get injured because that is a big 

1817
01:23:56,971 --> 01:23:58,740
problem with,
with running.

1818
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:00,330
It's so tough.
If he get.

1819
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:03,060
He got him to him.
He doesn't realize he got injured.

1820
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:05,010
Not just keeps going.
Not him,

1821
01:24:05,011 --> 01:24:05,844
but I mean like people who listen to his
inspiration because ricard sometimes 

1822
01:24:08,101 --> 01:24:09,030
I've been like,
oh,

1823
01:24:09,031 --> 01:24:11,520
I should not really try to kill myself 
because I actually

1824
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:15,950
can't measure yourself against that guy.
He runs a marathon a day.

1825
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:16,940
Do you think you'd be disappointed?

1826
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:19,090
Could not do a marathon?
You readily admitted it.

1827
01:24:19,150 --> 01:24:22,870
I think cameron.
I think if cameron hanes and I ran for a

1828
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:24,220
day,
I think he definitely say you could do a

1829
01:24:24,221 --> 01:24:25,720
marathon.
Why do you know him?

1830
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:27,790
I think

1831
01:24:27,790 --> 01:24:30,760
he would only be running with you for 
the first 30 or 40 meters.

1832
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,670
No,
he couldn't keep up with them to be this

1833
01:24:33,671 --> 01:24:34,504
preposterous conversation.
If you're talking to a man who's far in 

1834
01:24:37,841 --> 01:24:42,140
the distance is too great shape.
Guys.

1835
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:47,500
Guys who are in great shape,
I literally would go to his credit.

1836
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:54,490
He was like,
can we add that to the study?

1837
01:24:55,420 --> 01:25:00,420
We'll have 205 miles.
What was his first one?

1838
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,430
Hundred.
Oh,

1839
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:06,370
okay.
This is a different one.

1840
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:09,250
He's got a bunch of these disgusting 
feet photographs online.

1841
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:12,460
Love it of him losing toenails and shit.
Fucking love it.

1842
01:25:12,461 --> 01:25:13,294
So his last last year you ran 205 miles 
and this year he's prepping for 

1843
01:25:17,381 --> 01:25:18,214
something in october.
That's the first time they're doing it 

1844
01:25:20,341 --> 01:25:21,174
at 238 miles.
Have you ever asked him about the 

1845
01:25:23,621 --> 01:25:24,454
approach that he went from being,
let's say a guy in shape running to 

1846
01:25:27,611 --> 01:25:29,270
doing the 100 mile,
like how do you.

1847
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:33,430
Did he just start going like I'll start 
doing marathons and then tack on?

1848
01:25:33,530 --> 01:25:37,030
Maybe one of the first marathon he did 
was very difficult for sure,

1849
01:25:37,031 --> 01:25:39,190
but then he started running a more than 
one time.

1850
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:41,790
He beat lance armstrong and the boston 
marathon.

1851
01:25:41,791 --> 01:25:45,970
He beat lance armstrong.
Lance was running the boston marathon.

1852
01:25:47,670 --> 01:25:50,180
I actually started out as a runner.
This was.

1853
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:52,780
This was for real though.
Hey,

1854
01:25:52,781 --> 01:25:53,614
this is a good Question.
Was this before or after lance got in 

1855
01:25:55,781 --> 01:26:00,781
trouble like I really thought that 
that's so stupid,

1856
01:26:01,670 --> 01:26:02,503
so fast,

1857
01:26:04,990 --> 01:26:09,990
but he's one of the avengers are just 
really good at biking or am I wrong?

1858
01:26:17,430 --> 01:26:20,820
Someone believes audio statements

1859
01:26:23,810 --> 01:26:24,643
mentioning the bikers.
SUper important and then he started 

1860
01:26:30,321 --> 01:26:32,930
doing crazy ones.
Then he did a bunch oF 100.

1861
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:37,610
Last year he did the big foot 200,
whiCh is actually 205 miles.

1862
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:40,430
What the fuck was several thousand feet 
of elevation to.

1863
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:42,340
You're going up running through the 
mountains.

1864
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:47,330
Does he take breaks,
lance armstrong and that's not him?

1865
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:47,930
Yeah,
it is.

1866
01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:48,763
That's cameron who was all skinny.
Campbell's real skinny at one point in 

1867
01:26:50,661 --> 01:26:51,494
time.

1868
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:53,100
Fly.
My guess.

1869
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:53,953
Hold on.

1870
01:26:56,770 --> 01:26:58,970
terry.
Cam.

1871
01:26:59,910 --> 01:27:00,810
Cam.
Yeah,

1872
01:27:00,811 --> 01:27:02,520
that's cam.
Many moons ago.

1873
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:06,780
This thing is I wonder like coordination
of lance armstrong,

1874
01:27:06,781 --> 01:27:07,614
1008,
so it would have been right in the 

1875
01:27:09,310 --> 01:27:11,310
middle of lives.
That's right.

1876
01:27:11,311 --> 01:27:14,340
So that's.
He got posted to the girls.

1877
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:18,780
I wonder who's going to write it up.
lance armstrong.

1878
01:27:19,140 --> 01:27:20,190
Wow.
I wonder.

1879
01:27:20,191 --> 01:27:22,740
I wonder if maybe it was in his off 
season and he was cycling.

1880
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:26,610
Cycling off.
I wonder what.

1881
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:27,473
I wonder what kind of inspiration it was
for cameron to realize your friend with 

1882
01:27:31,081 --> 01:27:31,914
the camera is around the corner and I 
see lance armstrong of my sites and I 

1883
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:36,193
get a picture where I'm passing it to a 
fat chick at the fucking reservoir and 

1884
01:27:39,691 --> 01:27:41,550
you're like,
I'm going to pass her fucking.

1885
01:27:42,150 --> 01:27:47,150
I'm noT going to walk past her.
I'm going to run his dreams.

1886
01:27:47,191 --> 01:27:48,024
He runs out so people understand that 
you were talking about running the 

1887
01:27:49,591 --> 01:27:51,100
reservoir,
the reservoir.

1888
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:51,943
Everybody's like,
what the fuck are you having sex with a 

1889
01:27:56,251 --> 01:27:57,084
girl high school,
but wouldn't you think that like the 

1890
01:27:57,841 --> 01:27:58,674
people at home that don't live near 
reservoirs don't know that people run 

1891
01:28:00,751 --> 01:28:02,610
around reservoirs in la?
I didn't know.

1892
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:05,250
I didn't think that into it.
La has so little wildlife will like,

1893
01:28:05,251 --> 01:28:09,480
let's just run around a fucking big pool
pool.

1894
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:12,360
They call it the reservoir.
we're reading around it like assholes

1895
01:28:17,870 --> 01:28:22,380
that in the la river or the perfect fake
la.

1896
01:28:22,381 --> 01:28:26,730
Anybody with real fucking heard of it.
You see it.

1897
01:28:26,731 --> 01:28:28,170
You're like,
it's an underpass.

1898
01:28:28,210 --> 01:28:30,960
What are you talking about?
I remember like,

1899
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,930
what have you seen it in a big rainstorm
though?

1900
01:28:33,931 --> 01:28:36,780
And we'll pass going up hill and stopped
and you're like,

1901
01:28:36,930 --> 01:28:40,080
wow,
that's our river Colorado.

1902
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:40,730
ShuT your

1903
01:28:40,730 --> 01:28:43,250
water.
It's salt water runoff,

1904
01:28:43,330 --> 01:28:45,200
you know,
so nasty.

1905
01:28:45,230 --> 01:28:48,860
Did you ever see.
Look at that river full blast.

1906
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:51,380
It does get full blast sometimes when we
do need that.

1907
01:28:51,470 --> 01:28:52,303
Like last year,
last year got fucking crazy with the 

1908
01:28:55,011 --> 01:28:57,650
amount of water a lot too.
There was so much water.

1909
01:28:57,651 --> 01:29:00,620
It rained so hard for so many ways.
They lifted that drought.

1910
01:29:00,621 --> 01:29:02,010
Finally year we pulled us out

1911
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:02,843
of the drought else.
Was that early this year or early this 

1912
01:29:06,450 --> 01:29:07,900
year,
but here's the thing,

1913
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,420
you guys know about the salt and sea?
No,

1914
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:15,150
the salton sea was a place that they 
created by opening up the Colorado river

1915
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:16,073
and they literally made it a giant 
inland sea and it was good for a little 

1916
01:29:18,481 --> 01:29:20,700
while.
Excuse me.

1917
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:22,153
I was good for a little while until the 
runoff from all these farms from all 

1918
01:29:26,131 --> 01:29:28,350
this like giant,
large scale agriculture,

1919
01:29:28,351 --> 01:29:29,184
all the chemicals and all the pesticides
would get in the runoff and then it got 

1920
01:29:32,101 --> 01:29:35,970
into the water and poisoned to 
everything and this mass fish die offs.

1921
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:41,220
To the point where before this they were
calling it the inland riviera,

1922
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:42,083
like California is inland riviera and 
sonny bono used to go there and all 

1923
01:29:45,661 --> 01:29:49,980
these people used to party there and it 
was like this big resort location.

1924
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:51,053
Now there are beaches that there's so 
many dead fish bones that the white of 

1925
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:59,550
the beach sand is actually fish scale.

1926
01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:00,830
What's.
Yes,

1927
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:06,020
millions and millions of fish,
but there's still fish there and there's

1928
01:30:06,541 --> 01:30:09,330
still people there because it's an 
enormous piece of water.

1929
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:10,673
Look at that.
Those are all dead fish from this one 

1930
01:30:11,551 --> 01:30:12,384
place,
so they have these mass die offs where 

1931
01:30:13,771 --> 01:30:17,340
there's no oxygen in the water or 
pollutants in the water.

1932
01:30:17,341 --> 01:30:20,280
They have giant dead zones.
These fishes float up the surface,

1933
01:30:20,610 --> 01:30:23,190
but there's still people that fish in 
that water and there's still people that

1934
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:24,083
eat those fish and these communities 
around survivor fish do this amazing 

1935
01:30:28,621 --> 01:30:31,380
documentary on it.
I wish I could remember what it's called

1936
01:30:32,310 --> 01:30:36,160
val kilmer movie called solar,
but the documentaries,

1937
01:30:36,161 --> 01:30:36,994
the what's fascinating is they 
interviewed the people that live in the 

1938
01:30:38,851 --> 01:30:39,684
surrounding communities,
which are the remnants of what they 

1939
01:30:41,761 --> 01:30:44,490
thought was going to be people around 
the resorts.

1940
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:46,130
Dude,
it's so crazy.

1941
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:49,260
Plagues and pressures of assault and see
who produced that.

1942
01:30:49,261 --> 01:30:52,200
Somebody important produce that to John 
Waters.

1943
01:30:52,201 --> 01:30:53,160
That's right.
Yes.

1944
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:55,020
This is nArrated by John Waters.
Yeah.

1945
01:30:55,021 --> 01:30:57,470
That's the one saying,
dude,

1946
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:59,280
it's amazing.
SonnY bono,

1947
01:30:59,281 --> 01:31:00,114
before he died,
he wanted to develop some sort of 

1948
01:31:02,971 --> 01:31:03,804
desalinization,
like filtration system for the salt and 

1949
01:31:07,441 --> 01:31:08,550
sea to bring it back.
Yeah,

1950
01:31:08,551 --> 01:31:11,670
because he remembers what It was like 
when he was a kid and look how beautiful

1951
01:31:11,671 --> 01:31:14,010
that is.
One that John Waters movie,

1952
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:16,610
when they net,
when John Waters narrow this movie,

1953
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:21,150
you get to see the despair that's in the
community now.

1954
01:31:21,220 --> 01:31:23,790
It's really sad.
Back on screen.

1955
01:31:29,850 --> 01:31:31,260
Anyway.
What's it called again?

1956
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:37,670
Tom?
You could totally look like that guy.

1957
01:31:37,820 --> 01:31:42,820
probably by the way.
I got to give a shout out to tommy.

1958
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:46,970
That fucking mayor thing you did.
I don't know why that's not a tv show,

1959
01:31:47,650 --> 01:31:50,760
but it's so funny you ever see that?
Tom's got a mayor,

1960
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:52,490
cincinnati,
uh,

1961
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:53,453
detroit youtube because she just didn't 
fucking short film where he's just is 

1962
01:31:57,871 --> 01:32:00,040
fucking hilarious of play.
This.

1963
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:02,760
Is that martin who's.
Is this?

1964
01:32:03,730 --> 01:32:05,260
No,
I didn't pay for it.

1965
01:32:05,261 --> 01:32:05,621
No,
no.

1966
01:32:05,621 --> 01:32:08,470
It was the video stuff.
You want to get us pulled?

1967
01:32:08,471 --> 01:32:08,690
No,
no,

1968
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:09,550
no,
no.

1969
01:32:09,570 --> 01:32:10,390
I,
I can.

1970
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:11,840
You can put.
You can play it short.

1971
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:13,451
Wait,
wait,

1972
01:32:13,451 --> 01:32:15,100
wait.
back up.

1973
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:16,233
Commissioner gordon's on his way over 
batman telling me that's not the reason 

1974
01:32:22,241 --> 01:32:23,050
you picked him.
Look,

1975
01:32:23,050 --> 01:32:23,883
when there's five candidates for police 
commissioner and one of them's named 

1976
01:32:26,231 --> 01:32:27,064
gordon,
your decision suddenly becomes very 

1977
01:32:28,781 --> 01:32:29,614
easy.
Commissioner gordon is a video of you 

1978
01:32:34,001 --> 01:32:36,210
smoking crack out.
Okay.

1979
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:37,673
Crack had went to $100,000.
Should be mandatory in school that we 

1980
01:32:51,550 --> 01:32:52,383
weren't able to sneak the word crack in 
a few more to like that guy from 

1981
01:33:01,001 --> 01:33:02,630
toronto.
Oh yeah.

1982
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:04,300
Yeah.
And then they actually,

1983
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:08,670
we made this little while ago and then 
they actually did a feature about it,

1984
01:33:08,910 --> 01:33:09,743
like were they straight up?
Just did it on him like very much like 

1985
01:33:11,651 --> 01:33:12,490
this.
Oh really?

1986
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:15,790
Yeah.
That was a character and a half man that

1987
01:33:15,791 --> 01:33:17,790
he was wild.
You ever see what he got locked up?

1988
01:33:17,810 --> 01:33:20,350
He was talking about fighting people 
that he was like Mike Tyson.

1989
01:33:21,810 --> 01:33:26,470
We liked a lot his when he did it at 
town hall.

1990
01:33:26,860 --> 01:33:27,760
And he's like,
no,

1991
01:33:28,290 --> 01:33:30,820
and it's like a midday pressing in those
wonderful.

1992
01:33:30,821 --> 01:33:31,654
And they're like,
uh,

1993
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:32,733
just ask you.
They didn't ask him specifically about 

1994
01:33:33,431 --> 01:33:33,731
this.
He goes,

1995
01:33:33,731 --> 01:33:36,490
and by the way,
lady,

1996
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:39,750
I'm going to eat her pussy.
He goes,

1997
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:44,780
I get plentY of that back at home 
camera.

1998
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:48,690
Oh shit.

1999
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:55,470
It's.
I have to take legal aCtion.

2000
01:33:56,590 --> 01:33:59,580
Don't appreciate people home atlanta,
a prostitute,

2001
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:03,510
prostitute here.
I'm very happily married at home.

2002
01:34:04,570 --> 01:34:08,310
That's very disturbing against my wife.
Unfortunately.

2003
01:34:08,311 --> 01:34:09,720
I have to take legal action against 
size,

2004
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:14,080
the grants and the ga stock lists and 
mark two.

2005
01:34:14,090 --> 01:34:17,070
We have to take legal action against the
winter.

2006
01:34:17,071 --> 01:34:19,620
That said,
I was doing lines at the beer market.

2007
01:34:19,690 --> 01:34:20,210
That is.
Oh,

2008
01:34:20,210 --> 01:34:21,960
great lies.
That is not true.

2009
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:27,810
My wife not.
They're calling a friend of mine,

2010
01:34:28,050 --> 01:34:30,660
a prostitute.
Atlanta is not a prostitute.

2011
01:34:30,810 --> 01:34:34,860
She's a friend and it makes me sick.
People are saying this,

2012
01:34:35,010 --> 01:34:37,710
but unfortunately I have no other 
choice.

2013
01:34:38,010 --> 01:34:40,900
I'm allowed to take legal action.
I can't.

2014
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:42,093
I can't put up with it anymore,
so I'm litigational you starting 

2015
01:34:45,861 --> 01:34:47,370
shortly.
I've had enough.

2016
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,800
I warned you guys yesterday.
Be careful what you wrote.

2017
01:34:50,220 --> 01:34:52,560
Okay,
so that's all I have to save for now.

2018
01:34:52,830 --> 01:34:55,040
And the next thing I want to call 
America tanja,

2019
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:58,040
it's in hamilton and tell that we're 
going to have to

2020
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:00,170
spank their little tiger cats.
oh.

2021
01:35:00,180 --> 01:35:03,420
The last thing was olivia gone back to 
the sentence.

2022
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:07,370
I Wanted to eat her pussy.
Like never said that in my life.

2023
01:35:07,630 --> 01:35:11,030
I would never do that.
I've got more than enough at home.

2024
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:18,480
Drop by drop greatest fucking time.
He died and there was no like,

2025
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:25,420
like there was no coverage of,
of that.

2026
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:30,760
He died.
So there was a really sad.

2027
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:37,840
He came to the store once we finished 
with everybody.

2028
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:38,760
Yeah,
it was great.

2029
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:44,500
I wish I met him.
He was the mayor of toronto biggest city

2030
01:35:45,171 --> 01:35:46,980
in Canada.
Super recently.

2031
01:35:46,981 --> 01:35:47,814
Huh?

2032
01:35:48,250 --> 01:35:52,230
He was doing wild shit all the time.
That guy was that.

2033
01:35:52,231 --> 01:35:55,290
And brexit were to like,
if you look at history,

2034
01:35:55,590 --> 01:35:57,390
if you go back and look at like the rain
of trump,

2035
01:35:57,391 --> 01:36:00,480
like when trump became president and you
look at that and brexit,

2036
01:36:00,481 --> 01:36:03,820
like those two things happening,
that opens the door.

2037
01:36:05,670 --> 01:36:06,503
Well,
anything almost can happen given the 

2038
01:36:08,851 --> 01:36:11,820
right set of circumstances,
given people getting cocky,

2039
01:36:12,030 --> 01:36:14,850
someone thinking they're way more 
appealing than they actually are.

2040
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:17,400
Looking at an alternative,
someone's charismatic,

2041
01:36:17,401 --> 01:36:20,370
they jump in and they can be crazy.
Let's take a chance with them.

2042
01:36:20,371 --> 01:36:21,204
Let's take a chance.
It's the small town politicians getting 

2043
01:36:22,711 --> 01:36:23,544
big.
You know the best thing about the 

2044
01:36:27,330 --> 01:36:28,163
current chaos politically,
I think people need to understand that 

2045
01:36:32,071 --> 01:36:32,904
this can happen.
Do you think about how like I know some 

2046
01:36:35,341 --> 01:36:39,810
of it is just pr stuff like how 20,
20 might shape up,

2047
01:36:40,110 --> 01:36:40,943
at least with.

2048
01:36:41,220 --> 01:36:44,490
It could possibly be celebrities.
We'd like To do this too.

2049
01:36:44,580 --> 01:36:45,413
It could easily look.
Donald trump is obviously he's got a 

2050
01:36:49,291 --> 01:36:52,760
long history of being successful at,
you know,

2051
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:56,200
being a television host.
So from a guy who's a.

2052
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:58,470
Yeah,
it was a great interview on a talk show,

2053
01:36:58,620 --> 01:36:59,453
so long history of knowing how to kind 
of work the crowd in a certain way and 

2054
01:37:02,321 --> 01:37:06,300
do it only makes sense that someone like
that eventually get in to what I said.

2055
01:37:06,330 --> 01:37:07,350
The way I described it,
I was like,

2056
01:37:07,710 --> 01:37:12,030
you had a popularity contest and it 
actually popular person entered.

2057
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:13,410
Yeah,
that's the difference.

2058
01:37:13,740 --> 01:37:14,573
like most of these guys are popular for 
politicians and here was this guy who's 

2059
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:19,960
popular period.
Yeah,

2060
01:37:20,190 --> 01:37:21,023
and he's way better talKing to them and 
we were arguing way better at being 

2061
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:25,193
under the gun.
Like when those like little hot moments 

2062
01:37:27,241 --> 01:37:28,740
with him and you know,
all the,

2063
01:37:28,741 --> 01:37:31,380
all the different candidates.
He comes up with nicknames for him.

2064
01:37:31,381 --> 01:37:35,550
Like the whole thing was kind of genius,
like chopped them all down and then made

2065
01:37:35,551 --> 01:37:37,290
it through.
But now you realize like,

2066
01:37:37,291 --> 01:37:38,124
hey,
probably nobody should be doing that 

2067
01:37:40,351 --> 01:37:41,184
job.
It's probably too big of a job for any 

2068
01:37:42,961 --> 01:37:44,570
one human being.
You know,

2069
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:48,330
and this guy's doing it and he's doing 
it because he won a popularity contest.

2070
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:51,020
That's crazy because then you're gonna 
have the rock.

2071
01:37:51,270 --> 01:37:54,260
He's going to do it.
What I'm saying wrong,

2072
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:56,040
you're not talking about the qualified 
people by

2073
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:56,873
any stretch of the imagination.
You talked about the people that people 

2074
01:37:58,921 --> 01:38:01,950
liked the most.
It's willing to be the rock,

2075
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:02,933
not when.
So many in so many non-regular like 

2076
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:08,820
people who can vote that don't.
I'll be like,

2077
01:38:08,850 --> 01:38:10,960
I'm going to vote.
Although for Iraq,

2078
01:38:11,070 --> 01:38:13,610
no way.
That's ridiculous.

2079
01:38:14,250 --> 01:38:19,250
Would win because people think together.
No one thinks that'd be great together.

2080
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:22,920
Shit.
Get on that introduction.

2081
01:38:23,180 --> 01:38:27,840
Ship.
Jesus presidents.

2082
01:38:28,510 --> 01:38:31,110
How about stop this fucking president.
Vice president.

2083
01:38:31,111 --> 01:38:33,630
How about you have to co presidents.
We have a new system.

2084
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:34,793
The rockin.
Oprah taking over whole solar system 

2085
01:38:38,481 --> 01:38:39,314
will realign the interesting.
It's not a bad idea why people would be 

2086
01:38:42,721 --> 01:38:44,190
furious.
Yeah.

2087
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:44,821
No,
I don't think.

2088
01:38:44,821 --> 01:38:49,460
I don't think white people think that no
one is.

2089
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:50,680
Why the rocks white?
No.

2090
01:38:50,681 --> 01:38:54,390
He said why in man not black.
He's blaCk.

2091
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:57,600
Claimed by whites.
He's gigantic.

2092
01:38:57,601 --> 01:38:58,434
He's barely a regular person.
You're saying that white people would 

2093
01:39:01,770 --> 01:39:04,490
athlete might be able to.
The white people love the rock.

2094
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:06,720
Why do people claim?
Because the rock.

2095
01:39:06,950 --> 01:39:09,610
You remember when the rock,
you're a twat moving the rock.

2096
01:39:09,660 --> 01:39:11,040
Give me a shout out.
Yeah.

2097
01:39:11,041 --> 01:39:16,041
He was like super Fat does not make it 
all.

2098
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:25,020
That was great because he brought up two
days.

2099
01:39:25,060 --> 01:39:25,860
He was like,
look,

2100
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:27,780
two days,
fucking high school.

2101
01:39:28,830 --> 01:39:30,000
But you never did two days.
He goes,

2102
01:39:30,020 --> 01:39:30,390
no,
no.

2103
01:39:30,390 --> 01:39:33,330
play baseball.
Choose wisely.

2104
01:39:33,331 --> 01:39:34,164
Cim.
Bert,

2105
01:39:35,430 --> 01:39:36,610
bert.
Oh this for the bet.

2106
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:40,350
This was back back.
How'd that turn out?

2107
01:39:41,430 --> 01:39:42,263
Tom?
One.

2108
01:39:42,690 --> 01:39:43,523
Tom,
be burt.

2109
01:39:43,530 --> 01:39:46,290
Weird.
Let's team up that mickey mantle.

2110
01:39:46,291 --> 01:39:47,970
Shit.
You were close though.

2111
01:39:47,971 --> 01:39:48,804
You were close.
I think I did much better than anyone 

2112
01:39:51,151 --> 01:39:53,520
expected.
Oh yeah.

2113
01:39:53,610 --> 01:39:57,630
Both you.
Did you expect to win?

2114
01:39:58,680 --> 01:39:59,513
I,
no.

2115
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:04,110
Did you not expect to win at Some point 
when?

2116
01:40:04,111 --> 01:40:04,944
When,
uh,

2117
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:09,740
I think we were talking on the phone one
night and you realize and I,

2118
01:40:09,741 --> 01:40:11,460
and I was having a hard time dropping 
weight.

2119
01:40:11,930 --> 01:40:12,763
Weren't working out.
You're eating like crazy and drinking a 

2120
01:40:14,271 --> 01:40:15,104
lot.
Yeah,

2121
01:40:15,190 --> 01:40:16,320
those are all facts.
Whatever,

2122
01:40:16,321 --> 01:40:21,321
whatever pain as well as food,
food a lot.

2123
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:26,070
So emotions and everything for a couple 
extra miles.

2124
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:29,820
What your jam takedown around.
They're googling what is the calories of

2125
01:40:29,821 --> 01:40:30,654
one wendy's double double weight.
So when we talking about the amount of 

2126
01:40:34,081 --> 01:40:35,250
calories at a wendy's double,
double,

2127
01:40:37,050 --> 01:40:39,360
double cheeseburger or run for two 
hours,

2128
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:41,133
total bird thought he was pulled out of 
his brain on top of the pot roast the 

2129
01:40:45,991 --> 01:40:49,140
night before.
IT's crazy bro,

2130
01:40:49,290 --> 01:40:50,910
but I still was.
I still did.

2131
01:40:50,911 --> 01:40:52,260
Good.
You did good.

2132
01:40:52,261 --> 01:40:54,460
But when did you think.
When did you not think you were?

2133
01:40:54,461 --> 01:40:55,294
Actually I was sitting in my bathroom 
and I was talking on the phone and you 

2134
01:40:57,911 --> 01:41:01,480
were saying something like you were 
talking about your diet and I was like,

2135
01:41:01,481 --> 01:41:03,850
my diet is Just not eat over a thousand 
calories.

2136
01:41:04,030 --> 01:41:06,970
Like I'm not thinking about what I'm 
putting in my mouth per day.

2137
01:41:06,971 --> 01:41:09,070
You ate less than 1000 calories?
No,

2138
01:41:09,230 --> 01:41:10,063
no,
no,

2139
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:12,470
no,
no way.

2140
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:13,570
No.
Okay.

2141
01:41:13,570 --> 01:41:14,140
Okay.
Okay.

2142
01:41:14,140 --> 01:41:15,670
I'm not a fucking doctor.
Whatever.

2143
01:41:15,671 --> 01:41:20,671
I had sense.
Obviously I lost fucking 40 pounds in 30

2144
01:41:23,231 --> 01:41:24,550
days.
I lost fortY pounds.

2145
01:41:24,551 --> 01:41:25,900
Correct?
Yes.

2146
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:28,120
It's so crazy.
A lot of calories.

2147
01:41:28,121 --> 01:41:30,100
I don't know what it was.
SUper healthy by the way.

2148
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:32,830
It's definitely the way you did it,
man.

2149
01:41:32,831 --> 01:41:34,390
You got under obese.
That was great.

2150
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:35,253
Yeah.
I was just trying to show my mickey 

2151
01:41:37,481 --> 01:41:41,320
mantle gene and when I did my calories I
stopped.

2152
01:41:41,321 --> 01:41:42,154
I didn't drink a bond.
How mUch weight does your cut like two 

2153
01:41:43,631 --> 01:41:45,820
days beFore that time.
Like how muCh do you not drink at all?

2154
01:41:46,430 --> 01:41:48,580
Well,
we both cut water the same days,

2155
01:41:48,700 --> 01:41:53,620
the day drinking the night before for 
salty foods.

2156
01:41:54,130 --> 01:41:59,130
Water technically started to do like a 
watercolor version of 24 hours before.

2157
01:41:59,410 --> 01:42:00,243
That's great,
and then when yOu had to go to the 

2158
01:42:00,701 --> 01:42:02,180
secoNd day,
that was way harder,

2159
01:42:02,181 --> 01:42:03,014
man.
He didn't have a drop of water the 

2160
01:42:04,970 --> 01:42:05,803
entire next day and then went to a 
fucking sauna that morning and I was 

2161
01:42:09,731 --> 01:42:10,564
like really unhealthy thing that we were
doing was we were making it a weight 

2162
01:42:13,751 --> 01:42:16,620
loss thing instead of making it a body 
fat set.

2163
01:42:16,660 --> 01:42:17,560
It's true.
We could have,

2164
01:42:18,190 --> 01:42:19,023
if we were smart,
what we've done is a dunk tank have so 

2165
01:42:21,330 --> 01:42:25,400
place that does a dunk tank where they 
check your body composition because they

2166
01:42:25,410 --> 01:42:26,243
could do that electrical one.
We hold These cables and you push your 

2167
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:31,000
hands on them and it.
It's pretty good there.

2168
01:42:31,001 --> 01:42:31,834
Read through your feet to body fat.
There's a bunch of different kinds of 

2169
01:42:35,471 --> 01:42:36,890
these things.
This wAs the easiest way.

2170
01:42:37,530 --> 01:42:39,670
Weight loss,
weight loss is both.

2171
01:42:39,671 --> 01:42:40,504
These guys came into this thing like 
with a fake weight loss because they 

2172
01:42:42,591 --> 01:42:43,424
dehydrated themselves.
Birgit and he of salty food and drink a 

2173
01:42:45,701 --> 01:42:46,820
lot.
Definitely the high.

2174
01:42:46,900 --> 01:42:48,070
Definitely.
I definitely did not.

2175
01:42:48,090 --> 01:42:52,690
The last day I was thirsty as fuck.
A really hard time not drinking water.

2176
01:42:52,691 --> 01:42:53,524
Before I got here,
tommy drank nine bottles of water as 

2177
01:42:56,681 --> 01:42:59,720
soon as your entire podcast during the.
No.

2178
01:42:59,850 --> 01:43:02,840
Do we kept giving them bottles.
Water thrown them like a fight.

2179
01:43:04,090 --> 01:43:04,923
Do you remember what the number was?
I remember we calculated it was over a 

2180
01:43:07,151 --> 01:43:12,150
gallon of water back.
Can I count you?

2181
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:15,550
Made not obese like point one five of an
inch.

2182
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:20,110
That's how close it was.
Great by.

2183
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:22,420
That's where you got to like keep going 
for it.

2184
01:43:22,670 --> 01:43:24,850
swaying how tall you are versus how much
you weigh,

2185
01:43:24,910 --> 01:43:29,910
but that's just bmi modified once and 
they want to actually do a way to modify

2186
01:43:31,250 --> 01:43:32,680
that and condom.
Yeah.

2187
01:43:32,870 --> 01:43:36,680
To me for a second,
that guy.

2188
01:43:38,510 --> 01:43:42,880
That guy is crazy.

2189
01:43:46,860 --> 01:43:51,860
The way people listen.
If you're listening to this,

2190
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:57,170
google that google image,
search barker fraud,

2191
01:43:57,240 --> 01:43:58,073
comedian bark chrysler,
keeping it low in those after his loss 

2192
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:04,130
against undisputed water champion tommy 
buns.

2193
01:44:04,190 --> 01:44:08,540
Segora.
You're surrounded by genius.

2194
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:13,750
Photoshop fried chicken faces from a 
spike,

2195
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:22,053
a spike video games award,
and I shaved clean and I saw the photos 

2196
01:44:26,150 --> 01:44:31,150
from the red carpet and I was like,
good luck to nicotine patches on funny.

2197
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:35,060
That is so funny and no one has seen all
the booze.

2198
01:44:35,061 --> 01:44:37,960
Right?
That is a great phOto shop.

2199
01:44:38,180 --> 01:44:40,220
She looks so happy with those doNuts.
You know?

2200
01:44:40,221 --> 01:44:41,054
That's the thing about the internet.
That can be some dude who has some 

2201
01:44:43,461 --> 01:44:47,030
regular Jobs somewhere.
This board downtown,

2202
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:47,953
a downtime on his computer.
He just creates that and throws it up 

2203
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:53,300
and there's people out there that like.
It's a secret,

2204
01:44:53,301 --> 01:44:55,670
but it's not a secret about guys like 
us,

2205
01:44:55,671 --> 01:44:56,420
like what we do.

2206
01:44:56,420 --> 01:44:58,460
There's a lot of guys you could have 
done whaT we did.

2207
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:02,540
How about how good are some of these 
guys making posters and like drawing.

2208
01:45:02,860 --> 01:45:06,460
My guy,
my guy is fuckiNg brett brock.

2209
01:45:06,510 --> 01:45:09,230
He is.
He is legit.

2210
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:13,070
Like a very nice dude.
But man,

2211
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:16,240
those posters,

He's really good.
Amazing.

01:45:30,710 --> 01:45:32,270
Just great shit.
Hilarious.

2221
01:45:32,420 --> 01:45:35,810
Some of them are really just for the 
podcast.

2222
01:45:35,890 --> 01:45:39,770
Yeah.
That guy from drastic effects.

2223
01:45:39,771 --> 01:45:44,771
He does some awesome shit.
You see the run dmc one for 1000 tasks.

2224
01:45:45,950 --> 01:45:47,480
YeAh.
That was so great.

2225
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:49,453
So fUn.
That show what ge diaz made me laugh 

2226
01:45:52,491 --> 01:45:54,500
harder than any human being has ever 
made me laugh.

2227
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:57,260
We had to look down.
I looked up and tommy,

2228
01:45:57,261 --> 01:46:01,970
he was looking at the Floor too.
We were both looking at the floor and he

2229
01:46:01,971 --> 01:46:04,400
was suCking all the oxygen out of the 
room.

2230
01:46:04,650 --> 01:46:05,720
His.
He was killing.

2231
01:46:05,721 --> 01:46:06,554
So track was a way to breathe.
I lost track of what he was saying one 

2232
01:46:09,111 --> 01:46:10,580
point because I just stopped listening 
to him.

2233
01:46:13,340 --> 01:46:17,990
He's on fire right now.
I was really excited for that podcast,

2234
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:19,320
dude.
It was fun.

2235
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:25,470
It was easy for you to turn around and 
start over.

2236
01:46:25,490 --> 01:46:26,450
Wait,
great.

2237
01:46:26,490 --> 01:46:28,540
So can we go back to this profile?
What is this bet.

2238
01:46:28,750 --> 01:46:29,583
So what do you think you could do now 
that you're sober for fucking 10 

2239
01:46:33,381 --> 01:46:34,214
minutes?
What do you think you could do your 

2240
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:36,440
october.
We're signing up,

2241
01:46:36,441 --> 01:46:39,470
right?
So 30 days.

2242
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:41,210
Okay.
You want to do 30 days?

2243
01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:44,090
Thirty one days.
Thirty one days.

2244
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:50,880
October,
october this from midnight at,

2245
01:46:50,930 --> 01:46:51,511
at,
uh,

2246
01:46:51,511 --> 01:46:53,850
on the west coast time.
Wherever you are,

2247
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:58,880
what are you casting a spell I need to 
send the moon is full right up to 1159.

2248
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:05,393
Of course he is going to be.
He's going to be passed out drunk at 

2249
01:47:06,871 --> 01:47:09,570
1159,
but no boobs call through the valley.

2250
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:12,070
Of course he is.
Hold on one.

2251
01:47:12,210 --> 01:47:14,130
Disappoint your children.
Hang on.

2252
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:14,993
How can I make this so that I'm going to
challenge where I don't feel like 

2253
01:47:16,411 --> 01:47:17,760
everyone's against me.
Know what it's like.

2254
01:47:17,761 --> 01:47:22,761
It's like the ultimate holds.
Their breath lot will quit.

2255
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:24,073
And for You to lose your home when 
you're like a guy who's ready to break 

2256
01:47:30,061 --> 01:47:33,060
the world record and hold your breath.
You know you're going to breathe again,

2257
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:35,260
but it's going to be.
Yeah,

2258
01:47:35,510 --> 01:47:36,343
it's going to be a long time.
I think of how much fun that will be on 

2259
01:47:38,341 --> 01:47:39,750
november,
but you're not thinking.

2260
01:47:39,751 --> 01:47:40,800
You're not thinking,
hey man,

2261
01:47:40,801 --> 01:47:43,960
maybe I shoulD just stop drinking.
Think about,

2262
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:46,830
think about October 1st at 12:30
AM when you're like,

2263
01:47:46,890 --> 01:47:47,723
I'm the fucking fuck that.
Give me another drink and you fail 

2264
01:47:49,741 --> 01:47:51,340
instantly.
Think about that.

2265
01:47:51,740 --> 01:47:52,830
Is that in two?
No,

2266
01:47:52,831 --> 01:47:54,610
no,
that's not even one day.

2267
01:47:54,660 --> 01:47:55,493
Thirty minutes.
There was 30 minutes and in my scenario 

2268
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:01,860
I assume there are people are out in the
party for five or six days before things

2269
01:48:01,861 --> 01:48:03,330
start getting really weird.

2270
01:48:03,510 --> 01:48:08,280
Scram cam come to.
First of all,

2271
01:48:08,281 --> 01:48:11,790
I think your marijuana intake would up 
tick.

2272
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:13,561
Can I say?
Yeah,

2273
01:48:13,561 --> 01:48:17,430
you can get high for a month.
Say it's a little bomb bomb.

2274
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:19,920
A little bullshit that you would go to 
marijuana because all that stuff.

2275
01:48:19,990 --> 01:48:22,130
Normally I'd say that's way healthier,
but I'm sayinG here,

2276
01:48:22,220 --> 01:48:25,740
all that's doing is writing you the gap 
until you can drink again.

2277
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:26,650
By the way,
I'll go no matter what.

2278
01:48:26,670 --> 01:48:29,580
I would like you to face sobriety.
That's interesting.

2279
01:48:29,610 --> 01:48:29,970
Look,
look,

2280
01:48:29,970 --> 01:48:34,820
I don't have no problem being on the 
road with you and have him bombed.

2281
01:48:34,821 --> 01:48:39,821
So you look like a hero.
He was the only sober.

2282
01:48:40,171 --> 01:48:42,830
I can totally do.
Much better than if I was hammering some

2283
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:47,960
next level of three d chess.
I think you're hilarious when you drunk.

2284
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:51,050
I'm you.
You've never seen.

2285
01:48:51,260 --> 01:48:53,540
You've never seen me wait.
No,

2286
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:53,880
you're right.

2287
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:54,713
You have.
You have yet.

2288
01:48:55,090 --> 01:48:57,870
You know,
you saw me on stage the first time I was

2289
01:48:57,880 --> 01:49:00,870
ever high onstage.
Drunk his fucking at the ice house.

2290
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:06,160
I forgot about that.
I don't drink black out about the time.

2291
01:49:07,690 --> 01:49:10,650
Did that.
Oh hey,

2292
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:14,190
by the way,
who's in town?

2293
01:49:14,191 --> 01:49:15,870
Wednesday?
Wednesday.

2294
01:49:15,871 --> 01:49:18,150
You guys want to do the ice house for 
Singapore?

2295
01:49:18,390 --> 01:49:19,240
No,
no,

2296
01:49:19,260 --> 01:49:20,093
no,
no.

2297
01:49:20,990 --> 01:49:25,030
Could have been a good god damn time.
I would love god.

2298
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:28,240
Damn,
that's how I booked the ice house.

2299
01:49:28,290 --> 01:49:30,360
It's cool.
I'm super organized.

2300
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:34,200
So 31 days,
80 days?

2301
01:49:35,010 --> 01:49:38,780
No nothing.
No bad days and yup.

2302
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:44,990
Days of 40 days of yoga in that time.
No,

2303
01:49:46,230 --> 01:49:47,550
you can't do that.
No,

2304
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:48,393
I'll tell you.
Just negotiating like an agent right 

2305
01:49:49,181 --> 01:49:49,660
now.
Hold on,

2306
01:49:49,660 --> 01:49:52,060
hold on one second.
I will tell you why I can't do that.

2307
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:54,250
[inaudible].
I don't want to lose who the fuck I am,

2308
01:49:54,340 --> 01:49:55,330
which is I like to.

2309
01:49:55,330 --> 01:50:00,330
I like to as is obesity truth bro.
You.

2310
01:50:01,570 --> 01:50:04,030
You're saying you don't want to lose the
party man image.

2311
01:50:04,270 --> 01:50:06,250
I will not go to that impractical 
jokers.

2312
01:50:06,251 --> 01:50:07,084
Cruise with big j are all those comics 
that I love and not trying to not drink 

2313
01:50:10,830 --> 01:50:11,531
it.
That's just silly.

2314
01:50:11,531 --> 01:50:13,770
I'm a grownup.
I also make a lot of money by don't need

2315
01:50:13,780 --> 01:50:14,613
to do the bed,
but I wanted to do the bet because I 

2316
01:50:16,151 --> 01:50:17,830
like the idea of the bet.
OkAy.

2317
01:50:18,490 --> 01:50:19,323
But I think 30 days,
31 days in october to start model 

2318
01:50:23,290 --> 01:50:25,390
sobriety and totally,
totally.

2319
01:50:26,740 --> 01:50:31,740
Can I get some mics in the world police 
when they get extra fuck scenes dude.

2320
01:50:33,221 --> 01:50:35,590
Shit on the girl's chest.
Just shit on him and pissed on.

2321
01:50:35,700 --> 01:50:38,260
Yeah.
Did that so they can cut other things.

2322
01:50:38,820 --> 01:50:40,240
I say this,
you can get done with you.

2323
01:50:40,241 --> 01:50:44,050
You can get those chalk pills that help 
you deal with withdrawal chalk.

2324
01:50:44,110 --> 01:50:45,690
no,
I don't need you.

2325
01:50:45,691 --> 01:50:46,524
Will you?
When you got the shakes withdrawing or 

2326
01:50:50,260 --> 01:50:54,070
I'll call these guys guys buy this truck
pills.

2327
01:50:54,130 --> 01:50:54,963
Chalk?
Yeah.

2328
01:50:55,530 --> 01:50:58,390
I don't need whole charcoal.
Charcoal.

2329
01:50:58,391 --> 01:51:00,760
Charcoal.
Throw up.

2330
01:51:00,870 --> 01:51:02,770
Yeah,
but waiting because you're not gonna get

2331
01:51:02,771 --> 01:51:03,604
high off that.
She's going to save your life because 

2332
01:51:04,331 --> 01:51:06,400
you will die otherwise because you're 
unequipped to do this.

2333
01:51:06,490 --> 01:51:07,323
But do you remember the article I sent 
you should write a well beforehand and 

2334
01:51:11,111 --> 01:51:11,944
that was the article we read about.
You said that it's really not 

2335
01:51:17,801 --> 01:51:18,634
recommended to Just quit cold Turkey.
Like you should start now and get ready 

2336
01:51:21,850 --> 01:51:24,460
or or you know what?
I'm going to write my eulogy with you in

2337
01:51:24,461 --> 01:51:25,294
mind ahead of time so that way he's in 
great shape and he can run a marathon 

2338
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:32,530
easily once.
Wait,

2339
01:51:32,890 --> 01:51:35,120
why won't you get withdrawals if you 
just quit like that?

2340
01:51:35,620 --> 01:51:37,870
Because I beT you can do it all the time
because I'm not me.

2341
01:51:37,890 --> 01:51:38,723
I thought for a moment you feel like you
feel uncomfortable for a day where 

2342
01:51:44,231 --> 01:51:45,390
you're like,
oh my god,

2343
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:50,530
hold on the last stretch,
stretch,

2344
01:51:51,580 --> 01:51:52,750
stretch.
How long ago?

2345
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:55,180
A car?
I don't know.

2346
01:51:55,340 --> 01:51:56,740
A couple weeks ago.
No,

2347
01:51:56,760 --> 01:52:00,580
really her house called unassisted 
sleeps.

2348
01:52:00,700 --> 01:52:02,560
That's when you go to sleep without 
drugs or alcohol?

2349
01:52:02,620 --> 01:52:03,580
No,
no weed.

2350
01:52:03,581 --> 01:52:04,750
No xanax,
no.

2351
01:52:05,700 --> 01:52:06,420
Yeah,
yeah,

2352
01:52:06,420 --> 01:52:09,410
yeah,
yeah,

2353
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:10,740
yeah.
Okay.

2354
01:52:10,740 --> 01:52:11,680
Okay.
Yeah.

2355
01:52:11,710 --> 01:52:14,220
We have a thing called unassisted sleeps
to.

2356
01:52:14,650 --> 01:52:16,600
I think that's a great idea.
I really do.

2357
01:52:16,690 --> 01:52:19,840
I think more people need to learn how to
relax,

2358
01:52:20,110 --> 01:52:21,400
meditate,
Just go to bed,

2359
01:52:21,550 --> 01:52:25,750
but you can also do your kids off.
You can get a hold of your own thoughts.

2360
01:52:26,020 --> 01:52:27,580
You can get ahold of your own thoughts 
and it's a good.

2361
01:52:27,670 --> 01:52:28,503
It's a good practice to do that and if 
you just give your own thoughts to 

2362
01:52:30,761 --> 01:52:32,950
pills,
I mean it'll work.

2363
01:52:33,490 --> 01:52:36,040
Maybe it won't work for everybody and it
works for some people,

2364
01:52:36,340 --> 01:52:39,250
but there's other ways to do it.
You could do it with your own mind.

2365
01:52:39,251 --> 01:52:40,520
You can.
You can relax yourself.

2366
01:52:40,521 --> 01:52:43,690
You cannot medItate.
You can do it without that.

2367
01:52:43,740 --> 01:52:46,190
I mean you can do it with,
but there's other

2368
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:47,023
pathways that a lot of people that try 
the pills don't try and I wonder how 

2369
01:52:50,181 --> 01:52:53,150
many would be successful.
I mean some people know,

2370
01:52:53,151 --> 01:52:53,984
some people have like real issues,
but with some people I think they'd 

2371
01:52:55,911 --> 01:52:59,780
probably be just as if not more 
successful with meditating,

2372
01:52:59,781 --> 01:53:02,150
relaxing,
just trying and figure out a way to like

2373
01:53:02,151 --> 01:53:06,230
consciously dip yourself down into the 
place where you go to sleep.

2374
01:53:06,470 --> 01:53:07,490
I'd like tHat.
What are you doing?

2375
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:08,870
You're going to try that?
No,

2376
01:53:09,140 --> 01:53:13,400
I did five days and a foreign assistance
sleeps.

2377
01:53:13,430 --> 01:53:15,380
This is what I'm thinking.
I'm thinking 30 days.

2378
01:53:15,390 --> 01:53:19,970
You 15 days?
October 90 90 minute hot yoga classes.

2379
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:24,410
That's what I'm thinking.
No booze and then half the days.

2380
01:53:24,650 --> 01:53:26,810
So if you have one day on you have one 
day off you.

2381
01:53:26,811 --> 01:53:27,644
Oh,
and if you miss them then you have to 

2382
01:53:29,001 --> 01:53:29,834
make them up in a row.
But you have to do 15 days of hot yoga 

2383
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:36,050
in a 30 day time period with no booze.

2384
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:38,120
I can do that.
Why do you want to do the hot yoga?

2385
01:53:38,420 --> 01:53:41,120
Because I think that would be super 
beneficial for them.

2386
01:53:41,121 --> 01:53:45,680
I think you should do that ina mount and
it's fucking certainly difficult to do.

2387
01:53:46,670 --> 01:53:49,070
Going to fail on that and still detox.
No,

2388
01:53:49,071 --> 01:53:50,690
he said,
he said 30 days.

2389
01:53:50,870 --> 01:53:54,200
Thirty days.
Just cut.

2390
01:53:54,470 --> 01:53:55,303
Half the days.
Half of those 30 you have to do a yoga 

2391
01:53:58,071 --> 01:53:59,690
class.
Hot yoga,

2392
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:00,950
hot yoga,
90 minutes.

2393
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:03,153
Once I've been.
I went once and I quit like 40 minutes 

2394
01:54:06,750 --> 01:54:08,480
into an hour and 15 minute class.
I came back in.

2395
01:54:08,481 --> 01:54:11,870
I took five minute breather.
I took it because it was hot.

2396
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:14,270
It was like fuck out of it.
I'm out of it.

2397
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:16,940
But you also like a couldn't run a 
marathon.

2398
01:54:16,941 --> 01:54:21,941
I could.
Oh no,

2399
01:54:24,700 --> 01:54:26,210
we all know.
No one would do that.

2400
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:28,340
So do it.
So wait.

2401
01:54:28,510 --> 01:54:29,343
Yeah,
there's no way you could do 1590 minute 

2402
01:54:31,131 --> 01:54:32,270
yoga classes in a month.

2403
01:54:32,450 --> 01:54:33,950
What?
Is that what you're saying?

2404
01:54:34,130 --> 01:54:35,060
In fact,
I've never,

2405
01:54:35,250 --> 01:54:36,083
I don't do them on time marathon know 
what I'm saying is I like the turkish 

2406
01:54:38,770 --> 01:54:39,603
state.
The thing about the yoga classes is 

2407
01:54:41,361 --> 01:54:42,194
first of all you could.
There's like a real set beginning and a 

2408
01:54:46,161 --> 01:54:48,410
set end.
There's no fudging was class.

2409
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:49,393
Yeah.
You have to be there to get it in and 

2410
01:54:51,081 --> 01:54:54,520
it's super difficult to do and I think 
it's one of the most beneficial mentally

2411
01:54:55,160 --> 01:54:57,320
mental breather.
Not good.

2412
01:54:57,380 --> 01:54:59,540
They tell you,
they instructor say,

2413
01:54:59,780 --> 01:55:02,840
yeah,
that's what the same people.

2414
01:55:02,990 --> 01:55:04,030
To see those,
those,

2415
01:55:04,250 --> 01:55:06,380
those little packets,
they leave in the shoes say,

2416
01:55:06,570 --> 01:55:11,570
do not eat.
Those fucking retards should meet me.

2417
01:55:12,350 --> 01:55:13,880
Should know that you're not going to eat
some shit.

2418
01:55:13,881 --> 01:55:17,270
You found your shoe Just so you should 
know that if you're going to die,

2419
01:55:17,390 --> 01:55:19,010
you should get out of the fucking yoga 
class,

2420
01:55:19,011 --> 01:55:19,510
so I'm sending.

2421
01:55:19,510 --> 01:55:22,820
You should be able to get out of there.
IT's for morons and pussies.

2422
01:55:22,821 --> 01:55:26,350
I'm sorry.
Can you look up hot yoga deaths,

2423
01:55:26,970 --> 01:55:29,700
the other rape sweating.
When they die,

2424
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:31,460
they die.
Thing dude,

2425
01:55:31,461 --> 01:55:33,560
you bring a cooler.
Bring one of those flasks.

2426
01:55:33,561 --> 01:55:38,561
They have these like giant can drinking 
64 postures like you do two sets,

2427
01:55:39,470 --> 01:55:42,000
attitude sets.
You're allowed to have some more break.

2428
01:55:43,250 --> 01:55:45,450
Take a five minute breather over that 
month will be three,

2429
01:55:45,451 --> 01:55:46,284
five minute brief,
but no,

2430
01:55:46,330 --> 01:55:47,163
I definitely had a panic attack.
You can take a breather and staying in 

2431
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:50,580
the room.
You're supposed to breathe,

2432
01:55:50,581 --> 01:55:51,414
they tell you to breathe.
Can you can breed in the room who Stay 

2433
01:55:53,650 --> 01:55:55,620
in the room.
It's a mental thing.

2434
01:55:55,650 --> 01:55:58,530
You can get by a five minute break.
Go.

2435
01:55:59,250 --> 01:56:00,180
Nope.
stay in the room.

2436
01:56:00,330 --> 01:56:03,050
You want to take a break?
Okay.

2437
01:56:03,180 --> 01:56:04,013
But no,
you don't have to have stayed before 

2438
01:56:06,451 --> 01:56:06,840
too.

2439
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:08,640
Yeah,
I stay all the time.

2440
01:56:08,770 --> 01:56:09,603
And you're not allowed to leave the 
place that I go where you all are doing 

2441
01:56:12,451 --> 01:56:17,451
it.
But this is yogurt and ice cream.

2442
01:56:20,671 --> 01:56:24,300
Cones melting in New York.
I could do them.

2443
01:56:24,690 --> 01:56:28,050
This is a super measurable thing.
okay.

2444
01:56:28,830 --> 01:56:29,663
So it's not like something you could not
train for and then have to do at the 

2445
01:56:33,631 --> 01:56:37,320
very end.
This is going to go run a marathon.

2446
01:56:37,321 --> 01:56:39,720
I kinda like fucking half acid up to the
time you got to run it.

2447
01:56:41,350 --> 01:56:45,220
This is like a sheer discipline issue 
because this is what the.

2448
01:56:45,330 --> 01:56:46,163
What's good about this is this going to 
cause you to absolutely be in a certain 

2449
01:56:49,381 --> 01:56:51,390
place for 15 days,
7:30.

2450
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:54,030
You have to make those up.
Like if you like,

2451
01:56:54,110 --> 01:56:54,943
say you fuck off for the first 10 days,
that means you got to do a lot of days 

2452
01:56:56,881 --> 01:56:57,714
in a row.
Would it be safe to do hot yoga four or 

2453
01:56:59,041 --> 01:57:00,150
five days in a row?
A hunDred percent.

2454
01:57:00,151 --> 01:57:02,880
You are.
That's how I plan on doing it again,

2455
01:57:02,881 --> 01:57:04,790
bro.
Please just go to the goddamn bathroom.

2456
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:10,520
No nothing.
So we're going to.

2457
01:57:17,090 --> 01:57:19,080
We're going to talk about nonsense,
but bullshIt.

2458
01:57:19,110 --> 01:57:21,030
Go to the bathroom,
go to the bathroom please.

2459
01:57:21,120 --> 01:57:22,710
And bring that goddamn kombucha with 
you.

2460
01:57:22,711 --> 01:57:23,544
That juggle,
like pulling it off his desk with your 

2461
01:57:26,191 --> 01:57:27,024
fucking attitude.

2462
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,600
Are you looking to kind of rip right 
now?

2463
01:57:30,730 --> 01:57:34,170
Ever since he got back?
Look bad at all.

2464
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:37,350
That's very legit.
Looking good.

2465
01:57:37,351 --> 01:57:42,351
Like a good athlete.
Great shape in the christchurch texts.

2466
01:57:46,220 --> 01:57:48,750
my jeans right now.
That looks like,

2467
01:57:48,751 --> 01:57:49,860
are you?
Fuck this.

2468
01:57:50,070 --> 01:57:52,820
Like you always got a legit six pack.
He does.

2469
01:57:52,821 --> 01:57:53,910
He does.
He does.

2470
01:57:54,360 --> 01:57:58,560
When he came back from yoga or yoga asia
st.

2471
01:58:00,510 --> 01:58:01,343
Never understand.
I never wanted to do this challenge you 

2472
01:58:06,941 --> 01:58:10,230
can listen to.
I like this idea of 15 days of hot yoga.

2473
01:58:10,620 --> 01:58:11,453
It's hard to do man,
90 minute classes and then and he's 

2474
01:58:14,311 --> 01:58:16,170
going to do a marathon.
You have to do a marathon.

2475
01:58:16,220 --> 01:58:17,940
Okay,
this will be a different thing.

2476
01:58:18,020 --> 01:58:20,100
It's a totally new about this as he 
thinks he coulD run all the time.

2477
01:58:20,101 --> 01:58:22,230
He runs all the time,
but if you have to do this,

2478
01:58:22,231 --> 01:58:23,250
this is going to be hard.

2479
01:58:23,370 --> 01:58:25,470
Running is easy for me because it's in 
my backyard.

2480
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:26,940
This is going to be super good for your 
body.

2481
01:58:27,260 --> 01:58:28,093
And then here's the other thing too,
like if you get in the middle of this 

2482
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:31,560
and you feel like you can't do it 
anymore,

2483
01:58:31,561 --> 01:58:33,840
you could relax.
You could just sit down,

2484
01:58:33,870 --> 01:58:34,703
lie down,
and just catching your class and your 

2485
01:58:36,211 --> 01:58:37,290
class.
People do it all the time,

2486
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:39,000
like advanced.
People do it all the time.

2487
01:58:39,001 --> 01:58:40,500
If you feel like you've overwhelmed 
yourself,

2488
01:58:40,650 --> 01:58:43,020
maybe try too hard,
you know it's fucking hot in there.

2489
01:58:43,060 --> 01:58:47,800
So 140 degrees and you do like these 
really difficult bodyweight exercises.

2490
01:58:47,801 --> 01:58:48,634
When you stand on one leg,
he got one leg kick back and you got 

2491
01:58:51,041 --> 01:58:53,860
your both arms leaning forward.
It's fucking difficult to do.

2492
01:58:53,890 --> 01:58:54,641
Sure,
you know,

2493
01:58:54,641 --> 01:58:56,800
and when you're holding yourself and 
like weird positions.

2494
01:58:57,020 --> 01:58:57,530
Oh,
that's good.

2495
01:58:57,530 --> 01:59:01,600
That's a really challenge.
It's a pretty easy,

2496
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:04,690
not easy.
A pretty not hard pace I should say,

2497
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:06,010
to do a five hour marathon.

2498
01:59:06,310 --> 01:59:11,310
So it's 11 minutes and 23 seconds per 
mile walking at like a four point five.

2499
01:59:12,100 --> 01:59:14,320
Isn't that interesting?
That's fIve minutes,

2500
01:59:14,440 --> 01:59:19,180
but 11 minutes and 30 seconds per mile.
You get it in six hours or five.

2501
01:59:19,181 --> 01:59:20,970
It's 50 k oh,
50 percent.

2502
01:59:21,110 --> 01:59:21,943
Oh that's right.
I mean I know that we're all making fun 

2503
01:59:23,631 --> 01:59:24,460
of this,
but oh,

2504
01:59:24,460 --> 01:59:25,293
a five hour marathon is,
is literally walking into four or five 

2505
01:59:28,011 --> 01:59:29,150
on a treadmill.
No,

2506
01:59:29,151 --> 01:59:32,750
but continuously anyone can do a lot of 
it is,

2507
01:59:32,820 --> 01:59:36,230
is it 11 miles an hour?
I'm walking on a treadmill walking.

2508
01:59:36,250 --> 01:59:37,970
It's not running.
It's not running,

2509
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:41,080
but it's not 1130 minutes.
Pramada casual.

2510
01:59:42,650 --> 01:59:44,150
brisk walk.
But by the way,

2511
01:59:44,180 --> 01:59:45,230
I'll tell you,
I saw my father,

2512
01:59:46,010 --> 01:59:51,010
he'd walk the marine corp marathon and 
he did great for about 20 miles and then

2513
01:59:53,061 --> 01:59:54,440
it bottoms out.
I did,

2514
01:59:54,441 --> 01:59:55,640
I did.
Uh,

2515
01:59:55,700 --> 01:59:58,610
when you did the thousandth episode,
I love these kinds of things.

2516
01:59:58,611 --> 02:00:02,630
I love when I watched the Florida state 
game yesterday and got on the trip.

2517
02:00:02,730 --> 02:00:05,530
What you watched boxing matches or 
fights when you work out?

2518
02:00:05,610 --> 02:00:06,320
Yeah,
I like to,

2519
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:07,153
I like a big event thing,
like the ending of game of thrones and 

2520
02:00:10,191 --> 02:00:11,024
you guys were doing that three hour 
podcasts and I literally said I'm going 

2521
02:00:12,951 --> 02:00:14,090
to be running a marathon today.

2522
02:00:14,630 --> 02:00:15,860
I did,
I did not do it.

2523
02:00:16,460 --> 02:00:18,830
I did not do it When I was seven.
I did 12,

2524
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:21,170
12,
only half a marathon.

2525
02:00:21,230 --> 02:00:24,560
But I was walking in it because joe was 
so fucking funny.

2526
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:25,633
I would start laughing.
Like we said he's changing color for it 

2527
02:00:28,791 --> 02:00:31,130
actually would funniest human being 
that's ever lived.

2528
02:00:31,170 --> 02:00:32,003
Yes.
But I started laughing so hard that I 

2529
02:00:33,441 --> 02:00:34,670
was like,
I can't fucking run this.

2530
02:00:34,671 --> 02:00:35,504
I want to listen to it.
I want to be in the moment and just 

2531
02:00:36,621 --> 02:00:38,480
giggle.
Good excuse to stop running.

2532
02:00:39,220 --> 02:00:40,190
And so,
uh,

2533
02:00:40,700 --> 02:00:41,533
and so I ended up doing 12 miles.
And in the three hours you ever do do 

2534
02:00:45,351 --> 02:00:46,184
the marathon.
I hope there's a hype crew behind your 

2535
02:00:47,361 --> 02:00:52,361
goat just quit.
Just metro stops.

2536
02:00:55,970 --> 02:00:56,803
Like what would be a challenging time?
You think you could still do it in a 

2537
02:00:58,701 --> 02:00:59,534
marathon?
Yeah.

2538
02:00:59,550 --> 02:01:02,910
I'm asking you a 10 minute miles.
Tommy tommy,

2539
02:01:03,540 --> 02:01:06,590
planning.
He's been plotting something miles,

2540
02:01:06,591 --> 02:01:08,240
which is how long?
Ten minute.

2541
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:12,170
Ten minute mile.
Ten minute mile.

2542
02:01:12,510 --> 02:01:13,343
That would be really fucking challenge.
I will say that the one that we just 

2543
02:01:16,971 --> 02:01:21,971
pulled up is still very challenging.
What's forced one to 10 minute mile pace

2544
02:01:22,820 --> 02:01:25,020
for $20.
You're just.

2545
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:26,460
You're no way.

2546
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:31,230
One hundred percent agree.
Hundred percent.

2547
02:01:31,250 --> 02:01:34,220
Great shape.
There's not a chance.

2548
02:01:34,440 --> 02:01:38,720
There's a chance you won't finish the 
marathon unless you take about 14 hours.

2549
02:01:38,721 --> 02:01:41,540
I'm not taking long,
long breaks for meals.

2550
02:01:42,010 --> 02:01:42,843
I think you do it in under 14 hours,
but maybe overall there should be like 

2551
02:01:47,060 --> 02:01:47,900
third high,
13,

2552
02:01:48,630 --> 02:01:53,060
13,
casually resting.

2553
02:01:53,270 --> 02:01:55,490
Seeing a movie in there.
I alsO want to know this really.

2554
02:01:55,730 --> 02:01:58,180
You think you could do this time with no
preparation,

2555
02:01:58,190 --> 02:01:59,450
no training.
Just do it tomorrow.

2556
02:02:00,230 --> 02:02:02,210
The 10 minute miles.
We're not tomorrow,

2557
02:02:02,240 --> 02:02:05,330
but next week.
How much distance do you think you could

2558
02:02:05,331 --> 02:02:10,331
run tomorrow?
The 18th to buck tomorrow?

2559
02:02:11,450 --> 02:02:12,283
Tomorrow.
How would you say since you think you 

2560
02:02:14,550 --> 02:02:16,480
could run,
how much could you say,

2561
02:02:17,060 --> 02:02:18,260
god,
this is the worst.

2562
02:02:18,290 --> 02:02:19,123
This is the reason I.
This is the reason I'll never quit 

2563
02:02:20,871 --> 02:02:23,060
drinking because I love this feeling 
tomorrow.

2564
02:02:23,120 --> 02:02:28,120
What nerves are crippling?
Anxiety.

2565
02:02:30,830 --> 02:02:32,210
I'll say this.
I'll say,

2566
02:02:32,930 --> 02:02:37,100
I'll say it thing a thing.
I'll say number and you guys tell me if.

2567
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:38,120
What do you.
Harry potter?

2568
02:02:38,121 --> 02:02:39,080
No,
bartering.

2569
02:02:39,140 --> 02:02:40,670
Bartering,
easily,

2570
02:02:40,730 --> 02:02:45,370
easily run a five k easy run a five k 
over,

2571
02:02:46,240 --> 02:02:47,240
over.
Over on.

2572
02:02:47,430 --> 02:02:49,850
On that obviously.
Obviously.

2573
02:02:49,870 --> 02:02:51,350
Yeah,
I could run a 10 k.

2574
02:02:51,351 --> 02:02:55,370
No problem.
For sure.

2575
02:02:55,371 --> 02:02:57,290
The pre problems?
No,

2576
02:02:57,410 --> 02:03:01,010
no problem.
I could run hard and we're talking about

2577
02:03:01,011 --> 02:03:01,691
no walking,
right?

2578
02:03:01,691 --> 02:03:05,060
There's a straight up run.
Straight to system.

2579
02:03:05,090 --> 02:03:05,870
Okay.
Okay.

2580
02:03:05,870 --> 02:03:07,430
What's your system?
I like to.

2581
02:03:07,460 --> 02:03:08,660
I like quoting.
Well no,

2582
02:03:10,850 --> 02:03:15,140
I like to.
I like to run and then walk,

2583
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:17,480
so that's all I've been doing because 
it's fun for me.

2584
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:19,860
It helps me for awhile.
Walk for awhile or shut,

2585
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:20,833
get it done.
I don't know.

2586
02:03:20,940 --> 02:03:22,280
I don't like this.
I'm sweating again.

2587
02:03:22,290 --> 02:03:23,123
I don't fucking like you.
Do you think you can do 20 miles 

2588
02:03:26,151 --> 02:03:26,984
tomorrow?

2589
02:03:27,620 --> 02:03:32,620
Because that's six point two miles short
of new hype band.

2590
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:33,130
Yeah.
No,

2591
02:03:33,130 --> 02:03:36,690
we know what we're Going with this joe.
AbsolutelY not knowing,

2592
02:03:41,180 --> 02:03:46,180
so anticlimactic sunup to sundown.
Twenty miles away.

2593
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:50,690
Twelve hours,
12 hours.

2594
02:03:50,850 --> 02:03:51,683
You could one running period.
THat's a pace for a 13 and a half hour 

2595
02:03:54,381 --> 02:03:56,060
marathon.
Exactly what he was talking about.

2596
02:03:56,120 --> 02:03:56,953
Just the way ladies who finds a wife 
finds a way making it easier to 

2597
02:04:02,230 --> 02:04:04,070
tomorrow's.
I plan on being at your house,

2598
02:04:04,150 --> 02:04:07,490
so I like bitch.
Let's go back to joe's challenge.

2599
02:04:07,590 --> 02:04:08,720
I like health.
I like,

2600
02:04:08,800 --> 02:04:11,780
okay.
Word 30 1:31

2601
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:12,920
october.
All of october.

2602
02:04:12,921 --> 02:04:14,030
Excuse me.
All of october.

2603
02:04:14,120 --> 02:04:15,410
Midnight to midnight,
midnight.

2604
02:04:16,410 --> 02:04:18,800
Just putting it out.
What happens?

2605
02:04:18,801 --> 02:04:19,634
What happens?
No booze and less and less and let's do 

2606
02:04:21,801 --> 02:04:24,700
thIs.
Let's let's let's look like a.

2607
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:26,390
This might be cheesy,
but let's.

2608
02:04:26,660 --> 02:04:29,810
Let's make this communal so I can 
challenge.

2609
02:04:29,811 --> 02:04:31,970
I can challenge people.
Go naipaul godsy,

2610
02:04:32,140 --> 02:04:34,290
no booze,
no boots.

2611
02:04:34,340 --> 02:04:37,980
You let everyone and have them commit to
the ankle bracelet

2612
02:04:38,440 --> 02:04:41,270
on happening.
It's difficult to do that.

2613
02:04:42,140 --> 02:04:44,010
Challenge,
I don't know,

2614
02:04:44,070 --> 02:04:46,820
but I don't think if we're going to do a
stand hope one,

2615
02:04:46,830 --> 02:04:48,810
we should find out whether or not you're
going to die.

2616
02:04:49,140 --> 02:04:52,100
We should start with me.
I'm going wait a minute,

2617
02:04:52,110 --> 02:04:52,943
but are you doing.
Are you doing the full thing or just 

2618
02:04:55,460 --> 02:04:56,830
want to join and they can join,
you know,

2619
02:04:57,480 --> 02:04:58,890
the yoga and they keep bringing them 
out.

2620
02:04:58,970 --> 02:05:00,410
We sHould be careful though.
Yeah,

2621
02:05:00,420 --> 02:05:01,253
of course.
This is one thing that we have to be 

2622
02:05:02,191 --> 02:05:06,330
careful about bert dying the reality to 
the sheer reality.

2623
02:05:06,331 --> 02:05:10,380
Like what is the volume of alcohol that 
you consume on a daily basis?

2624
02:05:11,300 --> 02:05:13,300
Could quantify that.
So wait,

2625
02:05:13,470 --> 02:05:14,303
can I ask you a question?
Are you worried about the alcohol 

2626
02:05:15,241 --> 02:05:16,080
business going on?

2627
02:05:21,110 --> 02:05:22,590
I'm worried about that.
Hit the economist.

2628
02:05:23,850 --> 02:05:28,850
What you're saying.
You like to join again?

2629
02:05:30,270 --> 02:05:31,103
That's what I was thinking.
We're going to tommy's house in speedos 

2630
02:05:35,551 --> 02:05:36,384
after this.
Joe.

2631
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:38,153
I wouldn't imagine anything else.
Oh my quantity and I'll be very candid 

2632
02:05:44,521 --> 02:05:45,354
about this,
but.

2633
02:05:45,430 --> 02:05:47,550
But once again,
it's like a.

2634
02:05:48,670 --> 02:05:51,240
I don't talk when I hit this,
you'd made a fucking Joke last time,

2635
02:05:51,241 --> 02:05:52,074
but that ankle bracelet and I'm fucking 
finally got that feeling out of my 

2636
02:05:53,971 --> 02:05:55,740
throat.
Interesting.

2637
02:05:57,030 --> 02:06:02,030
So anyway,
I know how much you consume.

2638
02:06:09,420 --> 02:06:11,460
That's what you were today.
What's your average day like?

2639
02:06:11,490 --> 02:06:16,490
Let's be real about this shit.
pretend there's a flight or pretended to

2640
02:06:17,401 --> 02:06:19,370
fight the good fight days and not fight 
it.

2641
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:21,390
Let's just have a regular day.
Let's saY.

2642
02:06:21,660 --> 02:06:22,493
Let's pretend for some strange reason.
You're home for a month and you're not 

2643
02:06:24,991 --> 02:06:28,200
traveling at all because I'm not in a 
month for a month.

2644
02:06:28,200 --> 02:06:29,430
I'm not drinking,
not drinking.

2645
02:06:29,790 --> 02:06:31,320
If I'm home for a month,
I would not drink.

2646
02:06:31,380 --> 02:06:33,420
No drinking.
shows,

2647
02:06:34,730 --> 02:06:35,790
shows,
comedy store.

2648
02:06:37,290 --> 02:06:39,750
I went to the store and you were like,
hey,

2649
02:06:39,751 --> 02:06:42,360
let's have a drink.
I'll be the starter.

2650
02:06:42,790 --> 02:06:45,630
I was not drinking one night and we all 
did this show.

2651
02:06:45,631 --> 02:06:47,730
You would come up to me and so maybe I 
say,

2652
02:06:48,100 --> 02:06:49,730
maybe I drink,
drink.

2653
02:06:50,980 --> 02:06:53,100
Come on,
go about your drinking.

2654
02:06:53,110 --> 02:06:54,000
I'll take a picture.
I could show.

2655
02:06:54,010 --> 02:06:57,240
Okay for drinking.
Old boys were fucking drink.

2656
02:06:57,270 --> 02:06:58,103
Come on guys.
You're going to give me anxiety if I'm 

2657
02:07:03,091 --> 02:07:05,100
the only one drinking.
It sounds so familiar.

2658
02:07:06,060 --> 02:07:07,210
Okay,
good.

2659
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:08,353
I'm fuck.
I'm going to be really nice to see my 

2660
02:07:09,511 --> 02:07:10,770
kids.
What's the actual.

2661
02:07:10,771 --> 02:07:12,040
You'll be fine.
We'll be fine.

2662
02:07:12,540 --> 02:07:15,010
What's the actUal consumption?
Yeah.

2663
02:07:15,170 --> 02:07:18,120
Yeah.
Let's say the average day.

2664
02:07:18,210 --> 02:07:21,480
I wouldn't Start drinking until I woke 
up.

2665
02:07:22,110 --> 02:07:22,661
No,
no,

2666
02:07:22,661 --> 02:07:22,951
no,
no.

2667
02:07:22,951 --> 02:07:23,600
I don't.
I don't.

2668
02:07:23,600 --> 02:07:24,433
Let's hear it.

2669
02:07:26,460 --> 02:07:31,460
My average day right now is on the road 
and I and I will drink.

2670
02:07:32,610 --> 02:07:35,740
I'll have my first sip of a drink.
The second step on stage.

2671
02:07:35,741 --> 02:07:37,390
I'll take a sip.
I'm,

2672
02:07:37,660 --> 02:07:38,493
I do not drink that whole drink and 
there's a lot of people that have seen 

2673
02:07:40,781 --> 02:07:41,614
me live recently and they can probably 
all attest that they're bummed out that 

2674
02:07:44,171 --> 02:07:46,390
I don't murder the drink on the first 
show.

2675
02:07:46,480 --> 02:07:47,313
you've never drank fake drinks though.
Never drink for exchange and need to 

2676
02:07:49,241 --> 02:07:50,390
know that.
Uh,

2677
02:07:50,710 --> 02:07:51,543
I remember,
uh,

2678
02:07:51,820 --> 02:07:52,653
I'll tell I'll call them out.
So I called him about on my podcast who 

2679
02:07:54,460 --> 02:07:57,900
tell when I worked with him in my why 
Hawaii,

2680
02:07:58,150 --> 02:07:59,530
miami,
miami.

2681
02:07:59,540 --> 02:08:03,380
I'm really high,
really high.

2682
02:08:03,890 --> 02:08:06,790
Like I wasn't a england.

2683
02:08:07,120 --> 02:08:12,120
I was in Hawaii,
Hawaii.

2684
02:08:20,270 --> 02:08:25,120
Why might confuse those two?
What do you think?

2685
02:08:25,121 --> 02:08:26,080
You didn't have a stroke,

2686
02:08:28,050 --> 02:08:31,140
you might tell didn't do real shot.
And I was like,

2687
02:08:31,620 --> 02:08:35,260
because he was my hero and on his room 
and I was like,

2688
02:08:35,290 --> 02:08:36,930
hey.
I was like fuck.

2689
02:08:37,150 --> 02:08:39,400
But he doesn't drink.
He stopped drinking milk.

2690
02:08:39,420 --> 02:08:44,420
This is 2004.
I meT him.

2691
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,890
Stop.
He stopped five years ago.

2692
02:08:47,891 --> 02:08:49,700
Ish.
A.

2693
02:08:49,730 --> 02:08:51,850
Yeah,
no shame in marin.

2694
02:08:51,851 --> 02:08:53,550
Started his podcast.
Olin is,

2695
02:08:53,551 --> 02:08:55,770
I know that aaron had them on and he 
wasn't drinking.

2696
02:08:55,771 --> 02:08:59,320
I need you in skittles.
That's more than that.

2697
02:08:59,321 --> 02:09:01,720
Then that's like eight years.
So it's been awhile.

2698
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:03,210
Probably.
Maybe the telecos moving.

2699
02:09:03,211 --> 02:09:03,910
I go,
yeah,

2700
02:09:03,910 --> 02:09:05,530
but I think,
I think uh,

2701
02:09:06,680 --> 02:09:07,513
I don't know what I was talking about.
I heard marin is when she went in that 

2702
02:09:10,001 --> 02:09:14,950
new wrestling show on netflix to a bunch
of people that he kills it,

2703
02:09:16,020 --> 02:09:16,853
this female wrestling glow.
It's called crazy manager character and 

2704
02:09:22,271 --> 02:09:23,680
he was great.
He kills it.

2705
02:09:23,681 --> 02:09:24,311
Really?
It's like,

2706
02:09:24,311 --> 02:09:26,290
yeah,
it's like the perfect role for him,

2707
02:09:26,350 --> 02:09:27,950
dude.
Have you seen any sort?

2708
02:09:28,080 --> 02:09:30,340
Psyched?
I heard it was really good about that.

2709
02:09:30,341 --> 02:09:31,230
I'm terrified.
I'm on.

2710
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:33,760
I'm on episode three.
I'm freaking the fuck out.

2711
02:09:34,030 --> 02:09:35,830
Did you see the end of the game of 
thrones?

2712
02:09:35,940 --> 02:09:37,130
Yes.
Right there.

2713
02:09:37,330 --> 02:09:38,880
There's too much good shit on you.
So.

2714
02:09:38,890 --> 02:09:40,870
But I was a kid.
We had starsky and hutch.

2715
02:09:41,050 --> 02:09:41,883
Okay.
Well we had itv made us dumber and it 

2716
02:09:44,141 --> 02:09:47,560
was like eating cardboard.
That was horrible.

2717
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:50,380
The difference between like what people 
have today on tv.

2718
02:09:50,381 --> 02:09:54,460
It's insane.
Game of thrones and ozark.

2719
02:09:54,490 --> 02:09:57,580
just those two really good.
Haven't seen it.

2720
02:09:59,700 --> 02:10:02,800
You watched that first five minutes.
First 10 minutes of ozarks.

2721
02:10:02,950 --> 02:10:05,680
You're watching the whole scene.
Jason bateman in that.

2722
02:10:05,710 --> 02:10:10,710
He's domino.
The casting of his wife.

2723
02:10:11,080 --> 02:10:11,861
yes.
Brilliant.

2724
02:10:11,861 --> 02:10:13,000
Phenomenal.
Brilliant.

2725
02:10:13,480 --> 02:10:14,920
By the way,
her name again?

2726
02:10:14,921 --> 02:10:16,510
What is laura?
Laura linney.

2727
02:10:16,540 --> 02:10:18,180
She's amazing.
She's amazing.

2728
02:10:18,280 --> 02:10:22,390
Fucking show is so good.
You get so locked in like jesus,

2729
02:10:22,460 --> 02:10:24,550
like it's just,
it's just one of those shows were like,

2730
02:10:24,551 --> 02:10:27,580
whoa.
Best comedy on on streaming.

2731
02:10:27,610 --> 02:10:29,890
No questions asked.
Angie tribeca.

2732
02:10:30,130 --> 02:10:34,040
What's that?
It is.

2733
02:10:34,430 --> 02:10:39,430
It's true because she said her name 
wrong and drove back from tribe back.

2734
02:10:45,261 --> 02:10:50,261
Guy jones quincy or angie jo.
Rashida jones.

2735
02:10:51,240 --> 02:10:53,870
Jones asked jamie.
He's a proLific tones.

2736
02:10:54,050 --> 02:10:55,070
Deon cole,
black,

2737
02:10:55,071 --> 02:10:57,650
twitter that guy,
and then andre vermilion.

2738
02:10:58,070 --> 02:11:00,650
What is this?
So it is the naked gun,

2739
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:04,360
but in a csi miami type show,
but it's,

2740
02:11:04,450 --> 02:11:05,390
yeah,
it's a naked gun.

2741
02:11:05,391 --> 02:11:06,224
So it's,
it's,

2742
02:11:06,760 --> 02:11:10,550
it's like imagine if you saw a brand new
naked gun or a airplane.

2743
02:11:11,350 --> 02:11:12,183
So fucking funny.
And I watched it with my kids and we 

2744
02:11:15,861 --> 02:11:17,210
just.
And they'd never seen an airplane.

2745
02:11:17,211 --> 02:11:20,810
So it's that introduction of airplane or
naked gun to them.

2746
02:11:20,870 --> 02:11:22,820
So they go for big jokes like the whole 
time.

2747
02:11:22,980 --> 02:11:23,813
Yeah,
everything.

2748
02:11:23,870 --> 02:11:24,770
Just joke,
joke,

2749
02:11:24,771 --> 02:11:25,251
joke,
joke,

2750
02:11:25,251 --> 02:11:26,084
joke,
joke.

2751
02:11:26,690 --> 02:11:28,940
It's really a great show,
huh?

2752
02:11:29,570 --> 02:11:32,890
That's cool.
How do we get to that by burt?

2753
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:36,110
Prior probably said no.
I said have you seen ozarks?

2754
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:41,020
Oh yeah,
like gaMe of thrones ozark and there's a

2755
02:11:41,030 --> 02:11:43,750
neW season of narcos.
It's out to see that.

2756
02:11:43,850 --> 02:11:48,170
It's just more good television aliens 
right now.

2757
02:11:48,260 --> 02:11:51,620
Don't you feel like it's hard for a 
movie to even work now?

2758
02:11:51,800 --> 02:11:52,633
Like when you go to see movie,
most movies are done because they don't 

2759
02:11:54,380 --> 02:11:57,080
have to go for it.
But you've seen the same show.

2760
02:11:57,090 --> 02:11:58,700
Netflix,
the same shot at hbo.

2761
02:11:58,730 --> 02:11:59,750
The level of like,
wow,

2762
02:11:59,751 --> 02:12:00,584
this looks fucking gorgeous.
They have thiS opportunity to stretch 

2763
02:12:02,721 --> 02:12:03,770
out these storylines.

2764
02:12:06,860 --> 02:12:09,770
This season was a fucking seven hour 
movie.

2765
02:12:11,510 --> 02:12:14,320
Amazing movie.
I've never watched it.

2766
02:12:15,020 --> 02:12:20,020
I never watched tommy tommy.
I will.

2767
02:12:22,720 --> 02:12:24,550
Shit.
I watched the pilot.

2768
02:12:24,620 --> 02:12:27,620
I watched the pilot episode of game of 
thrones the other day just on a lark.

2769
02:12:27,621 --> 02:12:28,454
I was.
I was like,

2770
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:29,353
what's this?
Because I saw the finale and I was so 

2771
02:12:30,891 --> 02:12:33,560
into it.
You started with the finale?

2772
02:12:33,590 --> 02:12:34,400
No,
hold on,

2773
02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:35,360
hold on,
hold on one second.

2774
02:12:36,160 --> 02:12:36,950
No,
no one's listening to.

2775
02:12:36,950 --> 02:12:38,750
This is all the fat and I watched.
I watched.

2776
02:12:39,490 --> 02:12:41,870
Oh my god.
I watched the whole series.

2777
02:12:43,100 --> 02:12:44,450
Yeah,
with everyone else.

2778
02:12:44,810 --> 02:12:45,643
I watched the finale and I was so 
wrapped up in what was going on that I 

2779
02:12:48,141 --> 02:12:48,974
want on my own.
Matriyoga go and I click the pilot 

2780
02:12:50,421 --> 02:12:51,980
episode,
dude,

2781
02:12:52,280 --> 02:12:54,350
watch the pilot episode and you will say
to yourself,

2782
02:12:54,950 --> 02:12:56,750
oh shit,
I get it.

2783
02:12:56,930 --> 02:12:59,570
Like all these things that were a little
plots that how they got there,

2784
02:12:59,571 --> 02:13:00,260
dire wolf's.

2785
02:13:00,260 --> 02:13:01,430
I didn't know how they got the dire 
wolves.

2786
02:13:01,431 --> 02:13:03,230
I didn't know that.
They found.

2787
02:13:03,260 --> 02:13:04,093
They found a big elk that had murdered 
and they couldn't figure how it was 

2788
02:13:07,341 --> 02:13:08,174
murdered and then they went and they saw
that the elks horn had gone through a 

2789
02:13:11,481 --> 02:13:15,820
dire wolf and direwolves shouldn't be 
south of the wall in one fell.

2790
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:21,160
And so as John Snow picked up for dire 
wolf's and cubs and he said she just had

2791
02:13:22,131 --> 02:13:23,630
cubs,
You should all have your cubs.

2792
02:13:24,260 --> 02:13:26,990
They should go to ned stark's children 
and cause.

2793
02:13:27,100 --> 02:13:28,250
Cause he's not,
you know,

2794
02:13:28,251 --> 02:13:29,084
they shouLd go to the starks,
therefore starks keeps them all a dire 

2795
02:13:31,050 --> 02:13:32,260
wolf.
And then.

2796
02:13:32,370 --> 02:13:35,190
And then the guy got his dick cut off,
he goes,

2797
02:13:35,191 --> 02:13:36,480
uh,
he shouldn't get one.

2798
02:13:36,481 --> 02:13:37,470
YOu're a bastard.

2799
02:13:38,450 --> 02:13:39,283
You're watching it or yeah.
This is like the machine you're 

2800
02:13:40,421 --> 02:13:43,580
watchinG.
You're watching him do this long enough.

2801
02:13:43,660 --> 02:13:45,340
And then aS they leave they see a.

2802
02:13:45,610 --> 02:13:48,790
I see a fucking run one.
Yeah.

2803
02:13:48,840 --> 02:13:49,820
Right.
And they go,

2804
02:13:49,821 --> 02:13:50,740
you should have this one.
You're,

2805
02:13:50,890 --> 02:13:52,310
you're the bastard.
You should have this one.

2806
02:13:52,750 --> 02:13:54,560
Dude.
That was a book on tape.

2807
02:13:55,150 --> 02:13:57,430
That was pretty cool actually.
That was pretty good.

2808
02:13:57,550 --> 02:14:00,430
It was fucking murdering me.
That was pretty good.

2809
02:14:00,460 --> 02:14:05,460
My medicine at your house,
man,

2810
02:14:07,180 --> 02:14:12,180
I was right there with the last few 
minutes.

2811
02:14:12,671 --> 02:14:17,671
You've been alive and talking to her.
She would never feature for me.

2812
02:14:29,310 --> 02:14:34,310
A lesson bombed so hard that if there is
a tape of this bombing,

2813
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:38,913
it was so bad.
It's so hard that you broke it down on 

2814
02:14:42,791 --> 02:14:44,170
your podcast.
What was that one?

2815
02:14:44,200 --> 02:14:46,030
That was winnipeg by the way.
This one's worse.

2816
02:14:46,270 --> 02:14:47,860
This one actually is worse.
Yeah,

2817
02:14:48,500 --> 02:14:50,380
because no one spoke.
Yeah,

2818
02:14:50,381 --> 02:14:51,214
it's true.
So it's just listening to someone 

2819
02:14:52,421 --> 02:14:55,010
monologue in a room of people where 
everyone's like,

2820
02:14:55,340 --> 02:14:56,770
oh,
tommy,

2821
02:14:56,771 --> 02:14:58,780
back at the time you stopped his hair a 
little longer.

2822
02:14:58,790 --> 02:15:00,310
Need feather it back.
Right.

2823
02:15:00,940 --> 02:15:02,850
And so.
But he was still balding,

2824
02:15:02,870 --> 02:15:04,540
You know,
it's the hiding a body.

2825
02:15:04,541 --> 02:15:06,340
Men.
I bring them into the club,

2826
02:15:06,460 --> 02:15:09,190
I drive up with them,
I drive up with them to sacramento.

2827
02:15:09,191 --> 02:15:10,420
I say,
I vouched for him.

2828
02:15:10,421 --> 02:15:11,860
This guy's fucking lyrics.
You're gonna.

2829
02:15:11,861 --> 02:15:13,690
Love him.
The manager.

2830
02:15:13,691 --> 02:15:16,840
Leslie is like a.
We had a feature book.

2831
02:15:16,870 --> 02:15:18,460
I go,
this guy is 10 times funnier.

2832
02:15:18,461 --> 02:15:19,480
Trust me.
She was.

2833
02:15:19,481 --> 02:15:23,080
He better be.
He goes out in his first joke,

2834
02:15:23,200 --> 02:15:24,033
flies out to nobody and everyone,
and this girl leslie walked right up to 

2835
02:15:27,281 --> 02:15:28,890
me and she goes,
he's,

2836
02:15:29,260 --> 02:15:33,090
you said he was going to be funny and I 
see sweat forming on his brow,

2837
02:15:33,460 --> 02:15:34,293
bubbling up and then I see his hair 
collapsed to the side and start getting 

2838
02:15:37,181 --> 02:15:38,014
wet.

2839
02:15:38,320 --> 02:15:40,470
Tom tom,
look skeptIcal.

2840
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:41,460
It was terrible.
No,

2841
02:15:41,461 --> 02:15:41,780
no,
he,

2842
02:15:41,780 --> 02:15:43,350
he.
It was worse than he was.

2843
02:15:44,290 --> 02:15:45,130
It's worse.
It was.

2844
02:15:45,180 --> 02:15:48,360
I remember it's 2005.
I opened on a rape joke.

2845
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:51,153
It was about hurricane katrina,
hurricane katrina rape joke because it 

2846
02:15:54,791 --> 02:15:56,130
was,
it was,

2847
02:15:57,050 --> 02:15:57,883
it was right after katrina.
They said that people were getting 

2848
02:16:02,460 --> 02:16:04,560
raped,
the metrodome.

2849
02:16:04,860 --> 02:16:06,060
So I did this thing,
but I was like,

2850
02:16:06,750 --> 02:16:08,340
what is it?
The super dope,

2851
02:16:08,920 --> 02:16:12,630
the metronomes would sits on a piano.
I made like some type of joke,

2852
02:16:12,631 --> 02:16:14,040
like,
like he like,

2853
02:16:14,041 --> 02:16:15,570
hey,
they say there's something.

2854
02:16:15,571 --> 02:16:16,404
Like they say,
people are getting raped in the 

2855
02:16:19,831 --> 02:16:22,220
aftermath,
like nothing would turn me on,

2856
02:16:22,221 --> 02:16:24,700
like seeing a dead body float by like 
some,

2857
02:16:24,720 --> 02:16:27,810
some or things like that where I'm like 
making fun of it.

2858
02:16:28,170 --> 02:16:29,003
But like it wasn't a written joke,
it was just something that I said and 

2859
02:16:32,951 --> 02:16:36,400
then I insisted on doing it a second 
time and that's when the,

2860
02:16:36,401 --> 02:16:38,250
that's when the hair falls to the side 
and capital.

2861
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:39,970
I sweated it off.
Like I bombed on the,

2862
02:16:40,160 --> 02:16:40,993
I opened with it and I bombed for 25 
straight minutes actually 22 because 

2863
02:16:44,231 --> 02:16:46,240
when I got off she goes,
why didn't you do 25?

2864
02:16:46,270 --> 02:16:50,200
And I was like,
because I was dying and I thought,

2865
02:16:50,201 --> 02:16:51,760
and she was like,
I pay you for 25.

2866
02:16:51,970 --> 02:16:54,070
Oh mY.
And then I opened the second show on the

2867
02:16:54,071 --> 02:16:59,071
same joke and I ate equal shit for 25 
minutes to it again,

2868
02:16:59,500 --> 02:17:03,580
I should say it was sold out.
So it was wall to wall packed,

2869
02:17:03,910 --> 02:17:07,390
peppered 300,
300 people.

2870
02:17:07,391 --> 02:17:09,820
And I was just like soaking wet.
And I remember the uh,

2871
02:17:09,821 --> 02:17:10,990
what was the mc?
Tommy.

2872
02:17:11,800 --> 02:17:13,090
Oh yeah,
tom.

2873
02:17:13,150 --> 02:17:15,530
Oh fuck,
goddammit.

2874
02:17:15,780 --> 02:17:16,613
Oh,
tom mcclain,

2875
02:17:16,760 --> 02:17:17,593
tom,
and you know you're eating shit when 

2876
02:17:19,181 --> 02:17:22,210
you're the feature act and you walk in 
the green room when the mc is like,

2877
02:17:22,240 --> 02:17:23,330
oh man,
you fuck.

2878
02:17:24,250 --> 02:17:25,620
Like,
oh.

2879
02:17:25,980 --> 02:17:26,813
He was like,
I've never seen anyone eat shit like 

2880
02:17:28,751 --> 02:17:30,220
this in my life.
So crazy.

2881
02:17:31,240 --> 02:17:32,710
by the way,
this is a testament.

2882
02:17:33,070 --> 02:17:36,840
This is a testament to tom,
is that you like mutually.

2883
02:17:36,850 --> 02:17:38,890
If you brought a common companies bomb 
that hard,

2884
02:17:38,891 --> 02:17:40,600
you'd be like,
I'll never talked to this guy again.

2885
02:17:40,601 --> 02:17:42,370
Like maybe you shouldn't be doing 
comedy.

2886
02:17:42,970 --> 02:17:43,803
TOm talking to me in the green room 
about his bombing or at the bar after 

2887
02:17:46,660 --> 02:17:47,493
was me.
I remember we drove home on that ride 

2888
02:17:50,410 --> 02:17:51,340
and I was like,
oh,

2889
02:17:51,341 --> 02:17:52,780
this is my new best friend.
Yeah,

2890
02:17:52,781 --> 02:17:54,010
that was great.
I do.

2891
02:17:54,070 --> 02:17:56,770
I also remember that when we got back to
la,

2892
02:17:57,130 --> 02:17:57,963
you go,
you didn't talk much and I know that's 

2893
02:18:00,251 --> 02:18:01,084
because you were talking.
Do you remember the time you were like 

2894
02:18:02,470 --> 02:18:05,560
you were talking about two different 
memories of an event?

2895
02:18:07,240 --> 02:18:09,870
Actually,
he said,

2896
02:18:09,880 --> 02:18:10,713
I think I told you this before,
but you say he saved my ass because I 

2897
02:18:12,341 --> 02:18:14,410
bombed so hard and think about.

2898
02:18:15,130 --> 02:18:15,963
Think about a straight uP 25 minute bomb
and then on the late show doing it 

2899
02:18:18,970 --> 02:18:21,160
exactly the same again.
I know you guys are wrong.

2900
02:18:21,230 --> 02:18:22,310
I'll show you.
Yeah,

2901
02:18:22,490 --> 02:18:23,323
you do it.
I think I was convinced that I could 

2902
02:18:25,811 --> 02:18:29,740
make that,
that stupid thing like I was like,

2903
02:18:29,741 --> 02:18:30,910
I want to.
I want to get it right,

2904
02:18:30,940 --> 02:18:32,230
so I'm going to do it.
I'll show them.

2905
02:18:32,231 --> 02:18:33,064
I can do that.
Right?

2906
02:18:33,090 --> 02:18:33,923
Rather than public is thinking.
This similar thing is hurricane harvey 

2907
02:18:36,070 --> 02:18:36,903
right now.
People are coming together and you're 

2908
02:18:37,751 --> 02:18:41,440
making a fucking rape or dead body.
I wasn't encouraging.

2909
02:18:41,441 --> 02:18:44,530
And what did you adjust?
What did you adjust on the late show?

2910
02:18:47,660 --> 02:18:52,660
I just thought that get it,
sit down with it and go.

2911
02:18:53,681 --> 02:18:55,530
Let me try to pick this.
I was like,

2912
02:18:55,570 --> 02:18:56,403
they were 2005.
How many years have you been doing 

2913
02:19:00,761 --> 02:19:02,020
comedy?
It was my third year.

2914
02:19:02,320 --> 02:19:04,540
Oh wow.
He's my damn.

2915
02:19:04,541 --> 02:19:05,770
that's a slippery time,
right?

2916
02:19:05,960 --> 02:19:07,470
Well,
and then in the hotel or I'm not going.

2917
02:19:07,490 --> 02:19:08,141
I was like,
man,

2918
02:19:08,141 --> 02:19:08,974
this fucking is this where it's going to
be like I really fucked up over those 

2919
02:19:12,221 --> 02:19:15,700
two bombings of how I met and then I got
back in time.

2920
02:19:15,730 --> 02:19:16,990
I mean it was,
it was pretty rough.

2921
02:19:16,991 --> 02:19:17,824
I got the next day was saturday,
so that was friday night to ethic 

2922
02:19:20,711 --> 02:19:21,544
bombings and then saturday for show's 
about to start and I could see these 

2923
02:19:25,151 --> 02:19:26,470
guys are like eyeballing me.
Like,

2924
02:19:26,830 --> 02:19:27,870
yo man,
this is like,

2925
02:19:27,950 --> 02:19:29,430
like I'm a make a wish kid or something 
like,

2926
02:19:29,431 --> 02:19:32,200
you gotta like me,
not me.

2927
02:19:32,290 --> 02:19:33,410
Well no,
but then you came up to me,

2928
02:19:33,411 --> 02:19:34,730
you go,
can I give you one piece of advice?

2929
02:19:35,890 --> 02:19:38,990
You drank and then you were letting you 
go,

2930
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:42,130
uh,
you go just open with a different chart,

2931
02:19:42,770 --> 02:19:43,603
just do everything else that you wanted 
to do the same open with a different 

2932
02:19:46,401 --> 02:19:47,300
joke.
And I go,

2933
02:19:47,350 --> 02:19:48,021
okay,
okay,

2934
02:19:48,021 --> 02:19:49,430
okay.
And then it went,

2935
02:19:49,730 --> 02:19:53,540
it went amazing.
Here's how shitty it was.

2936
02:19:53,541 --> 02:19:56,360
Like that manager loves the night before
it was like,

2937
02:19:56,660 --> 02:19:59,180
this is like,
you really a dog shit up.

2938
02:19:59,181 --> 02:20:00,330
They're white.
It's like,

2939
02:20:00,340 --> 02:20:01,670
I don't think,
I mean that's terrible.

2940
02:20:02,140 --> 02:20:03,460
She was me.
I was like,

2941
02:20:03,590 --> 02:20:04,423
ah.
So saturday it was also full and it 

2942
02:20:08,301 --> 02:20:11,000
fucking,
it was like an epic show.

2943
02:20:11,030 --> 02:20:13,880
It was like exactly what yOu'd want 
after a bombing like that.

2944
02:20:14,150 --> 02:20:18,230
And they had a curtain like this 
separating the showroom from the bar,

2945
02:20:18,260 --> 02:20:20,000
like not even a wall,
just a curtain.

2946
02:20:20,450 --> 02:20:22,190
So after,
after my set,

2947
02:20:22,191 --> 02:20:25,100
he's on stage,
I just opened the curtain and I go,

2948
02:20:25,130 --> 02:20:26,660
well,
like nice recovery,

2949
02:20:26,661 --> 02:20:27,051
right?
She goes,

2950
02:20:27,051 --> 02:20:28,070
what happened?
I was back here.

2951
02:20:28,120 --> 02:20:33,120
Oh you heard that shit.
Horse

2952
02:20:33,850 --> 02:20:36,160

time I've featured there,

2953
02:20:36,610 --> 02:20:39,520
she criticized me and then I uh,
I,

2954
02:20:39,580 --> 02:20:41,500
I did a good feature set and she was 
like,

2955
02:20:41,501 --> 02:20:42,251
I was like,
what dId you think?

2956
02:20:42,251 --> 02:20:43,240
She was like,
didn't hear it.

2957
02:20:43,241 --> 02:20:44,560
And I was like,
oh fuck you,

2958
02:20:44,620 --> 02:20:46,900
you boys sound salty.
Yeah.

2959
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:52,040
Well sophos is tough club to do.
That was a bounced check me to shout out

2960
02:20:53,471 --> 02:20:56,560
to steve groves.
I'll say his name.

2961
02:20:57,610 --> 02:20:58,443
I bombed once in South Carolina,
one on golfing trip with my college 

2962
02:21:00,430 --> 02:21:02,200
friends,
high school friends.

2963
02:21:02,201 --> 02:21:04,600
Hughes me,
we went out there and I did a guest spot

2964
02:21:04,601 --> 02:21:08,680
at the coconut,
something in charleston and then we were

2965
02:21:08,681 --> 02:21:10,810
driving like a day later and some girls 
were like,

2966
02:21:10,830 --> 02:21:11,980
you know,
because the vacation town,

2967
02:21:11,981 --> 02:21:12,581
they were like,
ooh,

2968
02:21:12,581 --> 02:21:14,450
like screaming at us in some ways,
like what are they saying?

2969
02:21:14,451 --> 02:21:15,281
And someone's like,
oh,

2970
02:21:15,281 --> 02:21:16,114
there's that guy who bombed last night 
because I didn't mention it when I got 

2971
02:21:19,691 --> 02:21:20,800
off stage it was like,
let's go.

2972
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:21,673
Oh,
you want you wanna hear good bombing 

2973
02:21:22,691 --> 02:21:23,600
story.
Yeah.

2974
02:21:24,340 --> 02:21:25,173
The comedy corner in atlanta,
I just don't stand up one time and I 

2975
02:21:29,261 --> 02:21:30,850
signed up for the comedy quarter 
atlantic's,

2976
02:21:30,851 --> 02:21:34,030
my girlfriend lived there.
So when mike night open mic night,

2977
02:21:34,330 --> 02:21:36,880

I show up to an all black club,

2978
02:21:37,840 --> 02:21:40,530
but I'm unaware of the way open mic 
night worse.

2979
02:21:40,570 --> 02:21:45,570
So I buy tickets for me and her and they
set us up front to watch white people.

2980
02:21:46,181 --> 02:21:47,470
The oNly two white people in the whole 
room.

2981
02:21:48,310 --> 02:21:52,510
First guy comes on stage and starts 
making fun of me and says,

2982
02:21:52,511 --> 02:21:53,310
uh,
uh,

2983
02:21:53,310 --> 02:21:53,981
what's your name?
I said,

2984
02:21:53,981 --> 02:21:55,360
it's burt.
And they go nuts.

2985
02:21:55,530 --> 02:21:57,940
I'll we're going to call you birdie.
Burt will give you a hood name is birdie

2986
02:21:58,050 --> 02:21:58,811

I was like,

2987
02:21:58,811 --> 02:21:59,141

2988
02:21:59,141 --> 02:22:01,450
yeah.
It's great and they make fun of me.

2989
02:22:01,510 --> 02:22:06,160
Every black comic comes oN,
make fun of me for fucking ever.

2990
02:22:07,330 --> 02:22:08,740
Then he gets the end of the show and was
like,

2991
02:22:08,741 --> 02:22:10,420
we got one more comment to come up last 
time.

2992
02:22:10,421 --> 02:22:11,680
A good evening.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2993
02:22:11,980 --> 02:22:13,900
put your hands together for burger.
Crikey,

2994
02:22:14,350 --> 02:22:15,920
great teacher.
Honestly,

2995
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:17,420
and then he goes,
oh wait,

2996
02:22:18,010 --> 02:22:18,843
oh shit.
It's birdie part and the place goes 

2997
02:22:20,501 --> 02:22:21,334
fucking nuts.
This is the guy that had been fucking 

2998
02:22:22,931 --> 02:22:25,150
with the whole night and I get up on 
stage.

2999
02:22:25,230 --> 02:22:26,063
I go,
you guys ever jack off and a 

3000
02:22:27,061 --> 02:22:32,061
cheeseburger and the guy they liked and 
we're rooting for started sucking.

3001
02:22:33,970 --> 02:22:38,820
They fucking lit me up on stage like 
I've never to this day been lit up and I

3002
02:22:38,821 --> 02:22:39,980
had no comeback.
Side note.

3003
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:42,570
I was like,
ah dude.

3004
02:22:42,840 --> 02:22:46,770
They fucking went from love to hate in 
an incident with one joke.

3005
02:22:46,771 --> 02:22:50,820
How uncomfortable was it after the show?
Oh yeah,

3006
02:22:50,850 --> 02:22:53,460
dude,
I in down in buckhead.

3007
02:22:53,461 --> 02:22:56,310
We be lined out of that motherfucker and
put guide.

3008
02:22:56,310 --> 02:22:57,600
The guy sitting next to her.
We were like,

3009
02:22:57,660 --> 02:22:59,150
oH,
he suck.

3010
02:23:00,420 --> 02:23:03,390
He's telling you like,
hey man,

3011
02:23:03,391 --> 02:23:05,460
she was a.
She was a good girlfriend except for all

3012
02:23:05,461 --> 02:23:06,294
this stuff,
but like she was the only one that got 

3013
02:23:08,941 --> 02:23:10,350
me into comedy,
which he said,

3014
02:23:10,351 --> 02:23:10,621
well,
what?

3015
02:23:10,621 --> 02:23:11,200
She said,
no,

3016
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:12,033
you were fine.
A little delusional about like how good 

3017
02:23:15,211 --> 02:23:16,830
you had to be to do it.
She was like,

3018
02:23:16,831 --> 02:23:17,730
yeah,
you're great.

3019
02:23:17,731 --> 02:23:18,930
That was great.
You handled it well.

3020
02:23:18,990 --> 02:23:22,130
You were in a bad situation.
Chris to krista medoc,

3021
02:23:22,460 --> 02:23:24,940
she's.
She was pretty right with.

3022
02:23:24,960 --> 02:23:25,793
That's your second time ever on stage.
Second time on stage at the comedy 

3023
02:23:28,801 --> 02:23:29,710
corner fence,
but,

3024
02:23:29,750 --> 02:23:30,583
but the no,
because fight somebody who when they 

3025
02:23:31,861 --> 02:23:32,940
said,
oh shit,

3026
02:23:32,970 --> 02:23:33,803
it's birdie.
Bert.

3027
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:34,913
The place went nuts.
I was the guy that they'd been fucking 

3028
02:23:38,071 --> 02:23:39,480
with all night.
They lOve this guy.

3029
02:23:39,510 --> 02:23:41,690
Like if he's you today,
you would just murder that crowd.

3030
02:23:42,580 --> 02:23:46,080
Getting in a time machine letting these 
motherfuckers know what's up.

3031
02:23:46,420 --> 02:23:49,950
Yeah,
just boom back.

3032
02:23:50,040 --> 02:23:51,170
Oh shIt.
It's birdie,

3033
02:23:51,300 --> 02:23:52,133
birdie 300,
80 percent of three 79 and he got flat 

3034
02:24:00,900 --> 02:24:03,720
feet,
flat feet.

3035
02:24:05,930 --> 02:24:06,763
He's aside 13 but not really fat ass 
feet and run a marathon because your 

3036
02:24:16,891 --> 02:24:21,891
feet so fat.
So what do you think you can do?

3037
02:24:25,030 --> 02:24:28,680
we got to go do the cath lawn.
If you can do this ridiculous thing that

3038
02:24:28,681 --> 02:24:29,870
you probably can't do.
Okay.

3039
02:24:30,430 --> 02:24:32,970
What by the way,
I'm going to regret,

3040
02:24:33,450 --> 02:24:35,220
uh,
this part of my life.

3041
02:24:35,340 --> 02:24:37,300
Why?
Because I don't mind that I don't.

3042
02:24:37,301 --> 02:24:39,630
I like,
I think I would like to challenge myself

3043
02:24:39,810 --> 02:24:43,050
to the yoga and the,
and the not drinking,

3044
02:24:43,051 --> 02:24:46,920
but I do want to incorporate it into us 
[inaudible] like I want it to be.

3045
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:49,700
I liked having people to talk shit to 
you on text.

3046
02:24:50,060 --> 02:24:50,893
Yeah.
Like,

3047
02:24:50,970 --> 02:24:53,730
and I know that you guys will be like,
are you drinking the night or whatever.

3048
02:24:53,790 --> 02:24:56,130
But like I'm gonna get a court people on
the outside,

3049
02:24:56,131 --> 02:24:58,110
but I don't know.
I think it should be.

3050
02:24:58,260 --> 02:25:01,140
I like to see the cap on idea.
Um,

3051
02:25:01,350 --> 02:25:03,080
I don't,
I don't have a problem.

3052
02:25:03,150 --> 02:25:03,983
Try and run a marathon.
But I do think tom said he didn't like 

3053
02:25:06,091 --> 02:25:07,680
the idea to me personally because he was
like,

3054
02:25:07,920 --> 02:25:10,670
there's just no payoff.
Like it's like you fall for sure.

3055
02:25:10,680 --> 02:25:11,670
Quit.
Well for sure.

3056
02:25:11,671 --> 02:25:12,504
Quit.
No.

3057
02:25:12,570 --> 02:25:14,720
So then what's the point?
It's not.

3058
02:25:15,510 --> 02:25:18,500
Maybe it was the weight loss challenge 
or the drinking.

3059
02:25:18,501 --> 02:25:19,980
Not drinking challenge.
You can keep up with.

3060
02:25:20,190 --> 02:25:21,330
Yeah,
I don't think you can do that,

3061
02:25:21,331 --> 02:25:22,920
but normal people could.
I'll do it.

3062
02:25:23,080 --> 02:25:24,110
People with that problem.
I'll do it.

3063
02:25:24,510 --> 02:25:27,010
Ninety days,
no one needs 30,

3064
02:25:27,020 --> 02:25:28,380
91 days.
Thirty days,

3065
02:25:28,600 --> 02:25:30,370
75 days.
Thirty two days.

3066
02:25:30,400 --> 02:25:31,420
Thirty days.
Thirty days.

3067
02:25:32,050 --> 02:25:33,830
Thirty two days.
Eight days.

3068
02:25:34,300 --> 02:25:39,040
So can I say you can't drink or be drunk
during all of us?

3069
02:25:40,250 --> 02:25:41,083
Get it through his veins.
Call are going to be fucking drunk the 

3070
02:25:45,791 --> 02:25:47,560
whole first night because it shouldn't 
be drink for six hours.

3071
02:25:47,700 --> 02:25:48,910
And he's telling me.
Ask you this though.

3072
02:25:48,911 --> 02:25:50,680
Seriously.
For our own peace of mind,

3073
02:25:50,681 --> 02:25:51,514
like all jokes aside,
we don't have to worry about withdrawal 

3074
02:25:54,881 --> 02:25:55,950
symptoms with you,
charlie.

3075
02:25:56,010 --> 02:25:57,220
I'm serious.
The metro,

3076
02:25:58,050 --> 02:26:00,070
the metro.
You think that we would rest easy.

3077
02:26:00,250 --> 02:26:02,000
I don't do this.
I say,

3078
02:26:02,010 --> 02:26:04,630
we don't do this unless you get the 
charcoal pills and have metro house.

3079
02:26:04,720 --> 02:26:05,830
Well,
I don't think that's good enough.

3080
02:26:06,370 --> 02:26:09,990
I mean if you're really going through 
the shakes were fine.

3081
02:26:10,780 --> 02:26:13,560
Can't belIeve where.
Can we have your doctor sign off on it?

3082
02:26:14,020 --> 02:26:15,850
One hundred percent.
Okay guys,

3083
02:26:15,890 --> 02:26:18,070
you can run a marathon.
EasY and he's in great shape.

3084
02:26:18,110 --> 02:26:19,390
Yeah,
no problem.

3085
02:26:19,480 --> 02:26:24,110
I hope I do know I'm going to be fine.
You're actually doctor,

3086
02:26:24,310 --> 02:26:27,370
not like fucking bullshit aside.
Like what?

3087
02:26:28,150 --> 02:26:30,920
What is the last day you didn't drink?
How long ago?

3088
02:26:31,490 --> 02:26:33,950
the wait.
We never even got to how much you drank.

3089
02:26:34,070 --> 02:26:34,903
Yeah.
How much do you still didn't say let's 

3090
02:26:36,400 --> 02:26:38,650
just do this.
Let's just do it for a regular day.

3091
02:26:38,710 --> 02:26:40,480
Like what is that?
Then we'll do a travel guy.

3092
02:26:40,570 --> 02:26:44,260
I'll just tell you a little story.
Tom said this is better than the game of

3093
02:26:44,261 --> 02:26:45,270
thrones one.
Okay.

3094
02:26:45,310 --> 02:26:46,810
But how much do you normally drink 
though?

3095
02:26:46,860 --> 02:26:47,750
for just do it?
Yeah.

3096
02:26:47,751 --> 02:26:49,250
Let's just,
let's just tell a story.

3097
02:26:49,650 --> 02:26:50,770
Just about to,
uh,

3098
02:26:50,910 --> 02:26:51,743
yesterday we had a half a handle of 
tito's and we were going over to our 

3099
02:26:55,021 --> 02:26:55,854
friend's house and of course,
and I said we should get a full bottle 

3100
02:26:59,261 --> 02:27:00,094
of tito's thinking that there will be 
more people there that would want 

3101
02:27:01,991 --> 02:27:02,824
tito's.
yeah.

3102
02:27:02,920 --> 02:27:05,770
And she said,
I'm being dead serious.

3103
02:27:05,800 --> 02:27:08,830
If you go through a half handled tito's,
you have a legit problem.

3104
02:27:08,860 --> 02:27:09,693
Who said this?
Leanne and I still had an entity that 

3105
02:27:11,531 --> 02:27:12,640
was when I came home last night.

3106
02:27:12,940 --> 02:27:15,520
So that's after the problem.
It's a lot,

3107
02:27:15,550 --> 02:27:18,520
but that's a lot of booze.
And after you cleared anotHer handle,

3108
02:27:18,550 --> 02:27:19,071
like this is.
No,

3109
02:27:19,071 --> 02:27:19,331
no,
no,

3110
02:27:19,331 --> 02:27:19,740
no,
no.

3111
02:27:19,740 --> 02:27:22,180
What's it just handle it?
It's the big thing.

3112
02:27:22,190 --> 02:27:25,250
It's probably drank at the party.
No,

3113
02:27:25,290 --> 02:27:26,123
it's more than.
That.

3114
02:27:26,630 --> 02:27:29,380
Handles more than that.
With the actual handle.

3115
02:27:30,650 --> 02:27:31,960
That's why they call the handle.
Yeah.

3116
02:27:32,440 --> 02:27:37,150
When's the last time he didn't do that?
A few days ago.

3117
02:27:37,530 --> 02:27:39,100
So few days ago.
What happened?

3118
02:27:39,130 --> 02:27:40,330
Do you drink at all?
No,

3119
02:27:40,331 --> 02:27:41,164
I didn't drink at all.
Fifty nine ounces or just sleep through 

3120
02:27:43,121 --> 02:27:45,160
the day?
Thirty ounces.

3121
02:27:45,430 --> 02:27:46,263
So essentially you drank.
Did you play music on that once a 

3122
02:27:50,370 --> 02:27:52,990
quarter?
A quarter of a handle to one shot.

3123
02:27:53,030 --> 02:27:53,863
Avant is one and a half ounce.
So you're basically drinking like 50 

3124
02:27:56,441 --> 02:27:57,274
ounces.
That's what you're watching me drink 

3125
02:27:57,971 --> 02:28:00,850
right now,
but I'm barely anything by the way,

3126
02:28:01,320 --> 02:28:02,980
but I.
I'm still buzzed.

3127
02:28:03,280 --> 02:28:04,113
What do you mean the amount of booze 
you're talking about that much if 

3128
02:28:08,651 --> 02:28:09,200
that's.
No,

3129
02:28:09,200 --> 02:28:09,600
no,
no,

3130
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:11,410
it's fine.
No,

3131
02:28:11,630 --> 02:28:13,980
don't bullshit.
Bullshit me that.

3132
02:28:14,110 --> 02:28:15,850
Yeah,
of tito's a lot.

3133
02:28:15,970 --> 02:28:20,770
If he can drink a half of one of those 
cordage I said a quarter.

3134
02:28:20,940 --> 02:28:22,760
Okay.
Hang on one second.

3135
02:28:22,910 --> 02:28:25,360
I can also drink a good point.
I think it's going.

3136
02:28:25,370 --> 02:28:30,370
I noted that it's also scotch much last 
10 or 15 shots.

3137
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,940
30th five shots in the handle.
There's 35 shots in the hand,

3138
02:28:35,780 --> 02:28:38,780
so half of that 15 shots.
I'm drinking seven shots.

3139
02:28:39,320 --> 02:28:42,410
Shots,
shots,

3140
02:28:44,210 --> 02:28:46,650
shots with that?
Three hours?

3141
02:28:46,930 --> 02:28:51,650
60 shots over 35.
One and a half ounces.

3142
02:28:51,680 --> 02:28:53,240
I'm saying if I drank that much I'd for 
sure bar.

3143
02:28:53,660 --> 02:28:54,141
Oh,
okay.

3144
02:28:54,141 --> 02:28:54,800
Yeah,
you're right.

3145
02:28:54,800 --> 02:28:55,633
You're right.
Yeah.

3146
02:28:55,750 --> 02:28:57,950
I feel like I don't want this to get 
away from anyone.

3147
02:28:58,070 --> 02:29:00,020
What about on a flying day?
Okay,

3148
02:29:01,390 --> 02:29:03,090
what's good?
What's going on?

3149
02:29:03,110 --> 02:29:05,420
Maybe I'm being dead serious.
You guys are my friends.

3150
02:29:05,430 --> 02:29:06,263
You.
We'd love your shit.

3151
02:29:06,430 --> 02:29:07,940
Yeah,
I'll be honest.

3152
02:29:08,360 --> 02:29:10,880
But let's,
let's not go fucking overboard.

3153
02:29:11,280 --> 02:29:12,500
Boom.
We're going to make Jokes though,

3154
02:29:12,800 --> 02:29:16,490
you know,
listening to remember.

3155
02:29:16,491 --> 02:29:18,590
I like you guys.
We'd like you to you guys.

3156
02:29:18,591 --> 02:29:19,251
We're like,
okay.

3157
02:29:19,251 --> 02:29:20,330
Here we go.
Do you think it's Funny?

3158
02:29:20,331 --> 02:29:21,380
That's great.
Okay,

3159
02:29:21,381 --> 02:29:22,280
go ahead.
So,

3160
02:29:22,281 --> 02:29:23,480
uh,
we'll just shoot.

3161
02:29:23,481 --> 02:29:24,950
An average flight is at 7:00
AM.

3162
02:29:25,490 --> 02:29:27,160
Bars are open.
Uh,

3163
02:29:27,230 --> 02:29:31,460
I bring a full bottles with tito.
Little baby bottles in my bag.

3164
02:29:32,060 --> 02:29:33,890
But you drink on the way to get them in 
your bag.

3165
02:29:33,920 --> 02:29:35,200
Let me just tell you guys.
Okay.

3166
02:29:35,900 --> 02:29:36,733
I pack him in the side.
You could allow allowed to travel wIth 

3167
02:29:37,941 --> 02:29:42,170
up to eight bag that you check your bag 
in my bag.

3168
02:29:42,250 --> 02:29:46,160
Like a could bring on eight,
eight little bottles.

3169
02:29:46,190 --> 02:29:47,500
Little bottles.
Yup.

3170
02:29:47,570 --> 02:29:48,950
I'll bring it to Singapore.

3171
02:29:49,490 --> 02:29:50,600
You're allowed eIght.
So you bring it,

3172
02:29:50,870 --> 02:29:52,450
bring it,
bring liquid on a plane.

3173
02:29:52,610 --> 02:29:56,900
It's small doses to liquid liquid 
drinks.

3174
02:29:56,960 --> 02:29:59,810
Like a little tiny baby shots the size 
of your library.

3175
02:29:59,900 --> 02:30:01,910
I'm saying I trust the extra on that.
Yeah,

3176
02:30:02,110 --> 02:30:03,860
I fly a lot.
I love you.

3177
02:30:03,880 --> 02:30:04,910
I'm just.
I'm stunned.

3178
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:05,833
You think on the job like a drink.
I think the thing is that like if you 

3179
02:30:08,631 --> 02:30:10,310
walked through with this and a little 
bit,

3180
02:30:10,340 --> 02:30:11,173
they say no way.
It's that he has a small bottle with a 

3181
02:30:15,801 --> 02:30:19,700
small amount of that volume but also a 
tricky problem.

3182
02:30:20,060 --> 02:30:20,893
Right.
So they must have at that point look at 

3183
02:30:21,621 --> 02:30:22,341
him and go,
yeah,

3184
02:30:22,341 --> 02:30:22,851
okay,
sure.

3185
02:30:22,851 --> 02:30:24,050
Yeah.
You need this medicine,

3186
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:25,960
those little bottles.
That's crazy.

3187
02:30:25,961 --> 02:30:27,450
It's a crazy number.
And so.

3188
02:30:27,470 --> 02:30:28,303
But this,
you put those in your bag but you've 

3189
02:30:29,571 --> 02:30:31,190
also made a drink before you left the 
house.

3190
02:30:31,220 --> 02:30:31,940
Nope.
No,

3191
02:30:31,940 --> 02:30:32,550
we're talking.
I,

3192
02:30:32,550 --> 02:30:33,383
I'm talking to my worst travel day and 
this is on the rig on a sunday when I 

3193
02:30:37,821 --> 02:30:38,660
fly home.
No,

3194
02:30:38,661 --> 02:30:42,750
I want an average day.
Let's just start with way back.

3195
02:30:43,490 --> 02:30:46,550
So you get to the airport.
Yeah.

3196
02:30:46,920 --> 02:30:47,753
A don't eat anything.
Don't eat anything because there's 

3197
02:30:50,751 --> 02:30:52,780
nothing in the airport.
It's just going to give it away.

3198
02:30:54,110 --> 02:30:54,943
But I'm still concerned with my food 
intake so I won't have like an egg 

3199
02:30:58,281 --> 02:31:01,670
sandwich or that protein.
Oh,

3200
02:31:01,671 --> 02:31:02,920
okay.
I guess the better than eating it,

3201
02:31:02,921 --> 02:31:03,754
I guess.
Yeah.

3202
02:31:03,880 --> 02:31:05,440
So then,
so you,

3203
02:31:06,610 --> 02:31:07,443
you get to the airport,
you get through security and then what 

3204
02:31:10,401 --> 02:31:11,234
do you do a go find a place to scout the
food court for who has started foam 

3205
02:31:16,131 --> 02:31:17,930
cups.
Because if you have paper cups,

3206
02:31:18,110 --> 02:31:18,943
the vodka will cut the seam and your 
drink and collapse on your lap 

3207
02:31:21,631 --> 02:31:22,464
sometimes.

3208
02:31:22,670 --> 02:31:25,830
So I find it's got a place for styrofoam
cups or plastic cups.

3209
02:31:25,860 --> 02:31:27,210
Mcdonald's.
Shout out to mcdonald's,

3210
02:31:27,720 --> 02:31:28,980
go over,
say hey,

3211
02:31:28,981 --> 02:31:30,240
can I get an orange juice?
And a big,

3212
02:31:30,290 --> 02:31:31,123
a 32 ounce cup of ice.
And then I go into the bathroom or 

3213
02:31:33,571 --> 02:31:36,840
pretend take shit a crack for.
Sounds like a proud guY.

3214
02:31:38,180 --> 02:31:39,013
Bottles for them in the cup.
Pour the orange juIce and pants off 

3215
02:31:41,941 --> 02:31:46,200
while you're doing this.
So you pour the orange juice?

3216
02:31:46,201 --> 02:31:46,831
I do,
I do.

3217
02:31:46,831 --> 02:31:48,840
I do take a dump while you're doing 
this.

3218
02:31:48,870 --> 02:31:49,703
I take some time for the sometimes yeah,
sometimes you're in position to take a 

3219
02:31:54,511 --> 02:31:55,344
dump during a naked sadness.
I get so excited when I sit down and 

3220
02:31:59,891 --> 02:32:02,010
it's a warm toilette.
How long does it take you to get through

3221
02:32:02,011 --> 02:32:04,050
that drink?
I don't drink it.

3222
02:32:04,051 --> 02:32:06,530
So you put them all in before and sorry 
for,

3223
02:32:06,540 --> 02:32:11,220
for in vivo and go to the and then go to
the airplane and Just wait.

3224
02:32:11,460 --> 02:32:14,700
And then,
and I now for me personally,

3225
02:32:14,880 --> 02:32:17,310
my anxiety is cut in half because I know
I have a cocktail if I need one,

3226
02:32:17,490 --> 02:32:20,310
God damn.
And then I get on the plane,

3227
02:32:20,650 --> 02:32:23,260
I sip it and I pass out.
What was the last gentleman?

3228
02:32:23,650 --> 02:32:25,110
And you generally don't drink those 
other four?

3229
02:32:26,080 --> 02:32:26,940
He drank them up.
Maybe.

3230
02:32:26,941 --> 02:32:29,690
Maybe I do.
Maybe I do like he had eight I thought.

3231
02:32:29,880 --> 02:32:31,050
Oh no,
no.

3232
02:32:31,051 --> 02:32:33,150
I just drink for because I.
Because I want for,

3233
02:32:33,151 --> 02:32:34,680
for the flight safety,
for the flight home.

3234
02:32:34,760 --> 02:32:38,130
Oh yeah.
These rItuals or like I'm sure.

3235
02:32:38,180 --> 02:32:40,230
I mean so that's going to be a really 
tough time.

3236
02:32:40,270 --> 02:32:45,270
Just flew sober one year ago was a 
phoenix.

3237
02:32:45,550 --> 02:32:47,580
Not a big flight,
but I talked to your wife about it.

3238
02:32:47,660 --> 02:32:49,170
Uh,
what I,

3239
02:32:49,200 --> 02:32:50,033
what I've noticed is if I did a row of 
unassisted sleeps and then the night 

3240
02:32:54,871 --> 02:32:56,370
before the flight took a xanax.

3241
02:32:56,370 --> 02:32:57,810
Yeah,
at like five.

3242
02:32:58,260 --> 02:33:01,170
Then when I woke up the xanax was 
effectively still in my system and there

3243
02:33:01,171 --> 02:33:03,960
was no panic and uh,
and I flew.

3244
02:33:03,961 --> 02:33:07,980
I flew to Minnesota sober and back sober
and I was like,

3245
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:09,450
ooh.
Uh,

3246
02:33:09,470 --> 02:33:11,970
and then I did phoenix and then I did 
the hot wings thing,

3247
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,250
hot challenge,
and I the next night I was like,

3248
02:33:14,430 --> 02:33:16,220
my stomach's fucked.
I was an panic.

3249
02:33:16,670 --> 02:33:20,610
The panic from just how my brain works.
What do you mean?

3250
02:33:20,611 --> 02:33:23,070
Like what do you thinks is from doing x 
10 college?

3251
02:33:23,160 --> 02:33:24,390
what do you center on?
What do you,

3252
02:33:24,391 --> 02:33:25,900
what do you.
is that a phrase I like?

3253
02:33:26,450 --> 02:33:30,450
Is it a fright or just overall panic?
That's more like a dread anxiety,

3254
02:33:30,451 --> 02:33:32,360
right?
Being up in the air.

3255
02:33:32,470 --> 02:33:33,303
dread of the fact that I can't get out 
and then it might explode at any second 

3256
02:33:35,671 --> 02:33:36,570
and I can't stop that.

3257
02:33:36,600 --> 02:33:38,700
And then I just like right now.
Right?

3258
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:40,260
Right now you're gonna blow up right 
now.

3259
02:33:40,261 --> 02:33:41,590
I'm going to pull up.
He had that thought.

3260
02:33:42,300 --> 02:33:47,220
If I'm sober man on a flight,
I cry sometimes like the legit cry.

3261
02:33:47,430 --> 02:33:49,520
So I have to wear bring sunglasses on.
Dude.

3262
02:33:49,530 --> 02:33:53,040
I am so ritualistic on airplanes.
You have no fucking idea.

3263
02:33:53,580 --> 02:33:54,930
I have.
I have to drink.

3264
02:33:54,931 --> 02:33:55,764
I have to have a cocktail when I get on 
the plane because if I don't have it 

3265
02:33:58,260 --> 02:33:59,340
then I started panicking.
I can't,

3266
02:33:59,400 --> 02:34:00,233
I can't take a xanax because sometimes 
you get delayed and then you just 

3267
02:34:02,131 --> 02:34:02,964
fucking.
How much would you drink on that flight 

3268
02:34:04,051 --> 02:34:04,884
to Singapore?
You think the foods that give you free 

3269
02:34:07,561 --> 02:34:09,840
boots,
those flights aren't super bad.

3270
02:34:09,841 --> 02:34:11,490
They're not as bad for me.
let me ask you this.

3271
02:34:11,800 --> 02:34:12,633
Talk about.
Have you ever thought about trying to 

3272
02:34:14,281 --> 02:34:17,710
manage the way your mind about things

3273
02:34:18,250 --> 02:34:20,140
instead of like thinking about 
medicating it?

3274
02:34:20,150 --> 02:34:20,983
No.
Just try to put yourself in a position 

3275
02:34:23,231 --> 02:34:24,064
where you try to manage your paranoia or
your thoughts and guys are coming in to 

3276
02:34:27,640 --> 02:34:32,560
sort of reject them and use some 
meditation techniques to relax.

3277
02:34:32,710 --> 02:34:33,640
Like,
but what have yOu ever done?

3278
02:34:33,641 --> 02:34:34,630
Like,
like meditation,

3279
02:34:34,631 --> 02:34:35,464
while I haven't done,
I haven't done tom and everyone 

3280
02:34:37,251 --> 02:34:41,080
suggested to him transcendental 
meditation.

3281
02:34:41,970 --> 02:34:42,791
That's a weird one,
right?

3282
02:34:42,791 --> 02:34:44,680
A lot of people think that's like very 
cultish.

3283
02:34:45,060 --> 02:34:47,170
You know,
There was a lot of criticism of that,

3284
02:34:47,171 --> 02:34:49,990
but I know a lot of like super 
successful people like that.

3285
02:34:50,330 --> 02:34:52,090
It's a lot of weird articles on 
meditation.

3286
02:34:52,091 --> 02:34:55,510
People get like a,
they get weird about other people trying

3287
02:34:55,511 --> 02:34:56,344
to be enlightened.
It's really interesting like people 

3288
02:34:57,671 --> 02:35:02,671
start shitting on people like 
mindfulness is bullshit bullshit because

3289
02:35:03,401 --> 02:35:06,370
it seems like if you're writing 
mindfulness is bullshit.

3290
02:35:06,580 --> 02:35:10,840
Like for you it's probably bullsHit 
because you're writing a fucking article

3291
02:35:10,990 --> 02:35:11,823
on people trying to look at things 
objectively with clarity and be in the 

3292
02:35:15,281 --> 02:35:20,281
moment instead of like be scattered and 
cast about by the momentum of their past

3293
02:35:20,531 --> 02:35:23,260
and all the things happening around them
where it takes them out of control.

3294
02:35:23,261 --> 02:35:25,010
The idea is to try to like be in the 
moment like,

3295
02:35:25,040 --> 02:35:26,170
sure,
how could that be bullshit?

3296
02:35:26,490 --> 02:35:28,660
It can't be.
It's like it literally can't be bullshit

3297
02:35:28,840 --> 02:35:32,200
because you're trying to like just be 
like an easier person to deal with,

3298
02:35:32,380 --> 02:35:33,213
get through life smoother.
How can it makes me like people of 

3299
02:35:35,411 --> 02:35:38,050
faith.
I would love to have faith stage.

3300
02:35:38,051 --> 02:35:38,884
I loved up faith,
great benefits to religious beliefs as 

3301
02:35:41,591 --> 02:35:43,150
long as they're positive religious 
beliefs.

3302
02:35:43,151 --> 02:35:46,090
If you could have a perfect religion 
like a religion that didn't have all the

3303
02:35:46,091 --> 02:35:50,000
contradictions and hypocrisy and crazy 
shit about like killing people that were

3304
02:35:50,001 --> 02:35:50,834
two different types of cloth or hey,
the weird shit that is in any ancient 

3305
02:35:55,181 --> 02:35:57,250
text that gets translated into modern 
times.

3306
02:35:57,510 --> 02:36:00,640
If you could create something that gave 
you like a are like a rock solid,

3307
02:36:00,790 --> 02:36:01,623
sensible ethic that was based on like 
science and the reality is what we know 

3308
02:36:04,721 --> 02:36:07,690
and how vulnerable we really are and how
big the universe really is.

3309
02:36:07,720 --> 02:36:08,553
If somebody can read,
rewrite something where they weren't 

3310
02:36:10,331 --> 02:36:13,180
trying to control people with it,
they weren't asking for donations.

3311
02:36:13,360 --> 02:36:14,193
They were Just trying to like set out a 
way to look at the world and a clear 

3312
02:36:17,291 --> 02:36:18,124
Framework that's open to all 
possibilities but allows you to move 

3313
02:36:21,341 --> 02:36:22,174
through.
This time and space in the most 

3314
02:36:24,101 --> 02:36:27,010
harmonious manner with our fellow 
brothers and sisters,

3315
02:36:27,040 --> 02:36:29,620
that's what we all missing because we're
too smart for the old,

3316
02:36:29,621 --> 02:36:30,454
stupid shit about people walking on 
water and coming back from the dead 

3317
02:36:32,321 --> 02:36:33,154
people.
I could,

3318
02:36:33,350 --> 02:36:35,630
if maybe it's an allegory,
maybe it's a parable.

3319
02:36:35,670 --> 02:36:39,490
Maybe it's based on some ancient story 
that means something different,

3320
02:36:39,491 --> 02:36:41,320
but we lost it all in the translation.

3321
02:36:41,650 --> 02:36:42,483
We need something else because we're too
open ended and people get super 

3322
02:36:46,360 --> 02:36:47,193
concerned with it.
Not meaning anything ultimately at the 

3323
02:36:49,661 --> 02:36:52,090
end,
but what it means for sure.

3324
02:36:52,210 --> 02:36:53,043
Something is right now.
If you have good friends and you enjoy 

3325
02:36:55,451 --> 02:36:57,100
your life,
then it means something.

3326
02:36:57,101 --> 02:36:58,210
For sure.
For right now.

3327
02:36:58,240 --> 02:36:59,073
There's no denying that.
Like in the moment it means something 

3328
02:37:01,481 --> 02:37:02,980
and you can be an ils.
YOu could be.

3329
02:37:02,981 --> 02:37:03,814
You know,
you have this fatalistic view of the 

3330
02:37:05,141 --> 02:37:08,500
future,
but if you look at the moment right now,

3331
02:37:08,501 --> 02:37:11,590
it always means something.
It always means something to be enjoying

3332
02:37:11,591 --> 02:37:13,360
yourself.
That's all you have.

3333
02:37:13,390 --> 02:37:15,500
You definitely said some things that 
align with buddhism though.

3334
02:37:15,860 --> 02:37:16,090
Yeah,

3335
02:37:16,090 --> 02:37:18,150
that for sure.
Yeah.

3336
02:37:18,530 --> 02:37:21,110
It's all that was all connected 
together.

3337
02:37:21,380 --> 02:37:22,213
People have had all these ideas for 
thousands of years where they realized 

3338
02:37:25,430 --> 02:37:27,410
like moments in their life where they 
got it right.

3339
02:37:27,690 --> 02:37:30,680
You know those moments in your life 
where you have a near death experience,

3340
02:37:30,681 --> 02:37:31,514
you almost get run over by a buffalo or 
something like that and you just 

3341
02:37:32,931 --> 02:37:34,730
standing there looking at each other and
it all makes sense.

3342
02:37:34,760 --> 02:37:35,490
Yeah.
what,

3343
02:37:35,490 --> 02:37:38,450
what matters is like love and friendship
and the moment,

3344
02:37:38,451 --> 02:37:39,284
the that,
the life that you're experiencing right 

3345
02:37:40,341 --> 02:37:40,970
now.
I.

3346
02:37:40,970 --> 02:37:42,400
This is cool right now,
right?

3347
02:37:42,410 --> 02:37:43,130
Yeah.
Like,

3348
02:37:43,130 --> 02:37:44,900
remember That time you didn't drink for 
five days?

3349
02:37:45,350 --> 02:37:46,183
That was a long time ago,
but it's probably the way I remember 

3350
02:37:48,261 --> 02:37:52,640
riding a bike for the first time I made 
the decision either way.

3351
02:37:52,641 --> 02:37:53,270
No,
you're not.

3352
02:37:53,270 --> 02:37:54,260
Hey,
can I tell you something?

3353
02:37:54,530 --> 02:37:56,210
Once again,
we're the secret time here.

3354
02:37:56,400 --> 02:37:57,233
Uh,
the last time I didn't drink for a long 

3355
02:37:59,571 --> 02:38:00,404
stretch.
I had this moment of clarity where I 

3356
02:38:01,971 --> 02:38:02,804
went.
I haven't made a lot of decisions as an 

3357
02:38:05,391 --> 02:38:08,180
adult sober.
Like I didn't,

3358
02:38:08,181 --> 02:38:09,014
I didn't pick to get into standup sober.
I was the number one party in the 

3359
02:38:11,090 --> 02:38:13,370
coUntry.
I'll just FuCking moved to New York.

3360
02:38:13,580 --> 02:38:14,413
Do you believe those rankings?
Do you think there's no one out there 

3361
02:38:19,131 --> 02:38:22,400
that was fucking doing it up to the 
university of detroit at a party animal.

3362
02:38:29,260 --> 02:38:30,093
Rolling stone.
Never contacted motherfuckers into a 

3363
02:38:37,280 --> 02:38:42,280
carnal mind.
There's definitely some maniacs.

3364
02:38:45,210 --> 02:38:48,690
Oh,
there were guys in my math.

3365
02:38:50,780 --> 02:38:54,660
There was a guy named collin who little 
bowl.

3366
02:38:54,661 --> 02:38:55,494
One time it was so high he passed out 
and the bowl landed on his cheek and it 

3367
02:38:58,261 --> 02:38:59,094
burned up.
What's the most embarrassing thing 

3368
02:39:01,951 --> 02:39:03,360
you've ever done?
The where you fell asleep.

3369
02:39:04,350 --> 02:39:05,183
I couldn't tell you one.
One.

3370
02:39:05,190 --> 02:39:06,023
I did it awake when you felt sober.
I'll give you ever gone down on a girl 

3371
02:39:09,241 --> 02:39:11,220
and fell asleep on her pussy.
No way.

3372
02:39:11,390 --> 02:39:12,230
No,
no.

3373
02:39:12,250 --> 02:39:13,230
You have.
I did.

3374
02:39:13,290 --> 02:39:16,710
Jesus christ.
Oh my gosh.

3375
02:39:17,210 --> 02:39:20,610
You have narcolepsy.
Ring pussy.

3376
02:39:20,730 --> 02:39:22,530
Shit.
If it was wonderful,

3377
02:39:22,800 --> 02:39:27,800
but I was delivering newspapers like it 
was gone with the wind newspapers in the

3378
02:39:31,500 --> 02:39:32,333
standard a bit late,
so it was getting up every morning like 

3379
02:39:33,451 --> 02:39:34,284
5:00
in the morning and I was working every 

3380
02:39:35,940 --> 02:39:37,470
night and then during the day I would 
work too.

3381
02:39:37,471 --> 02:39:38,304
I do do a bunch of different shit during
the day just trying to like just pay my 

3382
02:39:41,281 --> 02:39:41,760
bills.

3383
02:39:41,760 --> 02:39:43,670
I was always tired.
I was always tired.

3384
02:39:43,671 --> 02:39:45,150
I was working for a private 
investigator.

3385
02:39:45,330 --> 02:39:46,163
That was like,
a lot of what I did was drive around 

3386
02:39:47,170 --> 02:39:48,940
this private investigator following 
people.

3387
02:39:49,610 --> 02:39:50,443
Yeah.
It was a lot of in insurance cases and 

3388
02:39:51,691 --> 02:39:54,210
shit like that.
but meanwhile I was always tired,

3389
02:39:54,230 --> 02:39:58,650
like so tired and one time I was going 
down and I just fucking conked out.

3390
02:40:00,290 --> 02:40:02,970
What did she do?
She got so mad.

3391
02:40:03,540 --> 02:40:06,390
She gets so mad and I might try to do 
that.

3392
02:40:06,391 --> 02:40:09,030
Like I'm not.
I'm not happy to be that tired.

3393
02:40:09,031 --> 02:40:11,220
It's not like you're boring.
Like I'm breaking myself,

3394
02:40:11,310 --> 02:40:13,140
broke down.
I'm breaking myself.

3395
02:40:13,290 --> 02:40:13,980
Working out.

3396
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:17,070
I was still kickboxing.
I was doing stand up comedy.

3397
02:40:17,130 --> 02:40:19,710
I was getting up in the morning.
I was delivering newspapers,

3398
02:40:20,080 --> 02:40:24,690
falling asleep when I was.
I was working all day.

3399
02:40:24,900 --> 02:40:27,370
Then I was getting to the gym that I was
sparring,

3400
02:40:28,650 --> 02:40:29,483
that I was going out and doing standup 
and after I was doing standup I go over 

3401
02:40:31,970 --> 02:40:33,900
house and eat pussy sometimes it just 
black.

3402
02:40:34,950 --> 02:40:35,783
She was like halfway to comments.
You could feel it though the horizon 

3403
02:40:37,681 --> 02:40:38,451
coming.
And I was like,

3404
02:40:38,451 --> 02:40:38,851
wait,
what?

3405
02:40:38,851 --> 02:40:40,740
Oh come on.
We got so mad at me.

3406
02:40:40,800 --> 02:40:42,750
I was only 21 or whatever it was.

3407
02:40:45,110 --> 02:40:46,510
That's good.
Move.

3408
02:40:48,560 --> 02:40:50,820
Come in there.
Sometimes it happens.

3409
02:40:51,150 --> 02:40:54,510
You got to put ice in her bus,
trying to get a third peanut butter.

3410
02:40:55,360 --> 02:40:57,340
I fell asleep like a,
you know,

3411
02:40:57,350 --> 02:40:58,183
like when like college,
like after making out but like you're 

3412
02:41:00,091 --> 02:41:00,924

3414
02:41:06,440 --> 02:41:08,300

3415
02:41:12,890 --> 02:41:14,910
What time do we have left?

3416
02:41:15,180 --> 02:41:16,530

3422
02:41:33,181 --> 02:41:34,680

02:42:58,160 --> 02:42:59,640
He,
I mean it's not exactly what.

3454
02:42:59,641 --> 02:43:04,641
They did a great job and they're all 
fatter than me.

3455
02:43:06,690 --> 02:43:08,850
I know you meet them.
I meet them.

3456
02:43:09,120 --> 02:43:11,920
Hold on.
Joe fatter than me.

3457
02:43:12,380 --> 02:43:16,930
And you and you see their moms and their
moms are fucking obese,

3458
02:43:17,140 --> 02:43:19,940
like 400 pounds and then I guy a fat 
fuck.

3459
02:43:20,090 --> 02:43:21,520
And you were like at the time you were 
like,

3460
02:43:21,521 --> 02:43:24,070
I'm the same category as you're 
medically medically I.

3461
02:43:24,071 --> 02:43:25,090
Yeah.
Medically I was.

3462
02:43:25,240 --> 02:43:29,530
Did you ever consider the possibility of
those people are like tests given to you

3463
02:43:29,531 --> 02:43:33,970
by the universe to see if you can 
navigate the waters of stupidity without

3464
02:43:34,570 --> 02:43:35,403
barely getting wet.
You can't get that back to skirt around 

3465
02:43:37,151 --> 02:43:37,984
them with like a kito,
like an old steven seagal demonstration 

3466
02:43:40,391 --> 02:43:42,520
video.
I wish move.

3467
02:43:42,680 --> 02:43:43,513
I,
I just,

3468
02:43:43,660 --> 02:43:45,250
I don't like confrontation,
so I just go,

3469
02:43:45,251 --> 02:43:47,760
yeah,
just glide path.

3470
02:43:47,770 --> 02:43:49,110
So you're better now.
I think less.

3471
02:43:49,270 --> 02:43:50,103
I think if we weighed you and we will at
times you'll be less than you were 

3472
02:43:52,121 --> 02:43:52,990
during the way and challenge.

3473
02:43:52,990 --> 02:43:55,420
I drank a lot of tito's and soda.
You got okay.

3474
02:43:55,421 --> 02:43:57,340
You got to piss a few times.
So we're in october,

3475
02:43:57,620 --> 02:43:59,170

We'll get that tight.

3476
02:43:59,171 --> 02:44:00,340

3477
02:44:00,720 --> 02:44:02,890

02:44:02,891 --> 02:44:03,560

3479
02:44:03,560 --> 02:44:04,690

No pills?

3481
02:44:07,391 --> 02:44:08,940
No anytHing.
Step charcoal pills if you need them.

3482
02:44:08,941 --> 02:44:11,060
What's your will?
Definitely serious.

3483
02:44:11,140 --> 02:44:15,550
And your doctor's note.
We need to know a real number.

3484
02:44:15,551 --> 02:44:18,420
Like how many drinks do you drink a day?
We never got clay.

3485
02:44:18,470 --> 02:44:20,650
Wait,
what's the physical on top of this?

3486
02:44:20,690 --> 02:44:22,300
This dead?
Four shots.

3487
02:44:22,880 --> 02:44:25,810
Four shots of a.
Of a run of vodka.

3488
02:44:25,990 --> 02:44:27,610
How many shannon,
when you land you get more.

3489
02:44:27,730 --> 02:44:30,040
How many drinks do you have in a normal 
day?

3490
02:44:30,670 --> 02:44:32,170
Today's what?
Monday?

3491
02:44:32,260 --> 02:44:33,880
Well normal.
It's not normal.

3492
02:44:33,980 --> 02:44:35,770
We're all right now.
I'll tell you right now,

3493
02:44:36,010 --> 02:44:37,160
it's labor day,
right?

3494
02:44:37,270 --> 02:44:39,580
You got to get a job.
I know that if I smoke weed,

3495
02:44:39,581 --> 02:44:43,060
my alcohol intake disappears entirely 
and I start slowing down.

3496
02:44:43,360 --> 02:44:45,550
Hence a three hour conversation.
I've only had that.

3497
02:44:45,551 --> 02:44:48,970
That's something that's an okay and a 
few sips of your scotch.

3498
02:44:48,971 --> 02:44:50,360
but I didn't like it.
So I went back.

3499
02:44:51,500 --> 02:44:52,610
I don't like scotch.
it did.

3500
02:44:52,620 --> 02:44:55,150
Reminds me of medicine.
So fucking rude.

3501
02:44:55,210 --> 02:44:56,043
and so I know that if I go to toMmy's 
I'm going to loosen up and I'm going to 

3502
02:44:59,161 --> 02:45:00,210
work.
Throw on speedos.

3503
02:45:00,211 --> 02:45:01,410
We're all getting the pool.
Yeah.

3504
02:45:01,540 --> 02:45:02,680
Yeah.
And then,

3505
02:45:02,681 --> 02:45:03,430
uh,
I,

3506
02:45:03,430 --> 02:45:06,730
I wouldn't be shocked if I'd killed this
whole bottle today in one day.

3507
02:45:06,770 --> 02:45:08,050
No,
I don't think anyone would be shocked.

3508
02:45:08,110 --> 02:45:08,943
All right.
What else?

3509
02:45:10,180 --> 02:45:11,013
Shocked.
Shocked is not a thing that came up in 

3510
02:45:13,721 --> 02:45:16,150
that conversation.
And so what I'll do is,

3511
02:45:16,151 --> 02:45:17,570
uh,
I'll wean my,

3512
02:45:17,770 --> 02:45:20,830
I will wean myself from booze,
but we didn't ever give us a number.

3513
02:45:21,370 --> 02:45:22,600
How many a day?
Oh yeah.

3514
02:45:22,810 --> 02:45:24,520
How many drinks a day?
How many drinks is that?

3515
02:45:24,550 --> 02:45:27,060
How many drinks at a bar?
Deliberate.

3516
02:45:27,130 --> 02:45:28,570
Single drink.
You know how many hours,

3517
02:45:29,050 --> 02:45:30,520
how many of you had doubled again?
Doubled.

3518
02:45:30,521 --> 02:45:31,354
Tito's and soda.
How many if what do you mean the number 

3519
02:45:34,440 --> 02:45:37,090
of drinks?
If you're hanging out at a bar,

3520
02:45:37,120 --> 02:45:39,460
let's say you're at a bar to drink.
We're not playing.

3521
02:45:39,840 --> 02:45:41,610
We're not playing dumb.
I'm afraid to be honest.

3522
02:45:41,770 --> 02:45:42,720
Be honest,
be honest,

3523
02:45:43,340 --> 02:45:44,460
be honest.
We not funny.

3524
02:45:44,470 --> 02:45:45,303
You probably get like six would 
definitely be like a very comfortable 

3525
02:45:51,161 --> 02:45:51,971
number.
What do you mean?

3526
02:45:51,971 --> 02:45:55,410
What do you mean comfortable?
Six double six.

3527
02:45:55,420 --> 02:45:59,460
Double 12 drinks in a bartender's poor.
Comfortable number.

3528
02:45:59,470 --> 02:46:03,250
You mean like that's mean a line.
And are you hammered at the end of that?

3529
02:46:03,460 --> 02:46:04,293
Yeah,
and I,

3530
02:46:04,390 --> 02:46:06,100
by the way now if I,
if I drink.

3531
02:46:06,520 --> 02:46:07,900
So when the.
Hold on,

3532
02:46:07,901 --> 02:46:10,100
slow down.
If I drink at

3533
02:46:10,100 --> 02:46:14,150
say a word,
I just have weed wherever.

3534
02:46:14,151 --> 02:46:14,984
I just have weed in Arizona.
Some of denver I would have to smoke 

3535
02:46:21,891 --> 02:46:22,790
weed.
Yeah.

3536
02:46:23,240 --> 02:46:24,500
And then I have two more and I go to 
bed.

3537
02:46:25,310 --> 02:46:26,950
Okay.
So forth.

3538
02:46:26,951 --> 02:46:30,560
Still a lot.
So I'm partying tonight by the way,

3539
02:46:30,561 --> 02:46:31,350
stan.
Hope.

3540
02:46:31,350 --> 02:46:32,760
If I mean I'll,
I'll,

3541
02:46:33,500 --> 02:46:34,333
I'm.
Here's the.

3542
02:46:34,420 --> 02:46:38,120
To be as honest comes.
Do you hope know is under the bus.

3543
02:46:38,300 --> 02:46:41,510
I want to know.
I'm super honest with you guys.

3544
02:46:41,511 --> 02:46:44,240
I'm being honest,
but when talking to stan hope I do this.

3545
02:46:44,780 --> 02:46:49,780
Did we do this on a podcast and a super 
honest about a rock wall intake?

3546
02:46:51,050 --> 02:46:53,610
I wouldn't say no.
I don't remember.

3547
02:46:54,750 --> 02:46:58,190
And I forgot immediately.
Stand up.

3548
02:46:58,191 --> 02:46:58,761
Well,
I'll tell you what,

3549
02:46:58,761 --> 02:47:02,410
one of the most beautiful things that 
standing up and I said is people go,

3550
02:47:02,411 --> 02:47:04,850
uh oh yeah.
I quit drinking because I like getting a

3551
02:47:04,851 --> 02:47:05,684
good night's sleep.

3552
02:47:05,810 --> 02:47:08,660
And I was told stan hope.
He's like that ridiculous.

3553
02:47:08,661 --> 02:47:09,494
I go,
yeah,

3554
02:47:09,760 --> 02:47:10,980
I'm going to quit drinking,
striking,

3555
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:16,000
use chopsticks in the morning,
doing no jet eating sushi sashimi in the

3556
02:47:16,521 --> 02:47:17,900
morning.
Like at like 11:00

3557
02:47:17,900 --> 02:47:20,360
AM after you've had partied hard.
It's not doable.

3558
02:47:21,460 --> 02:47:23,120
Yeah,
it's a little bit of a struggle,

3559
02:47:23,600 --> 02:47:28,600
but I'd definitely say it would be 
doable on your hands trying to keep up,

3560
02:47:29,440 --> 02:47:31,130
shake chopsticks,
shakes,

3561
02:47:31,470 --> 02:47:32,303
shakes.
No question.

3562
02:47:32,340 --> 02:47:36,130
You have a problem,
but we're going to be.

3563
02:47:37,590 --> 02:47:40,570
That's a true statement.
Is that a true statement?

3564
02:47:40,870 --> 02:47:42,320
Yeah,
I legit right now.

3565
02:47:42,321 --> 02:47:43,430
Right now.
Uh,

3566
02:47:43,490 --> 02:47:45,530
I'm,
we've talked about this a bunch,

3567
02:47:45,531 --> 02:47:47,330
but like I'm pushing myself way too 
hard,

3568
02:47:47,580 --> 02:47:47,930
the

3569
02:47:47,930 --> 02:47:49,230
capability to do.
Okay.

3570
02:47:49,231 --> 02:47:50,064
THis is what I think we should do.
What I think we should do in all 

3571
02:47:52,591 --> 02:47:53,630
earnestness.
It's like we,

3572
02:47:53,650 --> 02:47:55,590
we haven't even,
we're in september.

3573
02:47:55,591 --> 02:47:56,081
What?
Well,

3574
02:47:56,081 --> 02:47:58,400
what is September 4th.
Okay.

3575
02:47:59,220 --> 02:48:00,053
Why don't we give ourselves a week and 
we could do this again and sit down and 

3576
02:48:06,330 --> 02:48:07,163
see what you think about whether or not 
you could wean yourself off slowly or 

3577
02:48:11,281 --> 02:48:13,590
whether you even want to do it.
I do.

3578
02:48:13,591 --> 02:48:17,340
I do.
This is what I really want you.

3579
02:48:17,341 --> 02:48:18,174
I really want you to think about it 
because I think that I think you could 

3580
02:48:20,760 --> 02:48:23,790
either decide to not just live your life
the way you live in,

3581
02:48:23,791 --> 02:48:27,300
which is obviously very successful.
People love to see you party with them.

3582
02:48:27,440 --> 02:48:28,273
They love you.
I mean,

3583
02:48:28,380 --> 02:48:30,650
it's a big part of the fund that you're 
in,

3584
02:48:30,750 --> 02:48:32,700
you're having,
you're enjoying with your standup comedy

3585
02:48:32,701 --> 02:48:35,850
career,
but legitimately like as friends,

3586
02:48:36,150 --> 02:48:38,610
when you see someone who's taken in that
much alcohol,

3587
02:48:38,611 --> 02:48:40,620
you start getting nervous and you start 
getting like,

3588
02:48:40,621 --> 02:48:43,470
okay,
how long can you do that?

3589
02:48:43,680 --> 02:48:44,340
Like,
um,

3590
02:48:44,340 --> 02:48:45,780
that's,
that's tricky.

3591
02:48:45,781 --> 02:48:48,060
That's super dangerous.
It's not dangerous.

3592
02:48:48,390 --> 02:48:51,990
It really isn't that.
It's dangerous to have 12 drinks a day.

3593
02:48:52,590 --> 02:48:55,340
Hold on man.
This is why.

3594
02:48:55,350 --> 02:48:56,580
Oh no,
no,

3595
02:48:56,581 --> 02:48:56,971
no,
no,

3596
02:48:56,971 --> 02:48:57,331
no,
no.

3597
02:48:57,331 --> 02:48:58,690
I'm taking the financing.
I'm sorry.

3598
02:48:58,880 --> 02:49:00,180
No,
I'm not taking the fun out of it,

3599
02:49:00,181 --> 02:49:02,580
but I'm saying that if you do that all 
the time to do an intervention,

3600
02:49:02,581 --> 02:49:03,414
this was turning into the sad shit.
I'm just being honest and being honest 

3601
02:49:06,241 --> 02:49:08,250
about that.
Number one thing that's

3602
02:49:08,310 --> 02:49:12,390
you have to admit is a fair thing is 
like,

3603
02:49:12,420 --> 02:49:14,970
you do see that,
like let's say if you were examining,

3604
02:49:15,570 --> 02:49:17,940
let's say your last week,
you realize it,

3605
02:49:18,150 --> 02:49:23,150
that that pace could not continue for 
every 100 percent didn't with you.

3606
02:49:24,690 --> 02:49:29,690
No one can keep up with you.
I took two naps close to keeping up with

3607
02:49:32,551 --> 02:49:33,840
You.
We talk about it all the time,

3608
02:49:33,841 --> 02:49:34,674
lIke how the fuck does he do it?
like this is the opposite of what I 

3609
02:49:37,531 --> 02:49:38,500
wanted out of this.
Yeah.

3610
02:49:38,501 --> 02:49:42,210
I think it just turns into like a.
People go,

3611
02:49:42,211 --> 02:49:43,840
oh shit,
he's really got a problem,

3612
02:49:44,100 --> 02:49:47,220
but that's what it's turning into this.
Don't listen to me joe.

3613
02:49:47,221 --> 02:49:48,660
I can't.
You're overreacting.

3614
02:49:48,661 --> 02:49:49,494
What I'm saying is you could live your 
life the way you're living at right now 

3615
02:49:52,141 --> 02:49:52,974
and you're obviously enjoying yourself 
or I don't know if you think you have a 

3616
02:49:55,621 --> 02:49:56,454
problem,
if you feel like you have a problem and 

3617
02:49:57,661 --> 02:49:59,820
I don't want to make any judgment 
whatsoever,

3618
02:50:00,030 --> 02:50:00,863
I literally want you to act the way you 
feel because you can hunter s thompson 

3619
02:50:05,561 --> 02:50:06,394
this thing right into the grave and a 
lot of people have done it and they 

3620
02:50:08,581 --> 02:50:09,414
probably had a better life than people 
that have lived sober and regretful and 

3621
02:50:13,121 --> 02:50:13,954
and deepen melancholy states of mind 
until you know their fucking body shuts 

3622
02:50:19,411 --> 02:50:19,960
down.

3623
02:50:19,960 --> 02:50:20,793
I don't know what's better.
I don't know if a a short life filled 

3624
02:50:22,891 --> 02:50:23,724
with partying is better than a long life
of meditating and we're in an orange 

3625
02:50:26,521 --> 02:50:28,230
robe.
I mean there's a real good argument that

3626
02:50:28,231 --> 02:50:31,290
it's not because a real good argument 
that the party life is a better life,

3627
02:50:31,650 --> 02:50:35,670
but what I think about any type of 
situation like this,

3628
02:50:35,700 --> 02:50:39,060
I don't want to change the way you 
think.

3629
02:50:39,660 --> 02:50:41,550
I want you to Do whatever the fuck you 
want to do.

3630
02:50:41,940 --> 02:50:44,100
That's why I said that already in the 
car.

3631
02:50:44,101 --> 02:50:45,420
I was like,
I can't do 90 days.

3632
02:50:47,080 --> 02:50:48,810
It's not the Way my brain operates 
because.

3633
02:50:49,760 --> 02:50:52,500
But I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but this is really important.

3634
02:50:52,501 --> 02:50:53,334
Do you think that it's possible that 
once you got into it and once you were 

3635
02:50:56,101 --> 02:51:00,450
in 20 days deep and you realize like you
can feel better every day and keep going

3636
02:51:00,451 --> 02:51:01,320
at that point,
right?

3637
02:51:01,500 --> 02:51:06,080
You could like I think part bert is 
going to get out of the first 10 to fit.

3638
02:51:06,090 --> 02:51:07,900
I'm not a fucking doctor.
I don't know what,

3639
02:51:08,080 --> 02:51:10,380
what it's like when people have 
withdrawal from alcohol,

3640
02:51:10,381 --> 02:51:12,510
but you are 100 percent right?
The hardest part,

3641
02:51:12,511 --> 02:51:13,344
10 days or so.
It was probably sunday morning and the 

3642
02:51:14,731 --> 02:51:16,330
dc airport.
Yeah.

3643
02:51:16,350 --> 02:51:18,060
That'll be the hardest part.
And by the way,

3644
02:51:18,061 --> 02:51:19,860
by the way,
I've,

3645
02:51:19,920 --> 02:51:20,753
I've definitely done this like I've 
definitely not drank for fucking five 

3646
02:51:24,091 --> 02:51:24,924
days.
Like it's totally doable and I'm not 

3647
02:51:26,491 --> 02:51:27,960
going to die.
That's the other thing that.

3648
02:51:28,280 --> 02:51:29,113
Well we were a little worried about you.
You have to admit that the concern for 

3649
02:51:32,761 --> 02:51:33,940
that,
like it's.

3650
02:51:34,140 --> 02:51:36,810
I don't think you're gonna die but,
but having the thought like,

3651
02:51:36,930 --> 02:51:37,763
hey,
my friend who drinks like 80 drinks a 

3652
02:51:38,641 --> 02:51:39,870
day,
he's going to stop drinking.

3653
02:51:40,710 --> 02:51:42,030
You know,
you have to have as a friend.

3654
02:51:42,031 --> 02:51:43,290
You go,
is that a safe?

3655
02:51:43,291 --> 02:51:43,591
No,
no,

3656
02:51:43,591 --> 02:51:44,400
no,
I don't.

3657
02:51:44,400 --> 02:51:45,750
I honestly,
I don't think you got the shAkes.

3658
02:51:45,751 --> 02:51:46,584
I think he'll just drink again because 
there was no way you can do fucking 30 

3659
02:51:48,700 --> 02:51:49,533
days.
I think that if he can get past a 

3660
02:51:52,891 --> 02:51:56,970
certain number of hours,
the longer you can get past this,

3661
02:51:57,030 --> 02:51:59,940
there's like six.
It's like,

3662
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:01,980
listen man,
this is really what it's like.

3663
02:52:02,130 --> 02:52:02,963
It's like gravity.
It's like when you're closer to the 

3664
02:52:04,900 --> 02:52:06,120
planet earth is there's

3665
02:52:06,130 --> 02:52:09,310
a lot more gravity and you got to get 
further and further and further and once

3666
02:52:09,311 --> 02:52:10,840
you do,
you can see what you're saying.

3667
02:52:10,841 --> 02:52:15,841
I see what the gravity of alcoholism 
clearly wrapped up in it.

3668
02:52:16,550 --> 02:52:17,290
It's.
I wouldn't,

3669
02:52:17,290 --> 02:52:19,300
I wouldn't say alcoholism because I 
don't,

3670
02:52:19,710 --> 02:52:21,780
but the only because when you really 
call it,

3671
02:52:22,870 --> 02:52:23,703
call it you to get away from babu and 
figure out a way to not need alcohol 

3672
02:52:29,201 --> 02:52:31,930
every day.
I think you can do this.

3673
02:52:32,020 --> 02:52:35,200
I think you can do it,
but I think it's a good challenge.

3674
02:52:35,201 --> 02:52:36,930
We we're down to 60 days,
30 days,

3675
02:52:37,010 --> 02:52:38,890
30 days,
31 days.

3676
02:52:39,150 --> 02:52:41,740
Thirty one days or bust.
Here's the deal.

3677
02:52:41,741 --> 02:52:43,960
Just keep it rocking in the free world.
And burt.

3678
02:52:44,400 --> 02:52:46,150
Okay.
If you can do october,

3679
02:52:46,151 --> 02:52:48,690
we're going to do it sober.
Sober sober.

3680
02:52:48,700 --> 02:52:49,750
October.
November.

3681
02:52:50,280 --> 02:52:53,020
So bourbon.
So are you participating?

3682
02:52:53,500 --> 02:52:54,930
Are you doing it?
He won't do it.

3683
02:52:54,970 --> 02:52:56,920
I don't have a problem.
I enjoy drinking.

3684
02:52:57,400 --> 02:52:59,420
Alcoholic set.
Go ahead and keep saying it weird.

3685
02:52:59,830 --> 02:53:01,240
Getting drunk.
Is that how we make it?

3686
02:53:01,490 --> 02:53:03,040
Is that how you make it like a,
you know,

3687
02:53:03,250 --> 02:53:05,470
or is it.
It'll be enjoyable for me,

3688
02:53:07,850 --> 02:53:09,160
but listen,
I'll do it.

3689
02:53:09,280 --> 02:53:12,130
It's super easy that I could easily do.
Or do you feel.

3690
02:53:12,131 --> 02:53:12,964
Do you feel like we're picking on you?
Because that's what I really wanted to 

3691
02:53:14,201 --> 02:53:16,810
make sure we avoided.
It got serious for a second.

3692
02:53:16,970 --> 02:53:17,803
They got serious for a second.
Most the strongest amount of mocking of 

3693
02:53:20,311 --> 02:53:22,510
you possible without hurting your 
feelings.

3694
02:53:22,511 --> 02:53:23,950
That's what we're going for.
First of all,

3695
02:53:24,400 --> 02:53:27,430
here's a look.
Fuck.

3696
02:53:28,380 --> 02:53:31,090
Jimmy can get more ice.
Everybody loves you.

3697
02:53:31,100 --> 02:53:33,030
So I understand that.
I understand that,

3698
02:53:33,120 --> 02:53:36,340
but we both know shoulder to cry on.
I can put my tee shirt on.

3699
02:53:37,340 --> 02:53:38,173
We both know that when we did this 
fashion shit yet it got out of control 

3700
02:53:40,811 --> 02:53:44,020
like this out of control doors.

3701
02:53:44,480 --> 02:53:45,131
Intellectual like,
hey,

3702
02:53:45,131 --> 02:53:45,821
you know,
I like you,

3703
02:53:45,821 --> 02:53:46,480
right?
Yeah,

3704
02:53:46,480 --> 02:53:46,931
yeah,
yeah,

3705
02:53:46,931 --> 02:53:48,220
yeah.
That's what joe just said.

3706
02:53:49,020 --> 02:53:50,890
I need.
I've had.

3707
02:53:50,891 --> 02:53:51,724
I've had a real moments with every 
single one of you and I know you're my 

3708
02:53:55,121 --> 02:53:56,290
friends.
I know that you're not.

3709
02:53:56,291 --> 02:53:58,690
You don't talk behind my back.
All this shit that bad friends do.

3710
02:53:58,691 --> 02:54:03,230
I know that shut up,
but like there is a part of me that goes

3711
02:54:03,250 --> 02:54:05,530
to do something stupid.
We keep our mouth shut.

3712
02:54:06,160 --> 02:54:11,160
I have talked about know what were 
talking about.

3713
02:54:15,810 --> 02:54:17,610
Oh man.
If,

3714
02:54:17,630 --> 02:54:19,810
if it gets to the point where you can't 
mock each other,

3715
02:54:19,811 --> 02:54:21,460
I just don't want to be here.
Yeah,

3716
02:54:21,490 --> 02:54:23,110
yeah.
It does.

3717
02:54:23,140 --> 02:54:27,190
It does sometimes and you're like,
hey,

3718
02:54:27,191 --> 02:54:28,360
everyone likes me.
Right guys,

3719
02:54:30,100 --> 02:54:31,120
love you.
We love you,

3720
02:54:31,150 --> 02:54:34,330
but I,
I hear you're the best.

3721
02:54:42,880 --> 02:54:44,800
If you stop drinking,
you could lose 15,

3722
02:54:44,801 --> 02:54:49,801
20 more years.
It's going to be first month.

3723
02:54:50,380 --> 02:54:52,750
Actually.
It will ruin your brand.

3724
02:54:53,090 --> 02:54:56,020
Do marathons.
He will win marathons.

3725
02:54:56,510 --> 02:54:57,343
He will weigh a hundred and 48 pounds.
You will have your shirt off stage and 

3726
02:55:02,021 --> 02:55:05,330
how the shippers from being so fucking 
cold and then it's going to be weird.

3727
02:55:05,450 --> 02:55:07,940
They're not going to be happy.
We take your shirt off and you got a six

3728
02:55:07,941 --> 02:55:08,750
pack.
No,

3729
02:55:08,750 --> 02:55:10,880
he shredded.
You got lattes and do this.

3730
02:55:10,910 --> 02:55:11,743
Oh,
you got to stretch my back with that 

3731
02:55:16,240 --> 02:55:19,250
side.
So my dad lives in Florida,

3732
02:55:19,251 --> 02:55:24,251
which was 40 pounds.
This sounds like though it's just a bird

3733
02:55:25,430 --> 02:55:26,440
challenge.
Is that what I'm doing?

3734
02:55:26,500 --> 02:55:28,640
We should all get in on something.
What I.

3735
02:55:28,850 --> 02:55:31,760
That's one of the reasons why I was 
saying it's already 3:30.

3736
02:55:31,820 --> 02:55:36,600
Maybe we should like,
we have to happen.

3737
02:55:36,790 --> 02:55:37,960
It will happen.
They'll challenge.

3738
02:55:37,970 --> 02:55:41,250
You can do this and then you have to 
fucking fake this in shape.

3739
02:55:41,251 --> 02:55:42,084
Challenge against us.
How about I get to pick the next 

3740
02:55:46,071 --> 02:55:47,660
challenge?
You,

3741
02:55:47,720 --> 02:55:49,410
but you're not going to America.

3742
02:55:52,100 --> 02:55:54,900
It was so gross way you said it,
dude.

3743
02:55:54,920 --> 02:55:58,050
I felt my bucket and he said it like 
garth brooks and business,

3744
02:55:58,070 --> 02:56:03,070
social media friends and low.
Is it?

3745
02:56:08,180 --> 02:56:12,800
Is it out of?
Is it out of a brand?

3746
02:56:13,250 --> 02:56:14,950
No,
you can get clean for me.

3747
02:56:14,980 --> 02:56:19,040
This is for me to get like napalm,
like get people to help me back.

3748
02:56:19,041 --> 02:56:20,600
Me and during this challenge or they'll 
fill up.

3749
02:56:20,601 --> 02:56:22,980
That'll make you feel better or 
something.

3750
02:56:23,320 --> 02:56:24,430
No kidding.
Like standard.

3751
02:56:24,510 --> 02:56:26,930
Like oh,
okay.

3752
02:56:26,990 --> 02:56:29,570
And standup's like amen.
If you're in I'll do it.

3753
02:56:30,030 --> 02:56:31,610
Okay.
That'd be great for everybody.

3754
02:56:32,520 --> 02:56:34,570
Stan.
Hope in it too and okay.

3755
02:56:35,330 --> 02:56:37,790
Do you want to get some balls?
Wants to try to get ron wyden.

3756
02:56:37,791 --> 02:56:38,780
He'll spit in your face.

3757
02:56:43,730 --> 02:56:47,460
What the fuck did you just say?
Yeah,

3758
02:56:48,110 --> 02:56:49,820
I'm from Texas.
They just run away from.

3759
02:56:49,880 --> 02:56:52,530
You're sober sober october,
november.

3760
02:56:52,560 --> 02:56:53,393
Also soapbox our sober october.
It's october and then whoever can join 

3761
02:56:57,651 --> 02:57:00,560
in can join in if they want to like.
It'd be cool to run into guys like,

3762
02:57:00,561 --> 02:57:03,560
what do you think your percentages are?
Fail or succeed?

3763
02:57:03,630 --> 02:57:04,463
Hundred percent.
Of course it's going to say that he can 

3764
02:57:07,761 --> 02:57:10,290
run a marathon.
That's a ridiculous number.

3765
02:57:12,170 --> 02:57:13,850
What's the number?
One hundred percent is ridiculous.

3766
02:57:13,851 --> 02:57:16,580
There's no way.
Almost nothing is that are your favorite

3767
02:57:16,581 --> 02:57:19,310
principal in highschool dies and he says
in his will,

3768
02:57:19,311 --> 02:57:21,080
I want you to drink one more drink for 
me.

3769
02:57:22,940 --> 02:57:24,950
Let me ask you a question.
What is the.

3770
02:57:25,130 --> 02:57:27,680
What are the odds that you can run one 
mile?

3771
02:57:28,190 --> 02:57:29,210
I can run a mile.
Okay.

3772
02:57:32,220 --> 02:57:33,290
what are the.
What is that?

3773
02:57:33,291 --> 02:57:35,230
Ninety eight percent?
That's a good number.

3774
02:57:35,800 --> 02:57:37,370
That's a pretty reasonable number.
one mile.

3775
02:57:37,371 --> 02:57:38,204
It's so easy.
Ninety eight disasters out of the 

3776
02:57:41,001 --> 02:57:45,470
equation.
That's why 98 percent loss of family.

3777
02:57:46,460 --> 02:57:49,240
My dad passed away.
I'm going to drink.

3778
02:57:49,780 --> 02:57:51,440
I'm just talking about injuries one 
mile,

3779
02:57:51,810 --> 02:57:56,810
one mile for most you can twist 20 steps
in.

3780
02:57:59,050 --> 02:58:02,400
That's a strong number number.
So

3781
02:58:02,520 --> 02:58:03,990
what what happened?
I can do it.

3782
02:58:03,991 --> 02:58:06,540
Ninety eight percent.
That's a good number.

3783
02:58:07,190 --> 02:58:10,620
A good number for like running flat.
Now when you run in hills like ari that,

3784
02:58:10,660 --> 02:58:12,290
that,
that trail that you and I went down,

3785
02:58:12,291 --> 02:58:15,540
but we did that podcast together.
That's not a 98 percent.

3786
02:58:15,541 --> 02:58:16,374
I think about that sometimes.
Like if I broke my ankle or something 

3787
02:58:18,391 --> 02:58:21,570
down on how do I get out of that?
That's an option.

3788
02:58:21,600 --> 02:58:23,260
There's no phone service down though.
Yeah,

3789
02:58:23,350 --> 02:58:26,410
I'm going to crawl out of there so I 
think about it,

3790
02:58:26,910 --> 02:58:29,490
but I think I can crawl out of there 
pretty easy for broken ankle.

3791
02:58:29,550 --> 02:58:31,320
I think you get it to change your 
percentage again.

3792
02:58:31,560 --> 02:58:33,030
I think crawl out of there would be 
pretty hard,

3793
02:58:33,200 --> 02:58:35,580
but I'm getting now.
Okay.

3794
02:58:35,640 --> 02:58:37,260
What's your percentage?
They're legit percentage.

3795
02:58:37,290 --> 02:58:40,500
You could do it sober for october.
October.

3796
02:58:40,790 --> 02:58:42,930
What percentage?
Really think about it.

3797
02:58:43,090 --> 02:58:46,980
Okay,
I got it.

3798
02:58:47,550 --> 02:58:48,530
What's going on here?
Bert?

3799
02:58:48,710 --> 02:58:53,710
$50 to flip the coin decision away.
By the way,

3800
02:58:54,241 --> 02:58:56,190
I think you're wrong,
but I think it's way more realistic than

3801
02:58:56,191 --> 02:58:58,320
any of the other two numbers you've 
given about.

3802
02:58:58,321 --> 02:59:01,590
What about kundalini yoga?
You ever hear kundalini yoga?

3803
02:59:01,650 --> 02:59:04,980
Kundalini yogi supposedly could do a 
psychedelic experience with.

3804
02:59:05,440 --> 02:59:05,890
No.
No,

3805
02:59:05,890 --> 02:59:06,723
no.
If I'm sure he told her because if I 

3806
02:59:09,030 --> 02:59:12,420
don't know what I'm saying,
doing kundalini yoga,

3807
02:59:12,980 --> 02:59:15,570
it gives you a true.
Okay.

3808
02:59:15,571 --> 02:59:17,430
I'll try it.
And you know danny,

3809
02:59:17,610 --> 02:59:19,740
one of eddie is black belts.
Yeah.

3810
02:59:19,741 --> 02:59:21,630
Pro publica.
Specify the greeks.

3811
02:59:21,900 --> 02:59:23,570
Great motherfucker.
But he.

3812
02:59:23,571 --> 02:59:25,120
He does it all the time.
Really?

3813
02:59:25,140 --> 02:59:25,560
Yeah.
Yeah.

3814
02:59:25,560 --> 02:59:26,393
He's like legit,
like he's like a yogi and he says that 

3815
02:59:29,710 --> 02:59:33,270
kundalini gives you a complete total 
psychedelic state.

3816
02:59:33,360 --> 02:59:34,530
I've never tried it.
Wow.

3817
02:59:34,560 --> 02:59:37,380
We could all try it together.
That will count as one of the holidays.

3818
02:59:38,010 --> 02:59:40,620
What if we do this?
What if we get someone to.

3819
02:59:41,040 --> 02:59:41,873
You're going to stick around here.
Are you going to just sit around you on 

3820
02:59:46,140 --> 02:59:48,960
where you go?
You went to fucking asia for a month.

3821
02:59:49,110 --> 02:59:49,943
Their cell phone.
You can't hang around with here for 

3822
02:59:51,451 --> 02:59:53,970
sober friend sober and do kundalini 
yoga.

3823
02:59:54,050 --> 02:59:57,500
We'll see if we can get high.
Let's see if we can do.

3824
02:59:57,510 --> 02:59:59,430
I'll do it.
Let's see if we can meet the aliens.

3825
03:00:00,160 --> 03:00:03,000
Okay,
so what I have heard from people that do

3826
03:00:03,001 --> 03:00:05,100
it,
if you do it long enough and correctly,

3827
03:00:05,101 --> 03:00:05,934
you can have intense,
full blown hallucinogenic psychedelic 

3828
03:00:09,361 --> 03:00:14,130
experiences that rival mushrooms and 
wait long enough.

3829
03:00:14,131 --> 03:00:16,740
You mean enough times in a row or long 
enough in one time?

3830
03:00:16,770 --> 03:00:18,070
That's a good question.
I.

3831
03:00:18,160 --> 03:00:21,540
I have zero experience and this is 
purely anecdotal.

3832
03:00:21,600 --> 03:00:24,030
All finished.
Too many people that are trust that have

3833
03:00:24,040 --> 03:00:26,880
done this and had that have had 
psychedelic experience.

3834
03:00:26,900 --> 03:00:30,120
Are we all gonna do soBer and yoga or is
it.

3835
03:00:30,510 --> 03:00:33,240
I'm down.
I'm down hot yoga.

3836
03:00:33,780 --> 03:00:34,291
Come on,
hold on.

3837
03:00:34,291 --> 03:00:35,610
Hold on.
One sober.

3838
03:00:35,611 --> 03:00:40,611
We're talking.
We'd use.

3839
03:00:42,880 --> 03:00:45,330
I can get into that place.
I can get it to that.

3840
03:00:45,331 --> 03:00:46,240
No,
we'd place for them.

3841
03:00:46,241 --> 03:00:47,620
I don't know.
Do you want to be there?

3842
03:00:47,621 --> 03:00:48,454
I.
I'm working.

3843
03:00:49,050 --> 03:00:50,160
It's weird.
I can do that.

3844
03:00:50,370 --> 03:00:51,960
I could do it.
I don't mind it on the cruise.

3845
03:00:51,961 --> 03:00:52,540
I could do.
No,

3846
03:00:52,540 --> 03:00:55,570
we'd already.
October.

3847
03:00:55,920 --> 03:01:00,010
Intense cardio.
Intense cardio produces those same

3848
03:01:00,010 --> 03:01:02,230
sorts of weird euphoric feelings.
It's like,

3849
03:01:02,410 --> 03:01:03,970
and you brought up the way this started 
and you're fat,

3850
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:05,200
you burn it off a little bit.
Yeah.

3851
03:01:05,260 --> 03:01:06,093
A little bit of that.
When extends cardio does is gives you 

3852
03:01:07,961 --> 03:01:10,350
that after we'd feeling,
you know,

3853
03:01:10,360 --> 03:01:11,193
the after we'd feel them.
When you're super high and the end with 

3854
03:01:12,541 --> 03:01:13,930
the tail end of it,
you just feel great.

3855
03:01:13,990 --> 03:01:16,190
You want to just put weed in the bucket 
and we'll have.

3856
03:01:16,200 --> 03:01:19,340
We'll do we just in case.
Okay.

3857
03:01:19,360 --> 03:01:20,193
We should think about it.
We should definitely not do anything 

3858
03:01:21,041 --> 03:01:21,874
rash.
We should realize that he doesn't love 

3859
03:01:23,341 --> 03:01:24,174
us as much as he loves going to Vietnam 
and hanging out with people he doesn't 

3860
03:01:26,951 --> 03:01:28,380
even know.
15 days of yoga aren't.

3861
03:01:28,390 --> 03:01:29,850
You?
Don't have any scheduled.

3862
03:01:29,910 --> 03:01:33,220
Were you gone 15 days of yoga,
31 dayS sober.

3863
03:01:33,520 --> 03:01:35,440
all of october.
October.

3864
03:01:35,500 --> 03:01:36,280
What are you going to do?

3865
03:01:36,280 --> 03:01:37,180
Not.
What else are you going to do?

3866
03:01:37,330 --> 03:01:42,330
I couldn't go to Thailand to make my own
rice.

3867
03:01:43,200 --> 03:01:44,033
I live off a backpack.
Sleep would weirdos text them the fuck 

3868
03:01:47,450 --> 03:01:48,570
shit.
No,

3869
03:01:48,580 --> 03:01:49,413
no.
That's the fam who he texts him as 

3870
03:01:51,140 --> 03:01:51,973
issues.
Problems should head over man riders on 

3871
03:01:55,231 --> 03:01:56,021
the storm.
Yes,

3872
03:01:56,021 --> 03:01:57,810
3:33.
This means we're about.

3873
03:01:58,320 --> 03:02:02,010
No,
we're fun.

3874
03:02:02,700 --> 03:02:05,670
We got to keep going.
something sober far.

3875
03:02:06,550 --> 03:02:07,810
I'm just trying to think what this 
means.

3876
03:02:08,050 --> 03:02:09,670
This means no,
no,

3877
03:02:09,760 --> 03:02:11,140
we'd.
Okay.

3878
03:02:11,170 --> 03:02:12,880
On one hand I don't want to do the 
knotweed.

3879
03:02:13,150 --> 03:02:16,240
On the other hand,
I think if he does sober but also smokes

3880
03:02:16,241 --> 03:02:17,074
weed,
it's just gonna be a stop gap to get 

3881
03:02:17,801 --> 03:02:19,420
them right back to drinking heavily 
again.

3882
03:02:20,230 --> 03:02:23,770
It's interesting you say it again,
that if you're allowed to smoke weed,

3883
03:02:24,080 --> 03:02:28,010
you're smoking into drinking more.
As soon as I'm like,

3884
03:02:28,240 --> 03:02:29,140
oh,
there's no way around,

3885
03:02:29,141 --> 03:02:30,250
but I can get drunk tonight.

3886
03:02:30,280 --> 03:02:31,420
Okay,
that'll laSt me till tomorrow.

3887
03:02:32,680 --> 03:02:35,290
I'll tell you that in all honesty,
once again,

3888
03:02:35,490 --> 03:02:36,060
uh,
I have,

3889
03:02:36,060 --> 03:02:36,893
uh,
I have a problem with tee total 

3890
03:02:38,200 --> 03:02:39,070
learning.
So if I,

3891
03:02:39,150 --> 03:02:39,983
if I don't drink,
I actually won't do anything because I 

3892
03:02:41,771 --> 03:02:44,740
get a little obsessive compulsive.
But are you permitting?

3893
03:02:44,741 --> 03:02:48,700
What do you mean by what do you mean by 
that time that have no teetotaling means

3894
03:02:48,701 --> 03:02:51,580
I don't do anything like I become really
strict about.

3895
03:02:51,581 --> 03:02:55,750
It also means it happens if I want a 
little bit.

3896
03:02:55,751 --> 03:02:57,670
If I smoke weed,
I'll pRobably end up wanting a beer.

3897
03:02:57,760 --> 03:02:58,870
Well,
let's let him express himself.

3898
03:02:58,871 --> 03:02:59,381
Well,
what do you mean?

3899
03:02:59,381 --> 03:03:00,214
Like you have a problem with tito,
tito and his obsessive compulsive 

3900
03:03:03,250 --> 03:03:07,000
compulsiveness.
I get like a seven Days right on drink.

3901
03:03:07,001 --> 03:03:08,110
And I go,
fuck dude,

3902
03:03:08,200 --> 03:03:09,033
I don't want to drink at all.
You given it even means you Have no 

3903
03:03:11,591 --> 03:03:12,020
problem with.

3904
03:03:12,020 --> 03:03:12,853
You could just go right on solidly.
Not no problem because the problem that 

3905
03:03:15,281 --> 03:03:17,110
comes up the first day of drinking 
again,

3906
03:03:17,140 --> 03:03:19,990
I get obSessive about it and I can't 
have a drink because I go,

3907
03:03:20,140 --> 03:03:21,040
man,
you do it so good.

3908
03:03:21,041 --> 03:03:22,750
Don't fucking drink.
It's almost a way.

3909
03:03:22,751 --> 03:03:23,980
You know.
So like if I,

3910
03:03:24,120 --> 03:03:26,230
I just won't smoke weed.
That's just real.

3911
03:03:26,470 --> 03:03:29,500
But I don't care if you guys do.
You should smoke weed and do yoga.

3912
03:03:30,160 --> 03:03:31,480
There you go.
That's what you should do.

3913
03:03:31,990 --> 03:03:32,823
Here you go.
But you'll say he'll smoke weed and 

3914
03:03:34,760 --> 03:03:35,593
drink drinking.
Because if I see you guys at the store 

3915
03:03:38,350 --> 03:03:39,880
and you guys have joined,
I'd want to smoke.

3916
03:03:39,940 --> 03:03:43,300
Should get together and do what the 
young kids would say.

3917
03:03:43,470 --> 03:03:44,303
Hell,
a bong rips and then go take some 

3918
03:03:45,971 --> 03:03:48,590
fucking yoga class.
I do that helmet.

3919
03:03:49,120 --> 03:03:50,750
Let's do it.
We should do it.

3920
03:03:50,770 --> 03:03:53,440
We get vice to get in on this.
I do that in a heartbeat,

3921
03:03:53,470 --> 03:03:56,960
but the yoga classes in 30 days,
so do it.

3922
03:03:57,020 --> 03:03:57,853
I'll do it

3923
03:03:58,400 --> 03:03:59,061
sober,
sober,

3924
03:03:59,061 --> 03:04:01,600
sober.
Doing yoga classes in 15 minutes and you

3925
03:04:01,630 --> 03:04:03,480
kick on the road,
you can get high.

3926
03:04:03,500 --> 03:04:05,900
You got to do the roads on the road.
Yeah.

3927
03:04:05,901 --> 03:04:07,640
Fifteen,
15 hot yoga classes.

3928
03:04:07,641 --> 03:04:08,474
Yeah,
but you can get high as you want chemo 

3929
03:04:10,101 --> 03:04:11,600
sobbing and they'll follow you to the 
road.

3930
03:04:11,630 --> 03:04:14,270
Whoever device or whoever does it or 
whatever.

3931
03:04:14,271 --> 03:04:19,271
Ankle bracelets device.
That'll hold me accountable.

3932
03:04:19,980 --> 03:04:22,730
We would move into a weird area if we 
don't trust each other.

3933
03:04:23,090 --> 03:04:25,520
I tried this.
I agree with you,

3934
03:04:25,521 --> 03:04:28,010
but I don't trust part.
Are you serious?

3935
03:04:28,530 --> 03:04:30,080
No way.
There's no way.

3936
03:04:30,081 --> 03:04:31,580
It'd be too crazy to say.
Just trust me.

3937
03:04:33,260 --> 03:04:37,780
You know him saying he's in great shape 
and he can run a marathon.

3938
03:04:37,790 --> 03:04:38,623
Easy.
I've held that need to be 100 percent 

3939
03:04:41,001 --> 03:04:46,001
unbiased and complete ideas when the 
fucking keep that body cams on.

3940
03:04:48,140 --> 03:04:50,430
I had a glass of red wine with dinner.
What's the big deal?

3941
03:04:50,930 --> 03:04:52,050
Okay,
so scram.

3942
03:04:54,950 --> 03:04:55,783
Scram.
Cam.

3943
03:04:55,960 --> 03:04:56,793
Yeah.
I don't.

3944
03:04:56,840 --> 03:05:01,840
I don't want them to where it's cramped 
with a wonderful opportunity for bart to

3945
03:05:02,121 --> 03:05:04,760
come clean.
Just just come clean with us.

3946
03:05:05,180 --> 03:05:10,180
You don't need skype cameRa.
You're not coming clean.

3947
03:05:10,311 --> 03:05:11,630
But that like,
you don't like that.

3948
03:05:11,660 --> 03:05:14,240
you're just,
there's not even a possibility.

3949
03:05:14,241 --> 03:05:15,074
I don't think there's a possibility that
you would lie to you unless you know 

3950
03:05:19,980 --> 03:05:22,460
this is a binary thing.
This is the one in zero thing.

3951
03:05:22,461 --> 03:05:24,590
This isn't like what brett's talking 
about before.

3952
03:05:24,591 --> 03:05:25,424
Sort of like fun and exaggerations,
but when you're talking to like one or 

3953
03:05:30,021 --> 03:05:32,030
zero,
did you yes or no drink?

3954
03:05:32,270 --> 03:05:33,140
Yeah.
I trust you.

3955
03:05:33,590 --> 03:05:34,423
If I drank,
I just start drinking again and let you 

3956
03:05:35,361 --> 03:05:37,760
guys knoW.
I don't mind losing the next steps.

3957
03:05:37,780 --> 03:05:39,350
Cramped.
I don't need it.

3958
03:05:39,660 --> 03:05:43,070
Don't need it for me.
And tom have the fans.

3959
03:05:43,071 --> 03:05:46,490
The fans probablY would appreciate it if
you would acquiesce.

3960
03:05:46,910 --> 03:05:47,930
I'll tell you what.
I'll tell you what.

3961
03:05:47,931 --> 03:05:49,460
Here's my deal.
I mean you guys.

3962
03:05:49,530 --> 03:05:51,440
Yeah.
If I do good cop,

3963
03:05:51,441 --> 03:05:55,220
bad cop in chicago or somewhere,
but go on the road and you want to scram

3964
03:05:55,221 --> 03:05:57,180
cammie for a weekend.
Scram.

3965
03:05:57,210 --> 03:06:00,350
Cam and they sleep on your stomach or 
back?

3966
03:06:01,120 --> 03:06:02,930
left side.
Left side.

3967
03:06:02,931 --> 03:06:05,750
Sober october.

3975
03:06:30,700 --> 03:06:31,740
Yeah.
You're doing scratch.

3976
03:06:31,800 --> 03:06:34,280
I'll describe him if you need me to.

3977
03:06:34,281 --> 03:06:35,114

I'd like you to shying away from the 

3978
03:06:36,411 --> 03:06:37,244

Yeah.

3979
03:06:37,370 --> 03:06:40,750
I want you to take classes.
Yoga classes.

3980
03:06:40,760 --> 03:06:43,340
You can tag on that or I don't know how 
I do that.

3981
03:06:43,850 --> 03:06:45,080
Tom,

3982
03:06:45,100 --> 03:06:45,770
Yeah.
What happened?

3983
03:06:45,770 --> 03:06:48,710
Okay.
He's doing yoga.

3984
03:06:48,730 --> 03:06:51,080
I'm saying no,
but Joe says no you.

3985
03:06:51,081 --> 03:06:52,460
You're the deciding vote.
Scram.

3986
03:06:52,461 --> 03:06:53,300
Cameron knows cram.
Cram,

3987
03:06:53,320 --> 03:06:54,153
cram camp.

3988
03:06:57,150 --> 03:06:58,140
I was playing.
Good cop.

3989
03:06:59,160 --> 03:06:59,993
Bad cop getS fucking crying.
So fucking district attorney just came 

3990

Scram camp.

3991
03:07:08,010 --> 03:07:08,843
Scram camp.
We got to set up notifications for the 

3992
03:07:10,531 --> 03:07:13,940

We'll all get a message if he be on this

3993
03:07:13,960 --> 03:07:14,793
grant,
like marijuana is acceptable during 

3994
03:07:19,801 --> 03:07:20,820
this.
I was like I said,

3995
03:07:20,821 --> 03:07:24,540
this is some shit that like men and 
women do when they're role playing games

3996
03:07:24,810 --> 03:07:25,643
like one plays,
the detective and the wife plays the 

3997
03:07:27,691 --> 03:07:31,560
lonely housewives drinking martinis.
Dick,

3998
03:07:32,040 --> 03:07:35,500
he should wear it like before we start 
and just fucking get hammered.

3999
03:07:35,530 --> 03:07:40,530
Let's see what the scram cam does.
We should just do this.

4000
03:07:42,110 --> 03:07:43,350

Go still go through shirts though.

4008
03:08:03,740 --> 03:08:08,220
Scotia has nothing to do with it.
Birth.com.

4009
03:08:08,970 --> 03:08:11,400
sober october.
Unless you're looking to buy tickets for

4010
03:08:11,401 --> 03:08:12,250
all birds.
Scram,

4011
03:08:14,280 --> 03:08:15,113
scram.
Canvas tests Australia on September 

4012
03:08:17,280 --> 03:08:17,430
31st.
Oh,

4013
03:08:17,430 --> 03:08:18,290

What?

4014
03:08:18,291 --> 03:08:20,100
What?
The dc improv at that show.

4015
03:08:20,250 --> 03:08:22,090
You will watch me go for my number 
first.

4016
03:08:22,140 --> 03:08:23,910
You might die.
You can't do september.

4017
03:08:23,911 --> 03:08:28,710
Third be you can't drunk that night.
September 31st september the day.

4018
03:08:28,770 --> 03:08:32,970
The date when the day starts,
he starts when he's already in dc.

4019
03:08:33,260 --> 03:08:33,841
No,
no what I'm saying.

4020
03:08:33,841 --> 03:08:36,180
But we're getting to October 31st is the
last day.

4021
03:08:36,400 --> 03:08:38,790
I said september,
september 30.

4022
03:08:38,791 --> 03:08:42,190
First to october for weight.
But what happened September 31st.

4023
03:08:42,200 --> 03:08:44,680
You've got to stop drinking and probably
drinking.

4024
03:08:46,050 --> 03:08:46,883
Oh,
you don't want to see what I registered 

4025
03:08:47,891 --> 03:08:52,891
him like going into october.
Yeah,

4026
03:08:53,050 --> 03:08:53,883
but.
So if he starts at midnight drunk 

4027
03:08:55,450 --> 03:09:00,450
because he got.
That's over 100 percent,

4028
03:09:01,561 --> 03:09:03,570
right?
You have to stop the 31st or september.

4029
03:09:03,570 --> 03:09:05,850
He's going to stop the 30th.
The evening of the 30th.

4030
03:09:05,910 --> 03:09:06,743
I stopped drinking.
So technically I have a full day of 

4031
03:09:09,001 --> 03:09:10,210
sobriety or wait,
wait.

4032
03:09:10,290 --> 03:09:10,531
No,
no,

4033
03:09:10,531 --> 03:09:10,920
no,
no.

4034
03:09:10,920 --> 03:09:12,540
There's only 30 days in september.
September.

4035
03:09:14,220 --> 03:09:16,770
Already.
What I'm saying is I need to stop a full

4036
03:09:16,770 --> 03:09:18,520
day before october starts.
Yeah,

4037
03:09:18,990 --> 03:09:19,823
29.
Okay.

4038
03:09:20,180 --> 03:09:21,390
Yeah.
So I start.

4039
03:09:21,391 --> 03:09:26,130
You want me no booze so that stuff I.
It was stopped by noon stuff.

4040
03:09:26,131 --> 03:09:28,780
I knew no one drinking the day.
No problem.

4041
03:09:28,810 --> 03:09:33,810
Then she started at 12:45
PM.

4042
03:09:34,960 --> 03:09:37,340
So bird story.
It's the day and we're drinking.

4043
03:09:37,350 --> 03:09:41,430
You say you don't drink in this episode,
brought to you by scram cam just brought

4044
03:09:41,431 --> 03:09:43,870
to you by day drinking high risk 
offenders.

4045
03:09:43,871 --> 03:09:47,400
It said the craziest thing you've ever 
said.

4046
03:09:47,401 --> 03:09:48,234
Well to red plastic cups.
I don't drink it every day while you 

4047
03:09:52,120 --> 03:09:53,970
drink.
Love the

4048
03:09:53,980 --> 03:09:57,370
hyperbole of me like I speak in 
hyperbole.

4049
03:09:57,880 --> 03:09:58,713
That's beautiful.
I speak like in a like whereby you find 

4050
03:10:00,791 --> 03:10:03,370
her way were you always win and that's a
really important thing.

4051
03:10:03,371 --> 03:10:06,250
If you want to get out of this drowning 
world of prosperity.

4052
03:10:07,920 --> 03:10:09,670
It is 30 days,
31 days.

4053
03:10:10,170 --> 03:10:11,440
October,
october.

4054
03:10:11,910 --> 03:10:14,140
So I will enter october sober is what 
you're saying?

4055
03:10:14,230 --> 03:10:15,280
Yeah.
Okay.

4056
03:10:15,670 --> 03:10:18,340
And then what's the physical part?
The 15 yoga sessions?

4057
03:10:18,860 --> 03:10:19,960
Sessions.
Sessions.

4058
03:10:21,670 --> 03:10:23,160
Ninety minutes.
Not bullshit.

4059
03:10:23,250 --> 03:10:26,020
Sixty minutes by the way,
by the way,

4060
03:10:26,140 --> 03:10:26,973
I'll be texting both you and I don't 
mind for that first week hitting you 

4061
03:10:29,921 --> 03:10:32,170
guys up and find them one that we can 
all do together.

4062
03:10:32,180 --> 03:10:34,760
Like go together.
Let me ask you a question.

4063
03:10:34,960 --> 03:10:36,580
Let me ask you a question about this hot
yoga.

4064
03:10:36,690 --> 03:10:38,950
Yeah.
So you're saying if it does get too hot,

4065
03:10:38,980 --> 03:10:41,590
it enters a dangerous zone.
I can just sit on the side,

4066
03:10:41,710 --> 03:10:43,240
drink a lot of water on the side.

4067
03:10:43,240 --> 03:10:45,220
You sit on your mat,
I'll drink a little water,

4068
03:10:45,221 --> 03:10:47,050
drinking lots of water,
but you don't have to leave safely.

4069
03:10:47,051 --> 03:10:48,320
You don't have to leave.
Don't be a pussy.

4070
03:10:48,610 --> 03:10:49,443
Okay,
but come on man in there and these are 

4071
03:10:52,720 --> 03:10:54,530
we adding that?
Like if you leave,

4072
03:10:54,860 --> 03:10:57,280
you leave in three minutes,
you're a loser.

4073
03:10:57,520 --> 03:11:01,930
You can't even give me three times.
We'll leave for four minutes each year.

4074
03:11:01,931 --> 03:11:03,540
Here's the other thing.
So wait,

4075
03:11:03,550 --> 03:11:04,331
that's decided.
No,

4076
03:11:04,331 --> 03:11:05,230
you can't.
Don't be a loser.

4077
03:11:05,260 --> 03:11:06,710
Not even a few times.
The 17.

4078
03:11:06,970 --> 03:11:10,240
You can't leave three times and start 
doing yoga very seriously.

4079
03:11:10,241 --> 03:11:13,240
Two and a half years ago,
I have left zero times.

4080
03:11:14,050 --> 03:11:14,883
What are the sex?
That's the only other thing we haven't 

4081
03:11:17,111 --> 03:11:19,180
talked about.
When yoU got to also say,

4082
03:11:19,240 --> 03:11:20,073
how do we.
How much water I have to bring in there 

4083
03:11:20,711 --> 03:11:21,544
to do that saFely.
We'll talk to you a gallon of water 

4084
03:11:25,950 --> 03:11:27,080
before you don't want to do.

4085
03:11:27,100 --> 03:11:29,080
Honestly,
I have like one of those flasks,

4086
03:11:29,150 --> 03:11:31,780
I think they're Called hydro flasks and 
it's giant.

4087
03:11:32,490 --> 03:11:34,900
It's sitting there.
It's really fat and wide.

4088
03:11:34,930 --> 03:11:35,763
Look at elephant deck,
fill it up with ice to top of small ice 

4089
03:11:38,981 --> 03:11:41,880
cubes and then I fill it up with water 
so that you know,

4090
03:11:41,950 --> 03:11:42,783
the ice has a lot of room for water.
It gets so there and then when I'm in 

4091
03:11:44,501 --> 03:11:49,501
class for that 90 minutes I'm drinking 
like cold water every,

4092
03:11:49,570 --> 03:11:51,340
you know,
five or six poses or something.

4093
03:11:51,341 --> 03:11:52,174
I tell you to take a break and have 
something by the end you have no water 

4094
03:11:53,681 --> 03:11:55,210
left.
Pretty close.

4095
03:11:55,240 --> 03:11:56,780
Usually I've just sort of like a little 
bit of ice.

4096
03:11:56,781 --> 03:11:59,980
So I've drank a whole 64 ounce thing in 
a 90 minute class.

4097
03:11:59,981 --> 03:12:00,814
It's hard to do man,
but I think that's one of this done in 

4098
03:12:04,241 --> 03:12:05,410
90 minutes.
This is what I think.

4099
03:12:05,411 --> 03:12:06,244
I think it's a real difficult to 60 mine
with yoga says the standard was 60 

4100
03:12:09,470 --> 03:12:12,910
minutes pussy when,
when you can get through it.

4101
03:12:13,150 --> 03:12:16,030
If you can get through 15 of those in 30
days,

4102
03:12:16,031 --> 03:12:17,950
I think you even fucking get through a 
lot of shit,

4103
03:12:17,951 --> 03:12:18,784
but I think you surprise yourself.
I think you're totally right and the 

4104
03:12:20,620 --> 03:12:22,750
amount of discipline it will you'll need
on two fronts.

4105
03:12:22,751 --> 03:12:23,770
That's great.
But here's the other thing.

4106
03:12:23,800 --> 03:12:24,680
You're such a cunt.

4107
03:12:24,730 --> 03:12:24,971
No,
no,

4108
03:12:24,971 --> 03:12:29,020
no.
Here's the last one.

4109
03:12:30,910 --> 03:12:33,250
Real stakes.
What does that mean?

4110
03:12:33,920 --> 03:12:34,790
Mistakes,
man.

4111
03:12:35,750 --> 03:12:37,850
One hundred Percent.
You get you lose your beard.

4112
03:12:38,100 --> 03:12:40,020
You had somebody,
a trowel chocolate.

4113
03:12:44,400 --> 03:12:45,233
Well asked you for what happened.
What's bmi is a measurement of the 

4114
03:12:52,520 --> 03:12:54,260
height and weight.
I said,

4115
03:12:54,261 --> 03:12:55,094
okay.
You at the height,

4116
03:12:55,350 --> 03:12:59,510
his height,
so just fucking measures height.

4117
03:12:59,600 --> 03:13:03,920
I'm six foot four man line.
There was no question.

4118
03:13:03,930 --> 03:13:08,930
It was trying to say

4119
03:13:31,760 --> 03:13:34,860
it was after you right now for enforcing
negative stereotypes.

4120
03:13:35,060 --> 03:13:35,893
Oh,

4121
03:13:35,960 --> 03:13:36,793
you are a measurement of height and when
they got the national to know how many 

4122
03:13:46,120 --> 03:13:46,953
tweets did you get a wealth.
I've got my nipple pierced diaper for 

4123
03:13:57,301 --> 03:13:58,580
dates.
It's true.

4124
03:14:03,390 --> 03:14:05,690
Your voice breaking like kevin 
mccallister.

4125
03:14:08,080 --> 03:14:13,080
I saiD these boys basketball game you 
did on your own.

4126
03:14:14,840 --> 03:14:18,330
I was in a fucking play the guitar with 
you guys are fucking eating pizza.

4127
03:14:18,331 --> 03:14:20,330
I was never.
Well you went to asia before.

4128
03:14:20,380 --> 03:14:21,213
Four months to get out of a bag.
Already went on a walkabout across asia 

4129
03:14:27,280 --> 03:14:29,890
where you can not reach him no fucking 
way,

4130
03:14:29,891 --> 03:14:31,260
man.
do you remember that guy?

4131
03:14:31,610 --> 03:14:33,990
The guy I met,
a guy in fucking some city somewhere.

4132
03:14:34,140 --> 03:14:35,620
He was like,
she couldn't pay up that bit.

4133
03:14:35,770 --> 03:14:40,770
Really just they're doing his duty,
slut shaming,

4134
03:14:44,060 --> 03:14:47,460
you know?
Some people shame you to me.

4135
03:14:47,560 --> 03:14:50,790
One day,
enjoyable to get on the road after shows

4136
03:14:50,791 --> 03:14:51,300
and be like,
alright,

4137
03:14:51,300 --> 03:14:53,730
we're going to be on the road.

4138
03:14:55,560 --> 03:14:57,690
I emailed you and saying I was going to 
fucking pay off.

4139
03:14:57,740 --> 03:15:01,800
That was my last test.
I said,

4140
03:15:02,040 --> 03:15:04,430
oh my god,
you barely passed five,

4141
03:15:04,440 --> 03:15:07,920
11 point seven,
point eight five and you got it,

4142
03:15:07,921 --> 03:15:08,390
but

4143
03:15:08,390 --> 03:15:11,620
it was fun to pile on you.
It was fun.

4144
03:15:12,460 --> 03:15:16,280
I'm telling you for real now.
The first 15 to 20 days I was out there.

4145
03:15:16,281 --> 03:15:18,740
I fucking angry at you guys for telling 
me I was a whale shark.

4146
03:15:18,830 --> 03:15:19,990
I was like,
these motherfuckers.

4147
03:15:20,290 --> 03:15:23,900
I gotta fucking calm down saying I'm a 
welsh measurement.

4148
03:15:23,901 --> 03:15:25,640
I don't feel like I said you were.
I tried to stay.

4149
03:15:25,650 --> 03:15:27,110
I really don't.
I tried to say that a two,

4150
03:15:27,111 --> 03:15:32,111
but the fans wouldn't have it somewhere 
in.

4151
03:15:34,070 --> 03:15:35,000
Woo.
We good?

4152
03:15:35,190 --> 03:15:36,023
Yeah,
we're good.

4153
03:15:36,080 --> 03:15:38,130
I remember you somewhere and then I was 
like,

4154
03:15:38,131 --> 03:15:38,990
uh,
someone's like,

4155
03:15:39,100 --> 03:15:40,100
burt,
you look skinny and,

4156
03:15:40,130 --> 03:15:41,780
and someone goes,
thomas fat.

4157
03:15:42,310 --> 03:15:43,160
And I go,
yeah.

4158
03:15:43,570 --> 03:15:44,200
I go,
well,

4159
03:15:44,200 --> 03:15:48,640
we don't know that we had a backhoe and 
then someone gelled as a jew.

4160
03:15:49,110 --> 03:15:49,943
Get paper towels.
Maybe I should have told this story it 

4161
03:15:51,391 --> 03:15:53,120
later.
Or is it jus?

4162
03:15:53,250 --> 03:15:54,083
Sorry.
Sorry.

4163
03:15:57,190 --> 03:16:00,030
Listen boys,
we're going to be fun.

4164
03:16:01,130 --> 03:16:06,130
Great.
That's totally bombs.

4165
03:16:07,390 --> 03:16:11,030
Oh no,
it was a check drops.

4166
03:16:11,790 --> 03:16:13,420
When you're trying to explain to game of
thrones,

4167
03:16:13,421 --> 03:16:15,280
does that bother you at all?
No,

4168
03:16:15,320 --> 03:16:15,730
I.
By the way,

4169
03:16:15,730 --> 03:16:19,780
I thought you stopped thinking about it.
Have you blocked it out?

4170
03:16:19,781 --> 03:16:20,614
How bad it was that now really for tom,
if you told a story like that center 

4171
03:16:25,680 --> 03:16:28,220
stage and told that story,
was that,

4172
03:16:28,280 --> 03:16:30,250
was that worse than the laugh lounge?
How would you feel?

4173
03:16:30,540 --> 03:16:33,750
What was it?
That would be my worst story ever.

4174
03:16:34,030 --> 03:16:36,310
That would be.
That would lower the standard.

4175
03:16:36,490 --> 03:16:38,680
What would you feel about yourself?
Would you be like,

4176
03:16:38,681 --> 03:16:41,020
did I have a seizure?
Like what went wrong?

4177
03:16:41,110 --> 03:16:42,700
I'd be like,
I drink too much.

4178
03:16:42,701 --> 03:16:43,750
I'm super fat.
My story

4179
03:16:52,980 --> 03:16:53,970
boys.
We're going to be fun.

4180
03:16:54,640 --> 03:16:55,473
Okay.
Okay,

4181
03:16:55,590 --> 03:16:59,520
so if you do these 15 year old class is 
90 minutes long each.

4182
03:16:59,580 --> 03:17:00,480
What are the stakes?
What?

4183
03:17:00,500 --> 03:17:01,380
Okay,
there we go.

4184
03:17:01,500 --> 03:17:06,130
That's what we started with in a 
marathon.

4185
03:17:06,300 --> 03:17:08,370
What if we do all these in my new 
studio?

4186
03:17:08,730 --> 03:17:10,090
All of the yoga class?
Yep.

4187
03:17:10,380 --> 03:17:12,150
We can get in there for a month.
We can get in,

4188
03:17:12,151 --> 03:17:13,450
but you have to.
I'll pay you.

4189
03:17:14,540 --> 03:17:17,370
I'll pay you to pay tv money.
You make.

4190
03:17:17,440 --> 03:17:21,720
Stick around a lot of money on the road,
but do you have to.

4191
03:17:21,721 --> 03:17:26,721
Do I get to see my family over that 
fucking neighborhood with all the time.

4192
03:17:31,140 --> 03:17:33,550
One of those women that looks like their
noses,

4193
03:17:33,570 --> 03:17:37,440
a pto and talked to her.
Take a walk on a saturday.

4194
03:17:37,441 --> 03:17:38,274
You asshole.
Find one with thick yarn hanging off 

4195
03:17:39,901 --> 03:17:41,460
their belt.
You'll be akin.

4196
03:17:44,100 --> 03:17:46,990
Just stay here with us when you need 
them.

4197
03:17:48,180 --> 03:17:49,290
They're always there.
They're inside.

4198
03:17:49,291 --> 03:17:50,124
All of us.
I don't know if I could sit here 

4199
03:17:50,990 --> 03:17:51,823
thinking how much fun it would be.
Why the fuck do you want to go to New 

4200
03:17:53,430 --> 03:17:58,430
York since october?
This is the best time with your.

4201
03:17:59,520 --> 03:18:00,730
Oh,
the hotdogs with her

4202
03:18:00,920 --> 03:18:05,920
could write this stage.

4203
03:18:09,660 --> 03:18:10,493
Listen,
listen,

4204
03:18:10,870 --> 03:18:13,000
listen to me.
I will rent you a house.

4205
03:18:13,060 --> 03:18:14,970
You,
you go on airbnb.

4206
03:18:14,980 --> 03:18:16,540
Oh,
pay for your house rental.

4207
03:18:16,541 --> 03:18:20,890
I'll pay for a rental car.
I'll pay for a rental car for the entire

4208
03:18:20,890 --> 03:18:23,380
month of october.
This is entire percent free for you.

4209
03:18:23,620 --> 03:18:25,450
I will pay.
I will give you a food allowance,

4210
03:18:25,451 --> 03:18:29,830
a daily food allowance.
Are you doing this article about that?

4211
03:18:29,831 --> 03:18:34,831
I have a lot of money for every podcast 
you do with me in that time period.

4212
03:18:36,750 --> 03:18:39,970
I like the brother.
Let's have some fun already.

4213
03:18:39,971 --> 03:18:40,970
Do it.
I want.

4214
03:18:41,680 --> 03:18:45,130
This is the challenge I'm taking.
I want you to be like,

4215
03:18:45,280 --> 03:18:47,830
you're not seeing your family for a all 
of us.

4216
03:18:47,831 --> 03:18:50,830
We're going to do yoga together 15 
times,

4217
03:18:51,070 --> 03:18:56,070
over 30 days old life there for a 
fucking month.

4218
03:18:57,040 --> 03:18:59,890
A chick you haven't fucked yet is your 
whole life already.

4219
03:19:00,010 --> 03:19:01,720
All you got to it.
On the east village,

4220
03:19:03,580 --> 03:19:04,570
you just called him out.

4221
03:19:05,430 --> 03:19:08,380
That's all like hanging out with big jay
lewis.

4222
03:19:08,440 --> 03:19:10,120
I get it.
Sow.

4223
03:19:10,150 --> 03:19:12,640
Come on man.
Come on and you're over here with us and

4224
03:19:13,030 --> 03:19:15,370
and all that's taken care of.
And you're here lewis.

4225
03:19:15,430 --> 03:19:18,040
He's talking about big jay oakerson.
He said big j dot lewis,

4226
03:19:18,070 --> 03:19:23,070
bigj in miami.
You guys and Louis Gomez.

4227
03:19:25,890 --> 03:19:28,660
It was a different person.
I know like big j dot lewis.

4228
03:19:29,200 --> 03:19:32,560
I said their names and in repetition 
we're off pace.

4229
03:19:32,561 --> 03:19:34,200
It's like if someone asks you for your 
phone number is three,

4230
03:19:34,201 --> 03:19:34,510
two,
three,

4231
03:19:34,510 --> 03:19:34,871
four,
five,

4232
03:19:34,871 --> 03:19:35,704
six,
seven,

4233
03:19:36,910 --> 03:19:37,990
eight,
nine spots.

4234
03:19:38,530 --> 03:19:41,770
Fucking a quarters on the ground here.
There's a lot to do,

4235
03:19:41,771 --> 03:19:42,604
man.
You can come and tyler listening make 

4236
03:19:45,371 --> 03:19:47,580
shoots with thinking about kidnapping.
Anyway,

4237
03:19:47,720 --> 03:19:49,120
learn how to stop.

4238
03:19:51,380 --> 03:19:53,980
I'm tired of being on the planet to 
knowing.

4239
03:19:54,640 --> 03:19:55,473
Stay over here,
dude.

4240
03:19:56,140 --> 03:19:59,010
For october we'll all be sober.
Will all go to the yoga classes.

4241
03:19:59,240 --> 03:20:02,400
Will get closer and we'll get healthier 
and we'll run a marathon.

4242
03:20:02,440 --> 03:20:03,273
Stop pretending that the comedy store is
the greatest place on the face of the 

4243
03:20:05,441 --> 03:20:06,910
earth.
I'm not pretending that.

4244
03:20:06,911 --> 03:20:08,680
I'm saying I want to be 3000 miles away 
from that.

4245
03:20:08,980 --> 03:20:10,600
That's what I'm saying.
Why are you doing?

4246
03:20:10,601 --> 03:20:11,920
Stop attending is not the greatest 
place.

4247
03:20:12,390 --> 03:20:13,690
You've got to Be here,
bro.

4248
03:20:14,140 --> 03:20:14,973
All of october to financial arrangement.
I'll rent you a corvette and right 

4249
03:20:23,501 --> 03:20:25,150
around the corner,
a black one,

4250
03:20:25,180 --> 03:20:30,180
a sleek new one.
If you get me a honda civic with gps,

4251
03:20:30,520 --> 03:20:31,353
listen,
you're going to drive a corvette like 

4252
03:20:32,580 --> 03:20:37,580
god damn americans.
I don't want him to drive a corvette.

4253
03:20:37,781 --> 03:20:41,680
You've never driven one.
Get the tacky on the highway to do that.

4254
03:20:41,680 --> 03:20:43,010
It'd be nice,
but not every day.

4255
03:20:43,360 --> 03:20:44,470
Girl.
It's no way.

4256
03:20:45,070 --> 03:20:47,620
I'm not driving of those.
That's a separate bucket.

4257
03:20:47,680 --> 03:20:52,330
And shelby mustang you can rent.
No,

4258
03:20:53,000 --> 03:20:53,833
no,
no,

4259
03:20:53,880 --> 03:20:54,713
no,
no.

4260
03:20:55,060 --> 03:20:57,280
How about this?
What about like,

4261
03:20:57,330 --> 03:21:00,970
give me a 67 mustang to drive around in 
for breaks are terrible.

4262
03:21:00,971 --> 03:21:03,210
You'd want a resto mod.
It's a lot of complications.

4263
03:21:04,600 --> 03:21:07,540
What about like,
if you're talking about like a new car,

4264
03:21:07,660 --> 03:21:08,220
a new car,
what?

4265
03:21:08,220 --> 03:21:11,920
I'm going to bmw and if I got to go to 
london for a week.

4266
03:21:11,940 --> 03:21:14,220
Oh yeah.
So it sits here and uh,

4267
03:21:14,270 --> 03:21:16,480
that's how life works when you're not 
here.

4268
03:21:16,481 --> 03:21:19,240
It doesn't drive itself.
It's not like herbie the love bug fuck.

4269
03:21:19,270 --> 03:21:21,340
But I'm saying what if I got to go to 
london for a week for press?

4270
03:21:21,360 --> 03:21:26,260
But I think I do go back to london for 
press.

4271
03:21:26,280 --> 03:21:27,340
Yeah.
I got to go to chicago.

4272
03:21:27,340 --> 03:21:29,990
So I'm doing here for 90 days.
You would probably be a week.

4273
03:21:29,991 --> 03:21:31,900
What are you doing for press in london?
What's going on in london?

4274
03:21:32,290 --> 03:21:36,760
I could do a netflix brunt of press from
fucking london one in New York.

4275
03:21:37,110 --> 03:21:38,800
Like what do you do?
You do radio over there,

4276
03:21:38,870 --> 03:21:40,890
which a panel shows and radio and 
podcasts.

4277
03:21:40,910 --> 03:21:42,610
ShIt,
you got to do that.

4278
03:21:42,870 --> 03:21:43,703
So you got to be stories.
You're going to arrive with stories and 

4279
03:21:46,610 --> 03:21:48,500
you're going to do sets out there as 
well or just say.

4280
03:21:48,501 --> 03:21:48,980
Yeah,
for sure.

4281
03:21:48,980 --> 03:21:51,620
For sure.
You have things scheduled yet or no?

4282
03:21:52,060 --> 03:21:52,893
No.
Okay.

4283
03:21:53,090 --> 03:21:54,580
So you're in your,
in your,

4284
03:21:54,581 --> 03:21:56,300
in your head.
So you're in.

4285
03:21:56,420 --> 03:21:58,850
So how many days is this?
You're talking about october.

4286
03:21:58,851 --> 03:21:59,684
and then go straight from here to go 
straight from here to the fucking joke 

4287
03:22:01,301 --> 03:22:02,134
was cruise me.
And you go to the summer that I got to 

4288
03:22:03,921 --> 03:22:06,420
meet in new orleans a couple days early.
No.

4289
03:22:06,950 --> 03:22:09,890
Nobody out in the next flight the two 
days before?

4290
03:22:09,980 --> 03:22:10,900
Nope.
Yeah.

4291
03:22:10,910 --> 03:22:11,743
Why not?
Two days before because I can't miss 

4292
03:22:12,501 --> 03:22:13,221
halloween.
Oh,

4293
03:22:13,221 --> 03:22:14,054
maybe I can.
the kids are used to not having you 

4294
03:22:15,801 --> 03:22:16,634
around.
Burt.

4295
03:22:18,710 --> 03:22:20,160
sorry.
Bad father.

4296
03:22:20,870 --> 03:22:25,870
Let's do it.
You have to submit your texting yet.

4297
03:22:26,880 --> 03:22:28,760
Guy texted them.
I haven't been replying.

4298
03:22:28,850 --> 03:22:29,481
Okay.
Okay.

4299
03:22:29,481 --> 03:22:32,430
Okay.
Stop this for hours.

4300
03:22:32,500 --> 03:22:35,900
Finish it off though.
We were not sober.

4301
03:22:35,901 --> 03:22:36,734
October,
october,

4302
03:22:36,740 --> 03:22:37,910
october.
Finish it off.

4303
03:22:38,710 --> 03:22:40,280
Finish it off.
And then correct it.

4304
03:22:40,340 --> 03:22:41,173
Okay.
I think we should talk about this and 

4305
03:22:42,221 --> 03:22:45,860
I'll announce it in the future.
Project was one.

4306
03:22:45,890 --> 03:22:47,390
Let's talk it out.
Ready?

4307
03:22:47,770 --> 03:22:52,770
Sobrato party october.
What's red octobers tasting here towards

4308
03:22:52,990 --> 03:22:53,823
doing it?
If we could figure it out like the 

4309
03:22:54,491 --> 03:22:56,060
corvette.
Be a black.

4310
03:22:56,210 --> 03:22:57,260
I like black.
I like black.

4311
03:22:57,261 --> 03:23:02,261
I love personal pain to me.
Makes me excited.

4312
03:23:03,920 --> 03:23:05,210
These are locked down.
Yellow.

4313
03:23:06,080 --> 03:23:08,780
A yellow corvette has already.
Come on,

4314
03:23:08,781 --> 03:23:09,614
bro.
They even gave me terentino's pussy 

4315
03:23:10,401 --> 03:23:14,360
wagon,
wagon kill bill.

4316
03:23:15,050 --> 03:23:17,810
Should we hold hands while we do this?
So if we do that,

4317
03:23:17,840 --> 03:23:19,730
if we do that,
if someone doesn't do it,

4318
03:23:19,731 --> 03:23:23,330
then what happens twice in four hours.
If someone doesn't do it.

4319
03:23:23,860 --> 03:23:26,000
I had to fly home to meet my family for 
three days,

4320
03:23:26,001 --> 03:23:28,940
then come back.
I didn'T go to london and come here,

4321
03:23:29,000 --> 03:23:29,833
face it here.
What is it takes a ton of money right 

4322
03:23:33,420 --> 03:23:35,240
now.
How about sobriety related?

4323
03:23:35,330 --> 03:23:36,163
How about the loser has to throw a party
for the other people in their honor and 

4324
03:23:41,870 --> 03:23:44,120
you have to do like ice sculptures and 
make it crazy.

4325
03:23:45,670 --> 03:23:47,630
Crazy.
I fucking hate you.

4326
03:23:47,631 --> 03:23:51,160
That's a great idea.
Why don't we do this all day?

4327
03:23:53,200 --> 03:23:58,200
And they're shooting sculptures like 
half limp dicks are dripping down.

4328
03:24:01,371 --> 03:24:05,450
IT takes longer for them to like break 
off and they all go into birth.

4329
03:24:05,480 --> 03:24:06,313
Mouth it.
Because if the artist is good enough to 

4330
03:24:14,271 --> 03:24:17,530
show how much you love,
it sticks to your face.

4331
03:24:17,600 --> 03:24:22,600
What's the measurable variable for.
For like if everybody gets to drown in.

4332
03:24:23,960 --> 03:24:25,360
No,
no what?

4333
03:24:26,100 --> 03:24:28,880
So if we all do it,
the capital on,

4334
03:24:28,930 --> 03:24:30,100
then the loser of that.
Oh,

4335
03:24:30,190 --> 03:24:31,790
okay.
So it carries over.

4336
03:24:31,880 --> 03:24:32,713
That's what we're before,
which he said before it was instead of 

4337
03:24:36,210 --> 03:24:37,220
marathon,
what he said before,

4338
03:24:37,221 --> 03:24:39,180
tom said before was,
um,

4339
03:24:39,440 --> 03:24:43,710
that he couldn't do 90 days,
but if he did do 90 days,

4340
03:24:43,770 --> 03:24:44,160
then

4341
03:24:44,160 --> 03:24:46,710
you could get the honor of challenge and
goes to a marathon,

4342
03:24:46,711 --> 03:24:47,544
which we'd never.
No,

4343
03:24:47,550 --> 03:24:47,901
no,
no,

4344
03:24:47,901 --> 03:24:48,540
no,
no.

4345
03:24:48,540 --> 03:24:49,373
The winter,
the winter calphalon for who's the best 

4346
03:24:53,681 --> 03:24:54,514
thing?
Shape.

4347
03:24:54,600 --> 03:24:55,630
That's good.
That's good.

4348
03:24:55,870 --> 03:24:56,703
And the loser,
the decathlon pays the winner of the 

4349
03:24:58,381 --> 03:25:00,900
decathlon.
The party.

4350
03:25:01,410 --> 03:25:03,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

4351
03:25:03,660 --> 03:25:05,070
So,
so here's what we're doing.

4352
03:25:05,260 --> 03:25:06,730
Okay.
Thirty days sober.

4353
03:25:06,770 --> 03:25:09,210
October 15,
15,

4354
03:25:09,360 --> 03:25:12,420
31 days sober.
October already in october.

4355
03:25:13,200 --> 03:25:14,480
Yes.
Can the,

4356
03:25:14,600 --> 03:25:18,900
can the loser also have to shower the 
winter in good words.

4357
03:25:19,260 --> 03:25:20,640
And um,
and praise.

4358
03:25:20,700 --> 03:25:23,130
I would love for a period of at least 
four minutes.

4359
03:25:23,610 --> 03:25:25,260
Interesting.
Maybe we should do it the opposite.

4360
03:25:25,440 --> 03:25:30,440
Maybe the winters shower,
the losers to rebuild their self esteem.

4361
03:25:31,540 --> 03:25:34,740
HorrifiC defeat.
I think of things show that burned up.

4362
03:25:34,810 --> 03:25:35,643
That's really what we're able to look at
that point because for sure die off 

4363
03:25:42,091 --> 03:25:45,570
round 13 yoga classes in six or seven 
days and no booze.

4364
03:25:45,600 --> 03:25:47,520
So once you fail,
can we all just stop,

4365
03:25:47,760 --> 03:25:51,270
stop talking to me directly if it's a 
competition we're all doing.

4366
03:25:51,780 --> 03:25:56,780
WHo do you think of this table would 
have the hardest time quitting booze for

4367
03:25:57,171 --> 03:26:00,830
sure.
Who do you probably already know way?

4368
03:26:01,500 --> 03:26:04,260
Especially in la when I drink for the 
first,

4369
03:26:04,261 --> 03:26:07,950
like 15 years that I knew I drank it at 
New York because it's a New York fucking

4370
03:26:07,951 --> 03:26:08,784
thing to do.
Yeah,

4371
03:26:08,910 --> 03:26:11,110
he barely drank in la.
I'd give him a drag.

4372
03:26:11,120 --> 03:26:13,620
Scott.
he'd go,

4373
03:26:14,490 --> 03:26:17,590
oh yeah,
you made disgusted.

4374
03:26:17,670 --> 03:26:18,503
What's wrong with you?

4375
03:26:20,970 --> 03:26:23,040
Sober from alcohol and october.
Yeah.

4376
03:26:23,440 --> 03:26:25,230
Who's,
who's goIng to have a hardest time?

4377
03:26:25,470 --> 03:26:28,170
The hardest topics.
That's nice.

4378
03:26:28,171 --> 03:26:29,004
That's beautiful.
who's going to have a breakthrough 

4379
03:26:29,700 --> 03:26:30,960
moment with the hot yoga?
Yoga?

4380
03:26:31,020 --> 03:26:33,870
Rogan will have the easiest time.
Uh,

4381
03:26:34,290 --> 03:26:35,123
I enjoy yoga.
I probably the hardest time because I 

4382
03:26:36,601 --> 03:26:38,790
get claustrophobic and never do it that 
much.

4383
03:26:38,791 --> 03:26:40,380
I Never do it.
Fifteen days,

4384
03:26:41,160 --> 03:26:41,993
30 days.
I'd never do it at the most I've ever 

4385
03:26:43,351 --> 03:26:46,860
done it ever is.
I think I did three times a week once.

4386
03:26:47,100 --> 03:26:49,320
I've done twice a week,
multiple times.

4387
03:26:49,500 --> 03:26:51,690
Most of tHe time I do one time a week.
Okay.

4388
03:26:51,691 --> 03:26:52,524
Let me ask you a question.
If I pass out and what people have to 

4389
03:26:54,280 --> 03:26:55,113
dragged out.
Dragged out in your mouth and then you 

4390
03:27:02,580 --> 03:27:06,390
don't.
You lose against your will.

4391
03:27:06,391 --> 03:27:10,230
They take you out of there and getting 
people to take you out backwards.

4392
03:27:10,480 --> 03:27:11,760
People against your will.
Cops.

4393
03:27:11,761 --> 03:27:15,200
I'll tell them the black.
Listen.

4394
03:27:15,270 --> 03:27:17,360
All you should do is when you get to 
like you got.

4395
03:27:17,440 --> 03:27:21,180
It's really on scout's honor.
When you get to an unmanageable state of

4396
03:27:21,181 --> 03:27:24,330
heat and exhaustion just laid down.
It's called savasana.

4397
03:27:24,331 --> 03:27:25,164
You laid down flat and just chill out 
and then when you feel like you've 

4398
03:27:27,301 --> 03:27:30,090
recovered a little bit and then you get 
back up and ritually yoga,

4399
03:27:31,140 --> 03:27:31,973
hot yoga is going to be 60 minutes.
Ninety minutes is better because it 

4400
03:27:36,350 --> 03:27:40,290
shows between 60 and 90.
That's what separates the girls from the

4401
03:27:40,291 --> 03:27:41,530
women.
I'm saying,

4402
03:27:41,610 --> 03:27:42,443
okay,

4403
03:27:42,490 --> 03:27:44,680
fine.
I'll be the woman girl here.

4404
03:27:44,770 --> 03:27:49,720
I'm just yoga break.
It's tom's a power lifter.

4405
03:27:49,721 --> 03:27:53,260
he's not even like cardio guy three 
times in a five minute break,

4406
03:27:53,261 --> 03:27:55,590
three of the 15 weeks,
no breaks,

4407
03:27:57,460 --> 03:27:59,680
break,
huge challenge,

4408
03:27:59,710 --> 03:28:00,543
no breaks pussies.
Let let it be a little challenging to 

4409
03:28:02,801 --> 03:28:04,750
you guys as well.
Health wise.

4410
03:28:04,810 --> 03:28:07,090
Let's get super challenging.
yeah,

4411
03:28:07,150 --> 03:28:09,400
I will quit drinking.
End to the yoga.

4412
03:28:09,730 --> 03:28:13,990
All you guys have to do is not drink,
which is a challenge.

4413
03:28:15,010 --> 03:28:16,660
And then do the yoga,
which is a huge.

4414
03:28:16,661 --> 03:28:18,850
I think what we might all fail on that.
Then what happens?

4415
03:28:19,330 --> 03:28:23,740
We're not going to,
not even one time convinced that I could

4416
03:28:23,741 --> 03:28:26,440
do it and uh,
I'm the one who does it all the time.

4417
03:28:26,441 --> 03:28:28,510
I'm saying we should be able to do it.
So three,

4418
03:28:28,511 --> 03:28:33,511
five minute breaks three times over the 
break room arguing as much as this.

4419
03:28:35,470 --> 03:28:36,490
And I didn't like.
All right,

4420
03:28:36,491 --> 03:28:38,830
good point.
The harder challenges me not drinking,

4421
03:28:38,860 --> 03:28:39,693
no breaks,
bitch,

4422
03:28:39,700 --> 03:28:40,800
no fluff,
sure fail.

4423
03:28:40,810 --> 03:28:45,810
And then I'm thinking to myself and then
the person who wins that challenge picks

4424
03:28:47,210 --> 03:28:49,510
that up and gets the name that the 
capital event.

4425
03:28:49,540 --> 03:28:50,373
We do some sort of a physIcal event.
What kind of shit be like a one day of 

4426
03:28:55,451 --> 03:28:58,660
bike race,
school track meet basically.

4427
03:28:58,661 --> 03:28:59,494
So the benefit.
Well we set up the benefit of choosing 

4428
03:29:02,740 --> 03:29:05,800
an olympiad.
You let's say you know you,

4429
03:29:06,010 --> 03:29:08,230
you're like,
well I'm the best sprinter or whatever,

4430
03:29:08,290 --> 03:29:12,430
so we have to do this sprint.
I'm the best at whatever pull up.

4431
03:29:12,431 --> 03:29:13,264
So you'd be like,
do we have to do like you named the 

4432
03:29:14,340 --> 03:29:19,340
events if you win against all the the 
winter and all the events,

4433
03:29:19,541 --> 03:29:20,620
you would just name it all on your 
favorite.

4434
03:29:21,420 --> 03:29:22,253
ObvIously.
Hold on,

4435
03:29:22,360 --> 03:29:25,420
but that,
that makes sense for suck dicks.

4436
03:29:27,270 --> 03:29:30,460
Dominate fucking nacho far.
No,

4437
03:29:30,461 --> 03:29:30,791
no,
no,

4438
03:29:30,791 --> 03:29:31,720
no.
it's not physical.

4439
03:29:32,040 --> 03:29:32,873
It's a physical events.
We'd all have to have some say you have 

4440
03:29:35,120 --> 03:29:37,740
more say.
AlrigHt,

4441
03:29:37,840 --> 03:29:40,630
what would you choose if you had the 
opportunity to create a gauntlet?

4442
03:29:40,890 --> 03:29:42,910
A gauntlet of different difficult 
exercises.

4443
03:29:42,950 --> 03:29:47,950
Got it for 40 a 100 yard dash.
How about four?

4444
03:29:50,760 --> 03:29:54,550
So sprinting a 4:40
is one a quarter mile,

4445
03:29:54,850 --> 03:29:56,830
quarter mile,
and then a hundred yard dash.

4446
03:29:56,831 --> 03:29:57,664
okay.
This to to run a break in here and say 

4447
03:29:58,931 --> 03:30:01,300
that's a long distance from a marathon.
you fucking.

4448
03:30:01,460 --> 03:30:01,931
No,
no,

4449
03:30:01,931 --> 03:30:02,830
no,
but that's what I think.

4450
03:30:02,960 --> 03:30:05,880
That's where I think I'd accept.
That's where I think excel.

4451
03:30:05,890 --> 03:30:06,820
You asshole.

4452
03:30:13,210 --> 03:30:17,600
You fucking liar.
You ain't fucking.

4453
03:30:17,870 --> 03:30:18,703
I do an 800 and a sprint.
I definitely do a model running stuff 

4454
03:30:22,700 --> 03:30:23,570
stuff.
No biking,

4455
03:30:23,590 --> 03:30:24,810
no swimming.
No fucking on.

4456
03:30:24,880 --> 03:30:26,680
Hold on.
I get to pick the fucking marathon.

4457
03:30:26,681 --> 03:30:28,180
That's why I picked it.
Wait a minute.

4458
03:30:28,240 --> 03:30:30,460
So you thInk that you could win one of 
these things?

4459
03:30:30,790 --> 03:30:34,030
I could win a number of these types.
What things do you think you could win?

4460
03:30:34,180 --> 03:30:37,400
100 yard dash three slash four.
You think you could win?

4461
03:30:39,200 --> 03:30:40,800
What do you.
No way.

4462
03:30:41,820 --> 03:30:46,700
Who do you think you think?
I definitely got tommy in this.

4463
03:30:47,240 --> 03:30:49,490
No,
he just said right now.

4464
03:30:49,491 --> 03:30:52,020
I don't think you can.
No,

4465
03:30:52,120 --> 03:30:52,953
no,
no,

4466
03:30:53,210 --> 03:30:54,043
no.
I think you could beat me in a mile for 

4467
03:30:54,831 --> 03:30:56,360
sure.
I don't tHink you went in a mile.

4468
03:30:56,450 --> 03:30:57,860
I'd definitely beat you in a mile.
I did.

4469
03:30:57,900 --> 03:30:59,650
I beat you in an 800.
You know that.

4470
03:30:59,690 --> 03:31:01,490
Where do you went on a sprint?
Off the blocks.

4471
03:31:02,250 --> 03:31:04,670
Yeah.
I beat tommy in the sprint 100 percent.

4472
03:31:05,600 --> 03:31:07,340
By the way.
This is why the decathlon is going to be

4473
03:31:07,341 --> 03:31:09,440
interesting because we all get to pick 
our events.

4474
03:31:09,860 --> 03:31:13,250
What we do is everyone who does it come 
in first place.

4475
03:31:13,251 --> 03:31:16,310
I had the opportunity to come in first 
place because I didn't drink for a whole

4476
03:31:16,310 --> 03:31:17,143
month and I did.
THe yoga can beat him at sprint for 

4477
03:31:19,251 --> 03:31:20,084
sure.
Of course.

4478
03:31:22,130 --> 03:31:24,230
Here's your list.
Of course.

4479
03:31:24,400 --> 03:31:26,900
Of course.
If you win,

4480
03:31:27,160 --> 03:31:31,460
you should get to pick two events.
Listen,

4481
03:31:31,461 --> 03:31:31,941
listen,
listen,

4482
03:31:31,941 --> 03:31:32,490
listen,
listen,

4483
03:31:32,490 --> 03:31:34,890
listen.
Let's see.

4484
03:31:36,950 --> 03:31:37,783
Let's say it's five events.
I'm just making her motherfucking 

4485
03:31:43,850 --> 03:31:45,610
weekend.
We called it the cap on.

4486
03:31:45,630 --> 03:31:50,630
We have to call doodads on tech.
It has to be for track and field events.

4487
03:31:51,650 --> 03:31:56,650
Total of 10 meter sprint,
110 meter hurdles.

4488
03:31:57,681 --> 03:32:00,530
Four hundred meter event,
1500 meter long jump,

4489
03:32:00,560 --> 03:32:05,520
high swimming.
No,

4490
03:32:05,990 --> 03:32:07,630
we don't want those.
We're not doing the swimming,

4491
03:32:07,640 --> 03:32:09,020
biking and running.
We met.

4492
03:32:09,050 --> 03:32:14,050
We met in the camps who were saying for 
track for track or track advantage.

4493
03:32:19,370 --> 03:32:23,540
Let me draw them and stuff.
It's trauma and kettlebell over a over a

4494
03:32:23,750 --> 03:32:24,583
jesus combine involved in this.
Are you are definitely involved out of 

4495
03:32:29,120 --> 03:32:32,390
this is for me not to drink in october.
We don't need to do yoga with you.

4496
03:32:32,510 --> 03:32:33,110
We all hang out.

4497
03:32:33,110 --> 03:32:35,330
We all have a good time all throughout 
october.

4498
03:32:35,510 --> 03:32:36,570
Hold on.
Oh,

4499
03:32:36,920 --> 03:32:37,341
sorry.
Sorry.

4500
03:32:37,341 --> 03:32:37,850
Go ahead.
Sorry.

4501
03:32:37,850 --> 03:32:40,970
Go ahead then and then we all beat me in
a 100 yard dash.

4502
03:32:42,250 --> 03:32:43,970
No,
wait,

4503
03:32:45,320 --> 03:32:46,153
hold on.
Hold on.

4504
03:32:46,610 --> 03:32:48,980
Special bonus points.
If you beat rogan in any event,

4505
03:32:49,740 --> 03:32:54,410
a that's a lot lighter than you man.
And in shape.

4506
03:32:55,170 --> 03:32:56,003
I mean you're both in great shape,
but she has to be confident to say that 

4507
03:33:04,491 --> 03:33:07,340
I would beat you if you weren't so 
confident to say he'd beat everybody.

4508
03:33:07,341 --> 03:33:08,171
I'm like,
he doesn't know worse.

4509
03:33:08,171 --> 03:33:09,004
You wouldn't be,
but you'd be japanese guy walking out 

4510
03:33:11,391 --> 03:33:14,730
and pride in it,
but you're not covered.

4511
03:33:15,950 --> 03:33:20,480
And I'm fading.
Seventy eight pounds lighter than you at

4512
03:33:20,490 --> 03:33:25,490
least to 50 50.
I'm getting being nice.

4513
03:33:26,001 --> 03:33:28,450
You're 3:50.
How much do you weigh now?

4514
03:33:29,410 --> 03:33:32,570
Twenty two to 22.
When I get up,

4515
03:33:32,630 --> 03:33:34,580
I take a leak in the morning and then I 
weighed myself.

4516
03:33:34,581 --> 03:33:36,360
I'm about one 95.
Wow.

4517
03:33:36,510 --> 03:33:38,110
It might go.
That's

4518
03:33:38,120 --> 03:33:39,400
it.
That's what advantage is.

4519
03:33:39,420 --> 03:33:40,253
Definitely much lighter bodied.
I do have like when it comes to muscle 

4520
03:33:43,471 --> 03:33:44,304
twitch,
I got that long strands that run I do 

4521
03:33:47,671 --> 03:33:48,990
with me one day.
Okay.

4522
03:33:49,390 --> 03:33:50,223
Yeah,
that crazy.

4523
03:33:51,170 --> 03:33:55,000
Tell me one,
tell them why men love to do it.

4524
03:33:55,001 --> 03:33:58,380
I'd love to do it.
Do man listen to that on your.

4525
03:33:58,381 --> 03:34:02,070
On the hike or playing.
I loved it and I was like,

4526
03:34:02,280 --> 03:34:03,990
I know you guys smoked a joint before 
the uphill.

4527
03:34:04,050 --> 03:34:04,883
Nope.
Open for that paleo and get down to the 

4528
03:34:06,230 --> 03:34:08,130
basin and I was like,
I would never.

4529
03:34:08,131 --> 03:34:08,964
I would never be able to do that because
I would totally be huffing and puffing 

4530
03:34:11,131 --> 03:34:12,150
up it up hill.
No,

4531
03:34:12,151 --> 03:34:15,120
honestly mad at it actually dilates your
lungs.

4532
03:34:15,121 --> 03:34:17,550
I do cardio after I smoke weed all the 
time.

4533
03:34:17,730 --> 03:34:18,563
I can't do that.
Go longer because you doing literally 

4534
03:34:20,731 --> 03:34:21,420
can go longer.

4535
03:34:21,420 --> 03:34:22,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

4536
03:34:22,190 --> 03:34:23,023
But you know,
I think jamie knows jimmy marathon 

4537
03:34:25,651 --> 03:34:26,484
runners that blase,
but they'll smoke a little bit before 

4538
03:34:28,441 --> 03:34:29,370
they run their.
Cool.

4539
03:34:29,460 --> 03:34:30,293
My thought on all of this is it would be
nice if we all did something just like 

4540
03:34:33,601 --> 03:34:35,970
your weight loss challenge did,
but I think the weight loss challenge,

4541
03:34:35,971 --> 03:34:36,804
we might've missed the mark quite 
honestly with the idea that you guys 

4542
03:34:39,061 --> 03:34:42,200
could be hydrate yourself.
I mr mark [inaudible].

4543
03:34:42,210 --> 03:34:43,680
I said that's what.
That's where three straight days,

4544
03:34:43,740 --> 03:34:44,580
no,
but what I'm saying,

4545
03:34:45,750 --> 03:34:47,520
because they wouldn't listen.
Are you wrong?

4546
03:34:47,521 --> 03:34:48,354
Because that's super bad for your body.
That's like insanely bad for your body 

4547
03:34:51,001 --> 03:34:53,910
to be that dehydrated three days in a 
row and drinking's not bad.

4548
03:34:54,390 --> 03:34:57,050
It's not nearly as bad as dehydrating 
yourself like that.

4549
03:34:57,190 --> 03:34:58,023
Drinking is normal.
Your body is normally processing 

4550
03:35:00,301 --> 03:35:02,190
alcohol.
If you drink on a normal basis,

4551
03:35:02,430 --> 03:35:03,263
your liver processes that,
but when you dehydrate yourself like 15 

4552
03:35:05,821 --> 03:35:10,821
pounds of water or like a yoga class,
you're body's not firing 64 ounces while

4553
03:35:11,221 --> 03:35:12,054
you're in class.

4554
03:35:12,380 --> 03:35:15,990
You're gonna get a fucking great gallon 
in the middle of the class.

4555
03:35:16,440 --> 03:35:17,330
I do think.
Wait,

4556
03:35:18,270 --> 03:35:19,590
hold on,
hold on.

4557
03:35:19,950 --> 03:35:23,280
Before you go and come on,
stop.

4558
03:35:23,281 --> 03:35:24,114
Hold on.
Every of us I think twice in this 

4559
03:35:26,521 --> 03:35:26,990
podcast.
I'm.

4560
03:35:26,990 --> 03:35:27,511
Yep.
Again,

4561
03:35:27,511 --> 03:35:31,170
you've got to give you a chance to pee 
out in our makeup.

4562
03:35:31,910 --> 03:35:33,340
This is all mental.
Why?

4563
03:35:33,370 --> 03:35:35,700
Why would you not be able to do it?
If I can do it,

4564
03:35:35,701 --> 03:35:37,860
of course you can do it.
Different sizes.

4565
03:35:39,710 --> 03:35:41,370
That's one reason you can do it,
man.

4566
03:35:41,810 --> 03:35:43,950
You gotta let me pick.
If I run it out,

4567
03:35:45,970 --> 03:35:48,900
you get 90 seconds.
Here's better.

4568
03:35:48,901 --> 03:35:49,711
Better.
We're going to do it.

4569
03:35:49,711 --> 03:35:52,210
We're going to put plastic down and to 
let You pick your parents.

4570
03:35:53,330 --> 03:35:55,860
Gotta hang in there.
If you get me a bottle at a corner where

4571
03:35:55,861 --> 03:35:57,540
nobody can see it,
I can do that,

4572
03:35:57,900 --> 03:36:02,880
but a corner somewhere like a that the 
fucking room.

4573
03:36:02,880 --> 03:36:05,160
Where got the shit in?
This is his escape clause.

4574
03:36:05,190 --> 03:36:06,110
No,
come on you guys.

4575
03:36:08,100 --> 03:36:09,580
You can't do an hour and a half without 
pen.

4576
03:36:09,740 --> 03:36:10,573
Might not.
Sometimes I can sometimes have to pee 

4577
03:36:14,191 --> 03:36:18,240
before you go into class and you'll be 
so dehydrated while the is going on.

4578
03:36:18,300 --> 03:36:19,133
You will be drinking water.
You won't even have to pay because you 

4579
03:36:20,621 --> 03:36:23,100
have to get out so bad.
If we don't have to be to.

4580
03:36:23,210 --> 03:36:25,320
I can take.
I take soMebody wiTh me to show.

4581
03:36:25,321 --> 03:36:26,430
Look,
he's actually paying.

4582
03:36:26,520 --> 03:36:30,590
Or you could just hold it in.
I mean you couldn't hold it friday.

4583
03:36:31,360 --> 03:36:33,920
I'll try to life depended on you holding
you.

4584
03:36:35,290 --> 03:36:36,123
Can you

4585
03:36:37,890 --> 03:36:40,120

Hold on.

4586
03:36:40,390 --> 03:36:45,390
I'm a jew.
I'm a jew.

4587
03:36:51,641 --> 03:36:52,960
Yep.
Yep.

4588
03:36:52,990 --> 03:36:54,880
I'm just saying I'll try not to pee,
but like,

4589
03:36:54,881 --> 03:36:56,230
come on guys.
If I really haVe to pay,

4590
03:36:56,290 --> 03:36:59,020
what are you going to do?
I'm not going to piss my pants.

4591
03:36:59,110 --> 03:37:01,230
I'll tell you what.
There's not a chance in the world.

4592
03:37:01,360 --> 03:37:05,050
There's a way that I could have to pee 
so bad that I couldn't hold it in for an

4593
03:37:05,050 --> 03:37:06,160
hour and a half.
I'll tell you what,

4594
03:37:06,340 --> 03:37:08,620
five people for batman,

4595
03:37:08,790 --> 03:37:10,780

Will you vowed to pee before every class

4597
03:37:15,570 --> 03:37:16,403

if you have to get up and pee a lot 

4598
03:37:19,820 --> 03:37:20,653
beforehand,
the odds of me not having to pay not 

4599
03:37:22,170 --> 03:37:25,110
only think about a little crazy.
Do they have much water?

4600
03:37:25,120 --> 03:37:30,120
The fIrst five classes?
no more paying classwork and piss in the

4601
03:37:32,831 --> 03:37:33,664
class.

4602
03:37:34,500 --> 03:37:38,680
Find me a safe here.
If you gave me a safety,

4603
03:37:38,830 --> 03:37:42,840
a safe space where I can piss in public 
and not to fucking jail.

4604
03:37:43,490 --> 03:37:45,460
No asparagus.
Mother fucker.

4605
03:37:45,490 --> 03:37:46,323

4613
03:38:09,510 --> 03:38:10,850
Like what kind of car would you drive

4614
03:38:10,920 --> 03:38:12,300

03:38:57,850 --> 03:38:59,770
Had toyotas are like bulletproof.
Yeah.

4629
03:38:59,771 --> 03:39:04,771
They're bad ass a day off.
If it's like a really nice night where I

4630
03:39:05,021 --> 03:39:06,510
could go out there.
Wait for drinking.

4631
03:39:06,620 --> 03:39:07,540

It wasn't.

4639
03:39:18,340 --> 03:39:23,340
I wouldn't have to fucking put that shit
back down.

4640
03:39:26,790 --> 03:39:31,790
Can we get it wrapped around october?
Wrapped it

4641
03:39:34,170 --> 03:39:36,590
all up.
Get it wrapped.

4642
03:39:37,010 --> 03:39:38,510
Maybe we should get it wrapped with 
that.

4643
03:39:38,540 --> 03:39:40,610
What was that one?
That one.

4644
03:39:40,850 --> 03:39:44,530
Eat mushrooms tee shirt that you came at
me in the face.

4645
03:39:47,780 --> 03:39:48,613
I'd have more of an issue.
Second note that I see the value in 

4646
03:39:50,811 --> 03:39:52,120
that.
To this.

4647
03:39:52,180 --> 03:39:56,630

4649
03:39:57,300 --> 03:39:58,133
That's rude.
What about I rent you a car and I put 

4650
03:40:00,231 --> 03:40:03,470
that all over the car.
Is that okay?

03:40:16,660 --> 03:40:17,600
Look it.
Turn to your left.

Look to your left real quick so you're

How about name?
We don't need your name.

4659
03:40:24,441 --> 03:40:26,690
We just use that image.
Only that image on the hood,

4660
03:40:27,330 --> 03:40:28,610
but it looked like anymore.

03:40:58,320 --> 03:41:00,020
the hood,

4687
03:41:51,710 --> 03:41:53,630

So we're going to review it.

4688
03:41:53,631 --> 03:41:55,700
I'm going to review it on a podcast.

The comedic value drive it and you 
realize it's a goddamn 2017 spaceship.

4696
03:42:23,150 --> 03:42:23,983
Wow.
I think the zero to 60 in like three 

4697
03:42:25,491 --> 03:42:27,170
seconds.
I think it's too cool.

4698
03:42:27,230 --> 03:42:31,190
And to bring it down a notch back on the
tail of the car,

4699
03:42:31,350 --> 03:42:32,160
it has to say I'm

4700
03:42:32,160 --> 03:42:32,993
a comedian.

4701
03:42:34,290 --> 03:42:38,390
Exclamation point.
That's horrible.

4702
03:42:40,350 --> 03:42:42,770
Yoga.
Come on,

03:42:43,100 --> 03:42:45,830
look at that image and look at that hood
scoop and scoop.

4704
03:42:46,410 --> 03:42:48,930
Scoop that thing on the hood.
That thing in five minutes.

4705
03:42:49,970 --> 03:42:51,610
That's gonna be where the fucking 
stairs.

4706
03:42:52,920 --> 03:42:54,590
yeah.
That's where the wrap gets put down.

4707
03:42:55,060 --> 03:43:00,060
I like to sign off already to sign off.
Sign off and it says I'm a funny guy.

4708
03:43:01,580 --> 03:43:06,380
You have american men run hot blooded 
american males are furious that you even

4709
03:43:06,520 --> 03:43:09,020
bulkier.
I'll do that if you'll let me.

4710
03:43:09,021 --> 03:43:12,380
Fuck.
Fucking hot yoga class.

4711
03:43:12,410 --> 03:43:13,243
You have to be again.
Don't.

4712
03:43:13,430 --> 03:43:15,150
Of course I knew I had to 15 minutes 
ago.

4713
03:43:15,280 --> 03:43:17,520
We'll green light.
You breathing in yoga class.

4714
03:43:18,330 --> 03:43:19,880
Go pee.
Go pee.

4715
03:43:19,881 --> 03:43:22,040
We're going to hang out with.
I can fucking.

4716
03:43:22,041 --> 03:43:24,100
Pete thinks she'd be able to pee.
That's ridiculous.

4717
03:43:24,410 --> 03:43:26,900
He's concerned about this while you were
out there.

4718
03:43:26,970 --> 03:43:31,590
I don't think we got as far as I thought
we were going to fuck.

4719
03:43:31,680 --> 03:43:32,820
No shit.
Right?

4720
03:43:32,821 --> 03:43:33,654
I mean we're four and a half hours in 
because we barely have a barely have a 

4721
03:43:36,961 --> 03:43:39,270
handle on how the fuck this is going to 
go down.

4722
03:43:39,510 --> 03:43:44,510
I heard handled thought about tito's.
That's the book.

4723
03:43:44,640 --> 03:43:47,010
Put up a pull up,
2017 camaro,

4724
03:43:47,011 --> 03:43:47,844
zl one nurburgring time.
I think they just got some insane 

4725
03:43:51,631 --> 03:43:53,910
nurburgring time.
I think it was faster than the corvette.

4726
03:43:53,911 --> 03:43:55,890
Zero six.
That's a crazy car,

4727
03:43:55,891 --> 03:43:58,290
man.
Americans doing some nutty shit now man.

4728
03:43:58,410 --> 03:44:02,100
They're developing these vehicles.
They're just off the chart now.

4729
03:44:02,101 --> 03:44:06,240
This one is the most exciting new 
american car in in years right now,

4730
03:44:06,300 --> 03:44:07,320
for example,
beast and it's.

4731
03:44:07,370 --> 03:44:08,203
It's an affordable car comparatively 
compared to the kind of performance of 

4732
03:44:11,761 --> 03:44:12,594
the other cars like it.
Seven minutes and 23 seconds In the 

4733
03:44:15,451 --> 03:44:16,284
nuremberg ring.

4734
03:44:16,350 --> 03:44:19,920
That's faster than the nine slash 11 gt 
two rs.

4735
03:44:20,190 --> 03:44:23,310
That's just under a mclaren f one,
which is like,

4736
03:44:23,330 --> 03:44:24,163
well how much is that?
Like a million more than a million and 

4737
03:44:26,371 --> 03:44:29,310
just under the a c,
six corvette.

4738
03:44:29,311 --> 03:44:31,950
Z o six.
And the dodge viper acr.

4739
03:44:32,130 --> 03:44:36,630
So it's like one second,
one second point seven under the a dodge

4740
03:44:36,631 --> 03:44:40,380
viper and the [inaudible] is seven to 19
is.

4741
03:44:40,450 --> 03:44:43,560
It's such a crazy fast cars.
The point,

4742
03:44:43,800 --> 03:44:46,400
I mean the difference between one second
here,

4743
03:44:46,420 --> 03:44:47,253
there is just a lot of that times it's 
understanding the core course 

4744
03:44:50,731 --> 03:44:52,710
conditions,
driver error.

4745
03:44:52,860 --> 03:44:53,693
I mean you're talking about like really 
close margins so it would have it's 

4746
03:44:56,430 --> 03:45:01,430
super car and absolute supercar.
It's impressive and I had never got into

4747
03:45:01,501 --> 03:45:04,590
cars but I think that's like so much 
fun.

4748
03:45:05,250 --> 03:45:06,083
I'll probably drive it on the open road 
and if I die on your heads so you're on 

4749
03:45:08,731 --> 03:45:09,564
it.
You're on it

4750
03:45:10,980 --> 03:45:15,710
juSt on the creek and a bunch of water 
beforehand and durIng.

4751
03:45:15,890 --> 03:45:18,110
It's like you're just telling me I'm 
going to lose the tail of the car.

4752
03:45:18,111 --> 03:45:20,050
Has to say got jokes,
but the,

4753
03:45:20,060 --> 03:45:24,020
as a compromise I could come off.
Funny guy or comedian.

4754
03:45:24,021 --> 03:45:26,390
I'm a comedian guy.
Funny guy.

4755
03:45:26,420 --> 03:45:27,950
Funny guy.
But this big.

4756
03:45:28,610 --> 03:45:30,640
How about do you think I'm funny?
No way.

4757
03:45:31,000 --> 03:45:35,840
I see website,
yes or no?

4758
03:45:37,440 --> 03:45:38,200
No.
Okay.

4759
03:45:38,200 --> 03:45:39,033
How about nita laugh.
They laugh and then you go number dick 

4760
03:45:43,040 --> 03:45:44,020
for chuckles.
Yeah.

4761
03:45:44,021 --> 03:45:45,280
That's good.
Let's do that.

4762
03:45:45,790 --> 03:45:48,220
We got through a lot on this podcast.
I'm super glad we did it.

4763
03:45:48,221 --> 03:45:50,020
Okay,
so then we choose the decathlon.

4764
03:45:50,080 --> 03:45:51,670
It's three events,
three events.

4765
03:45:51,671 --> 03:45:53,880
The winner gets four.
What is going on?

4766
03:45:53,940 --> 03:45:55,310
Like physical events?
Yeah,

4767
03:45:55,410 --> 03:45:58,690
like runs to find out if anyone is 
really in fitness,

4768
03:45:58,840 --> 03:45:59,673
sort of.
Everyone completes it and you're a 

4769
03:46:02,410 --> 03:46:03,243
psychopath that you're writing like 
you're talking like this fitness 

4770
03:46:06,130 --> 03:46:09,830
certainty is so hilarious.
You have to reach your arm,

4771
03:46:11,200 --> 03:46:13,120
your alarms.
Like my mom after jazzercise.

4772
03:46:15,940 --> 03:46:19,670
I love your level of delusion though.
Not the illusion.

4773
03:46:20,290 --> 03:46:21,630
Reality.
Okay.

4774
03:46:21,631 --> 03:46:22,464
What's the reality like?
Is the sky you'd like the hardest core 

4775
03:46:28,071 --> 03:46:28,750
trump fan.
It was like,

4776
03:46:28,750 --> 03:46:31,690
we're doing a great job by you in great 
shape.

4777
03:46:32,500 --> 03:46:35,460
I'm not in great shape.
Why?

4778
03:46:35,530 --> 03:46:39,730
I didn't like.
I remember one time I remember saying to

4779
03:46:39,731 --> 03:46:42,970
you one time I said something about 
being famous.

4780
03:46:42,971 --> 03:46:43,804
You go,
bro,

4781
03:46:44,250 --> 03:46:45,430
you're not famous.
And I was like,

4782
03:46:45,431 --> 03:46:46,270
no,
I definitely am.

4783
03:46:46,750 --> 03:46:47,650
And you're like,
no,

4784
03:46:47,740 --> 03:46:50,830
I'm not famous.
You're definitely not too late.

4785
03:46:50,831 --> 03:46:52,440
You're talking to joe,
joe,

4786
03:46:52,500 --> 03:46:53,890
joe and joe.
And I was like,

4787
03:46:53,950 --> 03:46:54,760
oh,
that was good.

4788
03:46:54,760 --> 03:46:57,970
It was good leveler of what fame was.
I was like,

4789
03:46:58,300 --> 03:47:01,000
you get recognized a couple of times,
like a day or a day.

4790
03:47:01,001 --> 03:47:03,130
If you get recognized at all in a week,
you're like,

4791
03:47:03,370 --> 03:47:04,203
oh,
that's crazy.

4792
03:47:04,810 --> 03:47:06,550
Uh,
I think the fitness thing,

4793
03:47:07,300 --> 03:47:09,820
I think if I don't drink,
I feel like I feel much better.

4794
03:47:09,850 --> 03:47:12,460
I feel like we went back in time.
You do another game of thrones thing.

4795
03:47:12,610 --> 03:47:13,443
Jesus

4796
03:47:13,520 --> 03:47:14,380
right?

4797
03:47:19,110 --> 03:47:23,790
pilot son tells me,
have the second episode.

4798
03:47:25,960 --> 03:47:26,793
Raven took over the boy's body size back
deep into his head and hold your 

4799
03:47:31,981 --> 03:47:35,580
protection.
So painful in various being assholes.

4800
03:47:37,060 --> 03:47:37,980
Um,
um.

4801
03:47:38,280 --> 03:47:40,040
Oh yeah.
Um,

4802
03:47:40,470 --> 03:47:44,130
okay.
If,

4803
03:47:44,250 --> 03:47:46,460
if everyone does the 30 day challenge,
yes.

4804
03:47:47,040 --> 03:47:47,873
Then we do a decathlon winner.
Why do you want to do like a physical 

4805
03:47:53,440 --> 03:47:54,690
coach?
I don't care.

4806
03:47:54,770 --> 03:47:55,603
Where do you put it?
How about the fucking parties after the 

4807
03:47:57,721 --> 03:47:59,120
30 days,
30 days,

4808
03:47:59,220 --> 03:48:00,420
and if we all do it,
then what?

4809
03:48:02,490 --> 03:48:03,323
We shouldn't make this too complicated 
because we always keep doing them after 

4810
03:48:05,260 --> 03:48:08,100
our realizes that la is way better than 
New York decides to stay.

4811
03:48:08,101 --> 03:48:08,934
Stay bitchy.
putting in november and you'll make the 

4812
03:48:11,730 --> 03:48:13,670
best month in worked best.
Oh my god.

4813
03:48:13,680 --> 03:48:18,060
The bagels thrown unstoppable.
How about no dogs arE ripe.

4814
03:48:18,290 --> 03:48:19,530
The bagels.
You go and.

4815
03:48:19,531 --> 03:48:20,460
No,
I'm not kidding.

4816
03:48:22,490 --> 03:48:24,780
Not kidding.
I'm not kidding.

4817
03:48:24,781 --> 03:48:26,940
I'm not kidding.
But then like five exclamation points.

4818
03:48:27,590 --> 03:48:28,150
I'll take that.

4819
03:48:28,150 --> 03:48:29,490
I'll take that.
I'm not kidding that.

4820
03:48:29,520 --> 03:48:30,860
That's.
But I'll take that.

4821
03:48:30,861 --> 03:48:32,330
I like it.
I like it.

4822
03:48:33,170 --> 03:48:35,420
Can you believe that shit?
Okay.

4823
03:48:35,480 --> 03:48:36,940
I'm not kidding.
Not kidding.

4824
03:48:37,240 --> 03:48:39,560
Party party at the end.
Alright,

4825
03:48:39,590 --> 03:48:39,951
wait,
wait,

4826
03:48:39,951 --> 03:48:40,784
wait.
But as soon as they would have cash to 

4827
03:48:41,740 --> 03:48:44,150
pay for it,
we're leaving a couple days before.

4828
03:48:46,490 --> 03:48:48,950
Oh my god.
They just leave it just like that.

4829
03:48:48,951 --> 03:48:51,560
That's perfect.
Hold up aesthetically.

4830
03:48:52,000 --> 03:48:55,550
That gave me on the side.
Should also be fucking mouth.

4831
03:48:55,551 --> 03:48:58,120
That's a perfect car.
The colors of the place.

4832
03:48:58,860 --> 03:48:59,930
It looks awesome,
dude.

4833
03:48:59,931 --> 03:49:01,310
It looks great.
Red and pink.

4834
03:49:01,840 --> 03:49:04,100
That's not pink.
It's beautiful.

4835
03:49:04,880 --> 03:49:07,730
It's white with pink stone.
All pink.

4836
03:49:08,420 --> 03:49:10,790
Blue would think.
Honestly,

4837
03:49:10,791 --> 03:49:12,230
I think it should be bright blue.
Perfect.

4838
03:49:12,260 --> 03:49:13,093
However we do whatever.
How about we give you a full pink wrap 

4839
03:49:15,650 --> 03:49:17,050
and then that's the cover.
No,

4840
03:49:17,150 --> 03:49:18,260
that's too much.
The bright blue.

4841
03:49:18,261 --> 03:49:20,240
I'll do the breakfast.
No,

4842
03:49:20,350 --> 03:49:20,740
no,
no.

4843
03:49:20,740 --> 03:49:23,940
That's some shit.
That's intentional.

4844
03:49:23,950 --> 03:49:27,500
We get you a hot pepper.
I later or a month.

4845
03:49:27,560 --> 03:49:28,850
What?
Hot pink camaro.

4846
03:49:29,070 --> 03:49:29,420
No,
no,

4847
03:49:29,420 --> 03:49:30,253
no.
Come on.

4848
03:49:30,330 --> 03:49:34,220
Someone's already done that.
I'm bringing up the amazing racist stuff

4849
03:49:34,221 --> 03:49:39,221
on the car to a website with.
Enjoy your previous.

4850
03:49:40,200 --> 03:49:41,990
I'd been amazing.
Grace is on the website.

4851
03:49:43,320 --> 03:49:44,690
No,
no one's going to google.

4852
03:49:44,691 --> 03:49:49,691
It was a different age.
Now says I'm the amazing racist.

4853
03:49:51,230 --> 03:49:56,230
It's a hot pink camaro in the back.
Says I'm not angelian not doing that.

4854
03:49:59,150 --> 03:50:01,700
Black or white as the wrap or we can go 
right after that,

4855
03:50:01,730 --> 03:50:03,860
but I just think it doesn't go as well.
No,

4856
03:50:03,861 --> 03:50:04,694
wait actually.
That way I won't get laid for the 

4857
03:50:08,610 --> 03:50:12,230
fucking month.
No ridiculous either.

4858
03:50:12,310 --> 03:50:16,220
How about you start wearing like an 
artificial fur coat and just go deep.

4859
03:50:16,460 --> 03:50:17,293
How about those yellow glasses that 
hunter s thompson used to wear all the 

4860
03:50:19,731 --> 03:50:21,950
time,
like aviators with yellow lenses.

4861
03:50:21,980 --> 03:50:22,813
I love.
How about that?

4862
03:50:22,850 --> 03:50:24,740
That's what I'm saying.
I'm saying let's go deep.

4863
03:50:25,490 --> 03:50:28,260
Let's take this to the next level.
How about you were like a little further

4864
03:50:28,270 --> 03:50:30,240
on you have to wear wardrobe wardrobes.
Every yoga class.

4865
03:50:32,370 --> 03:50:37,370
Yoga be fucking hard.
Your pants go.

4866
03:50:38,500 --> 03:50:39,333
Definitely wearing yoga pants,
press your cock right up against your 

4867
03:50:41,370 --> 03:50:42,990
side of your legs.
Everybody could say like,

4868
03:50:43,080 --> 03:50:44,450
jesus,
oh yeah,

4869
03:50:44,510 --> 03:50:45,343
I'll take pills beforehand.
Which you might actually help your 

4870
03:50:48,801 --> 03:50:53,801
performance performance enhancing drug.
Yeah.

4871
03:50:54,920 --> 03:50:56,080
Some sort of performance.
Yeah,

4872
03:50:56,090 --> 03:50:57,290
it does.
It's like it works,

4873
03:50:57,300 --> 03:50:59,540
uh,
to enhance your performance.

4874
03:50:59,541 --> 03:51:02,090
Certain athletic events banned certain 
events.

4875
03:51:03,100 --> 03:51:03,933
Like I feel like I said that,
but somebody told me it was wrong and I 

4876
03:51:07,731 --> 03:51:09,470
forgot.
Make sure that that's true.

4877
03:51:09,650 --> 03:51:12,200
like do they,
is viagra banned in the olympics?

4878
03:51:12,230 --> 03:51:13,063
I think I might have said this isn't 
really where he took a bunch of other 

4879
03:51:19,521 --> 03:51:21,920
shit in it.
I don't think that's true.

4880
03:51:22,070 --> 03:51:22,903
I think.
I think actually jeff dubitsky that saw 

4881
03:51:25,371 --> 03:51:27,150
the guy might've explained it to me.
That's not true.

4882
03:51:27,420 --> 03:51:28,570
So the stakes,
the stakes,

4883
03:51:28,930 --> 03:51:29,763
joe explained by agra is not currently 
listed as a band drug in the usada and 

4884
03:51:35,061 --> 03:51:35,610
sport or not.

4885
03:51:35,610 --> 03:51:36,710
I'm going to let you saw it.
okay.

4886
03:51:37,090 --> 03:51:37,960
Okay.
I'm wrong.

4887
03:51:38,130 --> 03:51:39,750
So if everyone does it,
if we do,

4888
03:51:39,751 --> 03:51:41,160
what if we don't do it?
What are the stakes here?

4889
03:51:41,190 --> 03:51:42,023
What's going on here?
Everyone who doesn't complete the whole 

4890
03:51:43,861 --> 03:51:48,300
challenge has to throw like what's,
what do we do?

4891
03:51:48,690 --> 03:51:51,010
Have grand five grand?
No,

4892
03:51:51,240 --> 03:51:52,860
not everyone's making.
No,

4893
03:51:52,861 --> 03:51:53,160
no,
no,

4894
03:51:53,160 --> 03:51:53,993
no.
Money.

4895
03:51:54,010 --> 03:51:55,860
Money.
I thought we were throwing a party party

4896
03:51:55,861 --> 03:51:56,694
party.
Well,

4897
03:51:56,910 --> 03:51:57,743
someone's got to pay for it.
Obviously the person doing it pay for 

4898
03:51:59,761 --> 03:52:00,690
it,
but I'd make it nice.

4899
03:52:01,120 --> 03:52:01,953
What about the money?
It's about what you've decided to do 

4900
03:52:03,301 --> 03:52:05,880
with it.
You got to live in a fucking dj.

4901
03:52:05,910 --> 03:52:08,370
Are you just trying to put up the party?
Are you going to have a party that would

4902
03:52:08,371 --> 03:52:11,020
be super annoying to go to.
No,

4903
03:52:11,410 --> 03:52:13,230
I don't want to make it fun for 
everybody else.

4904
03:52:13,940 --> 03:52:15,060
What kind of party would that be?

4905
03:52:15,720 --> 03:52:18,110
To stand up there?
Yeah,

4906
03:52:18,300 --> 03:52:22,400
you can.
Part of the bet they'll come.

4907
03:52:23,120 --> 03:52:27,330
You can invite them if you want to go in
a fucking heartbeat.

4908
03:52:27,860 --> 03:52:29,340
He's busy.
Go.

4909
03:52:29,500 --> 03:52:31,760
Doug would go.
He has told me,

4910
03:52:31,770 --> 03:52:35,300
and I quote,
I do not like bert kreischer fucking,

4911
03:52:35,310 --> 03:52:36,570
you know,
you're such a liar.

4912
03:52:36,571 --> 03:52:40,050
So diamonds raised.
I love this podcast.

4913
03:52:40,051 --> 03:52:45,051
Took a dark turn so we got to go do 
eight hours into this bitch straight.

4914
03:52:48,290 --> 03:52:52,850
So you have to wear a brace.
15 days of hot yoga,

4915
03:52:53,050 --> 03:52:54,660
of hot yoga,
wear a bracelet,

4916
03:52:54,690 --> 03:52:56,010
we'll figure it out.
This party thing,

4917
03:52:56,011 --> 03:52:59,710
we should throw like a really cool party
that we'd want to be at the event.

4918
03:52:59,880 --> 03:53:04,560
If there's somebody that does class 
clearly when there's obviously like some

4919
03:53:04,561 --> 03:53:08,220
spin that it's me that you're going to 
win a 100 percent,

4920
03:53:09,120 --> 03:53:11,730
98 percent,
you'll see,

4921
03:53:11,910 --> 03:53:12,900
well what are you going to win?

4922
03:53:12,960 --> 03:53:14,090
You're going to be the only one.
How would you,

4923
03:53:14,100 --> 03:53:15,120
when we,
if we all do it,

4924
03:53:15,150 --> 03:53:17,240
I think ari's going to tap out with 
yoga.

4925
03:53:17,400 --> 03:53:18,720
Probably true.
But this is the thing.

4926
03:53:18,721 --> 03:53:19,554
This is the thing.
Just a thought process that would allow 

4927
03:53:21,541 --> 03:53:24,810
you to jump ahead and say,
I'm going to win.

4928
03:53:25,030 --> 03:53:28,380
We don't even know what winning is.
That's why this is so ridiculous.

4929
03:53:28,530 --> 03:53:30,330
Like if winning,
if we both do it,

4930
03:53:30,360 --> 03:53:32,100
how are you going to beat me?
How you believe me?

4931
03:53:32,280 --> 03:53:34,080
I think they think you're going to.
Right.

4932
03:53:34,081 --> 03:53:36,950
So tell me how we both do it.
How do you.

4933
03:53:36,980 --> 03:53:37,813
When I,
I'm a mickey mouse doesn't make any 

4934
03:53:39,271 --> 03:53:43,720
sense.
I'm making a into this.

4935
03:53:43,820 --> 03:53:45,110
Going,
I can't go into this going,

4936
03:53:45,120 --> 03:53:47,640
I'm going to fail.
That was the option.

4937
03:53:47,890 --> 03:53:48,723
You said that you're going to win and 
how could you win and why would you be 

4938
03:53:50,551 --> 03:53:51,384
so quick to jump to the idea that you 
would win groomed carefully considering 

4939
03:53:55,051 --> 03:53:57,450
I believe I believe in winning.
I believe in winning.

4940
03:53:57,451 --> 03:53:57,841
Wow,
bro.

4941
03:53:57,841 --> 03:53:59,430
You're like America and you should be a 
bald eagle.

4942
03:53:59,490 --> 03:54:00,323
I'm a liTtle competitive and when this 
challenge starts to the fucking 

4943
03:54:03,391 --> 03:54:04,081
committed,
no way.

4944
03:54:04,081 --> 03:54:06,640
I'm going to let me tell.
Let me tell you,

4945
03:54:06,710 --> 03:54:09,600
I will not lose.
I will not lose.

4946
03:54:09,930 --> 03:54:10,890
Wow.
That's amazing.

4947
03:54:11,520 --> 03:54:12,850
Before.
Yes.

4948
03:54:12,960 --> 03:54:15,660
What happened?
The last weird.

4949
03:54:16,260 --> 03:54:17,460
For one,
we should believe him.

4950
03:54:17,550 --> 03:54:19,980
It doesn't make any sense.
His records pictures really use.

4951
03:54:20,020 --> 03:54:22,500
I mean I hear what he's saying and I 
want to just believe him

4952
03:54:23,980 --> 03:54:25,770
what's wrong?
But I mean you tell me what,

4953
03:54:25,820 --> 03:54:29,650
what am I?
My scrollable my goal to go run 20 miles

4954
03:54:29,820 --> 03:54:31,750
screaming.
I feel like he could do a marathon.

4955
03:54:31,880 --> 03:54:33,800
easy,
easy peasy.

4956
03:54:34,440 --> 03:54:35,660
Further,
I think you did.

4957
03:54:37,570 --> 03:54:38,403
Yeah,
and I feel like he's quit drinking for 

4958
03:54:39,791 --> 03:54:41,770
many,
many days numerous times,

4959
03:54:45,570 --> 03:54:50,570
but I feel like other alcoholics is 
going to be fuck used girl rogan.

4960
03:54:52,060 --> 03:54:55,840
You fucking assholes are ganging up on 
her friend when he needs you most.

4961
03:54:55,960 --> 03:55:00,960
What he needs you to do is validate all 
of his exaggerations bullshit stories.

4962
03:55:01,330 --> 03:55:02,290
Hyperbole.
What if.

4963
03:55:03,170 --> 03:55:04,850
What if we all do it?
I'll do it.

4964
03:55:04,960 --> 03:55:08,200
What are the stakes or if none of us do 
it,

4965
03:55:08,260 --> 03:55:10,680
we can continue that.
We can continue to be a trip.

4966
03:55:10,690 --> 03:55:11,523
It should be a trip.
A trip because that's what we did Last 

4967
03:55:14,230 --> 03:55:15,063
time.
I think the party though is like it's 

4968
03:55:15,641 --> 03:55:20,410
different and it has to do with all our 
friends.

4969
03:55:20,411 --> 03:55:21,690
Taking that off comedy.
It's fun,

4970
03:55:21,691 --> 03:55:26,280
man.
Just do a real party bar music.

4971
03:55:26,700 --> 03:55:29,560
It's just a cool band tHat wants to play
for us.

4972
03:55:29,561 --> 03:55:30,394
That sounds fun.

4973
03:55:32,930 --> 03:55:34,360
Time.
So we're all great.

4974
03:55:34,660 --> 03:55:38,140
The entire month of october.
It's done sober.

4975
03:55:38,170 --> 03:55:39,930
October 15.
Hot yoga.

4976
03:55:39,940 --> 03:55:41,860
October.
You get paid twice?

4977
03:55:42,190 --> 03:55:42,581
No,

4978
03:55:42,581 --> 03:55:43,870
no ip.
When they have to pay,

4979
03:55:43,871 --> 03:55:46,230
i'Ll come right back here.
You have to pee sessions for the whole.

4980
03:55:46,480 --> 03:55:47,060
No,
no,

4981
03:55:47,060 --> 03:55:48,050
no.
You're making me look,

4982
03:55:49,120 --> 03:55:49,953
I will try not to pee,
pee and come right back in or provided 

4983
03:55:53,131 --> 03:55:54,640
me a safe scenario where I compete in 
the.

4984
03:55:54,820 --> 03:55:57,220
In the room.
We'll figure it out on the curtain.

4985
03:55:57,760 --> 03:56:01,330
So hot yoga?
No booze sober october.

4986
03:56:01,410 --> 03:56:02,350
yes.
There's our website.

4987
03:56:02,351 --> 03:56:04,390
We've got it sober.
Bert bert,

4988
03:56:04,391 --> 03:56:05,141

No,

4989
03:56:05,141 --> 03:56:06,970
so october,
october.

4990
03:56:07,420 --> 03:56:08,253
He lost him.
Somebody grabbed it while we were doing 

4991
03:56:09,191 --> 03:56:10,024
it.
I was trying to check out and someone 

4992
03:56:10,601 --> 03:56:11,434
got it on other weapons.
Can you just please once you get 

4993
03:56:14,771 --> 03:56:19,020
solicited for that?
Fuck that schedule.

4994
03:56:19,060 --> 03:56:21,390
I still give it to him.
Might not on it.

4995
03:56:21,440 --> 03:56:24,650
It might be some person who's like a 
industrial.

4996
03:56:25,420 --> 03:56:26,240
No,
no,

4997
03:56:26,240 --> 03:56:26,641

no.
It.

5001
03:56:29,310 --> 03:56:32,460
I think the good side.
Obviously if you listen to podcasts,

5002
03:56:32,530 --> 03:56:33,363
you know,
why would they buy it if they need to 

5003
03:56:34,630 --> 03:56:35,463
make sure that no one else got it.
IT could be that maybe they didn't 

5004
03:56:36,911 --> 03:56:37,631
realize that.
I'd be like,

5005
03:56:37,631 --> 03:56:38,630

5006
03:56:38,700 --> 03:56:42,320
take a bus to give me the $12 for it 
doesn't need to do it.

5007
03:56:42,630 --> 03:56:45,040
Do it all through social media.
We can do it another place where we have

5008
03:56:45,041 --> 03:56:47,830

5040
03:58:21,260 --> 03:58:24,010
Wilbur's on my shortlist for filming my 
new netflix special.

5041
03:58:24,080 --> 03:58:26,230
Really wish I said netflix clearer.

5042
03:58:28,700 --> 03:58:29,533
Really?
Yeah.

5043
03:58:29,750 --> 03:58:30,583
Yeah.
The wilbur is on a drunk fat 

5044
03:58:31,411 --> 03:58:32,660
fatberg.com.
Do we have it?

5045
03:58:32,690 --> 03:58:34,040
We haven't,
we haven't.

5046
03:58:34,070 --> 03:58:36,330
We got it.
We got it.

5047
03:58:36,500 --> 03:58:37,333
Wow.
We're going to build that shit as a 

5048
03:58:38,691 --> 03:58:40,940
short list for what to do.
My netflix special,

5049
03:58:40,941 --> 03:58:41,860
it's going to be,
um,

5050
03:58:41,900 --> 03:58:44,060
my shortlist is austin,
uh,

5051
03:58:44,061 --> 03:58:46,820
at cap city comedy club,
boston.

5052
03:58:46,821 --> 03:58:47,654
The wilbur,
and I'm thinking a couple of other 

5053
03:58:49,761 --> 03:58:51,140
places,
a couple of small places,

5054
03:58:51,200 --> 03:58:52,033
but those are the two places I'm 
thinking leaning more towards comedy 

5055
03:58:53,841 --> 03:58:54,674
club,
but the wilbur is like three comedy 

5056
03:58:55,971 --> 03:58:59,030
clubs stacked on top of each other.
The wilbur is like very deep,

5057
03:58:59,270 --> 03:59:01,730
are very shallow,
rather it's only 300 seats,

5058
03:59:02,030 --> 03:59:04,090
three floors of 300 seats of.
Yeah.

5059
03:59:04,160 --> 03:59:05,690
It's great.
You've never done it.

5060
03:59:06,200 --> 03:59:09,350
I've done shit for.
Oh,

5061
03:59:09,370 --> 03:59:12,830
it's fogged when doing the wilbur into 
january.

5062
03:59:13,010 --> 03:59:13,843
I might go with you.
I might go with you just to see what 

5063
03:59:15,351 --> 03:59:16,184
it's like to watch a set there feeling 
good because I have to make a decision 

5064
03:59:19,130 --> 03:59:21,800
somewhere around january is when I 
wanted to make the decision where I want

5065
03:59:21,801 --> 03:59:22,550
to be.

5066
03:59:22,550 --> 03:59:25,130
I will say if you do it at a club,
keep me in mind.

5067
03:59:25,380 --> 03:59:27,620
Okay.
I'm doing my specialist,

5068
03:59:27,640 --> 03:59:31,010
the trocadero.
Trocadero philadelphia.

5069
03:59:31,520 --> 03:59:33,460
Oh,
the trocadero theatre and places.

5070
03:59:33,960 --> 03:59:34,793
It's got a lot of lIke.
Tom and I had a great conversation when 

5071
03:59:38,691 --> 03:59:39,850
you did the truck.
Yeah.

5072
03:59:40,100 --> 03:59:42,530
People said tom couldn't sell a ticket 
and then he sold.

5073
03:59:43,920 --> 03:59:46,350
No,
I did I think four or five.

5074
03:59:46,800 --> 03:59:48,020
Five.
I think.

5075
03:59:48,021 --> 03:59:49,750
Five shows of the truck.
Oh,

5076
03:59:49,910 --> 03:59:52,150
philly's an epic comedy city.
It's fucking amazing.

5077
03:59:52,190 --> 03:59:54,660
Epic commentary to five shows the 
tropical,

5078
03:59:54,670 --> 03:59:57,170
I think it was four or five.
I don't remember whose five.

5079
03:59:57,380 --> 03:59:58,920
Trust me.
I know your story better than you do.

5080
04:00:00,240 --> 04:00:01,190
It's impressive,
man.

5081
04:00:01,460 --> 04:00:03,470
They have helium.
It's one of the best in the country.

5082
04:00:03,490 --> 04:00:04,880
That's great.
Clips on the spot.

5083
04:00:04,910 --> 04:00:07,400
Thinking of going in and out,
but maybe that's another spot we can do.

5084
04:00:07,410 --> 04:00:09,110
Especially you.
Especially helium.

5085
04:00:09,590 --> 04:00:13,170
That could be real helium so hard with 
paramount.

5086
04:00:13,280 --> 04:00:15,910
It can be the cameras that there's no 
seats.

5087
04:00:15,920 --> 04:00:19,160
You have to lose in such a tight space.
Do you though with today,

5088
04:00:19,170 --> 04:00:20,280
with what they can do today

5089
04:00:20,280 --> 04:00:21,520
with cameras,
you know,

5090
04:00:21,530 --> 04:00:25,800
if you could really like put a lot of 
small cameras up on the wall,

5091
04:00:25,860 --> 04:00:26,693
mounted on the wall,
get all your footage and then decide 

5092
04:00:29,251 --> 04:00:30,084
what you pick and the only reason why 
you would move from the center shot is 

5093
04:00:33,511 --> 04:00:36,300
if someone gets in front of it and then 
you have to really strongly.

5094
04:00:36,301 --> 04:00:38,270
Yeah,
this is what real problem.

5095
04:00:38,290 --> 04:00:40,410
You can spend,
let's say four or $500,000.

5096
04:00:40,580 --> 04:00:41,550
What?
Hold on.

5097
04:00:41,551 --> 04:00:44,420
Hold on.
Let me bounce.

5098
04:00:44,430 --> 04:00:46,560
This is my feeling on,
on standup,

5099
04:00:46,590 --> 04:00:48,350
on television.
Now as a stance,

5100
04:00:48,351 --> 04:00:49,184
I feel like when you're watching someone
in the audience are sitting there and 

5101
04:00:52,081 --> 04:00:52,914
you're watching them,
you're seeing them like from the waist 

5102
04:00:54,331 --> 04:00:55,080
up,
right,

5103
04:00:55,080 --> 04:00:57,030
or close to it at the store,
something like that,

5104
04:00:57,031 --> 04:00:59,300
which is a perfect environment at the 
ice house,

5105
04:00:59,340 --> 04:01:00,810
same deal,
perfect environment.

5106
04:01:01,230 --> 04:01:02,370
ThAt's how you should watch it at home.

5107
04:01:02,430 --> 04:01:04,470
You actually watch it flat on with no 
edits.

5108
04:01:04,620 --> 04:01:05,453
The only time I think you should ever so
side to side as if you have to edit 

5109
04:01:07,321 --> 04:01:08,154
something or if someone's doing 
something that's odd because we want to 

5110
04:01:10,441 --> 04:01:13,100
see from a does it.
It doesn't get boring and I watched.

5111
04:01:13,700 --> 04:01:15,540
It doesn't get boring when I was doing 
watch.

5112
04:01:15,660 --> 04:01:16,380
Stand up.
You're.

5113
04:01:16,380 --> 04:01:19,140
You're automatically on its own shifts 
back and forth.

5114
04:01:19,350 --> 04:01:22,050
You get to choose what you're saying.
You look over the piano guy,

5115
04:01:22,530 --> 04:01:24,540
you're not looking straight on at the 
stage the whole time.

5116
04:01:25,110 --> 04:01:28,530
As long as what they're saying is funny 
and it's good and they're locked into it

5117
04:01:29,100 --> 04:01:29,933
and do it.
I don't think that's the best way to do 

5118
04:01:31,141 --> 04:01:33,540
it because you knew you're conscious of 
the fact that changing angles.

5119
04:01:33,870 --> 04:01:36,060
Why does that enhance the bit?
I don't think it does.

5120
04:01:36,290 --> 04:01:39,000
I thought that it does because they do 
that with everything else,

5121
04:01:39,001 --> 04:01:40,980
like music videos,
rock and roll,

5122
04:01:40,981 --> 04:01:41,814
concerts.

5123
04:01:41,880 --> 04:01:42,713
Anything that people do,
they go at it from different angles 

5124
04:01:43,921 --> 04:01:45,540
because it.
It'll sort of stimulate your mind,

5125
04:01:45,780 --> 04:01:47,910
but I don't think if you went to see a 
standup comic,

5126
04:01:48,110 --> 04:01:51,870
you go see joey d as in dog or you're 
watching them head on and it's perfect.

5127
04:01:51,871 --> 04:01:55,260
Sometimes you're looking at his waist.
Sometimes you're looking at his belly in

5128
04:01:55,320 --> 04:01:56,250
his eyes.
You can do that.

5129
04:01:56,251 --> 04:01:57,084
When you watched him from the waist up.
You can do that if you're watching them 

5130
04:01:59,011 --> 04:02:01,250
from where the head of the eu arguing 
that you should tell him.

5131
04:02:01,590 --> 04:02:03,600
I think you should have different 
angles.

5132
04:02:03,750 --> 04:02:05,070
Someone wants different angles.

5133
04:02:06,790 --> 04:02:11,790
I just pay for this myself and I can 
tell you from me going like,

5134
04:02:13,061 --> 04:02:15,670
I've been on tv for awhile and I know 
what I'm doing.

5135
04:02:16,180 --> 04:02:19,000
I still got a plethora of cameras,
including a jib.

5136
04:02:19,360 --> 04:02:21,100
Even for some time.
you don't want a job.

5137
04:02:21,101 --> 04:02:24,130
I bought it already.
I already paid plans around like a drone

5138
04:02:24,910 --> 04:02:28,190
at the comedy works.
I couldn't do it,

5139
04:02:28,680 --> 04:02:33,680
bro.
Manage on pilot,

5140
04:02:35,261 --> 04:02:36,760
but you're good.
I'm super serious.

5141
04:02:38,290 --> 04:02:41,680
Super serious.
Super serious,

5142
04:02:42,430 --> 04:02:43,910
super serious.
Fuck all of you.

5143
04:02:44,850 --> 04:02:46,940
how that.
I'll be a drone.

5144
