1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,600
Some guys go into acting,

3
00:00:03,601 --> 00:00:06,780
you know Gina Gershon is
like a famous actress now.

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:07,883
Gina Gershon.

5
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:08,620
Gina.

6
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,151
Goddammit it.

7
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:09,984
What's her name?

8
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:10,973
Gina Carano.

9
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,660
Gina Gershon's,

10
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,980
obviously a famous actress too.

11
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,183
Um,

12
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,890
there was another rumor
that Clinton fucked her too.

13
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:21,770
That's why it was good fallen all this
little g's went and fucked everybody love

14
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,280
him.

15
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:22,731
The last,

16
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,090
the last American presidential,

17
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,200
Dick's Leaner Ladies and gentlemen,

18
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,610
dude was they say he's smashed out.

19
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:29,300
Liz Hurley.

20
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:29,790
Yeah.

21
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,140
Yeah.

22
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,730
This is a picture of
them stare at each other.

23
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,500
Look in each other's eyes and you look,

24
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:34,790
oh yeah,

25
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,200
for sure.

26
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,180
It's just too romantic.

27
00:00:38,181 --> 00:00:38,790
The look,

28
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,270
the them looking at each
other and it wasn't at times.

29
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,260
Tom Sizemore.

30
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:43,400
That was dry snitching.

31
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:43,971
He was,

32
00:00:43,971 --> 00:00:44,480
yes.

33
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,940
He was a dry snitch up
that dirty son of a bitch.

34
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,870
That Nigga is a snitch.

35
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:48,530
He is.

36
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,191
That's what I said.

37
00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:50,600
That's the first thing I said on the Fred.

38
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,080
I said,

39
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,290
what this tells me is that Tom Sizemore
can't keep the fucking secret dude.

40
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:55,771
Yeah,

41
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:56,604
that's weak.

42
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,270
I told Mary and you go on
throw bill under the bus.

43
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,133
There's a picture.

44
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,190
Come on,

45
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,083
son.

46
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,470
Look in his eyes.

47
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,970
No one escapes that deck.

48
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:08,610
That deck is takes an octopus,

49
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,800
comes out and grabs everything.

50
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,500
Looking at him.

51
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,090
I mean that is like a
dominant submissive picture.

52
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:17,040
If ever people were not touching,

53
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,320
but one was encroaching
Ludas body language.

54
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:20,640
He's leaning towards her.

55
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,600
Look at her.

56
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,890
Look at her left shoulder.

57
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:24,570
Turn slightly away from him.

58
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,190
She wants to lay down right now.

59
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,900
Look at her list.

60
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:28,471
Oh,

61
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:29,304
dirty.

62
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,143
Too dirty.

63
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:30,541
Dirty,

64
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:31,440
dirty people.

65
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,340
I love it.

66
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,173
I wish I was there.

67
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,080
I'd beat off in the corner.

68
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:34,914
I wouldn't say it

69
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,761
slick willy.

70
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:39,594
Tearing it up.

71
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,980
I don't know how we got on that subject.

72
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:45,000
We were talking about Mike Tyson.

73
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:46,420
Beat the fuck out of people.

74
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,250
Just rude.

75
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:51,751
Tremendous.

76
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:53,790
You'll need to fuck up the picture
and we're putting Hillary in there.

77
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,450
Get that picture down.

78
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,230
You don't need to fuck
up all of our minds.

79
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:00,930
But thinking about the guilt that he
must have suffered right after he nutted

80
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,120
non worth it.

81
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,953
Shit.

82
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,460
Oh Kiss.

83
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:06,390
I mean she knows.

84
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:07,224
She knows

85
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,550
she,

86
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,383
you

87
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,700
look at her fuck.

88
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,640
Oh my God.

89
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:15,540
Look at that woman.

90
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,740
Oh Wow.

91
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,420
They play dress up.

92
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:24,930
Look,

93
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,220
Paul Revere's right behind
them to get that woman.

94
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,780
That woman's a hater.

95
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,081
No,

96
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:31,914
the woman right there,

97
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,910
you get up to her.

98
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:33,450
Look at that.

99
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,171
She knows.

100
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:36,120
She knows is the classic.

101
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,320
She's either face.

102
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:38,220
She got the Dick.

103
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:38,820
I did it.

104
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,390
She does what's going on under the table.

105
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,640
As soon as they got in their car,

106
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:45,331
her and her husband,

107
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,520
she was like that motherfucker.

108
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,480
Did you see the way he
kissed Elizabeth Hurley?

109
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:48,991
Oh,

110
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:49,824
he's such a pig.

111
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,930
I despise him rush.

112
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:52,800
Limbaugh's right.

113
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,173
Look at him.

114
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:55,801
You know what's funny though,

115
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:56,100
when I,

116
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:56,910
when I heard about this,

117
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,270
it was so interesting that I heard
conservatives come out the woodwork.

118
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,410
Um,

119
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:02,921
who was it?

120
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:04,600
I think it was rand Paul was like,

121
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,021
Oh man,

122
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:05,950
this is terrible.

123
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,420
The president should apologize,

124
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,650
but wait a minute homie.

125
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,160
Where were you when Newt
Gingrich was running for office?

126
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,880
Because didn't he drop his wife and then
deal with another woman and then deal

127
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:16,714
with another one?

128
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,800
Isn't that,

129
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,070
that,

130
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,903
that the,

131
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,010
the benchmark of men that are in power,

132
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,330
they're just looking to play.

133
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:22,870
Gotcha.

134
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,681
All these shit heads.

135
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:27,660
Are they just using that like it's points
on a blanket and nobody ever fucked?

136
00:03:27,661 --> 00:03:28,000
No,

137
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,990
they scored on you.

138
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:29,591
They caught you,

139
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:30,341
they scored on you.

140
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:33,820
They got points now and they just can
use those points to try to shut you down

141
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:34,654
and build them up.

142
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,390
But it all just makes everybody
look like a bunch of bitches.

143
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,850
Because if that was going
on amongst your friends,

144
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:42,850
let's say if there was 10 of your
friends and one of your friends was not

145
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:44,890
particularly happy with
his wife's relationship,

146
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,570
and so he started banging Elizabeth Hurley
and all you guys found out about it,

147
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:54,010
I wouldn't dry snitch if he would play
Tom Sizemore I'll tell you went out and

148
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:54,250
you,

149
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,083
you snitch.

150
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,680
No one would want to hang
out with you anymore.

151
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:57,341
He'd be like,

152
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:58,570
what the fuck tech?

153
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,560
But come on man.

154
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:01,240
Who's going to party
with Tom Sizemore now?

155
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,841
Not me.

156
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:02,890
I'll tell you that Tom.

157
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,150
Go Fuck yourself pal.

158
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,590
[inaudible] keep a motherfucker.

159
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:16,430
Okay.
