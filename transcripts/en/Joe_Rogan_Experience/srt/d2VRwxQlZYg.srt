1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,930
Wow,
on your phase three or the ID?

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,920
Every picture has her id.
You could get fucking busted.

3
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:14,250
Are we going right when you're talking 
about child pornography?

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,150
Dude,
we're live.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,070
Eddie Bravo.
How dare you.

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,870
That shit with standup.
Eddie Bravo.

7
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:21,780
How dare you bring up shit that we're 
talking about off the air.

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,060
Okay.
I'm saying start the fucking podcast off

9
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:25,830
with that.
It's my cousin.

10
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:27,210
Anyway,

You know what?
I love the song back.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,190
I did that.
Uh,

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,630
weapons of destruction.
Is that what it's called?

21
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,800
Yes.
Yeah.

22
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:58,020
The one with a Christopher?
No.

23
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,380
Christopher walken.
And did the video is dancing fucking bad

24
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:03,110
ass video.
All his videos are all.

25
00:01:03,111 --> 00:01:04,540
His music is pretty good.
I've,

26
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,620
I've really never really got into them,
but that one really grabbing or our 

27
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:09,620
guests as always.
My Buddy,

28
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,390
Mr Eddie Bravo,
Bravo,

29
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,400
the 10th planet.
Jiu Jitsu Jujitsu of um,

30
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,480
you can go to twitter.com/Eddie
Bravo.

31
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,850
And um,

32
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:25,010
where else can they get your shit?
You still have a myspace page up with 

33
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:25,010
all your music,
right?

34
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,760
Yeah,
but then move that to another site 

35
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:28,760
eventually.
Man.

36
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
I'm like behind on every fucking thing,
man.

37
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:31,860
I got to put out the mastering the 
twister DVD.

38
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:33,990
I did.
I'm so behind on everything,

39
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,370
like musicians are still using my space.
Some of them,

40
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:39,630
right,
because it's convenient.

41
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:44,770
Yeah,
it's got that music player that you 

42
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:44,770
could see your,
uh,

43
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,010
your views or your hits.
That's pretty important to music.

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,040
That's super important.
If you have thousands of hits on one of 

45
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,440
your songs,
people are gonna go,

46
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,700
Oh shit,
let me check that out.

47
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,610
If there's four hits,
paper just going to bypass.

48
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,920
Right?
And when you embed a video,

49
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:01,440
you can embed it with the number of hits
in.

50
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:05,280
It can't show.
That must be something new.

51
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:10,281
I don't know about that.
I mean if you embed like a youtube clip 

52
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:11,540
or you see as the window,
you don't see how many videos are,

53
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,380
how many people have watched this for,
you know,

54
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,500
but that would be a good feature I 
think.

55
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:19,050
But no one goes on my space anymore,
you know,

56
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,850
I'm always on my website.
10 Planet j Dot j Dot Com.

57
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,750
I'm on that motherfucker like,
you know,

58
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:27,450
like Joe on twitter and shit all day.

59
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,790
Okay.
So if they want to see your music 

60
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,460
though,
they could still go to myspace.com/the

61
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:38,210
twister.
Those are all old videos and shit.

62
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,830
They're like three or four years now.
Old.

63
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:42,480
So.
But they're still bad ass.

64
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,120
Brian,
what are you doing over there,

65
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:46,350
buddy?
Just fine.

66
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:48,120
Tweaking the audio.
Fine.

67
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:51,540
Tweaking.
Find does become quite a podcast mogul.

68
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,540
He's been broadcasting,
not just this podcast,

69
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:59,541
but the uh,
the unfortunate brody Stevens projects 

70
00:02:59,541 --> 00:02:59,541
that was.
Did you watch any of that?

71
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,080
What,
what,

72
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,740
what was your going and call it that?
The unfortunate brody's project.

73
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,500
It looks like he's going crazy.
Yeah.

74
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:11,920
Then that way he's allowed to get crazy.
I just think I need a taser though,

75
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,400
you know?
I think if we do that,

76
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,260
it's a character character.
Just it's like,

77
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,420
I think it works great for standup 
comedy,

78
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:21,330
but I think for a podcast,
I don't know,

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,030
it was hard because I felt bad for the 
last episode.

80
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:30,031
He brought his roommate on again,
any screamed at his roommate the whole 

81
00:03:30,031 --> 00:03:33,550
time to the point where his roommate I 
saw look like close to him and his cheek

82
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:38,551
was twitching because he was so upset 
and then I went outside because I was 

83
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:43,651
freaking out.
I went outside and he comes running 

84
00:03:43,651 --> 00:03:46,411
outside and goes like in the middle of 
an interview he just took off and brody 

85
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:46,630
was just left there on the couch going,
oh well,

86
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,890
you know,
I don't know what he was doing,

87
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,450
but the guy who's like,
I can't take this anymore.

88
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,800
I don't know what to do.
I can't take this anymore.

89
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,930
And like he was like,
he just got raped.

90
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,980
That's what,
that's what,

91
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:59,010
that's what the conversation was and 
that's when it came to the conclusion 

92
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,340
that what happened is,
is that they act together.

93
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,440
Him,
brody Stevens in his roommate act 

94
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,411
together,
like if a couple were to break up and 

95
00:04:07,411 --> 00:04:07,411
they had to live together for like three
months,

96
00:04:07,411 --> 00:04:07,700
you know,
like that,

97
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,010
that anger kind of that and it just,
I don't know,

98
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:12,780
man.
It freaked me out.

99
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:13,170
Real

100
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,370
fucking anger to money ever been around 
someone when they,

101
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:20,371
they,
they're breaking up but they still 

102
00:04:20,371 --> 00:04:20,371
haven't moved out yet and then the chick
start seeing another dude.

103
00:04:20,371 --> 00:04:24,831
Then they have complications or the guy 
starts seem the check that that would 

104
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:29,850
never happen.
I would never put myself to that.

105
00:04:29,851 --> 00:04:32,730
I mean you have to be a brokester and 
understand or some kind of.

106
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,310
I don't know what's going on with the 
lease or something.

107
00:04:35,311 --> 00:04:36,900
Maybe there's like a problem.
They're both on.

108
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,750
People just love drama.
They never figured it out.

109
00:04:39,751 --> 00:04:42,740
They never figured out how to be cool 
with each other from the moment of their

110
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:43,910
relationship,
but just a,

111
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,170
it's an eventual explosion.
It's like,

112
00:04:46,171 --> 00:04:48,300
how,
how fucked up is enough to get before it

113
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:51,780
all falls was the only way I could 
understand a situation like that is girl

114
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:55,020
breaks up with boy,
boy is begging for girl back.

115
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,190
Girl goes,
you know what,

116
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,220
we're not getting back together,
but I'm fucking staying here for two 

117
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:01,220
more months because I paid the rent and 
boys like,

118
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,050
fuck it,
stay in it.

119
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,180
It's like it's going to give them more 
time to maybe change your mind.

120
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,750
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

121
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,690
I could kind of see that when I broke 
up.

122
00:05:09,691 --> 00:05:12,780
I lived with a chick a long time ago.
The first time I've ever lived with very

123
00:05:12,781 --> 00:05:14,400
nice girl,
but we were both kids.

124
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,600
You know,
I was 21,

125
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,160
she was 20.
We were both retarded.

126
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,550
Right.
And uh,

127
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,240
when,
when I lived with her and we broke up,

128
00:05:21,241 --> 00:05:26,241
there was a period of time,
like for like two weeks we were still 

129
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:28,260
together and she was still like staying 
in my house,

130
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,690
but we were,
we were not together anymore.

131
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,730
We'd broken up.
So she had started dating other dudes 

132
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:35,730
and I'd start dating other checks and 
you know,

133
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:40,470
she'd be cool with it and then she would
tell me about dudes and I wouldn't get 

134
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:40,470
jealous,
but I would tell her about a chicken.

135
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,370
She get mad at me within two weeks.
She's 20 years old,

136
00:05:44,371 --> 00:05:45,360
man.
Twelve years old.

137
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:50,361
You're retarded.
You don't know what the fuck's going on 

138
00:05:50,361 --> 00:05:50,361
in love with her?
No,

139
00:05:50,361 --> 00:05:50,520
no,
no.

140
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,350
Definitely not because I didn't freak 
out when she left,

141
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:57,120
although I did try to get her back on.
I came off like a huge.

142
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:57,980
I

143
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,440
don't know if you've ever done that 
before.

144
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:04,630
When you get devastated by a check and 
then you try to figure out a way to 

145
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:04,760
bring a bag.
It's almost like an ego thing really.

146
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:07,190
It's like the relationship was boring.
Did she break over there?

147
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:07,730
Yeah.
Yeah.

148
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:13,530
That hurts now.
How long were you guys living together 

149
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:13,530
before?
Not that long,

150
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,180
man.
I did not last very long.

151
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,310
It was a disaster.
Six months maybe.

152
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:18,010
Something like that.
That's not enough.

153
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,200
You can get deep and six maybe not even.
I'm not going to think it was six 

154
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,200
months.
She was a nice kid.

155
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,641
We were just young and stupid and.
But she started banging other dudes and 

156
00:06:27,641 --> 00:06:27,830
I started banging on the trucks and it 
was,

157
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,550
it was real weird because we're living 
together and every now and then like she

158
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:32,960
would get horny and I'd fuck her anyway.

159
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,610
It would be.
It was very strange.

160
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:37,040
It was like a retard retard 
relationship.

161
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:42,041
Shit.
Like the shit you do when you're 21 

162
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,410
usually.
Generally when someone breaks up the 

163
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,650
girl generally for most people the girl 
has so much more power than the guy.

164
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:53,770
The girl can bank 10 dudes that day they
broke up like the guy like the guy might

165
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,780
not be able to get laid for a couple of 
weeks.

166
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,760
He hasn't been in the game for awhile 
and that's the reason why they're 

167
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:03,760
breaking up was because the guy found 
someone to already.

168
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,500
That's true.
That's track tracking.

169
00:07:05,501 --> 00:07:08,360
Boston marijuana lived.
It was way harder to meet people.

170
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,160
This is not the same place,
man.

171
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:15,161
People are not nearly as friendly.
It's not nearly as easy to go out and 

172
00:07:15,161 --> 00:07:15,530
meet people or going to a bar or club or
whatever.

173
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,430
It's a fucking grind.
It's not easy and everyone's in jackets.

174
00:07:19,431 --> 00:07:20,920
He really don't know what the fuck 
you're getting.

175
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,270
You don't know what you're getting here 
to look at girls jeans,

176
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,360
how vacuum sealed or these fucking 
things like clubs,

177
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:34,390
even clubs you really can't tell,
so some girls can cover their fucked up 

178
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,260
shit.
When you get them naked,

179
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:37,400
you're like,
Whoa,

180
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,930
fuck.
They confuse you.

181
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,410
If you go into a club there,
they got glow sticks,

182
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:47,120
they got glitter,
they got fake fake.

183
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,080
It's dark and they got so much fucking 
makeup on and the covering the ship 

184
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,380
strategically,
they know how to cover them.

185
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:57,470
Rolls Up.
How crazy is the idea of dollar club?

186
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,260
How close crazies the idea of a 
nightclub,

187
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,440
he go to a place.
It's a designated meeting area where 

188
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,110
everybody goes that supposedly is single
and wants to fuck.

189
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:06,860
You know?
It's like,

190
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,050
can you get it?
That's the big question.

191
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:10,680
Can you meet?
Can you meet somebody?

192
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,980
Are you compatible?
Do you get it?

193
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,880
But we're going to provide you with 
music,

194
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:16,250
so you get to move around and grind 
against each other.

195
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,800
We're going to give you drink so you 
make shitty decisions.

196
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,040
We're going to set you up in a place 
where it's probably going to be people 

197
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,040
that are selling drugs.

198
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,040
If you were going to do something more 
fucked up,

199
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,470
it's all together in one big spot and we
stay open until 2:00

200
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:28,970
in the morning.
That's one place.

201
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:33,971
I never pick up chicks that though I 
never pick up chicks at the dance club 

202
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:34,700
because if I'm dancing it's an acting a 
fool.

203
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:37,250
I'm not like taking it serious,
like breaking it down.

204
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:38,990
You know what?
I was totally the opposite.

205
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:42,440
Like for me,
I swear for me when I was like 21,

206
00:08:42,441 --> 00:08:45,770
22,
the way I would make moves on a check is

207
00:08:45,771 --> 00:08:49,190
I would find the best dancer and then 
dance with her and I always thought like

208
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:54,191
I could just,
I could get them with the dancing man.

209
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,070
I

210
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:01,070
was dancing before I could even walk.
My aunts would just hold me out because 

211
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,510
my ad to answer a couple of years older 
than me and they were just holding me up

212
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,710
and everyone will be dancing like 
fucking fools all the time.

213
00:09:06,711 --> 00:09:08,520
So you still dance?
I went to school dances.

214
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:11,100
I was always dancing.
Do you still dance one once in a while.

215
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,230
If I'm at a club and they're playing 
some good shit,

216
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,900
you know,
some good fit is sam or something.

217
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:18,900
Some new ludicrous or something.
I'll be dancing.

218
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,150
Got To be good though.
Oh sure.

219
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,250
That's wake the fuck up.
No,

220
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,610
you know what that is?
That's an alarm.

221
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,940
Call Your Business Manager.
Check on your funds.

222
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:36,360
Like everyday it goes up.
Keep keep that shit going every day.

223
00:09:36,361 --> 00:09:40,020
But I usually wake up reminder to check 
your fucking money.

224
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:41,280
Dude.
Slow down.

225
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,910
What are you spending too much money?
I don't keep track of it.

226
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:45,900
Yeah,
that's my problem.

227
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:47,250
You know when they get a business 
manager,

228
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:49,170
I don't have to keep that.
I'd like,

229
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,180
you know,
I always envied you man.

230
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:54,870
How many years did we know each other?
And you had a business manager and I had

231
00:09:54,871 --> 00:09:56,940
a handle all my shit and do all my 
taxes.

232
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,390
You never worried about shit since I've 
known you.

233
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,850
You just have a credit card and you 
don't worry about shit.

234
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,670
I remember a couple of times you told me
go man,

235
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,980
I could have 2 million in the bank.

236
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,210
Um,
I didn't want to disclose that.

237
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:12,980
Okay.
Okay.

238
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,030
So anyways,
he brought the comic books.

239
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,510
Have you,
did you grow up liking comic books?

240
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,980
Um,
no.

241
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,610
I never read comic books,
man.

242
00:10:24,611 --> 00:10:25,950
It wasn't into it.
I was,

243
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,710
I hated.
I hated superheroes,

244
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,680
man.
I wasn't into him.

245
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:33,730
I was spiderman for Halloween and it's 
so weird playing the role of like a 

246
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,320
superhero at a party,
like A.

247
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,440
I went to this huge party and I was 
dressed up as spiderman and I realized 

248
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,941
when I had to walk around the party,
I was walking around the party like I 

249
00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:45,240
was spiderman.
Like I wasn't just stepping out like,

250
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,100
like I didn't do it on purpose.
I just,

251
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,280
it was so wrong.
I was really stoned in it.

252
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:52,250
I don't know if it was weird.
So you're really still in.

253
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:57,570
You thought you were aspiring.
I just caught myself walking 

254
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:57,570
differences.

255
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:57,570
The same dude by the way,
that.

256
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,760
So that he doesn't like certain video 
games because now when he sees buildings

257
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,860
he wants to jump from one building to 
the other.

258
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,300
This is,
play this in games.

259
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,340
He actually thinks that he could go do 
that.

260
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:05,880
No,
no,

261
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:10,881
no.
He won't know what you're getting lost 

262
00:11:10,881 --> 00:11:10,881
in the character,
which is totally cool,

263
00:11:10,881 --> 00:11:10,881
man.
I was talking about.

264
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,580
I played so much of this particular 
video game in a short amount of time,

265
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:14,860
like,
like,

266
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,990
like all day long that it got to the 
point where I was driving and I'm just 

267
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,760
like kind of space out and think,
oh hey look at building.

268
00:11:20,761 --> 00:11:21,720
I could jump on it.
I could see,

269
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,630
you know what I mean?
I thinking of retarded shit.

270
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,810
You never usually want to talk about 
thinking about that shit.

271
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:33,070
Like man,
like I'm actually thinking about the 

272
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,091
fucking video games jumping around just 
because you played how many hours 

273
00:11:35,091 --> 00:11:35,091
straight dude plant.
Uh,

274
00:11:35,091 --> 00:11:37,020
at that time I had played it for like 
all day long.

275
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:38,730
I wake up,
go to bed,

276
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,440
you know,
that's ridiculous.

277
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:46,090
For a month though,
that was the only time I ever became 

278
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:46,290
addicted to my little nephew.
That's his problem right now.

279
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:51,291
They got to take away that fucking game 
controller because he plays all fucking 

280
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:51,930
dates,
fucking up his grades and all that Shit.

281
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,620
And my sister's like,
oh,

282
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,160
we only

283
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,200
let them have that video game on 
weekends.

284
00:11:56,201 --> 00:12:01,201
And they got,
they take the controllers and they 

285
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:02,761
fucking hide them.
He goes looking forward and breaks them 

286
00:12:02,761 --> 00:12:05,100
fucking roll.
So all they really need to do is have 

287
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,430
like a video game controller,
like dealer at school.

288
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,060
I hit little plug in.
How easy is that?

289
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,820
I'm real lucky that I didn't have video 
games when I was a kid.

290
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,620
I mean we have like stupid,
like the ones on tv that you,

291
00:12:16,621 --> 00:12:18,670
you'd play like a.
I forget what they were,

292
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,250
but they weren't.
I think Mike Tyson's punch out.

293
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:26,251
I think we had that.
I think that was like when I was around 

294
00:12:26,251 --> 00:12:26,251
high school,
I had a Atari the peasant later.

295
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,350
That was all I had.
That wasn't data addictive.

296
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,680
I mean it was okay,
but there's nothing like call of duty or

297
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,420
it was amazing back then.

298
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,010
Space invaders at your house.
It was amazing.

299
00:12:37,011 --> 00:12:38,230
Like fuck.
Yeah,

300
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:40,600
but I'm talking about the sheer at 
diction value of it.

301
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:42,380
It's not even close to the video game 
Sunday.

302
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:47,390
No,
these people are having real problems 

303
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,411
with their kids starving.
It's like a regular basis because 

304
00:12:49,411 --> 00:12:52,171
they're not feeding their kids because 
they get lost in these massive 

305
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:55,201
multiplayer war.
A world games like world of warcraft 

306
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:56,320
games,
man.

307
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,500
This substitutes these people's lives 
like the sims and there's farmdale girl 

308
00:13:01,511 --> 00:13:06,511
just beat her kid to death because the 
kid was crying and it was interrupting 

309
00:13:06,511 --> 00:13:06,511
her Farmville game.
Yeah,

310
00:13:06,511 --> 00:13:08,590
it's fucked up.
You know that new call of duty game that

311
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:10,930
came out last night?
Modern ops or whatever.

312
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:12,010
I don't even know what the name of it 
is.

313
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:17,190
I just saw that it's in three d.
that's one of the first video games to 

314
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,670
like release to be made to be played on 
a three D tv.

315
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:23,730
So you know that three d we saw the 
other day at this by Holy Shit and 

316
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:23,730
playing call of duty.
Now,

317
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,780
dude,
I did not realize how bad ass three d 

318
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,080
looks now with,
with a movie that's animated for Three d

319
00:13:29,081 --> 00:13:31,900
and then you get one of those three d 
glasses and you watch on the new three d

320
00:13:31,901 --> 00:13:34,540
TVs.
It's fucking incredible,

321
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:35,830
man.
It's just like,

322
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,720
it's overwhelming.
Like you look at it,

323
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,040
you're just going,
wow,

324
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,220
isn't it weird that it's fired me taking
off?

325
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,760
I mean we had three d back when I was 
10,

326
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:47,140
but it's not taking them out.
It's a huge fucking trick.

327
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,790
It,
it came out almost a year ago.

328
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,050
You know how many blue ray DVD,
three d movies that they're out to,

329
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:57,250
two or two or three.
I think the third one just came out the 

330
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:57,250
other day,
like hd,

331
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:57,250
same thing.

332
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,710
There wasn't going to hd channels,
but you stick around,

333
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:02,800
there's no way to.
D is going to fuck with three D,

334
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,750
three d,
it's going to take over all.

335
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,520
They're making all movies in three d 
now.

336
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:08,760
Like every shooting porn in Three D.
Oh yeah,

337
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,100
yeah,
yeah.

338
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:11,470
They've been doing it for awhile.
That's still the way to bring porn back.

339
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,200
How are you going to do three d?
You can download three d and that.

340
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,710
Ultimately you'll be able to doubt it's 
going to make a big company.

341
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,960
We invest in porn.
Is that like a market?

342
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,850
It's got a bit.
That's actually smart.

343
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That's actually.
That doesn't make download bruises pop 

344
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,000
off the TV.
Right?

345
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,820
You could smell the food for sure.
For sure.

346
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:35,821
That kind of have loads coming at you.
You're gonna have to dodge a dodge them 

347
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:41,150
know there's going to come right at the 
screen and then we're going to shoot 

348
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:41,740
through a girl's face and she's going to
be able to cover the loads,

349
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,540
the loads coming from behind the camera 
or something.

350
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,380
Right.
Imagine.

351
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:52,770
Imagine if it was so good though.
If you had a wall projection TV and the 

352
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:56,411
legs were just being wrapped around you,
it's really going to be gay porn and 

353
00:14:56,411 --> 00:15:00,160
that takes off from three because what 
could a girl did with three d while 

354
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,160
she's having sex?
Like the titties coming at you.

355
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,870
I mean,
how often are,

356
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,530
it's just pop it,
you know,

357
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,290
the depth is way better when it's not 
just that,

358
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,670
you know,
you'd have like tricks that was like old

359
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:08,520
three,
d number,

360
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,470
jaws,
three d.

361
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:14,650
There was only one thing that happened 
that the shark went through the glass 

362
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:14,650
and you're like,
ah,

363
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,710
he's coming after the rest of it was 
bunk.

364
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,690
It was like tricks,
but now it's not tricks.

365
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,020
It's like they're doing that.
Yeah,

366
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,520
it's like that.
What was the monsters versus aliens is.

367
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,020
That was the animated show that we were 
watching.

368
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,240
That was in three days.
It was insane.

369
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,390
It was so vivid and there was so much to
it.

370
00:15:29,391 --> 00:15:33,410
There was like the depth was like.
It was really shocking.

371
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,180
Yeah.
That's what it's going to be.

372
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:40,181
Pretty soon it's going to be like where 
you look at your wall and it's like 

373
00:15:40,181 --> 00:15:42,490
you're looking into the next room that 
bats what's going like you're watching 

374
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:42,930
Seinfeld,
like as if Seinfeld was in your house.

375
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,640
If it's gotten as far.
I mean,

376
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,770
what it looks like.
It's pretty fucking incredible man.

377
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:54,100
Way better than the movies because 
movies a big or what happened last shit 

378
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,601
went bro.
We lost one of the channels for the 

379
00:15:58,601 --> 00:15:58,601
head.
That's what happened.

380
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:01,190
All on the same as you can get more 
creative with gay porn,

381
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,570
you know,
lost loads.

382
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:07,660
We're losing.
Well you've got a bad connection on the 

383
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:07,660
headsets.
All right,

384
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,490
so anyways,
it's in there,

385
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:14,030
but it looks way better than the movies 
because movie theaters,

386
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:16,220
it's like kind of shitty resolution.

387
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,750
It looks like grainy,
you know,

388
00:16:17,751 --> 00:16:18,860
even if it's a gi,
it's better.

389
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,280
Even if it's a giant screen,
it's not nearly as good as like a giant,

390
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:27,310
like 55 inch plasma screen.
The depth that you get when you look at 

391
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:31,181
it like a real good tv.
That's like the resolutions like way 

392
00:16:31,181 --> 00:16:33,590
crispr did you see jackass in three days
that was using old school,

393
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:36,110
three detectives.
Dildos coming towards your face.

394
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,420
So chapel wasn't using depth.
That was act.

395
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:43,510
They actually slowed down like things 
that you could see it come at you and 

396
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:48,430
they really.
That was the best movie that for the 

397
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:48,430
Three d content.
Real awesome for three days.

398
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,880
All I kept thinking about is,
I mean they're,

399
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,210
they're getting fucking some head trauma
going on there,

400
00:16:56,211 --> 00:17:00,740
really jacking their heads up for sure.
At least one of those dudes,

401
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,700
one of those dudes is going to have 
gehrig's disease.

402
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,420
You after watching that show on brain 
brain trauma,

403
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,550
that was real sports.
Yeah.

404
00:17:09,551 --> 00:17:11,360
What it was.
Are you more aware of that shit?

405
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,030
The whole time I was watching jackass,
I'm like,

406
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:15,290
God damn it.
It's funny.

407
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,300
It's all fun and games right now.
You're making a lot of money,

408
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:20,180
but they are really fucking themselves 
up.

409
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,660
I mean,
I saw the interview with Michael,

410
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:27,900
not Michael.
I'm with Muhammad Ali when he was 

411
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,940
Cassius clay and he was talking about 
retiring when he got to be a certain age

412
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,120
because I don't want to be one of them 
to fighters is old and it hit in the 

413
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:34,410
head too many times is talking Dah,
Dah,

414
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:36,170
Dah,
Dah role.

415
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,100
Whoa.
Yeah,

416
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:38,330
whoa indeed.
It was like,

417
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,860
it was so creepy to.
To listen to that.

418
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:44,950
Like you,
you're the king of dirt or you're the 

419
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,161
guy.
Whenever you talk about anybody where 

420
00:17:48,161 --> 00:17:49,980
anybody looks towards someone getting 
damaged from fighting

421
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,830
in it being a sad case,
he's the one and there's a lot of people

422
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:54,240
that are trying to say that he has 
Parkinson's.

423
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,160
It's not related the fuck.
It's not related.

424
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,920
That's a bullshit politically correct 
argument.

425
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,210
Yeah.
He's got Parkinson's.

426
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:05,211
What does that mean?
It means it's fucking brain is falling 

427
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:07,131
apart and why do you think he has it?
You don't think that has to do with the 

428
00:18:07,131 --> 00:18:08,330
fact that he got battered in the brain 
for decades.

429
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,660
You don't think that has something to do
with that.

430
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,840
That's crazy.
They had this thing on 48 hours with 

431
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,511
Jerry quarry.
Jerry quarry was like this great white 

432
00:18:17,511 --> 00:18:19,881
hope from the 19 seventies and they 
followed this dude around and he was 

433
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:25,530
like 53 years old when he died and they 
followed him around when he was 50 and 

434
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:25,920
he was gone,
gone.

435
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,560
There was nothing there.
He had no idea what was going on,

436
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,730
didn't know how to write his name.

437
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,980
His brother had to help him write it,
so he had Lou Gehrig's disease.

438
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,770
He had everything.
He had pugilistic dementia,

439
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:36,570
that's what they call it.
That's what they were calling it.

440
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,640
No,
as far as is it Lou Gehrig's disease?

441
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,330
Lou Gehrig's disease is is the same 
thing that Stephen Hawking has.

442
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,760
It's your,
your,

443
00:18:43,761 --> 00:18:48,761
your,
your body loses its ability to move 

444
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:48,761
itself.
There's a bunch of different things.

445
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:49,140
I mean,
Muhammad Ali has Parkinson's,

446
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,510
you know,
this guy had pugilistic dementia,

447
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,270
which is just dementia brought on by 
being punched.

448
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,480
The whole deal is,
you know,

449
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:01,690
it's,
it's scary because we see it all the 

450
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:01,690
time,
man.

451
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:01,690
We see guys getting checked in the head 
all the time.

452
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:02,280
You know,
it's a big part of what we do.

453
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,520
Trill Shit so much fun to watch though.
God is willing to put their brains on 

454
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:15,320
the line for our entertainment.
Well,

455
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,760
it's just they gotta know when to stop.
That's the thing.

456
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,350
I mean,
you can do it a few times.

457
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,380
You can,
you can even get shut off a couple of 

458
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:24,380
times,
but you gotta know when to stop and it's

459
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,640
everybody's when is different and that's
when it gets tricky.

460
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,260
You know?
No one can tell you.

461
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:33,380
Remember Alastar overeem when he was 
getting knocked out all the time and I 

462
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,530
lost our overeem,
was getting like jacked over and over 

463
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:36,530
again.
Surgery Keratan off Jack Damn.

464
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,500
Chuck Odell,
Jack Them,

465
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:42,710
a lot of guys stopped him.
I think he's been stopped like seven or 

466
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:42,710
eight times,
at least six.

467
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,260
So I mean he had been beaten up a bunch 
of times both in kickboxing and in an,

468
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:52,570
in an mma,
but then all of a sudden he makes his 

469
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,621
fucking tremendous come back and now 
he's one of the best fighters in the 

470
00:19:54,621 --> 00:19:54,621
world.

471
00:19:54,621 --> 00:19:58,160
So it's like you can't never say that a 
dude's done because he made a comeback 

472
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,330
and then made a Sitcom back in striking 
and k one,

473
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:05,570
you know,
the fact that he was able to have that 

474
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:05,570
kind of success in just straight 
striking.

475
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:05,570
I mean,
that's,

476
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,370
that's pretty God damn process.
So you can't tell it got to stop because

477
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:09,810
I would have told Alastar over him and 
stuff.

478
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,680
You know,
who the fuck are you?

479
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,020
When do you draw the line?
Is it five cows for cows?

480
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,520
You know,
I think Peter has been stopped some 

481
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,981
crazy amount of time,
like 14 times over the course of his 

482
00:20:21,981 --> 00:20:25,041
career to something nutty like that.
Think about that,

483
00:20:25,221 --> 00:20:25,780
huh?
Yeah.

484
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,480
What if they find out?
What if they find [inaudible] get to is 

485
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:31,480
fairly new.
What did they find out that,

486
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,590
you know,
if you get choked out like unconscious,

487
00:20:34,591 --> 00:20:39,591
like from a rear naked choke or at Doris
or something like 20 slash 25 times 

488
00:20:39,591 --> 00:20:43,430
you're,
you're susceptible to get Lou gehrig's 

489
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:43,430
disease just from getting,
you know,

490
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,710
really getting shut off.
I found out.

491
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,980
Who knows?
I would say that they know that you

492
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,980
can be deprived of blood to the brain 
for a certain amount of time before 

493
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,470
there's damage set in,
but how do they know that?

494
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:58,740
I mean they,
they know that people have gotten 

495
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,931
damaged because there had blood shut off
to their brain for x amount of seconds 

496
00:21:00,931 --> 00:21:02,050
or x or is it a minute?
I mean how,

497
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,050
what is the amount of time where you 
start getting brain damage?

498
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,220
Number two,
what?

499
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,980
This one's where you're saying like if 
you really hated somebody,

500
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,690
you'd choke them out,
but not to kill them,

501
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:15,750
just hold on for 90 seconds and started 
and that's a character who wanted to 

502
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,650
develop a guy who's like,
he's like a,

503
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,200
like a dexter or you know,
he just kills people,

504
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:25,201
but he doesn't kill him.
He just chokes him out just for 58 

505
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,980
seconds just to turn them into a 
vegetable so he doesn't,

506
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,450
he doesn't go down for murder.

507
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:33,450
No one knows how this person became a 
vegetable and they just make it a 

508
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:37,261
romantic comedy.
And then like one dude and the conflict 

509
00:21:37,261 --> 00:21:38,920
is three jokes becomes a level,
does it for money.

510
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:41,230
He's just like the secret assassin.
He's not killing anybody.

511
00:21:41,231 --> 00:21:43,540
He's just turning your enemies into like
you pay them.

512
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,780
And then one guy,
he didn't choke long enough and the guy 

513
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,241
can kind of talk and he's trying to bust
them out so he has to figure out how to 

514
00:21:51,241 --> 00:21:53,410
fucking get near him again to choke them
out of the guys pointing out was like,

515
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,550
I got to put this motherfucker and an 
arm triangle one more time.

516
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:03,270
But Tom,
but it just,

517
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,060
so that missile thing a lot of people 
don't notice,

518
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,750
but there was a missile was fired last 
night off of the coast of California.

519
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,370
Malibu area.
Yeah.

520
00:22:12,371 --> 00:22:14,740
I heard it on Carson radio show this 
morning.

521
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,400
And he said that,
you know,

522
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,630
he,
that's where he lives.

523
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,630
He didn't see anything and he had all 
these radio show.

524
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,420
Carson Daly,
Carson Daly has a radio show on k rock.

525
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:23,550
I think he does.
Yeah.

526
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,400
In the morning kid rock is Kevin and 
been a,

527
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,210
I think maybe after,
uh,

528
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,180
but he,
he,

529
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:35,190
uh,
he was saying that he didn't see 

530
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,481
anything.
So he had all these callers calling and 

531
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:37,720
then it was like two hours later 
everyone said they saw something but not

532
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,550
with the time that everyone else is 
saying so.

533
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,980
Well they have pictures of it.
Yeah,

534
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,520
it is.
Something happened.

535
00:22:42,521 --> 00:22:43,960
Yeah.
There was one before that happened.

536
00:22:43,961 --> 00:22:48,670
I remember I was driving,
I was in Hollywood and the sky was like,

537
00:22:48,671 --> 00:22:52,210
it was just turning dusk,
so it was kinda like half dark,

538
00:22:52,211 --> 00:22:55,030
half light.
And they launched a rocket and you could

539
00:22:55,031 --> 00:23:00,031
really see whatever this thing was,
this missile you could really see like 

540
00:23:00,031 --> 00:23:00,280
the contrary all behind it and 
everything.

541
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,930
It was pretty dramatic,
you know?

542
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:03,220
And then they had a,
you know,

543
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:07,770
tell people that they do these things at
night and that this one was a,

544
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,600
it was from at Edwards Air Force Base I 
guess,

545
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,210
and they shot it at night,
but it was just not dark enough.

546
00:23:13,211 --> 00:23:15,220
They miscalculated the time so people 
get to see it.

547
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,170
So it's like,
what do you mean they just shoot shit up

548
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,810
in the air.
Did they do this all the time?

549
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:20,920
Yeah.
My friend is in the navy,

550
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:25,921
says they shoot missiles all the time.
Where do they go to the water shoot dead

551
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:33,271
missiles.
And imagine if you were in a fucking 

552
00:23:33,271 --> 00:23:35,550
rowboat and nobody knew you were out 
there and you got hit in the head by a 

553
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:38,671
missile.
Just a random mean people have been 

554
00:23:38,671 --> 00:23:41,911
shot.
They've been shot by people shooting up 

555
00:23:41,911 --> 00:23:43,951
in the air.
The bullet goes up in the air and then 

556
00:23:43,951 --> 00:23:43,951
lands on people.
That's happened a bunch of times.

557
00:23:43,951 --> 00:23:45,500
Could you imagine if you got hit in the 
head by a mess?

558
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,950
Jones is saying about this missile thing
or if he even knows about it,

559
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,130
how it is.
Basically the new world order,

560
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:53,310
the elites.
I'll move.

561
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,700
I gotta move my fault.
The new world order.

562
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:57,710
The elites know what the fuck would he 
say?

563
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,660
He would say something stupid.
It was Obama.

564
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,320
Say something about life extension.
We had a crazy experience in Texas with 

565
00:24:05,421 --> 00:24:07,770
Alex Jones with show ideas.
What happened?

566
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,620
Joe?
What did I met?

567
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,860
Lit the Alex Jones show on fire.
What?

568
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,740
Off Milestones fucked up and this is 
where he fucked up.

569
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,010
He had joey come on and it was his idea 
to bring joey into the room.

570
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,780
He's talking to me about what about chem
trails?

571
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,820
What about what about what's going on 
with the environment?

572
00:24:22,821 --> 00:24:27,821
You know what's going on,
what about they're going to kill the 

573
00:24:27,821 --> 00:24:29,861
dollar.
So he's got all this stuff that he's 

574
00:24:29,861 --> 00:24:31,871
bringing up with me and then Joey's 
outside and we're just talking kind of 

575
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:32,630
like straight real conspiracy theory.

576
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,830
Alex Jones style.
But he brings Joey in and we.

577
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,540
We were at the end of the show,
so he goes,

578
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:43,541
well,
we're going to go into overdrive right 

579
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:44,510
now and we're going to overdraft super 
secret overdrive a lot on the Internet,

580
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,200
but uh,
you know,

581
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:46,670
you can swear it's all right.
It's not FCC,

582
00:24:46,671 --> 00:24:48,980
but don't try not to swear.
So He'd fucked up.

583
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:54,040
He gave the green light to joey.
He let joey know that Joey can just go 

584
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,470
off.
And so joey starts going off.

585
00:24:54,471 --> 00:24:56,390
First of all,
he's going off about Cuba,

586
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,840
about how this is a free country.
Well,

587
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,180
the real,
when it really went awry,

588
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,460
it was when he started talking about 
smuggling drugs.

589
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,140
He goes,
I got get on the plane.

590
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:11,290
I had the sack under my ball sack.
I put the sack of weed and I was 

591
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,350
thinking like a motherfucker and he's 
going,

592
00:25:12,351 --> 00:25:13,600
no,
no,

593
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:13,770
no.

594
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:14,660
Alex Jones going,
no,

595
00:25:14,661 --> 00:25:15,200
you didn't.
He goes,

596
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:15,800
no,
I did.

597
00:25:15,801 --> 00:25:20,801
It was under my left arm and left leg 
than my right ball because I'm right 

598
00:25:20,801 --> 00:25:20,801
handed.
I thought I had cancer for awhile.

599
00:25:20,801 --> 00:25:23,060
So.
And he just goes deep.

600
00:25:23,061 --> 00:25:26,630
Joey dss as an,
as Alex Jones is going.

601
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,980
Well No,
no.

602
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,950
That didn't happen.
No,

603
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,390
it didn't happen.
Cox,

604
00:25:30,391 --> 00:25:32,720
I got Obama freedom of speech.
So He's,

605
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,850
he's going fucking crazy.
And um,

606
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:39,560
Alex Jones can't figure out what to do 
and I am laughing my balls off.

607
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,910
So as I'm laughing,
you know,

608
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:45,911
Joey,
if he's got an audience and that 

609
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:45,911
audience is laughing,
Joey knows how to finish the ages.

610
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,720
Ages rage.
It gets red,

611
00:25:47,721 --> 00:25:50,810
he starts getting sweaty,
he knows how to finish the deal.

612
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:55,900
So he's going off about how stinky this 
weed is under his ball sack and that 

613
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,741
he'd go through the x ray machine and he
thought he was going to have to get 

614
00:25:59,741 --> 00:25:59,741
arrested.

615
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:00,890
And then the more more Alex Jones 
protests,

616
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:02,750
the crazier guy,
joey finally,

617
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,160
you know Joe,
he stands up.

618
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,450
He always likes to stay up.
What?

619
00:26:05,451 --> 00:26:06,890
He's going to end something and walk 
away.

620
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,960
He's in a fury of frenzy.
He goes,

621
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,580
Joe Def,
facebook,

622
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,290
twitter.
He stands up and he goes,

623
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,690
check yourself before you wreck 
yourself.

624
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:19,750
Big Dixon gas is bad for your health.
Stay black because that's the most 

625
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:19,910
important thing,
to stay black.

626
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:25,470
And the whole time he's screaming into 
the microphone to make it worse so you 

627
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:25,470
know,
he's,

628
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:28,850
he's grabbing the microphone is big paws
and screaming into the best part is when

629
00:26:28,851 --> 00:26:33,851
he first walked into like Alex Jones as 
studio setup where the camera's facing 

630
00:26:33,851 --> 00:26:38,291
him like directly and he show,
he just stands right in front of it and 

631
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:39,650
leans down on one knee right in front of
the camera.

632
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:44,651
So if you look at the video of you can 
find the video anywhere like gets just 

633
00:26:44,651 --> 00:26:44,651
Alex

634
00:26:44,651 --> 00:26:47,550
and then this big head like blocking his
view.

635
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,280
And then it's the cameraman all 
scrambling for new shots.

636
00:26:50,281 --> 00:26:53,430
And it's all like Joey Diaz,
his head covering everyone's faces.

637
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,280
Joe,
he's a fucking national treasure man.

638
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:01,530
You realize moments like this.
I mean I'm giving it no justice here 

639
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,250
describing and I'm trying to describe it
right?

640
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,920
You got to see it.
We're going to have it up in a video and

641
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,600
it's available online.
You can see the whole thing,

642
00:27:06,601 --> 00:27:07,680
but we'll,
we're going to edit it,

643
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,980
put together the right parts in a whole 
video of the whole Austin trip.

644
00:27:10,981 --> 00:27:14,250
Because Austin was and always is the 
shit.

645
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,280
Every time I go there to film,
it seems like magic happens.

646
00:27:17,281 --> 00:27:22,281
That is one of the best cities in the 
fucking state or one of the best cities 

647
00:27:22,281 --> 00:27:22,281
in the world,
man.

648
00:27:22,281 --> 00:27:24,470
It really is because it's.
Well,

649
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,160
it is one of the best cities in the 
state.

650
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:31,310
It's also one of the best cities in the 
country and if this is the best country 

651
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:31,320
in the world that that's one of the best
countries or cities in the world.

652
00:27:31,321 --> 00:27:36,321
I just fucked that whole thing.
Not only is the food amazing everywhere 

653
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,310
you go,
the food is fucking amazing.

654
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:43,580
Everywhere you go.
The women are beautiful and awesome and 

655
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,290
nice and loved a man.
It's a friendly place.

656
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,000
There's a few spots like that on this 
country,

657
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:49,500
man,
where people are friendlier.

658
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,510
That's one of the best ones.
Austin,

659
00:27:51,511 --> 00:27:54,060
Texas is one of the best ones.
Fucking great music,

660
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:56,460
but the smartest ones too,
you know,

661
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,960
just so many smart,
cool,

662
00:27:57,961 --> 00:27:59,500
interesting people there.
It's just a.

663
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:02,760
it's a fun fucking place to do worse 
highways ever.

664
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,040
The GPS just tweaks when it tries to 
find the exit.

665
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,070
For some reason they decided instead of 
make their highways wider,

666
00:28:11,071 --> 00:28:13,170
they decide to stack them on top of each
other,

667
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:17,820
so the logic behind it is so strange and
if you make me miss an exit,

668
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,010
it's so impossible.

669
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,210
Yet the roundabout it you're fucked.
You're fucked.

670
00:28:21,211 --> 00:28:24,470
Because almost every exit becomes a new 
highway in another direction,

671
00:28:24,471 --> 00:28:24,690
you know,
like,

672
00:28:24,691 --> 00:28:26,940
where's this one going?
Steph?

673
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,470
It's death if you,
if you miss,

674
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:29,820
if you miss a spot,
you're fucked.

675
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,610
But other than that,
it's the shit.

676
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:38,490
Jessica Alba was here.
The first clip that we got those classic

677
00:28:38,491 --> 00:28:41,570
from Austin was the clam thing with 
Arctic plant.

678
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,350
They painted that whole green room to.
We did that.

679
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,890
That was sad.
The these,

680
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:51,891
the green room in the Austin Cap city 
comedy club used to be covered with 

681
00:28:51,891 --> 00:28:54,180
graffiti and now it's just all painted 
and it was like famous comics.

682
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:59,390
Some comics are dead.
I think Mitch Hedberg was on there and 

683
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,690
stuff and they decided to paint this 
green over it.

684
00:29:00,691 --> 00:29:01,540
Yeah.
I asked him,

685
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,150
what happened?
Burger King buy you guys out.

686
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:03,960
Like,
fuck yeah.

687
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,970
It felt like a Kia or something like 
the.

688
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,210
Why would they do that?
I don't know.

689
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,840
That was the biggest fail ever.
They should.

690
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,160
Somebody should take a picture of that 
green room and just call it fail.

691
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:16,190
Well,
someone should do is find photos of it 

692
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:16,350
all online and make wallpaper.
Glue it back on.

693
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,480
I took,
I've taken.

694
00:29:18,481 --> 00:29:23,481
Most of them you should do is enlarge 
everything up high resolution like with 

695
00:29:23,481 --> 00:29:27,010
some fucking Gene Hackman movie type 
technology where they can take a big 

696
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:30,381
picture and actually make it look good.
Maybe we'll wait until it's LCD 

697
00:29:30,381 --> 00:29:32,870
wallpaper and I'll just email them if a 
bitch.

698
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:33,990
Yeah.
How could they do that?

699
00:29:33,991 --> 00:29:38,991
Man?
That was that place in the Atlanta 

700
00:29:38,991 --> 00:29:38,991
punchline.
That's another one.

701
00:29:38,991 --> 00:29:39,150
The Atlanta punchline to green rooms 
just covered with.

702
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,340
One of my favorite ones is trying to be 
Hicks.

703
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:46,630
Somebody had that as their avatar photo 
on the Rogan board for Awhile.

704
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:51,690
The best one was in Austin when it was 
always my favorite and that's the one 

705
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,600
thing I always think it's that pee on 
the toilet seat.

706
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,820
Maybe we'll keep women out of comedy.
No,

707
00:29:54,821 --> 00:29:58,750
keep the toilet seat up.
Maybe we'll keep women at a kind of take

708
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:03,760
my own life and I'm not a person that 
lifts might the toilet seat nps.

709
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:10,140
I'm one of the Ip through it because I 
grew up with my mom and my sister and I 

710
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,431
just use.
I just wash it every time he piss all 

711
00:30:14,431 --> 00:30:15,640
over the toilet seat and know my aim is 
amazing,

712
00:30:15,641 --> 00:30:18,010
but once in a while you'll get that one 
little teeny drop.

713
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,060
So it's a once in a while.
Someone has to sit in your peers?

714
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,820
No,
because then I clean.

715
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,530
I always clean it with water and toilet 
paper.

716
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:27,040
What about soap?
Was that enough?

717
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,380
If someone pissed on your fork and then 
cleaned it with water and Toilet Paper,

718
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,770
you drink pee?
I don't.

719
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,060
I don't think I'd have to worry about 
your little buddy.

720
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,780
I don't say it.
Do it every day and it's not mine.

721
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,650
It's his big difference between if I 
said,

722
00:30:41,651 --> 00:30:44,350
you know,
if I drank p for a stunt on a radio show

723
00:30:44,351 --> 00:30:46,390
or if I piss in your mouth.
These are two.

724
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:47,590
Totally.
It's like the old thing,

725
00:30:47,591 --> 00:30:52,591
like we just always talk about your 
stand wiping up or do you sit down and 

726
00:30:52,591 --> 00:30:53,980
go through the legs?
Me and Joe are both standards.

727
00:30:53,981 --> 00:30:58,510
Are you a standard wipe and then I 
jumped in the shower.

728
00:30:58,511 --> 00:31:00,550
I don't.
I just wiped warm shower every time.

729
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,720
Every time.
Wow.

730
00:31:01,721 --> 00:31:03,310
What if your shower?
Every time he shit,

731
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:06,570
unless I'm like at a public restroom,
but my shift consistent.

732
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,650
Wow.
In the morning when I wake up,

733
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,300
10:00,
I'm ready to go.

734
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:15,360
I have a bad day.
I never even used that to Chris from 

735
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:15,360
fleshlight did he tell you about a day?

736
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,720
A day that has like a laser that finds 
your asshole then shoots water at your 

737
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,171
asshole at the same temperature of your 
skin and then it comes out with another 

738
00:31:25,171 --> 00:31:25,990
laser that shoots and finds the 
hairdryer and it dries your asshole?

739
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:26,830
Yeah,
at some.

740
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,080
Well,
I heard about it in Japan,

741
00:31:29,081 --> 00:31:30,570
they have these.
They're toilet seats.

742
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:33,350
It's not a bad day.
It's actually a system.

743
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,390
Maurice.
Maurice called me up and Maury Smith,

744
00:31:37,391 --> 00:31:40,660
I call me under the Joseph.
This is a great business opportunity.

745
00:31:40,661 --> 00:31:41,520
Okay.
Listen to this,

746
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,140
starts telling me about toilet seats.
I'll tell you what,

747
00:31:44,141 --> 00:31:49,141
it's not a bad idea because that's one 
technology that has not changed since I 

748
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:50,170
was a kid.
You were a kid like that.

749
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,130
It's the same.
Wow.

750
00:31:51,131 --> 00:31:52,810
You got cushion.
That's it.

751
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:55,090
Why aren't we perfected that shit?
Yeah,

752
00:31:55,091 --> 00:31:57,340
but no one's gonna.
No one's gonna buy them.

753
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,230
It's hard to get $300.

754
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,650
I would buy 300 bucks.
Yes.

755
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,500
Probably a lot more than that though.
Probably really.

756
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,770
Lasers,
your asshole.

757
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:08,590
Find that shit's got to cost like 
$7,000,

758
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,000
like cheeks and shit.
Probably that.

759
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,640
You know what I mean?
Blow dries you.

760
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,180
Who has a Taser and it was $500 
installed.

761
00:32:16,181 --> 00:32:17,320
I would buy it.
No Way.

762
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:20,220
500 bucks.
You would the ones that are 500 to going

763
00:32:20,221 --> 00:32:23,750
to miss your asshole,
but how can it get your butt to hurt?

764
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,780
They're going to hurt you,
but it's going to be pounding in there.

765
00:32:25,781 --> 00:32:28,030
It's going to splatter all the shit 
around your balls.

766
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,680
Throw some heat warmers on that.
That I would do 600.

767
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:35,850
They have warmers too.
That's the other thing that he did the 

768
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:35,850
heated seat sit down.
It's all warm and comfy,

769
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:39,020
but Bluetooth on it.
Seven Hundred Dollars Bluetooth you have

770
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:42,230
from her coughing your toilet speakers 
behind you,

771
00:32:42,231 --> 00:32:44,150
like really nice bose speakers.

772
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,490
You're just sitting there talking with 
someone.

773
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,260
They hear the echo and they get mad at 
you.

774
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:53,290
Are you shitting and talking to me?
I told you to disconnect the Bluetooth 

775
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:56,921
on the toilet.
They'll have like a jawbone of a second 

776
00:32:56,921 --> 00:32:56,921
microphone that's outside and we'll mix 
the two.

777
00:32:56,921 --> 00:33:01,390
How about to somebody that gets upset at
you when you're talking to them when 

778
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,330
you're taking a shit and now I never.
They never figured out.

779
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:07,420
I've told people before they get upset.
I've told people that this are you 

780
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:07,420
paying on my campaign?
Is that okay?

781
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,380
I can hear you.
I like pretending we don't pee pad and a

782
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:15,400
pen and a big deal,
but if you're on the phone and you shit 

783
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,850
and you like your ass explodes like one 
of those nuclear sheds.

784
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,060
You know what I mean?
When you got to wipe you gotta clean the

785
00:33:20,061 --> 00:33:20,570
toilet.

786
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,430
There's only a few people that can do 
that with.

787
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:27,680
You don't usually want to do that.
Like when someone's on the phone and I 

788
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,291
said your buddy,
but if it's like a girl enough for a 

789
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:30,620
business meeting,
I have face time with our.

790
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,920
Sometimes I fall on the phone.
I'm like,

791
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,870
well I hope they don't.
They didn't hear that one.

792
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,030
I got to pull a but apart.
There was one,

793
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:41,330
there was one time when he called me by 
facetime and he was shitting,

794
00:33:41,331 --> 00:33:41,990
so I was like,
you know what,

795
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,580
I have to poop to.
Let's do this.

796
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,780
Facetime.
Double Shit.

797
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,410
I haven't used the face time yet.
You guys like it?

798
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,980
Oh it's great.
Now they have a Beta on your Max.

799
00:33:49,981 --> 00:33:52,730
He could face time from a computer to 
iphone.

800
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:55,280
So if somebody's at home you'd be like,
jump on your computer.

801
00:33:55,281 --> 00:34:00,281
You know?
And so now you can face time between 

802
00:34:00,281 --> 00:34:00,281
those two devices.

803
00:34:00,281 --> 00:34:00,281
One,
is that really necessary?

804
00:34:00,281 --> 00:34:05,201
It's like your girlfriend and she's like
on the other side of the world or 

805
00:34:05,201 --> 00:34:05,201
something.
Well yeah,

806
00:34:05,201 --> 00:34:05,600
you know,
we're all on the road.

807
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:11,590
That's about it.
Is that like your buddies did get on 

808
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:11,590
facetime,
Bro.

809
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,310
Gonna fucking do that.
Well,

810
00:34:13,311 --> 00:34:18,311
we talked about this before that 
eventually we're going to have little 

811
00:34:18,311 --> 00:34:18,311
cameras in front of us on like fishing 
poles.

812
00:34:18,311 --> 00:34:21,230
You know,
her hang hanging from our fishing poles.

813
00:34:21,231 --> 00:34:24,080
It's probably going to be like hovering 
floating with you.

814
00:34:24,081 --> 00:34:29,081
Right.
It'd be a proximity droid to miss the 

815
00:34:29,081 --> 00:34:32,330
best technology with the oldest 
technology or fishing poles.

816
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,430
Don't feel the need for it.
But I mean that's what I said.

817
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,530
I used to say about text messages.
I used to joke about it.

818
00:34:38,531 --> 00:34:41,120
It takes you four presses to get an ass.
Pardon my act.

819
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:46,840
The whole thing about.
Remember when you started the whole 

820
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:46,840
thing about next town next to.

821
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,720
They don't have walkie talkies anymore.
Do they?

822
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,040
They still do that?
Uh,

823
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:49,730
yeah.
Yeah.

824
00:34:49,731 --> 00:34:54,380
I think Brazil in Brazil next tell is 
like fucking burger king.

825
00:34:54,381 --> 00:34:55,760
No Dude,
they run shit.

826
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,920
They failed in the states.
They said fuck it.

827
00:34:57,921 --> 00:35:02,240
We still got Brazil.
Brazil do next toe is huge in Brazil.

828
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:04,520
Really did love the walkie talkie 
feature.

829
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,530
It's on verizon.
It's on all of them.

830
00:35:06,531 --> 00:35:07,910
You know,
there's a funny story,

831
00:35:07,911 --> 00:35:12,911
there's um,
there was this dude in front of a 

832
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:13,520
Roscoe's chicken and waffles and he was 
on a speaker phone and he was talking by

833
00:35:13,521 --> 00:35:18,521
himself just standing there by himself 
on a speaker phone talking and talking 

834
00:35:18,521 --> 00:35:18,521
out loud.
You can hear this conversation.

835
00:35:18,521 --> 00:35:23,320
And so I twittered I said,
what is it about black dudes that like 

836
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:23,540
to talk on the speakerphone is when 
they're by themselves,

837
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,740
like what?
What is the deal with that?

838
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,640
And all these fucking people got mad at 
me.

839
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,920
A lot of black people got mad at me.
Yo,

840
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,220
that's dickish.
That was dickish like what?

841
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:33,890
That whoa,
Whoa,

842
00:35:33,891 --> 00:35:36,050
whoa.
I didn't say shit about you.

843
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,320
Okay.
I said,

844
00:35:37,321 --> 00:35:42,321
what is it with all these black people 
that like to talk on speakerphone just 

845
00:35:42,321 --> 00:35:44,040
because you're black and if you're doing
that.

846
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,870
I'm not dickish.
I'm just observing.

847
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:51,020
What is that?
That's a weird thing that I don't see 

848
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,211
that many white people do them,
but I see a lot of black people doing 

849
00:35:53,211 --> 00:35:53,211
and it's not a negative thing.
Like what?

850
00:35:53,211 --> 00:35:54,570
He does a lot of fucking douchey things 
that white people do too.

851
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:57,600
But I'm not being racist here.
I'm observing something.

852
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:02,780
Are you saying that I'm not allowed to 
observe because you share the same 

853
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,811
melanin content is this person I'm 
observing and even though you're not 

854
00:36:05,811 --> 00:36:05,811
even doing the same thing that they're 
doing,

855
00:36:05,811 --> 00:36:10,460
that's fucking ridiculous that we're,
we're real close with racism in this 

856
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:10,770
country,
man.

857
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:13,560
We're real close to being ridiculous.
It is ridiculous.

858
00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:15,200
The whole thing is ridiculous.
You know,

859
00:36:15,201 --> 00:36:17,670
like with especially like the whole,
uh,

860
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:21,990
anger between feeling like you have to 
fight somebody because of their race.

861
00:36:21,991 --> 00:36:26,991
You know,
like there's people like beating up 

862
00:36:26,991 --> 00:36:27,110
different races just because of what 
race does that mean?

863
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,290
That's legit.
Racism,

864
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:33,291
but I'm talking about is the opposite.
I'm talking about people looking to 

865
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,640
point the finger at racism when you're 
really just acknowledging something.

866
00:36:35,641 --> 00:36:37,770
That's a fact.
I'm just seeing something.

867
00:36:37,771 --> 00:36:38,800
I'm like,
what?

868
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,920
The fact that I said that they happen to
be black.

869
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:41,490
Yeah.
Well,

870
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:43,600
so does going to be black.
So why do they do this black?

871
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,090
Why do these brothers be doing that?
Or No,

872
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,250
they just do it.
I don't know why to do it.

873
00:36:47,251 --> 00:36:48,560
But you didn't get an answer?
No.

874
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,830
No one has an answer.
No,

875
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:51,810
but most people were saying their 
attention whores,

876
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,280
you know,
and that's what,

877
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:59,060
I guess one of the reasons why people 
were getting mad at me as I was saying 

878
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,060
that black people were attending.

879
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,460
So which is not what I'm saying.
I'm saying I see a lot of black people 

880
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,080
that like to talk on speakerphone when 
they're by themselves.

881
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,600
I don't see why people doing it.
It doesn't mean they're not doing it,

882
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,990
but I'm asking.
It's something I see and might not allow

883
00:37:09,991 --> 00:37:11,820
it to see things because people are 
black.

884
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,130
Like that's a tricky fucking road to 
walk down.

885
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,270
That's nonsense.
You know what?

886
00:37:15,271 --> 00:37:20,271
Maybe it's because they don't want to 
get brain cancer and they're just more 

887
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,060
concerned about it than white people.
Dude,

888
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:24,030
I know somebody that does that though.
I know somebody that only talks to using

889
00:37:24,031 --> 00:37:25,860
the speakerphone function for some 
reason.

890
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,180
Yeah,
but not in public.

891
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:28,770
Outside.
They do it.

892
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,470
They do it at olive garden.
Who is.

893
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,480
It has a slight esther does.
She's black or at least she likes Black 

894
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,260
Dick for sure.
Why?

895
00:37:39,261 --> 00:37:40,170
Why does she do that?

896
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,000
Uh,
I have no idea.

897
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,320
I have no idea.
She records every single phone call 

898
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:47,320
between her and her parents too because 
it's fair.

899
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:52,040
Her parents are so ridiculous,
but she's just really weird with her 

900
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,040
phone and phone calls.
That's funny man.

901
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,740
Sorry about that.
I think it's cool.

902
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:59,930
I think it's cool.
Do he really just trying to help you 

903
00:37:59,930 --> 00:37:59,930
out?
Yeah,

904
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:01,470
it's a tricky thing man.
There's,

905
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:05,640
there was a white girl at the airport 
who's talking her ass off,

906
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,700
like just really fucking loud waiting to
get on a plane and it was kind of 

907
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,280
annoying.
It's fucking annoying as shit,

908
00:38:11,281 --> 00:38:12,870
man.
You can have a normal conversation.

909
00:38:12,871 --> 00:38:14,940
Just put that fucking thing up.
Do you usually cover?

910
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:18,280
Usually cover my mouth with my hand.
I don't want people to,

911
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,130
to.
This is a big difference between someone

912
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:20,880
sitting there going,
hey,

913
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:21,450
yeah,
what's up?

914
00:38:21,451 --> 00:38:21,870
What's going on?

915
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,220
How are you doing?
And someone going,

916
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:23,940
Yo,
what's up?

917
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:25,140
What's going on?
What are you doing?

918
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,730
Okay.
And then what happens?

919
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,960
And then the other person,
the other,

920
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,410
we're going to come down there,
right?

921
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,840
I have to listen to your shit,
man.

922
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,520
This is loud.
Maybe she just does it around me now.

923
00:38:36,521 --> 00:38:39,850
I'm kind of paranoid that I said because
I'm like,

924
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:41,230
wait,
does it by herself?

925
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,300
Maybe.
I don't know if she only does.

926
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:48,420
She does it around me a lot.
Maybe it's a security thing where she 

927
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:48,420
wants to do like,
Hey,

928
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,810
I'm talking to this guy.
You know what I mean?

929
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,210
Yeah.
I'm not hiding this around.

930
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:55,990
Yeah.
Maybe just being respectful.

931
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,370
Yeah.
I should start doing it around here.

932
00:38:57,371 --> 00:38:59,860
I guess.
Just can't be that though.

933
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:02,170
It can't be that because there was no 
way.

934
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:07,350
We've got a tricky thing in this world 
about people being too fucking 

935
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:07,350
sensitive.

936
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:10,770
There's a lot of to fucking sensitive 
people that can't take a joke or even 

937
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:11,750
take a a conversation.
How about this?

938
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:16,751
There's Michelle Obama.
Obama's wife is a apparently the center 

939
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:18,900
of controversy because she shook a 
dude's hand.

940
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:23,140
She's in Indonesia and there's a Muslim 
dude there and they were saying hello,

941
00:39:23,141 --> 00:39:24,850
you know,
some and some dignitaries,

942
00:39:24,851 --> 00:39:27,570
and she shook his hand and it's like all
over the news.

943
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,260
So retarded.
It's all over the news.

944
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:34,590
Oh,
I was mad she was being nice to 

945
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:34,590
somebody.
Oh yeah.

946
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:34,590
The,
the Muslims.

947
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,490
They're losing their fucking mind.
I can't wait.

948
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:38,050
Muslims are losing them.
Very upset.

949
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,240
I think I pulled it up.
But um,

950
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,130
anyway,
the fucking story is,

951
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:43,420
it's very simple.
Here it is.

952
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:46,270
Michelle Obama shakes hands with 
Indonesian information.

953
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:51,271
Minister.
Try saying this dude's name took a 

954
00:39:51,271 --> 00:39:55,360
darker too fat to some ring as Obama 
arrived in Jakarta and Indonesia.

955
00:39:58,751 --> 00:40:03,460
Apparently conservative Muslim minister 
and didn't Nisha who is being criticized

956
00:40:03,461 --> 00:40:08,461
for shaking hands with Michelle Obama,
thus violating his pious claim that he 

957
00:40:08,461 --> 00:40:11,800
avoids contact with women not related to
him as you know,

958
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,490
as you're supposed to do.
And some sex of Islam.

959
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,250
What the fuck man?
Two thousand 10.

960
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,430
Dude,
this is in the news.

961
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,880
Some woman's shook a dude's hand.
You know what the fuck man.

962
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,580
What?
He just wanted to touch.

963
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,870
Get something that's touched Obama's 
Dick.

964
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:26,930
You think so?
Yeah.

965
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,040
He went into connection like a Kevin 
Bacon connection to Obama's Dick.

966
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,960
That is what you get to shake her hand,
right?

967
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,790
Yeah.
You get it off the way.

968
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,460
We get it all.
You get the whole package.

969
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:42,250
What would we.
What if she became president one day?

970
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:45,760
Michelle Obama would be fucking awesome.
Kinda of chicken.

971
00:40:45,761 --> 00:40:47,380
The aunties black.
A black,

972
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,740
beautiful,
beautiful.

973
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:54,150
If she could be running shit.
If she was an exceptional person to run 

974
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:54,150
shit,
I'd be down.

975
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:58,890
You know the thing about chicks running 
shit as though they have to be really 

976
00:40:58,890 --> 00:40:59,860
good at running shit.
They can't just be hot.

977
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,110
That's the problem with this fucking 
Sarah Pailin things.

978
00:41:02,111 --> 00:41:07,111
All these faggots out there to think 
that she's good enough to be president 

979
00:41:07,111 --> 00:41:07,660
because they want to fuck her.
I was talking about this on stage.

980
00:41:07,661 --> 00:41:12,661
They think that life is like a fucking 
Kevin Bacon movie where you're the last 

981
00:41:12,661 --> 00:41:12,661
vote that counts,
you know,

982
00:41:12,661 --> 00:41:17,221
and then she finds out that you're the 
one who got her elected presidents and 

983
00:41:17,221 --> 00:41:17,221
she comes to meet you and an unlikely 
romance blossom.

984
00:41:17,221 --> 00:41:22,161
So now there's a lot of idiots that are 
willing to vote for Pailin because they 

985
00:41:22,161 --> 00:41:23,200
really do think she's hot.
But I mean,

986
00:41:23,201 --> 00:41:24,580
you know,
if you can get some genius,

987
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:27,340
brilliant woman to be running shit,
I'd be just as Dan.

988
00:41:27,341 --> 00:41:29,140
Would that be a dumb bench?
No,

989
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,440
no.
She's never going to become president in

990
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,340
Pailin.
No.

991
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:33,410
Well,
you know what?

992
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:33,980
I wouldn't

993
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,980
say never dude,
because I would've never believed she 

994
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,440
would have the following that she has.
But everyone knows everyone that has had

995
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:44,441
a tv for the last year and a half,
two years have seen every single skit 

996
00:41:44,441 --> 00:41:45,500
with her.
And even if you like her,

997
00:41:45,501 --> 00:41:48,470
you have that in the back of your mind.
Only you do.

998
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:53,530
You're not retarded dude.
Fifty plus percent of this country is 

999
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:57,941
almost retarded.
There's a giant number of people that 

1000
00:41:57,941 --> 00:41:59,360
are so fucking dump that there could be 
some other issue.

1001
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:01,100
Look,
how about this Jan brewer chick?

1002
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,530
Do you know who she is?
She's a woman who was a.

1003
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:08,770
She was made governor of Arizona because
the original governor left and went to 

1004
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,890
what?
What is her name?

1005
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:12,260
I forgot what to the Obama campaign.
Anyway,

1006
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:15,140
the point is this Jan brewer,
woman is nuts.

1007
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:20,260
She's not an old and can't fucking talk,
and she goes on these debates and she 

1008
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,810
paused.

1009
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,960
She went on to debate.
She's debating with this other guy's 

1010
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:25,960
running for governor.
She pause for 10 seconds,

1011
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,220
said nothing,
just a stammering and not knowing what 

1012
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,940
to do and moving your hands and shit.
She had a full brain lock.

1013
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:37,150
This bitch lied about there being dead 
bodies on the Mexican border with their 

1014
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:38,450
heads chopped off,
and then everybody went,

1015
00:42:38,451 --> 00:42:39,440
well,
where are the bodies?

1016
00:42:39,441 --> 00:42:41,030
Like,
where's the autopsy reports?

1017
00:42:41,031 --> 00:42:46,031
Where's the police reports?
And it turns out it was all just 

1018
00:42:46,031 --> 00:42:48,550
horseshit.
She lied about her fucking father dying 

1019
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:48,550
in World War II.
She said,

1020
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:49,790
my father died defending on that.
No,

1021
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:51,450
she didn't.
He didn't die in world war two.

1022
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,550
He didn't.
She made it up.

1023
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,000
Who died during World War II?
We didn't leave.

1024
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,620
He's still alive.
That was the guy was alive.

1025
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,760
Still alive,
still alive in his silence piece of his 

1026
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,650
soul died.
Dumb cunt.

1027
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,440
More likely.

1028
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,030
Now she's the.
She won.

1029
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:11,210
And you know why she won?
Because she supports this crazy new 

1030
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:14,381
immigration law.
She wants to keep all the Mexicans out 

1031
00:43:14,381 --> 00:43:14,381
of Arizona.
Hey,

1032
00:43:14,381 --> 00:43:16,710
and most of Arizona is white people,
most of us owners,

1033
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:19,340
crazy old white people.
And they're like,

1034
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:22,160
no,
fuck that Arizona's and nutty place,

1035
00:43:22,161 --> 00:43:23,690
man.
We have a good time there because people

1036
00:43:23,691 --> 00:43:28,691
like to party and you know,
the shows are always fun there and 

1037
00:43:28,691 --> 00:43:28,691
people are always looking for fun stuff 
too.

1038
00:43:28,691 --> 00:43:32,560
But if you look at Arizona as a state,
like it's kind of a wonky fucking state 

1039
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:32,560
man.
Totally.

1040
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,260
You're allowed to just have guns there,
dude.

1041
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,380
You can just be walking around with a 
gun in your pocket.

1042
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:39,950
You have to with all the Mexicans,
they got guns.

1043
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:40,640
Ladies,
gentleman,

1044
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:45,670
Eddie Bravo is Mexican.
So before you start fucking firing up 

1045
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,690
your pen and getting crazy with your 
hate mail and firing up your twitter,

1046
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:51,040
it's totally okay.
I could fucking make fun of Burritos.

1047
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:56,130
Own.
Do you have anybody that you follow it 

1048
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:57,811
on twitter that you're following?
Just because they're dumb that you can 

1049
00:43:57,911 --> 00:43:59,020
talk about?
No,

1050
00:43:59,021 --> 00:44:00,160
not that I can say.
Oh well,

1051
00:44:00,161 --> 00:44:01,500
you know.
No.

1052
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:02,650
Yeah,
you got to be nice,

1053
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:05,430
right?
Yes.

1054
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:10,740
I like,
I like ridiculously dumb tweets or funny

1055
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:16,080
tweets that inbetween shit.
I'm not into like that would just tweet 

1056
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:20,080
motivational shit that they've heard 
like,

1057
00:44:20,081 --> 00:44:22,120
come on now.
I'm not for that shit.

1058
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:27,580
I love motivational ones.
I love like dudes who are like older who

1059
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,680
give advice like Steve Harvey's my 
current favorite.

1060
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:32,220
Check this shit out as a tweet.

1061
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,480
I save them.
I save his tweets.

1062
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,990
Your relationship with a man is either 
off or on.

1063
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:40,110
It cannot be off and on.
Ladies.

1064
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:43,680
You have the power stop allowing the 
back and forth.

1065
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:46,260
Damn.
He's like a black doctor film.

1066
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,980
Well first of all,
how do you know that?

1067
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:51,630
The chickens and just looking to get 
some Dick,

1068
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,800
right?
Yeah,

1069
00:44:52,801 --> 00:44:54,390
it's off and on.
People are crazy,

1070
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:56,080
man.
I ain't gonna always work out the trick.

1071
00:44:56,081 --> 00:44:58,200
He's trying to get bitches.
Let's trying to get them to like him.

1072
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,220
Appear sensitive.
Right?

1073
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,260
So it is totally.
Heres another one.

1074
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,570
Good morning.
God will perform the unexpected time and

1075
00:45:06,571 --> 00:45:09,990
time again.
If you just let him talk to God.

1076
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:11,700
Don't be too proud to pray.

1077
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:16,810
How many followers does he prayed right 
after?

1078
00:45:16,811 --> 00:45:18,360
I heard that.
How many followers is.

1079
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:20,910
Yeah know he's got a lot.
Steve Farber was a famous guy.

1080
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,950
He's good.
So 100,000

1081
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,910
probably something like that.
Now I just hit 200,000

1082
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:31,020
pants.
That's something to me.

1083
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:34,860
How many a day do you get normally?
Like adders few hundred.

1084
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,820
Few hundred?
Yeah.

1085
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:37,950
I liked how it continues.
Once you get to a certain point,

1086
00:45:37,951 --> 00:45:40,590
you notice that you get an average of 
like a certain amount per day.

1087
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,990
Only have 16,000.
I treated like,

1088
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:43,590
you know,
I,

1089
00:45:43,591 --> 00:45:44,980
I look uh,
treated like a,

1090
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:48,610
like a little platform,
like a little comedy,

1091
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,450
Farmville world,
you know what I mean?

1092
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:55,460
There's a lot of times where I'd get on 
there and I just promote gigs or a lot 

1093
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:59,151
of times I find like cool shit,
but I found in line like that I'm a 

1094
00:45:59,151 --> 00:46:02,361
Italian song or that American guy or the
Italian guy was speaking of seeing an 

1095
00:46:02,361 --> 00:46:02,730
American accent.

1096
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:04,380
Like what,
what it was like jibberish.

1097
00:46:04,381 --> 00:46:06,470
He wasn't real American words,
but what he thought.

1098
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,480
Can you find that here?
This is what I would love to hear that 

1099
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,291
and just someone making fun of an 
American accent but not really using 

1100
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:14,291
really interesting.
Yeah,

1101
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:18,430
it's really interesting.
It's kind of a cool song and if you see 

1102
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:18,800
the video but that like up to eat shit 
like that or science tweets.

1103
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,430
I was going to tweet something today,
you know,

1104
00:46:20,431 --> 00:46:25,431
they fired up the large Hadron collider 
and made thousands of little big bangs 

1105
00:46:25,431 --> 00:46:25,431
there.
Started doing that.

1106
00:46:25,431 --> 00:46:25,740
Man,
that's,

1107
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:27,510
that's become a,
become a reality.

1108
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:32,540
They're really doing it now.
So they have all these photos at the 

1109
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:32,540
lab.
It's fascinating.

1110
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,410
Fascinating fucking shit man.
You know.

1111
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,940
But you know,
so there's that.

1112
00:46:35,941 --> 00:46:40,941
I do.
And then also like I treat it like a 

1113
00:46:40,941 --> 00:46:40,941
little audience,
you know,

1114
00:46:40,941 --> 00:46:41,670
I think you've got to give people things
man,

1115
00:46:41,671 --> 00:46:46,671
when you,
when you're looking to promote gigs and 

1116
00:46:46,671 --> 00:46:46,671
use the internet and shit like this,
you know,

1117
00:46:46,671 --> 00:46:48,660
you can't just promote you gotta you 
gotta give him some shit too.

1118
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,880
So like the other day I was watching 
ancient aliens.

1119
00:46:50,881 --> 00:46:55,870
I spent like a whole hour just tweeting,
talking shit on h and aliens that gather

1120
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,900
new season.
So bad.

1121
00:46:57,990 --> 00:46:59,400
Well,
the first season was incredible.

1122
00:46:59,401 --> 00:47:01,360
The first season is awesome.
They ran out of.

1123
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,290
They're trying to,
you know,

1124
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:05,760
it was,
it was crazy.

1125
00:47:05,761 --> 00:47:09,060
All the shit that we're saying,
but if you look at it this way,

1126
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:11,410
if you're,
if you don't believe in Ufos,

1127
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:15,510
then that sounds ridiculous.
But if you do believe,

1128
00:47:15,511 --> 00:47:19,380
if you watched the disclosure project 
and you listen to all the courses,

1129
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,950
testimony,
the guy who used to work for the.

1130
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:25,080
We used to be in the Pentagon and 
fucking head of nuclear energy in Europe

1131
00:47:25,081 --> 00:47:28,080
and all that shit when,
when you hear his confessions and like,

1132
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:30,160
like the deathbed confession of General 
Ramy

1133
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,410
and,
and just if you,

1134
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:36,690
if you,
if you believe in Ufos than fucking 

1135
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,380
anything as possible,
then that means they must have been here

1136
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:44,010
several times at least.
And if there were around during the 

1137
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:44,050
Greek time,
they must have tripped out on them.

1138
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:47,200
That must've been a big news like these 
motherfuckers.

1139
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,710
And they must have like talked to drew 
about,

1140
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:51,530
uh,
uh,

1141
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:52,260
you know,
uh,

1142
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:54,100
painted about it,
talked about it,

1143
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:58,660
wrote some scripture about or something.
And it's not that far fetched,

1144
00:47:58,661 --> 00:48:02,020
but that come into some like ridiculous 
conclusions like about,

1145
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:06,190
like the paintings in India that maybe 
this was an alien,

1146
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:09,460
will the Mahabharata the,
that's a fascinating text.

1147
00:48:09,461 --> 00:48:12,480
The ancient texts of ancient hinduism is
a,

1148
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:15,530
is riddled with stories of,
of flying things and,

1149
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:18,820
and you know,
things that flew through the air.

1150
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:22,210
But you also have to realize that these 
people took a lot of drugs.

1151
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:24,670
These people were in the heavy 
psychedelic drugs.

1152
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:29,870
I mean Mana to the ancient Hindu tax.
They believe it's some sort of a 

1153
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:32,790
combination of psilocybin mushrooms and 
a bunch of other different things.

1154
00:48:32,791 --> 00:48:34,810
There's a bunch of debate about what 
Mana is,

1155
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:39,990
but it's very clear that they were 
referencing something that connected 

1156
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:43,801
them to the psychedelic world.
And if it was something that connected 

1157
00:48:43,801 --> 00:48:44,140
them to the psychedelic world,
you know,

1158
00:48:44,141 --> 00:48:46,480
and I know you're going to see some 
shit.

1159
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,000
It doesn't mean that the shit you're 
seeing is not real.

1160
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,360
You know,
when you see the,

1161
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:52,150
like when people think of 
hallucinations,

1162
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:57,390
like you think of,
oh you took a drug and you saw a monkey 

1163
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:57,390
that wasn't really there and he,
you know,

1164
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:58,930
you know,
you think of something fake,

1165
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:04,320
but what you see a lot of times when you
take psychedelics drugs is not like the 

1166
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,290
rest of the world.

1167
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:07,690
And then all of a sudden some new fake 
thing shows up.

1168
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:12,900
It shows you like a whole new world.
It shows you like a whole hallucination 

1169
00:49:13,061 --> 00:49:16,510
world which may or may not be real.
You know,

1170
00:49:16,511 --> 00:49:17,130
what,
what,

1171
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:22,220
what might be happening when you take 
like big doses of any crazy drug as you 

1172
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:23,980
might be tuning into the next door 
neighbor channel.

1173
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:25,450
You know,
there might be the whole world,

1174
00:49:25,451 --> 00:49:28,270
might be a fucking radio,
have a million different channels and we

1175
00:49:28,271 --> 00:49:29,540
might be on,
you know,

1176
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,150
1:06
point four.

1177
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:33,670
And there's a 100,
six point five and it's right next door.

1178
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:35,260
And when you take mushrooms you go 
there.

1179
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:36,760
You know.
So you know,

1180
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:41,970
these guys saying that they saw these 
flying things and talking about all 

1181
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:45,931
these majestic beings with all this 
wisdom that very easily could have been 

1182
00:49:46,121 --> 00:49:48,130
drugs very easily.
It could be.

1183
00:49:48,131 --> 00:49:49,300
That could,
it could be both.

1184
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:54,360
I mean just because you have a 
psychedelic experience doesn't mean 

1185
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:54,940
that.
I mean that very,

1186
00:49:55,210 --> 00:50:00,210
very.
I don't know how much I believe very 

1187
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:03,850
skeptical about crafts from another 
planet that come here that are metal and

1188
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,580
the traditional idea of like,
you know,

1189
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:09,460
just doing a super advanced version of 
what we already do.

1190
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:12,100
I look at that and I go,
I don't think so.

1191
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:14,700
This just seems too silly.
It seems to.

1192
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:16,700
Mechanic testimony did.
Yeah.

1193
00:50:16,701 --> 00:50:18,070
But it doesn't matter.
It's a lot of testimony.

1194
00:50:18,071 --> 00:50:23,071
People being raped by demons.
You can go back in time and find 

1195
00:50:23,071 --> 00:50:23,890
thousands of Napa who.
But it's not your size.

1196
00:50:23,891 --> 00:50:28,891
Yeah.
But these people which try and keep on 

1197
00:50:28,891 --> 00:50:30,290
organizing and getting in front of the 
Washington DC and the national press and

1198
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:33,540
they don't have credible witness like 
hundreds of them and Philip course.

1199
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:36,500
So on all these guys that like in their 
death bed,

1200
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:39,290
like you watched the testimonies like,
do you think these guys are lying?

1201
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:46,180
That's true.
But it doesn't necessarily mean that 

1202
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:46,180
they are telling the truth.
It might mean they're wrong.

1203
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,900
It might mean that there's some crazy 
government experiments that they don't.

1204
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:49,280
They're not really sure.
I believe in that.

1205
00:50:49,281 --> 00:50:52,490
I believe there's definitely a lot of 
this shit.

1206
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,870
Maybe most of the shit that people see 
and report our,

1207
00:50:55,900 --> 00:51:00,900
our own government make and shape.
But if you listen to Philip Corso 

1208
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:00,900
testimony,
he's saying yes.

1209
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:05,710
A lot of that shit is our shit to say 
that he saw things himself personally.

1210
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:06,800
Yes,
he did.

1211
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,020
Phil,
of course.

1212
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:12,020
So was this part of Roswell right?
He wasn't at Roswell,

1213
00:51:12,021 --> 00:51:14,270
but he was involved in the shipping and 
stuff.

1214
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:19,271
He said he saw the bodies.
He said that he was intrinsically saw 

1215
00:51:19,271 --> 00:51:20,570
them or saw them.
He saw that.

1216
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,760
He said he opened the coffin song and 
said,

1217
00:51:22,761 --> 00:51:24,500
Oh shit.
And He.

1218
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:29,590
He knew so much that he was in charge of
taking crashed Ufo shit and taking it 

1219
00:51:31,191 --> 00:51:32,150
to,
this is what he said,

1220
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:37,390
taking it to like Hughes aircraft and 
Mcdonald Douglas getting reverse 

1221
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:37,390
engineer.

1222
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:41,450
Fascinating story about Roswell and 
everybody thinks at Roswell's a silly 

1223
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:42,980
stupid story and no one knows exactly 
what happened.

1224
00:51:42,981 --> 00:51:45,530
It could have been some sort of a Soviet
craft that crashed,

1225
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:50,950
but the fascinating part is that they 
flew the wreckage and two separate 

1226
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:52,970
planes because they wanted to make sure 
of one plane crash.

1227
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:58,210
They had a good chance that the other 
plane would make it to Wright Patterson 

1228
00:51:58,210 --> 00:51:59,660
air force base and they made sure they 
separated the wreckage.

1229
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:04,210
There's just so much evidence.
Even like today with like the chain,

1230
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:09,240
the China Shanghai airport or an airport
in China closed down twice within a few 

1231
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:12,770
months because there were some shit 
right over the airport.

1232
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,660
They didn't know what it was.
They shut everything down.

1233
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:17,420
I mean just shit like that all over the 
world.

1234
00:52:17,421 --> 00:52:19,370
I mean there's.
So there's actually is evidence.

1235
00:52:19,371 --> 00:52:22,070
I mean people are put away for life with
no video,

1236
00:52:22,071 --> 00:52:23,330
no pictures of the crime.

1237
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,460
Just testimony,
man,

1238
00:52:25,461 --> 00:52:30,461
they're just listening to that testimony
and putting people away for multiple 

1239
00:52:30,461 --> 00:52:32,270
life sentences.
When you put all the evidence together,

1240
00:52:32,271 --> 00:52:34,960
just look up Phillip Corso with the sea.
What?

1241
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:37,270
There's hours and hours of him just 
talking about.

1242
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:40,250
He wrote a book about it before he was.
He was an old motherfucker.

1243
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:45,280
He was on dateline and shit.
I think an even more compelling one is 

1244
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:50,230
Dr j Dot Allen Hynek exactly.
Was Working on project Blue Book and he 

1245
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:55,601
was assigned to discredit ufo stories.
He what his job was as he explained it 

1246
00:52:56,991 --> 00:53:01,991
was when he would hear about something,
he would come up with a reason that it 

1247
00:53:01,991 --> 00:53:01,991
was something else.
Swamp,

1248
00:53:01,991 --> 00:53:04,460
swamp gas or circular ball,
lightning.

1249
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:06,470
All this different.
She was hired for that by the government

1250
00:53:06,471 --> 00:53:11,471
like in the fifties and sixties.
And then when project blue book shut 

1251
00:53:11,471 --> 00:53:14,501
down,
he dedicated his entire life to 

1252
00:53:14,501 --> 00:53:14,600
investigating you,
fos and enlightening people on it.

1253
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:16,400
Totally.
And he talks about it.

1254
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:21,401
I mean there's interviews,
he's like ours and then there's like a 

1255
00:53:21,401 --> 00:53:24,041
new theory.
Now the new theory is that the 

1256
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:26,490
government wants everyone to believe in 
Ufos.

1257
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,220
To keep their projects under wrap,
like they're black projects under wrap.

1258
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:31,240
I'm like,
what?

1259
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:36,280
What is,
what was this project blue book and all 

1260
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:36,280
this stuff or whatever saying that it 
was swamp gas number.

1261
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,370
Trying to calm everybody down.
Why were they lying?

1262
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:39,930
I mean they would have just said,
yeah,

1263
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:42,390
you know what?
We don't know what it is.

1264
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,630
It's probably from another galaxy,
but we don't know,

1265
00:53:45,631 --> 00:53:48,360
but what we assure you we're going to do
whatever it takes to protect you.

1266
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,210
If they really wanted people to believe 
in the,

1267
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:51,990
they'd be saying that shit not cover it 
up.

1268
00:53:51,991 --> 00:53:56,070
So I mean if you look up,
look at the Phillip Corso testimony.

1269
00:53:56,350 --> 00:54:01,350
Look at the disclosure project.
There's already been at least two of 

1270
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:01,350
them.
I mean these,

1271
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:05,810
there's so much credible and like,
like the top scientists of Europe all 

1272
00:54:06,301 --> 00:54:08,520
got together.
I forget what the committee is called.

1273
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:13,660
International Group was.
They came together in France and they 

1274
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:17,571
looked at all the Ufo testimony and all 
the shit and they said 15 percent.

1275
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:23,870
It's probably beans from another galaxy 
or another solar system.

1276
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:29,270
That's what they said.
All of them could have been explained 

1277
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:29,270
away,
but the 15 percent they said,

1278
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:35,720
this is probably,
I would not conclude that it was 

1279
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,690
something from this earth that we 
haven't discovered yet.

1280
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,400
They,
especially when you look at the ocean,

1281
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,030
well this is what they concluded.
They concluded that all the other ship,

1282
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:45,240
85 percent of all the shit that like 
that could be me,

1283
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:46,890
that could be manmade,
that could be this.

1284
00:54:46,891 --> 00:54:49,230
This is probably some reflection off the
sun.

1285
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:54,590
Fifteen percent.
They said the most likely because based 

1286
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:57,780
on the pictures and the way that they 
got some shit from satellite pictures of

1287
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:01,830
craft coming from the top down that they
couldn't explain it and they're like,

1288
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,230
man,
what the fuck are moving?

1289
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:09,880
You know that weird shit of things 
moving and then changing angles and 

1290
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:10,680
changing direction and moving another 
way.

1291
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,200
The big,
the bigger incident that happened at the

1292
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:19,400
US military installation in the UK where
there's an 80 motherfuckers that saw 

1293
00:55:19,471 --> 00:55:24,471
this aircraft,
three of them came up to it as it was 

1294
00:55:24,471 --> 00:55:24,471
parked.
They touched it.

1295
00:55:24,471 --> 00:55:25,540
They took notes that are on the 
disclosure possibility.

1296
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:28,620
Three of them went up to it and 80 of 
them were all around going,

1297
00:55:28,621 --> 00:55:31,140
Holy Shit.
That's possible that it was a drone.

1298
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,630
That's possible,
that it was something from America.

1299
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:37,110
When they set it to God disappeared.
It was gone.

1300
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:38,730
When I said,
if you have a drone,

1301
00:55:38,731 --> 00:55:43,731
I mean,
especially if we're talking about 

1302
00:55:43,731 --> 00:55:43,731
different alternative sources of power,
we don't know none of those.

1303
00:55:43,731 --> 00:55:46,170
None of those motherfuckers and and it 
came back.

1304
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:51,320
They sent a guy to look into it and that
guy's in the disclosure project to like 

1305
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:55,611
two days later they sent the guy to calm
everyone down and they came back and 

1306
00:55:55,611 --> 00:55:57,750
they saw it and these guys are the and 
the.

1307
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:00,980
When the military,
the UK embassy,

1308
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,670
The d,
the Ministry of Defense,

1309
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,670
they're there.
When the.

1310
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:07,710
They came up to them and ask them,
what are we going to do about this?

1311
00:56:07,711 --> 00:56:08,910
What was that?
They go,

1312
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,660
this doesn't.
If it doesn't concern national security,

1313
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:17,720
we're not getting involved.
That doesn't sucker and we feel that it 

1314
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:17,970
doesn't,
it doesn't.

1315
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:19,860
But here's the problem with this whole 
story.

1316
00:56:19,861 --> 00:56:20,820
Okay?
You weren't there.

1317
00:56:20,821 --> 00:56:25,821
I wasn't there.
We're just talking about what we heard 

1318
00:56:25,821 --> 00:56:25,821
people talking about.
We don't

1319
00:56:25,821 --> 00:56:27,340
know exactly what went down and until 
you talk to these people,

1320
00:56:27,341 --> 00:56:28,690
you don't know how many of them are full
of shit.

1321
00:56:28,691 --> 00:56:31,470
How many of them are exaggerating,
how many of them were traumatized?

1322
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:33,820
That's why I say based on the shit that 
you see,

1323
00:56:33,821 --> 00:56:36,670
if you actually look into it and then 
you make the judgment,

1324
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,020
you're making the judgment.
Damn.

1325
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:41,050
You know,
if you haven't seen the testimony,

1326
00:56:41,051 --> 00:56:41,700
then yeah,
you don't.

1327
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:43,390
We don't know what what he said or it 
doesn't.

1328
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,540
It doesn't matter.
It's all on testimony.

1329
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,720
When you're basing on the testimony,
you don't know anything about these 

1330
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,821
people.
You never know how much of it you're 

1331
00:56:53,821 --> 00:56:53,821
getting square with 80 and this is what 
they said to.

1332
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,920
They said the response to the British 
Ministry of Defense saying,

1333
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:02,470
if it doesn't,
if it doesn't concern national security,

1334
00:57:02,471 --> 00:57:04,690
we're not going to get involved.
Then 80,

1335
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:09,430
80 people fucking hallucinated that and 
then it got 80 people,

1336
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:10,990
80 people that are full of shit.

1337
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:13,390
They got 80 bit needed as neither it 
means neither.

1338
00:57:13,391 --> 00:57:18,391
That's not true.
If it means that 80 people were not 

1339
00:57:18,391 --> 00:57:18,430
aware of what they were looking at,
that's all it means.

1340
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:22,900
If they're trained to observe them,
they're in the military,

1341
00:57:22,901 --> 00:57:27,901
doesn't mean anything.
If the military people that are in the 

1342
00:57:27,901 --> 00:57:31,021
know,
the people that are there at the scene 

1343
00:57:31,021 --> 00:57:33,091
of the crime or the senior landing,
if they're not aware of the technology 

1344
00:57:33,091 --> 00:57:33,760
that's available to the highest levels 
of government,

1345
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:36,340
they're not aware of whatever 
experimental shit they're working on.

1346
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:41,520
It might as well be from another planet,
so what are they going to say if they 

1347
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,370
don't know about horse?
Of course nobody knows.

1348
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:47,460
Nobody was there,
but to make a judgment based on the 

1349
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:47,830
testimony,
you can totally not believe in God.

1350
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:49,720
You know what?
I don't believe these guys.

1351
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:54,750
Or You could look at it and say,
I'm going to look at what the open mind 

1352
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:54,750
fuck 80 dudes that are trained 
observers.

1353
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,640
Three went up to it and touched it.
They sat there saying,

1354
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:01,420
it's out of this fucking world.
Definitely they're saying it.

1355
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:06,630
That's what they're in the military.
The British Ministry of Defense is 

1356
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:10,690
fucking not even looking into it at all.
I mean to the conclusion are you,

1357
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:14,770
but it's still a bunch of people's 
testimonies about something they saw and

1358
00:58:14,771 --> 00:58:19,771
then you might not have known what they 
were seeing and then you add all the 

1359
00:58:19,771 --> 00:58:20,140
shit around.
That's just one incident.

1360
00:58:20,141 --> 00:58:23,280
Then you look at all of it,
you connect all the dots and you,

1361
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,570
you know,
you can make a decision.

1362
00:58:25,571 --> 00:58:26,770
And my decision,
Mike,

1363
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:31,860
is that there's some shit going on.
That's how I feel based on our decision 

1364
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:35,761
is not that at all.
My decision as is as there's a lot of 

1365
00:58:35,761 --> 00:58:38,290
people with a lot of stories and we know
for a fact that there are a fuck load of

1366
00:58:38,291 --> 00:58:43,291
experimental government aircrafts that 
they use for sure they're manned or 

1367
00:58:43,511 --> 00:58:46,120
whether they're remote control and you 
know,

1368
00:58:46,121 --> 00:58:48,970
all these people are just telling their 
version of a story.

1369
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:53,970
Something that they saw.
I believe they saw something I do not 

1370
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:54,490
believe that they know is from another 
world.

1371
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:56,590
So them even saying it was from another 
world.

1372
00:58:56,591 --> 00:59:01,591
People want shit to be romantic.
They want shit to be little gray man to 

1373
00:59:01,591 --> 00:59:06,091
come here and spaceships from palladium 
is wherever the fuck they are coming 

1374
00:59:06,091 --> 00:59:06,190
from the galaxy.
They want that.

1375
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:11,220
They look for that shit.
Fall in love and that's all true what 

1376
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:11,570
you're saying,
but you don't believe that there's Ufo.

1377
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,940
What is this believe,
man?

1378
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:14,920
You either believe me.
Don't believe that's not true.

1379
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:16,840
Absolutely not true.
That is not true.

1380
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:21,980
We do not have to believe you're right 
in the middle real or something's not 

1381
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:21,980
real.
You just go.

1382
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,840
I don't know because that's the only 
rational explanation.

1383
00:59:23,841 --> 00:59:28,841
Yeah,
but you can't say you believe because 

1384
00:59:28,841 --> 00:59:30,731
when you believe it,
throw everything else out the out the 

1385
00:59:30,731 --> 00:59:30,731
door.

1386
00:59:30,731 --> 00:59:30,731
You said,
well,

1387
00:59:30,731 --> 00:59:30,940
this is the.
I believe there are Ufos.

1388
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:33,440
I believe that aliens have landed here.
I don't believe that.

1389
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:34,700
I don't believe we.
No,

1390
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:40,000
I don't believe that.
We're absolutely convinced and I don't 

1391
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,031
believe that you believe.
Can you believe that Philip Corso was a 

1392
00:59:43,031 --> 00:59:44,000
crazy man and it was full of Shit.
What do you do as adding words?

1393
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:47,150
So what I'm saying,
12 year old ship based on.

1394
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:49,660
Based on what you saw from Phillip 
Course leave,

1395
00:59:49,661 --> 00:59:54,661
he's out there sucking cock and take it 
in the ass and he's doing drugs and he 

1396
00:59:54,661 --> 00:59:54,680
didn't even know what he was saying.
How about that?

1397
00:59:54,681 --> 00:59:57,160
Is that better?
I'm just trying to get courses.

1398
00:59:57,170 --> 01:00:02,170
Just a guy man.
I mean he's a guy that said he saw some 

1399
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:02,170
bodies and he's a guy that used to work 
for the military.

1400
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:03,600
Is he credible?
The Pentagon?

1401
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:06,830
He was head of head of nuclear energy in
Europe.

1402
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:11,920
Okay.
George Bush was the president and he's 

1403
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:11,920
an idiot.
Does it matter?

1404
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:11,930
Does it matter?
Like how high he got up there?

1405
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:17,050
It's very clear to me that the entire 
government is riddled with fucking 

1406
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:17,720
idiots.
There's idiots all over the place.

1407
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:18,800
It.
Was He an idiot?

1408
01:00:18,801 --> 01:00:21,050
I don't think so.
He seemed like an interesting guy.

1409
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,850
Did he see some shit?
I don't know.

1410
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:25,040
What did he see in those with those 
bodies?

1411
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:26,570
What were they?
Who the fuck knows?

1412
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:31,690
They might've been mutants.
They might've been fucking radiation 

1413
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:34,541
disasters.
They might've been a little children 

1414
01:00:34,541 --> 01:00:34,541
that had a disease.
I don't know.

1415
01:00:34,541 --> 01:00:36,320
I don't know how much you saw it.
I don't know how close he got to it.

1416
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:41,000
I don't know how much information he was
really truly pretty think Oj guilty.

1417
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:45,060
I don't know if Oj guilty,
I assuming.

1418
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:50,110
Yes.
There's a lot of evidence to dead 

1419
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:50,110
people,
knives,

1420
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:52,751
blood in his car.
It's a little different than some dude 

1421
01:00:52,751 --> 01:00:52,751
who says he saw a Ufo and doesn't know 
what it is,

1422
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:56,510
so why did they let him free?
What the fuck are we talking about?

1423
01:00:56,511 --> 01:00:57,390
Oj format.
Let's.

1424
01:00:57,490 --> 01:01:00,230
That's we're talking about evidence and 
testimony and all that stuff.

1425
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:02,960
That's what we're talking about.
A system is fucked up.

1426
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:07,990
That's why because black people thought 
that it was one on their side that they 

1427
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:09,260
were going to release him and if it did 
not fit,

1428
01:01:09,261 --> 01:01:14,261
you must acquit and they wanted to get 
back at the Rodney King verdict and so 

1429
01:01:14,261 --> 01:01:15,030
they released them.
That's why was not a Ufo ufs.

1430
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:20,100
You guys have like a,
like a couple that broke up and have 

1431
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:20,100
come together.
Careful.

1432
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:24,761
You have to be careful when you start 
talking about things that you haven't 

1433
01:01:24,761 --> 01:01:24,761
seen yourself.

1434
01:01:24,761 --> 01:01:25,730
This is just my opinion when the same 
way with you,

1435
01:01:25,731 --> 01:01:28,610
I.
I don't even if it was the most evidence

1436
01:01:28,611 --> 01:01:33,611
ever,
unless I knew for a fact I saw with my 

1437
01:01:33,611 --> 01:01:33,611
own eyes.
I just too much bullshit.

1438
01:01:33,611 --> 01:01:36,260
I don't follow anything.
Why stress out about it?

1439
01:01:36,310 --> 01:01:38,900
It's there's too much bullshit.
There's 20 people are full of Shit.

1440
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:42,350
Too many people exaggerate too many 
people twist the truth and there's a big

1441
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:46,110
business and talking about Ufos and 
that's another thing to be careful of.

1442
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:50,420
There's a gigantic business and writing 
books about this shit and doing lectures

1443
01:01:50,421 --> 01:01:53,690
and seminars and these guys make a 
fucking good living.

1444
01:01:53,691 --> 01:01:57,300
Traveling the country,
selling books and talking about Ufos.

1445
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:00,770
Whenever you involve commerce in a very 
strange discussion,

1446
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:05,950
like the discussion of the potential 
reality of our intelligent life from 

1447
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:10,511
other planets.
Whenever you involve money in that and 

1448
01:02:10,511 --> 01:02:10,511
money and then in the stories.

1449
01:02:10,511 --> 01:02:15,090
I mean,
then it becomes sort of a faction of 

1450
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:16,961
show business.
I mean Whitley strieber is one of the 

1451
01:02:16,961 --> 01:02:19,350
fucking biggest proponents of the alien 
abduction story and wrote books on it,

1452
01:02:19,351 --> 01:02:24,351
communion and had movies made about it 
and that guy is a fucking book writer.

1453
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,640
He writes books.
He makes fiction.

1454
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,880
He makes fiction and he created this 
whole thing about getting abducted by 

1455
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,690
UFOS and everybody took it as fact and 
man,

1456
01:02:33,691 --> 01:02:38,691
who the fuck knows of it's fact.
You got a guy who's a professional 

1457
01:02:38,691 --> 01:02:41,841
fiction man and you don't know.
You don't know what's going on in his 

1458
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:41,841
head.
In his head.

1459
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:45,110
There's no evidence.
It's like it's like there may be Ufo is.

1460
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:46,650
Absolutely.
There may be.

1461
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,170
There may be intelligent life from other
plants.

1462
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:50,700
Absolutely.
There may be,

1463
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,190
but you can't just jump on.
Yes.

1464
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:54,570
Because you jump on.
Yes.

1465
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:55,970
What did I just jumped on?

1466
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:56,810
Jumped on.
It did.

1467
01:02:56,811 --> 01:02:59,310
I didn't jump on it.
It's just so much research.

1468
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:01,260
I fucking.
I'm obsessed with you.

1469
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:03,690
I do a lot.
I didn't just jump on it.

1470
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:06,720
I listened to a lot of tests.
You said you jumped at,

1471
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,680
but I didn't just jump on it like you're
making it seem like you were like,

1472
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:12,390
I heard one testimony and that's not 
what I'm saying.

1473
01:03:12,391 --> 01:03:14,580
I'm saying you look,
if you listen to what I said,

1474
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:18,120
what I said was that you,
unless you experiencing it yourself,

1475
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:23,180
you don't know exactly what happened.
When you talking about people that are 

1476
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:24,180
talking about crafts that they think 
were from another world,

1477
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:27,120
you don't know where it really came from
and that gets very,

1478
01:03:27,121 --> 01:03:32,121
very tricky and if you choose to believe
or not to believe you're jumping on one 

1479
01:03:32,121 --> 01:03:32,520
side or another,
if you're saying,

1480
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:35,340
I don't think there's [inaudible],
I think everyone's full of shit.

1481
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:36,840
You're sick,
you're jumping on.

1482
01:03:36,841 --> 01:03:37,920
No,
and if you say,

1483
01:03:37,921 --> 01:03:39,420
I do believe,
I believe you're here.

1484
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:40,650
You're jumping on.
Yes.

1485
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:43,440
Even if there's a lot of what you think 
is evidence,

1486
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:46,530
unless you're seeing it yourself,
unless it has been proven,

1487
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:49,320
which clearly hasn't.
It's clearly up for debate.

1488
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:51,030
Even though there's a bunch of people 
that come forward,

1489
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:53,430
whether there's 100 or a thousand and 
they say,

1490
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:55,680
I have crazy stories about things that 
move too fast.

1491
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:58,320
Who the fuck knows what that is?
Who knows?

1492
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:00,440
Okay.
You don't believe in your phones.

1493
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,630
Wow.
Wow.

1494
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:04,940
Dude,
are you.

1495
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:06,510
Are you kidding?
You're kidding.

1496
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:07,350
You're kidding,
right?

1497
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:10,320
I'm not kidding.
That's not what I'm saying.

1498
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:14,550
I'm not saying that I don't believe in 
your fault what I'm saying.

1499
01:04:14,551 --> 01:04:16,650
You don't know why no one knows nothing 
else.

1500
01:04:16,651 --> 01:04:17,550
No Man.
No,

1501
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:17,820
no,
no.

1502
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:19,800
That's what I'm saying.
Believe when you believe something,

1503
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,830
it's like you know,
for like based on the evidence,

1504
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:26,490
I believe there's some shit going on 
with other galaxies,

1505
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,650
so that's what I believe possible.

1506
01:04:28,770 --> 01:04:31,680
That there's life on other planets.
It's certainly possible.

1507
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:36,920
It's also possible that life is a dream.
It's also possible that your life is 

1508
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:41,120
imagination and you've made it all up 
and I'm a figment of your imagination 

1509
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:44,941
and each player is in your life to 
provide you with some information and 

1510
01:04:44,941 --> 01:04:45,870
try to help you and move you along in a 
certain way.

1511
01:04:45,871 --> 01:04:48,000
It's very possible that this life is not
even real.

1512
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:53,780
It's very possible that I'm in your 
imagination in urine mine and we sell 

1513
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:55,440
create because a lot of different 
possibilities that's possible,

1514
01:04:55,950 --> 01:05:00,950
but whether or not there's Ufo because 
some people that you don't know who 

1515
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:01,650
you've never met saw some things that 
you never saw and said.

1516
01:05:01,651 --> 01:05:03,990
They wrote it down and had conferences 
and discussions about.

1517
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:06,090
I don't know.
I don't know about that.

1518
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:13,190
Do you guys like sweet potato fries?
It's just,

1519
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:14,940
it's a tricky thing,
man.

1520
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:19,970
It's we attach ourselves to what we 
believe in and you obviously are getting

1521
01:05:20,771 --> 01:05:25,771
attached to this idea of being real 
because you've spent so much time 

1522
01:05:25,771 --> 01:05:27,040
invested,
so much time being fascinated by it,

1523
01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:32,870
fascinated with.
I'm fascinated with the testimony and 

1524
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:33,670
putting it all together.
You're making it sound like.

1525
01:05:33,671 --> 01:05:35,190
I'm like,
like mystic law.

1526
01:05:35,191 --> 01:05:40,191
I'm not man.
I'm not making a song that I am saying 

1527
01:05:40,191 --> 01:05:40,960
exactly what you're saying,
but what I am fascinated by people and I

1528
01:05:40,961 --> 01:05:45,961
know that people are full of shit and 
I'm not assuming that all these people 

1529
01:05:45,961 --> 01:05:49,861
are pious.
I'm not assuming that all these people 

1530
01:05:49,861 --> 01:05:51,901
are completely honest and without 
ulterior motive and telling you exactly 

1531
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:54,040
know as they saw it.
The truth.

1532
01:05:54,190 --> 01:05:59,190
I'm not seeing that.
I'm seeing a bunch of believers and 

1533
01:05:59,190 --> 01:05:59,190
that's the problem.

1534
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:00,910
Even if you saw something fucking 
completely insane,

1535
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,730
I don't want you telling me you know 
what it is.

1536
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:08,940
I don't want you describing it that way.
I want you saying I don't know what it 

1537
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:08,950
was.
I want you to say,

1538
01:06:08,951 --> 01:06:10,150
I think,
you know,

1539
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:13,540
it could've been some sort of a craft 
that I'm not aware of.

1540
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:17,260
It could be a Ufo means man and 
identified flying objects.

1541
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:19,120
You know,
you're not saying you,

1542
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:21,670
you're saying aliens,
right?

1543
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:23,050
Yes.
Well,

1544
01:06:23,051 --> 01:06:25,300
I'm not saying aliens.
I'm saying unknown.

1545
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:30,730
And when someone says they know and they
start talking about it being from 

1546
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:30,730
another planet,
bitch,

1547
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:34,711
do you have like some fucking serial 
numbers you can track back to this 

1548
01:06:34,711 --> 01:06:34,711
planet?
Like how do you know where it came from?

1549
01:06:34,711 --> 01:06:36,370
You don't know shit.
They're just taking a guess.

1550
01:06:36,371 --> 01:06:38,500
They see something in the sky.
I can't build.

1551
01:06:38,501 --> 01:06:39,730
It must be from space.

1552
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:42,010
I mean it's that simple.
It's not that simple.

1553
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:45,040
Like I go through that stuff.
It is that simple.

1554
01:06:45,041 --> 01:06:46,630
If you want to claim,
you know where it came from,

1555
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:47,440
man.
Okay.

1556
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:48,880
He can't.
No,

1557
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:49,840
you can't.
No,

1558
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:52,150
no one's saying they know.
If you don't know,

1559
01:06:52,151 --> 01:06:54,580
if you haven't seen it,
you don't know where it came from.

1560
01:06:54,581 --> 01:06:59,581
You haven't watched the video of it 
fucking flying off that planet and 

1561
01:06:59,581 --> 01:06:59,581
landing here.
Then it's digital.

1562
01:06:59,581 --> 01:07:02,260
A lot of fucking guesswork.
It's a romantic idea.

1563
01:07:02,261 --> 01:07:05,560
The idea seems so cool.
The idea that there's fucking alien.

1564
01:07:05,561 --> 01:07:07,810
It's tricky because you get sucked into 
it.

1565
01:07:07,811 --> 01:07:10,870
Like it seems so awesome.
So does the loch ness monster,

1566
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:16,140
you know,
it's like we have this built in shit in 

1567
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:18,301
our head.
It's nothing like the monster van 

1568
01:07:18,301 --> 01:07:21,100
lochness monster is like bigfoot.
Not bigfoot is a real animal.

1569
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:26,280
You know,
they have isolated in an animal called 

1570
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,711
gigantic [inaudible] that they believe 
if human beings came down to the bering 

1571
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:33,420
strait and they came from Asia,
gigantic [inaudible] lived in Asia as 

1572
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:33,790
recently as 10,000
years ago.

1573
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:37,420
It was a bipedal primate that was eight 
to 10 feet tall.

1574
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:40,510
So I believe in bigfoot.
It's an animal.

1575
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:42,400
It was whether or not believe people see
it.

1576
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:44,080
What do the fuck knows,
man?

1577
01:07:44,081 --> 01:07:46,870
There was wooly mammoths and Saber Tooth
Tigers here 10,000

1578
01:07:46,871 --> 01:07:48,580
years ago,
seven foot tall,

1579
01:07:48,581 --> 01:07:51,760
giant fucking birds like a few hundred 
thousand years ago.

1580
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:56,880
There was animals on this planet,
in this continent that don't exist 

1581
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:57,510
anymore,
that were pretty fucking crazy.

1582
01:07:57,650 --> 01:08:02,650
Craziest.
Saber tooth tigers are crazier than 

1583
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:02,650
bigfoot.
Bigfoot's.

1584
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:06,031
Just another big monkey.
If big foot was gigantic because it's 

1585
01:08:06,031 --> 01:08:06,970
just another large primate that went 
extinct,

1586
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,790
whereas big foot supposed to be living 
Pacific northwest,

1587
01:08:09,791 --> 01:08:12,970
which is if you follow the the traveling
down the bering strait,

1588
01:08:12,971 --> 01:08:16,220
which is where Indians came here.
American Indians

1589
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:21,110
originated in Siberia and Asia and they 
came down from there.

1590
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:23,540
America,
what people don't realize is 10,000

1591
01:08:23,541 --> 01:08:28,541
years ago,
half of America was under a mile high 

1592
01:08:28,541 --> 01:08:30,020
sheet of ice.
This was covered in ice.

1593
01:08:30,021 --> 01:08:35,021
It's like a barren land,
but something dramatic happened to the 

1594
01:08:35,021 --> 01:08:36,020
environment of the earth and the ice 
age.

1595
01:08:36,021 --> 01:08:41,021
When it ended,
the America opened up and that's when 

1596
01:08:41,021 --> 01:08:41,510
people started moving here.
When people,

1597
01:08:41,511 --> 01:08:42,740
some of the people had already moved 
here.

1598
01:08:42,741 --> 01:08:43,250
There was,
there was.

1599
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:45,770
They found Chinese bodies here from 
10,000

1600
01:08:45,771 --> 01:08:47,380
years ago,
but when,

1601
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:50,180
when people started moving here,
they came from there.

1602
01:08:50,181 --> 01:08:55,181
They came from the Bering Strait.
That's like the number one theory of a 

1603
01:08:55,181 --> 01:08:58,181
big percentage of the American Indians.
So they came down from Asia and this 

1604
01:08:58,181 --> 01:09:01,240
monkey lived in Asia and if this thing 
followed them with the fuck knows,

1605
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:03,650
is there any compelling evidence for 
Loch Ness Monster?

1606
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:06,590
There's pictures,
there's their scans from radar,

1607
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:11,620
they think it could be a big fish that 
could have got landlocked that was 

1608
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:11,620
extinct in other places,
but not there.

1609
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:14,540
The problem with Loch ness is it's 
really murky.

1610
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,090
They can't see and it could be a bunch 
of other things.

1611
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:22,100
Could be a bunch of other things that 
people are misconstruing and there's 

1612
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:22,160
been a bunch of hoaxes,
but when,

1613
01:09:22,161 --> 01:09:24,260
when enough people have seen things,
you've got to wonder,

1614
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:24,980
well,
what the fuck?

1615
01:09:24,981 --> 01:09:29,981
Is it an eel?
Is it when you got to think of all the 

1616
01:09:29,981 --> 01:09:29,981
animals that are real,
you know,

1617
01:09:29,981 --> 01:09:34,060
is it a adult in Moseley floating wood 
and just people knowing the story and 

1618
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:34,060
going,
oh,

1619
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:38,981
there it is.
There's more evidence for big foot or 

1620
01:09:38,981 --> 01:09:39,500
loch ness monster.
Probably bigfoot because bigfoot,

1621
01:09:39,501 --> 01:09:41,420
there's the American Indians.
That's a big,

1622
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:46,540
big part of the lure of big foot.
There's over 250 American Indian names 

1623
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:51,101
for big foot.
Big Foot was born in the imagination of 

1624
01:09:51,101 --> 01:09:51,860
an American Indian that just might've 
made that mention.

1625
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:57,250
It might've been 20 big foot was born in
the head of an American Indian.

1626
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:03,320
That was just winning at attention.
You imagine one dude came up with that 

1627
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:08,420
and spread it happened in every.
All the other ones that somebody hearing

1628
01:10:08,421 --> 01:10:11,180
that same story and just being paranoid 
walking through the woods later.

1629
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:16,470
It's like other tribes,
other tribes with like these fucking 

1630
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:20,080
costumes,
like bear costume was the most 

1631
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:20,240
compelling evidence about.
Big Foot is actually the audio tapes.

1632
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:25,480
There's these audio tapes of these crazy
primate howls that they've recorded in 

1633
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:28,070
the Pacific northwest and they're really
fucking loud.

1634
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:31,160
They're really loud and interesting and 
these have been done,

1635
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:36,370
you know,
and and supposedly by legit scientists 

1636
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:40,080
that have recorded these sounds.
So it could be somebody let a monkey 

1637
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:40,670
loose.
They had a crazy pet monkey and they let

1638
01:10:40,671 --> 01:10:42,620
that motherfucker lose and he's 
screaming in the woods.

1639
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:47,830
We put you in the woods.
You could make up some sounds that they 

1640
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:47,830
would think of as big foot in lochness 
announcements.

1641
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:48,900
Baby.
What's the worst?

1642
01:10:48,901 --> 01:10:51,580
The conspiracy to like the worst one?
Flat Earth.

1643
01:10:51,990 --> 01:10:54,500
There's people that flat to the young 
earth.

1644
01:10:54,501 --> 01:10:55,610
That's another bad one.
No,

1645
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:55,940
no,
no,

1646
01:10:55,941 --> 01:10:56,720
no.
Like today,

1647
01:10:56,721 --> 01:10:59,480
people don't believe that young earth.
They believe the young earth.

1648
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:01,370
Yeah,
that's a big percentage of the Christian

1649
01:11:01,371 --> 01:11:03,470
population.
There's a guy on twitter,

1650
01:11:03,471 --> 01:11:05,810
I follow them all the time.
He's just crazy retarded.

1651
01:11:05,811 --> 01:11:08,960
Uh,
a Christian young Earth Guy who's always

1652
01:11:08,961 --> 01:11:11,460
talking about the evidence against 
evolution.

1653
01:11:11,490 --> 01:11:13,330
Yes.
These youtube videos just,

1654
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:18,470
just,
you can't watch them for more than five 

1655
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:20,481
minutes because the insanity radiates 
off the screen and it starts to get you 

1656
01:11:20,481 --> 01:11:21,680
blond hair.
Cute Lips was really nice.

1657
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:27,410
They,
they believed that the earth is less 

1658
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:27,410
than 10,000
years old.

1659
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:30,860
A lot of people,
more than 50 percent during a recent 

1660
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:31,590
Gallup poll in the United States believe
that the earth,

1661
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,230
the earth is the age that is depicted in
the Bible,

1662
01:11:34,231 --> 01:11:35,610
which is less than 10,000
years old.

1663
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:36,800
They probably don't even know what that 
is.

1664
01:11:36,801 --> 01:11:38,450
I was going to the Bible say that.
Yeah,

1665
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,950
it's the Bible probably.
What does,

1666
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:42,770
what does Jesus thing?
Yeah.

1667
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:47,870
That's all they have to hear.
There's a lot of dumb ass conspiracy 

1668
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:47,870
theories.
Big Foot's not the dumbest one.

1669
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:48,930
Big Foot.
There's,

1670
01:11:48,931 --> 01:11:51,120
there's,
there's a real animal that they can lock

1671
01:11:51,121 --> 01:11:52,890
that too.
It's like if there's one,

1672
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:55,710
the Jersey Devil,
some fucking giant monster,

1673
01:11:55,711 --> 01:11:58,800
that's like half the one God,
but I to Texas one.

1674
01:11:58,801 --> 01:12:00,960
Well the two Chupacabra,
they've narrowed that down to.

1675
01:12:00,961 --> 01:12:05,961
They think it's mange mange on coyotes 
because they've had dead coyotes that 

1676
01:12:05,961 --> 01:12:07,710
they've shot and killed that were 
covered in mange.

1677
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:12,340
Do they don't even look real.
They look like Zombie Coyote looked like

1678
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:14,430
ghouls.
They lose all their hair.

1679
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:19,431
It's an.
It's a common disease and they have 

1680
01:12:19,431 --> 01:12:19,431
photos.
There's photos of him online.

1681
01:12:19,431 --> 01:12:23,361
If you look Chupa Cobra,
they have a headless when they chopped 

1682
01:12:23,361 --> 01:12:26,691
its head off and it's a coyote to coyote
that horrible mange and it has like 

1683
01:12:26,691 --> 01:12:30,380
almost blue dark bluish,
blackish skin and no hair and it looks 

1684
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:30,810
like a monster.

1685
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:35,990
So that's most likely the origin of the 
tube macabre because you're talking 

1686
01:12:35,990 --> 01:12:36,900
about something that killed goats and 
shit and killed chickens.

1687
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,290
That's what coyotes do.
You know.

1688
01:12:39,291 --> 01:12:40,740
So they,
they have that narrowed down.

1689
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:42,450
You know,
I was at the zoo this weekend,

1690
01:12:42,451 --> 01:12:45,750
man and I saw a leopard.
They had a leopard there and that it was

1691
01:12:45,751 --> 01:12:49,620
so sad that just pacing around just 
doesn't get to jack anything.

1692
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,450
Just pacing.
Look at all these people staring down.

1693
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:56,680
Well,
they've started to find leopards in 

1694
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:56,680
America.
Brown.

1695
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,940
Really?
That prints have made their way to 

1696
01:12:58,940 --> 01:12:58,940
Phoenix?
Yeah,

1697
01:12:58,940 --> 01:12:58,980
there's leopard sightings in Arizona.
Wow,

1698
01:12:58,981 --> 01:13:03,981
that's awesome.
And now they're coming up through South 

1699
01:13:03,981 --> 01:13:06,540
America and through Mexico and into 
America leopards pro.

1700
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:08,760
That's pretty good.
Leopards are no joke.

1701
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:12,240
Could you imagine if you were the first 
American to get jacked by a leopard?

1702
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:15,140
Love it.
What'd you check?

1703
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:18,600
There'll be leopard hunting season and 
those motherfuckers will be wiped out.

1704
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,010
Do you think so man,
tried to go into Texas in Texas.

1705
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:25,320
They don't even have to open up a 
hunting season in Texas.

1706
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,880
They'll just start shooting them.
The kids will shoot him.

1707
01:13:28,850 --> 01:13:33,210
Who were we talking about the other day?
That was jogging and they shot something

1708
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:38,300
and they had a newer,
more amazed that they had a gun while 

1709
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:40,601
they're jogging.
Somebody was telling us this story and 

1710
01:13:40,601 --> 01:13:40,601
what the fuck told us that.
What was that shit?

1711
01:13:40,601 --> 01:13:40,930
That sucks.
I thought,

1712
01:13:41,310 --> 01:13:46,310
nevermind.
Didn't they do that in Colorado when we 

1713
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:46,310
lived there to jog with?
You have to have a gun,

1714
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:46,310
right?
I carried a gun.

1715
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,130
Yeah,
I did.

1716
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:50,070
They have.
They have like jogging holsters.

1717
01:13:50,210 --> 01:13:52,710
You carried a gun.
Every time I went hiking.

1718
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:54,210
Right.
Fuck you.

1719
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:59,980
You fucking rifle behind you.
The last thing you want to do is be out 

1720
01:14:00,661 --> 01:14:04,740
there by yourself with your family in a 
fucking Predator attacks.

1721
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:08,310
You don't have a gun.
Especially when it's somebody that wants

1722
01:14:08,311 --> 01:14:10,380
your daughters.
It's so easy to shoot things.

1723
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,430
You know Kevin Gone.
You put it in your pocket.

1724
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:14,230
I mean that's pretty crazy.
Technology.

1725
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:16,510
You have this little thing in your 
pocket that can protect you.

1726
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:17,660
You know?
What are the.

1727
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:19,780
What are the odds of that?
You got to use that shit.

1728
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:22,090
I haven't been thinking really hard 
about getting a gun lately.

1729
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:27,100
Let me and like there's two of my 
friends that were both saying like they 

1730
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:27,100
just called me randomly,
like,

1731
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:27,100
Hey,
do you wanna get a gun?

1732
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:29,840
I think it was Duncan or somebody added 
a habit and not to need it.

1733
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:35,080
Needed not to have it.
You can't control all these people and 

1734
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,420
this world living out in the wilderness 
like you did.

1735
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,320
We talked about this before.
It's a lot like you know,

1736
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:44,230
no matter where you go,
you got to deal with some death.

1737
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:49,320
Either you live in the city and you've 
got to deal with muggers and rapists or 

1738
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:53,161
like gang bangers or something.
All you live way out away from that 

1739
01:14:53,161 --> 01:14:57,271
shit.
No Gang bangers are going out into the 

1740
01:14:57,271 --> 01:14:59,790
wilderness,
but then you've got to do with mountain 

1741
01:14:59,790 --> 01:15:01,531
lions and shit like that to deal with 
things and you gotta deal with weird 

1742
01:15:01,531 --> 01:15:04,891
people.
At least you can shoot them and you're 

1743
01:15:04,891 --> 01:15:06,721
cool.
Like you could just look at them and go 

1744
01:15:06,721 --> 01:15:08,340
Bam and just blast them.
You can't do that top bugger until he 

1745
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:08,340
jumps on.
You got to be careful with bears because

1746
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:09,100
bears are hard to kill.

1747
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:11,020
It's very hard to kill a bear with a 
pistol.

1748
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:13,120
If you've got a bear,
you're better off shooting.

1749
01:15:13,121 --> 01:15:15,490
And what about bear Mace works?
Yeah.

1750
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:20,730
You got to get them with it though.
They've got to be close enough for you 

1751
01:15:20,730 --> 01:15:22,771
to get on with it.
I didn't even know bear mace existed 

1752
01:15:22,771 --> 01:15:23,200
until South Park when I got to be 
careful.

1753
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:24,130
Oh,
was he?

1754
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:30,000
He thought it was the bounty hunter that
was in the South Park is based on 

1755
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:30,000
evergreen.
That's where those guys grew up.

1756
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,740
That's where I almost left.
I want to live in the mountains of 

1757
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:34,740
boulder,
but the mountains above Denver,

1758
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:38,731
there's one town called evergreen that I
really liked and that's where a south 

1759
01:15:38,731 --> 01:15:42,301
park is.
That's what it's based on actually from 

1760
01:15:42,301 --> 01:15:42,301
Denver.

1761
01:15:42,301 --> 01:15:42,301
Those dudes.
Yeah.

1762
01:15:42,301 --> 01:15:43,400
That's anybody want a drink?
Coconut water,

1763
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:46,400
coconut one.
Have you had these coconut waters?

1764
01:15:46,430 --> 01:15:46,970
I fuck,
yeah.

1765
01:15:47,030 --> 01:15:49,430
We need to be sponsored Brighton so they
can send us crates of them.

1766
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,010
So if you're listening.
Oh,

1767
01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:53,870
what is it?
C T S C two o.

1768
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,580
that's coconut water in the rural.
Better than that.

1769
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,490
It takes brain box one.
Oh,

1770
01:15:58,491 --> 01:15:59,570
totally.
What it tastes like.

1771
01:15:59,571 --> 01:16:04,571
It tastes like you just ate a bowl of 
fruit loops and it's the milk from the 

1772
01:16:04,571 --> 01:16:04,571
fruit loops.
Oh sure.

1773
01:16:04,571 --> 01:16:05,350
You know,
that's what it tastes like.

1774
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:08,480
Shit,
I'm a big fan on this stuff.

1775
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:14,570
Yeah.
I living in Colorado is just as tricky 

1776
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:14,570
as well.
Cheers.

1777
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:15,640
Salute.
Here's the.

1778
01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:20,060
Because there's gotta be a coconut water
alcoholic beverage,

1779
01:16:20,061 --> 01:16:22,040
right.
There has to be my go to a bar and say,

1780
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:27,390
get me in.
I bought Seagram's for my dad's 

1781
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:27,390
birthday.

1782
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:32,080
I bought him a crate of the shit that 
you always drink with the mushrooms and 

1783
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:32,420
stuff.
What's that called?

1784
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:37,550
Oh,
Kombucha created that in a creative 

1785
01:16:37,550 --> 01:16:37,550
coconut water.
He loves the Kabuki,

1786
01:16:37,550 --> 01:16:41,270
but the coconut water he doesn't like,
but he uses it for a Pina coladas.

1787
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:44,450
He doesn't like this stuff now.
He says it's weak.

1788
01:16:44,451 --> 01:16:49,451
He says he needs to add something to it.
I think when you get old you lose your 

1789
01:16:49,451 --> 01:16:49,451
taste,
but vodka,

1790
01:16:49,451 --> 01:16:51,530
coconut water will probably this shit.
When you get older,

1791
01:16:51,531 --> 01:16:52,480
you lose your taste buds.
Yeah.

1792
01:16:52,481 --> 01:16:57,481
He started losing taste.
One of older people are more likely to 

1793
01:16:57,481 --> 01:16:57,481
eat.
Ask them,

1794
01:16:57,481 --> 01:16:57,670
yes.
You would think that,

1795
01:16:57,710 --> 01:17:00,140
fuck no,
I would.

1796
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,780
After all the shits,
they had an

1797
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:07,040
the smelling and I remember that video 
we watched a long time ago about rods to

1798
01:17:07,831 --> 01:17:10,280
remember that shit so serious fucking

1799
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:14,270
video that this dude was in Mexico 
filming all these people.

1800
01:17:14,271 --> 01:17:19,271
Yeah,
filling these people will sky diving 

1801
01:17:19,271 --> 01:17:19,310
into this cliff.
There's a cliff that's like a mile down.

1802
01:17:19,311 --> 01:17:24,311
It's crazy.
It looks like someone took a an apple 

1803
01:17:24,311 --> 01:17:27,581
core to the earth and cut this gigantic 
hole out of the earth and these dudes 

1804
01:17:27,581 --> 01:17:31,550
would base jump off that bitch and 
skydive and fucking pull parachute will.

1805
01:17:31,551 --> 01:17:36,551
As they're filming a.
You see these things flying by the 

1806
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:37,400
camera like insane speed and they looked
like tubes.

1807
01:17:37,401 --> 01:17:41,660
They look like they're like wing tubes 
and this guy dedicated his whole life to

1808
01:17:41,661 --> 01:17:46,661
fucking tracking these things down and 
trying to find out what the fuck these 

1809
01:17:46,661 --> 01:17:49,931
things were.
The remodels turns out it was just an 

1810
01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:51,830
artifact.
It was a video camera artifact that when

1811
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:54,380
something moved too quickly,
too close to the screen,

1812
01:17:54,530 --> 01:17:59,530
it stretched the image out.
So it made the imagery was a flying 

1813
01:17:59,530 --> 01:17:59,530
snake.

1814
01:17:59,530 --> 01:18:01,250
Absolutely.
So this poor fuck literally made videos,

1815
01:18:01,251 --> 01:18:03,520
has websites.
Roswell Rod,

1816
01:18:03,550 --> 01:18:04,860
is he still on it?
He had a.

1817
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:07,220
He had given up.
Let's go to Roswell.

1818
01:18:07,221 --> 01:18:09,080
Rovs.com.
So you just fucking dummy.

1819
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:14,340
This is the problem man.
And this guy's making created guys 

1820
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:16,040
making money doesn't mean you have those
aren't real dude.

1821
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:18,730
Just because that guy fucked up.
No,

1822
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:21,140
it doesn't mean it's not real,
but it doesn't mean they're not real,

1823
01:18:21,141 --> 01:18:23,650
but it doesn't mean they are.
It's like you put,

1824
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:27,290
like you said,
it's most likely I will say that I'll,

1825
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:32,340
I'll take back.
I believe and I say it's most likely 

1826
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:32,340
real.
Gotten better.

1827
01:18:32,430 --> 01:18:34,400
Is that better?
Why?

1828
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:37,880
Why even have a fucking.
This is about opinions.

1829
01:18:37,881 --> 01:18:38,550
Like what are,
you know,

1830
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:40,940
you can't just pay,
just can't just speak to why.

1831
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:42,530
Why?
Why become attached.

1832
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:45,020
I'm just saying,
based on what I've seen,

1833
01:18:45,021 --> 01:18:46,100
it's most likely will take.

1834
01:18:46,110 --> 01:18:47,760
Decides down.
Fuck.

1835
01:18:47,770 --> 01:18:50,300
Kevin Kelly took.
He was videotaping mob.

1836
01:18:50,301 --> 01:18:55,301
It says this is the official website for
the mysterious frying entities called 

1837
01:18:55,301 --> 01:18:59,591
rods discovered by Jose escamia over at 
midway and jogger or something,

1838
01:19:00,891 --> 01:19:05,891
wasn't it?
It's just a light jog or he's just a 

1839
01:19:05,891 --> 01:19:05,891
dummy,
a dummy.

1840
01:19:05,891 --> 01:19:07,220
They got tricked by some shit,
you know,

1841
01:19:07,221 --> 01:19:12,221
I mean,
these guys on monster quest figured it 

1842
01:19:12,221 --> 01:19:12,221
out and fucking 10 minutes.
This guy has been trying to,

1843
01:19:12,221 --> 01:19:15,110
hey kid dot five,
roswell rods that come,

1844
01:19:15,111 --> 01:19:16,550
you're done son.
This,

1845
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,350
it doesn't exist.
It doesn't exist anymore.

1846
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:20,660
This guy fucking spent his whole life.
Do.

1847
01:19:20,661 --> 01:19:23,180
There needs to be a documentary on his 
shit because you know,

1848
01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:25,460
he tape everything,
right?

1849
01:19:25,690 --> 01:19:28,370
They need to get that footage and then 
get the footage of him.

1850
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:30,410
Now he's probably penniless and insane 
somewhere.

1851
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,510
I wonder how many emails he gets by 
mistake.

1852
01:19:32,511 --> 01:19:34,650
Like I heard you videotape a lot of 
rides.

1853
01:19:34,990 --> 01:19:37,510
He actually had another one that he was 
gay rights,

1854
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:41,060
Gay Roz warrant.
There was another one that he,

1855
01:19:41,061 --> 01:19:41,690
uh,
was,

1856
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:44,810
was chasing down another crazy thing 
that didn't seem to make any sense.

1857
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,650
Let me,
let me type his name because he had like

1858
01:19:48,651 --> 01:19:53,030
another thing that was like another 
theory about something else.

1859
01:19:53,031 --> 01:19:54,320
And then someone on the message board 
going,

1860
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:56,090
wait a minute.
Isn't that the rods guy?

1861
01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:58,760
And that's who he is from now on.

1862
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:02,780
I,
uh,

1863
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:05,700
oh,
lunar rising.

1864
01:20:05,730 --> 01:20:06,720
Oh,
here he goes.

1865
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:11,380
He's got some shit about the moon.
Yeah,

1866
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,980
he thinks there's fucking anomalies on 
the moon now.

1867
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:14,460
Oh,
okay.

1868
01:20:14,461 --> 01:20:16,650
Here we go.
It's the true color of the moon.

1869
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:19,470
For over 50 years,
we have been told and convinced the moon

1870
01:20:19,471 --> 01:20:23,610
is nothing more than a black and white 
desolate rock with moon dust and craters

1871
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,790
that thousands of photos released to the
public have always presented a black and

1872
01:20:26,791 --> 01:20:31,791
white moon.
Even with the most recent Hubble 

1873
01:20:31,791 --> 01:20:31,800
photographs of the moon are black and 
white.

1874
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:36,830
NASA continues to perpetuate the lie 
that in quotes that the moon is black 

1875
01:20:36,830 --> 01:20:37,710
and white with this mother fucker is 
crazy.

1876
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:41,370
He's like,
tammy switched over,

1877
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:42,520
switched over

1878
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:46,070
bunch of spots that he says,
oh my God,

1879
01:20:46,071 --> 01:20:51,071
this is hilarious.
Is they believe that the moon landing 

1880
01:20:51,071 --> 01:20:51,071
was a hoax.
Oh knows he's.

1881
01:20:51,071 --> 01:20:55,201
What he's showing is craters and he 
believes that these craters are 

1882
01:20:55,201 --> 01:20:58,460
different alien artifacts and these 
craters like,

1883
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,990
oh,
there's such a stretch.

1884
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:05,260
Like the photos are such a stretch is 
thinks that these structures are 

1885
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:05,840
artificial.
It's like fucking craters,

1886
01:21:05,841 --> 01:21:08,600
man.
Shit got smashed by rocks from space.

1887
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:13,830
You know,
sometimes a little shapes come out of 

1888
01:21:13,830 --> 01:21:13,830
that.
You fucking dummy.

1889
01:21:13,830 --> 01:21:16,090
Did you say the moon on Conan set last 
night on his first episode.

1890
01:21:16,091 --> 01:21:17,590
How was the first episode?
Did you watch it?

1891
01:21:17,591 --> 01:21:19,580
Yeah,
it felt really cheap,

1892
01:21:19,730 --> 01:21:22,010
like you know,
how you watch the NBC show.

1893
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:27,020
It felt like the furniture was high 
quality if felt like those were real 

1894
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:28,010
plants behind them.
It felt like a good backdrop.

1895
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:32,990
This felt like they got everything at 
fucking sears outlet,

1896
01:21:32,991 --> 01:21:33,610
you know,
and,

1897
01:21:34,310 --> 01:21:39,310
and,
and in the background was this horrible 

1898
01:21:39,310 --> 01:21:40,160
blue painting that just looked really 
cheap and generic.

1899
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:43,190
And then there was this moon in the 
middle of it that was kind of cool and I

1900
01:21:43,191 --> 01:21:44,870
guess it moves,
it moves,

1901
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:50,200
but it just looked like the whole thing 
look like low budget and it wasn't the 

1902
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:53,500
real moon or fake fake man or,
but it just look really low budget and I

1903
01:21:53,501 --> 01:21:54,560
don't know,
I was okay.

1904
01:21:54,561 --> 01:21:59,561
He had seth rogen on left side and 
listen how gay you are you looking at 

1905
01:21:59,561 --> 01:22:02,620
the set of control as a fan?

1906
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:04,900
I was a fan of the show.
I was a role.

1907
01:22:05,770 --> 01:22:10,770
Was it a real moon or fake news?
I couldn't comment on the furniture.

1908
01:22:11,070 --> 01:22:13,940
It was a real fan of the show in a lot 
of the reviewers of that,

1909
01:22:13,941 --> 01:22:16,250
you know,
like newspapers and stuff that reviewed,

1910
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:17,470
reviewed it,
you know,

1911
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,250
they made up an interesting point.
It's like,

1912
01:22:19,251 --> 01:22:24,251
why are you focusing on a 10th of a 
variation of the tonight show?

1913
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:26,150
You know,
that you're not being your own show.

1914
01:22:26,151 --> 01:22:28,760
You're being like the tonight show in a 
version of the tonight show.

1915
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:33,910
You have this new opportunity.
Why don't you fucking throw that desk 

1916
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:33,910
out a window and fucking do something.
You know,

1917
01:22:34,730 --> 01:22:39,730
people like that desk.
Isn't that funny that you liked having 

1918
01:22:39,730 --> 01:22:40,180
people on it?
Isn't it better to do it like this way?

1919
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,210
Just like this is like if we were here 
or.

1920
01:22:42,210 --> 01:22:44,600
I mean we have a table so we have our 
laptops and shit in front of us,

1921
01:22:44,601 --> 01:22:47,430
but I do have kind of a desto yeah.
But that's to put shit on that.

1922
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,990
They don't see.
They don't see the dose.

1923
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:51,640
There's always a pencil and a piece of 
paper now.

1924
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:55,430
Yeah.
But our viewers don't see the deaths.

1925
01:22:55,490 --> 01:22:56,090
Well,
I mean he.

1926
01:22:56,091 --> 01:22:57,860
I guess it's cool that he has notes and 
everything.

1927
01:22:57,870 --> 01:22:59,270
What they could put that on a 
teleprompter.

1928
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:02,330
I think there's some security to the 
desk because it's been there forever.

1929
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:05,810
Just because you get boners when Pamela 
Anderson from years ago was on.

1930
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:06,420
Yeah,
it doesn't.

1931
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:11,520
It doesn't look cool.
You get nervous when you're seeing 

1932
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,680
Pamela.
I'm gonna let you sit there on stage.

1933
01:23:16,581 --> 01:23:21,581
No desk and they're on a big lazy boy.
Just got a headset on and you don't want

1934
01:23:22,881 --> 01:23:27,881
to be too lazy though.
Just in the conversation will be 

1935
01:23:27,881 --> 01:23:27,881
interesting.

1936
01:23:27,881 --> 01:23:30,940
Conan.
Just have a cool house and invite some 

1937
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:30,940
cool people over,
you know,

1938
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:34,401
and just eating out.
That's actually now get some good 

1939
01:23:34,401 --> 01:23:34,401
cameras.
Had some good behind it,

1940
01:23:34,401 --> 01:23:36,180
but just have Conan with his little 
beard going,

1941
01:23:36,181 --> 01:23:36,840
hey,
check out.

1942
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:39,630
Check out my garage just hanging out in 
the garage and talk about your movie.

1943
01:23:40,130 --> 01:23:41,870
No,
the problem is that a lot of people like

1944
01:23:41,871 --> 01:23:44,210
to be in the audience and elect to have 
an audience there.

1945
01:23:44,211 --> 01:23:48,620
It plate makes the comedy place.
Two hundred people are sad and my people

1946
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:51,530
via skype.
That's cool.

1947
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:52,460
All right.
That'll work,

1948
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:57,490
man.
You know John Heffrons doin like comedy 

1949
01:23:57,490 --> 01:23:57,490
shows through skype,
something like skype.

1950
01:23:57,490 --> 01:23:59,150
It's a new form of video conferencing 
technology,

1951
01:23:59,151 --> 01:24:04,151
but he sits in a room and there's all 
these screens around him and he's like 

1952
01:24:04,151 --> 01:24:04,430
performing for all these other people 
that are in the room with them.

1953
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:05,450
It's pretty cool.
Shit.

1954
01:24:05,451 --> 01:24:09,290
It's actually two credible.
I hope that catches them not in front of

1955
01:24:09,291 --> 01:24:14,291
an audience.
Know he's doing some corporate gigs 

1956
01:24:14,291 --> 01:24:15,190
where he does them on a desk and the 
desk.

1957
01:24:15,230 --> 01:24:15,900
There's like,
there's.

1958
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:17,750
There's cameras at Com.
Adam,

1959
01:24:17,990 --> 01:24:20,210
can you hear laughter,
your everything.

1960
01:24:20,211 --> 01:24:23,120
They're all connected.
Everyone's conference called up and it's

1961
01:24:23,121 --> 01:24:23,470
like,
you know,

1962
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:24,110
5,100.

1963
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:25,250
Hold on.
They're crazy.

1964
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:29,570
I mean he's sitting there by himself in 
front of a laptop and then that could be

1965
01:24:29,870 --> 01:24:34,490
fucking the whole world listening and 
then you could hear all their laughter.

1966
01:24:34,491 --> 01:24:35,880
Can you imagine the shower?
Correct.

1967
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:39,560
You have a stereo system and as well he 
said it's really crazy because you could

1968
01:24:39,561 --> 01:24:42,950
see when you set it up you can see all 
these people in front of you,

1969
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:45,710
like you see them sitting like there's 
not just one screen.

1970
01:24:45,711 --> 01:24:50,711
It was like a dozen screens in front of 
him and he sees all these people in 

1971
01:24:50,711 --> 01:24:50,711
front of them.
So it's almost like an audience.

1972
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:54,890
Whoa.
At the shower ring convention.

1973
01:24:56,030 --> 01:24:58,400
Yeah man.
I'm not real interested in talk shows.

1974
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:00,410
You know,
like when I'd heard about it I was like,

1975
01:25:00,411 --> 01:25:05,411
you know,
I'm not going to really watch it like a 

1976
01:25:05,411 --> 01:25:07,091
podcast,
but it's not because it's seven minutes 

1977
01:25:07,091 --> 01:25:07,091
and all they're doing is talking about 
their moves.

1978
01:25:07,330 --> 01:25:08,510
They're talking about there.
I mean,

1979
01:25:08,511 --> 01:25:10,820
how often does someone have a really 
interesting story?

1980
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:13,640
It's not usually.
Most of the time they just pimping their

1981
01:25:13,641 --> 01:25:14,210
shit,
you know?

1982
01:25:14,211 --> 01:25:15,230
They'll have a little,
you know,

1983
01:25:15,231 --> 01:25:17,960
so what's been going on?
We recently had our second baby.

1984
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:23,180
To me it's good because you lay in bed 
and you're kind of like watching the 

1985
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:26,371
news kind of like,
it's like the news but mixed with humor 

1986
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:27,190
right now.
So it's kind of more just like,

1987
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:29,530
it's like I wouldn't watch it if it was 
like 8:00

1988
01:25:29,530 --> 01:25:29,530
PM.

1989
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:31,040
Right.
I mean,

1990
01:25:31,041 --> 01:25:32,600
I like them.
I mean they're okay,

1991
01:25:32,601 --> 01:25:34,430
but I don't go out of my way to see him.
I prefer,

1992
01:25:34,850 --> 01:25:36,590
I prefer the Jon Stewart show.
Honestly.

1993
01:25:36,591 --> 01:25:40,070
I think that the daily show,
the way he does it is the best way.

1994
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:42,830
He has a lot of shit that he fucks 
around with like his,

1995
01:25:43,070 --> 01:25:45,980
his monologues and his megan front of 
things in the news.

1996
01:25:45,981 --> 01:25:47,870
Even though it's all political for the 
most part.

1997
01:25:48,050 --> 01:25:53,050
He,
I think he hit the mark more than 

1998
01:25:53,050 --> 01:25:54,881
anybody.
He makes me laugh out loud more than 

1999
01:25:54,881 --> 01:25:57,650
anybody.
You guys already talk about the Golfer 

2000
01:25:57,650 --> 01:25:59,200
granicus weed smoking incident on the 
Jon Stewart show?

2001
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:00,880
No.
Didn't know what happened.

2002
01:26:00,881 --> 01:26:01,330
Yeah.
Yeah.

2003
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:03,110
He smoked pot.
He pulled out a giant.

2004
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:04,100
Was actually

2005
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:08,260
the bill Maher show was a dumpster?
No.

2006
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,670
Okay.
It was real time.

2007
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:15,910
But you know,
the executive said that it wasn't real 

2008
01:26:15,910 --> 01:26:16,720
pot.
That was a prop they had to say.

2009
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:18,380
Yeah.
But why do they have to say?

2010
01:26:19,010 --> 01:26:22,840
Why do they have to say it's not real?
Who the kids were,

2011
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:27,850
this is the first podcast we've done 
since proposition nine did not pass 19 

2012
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:28,310
rather did not pass,
you know,

2013
01:26:28,370 --> 01:26:33,370
and so there's a lot of fucking tears,
a lot of shit going on right now in this

2014
01:26:33,531 --> 01:26:38,531
country.
There's a lot of shit going on with pot 

2015
01:26:38,531 --> 01:26:38,660
and disinformation and people thinking 
that somehow or another,

2016
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,440
if you don't have pot and it's more 
accessible than it is now,

2017
01:26:42,441 --> 01:26:45,110
that the world's going to fall apart.
It's sad.

2018
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:50,140
I never thought when I was a little kid 
that we'd be here and now 2010 and this 

2019
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:51,080
would still be up for debate.

2020
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:56,520
Yeah.
But you also know that it's never going 

2021
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:59,051
to pay.
It's not going to pass that easily and 

2022
01:26:59,051 --> 01:26:59,051
the,
unless it's like an iphone app,

2023
01:26:59,051 --> 01:27:02,381
one single button,
all these people instead of having to 

2024
01:27:02,381 --> 01:27:04,610
register and then go get fucking take 
off work or go towards your lunch and we

2025
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,350
do that.
Otherwise would be too much fraud.

2026
01:27:06,370 --> 01:27:07,280
Yeah.
But you know,

2027
01:27:07,281 --> 01:27:08,960
in 10 years they're going to figure it 
out.

2028
01:27:08,961 --> 01:27:11,240
It's going to be on your fucking pagers 
maybe.

2029
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:15,400
But maybe there's probably some 
incentive to keep it complicated because

2030
01:27:15,410 --> 01:27:18,230
the more complicated,
absolutely less people vote and the more

2031
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:23,380
it's political aficionados that are in 
the mix instead of just the casual 

2032
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:25,100
person.
I knew that was going to happen now.

2033
01:27:25,150 --> 01:27:26,660
Did you?
I wasn't shocked at all.

2034
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:28,100
It was just like gay marriage,
you know,

2035
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:31,130
you thought that was gonna pass.
But then you know what's shocking to me,

2036
01:27:31,131 --> 01:27:32,570
man,
when the polls are right?

2037
01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:34,910
Because I'm like,
how are they,

2038
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:39,070
you know who fuck answers polls,
you know?

2039
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:42,020
Do you ever answered a poll?
Like online?

2040
01:27:42,110 --> 01:27:47,110
Yeah.
Or if somebody called you up and you 

2041
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:47,110
talk to them or.
Yeah.

2042
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:47,110
Yeah.
All the time.

2043
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:49,100
I do pose to you like if you're on TMZ 
and it's like,

2044
01:27:49,101 --> 01:27:51,740
that is Mel Gibson's butt look fat?
Yes or no?

2045
01:27:51,741 --> 01:27:55,010
I'm going to take the extra click the c 
note just to see what the answers are.

2046
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:56,510
No,
we don't.

2047
01:27:56,511 --> 01:27:57,890
You know,
first of all,

2048
01:27:57,891 --> 01:28:02,891
those aren't real polls,
but I made a poll is like you go 

2049
01:28:02,891 --> 01:28:02,960
somewhere and it's a multiple page 
thing.

2050
01:28:02,961 --> 01:28:04,830
We're asking a bunch of questions that 
much.

2051
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:08,470
Even a few questions.
10 questions sometimes like you know,

2052
01:28:08,471 --> 01:28:13,471
like once in a while,
like if a product that I really like 

2053
01:28:13,471 --> 01:28:15,230
that you get that spam email with,
like please answer 10 questions for us.

2054
01:28:15,250 --> 01:28:17,980
Do you agree?
If it's a company I like I'll give them.

2055
01:28:18,030 --> 01:28:20,910
I'll take the extra minute.
Brian,

2056
01:28:21,290 --> 01:28:22,730
why not?
I don't know.

2057
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:25,460
Anything that I could do to help the 
products that like,

2058
01:28:25,610 --> 01:28:28,040
you know,
like if it's like whatever apple,

2059
01:28:28,041 --> 01:28:29,240
you do do that.
Like you,

2060
01:28:29,530 --> 01:28:31,910
you like make little videos and shit 
when you like a product.

2061
01:28:31,911 --> 01:28:33,230
Yeah.
The only,

2062
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:36,710
the last poll I took was like who's the 
best submission artists in mma?

2063
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:39,980
Bj Penn.
Oh,

2064
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:44,981
and mma.
Marcel is nOt really an mma right 

2065
01:28:44,981 --> 01:28:46,430
anymore because he'd done though 
probably.

2066
01:28:47,410 --> 01:28:49,420
Yeah.
He's making so much money in jujitsu.

2067
01:28:49,470 --> 01:28:50,840
He doesn't need to go through all that 
shit.

2068
01:28:50,890 --> 01:28:53,120
He's making a teaching.
Yeah dude,

2069
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:56,200
his website man.
God daMn.

2070
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:59,990
He charges 30 bucks a Month to get his 
techniques.

2071
01:29:00,170 --> 01:29:01,440
Thirty.
YeAh.

2072
01:29:01,470 --> 01:29:02,040
That's a lot

2073
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:05,130
of fucking extra thousands a Month.
That dude who um,

2074
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:09,330
set it up that chessmaster joe,
josh,

2075
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:14,540
I think his last name is waitzkin.
I don't remember exactly how to 

2076
01:29:14,540 --> 01:29:14,790
pronounce his name.
Bobby fischer.

2077
01:29:15,210 --> 01:29:17,600
He's the one from that video searching 
for Bobby Fischer,

2078
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:22,620
the movie.
It was all based on him and he was a 

2079
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:25,170
child chess prodigy and now he's 
transferred that into becoming a jujitsu

2080
01:29:25,171 --> 01:29:30,171
guy.
He loves jujitsu and he treats treated 

2081
01:29:30,171 --> 01:29:30,171
just like chess or as a bunch of 
openings,

2082
01:29:30,171 --> 01:29:34,140
a bunch of different counters and have 
some broken down so he has the website 

2083
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:37,200
really like systematically organized the
way you would organize like chest 

2084
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:37,620
practice.
So it's pretty fucking interesting.

2085
01:29:37,621 --> 01:29:40,890
And someone who's a chess genius.
I mean that kind of a mind,

2086
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:43,750
that kind of a like,
you know,

2087
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:49,370
like retarded,
the word strategic that,

2088
01:29:49,580 --> 01:29:52,170
that kind of a strategic mindset apply 
to jujitsu.

2089
01:29:52,170 --> 01:29:53,190
It's kind of interesting.
I bet.

2090
01:29:53,630 --> 01:29:58,500
I mean if you were making free money 
just like 20 k a month,

2091
01:29:58,530 --> 01:30:01,740
which is probably in the area doing 
nothing,

2092
01:30:01,741 --> 01:30:06,741
why would you do?
I'm in my money does flow in the 

2093
01:30:06,741 --> 01:30:06,741
fucking.
He doesn't want to do it,

2094
01:30:06,741 --> 01:30:06,741
you know what I mean?
He doesn't need to.

2095
01:30:06,741 --> 01:30:10,080
You can just stick to being the greatest
jujitsu player of all time.

2096
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:15,100
Well,
I would love to see just professional 

2097
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:15,100
jujitsu because I've always said that,
you know,

2098
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:19,460
one of the best things about jujitsu,
Washington u two is you don't have any 

2099
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:20,970
guilt even though you're watching dudes 
get jacked and even if you jacker guy,

2100
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:26,210
there's no guilt.
It's because like when you knock 

2101
01:30:26,210 --> 01:30:26,210
somebody out or you hurt somebody or 
even watched someone get knocked out,

2102
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:29,280
at least part of my brain is like,
that guy just got fucked up.

2103
01:30:29,310 --> 01:30:34,310
You know,
there's a part of that god is not going 

2104
01:30:34,310 --> 01:30:35,991
to be the same again.
And like he got hit by a car when 

2105
01:30:35,991 --> 01:30:36,360
someone gets really fucking head kicked 
when,

2106
01:30:36,361 --> 01:30:39,030
when,
when gonzaga cro copped procop,

2107
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:40,950
when he had kicked broke up and knocked 
them out.

2108
01:30:41,070 --> 01:30:45,210
I remember I had an interview cop 
afterwards and he was just reallY,

2109
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:48,330
it was a dumb idea to interview him.
I sHould've probably protested,

2110
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:50,880
but we always interview the winner and 
the loser and he was up and they said,

2111
01:30:50,881 --> 01:30:51,840
okay,
interview the loser.

2112
01:30:51,990 --> 01:30:54,600
So I just automatically went to it.
But as I was talking to him,

2113
01:30:54,601 --> 01:30:59,601
I'm like,
this poor guy should not be getting 

2114
01:30:59,601 --> 01:30:59,601
interviewed right now.
This guy just.

2115
01:30:59,601 --> 01:31:00,880
He just got knocked unconscious.
He's not exactly sure what happened.

2116
01:31:00,881 --> 01:31:02,850
And I'm asking them questions.
You know,

2117
01:31:02,851 --> 01:31:04,170
when you see something like that,
man,

2118
01:31:04,171 --> 01:31:04,830
you go,
wow,

2119
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,720
there's a fucking price.

2120
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:08,970
Which jujitsu never feels like there's a
price,

2121
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:14,260
you know,
guys get jacked and even if they get 

2122
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:15,891
hurt,
like he's going to be okay and most of 

2123
01:31:15,891 --> 01:31:15,891
the time,
99 percent of the time.

2124
01:31:15,891 --> 01:31:20,090
But a marcella garcia man,
if he could Just do professional 

2125
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:20,220
jujitsu,
if they could have like a guy like that,

2126
01:31:20,490 --> 01:31:25,490
you could have professional jujitsu and 
even put it on tv and it would be 

2127
01:31:25,490 --> 01:31:26,640
exciting because he'd be just catching 
people all the time.

2128
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:29,610
THere's so many good guys now.
Marcello is still the king,

2129
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:32,580
but there's so many guys out there and 
still competing like,

2130
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:37,820
like Ryan Hall and Jeff Glover and all 
those new brazilians busted out.

2131
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:43,360
I'm rafael mendez cold brina,
a rafael lovato.

2132
01:31:43,921 --> 01:31:48,921
There's so many guys that are good at 
nogi that it should be in the olympics 

2133
01:31:48,921 --> 01:31:53,781
right away.
There's no reason why no good jujitsu 

2134
01:31:53,781 --> 01:31:57,540
shouldn't be in the olympics is a little
too slow for people that does that,

2135
01:31:57,950 --> 01:31:58,630
that board.
I mean,

2136
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:00,130
you have a funny story about going

2137
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:01,990
to watch what john jock.
Yeah.

2138
01:32:01,991 --> 01:32:06,991
That's one that I was always the guy in 
class that asked the questions about 

2139
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:12,300
yanking on colors and yanking on sleeves
and asking like how is that going to 

2140
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:12,810
translate in mma?
I mean,

2141
01:32:12,850 --> 01:32:13,930
because I was embarrassed.
I.

2142
01:32:14,050 --> 01:32:16,180
WHen I first started doing jujitsu,
I would tell guys,

2143
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:17,740
check,
check out this next slide.

2144
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:18,960
This guy's a jujitsu guy.
He's gonna.

2145
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:20,350
Fuck him up.
He's going to jack him.

2146
01:32:20,590 --> 01:32:25,590
And the first fight that I got really 
disappointed with was a bustamante 

2147
01:32:25,590 --> 01:32:27,130
against blender.
I love bustamante to death.

2148
01:32:27,131 --> 01:32:29,020
He's still one of my all time favorite 
fighters,

2149
01:32:29,021 --> 01:32:32,560
but I couldn't believe that he couldn't 
finish them off his back.

2150
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:34,900
It was just baffled me.
I kept saying,

2151
01:32:34,901 --> 01:32:39,901
okay,
he's going to get them right and he's 

2152
01:32:39,901 --> 01:32:39,901
going to get him on.
He's just setting him up.

2153
01:32:39,901 --> 01:32:39,901
He's going to get them and then it 
didn't happen and I asked sean,

2154
01:32:40,050 --> 01:32:45,050
I'm like,
what's going on with how come we never 

2155
01:32:45,050 --> 01:32:45,050
see sweeps and finishes off,
You know,

2156
01:32:45,050 --> 01:32:47,140
rarely off,
off from the bottom,

2157
01:32:47,141 --> 01:32:50,680
you'd never see sweeps and finishes at 
the same rate as you Do at the moon.

2158
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:52,990
Dealz at the moon.
Als are sweeping their,

2159
01:32:52,991 --> 01:32:54,810
finishing off their back.
Like,

2160
01:32:54,940 --> 01:32:58,390
I mean it's,
it's incredible how much action there is

2161
01:32:58,391 --> 01:33:00,040
like off your back,
but not an mma.

2162
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:05,340
It was different.
So it's because they don't have to hold 

2163
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:05,340
onto.
Yeah.

2164
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:06,730
Well if you practice setting up all your
submissions and sweeps,

2165
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:10,660
yanking and pulling on someone's outfit 
and that's actually part of the sweep.

2166
01:33:10,810 --> 01:33:14,350
You take that out and then you also add 
strikes.

2167
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:15,550
Man.
It just,

2168
01:33:15,551 --> 01:33:17,650
it's a whole different game.
So,

2169
01:33:17,651 --> 01:33:19,450
um,
you know,

2170
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:24,300
what was the question?
How did we get this talking about john?

2171
01:33:24,350 --> 01:33:27,930
Jack watching matches with you and you 
guys were both saying how boring.

2172
01:33:27,970 --> 01:33:28,840
Oh yes.
Yes.

2173
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:33,880
I always,
immediately I was questioning the 

2174
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:33,880
[inaudible] going,
man,

2175
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:34,030
this could be a problem.
This is makinG jujitsu look bad.

2176
01:33:34,031 --> 01:33:37,960
Like for me it was like,
how Does jujitsu and mma and then when I

2177
01:33:37,961 --> 01:33:42,961
went to the moon deals in 2000 as a 
purple belt with jacques and we're 

2178
01:33:42,961 --> 01:33:46,840
watching the black belts and like,
I can't even keep my eyes open there.

2179
01:33:46,890 --> 01:33:49,540
It's just so it just,
most of tHe matches,

2180
01:33:49,541 --> 01:33:52,940
one born there were some exciting magic 
and there still are some vr.

2181
01:33:53,050 --> 01:33:54,820
There's a lot of exciting matches with 
the gooey,

2182
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:57,030
but generally,
I mean we,

2183
01:33:57,220 --> 01:34:02,220
I was sitting there trying to keep my 
eyes open and john jack looked over and 

2184
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:02,220
he goes,
man,

2185
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:03,730
this is so boring.
He wanted to leave.

2186
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:09,120
And right there that struck them like,
damn one of the fucking baddest jujitsu 

2187
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:14,071
players of all time.
My master is bored with watching black 

2188
01:34:14,071 --> 01:34:14,130
belts.
Uh,

2189
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:17,230
played tug of war and the gi,
that's when I thought,

2190
01:34:17,231 --> 01:34:20,320
whoa man,
they're the key is a problem.

2191
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:25,321
And for me,
the reason why I started teaching 

2192
01:34:25,321 --> 01:34:25,810
without the g wasn't to separate myself 
from Brazil,

2193
01:34:26,010 --> 01:34:27,640
the brazilian jujitsu community.
It wasn't,

2194
01:34:27,860 --> 01:34:29,620
I wasn't me going,
fuck you,

2195
01:34:29,940 --> 01:34:31,200
you know,
you guys went the ge.

2196
01:34:31,450 --> 01:34:35,760
I took off the g for jujitsu.
I did this shit for jujitsu and I,

2197
01:34:36,030 --> 01:34:37,620
you know,
that's the one thing I want everybody.

2198
01:34:37,810 --> 01:34:42,810
I want everyone to understand,
especially the brazilians that hate me 

2199
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:45,870
is I did this for jujitsu.
The most important thing for me is how 

2200
01:34:45,870 --> 01:34:48,840
would you jitsu looks and nma and I feel
that the key is a problem for mma.

2201
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:51,670
So I decided when I opened up the 
school,

2202
01:34:51,790 --> 01:34:54,010
I want to try to bring jujitsu back of 
a,

2203
01:34:54,011 --> 01:34:59,011
do whatever I can personally,
whatever I can do to bring jujitsu back 

2204
01:34:59,011 --> 01:34:59,011
in

2205
01:34:59,011 --> 01:34:59,011
mma.
Well,

2206
01:34:59,011 --> 01:35:02,030
you did it also because you think that's
the most effective way to do it in mma?

2207
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:02,480
I mean,
yes,

2208
01:35:02,481 --> 01:35:03,140
no,
of course,

2209
01:35:03,141 --> 01:35:08,141
of course.
I thought it was the most effective way 

2210
01:35:08,141 --> 01:35:08,750
and I'm doing it for jujitsu.
I feel that if everyone lost the ge,

2211
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:14,120
uh,
10 years ago and just focused on no 

2212
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:14,870
geese submissions,
setting up everything in the clench,

2213
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:19,900
setting everything up with over hooks,
under hooks and had to control as 

2214
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:21,140
opposed to setting everything up with 
yanking and pooling collars and sleeves.

2215
01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:23,390
If we would've started everybody 10 
years ago,

2216
01:35:23,391 --> 01:35:25,100
we just killed the g of heleo would've 
said,

2217
01:35:25,250 --> 01:35:27,080
no more gate.
We we need to come back.

2218
01:35:27,081 --> 01:35:29,660
We need to dominate nma again,
man.

2219
01:35:29,661 --> 01:35:31,700
The world would be a different place.
We would see.

2220
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:37,460
We would see 100 shinya aoki,
a hundred havi vasquez.

2221
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:39,350
Did you see when Ryan Hall said 
recently,

2222
01:35:39,351 --> 01:35:41,690
you know a thing about how he doesn't 
play garden anymore.

2223
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:45,140
That always concerned with now is if he 
winds up on bottom,

2224
01:35:45,141 --> 01:35:46,940
is sweeping,
getting on top to finish.

2225
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:48,950
That's beautiful.
If you could do it,

2226
01:35:48,951 --> 01:35:50,360
but what about the guys?
You can't sweep.

2227
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:51,550
Yeah.
He's saying that you can't.

2228
01:35:52,090 --> 01:35:57,090
He's saying that you can't rely on your 
garden anymore when you can't rely on 

2229
01:35:57,090 --> 01:36:00,221
sweeps all the time either,
but you're going to be on your back 

2230
01:36:00,221 --> 01:36:00,221
regardless and if you could sweep them.
I'm.

2231
01:36:00,221 --> 01:36:05,080
Most of mY game is all about sweets.
I'm all about sweeping and getting on 

2232
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:08,201
top,
but you have to prepare for the worst 

2233
01:36:08,201 --> 01:36:10,331
case scenario.
A guy That puts on your back and you 

2234
01:36:10,331 --> 01:36:12,371
can't sweep them.
You better have a wicked finishing game 

2235
01:36:12,371 --> 01:36:12,470
off your back as well.
You got to have both.

2236
01:36:12,590 --> 01:36:16,220
You can't finish everybody from your 
back and you can't sweep everybody,

2237
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:20,000
but if a dude stuff's just all your 
sweeps and he stuffs all your finishes,

2238
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:21,200
he's just better than you.

2239
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:22,270
That's it,
you know,

2240
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:24,260
but you got to have as much game as 
possible.

2241
01:36:24,261 --> 01:36:29,261
It's amazing.
Somebody hasn't stepped up and tried to 

2242
01:36:29,261 --> 01:36:29,261
make a professional jujitsu league,
you know,

2243
01:36:29,261 --> 01:36:30,800
I know reconciler really did that thing 
for a little bit,

2244
01:36:30,801 --> 01:36:31,670
but you know,
he was,

2245
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:33,730
he was having a hard time with it,
but I think.

2246
01:36:33,940 --> 01:36:35,810
I think it's more popular now than it 
was then.

2247
01:36:36,050 --> 01:36:38,120
The problem with the ricoh temporarily 
promotion,

2248
01:36:38,121 --> 01:36:40,460
which was professional submission league
psl,

2249
01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:45,850
great concept.
He just had like eight superfight 

2250
01:36:45,850 --> 01:36:45,850
matches.
Man.

2251
01:36:45,850 --> 01:36:45,850
He had,
he had marcello and they're against.

2252
01:36:45,850 --> 01:36:47,420
Jake shields had marcello and they're 
against cameron earl.

2253
01:36:47,780 --> 01:36:52,780
He was,
but he was the only way he thought he 

2254
01:36:52,780 --> 01:36:52,780
could make it work and sell it to a 
network or something.

2255
01:36:52,780 --> 01:36:57,761
Even like espn or something was to have 
randy couture as the main event and 

2256
01:36:58,041 --> 01:37:01,850
randy couture originally,
he retired a few years ago and he wasn't

2257
01:37:01,851 --> 01:37:03,260
planning on doing mma anymore,
but he,

2258
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:08,320
he,
his plan was just to stay in the mix 

2259
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:08,630
competitively and do submission 
grappling.

2260
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:10,490
So rico jumped on and said,
hey dude,

2261
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:12,080
you're going to be the poster boy to 
this,

2262
01:37:12,110 --> 01:37:17,110
you're going to blow this up.
But then when you decided to go back to 

2263
01:37:17,110 --> 01:37:18,290
mma,
he was left without a poster child.

2264
01:37:18,291 --> 01:37:19,220
And I mean,
I think,

2265
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:22,400
I think he could make it successful with
the guys we have nowadays,

2266
01:37:22,401 --> 01:37:25,880
like make marcello garcia the poster 
child and then bring in,

2267
01:37:26,110 --> 01:37:28,910
you know,
cabrina bringing rafael mendez,

2268
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:30,730
bringing braulio esteem.
Uh,

2269
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:32,900
bring in again,
Jeff Glover,

2270
01:37:32,901 --> 01:37:34,250
Ryan Hall,
hobby vasquez,

2271
01:37:34,251 --> 01:37:37,910
all These guys that I'm no hobbies back 
in the mix in mma now.

2272
01:37:37,911 --> 01:37:40,760
But I think you could do it now.
I don't think you need randy couture.

2273
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:46,060
I don't think what they really need is 
they need to get some sort of a network 

2274
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:49,151
behind it.
Someone who's willing to step up and 

2275
01:37:49,151 --> 01:37:49,151
take a chance with it.
But it's hard,

2276
01:37:49,151 --> 01:37:49,151
man.

2277
01:37:49,151 --> 01:37:51,170
Look at bella [inaudible] bell tours on 
like fox sports net.

2278
01:37:51,171 --> 01:37:56,171
You know what I'm saying?
It's like they have a hard time getting 

2279
01:37:56,171 --> 01:37:56,171
a network where people are gonna pay 
attention to it.

2280
01:37:56,171 --> 01:37:58,380
If you have jujitsu on fox sports net,
it's going to be really tough.

2281
01:37:58,381 --> 01:38:03,381
You know,
there's not a lot of people that are 

2282
01:38:03,381 --> 01:38:04,551
like focused on that.
If you get it on espn on the other hand 

2283
01:38:04,551 --> 01:38:07,761
and made a big deal and the difference,
the difference between submission 

2284
01:38:07,761 --> 01:38:10,710
grappling and mma,
the the advantage.

2285
01:38:10,711 --> 01:38:13,080
It can be a small advantage in some 
people's eyes,

2286
01:38:13,081 --> 01:38:18,081
but people will get into it because 
anybody can actually practice it and you

2287
01:38:19,021 --> 01:38:22,380
can go to your local Jujitsu school and 
you actually can get involved.

2288
01:38:22,381 --> 01:38:26,740
So and as the potential is there,
of course it's not.

2289
01:38:26,910 --> 01:38:31,200
It'll never be as exciting as dudes 
smashing skulls and and all that kind of

2290
01:38:31,201 --> 01:38:31,530
stuff.

2291
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:36,530
But a submission,
grappling with the right guys can be 

2292
01:38:36,530 --> 01:38:37,620
very,
very exciting.

2293
01:38:37,621 --> 01:38:42,621
And I hear,
I think it could be successful if they 

2294
01:38:42,621 --> 01:38:42,621
got dogs and frisbees at 1:30
in the morning.

2295
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:45,420
You can throw up some nogi Jujitsu up 
there for sure.

2296
01:38:45,421 --> 01:38:49,950
They got the pool is huge.
I mean paul is on tv all the time,

2297
01:38:49,970 --> 01:38:54,870
so to starvIng to death,
but it's on tv barely.

2298
01:38:54,930 --> 01:38:59,930
It's barely on tv.
A lot of those matches that you watch 

2299
01:38:59,930 --> 01:39:02,040
old matches.
The women have some on espn or there's 

2300
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:05,121
no money in it.
No one's making any money overseas to 

2301
01:39:05,121 --> 01:39:09,111
make the real money.
Ms dot couple tournament's like the us 

2302
01:39:09,111 --> 01:39:09,111
open.
You went out,

2303
01:39:09,111 --> 01:39:12,170
you went $40,000,
get to play for a week and that's only 

2304
01:39:12,170 --> 01:39:12,170
the winner.
You know,

2305
01:39:12,170 --> 01:39:12,930
you get down to like the other people.
There's not much.

2306
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:19,790
There's not much money in it,
but it's still on the air and I could 

2307
01:39:19,790 --> 01:39:23,251
see submission grappling like that on 
the air and no one's really making that 

2308
01:39:23,251 --> 01:39:23,251
much money except for the top guys.

2309
01:39:23,251 --> 01:39:24,030
But then you got like poker that's 
making money,

2310
01:39:24,031 --> 01:39:26,340
right?
who wants his fucking poker?

2311
01:39:26,510 --> 01:39:28,020
the thing about poker is,
man,

2312
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:33,200
the thing about you watch poker,
I love about her is that you could watch

2313
01:39:34,231 --> 01:39:37,470
and you could know what we all have.
Like when you're watching at home,

2314
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:39,210
you can't affect the outcome of the 
game.

2315
01:39:39,211 --> 01:39:40,950
So you could see like if you had to 
aces,

2316
01:39:40,951 --> 01:39:44,580
you had an ace and a king.
You could see without you seeing when he

2317
01:39:44,581 --> 01:39:46,680
had the people watching,
could see what he had.

2318
01:39:46,830 --> 01:39:50,220
So they know everyone is in on it.
So how's this gonna play out?

2319
01:39:50,221 --> 01:39:52,470
And it loaded.
What if facebook is like that?

2320
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:57,500
Where you knew what the pitcher was 
gonna throw like right before they let 

2321
01:39:57,500 --> 01:40:01,750
you know.
That's interesting because if they let 

2322
01:40:01,750 --> 01:40:03,180
you know a second before you throw,
how could he ever get to him?

2323
01:40:03,210 --> 01:40:05,790
How could it get to him that quick and 
if he's looking somewhere else,

2324
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:07,470
he's keeping his eye.
He would fuck them up.

2325
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,390
That's a good idea right away.
Boom.

2326
01:40:09,970 --> 01:40:12,600
Yeah.
If you had the picture had like a little

2327
01:40:12,601 --> 01:40:14,760
thing on his mouth,
you know what?

2328
01:40:14,761 --> 01:40:19,761
It would have to be someone who could 
read the signs because the catcher is 

2329
01:40:19,761 --> 01:40:22,701
giving those signs or just do it like a 
22nd delay because the catcher gives 

2330
01:40:22,701 --> 01:40:23,640
those signs with the pitcher.
Give those signs.

2331
01:40:23,910 --> 01:40:26,760
Who decides what gets thrown?
Think a catcher,

2332
01:40:26,790 --> 01:40:30,330
the picture can say,
no fucking the pitcher has.

2333
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:33,390
He's like the executive producer and the
producer,

2334
01:40:33,391 --> 01:40:36,000
but you can have like bitchy arguments.
You can totally.

2335
01:40:36,090 --> 01:40:38,120
You can see that you see him going,
oh dude,

2336
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:38,590
no,
no,

2337
01:40:38,591 --> 01:40:39,060
no,
no.

2338
01:40:40,410 --> 01:40:42,780
Basically the catcher trying to get them
to agree like,

2339
01:40:42,781 --> 01:40:43,470
okay,
what are we going to do?

2340
01:40:43,471 --> 01:40:45,450
It's up to you,
but you want to throw this.

2341
01:40:45,451 --> 01:40:48,170
I'm just suggesting this,
but you could do that with football too,

2342
01:40:48,171 --> 01:40:50,310
like uh,
right before the snap boom.

2343
01:40:50,311 --> 01:40:55,311
It's going to be a run or something.
Dallas is one of the hardest things 

2344
01:40:55,311 --> 01:40:55,311
about putting anything together

2345
01:40:55,311 --> 01:40:56,800
is getting two people to agree on what 
should be done.

2346
01:40:57,190 --> 01:41:02,190
You know,
like if you have an executive producer 

2347
01:41:02,190 --> 01:41:04,441
and you have the talent and they're 
together and they're trying to figure 

2348
01:41:04,441 --> 01:41:04,441
out how to work things out,
man,

2349
01:41:04,441 --> 01:41:05,740
that's a hard fucking thing to come 
together on.

2350
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:09,110
You'd have to put it on a ten second 
delay then that would ensure that no,

2351
01:41:09,140 --> 01:41:10,070
for the baseball thing,
I mean,

2352
01:41:10,270 --> 01:41:11,020
if there's no,
uh,

2353
01:41:11,290 --> 01:41:12,880
you,
you've had that with music though,

2354
01:41:12,881 --> 01:41:14,080
right?
You've had that with music.

2355
01:41:14,081 --> 01:41:16,340
We're dudes are trying to fuck with your
shit and you didn't like it.

2356
01:41:16,350 --> 01:41:18,460
Remember that executive producer you 
were working with for awhile?

2357
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:20,680
Which one?
The guy down in san diego.

2358
01:41:20,890 --> 01:41:25,890
Oh yeah.
Where you wanted to do all this and do 

2359
01:41:25,890 --> 01:41:25,890
all that.
Now.

2360
01:41:25,890 --> 01:41:26,770
That wasn't a sudden you'll fuck.
Exactly.

2361
01:41:26,771 --> 01:41:27,730
I was all time.
Yeah,

2362
01:41:27,940 --> 01:41:30,100
I've had it happen with everything I've 
ever done.

2363
01:41:30,130 --> 01:41:32,110
Everything I've ever done that has to do
with creativity.

2364
01:41:32,111 --> 01:41:34,210
That involves other people.
They all want to do.

2365
01:41:34,930 --> 01:41:36,280
I am open to hear shit.
I'm.

2366
01:41:36,330 --> 01:41:38,590
I've always been that way in every band 
that I've been in,

2367
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:41,770
the rule has always been the same.
We are five of us.

2368
01:41:42,010 --> 01:41:47,010
I'm 22 years old.
Everyone's like in their early twenties 

2369
01:41:47,010 --> 01:41:48,790
like anybody can write,
but we all have to like it.

2370
01:41:49,150 --> 01:41:50,470
Like if you want to come up with 
something,

2371
01:41:50,590 --> 01:41:55,590
okay.
We all have to like it because when 

2372
01:41:55,590 --> 01:41:55,590
you're on stage man,
what's most important?

2373
01:41:55,660 --> 01:41:57,850
You would rather play someone else's 
good shit.

2374
01:41:58,030 --> 01:42:00,330
Then you're bad shit.
Ooh,

2375
01:42:00,610 --> 01:42:05,610
you don't want.
No one wants to go on stage and the 

2376
01:42:05,610 --> 01:42:05,610
crowd's going,
what the fuck is this?

2377
01:42:05,610 --> 01:42:07,240
And no one's liking and the other guys 
are going to talk behind their back.

2378
01:42:07,241 --> 01:42:07,540
Like,
dude,

2379
01:42:07,541 --> 01:42:08,230
I don't want to do this song.

2380
01:42:08,230 --> 01:42:10,720
And that's the last thing you want.
You want to avoid that.

2381
01:42:11,050 --> 01:42:11,830
It's,
you know what I mean?

2382
01:42:11,831 --> 01:42:16,831
So what ends up happening is real quick,
you end up gravitating to the guy who's 

2383
01:42:16,871 --> 01:42:21,871
putting together the best shit.
There's always a band where you know 

2384
01:42:21,871 --> 01:42:22,510
that they're just given this fucking 
drummer a bone,

2385
01:42:22,511 --> 01:42:25,810
letting them sing right now.
There's always a few songs like that,

2386
01:42:25,820 --> 01:42:26,430
right?
Dude,

2387
01:42:26,790 --> 01:42:29,920
the perfect example is peter criss from 
kiss.

2388
01:42:30,130 --> 01:42:33,220
He co wrote a song.
Keep thinks he wrote beth,

2389
01:42:33,250 --> 01:42:36,790
but really bob ezrin wrote it and he'll 
famous producer.

2390
01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:38,440
And so it says peter,
chris,

2391
01:42:38,441 --> 01:42:40,360
and bob ezrin.
That was the biggest kiss.

2392
01:42:40,361 --> 01:42:41,650
Tsonga date.
Beth was huge.

2393
01:42:41,651 --> 01:42:43,840
It was a.
There was the first one that ever.

2394
01:42:43,841 --> 01:42:48,841
I was a huge kiss fan,
but it was the first one I made it on 

2395
01:42:48,841 --> 01:42:48,841
the radio.
Yeah,

2396
01:42:48,841 --> 01:42:49,420
that was massive.
Beth is fucking huge.

2397
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:54,420
So peter,
chris got a big head because I want to 

2398
01:42:54,420 --> 01:42:56,161
leave kiss.
You guys are letting me only write one 

2399
01:42:56,161 --> 01:42:56,161
song.
I want to write more songs.

2400
01:42:56,161 --> 01:42:56,440
He goes,
I'm going to make a solo album,

2401
01:42:56,441 --> 01:42:57,360
and Paul Simon goes,
doo doo,

2402
01:42:57,361 --> 01:43:00,100
doo doo doo doo doo.
We'll all make solo albums and we'll put

2403
01:43:00,101 --> 01:43:01,300
them together,
but let's not break up.

2404
01:43:01,330 --> 01:43:02,380
make a solo album.
That's cool.

2405
01:43:02,381 --> 01:43:03,100
Well,
I'll make so long.

2406
01:43:03,101 --> 01:43:05,050
So they all put out those salons at the 
same time.

2407
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:08,060
Peter christmas album,
the guy who wanted to leave to make this

2408
01:43:08,061 --> 01:43:10,470
all was not only the worst of the solo 
albums,

2409
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:13,380
but it's the worst kiss album ever.
He made.

2410
01:43:13,390 --> 01:43:17,890
He's known for the worst kiss.
No kiss fan has ever said they like that

2411
01:43:17,891 --> 01:43:18,820
album.
Really?

2412
01:43:18,821 --> 01:43:20,420
It's that,
that it's that bad.

2413
01:43:20,470 --> 01:43:22,000
It's bad.
Dude.

2414
01:43:22,001 --> 01:43:23,170
It's really,
really,

2415
01:43:23,171 --> 01:43:25,930
really bad.
So he's not in the in the band anymore,

2416
01:43:25,931 --> 01:43:30,931
but there's a fake peter criss now the 
way they did it originally when the 

2417
01:43:30,931 --> 01:43:34,860
peter and ace left,
they replaced them with new characters 

2418
01:43:34,860 --> 01:43:35,860
like Eric Fox came on to replace of as 
the fox.

2419
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:40,180
Vinny vincent came on to replace ace for
the as the egyptian god or something,

2420
01:43:40,510 --> 01:43:42,790
but then then they finally took the 
makeup off.

2421
01:43:42,791 --> 01:43:47,791
They went like 10,
15 years without makeup and then when 

2422
01:43:47,791 --> 01:43:47,791
they put the makeup back,
they got peter and ace,

2423
01:43:47,791 --> 01:43:52,650
the original guys back.
They did a couple of reunion tours in 

2424
01:43:52,650 --> 01:43:53,030
the exact same thing happened.
Peter fucked up,

2425
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:54,530
fucked up.
so they kicked him out.

2426
01:43:54,740 --> 01:43:56,420
But this time,
what happened to the fox?

2427
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:58,020
Where'd that guy go?
He died actually,

2428
01:43:58,040 --> 01:43:58,890
no.
Um,

2429
01:43:59,210 --> 01:44:00,250
but uh,
when they,

2430
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:05,680
when they did the reunion tour,
you got to bring back the original guys 

2431
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:06,470
because there was two other guys that 
were a trigger of this picture.

2432
01:44:07,310 --> 01:44:09,410
It's a really tattooed on this guy's 
side.

2433
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:14,440
He was a,
he was a Bartender or a server at the 

2434
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:17,570
cap city kid kidney bobby.
And he rented a ace and he was drunk and

2435
01:44:17,571 --> 01:44:19,720
he was talking all this shit to ace 
Freely and he's feeling.

2436
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:20,900
He goes,
fuck you kid.

2437
01:44:21,170 --> 01:44:25,310
So he gets a picture tattooed on him 
with,

2438
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:28,550
fuck you kid,
let's put it up here.

2439
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:29,720
THat's amazing.
So yeah,

2440
01:44:29,870 --> 01:44:31,730
but I'll put it on my twitter later 
today.

2441
01:44:32,030 --> 01:44:37,030
But he got this fucking tattoo of ace 
freely tattooed on his whole side of his

2442
01:44:37,371 --> 01:44:42,371
body is permanently a big picture of a 
shitty one to have ace freely where it 

2443
01:44:42,371 --> 01:44:43,330
says,
fuck you kid underneath it.

2444
01:44:43,340 --> 01:44:46,160
That's incredible.
So when they decided to do the reunion,

2445
01:44:46,220 --> 01:44:48,110
they got the original guys,
ace and peter.

2446
01:44:48,111 --> 01:44:49,940
It's been like 15 years.
Of course they wanted to do.

2447
01:44:49,941 --> 01:44:51,350
They realized,
fuck we fucked up.

2448
01:44:51,351 --> 01:44:52,460
God dammit.
Why don't we leave,

2449
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,580
kiss and get kicked out at the same 
time?

2450
01:44:54,581 --> 01:44:59,581
It's like both.
They both got back in the reunion tours 

2451
01:44:59,581 --> 01:45:00,380
were massive.
They did a couple and then peter started

2452
01:45:00,381 --> 01:45:01,790
fucking up at a.
Started fucking up.

2453
01:45:01,790 --> 01:45:06,790
Somehow they left.
so instead of getting new guys with new 

2454
01:45:06,790 --> 01:45:08,480
characters,
they got new guys to play.

2455
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:10,870
Ace and peter did.
And they,

2456
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:14,920
they,
they kept to the guys and say as no,

2457
01:45:14,990 --> 01:45:16,670
they never did that.
They never did.

2458
01:45:17,220 --> 01:45:22,220
No,
they never pretended like that was the 

2459
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:22,220
real ace.
And that was the real peter.

2460
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:24,730
Maybe they did the first few shows.
Maybe they try to do some shenanigans.

2461
01:45:24,770 --> 01:45:26,210
Not saying that did shenanigans.
I said,

2462
01:45:26,211 --> 01:45:26,780
they said,
you know,

2463
01:45:26,781 --> 01:45:30,140
and now starring as Bang,
and they say the guy's name.

2464
01:45:30,410 --> 01:45:31,720
I don't know.
They've never felt safe.

2465
01:45:31,730 --> 01:45:34,130
Never said no.
They said the real guys name the because

2466
01:45:34,340 --> 01:45:36,590
because what happened is when they did 
the reunion tour,

2467
01:45:36,591 --> 01:45:41,591
eric singer,
the non makeup kiss drummer and bruce 

2468
01:45:41,591 --> 01:45:41,990
kulik,
the non makeup kiss guitar player,

2469
01:45:42,140 --> 01:45:47,140
they got leFt in the behind because 
we're going to do a reunion tour and 

2470
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:47,140
blow this shit up.

2471
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:47,800
This non makeup banning happened to.
But.

2472
01:45:48,210 --> 01:45:52,490
But when peter left,
they got the non makeup dude,

2473
01:45:52,491 --> 01:45:56,840
eric singer to play peter.
So he came in and he didn't.

2474
01:45:56,841 --> 01:46:00,320
He always said he was eric singer,
but they know that most of the fans that

2475
01:46:00,321 --> 01:46:01,850
are coming don't even know the 
difference.

2476
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,650
Oh man.
I liked kiss me when I was a kid.

2477
01:46:03,651 --> 01:46:04,650
I'm gonna.
Go check out kids.

2478
01:46:04,651 --> 01:46:06,410
They're fucking cool man.
Rock and roll all night.

2479
01:46:06,650 --> 01:46:09,740
They have no idea.
They realized they never hide it.

2480
01:46:09,741 --> 01:46:14,741
They never deny it,
but they know that it doesn't really 

2481
01:46:14,741 --> 01:46:14,741
matter.
They're just going to come up.

2482
01:46:14,741 --> 01:46:15,020
We're going to say,
that's eric singer.

2483
01:46:15,021 --> 01:46:17,240
We're going to say that's tommy thayer 
plan a's,

2484
01:46:17,510 --> 01:46:22,510
but most of the people aren't even going
to notice what was the deal with age 

2485
01:46:22,510 --> 01:46:24,230
freely and peter criss or why couldn't 
they get it together?

2486
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:25,520
The exact same thing.

2487
01:46:25,730 --> 01:46:30,290
Drugs and alcohol and peter and then 
again all to peter.

2488
01:46:30,470 --> 01:46:35,470
Peter was not a very good drummer back 
when he practiced a lot and when you.

2489
01:46:35,740 --> 01:46:37,040
I mean it sucked.
Jujitsu,

2490
01:46:37,041 --> 01:46:38,870
man.
You don't fucking keep practicing.

2491
01:46:38,871 --> 01:46:41,270
You lose your chops.
You have a drummer,

2492
01:46:41,271 --> 01:46:44,900
has to be like a fucking machine 
literally on time.

2493
01:46:45,410 --> 01:46:49,160
And peter and paul and gene have never,
never stopped touring,

2494
01:46:49,270 --> 01:46:51,960
never stopped putting out albums.
Those guys that are machines,

2495
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:54,510
they could sing their ass off and they 
could play.

2496
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:58,170
I mean paul is unconscious playing and 
singing and gene.

2497
01:46:58,450 --> 01:47:03,450
He's a mo.
One of the most underrated bass players 

2498
01:47:03,450 --> 01:47:05,721
ever.
He can sing fucking harmonies like the 

2499
01:47:05,721 --> 01:47:05,721
beatles,
paul and gina machines,

2500
01:47:05,721 --> 01:47:06,810
bro.
So what they got,

2501
01:47:06,811 --> 01:47:09,090
they were decided to replace eric 
singer,

2502
01:47:09,091 --> 01:47:11,190
the old non makeup kiss guy.
They brought them in.

2503
01:47:11,191 --> 01:47:14,670
They put peter criss makeup on him when 
he can and he can sing.

2504
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,040
Eric singer can sing it and he can play 
his ass off.

2505
01:47:17,041 --> 01:47:18,900
He's an amazing drummer and he could 
sing.

2506
01:47:18,901 --> 01:47:20,330
So they go,
we're going to bring this guy back.

2507
01:47:20,350 --> 01:47:22,480
Does he sing beth now this?
Yes,

2508
01:47:22,670 --> 01:47:23,400
this is.
This is.

2509
01:47:23,580 --> 01:47:25,290
They did a reality show,
you know,

2510
01:47:25,350 --> 01:47:26,520
they did a.
The success,

2511
01:47:26,570 --> 01:47:31,570
the gene simmons show was so successful 
that they ended up doing it and they 

2512
01:47:31,570 --> 01:47:33,090
would show spots of kiss during the gene
simmons reality show,

2513
01:47:33,210 --> 01:47:35,760
but then they kind of did a spinoff.
Why don't we just follow kiss?

2514
01:47:36,090 --> 01:47:38,550
So reality shows all fucking fake.
You know what I mean?

2515
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:42,090
So most they had to make even the ones 
that are real,

2516
01:47:42,150 --> 01:47:45,750
the camera that the facial reactions 
like they have like one camera there and

2517
01:47:45,751 --> 01:47:47,970
how they're getting honey panning to all
these facial reactions.

2518
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:51,800
They like storing these facial reactions
from what you know from two weeks ago.

2519
01:47:51,810 --> 01:47:54,660
There's a good one to look.
That's how they do it different.

2520
01:47:55,570 --> 01:47:56,760
Yeah.
That's how fake it is.

2521
01:47:56,980 --> 01:47:59,430
So with the gene set,
with a kiss reality show,

2522
01:47:59,431 --> 01:48:02,430
there was like a mini series wral or it 
might be an ongoing show.

2523
01:48:02,490 --> 01:48:07,490
They have to create some drama,
so what are their following around and 

2524
01:48:07,490 --> 01:48:07,710
eric singer who's dressed like peter is 
like,

2525
01:48:07,830 --> 01:48:11,160
Jean,
can I do beth in the for the next show?

2526
01:48:11,161 --> 01:48:12,600
And then jeans,
all you know,

2527
01:48:12,870 --> 01:48:15,030
a promise,
peter that we wouldn't do beth.

2528
01:48:15,031 --> 01:48:16,920
I don't know if like,
come on dude,

2529
01:48:16,921 --> 01:48:19,500
let me do bath.
So then eric singer disappears.

2530
01:48:19,620 --> 01:48:21,240
They're about to do a show.
Where's eric singer?

2531
01:48:21,270 --> 01:48:24,150
We started an hour.
No one's been able to find them all.

2532
01:48:24,210 --> 01:48:25,590
They're all looking for uyghur singer.
He's like,

2533
01:48:25,670 --> 01:48:30,670
fuck it.
Let's get the roadie and get them and 

2534
01:48:30,670 --> 01:48:32,271
makeup we're going to get.
We're just going to do the show without 

2535
01:48:32,271 --> 01:48:32,271
them.

2536
01:48:32,271 --> 01:48:34,520
We're going to get the ready to do it.
They never show the roadie putting on 

2537
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:34,520
makeup or anything getting ready.
THey were just like,

2538
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:39,200
oh man.
And then all of a sudden eric shows up 

2539
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:40,971
backstage.
He's all dressed up and makeup and he 

2540
01:48:40,971 --> 01:48:43,131
goes,
they're going onstage and he looks over 

2541
01:48:43,131 --> 01:48:45,411
to peter goes or to paul.
Stanley is gene can lmp two path or not 

2542
01:48:45,411 --> 01:48:45,411
in paul goes,
bro,

2543
01:48:45,411 --> 01:48:46,230
Just get up on stage,
man.

2544
01:48:46,231 --> 01:48:47,850
I don't think so.
Something like that.

2545
01:48:48,190 --> 01:48:50,770
It's all ridiculous,
dude.

2546
01:48:50,790 --> 01:48:53,730
Fake drama and then he sings it.
I don't.

2547
01:48:53,731 --> 01:48:55,020
I don't.
I didn't even get that far.

2548
01:48:55,050 --> 01:48:56,940
It was ridiculous.
It was ridiculous,

2549
01:48:56,941 --> 01:49:01,941
man.
Having them argue backstage about 

2550
01:49:01,941 --> 01:49:01,941
singing.
Beth,

2551
01:49:04,140 --> 01:49:06,480
is there a way to do a reality show and 
not have fake shit?

2552
01:49:07,430 --> 01:49:10,230
No editing allowed.
It's just one camera.

2553
01:49:10,250 --> 01:49:12,000
it is,
but it might not be interesting.

2554
01:49:12,180 --> 01:49:12,540
Yeah.

2555
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:16,230
You gotta have it.
Got three cameras to some people.

2556
01:49:16,231 --> 01:49:18,960
I'd rather watch an hour that I know is 
100 percent real than an hour.

2557
01:49:18,961 --> 01:49:20,810
That's like you said,
have just chopped up.

2558
01:49:21,310 --> 01:49:26,310
So that should insults the fuck out of 
me when I watched like keeping up with 

2559
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:30,531
the kardashians and I see bruce jenner 
running around town trying to fucking 

2560
01:49:30,531 --> 01:49:32,100
meet a deadline or something stupid 
where I know it's not real and like,

2561
01:49:32,101 --> 01:49:37,101
come on man,
the fake show on my shit is done just 

2562
01:49:37,101 --> 01:49:37,101
all out of fun,
man.

2563
01:49:37,101 --> 01:49:38,880
We want it fake.
We do those fake.

2564
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:44,080
We do.
We're storing a facial reactions and 

2565
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:45,810
stuff from people just putting them in.
We're having fun with it.

2566
01:49:45,870 --> 01:49:47,930
It's like all things.
What he's talking about is a

2567
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:52,980
10th planet jiu jitsu.
Dotcom has got a thing called mastering 

2568
01:49:52,980 --> 01:49:53,500
the system and it's like a fake jujitsu 
reality show,

2569
01:49:55,010 --> 01:49:57,120
but there's real,
real techniques in there.

2570
01:49:57,350 --> 01:50:02,350
I real techniques,
but we just have fun with stan with 

2571
01:50:02,350 --> 01:50:02,470
shenanigans.
That's hilarious.

2572
01:50:03,650 --> 01:50:04,950
Is the whole,
uh,

2573
01:50:05,620 --> 01:50:07,690
an auto thing?
What is the deal with that?

2574
01:50:07,691 --> 01:50:08,200
Is that.
Oh,

2575
01:50:08,201 --> 01:50:10,780
the latest episode that just went up.
He chokes me up.

2576
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:14,340
We get in a fight and he talks about and
it puts out any leaves people.

2577
01:50:14,380 --> 01:50:19,380
Have people figured out what's going on 
yet or do people think it's the most 

2578
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:20,650
people know it's fake,
but there's a small percentage.

2579
01:50:20,651 --> 01:50:23,770
Like I just got someone,
a forum member from the day one.

2580
01:50:23,860 --> 01:50:26,080
This girl emailed me yesterday,
said,

2581
01:50:26,590 --> 01:50:27,040
I,
you know,

2582
01:50:27,041 --> 01:50:29,710
I respect your you to death and all 
that,

2583
01:50:29,711 --> 01:50:32,590
but I have to know once and for all,
is the helper thing real?

2584
01:50:33,270 --> 01:50:34,360
She goes,
I just got a note.

2585
01:50:34,420 --> 01:50:35,560
Either way,
if it's real,

2586
01:50:35,561 --> 01:50:36,340
it's real,
it's cool.

2587
01:50:36,341 --> 01:50:38,080
But if it's fake,
just let me know.

2588
01:50:38,081 --> 01:50:39,660
I just don't know.
Like,

2589
01:50:39,661 --> 01:50:41,020
wow,
you don't know.

2590
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:43,420
You know,
there's so much evidence.

2591
01:50:43,421 --> 01:50:48,421
People are piecing together,
they're taking footage of the days of 

2592
01:50:48,421 --> 01:50:49,240
our lives.
They're putting it on a forum and I just

2593
01:50:49,241 --> 01:50:50,470
keep deleting it.
Any,

2594
01:50:50,471 --> 01:50:52,460
any evidence?
I just delete it.

2595
01:50:52,461 --> 01:50:53,920
Just delete it.
It's a tricky thing,

2596
01:50:53,921 --> 01:50:55,000
man.
When people fake it,

2597
01:50:55,300 --> 01:50:58,000
when people fake anything.
You know that video I just saw the other

2598
01:50:58,001 --> 01:51:01,090
day of a alan belcher,
a pumpkin.

2599
01:51:01,091 --> 01:51:06,091
You.
You ever see that video after you've 

2600
01:51:06,091 --> 01:51:06,091
seen it?
You haven't seen it.

2601
01:51:06,091 --> 01:51:09,610
There's a video of you punking him at 
your school and then he punks.

2602
01:51:09,611 --> 01:51:14,611
You remember that was columbus,
philadelphia,

2603
01:51:14,980 --> 01:51:16,030
somewhere.
Somewhere.

2604
01:51:16,060 --> 01:51:18,850
But he got you.
I knew it right away.

2605
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:19,990
I was like,
no fucking way.

2606
01:51:20,050 --> 01:51:22,290
I just thought he was crazy because this
guy's nuts.

2607
01:51:22,450 --> 01:51:24,060
I wasn't hearing what he was saying.
I was just going,

2608
01:51:24,390 --> 01:51:29,390
oh,
I guess I always start like the first 

2609
01:51:29,390 --> 01:51:30,340
time I ever met alan belcher,
it was after an awesome victory.

2610
01:51:30,341 --> 01:51:32,440
I talked to him a little bit and invited
them into my school.

2611
01:51:32,740 --> 01:51:33,620
I thought he was like,
uh,

2612
01:51:33,850 --> 01:51:35,380
I got mad.
This guy can snap.

2613
01:51:35,381 --> 01:51:37,980
He was seemed like a snapper.
I keep just like I seen.

2614
01:51:37,990 --> 01:51:38,590
I'm like,
damn,

2615
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:40,810
I'm like a little scared of him.
I didn't really know it.

2616
01:51:40,811 --> 01:51:43,330
Just in the first time we met,
he had just beat someone's ass.

2617
01:51:43,331 --> 01:51:45,010
His lip was all fucked up and it was 
quivering.

2618
01:51:45,180 --> 01:51:47,020
You got to cut live and it was quivering
and I'm like,

2619
01:51:47,350 --> 01:51:47,740
man,
I'm like,

2620
01:51:47,741 --> 01:51:48,820
dude,
I would love to show you some,

2621
01:51:48,910 --> 01:51:53,910
some rubber guard shit you know,
and come on down to the gym and I for a 

2622
01:51:53,910 --> 01:51:54,370
second,
I thought,

2623
01:51:54,371 --> 01:51:55,090
man,
this guy,

2624
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:56,350
he could snap on him.

2625
01:51:56,890 --> 01:51:58,530
He ended up being a super fucking 
sweetheart.

2626
01:51:58,540 --> 01:52:00,100
He's totally cool.
I love alan belcher,

2627
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:03,250
but when he tried to punk me,
what was the premise of it?

2628
01:52:03,251 --> 01:52:04,990
I don't even remember.
He got mad about something.

2629
01:52:05,020 --> 01:52:10,020
I don't remember,
but I remember as soon as it started 

2630
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:10,020
coming,
as soon as it happened,

2631
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:10,020
he was screaming.
I turned to the camera,

2632
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:12,790
went no.
like he was trying to fight you.

2633
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:13,200
No,
no,

2634
01:52:13,270 --> 01:52:15,340
it wasn't me.
I was on the outside.

2635
01:52:15,540 --> 01:52:20,540
I was on the outside.
You and you were trying to keep him for 

2636
01:52:20,540 --> 01:52:22,831
getting mad about something and he was.
I think he was going to start a fight 

2637
01:52:22,831 --> 01:52:24,310
with a bouncer or something.
He was getting nuts with a bouncer and I

2638
01:52:24,311 --> 01:52:25,120
was going,
oh no,

2639
01:52:25,121 --> 01:52:26,670
fuck.
We got a crazy amount of fucking.

2640
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:32,160
He's gonna fight a bouncer right now,
but that is a problem if you hang out 

2641
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:34,270
with a certain number of mma fighters.
There's a few,

2642
01:52:34,490 --> 01:52:36,700
you know,
always one or two that's a loose cannon.

2643
01:52:36,940 --> 01:52:38,630
You never know.
A couple of drinks getting.

2644
01:52:38,660 --> 01:52:42,160
I'm shaking and that Judy Browning was 
at my school last night.

2645
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:45,530
Oh,
he's totally cool,

2646
01:52:45,531 --> 01:52:46,190
man.
I love

2647
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:48,740
Judy Browning,
but before I actually met him,

2648
01:52:49,250 --> 01:52:52,940
he was the only guy ever that I saw on 
the ultimate fighter and you know,

2649
01:52:52,970 --> 01:52:57,970
we're always backstage running into 
these guys all the time and that new 

2650
01:52:57,970 --> 01:52:57,970
season comes on.
I go,

2651
01:52:57,970 --> 01:53:02,591
oh,
I got to remember these dudes because I 

2652
01:53:02,591 --> 01:53:02,591
want to be running to him all the time.
I don't want to not know their names and

2653
01:53:02,591 --> 01:53:04,520
feel like a total douche bag.
So I'm like this.

2654
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:08,330
I'm like watching the show,
studying their fighting techniques,

2655
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:11,390
seeing what kind of fighter they are and
what kind of personality they have.

2656
01:53:11,420 --> 01:53:13,160
One,
they showed joni browning on top.

2657
01:53:13,550 --> 01:53:14,900
I thought to myself,
man,

2658
01:53:15,260 --> 01:53:19,370
this guy can snap on anybody.
I don't want to get to know this guy.

2659
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:23,330
I made the decision in my head,
don't get close to that guy.

2660
01:53:23,331 --> 01:53:28,331
That guy was holding in las vegas.
We're eating at nine and he was a really

2661
01:53:28,521 --> 01:53:31,610
nice guy and what happened was it was a 
big fan of yours and that's.

2662
01:53:31,820 --> 01:53:33,740
I tried to avoid him.
I didn't even want to talk to him.

2663
01:53:33,741 --> 01:53:36,410
I just talk from the show.
They made him seem like a total lunatic.

2664
01:53:36,411 --> 01:53:38,570
Right.
So I'm in.

2665
01:53:38,571 --> 01:53:43,571
Sean tompkins trained him and he just 
fuck somebody up and on spike show in 

2666
01:53:43,571 --> 01:53:47,441
vegas and we're at nine the places I see
sean pumpkin's walking towards me and 

2667
01:53:47,441 --> 01:53:48,700
I'm like,
I'd love sean tompkins.

2668
01:53:48,701 --> 01:53:50,550
So as soon as he came up I like,
you know,

2669
01:53:50,670 --> 01:53:55,670
we gave,
we gave each other a little hug and I 

2670
01:53:55,670 --> 01:53:55,670
saw that.
Oh damn.

2671
01:53:55,670 --> 01:53:55,880
Johnny brown is right behind him and his
buddy.

2672
01:53:56,090 --> 01:53:59,210
So I hugged sean tompkins and kind of 
look the other way,

2673
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:01,160
trying to pretend like I didn't notice 
any brownie.

2674
01:54:01,430 --> 01:54:02,450
I'm going,
fuck man.

2675
01:54:02,451 --> 01:54:03,880
Here he comes.
He's coming right for me.

2676
01:54:03,890 --> 01:54:05,150
Shit.
He's with sean tompkins.

2677
01:54:05,510 --> 01:54:08,420
I hear him right next to me.
It's like right over my shoulder.

2678
01:54:08,510 --> 01:54:11,290
And he almost passed me by booz buddied 
from Kentucky.

2679
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:11,600
Said,
hey,

2680
01:54:11,601 --> 01:54:13,040
there's eddie bravo.
And I'm like,

2681
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:14,420
oh shit,
he's going to come up.

2682
01:54:14,510 --> 01:54:16,940
So he tapped me on the shoulder and I 
looked over and I was,

2683
01:54:16,941 --> 01:54:18,140
hey dude,
what's going on dude?

2684
01:54:18,141 --> 01:54:19,370
Great fight.
Fuck.

2685
01:54:19,490 --> 01:54:20,600
And I'm thinking,
oh shit,

2686
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:23,000
I'm actually talking to him.
Holy shit.

2687
01:54:23,001 --> 01:54:24,530
What's going to happen?
And then he goes,

2688
01:54:24,531 --> 01:54:25,190
bro,
man,

2689
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:28,040
we're always studying your books and 
smoking weed and,

2690
01:54:28,340 --> 01:54:30,020
and um,
and uh,

2691
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:32,210
on the mat with your book out.
I do rubber guard.

2692
01:54:32,211 --> 01:54:33,890
I got a good twister.
And all of a sudden like,

2693
01:54:33,980 --> 01:54:35,570
whoa,
this guy's,

2694
01:54:35,810 --> 01:54:38,390
this guy's a 10th planet fan.
Like all of a sudden I got,

2695
01:54:38,391 --> 01:54:41,270
I got to get this guy a chance maybe.
Maybe I prejudged him.

2696
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:43,460
and he turned out to be a fucking cool 
guy,

2697
01:54:43,461 --> 01:54:47,180
man.
And he's thinking about moving to la and

2698
01:54:47,210 --> 01:54:48,230
to get away from vegas.

2699
01:54:48,230 --> 01:54:50,840
He's not partying anymore.
He just wants to clean up his life and,

2700
01:54:50,890 --> 01:54:51,620
and,
uh,

2701
01:54:51,740 --> 01:54:53,780
make a big combat.
Still a young kid,

2702
01:54:53,781 --> 01:54:54,260
right?
Isn't he?

2703
01:54:54,410 --> 01:54:57,560
And he's funny as hell too,
because when he's funny,

2704
01:54:57,650 --> 01:55:00,320
that motherfucker's funny.
He doesn't have to be drunk.

2705
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:03,410
After jujitsu.
We hung out in the parking lot and uh,

2706
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:06,470
he made all of us laugh quite a few 
times.

2707
01:55:06,471 --> 01:55:07,760
He's got some video shit,
man.

2708
01:55:07,890 --> 01:55:09,200
He's a cool dude.
He just,

2709
01:55:09,201 --> 01:55:10,640
you know,
he had a bad upbringing.

2710
01:55:10,641 --> 01:55:13,100
His dad used to beat the shit out of him
and you're going to come up,

2711
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:14,450
you're going to have order,
kinks,

2712
01:55:15,110 --> 01:55:15,980
kinks.
That's all.

2713
01:55:16,070 --> 01:55:16,460
I mean,
we've,

2714
01:55:16,610 --> 01:55:21,610
we've run into so many guys over the 
years that started out like that and 

2715
01:55:21,610 --> 01:55:21,750
then eventually got their shit together,
you know,

2716
01:55:21,770 --> 01:55:23,270
one way or another.
I mean,

2717
01:55:23,271 --> 01:55:28,271
it's fun to watch guys like that evolve 
and become something better than what 

2718
01:55:28,271 --> 01:55:28,271
they were like.
Chris,

2719
01:55:28,340 --> 01:55:33,340
a perfect example of guy started.
I was kind of a brawler and now he's 

2720
01:55:33,340 --> 01:55:34,490
like a fucking like after you put erin 
simpson away,

2721
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:38,080
he's like a seasoned motherfucker now.
Triangled akiyama.

2722
01:55:38,081 --> 01:55:39,020
Yeah.
For real.

2723
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:40,400
Chris stevens,
a bad man.

2724
01:55:40,401 --> 01:55:42,800
He's smart man and I believe that Judy 
Browning,

2725
01:55:42,801 --> 01:55:44,040
I believe that he's too

2726
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:46,290
smart to throw his life away.
He's not smart.

2727
01:55:46,291 --> 01:55:47,430
He's,
but he was an idiot.

2728
01:55:47,610 --> 01:55:49,410
He might.
He might just keep fucking hell.

2729
01:55:49,430 --> 01:55:51,740
You would benefit from hanging around 
human if he,

2730
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:56,800
if you understand troubled childhoods 
and channeling that shit into something 

2731
01:55:58,171 --> 01:56:00,420
positive and being around positive 
people,

2732
01:56:00,421 --> 01:56:02,140
man,
that's the most important thing to,

2733
01:56:02,220 --> 01:56:07,220
for having a positive life,
being around a bunch of other people 

2734
01:56:07,220 --> 01:56:08,850
that are on the same wavelength as you.
Trying to do the same shit.

2735
01:56:08,851 --> 01:56:13,851
And that's one of the cool things about 
a 10th planet jiu jitsu in hollywood is 

2736
01:56:13,851 --> 01:56:15,750
that everyone is super positive there 
and it all trickles down from,

2737
01:56:15,751 --> 01:56:17,270
you know.
Well,

2738
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:19,140
you know that right?
I mean it all trickles down from you.

2739
01:56:19,141 --> 01:56:24,141
I mean,
a lot of places if you go to there and 

2740
01:56:24,141 --> 01:56:26,210
the instructors kind of douchey and 
people can get douchey with each other 

2741
01:56:26,210 --> 01:56:26,730
and there's none of that at our place.

2742
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:31,760
Everybody's very cool.
All I'm doing really is acknowledging 

2743
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:33,300
that everyone has an ego.
I have an ego.

2744
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:38,360
Everybody has an ego and I just,
every day I tried to do things to keep 

2745
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:41,430
that ego in check because if I don't,
if I'm not consciously trying to keep it

2746
01:56:41,431 --> 01:56:44,430
in check,
sometimes it just pops up and fucks up.

2747
01:56:44,431 --> 01:56:45,690
You know what I mean?
So,

2748
01:56:46,410 --> 01:56:47,200
you know,
I,

2749
01:56:47,201 --> 01:56:48,470
I,
and the,

2750
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:51,360
it rubs off on my students.
My students are constantly,

2751
01:56:51,361 --> 01:56:53,190
you know,
like the ego flares up,

2752
01:56:53,500 --> 01:56:55,110
you know,
they can catch themselves,

2753
01:56:55,140 --> 01:56:58,110
they can correct themselves.
It's a lifelong process,

2754
01:56:58,111 --> 01:56:58,710
man,
that you know,

2755
01:56:58,711 --> 01:57:03,711
everybody has an ego and they,
everyone struggled with podcasts is a 

2756
01:57:03,711 --> 01:57:07,011
part of their two man.
I've talked to a bunch of people that 

2757
01:57:07,011 --> 01:57:10,311
I've met all over the world.
One of the most important ones was this 

2758
01:57:10,311 --> 01:57:10,560
kid that I met in boston who is from 
Ireland,

2759
01:57:10,980 --> 01:57:12,600
who was explaining that man.

2760
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:13,080
He goes,
I don't,

2761
01:57:13,110 --> 01:57:16,230
we don't have anybody like this near me.
No one talks like this.

2762
01:57:16,231 --> 01:57:21,231
No one gives us this.
There's no one around it that's a 

2763
01:57:21,231 --> 01:57:21,750
thinker this way that thinks about life 
this way.

2764
01:57:21,751 --> 01:57:26,751
It's openminded.
And he goes and because of this podcast 

2765
01:57:26,751 --> 01:57:29,271
is making me like,
like reassess the way I evaluate life 

2766
01:57:29,271 --> 01:57:30,600
and reassess the way I talk and think 
about things.

2767
01:57:30,810 --> 01:57:33,780
Having guys like you teaching jujitsu,
having a podcast like this,

2768
01:57:33,970 --> 01:57:35,160
like this,
like a serious,

2769
01:57:35,550 --> 01:57:38,760
like a serious connection we have to all
these people and they helped me too,

2770
01:57:38,761 --> 01:57:39,240
man.
I've,

2771
01:57:39,241 --> 01:57:44,241
I've gotten a bunch of cool tweets from 
people and inspirational shit and cool 

2772
01:57:44,241 --> 01:57:48,740
articles that people tweeted me and cool
things that people post on the message 

2773
01:57:48,740 --> 01:57:50,520
board and it's all like a big thing 
together.

2774
01:57:50,580 --> 01:57:52,200
You know?
It's all a big thing.

2775
01:57:52,201 --> 01:57:55,020
Everybody helping everybody else now.

2776
01:57:55,140 --> 01:57:58,050
It's so much fun.
Every day I drive to class,

2777
01:57:58,770 --> 01:58:01,510
I remind myself on the way to class and 
how lucky I am.

2778
01:58:01,511 --> 01:58:02,520
Like,
I'm dry,

2779
01:58:02,550 --> 01:58:03,800
this is my job.
I mean,

2780
01:58:03,810 --> 01:58:05,880
I didn't even look at like,
look at like a job,

2781
01:58:06,260 --> 01:58:08,190
look at like a job,
look at it like a job.

2782
01:58:08,191 --> 01:58:13,191
Sorry.
But I mean every day is a day off for 

2783
01:58:13,191 --> 01:58:13,191
me,
man.

2784
01:58:13,191 --> 01:58:16,460
And I appreciate so much just going to 
class and everyone's just sitting there 

2785
01:58:16,460 --> 01:58:19,250
and they're waiting for me to teach them
how to strangle like,

2786
01:58:19,940 --> 01:58:21,480
you know,
in an efficient way.

2787
01:58:21,750 --> 01:58:24,090
Like how fucking lucky am I.
I can't believe that every,

2788
01:58:24,190 --> 01:58:25,380
it's,
it's amazing.

2789
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:30,440
And the cool thing about jujitsu for 
people don't know is everybody's real 

2790
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:30,440
friendly to each other man.
I mean,

2791
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:33,280
people catch people all the time and,
and you know,

2792
01:58:33,290 --> 01:58:36,210
an arm bars and chokes and shit like 
that and you know,

2793
01:58:36,211 --> 01:58:38,380
you don't want to get caught,
but there's no,

2794
01:58:38,410 --> 01:58:40,980
no fights ever breakout,
no bullshit ever happens.

2795
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:42,010
It's all just,
you

2796
01:58:42,020 --> 01:58:42,480
know,
damn,

2797
01:58:42,490 --> 01:58:43,210
I got caught.
Hi,

2798
01:58:43,211 --> 01:58:44,950
what did I do wrong?
Or you forgot to put your arm in.

2799
01:58:44,980 --> 01:58:46,240
Oh shit.
Oh thank you.

2800
01:58:46,460 --> 01:58:51,460
And you know,
it's a massive misconception about 

2801
01:58:51,460 --> 01:58:55,231
jujitsu,
that jujitsu classes or a bunch of meat 

2802
01:58:55,231 --> 01:58:55,231
heads,
they're douchebags dick heads.

2803
01:58:55,231 --> 01:58:59,881
And She would think it's like we trained
in a cage and it's a bunch of computer 

2804
01:58:59,881 --> 01:59:04,381
nerds that,
that are playing the ultimate virtual 

2805
01:59:04,381 --> 01:59:07,861
reality game because if you're into 
video games and like killing someone by 

2806
01:59:07,861 --> 01:59:08,320
pressing a button,
but no one's really dying,

2807
01:59:08,321 --> 01:59:09,820
but you enjoy that,
that feeling.

2808
01:59:10,030 --> 01:59:13,000
Jujitsu is the ultimate virtual reality 
video game.

2809
01:59:13,030 --> 01:59:16,450
It's where we is going to end up feeling
more like a baseball bat,

2810
01:59:16,451 --> 01:59:21,451
like a golf club.
How about you can can actually kill 

2811
01:59:21,451 --> 01:59:21,451
people,
you know,

2812
01:59:21,451 --> 01:59:24,430
theoretically or you know with jujitsu 
you put someone under choke,

2813
01:59:24,460 --> 01:59:29,460
they tap out.
It was like you killed them because of 

2814
01:59:29,460 --> 01:59:29,460
you didn't let them go.

2815
01:59:29,460 --> 01:59:31,360
You would actually kill them and you can
learn.

2816
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:34,300
You can anybody.
there's so many jujitsu schools all over

2817
01:59:34,301 --> 01:59:39,301
the world.
You can learn how to systematically and 

2818
01:59:39,301 --> 01:59:41,830
scientifically break limbs and put 
people to sleep.

2819
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:45,430
There's over 20 different ways you can 
put someone to sleep just with the neck.

2820
01:59:45,460 --> 01:59:46,870
You know,
there's probably more,

2821
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:48,370
I'm just guessing,
at least 20.

2822
01:59:48,550 --> 01:59:53,550
All of these different chunks.
So many different variations of 

2823
01:59:53,550 --> 01:59:55,630
guillotines doris as a chat and it 
becomes just a really fun game too.

2824
01:59:55,690 --> 02:00:00,690
It's an amazing guy killing game where,
I mean I hurt my arm like a couple of 

2825
02:00:01,301 --> 02:00:02,470
weeks ago,
you know,

2826
02:00:02,471 --> 02:00:06,760
but like you know,
for the most part when you get to go to,

2827
02:00:06,820 --> 02:00:08,550
you know,
get involved in like,

2828
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:12,490
like serious rolling with somebody.
Everybody's fine at when it's over,

2829
02:00:12,491 --> 02:00:13,990
you know,
you get caught with something,

2830
02:00:14,170 --> 02:00:17,080
he just tap and 99 percent of the time 
you're fine.

2831
02:00:17,290 --> 02:00:22,290
Every now and then you'll get something 
in something I'll get tweaked or you 

2832
02:00:22,290 --> 02:00:24,871
need to get twisted.
I know you had a knee problem that 

2833
02:00:24,871 --> 02:00:24,871
happened recently.
Both my are fucked up,

2834
02:00:24,871 --> 02:00:26,500
but it's so fun.
You never think about stopping doing it.

2835
02:00:26,501 --> 02:00:27,210
You just think,
man,

2836
02:00:27,211 --> 02:00:29,650
I can't wait for myself to heal up.
Exactly.

2837
02:00:29,651 --> 02:00:31,360
So I can get back in and you're like 
fuck.

2838
02:00:31,510 --> 02:00:36,510
Like when you,
when you tweak something or like god 

2839
02:00:36,510 --> 02:00:36,670
damn I probably out a couple of weeks 
and it's just fun.

2840
02:00:36,730 --> 02:00:38,560
It's so much fun.
I mean it's.

2841
02:00:39,160 --> 02:00:41,680
Think about this.
You have to work out.

2842
02:00:41,681 --> 02:00:43,780
Everybody has to work out.
If you're in perfect shape,

2843
02:00:43,781 --> 02:00:47,440
you have to maintain,
you have to keep working on why not work

2844
02:00:47,441 --> 02:00:52,441
out and learn how to take people out,
put them to sleep at the same time and 

2845
02:00:53,561 --> 02:00:55,510
it's and it's the ultimate video game.

2846
02:00:55,820 --> 02:00:59,080
It's exercise.
You learn some serious self defense.

2847
02:00:59,081 --> 02:01:04,081
It can come up at any time in your life.
It's valuable and it gives you so much 

2848
02:01:04,081 --> 02:01:06,730
confidence and it's so much fun.
It's kills video games.

2849
02:01:07,090 --> 02:01:09,700
It's like there's anything.
You meet a lot of great people that have

2850
02:01:09,701 --> 02:01:13,480
their ego in check because if,
if you don't have your ego in check,

2851
02:01:13,810 --> 02:01:18,240
then those people don't survive jujitsu.
That tapping is that ego?

2852
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:23,320
A douche bag filter.
The tapping because dudes that are just 

2853
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:25,560
just there,
it's where their eagle rules.

2854
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:28,150
They can't jump on the mat and get 
tapped out.

2855
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:30,730
They run from it or they get on the edge
of the mats are like,

2856
02:01:30,731 --> 02:01:35,731
no way am I going to let people tap me 
out and they don't really don't know 

2857
02:01:35,731 --> 02:01:36,010
what's going on,
but subconsciously,

2858
02:01:36,160 --> 02:01:39,160
the fear of being dominated and tapping 
out by losing,

2859
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:40,330
looking like a week

2860
02:01:40,330 --> 02:01:45,330
lane that scares people away.
You got to look at it like you're just 

2861
02:01:45,330 --> 02:01:45,330
learning.
You.

2862
02:01:45,330 --> 02:01:48,760
Of course you're going to get tapped out
in the beginning and the more the more 

2863
02:01:48,760 --> 02:01:48,760
you come,
the more dedicated you are.

2864
02:01:48,770 --> 02:01:53,770
As time passes,
you start tapping dudes out 

2865
02:01:53,770 --> 02:01:53,770
occasionally,
but still,

2866
02:01:53,770 --> 02:01:55,910
you're usually tapping or beginner,
but ultimately one or two years,

2867
02:01:56,030 --> 02:01:57,000
man,
you,

2868
02:01:57,100 --> 02:02:01,250
you can minimize those taps and you're 
getting your learning.

2869
02:02:01,430 --> 02:02:03,020
If you did,
you just jitsu for two years,

2870
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:06,110
the odds are in a street fight one on 
one.

2871
02:02:06,230 --> 02:02:10,050
The odds are way on your side way on 
your side.

2872
02:02:10,051 --> 02:02:12,920
If you know anybody could,
anything could happen in a street fight,

2873
02:02:12,921 --> 02:02:17,921
but man,
a guy that's trained jujitsu two years 

2874
02:02:17,921 --> 02:02:17,921
against the guy who has zero training on
the ground.

2875
02:02:18,830 --> 02:02:23,830
Another great aspect of it is it a calms
down your body and it makes you realize 

2876
02:02:23,830 --> 02:02:27,431
how much of an influence stress and just
the fact that we have this ancient 

2877
02:02:27,431 --> 02:02:31,270
chimpanzee hardware in our system,
our bodies are set up for hunting and 

2878
02:02:31,270 --> 02:02:34,871
gathering and carrying things and our 
bodies are set up to exert a certain 

2879
02:02:34,871 --> 02:02:38,591
amount of energy and if you don't exert 
a certain amount of energy with your 

2880
02:02:38,591 --> 02:02:41,411
body,
your body starts to betray you and you 

2881
02:02:41,411 --> 02:02:43,511
start to get really stressful and you 
start to snap at things they wouldn't 

2882
02:02:43,511 --> 02:02:43,511
ordinarily snap out.

2883
02:02:43,511 --> 02:02:45,170
Oh,
you shouldn't rationally be upset about.

2884
02:02:45,320 --> 02:02:47,030
It allows you to put things into 
perspective.

2885
02:02:47,031 --> 02:02:49,790
It calms your body down.
I was very important,

2886
02:02:49,791 --> 02:02:50,120
man.
Yeah,

2887
02:02:50,270 --> 02:02:55,270
I mean,
are you saying Jujitsu is better than 

2888
02:02:55,270 --> 02:02:55,270
quake?
Are you going to start that?

2889
02:02:55,550 --> 02:03:00,550
There's a bunch of people put a bunch of
videos of cool video games that are out 

2890
02:03:00,550 --> 02:03:00,550
there,
man.

2891
02:03:00,550 --> 02:03:00,680
Fuck.
You know,

2892
02:03:00,681 --> 02:03:02,930
lIke to try to tell me that there's all 
these different video games.

2893
02:03:03,140 --> 02:03:04,640
Man.
There's some insane shit.

2894
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:06,650
There's this one,
I don't know the name of it,

2895
02:03:06,651 --> 02:03:11,651
but they were.
It was like it looked like they were in 

2896
02:03:11,651 --> 02:03:13,691
the jungle and they were like near 
something like it looks like some mayan 

2897
02:03:13,691 --> 02:03:14,480
temples and shed.
The graphics are insane.

2898
02:03:14,481 --> 02:03:16,160
Rushing attack.
I don't know what it is,

2899
02:03:16,161 --> 02:03:17,180
man.
I don't know what it is.

2900
02:03:17,181 --> 02:03:22,181
I don't remember what someone put just a
demo up and then someone put crisis out 

2901
02:03:22,220 --> 02:03:22,420
of it.

2902
02:03:22,820 --> 02:03:27,820
I don't know what it was,
but at the demo was insane and then 

2903
02:03:27,820 --> 02:03:27,820
crisis was another one that was pretty 
interesting.

2904
02:03:27,820 --> 02:03:29,180
A bunch of dudes runnIng around shooting
people,

2905
02:03:29,330 --> 02:03:33,470
but then I put a video of went to watch 
a video of quake online and I go back to

2906
02:03:33,471 --> 02:03:38,471
what I said nothing could fuck real 
quick because I understand that these 

2907
02:03:38,471 --> 02:03:42,250
games are beautiful.
I understand these games have all these 

2908
02:03:42,250 --> 02:03:44,801
cool things you can do quick for.
All I want to do is fuck people up in 

2909
02:03:45,801 --> 02:03:47,990
one-on-one death matches.
That's what I like to do,

2910
02:03:48,020 --> 02:03:52,010
but yet you're not even talking to.
I understand what you're saying,

2911
02:03:52,011 --> 02:03:52,350
man.
No,

2912
02:03:52,370 --> 02:03:53,930
I'm just saying that if you like death 
matches,

2913
02:03:54,020 --> 02:03:57,950
they've taken that the formula of death 
match and it just added onto it for like

2914
02:03:57,980 --> 02:04:00,070
the last 15,
20 years or whatever.

2915
02:04:00,110 --> 02:04:00,930
How long?
Well,

2916
02:04:00,950 --> 02:04:04,040
quake three was a quick four was 2000 
something.

2917
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:07,190
It was like 2005 or 2007,
so for the last five,

2918
02:04:07,200 --> 02:04:11,030
six on my number,
but they've taken the formula.

2919
02:04:11,031 --> 02:04:16,031
They even use the same engine on call of
duty when it first came out and they've 

2920
02:04:16,031 --> 02:04:19,571
just improved it and proved it and 
proved it and like a lot of these games 

2921
02:04:19,571 --> 02:04:22,511
that like last week I was talking about 
like keyboard and mouse necessarily is 

2922
02:04:22,511 --> 02:04:25,130
better than controller argument.
My point is is that the games are better

2923
02:04:25,131 --> 02:04:26,610
now.
The games are better now.

2924
02:04:26,640 --> 02:04:31,640
They're not geared towards the accuracy 
of a keyboard and mouse as much as they 

2925
02:04:31,640 --> 02:04:32,810
are geared for just having a fun 
experience.

2926
02:04:33,740 --> 02:04:35,400
Yeah,
there's a lot of auto wave going on.

2927
02:04:37,880 --> 02:04:41,070
It's just easier to.
People still do those driving games.

2928
02:04:41,071 --> 02:04:41,640
Yeah.
Yeah,

2929
02:04:42,240 --> 02:04:43,080
totally.
To me though,

2930
02:04:43,081 --> 02:04:45,570
the what,
what's fun to me about video games.

2931
02:04:45,690 --> 02:04:47,730
I understand all that,
but what's fun to me,

2932
02:04:47,731 --> 02:04:52,731
it's just I got addicted straight up to 
one on one matches and even like the 

2933
02:04:53,220 --> 02:04:54,330
death matches,
you know,

2934
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:59,360
just the fact that you have this 
incredibly precise control over the 

2935
02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:03,021
eight year,
more like the pool statistic version of 

2936
02:05:03,021 --> 02:05:05,390
video games.
I mean it's all just a very small 

2937
02:05:05,390 --> 02:05:05,390
majority.
Yeah.

2938
02:05:05,390 --> 02:05:07,650
Most people like to play football games 
and the control is perfect for that.

2939
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:11,070
With quick games,
those one-on-one first person shooters.

2940
02:05:11,071 --> 02:05:13,350
It's just so precise.
It's so addictive.

2941
02:05:13,351 --> 02:05:14,160
Man.
When you were talking about,

2942
02:05:14,190 --> 02:05:16,590
was your cousin's addicted to know my 
nephew,

2943
02:05:16,591 --> 02:05:17,520
nephew,
man.

2944
02:05:17,521 --> 02:05:19,720
When I was a little kid,
if he hit me with some quake,

2945
02:05:19,721 --> 02:05:20,630
I would have lost my life.

2946
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:22,080
I would have never got into martial 
arts.

2947
02:05:22,081 --> 02:05:24,420
I would have never got productive with 
my life.

2948
02:05:24,450 --> 02:05:25,890
I would have never paid attention in 
school.

2949
02:05:25,940 --> 02:05:30,940
Joe.
There's a game on steam that you can 

2950
02:05:30,940 --> 02:05:30,940
play on your mac that has nothing to do 
with it,

2951
02:05:30,940 --> 02:05:32,850
but I want you to.
Next time you're bored and you just want

2952
02:05:32,851 --> 02:05:35,550
to spend it because it's a really short 
game so you can't get addicted to it.

2953
02:05:35,870 --> 02:05:38,880
Like it's like literally you could beat 
it in like six hours really,

2954
02:05:38,940 --> 02:05:41,610
but it's called portal and I think ours,
jesus,

2955
02:05:41,611 --> 02:05:43,100
I ain't got six hours like our kids.
No,

2956
02:05:43,160 --> 02:05:48,160
I mean,
but six hours spread up for like a 

2957
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:48,160
month.
But that's a,

2958
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:48,160
that's an addiction.
You will that.

2959
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:50,660
That game alone will set your mind 
racing to wildland.

2960
02:05:50,670 --> 02:05:54,960
How crazy video games are nowadays.
So what is the best one right now?

2961
02:05:55,020 --> 02:06:00,020
If I wanted to get something for xbox 
and something that just got blow my 

2962
02:06:00,020 --> 02:06:00,020
fucking mind.

2963
02:06:00,020 --> 02:06:04,580
Here's a war for you.
I would probably go with more of like a 

2964
02:06:04,580 --> 02:06:08,430
borderlands or something like that,
but I would actually find a game that 

2965
02:06:08,430 --> 02:06:08,880
you could play on your mac.
You know,

2966
02:06:09,180 --> 02:06:11,580
like a game,
like call of duty that you can play.

2967
02:06:11,581 --> 02:06:15,870
I think he called dd four is on there 
and there's a couple scenes from call of

2968
02:06:15,871 --> 02:06:17,640
duty for that will blow your fucking 
mind.

2969
02:06:17,641 --> 02:06:19,830
You know red.
There's a red one,

2970
02:06:19,860 --> 02:06:22,470
red something cowboy one.
Don't get that shit.

2971
02:06:23,340 --> 02:06:25,890
That's just grand theft auto,
but using a horse and cowboy.

2972
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:30,920
What's it called?
It's called red dead dawn or something 

2973
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:30,920
like that.
I gave it a chance,

2974
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:30,920
but I was like,
all right,

2975
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:31,550
this is grand theft auto.
I don't wanna play anymore.

2976
02:06:31,620 --> 02:06:33,480
That was a hugely successful game 
though.

2977
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:34,540
Super.
You know,

2978
02:06:34,541 --> 02:06:39,541
it's just people like that formula and 
I'm sure it's bigger and better than 

2979
02:06:39,541 --> 02:06:42,771
grand theft auto,
but for me I just played it and I'm 

2980
02:06:42,771 --> 02:06:42,771
like,
I'm done with that.

2981
02:06:42,771 --> 02:06:43,320
I don't want to play that anymore.
I'm over that.

2982
02:06:43,380 --> 02:06:45,810
They say that ea martial arts game is a 
bust.

2983
02:06:46,170 --> 02:06:49,180
Nobody's buying it.
Really haven't played the us.

2984
02:06:49,260 --> 02:06:52,180
Do you have like a good one?
Cool.

2985
02:06:53,030 --> 02:06:54,640
The new one that we're working on right 
now,

2986
02:06:55,550 --> 02:06:56,970
who thinks it is?

2987
02:06:57,650 --> 02:06:58,880
What the fuck?
Pick up the phone.

2988
02:06:58,890 --> 02:07:00,200
Cock sucker.
That's not what happened.

2989
02:07:00,380 --> 02:07:05,380
Go back to that Alex Jones transcript.
Your calls.

2990
02:07:09,750 --> 02:07:12,510
Brian brian.
Callum must've just gotten to the tank,

2991
02:07:13,010 --> 02:07:15,500
but before we're going to do the 
podcast,

2992
02:07:15,501 --> 02:07:16,880
he was about getting a tank for the 
first time.

2993
02:07:16,970 --> 02:07:18,630
It was brian here.
No,

2994
02:07:18,631 --> 02:07:19,380
not here.
No.

2995
02:07:19,470 --> 02:07:22,980
At a place in venice.
The headquarters float lab.com.

2996
02:07:24,330 --> 02:07:27,620
So I think what we got today is that 
eddie bravo loves ufos.

2997
02:07:28,020 --> 02:07:29,600
I love them.
And jujitsu.

2998
02:07:29,640 --> 02:07:34,640
I love them.
Like bunnies and brian loves cats and 

2999
02:07:34,640 --> 02:07:36,760
one hit of weed instead of three.
You got to hard today.

3000
02:07:36,820 --> 02:07:37,210
No,
no,

3001
02:07:37,211 --> 02:07:39,850
I'm just saying tHat I liked my high 
high today.

3002
02:07:39,910 --> 02:07:41,590
One hit that.
I think that's all I need.

3003
02:07:41,591 --> 02:07:43,960
No more than two and two if they're 
going to be too.

3004
02:07:43,961 --> 02:07:45,190
It's too light.
Ones your shit.

3005
02:07:45,220 --> 02:07:46,720
Fucking fuck me up this week.
and by the way,

3006
02:07:46,721 --> 02:07:49,370
like he,
like we smoked before we went on stage,

3007
02:07:49,630 --> 02:07:51,100
actually smashed.
Talk about that.

3008
02:07:51,160 --> 02:07:54,940
We smoked and then joey diaz told me 
five minutes later going,

3009
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:56,710
oh well I might put you up on stage and 
I'm like,

3010
02:07:56,711 --> 02:07:57,030
what?

3011
02:07:57,270 --> 02:07:59,050
I'm going up.
Sold out joe rogan show.

3012
02:07:59,051 --> 02:08:00,420
No,
it.

3013
02:08:00,460 --> 02:08:03,190
Uh,
so I was completely baked out of my mind

3014
02:08:03,191 --> 02:08:05,290
the first couple of days,
but we dId this weekend.

3015
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:07,870
It was different was we took str on the 
road.

3016
02:08:07,900 --> 02:08:09,770
Who's little esther was brian's friend 
who's a,

3017
02:08:10,070 --> 02:08:12,460
um,
an emerging standup comedian in la.

3018
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:17,520
And she's only 22 years old,
he's only been doing comedy like two 

3019
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:17,520
years and we just said,
well,

3020
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:20,440
let's just fucking just for an 
experiment,

3021
02:08:20,620 --> 02:08:23,380
see what it's like to take this kid and 
throw her up in front of a real crowd.

3022
02:08:23,381 --> 02:08:24,400
Like she did.
Great.

3023
02:08:24,430 --> 02:08:26,080
Yeah.
[inaudible] dot com.

3024
02:08:26,081 --> 02:08:27,850
Dude.
She's fucking good man.

3025
02:08:27,851 --> 02:08:32,851
She's confident and smooth.
And for someone who's only been doing 

3026
02:08:32,851 --> 02:08:36,271
comedy for two years,
she's way better than I was two years 

3027
02:08:36,271 --> 02:08:36,271
into it.
And I told her that when I was two years

3028
02:08:36,271 --> 02:08:36,760
into it,
I was a mess.

3029
02:08:36,760 --> 02:08:41,760
I was a clunky fucking goofy mass.
Is it okay that she's had she known for 

3030
02:08:42,521 --> 02:08:43,840
looking really young?
YeaH,

3031
02:08:44,150 --> 02:08:46,630
that's her characters.
She looks like she's 12.

3032
02:08:46,631 --> 02:08:47,930
Seriously.
What's her name?

3033
02:08:47,940 --> 02:08:50,200
Esther.
Little test or little esther.

3034
02:08:50,230 --> 02:08:52,960
Her feet seriously are smaller than my 
hands,

3035
02:08:53,020 --> 02:08:54,780
but smelled like they're twice as big.
Well,

3036
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:56,060
just kidding.
Get the fuck man.

3037
02:08:56,550 --> 02:08:58,360
She's thrown under the bus.
She's,

3038
02:08:58,450 --> 02:09:00,250
she's funny man.
She was furious.

3039
02:09:00,340 --> 02:09:02,110
She did a good job.
And you did a good job too,

3040
02:09:02,111 --> 02:09:07,111
man.
It was interesting watching you loosen 

3041
02:09:07,111 --> 02:09:09,061
up from the first set you did on 
thursday night to the last set you did 

3042
02:09:09,061 --> 02:09:09,061
on saturday night,
which was your best one,

3043
02:09:09,061 --> 02:09:11,010
right?
You slow to admit to your jetta.

3044
02:09:11,011 --> 02:09:13,960
That second set.
Saturday I acted like I smoked marijuana

3045
02:09:13,961 --> 02:09:16,240
before I went onstage before I went on 
stage,

3046
02:09:16,930 --> 02:09:18,900
the second chat.
Remember before we all,

3047
02:09:18,901 --> 02:09:20,890
we all didn't really smoke out because I
was like,

3048
02:09:20,900 --> 02:09:22,180
no,
do it,

3049
02:09:22,181 --> 02:09:22,480
do it.

3050
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:22,990
And I'm like,
no,

3051
02:09:22,991 --> 02:09:24,880
I don't want.
So the data show that you had,

3052
02:09:24,881 --> 02:09:27,490
was the one where you weren't high,
you went high at all?

3053
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:32,520
No,
it must've been a little high from the 

3054
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:32,520
first time,
but that was like,

3055
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:33,100
it had leveled off because you were 
nervous.

3056
02:09:33,410 --> 02:09:35,350
Weed isn't that great when You're 
nervous man.

3057
02:09:35,351 --> 02:09:37,150
And he realized that that you were 
probably,

3058
02:09:37,151 --> 02:09:42,151
you hide got paranoid and I was getting 
high like and then going on stage like 

3059
02:09:42,151 --> 02:09:43,520
five minutes later.
That's not a good mix for me,

3060
02:09:43,530 --> 02:09:48,530
adam.
It's not good mixture of the podcast 

3061
02:09:48,530 --> 02:09:50,131
either before we've done that.
Many times we get high right before we 

3062
02:09:50,131 --> 02:09:50,131
do the podcasts,
like today,

3063
02:09:50,131 --> 02:09:55,080
first words out of my mouth while I 
crawls and they don't come out that 

3064
02:09:55,080 --> 02:09:55,080
good.
Right.

3065
02:09:55,080 --> 02:09:59,400
But like right now or two hours in,
it's all smooth and once you're killing 

3066
02:09:59,400 --> 02:10:01,030
and you're really confident you can't 
wait to go on state.

3067
02:10:01,180 --> 02:10:02,890
Then the weed will take it through the 
roof.

3068
02:10:02,950 --> 02:10:07,950
Yeah.
But even then you gotta make sure you 

3069
02:10:07,950 --> 02:10:07,950
don't get too hard.
I think red bull and vodka,

3070
02:10:07,950 --> 02:10:11,371
what are one or two of them before on 
stage is the key ingredient for standup 

3071
02:10:11,371 --> 02:10:11,740
comedy?
One or two red bull's and vodka.

3072
02:10:12,010 --> 02:10:15,010
Red bull vodka.
I like a little bit of weed.

3073
02:10:15,250 --> 02:10:20,250
Some calisthenics.
My best teaching always comes from me 

3074
02:10:20,250 --> 02:10:23,590
being high when I teach because I'm so 
confident with it that it adds to it.

3075
02:10:23,740 --> 02:10:25,440
Like I'll be pissed off.
Like if I forget,

3076
02:10:25,690 --> 02:10:26,900
if I forget,
like I forgot.

3077
02:10:27,070 --> 02:10:32,070
I don't have lead right now and I didn't
teach class today stoned this morning.

3078
02:10:32,650 --> 02:10:34,580
I didn't teach guide.
I felt pretty good.

3079
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:39,640
I mean if it was a good class,
but I always feel like when I'm high 

3080
02:10:39,640 --> 02:10:40,790
it's just like I don't want a class to 
end.

3081
02:10:40,820 --> 02:10:42,680
I want her to keep going.
I want more time.

3082
02:10:42,681 --> 02:10:44,420
When I'm in that space,
in that zone,

3083
02:10:44,421 --> 02:10:45,350
like shit,
I'm running out of time.

3084
02:10:45,351 --> 02:10:48,830
There's so much I've got to say and show
when we don't show.

3085
02:10:49,130 --> 02:10:51,330
We got high in the car right before we 
went in there.

3086
02:10:53,180 --> 02:10:56,030
We want like three.
Here's Alex Jones show would be cool.

3087
02:10:56,031 --> 02:10:56,690
High though.
Well,

3088
02:10:56,760 --> 02:10:59,390
it's bewildering though because when we 
walked in,

3089
02:10:59,420 --> 02:11:00,170
no,
I walked in.

3090
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:03,710
Joe there about two d a devalue the 
dollar.

3091
02:11:03,711 --> 02:11:07,090
They're going to take the dollar way.
It's been proven to your forbes there.

3092
02:11:07,240 --> 02:11:12,240
Their ex rang your home.
They're driving by and vans and they're 

3093
02:11:12,240 --> 02:11:16,541
taking photos.
You irradiating your house with deadly 

3094
02:11:16,541 --> 02:11:17,970
radiation that can give cancer.
He's poor people,

3095
02:11:18,250 --> 02:11:20,990
so it's like you go from right out of 
the car.

3096
02:11:20,991 --> 02:11:22,700
Everybody's laughing.
We're talking shit.

3097
02:11:22,820 --> 02:11:27,820
We're breaking down country music.
There was like some ridiculous country 

3098
02:11:27,820 --> 02:11:27,820
music song,
you know,

3099
02:11:27,820 --> 02:11:31,811
below only girls make the best lovers.
We were laughing our asses off and then 

3100
02:11:33,351 --> 02:11:35,630
you go right in their death,
destruction,

3101
02:11:35,780 --> 02:11:39,380
new world order.
He leads global warming.

3102
02:11:39,550 --> 02:11:44,550
What was he saying about the radiation 
and is a crazy fucking real thing 

3103
02:11:44,801 --> 02:11:49,801
they're doing where they're driving 
through neighborhoods and they're 

3104
02:11:49,801 --> 02:11:52,741
blasting these cars with these super 
powerful x rays from these vans and 

3105
02:11:53,231 --> 02:11:58,231
they're looking inside of vehicles.
They have photos of the show was in 

3106
02:11:58,231 --> 02:11:58,870
forbes magazine.
He pulls up the story and shows it to me

3107
02:11:58,871 --> 02:12:03,871
and they're doing it to houses too.
They Just drive by and point this 

3108
02:12:03,871 --> 02:12:07,531
fucking crazy x ray gun at cars and see 
right through and they show all these 

3109
02:12:07,531 --> 02:12:09,610
photos of people looking at like bricks 
of cocaine.

3110
02:12:09,611 --> 02:12:12,340
The back of a van like this is nuts,
man.

3111
02:12:12,550 --> 02:12:13,330
Like they,
they can,

3112
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:15,670
they can shoot x-rays.
It just makes me,

3113
02:12:15,700 --> 02:12:19,630
it just makes me really wonder though 
how like people go on and the radiation,

3114
02:12:19,631 --> 02:12:24,631
like what exactly how strong it is 
because the other day I was talking to 

3115
02:12:24,631 --> 02:12:25,360
my dentist and he said like,
you know,

3116
02:12:25,490 --> 02:12:30,490
uh,
this radiation is about equal to 

3117
02:12:30,490 --> 02:12:30,490
standing next to a microwave.

3118
02:12:30,490 --> 02:12:30,490
That's what he said.
Yeah.

3119
02:12:30,490 --> 02:12:31,010
Something like that.
I forgot.

3120
02:12:31,040 --> 02:12:33,730
I don't know what to where a lead vest 
when you microwaves or popcorn.

3121
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:35,800
I don't know.
I don't know what that's for,

3122
02:12:35,801 --> 02:12:37,360
but that he said it's not that big a 
deal.

3123
02:12:37,361 --> 02:12:38,770
that's why he's not wearing the lead 
vest,

3124
02:12:38,771 --> 02:12:41,160
you know?
And well the crazy thing is that there's

3125
02:12:41,170 --> 02:12:46,170
radiation around us all the time.
Make yourself space microWaving your 

3126
02:12:46,170 --> 02:12:50,791
brain every time you put up.
No one knows what's happening with 

3127
02:12:50,791 --> 02:12:50,791
those.
Right?

3128
02:12:50,791 --> 02:12:53,670
Yeah.
So what happens though when you're in 

3129
02:12:53,670 --> 02:12:53,670
your car though,
and you got a hands free,

3130
02:12:53,670 --> 02:12:53,670
is that okay?
Well,

3131
02:12:53,670 --> 02:12:55,340
not when you have your phone between 
your crotch when you're tryIng to cook.

3132
02:12:55,380 --> 02:12:58,120
And it was a study released recently 
that.

3133
02:12:58,121 --> 02:13:00,100
So that laptops cook your balls.
Oh yeah.

3134
02:13:00,130 --> 02:13:00,900
Cook your sperm.
That's,

3135
02:13:00,930 --> 02:13:03,640
that's totally makes sperm and 
effective.

3136
02:13:03,940 --> 02:13:05,770
If you have your laptop on your lap.
Yeah.

3137
02:13:05,771 --> 02:13:08,330
You cook in your balls but not up there.
No,

3138
02:13:08,350 --> 02:13:08,860
no,
no,

3139
02:13:08,900 --> 02:13:10,200
no.
He did.

3140
02:13:10,230 --> 02:13:13,750
He cook shit balls.
I never put my laptop on my lap.

3141
02:13:14,740 --> 02:13:16,560
Yeah,
I got this thing for that very reason.

3142
02:13:16,561 --> 02:13:19,310
So I got this little pad that sits on 
the laptop.

3143
02:13:19,311 --> 02:13:22,030
It makes them more comfortable anyway 
because the bottom is soft,

3144
02:13:22,031 --> 02:13:27,031
so it sort of molds to your legs and 
with that note you got that italian 

3145
02:13:27,160 --> 02:13:27,840
song.
No,

3146
02:13:27,870 --> 02:13:32,070
it wasn't.
It says find youtube user does not

3147
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:34,440
allow mobile views or something like 
that.

3148
02:13:37,560 --> 02:13:38,570
So sorry.
Is this.

3149
02:13:38,860 --> 02:13:40,770
It would have been the perfect ending.
What is this?

3150
02:13:40,771 --> 02:13:42,090
Your plan?
Fatboy slim again,

3151
02:13:42,270 --> 02:13:43,710
another fatboy slim,
but at the same thing,

3152
02:13:43,711 --> 02:13:44,820
it's like,
it sounds like you love him.

3153
02:13:44,850 --> 02:13:46,560
It's like a two hour.
If you go to his website,

3154
02:13:46,561 --> 02:13:49,170
it's called fatboy slim summer mix and 
it's just a free download.

3155
02:13:49,171 --> 02:13:50,520
It's like a.
I think you'd love him.

3156
02:13:50,521 --> 02:13:51,760
Like eddie loves.
You have photos?

3157
02:13:51,870 --> 02:13:54,420
I think I do too.
Not that much.

3158
02:13:55,240 --> 02:13:56,160
