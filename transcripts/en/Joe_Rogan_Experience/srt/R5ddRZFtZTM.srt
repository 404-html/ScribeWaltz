1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,350
And less gay boom.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,730
we're live.
Alonzo Bowden.

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,080
How are you man?
What is up,

4
00:00:11,081 --> 00:00:12,860
Joe?
I'm grateful and somber times.

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,010
These are the weirdest fucking times 
ever.

6
00:00:15,011 --> 00:00:18,630
Rip to Tom Petty A.
I guess we have to say that too,

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,403
obviously

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,730
this time.
And,

9
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:27,510
and like everyone's been saying again,
you know what I mean?

10
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:28,770
It's like,
here we go again.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,200
Another go again,
another mass shooting.

12
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,820
And the,
the.

13
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,810
I think the most disturbing graphic to 
me was the scorecard.

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,700
Like they showed like this guy got 58 
and then the guy in Orlando got what?

15
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:44,670
40 something.
And so because it's like,

16
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:45,803
okay,
you just encouraged the next cycle to 

17
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:50,610
try to set the record.
You know what I mean?

18
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:51,444
Like,
like,

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,433
it shouldn't be.
There has to be another way to say it 

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,890
without giving publicity to he killed 
more than anybody else.

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,993
Yeah.
Know.

22
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,920
Well,
for everybody's listening in the future,

23
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,400
this is taking place.
We're recording this on Tuesday.

24
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,573
Uh,
the massacre happened in Las Vegas on 

25
00:01:09,331 --> 00:01:12,510
Sunday,
so it's just a couple of days ago and we

26
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:14,380
were just going over all the details of 
it.

27
00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:15,930
I'm,
I'm reading online here,

28
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,200
he killed 59 people injured,
527,

29
00:01:19,201 --> 00:01:24,201
which is just fucking completely insane.
I mean 527 people shot.

30
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:28,080
Is that right?
Or is that like,

31
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,670
does that count?
People trampled?

32
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,023
I think it,
it includes people trample them injured 

33
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:35,600
otherwise,
but there were a hell of a lot of people

34
00:01:35,601 --> 00:01:36,434
shot.
I mean he opened up with automatic 

35
00:01:37,991 --> 00:01:42,010
weapons into a crowd of thousands of 
people to where probably,

36
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:43,900
you know,
did any bullets hit the ground?

37
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,793
Like there were so many people if this 
thing that every bullet probably hit 

38
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,400
somebody.
Yeah.

39
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,234
You know,
probably or more than one person 

40
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:54,370
dependent.
I don't know the power of the ballistics

41
00:01:54,371 --> 00:01:55,600
of the weapon,
but.

42
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,340
Oh yeah,
he definitely,

43
00:01:57,341 --> 00:01:59,520
like bullets could have went through one
guy in Texas.

44
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,990
I'm sure they did.
I'm 100 percent.

45
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,170
This guy,
first of all,

46
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,090
there's a,
you know,

47
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,650
everybody's a,
becomes a big gun control argument,

48
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:11,620
which it should be right?
But uh,

49
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,150
one thing that we got to really take 
into considerations,

50
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,033
he had an illegal guns.
These guns were illegal I think for 25 

51
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:19,280
years.
So this isn't,

52
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,730
I don't know how much of this could have
been helped by making it more illegal.

53
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:25,720
Yeah.
It,

54
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,570
you know,
that's always a debate first.

55
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,413
The first problem is what was going on 
yesterday when they say this is not the 

56
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:35,120
time to talk about guns.
Of course it is.

57
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:35,831
And it did.
Yeah,

58
00:02:35,831 --> 00:02:38,380
of course it's the exact time to talk 
about guns and,

59
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,233
and,
and I'm not a gun guy in the sense that 

60
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,244
I'm not a gun owner,
but I get it with guys who are into 

61
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:45,754
guns.
I always compare it to my love of cars 

62
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:50,410
and bikes or anything mechanical or 
whatever.

63
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:52,510
I understand it but,
but the people,

64
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,373
most of the people I talked to who loved
guns don't have a problem with like 

65
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,780
registration certainly don't have a 
problem with education and,

66
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,693
and what I call common sense gun 
ownership and that there is some guns 

67
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,480
that I get it.
You want,

68
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:10,150
there are some guns that you know,
and again,

69
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:14,110
I'm not speaking with any expertise,
but from the layman's point of view,

70
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:14,944
it's like,
why do you need the semiautomatic 

71
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,250
military style weapon in,
in,

72
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,310
uh,
you know,

73
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,710
don't tell me you have it for hunting or
anything else.

74
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,430
Like if there's a reason you want to 
collect it,

75
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:30,220
just like if there's a reason you want 
to own a race car,

76
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:31,150
right?
And somebody says,

77
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,400
why do you need a car that does 200 
miles an hour?

78
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,620
Well,
you may have a reason you want that race

79
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:37,780
car,
but you don't use it on the street.

80
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:41,040
You can't take it out onto the streets.
And I.

81
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:41,883
and I think that should be that there 
should be some kind of rule with that 

82
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:46,960
kind of weapon that if.
Here's the thing,

83
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:48,280
it doesn't matter if there's a rule.
This guy,

84
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,680
there were plenty of rules.
Yeah,

85
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,050
that guy violated all the rules that 
this guy did.

86
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,860
But I'm just talking about the general 
attitude towards sales.

87
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:01,861
Just the idea that you can walk into a 
store and buy these weapons.

88
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,700
It should somehow be more difficult to,
you know,

89
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,140
and again this is my opinion,
right,

90
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:11,830
but I think it should be more difficult 
to buy a weapon of that tight.

91
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,630
Yeah.
Well these are all illegal weapons.

92
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,530
This guy,
this guy shot,

93
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,060
converted them to fully automatic and 
fully automatics illegal everywhere.

94
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:20,720
Right.
Here's what's fucked up about this guy.

95
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:24,010
This guy didn't have a criminal record.
He had no army training,

96
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,040
no religious or political affiliation 
affiliations.

97
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,290
No one has any idea what his motives 
were.

98
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,080
He was wealthy.
He's a big time high roller,

99
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,330
which is how he got this giant suite in 
Vegas.

100
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,570
I mean,
it is fucking bizarre.

101
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:39,610
Did you see his brother get interviewed?
Yeah.

102
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,361
Yeah.
And,

103
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:41,050
and it,
it's.

104
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:41,890
Well,
it's,

105
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,383
that's the thing about this,
that's the thing about this kind of 

106
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:46,570
insanity,
right?

107
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,613
There is usually no outward like that.
Like how many people are like this in 

108
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:53,990
this country that we don't know about?
Yeah.

109
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,170
You know what I mean?
That have as,

110
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,540
and particularly if you're wealthy,
if you're wealthy,

111
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,970
it's so much easier to hide it,
right?

112
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,120
Because you may have a big house,
you may have a compound,

113
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:05,170
you may have a,
you know,

114
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:08,170
a camp,
a place you go camping in the woods,

115
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,090
units actually stocked with,
you know,

116
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:15,130
a 100 weapons or something like that.
I mean that the randomness of this,

117
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,340
to me that is the biggest horror.
The worst thing about this to me is just

118
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:23,020
the idea.
Like you went to a fucking concert,

119
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,340
right?
Like that's all you did.

120
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,700
You went to a concert in Vegas and 
you're never coming home.

121
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,760
Your family's destroyed everything.
And I mean,

122
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,213
and,
and that is the utter randomness of it 

123
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,830
that you can't control.
Well,

124
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:37,480
that's what's terrifying about it.
This,

125
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,630
which is really strange to me,
the definition of terrorist.

126
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,630
Nobody's calling this guy a terrorist.
Like what?

127
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,733
Do you have to be like,
political or religious to be a 

128
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:48,790
terrorist?
Like how the fuck this guy.

129
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,850
Not a terribly.
Yes,

130
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,733
this is definitely terror.
This is definitely terror because you 

131
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:58,190
know why it's terrible because now are 
you going to go to a big event in Vegas?

132
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,110
Are you going to go to a big outdoor 
con?

133
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:00,944
You know,
Vegas does these music festivals in 

134
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:03,614
front of these towers and if someone 
could do something like this and the 

135
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:07,334
end,
the pools,

136
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,370
you know,
they have those giant Edm parties at the

137
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:11,204
pool all summer that are literally 
surrounded by the Tower of whatever 

138
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:15,704
hotel you're in so next.
So that's why it's terror because now 

139
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,900
you have to be afraid to do that.

140
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,671
Well,
not only that,

141
00:06:21,671 --> 00:06:22,504
like this,
now they're going to have some sort of 

142
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:28,660
screening when you go into hotels,
which by the way,

143
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,790
why the fuck didn't they have them 
already?

144
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,840
How I've always thought this.
The airports are so stringent,

145
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,390
like you go through the airports,
they check your Dick.

146
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,910
They literally will pat your Dick if you
hit a random,

147
00:06:39,911 --> 00:06:40,570
you know,
being.

148
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,800
I'm sorry sir,
we got to check your day,

149
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,680
your random.
And they literally put the back of their

150
00:06:44,681 --> 00:06:45,514
hand because it was really odd to me 
that it's okay to touch your Dick with 

151
00:06:48,221 --> 00:06:53,221
the back of your back.
The less sensitive they get to smooth it

152
00:06:54,521 --> 00:06:55,600
down.
No,

153
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,060
that's so weird.
Like it's okay sir.

154
00:06:58,061 --> 00:07:01,330
I'm just using the back of my hand to 
touch your Dick like we might have had.

155
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,670
They might've had them grabbing and some
guy was just like,

156
00:07:03,671 --> 00:07:05,110
I'm not grabbing a hard dick.

157
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,960
There's no doubt it was them.
They got the union,

158
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:08,863
the other guy,
like I'm not getting my dick hard by 

159
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:15,811
some guy who's looking for a weapon.
It's just weird that they can do that.

160
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,910
But if you go through the airport,
right,

161
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:22,150
like airports we've decided are places 
where terror exists,

162
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:23,580
right?
So you have like,

163
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,270
like I have Tsa Pre med,
I have a,

164
00:07:27,271 --> 00:07:28,104
um,
a global entry and all of that have a 

165
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,950
clear,
clear is the best.

166
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,810
Queer is the best way.
Of course.

167
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,940
Yeah.
Yeah.

168
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,840
What a habit.
Yeah.

169
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:39,340
You just put your fingers down.
Bam.

170
00:07:39,341 --> 00:07:40,630
It's got a picture of you go right 
through.

171
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,680
It takes two seconds,
right?

172
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:42,514
Yeah.
But that's just a place where we've 

173
00:07:44,741 --> 00:07:46,690
decided you have terror.
Right.

174
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,780
And now are we going to decide that you 
have terror everywhere?

175
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,140
No,
I don't think so.

176
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:52,250
I mean,
for one thing,

177
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:52,960
I,
I'm,

178
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,793
I'm not buying into the hotel argument.
Like there's a bigger issue here than 

179
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:58,394
the hotels and,
and the issue is the weapons and what 

180
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:05,801
can we do about the proliferation?
Proliferation of weapons proliferation.

181
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,230
Proliferation of weapons.
Yeah.

182
00:08:08,231 --> 00:08:10,290
Sorry about that.
You started.

183
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,230
Where did you go?
Oh,

184
00:08:11,231 --> 00:08:14,630
I'm too deep into this word.
I got too deep into a word now.

185
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:17,300
There's no backing out all the damn 
weapons.

186
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:17,900
No,
but that.

187
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,270
But that's the issue.
The thing about hotels though,

188
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,780
and this been in the United States,
the privacy issue is huge,

189
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:24,614
right?
Your hotel room is basically your home 

190
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,440
away from home.
When do you get what other privacy rules

191
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,390
of checking what you bring into a hotel.
What's in your hotel room room?

192
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,730
I remember the um,
the stoplight cameras,

193
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:38,923
right?
Yes.

194
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,853
And they got sued and people got in 
trouble because they got that picture 

195
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:45,680
taken and the wrong person was in their 
car.

196
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:46,514
Right?
So it's.

197
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,730
That chick wasn't,
his wife dies.

198
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,660
Yeah.
Or this guy wasn't his husband.

199
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:53,930
One guy sued because he,
the picture was taken.

200
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,250
The woman wasn't his.
They send the ticket

201
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,083
to your house,
right?

202
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,140
He got into A.
Yeah,

203
00:08:58,141 --> 00:08:59,690
exactly.
And,

204
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,490
and he won the suit in the sense that 
you're,

205
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,870
there's a level of privacy that's 
expected in your cost.

206
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,600
Do you understand why that it's illegal 
though,

207
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,790
because it's a third party.
It's not actually.

208
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,800
Even the government,
they farmed it off.

209
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,833
They say on some other company that's 
sending you a ticket and charging you 

210
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,144
money.
Right.

211
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,410
And everybody was like,
well,

212
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:20,244
what do you guys are having your hiring 
people to do this commissioning a place 

213
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:26,070
to write tickets,
which they had to do.

214
00:09:26,071 --> 00:09:29,580
They had to rename the cameras to only 
hit the license plate.

215
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,940
But that's not true because I got one 
the other day you got showed you sent me

216
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:36,170
a picture of me smiling.
Well it's not little cocky.

217
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,890
Tried to go right on red flashed me.
But.

218
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,753
But the point being in your hotel room,
like there's an expectation of privacy 

219
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,450
and and where is that line drawn?

220
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,283
The other big difference to be drawn in 
Vegas because people get freaky in 

221
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:52,494
Vegas.
Yeah.

222
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,390
Right.
The other big difference,

223
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:56,490
and I'll tell you a vegas story about 
that.

224
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:57,600
That's great.
I heard.

225
00:09:57,601 --> 00:10:00,540
But the other big differences when 
you're on an airplane,

226
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:05,490
your trapped in that airplane when 
you're in a hotel like you can run,

227
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,800
you know what I mean?
You can order it on down the stairs.

228
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,780
You can,
you really know you,

229
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:10,614
you compared to being in an airplane.
But I think it's a valid comparison 

230
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,470
honestly.
I mean it's like you're still in a box,

231
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,470
you're in it,
you're in a confined space.

232
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:22,930
But I think it's easier to escape.
Now the thing about about Vegas,

233
00:10:22,931 --> 00:10:23,764
this guy told me who was a security guy,
he said the thing about the cameras is 

234
00:10:27,351 --> 00:10:29,010
you,
you see who's with who?

235
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,443
And then there was one particular guy 
that kept singing but he kept bringing 

236
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,540
transgender hookers to his room and like
they knew who he was.

237
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,640
He was like a famous guy and they were 
like,

238
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,720
yeah,
we can,

239
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,200
we could destroy this guy if we wanted.
We got.

240
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,390
Because they got cameras everywhere in 
Vegas,

241
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:47,820
right?
They know who's coming upstairs room.

242
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:49,240
They know what room they're going to 
get.

243
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,530
Like super obvious transgender ones 
like,

244
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,433
yeah,
like the giant football player you guys 

245
00:10:56,641 --> 00:10:59,430
felt like you dresses on.
So,

246
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:00,300
uh,
you know,

247
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,310
so I had to give up that hobby.
No,

248
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,330
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

249
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,210
That's the only thing from this podcast 
that's going to go out viral.

250
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,423
We knew it.

251
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,523
Well.
Here's another thing that is a giant 

252
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:13,150
issue that,
uh,

253
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,810
haven't heard discussed at all.
Mental health.

254
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,820
And this is really what this is all 
about.

255
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,713
This is,
I mean this is a gun issue in the sense 

256
00:11:20,911 --> 00:11:21,744
that he used guns,
but then is it a truck issue in Nice 

257
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:26,460
France where that guy just drove into 
those people?

258
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,810
I mean,
is it a.

259
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,703
I mean,
there's a ton of different ways to kill 

260
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:30,504
people and I'm sure we're going to see 
more of these fucked up ways in the 

261
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:33,534
future,
but the real issue is a mental health 

262
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,790
issue.
Now this guy,

263
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:42,600
his dad was a psychopath.
He was a serial bank robber.

264
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,450
He spent eight years on the FBI's most 
wanted list.

265
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,580
Here's the question,
right?

266
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:51,780
Like is that genetic?
Like does that transfer over?

267
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,090
Like how does that work?
It

268
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:54,923
could be genetic,
it could be that psychological thing of 

269
00:11:58,261 --> 00:12:01,110
I want to outdo my dad,
this,

270
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,590
this guy could be.
I mean,

271
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,960
no,
this guy's a millionaire.

272
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,701
Right.
And so on.

273
00:12:04,701 --> 00:12:05,534
Like,
so he,

274
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:09,510
he's obviously a high achiever,
but he could have that whole,

275
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:11,610
I'm not kidding.
You could have that hole where he always

276
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:15,840
wanted to do something bigger than his 
dad or he wanted some approval,

277
00:12:15,841 --> 00:12:19,230
you know what I mean?
Some weird kind of approval thing.

278
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,970
Yeah,
I guess that's just speculation,

279
00:12:20,971 --> 00:12:21,360
right,
man?

280
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,930
Yeah.
I mean you could speculate a,

281
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,780
you know,
a bunch our mental health issue,

282
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,240
just a health issue in this country that
that's a show unto itself,

283
00:12:30,241 --> 00:12:31,074
right?
We don't,

284
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,660
we don't take care of ourselves.
We don't take care of people.

285
00:12:33,661 --> 00:12:37,780
We don't provide for the mental health,
the mental health problem.

286
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,770
You look downtown in any city in 
America,

287
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,020
wandering the streets,
homeless.

288
00:12:43,021 --> 00:12:47,340
You got schizophrenia and,
and all kinds of people and you know,

289
00:12:47,341 --> 00:12:49,400
God forbid they got weapons,
you know,

290
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,260
who knows,
like you talk about the other ways.

291
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,380
I'm sure there are attacks that we just 
don't hear about.

292
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,363
You know where some guy goes nuts with a
knife or a broken bottle and whatever 

293
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:00,680
else,

294
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,513
man,
that's one of the big things that 

295
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,280
happens in places that have stricter gun
control and the argument would be that,

296
00:13:05,281 --> 00:13:05,880
hey,
you know,

297
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,660
that's safer for the people.
It's easier to handle.

298
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,503
There's more things that you can do.
Some guy with a machine gun going down 

299
00:13:14,491 --> 00:13:16,050
all these people.
But again,

300
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,140
gun control's not really gonna help 
this,

301
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:19,974
this guy was using illegal guns.
I mean the issue at this point is that 

302
00:13:24,481 --> 00:13:28,230
there's so many guns out there,
like even if you made guns illegal,

303
00:13:28,231 --> 00:13:31,050
what are we going to sweep?
Are we going to go house to house?

304
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,410
And if we do sweep and go house to 
house,

305
00:13:34,411 --> 00:13:35,244
man,
people are going to resist that because 

306
00:13:36,811 --> 00:13:41,080
for every one of these psychopaths that 
winds up shooting people and,

307
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:42,480
and,
and gunning someone down,

308
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,153
there's going to be genuine normal 
people that want a gun to protect their 

309
00:13:47,281 --> 00:13:48,114
family.
Maybe they live in a sketchy 

310
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,450
neighborhood and then all of a sudden 
the government comes along and says,

311
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,700
well,
now it's illegal for you to possess that

312
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:55,380
gun.
Well then who has guns?

313
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,020
Well,
we're already criminals.

314
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,270
See,
I think the solution is in between and I

315
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:02,170
think this is another one where we get,
you know,

316
00:14:02,171 --> 00:14:05,660
this is a problem we have and I can't 
even say when it started,

317
00:14:05,661 --> 00:14:09,890
when you have the two sides and it's 
either or so either you know,

318
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,733
no gun regulations or,
or far too many gun regulations and I 

319
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:16,310
think the solution is somewhere in 
between,

320
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:20,090
in my opinion.
It's always been like why can't we treat

321
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:22,220
them like cars.
Like when you buy a car,

322
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,870
you registered the car,
right?

323
00:14:23,871 --> 00:14:27,140
So the government knows like Joe knows 
Joe has this car,

324
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,110
right?
And then when you,

325
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,103
you have to have insurance in case 
something goes wrong with the car and 

326
00:14:31,851 --> 00:14:35,300
you hurt somebody and then if you sell 
the car to me,

327
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,190
you tell the government,
hey,

328
00:14:37,191 --> 00:14:40,670
I just sold the car to Alonzo.
I'm no longer liable for this car,

329
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,340
Alonzo's liable for this car.
And I go,

330
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:48,430
I've always thought that would be the 
level of common sense gun registration.

331
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:49,900
Well here's another one.
Okay.

332
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,920
Along with that,
with guns,

333
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:52,190
you don't really have to know how to use
them

334
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,820
is where they really fucked up things 
about.

335
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,430
Unfortunately

336
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,640
if you drive a car,
you have to take tests,

337
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,070
you have to pass,
you have to understand the registration,

338
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,830
the rules rather.
I mean you have to,

339
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,380
you have to go and a guy has a sit next 
to you,

340
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,570
you have to go through a driver's test

341
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,560
and I don't see why we can't do that 
with guns.

342
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,290
You should absolutely.
You have to go to a range and show,

343
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:15,530
you know,
like the safety of using a gun and,

344
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:17,330
and how to shoot it.
You know,

345
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:18,980
I don't,
I don't see why we can't do that.

346
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:21,020
And even if your family teaches you,
right,

347
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:21,854
they say like in a lot of places you 
grow up with guns and as a kid your dad 

348
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,543
teaches you.
Well,

349
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:30,110
if your dad teaches you to drive,
you still have to go to DMV and take the

350
00:15:30,111 --> 00:15:32,060
test.
So it's like your dad,

351
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:32,894
your mom,
whoever your uncle could teach you to 

352
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,600
shoot,
but you still,

353
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,530
there should be some,
some level of testing to,

354
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,710
to get an idea because we have,
you know,

355
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,583
just a couple of weeks ago where you had
a four year old in Florida who was 

356
00:15:46,401 --> 00:15:47,234
looking in their grandmother's purse for
candy and shot themselves and it's like 

357
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:55,010
that grandma,
there's a safety issue with the gun.

358
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:59,510
Like you don't tell the kid to go get 
some candy when you know you have a gun.

359
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,493
I think there's a nutty number,
like 21 people a year killed in this 

360
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:04,940
country by arm.
Toddlers.

361
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:05,921
Yeah.
Yeah.

362
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:07,360
I believe it.
I believe it.

363
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,283
Find out what the number is.

364
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,770
I think it's 21.
People were shot to death by babies.

365
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,390
Yeah.
Any of the other thing is.

366
00:16:13,391 --> 00:16:14,224
And you brought it up like how okay,
if we didn't have guns then they'd be 

367
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:17,450
killing,
you know,

368
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,940
with knives or clubs or something like,
just that idea that,

369
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,100
that we have to have that discussion 
like,

370
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,293
well,
what weapon or the mass killer is going 

371
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:27,630
to use?
That in itself is insane.

372
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,060
Just the fact that we're like,
yeah,

373
00:16:30,061 --> 00:16:31,660
we're going to have these mass killers.
We,

374
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,170
we gotta have them working with 
different weapons.

375
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:34,981
Uh,
I don't,

376
00:16:34,981 --> 00:16:37,980
I don't know on the mental health I,
I'm,

377
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:42,120
I'm not even going to pretend to have 
the expertise to talk about what it is,

378
00:16:42,121 --> 00:16:44,280
but it's an issue that we don't spend 
money on.

379
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,970
It's an issue not covered by a lot of 
insurance.

380
00:16:47,971 --> 00:16:51,810
A lot of insurance doesn't cover any 
kind of mental health care.

381
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:53,723
Here's the thing,
even if it does cover mean a giant 

382
00:16:56,581 --> 00:17:00,690
percentage of the people that commit 
these giant mass shootings are either on

383
00:17:00,691 --> 00:17:01,524
psychoactive medication or are having 
withdrawals from psychoactive 

384
00:17:05,461 --> 00:17:07,530
medication.
So even if your insurance covers it,

385
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,490
even if you're medicated by a doctor,
there's like,

386
00:17:11,491 --> 00:17:12,324
there's a disassociative quality 
apparently with a lot of these 

387
00:17:14,941 --> 00:17:15,774
antidepressants and anti psychotic 
medications that people take that with 

388
00:17:18,931 --> 00:17:21,660
the right combination of biology,
circumstances,

389
00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:22,860
genetics,
whatever it is.

390
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,180
People just can snap and they don't have
an issue.

391
00:17:27,181 --> 00:17:28,020
I mean,
what,

392
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,730
what are the numbers of people that are 
on that stuff?

393
00:17:29,731 --> 00:17:30,564
A giant number.
What are the numbers of people that 

394
00:17:31,891 --> 00:17:34,230
actually wind up and go and do 
shootings?

395
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,101
Much,
much,

396
00:17:35,101 --> 00:17:35,701
much,
much,

397
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:36,534
much smaller number,
but it's enough that if it happens once 

398
00:17:39,421 --> 00:17:42,210
a year like Orlando last year and then 
this year in Vegas,

399
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,210
I mean,
what the Fuck Nigga again,

400
00:17:45,211 --> 00:17:48,330
we don't know why this guy did this.
We have no idea if he was on anything,

401
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,190
but what the fuck is

402
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,130
it that we have to do to stop this stuff
from happening?

403
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,120
Well,
I mean,

404
00:17:54,121 --> 00:17:56,220
I'm sure there were scientists who study
it and all,

405
00:17:56,221 --> 00:17:59,610
but I can't imagine people that can do,
can predict it.

406
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,880
People are getting shot by toddlers on a
weekly basis this year.

407
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,450
Trust Jesus Christ.
How many people have killed themselves?

408
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:07,284
18 more injured themselves.
10 injured other people to killed other 

409
00:18:10,861 --> 00:18:12,960
people.
That was in 2015

410
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,833
last year.

411
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,100
Toddlers have killed at least shot at 
least 23 people this year.

412
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,050
Jesus fucking Christ.
Five months.

413
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,250
Oh my God.
Okay,

414
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:29,280
so we can't,
we cannot match that with no argument of

415
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:32,000
toddler drivers having run over.
People know.

416
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,010
Well irresponsible gun owners.
That is.

417
00:18:35,011 --> 00:18:35,791
And,
and again,

418
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:39,480
that gets back to what you're saying,
the education,

419
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:40,314
like learn to own a gun safely to keep 
it somewhere where a toddlers not going 

420
00:18:44,111 --> 00:18:45,450
to get to it.
Something.

421
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,520
Everything dangerous safely,
you know,

422
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,530
everything.
And isn't it funny how you,

423
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:51,990
you know,
we do kid proof a house,

424
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,160
like,
like,

425
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,993
you know,
they have some plastic things that go 

426
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:58,980
into the electrical sockets and the 
poison and this and that.

427
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,350
What about the gun?
Hey,

428
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,410
throw it in the candy drawer,
put it under your pillow.

429
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,580
Kid's never going to get there.
Yeah,

430
00:19:05,581 --> 00:19:06,020
I mean,
there,

431
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,530
there's a lot of responsibility.

432
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,413
I don't mean to laugh,
but I mean I'm laughing at the 

433
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:10,944
ridiculous of it and that,
and that is true and I think the vast 

434
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:16,470
majority of gun owners are,
are um,

435
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,640
responsible.
You know,

436
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:21,060
it is another group that's painted with 
the broad brush,

437
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:23,760
right?
That the few gun nuts,

438
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,720
crazy.
What the paint every NRA member as being

439
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:29,760
one of them.
And that isn't true.

440
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:30,721
You know,
like I said,

441
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:31,554
I know,
I know people love people who like guns 

442
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:37,740
and they're not that.
But the people who are not that happy to

443
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:41,670
accept the fact that there is a 
population that is that,

444
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,960
you know what I mean,
you,

445
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:45,780
you can't say that they don't exist 
because they do exist.

446
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:49,980
So a big part of this,
I think like any other issue,

447
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:50,814
Joe,
we got to start telling each other the 

448
00:19:52,481 --> 00:19:54,450
truth.
You know what I mean?

449
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,550
About,
about these issues.

450
00:19:56,551 --> 00:19:59,010
Like we,
everyone has their,

451
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,290
their side,
right,

452
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:05,300
or their tribe or their team and they 
refuse to believe any truth,

453
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,021
you know,
any,

454
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:10,290
any negative truth about their team or 
whatever.

455
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,124
You know what I mean?
Like,

456
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,470
like to say,
well,

457
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:15,120
like we were saying like gun owners.
Okay.

458
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:19,140
So there's responsible gun owners and 
then there's a few gun blog and just use

459
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:19,974
the term gun nuts.
And the responsible gun owners have to 

460
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:24,540
accept the fact that there was some gun 
nuts,

461
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:25,590
right?
With the police.

462
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:30,510
The vast majority of police are good,
but the good police have to say,

463
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,370
yeah,
there are some bad cops too.

464
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,920
You know what I mean?
Like within any,

465
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,090
within it,
any tribe.

466
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:39,480
We're comics.
We know there are some bad comics.

467
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:41,430
I don't know if you know what Joe,
but I'm going to put it out there.

468
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,280
I heard of him,
but,

469
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,100
but until we,
until we do,

470
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,160
we can never

471
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,540
have a real discussion.
Right?

472
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:53,410
Because everybody just suddenly circles 
the wagons around their hurt and like,

473
00:20:53,411 --> 00:20:53,741
no,
no,

474
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:54,450
no,
not really.

475
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,240
No.
It's like,

476
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,550
no,
we're not saying all of you are bad,

477
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,910
but let's admit within your group there 
is bad.

478
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:02,610
So we can work on that.
Yeah.

479
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,453
I've seen some tweets from some NRA 
supporters the last day and a half that 

480
00:21:07,061 --> 00:21:10,540
are just fucking stunned me were just 
shut the fuck up man.

481
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,603
Just really realize what the state of 
all this is right now and shut the fuck 

482
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:15,550
up.
And by the way,

483
00:21:15,551 --> 00:21:16,384
there's a video that's going around that
somebody put up about me talking about 

484
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:22,180
gun control is not a recent video.
I don't know when it's from,

485
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:25,150
but people are putting it up now about 
me,

486
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,280
uh,
destroying the gun control argument.

487
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,393
Uh,
it's,

488
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:32,050
it would be very insensitive for me to 
do that and to put that up right now.

489
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:33,580
And I didn't.
It had nothing to do with.

490
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,400
I don't know when it was,
I think it was from a year or so ago,

491
00:21:36,401 --> 00:21:39,790
but,
but the idea that these people,

492
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,863
these NRA supporters would go and tweet 
these pro gun messages and get crazy 

493
00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:47,320
with it now is exactly what you're 
saying.

494
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:49,600
They're digging their heels in their 
supporting their team.

495
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,361
Yeah.
And,

496
00:21:50,361 --> 00:21:53,990
and as many people have been saying and,
and it is a sad truth.

497
00:21:53,991 --> 00:21:54,824
Look,
if we didn't wake up after Sandy Hook 

498
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,650
then you know,
if,

499
00:21:58,651 --> 00:21:59,360
if,
if,

500
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,270
when 20,
was it 21 kids were shot.

501
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,143
Yeah.
That and people denied that it happened 

502
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:07,610
to,
Oh that didn't even happen at all that,

503
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,460
you know what I mean?
People are calling this a false flag.

504
00:22:10,461 --> 00:22:11,330
Right.
So,

505
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,260
so if that didn't wake us up,
yeah.

506
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,070
Then,
you know,

507
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:19,970
58 people at a music concert.
I hate to say it,

508
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,680
but it's like,
it's not going to wake us up.

509
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,121
You know,
I have,

510
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:24,800
I have a thing.
What Waking Sop mean?

511
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,670
You know,
I mean,

512
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,100
wake us up to the point of take some 
action,

513
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,310
but what's the,
of President Alonza,

514
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,550
what would you do the,
the,

515
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:33,410
um,
well,

516
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,510
to start with,
we have to have the conversation.

517
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,360
We have to have the conversation about.
They're just,

518
00:22:38,361 --> 00:22:41,960
like we just talked about.
There isn't a necessary.

519
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,160
It is necessary to change our gun laws 
are gun laws are too lax.

520
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,800
That's the first thing.
Then what we need to do,

521
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:49,843
we need to come up with a system just 
like we have with cars or anything else 

522
00:22:54,231 --> 00:22:58,010
dangerous where you,
you have to be trained to use it.

523
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,503
You have to register whatever it is with
the government and you have to have 

524
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:03,314
liability insurance and that and that,
that information transfer is like the 

525
00:23:08,061 --> 00:23:08,894
big loophole is the gun shows,
right where you go to the gun show and 

526
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:13,670
you could just sell a gun to another 
person.

527
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:17,570
You can do that with all the case in a 
lot of states that still the case.

528
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,670
You can do that with a car,
right?

529
00:23:19,671 --> 00:23:22,170
I can sell you my car through Craig's 
list,

530
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:25,910
but I'm still going to go put it in that
a liability thing.

531
00:23:25,911 --> 00:23:28,460
Otherwise I'm liable for what you do 
with the car.

532
00:23:28,461 --> 00:23:29,294
Like I protect myself by reporting it 
even though I sold it to you per party 

533
00:23:33,201 --> 00:23:34,160
to party.
Yeah.

534
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,900
So,
so yeah,

535
00:23:35,901 --> 00:23:37,160
if I'm in charge,
we're gonna,

536
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,630
we're gonna add those things.
We're going to get.

537
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,450
We're going to get a handle on these 
guns.

538
00:23:41,451 --> 00:23:44,390
We're going to get start tracking how 
many they are,

539
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,770
where they are,

540
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,450
we're going to collect them.
Um,

541
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,250
I think it was Australia and some other 
places that had those things were looked

542
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,350
Australia.
If you own an illegal weapon,

543
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:57,290
like a fully automatic weapon or 
whatever makes it illegal,

544
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:01,220
you can turn it in.
Maybe there's payment or maybe it's just

545
00:24:01,221 --> 00:24:04,190
no questions asked,
just turn it in and we'll,

546
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,540
we'll destroy it.
Well,

547
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:06,374
what happened in Australia as they had a
mass shooting and then they put their 

548
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:09,380
foot down and I said,
no,

549
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:12,030
Mark Australia just banned them 
altogether.

550
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,240
Totally random.
You can still use a rifle to hunt.

551
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,913
But um,
the way we have this sort of fast and 

552
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:19,514
loose,
there's very few countries in the world 

553
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,980
that have this kind of fast and loose 
gun policy.

554
00:24:24,981 --> 00:24:25,910
I think.
Yeah,

555
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:29,490
we still have the wild west mentality.
Well,

556
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:30,863
freedom mentality,
which bill o'reilly did a fucking had a 

557
00:24:33,831 --> 00:24:37,010
post today where he's talking about that
this is the cost of freight.

558
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:37,880
The freedom.
Yeah.

559
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,710
Fucking crazy.
No,

560
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:40,700
it's not.
No,

561
00:24:40,701 --> 00:24:43,190
it's not the old dickhead.
And I'll give you an example,

562
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:45,020
Joe.
Like I grew up in New York City,

563
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,170
like guns had been illegal in New York 
City for a long time.

564
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:52,550
Now there are guns in New York City,
but not as many as people think,

565
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,710
you know,
because what happens is when you make it

566
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,290
illegal,
then the average person,

567
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,060
they don't go out of their way to get a 
gun.

568
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,910
Now I'm not,
I'm not going to have one.

569
00:25:00,911 --> 00:25:02,330
Yeah,
a criminal is going to have guns.

570
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,130
Yes.
Criminals are always going to have guns.

571
00:25:04,131 --> 00:25:04,964
But you know,
the thing about the good guy shooting 

572
00:25:06,711 --> 00:25:09,470
the bad guy,
it doesn't happen that often.

573
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:14,990
And my personal belief on this is 
because in that moment it takes a lot to

574
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:16,670
shoot somebody.
It just happened the other day.

575
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,550
They just happened the other day saying 
that doesn't happen.

576
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:22,830
There was an active shooter somewhere 
that was taken out by a,

577
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,470
a good guy,
a gun on her.

578
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,390
It can happen.
You're right.

579
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:29,840
It doesn't happen everywhere all the 
time.

580
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,063
But it can happen in a lot of people get
their guns stolen or taken away because 

581
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,440
in that moment they can't use it.
Sure.

582
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,220
And the criminal,
he ain't got nothing to lose.

583
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:42,230
He's already a criminal.
You know what I mean?

584
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,360
It's also probably used to violence.
Yeah.

585
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,980
A lot of people are not used to 
violence.

586
00:25:45,981 --> 00:25:46,814
There's a lot of soft people out there 
that they don't know what to do if the 

587
00:25:48,831 --> 00:25:50,810
shit hits the fan in any way,
shape or form,

588
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,610
they just don't know how to handle 
pressure.

589
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,271
Yeah.
And,

590
00:25:53,271 --> 00:25:54,800
and it's,
you know,

591
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:58,700
that happens in the neck.
So they buy a gun to protect themselves,

592
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,980
but they're in no way equipped to use 
it.

593
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:01,940
Yeah.
Yeah.

594
00:26:01,941 --> 00:26:02,774
Well there's a lot of that.
They're hoping that they can use it or 

595
00:26:04,281 --> 00:26:06,110
to scare people off or something like 
that,

596
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:07,490
but most likely,
yeah,

597
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,920
they're not going to be able to do it,
but you know,

598
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,300
then there's people that say,
well,

599
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:14,570
that's them.
I want the option because I will be able

600
00:26:14,571 --> 00:26:15,550
to figure it out,
you know,

601
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,483
because I'm not a pussy or I'm not.
Then there's a legal way to get one 

602
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,573
thing,
you know,

603
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,730
you do what it takes to and you register
it.

604
00:26:22,731 --> 00:26:24,710
And again,
most gun owners that I know,

605
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,190
and I may be wrong because it's not like
I'm deep in the gun culture,

606
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:31,160
so I'm not speaking with that expertise.
I'm just talking about,

607
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:35,180
of the people I know who have guns,
who are into guns and shooting.

608
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,560
I only have one friend who's like,
doesn't want to register his guns or,

609
00:26:39,561 --> 00:26:40,394
or anything like that.
Most of them I know they're fine with 

610
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,230
their gun residue.
One

611
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,480
friend's argument,
uh,

612
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:49,860
I couldn't even tell you.
I honestly couldn't say I love him.

613
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:53,580
I love him when it comes to guns.
He's got a little,

614
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,160
he's got some of that paranoia.
He's got some of that,

615
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:59,260
the government government or no,
and then you know,

616
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:03,630
his thing with we were talking about,
and I know it's the wrong term,

617
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:06,690
but it's the common term assault 
weapons,

618
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,010
assault type weapons.
Right?

619
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,880
And he said like,
yeah,

620
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,220
well what if there's a home invasion?
That's what they use.

621
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,063
And I was like,
ain't nobody invading your broke ass 

622
00:27:15,181 --> 00:27:17,620
home.
You ain't going to want to get your,

623
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,140
you know what I mean?
You got you.

624
00:27:19,141 --> 00:27:22,820
Got You an average American with a two 
bedroom in the suburbs.

625
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,500
Ain't nobody invading your shit.
You ain't got a safe.

626
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,750
If you were selling crack,
you might want to worry.

627
00:27:27,751 --> 00:27:29,280
You might have some cash around the 
house.

628
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,570
Even if you were a good marijuana 
distributor,

629
00:27:31,571 --> 00:27:33,810
there'd be a bunch of cash.
You're not allowed to put in the bank,

630
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,210
but you ain't nobody invading your 
house.

631
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,570
Yeah.
Everybody wants to be John Wick.

632
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

633
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,093
Fucking take out a whole crew of people 
breaking into your house flooded and 

634
00:27:45,091 --> 00:27:46,890
people over staircases.
John Wick's,

635
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:48,330
bad ass.
I love John.

636
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:54,150
I ain't got a lot of fun.
I love John Wayne my all time favorite.

637
00:27:54,151 --> 00:27:56,490
Nobody's sitting around talking about 
John Wick.

638
00:27:56,491 --> 00:27:58,860
When you meet John Wick,
your shit is over.

639
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,010
That's Kiana reeves.
Best role.

640
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,960
Oh Man.
That's the matrix.

641
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,063
That scene when the.
When the gangster calls John Leguizamo 

642
00:28:08,341 --> 00:28:10,200
and it's like,
did you hit my son?

643
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,663
Yeah.
Why he stole John Wick's car and killed 

644
00:28:14,311 --> 00:28:16,110
his dog.
Thank you.

645
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,400
Yeah,
that's a great movie.

646
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,360
Both of them are great.
I enjoyed the second one too.

647
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,420
Silly.
Preposterous,

648
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,370
unrealistic but awesome.
Right?

649
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,323
I mean if you're,
if you like that sort of John Woo type 

650
00:28:29,671 --> 00:28:30,800
violence.
Yeah,

651
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,960
just off the charts.
Ridiculous gun violence.

652
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,310
But it's cartoonish and comic book.
Right.

653
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,810
It's not real.
And Kiano plays it,

654
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:40,561
you know,
he,

655
00:28:40,561 --> 00:28:42,810
he's so good at it.
Like he plays it perfectly,

656
00:28:42,811 --> 00:28:45,270
but just like,
just like any other movie,

657
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,150
the bad guys can't shoot.
Right.

658
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:51,090
Right.
So there's 25 guys shooting at him.

659
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,470
One of them might wing him when grades 
his shoulder.

660
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,570
It was getting shot in the shoulder a 
little bit.

661
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,030
Yeah.
I don't know.

662
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:03,270
I don't know what the argument is for 
not registering guns.

663
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,133
That makes sense because I mean unless 
you just want a world where everybody 

664
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:07,783
just pack and like there's like a few 
states where you have a concealed and 

665
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,653
open carry that you're just allowed to 
allowed to have a gun on your hip and 

666
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:20,760
just walk everywhere or they have the 
test but it's like I'm like,

667
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:21,594
it used to be here with traffic school 
where you just pay the guy and he gives 

668
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:25,674
you the certificate that you went or 
like they do these tests for carrying 

669
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,970
concealed,
but it's like you can do it online,

670
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,310
you know it.

671
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,040
It's crazy.
So it's,

672
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,253
well you're getting dudes in Texas,
you can do your hunting safety 

673
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,220
certificate online.
A couple of places

674
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,053
where you can get most places you have 
to go and for $100 safety certificate 

675
00:29:46,091 --> 00:29:50,440
you have to sit down through a,
I think it's eight hours of class and go

676
00:29:50,441 --> 00:29:51,274
through all this stuff.
Then you have to take a test and you 

677
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:53,910
have to understand things.
Yep.

678
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:57,400
Does it transfer from one state to the 
other leg?

679
00:29:57,401 --> 00:29:58,234
In other words,
your,

680
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,490
your license to hunt and Texas.
That's good.

681
00:30:00,491 --> 00:30:01,840
For some other states,

682
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:02,783
yeah,
if you have 100 safety certificate in 

683
00:30:03,631 --> 00:30:04,464
Texas,
it's.

684
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:08,700
It's good I think in almost every state,
but I mean that's.

685
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,680
That's a good thing.
It's a good thing to be,

686
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,400
to have to have some knowledge of what 
safety and it's about.

687
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,260
It's called a hunter safety thing.
It's not even about knowing how to hunt.

688
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,333
It's just about knowing how to not get 
shot or shoot yourself or shoot someone 

689
00:30:23,701 --> 00:30:28,440
else and how a gun works and how a all 
various weapons.

690
00:30:28,441 --> 00:30:30,240
Bows and arrows.
Crossbows and stuff work.

691
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,970
You don't have to do any of those.
Get a gun though.

692
00:30:32,971 --> 00:30:35,490
I mean if you just had to go through an 
eight hour course to get a gun,

693
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,443
how many less people would have guns?
She had a pass an eight hour course to 

694
00:30:38,881 --> 00:30:41,430
legally have a gun.
How many fewer people would have gotten?

695
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,980
It would probably be like 30 percent of 
the people that have guns now.

696
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,590
Well mean also,
you know,

697
00:30:45,591 --> 00:30:48,950
they're saying this is the wrong kind of
politicize it at which yeah,

698
00:30:48,951 --> 00:30:49,784
it is.
It's time for a politician to stand up 

699
00:30:51,381 --> 00:30:52,214
to the NRA.
It's not politicized because every 

700
00:30:54,441 --> 00:30:59,441
politician is afraid to say we need to 
register all the guns because the NRA is

701
00:30:59,661 --> 00:31:00,780
going to attack,
you know,

702
00:31:00,781 --> 00:31:03,320
they have their whole lobby machine,
but,

703
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:05,810
but it's going to take a politician who 
has the balls to say,

704
00:31:05,811 --> 00:31:06,411
Hey,
wait a minute,

705
00:31:06,411 --> 00:31:10,610
I can get as many people following me,
like in other words,

706
00:31:10,611 --> 00:31:11,444
challenge the NRA and get as many people
backing you as the NRA has the best way 

707
00:31:16,131 --> 00:31:18,320
to do it for these people to not say 
shit.

708
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:21,350
When they don't say shit,
then they don't get the tax.

709
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,610
What I'm saying,
they're afraid.

710
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,060
They're afraid right now to politicians 
who know better,

711
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:27,283
who absolutely know better,
who know that our current situation is 

712
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:34,310
ridiculous and our system is broken in,
in the gun laws.

713
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:37,220
None of them will stand up and say,
yeah,

714
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,310
now except the ones that the NRA already
hates.

715
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:43,010
Right?
Bernie Sanders type of characters,

716
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,070
right?
Yeah.

717
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,670
Yeah.

718
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,260
There's again,
it's the team thing,

719
00:31:46,261 --> 00:31:47,370
right?
Yeah.

720
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,080
Yeah.
You're supporting the left.

721
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:49,943
They're supporting the right.
Everybody meets in the middle and they 

722
00:31:51,271 --> 00:31:51,920
yell at each other.

723
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,610
Yeah,
and,

724
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,640
and this is a,
you know,

725
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,120
this is not a left,
right?

726
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:57,643
This is just a,
it's another one of those common sense 

727
00:31:59,241 --> 00:32:01,010
issues where we don't have common sense.
Like I,

728
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,113
I joke sometimes on state,
like I'm going to Canada next week I'm 

729
00:32:05,631 --> 00:32:08,360
doing a tour and I had had this joke 
like,

730
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:12,920
can you explain it to a Canadian like 
that should be to test for what sane can

731
00:32:12,921 --> 00:32:16,040
you explain it to a Canadian?
I was doing it regarding healthcare,

732
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:20,630
like try to explain to a Canadian why 
we've demonized healthcare,

733
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,840
why we want to shut that out.
And you do,

734
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:25,810
you can't even make meaning that 
they're,

735
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,673
they're anti obamacare.
So rather than look for a compromise or 

736
00:32:30,441 --> 00:32:31,274
fix the system,
just shut it down because it's called 

737
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,380
Obamacare,
right?

738
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,580
Like the,
just the anger at the name.

739
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:41,180
You lie like that famous night that 
Kimmel did where it was like,

740
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,990
are you against obamacare?

741
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:45,650
I hate obamacare.
What about the affordable care act?

742
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,513
Oh,
I like that.

743
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:47,390
It's the same thing.
Yeah,

744
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,223
exactly.
And he did a man on the street and 

745
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:51,470
that's what,
you know so many people were.

746
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,590
And that's what I mean by demonize,
you attached this name to it.

747
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,453
So people just are anti just based on 
that without looking at any rather than 

748
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,891
saying,
okay,

749
00:33:00,891 --> 00:33:01,724
like maybe this part like to no 
preexisting is part of the healthcare 

750
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:05,780
plan.
That's a good idea.

751
00:33:05,781 --> 00:33:06,614
So we're going to keep that.
But maybe the cost of this is a bad 

752
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:10,790
idea.
So we're gonna change that,

753
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:13,290
you know what I mean?
And working to fix it.

754
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,473
The gun issue is the same way.
There's certain freedoms that I 

755
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:18,350
understand and you,
you know,

756
00:33:18,351 --> 00:33:23,120
the right to bear arms and so on.
And again it was written in a completely

757
00:33:23,121 --> 00:33:24,860
different time,
you know,

758
00:33:24,861 --> 00:33:27,230
so we need to update that,
right?

759
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,440
Taking into account everything that we 
deal with today.

760
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,353
Well one step at a time.
If you're going to talk about the 

761
00:33:32,501 --> 00:33:33,334
affordable care act,
if you get to talk about healthcare at 

762
00:33:34,511 --> 00:33:35,740
all,
you're gonna have to talk about what are

763
00:33:35,741 --> 00:33:37,380
the real issues,
like what,

764
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,000
what are the root causes of diseases,
you know,

765
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:42,570
and a big part of the root causes 
diseases or how people eat and.

766
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,553
Oh yeah,
I mean if people eat poorly and they 

767
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,263
consume a lot of refined carbohydrates 
and a lot of processed sugars and they 

768
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,653
know their diet is filled with bullshit 
and they're drinking every day and 

769
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:54,240
they're smoking cigarettes.
Like,

770
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:55,503
man,
if you want to make those choices with 

771
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:59,380
your life,
you are going to get diseases.

772
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:02,470
There's just,
it's almost an extra right.

773
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:03,363
And you.
And then you start battling the 

774
00:34:04,481 --> 00:34:08,980
corporations and you know,
big food and stuff like that because you

775
00:34:08,981 --> 00:34:12,070
know,
why it's so much cheaper to poorly,

776
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,293
but just think,
well that's because it's cheaper to 

777
00:34:14,741 --> 00:34:16,960
produce.
But we think about the,

778
00:34:16,961 --> 00:34:17,371
uh,
the,

779
00:34:17,371 --> 00:34:21,400
the actual physical numbers of people 
that die every year from heart disease.

780
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,770
Oh absolutely.
It's fun

781
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,193
because,
you know,

782
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,590
look at the amount of,
of,

783
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,380
of fast food we consume.
Yeah.

784
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,800
And it's,
it's like fast food is an evil.

785
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:33,190
There's times when you know you're on 
the run and you want to grab a burger,

786
00:34:33,191 --> 00:34:34,140
you want to grab for it.

787
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,680
Good.
You're a whole dot okay.

788
00:34:36,681 --> 00:34:37,161
But.
Right.

789
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:40,520
But it can't be the only thing you eat 
all the time.

790
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,750
You saw supersize me,
right?

791
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,613
Yeah.
Yeah.

792
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,810
I mean it ain't good.
No,

793
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,620
it's not good to know.
Just constant bullshit.

794
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:48,643
Right?
Well you can't eat that much salt and 

795
00:34:50,031 --> 00:34:54,080
grease all the time and not have 
anything you do.

796
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,363
There's a penalty.

797
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,750
No Salsa but nxs.
Yeah,

798
00:34:58,751 --> 00:35:01,720
it's all bullshit.
That's that whole thing about salt being

799
00:35:01,721 --> 00:35:04,150
bad for you in salt,
raising high blood pressure and all that

800
00:35:04,151 --> 00:35:04,984
stuff that was kind of concocted by one 
doctor and ran with is really very 

801
00:35:08,381 --> 00:35:09,980
little evidence about that.
I don't know.

802
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,470
I'm black.
God told us not to eat,

803
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,200
so they tell you not to eat fatty foods 
either.

804
00:35:14,201 --> 00:35:16,780
But meanwhile it's refined carbohydrates
that are.

805
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:21,100
The real issue is sugar and everything 
is in sugar and we are addicted.

806
00:35:21,101 --> 00:35:22,870
We are shooting addicts,
sugar,

807
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,940
corn syrup.
I mean.

808
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:27,520
And then there's also all these studies 
that talked to you about red meat,

809
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:28,623
but when you look at the studies about 
red meat and you look at the criticisms 

810
00:35:30,221 --> 00:35:31,054
of studies,
like people that eat red meat get more 

811
00:35:32,111 --> 00:35:32,944
cancer will.
The real criticism of those studies is 

812
00:35:34,661 --> 00:35:38,220
what are you eating with the red meat?
Because are you eating like lean

813
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:42,180
like grass fed bison with like asparagus
and Broccoli?

814
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,820
I bet you're pretty fucking healthy if 
you're doing that.

815
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:45,803
The real issues are you eating burgers?
They don't differentiate between the 

816
00:35:48,511 --> 00:35:49,344
two.
When you talk about people that eat red 

817
00:35:50,521 --> 00:35:53,760
meat five times a week and the 
correlation between cancer,

818
00:35:53,761 --> 00:35:56,460
they're literally not even taking into 
consideration what they eat.

819
00:35:56,461 --> 00:36:00,780
What that red meat are they eating white
bread or the eating sugary soda?

820
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:01,823
This again Joe,
this is what we're talking about the 

821
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:04,074
same thing because it's like the common 
sense argument is eliminated because of 

822
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,360
common sense arguments.
Quiet.

823
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,583
So you have the loud yelling or if 
course of of you know the meat lobby 

824
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,140
versus whoever,
whoever's the anti meet people.

825
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,750
And so you know what I mean?
And the common sense is in between,

826
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:22,584
like you said,
there's healthy ways to eat meat or 

827
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:25,854
maybe you don't need it every with every
meal or not every day you mix it up or 

828
00:36:29,371 --> 00:36:30,870
stuff like that.
It's not meat,

829
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,793
but,
but needed something that human beings 

830
00:36:32,701 --> 00:36:36,420
at eating forever.
But ways to eat carbohydrates,

831
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,670
sugars,
say healthy ways to eat meat.

832
00:36:38,671 --> 00:36:39,750
I mean,
what you're saying,

833
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,690
what you eat around it,
how is it prepared?

834
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,250
Right.
And so on that,

835
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,163
that can make it,
that can be the difference between 

836
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:48,750
healthy and unhealthy.
You know,

837
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,670
chicken,
you know,

838
00:36:50,671 --> 00:36:53,400
is,
is supposed to be good for it.

839
00:36:53,401 --> 00:36:53,911
But,
but,

840
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:54,744
you know,
fried chicken deep fried chicken has 

841
00:36:56,971 --> 00:37:01,971
been sitting in the grease for x number 
of hours waiting for you to kind of pick

842
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:03,460
it up.
Flower,

843
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,410
right?
Exactly.

844
00:37:04,411 --> 00:37:05,610
It's not,
you know,

845
00:37:05,611 --> 00:37:08,190
that is not a healthy way to eat 
chicken.

846
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,930
Delicious.
Resize me to.

847
00:37:09,931 --> 00:37:12,210
You'll never look at chicken the same 
way he's doing this.

848
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,020
Take that down.
Don't ruin chicken for me.

849
00:37:15,021 --> 00:37:15,140
I have

850
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,320
an issue with him though.
He did a show where he was,

851
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:21,170
um,
he did like 30 days.

852
00:37:21,171 --> 00:37:23,390
Is that,
was that the name of his show and one of

853
00:37:23,391 --> 00:37:24,224
the things he did was on hormone 
replacement surgery or hormone 

854
00:37:26,301 --> 00:37:28,520
replacement,
like testosterone replacement and things

855
00:37:28,521 --> 00:37:29,354
along those lines,
but I know for a fact that the producer 

856
00:37:31,951 --> 00:37:35,270
has tried to go to legitimate doctors 
and the doctors turned them down because

857
00:37:35,271 --> 00:37:36,650
they said,
this is not how you do it.

858
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,630
You don't do anything like that over 30 
days.

859
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,270
Hold on a second.
So when he did for that show,

860
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,130
because he went to a quack,
quack,

861
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,050
shot him up a testosterone,
not him.

862
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,063
The guy on the show that he uses a study
case and they shot this guy up with 

863
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:50,684
testosterone.
When the guy started getting aggressive 

864
00:37:51,801 --> 00:37:53,510
and yelling at his kids and his wife was
like,

865
00:37:53,511 --> 00:37:55,060
I like you Chubby,
Chubby,

866
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,300
Chubby family.

867
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,133
I'm like,
this is the dumbest fucking example of 

868
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,600
the science behind manipulating your 
hormones,

869
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:05,300
like the way you're supposed to do at 
his first address,

870
00:38:05,301 --> 00:38:06,440
your diet.
Number one,

871
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,750
you take your diet into consideration 
like,

872
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:09,763
what are you eating?
Are you getting these gigantic insulin 

873
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:13,424
spikes all day?
Like your hormone levels are completely 

874
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:18,290
dependent upon what kind of food you 
consume,

875
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:21,110
so what they would do in a,
in a healthy doctor,

876
00:38:21,111 --> 00:38:23,840
the doctor that I was using this don't 
say his name,

877
00:38:23,841 --> 00:38:24,674
but he was.
What he would do is for like the first 

878
00:38:27,111 --> 00:38:27,944
couple months,
the first thing you would do is change 

879
00:38:29,991 --> 00:38:30,824
your diet.
The first thing you would do is don't 

880
00:38:32,571 --> 00:38:35,800
eat late at night.
The first thing you would do eat healthy

881
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:36,190
food

882
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:41,190
and they would literally check your,
your blood nutrition levels and say,

883
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:41,861
well,
you are.

884
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:45,280
You're low on Niacin.
You're low on vitamin D,

885
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:48,070
you're low in vitamin B.
You got to add these to your diet.

886
00:38:48,071 --> 00:38:49,390
Let's see what your hormone levels are 
like.

887
00:38:49,391 --> 00:38:50,111
Then,
oh look,

888
00:38:50,111 --> 00:38:53,230
we have this big spike now we have a 
healthy baseline.

889
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,270
Now we've done this for four or five 
months.

890
00:38:55,271 --> 00:38:58,810
Now we know where you're at and what you
need in this.

891
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,030
They didn't do that.
They just shot him up with some shit.

892
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,610
So that guy in his show,
I,

893
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:05,860
I had problems with them ever since and 
I'm like,

894
00:39:05,861 --> 00:39:08,740
why would you like that sensationalism?
That's bullshit.

895
00:39:08,741 --> 00:39:09,574
Like what you've done is you put 
together a show where you've had a 

896
00:39:11,621 --> 00:39:14,270
terrible representation of something 
that uh,

897
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:16,810
millions of people engage in hormone 
replacement.

898
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,670
Well,
even in supersize me,

899
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,940
even if you ate at Mcdonald's,
you wouldn't eat as much as he did.

900
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,090
Right?
You wouldn't supersize every meal.

901
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,590
And that was the deal though.
He said if they offered him supersize he

902
00:39:29,591 --> 00:39:33,800
was going to say they always do.
They always offered up upsides.

903
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,860
You.
Yeah.

904
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:39,550
But then I've heard people also say 
they've done the same thing they've done

905
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:40,384
that supersize me diet and try it for 30
days and they didn't have nearly the 

906
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:43,683
negative responses and they thought that
that they might've sensationalize that 

907
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:47,740
as well.
They probably did.

908
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,140
I mean it's TV.
Right?

909
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:52,150
But in that case,
and yeah,

910
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,380
and it's also,
you know,

911
00:39:53,381 --> 00:39:55,330
you talk about hormones and things like 
that,

912
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:59,560
different people react to things 
different ways.

913
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:00,530
Sure.
You know,

914
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,840
their,
their bodies,

915
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,300
some people's.
But,

916
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,061
and,
and you know,

917
00:40:04,061 --> 00:40:05,170
it drives you crazy,
right?

918
00:40:05,171 --> 00:40:06,001
That person,
you know,

919
00:40:06,001 --> 00:40:06,834
that each junk food all the time,
but it has this crazy metabolism and 

920
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:10,690
they never gained weight.

921
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:14,710
Twinkie Diet helps nutrition professor 
lose 27 pounds.

922
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:15,544
Then.
There you go.

923
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,910
Yeah,
let's pull.

924
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:19,750
Pull this up here just to prove the 
calories in,

925
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,750
calories out thing.
But there's a caveat in this to this.

926
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,580
It doesn't have any,
uh,

927
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,070
hold on hormone stuff.
Go down.

928
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,740
Let me see it from the top.
Uh,

929
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,950
for 10 weeks,
mark,

930
00:40:29,951 --> 00:40:34,930
how professor of nutrition at Kansas 
State University ate one of these sugary

931
00:40:34,931 --> 00:40:35,764
cake,
gets every three hours instead of meals 

932
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:40,810
to add variety to his steady stream of 
hostess and Little Debbie snacks.

933
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:45,820
How munched on Doritos chips,
sugary cereal and Oreos,

934
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,700
Oreos to his premise that in weight 
loss,

935
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,770
pure calorie counting is what matters 
most,

936
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,350
not the nutritional value of the food.
Uh,

937
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:56,140
the premise held up a on this 
convenience store die.

938
00:40:56,141 --> 00:40:58,390
He shed 27 pounds in two months.
But here's the thing,

939
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,020
what does his body fat like?
What's his body composition?

940
00:41:02,021 --> 00:41:03,400
Stop,
go back.

941
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:07,540
See,
like he's shed 27 pounds in two months.

942
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,463
That doesn't mean anything.
Like if you lost all of your muscle and 

943
00:41:11,891 --> 00:41:14,740
gain fat and you lost,
I mean,

944
00:41:14,741 --> 00:41:17,410
you got to understand like if you're not
taking in any protein,

945
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,810
your body's not gonna.
Be able to maintain muscle mass.

946
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,673
Now,
if your body's not going to maintain 

947
00:41:21,431 --> 00:41:23,410
muscle mass,
you're going to have less.

948
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:27,310
See,
see his body fat mass index went from 28

949
00:41:27,311 --> 00:41:30,370
point eight,
considered overweight to 24 point nine,

950
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:33,700
which is normally not always 174 pounds.
Hmm?

951
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,880
His bad cholesterol.
Ldl drop 20 percent and is good.

952
00:41:37,881 --> 00:41:40,310
Cholesterol.
Hdl increased by 20 percent.

953
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,960
He reduced the level of triglycerides,
which are a form of fat by 39 percent.

954
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,880
That's where the head scratching comes 
from.

955
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:48,380
Hub says,
uh,

956
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,360
what does that mean?
Does it mean I'm healthier?

957
00:41:50,361 --> 00:41:53,510
Does it mean how we define health from a
biological standpoint that we're missing

958
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,760
something?
Just temporary success.

959
00:41:55,761 --> 00:41:56,594
He does not remember.

960
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,960
Look,
take rebellion.

961
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:00,770
Yeah.

962
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,210
He also,
oh,

963
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:03,044
wait a minute.
He also took a multivitamin pill and 

964
00:42:04,551 --> 00:42:05,384
drink a protein shake daily and the ate 
vegetables typically a can of can of 

965
00:42:10,431 --> 00:42:12,470
green beans or three or four celery 
stalks.

966
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,120
All right,
well that's,

967
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,590
that's a stupid study.

968
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:19,680
He's replacing something.
Nutrients,

969
00:42:19,681 --> 00:42:20,750
vitamins.
Yeah.

970
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:23,910
So he's not living on twinkies and yeah,
that's bullshit.

971
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,860
And uh,
the retos yeah,

972
00:42:25,861 --> 00:42:30,730
if you just did that without the,
without the protein and what the vine,

973
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,320
it would've been a different result.
But people love.

974
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,490
I mean,
that's why we're reading it.

975
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,370
We're reading it because he got a 
sensational results.

976
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,320
And,
and the way it was written,

977
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:43,830
this sensational part.
What's the first part of the article?

978
00:42:43,831 --> 00:42:44,664
Of course.
And you had to go way down before you 

979
00:42:45,901 --> 00:42:49,480
got to the part about eating vegetables 
and drinking a protein shake.

980
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:52,770
Yeah.
Don't eat little debbie cakes all day.

981
00:42:52,771 --> 00:42:54,570
Folks.
Don't do that.

982
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,970
You'll get fucked up if you've learned 
anything today.

983
00:42:56,971 --> 00:42:57,804
You cannot live on twinkies,
but every now and then have a fucking 

984
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,860
twinkie.
You know,

985
00:43:01,861 --> 00:43:04,860
I believe everything in moderation,
including moderation.

986
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,840
That's what I believe.
I think that's an Oscar wilde quote.

987
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:09,420
I think it's a great quote because I 
think that's good.

988
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:14,480
I mean even just have some bullshit 
every now and then have a big Mac,

989
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,390
you know that people have the cheat day 
or whatever.

990
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:21,090
And yeah,
and you gotta it's because you're human,

991
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:24,360
you're human and you're going to have it
and some of it's delicious.

992
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,673
It's fun.
It's fun to eat a waffle smothered in 

993
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,590
maple syrup.
It's fun.

994
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:31,603
It's fun.
Every now and then to go to fucking 

995
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:34,500
waffle house.
You go to waffle house on the road.

996
00:43:34,501 --> 00:43:37,700
Of course I've worked with south your 
waffle house.

997
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:40,440
We have the ability to waffle house when
they were on both sides of the freeway.

998
00:43:40,441 --> 00:43:43,590
So no matter which ramp you come off,
you don't have to turn.

999
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:48,750
The South has waffle houses.
It's like the West has in and out.

1000
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:51,120
The South has waffle house,
you know,

1001
00:43:51,121 --> 00:43:51,954
they,
they put it in and out in Dallas and he 

1002
00:43:52,891 --> 00:43:55,620
had lines around the block days for 
days.

1003
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:58,040
People like people had never seen a 
fucking cheeseburger before.

1004
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,040
And you know,
who was mad?

1005
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:01,140

everyone's lining up for that California
Liberal Burger.

1009
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:10,351
Yeah.
Well,

1010
00:44:10,351 --> 00:44:11,184
if you're the unknown comic and you're 
playing at a club and Chris rock is at 

1011
00:44:13,831 --> 00:44:15,960
the fucking arena next door,
you can't get pissed off.

1012
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:18,090
Someone's got a better product than you.
Let me,

1013
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:20,550
let me speak from experience to that.
Joe,

1014
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,700
let me speak from experience.
I was booked at,

1015
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,550
what's it called?
The club 29 or whatever.

1016
00:44:26,551 --> 00:44:28,710
That casino.
Just past palm springs.

1017
00:44:28,711 --> 00:44:30,010
I don't know if you grew up.
Worked out there,

1018
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,433
but anyway,
one of those big Indian casinos and and 

1019
00:44:33,601 --> 00:44:34,434
I had never worked this place before,
so I'm booked to work the comedy club 

1020
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:38,454
inside.

1021
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,760
Guess who's working the arena behind the
Kotel.

1022

00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:46,650

show.

1025
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,333

Like really your ideas to put me in 

1026
00:44:51,931 --> 00:44:54,960

You couldn't think of some other comic.

1027
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,110
When was this was?
It was about four years ago,

1028
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,330

00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:08,630
I want to go to the Chris rock show 
though.

1032
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:09,750
People at my show.

1033
00:45:09,751 --> 00:45:10,584

Why don't we all just go out and watch

00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,470
Water burgers.
Okay.

00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,013
Then I'm shaking,
but their burgers are God damn good 

1048
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,310
burgers.
Good fries are good.

1049
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,810
Fries.
Potatoes.

1050
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:56,220
He had.
The potatoes are better.

1051
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,280
Yeah.
It seemed to have a better idea of what?

1052
00:45:58,281 --> 00:46:00,720
A fries.
And then they have Cajun fries.

1053
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,040
Yeah,
yeah,

1054
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:02,610
yeah.
No,

1055
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:03,740
I'm dumb.
But I guess.

1056
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:08,140
Well that's why they're in the game.
What about a steak and shake?

1057
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,960
What do you think of that can suck my 
dick.

1058
00:46:09,961 --> 00:46:11,910
I said it right here.
Peanuts,

1059
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:16,590
peanuts,
baphy that hungry.

1060
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:17,993
Hungry.
It's nothing wrong with peanuts unless 

1061
00:46:18,571 --> 00:46:19,830
you've got a peanut allergy,
of course.

1062
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:21,443
Which is another thing we're talking 
about how different people react to 

1063
00:46:22,921 --> 00:46:23,754
different things.
The peanut allergy is always like the 

1064
00:46:25,051 --> 00:46:27,090
best argument.
This is the new thing,

1065
00:46:27,091 --> 00:46:27,924
and I've only heard this recently,
actually this year is the first time I 

1066
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:31,354
heard it where they're like,
you can't have anything peanut related 

1067
00:46:34,321 --> 00:46:37,650
on an airplane because a passenger has a
severe peanut allergy.

1068
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,040
Yeah.
Well something.

1069
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:41,730
I hadn't heard that until this year.
I've heard it.

1070
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:42,743
When you crack open a peanut,
you know that dust to kind of goes in 

1071
00:46:45,181 --> 00:46:46,920
the air.
That shit kills people.

1072
00:46:46,921 --> 00:46:48,600
Wow.
Which is nuts.

1073
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,980
Yeah.
Imagine if you didn't,

1074
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:50,853
you didn't like somebody you got right 
up to him and just see a shit cracking 

1075
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,640
in their face.
That would be some CSI shit.

1076
00:46:56,641 --> 00:46:59,040
Like they'd have to figure out how you 
killed him.

1077
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,170
Who opened the peanut?
Yeah.

1078
00:47:01,171 --> 00:47:02,004
You know,
I was thinking this is a terrible 

1079
00:47:02,701 --> 00:47:04,500
thought,
but I was thinking this about Tom Petty.

1080
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:07,440
I was like a wonder if Tom Petty,
you heard the news about Vegas and had a

1081
00:47:07,441 --> 00:47:10,440
fucking heart attack.
Can you imagine if that got killed?

1082
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,960
Tom Petty from a distance could happen.
Is that.

1083
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:13,853
How did Tom Petty had a heart attack?
Did he know about what time was his 

1084
00:47:16,951 --> 00:47:20,610
heart attack?
Was it Sunday night or was it Sunday Day

1085
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,370
then?
How old was he?

1086
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,540
Sixty six,
man.

1087
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:26,480
That ain't real.
Yeah,

1088
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:27,413
66.
The loans still fucking kicking ass and 

1089
00:47:28,831 --> 00:47:32,950
action movies still is.
I think Liam.

1090
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:38,430
Liam Neeson was taken the second time.
I'm just thinking if I'm a thug,

1091
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:43,990
I can't let a 70 year old whip my ass.
You know what I'm saying?

1092
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,450
There's a certain age where it's like,
no man,

1093
00:47:46,451 --> 00:47:48,970
you.
I don't care how long you been fighting.

1094
00:47:48,971 --> 00:47:52,630
What training you had listened old man.
I'm in my thug prime,

1095
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,673
who's like the oldest guy who 
legitimately make sense as like a stone 

1096
00:47:57,131 --> 00:48:02,131
cold killer and a movie was at Bronson,
but Charles Bronson deathwish,

1097
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:02,910
he was already here.

1098
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:03,743
We're already like fat Charles Bronson.
He got like the Chubby face and you 

1099
00:48:06,761 --> 00:48:11,170
couldn't take his suit off.
Whereas like he go back to like the hard

1100
00:48:11,171 --> 00:48:12,760
times Bronson,
he was 50,

1101
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,220
he was going to shred,
shredded.

1102
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:16,793
I'm just,
I'm trying to think as anyone in their 

1103
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:22,420
sixties legitimate to whip your ass.
Like physically not,

1104
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:25,320
not shoot you,
but George Foreman.

1105
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:27,010
Fuck you up.
Yeah.

1106
00:48:27,011 --> 00:48:28,270
Well he's,
he's a puncher.

1107
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:29,243
Yeah.
George Foreman's probably 60 years old 

1108
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,540
that he'll fight Stevens.
What did he call it?

1109
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:35,610
Steven Seagal.
Oh,

1110
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,000
George Foreman.
What?

1111
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:38,910
Get the fuck Outta here.
Oh,

1112
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,050
after craziness.
What is,

1113
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,710
what was the golf talking crazy.
You can do anything you want 10 rounds,

1114
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:45,603
something like that.

1115
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,300
That is so ridiculously stupid if Steven
Seagal,

1116
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:50,163
because all you'd have to do is pour 
water on his head and that black shit 

1117
00:48:52,181 --> 00:48:53,014
would just run down into his eyes and 
wouldn't be able to say what does it 

1118
00:48:55,301 --> 00:48:56,134
say?
George Foreman just challenged Steven 

1119
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,640
Seagal to a no holds barred fight.
Boy,

1120
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:04,510
that would be a God damn disaster.
Sixty eight year old boxing legend.

1121
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:07,240
Use twitter to challenge 65 year old 
action movies,

1122
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:12,260
but I've got a $68.
I bet every

1123
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:15,690
fucking eight year old former in versus 
65 year olds to go

1124
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:19,090
of challenge you one on one.
I use boxing.

1125
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:21,410
You can use whatever,
10 rounds in Vegas.

1126
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:26,330
No weapons hand to handling.
That will be a fucking disaster.

1127
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,433
First of all,
George Foreman is so big that he had 

1128
00:49:29,661 --> 00:49:34,661
this shall defense that he adopted later
in his career where he would curl up.

1129
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,350
Right,
and he was so big.

1130
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:39,190
There was so much arm there.
You couldn't hit anything.

1131
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:41,360
You hit his stomach.
Could luck with all that.

1132
00:49:41,361 --> 00:49:42,590
You're not going to hurt them to the 
body.

1133
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:47,060
And then he's got these hands that are 
literally like canned hams and he just.

1134
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:49,970
He would just jab people into a coma.

1135
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,313
Should a guy,
I think he's playing for the Milwaukee 

1136
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,990
Bucks.
His hands around the basketball.

1137
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:59,090
Could you see that?
He literally his.

1138
00:49:59,160 --> 00:49:59,993
It's like a soft ball in his hands.
The people that are getting bigger and 

1139
00:50:03,221 --> 00:50:04,054
bigger and bigger and bigger.
I mean go back to like Jack Johnson who 

1140
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,730
was a giant when he won the heavyweight 
championship.

1141
00:50:09,731 --> 00:50:12,760
It's only sex too.
It was not wanting to go to a big guy,

1142
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:13,990
you know,
my,

1143
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:17,170
my,
a big hand moment earlier this year.

1144
00:50:17,171 --> 00:50:20,820
I did a show and Oh,
look at that guy's hands that show.

1145
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:21,783
Show them around the basketball.
If you have that picture that looks 

1146
00:50:23,471 --> 00:50:24,304
cartoonish,
that doesn't even look real good that 

1147
00:50:27,511 --> 00:50:30,050
that guy must have a dick.
Like a palm tree.

1148
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,600
Jesus Christ.
Holy Shit.

1149
00:50:32,601 --> 00:50:35,330
It's two feet from his middle finger to 
the base of his hand.

1150
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,000
That's insane.
Is that?

1151
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:38,840
Yes.
Yes.

1152
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:44,120
Centimeters.
Centimeters in my.

1153
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:46,560
Less with the centimeters.
Communist.

1154
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,670
Same size as Jerry Rice's.
So yeah,

1155
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:50,930
that makes sense.
So I got back.

1156
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:52,850
There it is.
Look at that.

1157
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:54,003
Well,
how old was he then in high school then 

1158
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:58,550
it looks like Jesus Christ.
Wow.

1159
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,150
They call them the Greek freak.
Yeah,

1160
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,320
the Greek freak.
He's amazing because he Greek.

1161
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:05,670
I can't relate to the coop.
Whoa,

1162
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:06,740
whoa.
What's the name?

1163
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:08,260
Oh,
it needs a hell of a ball player.

1164
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:16,140
Tick.
How do you say that?

1165
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,840
Onto Kupo.
Onto tongue tip.

1166
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:24,030
Toe to toe.
Cone onto.

1167
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:26,450
To come.
So he's from Greece.

1168
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:27,780
Yeah.
Yeah.

1169
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:29,360
Interesting.
Yeah.

1170
00:51:29,361 --> 00:51:32,840
I mean like what if that guy gets a hold
of like a Gabrielle Reece,

1171
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:33,950
she's already married,
but you know,

1172
00:51:33,951 --> 00:51:34,784
something along those lines.
A large woman like the woman from game 

1173
00:51:38,031 --> 00:51:40,880
of thrones,
but that picture a hold of her,

1174
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:46,010
shoot some super sperm in there,
make some giant data.

1175
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,940
Next generation's going to be a hell of 
a lot with animals for sport.

1176
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:50,774
What sport would that kid go into?
Any party wants fucking sporty once 

1177
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:55,670
everybody get out of the way.
What about Aaron?

1178
00:51:55,671 --> 00:51:58,490
Judge six,
seven to 80 playing baseball.

1179
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:02,000
You see how that looks in his hand?
The Bat looks like a little twig,

1180
00:52:02,001 --> 00:52:04,820
like he's swinging a kid's back.
What are you seeing that though?

1181
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:05,930
That's one thing that's interesting.

1182
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:09,800
Like that guy in the past might've gone 
into football,

1183
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,200
but now guys we're looking at football.
I'm like,

1184
00:52:12,201 --> 00:52:14,000
fuck that.
I don't blame them.

1185
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,150
I don't blame.
There's guys that are retiring at 24,

1186
00:52:17,151 --> 00:52:17,984
25 years old.
Why am I going to have a three year 

1187
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:20,804
career with possible concussion damage 
and everything is possible when I could 

1188
00:52:23,961 --> 00:52:28,961
play baseball or basketball for 10 years
and and leave with $100,

1189
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:31,760
million dollars and just fuck everything
that moves.

1190
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:32,663
Yeah.
They did a study on former basketball 

1191
00:52:34,581 --> 00:52:38,600
players or former football players were 
either in a hundred 11 players.

1192
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:41,060
One hundred and 10 of them had cte 
cheese.

1193
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:43,580
Hundred and 10 out of 111.
Yeah.

1194
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,300
There's the guy who was the doctor 
behind that movie concussion.

1195
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:50,690
He was recently talking about Oj Simpson
because Oj Simpson was released and he's

1196
00:52:50,691 --> 00:52:51,524
like,
there's 100 percent chance that guy has 

1197
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:57,570
cte and they've even said that Oj,
if the trial was today,

1198
00:52:57,921 --> 00:53:01,840
his doctor said that he would introduce 
cte as a defense offense,

1199
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,013
which is crazy because then you have to 
say he's guilty because the defect is 

1200
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:07,340
always.
I didn't do it,

1201
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:10,070
you know,
until he wrote a book how I did it.

1202
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:11,300
Yeah.
If I did it,

1203
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:12,590
that was the book.
I know,

1204
00:53:12,591 --> 00:53:16,130
but if it's in tiny little red one and I
did it.

1205
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:20,480
I watched the Cuba gooding show last 
night to fx show.

1206
00:53:20,481 --> 00:53:21,314
I'd never seen.
You'd never seen people versus Oj 

1207
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:23,360
Simpson.
Great.

1208
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,800
It was a great record.
You great show.

1209
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,040
You know.
It's weird to watch man to,

1210
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:29,580
to revisit everything.
Cool.

1211
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,520
The night when the Oj got out,
it's like,

1212
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:33,990
just go away.
Yeah,

1213
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:37,430
just go quiet.
Don't say anything.

1214
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:40,860
Play Golf and keep your mouth shut.
He doesn't do this.

1215
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,480
He's not going to.
And he can't.

1216
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,550
He's a.
he's addicted to love.

1217
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,940
He's addicted to people liking them and 
there's going to always,

1218
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:48,953
if he goes to Florida,
there's plenty of fucking stupid people 

1219
00:53:50,731 --> 00:53:52,070
in.
It's going to take them right there.

1220
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:53,880
Easy.
Or He's going back to jail.

1221
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:54,743
He's gonna.
Do something stupid and violate his 

1222
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:57,624
parole.
Do you think you'll do that though at 

1223
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:00,390
seven years old or whatever he is?
Well,

1224
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,313
if he does anything other than shut up,
he's either going to die or go back to 

1225
00:54:04,861 --> 00:54:06,120
jail.
You know what I mean?

1226
00:54:06,121 --> 00:54:10,020
Like there's no,
there's no positive that's going to come

1227
00:54:10,021 --> 00:54:12,960
out of him making public appearances.

1228
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,880
You know,
writing a book,

1229
00:54:14,881 --> 00:54:16,770
going on the talk show circuit,
like no,

1230
00:54:16,771 --> 00:54:21,120
like you're 70 years old,
live out the last 10,

1231
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,680
15,
20 years,

1232
00:54:22,681 --> 00:54:24,470
whatever you got just lifted.
There's.

1233
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:26,250
And there's money somewhere,
right?

1234
00:54:26,251 --> 00:54:28,140
Because Florida,
they couldn't take his money,

1235
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:31,170
like moved there.
So he's gotten money somewhere.

1236
00:54:31,171 --> 00:54:34,380
Just just quietly fade away.
You know,

1237
00:54:34,381 --> 00:54:35,214
like people,
people might recognize you when you go 

1238
00:54:36,841 --> 00:54:41,841
down to play Bingo at the home.
Just wave bank some oprah in the,

1239
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:43,530
you know.
But,

1240
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,300
but yeah,
there's no,

1241
00:54:45,301 --> 00:54:49,290
I don't think there's any way.
There's no positive public appearance.

1242
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:51,210
No.
That Oj could make.

1243
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,133
No.

1244
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:53,003
The attorney general,
I think it was Florida was saying that 

1245
00:54:55,171 --> 00:54:57,690
she didn't want him hopping around her 
state playing,

1246
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:58,770
you know,
playing golf,

1247
00:54:58,771 --> 00:54:59,604
which is,
by the way

1248
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:01,640
state honey,
just let you know,

1249
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:05,780
you know,
it's fucking in the sense that she's the

1250
00:55:05,781 --> 00:55:09,290
top cop and she can prosecute him for 
any made up shit she wants

1251
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,370
do that.
That's not America.

1252
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,340
See when someone gets a fucking release,
right,

1253
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:15,930
you're released,
you're on parole,

1254
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:16,823
you're released from prison.
You can't just target someone because 

1255
00:55:19,261 --> 00:55:21,270
they're famous and they had been 
released through you.

1256
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:24,690
You're dealing with a million fucking 
murderers are getting out every day.

1257
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:26,370
You're dealing with.
I'm not a million obviously,

1258
00:55:26,371 --> 00:55:27,204
but you're dealing with a shit ton of 
people that were armed robbers and have 

1259
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:31,730
committed assault and rape.
They're getting out.

1260
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:32,791
Huh?
But again,

1261
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:33,810
Joe,
you're talking about,

1262
00:55:33,811 --> 00:55:37,890
and we were talking about this earlier,
theoretical versus reality in theory,

1263
00:55:37,891 --> 00:55:41,370
this is the United States of America and
you have freedoms and they can't do that

1264
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:43,560
to you in reality.
Hell yeah.

1265
00:55:43,561 --> 00:55:46,050
They can do it because it's like if they
follow you around,

1266
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:49,380
right?
If a cop followed you all day every day,

1267
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,080
you would break the law,
do you think so you.

1268
00:55:52,081 --> 00:55:53,370
Yeah.
You don't know how.

1269
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:56,850
You know it might be Jaywalking,
it might be speeding,

1270
00:55:56,851 --> 00:55:59,340
it might be whatever.
You know what I mean?

1271
00:55:59,341 --> 00:56:00,174
But you would do something that would 
violate some statute that you didn't 

1272
00:56:03,871 --> 00:56:05,850
know about you.
What you might be.

1273
00:56:05,851 --> 00:56:07,320
Well maybe you,
you know,

1274
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,333
I got that whole driving while black 
thing going for me when y'all saw crazy 

1275
00:56:10,651 --> 00:56:11,880
motorcycle rider.
That's true.

1276
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,170
I got that.
I need to ask you,

1277
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:16,680
as we brought this up the last time,
who was it on the podcast?

1278
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,910
We were talking about a bike that you 
had.

1279
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:21,100
It was with Burton.
Remember the bike that you have,

1280
00:56:21,101 --> 00:56:26,101
but you had some crazy giant wide 
Japanese super bike or a cruiser?

1281
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,340
It's trial.
It's called the triumph rocket three.

1282
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:32,500
Is that a trial?
That's what I'm talking about.

1283
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:35,490
It's a two point three liter motorcycle,
but it's.

1284
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:36,873
It's the engine is,
is bigger than a lot of car engines and 

1285
00:56:39,921 --> 00:56:42,600
the bike itself,
the bike is the bike itself,

1286
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:45,170
but this isn't talking about.
No,

1287
00:56:45,171 --> 00:56:45,440
no,
no.

1288
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,020
It was from a long time ago,
man.

1289
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,520
It's from like 10 years ago.
You had,

1290
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:52,540
you had this crazy wide bike that was a 
Japanese bike.

1291
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:54,840
Maybe it was a Suzuki Hio Bussa.
No,

1292
00:56:54,841 --> 00:56:55,674
no,
no.

1293
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:57,013
It wasn't one of those like rice rocket 
bikes wasn't my Ducati I had accustomed 

1294
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:02,410
to.
No,

1295
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:05,920
it was a Japanese Japanese,
but it was a big ass cruiser.

1296
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:07,270
It was one of those.
Oh,

1297
00:57:07,271 --> 00:57:08,890
I know what you're talking about.
You're talking about.

1298
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:13,060
It's called the valkyrie ruined run.
Oh yeah.

1299
00:57:13,061 --> 00:57:14,290
I remember that.
Yeah.

1300
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:15,940
Had that.
As a matter of fact,

1301
00:57:15,941 --> 00:57:18,090
that's what I had before the trial.
Right.

1302
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:20,920
I couldn't remember the name of that 
damn good recall Joe.

1303
00:57:20,921 --> 00:57:21,790
Yeah.
That bike was.

1304
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:25,820
That bike was one of a kind that looked 
like a spaceship.

1305
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,200
Like you were in that tron movie,
you know.

1306
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:29,970
There it is.
That's it.

1307
00:57:29,971 --> 00:57:30,804
No,
that's not it.

1308
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,651
No,
no.

1309
00:57:31,651 --> 00:57:35,560
That's the Valkyrie.
But look up argue and he ruined.

1310
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:37,253
Yeah.
So there's a different valcon we ruined 

1311
00:57:39,221 --> 00:57:40,650
with a custom version.
They said.

1312
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:42,011
Yeah,
it was a Honda.

1313
00:57:42,011 --> 00:57:45,240
I think that was it.
Yeah.

1314
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:47,350
You had,
you had that,

1315
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:49,840
had that,
that bike was bad.

1316
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:52,390
Know.
Bring it to the factors.

1317
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,760
Yeah.
I saw that thing and I was like,

1318
00:57:54,761 --> 00:57:58,960
what the fuck is part of why I got rid 
of that bike,

1319
00:57:58,961 --> 00:57:59,200
Joe?

1320
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,660
I'll be honest.
Polishing that thing.

1321
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:05,170
That thing had more chrome in more 
places.

1322
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,333
I'm telling you,
look at everything on that bike was 

1323
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:13,210
chromed engine,
the entire front end and I was like,

1324
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,030
man,
I can't spend all day cleaning.

1325
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,073
It was a great bike though.
It seems like a bike where if you 

1326
00:58:18,911 --> 00:58:19,744
accidentally laid it down,
it would take forever to get that thing 

1327
00:58:21,761 --> 00:58:26,761
back up to 800 pounds,
100 pounds for a beautiful,

1328
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:27,963
you know,
you know who bought a a group of those 

1329
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:30,453
who,
Clooney,

1330
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:31,810
George Clooney,
clooney,

1331
00:58:31,811 --> 00:58:33,190
but six of them.
Why?

1332
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:37,090
For him and his buddies for him and his 
buddies to variety bucks.

1333
00:58:37,091 --> 00:58:38,350
$6.
Damn is this,

1334
00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:40,060
you know,
I'm just like,

1335
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:41,373
you don't have fat ass like that.
Look how cool that paint job is on that 

1336
00:58:44,051 --> 00:58:44,980
thing.
He did that.

1337
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,130
That's custom paint that now do they 
still make that thing?

1338
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,930
No,
they only made it for a.

1339
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:52,390
They made it for one year.
It was like a limited.

1340
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:53,740
Yeah,
like a limited release.

1341
00:58:53,741 --> 00:58:56,380
They did it for one year.
He must have been stupid fast.

1342
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,910
It was pretty fast.
It was,

1343
00:58:57,911 --> 00:58:58,744
yeah.
It was pretty fast for Cruz who's very 

1344
00:59:00,131 --> 00:59:02,620
fast now.
Those comfortable to ride.

1345
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:03,483
It's not like the idea behind them.
It's comfortable because somebody 

1346
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:08,890
pushing you.
Right now I have an Indian chieftain.

1347
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,630
Right.
And this was my first,

1348
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:15,610
like American v twin kind of cruiser and
I've never been that guy.

1349
00:59:15,611 --> 00:59:16,121
Like,
you know,

1350
00:59:16,121 --> 00:59:18,660
I've never had a harley or anything,
but I saw this bike,

1351
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:22,100
the dealer and it was just absolutely 
beautiful.

1352
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:25,100
And I wrote it and,
and I guess I'm getting older.

1353
00:59:25,101 --> 00:59:25,934
There was some about leaning back with 
my feet forward and the stereo playing 

1354
00:59:29,290 --> 00:59:30,400
and I was like,
Oh yeah,

1355
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:32,390
yeah,
I like this shit.

1356
00:59:32,391 --> 00:59:33,224
Like I,
I remember leaning forward like being a 

1357
00:59:34,941 --> 00:59:37,490
jockey and going fast and now I'm like,
Nah,

1358
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:38,660
this is me.

1359
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,640
You like cruising now?
I like cruising.

1360
00:59:40,641 --> 00:59:42,830
I like touring.
I like going on trips.

1361
00:59:42,831 --> 00:59:44,080
Traveling right there.
Yeah,

1362
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:46,190
the red one up in the top,
middle.

1363
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:47,630
That's,
that's it.

1364
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:48,410
Yeah.
I said,

1365
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:49,580
man,
look at that thing.

1366
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:50,443
Yeah,
I got it outside when we're done I'll 

1367
00:59:51,201 --> 00:59:52,730
show it to you.
But those batches,

1368
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:55,100
we keep stuff in those things.
What do you keep?

1369
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,093
Yeah,
you can carry and keeping their high 

1370
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,250
keep.
That's why I use for whatever.

1371
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:02,121
You know,
what you keep in there,

1372
01:00:02,121 --> 01:00:03,950
her purse.
Oh that's right.

1373
01:00:03,951 --> 01:00:05,260
Because this guy told me that,
uh,

1374
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:08,540
they call those baggers that started a 
bike and he said,

1375
01:00:08,541 --> 01:00:10,450
man,
chicks love baggers and he ain't kid and

1376
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:12,050
stuff and they love it.
They love it.

1377
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:17,060
But now that's a big cruiser,
right?

1378
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:19,160
It's all loud bike.
No,

1379
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:20,300
no,
it's not loud.

1380
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,100
It,
it.

1381
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:24,160
It'll be a little louder next year I'm 
going to put pipes on it this winter and

1382
01:00:24,161 --> 01:00:25,550
Morocco,
but I'm not going.

1383
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:27,710
I'm not going crazy.
Like straight pipes that,

1384
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:30,400
you know,
set off car alarms and.

1385
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:31,570
No,
I just a little,

1386
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:34,040
little bit louder now when you have a 
bike like that,

1387
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:37,550
like the ideas that they're slower.
Right?

1388
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,970
But they're more comfortable then you 
know what that bike,

1389
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:44,450
that bike is.
Sunset Strip and pch.

1390
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:45,500
Ah,
just cruising.

1391
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,550
You know that.
That's what that.

1392
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:48,950
Yeah.
That's what that is.

1393
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:50,630
Comfortable.
You look good.

1394
01:00:50,631 --> 01:00:54,640
You got a stereo and you just chilling.
Now when you say our stereo,

1395
01:00:54,641 --> 01:00:56,000
like you can hear it.
Oh yeah.

1396
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:57,450
Yeah.
So you're blasting.

1397
01:00:57,451 --> 01:00:58,520
It's everybody here.
So yeah,

1398
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:02,600
it's a little weird.
Like I don't like being that guy,

1399
01:01:02,601 --> 01:01:04,700
one of them at a light,
you know what I mean?

1400
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:06,350
But,
but when you're riding along,

1401
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:08,630
nobody's really hearing it that much,
you know,

1402
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:09,740
you're passing people.
But yeah,

1403
01:01:09,741 --> 01:01:11,450
when you're sitting at a light.
So,

1404
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,580
and I know guys who go with,
you know,

1405
01:01:13,581 --> 01:01:15,470
a thousand watts and they,
their bags,

1406
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:16,970
their saddleback is a speaker.

1407
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:19,010
Like they're,
they're broadcasting,

1408
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:21,050
you know,
I don't want to be that guy,

1409
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:23,150
but it is kind of Nice.
Again,

1410
01:01:23,151 --> 01:01:26,180
this is stuff that I hadn't done until I
got to spike.

1411
01:01:26,181 --> 01:01:27,740
Right?
But now I'm realizing I'm like,

1412
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,080
this shit ain't bad if I'm cruising 
down,

1413
01:01:30,081 --> 01:01:33,050
you know,
Holland or pch or something like that.

1414
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,820
And I'm listening to music.
I'm like,

1415
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:35,893
yeah,
I can hear the music over the sound of 

1416
01:01:37,371 --> 01:01:39,040
the engine and the,
the,

1417
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:41,570
uh,
the speakers are loud enough systems,

1418
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:44,510
loud music blaring.
Mostly Jazz.

1419
01:01:44,511 --> 01:01:47,330
I'm chilling.
I'm a jazz jazz,

1420
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:49,280
jazz and hip hop.
Those are my two.

1421
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:50,173
You really do like jazz,
you one of those people I legitimately 

1422
01:01:53,391 --> 01:01:54,224
love Jasmine on the jazz is one of those
things that like weird dudes put on to 

1423
01:01:58,851 --> 01:02:03,770
pretend the girls that they're 
sophisticated,

1424
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:04,613
he likes,
there's some jazz that is like that and 

1425
01:02:07,131 --> 01:02:10,430
I'll admit I had to like learn that 
level of jazz.

1426
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:12,350
Like there's a level of jazz that's 
like,

1427
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:14,210
I'm like,
this girl I dated,

1428
01:02:14,211 --> 01:02:15,044
she would be like,
are you listening to that sketchy jazz 

1429
01:02:16,521 --> 01:02:19,590
shit?
That's the shit you have to listen to,

1430
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,140
to learn.
Because in the beginning only meet other

1431
01:02:22,141 --> 01:02:23,710
musicians understand it.
Right.

1432
01:02:23,711 --> 01:02:26,010
And I know some jazz musicians and they 
were breaking it down,

1433
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:28,170
but there's a lot of jazz.
It's just,

1434
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:31,590
I don't know.
I don't know how to explain it to music.

1435
01:02:31,591 --> 01:02:35,040
Played by master musicians and that's 
what,

1436
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:35,874
that's why it's good because when you 
listen to a guy like Robert Glasper 

1437
01:02:39,091 --> 01:02:42,540
who's really hot now or Herbie Hancock,
like when you listen to Herbie Hancock,

1438
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:44,070
play a piano,
you're like,

1439
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:46,110
oh,
that's how it's supposed to sound.

1440
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:47,550
You know what I mean?
Because he's just.

1441
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:50,640
He just has mastered that instrument.
You know,

1442
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:52,020
so,
so yeah,

1443
01:02:52,021 --> 01:02:54,120
I listened to some of that and it and it
can be,

1444
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,840
there's times when it's out there and 
it's meditative and shit like that,

1445
01:02:58,020 --> 01:02:58,853
but don't get me wrong.

1446
01:02:59,180 --> 01:02:59,881
You might,
you know,

1447
01:02:59,881 --> 01:03:02,130
you might pass by.
I might be cranking Jay z,

1448
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:05,190
you know,
I love hip hop,

1449
01:03:05,191 --> 01:03:06,570
love old school hip hop.
That shit.

1450
01:03:06,571 --> 01:03:10,050
I grew up with the old eighties.
Now you play music at all?

1451
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:11,543
No.
So a lot of people that learned to jazz 

1452
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:14,420
actually played music.
Yeah,

1453
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:15,293
a lot of them are.
I think I appreciate it because I have 

1454
01:03:17,911 --> 01:03:22,911
no musical talent.
So the masters of it fascinate me and in

1455
01:03:23,221 --> 01:03:27,150
the last 10 years I've been doing like 
these jazz cruises,

1456
01:03:27,151 --> 01:03:29,070
hosting jazz festivals and this and 
that,

1457
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:31,800
and I found it's really true.
Well you know this because you know,

1458
01:03:31,801 --> 01:03:32,634
musicians to that thing about every 
musician wants to be a comic and every 

1459
01:03:35,461 --> 01:03:40,050
comic wants to be a musician.
I definitely have this mutual admiration

1460
01:03:40,051 --> 01:03:41,760
thing with,
with jazz artists,

1461
01:03:41,761 --> 01:03:42,211
like,
man,

1462
01:03:42,211 --> 01:03:43,500
I wish I could play that.
And they're like,

1463
01:03:43,501 --> 01:03:44,610
man,
I wish I was funny.

1464
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:48,490
Yeah.
Well there's,

1465
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:50,460
there's something about.
They can,

1466
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:52,950
not jazz necessarily,
but people in bands,

1467
01:03:52,951 --> 01:03:56,010
they can play the same shit forever.
One thing I can't do,

1468
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:58,040
I get on jazz artists about that old 
time.

1469
01:03:58,190 --> 01:04:01,260
Like they'll play like there's a track 
called so what?

1470
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:02,640
By Miles Davis,
right?

1471
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:03,900
Classic.
Jazzy.

1472
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,153
Like miles wrote this in 1959 and you 
can play it and your considered 

1473
01:04:09,811 --> 01:04:11,170
brilliant.
Hm.

1474
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:13,180
How does that shit work?
How does that work?

1475
01:04:13,181 --> 01:04:18,110
At no point can I do Eddie Murphy's,
gunny boohoo and suddenly be that Alonza

1476
01:04:18,111 --> 01:04:23,100
was a brilliant comment.
You hear that goody Google maps for 59.

1477
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:26,070
Fifty nine.
Yeah.

1478
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:28,780
Fifty nine comedy.
Get fucking rockstar.

1479
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:31,860
Not Weird.
Like comedy from 59.

1480
01:04:31,861 --> 01:04:32,860
It's terrible.
Yeah.

1481
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:36,180
Try listening to some old Lenny Bruce,
so I'm a huge Lenny Bruce Fan.

1482
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:39,210
I've framed Lenny Bruce posters in my 
home,

1483
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:44,360
but if you tried to listen to it today,
it's the culture has bypass these ideas.

1484
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:45,823
Yeah,
it was revolutionary in groundbreaking 

1485
01:04:47,941 --> 01:04:48,774
at the time because the culture was so 
childish and infant tile and it's its 

1486
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:58,010
ideas and understanding of like weird 
concepts are abstract concepts or things

1487
01:04:58,501 --> 01:05:03,380
like a censorship or or racism or any of
the things that when Bruce Cover.

1488
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:06,030
Then when he was covering them back then
they were groundbreaking,

1489
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:09,540
but now like a lot of the stuff he's 
saying is just done.

1490
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:10,733
But I think I think a lot of those 
comics because years ago we were having 

1491
01:05:13,831 --> 01:05:16,170
this debate.
This is before rape.

1492
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,970
Okay.
We were having this debate about cosby.

1493
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,550
You got to put that qualifier in 
Brooklyn.

1494
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:22,770
Yeah.
You always have to end.

1495
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:25,150
It was.
If he started today,

1496
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:26,103
would he make it?
And I argued yes because his comedy 

1497
01:05:30,611 --> 01:05:32,470
would have been different.
Like he still,

1498
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:33,333
you know what I mean,
like,

1499
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:34,323
like Lenny Bruce,
he wouldn't have been talking about the 

1500
01:05:36,341 --> 01:05:38,890
things he was talking about and 59 or 
60,

1501
01:05:38,891 --> 01:05:41,680
he'd be talking about the same shit that
we talk about today,

1502
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:43,293
but he still would have had that 
brilliant comic mind and he still would 

1503
01:05:45,841 --> 01:05:47,860
have been.
Who knows what he had been talking about

1504
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:50,140
because he'd have been kicking down 
doors today.

1505
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:52,720
Sure.
So he would've been just at some,

1506
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:54,280
you know,
different.

1507
01:05:54,281 --> 01:05:57,640
But I think those comics,
most of them,

1508
01:05:57,730 --> 01:05:59,800
that's the brilliant.
Definitely the brilliant ones.

1509
01:05:59,801 --> 01:06:03,400
The top ones would be funny today.
They just talk about the topics.

1510
01:06:03,401 --> 01:06:04,080
We talk about

1511
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,190
100 percent.
Yeah,

1512
01:06:05,191 --> 01:06:06,024
I think so too.
I think it's just a matter of the time 

1513
01:06:07,711 --> 01:06:10,890
and the error that they existed in and.
But conversely,

1514
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:11,813
if you took someone from today,
like if you took dave chappelle and yet 

1515
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,330
dave chappelle doing standup at 1960,
they'd probably be like,

1516
01:06:18,331 --> 01:06:20,290
what the fuck are you talking about?
Yeah.

1517
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:21,173
What are you doing?
You're talking about a baby selling 

1518
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:27,560
crap.
Kids didn't seem chappelle in 1959.

1519
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,710
Never would have never.
Well just.

1520
01:06:31,830 --> 01:06:32,663
Well,
it's just,

1521
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,790
it's not relevant,
right?

1522
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:37,530
It has to be relevant to the time,
you know,

1523
01:06:37,590 --> 01:06:38,423
a brilliant comedian of today trying to 
talk about the same subjects we talk 

1524
01:06:41,011 --> 01:06:42,740
about today.
It's just you.

1525
01:06:43,490 --> 01:06:44,323
You know what I mean?
That's the weird thing about comedy 

1526
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:48,010
really does reflect the era in which

1527
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:49,880
performed.
It's absolutely,

1528
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:51,920
it's the culture that we're in.
I mean it was,

1529
01:06:51,921 --> 01:06:54,590
you know,
it was Vaudeville right when,

1530
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:56,530
when all you had to do with juggle and 
hit a guy

1531
01:06:56,650 --> 01:06:59,830
would hammer.
That was all,

1532
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:01,463
you got that old hammer bit when they 
were here would do like a Japanese 

1533
01:07:05,441 --> 01:07:07,630
impression and put like a cigar in his 
mouth,

1534
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:11,470
you know,
like the buck to haul.

1535
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,340
Why?
Why that?

1536
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,193
I never understood that.
Like how does that represent Japanese 

1537
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:16,360
people?
The buck tooth thing.

1538
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:19,140
Who was it to the debt?
There was a guy who did that.

1539
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:22,070
I can't remember,
but I know you're talking about them.

1540
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:23,850
Picture in it.
Yeah.

1541
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:25,670
Yeah.
It definitely,

1542
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:26,563
definitely what we do as well,
just in the time I'd say even in the 

1543
01:07:29,271 --> 01:07:30,104
time we've been doing it.
I mean I started in [inaudible] 93 and 

1544
01:07:34,491 --> 01:07:37,560
it's definitely different now than you 
know,

1545
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:40,760
than it was then.
That was def jam right when I was.

1546
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:44,550
Excuse me,
when I started out def jam was it?

1547
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:47,450
And,
and I caught a lot of hell being a black

1548
01:07:47,451 --> 01:07:50,820
comic who wasn't a def jam type out 
comments.

1549
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:52,880
It was like,
what the hell you talking about?

1550
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:54,860
Right.
And it was like,

1551
01:07:54,861 --> 01:07:56,270
I'm on,
I'm on NPR,

1552
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:01,220
you know,
which now is cool,

1553
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:04,030
but in [inaudible] 94 probably wouldn't 
have been the coolest,

1554
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,130
coolest thing.
Oh

1555
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:06,120
yeah.
Isn't that interesting?

1556
01:08:06,121 --> 01:08:07,190
Like uh,
you,

1557
01:08:07,191 --> 01:08:09,840
you get expected to fit into a certain 
genre,

1558
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:10,710
right?
Yeah.

1559
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,980
And then there's like there's markets 
for that genre.

1560
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:16,010
Yeah.
Like when def jam

1561
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:16,843
was big,
like there's a market for that kind of 

1562
01:08:18,141 --> 01:08:23,000
comedy and a lot of you saw a lot of 
comedians like mold themselves into that

1563
01:08:23,001 --> 01:08:24,030
market.
Yeah.

1564
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:24,883
And I always thought,
and I was lucky in that a few of the 

1565
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:28,553
pros I'm like,
I remember like cedric the entertainer 

1566
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:32,473
was one and Tommy Davidson was another 
and George Wallace was another who told 

1567
01:08:37,431 --> 01:08:39,080
me like,
just do like,

1568
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:42,890
do you like you cannot,
like don't worry about that shit because

1569
01:08:43,730 --> 01:08:46,810
the only thing worse than being a deaf 
guy would not,

1570
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:48,553
would be a fake def jam comic.
That was the only thing worse than not 

1571
01:08:50,991 --> 01:08:51,824
fitting in would be a fake def jam.
Like for me to suddenly pretend like I 

1572
01:08:56,301 --> 01:08:58,820
grew up in Queens.
I grew up in St Albans,

1573
01:08:58,821 --> 01:09:00,320
Queens,
working class,

1574
01:09:00,321 --> 01:09:03,110
black neighborhood.
My parents both had jobs,

1575
01:09:03,111 --> 01:09:06,890
but we had a house with a yard and the 
two car garage and the whole bit.

1576
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:07,641
Right.
Not Rich,

1577
01:09:07,641 --> 01:09:09,020
not poor,
just working class.

1578
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:10,243
If I tried to come at you like I grew up
in the south bronx and I have friends 

1579
01:09:13,011 --> 01:09:14,380
from the South Bronx,
you know,

1580
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:15,463
I have friends from Bedstuy,
but it would have been fake and you'd 

1581
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:21,310
have seen right through it.
If you were from bed Stuy,

1582
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:23,330
you'd have seen through my ass in a 
minute.

1583
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:25,003
You know,
I might have fooled you if you were 

1584
01:09:26,271 --> 01:09:27,010
from,
you know,

1585
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:29,720
I don't know,
Colorado or some shit for me.

1586
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:31,790
Davidson,
Tommy Davidson.

1587
01:09:31,791 --> 01:09:33,980
Where's he at?
Tommy still out there.

1588
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:35,210
Tommy still,
uh,

1589
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:38,150
clubs and doing this thing on rare 
occasions.

1590
01:09:38,151 --> 01:09:40,580
Once in a while,
but I'll always have love for Tommy.

1591
01:09:40,581 --> 01:09:45,581
Tommy helped me when I was new.
Tommy took me on the road with him for a

1592
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:49,280
summer and I learned a lot and he 
introduced me to clubs that I got into.

1593
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:50,840
You know,
Tommy was.

1594
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:53,450
Tommy was a brilliant talent.
Um,

1595
01:09:53,451 --> 01:09:54,284
the drug thing really hurt Tommy,
he went through that phase and I think 

1596
01:09:59,481 --> 01:10:04,481
what hurt him with that was that he 
developed a reputation for unreliability

1597
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:07,490
where he,
you know,

1598
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:12,290
people like is he going to show up?
And it was the worst thing to hear,

1599
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:16,100
but talent wise,
he was just amazing.

1600
01:10:16,101 --> 01:10:16,934
Like I would watch Tommy worked some 
nights when Tommy did a story and I 

1601
01:10:20,481 --> 01:10:21,314
don't know how much you've ever seen him
on stage and with a bunch of the store 

1602
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:24,673
when he starts becoming each different 
character in the story with his voices 

1603
01:10:28,911 --> 01:10:30,920
and singing and shit.
Brilliant.

1604
01:10:31,070 --> 01:10:31,611
Yeah.
Really.

1605
01:10:31,611 --> 01:10:35,600
I used to watch that and just be blown 
away that he had that kind of talent.

1606
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:37,010
The fucking drug thing,
man,

1607
01:10:37,011 --> 01:10:39,710
that's the drug to that cocaine drug.
You know,

1608
01:10:39,711 --> 01:10:41,960
when you talk about the drug thing,
it's very rarely the pot.

1609
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:43,670
That's always the drug thing.
It's like,

1610
01:10:43,671 --> 01:10:44,504
oh,
what's he doing?

1611
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,393
You know,
math,

1612
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,600
coke,
speed ones,

1613
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:50,420
right.
Do people or the booze,

1614
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:52,620
booze do people into.
Well,

1615
01:10:52,621 --> 01:10:53,240
the thing,
and you know,

1616
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,073
we talked about on the last podcast,
I went through the coke and the crack 

1617
01:10:56,391 --> 01:10:59,990
thing and what happens when you get 
addicted to drugs like that,

1618
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:02,930
they just dominate your life.
So you can't,

1619
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:06,150
you can't do anything else because the 
drug domination,

1620
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:10,160
now it's heroin right now.
You've got people on oxy and heroin and,

1621
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:13,190
and you know,
you literally see them in a nod.

1622
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,430
I was in Cleveland

1623
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:17,070
um,
early this past summer,

1624
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:19,110
downtown Cleveland,
Ohio.

1625
01:11:19,111 --> 01:11:19,944
It's got this like one of the bad opioid
things and you would just literally see 

1626
01:11:23,311 --> 01:11:26,670
people on the bench just nodding,
like going into it.

1627
01:11:26,770 --> 01:11:27,990
I was like,
Holy Shit,

1628
01:11:27,991 --> 01:11:28,860
this is,
you know,

1629
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:30,930
this.
I mean it's been there but.

1630
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,330
But when people are sitting out on a 
park bench,

1631
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:36,300
just going into a nod,
we got a problem.

1632
01:11:37,370 --> 01:11:38,203
Well,
the problem in Massachusetts to Rizza 

1633
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:41,993
Anthony Bourdain show he was doing about
it recently where the problem in 

1634
01:11:43,561 --> 01:11:48,510
Massachusetts was that they were giving 
out pain pills to people so easily.

1635
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:50,910
Yeah.
And people got hooked and then when they

1636
01:11:50,911 --> 01:11:54,720
try to get off the pain pills,
because they were tightened down,

1637
01:11:54,721 --> 01:11:57,750
the read the regulations on them,
then people started turning to heroin.

1638
01:11:57,940 --> 01:11:58,773
Right.
And that was a thing in the nineties 

1639
01:12:00,181 --> 01:12:01,014
with the opioids when,
when they came out with Oxycontin and 

1640
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:06,530
all those related drugs,
they told the doctor it's not,

1641
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:07,290
it's not addicting.

1642
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:08,123
Go ahead and write the prescription.
And now some of those pharmaceutical 

1643
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:11,034
companies are paying like big lawsuits 
because they knew back then that it was 

1644
01:12:14,491 --> 01:12:15,330
addicting.
Yeah.

1645
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,164
I was just talking to another friend of 
mine the other day about a pain pills 

1646
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:22,320
got addicted.
He was a recovering from a surgery.

1647
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,273
They gave him some pain pills and then 
he had some complications with the 

1648
01:12:25,771 --> 01:12:27,070
recovery.
I think it was a.

1649
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,010
God damn it,
I can't remember.

1650
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:29,844
It was up near maybe as a knee surgery.
They had to do a re done another 

1651
01:12:33,301 --> 01:12:34,134
surgery.
They had to go in and because it has 

1652
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:35,953
some scar tissue and there's like know 
four weeks later they'd go and do 

1653
01:12:39,211 --> 01:12:40,810
another surgery.
Uh,

1654
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:41,693
they give them more pain pills.
So now he's on pain pills for three 

1655
01:12:43,771 --> 01:12:47,240
months and then he tries to get off of 
him and he says,

1656
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:51,450
yeah,
you have to be taken off of a medical.

1657
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:53,250
You're not supposed to just go cold 
Turkey.

1658
01:12:53,251 --> 01:12:55,890
Some people do.
But meanwhile no one told him no.

1659
01:12:55,891 --> 01:12:56,910
Nobody tells you.
I mean,

1660
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:59,100
told them anything and he's all of a 
sudden a heroin addict.

1661
01:12:59,101 --> 01:13:00,450
He said,
what in the fuck happened?

1662
01:13:00,451 --> 01:13:03,660
I'm an opioid addict.
I had a tooth extracted and they gave me

1663
01:13:03,661 --> 01:13:05,480
like,
I don't know,

1664
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:07,830
20 Vicodin,
trust something,

1665
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:09,070
you know,
for the week or something.

1666
01:13:09,071 --> 01:13:11,130
And it's like,
it's a tooth.

1667
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:14,400
This done.
I'm going to be okay.

1668
01:13:14,401 --> 01:13:16,500
It's going to be sore for a day and I'll
be uh,

1669
01:13:16,501 --> 01:13:17,550
but,
but it's what they do.

1670
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:22,170
It's how they write the script and then 
you get people who will sell them,

1671
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:23,280
right?
Who will be like,

1672
01:13:23,281 --> 01:13:24,630
oh,
I got these pills.

1673
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,010
Yeah,
I can just sell them.

1674
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,530
I sold mine.
When I had my knee operation I took,

1675
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:31,440
it was either vicodin or percocet.
I can't remember which one it was,

1676
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:32,543
but it made me so fucked up that uh,
I sold them to a friend of mine at the 

1677
01:13:35,521 --> 01:13:37,140
pool hall,
so I can't take this shit.

1678
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:38,003
I just put me in a coma.
I took back in once and in the same way 

1679
01:13:40,471 --> 01:13:42,060
I got sick.
I didn't like,

1680
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:46,630
I didn't like the feeling and I didn't 
understand why people did exactly.

1681
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:47,543
This is the high you want.
I have a friend who's a musician who is 

1682
01:13:50,491 --> 01:13:54,420
really creative on Viking and he said he
writes music on Viking and I'm like,

1683
01:13:54,421 --> 01:13:56,460
what?
Like what?

1684
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:57,713
He plays classical guitar,
takes Vicodin and just zones out and 

1685
01:14:00,691 --> 01:14:02,270
writes classical guitar music.
I'm like,

1686
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:04,651
don't get it,
man.

1687
01:14:04,651 --> 01:14:07,310
I felt so stupid when I took that.
I didn't,

1688
01:14:07,470 --> 01:14:10,380
I didn't like that.
I didn't like that feeling,

1689
01:14:10,381 --> 01:14:12,010
but I don't.
Being in a little

1690
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:14,260
pain,
it's like I get it.

1691
01:14:14,261 --> 01:14:18,310
I'm hurt.
There is a reason you have pain,

1692
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:19,390
right?
Your body saying,

1693
01:14:19,391 --> 01:14:20,590
hey,
some shit's wrong here.

1694
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:23,380
Exactly.
Pay attention to it or don't use this.

1695
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:25,330
Don't use this body part.
Right?

1696
01:14:25,331 --> 01:14:27,520
Like if your elbow hurts or something to
your body saying,

1697
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,500
okay,
don't use the elbow for a week.

1698
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:31,130
Yeah,
he don't pick that up,

1699
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:36,010
but if you just know,
it's just so

1700
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:39,220
another reason not to be in the NFL.

1701
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:42,470
People just need to be comfortable being
uncomfortable.

1702
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:45,650
Just relax.
Just understand that this is a.

1703
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:48,080
This is gonna make you appreciate the 
good times.

1704
01:14:48,081 --> 01:14:48,914
Right?
Because like right now you're in a bad 

1705
01:14:49,851 --> 01:14:51,320
place,
but that doesn't happen.

1706
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,240
The moon,
we go a long time ago.

1707
01:14:54,510 --> 01:14:56,010
Stan hope.
Did a bit about that.

1708
01:14:56,011 --> 01:14:58,440
Write about anything you feel is a drug 
for it.

1709
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,890
Like any physical or emotional feeling 
you have.

1710
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:04,920
I didn't see that drug for.
It's a long time ago.

1711
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:06,370
Yeah,
but he's right.

1712
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:08,940
Anything,
anything.

1713
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:10,490
There's a drug to make it

1714
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,000
better.
When I got my nose fixed,

1715
01:15:12,030 --> 01:15:12,863
I got a deviated septum operated on.
They pulled out a bunch of scar tissue 

1716
01:15:15,541 --> 01:15:18,630
and shit,
but I'm telling you there was no pain.

1717
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:22,560
I mean it was uncomfortable for as much 
time as they had the packet.

1718
01:15:22,830 --> 01:15:23,663
Yeah.
It was packed up with a gauze or these 

1719
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,033
foam things with tubes hanging out that 
dripped like the blood is dripping out 

1720
01:15:30,661 --> 01:15:32,670
of it.
That was uncomfortable.

1721
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:33,533
But what I mean uncomfortable,
like it doesn't feel good to shove both 

1722
01:15:36,061 --> 01:15:37,560
fingers up your nose and leave them 
there.

1723
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:41,880
I wasn't in pain and my doctor was 
pushing the pills on me.

1724
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:42,953
He gave me two different prescriptions 
for pain pills for vicodins and I think 

1725
01:15:46,321 --> 01:15:47,970
of the other ones roxies and I was like,
man,

1726
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,770
this doesn't hurt.
And he's like,

1727
01:15:49,771 --> 01:15:51,120
well it might hurt later.
I'm like,

1728
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:54,090
how's it going to hurt?
Like what is he going to get?

1729
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,590
Something's going to change.
Like,

1730
01:15:55,591 --> 01:15:57,570
what's going to change?
Like how's it going to hurt later?

1731
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,660
Like right now it's just like my nose 
feels uncomfortable.

1732
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:02,280
Like it's not,
it's not painful though.

1733
01:16:02,281 --> 01:16:04,170
I just,
I think people just,

1734
01:16:04,230 --> 01:16:05,063
you get told by your doctor that you're 
going to be in pain and you might be 

1735
01:16:08,101 --> 01:16:09,420
uncomfortable.
So I have some pills for,

1736
01:16:09,421 --> 01:16:10,001
you know,
like Jesus,

1737
01:16:10,001 --> 01:16:11,460
I better take these pills for it gets 
bad.

1738
01:16:11,790 --> 01:16:13,950
I better take these pills before I can't
take it anymore.

1739
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:18,620
And he started freaking out.
I will say this,

1740
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:23,510
I did find out the medical use for 
cocaine and it absolutely works numbing.

1741
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:25,530
Yeah.
I had um,

1742
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:28,010
a ripped cornea.
Yeah.

1743
01:16:28,110 --> 01:16:31,170
Playing Ball.
This guy finger ripped across and,

1744
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:35,330
and I'm talking the kind of pain where 
you just hit the ground,

1745
01:16:35,331 --> 01:16:37,460
like you're just done.
Like your body is like,

1746
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:38,780
don't do shit,
you are in May.

1747
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,760
And I went to the doctor and that's what
they use.

1748
01:16:40,761 --> 01:16:45,761
They put liquid cocaine eye drops in my 
eye and the pain disappeared instantly.

1749
01:16:46,311 --> 01:16:47,270
I was like,
can I?

1750
01:16:47,271 --> 01:16:48,380
And he was like,
no,

1751
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:49,333
we don't prescribe these.
You have to come in and we have to put 

1752
01:16:51,771 --> 01:16:53,390
them in the eye.
But I will say,

1753
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:55,880
you know how when you go to the doctor 
and you're like,

1754
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:58,220
make it better.
Like that's always your dream.

1755
01:16:58,221 --> 01:16:59,690
Like just make it better.
So I could leave.

1756
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:02,600
He made it better.
The pain just went away.

1757
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:06,350
They put lidacain up my nose.
When I got the,

1758
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:06,740
um,

1759
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:10,910
the Gaza sucked out,
pull the plugs out and he sprays,

1760
01:17:10,911 --> 01:17:11,910
lie to cane up there.
I'm going,

1761
01:17:12,030 --> 01:17:15,620
I've had that stuff a couple of times.
One time from a real bad sunburn.

1762
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:19,130
I put Lidacain all over my back and it's
the same feeling.

1763
01:17:19,131 --> 01:17:20,870
It's like I'll never,
I'll never do it again.

1764
01:17:20,871 --> 01:17:23,900
I'll just take the pain because the 
feeling that you get from La to Kansas,

1765
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:26,270
this gross,
weird,

1766
01:17:26,271 --> 01:17:29,420
like he feels sketchy.
Like your heart feels sketchy,

1767
01:17:29,421 --> 01:17:32,240
like who you feel like you don't want to
eat,

1768
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:33,103
but you know,
you probably should but it's a lie to 

1769
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:37,700
king,
gives you a very weird feeling.

1770
01:17:37,701 --> 01:17:39,350
And I,
I was eating that night,

1771
01:17:39,351 --> 01:17:40,184
I went to a dinner and I was eating at 
the steak place and I was like barely 

1772
01:17:42,981 --> 01:17:43,461
hung.
I'm like,

1773
01:17:43,461 --> 01:17:46,310
why do I feel like shit?
And then I realized like,

1774
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:47,203
oh,
they pumped that fucking lie to cane in 

1775
01:17:48,751 --> 01:17:49,584
my notes.

1776
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:52,920
It went in your system but it wouldn't 
use.

1777
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:54,043
I swallowed it could taste it,
could taste it in the back because 

1778
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:57,253
they're pumping it up your nose because 
I should've just them yank that stuff 

1779
01:18:00,081 --> 01:18:00,914
out.
Just pull it out because it was really 

1780
01:18:02,001 --> 01:18:03,500
no big deal,
you know?

1781
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:04,453
But they,
they have you convinced that you're 

1782
01:18:05,631 --> 01:18:07,260
going to be in agony,
you know?

1783
01:18:07,410 --> 01:18:09,120
Yeah.
And different people have different pain

1784
01:18:09,121 --> 01:18:12,150
tolerance.
Some people are pussies.

1785
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:13,200
Yeah.
Yeah.

1786
01:18:13,201 --> 01:18:13,830
Some people.
Okay.

1787
01:18:13,830 --> 01:18:15,720
And then others can,
you know,

1788
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:16,593
can take it.

1789
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:19,800
Well that's the thing about Jujitsu,
Jujitsu,

1790
01:18:19,950 --> 01:18:22,220
doing Jujitsu for 20 plus years or 
whatever I've done.

1791
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:24,110
You're always in pain.
You just,

1792
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:26,240
you just get used to compartmentalizing 
like,

1793
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:29,510
oh my arm's fucked up.
So just accept it and deal with it.

1794
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:34,070
Because if you took a pain pill every 
time you were injured from Jujitsu.

1795
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:35,423
Yeah,

1796
01:18:35,570 --> 01:18:38,370
you're good on them all junky.
You're going to be a junkie,

1797
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:40,920
you know,
that's why I avoid Jujitsu.

1798
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:42,640
Good.
Good.

1799
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:44,293
Good call.
Stay on those days when I used to play 

1800
01:18:48,251 --> 01:18:50,040
basketball all the time though.
That's the way it was.

1801
01:18:50,041 --> 01:18:53,560
It was like my knees always hurt or 
something.

1802
01:18:53,561 --> 01:18:54,211
Yeah.
Something,

1803
01:18:54,211 --> 01:18:56,760
you know.
And the funniest one.

1804
01:18:56,761 --> 01:18:57,594
We were in this basketball league and 
everyone on my team was like mid 

1805
01:19:01,981 --> 01:19:02,671
thirties,
you know,

1806
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:04,130
30 to 35,
whatever.

1807
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:06,450
And we were playing these kids,
these kids were like 19,

1808
01:19:06,451 --> 01:19:10,350
20 and we walked into the gym and they 
go right on the court.

1809
01:19:10,510 --> 01:19:13,020
They are running it and our whole team 
is sitting there.

1810
01:19:13,230 --> 01:19:17,150
You're rapping shit up with tape,
you're rubbing bengay or something,

1811
01:19:17,151 --> 01:19:17,984
whatever.
She got like our whole team is on the 

1812
01:19:19,861 --> 01:19:22,200
bed just warming up like rubbing and 
wrapping,

1813
01:19:22,370 --> 01:19:24,440
looking at them like,
well we beat them,

1814
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:25,620
you know,
we were veterans,

1815
01:19:25,621 --> 01:19:26,454
we knew what we were doing,
but it was such an obvious thing in the 

1816
01:19:28,531 --> 01:19:29,364
beginning.
Like if Ellis we get notes and now all 

1817
01:19:31,441 --> 01:19:32,274
of those guys.
So he used to play ball with all play 

1818
01:19:33,601 --> 01:19:34,434
golf.
Like that's the retired sport if I like 

1819
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:41,340
am place playing ball on hard concrete 
to like those parts

1820
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,700
surfaces.
That shit has got to be terrible for you

1821
01:19:43,701 --> 01:19:46,090
all to stop and start and bouncing 
around and

1822
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:48,950
well doctors will tell you the nice 
aren't made for sports,

1823
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:50,323
you know,
especially not running and jumping 

1824
01:19:52,341 --> 01:19:53,510
sports.
But when you're,

1825
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:54,373
when you're a kid,
nobody's gonna tell you not to play 

1826
01:19:56,451 --> 01:19:57,740
ball.
You know what I mean?

1827
01:19:57,890 --> 01:19:58,723
Like,
it's funny to me when I'm watching 

1828
01:19:59,481 --> 01:20:02,510
college basketball and they're like,
these guys are tired.

1829
01:20:02,511 --> 01:20:02,871
I'm like,
no,

1830
01:20:02,871 --> 01:20:03,704
they're not.
They're 19 and they're playing 

1831
01:20:05,481 --> 01:20:06,740
basketball.
If they weren't here,

1832
01:20:06,741 --> 01:20:10,700
you know where they be playing 
basketball at the gym.

1833
01:20:11,710 --> 01:20:14,220
So yeah,
there were a lot of things.

1834
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:16,100
They're not tired right now.
They,

1835
01:20:16,101 --> 01:20:16,934
they,
you know,

1836
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:19,680
they may have lost concentration.
They made this,

1837
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:23,190
that the other but tired.
You're a 19 year old athlete,

1838
01:20:23,191 --> 01:20:24,510
you know,
Kinda shaped those guys.

1839
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,760
Like they're not tired.
Well,

1840
01:20:26,761 --> 01:20:29,280
basketball on a hardwood floor seems to 
be.

1841
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:30,460
It have a little gift.
Yeah.

1842
01:20:30,461 --> 01:20:32,490
It's got a little gift to it and you 
need.

1843
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:34,830
The shoes are so much better now.
I mean,

1844
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:36,510
you,
you ever put on a pair of converse?

1845
01:20:36,511 --> 01:20:37,920
Chuck Taylors?
I wear them all the time.

1846
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:41,760
Imagine playing like imagine running and
jumping in those.

1847
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,460
Well there's an argument for you because
you develop,

1848
01:20:44,461 --> 01:20:45,294
strengthen your feet like that.
What you're dealing with with these 

1849
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:48,923
basketball shoes is essentially like a 
big rubber cast and that these rubber 

1850
01:20:52,201 --> 01:20:55,560
cast and all the cushioning and all that
jazz actually weakens your feet.

1851
01:20:55,720 --> 01:21:00,450
I don't buy it because I can't.
I have this one pair of Nike's,

1852
01:21:00,451 --> 01:21:01,284
I don't know what they are.
They're air something but they got the 

1853
01:21:02,581 --> 01:21:05,550
full air so.
And they're the only shoes I can run in.

1854
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:07,220
Right you today.
But you wait,

1855
01:21:07,221 --> 01:21:09,490
what?
Two 40 to 50.

1856
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:12,030
Yeah,
but so they make no mistake.

1857
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:14,760
These guys are big.
These guys six,

1858
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:16,320
seven,
200,

1859
01:21:16,370 --> 01:21:19,290
200 plus stomping and everything like 
that.

1860
01:21:19,290 --> 01:21:20,123
I guess like especially you got to 
consider basketball players are playing 

1861
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,390
how many days a week for how many 
months?

1862
01:21:24,391 --> 01:21:25,224
A year.
I mean and then in the off season and 

1863
01:21:26,731 --> 01:21:28,260
it's not like they just lay around and 
get fat.

1864
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:30,090
Right.
They're worth me also.

1865
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:35,040
And also you've got to look at how much 
money is invested in that player.

1866
01:21:35,041 --> 01:21:35,820
You know what I mean?
Like,

1867
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:36,653
like you just wanted Russell Westbrook 
just sign for 200 and whatever million 

1868
01:21:41,011 --> 01:21:43,680
dollars.
You better believe his feet are going to

1869
01:21:43,681 --> 01:21:44,514
be taken care of.
Like whatever shoes he's playing in are 

1870
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:51,630
going to be the best thing possible for 
his feet because we've got $40,000,000

1871
01:21:51,631 --> 01:21:54,300
a year invested in and gets a contract 
like that.

1872
01:21:54,630 --> 01:21:56,670
Did the hose just start circling like 
paltrow?

1873
01:21:56,730 --> 01:21:57,600
No,
they've been there.

1874
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:58,553
They've been there.
You,

1875
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,980
you get hoses around way before 2 
million.

1876
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:03,913
But once,
once that happens they start thinking 

1877
01:22:05,671 --> 01:22:09,240
all I need is one sperm to crack the egg
and I'm good.

1878
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:10,253
Right.
There's a lot of gals out there like 

1879
01:22:11,071 --> 01:22:12,810
that back in.
Okay.

1880
01:22:12,811 --> 01:22:14,160
What was it?
80 eight,

1881
01:22:14,161 --> 01:22:14,994
89.
I used to play ball at valley college 

1882
01:22:17,221 --> 01:22:18,600
all the time,
like pick up all.

1883
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:20,250
But it was high level.
There were good,

1884
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:21,113
you know,
I played with guys who had been in like 

1885
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:26,250
d one who had played division one league
and stuff like that.

1886
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:28,103
The NBA Rehab was in Van Nuys and on 
weekends they would come to the gym and 

1887
01:22:32,821 --> 01:22:33,654
they play ball with us right now I got 
to know a few players and this one guy 

1888
01:22:37,021 --> 01:22:38,720
told me,
and this was an 80,

1889
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:39,810
like I said,
88,

1890
01:22:39,811 --> 01:22:40,644
89.
He said an NBA kid is worth 100 grand a 

1891
01:22:44,221 --> 01:22:47,600
year for 18 years.
He said,

1892
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:50,160
do use checks,
poke holes in the condoms.

1893
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:52,470
He was like,
you can't trust any of them.

1894
01:22:53,090 --> 01:22:56,550
And that was then with that kind of my,
that was back when,

1895
01:22:56,551 --> 01:22:59,550
you know,
$5 million was a huge contract.

1896
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:00,413
Right.
You know,

1897
01:23:00,690 --> 01:23:05,680
so you can only imagine now because it 
seems fairly inexpensive,

1898
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:08,080
will take care of a child.
But again,

1899
01:23:08,081 --> 01:23:10,450
in [inaudible] 89,
this was back in [inaudible] 89.

1900
01:23:10,451 --> 01:23:14,140
So now that that hundred grand is 
probably half a million probably.

1901
01:23:14,141 --> 01:23:15,160
Right.
And you look,

1902
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:18,340
I think the,
the average salary in the NBA,

1903
01:23:18,341 --> 01:23:21,910
including the guys on the bench is like 
two point 3 million.

1904
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:22,983
Isn't that funny too?
Because when you think about like say 

1905
01:23:25,181 --> 01:23:27,460
the average person makes like what 70 
grand,

1906
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:30,850
60 grand a year is that minimum wage?
Not Minimum wage.

1907
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,220
Middle class was middle middle class,
like 60,

1908
01:23:33,221 --> 01:23:36,250
70 here in California is I think across 
America.

1909
01:23:36,251 --> 01:23:37,084
I think it's like 40 something so.
But the idea that this baby would live 

1910
01:23:43,031 --> 01:23:43,870
like that,
it's like,

1911
01:23:43,871 --> 01:23:44,251
no,
no,

1912
01:23:44,251 --> 01:23:44,670
no,
no,

1913
01:23:44,670 --> 01:23:45,720
no.
Like,

1914
01:23:45,790 --> 01:23:49,330
you know,
the guy doesn't even know the kid.

1915
01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:51,190
Right?
She's taking care of it.

1916
01:23:51,191 --> 01:23:53,200
It doesn't even know her.
Like if,

1917
01:23:53,230 --> 01:23:54,063
if he has to be child support,
like you're not know you're playing 

1918
01:23:55,991 --> 01:23:56,770
child support.

1919
01:23:56,770 --> 01:23:58,620
Like lavish.
Lavish.

1920
01:23:58,710 --> 01:23:59,580
Yeah.
You can't.

1921
01:23:59,590 --> 01:24:00,423
You like the average person likes if the
average family is existing off of 50 to 

1922
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:05,530
$70,000
a year,

1923
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:10,180
but this woman wants a half a million 
for a super baby.

1924
01:24:10,270 --> 01:24:11,380
Yeah.
It's fascinating.

1925
01:24:11,381 --> 01:24:12,214
Right?
It's like we have these weird rules 

1926
01:24:13,301 --> 01:24:15,040
like,
well how lean minute,

1927
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:19,810
why is that the case?
Because it's what dad makes right now to

1928
01:24:19,830 --> 01:24:20,663
what dad makes.
But I mean you're not asking someone to 

1929
01:24:22,241 --> 01:24:25,930
pay for the kids living expenses when 
you're asking someone to keep.

1930
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:30,570
Keep a kid in the lap of luxury and then
the mom's going to buy a car and and get

1931
01:24:30,571 --> 01:24:33,490
her nails did and that's the fight that 
dads have.

1932
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:35,620
A lot of the dads were like,
well just send me the bill.

1933
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:38,410
Send me the bill for private school.
What does this here,

1934
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:40,300
Antonio,
how you say his name?

1935
01:24:40,301 --> 01:24:41,134
Marty.
Marty just had number 14 is $3 million 

1936
01:24:43,541 --> 01:24:44,374
dollar deal from the colts and 
immediately used it to settle a child 

1937
01:24:46,991 --> 01:24:51,160
support dispute with a baby mama to 
avoid possible arrest in the process.

1938
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:55,930
Cromarty was delinquent on child support
payments to Rosa Meta.

1939
01:24:55,931 --> 01:24:57,760
Pierre.
Sounds like a lovely lady.

1940
01:24:58,060 --> 01:25:00,100
The mother of Alonzo,
his oldest child,

1941
01:25:00,101 --> 01:25:04,650
AK number one of 13 kids.
14 to 14.

1942
01:25:04,670 --> 01:25:05,503
Well,
uh,

1943
01:25:05,710 --> 01:25:08,710
he was ordered to pay her $4,000
per month.

1944
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:11,140
That's not that bad.
That's actually reasonable.

1945
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:13,390
Now multiply that by 14.
That's a lot.

1946
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:17,140
Tubes tied to the last year.
And I still had a kid.

1947
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:18,280
Damn,
that's some powerful.

1948
01:25:18,870 --> 01:25:19,703
I'm gonna.
See what it looks like.

1949
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:21,850
Scroll up.
He's like,

1950
01:25:21,851 --> 01:25:22,690
what the fuck?

1951
01:25:25,730 --> 01:25:29,680
Uh,
which is why,

1952
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:30,543
you know,
when you get to to captain nick and the 

1953
01:25:32,021 --> 01:25:35,200
boycott of football and so people are 
mad at the players will play in.

1954
01:25:35,201 --> 01:25:38,890
It's like that's why you got to play 
because you got 14 kids.

1955
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,290
Capital boycott of football was like 
what?

1956
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:42,550
What does that have to do with 
transport?

1957
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:44,030
Meaning that,
um,

1958
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:44,913
the,
the idea of black people boycotting 

1959
01:25:47,951 --> 01:25:51,130
football and then people saying like,
why did the players play like,

1960
01:25:51,131 --> 01:25:51,821
you know,
screw them,

1961
01:25:51,821 --> 01:25:53,910
but everybody,
every black player,

1962
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:56,280
the nfl just refused to play.
Like,

1963
01:25:56,350 --> 01:25:57,580
no,
that ain't gonna happen.

1964
01:25:58,420 --> 01:25:59,253
They need their paychecks.
This whole national anthem thing along 

1965
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:04,093
football is very weird.
It's like football players should be 

1966
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:10,280
playing football.
UFC fighters don't have to fucking stand

1967
01:26:10,281 --> 01:26:11,114
there with their hand over their heart 
to show allegiance and to show you know 

1968
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:15,913
what you're,
you're basically asking someone to be 

1969
01:26:18,141 --> 01:26:19,010
domesticated.

1970
01:26:19,650 --> 01:26:20,483
You're asking them to follow the rules.
The truth has come out like players 

1971
01:26:23,931 --> 01:26:27,140
didn't do it until I was it 10 years ago
or something like that.

1972
01:26:27,141 --> 01:26:27,974
When the,
when the government started paying the 

1973
01:26:29,901 --> 01:26:33,330
NFL to have them do it because it's,
yeah,

1974
01:26:33,331 --> 01:26:34,610
this,
that whole thing.

1975
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:35,660
It's weird,
man.

1976
01:26:35,870 --> 01:26:39,830
It's weird because the whole thing 
you're asking them to be,

1977
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:42,050
you know,
they have to,

1978
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:43,630
to give in,
you know,

1979
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:46,130
that you're,
you're asking them to follow the rule.

1980
01:26:46,650 --> 01:26:47,430
He,
my,

1981
01:26:47,430 --> 01:26:50,750
my problem with it and I called it the 
misdirection.

1982
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:53,390
The protest never had to do with the 
flag.

1983
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:58,550
It was about the protests had to do with
cops and the treatment and it was just,

1984
01:26:58,551 --> 01:26:59,384
he just did it at that point because 
that's a powerful statement to do it at 

1985
01:27:03,321 --> 01:27:04,400
that point,
you know,

1986
01:27:04,401 --> 01:27:05,234
and,
and now the misdirection to changing up 

1987
01:27:08,541 --> 01:27:11,540
the topic is making it about the flag 
and it's like,

1988
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:13,080
no,
that's not what they are.

1989
01:27:13,330 --> 01:27:16,930
They will never protesting the flag or 
veterans or,

1990
01:27:16,931 --> 01:27:18,740
or Americans or and,
and again,

1991
01:27:18,741 --> 01:27:20,870
when you get into those rules of the 
flag,

1992
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:25,490
you're not supposed to have the flag on 
tee shirts or bikinis or hats or,

1993
01:27:25,491 --> 01:27:28,880
or a million other things we sell with 
the flag on it.

1994
01:27:28,881 --> 01:27:30,980
Like if you want to talk about 
respecting the flag,

1995
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:34,520
we wouldn't do any of that.
You summed it up.

1996
01:27:34,521 --> 01:27:36,200
I mean it is,
it's about control,

1997
01:27:36,201 --> 01:27:37,034
right?
It's the same thing with these freedom 

1998
01:27:38,481 --> 01:27:40,230
of speech marches.
Like where?

1999
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:41,383
Yeah,
it's okay to have freedom of speech as 

2000
01:27:42,291 --> 01:27:44,030
long as you're saying something I agree 
with.

2001
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:45,093
Right.
But the problem with this whole 

2002
01:27:46,371 --> 01:27:47,204
kaepernick thing and said it's not an 
effective form of protest too because 

2003
01:27:50,721 --> 01:27:52,760
it's getting people pissed off for the 
wrong reasons.

2004
01:27:52,761 --> 01:27:55,300
Well,
it was people thinking that you're,

2005
01:27:55,301 --> 01:27:56,134
you're protesting America itself,
why don't you move to Canada and then 

2006
01:27:59,561 --> 01:28:00,394
people start getting crazy about it,
but to set what he's trying to do or 

2007
01:28:03,561 --> 01:28:04,394
what he was trying to do was protest all
these unarmed people getting shot by 

2008
01:28:08,061 --> 01:28:10,070
cops and so he takes a need for that.

2009
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:12,650
But the national anthem doesn't have 
shit to do with those cops.

2010
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:13,973
Well,
it just became a thing of when one guy 

2011
01:28:15,471 --> 01:28:19,940
did it and he did it as a protest and he
said he wanted to start the conversation

2012
01:28:20,450 --> 01:28:25,450
and then the conversation got lost and 
now the conversation is completely lost.

2013
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:31,060
Then the argument is a completely 
different topic and you know that.

2014
01:28:31,190 --> 01:28:34,940
But yeah,
what you said control is definitely part

2015
01:28:34,941 --> 01:28:36,470
of it.
Same thing with the universities,

2016
01:28:36,471 --> 01:28:39,080
right?
With free speech on the universities and

2017
01:28:39,081 --> 01:28:41,030
you know when you look at a school like 
Berkeley,

2018
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:43,070
Berkeley had a reasonable arguments like
look,

2019
01:28:43,071 --> 01:28:43,904
when we bring one of these radical 
speakers here and it costs a million 

2020
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:49,610
dollars for security,
who's going to pay that?

2021
01:28:50,230 --> 01:28:52,370
So like we,
if you're going to pay it,

2022
01:28:52,371 --> 01:28:53,450
fine,
we'll let you talk,

2023
01:28:53,451 --> 01:28:54,284
but if nobody's going to pay the million
dollars for security and we can't have 

2024
01:28:57,081 --> 01:28:59,510
these radical speakers here,
sort of,

2025
01:28:59,511 --> 01:29:00,980
you know,
the problem with that article is they've

2026
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:01,913
had those speakers there forever and 
then when they started having these 

2027
01:29:04,921 --> 01:29:08,820
antifa protests and they also start 
supporting these antifa protests,

2028
01:29:08,821 --> 01:29:09,654
that's a big issue.

2029
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:10,593
Well,
they stopped having cops go after the 

2030
01:29:12,031 --> 01:29:12,864
Antifa people and the Berkeley,
the literally the chief of police was 

2031
01:29:15,781 --> 01:29:19,710
literally telling people the mayor was 
telling the police to stand down and let

2032
01:29:19,711 --> 01:29:22,110
these people protest and not just 
protests.

2033
01:29:22,111 --> 01:29:24,090
They were being very violent and 
attacking things.

2034
01:29:24,091 --> 01:29:27,240
And you're setting up a reaction action 
event,

2035
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:29,580
right?
So if you have something like that where

2036
01:29:29,581 --> 01:29:32,490
people are breaking windows and light 
things on fire or doing whatever they're

2037
01:29:32,491 --> 01:29:33,324
doing,
you're going to have people that say 

2038
01:29:34,111 --> 01:29:34,944
fuck,
those people were going to meet there 

2039
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:39,630
and we're going to protest the anti 
protest people.

2040
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:42,230
And then next thing you know you've got 
a real issue in your hand.

2041
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:43,950
But that's the point.
That's,

2042
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:44,903
that's where we're at now,
where everything has to be that big an 

2043
01:29:47,491 --> 01:29:48,900
issue.
You're right.

2044
01:29:48,901 --> 01:29:51,780
Twenty years ago,
10 years ago at Berkeley,

2045
01:29:52,050 --> 01:29:52,883
you could have had a speaker,
a right wing speaker that the school 

2046
01:29:55,781 --> 01:29:56,550
didn't agree with.

2047
01:29:56,550 --> 01:30:00,570
It would have been some protesters 
outside just not even two years ago,

2048
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,460
but then it became,
and this,

2049
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,200
this is a social media effect,
right?

2050
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:05,303
The speaker brings his social media 
thing and he needs to stir it up to 

2051
01:30:09,301 --> 01:30:13,620
build his social media side and then 
some people come and then the other side

2052
01:30:13,650 --> 01:30:14,483
gets mad just what you said,
and they bring their and then you bring 

2053
01:30:17,341 --> 01:30:22,200
the angry groups from both sides are 
going to meet and then they're like,

2054
01:30:22,201 --> 01:30:23,034
okay,
now it's because it makes the whole 

2055
01:30:24,901 --> 01:30:26,520
thing,
but it's like promoting a fight.

2056
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:28,530
You know what I mean?
It's like promoting a fight.

2057
01:30:28,531 --> 01:30:31,170
It's like it's one thing if two guys get
into a fight,

2058
01:30:31,470 --> 01:30:34,320
but if you promote that fight for a 
month,

2059
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:36,150
three months,
six months ahead,

2060
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:39,210
that fight is going to be huge and this 
is the same thing.

2061
01:30:39,211 --> 01:30:40,740
They promote these speakers.

2062
01:30:41,390 --> 01:30:42,223
The,
the,

2063
01:30:43,290 --> 01:30:46,350
the protest is part of the publicity,
right?

2064
01:30:46,770 --> 01:30:47,603
You know,
so well their speakers and then there's 

2065
01:30:48,991 --> 01:30:50,460
people that are provocateurs,
right?

2066
01:30:50,461 --> 01:30:50,910
Like,
you know,

2067
01:30:50,910 --> 01:30:53,010
Milo unit,
that's a better term.

2068
01:30:53,011 --> 01:30:56,220
So I shouldn't say speakers.
I should say provocateurs.

2069
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:57,893
Shapiro is a speaker,
Ben Shapiro's and intellectual and he's 

2070
01:31:00,991 --> 01:31:01,561
a guy.
He's got.

2071
01:31:01,561 --> 01:31:04,110
Some are very solid arguments whether 
you agree with them or not.

2072
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:04,973
He's,
he's got some real facts to go with his 

2073
01:31:06,931 --> 01:31:07,764
arguments and they were,
he's a junior whereas a yarmulke and 

2074
01:31:12,031 --> 01:31:12,864
people calling them a Nazi,
like it's like this whole punch Nazis 

2075
01:31:15,631 --> 01:31:17,960
thing and getting it.
I mean just the,

2076
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:18,823
the arguments are getting so blurry and 
it's just like we were talking about 

2077
01:31:21,001 --> 01:31:22,260
before.
When it comes to gun control,

2078
01:31:22,261 --> 01:31:25,200
it's teams you're on.
I'm on team left wing,

2079
01:31:25,201 --> 01:31:27,080
I support Antifa.
You know,

2080
01:31:27,090 --> 01:31:31,230
I'm on team right wing.
I support the Conservatives and Potus,

2081
01:31:31,470 --> 01:31:33,330
like the people that are calling trump 
potus,

2082
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:34,121
you know,
you know,

2083
01:31:34,121 --> 01:31:35,430
you are defaming potus.

2084
01:31:35,430 --> 01:31:35,821
Like,
Whoa,

2085
01:31:35,821 --> 01:31:36,360
Whoa,
Whoa,

2086
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:37,790
Whoa,
what's fucking trump?

2087
01:31:38,470 --> 01:31:41,220
It's Donald Trump.
If there's ever an argument,

2088
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:42,083
this is ridiculous.
The fucking a guy who was the host of 

2089
01:31:43,771 --> 01:31:47,340
the apprentice is now the guy you're 
calling Joe Joe.

2090
01:31:47,550 --> 01:31:49,410
You're disrespecting the White House 
differences.

2091
01:31:49,550 --> 01:31:50,710
Disrespectful,
potents.

2092
01:31:51,390 --> 01:31:53,160
I mean it's like literally like the 
pope.

2093
01:31:53,350 --> 01:31:55,560
He gets to this almost like paypal 
situation.

2094
01:31:55,561 --> 01:31:56,650
Right.
And again,

2095
01:31:56,940 --> 01:32:01,120
these are the same people who said the 
same thing about Barack Obama.

2096
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:02,073
Yeah.
You know,

2097
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,690
last year.
Right.

2098
01:32:04,050 --> 01:32:09,050
But the president has never been 
disgraced or insulted.

2099
01:32:09,371 --> 01:32:12,760
Like really they insulted when he wore 
tennis shoes.

2100
01:32:13,570 --> 01:32:14,403
We played that when Obama was 10.
So that was the end of America with 

2101
01:32:20,051 --> 01:32:23,260
respect to the office for off color 
clothing.

2102
01:32:23,860 --> 01:32:24,940
It's a gang color.

2103
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:31,940
And then Michelle Obama wore sleeveless 
dress and I think,

2104
01:32:31,970 --> 01:32:33,430
I think that was just,
you know,

2105
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:37,060
didn't Alex Jones do something recently 
saying that Michelle Obama was a man,

2106
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:39,130
like proof that Michelle Obama was a 
man.

2107
01:32:40,690 --> 01:32:42,760
Fuck,
he's on some shit today.

2108
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:44,800
They'll do all that shit with Michelle 
ain't in the room.

2109
01:32:45,250 --> 01:32:47,640
Yeah,
exactly.

2110
01:32:47,641 --> 01:32:48,474
No,
no.

2111
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:51,100
It was easy to put down with trump to 
call pro football players.

2112
01:32:51,101 --> 01:32:53,530
Sons of bitches from Huntsville,
Alabama.

2113
01:32:53,830 --> 01:32:55,630
Yeah.
Let's try it on the sideline.

2114
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:57,340
Right?
A few of them standing next to you,

2115
01:32:57,370 --> 01:32:58,470
sons of bitches.
Yeah,

2116
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:01,030
fire the sons of bitches.
You're fired.

2117
01:33:01,330 --> 01:33:03,760
They shouldn't have them fucking stand 
for the national anthem.

2118
01:33:03,761 --> 01:33:04,594
First of all,
if you want to have a national anthem 

2119
01:33:05,981 --> 01:33:07,870
for a game,
what are you saying?

2120
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:08,441
Are you.
I mean,

2121
01:33:08,441 --> 01:33:09,274
is this.
I mean,

2122
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:09,841
you're,
you're,

2123
01:33:09,841 --> 01:33:13,030
you're rallying up patriotism at a 
sporting event.

2124
01:33:13,150 --> 01:33:15,940
Sporting events are supposed to be 
entertaining.

2125
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:19,120
It's supposed to remove us from all of 
our daily bullshit,

2126
01:33:19,121 --> 01:33:20,620
right?
If it's going to be entertaining,

2127
01:33:20,621 --> 01:33:22,610
be entertaining,
and they did they.

2128
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:24,100
Sorry.
I mean it's okay.

2129
01:33:24,290 --> 01:33:27,100
They did a thing this past week at the 
rams game.

2130
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:30,520
During the national anthem.
How many people were in the beer line?

2131
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:33,280
How many guys were taking a piss?
Oh yeah.

2132
01:33:33,281 --> 01:33:34,360
How many you need?
You know what I mean?

2133
01:33:34,361 --> 01:33:38,010
It's not like those guys not taking.
Everybody stopped anyway.

2134
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:39,670
It's like,
you know,

2135
01:33:39,970 --> 01:33:43,600
not like everybody stopped and turned 
and held their hand over their heart.

2136
01:33:43,601 --> 01:33:43,991
Like,
yeah,

2137
01:33:43,991 --> 01:33:44,824
well I got my Dick in my hand.
Literally literally into the bathroom 

2138
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:50,890
between people's assets for pissing 
during the national anthem.

2139
01:33:50,891 --> 01:33:55,891
If you tell them they can,
it's just the protest is ineffective,

2140
01:33:56,021 --> 01:33:57,340
right?
Getting on your knees,

2141
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:58,233
we.
It just causes too much controversy and 

2142
01:34:00,101 --> 01:34:01,090
here's the other problem with it.

2143
01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:06,040
It doesn't stop anything.
It doesn't stop coc cops or do anything.

2144
01:34:06,041 --> 01:34:06,874
It doesn't even shed light on it.
It just points to you and people start 

2145
01:34:10,541 --> 01:34:11,261
talking about,
well,

2146
01:34:11,261 --> 01:34:13,150
what is it that you're protesting?
Well we're,

2147
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:15,490
we're mad at you because you're not 
standing up for the national anthem.

2148
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:18,470
It creates all this noise.
And again,

2149
01:34:18,950 --> 01:34:19,783
that's the part I called the 
misdirection because initially when 

2150
01:34:22,121 --> 01:34:24,820
Kaepernick did it,
it had some meaning.

2151
01:34:24,821 --> 01:34:25,654
It had some meaning to him and it was 
about starting a conversation and when 

2152
01:34:28,781 --> 01:34:32,440
it became this bigger thing like you're 
talking about when it became this,

2153
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:34,000
Oh,
you're anti American,

2154
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:36,040
your impact troops or blah blah,
blah.

2155
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:38,680
Now it's lost its effectiveness.
Now.

2156
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:39,783
Yeah,
you got to do something else because 

2157
01:34:40,601 --> 01:34:42,010
that doesn't it.
You're right.

2158
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:45,130
It doesn't mean anything anymore.
People don't even know.

2159
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:47,470
They don't even know why you're doing 
it,

2160
01:34:47,471 --> 01:34:50,650
but they hate you for doing it.
Like doing it now too.

2161
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,570
Why are you doing it?
I do it because I hate puppies.

2162
01:34:52,660 --> 01:34:53,530
Yeah,
exactly.

2163
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:57,010
Fuck is everybody's doing it because 
they're mad at trump.

2164
01:34:57,290 --> 01:34:58,123
Shit about the NFL.
So you're getting just giant groups of 

2165
01:34:59,811 --> 01:35:01,790
people doing it now.
Much more so than before.

2166
01:35:01,830 --> 01:35:02,810
Yeah.
And it's,

2167
01:35:02,820 --> 01:35:03,431
yeah,
it's,

2168
01:35:03,431 --> 01:35:04,950
it's lost,
its effectiveness,

2169
01:35:04,951 --> 01:35:06,270
its losses,
importance,

2170
01:35:06,271 --> 01:35:07,890
and you know,
and the players,

2171
01:35:07,891 --> 01:35:09,480
a lot of the players get caught in the 
middle,

2172
01:35:09,481 --> 01:35:10,314
right?
Because if you do have a thing where 

2173
01:35:11,011 --> 01:35:11,844
your team says you can't do it or you're
going to be fined or you're going to 

2174
01:35:14,470 --> 01:35:15,303
whatever.
The NBA said that it's against the 

2175
01:35:18,151 --> 01:35:19,950
rules,
the MBA,

2176
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:20,873
the MBA.
So not anybody doing that in the NBA 

2177
01:35:22,471 --> 01:35:23,590
yet.
Uh,

2178
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:24,533
they,
they,

2179
01:35:24,870 --> 01:35:25,703
well they hadn't started playing.
The NBA just started this week in 

2180
01:35:27,961 --> 01:35:31,130
preseason before it started,
before,

2181
01:35:31,590 --> 01:35:32,423
in the past the NBA did things like they
warn 'em I can't breathe t shirts and 

2182
01:35:39,490 --> 01:35:42,660
they've done things like that.
NBA players,

2183
01:35:42,661 --> 01:35:46,740
NBA players are a bit more sophisticated
and their protests.

2184
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:50,640
And I think there are also a more united
let's head trauma,

2185
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:51,593
you know?
Yeah.

2186
01:35:51,890 --> 01:35:54,950
Probably a big part of it.
They've also been encouraged,

2187
01:35:54,951 --> 01:35:56,150
I think,
to speak out,

2188
01:35:56,300 --> 01:36:00,890
whereas I don't know that the nfl 
players are also encouraged to speak out

2189
01:36:00,891 --> 01:36:02,270
in public.
I don't know if topics,

2190
01:36:02,271 --> 01:36:03,104
I don't know,

2191
01:36:03,130 --> 01:36:03,963
basketball players with necessarily 
encouraged to speak out or the big 

2192
01:36:06,491 --> 01:36:09,550
difference with the NBA,
the players have bigger than the team.

2193
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:11,440
Right,
right,

2194
01:36:11,530 --> 01:36:12,440
right.
They're huge fan.

2195
01:36:12,670 --> 01:36:14,140
Huge stars.
Yeah.

2196
01:36:14,141 --> 01:36:17,080
So you have like Lebron is bigger than 
the cavaliers.

2197
01:36:17,081 --> 01:36:22,060
Curry is bigger than the warriors.
When we did you bomb at the president,

2198
01:36:22,150 --> 01:36:23,680
I was like,
oh my goodness.

2199
01:36:23,681 --> 01:36:26,550
Like where are we?
Where are we going with it?

2200
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:27,613
We're a fucking superstar.
Pro Athlete is tweeting you bomb at the 

2201
01:36:31,241 --> 01:36:34,270
president of the United States who 
happens to be a reality show host.

2202
01:36:35,010 --> 01:36:37,150
Fuck man,
this is good.

2203
01:36:37,350 --> 01:36:38,700
Theoretically,
you know,

2204
01:36:38,701 --> 01:36:39,534
look,
we've elected a reality show host 

2205
01:36:41,310 --> 01:36:43,860
Lebraun could be the president in 20 
years.

2206
01:36:43,930 --> 01:36:46,360
One hundred percent vice president,
Kanye,

2207
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:49,990
vice president,
conduit with the fucking Prozac drip.

2208
01:36:50,170 --> 01:36:52,970
He would have an IV bag drip and right 
into his art.

2209
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,790
My stand there,
like zoning out,

2210
01:36:55,150 --> 01:36:59,830
getting Chubby.
Dashing is shinnecock dash first lady.

2211
01:37:00,150 --> 01:37:01,120
Whoa,
why not?

2212
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:02,440
Why not?
Why the hell?

2213
01:37:02,441 --> 01:37:04,690
Not that Melania can barely speak 
English.

2214
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:08,050
They're talking about immigration.
So closing the border like,

2215
01:37:08,051 --> 01:37:09,430
what the fuck?
Where'd you get her?

2216
01:37:10,330 --> 01:37:11,163
Where'd you get her?
She doesn't speak and she did lesbian 

2217
01:37:13,151 --> 01:37:13,984
porn.

2218
01:37:14,110 --> 01:37:15,590
I don't watch out.
Oh,

2219
01:37:15,591 --> 01:37:16,424
watch bill Maher all the time.
But apparently he did this sub kind of 

2220
01:37:18,770 --> 01:37:23,110
top 10 list about Melania and if one of 
the jokes was she has no

2221
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:28,160
first language.
Yeah,

2222
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:31,240
that's a joke that Russell Peters said 
about Yoshi,

2223
01:37:31,890 --> 01:37:34,080
Yoshi Kobiashi Shit.
He was saying.

2224
01:37:34,081 --> 01:37:34,740
He goes,
ah,

2225
01:37:34,740 --> 01:37:36,420
he goes,
Yoshi speaks terrible English.

2226
01:37:36,421 --> 01:37:39,630
But when you talk to people that speak 
Japanese is Japanese sucks too.

2227
01:37:40,030 --> 01:37:44,550
It's like you have no real language.
Yeah,

2228
01:37:44,730 --> 01:37:49,260
it's the whole thing is,
is this football thing is very strange.

2229
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:50,153
It's very strange because now they're,
they kicked these two high school kids 

2230
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:56,880
right off the team because they're 
following their heroes.

2231
01:37:57,130 --> 01:37:57,931
So they say,
fuck it,

2232
01:37:57,931 --> 01:38:00,120
I'm going to take a knee to.
First of all,

2233
01:38:00,150 --> 01:38:00,983
you'd taken a knee.
You should at least be able to write an 

2234
01:38:02,371 --> 01:38:05,150
essay.
Tell me why you're taking a nice son.

2235
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:06,233
You know,
and you got to know the difference 

2236
01:38:06,901 --> 01:38:07,734
between Your y o u r and while you 
apostrophe r e and you also got to be 

2237
01:38:13,441 --> 01:38:15,000
starting.
Yes.

2238
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:15,710
You know what I mean?

2239
01:38:15,710 --> 01:38:18,330
Like,
like if the starting quarterback takes a

2240
01:38:18,331 --> 01:38:21,780
knee,
he does a lot more latitude than,

2241
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:24,330
you know,
a second string defensive end.

2242
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:25,590
You know what I mean?
Like,

2243
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:27,710
you know,
if trust me,

2244
01:38:27,711 --> 01:38:28,400
if,
if,

2245
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:29,640
uh,
you know,

2246
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:32,790
Aaron Rodgers,
if Dak Prescott was taken a knee,

2247
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,970
this be a whole different conversation.
What?

2248
01:38:35,670 --> 01:38:38,250
Kaepernick wasn't a big star player.
He was,

2249
01:38:38,251 --> 01:38:39,084
but he fell off.
He fell off because of the controversy 

2250
01:38:41,701 --> 01:38:44,070
and all the halo.
I don't know what it was he,

2251
01:38:44,370 --> 01:38:45,203
he had,
he had started falling off before that 

2252
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:49,590
so that we know what it was.
I,

2253
01:38:49,591 --> 01:38:50,940
yeah.
I don't know what I mean.

2254
01:38:50,941 --> 01:38:53,160
But one of the arguments is in,
it is true.

2255
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:56,880
He's a lot better than a lot of 
quarterbacks who have jobs.

2256
01:38:57,220 --> 01:38:59,730
See that was the thing.
They said no,

2257
01:38:59,731 --> 01:39:02,040
it's not a conspiracy because of the 
protests.

2258
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:03,083
But then they showed the numbers of like
various backup quarterbacks who were in 

2259
01:39:06,631 --> 01:39:10,620
the league and he's better than a lot of
them and in one of the owners,

2260
01:39:10,621 --> 01:39:14,160
I think it was Baltimore where the coach
wanted him and the owner was like,

2261
01:39:14,161 --> 01:39:15,960
Nah,
I don't want him because of the protest.

2262
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:17,093
So it became a thing of where they said,
they said he's not blackballed because 

2263
01:39:20,581 --> 01:39:22,440
of the protest,
but then it came out.

2264
01:39:22,441 --> 01:39:23,274
Yeah,
he was blackballed because of the 

2265
01:39:24,271 --> 01:39:25,104
protest.
And again that that's one of those 

2266
01:39:26,791 --> 01:39:29,760
things where,
and you know this with any athlete,

2267
01:39:29,761 --> 01:39:33,270
like your complaints depend on where you
are in your career.

2268
01:39:33,271 --> 01:39:34,104
Sure.
Tom Brady even said the president was 

2269
01:39:36,151 --> 01:39:38,880
divisive and when Tom Brady said that 
everybody went,

2270
01:39:38,881 --> 01:39:40,020
oh Jesus.
Right,

2271
01:39:40,340 --> 01:39:41,510
right.
It's not taking the knee yet,

2272
01:39:41,511 --> 01:39:42,690
but they're,
they're hooking arms.

2273
01:39:42,691 --> 01:39:43,524
Yeah.
Yeah.

2274
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:47,910
Everybody's arms in unity.
Because when trump spoke out against the

2275
01:39:47,911 --> 01:39:48,870
nfl,
now he,

2276
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:50,770
he's aiming at their money.
Yeah.

2277
01:39:50,771 --> 01:39:51,604
You know,
when he's telling fans not to go to the 

2278
01:39:52,891 --> 01:39:55,200
games,
like those owners love him,

2279
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:56,490
but now they're like,
whoa,

2280
01:39:56,491 --> 01:39:58,030
hold the fuck up now.
Yeah.

2281
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:58,913
That's money out of our pocket.
Everybody saying hold the fuck up now 

2282
01:40:01,201 --> 01:40:02,310
because it is working.

2283
01:40:02,370 --> 01:40:03,203
Direct TV just offered this gigantic 
refund for their nfl package because 

2284
01:40:07,741 --> 01:40:09,630
people are pissed off that people are 
taking a knee.

2285
01:40:09,810 --> 01:40:12,740
You're paying to see football.
You fucks.

2286
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:15,390
You're not paying to see people stand 
with their hand over their heart.

2287
01:40:15,391 --> 01:40:18,000
Like what?
Here's the here's the solution.

2288
01:40:18,210 --> 01:40:19,043
Take all that shit out of the game.
If you want the players to be compliant 

2289
01:40:23,010 --> 01:40:26,580
and submissive when you're.
You're asking the wrong thing.

2290
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:27,653
You're talking about super athletes is a
what is essentially a group combat 

2291
01:40:31,111 --> 01:40:32,490
sport.
That's a football.

2292
01:40:32,491 --> 01:40:33,440
Yes.
Okay,

2293
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:35,710
and if they're not,
I mean,

2294
01:40:35,730 --> 01:40:36,900
what are you doing here?
You're.

2295
01:40:36,901 --> 01:40:37,734
You're telling them to keep their job.
They have to put their hand over their 

2296
01:40:40,681 --> 01:40:42,300
heart and standards.
Certain position.

2297
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:43,313
That seems very fucking bizarre.
Fox Fox said that they're going to stop 

2298
01:40:46,470 --> 01:40:49,830
televising the national anthem and it 
was pointed out.

2299
01:40:49,950 --> 01:40:52,580
Well you didn't use to televise the 
national anthem like you.

2300
01:40:52,590 --> 01:40:54,130
You didn't tell buys it until two

2301
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:54,963
weeks ago when it became controversial.
Before that you will be listening to 

2302
01:40:57,911 --> 01:41:01,100
those three guys in the studio right up 
til the kickoff.

2303
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:04,750
You and then the only time they televise
it it if it was like Whitney Houston was

2304
01:41:04,751 --> 01:41:08,120
singing it where it was.
That was a big deal.

2305
01:41:08,170 --> 01:41:08,570
So.

2306
01:41:08,570 --> 01:41:09,403
Well,
I'm a big fan of no anthem in sports 

2307
01:41:13,341 --> 01:41:14,174
because I like sports to be split.
Like one of the things I love about the 

2308
01:41:16,821 --> 01:41:19,220
UFC,
so there's no national anthems you don't

2309
01:41:19,221 --> 01:41:22,460
have to play.
Do they often say the Brazilian national

2310
01:41:22,461 --> 01:41:23,294
anthem when Josie,
all those fighting or the American 

2311
01:41:25,071 --> 01:41:27,100
national anthem.
When Chris Weidman's fighting,

2312
01:41:27,110 --> 01:41:30,290
you don't have to do that.
They just go right to the fight.

2313
01:41:30,291 --> 01:41:32,330
Here's the main event of the evening,
boom,

2314
01:41:32,540 --> 01:41:33,620
entertainment,
blah,

2315
01:41:33,621 --> 01:41:34,454
blah blah,
and if someone wants to make some sort 

2316
01:41:37,281 --> 01:41:40,940
of a political statement or stand,
they can do that in an interview.

2317
01:41:41,690 --> 01:41:45,710
That interview will be judged based on 
the content of whatever the conversation

2318
01:41:45,711 --> 01:41:46,544
is and that's how it should be.
This weird sort of way where someone 

2319
01:41:49,641 --> 01:41:54,290
taking a knee is supposed to protest 
cops shooting people,

2320
01:41:54,291 --> 01:41:56,360
but it doesn't say that while you're 
taking the knee,

2321
01:41:56,361 --> 01:42:00,140
you're taking a knee during the anthem.
The anthem is supposed to be all of us.

2322
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:05,030
It's supposed to be America,
but then again as a team like the United

2323
01:42:05,030 --> 01:42:07,700
States of America,
not the seahawks versus the dolphins.

2324
01:42:07,970 --> 01:42:10,700
Put all that aside for a second.
We're all in this together.

2325
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:11,593
That's the idea.

2326
01:42:11,650 --> 01:42:15,140
I understand why he did it and I 
understand why he did it then because it

2327
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:19,420
was the way to call attention to it,
but now that's lost.

2328
01:42:19,421 --> 01:42:22,000
But you know what the national anthem 
has been historically.

2329
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,950
Get to your seat.
The game's about to start [inaudible].

2330
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:26,100
That's all it was.
Yeah.

2331
01:42:26,110 --> 01:42:26,943
It was like the to the.
What's the last word in the last two 

2332
01:42:30,071 --> 01:42:33,790
words are the national anthem play ball.
Like that's literally,

2333
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:34,953
that's what we thought was part of the 
song because that's what you heard 

2334
01:42:36,821 --> 01:42:37,600
right?
At the end,

2335
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:39,820
the empire Yo play ball and the game 
starts,

2336
01:42:40,030 --> 01:42:42,760
you know,
so I understood what captain nick did,

2337
01:42:42,761 --> 01:42:43,594
but now it's done.
And now it's been compromised and 

2338
01:42:47,261 --> 01:42:51,190
changed and the arguments changed and,
and yeah,

2339
01:42:51,220 --> 01:42:52,690
it's,
you know,

2340
01:42:52,810 --> 01:42:56,140
and he's still not playing.
People are using the land of the free to

2341
01:42:56,141 --> 01:42:57,800
shake there dick as they like.

2342
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:06,720
What is this just came out now,
uh,

2343
01:43:06,860 --> 01:43:07,693
this afternoon,
maybe even within the hour that 1200 

2344
01:43:10,241 --> 01:43:11,074
players,
personal data has been exposed and 

2345
01:43:12,311 --> 01:43:15,340
eleague by hackers nfl,
including Colin Kaepernick's data.

2346
01:43:15,550 --> 01:43:16,860
What kind of data,
uh,

2347
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:19,690
personal information off of a server 
from the NFL,

2348
01:43:19,691 --> 01:43:23,680
PA is associated with that.
How was that a hack there?

2349
01:43:23,690 --> 01:43:27,000
Or did they just have experience equifax
or whatever.

2350
01:43:28,510 --> 01:43:31,060
So they had a bitcoin ransom.
They were trying to say they would,

2351
01:43:31,370 --> 01:43:35,020
uh,
get rid of this leak.

2352
01:43:35,021 --> 01:43:35,640
But,
uh,

2353
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:40,640
it is now coming out only 428 bucks at 
the time.

2354
01:43:40,930 --> 01:43:42,550
How crazy is that though?
Give you 400,

2355
01:43:42,551 --> 01:43:43,384
28 bucks.
I know someone that happened up to that 

2356
01:43:44,901 --> 01:43:46,870
bitcoin has really?
Yeah.

2357
01:43:46,871 --> 01:43:48,950
Yeah.
I was just talking to her this weekend.

2358
01:43:48,951 --> 01:43:53,951
She has an accounting company and 
apparently these hackers take control of

2359
01:43:54,411 --> 01:43:55,244
your database and they have an 
encryption key and you have to pay them 

2360
01:43:59,781 --> 01:44:04,190
in Bitcoin to get the encryption key to 
get back your own data.

2361
01:44:05,340 --> 01:44:10,340
Giant group of people from other 
countries that engage in this and they,

2362
01:44:10,551 --> 01:44:13,950
they target large businesses and people 
that will be willing to pay.

2363
01:44:14,030 --> 01:44:16,160
Yeah,
I'd like an extortion thing.

2364
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:17,360
Yeah.
Very weird.

2365
01:44:17,690 --> 01:44:19,460
So you know,
you have something to lose.

2366
01:44:19,770 --> 01:44:20,603
You know me.
If you want to hold my full 128 

2367
01:44:23,121 --> 01:44:25,160
followers hostage.
Go ahead.

2368
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:28,303
I'll just start another website.
You think Colin Kaepernick gets 

2369
01:44:31,151 --> 01:44:34,660
confronted by the suits?
Do you think they sit him down and go,

2370
01:44:34,661 --> 01:44:36,430
hey man,
you gotta stop doing this.

2371
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:37,870
This is fucking up.
Everybody in.

2372
01:44:38,220 --> 01:44:41,240
I think they did last year.
What do you think they did last year?

2373
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:42,093
Where do you think this goes?
I guess my question is like when the 

2374
01:44:44,831 --> 01:44:47,050
more trump tweets about this ratings 
down,

2375
01:44:47,110 --> 01:44:48,430
Ella Nfl,
bad,

2376
01:44:48,490 --> 01:44:49,620
sad,
you know,

2377
01:44:49,630 --> 01:44:50,463
he tweets that and all the trumpets go 
along with it and then they start 

2378
01:44:53,530 --> 01:44:54,570
boycotting.
People are.

2379
01:44:54,571 --> 01:44:55,404
I see all these fucking tweets,
boycott the NFL and all this crazy 

2380
01:44:58,811 --> 01:44:59,600
thing,

2381
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:00,500
you know,
where it goes,

2382
01:45:00,590 --> 01:45:03,740
it goes nowhere because we have no 
attention span is a nation,

2383
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:07,400
but it's going to have to stop or 
continue.

2384
01:45:07,430 --> 01:45:08,570
But again,
this is the thing,

2385
01:45:08,571 --> 01:45:09,404
we,
we just had this mass shooting so the 

2386
01:45:12,021 --> 01:45:16,340
attention now will be on,
on the NRA and you know,

2387
01:45:16,341 --> 01:45:17,680
guns and,
and so,

2388
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:18,553
you know what I mean?
And the NFL will be on the back burner 

2389
01:45:20,450 --> 01:45:25,100
like we have you in the past month,
six weeks.

2390
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,080
Confederate statues,
right?

2391
01:45:28,340 --> 01:45:29,660
Yeah.
Hurricanes,

2392
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:31,430
Charlotesville.
Uh,

2393
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:32,240
yeah.
Uh,

2394
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:35,240
the NFL,
now it's a mass shooting,

2395
01:45:35,241 --> 01:45:36,680
you know what I mean?
We have no,

2396
01:45:36,710 --> 01:45:41,180
we have no attention span as a nation,
so it will just go away and,

2397
01:45:41,181 --> 01:45:44,840
and in another month people will be 
watching football.

2398
01:45:44,870 --> 01:45:46,370
There'll be something else.
Yeah.

2399
01:45:46,460 --> 01:45:47,630
Yeah.
Because there's always,

2400
01:45:47,930 --> 01:45:51,680
there's always the latest big story.
And then that still,

2401
01:45:51,681 --> 01:45:52,514
you know,
I haven't heard a thing about a 

2402
01:45:54,081 --> 01:45:58,280
confederate statue in the last two weeks
with him getting knocked down,

2403
01:45:58,281 --> 01:46:00,440
have them getting put back up or 
whatever.

2404
01:46:00,441 --> 01:46:02,540
You know what I mean?
It's so true,

2405
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:04,970
right.
Wrong or indifferent,

2406
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:08,030
America has zero attention span.

2407
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:09,493
Yeah.
Did you see what that fucking lady from 

2408
01:46:11,351 --> 01:46:13,300
CBS,
that top executive,

2409
01:46:13,301 --> 01:46:17,560
she was like a vice president at cvs,
some huge position.

2410
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:21,640
She went on facebook saying she didn't 
feel bad for the people that got shot in

2411
01:46:21,641 --> 01:46:25,660
Vegas because they were Republicans.
They were likely Republicans.

2412
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:27,213
She's talking about hundreds of people 
that got shot for going to a country 

2413
01:46:31,661 --> 01:46:32,494
music concert.
Like the fact that she just made this 

2414
01:46:34,751 --> 01:46:38,320
blanket statement.
She thought they were likely Republicans

2415
01:46:38,470 --> 01:46:40,480
because they were at a country music 
concert.

2416
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:41,413
You know the thing about that this,
and this is the thing about freedom of 

2417
01:46:43,911 --> 01:46:47,330
speech that people forget you have 
freedom of speech,

2418
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:49,230
but there's consequences,
right?

2419
01:46:49,350 --> 01:46:51,630
It's not freedom of speech without 
consequence.

2420
01:46:51,870 --> 01:46:56,220
So she can say that and then if CBS 
fires her the next day,

2421
01:46:56,700 --> 01:46:57,331
it's like,
well,

2422
01:46:57,331 --> 01:46:59,490
you shouldn't have said that shit.
You know you represent.

2423
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:00,333
Should've kept it to yourself or you 
should have told your friends at the 

2424
01:47:03,211 --> 01:47:04,044
cocktail party,
but the minute you made that public 

2425
01:47:05,551 --> 01:47:08,730
statement,
we don't want to be associated with you,

2426
01:47:08,940 --> 01:47:10,260
but it's what we're talking about 
earlier,

2427
01:47:10,261 --> 01:47:15,261
this team thing that someone could be so
ideologically isolated,

2428
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:16,733
they're so locked into this liberal 
bubble that they think it's okay to say 

2429
01:47:20,821 --> 01:47:21,654
something like that,
that it's okay for mass murder to exist 

2430
01:47:25,290 --> 01:47:26,123
and you don't feel bad for those massive
because you don't agree with them 

2431
01:47:29,041 --> 01:47:32,410
politically or your team ideology.
I mean,

2432
01:47:32,490 --> 01:47:33,840
what did you.
Is that.

2433
01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:35,430
What is her name?
This lady.

2434
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:40,170
It's fucking insane.
This level.

2435
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:44,880
She was a very high level executive.
This isn't like some new sentences was.

2436
01:47:44,881 --> 01:47:45,470
Yeah,
almost.

2437
01:47:45,470 --> 01:47:46,870
She's fuck now.
I mean,

2438
01:47:46,890 --> 01:47:48,960
she's likely fucked forever.
I mean,

2439
01:47:48,961 --> 01:47:50,580
this is not something that people 
forget.

2440
01:47:50,850 --> 01:47:51,683
What did.
She was a vice president of business 

2441
01:47:52,861 --> 01:47:53,700
affairs.
Oh No,

2442
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:54,571
they.
Yeah,

2443
01:47:54,571 --> 01:47:58,320
the vice president of business affairs.
Yeah.

2444
01:47:58,321 --> 01:48:01,140
Hailey gift them and gold wrote on her 
facebook page.

2445
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:01,974
She was not sympathetic to victims of 
shootings because she claimed most 

2446
01:48:04,381 --> 01:48:05,200
country music fans.

2447
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:06,390
Republicans.
Wow.

2448
01:48:06,570 --> 01:48:07,403
She wrote that.
If they wouldn't do anything when 

2449
01:48:09,061 --> 01:48:09,894
children were murdered,
I have no hope that repugnant will ever 

2450
01:48:12,901 --> 01:48:13,734
do the right thing.
I'm actually not even sympathetic 

2451
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:20,580
because country music fans are often a 
republican gun toters.

2452
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:21,473
Holy Shit.
You got the right to say it and you've 

2453
01:48:22,761 --> 01:48:26,420
got the right to lose your job.
Not sympathetic is such A.

2454
01:48:26,540 --> 01:48:30,750
I mean that could have been your sister,
your mom,

2455
01:48:30,810 --> 01:48:32,460
your mom,
your daughter,

2456
01:48:32,850 --> 01:48:36,960
someone's little kid.
I mean that was a country music thing,

2457
01:48:36,961 --> 01:48:37,794
right?
It was a lot of family type folks that 

2458
01:48:40,381 --> 01:48:42,150
are there.
Country Music events.

2459
01:48:42,151 --> 01:48:42,984
Man.
I don't know what time of night that it 

2460
01:48:43,621 --> 01:48:45,300
all went down,
but how old are you?

2461
01:48:45,910 --> 01:48:48,800
10 tall kid in one of those videos.
Yeah,

2462
01:48:48,820 --> 01:48:49,381
I mean,
sure,

2463
01:48:49,381 --> 01:48:51,940
there's,
there's music things that.

2464
01:48:52,090 --> 01:48:53,550
What I,
what I said was,

2465
01:48:53,610 --> 01:48:56,550
had it been a rap concert,
they would have blamed the artists.

2466
01:48:57,930 --> 01:48:58,763
Not if a white guy did it,
they would have been some serious calls 

2467
01:49:00,961 --> 01:49:02,730
of,
of horrific racism.

2468
01:49:02,731 --> 01:49:05,040
It's just lucky that a white guy was 
shooting white people,

2469
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:06,960
you know,
because then again,

2470
01:49:07,370 --> 01:49:10,530
you know,
it's the reason I laugh because like,

2471
01:49:10,680 --> 01:49:13,320
that's how horrific we become as a 
society,

2472
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:15,360
that that's the statement.
Like,

2473
01:49:15,410 --> 01:49:16,350
you know,
you know what I mean?

2474
01:49:16,351 --> 01:49:17,184
Like yeah,
we'll lose a white guy shooting white 

2475
01:49:18,271 --> 01:49:20,760
people.
So we couldn't twist the race into it,

2476
01:49:20,761 --> 01:49:21,650
you know,
you know what I mean?

2477
01:49:21,660 --> 01:49:24,720
Like today about someone was writing 
about white privilege,

2478
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:25,431
right?
We're,

2479
01:49:25,431 --> 01:49:26,460
we're.
So,

2480
01:49:27,860 --> 01:49:29,590
we're insane.
We're insane that,

2481
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:30,091
that,
that,

2482
01:49:30,091 --> 01:49:33,630
that is the issue with something like 
this,

2483
01:49:33,690 --> 01:49:34,440
you know,
but,

2484
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:35,460
but it's,
it's true.

2485
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:39,720
I mean what you're saying is true,
but we've reached that level of insanity

2486
01:49:39,721 --> 01:49:41,190
that,
that statement is true.

2487
01:49:41,340 --> 01:49:46,120
Can Imagine how freaked out people would
be if that was a Muslim that did this.

2488
01:49:46,210 --> 01:49:46,740
Oh,

2489
01:49:46,740 --> 01:49:48,550
okay.
It'd be war.

2490
01:49:48,690 --> 01:49:51,580
What would be war war?
It will be war in the streets.

2491
01:49:52,210 --> 01:49:53,360
And,
and you know,

2492
01:49:53,590 --> 01:49:56,470
actually like no Muslim would be safe in
America.

2493
01:49:56,770 --> 01:49:57,603
I mean is,
are we going to have war on white dudes 

2494
01:50:00,011 --> 01:50:01,090
with guns?
No,

2495
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:04,000
no.
I mean there was white dudes with guns.

2496
01:50:04,001 --> 01:50:06,910
They got shot by white dude with guns.
Everyone must feel so,

2497
01:50:06,970 --> 01:50:10,750
so conflicted because a lot of those 
people that were in the audience,

2498
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:11,913
like one of the country music guys 
actually came out and said that he 

2499
01:50:14,081 --> 01:50:16,990
completely switched his stance on gun 
rights.

2500
01:50:16,991 --> 01:50:19,840
He said,
I've been a second amendment advocate my

2501
01:50:19,841 --> 01:50:21,100
entire life.
He goes,

2502
01:50:21,101 --> 01:50:23,700
I have concealed carry permits.
Uh,

2503
01:50:24,130 --> 01:50:27,370
there's people that were concealed carry
permits that were all my staff.

2504
01:50:27,820 --> 01:50:28,720
Yeah.
Guitarists.

2505
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:30,850
Las Vegas controlled,
changed his mind and gun control.

2506
01:50:31,210 --> 01:50:34,200
What is his name?
Caleb keeter.

2507
01:50:34,870 --> 01:50:37,030
Caleb keeter.
Sounds like the widest fucking do that's

2508
01:50:37,031 --> 01:50:37,580
ever lived.

2509
01:50:37,580 --> 01:50:38,850
Caleb,
good old boy.

2510
01:50:39,260 --> 01:50:40,630
My Caleb,
Caleb,

2511
01:50:40,670 --> 01:50:41,503
Katie.
I'm going to go out on a limb here and 

2512
01:50:42,341 --> 01:50:44,260
say Caleb cute drives the truck.
Oh,

2513
01:50:44,261 --> 01:50:45,094
for sure.
You have a basketball or a baseball hat 

2514
01:50:48,311 --> 01:50:53,311
or a cowboy hat leveled 95 wizard 
guitarist for the.

2515
01:50:54,340 --> 01:50:59,340
What does that Josh Abbott Band see?
I'll say something like that.

2516
01:51:00,011 --> 01:51:00,844
I'm like,
who the fuck are they?

2517
01:51:00,970 --> 01:51:03,970
And then you go to their twitter page.
They have $24 million followers.

2518
01:51:03,971 --> 01:51:05,220
I'm like,
what is happening?

2519
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:06,513
I don't understand.
Country Music is a whole different 

2520
01:51:08,321 --> 01:51:09,490
world,
different world,

2521
01:51:10,060 --> 01:51:13,480
but again,
we're getting back to where we started,

2522
01:51:13,481 --> 01:51:17,470
which is great and the insanity of of 
the whole thing,

2523
01:51:17,471 --> 01:51:18,304
but the problem,
what you said about like a white guy 

2524
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:22,293
doing this shooting,
we were talking about everyone's in 

2525
01:51:24,461 --> 01:51:25,211
their team,
right?

2526
01:51:25,211 --> 01:51:28,510
Everyone's in their group,
but this ruins the narrative,

2527
01:51:28,570 --> 01:51:29,403
right?
Because if our narrative is the Muslims 

2528
01:51:31,660 --> 01:51:33,460
are terrorists,
they write today,

2529
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:34,353
they are the terrorists and the black 
people are criminals and the Mexicans 

2530
01:51:37,841 --> 01:51:39,960
are rapists and dope dealers and 
everything.

2531
01:51:40,180 --> 01:51:41,440
Then,
Oh shit,

2532
01:51:41,441 --> 01:51:44,170
one of ours did it to us.
A millionaire.

2533
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:48,340
Yeah.
A white millionaire real estate investor

2534
01:51:48,430 --> 01:51:50,350
and a gambler.
This,

2535
01:51:50,351 --> 01:51:52,740
this ruins your narrative.
Now you have to.

2536
01:51:52,990 --> 01:51:57,520
Now you have to figure out how to change
your story to make him other.

2537
01:51:57,550 --> 01:51:58,383
Because he has to somehow become other.
There are people that are taken 

2538
01:52:01,361 --> 01:52:05,110
advantage of it.
I saw this article on white privilege.

2539
01:52:05,410 --> 01:52:06,243
They're saying that the shooter had 
white privilege and using his white 

2540
01:52:09,011 --> 01:52:09,844
privilege.
That's how he walked through the casino 

2541
01:52:11,531 --> 01:52:14,350
with all these guns and all this 
equipment and shit like that.

2542
01:52:14,351 --> 01:52:16,820
I'm like,
what is a psychopath?

2543
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:20,260
I believe white privilege exists in 
certain circumstances.

2544
01:52:20,261 --> 01:52:21,610
Not In that one.
Yeah.

2545
01:52:21,611 --> 01:52:24,130
That's a ridiculous argument.
What are we looking at,

2546
01:52:24,700 --> 01:52:25,510
Jamie?
Oh,

2547
01:52:25,510 --> 01:52:28,390
white privilege of the loan.
Roofshoot all that fucking guy.

2548
01:52:28,630 --> 01:52:31,300
Of course.
That fucking fake black guy.

2549
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:34,730
This of course it's Tim who writes that 
that guy is such a race.

2550
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:35,793
Oh,
you talking about the article about the 

2551
01:52:36,731 --> 01:52:38,280
guy being a lone wolf?
Yeah,

2552
01:52:38,350 --> 01:52:39,520
yeah,
yeah.

2553
01:52:39,521 --> 01:52:42,820
I read that.
This whole thing that we're dealing with

2554
01:52:42,821 --> 01:52:45,980
as so many different facets to it,
the mass shooter

2555
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:48,590
thing,
but a big part of it is the fact that it

2556
01:52:48,591 --> 01:52:50,630
become the narrative for the entire 
country.

2557
01:52:50,910 --> 01:52:53,930
It becomes a huge part of what 
everybody's talking about.

2558
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:57,050
These people that have,
for whatever reason,

2559
01:52:57,051 --> 01:53:02,051
they have this need to be a guy who gets
paid attention to this.

2560
01:53:02,980 --> 01:53:07,980
This gets back to your point about 
mental health and our mental health as a

2561
01:53:08,661 --> 01:53:11,240
nation.
That the mass shooter is a thing,

2562
01:53:11,410 --> 01:53:12,360
you know,
like,

2563
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:13,310
you know,
um,

2564
01:53:13,310 --> 01:53:14,143
I think it was trevor Noah was talking 
about on the daily show where we're 

2565
01:53:18,201 --> 01:53:20,830
really not surprised anymore because 
he's,

2566
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:24,320
he said he's been in the United States 
for two years living in New York for two

2567
01:53:24,321 --> 01:53:27,530
years and how many mass shootings is and
it's like,

2568
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:29,450
but Americans are like,
yeah,

2569
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:31,640
you know,
another one.

2570
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:33,260
And we,
we,

2571
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:37,760
we got to develop some sense of outrage 
before we do something about this.

2572
01:53:37,970 --> 01:53:41,180
Or like the onion article was talking 
about we just like,

2573
01:53:41,181 --> 01:53:42,014
well,
we'll just hope that it doesn't happen 

2574
01:53:43,251 --> 01:53:43,910
again.

2575
01:53:43,910 --> 01:53:45,500
We won't do anything differently,
right?

2576
01:53:45,530 --> 01:53:47,270
We're not going to do anything 
different,

2577
01:53:47,271 --> 01:53:48,710
but we're just going to hope,
you know,

2578
01:53:49,070 --> 01:53:51,020
and that,
and that line.

2579
01:53:51,420 --> 01:53:54,800
The thoughts and prayers line.
Stop it,

2580
01:53:54,830 --> 01:53:56,180
stop it,
stop it.

2581
01:53:56,210 --> 01:54:01,100
Your thoughts and prayers go out to no,
you need to say something.

2582
01:54:01,190 --> 01:54:02,410
Right?
And,

2583
01:54:02,411 --> 01:54:04,400
and people do.
But if you're,

2584
01:54:04,460 --> 01:54:05,293
if you're in the government,
if you're a policy maker than you do 

2585
01:54:08,001 --> 01:54:10,220
more than just say that you gotta you 
gotTa,

2586
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:11,213
you know,
put your balls on the line and step up 

2587
01:54:13,041 --> 01:54:13,874
and do something challenged.
Challenge the gun lobby about 

2588
01:54:17,001 --> 01:54:17,834
registration of weapons.
It was easier for them to challenge the 

2589
01:54:21,141 --> 01:54:25,130
hotel lobby about security and hotels 
than the challenge.

2590
01:54:25,131 --> 01:54:29,810
The gun lobby about registration or 
weapon registration of weapons.

2591
01:54:29,811 --> 01:54:31,610
This guy had these weapons illegally.
I mean,

2592
01:54:31,611 --> 01:54:33,710
these are still,
at the end of the day,

2593
01:54:33,770 --> 01:54:36,500
you're talking about criminal possessing
criminal weapons.

2594
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:37,610
Same thing.
Sandy Hook,

2595
01:54:37,780 --> 01:54:40,640
he got hooked.
He got them from his mom.

2596
01:54:40,910 --> 01:54:42,200
Got Him legally.
Right?

2597
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:45,350
But he got it.
But you can still make it,

2598
01:54:45,351 --> 01:54:47,510
like you said,
if you made it more difficult.

2599
01:54:47,511 --> 01:54:50,930
If you had to take a class,
if you had to register,

2600
01:54:50,931 --> 01:54:54,530
if you had to be a percentage,
there'd be a percentage that didn't,

2601
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:55,633
didn't have.
Um,

2602
01:54:55,730 --> 01:54:57,590
yeah.
I mean your shit should be locked up.

2603
01:54:57,860 --> 01:54:58,760
I mean,
it's just.

2604
01:54:58,910 --> 01:55:02,540
I just don't know.
But what's interesting too is that trump

2605
01:55:02,541 --> 01:55:03,374
used to be a democrat.
A Democrat forever trumps a publicity 

2606
01:55:06,771 --> 01:55:08,300
guy.
And you know what I mean?

2607
01:55:08,301 --> 01:55:09,020
And,
and he,

2608
01:55:09,020 --> 01:55:09,740
you know,
this is,

2609
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:12,440
this goes back to Sarah Pailin,
right?

2610
01:55:12,441 --> 01:55:16,340
Like I never liked Sarah Palin or agreed
with Sarah Pailin,

2611
01:55:16,550 --> 01:55:19,790
but I respected Sarah Pailin,
his ability to manipulate the media.

2612
01:55:20,030 --> 01:55:22,880
Sarah Pailin knew how to keep her name 
in the news,

2613
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:23,910
you know,
uh,

2614
01:55:23,910 --> 01:55:25,820
you know,
Kim Kardashians and other one,

2615
01:55:25,821 --> 01:55:28,100
like you may not like Kim Kardashian,
but guess what,

2616
01:55:28,250 --> 01:55:31,340
you know who she is,
you know who she is.

2617
01:55:31,370 --> 01:55:32,203
We all know who she is.
I read somewhere that she is the most 

2618
01:55:34,401 --> 01:55:37,430
famous woman on earth and I can believe 
that.

2619
01:55:37,490 --> 01:55:38,323
And I had a whole bit about how the 
whole bit about aliens come down here 

2620
01:55:41,211 --> 01:55:43,860
and try to figure out why that's the 
most woman on earth.

2621
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:45,053
And we explained to her by using Oj 
Simpson at the whole idea is that Oj 

2622
01:55:49,140 --> 01:55:49,973
Simpson,
you know,

2623
01:55:50,130 --> 01:55:53,610
got out of the Robert Kardashian was Oj 
Simpson.

2624
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:56,250
One of his attorneys.
They all died of cancer.

2625
01:55:56,690 --> 01:55:57,840
Yeah,
that's what's fucked up.

2626
01:55:57,870 --> 01:55:58,703
Yeah.
Athlete Bailey's the only guy that's 

2627
01:55:59,791 --> 01:56:03,060
alive and he's broke and living in Maine
somewhere.

2628
01:56:03,570 --> 01:56:04,403
Everybody that got Oj off it just 
ostracized and Johnnie Cochran died of 

2629
01:56:07,621 --> 01:56:10,500
cancer and died of cancer and they all 
just stop.

2630
01:56:10,501 --> 01:56:11,334
Fuck hitting team their way.
A lot of the brothers in jail because 

2631
01:56:14,791 --> 01:56:17,410
Johnny Cochran died.
Joe,

2632
01:56:18,150 --> 01:56:20,630
I ain't gonna lie to you Joe.
We Miss Johnny.

2633
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:25,230
He fucked up with doj was good.
The glove does not fit.

2634
01:56:25,231 --> 01:56:27,090
You must acquit.
And everybody was like,

2635
01:56:27,180 --> 01:56:30,510
why is a lot of ball players doing time 
saying damn Johnny,

2636
01:56:30,780 --> 01:56:31,613
are you.
So you watched that whole Cuba gooding 

2637
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:35,940
jr thing.
I've only watched one episode.

2638
01:56:35,941 --> 01:56:38,160
I watched one episode last night,
but it brought it all back.

2639
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:40,650
Underrated actor.
Oh yeah.

2640
01:56:40,651 --> 01:56:42,060
He was wanting to ask her.
Yeah,

2641
01:56:42,061 --> 01:56:44,130
I know.
But then sort of dropped off.

2642
01:56:44,131 --> 01:56:44,910
Yeah.
You look at.

2643
01:56:44,910 --> 01:56:49,080
And in that movie he did with the narrow
about being the first black driver.

2644
01:56:49,220 --> 01:56:52,570
He was a man of honor,
who is a phenomenal movie.

2645
01:56:52,571 --> 01:56:53,540
Do you ever see that movie?
No,

2646
01:56:53,550 --> 01:56:54,750
I never even heard of it.
Yeah,

2647
01:56:54,910 --> 01:56:55,710
it's,
I'm,

2648
01:56:55,710 --> 01:56:57,830
I'm pretty sure it's called man of honor
or something.

2649
01:56:58,530 --> 01:57:01,860
Cuba gooding jr place the first black 
deep sea diver.

2650
01:57:02,530 --> 01:57:05,240
And it's true story.
Yeah.

2651
01:57:06,190 --> 01:57:07,950
A man of honor,
2000,

2652
01:57:08,130 --> 01:57:11,340
check that out.
He sort of dropped off in a weird way.

2653
01:57:11,350 --> 01:57:13,130
Like wonder what happened with him.
I don't know.

2654
01:57:13,140 --> 01:57:16,050
It's one of those things when he gets a 
chance to play a role,

2655
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:17,273
he's phenomenal in it.
But so many times he gets these clown 

2656
01:57:20,700 --> 01:57:22,740
movies,
bullshit rolls and stuff like that.

2657
01:57:22,741 --> 01:57:24,720
I don't,
I don't know how Hollywood works on that

2658
01:57:24,721 --> 01:57:25,840
level,
so I don't know what,

2659
01:57:26,250 --> 01:57:26,970
what it is.

2660
01:57:26,970 --> 01:57:28,970
But uh,
the thing is some poor choices,

2661
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:30,700
poor choices.
After a.

2662
01:57:30,950 --> 01:57:33,450
What was the fucking agent movie?
Show me the money.

2663
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:34,373
Fuck Jerry Mcguire Mcguire.
After that movie there was a big drop 

2664
01:57:37,110 --> 01:57:38,650
off.
It happens to you,

2665
01:57:38,651 --> 01:57:41,220
you know?
Same thing happened with a Jamie Foxx.

2666
01:57:42,270 --> 01:57:45,000
Jamie Foxx is still in the Max.
He still does everything.

2667
01:57:45,350 --> 01:57:47,960
I mean,
he was in the ward.

2668
01:57:48,270 --> 01:57:51,390
He was great in Django and that baby 
baby driver.

2669
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:53,100
I didn't see that one.
I heard it was amazing.

2670
01:57:53,101 --> 01:57:53,934
Yeah,
it's great movie.

2671
01:57:54,110 --> 01:57:54,943
It was good.
Met Jamie Foxx is just one of those 

2672
01:57:56,191 --> 01:57:57,960
weird dudes.
It seems like he could do anything.

2673
01:57:58,140 --> 01:57:59,280
Super talent.
Yeah,

2674
01:58:00,270 --> 01:58:01,103
super personable too.
That's the other thing about them is 

2675
01:58:04,130 --> 01:58:06,190
such a normal guy.
Met Him last year,

2676
01:58:06,230 --> 01:58:08,250
couldn't have been nicer.
He was very cool.

2677
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:10,500
Yeah.
He did the podcast a couple months ago.

2678
01:58:11,210 --> 01:58:12,400
It's normal was company.

2679
01:58:12,440 --> 01:58:13,273
There's a recent clip of him describing 
the potential Tyson movie that that 

2680
01:58:16,731 --> 01:58:19,820
might be making and like the opening of 
it that they might have worked out.

2681
01:58:20,060 --> 01:58:20,893
It's fucking.
It's like a three minute clip of him 

2682
01:58:22,311 --> 01:58:24,680
just describing it during a little tyson
impression in there.

2683
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:25,870
Oh,
well he can really

2684
01:58:26,060 --> 01:58:26,893
amazing impressions.
He would be great as Tyson just have to 

2685
01:58:29,631 --> 01:58:34,480
to a lot of roids yeah.
He's gonna have to get real quick bail.

2686
01:58:34,490 --> 01:58:39,490
Completely different body types anyway.
To have to actually learn how to box.

2687
01:58:40,700 --> 01:58:41,533
I don't know if he does,
but if you can't have a guy like you 

2688
01:58:45,331 --> 01:58:47,140
might have trained some.
When he did Ali,

2689
01:58:47,160 --> 01:58:47,993
who was.
He was what?

2690
01:58:48,100 --> 01:58:51,070
Ali's corner man when I'm.
Will Smith Played Ali.

2691
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:54,340
Wasn't he Bundini Brown?
Yeah,

2692
01:58:54,341 --> 01:58:55,870
he was.
Yeah,

2693
01:58:56,260 --> 01:58:57,940
he will.
Smith pulled it off.

2694
01:58:57,970 --> 01:59:00,670
He looked like a boxer.
He looked like he had been training,

2695
01:59:01,030 --> 01:59:03,880
but there's a few guys that you don't.
So yeah,

2696
01:59:03,881 --> 01:59:07,450
there is a.
yeah,

2697
01:59:07,451 --> 01:59:09,370
there's a few guys that just don't pull 
it off.

2698
01:59:09,420 --> 01:59:10,253
The,
the,

2699
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:14,350
when you're playing a fighter,
like even Russell Crowe,

2700
01:59:14,351 --> 01:59:18,640
when he played Jim Braddock is like not 
buying.

2701
01:59:18,641 --> 01:59:23,641
You imagine if boxing really was like 
movie fights where every punch connects.

2702
01:59:25,370 --> 01:59:26,203
Well,
some fights are go watch a turtle Gotti 

2703
01:59:28,211 --> 01:59:30,820
versus Micky Ward.
Those fucking fights.

2704
01:59:30,860 --> 01:59:31,693
Literally we're movie fights.
That's what everybody was so jazzed up 

2705
01:59:33,941 --> 01:59:38,941
about some of the most.
I mean blood and guts fights for sure,

2706
01:59:39,311 --> 01:59:42,580
but preposterous fights and stood right 
in front of each other and beat the shit

2707
01:59:42,581 --> 01:59:44,310
out of each other.
That was um,

2708
01:59:44,530 --> 01:59:47,410
Hagler hearns.
That was the only fight I saw that,

2709
01:59:47,411 --> 01:59:48,610
that was a movie for like,
yeah,

2710
01:59:48,611 --> 01:59:52,420
we're just gonna stand here and just 
punch each other until it's over.

2711
01:59:53,420 --> 01:59:58,330
Just decided that that fight.
He mean he fought very strategically and

2712
01:59:58,331 --> 01:59:59,580
most fights,
you know,

2713
01:59:59,780 --> 02:00:00,613
when he fought Mugabi with Gabi was a 
murderous puncher and he took Mugabi in 

2714
02:00:04,031 --> 02:00:06,130
the deep water and then fucked him up 
and stopped him.

2715
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:07,233
But not earns.
He said I'm going to jump right in your 

2716
02:00:08,561 --> 02:00:09,450
face,
motherfucker.

2717
02:00:09,550 --> 02:00:10,560
They didn't like each.

2718
02:00:10,590 --> 02:00:11,240
No,
they didn't.

2719
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:15,370
They didn't break his hand like that to 
keep punching.

2720
02:00:15,371 --> 02:00:18,660
He broke his hand on his head and he 
heard haggler yeah.

2721
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:22,960
He stunned Hagler in the first round.
But hagler had a preposterous chin.

2722
02:00:23,410 --> 02:00:26,950
Postrace he's only knocked down.
His entire career was a bullshit knocked

2723
02:00:26,951 --> 02:00:29,770
down.
I for get who was it?

2724
02:00:29,771 --> 02:00:32,620
Knocked him down.
But uh,

2725
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:35,350
some Argentinian dude,
but it was a bullshit.

2726
02:00:35,351 --> 02:00:36,184
Knocked down,
was a fake,

2727
02:00:36,190 --> 02:00:37,450
knocked out.
Was like a slip.

2728
02:00:37,570 --> 02:00:39,910
And then he moved to Italy and started 
making movies.

2729
02:00:39,970 --> 02:00:42,160
Just banging Italian tricks.
If you go to Italy,

2730
02:00:42,161 --> 02:00:43,450
man,
I know you realize.

2731
02:00:43,451 --> 02:00:44,840
You're like,
why am I trying so hard?

2732
02:00:44,870 --> 02:00:46,900
Very big.
Came down.

2733
02:00:46,930 --> 02:00:48,400
Yeah.
Yeah.

2734
02:00:49,030 --> 02:00:51,100
The Night Marvin Hagler was not knocked 
down.

2735
02:00:51,101 --> 02:00:53,290
They should.
That's a fucking stain on his record,

2736
02:00:53,291 --> 02:00:55,120
man.
That should go back and remove that.

2737
02:00:55,270 --> 02:00:57,860
It was not a knock down.
You can see that car.

2738
02:00:57,940 --> 02:00:58,960
They got to play it.
Play it.

2739
02:00:59,350 --> 02:01:01,000
Let's watch.
Oh,

2740
02:01:01,660 --> 02:01:05,560
see if you could find that the knockdown
in some bullshit fucking knocked down.

2741
02:01:05,860 --> 02:01:10,840
They don't have a clip of role.
Dan Knocking Down Marvin Hagler.

2742
02:01:11,860 --> 02:01:14,680
Marvin hadn't still beat his ass.
He had um,

2743
02:01:15,310 --> 02:01:18,990
ridiculous muscles on the side of his 
head that was like,

2744
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:24,000
he was built with like,
he was born with my gear temples.

2745
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:25,713
They said the,
the muscles that surrounded his temples 

2746
02:01:28,001 --> 02:01:30,370
were three times larger than a normal 
person's.

2747
02:01:30,430 --> 02:01:31,300
Oh,
that happens,

2748
02:01:31,301 --> 02:01:31,910
right?
Certainly.

2749
02:01:31,910 --> 02:01:33,250
Yeah,
for sure man.

2750
02:01:33,370 --> 02:01:36,770
Some guys have bigger dicks.
Yeah.

2751
02:01:37,120 --> 02:01:38,770
Yeah.
Just show it real quick.

2752
02:01:39,300 --> 02:01:42,290
Let's see here.
Pull shit knocked down.

2753
02:01:42,291 --> 02:01:43,124
I mean he just like pushed down the back
of his head that they're going to show 

2754
02:01:48,081 --> 02:01:49,070
it the.
Oh,

2755
02:01:49,071 --> 02:01:50,630
they're going to show it in between 
rounds.

2756
02:01:51,370 --> 02:01:53,120
Yeah.
Just let it go for a second here.

2757
02:01:53,480 --> 02:01:54,313
What'd you do?

2758
02:01:54,540 --> 02:01:58,790
I just want to show just in between 
rounds,

2759
02:01:58,791 --> 02:02:01,610
they'll show it on the replay.
So went back to his corner,

2760
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:02,833
48 Kaos and he's 62 fights and he's one 
of the few guys that when he lost to 

2761
02:02:09,451 --> 02:02:12,230
sugar ray Leonard and he just went,
fuck this.

2762
02:02:12,770 --> 02:02:15,500
And I don't think he lost that fight.
I've watched that fight a few times.

2763
02:02:15,980 --> 02:02:16,813
I thought it was a decision for hire.
Should have been a decision for how to 

2764
02:02:19,380 --> 02:02:21,500
look at this.
See this totally slipped.

2765
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,690
Total slip.
He's.

2766
02:02:23,700 --> 02:02:27,560
He mostly missed the punch.
The Punch.

2767
02:02:28,130 --> 02:02:30,590
Let's see.
He just kind of pushed him down with his

2768
02:02:30,591 --> 02:02:31,424
forearm and Hagler bounced right up.
That is not a knockdown you mother 

2769
02:02:34,381 --> 02:02:37,760
fuckers.
But he took some bombs from Mugabe.

2770
02:02:37,790 --> 02:02:40,710
Mugabe was murdering people at the time,
but you know,

2771
02:02:40,890 --> 02:02:42,350
we're were talking about football 
players.

2772
02:02:42,351 --> 02:02:45,410
Boxers is another one where they don't 
know when to let it go.

2773
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:46,760
Yeah.
Like you got,

2774
02:02:46,820 --> 02:02:48,920
you got.
You can only take so many punches to the

2775
02:02:48,921 --> 02:02:49,900
hit.
Yeah.

2776
02:02:49,901 --> 02:02:51,560
Well,
and then they find it as well.

2777
02:02:51,830 --> 02:02:53,530
Chocolate Dell's talking about making a 
comeback.

2778
02:02:53,570 --> 02:02:54,403
Now you get hooked on the fame,
but you gotta at some point you got to 

2779
02:02:58,380 --> 02:03:00,520
the end.
It's not even when they get old,

2780
02:03:00,521 --> 02:03:03,240
it's when they get to like 50,
like late forties,

2781
02:03:03,320 --> 02:03:04,153
50 unique in that.
I mean the dells talking about making a 

2782
02:03:06,381 --> 02:03:07,214
comeback now at 48 and I think he's been
out of the fight game for at least five 

2783
02:03:11,301 --> 02:03:14,390
or six years.
The UFC gave him a no,

2784
02:03:14,450 --> 02:03:18,470
I'm like sort of a no show job for 
awhile and they said,

2785
02:03:18,471 --> 02:03:20,210
look,
you don't have to work.

2786
02:03:20,540 --> 02:03:21,373
He just come in and do some events every
now and then you get a chunk of money 

2787
02:03:23,961 --> 02:03:27,830
every month and so he was living off 
that and doing really well with that,

2788
02:03:28,220 --> 02:03:31,190
but then the UFC sold and when the UFC 
sold,

2789
02:03:31,191 --> 02:03:32,330
they killed those jobs.

2790
02:03:33,020 --> 02:03:33,853
This whole fucking ufc sold things so 
crazy because they bought it for 

2791
02:03:36,561 --> 02:03:41,561
$4,000,000,000.
Billion like to make the monthly nut.

2792
02:03:43,070 --> 02:03:43,903
They had to cut 100 jobs from the UFC.
100 people got fired and now they gotta 

2793
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:51,400
they gotta figure out some way to.
Well,

2794
02:03:51,410 --> 02:03:52,243
it's not just that,
it's like you gotta you gotta make 

2795
02:03:54,321 --> 02:03:57,080
payments every month.
So they sold some more of it off.

2796
02:03:57,110 --> 02:03:57,943
They sold some more of the assets off to
some other corporations or some other 

2797
02:04:00,621 --> 02:04:03,620
people and I'm glad I don't have to deal
with that shit dude.

2798
02:04:04,250 --> 02:04:07,670
I just show up and talk.
I don't know.

2799
02:04:07,671 --> 02:04:10,500
I don't envy the people that have to 
deal with the bean counters.

2800
02:04:11,290 --> 02:04:12,320
What?
I mean,

2801
02:04:12,350 --> 02:04:15,230
what is worth $4,000,000,000?
Zero wars.

2802
02:04:16,130 --> 02:04:17,170
Yes.
Yeah.

2803
02:04:17,830 --> 02:04:22,830
You can just say it and,
and it was like worth it.

2804
02:04:23,570 --> 02:04:24,403
Yeah.
Like I bought star wars for 

2805
02:04:25,431 --> 02:04:27,560
$4,000,000,000
and I'm making money.

2806
02:04:27,650 --> 02:04:28,700
Yeah,
that makes sense.

2807
02:04:28,910 --> 02:04:29,960
Yeah.
Disney bought that,

2808
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:34,240
but then they put star wars rides and 
like absolute shit.

2809
02:04:34,710 --> 02:04:35,620
Disney,
you know,

2810
02:04:35,630 --> 02:04:38,010
you can you ever do get charged towards 
judge our

2811
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:38,843
banks to come to your birthday party?
I bet there's a whole team of them 

2812
02:04:41,701 --> 02:04:42,534
probably.
Have you done that ride at Disneyland 

2813
02:04:44,470 --> 02:04:45,600
was the last time you've been at 
Disneyland?

2814
02:04:45,750 --> 02:04:47,420
Sit down that ride.
You go there.

2815
02:04:47,421 --> 02:04:49,920
It's like a virtual identities here.
Star Wars.

2816
02:04:49,921 --> 02:04:51,210
Right?
That ride is awesome.

2817
02:04:51,211 --> 02:04:52,380
Yeah.
I mean,

2818
02:04:52,530 --> 02:04:54,450
again,
it's when Disney does something,

2819
02:04:54,451 --> 02:04:56,780
they're going to do it right.
The movies like the,

2820
02:04:57,050 --> 02:05:00,990
they're not going to be any more of 
those banks movies or any of that.

2821
02:05:00,991 --> 02:05:01,830
Like this.
And he's like,

2822
02:05:01,831 --> 02:05:03,480
yeah,
we were going to handle this.

2823
02:05:03,540 --> 02:05:04,710
Yeah.
That guy didn't work out.

2824
02:05:04,830 --> 02:05:06,200
He's still,
he's in the uh,

2825
02:05:06,210 --> 02:05:07,980
the Star tours movie though.
Yeah.

2826
02:05:08,020 --> 02:05:10,350
That thing,
the little thing where sometimes you run

2827
02:05:10,351 --> 02:05:12,810
into him like underwater is driving and 
everybody gets excited,

2828
02:05:13,050 --> 02:05:16,620
but it's a.
But the quality of movies went back up.

2829
02:05:16,890 --> 02:05:17,880
Oh yeah,
for sure.

2830
02:05:17,881 --> 02:05:19,380
You know,
they don't play games.

2831
02:05:19,410 --> 02:05:20,820
Yeah,
a lot of money invested.

2832
02:05:20,910 --> 02:05:24,300
They're doing a star wars park at 
Disneyland.

2833
02:05:24,360 --> 02:05:26,250
Yeah,
some gigantic fucking.

2834
02:05:26,280 --> 02:05:27,113
He was a.
It was what was it used to be called 

2835
02:05:28,981 --> 02:05:31,410
tomorrow land or something like that was
something else.

2836
02:05:31,411 --> 02:05:34,470
And they're converting it and making the
whole star wars.

2837
02:05:34,530 --> 02:05:35,363
Yeah.
They said it's going to be opening like 

2838
02:05:36,420 --> 02:05:38,160
two years.
It's going to be insane.

2839
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:41,580
I don't know how old you are,
but do you remember when the first movie

2840
02:05:41,581 --> 02:05:42,171
came?
So yeah.

2841
02:05:42,171 --> 02:05:43,710
You remember when the first movie came 
out?

2842
02:05:43,740 --> 02:05:44,670
Fuck yeah.
Like,

2843
02:05:44,730 --> 02:05:48,150
like think about that when think about 
George Lucas,

2844
02:05:48,151 --> 02:05:51,570
like I'm gonna make a movie that's going
to change culture.

2845
02:05:51,690 --> 02:05:56,580
It is literally gonna Bring Lang like 
change language.

2846
02:05:56,581 --> 02:05:57,970
Like we're going to have,
you know,

2847
02:05:58,050 --> 02:05:59,410
things we talk about,
right?

2848
02:05:59,430 --> 02:06:00,263
Like Jedi mind tricks and force.
And it's got to be mind boggling to sit 

2849
02:06:06,061 --> 02:06:06,900
back and say,
yeah,

2850
02:06:06,901 --> 02:06:08,280
I created this whole thing.

2851
02:06:08,670 --> 02:06:09,503
Got to be mind boggling,
but do you think he set out to do that 

2852
02:06:11,281 --> 02:06:12,340
to me?
He set out to just make.

2853
02:06:12,920 --> 02:06:13,753
No,
he just set out to make a great movie 

2854
02:06:15,120 --> 02:06:15,953
and all the buttons for people.
Everything for for generations and 

2855
02:06:20,220 --> 02:06:22,740
generations to be like,
you know,

2856
02:06:23,370 --> 02:06:24,203
he does all the things.
He had the rebel with the fucking giant 

2857
02:06:26,401 --> 02:06:29,670
gorilla that followed them around the 
gun wise.

2858
02:06:29,671 --> 02:06:31,410
Yoda,
Yoda,

2859
02:06:32,190 --> 02:06:33,023
Yoda.
He had the old man who is the master 

2860
02:06:35,010 --> 02:06:37,240
who's showing them how to do it in the 
master dies.

2861
02:06:37,320 --> 02:06:39,660
None of the greatest villains of all 
time.

2862
02:06:40,160 --> 02:06:42,060
The best guy who killed people.
His mind.

2863
02:06:42,061 --> 02:06:43,130
Yeah.
Yeah.

2864
02:06:43,560 --> 02:06:46,020
Any.
Any fucking you didn't see his eyes,

2865
02:06:46,140 --> 02:06:47,990
couldn't see anything.
No emotion.

2866
02:06:48,200 --> 02:06:49,070
He just,
yeah,

2867
02:06:49,860 --> 02:06:51,500
he just,
he would breathe.

2868
02:06:52,130 --> 02:06:52,963
He would.
That was the shit and imagined being a 

2869
02:06:55,081 --> 02:06:55,914
storm trooper.
Just an average storm trooper and you 

2870
02:06:57,691 --> 02:07:00,630
hear this coming down the hall,
you're like,

2871
02:07:00,631 --> 02:07:02,070
Oh shit,
I might die.

2872
02:07:02,340 --> 02:07:05,400
I might die.
Like I don't know if I did my job right,

2873
02:07:06,120 --> 02:07:08,130
but maybe he just needs to make an 
example.

2874
02:07:08,870 --> 02:07:12,500
Try watching it today though.
So it's not it,

2875
02:07:13,010 --> 02:07:15,930
but it still,
it's only still great because it,

2876
02:07:16,110 --> 02:07:18,480
it brings back the memory of how great 
it was,

2877
02:07:19,020 --> 02:07:20,880
but no,
it's not the movie it was then,

2878
02:07:20,881 --> 02:07:25,230
but we'd never seen anything like that 
jump into hyperspace.

2879
02:07:25,860 --> 02:07:26,693
Yeah.
Yeah.

2880
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:28,770
It's amazing.
The special effects were terrible.

2881
02:07:29,160 --> 02:07:30,860
Did you ever see,
um,

2882
02:07:31,180 --> 02:07:34,770
dark theater with the actor's voice?
The actual actor?

2883
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:35,651
No.
Yeah,

2884
02:07:35,651 --> 02:07:38,170
you can see it on youtube.
Exactly.

2885
02:07:38,260 --> 02:07:40,570
Well,
not exactly because you know,

2886
02:07:40,571 --> 02:07:42,000
the actor had to do the lines.

2887
02:07:44,040 --> 02:07:47,290
That's not quite the impact of James 
Earl Jones,

2888
02:07:47,460 --> 02:07:51,100
James Earl Jones voice.
That guy has ving.

2889
02:07:51,101 --> 02:07:51,934
Rhames is the modern,
the modern version that ving rhames has 

2890
02:07:54,120 --> 02:07:58,340
a lot a voice in the UFC and tell you 
to,

2891
02:07:58,460 --> 02:07:59,293
you're talking to a guy with a voice who
can't get a job because those guys do 

2892
02:08:03,191 --> 02:08:03,850
it.
Yeah.

2893
02:08:03,850 --> 02:08:04,683
Yeah.
Because I lost one to Danny Glover and 

2894
02:08:07,661 --> 02:08:08,580
I'm like,
if I ever meet,

2895
02:08:08,620 --> 02:08:09,221
but I'm like,
man,

2896
02:08:09,221 --> 02:08:13,390
you got lethal weapon money.
A Guinness beer commercial.

2897
02:08:13,391 --> 02:08:16,960
I needed that competition out there bro.
And nobody's gonna lay down for you.

2898
02:08:17,290 --> 02:08:19,580
Nobody at work.
Especially not in the voiceover.

2899
02:08:19,710 --> 02:08:21,640
I got to start punching people in the 
throat.

2900
02:08:23,610 --> 02:08:25,690
The voice over games.
A weird game.

2901
02:08:25,691 --> 02:08:26,830
Right.
There's some dudes like,

2902
02:08:27,100 --> 02:08:29,280
you know,
who is an interesting one is uh,

2903
02:08:29,310 --> 02:08:32,020
the guy from Ray Donovan.
Fuck's his name?

2904
02:08:33,130 --> 02:08:34,410
Schreiber.
Lave.

2905
02:08:34,630 --> 02:08:37,780
Do you say it live?
Live Schreiber.

2906
02:08:38,170 --> 02:08:39,340
But he's really good at it.

2907
02:08:39,370 --> 02:08:42,080
He does a lot of the UFC wants for Fox 
and um,

2908
02:08:42,160 --> 02:08:44,590
I can never remember his name,
but um,

2909
02:08:45,220 --> 02:08:46,990
Donald Sutherland.
Oh yeah.

2910
02:08:48,300 --> 02:08:53,300
He's the voice of Delta Boys.
He's the voice of juice because he know.

2911
02:08:55,960 --> 02:08:57,790
Is it Donald Sutherland?
Am I saying that right?

2912
02:08:57,791 --> 02:08:59,980
It's at the right actor.
The guy with the white hair.

2913
02:08:59,981 --> 02:09:04,390
The Donald Sutherland is the guy who was
in a invasion of the body snatchers,

2914
02:09:04,840 --> 02:09:09,840
maybe 80 to the same guy he did.
He just did the hunger games movies.

2915
02:09:09,911 --> 02:09:12,790
He was like the,
the president and the hunger games.

2916
02:09:12,791 --> 02:09:13,624
That's the guy,
right?

2917
02:09:14,530 --> 02:09:15,640
With Helen Mirren?
Yeah.

2918
02:09:15,970 --> 02:09:16,720
Yeah.
That guy.

2919
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:18,850
He does a ton.
Whenever I think of him,

2920
02:09:18,851 --> 02:09:20,260
I think of invasion of the body.

2921
02:09:22,180 --> 02:09:25,220
Then when he became one of the guys and 
uh,

2922
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:26,540
you know,
who's getting paid?

2923
02:09:26,541 --> 02:09:29,650
I'm the guy who does the allstate,
you know,

2924
02:09:29,750 --> 02:09:32,240
there's another one that I could have 
done that guy.

2925
02:09:32,270 --> 02:09:35,180
I could have Dennis Haysburt.
I could have done that for a lot less.

2926
02:09:35,630 --> 02:09:36,463
He knows his name.
A friend of mine used to work with him 

2927
02:09:38,721 --> 02:09:40,910
on a series.
That's why I know his name,

2928
02:09:40,911 --> 02:09:44,420
but you can go to any mall in America 
and he was also a real estate guy.

2929
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:47,450
He was also in major league pitchers.
Toronto.

2930
02:09:47,510 --> 02:09:48,343
That's.
Yeah,

2931
02:09:48,360 --> 02:09:52,040
he was Toronto and Major League jumbo.
I don't remember that at all.

2932
02:09:52,130 --> 02:09:54,840
I barely remember major league.
Major League.

2933
02:09:54,870 --> 02:09:56,390
Oh yeah,
that's him.

2934
02:09:56,420 --> 02:09:58,110
Major League.
I love that movie.

2935
02:09:58,160 --> 02:10:00,860
That's how.
That was a fun fucking movie that.

2936
02:10:00,861 --> 02:10:03,920
That's one of those movies that if 
you're flicking channels and it's on.

2937
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:05,990
I'm watching.
Yeah.

2938
02:10:06,980 --> 02:10:08,630
Charlie Sheen back before the crack.

2939
02:10:08,810 --> 02:10:10,400
Yep.
Wesley snipes.

2940
02:10:10,401 --> 02:10:14,330
When he was paying taxes on the second 
one,

2941
02:10:14,570 --> 02:10:15,403
I tried to act like it wasn't.
Omar epps played the same character in 

2942
02:10:17,361 --> 02:10:19,100
the second month.
Really?

2943
02:10:19,120 --> 02:10:22,790
They replace Wesley Wesley on a bunch of
issues.

2944
02:10:22,890 --> 02:10:23,723
There was a great patent.
Oswald bet he does about being in blade 

2945
02:10:26,661 --> 02:10:31,520
two and about how they replaced Wesley 
snipes halfway in the movie.

2946
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:34,100
Like it's western,
I don't know,

2947
02:10:34,340 --> 02:10:35,173
allegedly was,
was fucking around with coke or 

2948
02:10:37,761 --> 02:10:40,730
something and just was completely off 
his rocker,

2949
02:10:41,060 --> 02:10:43,120
you know,
it was a weird time for him.

2950
02:10:43,790 --> 02:10:45,800
I've got a friend who grew up with them.
Yeah,

2951
02:10:45,950 --> 02:10:46,783
I mean literally like Wesley was 
sleeping on his couch when he got his 

2952
02:10:50,931 --> 02:10:54,170
first American Express commercial.
His first acting job.

2953
02:10:54,960 --> 02:10:56,530
Yeah.
And uh,

2954
02:10:57,530 --> 02:10:59,450
and then he got,
I forgot what movie,

2955
02:10:59,451 --> 02:11:00,284
He did some movie,
I think it was a fight movie or 

2956
02:11:01,281 --> 02:11:03,620
something like that.
And he kind of disappeared.

2957
02:11:03,621 --> 02:11:05,510
And my buddy's wife,
she's always like,

2958
02:11:05,540 --> 02:11:07,640
you better never.
Wesley snipes us.

2959
02:11:07,820 --> 02:11:10,090
Oh,
you better not disappeared.

2960
02:11:10,150 --> 02:11:13,220
You first movie commercial for Western 
Union.

2961
02:11:14,030 --> 02:11:18,950
It was good that commercials commercial 
money was always a big thing.

2962
02:11:18,951 --> 02:11:20,400
Right.
Then you got,

2963
02:11:20,810 --> 02:11:24,500
if you've got a national commercial back
then you got paid back.

2964
02:11:24,501 --> 02:11:25,334
That up here.
Went to the scene where the pipe was 

2965
02:11:27,411 --> 02:11:28,244
going off.

2966
02:11:30,930 --> 02:11:31,770
God Damn

2967
02:11:33,530 --> 02:11:37,280
hilarious.
Look at the computer guy.

2968
02:11:37,300 --> 02:11:41,270
Look at the computer back then.
So western union,

2969
02:11:41,410 --> 02:11:46,410
while punching numbers into a terminal,
got to get that bail money.

2970
02:11:47,211 --> 02:11:51,650
So that's our lifetime in our lifetime.
Things have changed so radically.

2971
02:11:52,250 --> 02:11:56,210
Just stop and think about 30 years 
before that it wasn't much different.

2972
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:58,340
It was a little different but not like 
it.

2973
02:11:58,341 --> 02:12:00,890
It is now.
When you think about parents' lifetimes.

2974
02:12:00,940 --> 02:12:01,970
Yeah,
exactly.

2975
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:05,270
To go from radio.
Have lived from radio to the Internet.

2976
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:10,590
Not that my mom will mess with the end 
of that and mom doesn't fuck with him.

2977
02:12:11,140 --> 02:12:14,750
We tried her church,
started doing the bulletins online.

2978
02:12:14,751 --> 02:12:17,300
So we gave her a smartphone like a few 
years ago.

2979
02:12:17,301 --> 02:12:18,890
I gave her one of those.
Um,

2980
02:12:20,080 --> 02:12:21,590
what do they call it?
The cricket phone.

2981
02:12:21,830 --> 02:12:24,080
Oh yeah.
Where it has like four numbers on it and

2982
02:12:24,081 --> 02:12:26,990
that's all you do.
And well they made a smartphone version.

2983
02:12:27,010 --> 02:12:29,630
It literally has one button that says 
email the button,

2984
02:12:29,631 --> 02:12:33,380
it says text button that says pictures 
at a button that says call.

2985
02:12:33,710 --> 02:12:34,520
And it's like,
mom,

2986
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:36,980
I can't like,
this is the simplest we could do.

2987
02:12:37,220 --> 02:12:38,900
She wouldn't do it.
She won't mess with it.

2988
02:12:39,230 --> 02:12:41,540
Wow.
Bad for a long time.

2989
02:12:41,541 --> 02:12:43,100
You know,
my mom was still like,

2990
02:12:43,280 --> 02:12:47,620
talk fast as long distance,
you know.

2991
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:49,600
It was like,
don't worry mom,

2992
02:12:49,820 --> 02:12:51,470
I got this.
I got long distance.

2993
02:12:51,471 --> 02:12:54,110
Money ain't rich,
but I got long distance money.

2994
02:12:55,100 --> 02:12:56,480
That's right.
Remember when,

2995
02:12:56,720 --> 02:12:57,553
remember when roaming,
where you would drive your car an hour 

2996
02:13:00,440 --> 02:13:04,760
outside of where your coverage area was.
She'd be fucked if you got a t and t you

2997
02:13:04,761 --> 02:13:09,761
still got Romeo,
man a t and t they used to just raped me

2998
02:13:09,861 --> 02:13:12,020
when I traveled.
It was ridiculous.

2999
02:13:12,050 --> 02:13:12,831
Really?
Oh,

3000
02:13:12,831 --> 02:13:13,664
and then forget what,
like when you went to the festival in 

3001
02:13:15,081 --> 02:13:16,490
Montreal,
it's like,

3002
02:13:16,491 --> 02:13:17,324
listen,
I'm gonna need my pay plus m a t and t 

3003
02:13:18,711 --> 02:13:22,250
money might make a call one call.

3004
02:13:22,310 --> 02:13:24,260
Yeah.
I know a lot of dudes or use their phone

3005
02:13:24,261 --> 02:13:25,094
overseas and didn't know when they got a
thousand dollars bill and got back home 

3006
02:13:27,830 --> 02:13:30,950
like a thousand dollars per phone call.
And the one guy he did,

3007
02:13:30,990 --> 02:13:34,920
he used his data.
He kept using his phone.

3008
02:13:35,940 --> 02:13:36,773
He had a $3,000.
Bill when he came back from Montreal is 

3009
02:13:40,141 --> 02:13:44,220
data was on 24 slash seven for like 
eight days.

3010
02:13:44,300 --> 02:13:47,770
It's how can they charge you that much?
That's just rude.

3011
02:13:48,420 --> 02:13:50,340
They cut it in half or something like 
that,

3012
02:13:50,341 --> 02:13:52,210
but it was still.
Yeah,

3013
02:13:52,980 --> 02:13:54,480
they give you a break.
Unreal.

3014
02:13:54,510 --> 02:13:55,950
So sweet of them.
Yeah,

3015
02:13:57,360 --> 02:13:58,193
but it's interesting that competition is
sort of erase that whole roaming thing 

3016
02:14:01,020 --> 02:14:06,020
like because more people were jockeying 
for a share of the market rises and t,

3017
02:14:06,781 --> 02:14:07,614
t mobile,
all these different people and players 

3018
02:14:08,791 --> 02:14:12,390
and sprint and they just had to make 
some concessions for competition.

3019
02:14:12,750 --> 02:14:15,900
Well the next big test is going to be a 
thousand dollars iphone,

3020
02:14:17,130 --> 02:14:18,510
right?
Because if people pay it,

3021
02:14:19,440 --> 02:14:21,030
then that's what phones are going to 
cost.

3022
02:14:21,090 --> 02:14:23,640
Well isn't that new Samsung Galaxy note 
eight?

3023
02:14:23,641 --> 02:14:26,730
Isn't that similarly priced?
They're both going to be up there.

3024
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:28,410
Yeah,
they're basically computers.

3025
02:14:28,470 --> 02:14:30,540
That note eight is pretty fucking sweet,
man.

3026
02:14:30,690 --> 02:14:32,060
They're bad ass,
but that's a.

3027
02:14:32,100 --> 02:14:32,933
that's a big jump.
That's basically you're doubling the 

3028
02:14:34,891 --> 02:14:36,380
price of a cell phone,
is it?

3029
02:14:36,381 --> 02:14:37,950
You know,
what are the new ones now?

3030
02:14:37,951 --> 02:14:40,290
I think new ones now are five to 600 
bucks.

3031
02:14:40,760 --> 02:14:44,190
I didn't just buy it,
but that's the point,

3032
02:14:44,191 --> 02:14:46,050
but now you're not going to get that,
you know,

3033
02:14:46,051 --> 02:14:47,190
you know,
because it's always been.

3034
02:14:47,191 --> 02:14:50,100
You get the discount if they sign up for
two years or so that,

3035
02:14:50,450 --> 02:14:53,700
well apparently with this one it's going
to be just you gotta just by the phone.

3036
02:14:54,230 --> 02:14:56,060
They're just kinda getting greedy.
Yeah.

3037
02:14:56,061 --> 02:14:56,894
So it's.
I think it's a test because if people 

3038
02:14:58,711 --> 02:15:01,350
don't go for it then they'll be like,
oh,

3039
02:15:01,410 --> 02:15:04,000
well we got to go back to the old model 
and uh,

3040
02:15:04,260 --> 02:15:05,093
will be willing to pay more money for a 
phone if you knew that the phone was 

3041
02:15:09,481 --> 02:15:13,560
made by people that got paid a living 
wage.

3042
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:14,820
Yeah,
I would.

3043
02:15:14,910 --> 02:15:15,810
Yeah.
I'm,

3044
02:15:15,850 --> 02:15:17,150
I'm all about that man.
I'm,

3045
02:15:17,151 --> 02:15:21,390
I'm fine with paying more for something 
to take care of the employees.

3046
02:15:21,690 --> 02:15:22,240
That's the

3047
02:15:22,240 --> 02:15:24,570
best argument for made in America.
You know,

3048
02:15:24,580 --> 02:15:25,413
that made in America argument is like,
some people look at it as patriotism or 

3049
02:15:28,211 --> 02:15:29,044
nationalism and I could see that,
but there's also the argument of it's 

3050
02:15:31,541 --> 02:15:33,730
made in America.
Then people have to get paid,

3051
02:15:33,860 --> 02:15:35,560
you know,
like at least a minimum wage.

3052
02:15:35,830 --> 02:15:36,600
Know,
you know,

3053
02:15:36,600 --> 02:15:37,433
who said it and it,
and it's been lost and I think it's one 

3054
02:15:39,241 --> 02:15:41,640
of his great quote,
Henry Ford,

3055
02:15:42,510 --> 02:15:44,460
Henry Ford,
to never forget,

3056
02:15:44,461 --> 02:15:47,100
you have to pay them enough to buy the 
cars.

3057
02:15:47,320 --> 02:15:50,010
Uh,
that's a smart quote.

3058
02:15:50,190 --> 02:15:52,680
And they forgot.
Henry Ford was a wizard.

3059
02:15:52,920 --> 02:15:53,540
Yeah.

3060
02:15:53,540 --> 02:15:54,373
Henry Ford also figured out that you can
make fenders out of hemp and have far 

3061
02:15:58,401 --> 02:16:00,290
superior to metal.
Yeah.

3062
02:16:00,400 --> 02:16:01,233
There's an old video.
You're seeing those old video of his 

3063
02:16:03,141 --> 02:16:04,460
first car.
No.

3064
02:16:04,610 --> 02:16:05,443
His first car that he made had fenders 
made out of hemp and he's banging it 

3065
02:16:09,441 --> 02:16:12,530
with a hammer and the hammer is just bow
hemp is.

3066
02:16:13,100 --> 02:16:13,933
Forget about whatever anybody feels 
about marijuana and stoners are always 

3067
02:16:16,821 --> 02:16:21,710
trying to push it on us.
Just hemp itself as a textile,

3068
02:16:21,711 --> 02:16:25,700
as a,
as a commodity hemp when they use him to

3069
02:16:25,701 --> 02:16:28,970
make things out of hemp is a very 
strange.

3070
02:16:29,850 --> 02:16:30,683
Where if you had a piece of hemp,
like the size of this water bottle is a 

3071
02:16:33,521 --> 02:16:34,660
large water bottle.
Right?

3072
02:16:34,930 --> 02:16:36,970
Have you had a piece of hemp that was 
that thick?

3073
02:16:37,270 --> 02:16:40,270
It would be hard like oak,
but light,

3074
02:16:40,271 --> 02:16:42,700
like Balsa Wood.
It's fucking weird.

3075
02:16:42,701 --> 02:16:45,760
Similar to bamboo or it's similar to 
bamboo,

3076
02:16:45,761 --> 02:16:47,500
but stronger.
Much stronger.

3077
02:16:47,501 --> 02:16:49,090
It's a very,
very strange.

3078
02:16:49,140 --> 02:16:53,260
It's the impact is 10 times stronger 
than steel.

3079
02:16:53,830 --> 02:16:58,300
Hemp plastic panels.
Now you go see if he can find the video.

3080
02:16:58,301 --> 02:17:03,301
It's a crazy video because in the video 
he's banging on this fucking fender with

3081
02:17:04,361 --> 02:17:05,194
a hammer.
Crazy video because he had my phone to 

3082
02:17:07,511 --> 02:17:08,950
make videos in 1910.

3083
02:17:11,170 --> 02:17:13,450
It probably had a dude,
a truck.

3084
02:17:15,110 --> 02:17:17,630
One of those things.
They probably had to crank it back then,

3085
02:17:17,640 --> 02:17:18,580
right Craig?
Yeah.

3086
02:17:18,880 --> 02:17:20,500
Yeah.
He probably did like,

3087
02:17:20,501 --> 02:17:23,350
that's his car actually.
Pretty Dope car.

3088
02:17:23,351 --> 02:17:26,500
If you had that today,
drive around that bitch with everybody.

3089
02:17:26,501 --> 02:17:27,430
No,
look at this.

3090
02:17:28,540 --> 02:17:31,180
He's wailing on it with a fucking 
heroin.

3091
02:17:31,181 --> 02:17:35,680
It just bounces off and it's completely 
sustainable.

3092
02:17:35,980 --> 02:17:40,980
You can plant it in an area and 
regenerate it within a year.

3093
02:17:41,260 --> 02:17:42,093
Whereas if you have the same issue with 
trees and you try to regenerate an area 

3094
02:17:45,341 --> 02:17:46,780
with trees,
it takes decades.

3095
02:17:46,870 --> 02:17:48,030
So is it?
Well,

3096
02:17:48,031 --> 02:17:51,160
I guess so it'd be more similar to 
bamboo than fiberglass.

3097
02:17:51,250 --> 02:17:53,620
Yes.
More similar to bamboo than fiberglass,

3098
02:17:53,621 --> 02:17:56,620
but superior to both of those things.
It's fucking amazing.

3099
02:17:56,680 --> 02:18:00,730
It's fiberglass cracks and breaks the 
light like fiberglass,

3100
02:18:00,731 --> 02:18:02,710
but far stronger.
I had a,

3101
02:18:02,770 --> 02:18:03,603
uh,
had a corvette that defender just 

3102
02:18:05,021 --> 02:18:06,250
cracked and broke off.

3103
02:18:06,580 --> 02:18:08,930
Oh,
I have a corvette.

3104
02:18:09,100 --> 02:18:11,570
I have an older one.
Got a magnificent more.

3105
02:18:11,650 --> 02:18:12,371
Yeah.
They,

3106
02:18:12,371 --> 02:18:16,810
um,
who made a car recently out of hemp,

3107
02:18:16,840 --> 02:18:17,673
Lotus.
Lotus made a hemp car really recently 

3108
02:18:20,500 --> 02:18:22,840
and you know,
people were hoping that,

3109
02:18:22,841 --> 02:18:23,674
uh,
other manufacturers are gonna start 

3110
02:18:24,491 --> 02:18:28,900
using this because it's actually safer.
It's stronger than fiberglass.

3111
02:18:28,901 --> 02:18:29,734
Safer than fiberglass.
And it's like the similar in terms of 

3112
02:18:32,171 --> 02:18:35,320
its weight,
that stripe down the middle is exposed.

3113
02:18:35,890 --> 02:18:39,430
There's photos where you could see it 
more clearly.

3114
02:18:39,431 --> 02:18:42,340
Jamie cv like just.
Yeah,

3115
02:18:42,341 --> 02:18:43,570
there it is.
So that,

3116
02:18:43,630 --> 02:18:47,570
that is what the actual fiber looks like
where it's not painted and,

3117
02:18:47,600 --> 02:18:48,251
and,
and,

3118
02:18:48,251 --> 02:18:50,860
um,
sealed or it's just sealed rather,

3119
02:18:50,980 --> 02:18:53,470
but not a colored.
So you could see the fiber.

3120
02:18:53,780 --> 02:18:55,210
It's,
it's incredible stuff,

3121
02:18:55,240 --> 02:18:56,073
man.
And it doesn't fuck with the 

3122
02:18:57,641 --> 02:18:59,590
environment.
It's actually good.

3123
02:18:59,591 --> 02:19:03,130
It's a cleaner process.
So why is it not being used?

3124
02:19:03,370 --> 02:19:04,203
Because it's connected to marijuana,
it's the only reason just publishing 

3125
02:19:07,720 --> 02:19:10,240
publicity.
Up until very recently,

3126
02:19:10,450 --> 02:19:12,580
hemp was illegal to grow in the United 
States.

3127
02:19:12,581 --> 02:19:15,370
Now I know this for a fact because my 
company on it,

3128
02:19:15,580 --> 02:19:19,660
we had to buy all of our hemp from 
Canada when we sell hemp protein,

3129
02:19:19,750 --> 02:19:20,583
which is one of the best versions of 
protein that you can get in plant based 

3130
02:19:23,111 --> 02:19:25,930
forum because it has a full amino acid 
profile,

3131
02:19:25,931 --> 02:19:29,470
very easy to digest.
If you get high quality hemp hearts like

3132
02:19:29,520 --> 02:19:30,353
the stuff that we sell real easy going 
down like it doesn't fuck with you or 

3133
02:19:34,131 --> 02:19:34,964
give you a gas.
Like some people have issues with like 

3134
02:19:36,710 --> 02:19:40,940
whey protein if they have any sort of a 
lactose intolerance and some people just

3135
02:19:40,941 --> 02:19:42,050
doesn't.
Doesn't agree with them.

3136
02:19:42,590 --> 02:19:43,423
Hemp is very easy to digest.
I mean I'd take it hemp protein shake 

3137
02:19:46,611 --> 02:19:47,444
and I'll go to the gym like an hour 
later and have no issues working out 

3138
02:19:49,581 --> 02:19:50,414
pretty hard.

3139
02:19:50,450 --> 02:19:53,180
Whereas some stuff,
just see how I fucked up.

3140
02:19:53,181 --> 02:19:54,014
I fucked up eating.
But because of all the laws that have 

3141
02:19:57,260 --> 02:20:02,030
been in existence since the 19 thirties 
regarding hemp and marijuana,

3142
02:20:02,540 --> 02:20:03,373
that's one thing that a lot of people 
don't even realize that the laws were 

3143
02:20:04,881 --> 02:20:09,881
actually put in place to stop hemp as a,
as a commodity,

3144
02:20:10,250 --> 02:20:14,680
not really to stop marijuana.
They stopped marijuana to stop him.

3145
02:20:15,160 --> 02:20:17,630
I mean it was all done by William 
Randolph hearst.

3146
02:20:17,660 --> 02:20:18,493
But this fucking asshole in the 19 
thirties ruined things in 2017 with 

3147
02:20:23,961 --> 02:20:27,440
propaganda that even the term marijuana 
was never used.

3148
02:20:27,441 --> 02:20:28,274
Marijuana was a wild Mexican tobacco.
The reason why they used the term 

3149
02:20:32,091 --> 02:20:34,580
marijuana because they could,
instead of saying cannabis,

3150
02:20:34,581 --> 02:20:36,890
which everybody already knew.
Instead of saying hemp,

3151
02:20:36,891 --> 02:20:38,420
which everybody already knew.
They said,

3152
02:20:38,421 --> 02:20:39,254
well,
there's this drug called marijuana and 

3153
02:20:41,121 --> 02:20:43,770
these Mexicans and blacks are smoking is
drunk and,

3154
02:20:43,860 --> 02:20:44,693
and all the white women.

3155
02:20:46,140 --> 02:20:47,110
Oh yeah.
And the 13,

3156
02:20:47,130 --> 02:20:49,560
that documentary,
they talked about it fucking amazing.

3157
02:20:49,590 --> 02:20:52,430
Anything that with opium and the Chinese
from the railroads,

3158
02:20:52,640 --> 02:20:53,473
you know,
that to this day is why hamp is such a 

3159
02:20:56,341 --> 02:21:01,200
problem in this country.
All that bullshit from 1930 something is

3160
02:21:01,201 --> 02:21:04,500
why we're still.
We still have issues about hemp protein.

3161
02:21:04,530 --> 02:21:06,000
Do you get high off of it?
Anything?

3162
02:21:06,060 --> 02:21:08,310
It doesn't.
It's no thc whatsoever.

3163
02:21:08,430 --> 02:21:12,450
It's just the fiber from the stocks.
It's curious to me personally.

3164
02:21:12,630 --> 02:21:14,310
I'm going to try it.
Yeah.

3165
02:21:14,430 --> 02:21:16,170
Oh,
hemp protein is amazing,

3166
02:21:16,220 --> 02:21:17,450
you know,
but I do.

3167
02:21:17,510 --> 02:21:19,670
You have to tell you the CBDS,
which,

3168
02:21:19,671 --> 02:21:20,120
uh,
you know,

3169
02:21:20,120 --> 02:21:22,730
a really great for pain and pain 
medication or pain,

3170
02:21:23,560 --> 02:21:25,340
inflammation and things along those 
lines.

3171
02:21:25,730 --> 02:21:26,563
Some people,
like Greg Fitzsimmons says he gets high 

3172
02:21:27,741 --> 02:21:27,990
off off of

3173
02:21:27,990 --> 02:21:29,810
it.
I don't understand that.

3174
02:21:30,320 --> 02:21:33,440
He said he tries that,
a Charlotte's web cbd oil,

3175
02:21:33,470 --> 02:21:34,303
which is full profile hemp oil.
He says it gives them hi b might be 

3176
02:21:37,641 --> 02:21:40,190
crazy.
It's fits.

3177
02:21:40,430 --> 02:21:41,200
Who knows?
He's a,

3178
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:44,420
he's a city boy.
Things react per lead is metabolism.

3179
02:21:45,260 --> 02:21:47,930
But if we were,
if we were reasonable and intelligent,

3180
02:21:47,950 --> 02:21:49,670
we'd be making a shitload of things with
hemp.

3181
02:21:50,150 --> 02:21:53,300
Fiber is so easy to regenerate,
so easy to grow.

3182
02:21:53,390 --> 02:21:55,490
It's totally sustainable.
It's healthy.

3183
02:21:55,880 --> 02:21:57,080
Maybe that will,
uh,

3184
02:21:57,140 --> 02:21:57,973
maybe that will change.
I'm hoping maybe that will change in 

3185
02:22:00,051 --> 02:22:02,270
time.
We're slowly,

3186
02:22:02,450 --> 02:22:04,700
slowly waking up and getting rid of 
those.

3187
02:22:05,500 --> 02:22:06,840
Um,
well,

3188
02:22:06,860 --> 02:22:09,140
like you said,
the propaganda that created it.

3189
02:22:09,290 --> 02:22:12,080
You know what another thing is that 
people make plastic with it.

3190
02:22:12,590 --> 02:22:15,980
You can make degradable biodegradable 
hemp plastic.

3191
02:22:16,300 --> 02:22:17,240
Well,
you're going to weed.

3192
02:22:17,241 --> 02:22:18,021
I mean,
you know,

3193
02:22:18,021 --> 02:22:20,060
people do.
We've had legal weed,

3194
02:22:20,090 --> 02:22:20,923
right?
People aren't running the streets 

3195
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:22,840
raping.
I am for.

3196
02:22:22,940 --> 02:22:26,020
Well you might've been.
I just smoke pot.

3197
02:22:26,110 --> 02:22:27,960
I know who I am.
I wake up,

3198
02:22:28,230 --> 02:22:32,430
I'll wake up covered in blood and is an 
argument that it wasn't the wheat.

3199
02:22:32,760 --> 02:22:36,270
Yeah,
that's the idea that,

3200
02:22:36,390 --> 02:22:38,340
you know,
this is the one that's illegal.

3201
02:22:38,400 --> 02:22:41,490
It's so fucking crazy when you can just 
go to a liquor store or just,

3202
02:22:41,690 --> 02:22:42,523
you know,
go to a bar almost anywhere they look 

3203
02:22:45,570 --> 02:22:46,950
and that.
And that's the lobby.

3204
02:22:47,220 --> 02:22:51,390
I read this crazy article about the weed
thing in Vegas,

3205
02:22:51,420 --> 02:22:52,253
like they made a compromise with the 
liquor lobby that you had to have a 

3206
02:22:55,981 --> 02:22:56,814
liquor distributor license to distribute
the marijuana to literally take it to 

3207
02:23:00,361 --> 02:23:05,361
the dispensary's and no one got the 
license so they couldn't deliver it for.

3208
02:23:06,150 --> 02:23:06,983
I mean I'm sure they figured it out,
but initially like nobody could 

3209
02:23:09,751 --> 02:23:11,880
deliberate the liquor company.
He was like,

3210
02:23:11,881 --> 02:23:12,714
well,
why would we deliver it like we don't 

3211
02:23:15,151 --> 02:23:16,050
want to,
you know,

3212
02:23:16,080 --> 02:23:17,100
we want you to drink.

3213
02:23:17,220 --> 02:23:19,260
Well,
they were running into a shortage.

3214
02:23:19,290 --> 02:23:21,660
It was so chaotic when the first.
Because they couldn't,

3215
02:23:21,960 --> 02:23:24,300
couldn't distributed anywhere.
It was crazy.

3216
02:23:24,570 --> 02:23:25,403
Well,
they couldn't keep up with the demand 

3217
02:23:26,101 --> 02:23:27,390
either.
It was just so insane.

3218
02:23:27,470 --> 02:23:28,303
Oh,
no doubt.

3219
02:23:28,800 --> 02:23:29,940
No doubt.
And,

3220
02:23:30,160 --> 02:23:31,980
and they still have the money issue,
right?

3221
02:23:31,981 --> 02:23:33,560
They still have the issue of,
uh,

3222
02:23:33,690 --> 02:23:36,540
the risk of putting into banks,
especially with sessions.

3223
02:23:36,690 --> 02:23:37,523
Yeah.
Sessions wanting to be some anti weed 

3224
02:23:39,211 --> 02:23:40,470
guy.
Little goofy.

3225
02:23:40,471 --> 02:23:42,570
Alf.
One weird fucker.

3226
02:23:42,571 --> 02:23:44,250
That guy is,
you know,

3227
02:23:44,251 --> 02:23:46,350
it's just.
I like watching trump shit on him,

3228
02:23:46,810 --> 02:23:47,643
see him,
just sort of have to swallow it and eat 

3229
02:23:48,751 --> 02:23:49,590
it.
You know,

3230
02:23:49,591 --> 02:23:50,424
in the beginning he was a.
trump was real high on him and in any 

3231
02:23:52,831 --> 02:23:57,450
wouldn't recruit recluse himself because
of the investigation in Russia.

3232
02:23:57,960 --> 02:24:01,830
My favorite joke was when Roy Wood Jr 
called sessions a confederate monument.

3233
02:24:04,390 --> 02:24:07,110
That's a great job.
Yeah.

3234
02:24:07,111 --> 02:24:09,660
He's,
he was a guy that was,

3235
02:24:09,990 --> 02:24:13,830
it was Ted Kennedy that was calling him 
a disgrace.

3236
02:24:13,860 --> 02:24:15,750
Like back in the 19 eighties.
Oh,

3237
02:24:15,751 --> 02:24:16,584
this guy was,
he was too racist to be a judge in the 

3238
02:24:20,611 --> 02:24:22,620
Reagan era,
you know,

3239
02:24:22,621 --> 02:24:23,454
and,
and I mean literally like Congress was 

3240
02:24:24,691 --> 02:24:25,261
like,
no,

3241
02:24:25,261 --> 02:24:27,540
like you're too,
you're too far gone.

3242
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:30,780
And he had,
this guy has a long history of crazy,

3243
02:24:30,920 --> 02:24:33,210
you know,
when he wants to bring back the just say

3244
02:24:33,211 --> 02:24:37,380
no days literally said that he wants to 
bring back the policy of just saying no.

3245
02:24:37,560 --> 02:24:39,510
And the war on drugs,
the war on drugs,

3246
02:24:39,511 --> 02:24:42,600
throwing people in jail forever,
just saying no.

3247
02:24:43,820 --> 02:24:46,290
And he's still living in the Nancy 
Reagan days.

3248
02:24:46,320 --> 02:24:47,370
Yeah.
It's amazing.

3249
02:24:47,400 --> 02:24:51,210
That was probably progressive for him.
You know what I mean?

3250
02:24:51,240 --> 02:24:52,800
That was,
that was a lot.

3251
02:24:52,950 --> 02:24:56,130
Yeah,
he's moved away from the far right.

3252
02:24:56,220 --> 02:25:00,180
He's one of those guys that like,
he wants it to be 1950.

3253
02:25:00,270 --> 02:25:01,500
Yeah,
that's his,

3254
02:25:01,501 --> 02:25:04,540
that's his dream.
He was in high school back then,

3255
02:25:05,070 --> 02:25:08,180
getting all the ladies know things were 
good and he wants you to be 1950.

3256
02:25:08,190 --> 02:25:10,050
That there were black people were 
segregated.

3257
02:25:10,051 --> 02:25:12,630
There were no Mexicans,
like Mexican didn't need.

3258
02:25:12,660 --> 02:25:14,510
It.
Didn't even exist in the 1950.

3259
02:25:14,700 --> 02:25:15,533
[inaudible] Ricardo was the only Latino 
in America and the jets and the jets in 

3260
02:25:21,301 --> 02:25:22,800
west side story.
It was crazy.

3261
02:25:22,801 --> 02:25:26,320
And Ricky Ricardo though was Cuban.
Cubans were completely respectable.

3262
02:25:26,321 --> 02:25:27,910
Yeah.
It was like a man from Spain,

3263
02:25:28,270 --> 02:25:29,103
like a man from Spain.
I come on over to America would be a 

3264
02:25:31,061 --> 02:25:32,260
Spanish gentleman.
Right.

3265
02:25:32,380 --> 02:25:33,700
You know,
it's like there's a difference.

3266
02:25:34,060 --> 02:25:36,160
When people started looking at Mexicans,
it was,

3267
02:25:36,161 --> 02:25:38,440
it became this different thing.
Cuba.

3268
02:25:38,441 --> 02:25:40,630
Cuba was Vegas.
Yeah.

3269
02:25:40,631 --> 02:25:41,464
It was big as my dad was around in that 
era when Cuba was where you went to a 

3270
02:25:45,611 --> 02:25:48,040
vacation and gambling at all.

3271
02:25:48,130 --> 02:25:50,170
Yeah.
I must have been weird times,

3272
02:25:50,171 --> 02:25:50,730
Huh?
Yeah.

3273
02:25:50,730 --> 02:25:51,563
That had to be crazy,
but they still have the cars from back 

3274
02:25:54,251 --> 02:25:57,010
then and they keep them running with 
anything.

3275
02:25:57,250 --> 02:25:58,240
Anything that,
you know,

3276
02:25:58,510 --> 02:25:59,343
you talk about engineers like can you 
imagine if today you still had to keep 

3277
02:26:03,221 --> 02:26:08,221
it 1953 chevy running with like,
you know what I'm like,

3278
02:26:09,281 --> 02:26:10,870
Oh,
you might think you're creative,

3279
02:26:11,200 --> 02:26:12,033
but here's a 1953 Chevy,
half of a boat engine and a lawn mower 

3280
02:26:17,560 --> 02:26:18,393
like this.
This is literally the professor from 

3281
02:26:20,081 --> 02:26:23,070
Gilligan's island where you just like 
you,

3282
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:26,290
you just make shit work.
Remember that show?

3283
02:26:26,350 --> 02:26:28,120
They remember macgyver.
They don't remember.

3284
02:26:28,121 --> 02:26:28,954
The professor from Gilligan's island was
the original Makoto professor used to 

3285
02:26:32,350 --> 02:26:37,180
make machines out of bananas and Palm 
Show today.

3286
02:26:37,181 --> 02:26:40,290
Everybody will be fucking.
Nobody fucked up then.

3287
02:26:40,840 --> 02:26:41,673
Nothing ever happened on TV.
Ginger would just always have makeup on 

3288
02:26:43,691 --> 02:26:46,560
it for everybody.
She had heels and a dress on,

3289
02:26:46,561 --> 02:26:47,620
on this.
Smart people.

3290
02:26:47,621 --> 02:26:51,160
Look at Marianne.
I want Marianne's the move.

3291
02:26:51,190 --> 02:26:53,470
That's the move.
He want her.

3292
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:56,080
She's like low key.
She's probably freaking bad,

3293
02:26:56,081 --> 02:26:59,650
but it's just like she was probably 
banging Gilligan.

3294
02:26:59,800 --> 02:27:00,640
You think so?
Yeah.

3295
02:27:01,120 --> 02:27:02,530
In real life or could.
No,

3296
02:27:02,590 --> 02:27:05,320
you pick up the professor and the 
skipper.

3297
02:27:05,321 --> 02:27:08,130
We're fighting over ginger all the time.
Right?

3298
02:27:08,180 --> 02:27:11,550
Then the hollows had each other.
So Maryann,

3299
02:27:11,560 --> 02:27:12,370
she just,
you know,

3300
02:27:12,370 --> 02:27:15,130
slip in and out on Gilligan.
What about skipper?

3301
02:27:15,520 --> 02:27:16,360
That port?
Fuck.

3302
02:27:16,840 --> 02:27:17,673
Skip bridges.

3303
02:27:18,390 --> 02:27:21,750
Bizarre attacks in Havana.
Hit us by networking Cuba.

3304
02:27:21,780 --> 02:27:22,570
What does that.

3305
02:27:22,570 --> 02:27:25,790
I typed in this.
I was looking at recent news,

3306
02:27:25,791 --> 02:27:27,830
and this is coming out like yesterday,
attack acts

3307
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:31,000
and US personnel and Havana.
What is this?

3308
02:27:31,810 --> 02:27:32,643
What's happening to them?
Spies posted to the embassy under 

3309
02:27:35,771 --> 02:27:39,280
diplomatic cover reported hearing.
Bizarre sounds experiencing.

3310
02:27:39,610 --> 02:27:41,860
Oh,
this was a audio attacks,

3311
02:27:41,861 --> 02:27:44,500
right?
The there were hitting them with sound.

3312
02:27:44,501 --> 02:27:45,334
Oh Shit.
Sorry.

3313
02:27:45,540 --> 02:27:46,373
That happened.
I'm experiencing even stranger physical 

3314
02:27:48,491 --> 02:27:50,260
effects.
The United States realized something was

3315
02:27:50,261 --> 02:27:51,094
wrong.
Individuals familiar with the situation 

3316
02:27:52,751 --> 02:27:53,710
said,
yeah,

3317
02:27:53,711 --> 02:27:54,544
they were using some sonic weapon 
started within days of President Donald 

3318
02:28:00,100 --> 02:28:03,520
Trump's surprise election in November.
Surprise election.

3319
02:28:04,660 --> 02:28:08,140
Okay.
The precise timeline or remains unclear,

3320
02:28:08,141 --> 02:28:08,974
including whether intelligent officer 
intelligence officers with the first 

3321
02:28:11,591 --> 02:28:14,200
victims hit or merely the first victims 
to report it,

3322
02:28:14,260 --> 02:28:17,500
us has called the situation ongoing.
To date,

3323
02:28:17,501 --> 02:28:21,160
the Trumpet Administration largely has 
described the 21 victims.

3324
02:28:21,170 --> 02:28:21,980
Wow.
At

3325
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:25,760
the US embassy personnel or members of 
the diplomatic community.

3326
02:28:26,150 --> 02:28:26,983
That description suggested only bonafide
diplomats in their family members were 

3327
02:28:30,681 --> 02:28:35,210
struck with no logical motivation beyond
disrupting us Cuban relations.

3328
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:36,433
Yeah.
It was some sort of seemed to not even 

3329
02:28:37,791 --> 02:28:42,791
describing what kind of attack it is.
Some kind of scroll down here.

3330
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:44,113
The first disturbing reports of piercing
high pitch noises and inexplicably 

3331
02:28:48,410 --> 02:28:52,910
ailments pointed to someone deliberately
targeting the US government intelligence

3332
02:28:52,911 --> 02:28:53,744
network on the communist run island and 
what seems like a bone chilling 

3333
02:28:56,901 --> 02:28:57,734
escalation of the tit for tat spy games 
the Washington van have waged over the 

3334
02:29:04,190 --> 02:29:05,220
last half century.
Know there's an end for me.

3335
02:29:05,250 --> 02:29:06,560
New Year's.
Interesting.

3336
02:29:06,680 --> 02:29:08,660
Have you ever heard of the Brown note?
What's that?

3337
02:29:09,590 --> 02:29:11,600
I was thought that maybe it was getting 
at this,

3338
02:29:11,601 --> 02:29:13,130
but I don't even know if it's actually 
real,

3339
02:29:13,131 --> 02:29:13,964
but it sounds like it's real.
It's a sonic note that can be used 

3340
02:29:17,421 --> 02:29:19,820
supposedly weaponized to make someone 
and shit themselves.

3341
02:29:20,010 --> 02:29:20,843
Oh,
I did hear about that and I know when I 

3342
02:29:21,681 --> 02:29:23,600
was an audio school,
I remember we were asking the teacher if

3343
02:29:23,750 --> 02:29:25,930
you're going to,
if that's that a possibility or whatnot,

3344
02:29:25,940 --> 02:29:30,940
and I don't know if we ever got anywhere
realistic because it tested well.

3345
02:29:31,920 --> 02:29:36,920
I'm glad to hear it.
Oh,

3346
02:29:40,970 --> 02:29:43,490
because a human hearing stops at 20 
hertz,

3347
02:29:43,491 --> 02:29:45,500
which is a really low base and you can 
barely do.

3348
02:29:45,501 --> 02:29:48,890
You have to have really good hearing and
here that if you do a sound test,

3349
02:29:48,891 --> 02:29:52,580
someone will play that sound and it'll 
almost does sound like a pressure.

3350
02:29:52,760 --> 02:29:54,650
You'll feel like a pressure change in 
your head.

3351
02:29:54,740 --> 02:29:56,930
I have a friend who's ears are fucked 
up.

3352
02:29:56,931 --> 02:29:58,520
My friend John Dudley,
you know John Dudley,

3353
02:29:58,760 --> 02:29:59,593
his ears are fucked up from guns.
Like you shut a lot of guns and he was 

3354
02:30:01,791 --> 02:30:02,624
younger and he blew blues hearing out.
But so he has a hard time hearing 

3355
02:30:05,331 --> 02:30:10,160
certain things but he can hear really 
deep sounds way better than I can.

3356
02:30:10,190 --> 02:30:12,050
My hearing is good,
but he,

3357
02:30:12,080 --> 02:30:13,460
he's got like,
it's almost like,

3358
02:30:14,210 --> 02:30:15,043
you know,
when someone is blind they can hear 

3359
02:30:15,921 --> 02:30:17,180
better.
It's almost like that.

3360
02:30:17,210 --> 02:30:19,010
Like his,
his hearing is fucked up,

3361
02:30:19,011 --> 02:30:22,280
but certain notes penetrate that don't 
get me.

3362
02:30:22,440 --> 02:30:26,790
I think he can hear like,
like deep sounds like an animal grumping

3363
02:30:26,940 --> 02:30:27,950
like,
and he's like,

3364
02:30:27,951 --> 02:30:28,570
you hear that?
I'm like,

3365
02:30:28,570 --> 02:30:29,403
no.
Anything like you can hear shit that 

3366
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:33,320
most people can hear.
It's weird.

3367
02:30:33,370 --> 02:30:35,990
It's very weird because most of his 
sound is fucked up.

3368
02:30:36,630 --> 02:30:39,590
So he just.
Is that Brown note real?

3369
02:30:40,210 --> 02:30:42,770
That's why I was asking if you had ever 
heard of it or have heard of it.

3370
02:30:42,800 --> 02:30:43,633
That would be.
That would be your best and worst 

3371
02:30:45,141 --> 02:30:45,974
podcast over the brown note.
Mcast driving their cars just shitting 

3372
02:30:50,601 --> 02:30:52,550
themselves on the train.
Shit themselves.

3373
02:30:53,290 --> 02:30:55,320
Amazing,
but I hate it.

3374
02:30:55,890 --> 02:30:56,723
Yeah.
Imagine he played in the background of 

3375
02:30:57,921 --> 02:31:02,420
the most amazing podcasts ever.
Like you have some really cool person in

3376
02:31:02,421 --> 02:31:04,640
here.
Really interesting subject.

3377
02:31:04,641 --> 02:31:07,580
I remember mythbusters tried to do this 
and I think they used a really,

3378
02:31:07,581 --> 02:31:11,960
really big sound system to try to 
recreate this low frequency stuff.

3379
02:31:12,230 --> 02:31:13,063
Almost impossible to get and I think 
they didn't get very far because they 

3380
02:31:16,431 --> 02:31:18,290
don't have that government shit bro.
Stuff.

3381
02:31:18,291 --> 02:31:20,040
They use it in Cuba.
Maybe that's what's

3382
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:21,780
going on.
Those people shitting themselves,

3383
02:31:21,990 --> 02:31:23,190
they just don't want to say it.
That's what I did.

3384
02:31:23,191 --> 02:31:24,690
I was hoping it would say something like
that.

3385
02:31:25,540 --> 02:31:27,870
Yeah.
I wonder what the sonic attack is like.

3386
02:31:27,990 --> 02:31:30,300
Do they pointed out you?
You can have that.

3387
02:31:30,301 --> 02:31:33,480
I know for sure.
The speakers that can be taken literally

3388
02:31:33,481 --> 02:31:35,930
pointed at you like across the street 
and press a button.

3389
02:31:35,940 --> 02:31:38,490
It's the sounds going right out and 
fucking with your inherent.

3390
02:31:38,520 --> 02:31:38,710
Yeah.

3391
02:31:38,710 --> 02:31:41,620
Will sound it's directional.
So that absolutely makes sense.

3392
02:31:41,680 --> 02:31:43,900
Yeah.
How weird is that?

3393
02:31:43,901 --> 02:31:45,430
That they're doing?
Who's doing that?

3394
02:31:46,140 --> 02:31:48,940
Must be someone in the Cuban government.
Doesn't want us over there.

3395
02:31:48,941 --> 02:31:52,750
It was just to fuck with the uh,
just to fuck with the diplomat.

3396
02:31:52,840 --> 02:31:53,673
The Yankee spies.
They said that is something that's 

3397
02:31:55,091 --> 02:31:55,924
always going on.
And just little games they play with 

3398
02:31:57,341 --> 02:31:58,174
each other.

3399
02:31:58,390 --> 02:32:00,150
Yeah.
This says they couldn't even get in here

3400
02:32:00,151 --> 02:32:02,160
where they couldn't even hear him.
They just weren't.

3401
02:32:02,161 --> 02:32:04,860
And they weren't even aware of an attack
does later they had symptoms.

3402
02:32:05,540 --> 02:32:07,680
Oh Wow.
Probably a little bit headache,

3403
02:32:08,880 --> 02:32:10,350
I would imagine.
Yeah.

3404
02:32:11,150 --> 02:32:14,250
How the boy magic that gets into the 
wrong hands.

3405
02:32:14,430 --> 02:32:15,930
What if that becomes like a,
you know,

3406
02:32:15,950 --> 02:32:16,783
technology gets into the hands of 
regular people eventually like tasers 

3407
02:32:19,051 --> 02:32:21,660
and shake.
You just go by a Taser or had you get by

3408
02:32:21,661 --> 02:32:24,150
some sound shit and just pointed at your
neighbor while he's mowing the lawn.

3409
02:32:24,450 --> 02:32:29,450
Art Give me know if the MP is an emp,
a real threat to America or whatever.

3410
02:32:29,611 --> 02:32:30,444
Like a matrix style,
emp wipes out all of the electronics 

3411
02:32:34,020 --> 02:32:39,020
area with it as a natural solar blasts,
any sort of solar flare.

3412
02:32:39,630 --> 02:32:40,530
I mean there's,
there's,

3413
02:32:40,560 --> 02:32:45,450
there's a massive potential for solar 
interrupt and interruption of our entire

3414
02:32:45,451 --> 02:32:46,284
power grid,
like some massive solar flare happens 

3415
02:32:48,541 --> 02:32:52,130
and just cooks all of our satellites.
The entire power grid.

3416
02:32:52,170 --> 02:32:53,610
We have to start from scratch.
We're down.

3417
02:32:53,820 --> 02:32:54,653
No power.

3418
02:32:55,020 --> 02:32:56,540
The emp.
Whoa.

3419
02:32:56,550 --> 02:32:59,850
We're in Puerto Rico.
BNP is real,

3420
02:32:59,851 --> 02:33:04,200
but I think you have to create so much 
power to have one that big.

3421
02:33:04,620 --> 02:33:06,360
I think that's,
that's the limiting

3422
02:33:06,870 --> 02:33:09,000
factor on it.
I had a guy in here,

3423
02:33:09,001 --> 02:33:11,070
Peter Schiff was here.
What does this day,

3424
02:33:11,071 --> 02:33:11,904
this son brought darkness back.
There was a blackout caused by solar 

3425
02:33:15,631 --> 02:33:17,460
flare.
There was in the nineties,

3426
02:33:17,520 --> 02:33:18,590
89.
Oh,

3427
02:33:18,600 --> 02:33:21,300
okay.
The entire province of Quebec,

3428
02:33:21,301 --> 02:33:23,670
Canada suffered an electrical power 
blackout.

3429
02:33:23,671 --> 02:33:24,504
Hundreds of blackouts occurred and some 
parts of North America every year they 

3430
02:33:27,001 --> 02:33:30,690
go back back out was different because 
this one was caused by a solar storm.

3431
02:33:30,720 --> 02:33:33,090
Yeah.
Apparently like what we're,

3432
02:33:33,091 --> 02:33:33,924
what we've tracked so far in terms of 
solar activity is just a tiny fraction 

3433
02:33:38,731 --> 02:33:39,564
of what the sun is capable of and the 
sun is capable of some pretty wild 

3434
02:33:42,391 --> 02:33:47,391
variations and if those wild variations,
if it hits like a real odd end,

3435
02:33:48,270 --> 02:33:50,690
it could just fuck her entire system 
though.

3436
02:33:50,780 --> 02:33:53,180
Well,
we're at the mercy of nature always,

3437
02:33:53,210 --> 02:33:54,043
you know,
no matter how big our egos get over our 

3438
02:33:57,530 --> 02:33:59,720
creations,
what we build,

3439
02:34:00,200 --> 02:34:02,180
nature's like a,
you know,

3440
02:34:02,450 --> 02:34:04,580
a wipe that shit out in a minute.
You know what I mean?

3441
02:34:04,581 --> 02:34:06,620
Like there's no.
I used to do a joke about that.

3442
02:34:06,621 --> 02:34:08,360
Like oh look at my beach house.

3443
02:34:08,710 --> 02:34:09,543
She tells us I stayed at one for awhile 
and at nighttime it reveals itself in 

3444
02:34:16,101 --> 02:34:16,934
the daytime.
It looks.

3445
02:34:17,590 --> 02:34:18,070
Look at all that

3446
02:34:18,070 --> 02:34:20,230
beautiful blue water.
It's amazing.

3447
02:34:20,270 --> 02:34:25,270
So pretty the ocean at night it is a 
black munster space.

3448
02:34:28,210 --> 02:34:31,000
It's a dark monster because you don't 
see anything and you realize like,

3449
02:34:31,001 --> 02:34:31,834
oh,
that is fucking quadrillions of gallons 

3450
02:34:34,451 --> 02:34:35,284
of water.
That could just swallow up the entire 

3451
02:34:36,671 --> 02:34:38,890
city.
Tons of weight and pressure,

3452
02:34:39,190 --> 02:34:41,320
you know,
like snow,

3453
02:34:41,410 --> 02:34:42,900
snow is the same way,
you know,

3454
02:34:43,090 --> 02:34:46,750
just shut everything down.
Just a major snowfall,

3455
02:34:46,990 --> 02:34:47,823
but you don't live next to snow.
That's the fucked up thing about living 

3456
02:34:49,841 --> 02:34:52,330
next to the ocean as a.
you're literally on the edge,

3457
02:34:52,570 --> 02:34:55,240
but you can live in one of those places 
that gets hit with,

3458
02:34:55,530 --> 02:34:57,160
you know,
10 feet of snow,

3459
02:34:57,730 --> 02:34:59,890
12 feet of snow and you're screwed.
Yeah.

3460
02:34:59,891 --> 02:35:02,020
But you could see that shit coming and 
get out of dodge,

3461
02:35:02,440 --> 02:35:03,273
but we don't know.
It's crazy because the rich people live 

3462
02:35:07,451 --> 02:35:10,270
on the edge.
That's the same thing with earthquakes.

3463
02:35:10,390 --> 02:35:12,540
I told my mom a long time ago like she'd
be,

3464
02:35:12,580 --> 02:35:13,420
are you okay?
I said,

3465
02:35:13,421 --> 02:35:14,254
mom,
let's hope one day I make enough money 

3466
02:35:16,150 --> 02:35:19,620
to live somewhere I have to worry about,
you know,

3467
02:35:19,690 --> 02:35:22,270
fires or you know what I mean?
Like I live in the valley.

3468
02:35:22,271 --> 02:35:23,104
I'm fine.
Like I wish I wish I had to worry about 

3469
02:35:25,481 --> 02:35:26,650
fires,
but you keep water,

3470
02:35:26,660 --> 02:35:30,010
snow brush clearing a little bit.
Now I don't have a full kit.

3471
02:35:30,011 --> 02:35:33,850
I have a Red Cross kit and a couple of 
gallons of water.

3472
02:35:33,851 --> 02:35:36,670
But um,
I'm gonna I'm gonna expand on that.

3473
02:35:37,150 --> 02:35:40,180
I have some food,
some freeze dried food.

3474
02:35:40,480 --> 02:35:41,313
You know,
a guy who went through Katrina told me 

3475
02:35:43,450 --> 02:35:45,040
cash,
cash.

3476
02:35:45,310 --> 02:35:46,143
He said keep cash in the house.
He said after Katrina milk was $100 a 

3477
02:35:49,241 --> 02:35:51,220
gallon.
100.

3478
02:35:51,390 --> 02:35:53,530
Uh,
well yeah.

3479
02:35:53,531 --> 02:35:54,364
He said you got to keep a large sum of 
cash in the house as part of your 

3480
02:35:57,461 --> 02:35:59,400
disaster kit.
Something I never would have thought.

3481
02:35:59,440 --> 02:36:00,100
But you said,
yeah,

3482
02:36:00,100 --> 02:36:03,840
there's a disaster.
The price of everything goes up and cash

3483
02:36:03,841 --> 02:36:04,674
is the only currency.
Like you can't use credit cards if 

3484
02:36:07,241 --> 02:36:08,074
there's no electricity.
Wasn't there an issue in Houston where 

3485
02:36:09,671 --> 02:36:12,860
people are getting arrested for price 
gouging on water and yeah,

3486
02:36:12,910 --> 02:36:14,220
they were charging.
I don't know.

3487
02:36:14,430 --> 02:36:15,263
What was it?
90 bucks a case I think for water and 

3488
02:36:17,590 --> 02:36:19,690
$100 a gallon for gas or something.

3489
02:36:21,870 --> 02:36:26,110
It's human nature.
What are you going to do with us?

3490
02:36:26,730 --> 02:36:28,720
I wish we can wrap this up on a nice 
note,

3491
02:36:29,010 --> 02:36:30,690
but I gotta I gotta end this.
Alright.

3492
02:36:30,700 --> 02:36:32,270
Anything good to say to people?
Uh,

3493
02:36:32,560 --> 02:36:33,341
yeah,
yeah.

3494
02:36:33,341 --> 02:36:36,770
Be Be Nice to be nice to people.
You know what bothers.

3495
02:36:36,820 --> 02:36:37,653
No,
seriously.

3496
02:36:38,520 --> 02:36:40,870
This is a little thing,
but you know what bothers me.

3497
02:36:41,500 --> 02:36:42,910
Don't.
If you're in the elevated throw,

3498
02:36:42,920 --> 02:36:44,170
hit the door.
Close button.

3499
02:36:44,590 --> 02:36:46,550
Yeah,
button.

3500
02:36:46,730 --> 02:36:50,080
It's just an asshole.
There's no time that door closed.

3501
02:36:50,081 --> 02:36:51,580
That's an asshole.
Move.

3502
02:36:51,640 --> 02:36:52,473
People like it though.
They like to press that button to see 

3503
02:36:53,590 --> 02:36:55,080
someone almost held there,
but hold on.

3504
02:36:55,120 --> 02:36:56,680
Oh,
you went away that.

3505
02:36:56,770 --> 02:36:58,600
That's how I'm.
That's how I'm changing the world,

3506
02:36:58,601 --> 02:36:59,710
Joe.
That's how I'm cheap.

3507
02:36:59,730 --> 02:37:01,840
Listen,
I can't solve gun violence.

3508
02:37:02,200 --> 02:37:03,033
I can't.
I can't help with the football protests 

3509
02:37:04,631 --> 02:37:05,464
or anything,
but if you can just not press the door 

3510
02:37:07,751 --> 02:37:09,280
close button.
It's a start.

3511
02:37:09,460 --> 02:37:10,293
But there are some dumb motherfuckers 
with like four kids when the elevator's 

3512
02:37:14,051 --> 02:37:16,100
completely packed,
like hold the door,

3513
02:37:16,190 --> 02:37:17,950
hold the door.
Like where are you going?

3514
02:37:17,970 --> 02:37:19,280
No,
you are you going?

3515
02:37:19,390 --> 02:37:20,223
Where are you going?
And if your kid presses every button on 

3516
02:37:22,641 --> 02:37:25,610
the elevator and he accidentally takes 
one to the head,

3517
02:37:25,880 --> 02:37:27,710
we can't be held responsible.
See?

3518
02:37:28,070 --> 02:37:28,903
See,
I'm not saying that he's had his elbow 

3519
02:37:30,561 --> 02:37:31,394
height.
We're just moving that saying that got 

3520
02:37:33,111 --> 02:37:36,020
in the way of just saying,
stay away from the door closed,

3521
02:37:36,021 --> 02:37:37,310
but don't.
Plus that door.

3522
02:37:37,370 --> 02:37:38,600
Close button.
Nice gentlemen.

3523
02:37:38,830 --> 02:37:41,540
That's a strong advice from Alonzo 
Bowden.

3524
02:37:41,800 --> 02:37:44,930
It's the wings of a butterfly and 
eventually become a hurricane.

3525
02:37:46,050 --> 02:37:48,740
You letting someone in that elevator 
might change the course of history.

3526
02:37:48,950 --> 02:37:52,610
Think about it.
It's like when Peter Parker left,

3527
02:37:52,611 --> 02:37:55,160
that burglar passed by and it killed his
uncle Ben.

3528
02:37:55,460 --> 02:37:57,200
Boom.
Then the tournament of Spiderman.

3529
02:37:57,201 --> 02:37:58,060
Exactly.
Yeah.

3530
02:37:58,640 --> 02:38:00,050
Alright.
Strong words.

3531
02:38:00,200 --> 02:38:01,810
I like it.
Both ladies.

3532
02:38:01,830 --> 02:38:03,320
Gentlemen begs.
Thank you brother.
