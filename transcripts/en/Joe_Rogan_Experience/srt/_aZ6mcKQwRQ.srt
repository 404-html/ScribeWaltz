1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:01,681
Okay.

2
00:00:01,681 --> 00:00:02,660
We're alive.

3
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,573
What's up dude?

4
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,370
I'm doing fantastic referendums,

5
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:06,061
ladies and gentlemen.

6
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:06,790
What the fuck?

7
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:07,470
Yeah.

8
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:07,931
Hey Buddy.

9
00:00:07,931 --> 00:00:08,201
Hey,

10
00:00:08,201 --> 00:00:09,180
a meeting.

11
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,250
If you told me six,

12
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:15,660
seven years ago that I was going to be
on the Joe Rogan podcast or the Joe Rogan

13
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:16,800
show out,

14
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,120
I told you no way in hell.

15
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:18,421
Well,

16
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:19,081
it didn't exist.

17
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:20,170
So that's,

18
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,290
you go to Colorado.

19
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:23,220
You don't have to find me.

20
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,081
You'd have to go,

21
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:25,441
dude,

22
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:26,250
I got an idea.

23
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,083
Yeah.

24
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,640
There's this thing called podcasting.

25
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,550
You're going to love it,

26
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,690
but there's no way I would've thought
I would be doing this either six,

27
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:34,321
seven years ago.

28
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:35,550
So we're in the same boat.

29
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,151
Love it,

30
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:36,480
man.

31
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:36,781
There you go,

32
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:37,614
man.

33
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,030
And now did you like we
were talking to Pacquiao,

34
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,060
Mayweather fight before we,

35
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:42,890
before we came on air.

36
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:43,723
Uh,

37
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,700
did you actually watch it?

38
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:45,420
Yes.

39
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:45,720
Yeah,

40
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,730
I watched it as a fight guy.

41
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,420
What a,

42
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,370
what were your thoughts on it?

43
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,460
I'm sure you've covered this already,

44
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:52,770
so I'm sorry if you're going
to make you repeat things,

45
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,350
you know,

46
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,660
I'm not in the minority.

47
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,740
I actually enjoyed it.

48
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,260
I really,

49
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:56,640
yeah,

50
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,640
I enjoyed it from like a
technical standpoint and if
like two guys who are the

51
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:04,680
best in the world trying
to figure each other out.

52
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:05,490
Yeah.

53
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:08,250
And now do you think that as a
guy that knows the fight game,

54
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:12,480
you can respect defense more
than your average fight fan?

55
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,950
We'll definitely more than my wife.

56
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,031
Oh my God.

57
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:16,410
She was saying some retarded shit.

58
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,280
She was,

59
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,490
she was saying you should have to
get knocked down in order to win.

60
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,241
I go,

61
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:22,530
what are you talking about?

62
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:22,801
She goes,

63
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:24,420
that's that way it would
at least be exciting.

64
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,480
So like make them go for
guaranteed concussion,

65
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,300
satellite Charon,

66
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,030
shit like that.

67
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,260
Like,

68
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,470
so ridiculous.

69
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,920
It's like hearing like some
people like I kinda get it.

70
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,200
She's not a fight fan like silver,

71
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:37,861
her watching it,

72
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:39,100
it's just boring as fuck.

73
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:41,400
Cause just two dudes
not hitting each other.

74
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,230
And then when one dude
gets close to the do,

75
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,020
grabs him,

76
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,740
you know?

77
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:44,930
Yeah.

78
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:45,200
Like,

79
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,640
uh,

80
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,020
I,

81
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,150
I love watching hockey on TV.

82
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,370
That's like my favorite
sport to watch on TV.

83
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:55,110
And hockey is notoriously awful
right on TV and people hate it on TV.

84
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,430
I love it because I played for
like five years when I was a kid.

85
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,430
So like I recognize that
they're setting up plays,

86
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:05,400
I recognize strategies
and stuff like that.

87
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:08,040
So what I'm trying to explain to people
and there's like this is stupid or not

88
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:08,431
scoring,

89
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:10,990
I can't follow the puck
and I'm trying to like,

90
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,150
I'm trying to tell them the ins and outs
of it and I'm sure the fight game is

91
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:15,930
like that for you.

92
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,200
Do they still have that thing where they
follow the puck like a with a circle or

93
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,450
they try them for a while.

94
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,140
Not that on Fox it was like,

95
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:24,240
and it turns slap shots into a comet.

96
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:25,160
Like it.

97
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,110
Like it just had this
like red trail behind it.

98
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,621
Really?

99
00:02:28,621 --> 00:02:29,071
Yeah.

100
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:29,904
And like it was,

101
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,540
it was supposed to get like
the casual fan into it,

102
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:38,220
but it's like no one is going to hate
hockey and then see a comet trail on the

103
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:38,671
puck and go,

104
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:39,570
well now I'm in,

105
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,430
I got this now.

106
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:41,611
Well,

107
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:43,920
they've done some weird shit
like that with football,

108
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:44,221
right,

109
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:49,221
with graphics and all the amazing part
is that I was a huge fan of the XFL.

110
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,090
If people remember the Xfl,

111
00:02:51,091 --> 00:02:52,620
that was Vince Mcmahon's thing.

112
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,440
And then a lot of the
stuff that they did are,

113
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,100
is now being implemented into the NFL.

114
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:58,800
What kinds of stuff?

115
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,800
Like the overhead camera that is like on
strings and that follows the game from

116
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:05,134
the top.

117
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,190
That was XFL.

118
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,080
Uh,

119
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,690
thou,

120
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,980
thou is XFL before,

121
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:09,410
uh,

122
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,550
trying to make a,

123
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,350
I mean they tried to make kickoffs more
exciting until like all the concussion

124
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:15,580
stuff came out.

125
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,181
But yeah,

126
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:19,720
like there's a few things
and certainly making it more,

127
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:25,050
Vince at least recognized that it would
be more fun if there was like complex

128
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:29,740
storylines and like you knew like the
soap opera of it much like he did for

129
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:30,430
wrestling.

130
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,870
So now you see the NFL and it's
the world's greatest reality show.

131
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,470
Like they,

132
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:40,120
like they follow the guys off the field
and like they get into their lives and

133
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:44,680
now it's what the Xfl was where like
they're trying to build up rivalries and

134
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:47,500
you know what players actually don't like
each other and who slept with who his

135
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:48,940
wife and things like that.

136
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,181
You know,

137
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:51,370
the problem with getting
into the NFL life,

138
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:53,500
like getting into the
player's life is like,

139
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:58,320
you're trying to pretend that these guys
are not the savage gladiators who were

140
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,550
just smashing people every day.

141
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:00,880
Yeah.

142
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,620
And you want them like off field to be
like the sweeties like baking pies and

143
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:06,550
hugging their kids.

144
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:06,881
Know.

145
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:09,610
It's like you don't get
a guy like Ray Lewis.

146
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:10,060
Yeah.

147
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,870
Without Him.

148
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,370
Like did you see the video of him
pleading to the people of Baltimore going,

149
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:15,640
no,

150
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,590
violence is not the answer.

151
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,221
And he's like,

152
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:18,971
whole life dude.

153
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:19,700
He's so intense.

154
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,110
Like yet.

155
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:20,501
Okay.

156
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:21,930
So if violence isn't the answer,

157
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,960
move out of your mansion.

158
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:25,870
Cause that's what built
the mansion was violence.

159
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:26,890
People know who you are.

160
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,220
Yeah.

161
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,180
You're super violent.

162
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:28,990
Yeah.

163
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,560
That's like,

164
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,790
that's like you and me saying like,

165
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:31,601
don't tell jokes.

166
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:32,050
Yeah.

167
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,300
Stop it wasn't he on trial for murder?

168
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,650
I mean that's been violent,

169
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,930
but he didn't really do it.

170
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:41,110
It was like one of his entourage and
he was an a or allegedly accessory to

171
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:41,944
murder was college.

172
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,780
It was kind of like the snoop Dogg thing,

173
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,970
right?

174
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:45,450
Yeah.

175
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:45,910
Yeah.

176
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,860
Either way he's a football player.

177
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:48,710
Like,

178
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,780
like when you see like these fighters
are these football players and see them

179
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:56,170
doing ridiculous shit and
people get all surprised.

180
00:04:56,171 --> 00:05:00,490
It's like you can't ask them to be
anything other than what they really are.

181
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,001
Exactly.

182
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,380
You want that result.

183
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,360
You write that ray rice result,

184
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,010
you're going to get a ray rice,

185
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,900
you're going to get that happening.

186
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,090
Which is,

187
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:09,370
yeah.

188
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,980
Which is not saying we condone it.

189
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,300
I don't know.

190
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,150
But it's just saying don't be
surprised when it happened,

191
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:14,741
but you can't.

192
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:18,670
All the sudden and 2015 start
putting cameras on these guys,

193
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,060
following him around and expecting
them to have exemplary behavior.

194
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,240
What they're good at is when
the fucking place starts.

195
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,830
They're good at getting shit done,

196
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,730
you know,

197
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,250
and the way you do that
is through violence,

198
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:32,470
explosive athleticism,

199
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,750
smashing in it.

200
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:38,620
Thanks fucking diving through
mounds of enormous steroid it up,

201
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:39,011
dude.

202
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:39,281
Yeah.

203
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:43,450
And then with so much testosterone
boiling over and then when Richard Sherman

204
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:46,810
gives an interview late last year or
two or two years ago when he was like,

205
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,180
what the crap she can be put on me,

206
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:49,631
crap,

207
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:50,464
she's a punk.

208
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,240
Then they start getting mad at him.

209
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:53,170
Like how?

210
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,740
How dare you talk to
Erin Andrews like that?

211
00:05:56,741 --> 00:05:57,070
Oh,

212
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,380
oh,

213
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,440
petite white woman and
you're just getting angry.

214
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:01,550
Why are you so angry?

215
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,760
Because he just play football for an hour.

216
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,700
That's why he's angry and that's
why he's good at what he does.

217
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah.

218
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,330
The idea that you wanted Tim to take it
from 10 all the way down to one again

219
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,200
and then just like come off like
he's an Oscar Wylde play like,

220
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:15,711
well that's be,

221
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:16,750
we're all in the field of battle.

222
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,880
Might I tell you it was
quite an interesting route.

223
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:20,570
That one.

224
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,340
Now it's not going to
happen though those guys,

225
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,600
those guys are going to be too intense.

226
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,560
It's not fair.

227
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,940
I mean it's,

228
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,250
everybody wants everything sanitized.

229
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:29,300
I mean we want to make,

230
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,610
we want the purity of the sport,

231
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:34,760
but then we also want
it to be fan friendly.

232
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:39,380
We also want it to be easily absorbed
by the casual person who's watching it.

233
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:39,620
Yeah.

234
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,210
And you know this because you've had to
interview guys right after they fight.

235
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,260
They're fired up after they've just
been punched in the face and they are,

236
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,290
and that's literally the most testosterone
probably that can run through your

237
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:55,090
body in a three minute period just
like getting revved up and then you,

238
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,160
and then Joe Rogan comes in and puts a
microphone and explain what happened out

239
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:02,690
there and then you will like,

240
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,290
they expect these guys to
get like a complex thing.

241
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,660
People wonder why athletes,

242
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,600
they get mad that they always
have those textbook answers.

243
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:13,130
Like one game at a time.

244
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,000
I was just doing a play.

245
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,160
It played a time where you'd
go back and work examine,

246
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:21,440
they have those scripted answers so they
don't have to think about giving those

247
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,140
answers because they
can't in those moments.

248
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,160
Well not only that,

249
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,360
a lot of people are just not
that good talking on camera.

250
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,530
Like that's something you've
got to get relaxed at.

251
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,270
We forget because we talk for a
living and that's what our normal is.

252
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,080
Our normal is talking in front of a
bunch of strangers and being funny on a

253
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:40,040
moment's notice,

254
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,310
rather be in an interview or
a radio show or a podcast,

255
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:43,581
whatever,

256
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:43,761
just,

257
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:44,090
hey,

258
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:44,780
flip the switch.

259
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,310
Go.

260
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:45,980
Right.

261
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,470
The average person does not do that.

262
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Like when they have an actor give a
speech at an awards show and it's like

263
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,880
something crazy happens and
they have to be spontaneous.

264
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,810
It's like no,

265
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,800
they're actors.

266
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,600
A lot of times they can't do that.

267
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:00,501
Yeah.

268
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:01,430
A lot of them can.

269
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:02,211
And some of them can.

270
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:05,960
Like one of the best interviews ever
was Mickey Rourke when he won some like

271
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:08,120
Golden Globe or one of those fucking,

272
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,493
whatever the name of you.

273
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,670
I think all wars are stupid.

274
00:08:10,671 --> 00:08:12,020
I don't pay attention to any of that shit.

275
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,410
You award far faked it
better than this faker.

276
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,690
But I mean now people
do great performance,

277
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:18,951
but his,

278
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:19,160
uh,

279
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:24,160
he did this amazing speech where he was
just so loose and relaxed talking all

280
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:25,400
kinds of crazy shit.

281
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:27,740
It was like one of the best
speeches ever and it was,

282
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:32,060
it was fun cause he seemed
like real comfortable in
his own skin despite all the

283
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:34,250
craziness of that guy has
been through and yeah.

284
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,263
Yeah.

285
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,290
It's always,

286
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,020
and that can go either way.

287
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:43,370
Like people either freak out with the
honesty of that person or that were where

288
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:44,690
it's really refreshing.

289
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,410
Uh,

290
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:45,720
is,

291
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:45,961
is,

292
00:08:45,961 --> 00:08:46,794
is this,

293
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,100
is that it was a spirit of beard award,

294
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,701
so it wasn't me.

295
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:51,590
It was really what's really crazy too.

296
00:08:51,591 --> 00:08:56,100
It's like you see him in this video and
we'll play a little bit of it and then

297
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,970
you see him now.

298
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:58,770
Like now he looks like an old gypsy woman.

299
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:03,360
He's got a crazy doctors face up and
it's actually an image that says chips

300
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:04,711
Mickey Rourke,

301
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,670
old Gypsy woman.

302
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:06,960
And that's exactly what it looks like.

303
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:07,800
Listen to some of this.

304
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,380
Thank you all very much.

305
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:10,881
Like look,

306
00:09:10,881 --> 00:09:11,631
he's so happy.

307
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:12,260
Yeah.

308
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,270
I just want to say one
thing about Eric Roberts.

309
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,230
Eric Roberts is probably the
best actor I've ever worked with.

310
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,070
And I don't,

311
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,160
I don't know why in the last 15 years,

312
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:26,510
ain't nobody give him a chance to show
his shit again because whatever he did

313
00:09:26,511 --> 00:09:26,991
15,

314
00:09:26,991 --> 00:09:28,760
20 years ago should be forgiven.

315
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,143
And I wish,

316
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,413
no,

317
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:31,830
um,

318
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,280
God damn series about that.

319
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,020
Eric Roberts is the fucking man.

320
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,233
Love it.

321
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,990
That's just one part of it.

322
00:09:38,991 --> 00:09:39,610
And he gets loose

323
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:39,990
slightly.

324
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,141
Yeah,

325
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:40,974
I have.

326
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:41,931
He didn't like,

327
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:42,651
I like God,

328
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:43,484
God,

329
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,000
he deserves a second chance.

330
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,510
And I wish there'd be one goddamn
film maker in this room that would,

331
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,880
would let him fly because the man,

332
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,290
he is something else.

333
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,681
Thank you,

334
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:53,514
Eric.

335
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,590
Eric will probably be arrested
by the end of the day,

336
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:02,540
but uh,

337
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,733
anyway,

338
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,983
um,

339
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,140
and that little blonde
dude that did that thing,

340
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:08,250
I'm going to beat erasure.

341
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,203
I get Outta here.

342
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,340
Well,

343
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:11,561
you're right.

344
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:12,080
He's very loose.

345
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,300
See,

346
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:12,841
she's like,

347
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:14,350
whatever nice to be presented,

348
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,240
it gets better.

349
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,710
Like he gets down to three.

350
00:10:17,711 --> 00:10:18,380
I don't know what you do,

351
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:18,760
honey.

352
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,100
These two are really good.

353
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:21,843
Really good.

354
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:22,943
Uh,

355
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,413
and uh,

356
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:27,670
you know,

357
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,150
uh,

358
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,330
I,

359
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,110
I've just gotten it

360
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,030
thousands of letters
it shed from my people,

361
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,820
strangers and people that know me about,

362
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,580
about my dog that died six days ago.

363
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,540
Loki.

364
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,373
Hello.

365
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:39,770
Okay.

366
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:43,040
Is what people who don't have kids do
you get all torn up about their dogs.

367
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:43,923
Right.

368
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,240
And I just got done talking to the
Santa Monica Police Department.

369
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:50,570
They gave me a bed to sleep
in 10 years ago and uh,

370
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,650
I thank them for,

371
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,020
I absent for two pillows
they told me to fuck off.

372
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:54,854
But anyway,

373
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,303
uh,

374
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,390
it's like this kind of a
speech for believing in me.

375
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,390
This is right after he did the wrestler.

376
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:02,751
Oh,

377
00:11:02,751 --> 00:11:03,051
right,

378
00:11:03,051 --> 00:11:03,231
right,

379
00:11:03,231 --> 00:11:04,064
right.

380
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:04,933
Yeah.

381
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,360
Which damn,

382
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:07,194
that was a good movie.

383
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,930
People in the basil directors like Darren
Aronofsky come around every 25 years,

384
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,251
the same way,

385
00:11:15,251 --> 00:11:16,600
like Chimino Coppola,

386
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:17,531
Parker,

387
00:11:17,531 --> 00:11:18,101
Adrian Line,

388
00:11:18,101 --> 00:11:18,934
all the rest of them.

389
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,760
And I said 25 years that you
wish you were in my year 30.

390
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,043
Uh,

391
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:24,610
and uh,

392
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,370
the only thing I want to say to any
young actor or any activity gets an

393
00:11:27,371 --> 00:11:28,690
opportunity to work with Darren.

394
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,510
You better be in shape because
he will break you down.

395
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,080
He is one tough son of a bitch and he
don't like it when I say that cause he

396
00:11:35,081 --> 00:11:35,830
goes make,

397
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,690
he'll scare all the other
actors away from me.

398
00:11:37,691 --> 00:11:38,141
But Darren,

399
00:11:38,141 --> 00:11:38,920
you know what,

400
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,930
if they ain't got the balls
that bring it then fuck them.

401
00:11:40,931 --> 00:11:41,680
You know.

402
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,513
Anyway,

403
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,980
I want to thank uh,

404
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,863
love this guy.

405
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,321
Yeah,

406
00:11:45,321 --> 00:11:45,831
but now,

407
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:46,161
okay,

408
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:48,800
so go from there and look
at the image of him now.

409
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:49,310
Pull up,

410
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:49,880
uh,

411
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,541
Mickey Rourke,

412
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,530
old Gypsy woman.

413
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,220
Just,

414
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:52,680
just,

415
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,820
just Google Mickey Rourke,

416
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,690
old Gypsy woman.

417
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,250
I would just always wonder like,

418
00:11:57,251 --> 00:12:02,251
what the fuck happens to dude's
or women or you know like that,

419
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,990
that Gowe um,

420
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,320
the fuck's her name?

421
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,240
Renee Zellweger right?

422
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,343
That's not even,

423
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,670
no,

424
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:09,881
no,

425
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:10,870
there's that one right there.

426
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,320
Yeah,

427
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,830
this one.

428
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,520
Look at that.

429
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,353
What's gone well,

430
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,730
what does that she,

431
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,480
I said she,

432
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,360
I said she on instincts because like he,

433
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,630
he looks like his name should
be Mildred right there.

434
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:22,891
Like,

435
00:12:22,891 --> 00:12:23,250
just like,

436
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,960
it's that whole like
everything's crazy about that.

437
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,250
The wig is crazy.

438
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:28,420
The face is crazy.

439
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,860
It's like poor bastard pulled
back so he could see his hair.

440
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,290
He's wearing this crazy hair piece.

441
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:40,291
Then is he trying to look like or an
old gypsy woman or is that just no,

442
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:41,410
that's,

443
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,370
he was at the fights.

444
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:42,740
That was,

445
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,820
he was at the UFC and he was upset.

446
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,050
One of the decisions and that
was the face that he made,

447
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:49,300
but he's done something to his lips.

448
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:49,911
Apparently.

449
00:12:49,911 --> 00:12:50,600
You're right.

450
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,600
He looks like the character from the
Stephen King movie a thinner that Gypsy

451
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:59,970
woman that like rubbed her
hand on the face like CNN.

452
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:00,880
Yeah.

453
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,150
Yeah.

454
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:01,983
That's her.

455
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:02,321
Wow.

456
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:02,471
So,

457
00:13:02,471 --> 00:13:02,651
well,

458
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:03,660
I mean him and uh,

459
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,540
Bruce Jenner could hang
out and just talk shit.

460
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,080
I think he's trying to be a woman though.

461
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:10,000
I think now he's not going crazy.

462
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:10,901
I mean,

463
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:12,360
that's what you do.

464
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,810
You think like that's what this business
does to people that as they age,

465
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:20,170
whether it be Renee Zellweger
or a Mickey Rourke are now,

466
00:13:20,171 --> 00:13:21,640
there's some pictures
out there I think of,

467
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,330
I think it's Ooma Thurman where
it's like Huma Thurman's gotten,

468
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,880
I think they did some plastic surgery.

469
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,320
I think she did some plastic surgery to
her and it's just something where you're

470
00:13:32,321 --> 00:13:36,100
built up has like sort of either a sex
symbol or whatever for so long and then

471
00:13:36,101 --> 00:13:36,934
it just goes,

472
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,760
it starts to fade away then
does that fuck with your head?

473
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,441
It would imagine,

474
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:46,441
I mean someone described beauty as a
short live tyranny and I think beauty is

475
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:53,551
like a really hard one because some
women they go from being unbelievably

476
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:56,050
desirable and then through
no fault of their own,

477
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:56,231
just,

478
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:57,700
just father time natural agent.

479
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,720
They become monsters.

480
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,550
Yeah.

481
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,180
Whoa.

482
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,570
What's going on there?

483
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,673
She do.

484
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,310
Uh,

485
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,960
she pulled my God does she do,

486
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:06,370
she pulled some stuff back.

487
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,840
She doesn't look like her.

488
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,733
No,

489
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,340
she uh,

490
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,173
she uh,

491
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,400
she looks like she's a
character from that new movie.

492
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:12,810
Uh,

493
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,180
uh,

494
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,450
x Maki not done is weird man.

495
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,230
Right.

496
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,100
So weird.

497
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:18,730
And did she,

498
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,630
what did she do?

499
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,110
I'm trying to figure
out what she did maybe.

500
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,630
Is that just to her wearing
no makeup except for lipstick?

501
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:26,350
I have,

502
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,370
I have no idea.

503
00:14:27,371 --> 00:14:27,880
I'm not,

504
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,290
I believe it or not,

505
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,310
I'm not a plastic surgeon.

506
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,270
A lot of feeling that if you added like
see like one of them has all the slips,

507
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,730
all of his eye makeup on
and the other one doesn't.

508
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,410
That's a big thing with gals.

509
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,170
Like you ever see a
woman who doesn't have,

510
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:41,801
I make Alan,

511
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:44,290
you'd always hear with eye makeup
on and then one day you don't,

512
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:44,531
you're like,

513
00:14:44,531 --> 00:14:45,070
who are you?

514
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:45,461
Who are you?

515
00:14:45,461 --> 00:14:45,940
Yeah.

516
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,500
You're fucking different humans.

517
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:51,380
The Huffington post and you
might want to porn stars.

518
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,860
Yeah.

519
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,220
Yeah.

520
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,390
The porn stars without makeup thing.

521
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:54,681
That blew my mind.

522
00:14:54,681 --> 00:14:57,800
It's a trip because then you
see these girls without makeup,

523
00:14:57,801 --> 00:14:59,150
like when the makeup on,

524
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:01,400
they are goddesses and you're
just seeing them on the screen.

525
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:01,671
You're like,

526
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:02,504
Holy Shit.

527
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,950
That's like the ideal.

528
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,210
And then you see them without the makeup.

529
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:05,480
You're like,

530
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:05,751
oh,

531
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:08,630
I know eight girls from Riverside
that looked just like that.

532
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,133
It's nuts.

533
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:10,761
Yeah.

534
00:15:10,761 --> 00:15:13,280
You could do some amazing shit
with makeup if you're a chick.

535
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:13,660
Yeah.

536
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,220
Or like there's a,

537
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,940
there was also a story about a dude.

538
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:18,080
He's makeup artists.

539
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,191
He like,

540
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:19,560
he's,

541
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,001
he's,

542
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:23,090
I think he's a black guy and
he showed that with makeup.

543
00:15:23,091 --> 00:15:28,091
He could look like Kim Kardashian and
he put makeup on his face and at the end

544
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:29,600
of it you're like,

545
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:29,991
yeah,

546
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:30,830
that let me grant.

547
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:34,010
It looks like a madame
Tussauds like wax museum,

548
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:34,844
Kim Kardashians.

549
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,683
But that's,

550
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,010
you look like that.

551
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,040
Like you created that and
then he hit his face without,

552
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,690
it is not like that at all.

553
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:44,300
Obviously it looks or a weird thing.

554
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:44,720
Right?

555
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,130
It's like you didn't ask for it,

556
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:47,060
you didn't work for it.

557
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,630
No.

558
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,470
And just boom,

559
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,890
like in it,

560
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,110
it's an old debate.

561
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:55,640
Would you rather have all the looks
and then slowly lose them or would you

562
00:15:55,641 --> 00:15:56,474
rather be like,

563
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,080
uh,

564
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,340
Jason Alexander,

565
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,250
that looks the exact same
as he did 30 years ago,

566
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,420
but he's going crazy too.

567
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:03,730
He's wearing it to pay now.

568
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:04,791
Yeah.

569
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,320
Jason Alexander put it to play on.

570
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:11,310
It's like he's like a walking
episode of Seinfeld sign for,

571
00:16:11,311 --> 00:16:14,510
there was an episode of Seinfeld where
he wore a toupee and it was like,

572
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,470
it was,

573
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,340
it was really awkward.

574
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:18,650
It was really obvious and now
he's kind of trying to do it.

575
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:19,251
I mean,

576
00:16:19,251 --> 00:16:22,030
I don't blame guys to do the,

577
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:22,461
the,

578
00:16:22,461 --> 00:16:22,771
the,

579
00:16:22,771 --> 00:16:22,930
the,

580
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,230
the plugs or anything like that.

581
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,840
I don't blame them.

582
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,071
Hell,

583
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:26,300
a Wayne Rooney,

584
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:26,670
the,

585
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,320
uh,

586
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:27,531
the,

587
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:28,070
uh,

588
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,940
soccer player did it and everyone
knew that he had plugs and he's like,

589
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,600
I don't care.

590
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,200
I hear now.

591
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:33,890
I did it.

592
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,830
But you know what happens man first
when you get a scar in the back of your

593
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:37,131
head.

594
00:16:37,131 --> 00:16:40,760
So I have like a permanent smile on the
back of my head and then second of all,

595
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:44,120
if the rest of your hair falls out the
way I described it as like taking healthy

596
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:46,700
people and moving them into a
neighborhood where everyone is dying,

597
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,100
the other hair falls out.

598
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:49,963
It's like

599
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,640
they haven't figured it out yet.

600
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,930
Like lips,

601
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,460
like when girls get their lips done,

602
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,680
you don't want to be an
early adopter of that.

603
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,440
You don't want someone fucking
with your face permanently.

604
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:00,721
Yeah.

605
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:01,191
This is the,

606
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:01,490
uh,

607
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:01,851
I think,

608
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:02,050
uh,

609
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,060
it was it the bill bourbon.

610
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,360
It was a bill.

611
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,530
A bill burr is a great bit
about this where he's like,

612
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:06,711
yeah,

613
00:17:06,711 --> 00:17:08,690
just wait until they,

614
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,220
until they fucking fix it.

615
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:10,820
Like wait,

616
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,110
wait until they get it right.

617
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:12,650
Like,

618
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,780
like the people that are going
into plastic surgery right now,

619
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:16,600
like wait there,

620
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,250
they can't wait because
they're 50 and they're like,

621
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:19,851
fuck,

622
00:17:19,851 --> 00:17:20,151
you know,

623
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:23,500
I just want to look at 37 you know what,

624
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,540
there's like some doctors nail it though.

625
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:27,100
That's,

626
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:27,501
that's the,

627
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:32,480
the other problem is some doctors can
do a really good job of making look a

628
00:17:32,481 --> 00:17:33,350
little bit better.

629
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:37,700
It's those guys that go crazy
and it's also like a girl,

630
00:17:37,701 --> 00:17:37,940
like,

631
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,101
Ooh,

632
00:17:38,101 --> 00:17:38,601
my Thurman.

633
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:38,990
I mean,

634
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,620
how much shopping around does she do
for a plastic surgeon if she even got

635
00:17:42,621 --> 00:17:45,140
plastic surgery or the
other one Renee Zellweger,

636
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,260
do they just go with someone that
he could trust like that they know?

637
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,123
Do they ask?

638
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,080
I mean,

639
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,520
and that's the thing is we talk about
all the ones that went wrong because the

640
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:54,331
ones that went right,

641
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:55,490
we don't know this.

642
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,010
We're just like,

643
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:56,150
oh,

644
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:56,910
they look great.

645
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,050
A ton that went right,

646
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:58,560
right.

647
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:58,861
I mean,

648
00:17:58,861 --> 00:17:59,580
I don't know who,

649
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,290
but like Christy Brown,

650
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:01,411
well,

651
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:02,790
she says she never had anything done.

652
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,590
She's like 61 or something like that.

653
00:18:04,591 --> 00:18:05,640
She's still hot as fuck.

654
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:05,911
Yeah.

655
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:06,150
That,

656
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,620
I don't know what that is.

657
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:12,621
Or like genetics or
you see a Sophia Loren,

658
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,790
he even when she was 60,

659
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:15,901
65,

660
00:18:15,901 --> 00:18:16,350
you're like,

661
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,160
yeah,

662
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,993
well done.

663
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,893
Good for you.

664
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,400
Well who is the other one?

665
00:18:20,401 --> 00:18:21,280
Raquel Welsh.

666
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:25,320
She's like deep deep into her
seventies and she's still hot as fuck.

667
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:25,770
Yeah,

668
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,420
it's weird.

669
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,240
It's just,

670
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,050
it's the,

671
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,150
just the genetic lottery I guess,

672
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,070
or let orally that like,

673
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:32,311
you know,

674
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:33,144
cause hey,

675
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:33,810
uh,

676
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,050
some people are,

677
00:18:35,051 --> 00:18:37,920
are born and they've got
like the natural like boat,

678
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:39,110
like Bo Jackson and where,

679
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:39,871
where they say like,

680
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:41,070
just natural athlete,

681
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,200
like God given talent or Herschel Walker
just did pushups and sit ups his entire

682
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:48,440
damn life supposedly.

683
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,430
And then not sure I buy that.

684
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,990
Cause he also said that he only eats
like a salad and soup the whole day,

685
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,650
whole day,

686
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,030
which doesn't even make any sense.

687
00:18:57,031 --> 00:19:01,620
And then he also has multiple personality
disorder or trauma induced multiple

688
00:19:01,621 --> 00:19:02,670
personality disorder.

689
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:06,700
So who knows which
Herschel list is a one her,

690
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,570
she might be doing roids squats.

691
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,990
We mean if anybody can
talk about genetic lottery,

692
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:12,790
right.

693
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,080
Yeah,

694
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,913
no kidding.

695
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,370
Yeah.

696
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,820
Cause I mean it could for people don't
know if people aren't listening to this

697
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,510
are people,

698
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,980
a lot of people were just listening to us.

699
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:20,740
Yeah.

700
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,500
You know,

701
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,280
explain,

702
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:22,700
uh,

703
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,160
am a,

704
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,251
uh,

705
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:26,580
Chondra plastic dwarf and that's
the type of dwarfism that I have.

706
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,410
What does that mean?

707
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:27,960
Uh,

708
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,520
cause there's over a
hundred types of dwarfism.

709
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,120
Whoa.

710
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,550
Yeah.

711
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:30,811
Well,

712
00:19:30,811 --> 00:19:32,130
cause it's a genetic mutation.

713
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,310
So you have slight differences in how,

714
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,480
in how the gene,

715
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:36,930
uh,

716
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:37,500
changes.

717
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,050
So there were literally some dwarves out.

718
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:44,370
There's some little people that it's only
like one of three people in the entire

719
00:19:44,371 --> 00:19:46,590
world that have that
specific type of dwarfism.

720
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,210
One of three in the whole world.

721
00:19:48,211 --> 00:19:48,301
Well,

722
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:49,530
what are the differentiations?

723
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:49,860
Well,

724
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,160
like,

725
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,461
okay,

726
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:51,294
for me,

727
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,520
a Achondroplasia is what I have.

728
00:19:53,521 --> 00:19:54,990
It's the most common type of dwarfism,

729
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,153
um,

730
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,110
minus characterized by small arms,

731
00:19:58,111 --> 00:19:58,891
small legs,

732
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:00,000
prominent buttocks.

733
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:00,834
I love that one.

734
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,943
Uh,

735
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,140
prominent buttocks in large forehead,

736
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:04,560
uh,

737
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,000
collapsed nose bridge,

738
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,130
uh,

739
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,100
average size torso.

740
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,320
So like when we're sitting down,

741
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,760
we're making eye contact right now,

742
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,150
but I'm four foot for your six.

743
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,050
You're,

744
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:16,291
yeah,

745
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:16,910
you're,

746
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:17,431
you're five,

747
00:20:17,431 --> 00:20:17,910
eight.

748
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,990
So yeah.

749
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:19,973
But there's some,

750
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,470
there's some dwarves that have a
completely different body type.

751
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:22,740
Like,

752
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,610
like Vern Troyer who played many
meeting Austin Powers movies.

753
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,720
He's got dwarfism,

754
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,030
but it's a completely
different type of dwarfism.

755
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,670
When that guy was on celebrity,

756
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:33,570
what was that show?

757
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,140
Oh,

758
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,100
a surreal life.

759
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,060
Yeah.

760
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,190
Oh that was so sad.

761
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,520
I do a perfect impression of,

762
00:20:40,521 --> 00:20:40,751
of,

763
00:20:40,751 --> 00:20:42,390
of him drunk when he's,

764
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:42,720
uh,

765
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,060
when he's a pissing in the corner,

766
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,030
he made a noise.

767
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:47,381
Oh,

768
00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:47,860
ah.

769
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,311
Oh.

770
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:48,670
Ah.

771
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,630
Is he still alive?

772
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,230
Yeah,

773
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:50,920
he's still alive.

774
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,440
That guy seemed like he was
drinking himself to death,

775
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,340
you would think.

776
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,503
I mean,

777
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,021
hey,

778
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,130
he's still ticking man.

779
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,301
That's amazing.

780
00:20:58,301 --> 00:20:59,134
And he's still alive.

781
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:04,450
It's hardcore for a guy like that too
because he goes and he gets this big

782
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,370
movie,

783
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,230
he becomes a celebrity like
almost instantaneously.

784
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:13,780
And then after that it kind of dries up
and no one wants to see him humble laser

785
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:14,440
anymore.

786
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,940
So that what you got.

787
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,720
And it's weird cause I,

788
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,110
I saw that and when I was
trying to into show business,

789
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,230
that's one of the reasons why
I love being a standup comic.

790
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:25,000
Cause no matter what,

791
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:29,080
I could always go on stage and talking
from an audience and be and be funny.

792
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,010
I can do that.

793
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:30,730
Like,

794
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,300
and there's only a few amount of
people that can actually do that.

795
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:35,860
So as long as I got that skill,

796
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,581
I'm good.

797
00:21:36,581 --> 00:21:38,440
I don't have to wait
until the producer says,

798
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:39,010
yes,

799
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:39,940
I'll put you in a movie.

800
00:21:39,941 --> 00:21:40,181
Yes,

801
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:41,014
I'll put you on a TV show it.

802
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,111
Well,

803
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:42,430
to answer your earlier question,

804
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:45,250
I think that's what makes
people go crazy out here.

805
00:21:45,251 --> 00:21:47,410
Like does the business do it to them?

806
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,990
What goes crazy is that they,

807
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,200
they're not in control,

808
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:51,070
their own destiny.

809
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,400
So if they do have any
sort of success whatsoever,

810
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:56,500
if anything does take off for them,

811
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:57,760
it's like they're like,

812
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:58,101
oh,

813
00:21:58,101 --> 00:21:58,360
it's,

814
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,080
it's happening,

815
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,681
it's happening.

816
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:01,400
It's like it's all out of their control,

817
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,170
right?

818
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,430
You audition for things,

819
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,660
get the job,

820
00:22:04,661 --> 00:22:05,800
you're on the set.

821
00:22:05,801 --> 00:22:06,191
It's like,

822
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:07,270
when is this going away?

823
00:22:07,271 --> 00:22:09,020
And you've got to cultivate your career.

824
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,070
So they have to be very careful about
the things that they say and yeah,

825
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,480
absolutely.

826
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,261
So yeah.

827
00:22:14,261 --> 00:22:16,060
And that's one reason.

828
00:22:16,061 --> 00:22:16,631
It's like light.

829
00:22:16,631 --> 00:22:17,201
Like I said,

830
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:18,070
I love being a comic.

831
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:18,904
It's I,

832
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:19,810
no matter,

833
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:20,643
no matter what,

834
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,850
I always have that if,

835
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:22,780
because,

836
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,021
yeah,

837
00:22:23,021 --> 00:22:23,740
I've had,

838
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,590
I've had a ton of auditions for
TV shows that I haven't gotten.

839
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:27,431
Thanks Peter.

840
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:28,500
Dinklage ah,

841
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,140
fuck that guys changed the games.

842
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,721
Amazing.

843
00:22:32,721 --> 00:22:33,760
He's changed the game.

844
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,410
He's so fucking good.

845
00:22:35,411 --> 00:22:35,920
He's the,

846
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,920
he's the main guy and I'd show he's the
dude and it's the biggest movie ever,

847
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,790
the biggest show rather ever.

848
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,600
And that show is one of the
most impactful shows ever.

849
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,030
And a dwarf is really the big guy.

850
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,470
And I love that.

851
00:22:50,471 --> 00:22:51,940
And the fact that,

852
00:22:51,941 --> 00:22:52,331
yeah,

853
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:55,000
they talk about like can
being a dwarf in the show,

854
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:56,290
but it's not the focus.

855
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,070
I love that.

856
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,150
It's just like the,

857
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,770
he talked about now off man,

858
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:04,771
it was what's beautiful about what he
does in his character and that show is he

859
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,820
utilizes it to his advantage and he,

860
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,520
he lets people underestimate
him because ultimately,

861
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:11,230
yeah.

862
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,310
And a Lord,

863
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,390
Lord knows that's,

864
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,020
uh,

865
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,180
that's true for anyone
that has to work with them.

866
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:16,421
Like,

867
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:17,254
we're not,

868
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,160
like,

869
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,350
no one thinks that we
can do certain things or,

870
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,670
or they're just not sure.

871
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,230
Like hell.

872
00:23:23,231 --> 00:23:25,170
When I played hockey when I was a kid,

873
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:29,380
like the coaches on the other
team would tell their players,

874
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:29,650
all right,

875
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,730
don't hit Brad.

876
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,530
We don't know what's going to happen.

877
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:33,310
Wow.

878
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:33,641
Like,

879
00:23:33,641 --> 00:23:36,100
I don't know if they thought that they
would hit me and I would just like

880
00:23:36,101 --> 00:23:38,620
explode into candy or something like that.

881
00:23:38,621 --> 00:23:40,060
But they're like,

882
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,003
donut,

883
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:41,950
we don't know.

884
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,690
He could summon a spell.

885
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:44,763
Like,

886
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,610
I don't know what they thought,

887
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,480
but uh,

888
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:47,751
yeah,

889
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:48,030
like,

890
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:48,260
uh,

891
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,160
like people,

892
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,030
uh,

893
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,470
people underestimate hell.

894
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:56,470
The first time I ever went on stage I got
on stage because a B because I guy was

895
00:23:56,781 --> 00:23:57,081
just like,

896
00:23:57,081 --> 00:23:57,261
well,

897
00:23:57,261 --> 00:23:57,831
you're a dwarf.

898
00:23:57,831 --> 00:23:58,190
That's,

899
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,390
that's funny enough.

900
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,310
And then I went on stage and
started telling jokes and he's like,

901
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,570
Oh shit,

902
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,090
you're,

903
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:03,301
you,

904
00:24:03,301 --> 00:24:05,480
you actually have jokes
actually prepared for this.

905
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:06,020
Yeah.

906
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,470
Awesome.

907
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:06,980
When did you,

908
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,020
what was your first time on
stage telling you been doing it?

909
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,520
I'll be doing a 12,

910
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,510
12 years.

911
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,343
Uh,

912
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,740
and I've told this story on a couple
of radio shows podcasts before,

913
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:16,330
but,

914
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:16,680
uh,

915
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,300
it,

916
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,900
I'll tell it just cause it's a
very interesting time with you is,

917
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:21,260
uh,

918
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,310
I was in the audience,

919
00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:22,941
have a,

920
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:23,720
uh,

921
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,470
Carlos been see a show and he's
on stage making midget jokes.

922
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,850
Half the audience is laughing.

923
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,830
Half the audience that's sitting by me,

924
00:24:30,831 --> 00:24:31,664
it's just like,

925
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,240
like just kind of pointing over like,

926
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,473
hmm.

927
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:39,500
And he notices that and
you look so over and goes,

928
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:40,363
why?

929
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,330
Why aren't you guys laughing?

930
00:24:41,331 --> 00:24:42,320
And he actually said the sentence,

931
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:43,400
what is one of them here?

932
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,200
And I just raised my hand.

933
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:45,471
I was like,

934
00:24:45,471 --> 00:24:46,304
what's up dude?

935
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,250
And uh,

936
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:47,511
he,

937
00:24:47,511 --> 00:24:49,060
he didn't even flinch.

938
00:24:49,061 --> 00:24:50,090
He called me up on stage like,

939
00:24:50,091 --> 00:24:50,630
Holy Shit,

940
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,463
I got to talk to you.

941
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,120
And I'd never done standup at that point.

942
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:53,811
And,

943
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:54,410
uh,

944
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,191
I walk on stage,

945
00:24:55,191 --> 00:24:58,400
he started asking me questions
and the answers I gave got laughs.

946
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,570
And uh,

947
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,410
that's when I was like,

948
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:00,890
Oh wow,

949
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:01,940
this is what I have to do for a living.

950
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:02,571
Wow.

951
00:25:02,571 --> 00:25:05,120
So Carlos Garcia did do
something good in this world.

952
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,073
Yay.

953
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,300
That's amazing.

954
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:08,570
Yeah.

955
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,403
That's why,

956
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,600
that's why I said at the very beginning,

957
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:13,150
like if you'd told me six years ago that,

958
00:25:13,151 --> 00:25:14,360
that I'd be sitting with you.

959
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:15,111
I'd be like,

960
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:15,770
no way in hell.

961
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,000
Because there was a time,

962
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:22,040
and I talked about this with a
red band on my podcast when he,

963
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:22,874
when he came on,

964
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,700
there was a time I hated you guys.

965
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,550
I absolutely hated you and I
had never met you guys before,

966
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:29,770
but you know,

967
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,740
he was like teams,

968
00:25:30,741 --> 00:25:31,251
you know what I mean?

969
00:25:31,251 --> 00:25:32,360
It was like this guy's trying to take,

970
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:33,320
I'm a boss and my friend.

971
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,340
What's up fucker?

972
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:34,871
You know,

973
00:25:34,871 --> 00:25:35,704
I get it.

974
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,400
He was helping you,

975
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,160
but you had to know.

976
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,170
Yeah.

977
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:40,630
Yeah.

978
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,220
It,

979
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,040
I mean everybody knew there's,

980
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:43,960
I mean,

981
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,090
but the things that he would do for me,

982
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:52,300
I can never repay the man enough cause
he literally took me from being nothing

983
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,110
like an open miker.

984
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:54,690
Uh,

985
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:55,160
cause what?

986
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,971
Cause what happened was,

987
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,110
is I got bit by the bug.

988
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:57,950
Uh,

989
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,290
I started doing stand up
about a year and a half later.

990
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,120
I showed up to one of these shows.

991
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:02,690
Um,

992
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,220
and he,

993
00:26:04,221 --> 00:26:04,850
uh,

994
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:05,790
and he,

995
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,970
he recognized me and he said like,

996
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:08,330
Dude,

997
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,980
you're the guy to do start doing standup.

998
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:10,281
And I said,

999
00:26:10,281 --> 00:26:10,431
yeah,

1000
00:26:10,431 --> 00:26:11,264
but doing it about a year,

1001
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:11,811
he goes,

1002
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:12,141
okay,

1003
00:26:12,141 --> 00:26:12,651
well let's,

1004
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:13,370

1005
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:14,540
let's get you up on stage.

1006
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:15,080
Let's,

1007
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,450

1008
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:16,821
Let's see,

1009
00:26:16,821 --> 00:26:17,780
let's see what you got.

1010
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,400
And that's the whole like,

1011
00:26:19,401 --> 00:26:20,450
I put you up there cause you're a dwarf.

1012
00:26:20,451 --> 00:26:21,051
Anything that's funny.

1013
00:26:21,051 --> 00:26:21,950
But then Holy Shit,

1014
00:26:21,951 --> 00:26:22,784
you got jokes.

1015
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,370
And when I came off stage
after doing about five minutes,

1016
00:26:25,371 --> 00:26:25,821
he goes,

1017
00:26:25,821 --> 00:26:26,360
wow,

1018
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,193
um,

1019
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:30,590
do you want to be my new opening
act like right then and there?

1020
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,700
And I was,

1021
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,230
I was a junior in college.

1022
00:26:33,231 --> 00:26:34,430
I was going to USC,

1023
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,030
I had a year to go to graduate and uh,

1024
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,870
I dropped out,

1025
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:38,210
I dropped,

1026
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:41,430
I dropped out to be his opening act
and I was his opening act for four,

1027
00:26:41,431 --> 00:26:42,440
for four years.

1028
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,940
That's first of all way
better job security.

1029
00:26:44,941 --> 00:26:46,350
If you're funny than ever,

1030
00:26:46,351 --> 00:26:48,870
whatever fucking career
you're going to put together.

1031
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:51,990
And people tell me,

1032
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:52,561
they're like,

1033
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:52,711
oh,

1034
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,000
but you were going to college.

1035
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:54,211
Like,

1036
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:55,050
what were you studying?

1037
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,100
Stop.

1038
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,750
I was a communications major,

1039
00:26:57,751 --> 00:26:58,650
so calm down.

1040
00:26:58,651 --> 00:26:59,790
I wasn't curing cancer.

1041
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,320
Even if you were a doctor,

1042
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:01,681
you know,

1043
00:27:01,681 --> 00:27:04,830
hard doctors have to work unless
you were like obsessed with being a

1044
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,900
neurosurgeon or something crazy like that.

1045
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,430
Fuck that job.

1046
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:08,781
Yeah,

1047
00:27:08,781 --> 00:27:09,051
yeah,

1048
00:27:09,051 --> 00:27:09,301
yeah.

1049
00:27:09,301 --> 00:27:12,450
I'm so glad that other people
do it because it was so,

1050
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,380
so dumb.

1051
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:13,951
Ass is like me.

1052
00:27:13,951 --> 00:27:14,460
Don't have to,

1053
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,720
well you know a guy like Carlos,

1054
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,760
even people that do bad things,

1055
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,920
like people that have bad ethics,

1056
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:21,630
they're not always bad.

1057
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:22,950
No know there's,

1058
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,170
there's a lot of gray in
this world and that's,

1059
00:27:25,171 --> 00:27:26,580
that's the reality of life.

1060
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,740
And he took me on the road and when we,

1061
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,670
and we were on the road,

1062
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:31,380
he would pay for all my travel.

1063
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,540
He would pay for all my meals.

1064
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:33,870
If,

1065
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,280
if we were ever going shopping,

1066
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:35,731
he'd say,

1067
00:27:35,731 --> 00:27:36,010
Hey,

1068
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:36,721
whatever,

1069
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,070
you're getting thrown on my pile.

1070
00:27:38,071 --> 00:27:38,904
I'm good.

1071
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,200
Like he took great care of me.

1072
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:44,550
And it's funny cause I mean like I
still consider him a damn good friend.

1073
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:45,420
Uh,

1074
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,100
but now I'm friends with you and like,

1075
00:27:47,101 --> 00:27:48,780
I'm friends with Bert Kreischer.

1076
00:27:48,781 --> 00:27:53,520
I'm friends with Jay more like I'm
friends with all these guys like a fence

1077
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:53,880
rider,

1078
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,713
Brad Williams.

1079
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,090
I don't pick a side.

1080
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:57,840
Whatever.

1081
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,501
That's good man.

1082
00:27:58,501 --> 00:27:59,910
You don't have to do to,

1083
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,440
I have friends that hate other friends.

1084
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,393
Sure.

1085
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,570
I have a lot of
acquaintances like that and,

1086
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:05,921
and,

1087
00:28:05,921 --> 00:28:07,530
and if you're the can't deal with that,

1088
00:28:07,531 --> 00:28:08,320
their babies,

1089
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,580
you know,

1090
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,250
if you really need all your friends
to be on your team like Nah Bro,

1091
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,113
the fuck off.

1092
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,980
Some people aren't going
to like each other.

1093
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:14,980
That's fine.

1094
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,530
And if you have fans,

1095
00:28:16,531 --> 00:28:20,820
and I'm sure you have fans that will
never liked me because of my association.

1096
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,480
Not True.

1097
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,140
I mean those,

1098
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,370
those guys aren't really fans.

1099
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,140
Okay.

1100
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,090
I mean punks

1101
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,650
and I mean that's fine.

1102
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:29,803
That's okay.

1103
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,361
That's okay.

1104
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:32,550
If you think that that
term fan is weird anyway.

1105
00:28:32,551 --> 00:28:32,940
Right,

1106
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,773
right.

1107
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:34,690
I hate it.

1108
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:35,640
I hardly ever use it.

1109
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:36,630
It just seems odd.

1110
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,340
It seems like you're diminishing a person.

1111
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,840
It's like people that like you,

1112
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,733
that's what they are.

1113
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,150
When you call someone a fan,

1114
00:28:42,151 --> 00:28:43,380
it's like all of a sudden like there's a,

1115
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,020
there's like a different tier does you?

1116
00:28:46,021 --> 00:28:46,740
And then there's them,

1117
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,180
there's you and then there's the fans.

1118
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,360
It,

1119
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,193
it's weird.

1120
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,283
It just,

1121
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,520
whenever you label things like that,

1122
00:28:53,521 --> 00:28:54,570
like there's just people,

1123
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,400
you know,

1124
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:55,560
I,

1125
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,000
there's a lot of bands that I like.

1126
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,880
Well I'm a fan of a lot of musicians
and now I'm friends with them and it's

1127
00:28:59,881 --> 00:29:00,610
weird.

1128
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,443
Why?

1129
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,420
Yeah.

1130
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,410
And like when I started doing comedy,

1131
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:05,760
that started happening a lot.

1132
00:29:05,761 --> 00:29:10,050
Like I was a fan of people and then you
know like once you get past a certain

1133
00:29:10,051 --> 00:29:14,550
level and that level is pretty much just
open miker once you get past that level

1134
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:17,820
you meet like every one is like
if you're in New York or la,

1135
00:29:17,821 --> 00:29:19,410
you run into everybody.

1136
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,240
So now I'm like,

1137
00:29:21,241 --> 00:29:23,040
I'm friends with David Tell,

1138
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:28,070
which is weird cause I love
David towl so damn funny.

1139
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:32,160
And then I started talking to him and
now like I get an email from them every

1140
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:32,994
now and then it's like,

1141
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,571
Holy Shit,

1142
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:36,420
David tells email but I
can't have that moment.

1143
00:29:36,421 --> 00:29:36,691
I got to go.

1144
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:36,871
No,

1145
00:29:36,871 --> 00:29:38,310
this is your friend Dave.

1146
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,110
This is not David.

1147
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,890
Tell the comedy God Paul.

1148
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:43,743
And we'll get those.

1149
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,161
I still get those ones.

1150
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:46,420
I talked to Anthony Bordain like,

1151
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:46,691
oh,

1152
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:47,650
this is my friend,

1153
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,393
weird,

1154
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:49,900
you know,

1155
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,440
Joe Perry was on the podcast and w every
now and then Joe Perry text me and I'll

1156
00:29:53,441 --> 00:29:54,010
show a friend.

1157
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:54,170
Like,

1158
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:54,400
yeah,

1159
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,233
fucking joke again,

1160
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,200
like Joe Perry's texting me right now

1161
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,460
and it's been said a million times,

1162
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:02,620
but I can't emphasize
enough that it's true.

1163
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,000
The people that you put on
pedestals are still people.

1164
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:11,220
No one is this being of
all power that's hot.

1165
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,460
Higher levels.

1166
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:14,410
Like they're all people.

1167
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:17,890
Everyone is a person and the most
brilliant people on Earth are just people.

1168
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:20,260
And one of the things that I've
found is the most successful people,

1169
00:30:20,261 --> 00:30:21,520
the most interesting people,

1170
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,540
people that I truly
enjoy talking to their,

1171
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,830
they don't expect anything different.

1172
00:30:26,831 --> 00:30:29,050
And as soon as someone does
expect something different,

1173
00:30:29,051 --> 00:30:30,370
then they stopped being cool.

1174
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:31,630
Then I like them anymore.

1175
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:32,170
I can't,

1176
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,250
I can't just talk to you.

1177
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:33,491
You're,

1178
00:30:33,491 --> 00:30:33,881
you're now,

1179
00:30:33,881 --> 00:30:34,631
you're fucking weird.

1180
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:34,841
Yeah.

1181
00:30:34,841 --> 00:30:35,170
Now,

1182
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,280
now I have to make an appointment.

1183
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:36,550
Like,

1184
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,150
um,

1185
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:37,571
uh,

1186
00:30:37,571 --> 00:30:41,200
I was at the Hollywood Improv
and a Paul Mccartney was there.

1187
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:41,651
Yeah,

1188
00:30:41,651 --> 00:30:42,484
I was there.

1189
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,323
I was there that night.

1190
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,260
He was there two different times.

1191
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:45,800
Really?

1192
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,290
Yeah.

1193
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:46,550
It,

1194
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,170
he'd loved,

1195
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:51,340
I guess for a while he just loved coming
to see comedy and I got to talk to him

1196
00:30:51,341 --> 00:30:52,240
very briefly,

1197
00:30:52,241 --> 00:30:53,200
but still,

1198
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,520
but he had it like a guy that kept trying
to drag him away and he kept looking

1199
00:30:57,521 --> 00:30:57,821
at like,

1200
00:30:57,821 --> 00:30:58,061
no,

1201
00:30:58,061 --> 00:30:58,181
no,

1202
00:30:58,181 --> 00:30:58,480
no.

1203
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,070
Sorry.

1204
00:30:59,070 --> 00:30:59,390
Yeah,

1205
00:30:59,390 --> 00:30:59,801
let me talk.

1206
00:30:59,801 --> 00:31:00,420
Let me tell him.

1207
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:00,730
And like,

1208
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,690
he was the guy,

1209
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,650
whoever is fucking handler,

1210
00:31:03,651 --> 00:31:04,540
like handler,

1211
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:06,040
whatever the fudge maggot.

1212
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,521
Yeah.

1213
00:31:06,521 --> 00:31:07,061
It's just like Paul,

1214
00:31:07,061 --> 00:31:07,421
we gotta go,

1215
00:31:07,421 --> 00:31:08,020
we gotta go.

1216
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,580
And Paul told him no,

1217
00:31:09,581 --> 00:31:10,600
and like took the time.

1218
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:13,210
And that's literally the most
famous person on the planet.

1219
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,080
He's right up there.

1220
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:18,340
He's got to be top five and
he's taking time to be like,

1221
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:18,581
no,

1222
00:31:18,581 --> 00:31:21,190
I'm going to give this guy his moment.

1223
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,010
And I don't know if it's just
because he's a great dude.

1224
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:27,850
Maybe he understands that I'm Paul
Mccartney and if I talked to a guy,

1225
00:31:27,851 --> 00:31:29,080
it's going to make his life.

1226
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:29,940
Uh,

1227
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,450
I think he's just a normal dude.

1228
00:31:31,451 --> 00:31:32,920
When I watched him talking to people,

1229
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:36,430
he just seems like a guy
who is a great artist,

1230
00:31:36,431 --> 00:31:37,750
but it's just a human being.

1231
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:38,020
Yeah,

1232
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,570
that's exactly what he seems
like just a human being,

1233
00:31:40,571 --> 00:31:40,900
man.

1234
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,860
So yeah,

1235
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:42,640
it's uh,

1236
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,850
it's cool when you realize that
and it's cool when you realize,

1237
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,091
oh yeah,

1238
00:31:46,091 --> 00:31:47,530
I can just talk to whoever.

1239
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:48,110
And,

1240
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:53,110
and when people in show business or
whatever athletes that you look up to,

1241
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,240
like I have fans that are
musicians that I like and you know,

1242
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:01,780
like now it's like wait,

1243
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:03,130
they watch that they watch.

1244
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:03,611
Yeah,

1245
00:32:03,611 --> 00:32:05,200
of course they watched that TV show,

1246
00:32:05,201 --> 00:32:06,820
they listened to that podcast.

1247
00:32:06,821 --> 00:32:09,700
They consume entertainment just
because they're a human being.

1248
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,670
Well that's also the cool thing
about podcasts is that podcasts,

1249
00:32:12,671 --> 00:32:17,380
these long form long form
conversations with no interruptions,

1250
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:17,620
they,

1251
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,640
they give you insight
to a person that you,

1252
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,030
you're like,

1253
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:25,240
like there's a lot of people listening
to this right now feel like they're

1254
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:27,490
sitting in here talking
to us just hanging out.

1255
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,391
Cause that's what we're doing.

1256
00:32:28,391 --> 00:32:28,840
We're just,

1257
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,740
we're just hanging out.

1258
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,040
Yeah.

1259
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,731
It's not that.

1260
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:32,770
It's not that radio thing where it's like,

1261
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,071
all right,

1262
00:32:33,071 --> 00:32:33,700
you have a fault,

1263
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,960
you have a four minute break,

1264
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,260
and so you got to essentially you're,

1265
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,740
you're like pepper and you're pretty
much doing your act because you're just

1266
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:40,070
trying to get

1267
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,240
as many jokes in as possible.

1268
00:32:41,241 --> 00:32:44,930
So people come see you and wherever
a common club you're playing,

1269
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:45,291
it's like,

1270
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:45,471
no,

1271
00:32:45,471 --> 00:32:50,471
this is an actual conversation where you
actually can dive into how people tick

1272
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:52,910
and what people's thoughts
are in the same sentence.

1273
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,870
Four minute breaks,

1274
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:55,280
they fuck with the flow.

1275
00:32:55,430 --> 00:33:00,020
That's why I don't break up right
money ever with come with commercials.

1276
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,490
I just do them in the
beginning of the end.

1277
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,690
I don't buy and I get all of these
like really juicy offers to doom in the

1278
00:33:05,691 --> 00:33:06,390
middle and I'm like,

1279
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,000
it just fucks with the flow,

1280
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:08,431
man.

1281
00:33:08,431 --> 00:33:11,870
You can't just stop a conversation
like I'll do Adam Carolla's podcast.

1282
00:33:11,871 --> 00:33:12,680
I love the dude.

1283
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,513
But he'll be like,

1284
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,471
well that's funny Shane,

1285
00:33:14,471 --> 00:33:18,140
that brand because a real great man.

1286
00:33:18,141 --> 00:33:19,250
Great man.

1287
00:33:19,251 --> 00:33:20,084
Great.

1288
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,470
He'll just start talking and you're like,

1289
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:21,690
oh,

1290
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:22,520
you doing an ad?

1291
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:22,880
Oh,

1292
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,750
he's reading now.

1293
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:24,650
Okay.

1294
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,483
All right.

1295
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,880
And then you sort of build
up this conversation.

1296
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,070
I think go back into it also,

1297
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,220
one of the reasons why I like doing these
really long form conversations cause I

1298
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:35,540
always found when I'm talking to people,

1299
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:36,374
when we're alone,

1300
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:36,770
we have a,

1301
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:38,520
I'm having a really cool
conversation with someone.

1302
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:42,280
It takes a while to sort of get cooking
and then when it gets cookin everybody's

1303
00:33:42,281 --> 00:33:43,820
sort of relaxes and settles in,

1304
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:46,040
then you really kind of
understand who that person is,

1305
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:46,540
right?

1306
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:46,800
Yeah.

1307
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,633
No.

1308
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:51,350
Now a red band told me something
when he was on the podcast,

1309
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:51,710
uh,

1310
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,480
when he was on my podcast
called about last night.

1311
00:33:53,481 --> 00:33:54,470
What's up plug?

1312
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,280
Uh,

1313
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:55,761
that I,

1314
00:33:55,761 --> 00:33:59,390
that I wanted to ask you about because
he said there was like a meeting at some

1315
00:33:59,391 --> 00:33:59,661
point.

1316
00:33:59,661 --> 00:34:00,680
Are you brought something up?

1317
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:01,730
Uh,

1318
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:04,640
during the whole feud wars thing,

1319
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:05,150
call,

1320
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:08,090
whatever you will where you said let's,

1321
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,950
let's steal Mincey as midget.

1322
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,173
No,

1323
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,860
he's so retarded.

1324
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,870
That's so not true.

1325
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,470
And that was a,

1326
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,560
that was a fucking
sketch from the man show.

1327
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,520
Oh really?

1328
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,061
Yes.

1329
00:34:20,061 --> 00:34:20,660
It was a ski.

1330
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,740
He's so confused.

1331
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,480
Memory sucks so bad.

1332
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,270
I was hoping there was
a meeting was it was,

1333
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,370
we definitely didn't have it.

1334
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,480
We might have joked around
about it because it was
during the same sort of time

1335
00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:32,871
period.

1336
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:33,850
But we did a,

1337
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:34,320
uh,

1338
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:34,911
a sketch,

1339
00:34:34,911 --> 00:34:37,340
Stan hope did on the man show.

1340
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,300
He went out,

1341
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:38,481
oh,

1342
00:34:38,481 --> 00:34:41,480
look at the devil every is
came in and perfect time.

1343
00:34:41,481 --> 00:34:43,480
We just dissecting one
of your bullshit stories.

1344
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:50,410
There was a sketch for the man show where
Doug Stan hope was trying to steal the

1345
00:34:51,201 --> 00:34:52,810
man show midget.

1346
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,833
Yeah.

1347
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:54,590
From,

1348
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,790
from those guys.

1349
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:56,950
From the guys,

1350
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,100
the,

1351
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,441
the,

1352
00:34:57,441 --> 00:34:58,274
the um,

1353
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,960
Adam Carolla and Jimmy Kimmel show.

1354
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:00,950
And it was a,

1355
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,820
he was a brilliant,

1356
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,680
brilliant fucking bit.

1357
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:03,981
Yeah,

1358
00:35:03,981 --> 00:35:04,814
it was,

1359
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,340
yeah.

1360
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:05,670
Done.

1361
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,503
Did something to him.

1362
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,300
Great Shit on that.

1363
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,320
And that was one of them.

1364
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:09,920
Okay.

1365
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,110
And so mean maybe we said,

1366
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:12,560
you know,

1367
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,960
we should do that to him
and see his buddy Brad,

1368
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:18,140
but we definitely didn't have
a fucking meeting plan out,

1369
00:35:18,141 --> 00:35:18,974
stealing,

1370
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,960
haven't meeting is a meeting.

1371
00:35:20,961 --> 00:35:21,621
I just said it was,

1372
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:22,070
you said,

1373
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,050
you said there was a
conversation where you're like,

1374
00:35:24,051 --> 00:35:24,620
let's do it live.

1375
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,453
A steel mill.

1376
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,601
We talk about,

1377
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:29,390
would you blow a Unicorn if you
knew you could live forever?

1378
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,500
We've had some pretty ridiculous
conversations about the answer's yes,

1379
00:35:33,501 --> 00:35:34,311
but yeah,

1380
00:35:34,311 --> 00:35:35,150
if you could live forever,

1381
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:35,781
but I don't know,

1382
00:35:35,781 --> 00:35:35,991
man,

1383
00:35:35,991 --> 00:35:37,620
you might not want to live forever

1384
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:38,551
more.

1385
00:35:38,551 --> 00:35:39,720
I as I get older,

1386
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:40,320
I'm like,

1387
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:40,680
who?

1388
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:40,981
You know,

1389
00:35:40,981 --> 00:35:42,030
if you weren't alive,

1390
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,530
you would never expect life,

1391
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,360
right?

1392
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,720
Because you wouldn't
have any expectations.

1393
00:35:45,721 --> 00:35:46,554
You wouldn't be alive.

1394
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,800
Now that you are alive where you
wouldn't expect what happens after life,

1395
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,420
we're just guessing that it's nothing.

1396
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:51,810
Right.

1397
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:52,171
You know,

1398
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:56,120
and I'm not saying that it's a bunch of
dudes in the clouds with a harp shirts.

1399
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:01,160
Very possible that whatever
the fuck consciousness is
is not native only to this

1400
00:36:01,831 --> 00:36:02,640
space.

1401
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,300
It's not.

1402
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,700
It's not restricted
only to this existence.

1403
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:08,460
It's very possible that whatever you have,

1404
00:36:08,461 --> 00:36:10,140
whatever's going on when you dream,

1405
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:11,041
whatever's going on,

1406
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:13,170
when you take mushrooms
with whatever's going on,

1407
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,004
when you die,

1408
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,650
they might be very similar things.

1409
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:15,780
Your,

1410
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,021
your,

1411
00:36:16,021 --> 00:36:20,580
your consciousness might be some sort of
energy that moves on to some new plane

1412
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:24,240
of existence that might be way cooler
than this healthy body that we're all

1413
00:36:24,241 --> 00:36:26,040
trapped as if the,

1414
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,360
if the theory holds true,

1415
00:36:27,361 --> 00:36:29,910
that there's an infinite
number of universes.

1416
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:32,430
Who knows that you just don't
hop to another universe and say,

1417
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,120
all right,

1418
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,020
there's your shot again.

1419
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:34,883
Go again.

1420
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:35,671
Who knows?

1421
00:36:35,671 --> 00:36:37,920
That's not what happens
every time you wake up.

1422
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:41,100
It's very possible that every time
you wake up you were in a different

1423
00:36:41,101 --> 00:36:41,934
existence.

1424
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,950
Blow my mind already.

1425
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:43,650
Joe Rogan,

1426
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,780
I had a crazy dream about that last night.

1427
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,670
I had a crazy dream last night.

1428
00:36:47,671 --> 00:36:48,600
That was a,

1429
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:51,030
I had DMT trip in my dream,

1430
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,170
which I've never had before.

1431
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,970
Now I've had DMT,

1432
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:55,980
DMT.

1433
00:36:55,981 --> 00:36:56,880
I'm new to all of this,

1434
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,770
but DMT trip during your dream,

1435
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:59,731
that's sort of Meta,

1436
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:00,091
isn't it?

1437
00:37:00,091 --> 00:37:03,290
Cause isn't DMT kind of what makes
you train supposedly that's a lot.

1438
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,133
All theory,

1439
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:04,921
but it's not what,

1440
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:06,870
you'd never dream a DMT trip.

1441
00:37:06,871 --> 00:37:10,590
Like DMT trips are way more intense
than a dream because you're getting,

1442
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:14,010
you're flooding your brain with this
chemical that's native to your brain.

1443
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,560
But the idea being that
when you're sleeping,

1444
00:37:16,561 --> 00:37:19,800
there's times when you're in heavy rem
sleep or you're not conscious when you do

1445
00:37:19,801 --> 00:37:21,090
visit the same realms.

1446
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,860
But I've never remembered it before.

1447
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,690
Not like,

1448
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:24,660
like last night,

1449
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:26,400
like last night I was in there,

1450
00:37:26,401 --> 00:37:26,731
man.

1451
00:37:26,731 --> 00:37:27,541
It was really,

1452
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:27,991
really,

1453
00:37:27,991 --> 00:37:30,120
really intense and very strange.

1454
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,850
But it was essentially,

1455
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:38,180
it was this dream was in some way
telling me that this state that,

1456
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:44,520
that what we're doing here right now
that don't get all crazy about this,

1457
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,380
don't get crazy about this life,

1458
00:37:46,381 --> 00:37:51,381
don't get too fixated on it because it's
really just one piece of some sort of

1459
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:55,030
infinite mandola of existence
and just they're like,

1460
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:55,611
that was the,

1461
00:37:55,611 --> 00:37:58,500
the entire DMT trip and my dream was,

1462
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,270
was relax,

1463
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:00,840
relax.

1464
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:05,380
It was like somehow another
coaxing or coaching rather me to,

1465
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,020
to relax and to,

1466
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:12,070
to understand that like all the stress
and all the weird shit that people have

1467
00:38:12,211 --> 00:38:12,811
in their brain.

1468
00:38:12,811 --> 00:38:16,330
Like the more you can like
settle that in the mall,

1469
00:38:16,331 --> 00:38:16,860
you can,

1470
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,790
ah,

1471
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:22,820
the more you can exist in like
a real peaceful state where,

1472
00:38:23,691 --> 00:38:28,350
where this is like your real self
[inaudible] you're just constantly being

1473
00:38:28,351 --> 00:38:32,400
inundated with all these different ideas
and stresses and different things that

1474
00:38:32,401 --> 00:38:35,250
you're trying to accomplish in different
things that you're concentrating on,

1475
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,221
worrying about,

1476
00:38:36,221 --> 00:38:37,540
concerned about the,

1477
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:37,841
you know,

1478
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:39,490
that you anticipate in the future.

1479
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,920
But I thought all these things
are bullshit and that was,

1480
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:42,830
that was the dream last night.

1481
00:38:42,831 --> 00:38:43,331
It was very,

1482
00:38:43,331 --> 00:38:44,110
very strange.

1483
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:44,870
Huh.

1484
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:45,440
Wow.

1485
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:45,800
Did you,

1486
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,450
were you on the new mood?

1487
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,670
Was it at the five HTP and no,

1488
00:38:49,671 --> 00:38:50,630
no I didn't take anything.

1489
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:51,341
Just went to sleep.

1490
00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:53,560
I mean I took some Alpha
brain during the day.

1491
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,150
Uh,

1492
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,770
I don't know if that had
anything to do with it.

1493
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,480
I've been taking that Zma again,

1494
00:38:58,481 --> 00:39:00,270
I just got a new bottle of it and that,

1495
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:02,680
that shit really does fuck
with your dreams alive.

1496
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,510
Cause ever since I got
that bottle every night,

1497
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:06,430
I haven't had dreams until I got that

1498
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,650
zinc ups or testosterone.

1499
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:10,771
It a ups,

1500
00:39:10,771 --> 00:39:13,740
your sperm production probably
has a lot to do with the,

1501
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,800
and then it probably helps you sleep too.

1502
00:39:15,801 --> 00:39:16,730
I think it relaxes you.

1503
00:39:16,731 --> 00:39:17,564
It helps you sleep

1504
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,300
stuff I know nothing about.

1505
00:39:19,301 --> 00:39:24,301
So I'm fascinated by all by all
this stuff like just in your,

1506
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:28,930
cause you've done so many things in terms
of other levels of consciousness and

1507
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,041
things of that nature.

1508
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:31,420
I've never even done mushrooms,

1509
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,380
so I'm like,

1510
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,790
I should go to shrimp fest.

1511
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,080
You should do shrimp festival.

1512
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,160
Ari Shaffir in the desert.

1513
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:36,940
He'd do it every year.

1514
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,650
He's been trying to get me to go.

1515
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,190
I would love,

1516
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,560
I would love to go like I've had.

1517
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,381
Why didn't you go?

1518
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:42,430
How come you haven't done so far?

1519
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,530
It's such bad experiences on drugs,

1520
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,730
but drugs just,

1521
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,080
we'd just,

1522
00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:47,321
we'd,

1523
00:39:47,321 --> 00:39:51,460
I've had that experiences like
panic attacks and anxiety attacks.

1524
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:52,721
It's the good stuff.

1525
00:39:52,721 --> 00:39:53,740
Then you're getting good shit.

1526
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:54,603
Oh,

1527
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:56,920
that's this podcast.

1528
00:39:56,921 --> 00:39:59,910
Pretty much every couple of weeks
all of us go into a panic attack.

1529
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:00,953
Fantastic.

1530
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,853
Yeah,

1531
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,160
there was one time,

1532
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,520
it was my birthday in Vegas and uh,

1533
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:07,180
I had,

1534
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,270
I was severely dehydrated and on top
of that I took away too much of a pot

1535
00:40:10,271 --> 00:40:15,271
cookie and a passed out at the Rio like
next to like next to a slot machine,

1536
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,020
like just collapsed.

1537
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:17,870
Like it was like a,

1538
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:20,950
like a Marion editor just
drop the puppet strings.

1539
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,910
It was sounds awesome.

1540
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,140
The weirdest thing is that like,

1541
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:26,590
first,

1542
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,401
like first of all,

1543
00:40:27,401 --> 00:40:28,450
it's Vegas.

1544
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,770
So people walk by,

1545
00:40:29,771 --> 00:40:31,390
they see a midget passed out in the real,

1546
00:40:31,391 --> 00:40:31,661
they're like,

1547
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:31,751
oh,

1548
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:32,680
that's a new exhibit.

1549
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:32,951
Oh,

1550
00:40:32,951 --> 00:40:33,784
that's funny.

1551
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,150
Getting anything out of it.

1552
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:36,481
Like,

1553
00:40:36,481 --> 00:40:39,340
did you like when you had
that experience and you,

1554
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:39,621
you know,

1555
00:40:39,621 --> 00:40:41,970
you have this panic
attack after it's over.

1556
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:44,040
Do you experience any,

1557
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,030
anything positive?

1558
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,373
Um,

1559
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,580
I wouldn't say I like,

1560
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:51,540
the only positivity I had was because I
went to the hospital and they pumped me

1561
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:54,630
soul full of fluids that
I felt so good afterward.

1562
00:40:54,631 --> 00:40:57,540
I was so hydrated that that felt amazing.

1563
00:40:57,541 --> 00:41:00,090
So they gave you an ivy and
the hospital gave me an ivy,

1564
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,560
but you'll be so dehydrated.

1565
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:06,150
I gotten a massage or early in the day
and I didn't like take and it was like

1566
00:41:06,151 --> 00:41:06,781
the deep tissue,

1567
00:41:06,781 --> 00:41:08,310
stuff like that,

1568
00:41:08,311 --> 00:41:10,680
like really sort of like you
need to drink water after that.

1569
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,200
You need to wait a minute.

1570
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,400
It's definitely not going to get you
that the somebody rubbing on your skin,

1571
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,040
they do into ringing you
out like a dish cloth.

1572
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:20,913
Exactly.

1573
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:21,541
Hey Joe,

1574
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:22,374
I'm very tiny.

1575
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,150
Holds a bottle of water.

1576
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,010
That doesn't make any sense.

1577
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:28,291
I mean,

1578
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:28,820
I,

1579
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,730
I mean to be honest with you,

1580
00:41:29,731 --> 00:41:34,070
I don't know when they tell you
after a massage drink bottled water.

1581
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,990
Most of that's bullshit.

1582
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:36,500
Really?

1583
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:36,771
Yeah.

1584
00:41:36,771 --> 00:41:39,740
What they're trying to tell
you is the get your toxins,

1585
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,150
toxins out of your system.

1586
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,350
I drink the water.

1587
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,550
I know that the whole toxins,

1588
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,560
toxic muscles are releasing toxins.

1589
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:48,920
Your body is fucking processing
toxins with your liver.

1590
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:49,400
Right.

1591
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,710
You know what happens when you get your,

1592
00:41:50,711 --> 00:41:51,710
your muscles rubbed.

1593
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,420
It breaks up your tissue a little bit.

1594
00:41:53,421 --> 00:41:53,750
It's,

1595
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:58,220
it's massaging soft tissue and loosens
things up and it makes you feel better.

1596
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:59,630
You should drink water anyway.

1597
00:41:59,720 --> 00:41:59,931
Sure.

1598
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:01,070
No water is good for you.

1599
00:42:01,071 --> 00:42:03,500
But I really don't believe that,

1600
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:03,890
you know,

1601
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,180
when you get a massage,

1602
00:42:05,181 --> 00:42:06,620
it's releasing toxins.

1603
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,041
I mean,

1604
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:08,210
maybe I'm wrong,

1605
00:42:08,211 --> 00:42:08,561
but I,

1606
00:42:08,561 --> 00:42:10,640
I just don't see how it could have.

1607
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:15,230
Some are rubbing your body can never
heard a doctor say that these toxins that

1608
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:18,140
are released when you have
a very strenuous exercise,

1609
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,810
like that's why those crossfit or people,

1610
00:42:20,811 --> 00:42:25,310
they get that rob Doe Mile Osis I
think that's how you say it Rhabdo is,

1611
00:42:25,311 --> 00:42:25,760
um,

1612
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,630
it's when your,

1613
00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:30,410
your kidneys start failing because
your kidneys can't process.

1614
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:30,831
Yeah.

1615
00:42:30,831 --> 00:42:31,041
Your,

1616
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:33,350
your muscles are breaking down and the,

1617
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:35,780
and your kidneys can't process all the,

1618
00:42:35,781 --> 00:42:35,961
uh,

1619
00:42:35,961 --> 00:42:37,910
the toxins and all the fluid.

1620
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,151
It's,

1621
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:38,421
yeah,

1622
00:42:38,421 --> 00:42:39,500
it's very dangerous.

1623
00:42:39,501 --> 00:42:40,040
And it's,

1624
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,920
it was really rare up until this crossfit,

1625
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:44,290
uh,

1626
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:45,123
sorta craze.

1627
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:47,200
But now when people go
to the hospital and they,

1628
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:51,590
they find that they're having kidney
failure and then they have this rob doe

1629
00:42:51,591 --> 00:42:53,600
meiosis or however the fuck you say it.

1630
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:55,060
And they always ask him,

1631
00:42:55,061 --> 00:42:56,030
why are you doing crossfit?

1632
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,470
Because crossfit,

1633
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,970
they're trying to get people to do like,

1634
00:42:58,971 --> 00:42:59,241
you know,

1635
00:42:59,241 --> 00:43:02,290
50 fucking clean and
presses in a row and it,

1636
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:02,720
you know,

1637
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,310
and they'll have
competitions with each other.

1638
00:43:04,311 --> 00:43:04,510
You're,

1639
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:07,040
you're pushing your body way past,

1640
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,630
like a workout limit.

1641
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:11,930
You're pushing your pot to the
point of like real failure.

1642
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:12,500
Yeah.

1643
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,690
You talked to a guy who's
done crossfit for 10 years.

1644
00:43:14,691 --> 00:43:18,680
It doesn't have like some significant
fucking injuries like significant back

1645
00:43:18,681 --> 00:43:19,130
injury,

1646
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:22,430
significant muscle tears or
something along those lines.

1647
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:23,780
I'm really glad you're saying this Joe,

1648
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:27,440
because now I could have a
legitimate reason to not do crossfit.

1649
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,120
Had not just that I'm a lazy fuck.

1650
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:32,870
Well my good friend is Steve Maxwell,

1651
00:43:32,871 --> 00:43:34,700
who's is really world renowned,

1652
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:35,060
uh,

1653
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:38,420
strength and conditioning coach and
he's worked with a lot of high level MMA

1654
00:43:38,421 --> 00:43:38,841
fighters.

1655
00:43:38,841 --> 00:43:42,530
He was one of the first Americans to get
his black belt in Jujitsu and he's just

1656
00:43:42,531 --> 00:43:47,531
this great guy and know so much about
martial arts and know so much about

1657
00:43:48,771 --> 00:43:51,890
strength and conditioning and
health and he fucking hates it.

1658
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,780
He thinks that what crossfit is,

1659
00:43:53,781 --> 00:43:57,470
he says you're doing a
competition to lift weights.

1660
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:58,520
He's like,

1661
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,470
unless you're doing like a power,

1662
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,910
like when you watch power lifting,

1663
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,560
they did do that once.

1664
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:05,240
It's like a one lift thing.

1665
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,430
Like when you're doing a
bunch of them in a row,

1666
00:44:07,431 --> 00:44:12,431
like what his take on it is
that weightlifting should
be to strengthen your body

1667
00:44:14,601 --> 00:44:15,470
for sports,

1668
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,110
strengthen your body for competition
and when you do a competition of weight,

1669
00:44:20,111 --> 00:44:20,950
weight lifting,

1670
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:21,531
he's like,

1671
00:44:21,531 --> 00:44:22,790
it's kind of ridiculous.

1672
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:25,970
It's Kinda defeats the purpose of strength
and conditioning in the first place.

1673
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,270
Like doing strength and
conditioning as a sport.

1674
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:29,991
He sees,

1675
00:44:29,991 --> 00:44:30,561
he's like,

1676
00:44:30,561 --> 00:44:31,381
it's kind of silly.

1677
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:32,070
It's like it's supposed

1678
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,450
to help sports.

1679
00:44:33,451 --> 00:44:35,100
It's not supposed to be the sport.

1680
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:35,880
Oh,

1681
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,450
okay.

1682
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:36,810
Yeah,

1683
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:37,411
that makes sense.

1684
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:41,250
The peony and there's other people that
have a similar criticism and their take

1685
00:44:41,251 --> 00:44:44,880
on it is that when you see
these big compound movements,

1686
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:45,750
like,

1687
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,850
like Olympic cleans and presses,

1688
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,010
like these are full body movements.

1689
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:54,600
Those are supposed to be done
with low repetition because yeah,

1690
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,280
well a few times maybe,

1691
00:44:56,281 --> 00:44:56,581
you know,

1692
00:44:56,581 --> 00:44:57,540
maybe a couple,

1693
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:01,620
but you're not supposed to
engage those muscles like that,

1694
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:02,940
like over and over and over again.

1695
00:45:02,941 --> 00:45:06,360
To the point of failure because
you're taking some big fucking risks.

1696
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:09,030
You're putting really heavy
weight over your head.

1697
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:09,511
You're,

1698
00:45:09,511 --> 00:45:09,781
you know,

1699
00:45:09,781 --> 00:45:12,950
you're throwing your back
into this it and well,

1700
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:13,260
yeah,

1701
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,440
you've seen all the youtube videos of
people like dropping the weight on their

1702
00:45:16,441 --> 00:45:17,274
necks or like,

1703
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:20,940
or like some people lose their bowels
while they're doing the weightlifting and

1704
00:45:20,941 --> 00:45:22,020
can only be so lucky.

1705
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:22,883
Yeah.

1706
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:23,670
I've,

1707
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:24,060
I've seen,

1708
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,170
I've seen those videos,

1709
00:45:25,171 --> 00:45:26,040
so yeah,

1710
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:26,920
like I,

1711
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,490
and Shocker,

1712
00:45:29,491 --> 00:45:30,211
I'm not a doctor,

1713
00:45:30,211 --> 00:45:30,830
but that,

1714
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:33,180
that that just doesn't seem right,

1715
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,310
that it doesn't seem like your
body should be doing that.

1716
00:45:35,311 --> 00:45:36,360
And then the other side,

1717
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,120
a side effect of crossfit is that,

1718
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:39,391
uh,

1719
00:45:39,391 --> 00:45:40,380
when you meet someone,

1720
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:42,000
the first sentence out of your mouth is,

1721
00:45:42,001 --> 00:45:42,870
I do crossfit.

1722
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:43,480
Yeah.

1723
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,180
That's usually people
just starting to do it,

1724
00:45:45,181 --> 00:45:45,361
you know,

1725
00:45:45,361 --> 00:45:46,230
it's like anything else.

1726
00:45:46,231 --> 00:45:49,260
People will just start to do it
to people just become a Vegan.

1727
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:49,780
You know,

1728
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,360
when people just got into yoga,

1729
00:45:51,361 --> 00:45:54,210
they all do the same shit and we all
just went into something that can't shut

1730
00:45:54,211 --> 00:45:54,991
the fuck up about it.

1731
00:45:54,991 --> 00:45:55,980
I've been guilty of that too.

1732
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:56,220
Oh,

1733
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:56,910
sure.

1734
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:58,080
Vegan crossfitter.

1735
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:58,421
Yeah.

1736
00:45:58,421 --> 00:46:00,960
It has to be the worst cross better.

1737
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,590
Wow.

1738
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:03,080
Yeah.

1739
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:03,690
It's interesting.

1740
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:07,500
It's just one of those things where a
lot of people are doing it and there are

1741
00:46:07,501 --> 00:46:08,334
benefits to it.

1742
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:10,890
There's benefits to any kind of exercise.

1743
00:46:10,891 --> 00:46:12,330
You're raising your heart rate up,

1744
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,710
you're getting your body to work,

1745
00:46:13,711 --> 00:46:15,420
your body's going to
break down and recover.

1746
00:46:15,421 --> 00:46:17,400
It's going to get stronger
because of that process.

1747
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:18,700
There's a lot of benefits to it.

1748
00:46:18,701 --> 00:46:20,160
It's just I,

1749
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:24,210
I'm very skeptical when I know so many
people that do it and they're all fucked

1750
00:46:24,211 --> 00:46:24,451
up.

1751
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:24,991
Like Eddie,

1752
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:26,100
if is all fucked up.

1753
00:46:26,101 --> 00:46:27,330
His back's our wreck.

1754
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,400
It's all and he used to totally be,

1755
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:29,761
oh,

1756
00:46:29,761 --> 00:46:30,541
I love crossfit.

1757
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:31,170
I love crossfit.

1758
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:31,531
Now he's like,

1759
00:46:31,531 --> 00:46:32,460
fuck crossfit.

1760
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:34,290
He's shit cast for that.

1761
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:34,650
Right?

1762
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:35,431
He's out of it now.

1763
00:46:35,431 --> 00:46:36,600
Like he started doing crossfit.

1764
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,310
He has this crossfit podcast.

1765
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:41,240
It has to be the most
amazing podcast in the room.

1766
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,110
Well for,

1767
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:46,230
well for call for crossfitters it is
because it's just an hour and a half of

1768
00:46:46,231 --> 00:46:47,400
talking about crossfit,

1769
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,750
like jerking off.

1770
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:52,340
Then you should work out of
the day to day or do box jumps

1771
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,480
and lifting up a trashcan with Kellen.

1772
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,121
You know there's,

1773
00:46:57,121 --> 00:46:58,200
this is probably good too.

1774
00:46:58,230 --> 00:46:59,220
There's some good to it.

1775
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:00,450
It's like everything else.

1776
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:02,040
You got to know like
everything in moderation,

1777
00:47:02,041 --> 00:47:02,400
right?

1778
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:02,641
Yeah.

1779
00:47:02,641 --> 00:47:05,280
I mean you can run an ultra
marathon if you're fucking crazy,

1780
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:09,480
but you can only do them like
once every few months if at all.

1781
00:47:09,481 --> 00:47:11,130
I have a friend and his,

1782
00:47:11,131 --> 00:47:11,580
um,

1783
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:12,271
anything that makes it,

1784
00:47:12,271 --> 00:47:15,300
his ran an ultra marathon
and she had kidney failure.

1785
00:47:15,301 --> 00:47:16,170
That was so bad.

1786
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:20,610
You could take your finger and push it
into her arm and it would stay like the

1787
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:23,760
dent would stay and then it
will like slowly come back up.

1788
00:47:23,761 --> 00:47:26,150
Like she was made out of
remember stretch Armstrong.

1789
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:26,520
Yeah.

1790
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,330
She was like,

1791
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:28,950
like human memory foams,

1792
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:32,830
dehydration right from your
kidney inflammation prize.

1793
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:37,150
She's a damn good massage from her kidneys
were failing so her body was swollen.

1794
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,520
Like everything was all
fucked up with fluids.

1795
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,031
It's just like,

1796
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,990
it's not good.

1797
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,510
My friend is going through
kidney failure right now.

1798
00:47:43,511 --> 00:47:43,940
She has,

1799
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:48,370
she's just got lupus and she's getting
all these infusions and stuff like that.

1800
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,680
His kidney something that you,

1801
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:50,471
you have two of them,

1802
00:47:50,471 --> 00:47:50,681
right?

1803
00:47:50,681 --> 00:47:52,710
So you can get rid of blinding and limit.

1804
00:47:52,711 --> 00:47:52,991
Okay.

1805
00:47:52,991 --> 00:47:54,530
Life at the other one are barely.

1806
00:47:54,531 --> 00:47:55,100
Okay.

1807
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:55,420
Yeah,

1808
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:56,860
but it's going to be compromised.

1809
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,730
Yeah.

1810
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:58,050
They'll,

1811
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:01,580
they'll probably be a moment where
you might wish you had to write.

1812
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:02,010
Is it,

1813
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:05,650
can you think you have to
be really careful about like
dehydration and drinking,

1814
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:06,493
drinking

1815
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:08,950
hand in hand.

1816
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:10,420
Our mutual friend been,

1817
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:10,840
uh,

1818
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,171
from the,

1819
00:48:11,171 --> 00:48:11,380
uh,

1820
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:12,340
Kevin being show has one,

1821
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:13,203
has one kidney.

1822
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,020
What Ha,

1823
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:14,700
what happened to him?

1824
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:14,920
Uh,

1825
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,470
he donated his kidney to a friend of his.

1826
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:18,731
That's awesome.

1827
00:48:18,731 --> 00:48:19,564
He's a sweetie.

1828
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:20,770
I love that dude.

1829
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:21,311
He's a,

1830
00:48:21,311 --> 00:48:24,700
he's a big Seattle proponent
to talk to that guy.

1831
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:25,031
I love you.

1832
00:48:25,031 --> 00:48:25,930
Moving up to Seattle.

1833
00:48:25,931 --> 00:48:27,010
He almost got me that.

1834
00:48:27,011 --> 00:48:27,910
Fuck Dude.

1835
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:31,780
I've got it up there to
friends that are like that.

1836
00:48:31,781 --> 00:48:32,471
I have been,

1837
00:48:32,471 --> 00:48:34,360
and then I have my podcast partner,

1838
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:34,960
um,

1839
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:35,590
Adam Ray,

1840
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:36,070
who's like,

1841
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:36,640
who?

1842
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,480
He's from Seattle.

1843
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:38,500
I fucking love Seattle.

1844
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:40,090
I just don't love cloudy weather.

1845
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:40,953
That's all.

1846
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,411
That's all.

1847
00:48:41,411 --> 00:48:42,550
I don't love about Seattle.

1848
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:43,660
I love the restaurants.

1849
00:48:43,661 --> 00:48:44,680
I love the people.

1850
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,390
I think it's a smart town.

1851
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:46,680
It's,

1852
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,550
it's less materialistic.

1853
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:53,551
It's less like focused on just plain
looks and attention and all the bullshit

1854
00:48:55,031 --> 00:48:56,470
that comes with this town.

1855
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:56,971
Yeah.

1856
00:48:56,971 --> 00:48:58,680
That you characterize for Hollywood.

1857
00:48:58,681 --> 00:49:01,450
Meaning we're kind of out of that loop
because we're comics and you know,

1858
00:49:01,451 --> 00:49:05,080
we hang around with the store and it's
just like we're barely in that loop,

1859
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:05,381
you know?

1860
00:49:05,381 --> 00:49:06,191
But God damn,

1861
00:49:06,191 --> 00:49:07,930
every now and then I dip my toe into it.

1862
00:49:07,931 --> 00:49:09,150
Like I'll go to a restaurant,

1863
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,360
I'll see Paparazzi in front
and people that are like just,

1864
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:13,720
just all that horse shit.

1865
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,160
It's just so stupid.

1866
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:16,990
The mind numbing.

1867
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:21,910
The most annoying part about the whole
la scene for me is talking to someone and

1868
00:49:21,911 --> 00:49:23,830
while I'm trying to make eye contact,

1869
00:49:23,831 --> 00:49:26,500
they are looking around for
the next person to talk to.

1870
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:27,970
Oh there's certain places,

1871
00:49:27,971 --> 00:49:31,540
if you go to certain places that's all
anyone is doing is looking for famous

1872
00:49:31,541 --> 00:49:34,240
people to walk in and then
they're going to go talk.

1873
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:34,511
Like,

1874
00:49:34,511 --> 00:49:34,751
okay,

1875
00:49:34,751 --> 00:49:36,430
like I'm talking to you
now because you've got,

1876
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:36,821
you know,

1877
00:49:36,821 --> 00:49:37,900
you've done a few things in your life,

1878
00:49:37,901 --> 00:49:39,760
but the next person that walks in,

1879
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:44,320
I guess I kind of get it because
it's sort of like birdwatching like,

1880
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:44,470
Ooh,

1881
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:45,303
there's a blue Jay.

1882
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,271
You know,

1883
00:49:46,271 --> 00:49:46,630
I mean,

1884
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:47,820
well who gives a fuck of a blue?

1885
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:48,581
Jay shows up.

1886
00:49:48,581 --> 00:49:48,791
I mean,

1887
00:49:48,791 --> 00:49:49,624
they're kind of pretty,

1888
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,790
but if Jennifer Lopez walks in like,

1889
00:49:51,791 --> 00:49:52,061
yeah,

1890
00:49:52,061 --> 00:49:53,020
he has his great

1891
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:56,250
45 farms to,

1892
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:56,950
they're like,

1893
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:57,221
oh,

1894
00:49:57,221 --> 00:49:57,881
there's the rare,

1895
00:49:57,881 --> 00:49:59,300
there's the rare Brad Williams

1896
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:01,300
funny.

1897
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,133
But,

1898
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:02,981
oh look over there.

1899
00:50:02,981 --> 00:50:03,760
Joe Rogan,

1900
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,440
larger large of the species.

1901
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:06,340
This is weird.

1902
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,380
So a brand used to be friends with Carlos.

1903
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:10,860
What did we still friends and
they'll still have this fucking,

1904
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,140
they'll have these
debates and one to ponder.

1905
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:13,361
Nah,

1906
00:50:13,361 --> 00:50:13,570
man.

1907
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:14,371
You know when I heard about,

1908
00:50:14,371 --> 00:50:15,490
I heard they had a falling out.

1909
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:20,080
Like there's certain people that are
experts on Lex celebrity relationships and

1910
00:50:20,081 --> 00:50:20,640
friendships.

1911
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:20,890
Oh,

1912
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:22,510
those people are fucking disgusting.

1913
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,471
Those people will,

1914
00:50:23,471 --> 00:50:26,680
she broke up with him because she found
out that he was text messaging and his

1915
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,523
excellent.

1916
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:28,490
Do you know?

1917
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:29,323
You don't know.

1918
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,680
You don't even know about your own life,

1919
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:31,190
right?

1920
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,930
You can't even fucking clean your car.

1921
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:35,890
Jamie shots fire.

1922
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:36,800
I wasn't talking about,

1923
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:37,863
damn,

1924
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:40,490
I didn't mean you Jenny the

1925
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:46,730
but right after Jamie just went pale
on us to see what is it at all more.

1926
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:47,540
Hey,

1927
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:48,470
he's a fucking,

1928
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:49,880
he's an enthusiast.

1929
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,760
I look at it like sometimes I'm mad.

1930
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:57,230
I'm mad that like the tweets that I
throw out there that get like the most

1931
00:50:57,350 --> 00:51:00,470
retweets and favorites are
like Kim Kardashian jokes.

1932
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,970
That's going to happen.

1933
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:02,450
I hate,

1934
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:03,980
I hate the fact that that's how it is.

1935
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:06,110
Like sometimes I write
like a tweet when I'm like,

1936
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:06,351
oh,

1937
00:51:06,351 --> 00:51:07,184
this is a good one.

1938
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,990
This is a good joke,

1939
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:13,910
fun one and then see that the
fucking director of x men,

1940
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:14,983
he quit.

1941
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:18,110
He quit Twitter because of all
the mean tweets that he got.

1942
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:19,160
It makes sense.

1943
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:22,280
It's all from social
justice warrior types.

1944
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,720
All these people that are angry,

1945
00:51:23,721 --> 00:51:28,721
they're calling him a
sexist and an ableist and
transphobic like all this crazy

1946
00:51:28,761 --> 00:51:28,911
shit.

1947
00:51:28,911 --> 00:51:29,744
This guy is,

1948
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:32,090
this guy calls himself a feminist.

1949
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:32,421
I mean,

1950
00:51:32,421 --> 00:51:34,070
he's like a really sweet,

1951
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:39,280
progressive guy and he got attacked
for the way he portrayed Scarlett

1952
00:51:40,491 --> 00:51:42,860
Johansson's character in the movie.

1953
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:45,440
It's so fucking crazy.

1954
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,090
Yeah.

1955
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:46,700
Like,

1956
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:46,911
well,

1957
00:51:46,911 --> 00:51:48,170
it was that whole thing where,

1958
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:48,730
uh,

1959
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:48,951
what,

1960
00:51:48,951 --> 00:51:49,450
what was it,

1961
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:50,283
the,

1962
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:50,870
uh,

1963
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:52,780
Chris Evans and uh,

1964
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:52,991
they,

1965
00:51:52,991 --> 00:51:53,221
they,

1966
00:51:53,221 --> 00:51:53,380
they,

1967
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:56,740
they got attacked because they
called a fictional character.

1968
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:58,000
They call it,

1969
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:58,370
yeah.

1970
00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:00,470
They called Scarlett
Johansson's character a slut.

1971
00:52:00,471 --> 00:52:00,980
And they're like,

1972
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,480
that's that slut shaming.

1973
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:03,523
Whew.

1974
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,840
It's not even real.

1975
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:06,501
Like,

1976
00:52:06,501 --> 00:52:10,280
so if I call the Easter
bunny a cocksucker,

1977
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,870
are you going to come
after me and be like,

1978
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:12,350
well,

1979
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:14,770
that's just gay bashing God.

1980
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:15,321
No,

1981
00:52:15,321 --> 00:52:16,870
it doesn't exist.

1982
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,110
There was some money.

1983
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:22,500
Got this one guy who's like
a famous social justice war.

1984
00:52:22,501 --> 00:52:23,840
He's such a Twat.

1985
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,250
And he was,

1986
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:30,380
he was typing in all this shit and
putting all these tweets about x men ultra

1987
00:52:31,611 --> 00:52:33,530
about it being violent and
all these different things.

1988
00:52:33,531 --> 00:52:33,890
Like,

1989
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:35,810
do you know what the fuck you went to see?

1990
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:39,470
It's a God damn comic book Dork.

1991
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,790
You didn't go see a,

1992
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:44,360
you didn't go see Anthony
Hopkins in remains of the day.

1993
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,550
Like you're seeing a fucking x men movie.

1994
00:52:46,551 --> 00:52:49,030
He was comparing it to um,

1995
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,780
it was really hilarious actually.

1996
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,960
He was comparing it to war and like the
attitudes that we have on the military,

1997
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,890
invasion of other countries,

1998
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:01,500
use of aggression like the
fuck are you talking about him?

1999
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,140
Isn't that a guy you blocked on Twitter?

2000
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:04,070
And then like he talked to me.

2001
00:53:04,071 --> 00:53:04,641
I serious.

2002
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:05,474
He blocked me.

2003
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:07,850
I won't mention his name.

2004
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:08,690
He's like candy man.

2005
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,550
I won't mention his name
because he's such a Dork.

2006
00:53:10,551 --> 00:53:11,480
He showed you Joe.

2007
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:14,270
But he blocked me without
me even mentioning his name.

2008
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,130
I don't mention any of
these guys' names anymore.

2009
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:17,840
I like a lot of these guys.

2010
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,050
This is why I know that
their attention horse,

2011
00:53:21,051 --> 00:53:23,750
because all of their
posts are complaining,

2012
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,280
that's all they're doing is complaining.

2013
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,153
You're not everyday,

2014
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:27,630
not only not creating,

2015
00:53:27,631 --> 00:53:28,464
you're not contributing.

2016
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:31,200
You are just fucking
bitching all the time.

2017
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,000
What a miserable you have to be.

2018
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:35,160
We live in an amazing time.

2019
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:35,400
Yeah,

2020
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:35,731
but mate,

2021
00:53:35,731 --> 00:53:37,380
you can get video on your phone.

2022
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:38,050
You go outside,

2023
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:39,040
you hear birds Chirp,

2024
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:39,691
you meet people,

2025
00:53:39,691 --> 00:53:40,524
you'll hug them.

2026
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:45,630
All you're doing is complaining about
a fucking cartoon movie of cartoonish

2027
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:50,880
Comic Book Movie as if somehow now this
is the degradation of the moral fiber of

2028
00:53:50,881 --> 00:53:54,030
our culture and the degrading of women.

2029
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:58,860
A dehumanizing is their message
behind the hulk smashing a Mercedes.

2030
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:01,290
Is that that we need to
not buy foreign cars?

2031
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:01,621
No,

2032
00:54:01,621 --> 00:54:03,540
it's cause it looked
fucking cool comments.

2033
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,170
That's it.

2034
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:05,010
It's constant.

2035
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:09,180
The world's filled with comments someone
gave me the best advice I ever got for

2036
00:54:09,181 --> 00:54:11,160
being in show business is Brad.

2037
00:54:11,161 --> 00:54:11,994
Just remember,

2038
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,980
nobody cares about you.

2039
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:15,120
That's not true.

2040
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,110
That's advice sucks.

2041
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:17,760
I said that was by shitting on you.

2042
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:21,780
I love that advice and not fucking with
your parents tell you that every day of

2043
00:54:21,781 --> 00:54:22,614
my life.

2044
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:24,900
Like I love that advice.

2045
00:54:24,901 --> 00:54:27,000
Not for the fact that
nobody cares in terms of,

2046
00:54:27,001 --> 00:54:29,310
no one loves you or anything like that.

2047
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:32,490
But a lot of these people get in
their own heads and it's very,

2048
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,130
it's very narcissistic where it's like,

2049
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:38,820
oh this person tweeted
this so this offends me.

2050
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,680
Or how does this affect me?

2051
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:42,630
Or this person didn't
book me on this show.

2052
00:54:42,631 --> 00:54:44,370
So he is mad at me.

2053
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,030
It's like,

2054
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:48,750
or there's 22 million comics in La and
he didn't put on the show that week.

2055
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:49,710
Come down.

2056
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:50,041
Okay.

2057
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:51,300
You're talking about
totally different things.

2058
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:51,630
Yeah,

2059
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:51,781
yeah,

2060
00:54:51,781 --> 00:54:52,080
yeah,

2061
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:52,261
yeah.

2062
00:54:52,261 --> 00:54:55,380
You're just talking about people who are
just egomaniacs and completely obsessed

2063
00:54:55,381 --> 00:54:56,011
with themselves.

2064
00:54:56,011 --> 00:54:58,230
Don't be that Jamie,

2065
00:54:58,270 --> 00:54:59,071
can you make some team,

2066
00:54:59,071 --> 00:54:59,311
man,

2067
00:54:59,311 --> 00:55:01,290
I got some fucking crazy
phlegm going on here.

2068
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:02,413
Yeah.

2069
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:03,240
Like,

2070
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:03,730
uh,

2071
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:06,150
I've got a comic friend
of mine and she told me,

2072
00:55:06,151 --> 00:55:06,630
she's like,

2073
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:07,321
I don't know.

2074
00:55:07,321 --> 00:55:10,500
I'm really stressing over the fact that
some people said something about my

2075
00:55:10,501 --> 00:55:12,420
Twitter avatar picture and,

2076
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,700
and I think it's holding
you back in this business.

2077
00:55:14,701 --> 00:55:17,540
I'm like holding me back
in the show business.

2078
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:19,060
No,

2079
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:20,190
you're just talking to idiots.

2080
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:21,961
It's not,

2081
00:55:21,961 --> 00:55:25,980
no one's gonna hire you and then looks
at your Twitter avatar photo and says,

2082
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:26,420
oh,

2083
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,270
can't hire that person.

2084
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:29,700
There are people that do believe
that those people that believe,

2085
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:29,911
you know,

2086
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:31,530
you have to have the perfect headshot.

2087
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,600
You have to have this and that.

2088
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:34,070
I don't even have a fucking headshot.

2089
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:34,913
I need to get one.

2090
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:35,903
I didn't get them together.

2091
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:36,421
No,

2092
00:55:36,421 --> 00:55:36,661
I mean,

2093
00:55:36,661 --> 00:55:38,820
I kind of have a photo
that I use for Twitter.

2094
00:55:38,821 --> 00:55:40,950
That's my profile picture on Twitter.

2095
00:55:40,951 --> 00:55:41,700
That's probably it.

2096
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:42,570
Kind of a headshot.

2097
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:43,800
But like when people say,

2098
00:55:43,801 --> 00:55:44,041
oh,

2099
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:45,000
we need a headshot for club,

2100
00:55:45,001 --> 00:55:47,130
they used headshots are
fucking 15 years old.

2101
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,053
I got to get new ones.

2102
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:48,953
Yeah.

2103
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:51,930
Anything with hair is
old San Francisco ones.

2104
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:52,210
Yeah,

2105
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:52,540
I,

2106
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:53,251
I've been,

2107
00:55:53,251 --> 00:55:53,911
the clubs are like,

2108
00:55:53,911 --> 00:55:55,770
and then Joe Rogan's gonna come here
and then they've got you with hair.

2109
00:55:55,771 --> 00:55:57,420
I'm like with a leather jacket.

2110
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:58,533
Andre

2111
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:03,360
plays to be like your
news radio promo pick.

2112
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:03,931
You're like,

2113
00:56:03,931 --> 00:56:04,411
really dude,

2114
00:56:04,411 --> 00:56:07,950
you couldn't find anything else
while there's just so many fucking,

2115
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:08,720
you know,

2116
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:08,970
there's,

2117
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:12,680
there's so many people out there that
have ideas of like what you need to do as,

2118
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:14,400
as a comic or an actor,

2119
00:56:14,401 --> 00:56:15,234
like what you need to do.

2120
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:17,530
And it's because they're trying
to figure out themselves.

2121
00:56:17,531 --> 00:56:21,310
So part of it they're trying to like
justify their own choices with you,

2122
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,130
you know?

2123
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:22,400
Well,

2124
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:22,720
you know,

2125
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:23,120
I just,

2126
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,040
I feel like this is

2127
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,980
holding you back or I feel like this is
holding me back and they're trying to

2128
00:56:26,981 --> 00:56:27,814
figure it out.

2129
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:28,773
So they talking,

2130
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:29,880
they just mom died.

2131
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:32,710
I just put it out there just so
hopefully they come up with the answer.

2132
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:33,470
Yeah,

2133
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:35,110
they're exercising their own anxiety,

2134
00:56:35,111 --> 00:56:35,361
man.

2135
00:56:35,361 --> 00:56:36,940
It's just fucking Dudee pitches.

2136
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:39,280
The world's filled with nutty bitches,

2137
00:56:39,281 --> 00:56:39,580
bro.

2138
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:40,600
That's really what's going on.

2139
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:41,920
I would wholeheartedly agree.

2140
00:56:41,921 --> 00:56:42,550
Joe Rogan,

2141
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:45,790
this poor fucking Josh
Weeden guy or Joss Whedon.

2142
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:46,903
How'd he say we?

2143
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:48,700
W.

2144
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:48,700
H.

2145
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:48,700
E.

2146
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:48,700
D.

2147
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:48,700
O.

2148
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:48,720
N.

2149
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,553
How do you say that?

2150
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:50,261
Who is this person?

2151
00:56:50,261 --> 00:56:52,240
This is the guy that directed the x man.

2152
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:56,200
I read some of the tweets and holy
fuck did they go after this guy?

2153
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:59,140
But if that happens to me all
the time and you just block it,

2154
00:56:59,141 --> 00:57:00,040
you don't quit Twitter,

2155
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,030
why would you quit Twitter?

2156
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,230
Why wouldn't you just block that shit?

2157
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:03,460
Cause he's tired of assholes.

2158
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:08,820
I think when it becomes part of your
day to go through your Twitter and like,

2159
00:57:09,101 --> 00:57:09,491
okay blah,

2160
00:57:09,491 --> 00:57:09,901
blah blah,

2161
00:57:09,901 --> 00:57:10,121
blah,

2162
00:57:10,121 --> 00:57:10,540
blah.

2163
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:11,770
Like when that becomes,

2164
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:16,300
when it's adding stress that you don't
have to have and just doesn't need

2165
00:57:16,301 --> 00:57:17,134
Twitter,

2166
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,340
he directs movies.

2167
00:57:18,341 --> 00:57:19,510
He makes a ton of money.

2168
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:20,673
Good for you.

2169
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:23,320
Well I think that some times it's great.

2170
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:24,370
I love Twitter.

2171
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,440
I love communicating with people online.

2172
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:26,741
It just,

2173
00:57:26,741 --> 00:57:28,650
you take a risk that you're
going to run into cunts.

2174
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:29,170
Yep.

2175
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:31,150
And if you only run into my,

2176
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:32,910
my opinion on the,

2177
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,690
the amount of people that suck is,

2178
00:57:34,691 --> 00:57:35,950
it's a very small amount,

2179
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,660
but if there are vocally active,

2180
00:57:37,661 --> 00:57:38,620
very small amount,

2181
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,970
if you look at some of these people,

2182
00:57:39,971 --> 00:57:42,340
like we were talking about the
social justice warrior guys,

2183
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:47,670
that guy had fucking 15 tweets about x
men and I'm not bullshitting 15 tweets

2184
00:57:49,151 --> 00:57:50,590
about how horrible it was.

2185
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:55,660
Sexist and ablest and all this different
stupid fucking shit that if you are one

2186
00:57:57,101 --> 00:57:59,910
person and you have all
these comments on the,

2187
00:57:59,911 --> 00:58:02,710
the horrible nature of
this one particular thing,

2188
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:05,500
it's like this guy runs
into that and he's,

2189
00:58:05,501 --> 00:58:05,891
you know,

2190
00:58:05,891 --> 00:58:07,090
he's fucking tired of,

2191
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,110
he doesn't want to deal.

2192
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:09,143
And there's a,

2193
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:10,810
I mean it's,

2194
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,870
it's strange because all
these social media platforms,

2195
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:14,290
like,

2196
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:14,680
like,

2197
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,101
like you say,

2198
00:58:15,101 --> 00:58:18,610
there are unbelievable in terms of the
fact that you can communicate with anyone

2199
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:23,650
you could get because before you didn't
know how to get an access to someone

2200
00:58:23,651 --> 00:58:26,170
that you were a fan of or
that you watched on TV,

2201
00:58:26,171 --> 00:58:27,100
you would know how to do it.

2202
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:28,690
Like you got to go through a publicist,

2203
00:58:28,691 --> 00:58:29,050
you gotta write,

2204
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:30,190
you gotta write a fan club,

2205
00:58:30,191 --> 00:58:31,180
and then you like,

2206
00:58:31,181 --> 00:58:32,410
you didn't know what to do.

2207
00:58:32,411 --> 00:58:35,320
Now you can instantly say
something to anyone and it ended,

2208
00:58:35,321 --> 00:58:37,750
they had a good possibility of seeing it.

2209
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,000
That part is unbelievable,

2210
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:44,950
but then you have so much else that comes
with it where now because people have

2211
00:58:44,951 --> 00:58:45,581
that voice now,

2212
00:58:45,581 --> 00:58:49,900
they feel like people need to hear their
voice constantly in whatever topic that

2213
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:50,501
might be,

2214
00:58:50,501 --> 00:58:51,334
whether it be,

2215
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,650
I got offended at this personal thing.

2216
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:56,440
Everyone needs to know I
was offending like that.

2217
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:01,360
And we acknowledge they're there trying
to get social points so when they're

2218
00:59:01,361 --> 00:59:04,840
complaining about something or calling
something sexist or calling something

2219
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:06,850
homophobic or whatever they're doing.

2220
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:07,450
Sure.

2221
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:08,830
Sometimes they're complaining,

2222
00:59:08,831 --> 00:59:13,300
but oftentimes what they're doing is
they're trying to show you that they know

2223
00:59:13,301 --> 00:59:14,350
that something's bad,

2224
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:16,930
which makes them have a high moral fiber.

2225
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:20,980
They're trying to show you that they're
a very moral person with really strong,

2226
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:25,760
intelligent opinions and that these ass
holes is it all the time and are talls

2227
00:59:25,761 --> 00:59:27,230
that are ruining the world.

2228
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,760
They're below that.

2229
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:33,850
I get that because I say the word midget
a lot and that is apparently a horrible

2230
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:34,581
word dude.

2231
00:59:34,581 --> 00:59:37,130
You gotta fucking green light to say
midget like I got a green light to say

2232
00:59:37,131 --> 00:59:37,964
Guinea

2233
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:41,750
and then when he gets mad at me
for calling Italians guineas,

2234
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:42,140
no,

2235
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:43,250
my last name is Rogan.

2236
00:59:43,251 --> 00:59:44,300
I am mostly Italian.

2237
00:59:44,301 --> 00:59:45,500
So fuck you.

2238
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:46,940
And if you don't think they're guineas,

2239
00:59:46,941 --> 00:59:48,500
you need to meet my fucking relatives.

2240
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,830
I'll show you some pictures of
some grown men with gold chains.

2241
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:52,690
Okay.

2242
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:53,150
Like,

2243
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:53,471
yeah,

2244
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:57,410
but I get attacked all the time for say
for saying the word midget in my act and

2245
00:59:57,411 --> 00:59:58,244
it's just like,

2246
00:59:58,650 --> 00:59:59,260
and,

2247
00:59:59,260 --> 00:59:59,780
and,

2248
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:00,650
and people say like,

2249
01:00:00,651 --> 01:00:01,010
don't,

2250
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:03,940
aren't you concerned about the
message that you're sending up?

2251
01:00:03,941 --> 01:00:05,240
This word is okay.

2252
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:05,931
I was like,

2253
01:00:05,931 --> 01:00:06,561
I don't,

2254
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:07,610
why is it bad?

2255
01:00:07,611 --> 01:00:10,160
I'm still trying to figure out
why people don't like that word.

2256
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:10,960
Well,

2257
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:11,330
I don't know.

2258
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:13,040
I think it's a language police issue.

2259
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:14,870
There's people that try
to get rid of bossy.

2260
01:00:14,871 --> 01:00:15,704
Remember that?

2261
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:18,080
Tried to get rid of Bossy
a couple of years ago.

2262
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,630
It gave it a hard push
to and everybody went,

2263
01:00:20,631 --> 01:00:21,464
fuck,

2264
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:22,343
fuck you.

2265
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:23,211
No,

2266
01:00:23,211 --> 01:00:24,044
that's enough.

2267
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:28,490
I think we need to do that on a lot
of people complaining about sir,

2268
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:31,400
about certain words that we
can't say that shows you like,

2269
01:00:31,401 --> 01:00:33,240
why would anybody want
to get rid of bossy?

2270
01:00:33,241 --> 01:00:34,940
Is bossy really so strong.

2271
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:35,570
You know what,

2272
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:36,440
and it was,

2273
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:37,970
it was a sexist or something.

2274
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:41,450
They were saying that they're used
the word bossy to describe women,

2275
01:00:41,451 --> 01:00:45,260
the women that are powerful or
women that are strong and in charge,

2276
01:00:45,261 --> 01:00:49,880
that they're bossy and that
you're demeaning them and
trying to marginalize them

2277
01:00:49,881 --> 01:00:50,714
and some sort of way.

2278
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:51,471
And you know,

2279
01:00:51,471 --> 01:00:52,110
women were like,

2280
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:53,360
get the fuck Outta here.

2281
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:56,090
She's Ban Bossy with a little boy,

2282
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:57,080
asserts himself.

2283
01:00:57,081 --> 01:00:58,100
He's called a leader.

2284
01:00:58,250 --> 01:00:58,491
Yet.

2285
01:00:58,491 --> 01:00:59,570
When a girl does it,

2286
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:01,220
she's risk being branded,

2287
01:01:01,221 --> 01:01:02,054
bossy,

2288
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:03,020
where it's like Bossy,

2289
01:01:03,021 --> 01:01:03,801
send a message,

2290
01:01:03,801 --> 01:01:06,680
don't raise your hand or
speak up by middle school.

2291
01:01:06,681 --> 01:01:09,080
Girls are less interested
in leading than boys.

2292
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:10,100
Listen man,

2293
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:10,580
there's,

2294
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:14,480
there's a lot of that that's social and
there's a lot of that that's learned

2295
01:01:14,481 --> 01:01:18,350
behavior and there's a lot of that
that's biological and that's a fact and

2296
01:01:18,351 --> 01:01:21,620
that's why it's exists
in almost every culture.

2297
01:01:21,621 --> 01:01:23,660
There's very few matriarchal cultures,

2298
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:27,680
very few cultures that are run by women
and that doesn't mean that women are

2299
01:01:27,681 --> 01:01:28,470
less than men.

2300
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:33,200
That just means that you
got to stop trying to make
everybody even because we're

2301
01:01:33,201 --> 01:01:33,531
not,

2302
01:01:33,531 --> 01:01:35,780
even when it comes to child rearing,

2303
01:01:35,781 --> 01:01:36,171
we're not,

2304
01:01:36,171 --> 01:01:37,790
even when it comes to breastfeeding,

2305
01:01:37,791 --> 01:01:40,310
when not even when it comes to nurturing,

2306
01:01:40,311 --> 01:01:40,671
we're not,

2307
01:01:40,671 --> 01:01:42,830
even when it comes to
emotional intelligence,

2308
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:47,180
women are superior to men at a
lot of ways in ended and you know,

2309
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,490
if you try to make everybody the same,

2310
01:01:49,491 --> 01:01:52,630
you're going to have a fucking
bullshit world that doesn't exist.

2311
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:52,910
Right.

2312
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:54,850
If you say like,

2313
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:59,480
I think there was a story recently about
a woman firefighter that got hired just

2314
01:01:59,481 --> 01:02:04,481
because like they needed
a woman firefighter and
it's like that you're going

2315
01:02:04,701 --> 01:02:07,520
down a slope where it's like if
I'm stuck in a burning building,

2316
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:08,570
like,

2317
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:09,050
hey,

2318
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:09,883
if she can,

2319
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:11,030
if she can run up there,

2320
01:02:11,031 --> 01:02:11,990
granted I don't weigh a lot,

2321
01:02:11,991 --> 01:02:15,950
but so if she can come up there and throw
me over her shoulder and get me out of

2322
01:02:15,951 --> 01:02:16,910
there just as fast,

2323
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:18,110
fantastic,

2324
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,273
awesome.

2325
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:20,460
I want her there.

2326
01:02:20,461 --> 01:02:23,400
Then if you're just
trying to fill a quota,

2327
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:24,990
if you're like,

2328
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:25,320
well,

2329
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:25,830
like,

2330
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:26,630
uh,

2331
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:26,940
uh,

2332
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:27,840
Hbo Sports,

2333
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:28,651
just,

2334
01:02:28,651 --> 01:02:29,760
it's something where it was like,

2335
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:30,100
uh,

2336
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:30,630
there's not,

2337
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:32,370
there's not enough blacks in baseball.

2338
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:34,580
Like there's not enough
black people in baseball.

2339
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:36,930
We need to get more
black people in baseball.

2340
01:02:36,931 --> 01:02:37,141
It's like,

2341
01:02:37,141 --> 01:02:37,501
well,

2342
01:02:37,501 --> 01:02:40,560
if the Dominican's can
throw faster and hit harder,

2343
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,030
that's who I want.

2344
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:42,863
And baseball.

2345
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:43,501
Fine.

2346
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:43,951
You know what,

2347
01:02:43,951 --> 01:02:44,310
man,

2348
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:45,300
why are you forcing it?

2349
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:45,930
I don't think,

2350
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:48,180
well I think there's
certain issues with uh,

2351
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:52,320
with sports where there is some sort
of segregation or there is some sort of

2352
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:56,850
discrimination and I don't
know that that's one of them.

2353
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,300
I don't know if they're trying
to keep black people out of,

2354
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:02,820
I bet polo now how many fucking
black people playing polo?

2355
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:04,140
You might want to look in a polo.

2356
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:06,090
Yeah,

2357
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:07,310
well cricket is a lot of,

2358
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:09,360
a lot of people of color
because a lot of Indians.

2359
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:09,810
Yeah.

2360
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:11,430
People in India love cricket man.

2361
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:13,380
They would like some of the best
cricket players in the world.

2362
01:03:13,381 --> 01:03:16,680
That was that stupid movie where they
recruited a cricket players to come over

2363
01:03:16,681 --> 01:03:17,610
to America to pitch.

2364
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,880
Remember that stupid movie Jon Hamm?

2365
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:24,490
It's like a love story because the name
is a guy and a girl and like he loves,

2366
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:24,980
you know,

2367
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:25,590
he,

2368
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:29,370
he was struggling trying
to get it together and the
fucking girl and him fall in

2369
01:03:29,371 --> 01:03:31,590
love and the Indian guys helped him.

2370
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:32,041
You know what?

2371
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,210
I'm going to start my own campaign.

2372
01:03:33,211 --> 01:03:34,830
There's not enough dwarves and baseball.

2373
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:35,880
There's not,

2374
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:36,391
there's not,

2375
01:03:36,391 --> 01:03:36,631
there's not,

2376
01:03:36,631 --> 01:03:37,260
there's not enough.

2377
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:38,093
How about any sport?

2378
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:38,311
Yeah,

2379
01:03:38,311 --> 01:03:38,611
we're not,

2380
01:03:38,611 --> 01:03:38,821
we're,

2381
01:03:38,821 --> 01:03:40,290
we're not represented.

2382
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:40,531
Uh,

2383
01:03:40,531 --> 01:03:40,920
there's,

2384
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:41,640
there's none.

2385
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:42,660
There's none in the NBA.

2386
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:43,650
You know,

2387
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:45,390
w w w you know the fuck Joe.

2388
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:47,030
What the fuck indeed.

2389
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:48,170
What the fucking deal,

2390
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,440
what's wrong with my people?

2391
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:49,810
Well,

2392
01:03:49,810 --> 01:03:53,280
and then if you sit like when transgender
people get into women's sports,

2393
01:03:53,281 --> 01:03:54,240
if you don't support that,

2394
01:03:54,241 --> 01:03:55,170
then you're a piece of shit.

2395
01:03:55,171 --> 01:03:55,410
Like,

2396
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:55,980
okay,

2397
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:56,520
you got,

2398
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:56,761
yeah,

2399
01:03:56,761 --> 01:03:57,720
you got a lot of flack for that,

2400
01:03:57,721 --> 01:03:58,020
didn't you?

2401
01:03:58,020 --> 01:03:58,853
It was just,

2402
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,300
just a fighter thing.

2403
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:01,590
Just the one about the woman.

2404
01:04:01,591 --> 01:04:01,651
I'm,

2405
01:04:01,651 --> 01:04:06,651
I'm pretty much cool with it and almost
every other way we did talk about that

2406
01:04:06,751 --> 01:04:08,400
woman who used to be a man.

2407
01:04:08,401 --> 01:04:11,730
It was six foot six and 50 years
old is playing college basketball,

2408
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,200
which I think is ridiculous.

2409
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:13,831
First of all,

2410
01:04:13,831 --> 01:04:14,580
because she,

2411
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:17,670
she essentially has given
a Redo for her whole life.

2412
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:19,560
She already used up or college credits.

2413
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:19,981
Like,

2414
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:20,161
you know,

2415
01:04:20,161 --> 01:04:21,990
you can only play college
sports for so long,

2416
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:23,123
but the,

2417
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,350
the dig is,

2418
01:04:25,351 --> 01:04:29,400
or the loophole is you can only
play college sports as a man.

2419
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:31,800
Now when you change your
name and become a woman,

2420
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:34,620
now all of a sudden you get a
whole new college sports career.

2421
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:35,550
Yes.

2422
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:38,130
So this man lived as a man,

2423
01:04:38,131 --> 01:04:39,930
played sports as a man,

2424
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:42,600
live to be 50 got a sex change,

2425
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,280
which I'm fully in support of.

2426
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:47,130
This is what I want to say
is this is super important.

2427
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:50,760
I'm not in any way saying that
someone shouldn't be able to do that,

2428
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:53,730
but what I am saying is when it
comes to athletic competition,

2429
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:57,720
you've got a 50 year old man
playing fucking college basketball.

2430
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:00,360
Get an 18 year old girls
if that's your daughter,

2431
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:00,871
okay.

2432
01:05:00,871 --> 01:05:01,650
And your daughter,

2433
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:05,220
she can't perform to the best of her
abilities because it's unfair because you

2434
01:05:05,221 --> 01:05:07,050
have this giant fucking man,

2435
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:12,470
you know who's now a woman who's 50
who's been had full testosterone for 47

2436
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:18,310
fucking years or whatever the hell it is
before she became a man or it became a

2437
01:05:18,311 --> 01:05:18,671
woman.

2438
01:05:18,671 --> 01:05:19,720
Like that's crazy.

2439
01:05:19,721 --> 01:05:19,881
Like,

2440
01:05:19,881 --> 01:05:20,200
yeah,

2441
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:20,440
you're,

2442
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:23,320
that's where sensitivity and
progressiveness goes too far,

2443
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:25,540
but at least then no one's getting hurt.

2444
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:26,853
Right?

2445
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:28,180
Where's the fight game?

2446
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:28,811
Yeah,

2447
01:05:28,811 --> 01:05:29,231
that's it.

2448
01:05:29,231 --> 01:05:32,800
I had a huge fucking problem with
and still do and most people do too.

2449
01:05:32,801 --> 01:05:33,634
And by the way,

2450
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:36,940
a lot of fucking transgender
people have an issue with that.

2451
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:39,000
The people don't have
an issue with that or,

2452
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:42,670
or have an issue with me
are the super progressive,

2453
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:47,110
ultra liberal social justice
warrior types who just don't have,

2454
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:48,610
they don't have a dog in the fight.

2455
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:52,450
They just not even that mad just saying
they want the opportunity to call

2456
01:05:52,451 --> 01:05:53,370
someone a big,

2457
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:54,550
they can't wait.

2458
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:56,260
They just can't wait to get upset.

2459
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:59,230
And just looking for the opportunity
to call someone a piece of shit.

2460
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:00,520
I was like,

2461
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:01,413
I was,

2462
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:06,370
cause there's actually a surgery that
you can have to lengthen your limbs.

2463
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:07,650
And I've seen that a,

2464
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:08,773
oh,

2465
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:09,731
it's rough.

2466
01:06:09,731 --> 01:06:10,121
Fuck Dude.

2467
01:06:10,121 --> 01:06:11,260
It's freaky likes forever.

2468
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:11,620
Yeah,

2469
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:12,580
it takes forever.

2470
01:06:12,581 --> 01:06:13,520
And uh,

2471
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:14,250
and you're in pain.

2472
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:18,880
It's literally they put braces
on your arms and legs every day.

2473
01:06:18,881 --> 01:06:23,881
You turn a little crank and crank
separates your bones by a mill of the,

2474
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:25,390
cut your bones,

2475
01:06:25,391 --> 01:06:27,070
first of all your bones.

2476
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:29,770
And then they put this crazy
brace with these screws on it.

2477
01:06:29,771 --> 01:06:32,860
They did this guy in China who
couldn't get a girlfriend and you know,

2478
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:37,450
he changed his height from like
four foot 11 until like five,

2479
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:37,961
three,

2480
01:06:37,961 --> 01:06:39,580
but it took years,

2481
01:06:39,581 --> 01:06:41,230
took years and I was in agony.

2482
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:46,290
Every day you're breaking your arm
and leg and the bone grows and regrows

2483
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:48,000
overnight.

2484
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:48,833
And uh,

2485
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:51,680
like we were talking
about the bill burbot um,

2486
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:53,140
earlier where it's like,

2487
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:53,470
hey,

2488
01:06:53,470 --> 01:06:55,150
just wait until they get good at it.

2489
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:58,480
Fucking wait until they get good at
the limb lengthening surgery guys.

2490
01:06:58,660 --> 01:06:59,500
Holy Shit.

2491
01:06:59,501 --> 01:07:00,670
Cause I've seen the people,

2492
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:02,060
there's no other alternatives though.

2493
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:04,323
I don't like that.

2494
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:05,740
I would never,

2495
01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:06,670
I would never get that.

2496
01:07:06,671 --> 01:07:09,040
I do not need to ride a
roller coaster that bat.

2497
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:09,903
Okay.

2498
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:11,410
But let me ask you this.

2499
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,550
If they could do it,

2500
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:15,220
like say if they could do it
and it was a onetime thing.

2501
01:07:15,221 --> 01:07:15,761
It took a year.

2502
01:07:15,761 --> 01:07:19,750
Like I had ACL reconstruction that
took like six months and someone said,

2503
01:07:19,751 --> 01:07:20,141
Oh man,

2504
01:07:20,141 --> 01:07:21,040
I wouldn't even get the surgery.

2505
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:21,311
I'm like,

2506
01:07:21,311 --> 01:07:23,830
but I go through the six months
and then my knee works again.

2507
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:24,250
Yeah.

2508
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:25,570
Like if someone could do that,

2509
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:29,740
if they could give you a surgery and
you'd be in pain for like a year,

2510
01:07:29,741 --> 01:07:32,200
but after that year you would be,

2511
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:32,860
you know,

2512
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:33,101
five,

2513
01:07:33,101 --> 01:07:33,431
six,

2514
01:07:33,431 --> 01:07:33,960
whatever,

2515
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:34,793
whatever.

2516
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:35,230
See,

2517
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:36,220
that's a really interesting question.

2518
01:07:36,221 --> 01:07:36,731
First of all,

2519
01:07:36,731 --> 01:07:38,350
I'd have to write a whole new act,

2520
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,353
which is,

2521
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:40,571
well,

2522
01:07:40,571 --> 01:07:42,750
I mean we'd write an act about
how you used to be a dwarf.

2523
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:43,090
Yeah,

2524
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:43,751
exactly right.

2525
01:07:43,751 --> 01:07:44,620
Crazy operation.

2526
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:46,210
And here's why.

2527
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:47,980
Popping pain pills like tic tacs.

2528
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:52,720
I mean if that surgery existed and it was,

2529
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:57,870
I could take the pill and or or whatever
and then just be five foot six the next

2530
01:07:58,450 --> 01:07:59,283
day and not,

2531
01:07:59,290 --> 01:08:01,150
cause now the guys that have
that limb lengthening surgery,

2532
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:05,440
they look like you've had limb
lengthening surgery where yeah,

2533
01:08:05,441 --> 01:08:06,274
you have like,

2534
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:06,971
yeah,

2535
01:08:06,971 --> 01:08:08,710
your mechanics are all wrong.

2536
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:08,981
Right.

2537
01:08:08,981 --> 01:08:11,740
Your shins are longer
than your upper thigh.

2538
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:12,730
You know,

2539
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:12,941
like,

2540
01:08:12,941 --> 01:08:15,620
so it just looks like you look at
someone like that and you just like,

2541
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:16,483
that's

2542
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:17,420
he's off for,

2543
01:08:17,421 --> 01:08:18,980
she's off in some way.

2544
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:20,330
Natural look.

2545
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:23,260
Sort of like when you
look at a person's body,

2546
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:26,020
there's a natural distance that most,

2547
01:08:26,021 --> 01:08:28,900
I mean you have people that have
some extra long arms are extra wide,

2548
01:08:28,901 --> 01:08:30,490
shoulders are extra long legs.

2549
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:33,190
But generally speaking
it looks fairly normal.

2550
01:08:33,490 --> 01:08:36,580
But then some folks they
get this surgery and you're,

2551
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:39,790
what they're doing is they're taking your
shin bone and they're stretching that

2552
01:08:39,791 --> 01:08:40,624
bitch out.

2553
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:42,550
So your Shin is like,

2554
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:42,761
you know,

2555
01:08:42,761 --> 01:08:44,200
an extra couple inches longer.

2556
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:45,140
Yeah.

2557
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:45,941
That's not fun.

2558
01:08:45,941 --> 01:08:46,400
I did that.

2559
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,440
Do anything with time too.

2560
01:08:47,441 --> 01:08:47,711
Right.

2561
01:08:47,711 --> 01:08:50,530
Did they do anything with like the
snail Dick and the spikes and stuff like

2562
01:08:50,531 --> 01:08:50,710
that?

2563
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:51,610
You guys have to wait.

2564
01:08:51,611 --> 01:08:52,650
Snail Dick and spikes.

2565
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:53,950
So what are you talking about?

2566
01:08:53,951 --> 01:08:55,720
What the Flash Oh,

2567
01:08:55,721 --> 01:08:55,910
it was,

2568
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:58,140
I mean it's just like a,

2569
01:08:58,141 --> 01:09:01,390
a stereotype about dwarves that
that doesn't necessarily exist.

2570
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:01,960
Uh,

2571
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,130
do you have any one side stick?

2572
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:10,250
I was saying that I what the fuck
in the old days with spikes spikes

2573
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:14,830
my cock is like a medieval weapon.

2574
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:16,480
Why would you say that?

2575
01:09:16,481 --> 01:09:17,350
Like it's normal.

2576
01:09:17,410 --> 01:09:18,040
And what does it,

2577
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,270
does that make sense to you?

2578
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:20,340
Oh yeah.

2579
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:21,400
Snail Dick would spikes.

2580
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,680
You don't even qualify and it's so lazy

2581
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:26,040
but uh,

2582
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:26,680
to uh,

2583
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:27,190
to add it,

2584
01:09:27,190 --> 01:09:28,030
to answer your question,

2585
01:09:28,031 --> 01:09:28,331
yeah,

2586
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:29,350
I would probably do that.

2587
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:33,700
I I'd probably cause there's health things
that I'm going to go through that I'm

2588
01:09:33,701 --> 01:09:37,150
already going through that
you're advertising people
don't have to go through.

2589
01:09:37,150 --> 01:09:38,300
Like what kind of things you're going to?

2590
01:09:38,830 --> 01:09:39,663
Uh,

2591
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:44,410
I've had a surgery on my legs because
my legs were bowed and so I had to have

2592
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:48,370
surgery on him to like straighten them
up cause they were unhealthily boat.

2593
01:09:48,371 --> 01:09:51,730
Like I looked like I was a
fucking croquet wicket and then,

2594
01:09:51,731 --> 01:09:52,500
uh,

2595
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:53,200
um,

2596
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,760
I have back problems now.

2597
01:09:54,761 --> 01:09:55,091
Like right.

2598
01:09:55,091 --> 01:09:56,560
Everyone has back problems it seems like,

2599
01:09:56,561 --> 01:09:58,150
but I've like,

2600
01:09:58,151 --> 01:09:58,961
cause my spine,

2601
01:09:58,961 --> 01:10:00,400
I've got not scoliosis,

2602
01:10:00,401 --> 01:10:01,810
but what is it called?

2603
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:05,950
Like a gnosis where it's
curved on the very bottom.

2604
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:06,290
Oh,

2605
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:06,730
no,

2606
01:10:06,730 --> 01:10:07,870
stenosis is a short,

2607
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,060
like a shortening of the nerve canal.

2608
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:11,470
It's probably something different.

2609
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:14,440
I've got something where my
spine curves at the bottom.

2610
01:10:14,441 --> 01:10:16,840
There's a lot of little people
that have breathing problems.

2611
01:10:16,841 --> 01:10:18,520
I'm thankfully not one of those.

2612
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:19,241
Uh,

2613
01:10:19,241 --> 01:10:19,650
but yeah,

2614
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:19,860
there's,

2615
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:22,600
there's a lot of dwarfs that of
have back surgeries like crazy,

2616
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:27,610
like neck surgeries cause and also these
next are holding up these ginormous

2617
01:10:27,611 --> 01:10:28,510
heads that we have.

2618
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,420
I would imagine there's
a mechanical difference.

2619
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,780
When you had the surgery for your legs,

2620
01:10:34,781 --> 01:10:36,370
like what do they do a,

2621
01:10:36,371 --> 01:10:36,671
they,

2622
01:10:36,671 --> 01:10:37,391
it's called,

2623
01:10:37,391 --> 01:10:40,060
I had what's called a dome
osteotomy where they just,

2624
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:45,120
they carve like a dome shape into my
bone and then they just move the bone.

2625
01:10:45,161 --> 01:10:46,150
Like they just kind of,

2626
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:47,523
you know,

2627
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:48,910
and they just straighten it up.

2628
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:51,130
And I had to be in a wheelchair
for about like eight months.

2629
01:10:51,490 --> 01:10:52,323
But uh,

2630
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:53,770
when did you have that done?

2631
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:54,760
Junior high.

2632
01:10:54,761 --> 01:10:56,870
So right when you're trying to get cool,

2633
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:58,720
he's in a wheelchair.

2634
01:10:59,000 --> 01:10:59,860
It was awesome.

2635
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:01,900
That's fucking crazy.

2636
01:11:01,901 --> 01:11:02,190
Yeah.

2637
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:02,530
And,

2638
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:03,860
and I've been lucky like,

2639
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:07,900
like the fact that I've
only had essentially one
major dwarf related surgery,

2640
01:11:07,901 --> 01:11:10,660
that's pretty rare for a
31 year old little person.

2641
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:13,560
Like there's a lot of us that
have more surgeries that,

2642
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:14,580
so

2643
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:15,570
in that way,

2644
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:15,871
yeah,

2645
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:18,240
I would absolutely do
the magical surgery that,

2646
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:18,960
uh,

2647
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:19,950
may doesn't exist,

2648
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:21,330
doesn't exist.

2649
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:21,631
Jimmy.

2650
01:11:21,631 --> 01:11:22,560
See if you can find that,

2651
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:25,880
that piece that they did
on people in China that,

2652
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:30,850
that got that leg limb lengthening
surgery cause it was really disturbing.

2653
01:11:30,851 --> 01:11:31,381
This poor guy,

2654
01:11:31,381 --> 01:11:32,214
they wanted to be,

2655
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:33,630
he wanted his face blurred out,

2656
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:36,450
but he was just talking about how
he's hoping that he could get a woman,

2657
01:11:36,451 --> 01:11:36,661
you know,

2658
01:11:36,661 --> 01:11:39,000
that some day a woman would
talk to them and dude,

2659
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:40,860
I'm four foot four,

2660
01:11:40,861 --> 01:11:41,520
I get laid,

2661
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:42,353
it's fine,

2662
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:43,710
but you're a comic.

2663
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:44,880
That's the difference,

2664
01:11:44,881 --> 01:11:45,271
man.

2665
01:11:45,271 --> 01:11:45,980
You're funny.

2666
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:48,270
It does help a lot,

2667
01:11:48,271 --> 01:11:48,870
dude.

2668
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:51,660
We've all seen some pretty ugly
comics that have hot checks.

2669
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:52,411
Absolutely.

2670
01:11:52,411 --> 01:11:53,820
Like what the fuck is this?

2671
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:54,720
Why is everyone looking at me?

2672
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:56,270
Yeah.

2673
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:56,520
Ugly.

2674
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:57,490
You're just a slob.

2675
01:11:58,330 --> 01:12:00,080
That's the God's thank goddess.

2676
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:00,943
It.

2677
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:01,933
Uh,

2678
01:12:02,410 --> 01:12:03,080
yeah.

2679
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:03,871
So this is it,

2680
01:12:03,871 --> 01:12:04,171
man.

2681
01:12:04,171 --> 01:12:04,441
Yeah.

2682
01:12:04,441 --> 01:12:07,080
This is the piece could crank
this up from that Geo way.

2683
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,040
It might get us.

2684
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:10,080
Have you play it like the volume?

2685
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:11,101
Yeah,

2686
01:12:11,101 --> 01:12:12,990
just play the volume of
it so we can listen to it.

2687
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:17,060
Height has become a critical
condition for success.

2688
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:17,953
Oh Wow.

2689
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:19,460
Lack the proper tallness.

2690
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:20,820
You may be denied jobs.

2691
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:24,620
Thomas is a word or
even college admission.

2692
01:12:24,650 --> 01:12:29,090
Fucking sizes left out as
a dating tallness isn't it?

2693
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:30,710
Height one is to have their billing.

2694
01:12:30,711 --> 01:12:31,910
Scratch will be in Horn,

2695
01:12:31,911 --> 01:12:33,050
lengthy trial.

2696
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:35,330
That can carry some serious risks.

2697
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:35,660
Oh,

2698
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:36,110
there it is.

2699
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:37,370
Girls getting it done.

2700
01:12:37,410 --> 01:12:38,020
Weekend.

2701
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,120
We're in depth and
they're not even towards

2702
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:44,210
who Dan is given a local anesthetic,

2703
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:47,300
which means he will be
awake for the two hour long.

2704
01:12:47,301 --> 01:12:47,870
Perception.

2705
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:48,703
Fuck me.

2706
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,710
No holes are drilled into.

2707
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:52,820
That's a trail race.

2708
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:54,050
Is this food in place?

2709
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:58,640
They look medievals but they are
the key to stabilizing the leg.

2710
01:12:58,670 --> 01:12:59,310
No one.

2711
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:00,143
Goodness.

2712
01:13:00,410 --> 01:13:01,243
Nope,

2713
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:03,653
no.

2714
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:06,890
He's doing it with a wire saw.

2715
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,910
Janet could be damage to the mirror.

2716
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:13,400
Brian surrounded by this.

2717
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:14,840
This is insane.

2718
01:13:14,930 --> 01:13:16,820
They're hammering into this guy shin.

2719
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:17,300
Well,

2720
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:19,700
this guy's a week will grow into the gap.

2721
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:22,340
Harnessing the healing power.

2722
01:13:22,341 --> 01:13:24,200
This is definitely something
you're going to look back and go,

2723
01:13:24,201 --> 01:13:26,870
that's medieval 20 years from now,

2724
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:29,900
God and hear what he says here.

2725
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:33,140
I don't think it's more gratifying
for patients and doctors.

2726
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:35,000
The the day the braces come off

2727
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:39,230
after a process that
has taken one long year,

2728
01:13:39,530 --> 01:13:41,300
that day has finally come.

2729
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:42,183
Whoa.

2730
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:45,920
Operation in reverse.

2731
01:13:46,670 --> 01:13:50,590
First the struts are removed
out of their legs are here,

2732
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:52,720
taking them face.

2733
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:55,750
Now the patient can walk away by herself.

2734
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:58,340
Now I feel more natural,

2735
01:13:58,470 --> 01:13:59,303
more normal,

2736
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:01,070
and I feel much happier.

2737
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:01,953
Oh God,

2738
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:03,531
I don't see that.

2739
01:14:03,531 --> 01:14:05,840
I see are in how many cars ranges later.

2740
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:08,360
Four inches to be joined society.

2741
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:08,760
Wow.

2742
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:10,490
Color and more confident.

2743
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:11,710
First off,

2744
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:12,400
the oranges

2745
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,590
and your chin or your shade chooses,

2746
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:15,483
that's it.

2747
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:16,713
Not a foot.

2748
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:17,913
His homeboy.

2749
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:19,331
Yeah,

2750
01:14:19,331 --> 01:14:19,810
that's it.

2751
01:14:19,810 --> 01:14:21,490
Now when they say four inches,

2752
01:14:21,491 --> 01:14:23,890
it's all four inches in your shins.

2753
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:26,740
Like imagine if your Shin grew that much.

2754
01:14:27,650 --> 01:14:28,120
I can't.

2755
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:28,360
I mean,

2756
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:32,830
that can't be like your Shin can't
maintain the same amount of strength and

2757
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,520
like,

2758
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:33,701
well,

2759
01:14:33,701 --> 01:14:34,534
it definitely can.

2760
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:34,871
I mean,

2761
01:14:34,871 --> 01:14:35,820
it's going to be exhausting.

2762
01:14:35,850 --> 01:14:36,161
Yeah,

2763
01:14:36,161 --> 01:14:37,060
it's all bone.

2764
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,590
I don't think that's the issue.

2765
01:14:38,591 --> 01:14:41,060
I think the issue is like
the mechanics of your body,

2766
01:14:41,061 --> 01:14:41,920
you're going to be different.

2767
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:44,560
Especially if you do any kind of sport.

2768
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,960
It's like you're standing
on island stilts,

2769
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:48,060
you know,

2770
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:49,450
just just a little extra there.

2771
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:49,631
Yeah.

2772
01:14:49,631 --> 01:14:51,580
Why don't you just get four
inches put on your shoe?

2773
01:14:51,710 --> 01:14:54,350
You know that he wants
to be naked and taller.

2774
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:54,650
Yeah,

2775
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:54,930
yeah,

2776
01:14:54,930 --> 01:14:55,763
yeah.

2777
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:58,750
But like that's the part
that like that whole process,

2778
01:14:58,751 --> 01:15:02,110
we saw a two minute clip
that's a year at least.

2779
01:15:02,111 --> 01:15:07,060
Or like between eight to 12 like eight
to 14 months of doing that for four

2780
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,710
freaking inches.

2781
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,740
Well maybe she could do it or
upper leg and get eight inches,

2782
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:16,950
maybe a freaky ass legs and then do
it on your back stretch or fuck him.

2783
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,320
Imagine eating.

2784
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,570
You don't see your friend
for like a couple of years.

2785
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:25,180
Then all sudden they're six
to like two used to be five,

2786
01:15:25,181 --> 01:15:25,541
five.

2787
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:26,770
What the fuck happened?

2788
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:27,281
Surgery.

2789
01:15:27,281 --> 01:15:28,114
Mood.

2790
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:29,920
I've been doing a lot of shit like,

2791
01:15:29,921 --> 01:15:30,754
and,

2792
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:35,140
and that's the thing that trips me out
too is like these are advertised people.

2793
01:15:35,141 --> 01:15:36,190
They're just like five,

2794
01:15:36,191 --> 01:15:36,611
three,

2795
01:15:36,611 --> 01:15:38,080
or whatever that are getting the surgery.

2796
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,430
When dwarves do it,

2797
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:42,130
we still have the disproportionate body,

2798
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:43,540
so you can still tell.

2799
01:15:43,541 --> 01:15:43,840
It's like,

2800
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:44,110
oh,

2801
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:47,890
that like you don't suddenly become
like a normal looking person.

2802
01:15:47,891 --> 01:15:49,120
Like you look like a dwarf.

2803
01:15:49,121 --> 01:15:51,730
It was stretched out in
a fucking taffy machine.

2804
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:56,170
Like it's not like everything
now fits and looks as it should.

2805
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:56,441
Well,

2806
01:15:56,441 --> 01:15:58,180
for someone who was a dwarf,

2807
01:15:58,181 --> 01:16:01,300
they would literally have to
stretch out almost all of your body.

2808
01:16:01,330 --> 01:16:01,980
Right.

2809
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:05,230
It would have to be a thing where
you're in constant agony arms.

2810
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:06,700
Oh my God,

2811
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:08,950
they've done it on this woman.

2812
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,353
Okay.

2813
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:11,320
She's got,

2814
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,790
she's got Achondroplasia uh,

2815
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:15,070
on on the left.

2816
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,120
But then like,

2817
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:18,250
look at how the thighs on the right,

2818
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:22,180
like when she's had the limb lengthening
your ass and thighs are still those

2819
01:16:22,181 --> 01:16:23,590
dwarf acid and thighs,

2820
01:16:23,591 --> 01:16:25,210
which are fucking huge.

2821
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:26,501
They're massive.

2822
01:16:26,501 --> 01:16:26,980
So that,

2823
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:27,813
that just,

2824
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:30,310
it looks like she has a
weird thyroid problem now.

2825
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:30,440
Well,

2826
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:30,970
it's also,

2827
01:16:30,970 --> 01:16:31,361
she's,

2828
01:16:31,361 --> 01:16:31,991
Oh yeah,

2829
01:16:31,991 --> 01:16:33,760
she's only lengthen to her shins,

2830
01:16:33,761 --> 01:16:34,150
right?

2831
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:35,140
Is that what happened there?

2832
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:36,153
I think so.

2833
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:38,320
It looks like her upper
legs and longer as well.

2834
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:42,130
[inaudible] limb length and knee
surgery creates controversy.

2835
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:43,563
Gee,

2836
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,201
thanks man.

2837
01:16:44,201 --> 01:16:45,820
Creates fucking controversy.

2838
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:47,711
Okay,

2839
01:16:47,711 --> 01:16:48,460
here it goes.

2840
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:49,061
Three foot,

2841
01:16:49,061 --> 01:16:50,080
10 inches tall.

2842
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,480
Cruise associated with any challenges,

2843
01:16:52,481 --> 01:16:52,661
blah,

2844
01:16:52,661 --> 01:16:52,870
blah.

2845
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:54,790
I was having hip problems,

2846
01:16:54,791 --> 01:16:55,361
knee problems,

2847
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:57,640
back problems because of how
bode my legs where that's true.

2848
01:16:57,641 --> 01:16:58,540
That's what you had to deal with.

2849
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:01,990
This is accomplished with a series of
three controversial bone lengthening

2850
01:17:01,991 --> 01:17:05,020
procedures using technology developed
in southern California with such

2851
01:17:05,021 --> 01:17:05,531
procedures.

2852
01:17:05,531 --> 01:17:06,011
Patients,

2853
01:17:06,011 --> 01:17:08,950
bones in the arms and legs are surgically.

2854
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:10,430
Then increased,

2855
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:12,680
increasingly separated
over a period of months.

2856
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:14,290
The body generates new bone,

2857
01:17:14,310 --> 01:17:14,960
fill the gap,

2858
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,270
thus making the bones longer.

2859
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:17,190
Wow.

2860
01:17:17,450 --> 01:17:21,410
Does does it say what
her 13 inches taller.

2861
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:22,220
Wow.

2862
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:23,130
Oh my God.

2863
01:17:23,131 --> 01:17:25,800
It's pretty hundred
thousand dollars four years.

2864
01:17:25,830 --> 01:17:26,400
Whoa.

2865
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:27,450
Four years to do it.

2866
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:27,901
Wow.

2867
01:17:27,901 --> 01:17:30,120
She became 13 inches tall.

2868
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:31,170
That's incredible.

2869
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:32,010
Ah,

2870
01:17:32,010 --> 01:17:34,300
for me that that would go
to four from four foot,

2871
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:35,780
four to five.

2872
01:17:36,030 --> 01:17:37,530
Did you be like almost my height?

2873
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:37,850
Yeah.

2874
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:38,450
It'd be sad.

2875
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:39,283
Just shorter than me.

2876
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:40,413
That's crazy.

2877
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:41,310
Do it,

2878
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:43,600
but you do it.

2879
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:47,260
I think if I was a small person
I would just stay smiling.

2880
01:17:47,490 --> 01:17:48,271
I think it's great.

2881
01:17:48,271 --> 01:17:49,710
I don't have any problem with that.

2882
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:53,970
If your Dick's the same
size and everything that'd
be out and embrace being a

2883
01:17:53,971 --> 01:17:54,804
small person.

2884
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,520
I mean I like,

2885
01:17:56,580 --> 01:18:00,690
I understand the things that drive
these people to do it because,

2886
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:03,030
and like for me,

2887
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,340
no matter what I do in this business,

2888
01:18:05,490 --> 01:18:10,020
if I become a a famous actor
doing movies or whatever,

2889
01:18:10,021 --> 01:18:10,920
standup specials,

2890
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:11,783
whatever,

2891
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:15,810
I'm still gonna walk down the street and
kids are still going to see me and go,

2892
01:18:15,811 --> 01:18:16,201
mommy,

2893
01:18:16,201 --> 01:18:17,490
what's that mommy?

2894
01:18:17,491 --> 01:18:18,360
What's wrong with him?

2895
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:18,841
What?

2896
01:18:18,841 --> 01:18:19,321
Like what?

2897
01:18:19,321 --> 01:18:19,950
Stop.

2898
01:18:19,950 --> 01:18:21,420
And so that never,

2899
01:18:21,421 --> 01:18:23,730
that never stops Veeresh wharf ever.

2900
01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:25,110
And so I,

2901
01:18:25,390 --> 01:18:28,020
I kind of get what drives people to do it.

2902
01:18:28,021 --> 01:18:30,900
They're just so depressed and so like,

2903
01:18:30,930 --> 01:18:33,540
cause they think that's going to stop
and now their lives are just going to be

2904
01:18:33,541 --> 01:18:34,410
perfect but

2905
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:37,760
he's going to have that.

2906
01:18:37,761 --> 01:18:40,460
I mean there's people that are
beautiful that fuck with their face.

2907
01:18:40,461 --> 01:18:40,801
I mean,

2908
01:18:40,801 --> 01:18:41,060
yeah,

2909
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:42,140
we don't have to name names,

2910
01:18:42,141 --> 01:18:46,940
but we know like beautiful women that
have gotten their lip shot up with things

2911
01:18:46,941 --> 01:18:50,480
and fuck their faces up
and people are crazy man.

2912
01:18:50,481 --> 01:18:50,711
And,

2913
01:18:50,711 --> 01:18:53,000
and if you start fixating on anything,

2914
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:56,300
you start fixating on my
shoulder should be like this.

2915
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:58,230
I wish my shoulders were like this.

2916
01:18:58,910 --> 01:19:00,030
They need to go upper.

2917
01:19:00,031 --> 01:19:00,351
And you're like,

2918
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:00,920
people aren't,

2919
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:01,790
there was a video,

2920
01:19:01,791 --> 01:19:02,060
um,

2921
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:05,150
that I was watching the other day about
this guy in Brazil that almost had to

2922
01:19:05,151 --> 01:19:06,140
have his arms removed,

2923
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:09,590
has been circulating cause he
does this thing called Synthol.

2924
01:19:09,591 --> 01:19:10,790
Do you know what Synthol is?

2925
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:12,060
It's um,

2926
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:16,430
body builders use it to pretend that
they have bigger muscles than they are.

2927
01:19:16,431 --> 01:19:21,020
So what they do is they inject their body
with this oil and this oil makes their

2928
01:19:21,021 --> 01:19:23,480
muscles bulge out and this really weird,

2929
01:19:23,481 --> 01:19:24,530
unnatural way.

2930
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,150
And it looks like they got like,

2931
01:19:26,570 --> 01:19:27,403
like,

2932
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:28,760
like an infection.

2933
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:29,953
It swells,

2934
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:31,640
but bit by spiders.

2935
01:19:31,641 --> 01:19:32,251
This guy like that.

2936
01:19:32,251 --> 01:19:33,730
That's fuck Steven.

2937
01:19:33,850 --> 01:19:34,683
Yeah.

2938
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:39,470
It's like he has two
turtles in his shoulders.

2939
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:40,431
Yeah.

2940
01:19:40,431 --> 01:19:42,170
And not only the turtles,

2941
01:19:42,171 --> 01:19:45,380
like not only does he
look weird and crazy,

2942
01:19:45,381 --> 01:19:47,480
but it's totally out of proportion.

2943
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,033
Like you look at his,

2944
01:19:49,130 --> 01:19:51,950
his waist and his whole thing is like,

2945
01:19:51,951 --> 01:19:53,210
what the fuck is that?

2946
01:19:53,211 --> 01:19:54,290
It's like you're sick.

2947
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:55,220
It looks goofy.

2948
01:19:55,221 --> 01:19:56,750
Why would he think that even looks good?

2949
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:56,901
Well,

2950
01:19:56,901 --> 01:20:00,710
why do you think women that have giant
breast implants think that those things

2951
01:20:00,711 --> 01:20:01,730
like that got like,

2952
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:01,901
ah,

2953
01:20:01,901 --> 01:20:04,370
I've got double D's but then
I think I could go bigger.

2954
01:20:04,410 --> 01:20:04,760
Your lives.

2955
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:06,260
A lot of women like that man.

2956
01:20:06,261 --> 01:20:07,094
It's like just like,

2957
01:20:07,930 --> 01:20:08,130
just

2958
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:09,930
like certain bodybuilders.

2959
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,320
People have body dysmorphia where they,

2960
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:14,670
they look at their body
and it becomes an issue.

2961
01:20:14,671 --> 01:20:18,680
They just can't stop fucking with their
body and can't stop fucking with their,

2962
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:19,831
their nose.

2963
01:20:19,831 --> 01:20:20,820
Like I know,

2964
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,890
I know girl was ruined or nose man.

2965
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:24,570
She had a beautiful nose.

2966
01:20:24,571 --> 01:20:26,070
It was just kind of a little big,

2967
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:27,000
but she was pretty,

2968
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:27,410
you know,

2969
01:20:27,410 --> 01:20:28,380
there's nothing wrong with it.

2970
01:20:28,381 --> 01:20:33,360
And then I saw her with ego and they don't
see the pretty face and they got like

2971
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:34,410
a ski slope.

2972
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:37,440
There was something missing
from the middle of her nose.

2973
01:20:37,441 --> 01:20:38,850
It's like fog.

2974
01:20:38,851 --> 01:20:40,120
We don't do the,

2975
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:43,260
oh so crazy.

2976
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:45,600
I like,

2977
01:20:45,601 --> 01:20:46,020
um,

2978
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:47,930
I feel sorry for the
people that go through it.

2979
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:53,600
Like I can't imagine just nitpicking so
much that well you probably have a level

2980
01:20:53,791 --> 01:20:54,120
of,

2981
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:59,100
of body acceptance that other people
don't let me know what I'm saying.

2982
01:20:59,100 --> 01:20:59,760
Like you have,

2983
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:03,300
there's a certain amount that you just
have to deal with that other people don't

2984
01:21:03,301 --> 01:21:04,134
have to deal with.

2985
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:07,110
So when you hear people
complaining about like Stupid Shit,

2986
01:21:07,550 --> 01:21:08,940
oh my ears are too little.

2987
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:10,070
Like shut the fuck.

2988
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:10,900
Yeah.

2989
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:11,820
My calves.

2990
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:12,130
Uh,

2991
01:21:12,130 --> 01:21:12,390
Mike,

2992
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:12,680
Mike,

2993
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:12,850
Mike,

2994
01:21:12,850 --> 01:21:14,130
Mike Calves aren't big enough.

2995
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:14,430
Yeah,

2996
01:21:14,430 --> 01:21:15,690
look around four feet tall.

2997
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:17,491
Really?

2998
01:21:17,491 --> 01:21:18,324
You're tell me.

2999
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:18,780
Yeah.

3000
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:19,250
It's like,

3001
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:19,560
uh,

3002
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,660
sometimes people come up
to me after shows and,

3003
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:22,000
and,

3004
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:22,561
and they're like,

3005
01:21:22,561 --> 01:21:22,801
wow,

3006
01:21:22,801 --> 01:21:23,634
Brad,

3007
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:24,960
what you said on stage,

3008
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:28,200
I really was touched and moved by it.

3009
01:21:28,201 --> 01:21:28,531
Cause you know,

3010
01:21:28,531 --> 01:21:31,020
I go through a lot of that because
I'm five foot four and I'm,

3011
01:21:31,021 --> 01:21:36,021
and I'm a guy and I'm like Julia lives
what I would do to be five foot four,

3012
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:40,320
what horrible things I would
do behind a dumpster to be,

3013
01:21:42,090 --> 01:21:42,990
and you're out there like,

3014
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:43,591
oh man,

3015
01:21:43,591 --> 01:21:43,851
I,

3016
01:21:43,851 --> 01:21:44,340
I like,

3017
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:46,080
like I'm starting to accept myself.

3018
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,850
It's five foot four because of you.

3019
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:52,910
Do you pay attention to all of the
scientific research that's being done and

3020
01:21:53,431 --> 01:21:55,440
genetic engineering and changing?

3021
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:56,760
Is there anything that's on,

3022
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:57,151
yeah,

3023
01:21:57,151 --> 01:21:57,840
like um,

3024
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,900
they actually identified the Dwarf Jean.

3025
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:05,960
Like they've been able to identify the
gene that causes dwarfism and this debate

3026
01:22:06,901 --> 01:22:08,310
has gone on as their,

3027
01:22:08,311 --> 01:22:11,190
as the technology keeps getting closer
to the point where we can actually do

3028
01:22:11,191 --> 01:22:11,880
this.

3029
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:15,460
But there's debate going is
if we can remove that gene,

3030
01:22:16,110 --> 01:22:19,170
if we can prevent your
child from having tourism,

3031
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:20,303
should we,

3032
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:21,750
and a lot of dwarves were like,

3033
01:22:21,751 --> 01:22:21,931
no,

3034
01:22:21,931 --> 01:22:22,591
we shouldn't do it.

3035
01:22:22,591 --> 01:22:23,371
It's playing God.

3036
01:22:23,371 --> 01:22:24,180
It's stumped.

3037
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:24,690
And I'm,

3038
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:25,800
I'm there going,

3039
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:26,580
yeah,

3040
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:27,720
you should absolutely remove it.

3041
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:29,071
Absolutely.

3042
01:22:29,071 --> 01:22:32,250
Why would you want your kid to go through?

3043
01:22:32,370 --> 01:22:32,581
I mean,

3044
01:22:32,581 --> 01:22:33,060
granted,

3045
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:34,140
I've been lucky at like,

3046
01:22:34,141 --> 01:22:34,681
like I said,

3047
01:22:34,681 --> 01:22:39,681
I've only had like one surgery and I made
a good career with the hand that I was

3048
01:22:40,651 --> 01:22:41,370
dealt.

3049
01:22:41,370 --> 01:22:43,470
But there's a lot of
little people I know that,

3050
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:44,640
that haven't,

3051
01:22:44,641 --> 01:22:45,470
that don't,

3052
01:22:45,470 --> 01:22:49,560
and then he constantly made fun of their
entire lives are hidden away by their

3053
01:22:49,561 --> 01:22:49,951
parents.

3054
01:22:49,951 --> 01:22:54,300
Why would you want your kid to
go through that and as a dwarf,

3055
01:22:54,301 --> 01:22:54,631
you know,

3056
01:22:54,631 --> 01:22:56,340
what struggles that you had growing up,

3057
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:57,300
why would you,

3058
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:01,290
why would you intentionally
put those pains on your child?

3059
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:02,520
I don't understand that.

3060
01:23:02,910 --> 01:23:03,450
I don't,

3061
01:23:03,450 --> 01:23:05,800
it's hard to understand a lot
of decisions that people make.

3062
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:09,490
A lot of rationalizations
that people may like.

3063
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:12,910
One reason that I'm able to be a comedian
and sort of have this sense of humor

3064
01:23:12,911 --> 01:23:13,211
about it,

3065
01:23:13,211 --> 01:23:16,390
it's because my dad was amazing,

3066
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:17,020
is amazing.

3067
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:17,770
Uh,

3068
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:19,030
like when I was born,

3069
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:20,830
he found out that I was
going to be a dwarf.

3070
01:23:20,831 --> 01:23:23,500
So he would go to these,

3071
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:23,890
uh,

3072
01:23:23,890 --> 01:23:24,790
LPA,

3073
01:23:24,850 --> 01:23:29,260
little people of America meetings and
he would find out about it and he was

3074
01:23:29,261 --> 01:23:29,440
like,

3075
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:29,861
Oh shit,

3076
01:23:29,861 --> 01:23:31,240
my kid's going to get made fun.

3077
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:33,130
Of a lot like his life
is going to be weird.

3078
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:36,070
So his philosophy was
when I was growing up,

3079
01:23:36,071 --> 01:23:37,630
he would make fun of me first,

3080
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:40,000
but he would do it in a supportive way.

3081
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:41,470
Like he would fuck with me but didn't say,

3082
01:23:41,471 --> 01:23:41,771
okay,

3083
01:23:41,771 --> 01:23:42,551
I just insulted you,

3084
01:23:42,551 --> 01:23:43,510
hit me back with something,

3085
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:45,020
hit me back and then get,

3086
01:23:45,090 --> 01:23:46,780
because this is going
to happen to you later.

3087
01:23:47,850 --> 01:23:48,031
Bye.

3088
01:23:48,031 --> 01:23:49,030
It's like training you.

3089
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:49,611
Yeah.

3090
01:23:49,611 --> 01:23:52,090
So by the time I got
to kindergarten I like,

3091
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:56,910
I remember kindergarten walking in
in a a kid just laughing at me going,

3092
01:23:56,911 --> 01:23:58,120
ha ha you're little.

3093
01:23:58,121 --> 01:23:58,850
And I looked at him and went,

3094
01:23:58,850 --> 01:23:59,111
ha ha,

3095
01:23:59,111 --> 01:24:02,770
your mom doesn't live with your
dad anymore and kindergarten,

3096
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:06,280
kindergarten and fucking like I got
sent to the principal's office for like,

3097
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:08,110
like hurting this kid's feelings.

3098
01:24:08,230 --> 01:24:09,130
That's hilarious.

3099
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:09,610
Yeah.

3100
01:24:09,610 --> 01:24:10,280
And like,

3101
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:11,450
and they called my dad,

3102
01:24:11,451 --> 01:24:11,621
they're like,

3103
01:24:11,621 --> 01:24:12,670
we're going to call your father.

3104
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:13,030
I'm like,

3105
01:24:13,030 --> 01:24:13,870
fucking do it.

3106
01:24:14,110 --> 01:24:15,640
He turned you to be a comedian.

3107
01:24:15,641 --> 01:24:16,474
Kind of.

3108
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,220
Cause now like when I get a heckler,

3109
01:24:18,221 --> 01:24:18,461
it's like,

3110
01:24:18,461 --> 01:24:22,180
do you think you're going to say anything
to me that I haven't heard on the

3111
01:24:22,181 --> 01:24:25,080
street that I haven't heard
walking down and some kid haven't.

3112
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,820
We like saying a comment like I've had,

3113
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:33,420
I've had parents bring their children up
to me when the line is too long at the

3114
01:24:34,451 --> 01:24:35,650
mall Santa and go,

3115
01:24:35,651 --> 01:24:35,921
hey,

3116
01:24:35,921 --> 01:24:36,930
tell this guy what,

3117
01:24:36,931 --> 01:24:39,730
what you want or you
had that happen to me.

3118
01:24:39,930 --> 01:24:41,010
They came up,

3119
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:41,381
they said,

3120
01:24:41,381 --> 01:24:43,930
tell this guy what you want
were just a regular guy.

3121
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:44,530
Yes.

3122
01:24:44,530 --> 01:24:45,071
Cause they're like,

3123
01:24:45,071 --> 01:24:45,520
well he,

3124
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:48,640
well he knows Santa so you could
talk to him and then he'll fuck.

3125
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:50,170
Then he'll give the message to Santa.

3126
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:51,353
He said them.

3127
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:52,383
Um,

3128
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:53,651
uh,

3129
01:24:53,651 --> 01:24:55,630
I tell this story in my special,

3130
01:24:55,631 --> 01:24:55,781
which,

3131
01:24:55,781 --> 01:24:55,931
hey,

3132
01:24:55,931 --> 01:24:56,680
I'll plug it now.

3133
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:57,430
Um,

3134
01:24:57,430 --> 01:24:57,761
my,

3135
01:24:57,761 --> 01:24:58,210
uh,

3136
01:24:58,210 --> 01:25:01,820
one hour comedy special Brad Williams
Fund size comes down and showtime May 8th,

3137
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:06,130
so watch it recorded and showtimes going
to replay the shit out of it so you'll

3138
01:25:06,131 --> 01:25:07,840
have plenty of chances to see it anyway.

3139
01:25:08,230 --> 01:25:08,531
Uh,

3140
01:25:08,531 --> 01:25:09,610
but what happened was,

3141
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:12,430
is this guy came up and
with his kid and was like,

3142
01:25:12,431 --> 01:25:14,600
you see you saw and he's
working undercover for Santa.

3143
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:15,390
He's going to,

3144
01:25:15,390 --> 01:25:18,310
it's like he's out here seeing and finding
out who's naughty and nice and he's

3145
01:25:18,311 --> 01:25:19,480
going to go back and tell.

3146
01:25:19,930 --> 01:25:24,930
And like I knew in that moment where
if I get pissed off now this kid who

3147
01:25:25,691 --> 01:25:26,830
doesn't know anything about dwarfism,

3148
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:31,860
his first interaction is going to be
with someone angry and that's going to be

3149
01:25:31,931 --> 01:25:33,160
what he thinks all dwarves are.

3150
01:25:33,230 --> 01:25:34,300
That's going to be the first interaction.

3151
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,190
So I can't get pissed off.

3152
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:38,320
I can't get angry because that's,

3153
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:39,460
I'm setting the precedent.

3154
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:42,010
So what I did was I looked at Kevin went,

3155
01:25:42,011 --> 01:25:42,970
you're absolutely right.

3156
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:44,133
I am.

3157
01:25:44,230 --> 01:25:45,670
I am working undercover.

3158
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:47,110
I'm going around and seeing
who's naughty and nice,

3159
01:25:47,111 --> 01:25:47,944
but guess what?

3160
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:48,430
You've been,

3161
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:49,263
you've been really good.

3162
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:50,790
What do you want more than
anything in the world?

3163
01:25:50,791 --> 01:25:52,390
And kids like I want an x box.

3164
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:53,080
And I looked right,

3165
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:53,560
the data went,

3166
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:53,981
guess what?

3167
01:25:53,981 --> 01:25:57,190
You're getting an x box and
the dad and the dad's like,

3168
01:25:57,191 --> 01:25:57,851
I don't know about this.

3169
01:25:57,851 --> 01:25:58,091
And like,

3170
01:25:58,091 --> 01:25:58,990
what else do you want?

3171
01:25:58,991 --> 01:26:00,870
And the good that's like waving like no,

3172
01:26:00,871 --> 01:26:00,941
no,

3173
01:26:00,941 --> 01:26:01,021
no,

3174
01:26:01,021 --> 01:26:01,121
no,

3175
01:26:01,121 --> 01:26:01,241
no.

3176
01:26:01,241 --> 01:26:01,630
He's like,

3177
01:26:01,630 --> 01:26:01,871
he's like,

3178
01:26:01,871 --> 01:26:02,950
I really want to bike.

3179
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:03,231
I'm like,

3180
01:26:03,231 --> 01:26:04,590
you're getting a bike though.

3181
01:26:04,591 --> 01:26:06,290
Look at getting one.

3182
01:26:06,610 --> 01:26:07,341
And I told the kid,

3183
01:26:07,341 --> 01:26:07,581
I'm like,

3184
01:26:07,581 --> 01:26:10,100
the only way that you
don't get these things,

3185
01:26:10,101 --> 01:26:13,430
if your parents failed to
file the proper paperwork.

3186
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,930
So then he looks at data like,

3187
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:16,370
did you file the proper paperwork down?

3188
01:26:16,370 --> 01:26:16,700
And it's like,

3189
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:16,851
oh,

3190
01:26:16,851 --> 01:26:17,810
of course I did.

3191
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:18,890
You son of a bitch.

3192
01:26:18,891 --> 01:26:21,170
Like it was so and then,

3193
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:22,101
yeah.

3194
01:26:22,101 --> 01:26:24,590
Then the dad like gets
mad at me and it's like,

3195
01:26:24,591 --> 01:26:24,800
what?

3196
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,120
You brought this on yourself?

3197
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:28,700
You came to get a service somewhere?

3198
01:26:28,730 --> 01:26:31,190
No dressed in the outfit.

3199
01:26:31,191 --> 01:26:31,770
Like,

3200
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:32,190
all right,

3201
01:26:32,190 --> 01:26:36,200
if I come to the mall and I've got
pointy shoes on and pointy ears,

3202
01:26:36,290 --> 01:26:38,210
I can't get pissed when you say,

3203
01:26:38,510 --> 01:26:38,910
you know,

3204
01:26:38,910 --> 01:26:40,040
tell him what you want for Christmas.

3205
01:26:40,041 --> 01:26:40,761
I can't get mad,

3206
01:26:40,761 --> 01:26:41,571
but that's fucked up.

3207
01:26:41,571 --> 01:26:42,710
You can't even wear pointy shoes.

3208
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:46,100
You're into like those
little Alibaba Shit,

3209
01:26:47,450 --> 01:26:48,283
Mexican point,

3210
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:51,050
some cool shoes,

3211
01:26:51,051 --> 01:26:51,884
man.

3212
01:26:52,390 --> 01:26:57,140
Styles restricted because that seems
ridiculous because it was like a fucking,

3213
01:26:57,141 --> 01:26:57,860
you know,

3214
01:26:57,860 --> 01:27:00,740
Kareem Abdul Jabbar size
dude with a pointy shoes.

3215
01:27:00,741 --> 01:27:01,401
Knowing what to say.

3216
01:27:01,401 --> 01:27:01,730
Anything.

3217
01:27:01,730 --> 01:27:04,910
It's a genie is going to say
that guy works for Santa.

3218
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:05,600
Right.

3219
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:06,740
That's fucked up man.

3220
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:09,810
I can't wear racist at size.

3221
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:13,010
I can't go through life
tissues expression.

3222
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:14,743
I heard,

3223
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:15,651
fuck,

3224
01:27:15,651 --> 01:27:17,240
I forgot what show it was.

3225
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:18,590
Some TV shows said it.

3226
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:19,011
Oh,

3227
01:27:19,011 --> 01:27:19,970
I think it was the league.

3228
01:27:20,330 --> 01:27:25,330
I think the league on on Fx said
sizes and I just heard that.

3229
01:27:25,611 --> 01:27:26,600
I'm like that's pretty good.

3230
01:27:26,601 --> 01:27:27,960
I'm gonna start using that site.

3231
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:29,210
I like it.

3232
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:30,980
There's a million different interests.

3233
01:27:31,630 --> 01:27:33,200
It's getting weird.

3234
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:36,800
Well everyone has to find a
way for them to be offended.

3235
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:37,600
So yeah,

3236
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:40,670
so you have to create what a
what a what applies to you.

3237
01:27:40,671 --> 01:27:42,200
So now you can complain
like the rest of us,

3238
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:43,610
I'm hoping this is temporary.

3239
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:46,010
I'm hoping this ultra complainy society,

3240
01:27:46,011 --> 01:27:50,270
ultra whiny stage we're going through
is just a side effect of people learning

3241
01:27:50,271 --> 01:27:51,290
how to use the internet.

3242
01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:56,650
SORTA like how people didn't know
how to not get crazy on in the 90s,

3243
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:57,711
like in the,

3244
01:27:57,711 --> 01:27:58,250
in the Internet,

3245
01:27:58,250 --> 01:27:59,540
people didn't know how to,

3246
01:27:59,541 --> 01:28:00,260
you know,

3247
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:03,350
people get upset at things and
they overreact and freak out.

3248
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:06,060
They just didn't know how to
deal with people insulting them.

3249
01:28:07,450 --> 01:28:08,283
Um,

3250
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:10,220
I'm wondering if it's because,

3251
01:28:10,221 --> 01:28:13,130
have we gotten to a point where like,

3252
01:28:13,430 --> 01:28:15,920
cause I doubt that uh,

3253
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:19,540
in third world countries they're
having a debate of should,

3254
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:21,110
should we say bossy?

3255
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:25,520
Like do you think those people
who are trying to get food,

3256
01:28:25,521 --> 01:28:26,660
who don't have clean water,

3257
01:28:26,661 --> 01:28:27,411
who don't have good,

3258
01:28:27,411 --> 01:28:29,120
who don't have vaccinations are like,

3259
01:28:29,121 --> 01:28:29,750
okay,

3260
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:31,040
I know all this shit's going on,

3261
01:28:31,041 --> 01:28:32,900
but we've got to stop
saying that we're bossy.

3262
01:28:33,170 --> 01:28:34,760
Like we've got a focus on that.

3263
01:28:34,970 --> 01:28:39,050
I think it's a lack of problems and
the human being is a dramatic animal.

3264
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:40,760
So we create this,

3265
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:44,540
we create these problems that had nowhere
just so we feel like we're struggling

3266
01:28:44,541 --> 01:28:45,200
against something.

3267
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:46,520
There's certainly a lot of that.

3268
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:50,780
Certainly a lot of people
that just have a too soft too.

3269
01:28:50,781 --> 01:28:52,780
It's too easy to get like this.

3270
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:53,120
This,

3271
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:53,330
the,

3272
01:28:53,330 --> 01:28:58,330
the ability to tweet 15 times about x
men shows me that you either have no

3273
01:28:59,391 --> 01:29:02,870
fucking friends too
much free time or your,

3274
01:29:02,871 --> 01:29:05,130
your career as being a cunt online.

3275
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:07,250
Those things here,

3276
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:10,650
you got family money or you
just don't care about money and,

3277
01:29:10,651 --> 01:29:11,570
or you know,

3278
01:29:11,730 --> 01:29:11,940
you,

3279
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:13,550
you don't have the real
problems in their lives.

3280
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:14,101
Same people.

3281
01:29:14,101 --> 01:29:14,791
20 years ago,

3282
01:29:14,791 --> 01:29:18,240
what were they picketers
and how did it didn't exist?

3283
01:29:18,241 --> 01:29:19,320
It's too hard picketing.

3284
01:29:19,321 --> 01:29:20,490
You have to actually do something.

3285
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:22,220
You have to show set up.

3286
01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:23,760
You have to love people in the eye.

3287
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:27,070
If you're standing out inside
of an abortion clinic or you're,

3288
01:29:27,071 --> 01:29:28,980
you're picketing in front of a warehouse,

3289
01:29:28,981 --> 01:29:32,490
it's nonunion and you got to
make fucking contact with people.

3290
01:29:32,491 --> 01:29:34,170
You got to get her act organize.

3291
01:29:34,171 --> 01:29:35,550
You have to be good at arts and crafts.

3292
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:37,890
So you have a sign that's
like halfway decent.

3293
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:39,690
All you have to do when you want online.

3294
01:29:39,691 --> 01:29:40,410
It's just fine.

3295
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:42,000
Other cunts and you know,

3296
01:29:42,001 --> 01:29:44,730
you gravitate through forums or you know,

3297
01:29:44,731 --> 01:29:47,250
Twitter groups and you
just can't it up together.

3298
01:29:47,850 --> 01:29:48,640
You know,

3299
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:50,030
that's what you're getting a lot.

3300
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,240
Cut it up together.

3301
01:29:51,241 --> 01:29:52,074
Joe Rogan,

3302
01:29:52,790 --> 01:29:55,710
he create this negative
ripple for no reason.

3303
01:29:55,740 --> 01:29:56,280
Really.

3304
01:29:56,280 --> 01:30:00,000
You just know you can enjoy
a movie or not enjoy a movie.

3305
01:30:00,001 --> 01:30:01,710
You can write a review about a movie,

3306
01:30:01,711 --> 01:30:03,490
but this idea that you,

3307
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:04,080
you know,

3308
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:08,190
if I go see a movie that
sucks that I did not like,

3309
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:09,700
I'll walk out of there going,

3310
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:11,430
well I didn't like that movie.

3311
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:12,121
If I could,

3312
01:30:12,121 --> 01:30:13,920
we had a restaurant that shitty.

3313
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:14,911
I'm just going to say,

3314
01:30:14,911 --> 01:30:15,151
well,

3315
01:30:15,151 --> 01:30:16,560
I'm not going back to that restaurant.

3316
01:30:16,890 --> 01:30:20,880
I'm not going to go online and start
this campaign of everyone must think like

3317
01:30:20,881 --> 01:30:21,121
me.

3318
01:30:21,121 --> 01:30:22,710
Everyone was not go to this restaurant.

3319
01:30:22,710 --> 01:30:24,300
Everyone got a Nazi this movie.

3320
01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:25,141
Fuck you.

3321
01:30:25,141 --> 01:30:26,820
If you like Paul Blart mall cop too.

3322
01:30:26,850 --> 01:30:27,300
Hey,

3323
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:28,620
if you like Paul Blart Mall Cop,

3324
01:30:28,621 --> 01:30:28,950
Dude,

3325
01:30:28,950 --> 01:30:30,030
more power to you.

3326
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:31,680
It does not affect me.

3327
01:30:31,950 --> 01:30:36,840
You enjoying that movie does not have
any repercussions on my life at all.

3328
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:38,190
So I don't care.

3329
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,020
Like whatever movie you want to watch,

3330
01:30:40,050 --> 01:30:40,311
you,

3331
01:30:40,311 --> 01:30:40,471
you,

3332
01:30:40,471 --> 01:30:40,630
you,

3333
01:30:40,630 --> 01:30:40,791
you,

3334
01:30:40,791 --> 01:30:40,891
you,

3335
01:30:40,891 --> 01:30:43,260
you like enjoy whatever comic.

3336
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:47,790
Like in terms of the feud
that you had with ned.

3337
01:30:48,330 --> 01:30:48,841
Some people are like,

3338
01:30:48,841 --> 01:30:50,780
you have to be either a
Joe Rogan fan of work.

3339
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:51,690
Carlos been CFN.

3340
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:52,650
You gotta be a fan of both.

3341
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,090
You can be a fan of no,

3342
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,440
Larry the cable guy.

3343
01:30:55,470 --> 01:30:57,920
That's where I draw a line
that you're talking crazy side.

3344
01:30:57,950 --> 01:30:58,880
You're talking nonsense.

3345
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,990
You can be a fan of Larry the
cable guy and bill Belper.

3346
01:31:04,530 --> 01:31:04,831
Yeah,

3347
01:31:04,831 --> 01:31:06,030
but they don't hate each other.

3348
01:31:06,430 --> 01:31:07,020
Okay.

3349
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:07,330
Right.

3350
01:31:07,330 --> 01:31:08,163
Different.

3351
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:09,091
I get that.

3352
01:31:09,091 --> 01:31:10,980
Is it different than apparently
I was saying x amount earlier.

3353
01:31:10,981 --> 01:31:12,840
It's a vendors that say x man,

3354
01:31:13,110 --> 01:31:13,680
Xanax one.

3355
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:13,781
Oh,

3356
01:31:13,781 --> 01:31:17,190
are you getting those all the same
shit to me comics and give a fuck.

3357
01:31:17,790 --> 01:31:18,660
But it's just like,

3358
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:22,020
like people who enjoy a certain music.

3359
01:31:22,290 --> 01:31:23,120
Like if you like,

3360
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:24,870
if you enjoy the band

3361
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:31,430
name your band that is supposedly
shitty it sure of kiss done.

3362
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:36,930
I've had people get angry at me because
I love kiss fuck off sue and the pixies

3363
01:31:36,931 --> 01:31:40,590
can suck it and you're such a simple band.

3364
01:31:40,591 --> 01:31:43,680
They can't place pyrotechnics
and facial makeup

3365
01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:46,141
musicians.

3366
01:31:46,141 --> 01:31:46,500
It's like,

3367
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:49,230
or I can listen to their
music and it makes me happy.

3368
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:53,790
Or you're moody and you're just a moody
bitch and you need people to cry and

3369
01:31:53,791 --> 01:31:54,510
their songs.

3370
01:31:54,510 --> 01:31:55,320
Hey,

3371
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:56,070
guess what?

3372
01:31:56,070 --> 01:31:57,840
Sometimes I like listening to Motorhead.

3373
01:31:57,900 --> 01:31:59,590
Sometimes I like listening to

3374
01:32:00,630 --> 01:32:01,390
Sadik.

3375
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:02,590
Sometimes I like listening to her.

3376
01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:04,040
I think you'd have to say
it different than that.

3377
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:04,910
Yeah.

3378
01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:05,980
Shaq Smith.

3379
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:08,650
Yeah.

3380
01:32:08,650 --> 01:32:09,580
Sometimes I like that.

3381
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:11,920
Sometimes I want to rock and roll
all night and party every day.

3382
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:13,810
How about fuck when?

3383
01:32:13,950 --> 01:32:14,350
When?

3384
01:32:14,350 --> 01:32:17,680
Whenever I accomplish anything
halfway decent in my career,

3385
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:19,060
and this is absolutely true.

3386
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:20,230
I go into my car,

3387
01:32:20,231 --> 01:32:21,940
I played Katy Perry's firework.

3388
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:26,950
I rolled down the window and I lip
sing the shit out of that song.

3389
01:32:26,951 --> 01:32:27,281
I'm like,

3390
01:32:27,281 --> 01:32:27,870
he was running.

3391
01:32:27,870 --> 01:32:29,200
I go nuts with that song.

3392
01:32:29,230 --> 01:32:31,450
Isn't it funny though with people
that people actually do do that?

3393
01:32:31,451 --> 01:32:33,130
They don't like people for their choices?

3394
01:32:33,131 --> 01:32:33,370
Like,

3395
01:32:33,370 --> 01:32:33,491
Oh,

3396
01:32:33,491 --> 01:32:34,540
you fucking listen to that.

3397
01:32:34,690 --> 01:32:38,220
Like there was a guy that had a fucking
bit about that way back in Boston.

3398
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:38,710
Oh,

3399
01:32:38,710 --> 01:32:39,700
it was Barry Crimmins.

3400
01:32:40,450 --> 01:32:45,450
Barry Crimmins a hilarious comedian who
bobcat Goldthwait has a documentary that

3401
01:32:45,641 --> 01:32:48,970
he did about them cause apparently Barry
was like molested when he was younger.

3402
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:51,790
He's got a documentary called call
me lucky or they call me lucky.

3403
01:32:52,210 --> 01:32:54,760
It's supposed to be like
really dark and really good.

3404
01:32:55,050 --> 01:32:55,390
You know,

3405
01:32:55,390 --> 01:32:56,980
bobcat is awesome.

3406
01:32:56,981 --> 01:32:58,000
I'm Rachel maker,

3407
01:32:58,270 --> 01:32:59,050
but um,

3408
01:32:59,050 --> 01:32:59,770
anyway,

3409
01:32:59,770 --> 01:33:00,101
um,

3410
01:33:00,101 --> 01:33:04,380
he had a bit about going to the record
store and the clerk at the record store

3411
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:06,670
like you listening to this and those guys.

3412
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:07,720
Fuck you man.

3413
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:08,650
It brings me joy.

3414
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:13,270
That doesn't affect you
in any way whatsoever.

3415
01:33:13,660 --> 01:33:13,990
Yeah.

3416
01:33:13,990 --> 01:33:14,531
Get out of here.

3417
01:33:14,531 --> 01:33:15,110
That's it.

3418
01:33:15,110 --> 01:33:16,740
That's Barry Crimmins and I dunno,

3419
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,060
what are they doing with their pose there?

3420
01:33:18,130 --> 01:33:18,963
Don't know.

3421
01:33:19,390 --> 01:33:19,720
I don't know.

3422
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:19,930
Look,

3423
01:33:19,930 --> 01:33:21,720
it looks like they're trying
to look like dwarves Bob.

3424
01:33:21,730 --> 01:33:22,181
Let's say this.

3425
01:33:22,181 --> 01:33:22,421
Oh,

3426
01:33:22,421 --> 01:33:23,254
good gorillas.

3427
01:33:23,630 --> 01:33:25,600
Gorillas are standing
up in their back things.

3428
01:33:26,860 --> 01:33:27,430
Yeah.

3429
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:28,660
Barry Crimmins was like,

3430
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:30,550
back when I was starting out,

3431
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,310
I was an open miker he was
already established comedian.

3432
01:33:33,311 --> 01:33:34,320
He was like one of these,

3433
01:33:34,321 --> 01:33:35,260
you start in Boston too.

3434
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:35,710
Yeah.

3435
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:36,130
Yeah.

3436
01:33:36,130 --> 01:33:37,400
He was one of the,

3437
01:33:37,450 --> 01:33:42,190
like the main guard of the
established comedians in Boston,

3438
01:33:42,191 --> 01:33:43,450
like to establish headliners,

3439
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:43,931
like really,

3440
01:33:43,931 --> 01:33:45,100
really respected guy.

3441
01:33:45,101 --> 01:33:47,380
Very original political,

3442
01:33:47,381 --> 01:33:48,280
very political,

3443
01:33:48,281 --> 01:33:50,500
just very just very wise guy.

3444
01:33:50,670 --> 01:33:52,000
That's a really good things to say.

3445
01:33:52,001 --> 01:33:53,860
He's really good to follow on Twitter too.

3446
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:58,230
His Twitter is filled with a
very good points and also he,

3447
01:33:58,270 --> 01:34:01,150
he'll tweet some great articles
and stuff and different things.

3448
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:04,990
But a bobcat also started out in Boston.

3449
01:34:04,991 --> 01:34:05,824
So bomb.

3450
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:07,000
He uh,

3451
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:11,020
he did this documentary on Barry and I
don't think it comes out for a couple

3452
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:11,021
months,

3453
01:34:11,021 --> 01:34:13,390
but I think right now they're
touring and doing the,

3454
01:34:13,391 --> 01:34:14,224
um,

3455
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:14,951
you know,

3456
01:34:14,951 --> 01:34:16,580
the festival thing,

3457
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:18,010
trying to get it up there.

3458
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:18,990
Fantastic man.

3459
01:34:20,110 --> 01:34:21,580
I'll put that fucking thing down in.

3460
01:34:21,581 --> 01:34:23,080
Contribute to be a part of the show.

3461
01:34:23,420 --> 01:34:24,253
The periscope,

3462
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:25,573
periscope.

3463
01:34:25,710 --> 01:34:26,543
Uh,

3464
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:27,790
no.

3465
01:34:27,790 --> 01:34:32,620
Do you like consume all like movies
or whatever that's standup related?

3466
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:35,530
Like can you watch like
the new Kevin Pollak one?

3467
01:34:35,570 --> 01:34:36,490
What's new Kevin Pollak?

3468
01:34:36,491 --> 01:34:37,260
One something wrong.

3469
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:38,950
People be a miserable misery.

3470
01:34:38,951 --> 01:34:39,521
Loves comedy,

3471
01:34:39,521 --> 01:34:43,390
loves misery or something like that and
see that I've got that queued up ready

3472
01:34:43,391 --> 01:34:44,224
to go when I get home.

3473
01:34:44,230 --> 01:34:44,651
So I was like,

3474
01:34:44,651 --> 01:34:45,011
I like,

3475
01:34:45,011 --> 01:34:46,420
I love all those types of movies.

3476
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:47,380
I like some of them,

3477
01:34:47,381 --> 01:34:50,080
but we're around comedy all the time.

3478
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:54,070
I don't need someone to tell me what
comedy is and I don't need someone just

3479
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:56,770
like the idea that I'll do
comedians have to be miserable.

3480
01:34:56,771 --> 01:34:57,710
Let's this.

3481
01:34:57,711 --> 01:35:00,350
Like I have friends and aren't
miserable in the comedians.

3482
01:35:00,351 --> 01:35:01,550
I don't have to explore that.

3483
01:35:01,610 --> 01:35:01,911
I mean,

3484
01:35:01,911 --> 01:35:03,110
yeah cause you cause you know,

3485
01:35:03,111 --> 01:35:03,771
or it's like,

3486
01:35:03,771 --> 01:35:06,650
or it's like you could just sit back
and enjoy their art and say like,

3487
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:07,370
okay,

3488
01:35:07,370 --> 01:35:07,790
yeah.

3489
01:35:07,790 --> 01:35:08,180
Like do you have,

3490
01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:11,870
do you have to go into the mental state
of a Jackson Pollock or can you just sit

3491
01:35:11,871 --> 01:35:12,500
back and be like,

3492
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:12,711
wow,

3493
01:35:12,711 --> 01:35:13,580
there's some cool paintings?

3494
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:14,541
Yeah.

3495
01:35:14,541 --> 01:35:14,981
Well like,

3496
01:35:14,981 --> 01:35:15,530
um,

3497
01:35:15,530 --> 01:35:15,681
well,

3498
01:35:15,681 --> 01:35:19,280
I mean I don't think there's a problem
with exploring whether or not comedians

3499
01:35:19,281 --> 01:35:19,731
are miserable.

3500
01:35:19,731 --> 01:35:20,001
It just,

3501
01:35:20,001 --> 01:35:21,080
I don't want to do it.

3502
01:35:21,170 --> 01:35:22,220
I don't need to do it.

3503
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:24,500
I don't like that idea either.

3504
01:35:24,501 --> 01:35:28,970
That you could just want everybody
together like are all musicians dickheads,

3505
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:29,590
right?

3506
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:29,990
Right.

3507
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:30,980
Musicians are dickheads.

3508
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:31,390
Sure.

3509
01:35:31,390 --> 01:35:32,600
Who was the thing you
sent me the other day?

3510
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:34,240
Stone temple pilots guide.

3511
01:35:34,370 --> 01:35:35,181
Oh my God.

3512
01:35:35,181 --> 01:35:38,840
Scott Wieland wasted on something or,

3513
01:35:38,841 --> 01:35:39,674
but he,

3514
01:35:39,740 --> 01:35:40,880
that was sad to watch.

3515
01:35:41,010 --> 01:35:41,240
He,

3516
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:42,470
he's not in the band anymore.

3517
01:35:42,471 --> 01:35:42,681
Right.

3518
01:35:42,681 --> 01:35:43,780
They kicked him and kicked him out.

3519
01:35:43,810 --> 01:35:46,730
Now the lead in Lincoln
Park is touring with them.

3520
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:49,580
Wasn't that the same Banjo that
you saw at a private party?

3521
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:52,940
UFC party or this is Dana
White's birthday party.

3522
01:35:52,941 --> 01:35:56,240
His 40th birthday I think
it was and God damn it dude.

3523
01:35:56,270 --> 01:35:58,100
They fucking nailed it.

3524
01:35:58,130 --> 01:36:00,830
They did that show at a private party.

3525
01:36:00,860 --> 01:36:03,770
There was only a few hundred people there
and they did that show as if it was a

3526
01:36:03,771 --> 01:36:04,880
packed arena.

3527
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:05,531
I loved it.

3528
01:36:05,531 --> 01:36:06,364
I mean he did.

3529
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:08,270
He had is the Bull Horn,

3530
01:36:08,450 --> 01:36:08,661
you know,

3531
01:36:08,661 --> 01:36:09,830
he does like some of his songs.

3532
01:36:09,831 --> 01:36:11,480
He sing some of it like the change,

3533
01:36:11,481 --> 01:36:12,620
the sound of his voice.

3534
01:36:12,621 --> 01:36:14,950
He sings into a bull.

3535
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:16,100
It was us,

3536
01:36:16,230 --> 01:36:17,240
Scott Scott Weiland.

3537
01:36:17,290 --> 01:36:17,610
Yeah.

3538
01:36:17,610 --> 01:36:17,810
Yeah.

3539
01:36:17,810 --> 01:36:18,800
He's a bad motherfucker.

3540
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:19,400
STP.

3541
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:20,233
Let me hear this.

3542
01:36:24,050 --> 01:36:24,781
He just had the party.

3543
01:36:24,781 --> 01:36:25,160
Oh,

3544
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:26,860
I can tell you right now that guy,

3545
01:36:26,861 --> 01:36:28,590
he can't even balance correctly.

3546
01:36:29,220 --> 01:36:30,570
That dude is something,

3547
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:31,930
he's on some hair.

3548
01:36:31,931 --> 01:36:35,520
All as Joe Diaz would say dancing.

3549
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:37,110
He's moving in slow motion.

3550
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:38,153
Yeah,

3551
01:36:43,830 --> 01:36:45,270
I bet he's having a good time though.

3552
01:36:45,330 --> 01:36:46,163
Sure.

3553
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:47,641
Yeah.

3554
01:36:47,641 --> 01:36:48,211
Oh my God.

3555
01:36:48,211 --> 01:36:49,044
He's tripping.

3556
01:36:50,390 --> 01:36:51,223
Let me hear this.

3557
01:37:10,010 --> 01:37:10,430
It's one,

3558
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:11,263
it's one node.

3559
01:37:11,390 --> 01:37:12,223
He's just,

3560
01:37:12,710 --> 01:37:13,130
he's,

3561
01:37:13,130 --> 01:37:13,911
he's heron.

3562
01:37:13,911 --> 01:37:15,230
Dabbing my eyes.

3563
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:16,700
Dead Eyes.

3564
01:37:17,830 --> 01:37:17,920
It

3565
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:20,020
was the total opposite of this.

3566
01:37:20,230 --> 01:37:21,580
You saw like jumping around.

3567
01:37:21,581 --> 01:37:22,414
It's moving.

3568
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:22,950
Yeah.

3569
01:37:22,950 --> 01:37:24,220
I mean he was crushing it.

3570
01:37:24,250 --> 01:37:24,970
I was really,

3571
01:37:24,970 --> 01:37:25,803
really,

3572
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:26,111
you know,

3573
01:37:26,111 --> 01:37:27,700
I have no musical talent at all,

3574
01:37:27,701 --> 01:37:30,360
so I love watching musicians
because you've watched musicians,

3575
01:37:30,361 --> 01:37:34,360
you can kind of get this inspiration from
them that's totally unrelated to what

3576
01:37:34,361 --> 01:37:34,920
you do.

3577
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:39,340
And like I was really impressed with
him as a performer just as just as an

3578
01:37:39,370 --> 01:37:39,851
artist.

3579
01:37:39,851 --> 01:37:40,151
I was like,

3580
01:37:40,151 --> 01:37:43,540
this guy's fucking bringing in
because he's showing up to some,

3581
01:37:43,830 --> 01:37:44,010
yeah.

3582
01:37:44,010 --> 01:37:45,730
Was showing up to some private party.

3583
01:37:45,850 --> 01:37:48,370
They probably got all fucking
ass load of money she had.

3584
01:37:48,371 --> 01:37:51,280
Apparently he was a nightmare
to deal with backstage.

3585
01:37:51,281 --> 01:37:54,460
They were threatening to walk if
the show didn't start right now.

3586
01:37:54,461 --> 01:37:55,980
Like it was all this craziness to it.

3587
01:37:55,981 --> 01:37:58,590
Like it wasn't chill about
the experience at all.

3588
01:37:58,591 --> 01:37:59,424
But yeah,

3589
01:37:59,490 --> 01:37:59,970
the one,

3590
01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:00,570
but you know,

3591
01:38:00,570 --> 01:38:02,880
maybe he's amped up to get up there
because once you got up there,

3592
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:05,100
he was fucking smashing it.

3593
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:07,590
It was sorry it was so tight.

3594
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:12,630
Spoons and like everything he was doing
was such like energetic and focused and

3595
01:38:12,730 --> 01:38:13,650
I was super,

3596
01:38:13,651 --> 01:38:14,131
super,

3597
01:38:14,131 --> 01:38:15,030
super impressed.

3598
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:18,090
It's cool and you can see someone
who's really in their element,

3599
01:38:18,091 --> 01:38:18,331
you're like,

3600
01:38:18,331 --> 01:38:18,541
oh yeah,

3601
01:38:18,541 --> 01:38:20,570
you were absolutely put on
this planet to be a rock star.

3602
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:23,100
Like this is what you
do and you're fantastic.

3603
01:38:23,150 --> 01:38:24,150
I would never say that,

3604
01:38:24,151 --> 01:38:25,830
but I would say he's nailing it.

3605
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:26,060
Yeah,

3606
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:28,230
he's whatever it is that
takes to be a rock star,

3607
01:38:28,231 --> 01:38:30,120
that guy is in that groove.

3608
01:38:30,121 --> 01:38:31,280
He's in that headspace.

3609
01:38:31,290 --> 01:38:32,550
He's worked really hard.

3610
01:38:32,551 --> 01:38:36,270
He's done all the preparation necessary
and he's producing it in a very,

3611
01:38:36,271 --> 01:38:38,380
very high level that that's,

3612
01:38:38,430 --> 01:38:39,630
that's one thing I definitely would say.

3613
01:38:39,631 --> 01:38:43,290
I don't think anybody's born to be a
rock star or born to be a poet or any of

3614
01:38:43,291 --> 01:38:43,890
that.

3615
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:46,560
There's a lot of silliness when
it comes to that kind of shit.

3616
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:51,000
I think some people's
personalities because of
whatever reason are better suited

3617
01:38:51,001 --> 01:38:52,020
for certain activities.

3618
01:38:52,021 --> 01:38:52,890
But that makes sense.

3619
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:55,020
I don't think anybody's
born to do anything,

3620
01:38:55,140 --> 01:38:55,680
you know,

3621
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:56,070
they just,

3622
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:58,290
they just kind of discover
where they kind of,

3623
01:38:58,350 --> 01:39:01,740
where their talent or where
their personality can sort
of fit the best and then

3624
01:39:01,741 --> 01:39:02,280
they just,

3625
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:02,760
yeah,

3626
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:03,350
accelerate.

3627
01:39:03,350 --> 01:39:03,601
I mean,

3628
01:39:03,601 --> 01:39:05,160
find what you enjoy and do it.

3629
01:39:05,190 --> 01:39:06,210
I mean like for you,

3630
01:39:06,510 --> 01:39:06,841
like,

3631
01:39:06,841 --> 01:39:07,081
you know,

3632
01:39:07,081 --> 01:39:08,100
you're in college,

3633
01:39:08,670 --> 01:39:10,650
men see it brings you on stage.

3634
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:11,070
You,

3635
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:11,361
you,

3636
01:39:11,361 --> 01:39:14,160
you say funny shit and you
realize I can be funny.

3637
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:15,330
Holy Fuck.

3638
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:16,770
Like the next thing you know,

3639
01:39:16,771 --> 01:39:16,981
I mean,

3640
01:39:16,981 --> 01:39:17,880
what was that process like?

3641
01:39:17,881 --> 01:39:19,110
Did you get home and start writing?

3642
01:39:19,111 --> 01:39:20,370
Did you start watching comedy?

3643
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:21,120
Like what did you do?

3644
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:22,140
Consumed everything.

3645
01:39:22,740 --> 01:39:23,573
One moment.

3646
01:39:23,670 --> 01:39:24,503
One Blip.

3647
01:39:25,110 --> 01:39:28,110
Just cause I got a laugh and it was,

3648
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:29,910
it was a sold out.

3649
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:32,250
It was a sold out improv
and I was just like,

3650
01:39:32,251 --> 01:39:32,580
wow,

3651
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:33,590
this is in,

3652
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:34,231
I mean,

3653
01:39:34,231 --> 01:39:34,561
you know,

3654
01:39:34,561 --> 01:39:34,951
the,

3655
01:39:34,951 --> 01:39:35,371
the,

3656
01:39:35,371 --> 01:39:39,420
the drug of standup of being on stage and
sang something and then having a whole

3657
01:39:39,421 --> 01:39:39,790
room,

3658
01:39:39,790 --> 01:39:41,220
a stranger is just laugh.

3659
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:42,083
And it was,

3660
01:39:42,150 --> 01:39:43,050
and that,

3661
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:44,100
and for me,

3662
01:39:44,430 --> 01:39:48,750
I've always used laughter is like kind
of a defense mechanism because when I,

3663
01:39:48,910 --> 01:39:50,010
when I meet people,

3664
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:53,550
I try to immediately make a dwarf joke
just so they're comfortable just so they

3665
01:39:53,551 --> 01:39:54,090
like go like,

3666
01:39:54,090 --> 01:39:54,390
oh,

3667
01:39:54,390 --> 01:39:54,601
okay,

3668
01:39:54,601 --> 01:39:55,434
he's cool with it.

3669
01:39:55,670 --> 01:39:56,550
And then I can kind of,

3670
01:39:56,551 --> 01:39:57,930
and now and now we can be friends.

3671
01:39:57,960 --> 01:39:59,310
Like now we can move on past that.

3672
01:39:59,790 --> 01:40:00,480
Uh,

3673
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:03,330
so that's like something
you learned over the years.

3674
01:40:04,010 --> 01:40:05,850
It has to do with the way
your dad sort of like,

3675
01:40:05,910 --> 01:40:06,743
absolutely.

3676
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:07,261
Absolutely.

3677
01:40:07,261 --> 01:40:07,930
Because,

3678
01:40:07,930 --> 01:40:09,040
and you know,

3679
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:11,190
cause then if I don't talk about it,

3680
01:40:11,191 --> 01:40:13,500
then people are like on pins and needles
because they don't know if they're

3681
01:40:13,501 --> 01:40:16,920
going to offend me or if they're going
to like say something that's going to set

3682
01:40:16,921 --> 01:40:17,290
me off,

3683
01:40:17,290 --> 01:40:17,611
you know,

3684
01:40:17,611 --> 01:40:18,444
so there,

3685
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:20,250
so if I make that quick joke,

3686
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:20,710
then they're like,

3687
01:40:20,710 --> 01:40:21,470
oh,

3688
01:40:21,470 --> 01:40:22,020
okay,

3689
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:22,853
you're fine.

3690
01:40:23,010 --> 01:40:23,520
Um,

3691
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:24,450
I don't have to worry about it.

3692
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:25,590
Uh,

3693
01:40:25,590 --> 01:40:26,280
so yeah,

3694
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:27,180
as soon as I went on stage,

3695
01:40:27,181 --> 01:40:29,820
the first time I went home and I just
started writing like crazy and just

3696
01:40:29,821 --> 01:40:33,150
started writing all the stories
that I've told it parties for years,

3697
01:40:33,151 --> 01:40:34,920
just of experiences and,

3698
01:40:35,310 --> 01:40:36,390
and things like that.

3699
01:40:36,391 --> 01:40:38,100
And you started watching a ton of comedy.

3700
01:40:38,101 --> 01:40:41,400
Someone showed me that
Jerry Seinfeld documentary,

3701
01:40:41,550 --> 01:40:42,630
a comedian,

3702
01:40:42,990 --> 01:40:43,500
and I was like,

3703
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:44,430
I was an man.

3704
01:40:44,610 --> 01:40:46,080
That's a sneaky documentary.

3705
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:46,981
You know why?

3706
01:40:46,981 --> 01:40:50,400
Because he put [inaudible] Adams in
that movie to make himself look good.

3707
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:52,140
I know he did.

3708
01:40:52,650 --> 01:40:54,400
I know he put already like already,

3709
01:40:54,401 --> 01:40:54,810
like he,

3710
01:40:54,810 --> 01:40:56,440
they focused on like what?

3711
01:40:56,890 --> 01:40:58,450
They come to you and they say,

3712
01:40:58,451 --> 01:40:59,260
look,

3713
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:02,080
you're going to be at a documentary
about comedy with Jerry Seinfeld.

3714
01:41:02,150 --> 01:41:02,500
Like,

3715
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:03,520
fuck yeah man,

3716
01:41:03,790 --> 01:41:04,990
you're a struggling comic.

3717
01:41:05,230 --> 01:41:09,850
And they narrow in on this neurotic guy.

3718
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:10,720
It was a mess.

3719
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:12,330
And he's freaking out
and he's trying to get,

3720
01:41:12,580 --> 01:41:13,210
and they just,

3721
01:41:13,210 --> 01:41:16,520
he's got no experience being on camera
and you just fucking shove this Cameron

3722
01:41:17,110 --> 01:41:18,340
and then contrast it.

3723
01:41:18,341 --> 01:41:20,020
Makes Jerry Seinfeld look very,

3724
01:41:20,050 --> 01:41:20,790
very likely.

3725
01:41:20,790 --> 01:41:24,970
He's polished and he's done this for
years and now he's trying to do the new

3726
01:41:24,971 --> 01:41:25,481
act.

3727
01:41:25,481 --> 01:41:26,220
And I'm like,

3728
01:41:26,220 --> 01:41:26,530
Eh.

3729
01:41:26,530 --> 01:41:27,970
But then at the same time like,

3730
01:41:27,971 --> 01:41:28,721
and then as comics,

3731
01:41:28,721 --> 01:41:29,680
we know this now,

3732
01:41:29,890 --> 01:41:30,790
like yeah,

3733
01:41:30,791 --> 01:41:32,680
Jerry Seinfeld was trying
to write new material,

3734
01:41:32,681 --> 01:41:35,110
but w w and when he's going on stage,

3735
01:41:35,111 --> 01:41:36,670
like he's done this a thousand times.

3736
01:41:36,671 --> 01:41:39,940
So that scene where he's essentially
trying to think of a word or a bombing as

3737
01:41:39,941 --> 01:41:40,780
some people would say,

3738
01:41:41,050 --> 01:41:44,560
he's very comfortable in that
scenario because he knows what to do.

3739
01:41:44,590 --> 01:41:48,220
And he's very analytical cause
he's done it a million times.

3740
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:50,740
It's not already to wear when he goes on,

3741
01:41:50,741 --> 01:41:51,250
he's,

3742
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:51,551
you know,

3743
01:41:51,551 --> 01:41:54,990
he's neurotic and he's learning
all this stuff because yeah,

3744
01:41:55,030 --> 01:41:55,900
I saw that movie.

3745
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:56,410
I thought I,

3746
01:41:56,410 --> 01:41:57,280
I thought I knew Warren,

3747
01:41:57,281 --> 01:41:57,940
he Adams.

3748
01:41:57,940 --> 01:41:59,020
And then I actually met the guy,

3749
01:41:59,021 --> 01:41:59,410
I'm like,

3750
01:41:59,410 --> 01:42:00,190
oh,

3751
01:42:00,190 --> 01:42:01,023
you're fucking cool.

3752
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:02,160
It's just a normal dude.

3753
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:03,220
But you know,

3754
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:04,090
they edit it,

3755
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:08,640
they focus on all the most ridiculous
shit does get their cameras phase.

3756
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:11,110
You have Barry Katz
breaking you down on camera,

3757
01:42:11,111 --> 01:42:13,600
which is a posture as the whole thing.

3758
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:15,161
I saw that,

3759
01:42:15,161 --> 01:42:15,401
I'm like,

3760
01:42:15,401 --> 01:42:19,600
they set this dude up like they used
him and his fucking documentary.

3761
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:20,950
But you know,

3762
01:42:20,950 --> 01:42:24,520
if you really going to show a guy
creating a new material or guy,

3763
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:27,220
you got to kind of do a guy
who is not loved already.

3764
01:42:27,670 --> 01:42:28,330
Right.

3765
01:42:28,330 --> 01:42:28,791
You know,

3766
01:42:28,791 --> 01:42:32,740
you can't walk on stage and get a standing
ovation before you've said one word.

3767
01:42:32,741 --> 01:42:34,150
So that's where [inaudible] comes in.

3768
01:42:34,151 --> 01:42:34,451
Right.

3769
01:42:34,451 --> 01:42:35,290
So it's,

3770
01:42:35,530 --> 01:42:36,580
I think they kinda,

3771
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:39,910
it helps to have a guy like that we
can follow following another guy,

3772
01:42:39,911 --> 01:42:40,744
but on the way up,

3773
01:42:40,930 --> 01:42:42,010
why did they choose or [inaudible],

3774
01:42:42,070 --> 01:42:42,903
you know,

3775
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:45,190
choose the guy who's not
going to overshadow him.

3776
01:42:45,730 --> 01:42:46,563
You know,

3777
01:42:47,110 --> 01:42:47,771
it's interesting like,

3778
01:42:47,771 --> 01:42:48,071
you know,

3779
01:42:48,071 --> 01:42:52,600
they didn't do like a Kevin Hart type
character or some big powerful energetic

3780
01:42:52,601 --> 01:42:54,550
performer would just crushes and like,

3781
01:42:54,551 --> 01:42:54,911
well hell,

3782
01:42:54,911 --> 01:42:55,451
they have all this.

3783
01:42:55,451 --> 01:42:58,480
They had the one scene
at a Caroline's where,

3784
01:42:58,481 --> 01:42:59,650
I don't know who the comic was.

3785
01:42:59,651 --> 01:43:00,281
It might've been an angel.

3786
01:43:00,281 --> 01:43:01,114
Cells are,

3787
01:43:01,330 --> 01:43:02,190
but it got out.

3788
01:43:02,300 --> 01:43:02,540
Yeah.

3789
01:43:02,540 --> 01:43:02,810
Yeah.

3790
01:43:02,810 --> 01:43:03,670
Chicago chicken out.

3791
01:43:03,910 --> 01:43:04,331
We're like,

3792
01:43:04,331 --> 01:43:07,000
he was doing his costume
changes on stage at,

3793
01:43:07,210 --> 01:43:07,451
yeah,

3794
01:43:07,451 --> 01:43:08,284
I think it was Caroline's.

3795
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:10,060
And then you see Jerry in the back like,

3796
01:43:10,210 --> 01:43:10,331
well,

3797
01:43:10,331 --> 01:43:11,770
how am I going to follow this?

3798
01:43:12,010 --> 01:43:13,780
They got how many people want after this?

3799
01:43:13,910 --> 01:43:14,361
Be Fun.

3800
01:43:14,361 --> 01:43:14,531
Yeah.

3801
01:43:14,531 --> 01:43:15,640
Just walk on stage and say,

3802
01:43:15,641 --> 01:43:15,791
hi,

3803
01:43:15,791 --> 01:43:16,690
I'm Jerry Seinfeld.

3804
01:43:16,691 --> 01:43:17,650
Didn't tell a couple of jokes.

3805
01:43:17,651 --> 01:43:18,011
Boom.

3806
01:43:18,011 --> 01:43:19,810
You following it until jokes
that are actually good.

3807
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:20,050
Yeah,

3808
01:43:20,050 --> 01:43:20,501
you're fine.

3809
01:43:20,501 --> 01:43:21,161
Don't worry about it,

3810
01:43:21,161 --> 01:43:21,460
dude.

3811
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:22,293
That's it.

3812
01:43:22,870 --> 01:43:23,111
But yeah.

3813
01:43:23,111 --> 01:43:23,381
Yeah.

3814
01:43:23,381 --> 01:43:24,040
I just,

3815
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:25,900
I just consumed all things comedy.

3816
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:27,730
I never saw that I am comic either.

3817
01:43:27,870 --> 01:43:28,331
It was just,

3818
01:43:28,331 --> 01:43:30,880
that was the documentary that everybody
always quotes because that's the one

3819
01:43:30,881 --> 01:43:31,400
where I'm in.

3820
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:33,340
He admits the steel in
material and he does that.

3821
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:35,080
That interview was talking about.

3822
01:43:35,650 --> 01:43:35,921
Yeah,

3823
01:43:35,921 --> 01:43:36,491
I steal.

3824
01:43:36,491 --> 01:43:37,330
Of course I steal.

3825
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:37,961
You know,

3826
01:43:37,961 --> 01:43:39,700
if I'm on stage you better run bitch.

3827
01:43:42,090 --> 01:43:43,490
I was sarcastic.

3828
01:43:44,530 --> 01:43:45,880
I think it was doing to be sarcastic.

3829
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:47,620
Can't do that if you actually are.

3830
01:43:47,630 --> 01:43:47,900
Yeah,

3831
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:51,680
that's how do you do that if
you actually are a plagiarist.

3832
01:43:51,681 --> 01:43:52,160
I mean that's,

3833
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:53,180
that's preposterous.

3834
01:43:53,990 --> 01:43:54,823
But that's how,

3835
01:43:54,860 --> 01:43:56,450
that's all I know about that documentary.

3836
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:57,321
Oh yeah.

3837
01:43:57,321 --> 01:43:59,280
Cause I'm sure people tweeted
you that clip like that.

3838
01:43:59,290 --> 01:44:02,510
See is that a touchy subject with
you and talk about your friend?

3839
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:03,730
Yeah,

3840
01:44:03,730 --> 01:44:04,220
kind of.

3841
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:05,001
Cause it's like guy,

3842
01:44:05,001 --> 01:44:05,750
he's my friend,

3843
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:06,140
you know,

3844
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:06,690
and,

3845
01:44:06,690 --> 01:44:10,100
and we're still friends and so
we still text every now and then.

3846
01:44:10,110 --> 01:44:10,690
Hell.

3847
01:44:10,690 --> 01:44:15,690
So some of your fans will probably
like when that thing was at its peak,

3848
01:44:16,340 --> 01:44:17,040
uh,

3849
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:19,010
there was a moment where some,

3850
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:20,360
your fans will probably hate me for this,

3851
01:44:20,361 --> 01:44:24,110
but he called me up and was like,

3852
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:24,973
I'm quitting.

3853
01:44:25,190 --> 01:44:26,420
I'm not doing this anymore.

3854
01:44:26,450 --> 01:44:27,410
I'm not doing standup anymore.

3855
01:44:27,411 --> 01:44:27,711
I'm not,

3856
01:44:27,711 --> 01:44:28,250
I'm out.

3857
01:44:28,250 --> 01:44:28,700
I'm just,

3858
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:29,450
this is too much.

3859
01:44:29,450 --> 01:44:30,283
I can't.

3860
01:44:30,350 --> 01:44:31,183
And I like,

3861
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:36,140
I was on the phone with them for like
three hours and like talk him in the back

3862
01:44:36,141 --> 01:44:36,974
into doing it.

3863
01:44:37,550 --> 01:44:37,820
Yeah,

3864
01:44:37,820 --> 01:44:38,040
I know.

3865
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:38,873
See Yeah.

3866
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:42,910
Nothing wrong with him doing stand up.

3867
01:44:43,180 --> 01:44:44,290
Cause you know that's not,

3868
01:44:44,330 --> 01:44:45,710
there was never the issue.

3869
01:44:46,460 --> 01:44:51,460
What the issue always was was he was
victimizing other comedians and you might

3870
01:44:52,671 --> 01:44:54,530
not known it because you weren't around.

3871
01:44:54,590 --> 01:44:56,360
I went around the scene,

3872
01:44:56,390 --> 01:44:56,661
I like,

3873
01:44:56,661 --> 01:44:59,310
I like mystery and,

3874
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:00,350
and this,

3875
01:45:00,410 --> 01:45:03,380
and the sad part is is cause
because I was with him on the road,

3876
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:07,640
I would see things happen during the
day and then him go on stage that night,

3877
01:45:07,940 --> 01:45:12,740
do 20 minutes on what happened during
the day and have it be brilliant stuff.

3878
01:45:13,070 --> 01:45:17,930
I'll be the first one to say he's a great
comic when he's like being a comedian,

3879
01:45:18,050 --> 01:45:18,920
you know what the problem is?

3880
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:22,220
People get addicted to killing and
they want to kill all the time.

3881
01:45:22,550 --> 01:45:23,960
And when they don't have something to say,

3882
01:45:24,410 --> 01:45:25,880
they'll take somebody else's shit.

3883
01:45:26,150 --> 01:45:27,320
And that's the reality of it.

3884
01:45:27,350 --> 01:45:29,030
It's a lack of artistic integrity.

3885
01:45:29,110 --> 01:45:29,871
And that's the reality.

3886
01:45:29,871 --> 01:45:31,040
It doesn't mean you're not talented.

3887
01:45:31,250 --> 01:45:32,360
It's like we were talking about before,

3888
01:45:32,361 --> 01:45:33,320
there's grays,

3889
01:45:33,710 --> 01:45:35,180
there's not everybody's good,

3890
01:45:35,540 --> 01:45:36,860
everybody's bad or you know,

3891
01:45:36,861 --> 01:45:38,630
everybody on this side is good
everybody and that's how it's bad.

3892
01:45:38,631 --> 01:45:40,760
It's not that some people
are really talented,

3893
01:45:40,761 --> 01:45:41,690
but they're,

3894
01:45:41,930 --> 01:45:44,830
they also have questionable
ethics and that's,

3895
01:45:44,870 --> 01:45:45,681
that's reality.

3896
01:45:45,681 --> 01:45:49,580
And because what is most important
to them is adulation and love.

3897
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:51,200
It's filling up that hole.

3898
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:53,150
Whatever that hold it was created.

3899
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:54,490
We all have a whole,

3900
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:57,470
every comic has a hole that
was created by their childhood.

3901
01:45:57,770 --> 01:45:58,790
Some more than others.

3902
01:45:58,820 --> 01:45:59,031
Sure.

3903
01:45:59,031 --> 01:45:59,390
No,

3904
01:45:59,390 --> 01:45:59,870
some,

3905
01:45:59,870 --> 01:46:01,340
some in a different way than others.

3906
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:02,173
Everybody's,

3907
01:46:02,180 --> 01:46:03,320
everybody's varies.

3908
01:46:03,710 --> 01:46:08,710
And some people that the need to kill is
way more important than the need to be

3909
01:46:09,231 --> 01:46:10,910
original and the need to be creative.

3910
01:46:11,390 --> 01:46:13,430
And when they don't have anything to say,

3911
01:46:13,610 --> 01:46:14,151
when they don't,

3912
01:46:14,151 --> 01:46:14,984
they can't.

3913
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:16,520
They can't find something.

3914
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:17,750
They'll just steal.

3915
01:46:17,990 --> 01:46:19,190
And once they steal,

3916
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:23,130
they steal all the time and one
state that becomes what they do then.

3917
01:46:23,420 --> 01:46:24,920
And they do it to their friends.

3918
01:46:24,921 --> 01:46:26,540
They do it to people they don't know.

3919
01:46:26,541 --> 01:46:29,480
They do it to open Miker as they sit in
the back room and they write things down

3920
01:46:29,870 --> 01:46:31,640
and he's not the only one
that's ever done this.

3921
01:46:31,910 --> 01:46:35,180
He was the only one that was ever
called out for it and got busted for it.

3922
01:46:35,270 --> 01:46:36,320
Public and publicly.

3923
01:46:36,321 --> 01:46:36,650
Yeah.

3924
01:46:36,650 --> 01:46:37,340
Cause you know,

3925
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:39,380
and these things still happen today where,

3926
01:46:39,381 --> 01:46:39,710
you know,

3927
01:46:39,710 --> 01:46:41,930
behind the scenes someone
comes up Sean and says,

3928
01:46:41,931 --> 01:46:43,170
hey look,

3929
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:43,510
there's,

3930
01:46:43,510 --> 01:46:44,690
it's still an issue.

3931
01:46:44,850 --> 01:46:47,720
Like artistic integrity is
always going to be an issue.

3932
01:46:48,070 --> 01:46:50,220
There's for sure parallel thinking

3933
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:50,911
for sure.

3934
01:46:50,911 --> 01:46:51,570
There's,

3935
01:46:51,570 --> 01:46:53,820
there's going to be people that
come up with similar jokes.

3936
01:46:53,821 --> 01:46:56,190
Like there's always something
that happens in the news,

3937
01:46:56,191 --> 01:47:01,191
like Kanye West interrupting Taylor
Swift's is going to be a bunch of people

3938
01:47:02,521 --> 01:47:04,070
that have a joke about that.

3939
01:47:04,090 --> 01:47:07,020
I see with Twitter you'll
see it because I met when,

3940
01:47:07,030 --> 01:47:07,500
um,

3941
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:08,880
I remember when Bruce Jenner,

3942
01:47:08,940 --> 01:47:09,120
uh,

3943
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:11,260
gotten to that car accident and,

3944
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:12,273
and the,

3945
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:13,320
and the woman died.

3946
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:17,220
One of the first tweets I
saw was Neal Brennan saying,

3947
01:47:17,490 --> 01:47:17,970
great.

3948
01:47:17,970 --> 01:47:20,520
Now every comics going to say that,

3949
01:47:20,521 --> 01:47:21,354
uh,

3950
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:23,760
Bruce Jenner's really becoming
a woman because he can't drive.

3951
01:47:23,820 --> 01:47:26,610
And that like that was his
tweet and then sure enough,

3952
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:31,170
within minutes you saw Comedians
tweet that joke like sure.

3953
01:47:31,230 --> 01:47:34,490
It just filled up the line because
that's the most obvious punchline there.

3954
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:35,390
Right?

3955
01:47:35,390 --> 01:47:38,400
Like you have all these
eyes looking to one topic.

3956
01:47:38,401 --> 01:47:38,610
Yeah.

3957
01:47:38,610 --> 01:47:39,840
That's what they're going to come up with.

3958
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:41,180
It was pretty fucked up that they,

3959
01:47:41,190 --> 01:47:43,680
did they even bring that up
in the two hours that no.

3960
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:44,230
Oh,

3961
01:47:44,230 --> 01:47:45,180
by the way,

3962
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:48,030
by not paying attention.

3963
01:47:48,070 --> 01:47:48,903
Right.

3964
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:49,500
Yeah,

3965
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:50,350
and it was taught,

3966
01:47:50,430 --> 01:47:54,510
I mean anybody else in that
similar situation like that
would be the main focal

3967
01:47:54,511 --> 01:47:55,020
point.

3968
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:56,130
Oh by the way,

3969
01:47:56,280 --> 01:48:00,240
you fucking weren't paying attention
while you were driving giant truck with a

3970
01:48:00,241 --> 01:48:01,830
fucking boat behind it,

3971
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:03,180
which I used to mashed.

3972
01:48:03,640 --> 01:48:04,110
What do you mean?

3973
01:48:04,110 --> 01:48:07,440
I think on the PCAS that somebody said
that you're not supposed to have trailers

3974
01:48:07,441 --> 01:48:10,800
or something on that street
because of that reason.

3975
01:48:10,801 --> 01:48:12,450
I've stopped being fast Google that.

3976
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:13,380
Find out if that's true,

3977
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,580
but I don't know if that's true.

3978
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:15,840
Could be true.

3979
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:19,050
You could have done the Diane Sawyer
interview on the fact that you fucking

3980
01:48:19,051 --> 01:48:20,280
killed someone a month ago.

3981
01:48:22,410 --> 01:48:23,220
A month ago.

3982
01:48:23,220 --> 01:48:23,670
Yeah.

3983
01:48:23,670 --> 01:48:24,900
Glossed over it like it was,

3984
01:48:24,901 --> 01:48:25,621
that's not important.

3985
01:48:25,621 --> 01:48:30,621
What's important is a woman are you a
woman and kills people by negligence,

3986
01:48:32,590 --> 01:48:35,670
by pure negligence while
you're smoking his cigarette.

3987
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:37,470
And I think I heard,

3988
01:48:37,471 --> 01:48:37,920
um,

3989
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:41,640
I heard a her Corolla talk about this
and I thought it was really interesting.

3990
01:48:41,641 --> 01:48:42,474
I mean,

3991
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:47,460
the fact that like I think the car he
hit and then she veered off into oncoming

3992
01:48:47,461 --> 01:48:49,000
traffic and the car that hit her,

3993
01:48:49,001 --> 01:48:51,470
it was like a homer and that,

3994
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:52,920
that part sucks cause you're like,

3995
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:53,611
well,

3996
01:48:53,611 --> 01:48:54,930
if you get hit by a yard,

3997
01:48:55,980 --> 01:48:56,813
good.

3998
01:48:56,940 --> 01:48:58,830
Ars Ars is a,

3999
01:48:58,940 --> 01:48:59,371
I don't know,

4000
01:48:59,371 --> 01:49:00,204
it's a little,

4001
01:49:00,570 --> 01:49:01,410
little tiny car.

4002
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:02,700
It's not that,

4003
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:03,860
yeah,

4004
01:49:03,860 --> 01:49:04,693
it doesn't matter.

4005
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:05,161
But like,

4006
01:49:05,161 --> 01:49:05,311
yeah,

4007
01:49:05,311 --> 01:49:08,220
you get hit by any sort of
regular to pull up a yard.

4008
01:49:08,450 --> 01:49:09,000
It's fine.

4009
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:09,510
It's a,

4010
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:11,880
it taped the interview before
the car accident it says,

4011
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,470
oh,

4012
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:15,090
well there you go.

4013
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:15,953
There you go.

4014
01:49:16,270 --> 01:49:16,380
Oh,

4015
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:17,430
so okay.

4016
01:49:17,490 --> 01:49:17,671
Oh,

4017
01:49:17,671 --> 01:49:18,000
okay.

4018
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:18,151
Yeah,

4019
01:49:18,151 --> 01:49:18,720
there it is.

4020
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:22,290
I mean that makes them kind of like
an asterisk tapered so long ago.

4021
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:22,801
Yeah.

4022
01:49:22,801 --> 01:49:23,341
And then not,

4023
01:49:23,341 --> 01:49:25,020
and then just sit on it.

4024
01:49:25,140 --> 01:49:25,790
Yeah.

4025
01:49:25,790 --> 01:49:26,623
That's interesting.

4026
01:49:27,380 --> 01:49:27,840
But yeah,

4027
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:28,800
it gives a fuck really.

4028
01:49:29,030 --> 01:49:32,430
But it was the whole thing of where like
out of all the cars on the road that

4029
01:49:32,431 --> 01:49:33,091
hit you head on,

4030
01:49:33,091 --> 01:49:35,040
it had to be a hummer and that's not good.

4031
01:49:35,070 --> 01:49:35,790
No,

4032
01:49:35,790 --> 01:49:38,070
it's just negligence like that.

4033
01:49:38,071 --> 01:49:40,980
It's just so infuriating and to have it,

4034
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:42,480
you know,

4035
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:44,220
from a person that's in the public guy,

4036
01:49:44,221 --> 01:49:45,480
people get really angry about it.

4037
01:49:45,481 --> 01:49:46,260
But in this set,

4038
01:49:46,260 --> 01:49:48,010
in this case it seems to be

4039
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:48,821
like fading.

4040
01:49:48,821 --> 01:49:52,770
Like no one really seems to give a shit
about it other than the people that

4041
01:49:52,780 --> 01:49:53,740
directly knew and they're like,

4042
01:49:53,741 --> 01:49:55,090
there's people that are trying to sue,

4043
01:49:55,091 --> 01:49:57,910
but then the stepdaughters and apparently
they didn't even have a relationship

4044
01:49:57,911 --> 01:49:59,170
with a woman and they're suing.

4045
01:49:59,230 --> 01:49:59,490
They're like,

4046
01:49:59,490 --> 01:49:59,720
oh,

4047
01:49:59,720 --> 01:50:00,740
but you took away their,

4048
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:04,120
my chance to rekindle that
relationship so I deserve $1 million.

4049
01:50:04,330 --> 01:50:09,330
It was kind of the true God who the fuck
is to say that I was going to call her

4050
01:50:09,941 --> 01:50:10,480
tomorrow.

4051
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:14,860
If there's anybody that deserves
like money from like a lawsuit.

4052
01:50:14,890 --> 01:50:18,130
It's not the people suing Manny Pacquiao
for 5 million bucks cause he had a hurt

4053
01:50:18,131 --> 01:50:18,964
shoulder.

4054
01:50:19,030 --> 01:50:20,140
It's the people who,

4055
01:50:20,220 --> 01:50:20,450
well,

4056
01:50:20,450 --> 01:50:20,591
Hey,

4057
01:50:20,591 --> 01:50:21,910
Bruce Jenner killed my mom.

4058
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,260
Okay,

4059
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:23,810
okay,

4060
01:50:23,810 --> 01:50:24,051
sorry,

4061
01:50:24,051 --> 01:50:24,884
I got some money.

4062
01:50:25,010 --> 01:50:25,310
He's,

4063
01:50:25,310 --> 01:50:26,350
it's not only these broke.

4064
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:27,693
Let's keep that.

4065
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:28,870
Let's give you some money for that.

4066
01:50:29,290 --> 01:50:29,980
It's a,

4067
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:32,830
and you almost never
hear about that anymore.

4068
01:50:32,860 --> 01:50:34,090
You don't hear about the fact that he,

4069
01:50:34,091 --> 01:50:35,140
it's all hear about it at all.

4070
01:50:35,141 --> 01:50:35,321
No,

4071
01:50:35,321 --> 01:50:37,390
it's just in becoming
a woman now fades away.

4072
01:50:37,430 --> 01:50:38,680
It fades away into oblivion.

4073
01:50:39,010 --> 01:50:43,080
It's interesting how the public decides
to fixate on certain things and not fix

4074
01:50:43,081 --> 01:50:43,960
it on other things.

4075
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:48,400
Like I was thinking about that when
it came to this police violence case,

4076
01:50:48,790 --> 01:50:49,091
you know,

4077
01:50:49,091 --> 01:50:52,060
the public will decide which
one to Freddie gray one.

4078
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:53,200
There's one that sticks,

4079
01:50:53,540 --> 01:50:57,580
but this South Carolina one where the
cops shot the guy in the back on video

4080
01:50:57,581 --> 01:50:58,630
just wanting away.

4081
01:50:58,631 --> 01:50:59,710
The guy was running away.

4082
01:50:59,730 --> 01:51:00,070
Yeah.

4083
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:02,170
It wasn't a guy who died
in the back of a van.

4084
01:51:02,290 --> 01:51:04,600
It was a guy who's running
away and the cop shoots.

4085
01:51:04,610 --> 01:51:04,880
I'm like,

4086
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:05,500
come on.

4087
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:06,760
That one didn't stick.

4088
01:51:06,820 --> 01:51:08,140
I am shocked.

4089
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:08,711
Well,

4090
01:51:08,711 --> 01:51:09,580
it's like a,

4091
01:51:09,970 --> 01:51:14,380
it was kind of like a few
years ago and all these,

4092
01:51:14,620 --> 01:51:16,150
a bunch of comics made jokes about it,

4093
01:51:16,151 --> 01:51:17,580
but it was like whenever he,

4094
01:51:17,770 --> 01:51:19,510
when it was like missing kid time,

4095
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:20,910
it was like we're this,

4096
01:51:21,100 --> 01:51:22,810
every story is going to
be a new missing kid.

4097
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:27,340
And everyone made the joke that was all
like good looking white women and not

4098
01:51:27,550 --> 01:51:28,110
just girls.

4099
01:51:28,110 --> 01:51:31,300
There's so many other missing
kids and now it's Kinda like that.

4100
01:51:31,301 --> 01:51:32,830
But with police brutality,

4101
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:37,570
like it's almost like the news
just sits down one day and says,

4102
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:39,130
why are we going to focus on this week?

4103
01:51:39,190 --> 01:51:39,490
Like,

4104
01:51:39,490 --> 01:51:39,970
like,

4105
01:51:39,970 --> 01:51:40,810
like what's going to happen?

4106
01:51:40,811 --> 01:51:41,860
Did you see nightcrawler?

4107
01:51:42,170 --> 01:51:43,003
Yes.

4108
01:51:43,030 --> 01:51:43,990
That's a perfect,

4109
01:51:44,620 --> 01:51:45,940
perfect movie.

4110
01:51:45,970 --> 01:51:48,340
If you want to understand like this whole,

4111
01:51:48,430 --> 01:51:49,650
like this leads,

4112
01:51:49,651 --> 01:51:52,300
it leads style of news.

4113
01:51:52,660 --> 01:51:55,930
Well it also gives you really
a real insight into what,

4114
01:51:56,110 --> 01:51:57,640
what a new show is.

4115
01:51:57,670 --> 01:51:59,440
It's an entertainment program.

4116
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:00,490
They're trying to get ratings.

4117
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:01,560
Same way everyone else is you.

4118
01:52:01,570 --> 01:52:03,220
They're not trying to enlighten you,

4119
01:52:03,221 --> 01:52:04,780
they're not trying to educate you.

4120
01:52:04,781 --> 01:52:08,740
They are just trying to somehow or
another get you to pay attention.

4121
01:52:09,250 --> 01:52:10,140
That's why I like a,

4122
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:11,113
the,

4123
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:13,900
the speech and the TV show,

4124
01:52:13,901 --> 01:52:14,770
the newsroom.

4125
01:52:14,830 --> 01:52:15,663
Uh,

4126
01:52:15,670 --> 01:52:17,170
it was near the beginning
of the first season,

4127
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:17,890
uh,

4128
01:52:17,890 --> 01:52:21,670
Jeff Daniels plays the news broadcaster
and he talks about what the news was

4129
01:52:21,671 --> 01:52:26,110
designed to be and how there were people
that when the news was first conceived,

4130
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:26,530
they,

4131
01:52:26,530 --> 01:52:27,221
they said,

4132
01:52:27,221 --> 01:52:28,060
no ads,

4133
01:52:28,420 --> 01:52:29,410
no sponsors,

4134
01:52:29,890 --> 01:52:32,200
government funded or I mean,

4135
01:52:32,230 --> 01:52:35,660
how then you go and do a whole nother
part where they can't talk about different

4136
01:52:35,661 --> 01:52:35,861
people.

4137
01:52:35,861 --> 01:52:36,551
But yeah,

4138
01:52:36,551 --> 01:52:39,900
it's like a no sponsors to where
they have to get ratings just right.

4139
01:52:39,930 --> 01:52:41,350
This is the news.

4140
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:43,690
It's going to be put on by taxpayer money.

4141
01:52:43,900 --> 01:52:44,830
You pay a little extra,

4142
01:52:45,170 --> 01:52:46,190
get you get the news.

4143
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:48,620
So now it's not people with the,

4144
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:49,190
uh,

4145
01:52:49,190 --> 01:52:51,050
the news ticker at the bottom,

4146
01:52:51,051 --> 01:52:53,030
trying to sensationalize everything.

4147
01:52:53,330 --> 01:52:56,070
What did Hillary Clinton really
mean when she said Bubba,

4148
01:52:56,160 --> 01:52:56,550
Bubba,

4149
01:52:56,550 --> 01:52:56,810
Bubba,

4150
01:52:56,810 --> 01:52:59,540
Mclaren's are Democrats and
they're fighting and like,

4151
01:52:59,690 --> 01:53:02,480
so the news casters
don't have that to go to.

4152
01:53:02,950 --> 01:53:06,200
And I thought that was a great
little monologue that made,

4153
01:53:06,590 --> 01:53:07,550
that made me kind of think like,

4154
01:53:07,551 --> 01:53:07,881
yeah,

4155
01:53:07,881 --> 01:53:08,600
why do we,

4156
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:10,820
like why is the news have to be ratings?

4157
01:53:10,821 --> 01:53:12,080
Cause and it's like you said,

4158
01:53:12,110 --> 01:53:14,350
it's an entertainment
show and it's all it is.

4159
01:53:14,790 --> 01:53:15,740
At the end of the day,

4160
01:53:16,070 --> 01:53:16,460
the traffic,

4161
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:17,840
they're trying to get eyes to try there,

4162
01:53:17,850 --> 01:53:18,860
try and get sponsors.

4163
01:53:18,861 --> 01:53:19,694
They're trying to get,

4164
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,020
they're trying to get ratings.

4165
01:53:21,050 --> 01:53:21,381
So yeah,

4166
01:53:21,381 --> 01:53:23,520
you're going to lead with uh,

4167
01:53:23,650 --> 01:53:24,170
you know,

4168
01:53:24,170 --> 01:53:27,480
does sensationalized murders and the a,

4169
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:29,030
that's how you get
people to pay attention.

4170
01:53:29,031 --> 01:53:29,840
It's the only way.

4171
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:31,610
It's also like what we
were talking about earlier.

4172
01:53:31,611 --> 01:53:36,611
It's like when you run into like most
people that you communicate with online,

4173
01:53:37,311 --> 01:53:38,144
like my,

4174
01:53:38,150 --> 01:53:43,150
my interactions with people on Twitter
and on Instagram or Facebook are almost

4175
01:53:43,790 --> 01:53:45,080
universally positive.

4176
01:53:45,081 --> 01:53:47,150
There's very few negative people,

4177
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:48,013
but I've run into,

4178
01:53:48,310 --> 01:53:49,040
and most of his,

4179
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:52,010
because I'm nice and I don't
cause too much bullshit,

4180
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:54,080
but I say controversial shit.

4181
01:53:54,100 --> 01:53:54,521
She just,

4182
01:53:54,521 --> 01:53:56,030
I run into enough nice people,

4183
01:53:56,031 --> 01:53:57,890
but there's a certain
percentage that are just,

4184
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:01,040
and it's just a numbers game.

4185
01:54:01,540 --> 01:54:02,150
Well when you,

4186
01:54:02,150 --> 01:54:03,470
when you're dealing with the news,

4187
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:09,280
if you try to put on an hour show and
you're dealing with the events of 7

4188
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:14,150
billion people and the Nepal
earthquake and the typhoon that hit the

4189
01:54:14,151 --> 01:54:14,984
Philippines,

4190
01:54:15,380 --> 01:54:18,740
this and the that and the that and the
this and the murder and the dads and the

4191
01:54:18,741 --> 01:54:22,700
cop and the shot and the boy
and the baby and the window,

4192
01:54:22,701 --> 01:54:27,701
and you can just fill that hour up with
these events because the sheer numbers,

4193
01:54:28,700 --> 01:54:29,990
if you just looked out,

4194
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:34,130
if you opened up your window and you
looked at your apartment and you saw 7

4195
01:54:34,130 --> 01:54:34,491
billion people,

4196
01:54:34,491 --> 01:54:35,001
you'd be like,

4197
01:54:35,001 --> 01:54:35,420
well,

4198
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:37,970
of course some shit's going down.

4199
01:54:38,390 --> 01:54:39,560
There's too many people.

4200
01:54:40,090 --> 01:54:41,180
It's going to happen.

4201
01:54:41,350 --> 01:54:42,950
And the events that you're dealing with,

4202
01:54:43,010 --> 01:54:48,010
if you're dealing with even like one
100th of 1% of chaos and violence,

4203
01:54:49,390 --> 01:54:49,760
sure.

4204
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:50,840
That's pretty good.

4205
01:54:50,841 --> 01:54:53,150
When you consider what the
world must have been like,

4206
01:54:53,340 --> 01:54:53,750
you know,

4207
01:54:53,750 --> 01:54:54,111
five,

4208
01:54:54,111 --> 01:54:55,190
6,000 years ago,

4209
01:54:55,550 --> 01:54:59,570
people just fucking show up and you cut
your village in half with swords and

4210
01:54:59,571 --> 01:55:00,051
then just say,

4211
01:55:00,051 --> 01:55:00,321
all right,

4212
01:55:00,321 --> 01:55:01,010
we own it now.

4213
01:55:01,010 --> 01:55:01,341
Yeah.

4214
01:55:01,341 --> 01:55:04,430
Flaming Arrows to go flying into
the algorithm and doing this again.

4215
01:55:04,730 --> 01:55:05,270
You know,

4216
01:55:05,270 --> 01:55:06,440
that was the news.

4217
01:55:06,470 --> 01:55:06,621
I mean,

4218
01:55:06,621 --> 01:55:08,690
that was what the news was back then.

4219
01:55:08,720 --> 01:55:11,390
The news was you open up your window
and people are trying to kill you here.

4220
01:55:11,870 --> 01:55:13,130
Here's who your king is now.

4221
01:55:13,170 --> 01:55:13,760
All right,

4222
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:14,450
great.

4223
01:55:14,450 --> 01:55:18,260
So if you try to like
pack a 7 billion person,

4224
01:55:19,340 --> 01:55:22,940
like a report on the
events of 7 billion people,

4225
01:55:23,090 --> 01:55:25,310
how the fuck are you going
to do that in an hour?

4226
01:55:25,340 --> 01:55:27,830
You're not and you're not
getting an hour by the way,

4227
01:55:27,831 --> 01:55:28,790
you get 44 minutes,

4228
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:29,881
the commercial,

4229
01:55:29,881 --> 01:55:32,780
the minutes or 16 minutes
commercials and they're like,

4230
01:55:32,781 --> 01:55:33,890
the news is biased and you're like,

4231
01:55:33,891 --> 01:55:34,251
well yeah,

4232
01:55:34,251 --> 01:55:35,120
for that reason,

4233
01:55:35,121 --> 01:55:37,700
because they have to look
at all events and say,

4234
01:55:37,701 --> 01:55:39,320
which ones do we want to focus on?

4235
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:39,531
Well,

4236
01:55:39,531 --> 01:55:40,060
data there,

4237
01:55:40,060 --> 01:55:41,900
their job is not to educate,

4238
01:55:41,901 --> 01:55:42,734
you know,

4239
01:55:42,740 --> 01:55:44,280
their job is to get you to pay attention.

4240
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:44,731
That's it.

4241
01:55:44,731 --> 01:55:47,730
And we have this idea that somehow or
another they're like our educators,

4242
01:55:47,930 --> 01:55:49,140
not like this is the news.

4243
01:55:49,141 --> 01:55:53,940
And you know when you hear them talking
in that strange way that news casters

4244
01:55:53,941 --> 01:55:55,740
talk calm Brokaw voice.

4245
01:55:55,860 --> 01:55:56,310
Yeah.

4246
01:55:56,310 --> 01:56:00,720
It's my favorite is when
they uncomfortably tried
to comment on things in

4247
01:56:00,721 --> 01:56:01,470
between storage.

4248
01:56:01,470 --> 01:56:02,520
Well that's upsetting,

4249
01:56:02,730 --> 01:56:04,170
but it certainly is

4250
01:56:04,570 --> 01:56:05,403
next door.

4251
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:07,460
Yeah,

4252
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:12,460
the local news broadcast like after the
last story and that 20 seconds at the

4253
01:56:14,651 --> 01:56:18,880
end of the broadcast where they have
to like be funny or just interact.

4254
01:56:19,540 --> 01:56:21,340
Did you see that one where

4255
01:56:21,660 --> 01:56:24,090
the a woman was talking to a black guy?

4256
01:56:24,091 --> 01:56:25,530
There was a woman who was a white,

4257
01:56:25,710 --> 01:56:29,400
a newscaster and she had a black eye
with her and they were talking about lady

4258
01:56:29,401 --> 01:56:29,971
Gaga.

4259
01:56:29,971 --> 01:56:34,971
Lady Gaga did a performance and she
starts calling it Jigaboo Mu Music to see

4260
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,280
she doesn't know what
Jigaboo is apparently.

4261
01:56:38,670 --> 01:56:39,500
Have you seen that?

4262
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:40,380
Listen to this

4263
01:56:42,750 --> 01:56:43,141
course.

4264
01:56:43,141 --> 01:56:43,974
It's Fox News

4265
01:56:45,550 --> 01:56:49,450
and called it listen,

4266
01:56:50,370 --> 01:56:51,203
this.

4267
01:57:00,670 --> 01:57:01,503
Oh my God.

4268
01:57:02,580 --> 01:57:03,361
How about the black?

4269
01:57:03,361 --> 01:57:04,110
I just saw I going,

4270
01:57:04,110 --> 01:57:04,943
yup.

4271
01:57:06,640 --> 01:57:07,700
Wire right there.

4272
01:57:08,090 --> 01:57:10,010
I have a mortgage or a robot.

4273
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:13,010
Has there been anything like that though
that you've said that you didn't know?

4274
01:57:13,220 --> 01:57:15,440
I didn't know it was racist to say,

4275
01:57:15,441 --> 01:57:16,910
hey boy to a black guy.

4276
01:57:16,970 --> 01:57:21,140
Like I remember saying it moved to La
and I remember the first year I was out

4277
01:57:21,141 --> 01:57:21,490
there,

4278
01:57:21,490 --> 01:57:23,270
you never say hey boy to a white guy.

4279
01:57:23,290 --> 01:57:23,740
Yeah.

4280
01:57:23,740 --> 01:57:24,573
Well I mean it was like,

4281
01:57:24,650 --> 01:57:25,340
what's up boy?

4282
01:57:25,340 --> 01:57:27,890
Until like I remember said that
to my friend and my friend goes,

4283
01:57:28,040 --> 01:57:28,380
what?

4284
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:28,730
What?

4285
01:57:28,730 --> 01:57:28,941
Wait,

4286
01:57:28,941 --> 01:57:29,421
what you just saying?

4287
01:57:29,421 --> 01:57:29,661
It was like,

4288
01:57:29,661 --> 01:57:30,494
boy,

4289
01:57:30,620 --> 01:57:31,160
Guy,

4290
01:57:31,160 --> 01:57:31,993
hey man.

4291
01:57:32,150 --> 01:57:32,690
He goes,

4292
01:57:32,690 --> 01:57:33,200
do you know what?

4293
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:34,930
You shouldn't say boy to a black a hit.

4294
01:57:34,940 --> 01:57:35,960
And then he explained to me like,

4295
01:57:36,110 --> 01:57:37,490
I've never heard this before in my life.

4296
01:57:37,820 --> 01:57:40,340
Well now we're going
through that with a trainee.

4297
01:57:40,700 --> 01:57:41,470
Like you can't,

4298
01:57:41,470 --> 01:57:44,720
like you can still say cabbie
though for cab drivers.

4299
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:45,620
So cling to that.

4300
01:57:47,310 --> 01:57:47,841
They won't,

4301
01:57:47,841 --> 01:57:50,480
they won't even exist in
another few years after Uber.

4302
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:53,900
Like did I tell you I
took a cab the other day,

4303
01:57:53,960 --> 01:57:58,370
I did not know how much more expensive
it was and how bitter they have.

4304
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:59,570
Like the second I got in there,

4305
01:57:59,630 --> 01:58:02,300
that's all they talked about
was how horrible Uber was.

4306
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:03,441
Uber.

4307
01:58:03,441 --> 01:58:03,621
No,

4308
01:58:03,621 --> 01:58:04,310
I had no,

4309
01:58:04,310 --> 01:58:04,731
I didn't say.

4310
01:58:04,731 --> 01:58:05,060
And I was like,

4311
01:58:05,060 --> 01:58:05,893
oh thanks man.

4312
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:06,500
Yeah,

4313
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:06,590
I,

4314
01:58:06,590 --> 01:58:07,060
you know,

4315
01:58:07,060 --> 01:58:12,060
my phone's dead so I couldn't call Uber
so I couldn't so I couldn't call because

4316
01:58:12,831 --> 01:58:13,071
I was,

4317
01:58:13,071 --> 01:58:16,080
I had to flag down a taxi and uh,

4318
01:58:16,081 --> 01:58:17,320
it has like my phones,

4319
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:19,190
I couldn't call a and he goes,

4320
01:58:19,191 --> 01:58:20,780
oh that's the word Uber.

4321
01:58:20,900 --> 01:58:21,920
And the whole time,

4322
01:58:21,921 --> 01:58:22,670
the whole ride home,

4323
01:58:22,670 --> 01:58:24,080
he was just bitching about Uber.

4324
01:58:24,081 --> 01:58:24,320
Sure.

4325
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:25,820
Cause they had a monopoly in the market.

4326
01:58:25,821 --> 01:58:27,620
Then someone figured
out how to do it better.

4327
01:58:27,680 --> 01:58:32,680
And you ran into a cunt and it was $20
more like it costs are the same run.

4328
01:58:34,430 --> 01:58:34,641
Yeah.

4329
01:58:34,641 --> 01:58:35,331
For the exact same.

4330
01:58:35,331 --> 01:58:35,511
Right.

4331
01:58:35,511 --> 01:58:37,340
I've taken a million times with Uber,

4332
01:58:37,430 --> 01:58:38,330
20 hours more.

4333
01:58:38,710 --> 01:58:39,543
How do the,

4334
01:58:39,550 --> 01:58:40,600
how do they get paid?

4335
01:58:40,630 --> 01:58:42,160
They get a check from Uber.

4336
01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:42,911
Is that how that works?

4337
01:58:42,911 --> 01:58:43,090
Yeah,

4338
01:58:43,090 --> 01:58:44,290
I think it's twice a month.

4339
01:58:44,291 --> 01:58:46,050
It's direct deposited into their,

4340
01:58:46,051 --> 01:58:48,640
you do any background checks on
the people that are involved?

4341
01:58:48,641 --> 01:58:48,850
Yes.

4342
01:58:48,850 --> 01:58:49,683
Boasts two.

4343
01:58:49,890 --> 01:58:52,570
And now with all the
latest news and stuff,

4344
01:58:52,571 --> 01:58:54,070
it's gotten more intense.

4345
01:58:54,071 --> 01:58:54,641
But uh,

4346
01:58:54,641 --> 01:58:55,450
it's still,

4347
01:58:55,450 --> 01:58:56,560
it's still easy.

4348
01:58:56,561 --> 01:58:56,780
I mean,

4349
01:58:56,780 --> 01:59:00,430
I know a ton of people who are comics
that are Uber drivers and I was like,

4350
01:59:00,431 --> 01:59:00,761
what?

4351
01:59:00,761 --> 01:59:01,600
You're driver?

4352
01:59:04,250 --> 01:59:05,870
Well David Seaman was a,

4353
01:59:05,890 --> 01:59:06,590
uh,

4354
01:59:06,590 --> 01:59:07,290
heard about that.

4355
01:59:07,290 --> 01:59:09,650
He does some fucking Uber
driving in his spare time.

4356
01:59:09,670 --> 01:59:10,800
That's just the pickup chicks.

4357
01:59:10,801 --> 01:59:12,480
I remember when dead mouse was doing it.

4358
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:12,750
He was,

4359
01:59:12,750 --> 01:59:17,430
we were driving up in Toronto
and they had his logo.

4360
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:19,140
Like you don't have to hit the car logo.

4361
01:59:19,170 --> 01:59:21,530
Like he was the 10 house mask and yeah,

4362
01:59:21,630 --> 01:59:23,370
that was odd that that was on the map.

4363
01:59:23,430 --> 01:59:28,350
Like that must be cool as fuck dead mouse
and trip driven around in a Ferrari.

4364
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:29,610
What if you have luggage though?

4365
01:59:30,350 --> 01:59:31,320
You can have a trunk.

4366
01:59:31,321 --> 01:59:32,154
You fuck.

4367
01:59:32,380 --> 01:59:32,610
Yeah.

4368
01:59:32,610 --> 01:59:34,680
Like could you imagine just
being on the side of the street,

4369
01:59:34,681 --> 01:59:34,920
be like,

4370
01:59:34,920 --> 01:59:37,260
I call this Uber then like
Gene Simmons pulls up.

4371
01:59:38,130 --> 01:59:39,690
Joe Rogan were very rich and powerful man.

4372
01:59:40,020 --> 01:59:45,020
And then to get back to their super
lucky to get someone who's not totally

4373
01:59:45,151 --> 01:59:46,370
retarded in your car though.

4374
01:59:46,370 --> 01:59:46,740
Yeah.

4375
01:59:46,740 --> 01:59:47,750
Well now like a,

4376
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:48,660
there's thing like,

4377
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:49,620
um,

4378
01:59:49,650 --> 01:59:53,700
Hillary like Hillary Duff is getting
a lot of press cause she's on Tinder.

4379
01:59:54,270 --> 01:59:56,250
She's like filming it
and stuff and like cute,

4380
01:59:56,310 --> 01:59:58,110
like she's trying to do a reality show.

4381
01:59:58,530 --> 01:59:59,970
I have no idea.

4382
02:00:00,580 --> 02:00:00,780
Yeah.

4383
02:00:00,780 --> 02:00:03,600
Jamie knows he's just nodding his head
over there cause that what she's doing.

4384
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:07,570
Let's go to our US weekly
report with Jamie watching.

4385
02:00:07,650 --> 02:00:11,070
Say that again for you did a few dates
and they filmed a couple things and they

4386
02:00:11,071 --> 02:00:11,670
went on.

4387
02:00:11,670 --> 02:00:13,800
Well she probably film it
just so nobody kills her,

4388
02:00:14,160 --> 02:00:14,600
right?

4389
02:00:14,600 --> 02:00:14,790
Yeah,

4390
02:00:14,790 --> 02:00:15,623
no shit.

4391
02:00:15,690 --> 02:00:18,390
Some psycho shows up and it's Hilary duff.

4392
02:00:18,510 --> 02:00:19,530
Speaking of Psychos,

4393
02:00:19,531 --> 02:00:21,150
I watched going clear last night.

4394
02:00:21,210 --> 02:00:24,180
Oh you haven't seen that before?

4395
02:00:24,210 --> 02:00:24,910
Oh my God.

4396
02:00:24,910 --> 02:00:26,760
I read part of the book soon.

4397
02:00:26,761 --> 02:00:28,650
Like some clips from the documentary,

4398
02:00:29,060 --> 02:00:30,510
but oh my God,

4399
02:00:30,511 --> 02:00:31,500
I watched it last night.

4400
02:00:31,501 --> 02:00:32,700
That is incredible.

4401
02:00:33,220 --> 02:00:36,060
You know Scientology is
down to only 50,000 members.

4402
02:00:36,120 --> 02:00:36,953
That's what they were saying.

4403
02:00:37,180 --> 02:00:41,430
And with that they still have whatever
dollars they have over a billion dollars

4404
02:00:41,431 --> 02:00:42,750
in care.

4405
02:00:43,240 --> 02:00:45,360
I mean there was a equity there.

4406
02:00:45,430 --> 02:00:49,590
There was like two sponsored tweets
today that I saw like by ontology,

4407
02:00:49,591 --> 02:00:50,520
Scientology,

4408
02:00:51,310 --> 02:00:53,460
they and what's their Twitter handle?

4409
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:58,290
I think it's just that Scientology or
at Church of Scientology or at we will

4410
02:00:58,291 --> 02:00:58,951
control you.

4411
02:00:58,951 --> 02:01:01,300
You small weak minded amp or something.

4412
02:01:01,340 --> 02:01:02,173
Something like that.

4413
02:01:02,430 --> 02:01:03,263
Uh,

4414
02:01:03,540 --> 02:01:04,373
and uh,

4415
02:01:04,600 --> 02:01:05,510
Scientology.

4416
02:01:05,620 --> 02:01:06,000
Yeah.

4417
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:06,950
How many people that have?

4418
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:08,970
28,000.

4419
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:09,451
Damn,

4420
02:01:09,451 --> 02:01:09,960
that's it.

4421
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:10,291
That's it.

4422
02:01:10,291 --> 02:01:11,124
That's it.

4423
02:01:11,160 --> 02:01:12,030
I have more followers.

4424
02:01:12,031 --> 02:01:13,710
A Scientology route.

4425
02:01:13,950 --> 02:01:15,090
28,000.

4426
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:15,840
But like,

4427
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:17,640
look what their top photo is like.

4428
02:01:17,641 --> 02:01:22,641
Their top photo of the
Church of Scientology is a
lobby of a hotel or building

4429
02:01:24,571 --> 02:01:26,400
that looks like a palace.

4430
02:01:26,790 --> 02:01:28,260
Like that's what their logo is.

4431
02:01:28,350 --> 02:01:29,370
Well that's the church.

4432
02:01:29,670 --> 02:01:30,630
That's where they party.

4433
02:01:31,110 --> 02:01:32,810
They give praise to Xenu.

4434
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:34,793
Yeah.

4435
02:01:35,210 --> 02:01:35,780
Neat.

4436
02:01:35,780 --> 02:01:38,580
Heikki a mother and scientologist.

4437
02:01:38,610 --> 02:01:39,443
Oh Wow.

4438
02:01:39,550 --> 02:01:44,550
So I guess they're like on a publicity
run to try to be the same way.

4439
02:01:45,141 --> 02:01:46,690
A seaworld now,

4440
02:01:46,710 --> 02:01:48,070
how that has those commercial,

4441
02:01:48,071 --> 02:01:48,841
yet we love our way.

4442
02:01:48,841 --> 02:01:50,690
Look at this because of Scientology.

4443
02:01:50,840 --> 02:01:54,350
May Yuku treats her young
son as an individual.

4444
02:01:54,410 --> 02:01:55,191
As a result,

4445
02:01:55,191 --> 02:01:56,150
he's a happier child.

4446
02:01:56,160 --> 02:01:56,930
Why?

4447
02:01:56,930 --> 02:02:00,440
As opposed to what you treat him
like he's a fucking puzzle piece.

4448
02:02:01,940 --> 02:02:02,960
What does that mean?

4449
02:02:03,070 --> 02:02:03,320
Yeah.

4450
02:02:03,320 --> 02:02:06,610
What parent isn't doing that and it's
because they're not a scientologist is

4451
02:02:06,611 --> 02:02:07,444
weird.

4452
02:02:08,130 --> 02:02:08,740
Weird.

4453
02:02:08,740 --> 02:02:09,030
Joe,

4454
02:02:09,030 --> 02:02:10,890
did you see the the the sea road,

4455
02:02:11,270 --> 02:02:15,680
like how that new commercial that they've
been playing since like we haven't

4456
02:02:15,681 --> 02:02:19,460
captured a Orca in the wild for
20 years or something like this,

4457
02:02:19,470 --> 02:02:22,010
forced them to breed
in captivity as slaves.

4458
02:02:22,980 --> 02:02:24,260
All cities going on.

4459
02:02:24,261 --> 02:02:25,760
I mean we're just confirming.

4460
02:02:26,660 --> 02:02:27,950
This is really wild man.

4461
02:02:27,950 --> 02:02:29,960
They're trying to go for
it to the diversity angle,

4462
02:02:29,961 --> 02:02:30,860
the Scientology,

4463
02:02:30,861 --> 02:02:31,790
a Twitter page,

4464
02:02:32,090 --> 02:02:36,470
the Scientology mission of Katmandu
serves as the base camp for Scientology,

4465
02:02:36,471 --> 02:02:40,400
Nepal Disaster Response
Hashtag Nepal quake.

4466
02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:41,750
We're helping.

4467
02:02:41,750 --> 02:02:42,140
Wow.

4468
02:02:42,140 --> 02:02:42,520
I don't know.

4469
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:47,520
I'm sure that'll help by
completely obliterated
psychiatry and the in the Nepal

4470
02:02:47,841 --> 02:02:49,610
region and then all the
people will be better.

4471
02:02:49,940 --> 02:02:54,680
It's just amazing when you see the
actual films of l Ron Hubbard talking.

4472
02:02:54,710 --> 02:02:55,210
Yes.

4473
02:02:55,210 --> 02:02:55,520
You know,

4474
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:56,780
that was what it was amazing.

4475
02:02:56,781 --> 02:02:57,770
And Paul Haggis,

4476
02:02:57,800 --> 02:03:01,100
the director like who like got
to like some super high level.

4477
02:03:01,101 --> 02:03:03,740
You get the handwritten
notes from l Ron Hubbard.

4478
02:03:03,741 --> 02:03:04,100
He was like,

4479
02:03:04,100 --> 02:03:05,540
what the fuck is this?

4480
02:03:05,870 --> 02:03:06,531
Did you see it?

4481
02:03:06,531 --> 02:03:07,380
Have you seen the document?

4482
02:03:08,330 --> 02:03:11,930
You have to because you
have to whole new level.

4483
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:12,920
That good.

4484
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:13,641
It's that good.

4485
02:03:13,641 --> 02:03:13,961
I,

4486
02:03:13,961 --> 02:03:16,190
I got it last night on HBO go.

4487
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:17,240
You ever use HBO go?

4488
02:03:17,300 --> 02:03:20,770
I just got it last night to go watch
the nirvana movies on there now.

4489
02:03:20,900 --> 02:03:21,300
Yeah,

4490
02:03:21,300 --> 02:03:21,930
go band thing.

4491
02:03:21,930 --> 02:03:22,550
Yeah.

4492
02:03:22,550 --> 02:03:23,660
I was going to watch that too,

4493
02:03:23,690 --> 02:03:24,141
but I said,

4494
02:03:24,141 --> 02:03:24,231
no,

4495
02:03:24,231 --> 02:03:25,064
I'm going to watch this.

4496
02:03:25,100 --> 02:03:26,000
I really,

4497
02:03:26,001 --> 02:03:27,140
it was late at night and I was like,

4498
02:03:27,170 --> 02:03:28,940
I'm just going to watch
this for like 10 15 minutes.

4499
02:03:29,050 --> 02:03:29,720
Nope.

4500
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:33,650
I was going to Lou to that
motherfucker for two whole hours.

4501
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:36,200
It's sad to men,

4502
02:03:36,201 --> 02:03:39,830
some of the people's bad experiences
with their children or with their family.

4503
02:03:39,831 --> 02:03:43,550
It's being taken away and being forced
to work on top of the roof of a building.

4504
02:03:43,551 --> 02:03:44,420
Fuck Dude.

4505
02:03:44,421 --> 02:03:48,710
It was how the mother whose daughter
won't talk to her anymore and the whole

4506
02:03:48,711 --> 02:03:53,090
family grew up Scientologists
and it's really hard to watch.

4507
02:03:53,150 --> 02:03:54,800
And then the guy who started taping,

4508
02:03:54,801 --> 02:03:56,570
the people that were out
in front of his house,

4509
02:03:56,571 --> 02:03:59,090
like the Scientologists out front of
his house to do a smear campaign against

4510
02:03:59,091 --> 02:03:59,180
them.

4511
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:01,910
I think it's really important whenever
you're talking about something like this

4512
02:04:01,911 --> 02:04:05,060
to look at both sides of it and
just does not look at both sides.

4513
02:04:05,450 --> 02:04:07,190
This is only one side of it.

4514
02:04:07,191 --> 02:04:08,500
I had a neighbor that was a Scientology,

4515
02:04:08,630 --> 02:04:11,300
actually I don't think he is anymore
and I don't live near him anymore,

4516
02:04:11,630 --> 02:04:13,430
but he was a scientologist.

4517
02:04:13,460 --> 02:04:17,200
He was the nicest fucking guy and he
was telling me how much it helped them,

4518
02:04:17,270 --> 02:04:17,841
how much it,

4519
02:04:17,841 --> 02:04:19,340
it got his life in order.

4520
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:22,280
So I don't think it's all negative.

4521
02:04:22,630 --> 02:04:23,463
I think there's,

4522
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:25,940
there's some horror fucking stories.

4523
02:04:25,970 --> 02:04:26,361
Well sure.

4524
02:04:26,361 --> 02:04:27,890
It's the same thing like uh,

4525
02:04:27,950 --> 02:04:31,490
like some of the nicest people I've
ever known in my life were Mormons.

4526
02:04:32,120 --> 02:04:32,953
Mormons are great.

4527
02:04:33,670 --> 02:04:34,140
Fantastic.

4528
02:04:34,140 --> 02:04:35,090
Her religion I would,

4529
02:04:35,230 --> 02:04:36,500
I really would pick more minutes.

4530
02:04:36,770 --> 02:04:37,603
I really,

4531
02:04:37,620 --> 02:04:38,100
I mean

4532
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:39,900
they're all family oriented.

4533
02:04:40,230 --> 02:04:43,410
They all like kept like tight knit or
they try to have tight knit families.

4534
02:04:43,411 --> 02:04:44,770
They really like supportive.

4535
02:04:44,970 --> 02:04:49,260
Their church functions are pretty pretty
and they'll and they all kind of band

4536
02:04:49,261 --> 02:04:50,640
together to help each other.

4537
02:04:50,641 --> 02:04:50,821
I mean,

4538
02:04:50,821 --> 02:04:55,821
granted then you have the instances were
polygamists and girls are being married

4539
02:04:56,671 --> 02:04:59,820
off at age 12 and like some
sort of weird sex though.

4540
02:04:59,970 --> 02:05:00,691
Mormonism,

4541
02:05:00,691 --> 02:05:02,340
they don't really have those though.

4542
02:05:02,730 --> 02:05:02,950
You know?

4543
02:05:02,950 --> 02:05:03,460
That's,

4544
02:05:03,460 --> 02:05:03,720
you know,

4545
02:05:03,720 --> 02:05:04,551
that's Mitt Romney.

4546
02:05:04,551 --> 02:05:06,120
Do you know how the whole
deal with Mitt Romney?

4547
02:05:06,270 --> 02:05:07,010
Oh No.

4548
02:05:07,010 --> 02:05:09,060
Oh this is great.

4549
02:05:09,230 --> 02:05:09,380
Oh,

4550
02:05:09,380 --> 02:05:14,380
this is my dad's like a
hardcore Republicans and
Mitt Romney's dad couldn't be

4551
02:05:15,541 --> 02:05:17,820
president because he was born in Mexico.

4552
02:05:18,090 --> 02:05:21,900
The reason why I was born in Mexico was
because Mitt Romney's family is from an

4553
02:05:21,901 --> 02:05:23,680
extreme sect of,

4554
02:05:23,960 --> 02:05:24,960
of Mormonism.

4555
02:05:24,961 --> 02:05:28,530
Then left the country when
polygamy became illegal.

4556
02:05:29,130 --> 02:05:33,660
So it left the country in the 18 hundreds
back when there was no cars when they

4557
02:05:33,661 --> 02:05:33,791
were,

4558
02:05:33,791 --> 02:05:34,470
there was no cars.

4559
02:05:34,470 --> 02:05:36,120
Mexico is just as cool as America.

4560
02:05:36,121 --> 02:05:37,170
It was probably even cooler.

4561
02:05:37,380 --> 02:05:37,600
So it,

4562
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:38,550
let's just go over there.

4563
02:05:38,740 --> 02:05:39,151
Fuck it.

4564
02:05:39,151 --> 02:05:39,361
We're on.

4565
02:05:39,361 --> 02:05:40,890
Horses would write one on differences.

4566
02:05:40,891 --> 02:05:42,060
May cause this land in the land.

4567
02:05:42,110 --> 02:05:42,281
Yeah,

4568
02:05:42,281 --> 02:05:43,200
you have a horse over here.

4569
02:05:43,201 --> 02:05:44,034
You have almost over there.

4570
02:05:44,100 --> 02:05:44,821
Have a worse over here.

4571
02:05:44,821 --> 02:05:45,990
You could have 15 wives,

4572
02:05:46,020 --> 02:05:46,440
you know,

4573
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:47,520
lock them up in a dungeon.

4574
02:05:47,521 --> 02:05:48,354
You have a party,

4575
02:05:48,570 --> 02:05:49,403
you know,

4576
02:05:49,830 --> 02:05:53,580
over here you have to have one wife and
they tell you what the fuck down you

4577
02:05:53,581 --> 02:05:54,480
have to pay taxes.

4578
02:05:54,481 --> 02:05:55,314
Get the fuck out of here.

4579
02:05:55,680 --> 02:05:56,610
Let's go up 15.

4580
02:05:56,730 --> 02:05:59,010
So Mitt Romney and his family,

4581
02:05:59,030 --> 02:05:59,460
um,

4582
02:05:59,460 --> 02:06:01,640
they came from this one sec in this,

4583
02:06:01,990 --> 02:06:06,000
they're heavily armed and they fight off
the fucking towel or not the Taliban,

4584
02:06:06,030 --> 02:06:09,690
the drug cartels down there like
they get kidnapped and Shit.

4585
02:06:09,720 --> 02:06:11,850
It's like extreme shit.

4586
02:06:12,090 --> 02:06:13,050
Like the whole,

4587
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:15,570
the whole scene is like really dangerous.

4588
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:16,411
These guys are like,

4589
02:06:16,411 --> 02:06:17,490
they have rifles everywhere.

4590
02:06:17,491 --> 02:06:17,941
They're gone.

4591
02:06:17,941 --> 02:06:18,090
They'll,

4592
02:06:18,090 --> 02:06:21,330
they're always worried the drug
cartels are going to storm the gates.

4593
02:06:21,740 --> 02:06:22,070
It's,

4594
02:06:22,070 --> 02:06:23,160
it's really interesting.

4595
02:06:23,161 --> 02:06:24,550
I believe vice did a piece on it.

4596
02:06:24,551 --> 02:06:25,530
It was it a vice piece.

4597
02:06:25,590 --> 02:06:26,730
See if you find it vice,

4598
02:06:26,731 --> 02:06:27,564
it's pretty damn cool.

4599
02:06:27,620 --> 02:06:27,900
They,

4600
02:06:27,900 --> 02:06:29,400
I think they did a piece on,

4601
02:06:29,401 --> 02:06:31,280
I think that's where I got all the,

4602
02:06:31,281 --> 02:06:31,490
uh,

4603
02:06:31,490 --> 02:06:32,820
the original information from then.

4604
02:06:32,821 --> 02:06:33,930
I just kept looking into it.

4605
02:06:34,020 --> 02:06:34,320
Right.

4606
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:38,340
But Mitt Romney's dad like always wanted
to be president but couldn't because he

4607
02:06:38,341 --> 02:06:39,370
wasn't born in America.

4608
02:06:39,380 --> 02:06:40,110
You're right.

4609
02:06:40,110 --> 02:06:40,831
Like Ted Cruz,

4610
02:06:40,831 --> 02:06:41,251
Ted Cruz,

4611
02:06:41,251 --> 02:06:41,791
born in Canada.

4612
02:06:41,791 --> 02:06:42,001
That.

4613
02:06:42,001 --> 02:06:43,110
Fuck wait,

4614
02:06:43,111 --> 02:06:44,190
but he's running for president.

4615
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:48,000
He's both American and Canadian citizen
because his mother was American,

4616
02:06:48,001 --> 02:06:48,990
but he was born in Canada.

4617
02:06:49,140 --> 02:06:50,280
So like some sort of thing.

4618
02:06:50,281 --> 02:06:51,960
Were you born in a plane?

4619
02:06:51,961 --> 02:06:56,700
Shouldn't be allowed to present
anywhere in Mexican Mormon war.

4620
02:06:56,701 --> 02:06:57,001
Yeah,

4621
02:06:57,001 --> 02:06:57,480
that's it.

4622
02:06:57,480 --> 02:06:58,650
Vice full length.

4623
02:06:58,651 --> 02:06:59,790
Fuck Dude.

4624
02:06:59,940 --> 02:07:00,773
Interesting.

4625
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:01,501
Yeah,

4626
02:07:01,501 --> 02:07:03,830
they're at war apparently with the uh,

4627
02:07:03,930 --> 02:07:07,930
drug cartels down there and they get
kidnapped and all kinds of crazy five-part

4628
02:07:07,950 --> 02:07:08,340
thing.

4629
02:07:08,340 --> 02:07:09,200
Seven part things.

4630
02:07:09,210 --> 02:07:09,900
Jesus full.

4631
02:07:09,900 --> 02:07:11,130
You can watch the full length thing.

4632
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:12,290
I mean the advice doc,

4633
02:07:12,310 --> 02:07:15,150
I mean the warring Mormons
sounds like a great band name.

4634
02:07:16,320 --> 02:07:18,480
The warring Mormons are
playing Coachella next year,

4635
02:07:18,510 --> 02:07:19,650
dorm in war.

4636
02:07:26,670 --> 02:07:28,170
It's like the Mormon Guar.

4637
02:07:28,260 --> 02:07:28,381
Well,

4638
02:07:28,381 --> 02:07:28,841
I think it,

4639
02:07:28,841 --> 02:07:29,790
they were fine.

4640
02:07:29,940 --> 02:07:33,630
Everything was cool until the drug
war came and when the drug war came,

4641
02:07:33,631 --> 02:07:35,190
I think they got,

4642
02:07:35,380 --> 02:07:36,213
they got fucked

4643
02:07:36,460 --> 02:07:36,911
because they're like,

4644
02:07:36,911 --> 02:07:37,091
oh,

4645
02:07:37,091 --> 02:07:41,110
well now this place that we had sort of
decided to live in this super dangerous

4646
02:07:41,530 --> 02:07:42,251
and then we got to go back.

4647
02:07:42,251 --> 02:07:42,670
Yeah.

4648
02:07:42,670 --> 02:07:43,121
I don't know,

4649
02:07:43,121 --> 02:07:43,450
man.

4650
02:07:43,450 --> 02:07:44,141
I don't know what happened.

4651
02:07:44,141 --> 02:07:49,120
I know when when Mitt and his family
decided to come back to good old US event,

4652
02:07:49,420 --> 02:07:50,890
having two wives sounds good.

4653
02:07:51,150 --> 02:07:51,340
You know,

4654
02:07:51,340 --> 02:07:52,810
just have one on each side of the house.

4655
02:07:53,380 --> 02:07:58,120
One week you spend one with one
hape or theory on any theory.

4656
02:07:58,121 --> 02:08:00,850
It's like communism in theory is awesome.

4657
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:01,420
Yeah.

4658
02:08:01,420 --> 02:08:03,580
Cause everyone just does their own thing.

4659
02:08:03,581 --> 02:08:06,100
And then all of the things are
split amongst everyone and like,

4660
02:08:06,101 --> 02:08:06,281
hey,

4661
02:08:06,281 --> 02:08:07,450
you're a doctor and hey,

4662
02:08:07,451 --> 02:08:09,220
you're a mechanic but we're
going to take care of everyone.

4663
02:08:09,230 --> 02:08:09,301
And,

4664
02:08:09,301 --> 02:08:09,481
but the,

4665
02:08:09,481 --> 02:08:10,630
but it sounds great.

4666
02:08:11,040 --> 02:08:13,870
And then you get human beings
into it where it's like,

4667
02:08:13,871 --> 02:08:14,320
okay,

4668
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:17,170
now the doctor who went to 12
years of med school has to be like,

4669
02:08:17,171 --> 02:08:17,441
well wait,

4670
02:08:17,441 --> 02:08:18,910
I'm being paid the same as the mechanic.

4671
02:08:19,010 --> 02:08:19,843
The fuck.

4672
02:08:20,110 --> 02:08:20,801
Well you know what?

4673
02:08:20,801 --> 02:08:21,581
Also to men,

4674
02:08:21,581 --> 02:08:24,550
like whenever someone has any
control over people at all,

4675
02:08:24,551 --> 02:08:26,410
people don't like to be controlled at all.

4676
02:08:26,770 --> 02:08:27,041
And you,

4677
02:08:27,041 --> 02:08:27,401
you know,

4678
02:08:27,401 --> 02:08:31,630
you get one grown adult that
has any control over another
grown adult and people

4679
02:08:31,631 --> 02:08:36,250
resist and it gets ugly telling people
what they can can't do with their

4680
02:08:36,340 --> 02:08:37,960
existence on this planet.

4681
02:08:38,060 --> 02:08:38,410
Right,

4682
02:08:38,410 --> 02:08:38,591
right,

4683
02:08:38,591 --> 02:08:39,040
right.

4684
02:08:39,040 --> 02:08:39,811
I don't want to hear that.

4685
02:08:39,811 --> 02:08:40,210
You,

4686
02:08:40,210 --> 02:08:40,720
you,

4687
02:08:40,720 --> 02:08:42,490
you will be a mechanic.

4688
02:08:42,491 --> 02:08:43,540
You will be a carpenter.

4689
02:08:43,541 --> 02:08:44,410
You will be a tailor.

4690
02:08:44,620 --> 02:08:46,030
That's why Cuba doesn't work.

4691
02:08:46,670 --> 02:08:48,530
Communism doesn't work that way.

4692
02:08:48,660 --> 02:08:50,800
Not like that style of dictator,

4693
02:08:50,860 --> 02:08:51,491
communism,

4694
02:08:51,491 --> 02:08:55,420
dictator driven communism where they
did decide what you're going to do,

4695
02:08:55,421 --> 02:08:56,890
what your occupation is going to be,

4696
02:08:56,891 --> 02:08:59,590
how much you can make
and socialism in general,

4697
02:08:59,591 --> 02:09:01,360
like the idea behind it is beautiful.

4698
02:09:01,540 --> 02:09:02,590
We all contribute.

4699
02:09:02,660 --> 02:09:04,540
We all become a part of this community.

4700
02:09:04,570 --> 02:09:08,050
Meaning in a way you're
small family union.

4701
02:09:08,110 --> 02:09:11,680
You're a small family unit as a
communistic state because you're all like

4702
02:09:11,890 --> 02:09:15,290
helping each other out and you're all
doing your jobs and wife on Sheridan

4703
02:09:15,340 --> 02:09:15,761
together.

4704
02:09:15,761 --> 02:09:16,720
That's very communist,

4705
02:09:16,721 --> 02:09:17,050
right?

4706
02:09:17,050 --> 02:09:17,590
Absolutely.

4707
02:09:17,590 --> 02:09:19,780
Piling all your money
together and sure and then,

4708
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:21,550
but no one's telling the wife like,

4709
02:09:21,551 --> 02:09:23,590
you know some bitch you got to do this.

4710
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:25,993
Yeah,

4711
02:09:26,640 --> 02:09:27,431
this is his rule,

4712
02:09:27,431 --> 02:09:28,540
but I guess you are kind of,

4713
02:09:28,690 --> 02:09:31,720
I wonder if there's going to be any way
that you can test for what you'd be best

4714
02:09:31,721 --> 02:09:32,260
at though.

4715
02:09:32,260 --> 02:09:34,510
Like the website 23 and me,

4716
02:09:34,630 --> 02:09:38,230
it goes through your DNA and it tells
you like if you have the warrior gene,

4717
02:09:38,231 --> 02:09:40,020
if you have like all these certain genes,

4718
02:09:40,090 --> 02:09:40,540
uh,

4719
02:09:40,540 --> 02:09:41,800
if your kids are going to be bald,

4720
02:09:41,801 --> 02:09:43,780
but I wonder if there's ever
going to be a thing where they go,

4721
02:09:43,781 --> 02:09:45,790
you're going to be really
good at math stuff.

4722
02:09:45,790 --> 02:09:47,410
You're going to be really good at it.

4723
02:09:47,430 --> 02:09:48,970
But even if you are really good at it,

4724
02:09:48,971 --> 02:09:51,430
like say like if something comes along
and says you're going to be really good

4725
02:09:51,431 --> 02:09:54,790
at math but you really
want to be a musician,

4726
02:09:55,140 --> 02:09:57,550
like who the fuck is to tell you
that you can't be a musician?

4727
02:09:58,060 --> 02:09:58,960
Dr Ken,

4728
02:09:59,140 --> 02:09:59,970
perfect example.

4729
02:09:59,970 --> 02:10:00,751
Dr Jiang.

4730
02:10:00,751 --> 02:10:01,060
Yeah,

4731
02:10:01,060 --> 02:10:02,520
Ken Jong was a,

4732
02:10:03,070 --> 02:10:03,910
was a doctor.

4733
02:10:04,390 --> 02:10:04,721
Yeah,

4734
02:10:04,721 --> 02:10:08,710
like really recently and go and it's
apparently really good doctor and he's

4735
02:10:08,711 --> 02:10:09,011
like,

4736
02:10:09,011 --> 02:10:09,490
you know,

4737
02:10:09,490 --> 02:10:12,760
I was doing this acting thing and
doing comedy and I like that better.

4738
02:10:12,761 --> 02:10:13,930
I'm making a good living at it.

4739
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:14,793
I'm going to do that instead.

4740
02:10:14,890 --> 02:10:17,290
And he's funny and he's great at that.

4741
02:10:18,340 --> 02:10:21,070
I just think there's a lot of people
would like to do a lot of things like,

4742
02:10:21,071 --> 02:10:23,800
look what if someone told me that I could
either be a cage fighting commentator

4743
02:10:23,801 --> 02:10:24,610
or a comedian,

4744
02:10:24,610 --> 02:10:27,940
I couldn't be bolt
right or have a podcast.

4745
02:10:28,690 --> 02:10:29,260
You know?

4746
02:10:29,260 --> 02:10:31,960
Either you do a podcast or you
know you do something else.

4747
02:10:31,990 --> 02:10:32,410
That's it.

4748
02:10:32,410 --> 02:10:32,951
One or the other.

4749
02:10:32,951 --> 02:10:33,300
I'd be like,

4750
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:34,130
Whoa,

4751
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:36,530
how come park and just do
it all or you can like,

4752
02:10:36,590 --> 02:10:38,600
I got tired of fuck you want to do man,

4753
02:10:38,810 --> 02:10:40,550
that's the beautiful thing.

4754
02:10:40,551 --> 02:10:44,330
One of the most beautiful things about
life is people deciding what they want to

4755
02:10:44,331 --> 02:10:47,000
focus their energy on and then
you see the fruits of their labor.

4756
02:10:47,330 --> 02:10:48,920
Like someone who does murals,

4757
02:10:49,130 --> 02:10:53,360
like they can just decide I want to do
really fucking cool murals or someone who

4758
02:10:53,361 --> 02:10:55,130
makes music or someone who writes books.

4759
02:10:55,131 --> 02:10:59,030
Like you could just decide and when you
got someone telling you what you can and

4760
02:10:59,031 --> 02:10:59,864
can't do,

4761
02:10:59,930 --> 02:11:02,030
that just becomes all fucked up man.

4762
02:11:02,200 --> 02:11:02,361
Yeah,

4763
02:11:02,361 --> 02:11:02,781
it's the,

4764
02:11:02,781 --> 02:11:03,270
it's,

4765
02:11:03,270 --> 02:11:04,580
it's the reverse psychology thing.

4766
02:11:04,610 --> 02:11:05,080
Where are you?

4767
02:11:05,080 --> 02:11:05,751
Where are you almost go?

4768
02:11:05,751 --> 02:11:06,950
Like you want to go against it,

4769
02:11:06,951 --> 02:11:09,710
like even if it makes sense
just because you're like,

4770
02:11:09,740 --> 02:11:10,070
Eh,

4771
02:11:10,070 --> 02:11:11,570
I don't like you telling me to do that.

4772
02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:12,111
Oh yeah,

4773
02:11:12,111 --> 02:11:12,944
man.

4774
02:11:13,130 --> 02:11:13,850
People just,

4775
02:11:13,850 --> 02:11:16,520
it's not a natural aspect of,

4776
02:11:16,790 --> 02:11:18,380
for some people it's natural.

4777
02:11:19,170 --> 02:11:21,110
Some people enjoy being told what to do.

4778
02:11:21,380 --> 02:11:23,330
Some people guidance in their life,

4779
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:23,810
they,

4780
02:11:23,810 --> 02:11:24,643
they like it.

4781
02:11:24,710 --> 02:11:27,020
And then there's also some people
that like being ordered around,

4782
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:29,210
there's like dominant
and submissive people,

4783
02:11:29,390 --> 02:11:30,500
his people that enjoy that.

4784
02:11:30,501 --> 02:11:32,810
And there's nothing wrong with
that either makes you happy.

4785
02:11:32,880 --> 02:11:33,201
That's fine.

4786
02:11:33,201 --> 02:11:34,310
Freedom man.

4787
02:11:34,311 --> 02:11:39,020
Freedom to be submissive is just as much
of a freedom is the freedom to be free.

4788
02:11:39,240 --> 02:11:39,560
You know,

4789
02:11:39,560 --> 02:11:41,150
freedom to be an artist.

4790
02:11:41,151 --> 02:11:42,350
Freedom to be a doctor,

4791
02:11:42,351 --> 02:11:45,890
which fucking let people
figure out what their thing is.

4792
02:11:46,130 --> 02:11:47,180
He didn't from families,

4793
02:11:47,181 --> 02:11:47,690
man.

4794
02:11:47,690 --> 02:11:47,871
I mean,

4795
02:11:47,871 --> 02:11:52,871
how many fucking people like I know
a dude and his family disowned him.

4796
02:11:53,750 --> 02:11:54,080
No,

4797
02:11:54,080 --> 02:11:54,500
no,

4798
02:11:54,500 --> 02:11:55,130
I'm sorry.

4799
02:11:55,130 --> 02:12:00,130
His family disowned his sister because
his sister didn't marry a doctor.

4800
02:12:01,900 --> 02:12:03,650
He's the dad.

4801
02:12:03,651 --> 02:12:08,420
Put the girl through nursing school with
the hopes that the girl would marry a

4802
02:12:08,421 --> 02:12:09,790
doctor now and she'll,

4803
02:12:09,800 --> 02:12:11,850
she can be a nurse just so she can marry.

4804
02:12:11,890 --> 02:12:13,040
So she's going to marry a doctor,

4805
02:12:13,060 --> 02:12:17,340
like dad's of total piece of Shit
and the dad disowned her and uh,

4806
02:12:17,390 --> 02:12:19,710
because she married some fucking
mechanic or something like that,

4807
02:12:19,711 --> 02:12:21,050
she fell in love with some regular dude.

4808
02:12:22,640 --> 02:12:23,211
This is,

4809
02:12:23,211 --> 02:12:26,360
the world is filled with
stories like that for awhile.

4810
02:12:26,530 --> 02:12:27,050
Uh,

4811
02:12:27,050 --> 02:12:30,650
my parents told me that I could only
marry a dwarf because any tall woman would

4812
02:12:30,651 --> 02:12:35,600
only want me for either a sick fetish or
for fame or for money or something like

4813
02:12:35,601 --> 02:12:36,434
that.

4814
02:12:36,910 --> 02:12:37,210
I mean,

4815
02:12:37,210 --> 02:12:37,430
they,

4816
02:12:37,430 --> 02:12:37,910
they've,

4817
02:12:37,910 --> 02:12:38,211
they,

4818
02:12:38,211 --> 02:12:39,500
they've since changed their tune.

4819
02:12:39,590 --> 02:12:40,423
But uh,

4820
02:12:40,550 --> 02:12:43,370
did you bring up Peter Dinklage
she's got a regular size gal.

4821
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:44,270
Yes he does.

4822
02:12:44,360 --> 02:12:45,110
And uh,

4823
02:12:45,110 --> 02:12:45,260
no.

4824
02:12:45,260 --> 02:12:45,700
They like,

4825
02:12:45,700 --> 02:12:45,831
okay.

4826
02:12:45,831 --> 02:12:46,840
You said that was the eyebrow raise

4827
02:12:48,660 --> 02:12:49,730
like the tall women.

4828
02:12:49,940 --> 02:12:50,540
I like him.

4829
02:12:50,540 --> 02:12:51,141
Why not man?

4830
02:12:51,141 --> 02:12:52,580
If they like you all right,

4831
02:12:52,670 --> 02:12:53,061
why not?

4832
02:12:53,061 --> 02:12:55,460
And that and like I have
shelves in my house.

4833
02:12:55,460 --> 02:12:56,630
I would love to get used.

4834
02:12:56,890 --> 02:12:57,200
Yeah,

4835
02:12:57,200 --> 02:12:58,033
get up there.

4836
02:12:58,220 --> 02:12:59,240
I'm using ladders.

4837
02:12:59,330 --> 02:12:59,991
Exactly.

4838
02:12:59,991 --> 02:13:03,960
I would love to put things up
at the fancy plates tonight.

4839
02:13:04,540 --> 02:13:04,941
Waiting enough,

4840
02:13:04,941 --> 02:13:07,150
the fine China Sea,

4841
02:13:07,250 --> 02:13:08,960
those baked beans at the top shelf,

4842
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:10,033
go grab them.

4843
02:13:11,240 --> 02:13:12,770
That I'm missing that.

4844
02:13:13,010 --> 02:13:15,530
Like that's like that's dwarf porn.

4845
02:13:15,860 --> 02:13:20,420
Dwarf porn is just watching people
reach shit and you're just sitting there

4846
02:13:20,421 --> 02:13:20,840
like,

4847
02:13:20,840 --> 02:13:21,321
Oh God,

4848
02:13:21,321 --> 02:13:22,340
I want to do that one day.

4849
02:13:22,700 --> 02:13:27,650
That's so do you worry like as a standup
that there's going to be a certain

4850
02:13:27,651 --> 02:13:30,200
amount of like dwarf
jokes that way you'll,

4851
02:13:30,230 --> 02:13:31,680
you'll hit like a wall.

4852
02:13:32,610 --> 02:13:33,420
Yeah,

4853
02:13:33,420 --> 02:13:33,870
I do.

4854
02:13:33,870 --> 02:13:34,320
I mean,

4855
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:35,160
but the thing is,

4856
02:13:35,200 --> 02:13:36,540
is this your first special?

4857
02:13:36,660 --> 02:13:36,931
Yes.

4858
02:13:36,931 --> 02:13:38,100
This is my first hour special.

4859
02:13:38,101 --> 02:13:38,760
I've had,

4860
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:41,040
I have two albums out and a,

4861
02:13:41,041 --> 02:13:44,940
and then this is the third special or the
third hour that's being put out there.

4862
02:13:44,941 --> 02:13:45,900
What are the album's out,

4863
02:13:45,930 --> 02:13:46,170
uh,

4864
02:13:46,170 --> 02:13:46,790
called?

4865
02:13:46,790 --> 02:13:47,300
Uh,

4866
02:13:47,300 --> 02:13:47,491
got them.

4867
02:13:47,491 --> 02:13:50,310
If you want to get them on iTunes.

4868
02:13:50,340 --> 02:13:52,200
They're called Brad
Williams coming up short.

4869
02:13:52,230 --> 02:13:55,500
And then the second album
is called High Ho and uh,

4870
02:13:55,620 --> 02:13:55,861
yeah.

4871
02:13:55,861 --> 02:13:57,870
And they're available on iTunes
are available on my website.

4872
02:13:58,230 --> 02:14:00,200
[inaudible] dot com if you
weren't from my website,

4873
02:14:00,240 --> 02:14:01,620
I'll sign them and send them to you.

4874
02:14:01,980 --> 02:14:02,813
Oh,

4875
02:14:02,970 --> 02:14:03,421
look at that.

4876
02:14:03,421 --> 02:14:04,650
It's worth about 5 cents more.

4877
02:14:06,030 --> 02:14:06,690
Uh,

4878
02:14:06,690 --> 02:14:07,190
so yeah,

4879
02:14:07,190 --> 02:14:07,750
and,

4880
02:14:07,750 --> 02:14:09,210
and but the thing is,

4881
02:14:09,211 --> 02:14:14,211
is that like my jokes are always going
to have a little person perspective

4882
02:14:16,470 --> 02:14:19,560
because I don't know how
to write any other way.

4883
02:14:19,590 --> 02:14:22,110
They're not necessarily
going to be dwarf jokes.

4884
02:14:22,111 --> 02:14:22,381
Like,

4885
02:14:22,381 --> 02:14:22,651
Hey,

4886
02:14:22,651 --> 02:14:23,630
I can like,

4887
02:14:23,890 --> 02:14:25,590
like isn't this weird?

4888
02:14:25,591 --> 02:14:27,360
I wear this size shirt
or whatever the fuck.

4889
02:14:27,510 --> 02:14:32,510
Like it's not going to be w w I always
use this example that a guy told me to

4890
02:14:32,701 --> 02:14:33,441
say on stage.

4891
02:14:33,441 --> 02:14:33,691
He's like,

4892
02:14:33,691 --> 02:14:34,800
I wrote a joke for you.

4893
02:14:34,920 --> 02:14:35,131
I was like,

4894
02:14:35,131 --> 02:14:35,521
what's that?

4895
02:14:35,521 --> 02:14:36,180
He goes,

4896
02:14:36,180 --> 02:14:38,730
you go on stage and say you
can take a bath in a thimble.

4897
02:14:38,731 --> 02:14:40,020
It's going to be hilarious.

4898
02:14:40,230 --> 02:14:40,950
And I was like,

4899
02:14:40,950 --> 02:14:41,580
all right,

4900
02:14:41,580 --> 02:14:42,370
thanks.

4901
02:14:42,370 --> 02:14:43,230
Oh good.

4902
02:14:44,210 --> 02:14:44,880
So,

4903
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:45,500
so that,

4904
02:14:45,500 --> 02:14:50,010
that's like my example of like the
chief of like the cheesy dwarf joke.

4905
02:14:50,350 --> 02:14:51,183
Um,

4906
02:14:51,240 --> 02:14:52,290
but no matter what I do,

4907
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:53,550
no matter what I experienced,

4908
02:14:53,551 --> 02:14:56,430
it's always going to be through that
perspective simply because I don't know

4909
02:14:56,431 --> 02:14:57,210
what it's like.

4910
02:14:57,210 --> 02:15:01,020
If it's that different to
experience things for through the,

4911
02:15:01,980 --> 02:15:03,300
through the eyes of a five foot eight guy.

4912
02:15:03,330 --> 02:15:04,380
I don't know.

4913
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:05,610
I'm not familiar with it.

4914
02:15:05,970 --> 02:15:06,391
I don't know.

4915
02:15:06,391 --> 02:15:07,350
I don't know if it's different.

4916
02:15:07,351 --> 02:15:08,460
It might be exactly the same.

4917
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:11,320
Do you think that you'll ever get to
a point where it just doesn't even,

4918
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:12,050
we get addressed,

4919
02:15:12,050 --> 02:15:14,120
like say if you become a
famous comic and you're,

4920
02:15:14,121 --> 02:15:14,420
you know,

4921
02:15:14,420 --> 02:15:15,950
20 years in and you're,

4922
02:15:15,951 --> 02:15:16,231
you know,

4923
02:15:16,231 --> 02:15:18,320
doing specials on a regular basis,

4924
02:15:18,321 --> 02:15:18,801
like every two,

4925
02:15:18,801 --> 02:15:19,341
three years,

4926
02:15:19,341 --> 02:15:20,300
everybody knows who you are.

4927
02:15:20,301 --> 02:15:21,260
Everybody knows what you do.

4928
02:15:21,610 --> 02:15:22,040
I will,

4929
02:15:22,040 --> 02:15:22,873
I will.

4930
02:15:22,890 --> 02:15:24,910
I would imagine because it,

4931
02:15:24,940 --> 02:15:29,460
because right now it's at a point where
when I go on stage I have to talk about

4932
02:15:29,461 --> 02:15:30,630
it cause the entire audience is like,

4933
02:15:30,631 --> 02:15:32,220
Yo what's this?

4934
02:15:32,280 --> 02:15:32,970
What's,

4935
02:15:32,970 --> 02:15:33,900
what's up with this?

4936
02:15:34,200 --> 02:15:34,560
I got,

4937
02:15:34,560 --> 02:15:37,050
I got to know cause people aren't
that familiar with little people.

4938
02:15:37,130 --> 02:15:37,540
Right.

4939
02:15:37,540 --> 02:15:41,340
It's an experience that a lot of
people aren't necessarily and the,

4940
02:15:41,341 --> 02:15:45,360
and there's a lot of nuances to it that
some people just aren't quite aware of.

4941
02:15:45,570 --> 02:15:46,111
So,

4942
02:15:46,111 --> 02:15:47,010
and they have a lot of questions.

4943
02:15:47,011 --> 02:15:49,260
So I go on stage and I
addressed those questions.

4944
02:15:49,550 --> 02:15:50,130
Uh,

4945
02:15:50,130 --> 02:15:52,470
but I don't want you to
think that my entire act,

4946
02:15:52,471 --> 02:15:53,610
it's just like 12 joke.

4947
02:15:54,310 --> 02:15:54,830
No.

4948
02:15:54,830 --> 02:15:56,400
Like I go into an out,

4949
02:15:56,430 --> 02:15:56,800
right.

4950
02:15:56,800 --> 02:15:56,940
Yeah.

4951
02:15:56,940 --> 02:15:57,840
And there's only,

4952
02:15:58,230 --> 02:15:59,340
there's only so many things that,

4953
02:15:59,580 --> 02:16:00,090
that,

4954
02:16:00,090 --> 02:16:02,370
that you can cover right now,

4955
02:16:02,580 --> 02:16:03,091
uh,

4956
02:16:03,091 --> 02:16:05,370
in the new hour them try it
that I'm trying to get together.

4957
02:16:05,400 --> 02:16:07,560
A lot of the jokes are just like,

4958
02:16:07,561 --> 02:16:09,480
this is what my life is like.

4959
02:16:09,510 --> 02:16:13,110
These are the stories that happened
to me that are weird as fuck that you

4960
02:16:13,111 --> 02:16:16,830
wouldn't need that you're advertise person
wouldn't even consider and you don't

4961
02:16:16,831 --> 02:16:17,664
think about.

4962
02:16:17,700 --> 02:16:19,410
And it's not necessarily like,

4963
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:19,740
ah,

4964
02:16:19,740 --> 02:16:20,820
if I fall off a curb,

4965
02:16:20,821 --> 02:16:21,481
it's a long way,

4966
02:16:21,481 --> 02:16:22,020
man.

4967
02:16:22,020 --> 02:16:22,291
You know,

4968
02:16:22,291 --> 02:16:23,250
it's not like that.

4969
02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:28,380
It's just like when a dude got
like when I won't do the joke,

4970
02:16:28,381 --> 02:16:29,590
but like a guy,

4971
02:16:29,591 --> 02:16:33,460
I got into a car accident with a guy
and he got out and when he saw me,

4972
02:16:33,461 --> 02:16:35,740
he didn't give a fuck
about the car accident.

4973
02:16:35,830 --> 02:16:36,460
He was just like,

4974
02:16:36,460 --> 02:16:37,280
whoa.

4975
02:16:37,280 --> 02:16:38,020
All right,

4976
02:16:38,020 --> 02:16:38,950
let's talk about this.

4977
02:16:39,160 --> 02:16:41,840
And he started asking me
questions like about being a norm.

4978
02:16:42,100 --> 02:16:44,400
Was that a normal thing
for you that happened?

4979
02:16:44,420 --> 02:16:44,860
Yeah.

4980
02:16:44,860 --> 02:16:46,810
Like people have that uncomfortable.

4981
02:16:46,900 --> 02:16:47,860
You didn't know him?

4982
02:16:47,950 --> 02:16:50,500
The fact that he wasn't angry about
the fact that I fucked up his car,

4983
02:16:50,501 --> 02:16:50,801
I was like,

4984
02:16:50,801 --> 02:16:51,850
whatever you hit him.

4985
02:16:51,880 --> 02:16:52,060
Oh,

4986
02:16:52,060 --> 02:16:52,893
it was totally my fault.

4987
02:16:52,900 --> 02:16:54,270
I was texting while driving like,

4988
02:16:54,290 --> 02:16:55,690
oh fucking idiot.

4989
02:16:56,080 --> 02:16:56,801
Never do that.

4990
02:16:56,801 --> 02:16:57,760
People my fault.

4991
02:16:58,090 --> 02:16:58,750
Um,

4992
02:16:58,750 --> 02:16:59,171
so yeah,

4993
02:16:59,171 --> 02:17:00,010
I wrecked his car.

4994
02:17:00,280 --> 02:17:01,420
Like he didn't care.

4995
02:17:01,660 --> 02:17:01,961
He's like,

4996
02:17:01,961 --> 02:17:02,321
dude,

4997
02:17:02,321 --> 02:17:03,131
this is awesome.

4998
02:17:03,131 --> 02:17:05,020
Like you just start talking to
me about being a little person.

4999
02:17:05,021 --> 02:17:05,201
I'm like,

5000
02:17:05,201 --> 02:17:05,650
whatever.

5001
02:17:05,650 --> 02:17:06,880
Whatever distracts you wrote,

5002
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:07,833
it's fine.

5003
02:17:08,150 --> 02:17:08,930
Just showed up.

5004
02:17:08,930 --> 02:17:09,331
Yeah.

5005
02:17:09,331 --> 02:17:13,730
Like bizarre phone books taped to
your pedals and stuff like that.

5006
02:17:13,731 --> 02:17:15,490
I have a pedal extenders,

5007
02:17:15,950 --> 02:17:17,020
so it's kind of close.

5008
02:17:17,021 --> 02:17:22,021
So it's like metal rods that you put
on at you attach and then you put that,

5009
02:17:23,321 --> 02:17:24,400
have a pedal on top of it.

5010
02:17:24,430 --> 02:17:24,821
Brian,

5011
02:17:24,821 --> 02:17:26,500
don't you remember that
dude who drove us around?

5012
02:17:26,910 --> 02:17:27,743
Oh yeah.

5013
02:17:27,760 --> 02:17:28,593
In Texas.

5014
02:17:29,080 --> 02:17:29,621
No arm.

5015
02:17:29,621 --> 02:17:30,670
He had no arms,

5016
02:17:30,850 --> 02:17:33,360
no legs heal nubs arms.

5017
02:17:33,370 --> 02:17:34,420
And he drove us around.

5018
02:17:34,450 --> 02:17:37,310
We had a car and hand
controls or watch video of,

5019
02:17:37,311 --> 02:17:37,420
yeah,

5020
02:17:37,420 --> 02:17:37,900
we have video.

5021
02:17:37,900 --> 02:17:40,620
Just show 10 and I believe
has that available.

5022
02:17:40,621 --> 02:17:42,130
Can you people on Youtube?

5023
02:17:42,131 --> 02:17:42,400
Yeah.

5024
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:43,080
Wow.

5025
02:17:43,080 --> 02:17:43,330
Yeah.

5026
02:17:43,330 --> 02:17:44,350
See if you can find that Jamie.

5027
02:17:44,351 --> 02:17:45,184
We'll end with that.

5028
02:17:45,190 --> 02:17:45,521
But yeah,

5029
02:17:45,521 --> 02:17:45,850
he's,

5030
02:17:45,850 --> 02:17:50,850
he drives around with his elbows and he
was like spinning the steering wheel and

5031
02:17:51,290 --> 02:17:52,990
says the is the mother of invention.

5032
02:17:53,290 --> 02:17:54,040
Yeah.

5033
02:17:54,040 --> 02:17:54,760
There was a trip.

5034
02:17:54,760 --> 02:17:55,790
It was a really good dude.

5035
02:17:55,791 --> 02:17:56,740
And he was drunk,

5036
02:17:56,741 --> 02:17:57,574
I think.

5037
02:17:58,530 --> 02:17:59,530
I don't know if he was drunk.

5038
02:17:59,531 --> 02:18:01,470
I didn't breathalyze them there.

5039
02:18:01,730 --> 02:18:02,490
I'll look at that.

5040
02:18:02,490 --> 02:18:02,620
Yeah,

5041
02:18:02,620 --> 02:18:03,341
he's got the nubs.

5042
02:18:03,341 --> 02:18:04,390
I forgot about him.

5043
02:18:04,391 --> 02:18:05,224
That was

5044
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:08,710
his defense.

5045
02:18:09,130 --> 02:18:09,700
Yeah.

5046
02:18:09,700 --> 02:18:10,630
He just slips out of it.

5047
02:18:10,660 --> 02:18:11,021
Yeah.

5048
02:18:11,021 --> 02:18:11,501
And uh,

5049
02:18:11,501 --> 02:18:12,940
this guy drives around.

5050
02:18:12,941 --> 02:18:14,350
He drives us around in his van.

5051
02:18:14,390 --> 02:18:15,390
Wow.

5052
02:18:15,910 --> 02:18:18,850
There's a part where it right after
here where he actually shows up driving,

5053
02:18:18,851 --> 02:18:19,570
I think.

5054
02:18:19,570 --> 02:18:20,380
Wow.

5055
02:18:20,380 --> 02:18:21,213
Yeah.

5056
02:18:21,700 --> 02:18:22,900
And then his other friend,

5057
02:18:23,470 --> 02:18:24,670
what was the weapon with his other friend?

5058
02:18:24,910 --> 02:18:26,530
His other friend was paralyzed.

5059
02:18:26,531 --> 02:18:30,310
He was in a wheelchair and he was
heckling and he wouldn't stop heckling.

5060
02:18:30,311 --> 02:18:33,580
So I taught a girl who's in the
front row with them how to choke them

5061
02:18:33,581 --> 02:18:34,414
unconscious.

5062
02:18:34,760 --> 02:18:37,290
So she choked the dude out calls.

5063
02:18:37,310 --> 02:18:38,470
Is it a cap city?

5064
02:18:38,620 --> 02:18:39,120
Yeah,

5065
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:39,430
absolutely.

5066
02:18:39,430 --> 02:18:40,220
Comic Club in Austin.

5067
02:18:40,220 --> 02:18:40,620
Yeah.

5068
02:18:40,620 --> 02:18:41,210
Yeah.

5069
02:18:41,210 --> 02:18:41,960
I,

5070
02:18:41,960 --> 02:18:43,150
I recorded my first album that,

5071
02:18:43,151 --> 02:18:44,120
that place is awesome,

5072
02:18:44,220 --> 02:18:45,053
man.

5073
02:18:45,230 --> 02:18:46,080
Kid Park.

5074
02:18:58,090 --> 02:18:59,700
So is this the guy with no arms recycling?

5075
02:19:00,280 --> 02:19:00,581
Yeah,

5076
02:19:00,581 --> 02:19:00,911
no,

5077
02:19:00,911 --> 02:19:01,900
this is his friend.

5078
02:19:02,570 --> 02:19:03,130
I Adam,

5079
02:19:03,130 --> 02:19:03,491
shut off.

5080
02:19:03,491 --> 02:19:04,450
The only way I can think of,

5081
02:19:04,451 --> 02:19:06,280
I talked to his friends
in the trophy room,

5082
02:19:06,290 --> 02:19:11,290
unconscious was with him and I said
to her how she could get him to take a

5083
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:12,753
choke,

5084
02:19:20,740 --> 02:19:21,573
choke him out.

5085
02:19:22,060 --> 02:19:22,893
Well,

5086
02:19:23,110 --> 02:19:23,351
yeah,

5087
02:19:23,351 --> 02:19:24,250
she eventually did.

5088
02:19:26,280 --> 02:19:27,113
When you left.

5089
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:28,701
I coaxed.

5090
02:19:28,701 --> 02:19:29,181
It's ruined.

5091
02:19:29,181 --> 02:19:30,014
Yeah.

5092
02:19:30,570 --> 02:19:31,430
Kind of all about this.

5093
02:19:50,330 --> 02:19:51,730
You right or left,

5094
02:19:54,340 --> 02:19:55,980
squeeze that mother fucker.

5095
02:20:02,230 --> 02:20:02,951
You know,

5096
02:20:02,951 --> 02:20:07,120
you have to be ruining his show and
the audience is encouraging to lose

5097
02:20:07,121 --> 02:20:07,790
consciousness.

5098
02:20:07,790 --> 02:20:10,690
A woman who just showed her tits to choke,

5099
02:20:10,810 --> 02:20:13,390
a man who's in a wheelchair unconscious,

5100
02:20:15,780 --> 02:20:16,650
she put him out.

5101
02:20:20,650 --> 02:20:21,483
That's hilarious.

5102
02:20:21,510 --> 02:20:24,090
You're lucky that dude
didn't die like sue the shit

5103
02:20:28,750 --> 02:20:29,830
that they're looking at us.

5104
02:20:30,630 --> 02:20:31,463
He says,

5105
02:20:35,300 --> 02:20:35,601
yeah,

5106
02:20:35,601 --> 02:20:38,120
it was a valet gonna
utilize that equipment.

5107
02:20:38,140 --> 02:20:38,931
Oh Belize.

5108
02:20:38,931 --> 02:20:39,764
Fucking hate me.

5109
02:20:39,890 --> 02:20:40,820
It was fun man.

5110
02:20:41,990 --> 02:20:42,411
And Yeah.

5111
02:20:42,411 --> 02:20:43,700
Would you valet your car?

5112
02:20:43,720 --> 02:20:44,210
No.

5113
02:20:44,210 --> 02:20:46,310
Like I like I pull up and I just go,

5114
02:20:46,311 --> 02:20:46,910
dude,

5115
02:20:46,910 --> 02:20:47,743
let me do it.

5116
02:20:49,490 --> 02:20:49,851
Yeah,

5117
02:20:49,851 --> 02:20:50,481
I would imagine.

5118
02:20:50,481 --> 02:20:50,740
Right?

5119
02:20:50,740 --> 02:20:53,420
Like they probably would have
to have her knees up way high.

5120
02:20:53,421 --> 02:20:53,601
Yeah,

5121
02:20:53,601 --> 02:20:53,831
yeah,

5122
02:20:53,831 --> 02:20:54,141
yeah.

5123
02:20:54,141 --> 02:20:56,000
Cause like I've got my car,

5124
02:20:56,001 --> 02:20:59,810
I've got my seat at the perfect spot where
I can see the mirror steering wheels.

5125
02:20:59,811 --> 02:21:00,051
Good.

5126
02:21:00,051 --> 02:21:00,861
I can reach everything.

5127
02:21:00,861 --> 02:21:01,400
It's good.

5128
02:21:01,400 --> 02:21:03,290
And then the valley gets it
and they just fuck it up.

5129
02:21:03,291 --> 02:21:03,740
So I,

5130
02:21:03,740 --> 02:21:04,451
so I just tell him,

5131
02:21:04,451 --> 02:21:04,611
Hey,

5132
02:21:04,611 --> 02:21:05,670
I'll pay the valet fee.

5133
02:21:05,690 --> 02:21:06,890
Just let me park it.

5134
02:21:07,220 --> 02:21:07,791
I'll come out.

5135
02:21:07,791 --> 02:21:09,050
Like just do that.

5136
02:21:09,100 --> 02:21:12,200
Or there's certain cars you can
use and certain cars you can't use,

5137
02:21:12,201 --> 02:21:14,420
like certain cars you
can't adjust properly.

5138
02:21:14,630 --> 02:21:15,740
Like the car I have right now,

5139
02:21:15,741 --> 02:21:17,240
I've got a Lexus CT,

5140
02:21:17,241 --> 02:21:18,830
which is a little hatchback hybrid.

5141
02:21:19,190 --> 02:21:20,023
And uh,

5142
02:21:20,030 --> 02:21:21,320
I didn't have to do too much to it.

5143
02:21:21,321 --> 02:21:25,970
I got Pedalec senators on that that were
very small and then the seat moves up a

5144
02:21:25,971 --> 02:21:26,181
lot.

5145
02:21:26,181 --> 02:21:28,820
But also their steering wheel extends out.

5146
02:21:29,030 --> 02:21:29,300
Uh,

5147
02:21:29,300 --> 02:21:30,170
so I,

5148
02:21:30,230 --> 02:21:31,610
my arms are good cause my arms are small.

5149
02:21:31,611 --> 02:21:32,450
But uh,

5150
02:21:32,451 --> 02:21:33,710
yes I was able to grab the steering wheel.

5151
02:21:33,711 --> 02:21:36,350
I can drive that thing with
not too much modification.

5152
02:21:36,351 --> 02:21:40,280
The only thing I had to do was I also
had to pop the air bag because I'm really

5153
02:21:40,281 --> 02:21:41,480
close to the steering wheel.

5154
02:21:41,690 --> 02:21:42,160
So if that,

5155
02:21:42,160 --> 02:21:44,060
so if that airbag goes off,

5156
02:21:44,440 --> 02:21:45,290
it takes your head off.

5157
02:21:45,291 --> 02:21:45,561
Yeah,

5158
02:21:45,561 --> 02:21:46,310
I'm gone.

5159
02:21:46,310 --> 02:21:48,740
You ever seen people's faces and
they get hit with that airbag?

5160
02:21:49,090 --> 02:21:53,300
The airbag fucking looks like give you
some black ice and it looks like they got

5161
02:21:53,301 --> 02:21:54,380
hit with a waffle iron.

5162
02:21:54,381 --> 02:21:56,300
They had like those lines on their face.

5163
02:21:56,910 --> 02:21:58,100
A good way to put it.

5164
02:21:58,160 --> 02:21:58,750
Yeah.

5165
02:21:58,750 --> 02:21:59,330
And,

5166
02:21:59,330 --> 02:22:00,830
and I got to list to you,

5167
02:22:00,890 --> 02:22:01,700
uh,

5168
02:22:01,700 --> 02:22:03,290
based on watching that video.

5169
02:22:03,590 --> 02:22:04,040
Uh,

5170
02:22:04,040 --> 02:22:04,610
thank you.

5171
02:22:04,610 --> 02:22:07,790
Because you treated that guy
and his friend like an equal.

5172
02:22:08,160 --> 02:22:08,420
You,

5173
02:22:08,420 --> 02:22:08,650
you,

5174
02:22:08,650 --> 02:22:09,141
you're just like,

5175
02:22:09,141 --> 02:22:09,411
no,

5176
02:22:09,411 --> 02:22:10,191
you're in the front row.

5177
02:22:10,191 --> 02:22:11,150
You're your buddy's heckling.

5178
02:22:11,151 --> 02:22:12,170
I don't care that you got no arms.

5179
02:22:12,200 --> 02:22:17,200
Well there was 300 other people in the
show that he was ruining it for people

5180
02:22:17,290 --> 02:22:18,650
that have to deal with and you,

5181
02:22:18,651 --> 02:22:20,570
and we could all agree on this.

5182
02:22:20,900 --> 02:22:23,600
When you're doing a show
and someone is heckling you,

5183
02:22:23,601 --> 02:22:24,830
it's not just you,

5184
02:22:24,831 --> 02:22:25,980
this person's fucking it

5185
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:26,611
up for you.

5186
02:22:26,611 --> 02:22:28,680
They're fucking up for the whole room.

5187
02:22:28,920 --> 02:22:31,170
That's why everybody gets angry at them.

5188
02:22:31,560 --> 02:22:33,330
It's like people don't understand that.

5189
02:22:33,360 --> 02:22:36,660
Like there's this thing like
you're trying to put on a show.

5190
02:22:36,810 --> 02:22:36,970
Yeah.

5191
02:22:36,970 --> 02:22:38,760
When someone jumps in like that,

5192
02:22:38,761 --> 02:22:41,650
like that person needs to
be stopped at all costs.

5193
02:22:41,651 --> 02:22:41,980
Yeah.

5194
02:22:41,980 --> 02:22:43,590
I like when I get a heckler.

5195
02:22:43,970 --> 02:22:45,180
It's why I like,

5196
02:22:45,300 --> 02:22:49,830
some people say when a comic would go
on stage and they get a heckler and then

5197
02:22:49,831 --> 02:22:50,820
they get like,

5198
02:22:50,821 --> 02:22:50,971
oh,

5199
02:22:50,971 --> 02:22:55,971
but this woman was heckling him and then
he said that she should go get raped by

5200
02:22:56,041 --> 02:22:56,940
a thousand Dick's.

5201
02:22:56,941 --> 02:23:00,300
It's like he's not thinking or she's not
thinking what's politically correct at

5202
02:23:00,301 --> 02:23:00,840
that moment.

5203
02:23:00,840 --> 02:23:03,030
You're only thought is shut the fuck up

5204
02:23:04,540 --> 02:23:08,010
as hilarious and also reflect
the attitude of the room.

5205
02:23:08,140 --> 02:23:08,520
Right?

5206
02:23:08,520 --> 02:23:09,091
Because the room,

5207
02:23:09,091 --> 02:23:10,380
they're fucking angry.

5208
02:23:11,110 --> 02:23:12,540
They want to say something like that,

5209
02:23:12,541 --> 02:23:13,250
but they can't.

5210
02:23:13,250 --> 02:23:13,670
Right.

5211
02:23:13,670 --> 02:23:14,630
So you're the voice of that.

5212
02:23:14,631 --> 02:23:14,790
Yeah,

5213
02:23:14,790 --> 02:23:17,070
they're 1520 rows back and if you say,

5214
02:23:17,071 --> 02:23:18,750
I hope you get raped by a thousand decks,

5215
02:23:20,550 --> 02:23:21,990
they don't really think that.

5216
02:23:22,430 --> 02:23:22,840
No,

5217
02:23:22,840 --> 02:23:25,860
but that's when you violate the agreement.

5218
02:23:25,890 --> 02:23:27,970
The agreement is I to come to a show.

5219
02:23:28,530 --> 02:23:28,861
Yeah,

5220
02:23:28,861 --> 02:23:29,311
that's it.

5221
02:23:29,311 --> 02:23:30,031
That's the agreement.

5222
02:23:30,031 --> 02:23:30,451
You come,

5223
02:23:30,451 --> 02:23:31,410
you're an audience member.

5224
02:23:31,411 --> 02:23:35,220
You're not a part of the show and not
interrupting bits that are planned out in

5225
02:23:35,221 --> 02:23:35,980
advance.

5226
02:23:35,980 --> 02:23:38,760
You're interrupting time and
you're making it all about you.

5227
02:23:38,761 --> 02:23:39,900
You're a selfish fuck.

5228
02:23:40,180 --> 02:23:41,820
And I hate that excuse of well,

5229
02:23:41,821 --> 02:23:44,380
you should be a professional
party at his job.

5230
02:23:44,490 --> 02:23:45,323
That is part of the job,

5231
02:23:45,630 --> 02:23:46,980
the job fuck up.

5232
02:23:47,250 --> 02:23:48,530
That is part of the jostle.

5233
02:23:48,660 --> 02:23:52,320
But the idea that you should
be a professional meaning
that like this is like

5234
02:23:52,780 --> 02:23:55,900
you should just deal with it and
you shouldn't say anything mean yes,

5235
02:23:56,010 --> 02:23:57,720
but without saying anything controversial,

5236
02:23:58,120 --> 02:24:00,360
you don't even know what this job is.

5237
02:24:00,780 --> 02:24:01,800
You have no idea.

5238
02:24:01,840 --> 02:24:04,710
I think that just because they
paid money to come see you,

5239
02:24:04,711 --> 02:24:06,570
they can sort of dictate how you do it.

5240
02:24:06,750 --> 02:24:06,871
Well,

5241
02:24:06,871 --> 02:24:07,021
yeah,

5242
02:24:07,021 --> 02:24:08,940
it's the same way with the
same way with the movies.

5243
02:24:08,941 --> 02:24:10,590
I paid money to see this x men movie.

5244
02:24:10,620 --> 02:24:12,060
It must be to my liking.

5245
02:24:12,840 --> 02:24:14,730
Cyclops is wearing the wrong outfit.

5246
02:24:15,090 --> 02:24:15,923
Cons,

5247
02:24:16,860 --> 02:24:17,980
