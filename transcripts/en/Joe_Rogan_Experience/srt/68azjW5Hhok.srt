1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,680
Four three,
two,

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,190
one dude.

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:13,843
First of all,
what possessed you to want to swim 

4
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,510
around the entire UK?
How many thousands of miles is that?

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,560
Yeah.
Uh,

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,820
2000 miles altogether.
2000 miles of swimming.

7
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:26,960
Yeah.
Yeah.

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,063
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
And then half way round I realized how 

9
00:00:30,471 --> 00:00:32,150
big Great Britain was.
You,

10
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:35,000
you've done some long swims before,

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,493
but

12
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:37,683
not like nothing even remotely.
Like what's the longest swim you did 

13
00:00:40,361 --> 00:00:41,680
before this?
I did.

14
00:00:41,681 --> 00:00:42,140
Um,
oh,

15
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,510
this is a bit of a strange story.
I did.

16
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:44,344
Um,
I tried to swim between Saint Lucia 

17
00:00:45,821 --> 00:00:48,240
Martinique to Caribbean islands.
Um,

18
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,140
it's only 40 kilometers from point to 
point.

19
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,670
And,
and for charity,

20
00:00:51,671 --> 00:00:52,504
I was trying to swim from point to point
with 100 pound tree attached to my 

21
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:57,370
trunks.
Um,

22
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,240
so I was pulling the hunch of foundry,
a six foot waves crashing down and,

23
00:01:01,241 --> 00:01:03,520
and I actually didn't make it from point
to point.

24
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:07,870
I was like five kilometers from the end.
And when I didn't make it,

25
00:01:07,871 --> 00:01:08,704
I decided to swing back the other way.
So I ended up swimming over a hundred 

26
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,610
kilometers with a hundred pound tree.
It took me 32 hours,

27
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,440
but still didn't make it.
So,

28
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,210
so what,
what,

29
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,990
what went wrong where you didn't make 
it?

30
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,940
Tides currents,
you know,

31
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:22,331
and,
and I,

32
00:01:22,331 --> 00:01:23,470
you just get swept away.

33
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

34
00:01:24,521 --> 00:01:26,260
And especially attached to a tree,
right?

35
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,060
How big secrets his tree.
Uh,

36
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,470
so a hundred pounds,
but I mean,

37
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:31,150
it floats,
but it was more of the drag.

38
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,323
So if there's any influence from tidal 
currents and it's pulling you in one 

39
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:35,980
direction,
I mean,

40
00:01:35,981 --> 00:01:39,400
I was basically gonna Miss Martinique 
know I was heading to Cuba,

41
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,660
you know,
somewhere like that.

42
00:01:40,661 --> 00:01:41,494
And then on the way back down,
and they turned to me again and they 

43
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:45,790
said like,
you're going to miss St Lucia,

44
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,633
you're going to end up in how to net 
whatevers further south than Saint 

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,710
Lucia.
Um,

46
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,010
and I think I realized this as 
physically fit as you are.

47
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,590
Um,
the ocean just,

48
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,180
just doesn't care,
doesn't care.

49
00:01:58,181 --> 00:02:00,130
And so after that,
this was last year,

50
00:02:00,131 --> 00:02:02,240
this was November last year.
Um,

51
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,530
kind of felt I had unfinished business 
with the ocean.

52
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,210
Um,
came back,

53
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:08,044
came back to England,
a rung up from friends of mine at the 

54
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,680
Royal Marines.

55
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,371
I said,
guys,

56
00:02:12,371 --> 00:02:13,270
look,
this is going to sound so,

57
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:14,200
so strange.
I said,

58
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,510
but I just,
I need to get out of my system.

59
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,730
I just need to see how far I can swim in
48 hours.

60
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:21,180
So I swan 40 hours.
Um,

61
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,083
I can't remember.
It wasn't there and it was 160 

62
00:02:23,051 --> 00:02:23,920
kilometers,
something,

63
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:24,754
something like that.
And I finished and I had basically 

64
00:02:27,251 --> 00:02:28,550
trench foot.
So where your,

65
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,550
your,
your feet and your hands are.

66
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,980
So kind of,
I've got so much water in.

67
00:02:32,981 --> 00:02:34,380
This one was going moldy,
you know?

68
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,070
Yeah.
So I had 21,

69
00:02:36,071 --> 00:02:37,300
I'm sort of sitting there,
nursing,

70
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,830
nursing my feet.
And uh,

71
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,420
one of the,
one of the offices,

72
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,580
uh,
a good friend of mine and they came over

73
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,443
and they just said,
uh,

74
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,900
you know,
real English royal.

75
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,780
And they said,
you boy.

76
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,093
And I said,
yes.

77
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:48,671
And they said,
oh,

78
00:02:48,671 --> 00:02:49,870
what do you,
what are you training for?

79
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:50,883
And I said,
uh,

80
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,753
oh.
And I'm training for a potentially 

81
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,950
attempting the world's longest current 
neutral swim.

82
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,040
And then just paused and he sits his cup
of tea

83
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,470
and he looked me up and down.
He just goes at,

84
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:04,360
just sounds a bit lame.
I was like,

85
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:06,790
okay,
what would you want me to do?

86
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,550
And he pauses and he says,
you just need to man up.

87
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,260
We need to man up and swim around Great 
Britain.

88
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,090
And I was like,
Whoa,

89
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,983
I can't,
I can't.

90
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,080
I couldn't say no once the agency,
why don't you swim with me bitch,

91
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,983
motherfucker,
that's a crazy thing for someone to be 

92
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:24,480
asking you to do.
Now I know,

93
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,620
right?
So I said,

94
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:28,270
fine.
Once the idea stuck with me,

95
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,700
I mean,
you know,

96
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,150
we've got this real history and heritage
of,

97
00:03:32,151 --> 00:03:36,430
of British eccentric explorers.
And for me growing up,

98
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:37,264
there's a story of Captain Web.
So the first guy to swim across the 

99
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:40,324
English Channel,
and for those who don't know English 

100
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:42,311
Channel,
uh,

101
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:43,180
you know,
the tides,

102
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,020
they believe what?

103
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,880
We're too strong.
The water was too cold.

104
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:49,000
They said you just can't make it across.
The English Channel isn't possible.

105
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,630
But captain web refused to listen and a 
1875 August across the English Channel,

106
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:56,044
and this is the part I love on a diet of
beef broth and brandy in a woolen 

107
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:00,490
wetsuit.
He swam,

108
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:04,450
I think it was 23 hours breaststroke 
with his head out of the water because,

109
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:05,284
and I quote front crawl was 
ungentlemanly like and there was that 

110
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:11,890
element that I just thought that's so 
amazing.

111
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,690
Front crawl,
what does the front crossbar,

112
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,000
so it's a basically that's front the 
regular one.

113
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,460
Yeah.
But way back in 1875 it was like,

114
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:19,294
no,
that's sorrows and gentlemanly the 

115
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:23,470
movement itself themselves.
Yeah.

116
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,240
It was still being developed as a 
technique.

117
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:26,074
Whereas you know,
if you are a gentleman and you were a 

118
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,950
swimmer,
you swim breaststroke,

119
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,760
you know,
exactly.

120
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,550
Head out of the water the whole time,
the whole way.

121
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:34,960
23 hours.
And again,

122
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:35,771
like th the,
the,

123
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:37,350
the support boat was saying,
you know,

124
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,081
get out,
you're not,

125
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:39,130
you're not going to make,
you're not going to make it.

126
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:41,230
And he just refused and 23 hours.
So you know,

127
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:44,200
that's part of a night swim as well.
Had out the water just all the way.

128
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,590
Why Brandy?
Is he getting fucked up or just a little

129
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:49,890
bit of brand?
Do you know?

130
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,733
I don't know,
maybe it might have been a bit of Dutch 

131
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:52,714
courage,
but I think there was certainly back 

132
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:56,020
then sports nutrition isn't what it is 
today.

133
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,480
Right.
So I think there was an element,

134
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,190
he was even like lubing himself up in 
goose fat,

135
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,043
you know,
this is waiting back and make himself 

136
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,490
slicker,
slicker.

137
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:05,450
And I think there was an element of warm
for that was the,

138
00:05:05,451 --> 00:05:06,430
certainly the belief.

139
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,430
Right.
So the Tour de France guys,

140
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:10,264
didn't they drink wine?
That was like a big thing back in the 

141
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:13,120
day.
Way Back.

142
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:14,500
Yeah.
I mean it wasn't too long ago.

143
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:15,850
It wouldn't be me and Jamie would just,
just,

144
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:18,370
just talking now about football back in 
England and it wasn't till,

145
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,350
you know too long ago,
I don't know,

146
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,193
maybe a hundred years ago.
They used to just keep brandy in the 

147
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:26,310
dressing room in case you needed to warm
yourself up real and out.

148
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,240
Oh yeah.
Wow.

149
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:30,550
So they play soccer drunk there.
Yeah,

150
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:32,860
kind of just slope with a little bit.
Like I said,

151
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:37,890
just turn it over.
Wow.

152
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,250
Wow.
I think,

153
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:41,470
you know,
people don't understand that it's taken,

154
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,990
you know,
people like Captain Web,

155
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:47,710
maybe me to a smaller extent to just 
raise the bar,

156
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:50,320
push the boundaries and,
and you know,

157
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,663
you've seen that,
I think our generation have seen that 

158
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:57,250
with the UFC with mixed martial arts 
that has evolved so fast.

159
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,190
I'm always remember

160
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,023
forrest griffin used the kind of a 
likened himself to the basketball 

161
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:04,240
players just shooting three pointers 
with the ball between the legs,

162
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:05,074
you know?
And that always resonated with me 

163
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:07,281
because I was like,
yeah,

164
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:08,114
the evolution that we've seen and what 
sort of Bruce Lee had the foresight to 

165
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:15,140
predict is amazing.
And I think in a,

166
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:15,980
in a much,
much,

167
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:18,200
much smaller way.
Again,

168
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:20,480
to go back to sort of British athletes 
and adventurers.

169
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,860
Roger bannister first nights running a 
four minute mile people said couldn't be

170
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:26,780
done.
And he was a medical student at the time

171
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,270
leading physicians that he can't do it.
Your lungs will explode,

172
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:30,740
your legs will fall off.
All sorts.

173
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,540
But no,
he said,

174
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,403
you know,
Oxford laced up his trainers and ran a 

175
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:36,824
four minute mile similar right now to 
what I think we're seeing with Kip 

176
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:41,421
Shogi,
you know,

177
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:42,680
and,
and the two hour marathon.

178
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,450
And so that's why,
and again,

179
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:45,830
in a much,
much smaller way,

180
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,100
when I had that conversation about 
swimming around Great Britain,

181
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,710
everybody said it can't be done.
Yes,

182
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:55,290
it's 2000 miles.
But there's giant whirlpools in Scotland

183
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,910
called the Chorea Vecan pentland firth 
renowned around the world.

184
00:06:58,911 --> 00:06:59,744
If you get that wrong,
you'll disappear in backwards at 10 

185
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:02,684
knots.
You,

186
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,460
there's no way you're swimming against 
that.

187
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:07,010
And 10 us,
that's a dolphin speed.

188
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,870
She was 10 knots in miles per hour.
A basically 10 miles per hour,

189
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,910
10 miles per hour backwards as you're 
trying to go forwards basically.

190
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:18,590
Yeah.
Penn versus the top of Scotland,

191
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:21,950
the currents that go across there.
So it's running at a good clip,

192
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,903
but yo,
yeah.

193
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,710
Yeah.
I mean we got it good.

194
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,700
We managed to basically predict it so 
well that I,

195
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,250
I think that was probably my top speed,
which I did 8.7

196
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:32,780
knots is 8.7
miles per hour.

197
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,260
I was basically cruising along the top,
which is wow,

198
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,960
we just like a dolphin.
So you were having the waves behind you,

199
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,093
pushing you almost and see now that's 
what's interesting because I had the 

200
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:43,514
tides and currents with me,
not necessarily the way I said it wrong 

201
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,113
and when you get bit,
but actually you made a good point in 

202
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:49,244
terms of when you get windover tide.
So if you've got 10 knots going this 

203
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,350
way,
but he even got a little bit of wind and

204
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:59,351
waves going this way,
it can get choppy again and again.

205
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:02,480
Sort of looking at west Scotland,
windover tide,

206
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,900
you can get 40 knots coming straight 
down the barrel,

207
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,340
but you're trying to swim with the tide.
Yeah,

208
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:13,310
the wind is coming at you,
but the tide is going the opposite.

209
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,680
And as you can imagine that,
oh my God.

210
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:16,640
Yeah.
Yeah.

211
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,070
So how do you predict this,
this,

212
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,340
this tide that you have to get right?
Yeah,

213
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:24,800
I mean it's,
it's in completely in theory.

214
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,760
And this is what I realized when I sat 
down and we started sort of plotting the

215
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:29,780
great,
what is this called again?

216
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:32,060
What is the,
the issue that will push you back?

217
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,080
Oh,
just the title.

218
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:34,340
Yes.
What is it called?

219
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,640
That area.
Oh,

220
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,980
so you got to get right.
Oh,

221
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:41,570
so penn unferth pending for the panel 
and for Pendleton for,

222
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,650
yeah.
Yeah.

223
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:44,330
And that's that,
like I said,

224
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:46,220
renowned around the world.
But equally,

225
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,440
if you imagine the shape of Great 
Britain,

226
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,303
there's all sorts of kind of compression
where the water would just come rushing 

227
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:55,100
through.
And as well as the panel and firth,

228
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,980
you can get,
you know,

229
00:08:55,981 --> 00:08:58,740
six knots around whales.
There's an island called Scoma.

230
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,860
And if you get that right,
you are disappearing,

231
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,940
you know,
and you're winning,

232
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,000
you get it wrong again,
you're going backwards.

233
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:10,230
And for my,
for me to do a continuous stage swim,

234
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,473
if I'm going backwards,
I've got to start where I was going 

235
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:15,150
backwards.
So for me,

236
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,253
getting every single tied right.
And that's why so far the team were 

237
00:09:18,481 --> 00:09:19,680
amazing.
There was a,

238
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:20,803
uh,
the Captain Matt was just incredible 

239
00:09:22,741 --> 00:09:25,240
that every night the homework,
are we okay here?

240
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,060
No.
Did we crash?

241
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,360
All right folks,
if you're listening or watching,

242
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,523
we had a little technical difficulty,
so this is not streaming live will be 

243
00:09:33,811 --> 00:09:34,644
uploaded later.
We were just going over how you 

244
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:41,670
predicted you had to,
you and your team had to predict how the

245
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:42,504
tide was coming because if it went wrong
you'd get pushed backwards and like 10 

246
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:46,290
miles an hour.
Yeah.

247
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,330
Basically.
And the,

248
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,530
and this is the thing,
I think with the great British swim,

249
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:53,850
we were kind of taking swimming as most 
people understand it and we were,

250
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,960
we were removing it and putting it in an
arena that was so different.

251
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,600
So I think that's why it was,
it did so well kind of online as well as

252
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:05,250
the community around it because 
obviously swimmers were interested,

253
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:06,084
but you know,
surfers started to get involved because 

254
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:09,200
they understood the waves.
Um,

255
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,560
sailors,
fisherman,

256
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:12,180
you know,
all sorts of people started to say,

257
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,270
you know,
sometimes in Great Britain it's not safe

258
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:17,610
to take a boat around the top of 
Scotland.

259
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,331
In it,
for instance,

260
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:20,280
nevermind a swimmer.
Um,

261
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,590
so that's,
that's why it was amazing that,

262
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,470
that on the entire series it became,
uh,

263
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,543
a melting pot and exchange of ideas 
because nobody knew how to get a human 

264
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:35,510
body around the coast of Great Britain.
It wasn't just about swimming and,

265
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,590
and that was what was really cool.
How,

266
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,010
how do they know,
like when the tides are going one way or

267
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:42,660
the other,
how do they predict that?

268
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,110
Yeah,
I mean,

269
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,280
tied to so predictable.

270
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,950
So in theory,
they change every six hours.

271
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,440
So in theory,
when we sat down and we looked,

272
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,630
and we know that if you do six hours on 
six hours off for 157 days,

273
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,520
you'll make it around the coast of Great
Britain.

274
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,111
You know?
And,

275
00:10:57,111 --> 00:10:58,260
and,
and that was the theory.

276
00:10:58,261 --> 00:11:01,380
So you do this by phasic sleep and you 
swim for 12 hours a day.

277
00:11:01,381 --> 00:11:03,960
But that's all theory.
There's times when,

278
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:06,330
as I mentioned,
a giant whirlpools or,

279
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,330
or the tides might not necessarily,
if you imagine sort of,

280
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,193
that's Great Britain there,
the tides don't necessarily go always 

281
00:11:12,991 --> 00:11:14,250
like this or they're not that 
predictable.

282
00:11:14,251 --> 00:11:18,840
Sometimes if there's kind of like this,
like that's kind of whales there,

283
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,700
the tides will do this.
So you're,

284
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,260
you're doing all these different things 
that people are not going to see instead

285
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:28,230
of listening to it on audio.
So just try to just describe it.

286
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,063
Right.
It's a basically rather than the tides 

287
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,100
just going up and down and working with 
you,

288
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,360
sometimes they cross cross.
Yeah.

289
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,720
So you'll just kind of getting slapped 
across the face.

290
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,720
My tides essentially.
And it's not just helping you,

291
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,070
you're going to basically zigzag all the
way up the coast of Great Britain.

292
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:44,904
So it was predictable as tides are.
We found those so much stuff that when 

293
00:11:47,851 --> 00:11:49,080
we're out there we were like,
oh,

294
00:11:49,081 --> 00:11:49,914
it wasn't meant to do that.
Or a giant whirlpool wasn't meant to be 

295
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,270
there,
but it is an,

296
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,760
and that was what was pretty,
yeah,

297
00:11:57,761 --> 00:11:59,230
pretty sketchy.
It sometimes,

298
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,350
you know that when we were out there,
if a whirlpool just decides to appear,

299
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,050
you've got you,
there's not really enough time to say,

300
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:05,591
oh,
hang on,

301
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,330
that wasn't on the map.
Can we look at that?

302
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:09,550
Can we speak to the Met Office and talk 
about,

303
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,540
you know,
weather reports?

304
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,373
No,
you just,

305
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,040
you,
I've had to swim through it or,

306
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,800
or try and get out there as quick as you
could.

307
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,500
So when you encounter something like 
that and you get stuck,

308
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:21,460
do you pull out of the water and try 
back again later at the same location?

309
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,920
You do.
But quite often if it was there,

310
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,380
it's still gonna be there.
Oh,

311
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,440
it's just,
it is what it is.

312
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,460
Yeah.
So sometimes there's this notion and,

313
00:12:29,461 --> 00:12:32,100
and perhaps the best example of this,
I mentioned it for,

314
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,760
it's called the Chorea Vecan.
So,

315
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:34,883
uh,
sort of west coast of Scotland and it's 

316
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:38,640
a giant whirlpool.
And,

317
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,270
and Matt,
the captain turned to me and said,

318
00:12:40,271 --> 00:12:41,104
look,
Ross,

319
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,023
you know,
I need you to swim and I need you to 

320
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:43,291
swim hard.
You know,

321
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,124
you need to swim six hours.
You just need to be clear this 

322
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:46,810
whirlpool.
Um,

323
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:47,644
so as we were swimming past it,
I set my watch and some hard for six 

324
00:12:50,351 --> 00:12:51,820
hours,
but about three hours in,

325
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:52,903
um,
I got stung by jellyfish and I've been 

326
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,700
stung by jellyfish a lot before he sees,
you know,

327
00:12:57,701 --> 00:12:58,900
it's painful,
but it was,

328
00:12:58,990 --> 00:12:59,860
it was bearable.

329
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,590
Um,
but this one particular jellyfish,

330
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,150
it just,
it was searing into my skin.

331
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,670
It just,
it wouldn't stop throbbing.

332
00:13:06,671 --> 00:13:07,504
And so I carried on swimming,
three hours passed and it was just 

333
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:11,014
unbearable.
So I popped my head up and I looked at 

334
00:13:11,861 --> 00:13:13,060
Matt,
the captain from the boat.

335
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,141
I said,
man,

336
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:15,670
I'm so sorry I've been stung and,
and you know,

337
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:17,090
I'm going to have to stop.
Um,

338
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,990
I've been stung by a jellyfish,
pitched the pain's just not going away.

339
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,460
And as,
as I said that to him,

340
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:22,660
he looked down at me and he said,
yeah,

341
00:13:22,661 --> 00:13:24,760
I know,
cause the tentacles still wrapped around

342
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:27,640
your face.
So I'd basically been swimming for three

343
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:31,540
hours with a jellyfish on your case,
wearing a jellyfish.

344
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,300
It wrapped into my goggles.
So I took my gold,

345
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,580
unpeel this fat,
tend to call,

346
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,810
threw it away.
Um,

347
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,830
and then like I said,
I,

348
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:42,940
I'll show you in a minute.

349
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,480
I'll ever,
there was a picture where my,

350
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,333
my face sorta change shape and the 
goggles wouldn't fit on my face anymore 

351
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,400
because my eye sockets were so swelled.
And,

352
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,940
but I knew that again,
for all of this happening,

353
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,460
the cory of Eq and the giant Walpole was
still to my left.

354
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,020
So Matt was like,
you still need to swim.

355
00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:01,360
You still need to swim.
So I ended up paying the goggles over my

356
00:14:01,361 --> 00:14:06,160
face and to try and get them to seal,
I just punched them into my face.

357
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,530
So you just had these perfect ring and 
then I managed,

358
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:09,700
you're a sore.
Swollen.

359
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,563
Yeah.
So you're a push them through the 

360
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,300
swelling basically.
Yeah.

361
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,490
John.
So you swim.

362
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:16,690
Um,
I made another hour.

363
00:14:16,691 --> 00:14:17,524
We got clear the cory of Atkins.
We managed to clear this giant 

364
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:22,810
whirlpool.
I collapse onto the boat and um,

365
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,703
and this is the thing,
it was at that point that I collapsed 

366
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,260
exhausted face.

367
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,170
Now a different shape to when I started 
that particular swim.

368
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,423
And,
um,

369
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,130
and the team looked at me and they saw 
how bad I was,

370
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:33,973
how be it an upper was,
but they also knew that the sea just 

371
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:37,624
doesn't care.
And in six hours the tide was going to 

372
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,920
change and I'm not going to have to do 
that all over again.

373
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,460
And it was that kind of brutal lesson 
from nature that,

374
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,440
that from a sports science background,
I'm interested in,

375
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,710
you know,
Rehab,

376
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:52,521
rest,
recovery,

377
00:14:52,521 --> 00:14:54,350
nutrition strategies,
all of this.

378
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,180
But with sending around Great Britain,
it very quickly became apparent that the

379
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:00,014
seed just doesn't care.
It just doesn't care that you need to 

380
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:03,854
rehab your shoulders.
It doesn't care that the ligaments and 

381
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:06,074
tendons in your shoulders are hurting.
You might get impingement from swimming 

382
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:10,760
too much in none of this.
And,

383
00:15:10,761 --> 00:15:11,594
um,
that's why it went from swimming as I 

384
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:15,584
understood it and how a lot of people 
understand it to something completely 

385
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:20,450
like surviving basically in the water.

386
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,553
So you're swimming schedule,
it'd be six hours on and then you would 

387
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,390
try to rest.
When would you eat?

388
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,120
Uh,
during the swims or,

389
00:15:28,121 --> 00:15:30,140
or between Erin?
The swims.

390
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,130
Yeah.
Yes.

391
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,600
I quite often just,
you know,

392
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:37,130
throwing bananas at me and just multi 
bananas basically.

393
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:38,240
Yeah.
Yeah.

394
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:39,074
Just so deep or not.
And you'd eat and while you're in the 

395
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:41,330
water.
Yeah.

396
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:41,991
Wow.
Yeah.

397
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:42,830
Cause,
cause again,

398
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,660
going back to what we're talking about 
with the pen and firth,

399
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,700
you could get out and you could get on 
the boat,

400
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:51,701
but sometimes in a really good tide,
if you are just in the water,

401
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,560
you could be making four knots.
You don't have to swim.

402
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,513
But if you'd get in the freezing cold 
water Scotland and you are quite happy 

403
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:01,790
to getting hit in the face by a 10th,
cause you can still make four knots.

404
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,950
And so that's why so often it became 
about something different than swimming.

405
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,050
It was just,
it was just mental fortitude.

406
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,850
It was physical fortitude.
It was,

407
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,950
um,
basically,

408
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,430
I always remember actually,
yeah,

409
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,400
First Day of autumn,
um,

410
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,510
I got up,
it was two o'clock,

411
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:18,200
so it was a night,
2:00

412
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,410
AM two o'clock in the morning and I left
my wetsuit out to dry.

413
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,303
And I had to scrape.
It's just a thin layer of ice off the 

414
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:29,360
wet suit before I could put it.
But if I didn't,

415
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,910
if I didn't get in and I didn't screw it
that,

416
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,850
that,
that way I see it,

417
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,500
then that would have been,
you know,

418
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:35,900
15 miles potentially that we would have 
missed out on.

419
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,763
And if you miss those 15 miles,
that the window of opportunity to swim 

420
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,163
around Great Britain because of the 
British summer being notoriously 

421
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,330
unpredictable and quite short.
Um,

422
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,623
we wouldn't have made it round because 
even towards the end there was two 

423
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,134
storms,
a storm elements storm Cali Allien 

424
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,733
Callum,
who kind of stopped us for those two 

425
00:16:56,601 --> 00:16:59,450
days where we couldn't swim because you 
just couldn't swim in a storm.

426
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,430
It wasn't safe.
So when you were swimming,

427
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:03,350
this was all during the summer?
Yeah,

428
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,050
yeah.
Uh,

429
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:04,883
freely the autumn.
And then we finished November the 

430
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,510
fourth,
which was going into the winter as well.

431
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,360
And you started what month?
Uh,

432
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,360
June.
The first.

433
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:12,194
So for,
since June you've been swimming 

434
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,150
basically?
God Damn,

435
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:19,520
man.
That's so crazy.

436
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,230
Yeah,
it's interesting too.

437
00:17:21,231 --> 00:17:24,710
You're not built like a guy,
I'd expect to be doing this.

438
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:25,703
Right.
You're building a tank like does not 

439
00:17:27,561 --> 00:17:28,394
normal like your big jacked guy.
You look more like an MMA fighter or a 

440
00:17:31,811 --> 00:17:33,420
powerlifter even.
Right.

441
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,540
You don't look like an endurance 
athlete.

442
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,400
Yeah.
Which is,

443
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,390
and we were just,
we were speaking about it cause I,

444
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,100
I love the episode with unct Fletcher.
I love that guy.

445
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,170
I love that.
And,

446
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:42,930
and,
and you know,

447
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:43,910
as a big fan of,
you know,

448
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:44,690
Kathy,
you are,

449
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,660
look at this fucking picture dude.

450
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,793
Get the fuck out of.
If someone said that guys get a swim 

451
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:53,600
around grape Linda,
I was going to swim for half an hour and

452
00:17:53,601 --> 00:17:55,900
he's going to have a fucking heart 
attack there.

453
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:56,901
There was a lot.
Yeah,

454
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:58,650
I know I'd probably be inclined to agree
with you.

455
00:17:58,651 --> 00:17:59,484
But what I find interesting is when you 
start looking at a strength and stamina 

456
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,940
for so often,
people believe the two couldn't coexist.

457
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,103
And Robert Hickson and his,
his sort of research ran concurrent 

458
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:12,130
training that,
um,

459
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,300
basically saying if you train for 
strength and stamina,

460
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,590
you dilute the potency of the stimulate.
So what what I mean by that is if,

461
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,110
you know,
we went into the gym just now and uh,

462
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:22,801
you know,
meet me,

463
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,390
you and Jamie walked into the gym and we
were like,

464
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:24,901
okay,
okay,

465
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:25,734
let's,
let's go and see what we're doing on in 

466
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,500
the squat rack.

467
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,251
You know,
that's strength,

468
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:30,084
your body's ability to generate force.
And we trained that and then all of a 

469
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:32,470
sudden it's like,
okay,

470
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:32,671
no,
no,

471
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:32,881
no,
no.

472
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:35,040
Now let's go over to the rowing machine 
or let's go for a swim.

473
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:35,874
Let's go and swim 10 k.
Then all of a sudden our bodies are 

474
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,581
going to go,
well,

475
00:18:38,581 --> 00:18:40,920
hang on.
Which one do you want us to adapt to?

476
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,620
Looking at molecular biology,
which one do you want us to adapt to?

477
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,800
Strength and stamina.
And again,

478
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:48,540
you dilute the potency,
that stimuli.

479
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,703
However,
there's the theory that if you separate 

480
00:18:51,571 --> 00:18:52,404
them within the laws,
I'm going off on a little bit of a 

481
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:55,590
tangent here,
but please.

482
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,900
Thank you.
Good looking at,

483
00:18:57,901 --> 00:18:58,980
um,
Verkishanski.

484
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,440
So one of the greatest strength and 
conditioning coaches to ever exist.

485
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,840
He talks about this idea of adaptive 
energy,

486
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,900
saying that in any given day you have a 
certain amount of adaptive energy and if

487
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:13,320
you are able to fit both a training 
session,

488
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:14,280
that that,
like I said,

489
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:16,390
causes your body to adapt to both 
strength and stamina.

490
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,200
You separate them under those 
conditions,

491
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:22,110
they can coexist.
So you separated them by how much time?

492
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,110
As much as needed for optimal recovery.
So,

493
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:25,941
so yeah,
if,

494
00:19:25,941 --> 00:19:27,060
if we did,
and this is the,

495
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:30,840
this is what I find fascinating about 
mma because you're essentially saying to

496
00:19:30,841 --> 00:19:34,140
an MMA athlete,
I need you to be strong fast,

497
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:36,060
quick,
I need you to be muscular and Jord,

498
00:19:36,061 --> 00:19:38,190
but I also need you to apply a metric 
speed,

499
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:41,360
strength and their body's going,
you want us to be all of those things.

500
00:19:41,361 --> 00:19:42,240
Right.
You know,

501
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:43,074
and that's why quite often it's the 
athlete with a higher work capacity who 

502
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:48,530
can adapt to those looking at like,
you know,

503
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,940
the Diaz brothers who just do triathlons
for fun,

504
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,730
you know,
they have this insane work capacity.

505
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,033
So that's kind of your,
your body's ability to perform and 

506
00:19:57,481 --> 00:20:00,540
positively tolerate training of a given 
intensity or duration.

507
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,910
So if you have the Diaz brothers and you
say,

508
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,920
okay,
we're going to now do weight training in

509
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:05,754
the morning,
but by the afternoon I also need you to 

510
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,750
swim a 10 k their bodies could tolerate 
that.

511
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:14,090
Whereas if you have another athlete who 
perhaps doesn't have that work,

512
00:20:14,091 --> 00:20:14,924
pasty,
their body's not going to positively 

513
00:20:15,901 --> 00:20:16,960
tolerate it.
Right?

514
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,440
A person who's used to working out maybe
only an hour a day.

515
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,610
Yeah,
absolutely.

516
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:24,060
So,
so that's essentially how I would,

517
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:24,910
would,
uh,

518
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,020
approach anything like this.
But what I found really interesting when

519
00:20:28,021 --> 00:20:28,854
you were talking with,
with ct Fletcher was when you look at 

520
00:20:32,851 --> 00:20:34,080
strength and stamina,
it's,

521
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,930
it's so specific.
So you know,

522
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,370
said principle specific adaptation to 
impose demands.

523
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:40,320
You know,
you get good at whatever you continually

524
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:41,154
practice.
And when you look at endurance in 

525
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:45,474
weightbearing sports absolutely know,
you can argue that that running for 

526
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:49,960
instance is,
is just,

527
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,040
you know,
power to weight ratio.

528
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:55,450
It's a series of successive jumps and 
when you start looking at that,

529
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,523
there's research that will show adding,
and we did this with the Royal Marines 

530
00:20:58,931 --> 00:20:59,764
back in England.
When you just add one keeler of extra 

531
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:05,500
weight in a backpack,
it's effect on pulmonary ventilation,

532
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:07,360
lactic threshold,
time to fatigue,

533
00:21:07,361 --> 00:21:08,800
all of those things.
Just one,

534
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,000
one kilogram.
That's it.

535
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,090
And so that's why when you see tour de 
France and people like Chris Froome,

536
00:21:13,091 --> 00:21:16,810
Bradley wiggins unit from team sky,
they are just looking at the body saying

537
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,340
okay your vo two is what it is.
Your power to,

538
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,520
your power to weight ratio.
That's what we need to improve.

539
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:23,410
We need to treat you like a formula one 
car.

540
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,030
We need to take away anything,
you know.

541
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:28,190
So when you look at Chris' room in an 
unbelievable athlete and they said,

542
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,490
well you don't need biceps,
you don't need triceps.

543
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,520
So there we'll remove those controlled 
muscular atrophy.

544
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,680
And how do they approach that 
intelligently?

545
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,640
I,
I suppose looking at anything from,

546
00:21:39,641 --> 00:21:40,474
you know,
a calorie deficits are not to pick 

547
00:21:41,451 --> 00:21:43,150
anything up ever.
Kind of.

548
00:21:43,151 --> 00:21:45,890
Yeah.
And it's just exactly,

549
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,370
that's crazy.
There is,

550
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,940
there you go.
No triceps.

551
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,320
They don't,
they went away.

552
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,390
Exactly.
But I mean that is,

553
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,330
that is the perfect example of,
you know,

554
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,193
said principle specific adaptation to 
impose demands that all he does is he 

555
00:21:59,441 --> 00:22:01,780
lives on a bike.
So as a result,

556
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:02,614
his body is,
is a byproduct of what he continually 

557
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,190
practices.
Got Bike muscles.

558
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,780
Yeah.
Yeah.

559
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,690
And so,
so looking at that and sorry,

560
00:22:10,691 --> 00:22:13,210
going back to strength and stamina,
when you look at running,

561
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,980
you could argue that you know,
being jacked and,

562
00:22:15,981 --> 00:22:17,620
and being heavier.
Yes,

563
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,693
absolutely.
Your power to weight ratio is going to 

564
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,430
impact you.
So for instance,

565
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,210
I like to run but I don't stand a chance
against some of my friends who are,

566
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:26,700
you know,
fell runners and they way,

567
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,300
you know,
30 kilos less than me,

568
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,170
however ritual.

569
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,650
Exactly.
Yeah.

570
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,670
And lean longer.
Yeah.

571
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:36,280
You look at him,
unbelievable specimen of a man.

572
00:22:36,281 --> 00:22:36,761
You Go,
yes,

573
00:22:36,761 --> 00:22:40,450
you were built for endurance,
but as soon as you go in the water,

574
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:43,810
things might start to change a little 
bit because now it's non weight bearing.

575
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,820
So the power to weight ratio is a little
bit different.

576
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,730
So then you could not,
and this is all theory for the moment,

577
00:22:48,731 --> 00:22:49,564
but looking at the body shape to swim 
around great brim cause no one's ever 

578
00:22:52,931 --> 00:22:54,730
done it before.
So you can say,

579
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,280
okay well what does that body type look 
like?

580
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,460
And when writing down a checklist,
you say,

581
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,650
we need someone who can swim in,
you know,

582
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,050
40 knots of wind,
wind over time that we're talking about.

583
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,600
So you're not going to break.
I'm on top of that as well.

584
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:09,190
You can start to look at,
um,

585
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,580
all of a sudden we need someone who's 
never going to take a day off.

586
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:15,310
So I wasn't sick for out of those 157 
days.

587
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:18,270
So then you start looking at adaptive 
energy and,

588
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,380
and work capacity there would just spoke
about,

589
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,873
and then all of a sudden you can start 
getting real into the detail of looking 

590
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:24,881
at,
okay,

591
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:25,714
someone with a higher muscle mass,
if they're able to effectively swim and 

592
00:23:29,351 --> 00:23:31,630
the biomechanics are,
are on point.

593
00:23:31,631 --> 00:23:32,710
So that's not,
you know,

594
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,200
this muscle mass isn't interfering with 
their biomechanics.

595
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,393
Could it be argued that that's stored 
muscle glycogen can almost turn them 

596
00:23:39,821 --> 00:23:41,680
into a human whale.
You know that.

597
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,760
Yeah,
you're right.

598
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,890
You put me into the pool with Michael 
Phelps and he,

599
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,080
me,
you know,

600
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,290
he to look at him swim,
it's unbelief.

601
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,630
He looks like a dolphin.
It's beautiful.

602
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,410
But when it comes to something like 
seminar in Great Britain,

603
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,870
it's just,
it's just an eating competition,

604
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,733
you know,
with a little bit of swimming involved 

605
00:23:58,551 --> 00:24:01,190
and you just need to make sure you don't
break.

606
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,190
And that goes back to the tides as well.
Your body working with ties.

607
00:24:04,191 --> 00:24:08,360
If you can just keep getting in the 
water for 157 days,

608
00:24:08,361 --> 00:24:12,240
12 hours a day and not break,
you'll make it wound Great Britain by.

609
00:24:12,241 --> 00:24:14,990
So you think the muscle mass aids you in
that way?

610
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,000
I would argue,
yes.

611
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:17,661
Yeah.
I mean,

612
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:18,494
and this is purely anecdotal and I'd 
love to actually do more research into 

613
00:24:20,841 --> 00:24:21,230
this,
but,

614
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,063
but certainly with a lot of athletes 
that I train with that it's almost like 

615
00:24:25,251 --> 00:24:27,500
a bell curve.
So if you can imagine,

616
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:28,363
you know,
for those listening like a bell curve 

617
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:32,090
like that,
how would you describe that?

618
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,850
Just to sort of like a horseshoe?
Yeah.

619
00:24:34,851 --> 00:24:35,684
Yeah.
So you can argue that here around 

620
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,993
endurance.
So if you've got somebody who's you 

621
00:24:39,681 --> 00:24:40,550
know,
to use rich rituals,

622
00:24:40,551 --> 00:24:41,900
example,
an amazing swimmer,

623
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:42,943
the over 10 K he's going to be amazing 
because there's efficiency in 

624
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:45,320
everything.

625
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,153
But then pass this point.
So when we start looking at the mileage 

626
00:24:48,351 --> 00:24:51,290
that we were covering,
so it sort of English Channel Swim is 20

627
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:54,050
miles plus a day.
At this point,

628
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,213
this leaner swimmer's going to start 
running out of muscle glycogen is 

629
00:24:57,681 --> 00:24:58,514
biomechanics might break down because he
doesn't have the strength to hold that 

630
00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:03,410
position continually.
All of those things,

631
00:25:03,411 --> 00:25:04,244
the waves start crashing and he's 
starting to swimming to 40 knots of 

632
00:25:06,111 --> 00:25:07,730
wind.
What's going to happen?

633
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,570
Are you going to be,
would you favor the,

634
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,573
the lean a quicker,
more streamlined swimmer or would you 

635
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:16,610
argue that the guy who have more muscle 
mass here is going to continue to swim?

636
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,390
Not necessarily at the same pace,
but would continue not to break?

637
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:23,450
I think it depends on who the man with 
the muscle mass is.

638
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:28,040
Because a lot of guys with muscle mass,
they got that muscle mass are doing very

639
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,050
low reps,
high weight.

640
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,453
I mean what,
what kind of exercise do you do that 

641
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:34,970
gives you a bill like that?
See and that's a good point.

642
00:25:34,971 --> 00:25:38,500
I mean I loved what you did with them 
with Dorian Yates and um,

643
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,673
I think when you start looking at the,
the three mechanisms to build muscular 

644
00:25:43,011 --> 00:25:46,580
hypertrophy,
you start looking at metabolic stress.

645
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,730
So metabolic stress being exactly what 
you just said.

646
00:25:49,731 --> 00:25:52,220
Lots and lots of reps during yes being a
great example of that.

647
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,293
That is more muscular hypertrophy,
bodybuilding centric work and that's 

648
00:25:56,691 --> 00:25:58,460
metabolic stress.
Lots and lots of reps.

649
00:25:58,970 --> 00:25:59,803
But then you can also look at mechanical
tension to that's more your power 

650
00:26:02,451 --> 00:26:03,950
lifters,
you know,

651
00:26:03,951 --> 00:26:05,000
really,
really high weight,

652
00:26:05,001 --> 00:26:06,470
lower volume,
just real strength.

653
00:26:06,471 --> 00:26:09,620
Your body's ability to generate force.
That is what I do.

654
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,240
Um,
and yes,

655
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,270
it's shown to induce muscular 
hypertrophy is to increase muscle mass,

656
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,340
but arguably more functional than when 
you'd be looking at a,

657
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:20,301
you know,
bodybuilding,

658
00:26:20,301 --> 00:26:21,860
Mr Olympia,
something like that.

659
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:25,620
And then you have a muscle damage,
which has more eccentric contraction,

660
00:26:25,621 --> 00:26:30,621
some more arguably sort of crossfit a 
bodybuilder to achieve their physique.

661
00:26:30,771 --> 00:26:34,760
Besides using steroids,
they have to use lots of repetitions.

662
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,470
Yeah.
Yeah.

663
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:37,430
That's it.
So,

664
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,980
so when you say what do I do?
I specifically use,

665
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,010
it's more mechanical tension.
So more power cleans,

666
00:26:44,011 --> 00:26:45,540
deadlifts,
things along those lines.

667
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,470
He's exactly,
yeah,

668
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,460
yeah,
yeah.

669
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:49,180
Cause you're not billing a bodybuilder,
but you're,

670
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,090
you're built like someone was very 
strong.

671
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,640
Yeah.
And I think that's it where you start.

672
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:54,930
And that's not to say,
you know,

673
00:26:54,931 --> 00:26:56,110
when you look at,
you know,

674
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:59,010
to use you as an example.
So if we had you in the sports lab,

675
00:26:59,280 --> 00:26:59,881
we would say,
okay,

676
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:03,000
what is your strength deficits?
So your strength deficit is,

677
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:06,720
is I say we had you on the leg press and
we said,

678
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:07,554
Joe,
we want to,

679
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:11,610
we want to look at how much force your 
legs can generate with you.

680
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:16,610
Just using basically your training 
strength training strength is defined as

681
00:27:16,741 --> 00:27:19,590
the strength that you would use.
Just leg pressing,

682
00:27:19,591 --> 00:27:23,040
not getting you all like to cite of 
preworkouts smelling salts,

683
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:23,903
none of that.
We would just say Joe gun leg press and 

684
00:27:26,131 --> 00:27:28,380
you'd just leg press and that's what you
can generate there.

685
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,900
But then in the sports I back it left 
for university,

686
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:32,190
we would start using,
uh,

687
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,670
basically a lecture basically using 
electrical impulses to,

688
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,700
to make the muscles contract beyond what
you could generate yourself.

689
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:42,534
So that is what your body could generate
without you trying to send those 

690
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:45,810
impulses.
Buddies,

691
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,750
you the actual,
the actual potential muscle,

692
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,540
the strength of the muscles themselves.
How do you determine that?

693
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,310
Like I said,
basically,

694
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:54,780
um,
a lecture,

695
00:27:54,781 --> 00:27:55,614
cheating their muscles and stimulating 
it in voluntarily and through that they 

696
00:27:59,251 --> 00:28:01,040
measure it.
How so?

697
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,610
Oh,
so then that measures your,

698
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,663
uh,
your maximum output with you not trying 

699
00:28:05,431 --> 00:28:06,150
to use it yourself.

700
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:06,983
It's involuntary.
So that is something that you wouldn't 

701
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:10,800
have control over.
What do they,

702
00:28:10,801 --> 00:28:14,490
how do they do that?
Like essentially electricity cheap.

703
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,070
What kind of,
what does it like electrodes and slap on

704
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:19,470
your legs and they force you to extend 
your legs.

705
00:28:19,471 --> 00:28:20,520
Yeah.
You would have seen it.

706
00:28:20,521 --> 00:28:21,271
Yeah,
exactly.

707
00:28:21,271 --> 00:28:23,430
That you lift a weight with that.
Yeah.

708
00:28:23,431 --> 00:28:24,600
You can do,
yeah.

709
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:26,430
So that's what they do.
Yeah.

710
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,383
I've never heard of such a thing.
So you would be sitting in a leg press 

711
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:34,890
or engineering quad extensions and,
and make your legs extend.

712
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,753
Yeah.
Yeah.

713
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,190
Wow.
So they would monitor your strengths.

714
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:41,100
So the difference between that,
so all of a sudden they'll say,

715
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,270
okay,
this over here,

716
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,550
go training strength is what you could 
do,

717
00:28:44,551 --> 00:28:45,570
Joe,
when I was just saying,

718
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,770
okay,
lift that right.

719
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,000
And it's what you were going,
okay,

720
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,780
I'll lift it.

721
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,270
And then over here,
when it's involuntary,

722
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:56,400
that is what you could actually do.
That's the potential of the muscles.

723
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,470
What's usually the higher number?
Oh,

724
00:28:58,471 --> 00:28:59,220
absolutely.
Well,

725
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,930
so it's always involuntary,
really?

726
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:01,741
Always.
Yeah.

727
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:02,281
Yeah,
absolutely.

728
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:04,830
How much what?
And that's the strength deficits.

729
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,940
So do you see what I mean?
So,

730
00:29:05,941 --> 00:29:07,110
okay,
so over here,

731
00:29:07,111 --> 00:29:08,730
this is what you could generate when 
you're just going,

732
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,421
okay,
one,

733
00:29:09,421 --> 00:29:10,740
two,
three and I'm lifting it myself.

734
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,371
Ah,
okay.

735
00:29:11,371 --> 00:29:12,204
That done.
And over here is what we do when it's 

736
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:16,980
involuntary now and if there's a big 
deficit,

737
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,230
okay.
So if there's a huge deficit between the

738
00:29:19,231 --> 00:29:20,460
two,
that means you're a pussy.

739
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,610
It means your worth.
No,

740
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:29,190
it means if there's a large deficit 
between the two,

741
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,850
it means that you have muscle mass but 
you're not fully using it.

742
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,760
So you might see a large deficit between
the two.

743
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,270
If you had,
um,

744
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,143
a bodybuilder for instance,
cause they've got a lot of muscle mass 

745
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,280
but they're not using,
does that make sense?

746
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,800
So why aren't they using it?
Because it's,

747
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,980
it's strength is functional.
So they've got all this muscle mass,

748
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,053
but they're not recruiting it.
They've not actually trained strength 

749
00:29:51,071 --> 00:29:51,904
because strength is neuro muscular.
So when a bodybuilder does like high 

750
00:29:54,911 --> 00:29:55,744
repetitions,
and what was the type of load that you 

751
00:29:57,881 --> 00:29:58,980
were calling that?
How they were,

752
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:03,550
that was causing hypertrophy range.
So that's metabolic stress,

753
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,090
metabolic stress.
So just a sheer number of sets.

754
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:07,953
Yeah.
Just constant repetitions over and over 

755
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,850
and over again with not that high await.
Yes.

756
00:30:12,851 --> 00:30:13,630
Yeah.
And that's meant about,

757
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:16,560
but then mechanical tension is when,
um,

758
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,433
it's more powerlifting us.
So there's your difference between the 

759
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:22,030
two.
So the reason being is met.

760
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,093
So when you start looking at mechanical 
tension that might produce an athlete 

761
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,320
who has a smaller strength deficit,
right?

762
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,630
So when again,
using you as an example,

763
00:30:31,631 --> 00:30:32,464
if there was a smaller strength deficit 
between what you could voluntarily leg 

764
00:30:38,021 --> 00:30:39,970
press in a leg extension after 
extension,

765
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,880
and then involuntary,
there's a smaller deficit,

766
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,610
it would like it,
I would have likened it to,

767
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:46,061
okay,
Joe,

768
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:46,894
you have this much muscle mass,
but you're using a lot of your 

769
00:30:49,001 --> 00:30:50,770
potential.
You're using it already.

770
00:30:50,771 --> 00:30:55,300
It's almost like you've got a formula 
one car with a huge engine,

771
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,940
but you're using it to its full extent.
You know?

772
00:30:57,941 --> 00:30:58,774
And,
and this is why I'm going off on a 

773
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:00,874
slight tangent here,
but this is why when you start looking 

774
00:31:02,441 --> 00:31:03,274
at bodybuilding centric work,
so this idea of increasing muscular 

775
00:31:06,161 --> 00:31:06,994
hypertrophy,
it can be a good thing when you 

776
00:31:08,921 --> 00:31:13,921
understand that strength deficit.
So you might have an athlete who you go,

777
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,090
okay,
you have a small strength deficits,

778
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,953
very small.

779
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:17,823
So for the muscle mass that you have,
you're using it to its absolute full 

780
00:31:21,281 --> 00:31:22,114
potential.
It's like you have a very small car but 

781
00:31:24,191 --> 00:31:25,024
you are just pushing down the 
accelerator so hard and it can't go 

782
00:31:27,371 --> 00:31:28,780
anymore.
It's just red line.

783
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:29,763
Exactly.
So the option that we have is to 

784
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:32,074
increase the size of the car.
The option we have is increased the 

785
00:31:33,671 --> 00:31:34,540
size,
your muscle mass.

786
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,430
In some sense it does.
Yeah,

787
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,980
it does.
Um,

788
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,033
what kind of training were you doing to 
increase your capacity for work while 

789
00:31:43,841 --> 00:31:45,700
maintaining the mass?
Yeah,

790
00:31:45,701 --> 00:31:46,534
and this,
this guy's that is a bit of a strange 

791
00:31:48,071 --> 00:31:48,904
story.
So this goes back to something I always 

792
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,920
call.
Um,

793
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,330
you know,
horsepower programming,

794
00:31:52,331 --> 00:31:54,760
which I think is,
it's so often lost now.

795
00:31:54,761 --> 00:31:55,594
I think training is very specific when 
you're going to the gym or you're 

796
00:31:57,581 --> 00:31:58,450
training for strength,
speed,

797
00:31:58,451 --> 00:31:59,230
stamina.

798
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:04,110
Whereas horsepower programming I almost 
borrowed from Soviet Union principles,

799
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:07,480
you start looking at a general physical 
preparedness as it was,

800
00:32:07,481 --> 00:32:08,314
as it was known.
And this is this just idea of you take 

801
00:32:11,051 --> 00:32:11,884
an athlete's only a younger athlete and 
you're trying to increase their work 

802
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:18,760
capacity by nonspecific movements.
So you'll get at,

803
00:32:18,761 --> 00:32:20,840
you're an athlete,
you're handed you a magic,

804
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,240
okay,
you're young,

805
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:25,930
a kid just growing up and your parents 
hand you to me,

806
00:32:25,931 --> 00:32:26,890
I'm your coach.
And I say,

807
00:32:26,891 --> 00:32:27,724
okay,
I don't know if Joe's going to be big 

808
00:32:29,711 --> 00:32:30,544
strong.
I don't know if he's gonna be able to 

809
00:32:31,271 --> 00:32:33,190
run far or fast.
I don't know.

810
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,440
So what we're going to do is just 
create,

811
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:38,230
increase your sort of neuromuscular 
efficiency and work capacity.

812
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:40,190
And so by doing

813
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,900
that,
it's kind of jumps,

814
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:45,140
throws nonspecific,
these natural movement patterns,

815
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,210
and we get you to do lots and lots of 
this.

816
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:48,643
What that's doing is work capacity,
your body's ability to positively 

817
00:32:51,351 --> 00:32:53,510
tolerate training and given an intensity
or duration.

818
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,160
And I think from the great British swim,
when a lot of people will say,

819
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,520
how was it that you are able to tolerate
those 12 hours a day?

820
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:05,000
The jellyfish things and everything.
It it for me,

821
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,070
one of the biggest things was going back
to,

822
00:33:07,071 --> 00:33:09,050
and this is gonna sound so odd,
but I um,

823
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,420
I ran a marathon pulling a car,
uh,

824
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,580
three,
three years ago I think now.

825
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,503
Um,
and so that is almost the perfect 

826
00:33:16,341 --> 00:33:19,400
embodiment of horsepower programming in 
that,

827
00:33:19,401 --> 00:33:22,880
that shear stress on the body.
But it's not a specific skill.

828
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:25,070
When you say you run a marathon behind a
car,

829
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,230
pulling a car,
pulling a car,

830
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,550
pulling out in front of a car.

831
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,900
Yeah.
Not behind a car.

832
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:30,621
No.
Yeah.

833
00:33:30,621 --> 00:33:33,470
So it was um,
you pull the car and ran a marathon.

834
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:38,680
What the fuck do they said?
Yeah,

835
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:43,190
I seem so normal.
That's what's so confusing to me.

836
00:33:43,191 --> 00:33:44,024
Like if I met you,
there's something about a lot of these 

837
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,500
endurance people.
Well how,

838
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:50,900
I guess not Courtney Courtney door.
Walter,

839
00:33:50,901 --> 00:33:55,901
she's so carefree and silly,
but your very loose and relaxed.

840
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:58,190
I always considered like those people 
are dark.

841
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:01,640
There's some darkness to those extreme 
endurance athletes.

842
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:02,563
Yeah.
There's darkness that they're running 

843
00:34:04,431 --> 00:34:06,800
from some darkness.
You know what I mean?

844
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:07,970
Now I do,

845
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:11,490
I've had this conversation with a few 
people cause they said something similar

846
00:34:11,491 --> 00:34:12,690
and I think it's,
um,

847
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:13,681
I mean,
you know,

848
00:34:13,681 --> 00:34:14,514
to slightly go off on another tangent 
here cause I think we've covered the 

849
00:34:16,261 --> 00:34:18,990
physical aspect and,
and work capacity,

850
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,130
the which,
which I've addressed.

851
00:34:20,131 --> 00:34:20,964
But I think,
and this is one thing I genuine just 

852
00:34:23,221 --> 00:34:25,830
wanting to almost quiz you on and get 
your thoughts on this is uh,

853
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,980
certainly the Frat,
the great British swim,

854
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:34,410
it subjected my body to a fatigue like 
I've never experienced before.

855
00:34:34,411 --> 00:34:37,620
It was just yes,
sleep deprivation,

856
00:34:37,621 --> 00:34:39,750
just ligaments,
tendons in my shoulders.

857
00:34:39,751 --> 00:34:41,490
Just wondering what's going on.
And um,

858
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,570
for me,
your most developer,

859
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,663
a split personality in that,
there's times when I would quite often 

860
00:34:48,331 --> 00:34:50,790
say you need to swim with a smile 
because you know,

861
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,713
it's 157 days if you're stressed or it's
like a marathon where you grit your 

862
00:34:55,081 --> 00:34:56,430
teeth and you try and get through it.

863
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,320
Um,
I think we're very aware that,

864
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,203
you know,
the body is this complex biochemical 

865
00:35:00,481 --> 00:35:02,520
organism and if you're stressed cortisol
levels,

866
00:35:02,521 --> 00:35:04,170
spike inflammation,
your immune system,

867
00:35:04,171 --> 00:35:06,090
everything's affected.
So for me,

868
00:35:06,091 --> 00:35:09,330
I was treating it not like a marathon.
I had to treat it,

869
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,580
swim with a smile,
you know,

870
00:35:11,581 --> 00:35:13,740
think this is,
this is life now.

871
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:14,603
Right?
Let's see.

872
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,120
Um,
but then equally there were times when,

873
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,190
you know,
I wouldn't swim with a smile.

874
00:35:20,191 --> 00:35:21,510
It was just,
you know,

875
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,340
Korea vet can be being a great example.
You know,

876
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,050
I sent him,
he wasn't all that happy then.

877
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,090
And,
and for me,

878
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,810
it's those times when I say,
you've got to just get feral.

879
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:31,943
You know,
you've really just got to a good friend 

880
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:33,870
of mine,
you know,

881
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,340
back in,
back in England,

882
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,710
um,
ses trained,

883
00:35:37,711 --> 00:35:38,610
and he said to me,
Ross,

884
00:35:38,611 --> 00:35:40,560
your,
you're really nice guy and everything,

885
00:35:40,561 --> 00:35:42,210
but there's gonna be times when you just
need to,

886
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,530
you know,
no smiles and just get feral.

887
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:48,420
Which,
which I thinking about it an end,

888
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:51,960
cause I had 12 hours to think at bay.
I was mulling this over in my head.

889
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,000
Um,
for me,

890
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,880
it goes back to Tim noakes central 
governor theory.

891
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,490
Um,
looking at how fatigue is,

892
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:00,324
it is an emotionally driven state that 
we use to pull that physiological 

893
00:36:02,731 --> 00:36:03,630
handbrake.
So,

894
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,261
uh,
you know,

895
00:36:04,261 --> 00:36:06,690
for those listening sorta 60 miles into 
a marathon,

896
00:36:06,691 --> 00:36:08,220
you might be saying,
no way,

897
00:36:08,221 --> 00:36:09,650
I can't keep putting one foot in front 
of that.

898
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,503
There's no way.
And then all of a sudden 25 miles in 

899
00:36:12,661 --> 00:36:13,494
your family and friends are clapping you
and you get that second wind and you 

900
00:36:16,021 --> 00:36:17,640
start sprinting.
Um,

901
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:20,400
and for me,
looking at that,

902
00:36:20,401 --> 00:36:25,401
this sort of central governor theory,
I found that in complete exhaustion,

903
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,260
like when when you absolutely have 
nothing left,

904
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,870
you almost go into this feral state,
you know,

905
00:36:30,871 --> 00:36:31,560
so like,
uh,

906
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,600
like an like an injured dog,
you know,

907
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:35,640
where a lot of people will say,
Oh,

908
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,533
you know,
remember why you started to think of 

909
00:36:37,201 --> 00:36:38,340
your family and friends.

910
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,241
And I was like,
no,

911
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:39,600
no,
no.

912
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,470
I was at a level of fatigue where I 
wasn't thinking about,

913
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,910
you know,
family and friends.

914
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,380
It,
I was thinking almost,

915
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,840
you know,
maslow's hierarchy of needs,

916
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,450
where it starts with just food,
shelter,

917
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,343
oxygen.
I was at that sort of level where there 

918
00:36:55,411 --> 00:36:57,240
was clcs.
I mean,

919
00:36:57,241 --> 00:36:59,340
my next kind of healed now,
but you know,

920
00:36:59,341 --> 00:37:02,260
there was times when chafing on my neck,
my,

921
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:04,560
my tongue was falling apart.
It's fine now by the way,

922
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:07,650
Jay Thomas fire part my tongue from the 
salt,

923
00:37:07,651 --> 00:37:09,120
salt water.
Yeah.

924
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,170
Yeah.
And,

925
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,320
and falling apart on the house or it is 
what it's called,

926
00:37:13,321 --> 00:37:14,154
salt tongue.
And after 12 hours in the water every 

927
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:17,603
single day,
um,

928
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:18,483
your,
your tongue would essentially start to 

929
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:21,160
disintegrate.
So Jesus,

930
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,013
yeah.
No.

931
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,573
So I was,
I woke up and there was parts of my 

932
00:37:25,111 --> 00:37:28,920
tongue on my pillow.
And this is,

933
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:29,843
is there any concern of this is 
permanent or it was prominent at the 

934
00:37:32,221 --> 00:37:32,610
time?

935
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,200
Were you concerned?
Absolutely.

936
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:38,610
And I think that that's bad,
but that's what goes back to that,

937
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,773
that hierarchy of needs where you're not
thinking about family and friends or 

938
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,250
what motivates you and what you know,
you know,

939
00:37:44,251 --> 00:37:46,320
you're thinking,
I want to keep my tongue.

940
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:47,283
You know,
you're like,

941
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,240
man,
because no one has really,

942
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,000
has people have gone on long swims 
before?

943
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:57,450
But has anybody done six months?
I don't think so.

944
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,160
There there,
there's Ben La,

945
00:37:59,161 --> 00:37:59,994
compton,
the moment who's going across the 

946
00:38:00,481 --> 00:38:03,660
Pacific,
but he is using a snorkel.

947
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:06,750
So he kind of cleverly thought about 
that.

948
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:08,310
Whereas for me I thought,
no,

949
00:38:08,311 --> 00:38:12,030
this has to be done without properly.
Where you thinking about the guy who was

950
00:38:12,031 --> 00:38:14,910
just doing the restaurant and saying,
well if he did it,

951
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,100
fuck get done.
Well and this is it.

952
00:38:17,101 --> 00:38:19,200
Yeah,
it was wow.

953
00:38:19,201 --> 00:38:22,080
So yes and no that and it was at that 
point that I think,

954
00:38:22,081 --> 00:38:24,000
um,
you what you are feral,

955
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:28,680
you're just thinking I five one,
one arm in front of the other.

956
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,820
Keep going.
Keep moving.

957
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,773
Exactly.
That you are soldier pieces of your 

958
00:38:32,821 --> 00:38:33,654
tongue.
This is a video that you made or pieces 

959
00:38:35,591 --> 00:38:36,010
of your tongue.

960
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,320
We're falling apart.
Wow.

961
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:42,860
The fact of salt buildup on the tongue,
and this is on Ross's instagram was,

962
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:47,410
which is Ross.
E.

963
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:47,410
D.
G.

964
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:47,410
L.
E.

965
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,390
Y.
I put it up on my instagram too.

966
00:38:49,391 --> 00:38:51,910
I re retweeted or reposted one of your,
uh,

967
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,640
things to let people know about this.

968
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,030
Oh,
that is so nasty,

969
00:38:57,031 --> 00:38:59,370
dude.
You can see the taste buds on it.

970
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,190
That's how so was it fucking with your 
taste buds?

971
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,270
Oh yeah,
yeah.

972
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,120
The way you tasted things.
Oh yeah.

973
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,100
And that started to have an impact on 
you need the food as well.

974
00:39:08,101 --> 00:39:10,800
Cause I mean like Granola,
I was eating so much granola,

975
00:39:10,801 --> 00:39:15,110
but when that happened it's like rubbing
sandpaper on an icon.

976
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,871
Yeah,
right.

977
00:39:15,871 --> 00:39:18,480
He's the grit and the the oats.
Exactly.

978
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:21,300
So,
and that was how we had to just adapt on

979
00:39:21,301 --> 00:39:22,590
the day.
So it's during that,

980
00:39:22,591 --> 00:39:23,424
that video is great actually.
I mean that was in the cabin and I 

981
00:39:25,231 --> 00:39:27,480
remember just thinking like now I'm not 
thinking,

982
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,750
you know,
family and friends to,

983
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:30,990
to talk about those.
As you just said,

984
00:39:30,991 --> 00:39:32,580
those,
those darker moments.

985
00:39:32,581 --> 00:39:35,280
I think now it's very easy for me to be 
very grateful.

986
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,510
I'm warm sitting in the studio view.
There's,

987
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,090
there's no jellyfish,
but there's times that where,

988
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,140
you know,
it was dark with my neck as well.

989
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:46,490
I mean my neck was bad,
but we didn't actually catch that.

990
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,423
The moment was probably the worst on 
that where I went to bed with this open 

991
00:39:51,061 --> 00:39:53,010
wound from the wetsuit,
chafing basically.

992
00:39:53,011 --> 00:39:53,760
And,
um,

993
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,180
as I woke up,
the bedsheet had fused to my neck.

994
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,620
Oh.
So I just had to rip it off,

995
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:03,450
put it on the pus.
Jesus Christ.

996
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,163
Right.
And then you had to get in that salt 

997
00:40:09,101 --> 00:40:10,370
water,
which was the felt great.

998
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,330
Right?
Yeah.

999
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:15,350
Fuck man.
What was it like when you finished?

1000
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,830
What did it feel like when the last 
stroke,

1001
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,380
what did you got out of the water and 
you're like,

1002
00:40:21,381 --> 00:40:24,500
Holy Shit,
I just swam for six months.

1003
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,300
It was,
yeah,

1004
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,133
it was,
it was so strange because when we left 

1005
00:40:27,161 --> 00:40:29,590
in June,
we came back obviously to the same point

1006
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,360
and we left in the British summer and 
everyone was on the beach and,

1007
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,433
and then our came back round.
People are putting up Christmas 

1008
00:40:35,831 --> 00:40:40,480
decorations and I was like,
I had been gone for so long at sea.

1009
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:45,550
It was just so crazy.
How many days was it a total?

1010
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,030
157.
Oh my God,

1011
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:51,130
that is so insane.
It just is so much change in,

1012
00:40:51,131 --> 00:40:51,550
Oh,
here.

1013
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,181
Yeah,
here we go.

1014
00:40:52,181 --> 00:40:54,280
That was the finished.
So this is swimming,

1015
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,320
but then this is your the or who are 
these people?

1016
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:58,510
These fucking hangers on following you 
around.

1017
00:40:58,511 --> 00:40:59,540
Pretend they did it too.

1018
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:07,450
So I felt that it was such a team 
effort.

1019
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:10,510
Those people are waiting for you.
My legs was so shaky,

1020
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:11,710
Joe,
at this point I'm thinking,

1021
00:41:11,711 --> 00:41:12,910
don't fall over.
Don't fall over.

1022
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,470
Wow.
Because it has,

1023
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:16,390
I mean this is the thing I think I 
stumbled in.

1024
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,730
Aluminum does such madness,
man.

1025
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:19,623
Yeah.
It's such a madness and you crossed the 

1026
00:41:21,251 --> 00:41:23,170
red bull finish line.
I've got a trident.

1027
00:41:23,171 --> 00:41:24,870
That was pretty cool.
Wow.

1028
00:41:24,871 --> 00:41:25,990
That's at home at the moment.
Oh,

1029
00:41:25,991 --> 00:41:27,520
they hooked you up?
Yeah.

1030
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,860
What's that made out of?
It was really sturdy.

1031
00:41:29,861 --> 00:41:32,130
I don't know.
I think it was like a bronx style thing,

1032
00:41:32,131 --> 00:41:36,950
but blue,
all these fucking phony do it with them.

1033
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,190
I said,
I was like,

1034
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,033
I feel that the way that it captured 
everyone's my age just only felt right 

1035
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,250
to do that.
Do you swim?

1036
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,300
Yes.
You do.

1037
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,390
Christina.
Pool come and get involved.

1038
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,260
I didn't even know about it.
You know how I found out about you?

1039
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:57,221
Because I was,
I,

1040
00:41:57,221 --> 00:41:58,054
I was reading on the Internet and I 
found out about it and I sent it to all 

1041
00:42:00,071 --> 00:42:02,590
my friends after sober October to show 
what pussies we were.

1042
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:03,843
I was like,
guys think what we did was hard and we 

1043
00:42:05,351 --> 00:42:08,800
did ain't shit.
I sent it to Tom and burden our,

1044
00:42:08,801 --> 00:42:09,634
and we were all just like fluff because 
whenever you hear about someone doing 

1045
00:42:13,331 --> 00:42:14,164
something crazy,
there's always someone who does 

1046
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:20,020
something far crazier to one up the 
crazy person.

1047
00:42:20,021 --> 00:42:22,390
And then it keeps going and going and 
going.

1048
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,510
Like there's a race that courtney doe,
Walter,

1049
00:42:25,511 --> 00:42:26,344
who's been a guest on the show before,
she won the Moab to 40 which is a 238 

1050
00:42:31,511 --> 00:42:34,180
mile race through the mobile APP 
mountains.

1051
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,030
And it's just an insane race.

1052
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,913
Not only did she win it,
she wanted it by more than 10 hours 

1053
00:42:39,731 --> 00:42:44,080
ahead of the second place guy when she's
just a fucking straight savage.

1054
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:48,730
So she recently entered a race and she 
came in second place and this race,

1055
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:49,863
they would run for four miles in an hour
and then they would stop when the hour 

1056
00:42:54,971 --> 00:42:55,804
was over.
They would stop and then when the next 

1057
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,700
hour started,
they would run another four miles,

1058
00:43:00,701 --> 00:43:03,910
like four point something miles.
And they do it for six days.

1059
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:05,343
That's crazy.
They did is still like the last man 

1060
00:43:06,401 --> 00:43:08,860
standing.
And then at the very end,

1061
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:10,540
one person one like,
it's like,

1062
00:43:10,541 --> 00:43:14,260
who's going to drop out last?
So they just kept doing it.

1063
00:43:14,261 --> 00:43:17,690
So the guy who created this race,
see if you can find anything on this guy

1064
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,593
because he's apparently very sadistic.
And his idea was that people run these 

1065
00:43:22,691 --> 00:43:26,530
100 mile races or a 50 mile race and if 
you just finish,

1066
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:28,180
you feel like a winner.
And he's like,

1067
00:43:28,181 --> 00:43:29,440
well bullshit.
He goes,

1068
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:30,274
there can't be a winner if,
if somebody comes in first place and 

1069
00:43:34,001 --> 00:43:35,950
then your your second place,
you're not the winner.

1070
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,480
It's like there's one winner.

1071
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,310
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1072
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,940
He's apparently chain smokes too.
He's amazing.

1073
00:43:42,941 --> 00:43:44,800
So this is the Berkeley marathons,
you know about this.

1074
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,680
Did you see last same guy he ran,
he created that race.

1075
00:43:47,681 --> 00:43:50,380
And this is another race he created.
He's amazing.

1076
00:43:50,381 --> 00:43:52,300
So did you see,
I think it was last year,

1077
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:53,940
Jamie,
is it right then?

1078
00:43:53,941 --> 00:43:56,590
It's the Berkeley Marathon.
What does the Berkeley Barkley,

1079
00:43:56,591 --> 00:43:58,780
Matt Barkley,
Berkley or Barkley,

1080
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,110
the Barkley,
the one that nobody could figure out how

1081
00:44:02,111 --> 00:44:05,560
to Mark Lee at the Barkley guy with the 
weird one.

1082
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:08,200
And I think it was if you searched his 
jamie's well,

1083
00:44:08,201 --> 00:44:10,600
I think it was last year or the year 
before,

1084
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:11,643
I believe it's the 24 hours or 40 hours,
but the guy missed out on finishing it 

1085
00:44:15,491 --> 00:44:19,900
by,
I think it was a minute rant and then at

1086
00:44:19,901 --> 00:44:20,734
the end and you see him on the floor,
he's absolutely devastated and he 

1087
00:44:22,931 --> 00:44:25,420
didn't,
he may take a wrong turn somewhere along

1088
00:44:25,421 --> 00:44:28,990
the line cause it's really difficult to 
follow that path.

1089
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,520
Yeah,
admirably.

1090
00:44:30,521 --> 00:44:32,220
He just got and he shook his hand

1091
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,850
and just said,
I just want to thank you.

1092
00:44:33,851 --> 00:44:35,070
You know,
for that he said sometimes,

1093
00:44:35,071 --> 00:44:36,990
you know the Barkley Barkley Marathon 
wins,

1094
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:39,640
but you know that that takes something 
different.

1095
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,033
Well,
definitely takes something different to 

1096
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,840
see a final,
if I'm correct in how they do it.

1097
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,690
I retweeted the courtney daughter water 
one.

1098
00:44:48,691 --> 00:44:49,524
I retweeted it from Courtney where it 
says it's like getting punched in the 

1099
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:56,130
face very softly over and over and over 
again.

1100
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,240
Yeah,
that's exactly,

1101
00:44:57,241 --> 00:44:58,650
yeah.
I compare it to being punched and put it

1102
00:44:58,660 --> 00:44:59,493
up.
Put the article up version of the 

1103
00:45:02,431 --> 00:45:03,880
article.
I don't know if it's the exact one.

1104
00:45:03,881 --> 00:45:04,381
Yeah,
yeah,

1105
00:45:04,381 --> 00:45:07,080
that's exactly it.
So if you scroll down,

1106
00:45:07,081 --> 00:45:10,560
you'll see the,
the the specifications.

1107
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:13,860
Yeah.
Yeah.

1108
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:16,373
And this is what I find amazing because 
then it becomes about something 

1109
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:19,584
completely different.
I mean we were just talking now about 

1110
00:45:21,211 --> 00:45:24,250
Kyc Shogi and the two hour marathon,
but it's like if you pick,

1111
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,480
put Kip chokey into this,
you know who's going to win?

1112
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:32,610
It says they had an hour to complete the
4.1667

1113
00:45:32,611 --> 00:45:33,444
mile loop and then they finished within 
15 minutes to spare the bell clangs 

1114
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,930
again,
it's 7:40

1115
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:43,230
AM they run it again and then at 8:48
AM they run it again.

1116
00:45:43,231 --> 00:45:48,231
At nine 40 they were running again.
So every hour you run this 4.1667

1117
00:45:49,411 --> 00:45:50,244
mile loop.
And then the bell just keeps clanging 

1118
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:57,270
for forever.
Why do you,

1119
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,720
why do you think there's more people 
doing these events now?

1120
00:46:00,721 --> 00:46:01,554
Well,
I think it's the same thing as 

1121
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:04,823
everything else.
The same thing as if you buy a car 

1122
00:46:07,981 --> 00:46:10,200
today,
you wanted to accelerate from zero to 60

1123
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:11,720
in two and a half seconds.
Yeah.

1124
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,690
A few years ago that was unheard of.
If you buy a computer today,

1125
00:46:15,691 --> 00:46:20,691
you want it to be 3.8
gigahertz and five terabyte hard drive.

1126
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:24,330
And that's,
it's the same every year.

1127
00:46:24,331 --> 00:46:25,164
We want improvements.
And I think when you hear someone's 

1128
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,450
going to run a 100 mile race,
you go there,

1129
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,353
yeah,
that's cute.

1130
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:33,210
Uh,
but I'm gonna run 200 miles.

1131
00:46:33,211 --> 00:46:34,430
And they're like,
that's not even possible.

1132
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,020
The same as the four minute mile,
right.

1133
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:37,590
Someone runs a 200 miles.
You're like,

1134
00:46:37,591 --> 00:46:38,424
Holy Shit,
I can't believe a guy rants for three 

1135
00:46:39,811 --> 00:46:41,160
days.
You were in 200 miles.

1136
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,890
And then someone like courtney comes 
along,

1137
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:43,920
goes,
I'm going to do it in two days.

1138
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:46,620
And then she runs,
she runs it in two days.

1139
00:46:46,621 --> 00:46:47,454
And then someone,
they're talking about now doing a 500 

1140
00:46:49,771 --> 00:46:53,100
mile ultra marathon.
Yeah.

1141
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:54,750
But,
and what I find amazing,

1142
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:56,850
who,
what's the athlete look like?

1143
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,260
Who completes that?
Do you know what I mean?

1144
00:46:58,261 --> 00:46:59,910
He's,
and he's very thin.

1145
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:02,520
She's very light and very thin and you 
know,

1146
00:47:02,521 --> 00:47:06,600
she's not the type of person that would 
win a regular marathon.

1147
00:47:06,601 --> 00:47:08,550
This was what it was interesting.
My friend Cam Haynes,

1148
00:47:08,551 --> 00:47:10,510
who also runs these,
he ran the,

1149
00:47:10,511 --> 00:47:11,221
uh,
he's quite,

1150
00:47:11,221 --> 00:47:12,000
he's pretty Jack.

1151
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:12,833
Yeah,
he works,

1152
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,170
he lifts a lot,
but he cuts a lot of body weight when he

1153
00:47:16,171 --> 00:47:17,150
does those.
Okay.

1154
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,620
But the way he does it is he's a hard 
man.

1155
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,260
He's what I was talking about,
like the speed have darkness.

1156
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:23,880
Yay.
He's got some darkness.

1157
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,390
He just like,
he'll burn 3000 calories,

1158
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,253
eat 2000.
And so he'll force his body to eat 

1159
00:47:30,221 --> 00:47:31,100
itself.
Right.

1160
00:47:31,101 --> 00:47:34,420
And so he drops down to the hundred and 
60 something pound range.

1161
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:35,583
And then that's what he likes to weigh.
When he normally walks around like one 

1162
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:39,580
85,
it's pretty built.

1163
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,103
But then he drops way down.
He'll lose like 20 pounds of muscle 

1164
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:45,670
cars.
He's always lean.

1165
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,713
He's not losing body fat.
He's just forcing his body to literally 

1166
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:52,540
eat itself just through mental 
toughness.

1167
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,393
But he's still quite big.
Even when he's tending up on the start 

1168
00:47:55,091 --> 00:47:55,690
line and he's lost that.

1169
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:58,240
He's still big for a year for an 
endurance athlete.

1170
00:47:58,241 --> 00:47:59,074
Amazing.
But maybe that's one of the reasons why 

1171
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:02,660
he doesn't win these things.
He comes in like third fourth you mean?

1172
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:03,821
And also,
you know,

1173
00:48:03,821 --> 00:48:07,000
he hasn't been doing it as long as them 
and he's 51 years old now,

1174
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:11,560
but he's an animal man and this is just 
that,

1175
00:48:11,561 --> 00:48:15,910
that kind of mental fortitude that it 
takes to do one of those things where to

1176
00:48:15,911 --> 00:48:16,744
do what you did.
It's a very unusual kind of drive and 

1177
00:48:20,051 --> 00:48:20,884
people are very excited by that drive 
and they're very intrigued by it and 

1178
00:48:24,761 --> 00:48:27,970
it's very attractive.
It's very attractive to attempt to do.

1179
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:28,804
It's very attractive to pay attention to
and watch cause everyone knows how 

1180
00:48:31,571 --> 00:48:34,240
difficult he said.
It's undeniably difficult.

1181
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:35,403
Like if someone says,
you talked to someone who doesn't know 

1182
00:48:37,121 --> 00:48:38,680
how to run it all does,
they don't do anything.

1183
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,880
They just sit on the couch.
You Go,

1184
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:40,571
hey man,
get up,

1185
00:48:40,571 --> 00:48:42,070
get up.
We're going to run three miles.

1186
00:48:42,071 --> 00:48:44,680
Like fuck.
At the end of that three miles,

1187
00:48:44,681 --> 00:48:47,050
they will collapse the lay down their 
back.

1188
00:48:47,051 --> 00:48:51,820
Their heart would be pounding the chest 
to be heaving so they know that's hard.

1189
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:54,970
Everybody knows that's hard.
Everybody at one point in their life has

1190
00:48:54,971 --> 00:48:55,804
run until they were exhausted,
whether it's 500 yards or five miles or 

1191
00:48:59,891 --> 00:49:02,620
whatever it was every from when you were
a kid.

1192
00:49:02,621 --> 00:49:04,210
There's always been a moment where we 
tested ourselves,

1193
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:08,890
so we're familiar with that feeling of 
not being able to go on.

1194
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:09,783
So when they see a guy like you who went
through that feeling for six fucking 

1195
00:49:14,261 --> 00:49:16,060
months,
or was it five months total?

1196
00:49:16,061 --> 00:49:17,710
Five months,
five months,

1197
00:49:17,711 --> 00:49:21,100
man.
Five months is an insane amount of time.

1198
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:26,630
It is now upon the June,
July,

1199
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:28,870
August,
September,

1200
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:28,870
October,
November.

1201
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:31,810
You're into the sixth fucking month when
you stop.

1202
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:33,590
That's insane.
But,

1203
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,200
but what you just said,
they're like,

1204
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:36,063
do you think,
and this is again cause I had 12 hours 

1205
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:38,644
to think every day.
Do you think is unusual or do you think 

1206
00:49:43,061 --> 00:49:47,020
that we now think is unusual because 
society has got real comfortable,

1207
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,083
you know,
and I maintained that stuff that I was 

1208
00:49:50,411 --> 00:49:53,260
doing with salt 10 and everything 
ancestors.

1209
00:49:53,261 --> 00:49:54,580
Do you not think they would have just 
thought,

1210
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:56,140
yeah that's,
that's just Monday.

1211
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:57,060
You know,
just,

1212
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,900
I don't think anybody ever thought that 
was just Monday.

1213
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:00,213
No,
I don't think they would have forced 

1214
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:01,564
themselves to do that because there's no
biological or evolutionary need to do 

1215
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:05,584
that.
It's not like you could swim for 12 

1216
00:50:07,661 --> 00:50:08,494
hours a day and get across the channel 
and get to a place where there's better 

1217
00:50:10,451 --> 00:50:11,940
fruit.
They know that are,

1218
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:13,450
I don't think our ancestors ever did 
that.

1219
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:15,430
I think.
I definitely think they did.

1220
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,690
What does that type of a hunting,
there's,

1221
00:50:18,691 --> 00:50:20,800
there's actually a term for it.
Sharon's hunting.

1222
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:21,663
Well they run an animal down,
I don't think it's called endurance 

1223
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:24,970
hunting.
I think it's,

1224
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:27,920
there's another term for it,
but they will literally,

1225
00:50:27,921 --> 00:50:30,740
like if you take an antelope,
they don't have sweat glands,

1226
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:31,883
so they can run far faster than us,
but it comes a point in time when they 

1227
00:50:33,891 --> 00:50:34,724
overheat.
So if you just stay on them persistence 

1228
00:50:37,161 --> 00:50:38,990
hunting,
that's okay.

1229
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,940
I named it right when you pulled it up.
Damn.

1230
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:44,900
Um,
persistence hunting is in,

1231
00:50:44,901 --> 00:50:45,734
you see it in these,
a lot of these African men who go on to 

1232
00:50:48,681 --> 00:50:51,620
be phenomenal endurance runners.
I mean,

1233
00:50:51,621 --> 00:50:52,454
they win marathons left and right,
and his particular parts of Africa that 

1234
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:59,330
produce incredible runners and they 
think a lot.

1235
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:00,363
There was a really,
there's an cut and run is a fantastic 

1236
00:51:04,011 --> 00:51:04,844
episode of radio lab that details these 
men from this one certain part in 

1237
00:51:09,321 --> 00:51:09,710
Africa.

1238
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:12,020
I forget where it is,
but see if you pull that up.

1239
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:13,340
But this,
uh,

1240
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:14,413
this episode detailed the horrific 
circumcision rituals that these men had 

1241
00:51:19,671 --> 00:51:23,320
to endure where they cut their Dick and,
uh,

1242
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,163
they,
they stick a stick through it and then 

1243
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,590
they make them crawl through thorns 
naked,

1244
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,470
right?
Yeah.

1245
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:30,260
So I sold it.
There's a guy a back in,

1246
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:31,820
uh,
I think it's at Bruce Paris.

1247
00:51:31,821 --> 00:51:32,654
He's an adventurer.
He has done everything you can think of 

1248
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:38,330
every tribal initiation.
And that's the one that he refused to do

1249
00:51:38,331 --> 00:51:39,164
it for him.
Keeping Dick tact dealt those crazy 

1250
00:51:41,541 --> 00:51:42,374
guys.
Cut Your Dick.

1251
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:43,453
The sand or the oldest inhabitants of 
southern Africa where they have lived 

1252
00:51:46,221 --> 00:51:47,900
for almost 20,000
years.

1253
00:51:47,901 --> 00:51:50,600
The term San is commonly used to refer 
to a diverse group.

1254
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:53,290
Diverse group of hunter gatherers living
in South Africa.

1255
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:54,143
Share historical linguistic connections.
Many now except the term Bushman or 

1256
00:51:58,821 --> 00:51:59,330
sand.

1257
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:00,990
Is that,
that's bushmen hunting.

1258
00:52:00,991 --> 00:52:04,890
Is that from the radio lab thing?
That's what they call themselves.

1259
00:52:04,891 --> 00:52:07,190
You see article here,
which I would imagine,

1260
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:08,690
yeah.
Is it the same?

1261
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:12,140
But is that the same with the uh,
the horrible circumcision ritual?

1262
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:14,010
I'll double check.
Yeah,

1263
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:15,470
the hall,
it's fucking horrible.

1264
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,780
But they were arguing in the,
the,

1265
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,200
when they were discussing it and one of 
the guys who was on and who had actually

1266
00:52:21,201 --> 00:52:23,420
been through it and now I believe he 
lives,

1267
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:25,460
he lives,
maybe he lives in America,

1268
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:28,700
but he was saying he would never have 
his children go through that.

1269
00:52:28,701 --> 00:52:31,010
But he,
but it made him who he is.

1270
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,780
And the idea was that not only are these
guys physically gifted,

1271
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:37,093
but they also have unbelievable,
unbelievable pain tolerance and mental 

1272
00:52:41,931 --> 00:52:42,764
endurance and just mental toughness.
And that this is one of the reasons why 

1273
00:52:45,471 --> 00:52:46,304
they become so successful is that the 
ability to push a pace for two plus 

1274
00:52:50,781 --> 00:52:51,614
miles or whatever it is,
their marathon time is not just 

1275
00:52:53,901 --> 00:52:57,650
dependent upon their physical ability,
but also dependent upon their ability to

1276
00:52:57,651 --> 00:53:00,630
endure pain and to force themselves 
past,

1277
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:02,043
you know,
anyone could kind of trot along at a 

1278
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,780
really leisurely pace and it's not 
painful,

1279
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:07,840
but if you're going to hard,
no,

1280
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,320
you're really going hard.

1281
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:11,720
This is the radio lab.
This Kenya.

1282
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:12,650
Yeah,
it's the,

1283
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:13,551
yeah.
Cut.

1284
00:53:13,551 --> 00:53:15,380
Pogie I think is,
ah,

1285
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:18,350
here we go.
So,

1286
00:53:18,351 --> 00:53:20,060
um,
before you,

1287
00:53:20,061 --> 00:53:21,410
uh,
I mean,

1288
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:23,000
well I've,
I've kind of described it,

1289
00:53:23,001 --> 00:53:25,830
but they describe it even more detail

1290
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:27,520
in the podcast.
It's,

1291
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:30,150
that almost crosses over to,
I mean,

1292
00:53:30,151 --> 00:53:30,984
again,
I'm not advocating what you just 

1293
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,900
genitalia mutilation,
I'm not advocating that.

1294
00:53:37,901 --> 00:53:41,580
But there's that idea of adversity 
training that like if you're ever in the

1295
00:53:41,581 --> 00:53:41,971
gym,
he's like,

1296
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:43,290
what you training?
And it's just like strength,

1297
00:53:43,291 --> 00:53:45,300
what you're training speed.
And this is why,

1298
00:53:45,301 --> 00:53:46,134
you know,
I'm a huge fan of Wim Hoff because so 

1299
00:53:47,371 --> 00:53:50,340
often what he's doing when he's 
submerged in ice cold,

1300
00:53:50,341 --> 00:53:51,270
it's like,
well I'm training my cup.

1301
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,290
Hilary's,
yeah.

1302
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,550
What do you mean you're training your 
cup?

1303
00:53:53,551 --> 00:53:55,920
Hillary's and it's,
these were atrophying,

1304
00:53:55,921 --> 00:53:59,400
these age old inbuilt mechanisms.
So again,

1305
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,470
I'm not advocating,
you know,

1306
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:06,300
what general,
but do you remember king tolerance,

1307
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:07,523
teaching tolerance?
Do you think that I that's maybe 

1308
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:09,570
missing,
I mean,

1309
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:12,030
again,
looking at mma like maybe that you,

1310
00:54:12,031 --> 00:54:13,360
you see,
you know,

1311
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,690
whether it's uh,
you know,

1312
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,120
moo tie and they're like kicking trees 
and stuff.

1313
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:19,140
Yeah.
Granted that's,

1314
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,610
you know,
making denser bones and stuff.

1315
00:54:20,611 --> 00:54:22,740
But do you think there's that element as
well?

1316
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:24,520
And when you look at,
um,

1317
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:26,940
what was it?
Um,

1318
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:28,523
I forgot what it was now,
but you just start looking at just 

1319
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:33,780
putting people in high stress situations
just to see how they're going to cope.

1320
00:54:33,781 --> 00:54:37,020
Like John Fit.
He was like notorious for letting people

1321
00:54:37,021 --> 00:54:40,590
almost try and submit him and then they 
tie themselves out.

1322
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,120
He was just completely calm.
And then

1323
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:46,840
that really depends on who's choking 
you.

1324
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:50,650
Cause Josh Kirkman choked him completely
unconscious.

1325
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,460
Okay.
Okay.

1326
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,031
Yeah,
yeah.

1327
00:54:52,031 --> 00:54:54,490
You know,
Berchmans got a hell of a guillotine and

1328
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:55,863
John Fitch shot in on them and Berkman 
caught them and the good team to sleep 

1329
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:00,950
and the first round,
right.

1330
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:02,170
I think it,
there's,

1331
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:04,270
there's guys that can just put you to 
sleep.

1332
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:04,980
Right.
Okay.

1333
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:09,010
If you think that you can get away with 
that shit with like a Marcello Garcia,

1334
00:55:09,011 --> 00:55:10,780
you're going to wake up going,
what happened?

1335
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:11,990
Okay.
Yeah.

1336
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:15,250
Okay.
Most guys won't be able to choke you.

1337
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:17,030
So to that point,
you know,

1338
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:19,520
and again,
I'm catching up on 157 days.

1339
00:55:19,521 --> 00:55:20,354
If you have c in his life,
it was actually out at sea with the 

1340
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:23,690
Mcgregor and could beep.
But on that note,

1341
00:55:23,691 --> 00:55:26,630
do you think he tapped premature?
Do you think there's not asleep?

1342
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:28,053
Mcgregor went to sleep.

1343
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:29,310
Oh,
that in that fight,

1344
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:32,880
I thought you meant John Fishing net 
crank,

1345
00:55:32,881 --> 00:55:34,190
right?
No,

1346
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,390
he did not tap premature.
Um,

1347
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,900
he did not defend it though.
K,

1348
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,380
here's the deal.
He was done.

1349
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,290
He was beaten down.
Khabib fucked him up.

1350
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:46,530
Could be smashed him.
But there was a lot of people that don't

1351
00:55:46,531 --> 00:55:48,630
train and this was very frustrating to 
me.

1352
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,710
Like there are as many people that don't
train that think that that was something

1353
00:55:52,711 --> 00:55:55,830
that you shouldn't tap to there.
They're out of their fucking mind.

1354
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:57,900
Okay.
That is what's called a fulcrum Cho.

1355
00:55:57,930 --> 00:55:59,060
That's okay.
It's,

1356
00:55:59,061 --> 00:56:02,130
it's not necessarily a choke,
but it is.

1357
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:02,993
It chokes you,
but it really feels like you're fucking 

1358
00:56:05,071 --> 00:56:05,904
head's going to pop off.
What he's doing is he's wrapping around 

1359
00:56:08,551 --> 00:56:11,010
the face and you don't have to even go 
under the jaw.

1360
00:56:11,011 --> 00:56:11,844
You can get it on the chin,
especially if you're as strong as could 

1361
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:14,300
bead.

1362
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:18,840
Then you clamp your hands together and 
you're pressing your forearm against his

1363
00:56:18,841 --> 00:56:19,674
back.
So you've got this and you've got the 

1364
00:56:20,941 --> 00:56:23,190
forum against his back and you're doing 
this.

1365
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:27,210
Just leave his fucking head.
It's just like it's,

1366
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:30,520
and Khabib is so strong.
His Greg,

1367
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:31,383
he's been grappling since he was a baby.
All of his muscles are designed to 

1368
00:56:35,471 --> 00:56:36,304
squeeze and crush smash and he gets a 
hold of your neck in that position and 

1369
00:56:41,081 --> 00:56:44,020
he's got that forearm pressed against 
your back.

1370
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:47,440
See if you can find an image of the 
actual submission.

1371
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:49,930
You could really clearly see what he's 
doing.

1372
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,033
And then there was a video where dean 
lister and my friend Hans Molan camp 

1373
00:56:54,521 --> 00:56:55,354
described it as pulling that up and it's
been taken off instagram for that video 

1374
00:56:58,750 --> 00:56:59,583
to Hahn's Molin Camp Dean lister video.
Well maybe someone to re posted it and 

1375
00:57:03,551 --> 00:57:04,930
that link is gone,
but yeah.

1376
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,300
Huh.
Um,

1377
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:10,540
did you tech Dean listers?
That's so weird.

1378
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:14,290
Wonder why anybody would take that down.
Anyway,

1379
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,540
there's guys who could fuck your face up
without even going under the neck.

1380
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,430
A good example.
Here's another good example.

1381
00:57:21,431 --> 00:57:23,190
Just pull this up.
You got it.

1382
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:24,580
Okay.
The one from right after the fight,

1383
00:57:24,581 --> 00:57:25,820
but he's still describing it.
Oh,

1384
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:26,681
okay.
Oh,

1385
00:57:26,681 --> 00:57:27,940
this is perfect.
This is perfect.

1386
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:31,330
So Dean lister,
who's a world champion,

1387
00:57:31,331 --> 00:57:34,450
Brazilian jujitsu black belt,
as legit as it gets,

1388
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,580
and this is my friend Hahn's Moline 
camp.

1389
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:40,030
He's also Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt
and see,

1390
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,800
see,
this is exactly what could be.

1391
00:57:41,801 --> 00:57:42,634
Did see how it's forearm is pressed 
against the back and the arm is under 

1392
00:57:45,881 --> 00:57:46,990
the chin.
See,

1393
00:57:46,991 --> 00:57:49,780
the differences with Dean is doing,
he can't even help himself.

1394
00:57:49,781 --> 00:57:53,530
He's immediately putting his arms,
his hands on the arm that's choking him.

1395
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,640
That's what you're supposed to do.

1396
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,250
Now,
if you look at what connor did,

1397
00:57:57,490 --> 00:58:01,390
Conard just waited until he couldn't 
take it anymore and tapped.

1398
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:01,870
Right?
Right.

1399
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:05,110
When you see conor,
both of his arms are down,

1400
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:08,380
he's getting his neck crank and he 
doesn't do this.

1401
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:09,573
That's what you're supposed to do.
He's supposed to do two on one and then 

1402
00:58:11,711 --> 00:58:12,610
you dropped out.
Like,

1403
00:58:12,611 --> 00:58:14,170
look at this,
see what he's doing there.

1404
00:58:14,171 --> 00:58:16,540
He's tapping.
But see where his left arm,

1405
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:19,900
his left arm should not this you.
You can't,

1406
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,011
you can't do that.
See,

1407
00:58:21,011 --> 00:58:23,980
that is a perfect example of the fulcrum
choke.

1408
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,310
See how he's doing that?
Pressing his forearm against the back,

1409
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,080
squeezing the head.
It's,

1410
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:31,270
it's a neck crank.
It's a choke.

1411
00:58:31,271 --> 00:58:34,420
There's a lot of shit going on there.
It doesn't have to be under the chin.

1412
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:37,210
It could just be on your face and you're
going to get fucked up.

1413
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:42,540
So all those folks out there that were 
saying that it wasn't a choke need to go

1414
00:58:43,211 --> 00:58:44,044
have someone apply that to them.
They need to start training Jujitsu and 

1415
00:58:47,081 --> 00:58:47,914
stop fucking talking about MMA 
submissions cause they don't die that 

1416
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:55,210
you're going to tap bitch.
Don't say you're not going to tap.

1417
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,490
You get a fucking tap.
Right.

1418
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:59,470
Not everybody's going to tap from that 
because other people,

1419
00:58:59,471 --> 00:59:00,304
unlike connor,
are going to be better at defending 

1420
00:59:01,361 --> 00:59:03,790
that.
They're going to get like you get a hold

1421
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:04,624
of a worldclass Brazilian Jiu Jitsu 
black belt who's also an MMA fighter 

1422
00:59:07,811 --> 00:59:09,700
like um,
like vinny magallanes.

1423
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,700
He's going to grab a hold of that.
He's going to defend properly.

1424
00:59:12,701 --> 00:59:15,280
He's going to adjust.
He's going to try to get out of that.

1425
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,740
He might have to tap if someone gets him
in it.

1426
00:59:17,741 --> 00:59:19,630
I mean he people tap,
but he's,

1427
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:22,610
he's not going to just have one arm 
posted.

1428
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:24,770
That's just not the right way to handle 
it.

1429
00:59:24,771 --> 00:59:26,510
But I think that's because connor had 
eaten

1430
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:29,340
bombs when I was about to I,
so that's all technical.

1431
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:31,650
So you,
so there's that almost as a,

1432
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:32,970
as a,
I don't know,

1433
00:59:32,971 --> 00:59:34,830
like a continuum.
There's technical,

1434
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:36,570
which you've just,
you didn't bring it.

1435
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:37,830
And then,
and again I should point out,

1436
00:59:37,831 --> 00:59:38,311
you know,
again,

1437
00:59:38,311 --> 00:59:40,200
I'm a complete layman when it comes to a
mixed martial arts,

1438
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:43,590
but I find it fascinating the,
this adversity training aspects.

1439
00:59:43,591 --> 00:59:47,660
So you were just saying he was eating 
bombs before that would have,

1440
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:50,080
would it have helped you know that if he
wasn't,

1441
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:51,370
do you know what I mean?
Where,

1442
00:59:51,371 --> 00:59:52,380
where does it cross over from being,

1443
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:57,180
it would help if he wasn't as tired.
So like if that choke was applied during

1444
00:59:57,181 --> 01:00:01,080
the first few seconds or minutes of the 
first round,

1445
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:04,470
I think he probably would have had a 
good chance to survive.

1446
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,333
Okay.
Okay.

1447
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:07,770
What's going on,
put on dean lister as equal.

1448
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:09,570
Chokan is not,
it's not being done well,

1449
01:00:09,571 --> 01:00:11,460
but this is a diff,
this is not an exact,

1450
01:00:11,461 --> 01:00:13,500
you'll choke.
This is,

1451
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:16,420
this is a,
what this is is,

1452
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:20,520
I mean it's kind of an Ezekiel,
but see where his hand is.

1453
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:23,430
You got to really get underneath.
See his left hand.

1454
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:25,560
That left hand's got to go,
not just there.

1455
01:00:25,561 --> 01:00:26,394
It's got to go under the chin.
That's not good enough for a guy like 

1456
01:00:29,041 --> 01:00:29,851
dean.
You got,

1457
01:00:29,851 --> 01:00:30,684
I'll get now it's pretty fucking tight.
Now it's tight and he's got to get 

1458
01:00:33,331 --> 01:00:34,164
further and further.
And the further that left arm gets into 

1459
01:00:36,571 --> 01:00:37,650
jeans,
neck,

1460
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:39,450
the more more.

1461
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,490
There's going to be a possibility of him
choking.

1462
01:00:41,491 --> 01:00:45,030
But Dean has been fucking choked his 
whole life,

1463
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,193
which is,
but I do have to say that Josh Barnett 

1464
01:00:49,081 --> 01:00:49,914
bade him tap and Josh Barnett is like 
one of the few guys that's made dean 

1465
01:00:53,341 --> 01:00:54,174
lister tap.
And I think the first time he tapped in 

1466
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:59,700
a decade and Josh Barnett got him in a 
scarf hold.

1467
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:02,610
Um,
and that was in Metamorris.

1468
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:07,140
And Josh Barnett who is a,
he's a catch wrestling specialist.

1469
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:09,870
Yeah,
go to the very end of it here.

1470
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:13,770
Josh Barnett gets a hold of deans.
He gets it.

1471
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:16,230
C in this position right here.
He's inside control,

1472
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,310
which is just impressive enough that 
Josh was able to do this with a guy like

1473
01:01:20,311 --> 01:01:22,530
dean lister,
but then he gets him in.

1474
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,900
What's a,
I don't know,

1475
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:26,970
he probably has a different name for it,
but it's a,

1476
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:29,250
we used to call it judo side control.

1477
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:32,220
It's quite a bit further down on this.
You've got to keep going,

1478
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:33,210
keep going,
keep going,

1479
01:01:33,211 --> 01:01:38,211
keep going all the way to the end.
So he gets a hold of his,

1480
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:41,010
he's got a head and arm choke.
Here it is.

1481
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:44,760
Here it is.
So he's got his head and his arm trapped

1482
01:01:44,761 --> 01:01:45,594
together and Josh,
who's an enormously powerful person is 

1483
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,210
really neck cranking him as much as 
anything.

1484
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:52,044
And then dean was forced to tap,
but this is at the end of a long match 

1485
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:58,800
and you know,
it could have been exhaustion,

1486
01:01:58,801 --> 01:02:01,410
might've played a part in it.
It most certainly was josh.

1487
01:02:01,411 --> 01:02:04,860
His skill and his ability to apply that 
technique.

1488
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:07,950
But the point is,
is a guy like dean lister,

1489
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:09,900
you,
you're not going to tap that guy easy.

1490
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:11,870
But this is an,
again,

1491
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:15,560
again with sort of holding my hands up 
saying I'm so sort of naive,

1492
01:02:15,561 --> 01:02:18,920
a huge fan of Evan May,
but not necessarily any of the technical

1493
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:20,010
aspects.
But what I love

1494
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,660
is when you look at someone like you 
know,

1495
01:02:21,661 --> 01:02:23,150
Nick Diaz,
all Michael Bisping,

1496
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:25,800
you know,
people don't understand his conditioning

1497
01:02:25,801 --> 01:02:26,634
and he will just wear people down.
Massive mental toughness to would 

1498
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,700
bisping has is just insane mental 
toughness.

1499
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:35,160
You know,
bisping basically has one eye.

1500
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,490
If you look at his eyes,
his one of his,

1501
01:02:38,491 --> 01:02:39,324
I actually,
and I hope he can get surgery on it now 

1502
01:02:41,551 --> 01:02:42,384
because he has retired,
he has oil like embedded in his eye to 

1503
01:02:48,301 --> 01:02:52,410
protect his retina because it's been 
torn so many times been torn.

1504
01:02:52,411 --> 01:02:54,990
He had surgery on it,
he had a repair torn again.

1505
01:02:55,260 --> 01:03:00,210
His right eye is fucked up man.
And one of the reasons why he retired as

1506
01:03:00,211 --> 01:03:03,600
he started to see some irregularities in
his vision in his left eye.

1507
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,810
So as good I was fucking up too.
But I mean,

1508
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:10,020
Michael Bisping is a fucking animal.
I mean he is,

1509
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,760
he is about as tough as it gets.

1510
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:16,760
And he's not like a spectacularly 
physically talented guy like a Jon Jones

1511
01:03:17,221 --> 01:03:20,670
or Yoel Romero who was just this 
unbelievable specimen.

1512
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:21,960
Michael's a,
you know,

1513
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:26,740
a really good athlete unquestionably.
But it just taught just fucking tufts.

1514
01:03:26,741 --> 01:03:28,430
So to answer your question,
there's,

1515
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:29,273
there's this in,
you could speak to this because what 

1516
01:03:32,521 --> 01:03:33,354
you're talking about,
the ability to overcome adversity like 

1517
01:03:35,731 --> 01:03:36,564
some people when you were talking about 
that fatigue is an emotionally driven 

1518
01:03:42,331 --> 01:03:43,164
thing that there's this feeling that you
get and you can give in to that feeling 

1519
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:48,420
where you're like,
oh my God,

1520
01:03:48,421 --> 01:03:49,980
I'm fuck,
I fucking can't do this anymore.

1521
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:51,023
And some people are more susceptible to 
that than others and they give into it 

1522
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:55,500
quickly.
I mean,

1523
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,670
for a person,
here's,

1524
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:59,060
here's where you can experience this.
Like what is,

1525
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:03,240
whether or not your mindset can affect 
your,

1526
01:04:03,241 --> 01:04:04,074
your endurance,
get on a treadmill or a stationary bike 

1527
01:04:07,471 --> 01:04:09,240
or whatever you want to do for cardio.

1528
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:14,630
And then listened to a really kick ass 
song and put on headphones and that song

1529
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:18,370
comes on and you just can't fucking,
Eh,

1530
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:21,030
you could just go,
there's something about that.

1531
01:04:21,031 --> 01:04:24,210
And even if you're tired,
even if you're tired and you've put on a

1532
01:04:24,211 --> 01:04:25,380
good song,
like fuck that,

1533
01:04:25,381 --> 01:04:28,380
we're going to keep going like that.
Nothing has happened.

1534
01:04:28,381 --> 01:04:29,214
You haven't taken in any kind of a 
supplement or any kind of a stimulant 

1535
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:33,953
that you haven't gotten an injection in 
your body or you're not sucking on some 

1536
01:04:36,541 --> 01:04:39,810
kind of new gas.
Your body's exactly the same.

1537
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:43,710
But through the motivation that you're 
getting from this music,

1538
01:04:43,711 --> 01:04:46,560
the emotional stimulation,
you're just like,

1539
01:04:46,561 --> 01:04:48,090
fuck that.
We're going to keep going.

1540
01:04:48,091 --> 01:04:50,640
Yeah.
And you can keep going.

1541
01:04:50,641 --> 01:04:52,800
And not only can you keep going,
you can go faster,

1542
01:04:52,801 --> 01:04:55,890
you could push harder.
You can find these reserves.

1543
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,770
So the idea is that these reserves are 
always there.

1544
01:04:58,950 --> 01:04:59,783
You have to be able to achieve this 
state of mind that you achieve when you 

1545
01:05:01,921 --> 01:05:04,050
hear a really good song.
You know,

1546
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:06,090
and that's true that I think people 
don't understand.

1547
01:05:06,091 --> 01:05:06,924
You are the outcomist of your own body 
that you know in terms of 

1548
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,760
neurotransmitter's chemical signals in 
the brain,

1549
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:13,620
you can impact though sometimes.
Yeah,

1550
01:05:13,621 --> 01:05:14,454
you need extended liveness his music,
because you spoke about sometimes you 

1551
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:18,250
know caffeine,
but

1552
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,690
when you start to control them,
yeah,

1553
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:23,050
it can be so powerful.
Some people do it naturally,

1554
01:05:23,051 --> 01:05:25,420
I suppose,
and they've just got it in built.

1555
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:28,200
But when you start to trend,
and I think it's only now that we're,

1556
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,730
we're going down that route and looking 
at that as a,

1557
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:32,013
you know,
until previously it was one of those 

1558
01:05:32,831 --> 01:05:34,780
intangibles that you,
you,

1559
01:05:34,781 --> 01:05:38,440
you kind of under appreciate it in any 
sport and now we're going,

1560
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:39,303
oh,
okay.

1561
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:39,791
Yeah.
You know,

1562
01:05:39,791 --> 01:05:41,640
that person over there is,
you know,

1563
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:42,483
that mental fortitude or what you're 
talking about there is maybe their 

1564
01:05:44,591 --> 01:05:47,230
ability to alter their own chemistry,
biochemical reactions,

1565
01:05:47,231 --> 01:05:49,420
the body and yeah,
there's something real that happens,

1566
01:05:49,421 --> 01:05:50,500
right?
Yeah.

1567
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:51,453
Yeah.
When you hear a song and you get 

1568
01:05:52,721 --> 01:05:54,620
excited,
like whatever that hair,

1569
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:58,330
whatever that that burst is.
It seems like a real,

1570
01:05:58,331 --> 01:06:00,730
like if that was a pill and you took it,
you be like,

1571
01:06:00,731 --> 01:06:01,690
oh this works.

1572
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,033
Absolutely.
And the thing is is it's been around 

1573
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:05,523
years when you look at like um,
you know Marcus Aurelius Meditations 

1574
01:06:08,141 --> 01:06:10,180
will stomach philosophy and they're 
talking about you know,

1575
01:06:10,181 --> 01:06:12,160
dialogue being both external,
internal.

1576
01:06:12,161 --> 01:06:14,320
So the,
the conversations that go on inside your

1577
01:06:14,321 --> 01:06:15,154
own head to just as important as the 
conversations that we have with other 

1578
01:06:16,691 --> 01:06:19,600
people.
So we've understood this for years,

1579
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:24,310
but it's only just now that we're trying
to kind of apply a little bit of science

1580
01:06:24,311 --> 01:06:25,144
to it,
looking at the psychology in this mind 

1581
01:06:26,561 --> 01:06:29,530
body connection,
but the fact is yes,

1582
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:32,620
some of the greatest ancient stoics they
were trying to figure out as well.

1583
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:36,680
And when you can start to tap into that,
where that can become and,

1584
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:38,920
and it might be a particular song,
you know,

1585
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:40,370
might be a bit,
is something,

1586
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:41,500
you know,
if you get into,

1587
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:45,580
you're going to a gym or that you've got
a friend that can bring the out of you.

1588
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:48,760
Again,
you knew my training back home.

1589
01:06:48,761 --> 01:06:49,990
So you know,
Andrew Bolton,

1590
01:06:49,991 --> 01:06:50,824
who was the,
the first guy to dead lift a thousand 

1591
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:52,451
pounds.
I mean,

1592
01:06:52,451 --> 01:06:54,460
cheeses.
Yeah,

1593
01:06:54,461 --> 01:06:56,380
yeah.
I mean thousand pounds.

1594
01:06:56,410 --> 01:06:57,580
Yeah,
I mean the,

1595
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,610
the clip when you see it and he pulls a 
thousand pounds per se.

1596
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,190
It's since been being by Eddie Hall who 
did a half the time.

1597
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:04,600
So he did lift off.
Fuck.

1598
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:09,310
Editing isn't a half a ton of thousand 
pounds that a little bit less.

1599
01:07:09,311 --> 01:07:12,070
So I think thousand pounds.
What's that for?

1600
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:14,500
I thought a ton was 2000 pounds,
isn't it?

1601
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:15,391
So yet,
uh,

1602
01:07:15,391 --> 01:07:17,530
Eddie,
what's a thousand pounds in kilos?

1603
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:18,610
Oh,
you're trying to kill us.

1604
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:19,781
Sorry.
The two.

1605
01:07:19,781 --> 01:07:21,310
So yeah,
there was two metrics there.

1606
01:07:21,311 --> 01:07:23,560
So Andy Bolton,
which was a little bit 0.2

1607
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:27,340
kilos per pound.
No 2.2

1608
01:07:27,341 --> 01:07:29,410
pounds per kilo.
Yeah.

1609
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:30,191
And then,
yeah,

1610
01:07:30,191 --> 01:07:31,024
and when you see him,
I mean this is what I love when you 

1611
01:07:32,411 --> 01:07:35,140
start looking at Jesus Christ as this is
Eddie,

1612
01:07:35,141 --> 01:07:37,270
that's his,
that's his half a teller fucker.

1613
01:07:37,271 --> 01:07:40,200
His knees staying together.
Right there you look at is,

1614
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,150
if you look at how big his body is and 
how normal sizes,

1615
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:45,640
knees are,
look at the bones in his knees.

1616
01:07:45,641 --> 01:07:47,380
They look so normal.
Yeah.

1617
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,410
I mean that dies fucking people I know.
It's unbelievable.

1618
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:54,490
Unbelievable.
Oh my God.

1619
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,700
So when those guys retire,
how fucked up or their bodies,

1620
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:58,980
how would,
do you know Eddie's law?

1621
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:02,480
What's brilliant about the bees tattooed
his inside of his arm.

1622
01:08:02,490 --> 01:08:05,490
So he's going to argue with them.
Yeah,

1623
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:07,810
you're a fucking beast.
And he's nose was bleeding.

1624
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:08,861
Oh,
that's right.

1625
01:08:08,861 --> 01:08:10,690
Right.
His nose started spraying blood while he

1626
01:08:10,691 --> 01:08:14,010
was without him or another guy though I 
think you on another video,

1627
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:15,920
Arnold,
I forgotten his name.

1628
01:08:15,921 --> 01:08:16,060
He was

1629
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:20,750
Russian and just shit.
But I mean Eddie against the strength,

1630
01:08:20,751 --> 01:08:23,880
especially with the dead lift such as 
simple movement and,

1631
01:08:23,881 --> 01:08:24,714
and you know the dead lift is just 
strength is your body's ability to 

1632
01:08:27,291 --> 01:08:30,620
generate force in.
So it's neuro Musculus like what your,

1633
01:08:30,621 --> 01:08:31,454
your brain is telling your body.
So that goes back to that strength 

1634
01:08:33,321 --> 01:08:34,154
deficit that we were talking about.
Your basically santee or your body 

1635
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:37,873
recruit every single muscle fiber 
possible and working conjunctions with 

1636
01:08:41,781 --> 01:08:45,590
ligaments and tendons and then let's get
half a ton off the floor.

1637
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:48,410
Exactly right.
But when you look,

1638
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,390
and certainly with,
with Andy Barnes,

1639
01:08:50,391 --> 01:08:54,230
a thousand pound lift,
he had his friend in his face and he's,

1640
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:55,064
they're going to come,
I go and he's hitting him in the face 

1641
01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:01,060
when we were talking earlier about 
against strength deficits is,

1642
01:09:01,061 --> 01:09:01,894
is that sort of deficit between what you
can voluntarily contract an involuntary 

1643
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:09,960
contract that was him obviously 
voluntarily can drag there.

1644
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:11,690
No one was alleged human that pretty 
particular one.

1645
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:12,793
But they're there and you do anything 
that you can before you actually step 

1646
01:09:15,531 --> 01:09:17,600
out onto that platform.
And now,

1647
01:09:17,601 --> 01:09:18,434
I mean,
he would have just been completely 

1648
01:09:19,731 --> 01:09:22,550
written off after that,
that sort of Adrenal dump afterwards.

1649
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,570
He'd,
you know,

1650
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:25,100
emotionally,
but,

1651
01:09:25,101 --> 01:09:27,370
and so you have to,
you have to think about that.

1652
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:29,570
Have I forgotten who said it now?
It might have been prevail,

1653
01:09:29,571 --> 01:09:30,404
but they said,
you know,

1654
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:31,363
a safe fatigue for competition.
And I know you've spoken about that 

1655
01:09:33,411 --> 01:09:34,244
before,
so,

1656
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:35,900
um,
I can't remember.

1657
01:09:35,901 --> 01:09:39,500
He was speaking to levels are 
fascinating guy with his concepts.

1658
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:40,880
Amazing.
Yeah.

1659
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:42,440
So,
so ahead of the curve,

1660
01:09:42,441 --> 01:09:44,510
and I know you were talking to,
I can't remember who it was now,

1661
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:49,010
talking about farmers strength and that 
ability to stop short every single day.

1662
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:51,500
So never necessarily going to complete 
failure,

1663
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:54,350
but it was for us,
for us a hobby,

1664
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:55,220
I think it was.

1665
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:56,160
Yeah.
Um,

1666
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:57,063
talking about continually kind of 
avoiding that exhaustion phase and 

1667
01:10:01,131 --> 01:10:04,790
solely existing in the adaptation phase.
So,

1668
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:05,361
you know,
I mean,

1669
01:10:05,361 --> 01:10:09,410
this goes back to sell you sort of 1936,
a Hungarian physician who found,

1670
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:11,180
you know,
you give a,

1671
01:10:11,181 --> 01:10:12,260
you know,
it took some lab rats,

1672
01:10:12,261 --> 01:10:14,390
give them a lethal dose of poison.
They kill over and die.

1673
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:17,210
But he found by giving them a little bit
of poison and a little bit more,

1674
01:10:17,211 --> 01:10:19,550
a little bit more that they built up 
this intolerance to it.

1675
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:21,800
And that was the general adaptation 
syndrome.

1676
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:22,634
But it was from that that we discovered 
stress and stimuli is the key to any 

1677
01:10:26,751 --> 01:10:27,584
adaptation.
And it wasn't until the strength and 

1678
01:10:28,971 --> 01:10:30,710
conditioning community cottoned on to 
that.

1679
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:31,970
And we started to think,
okay,

1680
01:10:31,971 --> 01:10:32,804
how can we apply stress and stimulate to
the body to bring about a desired 

1681
01:10:35,091 --> 01:10:37,910
result.
And I think certainly now,

1682
01:10:37,911 --> 01:10:40,820
I think that's kind of overlooked in 
sport,

1683
01:10:40,821 --> 01:10:42,920
but certainly the Wida fitness industry 
that,

1684
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:43,680
you know,
it's,

1685
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:44,513
it's,
it's easy now in very sort of marketing 

1686
01:10:46,161 --> 01:10:48,410
driven to say get fit in,
you know,

1687
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:51,500
five easy steps or you know,
whereas the reality is,

1688
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:53,930
you know,
it's get fit in eight months after a lot

1689
01:10:53,931 --> 01:10:54,764
of stress and stimuli,
but then get fit in five easy steps is 

1690
01:10:57,861 --> 01:10:58,694
really just for,
it's just a gimmick to get people who 

1691
01:11:00,951 --> 01:11:03,620
don't actually work out to get involved.

1692
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:04,701
It is.
And,

1693
01:11:04,701 --> 01:11:04,990
but,
but,

1694
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:06,680
and that's why I love what you 
broadcast.

1695
01:11:06,681 --> 01:11:08,570
And even with the sober October and 
stuff.

1696
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:10,160
I mean,
I'm a huge fan of burt,

1697
01:11:10,161 --> 01:11:11,850
but people,
and I know he's,

1698
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:13,980
he's so funny and loves Berg,
but

1699
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:16,320
he's a beast as well.
I mean,

1700
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:18,890
when it to rock up and just do a 
marathon and again,

1701
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:19,783
that's a power to weight ratio.
What he did was amazing and I've say 

1702
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:25,870
he's really fat.
I'm not saying,

1703
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:29,910
I would never say Oh was okay,
wink wink.

1704
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:32,650
Gotcha.
I get it.

1705
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:36,040
He's a burly guy.
He's a well built a nice way.

1706
01:11:36,830 --> 01:11:39,630
He's a well built mail.
Somebody took a picture of my face,

1707
01:11:39,631 --> 01:11:44,580
I'm burns body and I was fucking threw 
up or what if I were there?

1708
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:47,310
I'm like,
no.

1709
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:48,500
Yeah,
he likes

1710
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,280
drink and he's still,
he's,

1711
01:11:50,350 --> 01:11:51,183
he is a beast because he,
despite the fact that he doesn't look 

1712
01:11:53,771 --> 01:11:57,280
like rich roll,
he's still can keep going.

1713
01:11:57,370 --> 01:11:57,911
Um,
people,

1714
01:11:57,911 --> 01:11:58,631
I don't know.
He was,

1715
01:11:58,631 --> 01:12:00,280
he was very entertaining.
We did the marathon and stuff,

1716
01:12:00,281 --> 01:12:03,700
but I was actually watching that as the 
sport's scientist in me was like,

1717
01:12:04,030 --> 01:12:06,130
that's amazing.
And no one's talking about that.

1718
01:12:06,131 --> 01:12:07,750
His,
his power to weight ratio and he's still

1719
01:12:07,751 --> 01:12:10,350
running that raffin something that and 
and yeah,

1720
01:12:10,351 --> 01:12:12,590
so first as funny and as entertaining 
it,

1721
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,320
it was to watch,
I honestly was like Bert,

1722
01:12:14,321 --> 01:12:15,130
that's amazing.

1723
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:18,760
What's more amazing is Ari honestly,
cause Ari really didn't work out.

1724
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:22,990
Ari came in second place and he came in 
second place by only a thousand points,

1725
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:26,680
which is a one day I got a thousand 
points in a day.

1726
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:30,220
So he was really only a thousand points 
behind me but it's a crazy day.

1727
01:12:30,221 --> 01:12:34,110
That's like a seven hours of work in a 
day or so.

1728
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:38,230
At least six and a half hours of work in
a day and a lot of it at 80% of your max

1729
01:12:38,231 --> 01:12:39,730
heart rate.
But he still,

1730
01:12:39,970 --> 01:12:40,803
he wasn't doing anything before this 
thing started and he was the first one 

1731
01:12:45,191 --> 01:12:46,024
to figure out that you get the same 
amount of points for 80% of your Max 

1732
01:12:48,671 --> 01:12:49,504
heart rate as you do for 90 I thought 
you'd get more for 90 so I was just 

1733
01:12:51,911 --> 01:12:52,744
trying to kill myself every day and then
I was only being able to come out with 

1734
01:12:55,931 --> 01:12:59,980
like 230 points and and similar along 
those lines,

1735
01:12:59,981 --> 01:13:01,750
because I was,
I would max out,

1736
01:13:01,751 --> 01:13:05,200
it was doing like 90% of my max heart 
rate for like 30 35 minutes.

1737
01:13:05,201 --> 01:13:06,034
I was like exhausted.
And then Ari figured out that 80 points 

1738
01:13:10,031 --> 01:13:11,460
pays just as much.
Right.

1739
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:15,300
And so he started watching movies while 
he was on an elliptical machine and that

1740
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:19,510
that just turned the whole thing into 
this sort of steady,

1741
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:20,733
not fast marathon,
which was really fascinating because I 

1742
01:13:24,971 --> 01:13:25,804
never exercised like that before and it 
changed my endurance radically over a 

1743
01:13:29,921 --> 01:13:30,754
month.
What's interesting is that changed my 

1744
01:13:32,561 --> 01:13:35,680
endurance in things that are explosive,
like kickboxing.

1745
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:40,690
Okay.
What's it say having that aerobic base a

1746
01:13:40,691 --> 01:13:42,590
lot?
How did he

1747
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:45,030
set in?
So I would do,

1748
01:13:45,031 --> 01:13:45,864
I would do,
after a while we were doing so much 

1749
01:13:48,331 --> 01:13:51,060
exercise and I had to do different 
things or I would get bored.

1750
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:52,223
So I would do a circuit of the 
elliptical machine and then I would 

1751
01:13:55,081 --> 01:13:57,750
follow the elliptical machine with,
um,

1752
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:58,860
a war.
Or I would do,

1753
01:13:58,861 --> 01:14:02,310
I would run on Sundays,
I'd either run elliptical machine,

1754
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:03,173
kickbox,
and on other days I would do the echo 

1755
01:14:05,911 --> 01:14:06,744
bike,
which is an airdyne machine that rogue 

1756
01:14:08,131 --> 01:14:08,964
makes.
And then I would do the rowing machine 

1757
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,550
and then I would do the versaclimber

1758
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:16,420
and then I added in that air runner 
treadmill,

1759
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:17,920
which is,
what is it called?

1760
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:19,460
Air Assault,
I think.

1761
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:20,500
Air Assault.
Treadmill.

1762
01:14:20,530 --> 01:14:21,363
Yeah.
Which is a treadmill that you power 

1763
01:14:22,331 --> 01:14:23,560
yourself,
you,

1764
01:14:23,561 --> 01:14:24,394
you,
your feet pushing on it and pulling it 

1765
01:14:27,071 --> 01:14:27,904
is what makes it go fast.
It's not like a treadmill that you keep 

1766
01:14:30,101 --> 01:14:32,290
up with.
It's actually more difficult than actual

1767
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:32,911
running.
Great.

1768
01:14:32,911 --> 01:14:33,320
Right,
right.

1769
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:36,220
13% more difficult and actual running on
the street.

1770
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:37,653
So I d I was going crazy.
I couldn't do the same things over and 

1771
01:14:41,321 --> 01:14:42,154
over again.
So I kept mixing them up and when I 

1772
01:14:43,481 --> 01:14:45,790
would mix them up by the end of the 
month,

1773
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:49,630
my kickboxing was,
I had way more endurance.

1774
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:50,793
Like I could do 10 hard rounds going 
three minutes each round and then I 

1775
01:14:55,211 --> 01:14:56,044
would recover in between rounds.
The one minute in between rounds I'd 

1776
01:14:58,301 --> 01:14:59,134
recover quick cause I'm wearing a heart 
rate monitor and watching my heart rate 

1777
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:02,913
dip.

1778
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:03,783
It was dipping really quickly.
And then I had all this energy and 

1779
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:09,370
madness like everything was changing.
Like my,

1780
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:12,970
my capacity for work changed,
everything adapted.

1781
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:15,610
I got a little dehydrated one time and I
had pissed.

1782
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:17,500
It looked like ice tea,
which is not good.

1783
01:15:17,501 --> 01:15:22,501
So I started panicking and wondering 
about things like rob dough,

1784
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:23,433
my locis kidney failure,
but I didn't have anything wrong with 

1785
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:27,910
that.
It was just a little bit of penetration.

1786
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:28,773
But what's interesting to go about,
what we were talking about that you've 

1787
01:15:29,981 --> 01:15:32,590
just perfectly described,
that idea of,

1788
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,780
of given a clear cellular signal to the 
body.

1789
01:15:34,781 --> 01:15:38,260
So polarized training.
If you know the 80 20 that you do,

1790
01:15:38,261 --> 01:15:39,510
80% of your,
you know,

1791
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:40,363
your work,
your training in that aerobic realm 

1792
01:15:41,981 --> 01:15:43,530
where you can keep doing that,
it's,

1793
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:44,463
you're not going to overtrain there,
you're going to avoid that exhaustion 

1794
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:49,180
things he says,
Salvia indestructable rats,

1795
01:15:49,181 --> 01:15:50,014
you know,
you're not going to keel over and die 

1796
01:15:50,621 --> 01:15:53,410
from a lethal dose of stress and 
stimuli.

1797
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:54,713
But then over here,
you know you would that 20% it was 

1798
01:15:57,371 --> 01:15:58,720
powerful.
It was kickboxing.

1799
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:01,120
So there you're working technique but 
you're fresh.

1800
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:02,093
So you're drilling motor patterns that 
completely fresh and not fatigued 

1801
01:16:04,511 --> 01:16:05,344
because you're doing this 80% on an 
elliptical trainer while watching a 

1802
01:16:08,051 --> 01:16:09,400
movie.
So you teach,

1803
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:11,470
you're keeping the two completely 
separate.

1804
01:16:11,471 --> 01:16:14,530
Yes.
But considering the body in its entirety

1805
01:16:14,531 --> 01:16:15,364
that when it comes together,
you've created a more powerful version 

1806
01:16:18,401 --> 01:16:19,234
of yourself.
And I think it was interesting what you 

1807
01:16:20,981 --> 01:16:24,190
just said there about recovery between 
bouts as well.

1808
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:27,220
So when you start looking at a strong 
man training,

1809
01:16:27,221 --> 01:16:28,060
you know,
the,

1810
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:29,223
some of the strongest guys and that one 
of the strongest guys in the world all 

1811
01:16:32,141 --> 01:16:35,530
understood the benefits of,
of cardio spiritually training.

1812
01:16:35,531 --> 01:16:37,180
You look at you again,
geoff capes.

1813
01:16:37,390 --> 01:16:38,223
Um,
two time world's strongest man was 

1814
01:16:39,191 --> 01:16:43,620
running fell racism marathons at 25.
So fillery's fellow races.

1815
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:44,561
It's,
yeah,

1816
01:16:44,561 --> 01:16:47,440
it's quite specific to England.
So it's kind of trail running,

1817
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:48,783
but we call them fellow running because 
you're going to going through bogs and 

1818
01:16:51,221 --> 01:16:54,090
marshes and felled trees.
Not,

1819
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:57,400
not necessarily fell cheese,
but just kind of the terrain is a little

1820
01:16:57,401 --> 01:16:59,380
bit different from Troy said he was 
doing that.

1821
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:02,650
When you look at our Bill Kasman again,
well the strongest man a power lifter,

1822
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:03,484
but understood the benefits of,
of cardiorespiratory trying to improve 

1823
01:17:06,191 --> 01:17:08,710
his recovery between sets.
Brian Shaw as well.

1824
01:17:08,711 --> 01:17:09,411
One of the,
uh,

1825
01:17:09,411 --> 01:17:10,244
you know,
the sort of,

1826
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:11,360
uh,
you know,

1827
01:17:11,361 --> 01:17:14,360
the newest as sort of strong man and a 
former basketball player,

1828
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:15,403
you know,
so he had that cardio respiratory 

1829
01:17:17,481 --> 01:17:18,314
endurance that base the aerobic base,
and then he built this incredible 

1830
01:17:22,311 --> 01:17:27,311
strength on top of that aerobic 
foundation goes back again to whether,

1831
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:29,360
you know,
they knew it or not,

1832
01:17:29,361 --> 01:17:30,194
they were almost creating an athlete.
Like they were creating athletes back 

1833
01:17:32,721 --> 01:17:33,510
in,
uh,

1834
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:36,350
the sort of Soviet Union era when they 
were taking athletes going,

1835
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:37,393
right,
you're giving me a kid and I don't know 

1836
01:17:38,751 --> 01:17:40,520
if he's strong,
quick,

1837
01:17:40,521 --> 01:17:42,190
good at running,
running fast or running fight,

1838
01:17:42,191 --> 01:17:43,024
I don't know.
So we're going to build this aerobic 

1839
01:17:44,811 --> 01:17:45,644
neuromuscular base and when they show 
any sort of genetic potential to be 

1840
01:17:49,551 --> 01:17:50,480
strong,
quick,

1841
01:17:50,481 --> 01:17:52,130
whatever,
we're going to hone in on that.

1842
01:17:52,131 --> 01:17:54,350
And that's only when we're going to get 
specific.

1843
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:57,050
And you're almost doing that now,
you know,

1844
01:17:57,051 --> 01:17:58,610
and certainly Brian Schorr did it again.

1845
01:17:58,610 --> 01:17:59,443
You look,
you look through all of the best 

1846
01:18:01,101 --> 01:18:03,830
athletes in the world.
They've all followed this blueprint,

1847
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,100
but it's only now that we're kind of 
dissecting that and saying,

1848
01:18:07,101 --> 01:18:09,140
okay,
I'm making it a bit more purposeful.

1849
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:10,520
Who's this gentlemen?
Here we go,

1850
01:18:10,521 --> 01:18:12,380
there's Brian Shore.
He said,

1851
01:18:12,381 --> 01:18:14,750
yeah,
bass run with his legs were all swollen,

1852
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:18,470
but I mean even now I tell you what 
Jamie,

1853
01:18:18,471 --> 01:18:19,490
if it's possible,
actually,

1854
01:18:19,491 --> 01:18:22,760
I mean Brian Shore,
he accidentally,

1855
01:18:22,761 --> 01:18:25,760
you must have seen this clip set,
the indoor rowing record.

1856
01:18:25,761 --> 01:18:28,490
I think it was for a hook in this size 
of this mother fucker.

1857
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:31,010
Oh my God.
And he rocks.

1858
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:32,390
Converse.
All stars.

1859
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:33,450
Look at that.
Cool.

1860
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:37,540
He set the visit visit clip on Youtube.
That memo man's wearing chucks.

1861
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:39,253
He sets,
there's a clip on youtube where he sets 

1862
01:18:40,731 --> 01:18:42,140
the,
the rowing record,

1863
01:18:42,141 --> 01:18:45,470
the indoor rowing record and it was just
because he,

1864
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:46,280
yeah,
there we go.

1865
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:49,880
He didn't know he was setting in.
So these basically down there,

1866
01:18:49,881 --> 01:18:54,881
he's rowing and it sounds like someone 
started an engine like this.

1867
01:18:55,791 --> 01:18:57,920
He go and we're here at this,
said this,

1868
01:18:57,921 --> 01:18:59,750
they've just looked at how he rose to 
the mountain.

1869
01:18:59,830 --> 01:19:00,663
These look the whole thing.
They have to hold it down in the end 

1870
01:19:03,191 --> 01:19:06,160
cause he's coming out of the floor.
Jesus Christ.

1871
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:08,640
These guys are standing on it.
It sounds like,

1872
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:11,200
like just an that's a jet engine,
right?

1873
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,150
We're all that power from it.

1874
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:15,300
Exactly.
Well no and he's bad.

1875
01:19:15,301 --> 01:19:16,134
I mean that technique as well.
I mean I hope Brian doesn't mind me 

1876
01:19:18,571 --> 01:19:20,830
saying it's not necessarily,
you know,

1877
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:21,833
Olympic rowing technique,
but he doesn't need it cause he's just 

1878
01:19:24,361 --> 01:19:25,194
got silly power technique.
So the hundred well there's a catch 

1879
01:19:29,461 --> 01:19:30,294
phase and it's more,
you're almost treating it more like a 

1880
01:19:32,881 --> 01:19:35,730
dead lift where you're using your larger
leg muscles where,

1881
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:36,370
which is

1882
01:19:36,370 --> 01:19:37,400
look at him go,
there you go.

1883
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:42,840
Oh my God.
Fuck it.

1884
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:43,683
Savage.

1885
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:45,720
Oh crazy.
To Watch.

1886
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:48,360
Unbelievable amount of force he can 
generate.

1887
01:19:48,361 --> 01:19:50,850
He looks like a very tall man too.
He's huge.

1888
01:19:51,210 --> 01:19:53,190
How big is this guy?
Six eight,

1889
01:19:53,191 --> 01:19:54,050
six,
nine.

1890
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:55,350
So that helps too.
Right?

1891
01:19:55,351 --> 01:19:57,040
Cause the long stroke.
Absolute.

1892
01:19:57,041 --> 01:19:58,770
It's just pure power.
But anyway,

1893
01:19:58,771 --> 01:20:00,480
so they found that they,
during this session,

1894
01:20:00,481 --> 01:20:01,314
I believe what happened is they said,
well you know a rower shouldn't make 

1895
01:20:04,621 --> 01:20:06,900
that sort of noisy.
He goes six ways that he's basically two

1896
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:12,350
put together for what?
401 600 8,425

1897
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:17,430
that's two big guys strapped together in
one body.

1898
01:20:17,431 --> 01:20:21,960
He's almost 200 pounds above the UFC 
heavyweight limit.

1899
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:23,423
Deon saying that is UFC heavyweight,
limit it to 65 he's almost 200 pounds 

1900
01:20:29,551 --> 01:20:34,551
too heavy to fight heavyweight division 
of the UFC motherfucker basketball,

1901
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:35,950
basketball background.
And,

1902
01:20:35,951 --> 01:20:36,870
and he's still,
look,

1903
01:20:36,871 --> 01:20:39,180
he didn't know that he was going to set 
the world record for rowing.

1904
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:40,260
So the rowing record,
they go,

1905
01:20:40,261 --> 01:20:41,094
here's one was 12.8
I believe it was 1308 broke the wrong 

1906
01:20:44,731 --> 01:20:45,564
record.
But because he had that neuro 

1907
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:50,160
neuromuscular background that they said,
Hey Brian,

1908
01:20:50,161 --> 01:20:52,590
you're big and powerful,
just this is a rowing machine.

1909
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:53,491
He went,
oh,

1910
01:20:53,491 --> 01:20:54,151
okay.
And it's like,

1911
01:20:54,151 --> 01:20:54,751
oh,
there you go.

1912
01:20:54,751 --> 01:20:56,220
Congratulations.
There's a world record.

1913
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:00,020
So it's that base that I think so often 
I've heard you speak about,

1914
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:01,620
and certainly Eddie as well talking 
about,

1915
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:03,450
um,
breakdancers making great.

1916
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:05,910
Yes.
And again,

1917
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:08,640
whether you knew or not,
they had that neuromuscular foundation.

1918
01:21:08,641 --> 01:21:11,250
They understood proprioception,
where the ligaments,

1919
01:21:11,251 --> 01:21:12,660
tendons,
everything should work.

1920
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:14,153
Whereas if you had someone with a 
similar work capacity or someone at the 

1921
01:21:16,291 --> 01:21:18,360
same age,
everything was the same,

1922
01:21:18,361 --> 01:21:20,670
but they didn't have that neuromuscular 
efficiency,

1923
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:21,600
you'd say,
okay,

1924
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:22,291
and again,
this is me.

1925
01:21:22,291 --> 01:21:23,350
So naively,
again,

1926
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:25,500
I certainly don't claim to know anything
about Bjj,

1927
01:21:25,501 --> 01:21:26,071
but you go,
okay,

1928
01:21:26,071 --> 01:21:26,820
this is an arm bar.

1929
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:28,080
This is,
I think they kind of go,

1930
01:21:28,081 --> 01:21:29,970
okay,
let me try and figure this out.

1931
01:21:29,971 --> 01:21:31,800
And you can see them.
It's like a Rubik's cube.

1932
01:21:31,830 --> 01:21:35,220
They're trying to piece it together.
But you get someone again,

1933
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:37,020
like Brian and you go,
okay,

1934
01:21:37,021 --> 01:21:40,200
this is Bj Jay,
or something quite complex that requires

1935
01:21:40,201 --> 01:21:42,990
you and he,
I'm not saying he wouldn't even fight.

1936
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:44,310
It's too,
it's too heavy.

1937
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:47,100
Then I have to open up the super heavy 
division,

1938
01:21:47,450 --> 01:21:49,830
but he was doing a similar movement to 
dead lifts,

1939
01:21:49,831 --> 01:21:51,720
which is very common.
It is.

1940
01:21:51,721 --> 01:21:53,790
And when he's used to that movement,
it is.

1941
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:54,660
Yeah,
it is.

1942
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:57,420
But I suppose where you saw him,
you know that wasn't actually,

1943
01:21:57,570 --> 01:22:00,510
there was no extension of the back.
He was bent over.

1944
01:22:00,511 --> 01:22:02,130
Just repeat.
There's another one again,

1945
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,170
even to use Brian is an example where he
does,

1946
01:22:04,171 --> 01:22:05,250
uh,
I believe,

1947
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:06,840
I can't remember the name of the ward 
now,

1948
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:08,590
but he went up,
um,

1949
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:09,870
and four as well.

1950
01:22:09,870 --> 01:22:11,770
Another strong man did a,
uh,

1951
01:22:11,790 --> 01:22:14,490
I think it was a,
I might clean and jerk.

1952
01:22:14,491 --> 01:22:15,324
There was a ward that was predominantly 
clean and jerk and there's this amazing 

1953
01:22:17,740 --> 01:22:21,210
crossfitter technique was beautiful,
disappearing under the bar,

1954
01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:22,053
back over his head.
It was amazing to watch and I think it 

1955
01:22:23,911 --> 01:22:27,330
was thor or Brian Shaw went in and just 
instead of a clean and jerk and Joe,

1956
01:22:27,331 --> 01:22:30,210
honestly,
he just basically upright rows,

1957
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:32,550
the whole thing and complete.
And they were like,

1958
01:22:32,551 --> 01:22:37,530
well that's not clean and jerk,
but you just set a record again.

1959
01:22:37,710 --> 01:22:40,920
So there's that element.
And to use an example as well with,

1960
01:22:40,921 --> 01:22:41,611
with the,
Oh,

1961
01:22:41,611 --> 01:22:42,720
here we go.
Here we go.

1962
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:44,820
Oh my God,
it's insane.

1963
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,020
Wait,
hopefully it is a crop.

1964
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:47,520
That is insane.
Okay.

1965
01:22:47,521 --> 01:22:48,960
There's another strongly,
but there is,

1966
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:53,400
there's another one of those where you 
see the crossfit or with this amazing,

1967
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:54,234
beautiful technique.
He's so far from his justice crazy that 

1968
01:22:58,561 --> 01:22:59,394
he's doing it like that.
And what is that 225 pounds as though I 

1969
01:23:03,121 --> 01:23:05,880
don't actually know what everything from
the fucking

1970
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:09,580
shit that is so crazy that he could do 
that.

1971
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,900
Look at how he's doing so many reps.
Right,

1972
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:14,350
right.
That is insane.

1973
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:16,180
But he doesn't have a pause.
No,

1974
01:23:16,181 --> 01:23:17,980
but back he said that's meant to be a 
clean joke.

1975
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:18,843
I know.
So that's what I mean about that neuro 

1976
01:23:20,091 --> 01:23:22,210
muscular efficiency that he's gone,
okay,

1977
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:24,790
here's a new sport.
Come and get involved.

1978
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:25,471
And he's going,
okay,

1979
01:23:25,471 --> 01:23:26,304
I see the rules of your sport,
but I'm going to do it my way and it 

1980
01:23:29,150 --> 01:23:30,550
doesn't count.
Well,

1981
01:23:30,551 --> 01:23:31,480
yeah,
I suppose,

1982
01:23:31,481 --> 01:23:33,760
I mean if that word is just put the 
weight above your head,

1983
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:34,920
um,
like duck,

1984
01:23:34,921 --> 01:23:36,960
I did it normal that time right there.
That's it.

1985
01:23:36,961 --> 01:23:37,670
Yeah.

1986
01:23:37,670 --> 01:23:38,850
Yeah.
But there's,

1987
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:40,053
there's,
um,

1988
01:23:40,610 --> 01:23:41,470
if you put in,
you know,

1989
01:23:41,490 --> 01:23:43,190
thor,
uh,

1990
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:44,053
versus crossfit there,
then it will probably come up and you 

1991
01:23:45,321 --> 01:23:49,250
get to see an amazing crisp technique.
And then equally,

1992
01:23:49,370 --> 01:23:52,120
um,
thor is basically doing what,

1993
01:23:52,121 --> 01:23:54,820
what Brian was doing just there.
I'll you go.

1994
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:57,440
So this is their keep putting on weight 
until one of them.

1995
01:23:57,441 --> 01:23:59,270
I believe that competition as you keep 
it or not.

1996
01:23:59,271 --> 01:24:00,680
Yeah,
they're your crossfit versus a mountain.

1997
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:02,930
It's an amazing technique.
Disappears under the bar,

1998
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:04,101
you know,
incredible.

1999
01:24:04,101 --> 01:24:05,110
And then I think,
you know,

2000
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:05,993
thor would eventually come in and give 
it a go and basically just I'm upright 

2001
01:24:08,841 --> 01:24:09,950
rows,
here we go.

2002
01:24:10,790 --> 01:24:11,840
So you saw that,
you know,

2003
01:24:11,841 --> 01:24:14,240
disappears under the bus,
speed of movement.

2004
01:24:14,330 --> 01:24:16,180
Amazing.
And then all come,

2005
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,470
come and have a go at this and a,
this is what he,

2006
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:20,330
he produces.

2007
01:24:23,690 --> 01:24:26,990
So there's that neuromuscular 
efficiency.

2008
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,360
There was just mad strength.
It is.

2009
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:29,880
It is.

2010
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:31,800
I mean,
you could do that too if you just had an

2011
01:24:31,801 --> 01:24:34,080
empty bar.
You know what I mean?

2012
01:24:34,081 --> 01:24:37,080
Like that kind of person.
The kind of person that can do that.

2013
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:40,950
When you think about him dead lifting a 
thousand pounds or any of these guys who

2014
01:24:40,951 --> 01:24:41,784
can deadlift in insane numbers,
just the whole machine can generate so 

2015
01:24:46,021 --> 01:24:46,854
much force.

2016
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:48,280
Yeah.
Yeah.

2017
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:49,750
And that,
and that's it though.

2018
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:50,590
It's,
it is.

2019
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:53,800
They're able to do that again because of
that foundation.

2020
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:56,980
They body can generate that force and 
then you say,

2021
01:24:56,981 --> 01:24:57,814
here's a new movement and you can see 
them look like for that example of a 

2022
01:25:01,121 --> 01:25:02,350
case.
So that's a clean and jerk.

2023
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:03,830
Okay.
I can't figure that out.

2024
01:25:03,850 --> 01:25:05,080
I think I've found a way,

2025
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:06,913
lends credence to the concept that dead 
lifts is like the mother of all 

2026
01:25:10,071 --> 01:25:10,904
exercises because it really does work.
All your muscle groups and if you can 

2027
01:25:14,031 --> 01:25:18,020
get really strong at dead lifts,
I mean it really does enhance almost any

2028
01:25:18,021 --> 01:25:20,240
single athletic endeavor you participate
in.

2029
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:21,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

2030
01:25:21,171 --> 01:25:22,004
And I think again,
that's sort of been lost a little bit 

2031
01:25:24,291 --> 01:25:26,630
along the way that they're getting the 
joints,

2032
01:25:26,631 --> 01:25:27,291
ligaments,
muscles,

2033
01:25:27,291 --> 01:25:30,800
everything to work cohesively.
And when you do that for your training,

2034
01:25:30,801 --> 01:25:33,830
you can pretty much apply to anything.
So I think that's why,

2035
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:37,070
I mean I again,
I used to swim ages ages ago,

2036
01:25:37,071 --> 01:25:40,170
way back in the day,
but I was never going to make sort of an

2037
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:42,200
elite standard.
I'm five,

2038
01:25:42,201 --> 01:25:44,360
nine on a good day,
maybe I'm built like a hobbit.

2039
01:25:44,361 --> 01:25:44,860
So

2040
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:49,010
everyone else is just great grace for,
yeah,

2041
01:25:49,550 --> 01:25:49,760
so

2042
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:50,593
I ended up,
again almost accidentally going into 

2043
01:25:52,671 --> 01:25:55,460
strength training.
I played water polo in the end,

2044
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,860
um,
to a fairly good level.

2045
01:25:57,861 --> 01:25:59,960
So I was doing that.
But again I just got beaten up.

2046
01:25:59,961 --> 01:26:00,794
I was 16 playing in the senior's league 
and you just big guys with beards just 

2047
01:26:04,761 --> 01:26:05,594
beating me up.

2048
01:26:06,570 --> 01:26:07,403
It's interesting what you were talking 
about earlier in terms of mental 

2049
01:26:10,741 --> 01:26:14,400
fortitude and your ability to adapt and 
your ability to overcome.

2050
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:18,360
I wonder if we're ever going to figure 
out a way to measure that.

2051
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:19,513
Like to measure in d mental endurance or
measure mental capacity or mental 

2052
01:26:24,241 --> 01:26:25,430
stimulation.
You know,

2053
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:29,940
you can measure your vo two Max and you 
know what the body's capable of.

2054
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:35,130
But I wonder if there's a way,
like when someone does hear a great song

2055
01:26:35,131 --> 01:26:35,964
and it kicks in,
whether it's through Fsri or any other 

2056
01:26:38,341 --> 01:26:41,360
type of detection device where they can 
figure out a way,

2057
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:46,400
oh this part of your brain is firing,
let's concentrate on building up the,

2058
01:26:46,711 --> 01:26:49,680
the activation of that part of that 
brain of the brain.

2059
01:26:49,681 --> 01:26:51,930
Like,
like muscle when like,

2060
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:53,753
think of that endurance or think of that
motivation as like maybe even a mantra 

2061
01:26:59,071 --> 01:26:59,904
that you can call upon.
Cause he call upon it all the time and 

2062
01:27:02,081 --> 01:27:03,750
he can recreate that state.

2063
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:04,653
Yeah,
I mean,

2064
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:06,160
I think on,
on that point,

2065
01:27:06,190 --> 01:27:08,110
certainly over in Britain at the moment.
So,

2066
01:27:08,111 --> 01:27:09,140
um,
uh,

2067
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:10,050
basically,
uh,

2068
01:27:10,050 --> 01:27:13,750
a women for the first time can actually 
apply and be in the special forces.

2069
01:27:14,050 --> 01:27:14,883
So at the moment is really,
really interesting because I'm speaking 

2070
01:27:17,591 --> 01:27:19,870
to you certainly the Royal Marines,
they were saying,

2071
01:27:20,410 --> 01:27:24,640
we've got hundreds of years that if you 
hand is 500 young fit men,

2072
01:27:25,090 --> 01:27:27,310
we can say they need to be this weight,
this tall.

2073
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:28,593
And if you give as them,
we've got years and years of experience 

2074
01:27:30,761 --> 01:27:34,750
of putting them through this training 
system of mental and physical fortitude,

2075
01:27:34,751 --> 01:27:36,460
everything down in lympstone,
it's the,

2076
01:27:36,461 --> 01:27:37,294
the,
the training center of the Royal 

2077
01:27:38,350 --> 01:27:40,060
Marines.
And we go on this insurance costs,

2078
01:27:40,061 --> 01:27:41,980
we go on a 30 mile young with a 
backpack,

2079
01:27:42,010 --> 01:27:44,320
everything.
And by the end of 32 weeks,

2080
01:27:44,321 --> 01:27:45,154
that's what it takes to be a royal 
marine to get your green baret after 32 

2081
01:27:48,011 --> 01:27:50,740
weeks,
we can take you from being completely,

2082
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:53,770
not sedan tree,
but unfit to being a royal marine.

2083
01:27:53,770 --> 01:27:55,270
And that's one thing they pride 
themselves on.

2084
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:58,540
But now what they're saying is 
obviously,

2085
01:27:58,541 --> 01:28:00,340
you know,
females can apply to the special forces.

2086
01:28:00,341 --> 01:28:03,850
And what they find so interesting is,
and I certainly do as well,

2087
01:28:03,851 --> 01:28:04,684
is what,
what does that look like for a female 

2088
01:28:06,821 --> 01:28:07,690
role marine?
You know,

2089
01:28:07,691 --> 01:28:09,820
what does that look like for the themes?
And again,

2090
01:28:09,821 --> 01:28:10,840
to go back,
I mean,

2091
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:13,320
I wrote an article ages ago,
um,

2092
01:28:13,930 --> 01:28:17,110
run like a girl and I was saying,
I want to run like a girl.

2093
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:17,711
You know,
some of them,

2094
01:28:17,711 --> 01:28:20,020
some of my best training partners are 
female and they,

2095
01:28:20,290 --> 01:28:23,680
their perception to fatigue is 
unbelievable.

2096
01:28:23,681 --> 01:28:25,480
That's purely anecdotal.
But also as well,

2097
01:28:25,481 --> 01:28:28,690
when you look at the top tier of ultra 
marathon runners and swimming as well,

2098
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:32,470
Diana Niaid first to go from Florida to 
Cuba to Florida,

2099
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:34,510
you know,
incredible.

2100
01:28:34,511 --> 01:28:37,120
Like she was getting stung by Portuguese
manowar's and stuff.

2101
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:39,570
Just unbelievable.
So it's purely debts,

2102
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:40,900
but now the saying,
you know,

2103
01:28:41,170 --> 01:28:43,930
w why is it that that certainly my 
athletes have a,

2104
01:28:43,931 --> 01:28:47,830
a greater tolerance to pain.
And I think to your point,

2105
01:28:47,831 --> 01:28:48,664
if we can start to quantify that,
because there are biological 

2106
01:28:51,521 --> 01:28:52,990
differences.
If you take men,

2107
01:28:53,290 --> 01:28:56,080
high testosterone can have an impact on 
high hemoglobin,

2108
01:28:56,081 --> 01:28:57,760
generate muscle force,
all of these things.

2109
01:28:58,490 --> 01:28:59,323
But,
but I think if we could quantify why it 

2110
01:29:01,861 --> 01:29:01,980
is

2111
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:02,813
that certain female athletes are 
dominating the top 10% of ultra 

2112
01:29:06,661 --> 01:29:10,770
marathons and an open water swimming,
what is it that they're doing that would

2113
01:29:10,771 --> 01:29:14,370
be amazing?
I think the ability to endure pain,

2114
01:29:15,090 --> 01:29:17,190
and this is not my thought,
honestly,

2115
01:29:17,191 --> 01:29:20,310
I should just say this has been 
theorized before,

2116
01:29:20,490 --> 01:29:24,300
has to do with their ability to endure 
the pain of childbirth,

2117
01:29:24,690 --> 01:29:25,523
child labor and childbirth.
I mean just the fact that they're 

2118
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:30,480
forcing a baby out of their vagina.
Yeah.

2119
01:29:30,570 --> 01:29:32,900
I mean that is insane.
I mean,

2120
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:34,710
we aren't too.
Have you ever seen the machine?

2121
01:29:34,711 --> 01:29:36,780
They do.
They've taken these electrodes,

2122
01:29:36,781 --> 01:29:37,614
they put it on men and recreate the pain
of childbirth Ed and watch these men 

2123
01:29:43,231 --> 01:29:45,810
funding to fall apart.
Like fucking turn it off.

2124
01:29:46,970 --> 01:29:47,910
Yeah,
it's,

2125
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:50,790
it's,
I mean obviously I haven't given birth,

2126
01:29:50,791 --> 01:29:51,624
but it's supposed to be unbelievably 
painful and women are biologically 

2127
01:29:55,021 --> 01:29:56,070
suited to this.

2128
01:29:56,070 --> 01:29:56,903
This is like,
so I think their ability to endure that 

2129
01:29:59,221 --> 01:30:02,580
pain is just,
it's probably just,

2130
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:07,610
there's an evolutionary advantage to 
having this more higher capacity.

2131
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:08,873
But I also think one of the things that 
I learned from teaching martial arts is 

2132
01:30:11,881 --> 01:30:15,780
that women,
they learned technique better many times

2133
01:30:15,781 --> 01:30:20,370
then men do because one,
they listen and two,

2134
01:30:20,371 --> 01:30:21,204
they don't try to muscle things.
So women have less of a problem with 

2135
01:30:25,141 --> 01:30:29,280
learning something from a person.
And this is also true about archery.

2136
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:31,470
My friend John Dudley,
who is an archery coach,

2137
01:30:31,471 --> 01:30:35,670
says his favorite students are always 
women because they listen better.

2138
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,590
Um,
they don't have as much of an ego.

2139
01:30:37,591 --> 01:30:39,360
They don't have to pretend they already 
know something.

2140
01:30:39,361 --> 01:30:41,640
They don't want to just try it without 
it.

2141
01:30:41,641 --> 01:30:44,280
They follow it to a t better.
Like generally,

2142
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:45,780
obviously we're speaking in 
generalities,

2143
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:50,600
but um,
they also don't have the uh,

2144
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:52,650
extra muscle that a man has.

2145
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,420
So men,
when they're strong,

2146
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:55,373
we'll try to just force things,
muscle things where women will try to 

2147
01:30:58,471 --> 01:30:59,304
follow what's being described to them,
what's the proper technique and they do 

2148
01:31:02,881 --> 01:31:03,714
it properly all the time.
And then they develop this pattern of 

2149
01:31:07,381 --> 01:31:08,214
proper technique.
I noticed this with taekwondo and I 

2150
01:31:10,201 --> 01:31:12,020
think my friend John said he,
oh,

2151
01:31:12,030 --> 01:31:14,430
he noticed this with archery.
I think this,

2152
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:15,293
this,
this benefits them in sports because 

2153
01:31:17,701 --> 01:31:21,510
like if you learn Jujitsu,
you really the best people to learn from

2154
01:31:21,511 --> 01:31:25,920
our smaller men or women because they,
the smaller people,

2155
01:31:25,950 --> 01:31:29,250
they don't have the physical strength to
pull it off on a big guy.

2156
01:31:29,670 --> 01:31:32,640
So what they have to rely on is correct 
technique.

2157
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:35,820
But if you learn Jujitsu from a big guy,
man,

2158
01:31:35,821 --> 01:31:40,440
big Guy Jujitsu's weird because they 
could just grab your wrist and you can't

2159
01:31:40,441 --> 01:31:41,274
get go.
You can't let go and they can get away 

2160
01:31:42,331 --> 01:31:43,320
with things like,
okay,

2161
01:31:43,321 --> 01:31:45,150
you go risk control and throw the legs 
up.

2162
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:46,163
Risk Control.
Okay risk control on who try risk 

2163
01:31:49,561 --> 01:31:52,350
control on that big mother fucker that 
was rowing the world record.

2164
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:53,423
You ain't getting shit man.
You're going to go flying through the 

2165
01:31:55,411 --> 01:31:56,990
air that was controlling it or work.
Right.

2166
01:31:57,060 --> 01:31:59,070
You're going to have to go against his 
strength.

2167
01:31:59,310 --> 01:32:01,330
You're going to have to figure out a way
to move around it.

2168
01:32:01,331 --> 01:32:02,860
You don't have to go,
you're not going to go through it.

2169
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:04,210
Right.
That big guy,

2170
01:32:04,211 --> 01:32:05,044
if he was teaching Jujitsu who I just 
grabbed her neck and on your squeeze 

2171
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:09,213
he's,
he's got the kind of horsepower that a 

2172
01:32:11,951 --> 01:32:14,560
man like you know a normal man can't 
imagine.

2173
01:32:14,610 --> 01:32:15,443
Yeah.
Do you think that's changing again to 

2174
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:19,510
bring it back to the UFC I suppose.
Cause now,

2175
01:32:19,511 --> 01:32:21,450
I mean with what call me,
he's doing and,

2176
01:32:21,451 --> 01:32:23,730
and you know John Jones coming back then
the lightweights,

2177
01:32:23,731 --> 01:32:24,940
we're all moving up to heavyweight.

2178
01:32:24,970 --> 01:32:26,080
Do you think,
you know,

2179
01:32:26,081 --> 01:32:26,914
gone are the days of the huge dude who 
was just a physical phenom and now the 

2180
01:32:31,931 --> 01:32:32,764
smaller technical dues is that there's a
thought with the 265 pound weight class 

2181
01:32:37,931 --> 01:32:38,764
and the consensus thought seems to be 
that somewhere around 240 pounds is the 

2182
01:32:43,841 --> 01:32:46,390
magic number.
That's what they think.

2183
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:47,673
They think that 240 pounds is the amount
of weight that you have where you're 

2184
01:32:51,371 --> 01:32:54,430
strong enough that you can knock out any
man,

2185
01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:55,453
right?
But you have more endurance than a man 

2186
01:32:57,251 --> 01:33:02,040
that may be ways to 65 or heavier and 
cuts down to two 65 okay.

2187
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:02,943
Now this is not been substantiated.
The problem is there hasn't been a 

2188
01:33:07,181 --> 01:33:12,181
really super powerful world championship
athlete that weighed 265 pounds.

2189
01:33:13,450 --> 01:33:18,450
There's been brock Lesnar,
but brock Lesnar's enhanced,

2190
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:20,433
right?
You're dealing with a guy who tested 

2191
01:33:21,911 --> 01:33:25,570
positive for steroids.
He probably has had things and then this

2192
01:33:25,571 --> 01:33:26,560
is a new world.

2193
01:33:26,830 --> 01:33:30,130
He's also 40 years old now,
so it's impossible to tell what he would

2194
01:33:30,131 --> 01:33:30,964
have been like at 30 if he was clean.
And then you have guys like Francis and 

2195
01:33:34,481 --> 01:33:37,870
Ghana who was 265 pounds,
massive knockout artists,

2196
01:33:37,871 --> 01:33:42,871
natural 265 pounds but doesn't have the 
wrestling base got exposed and his fight

2197
01:33:43,481 --> 01:33:45,580
with Steve Bay Meo church and you can't 
knock you out.

2198
01:33:45,581 --> 01:33:48,340
He's kind of doomed and he tired out 
after the first round.

2199
01:33:48,430 --> 01:33:49,263
Okay,
so it's hard to say cause there's never 

2200
01:33:51,221 --> 01:33:54,280
been a 265 pound version of Cain 
Velasquez.

2201
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:55,630
Okay.
Cain Velasquez,

2202
01:33:55,870 --> 01:33:56,703
my humble opinion,
when I look at all of the different 

2203
01:33:59,381 --> 01:34:03,130
heavyweights that I've personally seen,
fight cane stands out as the best.

2204
01:34:03,550 --> 01:34:04,383
The reason why Keynes stands out as the 
best is because he has super human 

2205
01:34:07,061 --> 01:34:08,090
endurance.
Yeah.

2206
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:13,140
And his ability to put a pace on guys.
You would see these guys just wilt under

2207
01:34:13,451 --> 01:34:16,690
the pressure of,
and I think with cane,

2208
01:34:17,730 --> 01:34:19,210
this is where it gets really 
interesting.

2209
01:34:19,510 --> 01:34:20,343
What did him in is probably what also 
brought him to the top is his mental 

2210
01:34:23,651 --> 01:34:26,920
toughness because his body started 
breaking down.

2211
01:34:27,110 --> 01:34:29,080
He started having all these back 
injuries.

2212
01:34:29,081 --> 01:34:31,330
He needed back surgery,
multiple back surgeries,

2213
01:34:31,331 --> 01:34:32,890
shoulder surgery,
knee surgery,

2214
01:34:33,220 --> 01:34:34,053
everything was getting fucked up.
And I think it was getting fucked up 

2215
01:34:35,981 --> 01:34:36,814
cause he was working through pain and 
because he has the ability to tolerate 

2216
01:34:39,911 --> 01:34:44,530
pain that most people don't have and 
he's just a fucking animal.

2217
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:49,800
But that's also probably what led to him
having this insane endurance is the same

2218
01:34:51,131 --> 01:34:53,620
kind of mental toughness.
I'm sure there's some genetic advantages

2219
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:54,454
as well because they would talk about 
how he would take months off and come 

2220
01:34:56,831 --> 01:35:00,200
back still fuck everybody up because 
he's just that good.

2221
01:35:00,201 --> 01:35:01,034
But then also can be attributed to the 
cardio base that he had from competing 

2222
01:35:05,631 --> 01:35:06,291
for many,
many,

2223
01:35:06,291 --> 01:35:07,124
many,
many years at a high level and being 

2224
01:35:09,381 --> 01:35:12,500
known for that insane endurance and 
perception to fatigue.

2225
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:14,510
Going back,
if you could quantify that,

2226
01:35:14,511 --> 01:35:16,430
you'd put cane up there with one of 
those people.

2227
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:19,170
He has that in abundance.
Yes.

2228
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:20,073
Yes.
Anyone else in the heavyweights then 

2229
01:35:21,471 --> 01:35:24,680
would you say your core?
Me a for sure has tremendous,

2230
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:26,030
uh,
fatigue,

2231
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:26,893
uh,
ability to tolerate fatigue and for 

2232
01:35:28,071 --> 01:35:30,290
tremendous endurance.
And he breaks people,

2233
01:35:30,291 --> 01:35:31,700
you know,
they call him the king of the grind.

2234
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:33,500
And,
but on top of that,

2235
01:35:33,501 --> 01:35:34,334
they,
what they both have is tremendous 

2236
01:35:35,541 --> 01:35:36,850
wrestling technique.
The tree,

2237
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:39,500
the wrestling technique as well as the 
endurance.

2238
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:43,280
Everything plays a factor.
Jon Jones fits into that camp as well.

2239
01:35:43,490 --> 01:35:46,040
Jon Jones has tremendous wrestling 
technique as well.

2240
01:35:46,041 --> 01:35:48,500
Striking technique,
massive physical skills,

2241
01:35:48,501 --> 01:35:49,334
but also mental toughness.
His mental toughness is an 

2242
01:35:52,611 --> 01:35:54,220
unchallengeable.
You like you,

2243
01:35:54,221 --> 01:35:56,200
you absolutely have to give it up to 
him.

2244
01:35:56,220 --> 01:35:59,210
He's had his arm fucked up by Vito 
Belfort,

2245
01:35:59,211 --> 01:36:00,044
completely hyper extended,
refuse to tap and then went up tapping 

2246
01:36:02,610 --> 01:36:03,920
vietor with uh,
with uh,

2247
01:36:03,980 --> 01:36:04,850
uh,
Americana.

2248
01:36:04,850 --> 01:36:08,620
I believe it was the next round and a 
toe against Chael Sonnen.

2249
01:36:08,650 --> 01:36:11,120
Oh,
I was told was fucked up and even notice

2250
01:36:11,121 --> 01:36:13,430
it until I was interviewing him and I 
was interviewing him.

2251
01:36:13,431 --> 01:36:14,180
He looked down,
I like,

2252
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:15,400
Oh shit.
Look at my toe.

2253
01:36:15,401 --> 01:36:16,234
And he started going to shock.
Was it as bad as it was turned upside 

2254
01:36:19,071 --> 01:36:21,320
down?
It was completely turned upside down.

2255
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:22,400
I mean,
imagine that.

2256
01:36:22,401 --> 01:36:24,980
I mean if he wound up going into the 
next round,

2257
01:36:24,981 --> 01:36:25,814
if he didn't stop Chael Sonnen and his 
toe was that fucked up and he wound up 

2258
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:31,820
losing to chill son because his toe was 
bad.

2259
01:36:32,180 --> 01:36:33,700
That's insane.
Um,

2260
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:34,573
he also went through that fight with 
Alexander Gustafson where he wasn't 

2261
01:36:37,521 --> 01:36:38,354
really training very hard for that fight
and Gustafson one the first couple 

2262
01:36:42,441 --> 01:36:46,250
rounds and then Jon Jones won the last 
two to take it away.

2263
01:36:46,430 --> 01:36:47,263
And,
and I watched that back obviously with 

2264
01:36:47,781 --> 01:36:49,510
all the promotion at the moment,
and I think it was winkle,

2265
01:36:49,511 --> 01:36:51,960
John Jackson,
when he starts shouting heart hearts,

2266
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:52,830
you know,
shout out to,

2267
01:36:52,830 --> 01:36:54,050
and that was the,
that was the design.

2268
01:36:54,050 --> 01:36:54,883
I mean that's again an,
but that was the deciding factor that 

2269
01:36:56,541 --> 01:36:59,380
you come out and you produce that.
Yeah.

2270
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:01,220
Also in Jon Jones,
his favor,

2271
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:02,083
I believe he has to fucking super 
athlete brothers and they used to 

2272
01:37:06,110 --> 01:37:06,943
apparently beat the shit out of each 
other all the time and his brother's a 

2273
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:09,700
bigger than him.
Right.

2274
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:13,910
I think that is a factor because I think
that there's mental toughness that comes

2275
01:37:13,911 --> 01:37:18,020
from being around that kind of combat in
the household all the time.

2276
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:19,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

2277
01:37:19,191 --> 01:37:20,390
I think it's a bunch of different 
factors,

2278
01:37:20,810 --> 01:37:22,670
but it's,
it's Ho you,

2279
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:26,270
I don't know.
I think you can teach that.

2280
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:27,373
I don't believe that mental toughness is
something that you either have or you 

2281
01:37:30,771 --> 01:37:32,360
don't have.
I don't believe that.

2282
01:37:32,510 --> 01:37:33,343
I think you can teach it,
but you got to want it and you gotta be 

2283
01:37:36,441 --> 01:37:37,274
willing to learn.
You got to be able to bring yourself to 

2284
01:37:39,471 --> 01:37:42,050
a state of mind where you're 
unbreakable.

2285
01:37:42,350 --> 01:37:44,480
I think it's possible.
I really do.

2286
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:48,150
And some people just have that that is a
b.

2287
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:51,050
And I think they've developed it over 
long period of time.

2288
01:37:51,051 --> 01:37:51,884
And once they finally got to,
whether it's wrestling or Jujitsu or 

2289
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:56,100
mma,
they

2290
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:58,540
already had it.
And then they accentuated it and,

2291
01:37:58,550 --> 01:37:59,383
and,
and added onto it and then it got 

2292
01:38:00,481 --> 01:38:02,070
stronger and then they become known for 
it.

2293
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:05,190
Like that guy is just an animal.
He's just mentally strong.

2294
01:38:05,310 --> 01:38:08,790
But I think that mental strength comes 
from many life experiences.

2295
01:38:08,791 --> 01:38:09,624
And probably probably the guidance of 
their parents or some other role model 

2296
01:38:14,521 --> 01:38:15,354
in their life that also showed them 
incredible endurance and incredible 

2297
01:38:18,511 --> 01:38:19,710
discipline.
And this,

2298
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:23,910
this mental fortitude.
I think you can teach it though.

2299
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:25,850
I think,
you know,

2300
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:26,693
I said I don't,
I don't believe that it's something 

2301
01:38:28,171 --> 01:38:30,240
that's just either have or you don't 
have,

2302
01:38:30,241 --> 01:38:32,760
I think you either have it or you don't 
have it,

2303
01:38:32,761 --> 01:38:34,560
but you can get it.
That's what I think.

2304
01:38:34,850 --> 01:38:35,880
I,
you know,

2305
01:38:35,881 --> 01:38:38,170
I'm a huge fan of Dan Hardee.
We've been chatting since the,

2306
01:38:38,171 --> 01:38:43,020
the swim and I always go back to that on
Bob with the George Saint Pierre Ev.

2307
01:38:43,290 --> 01:38:45,630
Everybody would its hat.
Oh yeah.

2308
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:46,101
And,
and,

2309
01:38:46,101 --> 01:38:49,410
and I couldn't get my hat and I can't 
wait to catch up with Dan about that and

2310
01:38:49,411 --> 01:38:54,000
sort of exchange notes on this idea of 
mental fortitude because how he survived

2311
01:38:54,001 --> 01:38:54,840
that.
I mean,

2312
01:38:54,870 --> 01:38:56,750
it was,
it was,

2313
01:38:56,790 --> 01:38:59,040
yeah,
I was cringing watching.

2314
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:00,510
Well,
Dan's a savage.

2315
01:39:00,570 --> 01:39:01,171
I mean,
he's,

2316
01:39:01,171 --> 01:39:03,930
and he's an intelligent savage and you 
know,

2317
01:39:03,931 --> 01:39:04,830
he's,
um,

2318
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:10,040
he's not like a thug or a brutish guy.
He's a very well read,

2319
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,930
intelligent,
thoughtful guy.

2320
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:14,233
Um,
but he's also a guy that knows how to 

2321
01:39:17,221 --> 01:39:18,750
dig deep,
you know.

2322
01:39:18,751 --> 01:39:22,440
And you know when he fought George Saint
Pierre,

2323
01:39:22,441 --> 01:39:24,150
that was his big shot.
You know what I mean?

2324
01:39:24,151 --> 01:39:24,984
His big shot was against a guy who was 
at the time was in his prime and it was 

2325
01:39:29,580 --> 01:39:31,890
the greatest welterweight arguably of 
all time.

2326
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:34,410
I mean the argument is a,
it's between him,

2327
01:39:34,411 --> 01:39:38,450
Matt Hughes and I believe now tyron 
Woodley isn't that camp as well.

2328
01:39:38,450 --> 01:39:40,020
It's like the greatest welterweight 
ever.

2329
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:41,213
But you,
what you get out of Dan Hardy is a guy 

2330
01:39:43,531 --> 01:39:44,364
who's thought things through.
I mean it really comes through in his 

2331
01:39:46,081 --> 01:39:47,610
commentary.
This is a very,

2332
01:39:47,611 --> 01:39:48,444
very intelligent guy.
Would you say he's the same sort of cut 

2333
01:39:50,341 --> 01:39:51,174
from the same cloth as call me a them 
because I know Brendan's spoke about 

2334
01:39:53,281 --> 01:39:56,880
this recently saying he's the most 
intelligent fighter on the UFC roster at

2335
01:39:56,881 --> 01:39:57,990
the moment.
Carmia.

2336
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:01,170
Yeah.
But in his approach and his approach and

2337
01:40:01,171 --> 01:40:03,630
how he will break people button again,
you know,

2338
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:04,473
when you watch he in a UFC embedded in 
and stuff like you can't help but love 

2339
01:40:07,411 --> 01:40:09,660
calling me such a nice guy.
But,

2340
01:40:09,850 --> 01:40:12,660
and this goes back to what I suppose you
said about the swim,

2341
01:40:12,661 --> 01:40:13,351
you know,
when it was like,

2342
01:40:13,351 --> 01:40:13,751
oh you're,
you're,

2343
01:40:13,751 --> 01:40:16,020
you're very smart and stuff.
But I see that in call me,

2344
01:40:16,021 --> 01:40:16,854
he's the nicest guy,
but I would never get in the octagon 

2345
01:40:19,591 --> 01:40:19,920
with him.

2346
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:21,660
He don't know fooling anyone.
No,

2347
01:40:21,690 --> 01:40:24,500
he's a sweetheart until you're locked in
a cage.

2348
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:26,033
Fuck you up.
The difference between him and Dan 

2349
01:40:28,590 --> 01:40:31,590
Hardee though is that he's a world class
wrestler,

2350
01:40:31,770 --> 01:40:32,371
right?
I mean,

2351
01:40:32,371 --> 01:40:33,204
he was a two time Olympic team member 
and just one of the best wrestlers to 

2352
01:40:36,241 --> 01:40:37,074
ever compete in MMA.
And you really see that in a lot of his 

2353
01:40:39,271 --> 01:40:40,650
fights,
like the Derrick Lewis fight.

2354
01:40:40,770 --> 01:40:43,140
Derrick had no chance,
no chance,

2355
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:44,213
you know,
and Derek just knocked out Alexander 

2356
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:47,490
Volkov,
who in a lot of people's eyes,

2357
01:40:47,491 --> 01:40:48,324
including mine,
was one of the dark horses in the 

2358
01:40:49,351 --> 01:40:50,184
heavyweight division.
But Derek just did not belong in there 

2359
01:40:52,921 --> 01:40:54,820
with Cormier who was the light 
heavyweight champion.

2360
01:40:54,821 --> 01:40:56,510
And he carries a lot of fat on him.
Yeah,

2361
01:40:56,590 --> 01:40:58,580
he's mean.
And I think if,

2362
01:40:58,810 --> 01:40:59,643
if he wanted to,
if Daniel cormier really dedicated 

2363
01:41:02,801 --> 01:41:05,230
himself,
he could drop down to 185 pounds.

2364
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:08,170
I really believed that.
But he's just,

2365
01:41:08,630 --> 01:41:09,311
you know,
easy.

2366
01:41:09,311 --> 01:41:11,350
Why would,
he's a fucking heavyweight champion.

2367
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:14,890
That's the difference between him and D.
There's many differences between him and

2368
01:41:14,891 --> 01:41:16,720
Dan.
The success ratio is very different.

2369
01:41:17,150 --> 01:41:19,300
You know,
courtney has been extremely successful.

2370
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:20,860
The only guy who lost,
who is John Jones,

2371
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:22,300
you know,
so,

2372
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:24,040
but,
but I find that with rest,

2373
01:41:24,041 --> 01:41:24,874
and this is on a complete tangent here,
but when you talk about that mind body 

2374
01:41:28,121 --> 01:41:30,220
connection,
like so often they're seen as separate.

2375
01:41:30,221 --> 01:41:33,430
You're over an intellect or you're just 
a physical phenom.

2376
01:41:33,490 --> 01:41:35,950
Like it's rare that you see the two.
But when again,

2377
01:41:36,010 --> 01:41:37,870
ancient Greek philosophy,
you look at Plato,

2378
01:41:37,871 --> 01:41:40,780
like Plato was an accomplished,
celebrated wrestler.

2379
01:41:41,380 --> 01:41:43,600
I think he said something along the 
lines of,

2380
01:41:43,601 --> 01:41:44,434
you know,
you should wrestle to find the answers 

2381
01:41:45,311 --> 01:41:46,780
to that.
Philosophers seek.

2382
01:41:46,781 --> 01:41:47,920
It was,
it was something like that.

2383
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:50,170
It was such an advocate of it.
And,

2384
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:52,850
and I think,
and again this is coming from a,

2385
01:41:52,870 --> 01:41:53,703
you know,
sort of my limited background because 

2386
01:41:54,581 --> 01:41:57,730
obviously in in Britain we don't have,
have wrestling like over,

2387
01:41:58,060 --> 01:42:00,700
over here and stuff,
but there's something about wrestling it

2388
01:42:00,701 --> 01:42:01,534
seems,
or I suppose my question to you is like 

2389
01:42:03,191 --> 01:42:07,190
that it just teaches that like mental 
fortitude yeah.

2390
01:42:07,210 --> 01:42:08,230
Physically,
yeah.

2391
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:09,073
Neuromuscular efficiency and stuff,
but it seems to just produce this breed 

2392
01:42:13,271 --> 01:42:16,080
of humans that,
you know,

2393
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:16,963
it did you think is it's,
there's something about being face down 

2394
01:42:18,971 --> 01:42:19,804
in a matter.
Somebody just trying to contort your 

2395
01:42:21,791 --> 01:42:23,050
limbs,
you know,

2396
01:42:23,051 --> 01:42:25,450
so that took to go back to stress and 
stimulate,

2397
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:26,313
you know,
it's also building up that progressive 

2398
01:42:28,991 --> 01:42:30,730
overload and your own head.
Yes.

2399
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:31,593
That and what you just said there about 
experiences that that quite often now 

2400
01:42:35,801 --> 01:42:37,240
when I go swimming,
I'm like,

2401
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:38,583
it's not the courier Vecan I'm not 
wearing the jellyfish tentacle on my 

2402
01:42:40,721 --> 01:42:41,080
face.

2403
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:42,670
You know,
it's not that bad.

2404
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:45,880
And I think what did do you,
that's where my question is.

2405
01:42:45,881 --> 01:42:48,040
Do you think it's the same with 
wrestling that you like?

2406
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:51,220
I've been in a worse position than this,
I think for sure.

2407
01:42:51,310 --> 01:42:55,270
I think there's the,
the strength that they have,

2408
01:42:55,300 --> 01:42:56,133
the intellectual strength and when I say
intellectual strength there is actually 

2409
01:42:59,681 --> 01:43:03,340
solving puzzles and whether people 
understand it or not,

2410
01:43:03,450 --> 01:43:04,600
you look at wrestling,
you think,

2411
01:43:04,630 --> 01:43:05,463
oh,
it's brute force and strength and 

2412
01:43:07,031 --> 01:43:08,800
endurance,
but they're solving puzzles,

2413
01:43:08,950 --> 01:43:10,390
right?
There's setting traps.

2414
01:43:10,630 --> 01:43:14,770
They're trying to set up techniques and 
they're doing this under heavy workload,

2415
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:16,000
right?
They're exhausted,

2416
01:43:16,001 --> 01:43:16,834
their heart's pounding and they're 
resisting 100% with another person is 

2417
01:43:19,781 --> 01:43:20,614
resisting 100% when you see guys tie up 
and throwing each other around and 

2418
01:43:24,401 --> 01:43:25,234
they're fucking digging their toes into 
the mat and wrenching as a tremendous 

2419
01:43:29,651 --> 01:43:33,070
amount of force that they have to keep 
up for minutes and minutes at a time.

2420
01:43:33,610 --> 01:43:38,020
And I think a lot of that has to do with
your ability to maintain intensity.

2421
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:39,093
And a lot of that has to do with your 
ability to tolerate being exhausted and 

2422
01:43:41,981 --> 01:43:42,814
tolerate fatigue and to force yourself 
into an in a highly aggressive and 

2423
01:43:47,951 --> 01:43:52,070
efficient mindset and to be able to 
maintain proper technique under

2424
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:53,600
fatigue.
That's a good point.

2425
01:43:53,670 --> 01:43:56,420
Technique and intelligence.
I believe again with the Royal Marines,

2426
01:43:56,421 --> 01:44:01,421
we can be a Wa when training with them.
I find that it's crazy how you,

2427
01:44:02,071 --> 01:44:04,850
you will have the cognitive functioning 
of a five year old,

2428
01:44:04,851 --> 01:44:05,990
you know,
you are compliant,

2429
01:44:06,010 --> 01:44:06,843
right?
You're in a 30 mile yacht with 50 kg on 

2430
01:44:08,751 --> 01:44:09,584
your backpack and somebody asks you some
really complex question and your 

2431
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:12,990
dislikes,
you know,

2432
01:44:13,010 --> 01:44:14,720
I don't know.
And,

2433
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:17,120
and I think it's certainly going back to
the swim,

2434
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:19,580
uh,
there's times where I said to the team,

2435
01:44:19,581 --> 01:44:20,361
I was like,
please,

2436
01:44:20,361 --> 01:44:21,194
like when,
when I'm six hours into a swim through 

2437
01:44:23,031 --> 01:44:25,760
the night,
I need just really clear instructions,

2438
01:44:25,761 --> 01:44:28,670
just like raw swim this way.
Ron's Rosslyn that direction.

2439
01:44:28,671 --> 01:44:31,220
And again,
purely anecdotal for the moment,

2440
01:44:31,221 --> 01:44:32,054
but you know,
I love cowboys serone and there's times 

2441
01:44:34,071 --> 01:44:37,100
when he's just in his corner and he's 
just having a full on comedy.

2442
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:38,850
So relaxed,
you know?

2443
01:44:38,870 --> 01:44:41,810
And it's just like that you,
you could see somebody probably fatigued

2444
01:44:41,811 --> 01:44:45,370
and they're panicking and he's just 
sitting on the stool.

2445
01:44:45,371 --> 01:44:47,750
Like he's got great deference to that.
That helps.

2446
01:44:47,751 --> 01:44:50,720
That certainly helps his ability to 
recover and rounds.

2447
01:44:50,740 --> 01:44:51,573
And you see his fight this weekend,
I've got to catch up on it was 

2448
01:44:54,770 --> 01:44:56,540
sensational.
The best he's ever looked.

2449
01:44:56,570 --> 01:44:58,910
But he was on the bottom when Perry can,
when,

2450
01:44:58,940 --> 01:44:59,391
yeah.
I mean,

2451
01:44:59,391 --> 01:45:00,800
Perry took him down,
but he said to me,

2452
01:45:00,801 --> 01:45:01,371
he goes,
he goes,

2453
01:45:01,371 --> 01:45:02,420
he started taking me down.
I was like,

2454
01:45:02,421 --> 01:45:03,290
Shit,
I'm going to let him.

2455
01:45:04,010 --> 01:45:05,250
He said,
I'll let them take me down.

2456
01:45:05,251 --> 01:45:07,770
And then he reversed them immediately 
and got him in an arm bar and,

2457
01:45:07,771 --> 01:45:10,790
and broke his arm.
He snapped his forum and half he sent me

2458
01:45:10,791 --> 01:45:13,620
the x rays.
No,

2459
01:45:15,490 --> 01:45:16,980
I don't think anybody's seen this.
I don't,

2460
01:45:16,990 --> 01:45:20,610
sorry Donald,
I'm sending us from not supposed to send

2461
01:45:20,611 --> 01:45:21,444
us.

2462
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:23,160
Oh Shit.
Um,

2463
01:45:23,210 --> 01:45:24,043
yeah,
we'd been going back and forth and you 

2464
01:45:24,981 --> 01:45:25,701
know,
for him,

2465
01:45:25,701 --> 01:45:29,030
I think it was a matter of rekindling 
his excitement.

2466
01:45:29,031 --> 01:45:30,320
Here it is.
Yeah.

2467
01:45:30,321 --> 01:45:32,840
It was a pretty emotional person.
Oh,

2468
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:33,733
that hurts.
Right.

2469
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:35,293
Can you see that?
You want me to send it to you or I'll 

2470
01:45:37,221 --> 01:45:38,054
send it to you,
Jamie?

2471
01:45:38,450 --> 01:45:42,710
Um,
also I think with Donald when it comes,

2472
01:45:42,711 --> 01:45:46,070
we were talking about stimulation and 
motivation.

2473
01:45:46,250 --> 01:45:47,083
He has a son now is a little baby son.
And he brought his son into the octagon 

2474
01:45:50,121 --> 01:45:53,510
with him and celebrating with his son.
He just seemed different to me.

2475
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:56,780
He seemed different in his poise,
completely in control.

2476
01:45:57,050 --> 01:46:00,290
The guys fighting Mike Perry is fucking 
dangerous.

2477
01:46:00,350 --> 01:46:02,510
It's fucking dangerous.
He hits really hard.

2478
01:46:02,750 --> 01:46:06,110
He's very aggressive.
And a donald just handled them.

2479
01:46:06,270 --> 01:46:07,103
And,
and Perry took him down I think because 

2480
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:10,910
he didn't like what was going on standup
wise.

2481
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:13,310
He just snapped that shit.

2482
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:14,910
But that,
but you mentioned there as well.

2483
01:46:14,911 --> 01:46:15,744
We saw Bernie talking about his son and 
it was such an emotional post that he 

2484
01:46:17,881 --> 01:46:19,260
posted on instagram.
And I loved it.

2485
01:46:19,261 --> 01:46:19,710
And,
and,

2486
01:46:19,710 --> 01:46:24,710
and going back to what you said about 
finding something that,

2487
01:46:25,170 --> 01:46:28,800
that alters your biochemistry,
you know,

2488
01:46:28,801 --> 01:46:31,380
and now that he's fighting for something
and you know,

2489
01:46:31,381 --> 01:46:32,330
he's,
he's got his kid.

2490
01:46:32,331 --> 01:46:33,480
Do you,
did you think that's,

2491
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:36,570
that's what we were talking about music 
before.

2492
01:46:36,571 --> 01:46:37,800
We were talking about getting his 
mindset.

2493
01:46:37,801 --> 01:46:40,410
It may be use caffeine,
like whatever it is,

2494
01:46:40,650 --> 01:46:44,100
but something you think is now different
in serone because again,

2495
01:46:44,190 --> 01:46:46,200
it's love.
Yeah.

2496
01:46:46,230 --> 01:46:47,420
Yeah.
The love of his children,

2497
01:46:47,430 --> 01:46:49,750
his children,
he has something that he,

2498
01:46:49,770 --> 01:46:49,980
what

2499
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:51,600
he said was,
um,

2500
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:54,210
I never knew what I was fighting for.
I said,

2501
01:46:54,211 --> 01:46:55,044
now I have something to fight for.
I think he was fighting for excitement 

2502
01:46:57,271 --> 01:47:00,220
before for thrills cause he's a,
he's a thrill seek,

2503
01:47:00,221 --> 01:47:01,054
you said wild motherfucker.
He likes jet skiing and jump and 

2504
01:47:04,381 --> 01:47:08,190
snowmobiles off the side of mountains 
and he's an animal week before a fight.

2505
01:47:08,370 --> 01:47:09,930
But yeah,
he doesn't give a fuck.

2506
01:47:10,050 --> 01:47:12,090
He doesn't,
but this is a different thing.

2507
01:47:12,290 --> 01:47:16,200
What he's doing in,
in this fight in particular,

2508
01:47:16,201 --> 01:47:19,290
I think this is a different thing 
because he's fighting for his son.

2509
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:23,730
I mean he's got this family now and it 
means the world to him and he looks over

2510
01:47:23,731 --> 01:47:24,564
at this guy like this guy is trying to 
take food from his family and he just 

2511
01:47:28,411 --> 01:47:30,960
wasn't efficient assassin.
It was just,

2512
01:47:31,050 --> 01:47:32,340
it was beautiful to watch.
It was like,

2513
01:47:32,341 --> 01:47:34,380
I think the best performance of his 
career.

2514
01:47:35,130 --> 01:47:35,963
And you know,
maybe Mike Perry is not as good as 

2515
01:47:37,621 --> 01:47:38,454
Darren till or is Hofeld Asan Joe's or 
some of the other people that he's 

2516
01:47:41,101 --> 01:47:41,934
fought in the past,
but it's fucking dangerous and he's a 

2517
01:47:43,681 --> 01:47:47,970
legit welterweight were Donald's not 
donald can fight it 155 pounds.

2518
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:49,950
It's one of the things Donald said after
the fight,

2519
01:47:49,951 --> 01:47:50,784
he said,
Khabib,

2520
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:51,840
he goes,
I'm back.

2521
01:47:51,841 --> 01:47:52,674
I'm coming for you.
So he wants to drop down to one 55 and 

2522
01:47:54,631 --> 01:47:56,420
fight could be,
do you think he might know something?

2523
01:47:56,421 --> 01:47:57,254
It's different.
Do you think you didn't think he could 

2524
01:47:58,411 --> 01:47:59,210
make a taller one?
Well,

2525
01:47:59,210 --> 01:48:01,140
it was a man.
Khabib is the motherfuckers.

2526
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:02,900
All motherfuckers,
you know,

2527
01:48:03,030 --> 01:48:05,060
I mean,
who's going to beat that dude?

2528
01:48:05,061 --> 01:48:05,894
But that dude molly was aspirin maybe,
but aspirin is a different weight Class 

2529
01:48:09,811 --> 01:48:14,811
C aspirins 70 and could bebes 55 if 
Khabib and ask an agreed to a catch line

2530
01:48:15,430 --> 01:48:16,230
is fine.

2531
01:48:16,230 --> 01:48:17,063
That is absolutely a possibility.
And absolutely a possibility that ask 

2532
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:21,493
him could best him.
Because if someone's going to beat 

2533
01:48:22,891 --> 01:48:23,724
Khabib,
it's going to be someone who is a 

2534
01:48:24,131 --> 01:48:28,380
superior wrestler and ask her,
and it is a mother fucker of a wrestler.

2535
01:48:28,650 --> 01:48:29,483
But is he better than can be?
We really don't know and we will not 

2536
01:48:31,921 --> 01:48:33,090
know until he,
they,

2537
01:48:33,180 --> 01:48:34,013
they fight.
But I do have to say that Khabib in the 

2538
01:48:36,751 --> 01:48:40,530
training camp at Aka,
this is coming straight from [inaudible]

2539
01:48:40,710 --> 01:48:43,710
and a bunch of other people that are 
trained with him say that he trains with

2540
01:48:43,711 --> 01:48:46,380
Olympic caliber wrestlers and fucks them
up.

2541
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:50,390
That's how good could be Biz Khabib is.
He is.

2542
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:54,930
He's so God damned good on the ground 
when he gets a hold of guys,

2543
01:48:54,931 --> 01:48:55,764
they look perplexed and I always bring 
up the Edson Barboza fight cause a 

2544
01:48:59,101 --> 01:48:59,934
moment in the Barboza fight in the first
round where he'd that thousand yard 

2545
01:49:02,131 --> 01:49:02,964
stare where Khabib had taken him down.
He was mauling him and he looked over 

2546
01:49:05,971 --> 01:49:06,804
the distance like how the fuck am I 
going to get through three rounds of 

2547
01:49:08,311 --> 01:49:09,144
this shit?

2548
01:49:09,170 --> 01:49:11,120
Yeah.
And that's the thing with Barboza.

2549
01:49:11,121 --> 01:49:13,710
I mean Terry added that kick.
He just want,

2550
01:49:15,860 --> 01:49:18,740
yeah.
So to see that it was just,

2551
01:49:18,741 --> 01:49:21,970
I mean it felt like if I was to do mixed
martial arts,

2552
01:49:21,980 --> 01:49:24,140
did you just,
I know you spoke about it before,

2553
01:49:24,141 --> 01:49:26,750
you said if somebody doesn't know you 
know what they're doing like,

2554
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:29,910
like me,
it's like drowning and,

2555
01:49:29,950 --> 01:49:30,783
and that's exactly how I would feel.
I think it was just humbling and it's 

2556
01:49:36,300 --> 01:49:37,133
something that you

2557
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:38,153
learn.
See the thing of what you've done in my 

2558
01:49:40,411 --> 01:49:43,350
eyes,
what you've done is so difficult.

2559
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:46,410
I think you could do anything.
I really do.

2560
01:49:46,470 --> 01:49:51,470
I think what you did by forcing yourself
to do that shit for six hours a day,

2561
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:52,713
take a break six hours again to do 12 
hours of swimming everyday for five 

2562
01:49:56,681 --> 01:49:59,230
fucking months.
That kind of mental fortitude,

2563
01:49:59,231 --> 01:50:00,064
if someone just taught you,
I mean you obviously you're very 

2564
01:50:02,141 --> 01:50:06,130
physically strong and fit.
If someone just taught you technique and

2565
01:50:06,131 --> 01:50:08,830
taught you how to grapple and taught you
kickboxing,

2566
01:50:08,831 --> 01:50:09,664
you would be a motherfucker at it 
because your mind is so strong like 

2567
01:50:12,890 --> 01:50:14,900
that,
that you know,

2568
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:15,753
there's a different mindset to have that
same kind of mind strength with the 

2569
01:50:18,881 --> 01:50:21,080
adversity of another human being.
Trying to kill you.

2570
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:22,330
See,
that's the thing.

2571
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:25,450
How well do people deal with other 
people's,

2572
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:26,793
like there's something about a person 
breathing down your neck that's trying 

2573
01:50:29,141 --> 01:50:31,060
to choke you.
That's very disconcerting.

2574
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:34,030
But if you can get past that and I think
you could,

2575
01:50:34,270 --> 01:50:36,180
you would be a motherfucker at anything 
you did.

2576
01:50:36,390 --> 01:50:37,780
And that's actually the thing.
I mean,

2577
01:50:37,781 --> 01:50:40,720
even at the moment now I'm used to,
uh,

2578
01:50:41,130 --> 01:50:41,963
just training for 12 hours a day.
So right now I'm still sort of in Bi 

2579
01:50:45,821 --> 01:50:48,160
phasic sleep.
So I've only been on land really a week,

2580
01:50:48,161 --> 01:50:49,970
so that's crazy.
Yeah.

2581
01:50:49,971 --> 01:50:51,820
So were you sleeping in a boat this 
whole time?

2582
01:50:53,060 --> 01:50:53,893
Is Six hours.
What is it like to have the ground not 

2583
01:50:57,251 --> 01:50:59,470
move the hog,
the standing boom?

2584
01:50:59,590 --> 01:51:00,910
Honestly,
when I go on I was,

2585
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:05,940
I mean I was doing media interviews and 
everything was swaying like they said,

2586
01:51:06,360 --> 01:51:07,990
but even even that night,
my first night,

2587
01:51:07,991 --> 01:51:08,710
the,
the bed,

2588
01:51:08,710 --> 01:51:11,590
it sounds so weird,
but the bed was just a bit too stable.

2589
01:51:11,591 --> 01:51:13,390
It's a bit too comfy.
Wow.

2590
01:51:13,391 --> 01:51:16,240
I woke up in the middle of the night,
I was with my girlfriend and I'm looking

2591
01:51:16,241 --> 01:51:17,670
for my goggles,
you know,

2592
01:51:17,710 --> 01:51:19,990
thinking of the time is about to change 
that to jump back in.

2593
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:22,090
Wow.
She's like go back to bed.

2594
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:22,933
And like,
honestly I say it now like sort of 

2595
01:51:24,401 --> 01:51:26,320
joking,
but there was a real element of,

2596
01:51:26,321 --> 01:51:29,710
you know,
just that you'd been conditioned and all

2597
01:51:29,711 --> 01:51:32,140
I really cared about.
Soon as I woke up,

2598
01:51:32,390 --> 01:51:34,600
I want to end just to know what the 
tides were doing.

2599
01:51:34,870 --> 01:51:36,580
You know,
what's,

2600
01:51:36,581 --> 01:51:37,690
where's it running?
How,

2601
01:51:37,730 --> 01:51:38,620
when does it start?
When does it,

2602
01:51:38,621 --> 01:51:39,454
how have we got good title,
bad side does it spring tides or neat 

2603
01:51:41,171 --> 01:51:42,570
tie.
So spring ty's been stronger,

2604
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:45,010
neat type spaces and that was my 
currency.

2605
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:45,993
That's all I cared about.
And it was really strange that you to 

2606
01:51:49,951 --> 01:51:53,050
try now and integrate back into society.
You know,

2607
01:51:53,290 --> 01:51:55,450
even just walking through La,
the cars,

2608
01:51:55,451 --> 01:51:57,910
everything moves very fast now.
You know,

2609
01:51:57,911 --> 01:52:01,300
when you kind of come back and it's um,
it's a bit of a shock.

2610
01:52:01,570 --> 01:52:02,560
It's a real,
real shit.

2611
01:52:02,980 --> 01:52:06,770
You're in an alternate universe or 
something like to go through five months

2612
01:52:06,771 --> 01:52:09,740
of one reality and then to come out on 
the other end.

2613
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:11,100
Yeah,
it does.

2614
01:52:11,130 --> 01:52:11,963
So what I almost,
but then even it's an intrinsically or 

2615
01:52:15,211 --> 01:52:16,044
something,
my body's used to work in hard for 12 

2616
01:52:18,541 --> 01:52:21,030
hours a day and just getting battered by
waves with the moment,

2617
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:22,133
you know,
I'm sort of sitting here and I've been 

2618
01:52:23,581 --> 01:52:25,200
doing media,
we can spend amazing,

2619
01:52:25,201 --> 01:52:27,410
but there's an element of me just kind 
of go in,

2620
01:52:27,750 --> 01:52:28,583
I need to use this work capacity.
And so I am sort of training at the 

2621
01:52:30,871 --> 01:52:32,130
moment.
The first session I did,

2622
01:52:32,131 --> 01:52:35,470
I was in there for like six hours and 
hours and they were like the gym shut.

2623
01:52:35,471 --> 01:52:36,660
He knows.
And I was just like,

2624
01:52:36,690 --> 01:52:37,523
oh,
okay.

2625
01:52:40,220 --> 01:52:40,820
Crazy.

2626
01:52:40,820 --> 01:52:41,653
There is the element.
So one of the things that we all talked 

2627
01:52:43,521 --> 01:52:46,940
about after sober October was none of us
had ever done anything like this before,

2628
01:52:46,941 --> 01:52:47,774
but we're worried now that we're going 
to go back to our sedentary ways and 

2629
01:52:50,571 --> 01:52:52,520
then we're to lose all this work that we
put in.

2630
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:53,840
Right.
Because at the end of the month,

2631
01:52:53,870 --> 01:52:55,910
Ari,
who had never worked out before,

2632
01:52:56,090 --> 01:52:58,760
ran 15 miles road,
five kilometers,

2633
01:52:58,761 --> 01:53:01,700
and then got on the bike for a while.
I forget what he did on the bike,

2634
01:53:01,820 --> 01:53:03,680
but I think he did at least a mile on 
the bike.

2635
01:53:04,190 --> 01:53:09,190
And this was a four plus hour workout.
But he had never done anything before.

2636
01:53:10,730 --> 01:53:11,201
I mean,
he had,

2637
01:53:11,201 --> 01:53:12,820
did you Jitsu?
I,

2638
01:53:12,900 --> 01:53:14,780
uh,
bought him some Jujitsu lessons.

2639
01:53:14,781 --> 01:53:16,660
I bought him a year at 10th Planet Jiu 
Jitsu,

2640
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:21,650
like 10 years ago,
but he went for a while and then he hurt

2641
01:53:21,651 --> 01:53:22,484
his knee and stopped going.
But he was 10 years of nothing and he's 

2642
01:53:27,381 --> 01:53:31,820
fucking 40 something years old and he 
forced himself through mental fortitude.

2643
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:32,713
So he's shit.

2644
01:53:32,740 --> 01:53:33,341
I mean,
we're,

2645
01:53:33,341 --> 01:53:35,890
so like the human body I find is so 
lazy.

2646
01:53:35,891 --> 01:53:36,724
Like we love homeostasis.
I habitual level what we're used to 

2647
01:53:38,831 --> 01:53:39,700
doing,
you know,

2648
01:53:39,701 --> 01:53:43,000
that status quo.
And then so when you do shift that,

2649
01:53:43,001 --> 01:53:45,580
and it's all relative because you know,
it can be,

2650
01:53:45,910 --> 01:53:48,580
you know,
swimming for 12 hours a day and stuff.

2651
01:53:48,581 --> 01:53:52,120
But it's relative.
And I think when you do shift that,

2652
01:53:52,340 --> 01:53:56,200
um,
it is hard and I think you have to be so

2653
01:53:56,201 --> 01:53:59,770
conscious of that.
So even now are like for instance,

2654
01:54:00,310 --> 01:54:01,820
my legs at the moment,
um,

2655
01:54:02,270 --> 01:54:03,011
you know,
shrunk,

2656
01:54:03,011 --> 01:54:05,470
but not just my legs.
I mean I essentially skip leg day,

2657
01:54:05,700 --> 01:54:07,690
you know,
for 157 days,

2658
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:09,313
your arms must be jacked is kind of it.
So we went into the gym the other day 

2659
01:54:13,061 --> 01:54:15,220
and because of the ligaments,
tendons,

2660
01:54:15,221 --> 01:54:19,390
but not only just generating force like 
a bench press,

2661
01:54:19,690 --> 01:54:22,600
but if you imagine like 40 knots of 
wind,

2662
01:54:22,601 --> 01:54:24,130
you know,
windover tie that we were talking,

2663
01:54:24,550 --> 01:54:29,140
my shoulders are used to being contorted
in ways that they shouldn't be shoulders

2664
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:30,460
a resisting the winners.

2665
01:54:30,460 --> 01:54:33,700
It's coming towards me.
So your exactly your shoulders.

2666
01:54:33,730 --> 01:54:34,563
Yeah.
And the amount of times I would take a 

2667
01:54:35,441 --> 01:54:36,221
stroke and then,
uh,

2668
01:54:36,221 --> 01:54:37,054
when,
I mean there's times when the waves hit 

2669
01:54:38,411 --> 01:54:41,050
me so hard,
I thought I've just hit a boat,

2670
01:54:41,140 --> 01:54:41,973
you know,
I hit something and that would be 

2671
01:54:42,830 --> 01:54:45,010
pointless.
It was that resistance as well.

2672
01:54:45,011 --> 01:54:46,190
So,
um,

2673
01:54:46,300 --> 01:54:49,510
on the bench press it was just kind of 
like took one 60,

2674
01:54:49,780 --> 01:54:50,613
you know,
I'm not saying it's necessarily just as 

2675
01:54:52,991 --> 01:54:53,824
a sort of sports science experiment.
I kind of unlifted and then just took 

2676
01:54:55,481 --> 01:54:58,630
one 60 kilos just for a ride and it just
kind of felt,

2677
01:54:58,631 --> 01:55:00,630
okay,
what's the one 60 kilos,

2678
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:03,900
what does 160 kilos in?
Sorry Jamie.

2679
01:55:05,950 --> 01:55:08,350
But then equally my legs,
you know,

2680
01:55:08,351 --> 01:55:10,700
in the Scott Hunt barely lifted my own 
body weight,

2681
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:15,430
53 53 58 reps says he,
it's that,

2682
01:55:15,431 --> 01:55:16,264
that sort of strength and muscle you had
lifted weights in five months and yet 

2683
01:55:19,050 --> 01:55:21,120
your upper body.
But,

2684
01:55:21,121 --> 01:55:21,954
but,
but,

2685
01:55:23,010 --> 01:55:24,760
but lower body.
No,

2686
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,770
you know,
and it's not even that though.

2687
01:55:26,771 --> 01:55:27,610
Like,
you know,

2688
01:55:27,611 --> 01:55:28,540
my legs,
it's the,

2689
01:55:28,541 --> 01:55:30,370
it's the,
it's my feet as well.

2690
01:55:30,371 --> 01:55:31,204
So right now genuinely,
and a lot of people afterwards were 

2691
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:34,330
like,
what are you going to do next?

2692
01:55:34,450 --> 01:55:35,370
You know,
what's the next adventure?

2693
01:55:35,371 --> 01:55:37,120
And I said,
I've got to learn to walk again.

2694
01:55:37,480 --> 01:55:38,910
And everyone laughed and I was like,
no,

2695
01:55:38,911 --> 01:55:39,221
no,
no.

2696
01:55:39,221 --> 01:55:41,460
Like the,
the arches in my foot of collapsed,

2697
01:55:41,461 --> 01:55:44,160
those ligaments.
And so

2698
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:44,911
it's,
I mean,

2699
01:55:44,911 --> 01:55:47,190
I think a lot of collapse just from not 
standing.

2700
01:55:47,430 --> 01:55:47,940
Yeah.
I mean,

2701
01:55:47,940 --> 01:55:48,773
yeah,
you got to think 12 hours in the water 

2702
01:55:50,371 --> 01:55:51,930
every day.
But even when I was on the boat,

2703
01:55:51,931 --> 01:55:54,690
I was probably eating or sleeping.
Whoa.

2704
01:55:54,691 --> 01:55:57,630
I didn't even think about that.
So your load capacity,

2705
01:55:57,631 --> 01:56:01,530
like your ability to like hold your body
weight up as diminished.

2706
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:02,693
I almost entered into this small group 
of people like astronauts where you've 

2707
01:56:06,841 --> 01:56:09,930
been in a non weight bearing environment
for so long.

2708
01:56:09,931 --> 01:56:13,170
So I joke and when we watched that video
back and I'll say,

2709
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:14,040
Oh jazz,
you know,

2710
01:56:14,041 --> 01:56:16,890
try not to fall over.
They're genuinely,

2711
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:19,970
I was thinking,
please don't just fall over with all the

2712
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:20,833
counter and laughing.
You know the thing that intrigues me is 

2713
01:56:23,821 --> 01:56:25,590
you're a young guy,
you're,

2714
01:56:25,591 --> 01:56:26,424
you're not,
a lot of these endurance guys are old 

2715
01:56:28,741 --> 01:56:29,670
angry people.

2716
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:32,033
They get older and they develop this 
ability to just fucking fuck the world 

2717
01:56:36,210 --> 01:56:36,980
and,
and,

2718
01:56:36,980 --> 01:56:38,880
and push through things.
How old are you?

2719
01:56:39,150 --> 01:56:42,330
33 yeah.
That's very young to do what you did,

2720
01:56:42,450 --> 01:56:43,520
isn't it?
Yeah.

2721
01:56:43,521 --> 01:56:44,960
And I think you're right,
actually.

2722
01:56:44,961 --> 01:56:48,210
I know that that would be a really good 
point to make that,

2723
01:56:48,211 --> 01:56:51,480
that I always think when people say I'm 
too old now to train and stuff,

2724
01:56:51,481 --> 01:56:53,820
I'm like absolutely no when yes,
granted,

2725
01:56:53,821 --> 01:56:56,280
when you're younger and plasticity and 
your ligaments,

2726
01:56:56,281 --> 01:56:57,510
yeah.
Higher Testosterone,

2727
01:56:57,511 --> 01:56:59,670
muscle mass ability to uh,
you know,

2728
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:01,230
increase my semesters.
I've absolutely,

2729
01:57:01,231 --> 01:57:04,350
but when you're older,
and to your point there,

2730
01:57:04,351 --> 01:57:05,550
Joe,
when you look at these,

2731
01:57:05,551 --> 01:57:06,870
you know,
backing the fell running,

2732
01:57:06,871 --> 01:57:10,620
which was talking about you get these 
guys who just look like they live in the

2733
01:57:10,621 --> 01:57:11,720
mountains,
you know,

2734
01:57:11,730 --> 01:57:14,130
whether they faces,
you know,

2735
01:57:14,270 --> 01:57:15,103
their carbs are just like this just 
thick carves and they have that 

2736
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:22,710
cappelary density that like 
mitochondrial efficiency,

2737
01:57:22,711 --> 01:57:24,120
movement efficiency.

2738
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:24,953
So they're cardio risk spiritually.
Durrance has just been built up from 

2739
01:57:28,471 --> 01:57:31,950
years and years and,
and these sorts of people as well there.

2740
01:57:31,970 --> 01:57:34,590
They almost,
they loved the mountains and,

2741
01:57:34,591 --> 01:57:35,424
and running so much that they don't care
that they're overtraining or like they 

2742
01:57:37,981 --> 01:57:40,260
need a rest.
That mother Fucker,

2743
01:57:41,670 --> 01:57:42,980
there we go.
Honestly,

2744
01:57:42,990 --> 01:57:46,110
she's crying when I'm throwing an rm 
getting lapped,

2745
01:57:46,170 --> 01:57:51,170
you know,
by John Nailer that that's fell running.

2746
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:54,340
Yeah,
I run into a gay bath house.

2747
01:57:56,160 --> 01:58:01,160
Other wasn't a short shorts,
no shorts.

2748
01:58:01,811 --> 01:58:04,830
So you get bed fell running shows you 
have to wear those shorts.

2749
01:58:05,150 --> 01:58:07,140
They're not compulsory.
Seems like it is.

2750
01:58:07,141 --> 01:58:08,610
And you've got numbers next to your 
deck.

2751
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:11,240
That's where too.
I would have brought you in Paris.

2752
01:58:12,660 --> 01:58:14,340
Come on Bro.
Those are,

2753
01:58:14,341 --> 01:58:17,630
those are shorts or the girls were in a 
porno movie there.

2754
01:58:17,670 --> 01:58:19,650
It makes sense,
Jim and uniform.

2755
01:58:19,740 --> 01:58:20,573
Oh,
okay.

2756
01:58:23,940 --> 01:58:26,430
I mean if he,
if he's possibly Jamie,

2757
01:58:26,490 --> 01:58:28,120
there's the um,
uh,

2758
01:58:28,230 --> 01:58:31,980
it's called the Bob Graham.
So there's a famous fowl race going back

2759
01:58:31,981 --> 01:58:32,814
to sort of the bog march.
There's a famous fell raced back in 

2760
01:58:34,351 --> 01:58:36,000
England called the Bob Graham.
And uh,

2761
01:58:36,330 --> 01:58:38,220
you know,
legend has it.

2762
01:58:38,221 --> 01:58:39,240
There was a guy,
Bob Graham,

2763
01:58:39,241 --> 01:58:40,320
and he sort of said,
you know,

2764
01:58:40,321 --> 01:58:41,110
I,
I,

2765
01:58:41,110 --> 01:58:42,040
I can do 44

2766
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:45,280
peaks in the Lake district and under 24 
hours and there were an internet,

2767
01:58:45,310 --> 01:58:46,360
that's not possible.
It's not possible.

2768
01:58:46,361 --> 01:58:46,751
I said,
yeah.

2769
01:58:46,751 --> 01:58:49,360
So it was like a bet in a pub.
And they were like,

2770
01:58:49,361 --> 01:58:50,410
yeah.
And sure enough,

2771
01:58:50,411 --> 01:58:51,244
that's what he did.
And so there's this race now called the 

2772
01:58:53,410 --> 01:58:55,180
Bob Graham,
and it's amazing and that it's,

2773
01:58:55,420 --> 01:59:00,090
it's steeped in history and heritage is 
that there's a hall in Kazic,

2774
01:59:00,091 --> 01:59:01,780
which is a small town.
It's called Moot Hall.

2775
01:59:02,170 --> 01:59:03,660
And if you were standing there,
Joe,

2776
01:59:03,661 --> 01:59:05,450
and you're in your running gear with 
those shorts,

2777
01:59:06,380 --> 01:59:07,213
but you were running though with your 
running gear and you had your hand on 

2778
01:59:09,701 --> 01:59:11,950
Moot Hall and you were looking at your 
watch like that,

2779
01:59:12,220 --> 01:59:14,230
runners would walk past you and just be 
like,

2780
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:14,821
oh,
he's,

2781
01:59:14,821 --> 01:59:16,420
he's about to do is Bob Graham.
You know,

2782
01:59:16,421 --> 01:59:18,640
they'd come over and there's that real 
solidarity,

2783
01:59:18,641 --> 01:59:20,560
that good luck,
good luck.

2784
01:59:21,780 --> 01:59:24,070
And then you have to do it in 24 hours.
Um,

2785
01:59:24,490 --> 01:59:25,840
and uh,
billy bland,

2786
01:59:25,841 --> 01:59:27,730
who was the one who,
who set the record,

2787
01:59:27,731 --> 01:59:30,970
which is only just been beaten by Kilian
jewel net who uh,

2788
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:33,460
uh,
recently ran up everest as well,

2789
01:59:33,461 --> 01:59:35,970
but I think he,
I'm fucking Saturday.

2790
01:59:35,980 --> 01:59:37,930
Yeah.
So many savages.

2791
01:59:37,931 --> 01:59:39,340
Our base.
So this,

2792
01:59:39,341 --> 01:59:41,830
and what I love about this is,
um,

2793
01:59:41,860 --> 01:59:42,341
oh,
there you go.

2794
01:59:42,341 --> 01:59:42,880
Is that,
yeah.

2795
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:43,780
Kilian yeah,
there you go.

2796
01:59:43,781 --> 01:59:45,820
Killing and your net.
So the guy behind in the blue,

2797
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:47,013
um,
set the record and then it says there I 

2798
01:59:48,671 --> 01:59:49,504
needed to suffer.
So Kilian join net after breaking the 

2799
01:59:51,761 --> 01:59:54,250
record that it stood for 36 years,
36 years,

2800
01:59:54,640 --> 01:59:56,030
I needed to suffer.
But,

2801
01:59:56,040 --> 01:59:58,780
but these guys and it,
and it goes back to,

2802
01:59:58,781 --> 02:00:01,090
you know,
too often it's sports science,

2803
02:00:01,091 --> 02:00:01,841
sports,
nutrition.

2804
02:00:01,841 --> 02:00:03,790
Let's look at,
look at your gait analysis,

2805
02:00:03,791 --> 02:00:04,624
running biomechanics,
what footwear are using minimally shoes 

2806
02:00:06,990 --> 02:00:07,823
on and everybody.

2807
02:00:08,590 --> 02:00:09,423
Whereas with this with fell running,
it took 36 years for somebody to get 

2808
02:00:13,991 --> 02:00:15,210
close to that record.
Just like,

2809
02:00:15,230 --> 02:00:17,230
wow,
what were they doing so far back?

2810
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:21,070
Granted you need to know the terrain.
Like you could on this descent,

2811
02:00:21,100 --> 02:00:21,933
on this picture for instance,
you could be running down their 

2812
02:00:23,051 --> 02:00:25,210
struggling down the rocks and you might 
not know that just,

2813
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:26,740
you know,
50 meters to your right,

2814
02:00:26,741 --> 02:00:30,890
there's a perfect sheep trail and that's
kind of the concept of,

2815
02:00:30,900 --> 02:00:31,930
of,
of fell running.

2816
02:00:31,970 --> 02:00:32,803
So it's just a matter of getting up and 
above and over it no matter what path 

2817
02:00:35,741 --> 02:00:36,790
you take.
Yeah,

2818
02:00:36,791 --> 02:00:37,624
yeah.
But certainly efficient if you know of 

2819
02:00:38,871 --> 02:00:39,704
something.
And so that guy in the front there is 

2820
02:00:40,301 --> 02:00:41,134
pacing him basically because it's very 
easy to get lost on the duracell know a 

2821
02:00:44,661 --> 02:00:47,920
specific path that you have to take.
They have to get over it.

2822
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:49,570
There's certain points that you have to 
get through.

2823
02:00:49,571 --> 02:00:51,940
But then in terms of the terrain and the
[inaudible] no,

2824
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:52,833
not really.
So it's just point to point to point to 

2825
02:00:54,071 --> 02:00:54,904
point.
But how do they mark those points to 

2826
02:00:56,231 --> 02:00:58,060
they have a cones and we'll,
I mean this,

2827
02:00:58,061 --> 02:01:00,640
yeah,
we'll be long established that to do the

2828
02:01:00,640 --> 02:01:01,473
Bob Graham you need to do that point,
that point and then you come back to 

2829
02:01:03,731 --> 02:01:04,870
moot hall,
you know,

2830
02:01:04,871 --> 02:01:05,704
within hopefully 24 hours and if you do 
it then you have your have your bob 

2831
02:01:09,761 --> 02:01:13,090
grounds.
These guys look like a guy that would do

2832
02:01:13,091 --> 02:01:14,350
that.
Whereas you don't,

2833
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:15,313
right.
This is my point about you and 

2834
02:01:17,081 --> 02:01:19,510
endurance,
like how your physique,

2835
02:01:19,930 --> 02:01:23,620
you don't see a guy with your physique 
doing this kind of stuff.

2836
02:01:23,700 --> 02:01:26,860
You think that you could do this kind of
stuff running.

2837
02:01:26,861 --> 02:01:27,380
I mean,
you know,

2838
02:01:27,380 --> 02:01:28,213
I always say I'm not self deprecating.
And how much do you think at the moment 

2839
02:01:32,651 --> 02:01:35,320
about a hundred kilos,
which is a lot considering our 20.

2840
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:37,300
Yeah.
So that's about 220 pounds.

2841
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:38,960
Yeah.
So I,

2842
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:40,040
yeah,
the Bob Graham is something

2843
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:40,873
complete different than that goes back 
to what we were talking about about 

2844
02:01:42,141 --> 02:01:44,470
power to weight ratio in a weight 
bearing sports.

2845
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:47,030
It was something like running,
cause you're so heavy.

2846
02:01:47,090 --> 02:01:49,130
Yeah.
You have a lot of power.

2847
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:52,220
Do you think it would be possible if you
put,

2848
02:01:52,370 --> 02:01:55,160
if you added more power to,
obviously not now because you're getting

2849
02:01:55,161 --> 02:01:59,990
off for five months on a boat,
but if you built your legs and your feet

2850
02:01:59,991 --> 02:02:01,850
back up,
do you think you could do this?

2851
02:02:02,110 --> 02:02:03,980
Yeah.
And do you think this is possibly,

2852
02:02:03,981 --> 02:02:05,090
I'm sorry,
but no way near,

2853
02:02:05,091 --> 02:02:06,020
I mean killing Jeanette.
What?

2854
02:02:06,090 --> 02:02:08,890
He's amazing.
I mean with Kilian he um,

2855
02:02:08,930 --> 02:02:12,860
I believe don't come out that he's,
he's almost sort of semi nomadic.

2856
02:02:12,861 --> 02:02:14,930
He grew up in the hills,
semi nomadic.

2857
02:02:15,130 --> 02:02:15,963
Most of for him,
he would run a marathon to go and get 

2858
02:02:18,801 --> 02:02:19,790
his,
you know,

2859
02:02:19,791 --> 02:02:20,990
carton of milk in the morning.

2860
02:02:21,110 --> 02:02:22,010
Oh Geez.
You know,

2861
02:02:22,011 --> 02:02:23,810
so when you are lining up on a start 
line,

2862
02:02:23,811 --> 02:02:24,644
I mean if you're racing at Kenyon,
you look over and you've got a guy like 

2863
02:02:27,021 --> 02:02:28,760
that.
Fuck yeah,

2864
02:02:28,761 --> 02:02:30,240
you just,
you just get a lot.

2865
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:31,280
I'm out,
I'm out.

2866
02:02:31,730 --> 02:02:33,260
You can't beat that guy.
But he's,

2867
02:02:33,470 --> 02:02:37,880
but he has built for that.
That's my like so you,

2868
02:02:37,881 --> 02:02:39,890
but you don't think that guy built for 
swimming.

2869
02:02:39,950 --> 02:02:42,740
Like if that guy had to do what you did 
swimming wise,

2870
02:02:42,770 --> 02:02:43,603
he would be at a disadvantage over a 
certain difference going back to the 

2871
02:02:46,611 --> 02:02:47,190
belt,
right.

2872
02:02:47,190 --> 02:02:48,023
Somebody like that.
And in my experience when I've raced or 

2873
02:02:50,841 --> 02:02:51,674
swum with,
you know guys who are doing in a 10 

2874
02:02:53,301 --> 02:02:53,860
kilometer,
they,

2875
02:02:53,860 --> 02:02:56,210
they will be quicker than me over 10 
kilometers.

2876
02:02:56,480 --> 02:02:57,313
But then it gets to a point when we're 
like 30 kilometers in where their 

2877
02:03:01,630 --> 02:03:02,463
biomechanics just because of muscle 
endurance that starts to break down 

2878
02:03:05,210 --> 02:03:05,930
maybe as well.

2879
02:03:05,930 --> 02:03:07,970
And this is so often overlooked 
actually,

2880
02:03:07,971 --> 02:03:10,700
but you've got to train your digestive 
system.

2881
02:03:10,701 --> 02:03:13,760
So again,
this is mainly anecdotal,

2882
02:03:13,761 --> 02:03:14,594
but you know in strength based sports,
you know a lot of guys won't think 

2883
02:03:17,991 --> 02:03:21,200
anything about putting away 15,000
calories a day,

2884
02:03:21,201 --> 02:03:22,034
which is what I was doing.
So I'm doing that while you were 

2885
02:03:23,781 --> 02:03:25,040
swimming?
Yeah.

2886
02:03:25,041 --> 02:03:26,480
15,000
yeah.

2887
02:03:26,481 --> 02:03:27,590
15,000
calories.

2888
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:29,833
A lot of it.
You were sitting down once you got 

2889
02:03:31,011 --> 02:03:32,290
inside the boat.
Yeah.

2890
02:03:32,310 --> 02:03:33,620
What were you eating?
Just the,

2891
02:03:34,010 --> 02:03:35,330
it was so intuitive.
So it was,

2892
02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:38,660
it was kind of strange because the diet 
was calorie dense so you have to make up

2893
02:03:38,661 --> 02:03:41,750
for your category and climates that day.
Also looking at nutrient dense cause you

2894
02:03:41,751 --> 02:03:44,690
got to care for your immune system but 
equally palatability.

2895
02:03:44,691 --> 02:03:47,600
So when my tongue was falling upon,
you know I needed to look at that.

2896
02:03:47,601 --> 02:03:50,270
And even seasickness you're not really 
spoke about it as well,

2897
02:03:50,271 --> 02:03:51,104
which is kind of like you need something
that hits those four points and that's 

2898
02:03:53,631 --> 02:03:54,680
15,000
calories a day.

2899
02:03:54,680 --> 02:03:55,513
So for me that was quite often just like
porridge oats in a mixed with honey 

2900
02:03:59,601 --> 02:04:02,060
mixed with almond butter.
And then even looking at,

2901
02:04:02,061 --> 02:04:03,320
oh here we go.
Yeah.

2902
02:04:03,350 --> 02:04:05,240
So this is a serious,
what's that?

2903
02:04:06,610 --> 02:04:09,020
Oh,
there might be on there somewhere.

2904
02:04:09,230 --> 02:04:11,090
Yeah.
What is that in that bowl?

2905
02:04:11,150 --> 02:04:12,860
Beans mostly.
Yeah.

2906
02:04:12,861 --> 02:04:13,694
And this is why I'm,
it just got to the point where it was 

2907
02:04:14,991 --> 02:04:17,150
like what can you just like what he's 
going to say?

2908
02:04:17,151 --> 02:04:20,390
I was just eating out of the pan.
Just trying to shove it in your face.

2909
02:04:20,391 --> 02:04:21,770
Yeah.
So like what,

2910
02:04:21,771 --> 02:04:22,820
what,
what would you eat?

2911
02:04:22,900 --> 02:04:25,190
Like what were the fool?
This is probably quite a good one.

2912
02:04:25,191 --> 02:04:25,671
Yeah,
that play.

2913
02:04:25,671 --> 02:04:26,540
So yeah,
there you go.

2914
02:04:26,541 --> 02:04:27,374
Like in terms of,
so essentially as a nutritional sort of 

2915
02:04:30,801 --> 02:04:32,090
in theory,
the framework you get,

2916
02:04:32,091 --> 02:04:32,924
what was that?
Mass.

2917
02:04:33,610 --> 02:04:35,540
Oh,
so that was to stop the jellyfish.

2918
02:04:35,630 --> 02:04:36,820
Oh Jesus.
Yeah.

2919
02:04:38,940 --> 02:04:40,350
No,
but it doesn't matter.

2920
02:04:40,351 --> 02:04:42,780
Like even the mass,
cause the giant jellyfish have Scott and

2921
02:04:42,781 --> 02:04:44,130
then there'll be a pitch on there 
somewhere.

2922
02:04:44,430 --> 02:04:48,690
They're kind of like six feet long.
So when you're swimming at night and you

2923
02:04:48,691 --> 02:04:51,150
can't see them,
the tentacles will,

2924
02:04:51,180 --> 02:04:52,770
they'll just kind of,
they'll get you.

2925
02:04:52,771 --> 02:04:54,990
And so I got like,
they go in your mouth and your ears.

2926
02:04:55,140 --> 02:04:55,973
I've got one in my ear.
I've got like what will lead by a 

2927
02:04:57,631 --> 02:04:59,900
jellyfish,
she just kind of like got me there.

2928
02:04:59,910 --> 02:05:01,860
So it's like that,
that,

2929
02:05:01,980 --> 02:05:02,630
yeah,
there's a,

2930
02:05:02,630 --> 02:05:04,830
the China find and adapt the same way 
with a mass,

2931
02:05:04,831 --> 02:05:06,390
but nutritionally,
um,

2932
02:05:06,391 --> 02:05:08,970
as well,
but also looking at as a framework,

2933
02:05:08,971 --> 02:05:11,370
you having your protein,
which is pretty stable,

2934
02:05:11,371 --> 02:05:12,121
you know,
1.7

2935
02:05:12,121 --> 02:05:14,280
grams per kg of body weight per day,
you know,

2936
02:05:14,281 --> 02:05:17,850
that kind of stays the same.
So then for the rest of the 15,000

2937
02:05:17,851 --> 02:05:18,684
calories,
you basically need to make it up with 

2938
02:05:19,861 --> 02:05:21,970
your two energy yielding macronutrients.

2939
02:05:21,990 --> 02:05:25,860
So carbs and fats.
And so for me it was very carb dependent

2940
02:05:25,861 --> 02:05:28,650
because when you are swimming for a 
giant whirlpool,

2941
02:05:28,830 --> 02:05:30,180
you can't say,
can I have some fats,

2942
02:05:30,181 --> 02:05:31,920
which the body has to go a certain 
process,

2943
02:05:31,921 --> 02:05:32,760
it's going to take longer.
No,

2944
02:05:32,761 --> 02:05:36,030
you just need fast acting carbohydrates.
But then equally,

2945
02:05:36,240 --> 02:05:37,590
um,
looking at,

2946
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:38,550
uh,
MCTs,

2947
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:42,450
so a medium chain triglycerides as well,
which are a fat,

2948
02:05:42,451 --> 02:05:44,970
so they have the calorie density of a 
fat,

2949
02:05:45,360 --> 02:05:46,193
but they're treated more like a 
carbohydrate rather than long chain 

2950
02:05:48,781 --> 02:05:49,860
triglycerides.
So,

2951
02:05:50,180 --> 02:05:51,790
um,
there was a certain amount of science.

2952
02:05:51,791 --> 02:05:53,310
There are a lot of people would say,
you know,

2953
02:05:53,320 --> 02:05:55,440
our 15,000
calories that mean pizza and everything.

2954
02:05:55,441 --> 02:05:56,274
It was like,
well,

2955
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:58,800
you know,
yes to an extent,

2956
02:05:59,160 --> 02:05:59,993
but then place too much emphasis on that
and you're not caring for your immune 

2957
02:06:02,941 --> 02:06:05,520
system as well.
So to get 15,000

2958
02:06:05,521 --> 02:06:06,211
calories,
I think,

2959
02:06:06,211 --> 02:06:07,044
yeah,
I always point out that it's using 

2960
02:06:08,191 --> 02:06:10,470
things like mcts,
which you'll find in coconut oil,

2961
02:06:10,780 --> 02:06:12,090
and certainly,
again,

2962
02:06:12,091 --> 02:06:14,580
not to get too much on the science,
but capric and caprylic acid,

2963
02:06:14,581 --> 02:06:17,310
which are converted to ATP,
Adenosine triphosphate.

2964
02:06:17,310 --> 02:06:19,050
It's a molecular energy.
The muscles,

2965
02:06:19,530 --> 02:06:23,160
when you understand how to use mcts like
that,

2966
02:06:23,820 --> 02:06:26,550
it can be quite easy to make up 15,000
calories,

2967
02:06:26,670 --> 02:06:30,750
but you try and make up 15,000
calories of vegetables and fruit,

2968
02:06:30,990 --> 02:06:31,890
right?
Yeah,

2969
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:32,933
exactly.
Especially you like have like protein 

2970
02:06:34,771 --> 02:06:35,604
and then fruit and it requires a 
different digestive enzyme and then 

2971
02:06:37,531 --> 02:06:38,364
you're going to tell me to go and swim 
for a giant whirlpool and roll on my 

2972
02:06:40,651 --> 02:06:43,550
stomach for 12 hours a day.
It's just like with seasickness,

2973
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:44,940
it's not going to happen.
Yeah.

2974
02:06:44,941 --> 02:06:45,820
You just,
you,

2975
02:06:45,821 --> 02:06:48,480
you must need a lot of regret,
really dense foods.

2976
02:06:48,530 --> 02:06:49,160
Yeah.
And,

2977
02:06:49,160 --> 02:06:51,210
and that's the thing that it goes back 
to,

2978
02:06:51,300 --> 02:06:51,871
again,
this,

2979
02:06:51,871 --> 02:06:53,730
this bell curve that I've spoke about,
but,

2980
02:06:53,731 --> 02:06:54,660
um,
you know,

2981
02:06:54,690 --> 02:06:58,170
quite often a lot of endurance athletes 
that are trained with who were amazing,

2982
02:06:58,171 --> 02:07:00,510
they're unbelievable.
They're sub three hour marathon is,

2983
02:07:00,511 --> 02:07:01,170
they're incredible.

2984
02:07:01,170 --> 02:07:01,591
You know,
they're,

2985
02:07:01,591 --> 02:07:03,840
they're the guys that will go and run 
the Bob Graham,

2986
02:07:04,140 --> 02:07:07,170
but quite often they say,
but Ross can just eat.

2987
02:07:07,230 --> 02:07:09,030
And it's just like,
yeah,

2988
02:07:09,031 --> 02:07:11,790
that's often overlooked.
You know,

2989
02:07:11,791 --> 02:07:12,611
that my body,
I,

2990
02:07:12,611 --> 02:07:13,444
you know,
I didn't have a sick day for out the 

2991
02:07:14,251 --> 02:07:16,110
whole swim.
That's what it was.

2992
02:07:16,111 --> 02:07:17,060
The attribute,
and I popped,

2993
02:07:17,100 --> 02:07:20,130
I started at 92 kilos.
Um,

2994
02:07:20,160 --> 02:07:20,761
you know,
when you,

2995
02:07:20,761 --> 02:07:23,160
when you look at the pictures from the 
start to the finish,

2996
02:07:23,161 --> 02:07:26,850
I just look like,
just like Harrier.

2997
02:07:26,940 --> 02:07:27,773
Yeah.
But just also just bulk because you are 

2998
02:07:30,661 --> 02:07:34,050
asking your body to just swim around 
Great Britain.

2999
02:07:34,051 --> 02:07:35,950
So it's not just the,
that you are,

3000
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:38,230
you don't want to be in a calorie 
deficit.

3001
02:07:38,231 --> 02:07:41,410
Can you imagine how much microtrauma the
body's going to go through?

3002
02:07:41,500 --> 02:07:44,630
So you're essentially just trying to 
nurse the body saying,

3003
02:07:44,631 --> 02:07:47,290
look and know this is horrible.
I know it's cold.

3004
02:07:47,950 --> 02:07:50,020
I know I'm asking you to swim for 12 
hours a day.

3005
02:07:50,021 --> 02:07:52,330
I know there's going to be jellyfish 
toxins.

3006
02:07:52,331 --> 02:07:53,164
I mean,
not some that off stung like in a 20 

3007
02:07:54,611 --> 02:07:56,920
times in one night in a single tied,
you know,

3008
02:07:56,921 --> 02:08:01,170
so it got to the point where I talked 
about my face or changing shape.

3009
02:08:01,210 --> 02:08:02,710
Equally,
the toxins in your body,

3010
02:08:02,711 --> 02:08:05,080
your heart would start beating faster 
and you know,

3011
02:08:05,320 --> 02:08:08,250
so there was just this idea that just 
eat just to,

3012
02:08:08,310 --> 02:08:09,760
to,
to look after the body.

3013
02:08:09,940 --> 02:08:14,890
So when it comes to nutrition and were 
you taking any supplements or you taking

3014
02:08:14,891 --> 02:08:16,930
vitamins?
Yeah,

3015
02:08:16,990 --> 02:08:17,571
lots.
And,

3016
02:08:17,571 --> 02:08:19,000
and that goes to,
like I said,

3017
02:08:19,001 --> 02:08:22,360
that calorie density,
but also to make sure that you're making

3018
02:08:22,830 --> 02:08:24,760
some new system.
Yeah.

3019
02:08:24,761 --> 02:08:25,594
Yeah.
Taking everything from super green 

3020
02:08:27,341 --> 02:08:29,490
shakes,
you need to multivitamins to,

3021
02:08:29,510 --> 02:08:30,343
to protein shakes,
just to make sure that you were 

3022
02:08:34,180 --> 02:08:35,710
supplementing that calorie density.

3023
02:08:35,710 --> 02:08:36,543
I think it's so often overlooked.
The higher turnover of like 

3024
02:08:39,250 --> 02:08:40,720
phytochemicals,
enzymes,

3025
02:08:40,721 --> 02:08:43,210
micronutrients.
What about fish oil?

3026
02:08:43,220 --> 02:08:44,950
Anything along those lines?
Mega threes.

3027
02:08:44,951 --> 02:08:46,090
Yeah.
And that's what,

3028
02:08:46,150 --> 02:08:46,983
just anything that you were thinking,
well this is even to to glutamine to a 

3029
02:08:51,071 --> 02:08:54,160
higher turnover of amino acids.
So after,

3030
02:08:54,161 --> 02:08:55,300
uh,
for instance,

3031
02:08:55,301 --> 02:08:56,134
after training as well,
you can have all the protein in the 

3032
02:08:58,391 --> 02:08:59,260
world,
but if it has a,

3033
02:08:59,261 --> 02:09:02,800
a low biological value,
so I can't,

3034
02:09:02,801 --> 02:09:04,690
I'm going to try and keep the culture.
But if you look at,

3035
02:09:04,691 --> 02:09:06,160
you know,
immediately after a workout,

3036
02:09:06,450 --> 02:09:07,720
you know,
your body's basically saying,

3037
02:09:07,721 --> 02:09:08,554
look,
we need protein to repair and regrowth 

3038
02:09:09,220 --> 02:09:11,440
protein synthesis and your muscles are 
saying please.

3039
02:09:11,740 --> 02:09:14,500
But if you don't have a high 
concentration of Leucine,

3040
02:09:14,501 --> 02:09:16,270
specifically sub branch chain amino 
acids,

3041
02:09:16,271 --> 02:09:17,104
leucine within that is what will trigger
to your motor receptors to basically 

3042
02:09:20,321 --> 02:09:21,370
repair and regrow.

3043
02:09:21,790 --> 02:09:24,400
So quite often you can have all the 
protein in the world,

3044
02:09:24,401 --> 02:09:29,260
but if it's of a low biological value of
it's not very good quality protein,

3045
02:09:29,261 --> 02:09:30,094
your body is not going to assimilate it.
So it's not about the protein that you 

3046
02:09:32,711 --> 02:09:34,480
eat,
it's about the protein you assimilate.

3047
02:09:34,810 --> 02:09:35,643
Right.
So you would take branch chain amino 

3048
02:09:36,671 --> 02:09:39,340
acids postworkout yeah,
yeah.

3049
02:09:39,341 --> 02:09:40,840
And specific.
I said Leucine,

3050
02:09:40,841 --> 02:09:45,580
just to make sure that I was kickstarted
that whole recovery process because soon

3051
02:09:45,581 --> 02:09:47,290
as you got out of the water,
after six hours,

3052
02:09:47,291 --> 02:09:49,270
there's always the temptation just I 
want to pass out,

3053
02:09:49,540 --> 02:09:50,840
I want to just go to bed,
I want,

3054
02:09:50,850 --> 02:09:51,671
you know,
and it's just like,

3055
02:09:51,671 --> 02:09:54,190
no,
you've got six hours to think.

3056
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:56,560
Because when your backend now what about
your protein?

3057
02:09:56,561 --> 02:09:57,394
What you're getting it mostly from a lot
of whey protein just because of 

3058
02:09:59,771 --> 02:10:04,420
efficiency and also as well,
you've got to think in terms of the boat

3059
02:10:04,421 --> 02:10:08,050
and stocking food that like perishable,
you know,

3060
02:10:08,051 --> 02:10:09,100
food.
So you know,

3061
02:10:09,101 --> 02:10:12,190
as as much as I love my barbecue ribs 
and everything like that,

3062
02:10:12,191 --> 02:10:15,820
that wasn't going to happen on this 
small galley that we had on the boat.

3063
02:10:15,850 --> 02:10:18,130
Right.
So you get any fresh food,

3064
02:10:18,131 --> 02:10:19,600
eggs,
anything along those lines?

3065
02:10:20,090 --> 02:10:21,770
Yeah.
When we could stop in a harbor,

3066
02:10:21,940 --> 02:10:22,930
you know,
the team would go out.

3067
02:10:22,931 --> 02:10:23,764
I'd never touched land,
but they could go and quit your 

3068
02:10:24,751 --> 02:10:27,880
provision from land and bring it back.
But ultimately,

3069
02:10:27,910 --> 02:10:28,743
yeah,
it was,

3070
02:10:28,750 --> 02:10:32,950
it was trying to find a way that was,
was sustainable as possible,

3071
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:34,160
but within the

3072
02:10:34,520 --> 02:10:36,550
parameters that we had,
you know,

3073
02:10:36,551 --> 02:10:38,030
and that,
that was what was tricky.

3074
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:38,953
What about your joints?
I would imagine repetitive stress of 

3075
02:10:43,671 --> 02:10:46,610
swimming would wreck havoc on your 
shoulders.

3076
02:10:46,700 --> 02:10:48,430
Yeah.
And that's why,

3077
02:10:48,440 --> 02:10:50,090
again,
this goes back to,

3078
02:10:50,660 --> 02:10:51,493
I suppose this goes back and I was 
trying to rich roll about this actually 

3079
02:10:53,420 --> 02:10:54,253
where um,
one she developed that sort of 

3080
02:10:57,170 --> 02:10:58,003
horsepower program,
that work capacity that was talking 

3081
02:10:59,601 --> 02:11:02,420
about before from when I ran the 
marathon pulling a car.

3082
02:11:02,450 --> 02:11:03,970
It was um,
Eh,

3083
02:11:04,040 --> 02:11:06,440
this is such a strange story,
but I then that again,

3084
02:11:06,441 --> 02:11:08,390
to raise money for that,
for the teenage cancer trust,

3085
02:11:08,720 --> 02:11:10,580
I am,
I climbed a rope,

3086
02:11:10,581 --> 02:11:11,414
but I think it was a 10 meter rope.
But I repeated the climate until I 

3087
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:16,760
climbed the height of Everest.
So it was a 8,000,

3088
02:11:16,761 --> 02:11:17,594
848 meters.
And it was that that actually taught me 

3089
02:11:20,871 --> 02:11:21,704
that movement efficiency play such an 
important role in terms of endurance 

3090
02:11:25,911 --> 02:11:27,800
because you,
you could be,

3091
02:11:27,801 --> 02:11:29,510
you could have the best muscular 
endurance,

3092
02:11:29,511 --> 02:11:30,080
the world,
cartier,

3093
02:11:30,080 --> 02:11:30,650
spiritual insurance.

3094
02:11:30,650 --> 02:11:32,510
But if you can imagine with a rope 
climb,

3095
02:11:33,050 --> 02:11:35,210
if you're solely relying on your 
muscles,

3096
02:11:35,211 --> 02:11:37,700
your arms,
like your bicep tendon is just,

3097
02:11:37,820 --> 02:11:38,653
you know,
and then you can be the fittest guy in 

3098
02:11:40,011 --> 02:11:42,230
the world.
But within that kinetic chain,

3099
02:11:42,530 --> 02:11:44,940
something's going to give like the 
weakest part.

3100
02:11:45,270 --> 02:11:47,630
Um,
so you're right from that I had the,

3101
02:11:47,680 --> 02:11:50,660
the work capacity from the marathon,
then from the rope climb,

3102
02:11:50,661 --> 02:11:53,150
I certainly understood movement 
efficiency.

3103
02:11:53,300 --> 02:11:55,590
And so sort of transferring those skills
over to,

3104
02:11:55,690 --> 02:11:56,523
to swimming.
I knew that you couldn't swim like a 

3105
02:11:58,731 --> 02:12:01,040
conventional swimmer.
Everything that had taught you,

3106
02:12:01,041 --> 02:12:01,874
especially in waves and everything.
So I ended up developing quite a weird 

3107
02:12:04,971 --> 02:12:07,090
technique.
They look really slow and comes from,

3108
02:12:07,100 --> 02:12:08,780
I also,
I almost looked to sleep,

3109
02:12:08,781 --> 02:12:09,614
but you know,
it was really rolling and that's why I 

3110
02:12:10,971 --> 02:12:13,670
asked you about swimming and even 
looking at,

3111
02:12:13,700 --> 02:12:14,380
uh,
uh,

3112
02:12:14,380 --> 02:12:15,690
Bert again to use him as that.

3113
02:12:15,690 --> 02:12:16,523
But I know he does his triathlon,
but for everything that is taught about 

3114
02:12:20,631 --> 02:12:23,420
swimming,
it's probably for someone who looks like

3115
02:12:23,421 --> 02:12:26,870
you know Michael Phelps or you know,
an amazing specimen at swimming.

3116
02:12:26,871 --> 02:12:31,871
So you're saying births fat.
It was always saying I am silly.

3117
02:12:32,900 --> 02:12:34,670
I'm saying that.
But for the record,

3118
02:12:35,240 --> 02:12:36,290
Jamie,
for the record,

3119
02:12:36,300 --> 02:12:41,300
I've heard it as a repeated diapers.
I for the record on record,

3120
02:12:44,001 --> 02:12:49,001
I think he's a specimen of a male.
I was like well listen,

3121
02:12:52,551 --> 02:12:56,150
we are photographic evidence.
That photo of him with his belly hanging

3122
02:12:56,151 --> 02:12:59,390
out,
it's the most ridiculous is after he ran

3123
02:12:59,391 --> 02:13:00,224
a marathon,
is this pre or post as sober October 

3124
02:13:01,430 --> 02:13:05,840
cause he's really lost a lot now though.
He lost 18 pounds during sober October.

3125
02:13:05,841 --> 02:13:08,390
He's the only one that lost weight.
I gained weight but there was that video

3126
02:13:08,410 --> 02:13:10,240
cause he was dancing in his bathroom 
recently,

3127
02:13:10,260 --> 02:13:10,940
wasn't it?

3128
02:13:10,940 --> 02:13:12,890
Where they look at this photo denim 
pants,

3129
02:13:13,550 --> 02:13:16,160
that's not even the worst one.
I love.

3130
02:13:16,240 --> 02:13:20,330
Why is Bert Kreischer Chrysler so fat.
That is,

3131
02:13:20,630 --> 02:13:25,570
that is a fine specimen of that.
That's the one that's one basie,

3132
02:13:25,740 --> 02:13:29,060
because he wore those for the way in is 
he got me sober October.

3133
02:13:29,061 --> 02:13:31,430
He has got a bunch of those.
He's got more than one spot.

3134
02:13:32,730 --> 02:13:34,560
That's what he wears.
I love him.

3135
02:13:34,740 --> 02:13:35,573
I love him more.
The fact that he ran a marathon with 

3136
02:13:37,711 --> 02:13:40,890
that body that's like,
yeah,

3137
02:13:40,891 --> 02:13:44,250
running Lamont's in a pinto fit neat 
doesn't get enough credit.

3138
02:13:44,251 --> 02:13:45,084
I think that's,
it doesn't get enough credit Karma and 

3139
02:13:49,500 --> 02:13:52,380
everything that you have that's not 
real.

3140
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:55,890
It's not that big that's in photoshop or
something.

3141
02:13:56,720 --> 02:13:57,553
It would be the same.
It'd be the same with you that if we 

3142
02:13:59,041 --> 02:14:01,830
were looking at your swimming technique,
there'd be certain everything that you'd

3143
02:14:01,831 --> 02:14:02,664
probably learn probably wouldn't be 
applicable to you because of how broad 

3144
02:14:04,741 --> 02:14:06,540
you are,
how things that you could actually use.

3145
02:14:06,540 --> 02:14:08,880
So I was basically really engaging the 
lats,

3146
02:14:08,890 --> 02:14:10,770
the traps,
the larger muscles of the back.

3147
02:14:10,950 --> 02:14:11,780
Going back to,
uh,

3148
02:14:11,780 --> 02:14:12,613
the,
the video with Brian Shore when he was 

3149
02:14:13,891 --> 02:14:15,650
just ripping,
yeah.

3150
02:14:16,170 --> 02:14:19,060
Was just,
or ripping out the floor and,

3151
02:14:19,110 --> 02:14:21,540
and I knew that I couldn't necessarily 
do that.

3152
02:14:21,541 --> 02:14:26,541
Looking at Delta high catch high elbows,
we're going to do high elbows for 150 70

3153
02:14:27,631 --> 02:14:28,464
days for Tava right new.
So everything that I'd learned and 

3154
02:14:32,011 --> 02:14:32,844
certainly you know,
great friends of mine who are in Liam 

3155
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:38,310
tank got 50 meter world record on a back
stroke in a carry on paying double world

3156
02:14:38,311 --> 02:14:41,250
champion 10 k.
These are amazing athletes.

3157
02:14:41,730 --> 02:14:45,030
I'm not one of them.
So you developed more efficient,

3158
02:14:45,031 --> 02:14:48,480
slower,
a style that you could continue for five

3159
02:14:48,481 --> 02:14:51,930
months and you just end up,
it's like moving meditation.

3160
02:14:51,931 --> 02:14:53,730
It just became like,
you know,

3161
02:14:53,731 --> 02:14:56,430
the limiting factor was just like I was 
just getting bored.

3162
02:14:56,430 --> 02:15:00,270
I wasn't actually breathing thinking of 
this is the thing,

3163
02:15:00,271 --> 02:15:02,850
I mean you had to,
at any given time,

3164
02:15:02,851 --> 02:15:03,684
any tied,
you had to think of something that was 

3165
02:15:05,491 --> 02:15:06,324
going to be more powerful than the 
thought of stopping or fatigue or clcs 

3166
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:10,913
like getting deeper into your skin.
And so sometimes it was real easy 

3167
02:15:14,281 --> 02:15:17,250
because you were swimming with dolphins,
minky whales.

3168
02:15:17,550 --> 02:15:20,160
I swam with a basking shark.
Did they come over to you going,

3169
02:15:20,161 --> 02:15:21,960
what the fuck is this dude doing?
Yeah.

3170
02:15:21,961 --> 02:15:23,160
Like one it was,
yeah,

3171
02:15:23,170 --> 02:15:25,010
there's a,
it was a video of the ages ago with the,

3172
02:15:25,011 --> 02:15:25,844
uh,
the main keywell and d I was filming 12 

3173
02:15:27,541 --> 02:15:30,270
hours across the Bristol channel,
so that's kind of England to Wales.

3174
02:15:30,660 --> 02:15:30,941
And,
uh,

3175
02:15:30,941 --> 02:15:31,774
this was,
this was without doubt for all the 

3176
02:15:33,181 --> 02:15:34,014
hardship that I spoke about it.
I just want to say there were some 

3177
02:15:35,581 --> 02:15:39,150
amazing moments this one particular 
moment swimming across the,

3178
02:15:39,151 --> 02:15:39,984
uh,
the Bristol Channel and all of a sudden 

3179
02:15:41,191 --> 02:15:42,024
minky well,
kind of about as big as this table 

3180
02:15:43,410 --> 02:15:44,730
breaches right next to me.

3181
02:15:44,770 --> 02:15:45,541
I was like,
Whoa,

3182
02:15:45,541 --> 02:15:46,260
like Tom's rise.
I,

3183
02:15:46,260 --> 02:15:47,580
I turned to Matt,
the captain,

3184
02:15:47,581 --> 02:15:48,414
I was like,
man,

3185
02:15:49,050 --> 02:15:50,670
am I safe?
Like what's going on?

3186
02:15:50,671 --> 02:15:51,570
Like should I get out of the war?
And he said,

3187
02:15:51,600 --> 02:15:51,761
no,
no,

3188
02:15:51,761 --> 02:15:51,991
no,
no,

3189
02:15:51,991 --> 02:15:53,130
you're absolutely fine.
And I was like,

3190
02:15:53,131 --> 02:15:54,090
okay,
cause it's a minky whales,

3191
02:15:54,290 --> 02:15:55,470
the find the friendly.
I was like,

3192
02:15:55,471 --> 02:15:56,304
okay,
fair enough.

3193
02:15:56,520 --> 02:15:59,100
So I keep swimming and then for the next
five miles,

3194
02:15:59,101 --> 02:16:01,770
the minky whales circling me,
it was breaching over the top.

3195
02:16:01,771 --> 02:16:03,870
It was coming under me and swimming like
that.

3196
02:16:04,680 --> 02:16:05,840
I turned to him and I said,
Matt,

3197
02:16:05,940 --> 02:16:07,640
what's going on?
And he said,

3198
02:16:07,670 --> 02:16:10,020
I've never seen this.
He's been sailing like 40 years.

3199
02:16:10,050 --> 02:16:11,160
He says,
I've never seen this.

3200
02:16:11,161 --> 02:16:14,100
He said,
but what I think is happening is I think

3201
02:16:14,101 --> 02:16:16,230
it's a female,
and I tried to fuck you.

3202
02:16:16,350 --> 02:16:17,430
Well,
I,

3203
02:16:18,420 --> 02:16:19,820
I said,
it's not mating season is it?

3204
02:16:19,821 --> 02:16:20,181
He was like,
no,

3205
02:16:20,181 --> 02:16:20,380
no,
no,

3206
02:16:20,380 --> 02:16:20,851
no.
It's fine.

3207
02:16:20,851 --> 02:16:21,421
It's fine.
He goes,

3208
02:16:21,421 --> 02:16:23,190
what are these hats?
Even you for later?

3209
02:16:23,930 --> 02:16:28,930
It was one for four months in the 
swatter.

3210
02:16:29,530 --> 02:16:30,210
I'm gonna fuck

3211
02:16:30,210 --> 02:16:32,770
her mating seasons probably right around
the corner.

3212
02:16:32,771 --> 02:16:34,200
She's like,
if he sticks around,

3213
02:16:38,480 --> 02:16:39,700
I know.
I always like,

3214
02:16:39,701 --> 02:16:40,534
you knew what?
That was a concern of mine that was a 

3215
02:16:42,550 --> 02:16:44,500
kitchen.
But no.

3216
02:16:44,501 --> 02:16:45,110
Matt said,
no,

3217
02:16:45,110 --> 02:16:45,370
no,
no.

3218
02:16:45,370 --> 02:16:46,203
I think it's a few more.
I think that she thinks that you're an 

3219
02:16:48,281 --> 02:16:49,114
injured seal five miles.
She basically guided me all the way to 

3220
02:16:53,831 --> 02:16:58,480
the shallow water and as I got there,
it was literally the depth of the water.

3221
02:16:58,481 --> 02:16:59,310
Matt said,
Yep.

3222
02:16:59,310 --> 02:17:01,160
Yet much shallower water.
And we turned,

3223
02:17:01,300 --> 02:17:04,960
we were breached one more time and then,
and then swim off as if to say,

3224
02:17:04,961 --> 02:17:05,860
you know,
you're safe now.

3225
02:17:05,890 --> 02:17:08,110
Wow.
Amazing.

3226
02:17:08,320 --> 02:17:10,210
That's incredible.
Amazing.

3227
02:17:10,240 --> 02:17:11,073
Yeah.
So for all of the hardship and 

3228
02:17:12,281 --> 02:17:14,960
everything that I described,
there were moments and sunsets and,

3229
02:17:14,961 --> 02:17:18,730
and swimming with seals and,
and it was amazing.

3230
02:17:18,840 --> 02:17:20,980
And also that's the basking shark.

3231
02:17:21,220 --> 02:17:23,120
Is that what you encountered?
Yes.

3232
02:17:23,121 --> 02:17:25,660
So that was in the actual one you 
encountered?

3233
02:17:25,750 --> 02:17:27,720
I don't know if I can't,
I mean also in behind,

3234
02:17:27,860 --> 02:17:29,800
you could swim in that.
I was,

3235
02:17:30,550 --> 02:17:32,440
I was concerned about that one,
but they didn't know.

3236
02:17:32,441 --> 02:17:34,000
So that's a basking shark.
So they're friendly.

3237
02:17:34,030 --> 02:17:35,770
But the Mac,
can you imagine seeing that?

3238
02:17:35,771 --> 02:17:38,200
Like assuming free Scotland,
not mountains,

3239
02:17:38,250 --> 02:17:39,460
either side of you.
And so,

3240
02:17:39,670 --> 02:17:42,490
so to your point about asking what you 
think about,

3241
02:17:43,120 --> 02:17:43,953
it's very easy to swim when,
when you know this dolphins and 

3242
02:17:46,511 --> 02:17:47,344
everything,
but there's times when you are lost in 

3243
02:17:49,151 --> 02:17:52,750
this moving meditation.
But then you see something like that and

3244
02:17:52,751 --> 02:17:54,910
you very quickly got to get your wits 
about you.

3245
02:17:55,610 --> 02:17:57,550
Cause,
cause they were killer whales as well,

3246
02:17:57,570 --> 02:17:58,121
up,
uh,

3247
02:17:58,121 --> 02:17:58,954
you know,
coming from sort of Iceland around the 

3248
02:17:59,591 --> 02:18:01,570
top of Scotland.
So that was,

3249
02:18:01,571 --> 02:18:02,470
that was a concern.

3250
02:18:02,500 --> 02:18:05,890
Were they interested in you?
Thankfully we didn't see any,

3251
02:18:06,040 --> 02:18:07,740
but they wouldn't attack you or 
anything.

3252
02:18:07,840 --> 02:18:08,680
Well,
so this is it.

3253
02:18:08,681 --> 02:18:11,140
So we were speaking with marine 
biologists at the time saying,

3254
02:18:11,141 --> 02:18:13,390
look like what's,
what's the situation here?

3255
02:18:13,690 --> 02:18:14,590
And they said,
well,

3256
02:18:14,770 --> 02:18:16,270
you know what's really interesting 
there?

3257
02:18:16,290 --> 02:18:17,710
So intelligent.
You know,

3258
02:18:17,720 --> 02:18:22,240
killer whales are so intelligent and 
they've never been known.

3259
02:18:22,390 --> 02:18:23,223
This was what they said to me.
They've never been known in the wild to 

3260
02:18:25,901 --> 02:18:27,190
attack a human.
And I said,

3261
02:18:27,220 --> 02:18:28,180
okay,
fantastic.

3262
02:18:28,240 --> 02:18:29,350
And they said,
however,

3263
02:18:29,860 --> 02:18:30,693
if they're going to attack a human is 
probably going to be you because no 

3264
02:18:32,471 --> 02:18:35,530
one's ever spent that amount of time in 
the water as well,

3265
02:18:35,860 --> 02:18:36,820
you know?
So I was like,

3266
02:18:36,821 --> 02:18:37,361
right.
They said,

3267
02:18:37,361 --> 02:18:40,320
all you need to do,
all right,

3268
02:18:40,390 --> 02:18:42,430
company.
So they just said,

3269
02:18:42,431 --> 02:18:45,430
look,
all you need to do is make sure that you

3270
02:18:45,670 --> 02:18:46,690
don't look like a seal.

3271
02:18:46,690 --> 02:18:48,910
Cause they might mistake you for a seal,
but they might bite you.

3272
02:18:49,300 --> 02:18:50,560
But then they will go,
oh Whoa,

3273
02:18:50,590 --> 02:18:51,550
did that,
that intelligent.

3274
02:18:51,551 --> 02:18:51,930
They'd be like,
oh,

3275
02:18:51,930 --> 02:18:54,370
that doesn't taste like a seal.
So they might,

3276
02:18:54,371 --> 02:18:56,650
you know.
So I was just trying my best not to look

3277
02:18:56,651 --> 02:18:57,484
like a seal.
I think when they have attack people in 

3278
02:18:59,021 --> 02:19:02,980
the wild or toys or in captivity,
it's always been trainers.

3279
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:04,600
Yeah.
So it's been an anger,

3280
02:19:04,660 --> 02:19:06,150
frustration.
Yeah.

3281
02:19:06,610 --> 02:19:07,443
You know,
and that was my experience with the 

3282
02:19:08,830 --> 02:19:09,970
Minkwon,
everything it was,

3283
02:19:10,210 --> 02:19:11,740
people said like,
how'd you swim at night?

3284
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:14,290
Because certainly around a west of 
Scotland there was,

3285
02:19:14,320 --> 02:19:17,050
it was a debt for 200 meters.
So you just,

3286
02:19:17,170 --> 02:19:18,910
you can't,
you don't know what's under you.

3287
02:19:21,090 --> 02:19:21,923
So,
um,

3288
02:19:22,480 --> 02:19:23,313
there was that element but,
but I think having swum with the minky 

3289
02:19:26,571 --> 02:19:27,404
well around the Bristol Channel,
I was very aware that in the hierarchy 

3290
02:19:30,681 --> 02:19:31,514
of the sea,
I was very low down the pecking order 

3291
02:19:33,750 --> 02:19:34,210
and,
and,

3292
02:19:34,210 --> 02:19:36,350
and if it's comforting in any strange 
way,

3293
02:19:36,351 --> 02:19:36,891
I was like,
look,

3294
02:19:36,891 --> 02:19:39,170
if I was going to be eaten,
I'll be eaten in the day just as much as

3295
02:19:39,171 --> 02:19:40,560
I'll be eaten at night.
You know,

3296
02:19:40,970 --> 02:19:43,070
it's just,
it's just one of those things darkness.

3297
02:19:43,310 --> 02:19:44,061
Yeah.
Yeah.

3298
02:19:44,061 --> 02:19:44,894
Just like you can't,
you can't see the hand in front of your 

3299
02:19:46,131 --> 02:19:49,040
face.
It's like the Maury first for instance,

3300
02:19:49,041 --> 02:19:49,874
we will a 40 Mars away from land and 
this kind of cutting across this huge 

3301
02:19:54,111 --> 02:19:57,010
bay across the top of Scotland.
And um,

3302
02:19:57,550 --> 02:19:58,383
it was clouded over so there was not a,
you can even see anything cause there 

3303
02:20:00,591 --> 02:20:01,424
was no moonlight or no stars and it was 
a you in that complete sensory 

3304
02:20:06,351 --> 02:20:07,370
deprivation.

3305
02:20:07,730 --> 02:20:11,870
You can hear everything and it's just,
if you hear a noise,

3306
02:20:11,871 --> 02:20:12,860
a reporter,
you're like,

3307
02:20:12,861 --> 02:20:13,694
I really hope that's not a killer whale.
But then you've then got six hours to 

3308
02:20:16,941 --> 02:20:19,070
contemplate whether it,
so it's this,

3309
02:20:19,071 --> 02:20:20,330
and again,
like I said,

3310
02:20:20,331 --> 02:20:21,800
Marcus Aurelius,
meditations,

3311
02:20:21,801 --> 02:20:22,634
stoic philosophy that the conversations 
you have in your own head are just as 

3312
02:20:25,341 --> 02:20:26,174
powerful with other people.
And I certainly found that all the way 

3313
02:20:28,161 --> 02:20:29,750
around that you just,
um,

3314
02:20:30,280 --> 02:20:32,210
there was times when you were just like,
what am I doing out here?

3315
02:20:32,260 --> 02:20:33,680
I'm like,
seriously?

3316
02:20:34,130 --> 02:20:37,220
And that comes from,
I think,

3317
02:20:37,310 --> 02:20:38,091
you know,
this,

3318
02:20:38,091 --> 02:20:41,330
this idea of you have to be doing it for
the right reasons.

3319
02:20:41,500 --> 02:20:43,100
And,
and I've I again to,

3320
02:20:43,110 --> 02:20:45,920
to bring it back to mma,
I suppose it's really fascinated me.

3321
02:20:45,921 --> 02:20:48,110
You know,
some fighters in a ladelle coming out of

3322
02:20:48,111 --> 02:20:50,060
retirement,
we all tease and certainly,

3323
02:20:50,061 --> 02:20:50,910
you know,
you know,

3324
02:20:50,960 --> 02:20:52,820
Mcgregor is made so much money,
you know,

3325
02:20:52,821 --> 02:20:53,654
what would get him back out of 
retirement to come and fight mayweather 

3326
02:20:56,091 --> 02:20:56,930
and,
and you know,

3327
02:20:56,931 --> 02:20:57,764
again,
I've been out at sea so I didn't quite 

3328
02:20:58,641 --> 02:21:00,500
understand what was going on there with 
the,

3329
02:21:00,680 --> 02:21:03,380
his kind of going over to as a Japan 
fighting.

3330
02:21:03,380 --> 02:21:04,880
And it's like,
what does he need?

3331
02:21:04,881 --> 02:21:05,870
He's got so much money.
Yeah.

3332
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:09,160
What would warrant a,
whether they were the spends money,

3333
02:21:09,650 --> 02:21:13,330
spends money like crazy.
He was gonna fight tension,

3334
02:21:13,810 --> 02:21:14,643
tension.
How do you pronounce his last name 

3335
02:21:16,021 --> 02:21:17,340
correctly?
Not Sue Cowell.

3336
02:21:17,360 --> 02:21:18,260
No.
So I've been at a seat,

3337
02:21:18,261 --> 02:21:19,690
so I didn't really see what was going on
here.

3338
02:21:20,050 --> 02:21:20,883
Yeah.
Let me see if you find that on my 

3339
02:21:22,391 --> 02:21:24,190
instagram.
He's out of his fucking mind.

3340
02:21:24,310 --> 02:21:26,210
Would that have been a bad idea?
Horrible.

3341
02:21:26,230 --> 02:21:29,240
He would get head kicked into a coma.
But you,

3342
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:30,740
but you kind of ask like what?
What,

3343
02:21:30,741 --> 02:21:31,990
what are the reasons?
And I think,

3344
02:21:31,991 --> 02:21:34,690
okay,
I think he spends a shit ton of money.

3345
02:21:35,350 --> 02:21:38,020
You think they're trying to get it back 
on track?

3346
02:21:38,400 --> 02:21:41,920
I said floyd had been duped into 
agreeing to the contest.

3347
02:21:42,180 --> 02:21:43,390
Look,
they will do him.

3348
02:21:43,450 --> 02:21:46,390
By the way,
they are very different if those,

3349
02:21:46,570 --> 02:21:49,120
if this happens,
believe you me,

3350
02:21:49,510 --> 02:21:52,010
he's going to get kicked in the head.
They're going to,

3351
02:21:52,330 --> 02:21:53,560
they might say,
no,

3352
02:21:53,561 --> 02:21:55,180
no Kiki,
no Kiki,

3353
02:21:55,600 --> 02:21:58,120
listen man,
you get in the ring with tension.

3354
02:21:58,490 --> 02:22:02,560
He's going to try to roundhouse kick you
into another fucking dimension.

3355
02:22:02,710 --> 02:22:04,080
So it was,
it was a special bounce.

3356
02:22:04,081 --> 02:22:04,914
So there's gonna be no kicking.
I don't know if they agreed to the 

3357
02:22:07,601 --> 02:22:09,040
rules.
Wow.

3358
02:22:09,100 --> 02:22:12,010
Okay.
But tension not Sukarno was,

3359
02:22:12,190 --> 02:22:15,700
I think he's 20,
I think he's 20 years old.

3360
02:22:16,090 --> 02:22:20,020
He's a really fantastic talent.
Wow.

3361
02:22:20,140 --> 02:22:20,951
Yeah.
I mean,

3362
02:22:20,951 --> 02:22:21,880
he really is,

3363
02:22:22,250 --> 02:22:23,390
but it,
but it fascinates me.

3364
02:22:23,391 --> 02:22:25,140
So I'm catching up on all this.
Like I said,

3365
02:22:25,141 --> 02:22:25,980
so I've,
I've missed

3366
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:27,670
all of this for 157.
They'd look sad.

3367
02:22:27,710 --> 02:22:30,030
I even missed the mcgregor and 
[inaudible] and stuff.

3368
02:22:30,031 --> 02:22:33,420
Go do a striking breakdowns on 
instagram.

3369
02:22:33,421 --> 02:22:34,254
Lawrence tension has a,
he's done a bunch of breakdowns as is 

3370
02:22:37,351 --> 02:22:40,590
Brendan Dorm has done a bunch of 
breakdowns to on tension,

3371
02:22:40,980 --> 02:22:41,813
but,
uh,

3372
02:22:42,150 --> 02:22:42,983
he's,
Lawrence Kenshin has this really 

3373
02:22:44,431 --> 02:22:48,960
fascinating video of him fighting this 
world Moitai champion.

3374
02:22:49,170 --> 02:22:51,600
And uh,
he wheel kicks him in the head,

3375
02:22:51,630 --> 02:22:54,780
was more like a jump,
spinning back kick to the chin.

3376
02:22:54,781 --> 02:22:57,960
But the way he did it,
it was like a really weird angle and you

3377
02:22:57,961 --> 02:22:58,794
could see them setting it up.
He's really creative and he just found 

3378
02:23:01,591 --> 02:23:06,591
like a weird opening a for this guy and 
just kick this guy into oblivion.

3379
02:23:07,980 --> 02:23:08,820
Right.
He's,

3380
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,670
he's nasty.
And he's really sneaky,

3381
02:23:11,850 --> 02:23:13,680
like the kind of techniques that he 
lands.

3382
02:23:13,681 --> 02:23:14,514
It's very clever with his reads and his 
understanding of distance and in what's 

3383
02:23:18,301 --> 02:23:19,290
possible.
Right.

3384
02:23:19,291 --> 02:23:21,780
Do you see it striking breakdowns on,
on instagram?

3385
02:23:22,480 --> 02:23:24,380
Might not be the name of it.
Huh?

3386
02:23:25,280 --> 02:23:26,460
But yeah,
it's with this,

3387
02:23:28,450 --> 02:23:29,900
you know,
how much money does he need?

3388
02:23:29,901 --> 02:23:32,690
He can call on spend that much.
That's a good question.

3389
02:23:32,720 --> 02:23:35,870
I think he can,
but,

3390
02:23:35,871 --> 02:23:37,340
and this is what I love.
Again,

3391
02:23:37,341 --> 02:23:39,200
I'm only just catching up on this,
like set out you,

3392
02:23:39,201 --> 02:23:41,360
I should point out I have been at sea 
for 157 days,

3393
02:23:41,361 --> 02:23:43,990
but with everything that happened was 
treating breakdowns.

3394
02:23:44,270 --> 02:23:44,870
No,
on that.

3395
02:23:44,870 --> 02:23:47,180
I just got to it.
Striking breakdowns.

3396
02:23:50,380 --> 02:23:52,330
Good.
What?

3397
02:23:52,350 --> 02:23:53,200
I typed it,
man.

3398
02:23:54,380 --> 02:23:55,330
Start coming out.
Nope.

3399
02:23:56,990 --> 02:23:59,300
Maybe there's something wrong with 
instagram.

3400
02:24:02,520 --> 02:24:04,170
Hmm.
I Dunno.

3401
02:24:04,240 --> 02:24:05,260
I got it right here.
Here.

3402
02:24:05,261 --> 02:24:06,550
I'll send you the link.
Okay,

3403
02:24:06,610 --> 02:24:08,080
so we could see a,

3404
02:24:10,360 --> 02:24:11,320
yeah,
here we go.

3405
02:24:11,321 --> 02:24:16,321
I'll send you this.
They're toppy link.

3406
02:24:18,760 --> 02:24:19,720
Sorry folks.

3407
02:24:20,310 --> 02:24:23,790
But this is a,
I don't know how much they were offering

3408
02:24:23,791 --> 02:24:24,690
him,
you know,

3409
02:24:24,691 --> 02:24:27,810
so I don't know how much I'm okay.
I just sent it to you.

3410
02:24:28,590 --> 02:24:31,530
I don't know.
I mean it has to be millions of dollars.

3411
02:24:31,740 --> 02:24:33,300
That's the only way he'd be willing to 
do it.

3412
02:24:33,990 --> 02:24:35,460
But if they offer,
and he also,

3413
02:24:35,461 --> 02:24:40,461
tension is quite a bit smaller.
I think he weighs one 30 and floyd walks

3414
02:24:41,101 --> 02:24:41,934
around,
I mean he's fought at one 54 one 50 ish 

3415
02:24:44,860 --> 02:24:49,860
and mcgregor was at 55 mm is this,
this kid is fucking nasty man.

3416
02:24:50,880 --> 02:24:54,750
But he does a lot of wild shit.
Like there's a,

3417
02:24:54,810 --> 02:24:59,220
there's a video here or the see him 
fight this Moy Thai guy and he hits them

3418
02:24:59,280 --> 02:25:02,940
with this crazy.
That's when he was a little kid.

3419
02:25:03,710 --> 02:25:07,790
Like see how he does shit like that.
Like sneaky shit under the sip,

3420
02:25:07,810 --> 02:25:10,200
sip and it,
he was young.

3421
02:25:10,200 --> 02:25:12,450
He was this,
we got this crank.

3422
02:25:12,660 --> 02:25:15,150
Oh this is the one with the World Moy 
Thai champion.

3423
02:25:15,330 --> 02:25:16,163
Boom.
Puts that due to sleep but the way set 

3424
02:25:19,891 --> 02:25:22,950
it up.
That's a weird angle for that kick.

3425
02:25:23,110 --> 02:25:24,370
Very tight.
Yeah,

3426
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:26,950
very tight clothes.
And it wasn't around.

3427
02:25:26,951 --> 02:25:30,250
It was straight.
So it was basically like a jump,

3428
02:25:30,251 --> 02:25:33,510
spinning back kick to the chin,
which is hard to generate force.

3429
02:25:33,590 --> 02:25:34,660
Oh No,
no,

3430
02:25:34,661 --> 02:25:35,111
no,
no,

3431
02:25:35,111 --> 02:25:36,880
no.
This power.

3432
02:25:37,330 --> 02:25:38,170
Yeah.
No,

3433
02:25:38,171 --> 02:25:40,810
as long as he can get extension on his 
legs,

3434
02:25:40,830 --> 02:25:43,750
it's just he had to jump and talk and 
spin.

3435
02:25:43,930 --> 02:25:44,763
But the fact that he chose that angle,
it's like he realized that the guy was 

3436
02:25:48,011 --> 02:25:49,870
going to see things that were coming 
around.

3437
02:25:50,320 --> 02:25:53,710
So instead of coming around,
he had it come up and,

3438
02:25:53,711 --> 02:25:55,690
and through the middle,
which is,

3439
02:25:55,691 --> 02:25:58,750
which made it much sneakier but that's 
it.

3440
02:25:58,940 --> 02:26:01,640
What we're describing now is it never 
intangible,

3441
02:26:01,641 --> 02:26:03,140
right.
Creativity.

3442
02:26:03,320 --> 02:26:04,550
Yeah,
exactly.

3443
02:26:04,551 --> 02:26:05,100
I mean,
I,

3444
02:26:05,100 --> 02:26:05,933
I'm what I find it so interesting when,
you know Mcgregor Diaz and I was just 

3445
02:26:11,091 --> 02:26:12,680
say I'm a huge fan of Ido,
poor towel.

3446
02:26:12,681 --> 02:26:15,100
So when they use their own,
but I was just like,

3447
02:26:15,101 --> 02:26:16,100
look,
and I think it was,

3448
02:26:16,101 --> 02:26:17,930
um,
I think mcgregor was on,

3449
02:26:18,480 --> 02:26:20,180
I want to say Kimmel,
but I don't think it was,

3450
02:26:20,181 --> 02:26:23,530
he was on a chat show and he was talking
about that spinning cap aware,

3451
02:26:23,570 --> 02:26:25,700
a crescent kick.
And he actually did it.

3452
02:26:25,701 --> 02:26:26,810
He performed it.
And I was like,

3453
02:26:26,811 --> 02:26:28,040
look,
if he lands that,

3454
02:26:28,180 --> 02:26:30,080
you know,
the same way with Aldo,

3455
02:26:30,350 --> 02:26:33,340
it's be like that is the movement is it,
you know,

3456
02:26:33,341 --> 02:26:35,750
you can forget cardiorespiratory 
endurance,

3457
02:26:35,751 --> 02:26:37,460
strength,
everything that we talked about that the

3458
02:26:37,461 --> 02:26:38,800
metric saying,
you know,

3459
02:26:38,810 --> 02:26:39,850
heavy where you gotta be two,
four,

3460
02:26:39,860 --> 02:26:40,491
five,
you know,

3461
02:26:40,491 --> 02:26:41,350
whatever.
No,

3462
02:26:41,410 --> 02:26:42,243
it's just movement.
He would have reinvented and again more 

3463
02:26:45,010 --> 02:26:47,770
and I could be wrong.
I think we do yet he did try it,

3464
02:26:47,780 --> 02:26:49,700
didn't it?
And it missed I think,

3465
02:26:50,750 --> 02:26:52,700
I believe he did look through it through
it.

3466
02:26:52,730 --> 02:26:54,260
I think he threw it.
The thing,

3467
02:26:54,350 --> 02:26:56,990
you know,
that technique is a legit technique.

3468
02:26:56,991 --> 02:26:59,600
Obviously we'll kicks most certainly 
work,

3469
02:27:00,110 --> 02:27:03,470
but it's not a high percentage technique
doesn't,

3470
02:27:03,860 --> 02:27:07,430
there's only been a few.
We'll kick knockouts in in the UFC.

3471
02:27:07,610 --> 02:27:09,800
The first one was Edson Barboza over 
Terry.

3472
02:27:09,801 --> 02:27:10,940
Adam.
That was number one.

3473
02:27:11,360 --> 02:27:13,290
There's been a few since then.
Uh,

3474
02:27:13,340 --> 02:27:16,460
Vitor Belfort shocked Luke rockhold with
the wheel kick.

3475
02:27:16,461 --> 02:27:17,750
It's,
it's happened before.

3476
02:27:17,770 --> 02:27:18,440
Right?
Um,

3477
02:27:18,440 --> 02:27:21,740
but it's just not a high percentage kick
and it's usually a kick that's,

3478
02:27:22,340 --> 02:27:23,173
you know,
it's

3479
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:24,960
nowhere.
You don't expect it.

3480
02:27:25,050 --> 02:27:26,210
Right.
But that's a bit,

3481
02:27:26,250 --> 02:27:30,240
but can you tell when someone has it and
doesn't cause it's an intangible.

3482
02:27:30,241 --> 02:27:34,950
So if you said if it there started the 
Barboza and atom fight,

3483
02:27:34,951 --> 02:27:36,420
you said,
you know,

3484
02:27:36,421 --> 02:27:40,710
knock out by timing or creativity you'd 
st like why would you mean?

3485
02:27:40,711 --> 02:27:41,544
You know,
but if you could foresee that the same 

3486
02:27:43,021 --> 02:27:46,620
way that you could quantify that sort of
mental fortitude.

3487
02:27:46,650 --> 02:27:50,360
I think you start opening the door in 
sports performance into something that's

3488
02:27:50,370 --> 02:27:54,300
just this whole other realm that you 
don't talk about weight as a metric.

3489
02:27:54,301 --> 02:27:56,390
Strength,
cardiorespiratory endurance.

3490
02:27:56,391 --> 02:27:59,120
You can start talking you.
Is that hard to see again?

3491
02:27:59,380 --> 02:28:01,470
Take well yeah,
with creativity,

3492
02:28:01,471 --> 02:28:03,540
especially in regards to striking 
technique.

3493
02:28:03,541 --> 02:28:04,220
Yeah,
that's,

3494
02:28:04,220 --> 02:28:05,053
that's a crazy intangible because you're
essentially deciding when to move and 

3495
02:28:09,321 --> 02:28:10,490
what to do,
right?

3496
02:28:10,520 --> 02:28:13,160
Like you can throw a jab,
you throw a front kick,

3497
02:28:13,310 --> 02:28:14,143
you could throw a roundhouse kick,
you could throw a wheel kick and you 

3498
02:28:15,741 --> 02:28:16,574
throw a turning side kick.
You could throw an ax kick if you're 

3499
02:28:18,321 --> 02:28:18,981
crazy,
you know,

3500
02:28:18,981 --> 02:28:20,660
and this is a lot of different things 
you can do.

3501
02:28:20,840 --> 02:28:23,300
So do you decide to do and why do you 
say to do it?

3502
02:28:23,410 --> 02:28:24,243
Is it because you have a style like some
people style is like conor likes to hop 

3503
02:28:27,921 --> 02:28:30,260
in and out and he throws like a little 
front leg sidekick.

3504
02:28:30,500 --> 02:28:33,230
He throws like that for movement.
He likes to keep his arms wide.

3505
02:28:33,231 --> 02:28:34,064
It makes his tennis sideways stance.
Some guys like to hold up like this and 

3506
02:28:37,421 --> 02:28:38,254
the Moitai Shell and they move forward 
lifting the front leg up and they move 

3507
02:28:41,391 --> 02:28:42,224
forward and,
and challenge with leg kicks and 

3508
02:28:43,731 --> 02:28:44,570
striking technique.

3509
02:28:44,720 --> 02:28:46,530
Some guys just like to wrestle.
They,

3510
02:28:46,540 --> 02:28:47,373
they'll,
they'll pour at you and they look to 

3511
02:28:48,441 --> 02:28:50,140
shoot like Ben Aspirin,
you know,

3512
02:28:50,150 --> 02:28:52,040
he's not looking to stand up and strike 
with anybody.

3513
02:28:52,041 --> 02:28:53,960
He's looking at taking the ground beat 
the fuck out of you.

3514
02:28:54,320 --> 02:28:55,670
That's what he does.
So it's all,

3515
02:28:55,671 --> 02:28:56,504
and what do you decide to do and why do 
you decide to do it and when do you 

3516
02:29:00,591 --> 02:29:02,780
decide to do it?
When do you engage?

3517
02:29:03,020 --> 02:29:04,940
You know you're throwing some faints,
you know,

3518
02:29:04,941 --> 02:29:08,060
you don't want to be the guy who makes 
it obvious that you moving forward.

3519
02:29:08,270 --> 02:29:11,300
Cause then like connor clipped Aldo,
you get rocked.

3520
02:29:12,060 --> 02:29:13,570
You know it's a,
it's a crazy,

3521
02:29:13,640 --> 02:29:15,460
crazy sport is,
but you,

3522
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:19,470
if you enter into that realm and even 
start applying more sweats again,

3523
02:29:19,490 --> 02:29:21,680
we talked about that sort of strength 
deficit as well.

3524
02:29:21,681 --> 02:29:23,330
That if you get someone um,
you know,

3525
02:29:23,350 --> 02:29:24,830
trying to like,
like John Jones who,

3526
02:29:24,831 --> 02:29:25,820
you know,
move up to heavyweight,

3527
02:29:25,821 --> 02:29:26,654
is it going to be,
will it benefit him winning with 

3528
02:29:28,020 --> 02:29:30,860
strength training for instance,
I can't remember.

3529
02:29:30,860 --> 02:29:32,240
He's dead lift,
but it's pretty impressive.

3530
02:29:32,241 --> 02:29:33,980
It's an impressive,
I think it was 600 pounds.

3531
02:29:34,010 --> 02:29:35,030
Big Dead Lift.
Yeah.

3532
02:29:35,031 --> 02:29:36,920
So when you look at that strength 
deficit,

3533
02:29:36,921 --> 02:29:38,030
Jon Jones,
very lean,

3534
02:29:38,031 --> 02:29:41,060
was using neuro muscular.
He was recruiting voluntarily,

3535
02:29:41,061 --> 02:29:43,040
all of those muscle fibers.
It was unbelievable.

3536
02:29:43,190 --> 02:29:44,990
But if it means that to it,
it would it be,

3537
02:29:45,230 --> 02:29:47,480
would any more muscle mass be 
functional?

3538
02:29:47,660 --> 02:29:51,140
And I think when you start the question 
looking at when should he do that?

3539
02:29:51,141 --> 02:29:54,020
That's another good question because 
you're beating your body up to do that.

3540
02:29:54,080 --> 02:29:54,913
Yeah.
And is that conducive with a high 

3541
02:29:58,550 --> 02:30:03,400
aerobic capacity training,
like multiple rounds of sparring and bag

3542
02:30:03,401 --> 02:30:04,234
work and pad work,
and you're all the lower back muscles 

3543
02:30:07,791 --> 02:30:08,624
that are getting stressed.
And does that lead to potential 

3544
02:30:10,731 --> 02:30:14,390
injuries?
Is the potentially damaging his discs,

3545
02:30:14,720 --> 02:30:17,150
his knees,
like there's a lot of a lot of things to

3546
02:30:17,151 --> 02:30:17,690
be considered.

3547
02:30:17,690 --> 02:30:18,523
And when should you do that?
A lot of people that you think you 

3548
02:30:19,821 --> 02:30:21,730
should do that when you're nowhere near 
camp.

3549
02:30:21,760 --> 02:30:22,460
Yeah.
Yeah.

3550
02:30:22,460 --> 02:30:24,840
Like you win a fight and then you decide
to,

3551
02:30:24,860 --> 02:30:27,210
to build up in between camps.
Yeah.

3552
02:30:27,380 --> 02:30:29,770
And I think that's so awful.
Even a Darren till,

3553
02:30:29,850 --> 02:30:31,550
you know,
who is a huge,

3554
02:30:31,551 --> 02:30:33,620
huge,
huge currently,

3555
02:30:33,621 --> 02:30:35,270
but he's moving to middleweight and now,
yes.

3556
02:30:35,330 --> 02:30:36,163
Yeah.
He's missed weight and his title shot 

3557
02:30:37,491 --> 02:30:41,390
against Tyron Woodley and then he got 
rocked put away.

3558
02:30:41,450 --> 02:30:43,670
So if you're moving up,
how do you do it?

3559
02:30:43,671 --> 02:30:45,570
Do you do it intelligently?
Do you?

3560
02:30:45,571 --> 02:30:46,404
Yeah.
But then there are guys who were just 

3561
02:30:48,200 --> 02:30:49,033
like,
they say training is the real 

3562
02:30:50,580 --> 02:30:54,140
realization of one's genetic potential.
And when you get someone like,

3563
02:30:54,240 --> 02:30:55,880
you know,
rumble Johnson,

3564
02:30:55,881 --> 02:30:56,960
it's just,
you know,

3565
02:30:56,980 --> 02:30:59,540
now you never met.
He fought well tomorrow he made,

3566
02:30:59,541 --> 02:31:00,111
wait,
I'm sorry.

3567
02:31:00,111 --> 02:31:02,630
He made weight against Tyron Woodley,
didn't he?

3568
02:31:03,830 --> 02:31:05,560
Yes.
He made waves with it.

3569
02:31:05,561 --> 02:31:07,900
He didn't make weight against Donald 
terrone.

3570
02:31:08,180 --> 02:31:09,200
Right.
That's what it was.

3571
02:31:09,230 --> 02:31:11,360
He came in very heavy and sounds around 
him.

3572
02:31:11,640 --> 02:31:13,670
He's a big motherfuckers.
What he is,

3573
02:31:13,720 --> 02:31:15,920
you know what I mean?
He's so big for welterweight.

3574
02:31:16,220 --> 02:31:18,860
I think you'll be way better off at 185 
pounds.

3575
02:31:18,861 --> 02:31:20,040
But I think many of them will.

3576
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:20,873
I think there's a point of diminishing 
returns where they are significantly 

3577
02:31:23,521 --> 02:31:26,070
depleting themselves to make that 
weight.

3578
02:31:26,071 --> 02:31:27,480
And then when they don't have to do 
that,

3579
02:31:27,481 --> 02:31:30,030
they have more energy.
And we've seen that time and time again.

3580
02:31:30,090 --> 02:31:32,040
Exactly.
But when you did rumble Johnson,

3581
02:31:32,041 --> 02:31:33,120
he fought at welter weight.
Right?

3582
02:31:34,430 --> 02:31:38,670
He's so big like gone and then all of a 
sudden mood a mood and then,

3583
02:31:38,900 --> 02:31:39,301
you know,
it was,

3584
02:31:39,301 --> 02:31:40,860
it no guerra.
I mean nowhere.

3585
02:31:40,970 --> 02:31:41,910
Yeah.
Oh my God.

3586
02:31:41,911 --> 02:31:43,500
When he just bounced the fight.
Heavyweight,

3587
02:31:43,501 --> 02:31:45,900
he did fight heavyweight successfully 
in,

3588
02:31:45,901 --> 02:31:48,600
in um,
the Pfl he not,

3589
02:31:48,601 --> 02:31:49,434
he broke Andrea Orlowski his jaw.
He fucked Andrea Lawsky up as a 

3590
02:31:52,621 --> 02:31:53,980
heavyweight.
Right.

3591
02:31:54,180 --> 02:31:55,840
And that's what always fascinates me is 
that,

3592
02:31:55,841 --> 02:32:00,841
and I suppose when I see this,
that God given kind of power yeah.

3593
02:32:01,860 --> 02:32:05,280
For all of the training it seems,
and it was someone like,

3594
02:32:05,790 --> 02:32:07,220
yeah.
Johnson and he,

3595
02:32:07,230 --> 02:32:08,063
cause he said,
am I right thinking he said he's going 

3596
02:32:09,121 --> 02:32:11,550
to come back for heavyweight if DC and 
Jones go up.

3597
02:32:12,120 --> 02:32:13,650
He's thought about it.
Um,

3598
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:14,850
you know,
I think he's,

3599
02:32:14,851 --> 02:32:16,510
uh,
he's in the weed game right now.

3600
02:32:16,511 --> 02:32:19,650
It's making some money selling weed,
which is legal now.

3601
02:32:20,420 --> 02:32:22,140
So He's,
he's doing that.

3602
02:32:22,440 --> 02:32:23,420
What?
Wow.

3603
02:32:23,660 --> 02:32:26,130
Right.
Because the size of him now.

3604
02:32:26,370 --> 02:32:27,660
But he fought hardy,
right?

3605
02:32:27,810 --> 02:32:30,060
Yes.
He fought hardy and um,

3606
02:32:30,150 --> 02:32:31,920
he took him down,
which was interesting.

3607
02:32:31,921 --> 02:32:33,960
He didn't want to stand with them.
Wow.

3608
02:32:34,080 --> 02:32:35,340
Back in the day it was a different 
thing.

3609
02:32:35,341 --> 02:32:36,174
I mean,
they kind of made an agreement to stand 

3610
02:32:37,171 --> 02:32:39,360
with each other and then he was like,
bitch.

3611
02:32:39,750 --> 02:32:41,940
And he took him down and he won by 
decision,

3612
02:32:42,180 --> 02:32:43,770
but that was a different rumble.
Johnson,

3613
02:32:43,771 --> 02:32:47,610
I think the rumble Johnson at one 70,
he had no fucking energy.

3614
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,370
He was on death's door.
He was just always exhausted.

3615
02:32:50,371 --> 02:32:51,720
He would lose fights.
He just,

3616
02:32:51,990 --> 02:32:54,990
he got choked out by Josh Koscheck.
He was just too tired.

3617
02:32:55,280 --> 02:32:57,300
And I think,
wait king as well,

3618
02:32:57,301 --> 02:32:57,991
obviously,
you know,

3619
02:32:57,991 --> 02:33:00,060
there's been certain changes now,
but even now,

3620
02:33:00,400 --> 02:33:02,220
and I love Max Holloway,
but,

3621
02:33:02,410 --> 02:33:03,250
uh,
uh,

3622
02:33:03,430 --> 02:33:04,263
I think it was ufc embedded where they 
flew his favorite cupcake's over from 

3623
02:33:07,861 --> 02:33:09,720
Hawaii and he was like,
yeah,

3624
02:33:09,721 --> 02:33:10,950
I love cupcakes.
I've made weight.

3625
02:33:10,951 --> 02:33:11,870
And then he was just,
you know,

3626
02:33:12,040 --> 02:33:13,740
nailing cupcakes.
Smart.

3627
02:33:13,840 --> 02:33:14,673
No,
and I think there's just that element 

3628
02:33:16,230 --> 02:33:20,500
now that,
that I think as much as MMA has,

3629
02:33:20,501 --> 02:33:22,000
has evolved,
and,

3630
02:33:22,001 --> 02:33:22,834
and again,
this is someone who doesn't understand 

3631
02:33:23,670 --> 02:33:25,920
the technical aspects,
but as someone who loves,

3632
02:33:26,220 --> 02:33:28,140
uh,
kind of sports history,

3633
02:33:28,170 --> 02:33:29,640
you know,
and I've watched it and I'm just like,

3634
02:33:29,641 --> 02:33:32,780
that is amazing.
But it's still got so far to get.

3635
02:33:32,800 --> 02:33:34,290
Again,
we were talking earlier about,

3636
02:33:34,291 --> 02:33:36,750
you know,
football or soccer isn't in here back in

3637
02:33:36,751 --> 02:33:39,480
England and the warming up of the 
brandy,

3638
02:33:39,540 --> 02:33:40,350
you know,
in the,

3639
02:33:40,350 --> 02:33:41,183
in the changing rooms,
I think even now it's crazy when you 

3640
02:33:44,131 --> 02:33:44,964
have someone so gifted like that,
but they are rehydrating and re carb 

3641
02:33:49,351 --> 02:33:51,710
loading on cupcakes.
It's,

3642
02:33:51,790 --> 02:33:52,940
it's like,
yeah,

3643
02:33:53,310 --> 02:33:54,143
there are better,
there's way better ways you've caught 

3644
02:33:56,551 --> 02:33:57,384
weight.
Your body is basically in fight or 

3645
02:33:58,861 --> 02:33:59,750
flight,
you know,

3646
02:33:59,910 --> 02:34:02,590
you've subjected it to a form of micro 
trauma,

3647
02:34:02,790 --> 02:34:04,320
you know,
bodies kind of sitting there going,

3648
02:34:04,350 --> 02:34:06,870
Whoa,
is going on and um,

3649
02:34:07,080 --> 02:34:09,220
then you're going to get Hago he loves a
cupcake.

3650
02:34:09,221 --> 02:34:10,860
She made weight.
Yeah.

3651
02:34:10,861 --> 02:34:11,694
Yeah.
So I find that really interesting that 

3652
02:34:14,221 --> 02:34:15,670
you see some of the guys who,
you know,

3653
02:34:15,690 --> 02:34:17,830
was it [inaudible] tobacco?
Isn't it,

3654
02:34:17,831 --> 02:34:18,100
who

3655
02:34:18,100 --> 02:34:20,260
just like,
it was so big.

3656
02:34:20,350 --> 02:34:21,430
It was,
he got into,

3657
02:34:21,450 --> 02:34:22,283
it was like he said that he'd weigh in 
and then it would be like he sent his 

3658
02:34:24,251 --> 02:34:26,980
older brother in like they were 
unrecognizable.

3659
02:34:27,370 --> 02:34:28,620
Um,
and,

3660
02:34:28,660 --> 02:34:29,493
and,
and I think it's really interesting 

3661
02:34:30,071 --> 02:34:32,770
that,
that physiological puppetry,

3662
02:34:33,010 --> 02:34:35,560
if you know how to do it intelligently,
it can be so powerful,

3663
02:34:35,561 --> 02:34:37,030
but you do it for the wrong reasons,

3664
02:34:37,360 --> 02:34:39,010
but even if you know how to do it 
intelligently,

3665
02:34:39,011 --> 02:34:41,860
there's still a demand that it places on
your organs.

3666
02:34:41,861 --> 02:34:44,590
That's,
it's there's consequences,

3667
02:34:44,650 --> 02:34:47,560
right?
And over time your body resists it.

3668
02:34:47,561 --> 02:34:51,460
And this was the thought behind Max 
Holloway's last weight cutting fail,

3669
02:34:51,880 --> 02:34:52,713
is that when he was trying to cut down 
on short notice to fight Khabib Namaka 

3670
02:34:56,400 --> 02:34:57,233
Madoff,
he was cutting down only to one 55 and 

3671
02:34:59,561 --> 02:35:02,620
he couldn't make it.
And they pulled him out of that.

3672
02:35:02,621 --> 02:35:05,860
And then he started suffering some 
significant problems when he was getting

3673
02:35:05,861 --> 02:35:06,694
ready for Brian Ortega.
And they think that when he was ready 

3674
02:35:09,731 --> 02:35:10,564
for getting ready for a Tayga,
what was going on was his body was 

3675
02:35:13,540 --> 02:35:16,330
reacting to the fact that he was trying 
to cut weight again.

3676
02:35:16,331 --> 02:35:17,890
And it was like,
fuck you,

3677
02:35:18,160 --> 02:35:19,800
we just got through this man.
Right.

3678
02:35:19,810 --> 02:35:22,420
You know,
and he was like really messed up because

3679
02:35:22,421 --> 02:35:22,720
of it.

3680
02:35:22,720 --> 02:35:23,553
Right.
And he had to go through a battery of 

3681
02:35:24,821 --> 02:35:27,160
tests before they approved him to fight 
again.

3682
02:35:27,190 --> 02:35:28,023
So his body had to like fully fully 
recover months off and then get back to 

3683
02:35:32,201 --> 02:35:33,820
training and now he's okay again.
But,

3684
02:35:33,970 --> 02:35:35,650
but I think it's changing.
I mean now,

3685
02:35:35,651 --> 02:35:37,090
I mean Frankie Edgar was almost the 
fest.

3686
02:35:37,091 --> 02:35:38,720
He would wake,
you have to fight like five pounds.

3687
02:35:38,740 --> 02:35:40,780
He wouldn't even cut weight.
He wouldn't cut any weight.

3688
02:35:40,810 --> 02:35:41,950
Yeah,
that was his way.

3689
02:35:41,980 --> 02:35:43,270
Well there,
this is what they say,

3690
02:35:43,420 --> 02:35:44,253
Frankie,
although was the 155 pound champion and 

3691
02:35:46,961 --> 02:35:50,170
now competes at 145 pounds.
Really?

3692
02:35:50,290 --> 02:35:55,290
He should be fighting at one 35 and then
one 35 is where he could be at his best.

3693
02:35:56,680 --> 02:35:58,180
That's what everybody says.
Wow.

3694
02:35:58,240 --> 02:35:59,073
Especially people that know like weight 
cutting and they look at what he walks 

3695
02:36:01,931 --> 02:36:03,100
around and like,
look,

3696
02:36:03,101 --> 02:36:07,420
20 pounds from 55 ain't shit.
You know those guys do it all the time.

3697
02:36:07,421 --> 02:36:08,254
Especially you get a guy like a George 
Lockhart who really knows how to do it 

3698
02:36:11,141 --> 02:36:13,210
and put that weight back on you,
you know,

3699
02:36:13,211 --> 02:36:15,970
and how to do it correctly.
Scientifically,

3700
02:36:16,570 --> 02:36:19,450
it's a big W we're seeing that now 
across all sports.

3701
02:36:19,451 --> 02:36:21,400
I think this evolution that we're 
understanding,

3702
02:36:22,260 --> 02:36:24,420
I skin Carlin aisles,
he's one of my favorite.

3703
02:36:24,421 --> 02:36:26,770
So he was a,
a good American sprinter.

3704
02:36:26,800 --> 02:36:27,940
He was,
I believe,

3705
02:36:27,941 --> 02:36:29,110
you know,
top 50 you know,

3706
02:36:29,111 --> 02:36:30,490
he was,
he was amazing,

3707
02:36:30,860 --> 02:36:32,410
but it wasn't quite making it,
you know,

3708
02:36:32,411 --> 02:36:34,360
he's not a Usain bolt,
he's not adjusting Gatlin.

3709
02:36:34,750 --> 02:36:36,400
So they just said,
Hey Colin,

3710
02:36:36,401 --> 02:36:37,690
here's a,
here's a rugby ball.

3711
02:36:37,990 --> 02:36:41,140
And again,
it'll be on youtube some ways like,

3712
02:36:41,141 --> 02:36:41,974
you know,
why do you regard as the fastest route 

3713
02:36:43,051 --> 02:36:44,500
comply?
They just handed him,

3714
02:36:44,710 --> 02:36:47,500
you know,
and now there's one of my favorite clips

3715
02:36:47,501 --> 02:36:48,334
because he,
it was one of his first games or 

3716
02:36:49,481 --> 02:36:50,314
something and I think it was an 
Australian commentator and he just ran 

3717
02:36:53,411 --> 02:36:57,760
like rings around everybody.
Scott as score to try.

3718
02:36:57,761 --> 02:36:59,040
And then the commentator was like,
was,

3719
02:36:59,150 --> 02:36:59,831
oh my God,
it goes,

3720
02:36:59,831 --> 02:37:01,930
I cannot believe this.
Can you believe?

3721
02:37:02,140 --> 02:37:03,190
Here we go,
look,

3722
02:37:03,280 --> 02:37:04,570
here we go.
Here's the ball.

3723
02:37:04,720 --> 02:37:05,890
Oh my God,
look at him.

3724
02:37:05,891 --> 02:37:08,650
Go Goodbye.
That is insane.

3725
02:37:08,850 --> 02:37:12,430
This is rugby sevens.
Oh my God,

3726
02:37:12,431 --> 02:37:13,360
they're all quitting.
But like,

3727
02:37:14,680 --> 02:37:16,040
look,
the guy chasing gave

3728
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:17,330
that guy,
there's more,

3729
02:37:17,331 --> 02:37:18,830
this is absurd.
I love corners.

3730
02:37:18,840 --> 02:37:19,673
And,
and he ran past him like the guy was 

3731
02:37:21,681 --> 02:37:23,080
ahead of them.
This new law,

3732
02:37:23,150 --> 02:37:25,670
I'm not even going to sites that you 
because I don't,

3733
02:37:25,730 --> 02:37:26,563
he,
it's like he doesn't even respect their 

3734
02:37:28,011 --> 02:37:28,844
speed.
Look how much faster he is in those 

3735
02:37:30,591 --> 02:37:32,240
guys.
That's hilarious.

3736
02:37:32,700 --> 02:37:35,390
Was that all in many ways,
right?

3737
02:37:35,391 --> 02:37:39,410
Isn't it like that other guy who broke 
the world record by rowing and he'd been

3738
02:37:39,411 --> 02:37:40,244
doing something else and gotten so much 
power and energy in his body that he 

3739
02:37:45,471 --> 02:37:47,570
could translate that to,
to rowing.

3740
02:37:47,600 --> 02:37:48,980
And we're seeing that now,
but,

3741
02:37:48,981 --> 02:37:51,240
and that was what was amazing there with
we call him.

3742
02:37:51,260 --> 02:37:51,651
I was,
like I said,

3743
02:37:51,651 --> 02:37:52,850
he scored her,
he's got to try.

3744
02:37:52,851 --> 02:37:53,684
And then the commentator,
there was two commentators talking and 

3745
02:37:54,741 --> 02:37:55,574
said,
I can't believe he's only been playing 

3746
02:37:56,510 --> 02:37:58,640
in a number of months,
and that they were like,

3747
02:37:58,641 --> 02:37:58,941
yeah,
no,

3748
02:37:58,941 --> 02:37:59,600
that's amazing.

3749
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:01,460
And then the other commentary you said,
no,

3750
02:38:01,461 --> 02:38:01,731
no,
no,

3751
02:38:01,731 --> 02:38:02,564
I can believe it.
He's just tried to give the referee the 

3752
02:38:03,681 --> 02:38:04,514
ball and he didn't know what to do.
He'd scored a try and he was walking 

3753
02:38:08,031 --> 02:38:09,610
around and he gave it to him.
No,

3754
02:38:09,620 --> 02:38:09,860
no,
no.

3755
02:38:09,860 --> 02:38:10,790
You know,
kick it.

3756
02:38:10,791 --> 02:38:12,890
You know,
it was amazing.

3757
02:38:12,950 --> 02:38:14,300
They didn't bother teaching them.
They're like,

3758
02:38:14,301 --> 02:38:15,770
just listen man.
Just run.

3759
02:38:16,380 --> 02:38:17,213
But what do I do when I get to the,
I just get to the end and then we'll 

3760
02:38:18,861 --> 02:38:21,830
talk and I'll tell you what to do.
It'll take about three minutes.

3761
02:38:22,970 --> 02:38:24,250
They do.
They do.

3762
02:38:24,260 --> 02:38:28,040
And you just run baby.
You're seeing it.

3763
02:38:28,041 --> 02:38:30,620
And I think it's incredible.
You spoke about this not too long ago,

3764
02:38:30,621 --> 02:38:31,454
but I think you might've mentioned 
Lebron James saying if someone like 

3765
02:38:33,411 --> 02:38:34,580
that,
I was taught mma.

3766
02:38:34,610 --> 02:38:36,020
Oh my God,
everybody would be dead.

3767
02:38:36,080 --> 02:38:36,913
What would happen?
And I think we're seeing that now that 

3768
02:38:39,350 --> 02:38:41,480
you know,
sports now there's more money,

3769
02:38:41,481 --> 02:38:42,314
you know,
in mma and it's evolved to what it is 

3770
02:38:44,001 --> 02:38:45,530
now.
It's amazing that if you get,

3771
02:38:45,710 --> 02:38:48,650
you know,
some unbelievable phenom as a kid,

3772
02:38:48,651 --> 02:38:50,540
you go go into mma.
Yeah.

3773
02:38:50,541 --> 02:38:51,410
But it's not as

3774
02:38:51,710 --> 02:38:55,600
peeler is basketball and it doesn't pay 
as much money as Lebron James makes.

3775
02:38:56,140 --> 02:38:57,280
Lebron James,
what does he make?

3776
02:38:57,400 --> 02:39:00,850
$100 million a year,
something crazy just from basketball.

3777
02:39:00,851 --> 02:39:04,390
It's like 35 or so,
35 million just from basketball.

3778
02:39:05,190 --> 02:39:08,450
And then sponsorships,
like unless you're conor Mcgregor,

3779
02:39:08,480 --> 02:39:09,313
floyd mayweather,
you're not gonna make that much money 

3780
02:39:10,391 --> 02:39:11,224
from fighting.
They can make that much money from 

3781
02:39:12,641 --> 02:39:14,170
fighting,
but they're so rare.

3782
02:39:14,710 --> 02:39:15,543
And then connor could only make that 
much money from fighting if he box 

3783
02:39:18,131 --> 02:39:21,760
floyd.
Like even though the fight with Kobi was

3784
02:39:21,761 --> 02:39:24,940
the number one mma paper view of all 
time,

3785
02:39:24,941 --> 02:39:25,774
the number two paper view in the history
of paper views just behind a floyd 

3786
02:39:29,801 --> 02:39:33,400
mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao.
Right.

3787
02:39:33,430 --> 02:39:37,510
It got more paper view bys then floyd 
mayweather versus conor Mcgregor,

3788
02:39:37,540 --> 02:39:40,150
I believe.
I believe that's true.

3789
02:39:40,450 --> 02:39:41,650
Wow.
Look that up.

3790
02:39:42,100 --> 02:39:42,933
I think it was 2.2
million for floyd mayweather versus 

3791
02:39:45,970 --> 02:39:46,803
conor Mcgregor and then 2.4
million for floyd mayweather versus 

3792
02:39:51,191 --> 02:39:54,280
Khabib neurohacker grumet off.
I think it was number two of all time.

3793
02:39:54,300 --> 02:39:55,133
Why?
Just behind the floyd mayweather or 

3794
02:39:56,621 --> 02:39:58,540
manny Pacquiao fight,
which is just incredible.

3795
02:39:58,900 --> 02:40:02,050
So they must've made a shit ton of money
from that.

3796
02:40:02,200 --> 02:40:05,650
But how many times can connor do that?
Don't,

3797
02:40:05,790 --> 02:40:06,790
you know,
I mean look,

3798
02:40:06,791 --> 02:40:07,624
the Irish support him,
but people thought he had a chance of 

3799
02:40:09,761 --> 02:40:12,610
winning that fight and then once he gets
smashed like that,

3800
02:40:13,350 --> 02:40:13,980
I don't think they're

3801
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:14,813
going to think he has a chance of 
winning again unless he does something 

3802
02:40:16,920 --> 02:40:18,360
significant.
Right,

3803
02:40:18,510 --> 02:40:19,440
right.
Yeah.

3804
02:40:19,470 --> 02:40:23,640
He has to beat somebody like he has to 
fight like Kevin Lee and fuck him up.

3805
02:40:24,180 --> 02:40:26,400
You know,
if you fought Kevin Lee or Tony Ferguson

3806
02:40:26,401 --> 02:40:29,130
and fucked him up and then you know,
said look,

3807
02:40:29,131 --> 02:40:31,380
I had two years off,
I wasn't ready for could be,

3808
02:40:31,381 --> 02:40:32,214
but I'm ready now.
Fuck the mayweathers and he said 

3809
02:40:33,941 --> 02:40:35,880
something like that.
People,

3810
02:40:36,090 --> 02:40:37,680
he's got to have some success though.

3811
02:40:38,690 --> 02:40:41,240
Floyd Connor was 6.7
million.

3812
02:40:41,510 --> 02:40:42,343
Floyd manny was 4.4
million and then it would have been 

3813
02:40:45,171 --> 02:40:47,450
right around the next one,
which has been Oscar and floyd,

3814
02:40:47,451 --> 02:40:49,850
which is 2.4
so he has to say 2.5

3815
02:40:49,851 --> 02:40:51,180
2.4
so I've been right around number.

3816
02:40:51,181 --> 02:40:53,630
So it was number three then number three
overall,

3817
02:40:53,631 --> 02:40:54,830
number one,
mma,

3818
02:40:54,960 --> 02:40:55,793
number one mma.
But number three overall it could be 

3819
02:40:57,331 --> 02:40:58,164
tied.
So what would the one of the boxing 

3820
02:40:59,071 --> 02:40:59,570
numbers again,

3821
02:40:59,570 --> 02:41:00,710
what was it,
6.7

3822
02:41:00,711 --> 02:41:02,660
for the floyd conner,
4.4

3823
02:41:02,810 --> 02:41:04,100
for floyd.
Manny.

3824
02:41:04,190 --> 02:41:05,360
Wow.
That is so crazy.

3825
02:41:05,361 --> 02:41:08,090
6.7
for floyd connor wide.

3826
02:41:08,091 --> 02:41:08,924
My numbers off big time.
But the amount of money that that will 

3827
02:41:13,430 --> 02:41:16,490
it,
it's so interesting that you know,

3828
02:41:16,491 --> 02:41:19,520
with that phone around this kind of 
extrinsic motivation,

3829
02:41:19,521 --> 02:41:23,360
money,
media fame versus intrinsic motivation.

3830
02:41:23,361 --> 02:41:23,991
And,
and in a,

3831
02:41:23,991 --> 02:41:26,970
in a strange way with the swim,
you know,

3832
02:41:27,170 --> 02:41:29,270
when we got around John Groups at the 
top,

3833
02:41:29,271 --> 02:41:30,260
it was a,
everyone was like,

3834
02:41:30,350 --> 02:41:30,751
yeah,
yeah,

3835
02:41:30,751 --> 02:41:32,960
you just set the land's end to John 
O'groats record,

3836
02:41:32,961 --> 02:41:34,040
well done.
And those cameras.

3837
02:41:34,041 --> 02:41:34,874
And it was amazing.
And then I was just swimming across the 

3838
02:41:36,441 --> 02:41:38,330
Murray firth getting hit by jellyfish 
in,

3839
02:41:38,331 --> 02:41:39,550
you know,
six degree water.

3840
02:41:39,570 --> 02:41:40,580
It was just horrible.
And,

3841
02:41:40,581 --> 02:41:41,414
and,
and I think,

3842
02:41:41,960 --> 02:41:46,220
I think right now as well,
and Khabib fascinates me that,

3843
02:41:46,850 --> 02:41:48,680
you know,
and I don't know the logistics again,

3844
02:41:48,681 --> 02:41:49,514
you know,
I've been at sea so I'm still trying to 

3845
02:41:50,541 --> 02:41:52,370
catch up,
but he was offered so much money for the

3846
02:41:52,371 --> 02:41:55,070
rematch,
but I believe he turned it down.

3847
02:41:55,170 --> 02:41:59,600
It could be no,
there was talk of a rematch,

3848
02:41:59,601 --> 02:42:02,650
but the UFC did not offer him.
Right.

3849
02:42:03,200 --> 02:42:05,060
Financial.
Some of those rumors,

3850
02:42:05,240 --> 02:42:06,073
they hadn't even talked,
they were trying to figure out what to 

3851
02:42:07,611 --> 02:42:08,444
do next.
And in fact the UFC said that most 

3852
02:42:10,191 --> 02:42:12,260
likely next was Tony Ferguson.
Okay.

3853
02:42:12,410 --> 02:42:13,250
Okay.
So that's,

3854
02:42:13,251 --> 02:42:14,084
that's the current,
the last time they talked about someone 

3855
02:42:16,671 --> 02:42:19,760
fighting for the title again,
but it was a while ago now again,

3856
02:42:19,820 --> 02:42:22,400
it might be UFC embedded when I,
and I think it was when,

3857
02:42:22,401 --> 02:42:25,970
could be years ago now,
met George Saint Pierre and could be,

3858
02:42:26,120 --> 02:42:26,790
you know,
said,

3859
02:42:26,790 --> 02:42:30,170
oh I'd lovely to meet you and then just,
and then it could be with smiling and he

3860
02:42:30,171 --> 02:42:31,004
said,
Oh,

3861
02:42:31,250 --> 02:42:33,080
you know,
my dad has always said that he'd love to

3862
02:42:33,081 --> 02:42:33,914
see me fight George St Pierre.
And for me that was really interesting 

3863
02:42:36,291 --> 02:42:37,124
because it could be some motivation 
seems to be intrinsic and putting his 

3864
02:42:42,351 --> 02:42:43,760
skills against the best people in the 
world.

3865
02:42:43,760 --> 02:42:45,230
You could offer more than money in the 
world,

3866
02:42:45,410 --> 02:42:47,840
but he just wants to do something.
When he talks about his dad,

3867
02:42:47,841 --> 02:42:50,420
his family,
and it's a different beast.

3868
02:42:50,660 --> 02:42:52,850
And that's what I find really 
interesting.

3869
02:42:52,880 --> 02:42:53,960
That,
but,

3870
02:42:53,961 --> 02:42:54,794
but,
but I'm not saying different as in 

3871
02:42:56,121 --> 02:42:56,931
better,
worse,

3872
02:42:56,931 --> 02:42:57,764
good or bad,
because ultimately mayweather's never 

3873
02:42:59,391 --> 02:43:00,224
lost.
But when you see someone like 

3874
02:43:00,681 --> 02:43:02,150
mayweather,
you think easy,

3875
02:43:02,180 --> 02:43:04,740
just an extrinsically motivated.
When he's saying it,

3876
02:43:04,741 --> 02:43:06,380
if it doesn't make money,
it doesn't make sense.

3877
02:43:06,620 --> 02:43:08,150
You kind of look at him going,
well,

3878
02:43:09,020 --> 02:43:11,410
you're extrinsically motivated,
arguably.

3879
02:43:11,411 --> 02:43:12,040
And I don't know,
I've

3880
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:13,420
never met the guy and stuff.
But you,

3881
02:43:13,421 --> 02:43:14,254
you're,
you're extrinsic motivator but you'd 

3882
02:43:15,251 --> 02:43:17,620
never lost.
So which one's more powerful?

3883
02:43:17,680 --> 02:43:20,920
I don't think he's completely 
extrinsically motivated.

3884
02:43:20,921 --> 02:43:24,400
I think that's a lot of it is an act.
Do you think he's too good,

3885
02:43:25,150 --> 02:43:25,983
too good?
There's,

3886
02:43:26,050 --> 02:43:26,411
I mean,
there,

3887
02:43:26,411 --> 02:43:27,244
there has to be some,
some deep emotional connection to his 

3888
02:43:30,851 --> 02:43:31,684
work.
There's gotta be some connection to his 

3889
02:43:33,341 --> 02:43:34,174
legacy.
What he's been able to do the way he's 

3890
02:43:35,861 --> 02:43:39,370
been able to retire undefeated as a 
professional boxer,

3891
02:43:39,371 --> 02:43:41,020
which is almost unheard of.
Right.

3892
02:43:41,080 --> 02:43:43,920
Cause I want to believe that.
And I hope that's true because,

3893
02:43:43,930 --> 02:43:44,763
because you're almost taught like 
intrinsic motivation did it for the 

3894
02:43:47,051 --> 02:43:47,920
love,
you know,

3895
02:43:47,921 --> 02:43:51,370
in sort of unit the sweet science.
I want to believe that may wave is there

3896
02:43:51,371 --> 02:43:53,320
and he's studying it.
If it may be,

3897
02:43:53,321 --> 02:43:54,940
he doesn't want you to see that side.

3898
02:43:55,350 --> 02:43:56,800
He's too good.
Right.

3899
02:43:57,160 --> 02:43:59,980
He's too good.
He's kind of have a love of boxing.

3900
02:44:00,010 --> 02:44:05,010
There's no way he's too good the way he,
he's artistically taking guys apart.

3901
02:44:05,411 --> 02:44:09,520
Like you go to the Canelo Alvarez fight.
The way he was like it was slipping away

3902
02:44:09,521 --> 02:44:13,060
from Canelo was big shots and then 
popping them with the jabs like pitch.

3903
02:44:13,080 --> 02:44:14,590
Yeah.
Not Today.

3904
02:44:15,010 --> 02:44:17,530
Not Today man.
Good enough for this.

3905
02:44:17,820 --> 02:44:18,653
And it was intelligent in his approach 
to that fight too cause he made canelo 

3906
02:44:21,381 --> 02:44:24,640
drain himself to get down to 150 pounds.
Right,

3907
02:44:24,641 --> 02:44:25,474
right.
That was a different thing cause he 

3908
02:44:26,590 --> 02:44:30,790
forced Canelo to cut a lot of weight to 
get down to his weight class.

3909
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:32,193
But it'd been,
floyd really realistically is 147 pound 

3910
02:44:34,391 --> 02:44:35,224
fighter.
I mean he's only fighting in these 

3911
02:44:35,951 --> 02:44:37,690
higher weight classes cause the money's 
there.

3912
02:44:38,280 --> 02:44:40,510
It's a fucking wizard man.
He's a wizard.

3913
02:44:40,511 --> 02:44:42,850
But that's what I mean about like that 
that will start,

3914
02:44:43,210 --> 02:44:45,010
you know,
he's playing with everybody's head.

3915
02:44:45,280 --> 02:44:47,290
You talk about like psychological 
warfare,

3916
02:44:47,291 --> 02:44:49,060
you know,
the art of war and everything like that.

3917
02:44:49,270 --> 02:44:53,590
And he's doing it on a mass scale like 
we've probably never experienced before.

3918
02:44:53,620 --> 02:44:54,453
Well,
what was fascinating was connor was 

3919
02:44:55,241 --> 02:44:58,240
doing it to him and was screaming in his
face with a hard on,

3920
02:44:58,241 --> 02:44:59,630
by the way,
at the way in.

3921
02:44:59,640 --> 02:45:01,370
So I don't know how he generated a 
harder one,

3922
02:45:02,020 --> 02:45:03,280
but uh,
you know,

3923
02:45:03,281 --> 02:45:05,410
he must have played with his deck before
he got out there.

3924
02:45:05,700 --> 02:45:06,533
It took some Viagra or something.
I really think that might've been part 

3925
02:45:08,861 --> 02:45:13,000
of the psychological motivations that 
just screaming in his face,

3926
02:45:13,001 --> 02:45:15,730
I'm gonna fucking kill you a little puke
you piece of shit.

3927
02:45:15,970 --> 02:45:19,290
And flow is just like this,
just dead face staring at them.

3928
02:45:19,320 --> 02:45:20,153
Right.
Didn't scream back dead face stayed 

3929
02:45:21,611 --> 02:45:26,611
comms like tomorrow I am going to fuck 
you up and there ain't no god damn thing

3930
02:45:26,771 --> 02:45:27,230
in the world.

3931
02:45:27,230 --> 02:45:28,510
It's going to change there.
Right,

3932
02:45:28,540 --> 02:45:29,373
right.
Well Connor was like the first guy that 

3933
02:45:30,821 --> 02:45:34,090
floyd ever fought that could fuck him up
in a real fight though.

3934
02:45:34,160 --> 02:45:34,840
Right.
That was the,

3935
02:45:34,840 --> 02:45:35,673
there was a different element of danger 
there because there was an agreed upon 

3936
02:45:38,621 --> 02:45:41,050
rule set where connor wasn't going to 
kick,

3937
02:45:41,051 --> 02:45:42,910
wasn't going to take them down.
What's going to strangle them.

3938
02:45:43,210 --> 02:45:46,210
So because of that,
floyd knew he could win,

3939
02:45:46,630 --> 02:45:51,550
but he also knew without a doubt,
if they were just going to fight,

3940
02:45:51,551 --> 02:45:53,770
fight.
If there was no gloves,

3941
02:45:53,880 --> 02:45:56,590
if they just put the gloves aside and 
just had a street fight,

3942
02:45:56,920 --> 02:46:01,920
connor would fucking kill him.
I mean there's not a question on my mind

3943
02:46:03,100 --> 02:46:06,160
is not that not,
there's not a doubt to be had.

3944
02:46:06,550 --> 02:46:10,100
Connor would kick him from a distance.
He would probe him with

3945
02:46:10,100 --> 02:46:11,750
front kicks,
kick his legs,

3946
02:46:12,410 --> 02:46:15,180
floyd would start to limp.
Connor would step in,

3947
02:46:15,290 --> 02:46:17,210
tie him up,
elbow him,

3948
02:46:17,211 --> 02:46:20,030
take him down,
smash his face into a bloody pulp,

3949
02:46:20,031 --> 02:46:22,310
do whatever you want it to him,
strangle him,

3950
02:46:22,490 --> 02:46:25,910
rip his knees apart with leg locks.
You can do whatever he want it to them.

3951
02:46:26,120 --> 02:46:27,680
If they were going to just fight,
fight,

3952
02:46:28,310 --> 02:46:30,050
you know.
And he said that to him and he's like,

3953
02:46:30,051 --> 02:46:34,010
if this was a fight at fucking kill you,
he just looked right at him.

3954
02:46:34,011 --> 02:46:36,380
And he's saying that to him.
Floyd had to just eat it,

3955
02:46:36,890 --> 02:46:38,360
but it didn't matter because it wasn't a
fight.

3956
02:46:38,361 --> 02:46:40,250
It was a boxing match and he didn't have
a chance.

3957
02:46:40,470 --> 02:46:42,630
But do you think that worked with Aldo 
for instance?

3958
02:46:42,631 --> 02:46:43,890
Because,
and again,

3959
02:46:43,920 --> 02:46:45,710
this is me kind of just talking more on 
the,

3960
02:46:45,711 --> 02:46:49,410
the mental warfare side and not really 
understanding the technical aspect.

3961
02:46:49,710 --> 02:46:54,640
But that world tour was fascinating to 
watch and the whole way round.

3962
02:46:54,641 --> 02:46:55,474
And,
and again,

3963
02:46:55,560 --> 02:46:56,393
um,
this is me not understanding all that 

3964
02:46:58,081 --> 02:47:00,660
much about him and maybe being 
fascinated with a mental aspect that,

3965
02:47:00,950 --> 02:47:01,621
uh,
and again,

3966
02:47:01,621 --> 02:47:03,450
George Saint Pierre,
when he fought Nick Diaz and,

3967
02:47:03,451 --> 02:47:04,260
and they were saying,
you know,

3968
02:47:04,260 --> 02:47:06,510
we're going to,
he's going to talk to you and he's going

3969
02:47:06,511 --> 02:47:08,130
to talk to you.
He's going to walk you down.

3970
02:47:08,580 --> 02:47:09,870
Don't be effected.
And George St Pierre,

3971
02:47:09,871 --> 02:47:10,591
was that across?
Yeah,

3972
02:47:10,591 --> 02:47:11,424
I won't be.
And then he was talking so much that I 

3973
02:47:13,380 --> 02:47:14,213
even said it just invoked again,
actually going back to what we were 

3974
02:47:16,471 --> 02:47:17,510
talking about,
you know,

3975
02:47:17,520 --> 02:47:18,353
our bodies,
as much as we like to think about it as 

3976
02:47:19,621 --> 02:47:23,910
black and white,
the complex biochemical organisms.

3977
02:47:24,030 --> 02:47:26,130
So when I,
and I'm not saying that,

3978
02:47:26,131 --> 02:47:28,290
you know,
the Diaz brothers necessarily think like

3979
02:47:28,291 --> 02:47:28,640
that,
but they,

3980
02:47:28,640 --> 02:47:31,510
but I'm going to talk to you and I'm 
going to mess with your mechanic.

3981
02:47:31,540 --> 02:47:32,373
Do you know the,
the chemical reactions within your body 

3982
02:47:34,051 --> 02:47:36,690
neurotransmitters and making you fought

3983
02:47:37,080 --> 02:47:38,750
the mind?
Fuck you.

3984
02:47:39,380 --> 02:47:40,550
They're doing it for sure.
They're dumb.

3985
02:47:40,610 --> 02:47:43,060
They're not stupid.
When Nick's doing that too,

3986
02:47:43,070 --> 02:47:43,940
he's like,
what bitch?

3987
02:47:43,970 --> 02:47:46,010
Which going to a bitch?
He's fucking with your head,

3988
02:47:46,011 --> 02:47:48,440
man.
I remember the first time he did that to

3989
02:47:48,441 --> 02:47:49,274
Robbie lawler.
Robbie was like 2021 years old and nick 

3990
02:47:51,681 --> 02:47:53,630
was young too,
and they're both standing to the,

3991
02:47:53,870 --> 02:47:57,740
they moved into the cage and they closed
it and nick has just started saying,

3992
02:47:57,741 --> 02:48:00,320
stockton motherfucker,
Stoughton bribee Laura was like,

3993
02:48:00,321 --> 02:48:02,600
what?
And he's like standing in front of them.

3994
02:48:02,810 --> 02:48:03,643
That's against Carlos condit.
He drops the best one was against 

3995
02:48:06,291 --> 02:48:07,124
Anderson Silva.
He fell to the ground and pretended he 

3996
02:48:09,291 --> 02:48:10,124
was sleeping.
He put his hands together like he's 

3997
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:15,230
taking a nap and laid down and I 
couldn't stop laughing.

3998
02:48:15,231 --> 02:48:17,600
I was like,
this mother fucker is so crazy.

3999
02:48:18,170 --> 02:48:21,680
He just like right there,
drop down instead of relaxing,

4000
02:48:21,681 --> 02:48:24,290
go to the back,
go back.

4001
02:48:24,320 --> 02:48:25,400
That one's better.
Yeah.

4002
02:48:25,570 --> 02:48:29,870
So when you see him lay down and leaned 
on his head like,

4003
02:48:29,880 --> 02:48:32,390
I'm just going to take a nap here.
Like what are you doing bitch?

4004
02:48:32,760 --> 02:48:35,360
Anderson Silva did forrest Griffin and 
has done all his career,

4005
02:48:35,390 --> 02:48:40,390
but he's doing this to a guy who's the 
187 85 pound rather best ever.

4006
02:48:41,831 --> 02:48:44,780
Right.
And he's not even 185 pounder.

4007
02:48:45,200 --> 02:48:47,540
He's really a one 55 pounder.
I mean,

4008
02:48:47,541 --> 02:48:48,374
Nick Diaz,
when he was a champion in strike force 

4009
02:48:50,210 --> 02:48:52,190
or lead xc lead XC,
right.

4010
02:48:52,490 --> 02:48:54,980
He was a 155 pound champion.

4011
02:48:55,300 --> 02:48:56,133
Well,
what's amazing here is everything that 

4012
02:48:57,111 --> 02:48:59,480
we talked about in terms of intangibles,
mind,

4013
02:48:59,481 --> 02:49:03,320
body connection.
Nick is imposing his mind,

4014
02:49:03,321 --> 02:49:05,390
body connection on Anderson in that he's
going to,

4015
02:49:05,391 --> 02:49:07,740
I'm going to mess with y'all fucking 
with head for sure.

4016
02:49:07,920 --> 02:49:08,170
What

4017
02:49:08,170 --> 02:49:09,450
will,
was he the champ?

4018
02:49:09,451 --> 02:49:10,284
Why am I not remembering it?
Was it elite Xc or strike force that 

4019
02:49:13,081 --> 02:49:16,200
Nick Diaz was the champion of?
It might've been strike force.

4020
02:49:17,180 --> 02:49:18,013
Okay.

4021
02:49:18,060 --> 02:49:19,500
Why can't I remember?
Sorry.

4022
02:49:19,980 --> 02:49:20,910
Yeah,
why?

4023
02:49:20,940 --> 02:49:22,300
Well,
why did I think a leader Xc,

4024
02:49:22,310 --> 02:49:23,760
see,
no,

4025
02:49:23,940 --> 02:49:25,680
he,
I'll use the fought elite xc.

4026
02:49:25,681 --> 02:49:26,970
Did he?
Oh,

4027
02:49:27,060 --> 02:49:29,250
okay.
Now I remember because,

4028
02:49:30,460 --> 02:49:31,010
okay.

4029
02:49:31,010 --> 02:49:34,610
That was because mayhem Miller and uh,

4030
02:49:37,240 --> 02:49:42,240
jake shields had a brawl in elite xc and
Nick Diaz was a part of the brawl.

4031
02:49:44,440 --> 02:49:47,110
They're all piled on each other and that
was chaos.

4032
02:49:47,200 --> 02:49:49,690
But Stripe,
that was him pull daily,

4033
02:49:50,170 --> 02:49:55,170
that knock out.
But also just kind of like fell and,

4034
02:49:55,211 --> 02:49:56,170
and uh,
so it's,

4035
02:49:56,650 --> 02:50:00,310
it's so strange that this intangible,
this thing that I'm now fascinated.

4036
02:50:00,311 --> 02:50:02,050
We've liked men,
Kj noons elite XC.

4037
02:50:02,051 --> 02:50:03,550
So he did fight him in a next,
see?

4038
02:50:03,850 --> 02:50:04,683
That's right.
So he finally Dixie and then became 

4039
02:50:05,891 --> 02:50:07,870
strikeforce champion.
That's why I'm confused.

4040
02:50:08,290 --> 02:50:09,123
Wow.
Yeah.

4041
02:50:09,570 --> 02:50:13,120
Um,
that whatever mayweather did differently

4042
02:50:13,121 --> 02:50:16,750
to Aldo might have been granted 
different sports granted,

4043
02:50:16,751 --> 02:50:19,060
but there was something that mcgregor 
was like,

4044
02:50:19,061 --> 02:50:21,490
it's not working the way that when he 
pinched,

4045
02:50:21,730 --> 02:50:23,300
you know,
de has neck and shoulder,

4046
02:50:23,301 --> 02:50:25,330
I turn around and you know,
again,

4047
02:50:25,331 --> 02:50:27,040
without understanding the technical 
element there was,

4048
02:50:27,041 --> 02:50:29,470
for me,
it was so fascinating watching the two.

4049
02:50:29,470 --> 02:50:30,303
And like you said,
mayweather stood there completely stoic 

4050
02:50:33,570 --> 02:50:38,570
Aldo was not comfortable with it and he 
lost his composure and he attacked,

4051
02:50:38,980 --> 02:50:42,460
he attacked connor in a way that exposed
him.

4052
02:50:42,500 --> 02:50:44,530
He,
he got exposed to a counter shot.

4053
02:50:44,560 --> 02:50:46,210
He was,
he wasn't patient.

4054
02:50:46,450 --> 02:50:47,283
He was very emotional and he just wanted
to fuck that dude up and he just got 

4055
02:50:49,841 --> 02:50:50,710
clipped.
Right,

4056
02:50:50,740 --> 02:50:51,311
right.
You know,

4057
02:50:51,311 --> 02:50:52,144
and look,
connor played in perfectly played them 

4058
02:50:53,801 --> 02:50:54,880
like a fiddle.
Yeah.

4059
02:50:54,970 --> 02:50:55,900
Yeah.
Hey Man,

4060
02:50:55,901 --> 02:50:57,810
I've got to wrap this up.
It's already five buck.

4061
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,100
We just went three hours.
Believe it or not.

4062
02:51:02,070 --> 02:51:03,220
No,
don't be sorry.

4063
02:51:03,221 --> 02:51:04,930
It was awesome.
I really appreciate it.

4064
02:51:04,960 --> 02:51:09,190
And uh,
what you did is beyond impressive man.

4065
02:51:09,220 --> 02:51:10,053
I mean,
it's fascinating stuff and I feel like 

4066
02:51:11,651 --> 02:51:13,480
we could do a hundred of these kinds of 
conversations.

4067
02:51:13,481 --> 02:51:15,940
Don't so sorry.
I'll often even in Los Angeles.

4068
02:51:16,030 --> 02:51:16,670
Uh,
no,

4069
02:51:16,670 --> 02:51:17,890
this is my first time.
Oh,

4070
02:51:17,891 --> 02:51:20,700
we'll come back and visit again,
man.

4071
02:51:20,890 --> 02:51:22,140
Next time you gonna to swim to the moon,

4072
02:51:22,360 --> 02:51:24,510
let me know.
This is here.

4073
02:51:24,550 --> 02:51:28,480
I honestly like next time we'll get,
we'll get burton again for the record.

4074
02:51:28,481 --> 02:51:31,330
He's an amazing physical specimen of a 
fat guy.

4075
02:51:31,331 --> 02:51:35,850
Right.
We'll go swimming or like,

4076
02:51:36,460 --> 02:51:37,410
okay,
we'll do something.

4077
02:51:37,950 --> 02:51:38,620
We'll,
