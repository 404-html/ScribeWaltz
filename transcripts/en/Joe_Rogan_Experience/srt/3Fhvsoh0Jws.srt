1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,480
Hello,
sweet pitches.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,070
That's right.
The time has come.

3
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,620
Once again,
our I should fear as eaton box.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,650
This episode is brought to you by legal 
zoom.

5
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:15,651
Legal zooms away,
a convenient way to deal with a lot of 

6
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:18,531
your legal shit that you would normally 
have to go to a lawyer to deal with it 

7
00:00:18,531 --> 00:00:21,030
online and deal with it naked can be 
drunk.

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,970
Nobody can stop you.
You could.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,520
You could say after everything that you 
write lies,

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,360
you can say that lie.
You can say your call Phil.

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,990
Yeah,
you could.

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,170
You could curse the world,
curse God himself as you're signing 

13
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,641
legal documents.
You could be having sex and getting an 

14
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:40,980
LLC at the same time.
No one can stop you.

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,820
You have ultimate freedom because this 
all exists in the virtual world.

16
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:48,000
You don't have to worry about pulling 
your cock out at the lawyer's office.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,610
Like what if you were cool with paying 
your wife divorced money,

18
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:53,100
but you wanted to jerk off as you signed
the check.

19
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:58,101
Yeah.
Just to remind yourself of what a 

20
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:00,051
pathetic fucking full you are.
You get trapped in these terrible 

21
00:01:00,051 --> 00:01:03,381
relationships that you'd wind up being 
financially committed to these people 

22
00:01:03,381 --> 00:01:04,530
that you really never got along with 
ever for the rest of your fucking life.

23
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,650
And so as you're writing that down,
you just jerk off all over his desk.

24
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,010
I bet someone want to do it.
Can't do it,

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,040
but you can do it at home.
You can get divorced at home while 

26
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,440
jerking off.
No one can stop you.

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,670
You can,
um,

28
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:22,730
you can get a will for $69 bucks.
You can incorporate or form an LLC 

29
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:27,921
starting at 99 bucks and nine slash ll 
say once you're all so you can do 

30
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,610
whatever the fuck you want.

31
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:33,630
The environment no one can see you face 
is totally about community.

32
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,580
It's like that.
It's a limited liability company.

33
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,530
Limited liability.
It's interesting.

34
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,750
Probably should be illegal,
but uh,

35
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,560
if,
if,

36
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,030
if it exists,
you called it,

37
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,650
they're just like that and how we can 
come to us.

38
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,990
Yeah,
I'm legal.

39
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,110

You call the attorney and they calm

49
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,110
please calm down,
dude,

50
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:22,800
you're gonna be fine.

51
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,050
Here's how you do it.
Did $12,

52
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:26,200
million,
uh,

53
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,280
12 years rather over 2 million Americans
have used legal zoom.

54
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,160
That's um,
that's awesome.

55
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,550
So legal zoom,
go there and people use the codeword 

56
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:37,550
Rogan.
Yeah,

57
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:37,550
it's a lot of fucking people.
It's like,

58
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:42,260
it's,
it's annoying to have to go to a 

59
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:42,260
lawyer's office and do it on their time.
And you know what,

60
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:42,420
if you work,
we're down.

61
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:47,421
When I worked at a law firm,
they build my hours at 25 bucks an hour 

62
00:02:47,421 --> 00:02:51,200
to the clients.
When I did Xerox thing for 12 bucks an 

63
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,421
hour,
they made through legal zoom.com.

64
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,600
He was the codeword Rogan de de,
De,

65
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:58,970
De,
de.

66
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,040
We're also abroad.

67
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,310
You buy naturebox.
Naturebox is our latest sponsor.

68
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,290
They send you a delicious and nutritious
snacks.

69
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,760
They are better than sugar or heroin.
It's better than math for sure.

70
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,430
Yeah,
they're healthy.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,660
What?
Listen,

72
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,590
it's their snacks,
their carbohydrates.

73
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:25,591
You know,
there's like rice cakes that I had some 

74
00:03:25,591 --> 00:03:25,591
rice sticks.
They were good.

75
00:03:25,591 --> 00:03:25,591
They're delicious.
No Trans fats.

76
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,740
It's a lot more healthy than some shit 
that you're going to get out of a 

77
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,371
fucking vending machine and some of them
are really delicious Granola,

78
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,940
the salted caramel pretzel pumps.
Those are fucking really delicious.

79
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,110
Some of those that you have over there.
I got the harvest rice text way.

80
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,990
I'd have to try those for later.
Here's one important thing.

81
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:49,210
They have zero.
They have zero.

82
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,090
Excellent.
Zero high fructose corn syrup,

83
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,160
nothing artificial.
And the honey digital pretzels.

84
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,350
Very good too.
They're yummy.

85
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,790
Yup.
And uh,

86
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,020
it's,
it's better than,

87
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:04,021
you know,
people do give into temptation when you 

88
00:04:04,021 --> 00:04:06,691
don't have options when your only option
is that vending machine and his candy 

89
00:04:06,691 --> 00:04:10,771
bars in it,
you'd go with one of that and you feel 

90
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:10,771
like shit.

91
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:11,770
And this is a way to get snacks that 
are,

92
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,440
that are yummy and they're good for her.
Then they're just,

93
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,840
they're not total shit.
Like most of the stuff.

94
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,020
Cheetos and shit like that.
Not that those aren't awesome.

95
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,240
Pretty bad for you though.
Yup.

96
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,180
Not Good.
I lived next to a pink dot.

97
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,830
I just go down there when I got home.
I remember eating cheetos one time.

98
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,140
You and I went to pink dot and we were 
uh,

99
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,530
we were eating subs,
subs.

100
00:04:34,531 --> 00:04:38,230
He still have a look at that.
They still have that they do and they're

101
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:38,980
awful.
Well,

102
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:42,370
they were good at one point.
Some of them were good.

103
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,110
I had an Italian there that was pretty 
good.

104
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,670
But uh,
and I eat all these fucking cheetos.

105
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,810
I must've ate like a giant bag of 
cheetos and I felt so bad.

106
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,500
My body was like,
did you do that last?

107
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,470
A little bit of a mouth pleasure.

108
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:04,470
You fucking ruined the whole body for 
hours and hours during your whole body.

109
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:09,530
Just like leds.
This,

110
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,120
that you just shoved in the machine.
You asshole cheese puffs.

111
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,360
It says unlimited.
This is not the shit you're supposed to 

112
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,070
put in your own notebook.
My pleasure.

113
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,340
Well,
these are good for you and they're not 

114
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:26,340
going to give you that feeling.
Uh,

115
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,050
just healthy things like Granola,
a dark cocoa,

116
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:32,740
almonds which are delicious,
and a naturebox ships for free,

117
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,200
just like nature to us.
I don't know what they mean by that.

118
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:40,610
To try and try and try to understand 
what the fuck they mean ventures just 

119
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,360
for fruit.
Now you have to go to nature and pick it

120
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:44,480
up.
It doesn't to ship.

121
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,310
Live in nature.
Nature shifts or freeze.

122
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,110
If you're talking about pollen,
pollen is,

123
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,110
are there any products?
I'm box.

124
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,070
I don't think we sell poem.
I don't think you're selling

125
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,420
fallen over birds.
Yeah.

126
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:06,430
You guys got to get rid of that part.
Naturebox hips for phrase to say chips 

127
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,160
for free.
That means it doesn't mean anything.

128
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:08,540
Someone wrote it and they just 
shouldn't.

129
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,070
They should have said that.
That's ridiculous.

130
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,630
Next box,
they just forgot.

131
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,950
They probably just left it on there and 
no one said anything and it got passed a

132
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:19,100
bunch of people that weren't that 
stringent and they let it slide.

133
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,980
It doesn't ship for free son.
That shit's ridiculous.

134
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,150
Doesn't make any sense.
Nature's blocks were never on her.

135
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:26,630
Period.

136
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,560
What'd you say?
Nature's blocks when you were never on 

137
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,001
her period.
I don't even like box box box or be 

138
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:44,270
better than chips for free.
We're never on our period and now I got 

139
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:44,970
it.
I got pregnant.

140
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,190
Nature's box.
You can come in us.

141
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,690
Don't worry about it.
Shoot one in their junk box.

142
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,700
Don't worry about naturebox.

Hey Shit.
Went in there.

152
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,900
That's not herpes.
That's lemon tea post.

153
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,210
Don't worry about it bitch.
Walk it off.

154
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,670
Walk it off at naturebox.
Were also brought to you by on it.com,

155
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:46,700
o n n I t if you haven't been to on it.
And while we've added a lot of things,

156
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:50,110
continue to add things that,
uh,

157
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,650
mostly just things that we find that are
beneficial.

158
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:58,130
Uh,
the idea of on it is a human 

159
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,650
optimization website.
What that means is we sell strength and 

160
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,880
conditioning equipment and supplements 
and protein powder,

161
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:07,881
hemp protein powder,
but just sell things that we find that 

162
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:07,881
we find that are beneficial.
Um,

163
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:11,220
these kettlebells that we have made,
we have a artistic talent kettlebells to

164
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:16,250
the Zombie bells and the primal bells 
and what they are is kettlebells that 

165
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:16,320
looked bad ass.

166
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,790
They look like their sculptures.
They're made by this kid,

167
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,250
Steven,
this kid,

168
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,200
these young kids these days with her 
artistic talent.

169
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:29,210
Man,
he might not be a kid on he didn't know 

170
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:29,210
his name his age.
Uh,

171
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,580
Steven Shubin Jr.
He created the primal belt.

172
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:32,340
YeaH,
the monkey one and apes.

173
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,490
And then he also did the new ones which 
are zombie bells.

174
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,520
They're all balanced out because one of 
the things about a kettle bells is it's 

175
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,901
all about swinging this ball.
There's heavy steel ball and it's all 

176
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:48,570
about balancing it and controlling it.
And if the ball was off,

177
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,730
like with these faces,
it could easily be off.

178
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,940
So we had them.
A part of the artwork is that they had 

179
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,361
to be three d to make sure that they 
still are a kettlebells that you can 

180
00:08:59,361 --> 00:09:03,741
train with with no problems.
I train with mY guerrilla all the time 

181
00:09:03,741 --> 00:09:04,080
and it's,
you can work out with it just like a rug

182
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:04,590
or kettlebell.

183
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,620
You just have to be cognizant of where 
the head is facing,

184
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:09,780
but you should know that anyway and 
you'd be fine.

185
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:15,290
But I trained with them my favorite all 
time exercise for strength and 

186
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:20,481
conditioning.
And I don't even mean if you're an 

187
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:20,481
athlete,
if you're an athlete,

188
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:20,481
they're fantastic.
I mean,

189
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:25,370
they're really great for also for 
educating your body to work as one unit.

190
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,670
you know,
carrying a heavy,

191
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
heavy kettle bell into and things like 
cleans and presses and things along 

192
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,000
those lines.
Um,

193
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,680
but it's Also,
they're great for regular life.

194
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:37,740
They are great for just being able to 
pick up a couch and help move it.

195
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:42,741
They're great for.
It's better to have a body that works a 

196
00:09:42,741 --> 00:09:44,841
little better.
A body that can be strong body that it 

197
00:09:44,841 --> 00:09:44,850
doesn't break when you try to bring home
groceries,

198
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,160
get your shit together,
bitch.

199
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,270
That's what I'm trying to say.

200
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,780
I like that.
That little bitch at goblins,

201
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:56,781
not even his army.
The little one is a goblins over there 

202
00:09:56,781 --> 00:09:57,370
saying brian brains.
Obgyn gardens.

203
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:03,270
Brain zombieland bring goblin.
I think it's a.

204
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,620
I think that's still a zombie dude.
It goblins zombie,

205
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,170
but I shouldn't have.
They should have one that's shaped like,

206
00:10:11,171 --> 00:10:13,140
it looks like a pretty girl going to 
work.

207
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:13,660
Yeah.
It's.

208
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,960
I mean this doesn't look like it goes 
face thrilling.

209
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,170
Like funny name but doesn't look like a 
zombie to you.

210
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,150
That looks like a zombie.
That doesn't quite get ghost.

211
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,370
No.
No ghost ghost there.

212
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,480
That's solid mass.
Yeah.

213
00:10:24,481 --> 00:10:26,490
That's mad.
You can't see through that shit.

214
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,970
You know,
it's frankenstein and ship anything.

215
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,280
Yeah.
Yeah.

216
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,840
That's a zombie dude gobble.
Oh wait.

217
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,050
Zombies are the ones that know that.
Yeah.

218
00:10:37,051 --> 00:10:39,080
It's definitely not a ghost.
Yeah.

219
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,540
Well,
can't go look like anything who can say 

220
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,810
you can see through it goes,
you know what's fucked up man?

221
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,210
It's really fucked up what they've done 
with vampires.

222
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,320
What do you mean they've given new rules
to like vampires?

223
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:57,380
Oh really?
You can go out in the sun as long as 

224
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:57,380
seattle.
Well,

225
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:57,380
two people did it.
It happened twice.

226
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,840
Once it happened with blade,
which I forgave.

227
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,560
It was.
Why was he a day walker?

228
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,080
He's half vampire.
He was born,

229
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:07,600
his mom.

230
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:12,700
He was born and he became half vampire.
Not like totally vampires,

231
00:11:12,701 --> 00:11:15,010
some weird sort of hybrid thing.
But uh,

232
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,420
so stephen dorff was the main vampire 
tooth and

233
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,350
could go outside with sunscreen.
Oh really?

234
00:11:21,351 --> 00:11:23,810
Yes.
Ridiculous.

235
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,970
That's the worst.
No you can't.

236
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,010
No,
you better have magic or something.

237
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,460
He can't just fucking put sunscreen on.
You're a vampire man.

238
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,770
You,
you burn instantly.

239
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Hey,
we wrote this when he's outside during 

240
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,160
the day,
like we'll figure it out.

241
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,090
Writer.
I don't remember that from the comic 

242
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:43,220
book either because blade was a favorite
comic book of mine.

243
00:11:43,221 --> 00:11:45,740
I was always a big comic book fan.
I love blade.

244
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,830
I don't even remember as a comic book.
Oh,

245
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,840
he was awesome.
He would fight fucking fight vampires 

246
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:52,840
and shed.
He used to teach knife in those,

247
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,160
uh,
those books.

248
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,750
It was cool when he showed up at that 
party,

249
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,200
it was cool to look.
Man I know was supposed to fight that 

250
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,330
guy.
But I'm a wesley snipes fan.

251
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,810
I think he was awesome.
He's in prison now.

252
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:06,820
He's out now.
He's back doing movies again.

253
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,490
He,
uh,

254
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,260
he was awesome in blade.
Yeah.

255
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:15,261
Apparently he was completely craZy by 
the time blade to I guess come rogan use

256
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:16,890
a codeword rogan.
This is,

257
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,420
we're obviously doing a podcast when 
fuck the music man.

258
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,830
Our experience here,
we don't have to do this.

259
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:27,530
The um,
by the time he was doing like blade two 

260
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,030
or three,
apparently he was off the handle.

261
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:32,350
PaTton oswald has wrote a whole blog 
entry about it on meeting.

262
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,520
I'm describing it,
describing,

263
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,030
uh,
he might've performed it somewhere.

264
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,270
He,
he might have performed it,

265
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,650
I'm not sure,
but we're hearing about it.

266
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,580
I thought,
holy shit.

267
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,160
It was crazy.
It was like Ryan O'neal and him.

268
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:48,020
And apparently this was.
Wesley was like,

269
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,620
he was gone.
He was,

270
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,760
you know,
just off the deep end,

271
00:12:51,761 --> 00:12:56,761
crazy on the set.
And so they replaced him with what 

272
00:12:56,761 --> 00:12:58,270
patent called much cooler black guys.
They replaced him with another guy,

273
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,550
did the martial arts stuff and yeah,
because I couldn't deal with them.

274
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,550
I don't know.
I don't know what the fuck happened.

275
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,180
Why wasn't he already sort of a movie 
star?

276
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:13,150
He went crazy in between there and there
are probably some substances were 

277
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,570
involved.
It's always that.

278
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,240
It's usually,
it's always that.

279
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah.
Then you see them like taken whatever.

280
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:19,370
You're like,
oh,

281
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,190
oh,
oh.

282
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,220
It's also,
I don't think we can imagine what it's 

283
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,670
like to be that famous.
I think for some people it's just.

284
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:32,790
And then you get hooked up with the 
wrong people in your life and you're 

285
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,040
fucking around with the wrong friends 
and getting in trouble.

286
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,430
So many of them.
Elvis.

287
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,640
Yeah,
it's,

288
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,200
it's,
it's a well,

289
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,220
the nature of the business,
like if you're a fucking person who's in

290
00:13:45,221 --> 00:13:50,221
the limelight that heavily,
like the nature of the business becomes 

291
00:13:50,221 --> 00:13:51,250
very bizarre.
You know the nature of your reality.

292
00:13:51,251 --> 00:13:52,930
You're getting around.
Everyone treats me like a,

293
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,310
like a,
like a commodity.

294
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,600
What we were talking about justin 
bieber,

295
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,510
like how justin bieber,
the kids everywhere he goes,

296
00:13:58,511 --> 00:14:00,520
people fucking freak out just to see 
him.

297
00:14:00,521 --> 00:14:01,080
Like,
oh,

298
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,890
he's like,
it's some weird alien.

299
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:03,550
You know,
we,

300
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:07,750
we can't imagine what the forum now sort
of in a way.

301
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,460
I mean,
it's not an ideal way to live.

302
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,620
It seems awesome.
Like don't feel bad.

303
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:14,560
He's got all this money,
but know it's so crazy,

304
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:19,590
like burden to throw on some bread.
Totally told me he got into an elevator 

305
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:23,011
with Jessica Simpson and she,
she turns to the woman who's with us 

306
00:14:23,011 --> 00:14:23,011
because he's not supposed to be in here.

307
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,070
Human.
Yeah.

308
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,790
It was just going up through whatever 
his room and he was in no way.

309
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,520
Oh my god.
Yeah.

310
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,860
Well,
you know what though?

311
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,920
How do you start expecting that?
It is totally wrong,

312
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:40,921
but in her defense,
to be her as a woman and be super duper 

313
00:14:41,411 --> 00:14:44,770
super famous,
she must be so vulnerable.

314
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,150
IT must be weird to the opportunity to.
For a guy to get in an elevator with her

315
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,340
like men want.
She's not used to it so much.

316
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:57,341
There's so many men who like and a guy 
who knows that he could probably 

317
00:14:57,341 --> 00:15:01,691
physically take advantage of her and 
can't believe that he's in her presence 

318
00:15:01,691 --> 00:15:03,130
and attract environment,
like an elevator really creep.

319
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,390
He would go to town.
He could.

320
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,490
Who would ravage her?
Be horrible.

321
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:11,210
I mean now you're much more vulnerable 
as a woman if you're that super famous.

322
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,090
If you think she puts in a writer when 
she goes to a hotel is like,

323
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:15,350
okay,
but you got to let him know,

324
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,400
no one can ride with me.

325
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,530
No,
you can't do that.

326
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,580
She might have rules at her security 
follows security,

327
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:28,060
security.
She might have rules like she doesn't 

328
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,061
want security to let anybody in the 
hotel lobby with her won't let anybody 

329
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:31,890
in the elevator with.
I don't know.

330
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:37,150
she might,
but it's like people don't have to 

331
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,911
listen to that normal after that.
No one's allowed to be in the elevator 

332
00:15:39,911 --> 00:15:39,911
with you.
Well,

333
00:15:39,911 --> 00:15:44,021
here's the thing about like you and I is
that we're were standup comedians and by

334
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:49,091
being a stand up comedian,
you're all the time forced to look at 

335
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:49,091
everything,
interrupt you,

336
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:51,230
looked at yourself,
you look at yourself,

337
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:53,930
you look at like what you're saying.
You look at the world around you,

338
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,040
you're looking for jokes and things.
You look for jokes and yourself.

339
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,520
You look at for jokes in your own life.
A lot of people don't do that ever,

340
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,270
so they're not thinking ever thinking 
about their behavior.

341
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:09,560
They just doing what they can get away 
with and they're acting is fucking loony

342
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:14,561
tunes often as they can get away with it
is as they continue to get away with 

343
00:16:14,561 --> 00:16:16,160
more and more looney tune shit or got 
worse and worse,

344
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,920
but that's what the whole diva thing is 
all about.

345
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:19,310
Man,
I mean,

346
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,700
she has so much power to yell and scream
at people like,

347
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,900
why?
Why do you,

348
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,390
why is that?
What's going on there?

349
00:16:24,391 --> 00:16:25,060
I said,
rosetta,

350
00:16:25,061 --> 00:16:26,870
every year,
every year she got,

351
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:29,130
she had our show.
There's just fired more show runners.

352
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,450
She was on the podcast talking about it.
Really?

353
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,130
Yeah.
it's just like talking to people.

354
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,870
When she talked about how crazy she 
went.

355
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,490
Really?
Yeah.

356
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,470
Yeah.
She's pretty open about it,

357
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,360
you know?
I mean,

358
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,380
she's essentially saying what you're 
saying.

359
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:46,160
She's sAying that nobody can handle it.
It's too after another.

360
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,200
They all fall.
It's too hard to be,

361
00:16:48,201 --> 00:16:50,060
but there's no way.
No way.

362
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,280
There's no way.
Yeah.

363
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:58,260
I've been trying to rush people.
You're scrawny so young too,

364
00:16:58,971 --> 00:17:01,640
you know,
for him to be so young and that habit to

365
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:03,530
them,
it's fucking wild ride,

366
00:17:03,531 --> 00:17:05,540
man.
That's not a normal ride of life.

367
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,390
You're not a man yet.
You're a child and you're adored.

368
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,010
That's not supposed to happen that way.
You're supposed to feel insecure and see

369
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:14,540
how they become the joffrey.
Oh yeah,

370
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,040
exactly.
Exactly.

371
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:16,850
Exactly.
I mean,

372
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:18,950
he's raised in that.
I'm sure he's not.

373
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,830
I'm sure a lot of it is exaggerated.
He seems like a nice kid.

374
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:23,480
I met him once.
I shook his hand.

375
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:25,880
Is dancing in the ufc.
Yeah,

376
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:27,320
I mean it seems like a nice treat.
Trump tremble.

377
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:28,360
what do I know?
I didn't know.

378
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:34,140
I didn't know.
It wasn't until I was shaking his hand 

379
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:34,140
like as I was shaking his hand,
I was like,

380
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:34,640
I was saying her kid,
this was a while ago,

381
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:37,460
but he's much more famous now than even 
he was then.

382
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:42,490
Oh,
I keys like in some crazy stratosphere 

383
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:45,041
of fame thing now,
but I think we like jesus.

384
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:45,910
No,
no,

385
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,520
no,
no,

386
00:17:46,521 --> 00:17:47,840
no.
He was just a nice kid.

387
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:52,841
Just came over and I realized as I was 
shaking his hand that it was justin 

388
00:17:52,841 --> 00:17:56,211
bieber,
but just said this was like two years 

389
00:17:56,211 --> 00:17:56,211
ago.
Probably two,

390
00:17:56,211 --> 00:17:57,030
maybe might even be three,
but nice.

391
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,990
You know,
it's nice as an all well and good,

392
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:04,350
but idiot man.
Being able to handle that kind of fame.

393
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,040
I couldn't imagine how anybody could not
elvis it.

394
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,660
Peggy,
there's no way.

395
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,180
It seems like there's no way.
It seems like your,

396
00:18:13,181 --> 00:18:15,420
your reality.
Just so bizarre.

397
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,350
Yeah.
If you are just entitled to something,

398
00:18:18,351 --> 00:18:19,010
you were just like,
alright,

399
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,050
I'll take it.
Yeah.

400
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,030
Do you think they're just picking on him
to a point where like,

401
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:28,060
I mean they're like making new stories 
of him peeing in a mop bucket and 

402
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,060
they're,
they're,

403
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:32,800
they're making new stories of him being 
a 21 year old egging his neighbor's 

404
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,770
house.
Oh no,

405
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:34,280
no,
no,

406
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,650
but it iS real.
But I mean when I was 21,

407
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,880
right.
That's what we all did.

408
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:38,480
We all did.

409
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,360
But a 21 year old that's got 
$500,000,000

410
00:18:43,361 --> 00:18:44,300
or whatever it is.
God,

411
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,760
that becomes more interesting when they 
get mad at them in a bucket.

412
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:53,140
You got thAt much money.
He's got to pee in the house.

413
00:18:53,141 --> 00:18:54,190
The egging,
the house thing.

414
00:18:54,191 --> 00:18:59,191
I kind of disagree.
I don't think there's anything wrong 

415
00:18:59,191 --> 00:18:59,191
with that.
Yeah.

416
00:18:59,191 --> 00:19:00,460
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with that being a story.

417
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:02,140
I think that's a real important story.

418
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:02,930
Yeah,
I agree.

419
00:19:02,931 --> 00:19:05,900
But he got caught,
but it's like that is.

420
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,660
But like all these other things are just
like,

421
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:09,950
well,
yeah,

422
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,780
you're 19 and slutting it up.
Yeah.

423
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,790
You're from the south,
of course.

424
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:19,540
That's perfect on on target.
I bet you if you were hanging out with 

425
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:23,891
him,
it would be just like hanging out with 

426
00:19:23,891 --> 00:19:23,891
your friends.
Oh,

427
00:19:23,891 --> 00:19:23,891
you want to smoke weed?
Oh dude,

428
00:19:23,891 --> 00:19:24,320
let's get a little faster than the car.
Oh,

429
00:19:24,321 --> 00:19:29,321
let's do this.
And then you have all those things that 

430
00:19:29,321 --> 00:19:32,561
you've did.
they've made stories out of all these 

431
00:19:32,561 --> 00:19:32,561
little minor details and made it like 
every time you go on tmz,

432
00:19:32,561 --> 00:19:34,730
it's something stupid.
Like bieber did this,

433
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,860
he flicked off.
There was smoke coming out of his

434
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,730
carly.
He becomes the show.

435
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:43,731
See the problem is like when,
when you step out like that and you 

436
00:19:43,731 --> 00:19:47,541
drive in a chrome car and he's.
What he's doing is he's stepping out,

437
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:53,601
he's racing lamborghinis and miami and 
he's getting fucked up here and he's 

438
00:19:53,601 --> 00:19:54,510
getting fucked up there and he's having 
fun.

439
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,940
He's having a great time.
I bet he's having a great time.

440
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,120
he's doing the best I've ever imagined.
A 19 year old kid could do with a half a

441
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,800
billion dollars.
He's doing great.

442
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,110
Like leave him alone.
His dad's around them all the time.

443
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:10,580
Right.
I don't know what story,

444
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,650
I'm just trying to make good music,
dude.

445
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:17,680
What the fuck should I do?
He's having a blast is what has 

446
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:17,680
happened.
But boy,

447
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,890
he's on a crazy rocket ship ride.
There's no way he's strapped to the,

448
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:26,580
to the head of like a missile and shot 
through the sky and it's like,

449
00:20:26,581 --> 00:20:27,930
wow.
The fucking,

450
00:20:27,931 --> 00:20:32,931
you know,
the ride fast and very exciting.

451
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:38,750
But the lending,
what is the lending going to be like 

452
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,950
them out like a,
like a virgin anymore.

453
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,570
Well,
how are you going to keep this?

454
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,370
I mean,
how long are you going to keep balling?

455
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,100
how long can you keep balling that hard?
It's

456
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,890
got a chrome car.
He's 19.

457
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:53,740
He's going to throw an exit.
Is fucking neighbors house.

458
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,580
Shirley temple retired at 21.
Whoa.

459
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,570
She was like,
I'm getting out of the business.

460
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,280
living off residuals.
Whoa.

461
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,950
She lived a normal life.
Wow.

462
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,340
That's crazy.
Yeah,

463
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,310
I feel like 10 years.
Nobody even fucking bother.

464
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,290
Wow.
Huh?

465
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,070
That might be the move.
Just like,

466
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:12,880
cool.
I get it now.

467
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:14,140
I'm good.
I'm set on this.

468
00:21:14,141 --> 00:21:14,860
Let me just,
uh,

469
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,630
working on my painting.
I don't know,

470
00:21:16,631 --> 00:21:17,260
man,
you know,

471
00:21:17,261 --> 00:21:22,261
as,
as you see more and more instances of 

472
00:21:22,261 --> 00:21:24,670
people that get that super stratosphere 
fame and more and more.

473
00:21:24,671 --> 00:21:26,470
Michael jackson's,
you know,

474
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:31,830
Michael Jackson to me is the most 
fascinating character study on human 

475
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:36,940
beings that I've ever witnessed because 
I think he is.

476
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:42,030
He never went down and faint.
Well I guess sort of he kind of did it 

477
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:42,030
and then didn't.

478
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:46,540
Then we started sort of still in the mix
because people didn't want to believe 

479
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:46,750
that he was a child molester.
Nobody wanted to believe it.

480
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,280
Dude,
that guy,

481
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:53,940
it became a fucking freak.
He became a monster.

482
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:57,970
He became a monster monster.
He became a monitor into a monster.

483
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
He became this white skinned vampire 
like guy with alien eyes pick nose.

484
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,410
He had his.
Yeah,

485
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:10,560
he had his eyes worked on to the point 
where his eyes were like really big and 

486
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,640
why it was weird.
He had a bunch of weird shit done to his

487
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:14,490
face.
He had a temple,

488
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,860
put it in,
play the superbowl,

489
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,150
and he denied ever having anything done.
Yes,

490
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,270
yes,
yes.

491
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,890
He denied having anything done like went
to have my nose fixed,

492
00:22:26,891 --> 00:22:31,891
but that was because something went 
wrong and then he pretended to have a 

493
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:31,891
baby with somebody.
Yeah.

494
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:31,891
What was that?

495
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:36,850
And the kids came out white with one 
with one with elvis's daughter to live 

496
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:37,950
baby with her.
Well,

497
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:38,260
no,
no,

498
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,880
no.
He didn't have a baby with her,

499
00:22:39,881 --> 00:22:44,881
but uh,
he had with this one woman supposedly 

500
00:22:44,881 --> 00:22:46,840
she was pregnant with his kids and the 
kids came out totally white.

501
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:48,190
Totally white.
Completely white.

502
00:22:48,191 --> 00:22:50,950
Like it's one of the weirdest things 
ever and I guess you're supposed to do.

503
00:22:50,951 --> 00:22:52,990
I don't know what you're supposed to 
question and believe in him.

504
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:58,590
I don't know the guy.
Do you remember when he was going 

505
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:58,870
through that?
When he's doing the interview in vegas?

506
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,630
There's going through that.
Like store?

507
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,500
Yes.
It was like,

508
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,790
totally,
you know,

509
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,800
the famous pretty nice.
I'll have to have those plays and this 

510
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,060
guy behind there's lyric just like,
all right,

511
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,960
that's $200,000
was $150,000

512
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:12,820
each.
There's a toweling it up.

513
00:23:12,821 --> 00:23:13,510
You just keep going.

514
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,770
Yeah.
Doing the interviewing.

515
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,270
Yeah.
Ordering shit.

516
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:19,150
Just walKing through,
it was kind of like a cry for help,

517
00:23:19,151 --> 00:23:20,320
man.
Sort of.

518
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,660
that video was kind of like a cry for 
help.

519
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:27,750
What did that kid say?
This is that guy that's saying that 

520
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,600
Michael Jackson molested him when he was
a kid and now he's like trying to get 

521
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,910
money out of this state state saying you
waited too long to add,

522
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,190
so it's not as funny anymore.
It's our money.

523
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,490
What do you think though,
man?

524
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:41,491
You know,
there's also the possibility that he 

525
00:23:41,491 --> 00:23:43,351
didn't molest kids or he.
There's nothing I know about the world 

526
00:23:43,351 --> 00:23:44,620
that would say that that's a realistic 
possibility,

527
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,780
but yeah,
it was.

528
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,400
Could it be that people were trYing to 
take advantage of a guy that's just 

529
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:51,400
fucking really weird?
Yeah.

530
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,301
Maybe that's the only way people aren't 
like at his door with pitchforks is as a

531
00:23:56,361 --> 00:23:59,770
possibility while he's dead it a door 
today.

532
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:00,350
No,
no,

533
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:02,540
no.
He died the weirdest death.

534
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,710
However.
Yeah.

535
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:08,450
the guy who's taking this with me 
getting put under every night and that's

536
00:24:08,451 --> 00:24:10,410
how he's going to send someone to jail.
Yeah.

537
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,880
Yeah.
You imagine humanity,

538
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,240
you take it to the next level of sleep,
you're getting fms,

539
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:21,680
the tie to yourself to be okay.
How about sleeping pills?

540
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:25,370
So that's telling to fit in like a 
nightmare.

541
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,500
Well,
uh,

542
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:29,750
I just think if we just let michael,
if you just lay your head down,

543
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:35,020
just count sheep for a little bit of.
Well that's tells me you're not 

544
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,500
listening to me.
Try it without the stuff.

545
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,820
Yeah.
He wasn't willing.

546
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,830
He wasn't even willing to endure that.
Nope.

547
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,960
Nope.
We're not going to be staying up another

548
00:24:41,961 --> 00:24:45,830
night.
Ties me and their doctor was so crazy.

549
00:24:45,831 --> 00:24:50,831
He just did it.
He was getting paid so much fucking 

550
00:24:50,831 --> 00:24:52,060
every night,
but it was,

551
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:57,310
I guess that's super bad for you.
I guess you're not supposed to ask.

552
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,430
It seems like that would be a no 
brainer.

553
00:25:04,431 --> 00:25:07,030
Like do you sleep?
Yeah.

554
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:11,900
So not really.
I wake up more refreshed.

555
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,020
Moistened had a side effect of that 
particular type of anesthesia is like,

556
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,320
no,
no,

557
00:25:18,321 --> 00:25:21,170
you,
you wake up and you feel refreshed.

558
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,300
It's like there's some sort of a trick 
to it.

559
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:24,730
Oh really?
I'll have to like 30 minutes.

560
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,830
I kind of remember reading that I should
probably pull it up.

561
00:25:27,831 --> 00:25:32,831
I think there was a particular type of 
anesthesia that he was eddie bravo's 

562
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,280
class.
I felt so refreshed afterwards.

563
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,400
That's different.
Yeah.

564
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,090
You wake up and I was like,
when he was like,

565
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:38,800
yeah,
you can get back in there.

566
00:25:38,801 --> 00:25:39,290
I was like,
kennedy.

567
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,530
Really?
I just felt like I felt like rusted.

568
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:45,740
I felt like a nap for 30 minutes.
So is anesthesia.

569
00:25:45,741 --> 00:25:49,040
Do you guys remember what it was called?
What do you mean?

570
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:54,100
the type of game of war?
The anesthesia that they got him with a 

571
00:25:55,671 --> 00:25:57,930
pro bowl fall.
Oh yeah.

572
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,180
Propafol purple fox who was sort of a 
pro falls benefits per pole.

573
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:08,590
Fall full joint.
Even once I can't go to sleep.

574
00:26:10,911 --> 00:26:12,360
What else you got?
That's,

575
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:18,660
but I haven't been.
We've got to go to the idea that someone

576
00:26:19,071 --> 00:26:24,071
could get that far gone to get that far 
gone where they just need to be put out 

577
00:26:24,071 --> 00:26:24,980
to other doctors were like,
michael,

578
00:26:24,981 --> 00:26:28,410
I can't do that.
Like get the fuck outta here with dr.

579
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,180
Was like,
all right,

580
00:26:29,181 --> 00:26:30,900
I guess I'll do it.
I guess this dr.

581
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:34,040
Thought he was going to be able to keep 
them alive and if he kept him alive,

582
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:37,220
he would be still pulling money out of 
michael for a long time.

583
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:42,460
I mean,
that's the only reason why it makes any 

584
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,641
sense that anybody would agree to do 
this is because need money or they want 

585
00:26:45,641 --> 00:26:45,800
the money.
It's so.

586
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,030
I mean,
there's a reason why it's not legal.

587
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,250
It's not ethical.
It's scary.

588
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,300
It's scary that you can get a doctor to 
agree to just put you under every night.

589
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:59,380
It's so crazy.
Oh,

590
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,860
I'm trying to find the disadvantages.
Ended up going to sleep every night.

591
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,950
I might buy the gas.
Yeah.

592
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,400
I'm,
I'm just the disadvantages of,

593
00:27:10,401 --> 00:27:11,550
uh,
of using it.

594
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:15,870
Let me hear him just a.
By the way,

595
00:27:15,871 --> 00:27:18,030
I'll be in chicago at zanies this 
weekend.

596
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,850
I'm want to want to know more powerful 
chicago.

597
00:27:20,851 --> 00:27:22,020
Zany,
small club.

598
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,220
Cool place.
Yeah.

599
00:27:23,221 --> 00:27:25,770
there had been supposed to be one of the
best clubs In the country.

600
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:30,860
I've never been in there really good.
I was supposed to be one of those small 

601
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:30,860
ones,
right?

602
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:30,860
Yeah.
It's a real small.

603
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,880
I think it's like less than 200 seats.
I think it's jammed though.

604
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,200
I joined three shows on saturday,
two shows on sunday.

605
00:27:35,201 --> 00:27:37,240
I love it.
I love chicago.

606
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,710
Chicago's cool.
But the best.

607
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,020
There's something fantastic about that 
town.

608
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,870
I mean this is a mess right now as far 
as crimes,

609
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:50,871
especially with young urban kids like 
the gang warfare,

610
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:51,970
that chicago.

611
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:57,020
Horrible,
horrible gang fighting and murders a 

612
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:57,230
lot.
A lot of that going on.

613
00:27:57,231 --> 00:27:59,010
Some pleasant.
Yeah.

614
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,200
Yeah.
There's a lot of that shit going on.

615
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:06,630
It's a,
it's kind of one of the highest murder 

616
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:06,630
rates in the country.
Really?

617
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:06,990
Oh yeah.
When I was there,

618
00:28:06,991 --> 00:28:09,500
I barely ever played there.
He never played there.

619
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,120
I barely ever do it with me just to do 
with the theater fucking might ask you.

620
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,920
That was like a week ago.
I forgot how it will be.

621
00:28:19,921 --> 00:28:24,921
All different material if you'd come out
there and I'm not going to appear of 

622
00:28:24,921 --> 00:28:24,921
that stuff.
Um,

623
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,860
there is,
um,

624
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,630
there's a type of person that comes from
the midwest.

625
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:36,030
They're like,
they're like grounded and you went in 

626
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:36,030
the store.
Yeah.

627
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:36,030
This is sort of a genuine grounded 
quality,

628
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:41,000
like a lot of hard work and people,
a lot of people that have worked on 

629
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,841
farms,
a lot of people that have families that 

630
00:28:44,841 --> 00:28:44,841
worked on the farm.

631
00:28:44,841 --> 00:28:47,870
People that came over here,
their relatives came over here a long 

632
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:50,391
ass time ago.
You know what I saw there once though I 

633
00:28:50,391 --> 00:28:52,611
saw it was one of the early days.
I went there with you and there was 

634
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:54,150
this.
They put us into like a vip area,

635
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,240
those night clubs and some girl was 
flirting and then she came in and sat 

636
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:00,540
with us.
I was like,

637
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,110
yeah,
sure,

638
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,830
come on in,
and then as soon as she went in,

639
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,200
some girl behind the rope bumped her.
She just gave her this look like,

640
00:29:07,201 --> 00:29:09,240
excuse me,
you need to keep out of here.

641
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,690
This isn't my area right now.
She just took it over.

642
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:16,620
Was she kicked a girl out of.
It was so confused.

643
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:19,650
She just got invited to some vip area 
that immediately started acting like she

644
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:22,700
was better than everyone else.
So the first time I saw that behavior,

645
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,270
oh,
I see where your shoes.

646
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,650
Somehow the queen,
all of a sudden,

647
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,600
yeah,
people can be county.

648
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:32,750
That's not good.
I definitely explained that the least.

649
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:38,280
You might be too hard to talk right now.
My tolerance went down in New York.

650
00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:39,840
My most slow your roll.
Yeah.

651
00:29:39,841 --> 00:29:41,150
The New York thing is a bummer.
Huh?

652
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:46,960
So it's such a horrible way to live.
They for folks who don't know.

653
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,620
Alright.
I mean I'm not saying this like a.

654
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:52,030
This is the way you have to live.
I'm just letting you know,

655
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,600
in los angeles it is unbelievably 
ridiculously easy to procure a marijuana

656
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:00,880
just pulled over.
it's essentially legal.

657
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,220
It's essentially legal.
Yeah.

658
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,630
Um,
if you have a medical license,

659
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:06,670
it's legal.
If you have a medical license,

660
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,550
if you don't have a medical license,
it's decriminalized.

661
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:10,780
So,
uh,

662
00:30:10,781 --> 00:30:13,210
that's one of the things that arnold did
when he left office.

663
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:17,320
So As long as you're not smoking weed 
and drIving like an asshole,

664
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,630
it's,
it's pretty fucking legal.

665
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:24,850
You do it,
you're doing it in the privacy of your 

666
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:24,850
own home.
So I'll give a shit.

667
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,470
They don't give a shit in my window 
giving me a lecture about texting with a

668
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:28,060
half smoke bowl,
like in the middle,

669
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,070
leaning in for like two minutes.

670
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,840
They don't care then.
Okay.

671
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,060
They know what people are concerned 
with.

672
00:30:34,061 --> 00:30:39,061
Especially police officers.
There's people that are fucking 

673
00:30:39,061 --> 00:30:39,061
dangerous.
Yes.

674
00:30:39,061 --> 00:30:39,130
They're concerned with.
If you see a guy texting,

675
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:41,110
that's dangerous.
You know if you.

676
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,290
If you see a guy in his van looks like 
cheech and chong,

677
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:46,510
that guy's probably drove really fucking
slow.

678
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:51,220
As this smoke leaves is cracked window,
that guy is going to be a.

679
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,230
He's probably going to be really scared 
of merge,

680
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,190
but other than that in Maryland I 
couldn't figure out.

681
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,620
Even with my friend,
we're wanting to smoke pot,

682
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,920
but we couldn't do it at each other's 
parents' house.

683
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,930
Just got in the car.
No other options,

684
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,010
but then you carson.
I was like,

685
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:04,240
wait,
that's the problem.

686
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:09,300
If you've got to make that choice,
you make that choice to smoke in your 

687
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:09,300
car.
Your car is always going to smell like.

688
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:09,330
Wait,
no,

689
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,260
just for like 10 minutes.
Bullshit shit.

690
00:31:11,261 --> 00:31:13,930
Unless you've closed doors right?
When you finished smoking pot,

691
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:18,940
smoking dogs come there a month later.
He smells like weed,

692
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,170
a weed in my car on the way to the 
airport.

693
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,200
This time that was in there,
like in the center console for maybe a 

694
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:28,200
year or two.
I was just.

695
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,010
I didn't try it yet.
I was on the way to the airport.

696
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,370
I always wonder if I know edibles lose 
their potency.

697
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,630
They do.
Yeah.

698
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:37,210
They go away.
It goes away like almost entirely.

699
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:42,230
It gets to the point where they don't do
anything but they only have like a 

700
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,780
certain time.
Mccormick explained it to me once.

701
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:48,830
I don't remember if tony,
somebody that was in the back of my 

702
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:48,830
fridge for like three years.
Once you want it,

703
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,720
you can have it and how they and he was 
like,

704
00:31:50,721 --> 00:31:51,430
I'm high as fuck.

705
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,970
Wow.
Well I guess maybe the dried plants,

706
00:31:55,150 --> 00:32:00,150
it's different than when you cook it.
It's like the cooking aspect of it I 

707
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,860
think,
or the edible form.

708
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:08,130
Something about like top off too long 
doesn't really like of what if like 

709
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,550
let's say you have a thing of like that.
The red sauce,

710
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,910
not the structural cells,
but the ones with all the seeds in them.

711
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,200
You ever see those?
Oh,

712
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,520
okay.
Yeah,

713
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:19,960
I know what you're talking about on top 
off that.

714
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:25,290
Just let it like oxygenate it goes away.
No,

715
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,710
no.
It's just observation.

716
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,620
Really?
Yeah.

717
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,230
Hm.
That's interesting.

718
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:34,350
I don't know.
You're the one that turned me onto that 

719
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:34,350
fucking shit.
What is that stuff that you gave me that

720
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,140
bombs to bomb.
Oh,

721
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,360
so good.
Oh my god.

722
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:42,780
He gave me this hot sauce that it looks 
like if you were like,

723
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:47,860
uh,
it even has like a nuclear warning sign 

724
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,621
on it,
like a little nuclear sign on it and 

725
00:32:50,621 --> 00:32:50,621
it's such a small bottle.

726
00:32:50,621 --> 00:32:51,270
You're like,
what did what,

727
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,050
what?
How horrific could this stuff possible?

728
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:00,380
It's such a small bottle,
like how are they so confident is 

729
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,030
telling me that much hot sauce.
Is it just that one pepper that whatever

730
00:33:02,031 --> 00:33:04,880
the ghost pepper pepper.
I don't know if it's ghost pepper.

731
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,920
It might be that casts become capsaicin.
Capsaicin.

732
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:09,740
yeah.
Well,

733
00:33:09,741 --> 00:33:11,880
let's find out.
See the bomb d,

734
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:18,020
the habanero peppers.
That's it.

735
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,190
No,
that's not it.

736
00:33:19,191 --> 00:33:21,860
That's a different one.
There's a death one,

737
00:33:21,861 --> 00:33:25,310
the black one.
There's this little tiny death one,

738
00:33:25,311 --> 00:33:27,860
whatever.
The little tiny death one is that one to

739
00:33:27,861 --> 00:33:29,450
finally answer.
What is that?

740
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:32,930
Is it bob dropping in the middle of zed 
it,

741
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,220
but literally three drops a plate of 
spaghetti and marinara sauce.

742
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,960
Three drops.
Then mix up the whole thing.

743
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,300
Is that the same sauce?
It looks different.

744
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,180
I guess they have a bunch of different 
flavors.

745
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,800
That's what it was.
A few different flavors.

746
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:50,860
Okay.
This is it that the bomb beyond 

747
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:50,860
insanity.
That's it.

748
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,380
This is the one.
See this one right here?

749
00:33:51,381 --> 00:33:53,150
Yeah,
that's it.

750
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:55,610
Yeah.
Well,

751
00:33:55,611 --> 00:33:57,020
whatever.
Whatever the fuck.

752
00:33:57,021 --> 00:34:00,900
The name of this stuff is.
I got cockY and really?

753
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:01,450
Yeah.
Yeah.

754
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,190
I put like a half a teaspoon of that 
shit in and I,

755
00:34:04,191 --> 00:34:06,300
uh,
I took your suggestions.

756
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,000
I think it was.
No,

757
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:13,390
it was either spaghetti or it was a 
chicken noodle soup from jerry's famous 

758
00:34:14,181 --> 00:34:15,140
deli.
My suggestion,

759
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:15,950
what a.
Doubled it.

760
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,890
I took your suggestion and put it into 
spaghetti.

761
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:20,200
You told him.
Forget it.

762
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,650
When I put it in noodles,
I'm actually,

763
00:34:21,651 --> 00:34:26,651
I'm pretty sure that it was the chicken 
noodle soup because I get that all the 

764
00:34:26,651 --> 00:34:26,651
time.
Um,

765
00:34:26,651 --> 00:34:28,100
but holy fuck,
I was in agony.

766
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:31,010
I was like,
this is the most ridiculous hot sauce of

767
00:34:31,011 --> 00:34:31,880
all time.

768
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,950
It's got a good flavor to it though.
It does.

769
00:34:33,951 --> 00:34:35,360
But it was.
I went to war.

770
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,020
I went to war with wet body,
shit it out.

771
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:43,420
It says habanero pepper enhanced with 
habanero infused flavor.

772
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:48,430
Create a sauce measured at 100,
19,700

773
00:34:48,891 --> 00:34:51,020
scoville units of heat.
Wow.

774
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,600
That's a jalapeno pepper is $2,500.
That is insane.

775
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,910
One hundred 19,700
scoville units.

776
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:06,230
So a lot.
I didn't say anything on a plate of 

777
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,010
spaghetti.
I took like a whole team one bite,

778
00:35:07,011 --> 00:35:12,011
fought on the ground for awhile.
Thump the whole thing back into the 

779
00:35:12,011 --> 00:35:12,050
whole tub of spaghetti.
And then all that was hot.

780
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,970
I didn't think that it was.
Um,

781
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:17,000
I didn't think it was just to narrow.
It seems so strong.

782
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:22,001
I felt like it had to be more than when 
they're really good.

783
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:25,400
Really good habanero sauce.
And you know,

784
00:35:25,401 --> 00:35:27,640
real strong stuff,
but it was nothing like that.

785
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:32,360
That was so good.
Do you ever have liu kotecha?

786
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:35,150
That's my griddle.
That's my shit.

787
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,860
The mexicans know how to make the best 
hot sauce period.

788
00:35:37,861 --> 00:35:40,680
Dude there habanero sauce that you could
tuck.

789
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,180
It's delicious.
It's hot.

790
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:46,050
But it's also really delicious.
Like I put a lot of that shit in my eggs

791
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:50,220
and it's got a lot of heat,
but it's still so the taste is so good.

792
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,200
You get a lot of people don't understand
that.

793
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,120
It's a lot about the taste,
the taste.

794
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,040
It's a pain,
but it goes with the good taste.

795
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:59,070
Yeah.
You don't sound like an asshole.

796
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,530
I love.
Do you ever get challenged where you put

797
00:36:01,531 --> 00:36:02,770
a bunch of hot sauce and someone will be
like,

798
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:07,910
drink this whole thing.
then during this whole thing of tabasco 

799
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:07,910
in,
you're like,

800
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,480
I'm not trying to win it challenged.
Why come on?

801
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:12,060
It's like your dad,
if he catches you smoking a cigarette,

802
00:36:12,061 --> 00:36:15,030
once you smoke the whole pack,
bitches want to try cigarettes.

803
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:19,390
YoU have to fucking stuffing my face 
with a little pack.

804
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:22,040
You're about cvs.
What apple was cvs,

805
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,130
oh,
they're not going to sell cigarettes and

806
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,080
not going to sell tobacco products.
Weird

807
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:30,270
did it anyway.
We had a sell out and they sell alcohol 

808
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:30,270
and it's supposed to be a place to get 
medicine.

809
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,440
For the longest time I was blaming all 
of these Philip Morris like,

810
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,470
oh,
they know it's addictive.

811
00:36:34,471 --> 00:36:35,520
There's still fucking putting it out 
there.

812
00:36:35,521 --> 00:36:36,050
But then you're like,
well,

813
00:36:36,051 --> 00:36:40,330
what about the people selling it?
They know to the stacks.

814
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:45,770
They're just making money off it.
They could easily do with the cbs is 

815
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:45,770
doing

816
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:46,840
so weird.
Especially pharmacies.

817
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,420
Well,
it's weird man,

818
00:36:48,421 --> 00:36:51,030
because there's part of me that says,
hey,

819
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:53,160
I want to be able to buy cigarettes.
If I was an idiot,

820
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,800
if I was an idiot and I decided to start
smoking cigarettes,

821
00:36:55,801 --> 00:36:58,440
I'd want to be able to buy them.
I don't give a fuck if cvs cells,

822
00:36:58,441 --> 00:36:59,530
um,
you know,

823
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:02,250
wants to keep selling them again,
if you don't want make it,

824
00:37:02,251 --> 00:37:02,730
um,
illegal.

825
00:37:02,731 --> 00:37:06,690
But some health place does not have to 
sell but fucking agents of death,

826
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,900
that is kinda creepy that it's a cvs and
think about it that way.

827
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:15,380
They have a tequila,
they end the alcohol and then they have 

828
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:15,910
medicine on the next side.
Just makes no.

829
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:17,960
I mentioned on twitter and all these 
people like,

830
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,200
oh,
they still sell candy.

831
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:20,010
They still do this.
My gosh,

832
00:37:20,011 --> 00:37:22,950
it's a good thing.
It gives people less like direct access,

833
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,140
easy access to a harmful product.
Yeah.

834
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,530
This is good.
It's almost like,

835
00:37:26,531 --> 00:37:27,570
well,
they're just going to get all this,

836
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,650
all this business from the um,
uh,

837
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:30,930
insurance companies now.
And it's like,

838
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:31,350
yeah,
they should,

839
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:34,680
they should get rewarded that reward 
when you do good thing.

840
00:37:34,681 --> 00:37:36,030
It's nice when those people get 
rewarded.

841
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,560
It's not,
doesn't make it bad.

842
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,090
The idea that you could just sell things
that you know are going to kill,

843
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:45,330
they're not held liable.
I mean,

844
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:48,210
it's not even something that gets you.
There's something about,

845
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,020
there's a willingness when you decide 
you're going to drink,

846
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,800
you know,
like when you,

847
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,250
like when if we're at a comedy club,
like you want to do shots,

848
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:59,970
shots,
there's this thing that happens when you

849
00:37:59,971 --> 00:38:03,450
decide that you're going to drink that 
is beneficial.

850
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,340
There's some,
there's camaraderie in it,

851
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,130
there's like fun.
And you know,

852
00:38:07,131 --> 00:38:08,580
there's,
there's happiness to it,

853
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,830
there's a warmth if you're doing it 
right,

854
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,440
you know,
you can enjoy the experience of having a

855
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:16,710
couple of drinks.
But the experience of smoking cigarettes

856
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,660
is just death.
I mean that's all it is.

857
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,450
Nice when you're getting a good circle 
of people.

858
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,220
Yeah.
but it's not changing your,

859
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,690
your fucking state.
I mean,

860
00:38:24,691 --> 00:38:26,520
it might be giving you a little bit of a
stimulation,

861
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:28,650
right?
It gives you a stimulant sort of affect.

862
00:38:28,651 --> 00:38:29,660
Right?
Yeah.

863
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,540
That's interesting.
Friendly

864
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:36,540
thing.
That's what hurt me the most is not 

865
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:36,540
smoke when you see like phrase.
So like just in a circle dissolve.

866
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:36,970
I'm like,
I want to be part of that.

867
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,130
Right,
right.

868
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,640
Yeah.
There's a thing that people do,

869
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:44,641
like people like did that with cigars,
that I sit around cigars and smoke with 

870
00:38:44,641 --> 00:38:47,851
a bunch of guys now it's really weird 
because all the comics are using these 

871
00:38:47,851 --> 00:38:48,640
things.
So you see circles of people using these

872
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:50,200
fake electronic who goes,

873
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,830
well,
those are better than.

874
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:57,070
Those are fucking better for you.
That shit is better for you than 

875
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:57,070
cigarettes,

876
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:00,750
period.
This is great for me for like for chain 

877
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:03,430
smoking or when I'm inside,
it's like chainsmokers thing I would do.

878
00:39:03,431 --> 00:39:05,620
I wouldn't even think about it be like 
working and I'd be smoking,

879
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:06,250
put it out.
I'm like,

880
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:06,840
wait,
where's my.

881
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:07,710
oh,
I already put out like I'm,

882
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:13,290
you know what I mean?
So that's good for like the inbetweens 

883
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,990
and when I'm driving and traffic has 
been like a two pack a day smoker for 

884
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:16,870
years and years when he's already 
telling about 120 days.

885
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,010
The.
yeah.

886
00:39:18,011 --> 00:39:19,240
The good thing about that help people 
quit.

887
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:24,300
The good thing about this is besides 
like the blue cigarettes and like those 

888
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,230
little disposable nicotine ones,
those like you have,

889
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,330
you don't get any kind of satisfaction 
from,

890
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,560
oh really?
In this?

891
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,190
That one looks too much though.
It looks too big.

892
00:39:31,191 --> 00:39:36,191
Like all attention to yourself,
the whole device.

893
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,980
It's a bunch of smoke.
that's topics not even straight on.

894
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:40,390
No,
no you,

895
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,240
it,
it's just too much attention.

896
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:46,520
It's just too big.
Why is it too much attention?

897
00:39:46,521 --> 00:39:47,540
Because it's god.
It's like,

898
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:49,580
look at this thing I'm doing,
I'm doing something different.

899
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:51,800
Everyone look,
is that what it is or is it,

900
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:52,710
is there any,
um,

901
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:55,580
the ones that look the same size as,
as I get that.

902
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,050
AlrIght.
Gluten goes off.

903
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:01,520
You mean like a oil in their eggs?
Yeah,

904
00:40:01,521 --> 00:40:02,540
the blue six.
Yeah.

905
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:05,670
Differences.
This battery lasts a long time and has a

906
00:40:05,671 --> 00:40:08,010
lot of juice in it.
It looks like an electric toothbrush.

907
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:08,290
Yeah,

908
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,620
it looks like when those things that 
they,

909
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:14,680
uh,
they put in your ear to look around.

910
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,550
Oh yeah.

911
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:20,670
Read out.
Also it tells you your temperature and 

912
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:20,670
it also tells you how many hits you've 
had.

913
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,420
And it also says like,
what your battery life.

914
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,580
that is a true.
Let me see that thing.

915
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:29,780
And what's really cool is that they had 
these bars now in los angeles that are 

916
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,190
huge bars,
mixology bars.

917
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:30,850
So you go in,
you're like,

918
00:40:30,851 --> 00:40:32,050
yeah,
I want cotton candy,

919
00:40:32,051 --> 00:40:33,580
but pez and they'll go,
okay.

920
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,170
And then some of those.
Yeah.

921
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:37,120
And it's like these,
it's almost going to a bar.

922
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,130
Okay.
All right.

923
00:40:38,131 --> 00:40:39,050
You're,
you're wrong.

924
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,200
Was this thing's dope?
I do wear a fanny packs.

925
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:50,130
We really selling higher primate.
Got a beautiful one for boots,

926
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:52,850
higher primate logo on it with boots,
roots,

927
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:57,870
you know,
roots the company that makes bags and 

928
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:57,870
make leather bags.
Yeah.

929
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:58,170
They made me one with a higher primate 
logo on it.

930
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:01,880
I got it from dice.
Dice came in and he had a.

931
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:05,760
He had sweatpants on and these,
this fanny pack and I'll go,

932
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,490
that's a beautiful fanny pack.
I'm like,

933
00:41:07,491 --> 00:41:08,510
where'd you get those?
The goal?

934
00:41:08,511 --> 00:41:09,380
Yeah,
it's from root.

935
00:41:09,381 --> 00:41:11,340
It's the best.
And he showed me the fatty,

936
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,820
so I got them.
I got the dice.

937
00:41:13,821 --> 00:41:15,630
Clay,
a fanny pack that my.

938
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:19,340
My family,
my fanny pack is a dice clay inspired.

939
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:21,500
I've just ordered some sweatpants 
online.

940
00:41:21,501 --> 00:41:23,560
I'm waiting to get them and I'm just 
going to start wearing sweatpants.

941
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:28,770
I know I'm going to wear track suits.
No,

942
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:33,120
no,
he's not.

943
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:38,780
I agree with this.
They are comfortable and not worried 

944
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:38,780
about that.
Look,

945
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,130
they have this new sweatpants.
Do that look like pants.

946
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:41,620
Have you seen these things go out like 
that.

947
00:41:41,621 --> 00:41:43,510
That's ridiculous.
Could not go into pants.

948
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,920
You got to wear sweatpants.
You know that's you're full.

949
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,830
You can't put fucking racing stripes on 
a cadillac.

950
00:41:48,831 --> 00:41:51,110
That's just stupid.
that's dumb.

951
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,400
If you get.
What are you going to wear?

952
00:41:52,401 --> 00:41:53,480
Sweat pants.
Their sweatpants.

953
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:58,500
Make them look like sweater and have a 
crease in it makes it look like a 

954
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:58,500
tuxedo.
I'm going to start wearing tracksuits.

955
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,080
Please don't do that.
I cannot sit with you.

956
00:42:00,081 --> 00:42:01,750
If you do that,
you can.

957
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,710
You'll be fine.
these are fine.

958
00:42:03,711 --> 00:42:05,390
I supported you through your cardigan 
days.

959
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:10,700
Never sAid a word.
I never shit on your fucking terrible 

960
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:10,700
dress habits.

961
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,080
I never did.
How dare you say that?

962
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:13,910
You wouldn't support me for athletic 
wear.

963
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,950
That's just drooling.
Athletics.

964
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:17,900
I can see it.
I'm an athletic guy.

965
00:42:17,901 --> 00:42:21,650
I like to move around.
It was breakout close.

966
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:23,720
It don't hold me down.
Cds or sweatpants,

967
00:42:23,721 --> 00:42:25,670
but they look like regular pants.
Oh,

968
00:42:25,671 --> 00:42:26,960
that's nice.
I would wear those.

969
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:28,970
I'd wear those.
Yeah.

970
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,350
I actually would love to wear those.
That's actually.

971
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:36,430
It seems like something that I was like,
sweatpants you're looking at right as 

972
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:37,610
cock aren't.
You can't help it.

973
00:42:37,611 --> 00:42:42,611
I looked at it,
I looked at it for a full three or four 

974
00:42:42,611 --> 00:42:42,611
seconds,
joe,

975
00:42:42,611 --> 00:42:43,000
and he's going to be wearing cookie 
monster sweater.

976
00:42:43,001 --> 00:42:46,610
That's me.
Beautiful and be covered with cat hair.

977
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,990
Show you how much of a beta I am.
I'm all for the tracksuits.

978
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:57,040
I think that needs to make a comeback 
because I hate wearing jews were so 

979
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,450
concerned with what

980
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:02,450
kind of clothes we wear,
but people who were like really into 

981
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:02,450
style,
they're always annoying.

982
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:06,240
Always annoying when they start talking 
to you about,

983
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:07,980
this is a,
this is gucci,

984
00:43:07,981 --> 00:43:11,370
this is and this is a.
This is a ralph lower end.

985
00:43:11,371 --> 00:43:13,290
This artist's prints on with all.
There's all these older artists,

986
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:15,390
others get a little successful and they 
have like sleeves,

987
00:43:15,391 --> 00:43:15,960
but they're like,
oh,

988
00:43:15,961 --> 00:43:20,550
I only wear these types of shoes.
Being into clothes,

989
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:24,520
there's nothing wrong with enjoying.
I think are closer artwork though,

990
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:29,570
don't get me wrong,
but this people that are like really 

991
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:31,950
like obsessive really into style and 
kind of snobbish about it.

992
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,380
That's like a weird thing to give a fuck
about.

993
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,720
You give a fuck that this guy has paint 
on his pants,

994
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,210
like if you and I are hanging out and 
you have pain on your pants,

995
00:43:39,211 --> 00:43:40,470
I could give zero fucks.

996
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:41,740
Is that like a better thing?
Whatever.

997
00:43:41,741 --> 00:43:46,741
You know.
I'm just saying if you choose to wear 

998
00:43:46,741 --> 00:43:49,130
type of shoe,
were you choose to where I can make fun 

999
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,330
of portland.
You can wear anything you want to wear 

1000
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:54,800
anything you want everywhere,
but someone who's like into like rigid 

1001
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:54,800
style.
Oh,

1002
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,970
that's out of style.
That's how style says.

1003
00:43:56,971 --> 00:44:01,971
Fucking who fucking who.
You tell me what the hell board decides 

1004
00:44:03,301 --> 00:44:07,080
what's in style and not installed where?
Whatever the fuck you want.

1005
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:12,320
If you want to wear some sweatpants,
where's fucking sweatpants and anyone 

1006
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,311
who cares is an idiot you.
You can look that guy's walking around 

1007
00:44:16,311 --> 00:44:21,051
in sweatpants and why you give a fuck.
Why would anybody care even slightly?

1008
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:24,420
If someone's walking around wearing 
sweatpants in the office,

1009
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,520
in the,
in the board room,

1010
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,470
what do you give a fuck?
What you have to wear?

1011
00:44:28,471 --> 00:44:32,010
That weird stupid outfit that you wear 
with these stiff

1012
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:37,190
corners,
these sharp edges and a tie around your 

1013
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:40,761
neck,
enough and cuff links that are so 

1014
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:41,340
fucking stupid.
You have to stick some metal,

1015
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,400
extraneous pieces in there and tighten 
up the links because your scholar folds 

1016
00:44:47,611 --> 00:44:49,050
over.
Get the fuck out of here.

1017
00:44:49,051 --> 00:44:51,240
That's what we are.
Shiny,

1018
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:52,260
stupid,
hard,

1019
00:44:52,261 --> 00:44:55,160
soled shoes.
What do you have wood in your shoe?

1020
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:59,850
Bottom of your shoe is would really.
There's wouldn't your shoe.

1021
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,610
What is it?
Fucking 18.

1022
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:04,200
12.
Are you living in Denmark?

1023
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:06,420
You have clogs on you.
Fuckhead.

1024
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,080
Ridiculous.
Why would you have leather?

1025
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,810
Shiny leather on the bottom of your 
toes?

1026
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:16,650
They all slippery and stupid.
That is government at all.

1027
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:19,150
What's with the tassels?
You fucking halfway.

1028
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:22,860
You like tassels and the funnIer shoes.
Idiot man.

1029
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:25,990
What is that?
Extra fancy fucking leather.

1030
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:31,030
The leather tassel and silly and ancient
and dum de dum,

1031
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:35,280
de dum.
Who cares how you dress?

1032
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:36,990
You know I just saw several long in New 
York.

1033
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:39,000
I would put on flip flops,
shorts,

1034
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:42,080
no shirt.
Just get high and walk around it.

1035
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:43,890
Is that cool to walk around with no 
shirt?

1036
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,150
No,
it's not.

1037
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,350
No.
I mean it's allowed,

1038
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:49,200
but people go through it,
but it's not illegal.

1039
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,070
What about women then?
Can women walk around topless?

1040
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:57,990
I know that's been fought for right?
In columbus,

1041
00:45:57,991 --> 00:45:59,100
Ohio.
you can portland.

1042
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:00,070
it can be.
You can be topless.

1043
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:02,580
Yeah.
These tassels.

1044
00:46:02,581 --> 00:46:04,140
Yeah.
Oh my god,

1045
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,450
man.
It's tasks on top of tassels.

1046
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:12,590
You need iowasca.
If you were tassels and issues you need 

1047
00:46:12,691 --> 00:46:17,691
iowasca like that take you away.
Have you ever done that stuff?

1048
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:27,160
Iowasca still have not either.
It's a more prolonged version of a dmt 

1049
00:46:31,281 --> 00:46:35,350
trip that apparently doesn't quite get 
to that dmt flash level really,

1050
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:40,570
but it gives you sort of this weird 
spiritual insight thing that you don't 

1051
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:44,150
necessarily get with dmt.
That's the way it's been described to me

1052
00:46:44,151 --> 00:46:49,151
by my friends who have done it.
It's hard like when you try to relate 

1053
00:46:49,151 --> 00:46:50,810
experiences,
everybody's is very different,

1054
00:46:50,811 --> 00:46:52,760
so like if you haven't personally 
experienced it,

1055
00:46:52,761 --> 00:46:56,450
it's hard to put into context what 
they're saying.

1056
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,460
Like how They're describing something.
Yeah.

1057
00:46:58,461 --> 00:47:01,490
We don't have to put into words,
so one of these days I'll have to do it,

1058
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:04,940
but um,
the dmt flash,

1059
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:10,390
everybody that I've talked to where I've
tried to piece together what they say 

1060
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:14,321
about their experiences,
it's all seems like we're all talkinG 

1061
00:47:14,321 --> 00:47:15,140
about a similar place,
but it's hard to.

1062
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:20,830
It's so wacky that it's hard to put into
like any context on,

1063
00:47:21,921 --> 00:47:23,210
in the real world.

1064
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:28,330
so the words that you use are all the 
wrong words as they're talking about 

1065
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:28,580
talking about god and the voice of god.
He has no voice.

1066
00:47:28,581 --> 00:47:33,581
It's something like is no arm of god is 
there's nothing that we can comprehend 

1067
00:47:33,581 --> 00:47:34,150
if this is,
if it isn't,

1068
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:35,080
you know,
when you,

1069
00:47:35,081 --> 00:47:36,190
when you do that,
if it isn't,

1070
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,840
you actually communicating with 
something.

1071
00:47:37,841 --> 00:47:40,570
If it's all happening inside your head 
and it's all imaginary.

1072
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,930
God damn your brain has some untapped 
potential.

1073
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:46,420
Oh yeah.
Probably if that's in there,

1074
00:47:46,421 --> 00:47:50,810
if that really is just our collective 
minds in there or really is just the,

1075
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:51,530
the,
the,

1076
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:56,540
the,
the depth of the potential of human 

1077
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:00,031
thought and your ability to hallucinate 
or imagined things are your imagination 

1078
00:48:00,031 --> 00:48:02,170
in itself,
the very mechanics of your imagination,

1079
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:05,560
creating all these crazy illusions and 
if that is the case,

1080
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:07,240
like,
wow,

1081
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:12,450
you know what an incredible potential 
the human mind has just on its own that 

1082
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:16,660
just we get to every now and again and 
it puts on this bizarre show of this,

1083
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:20,650
this godlike quality like this,
this perfect,

1084
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,020
idealistic,
utopian,

1085
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:25,480
loving thought process.

1086
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:29,470
The hits you when you're on that stuff 
like of course people think it's god.

1087
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:33,040
I mean maybe it is god and maybe what 
god is is human potential.

1088
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:35,740
It's greatest heights.
This is what god really is.

1089
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,760
Just a concept and maybe we're just 
getting too much of it.

1090
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:42,070
When you have a psychedelic experience,
it's too much.

1091
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,490
Whatever the fuck you know that you're 
tapping into.

1092
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,830
That gives.
I've seen it once,

1093
00:48:47,831 --> 00:48:50,640
but I've never done it.
I watched them on.

1094
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,150
No,
the other stuff.

1095
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:52,960
The empty,
empty.

1096
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,370
Yeah.
Well,

1097
00:48:54,371 --> 00:48:59,371
I'm sure we can make that happen.
If you were willing to sign a few pieces

1098
00:48:59,471 --> 00:49:02,890
of paper for the government to 
participate in this study,

1099
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:05,920
you should get in on the rick strassman 
studies.

1100
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:07,720
What's the.
He's doing it again.

1101
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,840
What to do.
He's the guy that wrote that book,

1102
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:14,450
dmt the spirit molecule.
He was the first guy that was able to,

1103
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:17,890
um,
secure federal research.

1104
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:20,230
Yeah.
He's got a license to be able to do it.

1105
00:49:20,231 --> 00:49:22,630
I don't know if they funded it.
They allowed him to do it,

1106
00:49:22,631 --> 00:49:25,780
but they allowed him to do intravenous 
dmt.

1107
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:27,370
A injection.
Some chippiness.

1108
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:29,800
Yeah.
The book's called dmt,

1109
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:32,380
the spirit molecule.
And it's a fantastic book.

1110
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:34,190
It's really interesting.
He's a,

1111
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:39,450
he's a scientist and he's a strassman 
and say I would donate my Body to 

1112
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:39,450
science.
He's a brilliant,

1113
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:42,280
brilliant guy,
but he's also like a really cool guy.

1114
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:43,230
And uh,
he's,

1115
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,940
he's really nice.
He's a really nice persOn.

1116
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:51,270
And when you hear about his,
a relaying of these people's 

1117
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:53,440
experiences,
the way he set everything up and his,

1118
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:58,770
his willingness to track this idea down 
and try to see what it really is all 

1119
00:49:58,770 --> 00:49:59,800
about is really courageous.
You know,

1120
00:49:59,801 --> 00:50:03,250
for a doctor to do that,
you can get in some weird.

1121
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,830
We can some weird situations where 
people think you're a kook,

1122
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:11,130
But he's dealing with a real chemical so
they can't get funding to study 

1123
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:11,130
mushrooms for the low.

1124
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:15,910
The maps is starting to break some 
boundaries on that and they're starting 

1125
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:16,300
to,
uh,

1126
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:18,100
to make some headway really,
you know?

1127
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:23,110
Yeah.
There was a John Hopkins university 

1128
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:24,190
study and psilocybin maps is the 
something,

1129
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:26,830
multiple disciplinary psychedelic 
studies.

1130
00:50:26,831 --> 00:50:30,080
I don't know what the actual acronym,
how it works,

1131
00:50:30,081 --> 00:50:35,081
but it's probably the number one group 
as far as like really intelligently 

1132
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:40,970
debating and promoting psychedelics and 
the study of psychedelics.

1133
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:42,560
All brilliant,
brilliant guys.

1134
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,630
You know,
we had rick doblin,

1135
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:47,540
who's one of the guys from maps,
one of the head guys.

1136
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:49,820
We had them on the podcast and the guy 
couldn't have been cooler.

1137
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:52,000
I told him I suburban friends that take 
mushrooms.

1138
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:56,060
She didn't.
She's about to turn 40 well burbs.

1139
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:57,040
She was like,
oh no.

1140
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:57,720
We're just like,
yeah,

1141
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:59,060
that sounds like do it through with your
husband.

1142
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,250
Tell to take mushrooms and listened to 
that use youtube song.

1143
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,560
Actually watch it,
watch it.

1144
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:05,780
And when you can video the one fallon 
from fallon.

1145
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,080
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1146
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:12,300
Do you think when you get through a 
certain age though that it might be too 

1147
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:12,300
scary to recommend somebody,
you,

1148
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,380
you don't have herpes and she said I'll 
be scared.

1149
00:51:14,381 --> 00:51:14,680
I'm like,
yeah,

1150
00:51:14,681 --> 00:51:16,090
of course you'll be scared.
Yeah.

1151
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:17,610
But I mean like when you get to a 
certain age,

1152
00:51:17,611 --> 00:51:19,630
it kind of also have that like I'm going
to die.

1153
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:23,350
No,
it's a big hit.

1154
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:29,370
What kind of flavor?
This great mix of a little bit of a 

1155
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:29,800
fucking child.
Pina colada.

1156
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:34,180
You're a black child.
I didn't get anything.

1157
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,240
Yeah,
you have to hold the button the whole 

1158
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:39,240
time.
You kinda,

1159
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:39,240
you can kinda like,
like puff on it almost.

1160
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:42,100
That's kind of the way to do it.
Best puffing on it.

1161
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:45,450
How'd you get the desk while symbol in 
their sticker fit.

1162
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,400
Perfect.
Oh my gosh.

1163
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:48,430
That's hilarious.
But you know,

1164
00:51:48,431 --> 00:51:51,280
like when you're older you kind of have 
like in the back of your head like,

1165
00:51:51,281 --> 00:51:56,281
oh,
you know what if I'm having a heart 

1166
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:56,281
attack because I'm 40,
you know,

1167
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:59,280
like,
because I want to recommend it to 

1168
00:51:59,280 --> 00:51:59,280
somebody that's never done it the same 
way.

1169
00:51:59,280 --> 00:51:59,690
But I told them,
I'm like,

1170
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:02,680
that's ridiculous notion.
She's never done anything like that.

1171
00:52:02,681 --> 00:52:03,380
But yeah,
totally.

1172
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,500
You should let people do what they want 
to do.

1173
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:08,720
If they want to live their whole life 
and never do mushrooms,

1174
00:52:08,721 --> 00:52:09,350
you should let them.

1175
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:11,710
I'm not going to force them to do it.
She didn't even bring it up.

1176
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,470
I shouldn't even bring it up.
Oh no.

1177
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,060
Disagree.
Absolutely.

1178
00:52:15,061 --> 00:52:17,610
Bring it up.
You think you should offer it up?

1179
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:18,840
Oh really?
Yeah.

1180
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,780
Well I think if you want to fuck her,
you should know.

1181
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:27,360
Even if I don't,
I did advise my male friends to try to 

1182
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:27,360
get them to do it.
Do you really?

1183
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:28,220
Yeah.
Yeah.

1184
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:33,890
I'm with me though.
I wonder if I'm gonna try to fuck girls 

1185
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:35,640
to mushrooms with them.
Really weird.

1186
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:37,710
You freak out in front of her.
You ruined.

1187
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:39,830
I can't.
So they don't feel like,

1188
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,610
like held down?
No,

1189
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,040
no way.
That's awesome.

1190
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:47,270
Yeah.
I think,

1191
00:52:47,271 --> 00:52:48,950
uh,
anything you do,

1192
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:53,150
whether it's mushrooms or smoked pot.
I was having a conversation with a buddy

1193
00:52:53,151 --> 00:52:58,151
of mine last night about a friend of 
ours and we were talking about like how 

1194
00:52:58,151 --> 00:53:02,351
this dude could benefit from weed.
This is why he does this because he 

1195
00:53:02,351 --> 00:53:03,050
doesn't smoke smoke pot.
So he's not,

1196
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:08,100
he's not,
he doesn't have that paranoid 

1197
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:08,100
introspective thing that you get when 
you smoke weed.

1198
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:12,860
We start really examining yourself.
Uncomfortable lights people.

1199
00:53:12,861 --> 00:53:17,861
A lot of people don't smoke weed who 
need to lead the quality they're 

1200
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:18,570
lacking.
So they have like this hubris thinking,

1201
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:24,210
oh,
they keep pushing forward without 

1202
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:24,650
considering how they come off to other 
people.

1203
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,950
They just pushing forward.

1204
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:29,520
And this is hubris that will like,
come on man,

1205
00:53:29,521 --> 00:53:31,710
just smoke doesn't stop and think about 
it for a second.

1206
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:34,230
People get caught up.
Also,

1207
00:53:34,231 --> 00:53:36,300
you get caught up and going in a certain
direction.

1208
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:38,400
Like,
like did you see wolf of wall street?

1209
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:38,880
No.
No,

1210
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,430
a good.
Yeah,

1211
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:41,370
it's good.
Yeah.

1212
00:53:41,371 --> 00:53:42,900
I really enjoyed it.
It's really good.

1213
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:48,230
You know,
a lot of people say that martin 

1214
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:49,371
scorsese,
like his movies are kind of like 

1215
00:53:49,371 --> 00:53:49,371
formulaic.
Yeah.

1216
00:53:49,371 --> 00:53:51,420
But I say those people can go fuck 
themselves because uh,

1217
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:54,630
what he does is he wrote a column.
He knows how to do it,

1218
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:55,200
man,
I should've.

1219
00:53:55,390 --> 00:54:00,390
I'm sorry.
So good with words for my next 1500 

1220
00:54:00,511 --> 00:54:02,460
words that I don't need.
Here's a picture.

1221
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:07,640
Boom.
He just knows how to make a movie that 

1222
00:54:07,891 --> 00:54:09,150
like,
it's different.

1223
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:14,420
Like he'll do things like,
like there's a part when leonardo 

1224
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:14,420
dicaprio,
like,

1225
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:18,740
you know,
everyone's moving and talking and they 

1226
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:18,740
just stopped talking,
but there,

1227
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:19,140
there's no sound coming out.

1228
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:24,140
But he's walking towards the camera and 
looking at you essentially completely 

1229
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:24,840
cut out the sound of all the other 
people and he's talking to you.

1230
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:27,360
It's like these weird little things that
he does,

1231
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,430
like this is the chaos of the trading 
room floor.

1232
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:31,790
And as leonardo dicaprio walkthrough 
through it,

1233
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:33,360
it's,
there's no sound.

1234
00:54:33,361 --> 00:54:35,680
Just him talking.
He's explaining his life.

1235
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:40,850
The world shifted.
The record goes saying something about 

1236
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:40,850
something.
He's just dope.

1237
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:42,650
He's just dope.
Martin scorsese,

1238
00:54:42,651 --> 00:54:44,330
he's just a master.
He's just,

1239
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:49,560
he had his shot and I'm a taxi driver 
where it's when you see a guy walking 

1240
00:54:51,211 --> 00:54:53,340
towards the camera,
a character walk towards the camera,

1241
00:54:53,341 --> 00:54:58,341
and then you'd see another angle like 
cut right from there to cameron moving 

1242
00:54:58,341 --> 00:55:01,521
towards something and you're like,
that's the point of view of the guy we 

1243
00:55:01,521 --> 00:55:01,521
just saw.
Right.

1244
00:55:01,521 --> 00:55:04,450
Um,
so then he started having a pan across 

1245
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:06,210
that view starts panning across the taxi
place all the way around and around,

1246
00:55:06,211 --> 00:55:10,440
and then it's that it puts the deniro in
the shot was supposed to be his point of

1247
00:55:10,441 --> 00:55:11,590
view and all of a sudden he's in it.

1248
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:17,710
He just does stuff like that.
This shooting is just as craZy as this 

1249
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:17,710
character is.
Yeah,

1250
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:18,090
yeah.
Yeah.

1251
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,940
You,
that deeper shit gets you feeling loopy.

1252
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,420
Yeah.
There's just a,

1253
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:25,880
this such an art to filmmaking.
No,

1254
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:29,430
I don't have any desire to ever do it,
but it seems like a lot of work.

1255
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,200
Oh my god.
It seems like so much work,

1256
00:55:31,201 --> 00:55:33,640
but I appreciate the shit out of it.
You know,

1257
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:38,750
I really,
really appreciate someone who's really 

1258
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,521
good at it.
Someone who just really knows how to 

1259
00:55:40,521 --> 00:55:41,230
make a movie that you go to see go 
fucking a as a good guy.

1260
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,330
American hustle is a good guy.
That's pretty good.

1261
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,310
That's a good fucking movie,
man.

1262
00:55:47,311 --> 00:55:52,311
That is a good fucking movie man.
Christian hail is such a bad mother 

1263
00:55:52,311 --> 00:55:54,390
fucker and he's pretty good at either.
Damn.

1264
00:55:54,391 --> 00:55:56,070
He's good.
Yeah.

1265
00:55:56,750 --> 00:56:01,750
Do you ever see the machinist and those 
women were fuckinG fantastic to the 

1266
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:02,610
chick from the hunger games?
Oh yeah.

1267
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,230
God damn fantastic.
Prior what?

1268
00:56:07,231 --> 00:56:09,120
I'm moving.
bradley cooper was awesome.

1269
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:14,270
You haven't seen it yet.
I don't see movies unless I have a 

1270
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:16,521
girlfriend.
I just never think about what you mean 

1271
00:56:16,521 --> 00:56:16,521
ladies.
You hear that cry for help.

1272
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:21,210
Don't let another seAson go by without,
without brian red band.

1273
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,980
FInding a girlfriend.
I live a totally different

1274
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:28,980
life.
When I'm in a relationship like a 

1275
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:28,980
relationship,
I don't do shit.

1276
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:28,980
I don't watch tv.
I don't want you to movies.

1277
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,880
What do you do?
Play with dogs.

1278
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:32,620
You just don't do anything.
Furious.

1279
00:56:32,621 --> 00:56:37,621
Masturbation from the jump.
Alarm clock goes off and we begin the 

1280
00:56:39,641 --> 00:56:44,641
race.
That's how many times you can masturbate

1281
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:47,300
in the day.
What do you.

1282
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:52,330
You get to?
Probably like three or four guys know 

1283
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:54,160
you could do more than that.
A day started right away.

1284
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,020
About five or six.
For me,

1285
00:56:56,021 --> 00:56:58,440
I'd say you get this,
you can get to seven to 10 I think,

1286
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,140
but by the end,
what the fuck is kind of madness?

1287
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:07,200
It's mostly just liquid.
I wouldn't be afraid of that madness 

1288
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,510
filling my head with seeds.
What do you mean like back off?

1289
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:14,230
Seven times in a day with the things 
that I need to think of in order to come

1290
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:18,250
after times five and six,
what are the madness?

1291
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:23,310
The fucking craZy savage jeans that I 
have to tap into my last load off or 

1292
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:26,200
slow to give yourself more room.
I don't want those.

1293
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:31,530
I like smelling your wife's pillow.
I don't want those thoughts that are 

1294
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:31,530
already up from there.
I don't want those thoughts.

1295
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:33,820
I don't want.
I don't want to hit comma number seven.

1296
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,110
That's that's,
that's the person,

1297
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,710
but you have to keep going.
I don't like that person fucking figured

1298
00:57:41,711 --> 00:57:46,360
out that I kind of thinking about dead 
cats.

1299
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:54,430
You go from It being central to being a 
violent release of soldiers.

1300
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:59,460
That's how you orgasm.
Thinking a bunch of angry release of 

1301
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:03,001
demon soldiers flying out of your take 
on this boner pills make me masturbate a

1302
00:58:06,131 --> 00:58:08,770
lot more.
Really strike out.

1303
00:58:08,771 --> 00:58:09,490
And then you're like,
oh,

1304
00:58:09,491 --> 00:58:12,850
well know they just last week with his 
bone and asked for like 24 to 48 hours.

1305
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:15,850
Looked up like what happened?
Take that stuff a lot.

1306
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:22,810
Nope.
You never even looked into it.

1307
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:27,610
I want propecia postcard,
whatever it was.

1308
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:31,860
I read a bunch of side effects and it 
was like depression,

1309
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,670
all stuff that maybe.
I don't know.

1310
00:58:33,671 --> 00:58:35,350
I think maybe it's stuff was caused by 
that.

1311
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,750
I think a hair shit.
Yeah.

1312
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:42,830
I had a bad reaction to that stuff.
It killed my bone on bone arthritis in 

1313
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:44,460
there too.
Killed my boners and it also made me,

1314
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:45,770
um,
uh,

1315
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:48,690
it made me more tired when I would work 
out.

1316
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:51,150
I didn't have as much endurance when I 
got off of it.

1317
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:56,180
My boners came back with a vengeance and
it felt like I had more energy training 

1318
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:57,120
and I was like,
man,

1319
00:58:57,121 --> 00:59:00,330
I wonder if that's affecting me in an 
extreme way.

1320
00:59:00,331 --> 00:59:02,510
Like everybody has like a different 
stages.

1321
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:07,550
The way it processes a testosterone to 
dihydrotestosterone see that everybody 

1322
00:59:09,031 --> 00:59:11,850
has a different bodies reaction.
So weird.

1323
00:59:11,851 --> 00:59:14,820
You know,
like some people are allergic to certain

1324
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,750
types of antibiotics or they're allergic
to penicillin or they're allergic to,

1325
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:21,030
you know,
people get weird rolls of the.

1326
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:24,800
With your bodies is.
It might be that my body didn't react to

1327
00:59:24,801 --> 00:59:26,630
it very well,
but I know a,

1328
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:27,560
I have a buddy who's on it.

1329
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:32,560
There's no problems with it at all.
He's been taking that shit for like 10 

1330
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:32,560
years.
Most people don't.

1331
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:32,780
Yeah.
For me it was a problem,

1332
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,680
but I didn't realiZe it was a problem 
until after I stopped taking it.

1333
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:42,070
When it stopped,
like I ran out of it and all suddenly 

1334
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:43,360
take was like woken up from a coma to go
in bold.

1335
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:46,250
Hello?
Hello?

1336
00:59:46,570 --> 00:59:47,300
You.
Your head was.

1337
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:48,740
You look great when you shaved your 
head.

1338
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,630
Oh,
I didn't go.

1339
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:52,370
I did not like the shape that you don't 
have to,

1340
00:59:52,371 --> 00:59:57,371
but I'm telling you,
you look great with a shaved head or 

1341
00:59:57,371 --> 00:59:57,371
going to have shaved heads in five 
years.

1342
00:59:57,371 --> 01:00:00,050
There's a reason why the monks did it.
It's and I don't give a fuck move.

1343
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,110
I mean I was,
for me,

1344
01:00:03,111 --> 01:00:06,230
it was a matter of aesthetics.
My hair was getting so gross.

1345
01:00:06,231 --> 01:00:11,231
It was got down to the point where like,
you shouldn't keep getting haircuts if 

1346
01:00:11,231 --> 01:00:12,080
every time you get your haircut,
your hair still looks like shit.

1347
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:15,560
WhaT am I paying your shop all this shit
off.

1348
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:18,590
But I would have done now that diet now 
that I've done,

1349
01:00:18,591 --> 01:00:21,930
I would have done a long ass time ago.
It's the easiest way to deal with it.

1350
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:23,900
Like you've got a round head.
Yeah,

1351
01:00:23,901 --> 01:00:25,860
it works.
Good head for,

1352
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:30,900
for being bald,
but getting your hair cut is so 

1353
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:32,880
annoying.
Having to schedule that time out of your

1354
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,660
day and sit down and listen to some 
nonsense.

1355
01:00:35,661 --> 01:00:37,640
I had a cool hairdresser for a long 
time,

1356
01:00:37,641 --> 01:00:42,641
my friend gabrielle up,
so she was a hairdresser from the news 

1357
01:00:42,641 --> 01:00:43,120
radio days,
but yeah,

1358
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:46,300
she's really cool.
Cool italian lady from New York,

1359
01:00:46,301 --> 01:00:48,830
so we've been friends for a long time,
so I used to actually enjoy.

1360
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:53,980
She probably kept me from cutting my 
hair off for a long time just because I 

1361
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:55,430
enjoyed hanging out with her.
Go to see her like once a month.

1362
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:56,600
They're the coolest ones,
man.

1363
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:58,580
On a shoot.
That the wardrobe stylist.

1364
01:00:58,640 --> 01:00:59,840
A wardrobe,
a hairstylist.

1365
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,100
So the only.
She's funny.

1366
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:03,470
She's a funny New York,
like a hard ass,

1367
01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:04,820
a cool lady.

1368
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:10,250
The makeup people always hate me because
of your ego because you always had that 

1369
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:13,761
rule of like I never put makeup on like 
on tv shows and stuff and so that twice 

1370
01:01:13,761 --> 01:01:13,761
I've had to say,
no,

1371
01:01:13,761 --> 01:01:14,160
no,
no makeup.

1372
01:01:14,161 --> 01:01:14,990
I don't do that.
They're like,

1373
01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:16,780
what are you talking about?
You have to know.

1374
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:22,010
You don't have to try to get me.
The other day when I was doing fox 

1375
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:22,010
sports one,
I go,

1376
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:22,620
nope guy,
we're just going to put a little powder.

1377
01:01:22,621 --> 01:01:23,110
I'm like,
yeah,

1378
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,260
that's all right though.
This is what I look like.

1379
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,920
This is exactly what it looked like.
pretended look different than I looked 

1380
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,490
this crazy.
Like get a smooth my skin out.

1381
01:01:32,491 --> 01:01:37,491
What are you going to do?
I let them do what they want to get a 

1382
01:01:37,491 --> 01:01:37,491
light.
Me funny and soft.

1383
01:01:37,491 --> 01:01:37,850
Like I'm an angel.
What are you going to do it?

1384
01:01:37,851 --> 01:01:40,050
They'll fucking do up lighting.
This is look man.

1385
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:42,030
No one's perfect.
This is what I look like.

1386
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:46,740
What do you look like?
High fucking relax.

1387
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:47,910
You don't have to put makeup on people.

1388
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,620
She got mad.
She got upset.

1389
01:01:49,621 --> 01:01:50,070
Like,
look,

1390
01:01:50,071 --> 01:01:55,071
this is mY job.
If you don't get makeup doesn't stop 

1391
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:55,071
hiring.

1392
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:55,071
You know what?
People are stIll gonna want makeup.

1393
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:59,920
So there's nothing wrong with makeup.
I wore makeup everyday when I was on 

1394
01:01:59,920 --> 01:01:59,920
newsradio.
Yeah.

1395
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,850
they'd been make every type we filmed.
They put makeup on me.

1396
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:05,030
They just want to do and I couldn't say 
no.

1397
01:02:05,031 --> 01:02:08,780
Then you know who was there anything I 
did to be a dick.

1398
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:12,260
I was just totally replaceable.
I was totally replaceable.

1399
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:17,261
I wasn't nobody on that show replay 
actually replaced the guy who replaced 

1400
01:02:17,631 --> 01:02:18,680
ray romano.
So they took.

1401
01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:21,450
Armando was booked for the pilot,
but they didn't shoot the pilot with ray

1402
01:02:21,451 --> 01:02:22,140
romano.
No.

1403
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:27,260
This is what happened.
Ray romano was booked for the pilot and 

1404
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,610
he was working,
but they decided somewhere in the middle

1405
01:02:29,611 --> 01:02:34,611
of race thing.
I don't know if they weren't happy with 

1406
01:02:34,611 --> 01:02:37,731
him or they decided to go a different 
way with the character and he was 

1407
01:02:37,731 --> 01:02:40,380
originally the last minute like we got 
to switch.

1408
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:41,070
Um,
you,

1409
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:46,160
you're beginning when they're coming up 
with ideas and it's throwing the ideas 

1410
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:50,121
around for a pilot.
It's not uncommon for them to change a 

1411
01:02:50,121 --> 01:02:50,121
character.
They liked,

1412
01:02:50,121 --> 01:02:53,451
decide they need a different dynamic.
They have all these different dynamics 

1413
01:02:53,451 --> 01:02:55,340
and ray was more of a laid back sort of 
a dynamic.

1414
01:02:55,500 --> 01:03:00,500
That's who he is,
you know where I'm going to see him on 

1415
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:00,500
the show,
you know,

1416
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:03,920
he's like a laid back sort of a guy and 
I think they wanted someone who was a 

1417
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:03,920
little aggressive.
So when,

1418
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,550
who was an idiot who's Like,
I'm a male idiot,

1419
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:07,140
that was going to do aggressive stupid 
shit.

1420
01:03:07,141 --> 01:03:09,780
That leaves room for funny.
So I got lucky.

1421
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:15,330
I came along after ray was replaced by 
another guy who just fill it in for the 

1422
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:17,520
guy.
He was in the pilot.

1423
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:18,690
The other guy was in the pilot.

1424
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:20,220
He didn't think he had a job full time 
job.

1425
01:03:20,221 --> 01:03:21,570
I don't know what he thought.
I don't know.

1426
01:03:21,571 --> 01:03:25,200
I don't know if the car.
Yeah,

1427
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:30,201
maybe if he was really good they would 
have kept him or maybe if he was what 

1428
01:03:30,201 --> 01:03:30,201
they were looking for,
they would have kept him.

1429
01:03:30,201 --> 01:03:30,990
So then they did.
Um,

1430
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:36,140
did he knows.
The funny thing about the audition is 

1431
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:36,870
that the first stuff that they wrote,
it was,

1432
01:03:36,871 --> 01:03:40,650
it was really interesting because um,
it wasn't that funny.

1433
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:45,980
It was like more like matter of factly 
or was more like setting up a character.

1434
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:50,550
It was like there was no jokes in them 
were very subtle.

1435
01:03:50,551 --> 01:03:51,360
It was like a,
uh,

1436
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:56,540
a behavior sort of a piece and a lot of 
guys like totally like tried to overdo 

1437
01:03:57,631 --> 01:04:00,330
it and try to make it like really funny.
It just wasn't really funny.

1438
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:04,020
And they were saying they did that.
The writers did that because they wanted

1439
01:04:04,021 --> 01:04:05,830
to make sure that no one would try to 
ham it up.

1440
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:06,360
Whoa.
Really?

1441
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,680
Like if it's funny,
it's funny,

1442
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:12,710
you know,
like say it to make it funny like you 

1443
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:12,710
know how to say it to make it funny or 
not,

1444
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:14,050
but if it's not funny,
don't pretend it is.

1445
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:16,920
You can't have everything.
Doesn't have to be a joke.

1446
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:22,100
Like some things and not a joke and some
things are a joke just because you're 

1447
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:22,290
creating a character like that,
you know,

1448
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:27,291
that character.
So when the character does like typical 

1449
01:04:27,291 --> 01:04:27,291
things like that,
that character would,

1450
01:04:27,291 --> 01:04:28,030
it was like a joke of recognition.
Right.

1451
01:04:28,310 --> 01:04:33,310
You know,
so then the second time I came in for 

1452
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:34,710
the second one on the ground near bears,
his feet always go pick her up.

1453
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:36,220
Yeah.
I wouldn't call it,

1454
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:38,370
I'll just pick it up,
put it in my pocket,

1455
01:04:38,371 --> 01:04:39,860
let him go like,
oh my god,

1456
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:40,180
I just.

1457
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:44,470
Well you guys have like routines.
You go to things.

1458
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,790
Yeah.
Based on what you know already.

1459
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:50,970
But at the second time I went in for the
audition,

1460
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:53,010
they wrote something really funny that 
was like,

1461
01:04:53,011 --> 01:04:54,300
whoa,
this is hilarious.

1462
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:59,600
It was really good stuff.
So then they had narrowed it down to a 

1463
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,410
group of people that they thought were 
not going to ham it up.

1464
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,920
And then they gave the smallest group to
the remaining groups shit to be funny 

1465
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:07,870
with.
Oh,

1466
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:09,690
right.
So they were super.

1467
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:12,690
I don't know,
I don't know those guys.

1468
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:14,520
Oh,
there's just a couple of guys.

1469
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:18,020
But I remember things I there.
Uh,

1470
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:20,740
there's one thing that gives you 
confidence.

1471
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:24,250
It's to see other people falling apart.
Subtests who's just fall apart.

1472
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:29,280
One of the guy who was auditioning,
one of the guys who is waiting to 

1473
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,771
audition,
who's totally fall apart or is visibly 

1474
01:05:31,771 --> 01:05:31,850
sweaty,
like he was sweaty,

1475
01:05:31,851 --> 01:05:36,430
like it was sweat was dripping down his 
head really going over the lines in this

1476
01:05:36,431 --> 01:05:40,720
like really weird,
like a frantic way.

1477
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:44,380
Like he was like kind of mouthing the 
lines while you're sitting there.

1478
01:05:44,381 --> 01:05:46,600
But it was like,
it was like he was falling apart.

1479
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,010
He was like,
no shit.

1480
01:05:48,011 --> 01:05:49,340
Fuck.
Yeah,

1481
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:50,140
yeah,
yeah.

1482
01:05:50,141 --> 01:05:55,141
There was something he was doing that 
gave me massive confidence and I 

1483
01:05:55,141 --> 01:05:55,141
remember thinking,
oh,

1484
01:05:55,141 --> 01:05:56,890
if I just got an audition with this guy,
is gonna fall apart,

1485
01:05:57,210 --> 01:05:59,210
one down,
I guess you know,

1486
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:02,140
it's probably one of those guys that had
been in hollywood like,

1487
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:07,500
look,
when you're coming out here and you try 

1488
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:07,780
and audition for shows,
it's totally a crapshoot.

1489
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:12,900
You could get super lucky on the very 
first show you get cast and all of a 

1490
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,890
sudden you're on television show.
It probably helps that you don't know if

1491
01:06:14,891 --> 01:06:16,630
it's earlier where you don't really know
the stakes.

1492
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,310
Yeah,
maybe it does,

1493
01:06:18,311 --> 01:06:21,760
but it also helps if you just get lucky 
and you are what they're looking for,

1494
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:26,500
but you could also be here for 20 years 
and never get cast and shit.

1495
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:27,870
That's.
That's possible.

1496
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,510
Especially if you have the wrong look or
the wrong,

1497
01:06:31,511 --> 01:06:36,511
you know,
whatever you do always used to say 

1498
01:06:36,511 --> 01:06:36,511
everybody in this town through others,
ones away from being a bigger star.

1499
01:06:36,511 --> 01:06:37,840
Yup.
Three auditions away.

1500
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:39,460
Yeah.
Everybody,

1501
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,530
every single person.
I mean,

1502
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:46,531
look,
there's some fucking really untalented 

1503
01:06:46,531 --> 01:06:46,531
people on television right now that are 
stars,

1504
01:06:46,531 --> 01:06:49,270
stars of reality shows.
I mean really untalented people.

1505
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:51,190
Are you really gonna chew into the 
microphone.

1506
01:06:51,191 --> 01:06:51,820
You motherfucker.

1507
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:57,180
Rosanna is out here for what?
A week or gay and she got passed at the 

1508
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:00,530
comedy store and then she got a tv show 
like quickly thereafter.

1509
01:07:00,531 --> 01:07:00,830
Was it?
Yeah,

1510
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:04,470
she had a craZy ride.
She was in denver.

1511
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:06,030
She started out in denver.
Oh yeah.

1512
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:09,960
She got really good in denver a for now.
By the time she came.

1513
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:11,520
Well,
you know what man,

1514
01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:16,950
there's a,
there's a kind of an attitude that a 

1515
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:18,150
denver people have.
There's like they're friendly folks,

1516
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:19,740
but you know,
there's a,

1517
01:07:19,741 --> 01:07:23,790
there's a hard edge to that place.
I mean they're in the rocky mountains.

1518
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:25,350
They have bears and shit there,
you know,

1519
01:07:25,351 --> 01:07:27,270
it's like,
it's a crazy place to live.

1520
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:29,250
Could be living in colorado's a little 
nutty.

1521
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:32,090
So they tolerate a little more like 
hardy.

1522
01:07:32,091 --> 01:07:33,000
Yes.
You know what I mean?

1523
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:38,210
And so rosanne like coming out of there 
and then going to the comedy store is 

1524
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:42,411
like,
she had already built up this app in 

1525
01:07:42,411 --> 01:07:42,411
this cool,
smart,

1526
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:47,450
hard edge town in denver is people 
dealing with the fucking elements every 

1527
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:51,800
day.
And then from there she's in la and 

1528
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:51,800
there's no comics like her,
you know,

1529
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:56,490
she's,
she's talked be housewife killing to ken

1530
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:57,810
lang.
It's probably hard to follow.

1531
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:59,460
Oh,
you could never follow where,

1532
01:07:59,461 --> 01:08:01,840
man.
Do you remember people that have a.

1533
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:02,910
I mean,
dude,

1534
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:07,860
if folks who weren't alive when roseanne
barr first hit,

1535
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:13,520
she's like her voice ignored rate.
But then I gave it another shot and few 

1536
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:13,520
years later I was like,
oh,

1537
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,430
this show's pretty good.
She's a great comic.

1538
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:16,550
Yes.

1539
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:18,290
Yeah.
Especially back in the day,

1540
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:19,640
you know,
especially when she,

1541
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:22,700
when she first made it,
she to me is one of the most influential

1542
01:08:22,701 --> 01:08:24,050
comedians ever.
Really?

1543
01:08:24,210 --> 01:08:29,210
Yup.
Because for women that had never been a 

1544
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:29,210
woman like her before,
she's the kinison version of a woman.

1545
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:32,360
Never been a woman like that before.
She actually had 30 minutes.

1546
01:08:32,361 --> 01:08:33,830
So I don't know,
man.

1547
01:08:33,831 --> 01:08:35,590
She did more than one special.
I mean,

1548
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:37,870
she didn't maintain that level of stand 
up,

1549
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:42,920
you know,
once she became super famous and the tv 

1550
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:42,920
show of the attitude of like,
no,

1551
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:43,160
this is why I'm not trying to be 
anything.

1552
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:48,310
She was bad ass dude.
When she was before she got her 

1553
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:48,310
television show and she was just doing 
stand up.

1554
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:50,690
She was bad ass.
There was no women like her before.

1555
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:55,780
She was a total new thing.
She was an overweight white woman who 

1556
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:58,130
didn't give a fuck,
didn't give a fuck.

1557
01:08:58,130 --> 01:08:59,880
And she had kids and she didn't give a 
fuck.

1558
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:04,910
You mitZi of black rose dead rose.
That's a message.

1559
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:08,330
I don't know.
Massive following each other.

1560
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,610
Roses are the rarest of all risks.
Mmm.

1561
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:12,780
Like roses.
Well,

1562
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:16,100
it's a nice thing to send then,
unless it's voodoo attached.

1563
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:17,040
Oh,
maybe it is.

1564
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:18,200
My notes from footie.
WhaT?

1565
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,120
Roseanne believes.
A lot of wacky shit.

1566
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:21,830
She's out there sometimes.
Oh dude,

1567
01:09:21,831 --> 01:09:23,150
she's so out there.
She's like,

1568
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:28,200
she won't touch.
It's one of those really very rarely 

1569
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:28,200
will touch with.
Oh,

1570
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,840
well congrats.
You're fucking.

1571
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:33,680
I feel pretty good about it.
Don't get mad at me,

1572
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:36,050
bro.
I didn't meet her.

1573
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:41,080
she wouldn't shake my hand.
He introduced me to her in the fucking 

1574
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,800
office building one on this street.
Wow.

1575
01:09:42,801 --> 01:09:43,820
That's sad.
I'm sorry.

1576
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:49,210
Sorry.
I was just thinking like that's not 

1577
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:49,210
acceptable to say I don't shake hands.

1578
01:09:49,330 --> 01:09:52,240
Just don't do that.
Well,

1579
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:57,280
what about people that are like crazy a 
add and worried about what diseases with

1580
01:09:57,741 --> 01:09:59,570
enough famous,
excessive compulsive.

1581
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:01,880
They just die.
I don't know man.

1582
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:04,320
I mean you can't do that at the plant,
right?

1583
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:06,040
You can't.
No one's going to accept that.

1584
01:10:06,370 --> 01:10:09,100
Everybody's in the flintstones.
Fucking.

1585
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,590
I don't shake hands.
What?

1586
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,500
No way.
Yeah.

1587
01:10:15,501 --> 01:10:16,880
Why?
Why is that allowed?

1588
01:10:16,881 --> 01:10:19,820
Right?
Why it has to be like it's a movie.

1589
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:20,810
A thing.
Yeah.

1590
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:22,910
It's a fame thing.
Our cues.

1591
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:23,950
Well,
I think we're,

1592
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:29,050
I was saying,
I think we're uniquely fortunate in 

1593
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:32,471
being stand up comedians that you were 
forced to look at ourselves all the time

1594
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:37,400
and I think if you want to think about 
someone who gets pushed into these weird

1595
01:10:37,401 --> 01:10:39,920
boxes of,
of power,

1596
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:42,380
you the power,
that sort of unnatural,

1597
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:46,070
you know,
power that really doesn't exist anywhere

1598
01:10:46,071 --> 01:10:46,600
in the,
in the,

1599
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:51,610
the,
the natural world where someone is like 

1600
01:10:51,610 --> 01:10:51,650
more famous than other people.

1601
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:56,030
So everyone around them is terrified of 
them.

1602
01:10:56,240 --> 01:11:01,240
And so they,
what they do is they just have these 

1603
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:04,840
situations where they have a show and 
throw soda at the fucking guy who was 

1604
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:08,660
running the show or they were talking 
about like one of those,

1605
01:11:08,661 --> 01:11:10,240
um,
grace under fire.

1606
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:15,270
BreN butler apparently threw him in the 
face of the dude who was doing grace 

1607
01:11:15,361 --> 01:11:16,650
under fire.
Really?

1608
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:17,370
Yeah.
Yeah.

1609
01:11:17,371 --> 01:11:20,740
He had like fuckiNg swore at him and 
said some nasty shit to them.

1610
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:23,160
And then they canceled the show.
Oh yeah.

1611
01:11:23,161 --> 01:11:28,161
She was like,
I'm too big for this total unnatural 

1612
01:11:28,161 --> 01:11:30,480
behavior to have this one person like 
brett butler,

1613
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:36,420
repercussions and without thinking about
yourself all the time,

1614
01:11:36,601 --> 01:11:39,540
without examining it must be a weird,
weird.

1615
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:44,820
What is his hecklers?
Seventy five percent of hecklers are 

1616
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:44,900
cute women.
CuTe too.

1617
01:11:44,910 --> 01:11:47,660
Above women trying to get some.
Try to get some arch feared,

1618
01:11:47,661 --> 01:11:47,880
dig.

1619
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:48,960
No,
just trying to like.

1620
01:11:48,961 --> 01:11:50,880
They've never been told to shut up 
because they're too pretty.

1621
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:55,970
There's a little of that.
There's a little consultant you don't 

1622
01:11:55,970 --> 01:11:55,970
know that like this has nothing to do 
with you.

1623
01:11:55,970 --> 01:11:59,150
Be quiet while people get confused and 
think that because you're talking,

1624
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:01,640
they should be able to talk to ya.
Waiting,

1625
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:02,270
man.
Yes.

1626
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:05,920
Can't talk.
Can't just be talking now.

1627
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:06,250
Now,
now,

1628
01:12:06,251 --> 01:12:07,950
now,
now I don't agree with them.

1629
01:12:07,951 --> 01:12:10,380
I'm going to saY something.
I'm going to say something.

1630
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,350
No,
iT's not cool.

1631
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:15,710
Not calgary.
I had her.

1632
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:18,000
She wrote letters to every one of the 
clubs.

1633
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:23,001
I was booked out for the next 15 weeks 
saying what a horrible person I am and 

1634
01:12:23,001 --> 01:12:26,340
how she didn't do anything for being 
horrible.

1635
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,430
she was talking all through the first 
guy and then I started.

1636
01:12:29,431 --> 01:12:30,090
I was like,
stop,

1637
01:12:30,091 --> 01:12:35,091
stop.
I saw you talking about 30 straight 

1638
01:12:35,091 --> 01:12:35,091
minutes.

1639
01:12:35,091 --> 01:12:35,091
You've got to be quiet.
You're just not gonna.

1640
01:12:35,091 --> 01:12:35,091
We're not gonna do that.
And then theY were like,

1641
01:12:35,091 --> 01:12:36,240
all right.
They did one more thing.

1642
01:12:36,241 --> 01:12:40,080
I told them to be quiet again and then I
heard it go next subject and I was like,

1643
01:12:40,081 --> 01:12:42,720
get out.
Just go get out of here front seats.

1644
01:12:42,721 --> 01:12:44,100
We got.
We got an extra ones.

1645
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:46,890
I just had to do throughout my first 
person.

1646
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:48,810
I found your place to the other day for 
same thing.

1647
01:12:48,811 --> 01:12:53,811
The girl talking the whole time,
that boyfriend would not shut her up to 

1648
01:12:53,811 --> 01:12:53,811
the boyfriend's.
I'll just shut her up.

1649
01:12:53,811 --> 01:12:58,400
She just happened to be shadow girl up.
You either ask her to be quiet or you 

1650
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,660
asked her to leave with you or you leave
her there.

1651
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:05,340
Her up man.
That shit never works.

1652
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:09,450
Especially like a really mouthy woman 
was really like,

1653
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:10,560
that's what she likes to do.

1654
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:16,040
People like some people like hold back 
all week long and they liked to get 

1655
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,910
drunk and fight.
Get crazy.

1656
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:23,350
Get fucking aggressive.
It ruined my whole entire set because 

1657
01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:24,090
she was just fucking sitting there the 
whole time and I'm just like,

1658
01:13:24,130 --> 01:13:25,400
alright,
couldn't take it anymore.

1659
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:28,740
It happens all the time.
Yeah,

1660
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:30,010
it's weird,
you know,

1661
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:35,210
it's the enemy oF comedy sometimes,
but then sometimes it's fucking 

1662
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:38,121
hilarious.
Sometimes it turns out to be something 

1663
01:13:38,121 --> 01:13:38,121
funny.
You know?

1664
01:13:38,121 --> 01:13:41,251
We also have the advantage that we were 
comedy store comics and there was no 

1665
01:13:41,251 --> 01:13:41,251
crowd control.
None.

1666
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:43,650
Zero.
We like people would say like,

1667
01:13:43,651 --> 01:13:47,490
I would do like a show and some of the 
hackle and it will go so well.

1668
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,140
People would say.
Was that planned?

1669
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:50,370
Like,
was that guy a plant?

1670
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:51,000
Like,
no.

1671
01:13:51,001 --> 01:13:53,460
Where'd you come up with all that stuff?
Like when you,

1672
01:13:53,490 --> 01:13:54,910
when you started out at the comedy 
store,

1673
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:57,420
you go to war.
Not only is it not police,

1674
01:13:57,510 --> 01:13:59,910
even when you come off and it's been a 
horrible heckler the whole time.

1675
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:01,770
No one that goes to the door,
guy goes,

1676
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:03,080
oh,
you should throw somebody out there.

1677
01:14:03,081 --> 01:14:04,920
Just moan about it in the back to 
themselves.

1678
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:09,980
Yeah.
And then the next idea after that deals 

1679
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:10,020
with it and nobody says something.
Yeah,

1680
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,130
it's hilarious.
Have a to that place

1681
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:15,540
was the worst.
I alwaYs thought that people were.

1682
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:18,190
You throw him out if he was talking to 
the mayor,

1683
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:23,610
but not for me.
There's also an extra douchey ness to 

1684
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:25,690
that place because it's in hollywood.
It's a famous iconic building,

1685
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:28,060
so you would get these people that were 
like,

1686
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:33,450
there's an extra level of douche that 
you get from people that are like in 

1687
01:14:33,641 --> 01:14:37,570
show business that are [inaudible] are 
trying to make it in show business.

1688
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:42,820
There's a lot of people that give 
attempts at show business and they're 

1689
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:45,220
really insane and it doesn't go well for
them and so they'll,

1690
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:50,800
they'll be at a comedy club and they'll 
see someone doing something and they 

1691
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:50,800
decide and they're insane,
have so good.

1692
01:14:50,830 --> 01:14:55,830
Not only that,
this guy ain't shit and I'm better than 

1693
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:55,830
him.
I can be funnier than him.

1694
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:55,870
Like I've heard people.
It was like,

1695
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,010
you're a mattress salesman.

1696
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:02,300
You don't do that anymore.
I've heard people that could be in a 

1697
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:02,410
comic or it could be an actor in their 
mind,

1698
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:06,040
but it's just this extra duty genus of 
people that are out here.

1699
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:11,360
You know what I mean?
It's like it's not an unchecked 

1700
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:11,360
juiciness that you don't find that often
in the east coast.

1701
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:14,020
The different kinds of duchamp's yeah.
Unchecked.

1702
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,390
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Yeah.

1703
01:15:15,391 --> 01:15:20,391
Nobody like,
they don't have friends that don't have 

1704
01:15:20,391 --> 01:15:20,391
people to go shut the fuck up in boston 
though.

1705
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:23,440
It was different kind of drunk.
If it's out of control,

1706
01:15:23,450 --> 01:15:26,640
just savages that they're there.
They're just like that.

1707
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:31,650
I've blocked out already to the 
descendants of wild savages that came 

1708
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:32,200
with here on boats before there were 
movies.

1709
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:37,550
We just stop and think about that.
They didn't know what the fuck was over 

1710
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:37,550
here.
These people were craZy.

1711
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:39,640
The genetics of the first irish that 
came to America,

1712
01:15:40,130 --> 01:15:44,500
but maniacs who the boats or fuck with 
that.

1713
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:49,770
Hey,
we're thinking about going on a boat to 

1714
01:15:49,770 --> 01:15:52,081
a place that we can't really describe 
because any photos or anything because 

1715
01:15:52,081 --> 01:15:54,100
they haven't invented cameras yet,
but it will take a few months.

1716
01:15:55,470 --> 01:15:59,080
We're going to take a few months and 
hopefully we will die of starvation.

1717
01:15:59,350 --> 01:16:00,730
And uh,
by the time we get there,

1718
01:16:00,731 --> 01:16:05,731
I mean,
hopefully the savages one eat your 

1719
01:16:05,731 --> 01:16:05,731
babies.
They won't shoot arrows into us.

1720
01:16:05,731 --> 01:16:07,360
Hopefully they will.
They will eat a lOt of your babies.

1721
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:08,530
No,
hopefully they won't.

1722
01:16:08,531 --> 01:16:13,531
You like your babies.
You don't want them get eaten otherwise 

1723
01:16:13,531 --> 01:16:13,531
you can't spread.
You see it across the country.

1724
01:16:13,531 --> 01:16:17,550
What's,
when did we make enemies with the 

1725
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:17,550
indians?
Why did they attack?

1726
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:17,550
And it just like steal the women and 
stuff.

1727
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:22,410
Listen,
everybody that lands in a country and 

1728
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:22,410
this country is an attacker.

1729
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:22,900
Yeah.
You know,

1730
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:24,550
you might not think of yourself as an 
attacker.

1731
01:16:24,551 --> 01:16:27,010
You think of yourself as a colonist,
but you're an attacker.

1732
01:16:27,011 --> 01:16:28,510
If you're running into people that were 
already there,

1733
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:31,000
you know,
and you can say,

1734
01:16:31,001 --> 01:16:31,480
well,
hey,

1735
01:16:31,481 --> 01:16:31,930
you know,
we,

1736
01:16:31,931 --> 01:16:33,910
they should make room for us to,
okay,

1737
01:16:33,911 --> 01:16:38,911
maybe.
But maybe they don't want to because 

1738
01:16:38,911 --> 01:16:38,911
there's.
Yeah.

1739
01:16:38,911 --> 01:16:41,740
And if you show any aggression to them 
and you taking food out of their 

1740
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:42,610
children are to get these things out of 
here.

1741
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:47,700
Yeah.
And then there was also the fucking 

1742
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:49,140
treaties that were broken and all the.
Here's some crimes,

1743
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:52,330
smallpox blankets for you all.
Yeah.

1744
01:16:52,331 --> 01:16:55,780
All the horrific crimes that were 
perpetrated on the american indian.

1745
01:16:55,781 --> 01:16:57,830
I mean,
god,

1746
01:16:57,850 --> 01:17:02,850
you starting to hear those stories and 
think about it and he hears about the 

1747
01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:05,710
slaughter and the fucking mass genocide 
and the,

1748
01:17:05,740 --> 01:17:07,890
just the numbers.
Yeah.

1749
01:17:08,050 --> 01:17:10,340
You know what Australia,
they're respectful

1750
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:14,000
of aboriginal people.
If one aboriginal kills another one,

1751
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:16,310
the white people don't deal with it.

1752
01:17:16,930 --> 01:17:19,370
You guys saw in you to deal with us.
You know,

1753
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:21,310
it freaked me out when they have their 
own justice system.

1754
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,280
Freaked me out when I was,
there was a,

1755
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:25,060
they were telling me about,
um,

1756
01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:30,090
during the fifties,
I guess it was where they had this 

1757
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:32,200
concerted effort.
They decided to take aboriginal children

1758
01:17:32,201 --> 01:17:37,201
from their parents,
steal them and raise them in the white 

1759
01:17:37,201 --> 01:17:37,201
world.
Oh.

1760
01:17:37,201 --> 01:17:38,410
Like to,
to help them to benefit them.

1761
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:42,640
So,
so craZy and dark.

1762
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:48,090
But the idea was that they were going to
try to civilize these people and the 

1763
01:17:48,090 --> 01:17:48,090
only way to do it would be the fucking 
kids.

1764
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:51,590
Like that was a real plan that was 
involved with that.

1765
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:52,480
Yeah,
man.

1766
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:55,000
They took their kids.
Oh wow.

1767
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:58,060
They took their kids because they 
believed that their culture was better.

1768
01:17:58,150 --> 01:18:00,240
So much better.
It's so good.

1769
01:18:00,730 --> 01:18:03,010
You don't think so.
That's so crazy.

1770
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:07,940
That's so crazy that people could take 
people's children.

1771
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:09,850
Yeah.

1772
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:11,270
It's so crazy.

1773
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:17,820
And you know,
apparently like they have a lot of the 

1774
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:20,671
same issues that american indians have 
with alcohol problems in their 

1775
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:21,730
communities.
Aboriginals.

1776
01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:22,960
Aborigines,
yeah.

1777
01:18:22,961 --> 01:18:27,040
The native americans.
I apparently it's a genetic issue with a

1778
01:18:27,041 --> 01:18:29,920
lot of them that they don't have long.
Yeah.

1779
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:33,970
Their ancestors didn't develop the 
tolerance and they weren't accustomed to

1780
01:18:33,971 --> 01:18:38,971
alcohol the way like europeans were.
So apparently aboriginal people in 

1781
01:18:39,161 --> 01:18:41,350
Australia had a similar problem.
So a lot of them,

1782
01:18:41,351 --> 01:18:43,900
there's a lot of alcoholism,
a lot of real problems with.

1783
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:46,270
I don't know if they ever had alcohol 
before,

1784
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:47,950
but they probably didn't have the shit 
that we have.

1785
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,640
Even if theY had their own alcohol,
if they didn't have wild Turkey,

1786
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:56,870
they didn't.
They dIdn't ever have any crazy 

1787
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:56,870
tequilas.
They didn't have some shifts.

1788
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:03,250
It might add some fermented berry juice 
that of gets you high if you leave it 

1789
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:03,730
out and chase off the flies.
Yeah,

1790
01:19:03,790 --> 01:19:06,970
but they were so arrogant that they 
thought it was okay to take their kids.

1791
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,370
Wow.
That's sell a mean horrible.

1792
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:12,280
Pulling a kid away from a mom.
Horrifying.

1793
01:19:12,370 --> 01:19:15,550
Terrifying.
The ugliest aspects of humanity.

1794
01:19:17,530 --> 01:19:18,400
Yeah.
I mean,

1795
01:19:18,401 --> 01:19:22,120
the thing I started thinking recently,
so I thought about Philip Morris,

1796
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:27,340
the tobacco companies,
and you think of their evil people like 

1797
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:29,030
trying to addict you even though they 
know it's already like bad for you,

1798
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:32,560
but they're not evil people.
TheY're just people that had a job there

1799
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:35,020
that are doing that stuff.
They're not.

1800
01:19:35,021 --> 01:19:40,021
These are all old men.
There's just people Who got a job and 

1801
01:19:40,021 --> 01:19:42,771
now they're still doing that job even 
though know it's terrible sort of.

1802
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:48,080
Someone has to make the decision to sell
cigarettes.

1803
01:19:48,170 --> 01:19:50,380
Yeah,
and you could easily just say,

1804
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:50,990
oh,
I'm not gonna.

1805
01:19:51,050 --> 01:19:52,010
I'm not gonna.
Take this job.

1806
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:54,980
Then the encountered from cigarettes are
going to be a thing of the past.

1807
01:19:54,981 --> 01:19:57,650
I think the shit that he's sucking on,
that kind of thing,

1808
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,480
it's going to make much more sense for 
people.

1809
01:19:59,481 --> 01:20:01,700
If that stops killing people,
why wouldn't they do it?

1810
01:20:01,701 --> 01:20:03,440
It's a nicotine distribution device.

1811
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:06,990
Definitely getting people into smoking 
these again now and then it's helping.

1812
01:20:07,290 --> 01:20:08,070
It's helping like

1813
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:13,070
the tobacco farms find a way to make 
money because they've all invested 

1814
01:20:13,070 --> 01:20:14,960
heavily in it because new people were 
actually getting hooked on justice,

1815
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:15,810
smoking,
nicotine.

1816
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:16,580
Now I've noticed

1817
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:20,960
what is the actual health of those 
friendships?

1818
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:24,330
Those are outlawed in New York now.
Really?

1819
01:20:24,370 --> 01:20:25,630
Yup.
Indoors,

1820
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:29,200
because they said I'm a secondhand 
smoke,

1821
01:20:29,201 --> 01:20:31,150
but he builds vapor,
but they said they put.

1822
01:20:31,151 --> 01:20:32,800
The problem is they put on their 
package.

1823
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:38,080
I'm safer than smoking cigarettes and 
then you have to prove that you can't 

1824
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,840
just say that you show me a study.
That is the problem.

1825
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:42,510
You do have to prove that,
you know,

1826
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:47,880
it's like some sort of like ses 
carcinogen or something where it falls 

1827
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:50,971
into the same category as cigarettes 
doesn't seem like that blue cigarettes 

1828
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:50,971
stuff.
It lingers.

1829
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:54,250
Mill lingers more like smoke.
I don't smell it though.

1830
01:20:54,730 --> 01:20:59,730
You definitely smell like.
Because how I found out about this 

1831
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:03,100
actual one,
this girl was smoking it and it smelled 

1832
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:03,100
like strawberries and I just walked by 
and like,

1833
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:05,900
what was that strawberry snatcher vagina
and shit,

1834
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:07,190
and then she showed it to me and I'm 
like,

1835
01:21:07,191 --> 01:21:08,180
all right,
I'm lending that,

1836
01:21:08,181 --> 01:21:09,660
but it does smell,
but yeah.

1837
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:14,720
And I can see if you don't like 
strawberry and then you walk around the 

1838
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:15,830
library yet.
But people with perfume and

1839
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:17,670
no,
there's nothing wrong with that smell.

1840
01:21:17,671 --> 01:21:20,100
You smell it.
I smell it when you just did it,

1841
01:21:20,101 --> 01:21:22,050
but it smells nice.
It's like a nice smell.

1842
01:21:22,051 --> 01:21:24,990
Smell like cigarettes.
Cigarettes are disgusting,

1843
01:21:24,991 --> 01:21:29,991
man.
You used to come into the car after you 

1844
01:21:29,991 --> 01:21:32,001
smoke cigarettes.
Brian would like pretend he wasn't 

1845
01:21:32,001 --> 01:21:33,861
smoking.
He wouldn't go stick to them in the 

1846
01:21:33,861 --> 01:21:33,861
cold.
Oh,

1847
01:21:33,861 --> 01:21:34,320
when you come you'd come into the car 
and we would all smell it.

1848
01:21:34,321 --> 01:21:35,940
Like,
oh dude,

1849
01:21:36,210 --> 01:21:39,600
that's nasty.
people don't like to hear that shit.

1850
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:41,940
People that smoke cigarettes especially.
Oh yeah.

1851
01:21:42,150 --> 01:21:43,590
They don't like to hear what.
You can't smell it.

1852
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:44,070
Okay,
fine.

1853
01:21:44,071 --> 01:21:46,740
I guess I made up the smell.
I just smelled so stinky,

1854
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:49,460
stinky in the cold and the cold.
Come in,

1855
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:52,060
stinky.
Fuck off a cigarette.

1856
01:21:52,061 --> 01:21:53,730
Smells stinky.
Fucking smell it.

1857
01:21:53,731 --> 01:21:56,010
It's gross.
It's bad for you to fucks.

1858
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:59,310
Wait.
No that it's bad for you.

1859
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:01,500
Don't do it.
Get it together.

1860
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:07,580
These will be better for that.
It'll probably will take off probably 

1861
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:07,580
with a cigarette in 10 years.
We'll probably out there,

1862
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:11,680
but this is the thing.
They say that nicotine is actually an 

1863
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:12,420
infect a,
an effective cognitive boost.

1864
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:17,750
It gives you like a little.
That was one of the things that Steven 

1865
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:19,020
King said when Stephen King stop smoking
cigarettes.

1866
01:22:19,021 --> 01:22:24,021
He said he really felt it.
He really felt the difference in these 

1867
01:22:24,021 --> 01:22:26,921
synapses firing his,
the way he described it and writing his 

1868
01:22:26,921 --> 01:22:28,220
books and nicotine as sort of a 
stimulating effect on,

1869
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:33,250
on,
on thinking and creativity for a lot of 

1870
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:33,250
people.
But it's the tar,

1871
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:33,650
the tobacco,
the kudzu.

1872
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:34,680
It's.
Well no,

1873
01:22:34,681 --> 01:22:37,030
it's a lot of the chemicals.
There's,

1874
01:22:37,290 --> 01:22:42,290
there's like 590 chemicals that they add
to cigarettes on top of the tobacco 

1875
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:43,840
itself.
All approved bar,

1876
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:48,860
lovely government,
but these insane chemicals are 

1877
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:50,820
essentially designed to change the 
flavor and to make more addictive.

1878
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:53,610
You know what to do with the nicotine.
They have a certain amount,

1879
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:58,640
they'll shoot it up real high like all 
of a sudden from five to seven and then 

1880
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:03,201
everyone has to smoke less cigarettes 
because it's like all of a sudden I get 

1881
01:23:03,201 --> 01:23:05,811
in too much,
so they always want to like half a 

1882
01:23:05,811 --> 01:23:07,071
cigarette or whatever and they're 
getting their fix of whatever they need 

1883
01:23:07,071 --> 01:23:07,071
and then they

1884
01:23:07,071 --> 01:23:07,510
plummeted.
Once you get used to that,

1885
01:23:07,511 --> 01:23:09,090
they plummeted down,
like to.

1886
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:14,400
Yeah,
and then you start smoking more because 

1887
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,281
he's not getting what you need.
Then they push it right back up to 

1888
01:23:16,281 --> 01:23:16,281
average again.
Wait a minute,

1889
01:23:16,281 --> 01:23:19,450
they variant but on occasion in order to
get you fucking more addicted.

1890
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:24,660
They do that.
Now that they already know it causes 

1891
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:27,541
death.
They're still trying to get you more 

1892
01:23:27,541 --> 01:23:27,541
addicted.
Well,

1893
01:23:27,541 --> 01:23:30,810
I didn't know that they can do that.
So they can vary the amount of nicotine 

1894
01:23:30,810 --> 01:23:30,810
that.
How do you know this is?

1895
01:23:30,810 --> 01:23:33,240
That's what a word on the street Is a 
motherfucker.

1896
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,570
That's what I've heard from smokers.
I think big jay told me that it's.

1897
01:23:36,660 --> 01:23:39,070
It's a dark business man,
that's for sure.

1898
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:41,890
Especially if you've ever seen anybody 
that's dying a cigarettes,

1899
01:23:42,490 --> 01:23:45,310
emphysema,
people that are dying of lung cancer.

1900
01:23:45,311 --> 01:23:49,510
I not.
I'm mike side of that though.

1901
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:52,330
Really?
He got a stage four tumor.

1902
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:55,720
That's when they found him dead and like
two weeks it wouldn't make any sense and

1903
01:23:55,721 --> 01:23:57,490
I'm going,
whoa.

1904
01:23:57,940 --> 01:24:00,910
Smoked a lot of cigarettes.
I smoke a lot of cigarettes.

1905
01:24:00,970 --> 01:24:05,970
Mike lacey from the comedy magic club 
was a team made you cry that time brian,

1906
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:10,540
who was telling you to stop smoking 
cigarettes?

1907
01:24:10,770 --> 01:24:12,840
I was like crying because he gets to you
dude.

1908
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:14,480
It's so nice.
Such a nice guy.

1909
01:24:14,810 --> 01:24:16,570
No,
we probably look at me.

1910
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:18,310
Look at me.
We care about you.

1911
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:21,820
We don't want you to tell you.
They want to know is legit.

1912
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:25,330
Beautiful person.
Girl at the same day or something.

1913
01:24:25,331 --> 01:24:30,331
I don't know.
Maybe your cat hurt its foot shoving 

1914
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:33,160
cigarettes directly into your veins.
You were opening up veins.

1915
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,480
Yeah,
I ripped.

1916
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:42,560
I can't fucking in any comfortable.
You bad cry pretty easily.

1917
01:24:44,101 --> 01:24:46,280
I almost cried the other day and it's 
just how many,

1918
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:51,390
what I'm drinking.
I think sometimes maybe what you're 

1919
01:24:51,390 --> 01:24:51,390
drinking when she cried.
Yeah.

1920
01:24:51,390 --> 01:24:53,680
If I drink too much Turkey,
that's why I need it in Turkey.

1921
01:24:53,681 --> 01:24:58,120
I start crying like it's just like 
somebody that body's breaking down,

1922
01:25:00,010 --> 01:25:03,270
stuff like that,
or I think about something you can drink

1923
01:25:03,310 --> 01:25:08,310
that much.
Wild Turkey body's breaking down just 

1924
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:08,310
slowly dying.
It's getting poisoned.

1925
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:09,330
It's moaning.
Like my,

1926
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:13,600
my old cat,
he had fireball.

1927
01:25:15,430 --> 01:25:16,590
Fireball.
Have you had fire?

1928
01:25:16,930 --> 01:25:18,400
It's been a while.
What is it?

1929
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:20,020
Have you had it?
That's like a cinnamony,

1930
01:25:20,021 --> 01:25:21,280
right?
What is it to.

1931
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:26,300
It's the shot that we used a used to be 
popular when I was in college and then 

1932
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:28,330
went away and they got near the time of 
gold slog or an aftershock,

1933
01:25:28,510 --> 01:25:33,510
like all these really weird,
but then it kind of went away and it 

1934
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:33,970
came back and they repackage it and 
everything.

1935
01:25:33,971 --> 01:25:36,460
NoW it's like everywhere you go 
everyone's drinking fireball,

1936
01:25:36,461 --> 01:25:38,050
but it's my new drink.
Savages,

1937
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:39,760
savages.
Each and every one of you.

1938
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:42,430
Cinnamon whiskey.
I wanted to talk to you guys about this.

1939
01:25:42,431 --> 01:25:43,910
A jerry seinfeld.
Oh yeah,

1940
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:46,330
pull this up brian.
Pull it up.

1941
01:25:46,331 --> 01:25:49,360
It's on gawker.
Gawker.com.

1942
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:52,600
G a w k e r,
just pull up gawker.

1943
01:25:53,310 --> 01:25:58,310
It's like right on the front page.
It's who cares about diversity in 

1944
01:25:58,310 --> 01:25:58,310
comedy?
Says jerry seinfeld.

1945
01:25:58,350 --> 01:26:00,550
Oh yeah,
that's a,

1946
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:02,710
that's not what you want.
Just look up,

1947
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:03,840
look up.
Uh,

1948
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:08,840
just do a google search on the title 
diversity.

1949
01:26:08,870 --> 01:26:12,210
Jerry seinfeld and he's getting just 
gawker diversity journey.

1950
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:13,940
Doing a public interview.
Yeah.

1951
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:19,090
And people around.
I don't want to comment on it until we 

1952
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:19,640
actually pull the video up because I 
would like you to hear it from him first

1953
01:26:19,641 --> 01:26:23,180
before we,
even before we even comment on it,

1954
01:26:23,190 --> 01:26:23,920
because it's,
it's a,

1955
01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:26,510
it's an important subject for guys like 
ari and I,

1956
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:28,160
you know,
as,

1957
01:26:28,161 --> 01:26:31,010
as comics,
there's some shit that they're trying to

1958
01:26:31,011 --> 01:26:32,930
attach to this here

1959
01:26:33,550 --> 01:26:34,880
of 22 episodes.
Yeah,

1960
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:37,220
got fucked up.

1961
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:42,910
I have noticed that most of the guests 
are mostly white males.

1962
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:45,370
Have 22 episodes that you can get into 
that.

1963
01:26:45,430 --> 01:26:49,480
No,
but you take a look over here.

1964
01:26:49,481 --> 01:26:50,680
Peter,
what do you see?

1965
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:55,720
Yeah,
a lOt of what's going on here.

1966
01:26:57,390 --> 01:26:58,580
But,
oh,

1967
01:26:58,590 --> 01:27:02,670
this really pisses me off,
but really pisses me off.

1968
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:03,710
Well,
that's okay.

1969
01:27:03,711 --> 01:27:04,530
Um,
go ahead.

1970
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:09,950
But you made a comment on the tina fey 
episode that I thought was interesting 

1971
01:27:09,950 --> 01:27:12,981
that I,
I'd like to get your thoughts on a 

1972
01:27:12,981 --> 01:27:12,981
little bit more.
You said you were talking to her to that

1973
01:27:12,981 --> 01:27:14,700
and you said something about the female 
comedians.

1974
01:27:14,701 --> 01:27:19,701
It's a struggle for them to balance 
their feminine projections with their 

1975
01:27:19,701 --> 01:27:21,960
comedic gold in this context of comedy,
not gender diverse.

1976
01:27:21,961 --> 01:27:23,430
I just want to know what you meant by 
that.

1977
01:27:23,490 --> 01:27:28,490
Well,
I was kind of curious what it's like to 

1978
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:29,010
be a woman in comedy as opposed to a 
man.

1979
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:34,010
There was a little bit of a difference 
and I thought that might be an 

1980
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:34,010
interesting thing to discuss from her 
perspective.

1981
01:27:34,110 --> 01:27:37,800
She saw successful at it and I'm just 
wondering how she looked at it,

1982
01:27:37,801 --> 01:27:41,220
if she even thought about it and she 
kind of gave me the answer,

1983
01:27:41,221 --> 01:27:43,650
which is yeah,
you do have to think about that,

1984
01:27:43,651 --> 01:27:45,960
but you know,
it's just another thing to think about.

1985
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:46,890
Okay.
All right,

1986
01:27:46,950 --> 01:27:48,210
fair enough.
Now you,

1987
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:53,240
there were a lot of things about the 
comedians of cars in the beginning of 

1988
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:54,440
the first 10 I did.
I think we're all white males and people

1989
01:27:54,450 --> 01:27:56,230
writing all about that,
which I,

1990
01:27:56,250 --> 01:28:01,250
part of the reason why I had people had 
tweeted at me when I said I'm 

1991
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:04,071
interviewing with jerry seinfeld.
I'll ask him about their gender 

1992
01:28:04,071 --> 01:28:04,071
diversity on this.
I mean,

1993
01:28:04,071 --> 01:28:08,690
it's,
people think it's the census or 

1994
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:09,160
something.
I may represent the,

1995
01:28:09,161 --> 01:28:12,390
the actual pie chart of,
of America.

1996
01:28:12,391 --> 01:28:14,220
Who cares?
It's just funnY.

1997
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,140
Funny is,
is the,

1998
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:19,050
is the world that I live in.
You're funny.

1999
01:28:19,051 --> 01:28:20,310
I'm interested.
You're not funny.

2000
01:28:20,311 --> 01:28:25,311
I'm not interested and I have no 
interest in gender or race or anything 

2001
01:28:25,531 --> 01:28:30,531
like that,
but everyone else is kind of with their 

2002
01:28:30,531 --> 01:28:32,040
little calculating.
Is this the exact right mix?

2003
01:28:32,370 --> 01:28:33,240
You know?
Uh,

2004
01:28:33,270 --> 01:28:34,980
I,
I think that's a,

2005
01:28:35,730 --> 01:28:39,330
to me it's anti comedy.
It's comedy,

2006
01:28:39,730 --> 01:28:41,410
it's more about,
you know,

2007
01:28:41,670 --> 01:28:45,480
pc nonsense.
Then are you making us laugh or not?

2008
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:46,140
Right,
right.

2009
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:50,590
Yeah.
Well they went off on that so that See,

2010
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,460
it shows that he's like racist.
Well,

2011
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:54,300
I saw people,
uh,

2012
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:56,420
I saw a video on don't even want to 
bring it up.

2013
01:28:56,421 --> 01:29:01,421
I don't even Want to pull the video up 
because I don't want to watch it again 

2014
01:29:01,421 --> 01:29:01,421
because it was so annoying.
Uh,

2015
01:29:01,421 --> 01:29:02,820
people that were taking that and saying 
that that's a problem.

2016
01:29:03,030 --> 01:29:05,830
They're taking that and he's not saying 
all,

2017
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:09,610
I don't care if he's saying I don't,
I only care about what's funny,

2018
01:29:09,670 --> 01:29:13,500
trying to make things funny and he's not
concerned about making them diverse.

2019
01:29:13,501 --> 01:29:16,350
It's like if you think about with 
mustaches on your show,

2020
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:17,910
because I wasn't even thinking about 
that,

2021
01:29:17,970 --> 01:29:22,970
that's what he said.
And you should be able to do creatively 

2022
01:29:22,970 --> 01:29:25,551
whatever you want,
especially when your goal is just make 

2023
01:29:25,551 --> 01:29:25,551
stuff funny.
Like why should he have to.

2024
01:29:25,551 --> 01:29:30,440
I mean if you,
if I watch a show with all koreans in 

2025
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:33,561
it,
I don't get upset that there's no white 

2026
01:29:33,561 --> 01:29:33,561
people say that.
Well,

2027
01:29:33,561 --> 01:29:37,580
you know what,
that's just because you're white and 

2028
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:39,351
you're privileged and there's an overall
problem maybe of not using enough black 

2029
01:29:39,961 --> 01:29:41,670
people are not using enough people of 
color,

2030
01:29:41,730 --> 01:29:44,130
but that's not each individual shoots 
problem.

2031
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,120
Well,
It's,

2032
01:29:46,610 --> 01:29:50,820
it's not the best thing about this world
that you know,

2033
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:52,800
there's racism,
it's one of the worst things,

2034
01:29:52,801 --> 01:29:57,801
right?
It's not the best thing about our 

2035
01:29:57,801 --> 01:29:57,801
culture that,
you know,

2036
01:29:57,801 --> 01:29:58,680
we aren't equally represented in the 
media.

2037
01:29:58,830 --> 01:30:00,960
It's not the best thing when you have 
to,

2038
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,240
you know,
you have to factor in populations,

2039
01:30:03,241 --> 01:30:04,800
you have to factor in,
you know,

2040
01:30:04,801 --> 01:30:09,801
how long the,
these people who have been in the 

2041
01:30:09,801 --> 01:30:11,931
business,
how long these people have been in the 

2042
01:30:11,931 --> 01:30:11,931
business.
A lot of shit going on.

2043
01:30:11,931 --> 01:30:12,270
When you talk about putting a fucking 
show on television,

2044
01:30:12,271 --> 01:30:17,271
a lot of people think that once someone 
gets into a position where they have a 

2045
01:30:17,271 --> 01:30:20,241
successful show,
then on top of having to create that 

2046
01:30:20,241 --> 01:30:23,301
show,
they also have an obligation to be 

2047
01:30:23,301 --> 01:30:25,251
diverse because they're representing 
America and they're supposed to like 

2048
01:30:25,251 --> 01:30:28,590
give opportunities to like a equal 
percentage of the population.

2049
01:30:29,310 --> 01:30:30,360
For that story.
Storyteller show,

2050
01:30:30,361 --> 01:30:35,361
this is where it's a problem because no 
know what you should be able to do what 

2051
01:30:35,361 --> 01:30:39,411
you're not talking about.
Like sOme government position we're 

2052
01:30:39,411 --> 01:30:40,410
talking about is a creative thing that 
you're making.

2053
01:30:40,411 --> 01:30:45,411
You should,
if you are comfortable doing it only 

2054
01:30:45,411 --> 01:30:48,111
with black people,
you should only deal with black people 

2055
01:30:48,111 --> 01:30:48,111
if then,
because they're probably like,

2056
01:30:48,111 --> 01:30:48,510
well,
I asked like four or five girls.

2057
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:50,910
None of them could do it,
so I did my part.

2058
01:30:51,210 --> 01:30:52,430
what am I suppose to get somebody worse?

2059
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:53,730
Just because,
yeah,

2060
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:56,220
it's ridiculous.
You should especially like that.

2061
01:30:56,221 --> 01:31:01,221
Like the storyteller type thing.
You should get whoever you think is 

2062
01:31:01,221 --> 01:31:01,221
good.
It's your show things that you think are

2063
01:31:01,221 --> 01:31:02,970
interesting,
but I know you.

2064
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:07,380
So I know if you find a woman who's a 
gay black,

2065
01:31:07,510 --> 01:31:12,510
uh,
there's not that many black seven foot 

2066
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:15,501
tall woman and she's really funny.
You're fucking lover and you'll start 

2067
01:31:15,501 --> 01:31:18,660
talking about our gracious.
If she's a five foot nine white girl,

2068
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:21,180
you know who's really cute,
but she's really hilarious.

2069
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:26,270
You'll say she's really hilarious.
I know you don't give a shit about 

2070
01:31:26,270 --> 01:31:28,821
anything funny.
So just one of the reasons why I wanted 

2071
01:31:28,821 --> 01:31:28,821
to play this when you're here because 
it's like,

2072
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:31,770
thIs is what you should be focused on,
but they're tricking him.

2073
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:35,190
They're setup question.
It is a setup question because it's a.

2074
01:31:35,210 --> 01:31:40,210
It's a kind of a goofy,
you know what he's trying to do when 

2075
01:31:40,210 --> 01:31:44,211
he's trying to make a good council.
He's also pretty much most of that show 

2076
01:31:44,211 --> 01:31:48,290
is him in a car getting coffee with his 
friend and look,

2077
01:31:48,331 --> 01:31:49,990
this clicks.
Yeah.

2078
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:55,120
We'll have the people that hang out with
and there's not that many black comics 

2079
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:55,120
at the clubs.
There's nothIng wrong with it.

2080
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:59,420
That's the point.
It's just who he is and who his friends 

2081
01:31:59,420 --> 01:31:59,420
are.
Yeah.

2082
01:31:59,420 --> 01:31:59,420
He did a shoW with those four people,
so we're going to have them on.

2083
01:32:00,290 --> 01:32:05,290
We're going to force a black guy and 
it's like it just have in this mostly 

2084
01:32:05,290 --> 01:32:06,290
his friends and look what happens when 
they had chris rock on.

2085
01:32:06,330 --> 01:32:07,930
They got pulled over,
so it's just.

2086
01:32:08,710 --> 01:32:13,710
Yeah,
at the end of their rope instead they 

2087
01:32:13,710 --> 01:32:14,940
got pulled over.
He should be able to do whatever the 

2088
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:14,940
fuck you want.
It's his thing,

2089
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:19,090
you know,
he shouldn't be able to do whatever he 

2090
01:32:19,090 --> 01:32:19,090
wants,
but you know,

2091
01:32:19,090 --> 01:32:21,301
the idea that you should even debating 
that he's got issues because what he 

2092
01:32:21,301 --> 01:32:26,101
wants is different than when you.
Because it doesn't represent the exact 

2093
01:32:26,101 --> 01:32:26,101
numbers,
so he had three out of 20.

2094
01:32:26,101 --> 01:32:27,790
If you have five out of 20,
would have been okay.

2095
01:32:27,910 --> 01:32:30,490
Nothing wrong with sex and the city.
There's nothing wrong with the show them

2096
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:32,550
that is wrong.
No.

2097
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:35,050
If you're a woman and you were in your 
forties when that shit came out,

2098
01:32:35,051 --> 01:32:35,560
you would love it.

2099
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:39,310
It's just wrong for ari shaffir,
but for them,

2100
01:32:39,470 --> 01:32:40,710
nothing wrong.
Women in entertainment,

2101
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:43,210
if it's bunch of women doing shit for 
women,

2102
01:32:43,211 --> 01:32:45,610
they should be able to cast whatever 
women they want to cast.

2103
01:32:45,910 --> 01:32:47,950
It shouldn't be a man that steps up and 
says,

2104
01:32:47,951 --> 01:32:52,951
hey,
my favorite use about left on 

2105
01:32:52,951 --> 01:32:52,951
television,
saw it was a billboard of a girl.

2106
01:32:52,951 --> 01:32:57,721
Hold the gun up and another girl hold 
another gun up and then another guy 

2107
01:32:57,721 --> 01:32:57,860
behind her,
like in the force also and you're like,

2108
01:32:58,450 --> 01:33:00,250
what is that?
Lifetime television.

2109
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:05,350
It's like scifi for women like tHis 
could never exist.

2110
01:33:05,351 --> 01:33:06,580
Yeah.
What are you talking about?

2111
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:10,630
You're hot and you're leaving the squad 
and the guys behind you.

2112
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:14,520
It's just accepting that role is like 
psi phi for women.

2113
01:33:14,770 --> 01:33:19,770
It is.
Wouldn't it be awesome with the world 

2114
01:33:19,770 --> 01:33:19,770
was like this?
Yeah,

2115
01:33:19,770 --> 01:33:22,411
they.
There was a few of those fucking silly 

2116
01:33:22,411 --> 01:33:22,411
movies,
but that's okay for them,

2117
01:33:22,411 --> 01:33:22,411
man.

2118
01:33:22,411 --> 01:33:22,930
If that's what they want,
it's okay.

2119
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,600
If that's what they want.
Black entertainment is so bad.

2120
01:33:26,390 --> 01:33:29,680
So bad.
What you need them is fucking garbage.

2121
01:33:29,681 --> 01:33:31,390
You mean like Tyler Perry?
is that what you trying to say?

2122
01:33:31,430 --> 01:33:32,310
Yes,
absolutely.

2123
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:34,360
THat's one.
That's what all of it's so bad.

2124
01:33:34,361 --> 01:33:39,361
Have you ever seen like the cw,
the black shows which shows whatever 

2125
01:33:39,361 --> 01:33:42,361
they are over the years,
but we showed up to the wayans brothers 

2126
01:33:42,361 --> 01:33:44,380
to whatever with the wayans brothers.
It's just bad entertainment.

2127
01:33:44,381 --> 01:33:46,990
They're offering them.
THey never offer them anything of value.

2128
01:33:47,070 --> 01:33:48,640
You say them like there's some other 
people.

2129
01:33:48,641 --> 01:33:50,170
Yeah.
They offer that group.

2130
01:33:50,171 --> 01:33:54,310
The blacks,
the blacks,

2131
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:56,860
all their fucking black comedy movies.
Just like,

2132
01:33:56,861 --> 01:33:59,440
what is this soul plane?
It's just goofy.

2133
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:01,990
Well,
with Robert Townsend.

2134
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:04,360
Yeah.
remember he used to deal with shuffling.

2135
01:34:04,810 --> 01:34:07,630
He did some really cool,
funny movies that would happen to people

2136
01:34:07,631 --> 01:34:08,170
like that.

2137
01:34:08,710 --> 01:34:09,910
How many?
Like when?

2138
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:15,000
It's really interesting because there's 
like a bunch of known a white comedy 

2139
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,991
directors.
Judd apatow guys who produce phillips of

2140
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:22,620
white,
top phillips,

2141
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:23,830
one of those.
Yeah.

2142
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:27,460
They're producing like white comedies,
hilarious white comedies.

2143
01:34:27,550 --> 01:34:29,470
You don't hear about a lot of black guys
that are doing that.

2144
01:34:29,471 --> 01:34:30,380
It's so true.
Yeah,

2145
01:34:30,490 --> 01:34:33,100
but aren't they white comedies or are 
they just comedies?

2146
01:34:33,310 --> 01:34:38,310
Well,
they're not because craig robinson was 

2147
01:34:38,310 --> 01:34:38,310
on a lot of them.
Yeah,

2148
01:34:38,310 --> 01:34:38,310
that's true.
That's true.

2149
01:34:38,310 --> 01:34:40,870
He was awesome and this is the end.
He was really good in that.

2150
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:41,540
Fuck.
Yeah,

2151
01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:46,550
he was.
I liked the part of michael cera got 

2152
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:46,600
sabbath and somebody took my cell phone,
started ringing his backpack.

2153
01:34:46,630 --> 01:34:47,050
It's like,
oh,

2154
01:34:47,051 --> 01:34:51,610
that's really embarrassing.
That was a funny movie,

2155
01:34:51,611 --> 01:34:53,390
man.
When kenny powers came in,

2156
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:55,480
that's when it became the most awesome 
movie ever.

2157
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:58,010
He's such a dickhead.
He started washing is good with

2158
01:34:58,020 --> 01:35:03,020
their fucking whatever water they had 
remaining small amount of water,

2159
01:35:03,870 --> 01:35:05,280
but again,
I mean,

2160
01:35:05,290 --> 01:35:09,140
you should be able to make a show with 
whoever you want to make a show.

2161
01:35:09,141 --> 01:35:11,120
It doesn't make you a racist.
Right?

2162
01:35:11,150 --> 01:35:16,150
It's irrelevant.
The terms you're talking about have 

2163
01:35:16,150 --> 01:35:16,150
nothing to do with that world,
that world.

2164
01:35:16,150 --> 01:35:17,240
That's what he said.
It exists in funny,

2165
01:35:17,510 --> 01:35:19,370
that's it,
that's all that matters,

2166
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:24,430
but the idea that you should have 
affirmative action and comedy that you 

2167
01:35:24,430 --> 01:35:25,790
should then that's essentially what 
they're saying.

2168
01:35:25,791 --> 01:35:28,580
They're saying that you should have to 
have x amount of women.

2169
01:35:28,581 --> 01:35:30,230
You should have to have x amount of 
black people.

2170
01:35:30,231 --> 01:35:31,400
if you don't,
they're saying,

2171
01:35:31,401 --> 01:35:33,200
wait a minute,
do you have just a lot of white friends?

2172
01:35:33,230 --> 01:35:36,800
But then the problem is then you're 
making female comedy worse.

2173
01:35:37,070 --> 01:35:39,710
You're makiNg it worse for advancing 
people without merit.

2174
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,770
Making it overall worse while you can.

2175
01:35:42,890 --> 01:35:44,480
Most certainly,
you know,

2176
01:35:44,510 --> 01:35:49,510
the other argument would be that he just
doesn't hang out in those cliques so he 

2177
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:53,801
doesn't know these funny women and it 
would benefit everybody if he got to 

2178
01:35:53,801 --> 01:35:54,530
know them and had them on.
I could see that argument.

2179
01:35:54,531 --> 01:35:59,531
Maybe if there was like a pool of talent
that you knew that was really fucking 

2180
01:35:59,531 --> 01:36:01,700
crackling that you wanted to have on 
your show,

2181
01:36:01,701 --> 01:36:04,730
but at the end of the day it's who he 
wants to talk to.

2182
01:36:04,910 --> 01:36:07,370
Like when people say to me like,
why did you have a big foot expert on?

2183
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:12,620
Because I want to fucking talk to him.
I don't know why do you have a 

2184
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:15,881
bowhunting expert on?
Because I want to talk to a bowhunting 

2185
01:36:15,881 --> 01:36:15,881
expert.
Okay.

2186
01:36:15,881 --> 01:36:16,160
This is interesting.
You don't have to listen,

2187
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:18,140
you know,
but if you want to,

2188
01:36:18,230 --> 01:36:23,230
uh,
I will do my best to try to make it 

2189
01:36:23,230 --> 01:36:23,780
entertaining and I will try to ask the 
questions that I have.

2190
01:36:23,990 --> 01:36:27,130
I will try to explore as objectively and
thoroughly.

2191
01:36:27,150 --> 01:36:29,690
But that's my perspective and my point 
of view.

2192
01:36:29,980 --> 01:36:30,490
So I mean,
how,

2193
01:36:30,610 --> 01:36:32,030
I mean,
somebody asked me the other day like how

2194
01:36:32,031 --> 01:36:34,030
many gay people we had on,
I don't know,

2195
01:36:34,070 --> 01:36:35,570
like three or four or something like 
that.

2196
01:36:35,571 --> 01:36:40,571
Like maybe melissa etheridge,
todd glass martindale.

2197
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:43,840
Who else?
We had some other ones out.

2198
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:45,610
Somebody.
Yeah.

2199
01:36:47,940 --> 01:36:49,870
Well whoever the fuck it was,
um,

2200
01:36:50,330 --> 01:36:52,280
you know,
and someone was like,

2201
01:36:52,281 --> 01:36:54,560
well why haven't you had more?
Whatever.

2202
01:36:54,830 --> 01:36:56,120
Who cares?
Like,

2203
01:36:56,121 --> 01:36:58,910
why,
why do I have to now I don't want to.

2204
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:00,950
How about that?
Now you're bringing up.

2205
01:37:00,951 --> 01:37:01,920
I'm annoyed,
you know?

2206
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:07,240
But then it's also like,
am I just not friends enough with black 

2207
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:07,730
people or gay people?
This man,

2208
01:37:07,790 --> 01:37:09,110
anybody.
I find interesting.

2209
01:37:09,111 --> 01:37:14,111
I'll talk to.
I give zero fuckS about what they look 

2210
01:37:14,111 --> 01:37:14,111
like.
I don't care.

2211
01:37:14,111 --> 01:37:15,830
I don't care if someone's black or white
or fat or skinny.

2212
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,420
If they're interesting.
They're interesting.

2213
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:19,610
I don't care.
I really don't.

2214
01:37:19,611 --> 01:37:21,380
I don't care what your kind of music you
like.

2215
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:22,630
I don't give a fuck.
It doesn't.

2216
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:25,550
I'm not judgmental on that stuff.
please don't talk to anybody.

2217
01:37:25,670 --> 01:37:28,620
I'm sweatpants in it to jeff's son.
I'm into it.

2218
01:37:28,820 --> 01:37:33,770
I'm sweatpants in it with a jacket 
jacket on,

2219
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:36,860
fat fanny back with my higher primate 
logo.

2220
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:39,410
Have you seen the higher primates?
Fanny pack rat.

2221
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:41,750
So sexy,
sexy.

2222
01:37:41,751 --> 01:37:43,010
Once you see it,
you'll unDerstand.

2223
01:37:43,011 --> 01:37:47,000
My passion was government eventually 
will have purses,

2224
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:52,480
but until then the higher primate fanny 
pack the shaft on the of that sign.

2225
01:37:53,860 --> 01:37:55,590
Actually that beautiful leather.
Look at the front.

2226
01:37:55,591 --> 01:37:56,190
See that little

2227
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:58,210
higher primate logo,
so it's.

2228
01:37:58,590 --> 01:38:01,270
Yeah,
it's a monkey with a chimp rather with a

2229
01:38:01,271 --> 01:38:03,330
light bulb.
I was sad like I got an idea.

2230
01:38:03,570 --> 01:38:08,570
First idea,
the first idea because that's the first 

2231
01:38:08,570 --> 01:38:08,970
step.
A curious chimp.

2232
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:12,810
We used to always look at these charts,
the comedy store to see who got what.

2233
01:38:12,950 --> 01:38:17,950
Rosa,
who's hire private was a few we didn't 

2234
01:38:17,950 --> 01:38:17,950
know.
That's not my company.

2235
01:38:17,950 --> 01:38:17,950
My company's.
Well,

2236
01:38:17,950 --> 01:38:19,380
I can't tell you it shouldn't take it 
online.

2237
01:38:19,850 --> 01:38:23,190
Well,
everybody keep it together.

2238
01:38:24,510 --> 01:38:26,010
But uh,
the um,

2239
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:29,740
the higher primate fanny pack,
it's just the beginning from there.

2240
01:38:29,741 --> 01:38:31,530
I'm on my last launch,
a bunch of other get up.

2241
01:38:31,550 --> 01:38:36,550
She me off.
You see what natasha did when she had a 

2242
01:38:36,550 --> 01:38:36,550
thing for new year's eve?
Yes,

2243
01:38:36,550 --> 01:38:36,860
yes.
Yeah.

2244
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:40,140
People are mad at her and she made up.
There's no reason to get mad.

2245
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:45,440
It's so dumb.
And she made the best apology you could 

2246
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:45,440
ever make.

2247
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:45,670
It was perfect.
It was like,

2248
01:38:46,270 --> 01:38:47,280
sorry.
You misunderstood it.

2249
01:38:47,340 --> 01:38:48,990
Their old,
their teeth fall out when they're old.

2250
01:38:48,991 --> 01:38:49,770
That's the joke.
Well,

2251
01:38:49,771 --> 01:38:51,130
not only that,
she was like,

2252
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:53,640
she was pretty clear that she was just 
joking around,

2253
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:58,700
you know,
it's pretty obvious that it was just 

2254
01:38:58,700 --> 01:39:01,730
real.
Veterans are being mistreated as they 

2255
01:39:01,730 --> 01:39:01,730
come home.
Now that's the issue.

2256
01:39:01,730 --> 01:39:01,980
You should worry about if you want to 
honor the veterans.

2257
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:05,300
It's a joke and it's not that people 
were really upset.

2258
01:39:05,301 --> 01:39:10,301
Is it that people think that they have 
the license to be upset and then they 

2259
01:39:10,301 --> 01:39:10,920
can get you in trouble now what I was 
trying to do,

2260
01:39:10,921 --> 01:39:13,890
they're trying to get you in trouble.
what I was just trying to change things.

2261
01:39:14,010 --> 01:39:16,090
They're trying to get you in trouble,
in trouble.

2262
01:39:16,110 --> 01:39:16,710
They can feel.
Yeah,

2263
01:39:16,711 --> 01:39:20,480
they can contact the network so you 
should do something with this.

2264
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,120
Like you don't have anybody in your 
family that says something that dumb.

2265
01:39:24,121 --> 01:39:29,121
Occasionally they missed one.
You know they go for a little old 

2266
01:39:29,121 --> 01:39:32,151
person.
JOy when vengeance and I deserved 

2267
01:39:32,151 --> 01:39:32,151
vengeance.
She should be fired.

2268
01:39:32,151 --> 01:39:33,330
If an opposite of a drama is not any 
good,

2269
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:38,100
you can't fire anybody.
That's what I want to see as if it's not

2270
01:39:38,101 --> 01:39:41,220
such an innocuous joke.
If it actually is a borderline like rape

2271
01:39:41,221 --> 01:39:46,221
or murder or pedophile joke where it's 
not completely nothing and it's not a 

2272
01:39:46,221 --> 01:39:49,581
cute woman doing the non-apology.
I want to see how people get that or 

2273
01:39:49,581 --> 01:39:49,890
people like chris rock or plus out 
again,

2274
01:39:50,190 --> 01:39:52,980
tracy morgan and just do a one 80 and go
from like.

2275
01:39:52,981 --> 01:39:54,210
No,
you can say whatever he wants to.

2276
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:54,990
Well,
all right.

2277
01:39:54,991 --> 01:39:56,610
You go too far.
So what happened?

2278
01:39:57,150 --> 01:39:57,690
Chris rock,
awkward.

2279
01:39:57,691 --> 01:39:59,040
TracY morgan to have that thing with the
case.

2280
01:39:59,070 --> 01:40:01,770
He said he went too faR.
it just totally flipped as well.

2281
01:40:01,771 --> 01:40:04,410
There's certain.
Wow.

2282
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:08,100
There's certain things that you feel 
like you can't fucking endorse.

2283
01:40:08,190 --> 01:40:10,650
Yeah.
That lack kind of gay bashing,

2284
01:40:10,651 --> 01:40:15,060
like saying that he would stab his,
his son if his son was gay.

2285
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:17,640
People can endorse that.
I can endorse that,

2286
01:40:17,790 --> 01:40:22,050
but if you know tracy morgan forever,
it's what he does.

2287
01:40:22,051 --> 01:40:27,051
He says ridiculously outrageous shit 
that he doesn't really mean and now 

2288
01:40:27,051 --> 01:40:27,720
because it's popular,
we're going to go against it.

2289
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:30,990
You caN't eat wants.
You know what he's doing.

2290
01:40:30,991 --> 01:40:35,991
Everybody knows what he's doing.
It's like a joke to pretend that he's 

2291
01:40:35,991 --> 01:40:37,200
not saying something completely 
outrageous,

2292
01:40:37,201 --> 01:40:40,140
that he absolutely doesn't matter how 
old you are,

2293
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:42,230
how old you want.
Oh,

2294
01:40:42,810 --> 01:40:46,970
you must be fast.
Fast.

2295
01:40:48,380 --> 01:40:50,370
My piece low.
Yeah.

2296
01:40:50,371 --> 01:40:54,190
He rubs his belly,
so we'll get pregnant who slap his belly

2297
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:56,670
on that tv,
show someone getting pregnant tonight to

2298
01:40:57,550 --> 01:40:59,450
someone getting pregnant,
you know,

2299
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:04,470
that's his whole thing was a real room 
that he couldn't read a real legitimate 

2300
01:41:04,470 --> 01:41:04,840
rumor that people are telling charlie 
barnett couldn't read.

2301
01:41:04,841 --> 01:41:06,490
That's how he couldN't get on the 
saturday night live.

2302
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:07,470
Really?
Yeah.

2303
01:41:07,610 --> 01:41:12,610
Charlie barnett was.
Chris was shaped chappelle's teacher 

2304
01:41:12,610 --> 01:41:15,250
that's mentor him and a lot of other 
guys.

2305
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:19,510
When I was in New York,
he was already not there anymore.

2306
01:41:19,660 --> 01:41:21,420
I don't know where he was.
He died,

2307
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:23,110
died of aids,
I believe.

2308
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:26,010
um,
but he was a,

2309
01:41:26,050 --> 01:41:31,050
like a guy who was dave chappelle.
He sort of taught dave chappelle had to 

2310
01:41:31,050 --> 01:41:31,050
do,
um,

2311
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:34,660
that those street side shows.
I think I might be talking to school,

2312
01:41:34,661 --> 01:41:36,910
but I have seen dave chappelle do a 
street side show.

2313
01:41:37,150 --> 01:41:42,150
Dave chappelle in montreal.
It was pretty hilarious when he was 

2314
01:41:42,150 --> 01:41:42,250
really young too,
is when I first met him.

2315
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:47,430
I think he was probably like,
I first met him in New York and then I 

2316
01:41:47,430 --> 01:41:47,990
saw him again up in montreal when he was
like,

2317
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:51,130
maybe like 19 sit on the side.
He took his hat off,

2318
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:56,160
put his hat on the ground and did a 
comedy show and then pass the hat 

2319
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:56,160
around.
Wow.

2320
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:59,200
And people put money in it.
It was before he was famous and he would

2321
01:41:59,201 --> 01:42:02,530
just do it at the drop of a hat.
Just do javelin notice.

2322
01:42:02,890 --> 01:42:05,290
Just when he was funny.
It was good.

2323
01:42:05,291 --> 01:42:07,780
He would kick cassius developed to get 
the crowd.

2324
01:42:07,781 --> 01:42:11,790
Like he must've developed certain things
in order to get them to gather around.

2325
01:42:12,370 --> 01:42:14,380
I think he would just call them around 
and you know,

2326
01:42:14,381 --> 01:42:18,280
he looks like a guy who would be fun to 
listen to the talk so people slow down,

2327
01:42:18,281 --> 01:42:18,920
you know,
some,

2328
01:42:18,940 --> 01:42:20,740
some folks are in a hurry and some folks
aren't.

2329
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:25,840
And the ones that aren't,
they circle them and then he'll do like 

2330
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:26,320
a little five minute comedy show and 
then pass a hat around.

2331
01:42:26,321 --> 01:42:31,321
I saw him do it in montreal.
Well apparently charlie barnett used to 

2332
01:42:31,321 --> 01:42:31,420
do that and he was like legendary out.
It was awesome.

2333
01:42:31,450 --> 01:42:34,330
He was awesome at like being hilarious 
to a bunch of people,

2334
01:42:34,331 --> 01:42:36,340
like off the cuff,
he had material that he would do,

2335
01:42:36,341 --> 01:42:39,150
but they will also be off the cuff funny
and he would gather people around.

2336
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:41,230
Then he would hand out of the hat,
pass out the hat,

2337
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:43,690
you know,
and that's how he would make some money.

2338
01:42:43,930 --> 01:42:47,200
And uh,
he became famous,

2339
01:42:47,201 --> 01:42:49,660
like doing comedy,
did a lot of standup people,

2340
01:42:49,661 --> 01:42:54,661
loved him onstage and then he got an 
audition for saturday night live and 

2341
01:42:54,661 --> 01:42:56,500
apparently the word was that he got the 
part but he couldn't read.

2342
01:42:56,710 --> 01:42:58,700
So since he couldn't read scripts,
they couldn't hire them.

2343
01:42:58,730 --> 01:43:03,730
That's tough.
The working environment without being 

2344
01:43:03,730 --> 01:43:03,730
able to route.
And apparently he had a,

2345
01:43:03,730 --> 01:43:06,640
he had a problem with intravenous drugs 
and he loved them.

2346
01:43:07,050 --> 01:43:08,440
Yeah.
He found out about them.

2347
01:43:08,530 --> 01:43:09,630
That's the problem,
you know,

2348
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:13,060
and uh,
but he apparently was like a keep saying

2349
01:43:13,061 --> 01:43:16,840
apparently apparently or adjectives or 
words.

2350
01:43:17,470 --> 01:43:22,420
He was like one of the pioneers of that 
style of comedy.

2351
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:22,910
Like,
yeah,

2352
01:43:22,940 --> 01:43:24,670
like natural talking.
Yeah.

2353
01:43:24,671 --> 01:43:26,350
Well,
not just natural talking,

2354
01:43:26,351 --> 01:43:31,140
but like knowing how to captivate a 
group and get everybody settled down and

2355
01:43:31,630 --> 01:43:33,750
put out a hat.
Like that's a.

2356
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:38,440
That's such a tough crowd that when you 
go onto a stage at a comedy club must be

2357
01:43:38,441 --> 01:43:38,960
nothing.
Yeah.

2358
01:43:38,970 --> 01:43:40,450
It's like you're running up hill all 
day.

2359
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:45,480
Whenever we saw the third street 
promenade people before we ever would 

2360
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:45,880
have thought of that to comedy here,
could I do it?

2361
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:48,490
Yeah.
It's hard though.

2362
01:43:48,491 --> 01:43:50,380
I've never seen anybody do it besides 
dave.

2363
01:43:50,381 --> 01:43:54,320
I've never seen anybody just do like 
street comedy seems weird.

2364
01:43:54,410 --> 01:43:56,200
It does.
I see that goofy.

2365
01:43:56,210 --> 01:44:01,210
Like the dancers will do comedy in 
between when they're going to make a 

2366
01:44:01,210 --> 01:44:01,210
dance.
Well,

2367
01:44:01,210 --> 01:44:02,260
I don't think dave would do it today.
I mean,

2368
01:44:02,300 --> 01:44:07,300
I know he did do some shows in seattle 
when remember when he wasn't doing 

2369
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:11,651
official shows anymore.
I did a show in seattle where it just 

2370
01:44:11,651 --> 01:44:13,160
showed up and brought like a speaker and
started doing stand up in the park.

2371
01:44:13,460 --> 01:44:15,200
Yeah.
Wow.

2372
01:44:15,580 --> 01:44:20,060
Let's put it down his.
His career has been fucking fascinating.

2373
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:22,660
It was a fascinating guy.
You ever heard?

2374
01:44:22,661 --> 01:44:24,260
I'm on the podcast.
I would definitelY,

2375
01:44:24,261 --> 01:44:26,690
but I've never run into him.
I need to run into him.

2376
01:44:26,870 --> 01:44:28,580
I haven't run into him since I've been 
doing it.

2377
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:32,210
He said I ran into him a couple times.
I got to get ahold of him.

2378
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:34,160
He would be awesome to have on.
You know.

2379
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:35,970
I bet he's a good dude,
man.

2380
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:39,650
He's a funny fucking guy too.
He's a funny guy.

2381
01:44:39,651 --> 01:44:42,570
He's been.
He's been funny for a long

2382
01:44:42,660 --> 01:44:47,660
do.
When he came back from africa and did 

2383
01:44:47,660 --> 01:44:47,660
that show in the main room?
I don't know if that was.

2384
01:44:47,660 --> 01:44:48,820
If that was after you stopped going 
there before.

2385
01:44:49,030 --> 01:44:50,740
Have that on tape too.
Really?

2386
01:44:50,770 --> 01:44:55,770
In my car.
It was so packed and everybody was 

2387
01:44:55,770 --> 01:44:55,770
there.
Fucking Bruce Willis was there.

2388
01:44:55,770 --> 01:45:00,241
Soundgarden was there.
The fire department showed up and just 

2389
01:45:00,241 --> 01:45:02,210
asked if theY could sit on the steps to 
block the pug and escape.

2390
01:45:02,450 --> 01:45:03,640
Wow.
Everybody.

2391
01:45:03,641 --> 01:45:08,641
That was the ticket.
Did you see kiss the other night was at 

2392
01:45:08,641 --> 01:45:09,800
house of blues and there was like arnold
schwarzenegger was there.

2393
01:45:10,970 --> 01:45:13,450
Stallone was their families doing the 
podcast.

2394
01:45:13,510 --> 01:45:14,820
Oh really?
Yeah,

2395
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:15,700
dog.
The bounty hunter.

2396
01:45:15,860 --> 01:45:17,090
You got eddie bravo to come into.

2397
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:17,860
Don't.
No,

2398
01:45:17,930 --> 01:45:20,270
I don't know if eddie can,
but I'm going to get an ace freely to.

2399
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:21,960
Oh wow.
Awesome.

2400
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:24,500
I met ace freely when I was like seven 
years old,

2401
01:45:24,530 --> 01:45:29,530
how my uncle was a,
he was an artist and he worked for the 

2402
01:45:29,530 --> 01:45:32,000
advertising agency that created the 
album covers and the album art.

2403
01:45:32,860 --> 01:45:34,220
I was back when they had,
you know,

2404
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:39,400
there were artwork for the album was you
would open up like especially like to 

2405
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:43,210
dislike kiss alive to have to uh,
records in it and it would open up.

2406
01:45:43,230 --> 01:45:45,200
THere's all these images and 
advertising,

2407
01:45:45,250 --> 01:45:47,450
you know,
guys would put together these albums,

2408
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:50,840
know they made the artwork.
So they hired artists,

2409
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:55,870
graphic artists to create these things.
And ace really came into the office and 

2410
01:45:55,870 --> 01:45:56,930
I was uh,
just staying.

2411
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:01,960
I went to work with my uncle,
like he took me to work with them 

2412
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:01,960
because he was an artist at the time 
too.

2413
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:05,150
I was really into art and so he wanted 
to see me to see like what his office is

2414
01:46:05,151 --> 01:46:08,750
like fucking case maybe I wanted to do 
it someday and I just so happened to be.

2415
01:46:08,770 --> 01:46:13,770
He took me in a couple of times,
but it just so happened to be there the 

2416
01:46:13,770 --> 01:46:14,020
day that ace freely arrived.
Was he wearing this makeup or no,

2417
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:17,000
no makeup.
That's why I was so crazy because at the

2418
01:46:17,001 --> 01:46:22,001
time it was.
I'm like no one knew what they looked 

2419
01:46:22,001 --> 01:46:26,201
like.
They would walk around with bandannas 

2420
01:46:26,201 --> 01:46:26,201
over their face.
It was,

2421
01:46:26,201 --> 01:46:26,201
yeah,
it was a big thing like photographers,

2422
01:46:26,201 --> 01:46:27,530
we're constantly trying to catch them.
Oh wow.

2423
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:32,560
Yeah.
They were trying to catch them out 

2424
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:32,560
because if they caught them they would 
get the first photo of them.

2425
01:46:32,690 --> 01:46:37,690
There was a few calls like this where 
you'd see you would take this much as 

2426
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:43,060
face.
You wouldn't see as total face you just 

2427
01:46:43,060 --> 01:46:43,060
a little bit.

2428
01:46:44,210 --> 01:46:45,200
So you saw him.
Yeah.

2429
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:50,500
So I saw him when I was like,
I think it was like seven or eight or 

2430
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:50,500
something like that.
It was crazy.

2431
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:50,500
I couldn't believe it.
I was like,

2432
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:52,910
starstruck.
Tell the rest of the classmates and have

2433
01:46:52,911 --> 01:46:53,620
them not believable.
Well,

2434
01:46:53,621 --> 01:46:56,190
my cousin had seen them a bunch.
My cousin,

2435
01:46:56,191 --> 01:46:57,770
I own a,
um,

2436
01:46:58,230 --> 01:47:02,160
she was uh,
like friends with them and they would go

2437
01:47:02,161 --> 01:47:04,490
play softball together and like she 
would talk about it.

2438
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:05,820
She's like,
it's the weirdest thing.

2439
01:47:05,821 --> 01:47:09,720
I played softball with gene simmons and 
like you had no makeup on.

2440
01:47:09,721 --> 01:47:14,721
We were playing softball with kiss and 
no one knows it's kits they have no 

2441
01:47:14,721 --> 01:47:15,120
makeup on and you're like,
this is the nuttiest thing ever.

2442
01:47:15,540 --> 01:47:18,300
And my uncle Was like,
he's a really cool character,

2443
01:47:18,301 --> 01:47:21,030
very artistic character.
So hIs daughter was very cool as well.

2444
01:47:21,031 --> 01:47:23,910
She was really,
she's really smart and she,

2445
01:47:24,030 --> 01:47:27,190
you know,
so like her describing it was very,

2446
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:32,240
it was like she was not,
she was totally taking into account the 

2447
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:32,820
bizarreness of it.

2448
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:38,060
She's like some standing there and I'm 
playing softball with kiss and asm got 

2449
01:47:38,060 --> 01:47:38,550
this glove on.
I'm looking around and she's like,

2450
01:47:38,551 --> 01:47:42,690
what the soft with these guys didn't 
have makeup on.

2451
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:44,670
This is,
this is the most famous.

2452
01:47:44,671 --> 01:47:47,100
but I mean she was my age.
We were both like,

2453
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:49,760
you know,
like oh,

2454
01:47:49,770 --> 01:47:50,940
they were huge.
Really?

2455
01:47:50,970 --> 01:47:52,290
Yeah.
they were gigantic.

2456
01:47:52,350 --> 01:47:57,350
I saw them in the nineties when I saw 
them in the seventies when I was a 

2457
01:47:57,350 --> 01:47:59,720
little kid.
My uncle took me to show and uh,

2458
01:47:59,740 --> 01:48:01,560
that's when he was working for the 
company back then.

2459
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,840
I was really young when they took me to 
a kiss show.

2460
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:04,920
That's weird.
I might've been,

2461
01:48:05,340 --> 01:48:07,290
I might've been like 10 or something 
like that,

2462
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:09,750
maybe 11 at the most.
I was 11,

2463
01:48:09,751 --> 01:48:14,751
but he took me to a kiss show.
Then I went to a couple and then I went 

2464
01:48:14,751 --> 01:48:16,810
to two in a row with Kevin James and 
yeah,

2465
01:48:16,870 --> 01:48:17,650
in the,
the,

2466
01:48:17,651 --> 01:48:19,110
uh,
the nineties,

2467
01:48:19,620 --> 01:48:21,240
a kiss when they made their comeback.

2468
01:48:21,270 --> 01:48:24,070
It was the nineties or the early 2000.
I think it might have been 90 days.

2469
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:25,950
I don't think I was even on fear factor 
yet.

2470
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:31,280
And kevin was out here.
Kevin had won star search and search 

2471
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:31,680
sort of push.
Man.

2472
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:34,350
Kevin is a bad motherfucker.
Norm mcdonald.

2473
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:36,630
Kevin's one of the most underrated 
standups ever.

2474
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:37,890
Really?
He went.

2475
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:39,450
He's.
Yes,

2476
01:48:39,510 --> 01:48:40,500
yes.
Listen to me.

2477
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:43,710
That dude,
he could hit moments onstage.

2478
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:46,620
He had some Bits on stage.
They were fucking murderers,

2479
01:48:46,740 --> 01:48:51,740
but he always wanted us to keep it clean
and family friendly and he wanted to 

2480
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:52,440
like,
you know,

2481
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:54,810
make it so he didn't want to piss 
anybody off.

2482
01:48:54,811 --> 01:48:57,420
He didn't want people to not be able to 
go to his shows,

2483
01:48:57,421 --> 01:48:57,780
you know,
he,

2484
01:48:57,860 --> 01:49:02,430
he kept his act real clean,
especially once he had can't queens,

2485
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:04,350
you know that he cleaned up even more.
He,

2486
01:49:04,351 --> 01:49:05,520
well he was just,
you know,

2487
01:49:05,700 --> 01:49:07,750
he would never do a bit that you would 
do or I would do.

2488
01:49:07,790 --> 01:49:09,060
Never did.
Another one is our specialty.

2489
01:49:09,070 --> 01:49:14,070
I was one of the first hour specials 
because we're just too big for a half 

2490
01:49:14,070 --> 01:49:14,070
hour and it was just like,
let me tell you something.

2491
01:49:14,070 --> 01:49:15,120
I was with that dude when he was coming 
up.

2492
01:49:15,121 --> 01:49:17,190
before you go to any of that shit,
that guy could kill me.

2493
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:20,610
He was hilarious.
He was really funny.

2494
01:49:21,210 --> 01:49:24,570
He used to do this bit about getting 
pissed because kevin is a sweet guy.

2495
01:49:24,571 --> 01:49:27,210
He's an awesome guy,
but if he gets pissed off,

2496
01:49:27,211 --> 01:49:29,070
he's got a fucking temper.
He doesn't do anythIng,

2497
01:49:29,071 --> 01:49:31,800
but he does get angry at shit.
He's not a violent guy,

2498
01:49:32,070 --> 01:49:33,930
but you could see I'm fucking crazy 
about you.

2499
01:49:34,120 --> 01:49:36,420
So yeah.
Had this bit about his girlfriend.

2500
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:41,840
He was like hitting the unlock button on
the door at the same time and she was 

2501
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:45,201
pulling the handle and they cancel each 
other out and you have this bit where 

2502
01:49:45,201 --> 01:49:47,991
they kept doing it again and do it and 
it builds up and fucking hilarious bit 

2503
01:49:47,991 --> 01:49:52,470
and he would go ape shit on stage and 
scream and I don't even think he swore 

2504
01:49:52,511 --> 01:49:57,511
back down and you might swear he like a 
little bit like shit or something like 

2505
01:49:57,511 --> 01:49:57,511
that.

2506
01:49:57,511 --> 01:49:58,670
Like every now and then.
But you know,

2507
01:49:58,690 --> 01:50:01,630
he was trying to do like a very specific
type of comedy.

2508
01:50:01,631 --> 01:50:06,631
You know,
a story about him in montreal or aspen 

2509
01:50:06,631 --> 01:50:09,090
with sussman struck a deal.
He got where you're like,

2510
01:50:09,100 --> 01:50:11,670
come talk to my guy.
Couldn't see what he can get you.

2511
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:13,570
Oh yeah,
yeah,

2512
01:50:13,571 --> 01:50:15,100
yeah.
That's an unfortunate story,

2513
01:50:15,101 --> 01:50:20,101
but I don't think we could repeat that 
because it's very bad for someone's 

2514
01:50:20,101 --> 01:50:21,300
business or whatever.
Yeah,

2515
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:23,290
we,
we can't repeat numbers either,

2516
01:50:23,291 --> 01:50:26,620
but yeah,
he got lucky and got a good manager.

2517
01:50:26,650 --> 01:50:28,490
My manager knew exactly what to do.
They were trying.

2518
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:33,540
He had other older manager that wasn't 
given them such great advice and they 

2519
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:38,001
were about to get them to make a 
terrible take this thing to a lot of 

2520
01:50:38,001 --> 01:50:38,001
shitty things to them.
One of the things that said,

2521
01:50:38,001 --> 01:50:39,700
no one would ever believe this if you 
never worked in hollywood,

2522
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:45,000
but there was a guy that was working 
with him before that actually told him 

2523
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,410
to not lose weight category.

2524
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:48,850
Yep,
he dId.

2525
01:50:48,851 --> 01:50:51,760
The actual quote was,
kevin,

2526
01:50:51,820 --> 01:50:53,710
when you lose weight,
you're losing roles.

2527
01:50:53,770 --> 01:50:55,600
Wow.
He actually said that to him.

2528
01:50:55,601 --> 01:50:57,280
When you lose weight,
when you get healthy,

2529
01:50:57,460 --> 01:50:59,980
no one's going to like you.
When you get healthy,

2530
01:51:00,330 --> 01:51:05,330
it's not a.
It's not possible for you to be this 

2531
01:51:05,330 --> 01:51:05,330
funny unless you're a fat fuck.
Okay,

2532
01:51:05,330 --> 01:51:05,920
so stay a fat fox so we can all make 
money.

2533
01:51:06,010 --> 01:51:07,930
Kevin,
when you lose weight,

2534
01:51:07,931 --> 01:51:09,280
you're losing roles.
We're losing money.

2535
01:51:09,281 --> 01:51:11,800
Kevin.
People don't want you to know early,

2536
01:51:11,950 --> 01:51:16,950
but we can use you.
It's the worst thing ever because it 

2537
01:51:16,950 --> 01:51:17,110
gave him a green light to eat.
Whatever the fuck you want.

2538
01:51:17,590 --> 01:51:22,590
Kevin,
when I first met him was like a pretty 

2539
01:51:22,590 --> 01:51:22,590
stout character,
you know,

2540
01:51:22,590 --> 01:51:26,321
and he was even thinner and more stout 
when he was in high school and he was 

2541
01:51:26,321 --> 01:51:28,330
really into karate for awhile,
did a lot of karate,

2542
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:31,120
really in good shape and when he's in 
really good shape,

2543
01:51:31,121 --> 01:51:34,330
he was 200 pounds and that man just a 
tank.

2544
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:35,770
It was all pictures of Joyce Diaz.
We were like,

2545
01:51:35,950 --> 01:51:37,120
who's that?
He's a tank.

2546
01:51:37,330 --> 01:51:38,650
Yeah.
But when it.

2547
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:41,410
When a guy tells you shit like that,
like you lose weight,

2548
01:51:41,411 --> 01:51:43,750
you're losing roles.
You're given a guy a green light to just

2549
01:51:43,751 --> 01:51:45,910
eat whatever the fuck you want,
you know,

2550
01:51:45,911 --> 01:51:47,920
that's rude.
They're just trying to make money.

2551
01:51:47,980 --> 01:51:49,510
They're just,
it just idiots.

2552
01:51:49,660 --> 01:51:52,630
People that want to tell you how you 
should be,

2553
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:54,460
you know,
you shouldn't be healthy.

2554
01:51:54,490 --> 01:51:55,120
There's kevin.

2555
01:51:57,170 --> 01:51:59,060
I don't need an iron anymore.
That's pretty cool.

2556
01:52:00,710 --> 01:52:03,770
and it's so hot down here.
I cannot take it anymore.

2557
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:05,090
Although my role,
I have air conditioning,

2558
01:52:05,091 --> 01:52:06,980
which I love.
It's great because I grew up without air

2559
01:52:06,981 --> 01:52:07,910
conditioning.
It was the worst.

2560
01:52:08,150 --> 01:52:09,850
My dad was too cheap.
It was like we'll

2561
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:14,880
do is bits because he probably wouldn't 
like that because it starts two minute 

2562
01:52:15,871 --> 01:52:16,930
comedy.
Yeah.

2563
01:52:17,010 --> 01:52:17,940
SO weird.
Yeah.

2564
01:52:17,941 --> 01:52:18,810
You probably would go,
god,

2565
01:52:18,811 --> 01:52:22,280
you fucking do my bed.
You know,

2566
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:27,560
comedians are like,
take a chunk of their material and put 

2567
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:27,560
it on.
Like,

2568
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:27,560
oh,
I hate that shit.

2569
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:30,570
Don't fucking do that.
But he would kill me.

2570
01:52:30,571 --> 01:52:31,650
Man.
He was really funny.

2571
01:52:31,710 --> 01:52:32,380
He just,
you know,

2572
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:34,920
decided to.
He got really into making the tv show.

2573
01:52:34,980 --> 01:52:38,730
I really enjoy the process of really 
making a sitcom now.

2574
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:40,620
He's good.
He's good at that shit.

2575
01:52:40,621 --> 01:52:42,030
He's good at comedic acting,
you know?

2576
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:45,500
I just really wish you would really 
chased comedy more.

2577
01:52:45,630 --> 01:52:47,630
Stand up guy was so funny,
man.

2578
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:52,840
He used to kill me when we were kids 
where like in our early twenties 

2579
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:53,660
together and we would do gigs together.
We did a lot of gigs together.

2580
01:52:53,870 --> 01:52:55,130
He was hilarious man.

2581
01:52:55,460 --> 01:53:00,460
He was hilarious dude.
And he was like real honest about his 

2582
01:53:00,460 --> 01:53:03,371
insecurities and show people.
Some of them we started with are 

2583
01:53:03,371 --> 01:53:03,371
actually still around.
Yeah.

2584
01:53:03,371 --> 01:53:05,240
A lot of them are still around eight it.
Yeah.

2585
01:53:05,241 --> 01:53:07,910
A lot of them have made it real in this.
Yeah,

2586
01:53:07,911 --> 01:53:12,911
like norton norton and I had been 
friends since fuck since we were both 

2587
01:53:12,911 --> 01:53:14,130
like 21 or something like that.
You know,

2588
01:53:14,150 --> 01:53:17,120
we're both like my open mic days.
Yeah.

2589
01:53:17,210 --> 01:53:19,280
Okay.
Yeah.

2590
01:53:19,370 --> 01:53:21,470
Well greg fitzsimmons is my oldest 
friend ever.

2591
01:53:21,471 --> 01:53:25,370
greg fitzsimmons and I literally went on
stage like within a week of each other.

2592
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:28,970
Wow.
We were friends in the dark,

2593
01:53:28,971 --> 01:53:33,971
dark days of open mic nights.
We were buddies back when we were 

2594
01:53:33,971 --> 01:53:36,100
complete amateurs.
Neither one of them.

2595
01:53:36,110 --> 01:53:38,990
We were terrible.
We have nothing.

2596
01:53:39,140 --> 01:53:44,140
So to like be friends with your friends 
now see him like I downloaded the past 

2597
01:53:44,871 --> 01:53:46,160
six months where we're small.

2598
01:53:46,490 --> 01:53:48,000
Not so good for sure.
But I,

2599
01:53:48,001 --> 01:53:53,001
I downloaded his new comedy special.
He just has a comedy special is that's 

2600
01:53:53,001 --> 01:53:54,220
put out that the one where he talks 
about how,

2601
01:53:54,710 --> 01:53:56,450
how easy americans have it.
Yeah.

2602
01:53:56,570 --> 01:53:57,230
Yeah.
Oh,

2603
01:53:57,231 --> 01:53:58,430
it's fucking great.
Um,

2604
01:53:58,780 --> 01:54:03,780
but I listened to it on a,
on the way home from a gig and was 

2605
01:54:03,780 --> 01:54:05,930
laughing my ass off.
It was really fucking funny,

2606
01:54:06,330 --> 01:54:11,330
you know,
it was really funny and it was so cool 

2607
01:54:11,330 --> 01:54:12,350
to be able to drive home and listened 
to,

2608
01:54:12,590 --> 01:54:17,590
you know,
that I started with and he's slaying and

2609
01:54:17,691 --> 01:54:22,130
even more cool for me for greg because 
greg for a while was a.

2610
01:54:22,190 --> 01:54:25,340
Greg is a multiple time any emmy winning
writer.

2611
01:54:25,530 --> 01:54:27,050
OH yeah.
Was money writing.

2612
01:54:27,230 --> 01:54:28,000
Well,
he's like,

2613
01:54:28,030 --> 01:54:29,240
you know,
he's won emmys.

2614
01:54:29,690 --> 01:54:31,220
He's a really good writer.
You know,

2615
01:54:31,270 --> 01:54:36,270
he's got a good book as well,
but he decided to take some time off at 

2616
01:54:36,270 --> 01:54:36,270
doing standup.

2617
01:54:36,270 --> 01:54:38,260
He didn't do standup for a long time.
It really didn't.

2618
01:54:38,300 --> 01:54:43,300
I mean maybe did it occasionally,
but he really didn't dive into it like 

2619
01:54:43,300 --> 01:54:43,300
he's back doing now.
And then he,

2620
01:54:43,300 --> 01:54:44,900
after he did it,
every dove back into it,

2621
01:54:44,901 --> 01:54:47,240
then he put out this special and so it 
was,

2622
01:54:47,960 --> 01:54:52,520
it was like extra cool driving around 
listening to that special because I knew

2623
01:54:52,521 --> 01:54:54,080
what he did.
I knew how he worked.

2624
01:54:54,081 --> 01:54:59,081
I knew,
I knew that he got back into comedy and 

2625
01:54:59,081 --> 01:54:59,081
I knew that he really loved it.
Again,

2626
01:54:59,081 --> 01:55:01,760
you know,
it's like a lot of our friends,

2627
01:55:01,820 --> 01:55:06,820
we talk about that,
like calvin and I had the same 

2628
01:55:06,820 --> 01:55:07,200
conversation every week,
like he was just in some club,

2629
01:55:07,201 --> 01:55:10,910
but like he did a cap city and austin 
and we're on the phone,

2630
01:55:10,911 --> 01:55:15,911
you know,
we're just both in our cars just 

2631
01:55:15,911 --> 01:55:15,911
catching up and he goes,
he goes,

2632
01:55:15,911 --> 01:55:16,100
it's the greatest fucking job in the 
world.

2633
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:18,500
It's the greatest fucking job.
I don't want to do anything else.

2634
01:55:18,501 --> 01:55:19,370
He goes,
I do other things.

2635
01:55:19,371 --> 01:55:20,690
I don't want to do them.
He goes,

2636
01:55:20,691 --> 01:55:22,010
what I want to do is I want to do 
comedy.

2637
01:55:22,011 --> 01:55:27,011
I want to tell jokes.
It's so fun when you watch them on 

2638
01:55:27,011 --> 01:55:31,001
stage.
I've had a chance to do some shows with 

2639
01:55:31,001 --> 01:55:33,191
him lately too,
and you could see him just really 

2640
01:55:33,191 --> 01:55:36,341
enjoying this,
having done all these movies and all 

2641
01:55:36,341 --> 01:55:39,341
these tv shows that he didn't really 
necessarily enjoy because he thought he 

2642
01:55:39,341 --> 01:55:42,611
was supposed to be an actor and then 
seeing him just murdering with his own 

2643
01:55:42,611 --> 01:55:45,120
silly goose style of comedy.
Because he's so silly,

2644
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:48,570
you know,
really fucking great to see man.

2645
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:51,270
Really great to see.
Really funny,

2646
01:55:51,271 --> 01:55:54,070
funny shit too man.
Like having,

2647
01:55:54,090 --> 01:55:59,090
knowing guys.
I've known calvin since [inaudible] 94 

2648
01:55:59,090 --> 01:55:59,090
early.
So I've known greg since ada.

2649
01:55:59,090 --> 01:56:00,630
Greg's the longest running friends in 
comedy,

2650
01:56:01,170 --> 01:56:04,050
but collin and I have been best friends.
It's like the moment we met,

2651
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:05,970
you know,
I mean there's like,

2652
01:56:05,971 --> 01:56:08,100
there's like a core group.
I just went to New York.

2653
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:09,330
No,
I met him out here.

2654
01:56:09,331 --> 01:56:10,890
I did.
I'm mad tv.

2655
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:16,200
Oh,
he was on mad tv and I was the host of 

2656
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:18,591
mad tv.
He was on seventh heaven for like a 

2657
01:56:18,591 --> 01:56:18,591
bunch of episodes.
Yeah,

2658
01:56:18,591 --> 01:56:21,120
he did fucking seventh.
Heaven and oz don't pull up videos of us

2659
01:56:21,121 --> 01:56:22,210
on mad tv.
I know what you're doing.

2660
01:56:22,230 --> 01:56:27,230
You were children back then,
but we became friends almost 

2661
01:56:27,230 --> 01:56:28,560
immediately,
like we said,

2662
01:56:28,570 --> 01:56:33,570
like three or four sentences together 
and we were playing and hanging out 

2663
01:56:33,570 --> 01:56:33,570
together.
Yeah.

2664
01:56:33,570 --> 01:56:33,570
It's just a fun dude,
you know?

2665
01:56:33,570 --> 01:56:36,630
I knew.
He said it's hard to make fun friends,

2666
01:56:36,780 --> 01:56:40,020
but it's cool when you run into him and 
you collect them,

2667
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:40,980
you know,
was like,

2668
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:42,050
oh,
I found a good one.

2669
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:45,390
It's good friend,
and then you see that guy prosper.

2670
01:56:45,391 --> 01:56:49,100
You see that guy growing and developing 
is like.

2671
01:56:49,170 --> 01:56:52,230
It's one of the Most depressing things 
when you see a guy who used to do good,

2672
01:56:52,231 --> 01:56:53,310
like,
I don't want to say any names,

2673
01:56:53,311 --> 01:56:58,311
but guys that we know that had potentIal
and then they fell off and then they 

2674
01:56:58,311 --> 01:56:58,680
stopped doing comedy altogether and 
you're like,

2675
01:56:58,710 --> 01:56:59,880
my god.
We came up together.

2676
01:56:59,881 --> 01:57:02,640
Like that guy was just as good as me in 
1998.

2677
01:57:02,850 --> 01:57:04,440
Like what the fuck?
Yeah,

2678
01:57:04,441 --> 01:57:06,300
they stopped,
they stopped,

2679
01:57:06,301 --> 01:57:07,950
they stopped doing comedy and they,
you know,

2680
01:57:08,010 --> 01:57:11,100
he got a job.
Like what job doing what?

2681
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:13,310
Why did he see?
Oh my god,

2682
01:57:13,710 --> 01:57:15,810
why didn't you follow up?
scares everybody else too.

2683
01:57:15,860 --> 01:57:17,130
Like I said,
a possibility.

2684
01:57:17,420 --> 01:57:22,420
Yeah.
One of the guys we know stop people 

2685
01:57:22,420 --> 01:57:25,131
don't know.
They don't understand and that's why 

2686
01:57:25,131 --> 01:57:25,131
they get angry.

2687
01:57:25,131 --> 01:57:25,131
When I use the word civilian,
by the way people,

2688
01:57:25,131 --> 01:57:28,980
everyone who gets angry because I use 
the word civilian comics,

2689
01:57:29,070 --> 01:57:31,440
go fuck yourself for real,
for real.

2690
01:57:31,441 --> 01:57:35,910
Go fucking stop your whining.
Stop your demand for respect.

2691
01:57:35,911 --> 01:57:40,911
Stop all of it up.
You know what we're talking about you 

2692
01:57:40,911 --> 01:57:43,881
dummies.
We're talking aBout the dIfference 

2693
01:57:43,881 --> 01:57:43,881
between someone who understands the 
fucking hectic,

2694
01:57:43,881 --> 01:57:47,960
chaotic mental bore you go on in your 
head when you're being a standup comic.

2695
01:57:49,890 --> 01:57:54,630
We're describing the mass of of this 
life that you Will not understand if you

2696
01:57:54,631 --> 01:57:59,631
don't do it.
Just like if you're a Stock broker and 

2697
01:57:59,631 --> 01:57:59,631
I'm not,
and you call me a civilian,

2698
01:57:59,631 --> 01:58:00,570
I'm not going to get offended.
I wouldn't get offended.

2699
01:58:00,571 --> 01:58:02,550
By the way,
if I was a fucking soldier either,

2700
01:58:02,840 --> 01:58:04,500
I wouldn't get offended.
You know what people are saying?

2701
01:58:04,501 --> 01:58:06,120
It's called a Figure of speech.
Don't be a can.

2702
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:09,350
FInd some other shit to be a cut.
Don't be a can.

2703
01:58:09,510 --> 01:58:14,510
Find some other shit to be annoyed that 
there's plenty of things that are real 

2704
01:58:14,510 --> 01:58:17,541
that you can be annoyed at.
Don't be annoyed if somebody uses the 

2705
01:58:17,541 --> 01:58:17,541
term sensibility.
That's silly.

2706
01:58:17,541 --> 01:58:20,150
You see that video of that comedian and 
Tennessee that there was like a group in

2707
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:22,740
the front row that were like wrestlers 
and stuff like that.

2708
01:58:22,741 --> 01:58:26,580
Like these big guys start heckling and 
then the guy gets on stage and racks and

2709
01:58:26,581 --> 01:58:29,860
right in the balls.
Rex who comments?

2710
01:58:30,030 --> 01:58:31,140
oh no,
here's the video.

2711
01:58:31,250 --> 01:58:32,670
Oh,
I don't want to see this man.

2712
01:58:32,700 --> 01:58:36,020
The guy is huge too.
It's a little cafe.

2713
01:58:36,021 --> 01:58:37,850
I don't even know wHere that is.
He hit him in the balls.

2714
01:58:37,980 --> 01:58:40,400
He gets on stage and then racks and 
racks.

2715
01:58:40,401 --> 01:58:43,120
And why did you get the racks?
Oh,

2716
01:58:43,121 --> 01:58:46,120
he told them what it means.
Do you know the term

2717
01:58:49,710 --> 01:58:54,710
steak?
Shake my hand and be like,

2718
01:59:00,660 --> 01:59:05,660
did it?
I guess still in the room are so 

2719
01:59:06,390 --> 01:59:08,810
delightful compared to this train wreck 
over here.

2720
01:59:09,150 --> 01:59:10,650
Where did he start doing it?
Man.

2721
01:59:11,490 --> 01:59:16,490
Just wrote about the outbreak role play.
Role play gets catholic school girls.

2722
01:59:32,850 --> 01:59:33,630
Every time

2723
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:43,000
we'll find it.
Then the heckler.

2724
01:59:44,900 --> 01:59:49,030
Why was he still in the room?
These clubs like tack the comic,

2725
01:59:49,150 --> 01:59:51,860
tell them to leave,
settle his bill and leave.

2726
01:59:51,990 --> 01:59:54,130
Guy comes on stage and taps you in the 
balls.

2727
01:59:54,131 --> 01:59:59,131
It's over there,
just a little too comfortable hitting 

2728
01:59:59,231 --> 02:00:00,340
each other.
You know,

2729
02:00:00,341 --> 02:00:05,341
when you hit each other for a living,
like wrestlers slap each other in the 

2730
02:00:05,341 --> 02:00:05,890
face.
A regular person just not like that.

2731
02:00:06,810 --> 02:00:08,500
They don't want to deal with that shit 
at all.

2732
02:00:08,910 --> 02:00:12,490
Like people wHo don't respect 
professional wrestling.

2733
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:17,880
Look,
you might not enjoy it as a form of 

2734
02:00:17,880 --> 02:00:20,761
entertainment,
but you better respect like how hard it 

2735
02:00:20,761 --> 02:00:20,761
is to do hyper camera.
This store,

2736
02:00:20,761 --> 02:00:22,630
the,
the those guys fucking.

2737
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:25,720
They sacrificed every part of their bau,
weathered.

2738
02:00:25,810 --> 02:00:26,950
They're all broken up,
man.

2739
02:00:27,070 --> 02:00:30,370
That is a crazy fucking way.
or try to make a living.

2740
02:00:30,790 --> 02:00:35,790
He's throwing chairs at each other and 
shit and jumping off the top rope and 

2741
02:00:35,790 --> 02:00:36,820
fucking doing flips and landed on your 
face.

2742
02:00:36,820 --> 02:00:38,830
Yeah,
that's some crazy shit,

2743
02:00:38,831 --> 02:00:43,450
man.
That is one of the most destructive jobs

2744
02:00:43,451 --> 02:00:46,810
in show business as far as like what it 
does to your body laying on the ground.

2745
02:00:46,870 --> 02:00:49,060
OH my god.
Do you remember the brock lesnar one?

2746
02:00:49,310 --> 02:00:51,840
We did the shooting star press.
You know the.

2747
02:00:51,900 --> 02:00:53,020
He flew,
did a flip,

2748
02:00:53,021 --> 02:00:55,390
but he missed the flip and landed on his
fucking head.

2749
02:00:55,450 --> 02:00:56,560
Oh really?
Yeah.

2750
02:00:56,710 --> 02:00:59,410
He was trying to do a flip and like 
pinot guy,

2751
02:00:59,470 --> 02:01:01,960
like he was going to do top rope and do 
a flip and pinot guy,

2752
02:01:02,440 --> 02:01:03,940
but he missed.
It's just bam.

2753
02:01:04,420 --> 02:01:06,360
Right on his fucking head.
I hit slip.

2754
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:08,860
oh,
that guy just need him in the balls.

2755
02:01:17,270 --> 02:01:19,310
I know.

2756
02:01:22,860 --> 02:01:24,300
Okay.
Just I don't want to watch this man.

2757
02:01:24,330 --> 02:01:25,410
That's fucked up.
Harsh.

2758
02:01:25,450 --> 02:01:27,620
Yeah.
You shouldn't let that guy on stage.

2759
02:01:27,640 --> 02:01:32,640
He definitely should have said,
what are you gonna do like what's up 

2760
02:01:32,640 --> 02:01:33,360
with that fake bravado of having that 
guy on stage and saying,

2761
02:01:33,361 --> 02:01:38,361
what are you going to do in this fucking
giant wrestler guy standing in front of 

2762
02:01:38,361 --> 02:01:38,361
me,
but balls taunting him.

2763
02:01:38,361 --> 02:01:39,530
He shouldn't be on stage,
first of all.

2764
02:01:39,590 --> 02:01:44,590
Definitely for sure.
But you know the fucking shows 

2765
02:01:44,590 --> 02:01:44,590
basically.
It's a weird position.

2766
02:01:44,590 --> 02:01:44,590
I always like,
oh,

2767
02:01:44,590 --> 02:01:45,530
what do you want me to walk away?
Well,

2768
02:01:45,531 --> 02:01:50,531
yeah,
you getting bullied by a giant wrestler 

2769
02:01:50,531 --> 02:01:52,541
too.
I mean that guy was twice the size of 

2770
02:01:52,541 --> 02:01:52,541
that guy.
It should mean why don't you go back and

2771
02:01:52,541 --> 02:01:53,780
sit down and nobody throws them out.
It's ridiculous.

2772
02:01:53,810 --> 02:01:58,810
You can't go onstage and need somebody 
in the balls and then they don't throw 

2773
02:01:58,810 --> 02:01:58,810
you out.

2774
02:01:58,810 --> 02:01:58,810
That's bad.
Why can't you get sued for that?

2775
02:01:58,810 --> 02:02:01,130
Like even like just this random 
strangers kneed me in the balls.

2776
02:02:01,190 --> 02:02:02,780
That's not part of my job.
Yeah.

2777
02:02:02,781 --> 02:02:05,510
You should be able to sue for that.
The club for for sure.

2778
02:02:05,511 --> 02:02:07,060
You should be able to see the guy.
Yeah.

2779
02:02:07,490 --> 02:02:12,490
The guy for nina in the ball.
Well tammy Had that drink thrown on her 

2780
02:02:12,490 --> 02:02:12,490
and she tried to press charges and the 
sheriff was like,

2781
02:02:12,490 --> 02:02:13,250
nah,
it's just comedy.

2782
02:02:13,850 --> 02:02:14,480
Why?
She's like,

2783
02:02:14,481 --> 02:02:17,720
he threw a drink at my head.
He threw a glass at my head.

2784
02:02:17,930 --> 02:02:19,510
I want to press charges.
That's assault.

2785
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:21,540
They didn't bring them in.
That's,

2786
02:02:21,740 --> 02:02:26,740
that's insane.
You can't throw a glass at somebody if 

2787
02:02:26,740 --> 02:02:26,740
he hit her.
That's a fucking weapon.

2788
02:02:26,910 --> 02:02:29,360
It's just part of comedy.
It's like,

2789
02:02:29,361 --> 02:02:29,960
what?
Why?

2790
02:02:29,961 --> 02:02:34,730
Why is it part of comedy?
We don't agree to that fucking lazy cop.

2791
02:02:34,850 --> 02:02:39,850
That's what that is.
That's a guy that didn't want to fill 

2792
02:02:39,850 --> 02:02:42,041
out some paperwork.
That was with tammy because the actual 

2793
02:02:42,041 --> 02:02:45,701
assault didn't happen.
I don't know because it didn't actuallY 

2794
02:02:45,701 --> 02:02:47,710
hit her or he's a local and she's not so
like I'm not going to arrest somebody.

2795
02:02:47,720 --> 02:02:50,630
HAve some traveling in la.
It wasn't here.

2796
02:02:50,631 --> 02:02:52,040
It was on the road somewhere.
Oh,

2797
02:02:52,041 --> 02:02:53,360
well it's like,
that doesn't make any sense.

2798
02:02:53,690 --> 02:02:58,690
Like where did this take place?
It must have been some fucking 

2799
02:02:58,690 --> 02:02:58,690
hillbilly.
Yeah.

2800
02:02:58,690 --> 02:02:58,690
I don't know exactly.
Texas or somewhere.

2801
02:02:58,690 --> 02:03:00,760
A asheville making shit up.
You just making sure.

2802
02:03:00,790 --> 02:03:03,290
I don't know where it was.
Nowhere near each other.

2803
02:03:03,291 --> 02:03:05,810
Somewhere in Canada.
Something.

2804
02:03:05,860 --> 02:03:07,580
So I read back in Florida,
I don't know.

2805
02:03:07,590 --> 02:03:07,840
Something.

2806
02:03:10,740 --> 02:03:12,680
yeah man,
that's not cool.

2807
02:03:12,890 --> 02:03:15,680
But you know,
that's one of the problems with owning a

2808
02:03:15,681 --> 02:03:16,910
club.
You want a club,

2809
02:03:16,911 --> 02:03:20,150
you're serving people.
One of the most ridiculous drinks,

2810
02:03:20,870 --> 02:03:23,930
one of the most ridiculous drugs when it
comes to behavior,

2811
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,030
like managing your behavior towards 
lights.

2812
02:03:26,390 --> 02:03:31,190
You just give people like this drug that
makes them want to behave like a fucking

2813
02:03:31,191 --> 02:03:34,010
asshole,
like a good percentage of people want to

2814
02:03:34,011 --> 02:03:36,650
behave like an asshole on that,
on that drug.

2815
02:03:36,740 --> 02:03:41,740
And then you're selling that.
That's what you sell and you need them 

2816
02:03:41,740 --> 02:03:44,141
to be around.
And then you got some guy who was on 

2817
02:03:44,141 --> 02:03:46,100
stage talking mad shit about sucking 
decks and shooting common to people and 

2818
02:03:46,190 --> 02:03:48,160
people getting crazy.
Good,

2819
02:03:48,200 --> 02:03:53,200
crazy.
They're drunk and someone's talking 

2820
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:53,200
about sex and crazy.
Yeah.

2821
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:58,140
they get nutty and they,
they just can't believe what they hear 

2822
02:03:58,140 --> 02:03:58,140
and they want another drink.

2823
02:03:58,140 --> 02:03:59,210
Where's that fucking waitress?
I want to drag.

2824
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:04,280
Yeah,
they heard somebody talking loud and 

2825
02:04:04,280 --> 02:04:04,280
there's a lot of that.
We shut the fuck up.

2826
02:04:04,280 --> 02:04:07,790
LIke sometimes you hear that you guys 
need to shut the fuck up and they hear 

2827
02:04:07,790 --> 02:04:10,751
that like in the audience,
like people arguing and people or 

2828
02:04:10,751 --> 02:04:10,751
somebody else tells them to be quiet 
because they can't hear.

2829
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:15,650
Last time we were at um,
for a duncan and I were at the hollywood

2830
02:04:15,651 --> 02:04:20,651
improv in Florida.
And like some people almost duked it 

2831
02:04:20,651 --> 02:04:20,651
out.
Yeah.

2832
02:04:20,660 --> 02:04:23,540
Because one gRoup was talking,
the other group turned around.

2833
02:04:23,541 --> 02:04:25,040
They were like,
you shut the fuck up.

2834
02:04:25,220 --> 02:04:30,220
Like a guy like jumped up and he was 
pointing at these big fucking giant fat 

2835
02:04:30,220 --> 02:04:33,611
guy.
You shut the rob ford looking type 

2836
02:04:33,611 --> 02:04:33,650
character.
He was screaming at people and they were

2837
02:04:33,651 --> 02:04:35,150
screaming back at him.
And it was like,

2838
02:04:35,151 --> 02:04:36,080
wow,
in the middle,

2839
02:04:36,110 --> 02:04:38,130
in the middle of the fucking,
you guys aRe all this

2840
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:40,350
disruptive.
Please stop that.

2841
02:04:40,440 --> 02:04:45,440
Yeah.
He was getting super angry and loud 

2842
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:48,171
because the guy behind him was loud.
Like iT was more about him than it was 

2843
02:04:48,171 --> 02:04:50,460
even about.
it wasn't like he,

2844
02:04:50,700 --> 02:04:52,860
even though there was like 300 people 
there for the show.

2845
02:04:53,220 --> 02:04:56,400
Like I understand that this guy was 
being a dick,

2846
02:04:56,460 --> 02:05:01,460
but him,
his yelling made it way crazier for 

2847
02:05:01,460 --> 02:05:01,460
everybody else.
Like he wasn't concerned about that.

2848
02:05:01,460 --> 02:05:04,590
Like once the confrontation started,
it doesn't matter.

2849
02:05:04,710 --> 02:05:05,990
Sorry everybody.
But everybody.

2850
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:06,900
Yeah.
Everybody else.

2851
02:05:06,901 --> 02:05:11,901
Fuck you.
Fucking superman gun into his latest 

2852
02:05:11,901 --> 02:05:11,901
one.
Just destroying buildings.

2853
02:05:11,901 --> 02:05:12,660
Got into a fight and destroyed 
buildings.

2854
02:05:13,020 --> 02:05:14,790
That's so stupid.
Why does he fight in the desert?

2855
02:05:15,060 --> 02:05:16,410
If you're superman,
you grabbed guys.

2856
02:05:16,411 --> 02:05:17,740
You bring them out in the desert and 
kicked her out.

2857
02:05:17,741 --> 02:05:22,741
So it here.
You kick people's ass in the middle of 

2858
02:05:22,741 --> 02:05:22,741
the city.
Fucking dummy.

2859
02:05:22,741 --> 02:05:26,150
You could fly around the world in a 
second and you choose to duke it out in 

2860
02:05:26,150 --> 02:05:26,150
the city.

2861
02:05:26,150 --> 02:05:27,150
You're an asshole.
Guilty connects case.

2862
02:05:27,630 --> 02:05:32,630
Send them to the side.
Say if I was a fucking judge and 

2863
02:05:32,630 --> 02:05:33,890
superman came in and he told me smash 
these buildings apart.

2864
02:05:33,891 --> 02:05:34,560
Be like,
what?

2865
02:05:35,010 --> 02:05:37,050
Why didn't you take him to the moon?
Duke it out up there.

2866
02:05:37,051 --> 02:05:38,520
You fucking asshole.
Oh yeah,

2867
02:05:38,790 --> 02:05:41,280
that's right.
I think he wants.

2868
02:05:41,490 --> 02:05:43,590
He can do anything.
Superman can fly to space.

2869
02:05:44,010 --> 02:05:45,380
He's fucking superman.
Yeah.

2870
02:05:45,381 --> 02:05:47,580
You can't see.
He lives in a different kind of planet.

2871
02:05:47,581 --> 02:05:48,840
Man.
Never likes to americans.

2872
02:05:48,870 --> 02:05:49,560
That reason.
I'm like,

2873
02:05:49,561 --> 02:05:51,390
he seemed indestructible.
Yeah,

2874
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:54,120
totally likable.
Unless you get that kryptonite.

2875
02:05:55,140 --> 02:06:00,140
KryptOnite is right.
It's what it makes them weak.

2876
02:06:01,180 --> 02:06:04,220
It takes them out of character.
Can't make decisions for himself.

2877
02:06:04,280 --> 02:06:05,940
That is what it.
Eventually it's success.

2878
02:06:05,941 --> 02:06:10,941
Power way and he dies.
So there's times where you just know 

2879
02:06:10,941 --> 02:06:11,220
you're making the wrong decision with a 
woman or with kryptonite,

2880
02:06:11,221 --> 02:06:13,320
with a woman and you're just like,
oh,

2881
02:06:14,140 --> 02:06:15,680
why am I doing?
Even as you're doing it,

2882
02:06:15,681 --> 02:06:16,080
you're like,
why?

2883
02:06:16,081 --> 02:06:18,930
It's god because they have be up.
Well,

2884
02:06:19,110 --> 02:06:20,130
you know what it is,
man.

2885
02:06:20,131 --> 02:06:22,950
Your genes want to spread and you can't 
help it.

2886
02:06:22,951 --> 02:06:27,951
And women who have beautiful bodies,
like a woman's body is the most 

2887
02:06:27,951 --> 02:06:30,150
incredible backnet from.
And I sort of came a little bit.

2888
02:06:30,151 --> 02:06:31,500
I'll just wipe it off.
It'll be fun.

2889
02:06:34,020 --> 02:06:35,520
Let me just get my finger in there and 
cleaned it out.

2890
02:06:35,730 --> 02:06:37,350
I would not have made that decision 
yesterday.

2891
02:06:37,351 --> 02:06:39,300
Like this dinner.
What?

2892
02:06:40,140 --> 02:06:41,380
No,
I did not share.

2893
02:06:41,950 --> 02:06:43,170
I did it with a black girl.
Finally.

2894
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:44,960
Bam.
Pete.

2895
02:06:45,020 --> 02:06:47,480
And then tell me.
Hold the story.

2896
02:06:47,550 --> 02:06:51,760
Talking to them about how.
I guess so I don't know.

2897
02:06:52,610 --> 02:06:57,610
Just so you know everybody.
My next storyteller shows in los 

2898
02:06:57,610 --> 02:06:57,610
angeles,
February 27th at the improv.

2899
02:06:57,610 --> 02:06:57,610
Me,
mark,

2900
02:06:57,610 --> 02:06:58,110
marin,
ralphie may.

2901
02:06:58,170 --> 02:06:59,840
Louis cuts so far.
Wait.

2902
02:07:00,020 --> 02:07:00,930
Yeah,
$5.

2903
02:07:01,590 --> 02:07:03,240
It's nice show.
I liked that show.

2904
02:07:03,241 --> 02:07:05,400
I liked the one that you had with 
natasha.

2905
02:07:05,401 --> 02:07:09,330
Bobby lee's the going is easy.
And you were all talking about the whole

2906
02:07:09,331 --> 02:07:10,230
thing.
It was a fun one.

2907
02:07:10,340 --> 02:07:12,060
Yeah.
Do you like it?

2908
02:07:12,061 --> 02:07:12,690
Yeah,
I loved it.

2909
02:07:14,030 --> 02:07:14,620
It's so funny.
I.

2910
02:07:14,621 --> 02:07:16,270
Bobby can't not be funny.
Yeah,

2911
02:07:17,210 --> 02:07:18,720
that was a really good one.
Look at.

2912
02:07:18,730 --> 02:07:21,300
This is not happening.
Go do a youtube search for that.

2913
02:07:21,301 --> 02:07:21,960
You'll find it.
But yeah,

2914
02:07:21,961 --> 02:07:24,480
that was a good one.
The eventually just lost control.

2915
02:07:24,481 --> 02:07:25,120
If they just like,
oh,

2916
02:07:25,140 --> 02:07:25,860
whatever,
keep going.

2917
02:07:26,790 --> 02:07:29,010
I liked her bobby lives and to we both 
would you say,

2918
02:07:29,130 --> 02:07:30,090
no,
you're wrong in somebody else's.

2919
02:07:30,160 --> 02:07:31,110
You're wrong.
He'll go,

2920
02:07:31,230 --> 02:07:31,640
oh,
okay.

2921
02:07:31,670 --> 02:07:36,670
All righT.
It was really cool because I've heard 

2922
02:07:36,670 --> 02:07:36,670
that story so many times,
but never actually

2923
02:07:36,670 --> 02:07:40,750
seen like a natasha around.
All of us brought up the water thing.

2924
02:07:40,751 --> 02:07:42,160
I can tell you were like,
oh,

2925
02:07:42,161 --> 02:07:46,150
I did do that.
But you asked about who was right,

2926
02:07:46,151 --> 02:07:46,810
who was wrong.
It was like,

2927
02:07:46,870 --> 02:07:48,790
it doesn't matter.
I'm just embarrassed about my behavior.

2928
02:07:48,850 --> 02:07:51,890
I don't care who else's behavior.
Yeah.

2929
02:07:51,910 --> 02:07:56,910
Because you dumped a water glass on her 
heartbreak man.

2930
02:07:57,101 --> 02:08:02,101
It gets ya up.
San jose improv march,

2939
02:08:20,530 --> 02:08:23,500
they have like a real wood grill for 
steaks there.

2940
02:08:23,680 --> 02:08:26,230
Oh yeah.
they have like real wood coals.

2941
02:08:26,231 --> 02:08:28,060
They put lumped charcoal underneath the 
steak.

2942
02:08:28,061 --> 02:08:30,190
It's a charcoal broiler.
Really boiler.

2943
02:08:30,191 --> 02:08:31,060
Yeah.
Yeah,

2944
02:08:31,390 --> 02:08:36,390
dude,
you could watch them if you get a seat 

2945
02:08:36,390 --> 02:08:36,390
by the bar.
We went there once with two fighters.

2946
02:08:36,460 --> 02:08:39,710
We've been there a bunch of times.
John fitch and mike's wick.

2947
02:08:40,110 --> 02:08:42,970
That was a mix quick was telling us 
about how we used to work for,

2948
02:08:42,971 --> 02:08:44,620
uh,
the United States government.

2949
02:08:44,770 --> 02:08:48,010
He was working in Russia and their 
buildings were bugged.

2950
02:08:48,580 --> 02:08:53,580
The russians bugged the buildings with 
incredibly sophisticated equipment that,

2951
02:08:53,970 --> 02:08:58,970
and he was like,
they were so far ahead of what we were 

2952
02:08:58,970 --> 02:09:01,081
capable of.
He said they had bugs that were 

2953
02:09:01,081 --> 02:09:03,961
operating on the power generated by the 
movement of the building in the breeze.

2954
02:09:06,110 --> 02:09:11,110
What figured out a way to generate 
enough power to keep the microphones 

2955
02:09:11,110 --> 02:09:12,910
going and,
and transmitting,

2956
02:09:14,140 --> 02:09:18,010
transmitting like producing energy.
And they got it from the movement of the

2957
02:09:18,011 --> 02:09:19,840
fucking swaying of the building.
He was like,

2958
02:09:19,841 --> 02:09:22,480
they were so far ahead of us.
Why were they bugging his room?

2959
02:09:23,170 --> 02:09:25,710
There were bugging the whatever building
he was working at.

2960
02:09:25,730 --> 02:09:29,350
Government building he was working with.
people don't realize is that the,

2961
02:09:29,351 --> 02:09:34,080
the soviet union during the cold war,
like during the advancement of their,

2962
02:09:34,250 --> 02:09:36,460
their rocket program,
along with our rocket program,

2963
02:09:36,620 --> 02:09:39,400
they got the first fucking guy in orbit 
man over.

2964
02:09:39,401 --> 02:09:42,180
I mean they were incredibly advanced.
They things.

2965
02:09:42,280 --> 02:09:43,780
one of the reasons we've made up the 
moon landing.

2966
02:09:44,110 --> 02:09:49,110
Well,
I don't think we made up the moon 

2967
02:09:49,110 --> 02:09:49,110
landing.
I've changed my position.

2968
02:09:49,110 --> 02:09:49,110
I,
yeah.

2969
02:09:49,110 --> 02:09:50,830
This is what I think.
I think

2970
02:09:51,120 --> 02:09:56,120
give me my hours back,
five years to figure it out and

2971
02:09:58,090 --> 02:10:03,090
figure it out.
Initially if I think if you watch that 

2972
02:10:03,090 --> 02:10:03,090
fox show,
watch the fox show,

2973
02:10:03,130 --> 02:10:04,960
the moon landings,
it's very compelling.

2974
02:10:05,250 --> 02:10:10,250
It's very compelling.
It's a really interesting how it is 

2975
02:10:10,250 --> 02:10:10,250
real.
What's saying it's not real.

2976
02:10:10,250 --> 02:10:12,970
Um,
but the odds of that being true,

2977
02:10:13,390 --> 02:10:16,270
it's so small.
It's like I don't know what haPpened,

2978
02:10:16,390 --> 02:10:21,390
but if I had a guest would happen.
I would say they went to the moon and I 

2979
02:10:21,390 --> 02:10:23,260
wOuld say when you look at some of the 
photos that look like they're staged and

2980
02:10:23,261 --> 02:10:28,261
the fact that all of them were centered 
there very well could have been some 

2981
02:10:28,261 --> 02:10:29,140
counterfeit photos.
They definitely did a little bit of that

2982
02:10:29,141 --> 02:10:32,350
back then in nasa,
there was a photo from gemini,

2983
02:10:32,570 --> 02:10:37,570
I believe it was gemini 15,
it was Michael Collins and they took a 

2984
02:10:37,570 --> 02:10:41,141
photo of him and training with these 
wires and this harness on and then they 

2985
02:10:41,141 --> 02:10:45,491
blacked out all the wires and the 
background and then use the same photo 

2986
02:10:45,491 --> 02:10:46,250
and said that he was in space.

2987
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:51,400
Really it was doing a spacewalk like 
who's taking his picture that spacewalk 

2988
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:51,920
nobody.
It wasn't a real photo.

2989
02:10:51,921 --> 02:10:54,850
There was nobody out there with the 
fucking cameras with photos,

2990
02:10:54,860 --> 02:10:56,670
so we didn't know that photo.
Just.

2991
02:10:56,920 --> 02:10:59,660
They didn't think that people are gonna 
think that many steps ahead.

2992
02:10:59,661 --> 02:11:04,661
So I think there it's very possible that
they might have faked some things,

2993
02:11:06,351 --> 02:11:11,351
like some photographs might have been on
a soundstage or stuff there.

2994
02:11:11,511 --> 02:11:13,670
Yeah,
for publIcity and to make sure that they

2995
02:11:13,700 --> 02:11:18,700
got a record of john kerry show those 
pictures of Syria above dead bodies and 

2996
02:11:18,700 --> 02:11:19,710
it was from five years ago.
Dude,

2997
02:11:19,730 --> 02:11:21,890
my favorite quote,
those clinton's quote about it,

2998
02:11:21,950 --> 02:11:26,950
clinton talks about when he was a kid,
he was working for a carpenter and the 

2999
02:11:26,950 --> 02:11:31,541
guy said that he didn't believe anything
on television that those television 

3000
02:11:31,541 --> 02:11:33,560
fellers can put things on tv and make 
you think it's real.

3001
02:11:35,270 --> 02:11:37,610
And he said,
back then I thought that guy was a quack

3002
02:11:37,910 --> 02:11:42,910
but or a crank.
But during my eight years in the white 

3003
02:11:42,910 --> 02:11:45,461
house,
I saw things that made me think that 

3004
02:11:45,461 --> 02:11:45,461
maybe he was ahead of his time.
Well,

3005
02:11:46,760 --> 02:11:51,760
clinton quote on the moon landing,
do you think they tell each president 

3006
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:55,590
like,
here's the catch you up on the moon or 

3007
02:11:55,590 --> 02:11:56,870
do anything that I don't even tell them?
Why would they want to tell them?

3008
02:11:57,110 --> 02:11:58,670
Well,
if it really was fake,

3009
02:11:58,700 --> 02:12:00,470
which again,
I don't necessarily think it was.

3010
02:12:00,620 --> 02:12:05,620
I think it's more likely that there some
fuckery involved in some of the evidence

3011
02:12:06,650 --> 02:12:11,650
because you know,
they were trying to create things that 

3012
02:12:11,650 --> 02:12:11,890
were used for publicity and there's 
some,

3013
02:12:11,930 --> 02:12:14,030
some video that looks really fucking 
hokey.

3014
02:12:14,031 --> 02:12:19,031
There's like,
there's this video of them jumping 

3015
02:12:19,031 --> 02:12:20,741
around with.
they're on trampolines when they're on 

3016
02:12:20,741 --> 02:12:20,741
the moon.

3017
02:12:20,741 --> 02:12:20,741
Yeah,
it's really weird.

3018
02:12:20,741 --> 02:12:21,580
It's really weird stuff because the,
the,

3019
02:12:21,630 --> 02:12:26,630
the,
there's no consistency in the way they 

3020
02:12:26,630 --> 02:12:29,981
move.
Like if you watch the earliest video 

3021
02:12:29,981 --> 02:12:29,981
from apollo 11 when they're walking on 
the moon,

3022
02:12:29,981 --> 02:12:31,580
you can watch their movement and then 
watch the,

3023
02:12:31,600 --> 02:12:36,600
the later stuff.
It's like they move a little 

3024
02:12:36,600 --> 02:12:36,600
differently.
Like they can do weird shit.

3025
02:12:36,600 --> 02:12:37,250
Like they can jump and fly through the 
air,

3026
02:12:37,490 --> 02:12:38,870
you know,
later in the uh,

3027
02:12:39,490 --> 02:12:44,490
in the,
in the videos they got better at 

3028
02:12:44,490 --> 02:12:44,490
whatever they were doing to get better 
at walking into.

3029
02:12:44,490 --> 02:12:45,110
Well,
it's just weird.

3030
02:12:45,290 --> 02:12:50,290
So I think that it might very well be 
that some of the footage that you look 

3031
02:12:50,290 --> 02:12:51,080
at,
it's possible,

3032
02:12:51,081 --> 02:12:52,910
and I'm not suggesting that we didn't go
to the moon.

3033
02:12:53,090 --> 02:12:58,090
I know I haven't passed,
but what I'm suggesting is some of the 

3034
02:12:58,090 --> 02:13:00,941
footage might be fake.
It's possible they used to do that kind 

3035
02:13:00,941 --> 02:13:00,941
of stuff back then.

3036
02:13:00,941 --> 02:13:02,690
I know we don't like to think that,
but they did a lot of stuff,

3037
02:13:02,840 --> 02:13:06,050
but now they still do it now they still 
fake things.

3038
02:13:06,051 --> 02:13:08,900
Now it's got good boards of martin 
luther king with white women.

3039
02:13:09,880 --> 02:13:12,440
Sure.
MeanwHile,

3040
02:13:12,710 --> 02:13:14,270
martin luther king fucked a lot of white
women.

3041
02:13:14,271 --> 02:13:16,610
How about that?
How about he loved it?

3042
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:18,410
Who wouldn't your mind?
Luther king.

3043
02:13:18,620 --> 02:13:19,510
Yeah,
I bet he did.

3044
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:21,860
So he knew he was going to die.
Just a rampage.

3045
02:13:21,861 --> 02:13:24,680
Get the white posts.
What's this black girl like 5:00

3046
02:13:24,680 --> 02:13:25,760
PM or 2:30
AM.

3047
02:13:26,120 --> 02:13:27,350
What does that mean?
The color.

3048
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:29,870
Oh,
like five per.

3049
02:13:29,900 --> 02:13:30,830
This is a starter.
Black.

3050
02:13:32,490 --> 02:13:33,620
okay.
She wasn't,

3051
02:13:33,630 --> 02:13:36,440
I mean for me to go in full bore.
That's kinda crazy,

3052
02:13:36,660 --> 02:13:38,640
right?
She was not from this country.

3053
02:13:39,220 --> 02:13:40,950
She was from like uh,
the uh,

3054
02:13:41,010 --> 02:13:43,680
england or lIke the or the or the.
I'm sitting anglosaxon.

3055
02:13:43,681 --> 02:13:44,610
Jamaica.
Yeah.

3056
02:13:44,860 --> 02:13:46,300
Like raised their.
Yeah.

3057
02:13:47,220 --> 02:13:48,930
Real white.
Real.

3058
02:13:48,931 --> 02:13:50,220
Not hip.
Hoppy at all.

3059
02:13:50,550 --> 02:13:52,890
Hip hop.
It was a very starter,

3060
02:13:52,910 --> 02:13:55,290
like just get in there.
Was she half black now?

3061
02:13:55,291 --> 02:13:55,770
I mean,
you know,

3062
02:13:55,771 --> 02:14:00,510
they're all black.
Did you notice that man?

3063
02:14:00,570 --> 02:14:02,330
Did the vagina seem any different to 
you?

3064
02:14:02,470 --> 02:14:03,600
Any colors?
Any shapes?

3065
02:14:04,110 --> 02:14:07,950
Surprisingly similar to white posts.
It was pretty shocking actually.

3066
02:14:08,220 --> 02:14:11,400
How similarly shaped and feeling it was.
What's the same?

3067
02:14:11,410 --> 02:14:16,410
They're humans,
but then it got weird which she snored 

3068
02:14:16,410 --> 02:14:18,090
and it was like a manly trouble after 
that.

3069
02:14:18,150 --> 02:14:18,950
No,
no,

3070
02:14:18,951 --> 02:14:19,700
no,
no,

3071
02:14:19,710 --> 02:14:20,060
no.

3072
02:14:20,440 --> 02:14:25,440
Mainly way to sleep.
Watching your dick go into that pink 

3073
02:14:25,440 --> 02:14:27,070
holdout with the contrast with the black
is such a coolest sight though.

3074
02:14:28,210 --> 02:14:31,720
Like if you have a darker one when he.
Because they are just bright pink inside

3075
02:14:31,730 --> 02:14:34,560
like pink starburst.
You have a darker one,

3076
02:14:36,540 --> 02:14:41,540
medIum rare.
He's not the kind of things that women 

3077
02:14:41,540 --> 02:14:44,311
want to hear.
It's like a black and steak with the 

3078
02:14:44,311 --> 02:14:44,311
medium rare.
Yeah,

3079
02:14:44,311 --> 02:14:44,450
exactly.
Inside.

3080
02:14:44,960 --> 02:14:47,380
Yeah.
So good for you.

3081
02:14:47,640 --> 02:14:49,360
Thanks.
I'm adding diversity to your.

3082
02:14:49,470 --> 02:14:52,600
Exactly.
Broadening my horizons.

3083
02:14:53,110 --> 02:14:55,060
I think a lot of people would salute you
for that.

3084
02:14:55,700 --> 02:14:58,100
I'm also dating chicks a little bit too.
Yeah,

3085
02:14:58,270 --> 02:15:00,040
tHat's weird.
That weird.

3086
02:15:00,100 --> 02:15:02,380
It's hard right now to go on like full 
dates and like,

3087
02:15:02,410 --> 02:15:07,410
oh,
let's just try to explore you aS a 

3088
02:15:07,410 --> 02:15:07,410
person instead of like you get bored,
try to get laid.

3089
02:15:07,410 --> 02:15:11,820
It just seems like fuck the 
conversations you're having in my head.

3090
02:15:13,511 --> 02:15:13,960
I'm like,
come on,

3091
02:15:13,961 --> 02:15:15,830
let's just go back and fuck.
Wow.

3092
02:15:16,180 --> 02:15:18,130
I don't say that out loud.
That's what I think,

3093
02:15:18,190 --> 02:15:20,020
but that's what you think.
You don't really want to talk to them.

3094
02:15:20,021 --> 02:15:21,050
You just want to fuck them.
Yeah.

3095
02:15:21,060 --> 02:15:22,270
So I want to get to the point where I'm 
like,

3096
02:15:22,271 --> 02:15:27,271
no,
let's enjoy a new human and fucking 

3097
02:15:27,271 --> 02:15:27,271
enjoy them for a minute.
Trying to mature.

3098
02:15:27,271 --> 02:15:27,271
Right?
To,

3099
02:15:27,271 --> 02:15:27,980
uh,
to,

3100
02:15:28,040 --> 02:15:32,750
to find women that you actually like as 
people and not just as sexual partners,

3101
02:15:33,350 --> 02:15:35,510
but if you get some just purely sexual 
partners,

3102
02:15:35,511 --> 02:15:37,720
then you can do that.
Then you can afford to explore with a,

3103
02:15:37,770 --> 02:15:39,050
with a woman.
That's true.

3104
02:15:39,410 --> 02:15:43,050
Once your needs are met,
which are many biologic funding.

3105
02:15:44,620 --> 02:15:49,620
Yeah,
that's a weird thing where you supposed 

3106
02:15:49,620 --> 02:15:51,221
to not be able to say that,
but a woman is allowed to say that if a 

3107
02:15:51,221 --> 02:15:51,221
woman says that,
you know,

3108
02:15:51,221 --> 02:15:51,740
hey,
you know,

3109
02:15:51,741 --> 02:15:54,320
I take these men and I let them know,
look,

3110
02:15:54,380 --> 02:15:55,730
we're just here to.
I'm here to fuck.

3111
02:15:55,940 --> 02:15:57,020
Okay,
I'm busy.

3112
02:15:57,050 --> 02:15:59,180
I've got a career.
You can fuck me.

3113
02:15:59,181 --> 02:16:00,470
And then we'd done and you got to go 
home.

3114
02:16:00,700 --> 02:16:05,700
You know,
it's not gonna argue with the guy will 

3115
02:16:05,700 --> 02:16:05,700
be like,
okay,

3116
02:16:05,700 --> 02:16:05,700
god says,
I was like,

3117
02:16:05,700 --> 02:16:09,461
you fucking asshole.
Could you imagine if there was a hot 

3118
02:16:09,461 --> 02:16:11,540
woman who ran a business or something 
like that and whatever.

3119
02:16:11,580 --> 02:16:13,880
She makes fucking sculpture.
She say time,

3120
02:16:13,881 --> 02:16:15,500
but she needs to get laid.
So she says,

3121
02:16:15,501 --> 02:16:16,880
you listen,
here's the deal.

3122
02:16:16,910 --> 02:16:17,810
Okay,
I like you.

3123
02:16:17,811 --> 02:16:19,120
I think you're hot.
I want to fuck,

3124
02:16:19,190 --> 02:16:22,220
but I don't want you being my boyfriend.
I don't want you hanging around.

3125
02:16:22,221 --> 02:16:24,920
You can't sleep over and don't ever 
fucking tell me what to do.

3126
02:16:25,880 --> 02:16:29,030
But if you want no strings attached,
you come over and fuck me,

3127
02:16:29,140 --> 02:16:30,100
suck your deck and

3128
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:32,200
we'll have a good time.
And then when we're done you leave.

3129
02:16:32,560 --> 02:16:34,740
He'd be like,
okay,

3130
02:16:34,900 --> 02:16:37,290
I'll do that for you.
You'd be like,

3131
02:16:37,340 --> 02:16:42,340
yes,
I knew she was out there.

3132
02:16:43,560 --> 02:16:47,170
It's um,
I was having this discussion with one of

3133
02:16:47,171 --> 02:16:50,590
my wife's friends who happen to be gay 
and they were talking about,

3134
02:16:50,591 --> 02:16:53,830
um,
the difference between two gay guys like

3135
02:16:54,040 --> 02:16:59,040
hooking up gay guys,
meeting and hooking up and a guy and a 

3136
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:01,240
girl meeting and hooking up the guy.
And a girl trying to figure out how much

3137
02:17:01,250 --> 02:17:02,380
again,
are we gonna have in this.

3138
02:17:02,470 --> 02:17:05,680
How much yann for possession.
Who's gonna?

3139
02:17:05,710 --> 02:17:06,790
Who's gonna?
Be in control here.

3140
02:17:06,791 --> 02:17:07,930
Setting it up.
It's a girl.

3141
02:17:08,050 --> 02:17:10,990
Is a girl going to tell you what to do 
and answer your phone for you?

3142
02:17:11,260 --> 02:17:14,370
Or is she going to leave you alone?
Let you be you.

3143
02:17:14,371 --> 02:17:15,430
You gonna leave her alone.

3144
02:17:15,430 --> 02:17:20,430
You gotta.
Let her wear whatever she wants and not 

3145
02:17:20,430 --> 02:17:20,430
get fucking weird.
Were there.

3146
02:17:20,430 --> 02:17:21,160
You know what's going to happen here?
Are you going to say what are you really

3147
02:17:21,161 --> 02:17:23,050
going to go out with that skirt you?
Really good?

3148
02:17:23,051 --> 02:17:24,310
Well done.
Skirt for real.

3149
02:17:24,340 --> 02:17:26,920
You're setting up my knees,
not your fucking knees.

3150
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:29,470
It's not your knees,
your knees.

3151
02:17:29,471 --> 02:17:31,210
Okay,
I see your legs.

3152
02:17:31,630 --> 02:17:33,460
God.
Do we really need that much attention?

3153
02:17:33,610 --> 02:17:34,920
You know there's,
there's that,

3154
02:17:35,010 --> 02:17:37,260
there's that dude.
And then there's people that like,

3155
02:17:37,290 --> 02:17:39,310
are you a copy but you have fun.
Have a good time.

3156
02:17:39,480 --> 02:17:41,460
You know,
who are you going to be and who,

3157
02:17:41,570 --> 02:17:46,570
what?
What's she going to be happiest with 

3158
02:17:46,570 --> 02:17:49,300
that early on?
Also finding someone who's like brings 

3159
02:17:49,300 --> 02:17:53,941
out the best in you.
Like sometimes you could have 

3160
02:17:53,941 --> 02:17:53,980
relationships that bring out the worst 
in you.

3161
02:17:54,010 --> 02:17:54,610
You're like,
hey,

3162
02:17:54,730 --> 02:17:58,410
do you want to fight it initially 
forward leaning forward.

3163
02:17:59,680 --> 02:18:01,110
Oh,
it's

3164
02:18:01,140 --> 02:18:04,250
so not necessarily for any of us to do.
It's just not,

3165
02:18:04,690 --> 02:18:09,690
you know,
any of us that are involved in 

3166
02:18:09,690 --> 02:18:10,190
altercations,
like so much of it as it's both people's

3167
02:18:10,191 --> 02:18:12,170
responsibility.
You know,

3168
02:18:12,200 --> 02:18:17,200
there's a dance going on when two people
communicating with each other and a lot 

3169
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:17,200
of times we're shitty dance partner.
Yeah.

3170
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:18,470
Sometimes I feel like telling people 
that look at doesn't.

3171
02:18:18,560 --> 02:18:23,560
It's nobody's fault,
but you guys are never gonna work 

3172
02:18:23,560 --> 02:18:23,560
because you just entered into this too 
much.

3173
02:18:23,560 --> 02:18:24,770
You're just to fighting.
Some people like it,

3174
02:18:24,771 --> 02:18:25,510
man,
that's a,

3175
02:18:25,520 --> 02:18:30,520
that's a source of drawing their life.
They don't even realize that it's 

3176
02:18:30,520 --> 02:18:31,370
completely subconscious,
but they liked to duke it out.

3177
02:18:31,460 --> 02:18:34,070
They lIke it,
they liked the fucking hate it.

3178
02:18:34,310 --> 02:18:36,530
I don't like it with anybody.
I don't like it with friends.

3179
02:18:36,531 --> 02:18:40,160
I don't like it with giRlfriends.
I don't like it with anyone in business.

3180
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:42,740
I don't like with other comics.
I don't like it,

3181
02:18:42,741 --> 02:18:43,880
man.
It's nOt fun.

3182
02:18:43,881 --> 02:18:46,790
I would way rather be friendly with 
everybody.

3183
02:18:47,050 --> 02:18:48,680
Yeah,
well it's way easier that way.

3184
02:18:48,920 --> 02:18:51,470
It is way easier.
It makes everybody feel nicer,

3185
02:18:51,471 --> 02:18:54,000
but there's moments man,
but you'll run into people.

3186
02:18:54,001 --> 02:18:54,890
You're like,
god dammit.

3187
02:18:54,920 --> 02:18:57,170
I got to fucking like defend my position
here.

3188
02:18:57,171 --> 02:19:02,171
I gotta like stay afloat here.
I gotta I gotta go to shut the fuck up 

3189
02:19:02,171 --> 02:19:06,221
and leave me alone.
Like there's A moment where you have to 

3190
02:19:06,221 --> 02:19:07,490
like say something or be assertive with 
someone.

3191
02:19:07,491 --> 02:19:09,770
Just get them to fucking leave you own 
it.

3192
02:19:09,771 --> 02:19:11,570
Can just do this.
People that just don't get it.

3193
02:19:11,571 --> 02:19:13,400
They will just fuck with you until the 
end of time.

3194
02:19:13,640 --> 02:19:17,540
They're just so goofy and clunky.
They just don't get it.

3195
02:19:18,230 --> 02:19:23,230
I had an argument once at a party.
This guy was trying to tell me that the 

3196
02:19:23,230 --> 02:19:23,700
un rapes children in africa rapists.

3197
02:19:23,720 --> 02:19:24,480
Those.
Yeah.

3198
02:19:24,490 --> 02:19:26,870
As he was telling me that they were 
raped some for apples.

3199
02:19:26,930 --> 02:19:30,230
That's what he's saying,
but it was the dumbest conversation.

3200
02:19:30,260 --> 02:19:32,980
He raped him to other people.
Give them apples for like job well done.

3201
02:19:33,020 --> 02:19:38,020
Giving them apples to fuck them.
He Was saying it was like the rape them 

3202
02:19:38,020 --> 02:19:38,020
for apples.
You saying it was great.

3203
02:19:38,020 --> 02:19:41,150
The guy was just such a douche bag.
He was um,

3204
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:45,380
he was a country music guy who wound up 
getting arrested for cocaine dealing.

3205
02:19:45,710 --> 02:19:50,710
He's like a singer and it's really 
terrible country music band that my 

3206
02:19:50,710 --> 02:19:50,710
friend knew.
Yeah.

3207
02:19:50,710 --> 02:19:54,050
And he was like that low pro rah rah 
american guy,

3208
02:19:54,051 --> 02:19:58,210
but in the most idiotic way possible.
And uh,

3209
02:19:58,270 --> 02:19:59,270
you know,
he was,

3210
02:19:59,330 --> 02:20:01,760
they were talking about the United 
States,

3211
02:20:01,761 --> 02:20:04,550
what they're doing over in Afghanistan 
and this and that.

3212
02:20:04,880 --> 02:20:09,410
And He was just going on about the un 
rape and people for apples.

3213
02:20:09,410 --> 02:20:11,510
And I was like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

3214
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:12,650
Like what,
how can you,

3215
02:20:12,800 --> 02:20:14,240
first of all,
if you give someone an apple,

3216
02:20:14,241 --> 02:20:15,620
it's prostitution.
It's not rape.

3217
02:20:15,950 --> 02:20:17,000
Give them an app on your phone.
Yeah,

3218
02:20:17,001 --> 02:20:22,001
it's unfortunate,
but it's not the best prices in the 

3219
02:20:22,001 --> 02:20:22,001
world.
Rape you with an app.

3220
02:20:22,001 --> 02:20:22,460
Unless you're fucking someone with an 
apple,

3221
02:20:22,461 --> 02:20:25,460
you're not really raping them for apples
unless it's a mac book pro.

3222
02:20:25,461 --> 02:20:26,560
It's pretty good deal.
Yeah.

3223
02:20:26,840 --> 02:20:31,840
If you can get a mac book pro,
fuck you guys like really good plus one 

3224
02:20:31,840 --> 02:20:35,060
techie,
I'll give you this or whatever it was.

3225
02:20:35,061 --> 02:20:37,880
It wasn't just that.
It was just the way this guy was just so

3226
02:20:37,881 --> 02:20:40,940
aggressive with me.
It was just like such a point and he put

3227
02:20:40,941 --> 02:20:43,640
his hands on me like on my shoulder and 
said,

3228
02:20:43,670 --> 02:20:44,200
oh,
it's okay.

3229
02:20:44,210 --> 02:20:45,980
Like looking me in the eyes saying it's 
okay.

3230
02:20:46,040 --> 02:20:48,230
I understand you just hate America.
I understand you're saying,

3231
02:20:48,320 --> 02:20:51,990
oh submissive.
It's just like,

3232
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,170
dude,
get your fucking hands off me.

3233
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:56,540
Like,
and that's when it turned ugly.

3234
02:20:56,600 --> 02:20:58,370
I was like,
you gotta get your fucking hands off me.

3235
02:20:58,371 --> 02:21:01,010
Don't touch me dude.
Don't touch me and talk to America.

3236
02:21:01,610 --> 02:21:06,610
Because I questioned it.
He had escalated it to not just that I 

3237
02:21:06,610 --> 02:21:09,761
hate America,
but that he was going to like do some 

3238
02:21:09,761 --> 02:21:09,761
weird shit to me.
I'm like,

3239
02:21:09,761 --> 02:21:09,761
hold onto me.
You know?

3240
02:21:09,800 --> 02:21:14,800
It was really gross.
That does push it up a level and 

3241
02:21:14,800 --> 02:21:14,990
somebody touches you or like,
like you on the head.

3242
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,660
It was a long time ago by the way.
It was a long time ago.

3243
02:21:17,661 --> 02:21:22,661
Who knows?
If I would've ever even entered into 

3244
02:21:22,661 --> 02:21:22,661
that conversation today,
I don't think I would.

3245
02:21:22,661 --> 02:21:25,940
I think today I'm much more skillful at 
the art of evading nonsense.

3246
02:21:26,090 --> 02:21:28,430
I would have known what it was.
I was the upside.

3247
02:21:28,460 --> 02:21:29,390
None.
None.

3248
02:21:29,570 --> 02:21:31,550
I would have known,
but back then I would be like,

3249
02:21:31,551 --> 02:21:33,140
fuck,
this guy fucking touched me.

3250
02:21:33,141 --> 02:21:34,940
You know?
It was like I was ready to kill him.

3251
02:21:34,990 --> 02:21:35,720
I,
it was just,

3252
02:21:35,721 --> 02:21:39,050
it was the most ridiculous guy ever.
Like those people in your show,

3253
02:21:39,080 --> 02:21:40,650
you'll run into the man.
Oh,

3254
02:21:40,730 --> 02:21:44,900
some of the safety people yelling,
shut the fuck up.

3255
02:21:44,930 --> 02:21:45,690
It's like,
it's all unknown.

3256
02:21:45,730 --> 02:21:47,720
It's like you didn't have to say that.
Oh,

3257
02:21:47,721 --> 02:21:49,000
the people at the comedy show.
Yeah.

3258
02:21:49,410 --> 02:21:50,000
Yeah.
Well,

3259
02:21:50,001 --> 02:21:55,001
you know,
the only way to know that you shouldn't 

3260
02:21:55,001 --> 02:21:58,031
go too far is to see the results of 
going too far or other people when it 

3261
02:21:58,031 --> 02:22:02,831
gets to those artists.
Like you could've just walked away and 

3262
02:22:02,831 --> 02:22:03,200
greg was right.
Everybody is ready to fistfight.

3263
02:22:03,380 --> 02:22:04,730
Well,
he's very competitive too.

3264
02:22:04,731 --> 02:22:07,130
When I did a,
doug loves movies and san diego,

3265
02:22:07,131 --> 02:22:10,480
it was me and greg fitzsimmons and,
and he took it as a game and then like,

3266
02:22:10,490 --> 02:22:15,490
could he thought I wasn't taking it 
serious and if you can tell immediately 

3267
02:22:15,490 --> 02:22:15,490
like,
no man,

3268
02:22:15,490 --> 02:22:15,490
we're in a game,
right?

3269
02:22:17,650 --> 02:22:18,900
Yeah,
he plays good pool.

3270
02:22:18,990 --> 02:22:23,990
They kicked me out of my apartment 
because let him stay at my apartment 

3271
02:22:23,990 --> 02:22:23,990
while I was in Australia.
They're like,

3272
02:22:23,990 --> 02:22:23,990
no,
no,

3273
02:22:23,990 --> 02:22:25,710
it's not so much As a friend of mine 
who's a place to stay,

3274
02:22:25,711 --> 02:22:26,040
so I'm just

3275
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:27,210
letting him stay there.
Like,

3276
02:22:27,211 --> 02:22:28,080
no,
it's not allowed.

3277
02:22:28,090 --> 02:22:33,090
I'm like,
I'm going to keep doing that because my 

3278
02:22:33,090 --> 02:22:33,090
friend like,
I can do that.

3279
02:22:33,090 --> 02:22:34,350
And she left me a note if I get out how.
That's ridiculous.

3280
02:22:34,430 --> 02:22:37,530
Yeah.
It wasn't an official eviction.

3281
02:22:37,531 --> 02:22:38,940
It was just like,
we suggest you leave.

3282
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:40,620
Why?
Because I don't know.

3283
02:22:40,621 --> 02:22:43,050
I think she had a really good hard on 
for people subletting or something.

3284
02:22:43,550 --> 02:22:48,550
I don't get it.
People are weird with their 

3285
02:22:48,550 --> 02:22:48,550
confrontations mean some of them are 
necessary,

3286
02:22:48,550 --> 02:22:50,820
but there's guys like eddie gift.
It was a perfect example.

3287
02:22:50,821 --> 02:22:52,290
That motherfucker,
every time you talk to him,

3288
02:22:52,291 --> 02:22:57,291
he's got some new,
he's got somebody else getting so we're 

3289
02:22:57,291 --> 02:22:59,870
out in the parking lot and I'm like,
fuck you and fuck you and you guys want 

3290
02:22:59,870 --> 02:23:00,570
to go.
Let's go right now.

3291
02:23:00,571 --> 02:23:01,920
and I'm like,
what are you talking about?

3292
02:23:01,921 --> 02:23:04,830
Why did it get to their fighting in a 
parking lot and the middle of the night?

3293
02:23:04,870 --> 02:23:05,700
Everyone,
everyone's drunk.

3294
02:23:05,770 --> 02:23:06,350
He hangs out with

3295
02:23:06,400 --> 02:23:07,920
people that are like that.
Also.

3296
02:23:08,350 --> 02:23:10,900
There's also this chris wild guy,
I don't know if you know him or not.

3297
02:23:10,930 --> 02:23:13,330
He's like fighting with tony hinchcliffe
right now on this show.

3298
02:23:13,331 --> 02:23:15,880
Like they're battling out of what?
What do you mean by battling?

3299
02:23:16,370 --> 02:23:20,560
Like they ads has,
has a show talking shit or whatever it's

3300
02:23:20,561 --> 02:23:25,561
called now and there's a guy that's 
always on the show called eddie if and 

3301
02:23:25,561 --> 02:23:26,520
I,
chris,

3302
02:23:26,540 --> 02:23:29,560
while tony was on the show also with 
this guy,

3303
02:23:29,561 --> 02:23:30,750
didn't know him,
you know,

3304
02:23:30,770 --> 02:23:34,400
just thought it was a friend of his.
And then guess what happened is like the

3305
02:23:34,401 --> 02:23:36,350
wild guy who was like kind of mad that 
he,

3306
02:23:36,430 --> 02:23:39,370
tony didn't know who he was or kind of 
like upset or something,

3307
02:23:39,371 --> 02:23:41,740
and then they kind of went back and 
forth on the show.

3308
02:23:41,980 --> 02:23:46,980
But now I guess he's just chris wild 
won't let it drop and has been like 

3309
02:23:46,980 --> 02:23:48,720
tweeting a things to tony and stuff and 
just,

3310
02:23:48,770 --> 02:23:49,360
I don't know if,
you know,

3311
02:23:49,361 --> 02:23:52,540
chris wilder and I used to have a tv.

3312
02:23:52,950 --> 02:23:54,750
I dunno what the fuck happened.
I can't really comment.

3313
02:23:54,760 --> 02:23:56,630
I don't know what the specifics of it 
were but.

3314
02:23:57,030 --> 02:24:01,130
But I'm on team.
Tony hinchcliffe always over there.

3315
02:24:02,130 --> 02:24:05,910
That's rosa parks on that.
So it's a parks yamaka.

3316
02:24:06,980 --> 02:24:09,210
Um,
I don't think that's a yamaka kid.

3317
02:24:09,240 --> 02:24:11,550
She's the one that lights can.
Jimi hendrix was like that.

3318
02:24:11,551 --> 02:24:12,900
As light as you're fucked,
you're fucked.

3319
02:24:12,930 --> 02:24:15,120
It's hard to tell.
In That photo I went a little darker.

3320
02:24:15,170 --> 02:24:17,720
The black and white photo.
So is the hendrix photos,

3321
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:19,950
black and white photo.
That's toronto.

3322
02:24:19,951 --> 02:24:24,720
He got busted for heroine.
Son had hail when I went to visit his,

3323
02:24:25,500 --> 02:24:28,170
his childhood home in vancouver at a 
small shrine to him.

3324
02:24:28,290 --> 02:24:29,020
Really?
Yeah.

3325
02:24:29,430 --> 02:24:31,110
Jeff ross.
A big focus on what they were near.

3326
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:34,170
That's not to data at 27,
28 years old.

3327
02:24:34,200 --> 02:24:35,920
Was he 27 and 28,
27,

3328
02:24:36,270 --> 02:24:38,010
27 years old.
He's got a shrine.

3329
02:24:38,100 --> 02:24:39,540
You.
Where's your trying bitch?

3330
02:24:39,830 --> 02:24:42,340
I don't have a shrine.
How can we get in the shrine and.

3331
02:24:42,720 --> 02:24:44,400
Good question.
That's a good question.

3332
02:24:44,460 --> 02:24:46,320
That should be a goal.
A lot of people want to engage.

3333
02:24:46,370 --> 02:24:51,180
A specialist should have a fucking 
strong and fierce shrine already.

3334
02:24:51,181 --> 02:24:56,181
The great was born here or the already 
the great is born from the mediocrity of

3335
02:24:58,141 --> 02:25:02,270
his mother's pussy right here.
Just make my own stride.

3336
02:25:03,500 --> 02:25:04,640
the hospital,
whatever.

3337
02:25:04,650 --> 02:25:09,650
Right.
It like if you ever read someone's bio 

3338
02:25:09,650 --> 02:25:09,650
on their website,
you know,

3339
02:25:09,650 --> 02:25:12,440
they wrote it themselves and makes you a
fucking up their lives in a part of like

3340
02:25:12,480 --> 02:25:17,480
near Washington dc where people have 
historic houses things and he just made 

3341
02:25:17,480 --> 02:25:18,090
one up.
I made up of historic house.

3342
02:25:18,150 --> 02:25:21,420
It was like a stop on the underground 
railroad or something like that.

3343
02:25:21,421 --> 02:25:23,110
you just made it up.
Did he apply for it?

3344
02:25:23,111 --> 02:25:24,130
Like,
it made it a real?

3345
02:25:24,130 --> 02:25:25,990
Uh,
I don't know exactly how he did it.

3346
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:27,220
If he wants the city,
I'm like,

3347
02:25:27,221 --> 02:25:32,221
this happened here.
So if we could get a plaque or if you 

3348
02:25:32,221 --> 02:25:32,221
just bought a plaque and stuck it there.
Oh,

3349
02:25:32,221 --> 02:25:32,860
okay.
Probably mostly bought a prac.

3350
02:25:32,861 --> 02:25:37,861
Right.
It would be really hard to pass that 

3351
02:25:37,861 --> 02:25:37,861
through city though.
Tell them like.

3352
02:25:37,861 --> 02:25:38,170
Yeah,
they'd be like,

3353
02:25:38,171 --> 02:25:39,880
we ain't even know unless you really 
super.

3354
02:25:39,890 --> 02:25:42,010
Yeah.
It was like some writer stayed here when

3355
02:25:42,011 --> 02:25:43,660
he was visiting.
Well,

3356
02:25:43,690 --> 02:25:46,870
there's probably a bunch of places that 
do kind of qualify for that.

3357
02:25:46,871 --> 02:25:51,130
Like for instance,
like Stephen King has a house in Maine,

3358
02:25:51,160 --> 02:25:52,180
in bangor,
Maine.

3359
02:25:52,510 --> 02:25:56,920
And like that house should be a 
historical house in my setting up there.

3360
02:25:57,070 --> 02:26:02,070
Just that,
like that was his house for so long and 

3361
02:26:02,070 --> 02:26:05,101
it's like he's got these wrought iron 
gates that have these bats on them and 

3362
02:26:05,101 --> 02:26:05,101
shit.

3363
02:26:05,101 --> 02:26:07,750
Really dope ass house and it's in the 
middle of this town of bangor,

3364
02:26:07,751 --> 02:26:12,751
Maine.
And everybody knew about it and he's 

3365
02:26:12,751 --> 02:26:13,210
such a legendary writer that that house,
to me,

3366
02:26:13,211 --> 02:26:15,130
It's like,
that's like an iconic house.

3367
02:26:15,131 --> 02:26:16,910
So you'd put like a historic.
Yeah,

3368
02:26:17,340 --> 02:26:22,340
make it,
make it a fucking museum for Stephen 

3369
02:26:22,340 --> 02:26:22,840
King fans can come in and see.
This is the desk that he actually wrote.

3370
02:26:22,990 --> 02:26:27,990
You know,
some of his novels that I love those 

3371
02:26:27,990 --> 02:26:28,660
little museums across the country.
I'll tell you man,

3372
02:26:28,661 --> 02:26:33,661
if they did that,
they would pay for that house a dozen 

3373
02:26:33,661 --> 02:26:33,661
times over.
Just let people go and see.

3374
02:26:33,661 --> 02:26:33,661
Fuck.
Yeah,

3375
02:26:33,661 --> 02:26:33,700
I would,
I would,

3376
02:26:33,730 --> 02:26:38,200
I would pay if I was in boston and I 
knew could fly up and just check out the

3377
02:26:38,201 --> 02:26:40,420
desk where Stephen King wrote the 
shining.

3378
02:26:40,900 --> 02:26:43,890
Fuck you.
I would look at that thing I want.

3379
02:26:43,900 --> 02:26:45,310
I just want to be in the room.

3380
02:26:45,460 --> 02:26:47,490
ThIs is where he wrote cujo and he 
didn't remember it.

3381
02:26:47,630 --> 02:26:48,700
Soak it a.
Yeah.

3382
02:26:48,701 --> 02:26:52,450
This is where you fit so much coke and 
drank so much booze.

3383
02:26:52,570 --> 02:26:55,690
He didn't even remember writing.
Stephen king did dinner to coke.

3384
02:26:55,930 --> 02:26:57,310
Oh my god.
Did he do coke?

3385
02:26:57,830 --> 02:27:02,830
Stephen king was a maniac.
Became wIthout cigarettes to massive 

3386
02:27:03,251 --> 02:27:06,730
amounts of coke and drink beer and he 
would drink like 16,

3387
02:27:06,731 --> 02:27:11,731
17 beers at night and just write until 
he blacked out and then fall asleep and 

3388
02:27:11,731 --> 02:27:13,200
they'd get up in the morning,
coke it up and just do it again.

3389
02:27:13,240 --> 02:27:14,650
Yeah,
he was a maniac.

3390
02:27:14,651 --> 02:27:16,960
wow.
Joe frothing at the mouth.

3391
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:19,390
He doesn't remember any of it.
It was all him.

3392
02:27:19,450 --> 02:27:21,880
He was cujo who knows.
I mean,

3393
02:27:21,881 --> 02:27:26,881
I'm sure there were some analogies in 
there somewhere between a lot of his 

3394
02:27:26,881 --> 02:27:28,690
demons and the demons he was 
experiencing by being an addict,

3395
02:27:29,440 --> 02:27:30,640
but he was getting addicted to.

3396
02:27:30,640 --> 02:27:32,680
I heard his own writing or whatever the 
book is.

3397
02:27:32,681 --> 02:27:34,550
Great.
It's great.

3398
02:27:34,590 --> 02:27:39,590
Yeah.
I've got two copies of it and realize 

3399
02:27:39,590 --> 02:27:39,590
one.
Oh wow.

3400
02:27:39,590 --> 02:27:39,590
Yeah,
it's really good.

3401
02:27:39,590 --> 02:27:39,740
It's really good.
It's,

3402
02:27:39,780 --> 02:27:40,620
it's,
he's an,

3403
02:27:40,900 --> 02:27:42,880
he's a master to me,
you know,

3404
02:27:42,881 --> 02:27:47,881
and uh,
a master a of a specific type of genre 

3405
02:27:47,881 --> 02:27:47,881
was him.
Well,

3406
02:27:47,881 --> 02:27:50,320
it's a specific type of entertainment 
that I really enjoy,

3407
02:27:50,470 --> 02:27:55,470
like complete fantasy vampires and 
demons and spaceships with aliens.

3408
02:27:55,991 --> 02:27:58,630
And I loved that shit.
I love stories.

3409
02:27:58,650 --> 02:28:00,850
Yeah.
I love all that stuff.

3410
02:28:00,851 --> 02:28:02,920
I'm a huge,
huge Stephen King fan to me.

3411
02:28:02,921 --> 02:28:05,140
He's like,
he made the World a cooler place.

3412
02:28:06,210 --> 02:28:09,280
he made the world a place with the 
movie.

3413
02:28:09,281 --> 02:28:10,450
Carrie,
you know,

3414
02:28:10,451 --> 02:28:14,140
with the book carry with christine.
That movie about the haunted car.

3415
02:28:14,350 --> 02:28:16,270
That was a fucking great movie,
man.

3416
02:28:16,570 --> 02:28:18,940
He wrote that book too,
which is even better than the movie.

3417
02:28:19,060 --> 02:28:20,320
You know,
christine was.

3418
02:28:20,321 --> 02:28:21,500
A lot of them were.
Oh,

3419
02:28:21,501 --> 02:28:23,450
he was.
The books are too long.

3420
02:28:23,451 --> 02:28:24,680
There's too much detail.
Too much.

3421
02:28:24,860 --> 02:28:26,540
You would like to have seen it all in 
the movie,

3422
02:28:26,541 --> 02:28:28,550
but it's impossible.
The movie's got to be two hours.

3423
02:28:28,650 --> 02:28:31,030
I got a lot of shitty acts.
A lot of those movies though,

3424
02:28:31,080 --> 02:28:32,440
like salem's lot.
Yeah,

3425
02:28:32,500 --> 02:28:34,300
a lot of life.
Let's just do this for 40 grand.

3426
02:28:34,390 --> 02:28:39,390
Yeah.
Well those I think was lot was for 

3427
02:28:39,390 --> 02:28:39,390
television.
I think that was made for television.

3428
02:28:39,390 --> 02:28:40,230
Was it?
That was,

3429
02:28:40,530 --> 02:28:43,120
was it sam flatmates for television?
I think it was.

3430
02:28:43,750 --> 02:28:46,690
Um,
then there was the silver bullet movie,

3431
02:28:46,691 --> 02:28:51,691
the silly werewolf corey haim member.
But then he also wrote fucking stand by 

3432
02:28:54,101 --> 02:28:54,970
me.
Yeah.

3433
02:28:55,030 --> 02:28:57,640
Which is so out of his genre.
Yeah.

3434
02:28:57,730 --> 02:28:59,380
Yeah.
Now he could write anything,

3435
02:28:59,381 --> 02:29:00,940
man,
he could write anything.

3436
02:29:01,360 --> 02:29:03,160
He's a bad motherfucker dude.
Then he followed those,

3437
02:29:03,161 --> 02:29:03,700
uh,
those,

3438
02:29:03,701 --> 02:29:05,710
uh,
a minor,

3439
02:29:05,750 --> 02:29:08,740
not minor league,
cub scout baseball players.

3440
02:29:08,741 --> 02:29:11,350
What are they called?
It's a little little leagues.

3441
02:29:11,590 --> 02:29:16,590
He followed one,
like started writing articles with them 

3442
02:29:16,590 --> 02:29:18,241
and they went all the way to the little 
league world series while he was 

3443
02:29:18,241 --> 02:29:18,241
following them,
writing about them.

3444
02:29:18,241 --> 02:29:19,300
Oh,
I didn't like the bangor Maine team.

3445
02:29:19,301 --> 02:29:20,590
Went to the nationals or something like 
that.

3446
02:29:20,620 --> 02:29:22,420
He was like writing their local paper 
about them.

3447
02:29:22,450 --> 02:29:24,010
Yeah.
Just follow them along that season.

3448
02:29:25,070 --> 02:29:25,790
Crazy.
Yeah.

3449
02:29:26,040 --> 02:29:27,670
Well it must be awesome for those guys.
Well,

3450
02:29:27,671 --> 02:29:32,671
he can do whatever he wants.
He can do whatever he wants and he 

3451
02:29:32,671 --> 02:29:32,671
didn't have to apologize to anything to 
anybody.

3452
02:29:32,671 --> 02:29:33,830
Yeah.
He's an interesting cat.

3453
02:29:33,831 --> 02:29:38,831
Stephen king for sure.
And he's really like giving in the way 

3454
02:29:38,831 --> 02:29:40,070
he communicates,
like his ideas have him on your podcast.

3455
02:29:40,071 --> 02:29:41,960
I would love to.
I would love to.

3456
02:29:42,170 --> 02:29:45,200
he's interesting in the way he 
communicates a,

3457
02:29:45,230 --> 02:29:46,700
you know how he goes through his 
process.

3458
02:29:46,701 --> 02:29:51,701
He's super honest about it and he's one 
of the rare guys that doesn't have like 

3459
02:29:51,701 --> 02:29:55,301
a setup like story in his head.
He like has these characters and he has 

3460
02:29:55,431 --> 02:29:58,070
this idea that he starts with and they 
just goes,

3461
02:29:58,550 --> 02:30:00,290
starts writing,
it just starts writing,

3462
02:30:00,291 --> 02:30:02,890
almost like goes into this crazy 
transcend and,

3463
02:30:02,990 --> 02:30:07,990
and constructs this world and then you 
get sucked into it and then you read it 

3464
02:30:07,990 --> 02:30:09,710
after he's done with and you're like,
holy shit,

3465
02:30:10,420 --> 02:30:12,770
you know,
he just brings it out of nowhere.

3466
02:30:12,771 --> 02:30:15,860
It's not like,
like we had scott sigler on the podcast.

3467
02:30:15,890 --> 02:30:19,010
It was a really cool guy and a very,
very good writer as well,

3468
02:30:19,160 --> 02:30:21,420
but he has a totally different approach.
It's got sick,

3469
02:30:21,421 --> 02:30:23,300
was approach is he knows exactly where 
he's going.

3470
02:30:23,301 --> 02:30:28,301
He knows where it's going to end,
he knows where this is going to happen 

3471
02:30:28,301 --> 02:30:30,941
and get changed up.
He knows this and has to just sort of 

3472
02:30:30,941 --> 02:30:30,941
fill it in and figure it out.
Flesh it out.

3473
02:30:30,941 --> 02:30:31,180
Yeah.
And you know,

3474
02:30:31,190 --> 02:30:33,320
make it to his liking.
but he,

3475
02:30:33,321 --> 02:30:38,321
he's very systematic about it and we 
were talking about stephen king's 

3476
02:30:38,321 --> 02:30:39,680
approach that he just lets it go and 
that guy,

3477
02:30:39,681 --> 02:30:40,820
you know,
I just don't do it that way.

3478
02:30:40,821 --> 02:30:43,070
I couldn't do it that way.
But for him obviously it worked.

3479
02:30:43,071 --> 02:30:48,071
But for cyclers,
a great writer to be in his way works 

3480
02:30:48,071 --> 02:30:49,970
too.
There's no right or wrong way to do it.

3481
02:30:50,810 --> 02:30:55,810
Do you write like that to you?
Like say I want to write a joke about 

3482
02:30:55,810 --> 02:30:55,810
driving a car?
No,

3483
02:30:55,810 --> 02:31:00,420
I'll toss things over my head.
I'll write a note in my notebook and 

3484
02:31:00,420 --> 02:31:03,391
then like when I looked to see what 
jokes I should do on stage tonight or 

3485
02:31:03,391 --> 02:31:03,391
whatever,
I'll keep passing that note.

3486
02:31:03,391 --> 02:31:05,980
I'm gonna keep thinking about it and 
then when I'm driving or when I'm on the

3487
02:31:05,981 --> 02:31:10,981
subway,
all I keep thinking it over and then 

3488
02:31:10,981 --> 02:31:12,601
I'll just like do it on stage.
So you don't actually sit in front of 

3489
02:31:12,601 --> 02:31:12,601
the computer.
How come?

3490
02:31:12,601 --> 02:31:12,760
You know,
do you try that?

3491
02:31:12,820 --> 02:31:13,630
I've never,
I've never,

3492
02:31:13,640 --> 02:31:18,640
I've tried it,
I've done it before but it's never 

3493
02:31:18,640 --> 02:31:20,551
really stuck.
I just kinda think things out in my 

3494
02:31:20,551 --> 02:31:20,551
head.
I just let my mind wander.

3495
02:31:20,551 --> 02:31:20,551
I think

3496
02:31:20,551 --> 02:31:24,980
you should write blogs.
You would have some fucking hilarious 

3497
02:31:24,980 --> 02:31:24,980
blogs,
dude,

3498
02:31:24,980 --> 02:31:28,670
and it gives you.
The thing about writing blogs is it 

3499
02:31:28,670 --> 02:31:31,851
gives you like an opportunity to spend a
lot of time thinking about a subject 

3500
02:31:31,851 --> 02:31:32,850
because in the time that it takes you to
write it and type it out,

3501
02:31:32,880 --> 02:31:37,880
you have to figure a lot more.
You're thInking a lot more and you're 

3502
02:31:37,880 --> 02:31:38,280
thinking a lot more in the containment 
of a particular subject.

3503
02:31:38,281 --> 02:31:40,680
So you actually do the thinking.
Yes.

3504
02:31:40,690 --> 02:31:41,100
Yeah,
yeah,

3505
02:31:41,101 --> 02:31:46,101
yeah.
It's forcing you to focus on one 

3506
02:31:46,101 --> 02:31:47,841
particular subject to and sometimes just
that extra focus is all you need to get 

3507
02:31:47,841 --> 02:31:49,620
that extra path.
You take off that bit.

3508
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:50,280
Like,
you know,

3509
02:31:50,281 --> 02:31:53,310
sometimes you find a bit like,
I don't know if it's this way for you,

3510
02:31:53,311 --> 02:31:56,160
but for me it is.
At least I'll have an initial direction.

3511
02:31:56,190 --> 02:31:59,760
And then along the way I realized that's
not the right direction.

3512
02:32:00,510 --> 02:32:03,420
The right direction is one of the other 
taglines and then I'll go,

3513
02:32:04,980 --> 02:32:05,700
yeah,
totally,

3514
02:32:07,440 --> 02:32:11,100
totally turns it on its head.
I find that those take place more when I

3515
02:32:11,101 --> 02:32:14,190
sit down and write things like really 
right thing.

3516
02:32:14,310 --> 02:32:15,840
Yeah.
Because I give myself more,

3517
02:32:15,900 --> 02:32:18,810
more paths,
like say if you're talking about,

3518
02:32:18,840 --> 02:32:21,150
um,
lava lamps,

3519
02:32:21,180 --> 02:32:26,180
whatever,
and you're going on a lava lamp path 

3520
02:32:26,180 --> 02:32:26,400
when while you're on that path and 
you're writing it out,

3521
02:32:26,520 --> 02:32:28,440
instead of just thinking about it in 
your head,

3522
02:32:28,590 --> 02:32:33,590
when you're forced to actually mash 
those keys and form a sentence in the 

3523
02:32:33,590 --> 02:32:38,091
correct way,
like you're going to read it to 

3524
02:32:38,091 --> 02:32:38,091
somebody,
you know.

3525
02:32:38,091 --> 02:32:38,091
Oh,
that [inaudible].

3526
02:32:38,091 --> 02:32:38,340
yeah,
that's pretty dope.

3527
02:32:38,400 --> 02:32:41,160
What's that?
It's a writing software program.

3528
02:32:41,190 --> 02:32:42,120
Has,
I can't see it.

3529
02:32:42,270 --> 02:32:45,180
Can't see it.
It's a corkboard with index cards on it,

3530
02:32:45,181 --> 02:32:50,181
but a virtual corkboard and You can put 
your notes on those virtual corkboards 

3531
02:32:51,280 --> 02:32:51,560
good.

3532
02:32:51,630 --> 02:32:53,010
Evernote sucks.
There's some.

3533
02:32:53,080 --> 02:32:53,520
Yeah,
every.

3534
02:32:53,550 --> 02:32:58,550
Well,
I like evernoTe because they don't lose 

3535
02:32:58,550 --> 02:32:58,820
stuff for me to lose stuff.
Really.

3536
02:32:58,880 --> 02:33:03,880
I've looked at.
It's been written about it loose stuff 

3537
02:33:03,880 --> 02:33:03,880
for you to really,
you know,

3538
02:33:03,880 --> 02:33:04,830
you've been.
It's been written about online,

3539
02:33:04,890 --> 02:33:05,450
you know?
Ooh,

3540
02:33:05,620 --> 02:33:06,700
that's not good.
Yeah.

3541
02:33:07,680 --> 02:33:08,630
Anyway,
yeah.

3542
02:33:09,630 --> 02:33:13,680
I think more people would benefit from 
blogs.

3543
02:33:14,250 --> 02:33:15,780
That's why I've written some of my best 
stuff.

3544
02:33:15,990 --> 02:33:16,560
So I'm,
I'm,

3545
02:33:16,610 --> 02:33:18,600
uh,
gonna start going back into blogs.

3546
02:33:18,601 --> 02:33:20,760
I'm going to commit to a one blog a 
week.

3547
02:33:20,910 --> 02:33:21,820
Really?
Yeah.

3548
02:33:22,140 --> 02:33:27,140
And then what?
You won't mind doing material out of 

3549
02:33:27,140 --> 02:33:27,140
your blogs?
Nope.

3550
02:33:27,140 --> 02:33:30,020
I don't mind doing that because it 
becomes an idea like it's an idea and 

3551
02:33:30,020 --> 02:33:30,270
the blog and then it becomes a bit full 
thing.

3552
02:33:30,390 --> 02:33:32,100
well it's either that or you don't get 
the blocks.

3553
02:33:33,360 --> 02:33:38,360
I think people like to read things and I
think that some of them are never going 

3554
02:33:38,360 --> 02:33:40,120
to go to see my standup or friends will 
get to see the germination.

3555
02:33:41,210 --> 02:33:42,300
And if You don't like it,
that's okay.

3556
02:33:42,301 --> 02:33:47,301
I get it.
I mean I've heard people complain about 

3557
02:33:47,301 --> 02:33:49,161
subjects that we talk about on the 
podcasts that eventually what's on your 

3558
02:33:49,161 --> 02:33:51,891
mind.
The problem is that's what's on your 

3559
02:33:51,891 --> 02:33:53,211
mind.
So I'm going to do with on stage what's 

3560
02:33:53,211 --> 02:33:54,581
on my mind.
It's also the problem that some people 

3561
02:33:54,581 --> 02:33:54,990
are just annoying concept,
like to complain about shit and they get

3562
02:33:54,991 --> 02:33:57,570
to talk to everybody gets to talk.
You know,

3563
02:33:57,620 --> 02:34:02,620
it's one of the beautiful things about 
the internet and one of the annoying 

3564
02:34:02,620 --> 02:34:02,620
things about the internet,
it,

3565
02:34:02,940 --> 02:34:07,350
even people that are not thoughtful,
that are all fucked up and really,

3566
02:34:07,710 --> 02:34:12,710
you know,
very hypercritical and annoying and not 

3567
02:34:12,710 --> 02:34:14,010
rational about it.
They get to talk to,

3568
02:34:14,070 --> 02:34:16,300
you know,
there's a guy who was a,

3569
02:34:16,540 --> 02:34:19,870
he was a vIdeo game guy that just quit 
social meeting,

3570
02:34:20,730 --> 02:34:22,840
quit his twitter now what's cliff epa.

3571
02:34:23,140 --> 02:34:24,070
It was another guy,
he,

3572
02:34:24,160 --> 02:34:29,160
he's like a famous for making youtube 
videos and there was this thing that 

3573
02:34:29,160 --> 02:34:32,590
they were going over his career and uh,
hIs,

3574
02:34:32,680 --> 02:34:36,460
his constant battling with people on 
these social network sites.

3575
02:34:36,670 --> 02:34:38,350
And when people would say mean things 
about him,

3576
02:34:38,351 --> 02:34:41,500
he couldn't help it.
he thought to respond or get involved in

3577
02:34:41,501 --> 02:34:46,501
these crazy fights.
And then he had started having his 

3578
02:34:46,501 --> 02:34:47,380
employees handle his treater for him and
that relieved them of as a little bit of

3579
02:34:47,381 --> 02:34:52,381
a.
So then he got to a point where it's 

3580
02:34:52,381 --> 02:34:52,381
like,
I'm,

3581
02:34:52,381 --> 02:34:52,381
I can't fucking do it anymore.
Like,

3582
02:34:52,381 --> 02:34:55,210
I'm going crazy.
I'm like real health problems and the 

3583
02:34:55,210 --> 02:34:55,210
stress of this,
you know,

3584
02:34:55,210 --> 02:34:56,980
um,
when you start looking for that shit and

3585
02:34:56,981 --> 02:34:58,690
reading that shit and getting into that 
shit,

3586
02:34:58,960 --> 02:35:01,000
it can fuck with your head man.
If you,

3587
02:35:01,001 --> 02:35:06,001
if you do something that people don't 
like and they all start attacking you 

3588
02:35:06,001 --> 02:35:08,971
for it,
attacking you as a human being and 

3589
02:35:08,971 --> 02:35:08,971
trying to like hurt your feelings.

3590
02:35:08,971 --> 02:35:11,110
It's not just one.
There's like 20 of them in a day.

3591
02:35:11,230 --> 02:35:13,570
What was that about though?
What is,

3592
02:35:13,571 --> 02:35:15,250
what about,
what did those people doing that.

3593
02:35:15,700 --> 02:35:16,940
Why did you say that?
Oh,

3594
02:35:17,290 --> 02:35:18,460
because this guy did that.
He quit.

3595
02:35:18,461 --> 02:35:21,010
He quit as a social media to get away 
from it.

3596
02:35:21,100 --> 02:35:22,270
Yeah.
I just couldn't take it anymore.

3597
02:35:22,271 --> 02:35:24,540
I mean he makes his living off his 
youtube channel.

3598
02:35:24,590 --> 02:35:29,590
He's this huge youtube channel,
like people like millions and millions 

3599
02:35:29,770 --> 02:35:32,170
of subscribers and he's got a huge,
huge twitter following.

3600
02:35:32,260 --> 02:35:34,810
Hundred thousand twitter people deleted 
it all.

3601
02:35:35,260 --> 02:35:40,260
Yeah,
because he just couldn't take it 

3602
02:35:40,260 --> 02:35:40,260
anymore.
I know it is his life,

3603
02:35:40,260 --> 02:35:41,110
but it's interesting like that,
that battle,

3604
02:35:41,320 --> 02:35:46,320
you know,
with the criticism and negative people 

3605
02:35:46,320 --> 02:35:49,771
online,
like I released that I released that I 

3606
02:35:49,771 --> 02:35:49,771
was worried,
but I released my album online with,

3607
02:35:49,771 --> 02:35:53,780
with commentary.
I put it on my podcast while we word 

3608
02:35:53,780 --> 02:35:54,560
well because I was worried that someone 
would say the only word.

3609
02:35:54,560 --> 02:35:55,900
It was like someone's going to say like,
oh,

3610
02:35:55,901 --> 02:35:59,230
this just lazy because he didn't want to
do another podcast episode this week and

3611
02:35:59,231 --> 02:36:03,790
the first comment was lazy motherfucker,
but that was the only one.

3612
02:36:03,880 --> 02:36:05,110
But It was like the first one.
I was like,

3613
02:36:05,111 --> 02:36:07,330
god damn it.
You can't listen to those people.

3614
02:36:07,331 --> 02:36:08,770
Those people are shitheads.
Yeah,

3615
02:36:08,800 --> 02:36:10,000
no,
you can't tell me that.

3616
02:36:10,660 --> 02:36:11,530
Somebody tells me like,
oh,

3617
02:36:11,531 --> 02:36:13,390
I saw this joke last time,
or whatever.

3618
02:36:13,391 --> 02:36:14,830
It's like,
it just bothers me.

3619
02:36:15,370 --> 02:36:17,290
Well,
do you need to let them know,

3620
02:36:17,291 --> 02:36:19,240
look,
I'm working on jokes and the only way to

3621
02:36:19,241 --> 02:36:21,010
work on jokes and you've got to do it 
more than once.

3622
02:36:21,480 --> 02:36:24,580
A bit is never finished unless it's done
20,

3623
02:36:24,581 --> 02:36:25,480
30,
50,

3624
02:36:25,481 --> 02:36:27,340
depending on the bed.
It's got to be done.

3625
02:36:27,341 --> 02:36:32,341
A lot of times you have to do it onstage
and perform it and tweak it and move it 

3626
02:36:32,341 --> 02:36:33,550
around and if you think that like,
you know,

3627
02:36:33,551 --> 02:36:38,551
you'd go to see me in this town,
then you go to see me in another town 

3628
02:36:38,551 --> 02:36:40,951
and it's going to be a totally different
act a month later and some possible 

3629
02:36:40,951 --> 02:36:40,951
crazy.

3630
02:36:40,951 --> 02:36:45,030
I need to work on that stuff.
Like a lot of my stuff that I've 

3631
02:36:45,030 --> 02:36:46,030
released in the past,
I wish I'd worked on it more.

3632
02:36:46,270 --> 02:36:48,310
I wish I'd spent more time going over 
it,

3633
02:36:48,820 --> 02:36:50,740
but that requires new people will come.
I go,

3634
02:36:51,250 --> 02:36:56,250
well,
it also requires you have to do it on 

3635
02:36:56,250 --> 02:36:58,560
stage.
Know I had everlast on the podcast 

3636
02:36:58,560 --> 02:37:01,561
yesterday.
We were talking about the difference 

3637
02:37:01,561 --> 02:37:01,561
between writing a song and writing a 
joke.

3638
02:37:01,561 --> 02:37:04,801
Like I've never made a joke without the 
help of other people because every joke 

3639
02:37:04,801 --> 02:37:09,481
I made,
it has to be done in front of an 

3640
02:37:09,481 --> 02:37:09,481
audience and they let me know what's 
working.

3641
02:37:09,481 --> 02:37:10,810
It's A combined effort.
It just is.

3642
02:37:10,990 --> 02:37:15,990
I can't.
I mean I'll write some good ideas that 

3643
02:37:15,990 --> 02:37:15,990
will work.
The first time I get on stage,

3644
02:37:15,990 --> 02:37:18,080
but they get better when you do them in 
front of an audience and you figure them

3645
02:37:18,081 --> 02:37:19,580
out and you gotta take chances.

3646
02:37:19,580 --> 02:37:23,540
You've got to do them this way and you 
gotta move the punchlines changing.

3647
02:37:23,580 --> 02:37:28,580
Look at order real quick.
Let me examine each of these a bunch of 

3648
02:37:28,580 --> 02:37:28,580
different ways.
You never know man.

3649
02:37:28,580 --> 02:37:31,930
Sometimes you nail one and it's just the
perfect way to say you can't believe you

3650
02:37:31,931 --> 02:37:33,990
used to say it another way before.
Pause,

3651
02:37:34,030 --> 02:37:35,420
right at some sock.
Man.

3652
02:37:35,530 --> 02:37:38,840
You know chris rock famously talks about
his,

3653
02:37:38,960 --> 02:37:43,960
one of his greatest bits of all time and
you know the bit that I love black 

3654
02:37:43,960 --> 02:37:46,190
people and I hate niggers.
Remember that bit one of the.

3655
02:37:46,220 --> 02:37:49,250
That's one of the all time.
you certainly did,

3656
02:37:49,420 --> 02:37:52,130
but it's one of the all time classic 
comedy bits.

3657
02:37:52,160 --> 02:37:54,140
It's just a brilliant bit.
Well,

3658
02:37:54,141 --> 02:37:57,080
he said that that been bombed.
Louis ck told me this.

3659
02:37:57,290 --> 02:37:59,750
He said that the bit bombed for like a 
year.

3660
02:37:59,840 --> 02:38:01,340
Really couldn't get it to work.
Right.

3661
02:38:01,670 --> 02:38:04,760
And then finally he figured out how to 
get it right.

3662
02:38:04,790 --> 02:38:06,380
If you could just figure it out how to 
do it right,

3663
02:38:06,500 --> 02:38:08,780
but he believed in it.
He believed in the premise,

3664
02:38:08,900 --> 02:38:13,900
so he chased the premise down until it 
got to a point where it was just a 

3665
02:38:13,900 --> 02:38:15,230
weapon and then when by the time it was 
on a special,

3666
02:38:15,350 --> 02:38:17,090
it's just flawless.
That bit,

3667
02:38:17,091 --> 02:38:20,400
that bit so classic.
It's a legendary but legendary,

3668
02:38:21,710 --> 02:38:24,590
but that's a perfect example of like 
legacy book can't do that.

3669
02:38:24,591 --> 02:38:26,600
if you want to hear the same jokes every
week,

3670
02:38:27,190 --> 02:38:32,190
same with rather than wondering to new 
jokes every show because you're never 

3671
02:38:32,190 --> 02:38:36,161
going to get to that level.
It was really great doing going in New 

3672
02:38:36,161 --> 02:38:36,161
York where do four,
five,

3673
02:38:36,161 --> 02:38:40,511
six spots a night and if you work on one
bit and you do want to go get that 

3674
02:38:40,511 --> 02:38:40,511
feeling of like,
oh,

3675
02:38:40,511 --> 02:38:41,480
there's a little bit in the middle.
There wasn't enough laps,

3676
02:38:41,690 --> 02:38:46,690
but then usually I wait 24 hours before 
talking about and I sort of forget this 

3677
02:38:46,690 --> 02:38:48,010
time it's 40 minutes later I'm doing it 
again.

3678
02:38:48,030 --> 02:38:48,410
I'm like,
oh,

3679
02:38:48,411 --> 02:38:50,450
it's still weak in the middle there.
So then on the subway I'm like,

3680
02:38:50,451 --> 02:38:55,451
I gotta write something and then you 
don't still weak in the middle of the 

3681
02:38:55,451 --> 02:38:55,580
next thing you do when you're like,
well that was okay,

3682
02:38:55,581 --> 02:38:57,980
maybe that'll work.
You try something else and by the end of

3683
02:38:57,980 --> 02:38:58,740
the night you'd like,
I've,

3684
02:38:58,860 --> 02:39:01,150
I've fixed this up a little bit.
[inaudible],

3685
02:39:01,160 --> 02:39:06,160
you know,
it was almost like a dilapidated house 

3686
02:39:06,160 --> 02:39:06,160
and you're like,
I've done some work on it now.

3687
02:39:06,160 --> 02:39:07,640
Sometimes when I'm in a bit that's not 
really working,

3688
02:39:07,670 --> 02:39:10,400
I try to think of myself like when I'm 
writing,

3689
02:39:10,401 --> 02:39:13,610
especially I try to think of myself as 
instead of making a bit,

3690
02:39:14,040 --> 02:39:16,940
instead of trying to turn it and figure 
out a way to make a bit,

3691
02:39:17,240 --> 02:39:22,240
just figuring out a way to just express 
what's going on and what you're talking 

3692
02:39:22,240 --> 02:39:25,991
about,
what is actually going on at a bunch of 

3693
02:39:25,991 --> 02:39:25,991
shit to it.

3694
02:39:25,991 --> 02:39:25,991
That's not necessarily the writing 
aspect of it.

3695
02:39:26,090 --> 02:39:28,970
Like write a bunch of Shit out.
Talk about the whole thing,

3696
02:39:29,200 --> 02:39:32,420
read whatever the subject of the 
building or whatever.

3697
02:39:32,830 --> 02:39:36,500
What emotions you were having.
Describe how embarrassed you fell.

3698
02:39:36,501 --> 02:39:39,050
Describe why you were embarrassed to add
a bunch of shit,

3699
02:39:39,060 --> 02:39:41,960
you know you're never going to say on 
stage a bunch of shit,

3700
02:39:41,961 --> 02:39:46,940
like go way too far and then look at it 
and go and just start cherry picking and

3701
02:39:46,941 --> 02:39:47,450
then go,
oh,

3702
02:39:47,451 --> 02:39:48,620
but this,
this makes sense.

3703
02:39:48,621 --> 02:39:53,621
If I can cut that out and go right to 
this and you'll somEtimes you just give 

3704
02:39:53,621 --> 02:39:57,341
yourself more by going too far back.
The teacher would tell us that like if 

3705
02:39:57,341 --> 02:39:57,341
people weren't going to even close to 
far enough,

3706
02:39:57,341 --> 02:39:58,850
that bloke was your cheat on me.
He was like,

3707
02:39:58,851 --> 02:40:00,530
you're not,
you're not going far enough.

3708
02:40:00,540 --> 02:40:02,240
Like I'm pretty upset.
Like it doesn't look like that.

3709
02:40:02,460 --> 02:40:05,330
And he would alwaYs go,
just do it like 10 times too much.

3710
02:40:05,510 --> 02:40:07,100
Just for argument's sake,
let me just see that.

3711
02:40:07,290 --> 02:40:08,180
And then people would do it.
He goes,

3712
02:40:08,181 --> 02:40:09,110
okay,
pull that back.

3713
02:40:09,120 --> 02:40:10,790
Like,
like three percent.

3714
02:40:10,820 --> 02:40:13,920
Like you're just barely over the line.
That's where you should be.

3715
02:40:14,480 --> 02:40:16,710
You got to take chances and people don't
want to take chances.

3716
02:40:16,711 --> 02:40:19,560
And that's one of the things that is the
hallmark of bad acting.

3717
02:40:20,060 --> 02:40:23,280
I don't really want to dive into and 
become someone else.

3718
02:40:23,310 --> 02:40:24,840
They're still clinging onto who they 
are.

3719
02:40:24,960 --> 02:40:27,210
What are you talking about?
You're not even going in there.

3720
02:40:27,600 --> 02:40:32,600
They don't even know how to be noticed.
Freddy would do that when he would 

3721
02:40:32,600 --> 02:40:35,470
really do is dad getting exasperated.
He would lift his hand all the way up 

3722
02:40:35,470 --> 02:40:38,481
over his head like at that,
and you'll see the new upper makers 

3723
02:40:38,481 --> 02:40:43,010
trying something similar.
They're hammered comments about their 

3724
02:40:43,010 --> 02:40:43,010
side.
They'd be like,

3725
02:40:43,010 --> 02:40:43,010
oh,
well,

3726
02:40:43,010 --> 02:40:46,340
you're doing that.
You just didn't have the guts to stick 

3727
02:40:46,340 --> 02:40:48,831
with it to just go for it.
This is a commitment because it's so 

3728
02:40:48,831 --> 02:40:49,170
foolish if you fail like that.
Oh yeah,

3729
02:40:49,171 --> 02:40:50,760
there was way more foolish.
Oh,

3730
02:40:50,761 --> 02:40:51,720
we've all done that.

3731
02:40:51,720 --> 02:40:56,720
We've over committed to bits and tried 
to pump them up and they're just dumb 

3732
02:40:56,720 --> 02:40:57,710
shit.
You know that feeling,

3733
02:40:57,720 --> 02:40:58,740
brian?
You know what I'm talking about.

3734
02:40:58,741 --> 02:41:03,741
When you get in the middle of a bit and 
you're really working it and you're 

3735
02:41:03,741 --> 02:41:03,741
like,
oh my god,

3736
02:41:03,741 --> 02:41:05,770
I can't even get out of this bit.
It's usually the dolphin one.

3737
02:41:05,800 --> 02:41:10,530
When people start going like women get 
disgusted about it or something.

3738
02:41:10,710 --> 02:41:12,000
Yeah.
At the dolphin.

3739
02:41:12,030 --> 02:41:12,810
I'm sorry,
the stripper one.

3740
02:41:13,080 --> 02:41:14,220
Oh,
that's even more.

3741
02:41:14,221 --> 02:41:17,220
Yeah.
Well what are they going to do every.

3742
02:41:17,290 --> 02:41:20,730
It's not for everybody.
Some people like bluegrass succeeds that

3743
02:41:20,780 --> 02:41:25,780
stories like 10 minutes long.
Like once you start to realize a whole 

3744
02:41:25,780 --> 02:41:25,920
crowd is not that intuitive,
you're like,

3745
02:41:25,980 --> 02:41:27,360
oh,
I really should've stopped.

3746
02:41:27,540 --> 02:41:29,370
Well,
I found a way out of it that lately.

3747
02:41:29,610 --> 02:41:31,260
Yeah,
that's sometimes important.

3748
02:41:31,261 --> 02:41:33,450
Part of like not doing well with a bit 
too,

3749
02:41:33,451 --> 02:41:34,290
is that it shows other.

3750
02:41:35,070 --> 02:41:37,060
Yeah.
Well also I like doing it for crowd.

3751
02:41:37,080 --> 02:41:38,490
I'd like to,
in bits for crowds,

3752
02:41:38,580 --> 02:41:43,580
I'm mixed between either putting on the 
best show or doing bits that I think 

3753
02:41:43,580 --> 02:41:44,130
this crowd won't like to see if I can 
make it work here.

3754
02:41:44,700 --> 02:41:47,040
You know what I mean?
It's a real dark joke and there's a real

3755
02:41:47,041 --> 02:41:49,260
conservative crowd.
I could do my more conservative jokes,

3756
02:41:49,261 --> 02:41:54,261
but it's sort of rather work on this in 
front of these people work in this 

3757
02:41:54,261 --> 02:41:54,330
really harsh thing in front of these 
people.

3758
02:41:54,540 --> 02:41:56,280
That's why I like going to Australia and
Switzerland,

3759
02:41:56,281 --> 02:41:59,700
amsterdam doing shows and other 
countries like I want to know what parts

3760
02:41:59,701 --> 02:42:01,470
of these really work in different 
environments.

3761
02:42:01,890 --> 02:42:02,670
Wow.
You know,

3762
02:42:02,680 --> 02:42:04,590
a comedy on state has like a thursday 
night,

3763
02:42:04,591 --> 02:42:07,350
like college night,
so it's all college students,

3764
02:42:07,920 --> 02:42:08,970
you know,
250 of them.

3765
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:09,500
So it's like.
Yeah,

3766
02:42:09,510 --> 02:42:10,920
let me see how they relate to this.

3767
02:42:11,400 --> 02:42:14,010
Right.
College kids are a different thing man,

3768
02:42:14,100 --> 02:42:19,100
because when you do like colleges,
one of the things that you realized 

3769
02:42:19,100 --> 02:42:20,490
almost immediately is how little 
experience a lot of them have in life.

3770
02:42:20,850 --> 02:42:23,400
Like a lot of them are coming from their
parents houses,

3771
02:42:23,970 --> 02:42:28,970
protected environments of their whole 
dorm to a dorm with a bunch of savage 

3772
02:42:28,970 --> 02:42:32,440
hormonally charged.
Ten is just sticking things inside their

3773
02:42:32,441 --> 02:42:37,441
parties all day,
whether it's needles or dicks or just 

3774
02:42:37,441 --> 02:42:39,240
she just fucking and doing drugs and 
getting crazy.

3775
02:42:39,690 --> 02:42:44,690
I mean people are getting crazy.
You remember how much fucking you did 

3776
02:42:44,690 --> 02:42:45,540
when you were in college?
Zero.

3777
02:42:45,730 --> 02:42:46,830
Oh no,
it barely won.

3778
02:42:47,100 --> 02:42:48,150
He didn't do any fucking.
Oh,

3779
02:42:48,151 --> 02:42:53,151
that's right.
You were a virgin religiously for 

3780
02:42:53,151 --> 02:42:53,240
religious purposes.
But then I dropped the religion is still

3781
02:42:53,250 --> 02:42:56,740
was just waiting for the right girl,
the right girl to love kate hicks.

3782
02:42:58,370 --> 02:43:00,060
I saw that you added that to your phone.

3783
02:43:00,480 --> 02:43:05,070
Your email list is that if I said I had 
to tell her revenue email address,

3784
02:43:05,080 --> 02:43:06,420
I said,
if I haven't talked to him all the time,

3785
02:43:06,421 --> 02:43:08,090
we're enemies.
Don't take this as a sign.

3786
02:43:08,091 --> 02:43:11,190
You just get in touch with me again 
unless you go.

3787
02:43:11,500 --> 02:43:13,930
Do you know where she is now?
In baltimore somewhere?

3788
02:43:13,970 --> 02:43:14,680
Yeah.
Yeah.

3789
02:43:14,910 --> 02:43:16,860
Do your friends or facebook?
No,

3790
02:43:16,900 --> 02:43:18,000
she won't be friends with me on that 
either.

3791
02:43:18,760 --> 02:43:20,720
She's doing.
She can't get the archduke anymore.

3792
02:43:22,700 --> 02:43:25,180
She's terrified.
She the one that got away crying.

3793
02:43:25,880 --> 02:43:28,040
It was like five that got away.
Thinking about the red.

3794
02:43:28,640 --> 02:43:30,620
Yeah.
Yeah,

3795
02:43:30,621 --> 02:43:33,100
there's.
I got away every time.

3796
02:43:34,340 --> 02:43:36,460
The one that always got away.
I mean,

3797
02:43:36,461 --> 02:43:38,920
I definitely got dumped.
I've definitely been dumped,

3798
02:43:38,921 --> 02:43:40,510
but when I got dumped,
I got away.

3799
02:43:40,840 --> 02:43:44,120
I realized after I go,
wow,

3800
02:43:44,140 --> 02:43:46,010
thank god,
but I was a maniac too.

3801
02:43:46,040 --> 02:43:46,810
Don't get me wrong.

3802
02:43:46,840 --> 02:43:51,840
They got away as well.
It's not like either one of us wasn't 

3803
02:43:51,840 --> 02:43:54,870
good.
I love what you can both look back and 

3804
02:43:54,870 --> 02:43:54,870
be like,
yeah,

3805
02:43:54,870 --> 02:43:55,210
what were you doing?
Wow,

3806
02:43:55,340 --> 02:43:57,070
got to be careful though,
so wrong for you.

3807
02:43:57,360 --> 02:43:59,800
Wrong for me.
You'll get into that situation where you

3808
02:43:59,801 --> 02:44:00,420
think you know,
like,

3809
02:44:00,700 --> 02:44:02,000
wow,
maybe we were meant together.

3810
02:44:02,080 --> 02:44:05,260
Now we've gone through our bullshit and 
I try to do that once.

3811
02:44:06,390 --> 02:44:07,690
Right?
because you're just comfortable.

3812
02:44:07,760 --> 02:44:12,760
Girlfriend.
When I was a teenager we met when I was 

3813
02:44:12,760 --> 02:44:14,671
25 and we went on a date in New York and
had a good time and went back and got a 

3814
02:44:14,671 --> 02:44:15,790
little of that in there and I was like,
wow,

3815
02:44:15,791 --> 02:44:17,290
maybe she's the one.
Holy shit.

3816
02:44:17,420 --> 02:44:18,930
She's the one.
Yeah.

3817
02:44:20,520 --> 02:44:22,300
So much.
Two days it was a wreck.

3818
02:44:22,360 --> 02:44:23,970
Maybe she's the one he said I think 
like,

3819
02:44:23,980 --> 02:44:28,980
well that's another thing,
one date when you're young and single 

3820
02:44:28,980 --> 02:44:32,671
and you try to like hang out for a 
weekend with someone that you barely 

3821
02:44:32,671 --> 02:44:34,420
know and like a day in where you like,
will you shut the fuck up?

3822
02:44:34,420 --> 02:44:37,300
Like what kind of craziness are you 
talking?

3823
02:44:37,480 --> 02:44:42,480
And you realize like what kind of 
nonsense people talk amongst their 

3824
02:44:42,480 --> 02:44:45,511
friends and then get stuck in the middle
of it squawking at you already.

3825
02:44:46,960 --> 02:44:49,320
Have You met anyone off of tinder yet?
What?

3826
02:44:49,330 --> 02:44:49,990
Girl?
Melbourne.

3827
02:44:50,260 --> 02:44:55,260
I hooked up with.
She's not supposed to tell that fucking 

3828
02:44:55,260 --> 02:44:58,321
kiss and tell cock sucker.
Or was melbourne going to know many 

3829
02:44:58,321 --> 02:44:58,750
people they know fucked are in 
melbourne.

3830
02:44:59,730 --> 02:45:01,140
I'm tired.
No,

3831
02:45:01,200 --> 02:45:03,130
I like to know more than anything more 
than.

3832
02:45:03,170 --> 02:45:08,170
Because I went on one date in New York 
and we were like made out and that was 

3833
02:45:08,170 --> 02:45:10,951
it.
And then another date we didn't do 

3834
02:45:10,951 --> 02:45:12,241
anything but like it's nice to be able 
to reject girls are kind of out of your 

3835
02:45:12,241 --> 02:45:13,360
league just to be like,
nah,

3836
02:45:14,810 --> 02:45:16,160
no thanks.
Yeah.

3837
02:45:16,210 --> 02:45:18,040
Well you're just saying yes or no to all
these girls.

3838
02:45:18,041 --> 02:45:19,090
Are they putting their best pictures up?

3839
02:45:19,270 --> 02:45:22,210
You feel like your life has gone up.
Wow.

3840
02:45:22,380 --> 02:45:27,380
Because You're like,
why would I take this seven and a half 

3841
02:45:27,380 --> 02:45:27,380
when I could tell.
Just took two nights.

3842
02:45:27,380 --> 02:45:28,120
And you don't have to get the match with
any of them.

3843
02:45:28,540 --> 02:45:32,560
What are we doing to humans?
We devaluing them with no numbers on a,

3844
02:45:32,570 --> 02:45:36,370
on an iphone app.
I don't know if it's setting us free.

3845
02:45:37,330 --> 02:45:42,330
Well,
I think it's definitely a vital norms 

3846
02:45:42,330 --> 02:45:43,981
that aren't really us.
DEfinitely setting a lot of people free 

3847
02:45:43,981 --> 02:45:43,981
from the,
uh,

3848
02:45:43,981 --> 02:45:45,100
the difficulty in getting laid.
I saw two hippos.

3849
02:45:45,101 --> 02:45:50,101
Fucking the zoo being simone and pizza.
Tinder did not meet on tinder.

3850
02:45:50,950 --> 02:45:55,950
It was the base level of it.
It's like that old joke you add with 

3851
02:45:55,950 --> 02:45:55,950
the,
uh,

3852
02:45:55,950 --> 02:45:55,950
with the lions tigers though.
Like,

3853
02:45:55,950 --> 02:45:55,950
no.
Like,

3854
02:45:55,950 --> 02:45:57,430
oh,
I wonder if my pilot is going.

3855
02:45:57,670 --> 02:45:58,960
None of that.
Just fucking.

3856
02:45:59,330 --> 02:45:59,670
Yeah.

3857
02:45:59,770 --> 02:46:01,970
That's what tinder is like that you like
me,

3858
02:46:01,971 --> 02:46:04,180
I like you like each other looks.
Let's do this.

3859
02:46:04,240 --> 02:46:09,240
Well,
I think one of the things that's kept 

3860
02:46:09,240 --> 02:46:10,921
people from being more sexually 
liberated is that people cling when 

3861
02:46:11,091 --> 02:46:14,660
there's a shortage on when it's 
difficult to get sex.

3862
02:46:14,810 --> 02:46:18,020
People cling to each other when it's 
difficult to find partners,

3863
02:46:18,021 --> 02:46:20,810
difficult to find lovers and people that
you enjoy being with.

3864
02:46:21,020 --> 02:46:23,120
It's hard to meet people when you find 
people,

3865
02:46:23,121 --> 02:46:24,950
they get together and they get married 
real early.

3866
02:46:25,280 --> 02:46:28,250
But when people get older,
instead of playing musical chairs,

3867
02:46:28,251 --> 02:46:33,251
just grabbing onto the first chair and 
hang on and you get us something like a 

3868
02:46:33,251 --> 02:46:34,670
tinder or one of those little dating 
websites or the books.

3869
02:46:34,671 --> 02:46:39,671
Yeah,
you can just meet a bunch of new people 

3870
02:46:39,671 --> 02:46:41,501
and then find who you actually like and 
then he realized they're just meeting a 

3871
02:46:41,501 --> 02:46:42,310
bunch of people too and everybody's just
meat and it's easy to hear.

3872
02:46:42,311 --> 02:46:47,311
To me,
it's like first day at dining hall of 

3873
02:46:47,311 --> 02:46:47,311
the fucking college.
Hi,

3874
02:46:47,311 --> 02:46:47,311
how are you?
Yeah.

3875
02:46:47,311 --> 02:46:50,350
And if it becomes not hard to get a date
that that's limited limits.

3876
02:46:50,360 --> 02:46:52,730
A lot of obviously changed his life 
really.

3877
02:46:52,760 --> 02:46:57,760
He said because he was the one thing is 
worried about most of the rejection of 

3878
02:46:57,760 --> 02:46:57,830
natural fearman,
but this takes that out.

3879
02:46:57,831 --> 02:46:58,620
They've already said,
hey,

3880
02:46:58,621 --> 02:47:00,140
I'm interested.
Wow,

3881
02:47:00,141 --> 02:47:01,530
that's interesting.
That's great.

3882
02:47:01,550 --> 02:47:03,860
Great idea.
That's a great application.

3883
02:47:03,861 --> 02:47:05,030
I just met this girl

3884
02:47:05,540 --> 02:47:08,120
on on tinder and she's like,
she's like,

3885
02:47:08,130 --> 02:47:09,470
ah.
I told her my name.

3886
02:47:09,471 --> 02:47:10,480
Eventually I was like,
I might said,

3887
02:47:10,510 --> 02:47:11,840
well online,
it's brian red band.

3888
02:47:11,841 --> 02:47:12,620
And she goes,
that's weird.

3889
02:47:12,621 --> 02:47:14,600
My last name is band and I'm like,
what?

3890
02:47:14,810 --> 02:47:15,880
That's crazy.
And then,

3891
02:47:16,250 --> 02:47:18,560
and then uh,
then she,

3892
02:47:18,561 --> 02:47:23,561
uh,
she had come to the comedy store with 

3893
02:47:23,561 --> 02:47:23,750
Bobby Lee.
Bobby lee met his girl on tinder,

3894
02:47:23,930 --> 02:47:26,270
brought this girl with her and I was 
like,

3895
02:47:26,271 --> 02:47:31,271
wait,
I remember I was like staring you down 

3896
02:47:31,271 --> 02:47:33,071
the whole time.
And then I found a picture on comedy 

3897
02:47:33,071 --> 02:47:33,071
store's website of her,
of the whole patio that night,

3898
02:47:33,071 --> 02:47:33,980
like they took a picture of you.
Right?

3899
02:47:34,160 --> 02:47:36,940
And I'm staring right at her and she's 
staring right at me.

3900
02:47:37,450 --> 02:47:42,450
It's definitely working.
Her last name

3901
02:47:45,500 --> 02:47:46,120
band?
No,

3902
02:47:46,121 --> 02:47:47,650
isn't that weird?
Crazy.

3903
02:47:48,400 --> 02:47:50,140
Do it with her now.
I've even met her yet.

3904
02:47:50,270 --> 02:47:52,150
We're hurry.
Come on man.

3905
02:47:52,180 --> 02:47:54,400
How dare you?
How dare you?

3906
02:47:54,430 --> 02:47:59,430
It's hard for me to meet people often 
wonder because it's a very weird 

3907
02:47:59,430 --> 02:47:59,430
situation.
Even once you said the first move,

3908
02:47:59,430 --> 02:48:00,180
I was like,
hi,

3909
02:48:00,590 --> 02:48:04,030
I'm so we might want to.
We might want to talk to each other.

3910
02:48:05,200 --> 02:48:06,580
Yeah,
it gets tricky.

3911
02:48:06,730 --> 02:48:11,730
It gets real tricky.
You got to think about what you're 

3912
02:48:11,730 --> 02:48:11,730
doing,
getting together.

3913
02:48:11,730 --> 02:48:11,730
It gets real tricky when you show up and
you're like,

3914
02:48:11,730 --> 02:48:14,380
there were about 30 pounds at weren't 
represented in those photos.

3915
02:48:16,120 --> 02:48:21,120
What do you do that you Just enjoy the 
date and then you get at some point 

3916
02:48:21,120 --> 02:48:21,120
you're like,
you know what?

3917
02:48:21,120 --> 02:48:22,080
I don't want it to look sexy.
Whoa.

3918
02:48:22,100 --> 02:48:23,160
Ari shaffir.

3919
02:48:23,200 --> 02:48:24,730
That's why you got to do some research 
Before you go.

3920
02:48:24,731 --> 02:48:26,600
You take a screenshot of it,
cut out the picture,

3921
02:48:26,790 --> 02:48:29,050
upload it to google image search and 
I'll show you her face.

3922
02:48:29,100 --> 02:48:30,810
Ah,
god,

3923
02:48:30,820 --> 02:48:35,180
brian.
Too crafty.

3924
02:48:35,190 --> 02:48:36,030
She's like,
just

3925
02:48:36,300 --> 02:48:37,800
found out.
This girl that I met a.

3926
02:48:37,820 --> 02:48:40,940
She has a podcast on a podcast network.
I'm not.

3927
02:48:40,941 --> 02:48:45,941
I don't know if I should tell her not 
because we've been talking back and 

3928
02:48:45,941 --> 02:48:45,941
forth.
I was like,

3929
02:48:45,941 --> 02:48:45,941
it.

3930
02:48:45,941 --> 02:48:49,560
What the fuck?
This is something wrong with her having 

3931
02:48:49,560 --> 02:48:49,560
a podcast.
Yeah.

3932
02:48:49,560 --> 02:48:52,201
I just don't like the network.
So was lumber party with allie and 

3933
02:48:52,201 --> 02:48:53,170
Georgia.
Let all this shit go.

3934
02:48:53,440 --> 02:48:55,360
Don't,
don't tell people online who it is.

3935
02:48:55,361 --> 02:48:58,300
You fucking knucklehead and you want to 
ruin your life already.

3936
02:48:58,570 --> 02:49:00,670
Elliot george,
you learn how to keep secrets.

3937
02:49:00,671 --> 02:49:02,680
You fuck.
I'm not going to.

3938
02:49:02,740 --> 02:49:04,370
Probably never meet this girl.
Oh,

3939
02:49:04,510 --> 02:49:05,830
but you might,
you might,

3940
02:49:05,890 --> 02:49:08,250
it might become besties.
I've is.

3941
02:49:08,580 --> 02:49:09,000
Yeah,
man,

3942
02:49:09,001 --> 02:49:09,420
you know,
I,

3943
02:49:09,421 --> 02:49:14,421
I really resent that idea that what 
other podcasters have to,

3944
02:49:14,611 --> 02:49:15,630
uh,
be,

3945
02:49:15,631 --> 02:49:17,460
uh,
we have to be against each other.

3946
02:49:17,461 --> 02:49:22,461
We have to,
to them not even talking about your 

3947
02:49:22,461 --> 02:49:23,610
situation,
but when the stitcher awards came out,

3948
02:49:23,850 --> 02:49:26,880
we won best overall podcast.
Congratulations.

3949
02:49:29,840 --> 02:49:33,480
But what I was shocked by was like one 
of the other fucking podcast.

3950
02:49:33,481 --> 02:49:36,420
Some I've never even heard of them.
It might be the nicest guys ever,

3951
02:49:36,720 --> 02:49:37,580
but their,
uh,

3952
02:49:37,610 --> 02:49:42,610
their sound guy or something and 
instigated some fucking hate campaign 

3953
02:49:42,610 --> 02:49:42,810
against us.
Like,

3954
02:49:43,130 --> 02:49:45,420
yeah,
to tweet me and say a bunch of mean shit

3955
02:49:45,421 --> 02:49:46,830
to me.
It was like a swarm of it.

3956
02:49:47,120 --> 02:49:47,820
And I was like,
wow,

3957
02:49:47,821 --> 02:49:49,390
this is hilarious.
Like,

3958
02:49:49,560 --> 02:49:50,550
look,
guess what?

3959
02:49:50,600 --> 02:49:52,880
You know you can fucking light whatever 
podcast you want.

3960
02:49:52,950 --> 02:49:55,270
You don't have to be mean to the people 
that other people like,

3961
02:49:55,540 --> 02:49:57,840
like who gives a shit?
Like your podcast,

3962
02:49:58,080 --> 02:50:00,510
your podcast can't be that good if 
that's the way you think.

3963
02:50:00,630 --> 02:50:05,630
If you really think that way,
your podcast has got to be filled with 

3964
02:50:05,630 --> 02:50:08,541
some nonsense.
Like what David Cross hated larry the 

3965
02:50:08,541 --> 02:50:10,560
cable guy.
David cross's starting that with 

3966
02:50:10,560 --> 02:50:10,560
garbage.

3967
02:50:10,560 --> 02:50:10,560
Yeah.
That didn't work out so well.

3968
02:50:10,560 --> 02:50:12,220
That was a ridiculous thing.
Like,

3969
02:50:12,330 --> 02:50:13,230
like,
come on man.

3970
02:50:13,231 --> 02:50:18,231
You know what he's doing?
He's doing a character like the idea 

3971
02:50:18,231 --> 02:50:18,231
that this character is like locals.
What do you care?

3972
02:50:18,231 --> 02:50:20,850
It's ruining the fabric of society 
because it's already done.

3973
02:50:22,740 --> 02:50:25,830
Yeah.
That was the argument about larry.

3974
02:50:25,831 --> 02:50:27,130
The cable guy's racist.
Really?

3975
02:50:27,270 --> 02:50:28,520
Yeah.
That was a big part of it.

3976
02:50:28,530 --> 02:50:32,160
This zenith phobic fear of foreigners 
towel head talk,

3977
02:50:32,470 --> 02:50:33,390
you know,
that kind of shit.

3978
02:50:34,580 --> 02:50:35,460
I don't know,
man.

3979
02:50:35,560 --> 02:50:37,410
Just other shit to be worried about in 
this world.

3980
02:50:37,680 --> 02:50:41,730
You know that that weird thing where 
people get mad at other people for Being

3981
02:50:41,731 --> 02:50:44,850
successful or get mad at other people 
for winning an award or get mad at other

3982
02:50:44,851 --> 02:50:48,020
people for producing that you haven't 
produced to tell it.

3983
02:50:48,130 --> 02:50:53,130
You want to piss the common golf.
Oddly telling me that he's your second 

3984
02:50:53,130 --> 02:50:53,130
favorite comic book.

3985
02:50:53,130 --> 02:50:57,880
I'm still really good if all the 
convenience is better.

3986
02:50:59,170 --> 02:51:01,350
Yeah.
That's so true.

3987
02:51:01,710 --> 02:51:04,050
Well,
we're all fucked up in some way,

3988
02:51:04,110 --> 02:51:09,110
you know,
or at least we come into it fucked up 

3989
02:51:09,110 --> 02:51:10,020
and hopefully we balance out somewhere 
along the trip going to piss off a girl.

3990
02:51:10,021 --> 02:51:11,120
Here's what you do.
He'd say,

3991
02:51:11,590 --> 02:51:16,590
color.
Say close your eyes and come outside 

3992
02:51:16,590 --> 02:51:19,011
right now and then watch how 
disappointed they'll get because women 

3993
02:51:19,011 --> 02:51:22,521
think they just deserve free things.
Just assume you've got to have a 

3994
02:51:22,521 --> 02:51:25,670
president that's not nice fear.
These are terrible ideas.

3995
02:51:26,221 --> 02:51:27,810
You've got to vet these out with me.
Call me up.

3996
02:51:27,811 --> 02:51:29,310
Next time you think about doing 
something like that,

3997
02:51:30,110 --> 02:51:31,090
what are you going to do?
what?

3998
02:51:31,100 --> 02:51:32,670
What's the benefit of that?
I just got to laugh.

3999
02:51:32,720 --> 02:51:35,070
Ha ha.
You get nothing.

4000
02:51:35,370 --> 02:51:37,110
You get nothing but dick.
You want some dick?

4001
02:51:37,140 --> 02:51:39,050
You don't.
Somebody else does.

4002
02:51:39,060 --> 02:51:41,220
I get tender.
Look at my phone.

4003
02:51:41,221 --> 02:51:42,960
Fuck you.
I'm free.

4004
02:51:44,070 --> 02:51:47,250
Free dinners.
Where at every high schooler has one.

4005
02:51:47,490 --> 02:51:50,750
So what's that?
Every high school and I was one a 10,

4006
02:51:50,751 --> 02:51:52,050
but tinder,
I'm sure they do.

4007
02:51:52,240 --> 02:51:53,380
They're going on.
They're on.

4008
02:51:53,610 --> 02:51:58,530
They're on a goddamn rampage.
Kids today are fucking with an ease that

4009
02:51:58,531 --> 02:52:03,531
we've never experienced before.
That's why it's good that they have 

4010
02:52:03,531 --> 02:52:03,531
that,
a hpv vaccination,

4011
02:52:04,140 --> 02:52:06,010
they can shoot that in them and then 
they can shoot loads of

4012
02:52:06,010 --> 02:52:07,900
each other and not worry anyone under 
26.

4013
02:52:07,901 --> 02:52:08,770
Right?
Something like that.

4014
02:52:08,860 --> 02:52:10,260
Anybody young,
uh,

4015
02:52:10,440 --> 02:52:12,730
they're to have sex should get that 
vaccine.

4016
02:52:12,770 --> 02:52:14,710
Oh yeah,
shit's bad that he hpv.

4017
02:52:14,711 --> 02:52:19,711
But that vaccine apparently with some 
folks this had given them adverse 

4018
02:52:19,711 --> 02:52:20,290
reactions.
There's a bunch of,

4019
02:52:20,460 --> 02:52:22,090
what I don't know.
Some people,

4020
02:52:22,091 --> 02:52:23,450
you know,
it's like any other medication,

4021
02:52:23,451 --> 02:52:26,260
some people just don't know.
They just get sick.

4022
02:52:26,540 --> 02:52:29,650
Some people get sick from it.
These vaccinations,

4023
02:52:29,651 --> 02:52:30,280
a tricky,
you know,

4024
02:52:30,310 --> 02:52:35,020
shandra is um,
dad got lyme disease from a,

4025
02:52:35,021 --> 02:52:40,021
um,
from a lot they had a vaccination for 

4026
02:52:40,021 --> 02:52:42,991
lyme disease,
but for a small percentage of the 

4027
02:52:42,991 --> 02:52:42,991
population that have a particular gene 
set up,

4028
02:52:42,991 --> 02:52:44,920
they would get lyme disease from the 
vaccination.

4029
02:52:45,850 --> 02:52:47,230
Wow.
That's fucked up.

4030
02:52:47,320 --> 02:52:50,200
The poor guy got lyme disease from a 
vaccination for lyme disease.

4031
02:52:50,390 --> 02:52:55,390
It wasn't a lot of people that got that,
but was enough that they pulled it from 

4032
02:52:55,390 --> 02:52:55,390
the market.

4033
02:52:55,390 --> 02:52:56,470
What's going on in Venezuela right now?
Yup.

4034
02:52:57,160 --> 02:52:57,850
It's crazy,
right?

4035
02:52:57,851 --> 02:52:58,670
It's crazy.
Right?

4036
02:52:58,720 --> 02:52:59,770
Time.
Early in the world,

4037
02:52:59,830 --> 02:53:04,830
millions of people on the street 
protesting against their government all 

4038
02:53:04,830 --> 02:53:05,200
over the world.
[inaudible] put up some pictures.

4039
02:53:05,240 --> 02:53:09,670
The Ukraine also believe that they are 
to Venezuela is not his people.

4040
02:53:09,880 --> 02:53:11,520
How dare you?
Well,

4041
02:53:11,890 --> 02:53:16,890
they're just tired of this.
A fucking really shitty setup that they 

4042
02:53:16,890 --> 02:53:19,750
have and a lot of these countries quit 
cheating us wrong what we want for once.

4043
02:53:19,960 --> 02:53:20,670
Yeah,
you.

4044
02:53:20,700 --> 02:53:23,920
You actually don't own us.
You don't have power over us.

4045
02:53:23,921 --> 02:53:27,070
We allow you,
we elect you to positions of control.

4046
02:53:27,190 --> 02:53:28,120
Elect you.
You don't.

4047
02:53:28,390 --> 02:53:33,390
You don't tell us what to do.
We tell you that you have power to do 

4048
02:53:33,390 --> 02:53:33,390
things,
but the system is so corrupt though.

4049
02:53:33,390 --> 02:53:35,500
It's Like that.
You can't do apply any leaders in there.

4050
02:53:35,501 --> 02:53:38,350
It'll always be corrupted.
Not everyone man,

4051
02:53:38,351 --> 02:53:40,130
but most system will get mad.

4052
02:53:40,210 --> 02:53:43,570
I think will also,
I think people until today,

4053
02:53:43,720 --> 02:53:45,760
until this year,
people have been.

4054
02:53:45,761 --> 02:53:47,740
I mean,
until this age,

4055
02:53:47,741 --> 02:53:49,360
I should say,
the age of the internet,

4056
02:53:49,480 --> 02:53:54,480
people have been able to get away with 
shit and not get in trouble with it and 

4057
02:53:54,480 --> 02:53:55,450
not have the word spread across the 
country with ronald reagan.

4058
02:53:55,451 --> 02:53:58,360
I'd have no recollection of that.
This is like the of it right now.

4059
02:53:58,361 --> 02:54:02,500
It's turned to this buyer versus a cost 
versus citizens.

4060
02:54:02,501 --> 02:54:03,520
Yeah.
Oh my god.

4061
02:54:03,521 --> 02:54:05,530
That's terrifying.
This is a movie man.

4062
02:54:05,770 --> 02:54:10,150
Shots going off light,
but know what?

4063
02:54:10,340 --> 02:54:12,070
Otherwise,
wow.

4064
02:54:12,071 --> 02:54:13,870
Look at this shit.
This is crazy.

4065
02:54:13,900 --> 02:54:16,510
This is live right now.
Venezuela is a fucking.

4066
02:54:16,570 --> 02:54:18,850
The writing.
They are turning against our government.

4067
02:54:18,910 --> 02:54:20,830
Imagine if you were living in Venezuela 
right now.

4068
02:54:20,831 --> 02:54:24,010
This is the apocalypse.
They have regular meetings on fire guys.

4069
02:54:24,011 --> 02:54:25,510
This is the chicago.
In 20 years,

4070
02:54:25,690 --> 02:54:29,200
everything's on fire and guns are going 
off and this is the government trying to

4071
02:54:29,201 --> 02:54:31,000
keep control of its citizens because 
they're [inaudible].

4072
02:54:31,030 --> 02:54:32,140
They're protested and said,
no,

4073
02:54:32,141 --> 02:54:33,820
no pro.
They outlaw protests,

4074
02:54:34,930 --> 02:54:36,870
protests.
You can't outlaw protests.

4075
02:54:36,880 --> 02:54:38,980
He fucks and I start getting violent 
because I just want to say,

4076
02:54:39,010 --> 02:54:39,960
don't do this.
Yeah,

4077
02:54:39,961 --> 02:54:42,940
well they're.
They're living under a totalitarian,

4078
02:54:42,941 --> 02:54:47,941
dictator's block and twitter feed.
If You post pictures on twitter that 

4079
02:54:47,941 --> 02:54:47,941
blocking a lot of them.
Yeah,

4080
02:54:48,610 --> 02:54:49,690
it's terrifying shit,
man.

4081
02:54:50,050 --> 02:54:55,050
You know what?
All these monarchs and all these kings 

4082
02:54:55,050 --> 02:54:58,981
and all these people that run countries 
are terrified of this kind of shit 

4083
02:54:58,981 --> 02:55:01,651
happening.
All these prime ministers or whatever 

4084
02:55:01,651 --> 02:55:05,191
their title is,
people in positions of power call them 

4085
02:55:05,191 --> 02:55:05,191
whatever the fuck that was,

4086
02:55:05,191 --> 02:55:08,060
but you see that all these people are 
terrified of losing this.

4087
02:55:08,061 --> 02:55:13,061
They're terrified of losing their 
ability control to control these people 

4088
02:55:13,061 --> 02:55:14,840
and they get used to that feeling of 
power.

4089
02:55:14,841 --> 02:55:17,930
They feel like they deserve it the same 
way we were talking about earlier,

4090
02:55:17,931 --> 02:55:22,931
like ridiculous.
Celebrities think that everyone is 

4091
02:55:22,931 --> 02:55:23,000
supposed to kiss their ass because they 
don't look at themselves.

4092
02:55:23,060 --> 02:55:24,470
These people don't look at themselves 
either.

4093
02:55:24,471 --> 02:55:29,471
Just dominate these people.
People who support America going into 

4094
02:55:29,471 --> 02:55:29,471
like Syria or something like that and 
they're like,

4095
02:55:29,471 --> 02:55:30,320
well,
we got to do something,

4096
02:55:30,710 --> 02:55:34,640
and my thought is if there were dirty 
dishes in the dish in the sink,

4097
02:55:35,060 --> 02:55:40,060
you don't send a spastic toddler in 
there to watch it because they'll smash 

4098
02:55:40,060 --> 02:55:40,060
a bunch of dishes and you're be like,
well,

4099
02:55:40,060 --> 02:55:41,090
we can't just leave the dishes dirty 
like,

4100
02:55:41,091 --> 02:55:43,240
well,
we to send in somebody like that toddler

4101
02:55:43,250 --> 02:55:44,300
is the wrong guy to sit in.

4102
02:55:44,710 --> 02:55:47,920
America is proven to have just no,
there's no death,

4103
02:55:48,020 --> 02:55:49,900
but who else would you send in if you're
going to get rid of?

4104
02:55:50,260 --> 02:55:53,450
Literally not the ones we just spread 
death to every country we go into.

4105
02:55:53,500 --> 02:55:54,220
Yeah,
but if you want to.

4106
02:55:54,450 --> 02:55:54,890
Okay,
look,

4107
02:55:54,891 --> 02:55:59,891
I'm not.
I don't buy the what's going on in 

4108
02:55:59,891 --> 02:56:02,381
Syria.
I don't buy us that we need to invade 

4109
02:56:02,381 --> 02:56:02,381
Syria.
I think it's a very complicated,

4110
02:56:02,381 --> 02:56:06,220
gigantic mess,
but if you're going to say that someone 

4111
02:56:06,220 --> 02:56:06,560
needed to invade,
Syria will tell you.

4112
02:56:06,690 --> 02:56:09,920
Would it be except us.
The only superpower in the.

4113
02:56:09,921 --> 02:56:14,060
We've only made more suffering and death
everywhere else we've gone.

4114
02:56:14,061 --> 02:56:16,620
We're getting better at it already.
Okay.

4115
02:56:16,640 --> 02:56:18,890
It takes like a joke.
It takes a lot of practice.

4116
02:56:19,190 --> 02:56:24,190
You gotta keep dominating worlds for a 
long time before you get it right to 

4117
02:56:24,190 --> 02:56:28,490
point.
You can be really nice while you're 

4118
02:56:28,490 --> 02:56:28,490
doing it.
I'm doing a piece

4119
02:56:28,570 --> 02:56:30,740
already.
Should fear on twitter a r I,

4120

f I r,

4121

4128

Um,

4134
02:57:14,660 --> 02:57:17,030
Let me just say I would reject that 
anyway.

4135
02:57:17,031 --> 02:57:19,370
I hate miami.
How dare cities.

tinder.

Skinny ass fucking just chaos.
