1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,850
Five,
four,

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,560
three,
two,

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,980
one.
Boom,

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,060
boom.
Adam,

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,380
what's up man?
How you doing?

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,390
It's good to be here today.
It's good to be here too with you and to

7
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,880
talk knocking shit over there.
Can't be trusted.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,360
Your book.
Alien worlds and the fate of the earth.

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,350
All about it.
That's deep shit,

10
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:29,130
man.
Just the,

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,930
just the title alone.
Like,

12
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,730
whoa.
I love aliens.

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,470
Everybody loves aliens.
Everybody does.

14
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:39,471
But what are your thoughts on actual 
aliens and whether or not they've ever 

15
00:00:39,471 --> 00:00:39,660
visited here?
Yeah,

16
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:41,450
it's interesting because uh,
you know,

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,150
sorta two things.
So first of all we should tell everybody

18
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:46,950
you have a background in science.
I do.

19
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:49,500
I'm an astrophysicist at the University 
of Rochester.

20
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:52,500
I run a research group that studies like
stars and planets.

21
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:54,240
And so you're not a crazy person I 
brought on here.

22
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:54,750
No,
no,

23
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:56,610
no.
I'm a card carrying scientists.

24
00:00:56,611 --> 00:00:57,780
I got my card and everything.

25
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,070
Um,
so yeah,

26
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,640
I've been doing research on astronomy,
astrophysics for a long time,

27
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:05,640
but I also do all this popular writing 
like for Npr,

28
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,640
New York Times.
And the genesis of this book came a 

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:10,640
because I love science fiction.
Been reading science fiction since I was

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,250
a kid,
uh,

31
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:16,251
but also I do a lot of work on climate 
change and so I do a lot of climate 

32
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:19,461
change denial.
And what I realized was that there's 

33
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:22,041
this way we talk about it that is like 
completely forgets about the fact that 

34
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:22,650
like,
we're probably not the first,

35
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,040
you know,
and uh,

36
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:27,120
that led me to a whole bunch of research
that eventually led to this book,

37
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,150
you know,
including one paper that we did that 

38
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:32,820
showed that the odds that we're the only
time it's ever happened,

39
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:37,890
only you know,
the only civilization in the entire 

40
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:37,890
history of the universe.

41
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,510
The only way that that could be true is 
if,

42
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:44,530
uh,
the odds per planet are one in 10 

43
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:44,550
billion trillion,
right?

44
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,960
That's pretty low,
right?

45
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:46,500
So,
you know,

46
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,060
the,
you know,

47
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,310
the odds of anything being one in 10 
billion trillion at pretty freaking low.

48
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,340
So,
um,

49
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,220
it's probably happened before,
you know,

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,560
there's been other civilizations before 
ours.

51
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,900
And once you realize that man that is 
like,

52
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,930
you know,
changes everything about how we think 

53
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:02,930
about ourselves,
you know,

54
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,750
and what's happening to us right now.
So other civilizations before ours that 

55
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,910
have fucked things up.
Well that's kind of the premise,

56
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:09,570
right?
So that's what,

57
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:11,280
you know,
when you look at climate change,

58
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:12,710
right?
Basically what we it is,

59
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:16,830
is civilizations are giant machines for 
turning energy into work,

60
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:17,580
right?
You know,

61
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:18,870
New York City,
right?

62
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:20,460
You sit over and you look at Manhattan,
you're like,

63
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:23,190
Holy Shit,
there's all this energy flowing into it.

64
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,170
And then there's all this work being 
done,

65
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:26,550
you know,
to keep everything moving.

66
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:27,780
And uh,
you know,

67
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:31,380
there's no way not to have an impact if 
you build a world girdling civilization,

68
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:31,830
which,
you know,

69
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:34,380
that's what a civilization is.
There's going to be impact.

70
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:39,381
So the whole point of my doing this book
was to start looking at ourselves as 

71
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:41,310
just one of,
you know,

72
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,470
we're not alone,
right?

73
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,910
The only time this has ever happened 
doesn't mean anybody's around now,

74
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:47,390
like that's a different question.
But the idea that like,

75
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,330
it's never happened before.
It meaning like,

76
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:49,930
you know,
you know,

77
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,640
civilization what's happening around us,
like these machinery and everything that

78
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:54,090
um,
you know,

79
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:59,091
that just in the new world of what we 
understand about planets and shit that 

80
00:02:59,091 --> 00:02:59,091
is just like,
you know,

81
00:02:59,091 --> 00:03:03,290
it's not tenable anymore.
We got to wake up the idea that some 

82
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,470
civilization has to be the first one.

83
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:10,510
That's the only.
The only way you could ever think that 

84
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,790
we're the only ones is that some 
civilization has to be the first one.

85
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,400
Even in a universe that's infinite.
Yeah,

86
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,480
it has to happen one time.
But the ideas are the conditions ideal 

87
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,840
in a trillion different spots all over 
the,

88
00:03:24,841 --> 00:03:28,540
the infinite spanse of the universe.
And that's the thing,

89
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,350
right?
So what we've learned,

90
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,690
so you know,
one of my trips right now is like,

91
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:33,400
this is not your grandfather's steady 
anymore,

92
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:34,570
right?
Our understanding,

93
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,840
we went through this major revolution in
our understanding of what planets about 

94
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,120
20 years ago.
So he looked back at the Greeks,

95
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:45,121
right?
And you can see them arguing about when 

96
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:46,591
he were there.
Any other stars have planets other than 

97
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:46,591
the sun.
And you know,

98
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:47,510
it goes back and forth,
you know,

99
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,700
some of the Greeks were like,
yeah,

100
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:49,540
it's definitely happening.

101
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,650
And then like,
aristotle was like,

102
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:52,240
no,
we're the only world in this whole,

103
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:56,170
in the whole universe that has life.
And then as time goes on,

104
00:03:56,171 --> 00:04:01,171
it kind of goes back and forth.
And even at the turn of the last of 

105
00:04:01,171 --> 00:04:01,171
this,
uh,

106
00:04:01,171 --> 00:04:04,210
the 19th century,
people thought planets were incredibly 

107
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:04,210
rare that like,
they all,

108
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,531
they thought the only way you can get a 
planet with two stars past really close 

109
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:10,231
to each other and they kind of like 
taffy pulled out stuff that will 

110
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:12,871
eventually form a planet.
And the lots of those kinds of 

111
00:04:12,871 --> 00:04:12,871
collisions are so small that people were
like,

112
00:04:12,871 --> 00:04:14,000
you know what,
there's just no planets and no plan.

113
00:04:14,001 --> 00:04:14,740
It's no life,
you know,

114
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:16,060
unless something really freaky is going 
on.

115
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,380
But then 20 years ago we discovered our 
first planet orbiting that crazy.

116
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:23,920
When you really think about that,
20 years is such a short amount of time.

117
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,250
Nineteen 98.
Yeah.

118
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,090
Yeah.
And nobody knew before that,

119
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,250
like nobody knew whether there were any 
planets.

120
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:30,550
Right.
You know,

121
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:31,900
when I was starting to drive,
people are like,

122
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:36,901
well,
we don't know whether there's going to 

123
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:36,901
be any other planets,
and we went from a to z.

124
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:37,590
The first one was actually 96,
I think [inaudible] 95,

125
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,480
96.
Uh,

126
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,560
from that to now where we know that 
every fricking star in the sky had the 

127
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,440
planet at least one,
you know,

128
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,780
pretty much everyone pretty.
I mean,

129
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:48,250
the big giant ones,
maybe not,

130
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:53,251
but they're so rare that you know,
pretty much every star you see in the 

131
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,850
sky has a family of planets around it.
That is so nuts.

132
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,130
It's so nice that this is such a new 
discovery.

133
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,180
Yeah.
I mean,

134
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,640
when we think about what we know about 
the universe,

135
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:03,670
we think that we've had a pretty good 
understanding of it for a long time.

136
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,780
Right.
But the fact that we didn't even know 

137
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:08,780
for sure that there are planets,
right?

138
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,010
Right.
In my own lifetime,

139
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,040
you know,
people were teaching me when I was 

140
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,040
starting,
you know,

141
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,250
we just don't know.
Maybe they're rare and now we know for 

142
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,571
certain that they're everywhere.
And I think people have to realize is 

143
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:18,610
every one of those planets is a place,
you know what I mean?

144
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:23,790
It's a place you could walk around,
some of them for sure are going to have 

145
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:23,790
oceans,
there's going to be mountains,

146
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,910
it's going to be rain falling,
you know,

147
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:29,911
I mean like they're all freaking places 
and they're all places where things can 

148
00:05:29,911 --> 00:05:30,610
happen.
You know,

149
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:35,611
planets are basically like nature's way 
of taking sunlight and doing something 

150
00:05:35,611 --> 00:05:39,181
interesting with it.
So you have 10 billion trillion planets 

151
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,330
in the universe,
right?

152
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:42,700
And every one of them is an experiment 
that's being run.

153
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,110
So you know,
the idea that like,

154
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:49,290
we're the first time it's out now that 
we know that right now that we've gone 

155
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:49,690
through that revolution and understand 
that planets are like,

156
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,780
diamond doesn't planets.
Now we're not only talking about 

157
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,121
planetary,
we're talking what plants are in the 

158
00:05:57,121 --> 00:05:58,201
right place for life to form.
So there's the idea of the habitable 

159
00:05:58,201 --> 00:05:58,201
zone,
right?

160
00:05:58,201 --> 00:05:58,201
So,
you know,

161
00:05:58,201 --> 00:05:58,520
mercury sucks.
You cannot,

162
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,550
you know,
mercury so hot that there no way 

163
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:03,550
anything's going to happen.
And you know,

164
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,761
planets that are far,
far enough out there going to be so 

165
00:06:06,761 --> 00:06:06,761
cold,
you know,

166
00:06:06,761 --> 00:06:07,130
they're so far away from their star that
they're gonna be so cold that,

167
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:12,270
you know,
it's hard to get liquid water on the 

168
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,811
surface.
So we defined the habitable or 

169
00:06:13,811 --> 00:06:13,970
goldilocks zone is the place where you 
can have,

170
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:18,971
you can pour water onto the surface and 
they'll just sit there and will freeze 

171
00:06:18,971 --> 00:06:18,971
and it will sort of just evaporate away.

172
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,030
So,
uh,

173
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,360
all these 10 billion trillion planets 
I'm talking about are all in the right 

174
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,360
place for life to form,
you know.

175
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,610
And so like with that many numbers that 
many experiments being run,

176
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:33,611
like you got to be a psychotic 
pessimists to say that like this is the 

177
00:06:33,611 --> 00:06:33,980
only time a civilization has ever 
happened.

178
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,100
Right?
But there's still no evidence yet.

179
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,160
Obviously we didn't even know that 
they're really absolutely were planets 

180
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,640
until 20 years ago.
Right.

181
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,350
But we don't know for sure that there's 
something else out there.

182
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,040
No,
no.

183
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:51,070
This is an argument by a,
I call it like an argument by 

184
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:51,070
exhaustion.
You know,

185
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,491
if I gave you a bag of 10 billion 
trillion planets and you have to sort 

186
00:06:54,491 --> 00:06:54,491
through all of them,
right?

187
00:06:54,491 --> 00:06:56,780
The odds that you're gonna you're never 
gonna find another one that,

188
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,790
that built a civilization is now,
you know,

189
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:03,791
like I said,
you're really asking for really serious 

190
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:03,791
pessimism,
but you know,

191
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:03,791
we're just getting started with this 
game,

192
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,600
right,
of looking for life.

193
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:10,690
That's why I keep saying it's not,
this is not your grandfather's said 

194
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:10,690
where you're like you're pointing,
you know,

195
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,600
a radio telescope at a star and you kind
of wait to see whether somebody signal 

196
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,850
signaling you who knows whether they are
signaling who knows what they'd be 

197
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:17,850
using.
Now,

198
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,671
what we can do,
because we got all these planets to 

199
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:21,671
stare at his,
you know,

200
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:23,300
we're going to be able to like stare at 
them as they pass in front of their star

201
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,550
and get the light that passes through 
their atmosphere.

202
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,410
So we're going to like,
who knows what we're going to find,

203
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:32,411
you know,
we're not waiting for them to signal us 

204
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:32,411
anymore over the next.
I swear to God,

205
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:33,440
man,
in the next 30 years we're going to have

206
00:07:33,441 --> 00:07:36,770
data relevant to the question of life,
maybe not civilization,

207
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:39,950
so that could happen too,
but just life on other worlds,

208
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:45,010
you know,
and we've never had that for all the 

209
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,481
arguments for the entire history of 
humanity have just been two dudes 

210
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:46,481
yelling at each other.

211
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:49,830
Right?
But in the next 30 years because the 

212
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,830
stuff we're building and now that we 
know there's,

213
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,830
there's,
uh,

214
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,830
uh,
planets,

215
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,470
we're going to have real data to argue 
over with.

216
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,660
So now it's like this is where we're in 
a whole nother ballgame.

217
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,840
Now.
I think the big fear for a lot of people

218
00:07:56,841 --> 00:08:01,841
is what happens when we find out for 
sure that there's something else out 

219
00:08:01,841 --> 00:08:04,991
there.
If we really do find like some other 

220
00:08:04,991 --> 00:08:06,430
Manhattan on some goldilocks planet,
yeah,

221
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,560
it's hovering some similarly sized star,
a billion light years away or whatever 

222
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,490
the hell it is,
that's going to be very,

223
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:15,020
very,
very strange.

224
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,670
It will be,
it'll be a game changer,

225
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:17,840
right?
Because for religions,

226
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:18,740
for,
you know,

227
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:19,700
I mean,
wow,

228
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:24,730
you know,
what do you do if you find other 

229
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:24,730
intelligent creatures were building 
civilization,

230
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,740
started making them pay taxes.
That's what you do.

231
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,660
You Go,
you know,

232
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,110
get pissed off that they're not doing 
what you want them to do.

233
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,230
You should be believing this bunk,
you know,

234
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,200
so,
uh,

235
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:33,760
but I think,
you know,

236
00:08:33,761 --> 00:08:38,761
for me the thing is like it's about 
climate change because what it means is 

237
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:39,110
like there's no way.
But from my perspective,

238
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,030
you know,
that,

239
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,620
that if you have a civilization,
you push your planet,

240
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,950
you can't stop it in some sense of your 
build a civilization.

241
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:50,951
It's,
well the only way around that is if you 

242
00:08:50,951 --> 00:08:53,081
have like a subsistence culture,
indigenous native American culture,

243
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,480
right?
Which it seems impossible,

244
00:08:57,481 --> 00:09:01,180
but it existed here 200 years ago,
which is a blink of an eye.

245
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,430
I know.
It's amazing.

246
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:07,431
It's only 200 years since the ramp up 
your that the world population only 

247
00:09:07,431 --> 00:09:09,570
crossed up the billion mark and like 
1850,

248
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:15,070
you know,
I mean there were so few of us on the 

249
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:15,070
planet for most of the time that you've 
been.

250
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:15,870
We've been around.
Forget the planet's history.

251
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,280
Uh,
so,

252
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:19,650
you know,
I think like there is no discovery if we

253
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:21,940
were to get any evidence you don't want 
to.

254
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:26,950
I think the way it's going to happen is 
going to be more by accident than by 

255
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:26,950
like signaling,
you know,

256
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,390
like the.
So,

257
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:32,420
so,
but if we had any evidence of another 

258
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:32,420
technological forget any evidence of 
just life,

259
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,290
right?
If we just find a biosphere evidence 

260
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:36,290
that,
you know,

261
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:36,290
and we can do that from a distance,
right?

262
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:36,290
I,
even,

263
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,350
if the star is,
you know,

264
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,690
30 light years away,
if we get,

265
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:44,691
if we see as the light passes through 
the star's atmosphere for those few 

266
00:09:44,691 --> 00:09:46,170
moments,
if we see oxygen in the atmosphere,

267
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:47,190
you know,
will be able to attack that.

268
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:52,191
That's what we can do with telescopes.
We can tell like what you can see the 

269
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:52,191
fingerprints of the different kinds of 
elements.

270
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,480
If we see oxygen in the atmosphere,
you know,

271
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:57,390
and methane that pretty much says that 
there's a biosphere there,

272
00:09:57,391 --> 00:09:58,950
that there's life because you wouldn't 
get oxygen,

273
00:09:58,951 --> 00:10:01,770
would just react away really fast if it 
wasn't for life like in our,

274
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:02,280
on,
uh,

275
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,050
on earth.
It wasn't for life.

276
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:09,350
There'd be no oxygen in the atmosphere.
What are the possibilities of life that 

277
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,650
exists in a completely different 
environment than we expect.

278
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:15,730
Like I know that they found life at the 
bottom of the ocean is volcanic events 

279
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:20,350
at extreme heats,
boiling water that didn't expect to see 

280
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:20,350
this.
And this is fairly recent as well.

281
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:20,890
That is that.
Yeah,

282
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,950
the idea that the.
Because right.

283
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:25,800
This whole definition of the habitable 
zone was based on the idea like,

284
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:30,830
oh,
you got to have a surface and it's got 

285
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:30,830
to be,
you know,

286
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:30,830
but now with the,
every,

287
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,780
not every but like a bunch of the moons 
orbiting Jupiter and Saturn,

288
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,760
the gas giants,
they have oceans under them.

289
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,150
Like,
well,

290
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:38,970
this thoughts that you rope up might 
have something below the surface,

291
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,240
right?
Yeah.

292
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:44,241
Yeah.
Because the Europa is a pretty big moon 

293
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:44,940
and we know it's covered in ice,
right?

294
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:46,100
You can see it's covered in it,
you know,

295
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,630
and we think that layer of ice is maybe 
like,

296
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,640
I don't know,
10 kilometers thick and then below that 

297
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,190
there may be 100 kilometers of ocean and
because as it moves around Jupiter,

298
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:58,191
it's con the gravity of Jupiter.
So squishing the insights at this 

299
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:58,191
probably volcanic activity happening at 
the surface.

300
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,970
So you have hydrothermal vents,
you know,

301
00:10:59,971 --> 00:11:04,971
heat escaping out of then chemicals 
escaping out of the surface under the 

302
00:11:04,971 --> 00:11:08,631
ocean.
And that's how we think life form on 

303
00:11:08,631 --> 00:11:08,631
earth.
That's one of the arguments for how life

304
00:11:08,631 --> 00:11:10,020
forms from formed first in the 
hydrothermal vents.

305
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,870
So yeah,
it's a new day.

306
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,200
That's another game changer,
right?

307
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,110
So that we should also be thinking not 
just about the,

308
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,780
the classic,
uh,

309
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,900
the habitable zone,
but now we've got to think about like 

310
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:21,900
life and can you get civilizations in an
underwater civilization?

311
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,740
You know,
in an underwater you,

312
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:25,150
maybe you have a really rich ecosystem,
but you know,

313
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,380
with the problem with a,
uh,

314
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:31,420
you know,
an underwater life or forming 

315
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:31,860
civilization is that you can't really do
fire.

316
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,480
Right.
Fire was pretty important for us.

317
00:11:33,481 --> 00:11:34,410
For metallurgy,
you know,

318
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:37,860
to build advanced technology,
you kind of need combustion.

319
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,770
So,
you know,

320
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,110
that's kind of the open question with 
that.

321
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,110
Yeah.
We're not really concerned with animals.

322
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,020
We're concerned with things that think 
and change their environment.

323
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,540
There isn't that weird.
Like we are concerned with life,

324
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:52,350
but we're only concerned with life 
that's it least similar or comparable to

325
00:11:52,351 --> 00:11:54,020
us.
Microbes don't like.

326
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:54,850
We don't.
Yeah,

327
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,060
we don't that I'm going to go to Jupiter
for some microbes,

328
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,630
but we are excited about the things that
they've recently found on Mars.

329
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,790
Right.
I mean there's a very recent discovery,

330
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:04,300
right?
Yeah.

331
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,080
So,
you know,

332
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:06,130
the thing is actually from the,
you know,

333
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,440
so I'm gonna I,
I worked in a lot of fields,

334
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:10,780
but I would also consider myself an 
astrobiologist.

335
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:15,781
Right.
Which is a pretty kind of a wild idea 

336
00:12:15,781 --> 00:12:15,781
that you can do astrobiology even though
you only have one example,

337
00:12:15,781 --> 00:12:17,650
which is the earth,
but we've learned so much and now we can

338
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:20,140
start asking ourselves about the 
possibility of life elsewhere.

339
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,350
So finding even a microbe like even a 
frigging,

340
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,510
you know,
Amoeba on Mars would be,

341
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,360
or even evidence that there used to be 
a,

342
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,800
but what is the evidence that they've 
discovered on Mars?

343
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,380
What they found was um,
organic chemistry,

344
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,690
right?
And so our better organic chemistry man,

345
00:12:34,691 --> 00:12:37,040
I hated chemistry when I was growing up 
and I hated,

346
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,660
or was that just basically chemistry 
involved in carbon,

347
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,260
you know,
so you can have non or organic chemistry

348
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:49,261
doesn't mean organisms,
but it's the kind of chemistry that 

349
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:49,261
organisms live.

350
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:53,160
Right?
So finding evidence that there was like 

351
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,020
they drilled nice and we sent a freaking
robot cars that could drill through a 

352
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,020
rock,
you know,

353
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,120
and then ingest the rocket and then send
the data back.

354
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,250
Cross space.
We're pretty good for a bunch of 

355
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:04,250
hairless apes.
Um,

356
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:09,120
so what,
what they found was evidence for fairly 

357
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,120
complex.
Um,

358
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,400
uh,
you know,

359
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,990
uh,
organic chemistry,

360
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,720
which meant that way back when Mars and 
this,

361
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:14,440
we know for sure,
right?

362
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:19,441
Mars had water on it.
We know that for sure now Mars was a 

363
00:13:19,441 --> 00:13:22,201
blue planet for Mars was hit by an 
asteroid or comet or something along 

364
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:23,890
those lines.
Everything got hit by comments.

365
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:24,490
That's how we have,
you know,

366
00:13:24,491 --> 00:13:26,050
we have chunks of Mars here,
right?

367
00:13:26,051 --> 00:13:26,380
That,
you know,

368
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:28,150
the thing in [inaudible] 96 or whatever,
when they were like,

369
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:29,560
ah,
we found life on Mars,

370
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:34,561
you know,
they thought that what they found was a 

371
00:13:34,561 --> 00:13:35,170
fossil bacteria in a chunk of Mars that 
they found in Antarctica.

372
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:38,740
So the planets have been swapping spit 
for like the entire history of the solar

373
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,870
systems,
fossilized bacteria that they found.

374
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:45,871
Is that been confirmed that most people 
now think that the Allen hills a 

375
00:13:45,871 --> 00:13:46,510
meteorite,
that probably,

376
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:47,680
you know,
it's inconclusive,

377
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:49,240
but it's not conclusive enough to be 
like,

378
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:49,990
yeah,
we found life.

379
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,870
It's like a tiny little squiggly worm.
Look,

380
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,780
that's what it was.
Yeah.

381
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:57,781
But it was so small that it was like 
waist smaller than any of the 

382
00:13:57,781 --> 00:13:57,781
microscopic fossilized bacteria we've 
ever seen before.

383
00:13:57,781 --> 00:14:00,230
So people in general are like me.
Um,

384
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,990
but by fine.
But that's what started,

385
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:03,760
right.
That's when Clinton was like,

386
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:08,761
okay,
we're going to send a lot of shit to 

387
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:08,761
Mars because after I went back in 
[inaudible] 90 [inaudible],

388
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:09,160
early nineties,
people were kind of done with Mars.

389
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,990
And so that's what triggered the whole,
you know,

390
00:14:10,991 --> 00:14:14,000
one space probe after another,
the rovers and like,

391
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:14,530
so,
you know,

392
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:17,110
the thing we found was a direct result 
of that effort,

393
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:22,060
which was this organic chemistry which 
says that back in the day Morris had had

394
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,100
a lot of this stuff lying around,
had a lot of these,

395
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:24,670
you know,
these,

396
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:27,490
these organic chemicals line around 
which if your life,

397
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,870
that's what you're going to be using.

398
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,990
So that's like one more step.
Like we've been putting the Lego blocks 

399
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,790
for the argument for life on Mars one 
piece at a time since the.

400
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,280
Since the first rovers went there.
Yeah.

401
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,600
If we did discover just even plants on 
some other planet,

402
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:47,740
even just a planet with some sort of 
plant life,

403
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,770
that would be,
that'd be a game changer,

404
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,780
game changer.
Because right now we don't know if 

405
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:54,780
there's,
we,

406
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,180
you know,
are we the only time in the entire 

407
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:57,890
history of the universe that like this 
crazy thing where you got,

408
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,920
we went from non life to life.
Like is that common or is that never 

409
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,440
ever,
ever happened?

410
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,760
So that's the question we want to.
We want to answer.

411
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:06,100
And I,
you know,

412
00:15:06,101 --> 00:15:06,640
I mean,
you know,

413
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,740
that argument was given before is I 
think from the probable arguments.

414
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:10,820
I'm saying it's like,
you know,

415
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:15,821
it's,
it's almost overwhelming that you had 

416
00:15:15,821 --> 00:15:15,821
probably happened somewhere.

417
00:15:15,821 --> 00:15:15,821
Again,
doesn't mean anything here,

418
00:15:15,821 --> 00:15:16,040
but we need evidence,
right?

419
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,200
Science.
So we got to build that evidence.

420
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,050
Yeah.
And if we do find something,

421
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,470
the,
the,

422
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:26,580
one of the weirder things would be if we
found something and there was a way to 

423
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:26,930
get there.
Yeah.

424
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:27,720
You know,
we,

425
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,330
we find something and we're like,
yeah,

426
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:30,530
we find something,
but it's,

427
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,490
we're pretty sure there's some kind of 
life and its 3 billion light years away.

428
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:34,850
Like,
wow,

429
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:35,930
that's cool.
Yeah,

430
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:36,760
what do we do?
Yeah,

431
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,230
it's nice to know that we're not the 
only ones.

432
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,610
You know.
It's interesting.

433
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:42,260
Like how much would that change,
you know,

434
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:45,170
even if we found evidence for this,
this is a debate,

435
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:50,171
like if we found evidence of a 
technological civilization we saw like 

436
00:15:50,171 --> 00:15:50,350
alien mega structures like that star,
they felt that.

437
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,010
What was that nonsense really nonsense.
It was something floating around.

438
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,240
Right?
So here's what they saw so that,

439
00:15:56,241 --> 00:16:01,241
you know,
the way we discover planets is we look 

440
00:16:01,241 --> 00:16:01,790
for when the planet passes in front of 
the star,

441
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,160
you get a little dip in the light,
right?

442
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,150
It blocks out a little bit of light to 
the little eclipse.

443
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,140
Um,
and so,

444
00:16:06,141 --> 00:16:06,860
you know,
we've now,

445
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,230
that's how we know that every star in 
the sky has planets,

446
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,080
but there is like they found one that 
just made no sense,

447
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:17,110
like the light would dip.
Then what stopped dip and then we'll 

448
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,110
begin three times and it stopped 
dripping.

449
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,560
Sometimes it was lower,
sometimes it was higher and you know,

450
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,090
for a year.
So people were like,

451
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,890
fuck it,
you know.

452
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,090
And so,
you know,

453
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:23,770
um,
uh,

454
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,790
Jason Wright and others,
Jason's a friend of mine,

455
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:26,930
you know,
they wrote a paper where they were like,

456
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,280
hey,
you know,

457
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:30,260
at least because this is what the 
future's going gonna look like.

458
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:35,260
We can't say we can't.
We have to at least consider the 

459
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,690
possibility that these are artificial 
structures that are orbiting the star or

460
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,980
you know,
have to be ungodly,

461
00:16:39,981 --> 00:16:40,940
huge,
ungodly,

462
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:45,941
huge alien mega structures.
Like that's the best word for like the 

463
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:45,941
size of a country,
right?

464
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:45,941
Yeah,
yeah.

465
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:46,790
These things would be huge,
right?

466
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,040
But that's what people think.
Like,

467
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:53,050
you know,
when people think about advanced alien 

468
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,791
civilization,
the idea of building large scale 

469
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:58,150
structures is you think that maybe the 
next thing you do once you reach a 

470
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,150
certain point,
like,

471
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,150
um,
you know,

472
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:02,861
the dyson sphere,
the idea that you could collect all of 

473
00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:05,531
the sun's energy and use it for yourself
by building a giant sphere around the 

474
00:17:05,531 --> 00:17:08,420
sun with solar panels on the inside.
People think like it goes back to Carter

475
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:13,450
chefs,
the idea of this Carter chef scale back 

476
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:13,450
in the sixties where he's like,
look,

477
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,721
there's going to be a natural 
progression of civilizations that goes 

478
00:17:16,721 --> 00:17:16,721
first.

479
00:17:16,721 --> 00:17:19,870
You collect all the energy you can from 
your planet and then you use that to do 

480
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,021
amazing things and then you collect all 
the energy from your star and then you 

481
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:23,021
do that,
do amazing shit with that.

482
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:23,960
And then,
you know,

483
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,340
the whole galaxy.
So he,

484
00:17:25,341 --> 00:17:30,341
you know,
Carter Chef thought there was a scale 

485
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:30,341
that civilizations naturally progress 
through.

486
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:31,910
So hopefully you don't blow yourself up 
along the way.

487
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,930
Well,
I think that's the question.

488
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:37,931
I mean,
I've criticized the car chef scale in 

489
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,091
one of the papers I recently did because
what it fails to take into account is 

490
00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:40,091
the fact that like,
you know,

491
00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:43,751
on your way up to the type one type one 
is when you harvest all the energy from 

492
00:17:43,751 --> 00:17:47,621
your planet,
which basically means somehow covering 

493
00:17:47,621 --> 00:17:50,470
your planet in our solar panels or 
something that neglects what we've 

494
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,840
learned since Carter Chef wrote his 
paper in 64 is that,

495
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:53,160
you know,
planets don't like that shit.

496
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,570
Like planets.
The plan's gonna feed back.

497
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:56,090
You try and build,
you know,

498
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:01,100
massive shit on your planet.
The planet has its own biosphere is 

499
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:01,610
pretty powerful and you've got to take 
the biosphere in the counter,

500
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,620
you get climate change,
you get the planet being pushed off in 

501
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:06,620
another direction.
So,

502
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:06,620
but whatever.
So for the,

503
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,310
um,
for the alien mega structures,

504
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:08,820
people thought like,
well,

505
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,460
maybe this is like a piece of it.
Have a dyson sphere,

506
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:12,150
right?
This is like,

507
00:18:12,151 --> 00:18:13,050
you know,
now.

508
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:13,530
So,
you know,

509
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:16,200
when he proposed this,
people went bonkers over this,

510
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:16,920
right?
He was just saying,

511
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:17,520
he's like,
look,

512
00:18:17,521 --> 00:18:19,080
here's the 15 different things.
Could be,

513
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:24,081
and I'm going to have to at least 
consider the possibility that it's 

514
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:24,081
artificial,
um,

515
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:25,740
but for me and some people got really 
angry everything,

516
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:30,750
but I felt like this,
they get angry because there's been a 

517
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,390
thing in the community over the years,
you know,

518
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,970
said he got a bad name,
right.

519
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,400
Setting for a bunch of people.
It was sort of thought as being like,

520
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:37,770
oh,
only whackadoodles do that and why?

521
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,750
Why is that?
Just because there was no results.

522
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,570
I just think,
you know,

523
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:42,700
I,
you know,

524
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,220
it is,
it's because of Shitty TV,

525
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,050
you know,
I mean,

526
00:18:45,051 --> 00:18:46,080
I really in some ways,
right?

527
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:46,860
It's all,
you know,

528
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:48,210
it's prosthetic foreheads,
right?

529
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:51,150
It's the whole.
We've had so much kind of crappy,

530
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,100
you know,
speculation about aliens.

531
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:57,180
I trying to do anything scientific.
Always had this whiff of sort of being a

532
00:18:57,181 --> 00:18:58,010
little,
you know.

533
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,510
And then there's the Ufo stuff which is 
completely separate.

534
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:01,230
It's nothing to do with it.

535
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,770
He said he never really achieved any 
results.

536
00:19:04,771 --> 00:19:09,771
Right.
There was that one big blip that was 

537
00:19:09,771 --> 00:19:09,771
highly popular items.

538
00:19:09,771 --> 00:19:09,771
Wow.
Signal.

539
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,020
But here's the thing about setting,
we never really did set that much,

540
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,370
you know what I mean?
Like people have this idea like,

541
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:19,371
wow,
we've got telescopes all over the world 

542
00:19:19,371 --> 00:19:19,371
and they're looking,
you know,

543
00:19:19,371 --> 00:19:21,210
so the government never funded a study 
study anything major,

544
00:19:21,211 --> 00:19:21,870
right.
So people,

545
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:26,890
you know,
all that study has done is like 

546
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:26,890
basically,
you know,

547
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:27,300
some dudes on a telescope get a little 
extra time like,

548
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:28,800
hey man,
let's go look at a star.

549
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,820
Right.
So,

550
00:19:29,821 --> 00:19:30,810
um,
Jill Tarter,

551
00:19:30,811 --> 00:19:34,020
who's one of the founders,
one of the greats of Sadie,

552
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,150
she compares it.
It's like,

553
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:40,160
you know,
we've got an ocean that we need to look 

554
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,160
at and which.
So far we've looked at a thimble,

555
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,160
right.
And she,

556
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,621
the Jodie foster care,
she's the jody foster character yet 

557
00:19:44,621 --> 00:19:44,621
we're in contact with today.
Yeah.

558
00:19:44,621 --> 00:19:44,810
Yeah.
So she's laying on.

559
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,060
It's a good point.
Like we haven't really looked yet.

560
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,560
So the idea that,
you know,

561
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:51,020
the stars are silent or anything,
it's like man,

562
00:19:51,021 --> 00:19:56,021
come on.
We haven't even begun to do a 

563
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:56,021
comprehensive.

564
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:56,300
Said he makes me sad.
Why?

565
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,100
Because I feel like they're wasting 
their time.

566
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,390
And uh,
there's a,

567
00:19:59,391 --> 00:20:04,391
there was a documentary I saw wants 
about some biologist who was convinced 

568
00:20:04,391 --> 00:20:09,101
that the giant sloths was still alive 
and that there was examples of them in 

569
00:20:09,101 --> 00:20:13,511
South America and this poor bastard had 
spent more than a decade looking for 

570
00:20:14,061 --> 00:20:18,140
this giant sloths in South America.
And there was,

571
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:23,370
there was this moment where he was 
chasing down this suppose the dung pile 

572
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:29,501
and they were looking for and someone 
was there and he had this look in his 

573
00:20:29,501 --> 00:20:30,270
eyes were like,
he was like,

574
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:35,290
Holy Shit,
what if I wasted my fucking life in my 

575
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,591
academic career,
chasing down something that's not even 

576
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:42,131
real.
That's kind of how I've always felt 

577
00:20:42,131 --> 00:20:42,131
about setting.

578
00:20:42,131 --> 00:20:42,131
Yeah.
But that's not the way the people.

579
00:20:42,131 --> 00:20:42,290
I mean,
everybody was involved in it.

580
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,250
Um,
you know,

581
00:20:43,251 --> 00:20:44,300
I don't do steady,
you know,

582
00:20:44,301 --> 00:20:45,050
I mean,
you know,

583
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,490
I respect that people are doing it.
It's not.

584
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,500
Yeah.
But you know,

585
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,400
most of them are like,
look,

586
00:20:48,401 --> 00:20:51,180
this is just a multigenerational thing,
you know?

587
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,300
And if,
even if I don't find it,

588
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:53,340
I'm laying the foundation.
It's like,

589
00:20:53,341 --> 00:20:54,250
you know,
cathedrals,

590
00:20:54,251 --> 00:20:59,251
right?
It took like how many generations does 

591
00:20:59,251 --> 00:20:59,251
it take to build a cathedral in Medieval
Europe?

592
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:02,731
Right?
So the first guy who laid the stone was 

593
00:21:02,731 --> 00:21:02,731
like,
I'm not going to see this,

594
00:21:02,731 --> 00:21:02,731
you know,
maybe my great grandkids.

595
00:21:02,731 --> 00:21:03,940
So most of them were like,
you know,

596
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,630
they're,
you know,

597
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,240
they know that this is gonna,
you know,

598
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,320
this is a,
this is a huge.

599
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,700
It's like the most important question in
humanity,

600
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:10,720
right?
Are we alone?

601
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:12,040
And they're willing to accept that.

602
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,360
Like,
you know,

603
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:17,410
you're going to do it scientifically,
you're going to have to do it brick by 

604
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:17,410
brick,
you know,

605
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,920
and so you just have to accept that and,
you know,

606
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,130
go on.
So,

607
00:21:20,131 --> 00:21:20,980
uh,
but like I said,

608
00:21:20,981 --> 00:21:21,990
I think we've,
you know,

609
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,970
this is a new era now.
So the idea of like looking for signals,

610
00:21:24,971 --> 00:21:26,710
which assumes that somebody is putting 
out signals,

611
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:27,280
right?
That's,

612
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:32,550
that's a huge assumption right there.
But now that we know that there's all 

613
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,160
these planets and we're staring at all 
these planets,

614
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:38,460
it's kind of,
we need to be thinking differently 

615
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:38,460
about,
you know,

616
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,650
we need to be prepared for what happens 
when we see something we don't 

617
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:40,650
understand.
Well,

618
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,950
it's also,
we don't even use radio anymore.

619
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:42,810
Right?
Right.

620
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,330
Gabriel radio is dying slowly but 
surely.

621
00:21:46,331 --> 00:21:47,980
Yeah.
Local radio is.

622
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,710
I mean it's,
it's kind of a thing of the past,

623
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,160
right?

624
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:56,190
The only thing that's really were 
beaming out a large scale is a military 

625
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:56,190
radar.
No,

626
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,260
that's the main thing.
So there'd be some kind of signal.

627
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:01,720
It wouldn't necessarily have to be radar
or,

628
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:06,721
or radio just have to be something that 
we could detect some form of anomaly 

629
00:22:06,721 --> 00:22:07,730
that seemed to be artificial.
Right?

630
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:12,780
So here's like,
here's some of the suggestions that 

631
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,341
people are talking about.
So Avi Loeb at Harvard talks about the 

632
00:22:14,341 --> 00:22:14,341
idea,
you know,

633
00:22:14,341 --> 00:22:15,370
maybe what you need and you're gonna 
need the sensitivity for this.

634
00:22:15,371 --> 00:22:18,460
You're going to see like rocket engines 
going back and forth between,

635
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,550
you know,
uh,

636
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:22,390
you have a plan that you have to a multi
planet civilization on,

637
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,610
in some and you're going to see little 
flares is rockets,

638
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:26,410
decelerate,
accelerate back and forth.

639
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,420
People have talked about seeing city 
lights,

640
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,800
you know,
the telescopes are getting,

641
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,130
you know,
we're,

642
00:22:31,131 --> 00:22:36,131
we're,
we're building these giant telescopes 

643
00:22:36,131 --> 00:22:38,021
there,
like 30 meters and may be a potential 

644
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:38,021
one day to see city lights.

645
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:39,070
You could see city lights when you're 
going to see the planet come around.

646
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:39,850
Like this is all like,
you know,

647
00:22:39,851 --> 00:22:40,330
we're,
we're not,

648
00:22:40,331 --> 00:22:42,970
we're not there yet,
but people 20 years,

649
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:43,990
30 years,
30 years,

650
00:22:43,991 --> 00:22:44,600
40 years,
you know,

651
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,750
this is a long game and you got to be 
playing the long game.

652
00:22:46,751 --> 00:22:51,751
At some point we're gonna need to build 
stuff in space that's even larger so we 

653
00:22:51,751 --> 00:22:54,721
can collect more light.
And multi issue will also be that if we 

654
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:55,300
do see these city lights,
we're seeing city lights for millions of

655
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:55,750
years ago.
Well,

656
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:56,470
it depends,
like,

657
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,250
you know,
uh,

658
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,600
planets that,
that's a,

659
00:22:58,601 --> 00:22:59,740
an,
a star 10 light years ago,

660
00:22:59,741 --> 00:23:01,120
that's 10 years ago.
So it's not like,

661
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:02,900
you know,
these things could still be around.

662
00:23:02,901 --> 00:23:04,840
Okay,
here's a really interesting idea,

663
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:05,510
like,
um,

664
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:05,980
because,
you know,

665
00:23:05,981 --> 00:23:10,981
one of the things that I'm talking about
my book is like how long does any 

666
00:23:10,981 --> 00:23:10,981
civilization last?

667
00:23:10,981 --> 00:23:10,981
Right?
That's the real question.

668
00:23:10,981 --> 00:23:15,930
All of this stuff is rest super relevant
for us now because the question is what 

669
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:16,600
is the average lifetime of a 
civilization?

670
00:23:16,601 --> 00:23:20,890
So you might be able to see artifacts 
from civilizations that are gone,

671
00:23:20,891 --> 00:23:23,170
like imagine of civilization covered one
of its moons in,

672
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,840
in um,
uh,

673
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:25,960
solar panels,
right?

674
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:31,090
The reflected light is going to show a 
spectral signature of the,

675
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:32,050
uh,
the panels,

676
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:37,380
you know,
so it's like they don't even have to 

677
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:37,660
necessarily be alive now that we still 
might be able to see stuff from there,

678
00:23:37,661 --> 00:23:42,661
you know,
are evidence of like artificial 

679
00:23:42,661 --> 00:23:42,661
structures or something that's not 
natural around them.

680
00:23:42,661 --> 00:23:43,060
So,
you know,

681
00:23:43,061 --> 00:23:43,750
that's the thing,
man.

682
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:45,070
It's like we're really,
we're just,

683
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:49,570
we're about to take this step in step in
astrobiology we're,

684
00:23:49,571 --> 00:23:50,090
we're,
you know,

685
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:53,330
we're already running models.
Have a Xcel biospheres,

686
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:53,650
right?
We're two.

687
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:54,320
We're asking like,
oh,

688
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:59,321
what kind of chemistry can you have if 
you don't like if you have a 

689
00:23:59,321 --> 00:24:01,280
photosynthesis in s are on a planet 
around a star that's smaller than ours,

690
00:24:01,281 --> 00:24:03,840
that starts gonna be mostly red as 
opposed to yellow light.

691
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,720
So the light that's coming off,
it's going to be different.

692
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:07,700
Kenya have photosynthesis in that case 
and people are like,

693
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:08,660
yeah,
you probably could.

694
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:13,661
And what would it look like?
So we're already doing the work to be 

695
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,520
ready for Expo biospheres.
So exos civilizations,

696
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,210
we kind of need to be prepared for that 
too.

697
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,270
Looking for,
you know,

698
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,520
what,
what could be the traces,

699
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:21,860
what might we see from a distance from 
an eco civilization.

700
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,750
They don't have to be signaling us,
you know,

701
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,350
they're just there and we're going to 
catch some aspect of their being around.

702
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:32,550
Even if we did see rocket,
if we did see some sort of a signature 

703
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,450
from rockets going back and forth,
or the w,

704
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:39,700
W,
we would have to assume that this is a 

705
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:39,860
similarly aged civilization to hours.

706
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,770
Whereas if we saw something that was a 
thousand,

707
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,480
100,000
years advanced,

708
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:49,780
we probably wouldn't see that anymore.
We'll probably see some sort of a 

709
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,720
manipulation of time and space,
if that's possible,

710
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,190
if it's possible,
if it's possible.

711
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:52,530
Yeah.
Yeah.

712
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,120
So that's,
I mean,

713
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:54,920
of course that is one of the problems is
that,

714
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:56,150
um,
when you start,

715
00:24:56,151 --> 00:24:57,350
you know,
when you start pushing,

716
00:24:57,351 --> 00:24:58,150
it's just like saying like,
you know,

717
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:58,720
what is the,
what are,

718
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,200
what are we going to be like in a 
million years?

719
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,090
You know,
I mean,

720
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:05,420
it's so long.
So I think you start with what you know.

721
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,600
And the,
the cool thing about the planet part 

722
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:10,600
though is that,
you know,

723
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:10,600
unless they become like energy beings,
you know,

724
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,590
they're gonna have an effect on their 
planet.

725
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:15,410
So looking at their planets to look for,
you know,

726
00:25:15,411 --> 00:25:18,380
for spectral indications.
That's probably even after they die,

727
00:25:18,381 --> 00:25:20,030
there might even be things,
so that's,

728
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:20,620
I think a,
you know,

729
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,440
a good way to go.

730
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:22,880
Yeah.
I'm,

731
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,060
you know,
I'm so curious as to what we're going to

732
00:25:26,061 --> 00:25:28,490
be able to do in a thousand years,
10,000

733
00:25:28,491 --> 00:25:30,000
years and 100,000
years.

734
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:35,350
Civilization does Dale around and we 
figured out how to not melt the earth or

735
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:39,230
boil the oceans or whatever.
Whatever the ground we're doing.

736
00:25:39,231 --> 00:25:39,710
Yeah.
Right.

737
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,990
But there's,
you know,

738
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,790
a bunch of science fiction films that do
speculated what,

739
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:46,310
what's going to be possible in the 
future.

740
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:49,040
And one of them was a,
what was that recent one with?

741
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,020
What's his name?
All right.

742
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:52,490
All right.
What's his name?

743
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,700
The fuck's his name?
Mechanic.

744
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,310
I'm the one where they go through the 
wormholes.

745
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,850
Right.
How much do those movies piss you off or

746
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:01,810
they don't?
I don't know.

747
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,970
I,
I do not mean but they get so of science

748
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:05,870
fiction so,
you know,

749
00:26:05,871 --> 00:26:09,950
I mean I do not need my science fiction 
to be correct to be correct.

750
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,630
I mean if they want to make,
you know.

751
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,150
So I love the expanse.
The is my favorite show ever.

752
00:26:14,151 --> 00:26:15,860
I will talk about it.
What is the expanse,

753
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,250
the expanse I don't even know.
Thank you.

754
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,640
Help me.
Um,

755
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,500
so the expanse,
it's a series of books,

756
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:26,530
first of all that I think are the best 
science fiction books in the last 15 

757
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:29,471
years.
And then they made him into it and made 

758
00:26:29,471 --> 00:26:29,471
it into a show,
uh,

759
00:26:29,471 --> 00:26:30,110
on Saifai and then had three years of 
it.

760
00:26:30,111 --> 00:26:31,010
And you know,
at first people were like,

761
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,320
oh,
this is kind of hard to follow because,

762
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:33,650
you know,
it's a lot of stories coming together.

763
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,110
And then,
um,

764
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,520
you know,
this year it got 100 percent,

765
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,440
uh,
uh,

766
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,920
ratings or what is it?
Rotten tomatoes,

767
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:46,950
rotten tomatoes.
A hundred percent or 95 percent if 

768
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:46,950
people love Scifi,
cancelled it,

769
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,180
you know.
And so then Jeff Bezos just.

770
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:48,590
Yeah,
Jeff,

771
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,720
he just picked it up because people love
this show.

772
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:55,080
Fuck yeah,
I'll tell you why this show is amazing,

773
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,950
right?
So,

774
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
um,
it takes place about 200 years from now 

775
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,000
and we are truly a multi planet species.
Like Mars now has,

776
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,630
you know,
billion people on it and it's become its

777
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:04,710
own political power,
right?

778
00:27:04,711 --> 00:27:08,250
If it's separated from the earth.
And then the asteroid belt has also,

779
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:13,251
people are colonizing and you know,
living on the asteroid belt to mind 

780
00:27:13,251 --> 00:27:14,280
resources,
but the belters as they call them,

781
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:19,550
are like,
they're like second class citizens who 

782
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:19,550
are basically like super poor and 
they're,

783
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:23,290
you know,
they've got the boot on their next by 

784
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,030
either earth or Mars.
And so there's this whole interplanetary

785
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,000
kind of political shit going on,
which is just great,

786
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:27,990
you know.
Um,

787
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,020
and then there's,
you enter into this,

788
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,720
they discover like the,
what they call the protein molecule,

789
00:27:33,721 --> 00:27:34,020
like,
you know,

790
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:39,050
it was,
this is basically this alien molecule 

791
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,190
that was really a device that some 
aliens through our way,

792
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,150
billions of years ago that was,
you know,

793
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,600
how much am I supposed to give away,
you know,

794
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,010
I don't want it.

795
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,320
So.
No,

796
00:27:44,321 --> 00:27:46,020
not too much.
No one's going to remember.

797
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,530
Right.
Good,

798
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,330
good.
Uh,

799
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,530
so that complicated so that,
you know,

800
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,460
that becomes kind of a weapon in this,
this political intrigue.

801
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:58,610
So it's just a great story to kind of,
people call it like the game of thrones 

802
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,431
and space,
but I'll tell you what I love about it 

803
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:01,431
is that this is what it's gonna look 
like,

804
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:04,350
like they get the science on this show.
So write as much as you can,

805
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,040
right?
So,

806
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:07,710
you know,
in space if your rocket motors are on,

807
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,380
there's gravity because you know,
the rocket motors push up towards you.

808
00:28:10,381 --> 00:28:11,280
And so yeah,
you got grabbed,

809
00:28:11,281 --> 00:28:13,290
you can walk around when you turn the 
rocket motors off,

810
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:16,110
you float around,
right on spinning things,

811
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:16,500
you know,
anything.

812
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:16,860
So,
you know,

813
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:17,500
in the,
in,

814
00:28:17,501 --> 00:28:18,390
in this universe,
you know,

815
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:21,790
in this the fictional universe,
they've taken the big asteroids and they

816
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:23,280
followed them out and spun them up.

817
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,530
So people live on the inside,
you know.

818
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,500
And um,
so at one point like the,

819
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:29,250
that one of the characters that the 
private eye,

820
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:32,670
they got this great sort of film noir 
thing going on and he pours a drink,

821
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,970
some whiskey and the whiskey does this,
spirals into this.

822
00:28:35,971 --> 00:28:38,880
So they got that,
the Coriolis I peed my pants.

823
00:28:38,881 --> 00:28:39,600
I was like,
oh my God,

824
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:41,160
they got the coriolis effect.
Right.

825
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:46,460
So it's like,
this is really what it's gonna look 

826
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:46,460
like,
you know what I mean?

827
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,040
This is if you want to imagine 200 years
from now,

828
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:52,041
which I think is completely feasible,
that we have millions of people living 

829
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:54,150
in space making advances socially.
Uh,

830
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,030
no,
no,

831
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,650
no.
People are assholes to each other.

832
00:28:58,651 --> 00:29:00,150
And that's what makes it.
Yeah.

833
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,460
It's only 200 years.
That's a lot to ask for.

834
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:07,790
Well,
think about how different we are from 

835
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:07,790
people that live 50 years ago.

836
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:07,790
I mean,
I don't want that different.

837
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,550
I think we're quite a bit different.
In what way?

838
00:29:08,551 --> 00:29:09,160
What do you think?
Like,

839
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:14,630
well,
we have this ability to communicate now 

840
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:17,031
that we never did before where everybody
has an ability to say their piece about 

841
00:29:17,031 --> 00:29:18,360
how they feel about how things are 
going.

842
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:18,810
Yeah.
No,

843
00:29:18,811 --> 00:29:19,650
that's interesting.
Right?

844
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:21,630
And that has changed a lot of things a 
lot of ways,

845
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,570
but I mean it has,
it changed who we are.

846
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,800
I mean,
I think evolution,

847
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,430
I think it's chipping away.
Well that would be good if it,

848
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,150
you know,
because one of the things,

849
00:29:30,151 --> 00:29:35,151
my thing,
so what's interesting about this 

850
00:29:35,151 --> 00:29:35,151
fictional world too is that like 
climate,

851
00:29:35,151 --> 00:29:38,061
you know,
the earth is dealing with client earth 

852
00:29:38,061 --> 00:29:38,061
has like 30 billion people on it and you
know,

853
00:29:38,061 --> 00:29:39,450
New York is halfway under water and so 
that's part of the story too,

854
00:29:39,451 --> 00:29:40,020
is that,
you know,

855
00:29:40,021 --> 00:29:45,021
so we're trying to navigate our way 
through now becoming a multi planet 

856
00:29:45,021 --> 00:29:45,021
species.

857
00:29:45,021 --> 00:29:45,310
Um,
so,

858
00:29:45,311 --> 00:29:50,311
you know,
that is a version of at least 200 years 

859
00:29:50,311 --> 00:29:51,310
where you can really extrapolate the 
technologies and ask yourself.

860
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,120
Because that's real.
I mean,

861
00:29:52,121 --> 00:29:54,220
I think that's really gonna happen.
If we make it through climate change,

862
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:56,710
that's the,
that's the prize at the end of the,

863
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,750
you know,
uh,

864
00:29:57,751 --> 00:29:58,810
of the,
of the story.

865
00:29:58,811 --> 00:30:00,430
If we make it through climate change,
you know,

866
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:02,890
what the stuff that Elon Musk and Jeff 
Bezos are doing,

867
00:30:02,891 --> 00:30:04,230
man,
that's real like this.

868
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,760
This is what your number one concern is.
Climate Change.

869
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,530
Michael.
I'm a single voter.

870
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:13,550
Yeah.
Climate change because it's like it is 

871
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:13,550
an existential dilemma,
you know,

872
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,680
and because of all the writing I did for
NPR and New York Times,

873
00:30:14,681 --> 00:30:19,681
I have dealt with a lot of climate 
change denialist men and it drives me 

874
00:30:19,681 --> 00:30:19,681
what is their big,
what's the big.

875
00:30:19,681 --> 00:30:22,000
Because I,
I recently had a discussion with someone

876
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:25,150
on the podcast that didn't believe in 
climate change and it was,

877
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:30,210
it was a weird thing is because I kept 
pulling up all the different scientific 

878
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,380
consensus studies,
all the different studies that show that

879
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,820
we were having an impact.

880
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,650
It's an undeniable impact,
undeniable.

881
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,530
Thirty years of science.
I know.

882
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,420
I saw that and she was like,
you know,

883
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,460
that's what you say.
I don't think that she's really thinking

884
00:30:42,461 --> 00:30:47,461
about the and the hurricane it was.
I don't think she really thinks about 

885
00:30:47,461 --> 00:30:50,941
it.
I think she just has this stance that 

886
00:30:50,941 --> 00:30:51,040
she believes that that group that she's 
a part of,

887
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:56,070
that's what a subscribes to.
So there's an ideological aspect of it 

888
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:00,570
where you kind of.
You have a predetermined pattern that 

889
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:00,570
you're supposed to follow when you're on
one side,

890
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:05,560
you have to be pro life.
You have to be pro second amendment 

891
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,010
stuff stuff.
Yeah.

892
00:31:06,011 --> 00:31:11,011
And that's,
I think it's a giant problem with our 

893
00:31:11,011 --> 00:31:13,321
culture.
There are two groups of people that you 

894
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:13,540
can't like to truly be an independent 
thinker.

895
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:18,541
You're like one of these Weirdos.
It's often the fringe to be independent 

896
00:31:18,541 --> 00:31:18,541
of either party.

897
00:31:18,541 --> 00:31:19,120
Right?
Right.

898
00:31:19,121 --> 00:31:22,210
And the thing about science is the whole
point of science is to be independent,

899
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,050
is to be,
and to have,

900
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,310
you know,
what science is,

901
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,340
science is a way of having public 
knowledge.

902
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,960
You know what I mean?
Like everybody has their opinions,

903
00:31:28,961 --> 00:31:33,961
whatever.
But science is about the stuff we can 

904
00:31:33,961 --> 00:31:33,961
all be like,
oh yeah,

905
00:31:33,961 --> 00:31:33,961
for sure.
You know,

906
00:31:33,961 --> 00:31:37,631
it's this whole process that we've 
evolved over 400 years and with climate 

907
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:38,920
denial man,
sometimes you know,

908
00:31:38,921 --> 00:31:39,630
it's just.
Yeah,

909
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,580
you want to be like,
what?

910
00:31:40,581 --> 00:31:42,370
What are you saying man?
Like what are,

911
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:47,390
you know,
read a book because they'll say stuff 

912
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:47,390
like,
here's my favorite one.

913
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:47,390
Oh,
climate's always changing climate change

914
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,490
in man,
which is true.

915
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:54,270
So if somebody comes to me,
because you know what I want most for 

916
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,551
people I don't like,
I consider myself an evangelist of 

917
00:31:56,551 --> 00:31:56,551
science.
I love science.

918
00:31:56,551 --> 00:31:56,890
And so if people come to me they say,
hey man,

919
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,300
the climate always changing.
I'm like,

920
00:31:58,301 --> 00:31:59,200
oh,
great question.

921
00:31:59,201 --> 00:32:00,850
You know,
we actually know the answer to that yet.

922
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:03,940
It's changing but it's changing.
What's the timescale,

923
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,160
you know.
So it changes often on million year time

924
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:09,940
scales,
but like from the last 10,000

925
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:11,800
years since the last ice age,
which was 10,000

926
00:32:11,801 --> 00:32:12,820
years ago,
which is amazing.

927
00:32:12,821 --> 00:32:14,920
Like there used to be a mile of ice 
above our heads,

928
00:32:14,921 --> 00:32:16,060
you know,
text 10,000

929
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:18,430
years ago,
climate has been remarkably stable.

930
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,600
Yeah.
Has been little blips in it,

931
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,370
but no major changes.
Right?

932
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:21,970
So,
like,

933
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,340
and I can show them the graph of this 
and everything.

934
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,160
So if you're,
if you know,

935
00:32:25,161 --> 00:32:26,590
if they're interested,
you know,

936
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:31,591
I mean if they're.
So if they're asking the question 

937
00:32:31,591 --> 00:32:31,591
because they want to know I'm,
I'm all,

938
00:32:31,591 --> 00:32:31,591
I'm down to talk until the cows come 
home.

939
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,700
But that's not what a typical deniers 
are.

940
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,280
Deniers climate change.
Well done.

941
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,610
But they're not interested in the 
answer,

942
00:32:36,611 --> 00:32:41,611
but it isn't it.
It's not only the not interested in the 

943
00:32:41,611 --> 00:32:41,611
answer,
they're just

944
00:32:41,611 --> 00:32:45,160
trying to win.
It's not a real conversation because 

945
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,630
it's a really complex thing.
If you dig an ice core and you tap down 

946
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:52,110
to 50,000,
$80,000

947
00:32:52,111 --> 00:32:53,090
100,000
years,

948
00:32:53,091 --> 00:32:58,091
you see all these bizarre shifts of the 
climate that could be indicative of 

949
00:32:58,091 --> 00:33:01,490
super volcanoes and asteroidal impacts 
and solar flares.

950
00:33:01,491 --> 00:33:04,230
A Lotta Shit happens over the course of 
a million years.

951
00:33:04,231 --> 00:33:06,380
Right?
But to

952
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,280
hang all your

953
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:14,680
ideas on the party's ideology and to 
deny all this really interesting stuff 

954
00:33:16,971 --> 00:33:17,390
and,
and,

955
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,220
and all these

956
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,630
variables.
That's what,

957
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:21,040
that's what pisses me off.
It's like,

958
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,150
you know what I try and tell people,
it's like,

959
00:33:22,151 --> 00:33:24,160
look,
climate science is like awesome.

960
00:33:24,161 --> 00:33:29,161
Like it's science.
It's got these amazing stories to tell 

961
00:33:29,161 --> 00:33:29,161
about,
you know?

962
00:33:29,161 --> 00:33:30,460
Yeah.
The earth earth over the past four point

963
00:33:30,461 --> 00:33:35,461
5 billion years,
the earth has gone through the most 

964
00:33:35,461 --> 00:33:36,160
profound changes and we've learned about
aren't you interested in that?

965
00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:41,161
But no.
They basically have this thing where 

966
00:33:41,161 --> 00:33:41,161
like,
you know,

967
00:33:41,161 --> 00:33:41,161
I'm,
I'm part of this group.

968
00:33:41,161 --> 00:33:42,640
And therefore have to have this opinion 
and I'm like,

969
00:33:42,641 --> 00:33:43,660
dude,
it's science.

970
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,240
Science doesn't care who you voted for.
You know what I mean?

971
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:46,810
Like the,
the,

972
00:33:46,811 --> 00:33:51,811
a rated of properties of a co two 
molecule doesn't care whether you're 

973
00:33:51,811 --> 00:33:54,931
wearing a blue tie or a red tie and the 
fact that people can't make that 

974
00:33:54,931 --> 00:33:54,931
distinction.
And here's the real problem.

975
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,280
Once you go down this slippery road of 
denying,

976
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,090
saying like,
okay,

977
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,790
that kind of science I hate man,
they're all a hoax.

978
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,660
Well,
you know,

979
00:34:01,661 --> 00:34:06,661
America's prosperity and our safety has 
been built on science over the last 200 

980
00:34:06,661 --> 00:34:06,770
years.
You know,

981
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:11,820
you start to erode the whole thing.
You can't just like call one group of 

982
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:11,950
Geoscientists Hucksters,
you know?

983
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,590
And so they're only doing for learning 
and not have it slowly.

984
00:34:14,591 --> 00:34:16,720
In fact,
everything else to the point where like,

985
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:21,721
you know,
China will be happy to eat our lunch 

986
00:34:21,721 --> 00:34:21,721
when it comes scientifically.
Chinese pumping,

987
00:34:21,721 --> 00:34:22,720
huge amounts of money into science.
You're not doing this.

988
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:23,590
So like,
you know,

989
00:34:23,591 --> 00:34:24,550
we're,
we're limiting.

990
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,140
And here's the other thing that really 
bums me out.

991
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:29,650
Science is not a,
it's not a lunch buffet.

992
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:30,970
You know what I mean?
You can't be like,

993
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,500
Oh man,
can I have some of those antibiotics?

994
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:34,330
I Love Antibiotics and Oh yeah,
the cell phone's great.

995
00:34:34,331 --> 00:34:35,920
I'll use that.
I really want to fly in a plane,

996
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,640
but climate change is bullshit.
You know?

997
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:39,640
I mean like,
you know,

998
00:34:39,641 --> 00:34:42,170
either you accept that you live in a 
scientific society.

999
00:34:42,171 --> 00:34:44,580
It doesn't mean like your slave actually
adhere to anything.

1000
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:49,630
You know,
it comes out in the journal it 

1001
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:49,630
yesterday,
but you know,

1002
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,991
either you adhere to the idea that this 
method has produced miracles for us or 

1003
00:34:51,991 --> 00:34:53,850
you don't give me the cell phone back.
Well,

1004
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:54,920
the terrific

1005
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,920
method is what has established the 
actual real facts of how things interact

1006
00:35:01,311 --> 00:35:06,311
with each other.
That it's allowed us to create 

1007
00:35:06,311 --> 00:35:06,311
technology and I think they,
they,

1008
00:35:06,311 --> 00:35:09,560
they split that distinction.
They focus on the technology and 

1009
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,810
commerce,
which is more important than their eyes.

1010
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:12,930
Then the,
the,

1011
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:17,950
the,
the consequences of the environment or 

1012
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:18,140
what's going to happen to the 
environment.

1013
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,470
Yeah.
There's the big hope is that we're going

1014
00:35:20,471 --> 00:35:22,700
to figure it out and I'm hopeful of that
too,

1015
00:35:22,701 --> 00:35:27,701
is that we're going to figure out some 
way to extract carbon from the 

1016
00:35:27,701 --> 00:35:29,060
atmosphere with devices or some 
enormous,

1017
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:34,150
like there was,
I don't know if it was a working 

1018
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,581
prototype or is just a concept,
but there was an enormous building that 

1019
00:35:36,581 --> 00:35:38,070
was really an air filter.
The other starting to look

1020
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:43,070
at carbon capture again with places like
Hong Kong and places where they have 

1021
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:47,180
terrible Beijing and they have terrible,
terrible pollution and more importantly 

1022
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:51,111
particulates in the atmosphere.
So it's not just a a like a carbon 

1023
00:35:51,111 --> 00:35:55,581
thing.
It's like they have shit in there air 

1024
00:35:55,581 --> 00:35:55,581
that they're breathing in your lungs.
Awful.

1025
00:35:55,581 --> 00:35:56,120
It's,
you know,

1026
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,800
I went to Mexico City a couple years 
back.

1027
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:03,860
I've been there twice,
but I went there for a UFC and when we 

1028
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,410
were flying in,
I took photos and I put them on my 

1029
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:06,410
instagram.
So you find those.

1030
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,570
They're fucking shocking.
Unbelievable.

1031
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:13,620
Right?
What kind of a creepy animal is the 

1032
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,101
human?
The human is capable of burning smoke 

1033
00:36:16,101 --> 00:36:20,670
into the very air that we need to take 
into the lungs to keep our body a lot.

1034
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,190
Oh,
you see it so bad.

1035
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,170
People have never been to Mexico City.
Like it's a stunner,

1036
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,510
dude.
My fucking head was killing me after two

1037
00:36:27,511 --> 00:36:28,260
days there.
Yeah,

1038
00:36:28,261 --> 00:36:30,330
well that's what like with the Beijing,
when they had the Olympics,

1039
00:36:30,331 --> 00:36:31,040
right,
they had to like,

1040
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:36,060
you know,
they had to stop all industrial 

1041
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,060
activity,
but like the month,

1042
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,140
right?
La used to look like this right before 

1043
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:39,140
the clean air act,
la would have,

1044
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,920
that's what I wrote.
I wrote Mexico's La on steroids.

1045
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:44,190
Mexico City's early on steroids.
It's just so dark,

1046
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:44,790
you know,
the,

1047
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:46,230
uh,
this whole question of what we'll do,

1048
00:36:46,231 --> 00:36:47,820
like this brings us back to the aliens,
right?

1049
00:36:47,821 --> 00:36:49,950
What's my,
my point is,

1050
00:36:49,951 --> 00:36:50,670
is that,
you know,

1051
00:36:50,671 --> 00:36:52,440
we're not the first time this has 
happened.

1052
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,060
It pretty much if you build the 
civilization,

1053
00:36:55,061 --> 00:37:00,061
anybody who builds the civilization like
we've done is going to trigger climate 

1054
00:37:00,061 --> 00:37:00,061
change.
Right?

1055
00:37:00,061 --> 00:37:00,910
It's like it's kind of unavoidable.
Right?

1056
00:37:00,911 --> 00:37:02,560
So that's,
it goes back to the denier thing.

1057
00:37:02,561 --> 00:37:04,450
And one of the things I'm trying to do 
is flip the script,

1058
00:37:04,451 --> 00:37:05,860
right,
because you talked to climate denialists

1059
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,110
and it's the same fricking set of things
that like,

1060
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:08,910
you know,
man Dude,

1061
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,730
we've been here before.
We,

1062
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,800
the questions will be answered,
but I'm trying to like flip it to show 

1063
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,200
that like the whole question of did we 
change the climate?

1064
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:17,940
That's why everybody focused on did we,
did we not,

1065
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,960
you know,
and you know from when you take the 

1066
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:22,960
10,000
light your view,

1067
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,850
then what you realize is like,
what did you expect?

1068
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:29,090
Like we built a world girdling 
civilization that uses a quarter almost 

1069
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,030
of all the energy the biosphere uses,
right?

1070
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,020
So you know,
every,

1071
00:37:31,021 --> 00:37:32,940
you know,
every day the biosphere has like,

1072
00:37:32,941 --> 00:37:37,941
you know,
200 terawatts of energy that it's 

1073
00:37:37,941 --> 00:37:38,670
producing and sugars we use about a 
quarter of that.

1074
00:37:38,671 --> 00:37:41,400
Like how did you expect there wasn't 
going to be an impact,

1075
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:46,430
right?
So this changes the whole way we look 

1076
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:46,430
at.
We don't need to argue about like,

1077
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:46,680
did we or didn't we?
Of course we did.

1078
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,810
This is what happens when you reach this
level.

1079
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,920
And the other thing that,
you know,

1080
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:51,660
in the book that I'm trying to argue to 
also,

1081
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:57,230
and it pushes back against the deniers,
is like what climate deniers are human 

1082
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:57,230
haters,
you know,

1083
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:57,270
they're all like,
you know,

1084
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:02,660
we did this amazing thing.
We changed the atmosphere of an entire 

1085
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:02,660
planet,
right?

1086
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,310
Climate change shows on one level how 
fricking awesome we are.

1087
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,050
You know,
how far we've gotten and this,

1088
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,040
if you look at the,
you know,

1089
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:09,800
from the perspective of,
you know,

1090
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,450
species doing this again and again 
across the universe,

1091
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,760
this shows that we've reached a level,
right?

1092
00:38:14,761 --> 00:38:15,870
We have,
we've leveled up,

1093
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,340
right?
You don't play a lot of video games,

1094
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:22,341
right?
And so that whole thing when you level 

1095
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:22,341
up and you know,
you get the,

1096
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:22,341
the sniper rifle,
we've leveled up.

1097
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,640
And so now the question is,
are we smart enough,

1098
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:28,820
you know,
to see what we've done and make the 

1099
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:28,820
right choices because that's what the 
universe is going to be.

1100
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:33,471
There's going to be species that trigger
climate change is gonna happen all the 

1101
00:38:33,471 --> 00:38:33,471
time.
And some are going to be like,

1102
00:38:33,471 --> 00:38:34,200
Oh man,
we need to do something right.

1103
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:36,190
And they'll make the actions,
they'll be able to work it out,

1104
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:37,630
get it together,
and other ones,

1105
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:42,710
you know,
which is going to end up in the cosmic 

1106
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:42,710
waste pile.

1107
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:42,710
So we're like cosmic teenagers and just 
like when you're a teenager and you're,

1108
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:43,270
you know,
uh,

1109
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,470
you get,
you start to drive,

1110
00:38:44,471 --> 00:38:45,940
right?
Either you figure it out,

1111
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:50,941
you know,
either you're drinking and you're 

1112
00:38:50,941 --> 00:38:52,201
partying and drive the car off a cliff 
or you figure out how to handle your 

1113
00:38:52,201 --> 00:38:52,201
responsibility.
And that's us now,

1114
00:38:52,201 --> 00:38:52,990
you know.
Yeah,

1115
00:38:52,991 --> 00:38:54,040
no,
I agree with you.

1116
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:54,460
And,
uh,

1117
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,350
I,
I feel like there's a fundamental,

1118
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:00,080
fundamental problem with the way people 
approach ideas and uh,

1119
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,860
I think it goes back to what we're 
talking about earlier about right versus

1120
00:39:02,861 --> 00:39:05,980
left or you know,
Republican versus Democrat,

1121
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:09,010
they're not thinking of the consequences
of arguing for,

1122
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,310
against the possibility that climate 
change is a human caused thing.

1123
00:39:12,311 --> 00:39:13,540
They're not thinking of the 
consequences.

1124
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:14,860
They just want to win.
Right,

1125
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,220
right.
And what their side to be,

1126
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:17,140
right want their site to be.

1127
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:17,620
Right.
And that,

1128
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:18,110
you know,
what,

1129
00:39:18,111 --> 00:39:23,111
what bums me out is they don't 
understand the consequences of that for 

1130
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,760
the both the American enterprise and the
human enterprise,

1131
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,510
right?
I mean,

1132
00:39:25,511 --> 00:39:26,710
because,
you know,

1133
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:27,820
uh,
if you,

1134
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:31,570
if you keep calling one branch of 
science a hoax,

1135
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,430
then what's to say the other branches,
like what,

1136
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:33,910
you know,
then you just,

1137
00:39:33,911 --> 00:39:38,911
you're down,
you're rolling down this slippery slope 

1138
00:39:38,911 --> 00:39:38,911
where like the other countries you don't
like.

1139
00:39:38,911 --> 00:39:39,910
So most of the,
of the,

1140
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:44,911
um,
Nobel prizes Americans have one where 

1141
00:39:44,911 --> 00:39:47,611
people from other countries,
they came here to do their science 

1142
00:39:47,611 --> 00:39:47,611
because we had the best scientific 
enterprise.

1143
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,870
The next generation will just go 
somewhere else.

1144
00:39:49,871 --> 00:39:51,100
They'll go to China,
you know.

1145
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:52,010
So,
um,

1146
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,980
there's that part of it.
And the other part it's like,

1147
00:39:53,981 --> 00:39:55,270
dude,
it's just science.

1148
00:39:55,271 --> 00:39:58,900
It doesn't care about your political 
views and you know,

1149
00:39:58,901 --> 00:40:03,901
it's not fair to use the cell phone and 
take the antibiotics and then turn 

1150
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,230
around and like,
and then suddenly treat this thing as if

1151
00:40:05,231 --> 00:40:07,780
it was another thing in your bucket of 
ideologies.

1152
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:12,550
I think also people think if you somehow
or another compromise industry's ability

1153
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,800
to work,
that you're going to kill jobs and 

1154
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,520
you're gonna damage the economy and 
that's more important.

1155
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,590
Yeah.
But I think it's the exact opposite.

1156
00:40:20,591 --> 00:40:21,730
Right?
And if people really saw,

1157
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:22,360
right,
I mean,

1158
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,590
um,
you know,

1159
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:24,910
again,
just like I'm saying,

1160
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,550
climate change shows how powerful people
become.

1161
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:29,920
It also shows how powerful are our 
enterprise.

1162
00:40:29,921 --> 00:40:31,630
Right?
We did this by,

1163
00:40:31,631 --> 00:40:36,631
you know,
building businesses by building 

1164
00:40:36,631 --> 00:40:38,731
enterprise bi and we built this world 
girdling machine of civilization and it,

1165
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,830
you know,
the planet actually noticed.

1166
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,580
Why do you like that term world girdling
because that's,

1167
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:48,980
it gives me the hurdle of wrapping 
around think it's because it's from like

1168
00:40:48,981 --> 00:40:52,630
a Shakespeare,
like from a Caesar or something.

1169
00:40:52,631 --> 00:40:54,640
I always thought it wasn't good,
but it's the idea that like,

1170
00:40:54,641 --> 00:40:56,440
you know,
the foundation trilogy,

1171
00:40:56,441 --> 00:40:57,460
the Isaac Yasmin Off,
you know,

1172
00:40:57,461 --> 00:41:02,461
classic science fiction thing,
that there's the city of the planet of 

1173
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:02,461
trend toward which is the center of the,
uh,

1174
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:03,700
the empire,
the Galactic Empire.

1175
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:04,530
And it's,
you know,

1176
00:41:04,531 --> 00:41:07,030
it's basically the whole planet has been
covered in city.

1177
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,350
You know,
like the other planet,

1178
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:11,620
you got to go down to like 500 levels 
before you get to the surface.

1179
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,790
So that idea,
you know,

1180
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,410
what I like about it is the idea that 
like,

1181
00:41:14,411 --> 00:41:15,580
you know,
we've done something,

1182
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:18,910
we're kind of covered the planet in our,
our effect,

1183
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,070
you know,
covered the planet in our enterprise.

1184
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,730
So this issue of business is that like,
um,

1185
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,960
there's a place I can stand in 
Rochester,

1186
00:41:25,961 --> 00:41:28,150
I did this for MPR and there's the Erie 
Canal.

1187
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:29,680
I can stand right on the edge of the 
Erie Canal.

1188
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,370
Then there's a train tracks,
you know,

1189
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:33,830
the tracks was laid,
the tracks laid back and you know,

1190
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,260
the original line back in the 18,
whatever seventies.

1191
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:41,500
Then there's a highway and then there's 
the airport right over there for 

1192
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:41,540
different infrastructures,
you know,

1193
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:46,750
which he took huge amounts of money to 
build what of which we don't even use 

1194
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:46,750
anymore.

1195
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:51,490
Right?
So the idea of building on an 

1196
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:52,640
infrastructure that will,
that will not be carbon polluting,

1197
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:54,120
will not trigger climate change.
Like did,

1198
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:59,170
this is what we do.
So the idea that there's going to be 

1199
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,390
more jobs that come out of this than it 
could ever come out of fossil fuels,

1200
00:42:00,391 --> 00:42:05,391
you know,
it's not a big deal for human beings 

1201
00:42:05,391 --> 00:42:08,681
because that's what we do to switch 
infrastructures and there will be a lot 

1202
00:42:08,681 --> 00:42:09,290
of wealth generated by,
you know,

1203
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,550
just like there was,
you know,

1204
00:42:10,551 --> 00:42:12,230
when we switched to the trains,
you know,

1205
00:42:12,231 --> 00:42:16,070
where's the argument coming that we.
Because there are people that just adopt

1206
00:42:16,071 --> 00:42:21,071
the party line,
the party line that human climate's 

1207
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:21,680
always changed and human beings barely 
affected.

1208
00:42:21,681 --> 00:42:22,970
And it's not something to concentrate 
on.

1209
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:24,830
Where's that coming from?
Again,

1210
00:42:24,831 --> 00:42:25,740
I think it's the,
you know,

1211
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,330
the gradual political polo polarization 
of everything,

1212
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,260
you know,
because you look at,

1213
00:42:30,261 --> 00:42:31,100
in the,
um,

1214
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:36,820
we're now at the,
what is it 30 year anniversary of Jim 

1215
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:41,170
Hansen,
who was the famous climate scientist 

1216
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:41,170
giving his testimony in front of 
Congress in 1988 a hot,

1217
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:41,170
sweltering summer day.

1218
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:42,740
We said climate change is already 
happening,

1219
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,500
you know,
and that made news everywhere.

1220
00:42:44,501 --> 00:42:48,020
And that was the first public awakening 
that this was happening.

1221
00:42:48,021 --> 00:42:49,700
And if you look at the first Bush 
administration,

1222
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:50,300
they were like,
oh yeah,

1223
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:51,560
we're ready to do something about this 
year.

1224
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,490
We can do it,
you know?

1225
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,280
Um,
and then it just gradually over time,

1226
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,440
as the whole political polarization 
thing happened,

1227
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:58,660
you can actually see the,
uh,

1228
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:01,130
the very purposeful denial,
right?

1229
00:43:01,131 --> 00:43:03,980
They took a page out of the cigarette 
companies for years,

1230
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:04,780
right?
Cigarettes were like,

1231
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:06,080
cigarette companies are like,
no,

1232
00:43:06,081 --> 00:43:08,510
it's not a problem.
So they were purposefully,

1233
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:10,340
the other people had money invested.
Right.

1234
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:13,190
You know,
this is a documentary that,

1235
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:18,210
that goes into that.
What is the name of that merchants of 

1236
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:18,680
doubt,
merchants of doubt.

1237
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,790
It's a great book,
man.

1238
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:22,540
That's a really good book.
And the documentary is really good.

1239
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,360
It was purposeful.
You know,

1240
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,600
it's,
that's also confusing.

1241
00:43:26,601 --> 00:43:28,070
It's like,
why are they doing that?

1242
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:33,100
Like who's paying them to do that?
Obviously the cigarette companies 

1243
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,681
wouldn't be paying the same people to 
put doubt into the idea that cigarettes 

1244
00:43:36,501 --> 00:43:38,120
are addictive or cigarettes caused 
cancer.

1245
00:43:38,121 --> 00:43:39,950
And this is what had been done in the 
past.

1246
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:42,590
You know,
the same people are involved in doing it

1247
00:43:42,591 --> 00:43:44,030
with climate change.
But why?

1248
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,110
Uh,
well,

1249
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:50,130
you know,
one time I wrote a piece for the NPR 

1250
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:50,130
that was kind of positive about like,
yeah,

1251
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:50,750
we can switch infrastructure like I'm 
saying.

1252
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,540
And some guy wrote me back very angry 
and he said,

1253
00:43:53,541 --> 00:43:55,100
you know,
the proven reserves,

1254
00:43:55,101 --> 00:43:55,580
you know,
the stuff,

1255
00:43:55,581 --> 00:43:58,910
the oil that's in the ground has a 
wealth,

1256
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:00,650
has a monetary value,
like,

1257
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:02,570
you know,
that's in there in the oil companies,

1258
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,420
banks,
you know,

1259
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:08,430
the,
in their bank accounts of one point 

1260
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:08,430
$5,000,000,000,000.

1261
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:08,430
And like I said,
dude,

1262
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:12,640
you know,
people have gone to war for a lot less 

1263
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:12,640
than one point $5,000,000,000,000,
right?

1264
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:12,640
So,
you know,

1265
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,820
if,
if we were to really be like,

1266
00:44:13,821 --> 00:44:14,900
hey man,
we can't burn that,

1267
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:20,170
you know,
you're gonna have to leave that in the 

1268
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:20,170
ground.
That's likely their bank accounts.

1269
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:22,010
But I'm like zero pretty fast.
So what I don't.

1270
00:44:22,011 --> 00:44:24,530
So it's those industries.
I think that's part of it.

1271
00:44:24,531 --> 00:44:29,531
And then it gets,
you get linked to other things and then 

1272
00:44:29,531 --> 00:44:29,531
it becomes this sort of like mass,
uh,

1273
00:44:29,531 --> 00:44:30,530
you know,
becomes the political poll.

1274
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,880
They use political polarization to sort 
of,

1275
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:33,960
you know,
sort of make this happen.

1276
00:44:33,961 --> 00:44:36,030
It doesn't feel like other countries 
aren't doing this.

1277
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,200
Right.
That's the important thing.

1278
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:38,460
You know,
other countries.

1279
00:44:38,461 --> 00:44:40,110
There's always a little bit of climate 
denial going on,

1280
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:42,120
but we're the only country that's got,
as you can see,

1281
00:44:42,121 --> 00:44:44,610
because we're the only ones who are not 
part of the Paris accord.

1282
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:45,470
Well,
it's one of the

1283
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,340
weirdest things about this right left 
things.

1284
00:44:47,341 --> 00:44:49,320
The left is always supporting the 
environment.

1285
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:53,050
The left is all about the environment.
The left is about clean air and

1286
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:53,880
yeah.
Water.

1287
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,740
How did that happen?
I don't understand.

1288
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:58,390
I don't understand that either.
The whole thing is very strange.

1289
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:58,870
Well,
I got,

1290
00:44:58,871 --> 00:44:59,290
you know,
I mean,

1291
00:44:59,291 --> 00:45:03,130
I have issues with environmental lists 
too because,

1292
00:45:03,131 --> 00:45:08,131
um,
I think one of your shows I was 

1293
00:45:08,131 --> 00:45:08,131
watching,
you know,

1294
00:45:08,131 --> 00:45:08,131
the whole idea of Eco Bros,
right?

1295
00:45:08,131 --> 00:45:08,131
And you get ECO Brode,
but people,

1296
00:45:08,131 --> 00:45:09,820
and I noticed I have a piece in the New 
York Times today,

1297
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:11,620
an op ed where I'm basically saying 
like,

1298
00:45:11,621 --> 00:45:13,090
look man,
the planet's going to be fine.

1299
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:13,540
Like,
you know,

1300
00:45:13,541 --> 00:45:18,541
long term.
There's nothing we can throw at the 

1301
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:18,541
biosphere that is going to kill it.
We're in.

1302
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:18,940
It's not about saving the planet,
the Earth.

1303
00:45:18,941 --> 00:45:21,050
He's not a fuzzy little bunny,
you know,

1304
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,950
the planet is powerful and it's really 
about saving us.

1305
00:45:23,951 --> 00:45:28,951
Let's be honest about what's going on 
and is going to be all kinds of ethical 

1306
00:45:28,951 --> 00:45:28,951
choices that go on that,
you know,

1307
00:45:28,951 --> 00:45:31,180
the polar bears may not be able to come 
along with us on the ride here.

1308
00:45:31,181 --> 00:45:33,430
You know,
we need a healthy biosphere with,

1309
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,880
you know,
a lot of biodiversity,

1310
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:37,030
but you know,
we're part of it and we're going to have

1311
00:45:37,031 --> 00:45:42,031
an impact.
There's no such thing as no impact and 

1312
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:42,031
you know,
already I'm getting ECO brode people,

1313
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:43,600
you know,
you don't care about life.

1314
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:44,890
I just like,
oh,

1315
00:45:44,891 --> 00:45:46,240
come on man.
I just put it in the thing.

1316
00:45:46,241 --> 00:45:48,130
I said we need to be wise and 
compassionate,

1317
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:49,110
you know,
but they're like,

1318
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:49,760
no,
people have

1319
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,750
convening opinions.
I mean this is,

1320
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:56,770
this is one of the things you get 
involved with when you start talking 

1321
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:59,310
with people about really important 
issues.

1322
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,870
I mean,
it's like we were talking about earlier,

1323
00:46:00,871 --> 00:46:04,350
they want to be right and they want to 
be on the sides.

1324
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,510
It's righteous and with virtue in 
ethics,

1325
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,480
right,
they find anything that you disagree,

1326
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:14,710
that they disagree with it.
You're saying they don't ask you 

1327
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:14,710
questions,
they don't go.

1328
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:15,840
What do you think the implications are?
Like how do you,

1329
00:46:15,841 --> 00:46:20,841
how do we minimize the effects and the 
negative consequences of are they just 

1330
00:46:20,841 --> 00:46:23,370
immediately want to say you are 
insensitive.

1331
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,040
You are an asshole.
You are the problem.

1332
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:26,290
Yeah.

1333
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:31,550
You didn't know my way around that and 
that's what the whole book is about is 

1334
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:31,550
to like when you've got a polarization,
right?

1335
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:33,270
You know,
where you're either this or you're that.

1336
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:36,750
The thing that this is like a 
mathematical idea is to go orthogonal.

1337
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:39,060
You know when you,
when you go,

1338
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:40,600
because you know it's a line basically,
right?

1339
00:46:40,601 --> 00:46:43,470
You're either on this side or that side 
go 90 degrees to it.

1340
00:46:43,471 --> 00:46:45,990
Now you're in a whole new space.
Now you're up and down to the left and.

1341
00:46:45,991 --> 00:46:46,710
Right.
Exactly.

1342
00:46:46,711 --> 00:46:51,711
And now like the questions that.
So you see this in like revolutions in 

1343
00:46:51,711 --> 00:46:51,711
science,
right?

1344
00:46:51,711 --> 00:46:56,061
So you look at Einstein and what 
happened when Einstein came up with a 

1345
00:46:56,061 --> 00:46:56,061
relativity,
everybody at the time was like,

1346
00:46:56,061 --> 00:46:56,640
you know,
um,

1347
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:58,620
they were all concerned what they call 
the luminaire forest,

1348
00:46:58,650 --> 00:46:59,320
ether,
you know,

1349
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:04,340
light needed,
like to wave and everybody thought it 

1350
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:04,340
needed something to propagate through,
right radio way or,

1351
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,310
um,
waterways go through water,

1352
00:47:05,311 --> 00:47:06,450
sound,
wave go through air.

1353
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,820
So the whole thing was about this ether.
The Luminous Air Easter is,

1354
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:10,980
this exist,
does not exist,

1355
00:47:10,981 --> 00:47:12,090
but I'm not.
One time I was like,

1356
00:47:12,091 --> 00:47:17,091
you know,
I'm not really interested in that 

1357
00:47:17,091 --> 00:47:17,091
problem.
Am I going to do it?

1358
00:47:17,091 --> 00:47:17,091
He just changed the whole thing and you 
just said,

1359
00:47:17,091 --> 00:47:17,490
look,
here's two new ideas.

1360
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:19,380
They have nothing to do with the 
luminous every either.

1361
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:24,620
And like all the old questions,
all the old battles kind of just fell 

1362
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:25,320
away and they didn't even make sense 
anymore.

1363
00:47:25,321 --> 00:47:26,610
So that's what I'm trying to do in the 
book and say,

1364
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:31,611
look,
when you look at climate change as a 

1365
00:47:31,611 --> 00:47:33,550
planetary transition,
a predictable planetary transition,

1366
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:37,450
the whole idea of environmentalism 
versus business interests.

1367
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:38,090
And,
uh,

1368
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:38,620
you know,
right,

1369
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,450
Republicans versus Democrats,
it just doesn't,

1370
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,370
you know,
it's not even relevant anymore.

1371
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:44,620
What matters is that this is going to 
happen.

1372
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:46,150
We should have expected it to happen.

1373
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:51,390
And now the question is,
do we become a cosmic winter or cosmic 

1374
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:51,550
loser?
And we have to think about the biosphere

1375
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:56,551
differently.
We have to think about our place in the 

1376
00:47:56,551 --> 00:47:56,551
biosphere differently and the old 
arguments.

1377
00:47:56,551 --> 00:48:00,120
So that's what,
you know sometimes with climate change 

1378
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,741
deniers,
I'll throw this stuff at them and it's 

1379
00:48:01,741 --> 00:48:03,691
really kind of fun to watch and be like,
because you're expecting me to say like 

1380
00:48:03,691 --> 00:48:03,691
a,
B and c and they've got d,

1381
00:48:03,691 --> 00:48:05,590
e and F and response and I throw this 
stuff out them and they're just like,

1382
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:07,840
no,
I'm not doing it.

1383
00:48:07,841 --> 00:48:09,730
Just a fight with climate change.
But I think it's true.

1384
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:10,180
But.

1385
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:12,670
Well,
who was it that was on the podcast?

1386
00:48:12,671 --> 00:48:17,671
It was talking about climate 
stabilization techniques and that this 

1387
00:48:17,671 --> 00:48:18,010
is probably the future.
Was it boy?

1388
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,840
Um,
anyway,

1389
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,480
what people are really worried about 
when,

1390
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:29,510
when you talk to people that understand 
the history of the human race and the 

1391
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:32,021
history of the earth is climate cooling.
I think the climate cooling is far more 

1392
00:48:32,021 --> 00:48:34,820
terrifying than climate warming because 
if we go into a giant ice age,

1393
00:48:34,821 --> 00:48:39,821
again,
I mean way more people are gonna die a 

1394
00:48:39,821 --> 00:48:43,900
terrible loss of resources and it can be
devastating to the human race that is.

1395
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,760
Is that,
is that something that you agree with?

1396
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:47,280
Yeah,
no,

1397
00:48:47,281 --> 00:48:48,750
I don't think so.
I mean it's true.

1398
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:52,140
And here's something interesting.
We're kind of overdue for an ice age.

1399
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,220
Yeah,
well that was the thing in the seventies

1400
00:48:54,221 --> 00:48:55,720
there were saying that we're in the 
verge of.

1401
00:48:56,140 --> 00:49:01,140
Yeah,
I mean that there was just a couple of 

1402
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,271
guys,
I mean that whole thing because that's 

1403
00:49:03,271 --> 00:49:03,271
often something that climate deniers 
will throw at you in the seventies,

1404
00:49:03,271 --> 00:49:03,271
you know,
it was like,

1405
00:49:03,271 --> 00:49:07,591
there was like one or two guys who said 
that and then it got picked up on the 

1406
00:49:07,591 --> 00:49:10,201
news,
but the climate community at that time 

1407
00:49:10,201 --> 00:49:10,201
was not like,
oh my God,

1408
00:49:10,201 --> 00:49:10,201
it's cooling.
Right?

1409
00:49:10,201 --> 00:49:13,890
But here's the interesting thing for me 
and at the fits into this whole idea is 

1410
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:14,920
that like we're holding off an ice age,
like there may never be.

1411
00:49:14,921 --> 00:49:18,820
If human humanity is successful and we 
navigate the Anthropocene,

1412
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:23,821
you know,
that term the anthropocene that we've 

1413
00:49:23,821 --> 00:49:25,141
now entered,
we've now entered the human dominated 

1414
00:49:25,141 --> 00:49:25,141
era.
We've been for the last 10,000

1415
00:49:25,141 --> 00:49:29,251
years.
The geological epoch has been what they 

1416
00:49:29,251 --> 00:49:30,781
called the Holocene.
That's all of human civilization 

1417
00:49:30,781 --> 00:49:30,781
happened in the whole scene.

1418
00:49:30,781 --> 00:49:30,781
You know,
it's pretty warm.

1419
00:49:30,781 --> 00:49:31,970
It's pretty wet,
moist,

1420
00:49:31,971 --> 00:49:36,971
you know,
everything's not locked up in ice and 

1421
00:49:36,971 --> 00:49:36,971
it's an inter glacial period.
And if we weren't around,

1422
00:49:36,971 --> 00:49:38,050
yeah,
and another thousand,

1423
00:49:38,051 --> 00:49:40,420
3000,
500 years would be another ice age.

1424
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,720
But the anthropocene that were 
triggering could hold off ice ages 

1425
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,450
forever,
right?

1426
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:51,451
As long as we're around,
there won't be another ice age because 

1427
00:49:51,451 --> 00:49:54,121
we've already added enough warmth to the
planet that it overcomes the effects 

1428
00:49:54,121 --> 00:49:56,971
that trigger an ice age.
So like what are the ethical 

1429
00:49:56,971 --> 00:49:56,971
responsibilities of that?
That's what I try and tell the,

1430
00:49:56,971 --> 00:49:57,910
you know,
the environmentalists like,

1431
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:02,911
you know,
you've got this image like oh we got to 

1432
00:50:02,911 --> 00:50:04,471
save the earth,
but they're thinking of like the whole 

1433
00:50:04,471 --> 00:50:04,471
scene and it's like,
well,

1434
00:50:04,471 --> 00:50:05,290
you know,
the planet even with us,

1435
00:50:05,291 --> 00:50:10,291
even if we successfully keep 
biodiversity rich and it's not going to 

1436
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:10,540
be the earth we started with,
you know,

1437
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:12,340
because we're here.
So yeah.

1438
00:50:12,341 --> 00:50:16,600
What about the species that never form 
because we held off the ice age.

1439
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,320
No,
I mean forever.

1440
00:50:18,321 --> 00:50:19,860
Like what about the ethical 
responsibility though?

1441
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:23,180
So like it opens for.
That is a long equation though,

1442
00:50:23,181 --> 00:50:24,340
isn't it?
Uh,

1443
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:25,130
in what way?

1444
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,010
Try to contemplate what would have 
existed

1445
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:31,910
if we allow the earth to cool and our 
responsibility for allowing the earth to

1446
00:50:31,911 --> 00:50:34,880
cool so that the potential for new 
species to advance.

1447
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:37,130
It's like fuck those pieces.
Let's keep,

1448
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:39,740
let's keep this place warm so we can 
stay alive.

1449
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:40,430
Well,
all I'm saying,

1450
00:50:40,431 --> 00:50:41,690
the only reason I'm raising that I'm 
not,

1451
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,400
you know,
I'm raising that because we don't.

1452
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:48,460
When we talk about climate change,
what you get sometimes when the 

1453
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:48,460
environmental movement is this sort of 
like the polar bear,

1454
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:49,910
the polar bear.
It's like what I'm trying to say,

1455
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:51,170
look,
I love polar bears.

1456
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:56,400
Kind of funny that polar bears always 
think because polar bears will rip your 

1457
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,250
head off and drink your.
And not only that,

1458
00:50:58,251 --> 00:51:00,710
then one of the rare bears,
it doesn't need anything but me.

1459
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:01,460
Yeah,
right.

1460
00:51:01,461 --> 00:51:02,630
Right.
And so it's so funny that we're like,

1461
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:05,750
oh,
Kevin is a biologist,

1462
00:51:05,751 --> 00:51:08,180
and he said like,
when you get polar bear babies,

1463
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:09,980
like right out of the womb,
you said they're like the,

1464
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:13,160
like the alien from the chest,
chest burster steam.

1465
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:17,390
He said that literally like right out of
the womb,

1466
00:51:17,391 --> 00:51:19,010
they're looking to kill and eat.
You're like,

1467
00:51:19,011 --> 00:51:20,090
oh,
you're so good.

1468
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:24,200
That is a fucking.
Obviously people have tamed them and Fed

1469
00:51:24,201 --> 00:51:27,110
them to the point where they don't in 
your head off.

1470
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:32,140
Yeah.
But that's a fucking predatory enormous 

1471
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:32,140
animal.
Yeah.

1472
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:32,980
So I'm,
I'm raising that point to say like,

1473
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:36,200
look,
the thing we're going through now is a,

1474
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:38,690
it's an epic making planetary 
transition.

1475
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:39,770
We were part of it,
right?

1476
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,870
And whether or not we're still part,
that's the question whether or not we're

1477
00:51:41,871 --> 00:51:44,210
still part of it a thousand years from 
now,

1478
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,470
you know,
is the big issue.

1479
00:51:45,471 --> 00:51:45,950
So,
you know,

1480
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:48,260
there are ethical issues about the polar
bear,

1481
00:51:48,261 --> 00:51:50,540
right?
But there are also ethical issue.

1482
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,050
We can't just return the earth to some 
pristine state.

1483
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,880
We're here,
there's 7 billion of us,

1484
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:58,280
you know,
so you have to,

1485
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:03,520
we're going to have to understand like 
there's this deeper ethical question 

1486
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,431
about what is an earth look like that's 
been changed by us that's healthy but 

1487
00:52:06,431 --> 00:52:06,431
still has us on it.

1488
00:52:06,431 --> 00:52:08,150
It may not have polar bears,
you know,

1489
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,940
it may have rich phyto plankton,
you know,

1490
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,850
uh,
and it may be a very species diverse,

1491
00:52:13,851 --> 00:52:15,500
but some of the species may not come 
with us.

1492
00:52:15,501 --> 00:52:17,360
So like we can't this sort of like 
things like,

1493
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:22,390
oh,
the pristine or if there is no more 

1494
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:22,390
pristine earth,
we,

1495
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:24,820
you know,
we've been changing the earth since we 

1496
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:24,820
were here.
So it's like how do we have a healthy,

1497
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:29,471
a rich,
healthy biosphere with us and our 

1498
00:52:29,471 --> 00:52:31,931
civilization still in it.
And the thing about things that have 

1499
00:52:31,931 --> 00:52:35,651
gone extinct in the past and more than 
90 percent of everything that's ever 

1500
00:52:35,651 --> 00:52:37,880
existed is extinct.
Problem is we didn't know then.

1501
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,080
Right?
We didn't have a,

1502
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,840
you know,
a checklist like,

1503
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,240
oh,
spotted owl,

1504
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:45,170
check.
Got It.

1505
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:46,670
No tree frog.
Check.

1506
00:52:46,671 --> 00:52:48,200
Got It.
Now we do.

1507
00:52:48,201 --> 00:52:49,940
And when one goes away we kind of freak 
out.

1508
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,690
Yeah.
And that's,

1509
00:52:50,691 --> 00:52:51,260
you know,
I mean,

1510
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:56,530
you know,
we have to have compassion for life 

1511
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:56,530
because we're part of it without the 
compassion,

1512
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:56,530
you know,
we end up with a,

1513
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:58,670
as a Gavin Schmidt,
a friend of mine calls economic.

1514
00:52:58,671 --> 00:53:00,740
We have ecological hooliganism,
right?

1515
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:02,750
We just do crazy.
We're just dumping Shit into rivers.

1516
00:53:02,751 --> 00:53:03,050
Like,
yeah,

1517
00:53:03,051 --> 00:53:04,930
you don't have to do that man.
Um,

1518
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:05,840
but,
you know,

1519
00:53:05,841 --> 00:53:08,330
when in my talks on this,
I'll show like the polar bear,

1520
00:53:08,331 --> 00:53:10,810
the lonely polar bear on the island and 
you know,

1521
00:53:10,811 --> 00:53:12,770
like all you have once really bummed out
about this.

1522
00:53:12,771 --> 00:53:14,540
And then I'll show like a velociraptor,
right?

1523
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:18,890
You know who's crying for the 
velociraptor species come and go.

1524
00:53:18,891 --> 00:53:20,100
So we have to,
you know,

1525
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,070
and the earth goes to these huge 
transitions.

1526
00:53:22,071 --> 00:53:24,350
I'm not saying be like don't care about 
those species,

1527
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:27,120
but you got to have bigger picture with 
us in it.

1528
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:28,500
Here's the problem with the,
with the,

1529
00:53:28,501 --> 00:53:30,480
uh,
the environmental movements.

1530
00:53:30,481 --> 00:53:31,560
You know what though?
Sometimes the,

1531
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:36,600
it gets framed.
It's not just the environment in which 

1532
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:36,600
the way we talk about climate change,
we think of ourselves as being a plague,

1533
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,080
right?
A human beings,

1534
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:38,280
we suck,
right?

1535
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,470
That's the basic.
That's the only story.

1536
00:53:40,471 --> 00:53:41,520
You,
we have two stories.

1537
00:53:41,521 --> 00:53:44,320
It's not happening or we suck.
And my whole thing is like,

1538
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:47,010
that is the raw.
Not only is that story wrong,

1539
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:49,170
it's unhelpful.
You know,

1540
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:53,340
we are what the biosphere is doing now.
You know,

1541
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:58,370
millions of years ago it was grasslands.
Grasslands were a new innovation and 

1542
00:53:58,370 --> 00:53:59,470
they changed the planet.
You have a lot of grass,

1543
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,960
you know,
the biosphere evolved,

1544
00:54:00,961 --> 00:54:03,540
grasslands,
they swept across the planet.

1545
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:06,570
They changed how the planet works.
And then the earth moved on with it.

1546
00:54:06,571 --> 00:54:09,930
Went onto the new experiment.
We are what the were exactly that we are

1547
00:54:09,931 --> 00:54:14,931
like the dinosaurs or the grasslands or 
the blue green algae that created the 

1548
00:54:14,931 --> 00:54:16,470
oxygen atmosphere and like,
you know,

1549
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:17,270
we're not,
we're,

1550
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:22,340
you know,
there's no difference between a city in 

1551
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:22,340
a forest on some biospheric level.

1552
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:26,570
We don't suck.
The question is whether we're smart 

1553
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:28,731
enough to still be part of what the,
what the biosphere is using us to 

1554
00:54:28,731 --> 00:54:28,731
trigger,
you know what I mean?

1555
00:54:28,731 --> 00:54:33,440
Yeah.
What are your thoughts on the 

1556
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,260
reintroduction of extinct animals 
through genetic cloning?

1557
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:36,300
Uh,
you know,

1558
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:41,330
I watched her risk park whether they're 
talking about doing like with William 

1559
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:42,030
mammoths.
Yeah.

1560
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:47,090
This is a real possibility.
Something I know the close ancestor of 

1561
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:50,750
the woolly mammoth is still alive.
I know I'd be down for seeing in my,

1562
00:54:50,751 --> 00:54:51,220
in my,
the moon,

1563
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:56,250
the science museum in Rochester.
There's a woolly mammoth that they 

1564
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:56,250
found,
you know,

1565
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:57,960
and sometimes looking at anything like 
that giant hairy ass elephant man.

1566
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,640
And it was walking around right in my,
you know,

1567
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:02,310
I think like,
depending on what you do with it,

1568
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:07,340
you know,
trying to reintroduce it into the 

1569
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:07,340
biosphere could be a little dangerous.

1570
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:07,340
I mean,
the thing,

1571
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:08,400
look,
climate change is a,

1572
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,230
this is something I like say climate 
change is not our fault.

1573
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:12,150
And what I mean by that is we,
uh,

1574
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:15,000
we found fossil fuels and they were 
awesome,

1575
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:20,050
you know,
and they were just a continuation of 

1576
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:20,050
what we'd always done,
you know.

1577
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:21,300
And so we inadvertently,
climate change was a mistake,

1578
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:22,590
you know,
now,

1579
00:55:22,591 --> 00:55:24,540
if we don't do something about it,
it's our fault,

1580
00:55:24,541 --> 00:55:24,990
right?
But,

1581
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:30,020
you know,
and so you want to be really careful 

1582
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:30,020
about unintended consequences,
you know.

1583
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:30,760
So this is my same thing with,
uh,

1584
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:31,850
uh,
with geoengineering.

1585
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:32,760
People talk like,
Oh,

1586
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:33,300
we should,
you know,

1587
00:55:33,301 --> 00:55:36,900
put a part of particulates in the 
atmosphere to make it more reflective.

1588
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:37,620
I'm like,
man,

1589
00:55:37,621 --> 00:55:38,440
dude,
we triggered the whole,

1590
00:55:38,441 --> 00:55:40,360
we triggered a climate change because,
you know,

1591
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:45,380
we didn't know what we were doing.
We didn't know what the consequences 

1592
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:45,380
were.

1593
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:45,380
We put those articles up there,
how do we get them out,

1594
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:46,520
get them out with a net?
Well,

1595
00:55:46,521 --> 00:55:46,760
no,
no.

1596
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,690
They'll reign down.
You've got to keep putting them in.

1597
00:55:48,691 --> 00:55:50,460
That's the problem.
You got to keep putting them in.

1598
00:55:50,461 --> 00:55:55,461
So what happens if like one nation 
decides they don't want to do it 

1599
00:55:55,461 --> 00:55:55,461
anymore,
you know,

1600
00:55:55,461 --> 00:55:55,890
and there the whole thing falls apart.
Now suddenly are,

1601
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:59,400
you're gonna get massive changes and so 
like anything like that,

1602
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:02,010
like why don't we just work on Matt 
using fossil fuels?

1603
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:07,190
You know what I mean?
I take the hardest solution that's got 

1604
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:07,190
the most uncertainty as opposed to the 
simpler solution,

1605
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:08,910
which just means building a different 
infrastructure.

1606
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:11,070
Yeah.
Well especially in California.

1607
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:16,490
I mean this is one of the weirdest 
places ever to not see solar power when 

1608
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:17,190
it never.
It never rained.

1609
00:56:17,191 --> 00:56:18,840
Should be everywhere,
everywhere.

1610
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,030
Most things should be run on solar 
power.

1611
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:23,150
Why not man?
You got solar and so efficient now.

1612
00:56:23,151 --> 00:56:25,960
Like it's also very difficult to get up 
and running.

1613
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:31,250
Like I had a friend of mine who had his 
done for four or five months before he 

1614
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:35,641
got approved because he said they,
they make it difficult for you.

1615
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:40,910
Yeah.
Which is crazy to be on solar power and 

1616
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:40,910
not be on the grid.
So,

1617
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:41,890
you know,
I mean these are all the kinds of things

1618
00:56:41,891 --> 00:56:43,930
that we're going to have to work out.
I'm hopeful people are like,

1619
00:56:43,931 --> 00:56:45,300
are you hopeful or not hopeful?
Because you know,

1620
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,260
I mean I ran these,
I did these models.

1621
00:56:47,261 --> 00:56:52,261
One of the pieces of research we did was
we modeled planets and civilizations 

1622
00:56:52,261 --> 00:56:52,261
like alien civilizations.
We,

1623
00:56:52,261 --> 00:56:57,070
you know,
developed a simple mathematical model 

1624
00:56:57,070 --> 00:56:59,430
about how a civilization will use that 
planet's resources to make more babies 

1625
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:01,060
alien babies.
And then how the,

1626
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,800
you know,
by using those resources you feedback on

1627
00:57:02,801 --> 00:57:03,220
the planet.

1628
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:08,220
Right.
And so what we wanted to do was we 

1629
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:08,290
wanted to model the possible outcomes.
Like what is the generic outcome,

1630
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:09,730
you know,
if I've got 100,000

1631
00:57:09,731 --> 00:57:11,620
civilizations all being born in 
different places,

1632
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,270
what's the,
you know,

1633
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,970
in general what happens?
And what we found is like basically four

1634
00:57:15,971 --> 00:57:18,490
different possibilities.
One was good news,

1635
00:57:18,491 --> 00:57:20,560
like in these models there was like,
you know,

1636
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,920
the population shoots up,
the planet's temperature shoots up,

1637
00:57:23,921 --> 00:57:25,570
but they come to a nice steady state,
like,

1638
00:57:25,571 --> 00:57:25,960
you know,
you know,

1639
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:27,730
the population stable,
everything's good.

1640
00:57:27,731 --> 00:57:32,590
So they're in those models was hope.
We also saw die off.

1641
00:57:32,591 --> 00:57:35,020
We're like the population skyrockets the
planet,

1642
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:40,530
they overshoot the carrying capacity of 
their planet and then you get something 

1643
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:40,530
like 70 percent of the population died 
off.

1644
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:41,080
So like,
you know,

1645
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,180
seven out of every 10 people you know is
gone,

1646
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:48,570
so you know,
but then you come to a steady state so 

1647
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:48,570
low maybe if you can survive the 
disaster you can,

1648
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:49,030
you're still there.

1649
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,400
But we also problem with survivor,
the disasters,

1650
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:53,260
how much of the information gets her 
story,

1651
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:58,460
right?
Because you think about if you killing 

1652
00:57:58,460 --> 00:57:58,460
seven out of 10 people,
how many of those seven people,

1653
00:57:58,460 --> 00:57:58,830
the ones who know how to make cell 
phones.

1654
00:57:58,831 --> 00:57:59,470
Yeah,
exactly.

1655
00:57:59,471 --> 00:58:00,440
That's a dark age,
right?

1656
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:05,460
That's what happens to the dark age.
I remember the first time I went to 

1657
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:05,460
Europe and I smelled it was Roman,
you know,

1658
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:06,220
the aqueducts man,
like five stories tall carrying water,

1659
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:11,550
you know,
and by the 918 nobody knew how they got 

1660
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:12,310
built a few of those dips in human 
civilization.

1661
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:13,450
Right?
And so it's not clear,

1662
00:58:13,451 --> 00:58:15,400
especially with the society as complex 
as ours,

1663
00:58:15,401 --> 00:58:18,190
right?
If the food doesn't arrive in my grocery

1664
00:58:18,191 --> 00:58:19,600
store,
what do I do?

1665
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:20,230
Right?
You know,

1666
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:21,750
I garden,
but I'm not,

1667
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:27,030
not enough.
Not enough to keep you alive for a 

1668
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:27,030
complex civilization like ours.

1669
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:29,740
Even if you don't go extinct,
you may not be able to have this kind of

1670
00:58:29,741 --> 00:58:31,960
civilization.
But we did find collapse.

1671
00:58:31,961 --> 00:58:35,440
We did find complete extinction curves 
as well where,

1672
00:58:35,441 --> 00:58:40,441
you know,
the population went way up and then 

1673
00:58:40,441 --> 00:58:40,441
boom,
dropped like a stone and wood even we've

1674
00:58:40,441 --> 00:58:41,830
and found those.
We built into the model as a possibility

1675
00:58:41,831 --> 00:58:46,831
for the civilization to switch from a 
high impact resource to a low impact 

1676
00:58:46,831 --> 00:58:47,500
resource like fossil to solar.
And sometimes because you know,

1677
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,450
planets have minds of their own,
you know,

1678
00:58:49,451 --> 00:58:52,180
and there's an internal dynamics,
the planets and you push them far enough

1679
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:57,390
and there's going to roll off.
So we'd have ones where the population 

1680
00:58:57,390 --> 00:59:00,751
went way up.
They made the switch and then the 

1681
00:59:00,751 --> 00:59:00,751
population started to come down on the 
planet.

1682
00:59:00,751 --> 00:59:04,261
Started to cool down.
Did you factor in random geological 

1683
00:59:04,261 --> 00:59:05,890
events?
Random solar events,

1684
00:59:05,891 --> 00:59:06,550
random.

1685
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:12,750
This was really all about just planet a 
civilization and it's feedback on the 

1686
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:12,750
plan.
And you could,

1687
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:17,251
we could build models like that.
That would be one of the major issues 

1688
00:59:17,251 --> 00:59:20,971
with any advanced civilizations.
It's a matter of time before something 

1689
00:59:20,971 --> 00:59:20,971
happens,
right?

1690
00:59:20,971 --> 00:59:21,970
As we said,
you know,

1691
00:59:21,971 --> 00:59:26,971
we know that Mars has been hit before we
go or spin hit the moon's been head 

1692
00:59:26,971 --> 00:59:30,671
everything.
I mean the moon is one of our best 

1693
00:59:30,671 --> 00:59:33,190
examples would just look at it.
You see craters everywhere because it 

1694
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:36,761
doesn't have an environment or an 
atmosphere on the moon was built by a 

1695
00:59:36,761 --> 00:59:37,100
huge impact between earth and Mars on 
Mars,

1696
00:59:37,101 --> 00:59:37,870
like bottom,
you know,

1697
00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:39,110
at the beginning of the planet's 
history.

1698
00:59:39,111 --> 00:59:40,310
So yeah,
those happen all the time.

1699
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:41,590
I think if you get advanced,
you know,

1700
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,000
so like we're on the lip of being a 
multi planet species.

1701
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:45,530
Right.
And once you do that,

1702
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,750
which means you become a space faring 
race,

1703
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,690
then I think like certainly the asteroid
stuff you can take care of.

1704
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:51,680
Right?
We've already done,

1705
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:56,060
we have identified like a huge fraction 
of all the earth crossing asteroids,

1706
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:59,210
like we're not really sure what to do 
about them if we find one coming at us.

1707
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:04,270
But we see some coming out us all the 
time where they just recognize them a 

1708
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:04,270
few hours before near.
Right,

1709
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:09,120
right.
But it doesn't happen a couple of weeks 

1710
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:09,120
ago and you know,
luckily it always passes.

1711
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:09,730
You can always.
Yeah.

1712
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:11,300
So we couldn't really,
you know,

1713
01:00:11,301 --> 01:00:14,330
we're young enough now that if we 
discovered one heading right towards us,

1714
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:16,590
we could just put down your legs between
your head,

1715
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,830
between your legs and kiss your butt 
goodbye.

1716
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:20,600
Um,
but uh,

1717
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:21,650
but in time,
right,

1718
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:26,651
200 years from now,
we will have done a much better job of 

1719
01:00:26,651 --> 01:00:26,651
mapping out all the major rocks.
Yeah.

1720
01:00:26,651 --> 01:00:27,080
Well,
I think so,

1721
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:28,330
I mean I'm really says,
you know,

1722
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:31,370
I mean if we have that kind of planetary
interplanetary,

1723
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:36,640
we're going to be mapping them out just 
because you don't want to run into them 

1724
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:36,640
or are you going to be mining them?

1725
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,480
What do you think is a promising in 
terms of the ability to prevent impacts?

1726
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,880
Uh,
there's a couple of things.

1727
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:42,890
I think the best one,
if you catch it early enough,

1728
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,030
there's the gravity tug.
Will you just literally park a spaceship

1729
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,900
next to it and slowly have the 
spaceship,

1730
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:53,230
you know,
move yo because you only have to do is 

1731
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:53,230
altered the trajectory a little bit.
You know,

1732
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:53,780
you just don't have the long bonnet.
Yeah.

1733
01:00:53,781 --> 01:00:54,500
And it'll,
you know,

1734
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:57,920
I'm [inaudible] shit and spaces just so 
vast that a little tap,

1735
01:00:57,921 --> 01:00:59,980
we'll make it miss.
So the gravity Tokyo,

1736
01:00:59,981 --> 01:01:01,730
you don't have to try and do the pot.
What was it?

1737
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:06,760
What was the movie apocalypse?
The one with the from the nineties with 

1738
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:06,760
the,
uh,

1739
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:07,790
the space miners.
Oh,

1740
01:01:07,791 --> 01:01:09,050
Armageddon.
Armageddon.

1741
01:01:09,051 --> 01:01:09,650
Yeah.
Thank you.

1742
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,040
And then there was a deep impact to deep
impact was the smart one.

1743
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:15,050
Yeah.
Armageddon was the rip each other's off,

1744
01:01:15,051 --> 01:01:20,051
right,
because they're both came out at the 

1745
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:20,051
same time and I think deep impact came 
out first,

1746
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:20,890
but it was developed second.
Ah,

1747
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:26,080
yeah,
that'd be a bummer to be the one that 

1748
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:26,080
like,
you know,

1749
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:26,960
they both come out at the same time and 
your movie doesn't get any attention and

1750
01:01:26,961 --> 01:01:28,760
the other one becomes like a massive 
hit.

1751
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:30,560
Wow.
So,

1752
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:31,130
uh,
so like,

1753
01:01:31,131 --> 01:01:36,131
you know,
there they drilled holes and stuff and 

1754
01:01:36,131 --> 01:01:38,090
try and blow them up,
but then the problem there is you now 

1755
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:38,090
have a bunch of rocks and if some of 
those rocks are big enough.

1756
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:39,620
So I think the gravity tug is kind of 
probably the best idea.

1757
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:40,770
But you know,
because of um,

1758
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,740
a mining asteroids will probably,
you know,

1759
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:44,600
those little ones maybe the easiest to 
you know,

1760
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:49,601
to mind.
So what are you worried about more than 

1761
01:01:49,601 --> 01:01:51,200
anything in terms of climate change?

1762
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:54,320
Like you worried about the rising of the
ocean levels.

1763
01:01:54,321 --> 01:01:57,080
Are you worried about the heating of the
actual planet,

1764
01:01:57,590 --> 01:02:00,410
the temperature being unsustainable for 
human life?

1765
01:02:00,411 --> 01:02:01,600
Like what are you worried about the 
most?

1766
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:03,080
Uh,
the one thing I'm worried about the most

1767
01:02:03,081 --> 01:02:04,250
liquid we're talking before,
you know,

1768
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:07,700
technological societies are these like 
overlaid networks,

1769
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:09,560
you know,
you got the transportation network,

1770
01:02:09,561 --> 01:02:11,660
you've got the energy network,
you've got social networks,

1771
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:13,490
you know,
and those are really complex.

1772
01:02:13,491 --> 01:02:18,491
And so I do a little what's called 
network theory and what you find with 

1773
01:02:18,491 --> 01:02:18,491
network theory is that,
you know,

1774
01:02:18,491 --> 01:02:20,190
you may have an individual network 
that's pretty robust,

1775
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,680
meaning like I can cut some of the 
connections,

1776
01:02:22,681 --> 01:02:24,270
like you got your social network,
I could take,

1777
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:29,560
you know,
20 percent of the people out of your 

1778
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:29,560
social network and the social like will 
still function,

1779
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:30,060
you know,
like most people will still talk to each

1780
01:02:30,061 --> 01:02:32,160
other or anything,
but once you start layering them,

1781
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:37,190
so at the social network is now 
connected to the telecommunications 

1782
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:37,190
network which is connected to the energy
network,

1783
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:37,560
Blah Blah.

1784
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,730
Then you can repeat a small change 
ripples through the whole thing blows it

1785
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:42,180
apart.
It just doesn't function anymore.

1786
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:47,510
So you know,
I don't need like apocalypses to have 

1787
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:49,650
the fabric of technological civilization
fall apart.

1788
01:02:49,651 --> 01:02:50,220
Like,
so if the,

1789
01:02:50,221 --> 01:02:55,221
if just the weather patterns change 
enough that agriculture becomes really 

1790
01:02:55,221 --> 01:02:55,221
hard,
you know,

1791
01:02:55,221 --> 01:03:00,170
we're used to the rain's falling pretty 
much the same way they do yearly and 

1792
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:00,810
everything that,
you know,

1793
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:04,230
like we talk about,
you look at what the refugees,

1794
01:03:04,231 --> 01:03:09,231
how much trouble you know,
having a huge influx of refugees can 

1795
01:03:09,231 --> 01:03:13,221
cause climate change is going to have 
people moving all over the planet 

1796
01:03:13,221 --> 01:03:13,221
because now they can't grow food 
anywhere.

1797
01:03:13,221 --> 01:03:13,880
So it's like I don't,
you know,

1798
01:03:13,881 --> 01:03:14,910
like I said,
you don't need.

1799
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,610
I do worry like ocean rise is going to 
be huge.

1800
01:03:17,611 --> 01:03:22,611
Most people live in coastal cities.
Most of the wealth in the world is in 

1801
01:03:22,611 --> 01:03:25,431
coastal cities,
but you don't really need too much to 

1802
01:03:25,431 --> 01:03:29,091
like really shift the weather patterns.
And then the thing you're used to falls 

1803
01:03:29,091 --> 01:03:29,091
apart

1804
01:03:29,091 --> 01:03:33,580
now when you factor in human beings and 
our evolution from primitive hominids to

1805
01:03:35,831 --> 01:03:40,831
what we are today.
And you sort of extrapolate and keep 

1806
01:03:40,831 --> 01:03:41,740
going and think about what we're going 
to be in the future.

1807
01:03:41,741 --> 01:03:46,741
And then think about what these 
creatures might be that live 100 million

1808
01:03:47,621 --> 01:03:52,300
light years away or whatever.
The fuck it is what I mean we've got,

1809
01:03:52,301 --> 01:03:56,440
I've got to think that whatever is 
holding us back,

1810
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:01,500
our primitive instincts,
these human reward systems that were 

1811
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:06,361
engaged when we were running away from 
wild animals and fighting off tribes 

1812
01:04:06,361 --> 01:04:10,951
have invaders that slowly but surely 
those are going to either evaporate or 

1813
01:04:11,231 --> 01:04:16,231
evolve and we're going to get to a point
where we can be more rational about 

1814
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:20,581
complex issues if we do do that.
Like what is the motivation for 

1815
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:26,720
expanding the human race?
Isn't sustaining the human race in a 

1816
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:31,221
healthy way on this planet a better 
option than traveling to Mars or 

1817
01:04:31,621 --> 01:04:36,570
traveling to other solar systems?
Like wouldn't we be better served trying

1818
01:04:36,571 --> 01:04:40,740
to achieve some sort of a balance here 
on this planet?

1819
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:42,670
I think the,
um,

1820
01:04:42,970 --> 01:04:45,490
I think one serves the other.
Like we,

1821
01:04:45,491 --> 01:04:47,800
you know,
you look at the human migration patterns

1822
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:48,770
from when we started,
right?

1823
01:04:48,771 --> 01:04:49,720
And you know,
we started off as a,

1824
01:04:49,721 --> 01:04:50,860
you know,
a bunch of people in Africa,

1825
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:52,240
Africa,
maybe a few thousand,

1826
01:04:52,241 --> 01:04:54,940
right?
And then you see this migration like,

1827
01:04:54,941 --> 01:04:56,470
or you know,
a bunch of us,

1828
01:04:56,471 --> 01:04:59,740
like a few hundred crossed the Red Sea,
which was pretty low at the time.

1829
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:02,950
And then it's like they just worked 
their way around the coasts,

1830
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:05,920
you know,
boats over to Australia went all the way

1831
01:05:05,921 --> 01:05:08,470
back around through like we're 
explorers,

1832
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:09,040
man.
Like these,

1833
01:05:09,041 --> 01:05:09,670
you know,
it's really,

1834
01:05:09,671 --> 01:05:14,671
I think something fundamental for us 
psychologically to have these frontiers.

1835
01:05:15,791 --> 01:05:20,791
Exactly.
That's my question is will we evolve 

1836
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:20,791
past that?
Well,

1837
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:21,030
I don't think that's a bad thing.
I don't think so.

1838
01:05:21,031 --> 01:05:21,370
Yeah.
Yeah.

1839
01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:23,170
I don't think this bad thing because 
again,

1840
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:24,370
it goes back to the biosphere.

1841
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:29,370
This is kind of like,
I think there's something deep in life 

1842
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:29,370
that wants more life.
Right?

1843
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:29,680
So if we call,
you know,

1844
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,030
Settle Mars,
right,

1845
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:33,610
then it's not going to be really us 
settling Mars.

1846
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,440
It's going to be the earth's biosphere,
right.

1847
01:05:35,441 --> 01:05:39,010
I mean really are we are,
we're the agent of the biosphere.

1848
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:39,820
Right.
And you know,

1849
01:05:39,821 --> 01:05:41,260
the biosphere started off as like,
you know,

1850
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:44,830
single celled creatures in like little 
tiny parts of the planet.

1851
01:05:44,831 --> 01:05:48,030
And then you have conquered the oceans.
And then eventually when they were,

1852
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:49,450
because in the beginning there weren't 
continents,

1853
01:05:49,451 --> 01:05:51,640
there was a water world when we started 
off.

1854
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:52,220
And so when,
you know,

1855
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,140
there was enough continence,
um,

1856
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:55,540
you know,
then they took over the life,

1857
01:05:55,541 --> 01:05:57,220
took over the land.
I think it's just Kinda,

1858
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:00,440
life may be kind of like a cosmic force,
if I can get ugly on you,

1859
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:04,510
if we do go to Mars and will essentially
be ultimate panspermia.

1860
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:05,650
Yes,
exactly.

1861
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:06,240
Right.
Yeah.

1862
01:06:06,241 --> 01:06:06,970
And that way,
right.

1863
01:06:06,971 --> 01:06:11,971
Panspermia,
which is we were always a weird word to 

1864
01:06:11,971 --> 01:06:13,750
kind of pants for me because people feel
weird about sperms whenever I give an 

1865
01:06:14,711 --> 01:06:15,520
academic talk.
And I'm like,

1866
01:06:16,330 --> 01:06:21,330
I know it's a strange when you say sperm
in front of people that are like you 

1867
01:06:21,330 --> 01:06:21,330
piece of shit.
Yeah,

1868
01:06:21,330 --> 01:06:22,540
right.
It's like a scientific term,

1869
01:06:22,541 --> 01:06:23,440
man.
I swear a matter.

1870
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:25,330
It's like saying niggardly.
Yeah.

1871
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:28,100
Right.
So it's very difficult word to say.

1872
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:29,830
No,
it has nothing to do with the n word.

1873
01:06:29,831 --> 01:06:30,820
Yeah.
So,

1874
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:31,810
um,
uh,

1875
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:32,590
you know,
I think,

1876
01:06:32,591 --> 01:06:34,750
I think it's part of life.
I think life wants more life.

1877
01:06:34,751 --> 01:06:36,010
And this is the question you're raising 
about,

1878
01:06:36,011 --> 01:06:37,800
look,
what do we look like in a million years?

1879
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:40,710
What happens to a species that become.
And you know,

1880
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,100
now we're in the realm of science 
fiction,

1881
01:06:42,101 --> 01:06:43,830
but it's all cool.
Um,

1882
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:49,530
you know,
like what might we become like the gods 

1883
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:49,530
in some scenes.

1884
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:52,790
I think that this is my theory and I've 
thrown this out so many times,

1885
01:06:52,791 --> 01:06:57,791
people are sick of it,
but I think that what we're looking at 

1886
01:06:57,791 --> 01:07:00,131
when we see these archetypal aliens with
the big heads and the big eyes and the 

1887
01:07:00,131 --> 01:07:04,361
tiny bodies and no genitals,
I think we think this is what we're 

1888
01:07:04,361 --> 01:07:07,560
eventually going to be.
We're going to move past that man.

1889
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:12,580
I'll see you in your panspermia and I'll
raise you typically typically talking 

1890
01:07:17,121 --> 01:07:22,121
about gender.
This is the problem and this is why we 

1891
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:23,950
need diversity.
Um,

1892
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:29,200
I just think that if we.
So those are archetypes kind of built 

1893
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,170
into some sense that we're moving pat.
Like,

1894
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:31,460
well,
what did we used to be?

1895
01:07:31,461 --> 01:07:32,810
Well,
we used to be monkeys,

1896
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:34,250
right?
What are we going to be?

1897
01:07:34,251 --> 01:07:37,840
What we're going to be that thing,
that thing that can levitate things,

1898
01:07:37,841 --> 01:07:40,640
but it's mind the thing to communicate 
telepathically,

1899
01:07:40,910 --> 01:07:45,910
that thing that has this incredible 
ability to map out the cosmos and create

1900
01:07:46,941 --> 01:07:51,941
wormholes and the super advanced 
advanced to a point where we can't even 

1901
01:07:52,851 --> 01:07:55,820
comprehend.
So like if you think about how,

1902
01:07:55,850 --> 01:08:00,850
what,
you know w w we evolved from at one 

1903
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:03,050
point in time,
we split from mollusks like what?

1904
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:05,310
600 something

1905
01:08:06,110 --> 01:08:07,210
years ago.
It's got to be on it.

1906
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:09,230
It's got to be past the Cambrian 
explosion,

1907
01:08:09,231 --> 01:08:09,770
but you know,
it's like,

1908
01:08:09,771 --> 01:08:10,500
yeah,
300,

1909
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:11,620
400.
I don't know yet.

1910
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:13,250
So awhile ago.
How,

1911
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,040
how much does a squid understand about

1912
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:20,990
cell phone networks and whether or not 
it's sprint's unlimited data plan plans.

1913
01:08:20,991 --> 01:08:25,991
Really any good picked out.
We'll we'll extrapolate that to what 

1914
01:08:25,991 --> 01:08:30,600
this alien creature is going to be in 
terms of its understanding of time and 

1915
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:35,351
space and matter versus ours.
We are this crude thing that's weirded 

1916
01:08:35,451 --> 01:08:40,451
out by the word sperm.
Whereas it is telepathically 

1917
01:08:40,451 --> 01:08:44,051
communicating with a universal language 
and it has this unbelievable ability to 

1918
01:08:44,051 --> 01:08:47,120
manipulate matter and they've achieved 
homeostasis with their environment.

1919
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:50,000
No longer have this.
Well that's one of the things about,

1920
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:51,230
you know,
there's the Fermi paradox,

1921
01:08:51,231 --> 01:08:51,510
right?
Yeah.

1922
01:08:51,550 --> 01:08:53,610
Like why haven't we seen so,
you know,

1923
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:58,640
as I already said,
we haven't looked enough to say that 

1924
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:58,640
the,
we haven't seen evidence of life,

1925
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,330
right.
It's like opening your door and goes,

1926
01:08:59,331 --> 01:09:03,680
well where are all the buffalo to go to 
Wyoming.

1927
01:09:06,610 --> 01:09:07,070
But there,
you know,

1928
01:09:07,071 --> 01:09:09,890
there is a kind of a problem with 
because we just do a paper on this now,

1929
01:09:09,891 --> 01:09:11,540
you know,
part of the permit paradox.

1930
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:13,400
Let's go.
I don't want to go too far on this.

1931
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:15,550
Can we can go back circle back?
Um,

1932
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:17,840
I liked it.
So he had ducks is fascinating.

1933
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:18,440
It is,
right?

1934
01:09:18,441 --> 01:09:19,150
So the,
so the,

1935
01:09:19,151 --> 01:09:20,720
the,
the idea that we had two people.

1936
01:09:20,850 --> 01:09:25,850
Okay.
So the Fermi paradox is the idea that 

1937
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:25,850
like,
uh,

1938
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:25,850
you know,
what if there is,

1939
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:29,650
if the paradox part is like,
if you're telling me that intelligence 

1940
01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:30,260
is commented,
evolves everywhere,

1941
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:32,240
then why don't I see it already.
Right?

1942
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:33,620
So the,
the,

1943
01:09:33,621 --> 01:09:36,150
if you're asking about like why don't we
see signals from that,

1944
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:37,220
I've already answered that,
right?

1945
01:09:37,221 --> 01:09:39,340
Because we just,
we haven't looked yet so yet,

1946
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:42,530
but hit part of his question and this 
was done by a guy in heart.

1947
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:43,610
I mean,
so for me it was just,

1948
01:09:43,611 --> 01:09:45,800
this happened over a conversation in,
for lunch,

1949
01:09:45,801 --> 01:09:46,630
you know,
in 1950.

1950
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:49,400
So he just posed the,
he said where are they all?

1951
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:54,670
But in 1975 guy named Hart wrote a paper
where he really mapped out the here's 

1952
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:58,361
the main problem.
Even if you're traveling with a 10th of 

1953
01:09:58,361 --> 01:09:59,000
the speed of light,
if you managed to build like world ships

1954
01:09:59,001 --> 01:10:01,010
that can travel across the stars,
you know,

1955
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:04,940
and you're traveling at point one 
percent of the speed of light in,

1956
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:10,210
you know,
if you do that and you hop from one 

1957
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:10,210
store to the other,
build another ship,

1958
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:10,640
hop to the next one in about 600,000
years.

1959
01:10:10,641 --> 01:10:12,590
You have covered the whole galaxy,
right?

1960
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:13,580
So 600,000
years.

1961
01:10:13,581 --> 01:10:18,581
Sounds like a long time,
but it's a tiny part of the galaxies 

1962
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:18,581
history,
galaxies,

1963
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:19,190
10 billion years old.
So in that case,

1964
01:10:19,191 --> 01:10:24,191
like why every,
if just one species has to do that and 

1965
01:10:24,321 --> 01:10:25,280
they can cover the galaxy.

1966
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,040
So why aren't they?
Why don't we see the colony ships here?

1967
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:28,820
Right?
That's,

1968
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:33,050
that's a much harder version of the 
fermi paradox to get around.

1969
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:35,450
Is it though,
because if we did.

1970
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,700
Look,
we're already sending robots to Mars,

1971
01:10:37,730 --> 01:10:39,170
right?
We're not going to Mars yet,

1972
01:10:39,171 --> 01:10:44,171
but we're sending robots there.
What if we decide that there's no real 

1973
01:10:44,171 --> 01:10:47,531
benefit in sending biological entities 
into space and that the dangers of 

1974
01:10:47,531 --> 01:10:50,180
radiation and asteroidal impacts on this
is just too great.

1975
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:52,700
It's far better to send something.
I mean,

1976
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:57,620
look at what we're capable of doing now 
in terms of projection of video.

1977
01:10:57,950 --> 01:11:02,950
We can take a cell phone video and you 
could send it to your friend in New 

1978
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:06,730
Zealand and they can get it almost 
instantaneously to go to do a skype call

1979
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:11,930
where we can get some sort of three d,
virtual reality imaging of these planets

1980
01:11:12,591 --> 01:11:12,890
like,
Hey,

1981
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:15,480
do you want to see what it's like on 
Pandora here?

1982
01:11:15,481 --> 01:11:20,481
Put these goggles on and you will go 
wherever you want that robot to go and 

1983
01:11:20,521 --> 01:11:21,820
you'll be there.
Right?

1984
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:26,840
And maybe it'll get to the point where 
you can actually smell it and touch it 

1985
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:30,171
and feel it and,
but not be compromised by its 

1986
01:11:30,171 --> 01:11:30,171
environment in terms of your bio.

1987
01:11:30,171 --> 01:11:34,130
Well that's actually a huge point.
So that's one of the things we're 

1988
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:34,130
looking at in this paper is the idea 
that,

1989
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:34,170
you know,
good planets may be hard to find.

1990
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:39,200
You know,
there's this great novel by Kim Stanley 

1991
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:39,200
Robinson who's like,
just for me,

1992
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,230
one of the great science fiction 
writers,

1993
01:11:40,231 --> 01:11:42,760
it's called Aurora and then you know,
the usual worldship thing go.

1994
01:11:42,761 --> 01:11:47,761
So they build the colony ship,
it takes three generations to cross 

1995
01:11:47,761 --> 01:11:49,110
space and they get to the planet and the
planet socks,

1996
01:11:49,111 --> 01:11:51,090
it looked like it was going to be good,
you know,

1997
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:56,120
but there's like prions tiny or super 
small biological shit that just makes 

1998
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:56,850
you can't live there and then going 
back.

1999
01:11:56,851 --> 01:11:57,600
Right.
So it's like,

2000
01:11:57,810 --> 01:12:00,300
it may be exactly like you're saying 
that,

2001
01:12:00,301 --> 01:12:01,050
you know,
we think like,

2002
01:12:01,051 --> 01:12:02,070
oh,
you just land on a planet,

2003
01:12:02,071 --> 01:12:07,071
your terraform it and you know,
you just turned it into a habitable and 

2004
01:12:07,071 --> 01:12:07,071
it's like,
that may not work and maybe it does,

2005
01:12:07,071 --> 01:12:07,800
but that's a science fiction.
I do.

2006
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:09,120
So,
uh,

2007
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:11,250
right.
It's entirely possible.

2008
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,110
I mean,
there's a lot of possible solutions is,

2009
01:12:13,111 --> 01:12:14,190
which is just that,
uh,

2010
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:16,620
you know,
one of which is space is really hard and

2011
01:12:16,621 --> 01:12:18,810
really interstellar,
not interplanetary,

2012
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:21,930
but interstellar travel is really hard 
and really expensive.

2013
01:12:21,931 --> 01:12:26,931
I was just reading the paper on this 
with a guy estimated that in order to 

2014
01:12:26,931 --> 01:12:26,931
get,
like,

2015
01:12:26,931 --> 01:12:30,050
say you wanted to have a thousand people
on a worldship to get to another star 

2016
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:31,560
that would take the economy that come 
need like a,

2017
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:34,650
I think was like 100,000
Earth economies

2018
01:12:34,790 --> 01:12:38,240
to build that Jeff Paizos are you 
listening time?

2019
01:12:38,241 --> 01:12:39,470
We're ready.
You might have,

2020
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:42,830
but it was just like it was so much,

2021
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:43,840
you know,
you.

2022
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:45,000
Unless you were.
He said,

2023
01:12:45,001 --> 01:12:47,770
you know what the conclusion he came to,
unless you were a multi planet species,

2024
01:12:47,771 --> 01:12:48,460
if you were like,
uh,

2025
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,400
if you had conquered the entire um,
uh,

2026
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:54,520
or settled the entire solar system,
maybe you'd have an economy that big.

2027
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:59,700
So one,
one possible solution is good planets 

2028
01:12:59,700 --> 01:12:59,700
are hard to find.
And um,

2029
01:12:59,700 --> 01:12:59,920
and uh,
you know,

2030
01:12:59,921 --> 01:13:02,320
it's just too expensive.
It really costs a lot.

2031
01:13:02,321 --> 01:13:05,350
And so yeah,
it's not really worth the effort.

2032
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:10,360
You know,
you send out some probes once in a 

2033
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:10,360
while,
but yeah,

2034
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:10,360
no,
it's not.

2035
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:13,980
Well,
it's also finding an environment that's 

2036
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:15,160
not just habitable but stable in our 
environment is habitable.

2037
01:13:15,161 --> 01:13:17,560
But look what's going on in Hawaii right
now.

2038
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:21,760
There is a 400 year old lake that 
evaporated in a matter of hours,

2039
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,160
right?
It's the biggest lake on the big island.

2040
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:26,740
It's gone.
Which is such a tragedy,

2041
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:28,270
but it's not.
It's not.

2042
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:29,890
It's magnificent.
Right?

2043
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:33,100
And you watch that lava roll into that 
lake and say that's a wrap.

2044
01:13:33,101 --> 01:13:38,101
Kids no more lakey flux.
And it really shows you the power of a 

2045
01:13:38,101 --> 01:13:40,870
planet to that sources at work.
What makes continents?

2046
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:43,030
I mean it made the island in the first 
place.

2047
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:44,920
You can't be upset at it.
Billowing off.

2048
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:48,580
It is what made the island right.
It's continuing to make the island here,

2049
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:49,150
right?
Yeah.

2050
01:13:49,151 --> 01:13:49,840
Right,
exactly.

2051
01:13:49,841 --> 01:13:52,150
That's right about your house.
But now you've got more real estate.

2052
01:13:52,150 --> 01:13:57,150
So shout out.
It's making the island bigger and it's 

2053
01:13:57,150 --> 01:13:59,311
always done that.
It's been doing that for millions of 

2054
01:13:59,311 --> 01:13:59,311
years.
It's a fascinating place.

2055
01:13:59,311 --> 01:14:00,540
If you've been.
I've been and I've seen the.

2056
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:03,490
I want you to do the work.
Did you do the helicopter thing?

2057
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,600
No,
man,

2058
01:14:04,601 --> 01:14:09,601
you got to do the helicopter thing.
It's crazy because you fly over the 

2059
01:14:09,601 --> 01:14:09,910
volcanoes.
We can't now because it's too crazy,

2060
01:14:09,911 --> 01:14:12,370
but I did a few back and you could watch
it.

2061
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:16,570
The lava go into the ocean and you see 
these lava events.

2062
01:14:16,571 --> 01:14:21,520
Poor is red hot fucking.
It's like,

2063
01:14:21,521 --> 01:14:26,521
it's glowing.
It's going into the ocean that I saw 

2064
01:14:26,521 --> 01:14:26,521
that part.
We went to the park to see it,

2065
01:14:26,521 --> 01:14:27,940
you know,
and then when you went to,

2066
01:14:27,941 --> 01:14:32,941
when you go to that volcano park,
there's just like vince were steams 

2067
01:14:32,941 --> 01:14:32,941
coming out like New York City with the,
you know,

2068
01:14:32,941 --> 01:14:33,700
the manholes.

2069
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:38,700
You're like,
that's just from this heat coming in 

2070
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:40,660
from the bottom of the planet.
Are you scared about yellowstone?

2071
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:42,210
Uh,
like the uh,

2072
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:44,360
what was that movie?
A 2012 map.

2073
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,470
Like where did that.
Because that's such a.

2074
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,550
that's like a,
that's what made the adirondacks right.

2075
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:54,030
What was the 2012 movie?
I never saw that with ge Qa after 

2076
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:54,030
tomorrow.
Day.

2077
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:54,210
Before tomorrow.
No,

2078
01:14:54,211 --> 01:14:54,830
no,
no,

2079
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:55,530
no.
It was a,

2080
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:57,730
it was a climate change.
It was John cusack.

2081
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,070
It's actually a pretty good movie.
Yeah.

2082
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,420
That's another,
like destroy the plant.

2083
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:01,660
Those guys who made that.
Hold on,

2084
01:15:01,661 --> 01:15:03,340
stop right there.
That was not a pretty good movie.

2085
01:15:03,341 --> 01:15:04,840
That movie sucked.
Thought it was good.

2086
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:08,990
I'm moving so stupid,
stupid mistake.

2087
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:13,120
Disaster by inches with the cars.
They never got a flat.

2088
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:15,970
They always got away from the.
The world caving in.

2089
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:17,190
Totally believable,
man.

2090
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:20,260
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2091
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:21,070
No,
I thought.

2092
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:22,990
Well,
yellowstone is a caldera.

2093
01:15:22,991 --> 01:15:27,991
It's a super volcano and they're 
experiencing thousands of earthquakes a 

2094
01:15:27,991 --> 01:15:30,640
year and that eventually every six to 
800,000

2095
01:15:30,641 --> 01:15:31,810
years.
It's a continent killer.

2096
01:15:31,811 --> 01:15:33,940
The last time it blew was 600,000
years ago.

2097
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,130
So why aren't you scared?
Uh,

2098
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:37,140
I don't know,
I just don't think about it.

2099
01:15:37,190 --> 01:15:39,060
I'm fucking thinking about it every day,
man.

2100
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:44,070
I'll smoke a joint.
I think about once a month I think 

2101
01:15:44,070 --> 01:15:44,070
about,
you know,

2102
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:44,920
I should.
Okay.

2103
01:15:44,921 --> 01:15:46,030
I'm gonna.
Add that to my list of things.

2104
01:15:46,031 --> 01:15:51,031
I'm freaking out about it.
I have friends in Australia and that's 

2105
01:15:51,031 --> 01:15:51,031
where I'm going because there's light 
over.

2106
01:15:51,031 --> 01:15:51,820
Just start driving on the left hand 
side.

2107
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:55,630
That's the only thing you can go to.
I worried more about Seattle.

2108
01:15:55,631 --> 01:16:00,631
I lived in Seattle for a while and they 
said the super earthquake that they're 

2109
01:16:00,631 --> 01:16:03,631
looking at it,
it's going to turn the whole thing into 

2110
01:16:03,631 --> 01:16:03,631
Jello.

2111
01:16:03,631 --> 01:16:05,400
Right.
You get an earthquake so bad that the 

2112
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:05,400
ground just literally becomes porous.
Is it really that scary?

2113
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:05,800
They're,
yeah,

2114
01:16:05,801 --> 01:16:06,750
they're predicting because,
you know,

2115
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:07,870
Seattle's got like,
I mean,

2116
01:16:07,871 --> 01:16:09,180
I don't know that much about this.
I'm way out of my.

2117
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:11,620
I'm in the danger zone.
Um,

2118
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:13,810
the plates are super deep,
you know,

2119
01:16:13,811 --> 01:16:16,680
so you don't get as many tremors but,
but you know,

2120
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:21,740
when it releases,
it's gonna be a super powerful 

2121
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:22,150
earthquake and you know,
it'll,

2122
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,400
it'll be so powerful.
Yeah.

2123
01:16:23,401 --> 01:16:25,330
That they said that like there's not 
going to be even,

2124
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:30,450
even with the earthquake,
proofing is not gonna be be left 

2125
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:30,450
standing.
Jesus.

2126
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:30,650
So yeah,
dad,

2127
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:32,800
Seattle,
you must be,

2128
01:16:32,801 --> 01:16:33,640
I mean,
because you're here,

2129
01:16:33,641 --> 01:16:34,540
right?
You feel tremors.

2130
01:16:34,541 --> 01:16:35,800
They might say they happen all the time.
Right.

2131
01:16:35,801 --> 01:16:40,801
I've only been a few times,
but not all the time I've felt them 

2132
01:16:40,801 --> 01:16:40,801
before.

2133
01:16:40,801 --> 01:16:43,890
The,
the biggest ones I ever felt was when I 

2134
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:43,890
first moved here.
I first moved here in [inaudible] 94 and

2135
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:45,340
it was right after the northridge 
earthquake and uh,

2136
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:47,170
I was in my house and I felt,
uh,

2137
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:51,090
I guess it was like a five point five 
where the whole thing just,

2138
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:58,080
it was weird,
but it gave me the impression that the 

2139
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,321
house that I was living in or the 
apartment that I was in was made out of 

2140
01:17:01,321 --> 01:17:04,831
the same stuff,
like a box that a refrigerator would 

2141
01:17:04,831 --> 01:17:06,730
come in,
you can move it around inside.

2142
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:09,830
The whole thing was just moving like 
easily and right.

2143
01:17:09,831 --> 01:17:10,100
I was like,

2144
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,600
Holy Shit.
That was my.

2145
01:17:11,601 --> 01:17:13,680
I've only had a few times that I've felt
like I'm like,

2146
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:15,010
it's like it's,
you know,

2147
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:17,270
at first I thought it was a truck.
I thought the truck was rolling by,

2148
01:17:17,610 --> 01:17:18,590
you know,
and I'm like,

2149
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:19,030
oh,
somebody says,

2150
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:19,940
no man,
that was an earthquake.

2151
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:22,370
And the one that I experienced was 
nothing.

2152
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:27,520
I mean,
there's a baby one ones that they're 

2153
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:27,520
getting,
you know,

2154
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:28,040
right now,
somewhere in the world.

2155
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:33,041
I mean there's,
there's always something that's like a 

2156
01:17:33,041 --> 01:17:33,041
five or six.
Yeah.

2157
01:17:33,041 --> 01:17:33,500
So this goes back to your point about 
the,

2158
01:17:33,501 --> 01:17:33,980
uh,
you know,

2159
01:17:33,981 --> 01:17:34,760
a lot of planets,
right?

2160
01:17:34,761 --> 01:17:39,750
We'll be like way more plate 
tectonically active volatile than ours.

2161
01:17:39,751 --> 01:17:40,320
So,
you know,

2162
01:17:40,321 --> 01:17:45,321
I mean a lot of times and I think good 
planets are going to be really hard to 

2163
01:17:45,321 --> 01:17:45,321
find.
So,

2164
01:17:45,321 --> 01:17:45,920
you know,
it may be,

2165
01:17:45,921 --> 01:17:46,910
that may be the solution.

2166
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:48,680
The other solution is,
you know,

2167
01:17:48,681 --> 01:17:50,700
I mean,
the way you guys found out about me,

2168
01:17:50,701 --> 01:17:53,690
so I did that article about the previous
civilization,

2169
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:54,400
you know,
like what is it,

2170
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:56,070
how do you know whether or not there was
a previous civilization?

2171
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:57,830
And uh,
you know,

2172
01:17:57,831 --> 01:17:59,900
um,
one solution could be that,

2173
01:17:59,901 --> 01:18:01,310
look they were here,
you know,

2174
01:18:01,311 --> 01:18:03,740
that somebody did arrive and spend some 
time on earth,

2175
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:06,710
but if it was like half a billion years 
ago and they only lasted,

2176
01:18:06,711 --> 01:18:11,711
right?
Every civilization has a finite 

2177
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:11,711
lifetime.
They only lasted for,

2178
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:11,870
you know,
even a few hundred thousand years.

2179
01:18:11,871 --> 01:18:13,570
They wouldn't leave.
There'd be no record left to,

2180
01:18:13,571 --> 01:18:14,870
it'd be nothing,
there'd be nothing.

2181
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:17,600
Do you think that's possible that 
something's ever visited here?

2182
01:18:17,650 --> 01:18:19,760
And because that is the big question and
that's the,

2183
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:25,270
the,
the thing that gets the UFO dorks more 

2184
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:26,000
jazzed up than anything is the 
possibility that we'd been visited.

2185
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:26,840
Yeah.
Not In the.

2186
01:18:26,841 --> 01:18:28,800
I'm definitely not UFOS.
There's,

2187
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:31,110
there's two arguments against you if 
owes a.

2188
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:32,910
One is as,
as you know,

2189
01:18:32,990 --> 01:18:34,160
a friend of mine,
Jason Wright says,

2190
01:18:34,161 --> 01:18:35,240
it's like,
look as astronomers,

2191
01:18:35,241 --> 01:18:37,130
man,
we were finding all those aspects.

2192
01:18:37,131 --> 01:18:39,140
We're finding a little chunks of rock 
movement.

2193
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:44,180
You know,
nobody looks at the sky harder than we 

2194
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:44,180
do.
Right.

2195
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:44,180
And you know,
if anything,

2196
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:45,800
unless you want to go to the conspiracy 
theories,

2197
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:48,320
we would've found something.
My other argument is like,

2198
01:18:48,321 --> 01:18:49,820
what's with the headlights?
You know what I mean?

2199
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:50,630
People always like,
Oh man,

2200
01:18:50,631 --> 01:18:52,490
I saw lights in the sky.
And then they moved around and then they

2201
01:18:52,491 --> 01:18:53,120
disappeared,
you know,

2202
01:18:53,121 --> 01:18:55,220
but they don't really want to be seen.
I'm like,

2203
01:18:55,221 --> 01:18:56,600
well,
why do they have headlights on?

2204
01:18:56,601 --> 01:18:58,130
Like why just turn off the fricking 
nights.

2205
01:18:58,131 --> 01:19:03,131
It just.
Why would they have lights in the first 

2206
01:19:03,131 --> 01:19:03,131
place?

2207
01:19:03,131 --> 01:19:06,020
You came from another civilization and 
you can't get around without your high 

2208
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:08,651
beams.
You know the ideas like what the fuck 

2209
01:19:08,651 --> 01:19:08,651
are you seeing?
What those lights,

2210
01:19:08,651 --> 01:19:08,900
right?
You're not seeing shit.

2211
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:12,530
That was the last time you saw me.
Planes have lights so other planes don't

2212
01:19:12,531 --> 01:19:17,531
run into them.
They don't have the light so they could 

2213
01:19:17,531 --> 01:19:17,531
see where they're going.
Yeah.

2214
01:19:17,531 --> 01:19:17,531
So what.
So why do they have.

2215
01:19:17,531 --> 01:19:17,531
Right,
exactly.

2216
01:19:17,531 --> 01:19:18,870
The planes have lights so other people 
can seem.

2217
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:23,890
So they're here but they're mysterious.
They don't want to be found in turn off 

2218
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:23,890
the fricking light.
So they.

2219
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:24,260
Yeah,
they wouldn't have any lines,

2220
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:25,520
but yeah,
they always have lights.

2221
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:27,230
Yeah.
People are always seeing,

2222
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:32,250
like eliminate.
I liked this guy and then they moved 

2223
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:33,751
back and forth.
And so also the problem with human 

2224
01:19:33,751 --> 01:19:36,611
memory.
Memory's horrible memory of events that 

2225
01:19:36,611 --> 01:19:39,680
are stunning or shocking or unnerving or
you think you saw something,

2226
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:39,940
right?

2227
01:19:39,950 --> 01:19:41,480
They've done all that research even in 
trials,

2228
01:19:41,481 --> 01:19:43,090
right?
Where people see things,

2229
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:45,560
you know,
just kinda like.

2230
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:49,670
But do you think it's possible that 
there could be life on other planets and

2231
01:19:49,671 --> 01:19:53,150
it's possible there could be intelligent
life on other planets and we send probes

2232
01:19:53,151 --> 01:19:54,450
to Mars,
why wouldn't.

2233
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:57,230
And I think that if they do send 
something here,

2234
01:19:57,231 --> 01:19:59,810
they're going to send something without 
biological life inside of it.

2235
01:19:59,811 --> 01:20:00,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

2236
01:20:00,231 --> 01:20:00,610
Well,
this is,

2237
01:20:00,650 --> 01:20:05,650
you know,
it's a really interesting question is 

2238
01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:05,650
like you were talking about like what 
will we evolve into in,

2239
01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:05,650
you know,
a million years,

2240
01:20:05,810 --> 01:20:06,260
uh,
you know,

2241
01:20:06,261 --> 01:20:07,980
it may be possible that biology is

2242
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:12,980
a short period of intelligence.
You build machines and the machines 

2243
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:13,610
become,
you know,

2244
01:20:13,870 --> 01:20:15,510
you download yourself into.
I mean,

2245
01:20:15,511 --> 01:20:17,310
that's a real possibility that like,
you know,

2246
01:20:17,311 --> 01:20:20,610
silicon makes a lot more sense than 
wetware.

2247
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:25,760
Well,
the problem is we think of artificial 

2248
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:25,760
intelligence as artificial,
right?

2249
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,030
It's definitely real,
right?

2250
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:26,460
Yeah.
No,

2251
01:20:26,461 --> 01:20:27,570
that's exactly.
It's not,

2252
01:20:27,690 --> 01:20:29,640
it's not fake.
It's right there.

2253
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,860
You know,
it's like there's artificial milk,

2254
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:33,780
you know what I mean?
But it's,

2255
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:35,850
it's a liquid,
it's an actual liquid.

2256
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,530
There's not an artificial life.
It's just silicon created life.

2257
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:42,060
But again,
the idea of the biosphere,

2258
01:20:42,061 --> 01:20:47,061
this may be the what the biosphere 
solution to spreading itself to getting 

2259
01:20:47,061 --> 01:20:47,600
it maybe that,
like silicon,

2260
01:20:47,670 --> 01:20:52,670
that that's kind of a normal face.
I am super skeptical about the whole 

2261
01:20:53,911 --> 01:20:56,620
trans human thing that we're going to 
download ourselves and do intelligent.

2262
01:20:56,630 --> 01:21:01,630
You don't.
Have you ever gone to one of those 

2263
01:21:01,630 --> 01:21:01,630
conventions,
knows dorks.

2264
01:21:01,630 --> 01:21:02,600
There's some pretty serious dork in.
Well,

2265
01:21:02,610 --> 01:21:05,520
there's geniuses in those dorks too.
It's really interesting.

2266
01:21:05,521 --> 01:21:10,521
It's like they're fully wholly committed
to this prospect of downloading 

2267
01:21:10,521 --> 01:21:11,080
themselves.
You've talked Kurtzweil before.

2268
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:11,760
Uh,
no,

2269
01:21:11,761 --> 01:21:16,761
but I've read his stuff.
I had a chance to interview him a few 

2270
01:21:16,761 --> 01:21:17,790
years back for smart,
but he's just like beyond smart,

2271
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:20,790
but God damn is he committed to it.
And then when you get to it,

2272
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:25,050
you realize that what he actually wants 
to do is recreate his father.

2273
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:31,100
Yeah.
He's his father died when he was young 

2274
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:34,430
and he wants to be able to through 
memories and photographs and what he 

2275
01:21:34,501 --> 01:21:39,501
knows about his father,
literally recreate his father and to be 

2276
01:21:39,501 --> 01:21:41,610
able to have a conversation with them.
He was talking about this.

2277
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:45,720
Right?
But what he's doing is he's going way,

2278
01:21:45,721 --> 01:21:50,721
way into the future,
into the possibilities of he's not 

2279
01:21:50,721 --> 01:21:50,721
seeing like,
well,

2280
01:21:50,721 --> 01:21:52,410
five years from now we're going to be 
able to send,

2281
01:21:52,411 --> 01:21:54,590
you know,
gigabyte pictures to them,

2282
01:21:54,591 --> 01:21:59,591
you know,
he's saying let's think of if you keep 

2283
01:21:59,591 --> 01:22:03,141
going exponentially and the electronics 
and technology and innovation keeps 

2284
01:22:03,141 --> 01:22:03,630
continually accelerating.

2285
01:22:03,930 --> 01:22:08,490
We could potentially get to the point 
where it's the impossible.

2286
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:13,640
Well,
you'd be able to recreate human beings 

2287
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:16,581
based on your knowledge of them and then
they'll be able to come up with some 

2288
01:22:16,581 --> 01:22:20,091
sort of a program.
Will he'll be able to have a 

2289
01:22:20,091 --> 01:22:20,091
conversation with his father.
Yeah.

2290
01:22:20,091 --> 01:22:20,091
See,
I think that misunder.

2291
01:22:20,091 --> 01:22:20,091
I mean,
I think it's,

2292
01:22:20,091 --> 01:22:20,660
you know,
it's true,

2293
01:22:20,661 --> 01:22:25,661
but like the possibility of a 
singularity and technological 

2294
01:22:25,661 --> 01:22:25,661
development,
but you know,

2295
01:22:25,661 --> 01:22:27,510
it's not going to be his father.
That's the sad thing.

2296
01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:29,450
You know,
I think we seriously,

2297
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,800
I've done some work on this as an 
interest of mine about mind.

2298
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:34,560
What is mind and what's the relationship
between mind and matter?

2299
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:39,860
And um,
I think we have like a serious 

2300
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:42,141
misunderstood.
We don't understand consciousness very 

2301
01:22:42,141 --> 01:22:42,141
well at all.
So the idea that like,

2302
01:22:42,141 --> 01:22:46,611
oh yeah,
it's just got to be trivial to download 

2303
01:22:46,611 --> 01:22:46,611
your,
you know,

2304
01:22:46,611 --> 01:22:46,611
your consciousness into a computer.

2305
01:22:46,611 --> 01:22:47,040
I think it's pretty,
you know,

2306
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:51,120
there's like a shit load of assumptions 
in there about like what mind is and the

2307
01:22:51,121 --> 01:22:54,480
relationship between your neurons and 
you know,

2308
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:56,640
awareness.
So that's why I think those guys,

2309
01:22:56,641 --> 01:22:58,350
it's a little bit of a religion,
you know what I mean?

2310
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:00,790
It is a little bit,
you know,

2311
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,370
so it's like,
well 20,

2312
01:23:02,371 --> 01:23:05,560
45 is the new benchmark for whatever 
reason,

2313
01:23:05,561 --> 01:23:07,510
that's the new number.
They keep going back.

2314
01:23:07,511 --> 01:23:10,210
It's gonna be like every other,
every other rapture.

2315
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:11,380
We thought it was 20,
45.

2316
01:23:11,381 --> 01:23:13,900
We really been 20 slash 65.
We went to this 20,

2317
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:18,910
45 conference,
me and my friend Ran Duncan and we got 

2318
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:21,691
to talk to some of these guys and it's 
really fascinating and one of them had 

2319
01:23:21,691 --> 01:23:25,930
created some robot that was supposed to 
be him but it didn't work well.

2320
01:23:25,931 --> 01:23:28,990
So they never revealed that at the 
conference that had too many bugs in it.

2321
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:35,130
It's intriguing.
It's like I want them to keep going 

2322
01:23:35,130 --> 01:23:35,130
because I mean,
when,

2323
01:23:35,130 --> 01:23:38,731
when are we going to get to x Mokena?
When are we going to get to talk about 

2324
01:23:38,731 --> 01:23:38,800
good movies?
Or did you like that?

2325
01:23:38,801 --> 01:23:40,810
One of my favorite movies ever.
So smart.

2326
01:23:40,811 --> 01:23:42,130
So like,
just like simple.

2327
01:23:42,131 --> 01:23:43,960
He's not beating you over the head with 
it and know,

2328
01:23:43,961 --> 01:23:46,050
cut the shit most moving moments in that
movie.

2329
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,740
You were like,
whoa.

2330
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:51,460
The entire.
I think that's one of my all time top 20

2331
01:23:51,461 --> 01:23:53,410
movies,
which he stabs him just emotionless.

2332
01:23:53,411 --> 01:23:54,670
Just family.
I'm putting the blade in.

2333
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:57,060
It was amazing.
Amazing alert.

2334
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:03,660
Did you like annihilation?
Because I didn't like it as much but I 

2335
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:08,611
liked it.
It was very weird and the ending seemed 

2336
01:24:08,611 --> 01:24:10,230
like some producers put their just in 
the soup just like Pittsburgh,

2337
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:12,850
what's happening here?
Who made this part?

2338
01:24:12,870 --> 01:24:13,080
Yeah.

2339
01:24:13,470 --> 01:24:14,570
Uh,
but I,

2340
01:24:14,571 --> 01:24:16,780
I enjoyed it.
So I think like,

2341
01:24:16,781 --> 01:24:21,781
you know,
the danger with anything when it comes 

2342
01:24:21,781 --> 01:24:21,781
to ai.
And so when you.

2343
01:24:21,781 --> 01:24:22,060
Here's an interesting thing about ai,
like we're,

2344
01:24:22,070 --> 01:24:25,320
we are getting,
making amazing strides with ai now.

2345
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:28,180
Now artificial intelligence is different
from artificial consciousness.

2346
01:24:28,181 --> 01:24:28,760
You know what I mean?
So,

2347
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:31,550
but um,
but the ai that,

2348
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:36,560
you know,
what we're getting out of it is nothing 

2349
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:36,560
like us,
right?

2350
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:36,560
So the,
you know,

2351
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:36,580
back in the day where people were like,
oh,

2352
01:24:36,581 --> 01:24:39,370
we're going to model the human brain and
that's how we'll do it.

2353
01:24:39,371 --> 01:24:44,371
Well,
like programs that are what and what 

2354
01:24:44,371 --> 01:24:44,371
they've learned is like,
ah,

2355
01:24:44,371 --> 01:24:45,190
that doesn't really work that well.
So now this whole big data thing like,

2356
01:24:45,191 --> 01:24:50,191
you know,
network theory and big data and deep 

2357
01:24:50,191 --> 01:24:50,191
learning,
we're like,

2358
01:24:50,191 --> 01:24:50,191
you know,
they're using statistical,

2359
01:24:50,191 --> 01:24:50,980
you know,
the power of,

2360
01:24:50,981 --> 01:24:55,540
of having huge amounts of computing and 
statistical reasoning so that like,

2361
01:24:55,570 --> 01:24:56,500
you know,
get the computer,

2362
01:24:56,501 --> 01:24:56,840
like,
you know,

2363
01:24:56,860 --> 01:25:01,860
it'll find the picture of the cat,
but you have no idea why it found that 

2364
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:02,470
it didn't reason like,
oh yeah,

2365
01:25:02,471 --> 01:25:03,990
that was sort of looks like cat and I 
like cats,

2366
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:04,780
you know,
it was just like,

2367
01:25:04,781 --> 01:25:09,781
oh,
these kinds of lines go with that kind 

2368
01:25:09,781 --> 01:25:09,781
of thing and it has no idea what it's 
doing,

2369
01:25:09,781 --> 01:25:10,300
but it'll act intelligently.

2370
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:12,190
And so that's,
you know,

2371
01:25:12,191 --> 01:25:14,890
I mean that's kind of freaky deaky in a 
lot of ways too.

2372
01:25:14,891 --> 01:25:19,891
I think people are,
I think it's smart to think about the 

2373
01:25:19,891 --> 01:25:23,311
dangers of Ai.
Not necessarily want to take some 

2374
01:25:23,311 --> 01:25:23,440
pictures to us.
Yeah.

2375
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:28,620
Not necessarily the dangers,
just the dangers to this thing that we 

2376
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:30,940
are this weird monkey thing that wants 
to keep being a monkey thing.

2377
01:25:31,570 --> 01:25:32,770
Well,
you mean in the sense of like,

2378
01:25:32,771 --> 01:25:34,210
right,
that it's going to replace us?

2379
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:35,070
Yes.
Yeah.

2380
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:36,280
Yeah.
I think it's inevitable.

2381
01:25:36,730 --> 01:25:41,730
I mean,
don't you think that if you go back and 

2382
01:25:41,730 --> 01:25:44,071
interview the single celled organism 
before branched off into multicell 

2383
01:25:44,330 --> 01:25:49,330
multicell bullshit.
I don't want to stay a single cell at 

2384
01:25:49,330 --> 01:25:53,281
the bottom of the rock and roll music 
and they're to mail cars.

2385
01:25:53,501 --> 01:25:55,510
Fuck that.
I don't want a car man.

2386
01:25:55,511 --> 01:25:59,260
I like stand down here.
There are some real thought to that,

2387
01:25:59,261 --> 01:26:02,230
that we are the wetware that is the 
problem.

2388
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:02,890
No,
no.

2389
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:03,310
Listen,
I,

2390
01:26:03,311 --> 01:26:06,350
I think it's fully conceivable,
like I'm not going do it.

2391
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:09,080
It'll never happen.
But as a guy knows,

2392
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:10,010
a philosopher says,
you know,

2393
01:26:10,011 --> 01:26:12,620
there's a certain way in which 
everything we do with ai right now,

2394
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:14,030
it's not like,
you know,

2395
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:19,060
Watson is playing chess.
It's like we're using Watson to play 

2396
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:19,280
chess.
It's our tool,

2397
01:26:19,310 --> 01:26:22,350
you know,
and I think the fear is the toolkits add

2398
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:27,360
a hand,
not that it develops a thing where like 

2399
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:27,360
I hated humans,
you know,

2400
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:27,360
dad,
I hate you,

2401
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:28,230
but more that it's like,
you know,

2402
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:30,680
these things which are not actually 
thinking,

2403
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:33,260
they act intelligent but they're not 
thinking can have a huge.

2404
01:26:33,261 --> 01:26:35,100
Like it'll have a really negative 
impact,

2405
01:26:35,110 --> 01:26:35,420
you know,
it'll,

2406
01:26:35,510 --> 01:26:36,230
it'll,
you know,

2407
01:26:36,231 --> 01:26:37,430
what does it,
there's that example of like,

2408
01:26:37,431 --> 01:26:40,310
if you design something that is an ai 
system to make paperclips,

2409
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:45,460
it ends up consuming the entire planet 
making paperclips because that's what 

2410
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:45,460
you told it to do.

2411
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:49,500
Right.
You never told it to make a sustainable 

2412
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:49,500
amount of.
Right.

2413
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:49,500
Exactly.
So I'm,

2414
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:50,400
I'm more worried about that than I am of
like Sky Net,

2415
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:51,980
you know,
coming over and like,

2416
01:26:51,981 --> 01:26:56,981
you know,
deciding that it's going to take a drop 

2417
01:26:56,981 --> 01:26:56,981
all the bombs on it because it needs to 
get rid of it.

2418
01:26:56,981 --> 01:27:00,490
Well there's no biological imperative 
for a silicon based artificial 

2419
01:27:00,561 --> 01:27:03,350
intelligence to procreate to keep going 
and move forward.

2420
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:08,351
Like why do they do that?
You do it because we came from biology.

2421
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:12,470
Biology needs to stay alive and 
everybody wants bigger,

2422
01:27:12,471 --> 01:27:13,790
faster,
stronger.

2423
01:27:13,791 --> 01:27:18,791
You want to keep moving and it's because
there's a real possibility that you 

2424
01:27:18,791 --> 01:27:19,700
might get consumed by some other life 
form.

2425
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:24,940
So you have to protect yourself and you 
have to look out for other people who 

2426
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:28,220
might want to breed with the viable 
female that you've copulated with.

2427
01:27:28,450 --> 01:27:32,150
There's a lot of shit going on built in 
evolutionarily to have.

2428
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:37,460
But we assume that somehow or another 
these artificial creations will have as 

2429
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:38,060
well,
which is why,

2430
01:27:38,090 --> 01:27:39,050
right?
I mean yeah,

2431
01:27:39,051 --> 01:27:42,500
like if we program it in.
So the thing is like,

2432
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:45,500
but will it wake up like so that if it 
does wake up,

2433
01:27:45,501 --> 01:27:48,410
will it have the inclination towards 
scientific research?

2434
01:27:48,411 --> 01:27:51,620
Would it even want to send something 
through the cosmos of us?

2435
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:52,270
Yeah.
No,

2436
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:53,470
that's a really interesting.
I,

2437
01:27:53,490 --> 01:27:58,490
you know,
and I think we just don't know if it 

2438
01:27:58,490 --> 01:27:58,490
actually because listen,
we,

2439
01:27:58,490 --> 01:28:01,510
we understand so little about what 
consciousness is and what its 

2440
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:01,510
imperatives are like.
Yeah.

2441
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:01,510
Once you wake up and you're like,
oh,

2442
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:02,810
you're dead,
you know,

2443
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,400
dad,
I got to see like why?

2444
01:28:04,401 --> 01:28:09,401
Like,
who knows what really did you like 

2445
01:28:09,401 --> 01:28:09,401
Battlestar Galactica?
I loved Battlestar.

2446
01:28:09,401 --> 01:28:11,400
God damn good.
Was that the new version?

2447
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:17,750
I love the old version because that I 
was 14 years old and spaceships,

2448
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:19,350
but the new version was amazing.

2449
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:24,520
Smart.
If there is a show that I wish they 

2450
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:24,730
would bring back,
it's Battlestar Galactica the ending.

2451
01:28:25,150 --> 01:28:26,900
But the ending though it was,
you know,

2452
01:28:26,901 --> 01:28:30,710
they had to end it is all right.
But the fucking series was brilliant.

2453
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:32,840
It was brilliant.
You know what was amazing about that?

2454
01:28:32,841 --> 01:28:37,841
The way they wrapped,
like all the political shit that was 

2455
01:28:37,841 --> 01:28:38,930
happening after nine slash 11 to that 
man from the torture scenes.

2456
01:28:39,770 --> 01:28:40,600
Yeah man,
it was so.

2457
01:28:40,601 --> 01:28:43,740
And then they even had the whole thing 
with starbuck about know what was she,

2458
01:28:44,730 --> 01:28:49,730
you know,
there's a couple of like it was five 

2459
01:28:49,730 --> 01:28:49,730
years.
Right.

2460
01:28:49,730 --> 01:28:49,730
And there were a couple of seasons where
like,

2461
01:28:49,730 --> 01:28:51,830
it Kinda got a little ran off the rails.
But what's her name?

2462
01:28:51,831 --> 01:28:53,300
Katie sackhoff.
Is that her name?

2463
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:54,700
Who?
Starbuck?

2464
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:55,820
Yeah.
Is that her name?

2465
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,410
Yeah,
she's so good.

2466
01:28:57,710 --> 01:29:02,710
She was really good in that role stuff 
since she's got a movie out right now on

2467
01:29:02,911 --> 01:29:03,510
Netflix.

2468
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:04,260
I haven't seen it.
Right.

2469
01:29:04,261 --> 01:29:04,950
But I'm saying like,
Oh yeah,

2470
01:29:04,951 --> 01:29:05,610
there's,
you know,

2471
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:07,070
but she had rights.
You sort of disappeared.

2472
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:09,930
It was so good in that show.
I was like,

2473
01:29:09,931 --> 01:29:12,630
well this is,
this is like the launching pad for her.

2474
01:29:12,650 --> 01:29:17,650
Yeah.
And you almost revolutionary about that 

2475
01:29:17,650 --> 01:29:17,650
show to the way they did the special 
effects were like,

2476
01:29:17,650 --> 01:29:17,880
oh,
the camera moved around.

2477
01:29:17,881 --> 01:29:18,940
Like there's a spaceship,
but um,

2478
01:29:18,941 --> 01:29:19,830
you know,
I don't have.

2479
01:29:20,070 --> 01:29:20,580
It.
Didn't do,

2480
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,350
you know,
sometimes it did those long pants,

2481
01:29:22,351 --> 01:29:24,960
but it was kind of opened up a whole new
way of sort of looking at,

2482
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:26,520
uh,
you know,

2483
01:29:26,521 --> 01:29:28,530
just sort of what it looks like to be in
space and stuff.

2484
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:33,550
Yeah.
But it really scared the shit out of 

2485
01:29:33,550 --> 01:29:34,941
people in terms of artificial life.
Something that we create the decides 

2486
01:29:34,941 --> 01:29:35,340
it's done with us and it's taking over.
Well,

2487
01:29:35,341 --> 01:29:36,270
you know,
what's amazing about that,

2488
01:29:36,271 --> 01:29:38,250
and this is I've written about this,
this idea that like,

2489
01:29:38,251 --> 01:29:39,810
you know,
we keep telling that story over and over

2490
01:29:39,811 --> 01:29:39,990
again.

2491
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:41,520
How many movies,
you know,

2492
01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:42,780
can you think of that,
have that.

2493
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:45,420
And I think like,
so I'm really interested in myth,

2494
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:45,840
right?
That,

2495
01:29:45,841 --> 01:29:47,550
you know,
the whole mythology,

2496
01:29:47,551 --> 01:29:48,230
the way like,
you know,

2497
01:29:48,270 --> 01:29:50,010
we can never get away from the myths,
you know,

2498
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:51,450
coming of age,
the hero's journey,

2499
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:53,070
Campbell,
Joseph Campbell,

2500
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:54,730
Joseph Campbell Fan.
Um,

2501
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:57,060
but like you know,
what's happening with us now,

2502
01:29:57,061 --> 01:29:58,020
we got,
there's nothing in,

2503
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:03,080
there's nothing in the storehouse of 
myth to take care of like building 

2504
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:03,480
machines that take over.
Right?

2505
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:08,600
So the reason we keep telling that story
over and over again is we're preparing 

2506
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:08,600
ourselves,
right?

2507
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:09,330
We're building the myths,
you know,

2508
01:30:09,331 --> 01:30:12,000
that sort of will help.
We don't know what's going to happen,

2509
01:30:12,001 --> 01:30:14,730
but we have to keep telling that story 
because we can feel it coming,

2510
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:16,250
you know what I mean,
like this is.

2511
01:30:16,251 --> 01:30:20,610
So we need to keep telling a story to 
kind of explore what the options are.

2512
01:30:20,730 --> 01:30:25,730
And I liked that too.
I liked about the ending and I didn't 

2513
01:30:25,730 --> 01:30:25,730
think the ending was great.
But the idea that like,

2514
01:30:25,730 --> 01:30:25,920
oh yeah,
this balance,

2515
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:30,921
you know,
you get to keep going through these 

2516
01:30:30,921 --> 01:30:30,921
cycles of trying to achieve this balance
between,

2517
01:30:30,921 --> 01:30:34,341
you know,
silicon forms and non silica and then 

2518
01:30:34,341 --> 01:30:34,341
biological forms.
But um,

2519
01:30:34,341 --> 01:30:38,430
well we have not,
we were worried that we're going to be 

2520
01:30:38,430 --> 01:30:41,091
taken over by something else,
but we're not overly concerned with 

2521
01:30:41,091 --> 01:30:44,541
evolving our own biology changing.
And maybe that's the solution in terms 

2522
01:30:44,881 --> 01:30:49,740
of our physical limitations is some sort
of a symbiotic connection between us and

2523
01:30:49,741 --> 01:30:54,741
technology.
That instead of artificial technology 

2524
01:30:54,741 --> 01:30:57,770
and artificial life taking over usurping
us instead of that maybe we become a 

2525
01:30:57,781 --> 01:31:00,030
part of it and it becomes a part of us 
and we.

2526
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:01,770
I mean,
you have glasses on,

2527
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:05,400
you can see better with those glasses.
That's essentially a Cyborg.

2528
01:31:05,420 --> 01:31:06,010
Yeah,
yeah,

2529
01:31:06,070 --> 01:31:06,480
yeah.
Right,

2530
01:31:06,660 --> 01:31:07,080
right,
right.

2531
01:31:07,081 --> 01:31:07,920
And these things,
you know,

2532
01:31:07,921 --> 01:31:09,040
these cell phones,
my God,

2533
01:31:09,070 --> 01:31:11,200
my memories in there,
right to no cell phones.

2534
01:31:11,670 --> 01:31:15,600
My house two days ago without my phone 
and I turned around in a panic on my own

2535
01:31:15,601 --> 01:31:17,600
street.
Where's my fucking.

2536
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,130
I was like,
no.

2537
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:21,090
You remember when you used to have phone
numbers in your head?

2538
01:31:21,210 --> 01:31:22,090
Oh yeah.

2539
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:25,950
My wife's number.
I can't.

2540
01:31:25,951 --> 01:31:28,660
Like I got three digits.
Adam go further than this crazy.

2541
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:33,030
But we remember a lot of other stuff 
now.

2542
01:31:33,330 --> 01:31:35,070
I mean,
you have so much.

2543
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:38,040
I mean I'm,
I'm really overwhelmed.

2544
01:31:38,041 --> 01:31:41,790
I think I'm in that weird zone where I 
just don't have,

2545
01:31:42,230 --> 01:31:44,760
I don't,
I don't have enough data space.

2546
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:47,070
I don't have enough storage for all of 
us.

2547
01:31:47,071 --> 01:31:48,420
That's.
You've got to kind of pick and choose,

2548
01:31:48,421 --> 01:31:50,610
right?
Sort of like wikipedia.

2549
01:31:50,611 --> 01:31:55,611
We're all human knowledge.
Entire sum of human knowledge is right 

2550
01:31:55,611 --> 01:31:55,611
there,
you know,

2551
01:31:55,611 --> 01:31:56,970
mean like,
Whoa,

2552
01:31:56,971 --> 01:31:58,710
what are you talking about?
Changes.

2553
01:31:58,711 --> 01:32:00,220
Right?
So you were talking about what

2554
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:02,440
an amazing change that you can have.
Pretty much,

2555
01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:03,790
you know,
like,

2556
01:32:04,050 --> 01:32:05,650
you know,
I love comics,

2557
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:06,150
right?
You know,

2558
01:32:06,151 --> 01:32:08,950
I was a comic marvel guy way back.
Right.

2559
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:10,360
And back in the day,
you know,

2560
01:32:10,361 --> 01:32:11,830
you paid for your,
you had to,

2561
01:32:11,831 --> 01:32:13,210
you know,
first of all you got your ass kicked.

2562
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:14,290
But um,
you know,

2563
01:32:14,291 --> 01:32:17,230
you have to go to the store every week 
and get the comics and you know,

2564
01:32:17,410 --> 01:32:20,140
and now you know,
you just look up captain America and you

2565
01:32:20,141 --> 01:32:21,370
can know everything.
There was about his,

2566
01:32:21,371 --> 01:32:22,720
you know,
his origin story and everything.

2567
01:32:22,770 --> 01:32:27,770
So it's like that idea that like there's
no domains of knowledge that you can't 

2568
01:32:27,770 --> 01:32:30,550
instantly access and have all the 
backstory that you need to be a physical

2569
01:32:30,551 --> 01:32:31,720
comic.
Books are amazing,

2570
01:32:31,721 --> 01:32:35,650
but I have to be honest,
comic books on an Ipad or better because

2571
01:32:35,651 --> 01:32:36,970
you don't see the next frame.

2572
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:37,650
Yeah,
yeah.

2573
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:41,080
You just swipe and then you get the next
frame.

2574
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:42,590
You don't,
you don't see it in advance.

2575
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:45,350
Like if you're reading the left side,
Dr.

2576
01:32:45,630 --> 01:32:48,040
Change and the right side is an 
explosion and you're like,

2577
01:32:48,041 --> 01:32:50,440
well I see that and see that shit's 
coming next.

2578
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:52,720
Like it's kind of a shitty way to do it.
No,

2579
01:32:52,721 --> 01:32:53,980
I agree.
I have an ipad.

2580
01:32:53,981 --> 01:32:55,360
It's fucking amazing.
Amazing.

2581
01:32:55,361 --> 01:32:55,660
Yeah.
No.

2582
01:32:55,690 --> 01:32:59,560
When you do that thing and now with the,
it's like embarrassing as a professor of

2583
01:32:59,561 --> 01:33:02,530
physics at a major university.
I have like $3,000

2584
01:33:02,580 --> 01:33:04,770
for the comic books.
Embarrassing.

2585
01:33:04,850 --> 01:33:08,230
It's not embarrassing.
Can't be still brilliant guy.

2586
01:33:08,231 --> 01:33:10,060
But he just also like cool shit.
Yeah.

2587
01:33:10,061 --> 01:33:12,190
Well shouldn't I be reading like those,
the Esky or something?

2588
01:33:12,191 --> 01:33:13,240
I don't know.
You fumble,

2589
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:13,930
you know,
my dad was,

2590
01:33:13,931 --> 01:33:16,380
my dad was always like,
because my dad was a writer,

2591
01:33:16,410 --> 01:33:17,710
a comic books,
you know,

2592
01:33:17,711 --> 01:33:18,220
but I was like,
Dad,

2593
01:33:18,221 --> 01:33:19,390
I've learned that especially with 
marvel,

2594
01:33:19,391 --> 01:33:19,600
right.

2595
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:20,860
Marvel a great language,
right?

2596
01:33:20,861 --> 01:33:23,650
I mean the word synopsis from Marvel,
you know,

2597
01:33:23,670 --> 01:33:24,930
so uh,
especially,

2598
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:27,490
you know,
some of the like doctor strange had some

2599
01:33:27,491 --> 01:33:28,780
great shit,
you know.

2600
01:33:28,781 --> 01:33:29,800
Fantastic.
Four.

2601
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:30,520
Yeah.
No,

2602
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:31,180
the doctors,
you know,

2603
01:33:31,181 --> 01:33:36,181
it's,
I was this the science advisor for 

2604
01:33:36,181 --> 01:33:36,181
doctor strange with,
for the movie,

2605
01:33:36,181 --> 01:33:36,181
for the movie?
Yeah,

2606
01:33:36,181 --> 01:33:39,910
it was best.
I always say,

2607
01:33:39,911 --> 01:33:41,630
I said you have to correct anything.
No,

2608
01:33:41,650 --> 01:33:43,030
no,
not really because they called me in.

2609
01:33:43,031 --> 01:33:48,031
So I know Scott Derrick's actually had 
lunch with or breakfast with Scott 

2610
01:33:48,031 --> 01:33:48,370
yesterday.
I know Scott from my first book,

2611
01:33:48,371 --> 01:33:49,760
which is about science and religion,
you know,

2612
01:33:49,770 --> 01:33:52,180
so you know,
we've got somebody connected us and we'd

2613
01:33:52,181 --> 01:33:55,690
been talking for a long time and when he
got tapped to do doctor strange,

2614
01:33:55,691 --> 01:33:57,490
he contacted,
I got the email,

2615
01:33:57,491 --> 01:33:59,120
said marvel wants to talk to you,
you know,

2616
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:02,150
it's like,
yeah,

2617
01:34:02,190 --> 01:34:04,330
I got out there for a day and met Kevin 
fee man.

2618
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:05,980
It was just like,
oh man.

2619
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:11,160
And so we basically worked on,
he wanted to work on to two things for 

2620
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:11,160
that.
And what's funny is I never read Dr.

2621
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:11,590
Strange,
right?

2622
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:14,590
Because I was like a science guy was all
about Tony Stark or you know,

2623
01:34:14,591 --> 01:34:17,890
or you know,
or a spiderman or the x men.

2624
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:18,790
So I never,
I was like,

2625
01:34:18,791 --> 01:34:21,630
Oh God uses magic.
So think we have to figure out was um,

2626
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:25,210
first of all that that scene where he 
first do the counters,

2627
01:34:25,211 --> 01:34:26,650
the ancient one,
you know,

2628
01:34:26,651 --> 01:34:28,020
and she has to kind of like,
you know,

2629
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:33,060
school him on,
there's more ways to think about the 

2630
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:33,280
world beyond science and then the,
the multiverse.

2631
01:34:33,310 --> 01:34:38,310
That was the other thing because I've 
written the blog a lot on the 

2632
01:34:38,310 --> 01:34:38,310
multiverse,
but man,

2633
01:34:38,310 --> 01:34:39,220
it was awesome.
It was so much fun to be in the writer's

2634
01:34:39,221 --> 01:34:40,080
room,
you know,

2635
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:42,010
with them and just like be throwing 
around ideas.

2636
01:34:42,130 --> 01:34:43,050
Wow.
Yeah.

2637
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:48,060
No it was.
And it'll probably never ever happen 

2638
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:48,060
again.
But I don't care.

2639
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:48,060
You know,
how to care.

2640
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:51,931
I got my shot.
That was a weird thing that when you're 

2641
01:34:51,931 --> 01:34:54,811
young you like all this cool stuff,
but then when you get old you're 

2642
01:34:54,811 --> 01:34:57,631
supposed to be more pragmatic.
You're supposed to abandon that stuff 

2643
01:34:57,631 --> 01:35:00,811
and be mature.
But when I was a kid I was super 

2644
01:35:00,811 --> 01:35:01,970
embarrassed when I became an adult that 
I still like muscle cars.

2645
01:35:02,270 --> 01:35:04,250
It's like,
why do I like these stupid things?

2646
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:07,090
And I loved them.
I would see one drive by here,

2647
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:08,480
the rumble and go,
Ooh,

2648
01:35:08,510 --> 01:35:10,850
that's awesome.
That thing,

2649
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:14,000
and then when I became an older adult I 
was like,

2650
01:35:14,001 --> 01:35:15,470
who gives a fuck?
That's really what it is.

2651
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,220
That's where I'm now looking at what 
Karen's manager,

2652
01:35:17,450 --> 01:35:22,450
because I love video games.
I play a lot of video games and people 

2653
01:35:22,450 --> 01:35:22,450
was like,
oh my God,

2654
01:35:22,450 --> 01:35:23,260
your children.

2655
01:35:23,270 --> 01:35:23,950
Yeah,
dude,

2656
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:25,230
awesome man.
There was nothing.

2657
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:29,240
There is no better way to kill an hour,
especially after a stressful day then to

2658
01:35:29,241 --> 01:35:30,840
go and shoot aliens.
You know what I mean?

2659
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:31,900
This is like,
you know what I mean?

2660
01:35:31,910 --> 01:35:33,410
This stimulates the mind.
I mean,

2661
01:35:33,590 --> 01:35:35,300
Jamie and I have talked about this many 
times,

2662
01:35:35,301 --> 01:35:40,301
that we have this deep appreciation for 
chess and go and all these ancient 

2663
01:35:40,301 --> 01:35:44,411
games.
There are games like starcraft and even 

2664
01:35:44,411 --> 01:35:48,770
like one on one quake matches that 
require intense calculating.

2665
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:53,800
Right?
You have to think about the environment 

2666
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:53,800
understanding of the map that you're 
right,

2667
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:54,280
you're competing in.
It's,

2668
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:55,970
there's a lot of strategy.
No,

2669
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,160
that's really good about it.
I mean,

2670
01:35:57,170 --> 01:35:58,190
I,
I tend to be,

2671
01:35:58,191 --> 01:35:59,860
I do a lot.
I really like rpgs.

2672
01:35:59,861 --> 01:36:01,730
You know,
so with a map and everything,

2673
01:36:01,731 --> 01:36:03,390
so one of them everquest dorks.
Oh,

2674
01:36:03,391 --> 01:36:05,600
well I don't do,
I don't do anything multi player.

2675
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,300
Right?
Because I'm so bad at it that like,

2676
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:09,230
I know there's some kids,
some 13 year old in Korea.

2677
01:36:09,231 --> 01:36:11,620
It was just like your dad or your dead 
spawn dies.

2678
01:36:11,621 --> 01:36:16,621
Spawn.
But I like something with a really good 

2679
01:36:16,621 --> 01:36:16,621
story.
You know,

2680
01:36:16,621 --> 01:36:16,621
whether you would.
What's the game you like?

2681
01:36:16,850 --> 01:36:19,310
Oh God,
my favorite game is last of us.

2682
01:36:19,670 --> 01:36:21,110
What does that.
Oh Man,

2683
01:36:21,111 --> 01:36:23,150
last bucket.
Because I don't want,

2684
01:36:23,151 --> 01:36:27,280
I don't like Zombie Games because I 
could scared being scared when I,

2685
01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:30,410
I saw um,
when we do the living versus zombies.

2686
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:32,570
That's a nice simple one that might 
work.

2687
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:33,350
Uh,
no,

2688
01:36:33,351 --> 01:36:36,110
I still have the um,
now the living dead when I was 12 it was

2689
01:36:36,111 --> 01:36:38,480
on pbs and little screen and it just 
like after that.

2690
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:39,620
I'm sorry.
Zombies.

2691
01:36:39,650 --> 01:36:40,740
Wow.
Yeah,

2692
01:36:40,830 --> 01:36:42,800
it was,
I can't believe they put it on tv like,

2693
01:36:42,801 --> 01:36:44,630
you know,
for the 11:00

2694
01:36:45,020 --> 01:36:45,470
show.

2695
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:50,680
So,
but last of us is kind of a Zombie 

2696
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:51,440
survival story,
but it's beautiful.

2697
01:36:51,441 --> 01:36:53,870
I mean,
it's really the narrative of it.

2698
01:36:53,871 --> 01:36:56,420
It's this guy your 20 years after and 
the thing about this thing,

2699
01:36:56,421 --> 01:36:57,640
it opens up with the,
you know,

2700
01:36:57,650 --> 01:37:00,440
the Zombie outbreak happening and the 
guy loses his daughter,

2701
01:37:00,650 --> 01:37:02,690
like you see him lose his daughter and 
it's so,

2702
01:37:02,691 --> 01:37:04,220
well,
it's the same company that did,

2703
01:37:04,221 --> 01:37:05,050
um,
uh,

2704
01:37:05,070 --> 01:37:06,620
uncharted,
which are other.

2705
01:37:06,621 --> 01:37:08,110
I really like those as well.
Um,

2706
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:13,540
and so she's like,
the acting in it was really beautiful 

2707
01:37:13,540 --> 01:37:13,540
and then,
you know,

2708
01:37:13,540 --> 01:37:13,540
it's 20 years later and this guy is 
broken,

2709
01:37:13,540 --> 01:37:14,360
you know what I mean?
Like he's just,

2710
01:37:14,361 --> 01:37:14,860
he's,
you know,

2711
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:16,730
he's,
he survived in this,

2712
01:37:16,731 --> 01:37:19,100
you have the society's falling apart.
Um,

2713
01:37:19,550 --> 01:37:20,210
but,
uh,

2714
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:22,610
you know,
he just track him as he gets this,

2715
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:27,640
this young girl who is immune and he's 
got to take her cross country to,

2716
01:37:27,711 --> 01:37:32,711
you know,
and you're following this guy story and 

2717
01:37:32,711 --> 01:37:32,711
you know,
then there's zombies and there's a,

2718
01:37:32,711 --> 01:37:34,400
the theme of a movie,
a really recent movie.

2719
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:39,400
Wasn't that like a,
a foreign movie with a Foreign Zombie 

2720
01:37:41,511 --> 01:37:43,730
movie that was supposed to be very good.
But that was the idea behind it.

2721
01:37:43,731 --> 01:37:44,870
It was,
but it was his own daughter wasn't.

2722
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:48,940
Maybe it wasn't the fact that they took 
it from this because you know,

2723
01:37:48,941 --> 01:37:51,430
so last of us is one like huge amounts 
of awards.

2724
01:37:51,460 --> 01:37:54,260
How old is it?
Six years,

2725
01:37:54,261 --> 01:37:56,340
maybe less.
Month two is just about to come out.

2726
01:37:56,370 --> 01:38:01,370
Well,
the sports center movies older than 

2727
01:38:01,370 --> 01:38:02,721
that,
I believe because it came out right 

2728
01:38:02,721 --> 01:38:05,320
around the time where his wife left him 
because he banged the maid.

2729
01:38:09,290 --> 01:38:10,530
Whoops.
Downfall.

2730
01:38:10,740 --> 01:38:12,480
Lips.
He was the governor then wasn't even the

2731
01:38:12,481 --> 01:38:12,980
governor.
He's there.

2732
01:38:12,990 --> 01:38:14,110
He's posting.
It was post.

2733
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:16,530
It was post post governor.
Um,

2734
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:21,920
but that,
that theme is a reoccurring theme that 

2735
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:23,080
is a reoccurrence of telling you.
How many times is that comeback?

2736
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:25,710
The plague wipes people out.
They come back to life.

2737
01:38:25,711 --> 01:38:28,050
There's zombies.
So you gotta wonder what's up with that,

2738
01:38:28,051 --> 01:38:30,270
like why is that something that's like 
stirring around in our head?

2739
01:38:30,271 --> 01:38:35,271
I think the apocalypse is because we 
kind of feel nervous about what's 

2740
01:38:35,271 --> 01:38:35,271
happening with us because we can see 
sort of sure.

2741
01:38:35,271 --> 01:38:37,290
Pushing up against boundaries.
We're also vulnerable.

2742
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:38,390
Yeah.
Running.

2743
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,780
We're vulnerable to disease and we're 
vulnerable.

2744
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:45,860
I mean,
there's so many different things that 

2745
01:38:45,860 --> 01:38:47,391
people can get.
Rabies and malaria plagues we used to 

2746
01:38:47,391 --> 01:38:48,510
have plagues all the time,
you know,

2747
01:38:48,690 --> 01:38:49,950
so yeah.
No,

2748
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:55,250
but that's what makes this game so great
is that it really takes the world after 

2749
01:38:55,250 --> 01:38:56,070
the fall,
seriously.

2750
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:57,960
And it's heartbreaking.
You know what I mean?

2751
01:38:57,961 --> 01:38:59,160
That's,
it's beautifully done,

2752
01:38:59,310 --> 01:39:01,140
scarier than Shit,
but,

2753
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:02,460
you know,
beautifully done.

2754
01:39:02,461 --> 01:39:03,000
And it's,
for me,

2755
01:39:03,001 --> 01:39:08,001
it's like everything that I love mostly 
because like you're saying is you get 

2756
01:39:08,001 --> 01:39:08,070
into these situations and you know 
you're going to get killed.

2757
01:39:08,130 --> 01:39:09,300
You look,
there's dark souls were like,

2758
01:39:09,301 --> 01:39:10,600
there's no getting through dark,
dark souls.

2759
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:12,780
Apparently the most hardest game ever.
I've never played it.

2760
01:39:13,170 --> 01:39:15,190
But you know,
this game is hard and you got to keep it

2761
01:39:15,191 --> 01:39:17,390
as dark souls.
Dark souls is a,

2762
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:18,990
it's also a story based,
uh,

2763
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:20,120
you know,
open world games,

2764
01:39:20,121 --> 01:39:22,110
single player,
I think that it's probably a multiplayer

2765
01:39:22,111 --> 01:39:23,550
mode,
but um,

2766
01:39:23,910 --> 01:39:25,020
uh,
it's like,

2767
01:39:25,021 --> 01:39:27,000
you know,
a kind of an elvish,

2768
01:39:27,030 --> 01:39:28,110
you know,
you're in that kind of world.

2769
01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:30,270
You're just trying to stay alive,
trying to stay alive.

2770
01:39:30,271 --> 01:39:32,790
And it's just like the hardest game 
ever.

2771
01:39:32,910 --> 01:39:34,370
That's what they say.
Um,

2772
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:34,950
but like,
you know,

2773
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:37,180
I said a good hard game.
You gotta you know,

2774
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:38,670
you gotta you can keep going back like,
oh,

2775
01:39:38,671 --> 01:39:39,870
I just died.
All right,

2776
01:39:39,871 --> 01:39:41,590
let me try it.
Let me try coming around from this side,

2777
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:42,080
you know,
Oh,

2778
01:39:42,090 --> 01:39:43,740
let me use this weapon.
Let me get on this.

2779
01:39:44,010 --> 01:39:45,540
It's really that we did,
uh,

2780
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:45,890
my,
my,

2781
01:39:45,910 --> 01:39:50,910
um,
I had a text book that just came out a 

2782
01:39:50,910 --> 01:39:50,910
couple of years ago and we did a video 
game.

2783
01:39:50,910 --> 01:39:53,760
We built a full first ever full video 
game for an intro astronomy course.

2784
01:39:53,970 --> 01:39:58,970
And the whole idea was like,
the coolest thing about a game is like 

2785
01:39:58,970 --> 01:39:58,970
the first thing you have to do is learn 
the rules.

2786
01:39:58,970 --> 01:40:02,990
Right?
And that's what makes being in a game 

2787
01:40:02,990 --> 01:40:02,990
world interest there,
you know,

2788
01:40:02,990 --> 01:40:04,050
there's a whole set of rules,
got know how to craft.

2789
01:40:04,050 --> 01:40:06,480
You got to know which weapons to use in 
different kinds of situations.

2790
01:40:06,690 --> 01:40:08,310
And our idea with the video game was 
like,

2791
01:40:08,311 --> 01:40:10,260
just make the real.
The real rules make um,

2792
01:40:10,261 --> 01:40:11,070
the science rules,
right?

2793
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:12,480
Oh,
you want to go mine an asteroid?

2794
01:40:12,481 --> 01:40:13,910
Well,
how do you know which asteroid has,

2795
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:14,400
you know,
the,

2796
01:40:14,430 --> 01:40:15,690
the most,
uh,

2797
01:40:15,691 --> 01:40:16,140
you know,
uh,

2798
01:40:16,141 --> 01:40:17,030
or in it,
you know,

2799
01:40:17,050 --> 01:40:19,260
I'm just going to do what you're going 
to do normally do an astronomy.

2800
01:40:19,261 --> 01:40:20,160
So I think like,
you know,

2801
01:40:20,610 --> 01:40:23,490
video games have not recognized.
They haven't,

2802
01:40:23,550 --> 01:40:28,550
like you said,
people don't understand actually how 

2803
01:40:28,550 --> 01:40:29,730
important they are for teaching,
for all kinds of things.

2804
01:40:29,731 --> 01:40:31,040
Video Games and for entertaining,
you know,

2805
01:40:31,041 --> 01:40:33,030
for,
for a future of storytelling to.

2806
01:40:33,390 --> 01:40:38,390
Well people take them,
they think that it's a waste of time 

2807
01:40:38,390 --> 01:40:38,750
until they find out how much these 
professionals make it.

2808
01:40:38,820 --> 01:40:41,360
So saying that some guy,
what,

2809
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:45,780
what is the number?
That kid was making $500,000

2810
01:40:45,781 --> 01:40:47,770
a month playing fortnite.
Wasn't that what Sean,

2811
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:49,820
that sugar.
But it's way more than that.

2812
01:40:49,890 --> 01:40:52,030
He makes more than that.
So what is fortnight you?

2813
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:54,070
Can somebody explain fortnight to me?
I'm sorry,

2814
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:57,220
I'm still in far cry.
Five crazy third person shooter.

2815
01:40:57,221 --> 01:41:00,010
You're jumping around shooting be boomed
with third person shooters.

2816
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:01,920
But like is it a story or is it just 
like you're,

2817
01:41:01,980 --> 01:41:03,310
you know,
you've got other people people up.

2818
01:41:03,311 --> 01:41:06,430
I think the story is really just drop it
into survive.

2819
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:11,580
Oh yeah,
there's no campaign mode or if they're 

2820
01:41:11,580 --> 01:41:11,580
just,
there is,

2821
01:41:11,580 --> 01:41:11,580
but that's a separate.
That's not whatever.

2822
01:41:11,580 --> 01:41:12,610
That's interesting to me about 
fortnight.

2823
01:41:13,050 --> 01:41:16,370
The graphics suck.
I don't want you.

2824
01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:19,170
To me,
that's a graphic style that those hit at

2825
01:41:19,190 --> 01:41:21,920
that it has like a,
like a,

2826
01:41:22,060 --> 01:41:23,880
uh,
xbox to sort of.

2827
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:25,510
Yeah.
Somebody had a,

2828
01:41:25,511 --> 01:41:28,930
uh,
an image and it was from 2007.

2829
01:41:28,970 --> 01:41:29,920
It said,
man,

2830
01:41:29,921 --> 01:41:34,921
look at this.
I wonder what video games are going to 

2831
01:41:34,921 --> 01:41:37,410
be looking like.
The graphics gonna be looking like a 

2832
01:41:37,410 --> 01:41:39,341
2018,
and then it shows fort night and it's 

2833
01:41:39,341 --> 01:41:39,341
like,
this is like,

2834
01:41:39,341 --> 01:41:39,341
dude,
they're just like,

2835
01:41:39,341 --> 01:41:40,090
they've turned the textures off.

2836
01:41:40,450 --> 01:41:45,450
They 100 percent.
You turned the textures off when you 

2837
01:41:45,450 --> 01:41:47,401
play online,
if you don't have a powerful enough 

2838
01:41:47,401 --> 01:41:47,401
computer,
sure you don't like claiming.

2839
01:41:47,401 --> 01:41:48,580
Right?
So it doesn't make your streaming,

2840
01:41:48,610 --> 01:41:51,430
it doesn't make your video game.
Video card works so hard,

2841
01:41:51,580 --> 01:41:55,450
but also it makes it easier to recognize
shapes because they're not like,

2842
01:41:55,660 --> 01:42:00,660
that was the thing that did with quake.
They would completely turn the textures 

2843
01:42:00,660 --> 01:42:03,841
off when guys would be like playing in 
high level matches and you would just 

2844
01:42:03,841 --> 01:42:05,740
deal with these flat walls and then the 
object,

2845
01:42:05,770 --> 01:42:07,450
the person that you were fighting 
against,

2846
01:42:07,451 --> 01:42:09,640
what they would stand out and start 
contrast.

2847
01:42:09,641 --> 01:42:10,100
Right,
right.

2848
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:11,440
So you didn't have,
you know,

2849
01:42:11,441 --> 01:42:16,441
otherwise you'd be in this castle wall.
You'd have the incredible textures on 

2850
01:42:16,441 --> 01:42:18,650
the wall and you wouldn't be able to see
them as easily too distracting.

2851
01:42:18,990 --> 01:42:23,990
Mean.
That's one of the thing I think I love 

2852
01:42:23,990 --> 01:42:23,990
about video games too,
is like the scenery,

2853
01:42:23,990 --> 01:42:27,230
you know,
sometimes I just want to stop and be 

2854
01:42:27,230 --> 01:42:27,230
like,
that's it.

2855
01:42:27,230 --> 01:42:30,810
The right side has full graphics,
not so it depends on what you were 

2856
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:31,120
actually.
The right side is reasonable.

2857
01:42:31,121 --> 01:42:34,300
I mean it still is a little bit.
That's not much different at all.

2858
01:42:35,110 --> 01:42:36,460
Yeah.
Yeah.

2859
01:42:36,461 --> 01:42:38,380
I mean sort of the left side is just 
dark.

2860
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:39,960
There's grass.
Yeah.

2861
01:42:39,970 --> 01:42:44,970
Look at the graph building.
There's still some movement on the 

2862
01:42:44,970 --> 01:42:46,450
ground.
It's not flat plain like it isn't quick.

2863
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:47,890
Go to quake,
play,

2864
01:42:48,070 --> 01:42:51,310
go to quake three,
no textures.

2865
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:56,760
Make a video or pull up a video of that 
and you'll see what I'm talking about 

2866
01:42:56,760 --> 01:43:01,051
when I'm talking about is like literal 
flat walls where people turned 

2867
01:43:01,051 --> 01:43:05,431
everything off and it got to a point 
where they weren't allowing it and 

2868
01:43:05,431 --> 01:43:07,330
certain competitions because it makes 
such a big difference because now you're

2869
01:43:07,331 --> 01:43:12,331
just like,
it's a target in front of a blank 

2870
01:43:12,331 --> 01:43:12,331
screen.
They also,

2871
01:43:12,331 --> 01:43:14,770
you could also replace all of the 
characters with a larger character,

2872
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:20,040
like a,
like say if you were playing as this 

2873
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:20,040
girl,
so I get this one.

2874
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:23,070
It's showing the mod in between.
Maybe I'm thinking,

2875
01:43:23,940 --> 01:43:24,970
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

2876
01:43:24,971 --> 01:43:26,830
I'm losers quake.
I've heard of.

2877
01:43:26,870 --> 01:43:29,460
Or you pitch.
No,

2878
01:43:29,470 --> 01:43:30,160
no.
Jamie,

2879
01:43:30,790 --> 01:43:31,960
pull,
pull up,

2880
01:43:31,990 --> 01:43:33,720
quake,
no textures,

2881
01:43:34,470 --> 01:43:35,440
pull up,
quake,

2882
01:43:35,470 --> 01:43:40,470
no textures,
and then you could watch what it looks 

2883
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:40,470
like.
That is not.

2884
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:40,960
No textures,
that that's different.

2885
01:43:40,961 --> 01:43:43,660
You can see the difference in the colors
and things are moving.

2886
01:43:43,661 --> 01:43:46,660
It's when they turn off all the 
textures,

2887
01:43:46,661 --> 01:43:48,640
you,
you get to see these flat.

2888
01:43:48,641 --> 01:43:49,690
Well,
that's what it looks like.

2889
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:51,080
Seat.
Yeah.

2890
01:43:51,290 --> 01:43:55,640
Now that is a way different experience.
It would be much easier to see.

2891
01:43:55,641 --> 01:43:57,710
Right.
You can't see those still exist,

2892
01:43:57,950 --> 01:44:02,950
but all the textures are gone and if you
show a video that see if you could find 

2893
01:44:02,950 --> 01:44:07,181
a video that jamie when in the videos 
you see things moving around with no 

2894
01:44:07,181 --> 01:44:11,321
textures and you realize what an 
advantage it would be if you were 

2895
01:44:11,321 --> 01:44:11,321
playing someone who's.

2896
01:44:11,321 --> 01:44:13,130
You're constantly dealing with all this 
visual input.

2897
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:18,160
You have all this different shit,
high visibility and quake three that 

2898
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:18,480
it's hard to find out.
Is this.

2899
01:44:18,620 --> 01:44:20,300
Which game is this?
Quake live.

2900
01:44:20,350 --> 01:44:20,810
Oh,
okay.

2901
01:44:20,811 --> 01:44:23,030
This is again,
I still got to ask what is quick?

2902
01:44:23,031 --> 01:44:28,031
I mean,
I know I've heard of it but I've never 

2903
01:44:28,031 --> 01:44:29,261
played it.
Like it's the ultimate first person 

2904
01:44:29,261 --> 01:44:30,530
shooter and it's the original one.
It was originally quake one and.

2905
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:33,980
Well there was doom but it was doing.
I've heard of like I've even,

2906
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:35,500
we did doom,
didn't they?

2907
01:44:35,501 --> 01:44:40,501
They came out with another.
Didn't they come out with another 

2908
01:44:40,501 --> 01:44:40,501
version of Dune?
Yes they did.

2909
01:44:40,501 --> 01:44:41,060
And there's another one that's coming 
out soon.

2910
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:44,060
Um,
but what quake one was,

2911
01:44:44,061 --> 01:44:49,061
was these cool maps and you run around 
and shoot each other and you'd have 

2912
01:44:49,061 --> 01:44:53,441
these death matches,
so one on one death matches and shoot 

2913
01:44:53,441 --> 01:44:53,441
rockets at each other and shit.

2914
01:44:53,441 --> 01:44:57,730
And it's,
you're seeing it through your 

2915
01:44:57,730 --> 01:44:57,730
perspective.
Like,

2916
01:44:57,730 --> 01:45:01,001
so if you have a rocket launcher,
you see the rocket launcher in front of 

2917
01:45:01,001 --> 01:45:01,001
you are there.
Now that whole idea,

2918
01:45:01,290 --> 01:45:02,100
what does this one,
oh,

2919
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:04,610
this is quake champions.
This is the newest version.

2920
01:45:04,611 --> 01:45:09,611
I mean,
the graphics are fucking incredible on 

2921
01:45:09,611 --> 01:45:09,611
these things.
Now they,

2922
01:45:09,611 --> 01:45:09,680
they're so excited.
We're gonna have.

2923
01:45:09,690 --> 01:45:13,790
We're setting up a land here,
a local area network here.

2924
01:45:13,791 --> 01:45:16,400
What we're going to stream live and play
each other.

2925
01:45:16,490 --> 01:45:19,580
Excellent and a waste massive amounts of
time.

2926
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:22,640
And I'm sure I'm going to go bad 
sometimes I'm sorta like,

2927
01:45:22,641 --> 01:45:27,641
oh,
three hours just went going to go to 

2928
01:45:27,641 --> 01:45:27,641
sleep a little bit.
Oh,

2929
01:45:27,641 --> 01:45:28,490
well,
whatever do it will suck up your time.

2930
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:29,360
It'll suck,
but you know,

2931
01:45:29,410 --> 01:45:30,440
I can't play.
I'm just,

2932
01:45:30,441 --> 01:45:32,310
I'm not good enough to play those kinds 
of things.

2933
01:45:32,311 --> 01:45:35,600
Like it's just like spawn dice bond guy 
can figure out how to do it.

2934
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:37,850
You're a smart guy.
How dare you say that?

2935
01:45:38,620 --> 01:45:40,990
You put the limitations on myself?
Yeah,

2936
01:45:41,090 --> 01:45:46,080
you can't do that.
We just need to learn left wasd.

2937
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:51,340
Learn how to move your fingers around.
The console's are bullshit.

2938
01:45:51,921 --> 01:45:52,730
I.
Lots of people say,

2939
01:45:52,940 --> 01:45:55,430
I can't get any real accuracy with a 
console.

2940
01:45:55,431 --> 01:45:57,710
That's your problem.
How do you do with the finger?

2941
01:45:57,711 --> 01:45:58,830
That type?
I mean the console now.

2942
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,030
Good.
I can send to you.

2943
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,300
How do you learn physics?
How do you.

2944
01:46:02,301 --> 01:46:06,380
What is that?
All this fucking movie.

2945
01:46:06,381 --> 01:46:07,310
We were like,
you can do it,

2946
01:46:07,311 --> 01:46:08,060
man.
You can't.

2947
01:46:08,061 --> 01:46:10,550
It's like rocky or something that's 
ready to karate kid or whatever.

2948
01:46:11,680 --> 01:46:13,190
Hasn't been ever done that for video 
games.

2949
01:46:13,191 --> 01:46:16,280
He's never been that movie where someone
teaches someone how to play a video game

2950
01:46:17,180 --> 01:46:18,920
nerd in the beginning and he's like a 
loser,

2951
01:46:18,921 --> 01:46:20,660
but you know it comes back and it gets 
the girl.

2952
01:46:20,690 --> 01:46:25,690
Well,
one of the reasons why I wanted to talk 

2953
01:46:25,690 --> 01:46:27,311
to you about this in particular is 
because I am more and more convinced 

2954
01:46:27,311 --> 01:46:31,481
that it's our future may lie in some 
artificially created world and that 

2955
01:46:31,971 --> 01:46:36,971
people are more interested and more 
attracted everyday to virtual reality,

2956
01:46:38,210 --> 01:46:40,550
augmented reality,
virtual reality,

2957
01:46:40,551 --> 01:46:42,530
and what can change.
What was that game?

2958
01:46:42,590 --> 01:46:47,270
That one game where there was a,
you created worlds.

2959
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:48,630
I was going to pull that up earlier and 
ask.

2960
01:46:48,650 --> 01:46:49,920
It's called no man's sky.
Oh,

2961
01:46:49,921 --> 01:46:50,010
I

2962
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:51,180
played that.
I played that.

2963
01:46:51,181 --> 01:46:52,620
I bought it because of course any space 
game.

2964
01:46:52,621 --> 01:46:55,400
I'm like whoring though it is because 
you know,

2965
01:46:55,410 --> 01:46:57,530
they have 80 trillion worlds,
but they're all this.

2966
01:46:57,660 --> 01:46:59,340
They're basically,
they don't look that different,

2967
01:46:59,341 --> 01:47:00,050
you know.
So it's like oatmeal,

2968
01:47:00,090 --> 01:47:00,960
$80,
million bottles

2969
01:47:02,470 --> 01:47:07,470
there.
You go there and people are shooting 

2970
01:47:07,470 --> 01:47:07,470
each other and stealing money.

2971
01:47:07,470 --> 01:47:07,470
No,
no.

2972
01:47:07,470 --> 01:47:08,700
What is better for that kind?
Yeah,

2973
01:47:08,710 --> 01:47:09,400
right.
I mean it's,

2974
01:47:09,401 --> 01:47:10,450
you know,
it looked like it was people,

2975
01:47:10,451 --> 01:47:12,910
but what's better is I'm elite.
Dangerous.

2976
01:47:12,970 --> 01:47:15,040
So after this I was so disappointed in 
this,

2977
01:47:15,310 --> 01:47:17,440
uh,
I went back and I found a leap.

2978
01:47:17,441 --> 01:47:19,570
Dangerous,
which is disappointing because there was

2979
01:47:19,571 --> 01:47:20,530
no action.
Yeah,

2980
01:47:20,531 --> 01:47:22,660
there was nothing.
You just ran around and your mind stuff.

2981
01:47:22,661 --> 01:47:25,570
It was sort of like,
it just wasn't nothing exciting.

2982
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:27,180
There was nothing exciting.
There was no,

2983
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:28,510
there was no,
like I said,

2984
01:47:28,511 --> 01:47:31,060
I don't usually play sort of these 
massive multiplayer games.

2985
01:47:31,061 --> 01:47:32,580
So this is elite.
Dangerous is elite.

2986
01:47:32,590 --> 01:47:35,080
Dangerous end of this man.
The trading or you know,

2987
01:47:35,081 --> 01:47:36,580
you can decide like,
oh I want to be a,

2988
01:47:36,581 --> 01:47:38,350
I want to be a bounty hunter,
you know?

2989
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:41,620
And it was so rich.
I just,

2990
01:47:41,621 --> 01:47:46,621
I spent.
There was like a good six months of my 

2991
01:47:46,621 --> 01:47:46,621
life that I was working my way,
getting better ships.

2992
01:47:46,621 --> 01:47:47,680
I became because who doesn't want to be 
a bounty hunter?

2993
01:47:47,681 --> 01:47:48,460
Right.
You know what I'm saying?

2994
01:47:48,461 --> 01:47:51,310
Like that's what everybody's and this 
just this game had you know,

2995
01:47:51,311 --> 01:47:51,960
and there's like,
I don't know,

2996
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,000
a few hundred thousand people in there.
You're creating the universe.

2997
01:47:55,001 --> 01:47:57,280
It's evolving.
They add storylines.

2998
01:47:57,310 --> 01:48:01,720
So you know,
while we are setting up an htc vive here

2999
01:48:01,780 --> 01:48:02,920
and we're,
we.

3000
01:48:03,310 --> 01:48:05,470
Danny was htc vive,
how dare you.

3001
01:48:05,490 --> 01:48:06,490
I know man.
It's like,

3002
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:10,320
you know,
you call your nerd,

3003
01:48:11,140 --> 01:48:16,140
um,
they will never not have sex in virtual 

3004
01:48:16,140 --> 01:48:16,140
reality.

3005
01:48:16,140 --> 01:48:20,530
It's,
and it's consumer virtual reality when 

3006
01:48:20,530 --> 01:48:20,960
my friends never done the boy.
Yeah,

3007
01:48:20,970 --> 01:48:21,710
I know.
I've been waiting.

3008
01:48:21,711 --> 01:48:23,120
I've been sort of.
Well,

3009
01:48:23,121 --> 01:48:26,720
we tried to get one.
Jamie went out yesterday and look,

3010
01:48:26,721 --> 01:48:29,570
they're all sold out so we had to order 
one and so we're ordering one.

3011
01:48:29,571 --> 01:48:31,310
We're going to have it set up in here.
Um,

3012
01:48:31,370 --> 01:48:32,700
and the,
uh,

3013
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:37,720
the Games,
I played the games of two years ago and 

3014
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:38,450
I'm sure they're way more advanced than 
they are now.

3015
01:48:38,870 --> 01:48:43,870
There's a crazy archery game where the,
you're on the top of a castle and these 

3016
01:48:43,870 --> 01:48:46,130
little monsters that look like they 
could be in south park.

3017
01:48:46,131 --> 01:48:47,610
They're not like detailed,
right?

3018
01:48:47,890 --> 01:48:52,890
Kinda cool looking monsters and you 
shoot out on with bows and arrows that 

3019
01:48:52,890 --> 01:48:52,890
are trying to invade the castle.
But man,

3020
01:48:52,890 --> 01:48:54,830
it's addictive because you really look 
down,

3021
01:48:54,831 --> 01:48:57,560
you see them all around you.
You have like a real.

3022
01:48:57,730 --> 01:49:00,070
So how did they know?
Just always been my question about like,

3023
01:49:00,071 --> 01:49:05,071
you know,
I sit on my chair and I play my video 

3024
01:49:05,071 --> 01:49:05,071
game.
So like our.

3025
01:49:05,071 --> 01:49:05,071
Yes,

3026
01:49:05,071 --> 01:49:07,890
see this guy has a thing in his hands 
and he's moving around.

3027
01:49:07,891 --> 01:49:12,891
This is like a star wars one and there's
a bunch of different ones that I've 

3028
01:49:12,891 --> 01:49:13,290
always got to be standing.
Right.

3029
01:49:13,291 --> 01:49:14,400
In some sense.
Yes.

3030
01:49:15,170 --> 01:49:17,510
Do you want to just like sit down with a
borrower and Ken,

3031
01:49:17,610 --> 01:49:20,400
but there's also a boxing one that you 
get a real workout in.

3032
01:49:20,750 --> 01:49:23,820
So it's a game and I played it over 
Duncan's house.

3033
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:28,110
We think there's a video of it,
but it's weird because you punch wrong.

3034
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:29,430
So like,
um,

3035
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:31,620
the like if I'm holding my hands like 
this,

3036
01:49:31,621 --> 01:49:34,470
which is,
I'm holding my hands vertically where my

3037
01:49:34,471 --> 01:49:35,880
thumbs are up,
right?

3038
01:49:36,090 --> 01:49:41,090
The boxing gloves would be horizontal,
like they would be if you were punching 

3039
01:49:41,090 --> 01:49:42,180
someone.
So.

3040
01:49:42,190 --> 01:49:43,660
So it doesn't do the turn.
No,

3041
01:49:43,710 --> 01:49:48,710
it's weird.
So as you move your hands forward like 

3042
01:49:48,710 --> 01:49:51,321
this,
which you really wouldn't punch like 

3043
01:49:51,321 --> 01:49:51,321
that,

3044
01:49:51,321 --> 01:49:53,760
the punches come out.
So they've got an iron that I was going 

3045
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:54,710
to say that'll be something that'll work
out and that and make the,

3046
01:49:54,780 --> 01:49:57,370
the controller rotate the way a fist 
would.

3047
01:49:57,730 --> 01:50:02,730
But as you're doing it,
you throw real punches and someone's 

3048
01:50:02,730 --> 01:50:03,010
throwing punches at you and when they 
throw punches you and they hit you,

3049
01:50:03,011 --> 01:50:05,300
you see a white flash in front of you.
That's good.

3050
01:50:05,430 --> 01:50:07,930
Makes you nervous.
Just like real sparring does.

3051
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:09,150
Well,
you know.

3052
01:50:09,151 --> 01:50:14,151
And so like this question of like,
what are we going to do with virtual 

3053
01:50:14,151 --> 01:50:14,151
reality?
Because like I said,

3054
01:50:14,151 --> 01:50:14,151
you know,
I already,

3055
01:50:14,151 --> 01:50:18,790
you know,
I see huge potential for like education 

3056
01:50:18,790 --> 01:50:19,040
in gaming and that's why we built our 
games.

3057
01:50:19,070 --> 01:50:19,630
Yeah.
Here's,

3058
01:50:20,020 --> 01:50:24,220
this is me over Duncan's house.
Just the one anybody to walk by.

3059
01:50:24,221 --> 01:50:25,090
You know,
I got to go get a beer.

3060
01:50:25,091 --> 01:50:26,860
Bam.
I'm beating this guy up.

3061
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:29,260
Moving around them.
See,

3062
01:50:29,261 --> 01:50:34,261
that's the thing I've always wondered 
because that guy was fucking duck enough

3063
01:50:34,811 --> 01:50:35,560
everyday.
It's like,

3064
01:50:35,561 --> 01:50:36,640
dude,
how did you.

3065
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:38,770
I'm just like,
move around,

3066
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:42,490
don't stand right in front of the rope a
dope.

3067
01:50:42,670 --> 01:50:43,270
Well,
you gotTa,

3068
01:50:43,300 --> 01:50:48,300
you gotTa have footwork and movement,
but you can really get a workout with 

3069
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:48,460
that.
I'm not joking.

3070
01:50:48,630 --> 01:50:50,850
You get exhausted and you know,
you,

3071
01:50:50,870 --> 01:50:53,920
you keep going and fight a tougher and 
tougher opponents.

3072
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:55,120
Well,
you know,

3073
01:50:55,121 --> 01:50:55,820
that's.
And that's the way,

3074
01:50:55,830 --> 01:50:57,270
you know.
So like talk about haptic suits.

3075
01:50:57,320 --> 01:50:59,110
Like eventually you know,
you're going to wear things.

3076
01:50:59,111 --> 01:51:01,420
I didn't see the,
I read the book but I didn't see the uh,

3077
01:51:01,450 --> 01:51:03,780
what was it?
The movie ready?

3078
01:51:03,790 --> 01:51:04,870
Set.
Ready player one.

3079
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:05,960
I didn't see it either.
I didn't see you.

3080
01:51:05,970 --> 01:51:10,970
Have you ever read the book?
The book's really good because the book 

3081
01:51:10,970 --> 01:51:10,970
is like full immersion.

3082
01:51:10,970 --> 01:51:13,710
Like the whole book is about like when 
virtual reality is it and so everybody 

3083
01:51:13,710 --> 01:51:17,581
has these suits that,
you know and you're kind of in this 

3084
01:51:17,581 --> 01:51:19,291
ball,
you play the game and so he can run and 

3085
01:51:19,291 --> 01:51:19,291
you know,
um,

3086
01:51:19,291 --> 01:51:19,291
but in some sense,
yes,

3087
01:51:19,291 --> 01:51:20,620
we're just starting out along these 
lines.

3088
01:51:20,621 --> 01:51:25,621
Well,
they have these places you can go that 

3089
01:51:25,621 --> 01:51:25,621
they have a warehouse set up and you go 
inside of it.

3090
01:51:25,621 --> 01:51:29,971
And I went through one with my kids and 
it's a star wars one at Disneyland,

3091
01:51:30,490 --> 01:51:33,780
Dude.
It's fucking why you go across.

3092
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:38,820
You're walking across this platform like
they have all these different places 

3093
01:51:38,820 --> 01:51:39,430
where you actually walk through and as 
you're walking through,

3094
01:51:39,431 --> 01:51:41,650
you looked to the left and to the right 
and there's fire,

3095
01:51:42,010 --> 01:51:45,070
but you feel the heat from the fire.
It's fucking crazy.

3096
01:51:45,530 --> 01:51:47,230
Like heater set up.
So that blows up.

3097
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:49,090
And Storm troopers start shooting at 
you.

3098
01:51:49,091 --> 01:51:50,800
This is it right here.
What is it called?

3099
01:51:50,860 --> 01:51:52,150
The void.
The void.

3100
01:51:52,180 --> 01:51:53,740
Yeah.
And um,

3101
01:51:53,890 --> 01:51:55,240
you do this,
I'm telling you man,

3102
01:51:55,241 --> 01:52:00,241
this is better than any of the rides at 
Disneyland and it's just outside of 

3103
01:52:00,241 --> 01:52:02,150
Disneyland in downtown Disney.
So you don't have to pay to get into get

3104
01:52:02,370 --> 01:52:03,610
it.
But it costs,

3105
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,360
I think it's $35 for a half an hour.
It's not cheap,

3106
01:52:07,361 --> 01:52:09,070
but it's not too bad.
It's not too bad.

3107
01:52:09,080 --> 01:52:12,430
Like it's fucking awesome.
I mean it is awesome.

3108
01:52:12,580 --> 01:52:14,790
So.
So the question is what happens with the

3109
01:52:15,310 --> 01:52:16,000
future,
right?

3110
01:52:16,001 --> 01:52:17,680
Because you have virtual reality.
We're just on the cusp of,

3111
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:22,720
right?
We're just beginning to like start 

3112
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:25,021
playing around with these technologies 
because people have been saying it for 

3113
01:52:25,021 --> 01:52:25,021
years and it kind of sucked.
It was sort of clunky.

3114
01:52:25,021 --> 01:52:25,021
Well,
we're,

3115
01:52:25,021 --> 01:52:26,080
we're,
we used to play Pong,

3116
01:52:26,350 --> 01:52:26,650
right?

3117
01:52:27,100 --> 01:52:29,680
That's what I started with.
I'm a 55.

3118
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:31,990
I'm 50,
so I remember Pong.

3119
01:52:31,991 --> 01:52:34,810
We were excited.
I can't believe I'm controlling the TV,

3120
01:52:35,590 --> 01:52:40,590
making the thing move on.
The TV or asteroids flew the Star Wars 

3121
01:52:40,631 --> 01:52:41,620
game,
I think it was called asteroids,

3122
01:52:41,621 --> 01:52:45,120
but you flew through the trenches 
fucking wire frame,

3123
01:52:45,580 --> 01:52:48,200
but it was amazing time.
Dropped a lot of quarters.

3124
01:52:48,230 --> 01:52:51,710
Sure.
So go from that to what you were showing

3125
01:52:51,711 --> 01:52:56,180
us here with these crazy new space games
and then imagine what these mean.

3126
01:52:56,181 --> 01:52:59,000
The Star Wars thing today.
The void is really cool,

3127
01:52:59,390 --> 01:53:02,330
but you know that it's not real,
but it's cool,

3128
01:53:02,870 --> 01:53:04,160
but you know,
it's not real.

3129
01:53:04,210 --> 01:53:05,540
Well,
you're not going to be able to tell.

3130
01:53:05,541 --> 01:53:06,960
It's not real and 20 years.
Yeah.

3131
01:53:07,020 --> 01:53:09,130
Right.
And how much time are you spending suit,

3132
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:10,940
by the way when you do this?
Oh really?

3133
01:53:10,950 --> 01:53:13,170
You know,
there's the pressure of you and you feel

3134
01:53:13,171 --> 01:53:14,360
that when you getting shot,
wow.

3135
01:53:14,510 --> 01:53:17,450
You feel like,
you know,

3136
01:53:17,451 --> 01:53:20,130
it's funny,
even with the controller on my crappy ps

3137
01:53:20,131 --> 01:53:21,530
four who,
um,

3138
01:53:21,590 --> 01:53:22,460
you know,
when it vibrates,

3139
01:53:22,461 --> 01:53:24,770
when you,
to sort of give you,

3140
01:53:24,830 --> 01:53:29,830
it's amazing how much the brain sort of 
picks up on these signals when you're 

3141
01:53:29,830 --> 01:53:30,470
using the htc vive and you draw the 
Arrow back.

3142
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:34,160
When it gets to the nocking point,
you feel it like it's cool.

3143
01:53:34,450 --> 01:53:37,780
You release is a feeling in your hand 
seeing the Arrow.

3144
01:53:37,810 --> 01:53:39,050
It's really cool.
Yeah.

3145
01:53:39,051 --> 01:53:40,670
So what happens when,
you know,

3146
01:53:40,810 --> 01:53:41,780
right.
I can be sort of like,

3147
01:53:41,781 --> 01:53:42,360
you know,
Grandpa,

3148
01:53:42,361 --> 01:53:45,350
but like terrible people shouldn't be 
going out in nature,

3149
01:53:45,410 --> 01:53:46,790
which I think they should be.
They should,

3150
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:47,580
you know,
now.

3151
01:53:47,630 --> 01:53:48,170
Um,
but,

3152
01:53:48,171 --> 01:53:48,680
you know,
I always,

3153
01:53:48,681 --> 01:53:50,420
I'm always aware whenever I'm sort of 
like,

3154
01:53:50,421 --> 01:53:51,560
oh shit,
this is gonna be terrible.

3155
01:53:51,561 --> 01:53:53,540
I always remember the whole you can see 
in like,

3156
01:53:53,541 --> 01:53:55,030
I think at some point,
socrates,

3157
01:53:55,150 --> 01:53:56,000
2000,
five years,

3158
01:53:56,270 --> 01:53:57,230
500 years ago,
it was like,

3159
01:53:57,260 --> 01:53:58,600
Ooh,
kids to do the robots.

3160
01:53:58,850 --> 01:54:00,300
That's all right.
Um,

3161
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:01,160
so,
you know,

3162
01:54:01,161 --> 01:54:02,810
who knows what we'll do with it and you 
know,

3163
01:54:02,811 --> 01:54:03,540
hopefully,
you know,

3164
01:54:03,550 --> 01:54:04,430
maybe it'll help,
you know,

3165
01:54:04,431 --> 01:54:05,130
maybe.
I don't know,

3166
01:54:06,050 --> 01:54:07,880
I don't want to be like,
oh that's terrible,

3167
01:54:07,881 --> 01:54:10,780
but there clearly are going to be 
dangerous with this.

3168
01:54:10,820 --> 01:54:12,410
A different game.
Jamie doesn't new one.

3169
01:54:12,740 --> 01:54:16,800
Oh boy.
I'm going to be fucked.

3170
01:54:17,790 --> 01:54:18,200
The.
Yeah,

3171
01:54:18,201 --> 01:54:20,150
just the hands.
Yeah.

3172
01:54:20,210 --> 01:54:23,480
And so your,
you have two little hand controllers and

3173
01:54:23,481 --> 01:54:28,481
one of them would be the Arrow and the 
other one would be the bow and you were 

3174
01:54:28,481 --> 01:54:28,481
them and that's the haptic part in 
Italy.

3175
01:54:28,481 --> 01:54:29,360
There's controllers on them.
Well,

3176
01:54:29,361 --> 01:54:34,361
you feel the Arrow vibrating against the
riser of the blow as you draw it back 

3177
01:54:34,611 --> 01:54:36,380
to.
It's really cool.

3178
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:38,630
Well it's funny because you know,
we've talked about like,

3179
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:40,430
you know,
for the game that we built,

3180
01:54:40,431 --> 01:54:40,940
which was awesome.

3181
01:54:40,950 --> 01:54:44,630
It was really a lot of fun to actually 
go through the process of like,

3182
01:54:44,631 --> 01:54:46,220
how do you know,
how do you script it,

3183
01:54:46,430 --> 01:54:47,810
how do you teach people,
you know,

3184
01:54:47,811 --> 01:54:52,811
like,
because that whole thing that when we 

3185
01:54:52,811 --> 01:54:52,811
get into when you're a good game,
right.

3186
01:54:52,811 --> 01:54:55,661
You know,
when the first couple hours of a game 

3187
01:54:55,661 --> 01:54:55,661
and you're just learning the basic stuff
and you get excited like,

3188
01:54:55,661 --> 01:54:55,661
oh,
this is,

3189
01:54:55,661 --> 01:54:57,230
this is a cool world to be in.
Um,

3190
01:54:57,620 --> 01:54:59,200
but I'd be interested to think sort of,
you know,

3191
01:54:59,210 --> 01:55:02,630
at some point to try vr for the same 
thing because what you want,

3192
01:55:02,631 --> 01:55:05,300
you can have people be tacked on.
They're not just sort of in their head,

3193
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:07,070
what else can you do to show to show 
them,

3194
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:09,720
teach them things you know,
like glaciers or you know,

3195
01:55:09,780 --> 01:55:10,490
mean.
Sure.

3196
01:55:10,710 --> 01:55:15,710
Well that's another thing in Disneyland,
they have a thing called soaring over 

3197
01:55:15,710 --> 01:55:19,061
the world that you sit in a chair and 
you get raised up and there's a giant 

3198
01:55:19,061 --> 01:55:21,830
like imax style screen and it flies you 
over these environments.

3199
01:55:21,980 --> 01:55:23,900
It's incredible.
So beautiful.

3200
01:55:24,230 --> 01:55:27,650
And you have different smells are in the
air and the different places that you go

3201
01:55:27,651 --> 01:55:29,070
to.
Like when you go over the Allergan.

3202
01:55:29,380 --> 01:55:30,080
Yeah,
the elephants.

3203
01:55:30,081 --> 01:55:33,210
You smell grass and hay.
And um,

3204
01:55:33,260 --> 01:55:36,740
I think that it's just a matter of time,
like as we were talking about before,

3205
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:41,420
where biological entities might not be 
necessary for space travel,

3206
01:55:41,421 --> 01:55:43,980
you might be able to send a robot put on
a suit and be able to

3207
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:46,560
experience these worlds like in real 
time.

3208
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:47,440
Yeah.
Well,

3209
01:55:47,441 --> 01:55:48,510
um,
so,

3210
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:49,560
you know,
you know,

3211
01:55:49,561 --> 01:55:52,890
the simulation argument,
maybe the philosophy arguing about the,

3212
01:55:52,891 --> 01:55:54,870
you know,
and so that's a really interesting idea.

3213
01:55:54,871 --> 01:55:56,580
Should we just run through it for people
who don't know it?

3214
01:55:57,210 --> 01:55:59,310
So I forgot who it was.
Nick Bostrom now,

3215
01:55:59,311 --> 01:56:00,810
maybe not Brandon Carter,
you know,

3216
01:56:00,811 --> 01:56:05,811
there's this guy philosopher came with 
this brilliant argument for like why 

3217
01:56:05,811 --> 01:56:09,981
we're probably a simulate.
We're probably somebody else's 

3218
01:56:09,981 --> 01:56:10,020
simulation self-aware simulation.
And the idea is like,

3219
01:56:10,021 --> 01:56:10,920
look,
if you get one,

3220
01:56:10,921 --> 01:56:15,921
you know,
we've been talking about like 

3221
01:56:15,921 --> 01:56:15,921
civilizations when they get a million 
years ahead,

3222
01:56:15,921 --> 01:56:16,800
what can they do that they're so 
powerful?

3223
01:56:16,801 --> 01:56:20,070
They can build computers that can 
simulate reality,

3224
01:56:20,071 --> 01:56:21,560
like fully simulate reality.
We're like,

3225
01:56:21,561 --> 01:56:22,520
you know,
just like in the matrix,

3226
01:56:22,550 --> 01:56:24,690
you have programs that are self aware 
and so,

3227
01:56:24,691 --> 01:56:29,691
you know,
once they get to that and they start 

3228
01:56:29,691 --> 01:56:29,691
running simulations in the world,
right,

3229
01:56:29,691 --> 01:56:29,730
it's cheaper to run.

3230
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:32,340
It's cheap to run simulations.
So they just run trillions of them.

3231
01:56:32,341 --> 01:56:37,341
Right?
So the idea is that from that argument 

3232
01:56:37,341 --> 01:56:40,080
there's more simulated realities then 
there is the one real reality.

3233
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:41,940
So odds are right,
you know,

3234
01:56:41,941 --> 01:56:44,970
if there's a trillion simulated 
realities in one real reality,

3235
01:56:45,150 --> 01:56:48,360
you're probably in a simulated reality 
are we a,

3236
01:56:48,390 --> 01:56:49,650
you know,
everything like right now you,

3237
01:56:49,651 --> 01:56:51,390
and I think this is real,
you know,

3238
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:56,420
but what we are is an incredibly 
detailed and we are self aware programs 

3239
01:56:56,420 --> 01:56:56,590
in,
you know,

3240
01:56:56,730 --> 01:56:59,160
silicon matrix of,
you know,

3241
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:01,620
uh,
so that argument is brilliant.

3242
01:57:01,621 --> 01:57:02,440
I mean,
you know,

3243
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:07,600
just from the,
just from the point of view of like 

3244
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:07,600
numbers.
Yeah,

3245
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:08,560
there's lots of reasons to say that's 
not possible but,

3246
01:57:08,570 --> 01:57:09,090
but it's,
you know,

3247
01:57:09,091 --> 01:57:10,740
raises this issue of like,
yeah,

3248
01:57:10,741 --> 01:57:12,810
what is simulation?
But if you were in a simulation,

3249
01:57:12,811 --> 01:57:17,811
the whole matrix thing,
if you were in a simulation that was 

3250
01:57:17,811 --> 01:57:20,571
that real,
how would you know now how could you 

3251
01:57:20,571 --> 01:57:22,260
know they're going to be if you allow 
technology to continue,

3252
01:57:22,261 --> 01:57:22,550
right?

3253
01:57:22,710 --> 01:57:25,290
If we keep moving forward at an 
exponential pace,

3254
01:57:25,291 --> 01:57:30,291
there's gonna come a point in time where
we have something that's 

3255
01:57:30,291 --> 01:57:30,960
indistinguishable from reality.
So how do we know that we're not already

3256
01:57:30,961 --> 01:57:32,910
in it?
Once we're in it,

3257
01:57:32,940 --> 01:57:37,940
will we create another reality?
Will we continue to create simulations 

3258
01:57:37,940 --> 01:57:39,570
inside of simulations?
So fractals,

3259
01:57:39,900 --> 01:57:42,960
fractals exist in nature.
They exist everywhere in the universe.

3260
01:57:43,290 --> 01:57:48,290
And there's,
there's also the argument that the 

3261
01:57:48,290 --> 01:57:48,420
atomic structure itself might really be 
a universe,

3262
01:57:48,450 --> 01:57:49,290
right?
Right.

3263
01:57:49,470 --> 01:57:52,740
Yeah.
Which is super standard talk.

3264
01:57:53,460 --> 01:57:54,540
But you know,
it's really.

3265
01:57:54,541 --> 01:57:54,860
I mean,
what,

3266
01:57:54,870 --> 01:57:56,100
that's why I love science fiction,
you know,

3267
01:57:56,101 --> 01:57:58,530
the explorations of these ideas,
you know,

3268
01:57:58,531 --> 01:58:01,630
I mean they're way out there and there 
an exercises,

3269
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:03,480
exercises and there's a way in which 
again,

3270
01:58:03,481 --> 01:58:05,970
when you think a million,
2 million years in the future,

3271
01:58:05,971 --> 01:58:08,310
this is why I hate the loop this back to
climate change,

3272
01:58:08,311 --> 01:58:10,110
but just like God,
if we could just make it through,

3273
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:12,060
who the fuck knows what we're going to 
be?

3274
01:58:12,450 --> 01:58:13,300
Right?
I mean there's the,

3275
01:58:13,590 --> 01:58:18,590
there's the whole universe.
One thing I did like about interstellar 

3276
01:58:18,590 --> 01:58:20,780
was the idea that like our future cells,
which have now become integrated,

3277
01:58:20,850 --> 01:58:23,240
the very fabric of reality,
you know,

3278
01:58:23,250 --> 01:58:28,250
that's how far you've evolved.
You become the laws of physics that 

3279
01:58:28,250 --> 01:58:28,680
they're kind of opening up the wormhole 
for us.

3280
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:29,720
So,
you know,

3281
01:58:29,730 --> 01:58:34,730
a million years is so long as he knows 
what we can become and it's just like,

3282
01:58:35,491 --> 01:58:37,200
you know,
don't hold this back.

3283
01:58:37,350 --> 01:58:38,460
I mean I'm,
you know,

3284
01:58:38,461 --> 01:58:42,340
I'm not a fan of the people that deny 
science,

3285
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:45,340
but one thing I am a fan of is watching 
them do it.

3286
01:58:45,950 --> 01:58:49,240
I like watching monkeys throw shit at 
the zoo,

3287
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:53,740
just something weird about watching 
people argue like really obvious,

3288
01:58:53,741 --> 01:58:55,540
right wing talking points and,
and,

3289
01:58:55,840 --> 01:59:00,840
and most of them by the way,
have no financial interest in climate 

3290
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:02,590
change one way or the other.
They're not,

3291
01:59:02,680 --> 01:59:07,680
they're not the wealthy elite.
There are these Weirdos that are like 

3292
01:59:07,680 --> 01:59:11,370
vampire familiars,
like they want to be recognized as like 

3293
01:59:11,370 --> 01:59:11,830
an eight,
an ally of the elite.

3294
01:59:11,831 --> 01:59:13,380
They think somehow under that that's 
going to get.

3295
01:59:13,490 --> 01:59:14,990
That's really what it is.
Right?

3296
01:59:15,390 --> 01:59:17,110
You know,
and it's like,

3297
01:59:17,140 --> 01:59:18,360
you know,
and again it's the tribalism,

3298
01:59:18,420 --> 01:59:23,420
but as you said,
it's like watching them do this and the 

3299
01:59:23,420 --> 01:59:23,530
part that's so frustrating is just that 
like,

3300
01:59:23,531 --> 01:59:25,060
dude,
you're using science.

3301
01:59:25,090 --> 01:59:27,210
It's not fair.
Of course they're like,

3302
01:59:27,211 --> 01:59:28,000
oh,
you get like,

3303
01:59:28,001 --> 01:59:33,001
you know,
you get into an accident and you're 

3304
01:59:33,001 --> 01:59:33,001
like,
Oh God,

3305
01:59:33,001 --> 01:59:33,001
please give me the MRI.

3306
01:59:33,001 --> 01:59:33,001
And then,
you know,

3307
01:59:33,001 --> 01:59:37,980
as soon as your arm healed,
you're going to be tweeting about how 

3308
01:59:37,980 --> 01:59:37,980
climate change is all bullshit.
The earth is flat.

3309
01:59:37,980 --> 01:59:40,330
Yeah,
sure what to do with that.

3310
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:46,720
I mean,
is this something we should pay 

3311
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:46,720
attention to her?
We should we just be like,

3312
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:46,720
okay,
you know,

3313
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:47,530
fine,
go ahead,

3314
01:59:47,531 --> 01:59:49,210
do your thing.
Isn't interesting.

3315
01:59:49,211 --> 01:59:54,211
Conversation with Neil degrasse Tyson 
about it and he said one of the real 

3316
01:59:54,211 --> 01:59:56,941
problems with debating these people 
elevate their profile and they're never 

3317
01:59:56,941 --> 01:59:59,911
going to believe in the first place and 
the reality is there's a mental illness 

3318
01:59:59,911 --> 02:00:01,720
involved in a lot of these people to 
schizophrenia.

3319
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:07,360
There's something wrong with them.
They believed this and then there's 

3320
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:10,671
this.
There's this massive lack of education 

3321
02:00:10,671 --> 02:00:13,920
and lack of reading.
They're not interested in understanding 

3322
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:16,090
how they know that the earth is round or
how they know that every other planet in

3323
02:00:16,091 --> 02:00:21,091
the solar system is round or how they 
know that every other planet that we've 

3324
02:00:21,091 --> 02:00:23,971
observed,
all the stars are around why they're 

3325
02:00:23,971 --> 02:00:26,251
round,
why it's a matter of mass and gravity 

3326
02:00:26,251 --> 02:00:26,251
and all these.

3327
02:00:26,251 --> 02:00:29,910
They don't care about all that,
but what they don't want to think 

3328
02:00:29,910 --> 02:00:30,490
because the government as if it's the 
government is like one cabal.

3329
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:35,520
That's what it is.
Equally minded people that are all 

3330
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:36,100
working together to fuck you over 
somehow by convincing you that the earth

3331
02:00:36,101 --> 02:00:38,830
is round.
It is one of the dumbest things,

3332
02:00:39,250 --> 02:00:44,250
but it's also a sign that we've created 
this world that's really easy to survive

3333
02:00:44,741 --> 02:00:49,741
in.
We've nerved all the hard edges and we 

3334
02:00:49,741 --> 02:00:50,340
keep the wolves off the streets and 
there's still these fucking dumb dumbs.

3335
02:00:50,540 --> 02:00:53,170
Uh,
and then they get online with computers,

3336
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:54,460
which is hilarious.
Yeah.

3337
02:00:54,550 --> 02:00:57,370
So these idiots did research,
like what'd you looked at?

3338
02:00:57,371 --> 02:01:00,090
A website like youtube videos.
Two videos.

3339
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:01,870
Yeah,
I mean it's,

3340
02:01:01,930 --> 02:01:03,250
it's,
it's kind of stunning.

3341
02:01:03,370 --> 02:01:04,000
Yeah.
Well actually,

3342
02:01:04,001 --> 02:01:09,001
no.
I think your point about actually we've 

3343
02:01:09,001 --> 02:01:09,001
made the world so safe because yeah,
there's a certain way like it,

3344
02:01:09,001 --> 02:01:14,000
you know,
in a hunter gatherer or those people 

3345
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,531
would be food.
Those are the people who were standing 

3346
02:01:16,531 --> 02:01:16,531
there looking at the tiger being like,
that's not a tiger.

3347
02:01:16,531 --> 02:01:18,100
Yeah,
exactly.

3348
02:01:18,910 --> 02:01:19,710
So,
uh,

3349
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:22,060
so and it's right.
But what's weird about that?

3350
02:01:22,061 --> 02:01:23,310
So that is like the,
the,

3351
02:01:23,450 --> 02:01:26,170
that like that is the dumbest shit you 
could possibly imagine.

3352
02:01:26,171 --> 02:01:27,160
So,
but oh,

3353
02:01:27,190 --> 02:01:28,480
there's dumber.
Oh Gosh.

3354
02:01:28,780 --> 02:01:33,780
Dumber people think there's aliens 
underneath the earth and there's 

3355
02:01:33,780 --> 02:01:38,120
Reptilians a secret cabal of kid fuckers
that run the world.

3356
02:01:38,861 --> 02:01:40,010
And you made

3357
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:41,750
a really excellent point,
just admitted to go,

3358
02:01:41,751 --> 02:01:46,751
right.
Which is like the philosopher Karl 

3359
02:01:46,751 --> 02:01:46,751
popper once said,
if there was a conspiracy,

3360
02:01:46,751 --> 02:01:46,751
it failed.
Right?

3361
02:01:46,751 --> 02:01:48,620
The whole conspiracy thing is that like,
oh yeah,

3362
02:01:48,680 --> 02:01:49,970
everybody's in on it.
Like,

3363
02:01:50,270 --> 02:01:51,260
as if like,
look,

3364
02:01:51,290 --> 02:01:54,740
there are the powerful.
They are the ones who control,

3365
02:01:54,741 --> 02:01:56,690
you know,
but they have their own agendas.

3366
02:01:56,691 --> 02:02:01,691
They're beating the crap.
That's the whole history of the world 

3367
02:02:01,691 --> 02:02:01,691
going after each other left and right.
It's about finances.

3368
02:02:01,830 --> 02:02:02,930
Right.
And the idea that like,

3369
02:02:02,931 --> 02:02:07,931
oh,
somebody's gonna be able to keep this 

3370
02:02:07,931 --> 02:02:07,931
amazing secret,
right.

3371
02:02:07,931 --> 02:02:08,390
You know about the earth is flat and 
never.

3372
02:02:08,391 --> 02:02:09,420
I mean,
you know,

3373
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:11,990
it just,
it gives people way more credit than you

3374
02:02:11,991 --> 02:02:12,480
know,
than,

3375
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:17,500
than they deserved.
So you'd have to have everybody on the 

3376
02:02:17,500 --> 02:02:20,351
same page,
all the different governments all over 

3377
02:02:20,351 --> 02:02:21,770
the world.
They're all a lie about like where's the

3378
02:02:21,771 --> 02:02:23,960
benefit in lying about the shape of the 
planet.

3379
02:02:24,110 --> 02:02:26,900
Right.
Right down the man was making money.

3380
02:02:27,110 --> 02:02:27,380
But,
you know,

3381
02:02:27,381 --> 02:02:32,381
here's what I,
here's what's really messed up is that 

3382
02:02:32,381 --> 02:02:32,381
like,
you know,

3383
02:02:32,381 --> 02:02:35,140
climate change denial is just like a 
slightly less wackadoodle version of 

3384
02:02:35,140 --> 02:02:35,390
that,
right?

3385
02:02:35,391 --> 02:02:36,390
Because,
you know,

3386
02:02:36,450 --> 02:02:37,630
um,
uh,

3387
02:02:37,640 --> 02:02:38,810
there's a guy,
writer,

3388
02:02:38,811 --> 02:02:40,230
philosopher,
uh,

3389
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:42,530
I forgot his name,
Morton forgot his first name,

3390
02:02:42,710 --> 02:02:45,230
but he talks about climate change being 
a hyper object,

3391
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:45,550
like,
you know,

3392
02:02:45,590 --> 02:02:48,540
that modern world.
We have things that are hyper objects to

3393
02:02:48,550 --> 02:02:53,550
me just so big that we just,
we have a hard time wrapping our minds 

3394
02:02:53,550 --> 02:02:55,060
around them and that hyper objects,
you know,

3395
02:02:55,130 --> 02:02:56,360
if we're going to evolve,
right,

3396
02:02:56,361 --> 02:03:00,410
we're going to evolve new behaviors.
One of them is the capacity to deal with

3397
02:03:00,411 --> 02:03:02,960
hyper objects,
but people want everything to be simple,

3398
02:03:03,140 --> 02:03:03,900
you know,
I mean,

3399
02:03:03,950 --> 02:03:06,530
which cracks me up because they're fine 
with this being complex,

3400
02:03:06,531 --> 02:03:11,531
you know,
their cell phone can be complex because 

3401
02:03:11,531 --> 02:03:11,531
I like to use it.

3402
02:03:11,531 --> 02:03:11,531
But like,
you know,

3403
02:03:11,531 --> 02:03:11,531
the idea that like,
you know,

3404
02:03:11,531 --> 02:03:12,540
uh,
the climate change,

3405
02:03:12,780 --> 02:03:13,470
climate change,
they,

3406
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:18,500
they need it.
It freaks them out because it's too 

3407
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:18,500
complicated or something.
So they go for the simple answer,

3408
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:20,510
which is that it's a,
it's a conspiracy,

3409
02:03:20,511 --> 02:03:22,280
it's a hoax.
I love this one.

3410
02:03:22,820 --> 02:03:26,330
The scientists are all doing it for the 
money as if my pay was that good that,

3411
02:03:26,331 --> 02:03:26,930
you know,
I mean,

3412
02:03:27,050 --> 02:03:32,050
I think a big issue happened with Al 
Gore when Al Gore came out with an 

3413
02:03:32,050 --> 02:03:35,921
inconvenient truth.
Everybody connected Al Gore with the 

3414
02:03:35,921 --> 02:03:38,771
left,
he's a Democrat and then they found out 

3415
02:03:38,771 --> 02:03:41,921
that he flies private jets and then like
this motherfucker like this is all 

3416
02:03:41,921 --> 02:03:43,010
bullshit.
And so there was enough.

3417
02:03:43,130 --> 02:03:48,130
There's enough holes where they started 
poking through and then looking for 

3418
02:03:48,130 --> 02:03:50,180
conspiracies and then looking to deny 
the whole thing.

3419
02:03:50,210 --> 02:03:51,650
I totally agree.
I really wish,

3420
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:53,540
you know,
I got nothing against Al Gore but.

3421
02:03:53,570 --> 02:03:58,570
But I wish he hadn't.
I wish he didn't become the face of 

3422
02:03:58,570 --> 02:03:58,570
climate change because it just pushed.
I mean I've only,

3423
02:03:58,570 --> 02:04:03,281
you know,
Neil degrasse Tyson or Sagan was still 

3424
02:04:03,281 --> 02:04:03,281
alive or you know,
had done it.

3425
02:04:03,281 --> 02:04:07,061
It would've been a totally different 
thing because it wouldn't have happened 

3426
02:04:07,061 --> 02:04:07,061
it off of it in an extreme way.
Yeah.

3427
02:04:07,061 --> 02:04:07,370
I mean,
I don't know.

3428
02:04:07,371 --> 02:04:08,060
I don't know what,
but,

3429
02:04:08,061 --> 02:04:08,560
but,
you know,

3430
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:11,420
pull up this article,
Al Gore may be the first,

3431
02:04:11,480 --> 02:04:16,480
um,
climate change billionaire or green 

3432
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:20,021
billionaire that he's,
he's made so much money doing these 

3433
02:04:20,021 --> 02:04:23,951
seminars and speeches and the film 
itself and they're doing this film,

3434
02:04:24,520 --> 02:04:25,110
right?
And then people,

3435
02:04:25,230 --> 02:04:26,780
I think it actually came out.
It didn't do that well.

3436
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:29,000
And then people in the amount of 
reading.

3437
02:04:29,240 --> 02:04:34,240
I think.
So I thought I saw Al Gore could be the 

3438
02:04:34,240 --> 02:04:37,090
world's first carbon billionaire,
formerly vice president become the 

3439
02:04:37,090 --> 02:04:39,360
world's first carbon billionaire after 
investing heavily in green energy.

3440
02:04:39,450 --> 02:04:40,740
That's okay.
That part's okay.

3441
02:04:41,100 --> 02:04:43,680
Because if he's investing in these 
companies and the companies start making

3442
02:04:43,681 --> 02:04:45,110
money,
which like already so sure,

3443
02:04:45,270 --> 02:04:48,660
solar employees,
more people now than cold does.

3444
02:04:48,920 --> 02:04:50,170
That's amazing.
Well,

3445
02:04:50,240 --> 02:04:52,620
coal,
but that was one of the dumbest things.

3446
02:04:52,621 --> 02:04:54,170
When,
when trump became president,

3447
02:04:54,171 --> 02:04:58,200
I got to bring back coal,
like how about bring back knocking rocks

3448
02:04:58,201 --> 02:04:59,580
together,
start fires.

3449
02:04:59,820 --> 02:05:04,820
It's like fuck man Cole.
It's as if the typewriter companies got 

3450
02:05:04,820 --> 02:05:05,640
together and made sure you never bought 
a computer.

3451
02:05:05,641 --> 02:05:10,641
Like we're going to computers illegal 
because you got to keep using 

3452
02:05:10,641 --> 02:05:12,330
typewriters.
Fucking terrible anymore.

3453
02:05:12,390 --> 02:05:13,110
It's like,
you know,

3454
02:05:13,111 --> 02:05:14,190
it's just,
but listen,

3455
02:05:14,191 --> 02:05:19,191
I got it.
One thing that you always got 

3456
02:05:19,191 --> 02:05:19,191
acknowledged is that like this,
you know,

3457
02:05:19,191 --> 02:05:20,010
when you change infrastructure is people
are going to get hurt.

3458
02:05:20,220 --> 02:05:22,050
You know what I mean?
Like I mean for those coal miners,

3459
02:05:22,051 --> 02:05:27,051
man,
that's what they've done their whole 

3460
02:05:27,051 --> 02:05:27,051
life.

3461
02:05:27,051 --> 02:05:27,051
It's been an honorable fucking thing and
they've,

3462
02:05:27,051 --> 02:05:27,060
you know,
so you can't just sort of be like,

3463
02:05:27,061 --> 02:05:28,230
hey,
we're switching infrastructure.

3464
02:05:28,231 --> 02:05:29,390
See Ya.
You know,

3465
02:05:29,400 --> 02:05:32,160
there's gotta be some deep understanding
of,

3466
02:05:32,250 --> 02:05:37,250
of,
of navigate have consequences and 

3467
02:05:37,250 --> 02:05:37,250
helping people who are going to be,
you know,

3468
02:05:37,250 --> 02:05:37,250
put,
you know,

3469
02:05:37,350 --> 02:05:38,850
train them how to put up solar,
you know,

3470
02:05:38,851 --> 02:05:43,851
solar panel.
How do you feel about universal basic 

3471
02:05:43,851 --> 02:05:43,851
income?
Have you ever looked into.

3472
02:05:43,851 --> 02:05:43,851
Yeah,
yeah,

3473
02:05:43,851 --> 02:05:43,851
no,
no,

3474
02:05:43,851 --> 02:05:44,700
I've thought about that a lot.
You know,

3475
02:05:44,701 --> 02:05:49,701
it's a big thought and consideration 
when it comes to automation technology 

3476
02:05:50,071 --> 02:05:52,320
and you know,
with the automation thing,

3477
02:05:52,321 --> 02:05:52,890
it's so true,
right?

3478
02:05:52,891 --> 02:05:57,891
Because you know,
when you think about what's been going 

3479
02:05:57,891 --> 02:05:57,891
on with the last election,
you know,

3480
02:05:57,891 --> 02:05:57,891
and everybody was like,
oh,

3481
02:05:57,891 --> 02:05:57,891
you know,
like you know what's happening with blue

3482
02:05:57,891 --> 02:06:01,050
collar people workers,
which is totally true,

3483
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:03,630
but like man,
it's not China,

3484
02:06:03,631 --> 02:06:04,590
it's automation.

3485
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:06,870
Right?
And that's what really is going to screw

3486
02:06:06,871 --> 02:06:08,790
up the whole nature of work,
you know,

3487
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:10,870
for everybody from truck drivers,
you know,

3488
02:06:10,871 --> 02:06:13,640
even to meet a university professors is 
we got this,

3489
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:18,680
the Ai,
you have the automation coming on and 

3490
02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:21,470
write what do you do?
What are you doing here as a university 

3491
02:06:21,470 --> 02:06:24,051
professor?
Is One day going to be retro that kids 

3492
02:06:24,051 --> 02:06:27,081
are going to want to learn online,
they're going to want to learn through 

3493
02:06:27,081 --> 02:06:29,990
some sort of an interactive course so 
that you can get on your phone rather 

3494
02:06:29,990 --> 02:06:31,020
than go to an actual physical place.
It's possible,

3495
02:06:31,080 --> 02:06:32,220
you know,
I mean it's possible,

3496
02:06:32,221 --> 02:06:37,221
but I think,
and this is going to be the whole 

3497
02:06:37,221 --> 02:06:37,221
question with the new economy or 
whatever,

3498
02:06:37,221 --> 02:06:40,581
whatever happens,
whatever we're moving into is finding 

3499
02:06:40,581 --> 02:06:40,581
those places where,
you know what,

3500
02:06:40,581 --> 02:06:40,581
I don't want a machine,
right?

3501
02:06:40,581 --> 02:06:41,400
I mean,
so right now like,

3502
02:06:41,401 --> 02:06:42,180
so when the,
what is it,

3503
02:06:42,181 --> 02:06:44,760
the moocs came out the massively online 
courses,

3504
02:06:44,950 --> 02:06:46,250
you know,
that was like five years ago.

3505
02:06:46,260 --> 02:06:51,260
Once I catch it,
universities are done and everybody's 

3506
02:06:51,260 --> 02:06:51,260
going to take these online courses and 
it never happened.

3507
02:06:51,260 --> 02:06:51,870
You know,
because people want to be together.

3508
02:06:51,871 --> 02:06:53,620
They want to learn,
they want the experience of happy,

3509
02:06:53,670 --> 02:06:55,380
you know,
my part of my students,

3510
02:06:55,381 --> 02:06:56,760
it's not just lecturing them,
agree,

3511
02:06:56,780 --> 02:06:58,380
lecture.
My students are probably.

3512
02:06:58,710 --> 02:07:00,600
I bet you are man,
you're a good talker.

3513
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:02,010
I had one student say,
I,

3514
02:07:02,011 --> 02:07:02,410
you know,
the,

3515
02:07:02,411 --> 02:07:04,950
the,
the reviews you get at the end,

3516
02:07:05,100 --> 02:07:05,760
the guy said,
hey,

3517
02:07:05,761 --> 02:07:07,020
I hate to say this,
but you know,

3518
02:07:07,230 --> 02:07:12,230
you should make those tapes for people 
to go to sleep because every class your 

3519
02:07:12,230 --> 02:07:13,410
voice.
And He meant it in a nice way.

3520
02:07:13,411 --> 02:07:18,411
He's like,
you have a nice voice that's passive 

3521
02:07:18,411 --> 02:07:19,010
aggressive.
So,

3522
02:07:19,020 --> 02:07:20,390
uh,
fuck whoever is,

3523
02:07:20,610 --> 02:07:22,200
um,
I think that,

3524
02:07:22,230 --> 02:07:23,640
uh,
I think people will always,

3525
02:07:23,641 --> 02:07:25,830
with education,
there'll be some component of it that,

3526
02:07:25,831 --> 02:07:27,030
yeah,
sure you can learn it online.

3527
02:07:27,030 --> 02:07:28,460
Went to,
but I think like,

3528
02:07:29,070 --> 02:07:30,900
you know,
we're going to have to,

3529
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:31,440
they'll,
there'll be,

3530
02:07:31,620 --> 02:07:36,620
there'll be a place for like people 
coming in and like learning in groups 

3531
02:07:36,620 --> 02:07:38,170
and somebody who has spent their whole 
life studying the thing,

3532
02:07:38,440 --> 02:07:40,180
telling you,
you know,

3533
02:07:40,270 --> 02:07:40,990
what's going on,
right?

3534
02:07:40,991 --> 02:07:43,120
Like there's a lot of things were like,
and we've lost a lot of this.

3535
02:07:43,121 --> 02:07:46,540
I'm a mentorship or apprenticeship,
right.

3536
02:07:46,541 --> 02:07:48,330
There's a lot of things she needed.
Somebody who knows,

3537
02:07:48,380 --> 02:07:49,390
you know,
who spent their whole life going,

3538
02:07:49,391 --> 02:07:49,720
oh,
you know,

3539
02:07:49,790 --> 02:07:52,120
you crank it this way.
Not that way because you got to get that

3540
02:07:52,121 --> 02:07:52,810
way.
It'll never work.

3541
02:07:52,811 --> 02:07:57,811
You know,
you can't learn that from watching a 

3542
02:07:57,811 --> 02:07:57,811
video or something.
Well,

3543
02:07:57,811 --> 02:07:58,270
there's certain things.
A martial arts,

3544
02:07:58,271 --> 02:08:01,120
which is a big part of my life.
You have to learn from a person can,

3545
02:08:01,140 --> 02:08:04,600
you got to have tiny things that they 
must show you while you're doing it,

3546
02:08:04,810 --> 02:08:06,580
but you can learn a lot of things from 
videos.

3547
02:08:07,390 --> 02:08:08,550
No doubt.
Yeah.

3548
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:11,440
There's a lot of things that people are 
putting up online,

3549
02:08:11,470 --> 02:08:14,110
instructional courses and stuff and I 
use some of them,

3550
02:08:14,111 --> 02:08:19,111
you know,
if I have to fix my sink and we're all 

3551
02:08:19,111 --> 02:08:19,111
going.
Oh,

3552
02:08:19,111 --> 02:08:19,111
for sure man.
Yeah.

3553
02:08:19,111 --> 02:08:19,300
It's kind of amazing,
you know,

3554
02:08:19,750 --> 02:08:20,650
so,
you know,

3555
02:08:20,651 --> 02:08:24,430
I think like with everything,
so we'll circle back to the UBI.

3556
02:08:24,730 --> 02:08:26,260
Um,
you know,

3557
02:08:26,261 --> 02:08:28,960
like with everything we're going to have
to invent new ways.

3558
02:08:28,990 --> 02:08:33,990
We will because we're just human beings.
Like there's a way in which we're going 

3559
02:08:33,990 --> 02:08:33,990
to find,
you know,

3560
02:08:33,990 --> 02:08:34,810
niche places that there will be 
economies where people make things.

3561
02:08:35,170 --> 02:08:36,070
But yeah,
in the end,

3562
02:08:36,071 --> 02:08:41,071
I mean ubi may be necessary.
I think it may really be necessary 

3563
02:08:41,071 --> 02:08:42,910
because if there's no work,
you know,

3564
02:08:43,270 --> 02:08:47,680
I mean that's a recipe for disaster for 
your democratic society.

3565
02:08:47,940 --> 02:08:48,740
Know.
Yeah.

3566
02:08:48,760 --> 02:08:53,760
Just hope we can move past this idea 
that everybody who needs that as some 

3567
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:54,310
sort of a welfare brat.

3568
02:08:54,610 --> 02:08:55,260
Yeah.
Right,

3569
02:08:55,300 --> 02:08:55,780
right.
Well,

3570
02:08:55,781 --> 02:08:58,060
you know,
once there's no work at all,

3571
02:08:58,500 --> 02:09:00,430
I mean they're good because like,
you know,

3572
02:09:00,431 --> 02:09:04,210
this is the thing that I like with a 
self driving cars.

3573
02:09:04,240 --> 02:09:09,240
Right.
So I asked this question a lot and I've 

3574
02:09:09,240 --> 02:09:09,240
written about this sort of like,
okay,

3575
02:09:09,240 --> 02:09:09,240
everyone's like,
we got to have self driving cars,

3576
02:09:09,240 --> 02:09:14,011
we're heading toward self driving cars,
self driving cars will destroy the last 

3577
02:09:14,011 --> 02:09:14,880
good blue collar job in America,
you know,

3578
02:09:14,890 --> 02:09:15,790
truck driving.
Right?

3579
02:09:15,791 --> 02:09:17,830
And that's a really good livelihood for 
a lot of people.

3580
02:09:18,010 --> 02:09:18,640
And it's like,
oh,

3581
02:09:18,641 --> 02:09:19,850
we're just gonna eliminate it.
It's like,

3582
02:09:20,660 --> 02:09:23,200
why do we have to like,
okay,

3583
02:09:23,201 --> 02:09:23,540
yeah,
there's,

3584
02:09:23,670 --> 02:09:25,300
you're telling me there's got to safety 
sake.

3585
02:09:25,510 --> 02:09:26,530
That's what they say,
right?

3586
02:09:26,531 --> 02:09:28,900
But in total it's not entirely clear,
right.

3587
02:09:28,901 --> 02:09:30,000
You know that,
that,

3588
02:09:30,001 --> 02:09:32,110
that will work.
And I,

3589
02:09:32,111 --> 02:09:33,730
you know,
what are the for the,

3590
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:36,220
for the lives that are lost in the 
driving,

3591
02:09:36,221 --> 02:09:36,620
I mean,
you know,

3592
02:09:36,630 --> 02:09:37,930
you know,
the car crashes,

3593
02:09:37,931 --> 02:09:42,931
is that going to be worth the social 
upheaval that comes from not having any 

3594
02:09:42,931 --> 02:09:42,931
work anymore?

3595
02:09:42,931 --> 02:09:45,210
So I mean just like they're these huge 
bearing down on us.

3596
02:09:46,030 --> 02:09:48,920
If it's your friend or your mom or.
I loved ones.

3597
02:09:49,020 --> 02:09:50,560
Yeah.
But these are the kind of calculus.

3598
02:09:50,561 --> 02:09:50,980
I mean,
you know,

3599
02:09:51,030 --> 02:09:52,510
if,
if it tears down,

3600
02:09:52,511 --> 02:09:57,511
if the,
if wiping out these jobs destroys 

3601
02:09:57,511 --> 02:09:57,511
democracy,
right.

3602
02:09:57,511 --> 02:10:01,120
And you end up with really though that 
doesn't seem possible.

3603
02:10:01,210 --> 02:10:05,950
I just think that what it's gonna do is 
gonna make travel safer and then we have

3604
02:10:05,951 --> 02:10:10,951
to figure out,
well these jobs that people got from 

3605
02:10:10,951 --> 02:10:11,990
traveling,
how do we replace that?

3606
02:10:12,280 --> 02:10:13,430
That income.
Right?

3607
02:10:13,480 --> 02:10:14,890
Well,
one of the things is we're going to,

3608
02:10:15,120 --> 02:10:17,500
we're going to have to start teaching 
kids to be creative.

3609
02:10:17,590 --> 02:10:22,590
Yeah.
That's the niche that I think there's 

3610
02:10:22,590 --> 02:10:22,590
going to be places where like the now 
you'll have.

3611
02:10:22,590 --> 02:10:23,370
So listen,
I'm not arguing that we shouldn't have.

3612
02:10:23,400 --> 02:10:24,790
No,
I know you're not just being,

3613
02:10:24,850 --> 02:10:26,040
you're just looking at all the 
variables.

3614
02:10:26,041 --> 02:10:27,380
Yeah.
And I'm asking like the CA,

3615
02:10:27,420 --> 02:10:32,420
you know,
we're moving so rapidly into this new 

3616
02:10:32,420 --> 02:10:32,420
world,
right?

3617
02:10:32,420 --> 02:10:33,980
That like who's deciding for us,
who's deciding

3618
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:37,250
that we want cars and we're told that 
we're going to get it.

3619
02:10:37,251 --> 02:10:39,380
But like a lot of these things I think 
there,

3620
02:10:39,410 --> 02:10:44,410
you know,
there needs to be a little bit more 

3621
02:10:44,410 --> 02:10:47,590
dialogue,
democracy rights and having this stuff 

3622
02:10:47,590 --> 02:10:47,990
shoved down our throats and told like 
it's the best thing ever,

3623
02:10:47,991 --> 02:10:49,160
you know?
Well,

3624
02:10:49,161 --> 02:10:50,420
you know,
how about Cell Towers?

3625
02:10:50,421 --> 02:10:55,421
They're fucking everywhere.
I mean there's no getting away from it 

3626
02:10:55,421 --> 02:10:55,421
if you could.
I mean,

3627
02:10:55,421 --> 02:10:57,200
is there a community anywhere that has 
made some sort of an agreement?

3628
02:10:57,201 --> 02:10:59,180
Will there be no cell towers in our 
community?

3629
02:10:59,950 --> 02:11:04,950
No.
But there are communities that have 

3630
02:11:04,950 --> 02:11:04,950
decided to,
like in the southwest that no lights,

3631
02:11:04,950 --> 02:11:09,100
no lights at night.
That's amazing because they wanted to 

3632
02:11:09,100 --> 02:11:10,670
preserve their nights guy.
We should really have some sort of a day

3633
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:15,880
where everybody shuts everything off,
sees the sky and see how crazy it is 

3634
02:11:15,880 --> 02:11:19,751
that we live in this weird state where 
we're on an organic spaceship flying 

3635
02:11:19,821 --> 02:11:22,190
through infinity and we don't see that.

3636
02:11:22,190 --> 02:11:22,510
Right.
Because,

3637
02:11:22,550 --> 02:11:27,550
you know,
if you're wanting to do backpacking or 

3638
02:11:27,550 --> 02:11:27,550
something,
you're in the back country,

3639
02:11:27,550 --> 02:11:27,550
you know,
a couple of days.

3640
02:11:27,550 --> 02:11:28,750
You notice things changing like Oh,
the mood's not as quite.

3641
02:11:28,770 --> 02:11:31,240
Yes.
And so nobody looks up now on your right

3642
02:11:31,250 --> 02:11:33,620
because there's nothing to see because 
you don't see anything because the light

3643
02:11:33,621 --> 02:11:38,621
pollution.
I went to the Keck observatory and the 

3644
02:11:38,621 --> 02:11:38,621
big island.
Have you been?

3645
02:11:38,621 --> 02:11:38,690
I've never been.
I'm a theorist.

3646
02:11:38,691 --> 02:11:43,691
I don't do it out.
Nobody's going to get me close to a 

3647
02:11:43,691 --> 02:11:43,691
telescope.
Could fucking just.

3648
02:11:43,691 --> 02:11:44,270
You don't even have to go all the way to
the observatory.

3649
02:11:44,271 --> 02:11:45,520
The visitor station,
which is,

3650
02:11:45,540 --> 02:11:50,540
I forget where it's at.
I think it's 14 or 12 or something like 

3651
02:11:50,540 --> 02:11:50,870
that.
It's really high.

3652
02:11:50,950 --> 02:11:52,670
Right.
But there's.

3653
02:11:52,730 --> 02:11:54,740
They have diffused lighting,
all of the big island.

3654
02:11:54,741 --> 02:11:58,070
So there's no light pollution and when 
you look up it is just stunning,

3655
02:11:58,100 --> 02:11:58,250
right?

3656
02:11:58,490 --> 02:12:01,520
You look up your leg the Milky Way,
right.

3657
02:12:01,521 --> 02:12:04,950
And most people have never seen the 
milky way right there.

3658
02:12:05,180 --> 02:12:10,180
Look,
I thought you have to have a telescope 

3659
02:12:10,180 --> 02:12:10,180
to see out.
No,

3660
02:12:10,180 --> 02:12:12,521
it's right there.
And you feel like you're flying through 

3661
02:12:12,521 --> 02:12:15,311
space and you have this,
this really humble feeling that I think 

3662
02:12:15,311 --> 02:12:16,190
people get into a couple of different 
places.

3663
02:12:16,191 --> 02:12:18,890
People get when they live next to 
mountains,

3664
02:12:19,160 --> 02:12:21,110
they get it when they live next to the 
ocean,

3665
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:23,870
but you really get it.
If you could see space,

3666
02:12:23,871 --> 02:12:27,650
and I think one of the things that is 
haunting the human race is the arrogance

3667
02:12:27,651 --> 02:12:32,651
of humans,
which is compounded by the fact that we 

3668
02:12:32,651 --> 02:12:33,140
can't see the cosmos,
that we only see what's in front of us,

3669
02:12:33,141 --> 02:12:35,710
so this is the world that we live in.
We put a roof over our head.

3670
02:12:35,750 --> 02:12:37,940
This is the box.
I've got my blinders on.

3671
02:12:38,090 --> 02:12:40,730
I'm moving ahead because I want a new 
lexus or whatever,

3672
02:12:40,750 --> 02:12:41,480
you know,
whatever it is,

3673
02:12:41,481 --> 02:12:43,730
whatever material thing you're trying to
possess when this,

3674
02:12:44,450 --> 02:12:48,500
this unstoppable force in front of.
When you look up and you see the cosmos,

3675
02:12:48,501 --> 02:12:52,010
it's like it's an undeniable reality and
you go,

3676
02:12:52,100 --> 02:12:53,470
oh,
okay,

3677
02:12:53,690 --> 02:12:55,940
okay.
This is just a small thing.

3678
02:12:56,690 --> 02:13:00,380
My existence is just a small thing in 
this mystery,

3679
02:13:00,410 --> 02:13:04,400
this giant mystery of what we just found
out 20 years ago.

3680
02:13:04,401 --> 02:13:05,200
There's plant itself,
right?

3681
02:13:05,201 --> 02:13:06,860
I mean,
this is a giant mystery.

3682
02:13:07,190 --> 02:13:10,940
You're looking up at a hundred billion 
stars in this galaxy alone.

3683
02:13:11,090 --> 02:13:11,960
Man,
I couldn't.

3684
02:13:11,961 --> 02:13:13,330
You're speaking my language,
I mean the,

3685
02:13:13,410 --> 02:13:16,460
you know,
the loss and the myth that the capital m

3686
02:13:16,461 --> 02:13:16,970
word,
right?

3687
02:13:16,971 --> 02:13:18,500
So I'm a scientist,
I'm an atheist,

3688
02:13:18,650 --> 02:13:23,650
but I believe in mystery.
I believe that that kind of at the core 

3689
02:13:23,650 --> 02:13:23,650
of our lives,
it's just,

3690
02:13:23,650 --> 02:13:24,490
I wake up everyday to forget here and 
I'm not going to,

3691
02:13:24,491 --> 02:13:29,491
I'm going to be here until I die and 
then I have no idea what the hell 

3692
02:13:29,491 --> 02:13:29,491
happens.
So,

3693
02:13:29,491 --> 02:13:29,491
you know,
and the,

3694
02:13:29,491 --> 02:13:30,620
as you said,
like mountain mountains in particular,

3695
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:32,190
you know,
I would think for mountains,

3696
02:13:32,370 --> 02:13:33,320
um,
the,

3697
02:13:33,500 --> 02:13:35,730
the night sky is,
it reminds you,

3698
02:13:35,731 --> 02:13:37,890
it opens that space up,
right.

3699
02:13:37,891 --> 02:13:38,940
You know,
when you're sort of like,

3700
02:13:39,700 --> 02:13:40,380
you know,
and you're right,

3701
02:13:40,390 --> 02:13:40,830
you can,
you know,

3702
02:13:40,840 --> 02:13:42,300
we can talk about it or you can,
you talk about it,

3703
02:13:42,440 --> 02:13:44,170
but it's really,
it's an experience.

3704
02:13:44,171 --> 02:13:47,950
It's the experience that just shows you 
your part of this.

3705
02:13:47,980 --> 02:13:51,370
It's more than you put your,
you're here and you know,

3706
02:13:51,371 --> 02:13:51,910
and I think,
right,

3707
02:13:51,911 --> 02:13:54,010
a lot of the stupidity of the modern 
age,

3708
02:13:54,011 --> 02:13:54,460
you know,
as you said,

3709
02:13:54,461 --> 02:13:59,461
the consumer is in particular.
All that matters to me is getting my 

3710
02:13:59,461 --> 02:13:59,461
next pile of shit.
Um,

3711
02:13:59,530 --> 02:14:01,750
when you're out there,
you realize who cares,

3712
02:14:01,810 --> 02:14:03,280
you know,
who freaking cares,

3713
02:14:03,281 --> 02:14:03,760
like,
you know,

3714
02:14:03,790 --> 02:14:08,790
for a moment even you just get the sense
of that mystery and it can be 

3715
02:14:08,790 --> 02:14:08,790
transformative.
You know,

3716
02:14:08,790 --> 02:14:13,200
I think what's happening is we've 
created these civilizations as 

3717
02:14:13,200 --> 02:14:17,011
civilizations need to be lit up.
The lights keep us from seeing the 

3718
02:14:17,011 --> 02:14:17,080
universe.
The universe humbles us,

3719
02:14:17,081 --> 02:14:21,280
so we're not humbled.
Then we moved towards acquiring physical

3720
02:14:21,281 --> 02:14:26,281
possessions,
material objects because we think that 

3721
02:14:26,281 --> 02:14:29,341
that's going to make us happy and our 
entire society is geared towards 

3722
02:14:29,341 --> 02:14:33,610
innovation because everybody wants the 
newest shiny shit that is,

3723
02:14:33,730 --> 02:14:38,680
that is what's leading us to artificial 
life and that all this shiny shit is all

3724
02:14:38,681 --> 02:14:42,250
innovation and it's eventually going to 
move to this one singularity.

3725
02:14:42,251 --> 02:14:44,090
And that singularity is some new being.

3726
02:14:44,300 --> 02:14:46,240
Yeah.
So it's funny because,

3727
02:14:46,250 --> 02:14:51,250
you know,
one thing when I think about like all 

3728
02:14:51,250 --> 02:14:51,250
these other,
you know,

3729
02:14:51,250 --> 02:14:51,250
my,
my argument,

3730
02:14:51,250 --> 02:14:52,070
all these other civilizations is that,
you know,

3731
02:14:52,390 --> 02:14:55,790
whether or not you make it maybe that 
the evolutionary heritage you get,

3732
02:14:55,791 --> 02:14:57,570
right?
So we evolved from,

3733
02:14:57,600 --> 02:15:02,600
you know,
both chimpanzees or the chimpanzee 

3734
02:15:02,600 --> 02:15:02,600
ancestor in the Bonobo ancestor.
So we've got like,

3735
02:15:02,600 --> 02:15:03,740
we fight,
we're hierarchical,

3736
02:15:03,770 --> 02:15:05,060
very hierarchical,
right?

3737
02:15:05,340 --> 02:15:06,410
Um,
so,

3738
02:15:06,570 --> 02:15:07,790
you know,
we've got a lot of aggression this,

3739
02:15:07,791 --> 02:15:09,410
but we also got the vanilla both kind of
like this,

3740
02:15:09,411 --> 02:15:10,640
just have sex,
everything's cool.

3741
02:15:10,641 --> 02:15:11,540
So we're like,
we're sort of,

3742
02:15:11,720 --> 02:15:16,720
we've got this really weird mixed 
evolutionary baggage and whether or not 

3743
02:15:16,720 --> 02:15:18,830
you can make it to the next side with 
the existential challenge of trigger and

3744
02:15:18,831 --> 02:15:23,180
climate change is kind of like a,
what your evolution evolution gave you,

3745
02:15:23,360 --> 02:15:28,360
you know,
because you can imagine species like 

3746
02:15:28,360 --> 02:15:28,360
hive minds,
you know,

3747
02:15:28,360 --> 02:15:28,360
if you came from termite and intelligent
termite species,

3748
02:15:28,360 --> 02:15:29,840
it might be a lot easier to deal with 
climate change.

3749
02:15:29,840 --> 02:15:31,380
You're like everybody,
you know,

3750
02:15:31,630 --> 02:15:32,340
get on the,
you know,

3751
02:15:32,490 --> 02:15:33,310
uh,
get on the,

3752
02:15:33,460 --> 02:15:35,300
get on the courts.
Um,

3753
02:15:35,510 --> 02:15:38,260
but uh,
most essentially is,

3754
02:15:38,261 --> 02:15:40,330
can you evolve new behaviors,
right?

3755
02:15:40,480 --> 02:15:42,910
So we've been on this track and it's 
leading us in a way that,

3756
02:15:42,980 --> 02:15:43,670
as you said,
you were,

3757
02:15:43,690 --> 02:15:48,690
it's like the shiny thing dangling in 
front of us is leading us off on this 

3758
02:15:48,690 --> 02:15:48,690
one track.
And the question is,

3759
02:15:48,690 --> 02:15:51,520
can we evolve new behaviors,
which I actually am going to say this,

3760
02:15:51,521 --> 02:15:53,170
I think they're,
part of it is spiritual,

3761
02:15:53,200 --> 02:15:58,200
you know,
or at least in my atheist way of 

3762
02:15:58,200 --> 02:15:58,200
reconnecting with mystery to see like,
uh,

3763
02:15:58,200 --> 02:16:02,821
you know,
we're part of this and we need to 

3764
02:16:02,821 --> 02:16:02,821
respect it.
And you know what,

3765
02:16:02,821 --> 02:16:03,760
when you say spiritual,
what do you mean?

3766
02:16:04,150 --> 02:16:06,320
So in my first book was about science 
and religion.

3767
02:16:06,440 --> 02:16:07,360
You know,
I'm an atheist,

3768
02:16:07,361 --> 02:16:12,361
but I'm not Richard Dawkins atheist.
I think that whole idea is the 

3769
02:16:12,361 --> 02:16:12,361
difference.
Well,

3770
02:16:12,361 --> 02:16:16,021
you know,
Richard Dawkins is what I would call a 

3771
02:16:16,021 --> 02:16:16,021
strident atheist and he's like,
Yo,

3772
02:16:16,021 --> 02:16:16,021
anybody who has any spiritual or any,
you know,

3773
02:16:16,021 --> 02:16:18,430
any inclination towards mystery is an 
idiot,

3774
02:16:18,520 --> 02:16:21,460
you know,
and she needs to do LSD,

3775
02:16:21,750 --> 02:16:24,880
right?
In sf or Dmt,

3776
02:16:25,630 --> 02:16:30,220
robin or something that just gives you 
an experience

3777
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:31,090
of mystery.
Right.

3778
02:16:31,300 --> 02:16:32,280
Exactly.
You know,

3779
02:16:32,500 --> 02:16:35,470
so I've been doing zen meditation for 
like the last 30 years,

3780
02:16:35,471 --> 02:16:36,190
you know,
and like,

3781
02:16:36,191 --> 02:16:41,191
you know,
so I've been staring at a wall for 30 

3782
02:16:41,191 --> 02:16:41,191
years and the first thing you learn is 
it's really boring.

3783
02:16:41,191 --> 02:16:41,980
And then the second thing you learned is
that their stuff onto your thoughts.

3784
02:16:42,070 --> 02:16:43,630
You are not just the shit you're 
thinking,

3785
02:16:43,930 --> 02:16:48,930
you know,
there's just sort of settled down and 

3786
02:16:48,930 --> 02:16:49,000
there's just like this openness,
you know.

3787
02:16:49,180 --> 02:16:50,350
And so,
um,

3788
02:16:50,530 --> 02:16:51,700
the spiritual part,
it's like you said,

3789
02:16:51,701 --> 02:16:52,450
you know,
when you're in the mountains,

3790
02:16:52,451 --> 02:16:57,451
right?
So I love doing back country hiking and 

3791
02:16:57,451 --> 02:16:57,451
union.
When you get above tree line,

3792
02:16:57,451 --> 02:17:00,671
there's that weird thing that happens 
when you're above tree line and just 

3793
02:17:00,671 --> 02:17:00,671
like,
you know,

3794
02:17:00,671 --> 02:17:03,580
you got this panorama around you and 
that thing is,

3795
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:04,870
you know,
the earth,

3796
02:17:04,900 --> 02:17:07,090
right,
of which we are part and you know,

3797
02:17:07,390 --> 02:17:12,390
so this is an interesting question about
how can virtual reality do this or do 

3798
02:17:12,390 --> 02:17:12,390
you actually need to get out there and 
kind of think you need to get out there.

3799
02:17:12,390 --> 02:17:15,310
But maybe virtual reality can give 
people the impetus to get out there.

3800
02:17:15,630 --> 02:17:16,800
You know?
Well,

3801
02:17:16,810 --> 02:17:21,810
it'll be a different experience.
I don't think there's anything wrong 

3802
02:17:21,810 --> 02:17:21,810
with the virtual reality experience of 
being in the mountains.

3803
02:17:21,810 --> 02:17:23,350
I think it'd probably be pretty fucking 
cool,

3804
02:17:23,590 --> 02:17:25,120
but it's not going to be being in the 
mountains.

3805
02:17:25,420 --> 02:17:27,070
Something about being in the mountains 
is also,

3806
02:17:27,071 --> 02:17:29,080
there's a,
there's a weird feeling,

3807
02:17:29,081 --> 02:17:31,700
and I don't know if it's real,
but there's a weird feeling that there's

3808
02:17:31,720 --> 02:17:35,140
no signal out there in the places where 
there's no cell signal.

3809
02:17:35,141 --> 02:17:40,141
There's no.
There's a feeling you get when you are 

3810
02:17:40,141 --> 02:17:40,141
absolutely not connected.
Yeah.

3811
02:17:40,141 --> 02:17:43,270
And then you see wildlife and the 
wildlife out there.

3812
02:17:43,271 --> 02:17:45,430
They're almost like these mystical 
beings,

3813
02:17:45,790 --> 02:17:50,100
like when you see a deer step out of the
tree line and it's like Hashtag.

3814
02:17:50,260 --> 02:17:55,260
Yeah.
That thing has been that way for a 

3815
02:17:55,260 --> 02:17:55,260
million years.

3816
02:17:55,260 --> 02:17:57,550
That's that species has not changed at 
all in a million years.

3817
02:17:57,850 --> 02:17:59,500
And the signal what you talk about the 
signal lights,

3818
02:17:59,501 --> 02:18:04,501
it's really the thing is what for me 
it's like when I get far enough back 

3819
02:18:04,501 --> 02:18:05,140
that I know that there's just not 
another human being,

3820
02:18:05,600 --> 02:18:08,170
you know,
this just like when I leave this exact,

3821
02:18:08,171 --> 02:18:13,171
it's going to still be happening.
Like it's doesn't give a shit about you 

3822
02:18:13,171 --> 02:18:13,750
and it's just moving along and as you 
say,

3823
02:18:13,751 --> 02:18:16,930
it's been moving this way for millions 
of years and you just realized like.

3824
02:18:16,940 --> 02:18:17,490
And that's why,
you know,

3825
02:18:17,500 --> 02:18:19,540
part of the thing I'm saying with the 
book is that like,

3826
02:18:19,720 --> 02:18:21,340
look,
if we trigger climate change,

3827
02:18:21,700 --> 02:18:24,090
that's just the earth way of like 
creating the next set,

3828
02:18:24,110 --> 02:18:27,550
you know,
it used us to create climate change to,

3829
02:18:27,590 --> 02:18:32,590
you know,
now move onto something else because 

3830
02:18:32,590 --> 02:18:32,590
that's what the earth does.
It's just this animal power,

3831
02:18:32,680 --> 02:18:34,810
you know,
and when you're out there you feel that,

3832
02:18:34,811 --> 02:18:35,330
um,
you know,

3833
02:18:35,400 --> 02:18:37,090
on the thing that I think we need to do 
is sort of,

3834
02:18:37,180 --> 02:18:42,180
we established our connection to that 
were part of that were from that we're 

3835
02:18:42,180 --> 02:18:43,450
not evil,
we're not bad.

3836
02:18:43,600 --> 02:18:47,020
We need to reintegrate ourselves in a 
way that we still get our civilization.

3837
02:18:47,290 --> 02:18:48,580
But you can.
That's what I mean.

3838
02:18:48,610 --> 02:18:52,780
So you ask why spiritual?
Because when we connect to that mystery,

3839
02:18:53,140 --> 02:18:58,140
then we're in a better place to make the
right decisions to understand what the 

3840
02:18:58,140 --> 02:18:58,140
decisions are.
If not,

3841
02:18:58,140 --> 02:18:58,140
we're like,
oh,

3842
02:18:58,140 --> 02:18:59,800
we've got to save the polar bears and 
we're not looking at.

3843
02:18:59,801 --> 02:19:00,160
No,
no.

3844
02:19:00,161 --> 02:19:03,410
It's the biosphere as a whole that we 
have to understand well,

3845
02:19:03,411 --> 02:19:08,411
operating out of ego and ideology and 
not out of rational thought with all the

3846
02:19:08,771 --> 02:19:13,771
information at our disposal and really 
verifying that information for 

3847
02:19:13,771 --> 02:19:16,941
understanding what's correct and what's 
not correct and whether or not there's 

3848
02:19:16,941 --> 02:19:20,010
bias behind it or scientific research 
that was funded by people that have a 

3849
02:19:20,010 --> 02:19:21,520
vested interest in it leaning one way or
the other.

3850
02:19:21,530 --> 02:19:23,020
Right.
All that stuff is very,

3851
02:19:23,021 --> 02:19:24,880
very slippery,
very dangerous,

3852
02:19:24,881 --> 02:19:27,100
and when you find out that studies have 
been influenced,

3853
02:19:27,590 --> 02:19:28,070
special

3854
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:31,280
interest groups or lobbyists or whatever
and that they,

3855
02:19:31,400 --> 02:19:36,400
you know,
like especially pharmaceutical studies 

3856
02:19:36,400 --> 02:19:37,940
of the creepiest where they,
they can do a series of studies and only

3857
02:19:37,941 --> 02:19:42,941
one of them show some sort of a positive
impact for whatever weird reason and 

3858
02:19:42,941 --> 02:19:44,660
that's the one they use and they don't 
have to publish the fact that they ran a

3859
02:19:44,660 --> 02:19:46,010
hundred fucking studies.
Right.

3860
02:19:46,070 --> 02:19:47,330
Do it.
I try and teach people.

3861
02:19:47,331 --> 02:19:47,850
I'm sorry,
go ahead.

3862
02:19:47,890 --> 02:19:48,090
No,
no,

3863
02:19:48,210 --> 02:19:48,630
go ahead.
Yeah,

3864
02:19:49,940 --> 02:19:52,400
I think the most important thing that 
people need to understand about science,

3865
02:19:52,401 --> 02:19:55,700
it's not so much sciences results,
but how science works,

3866
02:19:55,760 --> 02:19:56,840
you know,
because it does work,

3867
02:19:56,841 --> 02:20:01,841
right.
That's why we have all this stuff and 

3868
02:20:01,841 --> 02:20:01,841
so,
so they can distinguish.

3869
02:20:01,841 --> 02:20:01,841
So I,
you know,

3870
02:20:01,841 --> 02:20:06,221
I say that science is three things.
It's spitballs supertankers and 

3871
02:20:06,221 --> 02:20:06,221
stadiums,
right?

3872
02:20:06,221 --> 02:20:07,130
You know,
the problem with the news,

3873
02:20:07,131 --> 02:20:09,710
there'll be like the latest study shows 
the color red,

3874
02:20:09,711 --> 02:20:11,310
you know,
will make you have better sex.

3875
02:20:11,310 --> 02:20:12,530
It's like,
you know,

3876
02:20:12,720 --> 02:20:17,720
then it lets the latest study that can 
get you to click on that USA today or 

3877
02:20:18,190 --> 02:20:20,240
the media reports.
It's as if this was science,

3878
02:20:20,241 --> 02:20:22,400
like every day a whole bunch of new 
articles come out.

3879
02:20:22,430 --> 02:20:23,810
You know,
I write scientific articles,

3880
02:20:23,811 --> 02:20:27,710
that's the currency of my profession,
but like one study is,

3881
02:20:27,790 --> 02:20:29,360
is just like,
it's a spitball,

3882
02:20:29,390 --> 02:20:34,390
right?
It's like basically we're shooting 

3883
02:20:34,390 --> 02:20:34,390
spitballs at each other,
but science is like a super tanker,

3884
02:20:34,390 --> 02:20:34,390
right.
You know,

3885
02:20:34,480 --> 02:20:39,480
we're like,
it takes seven miles to turn a super 

3886
02:20:39,480 --> 02:20:39,480
tanker around.
That's what really science is the things

3887
02:20:39,480 --> 02:20:44,081
that we think we deeply understand.
Science is like the super tanker and 

3888
02:20:44,081 --> 02:20:47,291
people are shooting spitballs at the 
papers every day and if you get enough 

3889
02:20:47,291 --> 02:20:48,260
spit balls on one side of the,
you know,

3890
02:20:48,261 --> 02:20:50,770
the prow or whatever it starts to turn 
it right.

3891
02:20:50,840 --> 02:20:55,310
So the science will turn slowly if 
enough of the spit balls are lined up.

3892
02:20:55,550 --> 02:20:56,270
So people,
you know,

3893
02:20:56,271 --> 02:21:01,271
it's not about the single study,
it's about have there been 300 studies 

3894
02:21:01,271 --> 02:21:03,290
over the last 30 years that say the same
thing?

3895
02:21:03,350 --> 02:21:03,760
So like,
yeah,

3896
02:21:03,770 --> 02:21:04,910
the coffee stuff,
coffee's good.

3897
02:21:04,911 --> 02:21:09,911
Coffee's bad.
Clearly the fact that we keep getting 

3898
02:21:09,911 --> 02:21:09,911
both answers means we don't know.
That's all we don't know yet.

3899
02:21:09,911 --> 02:21:12,140
It's just not clear.
Climate change 30.

3900
02:21:12,141 --> 02:21:14,630
Not even 30 years.
A hundred years of the same results.

3901
02:21:14,810 --> 02:21:15,950
Yeah,
we got that.

3902
02:21:16,010 --> 02:21:21,010
You know,
well there's always a problem with diet 

3903
02:21:21,010 --> 02:21:23,141
in that you're not taking into account 
how nutrients interact with other foods 

3904
02:21:23,141 --> 02:21:24,920
or different foods interact with foods 
and different.

3905
02:21:25,140 --> 02:21:26,010
You know,
you know,

3906
02:21:26,140 --> 02:21:27,770
when you say coffee's bad.
Okay.

3907
02:21:27,771 --> 02:21:32,771
Was it bad when you're smoking 
cigarettes are bad when you're eating 

3908
02:21:32,771 --> 02:21:34,040
grass fed meat or bad when you're on a 
Vegan diet or when is it bad?

3909
02:21:34,070 --> 02:21:34,670
Right,
right.

3910
02:21:34,671 --> 02:21:39,671
Who are these people and what are they 
putting in their system and how much 

3911
02:21:39,671 --> 02:21:39,671
sugar are they taking in and how much 
sodium and you know,

3912
02:21:39,671 --> 02:21:41,210
what,
what's the nutrient levels,

3913
02:21:41,240 --> 02:21:41,810
their blood.

3914
02:21:41,810 --> 02:21:45,120
Did you test them for b12 deficiencies 
and all these different things.

3915
02:21:45,121 --> 02:21:47,930
Like that's the real problem with any 
dietary studies.

3916
02:21:48,060 --> 02:21:53,060
They don't take into account the 
extremely varied diet of and the 

3917
02:21:53,060 --> 02:21:53,060
complexity of the system.
Right.

3918
02:21:53,060 --> 02:21:53,570
So that's,
I mean,

3919
02:21:53,571 --> 02:21:54,950
so I would tell people that like,
you know,

3920
02:21:54,951 --> 02:21:58,250
when it comes to like health sciences,
anything in general about human beings.

3921
02:21:58,520 --> 02:22:03,520
Look,
this stuff is really complex and as you 

3922
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:03,520
said,
there's a thousand different things that

3923
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:05,120
can interact.
So you gotta really take that stuff with

3924
02:22:05,121 --> 02:22:06,050
a grain of salt.
Like okay,

3925
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:07,510
does smoking cause cancer?
Yeah.

3926
02:22:07,640 --> 02:22:08,760
Got that.
You know.

3927
02:22:09,110 --> 02:22:10,100
But like yeah,
it's coffee,

3928
02:22:10,101 --> 02:22:11,030
good or bad.
We just,

3929
02:22:11,060 --> 02:22:14,330
the studies aren't there yet,
but that's different from climate change

3930
02:22:14,360 --> 02:22:16,310
or you know,
a gravity,

3931
02:22:16,350 --> 02:22:17,660
you know,
or is there an round?

3932
02:22:18,230 --> 02:22:18,980
Yeah.
Yeah.

3933
02:22:18,981 --> 02:22:20,180
Those are,
those are stupid.

3934
02:22:21,110 --> 02:22:22,760
So I'm.
Listen man,

3935
02:22:22,820 --> 02:22:23,930
thank you very much for being here.

3936
02:22:23,930 --> 02:22:24,920
I really,
really appreciate.

3937
02:22:24,930 --> 02:22:26,310
It was really good to talk to you.
Is Fun.

3938
02:22:26,640 --> 02:22:28,380
Do you have an audio book out?
A.

3939
02:22:28,381 --> 02:22:29,320
Yeah,
there is an audio book.

3940
02:22:29,490 --> 02:22:31,380
Did you read it?
I have not read.

3941
02:22:31,420 --> 02:22:34,770
Did I read that you read the words that 
are in the audio book version?

3942
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:36,090
Did you,
were you narrating it?

3943
02:22:36,200 --> 02:22:38,040
No.
No I didn't.

3944
02:22:38,100 --> 02:22:39,630
God dammit.
Sorry.

3945
02:22:39,990 --> 02:22:43,390
That they didn't talk.
Man.

3946
02:22:43,750 --> 02:22:46,740
Did they have been really animated and I
hate that when I really.

3947
02:22:46,741 --> 02:22:51,741
When I buy audio books and I know that 
the guy who's reading it doesn't have a 

3948
02:22:51,741 --> 02:22:55,520
fucking single bone in invested in this 
idea that he's saying he's just 

3949
02:22:57,991 --> 02:22:59,370
repeating the words.
Well the guy,

3950
02:22:59,371 --> 02:23:00,990
I'm sure whoever did it was like,
you know,

3951
02:23:01,020 --> 02:23:03,600
totally channeling.
I must've felt it in the astral plane.

3952
02:23:03,601 --> 02:23:04,870
You'd be better if you read it,
man.

3953
02:23:04,871 --> 02:23:05,730
They should have let you do it.

3954
02:23:06,180 --> 02:23:08,520
Why the fuck didn't they let you do?
Just don't push for it.

3955
02:23:08,560 --> 02:23:09,640
Oh No,
I didn't even know.

3956
02:23:09,720 --> 02:23:10,920
You know that part of the.
No,

3957
02:23:11,110 --> 02:23:12,270
I didn't.
I didn't understand.

3958
02:23:12,271 --> 02:23:14,550
Part of the publishing.
Tell people the title again,

3959
02:23:14,690 --> 02:23:18,840
a light of the stars.
Alien worlds and the fate of the earth.

3960
02:23:18,900 --> 02:23:19,330
Don.
Don,

3961
02:23:19,370 --> 02:23:20,100
Don,
Don,

3962
02:23:20,240 --> 02:23:24,090
Don,
your twitter is Adam Frank for why?

3963
02:23:24,091 --> 02:23:25,680
Four?
Because that's the only one.

3964
02:23:25,860 --> 02:23:27,180
Everything else was taken.
So I was just like,

3965
02:23:27,200 --> 02:23:30,810
I got to come up with a six years ago 
when I got on Adam Frank for.

3966
02:23:30,811 --> 02:23:32,340
And do you have an instagram as well?
No,

3967
02:23:32,460 --> 02:23:37,460
no.
I have a facebook author page and 

3968
02:23:37,460 --> 02:23:37,920
website.
A website is Adam Frank Science.

3969
02:23:37,921 --> 02:23:40,470
I think if you just Google Adam Frank.
Thank you Adam.

3970
02:23:40,471 --> 02:23:41,870
We really appreciate it.
So much fun.

3971
02:23:42,240 --> 02:23:43,980
Really Fun.
Bye.
