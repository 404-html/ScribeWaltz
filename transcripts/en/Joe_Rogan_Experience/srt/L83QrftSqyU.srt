1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,500
The joe rogan experience.
That's the thing I was reading a lot of

2
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:04,190
people,
you know,

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,520
that we're sort of deriding the idea
that we're calling him crazy and they're

4
00:00:07,521 --> 00:00:08,300
saying,
you know,

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,133
basically when,
uh,

6
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:09,973
when,
uh,

7
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,400
a Muslim person blow kills a bunch of
people,

8
00:00:13,401 --> 00:00:16,190
we start talking about uh,
the calling them terrorists.

9
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:16,730
When,
uh,

10
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:17,330
when,
uh,

11
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,163
you know,
uh,

12
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,960
a black dude kills a bunch of people,
we start calling them thugs.

13
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:23,390
But when a young white guy starts
killing people,

14
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:26,360
we call the mentally ill and somehow
bats,

15
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,530
there's some inherent hypocrisy.
And then I kind of just think like,

16
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,140
it's,
I was thinking about this last night,

17
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,690
there's,
there's levels of human evil that are so

18
00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:38,030
intense that will we get,
when we approached them,

19
00:00:38,031 --> 00:00:39,920
we just kind of like shut down.
Like,

20
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:41,270
you know,
remember the matrix when they would do

21
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:44,600
like the electronic pulse and all the
machinery would just shut down.

22
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,110
It's like there are levels of human evil
that we get to that are so intense that

23
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:52,130
when we start approaching them,
a thought just drops out and pee and

24
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:55,820
it's all emotion that's left.
And so you can look at somebody like

25
00:00:55,821 --> 00:00:57,590
that and say,
you know,

26
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,300
it's a hypocritical to call that guy
mentally ill or you're fighting against

27
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,650
a feminist cause by not recognizing the
inherent misogyny and his attack.

28
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,370
But really what's happening is something
so much sadder and deeper than either of

29
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:12,260
those things.
It's just like we're living in this

30
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:18,050
insane fucking world where human beings
have some tick in this country more than

31
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:20,510
another countries.
No one can figure out why were they

32
00:01:20,511 --> 00:01:23,600
sometimes once in a while we'll go into
a place and shoot a bunch of people and

33
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:26,540
no one knows why it happens.
And some people say it's because it's

34
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:29,090
mental illness and some people say it's
because of bad parenting.

35
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,160
And some people say it's because of gun
control.

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,020
And some people say it's because of,
you know,

37
00:01:33,021 --> 00:01:38,021
violent video games and violent and MMA
and movies and music and nobody fucking

38
00:01:38,091 --> 00:01:41,300
knows why it's really happening.
And it's so terrifying that we just

39
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,310
start slinging mud at one another.
Trying to,

40
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,390
trying to say,
well it's this,

41
00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:46,220
it's that,
and you're part of the problem by

42
00:01:46,221 --> 00:01:48,980
perpetuating this idea.
And the reality is,

43
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,030
is existence is terrifying and humans
are fucking weird.

44
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:57,170
And once in a while there's this
evolutionary blip that somebody pops out

45
00:01:57,171 --> 00:01:58,540
of their mother with a,
you know,

46
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,800
sort of genetic code ready to murder
people.

47
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:03,800
And I don't think it's because of being
spoiled and maybe it is,

48
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,810
and I don't think it's because of,
you know,

49
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,220
chemical imbalances or maybe it is,
it's just the reality is that's what's

50
00:02:10,221 --> 00:02:15,221
happening is jack the ripper exists in
some 0.001% of human beings.

51
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,570
It's terrifying.
I did the audio book and my book and I

52
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:23,550
wrote an article,
a chapter about Patrice,

53
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,540
and I had to decide in their,
do I do patrice has voice or do I just

54
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,150
do a regular voice?
So in the,

55
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,160
so in when you buy the audio book of my
book,

56
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:33,370
you hear me,
God damn

57
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,990
good.
And I was like,

58
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,060
do I do that with all black people?
Like when I,

59
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,700
when will smith talks?
Do I make him like I did it,

60
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,653
I did it.
It's done.

61
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,390
Well,
patrice is just so big with it.

62
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,830
He's so is,
uh,

63
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,350
you know,
his voice was so big and he was kind of

64
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:53,160
almost have to do it because you heard,
I was telling it on opiate anthony,

65
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:55,350
but the whole thing was that I did a
girl with cerebral palsy,

66
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:57,930
didn't know she had cerebral palsy,
so I was drinking so much and patrice

67
00:02:57,931 --> 00:02:59,250
thought that was fucking hilarious.

68
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,840
And he kept saying,
you alcoholic,

69
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,960
you can't even say if someone disabled
disabled.

70
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,300
That is the worst version.
But it's like if we did do a Joey Diaz

71
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,900
impression,
you have to do it right.

72
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,790
If you're going to say something that
Joey said,

73
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,190
you kind of have to say it again.
Everybody does.

74
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,520
Everybody does.
If they say something as Joey,

75
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:21,190
you don't just say like,
if Ari has a joke,

76
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,200
you know,
like I might say it like as me,

77
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,570
I might tell you all are,
he's got this great new joke,

78
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,271
you know,
about blah,

79
00:03:26,271 --> 00:03:26,591
blah,
blah,

80
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:27,130
blah,
blah.

81
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,250
Except if you're describing already mad,
then you'll do the

82
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,540
mumble.
You can't do that.

83
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,950
What was your will smith voice though?
Um,

84
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,160
same exactly
voice.

85
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,033
Hey,
exactly.

86
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,440
This is coby bryant voice.
I wrote the n word in the book twice and

87
00:03:46,441 --> 00:03:47,880
I was as white people saying it.

88
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,210
I didn't realize it because I didn't
fucking really pay much attention to the

89
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:54,030
editing of it.
I just wrote them and then if,

90
00:03:54,031 --> 00:03:57,030
if the publisher liked them,
I was in and I was like,

91
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,200
I read it and I was like,
Oh shit,

92
00:03:58,201 --> 00:04:01,140
I've got to say the m word.
It's thinking for history.

93
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:04,980
I'll go down as saying the word and
despite whether or not I've ever said

94
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:07,020
it,
no one's got me on record saying it.

95
00:04:07,021 --> 00:04:09,540
So I called my buddy Omar Dorsey,
who's on a,

96
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,040
he's on eastbound and down.
I was like,

97
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,560
Hey,
can you come and read a passage of my

98
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:14,394
book?
And he's like,

99
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,233
Oh,
I'd be honored.

100
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,310
Oh my God.
So passage,

101
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,000
what's the word?
Oh,

102
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,790
you did.
Am I supposed to do this?

103
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:28,730
Like a white person?
I go pose how good that way he did it.

104
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,830
He's like,
you know,

105
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:31,690
I love you.
If I'm getting you out of this one

106
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,970
own up to it.
In the book itself,

107
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,370
an audio book itself,
you would say,

108
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,620
well,
there's a question,

109
00:04:40,621 --> 00:04:43,330
we'll word in this passage.
So I brought in a good friend.

110
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,600
I do.
I'll do

111
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,310
16 hours to read my own audio book.
I was like,

112
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,130
oh my God,
I cannot read out loud to save my life.

113
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:53,740
Yeah.
