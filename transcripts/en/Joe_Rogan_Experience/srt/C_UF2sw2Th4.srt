1
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,180
Yes,
yes.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,360
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by the fleshlight,

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:09,770
our first sponsor.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,310
It's been so long. It's the best
thing to fuck Joe. Nowadays.

5
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:16,470
I think I've come to the conclusion
it is no more girls for you.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,930
It's just now it's not the best sex toy.
It's the best thing.

7
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:19,980
That fuck period I think.

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,510
Wow, that's sad dude. Sorry to hear that.

9
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,350
If you go to [inaudible] dot net
and entering the code name Rogan,

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,540
you could save yourself 15% off the
number one sex toy for men. Right.

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,730
And then for one still it's a number
one for everything and it won't give you

12
00:00:34,731 --> 00:00:39,290
any drama and we'll give you an
live drama. Nope. Hmm. All right.

13
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,150
We're also sponsored by on a.com that's
so o n n I t, makers of Alpha brain,

14
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,660
the cognitive enhancing supplement that
I will be giving Chell son and at the

15
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:51,560
end of this interview because
I suspect he will enjoy it. Uh,

16
00:00:51,561 --> 00:00:54,590
if you are interested in nootropics,
I suggest just Google it.

17
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,510
Go to go to Google and typing in the
word nootropic and aerobic and what they

18
00:00:59,511 --> 00:01:02,870
are essentially as nutrients that
enhance brain function. And a,

19
00:01:02,871 --> 00:01:05,610
there's a lot of interesting studies on
them and there's a lot of controversy on

20
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,850
him. So make up your own mind
about it. But if you're interested,

21
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,690
please do your homework first.
Then once you've done that,

22
00:01:11,691 --> 00:01:14,780
if you're interested in Alpha brain,
the way we have it set up,

23
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,850
I want to make sure that
nobody ever feels ripped off.

24
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,970
If you order the first 30
pills and you don't like it,

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,170
you don't even have to send it back.

26
00:01:21,171 --> 00:01:24,200
You just say this stuff sucks and you get
a hundred percent money back guarantee.

27
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,860
That's cause I,
I want to,

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,260
it's much more important to me that
people don't feel ripped off than it is to

29
00:01:30,261 --> 00:01:34,220
make money. And all this shit is stuff
that I've used before I ever endorsed it.

30
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,920
And it's all stuff that I've, uh, I've,

31
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:41,030
I've been using nootropics for a long
time now and I'm a firm believer in

32
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:42,260
vitamins and minerals and,

33
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,770
and you can read up all about the various
ingredients that are in Alpha brain on

34
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:51,110
on it. That's o n n I t.com. And go check
that out. Entering the code name Rogan.

35
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,280
Save yourself 10% off any and all
orders. All right, you dirty bitches.

36
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,130
Chael Sonnen is here.
We're going to get down to business.

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,910
We got a Goddamn American hero here folks.
How about some respect?

38
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,380
Hey Joe Rogan podcast by night.

39
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,770
Fucked up worries horse though,
man.

40
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,090
All respect to Roy MacDonald. We need
to get a better copy of that recording.

41
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,580
We can get one.
I'll get one from the UFC.

42
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,090
UFC pulled all the youtube
videos down with in minutes.
Oh, did they really? Yeah.

43
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,230
Well Ladies and gentlemen,
what is your new book called?

44
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,880
Voice of reason you're VIP pass
into enlightenment. Voice of reason.

45
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,290
The Voice of reason written by this
Guy [inaudible] your hair. I'm here.

46
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,450
And by the way,
on that commercial you just gave,

47
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,130
that has gotta be the single greatest
guarantee in the history of fair trade.

48
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,680
You don't even have to send it back.
You just call it your word. You Go,

49
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:49,260
listen man, this isn't working.
And they refund it. That's amazing.

50
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:53,160
We had to make it the first 30 pills,
cause the way we had it set up was,

51
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:55,440
you know, any order, you don't
even have to turn it back.

52
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,080
So then people started selling
it on Ebay. I'm like, all right,

53
00:02:58,081 --> 00:03:01,000
well you can't be that on. Yeah,
it's like the IRS is basically,

54
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:04,480
you're counting on honesty. You're
counting not, it's for oversight.

55
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:06,600
But I like that. I mean I can
tell you from personal experience,

56
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:08,360
I want to do that. I mean,
if it didn't work, I want to,

57
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,920
I want to lie to keep a couple of
pills. And I think honestly, I like it.

58
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,710
That's all. I think if you have
a product and you believe in it,

59
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:16,300
you would want people to
buy it more than once.

60
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:18,490
Especially if it's something
like a vitamin supplement. Sure.

61
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:21,640
So I'm just letting them know you're
going to like it. It's, it fucking works.

62
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:25,180
It's a fascinating little, uh, you
ever get into vitamins, nootropics,

63
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:29,200
anything like that? Yes. Uh, in college
and uh, I was sick all the time.

64
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,140
I was getting sick three times a
month, even if it was for, you know,

65
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:33,790
a day or something. And my mom said, look,

66
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,380
you've got to get started
on a multivitamin.

67
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,830
Do you think this is also
because of wrestling? Like
you just, I think so. Yeah.

68
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:42,100
You're, you're kind of in a good petri
dish for sickness. You're malnourished,

69
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,980
your overtrain and you're not getting
enough sleep with all the road trips in

70
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:48,310
different time zones. Perfect.
Perfect. Petri dish to get ill.

71
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,280
And I started in a multivitamin
known as centrum complete,

72
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:55,540
which has less nutrients than dog food.
That's what my doctor told me.

73
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,720
But it worked for me. Those small
nutrients made a big difference.

74
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:01,960
So when I realized, Geez, I
haven't been sick in a year,

75
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:05,080
then I really started getting involved
and now I want some really good stuff.

76
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:07,700
You can't even buy over the counter.
You've got to have a doctor ordered a,

77
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,600
it's called Husana. It's
very powerful. Uh, you know,

78
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:15,160
4,000 milligrams of vitamin D
goes on and on a u s a n, a, Ooh,

79
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:20,160
sauna. Oussama and it's a combination
of vitamins. What happens?

80
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:24,760
Yeah, something just happened. Some short,
quick blurb. I get it too, but we're back.

81
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,410
Um, combination of vitamin A nation
of vitamins and minerals and it's,

82
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:33,580
you can't get it in a GNC or so you
can't not know. And you know, and again,

83
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,230
let me tell you, okay, most
vitamins are 10% effective,

84
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:41,710
90% marketing. We all know that
about nutrition, GNC type things.

85
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:45,460
The ones that really
work are 10% marketing,

86
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,430
90% goes into the lab and making them.

87
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,990
Now that very statement I just gave you
may in of itself be the marketing that

88
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:55,990
the people have put out. I don't know,
but that's what who's sauna is doing.

89
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,210
You can't buy it. You've
got to order it. Uh,

90
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:02,020
they don't have enough to mass produce
it because it's so potent and effective.

91
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,980
But I have had a number of doctors with,
with, with extensive reading and say,

92
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:09,670
listen, this is the one. So do you have
to, you don't have to have a prescription.

93
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:11,670
You can just order.
Probably not. Yeah, but you,

94
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:14,390
you just got to have a doctor's
office call up and you know,

95
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,980
an 800 a doctor's office has to call
them for you when they got to call it in

96
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:21,250
for you. You know, that's something
they tried to get going, uh, years back.

97
00:05:21,251 --> 00:05:25,060
They tried to label vitamins
as nutraceuticals and then
you were going to have

98
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:28,540
it so that you needed a prescription
to get vitamins, which get,

99
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,650
it gets a little weird,
you know? I mean, I,

100
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,150
I would appreciate a little regulation
so we know exactly what the fuck is in

101
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:35,190
everything because right now it's,

102
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,930
it's a little wild west when it
comes to things like supplements.

103
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,850
But I just think that, uh, having to
go to a doctor to get some vitamin D,

104
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,120
that seems like that's, I don't, I
don't want that. Yeah, no, I hear you.

105
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:50,050
But that comes back to my point that it's,
you know, 10% effective, 90% marketing.

106
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:53,410
You know, how many things that
GNC are made in the same lab,

107
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:56,850
but they're packaged different.
Whoever can get the word out more and,

108
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,100
and I can tell you,
you know,

109
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:02,800
I've tried everything at Gnc on the off
chance that something might work. Um,

110
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:02,970
yeah,

111
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,230
I begged my dad to take me there when
I was 12 years old and whoever the most

112
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,740
muscle guy or whoever, the most
handsome guy, whatever it was,

113
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:12,290
that that attracts you when,
when you're vulnerable at that age.

114
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,341
That's what I'm begging.

115
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:18,070
My Dad had put 40 bucks down and buy me
the protein drink for, so I fall forward.

116
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,540
I mean, people, people always
fall for it, so, you know, yeah,

117
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:24,410
they don't have oversight.
It's, it's trial and error,
but what's not. Yeah. Yeah.

118
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:26,930
What isn't, it is, it is
kinda crazy. But there,

119
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:29,150
there were a few things
that actually did work,

120
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:30,860
but they got rid of him very quickly.

121
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,560
There was one called Mag
10 and it was Sunday.

122
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:37,100
They used to have to go into that little
glass cabinet with the key to open it

123
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:40,670
up. You couldn't even get it out of
the regular video game, right? Yeah.

124
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:43,090
You got to let them know like
you want it some porn, I mean,

125
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:49,050
I mean that's your porn was testosterone
pills and mag 10 was fucking real.

126
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,000
They got rid of it really quick.
You would take an absurd amount of pills.

127
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:55,580
I think it was like 10 pills.
There were these clear pills,

128
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,660
but you would tell you,
I don't know,

129
00:06:56,661 --> 00:07:00,920
who knows what kind of fucking
damage did your liver, but oh my God.

130
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,660
You'd feel like a fucking raging
animal. Yeah. Oh, okay. Great.

131
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,080
Wow. Yeah. I gained a
lot of muscle on it, man.

132
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:12,260
I gained like 10 pounds of muscle on it
and like eight weeks and it was legal.

133
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,640
You could buy at a GNC,

134
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,790
you could do like six to eight week
cycles on it and it was such a steroid.

135
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:20,840
It was so obvious because as soon as
I got off at my Dick would just crash,

136
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,490
my body would crash. I was like,
wow. I was like, wow, this stuff,

137
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,890
even though it's something you buy at Gnc,

138
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:30,220
essentially it's just like
doing a steroid. Sure. So,

139
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:34,650
so essentially they discovered something
that the government had it yet and had

140
00:07:34,651 --> 00:07:36,260
a man and they got it.
And you know that's going on.

141
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:37,670
There's a drug out there right now,

142
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,240
and I shouldn't call it a
drug because it's not, but
it's, it's a natural product,

143
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,940
a known as Kratom.
I don't know if you've heard about this,

144
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:47,270
but it is absolutely an opiate.
It's absolutely a painkiller.

145
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:51,380
And you know those drive through
espresso places that they've got,

146
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:55,310
we've got a place like that in Oregon
and the guy sells kratom and he makes 150

147
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:58,430
grand a year and it's completely legal.

148
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,330
The government has not caught on that.
This is a painkiller.

149
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,880
I mean you get a high, you get
a low, you've got to crash.

150
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:07,910
I got a buddy that's coming
off of painkillers. He got,

151
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,270
he got addicted to the Vicodin and what
he's doing is he's going to buy in this

152
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:13,850
Kratom for $10 a pill.
He buys five,

153
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:17,780
it cost him $50 he goes every Sunday
and when he shows up at 10:00 AM Joe,

154
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,110
there's a line waiting for this stuff.
It's a drug,

155
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,670
but it hasn't been found illegal yet.

156
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,880
And I'm saying that because the story
you just told about being able to buy a

157
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:28,550
steroid over the counter, people are
going to think that's not believable.

158
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,970
That happens all the time. The government
just hasn't caught on yet. Well,

159
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:34,100
they don't know that they
should. Well, I don't,

160
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:39,120
I think going to be able to like when
balco came out with that clear stuff that

161
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:40,940
declare, you know, clear, right? Yeah.

162
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:42,770
It was like somehow or
another they're undetectable.

163
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:47,210
You know how many more of those
or possibly out there. I mean,

164
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:50,840
how hard is it to do something like
that? Sure. Well I wouldn't know,

165
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:53,600
but from what I've told,
and I read about this stuff all the time,

166
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:57,270
is that if you simply get yourself
good chemist, he goes, any changes,

167
00:08:57,271 --> 00:09:01,160
one molecule, one element, and all of
a sudden the strand is something else.

168
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,840
You've got your band list,
you change one molecule,

169
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:05,670
it doesn't fall into that category.

170
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,700
They're looking for things in that
category and they pass, you know,

171
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,980
it's Olympic year and we see this.

172
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,750
Every games where an entire country comes
out looking different than every other

173
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:18,750
athlete, the whole country looks
different. You're like, okay guys,

174
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,090
you're all looked at that.
That way.

175
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:25,140
This whole team has gotten this much
stronger and more shredded and times of

176
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:28,660
picked in everything from track
to pull Volta to, to swim.

177
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,010
Everybody's better from your country.
What are you doing?

178
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:35,400
And that the 10 years later you find out
and it gets added to the banned list.

179
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,480
It gets really creepy when you start
thinking about shit like cycling and you

180
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:42,660
see all these dudes getting convicted
and all these dudes turning on.

181
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,110
I had a friend who was a professional
cycler and he told me everybody was on

182
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:48,180
crazy shit. She said,
they all are. I said,

183
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:52,790
there's no way you can compete at that
level when you're talking cycling as a

184
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,590
professional site. Sure. And I'm thinking,
well, you're talking about, you know,

185
00:09:55,591 --> 00:09:59,400
shooting up on and off of a
regulation. Okay. So we're talking,

186
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:03,380
we're talking cycling like the WWE or any,

187
00:10:03,381 --> 00:10:07,380
any high level cycling, Lance Armstrong
type toward the front. Shit like you,

188
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:10,890
you almost have to be on something
to repeat. Yeah. You know, it's,

189
00:10:10,891 --> 00:10:14,340
it's getting really weird when it comes
to those types of shirts and what about

190
00:10:14,341 --> 00:10:17,820
when a guy gets caught and so then
instead of just going, yeah, listen,

191
00:10:17,821 --> 00:10:20,820
I've got to take my medicine,
he got to bring everybody else down with,

192
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,930
he becomes the tattle and you know, you
know, come on, what's happening here Jose?

193
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:26,760
Because that's the way it works.
She got brought down,

194
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:30,670
you got [inaudible] going to take
your medicine by Jose can Cincos uh,

195
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,310
that whole book and Publishing and
telling how it was really going down.

196
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,480
You know what I mean? That really
cost him people's love. Sure.

197
00:10:38,481 --> 00:10:41,820
Like for his whole life. Yeah. I, that
guy, if you ever read his Twitter,

198
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,790
this is not comfortable.
Right. And I never have, wow,

199
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,090
he's got some dark shit in there,
you know? But what it was like,

200
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:49,830
what he had money and now
that he's got nothing,

201
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:52,160
he knows what people are
really like and you know, it's,

202
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,270
it's pretty dark and it all,
a lot of it.

203
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:57,840
The hate that this guy gets emanates in
the fact that he ratted out his friends.

204
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,870
Sure. I think there's something
to that, you know? I really do.

205
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:04,340
I mean I even as a kid, nobody likes
a tattletale. Nobody likes though.

206
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,720
He was telling the truth.
Yeah,

207
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,920
I did see a lot of stuff that he did
with his book and I did find it to be

208
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:14,640
pretty genuine. I tend to believe a lot of
people go, oh, he's an admitted cheater.

209
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,190
How can you believe it was like, man,
thanks for being pretty candid right now.

210
00:11:17,191 --> 00:11:17,911
I do believe him.

211
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:21,540
Well when we start seeing guys like Mark
Mcguire's shrink down right after he's

212
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,680
done playing,
you know,

213
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:26,850
and then admit that he was on steroids or
you see Barry bonds and how big he got.

214
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:29,230
And then it's almost like, man, how,

215
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,960
how much regulation do we really
need of the human body? You know,

216
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:37,860
what does w what, what the fuck is
wrong with what Barry Bonds did?

217
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,130
What he took something that made
them stronger. You know, it wouldn't,

218
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:43,860
it shouldn't we be interested in
stuff that makes you stronger.

219
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,940
It makes you healthier. When you look at
a guy like Barry bonds, like that guy,

220
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,210
he looks like he was 30 years old. They
got better when he was older, you know,

221
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,710
as a, as a professional
baseball player. That's amazing.

222
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,590
It shouldn't that be something that we
would like look into and say that's a

223
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:57,640
good thing.
You know,

224
00:11:57,641 --> 00:12:01,510
don't you want Roger Clemens
to keep throwing fucking
heat deep into his forties

225
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,080
like why would you want to stop that?
Sure. But don't mix the argument. I mean,

226
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:09,190
of course we love medicine and
advancements and that's wonderful,

227
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:13,450
but if you're talking about rules within
a sport and you want to just keep it

228
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:14,350
out for whatever reason,

229
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:16,330
but if that is the decision
that we're going to keep it out,

230
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,850
well then the guy can't bring it
in and cheat and lie about it.

231
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:21,700
I think that was the debate. But
I hear what you're saying. I mean,

232
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,720
if it is making people
healthier and better than good
for them, and by all means,

233
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:28,810
we should advance knowledge
and technology in that area.

234
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,990
But that doesn't mean that it's okay for
sport that's up to the governing bodies.

235
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,620
Right. But I mean, that's what's
going on in California. They just, um,

236
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,460
recently ruled on testosterone
replacement surgery, or excuse me,

237
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:41,520
a testosterone replacement therapy and,
uh,

238
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,680
also a medical marijuana and they ruled
positive on both those things. Sure.

239
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,090
And if you're, you're doing testosterone
replacement and you know, that,

240
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,690
isn't that essentially the same thing? And
it's essentially the same thing as, uh,

241
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,280
doing, uh, you know,

242
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:56,590
human growth hormone or anything
or anything along those lines.

243
00:12:56,591 --> 00:12:58,900
They're doing something
to stop the aging process.

244
00:12:58,901 --> 00:13:02,500
You're doing something to enhance the
hormonal balance of your body. Well,

245
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:06,430
it's been deemed legal then, so it
shouldn't be an issue. Right. Well,

246
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,920
look, if it's legal or illegal is where
it all comes into play. You know, I,

247
00:13:10,921 --> 00:13:14,110
I can tell you I went through this in
California and they're acting as though

248
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:18,010
they're just made it legal.
That's not true. It's always
been legal here. Uh, their,

249
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:20,340
their commissioners. Did it
always recognize it. You know,

250
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,460
I went through this in California with a,

251
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,150
what was the official designation that
they recently just bestowed on? It would,

252
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:29,340
it would allow a disclosure process here,
let,

253
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:32,890
let me talk about myself because I was
such an expert on this cause I had to go

254
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:35,540
through it. I go out, I tell
him I'm on testosterone. I say,

255
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:38,260
can I compete in your state
while on testosterone? And
that's what you gotta do.

256
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:41,400
You gotta get permission? Yes, go
ahead. So I do it. I take my tests,

257
00:13:41,401 --> 00:13:43,540
they coming back and they say, hey,
you're on testosterone. Well guys,

258
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:47,290
you didn't need a urine test. I told
you that well in advance in writing.

259
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,750
And you told me I could be on
testosterone. They go, well we don't,

260
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,100
we don't like this, but you made the
rules and you told me I could do it.

261
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,790
So it just ended up in this really
weird area where they said, okay,

262
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,010
but you didn't disclose it properly.
And they started changing.

263
00:14:00,011 --> 00:14:03,250
The argument just got really weird too
where we could never narrow him down.

264
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,520
So they finally come to some resolution
within their own body and you know,

265
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,440
in the state of California, and I don't
want to turn on throw stones at them.

266
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:15,070
I want to be pretty diplomatic with
them, but look, they are not transparent.

267
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:20,370
And for you and I to two experts and
authorities in this sport to still not be

268
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:22,780
completely clear on what their ruling was,

269
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,990
I think speaks to their
lack of transparency.

270
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:28,660
And if they don't want people to keep
stubbing their and breaking rules,

271
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,060
just make it clear so that
we know what the rules are.

272
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:32,920
It seems like they're dipping
their feet in the water. To me,

273
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,190
they constantly do that so that
they can then pull back out and go,

274
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:39,400
that's not what we said. Yeah, it
seems tough. It seems weird. Well,

275
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,720
I mean they're in a tough position too.

276
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:43,660
It's a pretty thankless job to be the
head of an athletic commission and there's

277
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:47,470
very few guys that do it and do
it really well. But um, you know,

278
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:49,570
it's not an easy job trying
to figure out what's fair,

279
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,190
trying to figure out what the playing
field is. Especially a science

280
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,680
and medicine advances.
You know,

281
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,120
I liked the idea of a guy
like Roger Clemens being
able to play baseball because

282
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:01,640
he's taking, taking human growth
hormone and doing testosterone.

283
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:02,480
It doesn't bother me.

284
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,460
Like it's really sucks that this guy
that he can't actually just say that he

285
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:12,380
can't just do that. Especially in a sport
like baseball where I mean what, what,

286
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,490
how's it going to hurt somebody? I
mean even if he is enhanced, it's,

287
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:19,640
he's not going to hurt somebody.
That's where it gets weird like an MMA.

288
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,880
That's like the weird, we're the
real questions in MMA. It's like,

289
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:28,070
I mean if you really have something in
your body that makes you like hyper human,

290
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:31,550
you have like hyper human levels,
which people can do if they, you know,

291
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:34,610
if they use testosterone replacement
or something else on ethics.

292
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,340
Sure. You know, I'll tell you
Joe, one thing I admire about you,

293
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,040
you are oddly comfortable
in your own skin. You know,

294
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:44,410
you'd have no problem admitting anything
and being a real open book and, and, and,

295
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,890
and so I think that's one reason why you
can't relate to Roger Clemens is cause

296
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:51,080
a, you know, you're like, look, this
is who I am and this is what I do.

297
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:54,380
But that's a very rare trait. You
possess that. But not a lot of people do.

298
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:57,620
Everybody's got their secrets
not to necessarily on this topic,

299
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,930
but another things of their
life where they keep it private.

300
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,510
I think this is your rare,
this is a weird thing where yeah,

301
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,930
you know, his sport does not
allow you to do that to your body,

302
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:10,380
but I think it's a silly argument when
you're looking at a guy who's an older

303
00:16:10,381 --> 00:16:14,130
man, like he is your like, how else do
you expect him to be able to do that?

304
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,950
Do you know anything about the, how
the body ages? Because guess what,

305
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,210
a certain point in time his body
doesn't recover enough anymore.

306
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,290
He can't throw the heat, but now he
can. He can because he takes this stuff.

307
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,480
Isn't that stuff. It doesn't that
mean it's like good for you, isn't it?

308
00:16:26,481 --> 00:16:27,400
I'm like good for him.

309
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,060
Like shouldn't he be looking at it that
way so that it's such a weird fucking

310
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,560
narrow band of like what is, what
is cheating? You know, what is,

311
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:38,950
what is legal? What do we allow? Well
it's going to be a certain point in time.

312
00:16:38,951 --> 00:16:41,510
Are they going to start genetic
engineering and what do you, what,

313
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,760
what is everybody going to do?

314
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,870
There's going to be a fucking pill
that take and it turns you into Thor.

315
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,330
You know, what are you going to
do? Are you going to not take it?

316
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,350
Why would you not want
to be like a superhero?

317
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:56,440
If I could give you a pill and it lets
you fucking fly through the air and

318
00:16:56,441 --> 00:16:59,400
become bulletproof, you wouldn't
take it. Of course he would take it.

319
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,990
It would be amazing. No, I like
your argument. You know, and again,

320
00:17:01,991 --> 00:17:03,940
it's Olympic year.
Olympics are my favorite sport.

321
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:05,050
I don't watch professional sports,

322
00:17:05,051 --> 00:17:07,090
but I love every four year was
when the games come around.

323
00:17:07,091 --> 00:17:10,180
So you might hear me reference that a
few times today. But you know, listen,

324
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,140
the athletes used to be done at
23 years old. That was 23 was it?

325
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:18,310
If you made 2121, that's usually no, you
know, look at the last games in Beijing.

326
00:17:18,311 --> 00:17:20,530
We had Dara Torres who was 40 years old.

327
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:24,490
We're going to have 40 year old athletes
on our Olympic team this year vying for

328
00:17:24,491 --> 00:17:28,030
metals. And that's a tremendous
compliment to medicine.

329
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,960
That's a tremendous compliment
to technology and what
we're discovering here in

330
00:17:31,961 --> 00:17:34,120
America and abroad.
And then not label it,

331
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:38,530
don't label it as drugs or label it as
cheating. Look at the fucking advancement.

332
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,250
Look at what, what could, what's happened.
Sure. Well, and it's real interesting,

333
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,100
you know, because the only time you're
in hot water as if it's a banned list,

334
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:48,280
but you know, that's junk science
and it changes constantly.

335
00:17:48,281 --> 00:17:51,300
Things that weren't our legal, that
are legal aren't legal, you know,

336
00:17:51,301 --> 00:17:55,230
in testosterone replacement. Boy that's
just got such a, a bullseye on it,

337
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,610
but there's a number of
performance enhancing, uh,

338
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,530
agents that are perfectly legal and a,
you know,

339
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:04,320
you've got to still be within your limits.
Caffeine comes to mind.

340
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:05,160
As a matter of fact,
you know,

341
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:09,420
you want your caffeine levels as high as
you can get prior to competition in my

342
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,780
opinion. You know, I can tell you
for my body that's when I do my best.

343
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,920
But you still gotta be within the law
and there's a lot of things like that.

344
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,020
What's the legal limit? Is like a cup
of coffee. Yeah. Essentially, you know,

345
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,000
if you're in a poor compared to no dose,

346
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:23,730
which is something you can buy
at a local convenience store,

347
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,610
you can take two of them. Is that how
you do it? Do you regulate it that way?

348
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,640
That's how I rate just cause
there's no problems. If you do that,

349
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:33,270
it stays in your system about four hours.
You'll get it within that,

350
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:37,440
but you're fine. But coffee can
vary wildly. It absolutely canyon.

351
00:18:37,441 --> 00:18:38,600
And there there's people that say,

352
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:40,810
and I'll listen to it and
they'll block you an athlete.

353
00:18:40,811 --> 00:18:42,450
A lot of fans don't know this.
When you go in the locker room,

354
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:45,870
you cannot have anything other
than a closed bottle of water.

355
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,230
They want to see you open it and the
reason they're just trying to protect you.

356
00:18:49,231 --> 00:18:52,200
If you go in there with a coffee and I'll
bring in there five hours before your

357
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:53,940
fight, you come in there
with some kind of a drink.

358
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,880
It could have something that you
don't know about. But you know,

359
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,520
I mean the caffeine caffeine
is just one that I mentioned,

360
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,440
but there's a number of
performance enhancing things.

361
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:05,880
And if a guy takes the time and get
surrounded with the right people that look

362
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:09,840
into that, cause often it's overlooked.
But you know, supplements, diet, vitamins,

363
00:19:09,841 --> 00:19:12,510
as we talked about earlier, these
are, this is a very important element.

364
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:17,511
And have a guy inundates himself and
finds where his level should be and he's

365
00:19:17,611 --> 00:19:19,740
legal.
Then he's legal good for him.

366
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,550
And so many people want to point a finger
and say there's something wrong, bad.

367
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:27,390
But there's not. And the
science continually change
continually junk science.

368
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:29,460
You can't get,
you bring five doctors in your jail,

369
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:32,010
you get five different opinions.
And you know what?

370
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:36,360
It's also assuming that nature's fair,
which I think is ridiculous.

371
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,230
There are some people that are fucking
incredible genetics and there's some

372
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:42,940
people that literally can't compete
with them. Absolutely can't.

373
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,730
They just physically can't
compete with them. You,

374
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:49,040
we both know guys who have
been non athletes that have
tried to wrestle or tried

375
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:52,770
to and they just couldn't do it. There's
guys that are born with freak bodies.

376
00:19:52,771 --> 00:19:56,280
You know, there's, there's
guys that are without a doubt,

377
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:00,720
they're gifted genetically. You know what
I mean? That's, that's not fair either.

378
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:04,770
You know, it should we round people
up by genetically, you know, how,

379
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,450
what's their disposition should we,

380
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:09,330
I mean cause if you really want to
look at it like what's fair? Sure.

381
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,240
Like it is not fair that,
you know,

382
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:16,780
you can get a guy like what's his
name? Jonah Hill. Yeah. Right.

383
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:21,240
And a guy like Melvin man of exactly.
Jon Jones.

384
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:26,240
There's no way you can tell me that
those dudes have the the same hand. Sure.

385
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,320
Someone, someone got fucked. Yeah. Yeah.

386
00:20:28,321 --> 00:20:32,110
The guy and the guy that you want to
win is whoever worked the hardest show.

387
00:20:32,111 --> 00:20:35,760
The most dedication has the best
skills and that is a fallacy.

388
00:20:35,761 --> 00:20:40,560
Some guys will be born with a better
skillset than other guys will be able to

389
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:44,250
learn over a lifetime. They just are, you
know, you see it with speed, you see it,

390
00:20:44,251 --> 00:20:46,800
what the ability to jump you see,
and it's just a natural thing.

391
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:50,470
There's some guys that will
take testosterone and still
have a lower level than

392
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:53,380
a guy that was just gifted with
it and you see it all the time.

393
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,550
So I get your point.
Yeah.

394
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:58,510
It's not a fair playing field and the
ideas that your mind can allow you to

395
00:20:58,511 --> 00:21:03,160
overcompensate or to overcome the
disparaging genetics. You know,

396
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:07,690
your mind and strategy is important.
Just as important as being physical.

397
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:11,200
But that's always assuming that big
strong people are dumb. And guess what?

398
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:13,870
A lot of them aren't sure.
A lot of those big, strong,

399
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:17,560
naturally gifted motherfuckers are
also really quick and they think quick.

400
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,410
You know, I mean, look
at a guy like Mike Tyson.

401
00:21:20,411 --> 00:21:23,500
People would always talk about how,
you know, Mike Tyson wasn't bright.

402
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:28,240
My Mike Tyson was a fucking boxing
historian and maybe he wasn't educated,

403
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:33,220
but he figured out the best style
for his body. He figured out how to,

404
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,810
how to break a man down.

405
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:38,410
He figured out how to put up a pace that
other guys just couldn't deal with and

406
00:21:38,411 --> 00:21:41,800
if you could just punch
faster and everybody else
could that no one could fuck

407
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,940
with them. He, he
figured all that. That's,

408
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:48,460
that's there's a intelligence to that
to get excellent at anything requires an

409
00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:49,294
intelligence.

410
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,740
That's what's really scary about a gin
genetically gifted guy versus they could

411
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:54,880
easily be really smart.

412
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:58,240
Bert sugar just touched on that same
topic with Mike Tyson and he said,

413
00:21:58,241 --> 00:22:01,900
he is very smart. He goes, I'm not saying
he's intelligent, I'm calling him smart.

414
00:22:01,901 --> 00:22:04,600
He's very smart and I don't personally
know what the distinction is that he was

415
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:07,720
getting at. I think it meant, you know,
some of the bad decisions that, that,

416
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:11,290
that Tyson made around tech. Have you seen
Tyson, by the way? The show, you know,

417
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:14,560
he's doing this spirit of I heard it's
amazing. Do you know anything about it?

418
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,950
I have. No, nothing gets up and tell
stories. I got to tell you one story.

419
00:22:17,951 --> 00:22:20,530
So let me set the scene real fast.
Dana white went and saw this.

420
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,770
Dana got invited and Mike or Buddy,
so Dana, you know, he's backstage,

421
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:27,370
she's having a great time.
All it is is Mike Tyson goes out,

422
00:22:27,371 --> 00:22:28,270
he's got a microphone.

423
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,510
He tells stories of his life and they've
got to production. So if he says,

424
00:22:31,511 --> 00:22:33,130
you know, Don King and a story, boom,

425
00:22:33,131 --> 00:22:35,500
don king's face pops up behind
them on a big movie screen.

426
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,400
So he's telling this story and he's to
brings up the Robin givens era where you

427
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:42,120
know where he's beaten Robin givens and
he's doing these horrible things to her

428
00:22:42,121 --> 00:22:42,954
and he's going,
listen,

429
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,320
the one thing Robin never told anyone
is that I was seeing her the whole time,

430
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,870
you know, the whole time we
were still seeing each other.

431
00:22:49,871 --> 00:22:53,110
Now he didn't use the word scene.
I'm sure you can fill in the blank,

432
00:22:53,111 --> 00:22:55,330
but he's seen her the whole
time. So he says, you know,

433
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,420
one morning at 1:00 AM I drive
over to Robin givens house,

434
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,570
my mansion that I bought her
that I'm not allowed to go to.

435
00:23:01,571 --> 00:23:02,590
And I'm ringing the doorbell.

436
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:05,800
And this isn't all that uncommon cause
I do this a lot except today she doesn't

437
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,110
come to the door. So he says,
I'm walking around the house,

438
00:23:08,111 --> 00:23:09,010
I'm looking in the windows.

439
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:12,670
About 15 minutes later I see her pulling
up the driveway in a Bentley that I

440
00:23:12,671 --> 00:23:15,670
bought her that I'm not allowed to drive.
So she's driving my car,

441
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:19,060
she's coming to my mansion. It's one in
the morning. She gets out of the car,

442
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,890
she brought someone home with her.

443
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:26,020
So she brought a guy home to see her
into my mansion in my car that I'm not

444
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:28,150
allowed to be at.
And when the guy gets out of the car,

445
00:23:28,151 --> 00:23:33,130
do you want to know who it is?
And on the screen up pop's Brad Pitt.

446
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,060
He was a waiter and she
picked him up that night.

447
00:23:36,061 --> 00:23:39,540
His before he ever made it into the
movies. So Brad Pitt sitting there going,

448
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,190
hey man,
hey buddy.

449
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,070
You know I don't really know much about,
I know who you

450
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,551
are.

451
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:51,551
We joke we were going to watch some TV
man and my Tyson says I could kill you

452
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:56,320
right now. And nobody would. And uh, Tyson
walked away. Then he did the right thing,

453
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,150
got this car and he walked away.
But how great is that story?

454
00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:04,070
That's a great story. Shit, Brad
Pitt, but he gets somewhere,

455
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:07,250
his production crew found an old
picture of Brad Pitt. You know,

456
00:24:07,251 --> 00:24:10,640
some of them are out there where he's in
the chicken suit somewhere in la trying

457
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:14,000
to make it. It was one of those old school
pictures before he ever got his break.

458
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,520
Robyn brought him home to Mike
Tyson's house. Terrifying.

459
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:23,120
That must have been Jesus
k, man. Let's be cool,

460
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:24,500
man.
Isn't it

461
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,720
[inaudible] that someone
can get married to someone?

462
00:24:27,721 --> 00:24:30,720
Just marry someone really rich for a
couple of years and you can just get

463
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:34,830
fucking paid.
You can just get fucking paid.

464
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:39,280
If a girl can do that, a girl can
meet a guy like Mike Tyson truck.

465
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,480
I'm getting Merriam,
manipulate them. Ropa man.

466
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,490
Ride it for a few years
and then just hurried

467
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:49,120
the rewards and in this era of reality TV,

468
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:52,600
we all know when that's happening.
It's just the guy does like do this.

469
00:24:52,601 --> 00:24:56,020
Chris Humphrey really think he was in a
real relationship. I mean, God bless him.

470
00:24:56,021 --> 00:24:57,490
I hate to see that he got his heartbreak,

471
00:24:57,491 --> 00:25:01,750
but I'm watching it from my couch on
a biweekly basis when the girlfriend's

472
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:05,140
forcing me, I'm like, Chris,
this isn't an actual romance man.

473
00:25:05,141 --> 00:25:06,580
This isn't how this works.

474
00:25:06,581 --> 00:25:09,040
Do you really think you're
getting married to Kim here?

475
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,100
I think he thought it was real.
The whole rest of the world's going,

476
00:25:12,101 --> 00:25:15,820
you gotta be kidding me? Well, he
would say insulting shit to her

477
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:19,500
that you should never take from a meat.
You know,

478
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:24,700
he said something and I, I was on a
soup with Joel Mchale, that's his name.

479
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:29,020
Oh yeah. Funny, funny guy, but very
funny guy. And he's got this, um,

480
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:33,700
uh, the sketch they're doing about Kim
Kardashian and Chris Humphreys. He said,

481
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,760
why would you care? You know, he said
something, they're like on the air, like,

482
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,110
why would you care in
a few years from now,

483
00:25:38,111 --> 00:25:41,860
no one's going to care about you
anymore anyway. Oh, you know. Yeah.

484
00:25:41,861 --> 00:25:45,670
And everybody clapped and we laughed
and I cried for fake, for TV,

485
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,210
but for real life. I look
at it and I go, well man,

486
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,450
could you imagine saying that to
your friend the way it can't move?

487
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:55,900
That would be to say to your friend, if
my friend said that to me, I'd be like,

488
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:57,790
bitch, what the fuck am I
doing hanging around with you?

489
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:01,630
I would cut that guy out of my life
instantly cause I'm not capable of saying

490
00:26:01,631 --> 00:26:05,080
something like that. To a friend
and that's accurate, mean spirited,

491
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,430
but it might not even be accurate,

492
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,770
but who the fuck would have figured
out that you'd be able to do what she's

493
00:26:08,771 --> 00:26:12,790
doing right now? That girls making
$60 million, whatever, a year. I mean,

494
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:15,690
it's incredible how you with
what he's going to see that the,

495
00:26:15,691 --> 00:26:19,030
that she's not gonna be able to figure
out how to ride the tide. Maybe she can,

496
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:23,140
maybe she can stupid. She
already dead. Sure. Look what
she did. I mean, it's, look,

497
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:26,320
she's no genius,
but there is genius in what she's done.

498
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,030
This genius in making a living
by just being a person. Yeah.

499
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,920
Slowly. It's very rare. I
mean, you see it all the time.

500
00:26:32,921 --> 00:26:36,070
A America always has to have somebody.
It's usually some famous blonde.

501
00:26:36,071 --> 00:26:39,560
She pulled it off as a, as a Brunette.
You know, she was at your Pam Anderson's,

502
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,570
you're Marilyn Monroe's.

503
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,040
Well she also pulled it off
with them. Fuck table. The

504
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,990
black dude. Yeah. Very powerful. I've
heard that. Get out of here. You heard.

505
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,330
I don't know much about that,
but I, well speaking of Ya,

506
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,520
and it wasn't the gentleman involved, but
you know, Reggie Bush was at the last,

507
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,680
UFC was kind of, Bush has my
car supporting him. Right.

508
00:26:58,681 --> 00:27:00,600
The second he's literally in your car.

509
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,170
I sold my Barracuda and the owner that a,

510
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:07,480
I sold it to sold to Reggie Bush. Well
that sounds like that's his car. You,

511
00:27:07,481 --> 00:27:11,130
you do know how the sale works.
Well, it was my car should say,

512
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,470
I should have phrased it better.
I apology you got me. Uh, he,

513
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,570
I had a 1970 barracuda or wish
them luck with that fucking thing.

514
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,400
We need to be clear.
You've got to,

515
00:27:20,401 --> 00:27:23,610
you've got a lot of tough guys as friends
and I see Reggie Bush rolling around

516
00:27:23,611 --> 00:27:27,510
that common, I go take it back and honor
you. But now that I know it's okay.

517
00:27:27,511 --> 00:27:29,910
It was a fair sale and he's got
the title then. Not only that,

518
00:27:29,911 --> 00:27:34,830
it was Easter Bush hands with him and I
would change hands with him. Yeah, he was,

519
00:27:34,831 --> 00:27:38,850
uh, he was dating Kim Cardiac. And I
know this. Why do I know this? I have no,

520
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:41,850
not who the president of Poland is.
I've no idea.

521
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,600
But yet I know who Kim Kardashian was
dating before she married this other

522
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,560
fellow and I'm doing my best to act
like I barely watch that show. But yeah,

523
00:27:49,561 --> 00:27:52,170
I knew I didn't know it too.
I guess I should be ashamed as well.

524
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,820
Well you are so good at
promoting a online and,

525
00:27:55,821 --> 00:27:57,330
and promoting and interviews.

526
00:27:57,331 --> 00:28:00,300
Have you ever thought about doing some
sort of a limited version of a reality

527
00:28:00,301 --> 00:28:04,920
show? Not too intrusive. I
never had, I appreciate the
compliment. No, I never have.

528
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,221
You know,

529
00:28:05,221 --> 00:28:09,300
reality TV is still pretty new and does
some generations they don't know that.

530
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:14,520
Um, I, you know, I like it. I'm
a big Fan, but uh, you know,

531
00:28:14,521 --> 00:28:17,160
I got asked to do the ultimate fighter,
our reality show in our,

532
00:28:17,161 --> 00:28:21,720
in our industry and I just passed
it. Just want to coach, you know,

533
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,730
I love coaching.
I coach a kid.

534
00:28:23,731 --> 00:28:27,420
See what I didn't want to do is go to
Vegas for five weeks and now with the new

535
00:28:27,421 --> 00:28:32,190
format of live every Friday night
on FX there. It's a 13 week process.

536
00:28:32,191 --> 00:28:35,070
That's what Dominic and your I are
going through. That's a long time.

537
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:39,450
It's a long time. You know the little
thing, chunks of your soul in that place.

538
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,820
For example, I have a dog.
I can't bring them to,

539
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:44,580
what am I going to put them in Vegas?
Is Dana going to get me a yard somewhere?

540
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,340
You know,
it's kind of too much to ask of any,

541
00:28:46,341 --> 00:28:49,570
but I can't go 13 weeks without
the little guy. He'd forget.

542
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,500
Why was the smartest dog?
That's cute.

543
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:58,230
What kind of dogs are cute? It is. Please
say poodle. I love the, I love dog.

544
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,890
He's a rescue dog. He's a
terrier. He's, he's a a mix.

545
00:29:01,891 --> 00:29:06,450
I actually don't know what completely is.
He's a cute dog is what he is.

546
00:29:06,451 --> 00:29:08,040
Three years,
so you wouldn't,

547
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,290
I mean you could get a place you
could rent a place with a yard.

548
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:15,291
I guarantee you he's probably some fancy
schmancy high roller gambler type dude.

549
00:29:15,451 --> 00:29:18,570
That would love to rent his house out
to chill son and for a couple months.

550
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,250
All right,
well well there you go.

551
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:23,610
Then maybe I will coach the reality
show after all you've saved.

552
00:29:23,611 --> 00:29:26,430
That would be fun to watch. I'll tell
you that. Yeah, I appreciate that.

553
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,930
I think there's some,
you know,

554
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,190
I think that show picks up the one
problem I have with the show because there

555
00:29:32,191 --> 00:29:35,160
was some reality TV I like for example,
big brother I got pretty into,

556
00:29:35,161 --> 00:29:38,850
there was this crazy guy in their name
will for one season if you ever wash it.

557
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,070
I'm not seeing any nods.
I'm assuming nobody said he was fantastic.

558
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,220
It's absolutely fantastic cause he'd
go into the dark room and he would just

559
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:46,360
tell the truth. You know, I'm,

560
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,720
I'm going to tell this girl this and I'm
going to stab her in the back on Friday

561
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:52,060
and I have not even in Cleveland, the
bloody mass, you know, it was, it was,

562
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:54,790
he would say these crazy things and
then he would do it and then he won the

563
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:56,470
whole show.
At any rate,

564
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,790
the problem the ultimate fighter
has is they put them in teams,

565
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:04,350
but there is no team. And so,
you know, they'll go have a, uh,

566
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,230
the team will do a fight and if your
team wins, you need to win something.

567
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:10,870
You know, on the apprentice with
Donald Trump, if your team wins, boom,

568
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:13,330
you get a night out to dinner,
you know, or whatever it is.

569
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,430
Are you going to go meet with this guy?
You all get some money.

570
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,550
There's no team concept.
Why am I cheering for my opponent?

571
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,710
I want whoever the toughest guy is.
Well,

572
00:30:20,711 --> 00:30:24,790
there's a my team or their team to lose
and then I want the next toughest guy to

573
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:27,970
lose.
I am in this to win this for myself.

574
00:30:27,971 --> 00:30:31,120
And it's really important that
those guys start to get that. Uh,

575
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,420
and so they either need to do with the
team concept or they need to have a team

576
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,081
reward.

577
00:30:35,081 --> 00:30:37,690
So there's a reason you would cheer for
one side or the other at this point.

578
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:38,524
There's no point.

579
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,230
So they just, just camaraderie
for the sake of camaraderie.

580
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,980
Right. And then as, as the numbers
dwindle down, now all of a sudden, hey,

581
00:30:43,981 --> 00:30:45,780
you were on this guy's team,
now you over here.

582
00:30:45,781 --> 00:30:48,000
And they mix it up and I'm
a supporter of our show.

583
00:30:48,001 --> 00:30:50,070
The last thing I'm trying to do is,
is put down the show.

584
00:30:50,071 --> 00:30:51,930
But I mean from a critical standpoint,

585
00:30:51,931 --> 00:30:55,800
I'd like to see a reason to cheer for
a specific team or just don't even put

586
00:30:55,801 --> 00:30:56,490
them in.

587
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,630
It's just fun because
the guy who's the coach,

588
00:30:58,631 --> 00:31:02,380
I mean especially this one right now it's
going on with Uriah and Dominick Cruz.

589
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:05,290
What I like about is they're constantly
talking shit to each other and it's just

590
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:08,760
another way to try to win. Just another
way to try to win with a team. You know?

591
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:12,940
And people love to be a part of teams,
man, they like to pick team window. So No,

592
00:31:12,941 --> 00:31:17,260
I'm on team mapple you know, people
love that. I'm a, I only get droids,

593
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,840
I'm sure I liked a droid platform.
You know,

594
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:24,400
people love to be on teams for soccer,
but I hear the ice cream sandwiches,

595
00:31:24,401 --> 00:31:27,120
the share. Actually I saw, have you
seen the, what is it? The note? Yeah.

596
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:30,220
It's amazing how easy that
is. Like this big, I love it.

597
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:33,460
How much you want to urinate?
Chell son in jail, son is healthy.

598
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:36,880
That motherfucker drinks water.
Drink a gallon a day.

599
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:40,930
I'm sure Mike Dolce by what? By
the way. Just texted me. Yeah,

600
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,730
go right down there to the left.

601
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:48,280
Mike Dolce who's a fitness expert who
was a former fighter and a professional

602
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:51,220
bodybuilder I think at one point in time
where power lift or something like that.

603
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,920
Super Smart Dude when
it comes to nutrition.

604
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,750
So he's going to come on the podcast
and I'm going to have your diet

605
00:31:56,751 --> 00:32:00,730
straightened down. Canyon mine. I need
to address a certain issues with you.

606
00:32:00,731 --> 00:32:04,030
We're going to get you on all
vegetables from now on and uh,

607
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:07,240
and do some animals last night,
which he,

608
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:11,830
I had foie gras and and s for the only,

609
00:32:11,831 --> 00:32:14,560
for a couple more weeks in California.
I know, but this place I went to,

610
00:32:14,561 --> 00:32:18,310
it was called animal and
I highly recommend it's in
Hollywood and it's just kind

611
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:23,200
of all every single crazy, they had
veal brains. They had, they had,

612
00:32:23,201 --> 00:32:27,290
you know, pig slice, pig head. I don't
even know what that is. My uncle,

613
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:32,230
he used to cook lamb brains. He used to
cook it on the grill with brains taste.

614
00:32:32,231 --> 00:32:35,110
It doesn't seem like a good idea.
He brands, right. I was okay.

615
00:32:35,111 --> 00:32:38,500
It was a really inexpensive, you
know, it was, it's like peasant food.

616
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,400
It was peasant food and then it becomes

617
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,040
slowly, it became like
sort of chic, you know,

618
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:47,410
fascinating that you're eating organs
and brains and stuff like that. But uh,

619
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:52,000
it wasn't the, it's not the best tasting
stuff, but fog wise, that's amazing.

620
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:54,540
Come here, take the her right
before it's about to get band. Yeah.

621
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,890
I took Brian to this place, nor that's
right down the street. And they have a,

622
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:01,800
they have a full law there for
only two more weeks. This mother,

623
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:05,570
he's silly pitches. You silly
liberals. What have you done?

624
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,490
You got rid of the best tasting food.

625
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:11,510
You're going to kill the doc that do you
really care if someone overstuffed this

626
00:33:11,511 --> 00:33:14,840
doc before you kill it? The
you even watched the videos.
They ever see them. Oh,

627
00:33:14,841 --> 00:33:17,240
force feed a doc. They
take the dock, they stick.

628
00:33:17,241 --> 00:33:19,040
It's stupid head under this faucet.

629
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,980
They pour some grain down its
throat and then they pull it off.

630
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:24,590
It takes five seconds and you
think that that's terrible.

631
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:28,320
That's terrible to an animal that you're
going to kill and eat. Really it's,

632
00:33:28,321 --> 00:33:32,450
it takes five, 10 seconds is not
screaming in pain. It's, it's for a human.

633
00:33:32,451 --> 00:33:35,480
It would totally suck to have
of food shoved down your throat,

634
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:39,320
but they have a completely different
capacity, like absorbed grains and stuff.

635
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,980
I mean it makes their, their liver swell
up. It's like it's not good for them,

636
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,980
but it makes delicious food.
Is there a humane way to do it?

637
00:33:45,981 --> 00:33:50,810
Like is there five or 10
seconds a day if that, you know,

638
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,950
it's quick, really quick, man. I've
watched him do it. It's ridiculous.

639
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:56,870
They take the thing, the
the, this is what we do.

640
00:33:56,871 --> 00:33:59,690
We grab him by the neck and you'd stick
its mouth on it and they get sort of

641
00:33:59,691 --> 00:34:01,340
used to it after awhile.
They just,

642
00:34:01,341 --> 00:34:04,580
they just kind of like stat there that
they pump grain down their throat and

643
00:34:04,581 --> 00:34:06,290
then they let them go and then
they're done for the rest of the day.

644
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:08,540
They wander around eventually
they gonna fucking kill them.

645
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,920
I mean that's why they raised him.
I mean he'd say,

646
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:14,150
what are we going to slowly
regulate that away? I mean it's not,

647
00:34:14,151 --> 00:34:15,590
this is not real cruelty.

648
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:20,710
Veal to me is far more cruel and legal
and I'm more attached to veal because

649
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:24,280
it's a mammal. I don't give
a fuck about ducks. You know,

650
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,650
if you'd take a duck and you stick it
in there and you fill it full of grain.

651
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,680
I don't feel bad. I don't
ducks. I don't really like them.

652
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,820
I'm not like a fan of docs. I don't
know how to fail at any birds. I don't,

653
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:37,520
I don't really feel like any
affection for birds, but animals I do.

654
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:41,540
So we can do that for a little baby cows
and bend them up and feed him milk and

655
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,390
keeping the dark and they
never get to move around.

656
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:48,500
Legal fills a tough thing and I'm a,
I really like veal,

657
00:34:48,501 --> 00:34:51,730
but if you see how that's
tough, it is tough. After
that, once you, once you know,

658
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,560
you know, I tend to agree with where
you're at because I'm from the country,

659
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:56,690
I'm from far. I see. And I
see this stuff all the time.

660
00:34:56,691 --> 00:34:59,060
People are just trying to get
by and support their families,

661
00:34:59,061 --> 00:35:03,320
but I am surprised to see you take that
stance. I'm very impressed by that.

662
00:35:03,321 --> 00:35:05,870
I didn't know you had an open mind. I
thought you were. You were narrowed in.

663
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:09,110
I've misread GI Joe. What did you
think? I was like narrowly hippie style.

664
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:14,240
Very liberal. I heard that you
moved to Colorado at one point.

665
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:18,260
What's Joe doing there? That's a, I
told him I don't really, Oh, you know,

666
00:35:18,261 --> 00:35:22,090
that's where I really learned to not like
hippies when I lived in boulder. The,

667
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:27,200
that's when the reality of
the hippie truly set in. You
know? It's like if you're,

668
00:35:27,201 --> 00:35:28,490
if you're around hippies,

669
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:33,200
it least seven out of 10 of them are not
going to have their shit together. Sure.

670
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,890
Seven out of 10 of them are always going
to need to borrow sugar and you know,

671
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,010
send out a 10 and

672
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:42,060
park. Their car breaks down. They
need to borrow yours. They're just,

673
00:35:42,061 --> 00:35:45,420
they just can't quite fucking get
it together. Well, you know, the,

674
00:35:45,421 --> 00:35:49,230
the ECO movements, a tough movement
because if you go all the way with that,

675
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:53,430
if you go all in, you've got to start
killing people. You're anti human, right?

676
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,380
Because the humans,
the only thing that hurts the environment,

677
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,720
the craziest parasite of all time,
right?

678
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,000
We're sucking all the
fish out of the ocean.

679
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,010
They say within like a
hundred or something years,

680
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:04,740
it'd be no more wild fish in the
ocean. I mean, it's incredible.

681
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:08,310
So we're sucking all this and then
we're throwing all our trash in there.

682
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:09,540
So this is gigantic,

683
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,850
like island of floating plastic as big
as Texas in the middle of the Pacific.

684
00:36:14,851 --> 00:36:17,070
And it gets bigger every day.
Mean we're crazy.

685
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:21,270
If you look at us from like if you were
an alien species and you were observing

686
00:36:21,271 --> 00:36:25,920
earth, you believe it. We at
this one thing just fucking
everything up. Wow. Yeah,

687
00:36:25,921 --> 00:36:28,860
for sure. If you really want it to go
eco, you'd have to start killing people.

688
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,420
You'd have to shut down power.

689
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:35,421
Everybody gets a bike either at you take
a bike there or that's it and hopefully

690
00:36:35,431 --> 00:36:37,080
you don't get stuck somewhere north.

691
00:36:37,081 --> 00:36:40,080
He didn't build your stupid house
somewhere where it fucking phrases in the

692
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:43,170
winter. Cause if you did well, guess
what? That's just where you are.

693
00:36:43,171 --> 00:36:44,760
That's where you're going
to be walking around now.

694
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:48,210
And I hope your food supply last I
hope is plenty of animals around you.

695
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,220
You've got to make sure you keep them
coming because you know you don't have

696
00:36:50,221 --> 00:36:53,340
cars anymore.
Stupid cars are bad for the environment.

697
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,770
I'm glad that you recognize
that though. It'd be, you know,

698
00:36:55,771 --> 00:36:58,380
cause I hear this Eco Freako talk
all the time. It's like, you know,

699
00:36:58,381 --> 00:37:01,860
be real careful because you're anti human.
If you know,

700
00:37:01,861 --> 00:37:04,710
if you want to go all the way with that
and most topics that you get passionate

701
00:37:04,711 --> 00:37:05,041
about,
you know,

702
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:08,670
I've got this one that chain himself
to a tree to stop construction,

703
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,140
gets pretty whack on. It's like, you know,

704
00:37:10,141 --> 00:37:13,770
make sure what you recognize you're
turning on us and choosing us over a plant

705
00:37:13,771 --> 00:37:17,770
that, you know, make, make sure that you
at least acknowledge that. Yeah. Well I,

706
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:20,210
you know,
my issue that I've always had with uh,

707
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,420
like people who are not just vegetarians
and vegans but are really kind of

708
00:37:24,421 --> 00:37:29,380
aggressive about it and the way they
fuck with you. Sure. You know, you know,

709
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,870
hey man,
I just want you to reconsider.

710
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,310
I just want you to think about what you're
doing. You're killing life too stupid.

711
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,870
I fucking love plants.

712
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,010
They're beautiful and gorgeous and you
have to kill acres of them every year

713
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:44,160
just to keep your stupid fucking
fat face alive. All right.

714
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:46,200
That's an animal that's rather,

715
00:37:46,201 --> 00:37:50,370
that's a life form that is light your
eating life, you're eating plant life.

716
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:54,210
You know, you can't get by without eating
the life, right? Life eats life, period.

717
00:37:54,211 --> 00:37:55,260
So shut the fuck up.

718
00:37:55,261 --> 00:37:59,010
I got a chapter in my book on this very
topic about cutting down trees and it's

719
00:37:59,011 --> 00:38:02,910
like, listen, the older and bigger
the tree, the better with me.

720
00:38:02,911 --> 00:38:05,190
If you're going to cut it
down, you know, let it go,

721
00:38:05,191 --> 00:38:08,370
let it make some sunlight and let a
couple of new trees pop up. But you know,

722
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,600
that's the way that it works.

723
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:12,680
And we use those trees and we build
our houses and paper and then it's a,

724
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:16,590
it's an absolute necessity, but those are
here for us, not the other way around.

725
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,620
And uh, you know, you hear
these Eco Freekeh is, you know,

726
00:38:19,621 --> 00:38:23,760
of course they only come out when CNN
or some local camera crew is there.

727
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,430
It's often about them not
about the environment.

728
00:38:26,431 --> 00:38:29,820
And that's where a real frustration
comes in. But I hear what you're saying.

729
00:38:29,821 --> 00:38:31,640
You know, in fact, we were talking
about Kardashians a minute ago.

730
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:35,420
Somebody just recently threw flour or
something on her over in England and yeah,

731
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:36,130
she's pressing

732
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:39,400
charges, you know, it's like, hey, there's
other ways to do it. You know, one of the,

733
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,860
anything you do needs to be nonviolent.

734
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,770
If there's anything we learned from
Gandhi or Martin Luther King, it's,

735
00:38:44,771 --> 00:38:48,100
you don't come around using
violence to get your attention.

736
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:51,940
And that's where the Unabomber went
off course when people were a spraying

737
00:38:51,941 --> 00:38:56,680
people's fur coats with red
paint. Sure. You know, I mean,
come on man. Now you now,

738
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:01,180
yeah,
you assaulted someone and this very thing,

739
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:04,070
one of the resources of that
animal's body is now you.

740
00:39:04,071 --> 00:39:07,480
You fucked it up and I ruined it. And
people quit listening to your argument.

741
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:08,710
What you do that list I'm out.

742
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:13,330
They listened to your argument and you
have made that animal's death really kind

743
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:16,160
of worthless now because they're going to
have to throw this coat away cause you,

744
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:20,470
you spray paint in it like a fucking
asshole and it's, it's ridiculous point.

745
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:23,620
Now they're going to have
to go get another one to
replace that one. So, right.

746
00:39:23,621 --> 00:39:26,980
The punishment becomes the crime. I get
it. While the whole thing is stupid,

747
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:31,450
it's stupid to try to enforce your
opinions so, so aggressively with paint,

748
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:34,310
you know, that's a salt. You're
a, you're a fucking asshole.

749
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,960
You'd been asked no matter what side
of the argument you were on. Sure.

750
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:40,600
You pick the side and you went full
asshole with that argument. Well, you, uh,

751
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:43,450
you know, you run out and try
to assault Ted Nugent. You know,

752
00:39:43,451 --> 00:39:46,630
it's like that kind of Shit, you know,
it's like, oh, he likes to shoot animals.

753
00:39:46,631 --> 00:39:50,160
Well, why don't you go down to the
fucking one, go down to the butcher, go,

754
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,900
go down in that place where
a thousand cows a day,

755
00:39:52,901 --> 00:39:56,380
I have to stick their head into a metal
trap and a fucking pissed and slams

756
00:39:56,381 --> 00:40:00,520
through their head. Go after them.
Go, go. What are you saying? You know,

757
00:40:00,521 --> 00:40:02,770
you're saying that we should,
every animal that's ever lived,

758
00:40:02,771 --> 00:40:06,370
she just live forever and take over
the earth. This is stupid, right?

759
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,040
You got to eat some of them. It's the
food chain. It's natural selection.

760
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:10,210
There's no,
there's no way around it.

761
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,960
And unless you want wild predators roaming
around, keeping them populations down,

762
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:16,750
you're going to have to fucking kill them.
So few people understand that.

763
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:21,040
They say they don't understand
how important hunting is
for population control.

764
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:24,370
They don't understand how important
it is for traffic safety. Sure.

765
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,640
The people who don't live in rural
areas don't. I drove home once,

766
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:31,240
I had a Gig in western Massachusetts and
I was living in New York and you have

767
00:40:31,241 --> 00:40:33,520
to drive down,
I forget the name of the Turnpike,

768
00:40:33,521 --> 00:40:37,720
but I had to go 2030 miles an hour cause
deer would just tart in front of the

769
00:40:37,721 --> 00:40:41,790
car in front of the car. I mean,
it was an infestation. I mean,

770
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:45,610
I've never seen anything like it since.
I might've seen two,

771
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:49,600
300 deer and a knife driving down
this road. It losing incredible.

772
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:53,770
Maybe I'm exaggerating. Let's say 50
deal. Let's say 20 dear. If I saw 20 beer,

773
00:40:53,771 --> 00:40:58,150
I'd be shocked. So a lot of fucking
cheer. I saw them all over three dear.

774
00:40:58,151 --> 00:41:00,070
Most people can't relate to that.
You know,

775
00:41:00,071 --> 00:41:02,830
and that's where our votes come from
is the city. And it's like, man,

776
00:41:02,831 --> 00:41:05,530
you've got to listen to these folks in
the country that are dealing with these

777
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:09,340
actual things. Those things can fuck
your car up, man. Real dangerous.

778
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:12,340
People die all the time.
This are fucking wild video.

779
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,500
Recent one of a kid who's on a motorcycle,

780
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:18,700
he's going to 80 plus miles an hour and
he hits a deer and somehow or another he

781
00:41:18,701 --> 00:41:21,760
hits it perfect. Dead on so he
doesn't even lose control of the bike.

782
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,410
He just went boom and the raw,

783
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:29,320
he pulls his bike over and his friend
comes over. He's like, do you go to died?

784
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,340
You could have died.
Did you just see what that,

785
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,960
he goes back and the deer is
just cut in half and you know,

786
00:41:33,961 --> 00:41:37,850
he literally like the deer exploded
on impact. That is amazing.

787
00:41:37,851 --> 00:41:40,340
I have not seen that as absolutely.
I mean I'm glad. Pretty wild.

788
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:44,120
I thought that's what you're going to say.
No, I don't want to even waiver. I mean,

789
00:41:44,121 --> 00:41:48,000
he didn't even lose control. It was like,
like he was, if I ever lost narrowed by,

790
00:41:48,001 --> 00:41:48,920
I didn't have like a saw.

791
00:41:48,921 --> 00:41:52,520
You're saying basically and
at 80 fucking miles an hour,

792
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:57,920
he's the one time speeding.
Saves a motorcyclist and
Iraq. Yeah, no kidding. Yeah,

793
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,150
that'd be interesting to talk to. Talk
to a physicist and he was slowed down.

794
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,760
What would have happened? What have we not
cut it in half? It would have been him.

795
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:08,760
I Dunno, we'll because he hasn't like 80
miles and I was like, oh bullet. You know,

796
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:13,730
just being to run right into that
just probably just exploded. Well,

797
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:18,710
but the kid lived and there was another
video of a guy and it's another helmet

798
00:42:18,711 --> 00:42:22,970
cam. Same thing. And another one where a
guy on a motorcycle hits the, a a deer,

799
00:42:22,971 --> 00:42:25,670
but he loses the bike and he was in,
it was,

800
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,830
he was wearing like
full leathers with pads,

801
00:42:27,831 --> 00:42:31,340
like racing shit where they have like a,
those really hard plates in the money.

802
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:35,270
And he got up and he was fine. And uh,
you know, and it was like telling people,

803
00:42:35,271 --> 00:42:38,090
look, this is the reason why
you need to wear all this shit.

804
00:42:38,091 --> 00:42:41,000
Cause something like this can happen
and this just saved my life. Sure.

805
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:45,140
But it's a you, oh that's a
video. It's about 30 seconds.

806
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:50,010
Zen when he hits the deer.
Wow. See that was, that was it.

807
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,530
Oh you're kidding me. No
back it up a little. Wow.

808
00:42:52,531 --> 00:42:54,930
He does keep control of
that bike. Yeah. Well he,

809
00:42:54,931 --> 00:42:59,070
he's a good fucking rider till you could
totally tell because he didn't lose it

810
00:42:59,071 --> 00:43:02,490
at all. He's a bad motherfucker.
Cause when that deer hits him,

811
00:43:02,491 --> 00:43:03,990
he has a little jiggly moments.

812
00:43:03,991 --> 00:43:08,991
He that and see that little Gigli moment
going 80 fucking miles an hour he hit

813
00:43:09,701 --> 00:43:11,740
to do it. This is the
Admin, the flats. Well,

814
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,540
people, uh, I mean, did this go viral?

815
00:43:13,541 --> 00:43:14,950
That people probably know
what we're talking about here.

816
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:16,570
A lot of people know about this.

817
00:43:16,571 --> 00:43:19,930
Like I got a bunch of tweets about it
and so then his friend comes running over

818
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,040
and they go back to see and
it's just splattered. Well,

819
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:25,540
I assure him glad that guys okay. That,
that would not have been pleasant.

820
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:30,490
I love bikes, but I can't do that. I
can't fuck with crashing. No. You know,

821
00:43:30,491 --> 00:43:34,290
there's something about riding
on something that like, no,

822
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,320
I see that you see the
deer. I took, uh, my, uh,

823
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:42,360
safety lessons and I was ready to get
a bike and I saw one accident and two

824
00:43:42,641 --> 00:43:47,500
friends saw to two other accidents in
the course of like three days involving a

825
00:43:47,501 --> 00:43:52,360
bike. Wow. Yeah. What of them? Someone
like on a phone hit a car or hit a bike?

826
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,550
Just fucking nailed.
It wasn't even paying attention.

827
00:43:54,551 --> 00:43:55,780
Guy Goes flying off the bike.

828
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,690
Another one I'm a friend of mine was
riding through the canyons. He hit some,

829
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:02,800
some salt or some, you know, gravel or
whatever the fuck it was. Lost his bike,

830
00:44:02,801 --> 00:44:04,960
ripped his shoulder apart. And then, uh,

831
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:08,200
it was actually right around the same
time that Frank Mir got hit too when frank

832
00:44:08,201 --> 00:44:11,470
got hit by a car and broke his femur
femur. It was like on his honeymoon.

833
00:44:11,471 --> 00:44:14,890
I think it wasn't real.
I ain't go on his honeymoon vacation.

834
00:44:14,891 --> 00:44:17,200
I know he's on vacation.
He was on his honeymoon.

835
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:19,690
Pretty sure it was in Vegas than it. It
wasn't really. See, I thought it was,

836
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:22,960
I thought it was overseas.
Like The Bahamas. I might be,

837
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:25,570
I might just be adding that element.
I used to be a historian. Joe,

838
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:28,720
you used to not need to consult and
Internet if you had me around I think.

839
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,400
And now they're about so many shows.
I've,

840
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,550
I've lost track thinking about Tito Ortiz.

841
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:37,350
Tito Ortiz was in Jamaica and
he got hit by a bus. Yeah.

842
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,780
Him and his wife on vacation.
That's what happened to frank.

843
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:44,250
Got that frank was hit by a
bus on a motorcycle. No, no,
no. Tito and his, uh, his,

844
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:47,190
I think it was his,
his wife or a,

845
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:50,640
they were hit by a bus when I think
he was on like a moped or some shit.

846
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:54,900
That's why price hurt. That happens, man.

847
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:58,800
There's only so much data. Sure.
Holding your brain after awhile. Those,

848
00:44:58,801 --> 00:45:02,070
those stories get little Squirrley.
Yeah, no. Frank was hit, I think,

849
00:45:02,071 --> 00:45:05,940
like right in Vegas. And uh, some
guy just fucking ran a red light,

850
00:45:05,941 --> 00:45:09,090
slammed right into him and broke his back,
broke his thei,

851
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:13,320
sent him flying through the air and it
took a long time for him to come back.

852
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,910
You know, he's a really impressive
case of a comeback. Yeah. You know,

853
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:20,010
he's gone well because he didn't go
real smooth, you know, smooth it all.

854
00:45:20,011 --> 00:45:23,190
You look at like the branded verified,
they paid it pano fight, you know,

855
00:45:23,191 --> 00:45:26,640
it's like wow. Like where, what happened
to the, you know, the, the former champ,

856
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:31,260
right. What happened to the dynamic frank
Mir that burst onto the scene? You know,

857
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:32,780
they're the one that beat Pete Williams.

858
00:45:32,781 --> 00:45:35,400
Just that crazy barbecue guard I remember,
you know,

859
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,280
frankly it was a beast and so
that, that set him back. Man,

860
00:45:38,281 --> 00:45:41,880
I was a pretty pretty grueling injury.
He's one of my favorite guys.

861
00:45:41,881 --> 00:45:43,290
I really like carrying smart guy.

862
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:46,170
I enjoy frank [inaudible] is
his wife's real nice. You know,

863
00:45:46,171 --> 00:45:49,500
he's a local Vegas guy. He's a great
commentator, Second Amendment Guy.

864
00:45:49,501 --> 00:45:53,790
He's very good. Common tastes better
than the interviews that he cuts.

865
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:57,900
Some days he does an interview on
and people are turned off by him.

866
00:45:57,901 --> 00:45:59,880
They think he's putting out an
attitude or, so I don't see it,

867
00:45:59,881 --> 00:46:02,900
but I read and hear about these things,
but he doesn't do any of that.

868
00:46:02,901 --> 00:46:06,450
He's totally different persona when he's
commentating. And I like that. You know,

869
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,210
if he doesn't, if he doesn't see it,
he doesn't say it. He's pretty fair.

870
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:11,340
He's a smart dude and
he's a very smart dude.

871
00:46:11,341 --> 00:46:14,220
He's a kindle with them all the time.
Was Kinda guys constantly read it.

872
00:46:14,221 --> 00:46:17,730
I've had some really heavy conversations
with Frank Mir and you know,

873
00:46:17,731 --> 00:46:19,880
that's why he's so good at Jujitsu.

874
00:46:19,881 --> 00:46:22,170
He's got so much technique too
because he's like, you know,

875
00:46:22,171 --> 00:46:23,550
he's like an encyclopedia for Shit.

876
00:46:23,551 --> 00:46:26,940
The fact that he caught Noguera
and that Kamora and broke his arm,

877
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:30,600
did Jujitsu world just
exploded when that happened,

878
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:32,310
that Frank Mir not only did it,

879
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:36,060
he did it when Nogueira instigated
the ground game because he hadn't,

880
00:46:36,061 --> 00:46:39,090
Frank Mir hurt and he wanted to finish
him off when that just shows you what a

881
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:40,620
bad motherfucker Frank Mir is.

882
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:45,620
That's crazy that he bested Nogueira on
the ground and finish while while dizzy.

883
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:50,010
I mean that's, if that
guy's not underrated. Damn.

884
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:53,260
That's really fucking impressed.
Oh, he's got his positions for sure.

885
00:46:53,261 --> 00:46:54,880
You and I was cheering
for frank in that fight.

886
00:46:54,881 --> 00:46:56,820
I was happy to see him
when you know as a fan.

887
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:00,060
But I took no pleasure of seeing though
Garrett injured at all like that.

888
00:47:00,061 --> 00:47:02,760
That was a, that was a rough one.
That was a really hard one to watch,

889
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:06,330
but Noguera's back, somebody told me
no gear is booked for a card coming up.

890
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,320
Book for card coming up against
check Congo. Yeah, against Chicago.

891
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:12,780
So he shook it off, you know,
get the Nogueira. I don't
care. I don't know how. Wow,

892
00:47:12,781 --> 00:47:15,240
that's amazing. I mean, how the fuck did,

893
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:17,940
I don't know what they
did to use plates or one,

894
00:47:17,941 --> 00:47:20,640
I don't know how they put it back
together again. That was fast,

895
00:47:20,641 --> 00:47:21,510
but good for them and mirror.

896
00:47:21,511 --> 00:47:24,750
He's going to go fight for the world title
against those Santos who I will never

897
00:47:24,751 --> 00:47:28,890
underestimate again. I under, I thought
dos Santos was dead in the water with,

898
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:29,980
I thought it was

899
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,600
a waste of a fight.
I couldn't believe.

900
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:34,600
I will never underestimate
dos Santos again.

901
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:37,070
He can throw heat, man. He
can throw heat, you know?

902
00:47:37,071 --> 00:47:40,000
And I was really looking forward
to him against Allister. Oh,

903
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:42,920
starring him would've been a very
interesting fight, man. You know,

904
00:47:42,921 --> 00:47:47,921
because Alister such a pure standup guy
and Allister is so good at incorporating

905
00:47:47,961 --> 00:47:51,710
leg kicks and knees and
he's got a real tight guard,

906
00:47:51,711 --> 00:47:55,310
especially now that he's so big, you
know, like, like Kinda like sure hunches,

907
00:47:55,311 --> 00:47:57,260
everything over a protects himself.
Well,

908
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:59,210
he's a dangerous guy
to anybody that has to,

909
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:03,740
it has to enforce a standup strategy if
you want to just go and box with that

910
00:48:03,741 --> 00:48:06,710
guy. He's got so many other tools
other than just boxing, you know,

911
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:11,510
and he's so technical with his attacks.
It's just a, it's socks that he, uh,

912
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:14,180
you know, whatever his
issue was. He's saying,

913
00:48:14,181 --> 00:48:17,780
I think that he got some medication
that some doctor gave him the head

914
00:48:17,781 --> 00:48:21,290
testosterone and then he didn't realize
it and it fucked up his testosterone to

915
00:48:21,291 --> 00:48:24,800
epitestosterone. I don't
know what happened. I don't
know the story behind it,

916
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:28,010
but I guess he's suspended for like nine
months now. Something along those lines.

917
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:30,910
That was interesting. Now that whole
case was interesting and yeah, they all,

918
00:48:30,911 --> 00:48:33,910
let's jump off that topic as quick as we
can. But you know, one thing about that,

919
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,080
he took a substance test.

920
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:40,000
He took for two of them were surprised
test no substance was ever found and he

921
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:41,840
came forward later,
I kind of volunteered head.

922
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:43,690
It looks like I might have
taken some testosterone,

923
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,900
but that wasn't what the test show. The
test didn't show anything. It just said,

924
00:48:46,901 --> 00:48:48,550
hey,
there's something with your TD ratio.

925
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:52,150
Let's try to figure out why this happened.
The media really got paused wrong.

926
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:55,900
Well, here's what you got. Understand
Joe, so I'm really glad you asked this.

927
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:58,170
Here's your t and d. Okay,
here's your fee. Here's your,

928
00:48:58,171 --> 00:49:02,680
he says Mastro's for folks at home,
strong epic test. They're very close.

929
00:49:02,681 --> 00:49:05,320
You know they're usually even one to one.

930
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,650
Some allow commissions allow four to
one or even a six to one difference,

931
00:49:08,651 --> 00:49:10,660
but the reality is most are one to one.

932
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:15,910
Now if your testosterone
went up or if it went down,

933
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:19,960
that gap is your ratio with the same set.
If you're Epi,

934
00:49:19,961 --> 00:49:23,650
testosterone went up or went down.

935
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:27,440
That gap is your ratio.
That's why it's a very disingenuous test.

936
00:49:27,441 --> 00:49:30,040
So when a guy has a TDE that's elevated,

937
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:34,260
the media immediately
assumed that he took his tea.

938
00:49:34,261 --> 00:49:37,930
Could have been in the gutter.
His epi was at the norm and that guy,

939
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:42,290
he could have been unhealthfully low. Now
I understand that, that, oh, designate.

940
00:49:42,291 --> 00:49:44,920
There's no distinction.
It's extremely disingenuous.

941
00:49:44,921 --> 00:49:48,800
You will never find an endocrinologist,
not one in this country. Literally.

942
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:52,780
This is a challenge. You won't
find one no matter how disgruntled,

943
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,590
you won't find one to come
on and tell you that it's a,

944
00:49:55,591 --> 00:49:59,920
it's anything other than a disingenuous
test for testosterone and these

945
00:49:59,921 --> 00:50:02,800
commissions are missing this
left and right really, and it's,

946
00:50:02,801 --> 00:50:04,980
it's absolutely horrible. You
know, in some commissions they'll,

947
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:07,930
they give you just enough
rope to hang yourself. They
say, listen, you're allowed,

948
00:50:07,931 --> 00:50:11,200
go ahead, take testosterone, but make sure
you're within the levels. It's like, no,

949
00:50:11,201 --> 00:50:14,590
wait a minute. That's not how it
works. There's a testosterone level.

950
00:50:14,591 --> 00:50:18,520
You need to figure it out through taking
blood. Well, we can't afford that. Well,

951
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:22,280
you can't tell a guy he can take
testosterone, but he can't elevate it.

952
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:26,380
Financial issues as far as accuracy
of test, you have to understand this.

953
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:31,750
Alister was 14 to one a guy could be
100 to one and still be within the legal

954
00:50:33,681 --> 00:50:34,041
limits.

955
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:39,041
A TDE ratio does not pertain to anything
and you won't find one expert now,

956
00:50:39,321 --> 00:50:41,150
and I didn't say a doctor and it said to,
I said,

957
00:50:41,151 --> 00:50:45,320
an endocrinologist not one expert
to tell you differently. Real.

958
00:50:45,321 --> 00:50:47,890
It's absolute junk science and they can't.

959
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:53,050
It's only your in recognition that
does this. It throws off your TV. Well,

960
00:50:53,051 --> 00:50:55,980
his tea could have been up at, he could
have been down his, he could have vote.

961
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:57,050
You can be dealt with.
Listen,

962
00:50:57,290 --> 00:51:01,340
a guy has every right to manipulate
his testosterone every right.

963
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,590
The question is how did he manipulate it?

964
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:08,710
Did he use a legal substance or an
illegal substance and Alistair's test for

965
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:13,190
them too that were surprised,
showed no substance was found.

966
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:17,110
Now I understand if you want to,
if you and I is for me right here we were.

967
00:51:17,111 --> 00:51:19,400
We're just two guys talking.
We can share our opinion.

968
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,880
But if you're a medium member, if you
sit behind a desk, you wear the suit,

969
00:51:22,881 --> 00:51:24,500
you collect a paycheck
at the end of the night,

970
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:27,410
your your brand in an analyst
by your affiliated network,

971
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:31,250
you can't come out and say that he took
testosterone when the test and it showed

972
00:51:31,251 --> 00:51:33,380
that he was never even accused of that.

973
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:36,740
And you know from Mark Cuban's
tax write off that nobody watches,

974
00:51:36,741 --> 00:51:38,510
those guys could have to
miss the boat anymore.

975
00:51:38,511 --> 00:51:42,530
They took pleasure in coming out an outing
him for something that the commission

976
00:51:42,531 --> 00:51:46,190
ever accused about. ESPN missed
the boat. Everybody got this wrong.

977
00:51:46,191 --> 00:51:47,920
And they were quick to say
that all he's taking tests,

978
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:50,360
well not according to
the test and [inaudible]

979
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:54,120
net it was, I don't think it was
anyone other than boss who was a boss,

980
00:51:54,121 --> 00:51:56,290
was pretty sure that he,

981
00:51:56,370 --> 00:52:00,010
you know, and he, and he's
got his own thing, you know,

982
00:52:00,011 --> 00:52:02,650
boss it with golden glory is
very loyal to Golden Glory,

983
00:52:02,651 --> 00:52:06,820
which I really admire with him.
But man, don't let that crossover.

984
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:08,260
If you're behind that desk,

985
00:52:08,261 --> 00:52:10,840
you got to tell a story the way
it happened and they didn't it,

986
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:14,210
it's hard. You know,
it's hard. I, I have, uh,

987
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:17,300
I've done commentary before for friends
and they didn't like what I said,

988
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:20,390
you know, and then he got mad at
me and I would go, listen man,

989
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:23,720
I have to say what I see and if I see you,
you do,

990
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:26,530
you're doing something and then you
get caught doing that. It's because,

991
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:29,990
I mean I have to say it,
I have to tell people what to look for.

992
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,370
That's what commentary is.

993
00:52:31,371 --> 00:52:35,690
I can't pretend that something different
is happening so that you feel better

994
00:52:35,691 --> 00:52:36,830
about it when you listen to it.

995
00:52:36,831 --> 00:52:39,530
But then the million people hear it or
not getting an accurate account of what's

996
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:40,364
going on.

997
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:45,030
I talked to, we had this conversation,
Joe in a bar, you and I in Boston and,

998
00:52:45,031 --> 00:52:47,900
and you,
you told me a line and I've stolen it.

999
00:52:47,901 --> 00:52:50,520
I've used it all the time cause it's
very accurate where you simply said,

1000
00:52:50,521 --> 00:52:52,230
if you don't see it,
you can't say it.

1001
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:56,190
You can't go out and trying to hype a
fight, go, this guy's standup looks great.

1002
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:59,340
If it doesn't, if it standup, look
shotty, willing to stand up, look shot,

1003
00:52:59,341 --> 00:53:03,030
it's not your job to try to cover
for him as an analyst and a,

1004
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,440
I've taken that with me and now I'm
behind a desk and the suit and I took that

1005
00:53:07,441 --> 00:53:10,980
one line and I've educated other people
to just simply what that one line,

1006
00:53:10,981 --> 00:53:13,210
if you don't see it, don't say it. Okay.

1007
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:18,100
Yeah. You have to let people know what
your real opinion of it is while being

1008
00:53:18,101 --> 00:53:20,760
respectful and that's where people
don't understand. Like just, you know,

1009
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:24,010
if I'm accurate about something,
it's not disrespectful, it's just,

1010
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:25,980
it's just uncomfortable. Yeah. It might be

1011
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,440
uncomfortable for you,
but to label a disrespectful,

1012
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:30,720
you're not saying what I'm saying.

1013
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:33,570
I'm not saying there's anything wrong
with you as a human. I'm saying, you know,

1014
00:53:33,571 --> 00:53:36,090
when you, you, you know, you might
do a technique wrong, you might,

1015
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,980
you might have an opening, you might, it's
not a disrespectful thing, but you know,

1016
00:53:40,981 --> 00:53:43,140
to a lot of fighters,
like it's a,

1017
00:53:43,141 --> 00:53:47,730
your entire identity is wrapped up in,
in what you do.

1018
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,050
But you owe that to the viewer. That's
who's paying to hear you, not the fighter.

1019
00:53:52,051 --> 00:53:54,990
You know, I can tell you I
thought I beat Michael Bisping.

1020
00:53:54,991 --> 00:53:56,790
I thought it was pretty clear.
It's very close.

1021
00:53:56,850 --> 00:54:00,450
You had a different opinion and I never
sent you a text or was upset with it.

1022
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:03,330
You, you, you have your opinion
and when you're on the mic,

1023
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:07,470
it's your job to share that
opinion, you know, um, my opinion,

1024
00:54:07,471 --> 00:54:10,770
but I should clarify that my opinion
actually changed when I watched it again

1025
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:15,370
when I watched it again. I, uh, I thought
your takedowns what a want it. Yeah.

1026
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:17,640
I appreciate, I, you know, I had it
the same way and I'm pretty objective.

1027
00:54:17,641 --> 00:54:20,370
I'm not afraid to go look, I pulled
one out. I shouldn't hard though.

1028
00:54:20,371 --> 00:54:22,870
When you're watching it live,
you know, quite honestly I,

1029
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:26,460
I honestly get a better view of fights
a lot of times from watching it at home.

1030
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:29,070
The experience of watching on
paper you is fucking great.

1031
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,240
I mean they always get to the right angle
immediately. It's never like, you know,

1032
00:54:33,241 --> 00:54:36,630
sometimes I'll look up and you know,
a herb Dean's right in front of me.

1033
00:54:36,631 --> 00:54:39,270
I can't see what's going on or
someone's in a post. I don't,

1034
00:54:39,271 --> 00:54:41,330
I don't know what's going on
in the box. Like when, uh,

1035
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,280
Alan Belcher and who some are,
Paul Harris went at it the,

1036
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:47,730
when they first went to the ground,
I didn't know that Belcher,

1037
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:52,380
he instigated that position from the shot.
You know,

1038
00:54:52,381 --> 00:54:53,850
he's the one that pulled him into the,

1039
00:54:53,851 --> 00:54:55,560
into that position and
I didn't realize it.

1040
00:54:55,561 --> 00:54:58,920
I thought that Paul Harris was diving
on them cause I couldn't quite see what

1041
00:54:58,921 --> 00:54:59,550
was going on.

1042
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:03,510
So you do sometimes get a better view of
a fight from watching it at home. Yeah,

1043
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:07,650
sometimes you get hyped up in the
moment too. It's hard to and off topic.

1044
00:55:07,651 --> 00:55:09,110
But speaking of Belcher,
you know,

1045
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:14,420
Dana gives a fight of the night fight
of the night easily was Alan Belcher.

1046
00:55:15,151 --> 00:55:18,240
You know, Pell Horse is
scary. He's flat out scary.

1047
00:55:18,241 --> 00:55:20,940
Nobody wants to fight him
because if it doesn't go well,

1048
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:23,600
you're going to sit out for six to eight
months. He's going to rip your list.

1049
00:55:23,601 --> 00:55:25,470
Yeah. It can go really, really bad.

1050
00:55:25,471 --> 00:55:28,290
For the folks who don't know anything
about of UFC or Jujitsu and you're just

1051
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:32,660
listening to this podcast, Paul
Harris is uh, one of the weirdest, uh,

1052
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:36,330
like specialists in all
of the UFC because all we,

1053
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:40,260
his number one thing is ripping
guys knees apart. It's terrifying.

1054
00:55:40,261 --> 00:55:44,550
Weird build weird technique.
Hulk looking dude. Yeah, sure.

1055
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:48,780
I've ate and just built like a brick
shit house and just dives on your leg and

1056
00:55:48,781 --> 00:55:53,640
very set apart how horrific the way he
wins. People are screaming in agony.

1057
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:57,780
Yeah. And you know, Alan, when I got Allen
did a great job, I was happy for him.

1058
00:55:58,030 --> 00:56:01,650
See the fire pell Horace went to,
because you know, if his backstory,

1059
00:56:01,651 --> 00:56:03,960
everything he's overcoming,
he's a great story too.

1060
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:07,350
But I'm a huge fan of technique and
Paul Jarvis is techniques not just as

1061
00:56:07,351 --> 00:56:08,011
physical strength.

1062
00:56:08,011 --> 00:56:11,580
His technique is masterful the
way he laces up leg locks on guys.

1063
00:56:11,581 --> 00:56:14,460
The way he hit my Senscio.
I mean the way he lays his him up,

1064
00:56:14,461 --> 00:56:17,970
it's like it's so pure, there's no
fat in that technique. You know,

1065
00:56:17,971 --> 00:56:19,230
I'm a fan of of that,

1066
00:56:19,231 --> 00:56:22,230
but I'm also a fan of a guy like Alan
Belcher just figures out how to deal with

1067
00:56:22,231 --> 00:56:24,160
it. I love, I love that he just

1068
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,040
works specifically with guys like
Dean lister and instead of saying,

1069
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:29,410
well we want to avoid this.
He was like, fuck this.

1070
00:56:29,411 --> 00:56:31,090
I'll go to the ground with this guy.
I don't care.

1071
00:56:31,091 --> 00:56:33,790
I'll go to the ground with them. And I
think he blew his mind by doing that.

1072
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:37,360
I think par is mine. Yeah, he blew mine
when he started going for the twist her.

1073
00:56:37,361 --> 00:56:39,370
I was like,
if he taps Paul horror is,

1074
00:56:39,371 --> 00:56:42,130
this would be the craziest fucking
thing I've ever seen. Yeah, he,

1075
00:56:42,131 --> 00:56:44,830
cause he talked about that
in his interviews leading
up. I'll go to the ground,

1076
00:56:44,831 --> 00:56:47,860
I'll put him in an ankle lock. I
was like, sure how many guys say?

1077
00:56:47,861 --> 00:56:50,170
And then he went out and did it. I
mean, he didn't go for the ankle lock,

1078
00:56:50,171 --> 00:56:52,930
but he went out and did it. He backed up
what he said good for Belcher. You know,

1079
00:56:52,931 --> 00:56:56,800
Belcher said moments, why watch
them and go, you are amazing.

1080
00:56:57,290 --> 00:57:01,600
And on a bad night he's still very good,
but on a good night, that guy's amazing.

1081
00:57:01,601 --> 00:57:04,000
Good for belter. Yeah. And
He's had some tough times,

1082
00:57:04,001 --> 00:57:06,370
you know with is a detached
retina you had for awhile,

1083
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:08,990
which is very scary know to imagine.

1084
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:12,490
I mean you're a professional fighter and
you start to lose your vision because

1085
00:57:12,491 --> 00:57:15,940
of fighting, so they have to repair
your eyeball and then you know,

1086
00:57:15,941 --> 00:57:19,420
you have to have the confidence and the
courage to go back out there and keep

1087
00:57:19,421 --> 00:57:22,990
throwing leather and letting people
punch you in that surgically repaired

1088
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:25,600
eyeball. So he was off
for a long time. I mean,

1089
00:57:25,601 --> 00:57:28,150
you know how hard you have to
work to make up that ground.

1090
00:57:28,151 --> 00:57:31,540
Of those six months you lost. Now you
got another four before you got to work.

1091
00:57:31,541 --> 00:57:34,660
Double Time. Triple time. It's,
it's incredible. Just to catch up.

1092
00:57:34,661 --> 00:57:38,050
How long does it take just to catch up?
Happy to see Belcher doing well? Yeah.

1093
00:57:38,051 --> 00:57:39,430
Oh yeah. It takes, just to get back,

1094
00:57:39,431 --> 00:57:42,010
just to get word and not no
improvement in technique.

1095
00:57:42,011 --> 00:57:45,070
No improvement and conditioning.
Just to dreading catch up.

1096
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:50,220
How long does it take to develop the
wind for a five round fight till like for

1097
00:57:50,441 --> 00:57:54,160
real, like you're rematch with Anderson
Silva that you're, you're training for.

1098
00:57:54,161 --> 00:57:58,530
How long are you in like peak
ridiculous hard training to,

1099
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:00,340
to gear up for a five round fight?
You know,

1100
00:58:00,341 --> 00:58:04,510
the answer I give because it's Mike
is a lifetime. It's a lifetime. I,

1101
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,900
I worked so hard,
you know,

1102
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,920
till I was 23 and finished wrestlin to
go six minutes and it was so difficult to

1103
00:58:11,081 --> 00:58:15,790
go six minutes at that pace of a wrestling
match. Now you know, now 15 months.

1104
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:19,090
Oh my goodness. It's so hard when you
start to break into those 25 minutes.

1105
00:58:19,091 --> 00:58:21,540
I don't know if the human being
is meant to do that. You know,

1106
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:24,010
Saint Pierre keeps taking
a lot of criticism. Well,

1107
00:58:24,011 --> 00:58:27,460
the reality is you're asking
him to do a monumental task,

1108
00:58:27,461 --> 00:58:31,680
which is to go hard for 25 minutes.
It's,

1109
00:58:31,681 --> 00:58:34,030
it's an impossible task to ask somebody.

1110
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:37,690
And there's a saying in boxing
that if you go for the knockout,

1111
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:41,800
you will not win a decision and
you need to make your choice. Now,

1112
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:45,730
if I go for the kill, you know Dan
Henderson Style and you don't get it,

1113
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,240
and then you realize that show guns still
alive and you got to hang out for 25

1114
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:53,260
it's not going to be afraid 25 minutes.
You know, you're crazy. Fight that. Yeah,

1115
00:58:53,261 --> 00:58:55,810
you gotta pace. And a lot of people
go, well Dan Henderson's not in shape.

1116
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:56,643
Well that's not the case.

1117
00:58:56,770 --> 00:59:00,850
Dan Henderson's a human being and human
beings get very tired when they go for

1118
00:59:00,851 --> 00:59:05,290
the kill. So you've got a planet,
right? And George does planet right now.

1119
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:06,640
If you want to see an exciting fight,

1120
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:10,270
shorten the rounds and George will go
crazy. I guarantee it. He did before.

1121
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,500
So you think it's just a matter of the
human body has to work too hard to fight

1122
00:59:14,501 --> 00:59:18,040
at a high clip for five rounds, you
know, 25 minutes. It's just too much.

1123
00:59:18,041 --> 00:59:21,200
There's no nobody sprints for 25 minutes.
How would you have it?

1124
00:59:21,201 --> 00:59:24,010
Would you have it? I always felt like
it's kind of interesting. There's two,

1125
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:25,010
two schools of thought.

1126
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,280
One of them is that MMA is more difficult
than than boxing and maybe the round

1127
00:59:30,961 --> 00:59:34,100
should be in shorter length,
but then the other school of thought is,

1128
00:59:34,101 --> 00:59:38,030
but it takes her a grappler a long time
to get his opponent down to work so hard

1129
00:59:38,031 --> 00:59:41,030
for a takedown and then only have
like five seconds left on the clock.

1130
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:42,710
That sounds, that's
ridiculous. You need, you know,

1131
00:59:42,711 --> 00:59:44,660
a five round at a five minute round.

1132
00:59:44,661 --> 00:59:47,030
At least you take a guy down
within the first couple of minutes,

1133
00:59:47,031 --> 00:59:49,310
you have time to work, you hold
them down, you, you finish them,

1134
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,380
you know you have time to
work. I hear you. But you know,

1135
00:59:51,381 --> 00:59:54,890
the competitor is a no sports
set the rules, it's the fans.

1136
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:56,400
It's an audience that sets the rule.

1137
00:59:56,401 --> 00:59:59,660
So it comes down to meet if you are a
fan as well, you want a fan as well.

1138
00:59:59,661 --> 01:00:03,170
So if you as a fan, I mean taking
yourself out of the equation, what do you,

1139
01:00:03,171 --> 01:00:05,270
when you just subjectively with
all the knowledge that you have,

1140
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,460
what would you think would
be the better format? Well,

1141
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:12,140
it is how I would answer you. Professional
boxing is viewed to be very boring.

1142
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:16,310
So they call boxing, very born on
boxing. So born well that's not true.

1143
01:00:16,311 --> 01:00:20,420
Boxing is fantastic. Go Watch the
amateurs. It's three three minute rounds.

1144
01:00:20,421 --> 01:00:23,600
They throw punches in flurries
nonstop for nine minutes.

1145
01:00:23,601 --> 01:00:25,640
So boxing is very pleasing.

1146
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:30,530
Professional boxing where you're asking
a guy to do 12 rounds at three minutes,

1147
01:00:30,531 --> 01:00:31,960
36 minutes is on pleasing.

1148
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:35,180
Know commentators have developed
this feeling out process.

1149
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:40,070
There is no such thing. It's a unwritten
agreement. You and I are going to go box.

1150
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,590
You and I both know we
can't go 36 minutes,

1151
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:44,780
so I'm going to stand around
and move around a little bit.

1152
01:00:44,781 --> 01:00:46,430
You're going to stand around
and move around a little bit.

1153
01:00:46,431 --> 01:00:50,000
Once we get to round five now
we both can do seven rounds.

1154
01:00:50,001 --> 01:00:50,870
Let's go ahead and fight.

1155
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:54,800
There is no such thing as a feeling out
process in boxing. I boxed for years.

1156
01:00:55,070 --> 01:01:00,070
There's such a thing as
surviving a ridiculous time
frame that's put on you have

1157
01:01:00,471 --> 01:01:04,850
a half of an hour and so if you have a
guy hurt but he's got a good Chin and you

1158
01:01:04,851 --> 01:01:08,150
go for it, you're fucked. You're
screwed. I mean that is the same.

1159
01:01:08,151 --> 01:01:10,820
That doesn't mean you're not going to
find exceptions to the rule. But yeah,

1160
01:01:10,821 --> 01:01:14,570
the basic belief in boxing, and I
believe it too, if you go for the finish,

1161
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,270
you will not win a decision.
Eddie Alvarez does that name ring a bell.

1162
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:21,170
He's over in Balter. Eddie Alvarez
talks about this, you know,

1163
01:01:21,171 --> 01:01:23,630
you've got five rounds, you gotta fight,
how are you going to do it? And he says,

1164
01:01:23,631 --> 01:01:24,560
I don't train for five rounds.

1165
01:01:24,561 --> 01:01:29,150
I trained for two and Eddie Alvarez
was like 32 and two we had an amazing

1166
01:01:29,151 --> 01:01:32,600
record. Any finished guy after guy, but
he also had a totally different approach.

1167
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:34,700
I'm going to go for the kill.
If I don't get it. Yeah,

1168
01:01:34,701 --> 01:01:35,940
I acknowledge I'm in trouble.

1169
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:39,470
It's pretty 32 men that didn't
have an answer for it and I really,

1170
01:01:39,471 --> 01:01:40,940
I really liked when Eddie said this,

1171
01:01:40,941 --> 01:01:43,360
he and I were in Bodog together
and I heard him say that that, oh,

1172
01:01:43,361 --> 01:01:45,800
that's hyperbole. And I started
wanting to know he's serious.

1173
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:50,240
He trains to sprint and finish you and
he does guy after guy and when it doesn't

1174
01:01:50,241 --> 01:01:53,670
work well he's got problems. Melvin
Manhoef I heard you bring him up earlier.

1175
01:01:53,671 --> 01:01:56,240
You know Melville do the same thing.
He's trained for three minutes,

1176
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,550
three minutes of fury.
Well that's one of the things,

1177
01:01:58,551 --> 01:02:03,551
the reasons I love a k one I love watching
high level kickboxing's three rounds,

1178
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:06,720
no big matches or three
rounds. You know, I mean I,

1179
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:11,270
I used to love watching those three
round k one fights because it's about all

1180
01:02:11,271 --> 01:02:13,370
those guys could take the
way they were going at it,

1181
01:02:13,371 --> 01:02:14,570
the clip that they were fighting at.

1182
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:18,770
I mean if you go back and watch like
Jerome Le Banner versus Peter Arts,

1183
01:02:18,771 --> 01:02:20,160
they're just fucking

1184
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:24,020
swinging at each other and they take
turns knocking each other down air.

1185
01:02:24,021 --> 01:02:27,810
It's knocks down the banner with a high
kick and then the banner starches IRTs

1186
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:31,980
with a, with a left hook. Both guys that
just got fucking waylaid on each other.

1187
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,950
They, they kick like you'd swing a
baseball bat. I mean it's just violent.

1188
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:37,050
You know, he's speaking to the
k one at guys that did well,

1189
01:02:37,051 --> 01:02:40,050
what's up with Bob Sapp now these aren't
real fights he's going to do in these

1190
01:02:40,051 --> 01:02:42,840
countries, right? Is the
opponent and on the gang,

1191
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,870
like this guy that hits and
master the bell for five seconds,

1192
01:02:45,871 --> 01:02:47,580
he'll push and ask is a gentleman,
he's a sports.

1193
01:02:47,581 --> 01:02:50,370
He's going to punch somebody after
the bell and less than the back.

1194
01:02:50,371 --> 01:02:53,760
You worked it out. Hey, let me cover up
in the act. Mad about it. I mean, come on.

1195
01:02:53,761 --> 01:02:56,130
That whole thing looks so fucking lazy.
That couldn't be real.

1196
01:02:56,131 --> 01:02:59,700
Bob Sat kits a paycheck. I mean, this
is my opinion, but it doesn't look good.

1197
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:01,020
The whole thing was bad.

1198
01:03:01,021 --> 01:03:04,350
And I think what made it worse was when
Pooja now's he kept hitting them after

1199
01:03:04,351 --> 01:03:08,340
the bell. Like, come on, put
your not going to do that
unless you know this looks,

1200
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,390
this looks awful. It's like when Dan
Severn and in Shannon rich did their, uh,

1201
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:17,370
their work. You know, Dan, come
on man, you're caught on this.

1202
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:19,560
This is brutal.
This is brutal.

1203
01:03:19,561 --> 01:03:23,520
And your interviews after the fact are
worse than the poor job you did in the

1204
01:03:23,521 --> 01:03:26,790
ring at fuller. Pc. That
fine. Oh, you didn't see it.

1205
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:30,480
Do you know how to round off
is from gymnastics? It's a,

1206
01:03:30,481 --> 01:03:34,890
gymnastics is a handspring and you'll
use it to Dan Severn hit one of those in

1207
01:03:34,891 --> 01:03:37,940
the fight. I'll just let you know that
Shannon did something damn separate,

1208
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:42,360
hits a round off in the middle of the
ring and he stumps. Oh God, it was so bad,

1209
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:44,880
Joe. He was silly. And
then after the match,

1210
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:46,830
they do their interviews
and their interview,

1211
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:51,000
Jane Dan Severance cover up of the
work was worse than the work is. Well,

1212
01:03:51,001 --> 01:03:55,260
I was just fortunate to get
over on Shannon rich. He's
such a great competitor.

1213
01:03:55,261 --> 01:03:57,210
You know, Shanna Richie was
never want to fight. Dan Severn,

1214
01:03:57,211 --> 01:03:59,880
who was a former multiple
time world champion, you know,

1215
01:03:59,881 --> 01:04:01,650
absolutely legendary in our sport.

1216
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:05,970
I was just fortunate to have a good
enough training camp to go, wow.

1217
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,070
And you got to stop, man. You got to stop.

1218
01:04:08,071 --> 01:04:10,500
We've all been in the locker room
is Shanna. Rich walks in and says,

1219
01:04:10,501 --> 01:04:14,970
who wants the night off? All Right
Shannon, I guess I'll take it. You know,

1220
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:20,040
this isn't a secret in the industry. Dan
quit, you know, come on, you got caught.

1221
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:22,500
Just call it what it is.
Wow. That's weird. Well,

1222
01:04:22,501 --> 01:04:27,270
he always did a lot of pro wrestling
as well, didn't it? Horribly. I mean,

1223
01:04:27,271 --> 01:04:29,850
he got a stent in the WWE. They just
couldn't use them. They said, look,

1224
01:04:29,851 --> 01:04:34,110
you got to go. Just not entertaining. You
know, he just didn't get it. He couldn't,

1225
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,070
he couldn't work.
You know,

1226
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:39,550
if you watch a Shannon match and
you see how bad he did at PR,

1227
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:44,880
it was so bad. Man. It was so bad. This
was the brilliance of pride. You know,

1228
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:45,210
and,

1229
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:48,720
and I get heat when I talk about Vandelay
and cro cop doing their fake matches.

1230
01:04:48,721 --> 01:04:51,960
But in America, if you're going
to do a pro wrestling match,

1231
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:55,560
both guys will sit in the back and they'll
come up with what they're going to do.

1232
01:04:55,561 --> 01:04:59,520
They call it their spots. Okay, you
do this, then I'll do that. In pride,

1233
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:03,180
what they would do is the promoter
would visit one locker room.

1234
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:05,640
So if you're going to take
on Vandelay or cro cop,

1235
01:05:05,641 --> 01:05:08,010
you know your promoter shows up,
boom,

1236
01:05:08,011 --> 01:05:10,440
here's your 10 grand and here's
how this fight's going to end.

1237
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:14,310
Vandelay isn't privy to that.
So when the guy goes down,

1238
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:18,850
his celebration is genuine because he
doesn't know that the guy got his locker

1239
01:05:18,851 --> 01:05:19,171
room visit.

1240
01:05:19,171 --> 01:05:22,120
It's the same thing with cro cop that
thought one leg cemetery in one lake

1241
01:05:22,121 --> 01:05:25,540
hospital, no cro cop. Your legs
aren't knocking people out.

1242
01:05:25,541 --> 01:05:29,140
The promoter visited the back beforehand.
That's what's not going to.

1243
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:30,550
And then I made this public,

1244
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:33,600
I added these guys cause I don't like
either one of them was ordered to do word.

1245
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:38,350
Absolutely. Some legit knockouts
for sure. For sure. And Cro cop the,

1246
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,260
the second part where he kicked his
head. Yeah, I remember that fight.

1247
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,400
I enjoyed their first fight to win.
Vandelay one,

1248
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:46,400
I think they call it a draw and
draw Vandelay one, you know,

1249
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:48,970
per our scoring system,
you know,

1250
01:05:48,971 --> 01:05:52,000
but as soon as I said also good ridge
and coal and all these guys coming in,

1251
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:56,720
yeah, he's right. There's a
bunch of payoff. Well, there
had to be Takotna again.

1252
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:58,750
I mean, come on. You don't have
to do the cotton and Coleman.

1253
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:02,050
They'd have to put on your Colombel rain
jacket to figure this out. You know?

1254
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:04,960
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

1255
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,900
How come I am 22 and oh in Japan and
can't win to straightened America.

1256
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:13,790
Eddie Bravo.
Bravo got offered by a name

1257
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:17,500
to lose or to twin rather.
Oh. To uh, to beat to Coro.

1258
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:18,940
They were going to have it set up.
So,

1259
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:22,780
but meanwhile it could have been a
double cross where he goes there and he

1260
01:06:22,781 --> 01:06:24,750
thinks to Coro is going to lay down

1261
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:27,850
Carl Beats Shit. That's what we
call the screw job. Finished jet.

1262
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:30,030
The Montreal screw job.

1263
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:33,630
Yeah, there's a word for it
in a professional pool too.

1264
01:06:33,631 --> 01:06:36,990
I think it's a double dump.
They get dumped both ways.

1265
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:39,030
Ah, I see. Is that what it is?

1266
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:43,560
Yeah, because pool has a real hard problem
with that. Let guy like say if I, uh,

1267
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:45,900
if I'm a pool player and you're
a rich guy, I said, listen,

1268
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:48,630
shall I got a fucking game and I
can't go wrong here buddy. I am,

1269
01:06:48,631 --> 01:06:52,680
I am robbing this guy. Come on, let's put
up 500 bucks. So let's make some money.

1270
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:55,110
And uh, I go to him and
I go, listen, let's,

1271
01:06:55,180 --> 01:07:00,000
here's the deal I'm going to lose and
we'll just fucking split this 70, 30,

1272
01:07:00,001 --> 01:07:00,870
and cut it up right now.

1273
01:07:00,871 --> 01:07:05,760
And we've got ourselves a big chunk of
cash and so there's no real match going

1274
01:07:05,761 --> 01:07:06,930
on in the first place.
Sure.

1275
01:07:06,931 --> 01:07:09,990
They had already decided that they're
going to dump and they were going to split

1276
01:07:09,991 --> 01:07:10,824
up this guy's money.

1277
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:14,310
That's him and a friend and got together
and they pretended to be rivals so they

1278
01:07:14,311 --> 01:07:16,320
could gamble and he
would dump to this guy.

1279
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:19,710
I can't fucking make a ball and I know
what's going on. Surely just gossip.

1280
01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:22,080
Typical digs, town
hustle sharing. You know,

1281
01:07:22,081 --> 01:07:26,100
the two of them get together after this
show and split up half his money or 70%,

1282
01:07:26,101 --> 01:07:29,540
whatever they, you know,
agreed upon different guys
from different deals. But it,

1283
01:07:29,541 --> 01:07:32,520
uh, it was always a, a big problem
to the point where they had a,

1284
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:37,470
the only time Vegas allowed them to gamble
and pool ever. They, uh, they set it up.

1285
01:07:37,471 --> 01:07:41,310
So it was one of the big tournament's
and all they did was make the found who

1286
01:07:41,311 --> 01:07:45,150
was the number one guy most least
likely to what 40 to one odds. Okay,

1287
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:49,080
we're all going to let that guy when
we're going to just get to gamble all of

1288
01:07:49,081 --> 01:07:50,190
our money and fucking

1289
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:54,780
pay. Right. Allegedly alleged. Well,
that's unfortunate that happened. I mean,

1290
01:07:54,781 --> 01:07:57,990
I can see where that would happen.
That is unfortunate because in, in,

1291
01:07:57,991 --> 01:08:01,690
in some weird walk of society that
is sport that does involve timing and

1292
01:08:01,691 --> 01:08:04,980
accuracy and training. So it's
unfortunate when guys what it is yet.

1293
01:08:05,010 --> 01:08:08,400
But I think I get it. I mean, I, I guess
I understand that. I can understand.

1294
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,280
I can understand betting on yourself.

1295
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:13,640
I can understand if you're
some wild motherfucker like
Bernard Hopkins, he says,

1296
01:08:13,641 --> 01:08:16,340
I'm going to go bet $100 a
hundred dollars on myself,

1297
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,100
you know, because that's how much
I know I'm going to win this fight.

1298
01:08:19,101 --> 01:08:23,900
I liked that. I don't like the
option of doing it the other way.

1299
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:28,220
Betting on your pending on your mommy
and taking a dive. That's possible.

1300
01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:31,070
You know the fact that you
could get your friend to do it.

1301
01:08:31,071 --> 01:08:34,160
The fact that there have been
unethical dumps before without a doubt.

1302
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:38,110
No doubt about it. I mean, we all know
of him. I don't know if you've ever been

1303
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,990
better on a UFC fight,
but I don't know if you,

1304
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:42,440
if you have it then you wouldn't know
this, but the way it worked, you know,

1305
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,090
in a lot of gambling halls you
would imagine, well, if I show up,

1306
01:08:45,091 --> 01:08:47,070
it's four to one odds
and I put 50 grand down,

1307
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:49,050
I got 50 grand in 41 it
doesn't work that way.

1308
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:51,930
If you go to bed at a sports
book in Vegas on a UFC fan,

1309
01:08:51,931 --> 01:08:53,490
this isn't the same for for everything,

1310
01:08:53,491 --> 01:08:56,100
but for UFC because there's
not enough money coming in.

1311
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:58,170
You can only bet x amount at a time.

1312
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,230
Then they reset the line and
then you've got to bed it again.

1313
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:05,550
I went in and bed on, well I bet on
Henderson when he fought Vandelay.

1314
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:06,420
Now this was a number of years,

1315
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:11,450
I think 2006 could have been 2007 and
they only let me bet 500 Henderson was a

1316
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:14,640
three to one underdogs. I
go 500 505 and I, you know,

1317
01:09:14,641 --> 01:09:18,810
I got to my $3,000 limit and I had
to go to three different casinos.

1318
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:23,400
Now I'm quite sure with the influx of
the sport that it'd be closer to 10,000

1319
01:09:23,401 --> 01:09:25,620
but I'm quite sure it's not over 10

1320
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:28,290
how confident were you though?
That's pretty fucking bad ass.

1321
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:31,700
Just going to casino casinos.
The header says it was good

1322
01:09:32,110 --> 01:09:34,330
and you know, that's what vanity,
I mean nobody could meet van.

1323
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:37,330
He had that reputation like Mike Tyson
was, was hanging onto for a while.

1324
01:09:37,331 --> 01:09:39,100
You know,
but you're talking about Dan Henderson,

1325
01:09:39,101 --> 01:09:42,760
you're talking about one of the baddest
dudes to ever live. He's a fucking tank.

1326
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:45,820
He's something else, man. And I knew
it was going to be a good fight too.

1327
01:09:45,821 --> 01:09:48,580
I didn't know was going to be walking in
the park. But uh, you got to bet on you

1328
01:09:48,610 --> 01:09:52,900
guy. Yeah, well you know, Henderson
is a fucking tank man. He's a tank.

1329
01:09:52,930 --> 01:09:55,690
He's one of those dudes were you pat them
on the back and it feels like there's

1330
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:59,740
something wrong. Why? Why are you so
dense? Right? Like what the fuck is this?

1331
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:04,340
And he turns around to look at y'all
stim or Limu. His teeth are out.

1332
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:08,650
Hey, what are you doing? You know,
gives you some insult of some sort.

1333
01:10:08,651 --> 01:10:12,490
That's his way of saying
something mean spirited.

1334
01:10:12,491 --> 01:10:15,370
Knock that last for some reason
it's charming when he does it.

1335
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:17,950
That's how I saw him. He goes, did
you get another fucking tattoo?

1336
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:21,700
I got you sound like my mom.
He always,

1337
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:24,290
he always is something
mean as his greedy you.

1338
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,110
This is my favorite Dan Henderson story.

1339
01:10:26,111 --> 01:10:29,770
We were in Caroline's comedy club in
New York and there's this guy that was,

1340
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:32,680
and he wouldn't shut the fuck
up. And I go, listen man,

1341
01:10:32,681 --> 01:10:33,970
if you don't shut the fuck up,

1342
01:10:33,971 --> 01:10:36,850
I don't want to have Dan Henderson and
come over here and hold you down while he

1343
01:10:36,851 --> 01:10:39,820
fucks your girlfriend. The
crowd goes nuts. And Dan goes,

1344
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:43,120
why would I hold them down when
I could just stare him down?

1345
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,890
I'm telling you the fucking place erupted.

1346
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:50,140
The fucking place erupted.

1347
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:54,370
And it was like one of the creepiest
things I ever heard a man say to another

1348
01:10:54,371 --> 01:10:56,890
man ever.
Like you can see the dude,

1349
01:10:57,430 --> 01:11:02,430
the dude just wanted to crawl out
of the room and just hide somewhere.

1350
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:04,210
The feeling of looking over it,

1351
01:11:04,211 --> 01:11:07,360
that fucking savage after he just says
something like that too, and you're like,

1352
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:10,750
oh, let me change. Let me get Outta here.

1353
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:13,980
Well, in Henderson broke etiquette, you
know there's an etiquette men, if one

1354
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:17,100
guys what the girl at one guy's, not
you, you're, you're always wrong.

1355
01:11:17,101 --> 01:11:19,320
You let him slit you let him
look like a hero, you know?

1356
01:11:19,321 --> 01:11:23,070
Then it comes back to you someday.
Well, I think in that situation it was,

1357
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:27,570
there was 350 fucking people
in that crowd. That guy was
a jackass. He was drunk.

1358
01:11:27,571 --> 01:11:30,630
Dan Henderson was there and he was like,
well, I'll shut this fucking dummy up,

1359
01:11:31,030 --> 01:11:32,660
so I like it. It's a pss. Yeah,

1360
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:36,540
essentially like a trumped
my heckler comment,

1361
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:40,770
like I had shut them down
and then Henderson came along
and put the nuclear bomb

1362
01:11:40,771 --> 01:11:44,790
on top of it. Right. You put the age,
but the verbal age Bonolo each borrower.

1363
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:48,930
That's good work by Dan. It was very
good work on the spot like that.

1364
01:11:48,931 --> 01:11:50,550
The best line you could have ever written.
Sure.

1365
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:52,200
I can't write anything creepy than that.

1366
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,560
Why would I hold him down
when I could just stare him?

1367
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:59,570
Now that's a guy has to think like that
in order to have that thought in his

1368
01:11:59,701 --> 01:12:03,600
head in order to be able to
say that verbally. I mean,

1369
01:12:03,601 --> 01:12:05,490
if you're going to be a writer and
you're going to come up with that,

1370
01:12:05,491 --> 01:12:09,870
it might take you six hours alone doing
cocaine and drinking coffee to pretend

1371
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:13,110
you're the type of guy that would think
that way to have that line come out of

1372
01:12:13,111 --> 01:12:16,800
your character's mouth.
Took Dan Henderson one half of one second.

1373
01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:18,240
He just waited.

1374
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:21,790
Well this is the same guy that volunteered
to fight dos Santos three weeks ago

1375
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:25,570
to move up arguably two weekly. You know,
cause truly he's, he's a middle way.

1376
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:29,550
He chooses to fight at light heavyweight.
He doesn't like cutting weight. Right?

1377
01:12:29,551 --> 01:12:33,930
It's a truly be going up to way anyway.
And he's great and he's fucking,

1378
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:37,890
he's an animal. This is
not the, and those guys,

1379
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:42,240
they almost all come from wrestling. The
guys like that Henderson stock. There's,

1380
01:12:42,241 --> 01:12:45,780
there's guys that can push through pain
and then there's wrestlers. There's like,

1381
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:50,580
there's another level of, of mental
strength of the ability to endure.

1382
01:12:50,581 --> 01:12:52,320
And when you were talking about
going through when you were a kid,

1383
01:12:52,321 --> 01:12:54,720
like being malnourished and fucking,
you know,

1384
01:12:54,721 --> 01:12:57,930
traveling on buses and wherever the
hell you're going to these different

1385
01:12:57,931 --> 01:13:01,200
wrestling meets to sleep and not getting
enough sleep and how difficult and you

1386
01:13:01,201 --> 01:13:04,770
had to do schoolwork as well or
how difficult all that is that the,

1387
01:13:04,771 --> 01:13:09,771
the mental toughness that wrestlers
develop from that ridiculous first of all,

1388
01:13:09,841 --> 01:13:12,420
from fucking cutting weight all
the time just to be able to,

1389
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:14,850
people like to feel
good when they compete.

1390
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,280
They like to feel great and
charged up and confident.

1391
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:20,010
I had so many friends when I was
a wrestling that would be like,

1392
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:23,190
there was this kid named Mark Collins
who is a really good wrestler, really,

1393
01:13:23,191 --> 01:13:27,270
really good, but he would, he
would cut down to like 118 pounds.

1394
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:31,140
He was a little guy anyway, but he would
cut down like re maybe I'm exaggerating,

1395
01:13:31,141 --> 01:13:33,030
maybe was like one 20 something years.
We were in high school.

1396
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:38,190
It used to be one 18 they used to be,
but the fucking guy was never happy.

1397
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:41,850
He would always just have this
dour look in his face. Life sucked.

1398
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:46,830
He was just walking around is always
hungry and you know, it's it stunted.

1399
01:13:46,831 --> 01:13:50,790
My friend, Steve's growth,
my friend Steve, all of his
brothers like six foot two,

1400
01:13:50,791 --> 01:13:53,250
six foot one six foot,
big fucking guys.

1401
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:57,860
He's five six because all throughout
high school just fucking dieting, shy,

1402
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:01,770
going through regular wrestling and
then going off to camps and never,

1403
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:06,510
never allowed to like actually eat full
meals for a normal long period of time

1404
01:14:06,511 --> 01:14:11,040
and grow like a normal man. It's like he
essentially grew up impoverished. Right.

1405
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,030
You know? Yeah. And

1406
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:14,620
it's tough. You know, you're talking about
how hard the weight cut is. And for us,

1407
01:14:14,621 --> 01:14:18,970
for our sport of MMA, it's a 24
hour wait. I mean you weigh in,

1408
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:23,230
the show starts 24 hours later in
wrestling. It's a one hour weigh in.

1409
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:26,350
And not only that, Joe,
the national tournament,

1410
01:14:26,351 --> 01:14:30,940
the whole reason you wrestle is a
three day tournament with three ins.

1411
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:34,660
So you weigh in, you do two matches, you
cut weight that night, you weigh in again,

1412
01:14:34,661 --> 01:14:37,950
you do two matches, you cut weight that
night, you come back for the championship.

1413
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:41,140
So, ah, yeah. So I mean you're
talking guys that aren't
sleeping and they're just,

1414
01:14:41,141 --> 01:14:44,680
they're just, they're cut weight nonstop,
boom time to wrestle. I mean it had,

1415
01:14:44,710 --> 01:14:48,340
you know, how do you do it? And it really
is where the rubber meets the road.

1416
01:14:48,341 --> 01:14:53,080
Sometimes the best wrestler off that
had the best season 35 and will not even

1417
01:14:53,081 --> 01:14:56,820
place at the national tournament because
you know where he used to weigh in and

1418
01:14:56,821 --> 01:14:58,180
have 24 hours get on the mat,

1419
01:14:58,181 --> 01:15:02,380
he'd want a dual meet tournament style
one hour away and you're on the mat next

1420
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:03,430
morning.
Weigh in again.

1421
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:04,880
And so is that like um,

1422
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:09,110
indicative of a style of competing like
some guys like Frankie Edgar don't cut

1423
01:15:09,111 --> 01:15:12,440
any weight at all. Other guys is the,
is that the case in wrestling as well?

1424
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:14,480
Like some guys would try to
cut the most amount of weight,

1425
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:18,650
but other guys would think that the best
way to do was be entirely healthy and

1426
01:15:18,651 --> 01:15:21,560
just be natural and deal with
a guy. Yeah. As larger. Yeah.

1427
01:15:21,570 --> 01:15:22,850
You see that all the time,
you know,

1428
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:26,000
and there's some guys that went and they
got a little bit more speed. This guy,

1429
01:15:26,001 --> 01:15:27,650
you know,
he's going to come in the ring at two 20.

1430
01:15:27,651 --> 01:15:30,540
I'm going to come in at two Oh four
but I'm going to be a little bit

1431
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:33,630
faster than him. And that's where
Dan Henderson's made 11. Yeah.

1432
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:37,790
Dan Henderson's beat multiple heavyweight
world champion and one from a big Nog

1433
01:15:37,970 --> 01:15:40,500
to a fade or um,

1434
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:44,210
here's what those are heavyweights. But
he went to use the little bit of speed.

1435
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:48,140
Yes, he absolutely did.
But that was the rematch.

1436
01:15:48,141 --> 01:15:51,080
He fought him in a tournament
called King of rings. Okay.

1437
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:52,880
So that wasn't really MMA.

1438
01:15:52,910 --> 01:15:56,080
Like you weren't allowed to do certain
things like strike on the ground. Right.

1439
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:59,000
There was some stuff that was held back
and you could strike on the ground.

1440
01:15:59,001 --> 01:16:02,060
I want to say was open
palm, you know, open palm,

1441
01:16:02,061 --> 01:16:05,570
like definitely no soccer kicks or pride
rules. But I mean it was considered,

1442
01:16:05,571 --> 01:16:08,960
I considered MMA absolutely fuck Gilbert
Gilbert I but because when you're on

1443
01:16:08,961 --> 01:16:11,660
your feet you can do everything.
It was something about what the take down.

1444
01:16:11,661 --> 01:16:14,030
I believe it was an open palm to the head.
Isn't that crazy?

1445
01:16:14,031 --> 01:16:16,520
When you see like go boss route
and style Pancrase fights.

1446
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:20,720
What a weird fucking hybrid of the two
for folks who don't know you were allowed

1447
01:16:20,721 --> 01:16:22,070
to kick with,

1448
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:26,090
you know you have these like boots on
that had shin pads on them but you weren't

1449
01:16:26,091 --> 01:16:27,380
allowed to punch the face.

1450
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:32,120
Instead you could slap people full blast
and Bas Rutten figured out a way at a

1451
01:16:32,121 --> 01:16:36,530
pull his hand back way far and when
he would throw slop, I don't know,

1452
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,900
I can't even bend my hand
back the way he would do it.

1453
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:42,870
And he would essentially be punching you
with his palms. Yeah, the palm strike.

1454
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:47,870
He got so good at just punching, throwing
like punching techniques in the palms.

1455
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:49,400
Whereas everybody else had kind of like,

1456
01:16:49,610 --> 01:16:52,180
they hadn't figured that out yet and
they were slapping each other was about a

1457
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:54,900
boss as a master. I love to watch
of bosses, little fights over there.

1458
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:57,010
Some of those were for Gazy to you,

1459
01:16:57,011 --> 01:16:59,780
but you know some of that paint cray stuff
you'd want us to go, no, wait a minute.

1460
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:03,320
Come on. No doubt. No doubt. There was
definitely some, some fixed fights.

1461
01:17:03,650 --> 01:17:06,800
It's weird that some guys don't want to
admit that, but now I think they should.

1462
01:17:06,801 --> 01:17:10,040
I think they kind of owe it to history.
You know, we, we know that there was a lot

1463
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,650
of real fights for sure, but there was
all, there was no question about it.

1464
01:17:12,651 --> 01:17:14,330
There was some that are a little funky,
you know.

1465
01:17:14,331 --> 01:17:18,020
But that goes back to the point I made
earlier that both guys aren't necessarily

1466
01:17:18,021 --> 01:17:20,570
in on it in Japan, Cro, cop,

1467
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:23,620
those guys really think they want
and if you tell them they did it,

1468
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,000
I mean you're talking about really
hurting a guy's feelings where he gets a,

1469
01:17:26,001 --> 01:17:28,490
you know who get fighting
mad a over that and you go,

1470
01:17:28,491 --> 01:17:32,150
hey listen what fights century history.
We'll, we'll, we'll come out and,

1471
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:34,800
and show itself for what it is.
But you know what?

1472
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:38,180
That's really hard because I don't know
all those guys name but cro cop fault.

1473
01:17:38,181 --> 01:17:40,820
One guy that wore a pro wrestling mask,
he is a pro wrestler.

1474
01:17:40,821 --> 01:17:44,650
He wrestles under the name
of via a host. Kairos? Yes.

1475
01:17:44,690 --> 01:17:49,460
A Alberto del Rio is what his name.
But of course you already know that.

1476
01:17:49,461 --> 01:17:52,310
That's what it comes out and says he's
very funny guy and he's talked about it a

1477
01:17:52,311 --> 01:17:53,870
lot. Yeah, they brought me on.
I don't even think about it.

1478
01:17:53,871 --> 01:17:55,360
I got to fight this cro cop.
He's officially,

1479
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:57,350
he's going to throw a head kick and
I got to make it look real. You know,

1480
01:17:57,351 --> 01:18:01,160
he's talked about cro. Cop would be that
you'd be stunned to hear that. I believe.

1481
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:05,060
I believe cro cop did not
know that these were fake. No,

1482
01:18:05,061 --> 01:18:08,690
I didn't have that realization when
I first outed him. I had it. I,

1483
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:11,270
I came to when he responded to that.
You know what?

1484
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:15,320
He's either an academy award winner.
He truly doesn't know.

1485
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:17,560
And then you started to hear for
some other guys when they go look,

1486
01:18:17,561 --> 01:18:19,940
he didn't always know the promoter
to come to your locker room.

1487
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:22,670
So that wrestling guy,
when cro cop kicked him though,

1488
01:18:22,671 --> 01:18:24,860
he really fucking kicked
that guy in the head. Yeah,

1489
01:18:24,861 --> 01:18:26,500
just the guy sort of like just took it.
Yeah.

1490
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:28,280
And the guys just got
to go down in the boom.

1491
01:18:28,281 --> 01:18:30,960
The referee will eating the referee
we led was coming to the man.

1492
01:18:30,990 --> 01:18:34,880
This could be a deal. Is that the
same guy? Wasn't if it was fake,

1493
01:18:34,881 --> 01:18:37,280
what a fucking great
touch. Sure. As the mask.

1494
01:18:37,281 --> 01:18:40,550
If they had like a little blood pack
it there. And what cro cuts slaps it,

1495
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:43,190
blood comes out. I mean what a great
touch that would be. But you know,

1496
01:18:43,191 --> 01:18:46,250
you see a kid come and he'd go, okay, this
is the one I got paid for. You take it,

1497
01:18:46,251 --> 01:18:47,960
it could cause a kick.

1498
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:51,650
I had a buddy that went down and
he was by no means doing a dive,

1499
01:18:51,651 --> 01:18:54,740
he was just ready to quit. He was just,
he just wanted out of there. So you know,

1500
01:18:54,741 --> 01:18:55,221
in fighters,

1501
01:18:55,221 --> 01:18:58,220
we'll do this a lot where something's
not going right and they got it's time to

1502
01:18:58,221 --> 01:19:02,120
go home and you know, they'll usually,
the rear naked choke is the big one for,

1503
01:19:02,121 --> 01:19:03,740
Hey, get me out of here. But uh,

1504
01:19:03,741 --> 01:19:07,030
so my buddy decides that he's going
to go down on a, on a fake knockout.

1505
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:10,250
So we're in code dog and Costa Rica.
Dan,

1506
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:14,240
his guy named Dan Stevens to the big
viking guy used to fight in the UFC a

1507
01:19:14,241 --> 01:19:16,790
couple of times. They didn't Christianson,
is that what his name was? Anyway,

1508
01:19:16,791 --> 01:19:19,580
Dan throws the punch. My Buddy
Jeremiah goes down, the punch,

1509
01:19:19,581 --> 01:19:22,520
missed Jeremiah goes down,
but the referee,

1510
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:26,570
Troy Wa doesn't catch it in time.
So now my buddy who's out cold,

1511
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:29,600
well Dow Dan Christmas is going to come
down for the finish because the ref

1512
01:19:29,601 --> 01:19:32,570
hasn't caught it. So my buddy who's
pretending it has to come back to life.

1513
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:35,720
You guys to come back to life to
like lay there and go for Tkis.

1514
01:19:35,721 --> 01:19:37,520
So when you watch on the replay,
like wait a minute,

1515
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:41,660
I thought you were out called how
come when he came it was pretty bad.

1516
01:19:41,661 --> 01:19:42,411
But you know,

1517
01:19:42,411 --> 01:19:45,650
you see that stuff all the time and
that's not to say the score a sports for

1518
01:19:45,651 --> 01:19:48,470
Gazy, that's just, that's
competition. What you're trying to do,

1519
01:19:48,471 --> 01:19:51,260
what I'm trying to do when I'm
fighting is make the other guy quit.

1520
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:55,670
What he does has to do when he's ready
to quit is make it look like he got,

1521
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:58,730
you know, that's just part of it and
nobody wants to talk about that. In fact,

1522
01:19:58,731 --> 01:20:01,710
one guy did, one guy talked
about it in Ohio and the Ohi,

1523
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,890
I can't think of what his name was,
a former UFC fighter.

1524
01:20:03,891 --> 01:20:06,590
Rashad kicked him in the head. Sean
Salomon. That's what his name is.

1525
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,340
Sean talked about this

1526
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:09,360
and this wasn't my night.

1527
01:20:09,361 --> 01:20:11,130
I gave him an arm and I tapped
out and got out of there.

1528
01:20:11,131 --> 01:20:12,550
He was very keen on there.

1529
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:16,590
He got in canopy because they thought
he was throwing a fit and he's, and he,

1530
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:20,610
but what he was doing was he was letting
people into the psyche of an athlete

1531
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,540
who's breaking,

1532
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,740
he's breaking and it's an ugly deep
secret and we've all done it as athletes,

1533
01:20:25,741 --> 01:20:29,190
whether it's in practice or in the
rain and we're greatly shameful of it.

1534
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:32,580
So what he did is he just let people
know, look, this is what happened.

1535
01:20:32,581 --> 01:20:36,210
I broke down mentally the commissioner
comes out in and suspends him for it.

1536
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:38,880
It's like, well commission obviously
you've never competed. We can,

1537
01:20:38,970 --> 01:20:43,830
we can see that. Yeah. That's ridiculous.
That is what exactly what it is.

1538
01:20:43,831 --> 01:20:44,850
When a guy gives up an arm,

1539
01:20:44,851 --> 01:20:49,680
he's trying to save himself and just say
a little dignity. I got caught. You know,

1540
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:52,110
either. Yeah. That's
that. That is an issue.

1541
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:55,830
The real issue of people
regulating athleticism where
they don't understand the

1542
01:20:55,831 --> 01:21:00,570
psychology behind being an athlete,
especially a combat athlete. You know,

1543
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:04,440
like there was an issue that I had and
we'll, we don't name any names here,

1544
01:21:04,441 --> 01:21:07,500
but it was when you, uh, you,

1545
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:12,530
someone had questioned you about you
fake tapping against a Polo Phelia a law

1546
01:21:15,390 --> 01:21:20,080
and you know,
and my take on that is to,

1547
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:25,340
for you to ask a man what he's
thinking right then in the middle of an

1548
01:21:26,641 --> 01:21:30,360
incredibly emotional situation
where he's losing a fight,

1549
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:31,830
he knows it's over.

1550
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:36,870
He got locked up in it and he's thinking
there's got to be a fucking way out of

1551
01:21:36,871 --> 01:21:41,130
this. There's gotta be a way you want to
win so bad you say something that you're

1552
01:21:41,131 --> 01:21:42,210
ashamed of later.

1553
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:47,250
But to say that that thing
that you were ashamed of,

1554
01:21:47,251 --> 01:21:52,020
it you did represents your character
or your sensibilities or your honesty,

1555
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:56,970
I think is a bit disingenuous to be judged
in that moment. And that vulnerable,

1556
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,150
awful,
devastating moment is not right.

1557
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,730
It's especially for someone who has,

1558
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:07,170
when you have competed at a high level
for a number of years like you have,

1559
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:11,940
it's almost like you could be considered
like almost like a slightly crazy

1560
01:22:11,941 --> 01:22:15,180
person,
like your fanaticism for victory.

1561
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:18,420
You're your need to compete and excel it,
be it.

1562
01:22:18,450 --> 01:22:21,780
The only way to get really fucking
good is you gotta be a little crazy.

1563
01:22:21,781 --> 01:22:24,270
You just have to be and you've
got to want to fucking win.

1564
01:22:24,271 --> 01:22:26,730
You can't be happy with any,
any other result.

1565
01:22:26,731 --> 01:22:30,570
You cannot be hat or you won't
achieve your full potential.

1566
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:33,930
And that sometimes equates
to people fucking up.

1567
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:38,280
It's sometimes equates to breaking.
It equates to mental lapses.

1568
01:22:38,281 --> 01:22:40,950
It equates to a lot of different things.
You know, I had to respond to that.

1569
01:22:41,070 --> 01:22:43,890
I had an uh, a person, again, let's
make sure we keep them on name,

1570
01:22:43,891 --> 01:22:46,980
but he wanted a response to that.
I'm going, Geez, you know, if I'm,

1571
01:22:46,981 --> 01:22:48,030
to be candid with you,

1572
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:53,900
if I get tapped out in front of a sold
out audience that was aired on live

1573
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:58,500
worldwide television,
and I then lie about doing it,

1574
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:02,070
the only person I'm lying to
is myself. You know, that's it.

1575
01:23:02,071 --> 01:23:05,500
They only if I'm trying to fool, so if
I'm in denial, you know, and I, and me,

1576
01:23:05,501 --> 01:23:06,130
I could be anybody

1577
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:09,580
could be chill or it could be, you know,
fight her ex. But if he's doing that,

1578
01:23:09,581 --> 01:23:12,570
if a person, look, Dylan person, you're
lying to yourself to the guy, fall up,

1579
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:16,530
file a complaint with the
commissioner. Well that's
within the rules. Uh, you know,

1580
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:18,940
you know, what did the guy do if you get,
if he's forcing you to make a ruling,

1581
01:23:18,941 --> 01:23:22,570
go ahead. But you know, to like you
said, and let's also not forget one,

1582
01:23:22,571 --> 01:23:24,130
when you file a complaint,

1583
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:28,830
how much of that is gamesmanship because
you're trying to get a rematch anyway.

1584
01:23:28,831 --> 01:23:31,420
And the whole game is about making more
money. I'll tell you what, gentlemen,

1585
01:23:31,421 --> 01:23:34,510
my entire career, I couldn't name one
person that's ever filed a complaint.

1586
01:23:34,511 --> 01:23:35,500
I know they've been filed,

1587
01:23:35,501 --> 01:23:37,590
but I literally couldn't tell
you the one guy that's done.

1588
01:23:37,710 --> 01:23:41,140
And I know some guys think, hey listen,
there was a misapplication of the rules.

1589
01:23:41,230 --> 01:23:43,660
I really like a review and I
understand that. But again,

1590
01:23:43,670 --> 01:23:46,260
I couldn't say state a case for you,
but you know there's,

1591
01:23:46,261 --> 01:23:48,550
there's other things
like the First Amendment,

1592
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:53,200
I've got the right to say I didn't
tap and any single fight that I want.

1593
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:56,260
Okay. The second one, fight ends.

1594
01:23:56,380 --> 01:24:00,940
The marketing for the next fight begins.
And if a fighter chooses to do that,

1595
01:24:00,941 --> 01:24:01,800
he's got everywhere.

1596
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:05,980
There's nothing within the rules of a
commission to say what a guy's going to

1597
01:24:05,981 --> 01:24:09,220
say in his post fight
interview. That's, that's silly.

1598
01:24:09,221 --> 01:24:11,040
So you will say you're,

1599
01:24:11,041 --> 01:24:14,860
you're essentially admitting that you
will say untruthful things just in order

1600
01:24:14,861 --> 01:24:18,160
to keep the hype going and that
people should not miss a turn.

1601
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:22,030
There's a blurry line. Yeah. For
me, no wrestling, blurry line.

1602
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:25,480
I'm not saying that for me, but
you know, if I, if I'm saying me,

1603
01:24:25,481 --> 01:24:27,790
I just meet an athlete in
general and it can be any sport,

1604
01:24:27,791 --> 01:24:32,160
but first I'm an athlete is not under
oath so he can come out and say whatever

1605
01:24:32,161 --> 01:24:36,400
when you're just a person. And
secondly, if one competition is,

1606
01:24:36,401 --> 01:24:39,610
it could be baseball or fighting
or whatever, the, the, the, the,

1607
01:24:39,611 --> 01:24:43,390
the makings and the matchmaking in the
and the shuffling and the politicking for

1608
01:24:43,391 --> 01:24:47,590
the next event begins.
And for somebody to come in and,

1609
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:52,480
and want an answer for that and try
to attempt to regulate you is beyond

1610
01:24:52,481 --> 01:24:55,180
inappropriate. I mean I would, I
would want to say it's illegal. Again,

1611
01:24:55,181 --> 01:24:56,320
it comes down to the first amendment.

1612
01:24:56,321 --> 01:24:59,530
I can say whatever he wants and a post
fight interview or post-match interview

1613
01:24:59,531 --> 01:25:03,220
or game or whatever it is. I want to take
myself out of this now. Right. You know,

1614
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:06,220
person in general come on,
you can say whatever it was naturally,

1615
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:10,120
especially if you're considering
that part of you as a,

1616
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:14,350
as an athlete to be sort of performance
art. You're, you're actually,

1617
01:25:14,351 --> 01:25:16,870
you have an act. I mean, and that act,

1618
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:20,680
it enhances your overall
brand. I mean, when you,

1619
01:25:20,681 --> 01:25:23,470
when you go out there and you talk a
bunch of crazy shit whether or not you

1620
01:25:23,471 --> 01:25:28,150
believe in and people start talking about
you becomes monetarily it advantageous

1621
01:25:28,210 --> 01:25:31,900
to do that, you make more money that way.
Brock Lesnar, I think a perfect example,

1622
01:25:31,901 --> 01:25:35,650
you know, UFC 100 all of his fights, you
know, Brock was always fun to listen.

1623
01:25:35,651 --> 01:25:39,310
Do you want to know who else is fun? Is
Quintin Jackson Quinten finishes a fight.

1624
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:42,790
We all sit there in the living room.
Wait, wait, wait, Quentin's about to talk.

1625
01:25:42,791 --> 01:25:46,870
And he says something funny whether he
gives you a hard time or you on black

1626
01:25:46,871 --> 01:25:50,740
crime and inviting people to an after
party. You know, it's funny. And that's,

1627
01:25:50,741 --> 01:25:52,750
and that's part of the
show that people paid for.

1628
01:25:52,751 --> 01:25:56,260
So that's not to say a fighter or again,
any athlete has to do that.

1629
01:25:56,261 --> 01:25:57,640
But if he chooses to,

1630
01:25:57,970 --> 01:26:02,770
he's gotta be considered outside the
scope of our, the regulatory body.

1631
01:26:02,771 --> 01:26:04,660
I mean about them overstepping

1632
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:06,440
that.
That's beyond an appropriate,

1633
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:11,030
well I certainly think you should be able
to ask a guy after he's fucking taking

1634
01:26:11,031 --> 01:26:13,580
a shower and tell us what happened.
I fucked up.

1635
01:26:13,581 --> 01:26:16,280
I said I didn't tab or I was just
losing my mind in there. Sure.

1636
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:19,110
But even if he doesn't,
if he wants to take it to the gray,

1637
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:22,880
let's not forget the guy doesn't owe
you anything. He's not under subpoena.

1638
01:26:22,881 --> 01:26:26,270
He owes you nothing,
including the truth if that's his choice.

1639
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:27,950
So for a government official,

1640
01:26:27,951 --> 01:26:30,420
cause that's how this started is you
were talking about a government for a

1641
01:26:30,421 --> 01:26:34,250
government official to get involved and
act as though he's going to suspend or

1642
01:26:34,251 --> 01:26:38,660
uphold somebody's license because he
didn't like something that he said in the

1643
01:26:38,661 --> 01:26:41,960
media is inappropriate.
I agree.

1644
01:26:42,410 --> 01:26:47,210
Now what happened to you?
I'm, I'm a, I'm a fascinated,

1645
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:51,940
I'm fascinated personally by
big leaps in development. I'm,

1646
01:26:51,941 --> 01:26:55,400
I'm always fascinated when you
hear about a guy, well yeah,

1647
01:26:55,401 --> 01:26:58,790
he was a blue belt and then something
happened and he went into Q,

1648
01:26:58,830 --> 01:27:00,260
a few seminars and before,
you know,

1649
01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:05,290
he's fucking killing everybody at the
Monday house you went from UFC was at UFC

1650
01:27:06,201 --> 01:27:10,100
60 that you find Jeremy Horn. Yeah.
You were having some tough fights.

1651
01:27:10,340 --> 01:27:13,270
Very impressed that you know that
by the way. Good job pat. Thank you.

1652
01:27:13,271 --> 01:27:17,000
See a lot of shows. Um, I can't
remember where my fucking car keys are,

1653
01:27:17,001 --> 01:27:21,070
but I can tell you a random UFC have
no idea what I put my cell phone. But,

1654
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:22,560
but you,
um,

1655
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:27,580
you fought Jeremy Horn and
then was something happened
between then and when you

1656
01:27:29,151 --> 01:27:33,650
had a resurgence, which
was, um, say what do you,

1657
01:27:33,651 --> 01:27:35,390
what do you attribute your research into?

1658
01:27:35,391 --> 01:27:37,070
Like what year do you
think it's really started?

1659
01:27:37,071 --> 01:27:39,560
I know where you're going with
this and let, let me jump ahead.

1660
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:40,580
You know what you're saying is,
hey,

1661
01:27:40,581 --> 01:27:43,250
I had some major submission problems
and all of a sudden I started submitting

1662
01:27:43,251 --> 01:27:48,010
some guy, not just that man, you
became a more confident guy. You. Um,

1663
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:51,500
I, I don't want to undermine your
confidence before cause I didn't know you.

1664
01:27:51,530 --> 01:27:55,760
I meant uh, I mean the, the way you
presented yourself I should say, um, you,

1665
01:27:55,790 --> 01:28:00,730
you got way better at marketing yourself
and you started fucking dominating Tom

1666
01:28:00,730 --> 01:28:02,700
Fly. It's like you hate
your own. You had a,

1667
01:28:02,701 --> 01:28:05,540
a personal wall and you got
through that fucking thing.

1668
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:09,130
You got through that fucking thing and
you made a big leap, you know, and when,

1669
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:10,520
when you fought Nate Marquardt,

1670
01:28:10,521 --> 01:28:13,910
I think that was the fight that really
opened up a lot of people's eyes.

1671
01:28:13,911 --> 01:28:16,820
Just like, Whoa, like channel
Sonnen's a motherfucker.

1672
01:28:16,970 --> 01:28:19,610
I remember me and Eddie Bravo had
dinner after that and it was like,

1673
01:28:19,790 --> 01:28:22,700
how bout that power double God.
Damn.

1674
01:28:22,850 --> 01:28:25,160
It's like Nate could not keep
you off of them. And we were,

1675
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:28,790
we were thinking about it and was like,
wow, what a nightmare. It's like you had,

1676
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:33,820
you had figured out a way to get all of
your potential out inside the octagon.

1677
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:35,420
What happened?
I appreciate it

1678
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,470
in and out. You don't know
and training either. For me,

1679
01:28:38,471 --> 01:28:41,230
I had a fight with you Chenault calm and
he was ranked number two in the world

1680
01:28:41,231 --> 01:28:44,590
and I was just one of those guys that was
kind of looked at as a top 10 that was

1681
01:28:44,591 --> 01:28:47,140
right before I fought my more, couldn't,
it gave me a lot of confidence.

1682
01:28:47,141 --> 01:28:51,960
But here's what happened Joe. I have
never lost a round of fighting. And,

1683
01:28:51,961 --> 01:28:53,380
and when I say that,
sometimes the guy,

1684
01:28:53,381 --> 01:28:56,950
I'll laugh giggle cause I've lost some
fights but I've never lost around.

1685
01:28:57,080 --> 01:29:01,350
I've never had a fight where a judge ever
scored around against me and tell last

1686
01:29:01,351 --> 01:29:04,230
match with Bisping.
So at the point of your story though,

1687
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:08,010
I sit down one day and I'm looking at it,
I'm sure it all.com I bring myself up.

1688
01:29:08,011 --> 01:29:10,680
I'm looking at my record.
I've won every round I've ever fought.

1689
01:29:10,770 --> 01:29:14,190
I've never been in a tough fight. I've
never had stitches, I've never broken it.

1690
01:29:14,191 --> 01:29:18,480
I've dominated everybody and I've lost
eight fights and I lost all of them by

1691
01:29:18,481 --> 01:29:21,060
submission and I lost all
of them in the second round.

1692
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:23,970
And I'm staring at that on the computer.
I'm staring at these numbers,

1693
01:29:23,971 --> 01:29:26,880
like a CEO would, his
spreadsheet, and I'm saying,

1694
01:29:26,881 --> 01:29:28,980
there's something going on
here and it's not physical.

1695
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,310
There's something going on that I can
dominate eight minutes of a fight,

1696
01:29:32,311 --> 01:29:33,360
seven minutes of a fight,

1697
01:29:33,361 --> 01:29:37,290
nine minutes of a fight and
find a way out time after time,

1698
01:29:37,291 --> 01:29:40,260
after time in the same
round with the same move.

1699
01:29:41,190 --> 01:29:43,230
And so I find I wouldn't get it.
I wouldn't get help.

1700
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:47,850
I went and got professional help and,
uh, I sought out a doctor, ed Versteeg.

1701
01:29:48,270 --> 01:29:48,810
Uh,

1702
01:29:48,810 --> 01:29:52,290
I hate talking about this because this
was a real seat as a real turning point

1703
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:55,950
for me is when I went in, worked on
sports psychology, got hypnotized.

1704
01:29:56,220 --> 01:30:00,030
I was never the same. I was never the same
in practice. My attitude was different.

1705
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:03,360
Uh, controlling my diet, being
disciplined, falling asleep.

1706
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:07,980
The way I approached battle,
the way I approached the second round,

1707
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:09,630
everything changed.

1708
01:30:09,690 --> 01:30:13,620
And it changed to the point where I hate
to say what I just said and now it's

1709
01:30:13,621 --> 01:30:16,860
too late. Uh, because I
felt like it was my secret.

1710
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:19,230
I discovered and I don't
want other people to know.

1711
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:22,330
I'll write about it someday in a
book. I'll talk about it, you know,

1712
01:30:22,430 --> 01:30:26,190
when I'm retired, but I'm not gonna
tell anybody cause its competitive edge.

1713
01:30:26,490 --> 01:30:30,030
And when I started seeing a sports
psychologist, when I finally came clean,

1714
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:33,060
you know, it was like being an
alcoholic before you can get help,

1715
01:30:33,061 --> 01:30:34,530
you've got to admit you have a problem.

1716
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:38,370
And when I finally admitted I got
a problem, when I finally said it,

1717
01:30:38,371 --> 01:30:41,070
when I finally could acknowledge and look
somebody in the eye and tell him this

1718
01:30:41,071 --> 01:30:41,904
is what's going on,

1719
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:45,930
I'm finding a way to lose as opposed
to when I work harder than these guys.

1720
01:30:46,110 --> 01:30:50,400
I've been at this long drive, I'm
losing, I know how to stop submissions.

1721
01:30:50,430 --> 01:30:53,720
I'm finding my way into them. I'm finding
a way out and that's what's happening.

1722
01:30:53,730 --> 01:30:57,840
I had to acknowledge that. And
once I did it, I never lost again.

1723
01:30:57,841 --> 01:31:00,930
I lost to Paulo, which was,
you know the controversial one.

1724
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:03,330
I lost a to Anderson after dominate,
you know,

1725
01:31:03,350 --> 01:31:06,810
I've never been beat since it says I saw
this doctor. That's incredible. Now, Joe,

1726
01:31:06,811 --> 01:31:09,420
let me ask you a question. Are you ever
allowed to give a shout out on the show?

1727
01:31:09,421 --> 01:31:12,720
Like, do you ever say hi to anybody?
Like if I was to say hi Brittany,

1728
01:31:12,721 --> 01:31:16,260
because my girlfriend just
texted musicians watching
the show and I mentioned

1729
01:31:16,261 --> 01:31:19,800
the name Brittany to earn myself special
points. Is that going to take you off?

1730
01:31:19,801 --> 01:31:21,660
Cause I won't go. And then
I'm going to say, Brittany,

1731
01:31:21,661 --> 01:31:23,760
if this is going to be like a cheap
plug in, you're going to get mad.

1732
01:31:23,860 --> 01:31:27,560
I'll do it. Hello Brittany.
Thanks for tuning in. Thank
you buddy. Very nice. Yeah,

1733
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:29,140
that's a beautiful story,
man.

1734
01:31:29,141 --> 01:31:32,170
I knew there must have had to been
something on the mental side because, um,

1735
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:35,920
you know, I, I remember as you
do that the [inaudible] was a,

1736
01:31:35,921 --> 01:31:40,300
an excellent performance and uh, I'm, I
remember being really impressed with that,

1737
01:31:40,450 --> 01:31:43,690
but even more so impressed with the
Nate Marquardt fight because, you know,

1738
01:31:43,691 --> 01:31:46,660
I knew that you should was a grappler.
I wasn't surprised that you were a,

1739
01:31:46,661 --> 01:31:48,220
a stronger grasp within him,

1740
01:31:48,221 --> 01:31:52,090
but I was surprised that Nate Marquardt
just couldn't stop you from taking them

1741
01:31:52,091 --> 01:31:54,820
down. He just could not stop you
and the way you were doing it,

1742
01:31:54,821 --> 01:31:57,160
you were ragdoll on him to the
point where we're like, Jesus,

1743
01:31:57,370 --> 01:32:00,820
like this guy is a fucking nightmare for
a of dudes, man. And we started like,

1744
01:32:00,970 --> 01:32:03,640
then we started doing the matchups, you
know, you start thinking in your head,

1745
01:32:03,641 --> 01:32:07,900
what about him? But when you fought
Anderson, man, whew, that was a,

1746
01:32:07,901 --> 01:32:12,400
that was a crazy fight man.
For four minutes or for a four rounds.

1747
01:32:12,401 --> 01:32:15,580
And how many minutes into the fifth round?
Four minutes and 31 seconds.

1748
01:32:15,581 --> 01:32:19,900
But who's keeping track? Four minutes and
31 seconds. Ava have a five minute round

1749
01:32:20,630 --> 01:32:21,463
motherfucker.

1750
01:32:23,410 --> 01:32:25,360
What was that like?
What was that like when it happened?

1751
01:32:25,430 --> 01:32:27,280
It was devastating. I'll,
I'll tell you what they,

1752
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:32,240
I had no idea what was happening in that
fight. None. And when the fight was over,

1753
01:32:33,050 --> 01:32:37,460
I was devastated. And they, they, they, I
came to and I said to the ref, you know,

1754
01:32:37,461 --> 01:32:41,210
the typical thing, like a Doofus,
what happened? The referee,

1755
01:32:41,211 --> 01:32:44,060
Josh Rosenthal is a fantastic referee.
Simply says,

1756
01:32:44,180 --> 01:32:47,030
you tapped out and he
looks at me for a response.

1757
01:32:47,031 --> 01:32:50,900
Like I was going to argue and I
simply say, I believe you now.

1758
01:32:50,901 --> 01:32:54,770
I knew that because ESPN zoomed in on
that and showed it. But that's all I said.

1759
01:32:54,771 --> 01:32:56,180
I said, I believe you and I, and that was,

1760
01:32:56,530 --> 01:32:59,870
remember what happened when
you, when you were, did you, uh,

1761
01:32:59,890 --> 01:33:02,470
think of tapping and you went out?
Like what happened?

1762
01:33:02,580 --> 01:33:05,880
No, I, I remember
falling asleep. You know,

1763
01:33:05,881 --> 01:33:09,200
it's a very weird experience if you've
ever been at, and I know you practice it,

1764
01:33:09,210 --> 01:33:12,120
so you have been, but it's a
very weird experience. You know,

1765
01:33:12,121 --> 01:33:15,090
when you're actually going asleep
and you're, but you're trying to, to,

1766
01:33:15,091 --> 01:33:18,880
to stay within reality. And I remember
having a dream thinking, well, if I tap,

1767
01:33:18,881 --> 01:33:22,800
I could get out of this now let's not
tab and fight was over. And you know,

1768
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:26,460
I had already tagged that if I hit
his split and I didn't fully know what

1769
01:33:26,461 --> 01:33:27,840
happened when it was over and I came to,

1770
01:33:27,841 --> 01:33:30,750
I didn't fully know what I'm trying to
figure out what just happened. Yeah.

1771
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:33,070
Most people by the way,
who have never been choked out.

1772
01:33:33,071 --> 01:33:34,540
We'll never be able to understand that.
And they'll,

1773
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:38,380
they'll call like fake tap and this
nap. But you, unless you've done it,

1774
01:33:38,381 --> 01:33:41,480
unless you've been choked,
you really don't understand
how confusing it is. Sure.

1775
01:33:41,650 --> 01:33:44,110
There's a lot of guys who don't,
they don't know what happened. Right.

1776
01:33:44,111 --> 01:33:45,800
When they wake up.
It's a mess.

1777
01:33:45,910 --> 01:33:47,230
And I,
and I'm one of those guys,

1778
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:49,540
I was with the other people where
I would always see fighters go,

1779
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:52,480
what happened after they got knocked as
it come on, dummy. You know what happened?

1780
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:55,990
No, you don't. You're sure.
Especially from a concussion.
Yes. Especially from chaos.

1781
01:33:56,080 --> 01:34:00,190
Absolutely don't know. You know? So aside
from being choked, you know, don't forget,

1782
01:34:00,191 --> 01:34:03,730
don't forget, I've got fatigue issues.
I got blood and Vaseline in my eyes.

1783
01:34:03,731 --> 01:34:08,320
I got exhaustion, I got a anxiety. I
get it. See, I'm a normal human being.

1784
01:34:08,321 --> 01:34:11,830
I feel every emotion. So many people say
to me, Oh, you're never scared. Yeah,

1785
01:34:11,831 --> 01:34:15,350
I come on, I'm a human. It fill
it all. But uh, you know, so what?

1786
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:16,300
So I lose the fight.

1787
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:19,390
We go in the back and they bring
me the fight of the night check.

1788
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:22,150
They pay you immediately. If you get a
bonus, boom. Here, here's your check.

1789
01:34:22,151 --> 01:34:22,984
And I remember thinking,

1790
01:34:23,110 --> 01:34:27,400
you gave me that at a sympathy because
that was such a boring fight. You know,

1791
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:30,890
nothing happened. You gave me that
as simple, I'll take it. You know,

1792
01:34:30,891 --> 01:34:33,290
I'm fighting back the tears.
I'm just devastated.

1793
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,860
Absolutely devastated by this defeat.

1794
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:39,610
And later the fight gets named
not only fight of the night,

1795
01:34:39,611 --> 01:34:43,360
it was called fight of the year. We won
the award from a fighter's only magazine,

1796
01:34:43,361 --> 01:34:46,330
which puts on the award show,
uh, for fight of the year.

1797
01:34:46,331 --> 01:34:49,060
So it ended up being a really good fight.
But my point that I'm trying to get at,

1798
01:34:49,330 --> 01:34:53,830
that's how out of touch I was with what
was happening in the ring. You know,

1799
01:34:53,831 --> 01:34:57,590
at one point my cornerman told me it's
round four when it was around five or he

1800
01:34:57,591 --> 01:34:59,870
told me it was round four when it
was around, through whatever it was,

1801
01:34:59,871 --> 01:35:02,540
the corner had the
rounds off. Um, you know,

1802
01:35:02,541 --> 01:35:07,220
the instruction I was getting was a little
bit off and I just didn't fully know

1803
01:35:07,221 --> 01:35:10,730
what was going on. And in this
next fight I'd like to, you know,

1804
01:35:10,731 --> 01:35:12,560
as I visualize and plan for it,

1805
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:16,310
that's one of the things I'd like to be
a little more aware and a little more in

1806
01:35:16,311 --> 01:35:21,140
touch with what's happening. But, uh,
it's hard. It's hard in the octagon, man.

1807
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:24,230
A lot of stuff goes out the window.
You get hit, you get kicked, you get,

1808
01:35:24,740 --> 01:35:26,780
it's tough.
It's tough to stay focused.

1809
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:30,410
How tough is it to describe to someone
who's never had that experience?

1810
01:35:30,710 --> 01:35:35,280
It's almost impossible. You know, I
almost can't do it. It's like when you,

1811
01:35:35,281 --> 01:35:35,511
you know,

1812
01:35:35,511 --> 01:35:38,330
an executive director comes at you and
wants to know that we were talking about

1813
01:35:38,331 --> 01:35:41,360
earlier, hey, why did you do this?
And you're kind of going, you know,

1814
01:35:41,630 --> 01:35:43,490
I don't really know how
to put it into words.

1815
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:45,560
And I don't mean this condescendingly,

1816
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:49,760
but obviously you've never been in
that spot because it's one of those

1817
01:35:49,790 --> 01:35:53,420
indescribable feelings.
And when you have victory,

1818
01:35:53,930 --> 01:35:55,610
that's also an indescribable feeling.

1819
01:35:55,611 --> 01:35:59,800
When you make that walk in front of
17,000 people screaming, cheering, booing,

1820
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:03,710
whatever it is, that's also
an indescribable feeling. Uh,

1821
01:36:03,860 --> 01:36:08,180
so it's a very unique sport. And you know,
people will always ask me on Game Day,

1822
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:12,830
are you ready? Are you excited
and a, are you scared? You know,

1823
01:36:12,831 --> 01:36:15,170
you'll get these questions.
And the answer is no,

1824
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:17,510
but I can't tell you what I am either.

1825
01:36:17,511 --> 01:36:19,820
For all the human emotions
that have definitions,

1826
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,850
I don't know how to describe
what it's like on fight day.

1827
01:36:23,030 --> 01:36:26,930
It's a combination of many things
and if we're going to be truthful,

1828
01:36:26,931 --> 01:36:31,850
most of them are unpleasant.
It's a very stressful situation.

1829
01:36:31,851 --> 01:36:34,490
You know, you're walking into
battle, you've prepared for this,

1830
01:36:34,491 --> 01:36:37,010
and it's all on the line and it's
on the line in front of everybody.

1831
01:36:37,310 --> 01:36:41,000
And there's a great relief if you
have victory in a great despair,

1832
01:36:41,001 --> 01:36:42,770
if you have defeat.
Absolutely.

1833
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:46,310
Proportionately used a very interesting
word there that surprise me that you,

1834
01:36:46,311 --> 01:36:50,660
you, you, you said relief. You didn't
say happy. You said relief and Joe,

1835
01:36:50,661 --> 01:36:53,330
you could not be more correct.
I,

1836
01:36:53,570 --> 01:36:57,440
I had a fight with Brian Stann after I
was out for 14 months dealing after the

1837
01:36:57,441 --> 01:36:59,150
Anderson loss.
I had to deal with the commission.

1838
01:36:59,151 --> 01:37:02,090
I didn't go back and deal with these
guys. I got this suspension. I got it.

1839
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:04,160
Everything puts me off for 14 months.

1840
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:09,740
It was eight days later before I was
back to myself emotionally because all I

1841
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:13,330
was for that week plus was relieved.

1842
01:37:13,510 --> 01:37:18,280
It was the ultimate exhale of
my life. I wasn't happy. I won.

1843
01:37:18,490 --> 01:37:22,870
I wasn't excited. I was
relieved. It was over.

1844
01:37:22,930 --> 01:37:26,470
I was just relieved that I
made it through, you know,

1845
01:37:26,471 --> 01:37:28,840
from the way into the
process to the licensing.

1846
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,750
I made it through and got out of there.

1847
01:37:31,751 --> 01:37:34,180
That's very interesting that
you use that word. Well,

1848
01:37:34,181 --> 01:37:36,840
I used to experience a relief
from taekwondo tournaments,

1849
01:37:36,841 --> 01:37:41,470
which in comparison to MMA is
absolutely, it's benign. I mean,

1850
01:37:41,471 --> 01:37:41,981
it's not,

1851
01:37:41,981 --> 01:37:46,600
not even remotely as draining
as physically demanding,

1852
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:51,400
as scary. You know? All the above, but
I still would get a great relief when,

1853
01:37:51,470 --> 01:37:55,530
when I was, when I was done, you know,
I go through a tournament, it'd over,

1854
01:37:55,531 --> 01:37:56,100
I could rest

1855
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:57,420
for a couple of weeks.
It wouldn't have to thank,

1856
01:37:57,421 --> 01:37:59,400
and then when I finally
stopped competing completely,

1857
01:37:59,401 --> 01:38:00,930
it was the weirdest feeling ever.

1858
01:38:01,170 --> 01:38:04,950
This weird feeling of not worrying
about six months in the future,

1859
01:38:04,951 --> 01:38:07,200
like don't have a drink
now because if you do,

1860
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:10,110
what if you want up getting drunk and
then you can't train as well tomorrow and

1861
01:38:10,111 --> 01:38:11,700
then six weeks in the future you're,

1862
01:38:11,820 --> 01:38:15,060
you're off and you lose because
you fucked up and you slacked off.

1863
01:38:15,061 --> 01:38:18,390
There was always this
impending doom cycle, but MMA,

1864
01:38:18,391 --> 01:38:20,160
it's gotta be 100,000 times.

1865
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:23,730
That last time I tried to sneak
out of here to go to the bathroom.

1866
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:26,120
You made an announcement, chill, you're
going to urinate. Don't tell anybody.

1867
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:29,940
It embarrasses me and me just sneak out
like a little kid. So don't mention it.

1868
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,070
I won't say I'm going to run out of it,
but I don't want you to tell it.

1869
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:34,430
I won't even talk about it. Are
you going to snap it down? Joe,

1870
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:35,580
I want to tell you this though,

1871
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:38,880
when I come back cause I don't
know what our timeline is.

1872
01:38:39,710 --> 01:38:44,370
Story that I want to make sure I tell.
Do you know who DB Cooper is? Yes,

1873
01:38:44,371 --> 01:38:46,650
I do bring him up when I
come back. Okay. I will.

1874
01:38:48,740 --> 01:38:52,080
Powerful Chelsea on ladies and gentlemen.
I don't know what he's doing.

1875
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:56,110
I don't ask a man. Ask
a man what kind of, uh,

1876
01:38:56,670 --> 01:38:59,490
movements he's doing so
that, that, that note,

1877
01:38:59,491 --> 01:39:02,060
that Samsung Galaxy note or whatever.
Oh,

1878
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:05,630
we're talking about the giant cell
phones. Yeah, it's a, it's, if it has,

1879
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:10,500
no one's seen it. It's pretty much
maybe this big. It's 5.3 inch,

1880
01:39:10,501 --> 01:39:14,190
5.3 so it's like, it's, it's like
almost like a small kindle or small

1881
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:19,190
tablet and it's a phone and it slips into
your pocket and it has a crazy process

1882
01:39:19,191 --> 01:39:22,280
or really ridiculously fast.
Giant screen.

1883
01:39:22,281 --> 01:39:25,760
You can draw on pictures like socket,
I'm here with stupid.

1884
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:27,810
He could take pictures and like
you could draw on them. You,

1885
01:39:27,830 --> 01:39:30,380
when you watch a web pages on it,
it's incredible.

1886
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:33,200
It's the best cell phone
web experience ever.

1887
01:39:33,290 --> 01:39:36,800
There's been a lot of talks that the
iPads is going to have a smaller version,

1888
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:40,250
like a seven inch version of it.
Unless the phone, I don't give a fuck.

1889
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:44,810
They should make a five inch phone. Just
make it stop beds. We like big shit.

1890
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:49,880
I use my phone half the time to
look at my email half the time to,

1891
01:39:49,910 --> 01:39:50,241
you know,

1892
01:39:50,241 --> 01:39:55,241
I mean between 50 and 60% of the
time is not making phone calls.

1893
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,410
It's doing other cool shit.
Getting online,

1894
01:39:57,940 --> 01:39:59,660
got pocket things going
to be a pain in the ass.

1895
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:03,920
I bet that note is just a pain like it
having an old trio pocket or something.

1896
01:40:03,950 --> 01:40:05,150
I'm glad you asked this Brian,

1897
01:40:05,151 --> 01:40:08,870
because I have recently gone back
to the fanny pack. I got a new one.

1898
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:12,470
I ordered one from roots because Andrew
dice clay had it when we were doing the

1899
01:40:12,471 --> 01:40:15,590
podcast with him and the
other day I remember that.
Yeah, you got it. You got to,

1900
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:16,740
I got dice class.

1901
01:40:16,970 --> 01:40:21,530
I did get a little jealous
of is fantastically designed
fanny pack. I was like,

1902
01:40:21,531 --> 01:40:22,980
that's a real goddamn fanny pack.

1903
01:40:22,981 --> 01:40:27,020
So I ordered one online and two days
later I got it and I'm very happy.

1904
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:31,970
So I'd carry that note around
gladly inside my fanny pack.

1905
01:40:31,971 --> 01:40:35,630
I'm bringing back the fanny pack strong.
By the way, shout out to Chris Liebing.

1906
01:40:35,631 --> 01:40:39,350
There was photos of Chris Liebing in
Hawaii wearing a fanny pack. Way To go,

1907
01:40:39,351 --> 01:40:41,900
Chris,
keep on rocking in the free world.

1908
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:45,120
You know, you, you bring up Chris leave.
But if I can jump in here real fast,

1909
01:40:45,121 --> 01:40:49,950
I don't know if I'm
interrupting something, but
uh, uh, I threw, in any event,

1910
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:50,731
I throw an event,

1911
01:40:50,731 --> 01:40:54,370
it was like an after party with
jail and it was a colossal failure.

1912
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:57,850
Nobody shows that we've got 18 people.
We've got this whole to ourself, you know,

1913
01:40:57,851 --> 01:41:00,850
we get drinks, we've got a DJ
with, it's a massive failure.

1914
01:41:01,030 --> 01:41:04,330
So we ended up turning the radio off
and we all just end up sitting down and

1915
01:41:04,331 --> 01:41:06,460
talking. And by the end of the night,
it couldn't have gone any better.

1916
01:41:06,461 --> 01:41:09,940
I know everybody, I, okay, this guy's
on his, uh, you know his honeymoon.

1917
01:41:09,941 --> 01:41:13,410
This guy's wife bought in presence.
These, these guys, it's their anniversary.

1918
01:41:13,690 --> 01:41:16,780
I know everybody in the room. I know him
by name. I know what city they're from.

1919
01:41:16,781 --> 01:41:20,500
We spent about three hours talking
and I'm telling them stories.

1920
01:41:20,501 --> 01:41:24,950
I'm telling them stories of UFC behind
the scenes stuff, you know. Um, and I'm,

1921
01:41:24,951 --> 01:41:27,040
I'm running out of stories. They're like,
tell us another story. And I'm like,

1922
01:41:27,041 --> 01:41:29,530
you know, it was great
stories. Is Chris leaving?

1923
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:33,820
The problem is he never answers his phone.
So they're like, call Chris, you know,

1924
01:41:33,821 --> 01:41:36,610
so I'm getting peer pressure to do so
I'm calling Chris on Speaker. I call him,

1925
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:39,740
he answers his phone. I go leave
and his tail. I'm at an afterparty.

1926
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:42,520
You're on speaker. I've got about 20
people here. They can all hear you.

1927
01:41:42,980 --> 01:41:46,180
I've been telling stories and I'm out.
I need you to tell one. And he's like,

1928
01:41:46,630 --> 01:41:47,950
you want to tell him a story?

1929
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:52,000
Why don't you tell about the time that
my mom hit a deer loaded in the back of

1930
01:41:52,001 --> 01:41:56,290
her hatchback for God about it for two
weeks. Then her and my uncle come over,

1931
01:41:56,380 --> 01:42:00,400
throw it on the kitchen table, cut it
up with chainsaws. I've been in my room.

1932
01:42:00,590 --> 01:42:03,850
I'd been punished because I got sent
home from school and a detention.

1933
01:42:03,910 --> 01:42:07,360
So they make me sample the meat to make
sure it's not rancid and I end up in the

1934
01:42:07,361 --> 01:42:10,780
hospital for three weeks with the Cola.
Why don't you tell him that story?

1935
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:13,600
He doesn't miss a beat.
He just rattles this story off.

1936
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:18,340
He puts this whole Party on its head.
I mean these people, nobody left.

1937
01:42:18,430 --> 01:42:22,750
They are in shock, including me. I'm
in shot. Wait a minute. Your mother.

1938
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:26,390
I got to go, Chris. I gotta
go. Thanks. I just hang up.

1939
01:42:27,490 --> 01:42:31,690
And because he did that for me because
he told this story to this disaster party

1940
01:42:31,691 --> 01:42:35,320
that I threw. I've always been grateful
and indebted to him. Like Chris,

1941
01:42:35,321 --> 01:42:38,900
I owe you went, you know you saved me
a so there's my shout out to Chris Lee,

1942
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:41,770
but how's that for a great story?
That's a fucking great story.

1943
01:42:41,990 --> 01:42:46,450
Cause it same shit when a childhood.
Wow. Oh he can go on and on.

1944
01:42:46,451 --> 01:42:48,490
Chris and Chris has some
other great stories. You know,

1945
01:42:49,210 --> 01:42:53,860
some guys have a rough man. That's
rough. Wow, that sucks. Yeah.

1946
01:42:54,650 --> 01:42:59,500
Chris is Chris. Chris, his aunt and uncle
greatly raised him. So he goes out on,

1947
01:42:59,750 --> 01:43:02,470
uh, what do you call it?
Jet Skiing or whatever.

1948
01:43:02,471 --> 01:43:03,610
Whatever you do on the water skiing.

1949
01:43:04,030 --> 01:43:09,030
And he's out with his uncle and aunt and
his uncle is drinking and they t bone

1950
01:43:09,290 --> 01:43:13,300
above and his, his aunt, the
uncles wife is back on the shore.

1951
01:43:13,301 --> 01:43:14,820
Sunbae then she doesn't go out with them.

1952
01:43:15,070 --> 01:43:18,710
The team on a boat and they hurt
the people. So the people, the,

1953
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:22,090
the wife goes over and they're helping
the wife of the other boat is going over.

1954
01:43:22,091 --> 01:43:24,220
So they get the husband and the
wife and the boat and you know,

1955
01:43:24,221 --> 01:43:27,130
she's not that bad, but she fell over
in her boat, doesn't run anymore.

1956
01:43:27,340 --> 01:43:31,000
So the uncles tell him, listen,
listen, I've been drinking.
I don't have insurance,

1957
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:35,500
but I really will make this right with
you if you just don't call the police.

1958
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:38,830
As a matter of fact, here's
my name, here's my number.

1959
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:43,060
Please call me and let's settle this. So
yeah, anything and just get us to shore.

1960
01:43:43,061 --> 01:43:44,740
You know, I got to get the
hospital, how my leg looked at.

1961
01:43:45,130 --> 01:43:46,330
They pull up to the shore,

1962
01:43:46,870 --> 01:43:50,380
the ant stands up cause she sees
there's some woman on the boat.

1963
01:43:50,410 --> 01:43:52,100
She wants to know what Hell's going on.
So she gets

1964
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:57,100
a little bit closer and she sees this
woman is holding Chris's uncle's a piece

1965
01:43:57,111 --> 01:44:00,800
of paper with his name and number on it.
She has no idea. She's been t bunches,

1966
01:44:00,801 --> 01:44:01,221
no idea.

1967
01:44:01,221 --> 01:44:04,760
They've rescued him taking them to the
hospital and it's her husband's fault is

1968
01:44:04,761 --> 01:44:06,920
she?
She sees the number with his name on it.

1969
01:44:07,020 --> 01:44:11,430
It says that's my husband and bitch and
slaps the woman who's on her way to the

1970
01:44:11,431 --> 01:44:15,420
hospital cause she got t boned by the
uncle. So this is Chris's childhood.

1971
01:44:15,421 --> 01:44:19,770
So you like the Chris leaves or I could
go on and on and on. As a matter of fact,

1972
01:44:19,771 --> 01:44:24,020
I bought for $100 I bought a bunch of
Chris Liebing stories. But they backed by.

1973
01:44:24,110 --> 01:44:28,090
Yeah. But then he started telling people
that these were his stories. Chris,

1974
01:44:28,170 --> 01:44:32,670
that's not your story. That's my story.
That didn't happen with your uncle.

1975
01:44:32,790 --> 01:44:37,790
My uncle did and he doubled and I got
the idea from a Seinfeld where Kramer

1976
01:44:38,041 --> 01:44:41,550
bought a bunch of Peterman stories.
So I paid Chris everything.

1977
01:44:41,910 --> 01:44:45,720
He took the money and then he still was
trying to claim this stuff happen to him.

1978
01:44:45,721 --> 01:44:47,400
So I didn't really work out for me.

1979
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:51,690
How did you keep his story
straight in your head?

1980
01:44:52,050 --> 01:44:56,970
Why just do cause he's got three crazy
stories and get the store manager to buy.

1981
01:44:57,090 --> 01:45:01,050
I bought them all. I bought the whole
gamut. We went to Japan together.

1982
01:45:01,051 --> 01:45:05,180
It's a nine hour flight. And so he told
story after story. So I bought ourselves,

1983
01:45:05,210 --> 01:45:08,550
give you 100 bucks for the story.
But he didn't know how it worked.

1984
01:45:08,551 --> 01:45:11,550
He apparently thought this was some funny
deal where he takes my money and goes,

1985
01:45:11,551 --> 01:45:13,890
buys a little Saki and Sushi
for the, just say, no, no, no.

1986
01:45:14,010 --> 01:45:16,590
Those are no mice or he didn't
get the Gig. He didn't get it.

1987
01:45:16,710 --> 01:45:20,070
So he double crossed me, took the
money and he took the stories back.

1988
01:45:20,071 --> 01:45:22,680
I got nothing. I had to write my own
book. I don't remember if I own stories.

1989
01:45:22,681 --> 01:45:27,300
Chris Liebing stories would have been
better. Oh, that's fucking hilarious.

1990
01:45:27,660 --> 01:45:29,790
I've never heard of anybody
buying someone's stories.

1991
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:32,160
Paid $100 for it because
that was a lot of money.

1992
01:45:32,161 --> 01:45:35,040
But I only got $1,000
for the fight over there.

1993
01:45:35,290 --> 01:45:39,130
Holy Shit. That's funny. Oh
my God. That is ridiculous.

1994
01:45:39,370 --> 01:45:43,600
Now what the fuck was it like going to
Brazil? You went to Brazil recently,

1995
01:45:43,630 --> 01:45:44,350
you know,

1996
01:45:44,350 --> 01:45:48,030
after all this shit that you talked about
Brazil and minister to the Minotauro

1997
01:45:48,430 --> 01:45:51,640
Nogueira brothers. Okay. Nothing's
funny isn't that a bus was a horse.

1998
01:45:51,641 --> 01:45:53,890
That's funny you say that
because good for you.

1999
01:45:53,891 --> 01:45:56,680
Because sometimes when you're talking
about Nogueira people forget there's two

2000
01:45:56,830 --> 01:45:58,810
and they're our brothers. You know,
and you need to be specific, you know,

2001
01:45:58,811 --> 01:46:00,100
are you talking about the
big one or the little one?

2002
01:46:00,460 --> 01:46:03,640
Are you talking about the fat one or the
Baldwin or talking about the one that

2003
01:46:03,641 --> 01:46:05,770
used to be good or the one that never was.

2004
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:08,800
And it's important that you say that.

2005
01:46:08,801 --> 01:46:10,230
So good for you for
saying there's brothers.

2006
01:46:10,231 --> 01:46:12,490
Cause a lot of people just think
it's the same guy filling in,

2007
01:46:12,491 --> 01:46:15,190
but it's actually to, what was it
like when you went to Brazil? Awesome.

2008
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:19,690
You want to know what I had a
great time is really Brittany

2009
01:46:19,690 --> 01:46:23,080
got to go, uh, you know,
we go out with Dana. Um,

2010
01:46:23,530 --> 01:46:28,050
and we were only there for four hours
and you know, first off, Rio's beautiful.

2011
01:46:28,051 --> 01:46:30,760
And I've been to Brazil before. In fact,
I was at Abi Dhabi one that you were,

2012
01:46:30,761 --> 01:46:33,010
I don't know. I don't know if you would
have known who I was back then. But when,

2013
01:46:33,011 --> 01:46:37,390
when, uh, Eddie, uh, beat
a Heuler, what was it?

2014
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:41,920
2003 I believe in Sao Paulo. In fact, I
was there, uh, Ryan Parsons was with us.

2015
01:46:41,921 --> 01:46:44,520
At any rate, I had been to Brazil before
you do it with Matt. And I loved it.

2016
01:46:45,790 --> 01:46:50,550
I wrestled myself. I lost to a cocker
Rico, Mr Guillotine. Remember that guy?

2017
01:46:50,580 --> 01:46:53,370
I think a strong, anyhow, Luke
to leave speed up the story.

2018
01:46:53,371 --> 01:46:57,450
So we get there and we got our own
security detail and it's tight.

2019
01:46:57,480 --> 01:47:00,970
I mean these are,
these are some bad looking dudes and a,

2020
01:47:00,971 --> 01:47:03,180
I'm surrounded with tough
looking guys all the time.

2021
01:47:03,180 --> 01:47:05,910
This was a whole nother level man.
These guys got the scars,

2022
01:47:05,911 --> 01:47:08,040
these guys got the bullet holes.
These guys got the,

2023
01:47:08,340 --> 01:47:11,790
the stitching and the whole bit where
you get that. Anyway, we're with,

2024
01:47:11,791 --> 01:47:16,140
we got this bad team now. I've never been
on a helicopter, but I love carnivals,

2025
01:47:16,141 --> 01:47:18,870
I love rides.
So we go everywhere by helicopter,

2026
01:47:18,871 --> 01:47:21,270
which apparently is
extremely common in Brazil.

2027
01:47:21,271 --> 01:47:25,020
It's like the number one a
hell port country in the world.

2028
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:28,200
So these are good helicopters
with pilots are very reputable.

2029
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:31,650
And next thing I know we're up in the air.
So this is the ultimate carnival ride.

2030
01:47:31,830 --> 01:47:34,320
Now we're there on a gorgeous day in Rio,

2031
01:47:34,321 --> 01:47:37,530
which is a gorgeous city and we've
got it from a bird's eye view.

2032
01:47:37,531 --> 01:47:41,370
I mean I would take that whole
trip, all the risk, all the danger,

2033
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:45,780
everything that I had to go through
for that 15 minute helicopter ride. Um,

2034
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:47,880
I'm a Catholic.
I went over this church.

2035
01:47:47,881 --> 01:47:51,260
That's like one of the wonders of the
world. It's not, it's not quite as, uh,

2036
01:47:51,290 --> 01:47:53,670
you know, eighth wonder of
the world, like the pyramids,

2037
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:55,620
but it's close where you look at and go,

2038
01:47:55,621 --> 01:47:59,130
how in the heck did you build that
hundreds of years ago up on this cliff?

2039
01:47:59,131 --> 01:48:02,760
There's no roads up to it. You got to
walk. It's just, just incredible. Well,

2040
01:48:02,761 --> 01:48:06,450
there's a lot of speculation about the
history of Brazil. It's coming to light.

2041
01:48:06,451 --> 01:48:08,820
Recently I think there's
some Roman artifacts.

2042
01:48:08,821 --> 01:48:12,140
They found some really ancient
stuff and uh, some, uh,

2043
01:48:12,150 --> 01:48:14,210
there's some dispute about there,

2044
01:48:14,250 --> 01:48:17,100
found some offshore records or
something like that. So they, uh,

2045
01:48:17,101 --> 01:48:21,510
they're now thinking that maybe the Romans
had even a visited Brazil even before

2046
01:48:21,511 --> 01:48:23,820
the Portuguese.
Pretty a amazing country.

2047
01:48:24,090 --> 01:48:26,970
When you stop and think about the history,
the history of it. Yeah. You know,

2048
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:31,400
so I have a feeling when you asked me
what was it like how are we received?

2049
01:48:31,470 --> 01:48:34,110
Is there any threads? And, uh, you know,

2050
01:48:34,470 --> 01:48:38,850
the way I like to tell it as that it was,
it was a scene, man. It was, we were,

2051
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:43,020
we were, we were down in the trenches
over there. But you know the reality,

2052
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:47,850
I really liked it there. And
it's interesting, everybody
knows who we are there.

2053
01:48:47,851 --> 01:48:50,490
You know, if I want to be famous in
America, Joe, I got to go to a fight.

2054
01:48:50,730 --> 01:48:54,030
If I go to a fight, I'm a big deal.
If I'm not at a fight, I'm not,

2055
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:56,520
I'm just regular guy, which is
just fine. But I mean, you know,

2056
01:48:56,521 --> 01:49:01,410
sometimes people lose sight of that.
And in Brazil they all knew who we were.

2057
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:04,410
You know, they definitely knew
Dana and they all knew who I was.

2058
01:49:04,410 --> 01:49:06,900
And I mean all of them,
from the bus drivers to the people,

2059
01:49:06,901 --> 01:49:11,040
to the people working the
desk to the cops, everybody,
the people at the airports.

2060
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:13,170
And here's how Dana described it to me.
He goes to jail.

2061
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:16,920
Everybody watches a playoff game
for the NFL in America. Right?

2062
01:49:16,921 --> 01:49:19,410
Everybody watched that go. Yeah, everybody
watches it play off. He goes, okay,

2063
01:49:19,530 --> 01:49:23,220
that everybody has 15 million Americans.
He said in Brazil,

2064
01:49:23,370 --> 01:49:28,370
80 million Brazilians tuned in when
Vandelay or rather when Anderson and v Tor

2065
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:31,860
fought.
So those are the kinds of numbers.

2066
01:49:31,861 --> 01:49:36,210
That's how inundated people are with
this sport. And that's prior to us bring,

2067
01:49:36,211 --> 01:49:39,180
bringing them this new ultimate fighter
with Vandelay and [inaudible] that's

2068
01:49:39,181 --> 01:49:43,250
airing. So what I'm getting at is
this sports huge over there. And,

2069
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:48,040
and until you're there, you
don't realize it. And uh, so

2070
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:51,190
at any rate, you know, I'm getting
recognized left and right, and that's fun.

2071
01:49:51,220 --> 01:49:54,220
That's fun for my ego. I'm
having a good time. You know,

2072
01:49:54,221 --> 01:49:56,590
I'm somebody and they want to talk to me.
They want an autograph.

2073
01:49:56,980 --> 01:49:58,480
They're all very nice.
Now,

2074
01:49:58,540 --> 01:50:02,380
I didn't really have time to exhale
and enjoy this because I've got so many

2075
01:50:02,381 --> 01:50:04,530
death threats that are very legitimate.
You know,

2076
01:50:04,540 --> 01:50:05,950
guys not only telling me
they're going to kill me,

2077
01:50:05,951 --> 01:50:09,510
they're telling me how they're telling
me when they're telling me the,

2078
01:50:09,540 --> 01:50:12,370
the lake they're going to
drag my body into. You know,

2079
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:16,090
I've got this security team because
the U of C's been warned, you know,

2080
01:50:16,091 --> 01:50:20,230
so I'm on edge constantly and I see
some kid. Is that the kid? Is that the,

2081
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:23,410
is this the guy? You know, I'm constantly
looking around. I want, I'm only human.

2082
01:50:23,411 --> 01:50:28,270
This is how my mind's working. So by the
time we left, the experience was great.

2083
01:50:28,270 --> 01:50:31,630
Looking back at the time I was there,
you're on edge.

2084
01:50:31,631 --> 01:50:34,420
You know you're looking around. Who's
the God? Who's The guy? You know?

2085
01:50:34,421 --> 01:50:36,910
My Dad had a real basic rule when
you thought you were in trouble,

2086
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:40,510
don't let anybody within arm's reach.
If the guide comes with an arm's reach,

2087
01:50:40,540 --> 01:50:43,060
hit him.
Don't wait for this first punch crap.

2088
01:50:43,061 --> 01:50:45,190
If you feel you're in danger
and it gets within arm's reach,

2089
01:50:45,191 --> 01:50:48,730
you strike first and get out of there.
Everybody's on you like this.

2090
01:50:48,731 --> 01:50:49,520
So I'm baking.

2091
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:53,410
I'm going against the most basic rule
my own father taught me when I'm seven

2092
01:50:53,411 --> 01:50:56,470
years old. And that's let people
in close when you're scared.

2093
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:59,770
So I've got my back up against the wall.
You don't have fallen his second rule,

2094
01:50:59,771 --> 01:51:02,920
but the first one is completely,
completely broken. But you know,

2095
01:51:02,921 --> 01:51:04,380
we had a good time.
We were you

2096
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:08,440
like the fight was supposed to take place
for people who don't know the rematch

2097
01:51:08,441 --> 01:51:11,560
between chill and for folks
who weren't following MMA,

2098
01:51:11,590 --> 01:51:15,910
a lot of people that listen to this
podcast aren't even MMA fans. You, uh,

2099
01:51:15,970 --> 01:51:19,150
after, after the Anderson
Silva fight you, you said a,

2100
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:21,760
a bunch of crazy shit about Brazil,

2101
01:51:21,940 --> 01:51:24,610
about insulted them quite a bit.

2102
01:51:24,611 --> 01:51:29,611
And then they were going to have the
rematch and an 80,000 seat soccer arena in

2103
01:51:30,341 --> 01:51:34,210
Brazil. But unfortunately because
the UN is having a visit there, uh,

2104
01:51:34,300 --> 01:51:36,700
two days before there was no hotels,

2105
01:51:36,701 --> 01:51:39,820
there was logistically almost impossible
to bring that many people into an

2106
01:51:40,030 --> 01:51:42,490
80,000 seat arena was just,
it wasn't going to happen.

2107
01:51:42,491 --> 01:51:46,430
So it's been moved to Las
Vegas. Was that good? Was it,

2108
01:51:46,431 --> 01:51:48,550
were you happy when it was moved to Vegas?
You

2109
01:51:48,550 --> 01:51:52,040
know, if I had, if I have to answer
yes or no, the answer is yes,

2110
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:54,500
but there's also a tremendous no,

2111
01:51:54,501 --> 01:51:59,120
and the no is simply that I was going
to get a be part of history and the

2112
01:51:59,121 --> 01:52:04,121
current record is Toronto St
Pierre Versus Shields 55,000 live.

2113
01:52:06,680 --> 01:52:11,680
We were going to do 80 to
a hundred thousand live and
that would have been very

2114
01:52:11,961 --> 01:52:16,210
hard to beat. So I could have taken
that record for not only currently but,

2115
01:52:16,230 --> 01:52:20,780
but maybe into my future years and
pass that story down to generations.

2116
01:52:20,781 --> 01:52:23,240
And you know, again,
that's an ego boost and,

2117
01:52:23,241 --> 01:52:24,920
and there's something to be said for that.
If we're,

2118
01:52:24,950 --> 01:52:27,760
if we're being candid that I'd
want the other side of his, she's,

2119
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:31,490
I don't want to fly 14 hours
anywhere while I'm cutting weight.

2120
01:52:31,820 --> 01:52:35,430
Now somebody has to, Anderson
did it the last time. Uh,

2121
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:38,480
and we fought in California. So, and
fairness, I'll, I'll go out there,

2122
01:52:38,481 --> 01:52:40,640
but how much does Anderson
could, you know, I don't know.

2123
01:52:40,641 --> 01:52:43,760
He probably weighs about two 20. I've
been next to me, he looks as big as me.

2124
01:52:43,761 --> 01:52:48,170
I'm riding around two 20, a little taller,
so it's hard to judge. But uh, you know,

2125
01:52:48,171 --> 01:52:51,290
looking Anderson lives in California,
so he flies to hours to Vegas.

2126
01:52:51,291 --> 01:52:54,800
I'm an Oregon is two hours to Vegas
and we both got home field and manage.

2127
01:52:54,801 --> 01:52:57,830
What's the difference in that?
In that aspect of it?

2128
01:52:58,670 --> 01:53:02,060
Yeah. The cutting weight is a, it's a
very strange aspect of MMA isn't it?

2129
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:05,270
It's really almost like an art
and a discipline in and of itself.

2130
01:53:05,390 --> 01:53:06,330
And a battle,
you know,

2131
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:10,580
you could be a black belt in cutting
weight or you could be a white belt and a,

2132
01:53:10,581 --> 01:53:13,850
you know, to compare it to being like
martial arts. Like you said it is.

2133
01:53:13,851 --> 01:53:17,060
Some guys are skilled in it. Some guys are
experts. You get your mic, dolce chase,

2134
01:53:17,061 --> 01:53:21,140
they got more secrets than, than you
could imagine to get weight off in.

2135
01:53:21,141 --> 01:53:24,890
Other guys aren't either guys starved
because they don't know what else to do or

2136
01:53:24,891 --> 01:53:27,080
they miss wait, you know,
we see guys miss wait too.

2137
01:53:27,081 --> 01:53:30,180
And that's a big deal when you
sign a contract. That's part of it.

2138
01:53:30,181 --> 01:53:31,480
And you've got to honor that.
How,

2139
01:53:31,590 --> 01:53:36,590
how much of your thought process would
have been dedicated if there was a fight,

2140
01:53:37,230 --> 01:53:39,510
how much of it would have been
just to worried about your,

2141
01:53:39,660 --> 01:53:43,530
be worried about your safety, constantly
worried about your food being poisoned,

2142
01:53:43,531 --> 01:53:45,840
worry about someone fucking with you.
I mean,

2143
01:53:45,870 --> 01:53:49,560
what would have been like to compete
under that sort of an environment that if

2144
01:53:49,590 --> 01:53:53,610
folks who don't know, I've never seen
a crowd more nationalistic than Brazil.

2145
01:53:53,611 --> 01:53:54,740
It's amazing how patron

2146
01:53:54,970 --> 01:53:57,670
they get it, right? That's the way
you should be. They get it right.

2147
01:53:57,671 --> 01:54:00,880
You fucking get it right, your
back, your guy, they do that,

2148
01:54:01,110 --> 01:54:04,830
Lynn. But in England they also, when
when a fighter wins, the guy wins.

2149
01:54:04,831 --> 01:54:08,400
They applaud his skill. Even if a
guy beats a hometown guy, you know,

2150
01:54:08,401 --> 01:54:09,330
I've seen it in London,

2151
01:54:09,331 --> 01:54:13,350
I've seen them applaud when a fighter
beat a local English guy and they were

2152
01:54:13,620 --> 01:54:17,580
talking afterwards. But man, it doesn't
happen in Brazil. Mike Pyle one,

2153
01:54:17,581 --> 01:54:22,200
he beat Ricardo Funche and they were
all together chanting some sort of gay

2154
01:54:22,201 --> 01:54:24,780
slur, Portuguese gay slur. Yeah.

2155
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:27,770
And I was like, no, I'm aware. You know
that's unfortunate when that happens.

2156
01:54:27,771 --> 01:54:30,540
You know, you don't want to behave
like a savage or or or, or uncivilized.

2157
01:54:30,541 --> 01:54:33,050
I mean we are in a society here and
if you're a fan of you buy a ticket,

2158
01:54:33,051 --> 01:54:35,030
you can share bu whoever you want,
but that's where it ends.

2159
01:54:35,210 --> 01:54:38,820
Don't touch a guy I won't touch. I don't
like all the fans. I like most of them.

2160
01:54:38,821 --> 01:54:42,290
I don't like 'em all but I never touch
one. But the same thing goes for them.

2161
01:54:42,291 --> 01:54:42,921
If you're a fan,

2162
01:54:42,921 --> 01:54:46,280
you don't reach over that rail and slap
it a guy and throw your drink on. I mean,

2163
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:50,090
what do you think it would have been
like though if you would one in Brazil in

2164
01:54:50,091 --> 01:54:50,924
front of 80,000

2165
01:54:51,140 --> 01:54:53,690
it would have been a scene. I don't
think they could've controlled it. They,

2166
01:54:53,710 --> 01:54:56,460
they swore that they could,
they'd have presidential security there.

2167
01:54:56,461 --> 01:54:59,760
They were planning to have the president
of Brazil there so they'd have their

2168
01:54:59,761 --> 01:55:01,710
secret services. It's like,
guys, you can't do it.

2169
01:55:01,740 --> 01:55:03,120
Know there was just a soccer game.

2170
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:08,040
There was just a soccer game and 73
people were trampled to death. You know,

2171
01:55:08,041 --> 01:55:11,790
you can't control crowds when they
decide to storm. You just can't.

2172
01:55:11,791 --> 01:55:14,970
It's displaced responsibility. I'm
a sociologist, I, I've studied this.

2173
01:55:14,971 --> 01:55:19,380
I've written papers on displaced
responsibility. You can't control that.

2174
01:55:19,381 --> 01:55:21,630
Especially when I'm the main event.

2175
01:55:21,631 --> 01:55:25,470
And the relevance to that is it means
the beer started pouring five hours

2176
01:55:25,471 --> 01:55:28,290
earlier. So now you're not only
talking to insightful crowd,

2177
01:55:28,291 --> 01:55:31,170
you're talking about a drunk crowd.
And a,

2178
01:55:31,171 --> 01:55:34,170
what I'm referring to is if I beat
Anderson up, I go into Brazil,

2179
01:55:34,171 --> 01:55:38,010
I stomped their he row. Uh, and then
I'm going to do an interview with you.

2180
01:55:38,070 --> 01:55:41,100
And it's not gonna stop and I'm not
gonna apologize to any one of them.

2181
01:55:41,310 --> 01:55:45,990
So how they thought they were to control
that, I don't know. But uh, you know,

2182
01:55:45,991 --> 01:55:49,250
if the, what did you think was going
to happen? I think they would have,

2183
01:55:49,350 --> 01:55:52,540
I think it would have been bad. I think
it would have been very, very bad and I,

2184
01:55:52,541 --> 01:55:54,280
and I would not have,
have,

2185
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:58,710
have backed off one bit because
I'm not going to change, you know,

2186
01:55:58,711 --> 01:56:01,470
I'm going to dance with the one that
brought me. I'm going to be aggressive.

2187
01:56:01,471 --> 01:56:04,110
I'm going to be in your face. I'm going
to get my mind right, my approach right.

2188
01:56:04,111 --> 01:56:08,070
I'm going to do my job as soon as Bruce
buffer gets out of my way. And, uh,

2189
01:56:08,580 --> 01:56:11,280
and that's it. And I can't change,
I mean, I don't know how to change.

2190
01:56:11,281 --> 01:56:14,840
This is what I'm programmed
to do. And uh, you know,

2191
01:56:14,850 --> 01:56:19,020
I hate to talk like one of
those main x Oh, to give him
my life pub, Blah. But Joe,

2192
01:56:19,021 --> 01:56:20,440
I swear to you,
hand to God,

2193
01:56:20,441 --> 01:56:24,710
I'd given my life to win that
championship if I had to. Whoa.

2194
01:56:27,180 --> 01:56:29,850
I mean, let's not forget,
this is a tough guy talk.

2195
01:56:29,851 --> 01:56:33,570
I signed the contract to go to Brazil to
do the fight. And in my heart I thought,

2196
01:56:33,650 --> 01:56:36,420
I don't know how this is going to go.
I made my mother promise you wouldn't go.

2197
01:56:36,690 --> 01:56:38,820
You know, my mother doesn't
get it. She's an older woman.

2198
01:56:38,821 --> 01:56:41,130
She's got a ruby or a diamond
on every finger. You know,

2199
01:56:41,131 --> 01:56:43,710
you don't go into South America
like that level on a fight.

2200
01:56:44,580 --> 01:56:48,630
It was just one of those deals. But
it, look, this is what I'm going to do.

2201
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:53,130
Wow. That's a crazy stance,
man. That's a crazy mindset.

2202
01:56:53,970 --> 01:56:56,900
I agree. I don't know that I'm
proud of that. I don't, I don't,

2203
01:56:56,901 --> 01:56:58,770
I don't mean to sit here and
sound like a big tough guy.

2204
01:56:58,771 --> 01:57:00,740
That's not really what I'm doing. I'm
just trying to be candid, but you know,

2205
01:57:00,750 --> 01:57:02,580
this is what I'm going to do
at work my whole life for it.

2206
01:57:02,581 --> 01:57:05,610
And if this is how it ends is how it ends,
but I'm going to get that before I go.

2207
01:57:05,650 --> 01:57:08,080
You can't really discount the amount of,
uh,

2208
01:57:08,380 --> 01:57:13,380
a boost the hometown fighter would get
from a crowd like that or the amount of

2209
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:15,670
shock, the, uh,

2210
01:57:15,671 --> 01:57:19,630
the opponent would get from 80,000 people
bullying you and you are ready to jump

2211
01:57:19,631 --> 01:57:20,250
right into.

2212
01:57:20,250 --> 01:57:22,080
Well, that was one of my
favorite things. You know,

2213
01:57:22,081 --> 01:57:25,830
some guys beg for applause and I've seen
some fighters, it hurts their feelings.

2214
01:57:25,831 --> 01:57:28,680
You know, John John's golf,
she hates if anybody booze.

2215
01:57:29,070 --> 01:57:33,970
And I'm on the other side of that
man. I just, I like it. I like it.

2216
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,310
I love it when they cheer too.
You know,

2217
01:57:35,311 --> 01:57:38,710
I'm not the guy that feeds off negativity,
but I do feed off of it. You know,

2218
01:57:38,711 --> 01:57:39,181
if a guy,

2219
01:57:39,181 --> 01:57:43,560
I'll pay three and a half dollars for
an overpriced drink at the MGM and throw

2220
01:57:43,561 --> 01:57:48,390
it on me. That's a compliment to me.
You know, if five incited him that much,

2221
01:57:48,540 --> 01:57:52,380
he's a fan. And how often does
that happen? It's happened
a few times. You know,

2222
01:57:52,381 --> 01:57:55,350
where they've thrown something.
I've actually never had a drink.

2223
01:57:55,470 --> 01:57:58,260
I had one guy so mad he took his own
hat off his head and throw it at me.

2224
01:57:58,260 --> 01:58:00,150
He missed. But you
know, you get the point.

2225
01:58:00,151 --> 01:58:03,740
I kind of felt like I was wanting to
hand it back to them. But you know,

2226
01:58:04,640 --> 01:58:07,440
it's one of those deals, but you know,
they get so insightful. But you know,

2227
01:58:07,530 --> 01:58:10,470
don't forget the other side of that coin.
Not only are they upset with me,

2228
01:58:10,950 --> 01:58:15,030
but they're cheering. They're guy. You
know, if you want to back your guy,

2229
01:58:15,150 --> 01:58:18,960
you're a fan man. You work hard for that
money. You took the night off, you know,

2230
01:58:18,961 --> 01:58:22,230
you, you talk dad into bringing
out to the fight, be a fee.

2231
01:58:22,290 --> 01:58:26,310
Don't touch anybody but be a fan
even if that means to bu. So what,

2232
01:58:27,130 --> 01:58:29,170
that's interesting.
That's a very interesting point of view.

2233
01:58:30,130 --> 01:58:33,880
I would prefer people not boo cause it's
kind of cunty and it's disrespectful

2234
01:58:33,881 --> 01:58:38,881
for someone who is doing
what is essentially the most
difficult sport known to

2235
01:58:38,891 --> 01:58:41,020
man and doing it for your

2236
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:44,980
and just because it doesn't go the
way of the fight or that you like,

2237
01:58:44,981 --> 01:58:47,200
you're going to boo and
hiss and say stupid shit.

2238
01:58:47,201 --> 01:58:51,460
That shows a massive level of immaturity
that I don't necessarily think we need

2239
01:58:51,461 --> 01:58:55,990
in this world. I think it's, it's 2012
and you stupid asses need to catch up.

2240
01:58:56,020 --> 01:58:58,270
That's what I'd think. Sure.
I know. So fair opinion.

2241
01:58:58,300 --> 01:59:01,030
When I hear people blew at a good fight,
I'm like,

2242
01:59:01,150 --> 01:59:05,280
that can't be anybody other than a fucking
moron. Right. You know, and I hear that.

2243
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:08,350
I'll hear that, but he doesn't. Sometimes
I bite my tongue and sometimes I don't.

2244
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:10,900
But when sometimes people
are booing a good fight,

2245
01:59:11,370 --> 01:59:14,800
a good positional battle or you know,
a good, they don't understand it,

2246
01:59:14,801 --> 01:59:18,400
so they're booing or it goes
to the ground, so they're
born. It's just a, it's so,

2247
01:59:18,401 --> 01:59:20,530
it's so stupid and disrespectful.
Meanwhile,

2248
01:59:20,531 --> 01:59:23,890
these same dump Fox will sit
there and watch baseball.

2249
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:28,480
They'll watch a live baseball game. One
of the most boring events known to man.

2250
01:59:28,690 --> 01:59:33,040
Something that you could never introduce
to another country in 2012 you could

2251
01:59:33,041 --> 01:59:36,500
never bring baseball today.
They'd be like boring as fuck.

2252
01:59:36,850 --> 01:59:39,480
Silly all with the stick game.

2253
01:59:39,510 --> 01:59:43,180
You look at football and people just
adored in this country. And again,

2254
01:59:43,181 --> 01:59:46,450
good for them. But you know, in
a four and a half hour NFL game,

2255
01:59:46,550 --> 01:59:48,790
there are seven and a
half minutes of action.

2256
01:59:48,791 --> 01:59:51,460
If you start the timer and you turn it
on, I'm going, you know, I, I can't,

2257
01:59:51,461 --> 01:59:54,610
I can't play along that. That's
exciting. You know, I don't know.

2258
01:59:54,660 --> 01:59:57,370
I don't know that I have add,
but I do for that.

2259
01:59:57,371 --> 02:00:00,210
You're going to do it and
then you're going to take a
break. And then these, the,

2260
02:00:00,220 --> 02:00:02,650
these big, large, but they're
all muscled up and they see,

2261
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:03,940
they run to their mailbox.

2262
02:00:03,940 --> 02:00:07,210
They got to stop at the neighbor's kid's
lemonade stand there. So out of shape.

2263
02:00:07,211 --> 02:00:09,430
You know, these guys, they played
for seven and half minutes.

2264
02:00:09,431 --> 02:00:12,730
You know how many times they're good with
the water bucket? What are you doing?

2265
02:00:12,731 --> 02:00:15,350
Good. How are you possibly tired? I miss,

2266
02:00:15,351 --> 02:00:17,620
and you're doing your show for
several hours. I don't know.

2267
02:00:17,710 --> 02:00:19,240
I don't have anything to
drink. You know, what are they?

2268
02:00:19,241 --> 02:00:22,210
They're dragging down the Gatorade.
It's, hey, I don't get it. You know,

2269
02:00:22,211 --> 02:00:25,270
and some people cheer these
guys. It's like, you know,
good for you. I know. I'm the,

2270
02:00:25,420 --> 02:00:27,000
I'm the minority.
I'm the one missing out.

2271
02:00:27,020 --> 02:00:30,520
My life would be better if I can really
get into sports and have something to do

2272
02:00:30,810 --> 02:00:34,000
that because I'd have something
to do. You know, I used to,

2273
02:00:34,390 --> 02:00:38,770
I used to have to count down
you fcs, which were five a
year, you know, six a year.

2274
02:00:38,770 --> 02:00:40,380
And then pride would do four or five.
You know what?

2275
02:00:40,390 --> 02:00:42,030
I would count those days down,

2276
02:00:42,070 --> 02:00:44,570
literally count on dummy
and my dad would be titanic.

2277
02:00:44,650 --> 02:00:46,760
Abbott's going to fight this
guy. We yell, it's not missing.

2278
02:00:46,780 --> 02:00:50,190
We're going to have a party. And, uh,
you know, so what I'm saying is if I,

2279
02:00:50,230 --> 02:00:53,500
if I could get in that same passion for
other sports, I'd have a better life.

2280
02:00:53,501 --> 02:00:54,111
I'd have hobbies.

2281
02:00:54,111 --> 02:00:56,910
I have something to do like my friends
and sit up and they watch sports center

2282
02:00:56,911 --> 02:01:00,100
and somehow they're entertained by that.
I don't get as good.

2283
02:01:00,970 --> 02:01:02,460
I think you're better off without it.
And I don't,

2284
02:01:02,461 --> 02:01:04,960
I don't think it's bad to have one
or two sports that you're into.

2285
02:01:04,961 --> 02:01:06,160
There's nothing wrong with that.

2286
02:01:06,161 --> 02:01:09,820
But I know guys who their whole life was
just following other people doing shit.

2287
02:01:10,510 --> 02:01:14,230
And I hear you. I hear you. That happens
a lot. I can't get behind football.

2288
02:01:14,260 --> 02:01:16,210
I appreciate it.
I respect them as athletes,

2289
02:01:16,270 --> 02:01:18,970
some incredible athletes and
football. But it, to me, it's just,

2290
02:01:19,180 --> 02:01:22,900
I don't care what you do with that ball.
It doesn't mean anything to me. Yeah, no,

2291
02:01:22,901 --> 02:01:26,020
I understand. You know, I mean, I was
on Jim Rome earlier today and it's like,

2292
02:01:26,021 --> 02:01:27,910
you know,
Jim,

2293
02:01:27,911 --> 02:01:31,660
how many times have you had to sit
here and interview a golfer or a tennis

2294
02:01:31,661 --> 02:01:35,110
player or a Nascar guy?
Could you imagine being a NASCAR,

2295
02:01:35,260 --> 02:01:39,560
you push your foot down and you make
left turns all afternoon long and somehow

2296
02:01:39,561 --> 02:01:40,160
that's a,

2297
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:43,760
that's a meaningful event to society. And
I'm scratching my head going, you know,

2298
02:01:44,210 --> 02:01:48,040
I wish that I was one of those
guys that enjoy this, but I just,

2299
02:01:48,041 --> 02:01:52,730
I don't get you're making left
turns all Sunday afternoons. What?

2300
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:56,230
Damning appraisals of America. Yeah. And
I just, I don't understand it. You know,

2301
02:01:56,250 --> 02:01:58,640
I'm talking to Jim Rome and it's
like, you know, Jim, good for you.

2302
02:01:58,641 --> 02:02:01,410
You finally got that he's
somebody and you know, you're,

2303
02:02:01,411 --> 02:02:05,690
you're welcoming and he is very welcome.
He's an absolute ally to the UFC.

2304
02:02:05,691 --> 02:02:09,200
You know, Dana White went on a rant one
time. It was great against ESPN where he,

2305
02:02:09,201 --> 02:02:09,441
you know,

2306
02:02:09,441 --> 02:02:14,240
Dana was mad Esbi Mri and then he finishes
by going the only thing good as Jim

2307
02:02:14,240 --> 02:02:15,001
Rome, you know, he didn't, he,

2308
02:02:15,001 --> 02:02:18,140
he made sure to give Jim that property
cause Jim deserves it. He's one of the,

2309
02:02:18,141 --> 02:02:20,610
those leaders that came
out and he embraced, uh,

2310
02:02:20,750 --> 02:02:25,640
martial arts and the UFC to be specific.
Yeah. Good for him. I'm glad he did that.

2311
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:29,830
Now I want to tell you this story.
Can I? Okay. So I wrote this book, uh,

2312
02:02:29,900 --> 02:02:31,580
the voice of reason
which comes out tomorrow.

2313
02:02:31,581 --> 02:02:34,520
Let me give myself a chip pass to
enlightened. Thank you very much.

2314
02:02:34,521 --> 02:02:36,220
Vip Pass the layman, the
hips, the bookshelves.

2315
02:02:36,230 --> 02:02:39,500
Tomorrow is available
right now@amazon.com. This
isn't a plug for the book.

2316
02:02:39,501 --> 02:02:43,560
That was a plug. I'm done. Okay.
I want to tell you a story.

2317
02:02:43,590 --> 02:02:45,470
I've only told the story twice in my life,

2318
02:02:45,471 --> 02:02:47,120
so I don't know if I'm good at telling it.

2319
02:02:47,270 --> 02:02:50,510
I told this e w when you
write a book these days,

2320
02:02:50,540 --> 02:02:53,330
you don't actually have to write anything.
You talk it all out.

2321
02:02:53,331 --> 02:02:56,970
It all goes into the stance of
whatever they call it. And then they,

2322
02:02:57,170 --> 02:02:59,060
they go back and they type it out for you.

2323
02:02:59,810 --> 02:03:04,610
So I tell this story and
I know who DB Cooper is.

2324
02:03:05,030 --> 02:03:08,750
Okay. I know who DB Cooper is.
My whole family knows and it's,

2325
02:03:08,820 --> 02:03:12,500
it's been like a family secret or,
or however for a number of years.

2326
02:03:12,501 --> 02:03:14,420
So you know who the guy is.
I know who he is.

2327
02:03:14,421 --> 02:03:17,960
He's alive and well and a lot of
times over the past few years,

2328
02:03:18,050 --> 02:03:19,940
somebody will be on their deathbed.
You know,

2329
02:03:19,941 --> 02:03:21,590
this just happened about four years ago.

2330
02:03:21,591 --> 02:03:23,960
The guys on his deathbed and he
comes out and says, I'm DB Cooper.

2331
02:03:23,961 --> 02:03:26,750
And he tells his whole family and they
go to the media and the media jumps

2332
02:03:26,751 --> 02:03:27,560
mining and says,
well,

2333
02:03:27,560 --> 02:03:31,520
it must be true because why else would
you want to go down as a criminal on your

2334
02:03:31,580 --> 02:03:32,413
deathbed?

2335
02:03:32,630 --> 02:03:35,810
And I'm sitting there and I told everybody
that would listen when they look into

2336
02:03:35,811 --> 02:03:39,890
these facts of this guy's putting
out, I assure you, that won't be DB.

2337
02:03:39,950 --> 02:03:41,650
I told everybody,
but I never told them why.

2338
02:03:41,650 --> 02:03:44,810
I never told him how I was so confident.
It's my big, big worldwide news.

2339
02:03:44,811 --> 02:03:48,290
DB Cooper case finally saw and then they
unraveled it. And sure enough it was,

2340
02:03:48,291 --> 02:03:49,580
if I told everybody that wasn't him.

2341
02:03:49,910 --> 02:03:51,980
Well the reason I knew it wasn't
him was I know who db Cooper is.

2342
02:03:51,981 --> 02:03:55,400
My whole family knew and it was a
secret and my father passed away.

2343
02:03:55,580 --> 02:03:56,690
So now the seat now,

2344
02:03:56,810 --> 02:04:00,920
now my oath to keep it a
secret has also passed away.

2345
02:04:00,921 --> 02:04:04,970
I don't feel that I, I can't reveal
the story. He's alive and well.

2346
02:04:04,971 --> 02:04:08,000
I know exactly who he is. So I tell
the story in my book and you know,

2347
02:04:08,001 --> 02:04:11,120
there's a lot of things that happened
in the DB Cooper case and so I need to

2348
02:04:11,121 --> 02:04:14,630
really make this shorter. I could take
up your whole a whole show with this,

2349
02:04:14,631 --> 02:04:18,140
but once folks who don't
know who db Cooper is, once
we explain that very famous,

2350
02:04:18,350 --> 02:04:22,850
he's the world's most famous hijacker
and I believe he's the most famous one

2351
02:04:22,851 --> 02:04:24,530
because he was never caught but two,

2352
02:04:24,531 --> 02:04:29,330
he may have been the first hijacker and
I want to say this happened like in the

2353
02:04:29,330 --> 02:04:32,740
70s and db Cooper hijacks a plane, he
makes it through security or securities,

2354
02:04:32,750 --> 02:04:36,920
totally different back then, gets on
board. He's in a cheap disguise. Uh,

2355
02:04:36,980 --> 02:04:40,890
he orders the plane, be touched down,
says he's got a device in a bomb,

2356
02:04:41,010 --> 02:04:43,950
a bomb in his, in his, in his bag,
shows it to a flight attendant.

2357
02:04:43,951 --> 02:04:48,320
They touched down. There he is, brings him
up on that. Now that's a sketch deposit.

2358
02:04:48,330 --> 02:04:50,450
Of course, nobody knows what he
actually looks like, but that,

2359
02:04:50,451 --> 02:04:54,270
that's the sketch deposit. If the
viewers can see that. So at any rate,

2360
02:04:54,271 --> 02:04:54,990
they touched the plane down,

2361
02:04:54,990 --> 02:04:58,470
they bring him as 200,000 in cash and
unmarked bills and they go back up. Well,

2362
02:04:58,471 --> 02:05:00,910
while the Rup he parachutes,
they don't know he's got a parachute.

2363
02:05:01,530 --> 02:05:04,950
Now where the story gets
interesting is he was never found,

2364
02:05:05,010 --> 02:05:09,960
but the money wasn't either. No sign of
him was found. His parachute wasn't found,

2365
02:05:09,961 --> 02:05:11,430
his body wasn't found.

2366
02:05:11,431 --> 02:05:16,431
And one of the things that was a problem
is where he jumped was a mass forest.

2367
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:18,630
I mean miles upon miles,

2368
02:05:19,380 --> 02:05:23,250
hundreds and hundreds of thousands
of square acres of nothing but four.

2369
02:05:23,251 --> 02:05:26,820
So basically what any expert would
say is, look, he didn't make it.

2370
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:30,770
If he even made the fall, he would have
been eaten by coyotes or bay there.

2371
02:05:30,780 --> 02:05:34,650
There's good reason why we never found
his body and it's not because he made it

2372
02:05:34,651 --> 02:05:38,130
out of their life. Okay, now you
need a couple of those details.

2373
02:05:38,131 --> 02:05:39,870
So how do I know him?
Well,

2374
02:05:40,520 --> 02:05:43,410
a family friend and I
put this all in the book,

2375
02:05:43,411 --> 02:05:46,710
I put all of this in the book
and the publisher didn't use it.

2376
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:50,850
And the reason he wouldn't use it is
because I won't tell the ne I tell the

2377
02:05:50,851 --> 02:05:54,000
whole story and about to do that for
you now, but I don't reveal the name.

2378
02:05:54,001 --> 02:05:57,450
He goes with with how to name, I can't
use it. I go, wait, that's ridiculous.

2379
02:05:57,450 --> 02:05:59,690
I can touch on every single
detail you're not. And I,

2380
02:05:59,700 --> 02:06:03,180
and I'm telling my poster going, hey,
I don't think you know who db coopers,

2381
02:06:03,181 --> 02:06:05,400
I think you should.
I think you should Google him.

2382
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:06,930
You know there's movies made on him.

2383
02:06:06,931 --> 02:06:11,220
Prison break just had a
character pretending to be
db Cooper folklore has been

2384
02:06:11,221 --> 02:06:15,090
made out of this guy.
Well where this guy jumped was,

2385
02:06:15,180 --> 02:06:16,440
was government land,

2386
02:06:16,590 --> 02:06:21,590
but that land backed up to Indian land
and this gentleman was part Indian and he

2387
02:06:22,021 --> 02:06:24,060
grew up in this forest.

2388
02:06:24,090 --> 02:06:27,210
This is where he spent his summers,
months after months.

2389
02:06:27,211 --> 02:06:30,600
They would go out and camp in there,
you know, in between school breaks.

2390
02:06:30,601 --> 02:06:32,730
From the time he was a
little kid all the way on,

2391
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:35,730
he knew right where he was jumping
and if anybody could have made it,

2392
02:06:35,970 --> 02:06:38,820
it was this guy.
Now my dad grew up with this guy.

2393
02:06:38,820 --> 02:06:41,670
He was a family friend
and back then parachuting,

2394
02:06:41,700 --> 02:06:44,220
well much like now is very uncommon.
If somebody does it,

2395
02:06:44,221 --> 02:06:47,280
you go tell all your friends, I found
this parachuting class I'm going to do,

2396
02:06:47,281 --> 02:06:50,460
they take pictures and they showed up.
This guy was taking parachute and lessons.

2397
02:06:50,461 --> 02:06:52,920
He didn't tell anybody.
And uh,

2398
02:06:53,030 --> 02:06:55,650
and he started taking
motorcycle classes and stuff.

2399
02:06:55,651 --> 02:06:58,080
It wasn't telling anybody he was
racing these bikes. That's one of,

2400
02:06:58,081 --> 02:07:01,110
that's what my dad personally believes
that we never got the story that he pity

2401
02:07:01,111 --> 02:07:03,180
parachuted,
had a hidden motorcycle and rolled it out.

2402
02:07:03,181 --> 02:07:06,240
That's my dad's personal
theory. So, you know,

2403
02:07:06,420 --> 02:07:11,060
all this stuff comes down
and, and many years later, uh,

2404
02:07:11,070 --> 02:07:14,580
the statute of limitations is up and all
of a sudden this guy starts collecting

2405
02:07:14,581 --> 02:07:14,711
a,

2406
02:07:14,711 --> 02:07:18,990
a pretty good assortment of toys from
shotguns to four wheelers to motor homes.

2407
02:07:19,290 --> 02:07:21,510
My Dad's known him his whole life.
He knows what the guy does for a living.

2408
02:07:21,511 --> 02:07:24,460
He knows what his wife does and he,
what the heck's going on here, you know,

2409
02:07:24,461 --> 02:07:27,360
how come, where are you getting all this
money? And the guy says, well, you know,

2410
02:07:27,361 --> 02:07:30,150
I'm an Indian. And, and uh,
when you reach a certain age,

2411
02:07:30,151 --> 02:07:32,100
you get some Indian money and
there's some truth to that.

2412
02:07:32,101 --> 02:07:35,170
There is Indian money that's
given out. Uh, if you're, uh,

2413
02:07:35,171 --> 02:07:36,640
if you're a native living in America,

2414
02:07:36,641 --> 02:07:39,820
but you're talking about like $1,800
a year and when you get older,

2415
02:07:39,821 --> 02:07:44,230
about three grand a year, this guy came
into it. Why the assortment of money?

2416
02:07:45,100 --> 02:07:47,980
Well,
the sketches came out of DB,

2417
02:07:47,981 --> 02:07:51,880
Cooper and it's a spitting image of the
guy. That picture that we looked at. Yeah.

2418
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:52,691
It's just,
wow.

2419
02:07:52,691 --> 02:07:56,050
There was different ones of him in the
disguise with the mustache and the whole

2420
02:07:56,051 --> 02:08:00,310
bit, but they're going, hey, wait a
minute. This looks just like you. So, uh,

2421
02:08:01,810 --> 02:08:04,990
you know, one night my aunt asks him,
they're there. They're at dinner,

2422
02:08:04,991 --> 02:08:07,390
they're all family friends. My parents
were there. My aunt and uncle are there.

2423
02:08:07,391 --> 02:08:08,530
This guy and his wife were there.

2424
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:11,530
My aunt looks across the table and
flat out says, are you DB Cooper?

2425
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:16,840
And he said, no, but
the way that he said no,

2426
02:08:16,841 --> 02:08:18,760
told everybody there that he was,

2427
02:08:18,761 --> 02:08:23,761
and they never brought it up again ever
now is it came out and my uncle asked

2428
02:08:24,191 --> 02:08:25,990
him a little bit in private,
Hey, well, you know,

2429
02:08:25,991 --> 02:08:30,130
that other night we were having
some Chinese food and you, well my,

2430
02:08:30,160 --> 02:08:34,060
my parents and uncles weren't the only
one that thought he was the government

2431
02:08:34,061 --> 02:08:37,900
did to. So the FBI had visited this guy
than he even moved away for a while.

2432
02:08:37,910 --> 02:08:41,920
I went to Arizona and then slowly
came back. Uh, but you know,

2433
02:08:41,921 --> 02:08:44,620
he was talked to by the FBI.
I thought he was DB Cooper as well.

2434
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:49,480
So when my dad was on his
deathbed, uh, you know, we,

2435
02:08:49,510 --> 02:08:52,660
he and I had, uh, you know,
you ask me whatever you want,

2436
02:08:52,680 --> 02:08:55,120
I'll ask you and I'll tell you how
the story really happy. You know,

2437
02:08:55,121 --> 02:08:58,150
it's a bit of a fun moment,
uh, between father and son.

2438
02:08:58,151 --> 02:08:59,260
Everybody leaves the room and say,
hey,

2439
02:08:59,261 --> 02:09:02,800
Dan were really happened that night when
you came in at 2:00 AM smelling like

2440
02:09:02,801 --> 02:09:05,200
Bourbon. You know, whatever
really happened that day.

2441
02:09:05,201 --> 02:09:07,660
The principal called and claim
that you and your friends are.

2442
02:09:07,900 --> 02:09:11,530
So we kind of go back and forth and I
asked him flat out is Blah Blah Blah db

2443
02:09:11,531 --> 02:09:13,300
Cooper.
And my dad said,

2444
02:09:13,301 --> 02:09:16,660
well all the evidence
is saying that he is,

2445
02:09:16,810 --> 02:09:19,720
your uncle believes that your aunt
believes in your mom believes it.

2446
02:09:20,170 --> 02:09:22,420
I don't think he had the courage.
I don't think he was.

2447
02:09:22,421 --> 02:09:26,830
So my dad's final ruling on his
deathbed was no, he, he said he wasn't.

2448
02:09:27,070 --> 02:09:30,040
But uh,
he's DB Cooper.

2449
02:09:30,280 --> 02:09:32,860
I know. Real input.
Absolutely. There was another,

2450
02:09:32,861 --> 02:09:36,580
a theory that DB Cooper was a serial
killer. That he was a guy who, uh,

2451
02:09:36,730 --> 02:09:40,140
had killed his family.
I believe it's even fun that,

2452
02:09:40,540 --> 02:09:43,720
what are you looking at Ted coopers
as it some checkers claiming?

2453
02:09:43,750 --> 02:09:46,120
How is he looking this up so fast?
It's like you are,

2454
02:09:46,121 --> 02:09:50,440
I have the thought and he's got it
on the screen and nimble fingers.

2455
02:09:50,670 --> 02:09:53,680
That's very impressive. A few, but
I tell them to give you a massage.

2456
02:09:53,681 --> 02:09:55,750
They don't put in the book. He goes,
listen, I can't put it in a book.

2457
02:09:55,751 --> 02:09:58,650
If you want to say the guy's
name, go Mike, my father's
store. I can't, you know,

2458
02:09:58,651 --> 02:10:01,180
I can't do it. I can't do it.
It's pretty God damn good story.

2459
02:10:01,300 --> 02:10:06,300
That's one of those rare folklore type
stories and it just gets passed on and on

2460
02:10:06,611 --> 02:10:10,510
and nobody got jumped in Washington state.
You know the jump DB Cooper high end.

2461
02:10:10,511 --> 02:10:12,640
He jumped and watch the guy lived
in Oregon. That's where he went.

2462
02:10:12,641 --> 02:10:15,490
So you lived in Oregon most of your
life? Yeah, I'm still there. Big Foot.

2463
02:10:15,491 --> 02:10:19,600
Yes or no? Well, absolutely. Yes really.

2464
02:10:19,870 --> 02:10:23,440
But you know, the big foot makes it sound
like you're some conspiracy theories.

2465
02:10:23,450 --> 02:10:25,970
I believe there are Sasquatch.
Uh,

2466
02:10:26,190 --> 02:10:28,570
and I believe this because
people that I believe in trust,

2467
02:10:28,571 --> 02:10:32,640
including a doctor has said, look, I know
where they are. And it's very hard. Yeah.

2468
02:10:32,641 --> 02:10:34,770
He says it's hard to get
to and he's got this plane,

2469
02:10:34,771 --> 02:10:35,840
it's got this big grand plan.

2470
02:10:35,841 --> 02:10:39,620
He's a survivalist because this whole
plan lined up about how we can get to him

2471
02:10:39,621 --> 02:10:42,260
and his personal belief and you know,
it's just a theory,

2472
02:10:42,261 --> 02:10:44,900
but he lives in that park is big foot's
supposed to be from the northwest.

2473
02:10:45,230 --> 02:10:49,160
He lives in those hills where all these
big foot stories come from and he's like,

2474
02:10:49,161 --> 02:10:52,070
look, it's not a big foot like at
some wild monster living out there.

2475
02:10:52,310 --> 02:10:53,620
I believe there is a,

2476
02:10:53,621 --> 02:10:57,620
a pack of family of Sasquatch
there just haven't been discovered.

2477
02:10:57,621 --> 02:10:59,240
We haven't photographed
and learned about them.

2478
02:10:59,241 --> 02:11:02,720
I believe there's an entire tribe
of these big foot. Wow. Come.

2479
02:11:02,721 --> 02:11:06,860
Nobody's done nothing. No good pictures.
All the pictures are full shit.

2480
02:11:06,861 --> 02:11:10,800
All the stories have holes in them.
Oh, tremendously. Tremendously.

2481
02:11:10,810 --> 02:11:12,770
Never watched finding big
foot or anything. I do.

2482
02:11:12,980 --> 02:11:16,470
I'm embarrassed to admit to you that
that I think there is a Sasquatch.

2483
02:11:16,471 --> 02:11:18,680
Should we, you know, cause I know
the kind of people that, that, that,

2484
02:11:18,700 --> 02:11:22,330
that I'm asking because you lived up there
and that's where most of the southern

2485
02:11:22,830 --> 02:11:24,770
California when they
talk about the bodies,

2486
02:11:24,771 --> 02:11:27,570
but the truth is what bodies do you ever
find, you know, bears are out there,

2487
02:11:27,571 --> 02:11:28,311
kind of are out there.

2488
02:11:28,311 --> 02:11:31,580
Do you ever walk through the forest and
find bear carcasses? Coyote, you know,

2489
02:11:31,581 --> 02:11:35,870
you sure don't end to your point,
there's a number of hoaxes.

2490
02:11:35,870 --> 02:11:39,470
There's a number of guys dressed up in
a stupid outfit that you could buy any

2491
02:11:39,471 --> 02:11:43,100
Halloween run through. Those buddy records
it and they stick it on the Internet.

2492
02:11:43,310 --> 02:11:46,220
I get that there's hoaxes but there
is some pretty good footage. You know,

2493
02:11:46,221 --> 02:11:49,070
you said there was none. There's a
very good footage. Matter of fact,

2494
02:11:49,071 --> 02:11:52,700
I've done a lot of work in the movie
business and and, and stunts and stuff.

2495
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:57,680
And this topic comes up on Hollywood
sets and these are the best guys on earth

2496
02:11:57,950 --> 02:12:00,830
for designing things to look like humans.

2497
02:12:00,831 --> 02:12:05,090
And they've said that there is one video
where as he moves the muscles in the

2498
02:12:05,091 --> 02:12:10,091
body apartment and stunt coordinators and
makeup and costume people in Hollywood

2499
02:12:10,941 --> 02:12:15,290
say there is no costume
created to do that. Okay.

2500
02:12:15,560 --> 02:12:18,710
They don't all say that. Some of,
I would love to hear what you,

2501
02:12:18,711 --> 02:12:21,320
some of them do say that
and I think they're idiots.

2502
02:12:21,350 --> 02:12:24,240
And I think if you look at that,
that's a man and a fucking monkey suit.

2503
02:12:24,400 --> 02:12:27,310
It's not even a good monkey suit.
And the man who did it

2504
02:12:28,820 --> 02:12:33,020
look up the Patterson big foot footage.
Um, the Guy Patterson was a con artist.

2505
02:12:33,050 --> 02:12:34,160
Not only was a con artist,

2506
02:12:34,161 --> 02:12:38,960
he was arrested for writing a bad check
to buy the very camera that made that

2507
02:12:38,961 --> 02:12:41,210
video. Oh God damn. And another guy.

2508
02:12:41,211 --> 02:12:44,960
Conveniently what we're looking for
big phobia, embarrass video. If you,

2509
02:12:44,961 --> 02:12:46,270
if you break this right in front of me,

2510
02:12:46,280 --> 02:12:49,150
cause I've looked into this too because
I live in that area, I believe in, right.

2511
02:12:49,160 --> 02:12:51,320
It fascinating. I believe
it's very possible. You know,

2512
02:12:51,321 --> 02:12:54,110
one of the reasons why I believe it's
possible because Jane Goodall said it's

2513
02:12:54,111 --> 02:12:57,620
positive it yes. This is exactly
kind of monkey suit, bro.

2514
02:12:57,740 --> 02:13:01,130
That doesn't even look good. It
looks stupid. Look at his big fat,

2515
02:13:01,131 --> 02:13:06,131
stupid fucking shirt as on
big hairy fucking shirt and
big stupid looking shoes.

2516
02:13:06,590 --> 02:13:10,670
That's a terrible monkey suit. And he's
just hunching over. Looks good to me, Eh.

2517
02:13:10,700 --> 02:13:14,840
Come on and looks good to me. They should
have again. There's other ones, Brian,

2518
02:13:14,841 --> 02:13:17,310
that have been a level c. That's the, um,

2519
02:13:17,690 --> 02:13:20,210
that's the footage of him falling down.

2520
02:13:20,211 --> 02:13:23,060
Some people have said to through
computers there, there you go.

2521
02:13:23,061 --> 02:13:25,890
There you see a better, it's a
better video of it. I, no, no,

2522
02:13:25,891 --> 02:13:28,880
we just saw it back then. You would
just, you just had it in the middle.

2523
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:32,100
It's a better now again,
I do want to be clear before

2524
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:34,470
I become the conspiracy theorists.
That's what it is. I'm sorry.

2525
02:13:34,471 --> 02:13:38,310
The beginning of his zoom,
zoom put, there's one monster.

2526
02:13:38,460 --> 02:13:41,610
I believe that there's a seminar and it's,
you know what?

2527
02:13:41,611 --> 02:13:43,960
I was told this by a guy that I tried.
That's how everything, they want.

2528
02:13:44,050 --> 02:13:48,120
Many ass fucking legs. I got a
ton is not, that's so stupid.

2529
02:13:48,121 --> 02:13:53,100
You're making a pretty darn good case
right now. I'm going to have to say I,

2530
02:13:53,101 --> 02:13:56,470
I'm starting to rethink that,
but this is video ours. Come on.

2531
02:13:56,490 --> 02:13:59,550
Look how dumb that looks.
It's got tits to, what's that?

2532
02:14:00,510 --> 02:14:04,440
They have double ds. Za is I what grills
have get the fuck outta here, bitch.

2533
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:06,570
That's fake.
That's fake as fuck.

2534
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:09,810
I have a good fake meter and it
just looks at that thing I look at.

2535
02:14:09,811 --> 02:14:12,780
It's big stupid looking shoes that
he's wearing. Those aren't feet.

2536
02:14:12,781 --> 02:14:16,230
Get outta here. That's a fucking monkey
suit and it's not even a good one.

2537
02:14:16,380 --> 02:14:18,000
They took a video of a guy.

2538
02:14:18,030 --> 02:14:23,030
The guy just so happened to be out
there looking for Sasquatch and Oh,

2539
02:14:23,490 --> 02:14:27,570
I fell off my horse and immediately
why I had my camera ready.

2540
02:14:27,750 --> 02:14:31,950
We saw the big foot to strolling along.
Not a care in the world.

2541
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:33,353
Ooh,

2542
02:14:33,380 --> 02:14:36,490
make sure in fairness that if
we dissect that video when we,

2543
02:14:36,500 --> 02:14:40,310
when we decided that dice that that
video is garbage. That doesn't make

2544
02:14:40,340 --> 02:14:44,100
the whole theory garb. Know people
do. I do not not believe in big foot.

2545
02:14:44,120 --> 02:14:46,280
And one of the reasons
why is because where the,

2546
02:14:46,281 --> 02:14:50,360
the area where this most Sasquatch
sightings are is right at the end of the

2547
02:14:50,361 --> 02:14:54,920
Bering strait and between Alaska and
the northern coast of the United States,

2548
02:14:54,980 --> 02:14:57,080
or the, excuse me, the Northwestern
coast of the United States,

2549
02:14:57,170 --> 02:14:59,660
that's where all of the
Sasquatch sightings,

2550
02:14:59,700 --> 02:15:02,690
the huge majority of them
were for a long time.

2551
02:15:02,691 --> 02:15:04,560
They started spreading out
all throughout the country.

2552
02:15:04,561 --> 02:15:07,670
And who knows how many of them
are bullshit. The numbers weird,

2553
02:15:07,671 --> 02:15:09,590
but the American Indian had to,

2554
02:15:09,680 --> 02:15:14,210
the American Indians had over 200
different names for Sasquatch or 20 some,

2555
02:15:14,211 --> 02:15:16,250
some of the two something
with it to a bunch of them.

2556
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:19,400
And they don't have like a lot of
mythical animals. They, this was a,

2557
02:15:19,401 --> 02:15:24,401
this was a real thing that they thought
lived amongst people and it's a real

2558
02:15:24,771 --> 02:15:28,460
animal that used to actually live.
If you follow the Bering Strait in Asia,

2559
02:15:28,461 --> 02:15:32,510
it's called gigantor. Pythagoras was an
eight foot tall, like good annunciation.

2560
02:15:32,511 --> 02:15:37,490
You're out a huge big foot. It was
essentially bigfoot is the exact animal,

2561
02:15:37,790 --> 02:15:38,430
you know.

2562
02:15:38,430 --> 02:15:41,120
Now I want to tie this school of
thought that you know, I said, yeah,

2563
02:15:41,121 --> 02:15:43,940
I think there's a Sasquatch. You said,
and then we both agreed on this video.

2564
02:15:44,060 --> 02:15:46,370
We have different opinions of the video.
However,

2565
02:15:46,820 --> 02:15:50,120
if we prove the video one way and
my favorite or yours, it doesn't,

2566
02:15:50,360 --> 02:15:55,130
it doesn't prove the answer to our,
our original thesis,

2567
02:15:55,131 --> 02:15:57,950
which is is there a big foot?
And you see this, this flaw,

2568
02:15:57,951 --> 02:16:00,470
this pitfall is we like to
call it in human thinking.

2569
02:16:00,650 --> 02:16:04,940
When it comes to alien encounter, how many
times have we seen somebody that says,

2570
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:09,260
Hey, guess what? I was abducted by aliens
and I was given a special power. In fact,

2571
02:16:09,261 --> 02:16:10,094
approve it.

2572
02:16:10,160 --> 02:16:13,790
I'm going to go ahead and make that
light turn off by sitting in my chair and

2573
02:16:13,791 --> 02:16:14,510
not touching it.

2574
02:16:14,510 --> 02:16:17,180
And that will prove to you that I was
abducted by aliens and given this power.

2575
02:16:17,180 --> 02:16:19,490
So now I sit here, I make
that light turn off. Okay,

2576
02:16:19,491 --> 02:16:21,470
I've got a power to turn that light off.

2577
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:25,910
But having that power does not prove
that I was given that power by being

2578
02:16:25,911 --> 02:16:26,810
abducted by aliens.

2579
02:16:26,811 --> 02:16:30,610
But there's a pitfall in human thinking
and oftentimes you can get people to

2580
02:16:30,611 --> 02:16:32,500
believe one thing,
one way or the other.

2581
02:16:32,620 --> 02:16:37,150
They can then connect that to a
completely isolated and separate incident,

2582
02:16:37,151 --> 02:16:38,020
which is,
which is what,

2583
02:16:38,021 --> 02:16:40,660
I don't want to happen with the video
because I'm realizing right now I'm

2584
02:16:40,661 --> 02:16:44,770
looking like a real doofus after looking
at that video, I don't need to get my,

2585
02:16:44,860 --> 02:16:46,300
my evidence together and come back.

2586
02:16:46,370 --> 02:16:49,180
Got Video was actually not
only was it proven a hoax,

2587
02:16:49,181 --> 02:16:52,990
but the guy who played big
foot wound up confessing.

2588
02:16:54,250 --> 02:16:58,160
So, uh, yeah. Or is that the
conspiracy? That could be good.

2589
02:16:58,170 --> 02:17:01,530
It could be just a guy who look, anytime
there's some sort of a serial killer,

2590
02:17:01,600 --> 02:17:04,280
people will come out of the woodwork
to clinic. Like the DB Cooper thing,

2591
02:17:04,281 --> 02:17:07,720
the same thing. People were full of
Shit. There people are crazy. Absolutely.

2592
02:17:07,750 --> 02:17:10,720
But that just stinks to me. I
look at it, it looks stupid.

2593
02:17:10,721 --> 02:17:13,570
I hear people to experts talk about, I'm
like, bitch, what are you talking about?

2594
02:17:13,571 --> 02:17:16,690
That doesn't even look remotely real.
It's just it looks dumb.

2595
02:17:16,720 --> 02:17:19,590
And the way it was created as the,

2596
02:17:19,620 --> 02:17:23,440
the just the odds of this guy finding it
and no one else has gotten a good photo

2597
02:17:23,441 --> 02:17:25,420
of it. But that doesn't
mean that it can't be real.

2598
02:17:25,420 --> 02:17:29,620
If you fly over the Pacific northwest
and you see how dense that part of the

2599
02:17:29,621 --> 02:17:32,890
world is. People, I don't think a lot
of people really truly understand the,

2600
02:17:32,891 --> 02:17:37,330
the amount of acreage of really almost
impassable rain forest to deal with.

2601
02:17:37,510 --> 02:17:38,680
And the Pacific northwest,

2602
02:17:38,920 --> 02:17:42,310
when you fly over these areas where these
people are talking about sightings and

2603
02:17:42,490 --> 02:17:46,900
they don't just have sightings, by the
way, they also have real sound effects.

2604
02:17:47,530 --> 02:17:51,970
These sounds that are at some sort of
primate that's screaming out and they've

2605
02:17:51,971 --> 02:17:56,020
sent these things to experts. You know,
people were just trying to detect hoaxes,

2606
02:17:56,260 --> 02:17:56,651
you know,

2607
02:17:56,651 --> 02:18:00,430
and these people that have been on
camping and hunting trips recorded these

2608
02:18:00,431 --> 02:18:03,670
things and these are primate noises.
They don't know what the fuck it is,

2609
02:18:03,730 --> 02:18:06,220
but it's a primate noise.
And one of the guys,

2610
02:18:06,221 --> 02:18:11,010
and I think he's a real credible
guy that has had an encounter,

2611
02:18:11,011 --> 02:18:13,570
is uh, Les Stroud. You
know the survivor man,

2612
02:18:14,290 --> 02:18:16,240
that guy was staying in Alaska.

2613
02:18:16,270 --> 02:18:20,770
He was doing one of those survivor
things in Alaska and he said that he was

2614
02:18:20,771 --> 02:18:23,710
asleep and he was a inside
is 10 or trying to sleep.

2615
02:18:23,770 --> 02:18:26,770
And in the middle of the
night he heard primate noises.

2616
02:18:26,980 --> 02:18:31,870
He heard primate noises in the woods
near him and he got out of his bed to try

2617
02:18:31,871 --> 02:18:36,190
to look and he heard just
something running and crashing
through the trees when

2618
02:18:36,191 --> 02:18:40,690
it hurt him. And to this day he has no
idea what the fuck it could be. It could.

2619
02:18:40,691 --> 02:18:42,880
He said it couldn't have been a
bear. He goes, it was very clear.

2620
02:18:42,881 --> 02:18:47,590
Primate type noise,
something along those lines.

2621
02:18:47,591 --> 02:18:50,230
Something that's just not a bear
and whatever the fuck it was.

2622
02:18:50,231 --> 02:18:54,290
He said it was enormous. It might
be possible if there's, it's,

2623
02:18:54,340 --> 02:18:58,250
there's enough dense forest that
there might be just a few animal.

2624
02:18:58,250 --> 02:19:00,520
I mean try finding a Fox.
Good luck.

2625
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:04,090
Should go try to find a Fox because I do
have a day I was driving in studio city,

2626
02:19:04,091 --> 02:19:07,230
I saw a coyote. This motherfucker
just wandering around Cutco.

2627
02:19:07,240 --> 02:19:10,390
Try find a coyote in the wild.
Could you just go, go look for one.

2628
02:19:10,510 --> 02:19:13,330
And there's millions of those cunts.
Coyotes are everywhere.

2629
02:19:13,540 --> 02:19:15,790
To live in the Pacific
northwest to be a primate,

2630
02:19:16,280 --> 02:19:20,710
it might be possible of evolution.
So you're talking about a Sasquatch.

2631
02:19:20,711 --> 02:19:22,580
You're talking about a
derivative of a human. So you're,

2632
02:19:22,581 --> 02:19:25,300
you've got to assume that there are a
little bit more intelligent than say a

2633
02:19:25,301 --> 02:19:28,340
coyote. If it's hard to find a coyote
is can be very hard to find a Sasquatch.

2634
02:19:28,490 --> 02:19:30,590
If it's true. I mean, I'm
just fueling the fire again.

2635
02:19:30,591 --> 02:19:31,550
I don't want to come up with a gun.

2636
02:19:31,790 --> 02:19:35,150
I believe it cause the guy happened to
trust just says, look, I think it's true.

2637
02:19:35,151 --> 02:19:38,090
And so I'm choosing to believe him
more than I believe the evidence.

2638
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:42,320
How many people do you know that? I've
seen one me at zero, zero. A zero.

2639
02:19:42,860 --> 02:19:45,980
Even the guy I trust has never claimed
that he's seen what he just said. Look,

2640
02:19:45,981 --> 02:19:48,310
I've looked at the MSI. Just
think they are. I think that there

2641
02:19:48,570 --> 02:19:51,010
Goodall,
she's a monkey expert.

2642
02:19:51,250 --> 02:19:54,560
She said a hundred percent
really hundred percent sun.

2643
02:19:56,030 --> 02:19:58,540
Why you shaking your head? You don't
think so? No. What do you think now?

2644
02:19:58,600 --> 02:20:00,290
What's the number?
You think the whole thing is bullshit.

2645
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:02,620
But that goes back to
the alien and counter.

2646
02:20:02,621 --> 02:20:05,620
You get people who used to work at the
Pentagon and NASA that combat and claims

2647
02:20:05,621 --> 02:20:07,980
there's aliens, you know,
Corso and, and again, it's a,

2648
02:20:07,981 --> 02:20:10,540
it's a flaw in human thinking
because the guy works at NASA.

2649
02:20:10,541 --> 02:20:12,330
What NASA has got 3,800 desk.

2650
02:20:12,340 --> 02:20:14,500
You don't think a crazy
person can get a desk there.

2651
02:20:14,501 --> 02:20:16,840
Every now and then the same
thing goes for the Pentagon.

2652
02:20:16,870 --> 02:20:19,790
I used to work at the Pentagon. The
Pentagon is never employed. A mad man.

2653
02:20:19,791 --> 02:20:24,010
Get outta here. Right? You can show me
an alien, you know, show me in it. Don't,

2654
02:20:24,011 --> 02:20:27,640
don't give me a of a pitfall in human
thing. I actually covered this in my book.

2655
02:20:27,641 --> 02:20:29,290
It's on page 92 in the voice of reason.

2656
02:20:29,291 --> 02:20:34,291
I talk about human pitfalls and it's why
we're able to believe such outlandish

2657
02:20:34,901 --> 02:20:35,591
and crazy things.

2658
02:20:35,591 --> 02:20:39,640
Do you remember a year or 2000 y two K
we all went into a panic state home with

2659
02:20:39,641 --> 02:20:43,960
water I water and canned foods. I stayed
in as well. I didn't have my supplies.

2660
02:20:43,961 --> 02:20:46,720
I should have. I was a college. I didn't
have money for what? For the water.

2661
02:20:46,721 --> 02:20:49,100
Canned foods, but yeah. You know,
we all buy into it and it's,

2662
02:20:49,101 --> 02:20:53,080
it's this hysteria with no evidence.
Real loose evidence.

2663
02:20:53,170 --> 02:20:56,920
2012 December 21st end of the Mayan
calendar. That's another one. Huh?

2664
02:20:57,820 --> 02:21:02,800
Except recently they found newer versions
of the Mayan calendar that they a had

2665
02:21:02,801 --> 02:21:07,440
never discovered before that were more
complete that go far past December 21st

2666
02:21:07,460 --> 02:21:11,600
it's 10 year, 10 more years of
moneymaking. Yeah. You know what I mean?

2667
02:21:12,220 --> 02:21:14,590
You got 10 more years of Paul and son.
How you feel about that?

2668
02:21:14,680 --> 02:21:17,640
No. Thank you for that line. You'll
finally contributed today's show.

2669
02:21:17,641 --> 02:21:20,940
Besides setting the whole thing on.
Nice to see you pipe in over there.

2670
02:21:21,180 --> 02:21:24,240
You look like an intelligent guy.
You just haven't said much to them.

2671
02:21:24,320 --> 02:21:26,330
Do you think he looks like
he's an intelligent guy? I was.

2672
02:21:26,331 --> 02:21:29,960
It was really saying chill son and he
knows how to read a map right up right up

2673
02:21:29,961 --> 02:21:30,470
until that,

2674
02:21:30,470 --> 02:21:32,270
but he got all these
wires, man. I know he's,

2675
02:21:32,271 --> 02:21:34,430
I know he's done something
today that we couldn't, it

2676
02:21:34,690 --> 02:21:39,100
got an odd form of intelligence. It's
true. What would you describe it as?

2677
02:21:39,490 --> 02:21:41,140
What?
Why do I sent meant and meant by that?

2678
02:21:41,141 --> 02:21:44,170
My encounter is that it was Tim or
years for the people that are behind the

2679
02:21:44,171 --> 02:21:46,420
whole thing to make more money to say,
oh,

2680
02:21:46,421 --> 02:21:50,680
we said 2012 we met in
2022 there's a what books?

2681
02:21:50,681 --> 02:21:53,290
There's fucking products.
Why do you remember that one?

2682
02:21:53,291 --> 02:21:56,380
When we had Pinchbeck end and he's like
convinced that something's happening.

2683
02:21:56,381 --> 02:21:59,110
It's like anytime you're convinced
of anything, I'm like, what?

2684
02:21:59,500 --> 02:22:02,890
You know it's going to go down to come me
is falling apart right before our eyes.

2685
02:22:02,940 --> 02:22:07,020
It can rebound. I said it hasn't been
around a long time. Exactly. Yeah.

2686
02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:07,930
It kind of flexible.

2687
02:22:07,931 --> 02:22:10,420
Isn't there a bunch of people like fucking
with it right now and trying to put

2688
02:22:10,421 --> 02:22:11,254
it back together again?

2689
02:22:11,470 --> 02:22:13,750
You think they're not gonna be able to
figure out why they figured it out in the

2690
02:22:13,751 --> 02:22:16,600
first place? And do you even barely
understand it? Cause I barely do.

2691
02:22:16,740 --> 02:22:19,270
Or watch the stock market
scroll across my screen.

2692
02:22:19,271 --> 02:22:21,190
It might as well be Mayan Hieroglyphs.
Right.

2693
02:22:21,310 --> 02:22:23,580
I don't know what the fuck that means.
Do you know what any of that stuff means?

2694
02:22:23,581 --> 02:22:26,160
No. Yeah, and yet the ones without us.

2695
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:30,010
Yeah. No, I, the bottom line
is relaxed. You know, it'll,
it'll, it'll work itself out.

2696
02:22:30,050 --> 02:22:32,310
Yeah, things might get tough, but how
spoiled are we anyway, you know, I,

2697
02:22:32,430 --> 02:22:35,220
I always hear these debates on
education. It's like, well look,

2698
02:22:35,221 --> 02:22:38,100
when my father went to school that wasn't
all that long. And I'm like, great grip.

2699
02:22:38,101 --> 02:22:41,340
My father, just my dad, when he
went to school and high school,

2700
02:22:41,341 --> 02:22:44,310
if you went for four years,
you graduated, that was it.

2701
02:22:44,311 --> 02:22:46,730
There were not standard setting.
You must pass this class.

2702
02:22:46,731 --> 02:22:48,690
You've got to have Algebra and you've
got to have geometry. And you got,

2703
02:22:48,900 --> 02:22:51,990
if you'll show up for four years,
you'd get a degree. And you know,

2704
02:22:51,991 --> 02:22:55,890
back in the olden day, there was no
first grade, second grade, third grade,

2705
02:22:56,100 --> 02:22:57,720
they all went to school together.

2706
02:22:57,721 --> 02:23:00,510
Everyone in the neighborhood showed up
to the same school and the teacher taught

2707
02:23:00,511 --> 02:23:01,200
them all.

2708
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:06,000
And those are the same people that have
now built our bridges and our churches

2709
02:23:06,001 --> 02:23:10,830
and brought US technology and evolved
into Steve Jobs and apple and Microsoft

2710
02:23:10,831 --> 02:23:15,370
and Bill Gates and these wonderful things.
So apparently the education system, uh,

2711
02:23:15,430 --> 02:23:18,450
it doesn't necessarily need
this great revamping. I mean,

2712
02:23:18,480 --> 02:23:20,400
before we even had
textbooks and computers,

2713
02:23:20,401 --> 02:23:24,150
people were learning and people were
doing great things in this country. So,

2714
02:23:24,330 --> 02:23:28,670
you know, we, we've gotten so spoiled and
we've turned week, you know, we've, we,

2715
02:23:28,680 --> 02:23:33,180
we become feminized and our masculinity
is gone and a lot of things such as

2716
02:23:33,181 --> 02:23:34,500
having gritten digging deep,

2717
02:23:34,501 --> 02:23:37,470
and if the economy sucks and you got to
find a better way and you've got to cut

2718
02:23:37,471 --> 02:23:40,740
back, then that's what you gotta
do. But Grin and bear it. You don't,

2719
02:23:40,790 --> 02:23:42,310
you don't go build a,
a,

2720
02:23:42,311 --> 02:23:45,390
a hole in a cave somewhere and wait
for the end of the world man up.

2721
02:23:45,570 --> 02:23:48,630
Well, one of the issues with, you know,

2722
02:23:48,750 --> 02:23:53,750
trying to get by in today's society and
bringing your kids into schools is that

2723
02:23:54,241 --> 02:23:58,380
there's a lot of fucking people out
there that have done a real shitty job of

2724
02:23:58,381 --> 02:24:01,110
raising kids are real shitty job.

2725
02:24:01,350 --> 02:24:03,720
And when you put your kids around them,

2726
02:24:03,721 --> 02:24:08,070
your kids are in danger and there's
liabilities and there's all kinds of

2727
02:24:08,071 --> 02:24:11,460
bullying and stupid shit
that goes on and crime.

2728
02:24:11,670 --> 02:24:16,670
And if you can't figure out a way to
get your kids out of those situations,

2729
02:24:16,771 --> 02:24:19,380
they never even have a chance
to let the system work on them.

2730
02:24:19,710 --> 02:24:21,540
A big part of what school is,

2731
02:24:21,541 --> 02:24:25,380
is sending your kid to some sort of an
awkward fucking prison that they're stuck

2732
02:24:25,381 --> 02:24:26,730
at for many hours a day.

2733
02:24:26,731 --> 02:24:30,930
Especially if you lived in any sort
of economically compromise situation.

2734
02:24:31,140 --> 02:24:33,120
And he'd sort of place where
there's a lot of poor people,

2735
02:24:33,121 --> 02:24:36,540
any place where there's a lot of people
that are down and out and there's a lot

2736
02:24:36,541 --> 02:24:40,230
of fucking shitty parents and you've
got to go to school and deal with gang

2737
02:24:40,231 --> 02:24:43,890
bangers and all kinds of other craziness
while just trying to stay alive,

2738
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:48,030
trying to stay healthy. Fuck learning.
Good luck. Half this country.

2739
02:24:48,031 --> 02:24:49,080
Good fucking luck.

2740
02:24:49,081 --> 02:24:52,570
Trying to learn something in public
school and how much energy is a,

2741
02:24:52,580 --> 02:24:55,900
our politicians putting on that.
How much has anybody changed, uh,

2742
02:24:56,070 --> 02:25:00,420
budgets where they're enhancing school
budgets and paying teachers much more

2743
02:25:00,421 --> 02:25:02,370
trying to make it commiserate
for what it's worth.

2744
02:25:02,400 --> 02:25:06,420
Make it commensurate rather for what it's
worth. Like, like, like, like a doctor.

2745
02:25:06,450 --> 02:25:10,650
Like having a, a, a good teacher is just
as important as having a good doctor.

2746
02:25:10,740 --> 02:25:13,560
You're having someone that develops
the way you fucking think about life,

2747
02:25:13,660 --> 02:25:17,490
not just shows you information that you
need to memorize for some stupid fucking

2748
02:25:17,491 --> 02:25:19,590
tests that you're not going
to absorb anything out of.

2749
02:25:19,710 --> 02:25:24,040
They show you how to think.
They show you how to live your life.

2750
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:29,100
They show you good examples of people
who have lived quality lives and they get

2751
02:25:29,291 --> 02:25:32,170
you to think and pattern your
thoughts in a certain direction.

2752
02:25:32,650 --> 02:25:34,930
And most kids aren't
even getting that today.

2753
02:25:35,080 --> 02:25:38,860
Most kids are getting a shit
fucking experience in public school.

2754
02:25:39,070 --> 02:25:41,950
That's what the problem is.
Sure. People need to man up.

2755
02:25:41,980 --> 02:25:44,350
Absolutely fucking for sure.
But that comes,

2756
02:25:44,390 --> 02:25:48,670
it also comes with having kids and raising
your fucking kids and being a man in

2757
02:25:48,671 --> 02:25:51,430
the first place, raising your
kids properly and correctly. Well,

2758
02:25:51,431 --> 02:25:54,370
how many people are doing that,
man? It's a small percentage.

2759
02:25:54,580 --> 02:25:57,040
It may be 30% let's put a number on it.

2760
02:25:57,041 --> 02:26:01,770
Let's go crazy and say it's 30% that means
you're dealing with 70% possible fuck

2761
02:26:01,771 --> 02:26:05,410
ups. And not every kid that comes from a
fucked up household becomes an asshole.

2762
02:26:05,500 --> 02:26:07,060
But God damn,
a lot of them do.

2763
02:26:07,240 --> 02:26:10,360
How many times did you have to deal with
kids in high school and in college even?

2764
02:26:10,510 --> 02:26:13,270
There were just a fucking
mess all the time.

2765
02:26:13,390 --> 02:26:15,100
And it was always because
of the way they grew up,

2766
02:26:15,310 --> 02:26:17,350
it would always cause their
brother fucked them over.

2767
02:26:17,351 --> 02:26:19,960
Their parents fucked them over,
nobody paid attention to them.

2768
02:26:20,050 --> 02:26:23,920
And that poor asshole just gets jutted
into the school system and as to fucking

2769
02:26:23,921 --> 02:26:27,310
figure out his own way to the surface
of the water. That's the problem.

2770
02:26:27,311 --> 02:26:30,430
It is partly because people are
weak and sissified in this country,

2771
02:26:30,580 --> 02:26:32,860
but it's also because the
system is run by cunts.

2772
02:26:33,090 --> 02:26:35,100
The system is run by a
bunch of greedy cons.

2773
02:26:35,130 --> 02:26:37,120
Don't pay attention to the
most important resource.

2774
02:26:37,240 --> 02:26:40,270
This country has its children
the most important research.

2775
02:26:40,271 --> 02:26:42,010
You wanna have a a great,
powerful country.

2776
02:26:42,160 --> 02:26:45,970
You've got to have a smaller percentage
of losers and how do you have a smaller,

2777
02:26:46,330 --> 02:26:47,710
smaller percentage of losers?

2778
02:26:47,830 --> 02:26:51,670
We have to go into the fucking places
where there's the most losers economically

2779
02:26:51,790 --> 02:26:55,120
and help those fucking kids.
Joe, you are on fire right now.

2780
02:26:56,010 --> 02:26:59,590
I'm a sociologist is what I got my
degree in. You aren't fire right now.

2781
02:26:59,591 --> 02:27:02,830
You're saying this in a simple manner,
but this is actually very deep. You know,

2782
02:27:03,010 --> 02:27:05,200
the first time I ever came to one
of your comedy shows, you know,

2783
02:27:05,201 --> 02:27:07,960
I went through school, I went and got
certified smart. I sit in on lectures,

2784
02:27:07,961 --> 02:27:10,420
I've written papers,
I read every book and get my hands on.

2785
02:27:10,750 --> 02:27:12,520
I left your first comedy show.

2786
02:27:12,521 --> 02:27:16,540
I've never thought more than I than
I did at your show. And I thought,

2787
02:27:16,541 --> 02:27:18,100
I can never tell him that
or he's going to grow.

2788
02:27:18,101 --> 02:27:20,410
You're listening to a high comedian that,
you know,

2789
02:27:20,560 --> 02:27:21,850
I'm going to look like a
fool if I tell him this,

2790
02:27:21,851 --> 02:27:23,890
but I couldn't disagree with you more.
But you know,

2791
02:27:23,891 --> 02:27:28,420
when you say very simple things like
marijuana has never killed anybody and 14

2792
02:27:28,421 --> 02:27:31,060
people died last year cause coconuts
fell on their head. We're not,

2793
02:27:31,390 --> 02:27:33,520
we're not making coconuts illegal.

2794
02:27:33,910 --> 02:27:38,010
I can't help but look at that and have
to think and rethink my stance. You know?

2795
02:27:38,011 --> 02:27:40,300
And I'm like, I don't, I don't want
to agree with Joe. I'm on the right.

2796
02:27:40,301 --> 02:27:43,450
He's on the left. I don't like
this. But why don't I like it?

2797
02:27:43,451 --> 02:27:45,070
Because he's making a damn good point.

2798
02:27:45,220 --> 02:27:50,220
And what you just said could be two or
three chapters in any social logical book

2799
02:27:50,321 --> 02:27:51,490
and you are right on the money.

2800
02:27:52,070 --> 02:27:54,170
Well, I mean, I'm not on
the right or the left.

2801
02:27:54,350 --> 02:27:57,320
I'm on the right about a lot of
shit among the write about guns.

2802
02:27:57,321 --> 02:28:00,230
I'm on the right about punishment.
I'm going to write about a lot of things.

2803
02:28:00,740 --> 02:28:05,330
I'm on the left when it comes to people
having fucking freedom. You know,

2804
02:28:05,331 --> 02:28:09,350
you're a libertarian. I'm much more of
a libertarian than I am a a liberal,

2805
02:28:09,620 --> 02:28:11,240
you know,
there's a lot of like social,

2806
02:28:11,241 --> 02:28:13,670
I believe in a certain amount of
social Darwinism, you know, I think,

2807
02:28:13,760 --> 02:28:16,220
but I don't think it should ever
apply to children. You know,

2808
02:28:16,221 --> 02:28:19,310
I think if you want to be a fucking loser
and you want to go out and your life

2809
02:28:19,311 --> 02:28:22,550
and, and fuck it up, that's
one thing. But think a tribe

2810
02:28:22,550 --> 02:28:26,210
protects its children, you know?
And if we are anything in America,

2811
02:28:26,211 --> 02:28:28,420
I think we are a tribe.
We are a community. We're,

2812
02:28:28,421 --> 02:28:30,710
we're one gigantic fucking tribe.

2813
02:28:30,920 --> 02:28:34,130
And if we have any kids that are out
there that aren't getting taken care of,

2814
02:28:34,250 --> 02:28:37,790
then we're failing. We're
failing. So that's our foundation.

2815
02:28:37,791 --> 02:28:40,880
So it doesn't matter what the fuck we
do at the very top of the apex with,

2816
02:28:41,010 --> 02:28:45,050
you know, traveling to the fucking moon
and working on the star wars program.

2817
02:28:45,080 --> 02:28:48,510
That doesn't matter if our
foundation is full of shit. So the,

2818
02:28:48,511 --> 02:28:51,740
the very way our society is constructed,

2819
02:28:51,950 --> 02:28:54,890
it's to let you know that the
people running it are fools.

2820
02:28:54,891 --> 02:28:56,960
It's like a roadmap to retardation.

2821
02:28:57,170 --> 02:29:00,380
You see real clearly connected dots.
Oh,

2822
02:29:00,381 --> 02:29:03,260
you're just a bunch of greedy Douche bags.
This is it.

2823
02:29:04,070 --> 02:29:06,360
Again, that's sociology.
You're not talking psychology,

2824
02:29:06,380 --> 02:29:09,290
you're talking sociology right now.
You were the, you completely with you.

2825
02:29:09,320 --> 02:29:12,080
If you were the president,
how would you fix all this Chael Sonnen?

2826
02:29:12,140 --> 02:29:13,670
How'd you fix this world?
Well,

2827
02:29:14,210 --> 02:29:17,410
that's such a deep question and I think
about that a lot. You know, I ran,

2828
02:29:17,480 --> 02:29:20,960
I ran for office and all that.
Misstates man, I, you know,

2829
02:29:21,260 --> 02:29:24,780
and you know who I want to be president
as Brian Stan and he's got the resume,

2830
02:29:24,790 --> 02:29:25,460
could fucking do it.

2831
02:29:25,460 --> 02:29:29,570
He literally could become the president
of the United States in a heartbeat.

2832
02:29:29,600 --> 02:29:33,260
Yeah, absolutely. And you know, he's got
a guy that corners and made John Bardis.

2833
02:29:33,261 --> 02:29:36,980
John Bardis helped to get newt Gingrich
elected. Uh, he's out of Georgia.

2834
02:29:36,981 --> 02:29:40,640
Brian's out of Georgia. And that isn't
to Brag on Newt Gingrich. What I'm,

2835
02:29:40,641 --> 02:29:43,850
what I'm saying is Brian has the people
around him that know how to do this.

2836
02:29:43,850 --> 02:29:46,640
I mean, this guy's an all American from
the Naval Academy. He's a war hero.

2837
02:29:46,641 --> 02:29:49,640
He's a sports hero and he's
as squeaky clean as they come,

2838
02:29:50,750 --> 02:29:53,610
but intelligent, articulate
people love him. You know?

2839
02:29:53,640 --> 02:29:55,760
And when I make that comment,
or if he could be president,

2840
02:29:55,820 --> 02:29:56,900
people don't understand. No, no, no.

2841
02:29:57,130 --> 02:30:00,350
He really could be the
president and he should run.

2842
02:30:00,351 --> 02:30:02,030
And I like to throw these plugs out there.

2843
02:30:02,031 --> 02:30:03,900
So the right amount of people pushing me.

2844
02:30:03,901 --> 02:30:06,560
And that's how we got George Washington.
It's not a job he wanted to do.

2845
02:30:06,561 --> 02:30:09,680
People came to him and he was finally
willing to do that. So anyway,

2846
02:30:09,681 --> 02:30:12,650
I have no idea what we're even, oh,
what would I do if I were the president?

2847
02:30:12,780 --> 02:30:15,340
You know Brian Stann. Yeah, yeah.

2848
02:30:15,380 --> 02:30:19,040
I would definitely bring Brian
standing cabinet role. He, you know,

2849
02:30:19,041 --> 02:30:22,640
he would be somebody that you would
listen to a true leader of men. But uh,

2850
02:30:22,730 --> 02:30:25,220
you know, look, there's so many
things that need to be done.

2851
02:30:25,221 --> 02:30:29,140
But the first thing that I, president
page as a vice president, you know what I,

2852
02:30:29,810 --> 02:30:34,810
I would quit lion and every politician
in the country from the state level to

2853
02:30:35,481 --> 02:30:39,230
the federal level have all in the
last four years, which is two cycles.

2854
02:30:39,231 --> 02:30:41,270
If you're in the house,
have all ran on the same thing,

2855
02:30:41,300 --> 02:30:45,920
every one of them unanimously
in the country, all 50
states jobs in the economy,

2856
02:30:46,370 --> 02:30:47,360
they got to quit.

2857
02:30:47,510 --> 02:30:51,740
No politician has ever created a
job ever unless it's a state job.

2858
02:30:51,741 --> 02:30:55,400
And don't bring up state jobs where
you're taken from doers and given to non

2859
02:30:55,401 --> 02:30:58,880
doers k you where you're taking tax
dollars from hard workers and giving it to

2860
02:30:58,881 --> 02:31:02,270
people that are in a state job.
And I'm not saying those aren't important,

2861
02:31:02,271 --> 02:31:05,750
but don't count that as as create a
job. Look, if you're a lawmaker Joe,

2862
02:31:06,050 --> 02:31:07,910
you can do two things and two things.

2863
02:31:07,911 --> 02:31:12,911
Only tax and regulate in neither taxation
nor regulation is good for job growth

2864
02:31:14,660 --> 02:31:16,990
and they need to come clean
and just say that. So you think

2865
02:31:17,220 --> 02:31:20,220
the jobs are bad for job growth there?
They didn't

2866
02:31:20,220 --> 02:31:23,010
come about organically. Yeah, I just
don't think you can count it. You know,

2867
02:31:23,011 --> 02:31:24,570
when you're talking about creating jobs,

2868
02:31:24,571 --> 02:31:26,820
what you've done is grow
the size of government.

2869
02:31:26,821 --> 02:31:29,460
So now we've got more big brother.
We have more regulation,

2870
02:31:29,461 --> 02:31:32,490
more people looking at an example of
like a bullshit state job that they can

2871
02:31:32,491 --> 02:31:35,400
create. I don't think, well, okay, let's
look at the Department of Education.

2872
02:31:35,401 --> 02:31:38,570
Let's look at the Department
of Health. You know, what
are these guys doing? Right?

2873
02:31:38,571 --> 02:31:43,470
You can't get to nutritionalists to agree,
you know, you can't get them to agree.

2874
02:31:43,600 --> 02:31:46,370
[inaudible] there's so much
done on nutrition, you know,

2875
02:31:46,371 --> 02:31:48,660
and there's books written on blood type.
You know,

2876
02:31:48,661 --> 02:31:51,150
some people need more saturated fats.
They love to do it.

2877
02:31:51,151 --> 02:31:54,090
This whole thing about saturated fats that
are doing it right here in California,

2878
02:31:54,091 --> 02:31:58,230
you can't give out a happy meal if it's
over 500 calories at can't include a toy.

2879
02:31:58,410 --> 02:32:01,770
They're coming down on Mcdonald's
as opposed to telling parents, hey,

2880
02:32:01,860 --> 02:32:04,980
take responsibility in regulation.
Now what if your kid's an athlete?

2881
02:32:05,130 --> 02:32:07,920
What have your kids, you know,
wrestling like I had to do as a kid,

2882
02:32:07,921 --> 02:32:11,790
I need calories and I also happened
to need fat, so don't come on.

2883
02:32:13,050 --> 02:32:14,460
I should be able to have two big MACs.

2884
02:32:14,461 --> 02:32:17,250
And if it comes with a toy and it helps
me to pull through your drive through as

2885
02:32:17,251 --> 02:32:19,440
opposed to your competitors.
That's called capitalism.

2886
02:32:19,680 --> 02:32:23,460
And for the government to get involved
as beyond inappropriate. You know,

2887
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,400
you brought up Barry bonds
earlier and Mark McGuire,

2888
02:32:26,401 --> 02:32:29,460
and I don't care what those guys did
either because I don't follow baseball,

2889
02:32:29,461 --> 02:32:32,670
but what I do care about is
that government got involved.

2890
02:32:32,671 --> 02:32:37,320
They had a congressional hearing
for Congress to get involved with.

2891
02:32:37,321 --> 02:32:42,060
Sport is beyond Riddick inappropriate.
And those guys,

2892
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:43,560
that's what they should've said.

2893
02:32:43,560 --> 02:32:46,020
And if I was a congressman up
there and my fellow congressman,

2894
02:32:46,021 --> 02:32:46,950
it's my turn to Spock,

2895
02:32:46,951 --> 02:32:50,370
I'm going to say shame on you and
shame on you to the fellow congressmen.

2896
02:32:50,610 --> 02:32:54,360
I'm going to say get out there and do
something relevant and if people want to

2897
02:32:54,361 --> 02:32:58,890
quit going to the ballgame, capitalism
will fix that sport and nothing else.

2898
02:32:58,891 --> 02:32:59,491
Exactly.

2899
02:32:59,491 --> 02:33:03,990
The market will dictate where that's
silly sport is and it's a self regulating

2900
02:33:03,991 --> 02:33:07,710
sport to, they choose to agree
on what is in the contract.

2901
02:33:07,860 --> 02:33:11,760
There's a reason why the NBA doesn't test
for marijuana because everybody would

2902
02:33:11,761 --> 02:33:15,510
be tested positive. Those dudes are
blaze to the gills. So it's not like,

2903
02:33:15,511 --> 02:33:19,680
well we're going to eliminate all illegal
aspects of any basketball game. No,

2904
02:33:19,681 --> 02:33:23,010
they have shit they agree on and shit
they don't agree on and they put things in

2905
02:33:23,011 --> 02:33:27,000
contracts just to make sure
that they can, you know, they
can, they, they, they, they,

2906
02:33:27,001 --> 02:33:30,780
each side enforces their point. But
it's, it's a lot of, it is ridiculous.

2907
02:33:30,810 --> 02:33:34,350
Completely redid in congregational here.
Congress,

2908
02:33:34,620 --> 02:33:37,650
you're going to sit down with the people
that are involved at the highest level

2909
02:33:37,651 --> 02:33:39,450
of our government and
you're going to debate the,

2910
02:33:39,451 --> 02:33:42,930
hit the ball with the stick game.
Sure. Oh the guys too good at it.

2911
02:33:43,050 --> 02:33:45,560
He's taken some extra chemicals
and it makes them really good at,

2912
02:33:45,561 --> 02:33:48,060
they hit the ball with a stick game and
those little kids that are watching at

2913
02:33:48,061 --> 02:33:50,010
home,
I'm going to be real disappointed man.

2914
02:33:50,090 --> 02:33:53,610
You have to find out that that guy took
some extra stuff that makes them better

2915
02:33:53,611 --> 02:33:58,110
at, they hit the ball to stick
game, right? The fuck man.
No, I think, I think it's,

2916
02:33:58,111 --> 02:33:59,070
I think it's shameful.

2917
02:33:59,071 --> 02:34:02,010
I think it's shameful that Congress got
involved in that and I think you know,

2918
02:34:02,190 --> 02:34:03,390
to call a congressional hearing,

2919
02:34:03,391 --> 02:34:05,430
they call it under a number
of ridiculous things.

2920
02:34:05,430 --> 02:34:08,760
They call it on the poor guy from BP
because they got an oil leak out in the

2921
02:34:08,761 --> 02:34:11,130
ocean and that's horrible and I don't
want to see the ocean and get a leak,

2922
02:34:11,131 --> 02:34:15,000
but I assure you BP who's making money
doesn't want to see a leak either.

2923
02:34:15,330 --> 02:34:17,710
They want to see that taken care of.
They want to get that cleaned up.

2924
02:34:17,711 --> 02:34:21,370
They want their shareholders happy. Well,
it actually really can. The BP case,

2925
02:34:21,371 --> 02:34:24,580
if they had actually cut corners to
save money and made a shotty product,

2926
02:34:24,610 --> 02:34:27,730
that was a real fucking disaster.
That's a different situation.

2927
02:34:27,731 --> 02:34:31,360
That's a company that was, you know,
they're, they're responsible for that.

2928
02:34:31,400 --> 02:34:33,940
We fucked up. You didn't
build the, the uh, there,

2929
02:34:33,941 --> 02:34:37,080
there's two different ways to build
that valve and they didn't build the,

2930
02:34:37,090 --> 02:34:41,280
they took a shortcut to make it to and
make it happen quicker and they didn't,

2931
02:34:41,281 --> 02:34:44,530
they'd been warned about that too.
That was a fucking tremendous disaster.

2932
02:34:44,650 --> 02:34:49,650
We had members of Congress calling to
going on on shows and telling pundits,

2933
02:34:49,841 --> 02:34:52,450
hey, listen, we need to get the
military out there. Now of course,

2934
02:34:52,451 --> 02:34:54,130
they don't say what the military
is going to do. We don't have,

2935
02:34:54,290 --> 02:34:56,830
what's the military? They're going to
shoot it. They're going to shoot it.

2936
02:34:56,831 --> 02:35:00,190
The oil and what do they possible they
were talking about dropping into congress.

2937
02:35:00,310 --> 02:35:02,720
Somebody was talking about
dropping a nuke and closing them.

2938
02:35:02,780 --> 02:35:06,340
That's how they're going to close off the
oil. Drop a nuke on it. It's ridiculous.

2939
02:35:06,670 --> 02:35:06,941
You know,

2940
02:35:06,941 --> 02:35:09,910
and then you imagine what that would
look like and the British guy and just

2941
02:35:09,911 --> 02:35:14,260
dolphins and whales flying
into the fucking sky. Right.

2942
02:35:14,261 --> 02:35:16,390
Have you ever seen the video,
the photograph of that? Uh,

2943
02:35:16,391 --> 02:35:20,230
the bomb that they blew off in the
ocean Brion pull that picture up.

2944
02:35:20,230 --> 02:35:24,790
Its nuclear tests, Ocean
Pacific, something.

2945
02:35:25,240 --> 02:35:29,950
It was incredible. I don't know what
year this was. It was a long time ago,

2946
02:35:30,070 --> 02:35:30,940
but the,
the,

2947
02:35:30,970 --> 02:35:35,470
the actual explosion from this nuclear
bomb that they dropped in the ocean, the,

2948
02:35:35,471 --> 02:35:37,690
the water was so much bigger than
they thought it was going to be.

2949
02:35:37,691 --> 02:35:39,610
The set all these battleships around it,

2950
02:35:39,730 --> 02:35:43,120
like they were going to monitor this
thing and see what the impact was.

2951
02:35:43,121 --> 02:35:46,390
The battleships just flock
to get flown sideways.

2952
02:35:46,540 --> 02:35:50,510
It's like miles high water, straight
up into the air. It's incredible.

2953
02:35:50,511 --> 02:35:52,660
Why we're waiting for the video.
I'm going to play it. Just a photo.

2954
02:35:52,680 --> 02:35:55,870
The one up game and I don't want up you,
I'm going to come in second here,

2955
02:35:55,871 --> 02:35:57,070
but I want to,
I want to relate.

2956
02:35:57,071 --> 02:36:01,570
I had a friend that had to do two years
in a military prison because when he was

2957
02:36:01,571 --> 02:36:05,830
in Iraq during the war of 92 weight,
way back, but it was in my neighborhood,

2958
02:36:06,010 --> 02:36:10,450
he shot a camera with a law
and a law is a rocket launcher.

2959
02:36:10,570 --> 02:36:11,650
So they're out in the desert.

2960
02:36:11,651 --> 02:36:13,950
They got nothing to do with camel
goes by and he shoots his thing.

2961
02:36:13,951 --> 02:36:15,110
So you're talking about
wanting to see pictures.

2962
02:36:15,160 --> 02:36:17,560
I don't like that the camel had
to give his life. And you know as,

2963
02:36:17,570 --> 02:36:20,260
as the rumor goes there, they're
quite coveted it over there. I don't,

2964
02:36:20,261 --> 02:36:23,590
I don't say this to be a
disingenuous or denigrate it,

2965
02:36:23,591 --> 02:36:25,960
but I'm told you and you can
even marry one over there.

2966
02:36:25,961 --> 02:36:29,230
Whether that's true or not, I
don't know. But it's that serious.

2967
02:36:29,380 --> 02:36:31,040
He shot him with a rocket launcher.
Oh,

2968
02:36:31,420 --> 02:36:33,220
I don't want that port
Campbell to have to die.

2969
02:36:33,280 --> 02:36:36,850
But I do want to see that if there was
a video or a footage and my buddy had to

2970
02:36:36,851 --> 02:36:39,310
do the guy, my neighborhood has to
go to military prison for two years.

2971
02:36:39,460 --> 02:36:42,910
I at least need to see what happens when
a rocket meets a camel in the desert.

2972
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:46,140
What did, why did they put them away
for so long? Two years along? Ask.

2973
02:36:46,190 --> 02:36:47,350
Extremely disrespectful.

2974
02:36:47,351 --> 02:36:50,260
I mean you're really talking about
offending people in that part of the Adobe

2975
02:36:50,310 --> 02:36:52,470
can see what you don't understand
that I don't, I don't get anything.

2976
02:36:52,490 --> 02:36:54,910
I was Campbell,
I watched one of those,

2977
02:36:54,911 --> 02:36:58,630
Anthony Bordain shows those reservation
shows where they cooked to Campbell.

2978
02:36:59,340 --> 02:37:03,340
They board the Kamma cooked it. Yeah,
they'll slow cooked it underground.

2979
02:37:03,850 --> 02:37:07,480
It's like whoa, green a camel. I
didn't even know they ain't camels.

2980
02:37:07,540 --> 02:37:10,600
I guess when you're stuck out there and
there's nothing but Campbell's you've

2981
02:37:10,601 --> 02:37:11,560
got to make do.
But he's like,

2982
02:37:11,561 --> 02:37:15,320
it was like a special dish that they would
only have like certain times I was in

2983
02:37:15,321 --> 02:37:16,010
trouble cause I

2984
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:19,250
talked about the people in the streets
of a nuisance in Brazil eating monkey.

2985
02:37:19,430 --> 02:37:20,990
Well it's true.
They do and it's like,

2986
02:37:20,991 --> 02:37:22,790
listen now before you
think I'm making funny,

2987
02:37:22,880 --> 02:37:26,510
you might want to know what we put in hot
dogs right here at Yankee Stadium here

2988
02:37:26,511 --> 02:37:28,610
in America when we,
some pretty weird stuff too,

2989
02:37:28,611 --> 02:37:31,760
but it happens to be a true story
that they do eat monkey in Brazil.

2990
02:37:31,790 --> 02:37:35,090
But the point that I'm getting at is they
eat weird stuff around the world, man.

2991
02:37:35,470 --> 02:37:39,410
And I think I personally like it when I
travel, I like to try some of that weird.

2992
02:37:39,411 --> 02:37:42,950
I don't want to eat.
I eat pig intestines and Turkey,

2993
02:37:42,951 --> 02:37:44,810
but I didn't know that's
what I was eating.

2994
02:37:44,960 --> 02:37:48,080
I think the mere word intestine as
disgusting and I was pretty upset when I

2995
02:37:48,081 --> 02:37:51,110
found out I did. You never
let snail like s card. Yeah,

2996
02:37:51,111 --> 02:37:54,620
I've have had escar go on a cruise
ship as a kid. My Dad tricked me.

2997
02:37:54,621 --> 02:37:57,080
I don't like it. I do like caviar
and now that I've gotten older,

2998
02:37:57,081 --> 02:37:58,310
I didn't like it as a kid,

2999
02:37:58,580 --> 02:38:01,560
but when the Russians come over like
four for a wrestling or dual meter,

3000
02:38:01,580 --> 02:38:05,240
even the Russian fighters, they all bring
caviar that you can trade with them.

3001
02:38:05,450 --> 02:38:09,170
Try and give me money. I give you
caviar, but is worth a lot of money.

3002
02:38:09,200 --> 02:38:12,380
Their caviar, Russian caviars,
the most famous kind of caviar.

3003
02:38:12,381 --> 02:38:15,080
It's kind of like a Cuban cigar.
If you can get ahold of Russian caviar,

3004
02:38:15,081 --> 02:38:19,460
especially back with the USSR before
the breakup of the Soviet Union,

3005
02:38:19,640 --> 02:38:22,820
it was almost impossible to get
Russian caveats, one of those.

3006
02:38:22,821 --> 02:38:26,630
So we deemed it to be a little better
than it actually is, but it is coveted.

3007
02:38:26,660 --> 02:38:29,830
If you can get it. It says Russia on
the label, you'll be the hit of your

3008
02:38:29,930 --> 02:38:33,500
neighborhood party. It's like, yeah,
like you said, like Cuban cigars.

3009
02:38:33,680 --> 02:38:36,230
I've always thought it was weird
that it's an acquired taste.

3010
02:38:36,231 --> 02:38:38,270
It's so expensive and
it's an acquired taste.

3011
02:38:38,271 --> 02:38:41,630
Like why would you want to acquire a taste
for something that's really expensive

3012
02:38:41,640 --> 02:38:43,520
that initially don't like?
Sure.

3013
02:38:43,720 --> 02:38:46,710
Take it tastes like salt. You know?
I haven't like, cause now they,

3014
02:38:46,711 --> 02:38:48,470
they've eased us into it cause they,

3015
02:38:48,510 --> 02:38:52,450
they roll all of our local Sushi
rolls in a type of caviar real cheap,

3016
02:38:52,451 --> 02:38:55,720
that yellowy stuff. But you know, I've
learned to like it as we've gotten older.

3017
02:38:56,620 --> 02:39:01,450
They go on these gentlemen, tell people
that I have American loves caviar,

3018
02:39:01,480 --> 02:39:05,080
Russian caviar and anything else
wrapped his pitch up, bring it home.

3019
02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:07,810
I mean I had a great time. I got to
tell you to find a really good time.

3020
02:39:07,811 --> 02:39:11,230
I learned some things about you today.
You're not just that pothead comedian.

3021
02:39:11,231 --> 02:39:15,610
I thought you went there.
Uh, he got second amendment
and some deep thoughts and,

3022
02:39:15,611 --> 02:39:17,830
and you know, whether you know
it or not, you're a sociologist.

3023
02:39:17,831 --> 02:39:20,470
Listen to some of your arguments today,
whether you've been certified in it,

3024
02:39:20,471 --> 02:39:23,800
like I, you know, went to school or not.
You're a sociologist and I admire that.

3025
02:39:23,840 --> 02:39:26,810
Well, I'm gonna just a stand up
comedian. I think as extent of comedian,

3026
02:39:26,811 --> 02:39:30,320
you have to understand human beings to
understand yourself in order to move

3027
02:39:30,321 --> 02:39:33,500
forward, to advance, to evolve.
You've got to understand human beings.

3028
02:39:33,501 --> 02:39:36,000
You've got to understand
yourself. You know, I just, uh,

3029
02:39:36,350 --> 02:39:40,180
my observations is just a part
of life. Cool. Just like yours.

3030
02:39:40,220 --> 02:39:44,000
Just like your book VIP pass in
alignment with the first part of it.

3031
02:39:44,030 --> 02:39:48,230
Voice of reason. The Voice of reason,
which you can get right now on Amazon.

3032
02:39:48,470 --> 02:39:51,050
You could just go if you have a candle
and get it and you should get a kindle

3033
02:39:51,080 --> 02:39:51,870
because they're fucking awesome.

3034
02:39:51,870 --> 02:39:54,960
They are great insight about my
mom's, my, my mother's Day present.

3035
02:39:54,990 --> 02:39:58,680
I just said her kindle book now. I
could just send her books now. Yeah.

3036
02:39:58,681 --> 02:40:02,870
That's cool. Yeah, that is a
great service and it's amazing.

3037
02:40:03,860 --> 02:40:07,420
Battery lasts forever. I have a kindle.
The battery lasts forever. It looks great.

3038
02:40:07,421 --> 02:40:11,200
It looks like printed word. You could even
like make the print larger or smaller.

3039
02:40:11,201 --> 02:40:13,980
Like me, I'm going blind so I
have to make the print larger, so

3040
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:16,840
it's amazing. It's an amazing product.
I have an IPAD and I'll, I'll,

3041
02:40:16,850 --> 02:40:20,580
I'll watch books on that too.
I liked the effect more the scrolling,

3042
02:40:20,700 --> 02:40:24,420
but it's better on the eyes. The kindle,
I think the kindle, so superior device,

3043
02:40:24,450 --> 02:40:28,380
it's the shape. I like audio. I love
audio books if they're red. Well,

3044
02:40:28,381 --> 02:40:29,810
but every now and then,
like I,

3045
02:40:29,811 --> 02:40:33,240
I bought a steep couple of Stephen
King books that were written or read by

3046
02:40:33,241 --> 02:40:37,180
Stephen King. Those are fucking
terrible. Roger, Roger Gilbertson.

3047
02:40:38,130 --> 02:40:42,000
He shouldn't have done
it. Roger. He's kidding.

3048
02:40:42,650 --> 02:40:45,740
That's a bad joke. The guys
got to know John. I know.

3049
02:40:47,680 --> 02:40:52,070
Don't don't do that. That's a
bad Karma. Takes you out of JFK.

3050
02:40:52,190 --> 02:40:56,910
I was at the Tom likesure. Why can
they, should they go? Yeah. How rude.

3051
02:40:57,090 --> 02:40:59,640
How rude. Anyway, that's the end
of this show. Ladies. Gentlemen,

3052
02:40:59,730 --> 02:41:04,500
if you want to follow chail on Twitter,
it's Suning c h. How did you get that one?

3053
02:41:04,530 --> 02:41:08,280
Why not just chill son and I didn't know
much about Twitter when I set it up.

3054
02:41:08,310 --> 02:41:10,830
I bet they could change it.
Yeah. And I wish, I wish it was,

3055
02:41:10,860 --> 02:41:13,590
has somebody else told me the
marketing the UFC to go up to that.

3056
02:41:13,750 --> 02:41:17,690
Now it's just somebody's got it. Unless
it's an actual Chael Sonnen, you know,

3057
02:41:17,700 --> 02:41:19,610
which I doubt how many channels
on do you ever met him?

3058
02:41:19,730 --> 02:41:22,920
I've met a few Joe Rogan's no chill
sentence. And so it's an unusual,

3059
02:41:22,921 --> 02:41:25,580
you get that shit on Twitter.
That's Sun NCH. Yeah.

3060
02:41:25,620 --> 02:41:27,980
And you say tell the UFC to go out.
What does UFC have?

3061
02:41:27,981 --> 02:41:29,970
Every department who do I could,
I called Twitter department.

3062
02:41:29,971 --> 02:41:34,860
Go after that call Donna, I'll call Donna.
Joe said go head of department. I met,

3063
02:41:35,100 --> 02:41:35,851
I met someone.

3064
02:41:35,851 --> 02:41:39,270
I bet whoever has the the chill son and
he would probably be happy to give it to

3065
02:41:39,271 --> 02:41:42,900
you. Hey, hey douche bag.
Who you squatter, stop.

3066
02:41:42,930 --> 02:41:46,200
Stop hiding and holding on to Charleston
instinct. Just give the password.

3067
02:41:46,230 --> 02:41:48,310
Well I take it from what
I could just stare at.

3068
02:41:50,360 --> 02:41:51,330
It would actually,

3069
02:41:51,331 --> 02:41:53,790
it wouldn't work that way because you
want to get all your followers and bring

3070
02:41:53,791 --> 02:41:58,410
them over there. How many followers
you got? I got 152,193 not,

3071
02:41:58,430 --> 02:42:02,130
not that I keep track or a camp.
You can't not have that. So that's,

3072
02:42:02,131 --> 02:42:04,890
you've got to have to figure out a way
to get Twitter to merge the two they did

3073
02:42:04,891 --> 02:42:06,290
with me.
I had a different nick.

3074
02:42:06,330 --> 02:42:09,520
I had a different Twitter name and they
merged it and made it Joe Rogan. Oh,

3075
02:42:09,540 --> 02:42:14,460
excellent. Yeah, I think I bought it.
I bought it. No, I bought my space.

3076
02:42:14,790 --> 02:42:15,623
I bought my mind

3077
02:42:17,010 --> 02:42:20,070
nick over at tap out his friends
with the creator of Twitter,

3078
02:42:20,071 --> 02:42:21,750
so maybe we can put him on that.
Maybe we can to him.

3079
02:42:21,751 --> 02:42:24,450
Go after it and let's make it happen.
All right,

3080
02:42:24,451 --> 02:42:28,470
so it's sun and ch for now
on Twitter. Um, and uh,
