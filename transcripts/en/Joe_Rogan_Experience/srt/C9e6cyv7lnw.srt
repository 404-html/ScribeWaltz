1
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:05,880
Eh,

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,330
we're going live folks.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,410
Dana White's not even here yet.

4
00:00:08,411 --> 00:00:09,220
We're going live anyway.

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,001
We don't give a fuck.

6
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:11,110
We're crazy work.

7
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:12,040
Gangs

8
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,650
stir.

9
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,100
We're going live.

10
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,930
I'm to tweet it even
though we're already live.

11
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:17,711
That's how crazy.

12
00:00:17,711 --> 00:00:19,540
I am damned going live.

13
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:20,320
I'm writing it,

14
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,750
but I'm actually doing
it at the same time.

15
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:23,913
Boom.

16
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,243
Sock upon it.

17
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,910
The Joe Rogan experience
podcast is brought to you by
[inaudible] dot com if you

18
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:33,840

the code name Rogan,

19
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,530

all supplements including Alpha brain,

20
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,970
my favorite shit on the planet.

21
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,590
And to take it every
morning with my Kale shake.

22
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:44,530
Now I have like a whole
system that I set up.

23
00:00:44,531 --> 00:00:45,240
Brian,

24
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,660
you've got a lot of things that I take
with my Kale shake and one of them is a

25
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:53,620
spirulina and Chlorella,

26
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,300
chlorella,

27
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,223
chlorella.

28
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,173
It's a new um,

29
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,330
cloak.

30
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,050
Cholera,

31
00:00:59,050 --> 00:00:59,883
cholera,

32
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,021
Green Shit,

33
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:02,500
son.

34
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,520
Supergreens okay,

35
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,790
let's cut to the fucking
nonsense scientific words.

36
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,020
Um,

37
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,770
it's um,

38
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:09,101
there,

39
00:01:09,101 --> 00:01:10,120
there are these um,

40
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:10,630
uh,

41
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,600
it's a super green supplement
that you can add to your,

42
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:13,870
uh,

43
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,703
your diet.

44
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,950
And just automatically get a lot more
phytonutrients and a lot more vegetable

45
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:23,950
matter and all the good shit that comes
from alkaline forming vitamins and

46
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:24,670
minerals.

47
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:25,660
Could have just had a VA.

48
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,501
I have that too.

49
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:29,020
Well I have a massive a
Kale shake in the morning,

50
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,860
but I also take it with that just to
give it an extra kick in the Dick.

51
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,990
And then I throw some Alpha Brandon there.

52
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:36,910
I also throw some,

53
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:37,390
um,

54
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:37,691
uh,

55
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:38,590
I tweeted it today.

56
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,670
I instagrammed it.

57
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,160
I throw some fish oil in there as well.

58
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:42,861
And a,

59
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:44,740
a multipack a pack of,

60
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:45,574
um,

61
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,413
I take,

62
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,390
I think it's called the things
they called true athletes,

63
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:50,770
Super Pac or something like that.

64
00:01:50,771 --> 00:01:53,010
But it's a really good common atory,

65
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,090
a little package of essential nutrients.

66
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,110
All this stuff that I talk about
except for the vitamin pack.

67
00:01:59,111 --> 00:02:00,390
We're going to have
vitamin packs eventually.

68
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,150
We don't have it yet.

69
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,020
We're working on that shit.

70
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:04,960
We just trying to get put together the
best formulation possible when it comes

71
00:02:04,961 --> 00:02:09,190
to a vitamin packs and we don't want
to fuck it up the first time out of the

72
00:02:09,191 --> 00:02:09,431
gate.

73
00:02:09,431 --> 00:02:10,021
So we're,

74
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:15,021
we're doing our diligence just like we
are with this a testosterone supplement

75
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:15,851
that we just released.

76
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:18,070
T plus we talked about
doing this for a long time,

77
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,180
but we wanted to make sure that,

78
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,291
first of all,

79
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,030
is there anything out there
that actually does help?

80
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,811
And it turns out yes,

81
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:23,201
there is.

82
00:02:23,201 --> 00:02:28,090
There's some stuff called magnesium
aspartic acid that has been shown in at

83
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:31,810
least one test to increase
free testosterone by 42%.

84
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,160
That's fascinating stuff.

85
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,240
Um,

86
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,580
it also has this stuff called Long Jack.

87
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,530
Um,

88
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,140
uh,

89
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,750
and a couple of the different
ingredients that are,

90
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,670
that help elevate natural
dopamine levels and uh,

91
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,900
allow your body to produce
its own testosterone at a
slightly elevated levels,

92
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:53,740
slightly being as high as 42%
of this study is different.

93
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,040
Between that and taking
syn synthetic testosterone,

94
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,390
like people that are
taking testosterone shots,

95
00:02:59,391 --> 00:03:02,150
you're probably taking
100% of what your body,

96
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:07,180
maybe 200% of what your body is a is
experiencing if you have low test levels.

97
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,360
So this is not,

98
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,880
it's not that strong,

99
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,710
but it is natural.

100
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,910
And the difference being,

101
00:03:13,911 --> 00:03:15,710
it's not going to shut
down your endocrine system.

102
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:19,070
It's not going to shut down your own
body's ability to produce hormones.

103
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,173
And um,

104
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:20,780
you know,

105
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,410
that's a,

106
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,221
that's what you want.

107
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:25,760
Until we can figure out how to turn
people into robots and that's coming.

108
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,720
Okay,

109
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,170
so just no,

110
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,491
no,

111
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:29,324
that's on the way.

112
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,890
There's a lot of other
cool supplements there.

113
00:03:30,891 --> 00:03:31,461
If you go to o,

114
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,440
n n I t use a code name,

115
00:03:33,441 --> 00:03:34,130
Rogan,

116
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,630
he will save yourself 10%
off any and all seven events.

117
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,120
That does not include all
the fitness equipment,

118
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,590
which we just got a new supplier of
kettle bells in their fucking Badass.

119
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,610
Jamie had to wrestle him out of the box.

120
00:03:46,611 --> 00:03:47,320
Yeah.

121
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,730
Are we ever going to have the secret ones?

122
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:49,720
Yes.

123
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,430
They're working on it,

124
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:50,930
son.

125
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:51,763
Shit takes time.

126
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,580
You gotta go to China.

127
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,310
You want to go to China?

128
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,143
It's a long way.

129
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,640
Go to China.

130
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,390
I will be,

131
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,320
if you want me to go there,

132
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:57,790
I would tell him Brian,

133
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,990
I would love to get a lot of work.

134
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,833
Yeah.

135
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,110
O n n I t end socket.

136
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,070
All right.

137

Had the music.

138
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,090
All right.

139
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,160

Oh yeah.

or we're having a death squad show there.

143

surprises to be announced soon.

so that sounds like a great show.

162
00:04:30,931 --> 00:04:33,660
It's a great fucking club that American
comedy company has just set up.

163
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:34,171
Perfect.

164
00:04:34,171 --> 00:04:35,640
Beautiful downtown.

165
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,240
Well,

166
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,073

169
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:38,980
was it a slight at gaslight?

170
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,370
Gosh,

171
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,260
it's so crazy dope area.

172
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:45,250
So it's such a cool little spot number
to see if I can get a video DJ to open it

173
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:45,520
up,

174
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:45,990
uh,

175
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,420
with,

176
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,940
which is the guy that cuts
videos live instead of deejaying.

177
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,080
Whoa.

178
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,590
Okay.

179
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,670
I've never even heard of that before.

180
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,040
Yeah,

181
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,900
it's David.

182
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:53,080
Uh,

183
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,030
David did remember we interviewed David,

184
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:55,510
uh,

185
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,460
the artist David or David Cho.

186
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:57,770
Yeah,

187
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,480
she does that too.

188
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:58,920
Yeah.

189
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,220
Oh,

190
00:04:59,220 --> 00:04:59,360
no,

191
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,500
no,

192
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,220
he doesn't do that.

193
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:00,371
No,

194
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:00,911
he doesn't do that.

195
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:01,121
I'm like,

196
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:01,331
God,

197
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:02,164
I'm making shit up man.

198
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,250
This motherfucker,

199
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,810
he making shit up again.

200
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:05,620
Can you believe what I have to,

201
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:05,981
Oh my God,

202
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:06,281
I'm sorry.

203
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:06,460
No,

204
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,230
we had this guy on this
desk squad podcast.

205
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,981
Oh,

206
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:09,311
okay.

207
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:11,350
Was it a Kevin Pereira
and podcast Kevin prayer,

208
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,371
the gentleman's name.

209
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:12,791
Do you remember?

210
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:13,624
I can't remember right now.

211
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,153
Mike relm.

212
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,570
Okay.

213
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:15,810
Yeah,

214
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,643
you're fine.

215
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:22,210
Friday night the freak party pulls
into Anaheim the grove in Anaheim,

216
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,320
Joey Diaz and Wa.

217
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,430
And uh,

218
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,600
so that's tomorrow night.

219
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,580
We were fucking fired up.

220
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,230
It's,

221
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,080
it's going to be great.

222
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,243
I'm fired up.

223
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,740
I love working with Joey in Anaheim.

224
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,340
Anaheim is where the UFC is at.

225
00:05:37,341 --> 00:05:38,030
So,

226
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:38,391
uh,

227
00:05:38,391 --> 00:05:41,420
I'm doing the weigh ins and then right
after the winds were going out and doing

228
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:42,230
the show.

229
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,791
So that's,

230
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:43,400
um,

231
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,320
Friday night Anaheim the grove.

232
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,430
Dana White's on the way,

233
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,270
but fuck it.

234
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,781
We're starting.

235
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:48,370
Anyway.

236
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,470
Role is Brian

237
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,290
the Joe Rogan experience.

238
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,160
Joe Rogan by night all day.

239
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,110
Well,

240
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,420
we're waiting right now
for Dana white to show up.

241
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:05,931
He,

242
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:06,380
uh,

243
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:06,681
took,

244
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:06,900
uh,

245
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,690
a car from Anaheim.

246
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,600
And if you know anything about
California Southern California,

247
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,250
Los Angeles in particular,

248
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:14,930
it's a fucking mess.

249
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,890
The highway is the most ridiculous
shit you've ever seen in your life.

250
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,170
It's been ridiculous
ever since I moved here.

251
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:22,400
I moved here in 94,

252
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:27,401
but it's gotten steadily and steadily
more ridiculous to the point where it's,

253
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,660
it doesn't make any sense.

254
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:29,961
It's like,

255
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:30,860
you can't fix this.

256
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:32,030
This is just Ooh,

257
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,960
way too many people for that amount of
road and Anaheim's like on one side of

258
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:36,590
La,

259
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,020
then we're on and it's rush hour.

260
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,213
I don't even know what he's,

261
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,450
he's not gonna be here for hours.

262
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,670
He's been in the car ready for an hour
and 40 minutes to call me at five.

263
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:47,210
Oh eight.

264
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,350
It's six 40 now.

265
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:49,940
So he's almost an hour and 40 minutes.

266
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:50,661
Yeah,

267
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:51,051
he's,

268
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:51,500
um,

269
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,450
you're fucked when you
try to get anywhere,

270
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,250
especially down to Orange County.

271
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,450
Jesus Christ,

272
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,280
that drive is insane.

273
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:02,360
Those poor people that live in Orange
County and then work in La and do that

274
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:03,194
every day.

275
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,060
I know somebody who does
San Diego every day.

276
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,451
No,

277
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:08,340
you don't say who the fuck is
that and what's wrong with you?

278
00:07:08,341 --> 00:07:09,174
Go now.

279
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:09,681
Okay,

280
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:10,514
what's wrong with him?

281
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,100
Why doesn't he get a place here or there?

282
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,530
I think somewhere does.

283
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,820
I think he works down in San Diego.

284
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:17,870
Well,

285
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,010
I guess you've got to
do what you gotta do it,

286
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:20,510
but that's two and a half hours each way.

287
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:20,990
Right?

288
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,550
That's five hours of driving a day.

289
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,870
How's your car not gonna explode

290
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,350
or your anger?

291
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,880
You could go crazy.

292
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:29,714
I do Kevin

293
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,980
being once every four months.

294
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:31,550
Right?

295
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,540
And every time I do it,

296
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:32,871
I just,

297
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:33,920
I'm amazed.

298
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:39,190
I left my house at 6:00 AM and I was
in bumper to bumper traffic at 6:00 AM.

299
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:41,571
I was like,

300
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:43,970
you've gotta be fucking shitting me.

301
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,480
The you are just asking
for people to go crazy.

302
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,261
You know,

303
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:50,060
and people who don't see that,

304
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:53,720
like fellow Comedians who don't get
up in the morning like you could,

305
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,710
you could be unaware of the
dangers of your environment.

306
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,290
Whereas if you were in that
pressure cooker every day,

307
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:05,291
driving around every day in
that insane stressful situation,

308
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,910
just insane levels of stress,

309
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:08,930
day in day out,

310
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:10,220
Chinese water torture,

311
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,840
monotonous fucking break lights and
gas fumes until you're ready to just go

312
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:19,580
fucking crazy and just drive your car
off the side of the four oh five fuck

313
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:20,414
that.

314
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,970
How many people out there are
like that dude from falling?

315
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:25,440
Oh,

316
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,070
Michael Douglas.

317
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,251
Yeah,

318
00:08:26,251 --> 00:08:27,084
I remember that Shit.

319
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,200
I Dunno.

320
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,690
People they really
identified with that movie.

321
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,111
Yeah.

322
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,540
I think there's a lot of people
with huge anger problems.

323
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,440
I want to say the person's name,

324
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:35,580
but this guy last night it was,

325
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,600
I was talking to,

326
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,550
I mean the rage in him.

327
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,001
I was just like,

328
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:39,380
Holy Hell,

329
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,130
you have a built up anger.

330
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,113
Like I don't,

331
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:42,961
I've built up anger,

332
00:08:42,961 --> 00:08:45,240
but my anger is always just like that guy.

333
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:46,074
I fucking hate him,

334
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,100
but not to the point where I'm like,

335
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,390
I won't kill him.

336
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,680
He is my last,

337
00:08:49,681 --> 00:08:52,320
well usually when you
find the misplaced anger,

338
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,390
you also fly.

339
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,190
Find a life that's a wreck.

340
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:55,610
Yeah.

341
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,220
Like almost

342
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,760
always I give the anger doesn't match the,

343
00:08:58,761 --> 00:09:00,180
the actual situation.

344
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:04,470
It's like they're using that situation
as a focus because focusing on their own

345
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:05,970
life is just too fucked up.

346
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:07,010
It's too confusing.

347
00:09:07,011 --> 00:09:09,300
It's too much failure
and bullshit in there.

348
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:09,630
I was like,

349
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,463
why do that?

350
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,250
Let's get mad at him and then all of
a sudden that person becomes the issue

351
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,880
instead of their own fucked
up psychological disorder.

352
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:18,811
Slash.

353
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:19,644
Personality.

354
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,320
You know that's usually whenever,

355
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,360
whenever is imbalanced,

356
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,540
imbalanced amount of hate that
someone will show towards you.

357
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,530
That's a,

358
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,640
that's because they're
not looking at that.

359
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:30,810
I won't south.

360
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,300
So take a look at your own self son.

361
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,060
Don't be getting mad at external sources.

362
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,250
You've got some bitch ass genetics.

363
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:39,810
You got something fucking with you.

364
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,470
I need to get that mirror and
have a sit down in front of it.

365
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,260
This Alyssa lamb thing is,

366
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,591
that's her name.

367
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:48,030
The woman that would
come in in the elevator.

368
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,920
Don't show that video man,

369
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:50,830
cause it bums me out.

370
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:51,531
It's scary,

371
00:09:51,531 --> 00:09:51,711
right?

372
00:09:51,711 --> 00:09:52,341
It's not scary.

373
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,174
It's creepy.

374
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,740
You want to know what it is,

375
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:55,190
folks?

376
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,130
The video is that girl,

377
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,300
if you haven't heard of her,

378
00:09:59,301 --> 00:10:01,100
she was from,

379
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:01,851
where was she from?

380
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,410
Canada over Vancouver.

381
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:05,870
I think she was from Canada and she was,

382
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,380
uh,

383
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,400
in Los Angeles,

384
00:10:07,401 --> 00:10:09,770
apparently by herself and someone killed.

385
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,120
Did,

386
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,290
did they ever say what she was here for?

387
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,510
Like what she's just visiting
or was she just like,

388
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,290
no.

389
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:15,600
Well,

390
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,161
you know what,

391
00:10:16,161 --> 00:10:17,480
they didn't even say someone killed her.

392
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,730
They said they found her
body in a water cistern.

393
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:20,391
But I mean,

394
00:10:20,391 --> 00:10:20,781
who knows,

395
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:22,280
maybe she fucking climbed inside of it.

396
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,250
Maybe we're jumping to conclusions
and maybe she was crazy.

397
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,413
I don't know.

398
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:26,661
You know,

399
00:10:26,661 --> 00:10:27,530
we don't really know.

400
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,400
Um,

401
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:28,881
but it's a,

402
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:29,714
it's a very sad,

403
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,590
it's very unfortunate.

404
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,380
And the elevator videos weird because
not only is like the elevator not working

405
00:10:35,381 --> 00:10:37,600
and she's looks like she's
hiding from somebody,

406
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,680
but then she starts doing like this
weird trippy arm thing that it looks like

407
00:10:41,681 --> 00:10:46,150
she's either on drugs or if she's
possessed by the devil or something.

408
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:46,911
Yeah.

409
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,140
That's what's fucked up about it.

410
00:10:48,141 --> 00:10:49,940
It's like a Guillermo del Toro movie.

411
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:50,600
Like,

412
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:50,870
you know,

413
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,120
it's like you're watching
paranormal activities.

414
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,520
Not that that's a
Guillermo del Toro movie,

415
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,230
but I just saw that mama movie.

416
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:57,621
So it's,

417
00:10:57,621 --> 00:10:58,490
that shits on my head.

418
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,380
The Mama Mama,

419
00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:02,900
the De Toro horror movie.

420
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,323
Yeah.

421
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:05,870
It's fucking scary.

422
00:11:05,871 --> 00:11:06,381
It's legit.

423
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:07,200
Scary.

424
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,960
Glom on to del Toro is a bad motherfucker.

425
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,310
You ever see Pan's labyrinth?

426
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:10,940
Yes.

427
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,271
That's a great,

428
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:11,660
yeah,

429
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,230
it's wicked.

430
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,670
He's a very original,

431
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,170
very original and very interesting.

432
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,483
But um,

433
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,653
that uh,

434
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,351
that movie,

435
00:11:18,351 --> 00:11:19,184
if you,

436
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,430
if you look at this
elevator video footage,

437
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,030
you easily could be
something from a movie.

438
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,130
Did you imagine if someone
fake to fucking murder?

439
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:28,850
Yes.

440
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:29,590
Yeah.

441
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,100
A advertisement for the
next pair of normal,

442
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,050
like CNN was in bed with
paranormal activities and they,

443
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,973
they,

444
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,090
it's coming to that already,

445
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,880
that mermaid thing that they did on TV
where they pretended they actually had

446
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:45,440
fucking real married.

447
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,740
They made a documentary
that was a fake documentary.

448
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:52,850
They made it with actors playing apart
and at the end they had this like special

449
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,850
mermaid thing and you're like,

450
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:55,421
wait a minute,

451
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:56,500
what it is?

452
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:59,410
So obviously fake that like
apparently you watch though.

453
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:00,400
I didn't even watch it.

454
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,550
You Watch the whole thing thinking like
a lot of people thought it was like

455
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,070
people were saying they
were really mermaids.

456
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,910
Like if somebody was actually believing
they were really mermaids and so people

457
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:10,850
were tuning into it going,

458
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,740
what the fuck?

459
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,320
There's mermaids and this is like,

460
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,090
I think it was on the history channel.

461
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,630
What?

462
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:16,811
Yeah.

463
00:12:16,811 --> 00:12:18,850
Let me find out what mermaid special.

464
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:19,180
Hold on.

465
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:19,851
We'll net we're going to,

466
00:12:19,851 --> 00:12:20,684
hold on a second.

467
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,780
I need to find out what would it,

468
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,220
cause I'm talking a lot of shit.

469
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:25,930
I might defame the history channel,

470
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,650
but uh,

471
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,910
it was on one of those things,

472
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:28,390
man.

473
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:28,931
Mermaids,

474
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:29,201
video,

475
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:29,771
animal planet.

476
00:12:29,771 --> 00:12:30,581
It was on animal planet.

477
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:31,540
That's even crazier.

478
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,330
Okay.

479
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,163
It's a fucking,

480
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,260
it's the most ridiculous shit of all time.

481
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,300
Like they pretend that there
was a body found it a bit,

482
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,860
a mermaid's had been
attacked by a giant shark.

483
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:42,400
You know,

484
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,240
like they literally,

485
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:45,730
the Animal Planet made like a fake movie.

486
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:46,540
They made him,

487
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,770
they blurred the lines.

488
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:49,120
They went Gonzo on us.

489
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:49,631
You know,

490
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:51,790
they blurred the lines between journalism,

491
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:55,120
between documentaries and total fiction.

492
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,830
Like they created a,

493
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,220
like you special effects and shit.

494
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,530
So like anybody watching animal planet,

495
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,380
you're assuming you're getting reality.

496
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,210
The worst case scenario is Cesar Milan
is going to pretend a dog's more fucked

497
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:11,050
up than he really is.

498
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,800
You know,

499
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,800
you're not going to get a guy who's
showing you fucking fake mermaid footage.

500
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,780
Is he still doing the dog whisperer?

501
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,440
I don't know because I
can't talk about that.

502
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:25,370
But I know something crazy
about that guy that I don't,

503
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,140
it's not really public knowledge
but about one of his dogs.

504
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,610
And what about when was dogs?

505
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,463
I don't know.

506
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:37,070
I heard from somebody that okay that
he has a pimple that's on his show.

507
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:38,190
That's all the time.

508
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:38,851
You know,

509
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,920
like it's like his number
one dog and his pimp,

510
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:42,230
Yo,

511
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,310
he always is trying to type
to help you but like you know,

512
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,180
pimples and I rescued this pitbull,

513
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,981
this pit bull is now,

514
00:13:46,981 --> 00:13:47,330
look I,

515
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,990
it's great around children
and stuff like that.

516
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,860
And I heard that that
Pippo ended up eating his,

517
00:13:52,861 --> 00:13:55,770
one of his smaller dogs sometime ago.

518
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,850
Very common.

519
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,490
Yeah,

520
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,570
very common pool.

521
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,550
Pull up this mermaids,

522
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,750
the body found video and
prepare to shit your pants.

523
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,351
Okay.

524
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:07,480
Because this is some crazy avatar stuff.

525
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:08,500
I'm watching this now.

526
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:11,980
It is so ridiculous that this
was actually on animal planet

527
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,361
and it's a,

528
00:14:14,361 --> 00:14:19,340
a whale attacks or a shark attacks
a whale and front of this mermaid.

529
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:19,590
I mean,

530
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,220
this is the nuttiest fucking
thing you've ever seen.

531
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,770
It looks so unbelievably fake.

532
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,540
Oh,

533
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,800
that's super fake.

534
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,100
It looks so unbelievably fake.

535
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:32,701
This.

536
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:33,660
Yes,

537
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:34,523
yes,

538
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,041
dude.

539
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,210
Of course it's not real.

540
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,130
Look up.

541
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,450
Go to the animal planet.

542
00:14:39,451 --> 00:14:40,171
Web website,

543
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,930
animal.discovery.com look up mermaids.

544
00:14:42,931 --> 00:14:45,780
The body found it's a video
on the animal planet there.

545
00:14:45,781 --> 00:14:46,614
That's it.

546
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,890
Look at this ridiculous shit they
were showing an animal planet.

547
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:53,290
How many hillbillies or sitting
at home watching is going.

548
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:56,080
I'm telling you it is animal planet.

549
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,420
We are watching animal planet.

550
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,220
We're,

551
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,780
we are watching a fucking mermaid.

552
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:03,790
It's a real fucking mermaid.

553
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:04,601
Where's the video?

554
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:05,170
Play the video.

555
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,220
It's your Internet.

556
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,063
It's,

557
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,830
I've got it right here.

558
00:15:08,831 --> 00:15:09,620
I'm running it.

559
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:09,810
I,

560
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,650
that's probably why it's so dumb.

561
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:12,940
It's so dumb.

562
00:15:12,941 --> 00:15:14,050
It hurts my brain.

563
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,180
It looks so fake here.

564
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:16,321
I'll,

565
00:15:16,321 --> 00:15:17,051
I'll stop it.

566
00:15:17,051 --> 00:15:19,120
So maybe you'd be able to
get it right Internet here.

567
00:15:19,121 --> 00:15:19,954
So wack.

568
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,370
But only for a few more days.

569
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,960
It's going to be fixed in a,

570
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:23,794
in a week.

571
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,473
Um,

572
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,320
is this one of those things though?

573
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:27,981
Cause I know like,

574
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:28,221
you know,

575
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:28,840
like

576
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,673
here I'll kill mine.

577
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,590
The animal planet does
have reenactments a lot.

578
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:32,760
Yeah.

579
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,510
They're not killed mine
and now yours works.

580
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:34,850
Yeah.

581
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,430
When I feel like restricts ips
on if my cables that whack.

582
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,970
But is it just a reenactment?

583
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:41,804
Is that,

584
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,693
it's like saying,

585
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,570
I know,

586
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:48,080
are they saying this is real footage
or are they just showing it to you?

587
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:48,711
But the show notes,

588
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:48,990
you want it

589
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,250
animal planet,

590
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,451
you know,

591
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,980
so you're watching this and you go,

592
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,551
Whoa,

593
00:15:53,551 --> 00:15:54,001
okay,

594
00:15:54,001 --> 00:15:54,661
so watch this.

595
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:55,494
Here we go.

596
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,820
North America.

597
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:58,760
What are you doing there?

598
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,593
Falling out of here.

599
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,260
Why'd you press a zoom in?

600
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:02,760
Then you fuck it was fucked up.

601
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:05,871
So,

602
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:06,141
okay,

603
00:16:06,141 --> 00:16:07,400
you're looking at this right.

604
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,700
Cool place to them now

605
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,431
and you're going,

606
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:12,980
okay.

607
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,750
Um,

608
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,740
what am I saying here?

609
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,730
Is that a person you're like,

610
00:16:15,731 --> 00:16:16,564
what is this?

611
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,220
This looks like real water.

612
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,633
Okay,

613
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,850
fuck is this,

614
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:27,510
it's a fake fucking mermaid was a hit of
his pod before they make an open water

615
00:16:27,941 --> 00:16:28,774
crossing.

616
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,363
Look at this shit.

617
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,440
You're watching this
and you walk off stage.

618
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,590
He has him down into dark
water are feeding grounds.

619
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:37,923
It's kind of cool though.

620
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,920
Yeah.

621
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,910
Oh my God.

622
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:42,400
They really do have mermaids gather here.

623
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,000
Is this just trying to teach you
about the ocean if Merman sources.

624
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,143
Oh No.

625
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,440
See there's the big whale
shark that preys on them.

626
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,430
Sharp fucks up to as well.

627
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,660
And Look at the mermaid all freaked
out and Avatar like they're crazy.

628
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,680
X Ray eyes.

629
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,210
A shark is

630
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,100
a shark that eight Wales,

631
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,070
God damn mega dams a
shark that eight whales.

632
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,470
But look at that stupid
looking fake mermaid.

633
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,860
So this is on animal planet.

634
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,070
So it's just using the,

635
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,520
the Merman to teach you about stuff.

636
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,320
And like he just swimming around like,

637
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:24,531
look,

638
00:17:24,531 --> 00:17:25,730
this is what a shark looks like.

639
00:17:25,731 --> 00:17:26,630
If it eats a well,

640
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,250
that's it.

641
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,310
Learn something else today.

642
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,503
Yeah,

643
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,000
I guess I mean that,

644
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:33,470
that is exactly what it is.

645
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:34,601
What are they trying,

646
00:17:34,601 --> 00:17:36,380
I don't know what they're
trying to do the same.

647
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:37,630
We'll have mermaids exist.

648
00:17:37,631 --> 00:17:38,600
This is what they'd be like.

649
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,950
So we made a documentary.

650
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:43,910
Well we pretended that they were real
and we incorporated them into regular

651
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:44,744
world.

652
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,700
So like at one point in
time to where Mermaids,

653
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,110
so they're saying megalith don.

654
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:48,590
So the,

655
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,100
I guess what they're saying is,

656
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,640
let's pretend that back
when mega don was real,

657
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:55,870
there were also dolphins.

658
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,550
So you know what the problem is,

659
00:17:57,551 --> 00:17:58,384
man,

660
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,340
the fossil record is kind of tricky
because everything doesn't leave a fossil.

661
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,390
So they could pretend that
there was some fucking mermaids.

662
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,290
Cause it's not like we combed every
inch of the ocean looking for fish bones

663
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,390
that also have people faces.

664
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,430
We haven't really been
looking for that shit.

665
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,170
So they came up with this stupid thing.

666
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,480
Get to get answers.

667
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,523
Yeah.

668
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,513
Yeah.

669
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,820
Like I don't know what they were
thinking when they put that together.

670
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:25,481
Yeah.

671
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:25,551
The,

672
00:18:25,551 --> 00:18:25,820
it's a,

673
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,430
there's an article on Snoop's about it.

674
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:27,971
Snopes,

675
00:18:27,971 --> 00:18:28,751
Snopes.

676
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:29,860
Snoops snoop.

677
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,050
Snoop sounds better than than Snopes.

678
00:18:32,051 --> 00:18:34,570
Like I've been snooping around
and I found out the answers wrong.

679
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,720
Snopes like Oh snoot it
would've Snopes mean.

680
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:38,620
I don't know.

681
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,310
Maybe I'm right.

682
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,090
Maybe it's snoops.

683
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,770
I don't think it a person
who wants to build it.

684
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,140
How would they miss the Palette?

685
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,690
Fuck is wrong with you guys.

686
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:45,524
An idiot.

687
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,910
Silly that that Burbank
thing is so stupid.

688
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:50,930
Like I told you about this,

689
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,720
the rich guy that I know that has a,

690
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:52,990
he's,

691
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,050
he's a Merman.

692
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,680
He's trying,

693
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:59,180
he hasn't tried and he has actually has
a trident and his wife is a mermaid and

694
00:18:59,181 --> 00:18:59,961
they have a fucking,

695
00:18:59,961 --> 00:19:01,880
the whole like their their wall.

696
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:03,650
They have a monstrous house.

697
00:19:03,651 --> 00:19:04,130
Okay.

698
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:09,130
It's guys like a multibillionaire and
they have this monstrous house where I'm

699
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,840
like one side like the entryway.

700
00:19:11,841 --> 00:19:13,820
Like cause you enter into
the house as a mural.

701
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:16,911
Yeah,

702
00:19:16,911 --> 00:19:18,500
he owns like some big companies,

703
00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:18,780
man,

704
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,380
like haircare products or some shit.

705
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,581
That's hilarious.

706
00:19:22,581 --> 00:19:23,414
He's a baller though.

707
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,800
Like old school.

708
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,890
My old time baller painting
himself on the wall.

709
00:19:27,891 --> 00:19:28,724
I was like Greek.

710
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,163
My uncle,

711
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,460
my uncle and my aunt,

712
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,100
they have there so like a proper,

713
00:19:34,101 --> 00:19:34,641
like they're very,

714
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:34,870
they,

715
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:38,180
their whole house is really decorated
nice and everything and they both have,

716
00:19:38,181 --> 00:19:38,451
you know,

717
00:19:38,451 --> 00:19:38,981
real jobs.

718
00:19:38,981 --> 00:19:41,380
Like he's an accountant or
something like that and,

719
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:41,901
and,

720
00:19:41,901 --> 00:19:46,670
but yet he has this taste for really
creepy artwork and like you go into each

721
00:19:46,671 --> 00:19:46,941
room,

722
00:19:46,941 --> 00:19:48,140
it's just a big one,

723
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:48,470
uh,

724
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,280
one with a big Bush hanging out like a
painting of a really beautiful painting.

725
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,710
But then like over there in their kitchen,

726
00:19:54,711 --> 00:19:57,260
they have another pain where a woman
just sitting there with her butthole

727
00:19:57,261 --> 00:20:01,070
exposed and it's just
like as a kid I was a kid,

728
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:01,701
I was always like,

729
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:02,534
what stuff?

730
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:07,700
Like my mom couldn't say like cover your
eyes cause every single room was that.

731
00:20:07,701 --> 00:20:11,510
And then you go to the bathroom and I
remember being like a 10 year old or not

732
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:11,811
even that,

733
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:15,230
maybe an 11 year old and like going to
the bathroom in his magazines next to the

734
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,800
toilet,

735
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,720
we're all playboys.

736
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,480
I'm like,

737
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,540
I would go to the bathroom like 15
times a day and they just had an open,

738
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,430
it was awesome.

739
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,170
He is a freak.

740
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,700
They do as a freak and it's
always those accountant types,

741
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,300
you know,

742
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,220
they're all buttoned down and
shit and then they get home.

743
00:20:27,221 --> 00:20:28,480
They're just staring
at but holds this look,

744
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:28,640
it's,

745
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,290
it's art.

746
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,123
It's art.

747
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,150
You could do anything.

748
00:20:31,151 --> 00:20:35,020
It's like calling it art as long
as you like make it kind of crafty,

749
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,380
make it like shiny and slippery
and black and white and weird.

750
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:38,561
You know,

751
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:39,430
you can have a bottle.

752
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,120
Yeah.

753
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,781
It doesn't matter.

754
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:41,561
It's still above all.

755
00:20:41,561 --> 00:20:42,520
If you're looking to beat off,

756
00:20:42,521 --> 00:20:43,354
it's right there.

757
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,790
If you've ever seen doctor Kevorkian is,

758
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,700
aren't I pull it,

759
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,270
pull that

760
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:48,720
up.

761
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,270
Because that's when I turned
the corner on Doctor Kevorkian.

762
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,260
I thought like doctor Kevorkian.

763
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:53,611
I said,

764
00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:53,761
well,

765
00:20:53,761 --> 00:20:54,151
you know what?

766
00:20:54,151 --> 00:20:56,940
This guy's very noble
and what he's doing is,

767
00:20:56,941 --> 00:20:57,480
uh,

768
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:57,811
you know,

769
00:20:57,811 --> 00:21:01,650
he's helping people that are terminally
ill and they're in constant pain and

770
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:01,951
he's,

771
00:21:01,951 --> 00:21:02,460
uh,

772
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,990
he's giving them a noble way out.

773
00:21:03,991 --> 00:21:04,501
And I think,

774
00:21:04,501 --> 00:21:04,711
you know,

775
00:21:04,711 --> 00:21:05,411
fuck the government.

776
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:08,850
If we're going after this guy and then
I saw some of his paintings and I was

777
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:09,090
like,

778
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:09,421
okay,

779
00:21:09,421 --> 00:21:10,890
this guy is fuck,

780
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,120
ah man,

781
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,310
this guy is fucked up.

782
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,340
Kevorkian did some like dark shit.

783
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:18,570
Look at that picture.

784
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,800
Oh look at that picture.

785
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:23,010
He's got a guy who has no head.

786
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:23,850
Okay.

787
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:24,780
And he's got,

788
00:21:24,781 --> 00:21:29,130
his head is on the table in a plate
with an apple and its mouth like a pig,

789
00:21:29,131 --> 00:21:29,311
you know,

790
00:21:29,311 --> 00:21:30,300
ping us an apple in his mouth.

791
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,750
So he's holding up a fork and
a knife while he's got no head.

792
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,060
And then behind him it's
like back back it up.

793
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:39,330
So everybody could say behind him it
looks like some Aztec warrior or something

794
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:40,290
like that it looks like.

795
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:40,990
Yeah,

796
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:41,823
like

797
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,111
yeah,

798
00:21:43,111 --> 00:21:44,620
it's like a Roman or you know,

799
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,230
I guess it's supposed to represent that
someone did something horrendous to this

800
00:21:49,231 --> 00:21:52,350
person is now propping them
up in jest or something.

801
00:21:52,351 --> 00:21:53,071
I don't know what this is.

802
00:21:53,071 --> 00:21:54,290
The road war helmet,

803
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,650
which is weird because this is like,

804
00:21:55,651 --> 00:21:55,951
you know,

805
00:21:55,951 --> 00:21:57,510
obviously from a different,

806
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,433
yeah,

807
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,161
different areas.

808
00:21:59,161 --> 00:21:59,971
Bullets in this one.

809
00:21:59,971 --> 00:22:03,150
There's like little bombs here and then
it looks like a bunch of crosses and

810
00:22:03,151 --> 00:22:04,550
Jewish stars.

811
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,370
Maybe.

812
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,480
It's very weird.

813
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:06,661
Okay.

814
00:22:06,661 --> 00:22:07,140
Stars.

815
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:07,531
He's,

816
00:22:07,531 --> 00:22:09,750
he had a lot of very weird stuff.

817
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:10,620
Um,

818
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,970
and you just look at that and go,

819
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:12,830
okay,

820
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,790
like are you enjoying
killing these people?

821
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,130
Like you know,

822
00:22:17,131 --> 00:22:17,911
like look at the,

823
00:22:17,911 --> 00:22:19,440
pulled that one next to the skull.

824
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,290
You see the one next to the scope
to the one to the left of that?

825
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:22,910
Yeah.

826
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:23,120
The,

827
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,731
the one in the middle.

828
00:22:23,731 --> 00:22:23,941
Yeah.

829
00:22:23,941 --> 00:22:25,380
Wait these few that,

830
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,340
what's this like what is this guy saying?

831
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,260
What the fuck is this guy saying?

832
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,133
Brotherhood.

833
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:32,850
Yeah.

834
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,940
He's got like a vampire in the center.

835
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:41,130
It's a black guy and there's like a guy
who's wearing a suit and the the neck of

836
00:22:42,931 --> 00:22:45,840
the suit is a vampire and
evil vampire and the wreck,

837
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,430
I mean it's like a DMT trip.

838
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:47,880
Yeah.

839
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,050
It's really weird.

840
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:49,770
Wow.

841
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:50,221
Look at this.

842
00:22:50,221 --> 00:22:52,890
It's like some of it is kind of cool,

843
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:53,551
you know,

844
00:22:53,551 --> 00:22:56,250
like the skull one in the middle
doesn't really freak me out.

845
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:56,521
I go,

846
00:22:56,521 --> 00:22:56,970
okay,

847
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,410
well the guy dealt with death.

848
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,590
I mean that is a,

849
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:03,480
an accurate representation
of skull and some bones.

850
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:04,770
Nothing wrong with that,

851
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,040
but the guy eating his own fucking head,

852
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,530
you don't want to play like what is,

853
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:11,680
okay.

854
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,190
And what is the one to
the far right above there?

855
00:23:14,191 --> 00:23:14,700
This one.

856
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,930
What's the one where it
looks like an old man?

857
00:23:15,931 --> 00:23:17,790
This naked c the one.

858
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:18,121
Ah,

859
00:23:18,121 --> 00:23:18,954
Shit.

860
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,213
Okay.

861
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:20,910
The One?

862
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:21,240
Yeah.

863
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,790
Up in the top and not next to that one.

864
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:24,540
This one?

865
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:24,811
Yeah.

866
00:23:24,811 --> 00:23:25,500
What is that?

867
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,190
Oh,

868
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,360
Jesus Christ.

869
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,613
What does that,

870
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,753
oops.

871
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,360
All right.

872
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,930
Good outline that's going to show it.

873
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:33,280
Yeah.

874
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,600
What is this?

875
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,670
He's like showing someone dying.

876
00:23:36,671 --> 00:23:41,671
It's called fever fever for the
flavor of a Pringles beaver for seven.

877
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:43,610
He could,

878
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,250
but he's got a guy

879
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,730
with holding an arm and
his body is breaking apart.

880
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:50,810
He's holding his own arm.

881
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,310
His body's breaking apart on him.

882
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,173
Wow.

883
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,130
Yeah.

884
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:55,641
I don't remember.

885
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:57,980
That's one of the ones that
I thought was really dark.

886
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,050
Like what's going on with that guy?

887
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,410
This Santa Claus is stepping on a baby.

888
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,460
Is that the scarecrow?

889
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:04,731
Yeah.

890
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:05,960
Santa Claus is stepping out.

891
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:06,561
What was that?

892
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:07,100
A pig.

893
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:07,311
Oh no,

894
00:24:07,311 --> 00:24:08,480
that's the baby Jesus.

895
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:08,751
No.

896
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:09,490
What is that?

897
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:09,910
No,

898
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,240
it's baby [inaudible] baby.

899
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,190
[inaudible] Christ Jesus Christ.

900
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:13,790
Okay.

901
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:17,360
What the fuck this guy really did draw.

902
00:24:17,361 --> 00:24:18,350
That is a baby.

903
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:21,470
He drew Santa Clauses boot
coming out of a chimney.

904
00:24:21,471 --> 00:24:22,520
Squashing a baby.

905
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:23,030
First of all,

906
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,430
who the fuck puts a baby in a fireplace?

907
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,960
That's a manner baby.

908
00:24:26,961 --> 00:24:27,800
Jesus manner.

909
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:31,820
But it's a fireplace and the
main church main drizen baby.

910
00:24:31,821 --> 00:24:33,230
Jesus Jewish.

911
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,060
Why don't you let us
see the whole picture?

912
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,020
Pope making a full screen
because the resolutions.

913
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:39,390
Good.

914
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,600
Know that image.

915
00:24:40,601 --> 00:24:41,750
What does that thing to the left?

916
00:24:41,751 --> 00:24:42,730
That a scarecrow.

917
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:44,621
Yeah.

918
00:24:44,621 --> 00:24:46,240
You can't draw boots.

919
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,440
Stepping on babies.

920
00:24:47,441 --> 00:24:48,820
You fucking Weirdo.

921
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:49,990
Why are you drawing that?

922
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:50,420
See,

923
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,220
here's the rest of the
wise men up here going.

924
00:24:52,221 --> 00:24:53,240
Where'd that baby go?

925
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,550
So it's a combination of Santa Claus and

926
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:57,850
wizard of Oz.

927
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,260
Like that's a Zombie.

928
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,123
What is that?

929
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,080
Is that a party hat on that motherfucker?

930
00:25:02,081 --> 00:25:02,914
What is that?

931
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,173
If a dunce hat,

932
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:06,783
is it a downside?

933
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,290
He was weird,

934
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:08,651
man.

935
00:25:08,651 --> 00:25:11,680
He was a weird fuck that guy's
got a leaf over his dick though.

936
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,500
Good play could play Jackie,

937
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,610
that nobody wants to see
it die in Guy's Dick.

938
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,700
You could step on a baby
that's all well and good,

939
00:25:18,701 --> 00:25:20,620
but put a leaf over his penis.

940
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,430
Like what is it?

941
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,720
What is he trying to say?

942
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:23,861
You know,

943
00:25:23,861 --> 00:25:24,331
and in the clouds,

944
00:25:24,331 --> 00:25:25,510
this killing religion.

945
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:25,811
Well,

946
00:25:25,811 --> 00:25:26,770
when I saw some of that,

947
00:25:26,771 --> 00:25:28,510
that's when I sort of turned
the corner on that cat.

948
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,111
I was like,

949
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:29,440
wow,

950
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,390
maybe there's more to the
story than meets the eye.

951
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:31,961
Maybe,

952
00:25:31,961 --> 00:25:32,171
you know.

953
00:25:32,171 --> 00:25:32,561
I was like,

954
00:25:32,561 --> 00:25:36,160
well maybe this guy like met
somebody and it probably was that,

955
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,200
that saw somebody who
desperately needed help,

956
00:25:38,201 --> 00:25:40,720
but maybe also on Gerard it a little bit,

957
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,240
you know,

958
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,130
it looks like he might've had a,

959
00:25:44,131 --> 00:25:44,400
uh,

960
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,730
a taste for the McCobb.

961
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:46,970
Yeah.

962
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:47,190
Yeah.

963
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:47,371
I mean,

964
00:25:47,371 --> 00:25:48,540
you pretty much draw what you like.

965
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:49,560
Yeah.

966
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,140
That's what you drew.

967
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,690
You always used to draw
monsters and stuff.

968
00:25:51,691 --> 00:25:53,340
I used to draw boobs and eyeballs.

969
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:53,620
Yeah.

970
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,590
But the difference is I wasn't

971
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,580
killing people while I was doing it,

972
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,323
you know?

973
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,410
I mean,

974
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,900
I guess the guy has every right
to express himself like that,

975
00:26:01,901 --> 00:26:06,790
but I was doing it because I loved monster
movies and I was 14 this guy's 80 and

976
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:09,070
he's a doctor who kills people and he's,

977
00:26:09,071 --> 00:26:09,430
you know,

978
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,690
painting people with no heads.

979
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:11,830
I mean,

980
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,100
I guess he could do whatever you want.

981
00:26:13,101 --> 00:26:13,751
It's just art,

982
00:26:13,751 --> 00:26:14,021
right?

983
00:26:14,021 --> 00:26:14,171
I mean,

984
00:26:14,171 --> 00:26:18,220
what kind of a hypocrite would I be to
say that there's any difference between

985
00:26:18,221 --> 00:26:20,770
what he's doing and what
Guillermo del Toro is doing?

986
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,910
He's just creating art.

987
00:26:21,911 --> 00:26:22,840
This is his own art.

988
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:23,621
You know,

989
00:26:23,621 --> 00:26:25,170
I don't think we're all,

990
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,990
the tour really believes this is some
fucking dead lady who lives in a cabin who

991
00:26:28,991 --> 00:26:29,451
kills you in a,

992
00:26:29,451 --> 00:26:30,410
raises your babies.

993
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,770
There's this really awesome artists
that just got turned onto names.

994
00:26:33,771 --> 00:26:35,730
So eat milk and look at this.

995
00:26:35,731 --> 00:26:37,230
This is just a painting
she did the other day,

996
00:26:37,231 --> 00:26:39,030
but look how crazy it is.

997
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:40,430
It looks so realistic.

998
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:42,420
Like when people can paint,

999
00:26:42,421 --> 00:26:43,254
I can get it.

1000
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,030
Oh Great.

1001
00:26:45,031 --> 00:26:45,864
Here.

1002
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,131
But like,

1003
00:26:47,131 --> 00:26:48,120
it's like her face,

1004
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:48,190
he,

1005
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,460
it's hard to get a close
up on these Twitter photos,

1006
00:26:50,461 --> 00:26:51,700
but see,

1007
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,670
but I check it out on Twitter.

1008
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,840
How do you know this person?

1009
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,640
I just got turned onto her art and
that's how so you don't know or just know

1010

Alright.

1012
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,740
And then Kelly tell anything.

1013
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,670
Just look okay.

1014
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,810
It looks like good stuff.

1015
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:04,250
Yeah,

1016
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,900
but I see tidies c to d.

1017
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,081
Oh,

1018
00:27:07,081 --> 00:27:07,440
that's it.

1019
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:07,861
Titties.

1020
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:11,660
That's what it was today is a senior girl.

1021
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,140
Yeah,

1022
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:13,973
it was titties.

1023
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,813
It was

1024
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,350
a senior girl bottom.

1025
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,130
I wasn't something on the Internet,

1026
00:27:20,131 --> 00:27:20,431
remember?

1027
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:21,091
Cause it had something.

1028
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:21,221
Yeah,

1029
00:27:21,221 --> 00:27:21,370
yeah,

1030
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:21,600
yeah.

1031
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,500
That was part of it.

1032
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:24,900
That was eventually two days,

1033
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,130
two days.

1034
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,330
I can see your girlfriends,

1035
00:27:27,331 --> 00:27:29,880
butthole girls on the Internet.

1036
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:30,991
It was like you would,

1037
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:33,120
you would show of us tits all the time.

1038
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:33,600
Yeah.

1039
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,021
So,

1040
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:34,320
uh,

1041
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,153
like you would like,

1042
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,150
he would get pictures.

1043
00:27:36,151 --> 00:27:39,570
He was dating this girl that was like
a naked model and she would send them

1044
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,010
pictures of tests and go look.

1045
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,390
He just like stick them in your face.

1046
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,430
And then I just started a song,

1047
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,540
ted to Hays,

1048
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,620
senior girl's butthole.

1049
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:49,631
Oh God,

1050
00:27:49,631 --> 00:27:50,650
what should we can remember that?

1051
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,020
Cause the real chorus was really catchy.

1052
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,913
It was funny.

1053
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,090
We were having fun.

1054
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,120
We were baked and we were were goofing
around and somehow or another it became a

1055
00:27:58,121 --> 00:28:00,430
song that like repeated itself
like a couple of months.

1056
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,293
I could see

1057
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,930
a senior girls bottle

1058
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:08,823
people at home ago.

1059
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,820
No,

1060
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,050
this is a classic example.

1061
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,980
Well have you guys be in stone and think
something's funny when it actually is

1062
00:28:13,981 --> 00:28:14,820
not funny at all.

1063
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,290
And to someone who is sober,

1064
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:17,041
it's really annoying.

1065
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:18,420
And that's what's annoying
about stone people.

1066
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:19,254
God dammit.

1067
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,240
That's what happens man.

1068
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,163
People get all,

1069
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,580
all agitated and shit agitated.

1070
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,150
That's when they find they
find agitation and stoners,

1071
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,790
Dana white has this thing
called McNear's disease.

1072
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:30,690
Have you ever heard of that shit?

1073
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,033
What's that?

1074
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,600
I mean maybe I'm not spelling it.

1075
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,850
E Er's disease.

1076
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,773
Um,

1077
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,360
it's spelled m e n.

1078
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,470
I.

1079
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:41,470
E.

1080
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:41,470
R.

1081
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,303
E McNear's disease.

1082
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:42,991
And,

1083
00:28:42,991 --> 00:28:43,620
uh,

1084
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,120
it has to do with,

1085
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:45,954
um,

1086
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:46,920
he had,

1087
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,940
he got kind of fight once with a bunch
of dudes and they beat him up and fucked

1088
00:28:50,941 --> 00:28:55,560
up his ear and now he gets like vertigo
attacks and like ringing in his ear.

1089
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,210
And you know what's a,

1090
00:28:57,211 --> 00:28:57,511
a,

1091
00:28:57,511 --> 00:28:58,470
a cure for this shit?

1092
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,230
Marijuana.

1093
00:28:59,230 --> 00:28:59,890
That's right.

1094
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:00,460
And as he tried,

1095
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,151
does he did marijuana?

1096
00:29:01,151 --> 00:29:01,401
Of course.

1097
00:29:01,401 --> 00:29:02,234
Dot.

1098
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,153
Has He ever done,

1099
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,080
we're going to have to hotbox
this motherfucker today.

1100
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,420
I think that's a great idea.

1101
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,181
Do we have any more joints,

1102
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:07,950
world?

1103
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,270
Uh,

1104
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:11,350
I might have one in my car car
and went out to go get that shit.

1105
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,270
I can't even have one in my car.

1106
00:29:13,271 --> 00:29:14,170
I don't have my car here.

1107
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,040
Fuck.

1108
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,191
Well,

1109
00:29:15,191 --> 00:29:16,030
there's an ashtray.

1110
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:19,690
There's at least 15 hits
here and he's asked Tracy,

1111
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,040
we can make it happen.

1112
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:21,990
We can hotbox him.

1113
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,000
What about after a hot box and we
might change Danowitz life today.

1114
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,010
What if we do one of
those things where like,

1115
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:27,760
uh,

1116
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,180
he,

1117
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:28,830
he puts it,

1118
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,480
I put it in his mouth and he
sucks on the other end of the day.

1119
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,620
Hey Jesus Christ,

1120
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:33,040
comma,

1121
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,270
a,

1122
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,103
you think he is?

1123
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,073
What's that called?

1124
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:35,923
It's called

1125
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,720
putting it in my mouth and suck on this.

1126
00:29:39,721 --> 00:29:42,870
Like what are you even say what
time of it's been Doug Benson?

1127
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,650
I was with Doug Benson
in this old Marin's,

1128
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:50,660
like puts it in his mouth and told him
no shock box and old man and he did it?

1129
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,663
No.

1130
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:53,683
Okay.

1131
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,473
Wow.

1132
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,620
I forgot all about that.

1133
00:29:56,621 --> 00:29:57,454
That's hilarious.

1134
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:57,821
Yeah,

1135
00:29:57,821 --> 00:29:58,840
dogs are silly bitch.

1136
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,550
I tweeted his picture,

1137
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:02,380
I was in Utah and uh,

1138
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,970
stopped in some best buy to pick up some
DVDs for the little ones so they can,

1139
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:07,420
uh,

1140
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:11,170
watch a Cinderella and shed cause you
get bored if you don't have like specific

1141
00:30:11,171 --> 00:30:12,190
shit that they enjoy.

1142
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:13,361
So,

1143
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:14,194
uh,

1144
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:14,711
we,

1145
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:15,011
uh,

1146
00:30:15,011 --> 00:30:17,800
I pulled in the spring and I saw Doug
Manson's picture and the comedy section.

1147
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,810
It's kind of cool and you're
in the middle of nowhere.

1148
00:30:19,811 --> 00:30:22,450
You don't know anybody and you walk into
a store and you see your friend's face.

1149
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,573
Ah,

1150
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,610
I know that dude.

1151
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,860
So I tweeted it right.

1152
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,180
But I instagrammed it.

1153
00:30:28,181 --> 00:30:29,320
And when I instagrammed it,

1154
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:30,154
you know how you put,

1155
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:30,700
uh,

1156
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:35,700
at Doug Benson will they cut out the
APP part when they poured it over from

1157
00:30:37,181 --> 00:30:38,350
Instagram to Twitter?

1158
00:30:38,351 --> 00:30:39,184
You know what that means?

1159
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,150
That means they're a douchebag.

1160
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:40,561
No,

1161
00:30:40,561 --> 00:30:44,550
it means that Doug Benson doesn't have
the name Doug Benson on Instagram.

1162
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:44,911
Right.

1163
00:30:44,911 --> 00:30:46,200
You know who does another guy.

1164
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,910
But there is a bug Benson on Instagram.

1165
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:48,960
But the difference,

1166
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,800
Oh Doug Benson on Twitter is different
so that when it goes to Twitter it's not

1167
00:30:52,801 --> 00:30:53,371
the same one.

1168
00:30:53,371 --> 00:30:55,400
So it doesn't give the
Hashtag confused people.

1169
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,221
Okay,

1170
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:57,031
that does make sense.

1171
00:30:57,031 --> 00:30:57,331
Actually.

1172
00:30:57,331 --> 00:30:58,650
That's actually a smart move.

1173
00:30:59,010 --> 00:30:59,551
But I,

1174
00:30:59,551 --> 00:30:59,851
you know,

1175
00:30:59,851 --> 00:31:04,680
I wanted it to be both Twitter and they
should give me that option if fucks.

1176
00:31:04,681 --> 00:31:06,060
It should be both because in,

1177
00:31:06,061 --> 00:31:11,061
in Instagram it goes to this other guy
and now I have to just say Doug Benson

1178
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,280
and so I can't ever Instagram
and tweet something.

1179
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:14,790
Right.

1180
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,200
Because if my Instagram and tweet it,

1181
00:31:16,201 --> 00:31:17,730
then it leaves that part out.

1182
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:18,943
Yeah.

1183
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,540
It's one of their problems.

1184
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:25,340
And that's because Instagram and Twitter
are two different companies so they

1185
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,470
don't play rent long that nicely.

1186
00:31:27,471 --> 00:31:32,030
I think somebody needs to pony up the
Cheddar and come up with that Instagram

1187
00:31:32,031 --> 00:31:32,870
money's dog.

1188
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,880
How much you think Instagram
is worth right now?

1189
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,421
I don't know.

1190
00:31:35,421 --> 00:31:35,841
Billions.

1191
00:31:35,841 --> 00:31:36,021
Right.

1192
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:36,910
Since vine came out,

1193
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,940
I haven't used it once.

1194
00:31:37,941 --> 00:31:39,230
So Brian,

1195
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,670
my own stock and vine.

1196
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,533
No,

1197
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,030
if I did I'd be rich as fuck.

1198
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:44,600
Yeah,

1199
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,670
I'm Matt Twitter.

1200
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,590
Matt stags just brought
up vine to me today.

1201
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,940
It's all the rage.

1202
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,500
The kids are all talking about it.

1203
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,710
Yeah but the problem is is that I find
myself vining cause I want to vine so

1204
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,950
much cause I want to play around with
it and want to try things and do things.

1205
00:31:57,951 --> 00:32:01,580
But now I'm not like one of these guys
that sit there and do 30 takes trying to

1206
00:32:01,581 --> 00:32:02,930
make the perfect vine and that,

1207
00:32:02,931 --> 00:32:03,410
you know,

1208
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,243
we don't have to.

1209
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,370
I know you're okay now you
can become a competitive,

1210
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:07,961
that's what it is.

1211
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:08,750
You're seen other guys.

1212
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:12,680
You're trying to get your shit and your
old video editing skills are coming

1213
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:13,160
back.

1214
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:13,311
Well,

1215
00:32:13,311 --> 00:32:13,941
I'm trying to be the best.

1216
00:32:13,941 --> 00:32:14,900
You tried to be the best at it.

1217
00:32:14,901 --> 00:32:15,140
Right?

1218
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,130
Well listen man,

1219
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,420
if you are a very talented video editor
and you don't do anything with it,

1220
00:32:20,421 --> 00:32:21,800
your videos that you did,

1221
00:32:21,801 --> 00:32:22,101
man,

1222
00:32:22,101 --> 00:32:22,860
when we were doing those

1223
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,250
desk squad videos and we were
doing the Joe show videos,

1224
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,820
you have some really
fucking cool video skills.

1225
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:30,850
I can tell you what killed it.

1226
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,490
I immediately tried know
the new final cut pro.

1227
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:33,980
Really?

1228
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,813
Yeah.

1229
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:35,710
It's too hard.

1230
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:35,981
No,

1231
00:32:35,981 --> 00:32:38,350
it's just the worst program in the road.

1232
00:32:38,351 --> 00:32:39,710
And I know I could buy old one,

1233
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:40,370
but

1234
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:40,821
whatever.

1235
00:32:40,821 --> 00:32:43,100
I don't feel like I just
annoyed the fuck out of me.

1236
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:43,950
They,

1237
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:44,930
it's so bad.

1238
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,500
It's,

1239
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,161
it's taking,

1240
00:32:46,161 --> 00:32:47,900
it's like if you ha if you were a painter,

1241
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,340
it's taking all your,

1242
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:49,790
uh,

1243
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:52,280
brushes away and replacing
them with crayons.

1244
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:52,970
Really.

1245
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,700
That's how bad it really isn't.

1246
00:32:54,701 --> 00:32:55,880
You just go back to the old one.

1247
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:56,671
Yeah.

1248
00:32:56,671 --> 00:32:57,504
But I think it's,

1249
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,100
I mean,

1250
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,500
they don't really upgrade
it or do anything.

1251
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:01,670
I don't think they were,

1252
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,200
I think they support it barely.

1253
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:03,710
You know,

1254
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:07,670
like I think I even have to uninstalling
my final cut pro that I have now.

1255
00:33:07,671 --> 00:33:09,830
Maybe before I could even put it on,

1256
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:12,710
I heard that premiere pro is really good,

1257
00:33:12,711 --> 00:33:14,270
but [inaudible] approach so much money.

1258
00:33:14,271 --> 00:33:14,750
I tried to,

1259
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,021
I was like,

1260
00:33:15,021 --> 00:33:16,330
how much is premiere pro buy it?

1261
00:33:16,331 --> 00:33:17,440
It was like $800 a month.

1262
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,071
Listen,

1263
00:33:18,071 --> 00:33:19,490
I'll buy it if you want to use,

1264
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,820
if you want to start making
videos again because you're,

1265
00:33:21,821 --> 00:33:22,870
you're really funny at it,

1266
00:33:22,871 --> 00:33:23,170
man.

1267
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,900
I mean like look the buffer three 60.

1268
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,250
If it wasn't for that video,

1269
00:33:27,251 --> 00:33:28,930
that dude would have never done that move.

1270
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:29,920
You know?

1271
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,161
I mean,

1272
00:33:30,161 --> 00:33:31,030
think about that.

1273
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,330
The MNC a video.

1274
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:32,690
Well,

1275
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:33,870
there's also the whole fact that,

1276
00:33:33,871 --> 00:33:35,300
that now that we do podcasting,

1277
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:38,000
it seems like there's nothing
that interesting anymore.

1278
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,950
Like when we hang out were both just like,

1279
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:40,670
uh,

1280
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:41,503
hello.

1281
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:42,991
You know what I do?

1282
00:33:42,991 --> 00:33:45,150
I couldn't barely muster
up the energy to do those,

1283
00:33:45,151 --> 00:33:45,480
uh,

1284
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,150
getting on stage videos
where like backstage like,

1285
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:48,571
Oh shit,

1286
00:33:48,571 --> 00:33:49,140
here we go.

1287
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:49,440
Right.

1288
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,273
But those are fun.

1289
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,420
I like doing those because also they're
fun for me to step back and look.

1290
00:33:54,421 --> 00:33:57,060
Cause sometimes I can't really believe
how big some of those crowds are.

1291
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:01,350
Like when you step back and
see the Chicago Theater or
Toronto and you look back

1292
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,630
and you see 3,400 fucking people,

1293
00:34:03,631 --> 00:34:03,870
you're like,

1294
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:04,770
Holy Shit,

1295
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,791
this Anaheim one,

1296
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:06,331
it's pretty big,

1297
00:34:06,331 --> 00:34:06,630
right?

1298
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:07,950
Is it a big theater?

1299
00:34:07,951 --> 00:34:09,960
1300 people or something like that.

1300
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:10,411
Yeah.

1301
00:34:10,411 --> 00:34:10,890
That's like,

1302
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:11,910
that's a decent size.

1303
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,013
But I'm like,

1304
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,130
Chicago is really big.

1305
00:34:14,131 --> 00:34:17,850
Chicago is 3000 plus that
Vegas place was 3000.

1306
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,313
There's a,

1307
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,160
there's like,

1308
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:20,993
you know,

1309
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:21,901
those,

1310
00:34:21,901 --> 00:34:24,930
those big crowds or that's a
totally different kind of energy.

1311
00:34:24,931 --> 00:34:28,740
That's a weird feeling when you get
onstage and there's just this giant rush.

1312
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,710
You've seen that Kevin Hart special,

1313
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,573
the um,

1314
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:32,980
the,

1315
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:35,190
the commercial for his upcoming special.

1316
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,510
Yeah,

1317
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,100
dude,

1318
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:42,100
he's on stage in front of like 18,000
people and the camera's behind him looking

1319
00:34:42,301 --> 00:34:44,600
at all these people like
screaming and cheering.

1320
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,061
You're like,

1321
00:34:45,061 --> 00:34:46,440
whoa.

1322
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,510
I think they had lighters up and shit too.

1323
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:48,850
Yeah.

1324
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:51,400
What's going on with the UFC video game?

1325
00:34:51,401 --> 00:34:52,234
I haven't.

1326
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,590
Is that even,

1327
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,990
is that dead now because
I know Thq is dead.

1328
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,910
They just totally 100% bankrupt.

1329
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,620
EA bought it.

1330
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,060
He bought it through the UFC video.

1331
00:35:01,061 --> 00:35:03,610
Now if you heard anything
or are you going to be I'm

1332
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:04,770
going through in her honor.

1333
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:05,850
Oh,

1334
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:06,390
I see.

1335
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,223
I don't really want to do it

1336
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,140
this other way for Dan showed up.

1337
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:11,060
Uh,

1338
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:11,330
I'll,

1339
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,060
I'll wind up doing it.

1340
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,580
I'm sure.

1341
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,413
Probably.

1342
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:13,951
Maybe not.

1343
00:35:13,951 --> 00:35:14,700
I don't want to.

1344
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,171
Yay.

1345
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:16,280
It's all fun dude.

1346
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:17,010
Doing those.

1347
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:20,400
I mean it'd be really cool pool boob
you go to full could sue the room and

1348
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:21,690
actually do some walk.

1349
00:35:21,691 --> 00:35:23,370
You fucking pussy the,

1350
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:23,731
but the,

1351
00:35:23,731 --> 00:35:25,020
the reality is it's not,

1352
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,950
it's not a good time.

1353
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,240
It's not like podcasting,

1354
00:35:27,241 --> 00:35:28,620
it's not like writing comedy.

1355
00:35:28,621 --> 00:35:32,490
It's not like doing all the things I enjoy
doing and it takes all lot of fucking

1356
00:35:32,491 --> 00:35:34,530
time that I don't have right now.

1357
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:34,920
And that's,

1358
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,291
that's the,

1359
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:37,360
the real problem with
everything with this,

1360
00:35:37,361 --> 00:35:40,150
a new show that I can't really mention
that I'm putting together right now.

1361
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,690
And then just writing comedy and
performing comedy and doing these,

1362
00:35:43,691 --> 00:35:46,690
I mean this is the fourth one of these
we did this week I didn't think were

1363
00:35:46,691 --> 00:35:47,231
going to do for,

1364
00:35:47,231 --> 00:35:50,800
I was trying to do three a week cause
I feel like three keeps me from getting

1365
00:35:50,801 --> 00:35:51,634
burnt out.

1366
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,070
Yeah.

1367
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,080
It's hard to talk.

1368
00:35:53,081 --> 00:35:54,160
Like on top of this,

1369
00:35:54,161 --> 00:35:56,220
I'm doing seven other ones and I'm,

1370
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:57,130
I'm like dead.

1371
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:57,461
Yeah.

1372
00:35:57,461 --> 00:35:59,620
Well that's your issue that inside you,

1373
00:35:59,621 --> 00:35:59,921
you,

1374
00:35:59,921 --> 00:36:01,210
you'd do it a little too much,

1375
00:36:01,211 --> 00:36:02,290
but you know,

1376
00:36:02,291 --> 00:36:04,300
it's your choice and it's also,

1377
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:04,751
you know,

1378
00:36:04,751 --> 00:36:07,120
a side business sort of
thing you've got going on.

1379
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:07,810
If I don't do it,

1380
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:10,680
I probably would be
murdered at this point.

1381
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,043
And also

1382
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,600
we were talking about where,

1383
00:36:13,601 --> 00:36:13,961
you know,

1384
00:36:13,961 --> 00:36:14,381
we,

1385
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:14,830
uh,

1386
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:15,820
we have,

1387
00:36:15,821 --> 00:36:16,480
uh,

1388
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,190
an interesting situation now with all
of these comedians that were sort of a

1389
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,460
network together with,

1390
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,271
and,

1391
00:36:22,271 --> 00:36:22,510
uh,

1392
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,470
I think we,

1393
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:24,270
we've found,

1394
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,060
uh,

1395
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:28,060
some unique ideas as to
how to like help everybody.

1396
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:31,960
It's a matter of checking for
the light control stuck on green.

1397
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:32,711
We're,

1398
00:36:32,711 --> 00:36:33,130
uh,

1399
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:35,290
we have some unique opportunities to like,

1400
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:35,920
uh,

1401
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,690
do specials with people and Shit.

1402
00:36:37,691 --> 00:36:41,110
Like I liked how are he's doing his
special now and he's doing it online.

1403
00:36:41,111 --> 00:36:44,380
I would like to do one with Joey
and we'd like to do one with,

1404
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,050
with you and I think we should
probably start doing those.

1405
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,210
We were talking about
this before the podcast,

1406
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,800
like doing them out of the ice house,

1407
00:36:50,801 --> 00:36:53,590
like doing special at the ice
house would be fucking awesome.

1408
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:56,530
They already have like
one camera that's on you.

1409
00:36:56,531 --> 00:36:58,000
Like they film like they'll,

1410
00:36:58,001 --> 00:36:59,560
they'll give you a DVD of the set anyway.

1411
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,500
Then then we just need like side angles,

1412
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:02,920
you know,

1413
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,480
set up cameras on the sides of the room.

1414
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,270
Fillmont hire someone to slap it together.

1415
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,600
We could and you get the
real club experience with,

1416
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,280
as we were saying before,

1417
00:37:12,281 --> 00:37:13,900
the podcast started quite frankly,

1418
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:15,580
is better than the theater experience.

1419
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,380
The theater experiences bigger.

1420
00:37:17,381 --> 00:37:18,101
It's crazier.

1421
00:37:18,101 --> 00:37:19,060
It's like wow.

1422
00:37:19,061 --> 00:37:19,661
It was like wow,

1423
00:37:19,661 --> 00:37:20,494
look at all these people.

1424
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:21,320
But

1425
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,280
it's also really,

1426
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:27,340
really important to actually be able
to feel the vibe of the audience very

1427
00:37:28,251 --> 00:37:29,084
accurately.

1428
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:34,010
And when you're in a theater you kind
of get like you see the front row or two

1429
00:37:34,011 --> 00:37:37,430
and he's just that the noise and the
feeling of the room kind of just goes

1430
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,650
upwards or something where
we're near a comedy club.

1431
00:37:39,651 --> 00:37:41,480
You can feel up this girl to the right of,

1432
00:37:41,481 --> 00:37:45,770
he was kind of irritated or you can feel
that if you're killing it on this side,

1433
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:46,551
if theater,

1434
00:37:46,551 --> 00:37:47,720
it's really hard to judge that.

1435
00:37:47,721 --> 00:37:51,080
And judging timing is completely
different than timing in a cause.

1436
00:37:51,081 --> 00:37:53,000
You're laughs have to
kind of carry farther.

1437
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:53,841
So your timing.

1438
00:37:53,841 --> 00:37:56,070
So timing is a little
different than the sound

1439
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,590
carries different and the,

1440
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,430
the ceiling is like way higher.

1441
00:37:59,431 --> 00:38:00,031
Like when you're,

1442
00:38:00,031 --> 00:38:01,140
you're dealing with a theater,

1443
00:38:01,141 --> 00:38:02,430
you're dealing with two floors.

1444
00:38:02,431 --> 00:38:02,671
Okay.

1445
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:05,740
There's a balcony and some places
like think Chicago at three floors.

1446
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:05,970
Yeah.

1447
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,290
So you're dealing with three,

1448
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:11,190
a three story indoor building
and this gigantic cavernous room.

1449
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,100
It's just a completely
different experience to,

1450
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,220
it's like the ice house.

1451
00:38:14,221 --> 00:38:16,980
It's like you could jump up and
touch the ceiling at any place.

1452
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,750
Let's say Dennis.

1453
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:18,391
Hey look,

1454
00:38:18,391 --> 00:38:19,230
they showed up.

1455
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:20,040
All right.

1456
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,400
Dana white just pulled in
with a big smile on his face.

1457
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,100
All full of toxic gases

1458
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,253
were alive.

1459
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:33,981
We are,

1460
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:34,500
uh,

1461
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,333
Dennis here.

1462
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,100
He's our

1463
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,341
hand.

1464
00:38:36,341 --> 00:38:37,070
Shakings.

1465
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:37,580
Yeah.

1466
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,413
What's up buddy?

1467
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,680
Don't worry about it man.

1468
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:48,000
We've been talking shit
about all kinds of things.

1469
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:50,883
Yeah.

1470
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,910
There is no reason to live in Los
Angeles and make that commute every day.

1471
00:38:57,911 --> 00:38:59,530
If you have to do that commute every day,

1472
00:38:59,531 --> 00:39:00,670
you need to fucking move.

1473
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,660
I'd kill myself.

1474
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,740
There's a lot of people that do it.

1475
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,760
I'd kill myself.

1476
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,890
I'd rather fucking die to that everyday.

1477
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,001
I'm not kidding you,

1478
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:07,570
man.

1479
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:08,440
That was brutal.

1480
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,161
It's unbelievable.

1481
00:39:09,161 --> 00:39:10,570
And it gets worse and worse every year.

1482
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,120
I moved here in 94 and it was bad then,

1483
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:13,931
but it's now,

1484
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:14,764
it's insanity.

1485
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,440
Never Bitch about Las
Vegas traffic ever again.

1486
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:18,190
You know,

1487
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,840
I don't ever experienced
that when I come here,

1488
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:22,040
cause I know exactly where I got it going.

1489
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:22,923
I don't ever,

1490
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:23,410
oh,

1491
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,790
this is why it's madness.

1492
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,541
It's madness.

1493
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:26,650
I left two hours ago.

1494
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,180
Oh that's you got lucky.

1495
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:28,990
You got lucky.

1496
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,070
Mean seven o'clock.

1497
00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:30,281
You should,

1498
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:31,750
if you left an hour before that,

1499
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:32,501
you would have been even more.

1500
00:39:32,501 --> 00:39:32,810
Fuck,

1501
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:33,760
this place is cool.

1502
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,470
When did you like the Werewolf?

1503
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:36,943
It's trippy.

1504
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,170
Where'd you get that?

1505
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,450
I just had it made a,

1506
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,750
this guy pat McGee,

1507
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:41,380
this a,

1508
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,450
he does a special effort
to make a wearable.

1509
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,050
It's American Werewolf in
London and this is the alien,

1510
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:47,884
right?

1511
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,600
You gotta get the alien and Predator.

1512
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:49,960
Yeah,

1513
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,880
he's going to make me an a,

1514
00:39:50,881 --> 00:39:51,620
an alien to me.

1515
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,453
Does that as well?

1516
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:53,590
Yeah.

1517
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,710
Pat Mcgee is this guy.

1518
00:39:54,711 --> 00:39:56,020
So special effects dude.

1519
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,580
And that he's one of the things he does,

1520
00:39:57,581 --> 00:39:57,911
he makes,

1521
00:39:57,911 --> 00:39:58,720
he's uh,

1522
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,950
he's made like 70 of these.

1523
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,610
Okay.

1524
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,220
70 people out there with
these fucking things.

1525
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:02,830
It's crazy.

1526
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,060
Giant American Werewolf.

1527
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,171
I'm a grown up child,

1528
00:40:05,171 --> 00:40:05,390
Dana.

1529
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,223
I know.

1530
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,470
What I love about what
I love about you too.

1531
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:12,600
Dana and I have known each
other for what do we mean?

1532
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,300
Like 2001 or something like that.

1533
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,200
I came down to watch the UFC
and we started talking shit.

1534
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:22,620
And that was back when you guys had
just taken over the company and you were

1535
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:26,710
just sort of trying to figure out what
the fuck was going on with this thing.

1536
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,540
It's so funny to see.

1537
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:33,690
It's like very rare in life that you get
a chance to see like some people buy a

1538
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:37,810
sport like literally by the whole sport.

1539
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:39,850
I mean there was nothing
going on Ms Pride in Japan,

1540
00:40:39,851 --> 00:40:40,920
but I in America there's not.

1541
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:45,930
You bought the sport and then it became
gigantic all over the course of like a

1542
00:40:46,691 --> 00:40:47,411
decade or so.

1543
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:49,750
Like when has that ever happened?

1544
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,720
Not with skateboarding
that with motorcross,

1545
00:40:52,721 --> 00:40:53,610
not with soccer,

1546
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,040
not with,

1547
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,780
they tried with a million
different fucking things.

1548
00:40:55,990 --> 00:41:00,130
Nothing has ever gone from
being like a spectacle.

1549
00:41:00,131 --> 00:41:01,990
Like the first event I worked was Dothan,

1550
00:41:01,991 --> 00:41:02,501
Alabama,

1551
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:06,580
UFC 12 1997 that was with seg.

1552
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:09,670
We were in a fucking like
auditorium somewhere.

1553
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:14,140
It was like maybe a thousand people
scattered in a 2000 seat place.

1554
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:14,950
Right.

1555
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:15,850
And it was,

1556
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,740
it was a little tiny fucking airport.

1557
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,420
You fly in and a propeller plane.

1558
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,600
It was ridiculous.

1559
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,010
Right to go from when,

1560
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:22,450
when,

1561
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,110
when people,

1562
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:23,471
you know,

1563
00:41:23,471 --> 00:41:24,850
when people talk to me and they say,

1564
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,301
you know what,

1565
00:41:25,301 --> 00:41:26,350
I see shit on the Internet,

1566
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:27,910
or I read stuff on Twitter and like,

1567
00:41:27,911 --> 00:41:28,031
yeah,

1568
00:41:28,031 --> 00:41:29,680
these fucking guys are
in it for the money.

1569
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,930
It's all about the money
and the this and that.

1570
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:32,973
We'd tell you what,

1571
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,130
when we've

1572
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:39,130
fucking bought this thing in 2001
the Fertittas own station casinos,

1573
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:43,130
the fourth largest gaming
company in the country,

1574
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,990
they own Gordon Beers brewing company.

1575
00:41:44,991 --> 00:41:45,824
They sold it.

1576
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,570
They've owned fuck real estate aim,

1577
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:48,141
you name it.

1578
00:41:48,141 --> 00:41:49,970
These guys have had their
hands in everything they've,

1579
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:53,690
they've bought and sold just about
everything and major stocks and all these

1580
00:41:53,691 --> 00:41:54,524
deals and shit.

1581
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,380
When I talked him into
buying this company,

1582
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,610
dude,

1583
00:41:58,610 --> 00:41:59,780
the guys that work for them,

1584
00:41:59,781 --> 00:42:00,020
you know,

1585
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:00,720
there's,

1586
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,380
there's an army of guys that work for
them to do all the finance and shit.

1587
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:07,090
Thought this was the dumbest fucking
idea and the history of the world.

1588
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,730
I remember they hated,

1589
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,530
hated me,

1590
00:42:10,531 --> 00:42:11,970
hated the fucking UFC.

1591
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,940
We're the redheaded stepchild
of the Fertitta portfolio.

1592
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:15,420
You know,

1593
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,070
I remember when the Vladimir,

1594
00:42:17,071 --> 00:42:17,251
Matt,

1595
00:42:17,251 --> 00:42:21,240
you Shanko Tito Ortiz fight went over
and I wasn't working for you guys back

1596
00:42:21,241 --> 00:42:21,570
then.

1597
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:22,201
I was a,

1598
00:42:22,201 --> 00:42:25,320
I was a spectator and it was right
after September 11th and it was fucking

1599
00:42:25,321 --> 00:42:26,131
really dramatic.

1600
00:42:26,131 --> 00:42:26,580
I mean,

1601
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:30,270
Tito was standing there and he had the
American flag in his hand and people went

1602
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,590
fucking crazy

1603
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,083
room.

1604
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,510
If you remember at that
time when that happened,

1605
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:39,320
it was two weeks after
September 11 and we uh,

1606
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,300
we actually sold out Mandalay bay.

1607
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:41,930
Um,

1608
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:43,010
it was already sold out,

1609
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:45,410
but we didn't know if anybody's
going to fucking show up,

1610
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:46,603
you know what I mean?

1611
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,601
Because number 11,

1612
00:42:47,601 --> 00:42:48,880
nobody was flying plates.

1613
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,271
I'm not kidding you.

1614
00:42:50,271 --> 00:42:51,680
Las Vegas was a ghost town.

1615
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:55,600
You could fucking run
through a casino naked.

1616
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,480
Nobody would see you.

1617
00:42:56,690 --> 00:43:01,690
It was dead and a real weird
eerie time fucking everybody got,

1618
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,830
everybody came to Las
Vegas for that event,

1619
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:03,981
man.

1620
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:08,070
It was like the first big event back in
Vegas after all the shit happened for

1621
00:43:08,071 --> 00:43:08,581
that event.

1622
00:43:08,581 --> 00:43:12,180
I wasn't working for you
guys and Camry quite suck.

1623
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,630
Every fight suck.

1624
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:17,400
And then we went over on
the fucking paper view.

1625
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,301
Yeah,

1626
00:43:18,301 --> 00:43:19,710
you guys didn't have it down yet.

1627
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,660
I'm a pretty upbeat person.

1628
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,910
I'm don't get depressed
and I'll get fucked.

1629
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,520
I seriously was thinking
about fucking killing myself.

1630
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:26,680
Then

1631
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,960
I went and I hung out with
you guys after it was over.

1632
00:43:28,961 --> 00:43:32,230
It was you and Lorenzo and you just both
the after party was like the shittiest

1633
00:43:32,231 --> 00:43:33,190
after party ever.

1634
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,001
You were like,

1635
00:43:34,001 --> 00:43:35,470
we have to give everybody
their money back.

1636
00:43:35,471 --> 00:43:37,500
Like whoa.

1637
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:39,880
So you guys,

1638
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:43,200
it got to this point where
you're thinking about selling.

1639
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,110
That's why people don't want
to hear something funny.

1640
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,600
People always ask me
why I don't do the uh,

1641
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:48,651
the fucking,

1642
00:43:48,651 --> 00:43:49,191
what's it called?

1643
00:43:49,191 --> 00:43:50,480
The Star spangled banner,

1644
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:50,890
you know?

1645
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:51,723
Yeah.

1646
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,230
What is that one is?

1647
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:53,710
Yeah.

1648
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:53,981
Why?

1649
00:43:53,981 --> 00:43:54,940
Why I don't do that.

1650
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:56,380
We did it that night.

1651
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,890
We did it that night and I
completely fucking blame that.

1652
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,160
That was why it happened.

1653
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:06,790
You had to Dover

1654
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:07,980
just September 11.

1655
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:08,310
Right?

1656
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:10,740
There was like a crazy
energy in the air that night.

1657
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:11,611
It was a,

1658
00:44:11,611 --> 00:44:15,420
it was really intense when Tito made
this like big dramatic entrance.

1659
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,540
That was back when you guys still have
the ramp and Tito's at the top of the

1660
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:18,961
ramp.

1661
00:44:18,961 --> 00:44:20,550
And I don't know if there's pyrotechnics.

1662
00:44:20,551 --> 00:44:22,520
I don't remember the fucking man.

1663
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,250
Hello half the building up back then.

1664
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:25,930
You didn't have like a half the place.

1665
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:27,970
I was so happy when you
guys stopped doing that.

1666
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:30,340
Tito on fire and fucking uh,

1667
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:31,970
and the metal literally

1668
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:32,821
caught on fire.

1669
00:44:32,821 --> 00:44:34,380
Guys have gotten lit on fire,

1670
00:44:34,381 --> 00:44:34,591
man.

1671
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:35,550
You know why we did that?

1672
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:36,350
Nobody.

1673
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:37,183
That's why we did that.

1674
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:39,120
Why we did that big stage.

1675
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,100
Why ramp and all the pyrotechnics.

1676
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:41,610
Why?

1677
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:43,200
Because we didn't sell that
many tickets back then.

1678
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:46,290
Oh see eight up super cut off the ramp,

1679
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:48,900
cut off a quarter of the building
and make it look like the place.

1680
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,060
Then we'll go and pride
did it like as a pageant.

1681
00:44:52,061 --> 00:44:54,130
She thing pride had
some amazing entrances,

1682
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:56,580
but they lit Joelle
deal all of air on fire,

1683
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,370
you know,

1684
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:58,310
and then to bring them down.

1685
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,153
If I'm not joking,

1686
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:00,550
I believe it was like you don't fight.

1687
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:01,443
I believe it.

1688
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:02,730
It's,

1689
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:04,080
that's a dangerous thing.

1690
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:06,780
Fucking pyrotechnics and shit and yeah,

1691
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:07,830
it's not necessary.

1692
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:08,870
I don't like mixing place.

1693
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,930
Look full back then though.

1694
00:45:09,931 --> 00:45:13,260
You had to take up a quarter of the arena
and then you got less tickets to sell.

1695
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:16,580
My favorite walk in is Frankie Edgar
cause when they let that motherfucker

1696
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:17,450
Biggie don't,

1697
00:45:17,451 --> 00:45:18,150
don't,

1698
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,290
he just starts running.

1699
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,131
He just runs.

1700
00:45:20,131 --> 00:45:22,920
Let me tell you how much better I
like guys coming out of tunnels.

1701
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,013
You know,

1702
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,610
we did what we had to do in the
beginning with this thing and,

1703
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:30,870
and there was a lot of smoke and mirrors
and stuff that you have to do to,

1704
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:33,360
to make something like this
happening and to grow it.

1705
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:34,350
Um,

1706
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:35,310
but for me,

1707
00:45:35,311 --> 00:45:38,670
I'm a hardcore traditional fucking toe.

1708
00:45:38,671 --> 00:45:39,900
The bone fight fan.

1709
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:43,680
I want to see a dude coming out of the
bowels of the fucking arena through a

1710
00:45:43,681 --> 00:45:47,070
tunnel and through a crowd of arms and
hands sticking out and people going

1711
00:45:47,071 --> 00:45:47,640
crazy.

1712
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,660
I love that shit.

1713
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:48,930
Yeah,

1714
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:49,350
me too.

1715
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:51,240
Nick the to sit down
and you fucking nervous.

1716
00:45:51,241 --> 00:45:51,541
Prick.

1717
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:52,374
What are you doing?

1718
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,810
You're wandering around back there.

1719
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:56,370
Hold it under your date and
meet the whole couch here fella.

1720
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:58,950
You've been sucking in gas
fumes for an hour and a half.

1721
00:45:58,980 --> 00:45:59,360
Oh No.

1722
00:45:59,360 --> 00:45:59,820
Pocket.

1723
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:02,820
He's been sleeping for fucking
11 hours so you can easily,

1724
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:03,181
he's now,

1725
00:46:03,181 --> 00:46:06,000
he's all wired and ready to
fucking roll if you've never seen.

1726
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:08,940
Dana has he's world famous
video blogs where there's no,

1727
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:11,160
no president of any company
that lets people in.

1728
00:46:11,161 --> 00:46:12,310
And as much as you let people,

1729
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:16,650
you do these video blogs
where occasionally some
ridiculous things take place.

1730
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,030
And one of them was a,

1731
00:46:18,031 --> 00:46:20,690
our good pal Joe Lozan and nick the tooth,

1732
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:22,170
a grappling competition.

1733
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:25,830
He gave Joe Lowe's on $1,000 for every
submission that he could pull off in five

1734
00:46:25,831 --> 00:46:26,191
minutes,

1735
00:46:26,191 --> 00:46:27,024
bad move.

1736
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:29,940
And he put a six and six
submission beaten down,

1737
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:31,711
you know.

1738
00:46:31,711 --> 00:46:31,871
And,

1739
00:46:31,871 --> 00:46:33,210
and nick was like,

1740
00:46:33,211 --> 00:46:33,271
Hey,

1741
00:46:33,271 --> 00:46:33,860
I believe tap.

1742
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:36,420
I mean he's a fucking
professional fighter.

1743
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:36,871
Like,

1744
00:46:36,871 --> 00:46:38,250
what are you talking about?

1745
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:41,610
The people are so ridiculous when it
comes to like professional fighters.

1746
00:46:41,611 --> 00:46:43,180
Do you know how many people ask me?

1747
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:44,143
They're like,

1748
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:45,420
you get these,

1749
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,890
these fucking guys who think,

1750
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:47,724
you know,

1751
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:53,280
really don't get and appreciate how good
these fighters really are and what to

1752
00:46:53,281 --> 00:46:54,810
be a mixed martial artist really means.

1753
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:57,510
And now I've got these guys
saying they fucking crazy.

1754
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,690
You were actually think that Ronda
Rousey could fucking do something.

1755
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,310
Oh my fucking God.

1756
00:47:02,311 --> 00:47:02,910
Do you know him?

1757
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:07,140
Do you know what she did to
that boxer that I saw it.

1758
00:47:07,141 --> 00:47:09,270
I watched them silly bitch.

1759
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,530
Next is a beast.

1760
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,180
She's 150 pound beast.

1761
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:12,780
Okay,

1762
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:13,280
she cut.

1763
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,450
Wait to make one 3,550.

1764
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:20,780
Did you see the sign woman of that
reporter guy supposed to be reviewed some

1765
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:22,260
fucking dude with a camcorder.

1766
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,330
He showed up with a g and was,

1767
00:47:24,331 --> 00:47:24,920
uh,

1768
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,530
an asked,

1769
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:25,770
you know,

1770
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:26,603
he said,

1771
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:28,930
this is a couple of days
ago before fight and she's,

1772
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:29,391
he says,

1773
00:47:29,391 --> 00:47:29,601
well,

1774
00:47:29,601 --> 00:47:29,811
you know,

1775
00:47:29,811 --> 00:47:32,120
I don't think girls really
are that tough and this,

1776
00:47:32,121 --> 00:47:32,750
that and everything else.

1777
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,700
What would it take to get you to throw me?

1778
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:35,773
She goes,

1779
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,190
you said the right things already,

1780
00:47:37,191 --> 00:47:37,461
buddy.

1781
00:47:37,461 --> 00:47:38,240
Let's do this.

1782
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,890
She grabbed him by his fucking gay,

1783
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:41,323
and I'm telling you,

1784
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:43,460
the judo shit scares me man.

1785
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,780
When when they take your feet,

1786
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,540
go up in the air over and she could tell
she was using her fucking weight and

1787
00:47:50,541 --> 00:47:51,920
she came down on that dude hard.

1788
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,330
She fucked him up.

1789
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:56,920
I'm sure man.

1790
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:57,491
Yeah,

1791
00:47:57,491 --> 00:47:59,800
you don't want to lock
horns with an Olympian,

1792
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:00,221
you know?

1793
00:48:00,221 --> 00:48:01,860
And it's the idea that's so stupid.

1794
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:04,570
I've heard people say silly
shit about her like that.

1795
00:48:04,571 --> 00:48:04,980
She's,

1796
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:05,170
Oh,

1797
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:05,891
she's a woman.

1798
00:48:05,891 --> 00:48:06,581
I wouldn't be scaled.

1799
00:48:06,581 --> 00:48:10,040
She'll break your fucking
arm nice and your neck.

1800
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:11,620
You don't know how,

1801
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:16,060
like when you see like how quick
her hips move when she hits armbars,

1802
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:19,240
that's some really high level shit.

1803
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:20,800
When she whips those hips over,

1804
00:48:20,801 --> 00:48:25,000
like the amount of time you
have to recognize what she's
doing and the amount of

1805
00:48:25,001 --> 00:48:30,001
control she has and the ability to adjust
while you're realizing she's doing,

1806
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:31,300
she knows what you're going to do.

1807
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,250
She's done that a million
fucking times row.

1808
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,010
So she knows that she's
throwing those things up.

1809
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:36,160
You're going to try to pull out.

1810
00:48:36,161 --> 00:48:39,610
So she's going to scoot forward and she's
gonna catch you and belly down on you

1811
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:41,470
and snap your shit son.

1812
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:42,910
And she's got a fucking neck,

1813
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:44,503
right?

1814
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:48,700
And she's got fuck and she had beautiful
shoulder and she's still beautiful.

1815
00:48:48,701 --> 00:48:50,050
She's still a woman,

1816
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,630
but she's about as like fit and strong.

1817
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:52,781
Oh,

1818
00:48:52,781 --> 00:48:54,140
it's Aaron True Guy Right here.

1819
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:55,180
Aaron is so silly.

1820
00:48:55,181 --> 00:48:56,140
He does this everywhere.

1821
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:56,974
I told the guy,

1822
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:57,231
yeah,

1823
00:48:57,231 --> 00:48:57,370
yeah,

1824
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:57,790
yeah.

1825
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:00,940
I told them to stop doing this because
he's letting guys beat him up like,

1826
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,670
like Jason Ellis beat the shit out of him,

1827
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,280
man.

1828
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,820
He beat the Shit Outta him.

1829
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,310
He might fucking change
his mind after this.

1830
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:08,581
Oh,

1831
00:49:08,581 --> 00:49:10,020
she did it on a hardwood.

1832
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,020
Oh my God.

1833
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:11,641
That's nothing,

1834
00:49:11,641 --> 00:49:11,821
Bro.

1835
00:49:11,821 --> 00:49:12,840
Wait till she throws him.

1836
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:13,861
Oh No,

1837
00:49:13,861 --> 00:49:14,694
she does.

1838
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,740
Oh my God.

1839
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:18,120
Oh my God,

1840
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:19,890
this she does.

1841
00:49:19,891 --> 00:49:22,080
It's so easy to freeze up.

1842
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:25,050
Watch when she lands on boom.

1843
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:25,850
Oh.

1844
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:29,820
[inaudible] ribs all on this side.

1845
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:30,181
Oh,

1846
00:49:30,181 --> 00:49:31,410
Jesus Christ.

1847
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:32,161
Yeah.

1848
00:49:32,161 --> 00:49:33,840
Erin has a Cyborg.

1849
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:35,040
Beat the shit out of him.

1850
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,440
He's had a lot of people
beat the shit out of him.

1851
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:40,561
Look at his face,

1852
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:40,830
man.

1853
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:41,670
That's not fun.

1854
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:42,301
Yeah,

1855
00:49:42,301 --> 00:49:43,410
that's so stupid.

1856
00:49:43,411 --> 00:49:43,760
But he,

1857
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,000
he always does this.

1858
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:46,110
He actually asked for it.

1859
00:49:46,111 --> 00:49:48,050
He's doing like a jackass sort of a thing.

1860
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:50,290
That's a good way to get that
guy in about eight years.

1861
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:51,124
See how he's feeling.

1862
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,430
Especially he's not even doing a mat.

1863
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,780
He's doing it on like a dance floor.

1864
00:49:54,781 --> 00:49:55,770
I was doing it for nothing.

1865
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,100
I like you're fucking fighting and
trying to be the best and getting paid.

1866
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,890
He's not doing it for nothing
because we're talking about him.

1867
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,710
Yeah.

1868
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:02,640
That's what he's trying to do.

1869
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:03,040
Yeah.

1870
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,620
It's going in a jackass style.

1871
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:05,520
Listen,

1872
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,353
what's his name?

1873
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:06,631
Aaron.

1874
00:50:06,631 --> 00:50:06,900
True.

1875
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:07,733
Erin true.

1876
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:11,310
I hope you make a million fucking
dollars off off this podcast.

1877
00:50:11,311 --> 00:50:11,940
Okay,

1878
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:12,270
good.

1879
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:13,200
I hope so buddy.

1880
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,850
You're out of your fucking mind.

1881
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:15,511
Yeah.

1882
00:50:15,511 --> 00:50:16,560
I wouldn't let that happen.

1883
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:18,270
He lets a lot of people beat him up.

1884
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:18,961
He lets,

1885
00:50:18,961 --> 00:50:19,230
uh,

1886
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:19,771
like I said,

1887
00:50:19,771 --> 00:50:20,604
he led a,

1888
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:21,900
if you watch the Jason Ellis one,

1889
00:50:21,901 --> 00:50:22,561
that's the worst one.

1890
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,910
LSP thought shit out of him.

1891
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:27,050
He liked sparred with Jason and
Jason just started wailing on

1892
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,140
full blast power shots to the head.

1893
00:50:30,141 --> 00:50:30,441
He was like,

1894
00:50:30,441 --> 00:50:30,621
yeah,

1895
00:50:30,621 --> 00:50:32,150
it wasn't right after that
for a couple of weeks.

1896
00:50:32,151 --> 00:50:32,660
I'm like,

1897
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,140
yeah,

1898
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:33,610
no kidding.

1899
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:34,361
That's a good cushion.

1900
00:50:34,361 --> 00:50:35,220
It's called brain damage.

1901
00:50:35,221 --> 00:50:35,630
Dude.

1902
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:36,980
What the fuck are you doing with yourself?

1903
00:50:36,981 --> 00:50:37,814
Are you out of your mind?

1904
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,020
Speaking of brain damage,

1905
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:41,690
did you know that your money's disease,

1906
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:41,991
that,

1907
00:50:41,991 --> 00:50:42,290
uh,

1908
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:44,270
that cannabis is like
one of the best cures?

1909
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:45,143
Because I shot,

1910
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:46,550
I did not know that.

1911
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:48,170
He's not for you.

1912
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,930
It's actually been doing a
lot of research for me on,

1913
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:51,773
on the money's thing.

1914
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,300
They actually found some shit,

1915
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:54,000
you know,

1916
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,110
I'm seeing all these doctors and stuff
and nick will tell folks who don't know

1917
00:50:57,111 --> 00:50:57,861
what we're talking about.

1918
00:50:57,861 --> 00:50:59,640
You've had this issue for me.

1919
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:00,380
How many years now?

1920
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,630
So what happened was
when I was 21 years old,

1921
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:02,940
uh,

1922
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,160
I lived in Boston and I,

1923
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:06,380
I got jumped one night at this,

1924
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:07,243
at this bar,

1925
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:12,320
and these dudes beat the living shit
out of me for about a good 20 minutes,

1926
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,250
20 minutes,

1927
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,780
literally until the police came.

1928
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:15,561
And,

1929
00:51:15,561 --> 00:51:15,720
uh,

1930
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,990
at one point I remember I was on one knee,

1931
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:22,790
it's fucking guy must have punched
me in this ear a thousand times,

1932
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:23,750
you know,

1933
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:23,970
you know,

1934
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:26,570
and I was getting kicked and hit from
all kinds of different directions.

1935
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:26,910
They're,

1936
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:27,910
the guys were from Charlestown.

1937
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,970
I'm lucky I didn't get stabbed.

1938
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,530
I'm lucky I got the shit beat out of me.

1939
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,830
So after that happened,

1940
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:36,140
my ear rang for months,

1941
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,990
I mean fucking loud to where I
couldn't sleep and stuff like that.

1942
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:40,550
So I went to the doctor and they said,

1943
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:44,990
you have permanent hearing loss and
damage to that year and everything else.

1944
00:51:44,991 --> 00:51:45,824
So no big deal,

1945
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:46,251
you know,

1946
00:51:46,251 --> 00:51:47,120
it was what it was.

1947
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:47,901
And I,

1948
00:51:47,901 --> 00:51:48,680
uh,

1949
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:48,951
you know,

1950
00:51:48,951 --> 00:51:49,711
later on in life it,

1951
00:51:49,711 --> 00:51:51,560
and it eventually turned into minis,

1952
00:51:51,561 --> 00:51:52,790
which is nerve damage.

1953
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:56,120
And the brain is telling the nervous,

1954
00:51:56,121 --> 00:51:59,090
telling the brain we're
moving when we're really not.

1955
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:00,710
And it causes,

1956
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:02,180
when I say spin man,

1957
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:04,220
the room starts spinning so fast.

1958
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,480
You have to grab on to shit.

1959
00:52:05,481 --> 00:52:06,291
You closed your eyes,

1960
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:09,530
you go in the dark and just close
your eyes sometimes for hours.

1961
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:09,951
You know,

1962
00:52:09,951 --> 00:52:10,850
when this thing hits me,

1963
00:52:10,851 --> 00:52:12,920
I'm down for sometimes
eight or nine hours.

1964
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:14,683
And uh,

1965
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:17,390
so there's no cure for it,

1966
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:22,340
but they have these real controversial
surgeries that you can go in and do.

1967
00:52:22,341 --> 00:52:22,971
And you know,

1968
00:52:22,971 --> 00:52:24,020
I'm a fucking lunatic.

1969
00:52:24,021 --> 00:52:24,854
So I'm like,

1970
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:25,790
I don't give a shit.

1971
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,930
I'm getting the surgery,

1972
00:52:26,931 --> 00:52:27,081
Dah,

1973
00:52:27,081 --> 00:52:27,171
Dah,

1974
00:52:27,171 --> 00:52:27,291
Dah.

1975
00:52:27,291 --> 00:52:29,060
And the doctor was kind of
hemming and hawing on it.

1976
00:52:29,061 --> 00:52:29,301
I said,

1977
00:52:29,301 --> 00:52:30,134
just do it doc.

1978
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:30,650
Well,

1979
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:31,670
I just went in yesterday.

1980
00:52:31,671 --> 00:52:31,881
You didn't,

1981
00:52:31,881 --> 00:52:33,470
you didn't know this cause we
didn't talk about this yet.

1982
00:52:33,471 --> 00:52:38,000
So this was my first followup and the
fucking surgery was a complete disaster.

1983
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,680
So that's why I've been
so fucked up lately.

1984
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:40,833
Disastrous.

1985
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:42,103
Um,

1986
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:42,321
it,

1987
00:52:42,321 --> 00:52:43,154
uh,

1988
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,400
it helped 70% of the people,

1989
00:52:45,401 --> 00:52:46,160
it helps,

1990
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:46,371
um,

1991
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:48,290
the 30% that went the other way.

1992
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:51,080
So now I have almost completely
lost the hearing in this ear.

1993
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:55,100
My hearing is almost completely gone
and I've been having attacks every day.

1994
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:57,110
The last two days I haven't had an attack.

1995
00:52:57,111 --> 00:52:58,100
So it's been pretty cool.

1996
00:52:58,490 --> 00:52:58,860
And,

1997
00:52:58,860 --> 00:52:59,693
uh,

1998
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:00,950
I'm feeling pretty good.

1999
00:53:00,951 --> 00:53:01,784
But like I said,

2000
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:02,331
so that's,

2001
00:53:02,331 --> 00:53:02,691
that's the,

2002
00:53:02,691 --> 00:53:03,524
in a nutshell,

2003
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:06,680
there's nothing you can do about it unless
now I optical in and get the surgery

2004
00:53:06,681 --> 00:53:07,610
where they cut the nerve,

2005
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:10,880
which will put me in the hospital for
seven days and then I'll have to learn how

2006
00:53:10,881 --> 00:53:11,714
to walk again.

2007
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:14,690
So for how long,

2008
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,620
how long does it take to learn
how to walk in and left the reds?

2009
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:19,700
Lorenzo said his dad learned
to walk again in a month.

2010
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:22,850
So in his dad was in his
sixties when he did it.

2011
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:23,900
He had the same operation.

2012
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:24,380
Yeah.

2013
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:24,970
Whoa.

2014
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:25,803
So

2015
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:26,490
I,

2016
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:26,751
I don't know,

2017
00:53:26,751 --> 00:53:27,220
a month.

2018
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:29,050
A month of not knowing how to walk.

2019
00:53:29,051 --> 00:53:29,680
Yeah.

2020
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,670
And then that perception,

2021
00:53:30,671 --> 00:53:31,960
like picking things up like this.

2022
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:32,680
Whoa.

2023
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:33,280
Yeah.

2024
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:33,461
Yeah.

2025
00:53:33,461 --> 00:53:36,490
People don't realize how much the
ear is related to equilibrium.

2026
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:39,790
It's why when guys get punched
sometimes you see in a fight or kicked.

2027
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:40,090
Yeah,

2028
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:40,270
they,

2029
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:40,560
they,

2030
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,200
they get,

2031
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:41,681
yeah,

2032
00:53:41,681 --> 00:53:43,360
they equilibrium blows and it's an,

2033
00:53:43,361 --> 00:53:46,960
it's an ear injury and inner ear injury
and sometimes eardrums get popped.

2034
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:48,880
They get blown out from punches.

2035
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:50,921
Especially,

2036
00:53:50,921 --> 00:53:51,754
you see that a lot.

2037
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:52,661
In the old days,

2038
00:53:52,661 --> 00:53:56,260
guys would slap guys in the ears a
lot when they'd have them on the side,

2039
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:57,670
they would slap them,

2040
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:57,941
you know,

2041
00:53:57,941 --> 00:53:59,000
instead of punching them and you know,

2042
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:00,220
it hurts like hell fuck.

2043
00:54:00,221 --> 00:54:00,460
Yeah.

2044
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:04,300
Does a lot of guys have broken their
hands ground and pounded on dudes?

2045
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,020
Because the fucking skull
is stronger than the knock.

2046
00:54:07,021 --> 00:54:08,350
All though the reality is,

2047
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,480
and one of the things about boxing gloves,

2048
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:10,991
his boxing,

2049
00:54:10,991 --> 00:54:13,180
those actually help protect your hand.

2050
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:15,480
Look how many guys break their
hands in boxing by hitting.

2051
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:16,320
Yeah,

2052
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:16,921
Floyd breaks.

2053
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:17,860
It's unbelievable.

2054
00:54:17,861 --> 00:54:20,170
But there isn't a lot
more hand damage in MMA.

2055
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:20,651
Yeah,

2056
00:54:20,651 --> 00:54:21,190
it is.

2057
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:21,640
I mean,

2058
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,110
well there is a lot though.

2059
00:54:23,111 --> 00:54:25,840
If you really stop and think about
how many guys break their hands,

2060
00:54:25,841 --> 00:54:29,760
it's pretty extraordinary that the
point Floyd's hands were so bad.

2061
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:31,380
It was looked like he was
going to have to retire one.

2062
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:31,721
Yeah.

2063
00:54:31,721 --> 00:54:34,080
What did he want to doing about raising?

2064
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:34,391
Yeah,

2065
00:54:34,391 --> 00:54:35,890
you got some crazy good surgeons.

2066
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,150
Got little tiny hands.

2067
00:54:37,151 --> 00:54:37,920
It's weird.

2068
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:38,020
Oh,

2069
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:38,860
he's a tiny guy.

2070
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:39,140
Yeah.

2071
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:39,280
I mean,

2072
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,350
anybody who's ever met Floyd on TV,

2073
00:54:41,351 --> 00:54:42,184
everybody looks bad.

2074
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:43,023
He's tiny.

2075
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:43,661
Yeah.

2076
00:54:43,661 --> 00:54:44,291
But his,

2077
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:44,530
uh,

2078
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:45,010
he has to,

2079
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:48,790
he was using special gloves for a while
and he's pulling his punches and just,

2080
00:54:48,791 --> 00:54:50,900
just outbox and guys and Pitty Pat Numb,

2081
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:51,521
you know,

2082
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:53,460
he was breaking his hands
like crazy for a while.

2083
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:53,710
Right.

2084
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:53,831
Oh,

2085
00:54:53,831 --> 00:54:54,461
speaking of that,

2086
00:54:54,461 --> 00:54:55,241
have you seen this kid?

2087
00:54:55,241 --> 00:54:56,500
We didn't talk about this kid yet.

2088
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:57,520
The fuck's his name?

2089
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,510
Adrian Broner runner.

2090
00:54:58,570 --> 00:54:59,403
Yeah.

2091
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:01,451
God Damn,

2092
00:55:01,451 --> 00:55:02,170
that kid's good.

2093
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:03,130
I like him a lot.

2094
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:06,160
The whole shtick he's got
going on as fucking stupid.

2095
00:55:06,161 --> 00:55:06,700
You know,

2096
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,530
he's combing his hair
and fucking acting like,

2097
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:09,190
dude,

2098
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:10,810
nobody could be that fucking obnoxious.

2099
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,180
Nobody would hang out with
the guy ever who you are.

2100
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:14,310
He's just trying to get attention.

2101
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:14,591
I know,

2102
00:55:14,591 --> 00:55:15,520
but he's still good.

2103
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:15,761
Yeah.

2104
00:55:15,761 --> 00:55:16,570
He doesn't need it.

2105
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:18,190
[inaudible] good man.

2106
00:55:18,191 --> 00:55:19,320
It's like Floyd's brilliant.

2107
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:20,080
You know,

2108
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:20,351
he goes,

2109
00:55:20,351 --> 00:55:21,190
tries to finish.

2110
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,240
It's very dangerous.

2111
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:23,020
Very dangerous.

2112
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,990
How about this kid Reese from
fucking England at Farnam?

2113
00:55:25,991 --> 00:55:26,600
Yeah.

2114
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,280
Tough,

2115
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,470
tough calls them that,

2116
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,790
that I brought a pop gun to a gun fight.

2117
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:32,110
Yeah.

2118
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:32,831
That was the problem.

2119
00:55:32,831 --> 00:55:33,730
He couldn't sing them.

2120
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:34,780
The other thing too is,

2121
00:55:34,781 --> 00:55:35,350
you know,

2122
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:38,020
I've always been critical of
the European boxing style.

2123
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,910
That dude can box.

2124
00:55:39,911 --> 00:55:40,360
Yeah.

2125
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,590
Reese can read Bob Man.

2126
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,530
He's got great boxing skills and he uh,

2127
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:45,551
and you know,

2128
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:46,241
he hits hard to,

2129
00:55:46,241 --> 00:55:49,000
he hit Brian or with some shots he did
and he really sharpened up his head

2130
00:55:49,001 --> 00:55:49,960
movement for that fight.

2131
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:50,970
They said that that was the start.

2132
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,390
That was going to be the big issue,

2133
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:53,500
but he was still stiff,

2134
00:55:53,501 --> 00:55:54,000
but he's like,

2135
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:54,111
no,

2136
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:54,171
no,

2137
00:55:54,171 --> 00:55:54,341
no.

2138
00:55:54,341 --> 00:55:54,881
For this guy,

2139
00:55:54,881 --> 00:55:55,780
I'm going to move a lot.

2140
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:56,411
Yeah.

2141
00:55:56,411 --> 00:55:57,310
What a talented guy,

2142
00:55:57,311 --> 00:55:57,560
man.

2143
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,120
He look good.

2144
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:58,320
Yeah.

2145
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,200
Broner is amazing,

2146
00:55:59,201 --> 00:55:59,500
man.

2147
00:55:59,500 --> 00:55:59,951
He's a,

2148
00:55:59,951 --> 00:56:01,900
he's exciting and he's
going to move up to one 40,

2149
00:56:01,901 --> 00:56:02,470
hopefully.

2150
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:03,160
And uh,

2151
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:06,010
all a lot of good fights
for him at one 41 35.

2152
00:56:06,011 --> 00:56:06,640
It's like,

2153
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,110
it's pretty much cleaned it out already.

2154
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:09,940
Why Floyd went to showtime?

2155
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:11,381
You think so?

2156
00:56:11,381 --> 00:56:13,030
Because of Brona I don't know.

2157
00:56:13,031 --> 00:56:13,380
He's just,

2158
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:14,290
who's it going to fight over there?

2159
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,070
Well,

2160
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:16,000
I mean it's a Floyd.

2161
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,190
Well Floyd's one 47.

2162
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,100
I mean basically if Broner can run
one 40 and you can make one for you.

2163
00:56:21,101 --> 00:56:21,191
Yeah,

2164
00:56:21,191 --> 00:56:21,821
he's a big kid.

2165
00:56:21,821 --> 00:56:23,020
Won't be till so muscular,

2166
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:24,080
you know,

2167
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,320
fucking common nations that kid throws,

2168
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:27,460
they're awesome.

2169
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:31,210
Half half is like half the
amount of time they take to land.

2170
00:56:31,211 --> 00:56:31,481
Five,

2171
00:56:31,481 --> 00:56:32,314
six punches.

2172
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,320
Madison fast.

2173
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:34,563
I mean,

2174
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:39,170
I think right now Floyd's probably
his boxing is just like a little bit,

2175
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:41,140
probably a little too sharp,

2176
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:42,130
a little too clean.

2177
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,990
And other times that Reese popped him,

2178
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:44,960
what would Floyd do?

2179
00:56:44,961 --> 00:56:46,570
And Floyd be able to shut them down.

2180
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:51,330
But true Broner can put together
combinations like Jesus Christ.

2181
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:52,653
Yeah.

2182
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,730
The combinations that he landed on recent,

2183
00:56:54,731 --> 00:56:55,620
like the second and third.

2184
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:56,620
It's like Jesus.

2185
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:00,400
Unbelievable combinations
like ruthless speed.

2186
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:02,083
Love it.

2187
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,670
I love one is great fights,

2188
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:03,970
man.

2189
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:04,690
I love fights.

2190
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:06,370
I love when there's a new
guy that raises the bar.

2191
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,580
I stayed up and England til five
in the morning to watch that fight.

2192
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:10,400
Oh really?

2193
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,350
I was in the UK for the,

2194
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:12,890
for the Wembley fight.

2195
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:17,950
Whenever a guy comes along like a Roy
Jones Jr when he was in his prime or like

2196
00:57:17,951 --> 00:57:19,360
an Anderson Silva is right now.

2197
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:19,810
A lot of it,

2198
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:22,990
it's so fun to watch a guy
that's just like almost,

2199
00:57:22,991 --> 00:57:24,310
it feels like untouchable.

2200
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,060
He just like,

2201
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:25,361
wow,

2202
00:57:25,361 --> 00:57:26,590
what's going to happen here?

2203
00:57:26,591 --> 00:57:27,131
Like what is,

2204
00:57:27,131 --> 00:57:28,570
what's going to happen with this puzzle?

2205
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:29,051
Anderson?

2206
00:57:29,051 --> 00:57:30,340
So fucking fun to watch.

2207
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:32,350
I dread the day that dude retires.

2208
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:35,500
I used to think that Roy
Jones jr did some crazy shit.

2209
00:57:35,501 --> 00:57:37,840
Like we would put his hand behind
his back and then knock somebody out.

2210
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:42,040
But what he wouldn't do it standing
with his back to a cage and let it got,

2211
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:42,520
come on.

2212
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,170
Come on.

2213
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:45,550
Waste 205 pounds and is on steroids.

2214
00:57:45,551 --> 00:57:46,650
Fucking take shots out of,

2215
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:47,503
how about that,

2216
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:48,210
right?

2217
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:49,000
Yeah.

2218
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,170
And then blast them and drop them
with like a perfectly placed knee

2219
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:54,411
if you knew how,

2220
00:57:54,411 --> 00:57:55,244
you know.

2221
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:56,060
Um,

2222
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:58,340
Bonner flew home with me after
that cause he was having a baby.

2223
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:00,590
If you knew how freaked
out he was by that fight.

2224
00:58:00,591 --> 00:58:01,400
The fight just fucking,

2225
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,210
he's like,

2226
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:04,340
that dude lives in the
matrix that dude lives.

2227
00:58:04,341 --> 00:58:04,701
And he says,

2228
00:58:04,701 --> 00:58:06,650
nobody's ever done that to me before.

2229
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:07,101
I mean,

2230
00:58:07,101 --> 00:58:11,360
he just treated me like I was nothing
and I've never fought before and he was

2231
00:58:11,361 --> 00:58:12,194
fucking tripping.

2232
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:13,800
It was a trippy fine.

2233
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:14,970
It was trippy to watch,

2234
00:58:14,971 --> 00:58:17,640
especially considering that it's like
way above his weight class and he

2235
00:58:17,641 --> 00:58:19,590
manhandled Bonner when,

2236
00:58:19,591 --> 00:58:19,861
when,

2237
00:58:19,861 --> 00:58:20,770
when they got in a clinch,

2238
00:58:20,771 --> 00:58:23,880
she tripped him and then he just
perfectly timed bond or stand up.

2239
00:58:23,881 --> 00:58:24,410
And as soon as the,

2240
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:25,243
or stood up,

2241
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:25,831
boom,

2242
00:58:25,831 --> 00:58:27,330
blasted him in the solar plexus.

2243
00:58:27,331 --> 00:58:27,481
I mean,

2244
00:58:27,481 --> 00:58:30,570
he was like getting shot by a
cannon and he just went down.

2245
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:33,090
When was the last time a guy went down
with the need of the body like that

2246
00:58:33,091 --> 00:58:33,600
before?

2247
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:33,811
Yeah.

2248
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:34,644
And No.

2249
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:35,020
I mean,

2250
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:35,853
that was,

2251
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:36,331
yeah,

2252
00:58:36,331 --> 00:58:37,620
like he got shot.

2253
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:38,191
I mean,

2254
00:58:38,191 --> 00:58:41,070
that's what he does when he throws
that man manager ruins people.

2255
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:41,900
Yeah.

2256
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:42,171
I mean,

2257
00:58:42,171 --> 00:58:42,550
look at the,

2258
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:44,780
it's the same way when he
was being rich Franklin.

2259
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:45,290
Uh,

2260
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:45,580
you know,

2261
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:46,730
grabbing that Clinton was just

2262
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:49,731
phenomenal.

2263
00:58:49,731 --> 00:58:49,941
Man.

2264
00:58:49,941 --> 00:58:51,350
The guy is just an amazing fighter

2265
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,160
and he's in his prime right now.

2266
00:58:53,161 --> 00:58:53,551
He's like,

2267
00:58:53,551 --> 00:58:58,140
got that perfect combination of
confidence and experience and success.

2268
00:58:58,380 --> 00:58:58,980
Yeah.

2269
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:03,470
He's insight has own right now to
make him and fucking Jones happened.

2270
00:59:03,471 --> 00:59:03,631
Man.

2271
00:59:03,631 --> 00:59:04,750
I have to make that fight happen.

2272
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:08,190
Do you think the one finance
talking about going to one 70,

2273
00:59:08,191 --> 00:59:08,491
right?

2274
00:59:08,491 --> 00:59:09,690
He's talking about going to one side.

2275
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:10,780
What,

2276
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:11,081
what,

2277
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:14,490
what Anderson's talking about what
we're Anderson really talks about.

2278
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:15,930
You fucks with the media a lot.

2279
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:17,520
What do you really talks about?

2280
00:59:17,521 --> 00:59:18,354
His big fights.

2281
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,380
He wants big fights,

2282
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:20,243
you know?

2283
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,473
Um,

2284
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:22,070
so he's got

2285
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:22,881
to walk this fine line.

2286
00:59:22,881 --> 00:59:24,560
We're probably going to do a
10 fight deal with this guy,

2287
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:25,400
which is amazing.

2288
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:26,853
Um,

2289
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:29,530
he's going to be 38 and
to have them under it,

2290
00:59:29,531 --> 00:59:30,364
another 10 fights.

2291
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:31,490
God,

2292
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:33,170
I hope this guy fights 10 more times.

2293
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:33,801
You know,

2294
00:59:33,801 --> 00:59:34,760
I hope it's possible.

2295
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:35,330
Yeah.

2296
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:35,900
I love,

2297
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:36,733
I just,

2298
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:38,061
you know,

2299
00:59:38,061 --> 00:59:40,640
it's like when I saw this Broner kid
and like when you see somebody that's

2300
00:59:40,641 --> 00:59:41,041
special,

2301
00:59:41,041 --> 00:59:44,000
the guys that really got
something really special,

2302
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:46,970
it's just Anderson Silva's
fucking unbelievable.

2303
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,290
He is unbelievable.

2304
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:48,651
And you'd go,

2305
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:49,080
man,

2306
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,150
why was he going to keep that up?

2307
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:52,130
But then you look at Herschel Walker,

2308
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:57,170
Herschel Walker is like almost 50
years old and he's fucking shredded,

2309
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:57,650
right?

2310
00:59:57,650 --> 00:59:58,041
I mean,

2311
00:59:58,041 --> 00:59:59,280
he looks amazing.

2312
00:59:59,300 --> 00:59:59,930
He does.

2313
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:03,770
And they said that Hershel Walker was
training with like young football players

2314
01:00:03,771 --> 01:00:05,240
and he was out running them out,

2315
01:00:05,241 --> 01:00:06,140
conditioning them.

2316
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:06,921
I mean like,

2317
01:00:06,921 --> 01:00:07,650
people are like going,

2318
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:09,680
what the fuck is going on?

2319
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:11,960
He's almost 50 years old.

2320
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,340
And then Bernard Hopkins,

2321
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:14,870
he's fighting for the
light heavyweight title.

2322
01:00:14,871 --> 01:00:17,690
He's 48 48 fucking years old.

2323
01:00:17,691 --> 01:00:19,040
Hock Hopkins is shocking,

2324
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,470
especially in boxing and
everyone's like that.

2325
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:22,363
But you know,

2326
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:26,630
I'm pretty sure Hopkins was in jail
early on in his career for a while.

2327
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:29,690
So he had a big layoff
early when he was young,

2328
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:30,470
you know,

2329
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:31,790
and always took care of himself.

2330
01:00:31,791 --> 01:00:32,624
Stayed in shape.

2331
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:33,651
No drugs,

2332
01:00:33,651 --> 01:00:34,251
no alcohol,

2333
01:00:34,251 --> 01:00:34,631
no bolts.

2334
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,260
Makes it makes a big difference.

2335
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:36,420
Yeah.

2336
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:37,041
The discipline.

2337
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:38,030
He's never out of shape,

2338
01:00:38,031 --> 01:00:41,630
so he never allows himself to have to
work back to get their party and kills

2339
01:00:41,631 --> 01:00:42,464
fighters.

2340
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,490
Kels Amanda's,

2341
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:44,720
I saw it happen to chuck.

2342
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:45,620
Yeah.

2343
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:46,010
Yeah,

2344
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:46,670
it does.

2345
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:48,140
We've seen so many guys like that.

2346
01:00:48,141 --> 01:00:48,590
They're just,

2347
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:53,590
they get so crazy with the success and
they so crazy with the buzzy fucking king

2348
01:00:54,471 --> 01:00:55,250
of the world.

2349
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:56,083
It's so hard,

2350
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:58,610
so hard to do the whole,

2351
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:02,480
the whole chocolate Dell era when
when chuck beat Tito that night,

2352
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:04,160
it's just fucking,

2353
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:05,691
it was crazy,

2354
01:01:05,691 --> 01:01:06,260
man.

2355
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:06,800
You know,

2356
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,360
I didn't bend together since,

2357
01:01:08,361 --> 01:01:12,290
since 1997 or something like that.

2358
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:13,760
98 maybe.

2359
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:19,030
And then to see that fucking explosion
and just how this dude became so huge,

2360
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:21,080
like after his fights,

2361
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,780
everybody wanted a piece of that guy.

2362
01:01:23,781 --> 01:01:24,710
It was insane.

2363
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:25,970
It was fucking insane,

2364
01:01:25,971 --> 01:01:26,180
man.

2365
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:27,440
I've never seen anything like it.

2366
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:28,071
Yeah.

2367
01:01:28,071 --> 01:01:29,270
He rode like a wild,

2368
01:01:29,271 --> 01:01:32,870
crazy wave for like four or
five years and then just like,

2369
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:33,350
all right,

2370
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:34,183
now it's like,

2371
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:36,020
now he's like back to
being a normal dude again.

2372
01:01:36,021 --> 01:01:36,370
Yeah.

2373
01:01:36,370 --> 01:01:37,031
It's really sad.

2374
01:01:37,031 --> 01:01:38,510
He's completely fucking normal.

2375
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,470
And which is good.

2376
01:01:39,471 --> 01:01:39,951
I'm happy,

2377
01:01:39,951 --> 01:01:40,240
man.

2378
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:40,610
Yeah,

2379
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:41,031
he did it.

2380
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:46,031
He got fucking crazy when it was time to
get crazy and then he settled down and

2381
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,240
very impressive.

2382
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:50,270
It makes me wonder if he
hadn't partied how much,

2383
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:52,700
how much longer he could have stayed.

2384
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:53,421
But you know what?

2385
01:01:53,421 --> 01:01:56,140
That dude made so much fucking money and,

2386
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:57,440
and you know he's,

2387
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,640
he said he's good.

2388
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:00,230
It was also his style.

2389
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,450
His style was so aggressive.

2390
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:02,810
Yeah.

2391
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:06,410
He was such a destroyer that like
that style you put yourself in danger.

2392
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:10,670
And it was also that he had
this incredible Chin and
he had this willingness to

2393
01:02:10,671 --> 01:02:11,150
trade.

2394
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:11,480
Yup.

2395
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:11,810
He would,

2396
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:13,150
he would get in there and he had the will,

2397
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:13,461
he would,

2398
01:02:13,461 --> 01:02:15,110
he would eat one to give one.

2399
01:02:15,111 --> 01:02:18,020
And that's what made him so perfect too,

2400
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:19,980
for the time we were coming

2401
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:20,520
up.

2402
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,280
Because you had all these guys that
understood boxing and not a lot of people

2403
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:24,330
understood the ground game.

2404
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:28,440
And that was what people loved about this
guy who's a fucking warhorse who just

2405
01:02:28,441 --> 01:02:29,310
moved forward,

2406
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:29,811
you know,

2407
01:02:29,811 --> 01:02:31,080
an eat shots to give,

2408
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:31,590
you know,

2409
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:33,750
he'd take three to give
you that one fucking,

2410
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:34,680
you know,

2411
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,250
boom.

2412
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:38,790
And it was at a time where a lot
of people thought the ground part.

2413
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:41,340
Like if there weren't like
really good practitioners,

2414
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:43,350
like some people an into the ground part,

2415
01:02:43,351 --> 01:02:44,250
they would have like blue.

2416
01:02:44,251 --> 01:02:48,180
We'll chuck was the best guy at avoiding
it and the best guide getting back up

2417
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:49,350
when he would hit the ground,

2418
01:02:49,351 --> 01:02:51,810
he had bullied immediately
explode with under hooks,

2419
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:53,310
scoot his hips back.

2420
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,140
He would be up quicker than anybody.

2421
01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:56,550
And even if you took him down,

2422
01:02:56,551 --> 01:02:58,470
except Randy ran was
the only guy that ever,

2423
01:02:58,471 --> 01:03:00,150
that was able to take them
down to hold them down.

2424
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:01,230
But that was when chuck,

2425
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:01,801
you didn't,

2426
01:03:01,801 --> 01:03:03,660
he didn't take that fight seriously.

2427
01:03:03,661 --> 01:03:03,870
Now

2428
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:04,470
Dude,

2429
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:05,580
I'll never forget that.

2430
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:09,270
As long as I fucking live the
night before he fako tour,

2431
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:14,280
it's like two 30 in the morning at the
hard rock and I'm walking through the

2432
01:03:14,281 --> 01:03:17,100
hard rock and he's fucking
there at the hard rock.

2433
01:03:17,101 --> 01:03:17,934
I go,

2434
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:19,530
what the fuck are you doing?

2435
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:20,640
Why?

2436
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:21,570
Why are you here?

2437
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:24,010
How do Doug's Road?

2438
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:26,280
But I can worry about it.

2439
01:03:26,290 --> 01:03:26,611
I'm done.

2440
01:03:26,611 --> 01:03:27,444
You know what I'm doing?

2441
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:27,991
I said,

2442
01:03:27,991 --> 01:03:28,710
dude,

2443
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:31,740
get your fucking punk
ass home and go to bed.

2444
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,300
Are you fucking crazy?

2445
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,553
You know what I mean?

2446
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:37,560
It was just such a given that
he was going to win this fight.

2447
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:38,380
Wow.

2448
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:39,480
And you know,

2449
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:41,903
I've seen that.

2450
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:45,350
I've seen guys that were fighting where
I ran into him at three o'clock in the

2451
01:03:45,351 --> 01:03:45,531
morning.

2452
01:03:45,531 --> 01:03:47,870
I ran into Ken shamrock in a diner.

2453
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:52,460
It was 3:30 AM in Florida when
he was going to fight Tito.

2454
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,110
He was gonna Fight Tito at the hard rock.

2455
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:54,351
Right.

2456
01:03:54,351 --> 01:03:55,184
I remember that.

2457
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:56,151
That was a big fight.

2458
01:03:56,151 --> 01:03:59,360
It was like three 30 in the morning
and we were getting breakfast and a,

2459
01:03:59,361 --> 01:04:00,390
and Ken walked in,

2460
01:04:00,391 --> 01:04:00,620
I'm like,

2461
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:01,760
aren't you fighting today?

2462
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:02,860
And uh,

2463
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:04,010
he was just all smiles.

2464
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:04,230
He,

2465
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:05,063
that was the one

2466
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:08,970
that was the one that I had to do for
free because the paper view one sucks so

2467
01:04:08,971 --> 01:04:09,750
bad.

2468
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:12,270
Remember they fought and the paper
view and then the ref jumped in.

2469
01:04:12,271 --> 01:04:13,800
And stop it and Ken jump right back up.

2470
01:04:13,801 --> 01:04:13,951
Like,

2471
01:04:13,951 --> 01:04:15,900
what the fuck stopped that fight?

2472
01:04:15,901 --> 01:04:16,920
I was still in this thing,

2473
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:17,730
you know?

2474
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:18,510
That's fine.

2475
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:23,130
I did the fight again for free at
the hard rock and we put it on spike.

2476
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:24,380
That's right.

2477
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:25,453
That's right.

2478
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:28,730
3:30 AM he was getting
breakfast is hanging out.

2479
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,031
I was like,

2480
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:29,930
you're not in bed yet.

2481
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:31,130
Jesus Christ.

2482
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:32,013
Uh,

2483
01:04:32,590 --> 01:04:33,020
yeah.

2484
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:33,640
Well,

2485
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:34,473
it showed

2486
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:39,070
Ken hit a point in his career
where he was just sorta cashing it.

2487
01:04:39,071 --> 01:04:39,590
Yeah.

2488
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:40,460
There's no doubt about it.

2489
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:40,791
I mean,

2490
01:04:40,791 --> 01:04:43,970
he was unbelievably
ferocious in his early days.

2491
01:04:43,971 --> 01:04:44,241
You know,

2492
01:04:44,241 --> 01:04:45,350
you'd go back and you watch,

2493
01:04:45,351 --> 01:04:46,100
uh,

2494
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:46,401
like,

2495
01:04:46,401 --> 01:04:46,670
uh,

2496
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:47,810
some of his early fights.

2497
01:04:47,811 --> 01:04:48,021
I mean,

2498
01:04:48,021 --> 01:04:49,220
you say he was a fucking animal.

2499
01:04:49,221 --> 01:04:49,971
He went after it.

2500
01:04:49,971 --> 01:04:51,440
But then after awhile it's like,

2501
01:04:51,441 --> 01:04:52,790
how many times can you do that?

2502
01:04:52,791 --> 01:04:53,510
You know,

2503
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:55,490
how many times can you have those,

2504
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:57,230
those brutal fights over and over again?

2505
01:04:57,231 --> 01:04:58,250
Those fights that he had over.

2506
01:04:58,251 --> 01:04:59,300
And Pride too.

2507
01:04:59,301 --> 01:05:02,180
It's like after a while it's like there's,

2508
01:05:02,181 --> 01:05:03,320
there's not much left.

2509
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:04,280
You got a catch him.

2510
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:05,000
I agree.

2511
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,540
When you see guys like Dan Severen and
he seemed like Dan was like recently

2512
01:05:08,541 --> 01:05:09,110
retired,

2513
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:09,440
right?

2514
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:09,681
I mean,

2515
01:05:09,681 --> 01:05:10,520
how old is he now?

2516
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:13,700
He's in his fifties he's
in his 50s you know,

2517
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:16,700
that's one of the weirdest
aspects of the fight game.

2518
01:05:16,701 --> 01:05:18,560
Like you tell a guy to stop,

2519
01:05:18,930 --> 01:05:20,590
but you look at a guy like him though,

2520
01:05:20,591 --> 01:05:22,000
he's just such a fucking competitor.

2521
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:22,680
Has Been,

2522
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:23,560
was a wrestler.

2523
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:23,830
Yeah.

2524
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:25,630
These wrestlers are fucking tough man.

2525
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:26,883
And uh,

2526
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:28,263
you know,

2527
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,590
as crazy as it is,

2528
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:29,861
you know,

2529
01:05:29,861 --> 01:05:30,760
I respect the guy.

2530
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:31,330
Yeah,

2531
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:31,901
it's crazy.

2532
01:05:31,901 --> 01:05:32,734
But I respect him.

2533
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:33,251
Well,

2534
01:05:33,251 --> 01:05:34,750
he was doing his own thing.

2535
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:36,040
I'm telling you.

2536
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,960
And you know that she'd been
around the game long enough.

2537
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:41,950
These dudes were fucking born to do this.

2538
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:43,360
The guys who fight,

2539
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:46,120
we're put on this fucking earth
and they weren't fighting.

2540
01:05:46,121 --> 01:05:47,830
They'd be fucking some shit up somewhere.

2541
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:48,873
You know what I mean?

2542
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,140
It would be scary if,

2543
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:53,020
imagine you get some of these broader,

2544
01:05:53,270 --> 01:05:54,103
you,

2545
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,840
he gets some of these
fucking freaks out there.

2546
01:05:55,841 --> 01:05:59,230
It's like that want to try to control
people's lives and tell them what they can

2547
01:05:59,231 --> 01:06:00,880
do and people shouldn't be fighting.

2548
01:06:00,881 --> 01:06:03,670
And people shut the fuck people
shouldn't be playing golf asshole.

2549
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:04,623
You know what I mean?

2550
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:05,680
That's what I think.

2551
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,230
So does that really mean people
shouldn't be playing fucking golf?

2552
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:09,210
No.

2553
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:09,421
Well,

2554
01:06:09,421 --> 01:06:11,940
I think the idea that they're saying
by saying that people shouldn't be

2555
01:06:11,941 --> 01:06:12,301
fighting,

2556
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:12,511
is it?

2557
01:06:12,511 --> 01:06:16,400
You're encouraging something that's a
antisocial behavior or something that's a

2558
01:06:16,401 --> 01:06:19,260
bit and contrary to the
way we want society to be.

2559
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:21,380
You want to see antisocial behavior,

2560
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:24,520
make it so these guys
can't fucking fights.

2561
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:24,830
Maybe.

2562
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:25,760
So there's no outlet.

2563
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:28,850
Maybe what happens time down
and make them watch opera.

2564
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,500
They'll go get the hook out on you.

2565
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,090
Never fucking that.

2566
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:33,380
I Ran Barkley.

2567
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:34,440
Yeah.

2568
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,310
Some after some fight I ran Barkley,

2569
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:36,950
the guy asked him,

2570
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:37,360
said,

2571
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,210
so if you weren't fighting,

2572
01:06:38,211 --> 01:06:38,970
what would you be doing?

2573
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:39,171
He said,

2574
01:06:39,171 --> 01:06:40,670
that'd be robbing your house right now.

2575
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:41,570
You know?

2576
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:43,220
And those dudes were fucking serious.

2577
01:06:43,221 --> 01:06:45,140
I mean if you ask those guys in boxing,

2578
01:06:45,141 --> 01:06:46,640
some of the guys from the old days,

2579
01:06:46,641 --> 01:06:47,540
it came from boxing,

2580
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:51,140
they'd be fucking dead or in
jail or doing something bad.

2581
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:51,681
You know,

2582
01:06:51,681 --> 01:06:56,681
boxing in a lot of other combat sports
has taken people out of the streets and

2583
01:06:58,251 --> 01:06:58,761
fucking dude,

2584
01:06:58,761 --> 01:07:01,970
me and Mike Tyson have
talked about this for hours,

2585
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:03,860
for fucking hours about it.

2586
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:07,670
He talks about what he would have
been doing if he didn't fucking,

2587
01:07:07,671 --> 01:07:07,970
if,

2588
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:11,380
if he at first of all he didn't hook up
with cuffs and he didn't go up there and

2589
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:12,081
any and he didn't,

2590
01:07:12,081 --> 01:07:16,460
he said cusp broke me down as a fucking
human being and then built me back up

2591
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:17,540
and he said,

2592
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:20,870
I honestly truly believe that me and him
were put together cause he's the only

2593
01:07:20,871 --> 01:07:24,020
one that could have fucking
done it because let me tell
you what I would've been

2594
01:07:24,021 --> 01:07:26,690
doing if I didn't meet costs
and I didn't get into boxing.

2595
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:27,381
Yeah.

2596
01:07:27,381 --> 01:07:29,780
He had so much respect
for that guy as a trainer.

2597
01:07:29,781 --> 01:07:33,140
And so much respect for him as a father
figure that they look inspired him to

2598
01:07:33,410 --> 01:07:37,700
greatness and inspired him to focus a
hundred percent on pleasing that guy

2599
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:40,790
because that was the first guy to really
show them love and to really show him

2600
01:07:40,791 --> 01:07:41,990
respect and to have,

2601
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,940
have faith in him and then under him,

2602
01:07:43,941 --> 01:07:44,421
all of a sudden,

2603
01:07:44,421 --> 01:07:45,670
all these great things are happening,

2604
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:46,910
all the successes happening.

2605
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:48,590
So it reinforced his love for him.

2606
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:52,040
Annie talked about how much fucking
anger he had inside of him at that time.

2607
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:54,170
He had a lot of anger that needed to be,

2608
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:54,830
uh,

2609
01:07:54,830 --> 01:07:55,100
you know,

2610
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:55,630
expressed.

2611
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:56,320
Yes.

2612
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:56,480
Yes.

2613
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:56,611
Well,

2614
01:07:56,611 --> 01:07:57,890
do you watch those combinations?

2615
01:07:57,891 --> 01:08:00,710
See throws when he's training
with cost is a video of him,

2616
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:01,753
I think.

2617
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:03,230
I think it's,

2618
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:06,800
I don't know if it's Kevin Rooney or
teddy atlas or who's working with them,

2619
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:10,880
but he's thrown off combinations on the
bag and he's probably like 18 years old

2620
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:11,963
and it's like,

2621
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:16,640
and you're just watching
the sec ridiculous,

2622
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:17,601
ruthless,

2623
01:08:17,601 --> 01:08:20,690
violent combinations like no
one has ever thrown before.

2624
01:08:20,691 --> 01:08:22,580
I don't give a fuck about Joe Louis.

2625
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:24,320
Muhammad Ali was the greatest.

2626
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:25,130
Yes,

2627
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:26,690
a great cultural figure.

2628
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:28,250
A great boxer for his era.

2629
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:31,670
I think Mike Tyson was the
greatest freak that's ever existed.

2630
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:33,380
I don't think it's ever
been anybody like that.

2631
01:08:33,381 --> 01:08:33,860
I agree.

2632
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,090
The Marvis Frazier fight,

2633
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:36,583
you remember that fine.

2634
01:08:36,890 --> 01:08:37,930
Jesus Christ.

2635
01:08:37,931 --> 01:08:41,510
And that was as close to a murder as
you could watch on television when you

2636
01:08:41,511 --> 01:08:42,350
start to watch stuff

2637
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,070
for old fights at Tyson coming up,

2638
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:45,620
there's guys that he just,

2639
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:46,520
Ooh,

2640
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:51,530
fucking murder murder Frank
Bruno fight just loved him.

2641
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:52,840
And the,

2642
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:53,390
at the,

2643
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:55,970
at the time when I was first coming up,

2644
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:56,570
you know,

2645
01:08:56,570 --> 01:08:56,810
and,

2646
01:08:56,810 --> 01:08:58,400
and in boxing right,

2647
01:08:58,490 --> 01:09:02,000
there was a gym called golden gloves and
golden gloves was the first gym that I

2648
01:09:02,001 --> 01:09:03,050
worked out of the Vegas.

2649
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:04,213
And uh,

2650
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:07,610
they used to shut the place down
from Mike when Mike would come in.

2651
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:08,360
Right.

2652
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:12,530
So He'd come in and train their be fucking
50 brand new cars that would pull in

2653
01:09:12,531 --> 01:09:13,181
the fucking park.

2654
01:09:13,181 --> 01:09:14,014
It was right,

2655
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:14,300
dude.

2656
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,260
It was craziness.

2657
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:20,750
The aura that surrounded Tyson at that
time and just all the crazy shit that

2658
01:09:20,751 --> 01:09:21,051
went on.

2659
01:09:21,051 --> 01:09:22,400
But Tigers.

2660
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:23,263
Yeah,

2661
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:26,420
tigers Everlast made
a special bag for him,

2662
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:30,050
so they'd come in and take down
the bags in the fucking gym,

2663
01:09:30,051 --> 01:09:30,950
the real bags,

2664
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:34,880
and they'd put up these special
bags that were fucking this big.

2665
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:35,960
They were just massive.

2666
01:09:35,961 --> 01:09:40,160
You couldn't put your arms around them
right when he would hit a regular fucking

2667
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:41,450
bag that you would buy.

2668
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:44,300
You know when you break
a firecracker and half,

2669
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,730
that's what the fucking bag would
look like when he would hit it.

2670
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:50,090
The fucking thing would snap in half
this way and come back this way.

2671
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:55,880
The fucking power that this guy had when
he punched you had to be there to see

2672
01:09:55,881 --> 01:09:57,560
it in person to really believe it.

2673
01:09:57,561 --> 01:09:58,250
Like you said,

2674
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:58,831
the combination.

2675
01:09:58,831 --> 01:10:02,330
Do you see him throwing in the bag
and just if when you saw it in person,

2676
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:03,050
you were just like,

2677
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:03,860
what?

2678
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:05,010
I love to see that in person.

2679
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:09,590
You need to see what you have to do is
you have to go see his fucking standup.

2680
01:10:09,591 --> 01:10:10,424
Show me,

2681
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:11,420
bro.

2682
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:14,240
If you even remotely like
Tyson back in the day,

2683
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:17,150
the Mitch Blood Green Story that he tells,

2684
01:10:17,151 --> 01:10:18,200
I'm not gonna fuck with it.

2685
01:10:18,201 --> 01:10:19,550
Cause if you got to see Tyson,

2686
01:10:19,551 --> 01:10:22,250
tell it it now is awesome.

2687
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:22,421
He's,

2688
01:10:22,421 --> 01:10:22,970
he just,

2689
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:23,810
he's on tour,

2690
01:10:23,811 --> 01:10:23,961
right?

2691
01:10:23,961 --> 01:10:25,160
He just called me today.

2692
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:26,280
He just called me today.

2693
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:26,580
He's,

2694
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:27,800
he's got a reality show.

2695
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:28,430
What?

2696
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:30,140
So he asked me to be in this reality show.

2697
01:10:30,141 --> 01:10:30,701
Oh my God.

2698
01:10:30,701 --> 01:10:33,350
So I start filming his reality
show with them like next week.

2699
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:34,370
Oh my God.

2700
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:35,120
The

2701
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,610
odd couple is my container.

2702
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:36,961
Yeah.

2703
01:10:36,961 --> 01:10:37,161
No,

2704
01:10:37,161 --> 01:10:37,340
it's,

2705
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:38,480
it's not just me and him.

2706
01:10:38,481 --> 01:10:43,010
It just fucking doing a cameo or
so I don't what he wants from me,

2707
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:45,050
but every time he asked
me to do them a favor,

2708
01:10:45,051 --> 01:10:45,351
I'm like,

2709
01:10:45,351 --> 01:10:45,531
dude,

2710
01:10:45,531 --> 01:10:46,400
I do anything.

2711
01:10:46,430 --> 01:10:48,020
This isn't a weird on my cousin calls.

2712
01:10:48,021 --> 01:10:48,290
Yeah.

2713
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:49,310
And do you look at your phone and go,

2714
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:49,791
Holy Shit,

2715
01:10:49,791 --> 01:10:50,624
Mike Tyson's corner.

2716
01:10:50,930 --> 01:10:54,560
I fucking Dude Tyson is
my favorite all time.

2717
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:54,831
You know,

2718
01:10:54,831 --> 01:10:55,700
I fucking love Mike.

2719
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:58,160
He's one of my favorite
all time fighters as well.

2720
01:10:58,161 --> 01:10:59,720
There was nothing like a Tyson fight.

2721
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:00,230
Yeah,

2722
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:00,861
exactly.

2723
01:11:00,861 --> 01:11:01,461
What different.

2724
01:11:01,461 --> 01:11:02,660
They were different experiences.

2725
01:11:02,661 --> 01:11:03,310
So true.

2726
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:06,200
You know when you saw him fight
somebody like Jesus Christ,

2727
01:11:06,201 --> 01:11:09,560
how's Tony Tub's going to do
to him when you're watching,

2728
01:11:09,561 --> 01:11:11,060
I'll give a fuck if you are there live.

2729
01:11:11,061 --> 01:11:13,350
Which I was very lucky
that I was able to do that.

2730
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:13,891
You know,

2731
01:11:13,891 --> 01:11:14,070
go

2732
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:18,210
to a few Mike Tyson fights live when he
fought or if you were sitting at home

2733
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:19,830
watching TV.

2734
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:22,590
As soon as they fucking showed
him on camera walking out,

2735
01:11:22,591 --> 01:11:24,300
you just fucking got
the goosebumps and went,

2736
01:11:24,370 --> 01:11:25,630
oh my God.

2737
01:11:25,730 --> 01:11:26,910
He was a terrible

2738
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:27,550
fine.

2739
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:32,550
I love that scene in the movie Tyson
where he talks about what's going through

2740
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:33,460
his mind.

2741
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:35,260
All his insecurities go away.

2742
01:11:35,261 --> 01:11:38,350
By the time he gets to the cane where
he got Tommy gets in the ring rather.

2743
01:11:38,351 --> 01:11:38,680
Yeah.

2744
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:41,150
That is such a great with the way
he's talking through it there.

2745
01:11:41,170 --> 01:11:41,981
I'm a God.

2746
01:11:41,981 --> 01:11:42,450
I'm in

2747
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:42,721
dark.

2748
01:11:42,721 --> 01:11:43,170
The bowl,

2749
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:44,003
there's nothing,

2750
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:44,880
there's nothing.

2751
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:45,510
I mean,

2752
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:47,280
when you watch a Tyson documentary,

2753
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:48,690
it's fucking awesome.

2754
01:11:48,691 --> 01:11:49,470
You just,

2755
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:50,303
you're an awe.

2756
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:51,090
I just,

2757
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:51,331
yeah,

2758
01:11:51,331 --> 01:11:54,840
it was a completely different cultural
experience than like the Muhammad Ali era

2759
01:11:54,841 --> 01:11:59,100
must've been because the Muhammad Ali
thing was like Muhammad Ali was different

2760
01:11:59,101 --> 01:12:01,470
because he was so much more
admirable as a human being.

2761
01:12:01,471 --> 01:12:04,080
Like what he did was like
during the Vietnam War,

2762
01:12:04,081 --> 01:12:04,441
he said,

2763
01:12:04,441 --> 01:12:05,071
you know what man?

2764
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:05,881
Why are we going to war?

2765
01:12:05,881 --> 01:12:06,121
Why?

2766
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:06,421
Why do you,

2767
01:12:06,421 --> 01:12:07,410
why are you sending me to war?

2768
01:12:07,411 --> 01:12:07,471
Well,

2769
01:12:07,471 --> 01:12:08,880
I don't want to kill no Viet Cong.

2770
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:10,140
No Viet Cong never did anyway.

2771
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:11,610
And then everybody in America was like,

2772
01:12:11,611 --> 01:12:12,181
yeah,

2773
01:12:12,181 --> 01:12:13,540
what the fuck is going on?

2774
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:14,980
What are you doing?

2775
01:12:14,981 --> 01:12:15,814
And then they took is,

2776
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:19,110
I mean they made a martyr out of him by
taking his career away for three years.

2777
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:21,000
So when you see like Muhammad Ali,

2778
01:12:21,001 --> 01:12:22,110
you see a different thing.

2779
01:12:22,111 --> 01:12:23,430
You see like a troubled time.

2780
01:12:23,431 --> 01:12:27,150
The Nixon administration and people were
down on the government and the Vietnam

2781
01:12:27,151 --> 01:12:28,440
War was so unpopular.

2782
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:29,880
When you see Mike Tyson,

2783
01:12:29,881 --> 01:12:32,190
you just saw destruction.

2784
01:12:32,430 --> 01:12:34,230
It was a completely different experience.

2785
01:12:34,530 --> 01:12:37,650
It's like he was like
Sonny Liston on meth.

2786
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:39,270
It was like Sonny Liston.

2787
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:42,930
But moving a hundred miles an hour and
there was no Muhammad Ali to stop him.

2788
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,280
There was no Muhammad Ali to,

2789
01:12:44,281 --> 01:12:44,790
you know,

2790
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:45,301
no young,

2791
01:12:45,301 --> 01:12:47,360
brash kid to be thrown in with boxing.

2792
01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:48,630
I always talk about when,

2793
01:12:48,631 --> 01:12:49,070
when,

2794
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:52,290
when I'm talking about the UFC to two
people who really don't understand

2795
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:53,940
fighting in the sport and stuff with that.

2796
01:12:53,941 --> 01:12:55,590
So the way that I usually
break it down for them,

2797
01:12:55,591 --> 01:12:55,921
as I say,

2798
01:12:55,921 --> 01:12:56,640
listen,

2799
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:57,480
you look at the NFL,

2800
01:12:57,481 --> 01:12:59,340
how big the NFL is been
trying to go over here,

2801
01:12:59,350 --> 01:12:59,910
go over there.

2802
01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:03,060
Crickets big over there and
every big over here fighting,

2803
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:03,660
you know,

2804
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:05,800
crosses all cultural and
language barriers and shit.

2805
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,050
No matter what color you are,

2806
01:13:07,051 --> 01:13:07,741
what country you come from,

2807
01:13:07,741 --> 01:13:08,341
what language speak,

2808
01:13:08,341 --> 01:13:10,410
we're human beings and
findings in our fucking DNA.

2809
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:12,420
What really,

2810
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:13,403
you know,

2811
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:16,890
when you really think about
fucking all the most famous guys,

2812
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,120
think about Michael Jordan,

2813
01:13:18,121 --> 01:13:18,954
how big he is.

2814
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:19,770
You know,

2815
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:21,600
people know Michael Jordan
and some parts of the world,

2816
01:13:21,601 --> 01:13:22,280
Gretzky,

2817
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:22,780
Eh,

2818
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:23,170
here and there.

2819
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:24,003
You think of all the grades.

2820
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:27,870
Think about who are really
fucking well known everywhere,

2821
01:13:27,871 --> 01:13:28,920
all of the fucking planet.

2822
01:13:28,921 --> 01:13:31,500
And worshipped guys like fucking Tyson.

2823
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:32,521
You know what I mean?

2824
01:13:32,521 --> 01:13:33,570
Muhammad Ali,

2825
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:34,730
Bruce Lee

2826
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:35,830
Klitschko.

2827
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:37,170
That motherfucker gets on a plane.

2828
01:13:37,190 --> 01:13:38,220
Nobody even pays attention to him,

2829
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:38,530
right?

2830
01:13:38,530 --> 01:13:40,720
I was on a plane with him
and my friend was like,

2831
01:13:40,721 --> 01:13:41,620
who's that fucking giant?

2832
01:13:41,621 --> 01:13:41,801
I go,

2833
01:13:41,801 --> 01:13:42,041
dude,

2834
01:13:42,041 --> 01:13:43,720
that's the heavyweight
boxing champion the world.

2835
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:44,410
So he goes,

2836
01:13:44,410 --> 01:13:46,180
the heavyweight boxing
champion is a white guy.

2837
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:46,691
I go,

2838
01:13:46,691 --> 01:13:47,021
yeah,

2839
01:13:47,021 --> 01:13:47,980
it's a white Russian guy.

2840
01:13:47,981 --> 01:13:48,910
He's a doctor.

2841
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:50,440
He's like a professor and shit.

2842
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:52,390
It's Vladimir Klitschko
is like a brilliant guy,

2843
01:13:52,391 --> 01:13:53,380
plays chess and shit.

2844
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,000
Dude is playing chess on his iPad.

2845
01:13:55,360 --> 01:14:00,100
The most boring fucking guys in
the history of the fucking sport.

2846
01:14:00,370 --> 01:14:02,800
The Klitschko brothers
drive me fucking crazy,

2847
01:14:02,801 --> 01:14:03,520
man.

2848
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,001
Jab,

2849
01:14:04,001 --> 01:14:04,361
Jab,

2850
01:14:04,361 --> 01:14:05,141
Whole Jab,

2851
01:14:05,141 --> 01:14:05,471
Jab,

2852
01:14:05,471 --> 01:14:06,161
Whole Jab,

2853
01:14:06,161 --> 01:14:06,491
hold.

2854
01:14:06,491 --> 01:14:06,720
Right?

2855
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:08,920
And yet fucking whole flight
mental put you to sleep.

2856
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:11,550
So no to me and right.

2857
01:14:11,551 --> 01:14:11,820
Yeah,

2858
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:12,060
me

2859
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:13,500
and Elliot and uh,

2860
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:14,581
I think Craig,

2861
01:14:14,581 --> 01:14:15,414
we're sorry,

2862
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,430
are in Beverly Hills.

2863
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:18,453
All right.

2864
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,160
I talk so much shit about the clinch.

2865
01:14:21,161 --> 01:14:22,680
Go brothers hall the fucking time,

2866
01:14:22,681 --> 01:14:23,070
man.

2867
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:25,440
All I do is fucking hammer these guys.

2868
01:14:25,441 --> 01:14:26,011
They're born,

2869
01:14:26,011 --> 01:14:27,180
it's soccer or this or that.

2870
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:28,253
They're fucking,

2871
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:28,660
they're,

2872
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:28,880
they're,

2873
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:29,131
you know,

2874
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:29,281
they're,

2875
01:14:29,281 --> 01:14:32,630
they're one of the big problems with
boxing and fucking heavyweights.

2876
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:34,530
Nobody cares as much shit as I can talk.

2877
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:38,010
So there's this little
restaurant in Beverly Hills,

2878
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:39,820
I'm called Elvis.

2879
01:14:39,821 --> 01:14:40,410
Stale,

2880
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:41,243
right?

2881
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:42,900
And it's literally fucking tiny,

2882
01:14:43,230 --> 01:14:44,130
but it's bad ass,

2883
01:14:44,131 --> 01:14:44,611
great food,

2884
01:14:44,611 --> 01:14:45,121
everything else.

2885
01:14:45,121 --> 01:14:46,290
So we go there for lunch one day,

2886
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:47,970
walk into the fucking restaurant,

2887
01:14:48,270 --> 01:14:51,660
both the Klitschko
brothers and they fucking,

2888
01:14:51,661 --> 01:14:52,151
I'll walk into,

2889
01:14:52,151 --> 01:14:53,010
they both look at me.

2890
01:14:53,011 --> 01:14:53,370
I'm like,

2891
01:14:53,370 --> 01:14:54,203
Oh fuck,

2892
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:55,700
let's go.

2893
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:56,730
Brothers are in here,

2894
01:14:56,731 --> 01:14:57,390
right?

2895
01:14:57,390 --> 01:14:58,290
So I said,

2896
01:14:58,291 --> 01:14:58,970
uh,

2897
01:14:58,970 --> 01:14:59,791
the lady says,

2898
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:01,170
would you like to eat inside or out?

2899
01:15:01,170 --> 01:15:01,381
I said,

2900
01:15:01,381 --> 01:15:02,191
I'll eat outside.

2901
01:15:02,191 --> 01:15:02,910
Thank you.

2902
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:03,451
So she'd take,

2903
01:15:03,451 --> 01:15:04,050
goes outside.

2904
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:05,730
We tell if I like you tell Ellie and I go,

2905
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:06,600
fucking,

2906
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,900
both the Klitschko brothers are in there
and they're both fucking staring at me.

2907
01:15:09,901 --> 01:15:10,380
I said,

2908
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:12,320
I'm probably going to get my
fucking ass whupped today.

2909
01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:12,810
I said,

2910
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:13,441
but don't worry.

2911
01:15:13,441 --> 01:15:14,181
It will be boring.

2912
01:15:14,181 --> 01:15:17,730
They'll jab and fucking hold me for about
20 minutes over on the fucking corner

2913
01:15:17,731 --> 01:15:18,360
here.

2914
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:18,661
And,

2915
01:15:18,661 --> 01:15:19,260
uh,

2916
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:22,350
so then they both get up and they walk
outside and they walk by our table and

2917
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:23,011
they were looking at me,

2918
01:15:23,011 --> 01:15:24,000
but they didn't say a word.

2919
01:15:24,001 --> 01:15:24,990
They didn't say anything to me,

2920
01:15:25,290 --> 01:15:26,040
you know?

2921
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,000
Do you think they knew that?

2922
01:15:27,630 --> 01:15:29,070
I didn't know if they did or didn't,

2923
01:15:29,071 --> 01:15:29,904
but you know,

2924
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:32,160
you know what I want somebody
talks enough shit about you.

2925
01:15:32,161 --> 01:15:33,520
You end up fucking hearing an event.

2926
01:15:34,110 --> 01:15:34,530
They were,

2927
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:35,370
they were kickboxer.

2928
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:35,611
Yeah,

2929
01:15:35,611 --> 01:15:36,211
I knew that.

2930
01:15:36,211 --> 01:15:37,160
So they were martial arts,

2931
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:39,050
so they'd probably watched the UFC anyway.

2932
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,880
The only makes sense that they do.

2933
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,140
You Seen Vitaly?

2934
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:44,450
There's a video of him
getting knocked out.

2935
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:45,860
He got a wheel kicked.

2936
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:48,470
Some guy knocked him out in some
sort of a karate tournament,

2937
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:49,430
you know,

2938
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:50,263
it was a,

2939
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:52,190
that's the son of a bitch.

2940
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:53,780
I'm a little young Joe.

2941
01:15:53,781 --> 01:15:53,931
Right.

2942
01:15:53,931 --> 01:15:54,711
That's a little young.

2943
01:15:54,711 --> 01:15:58,760
Me and I talked to one doe tournament and
knocked that Dude Down with a spinning

2944
01:15:58,761 --> 01:15:59,060
back kick.

2945
01:15:59,060 --> 01:15:59,511
I messed it.

2946
01:15:59,511 --> 01:16:00,110
Play it again.

2947
01:16:00,110 --> 01:16:00,710
Yeah.

2948
01:16:00,710 --> 01:16:02,270
That's from 1987,

2949
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:03,320
the U S Cup.

2950
01:16:03,530 --> 01:16:04,850
This guy just sent it to me,

2951
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:05,150
uh,

2952
01:16:05,150 --> 01:16:05,751
online.

2953
01:16:05,751 --> 01:16:06,590
He just found it.

2954
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:11,210
He had a like a VHS tape
of it from back in the day.

2955
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:11,541
Brian,

2956
01:16:11,541 --> 01:16:13,780
you are the worst fucking video that your,

2957
01:16:13,790 --> 01:16:15,020
your Internet sucks.

2958
01:16:16,190 --> 01:16:18,420
You don't have this already
loaded otherwise let it get it.

2959
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:24,201
The Joe,

2960
01:16:24,201 --> 01:16:24,800
no headgear,

2961
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:25,311
no nothing.

2962
01:16:25,311 --> 01:16:26,450
I had a headgear on.

2963
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:31,480
This is the head gear is like this little
shiny black porters kick him in the

2964
01:16:31,521 --> 01:16:34,460
head and the chest and the
chest spinning back kick.

2965
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:35,121
Yeah,

2966
01:16:35,121 --> 01:16:36,110
that was my technique.

2967
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:38,240
That's what I worked with
George Saint Pierre on.

2968
01:16:38,241 --> 01:16:38,421
Yeah,

2969
01:16:38,421 --> 01:16:38,990
I remember.

2970
01:16:38,990 --> 01:16:39,710
That was my,

2971
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:40,670
my specialty.

2972
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:41,091
All right,

2973
01:16:41,091 --> 01:16:41,440
Brian,

2974
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,273
stop.

2975
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:45,590
That was my favorite technique.

2976
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:45,951
It was.

2977
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,761
So when,

2978
01:16:46,761 --> 01:16:47,020
uh,

2979
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:48,290
George was looking for
someone to help him,

2980
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:48,950
I was like,

2981
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:50,450
this is gonna sound ridiculous,

2982
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:53,720
but I could probably teach you
that better than anybody could.

2983
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:54,950
And he actually listened to me,

2984
01:16:54,951 --> 01:16:56,360
which he shows you what a great guy.

2985
01:16:56,361 --> 01:16:57,194
He's just probably like,

2986
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:57,591
yeah,

2987
01:16:57,591 --> 01:16:58,371
I'm going to go.

2988
01:16:58,371 --> 01:17:02,930
Joe Rogan wants to fucking spend time
with me or something and bullshit to me.

2989
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:04,011
So I,

2990
01:17:04,011 --> 01:17:04,850
I was,

2991
01:17:04,851 --> 01:17:05,300
uh,

2992
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:08,480
very impressed that he actually
came down and trained with me.

2993
01:17:08,481 --> 01:17:11,560
I thought this never going to believe
me because I was talking to John Danaher

2994
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:12,860
and John Danaher was like,

2995
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:15,070
George needs help with a
spinning back kick he's getting,

2996
01:17:15,071 --> 01:17:16,190
he's got the mechanics wrong.

2997
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:17,031
And I was like,

2998
01:17:17,031 --> 01:17:18,290
this is going to sound ridiculous,

2999
01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:19,580
but I know the guy like,

3000
01:17:19,581 --> 01:17:19,851
hey,

3001
01:17:19,851 --> 01:17:20,684
I can help him.

3002
01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:22,550
But most people wouldn't listen.

3003
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:23,870
You know George actually,

3004
01:17:23,871 --> 01:17:24,200
listen,

3005
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,033
he's a crusty,

3006
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:27,130
I couldn't say enough good
things about George Saint Pierre.

3007
01:17:27,131 --> 01:17:27,591
He's such,

3008
01:17:27,591 --> 01:17:28,121
he's such a good,

3009
01:17:28,121 --> 01:17:28,200
yeah,

3010
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:28,720
verse man.

3011
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:33,370
He's the best example of what's
possible today in mixed martial arts.

3012
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,830
And he's a true martial artist.

3013
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,590
Like I think that's what's interesting
about what's going on with them and may

3014
01:17:38,591 --> 01:17:40,930
right now is that it's
kind of coming full circle.

3015
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:42,580
Like it was traditional martial arts.

3016
01:17:42,581 --> 01:17:45,220
In the beginning it was all about
bowing and respect and all that.

3017
01:17:45,221 --> 01:17:49,180
And then this became my brawlers and
sluggers and wrestlers with good haymaker

3018
01:17:49,181 --> 01:17:52,060
punches and now it's gone full circle.

3019
01:17:52,061 --> 01:17:55,480
And the greatest guys in the world are
bowing like George Saint Pierre Bowels,

3020
01:17:55,481 --> 01:17:57,030
Anderson Silva bows before.

3021
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:57,191
I mean,

3022
01:17:57,191 --> 01:17:59,140
these are real fucking martial artists.

3023
01:17:59,141 --> 01:17:59,371
They are.

3024
01:17:59,371 --> 01:18:00,610
They're Real Samurai.

3025
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:01,511
You know when there,

3026
01:18:01,511 --> 01:18:03,730
when George is living his life,

3027
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:08,590
he's living his life as a true martial
artist and he's elevating the sport to

3028
01:18:08,591 --> 01:18:10,210
the highest level right now.

3029
01:18:10,211 --> 01:18:10,780
I mean,

3030
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:13,900
you look at that fucking
170 pound division.

3031
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:15,910
That's a murderer's row,

3032
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:17,600
Hendrickson,

3033
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:19,660
condit and fucking Diaz.

3034
01:18:19,710 --> 01:18:24,310
You got a bunch of assassins in that
division just scrambling to get at him and

3035
01:18:24,311 --> 01:18:25,990
every time you see him he's better.

3036
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:27,190
Every time he see him,

3037
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:28,330
he puts another notch in his game.

3038
01:18:28,331 --> 01:18:29,410
He takes time off,

3039
01:18:29,411 --> 01:18:29,471
it,

3040
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:30,340
gets a knee surgery,

3041
01:18:30,341 --> 01:18:31,960
comes back bigger and stronger.

3042
01:18:31,961 --> 01:18:33,880
He's doing fucking gymnastics and just,

3043
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:35,070
I just,

3044
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:36,143
it physically,

3045
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:37,420
he's a true professional man.

3046
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:38,890
He gets better every time you say it.

3047
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:39,701
I was just saying today,

3048
01:18:39,701 --> 01:18:40,100
man,

3049
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:41,020
I just fucking,

3050
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:42,333
you know,

3051
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,420
the Diaz brothers,

3052
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:43,870
you know,

3053
01:18:43,870 --> 01:18:45,220
I respect the Diaz brothers.

3054
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,113
I like these guys.

3055
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:47,380
They're fun kids.

3056
01:18:47,410 --> 01:18:48,041
I like the,

3057
01:18:48,041 --> 01:18:48,220
the,

3058
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:49,053
you know,

3059
01:18:50,110 --> 01:18:55,110
$50,000 between the two of them now
and not showing up the film shit when,

3060
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:59,230
you know you've spent $50,000 that
fucking crews running around Stockton,

3061
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:00,100
you know,

3062
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:02,470
it costs money to send these
fucking guys up there that,

3063
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:02,801
you know,

3064
01:19:02,801 --> 01:19:04,390
you're paying these guys a,

3065
01:19:04,391 --> 01:19:05,980
these crews to do the ship by the day.

3066
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:06,521
You know,

3067
01:19:06,521 --> 01:19:08,770
the show that we're
trying to fill now is fox,

3068
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:10,053
you know,

3069
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:14,350
and then you got Cesar Gracie has the
balls to get on fucking Twitter and say,

3070
01:19:14,351 --> 01:19:15,550
hey upgrade next ticket,

3071
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:17,391
the rate Nick's going,

3072
01:19:17,391 --> 01:19:19,340
he's gonna be going to Montreal
and Fucking Gray Hound.

3073
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:19,931
He,

3074
01:19:19,931 --> 01:19:23,130
he's asking you to upgrade his
ticket out or missing event.

3075
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:23,320
Yeah.

3076
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:24,370
It's just crazy man.

3077
01:19:24,371 --> 01:19:24,730
It's,

3078
01:19:24,730 --> 01:19:25,870
it's fucking crazy.

3079
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:27,071
It's just like,

3080
01:19:27,071 --> 01:19:27,341
it's,

3081
01:19:27,341 --> 01:19:27,761
it's some,

3082
01:19:27,761 --> 01:19:31,210
some of the shit that goes on in this
and this fucking sports drives me nuts.

3083
01:19:31,211 --> 01:19:31,870
You know,

3084
01:19:31,870 --> 01:19:33,130
I love the Diaz brothers.

3085
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:33,600
They're crazy.

3086
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:34,361
I love the whole thing.

3087
01:19:34,361 --> 01:19:34,901
But you know,

3088
01:19:34,901 --> 01:19:37,030
it's like come on you guys come on.

3089
01:19:37,510 --> 01:19:38,820
Well who is response?

3090
01:19:38,821 --> 01:19:40,990
You know what else to putting
together a schedule a lot.

3091
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:42,941
Cause you know,

3092
01:19:42,941 --> 01:19:44,620
like I read his lawyer,

3093
01:19:44,621 --> 01:19:44,860
yes.

3094
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:46,390
Well here comes out says that wasn't true.

3095
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:47,560
He's a fucking liar.

3096
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:48,873
How dare you

3097
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:54,000
fucking have a fucking own it
fall down and start seasoning.

3098
01:19:54,001 --> 01:19:55,360
I'm going to have to give
you some weed or robot.

3099
01:19:57,670 --> 01:19:59,170
Some of the fans were asking me,

3100
01:19:59,550 --> 01:19:59,890
uh,

3101
01:19:59,890 --> 01:20:00,121
and,

3102
01:20:00,121 --> 01:20:02,720
and we just did that fight
in Wembley and they were,

3103
01:20:02,830 --> 01:20:04,390
they thought that the dummy was there.

3104
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:05,270
I was like,

3105
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:06,310
you wouldn't fucking be there.

3106
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:07,150
It,

3107
01:20:07,150 --> 01:20:08,160
he was fucking there.

3108
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,120
It was him.

3109
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:09,660
I would be,

3110
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:10,860
I believe he'd be there.

3111
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:11,160
Yeah,

3112
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:11,581
I got it,

3113
01:20:11,581 --> 01:20:11,870
man.

3114
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:15,210
That was that Vadim Finkelstein for
people that you call him the dummy.

3115
01:20:15,211 --> 01:20:16,410
People don't know what
you're talking about.

3116
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:17,011
The average,

3117
01:20:17,011 --> 01:20:17,700
sorry.

3118
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:21,540
The Dean Finkelstein is
the manager of fuel door.

3119
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:22,620
Emilia [inaudible],

3120
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:23,371
who was a,

3121
01:20:23,371 --> 01:20:24,480
at one point in time,

3122
01:20:24,481 --> 01:20:24,841
the,

3123
01:20:24,841 --> 01:20:25,610
the,

3124
01:20:25,610 --> 01:20:27,060
the pride champion and,

3125
01:20:27,061 --> 01:20:27,400
uh,

3126
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,280
that you guys went through a long,

3127
01:20:29,281 --> 01:20:34,281
lengthy debate or rather a negotiation
with them trying to bring feta or over,

3128
01:20:34,441 --> 01:20:35,350
but it never happened.

3129
01:20:35,351 --> 01:20:37,530
And then that's too bad.

3130
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:38,341
That's too bad.

3131
01:20:38,341 --> 01:20:39,390
That guy never came over.

3132
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:40,650
He just,

3133
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:42,300
he's another guy that was uh,

3134
01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:43,860
was great during his time,

3135
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:47,880
but you can only run that shit for so
long and then you can only run that game

3136
01:20:47,881 --> 01:20:48,714
for so long.

3137
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:52,110
After a while your body just
doesn't want to do it anymore.

3138
01:20:52,111 --> 01:20:53,520
You don't have the motivation anymore.

3139
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,790
He turned to religion then
and then you know for doom,

3140
01:20:56,791 --> 01:20:58,320
big foot Henderson,

3141
01:20:58,650 --> 01:21:00,420
three losses in a row like that.

3142
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:00,841
It's like,

3143
01:21:00,841 --> 01:21:04,830
but still they would have been so fun
to have that guy come over to the UFC.

3144
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:05,783
Tried man.

3145
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:07,170
I know he did try hard.

3146
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:08,131
But when,

3147
01:21:08,131 --> 01:21:09,860
when people hear about like,

3148
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:10,531
like people are like,

3149
01:21:10,531 --> 01:21:12,470
what does he make a deal bring Fado of?

3150
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:14,940
When you hear about the deal though,

3151
01:21:14,941 --> 01:21:17,520
it's like they were doing some crazy shit.

3152
01:21:17,521 --> 01:21:20,480
Like they were trying to get
cope promotion and they wanted,

3153
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:22,920
I mean that's how they got m
one global on the showtime,

3154
01:21:22,921 --> 01:21:23,120
right?

3155
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,830
I mean he's all like
muscling a man with a door.

3156
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:27,510
Do they do fights anymore?

3157
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:29,000
I don't know.

3158
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,490
I mean like a showtime
deal after Fado has done.

3159
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:32,911
Yeah,

3160
01:21:32,911 --> 01:21:33,830
he did have a show time.

3161
01:21:33,831 --> 01:21:33,961
Do you?

3162
01:21:33,961 --> 01:21:36,590
I don't think showtimes screwing
around with them and man,

3163
01:21:36,591 --> 01:21:38,190
I think they done money on Floyd.

3164
01:21:38,610 --> 01:21:38,761
Oh,

3165
01:21:38,761 --> 01:21:39,181
that's right.

3166
01:21:39,181 --> 01:21:40,660
They spend a lot of money
on Floyd Mayweather.

3167
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:41,100
Right.

3168
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:42,120
If that's a good move.

3169
01:21:42,210 --> 01:21:43,043
Yeah,

3170
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:43,690
he's still got,

3171
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:44,010
he's gonna,

3172
01:21:44,010 --> 01:21:45,090
they're gonna Fight Guerrero.

3173
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:45,421
No,

3174
01:21:45,421 --> 01:21:46,200
I agree.

3175
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:46,620
You know,

3176
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:47,910
I think that it was a,

3177
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:48,310
it was a,

3178
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:49,780
it was a strong move by showtime man.

3179
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:51,451
Two great moves.

3180
01:21:51,451 --> 01:21:52,010
Especially it's,

3181
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:53,240
they don't know what the
fuck they're doing with them.

3182
01:21:53,390 --> 01:21:53,810
And Man,

3183
01:21:53,810 --> 01:21:54,990
I can get out of the business.

3184
01:21:55,830 --> 01:21:58,440
It's fascinating to watch
people try to get into it.

3185
01:21:58,441 --> 01:22:02,780
Like apparently that dude in India is
hemorrhaging cash at the Super Fight

3186
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:02,920
League thing.

3187
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:03,753
Worse.

3188
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:04,241
Always look.

3189
01:22:04,241 --> 01:22:06,570
So Ken Pavio doing the
post fight interview.

3190
01:22:06,571 --> 01:22:07,920
He goes and does he really?

3191
01:22:07,921 --> 01:22:09,180
Oh my God,

3192
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:11,400
that guy is such a fucking tool.

3193
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:11,791
But you know,

3194
01:22:11,791 --> 01:22:14,610
but I think baroni me was
invicta or I think it was,

3195
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:16,100
or maybe it was super tightly bro.

3196
01:22:16,110 --> 01:22:16,681
And he did some,

3197
01:22:16,681 --> 01:22:17,431
a commentary.

3198
01:22:17,431 --> 01:22:18,960
He's fucking hilarious.

3199
01:22:19,090 --> 01:22:19,770
He is funny.

3200
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:22,170
His commentary is fucking like Peroni,

3201
01:22:22,171 --> 01:22:22,470
man.

3202
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:23,910
I've always had a good relationship.

3203
01:22:23,911 --> 01:22:24,450
A Peroni,

3204
01:22:24,450 --> 01:22:28,410
one of the best commentary times I've
ever did was in Miami with Ronnie.

3205
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:29,010
I mean,

3206
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:31,260
let me tell you when I
say I've tried it all,

3207
01:22:31,261 --> 01:22:32,400
I fucking try it at all.

3208
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:33,240
I really am.

3209
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:33,361
Well,

3210
01:22:33,361 --> 01:22:35,970
that was a disaster because
I had to do goal these job,

3211
01:22:35,971 --> 01:22:37,170
but I don't know how to do that job.

3212
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,980
I remember that I was freaked out like,

3213
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:41,101
you know why?

3214
01:22:41,101 --> 01:22:43,380
Because they were talking to me like
I knew what the fuck they were saying.

3215
01:22:43,670 --> 01:22:46,800
Like they don't understand like
how loose doing commentary is.

3216
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:49,070
Nothing can happen that I,

3217
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:49,800
I,

3218
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,960
I can't talk about something
that's not happening.

3219
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:52,261
Right.

3220
01:22:52,261 --> 01:22:52,711
Okay.

3221
01:22:52,711 --> 01:22:54,540
And it has to happen
for me to talk about it.

3222
01:22:54,541 --> 01:22:56,010
So it's pretty fucking easy for me.

3223
01:22:56,050 --> 01:22:56,200
I'm,

3224
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,730
I'll have to do is be aware
and know what's going on.

3225
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:01,290
Know who the fighters are with the
strength of the weakest says ready go.

3226
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:02,340
What gold he has to do.

3227
01:23:02,341 --> 01:23:02,521
All right.

3228
01:23:02,521 --> 01:23:02,971
We're gonna roll.

3229
01:23:02,971 --> 01:23:05,010
And he was more of a traffic
cop to open the five,

3230
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:06,220
a two with a wide shot.

3231
01:23:06,221 --> 01:23:07,060
We'll come and do a two shot.

3232
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:07,511
I go,

3233
01:23:07,511 --> 01:23:09,130
what the fuck are you saying?

3234
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:09,540
I go,

3235
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:10,780
is this written down somewhere?

3236
01:23:10,810 --> 01:23:11,680
You want me to read this?

3237
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:12,460
And then you're like,

3238
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:12,731
oh,

3239
01:23:12,731 --> 01:23:13,564
Jesus.

3240
01:23:13,590 --> 01:23:15,550
Like they thought like
maybe I'd done it before.

3241
01:23:15,551 --> 01:23:15,851
I was like,

3242
01:23:15,851 --> 01:23:16,001
no,

3243
01:23:16,001 --> 01:23:17,110
I've never done any of this before.

3244
01:23:17,111 --> 01:23:17,350
I don't know.

3245
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:18,370
I don't know what you're talking about.

3246
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:19,780
Not a described shit.

3247
01:23:20,430 --> 01:23:21,930
Freaking the fuck out that night.

3248
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:22,690
I don't remember that.

3249
01:23:22,690 --> 01:23:23,900
But it worked with Barone.

3250
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:24,920
It worked with Brody.

3251
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:25,660
That was a,

3252
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:25,901
yeah,

3253
01:23:25,901 --> 01:23:27,160
you really have tried everything.

3254
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:27,761
I have,

3255
01:23:27,761 --> 01:23:28,270
man.

3256
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:31,270
It's fun to be a part of this man to
be a part of it from the beginning like

3257
01:23:31,271 --> 01:23:31,740
that too.

3258
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:32,860
It's like the old days,

3259
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:33,641
you see very,

3260
01:23:33,641 --> 01:23:35,650
very beginning to see what it's like now.

3261
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:35,981
It's a,

3262
01:23:35,981 --> 01:23:37,000
it's a strange shit.

3263
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:40,240
I did an interview today where it's
talking about like the difference between

3264
01:23:40,241 --> 01:23:40,601
Dothan,

3265
01:23:40,601 --> 01:23:42,340
Alabama and the Roger Center.

3266
01:23:42,610 --> 01:23:43,840
That was probably when I,

3267
01:23:43,930 --> 01:23:44,531
when I was like,

3268
01:23:44,531 --> 01:23:44,801
really?

3269
01:23:44,801 --> 01:23:46,210
It was like whoa.

3270
01:23:46,450 --> 01:23:46,721
You know,

3271
01:23:46,721 --> 01:23:51,310
look around and the giant 80 foot
screen of Leo Machida jumping front,

3272
01:23:51,311 --> 01:23:52,540
kicking Randy in the face.

3273
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:54,610
I remember just seeing
that over and over again.

3274
01:23:54,611 --> 01:23:58,240
This boom that that kick when Randy
would go down and I'm always like,

3275
01:23:58,241 --> 01:24:00,280
this is then Nadia Shit
I've ever seen in my life.

3276
01:24:00,281 --> 01:24:01,570
This 60,000 fucking,

3277
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:05,800
it's so cool to be able to go to all these
different arenas around the world and

3278
01:24:06,430 --> 01:24:09,280
and meet all these different fans
from all these different countries.

3279
01:24:09,281 --> 01:24:10,750
Like when I was in Ireland,

3280
01:24:10,751 --> 01:24:12,010
the fucking people are so cool.

3281
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:12,461
England,

3282
01:24:12,461 --> 01:24:13,330
the people are so cool.

3283
01:24:13,331 --> 01:24:14,530
You go to Sweden,

3284
01:24:14,531 --> 01:24:16,090
it's going to be fucking awesome again.

3285
01:24:16,091 --> 01:24:16,301
You know,

3286
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:17,890
we're going back to Japan next week.

3287
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:18,853
It's just like,

3288
01:24:19,390 --> 01:24:21,160
there's just so many fucking cool people.

3289
01:24:21,161 --> 01:24:22,620
That last time we went to Japan,

3290
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:23,920
the fans were just insane.

3291
01:24:23,921 --> 01:24:24,340
It was.

3292
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:25,121
It was amazing.

3293
01:24:25,121 --> 01:24:26,650
It's just so cool to be a part of it.

3294
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:26,920
Yeah.

3295
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:28,390
Brian came in Japan.

3296
01:24:28,450 --> 01:24:28,991
That was fun.

3297
01:24:28,991 --> 01:24:29,171
You know?

3298
01:24:29,171 --> 01:24:30,160
Are you going to Japan next?

3299
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:30,580
No,

3300
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:30,881
no,

3301
01:24:30,881 --> 01:24:32,080
I don't do,

3302
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,033
it's a fuel fight.

3303
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:33,311
Yeah.

3304
01:24:33,311 --> 01:24:35,010
I don't do the fuel ones or the FX.

3305
01:24:35,011 --> 01:24:35,250
Why?

3306
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:36,220
And even while Japan,

3307
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:36,810
I think about it all.

3308
01:24:36,810 --> 01:24:37,510
It was fun.

3309
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:37,721
Yeah,

3310
01:24:37,721 --> 01:24:38,560
we had a good time there.

3311
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:41,680
It was a fascinating little country.

3312
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:45,680
And it's cool to the point where now
we're so many fans from let's say,

3313
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:46,120
let's say we,

3314
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:46,401
you know,

3315
01:24:46,401 --> 01:24:47,750
obviously went to fights in America.

3316
01:24:47,751 --> 01:24:48,830
People come from all over the world,

3317
01:24:48,831 --> 01:24:50,540
but now people from America
and all over the world,

3318
01:24:50,541 --> 01:24:51,440
they're going to pump fights.

3319
01:24:51,441 --> 01:24:51,920
And,

3320
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:52,430
you know,

3321
01:24:52,430 --> 01:24:53,241
when we were in,

3322
01:24:53,241 --> 01:24:54,060
um,

3323
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:54,700
uh,

3324
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:55,520
only just an England,

3325
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:56,353
so many,

3326
01:24:56,540 --> 01:24:57,373
so many

3327
01:24:58,700 --> 01:24:59,380
Brazilians,

3328
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:01,040
they're really cool.

3329
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:01,740
You know,

3330
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:02,600
it's like,

3331
01:25:02,650 --> 01:25:03,150
how about,

3332
01:25:03,150 --> 01:25:06,650
how about this fucking broke
the gate record at Wembley.

3333
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:07,430
Really?

3334
01:25:07,430 --> 01:25:08,150
Yeah.

3335
01:25:08,150 --> 01:25:08,660
Wow.

3336
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:11,480
Henry Cooper fought Floyd Patterson there.

3337
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:12,710
Um,

3338
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:14,060
Henry Cooper fought somebody else there.

3339
01:25:14,061 --> 01:25:14,810
I can't remember who.

3340
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:15,740
Did he fight Ali there?

3341
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:16,071
Uh,

3342
01:25:16,071 --> 01:25:16,880
no.

3343
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:17,420
Um,

3344
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:17,900
and then,

3345
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:18,733
uh,

3346
01:25:19,070 --> 01:25:19,820
what's his name?

3347
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:20,653
Fought there.

3348
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:21,593
Uh,

3349
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:24,620
Lennox Lewis fought all
of them will call there.

3350
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:26,690
Lennox Lewis plot the Britain,

3351
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:28,850
a European champ there.

3352
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:29,990
And we beat every,

3353
01:25:29,991 --> 01:25:32,570
we beat every sports related
event that's ever been to Wembley.

3354
01:25:32,750 --> 01:25:33,390
Wow.

3355
01:25:33,390 --> 01:25:33,970
That cool.

3356
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:34,121
Well,

3357
01:25:34,121 --> 01:25:35,650
MMA is huge in the UK now.

3358
01:25:35,651 --> 01:25:38,440
There's so many gyms coming out of the
UK and there's so many guys that are

3359
01:25:38,441 --> 01:25:39,550
coming out of the UK now.

3360
01:25:39,730 --> 01:25:41,230
He's seen like Jimmy Manawat guy.

3361
01:25:41,231 --> 01:25:41,560
Yeah.

3362
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:43,020
That guy's a fucking beast,

3363
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:43,420
man.

3364
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:45,010
That was a very impressive fight.

3365
01:25:45,011 --> 01:25:49,120
Him and serial deal [inaudible] cause
[inaudible] days of really seasoned

3366
01:25:49,121 --> 01:25:49,954
striker,

3367
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:52,210
multiple time World Moitai champion,

3368
01:25:52,211 --> 01:25:52,451
you know?

3369
01:25:52,451 --> 01:25:53,740
And he was excited for that fight.

3370
01:25:53,741 --> 01:25:54,101
It's sucked.

3371
01:25:54,101 --> 01:25:55,000
His leg got fucked up.

3372
01:25:55,090 --> 01:25:56,260
I was so excited for that.

3373
01:25:56,290 --> 01:25:56,711
It's tucked,

3374
01:25:56,711 --> 01:25:57,670
his leg got fucked up.

3375
01:25:57,671 --> 01:26:00,310
But I was really impressed with
Amanda what was doing before.

3376
01:26:00,311 --> 01:26:01,390
It's like I fucked up.

3377
01:26:01,391 --> 01:26:01,751
I was like,

3378
01:26:01,751 --> 01:26:02,021
wow,

3379
01:26:02,021 --> 01:26:03,160
this kid is a beast,

3380
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:03,650
right?

3381
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:03,831
Yeah.

3382
01:26:03,831 --> 01:26:04,070
He's

3383
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:04,251
a,

3384
01:26:04,251 --> 01:26:05,780
he's a very aggressive guy.

3385
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:07,330
Very a very dangerous guy.

3386
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:07,700
Yeah.

3387
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:08,533
It's going to be fun.

3388
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:09,520
Just go,

3389
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:09,850
you know,

3390
01:26:09,850 --> 01:26:10,683
you're right at home.

3391
01:26:10,710 --> 01:26:12,530
You got a guy that's got that kind of,

3392
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:13,490
you know,

3393
01:26:13,490 --> 01:26:13,940
how,

3394
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:17,060
how's his ground game going to be when
he gets up against the real good wrestler

3395
01:26:17,061 --> 01:26:17,770
and crown guy.

3396
01:26:17,770 --> 01:26:18,260
Well,

3397
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:18,621
yeah,

3398
01:26:18,621 --> 01:26:19,520
I mean that is a,

3399
01:26:19,521 --> 01:26:20,870
that is always the question.

3400
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:21,290
There's,

3401
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:22,220
there's those guys,

3402
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:22,701
you know,

3403
01:26:22,701 --> 01:26:24,650
like that's the big
question about John Fitch.

3404
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:25,491
Like a lot of people say,

3405
01:26:25,491 --> 01:26:25,731
oh,

3406
01:26:25,731 --> 01:26:26,690
John Fitch is boring.

3407
01:26:26,691 --> 01:26:27,140
John fidgets,

3408
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:27,330
boy.

3409
01:26:27,330 --> 01:26:27,980
I'm like,

3410
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:31,470
Jon Finch is a reality and you
gotta be able to deal with a guy.

3411
01:26:31,471 --> 01:26:32,120
Like I said,

3412
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:34,240
I think it's a,

3413
01:26:34,430 --> 01:26:38,540
it's an important aspect of
fighting that a guy made the deal,

3414
01:26:38,541 --> 01:26:39,021
the fight.

3415
01:26:39,021 --> 01:26:39,650
So exciting.

3416
01:26:39,650 --> 01:26:40,410
Yeah,

3417
01:26:40,410 --> 01:26:40,760
yeah,

3418
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:41,240
yeah,

3419
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:41,740
yeah.

3420
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:42,230
That,

3421
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:42,561
I mean,

3422
01:26:42,561 --> 01:26:45,830
John Ground that kid down
to a halt and Eric Silvers,

3423
01:26:45,831 --> 01:26:46,580
I was scary.

3424
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:47,780
Fuck that kid.

3425
01:26:47,781 --> 01:26:48,381
Scary.

3426
01:26:48,381 --> 01:26:48,981
He's a very,

3427
01:26:48,981 --> 01:26:51,320
very dangerous for explosive,

3428
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:53,780
real dangerous with his
knees and his striking,

3429
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,840
he finished his fights very
quickly that Carlo prayed or fight.

3430
01:26:56,841 --> 01:26:57,320
I mean,

3431
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:58,580
he's a dangerous kid.

3432
01:26:58,700 --> 01:26:59,810
The fight with um,

3433
01:26:59,820 --> 01:27:00,140
uh,

3434
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:01,330
the Spaniard,

3435
01:27:01,370 --> 01:27:02,203
Charlie Brenneman,

3436
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:03,290
he's a dangerous,

3437
01:27:03,291 --> 01:27:04,610
dangerous kid and man,

3438
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:05,960
Fitch was able to glue on them.

3439
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:09,500
What was crazy was watching
Damien Maia outfit Fitch,

3440
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:10,070
right?

3441
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:13,470
Like how good is that guy
when you see that guy?

3442
01:27:13,471 --> 01:27:16,580
I got ahold of Fitch and just completely
controlled and when it came to

3443
01:27:16,581 --> 01:27:17,450
grappling I was like,

3444
01:27:17,510 --> 01:27:19,580
but the big kink in his
arm wrestle standoff.

3445
01:27:19,581 --> 01:27:19,941
He goes,

3446
01:27:19,941 --> 01:27:20,810
Amiens the guy like,

3447
01:27:20,811 --> 01:27:21,644
yeah,

3448
01:27:21,890 --> 01:27:22,340
who can,

3449
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:23,540
who can stop the take down?

3450
01:27:23,541 --> 01:27:24,830
And man at once,

3451
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:26,540
heaven named me and mine is a beast.

3452
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:27,650
He's a,

3453
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:28,100
I mean,

3454
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:29,740
he is always going to
have a problem with it.

3455
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:29,870
Well,

3456
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:30,081
you know,

3457
01:27:30,081 --> 01:27:30,910
he's gonna have a problem with it.

3458
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:32,750
More cart has to be an
interesting rematch.

3459
01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:35,290
Everyone 70 that's a
very interesting rematch.

3460
01:27:35,291 --> 01:27:38,220
So matter of fact at one 70 and
a good fight from our court,

3461
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:39,620
what do you got from our court now though?

3462
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:41,640
Don't you have a Ellenberger yeah,

3463
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:45,800
and condit versus uh,

3464
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:47,090
uh,

3465
01:27:47,090 --> 01:27:48,530
Hendrick's Hendrick's Johny Hendricks.

3466
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:49,550
Oh my God,

3467
01:27:49,551 --> 01:27:50,151
I love that.

3468
01:27:50,151 --> 01:27:50,890
It's a great card.

3469
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:55,820
I it sucks it Rory Diaz versus Georgia
and tis versus George of course.

3470
01:27:55,821 --> 01:27:58,280
But it sucks at Rory got
hurt that that does suck.

3471
01:27:58,670 --> 01:27:59,630
That kid's scary.

3472
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:01,400
That fight with Bj Penn was like,

3473
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:01,970
man,

3474
01:28:01,970 --> 01:28:02,600
he,

3475
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:06,950
he's one of those kids where you don't
see him for like five or six months and

3476
01:28:06,951 --> 01:28:07,790
then all of a sudden you're like,

3477
01:28:07,791 --> 01:28:08,630
Holy Shit,

3478
01:28:08,631 --> 01:28:10,550
this kid just got 50% better.

3479
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:13,130
Like the combinations he
was throwing against Bj,

3480
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:15,440
his standup look 50% better,

3481
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:18,890
completely smooth robotic almost.

3482
01:28:18,891 --> 01:28:19,970
And it's precision.

3483
01:28:20,180 --> 01:28:23,180
He was throwing that question
mark kick over and over again,

3484
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:24,980
throwing combinations to the body.

3485
01:28:25,070 --> 01:28:25,821
And then what does it,

3486
01:28:25,821 --> 01:28:28,160
the second round we were
really had Bj fucked up.

3487
01:28:28,161 --> 01:28:28,730
I was like,

3488
01:28:28,730 --> 01:28:31,790
this is the biggest beating
I think Bj has ever taken.

3489
01:28:31,791 --> 01:28:34,280
No doubt about Bj took a
beating with Nick Diaz,

3490
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,680
but it was more of a prolonged bing,

3491
01:28:36,681 --> 01:28:37,011
bing,

3492
01:28:37,011 --> 01:28:37,281
bing,

3493
01:28:37,281 --> 01:28:42,281
bing that there's like a 45 second like
burst in the second round where he just

3494
01:28:43,431 --> 01:28:44,640
beats the shit ass.

3495
01:28:44,690 --> 01:28:46,830
That's why I don't want
Bj to fight any more man.

3496
01:28:47,230 --> 01:28:51,110
The George Saint Pierre beating the
Rory beating the nick is beating.

3497
01:28:51,380 --> 01:28:54,020
I mean what are those three
fights have in common?

3498
01:28:54,021 --> 01:28:55,370
170 fucking pounds.

3499
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:57,590
Why is that guy fighting at 170 pounds?

3500
01:28:57,740 --> 01:29:02,700
You go back to the Bj Penn that fought
against Diego at one 55 when the

3501
01:29:02,701 --> 01:29:03,301
Marinovich is,

3502
01:29:03,301 --> 01:29:05,370
we're training them and
he was a fucking savage.

3503
01:29:05,490 --> 01:29:06,241
He was ripped.

3504
01:29:06,241 --> 01:29:07,470
He had a full six pack.

3505
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:10,410
I mean Bj was super
conditioned in that fight

3506
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:14,450
because the problem with Bj
Penn is he's a fucking warrior.

3507
01:29:14,510 --> 01:29:15,440
He's a maniac.

3508
01:29:15,441 --> 01:29:16,370
You don't give a fuck.

3509
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:20,090
This kid went to this kid fought
Leo Machida for Christ Sakes,

3510
01:29:20,890 --> 01:29:21,440
heavyweight.

3511
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:22,850
I'm not even at two oh five.

3512
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:23,211
You know,

3513
01:29:23,211 --> 01:29:28,010
Bj is just incredibly talented freak who,

3514
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:28,660
you know,

3515
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:28,881
had,

3516
01:29:28,881 --> 01:29:29,714
he worked hard,

3517
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:30,351
you know,

3518
01:29:30,351 --> 01:29:31,610
really got into it and done,

3519
01:29:31,910 --> 01:29:32,530
you know,

3520
01:29:32,530 --> 01:29:32,760
what,

3521
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:33,590
what he could have done.

3522
01:29:33,590 --> 01:29:34,280
Who knows?

3523
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:35,480
Sky's the limit for him.

3524
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:36,831
But you know,

3525
01:29:36,831 --> 01:29:38,330
he cruised on natural ability,

3526
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:40,340
heart and fucking huge balls.

3527
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:41,790
And you know,

3528
01:29:41,810 --> 01:29:42,350
I just,

3529
01:29:42,350 --> 01:29:44,090
the thing is I've had my,

3530
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:45,320
my beefs,

3531
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:46,520
Lbj and the family,

3532
01:29:46,850 --> 01:29:49,130
but I really love and
respect the kid very much.

3533
01:29:49,131 --> 01:29:49,964
And uh,

3534
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:50,320
I don't,

3535
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:50,781
I just,

3536
01:29:50,781 --> 01:29:51,260
I don't,

3537
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:52,260
I don't want to see him fight anymore.

3538
01:29:52,490 --> 01:29:53,500
He was an amazing fighter.

3539
01:29:53,501 --> 01:29:54,190
But again,

3540
01:29:54,190 --> 01:29:55,023
I don't think,

3541
01:29:55,510 --> 01:30:00,510
I think fighting is such
an insane proposition that
it can only be done at the

3542
01:30:00,731 --> 01:30:02,680
highest levels for a few years.

3543
01:30:02,860 --> 01:30:03,730
You can only do it.

3544
01:30:03,850 --> 01:30:04,541
Somebody had a,

3545
01:30:04,541 --> 01:30:05,020
um,

3546
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:08,110
a thing that they wrote online
about great fighters at a,

3547
01:30:08,111 --> 01:30:12,040
at the nine year point of their career
and that had all these great fighters

3548
01:30:12,041 --> 01:30:14,320
that were competing at a high
level for like nine years,

3549
01:30:14,321 --> 01:30:16,840
at about nine years to
start to see a waning and,

3550
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:17,260
uh,

3551
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:20,020
an erosion of the skills
that it's almost like,

3552
01:30:20,530 --> 01:30:23,410
it's almost like you got
to know when to walk away.

3553
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:25,880
Age is what kills all great athletes.

3554
01:30:25,881 --> 01:30:27,740
You know what's going
to beat Anderson Silva?

3555
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:28,270
Yeah.

3556
01:30:28,270 --> 01:30:29,380
H is going to beat him.

3557
01:30:29,381 --> 01:30:30,214
That's what's going to beat him.

3558
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:31,333
Um,

3559
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:32,360
especially right now,

3560
01:30:32,361 --> 01:30:34,910
he's just in his freaking perfect prime.

3561
01:30:34,940 --> 01:30:37,010
Bj Penn has nothing to prove anymore.

3562
01:30:37,310 --> 01:30:38,630
The guys got a bunch of money.

3563
01:30:38,631 --> 01:30:39,860
He's got a beautiful wife.

3564
01:30:39,861 --> 01:30:40,790
He's got kids.

3565
01:30:41,150 --> 01:30:42,260
Just fuck it,

3566
01:30:42,261 --> 01:30:42,471
man.

3567
01:30:42,471 --> 01:30:42,581
You,

3568
01:30:42,581 --> 01:30:43,670
you had your time and,

3569
01:30:43,671 --> 01:30:44,001
and you,

3570
01:30:44,001 --> 01:30:44,834
uh,

3571
01:30:44,890 --> 01:30:45,351
I just,

3572
01:30:45,351 --> 01:30:45,920
you know,

3573
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:46,401
again,

3574
01:30:46,401 --> 01:30:48,050
when people talk about Joe,

3575
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:50,390
I don't give a fuck about money,

3576
01:30:50,391 --> 01:30:50,601
man.

3577
01:30:50,601 --> 01:30:53,000
I really don't give a fuck about money.

3578
01:30:53,150 --> 01:30:55,400
I run a business and you've
got to run a business to,

3579
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:56,723
you know,

3580
01:30:57,020 --> 01:30:59,330
to keep the thing alive and
to keep it going or whatever.

3581
01:30:59,331 --> 01:31:02,630
But I don't ever want to
make that kind of money,

3582
01:31:02,631 --> 01:31:02,841
man.

3583
01:31:02,841 --> 01:31:04,730
I seen Bj Penn fight again.

3584
01:31:05,290 --> 01:31:05,441
Well,

3585
01:31:05,441 --> 01:31:06,850
you don't need to make that kind of money.

3586
01:31:06,851 --> 01:31:07,601
And let's be honest,

3587
01:31:07,601 --> 01:31:08,640
he'd give a fuck about money.

3588
01:31:08,641 --> 01:31:09,341
You're fucking rich.

3589
01:31:09,341 --> 01:31:09,980
What are you talking about?

3590
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:10,450
Killing time,

3591
01:31:10,450 --> 01:31:11,170
man.

3592
01:31:11,170 --> 01:31:11,711
He crazy.

3593
01:31:11,711 --> 01:31:12,910
When you go back to being poor again,

3594
01:31:12,940 --> 01:31:13,531
let me talk to you.

3595
01:31:13,531 --> 01:31:14,100
Oh sorry.

3596
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:15,220
Let me tell you what your side,

3597
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:17,440
but we tell you we'll talk
[inaudible] seen a cell phone,

3598
01:31:17,441 --> 01:31:17,621
John.

3599
01:31:17,621 --> 01:31:18,454
I honestly,

3600
01:31:18,570 --> 01:31:19,270
yeah,

3601
01:31:19,270 --> 01:31:19,990
exactly.

3602
01:31:19,990 --> 01:31:20,823
Actually,

3603
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:22,240
I've also seen as Ferrari.

3604
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:25,653
Listen,

3605
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:27,130
when you got money,

3606
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:28,330
there's no doubt.

3607
01:31:28,330 --> 01:31:31,420
You know the thing I'm telling you,

3608
01:31:31,990 --> 01:31:33,250
I know what you're telling me all day.

3609
01:31:33,251 --> 01:31:34,210
I know what you're saying.

3610
01:31:34,270 --> 01:31:35,440
This is fucking happy.

3611
01:31:35,441 --> 01:31:36,274
When I was broke,

3612
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:37,540
I love what I do.

3613
01:31:37,541 --> 01:31:38,380
I love the sport

3614
01:31:38,980 --> 01:31:39,491
and I just,

3615
01:31:39,491 --> 01:31:39,631
I,

3616
01:31:39,631 --> 01:31:39,970
I,

3617
01:31:39,970 --> 01:31:40,803
I,

3618
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:41,431
I'm telling you,

3619
01:31:41,431 --> 01:31:42,490
I really don't give a fuck.

3620
01:31:42,710 --> 01:31:43,070
Well,

3621
01:31:43,070 --> 01:31:47,000
what you don't want is that kind of
money from having a guy like Bj fight.

3622
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:47,290
Don't,

3623
01:31:47,290 --> 01:31:48,830
haven't chucked fight and again,

3624
01:31:48,831 --> 01:31:49,430
or having,

3625
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:49,581
well,

3626
01:31:49,581 --> 01:31:50,810
you can make money on those guys.

3627
01:31:50,811 --> 01:31:51,650
And by the way,

3628
01:31:51,651 --> 01:31:53,930
I'm sure chuck probably came to you
and said he wants a fight again,

3629
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:54,351
I'm sure.

3630
01:31:54,351 --> 01:31:55,184
Yes,

3631
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:55,940
no,

3632
01:31:55,940 --> 01:31:56,421
after we,

3633
01:31:56,421 --> 01:31:57,800
after we established

3634
01:31:58,590 --> 01:32:00,160
that pat that it was over

3635
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:00,491
and he,

3636
01:32:00,491 --> 01:32:00,970
he,

3637
01:32:00,970 --> 01:32:01,803
uh,

3638
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:04,710
he admitted to it and agreed
to the rich Franklin fight,

3639
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:05,590
he never did it again.

3640
01:32:05,591 --> 01:32:05,711
Yeah.

3641
01:32:05,711 --> 01:32:06,480
He never asked me.

3642
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:06,621
Well,

3643
01:32:06,621 --> 01:32:07,454
that's great.

3644
01:32:07,530 --> 01:32:07,711
Well,

3645
01:32:07,711 --> 01:32:08,251
that's smart.

3646
01:32:08,251 --> 01:32:09,040
That's intelligent.

3647
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:09,600
You know,

3648
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,433
there's a certain,

3649
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:13,130
you mean you watched a shot that put
them away and the rich Franklin fight,

3650
01:32:13,131 --> 01:32:15,180
you go chocolate eat and 50 of those and,

3651
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:16,770
and smiled right at.

3652
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:17,310
Yeah.

3653
01:32:17,310 --> 01:32:18,101
In 19,

3654
01:32:18,101 --> 01:32:18,420
you know,

3655
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:19,820
99 or 2000

3656
01:32:20,510 --> 01:32:22,010
vicious knock outs at
the end of his career.

3657
01:32:22,011 --> 01:32:22,470
The,

3658
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:24,590
the Rashad Evans Scout was vicious.

3659
01:32:24,810 --> 01:32:25,430
Uh,

3660
01:32:25,430 --> 01:32:27,410
rampage knockout was vicious,

3661
01:32:27,411 --> 01:32:27,671
you know,

3662
01:32:27,671 --> 01:32:28,504
just,

3663
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:29,260
yeah.

3664
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:31,560
Shogun to keep doing that as just fucking

3665
01:32:31,650 --> 01:32:33,590
shogun rich Franklin and,

3666
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:34,490
and Keith Strawn,

3667
01:32:34,490 --> 01:32:36,150
Jean dropped him hard to cheat,

3668
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:36,993
starting hurt him.

3669
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:38,280
He hit him with a big punch,

3670
01:32:38,670 --> 01:32:38,971
you know,

3671
01:32:38,971 --> 01:32:39,541
and that was,

3672
01:32:39,541 --> 01:32:40,320
uh,

3673
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:40,621
yeah,

3674
01:32:40,621 --> 01:32:40,951
there's,

3675
01:32:40,951 --> 01:32:44,490
there's been a lot of like really crazy
fights and he'd go back to the fucking

3676
01:32:44,491 --> 01:32:46,980
Paly Fuck Paly bare knuckles in Brazil.

3677
01:32:47,370 --> 01:32:47,611
You know,

3678
01:32:47,611 --> 01:32:51,090
whether there's a net on the bottom of
the rank to keep guys from scooting out

3679
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:54,050
and chuck stuffed Paleo a nap,

3680
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:56,670
reaching over the back of the
net and punched him in the head.

3681
01:32:56,671 --> 01:32:58,850
There was virtually no rules back then.

3682
01:32:58,851 --> 01:32:58,980
Yeah,

3683
01:32:58,980 --> 01:32:59,940
he fought all those.

3684
01:32:59,941 --> 01:33:00,900
That was crazy.

3685
01:33:00,990 --> 01:33:02,640
I was there if they didn't
have gloves on either.

3686
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:03,481
Yeah,

3687
01:33:03,481 --> 01:33:04,140
they didn't have gloves.

3688
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:05,360
Was bare knuckle nothing.

3689
01:33:05,370 --> 01:33:06,000
Bare knuckle.

3690
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:06,833
Yeah.

3691
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:07,720
Chuck's uh,

3692
01:33:07,820 --> 01:33:09,540
I don't know if Chuck's
first fight in the UFC.

3693
01:33:09,541 --> 01:33:10,560
I think they had gloves,

3694
01:33:10,561 --> 01:33:12,720
but it was like when they were
just starting to use gloves.

3695
01:33:12,990 --> 01:33:13,171
He,

3696
01:33:13,171 --> 01:33:14,004
when he fought,

3697
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:14,853
um,

3698
01:33:17,010 --> 01:33:17,910
boxer kid,

3699
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:18,930
I forget the kid's name.

3700
01:33:19,770 --> 01:33:20,610
Ramirez.

3701
01:33:20,650 --> 01:33:21,030
Um,

3702
01:33:21,030 --> 01:33:21,960
I don't remember his name.

3703
01:33:22,050 --> 01:33:23,370
Martinez and Maria Martinez.

3704
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:24,953
Noe Hernandez.

3705
01:33:25,070 --> 01:33:25,531
Hernandez.

3706
01:33:25,531 --> 01:33:26,364
Thank you very much.

3707
01:33:26,490 --> 01:33:26,731
Yeah.

3708
01:33:26,731 --> 01:33:26,931
No,

3709
01:33:26,931 --> 01:33:27,481
he Hernandez.

3710
01:33:27,481 --> 01:33:28,051
That was when,

3711
01:33:28,051 --> 01:33:28,884
uh,

3712
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:29,700
and I don't,

3713
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:33,600
I would like to get Peretti on the podcast
when putted Peretti sent me a tweet

3714
01:33:33,601 --> 01:33:34,080
saying,

3715
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,820
how come you never a want me on your show?

3716
01:33:35,821 --> 01:33:37,230
We had such respect for you when we,

3717
01:33:37,231 --> 01:33:39,570
when we hired you for the company,

3718
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:40,650
but you'd never have me on your show.

3719
01:33:40,651 --> 01:33:40,861
I'm like,

3720
01:33:40,861 --> 01:33:41,671
what are you talking about?

3721
01:33:41,671 --> 01:33:43,080
I'll have you on any day of the week.

3722
01:33:43,470 --> 01:33:43,741
I go,

3723
01:33:43,741 --> 01:33:44,760
tell me when you want to come on.

3724
01:33:44,761 --> 01:33:46,140
And then I never heard from him again.

3725
01:33:46,350 --> 01:33:46,920
All right.

3726
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:47,671
I don't know why.

3727
01:33:47,671 --> 01:33:48,421
I don't know what happened,

3728
01:33:48,421 --> 01:33:49,710
but I did have that guy in a heartbeat.

3729
01:33:49,890 --> 01:33:51,210
He's a fascinating character,

3730
01:33:51,570 --> 01:33:53,660
but he told chuck that chuck had a,

3731
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:54,211
he goes,

3732
01:33:54,211 --> 01:33:54,420
uh,

3733
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:56,970
he found out the chuck was a wrestler
and I had chuck talk about it on the

3734
01:33:56,971 --> 01:33:58,430
podcast and he told me,

3735
01:33:58,740 --> 01:34:00,060
he told me when I managed chuck,

3736
01:34:00,210 --> 01:34:00,910
what

3737
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:01,940
the Mohawks played out.

3738
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:03,050
No,

3739
01:34:03,050 --> 01:34:04,030
nobody wants to see them a lot.

3740
01:34:04,350 --> 01:34:05,470
They're not bringing him back.

3741
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:06,611
I said,

3742
01:34:06,611 --> 01:34:08,620
you're not bringing them back
because it was fucking Mohawk.

3743
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:10,720
It was the craziest thing I've ever heard.

3744
01:34:12,370 --> 01:34:13,220
So we,

3745
01:34:13,221 --> 01:34:13,470
we,

3746
01:34:13,470 --> 01:34:13,990
we ended up,

3747
01:34:13,990 --> 01:34:15,100
I ended up getting him a fight.

3748
01:34:15,490 --> 01:34:15,970
He fought,

3749
01:34:15,970 --> 01:34:16,803
ah,

3750
01:34:16,850 --> 01:34:18,040
fuck was that guy's name.

3751
01:34:18,041 --> 01:34:19,030
He knocked him out.

3752
01:34:19,690 --> 01:34:22,390
He was the IFC champion at the time.

3753
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:23,771
And,

3754
01:34:23,771 --> 01:34:23,950
uh,

3755
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:24,990
Steve something,

3756
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:26,021
remember him?

3757
01:34:26,021 --> 01:34:27,940
Steve IFC champion,

3758
01:34:27,970 --> 01:34:29,300
who's the IFC champion.

3759
01:34:29,301 --> 01:34:30,134
Steve something.

3760
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:33,190
Chuck knocked him out and uh,

3761
01:34:33,430 --> 01:34:34,960
and that kind of back into the UFC.

3762
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:36,320
Oh really?

3763
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:36,650
Yeah.

3764
01:34:36,650 --> 01:34:37,910
To have a fight outside of it.

3765
01:34:37,911 --> 01:34:38,780
That's hilarious.

3766
01:34:38,830 --> 01:34:39,400
Yeah.

3767
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:41,660
They sat the UFC sign
chuck for two and two.

3768
01:34:42,930 --> 01:34:47,930
They know when to to show to the
window to MMA in New York right now.

3769
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:50,290
Well,

3770
01:34:50,290 --> 01:34:50,531
you know,

3771
01:34:50,531 --> 01:34:51,364
we've got a question.

3772
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:53,790
We filed this lawsuit and uh,

3773
01:34:53,830 --> 01:34:55,570
we had a really good response.

3774
01:34:56,230 --> 01:34:58,010
Basically the um,

3775
01:34:58,610 --> 01:34:59,450
the uh,

3776
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:00,740
district attorney,

3777
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:02,073
whatever,

3778
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:04,153
could not

3779
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:09,380
tell the judge what the language was and
why it was illegal and all this other

3780
01:35:09,381 --> 01:35:09,621
shit.

3781
01:35:09,621 --> 01:35:11,210
So basically the judge said,

3782
01:35:11,450 --> 01:35:11,960
you know,

3783
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:13,280
we agree this is right.

3784
01:35:13,790 --> 01:35:16,550
They could come in here and just
be sanctioned by a federation,

3785
01:35:17,390 --> 01:35:19,370
like the PKA or the,

3786
01:35:19,371 --> 01:35:20,204
you know what I mean?

3787
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:21,240
Some federation and,

3788
01:35:21,241 --> 01:35:22,220
and put on an event,

3789
01:35:22,490 --> 01:35:23,900
you guys better figure this thing out.

3790
01:35:23,901 --> 01:35:24,734
So it was a really,

3791
01:35:24,740 --> 01:35:25,730
really big win for us.

3792
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:26,650
That's great.

3793
01:35:26,650 --> 01:35:27,580
Steve Heath,

3794
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:28,391
Steve Heath,

3795
01:35:28,391 --> 01:35:29,200
what did I say?

3796
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:29,741
I don't remember.

3797
01:35:29,741 --> 01:35:30,574
I say Steve something.

3798
01:35:30,580 --> 01:35:30,850
Yeah,

3799
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:32,050
maybe he killed him in the head.

3800
01:35:32,070 --> 01:35:32,320
Yep.

3801
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:35,020
Steve Hayes knocked him out and that's
what got chucked back in the UFC.

3802
01:35:35,021 --> 01:35:40,021
That fight is a Mohawk and all his fight
with knowing Hernandez was May 15th,

3803
01:35:41,140 --> 01:35:41,170
1998.

3804
01:35:41,170 --> 01:35:42,003
I was there.

3805
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:43,300
That was in mobile,

3806
01:35:43,301 --> 01:35:44,190
Alabama.

3807
01:35:46,090 --> 01:35:46,930
It was a,

3808
01:35:47,020 --> 01:35:48,510
that was interesting time span.

3809
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:50,430
That was fun.

3810
01:35:50,470 --> 01:35:50,760
It's been a,

3811
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:51,700
it's been a fun ride.

3812
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:52,301
Yeah.

3813
01:35:52,301 --> 01:35:54,370
So will you managing them in
the know or Hernandez days?

3814
01:35:54,850 --> 01:35:56,080
Um,

3815
01:35:56,260 --> 01:35:56,540
once,

3816
01:35:56,540 --> 01:35:58,310
I know wha how,

3817
01:35:58,340 --> 01:36:00,070
how much before that
Steve Heath fight was?

3818
01:36:00,190 --> 01:36:01,450
It looks like about a year.

3819
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:01,991
Yeah.

3820
01:36:01,991 --> 01:36:02,824
So Steve Heath,

3821
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:03,370
right?

3822
01:36:03,370 --> 01:36:05,230
Right before he bit more than a year.

3823
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:06,460
Is that the fight?

3824
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:07,430
It's actually almost two years.

3825
01:36:07,431 --> 01:36:08,500
Was there a fight in between there?

3826
01:36:08,950 --> 01:36:09,291
Yes.

3827
01:36:09,291 --> 01:36:10,330
There's a couple of fights in between.

3828
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:11,860
What are the other two flights in between?

3829
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:12,520
He's,

3830
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:13,990
he actually fought Palae.

3831
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:14,400
Yeah.

3832
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:14,950
Um,

3833
01:36:14,950 --> 01:36:18,400
after that he fought noe Hernandez
was his first fight apparently.

3834
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:19,240
Um,

3835
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:23,080
and that was in the UFC and then he
went and he fought Palae over in the,

3836
01:36:23,081 --> 01:36:23,261
uh,

3837
01:36:23,261 --> 01:36:24,310
IVC in,

3838
01:36:24,311 --> 01:36:24,630
uh,

3839
01:36:24,630 --> 01:36:25,480
in Brazil,

3840
01:36:25,570 --> 01:36:28,510
which is the fucking
complete valley Tudo rules.

3841
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:32,410
Then he fought Jeremy Horn and he got
arm triangle right after Jeremy Horn.

3842
01:36:32,411 --> 01:36:33,250
I started managing them.

3843
01:36:33,251 --> 01:36:33,690
Yeah.

3844
01:36:33,690 --> 01:36:35,200
And that's when he left.

3845
01:36:35,230 --> 01:36:35,980
What year was that?

3846
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:37,300
That was in 99.

3847
01:36:37,450 --> 01:36:38,740
March 5th 99.

3848
01:36:38,830 --> 01:36:39,190
Uh,

3849
01:36:39,190 --> 01:36:40,390
Jeremy Horn triangled them.

3850
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:40,750
Joe,

3851
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:42,190
Joe Silva just texted me and said,

3852
01:36:42,191 --> 01:36:42,730
king mode.

3853
01:36:42,730 --> 01:36:42,981
Got It.

3854
01:36:42,981 --> 01:36:43,930
Knocked the fuck out.

3855
01:36:44,230 --> 01:36:45,970
Oh,

3856
01:36:46,330 --> 01:36:47,440
whoa.

3857
01:36:47,590 --> 01:36:48,423
By who?

3858
01:36:48,580 --> 01:36:52,420
I don't know who the king mo fight to him.

3859
01:36:52,421 --> 01:36:52,721
King.

3860
01:36:52,721 --> 01:36:53,500
Well,

3861
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:55,360
what did King King Mo got released for?

3862
01:36:55,370 --> 01:36:56,740
Did he do something crazy?

3863
01:36:56,770 --> 01:36:57,603
Like what happened?

3864
01:36:57,610 --> 01:36:57,761
Well,

3865
01:36:57,761 --> 01:36:59,010
what happened was going to strike fine.

3866
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:01,030
So what happened was he had a,

3867
01:37:01,870 --> 01:37:03,430
he tested positive for something.

3868
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:04,190
Uh,

3869
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:04,371
yeah,

3870
01:37:04,371 --> 01:37:07,580
he had some kind of steroids
or something and then,

3871
01:37:07,610 --> 01:37:07,940
uh,

3872
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:08,570
he was on,

3873
01:37:08,570 --> 01:37:09,500
he was on suspension.

3874
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:11,540
So while he was on suspension,

3875
01:37:11,541 --> 01:37:12,560
he got the offer

3876
01:37:13,020 --> 01:37:13,860
and uh,

3877
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:15,473
I let them go.

3878
01:37:16,140 --> 01:37:16,973
Wow.

3879
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:19,111
Yeah,

3880
01:37:19,111 --> 01:37:19,950
that's a,

3881
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:21,000
he just,

3882
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:21,271
yeah,

3883
01:37:21,271 --> 01:37:22,260
he just got knocked out.

3884
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:22,780
Yeah.

3885
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:23,290
Damn.

3886
01:37:23,290 --> 01:37:24,850
Is the UFC UFC ever,

3887
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:25,480
uh,

3888
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:26,350
id like,

3889
01:37:26,351 --> 01:37:27,101
thought of like a,

3890
01:37:27,101 --> 01:37:30,520
a different design for the octagon
or played with different ideas?

3891
01:37:30,521 --> 01:37:30,821
Like,

3892
01:37:30,821 --> 01:37:31,670
like more of like a,

3893
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:36,730
like a bowl type thing or a backwards
bubble or was there any other revisions to

3894
01:37:36,731 --> 01:37:36,990
the auction?

3895
01:37:36,990 --> 01:37:37,231
Yeah,

3896
01:37:37,231 --> 01:37:38,130
that's a good question.

3897
01:37:38,131 --> 01:37:39,120
Actually when we first,

3898
01:37:39,121 --> 01:37:39,750
uh,

3899
01:37:39,750 --> 01:37:41,160
when we first started doing it,

3900
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:42,113
um,

3901
01:37:42,270 --> 01:37:44,160
people were all freaked
out about the fence.

3902
01:37:44,490 --> 01:37:45,323
Even when we bought it,

3903
01:37:45,450 --> 01:37:46,580
I freaked out by the fence and said,

3904
01:37:46,581 --> 01:37:47,700
it's terrible for television.

3905
01:37:47,701 --> 01:37:48,534
It's just that,

3906
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:51,270
could you guys put plexiglass there?

3907
01:37:51,271 --> 01:37:53,220
Could you started going with a cop out?

3908
01:37:53,221 --> 01:37:54,900
Some clear fencing so it's not,

3909
01:37:55,290 --> 01:37:55,980
it's clear and you

3910
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:56,813
could see through it.

3911
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:58,193
Um,

3912
01:37:58,350 --> 01:37:59,183
is that possible?

3913
01:37:59,190 --> 01:38:00,210
All kinds of stuff.

3914
01:38:00,370 --> 01:38:00,960
Have your friend,

3915
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:02,730
we cleared all kinds of stuff.

3916
01:38:03,570 --> 01:38:05,480
You still couldn't see through
the clear stuff when it,

3917
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:06,150
if it was there,

3918
01:38:06,150 --> 01:38:09,000
did you ever see the
thing called shoot box?

3919
01:38:09,270 --> 01:38:10,070
Did you ever see that?

3920
01:38:10,070 --> 01:38:10,500
Yeah.

3921
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:13,990
Where frank shamrock did some crazy
thing where they fought in like a play.

3922
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:14,873
It was like a plate,

3923
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:15,850
like a giant Lego.

3924
01:38:16,830 --> 01:38:17,300
Yeah.

3925
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:20,040
And not quite like a bowl because
it wasn't that let they let extreme,

3926
01:38:20,041 --> 01:38:20,371
but yeah,

3927
01:38:20,371 --> 01:38:21,120
sort of.

3928
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:23,040
It was I think,

3929
01:38:23,041 --> 01:38:23,251
yeah,

3930
01:38:23,251 --> 01:38:24,120
I think I remember that.

3931
01:38:24,121 --> 01:38:24,570
That was,

3932
01:38:24,570 --> 01:38:25,590
and then um,

3933
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:28,170
Bob Meyrowitz tried to bring you back.

3934
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:30,660
Was it called Ya'll?

3935
01:38:30,690 --> 01:38:33,270
Yama Yama pit fire fighting,

3936
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:34,051
is that what it was called?

3937
01:38:34,051 --> 01:38:34,884
Yeah,

3938
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:37,043
yeah,

3939
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:37,990
yeah.

3940
01:38:37,990 --> 01:38:39,690
With some new name for it.

3941
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:40,640
Yeah.

3942
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:41,401
And it was like,

3943
01:38:41,401 --> 01:38:42,840
it was a cage though still,

3944
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:45,960
but it was a cage with like a
slope to it for some reason.

3945
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:46,440
Right?

3946
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:46,811
Wasn't it?

3947
01:38:46,811 --> 01:38:46,921
No,

3948
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:47,500
I remember,

3949
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:49,410
I think it was like a pit
that was in the ground.

3950
01:38:49,710 --> 01:38:50,880
I think it was actually in the ground.

3951
01:38:50,881 --> 01:38:52,260
So there was no cage at all?

3952
01:38:52,261 --> 01:38:52,830
I don't think so.

3953
01:38:52,830 --> 01:38:53,281
Oh fuck.

3954
01:38:53,281 --> 01:38:54,091
I can't remember man.

3955
01:38:54,091 --> 01:38:55,170
There's been so much shit.

3956
01:38:55,470 --> 01:38:57,750
And then chuck to Chuck Norris,

3957
01:38:57,980 --> 01:38:58,501
he had that,

3958
01:38:58,501 --> 01:38:58,830
uh,

3959
01:38:58,830 --> 01:39:00,140
those kickboxing matches.

3960
01:39:00,150 --> 01:39:02,640
This was called like a bowl
that actually got on TV.

3961
01:39:02,670 --> 01:39:03,030
Yeah.

3962
01:39:03,030 --> 01:39:03,301
Yeah.

3963
01:39:03,301 --> 01:39:04,134
What was it called?

3964
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:05,730
World Combat League.

3965
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:06,150
Yeah.

3966
01:39:06,150 --> 01:39:06,983
World Combat League.

3967
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:10,650
I actually watched some
of those fights in Vegas.

3968
01:39:10,651 --> 01:39:11,820
I went and I met Chuck Norris.

3969
01:39:11,850 --> 01:39:12,840
Chuck Norris gave me a hug.

3970
01:39:12,841 --> 01:39:13,521
He knew who I was.

3971
01:39:13,521 --> 01:39:14,670
It was a greatest moment of my life.

3972
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:14,821
Yeah.

3973
01:39:14,821 --> 01:39:15,654
That's cool man.

3974
01:39:15,690 --> 01:39:16,830
I like Chuck Norris Duck.

3975
01:39:16,831 --> 01:39:17,041
Yeah,

3976
01:39:17,041 --> 01:39:17,640
man.

3977
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:18,301
Chuck Norris.

3978
01:39:18,301 --> 01:39:19,140
Norris is a legend.

3979
01:39:19,141 --> 01:39:19,711
He's a stud.

3980
01:39:19,711 --> 01:39:20,100
I love it.

3981
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:21,840
I only have a few things in the DVR here,

3982
01:39:21,841 --> 01:39:22,770
but one of them is Walker,

3983
01:39:22,771 --> 01:39:23,604
Texas ranger.

3984
01:39:23,610 --> 01:39:23,820
Yeah.

3985
01:39:23,820 --> 01:39:26,520
They got best pride and UFC fights.

3986
01:39:26,521 --> 01:39:28,530
I got a bunch of UFC
fights and I've got Walker,

3987
01:39:28,531 --> 01:39:29,400
Texas ranger.

3988
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:30,361
I love Walker,

3989
01:39:30,361 --> 01:39:31,110
Texas Ranger.

3990
01:39:31,110 --> 01:39:32,060
You remember the uh,

3991
01:39:32,310 --> 01:39:32,790
wait,

3992
01:39:32,790 --> 01:39:33,623
what was the other one?

3993
01:39:33,810 --> 01:39:35,060
The other one was lone wolf McQuaid.

3994
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:40,710
He based the TV show off of that was
quite a bit better movie than the

3995
01:39:40,711 --> 01:39:41,370
television show.

3996
01:39:41,370 --> 01:39:42,151
It was really good.

3997
01:39:42,151 --> 01:39:43,050
The movie was really good.

3998
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:43,291
You know,

3999
01:39:43,291 --> 01:39:44,280
you remember the movie,

4000
01:39:44,370 --> 01:39:45,480
it's hard to find these days.

4001
01:39:45,630 --> 01:39:46,440
The octagon.

4002
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:47,010
Yes.

4003
01:39:47,010 --> 01:39:48,660
Where he goes and fights the Ninjas.

4004
01:39:48,690 --> 01:39:49,441
That's right.

4005
01:39:49,441 --> 01:39:49,831
Yeah.

4006
01:39:49,831 --> 01:39:50,670
I love that fucking,

4007
01:39:50,730 --> 01:39:52,650
and that was one of my
favorite movies growing up.

4008
01:39:52,890 --> 01:39:53,191
Yeah,

4009
01:39:53,191 --> 01:39:53,881
that's right.

4010
01:39:53,881 --> 01:39:55,110
That was the original,

4011
01:39:55,111 --> 01:39:59,210
I mean the octagon that's way pre UFC
where they trying to find that on DVD on,

4012
01:39:59,490 --> 01:40:00,480
it's almost impossible.

4013
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:04,140
That term octagon is so
synonymous now with the UFC.

4014
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:07,200
He never even thought that it had
another martial arts application.

4015
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:07,411
Way,

4016
01:40:07,411 --> 01:40:07,621
way,

4017
01:40:07,621 --> 01:40:07,861
way,

4018
01:40:07,861 --> 01:40:08,071
way,

4019
01:40:08,071 --> 01:40:09,240
way back in the day.

4020
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:10,950
Like when you think about an octagon,

4021
01:40:10,951 --> 01:40:12,500
an eight sided circle like that,

4022
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:13,560
that is the UFC.

4023
01:40:13,561 --> 01:40:15,570
Now as you think about the octagon,

4024
01:40:15,571 --> 01:40:17,820
like that's the only time
I ever hear of an octagon.

4025
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:18,953
I don't ever,

4026
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,270
there's no other octagon.

4027
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:21,210
I don't see them,

4028
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:21,661
you know,

4029
01:40:21,661 --> 01:40:24,240
obviously I'm not a GM attrition.

4030
01:40:24,290 --> 01:40:24,540
What did,

4031
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:25,020
what does it?

4032
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:25,980
Geometry to college.

4033
01:40:26,380 --> 01:40:27,213
That's just not the same thing.

4034
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:28,370
Yeah.

4035
01:40:28,370 --> 01:40:31,170
I mean octagon is now UFC
and that's what it is.

4036
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:33,030
And you guys own that,

4037
01:40:33,031 --> 01:40:33,301
right?

4038
01:40:33,301 --> 01:40:35,160
Do you look to lease that out to people?

4039
01:40:35,510 --> 01:40:36,343
Yup.

4040
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:38,520
So there's companies that
actually build them and stuff.

4041
01:40:38,521 --> 01:40:38,820
They,

4042
01:40:38,820 --> 01:40:40,020
they pay us a trademark fee.

4043
01:40:40,230 --> 01:40:41,370
Now when you guys bought pride,

4044
01:40:41,371 --> 01:40:42,480
did you think about keeping the key,

4045
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:42,841
the,

4046
01:40:42,841 --> 01:40:46,560
the ring or when you were thinking about
actually trying to do shows over in

4047
01:40:46,561 --> 01:40:47,760
Japan as pride?

4048
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:47,971
Yeah.

4049
01:40:47,971 --> 01:40:49,530
We were to keep the ring
and do the whole deal.

4050
01:40:49,580 --> 01:40:49,770
Yeah,

4051
01:40:49,770 --> 01:40:50,670
we were going to try to do it.

4052
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,500
That is the craziest story of all time.

4053
01:40:52,540 --> 01:40:54,130
You guys paid $65 million

4054
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:55,840
for essentially a video library.

4055
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:00,280
So crafty.

4056
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:02,110
Every deal I ever did,

4057
01:41:02,111 --> 01:41:03,530
everything that ever happened over there,

4058
01:41:03,531 --> 01:41:04,480
it was fucking crazy,

4059
01:41:04,481 --> 01:41:04,840
man.

4060
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:05,673
They have a different way.

4061
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:08,350
It's a different world over there.

4062
01:41:09,130 --> 01:41:09,941
When I met you,

4063
01:41:09,941 --> 01:41:14,020
you were this fucking regular dude
with like a job that you were like,

4064
01:41:14,050 --> 01:41:14,351
oh,

4065
01:41:14,351 --> 01:41:15,490
I don't know what I'm doing now.

4066
01:41:15,610 --> 01:41:20,610
To go from that to driving Ferrari's and
private jets and you've managed to be

4067
01:41:21,551 --> 01:41:22,630
the same guy.

4068
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:23,920
How have you,

4069
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:27,130
how have you not like lost your shit?

4070
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:28,090
How have you not like,

4071
01:41:28,210 --> 01:41:28,511
I mean,

4072
01:41:28,511 --> 01:41:32,350
obviously you yell at people on Twitter
and say a few questionable things,

4073
01:41:32,540 --> 01:41:34,160
but that I,

4074
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:35,383
you know,

4075
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:38,000
I see,

4076
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,660
I see so many of this.

4077
01:41:39,670 --> 01:41:40,510
So much of this stuff.

4078
01:41:40,511 --> 01:41:41,110
Go on.

4079
01:41:41,110 --> 01:41:41,771
Hey Elliot,

4080
01:41:41,771 --> 01:41:43,110
get off the phone or shut the door.

4081
01:41:43,140 --> 01:41:45,580
Stupid came here,

4082
01:41:45,790 --> 01:41:46,031
dude,

4083
01:41:46,031 --> 01:41:46,631
my monkeys.

4084
01:41:46,631 --> 01:41:48,130
I bring these fucking guys everywhere.

4085
01:41:48,130 --> 01:41:49,150
They fuck something up.

4086
01:41:49,151 --> 01:41:50,050
You have no idea.

4087
01:41:50,330 --> 01:41:53,970
It doesn't even realize we're doing
a fucking podcast works for you too.

4088
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:54,250
Yeah,

4089
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:54,860
you don't care.

4090
01:41:54,860 --> 01:41:55,500
It's that of a bitch.

4091
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:57,760
He makes your video blogs talking.

4092
01:41:58,210 --> 01:41:58,481
Oh yeah,

4093
01:41:58,481 --> 01:41:59,320
it's a hard worker.

4094
01:41:59,830 --> 01:42:00,610
Oh yes,

4095
01:42:00,610 --> 01:42:00,971
no doubt.

4096
01:42:00,971 --> 01:42:03,750
He still needs to shut the
fuck up and podcasts going on.

4097
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:05,320
Have you,

4098
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:06,850
have you ever stepped back and go,

4099
01:42:06,851 --> 01:42:08,020
how the fuck did this happen?

4100
01:42:08,021 --> 01:42:08,231
I mean,

4101
01:42:08,231 --> 01:42:11,320
there's not a whole lot of people that
have that kind of a rags to riches story.

4102
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:11,711
I mean,

4103
01:42:11,711 --> 01:42:13,540
that's a pretty fucking crazy story.

4104
01:42:14,050 --> 01:42:18,700
You go from 2001 to be in the president
of this unlikely president of this

4105
01:42:18,701 --> 01:42:19,061
company.

4106
01:42:19,061 --> 01:42:19,331
You Go,

4107
01:42:19,331 --> 01:42:19,920
you were,

4108
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:20,420
you were like a,

4109
01:42:20,420 --> 01:42:22,330
a manager of fighters.

4110
01:42:22,420 --> 01:42:22,721
You know,

4111
01:42:22,721 --> 01:42:25,840
you had some foothold in the fight game,

4112
01:42:25,841 --> 01:42:26,180
you'd,

4113
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:26,590
you,

4114
01:42:26,590 --> 01:42:27,970
he'd done boxercise class.

4115
01:42:27,980 --> 01:42:31,180
The only point in time where I had a
real job I've ever fucking had was,

4116
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:31,481
uh,

4117
01:42:31,481 --> 01:42:31,721
you know,

4118
01:42:31,721 --> 01:42:34,460
I was a bellman when I
was 19 years old at a,

4119
01:42:34,590 --> 01:42:35,890
at a hotel in Boston.

4120
01:42:35,890 --> 01:42:36,101
And you know,

4121
01:42:36,101 --> 01:42:37,180
I did some construction work.

4122
01:42:37,181 --> 01:42:38,140
All the shit you doing here,

4123
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:38,920
you know,

4124
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:39,431
17,

4125
01:42:39,431 --> 01:42:39,701
18,

4126
01:42:39,701 --> 01:42:40,534
19.

4127
01:42:40,630 --> 01:42:41,350
And uh,

4128
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:41,980
that was it.

4129
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:44,710
One day I walked out of that hotel
when I was 19 years old and said,

4130
01:42:45,070 --> 01:42:46,630
I'm gonna be in the
fucking fight business.

4131
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:47,110
That's it.

4132
01:42:47,110 --> 01:42:47,560
I'm done.

4133
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:48,430
I'm done with this shit.

4134
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:49,660
I hate coming here every day.

4135
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:50,980
You know,

4136
01:42:50,980 --> 01:42:52,030
every other fucking week.

4137
01:42:52,031 --> 01:42:54,640
There was some kid that just graduated
college and would come in and start

4138
01:42:54,641 --> 01:42:55,750
telling you what the fuck can do.

4139
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:56,370
I was like,

4140
01:42:56,370 --> 01:42:56,500
Oh,

4141
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:58,560
I'm so done with this
shit fight business too.

4142
01:42:58,570 --> 01:43:01,730
But thinking about getting into
the fight business at 19 Shelly,

4143
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:04,300
where the fuck even cause you
know how many fucking anymore,

4144
01:43:04,310 --> 01:43:06,280
but how many decisions I've
made my life to people.

4145
01:43:06,281 --> 01:43:08,380
Like that's the fucking
dumbest thing I've ever heard.

4146
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:13,300
Like literally almost every decision
I've ever made because you have amateur

4147
01:43:13,301 --> 01:43:14,134
fights.

4148
01:43:14,530 --> 01:43:17,800
I fought in the amateurs and dude,

4149
01:43:17,830 --> 01:43:20,290
there was a time when I thought,

4150
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:21,191
you know,

4151
01:43:21,191 --> 01:43:23,380
and I think that's why I can,

4152
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:25,053
you know,

4153
01:43:25,060 --> 01:43:27,040
deal with the fighters and I understand,

4154
01:43:27,340 --> 01:43:27,581
you know,

4155
01:43:27,581 --> 01:43:29,230
like dealing with the ultimate fighter.

4156
01:43:29,770 --> 01:43:31,900
There was a fucking time
in a day when there was,

4157
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:34,540
the only fucking thing I
cared about was boxing.

4158
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:39,100
That's why I literally walked out of that
place because I loved it so much that

4159
01:43:39,101 --> 01:43:40,690
that's all I fucking wanted to do.

4160
01:43:41,230 --> 01:43:43,420
The problem is you go out
there and you start fucking,

4161
01:43:43,421 --> 01:43:45,610
you know that that's what I
wanted to do for a living.

4162
01:43:46,150 --> 01:43:49,000
And then the reality starts to set in,

4163
01:43:49,001 --> 01:43:49,840
and I'll never forget,

4164
01:43:49,841 --> 01:43:51,570
I mean I've told this before,

4165
01:43:51,571 --> 01:43:52,200
but

4166
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:55,230
I was in the gym one day and

4167
01:43:56,910 --> 01:43:58,830
there was this dude who
was a local fighter.

4168
01:43:58,831 --> 01:43:59,730
I don't say his name.

4169
01:43:59,820 --> 01:44:01,890
You would probably fucking
know them if I said his name.

4170
01:44:01,891 --> 01:44:02,581
I guarantee,

4171
01:44:02,581 --> 01:44:03,290
you know,

4172
01:44:03,290 --> 01:44:05,160
because he was famous in the Boston area,

4173
01:44:05,190 --> 01:44:05,730
you know,

4174
01:44:05,730 --> 01:44:06,660
like a local guy.

4175
01:44:07,950 --> 01:44:10,500
And he came in one day and he was like,

4176
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:12,600
he was in his early thirties,

4177
01:44:12,601 --> 01:44:14,430
he was like 31 or 32.

4178
01:44:15,510 --> 01:44:16,343
And uh,

4179
01:44:16,470 --> 01:44:17,460
he was fucked up.

4180
01:44:17,970 --> 01:44:18,600
You know,

4181
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:19,710
he was punchy.

4182
01:44:20,190 --> 01:44:21,660
He fucking moping around,

4183
01:44:21,661 --> 01:44:22,920
kind of thrown fucked.

4184
01:44:22,930 --> 01:44:24,540
And I remember the day
that I looked at him,

4185
01:44:24,541 --> 01:44:24,811
I said,

4186
01:44:24,811 --> 01:44:25,644
fuck,

4187
01:44:25,890 --> 01:44:27,180
what if that happens to me?

4188
01:44:27,930 --> 01:44:30,480
And then the minute you fucking
start thinking like that,

4189
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:31,651
you're,

4190
01:44:31,651 --> 01:44:31,891
you're,

4191
01:44:31,891 --> 01:44:32,191
you're,

4192
01:44:32,191 --> 01:44:33,390
you're not the real deal.

4193
01:44:33,391 --> 01:44:34,020
You're not,

4194
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:36,870
no matter how much you think
you want it or you think you do.

4195
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:39,120
It was the day I realized that I wasn't,

4196
01:44:39,870 --> 01:44:40,770
and I was fucking like,

4197
01:44:40,771 --> 01:44:41,604
wow.

4198
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:42,750
So then you start going,

4199
01:44:42,751 --> 01:44:44,820
how the fuck am I going to
make a living doing this?

4200
01:44:45,690 --> 01:44:48,000
And me and this dude,

4201
01:44:48,001 --> 01:44:51,090
Peter Welsh from Boston started,

4202
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:51,660
uh,

4203
01:44:51,660 --> 01:44:51,991
you know,

4204
01:44:51,991 --> 01:44:56,340
teaching people how to box
basically businessman and stuff.

4205
01:44:56,341 --> 01:44:57,290
Cause the,

4206
01:44:57,380 --> 01:44:58,050
the,

4207
01:44:58,050 --> 01:45:00,720
the business model wasn't first.

4208
01:45:00,721 --> 01:45:01,650
It's like martial arts.

4209
01:45:01,980 --> 01:45:03,660
If you want to take a martial arts class,

4210
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:06,870
it's fucking 50 martial arts
studios anywhere in any city,

4211
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:07,801
anywhere in the world.

4212
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:09,300
And it has been since I was a kid.

4213
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:10,513
Right.

4214
01:45:10,890 --> 01:45:11,723
And he

4215
01:45:12,530 --> 01:45:15,200
lack of martial arts schools around
your place when you were growing up.

4216
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:16,093
No.

4217
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:17,270
So if you want to buy,

4218
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:18,380
but if you want a box,

4219
01:45:18,381 --> 01:45:19,280
you got to go and fight.

4220
01:45:19,310 --> 01:45:20,780
You got to go get your
fucking head punched in.

4221
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:22,031
You know what I mean?

4222
01:45:22,031 --> 01:45:22,310
You know,

4223
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:22,791
especially,

4224
01:45:22,791 --> 01:45:23,990
you know the places in Boston,

4225
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:28,420
you had the Somerville Boxing Club had
the fucking place down at the mcdonough

4226
01:45:28,421 --> 01:45:29,450
down in South Boston.

4227
01:45:29,540 --> 01:45:29,890
Yeah.

4228
01:45:29,890 --> 01:45:30,150
And,

4229
01:45:30,150 --> 01:45:30,420
and,

4230
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:30,740
and,

4231
01:45:30,740 --> 01:45:31,420
and the,

4232
01:45:31,420 --> 01:45:33,890
the Petronellis down in Brockton and,

4233
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:35,480
and places like that.

4234
01:45:35,870 --> 01:45:37,580
And you went in and they would fucking,

4235
01:45:37,610 --> 01:45:39,140
you'd get your dick knocked loose.

4236
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:40,000
Right.

4237
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,120
And if you came back,

4238
01:45:41,150 --> 01:45:42,650
maybe they'd fucking work with you.

4239
01:45:42,770 --> 01:45:42,861
Well,

4240
01:45:42,861 --> 01:45:43,850
even guys had lights.

4241
01:45:43,851 --> 01:45:44,481
You would do that.

4242
01:45:44,481 --> 01:45:45,190
Like I got,

4243
01:45:45,190 --> 01:45:46,650
I got trained by Joe Lake and that's,

4244
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:47,570
that's what he did with me.

4245
01:45:47,571 --> 01:45:48,860
He just stuck me in with guys.

4246
01:45:48,861 --> 01:45:50,190
You know that a box and they all do.

4247
01:45:51,030 --> 01:45:51,863
They all do.

4248
01:45:52,940 --> 01:45:54,140
They do it quickly too.

4249
01:45:54,141 --> 01:45:55,940
Like we're right right from the beginning.

4250
01:45:55,941 --> 01:45:57,470
Find out how much you enjoy doing this.

4251
01:45:57,620 --> 01:45:58,450
Do you really want to do it?

4252
01:45:58,450 --> 01:45:59,720
Then they're wasting my time here.

4253
01:45:59,870 --> 01:46:00,531
Exactly right.

4254
01:46:00,531 --> 01:46:02,870
I'm going to teach you how to throw
some punches and then we're going to put

4255
01:46:02,871 --> 01:46:03,770
your head gear on.

4256
01:46:03,771 --> 01:46:06,920
Let me put your fuck of Vaseline on your
face and then they can show me what you

4257
01:46:06,921 --> 01:46:07,161
got.

4258
01:46:07,161 --> 01:46:08,450
The first time they ever went into box,

4259
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:10,070
they had me do fucking rings circles.

4260
01:46:10,071 --> 01:46:10,341
You know what?

4261
01:46:10,341 --> 01:46:14,360
Those are right where you go laterally
around the ring fucking coming in every

4262
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:15,260
day they have to ring circles,

4263
01:46:15,261 --> 01:46:15,741
rink circles,

4264
01:46:15,741 --> 01:46:16,221
rank circles,

4265
01:46:16,221 --> 01:46:17,054
rank circles,

4266
01:46:17,090 --> 01:46:17,571
and I was like,

4267
01:46:17,571 --> 01:46:18,404
what the fuck?

4268
01:46:18,650 --> 01:46:19,580
I paid my dues.

4269
01:46:19,581 --> 01:46:20,990
I paid my fucking eight bucks.

4270
01:46:20,991 --> 01:46:21,824
You know what I mean?

4271
01:46:22,130 --> 01:46:22,730
Oh,

4272
01:46:22,730 --> 01:46:24,410
I fuck you got mad one day I said,

4273
01:46:24,860 --> 01:46:26,420
I came here and learn how to fucking box.

4274
01:46:26,421 --> 01:46:26,571
Man.

4275
01:46:26,571 --> 01:46:30,140
I've been running around in circles
for fucking weeks and he's like,

4276
01:46:30,141 --> 01:46:30,231
Oh,

4277
01:46:30,231 --> 01:46:31,041
you want to learn how to box,

4278
01:46:31,041 --> 01:46:33,700
right fucking fucking gear you up,

4279
01:46:33,701 --> 01:46:34,430
man.

4280
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:34,701
Love.

4281
01:46:34,701 --> 01:46:35,810
Yet they throw you in there.

4282
01:46:37,090 --> 01:46:37,390
They

4283
01:46:37,390 --> 01:46:39,490
beat the fuck Outta you.

4284
01:46:40,150 --> 01:46:42,880
Fucking dropped me 50
times with body shots,

4285
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:44,590
punching my fucking head.

4286
01:46:44,591 --> 01:46:47,080
In the worst of the body
shots when you first started,

4287
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:48,940
you start taking some body shots from a,

4288
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:51,420
who knows how to throw him and uh,

4289
01:46:51,421 --> 01:46:53,160
you know you're fucking lips are bleeding.

4290
01:46:53,161 --> 01:46:54,060
Your nose is bleeding.

4291
01:46:54,061 --> 01:46:54,894
You're fucked up.

4292
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:55,913
You get out.

4293
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:59,460
You're completely morally destroyed.

4294
01:46:59,610 --> 01:47:00,443
You know what I mean?

4295
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:01,930
Because boxing is never,

4296
01:47:01,970 --> 01:47:04,470
or sparring is never what
guys think it's going to be.

4297
01:47:04,770 --> 01:47:05,310
You know,

4298
01:47:05,310 --> 01:47:06,750
your watch too many fucking movies.

4299
01:47:06,751 --> 01:47:09,740
You go in there and you think you're
going to spar and you get shit kicked out

4300
01:47:09,741 --> 01:47:09,901
of you.

4301
01:47:09,901 --> 01:47:10,734
But then,

4302
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:11,640
you know,

4303
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:15,180
I went home that night and I remember
laying in bed thinking the whole might

4304
01:47:15,210 --> 01:47:17,550
fuck I got my ass whooped that slug,

4305
01:47:17,551 --> 01:47:17,731
this,

4306
01:47:17,731 --> 01:47:18,420
that,

4307
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:21,480
and I went back to the gym
the next day and that was it.

4308
01:47:21,820 --> 01:47:23,070
There no working with you

4309
01:47:23,890 --> 01:47:24,221
blacks.

4310
01:47:24,221 --> 01:47:24,850
They want to fight.

4311
01:47:24,850 --> 01:47:26,110
They just want to kick someone's ass.

4312
01:47:26,230 --> 01:47:26,771
It's true.

4313
01:47:26,771 --> 01:47:27,730
They don't understand that.

4314
01:47:27,731 --> 01:47:28,960
That kind of kick your ass too.

4315
01:47:28,990 --> 01:47:31,150
Like this is not going
to be an even exchange.

4316
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:32,800
And if you're not willing to go to war,

4317
01:47:32,801 --> 01:47:36,790
if you're not willing to take like big
shots and be in pain and push through,

4318
01:47:37,240 --> 01:47:38,620
you're never going to do this.

4319
01:47:38,621 --> 01:47:39,311
This is you.

4320
01:47:39,311 --> 01:47:39,570
You,

4321
01:47:39,570 --> 01:47:43,030
you have to figure out somewhere along
the line whether or not you're willing to

4322
01:47:43,031 --> 01:47:43,864
take punishment,

4323
01:47:44,020 --> 01:47:44,900
whether an old picture

4324
01:47:45,020 --> 01:47:45,853
punishment,

4325
01:47:46,130 --> 01:47:46,970
some guys can't.

4326
01:47:46,971 --> 01:47:47,840
So that was what our,

4327
01:47:48,020 --> 01:47:49,850
what our business was based on.

4328
01:47:49,851 --> 01:47:50,450
You know,

4329
01:47:50,450 --> 01:47:50,811
Peter,

4330
01:47:50,811 --> 01:47:51,290
I,

4331
01:47:51,290 --> 01:47:52,123
yeah you could come,

4332
01:47:52,250 --> 01:47:53,540
you could come into the real gym.

4333
01:47:54,050 --> 01:47:57,830
We're real fighters trained and you learn
how to box just like white collar box.

4334
01:47:57,831 --> 01:47:58,100
Yeah.

4335
01:47:58,100 --> 01:48:01,130
So it was like you learn how to box but
you didn't get your ass kicked every

4336
01:48:01,130 --> 01:48:01,250
day.

4337
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:02,001
But some guys,

4338
01:48:02,001 --> 01:48:02,834
you know,

4339
01:48:03,020 --> 01:48:05,810
start trained for so long and get to
the level where they want to start

4340
01:48:05,811 --> 01:48:06,644
sparring.

4341
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:10,610
But you rarely ever have white collar
guys that start sparring and want to do at

4342
01:48:10,611 --> 01:48:11,444
a fucking again.

4343
01:48:11,470 --> 01:48:12,610
Cause you know,

4344
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:13,550
like I said,

4345
01:48:13,550 --> 01:48:16,130
you get that first ass weapon and a,

4346
01:48:16,700 --> 01:48:18,470
and a lot of times what
happens is it breaks,

4347
01:48:18,770 --> 01:48:19,880
breaks out into fights,

4348
01:48:20,420 --> 01:48:21,080
you know.

4349
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:21,913
And uh,

4350
01:48:22,660 --> 01:48:23,100
we,

4351
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:23,600
we had,

4352
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:24,433
we used to,

4353
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:27,050
we used to bring the
inner city kids in too.

4354
01:48:27,110 --> 01:48:27,321
You know,

4355
01:48:27,321 --> 01:48:30,140
we had this idea where we're going to
bring in an inner city kids and you know,

4356
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:32,540
in southeast back then it
was still very segregated.

4357
01:48:32,900 --> 01:48:35,780
So we are going to bring in blacks and
Hispanics and all these other kids and

4358
01:48:35,781 --> 01:48:37,220
bring them together and you know,

4359
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:38,660
we're going to do all the fuck.

4360
01:48:39,230 --> 01:48:40,760
We used to bring these kids in man.

4361
01:48:40,761 --> 01:48:42,000
And we started training them and stuff.

4362
01:48:42,001 --> 01:48:43,790
And then as soon as guys
would start sparring,

4363
01:48:44,330 --> 01:48:44,481
you know,

4364
01:48:44,481 --> 01:48:47,630
how many fucking situations we had were
guys would come back and with bats,

4365
01:48:48,260 --> 01:48:49,970
like there'd be a bad sparring deal,

4366
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:54,300
come back with bats or they'd come back
with their brothers or some kind of crap

4367
01:48:54,350 --> 01:48:55,880
just every fucking day.

4368
01:48:55,881 --> 01:48:57,320
That was so that whole,

4369
01:48:57,660 --> 01:48:57,890
you know,

4370
01:48:57,890 --> 01:49:00,140
let's bring in the inner city
kids and fucking tried to work.

4371
01:49:00,170 --> 01:49:01,250
It didn't go over well.

4372
01:49:01,490 --> 01:49:02,000
Yeah.

4373
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,660
That's playing that
experiment and then work to

4374
01:49:05,010 --> 01:49:05,843
a lot of work.

4375
01:49:06,050 --> 01:49:07,850
It's interesting to see the uh,

4376
01:49:07,910 --> 01:49:08,780
the attitude,

4377
01:49:08,810 --> 01:49:09,081
you know,

4378
01:49:09,081 --> 01:49:10,370
that used to exist back then,

4379
01:49:10,371 --> 01:49:13,910
the boxing gyms and now that people are,

4380
01:49:14,730 --> 01:49:14,990
we're,

4381
01:49:14,990 --> 01:49:18,680
we're seeing this evolution in mixed
martial arts where the beginning,

4382
01:49:18,980 --> 01:49:21,680
we saw a lot of like gym wars,

4383
01:49:21,860 --> 01:49:26,860
like that would be like a really normal
occurrence in gyms where guys would just

4384
01:49:27,201 --> 01:49:28,460
beat the fuck out of each other.

4385
01:49:28,461 --> 01:49:31,100
And you hear about fighters getting
knocked out in the gym left and right and

4386
01:49:31,101 --> 01:49:31,934
left and right.

4387
01:49:32,150 --> 01:49:34,520
But now I think people are
starting to realize like,

4388
01:49:34,521 --> 01:49:34,670
Whoa,

4389
01:49:34,670 --> 01:49:34,841
Whoa,

4390
01:49:34,841 --> 01:49:34,941
Whoa,

4391
01:49:34,941 --> 01:49:35,061
whoa,

4392
01:49:35,061 --> 01:49:35,260
whoa,

4393
01:49:35,260 --> 01:49:35,430
hey,

4394
01:49:35,430 --> 01:49:36,950
there's no fucking benefit in this.

4395
01:49:36,951 --> 01:49:37,970
Like what's going on here?

4396
01:49:38,090 --> 01:49:40,820
But we're gonna we're
looking at a gigantic multi,

4397
01:49:40,830 --> 01:49:41,271
multi,

4398
01:49:41,271 --> 01:49:45,320
multimillion dollar business and this is
how we're treating our commodities and

4399
01:49:45,321 --> 01:49:46,154
our prospects.

4400
01:49:46,290 --> 01:49:46,530
We're,

4401
01:49:46,530 --> 01:49:48,330
we're throwing at each
other and lend them,

4402
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:51,870
blast each other and due to getting
punchy way before their time.

4403
01:49:52,020 --> 01:49:54,120
And we both know Jim's work guys,

4404
01:49:54,150 --> 01:49:56,910
they get Chiney way too quick and you go,

4405
01:49:56,911 --> 01:49:57,091
well,

4406
01:49:57,091 --> 01:49:57,301
what?

4407
01:49:57,301 --> 01:50:00,270
How's this guy like this guy had
an iron changes three years ago.

4408
01:50:00,380 --> 01:50:00,480
Well,

4409
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:01,920
let's take a fucking gym wars.

4410
01:50:01,921 --> 01:50:03,900
He's going through gym
wars on a regular basis.

4411
01:50:04,290 --> 01:50:05,310
That was shoot the box.

4412
01:50:05,311 --> 01:50:08,280
That was the deal at shoot the
box and shogun himself said like,

4413
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:09,671
we realize,

4414
01:50:09,671 --> 01:50:10,070
you know,

4415
01:50:10,070 --> 01:50:11,050
after doing that for awhile,

4416
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:12,180
we can't do that anymore.

4417
01:50:12,420 --> 01:50:12,770
What?

4418
01:50:12,770 --> 01:50:13,100
I know

4419
01:50:13,100 --> 01:50:13,371
I,

4420
01:50:13,371 --> 01:50:14,780
that's how it was in boxing too though.

4421
01:50:14,781 --> 01:50:15,140
When I,

4422
01:50:15,140 --> 01:50:16,790
when I was involved in boxing,

4423
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:18,920
some of the best fights I
ever saw her in the jet.

4424
01:50:18,930 --> 01:50:19,763
Oh yeah.

4425
01:50:20,300 --> 01:50:21,080
Oh hell yeah.

4426
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:21,590
One day,

4427
01:50:21,590 --> 01:50:23,360
one day I saw uh,

4428
01:50:23,910 --> 01:50:24,743
uh,

4429
01:50:25,370 --> 01:50:28,370
Livingstone bramble and Roger Mayweather.

4430
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:30,440
Oh fucking go at it.

4431
01:50:30,870 --> 01:50:32,510
At a fucking gym in Vegas.

4432
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:33,230
Yeah.

4433
01:50:33,230 --> 01:50:34,063
Another time.

4434
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:34,740
Wow.

4435
01:50:34,740 --> 01:50:36,890
One of the gyms cause cause
we all worked together.

4436
01:50:37,100 --> 01:50:38,450
I worked with Mayweather,

4437
01:50:38,750 --> 01:50:40,220
I worked with Nick one kick,

4438
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:41,383
um,

4439
01:50:41,690 --> 01:50:43,280
Floyd when Floyd was first coming.

4440
01:50:43,310 --> 01:50:45,830
I mean we all worked
together in these gyms,

4441
01:50:46,130 --> 01:50:46,963
you know.

4442
01:50:46,970 --> 01:50:47,900
And uh,

4443
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:50,600
one time there was this dude,

4444
01:50:50,601 --> 01:50:51,311
he was the heavyweight,

4445
01:50:51,311 --> 01:50:54,890
his name is Tracy and him and Roger
Mayweather fucking got into it.

4446
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:55,340
He was,

4447
01:50:55,340 --> 01:50:56,720
Tracy was a young heavyweight,

4448
01:50:56,990 --> 01:50:58,070
24 year old kid,

4449
01:50:58,071 --> 01:50:58,904
heavyweight.

4450
01:50:59,330 --> 01:51:01,530
And Roger was fucking one 47.

4451
01:51:01,531 --> 01:51:01,830
Yeah.

4452
01:51:01,830 --> 01:51:02,720
In his forties.

4453
01:51:03,530 --> 01:51:04,363
And Roger said,

4454
01:51:04,550 --> 01:51:05,670
what you say mother,

4455
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:07,460
is it done at the fucking gate into it?

4456
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:08,390
Both the back and forth.

4457
01:51:08,391 --> 01:51:08,601
I go,

4458
01:51:08,601 --> 01:51:09,434
Oh shit.

4459
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:10,251
Here we go.

4460
01:51:10,251 --> 01:51:11,940
And they got in the fucking
ring and start a fight,

4461
01:51:11,980 --> 01:51:12,813
man.

4462
01:51:13,150 --> 01:51:13,610
Yeah.

4463
01:51:13,610 --> 01:51:14,840
They started fucking fighting.

4464
01:51:14,841 --> 01:51:17,720
And at the end of the round
when the bell went off,

4465
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:21,350
Tracy tried to stop and Roger
fucking lit him up and he goes,

4466
01:51:21,590 --> 01:51:22,161
no rounds,

4467
01:51:22,161 --> 01:51:22,994
motherfucker,

4468
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:24,433
no routes.

4469
01:51:24,890 --> 01:51:29,750
So they just kept fighting straight
fucking through until fucking Tracy quit.

4470
01:51:29,990 --> 01:51:31,300
Oh my God,

4471
01:51:31,301 --> 01:51:32,480
you're fucking whooped his ass.

4472
01:51:32,481 --> 01:51:33,350
And he fucking quit.

4473
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:34,670
And forties.

4474
01:51:34,690 --> 01:51:34,910
Yeah.

4475
01:51:34,910 --> 01:51:35,360
And then,

4476
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:36,260
and then when he quit,

4477
01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:37,760
Roger hit him another eight,

4478
01:51:37,761 --> 01:51:39,810
nine times after you fucking quit.

4479
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:40,710
And He,

4480
01:51:40,710 --> 01:51:41,750
and he was basically like,

4481
01:51:41,751 --> 01:51:43,580
don't ever fucking mouth off to me.

4482
01:51:43,581 --> 01:51:44,270
And this gym,

4483
01:51:44,270 --> 01:51:44,361
uh,

4484
01:51:44,361 --> 01:51:46,580
one 47 pound 40 year olds,

4485
01:51:46,750 --> 01:51:48,600
but Roger May Mamba.

4486
01:51:48,830 --> 01:51:49,300
Yup.

4487
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:49,541
You know,

4488
01:51:49,541 --> 01:51:50,800
a lot of people don't know Roger.

4489
01:51:50,801 --> 01:51:51,551
You know a lot of people,

4490
01:51:51,551 --> 01:51:52,630
everybody knows Floyd.

4491
01:51:52,631 --> 01:51:53,464
But Roger,

4492
01:51:53,470 --> 01:51:55,510
his uncle in his time,

4493
01:51:55,511 --> 01:51:56,930
he was a bad motherfucker.

4494
01:51:57,010 --> 01:51:58,780
He had a piston right hand.

4495
01:51:58,840 --> 01:51:59,440
Yep.

4496
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:03,340
He had a nasty jab and he would
fucking slam that right hand in.

4497
01:52:03,370 --> 01:52:05,860
He was a bad dude for many a year.

4498
01:52:06,070 --> 01:52:09,370
I've seen some crazy shit happened
in fucking jet boxing gyms,

4499
01:52:09,371 --> 01:52:09,880
man.

4500
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:11,240
Crazy shit over the years.

4501
01:52:11,470 --> 01:52:12,370
That's incredible.

4502
01:52:12,460 --> 01:52:13,000
That's,

4503
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:13,830
would you ever hear

4504
01:52:13,830 --> 01:52:17,240
about the Floyd Mayweather thing where
like when he was dealing with those wrap

4505
01:52:17,241 --> 01:52:19,090
guys and they came in and beat guns,

4506
01:52:19,910 --> 01:52:20,690
people and Shit?

4507
01:52:20,690 --> 01:52:21,260
Yeah.

4508
01:52:21,260 --> 01:52:23,690
What was that all about
you again at one point?

4509
01:52:23,770 --> 01:52:24,261
You Fuck?

4510
01:52:24,261 --> 01:52:24,411
Yeah,

4511
01:52:24,411 --> 01:52:26,510
I remembered I wasn't there so I can't,

4512
01:52:26,511 --> 01:52:26,751
you know,

4513
01:52:26,751 --> 01:52:29,420
this isn't like right fucking
eye witness testimony,

4514
01:52:29,421 --> 01:52:30,254
but I,

4515
01:52:30,290 --> 01:52:34,520
I heard about it too and what I heard
was the dude that was managing him at the

4516
01:52:34,521 --> 01:52:36,710
time was like a hardcore,

4517
01:52:36,711 --> 01:52:38,730
like real dude and a,

4518
01:52:38,780 --> 01:52:40,130
and he didn't just walk into a gym.

4519
01:52:40,131 --> 01:52:44,960
I already walked into top rank their
gym pistol whipping people and fucking

4520
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:46,250
pulling out guns with Floyd

4521
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:49,430
and shit and kind of sets
just whatever their beef was.

4522
01:52:50,270 --> 01:52:51,230
Got It straightened out.

4523
01:52:52,230 --> 01:52:52,860
Yeah.

4524
01:52:52,860 --> 01:52:53,221
Box.

4525
01:52:53,221 --> 01:52:54,140
That's boxing man.

4526
01:52:54,170 --> 01:52:55,520
Racy fucking business.

4527
01:52:55,521 --> 01:52:56,250
That's boxing.

4528
01:52:56,250 --> 01:52:57,350
Here's the knockout right here.

4529
01:52:57,380 --> 01:52:58,370
Boxing is a crazy,

4530
01:52:58,371 --> 01:52:59,180
this is king mo.

4531
01:52:59,180 --> 01:53:00,530
Oh Shit.

4532
01:53:01,100 --> 01:53:02,870
He got spinning back fist.

4533
01:53:03,650 --> 01:53:05,030
Do you wish you had a look at,

4534
01:53:05,031 --> 01:53:05,864
wow.

4535
01:53:05,900 --> 01:53:07,510
Do you wish you had a
10 minute first round?

4536
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:08,121
Oh,

4537
01:53:08,121 --> 01:53:08,781
look at that.

4538
01:53:08,781 --> 01:53:09,321
Perfect.

4539
01:53:09,321 --> 01:53:10,310
Spinning back fist.

4540
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:10,611
Well,

4541
01:53:10,611 --> 01:53:12,950
you know what he's been playing with.

4542
01:53:12,951 --> 01:53:13,220
Uh,

4543
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:14,530
he's been doing a lot of boxing.

4544
01:53:14,770 --> 01:53:15,210
You know,

4545
01:53:15,210 --> 01:53:17,240
he's been training at Floyd's place.

4546
01:53:17,540 --> 01:53:18,650
He's been working with,

4547
01:53:18,651 --> 01:53:18,791
uh,

4548
01:53:18,791 --> 01:53:19,624
the Mayweathers.

4549
01:53:20,030 --> 01:53:20,450
That's,

4550
01:53:20,450 --> 01:53:21,740
that's great.

4551
01:53:21,741 --> 01:53:24,410
But you got to look out for
that spinning back fist to man,

4552
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:27,200
you gotta look out for these
crazy fucking techniques.

4553
01:53:27,230 --> 01:53:27,380
Okay,

4554
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:28,220
let me sleeping.

4555
01:53:28,430 --> 01:53:29,210
Yeah.

4556
01:53:29,210 --> 01:53:29,810
Wow.

4557
01:53:29,810 --> 01:53:31,730
Well that's a devastating technique.

4558
01:53:32,150 --> 01:53:33,680
There's so much torque into that.

4559
01:53:35,930 --> 01:53:37,480
That dude's Reddit rear naked choke on.

4560
01:53:37,481 --> 01:53:38,314
It was already out.

4561
01:53:39,110 --> 01:53:41,060
He's a bad ass where I
started to Kang Mile,

4562
01:53:41,540 --> 01:53:44,360
I thought that he was going to
have a very bright career in Mla.

4563
01:53:44,361 --> 01:53:45,890
I remember Brian,

4564
01:53:45,940 --> 01:53:46,081
well,

4565
01:53:46,081 --> 01:53:46,914
I still can.

4566
01:53:46,940 --> 01:53:49,190
Brian Parsons is a Ryan Parsons Rather.

4567
01:53:49,191 --> 01:53:50,740
Ryan Parsons is very high on that guy.

4568
01:53:50,741 --> 01:53:52,520
Just like unbelievable athlete.

4569
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:55,850
He said he'd never seen anybody just
throw around like real experience,

4570
01:53:55,851 --> 01:53:57,200
restless the way King Mo could.

4571
01:53:58,010 --> 01:53:58,221
Yeah.

4572
01:53:58,221 --> 01:54:00,920
When that whole thing went down with him
and we've sat down and talked one day

4573
01:54:00,921 --> 01:54:03,110
we'd never met and a smart guy though.

4574
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:04,191
Great Guy.

4575
01:54:04,191 --> 01:54:05,030
I like him a lot.

4576
01:54:05,031 --> 01:54:06,200
When you have a conversation with him,

4577
01:54:06,201 --> 01:54:07,310
he's actually a really smart guy.

4578
01:54:07,980 --> 01:54:09,650
Can ever have your hands down,

4579
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:11,870
can ever have your hands down like that.

4580
01:54:11,990 --> 01:54:14,000
You mean being cocky and being,

4581
01:54:14,001 --> 01:54:15,590
having a swagger and everything is great.

4582
01:54:15,591 --> 01:54:16,640
But man,

4583
01:54:16,641 --> 01:54:20,120
when a guy clip she on the channel and
I'll see it common to fucking the light.

4584
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:21,160
Shut off stuff.

4585
01:54:21,290 --> 01:54:23,570
Not a lot you can do about
the human body's design.

4586
01:54:23,660 --> 01:54:24,493
Yup.

4587
01:54:24,620 --> 01:54:25,220
I agree.

4588
01:54:25,220 --> 01:54:29,090
It's amazing how some guys could
just take ridiculous shots though.

4589
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:30,860
Some guys just take,

4590
01:54:31,010 --> 01:54:31,540
it's true.

4591
01:54:31,540 --> 01:54:33,050
I think if you're,

4592
01:54:33,110 --> 01:54:33,620
if you're,

4593
01:54:33,620 --> 01:54:35,240
it's one of those things
that you can't train.

4594
01:54:35,241 --> 01:54:36,050
You can't fucking do.

4595
01:54:36,050 --> 01:54:37,460
You either have a cin or you don't.

4596
01:54:37,490 --> 01:54:42,490
How about Fabio Maldonado and Glover
to sharer that crazy fucking file?

4597
01:54:43,130 --> 01:54:43,963
That was,

4598
01:54:43,970 --> 01:54:45,710
I had never seen anybody take,

4599
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:47,361
oh yeah.

4600
01:54:47,361 --> 01:54:48,080
Ridiculous.

4601
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:48,710
You know,

4602
01:54:48,710 --> 01:54:50,180
as long as that guy has been around,

4603
01:54:50,181 --> 01:54:50,691
as long as,

4604
01:54:50,691 --> 01:54:51,081
again,

4605
01:54:51,081 --> 01:54:53,930
when you talk about a guy
who's been a fucking war dog,

4606
01:54:53,931 --> 01:54:54,530
you know,

4607
01:54:54,530 --> 01:54:55,940
just 40 yeah.

4608
01:54:55,970 --> 01:54:57,500
40 years old and they still have it all.

4609
01:54:57,501 --> 01:54:58,550
Still have the punch of power,

4610
01:54:58,551 --> 01:54:59,560
still have the ability to,

4611
01:54:59,850 --> 01:55:01,370
to fight these guys at his age.

4612
01:55:01,371 --> 01:55:04,310
And He's also on testosterone
replacement therapy.

4613
01:55:04,340 --> 01:55:04,830
Right?

4614
01:55:04,830 --> 01:55:05,180
Yeah.

4615
01:55:05,180 --> 01:55:05,940
But you know,

4616
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:08,270
in that there is,

4617
01:55:08,271 --> 01:55:10,460
there's something in that as far
as longevity and staying around,

4618
01:55:10,461 --> 01:55:10,900
but Oh,

4619
01:55:10,900 --> 01:55:12,380
you're either fucking good or you're not.

4620
01:55:12,410 --> 01:55:12,531
Well,

4621
01:55:12,531 --> 01:55:13,364
he was awesome.

4622
01:55:13,390 --> 01:55:13,851
He had it.

4623
01:55:13,851 --> 01:55:16,700
But there's a lot of guys that are on
testosterone replacement therapy that

4624
01:55:16,701 --> 01:55:17,840
couldn't fight a fucking lick.

4625
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:18,411
That's true.

4626
01:55:18,411 --> 01:55:18,951
But it is a,

4627
01:55:18,951 --> 01:55:20,450
it's a funky subject now.

4628
01:55:20,451 --> 01:55:21,200
And that,

4629
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:22,040
I'm not a fan.

4630
01:55:22,690 --> 01:55:23,341
I'm not a,

4631
01:55:23,341 --> 01:55:23,991
you're not a fan.

4632
01:55:23,991 --> 01:55:24,111
No.

4633
01:55:24,111 --> 01:55:24,491
Because it,

4634
01:55:24,491 --> 01:55:26,540
it allows a guy like
Dan Henderson to fight.

4635
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:27,050
But if,

4636
01:55:27,050 --> 01:55:27,261
I mean,

4637
01:55:27,261 --> 01:55:31,190
if you've got a guy like Dan Henderson
is taking it responsibly and not,

4638
01:55:31,191 --> 01:55:34,180
not going over his limits
and the exact amount of,

4639
01:55:34,510 --> 01:55:35,540
that's what was going on.

4640
01:55:35,541 --> 01:55:36,030
Yeah.

4641
01:55:36,030 --> 01:55:36,500
But I,

4642
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:38,660
I truly believe that
that's not what's going on.

4643
01:55:39,290 --> 01:55:40,123
I agree.

4644
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:40,551
Well,

4645
01:55:40,551 --> 01:55:40,880
you know what,

4646
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:41,481
here's the problem.

4647
01:55:41,481 --> 01:55:44,460
This is what I've said before
about replacement therapy.

4648
01:55:44,670 --> 01:55:45,001
You know,

4649
01:55:45,001 --> 01:55:48,540
say he give a guy a bottle of whiskey
and you gave it to him and he said,

4650
01:55:48,541 --> 01:55:48,960
hey man,

4651
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,610
don't ever take more than one glass a day.

4652
01:55:50,611 --> 01:55:50,911
Okay,

4653
01:55:50,911 --> 01:55:51,750
here's the whole jug.

4654
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:53,330
What are the guys now like a hawk.

4655
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:54,300
But if he's indulgent,

4656
01:55:54,301 --> 01:55:55,200
what was he crazy guy?

4657
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:55,681
Well,

4658
01:55:55,681 --> 01:55:56,970
a lot of people were indulging.

4659
01:55:56,971 --> 01:55:58,290
When you take shit like that,

4660
01:55:58,410 --> 01:56:00,360
you feel like a fucking superhero man.

4661
01:56:00,361 --> 01:56:00,631
You're like,

4662
01:56:00,631 --> 01:56:01,200
wait a minute.

4663
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:01,980
Well not only that,

4664
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:04,380
but up just a little bit more and
let's pump it up a little bit more.

4665
01:56:04,381 --> 01:56:04,860
And,

4666
01:56:04,860 --> 01:56:08,610
and you taking self indulgent ridiculous
athletes who are fighters in the first

4667
01:56:08,611 --> 01:56:09,030
place.

4668
01:56:09,030 --> 01:56:10,620
They're crazy reckless motherfuckers.

4669
01:56:10,621 --> 01:56:11,041
And you're saying,

4670
01:56:11,041 --> 01:56:11,731
hey listen,

4671
01:56:11,731 --> 01:56:14,610
you just kind of a little jug of this
shit laying around and a couple of needles

4672
01:56:14,611 --> 01:56:15,450
and hey,

4673
01:56:15,451 --> 01:56:18,300
if there's only half the amount of
needles that are supposed to be here,

4674
01:56:18,301 --> 01:56:19,080
who cares?

4675
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:20,400
I'm your doctor.

4676
01:56:20,830 --> 01:56:21,241
Come on,

4677
01:56:21,241 --> 01:56:21,820
I love Ya.

4678
01:56:21,820 --> 01:56:23,310
Like watching a fight on TV.

4679
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:25,850
I love how these guys are
doctors by name on your shorts.

4680
01:56:25,860 --> 01:56:26,700
He's testosterone.

4681
01:56:26,701 --> 01:56:27,930
Guys are fucking doctors.

4682
01:56:27,940 --> 01:56:28,150
Write,

4683
01:56:28,150 --> 01:56:29,220
write a prescription for you.

4684
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:31,040
I want to write one on me now.

4685
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:35,490
Well it's hilarious that weed is illegal.

4686
01:56:35,670 --> 01:56:35,971
That,

4687
01:56:35,971 --> 01:56:38,100
I mean there's some people
that think that weed,

4688
01:56:38,170 --> 01:56:40,980
I've argued that weed is possibly
a performance enhancement.

4689
01:56:41,290 --> 01:56:41,630
Um,

4690
01:56:41,630 --> 01:56:43,080
w with people who smoke,

4691
01:56:43,081 --> 01:56:43,914
a lot of it,

4692
01:56:44,580 --> 01:56:48,030
every dude that I've ever known the
smokes weed turns into a fucking Zombie

4693
01:56:48,060 --> 01:56:49,200
after he smokes weed.

4694
01:56:49,650 --> 01:56:51,510
How could it be a
performance enhancing drug?

4695
01:56:51,540 --> 01:56:52,460
I love saying that.

4696
01:56:52,470 --> 01:56:56,220
Love with me and you're getting into this
shit cause I say that because I don't

4697
01:56:56,221 --> 01:56:57,740
know cause that's two
different types of wheat.

4698
01:56:57,741 --> 01:56:58,200
First of all,

4699
01:56:58,200 --> 01:56:59,580
there's Endeca and sativa.

4700
01:56:59,980 --> 01:57:02,730
Endeca is the far more
common style of weed.

4701
01:57:02,730 --> 01:57:03,750
And what that is is like,

4702
01:57:03,930 --> 01:57:04,763
it's known as like,

4703
01:57:05,010 --> 01:57:05,551
Oh gee,

4704
01:57:05,551 --> 01:57:07,020
Kush is what people usually cause.

4705
01:57:07,021 --> 01:57:09,030
That's like what snoop
Dogg smokest amazing goes

4706
01:57:11,130 --> 01:57:13,140
like real like mellow couch.

4707
01:57:13,141 --> 01:57:14,010
We'd right.

4708
01:57:14,190 --> 01:57:16,050
Then there's like Carl Sagan weed,

4709
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:17,131
Carl Sagan.

4710
01:57:17,131 --> 01:57:20,820
Weed is sativa and sativas much
more of like an upper type of weed.

4711
01:57:20,821 --> 01:57:22,260
It makes you want to watch documentaries,

4712
01:57:22,261 --> 01:57:23,094
makes you want to write.

4713
01:57:23,130 --> 01:57:26,010
It makes me want to go running
and makes you want to do things.

4714
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:27,810
A lot of people don't
understand that I've met,

4715
01:57:27,811 --> 01:57:28,501
I've never heard that.

4716
01:57:28,501 --> 01:57:29,550
Well it's harder to grow there.

4717
01:57:29,551 --> 01:57:31,650
There's South American
strains and they're,

4718
01:57:31,651 --> 01:57:31,951
they're,

4719
01:57:31,951 --> 01:57:33,810
they require a different growing cycle.

4720
01:57:33,811 --> 01:57:34,850
They would require their,

4721
01:57:34,860 --> 01:57:38,750
they're usually from
where the equator and the,

4722
01:57:38,810 --> 01:57:40,830
you can only grow them
in doors in America.

4723
01:57:41,550 --> 01:57:42,570
So when you're getting these,

4724
01:57:42,571 --> 01:57:42,901
these,

4725
01:57:42,901 --> 01:57:43,090
their,

4726
01:57:43,090 --> 01:57:43,341
their,

4727
01:57:43,341 --> 01:57:44,490
their low yield,

4728
01:57:44,610 --> 01:57:45,540
they don't yield as much,

4729
01:57:45,541 --> 01:57:47,940
they're harder to grow and you don't
get as much marijuana out of it.

4730
01:57:47,940 --> 01:57:49,320
So most of the stuff that you get,

4731
01:57:49,500 --> 01:57:51,810
it's like that sleepy
sort of narcotic wheat.

4732
01:57:51,930 --> 01:57:53,760
But the stuff that I get
is not like that at all.

4733
01:57:53,970 --> 01:57:54,751
Like that's why people say,

4734
01:57:54,751 --> 01:57:57,600
well you do so much shit and
you're a pothead or Sorta Yam.

4735
01:57:57,601 --> 01:57:58,440
Well first of all I'm not,

4736
01:57:58,500 --> 01:58:00,390
I take a lot of days off of smoking pot.

4737
01:58:00,391 --> 01:58:01,860
I don't believe in
doing anything everyday.

4738
01:58:02,010 --> 01:58:05,160
But the stuff that I smoke is not the
kind of stuff that makes you tired.

4739
01:58:05,490 --> 01:58:07,140
It's kind of stuff that
makes you think about shit.

4740
01:58:07,620 --> 01:58:09,130
It's kind of stuff that we're
going to give you free money.

4741
01:58:09,450 --> 01:58:10,190
Oh my gosh,

4742
01:58:10,190 --> 01:58:10,380
trait.

4743
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:12,270
You're writing the fuck out of
my fucking head would explode.

4744
01:58:12,271 --> 01:58:13,710
I think about too much shit already.

4745
01:58:13,711 --> 01:58:15,360
You do Bobby lying back,

4746
01:58:15,361 --> 01:58:16,830
looking at these constellations going,

4747
01:58:17,300 --> 01:58:18,210
what the fuck am I doing?

4748
01:58:18,211 --> 01:58:19,230
I'm going to find business.

4749
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:20,430
Do you wish,

4750
01:58:20,430 --> 01:58:20,530
uh,

4751
01:58:20,530 --> 01:58:21,570
daddy had the tooth,

4752
01:58:21,900 --> 01:58:22,740
you being a creep.

4753
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:24,000
Do you wish there was a,

4754
01:58:24,010 --> 01:58:24,320
uh,

4755
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:26,080
the first round tendons somewhere,

4756
01:58:26,110 --> 01:58:26,700
man,

4757
01:58:26,700 --> 01:58:27,020
sit down.

4758
01:58:27,020 --> 01:58:27,853
You fuck.

4759
01:58:28,230 --> 01:58:29,250
Stop wandering around.

4760
01:58:29,270 --> 01:58:29,461
Do you,

4761
01:58:29,461 --> 01:58:30,400
do you ever wish that,

4762
01:58:30,401 --> 01:58:30,690
that,

4763
01:58:30,690 --> 01:58:32,190
that you had to at first round,

4764
01:58:32,191 --> 01:58:33,540
now you're reading shit off the forms.

4765
01:58:33,570 --> 01:58:33,721
No.

4766
01:58:33,721 --> 01:58:34,600
This is something I,

4767
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:38,280
we talked about like two weeks ago and
I just wondered what Dana thought about

4768
01:58:38,281 --> 01:58:38,760
it.

4769
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:40,660
Do I ever wet wish that,

4770
01:58:40,710 --> 01:58:42,580
that you had a 10 minute first round?

4771
01:58:42,581 --> 01:58:44,140
Kind of like the old pride days.

4772
01:58:44,240 --> 01:58:45,100
I thought what they used to do.

4773
01:58:45,310 --> 01:58:45,730
No,

4774
01:58:45,730 --> 01:58:46,090
no,

4775
01:58:46,090 --> 01:58:46,271
no.

4776
01:58:46,271 --> 01:58:47,050
It's great for GAM.

4777
01:58:47,050 --> 01:58:48,160
For grapplers.

4778
01:58:48,210 --> 01:58:48,700
Yeah.

4779
01:58:48,700 --> 01:58:49,170
I liked,

4780
01:58:49,170 --> 01:58:50,560
I liked the structure where it is you get,

4781
01:58:50,561 --> 01:58:51,041
you get three,

4782
01:58:51,041 --> 01:58:52,000
five minute rounds or five,

4783
01:58:52,001 --> 01:58:52,840
five minute rounds.

4784
01:58:53,350 --> 01:58:54,183
Um,

4785
01:58:54,490 --> 01:58:55,181
do you like five,

4786
01:58:55,181 --> 01:58:56,710
five minute rounds for non title fight?

4787
01:58:56,711 --> 01:58:57,340
So yeah.

4788
01:58:57,340 --> 01:58:59,230
Do you feel like I do
if it's the main event,

4789
01:59:00,070 --> 01:59:00,281
you know,

4790
01:59:00,281 --> 01:59:03,980
and I think that's the real problem that
everybody had with Ronda Rousey be in

4791
01:59:03,990 --> 01:59:06,520
the May event is they wanted to see
Henderson but she did five rounds.

4792
01:59:06,730 --> 01:59:07,690
Well we were talking about,

4793
01:59:07,691 --> 01:59:08,680
and we didn't really finish it,

4794
01:59:08,681 --> 01:59:12,760
but the real issue with the testosterone
replacement therapy is that these guys

4795
01:59:12,910 --> 01:59:16,360
can take this shit and check
themselves up through the fucking roof.

4796
01:59:16,361 --> 01:59:16,600
Right.

4797
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:18,220
While they're whole trailer through,

4798
01:59:18,221 --> 01:59:18,670
through,

4799
01:59:18,670 --> 01:59:20,770
throughout training and suffer.

4800
01:59:21,070 --> 01:59:21,550
I mean there's a,

4801
01:59:21,550 --> 01:59:22,180
it's really,

4802
01:59:22,180 --> 01:59:25,270
they're not going to get any real problems
if they're just doing it for six to

4803
01:59:25,271 --> 01:59:25,781
eight weeks,

4804
01:59:25,781 --> 01:59:27,100
they're going to be fine if they do it.

4805
01:59:27,250 --> 01:59:29,920
So it's not like it's a dangerous
thing to them and the benefit is pretty

4806
01:59:29,921 --> 01:59:30,730
substantial.

4807
01:59:30,730 --> 01:59:32,110
The benefit as far as performance,

4808
01:59:32,111 --> 01:59:35,350
you get to hyper human levels and
as long as your body sustains,

4809
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:38,860
you don't cover faster flight
training session like that.

4810
01:59:38,861 --> 01:59:39,700
And that is a,

4811
01:59:39,701 --> 01:59:40,750
that's undeniable.

4812
01:59:40,870 --> 01:59:41,770
It's undeniable.

4813
01:59:41,771 --> 01:59:45,760
And when you look at some guys and you
see like the massive differences in their

4814
01:59:45,761 --> 01:59:47,320
physiques and that how,

4815
01:59:47,410 --> 01:59:48,340
how quickly,

4816
01:59:48,380 --> 01:59:48,621
you know,

4817
01:59:48,621 --> 01:59:49,361
like you look,

4818
01:59:49,361 --> 01:59:51,220
some of these guys you look at like,

4819
01:59:51,670 --> 01:59:52,660
I don't want to mention names,

4820
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:55,210
let's go with Vitara for his
last fight against Bisping.

4821
01:59:55,210 --> 01:59:56,590
He looked fucking fantastic,

4822
01:59:56,620 --> 01:59:56,890
right?

4823
01:59:56,890 --> 01:59:59,650
I mean you want to have a poster boy
for testosterone replacement therapy.

4824
01:59:59,860 --> 02:00:00,191
I'd be like,

4825
02:00:00,191 --> 02:00:01,270
whatever the fuck that guy's on,

4826
02:00:01,271 --> 02:00:02,090
give it to me.

4827
02:00:02,090 --> 02:00:03,070
It looks fantastic.

4828
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:03,280
All right.

4829
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:03,610
I mean,

4830
02:00:03,610 --> 02:00:04,443
and the weigh ins,

4831
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:06,550
well fucking shredded.

4832
02:00:06,970 --> 02:00:07,480
Perfect.

4833
02:00:07,480 --> 02:00:10,330
And the big question after that
fight was everybody's like,

4834
02:00:10,331 --> 02:00:11,620
is he going to pass the drug test?

4835
02:00:11,621 --> 02:00:12,880
Is he going to pass the drug test?

4836
02:00:12,910 --> 02:00:13,743
And he did.

4837
02:00:13,930 --> 02:00:14,410
He did.

4838
02:00:14,410 --> 02:00:15,450
But according to,

4839
02:00:15,990 --> 02:00:17,440
it's not even that he
passed the drug test.

4840
02:00:17,441 --> 02:00:18,910
I mean he was being monitored.

4841
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:19,390
Yes.

4842
02:00:19,390 --> 02:00:20,223
For the fight too.

4843
02:00:20,290 --> 02:00:23,650
Was he being monitored like all
throughout the camp to before,

4844
02:00:23,710 --> 02:00:24,460
two weeks before.

4845
02:00:24,460 --> 02:00:24,731
See,

4846
02:00:24,731 --> 02:00:26,140
but as long as they know when,

4847
02:00:26,170 --> 02:00:27,820
I mean I'm not accusing veto of anything,

4848
02:00:27,821 --> 02:00:32,821
but I'm saying that if a fighter was
like if he was willing to bend the rules,

4849
02:00:34,211 --> 02:00:36,370
as long as he knew when he
had to come in and Piss,

4850
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:38,830
it's not hard to super
elevate your levels.

4851
02:00:38,830 --> 02:00:39,431
That's one of the things,

4852
02:00:39,431 --> 02:00:40,840
I know you're not a fan of victor content,

4853
02:00:40,990 --> 02:00:45,160
but one of the things that he enlightened
beyond about drug testing is that the

4854
02:00:45,161 --> 02:00:49,090
actual benefits of the steroids
go far beyond the time we test.

4855
02:00:49,091 --> 02:00:51,880
Positive to tell you what I don't
like about Victor fucking Conti,

4856
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,380
this fucking piece of shit.

4857
02:00:53,381 --> 02:00:53,950
He's,

4858
02:00:53,950 --> 02:00:55,210
he's this fucking guy.

4859
02:00:55,240 --> 02:01:00,240
What I don't like about him is with the
tooth is over there like a fucking CIA

4860
02:01:00,251 --> 02:01:03,230
spy snapping pictures to
think through this as,

4861
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:03,860
yeah,

4862
02:01:03,860 --> 02:01:04,750
this is my life.

4863
02:01:04,990 --> 02:01:05,830
You have no idea.

4864
02:01:06,340 --> 02:01:10,270
So this fucking guy is the biggest
cheater in the history of fucking sports.

4865
02:01:10,271 --> 02:01:10,480
Yet.

4866
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:14,380
Now after he gets busted and fucking
rolls over and his buddies and shit wants

4867
02:01:14,381 --> 02:01:17,230
to come out and act like he's
trying to save fucking sports,

4868
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:17,681
do,

4869
02:01:17,681 --> 02:01:18,011
don't,

4870
02:01:18,011 --> 02:01:19,190
don't come out and start point,

4871
02:01:19,330 --> 02:01:22,600
come on my fucking Twitter and start
pointing your fucking finger at me and

4872
02:01:22,601 --> 02:01:23,020
saying,

4873
02:01:23,020 --> 02:01:23,201
oh,

4874
02:01:23,201 --> 02:01:25,750
the UFC isn't doing the fuck you.

4875
02:01:25,930 --> 02:01:26,081
Well,

4876
02:01:26,081 --> 02:01:28,540
the UFC does not have the
obligation to do that.

4877
02:01:28,541 --> 02:01:32,050
It's under the obligation of the Vata
State Athletic Commission to deregulate

4878
02:01:32,051 --> 02:01:34,330
and if they want to make
more stringent rules,

4879
02:01:34,331 --> 02:01:34,991
which they have.

4880
02:01:34,991 --> 02:01:36,220
I mean that's how they caught Overeem.

4881
02:01:36,370 --> 02:01:38,860
They decided to do some
random testing and that's how,

4882
02:01:38,861 --> 02:01:40,240
I mean there's a there,

4883
02:01:40,241 --> 02:01:41,510
there's obviously been some,

4884
02:01:41,511 --> 02:01:44,710
some movement May to try to regulate
certain certain aspects of a,

4885
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:45,553
of MMA,

4886
02:01:45,740 --> 02:01:46,290
but

4887
02:01:46,290 --> 02:01:48,750
and our fighters are
fighters get hot fought.

4888
02:01:48,870 --> 02:01:50,640
The consequences are huge.

4889
02:01:50,670 --> 02:01:51,481
Are huge.

4890
02:01:51,481 --> 02:01:52,740
A year of no work.

4891
02:01:52,770 --> 02:01:53,341
Exactly.

4892
02:01:53,341 --> 02:01:53,540
Yeah.

4893
02:01:53,540 --> 02:01:54,330
That's it.

4894
02:01:54,330 --> 02:01:58,170
That's what I just don't think the media
and some of the fans really wrapped

4895
02:01:58,171 --> 02:01:59,260
their fucking brains around.

4896
02:01:59,340 --> 02:01:59,520
Yeah,

4897
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:00,480
it's devastating.

4898
02:02:00,510 --> 02:02:02,040
It's devastating for your confidence.

4899
02:02:02,041 --> 02:02:03,090
It's devastating for your career.

4900
02:02:03,091 --> 02:02:04,830
You've got to answer
questions everywhere you go.

4901
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:05,821
It's a huge,

4902
02:02:05,821 --> 02:02:06,091
huge,

4903
02:02:06,091 --> 02:02:06,751
huge loss.

4904
02:02:06,751 --> 02:02:08,400
And if it happens again,

4905
02:02:08,550 --> 02:02:09,090
boy,

4906
02:02:09,090 --> 02:02:10,180
then you're really fucked.

4907
02:02:10,440 --> 02:02:11,580
Then you really fucked.

4908
02:02:11,581 --> 02:02:13,260
And domains are substantial as well.

4909
02:02:13,680 --> 02:02:15,040
Don't you lose your wind bonkers?

4910
02:02:15,100 --> 02:02:15,800
You lose.

4911
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:16,110
Yeah.

4912
02:02:16,110 --> 02:02:17,310
You lose your win bonus.

4913
02:02:17,370 --> 02:02:18,000
Yeah.

4914
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:19,890
So imagine that happening in football.

4915
02:02:20,300 --> 02:02:21,240
Oh my baseball.

4916
02:02:21,420 --> 02:02:22,920
As much as it can happen in MMA,

4917
02:02:22,921 --> 02:02:24,480
if you're being regulated
by the government,

4918
02:02:24,870 --> 02:02:25,081
well,

4919
02:02:25,081 --> 02:02:28,350
the football thing is ridiculous because
there's no way you get humans that big

4920
02:02:28,351 --> 02:02:29,280
unless they're doing something.

4921
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:29,881
I mean,

4922
02:02:29,881 --> 02:02:30,750
everybody knows it.

4923
02:02:30,780 --> 02:02:30,980
I mean,

4924
02:02:30,980 --> 02:02:32,340
I have a friend who,

4925
02:02:32,341 --> 02:02:32,640
uh,

4926
02:02:32,640 --> 02:02:35,660
was a in competitive high
school football and uh,

4927
02:02:35,670 --> 02:02:36,271
he's now,

4928
02:02:36,271 --> 02:02:37,890
he's a a technician.

4929
02:02:37,891 --> 02:02:39,810
Like he say I'm an it guy,

4930
02:02:40,110 --> 02:02:40,890
brilliant guy.

4931
02:02:40,890 --> 02:02:42,930
But he told me they were giving
him steroids in high school.

4932
02:02:43,070 --> 02:02:43,680
All right.

4933
02:02:43,680 --> 02:02:44,161
He goes,

4934
02:02:44,161 --> 02:02:44,850
I was,

4935
02:02:44,850 --> 02:02:45,151
he goes,

4936
02:02:45,151 --> 02:02:46,530
I was a competitive football player.

4937
02:02:46,531 --> 02:02:46,921
And they were,

4938
02:02:46,921 --> 02:02:47,850
they were giving me steroids.

4939
02:02:47,970 --> 02:02:48,421
I was like,

4940
02:02:48,421 --> 02:02:49,021
how old were you?

4941
02:02:49,021 --> 02:02:49,291
He was like,

4942
02:02:49,291 --> 02:02:50,124
I was 17.

4943
02:02:50,130 --> 02:02:50,431
I was like,

4944
02:02:50,431 --> 02:02:51,390
that's fucking crazy.

4945
02:02:51,391 --> 02:02:52,650
Who else in your team was on steroids?

4946
02:02:52,651 --> 02:02:52,831
He goes,

4947
02:02:52,831 --> 02:02:53,760
we were all on steroids.

4948
02:02:54,060 --> 02:02:54,391
I go,

4949
02:02:54,391 --> 02:02:57,270
what the fuck are you saying your
coach was giving you steroids?

4950
02:02:57,271 --> 02:02:57,511
He goes,

4951
02:02:57,511 --> 02:02:57,721
yeah,

4952
02:02:57,721 --> 02:02:57,961
he goes,

4953
02:02:57,961 --> 02:02:58,950
we were in a serious,

4954
02:02:58,951 --> 02:03:01,240
like it was a very
competitive team and the,

4955
02:03:01,241 --> 02:03:04,620
they let us know what we needed to do
if we wanted to get bigger and stronger

4956
02:03:04,740 --> 02:03:05,401
and we're all like,

4957
02:03:05,401 --> 02:03:06,220
what?

4958
02:03:06,220 --> 02:03:06,941
Like you get you got it.

4959
02:03:06,941 --> 02:03:08,240
And so like when you're 16,

4960
02:03:08,250 --> 02:03:09,480
17 your coach says,

4961
02:03:09,510 --> 02:03:10,343
do you want steroids?

4962
02:03:10,430 --> 02:03:10,730
Um,

4963
02:03:10,730 --> 02:03:11,100
yeah,

4964
02:03:11,100 --> 02:03:11,730
coach,

4965
02:03:11,730 --> 02:03:12,563
I want to win

4966
02:03:13,070 --> 02:03:14,150
Vegas during high school.

4967
02:03:14,151 --> 02:03:15,920
And when I was in high school,

4968
02:03:16,100 --> 02:03:17,150
it was a doctor in town.

4969
02:03:17,151 --> 02:03:18,770
You went and got in his
weight grading program,

4970
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:20,570
weight gain program,

4971
02:03:20,571 --> 02:03:21,080
they call it.

4972
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:21,913
And what did they do?

4973
02:03:22,130 --> 02:03:22,431
They would,

4974
02:03:22,431 --> 02:03:24,740
they would give you injections and pills.

4975
02:03:25,130 --> 02:03:27,860
You told both shots and
pills in high school.

4976
02:03:29,390 --> 02:03:30,223
That crazy

4977
02:03:30,530 --> 02:03:31,363
shit.

4978
02:03:31,370 --> 02:03:32,830
I had a kid that I went to
high school with and went,

4979
02:03:32,850 --> 02:03:33,683
that was on roids.

4980
02:03:34,040 --> 02:03:34,491
He was,

4981
02:03:34,491 --> 02:03:34,790
um,

4982
02:03:34,790 --> 02:03:35,600
I don't want to say his name.

4983
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:37,820
Very nice guy turned I.

4984
02:03:37,820 --> 02:03:38,601
Years later I saw him and he says,

4985
02:03:38,601 --> 02:03:39,431
shit shriveled up.

4986
02:03:39,431 --> 02:03:40,820
He weighs like 160 pounds now.

4987
02:03:40,821 --> 02:03:41,960
But when we were in high school,

4988
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:44,210
everybody was terrified at this kid.

4989
02:03:44,390 --> 02:03:45,470
He was like

4990
02:03:47,180 --> 02:03:48,440
250 pounds.

4991
02:03:48,441 --> 02:03:49,400
Five foot seven.

4992
02:03:49,460 --> 02:03:49,881
Okay.

4993
02:03:49,881 --> 02:03:51,710
Who was fucking maybe five,

4994
02:03:51,711 --> 02:03:53,600
eight Jai Gantt tick.

4995
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:56,870
I mean just shooed stretch
marks all over his chest.

4996
02:03:56,871 --> 02:03:58,130
His arms were enormous.

4997
02:03:58,131 --> 02:03:59,930
I don't know what he was taken,

4998
02:04:00,140 --> 02:04:03,380
but he was on some super
hyper elevated levels.

4999
02:04:03,381 --> 02:04:07,070
He was playing football and this guy
just juiced it to the gills and everybody

5000
02:04:07,071 --> 02:04:07,880
kind of knew.

5001
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:10,420
But it was not a like fucking
the eighties man ever.

5002
02:04:10,460 --> 02:04:11,211
No one else there.

5003
02:04:11,211 --> 02:04:11,390
Right.

5004
02:04:11,390 --> 02:04:11,901
But this was,

5005
02:04:11,901 --> 02:04:12,770
I was in high school.

5006
02:04:12,860 --> 02:04:14,750
We didn't know anybody
else that was doing it.

5007
02:04:14,780 --> 02:04:15,500
How old are you?

5008
02:04:15,500 --> 02:04:20,210
I am 45 45 so I graduated
in [inaudible] 85 87.

5009
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:21,590
This guy was,

5010
02:04:21,890 --> 02:04:24,050
he was a year older than me and um,

5011
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:26,810
he was on the football team and
everybody knew that he was on steroids,

5012
02:04:26,811 --> 02:04:28,370
but no one else knew anybody else.

5013
02:04:28,371 --> 02:04:31,490
It wasn't like there was like a
whole epidemic of people on steroids,

5014
02:04:31,670 --> 02:04:35,360
but there was this one guy that was
just unbelievably ridiculously big and

5015
02:04:35,361 --> 02:04:37,470
aggressive and he like,

5016
02:04:37,480 --> 02:04:38,080
he kept it

5017
02:04:38,080 --> 02:04:41,590
up for like a few years and then just got
off the shit and just shriveled up til

5018
02:04:41,591 --> 02:04:42,424
like nothing.

5019
02:04:42,550 --> 02:04:43,241
And everybody's like,

5020
02:04:43,241 --> 02:04:44,920
what the fuck happened?

5021
02:04:45,100 --> 02:04:46,630
And he didn't really talk about it.

5022
02:04:46,631 --> 02:04:47,190
And it was,

5023
02:04:47,190 --> 02:04:48,370
it was very strange.

5024
02:04:48,610 --> 02:04:50,110
But for a short period of time,

5025
02:04:50,111 --> 02:04:55,111
this 17 year old kid was 200 fucking and
whatever pounds of just shredded muscle

5026
02:04:55,361 --> 02:04:56,380
coming out of his head.

5027
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:59,650
I mean it was incredible what they
were willing to do to this kid

5028
02:04:59,900 --> 02:05:01,550
that was like that in Vegas.

5029
02:05:02,120 --> 02:05:02,540
Every,

5030
02:05:02,540 --> 02:05:05,210
every single school in Vegas
was competitive with football.

5031
02:05:05,211 --> 02:05:05,391
Man.

5032
02:05:05,391 --> 02:05:07,400
They say it's a real issue with
high school kids these days,

5033
02:05:07,430 --> 02:05:08,450
cause they know about it.

5034
02:05:08,510 --> 02:05:10,430
Especially football players,

5035
02:05:10,431 --> 02:05:10,671
man,

5036
02:05:10,671 --> 02:05:11,900
kids who played football,

5037
02:05:12,300 --> 02:05:13,120
you know,

5038
02:05:13,120 --> 02:05:15,050
it just being bigger as being better.

5039
02:05:15,350 --> 02:05:15,681
Yeah.

5040
02:05:15,681 --> 02:05:16,370
That's a,

5041
02:05:16,370 --> 02:05:18,500
and there's a real lottery in that.

5042
02:05:18,501 --> 02:05:18,831
I mean,

5043
02:05:18,831 --> 02:05:22,850
if you're a an impoverished kid
in a bad community and you can,

5044
02:05:22,851 --> 02:05:23,121
you know,

5045
02:05:23,121 --> 02:05:23,751
if you're big,

5046
02:05:23,751 --> 02:05:25,580
you're six foot four and
you could fucking run man,

5047
02:05:25,610 --> 02:05:26,371
Jesus Christ,

5048
02:05:26,371 --> 02:05:26,760
you know,

5049
02:05:26,760 --> 02:05:27,290
football's you.

5050
02:05:27,290 --> 02:05:28,123
Your big ticket.

5051
02:05:28,670 --> 02:05:29,503
Sure is.

5052
02:05:29,960 --> 02:05:30,230
Yeah.

5053
02:05:30,230 --> 02:05:31,640
For every football,

5054
02:05:31,641 --> 02:05:32,570
go to a good high school,

5055
02:05:32,571 --> 02:05:33,570
you go to a good college,

5056
02:05:33,571 --> 02:05:34,311
you go to good college,

5057
02:05:34,311 --> 02:05:37,310
maybe can go to the NFL or at least
get an education and it's just,

5058
02:05:37,820 --> 02:05:38,930
there's so much at stake.

5059
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:39,250
One of the

5060
02:05:39,250 --> 02:05:44,250
craziest things I've ever heard about
football is that 80% of the NFL players

5061
02:05:44,921 --> 02:05:47,230
are bankrupt within two years of retiring.

5062
02:05:47,770 --> 02:05:50,680
80% and 60% of NBA players,

5063
02:05:51,700 --> 02:05:55,710
80% and you deal with the,

5064
02:05:55,720 --> 02:05:57,930
the impacts of head impacts and football.

5065
02:05:58,060 --> 02:05:59,290
Like there's,

5066
02:05:59,410 --> 02:06:02,200
there's certainly head impacts in MMA,

5067
02:06:02,350 --> 02:06:07,350
but the head impacts and football are
dudes running at each other running full

5068
02:06:07,811 --> 02:06:08,231
clip,

5069
02:06:08,231 --> 02:06:10,900
300 pound men slamming into each other,

5070
02:06:11,020 --> 02:06:12,250
run as fast as track stars.

5071
02:06:12,280 --> 02:06:14,010
Oh yeah.

5072
02:06:14,170 --> 02:06:16,630
Spiking each other in the fucking head.

5073
02:06:17,050 --> 02:06:18,520
He'll go and helmet to helmet.

5074
02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:19,180
Yeah,

5075
02:06:19,180 --> 02:06:20,210
lightened each other up.

5076
02:06:20,230 --> 02:06:21,340
My son plays football.

5077
02:06:21,341 --> 02:06:22,040
My son's a quarter,

5078
02:06:22,040 --> 02:06:23,080
my both my sons do.

5079
02:06:23,170 --> 02:06:24,780
Once a quarter back.

5080
02:06:26,110 --> 02:06:27,190
The other one plays defense.

5081
02:06:27,191 --> 02:06:27,710
Yeah.

5082
02:06:27,710 --> 02:06:28,511
People always ask me,

5083
02:06:28,511 --> 02:06:28,990
I'm like,

5084
02:06:28,990 --> 02:06:31,390
I'd rather have my kids fight.

5085
02:06:31,391 --> 02:06:31,940
Fight.

5086
02:06:31,940 --> 02:06:32,760
Yeah I would.

5087
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:33,430
And they do.

5088
02:06:33,430 --> 02:06:34,091
They fight too,

5089
02:06:34,091 --> 02:06:35,620
but I'd rather fight then.

5090
02:06:36,160 --> 02:06:36,461
Then,

5091
02:06:36,461 --> 02:06:36,880
uh,

5092
02:06:36,880 --> 02:06:37,541
then play football.

5093
02:06:37,541 --> 02:06:37,741
What did,

5094
02:06:37,741 --> 02:06:37,851
what,

5095
02:06:37,851 --> 02:06:38,684
what are you going to do?

5096
02:06:38,920 --> 02:06:39,181
My,

5097
02:06:39,181 --> 02:06:41,410
my oldest son is a lunatic.

5098
02:06:41,830 --> 02:06:43,150
It's all he cares about his football.

5099
02:06:43,151 --> 02:06:43,961
It's all he wants to do.

5100
02:06:43,961 --> 02:06:44,830
It's all he cares about.

5101
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:45,930
Has he had anything?

5102
02:06:45,930 --> 02:06:46,900
Can get that from me.

5103
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:47,351
You know,

5104
02:06:47,351 --> 02:06:47,561
it,

5105
02:06:47,561 --> 02:06:48,580
it's just what he loves.

5106
02:06:48,581 --> 02:06:49,414
Has he had any cash?

5107
02:06:49,450 --> 02:06:50,200
Not that I'm aware of.

5108
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:50,381
No.

5109
02:06:50,381 --> 02:06:50,860
Yeah.

5110
02:06:50,860 --> 02:06:52,390
Do you know that there's been,

5111
02:06:52,410 --> 02:06:52,750
um,

5112
02:06:52,750 --> 02:06:53,501
I know you love,

5113
02:06:53,501 --> 02:06:54,300
you're gambling.

5114
02:06:54,300 --> 02:06:55,230
You're a crazy gamble.

5115
02:06:55,420 --> 02:06:56,253
Fuck right.

5116
02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:59,860
Do you know that there's a
direct correlation between
gambling and brain damage?

5117
02:07:00,570 --> 02:07:00,960
Yeah.

5118
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:01,710
Well,

5119
02:07:01,710 --> 02:07:02,580
that's funny you say that.

5120
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:04,440
Do you ever thought about that?

5121
02:07:04,470 --> 02:07:04,741
Yeah.

5122
02:07:04,741 --> 02:07:04,951
No.

5123
02:07:04,951 --> 02:07:05,671
W W you know,

5124
02:07:05,671 --> 02:07:06,071
it was funny.

5125
02:07:06,071 --> 02:07:06,850
It was when I went to,

5126
02:07:06,850 --> 02:07:07,530
uh,

5127
02:07:07,530 --> 02:07:07,891
you know,

5128
02:07:07,891 --> 02:07:09,540
when that whole Tito thing was happening,

5129
02:07:10,020 --> 02:07:12,030
I had to go in and get full medicals done.

5130
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:13,080
So,

5131
02:07:13,080 --> 02:07:13,401
you know,

5132
02:07:13,401 --> 02:07:14,140
from I,

5133
02:07:14,140 --> 02:07:15,750
I the only times I've
been punched in the head,

5134
02:07:16,260 --> 02:07:16,680
you know,

5135
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:17,190
probably a lot,

5136
02:07:17,190 --> 02:07:18,290
a lot and not,

5137
02:07:18,300 --> 02:07:18,720
you know,

5138
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:19,950
I went in and I did have,

5139
02:07:20,190 --> 02:07:21,420
I had spots on my brain.

5140
02:07:22,630 --> 02:07:22,920
Yeah.

5141
02:07:22,920 --> 02:07:24,270
So when uh,

5142
02:07:24,300 --> 02:07:25,110
what does that mean?

5143
02:07:25,110 --> 02:07:25,621
It's just,

5144
02:07:25,621 --> 02:07:25,831
you know,

5145
02:07:25,831 --> 02:07:29,190
it's trauma that's damage that's
been done to you from being punched,

5146
02:07:29,250 --> 02:07:30,010
you know,

5147
02:07:30,010 --> 02:07:31,850
and whether you play football,

5148
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:32,360
you've,

5149
02:07:32,360 --> 02:07:32,671
you know,

5150
02:07:32,671 --> 02:07:35,290
you boxed or you did mixed
martial arts or whatever it is.

5151
02:07:35,291 --> 02:07:36,220
Any type of blows

5152
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:37,053
to the head.

5153
02:07:37,120 --> 02:07:39,340
Prolonged blows to the head for years.

5154
02:07:39,550 --> 02:07:44,550
So I was getting punched in the head
till I was 31 years old then I didn't do

5155
02:07:46,331 --> 02:07:49,660
any anything for maybe
three or four years.

5156
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:51,190
And then I'll tell you what man,

5157
02:07:51,191 --> 02:07:51,851
getting ready for that.

5158
02:07:51,851 --> 02:07:54,280
Tito fight fucked me up bad man.

5159
02:07:54,350 --> 02:07:55,140
I really

5160
02:07:55,140 --> 02:07:55,951
well you were sparring.

5161
02:07:55,951 --> 02:07:56,940
I really hurt myself.

5162
02:07:56,941 --> 02:07:58,830
A lot of people don't even
know what that was like.

5163
02:07:58,831 --> 02:08:00,750
You had made some sort
of a deal with Tito.

5164
02:08:00,751 --> 02:08:01,740
If you resigned them,

5165
02:08:01,741 --> 02:08:03,060
you would like box him.

5166
02:08:03,110 --> 02:08:07,200
Peto put in the contract that if he
came back and we did this new deal,

5167
02:08:07,201 --> 02:08:11,190
part of the deal was that me and
him had to fight in a boxing match.

5168
02:08:11,191 --> 02:08:12,480
Three three minute rounds.

5169
02:08:12,990 --> 02:08:15,120
So you agreed to it and
then you started training.

5170
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:16,170
I remember you were,

5171
02:08:16,200 --> 02:08:18,420
you were still managing the UFC,

5172
02:08:18,470 --> 02:08:18,660
right?

5173
02:08:18,660 --> 02:08:21,960
And you are bringing guys out with you
and you were telling me about these

5174
02:08:21,961 --> 02:08:25,910
fucking wars that you would get any
sparring sessions with these animals like

5175
02:08:25,911 --> 02:08:26,490
the wheel.

5176
02:08:26,490 --> 02:08:26,701
Yeah,

5177
02:08:26,701 --> 02:08:27,750
I brought in heavyweights.

5178
02:08:27,780 --> 02:08:29,910
I brought him real heavyweights guys,

5179
02:08:29,911 --> 02:08:30,600
boxers,

5180
02:08:30,600 --> 02:08:32,070
real heavyweight kit kids that were,

5181
02:08:32,300 --> 02:08:32,750
you know,

5182
02:08:32,750 --> 02:08:33,870
there was one kid that,

5183
02:08:34,940 --> 02:08:35,290
huh?

5184
02:08:35,290 --> 02:08:37,860
How was 37 I was 37 when I did this.

5185
02:08:37,861 --> 02:08:38,101
Dude,

5186
02:08:38,101 --> 02:08:39,150
I'm telling you right now,

5187
02:08:40,020 --> 02:08:41,700
I'd be sitting on my fucking office,

5188
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:42,593
right?

5189
02:08:42,850 --> 02:08:43,683
And I kept,

5190
02:08:43,760 --> 02:08:48,060
she remember that's the movie three
o'clock I with the kids going to kick the

5191
02:08:48,061 --> 02:08:49,230
dude's ass after school.

5192
02:08:49,740 --> 02:08:51,690
He's trying to get out of
fucking getting his ass kicked.

5193
02:08:52,170 --> 02:08:53,110
I'd be looking at the clock.

5194
02:08:53,111 --> 02:08:53,311
I go,

5195
02:08:53,311 --> 02:08:53,990
oh my God,

5196
02:08:53,990 --> 02:08:54,240
fuck,

5197
02:08:54,240 --> 02:08:55,073
I'm on the clock.

5198
02:08:55,170 --> 02:08:58,710
Those dudes are going to be here in two
hours because I would spar three o'clock

5199
02:08:58,711 --> 02:09:00,510
and I sparred every fucking day.

5200
02:09:00,830 --> 02:09:01,800
I'm in the middle of,

5201
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:02,191
at once.

5202
02:09:02,191 --> 02:09:04,830
I got in shape and uh,

5203
02:09:04,950 --> 02:09:06,420
I was sparring with these heavy real,

5204
02:09:06,540 --> 02:09:06,991
we brought,

5205
02:09:06,991 --> 02:09:10,440
we brought in professional boxers that
it was foreign with and I'm telling you,

5206
02:09:10,441 --> 02:09:11,130
man,

5207
02:09:11,130 --> 02:09:14,670
I fucking then the day
for me to get my license,

5208
02:09:14,970 --> 02:09:16,110
for me to get my license,

5209
02:09:16,111 --> 02:09:18,330
the commission had to see me box.

5210
02:09:19,140 --> 02:09:21,900
So they want to know who I
was boxing with that day.

5211
02:09:21,901 --> 02:09:23,610
So I brought in this kid,

5212
02:09:23,630 --> 02:09:24,463
uh,

5213
02:09:24,520 --> 02:09:25,050
uh,

5214
02:09:25,050 --> 02:09:25,890
this heavyweight,

5215
02:09:26,130 --> 02:09:27,870
I'm going to have to ask
Kipper Kelp what his name was,

5216
02:09:27,871 --> 02:09:28,890
but he's still fighting today.

5217
02:09:28,900 --> 02:09:29,700
He just fought for,

5218
02:09:29,700 --> 02:09:30,151
I think he,

5219
02:09:30,151 --> 02:09:30,730
uh,

5220
02:09:30,730 --> 02:09:31,201
he was,

5221
02:09:31,201 --> 02:09:31,790
uh,

5222
02:09:31,790 --> 02:09:34,290
I think he's ranked number
six in the world right now.

5223
02:09:34,710 --> 02:09:39,330
And this kid came in and that the kid
I sparred with that day and we had a

5224
02:09:39,331 --> 02:09:42,930
fucking war because the commission was
watching and I wanted to make sure these

5225
02:09:42,931 --> 02:09:46,320
guys gave me an license and this
dude wasn't taking it easy on.

5226
02:09:46,321 --> 02:09:47,700
This guy was fucking putting it to me.

5227
02:09:48,270 --> 02:09:48,571
I was like,

5228
02:09:48,571 --> 02:09:49,770
what the fuck is this guy doing?

5229
02:09:49,771 --> 02:09:50,940
Is he trying to kill me right now?

5230
02:09:50,941 --> 02:09:53,190
Is He's trying to make
me knock at the license.

5231
02:09:53,191 --> 02:09:54,030
So I said fuck it.

5232
02:09:54,420 --> 02:09:57,150
We got to go all out of here are these
guys aren't gonna fucking license.

5233
02:09:57,150 --> 02:09:58,440
So he was trying to show off.

5234
02:09:58,470 --> 02:09:58,970
They didn't come,

5235
02:09:58,970 --> 02:10:00,420
they didn't want to license me anyway.

5236
02:10:00,780 --> 02:10:01,650
I mean this whole thing,

5237
02:10:02,520 --> 02:10:07,440
I really kind of got a bad relationship
with some of the commissioners through

5238
02:10:07,441 --> 02:10:09,240
me getting this license to fight Tito.

5239
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:10,560
It wasn't a good thing.

5240
02:10:11,010 --> 02:10:13,080
So we had a fucking war that day.

5241
02:10:13,081 --> 02:10:13,914
Me and this guy,

5242
02:10:14,370 --> 02:10:16,560
I mean fucking dropping
bombs on each other,

5243
02:10:16,590 --> 02:10:17,423
right?

5244
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:19,470
So when it was over,

5245
02:10:19,471 --> 02:10:24,090
my nose was so fucked up after getting
ready for that Tito fight that I had to

5246
02:10:24,091 --> 02:10:28,170
go have surgery and I snore like a beast.

5247
02:10:28,260 --> 02:10:29,790
And I don't know if you can
tell when you look at me,

5248
02:10:29,791 --> 02:10:33,000
I got like red lines seems like the
red lines and outside of my nose.

5249
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:35,150
I don't know why the fuck that there,

5250
02:10:35,151 --> 02:10:37,910
but it didn't use to be there
and now I snore like crazy.

5251
02:10:37,911 --> 02:10:38,750
I already had a surgery.

5252
02:10:38,751 --> 02:10:39,580
The surgery didn't,

5253
02:10:39,580 --> 02:10:40,430
that didn't work.

5254
02:10:40,431 --> 02:10:41,180
It was like,

5255
02:10:41,180 --> 02:10:41,541
but man,

5256
02:10:41,541 --> 02:10:42,374
that Tito thing

5257
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:43,313
you will use.

5258
02:10:43,350 --> 02:10:44,670
That was my last Hurrah.

5259
02:10:44,820 --> 02:10:47,040
You had deviated septum
surgery and it didn't work.

5260
02:10:47,070 --> 02:10:47,850
Didn't work,

5261
02:10:47,850 --> 02:10:48,270
man.

5262
02:10:48,270 --> 02:10:49,200
Mine were great.

5263
02:10:49,260 --> 02:10:51,330
I had a great doctor
and glad to hear that.

5264
02:10:51,380 --> 02:10:51,800
Oh,

5265
02:10:51,800 --> 02:10:52,591
it's amazing.

5266
02:10:52,591 --> 02:10:53,251
Mine sucked.

5267
02:10:53,251 --> 02:10:54,750
Actually knows wider though.

5268
02:10:54,751 --> 02:10:55,231
It's funny.

5269
02:10:55,231 --> 02:10:56,400
I like looking at photos.

5270
02:10:56,401 --> 02:10:56,941
Makes Sense.

5271
02:10:56,941 --> 02:10:58,140
Something they like,

5272
02:10:58,141 --> 02:11:01,830
why didn't my know something
that's so much better,

5273
02:11:01,831 --> 02:11:02,191
man.

5274
02:11:02,191 --> 02:11:04,980
I go back to how it used
to be most of my life.

5275
02:11:04,981 --> 02:11:06,240
I couldn't breathe out of my nose.

5276
02:11:06,500 --> 02:11:06,840
Yeah.

5277
02:11:06,840 --> 02:11:08,280
I broke my nose when I was five.

5278
02:11:08,281 --> 02:11:12,090
I fell down a flight of stairs and
from then a lifetime of martial arts,

5279
02:11:12,091 --> 02:11:13,230
boxing and wrestling.

5280
02:11:13,380 --> 02:11:14,550
It was just mashed.

5281
02:11:14,551 --> 02:11:17,730
It was just the inside was all fucked
up and yours is still like that.

5282
02:11:18,150 --> 02:11:18,961
I'd go in again,

5283
02:11:18,961 --> 02:11:19,231
man.

5284
02:11:19,231 --> 02:11:20,310
I'd get a better doctor.

5285
02:11:20,430 --> 02:11:22,050
I'm done with surgery is fuck that shit.

5286
02:11:22,100 --> 02:11:22,990
He'll snore.

5287
02:11:23,120 --> 02:11:23,610
Fuck it.

5288
02:11:23,610 --> 02:11:24,990
I'm going to get the
mouthpiece like you told me.

5289
02:11:24,991 --> 02:11:25,950
I keep saying I'm going to do it.

5290
02:11:25,951 --> 02:11:26,731
I just need that.

5291
02:11:26,731 --> 02:11:26,881
Yeah,

5292
02:11:26,881 --> 02:11:27,211
you don't.

5293
02:11:27,211 --> 02:11:28,260
You have a sleep apnea too?

5294
02:11:28,290 --> 02:11:28,411
Yeah,

5295
02:11:28,411 --> 02:11:29,101
I got it bad.

5296
02:11:29,101 --> 02:11:30,270
I don't sleep at all bro.

5297
02:11:30,360 --> 02:11:31,380
I don't sleep at all.

5298
02:11:31,590 --> 02:11:32,221
You need to sleep.

5299
02:11:32,221 --> 02:11:33,054
He can die.

5300
02:11:33,310 --> 02:11:34,290
Shit ain't good for your heart,

5301
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:34,830
son.

5302
02:11:34,830 --> 02:11:35,430
I know.

5303
02:11:35,430 --> 02:11:36,263
What are you doing?

5304
02:11:36,430 --> 02:11:36,960
I'm on.

5305
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:37,830
We're all getting money now.

5306
02:11:37,831 --> 02:11:38,440
You've got resources.

5307
02:11:38,440 --> 02:11:39,160
We're all going to die.

5308
02:11:39,160 --> 02:11:39,371
Yeah.

5309
02:11:39,371 --> 02:11:40,440
We don't have to die this way.

5310
02:11:42,480 --> 02:11:44,190
Drinking some green shit over there.

5311
02:11:44,191 --> 02:11:46,560
You must be at least
thinking about your health.

5312
02:11:46,970 --> 02:11:47,290
You,

5313
02:11:47,290 --> 02:11:49,500
you've basically worrying about your diet.

5314
02:11:49,880 --> 02:11:50,220
Yeah.

5315
02:11:50,220 --> 02:11:50,521
Yeah,

5316
02:11:50,521 --> 02:11:51,140
I got it.

5317
02:11:51,140 --> 02:11:52,500
I'm on this diet because of the ear.

5318
02:11:53,310 --> 02:11:53,851
What does it do?

5319
02:11:53,851 --> 02:11:54,620
What does the uh,

5320
02:11:54,620 --> 02:11:56,400
I stay away from salt and all kinds of,

5321
02:11:56,401 --> 02:11:57,910
there's all kinds of
shit that triggers all.

5322
02:11:58,180 --> 02:11:59,160
Sounds good for you?

5323
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:00,570
Not For me.

5324
02:12:00,570 --> 02:12:01,440
It's bad for me.

5325
02:12:01,700 --> 02:12:02,010
Yeah,

5326
02:12:02,010 --> 02:12:04,500
it's probably sodium and salt.

5327
02:12:04,910 --> 02:12:05,630
Um,

5328
02:12:05,630 --> 02:12:07,310
but actual natural caffeine,

5329
02:12:07,560 --> 02:12:08,190
caffeine,

5330
02:12:08,190 --> 02:12:10,260
all that shit triggers this alcohol.

5331
02:12:10,261 --> 02:12:11,094
All the fun shit.

5332
02:12:11,190 --> 02:12:11,740
Really?

5333
02:12:11,740 --> 02:12:11,851
Yeah.

5334
02:12:11,851 --> 02:12:12,684
All the fun stuff.

5335
02:12:13,200 --> 02:12:14,610
I was cake cake fucked up.

5336
02:12:14,640 --> 02:12:15,091
I haven't,

5337
02:12:15,091 --> 02:12:15,661
I haven't eaten.

5338
02:12:15,661 --> 02:12:16,710
I've seriously for like,

5339
02:12:16,711 --> 02:12:18,750
I've lost 18 pounds in
the last four weeks.

5340
02:12:19,080 --> 02:12:21,640
What would make sense that keeping
your body healthy would stop them.

5341
02:12:21,641 --> 02:12:22,200
The nearest town.

5342
02:12:22,200 --> 02:12:25,560
Plus I'm just doing everything I can to
try to kick this thing and get healthy

5343
02:12:25,561 --> 02:12:26,250
again.

5344
02:12:26,250 --> 02:12:28,380
Did the boxing accentuate it?

5345
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:30,140
Did it make it worse when you sit here?

5346
02:12:30,150 --> 02:12:31,140
Any for the Tito fight?

5347
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:31,830
Oh No,

5348
02:12:31,830 --> 02:12:32,670
I didn't have it then.

5349
02:12:32,671 --> 02:12:33,504
I had,

5350
02:12:34,020 --> 02:12:34,441
I had it.

5351
02:12:34,441 --> 02:12:34,951
It was for me,

5352
02:12:34,951 --> 02:12:36,690
but I didn't actually have them.

5353
02:12:36,691 --> 02:12:37,710
I didn't get them in years.

5354
02:12:38,790 --> 02:12:39,870
My first attack was,

5355
02:12:39,871 --> 02:12:40,704
uh,

5356
02:12:41,310 --> 02:12:42,330
not this past Christmas,

5357
02:12:42,331 --> 02:12:43,320
but the Christmas before.

5358
02:12:43,550 --> 02:12:43,730
Well,

5359
02:12:43,730 --> 02:12:44,730
what do you think brought it on?

5360
02:12:45,600 --> 02:12:47,160
It's just time and you know,

5361
02:12:47,161 --> 02:12:49,800
all this stuff that
happened in Boston and yeah,

5362
02:12:49,801 --> 02:12:51,630
the accumulation of punches over the last,

5363
02:12:52,290 --> 02:12:52,770
you know,

5364
02:12:52,770 --> 02:12:53,551
however many years.

5365
02:12:53,551 --> 02:12:54,080
But yeah,

5366
02:12:54,080 --> 02:12:54,290
I,

5367
02:12:54,290 --> 02:12:55,123
I,

5368
02:12:55,170 --> 02:12:58,140
I have spots on my brain when I
went in for that thing and you know,

5369
02:12:58,620 --> 02:12:59,311
there's,

5370
02:12:59,311 --> 02:13:00,810
when you do this for a living,

5371
02:13:01,260 --> 02:13:02,093
you know,

5372
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:03,233
it's like,

5373
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:04,801
it's not like,

5374
02:13:04,801 --> 02:13:06,330
you don't know that there's risks.

5375
02:13:06,540 --> 02:13:08,700
I always knew there were risks the
whole time that I was doing it,

5376
02:13:08,790 --> 02:13:09,990
but it was what I love to do.

5377
02:13:10,440 --> 02:13:10,681
You know,

5378
02:13:10,681 --> 02:13:12,360
if I could go back and do it all again,

5379
02:13:12,510 --> 02:13:13,650
I wouldn't change one thing.

5380
02:13:14,010 --> 02:13:14,843
Wow.

5381
02:13:14,970 --> 02:13:16,320
I might have turned down the Tito fight,

5382
02:13:16,321 --> 02:13:17,860
but just,

5383
02:13:19,210 --> 02:13:20,043
yeah,

5384
02:13:20,140 --> 02:13:22,820
the brain damage seen and cry.

5385
02:13:22,830 --> 02:13:23,320
Again.

5386
02:13:23,320 --> 02:13:24,340
Chronic gamblers,

5387
02:13:24,700 --> 02:13:25,241
it's a,

5388
02:13:25,241 --> 02:13:28,810
there's been a lot of studies on
that lately that they don't know why,

5389
02:13:29,020 --> 02:13:29,561
but they,

5390
02:13:29,561 --> 02:13:31,030
there's a direct correlation.

5391
02:13:31,320 --> 02:13:32,310
People who have suffered

5392
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:34,620
brain damage and loving the game,

5393
02:13:34,630 --> 02:13:35,221
I can tell you that.

5394
02:13:35,221 --> 02:13:37,440
So it was a gamble or before
I ever had brain damage.

5395
02:13:38,260 --> 02:13:38,940
Oh yeah.

5396
02:13:38,940 --> 02:13:40,920
I've always loved gambling
since I was a kid.

5397
02:13:41,130 --> 02:13:42,210
I grew up in Vegas Bro.

5398
02:13:42,240 --> 02:13:42,780
I used to,

5399
02:13:42,780 --> 02:13:45,960
I used to go to the casinos and literally
you could fucking hang out cause he

5400
02:13:45,961 --> 02:13:46,350
knows when.

5401
02:13:46,350 --> 02:13:47,160
Back in the old days,

5402
02:13:47,160 --> 02:13:47,450
you know,

5403
02:13:47,450 --> 02:13:49,320
you didn't get chased out
like you do that today,

5404
02:13:49,930 --> 02:13:50,251
you know,

5405
02:13:50,251 --> 02:13:54,080
there's so many more rules and regulations
in Vegas than there used to be when I

5406
02:13:54,081 --> 02:13:54,914
was growing up there.

5407
02:13:56,040 --> 02:13:59,790
You're talking early eighties
like 1980 81 stuff like that.

5408
02:13:59,820 --> 02:14:01,200
So you will show boat,

5409
02:14:01,350 --> 02:14:02,610
the Shoba Boston.

5410
02:14:02,611 --> 02:14:04,230
By then we moved.

5411
02:14:04,231 --> 02:14:06,600
My family lived in Boston.

5412
02:14:06,870 --> 02:14:09,150
We moved to Vegas when
I was in third grade,

5413
02:14:09,600 --> 02:14:13,530
so I consider myself really from Vegas
because that's where I really grew up.

5414
02:14:13,531 --> 02:14:14,580
And you went back to Boston?

5415
02:14:14,580 --> 02:14:17,490
Went Back to Boston when I
was 17 I moved back there.

5416
02:14:17,491 --> 02:14:17,881
What happened?

5417
02:14:17,881 --> 02:14:18,800
I didn't really move back there.

5418
02:14:18,801 --> 02:14:21,380
I went back there on vacation
and I just fucking stay.

5419
02:14:21,381 --> 02:14:22,560
That was having a blast back there.

5420
02:14:22,561 --> 02:14:22,771
I said,

5421
02:14:22,771 --> 02:14:23,101
fuck it.

5422
02:14:23,101 --> 02:14:23,934
I'm going to stay.

5423
02:14:24,210 --> 02:14:25,110
So I just stayed.

5424
02:14:25,850 --> 02:14:26,250
Wow.

5425
02:14:26,250 --> 02:14:26,970
Fuck standing.

5426
02:14:26,970 --> 02:14:27,570
But I used to,

5427
02:14:27,570 --> 02:14:31,290
I used to go into the casinos
and watch guys played big money.

5428
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:33,960
Just watch guys played big money
and watches these guys going,

5429
02:14:33,961 --> 02:14:34,741
Holy Shit.

5430
02:14:34,741 --> 02:14:36,030
What's the most money you've ever gamble?

5431
02:14:36,060 --> 02:14:37,320
50 grand.

5432
02:14:37,350 --> 02:14:40,650
What's the most money you've ever gambled
the most I've ever lost in one night.

5433
02:14:42,630 --> 02:14:43,590
$8 tellers.

5434
02:14:43,620 --> 02:14:43,891
Okay.

5435
02:14:43,891 --> 02:14:45,120
What's the most you've ever lost someone?

5436
02:14:45,121 --> 02:14:45,954
1 million bucks.

5437
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:50,330
Oh.

5438
02:14:50,430 --> 02:14:51,870
Oh my God.

5439
02:14:51,960 --> 02:14:52,793
How'd you sleep?

5440
02:14:54,420 --> 02:14:54,961
Pretty good.

5441
02:14:54,961 --> 02:14:55,360
Elliot.

5442
02:14:55,360 --> 02:14:56,720
Elliot's been with me for some praise.

5443
02:14:56,721 --> 02:14:57,270
The ones.

5444
02:14:57,270 --> 02:14:57,751
How much is it?

5445
02:14:57,751 --> 02:14:58,650
What's the most you've ever won?

5446
02:14:58,680 --> 02:14:59,513
6 million.

5447
02:14:59,880 --> 02:15:02,960
Oh Jesus,

5448
02:15:04,150 --> 02:15:06,360
one 6,000,090 6 million bucks.

5449
02:15:06,420 --> 02:15:07,520
Oh my God.

5450
02:15:07,521 --> 02:15:08,101
He said treated.

5451
02:15:08,101 --> 02:15:12,570
The reason why we don't go back to the
palms is because they cut back your a

5452
02:15:12,571 --> 02:15:14,860
your gambling budget because
you were killing him.

5453
02:15:15,680 --> 02:15:16,170
Yeah.

5454
02:15:16,170 --> 02:15:17,003
Really?

5455
02:15:17,640 --> 02:15:18,570
That seems ridiculous,

5456
02:15:18,950 --> 02:15:20,370
but that's the way Vegas is now,

5457
02:15:20,520 --> 02:15:22,290
but that seems ridiculous that
they would do that with you,

5458
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:23,700
but that's the way Vegas is now.

5459
02:15:23,760 --> 02:15:24,211
These guys,

5460
02:15:24,211 --> 02:15:24,960
these guys,

5461
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:26,370
the way the economy is and stuff,

5462
02:15:26,371 --> 02:15:27,360
Vegas ain't what it used to be,

5463
02:15:27,361 --> 02:15:28,020
brother.

5464
02:15:28,020 --> 02:15:28,771
You look at the wind,

5465
02:15:28,771 --> 02:15:31,710
go try to play big money at the
wind that the other pussies.

5466
02:15:31,740 --> 02:15:32,350
It's fucking

5467
02:15:32,350 --> 02:15:32,550
great.

5468
02:15:32,550 --> 02:15:34,470
Did you see what happened in Vegas today?

5469
02:15:34,471 --> 02:15:35,304
There is.

5470
02:15:36,930 --> 02:15:40,800
There was a shootout right on the strip
and a rapper's dead and like three

5471
02:15:40,801 --> 02:15:41,610
people are dead.

5472
02:15:41,610 --> 02:15:42,470
Who's the rapper?

5473
02:15:42,690 --> 02:15:46,710
His name is Kenny Chery
junior or a rapper.

5474
02:15:46,711 --> 02:15:48,180
Also known as kidney clutch.

5475
02:15:48,850 --> 02:15:49,600
Have you heard of him?

5476
02:15:49,600 --> 02:15:50,380
No.

5477
02:15:50,380 --> 02:15:50,980
Me Neither.

5478
02:15:50,980 --> 02:15:51,850
But yeah,

5479
02:15:51,851 --> 02:15:53,130
there's all the where where,

5480
02:15:53,140 --> 02:15:53,560
where,

5481
02:15:53,560 --> 02:15:54,230
where did it happen?

5482
02:15:54,230 --> 02:15:56,170
I believe it was right
in front of the Bellagio.

5483
02:15:56,270 --> 02:15:57,103
Whoa.

5484
02:15:57,950 --> 02:15:58,161
Oh,

5485
02:15:58,161 --> 02:16:00,650
big shootout happened and people
just started getting shot.

5486
02:16:00,720 --> 02:16:00,961
Yeah.

5487
02:16:00,961 --> 02:16:05,880
How many people got shot and start around
4:20 AM a dispute in the valet lot of

5488
02:16:05,881 --> 02:16:06,541
the area,

5489
02:16:06,541 --> 02:16:07,374
hotel,

5490
02:16:07,530 --> 02:16:12,060
Aria Hotel and about a block
away and then the driver was hit.

5491
02:16:12,061 --> 02:16:16,050
The Maserati continued into
the intersection of the
boulevard and Flamingo Road

5492
02:16:16,051 --> 02:16:20,130
and collided with a taxi which
caught fire and like a movie,

5493
02:16:20,250 --> 02:16:22,080
three other people died in it.

5494
02:16:22,550 --> 02:16:22,960
Okay.

5495
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:23,650
Whoa.

5496
02:16:23,650 --> 02:16:25,030
Holy Shit.

5497
02:16:25,300 --> 02:16:26,200
That is freaky.

5498
02:16:26,290 --> 02:16:28,000
Do you remember when the all star,

5499
02:16:28,001 --> 02:16:30,640
the NBA star game came to Vegas?

5500
02:16:30,641 --> 02:16:31,660
This fucking crazy.

5501
02:16:31,661 --> 02:16:33,690
Murders and shootouts there?

5502
02:16:33,700 --> 02:16:34,241
I'm telling you,

5503
02:16:34,241 --> 02:16:37,720
I was actually funny cause it was the
Bellagio when that thing was there.

5504
02:16:37,721 --> 02:16:39,820
I was at the Bellagio and it was just,

5505
02:16:40,300 --> 02:16:41,320
it was bad man.

5506
02:16:41,321 --> 02:16:41,681
It was like,

5507
02:16:41,681 --> 02:16:43,630
it's just just a bad five in there.

5508
02:16:43,631 --> 02:16:44,860
And it was weird.

5509
02:16:45,440 --> 02:16:46,740
It was the week.

5510
02:16:46,780 --> 02:16:47,381
I don't know.

5511
02:16:47,381 --> 02:16:48,190
It's just,

5512
02:16:48,190 --> 02:16:48,821
I'll tell you what,

5513
02:16:48,821 --> 02:16:49,421
it felt like.

5514
02:16:49,421 --> 02:16:53,770
It felt like the night that I was at
the Tyson and Holyfield fight when he

5515
02:16:53,771 --> 02:16:55,210
fucking bit his ear and all that shit.

5516
02:16:55,211 --> 02:16:56,350
The Night Tupac got shot.

5517
02:16:56,740 --> 02:16:56,951
Dude,

5518
02:16:56,951 --> 02:16:59,500
I was fucking there that
night and it was bad.

5519
02:16:59,710 --> 02:16:59,921
I mean,

5520
02:16:59,921 --> 02:17:02,110
they didn't report how bad it really was.

5521
02:17:03,610 --> 02:17:05,770
People were fucking grabbing
chips off the table.

5522
02:17:05,771 --> 02:17:07,120
People were jumping on top of the,

5523
02:17:07,390 --> 02:17:08,410
on top of the tables.

5524
02:17:08,620 --> 02:17:10,000
I remember when we
walked out of the fight,

5525
02:17:10,001 --> 02:17:12,210
somebody took and through the programs,

5526
02:17:12,211 --> 02:17:15,790
slap them out of the guy's hands and
people were just going fucking crazy.

5527
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:16,990
It's weird.

5528
02:17:17,550 --> 02:17:20,740
And people who are listening might
have been in this situation before,

5529
02:17:20,741 --> 02:17:23,440
especially Canadians and
shit cause it fucking hockey.

5530
02:17:23,441 --> 02:17:27,160
But when the riot starts to break out,

5531
02:17:27,220 --> 02:17:28,420
it is a creepy,

5532
02:17:28,421 --> 02:17:29,770
weird feeling man.

5533
02:17:30,130 --> 02:17:31,540
But I can't explain it.

5534
02:17:31,810 --> 02:17:34,480
And people who have been in it will
understand what I'm talking about.

5535
02:17:34,870 --> 02:17:36,730
You feel it starting to happen.

5536
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:38,051
And I was like,

5537
02:17:38,051 --> 02:17:39,790
we gotta get the Fuck Outta here man.

5538
02:17:40,090 --> 02:17:40,660
Um,

5539
02:17:40,660 --> 02:17:41,590
and we,

5540
02:17:41,591 --> 02:17:42,424
uh,

5541
02:17:43,750 --> 02:17:45,640
we got out and we started
to felt like a bad,

5542
02:17:45,660 --> 02:17:49,300
it was felt like a wave was
coming behind us and just shit,

5543
02:17:49,301 --> 02:17:50,590
what's going on everywhere.

5544
02:17:50,950 --> 02:17:54,100
And then we got out just in time
before they locked that place down.

5545
02:17:55,180 --> 02:17:55,630
Yeah.

5546
02:17:55,630 --> 02:17:56,920
They don't fuck around in Vegas,

5547
02:17:56,921 --> 02:17:57,340
man.

5548
02:17:57,340 --> 02:18:01,360
I remember when we were in Vancouver and
then there was the riots right after we

5549
02:18:01,361 --> 02:18:02,350
left the hockey.

5550
02:18:02,510 --> 02:18:03,250
Right.

5551
02:18:03,250 --> 02:18:04,540
That was right after we left.

5552
02:18:04,541 --> 02:18:04,861
Yeah,

5553
02:18:04,861 --> 02:18:06,310
it was fucking crazy.

5554
02:18:06,311 --> 02:18:06,760
Right.

5555
02:18:06,760 --> 02:18:10,540
Cause that was the first time there was
like real accountability for that shit

5556
02:18:10,541 --> 02:18:12,120
where they got photos
of everybody doing it.

5557
02:18:12,130 --> 02:18:12,311
Like,

5558
02:18:12,311 --> 02:18:13,150
Hey asshole,

5559
02:18:13,300 --> 02:18:14,440
we know who you are.

5560
02:18:14,590 --> 02:18:14,891
And I,

5561
02:18:14,891 --> 02:18:17,380
and after all these guys and
they were like regular college.

5562
02:18:17,560 --> 02:18:17,920
Yeah.

5563
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:19,570
These days with all the cameras.

5564
02:18:20,160 --> 02:18:20,590
Yeah.

5565
02:18:20,590 --> 02:18:21,880
The other thing last,

5566
02:18:21,881 --> 02:18:22,420
uh,

5567
02:18:22,420 --> 02:18:22,661
you know,

5568
02:18:22,661 --> 02:18:24,850
I like going to to Celtic Laker games,

5569
02:18:24,851 --> 02:18:25,900
man and la La.

5570
02:18:25,930 --> 02:18:26,591
It's awesome.

5571
02:18:26,591 --> 02:18:27,191
That's the best.

5572
02:18:27,191 --> 02:18:28,024
I love doing it.

5573
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:30,760
So for game seven,

5574
02:18:31,230 --> 02:18:31,650
um,

5575
02:18:31,650 --> 02:18:34,030
last time that the Lakers played
the Celtics in the championship,

5576
02:18:34,090 --> 02:18:37,330
I was there for game seven
Celtics of winning the whole game.

5577
02:18:37,480 --> 02:18:38,680
They ended up losing at the end,

5578
02:18:38,681 --> 02:18:39,280
right.

5579
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:44,280
So we leave and we're leaving and we're
starting to drive way they fucking one.

5580
02:18:44,340 --> 02:18:45,040
All right.

5581
02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:46,570
People are jumping on cars.

5582
02:18:46,571 --> 02:18:47,404
People started,

5583
02:18:47,440 --> 02:18:47,770
you know,

5584
02:18:47,770 --> 02:18:47,921
you're,

5585
02:18:47,921 --> 02:18:50,500
you're in traffic getting out of there
and people are just jumping on your

5586
02:18:50,501 --> 02:18:52,630
fucking car and jumping from car to car.

5587
02:18:52,631 --> 02:18:53,350
I was like,

5588
02:18:53,350 --> 02:18:53,891
Holy Shit,

5589
02:18:53,891 --> 02:18:54,611
this is crazy.

5590
02:18:54,611 --> 02:18:57,370
So we go over this restaurant
that's down the street,

5591
02:18:57,371 --> 02:18:57,851
the palm,

5592
02:18:57,851 --> 02:18:59,950
and we're going to go over there and eat
and I get out of the car and all these

5593
02:18:59,951 --> 02:19:00,491
people out there,

5594
02:19:00,491 --> 02:19:01,311
all these Laker fans.

5595
02:19:01,311 --> 02:19:01,970
I'm like,

5596
02:19:01,970 --> 02:19:02,291
Dana,

5597
02:19:02,291 --> 02:19:02,740
why?

5598
02:19:02,740 --> 02:19:03,610
What's up Dana White?

5599
02:19:03,760 --> 02:19:05,080
You're a fucking Celtics Fan,

5600
02:19:05,081 --> 02:19:05,620
aren't you?

5601
02:19:05,620 --> 02:19:05,921
I said,

5602
02:19:05,921 --> 02:19:06,430
Huh,

5603
02:19:06,430 --> 02:19:07,480
I don't even fuck a watch.

5604
02:19:07,481 --> 02:19:08,314
Basketball

5605
02:19:10,510 --> 02:19:11,680
wasn't even there for the game.

5606
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:14,440
Fucking get to know Wyatt
with the fucking Laker fans.

5607
02:19:14,441 --> 02:19:15,274
Are you kidding me?

5608
02:19:15,710 --> 02:19:17,530
They get me the fuck outta here.

5609
02:19:17,560 --> 02:19:17,921
Didn't they?

5610
02:19:17,921 --> 02:19:22,921
The Dodgers beat the shit out of some
fucking kid giants fan and killed him or

5611
02:19:23,370 --> 02:19:24,320
no crippled him.

5612
02:19:24,670 --> 02:19:25,241
He's really,

5613
02:19:25,241 --> 02:19:25,601
really,

5614
02:19:25,601 --> 02:19:26,590
really fucked up.

5615
02:19:27,020 --> 02:19:27,171
Yeah,

5616
02:19:27,171 --> 02:19:29,120
that's a thing that fucking,

5617
02:19:29,150 --> 02:19:31,850
that thing that happens after games in La,

5618
02:19:31,851 --> 02:19:32,780
it happens a lot.

5619
02:19:32,781 --> 02:19:35,420
They liked cars on fire
and flip him over and shit.

5620
02:19:35,570 --> 02:19:36,500
Even if they win,

5621
02:19:37,280 --> 02:19:41,300
it's like they are looking
for an opportunity to do
something really crazy and

5622
02:19:41,301 --> 02:19:41,910
fucked up.

5623
02:19:41,910 --> 02:19:46,910
I almost died at the last UFC because
you tweeted a tickets at Mandalay bay and

5624
02:19:47,461 --> 02:19:50,610
there was just this roar coming down the
hallway and I turned around and there

5625
02:19:50,611 --> 02:19:53,880
was probably a good 200 people running
down the hallway of Mandalay bay.

5626
02:19:54,120 --> 02:19:54,953
Yeah,

5627
02:19:55,110 --> 02:19:57,840
we've had some bad situations
with tweeting tickets.

5628
02:19:57,841 --> 02:19:59,820
I usually try to control it as best I can.

5629
02:19:59,940 --> 02:20:01,530
How the worst ever was in Toronto.

5630
02:20:02,310 --> 02:20:03,690
Toronto was really scary.

5631
02:20:03,750 --> 02:20:06,960
We had a bad situation up there where
people just went fucking crazy and we're

5632
02:20:06,961 --> 02:20:09,600
trying to rush in and I'm
looking down and I see these,

5633
02:20:09,620 --> 02:20:11,900
you know those girls in there
too and they're getting smashed.

5634
02:20:13,350 --> 02:20:14,070
It's freaky.

5635
02:20:14,070 --> 02:20:14,903
It's freaky

5636
02:20:16,930 --> 02:20:17,920
big people too.

5637
02:20:17,921 --> 02:20:18,754
Usually

5638
02:20:19,100 --> 02:20:20,560
not a big people coming my way.

5639
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:21,581
Yeah.

5640
02:20:21,581 --> 02:20:22,960
The last time you went to fight,

5641
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:26,560
the last time place you want to
start a fight is in the crowd to UFC.

5642
02:20:26,570 --> 02:20:27,480
So true man.

5643
02:20:27,570 --> 02:20:28,730
Who the fuck is in there?

5644
02:20:28,731 --> 02:20:30,160
And 90% of them train.

5645
02:20:30,161 --> 02:20:30,994
So true.

5646
02:20:32,050 --> 02:20:33,100
It's funny because you know,

5647
02:20:33,101 --> 02:20:36,100
you say that I was driving
the other day and uh,

5648
02:20:37,240 --> 02:20:37,551
and I,

5649
02:20:37,551 --> 02:20:39,010
and I had one of my buddies in the car,

5650
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:39,873
right.

5651
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:40,571
And I said,

5652
02:20:40,571 --> 02:20:43,360
you see that dude at the light
and this fucking dude with Lanky,

5653
02:20:43,361 --> 02:20:45,730
skinny as hell glasses on,

5654
02:20:45,880 --> 02:20:50,880
fucking pasty white fucked up here guy
look like the biggest fucking Dork you've

5655
02:20:50,981 --> 02:20:51,910
ever seen in your life.

5656
02:20:51,911 --> 02:20:52,420
Right?

5657
02:20:52,420 --> 02:20:53,350
This dude that you would,

5658
02:20:53,380 --> 02:20:53,950
you know.

5659
02:20:53,950 --> 02:20:54,761
And I said to my buddy,

5660
02:20:54,761 --> 02:20:57,130
that dude would whoop your fucking ass.

5661
02:20:57,131 --> 02:20:57,964
You realize that right?

5662
02:20:58,670 --> 02:20:58,900
Fuck,

5663
02:20:58,900 --> 02:20:59,511
what are you talking about?

5664
02:20:59,511 --> 02:21:02,620
That fucking drove whether he had a big
tradition sticker on the back of his

5665
02:21:02,621 --> 02:21:02,891
car,

5666
02:21:02,891 --> 02:21:04,480
like he goes to one of
the Jujitsu schools,

5667
02:21:04,481 --> 02:21:04,870
you know,

5668
02:21:04,870 --> 02:21:08,320
that's one of those dudes that like a
Joe Lowe's honor or one of those type of

5669
02:21:08,321 --> 02:21:09,160
guys you'd be like,

5670
02:21:09,460 --> 02:21:13,040
or who was the other kid that used
to fight for us and his whole yes,

5671
02:21:13,450 --> 02:21:14,281
him and no,

5672
02:21:14,281 --> 02:21:14,910
the other one,

5673
02:21:14,910 --> 02:21:15,790
there were two brothers.

5674
02:21:15,790 --> 02:21:17,500
His whole thing was kind
of like being a nerd.

5675
02:21:17,670 --> 02:21:18,580
Then you look like a nerd.

5676
02:21:18,581 --> 02:21:19,720
But he was a bad ass duty.

5677
02:21:19,960 --> 02:21:21,520
I think he came from Franklin's place.

5678
02:21:21,820 --> 02:21:22,653
The barn cat.

5679
02:21:23,050 --> 02:21:23,771
Yeah.

5680
02:21:23,771 --> 02:21:25,120
Fuck God dammit.

5681
02:21:25,330 --> 02:21:25,631
Hold on.

5682
02:21:25,631 --> 02:21:27,370
So those kids that look like,

5683
02:21:27,371 --> 02:21:27,940
you know,

5684
02:21:27,940 --> 02:21:28,900
if they said anything to you,

5685
02:21:28,901 --> 02:21:29,734
you'd be like,

5686
02:21:29,770 --> 02:21:30,011
dude,

5687
02:21:30,011 --> 02:21:30,850
I'll whoop your ass.

5688
02:21:30,851 --> 02:21:32,940
Those are the guys that will
put you in a fucking calm room.

5689
02:21:33,150 --> 02:21:33,410
It was,

5690
02:21:33,410 --> 02:21:34,930
look at the ears tend to McCrory.

5691
02:21:35,290 --> 02:21:36,123
Camden McCrory.

5692
02:21:36,370 --> 02:21:37,900
Mccrory was a bad mother fuckers.

5693
02:21:37,901 --> 02:21:38,381
Tough kid.

5694
02:21:38,381 --> 02:21:39,490
What is he doing these days?

5695
02:21:39,580 --> 02:21:40,200
Yeah,

5696
02:21:40,200 --> 02:21:40,810
I know where he's at.

5697
02:21:40,810 --> 02:21:41,650
He was tough.

5698
02:21:41,740 --> 02:21:43,090
So many guys in and out.

5699
02:21:43,091 --> 02:21:44,560
I mean we've seen so many finders.

5700
02:21:44,860 --> 02:21:46,510
How many fires did you guys just cut?

5701
02:21:47,590 --> 02:21:48,220
Um,

5702
02:21:48,220 --> 02:21:50,980
I think it was like 15 I think 50 shit.

5703
02:21:51,220 --> 02:21:52,780
A lot of people got bummed
out at some of them.

5704
02:21:52,781 --> 02:21:53,020
Right?

5705
02:21:53,020 --> 02:21:53,710
Like Fitch.

5706
02:21:53,710 --> 02:21:54,570
People got bummed out at.

5707
02:21:54,670 --> 02:21:55,110
Yeah.

5708
02:21:55,110 --> 02:21:55,490
If,

5709
02:21:55,490 --> 02:21:55,871
if there's,

5710
02:21:55,871 --> 02:21:58,300
if there's one you really want
to make a case for its Fitch,

5711
02:21:58,330 --> 02:21:59,163
you know what I mean?

5712
02:21:59,350 --> 02:22:00,940
But this is nothing new.

5713
02:22:00,941 --> 02:22:01,810
This didn't just start,

5714
02:22:01,811 --> 02:22:02,860
I mean we can just start say,

5715
02:22:02,861 --> 02:22:03,011
oh,

5716
02:22:03,011 --> 02:22:03,251
you know,

5717
02:22:03,251 --> 02:22:04,210
we're going to start cutting guys.

5718
02:22:04,540 --> 02:22:05,111
Guys get cut.

5719
02:22:05,111 --> 02:22:05,944
Every event,

5720
02:22:06,070 --> 02:22:07,150
every event we have,

5721
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:08,260
there's a,

5722
02:22:09,010 --> 02:22:09,940
there's two things.

5723
02:22:10,360 --> 02:22:11,081
After every event,

5724
02:22:11,081 --> 02:22:13,930
there's a list of guys that their
contracts were almost up and need to be

5725
02:22:13,931 --> 02:22:16,390
reassigned and there's a list
of guys that are getting cut.

5726
02:22:16,720 --> 02:22:20,500
Is there a way to make more fights?

5727
02:22:20,560 --> 02:22:23,110
Is it that's a saturation point right now.

5728
02:22:23,150 --> 02:22:26,340
Know that that's what's funny
because everybody's like,

5729
02:22:26,341 --> 02:22:27,480
there's too many fights.

5730
02:22:27,510 --> 02:22:28,260
Too many fights.

5731
02:22:28,260 --> 02:22:29,370
If I can get to me it went too.

5732
02:22:29,371 --> 02:22:30,930
Fuck you talking about
there's too many fights.

5733
02:22:30,931 --> 02:22:32,400
Are there too many
football games out to me?

5734
02:22:32,580 --> 02:22:34,650
As long as we're putting on good fights,

5735
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:36,060
people want to watch them.

5736
02:22:37,050 --> 02:22:38,670
That was one of the big problems with,

5737
02:22:38,671 --> 02:22:39,300
with our,

5738
02:22:39,300 --> 02:22:39,631
uh,

5739
02:22:39,631 --> 02:22:40,830
our other television deal.

5740
02:22:40,950 --> 02:22:42,210
They couldn't handle our content.

5741
02:22:42,720 --> 02:22:44,130
As we continue to grow,

5742
02:22:44,430 --> 02:22:46,200
we've got more and more
content that we need.

5743
02:22:46,201 --> 02:22:47,970
Meaning we need to put more fights on TV.

5744
02:22:48,300 --> 02:22:53,130
They couldn't handle the load spike
TV as opposed to fuel and Fox and Fox.

5745
02:22:53,160 --> 02:22:53,461
Right.

5746
02:22:53,461 --> 02:22:58,461
Fox can handle the amount of fights that
we want to do and I go to and they have

5747
02:22:59,170 --> 02:23:02,820
effects on or fuel on me all the
time and it's just fucking fights.

5748
02:23:03,030 --> 02:23:06,210
Fuel F it's like the UFC network dude.

5749
02:23:06,390 --> 02:23:09,000
Fuel has become awesome fucking channel.

5750
02:23:09,150 --> 02:23:09,811
If you sit down,

5751
02:23:09,811 --> 02:23:11,880
if you ever used to watch
fuel back in the old days,

5752
02:23:11,881 --> 02:23:13,650
you know it seemed like this,

5753
02:23:13,770 --> 02:23:16,890
you know your watch fuel
now it's fucking bad ass.

5754
02:23:16,891 --> 02:23:18,270
It's such a really good network.

5755
02:23:18,330 --> 02:23:19,680
If you love the UFC,

5756
02:23:20,180 --> 02:23:21,660
you got to watch fucking fuel.

5757
02:23:21,661 --> 02:23:25,500
I was there at this pool hall the other
day and they had the best of 2012 on and

5758
02:23:25,501 --> 02:23:27,450
it was like short attention span.

5759
02:23:27,451 --> 02:23:28,740
Theater was just bang,

5760
02:23:28,741 --> 02:23:29,041
Bang,

5761
02:23:29,041 --> 02:23:29,371
Bang,

5762
02:23:29,371 --> 02:23:30,840
like highlight reels.

5763
02:23:31,020 --> 02:23:32,220
Not even the fights,

5764
02:23:32,221 --> 02:23:33,810
but the highlights of these fights.

5765
02:23:33,930 --> 02:23:35,630
So it was just insanity afterwards.

5766
02:23:35,640 --> 02:23:39,240
It was so hard to pay attention to pool
because it was just like head kick,

5767
02:23:39,270 --> 02:23:40,230
strangled,

5768
02:23:40,380 --> 02:23:41,450
fucking take down,

5769
02:23:41,451 --> 02:23:41,851
boom,

5770
02:23:41,851 --> 02:23:42,181
boom,

5771
02:23:42,181 --> 02:23:42,810
boom.

5772
02:23:42,810 --> 02:23:43,750
Just chaos.

5773
02:23:43,751 --> 02:23:44,041
It is.

5774
02:23:44,041 --> 02:23:44,581
It's awesome.

5775
02:23:44,581 --> 02:23:48,270
The other thing that they had on me and
the rents were in this meeting and the

5776
02:23:48,290 --> 02:23:48,990
rentals office,

5777
02:23:48,990 --> 02:23:51,210
and he's got this huge
fucking TV over on the side,

5778
02:23:51,211 --> 02:23:51,750
right?

5779
02:23:51,750 --> 02:23:55,200
And fuel was on and it
was like the prides,

5780
02:23:55,480 --> 02:23:56,221
like prides,

5781
02:23:56,221 --> 02:23:57,510
greatest knockouts ever.

5782
02:23:57,810 --> 02:24:00,450
And there were sitting there and we're
trying to talk and I keep looking over at

5783
02:24:00,451 --> 02:24:02,910
the fucking TV and I'm like,

5784
02:24:02,940 --> 02:24:03,570
Oh shit,

5785
02:24:03,570 --> 02:24:04,440
I forgot about that one.

5786
02:24:04,440 --> 02:24:06,810
And then we started watching the fucking
knock outs for a minute and then we'll

5787
02:24:06,811 --> 02:24:07,530
get back to the meeting.

5788
02:24:07,530 --> 02:24:07,890
I'm like,

5789
02:24:07,890 --> 02:24:08,101
dude,

5790
02:24:08,101 --> 02:24:09,360
turn this fucking TV off.

5791
02:24:09,361 --> 02:24:09,721
We can't,

5792
02:24:09,721 --> 02:24:11,100
we can't even fucking talk in here.

5793
02:24:11,550 --> 02:24:11,971
And uh,

5794
02:24:11,971 --> 02:24:13,310
and his fight scene.

5795
02:24:14,010 --> 02:24:15,780
But the thing is when
you see that old pride,

5796
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:16,141
cause,

5797
02:24:16,141 --> 02:24:17,940
cause we used to watch pride ever when,

5798
02:24:17,960 --> 02:24:18,240
when,

5799
02:24:18,240 --> 02:24:19,073
uh,

5800
02:24:19,080 --> 02:24:20,070
back when the office was,

5801
02:24:20,080 --> 02:24:21,330
we own the whole building now,

5802
02:24:21,390 --> 02:24:23,160
but it used to be for Tita enterprises,

5803
02:24:23,430 --> 02:24:27,270
Gordon Biersch and then I had a fucking
broom closet over on the side over for

5804
02:24:27,271 --> 02:24:28,104
the UFC.

5805
02:24:28,320 --> 02:24:30,510
And we used to have,

5806
02:24:30,511 --> 02:24:32,670
this is his dad had this big library.

5807
02:24:32,940 --> 02:24:34,200
It was fucking awesome.

5808
02:24:34,201 --> 02:24:35,070
It was all pimped out.

5809
02:24:35,170 --> 02:24:37,020
They'd Gordon Biersch on tap and shit.

5810
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:38,490
And it was really cool.

5811
02:24:38,610 --> 02:24:41,430
And we used to go there and we
used to watch all the pride fights.

5812
02:24:41,820 --> 02:24:42,570
And uh,

5813
02:24:42,570 --> 02:24:44,310
so when you see those old pride fights,

5814
02:24:44,311 --> 02:24:45,110
you know,

5815
02:24:45,110 --> 02:24:46,260
so it's just,

5816
02:24:46,261 --> 02:24:46,651
it's fun,

5817
02:24:46,651 --> 02:24:46,890
man.

5818
02:24:46,890 --> 02:24:49,010
I was the biggest fucking soccer.

5819
02:24:49,011 --> 02:24:49,890
Rob a fan man.

5820
02:24:49,891 --> 02:24:51,290
I was such a huge fan of soccer.

5821
02:24:51,291 --> 02:24:52,124
Sakuraba.

5822
02:24:52,140 --> 02:24:52,451
Yeah,

5823
02:24:52,451 --> 02:24:53,251
I was a huge,

5824
02:24:53,251 --> 02:24:54,150
huge pride fan.

5825
02:24:54,180 --> 02:24:54,391
You know,

5826
02:24:54,391 --> 02:24:58,200
they offered me the job as a commentator
and pride before I worked for you guys

5827
02:24:58,410 --> 02:25:01,230
and they offered me when
I was at your after party,

5828
02:25:02,560 --> 02:25:03,960
the pride Piaf came up to me.

5829
02:25:04,400 --> 02:25:09,400
I like to talk to you a medic [inaudible]
dude come and teddy footprint,

5830
02:25:10,550 --> 02:25:12,960
but I do come over here and I was like,

5831
02:25:12,961 --> 02:25:14,280
get the fuck outta here.

5832
02:25:14,840 --> 02:25:16,450
I'm not going to judge that.

5833
02:25:16,520 --> 02:25:19,140
We're definitely not doing that dude.

5834
02:25:19,141 --> 02:25:19,771
It was crazy.

5835
02:25:19,771 --> 02:25:20,150
It's,

5836
02:25:20,150 --> 02:25:20,490
it's,

5837
02:25:20,490 --> 02:25:23,890
I'm really surprised with
all the stories that I hear

5838
02:25:24,190 --> 02:25:27,730
and the stuff that I just know myself
about pride that more the more the

5839
02:25:27,731 --> 02:25:31,510
fighters will talk to me about what went
down in pride in the stuff to fucking

5840
02:25:31,511 --> 02:25:31,680
happen.

5841
02:25:31,680 --> 02:25:33,290
But I don't ever hear him
talk about it publicly.

5842
02:25:33,350 --> 02:25:33,531
Well,

5843
02:25:33,531 --> 02:25:37,010
we had an incident on the podcast and
he was telling us the whole Yakuza

5844
02:25:37,011 --> 02:25:37,844
connection.

5845
02:25:37,940 --> 02:25:38,870
It was fascinating.

5846
02:25:39,020 --> 02:25:39,591
Listen to him,

5847
02:25:39,591 --> 02:25:40,220
tell him about,

5848
02:25:40,220 --> 02:25:40,401
you know,

5849
02:25:40,401 --> 02:25:41,960
when it was like working back then,

5850
02:25:42,380 --> 02:25:42,621
you know,

5851
02:25:42,621 --> 02:25:44,270
working for these guys
and what do with it.

5852
02:25:44,300 --> 02:25:44,600
You know,

5853
02:25:44,600 --> 02:25:48,020
he became like friends with all these
Yakuza guys and got in with all the

5854
02:25:48,021 --> 02:25:49,490
accuser is like,

5855
02:25:49,550 --> 02:25:51,160
that's how they run things over there.

5856
02:25:51,250 --> 02:25:51,621
It's just,

5857
02:25:51,621 --> 02:25:52,280
that's the,

5858
02:25:52,280 --> 02:25:53,780
that's the price of doing business.

5859
02:25:53,781 --> 02:25:57,200
And pride was just completely
interconnected with it.

5860
02:25:57,950 --> 02:25:58,610
It's uh,

5861
02:25:58,610 --> 02:25:59,090
it's,

5862
02:25:59,090 --> 02:26:00,800
I mean it's a part of history,

5863
02:26:01,100 --> 02:26:01,933
you know,

5864
02:26:02,030 --> 02:26:02,960
but you know,

5865
02:26:02,961 --> 02:26:05,000
no more a part of history than the UFC,

5866
02:26:05,001 --> 02:26:05,834
but you really,

5867
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:08,870
do you ever stop and think about how
crazy it is that you're a part of this

5868
02:26:09,350 --> 02:26:10,183
thing that,

5869
02:26:10,430 --> 02:26:11,480
like I said before,

5870
02:26:11,481 --> 02:26:13,440
just sort of exploded onto the,

5871
02:26:13,441 --> 02:26:13,830
the,

5872
02:26:13,830 --> 02:26:16,460
the popular culture that
didn't exist before.

5873
02:26:16,700 --> 02:26:17,660
When we were kids,

5874
02:26:18,260 --> 02:26:19,370
there was different martial arts.

5875
02:26:19,371 --> 02:26:23,120
It was judo and karate and all this shit
and no one knew what the fuck was the

5876
02:26:23,121 --> 02:26:23,751
best thing.

5877
02:26:23,751 --> 02:26:25,220
And everybody had their own beliefs.

5878
02:26:25,880 --> 02:26:30,880
But to have from 1993 to 2013 so this,

5879
02:26:31,430 --> 02:26:31,820
this,

5880
02:26:31,820 --> 02:26:34,310
this 20 year gap that we've seen,

5881
02:26:34,700 --> 02:26:39,700
we've seen the evolution of martial arts
just completely changed and this sport

5882
02:26:40,431 --> 02:26:45,080
just explode into the mainstream
and you're at the front of it.

5883
02:26:45,820 --> 02:26:46,970
Like that's a wild ride,

5884
02:26:46,971 --> 02:26:47,271
dude.

5885
02:26:47,271 --> 02:26:48,950
That's a wild ride for a regular guy.

5886
02:26:49,130 --> 02:26:49,881
When I met you,

5887
02:26:49,881 --> 02:26:50,661
I was on TV,

5888
02:26:50,661 --> 02:26:52,820
you are fucking regular guy.

5889
02:26:52,821 --> 02:26:56,870
He was a boxing manager and all of a
sudden you're like a celebrity now and

5890
02:26:56,871 --> 02:26:57,980
you're like a part of the host,

5891
02:26:57,981 --> 02:26:58,814
the ultimate fighter.

5892
02:26:58,940 --> 02:26:59,780
But somehow or another,

5893
02:26:59,781 --> 02:27:00,860
you've seamlessly,

5894
02:27:01,340 --> 02:27:05,390
sorta smoothly operated
through this strange thing.

5895
02:27:05,540 --> 02:27:06,890
But you're still the same guy.

5896
02:27:06,920 --> 02:27:08,090
I appreciate every other word.

5897
02:27:08,090 --> 02:27:09,020
It's fucking,

5898
02:27:09,210 --> 02:27:10,610
it's fucking guy with his fucking,

5899
02:27:10,611 --> 02:27:12,560
we fucking tell you about
fucking victor content.

5900
02:27:12,740 --> 02:27:13,850
You're the same guy.

5901
02:27:13,851 --> 02:27:14,061
I mean,

5902
02:27:14,061 --> 02:27:17,780
that's the same guy that I could have
talked to in 2001 we could have the same

5903
02:27:17,781 --> 02:27:18,680
conversation.

5904
02:27:18,870 --> 02:27:19,430
I mean,

5905
02:27:19,430 --> 02:27:20,010
obviously you're,

5906
02:27:20,010 --> 02:27:20,751
you've grown,

5907
02:27:20,751 --> 02:27:21,351
you've learned,

5908
02:27:21,351 --> 02:27:21,501
you've,

5909
02:27:21,501 --> 02:27:23,170
you've evolved and you know me,

5910
02:27:23,190 --> 02:27:25,400
I'm not saying you're like
you're stunted your growth.

5911
02:27:25,830 --> 02:27:27,050
What I'm saying you
that you have the same.

5912
02:27:27,660 --> 02:27:28,191
I don't,

5913
02:27:28,191 --> 02:27:28,641
it's not like,

5914
02:27:28,641 --> 02:27:30,080
I don't even know Dane anymore.

5915
02:27:30,170 --> 02:27:31,070
You and I have like,

5916
02:27:31,071 --> 02:27:32,990
we've never even had an argument ever,

5917
02:27:33,560 --> 02:27:34,580
and not even close.

5918
02:27:34,640 --> 02:27:34,941
I mean,

5919
02:27:34,941 --> 02:27:35,300
that's,

5920
02:27:35,300 --> 02:27:36,460
that's Kinda crazy too.

5921
02:27:36,520 --> 02:27:36,860
Yeah.

5922
02:27:36,860 --> 02:27:37,850
You're the same dude.

5923
02:27:37,880 --> 02:27:38,031
Yeah.

5924
02:27:38,031 --> 02:27:38,800
But you know,

5925
02:27:38,800 --> 02:27:39,090
the,

5926
02:27:39,090 --> 02:27:39,250
the,

5927
02:27:39,250 --> 02:27:39,490
the,

5928
02:27:39,490 --> 02:27:42,270
the reason that you and I have never had
an argument is because you're a fucking

5929
02:27:42,271 --> 02:27:43,104
good guy.

5930
02:27:43,260 --> 02:27:43,490
You're,

5931
02:27:43,490 --> 02:27:44,340
you're a solid guy.

5932
02:27:44,341 --> 02:27:45,630
You're a fucking standup guy.

5933
02:27:45,910 --> 02:27:47,040
Your word,

5934
02:27:47,590 --> 02:27:48,423
uh,

5935
02:27:48,920 --> 02:27:49,340
you know,

5936
02:27:49,340 --> 02:27:50,430
your word is your fucking word.

5937
02:27:50,431 --> 02:27:51,480
When you say you're going to do something,

5938
02:27:51,481 --> 02:27:52,260
you do it.

5939
02:27:52,260 --> 02:27:53,070
Um,

5940
02:27:53,070 --> 02:27:53,550
you know,

5941
02:27:53,550 --> 02:27:53,910
uh,

5942
02:27:53,910 --> 02:27:56,220
every however long it is,

5943
02:27:56,221 --> 02:27:58,590
we renegotiate your
fucking contract and we,

5944
02:27:58,860 --> 02:27:59,790
we re up you,

5945
02:27:59,880 --> 02:28:01,830
there's shit that I'll
fucking call you up and say,

5946
02:28:01,831 --> 02:28:02,071
dude,

5947
02:28:02,071 --> 02:28:03,180
I need a fucking favor.

5948
02:28:03,420 --> 02:28:04,231
And you do a favor.

5949
02:28:04,231 --> 02:28:05,041
And there's times when you say,

5950
02:28:05,041 --> 02:28:05,251
dude,

5951
02:28:05,251 --> 02:28:06,690
I need a favor and I'll
give you the favor.

5952
02:28:06,691 --> 02:28:07,250
But you,

5953
02:28:07,250 --> 02:28:09,410
you operate like a
fucking real guy and you,

5954
02:28:09,411 --> 02:28:10,620
and you're a real guy too.

5955
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:11,510
Um,

5956
02:28:11,510 --> 02:28:11,660
and,

5957
02:28:11,660 --> 02:28:14,610
and that's really all
it takes to be whatever.

5958
02:28:14,611 --> 02:28:16,680
But the fact that you say
that I'm the same guy,

5959
02:28:16,681 --> 02:28:17,340
it means a lot to me.

5960
02:28:17,340 --> 02:28:18,390
And I appreciate that when,

5961
02:28:18,391 --> 02:28:18,571
when,

5962
02:28:18,571 --> 02:28:18,930
when,

5963
02:28:18,930 --> 02:28:19,920
when people say that,

5964
02:28:20,460 --> 02:28:21,310
but um,

5965
02:28:21,770 --> 02:28:22,280
you know,

5966
02:28:22,280 --> 02:28:24,080
there's a lot of there,

5967
02:28:24,081 --> 02:28:27,410
there's a lot of myths out there about
me and there's a lot of things that are

5968
02:28:27,411 --> 02:28:28,244
really true.

5969
02:28:28,600 --> 02:28:28,840
The,

5970
02:28:28,840 --> 02:28:29,020
the,

5971
02:28:29,020 --> 02:28:29,211
the,

5972
02:28:29,211 --> 02:28:29,481
the,

5973
02:28:29,481 --> 02:28:31,910
the myths are that he's
this fucking tyrant that,

5974
02:28:32,180 --> 02:28:32,451
you know,

5975
02:28:32,451 --> 02:28:35,270
he wants to go out and destroy people's
lives and wants to do this and that and

5976
02:28:35,271 --> 02:28:36,104
all this other shit.

5977
02:28:36,200 --> 02:28:37,760
And then there's guys who fuck with us.

5978
02:28:38,300 --> 02:28:38,690
You know,

5979
02:28:38,690 --> 02:28:40,670
if you want to pick a fight with us,

5980
02:28:41,410 --> 02:28:42,710
they weren't going to fucking fight

5981
02:28:42,900 --> 02:28:43,291
difference.

5982
02:28:43,291 --> 02:28:44,140
And people understand,

5983
02:28:44,210 --> 02:28:46,980
have to understand that there's a big
difference between someone who's an

5984
02:28:46,981 --> 02:28:49,620
asshole and someone who just
doesn't like to be fucked with.

5985
02:28:49,680 --> 02:28:49,810
Yeah,

5986
02:28:49,810 --> 02:28:50,700
there's a big difference.

5987
02:28:50,940 --> 02:28:51,421
You're,

5988
02:28:51,421 --> 02:28:51,811
I mean,

5989
02:28:51,811 --> 02:28:52,461
and I'm just,

5990
02:28:52,461 --> 02:28:53,820
I'm not just saying this
because you're here.

5991
02:28:54,060 --> 02:28:56,310
You are remarkably nice person.

5992
02:28:56,520 --> 02:28:59,880
I've seen you deal with
fans and this is like,

5993
02:29:00,030 --> 02:29:00,221
oh,

5994
02:29:00,221 --> 02:29:00,980
you're cute.

5995
02:29:00,980 --> 02:29:01,390
Boris.

5996
02:29:01,390 --> 02:29:04,910
Is this on the Pug Dude?

5997
02:29:04,911 --> 02:29:06,800
If anybody says anything nice about me,

5998
02:29:06,801 --> 02:29:08,120
you're kissing my fucking ass.

5999
02:29:08,121 --> 02:29:08,860
It's like truth.

6000
02:29:08,860 --> 02:29:10,870
But that situation,

6001
02:29:10,990 --> 02:29:11,730
you,

6002
02:29:11,730 --> 02:29:12,041
you know,

6003
02:29:12,041 --> 02:29:12,241
you,

6004
02:29:12,241 --> 02:29:14,590
you've handled it remarkably well.

6005
02:29:14,800 --> 02:29:15,190
You know,

6006
02:29:15,190 --> 02:29:16,570
we're remarkably well,

6007
02:29:16,750 --> 02:29:20,830
but when you get fucked with you
go crazy and you go over forward,

6008
02:29:21,290 --> 02:29:22,370
there's no doubt about it not,

6009
02:29:22,371 --> 02:29:23,690
and I'll admit to go to war,

6010
02:29:23,691 --> 02:29:24,321
there's no doubt.

6011
02:29:24,321 --> 02:29:25,260
And I will admit to that,

6012
02:29:25,261 --> 02:29:25,651
that it's,

6013
02:29:25,651 --> 02:29:26,484
it's probably like,

6014
02:29:26,960 --> 02:29:29,660
I don't know if it's my biggest
flaw or my biggest strength.

6015
02:29:30,050 --> 02:29:30,750
I taught

6016
02:29:30,750 --> 02:29:32,060
Dana White and the,

6017
02:29:32,070 --> 02:29:32,791
it was like,

6018
02:29:32,791 --> 02:29:33,780
I don't know what time it was.

6019
02:29:33,781 --> 02:29:35,940
It was late at night and I said,

6020
02:29:35,941 --> 02:29:36,211
uh,

6021
02:29:36,211 --> 02:29:37,200
I guess you,

6022
02:29:37,201 --> 02:29:37,470
uh,

6023
02:29:37,470 --> 02:29:39,210
I guess your fucking
celebrating right now.

6024
02:29:39,280 --> 02:29:42,780
It was right after Josh Barnett pissed
positive and they canceled the fade or

6025
02:29:42,781 --> 02:29:43,410
fight.

6026
02:29:43,410 --> 02:29:43,861
And you were like,

6027
02:29:43,861 --> 02:29:44,221
what?

6028
02:29:44,221 --> 02:29:45,210
I'm gambling right now.

6029
02:29:45,211 --> 02:29:46,080
What the fuck is going?

6030
02:29:46,760 --> 02:29:47,880
Never that like it was yesterday.

6031
02:29:48,260 --> 02:29:49,980
Fucking sit at the thing playing cards,

6032
02:29:49,981 --> 02:29:50,370
man.

6033
02:29:50,370 --> 02:29:51,970
And I don't ever answer my fucking phone.

6034
02:29:51,971 --> 02:29:52,290
I'm putting in,

6035
02:29:52,290 --> 02:29:52,650
I'm like,

6036
02:29:52,650 --> 02:29:53,191
oh fuck.

6037
02:29:53,191 --> 02:29:54,024
Rogan's calling me.

6038
02:29:54,240 --> 02:29:55,140
Why the fuck are broken?

6039
02:29:55,141 --> 02:29:55,651
Be calling me this,

6040
02:29:55,651 --> 02:29:56,484
this can't be good.

6041
02:29:56,760 --> 02:29:57,321
So you told me.

6042
02:29:57,321 --> 02:29:57,631
He's like,

6043
02:29:57,631 --> 02:29:58,111
he pissed.

6044
02:29:58,111 --> 02:29:58,500
I'm like,

6045
02:29:58,500 --> 02:29:59,333
what?

6046
02:29:59,370 --> 02:30:00,330
Like who went crazy?

6047
02:30:00,350 --> 02:30:03,990
I left my fucking chips on the table
and walk the fuck out of the place.

6048
02:30:04,050 --> 02:30:04,710
I remember you called.

6049
02:30:04,710 --> 02:30:06,420
It was shutting him down with buying

6050
02:30:07,950 --> 02:30:08,790
domination.

6051
02:30:08,860 --> 02:30:09,693
It was like her.

6052
02:30:10,950 --> 02:30:12,170
It was like Conan music was,

6053
02:30:12,171 --> 02:30:13,920
what did I say to you that
night when you called me?

6054
02:30:13,921 --> 02:30:14,400
I said,

6055
02:30:14,400 --> 02:30:15,570
you're fucking kidding me.

6056
02:30:15,571 --> 02:30:15,930
He did.

6057
02:30:15,930 --> 02:30:16,351
That's it.

6058
02:30:16,351 --> 02:30:16,741
They're done.

6059
02:30:16,741 --> 02:30:17,190
That debt.

6060
02:30:17,190 --> 02:30:18,023
The debt.

6061
02:30:18,110 --> 02:30:18,660
That was it.

6062
02:30:18,660 --> 02:30:19,800
Josh Barnett just killed him.

6063
02:30:20,180 --> 02:30:21,020
There was that.

6064
02:30:21,080 --> 02:30:22,280
It was a [inaudible] me.

6065
02:30:22,281 --> 02:30:27,020
There's been so many different times
over the past or you've gone to war with

6066
02:30:27,021 --> 02:30:30,650
whoever was running whatever organization
that was trying to fuck with you guys

6067
02:30:30,900 --> 02:30:31,171
and it's,

6068
02:30:31,171 --> 02:30:31,680
and it's,

6069
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:35,460
every guy has had the same ammo that that
we'd done it with it all come out and

6070
02:30:35,461 --> 02:30:36,390
talk shit about us.

6071
02:30:36,391 --> 02:30:36,930
They said,

6072
02:30:36,930 --> 02:30:37,201
yeah,

6073
02:30:37,201 --> 02:30:38,670
these guys don't fucking run it right.

6074
02:30:38,671 --> 02:30:41,310
We're actually going to be good to the
fighters and treat them good and we're

6075
02:30:41,311 --> 02:30:41,910
going to do,

6076
02:30:41,910 --> 02:30:43,950
what the fuck are you talking about?

6077
02:30:43,980 --> 02:30:44,813
The IFL,

6078
02:30:44,820 --> 02:30:44,961
they,

6079
02:30:44,961 --> 02:30:45,661
this wasn't that.

6080
02:30:45,661 --> 02:30:46,391
They're the rap.

6081
02:30:46,391 --> 02:30:48,150
That was the fucking funniest one ever.

6082
02:30:48,151 --> 02:30:51,490
Those guys were fucking
aware of Arizona Wolverines,

6083
02:30:52,650 --> 02:30:56,550
silverbacks bunch of different teams
and that was fucking hilarious.

6084
02:30:56,760 --> 02:31:00,320
Everybody has to try to figure
out their own slice of the,

6085
02:31:00,360 --> 02:31:01,320
that one was fine.

6086
02:31:01,380 --> 02:31:02,880
That one was actually fucking fun.

6087
02:31:02,881 --> 02:31:03,241
It's funny,

6088
02:31:03,241 --> 02:31:04,050
but here's what's,

6089
02:31:04,050 --> 02:31:06,630
what's unnecessary to compete.

6090
02:31:06,631 --> 02:31:07,560
You don't have to talk shit.

6091
02:31:07,980 --> 02:31:08,490
He don't,

6092
02:31:08,490 --> 02:31:09,301
you all you have to do,

6093
02:31:09,301 --> 02:31:09,700
I mean,

6094
02:31:09,700 --> 02:31:11,460
like I've even heard balance or talk shit.

6095
02:31:11,520 --> 02:31:13,140
Why would you do no,

6096
02:31:13,141 --> 02:31:13,231
no,

6097
02:31:13,231 --> 02:31:13,460
no.

6098
02:31:13,460 --> 02:31:13,600
Let,

6099
02:31:13,600 --> 02:31:14,520
let's be fair here.

6100
02:31:14,580 --> 02:31:15,061
Let's be fair.

6101
02:31:15,061 --> 02:31:15,580
You know,

6102
02:31:15,580 --> 02:31:18,610
Bella Tor has made a
couple of snide remarks,

6103
02:31:19,230 --> 02:31:20,220
fucking comments.

6104
02:31:20,221 --> 02:31:20,761
You know what I mean?

6105
02:31:20,761 --> 02:31:21,594
And it happens.

6106
02:31:21,930 --> 02:31:22,763
Uh,

6107
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:28,260
it was the fucking PR guy
over at Spike David Schwartz.

6108
02:31:28,440 --> 02:31:29,640
He's the fucking guy.

6109
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:34,110
He did some fucking punk ass shit
last season of the ultimate fighter.

6110
02:31:34,710 --> 02:31:35,543
And uh,

6111
02:31:36,510 --> 02:31:39,510
so what he was doing was every
time the ratings would come out,

6112
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:41,550
he would send all the fucking,

6113
02:31:41,580 --> 02:31:41,701
oh,

6114
02:31:41,701 --> 02:31:42,990
the media fucking told me,

6115
02:31:43,050 --> 02:31:45,570
you think they're not going to
fucking tell me that you dick.

6116
02:31:45,810 --> 02:31:46,321
You know what I mean?

6117
02:31:46,321 --> 02:31:48,870
They'd tell me what this guy
was doing and I was like,

6118
02:31:48,871 --> 02:31:49,141
all right,

6119
02:31:49,141 --> 02:31:49,800
what was he doing?

6120
02:31:49,800 --> 02:31:51,120
He was sending them all the ratings.

6121
02:31:51,150 --> 02:31:51,600
Oh,

6122
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:51,960
UFC,

6123
02:31:51,960 --> 02:31:52,601
it's tanking.

6124
02:31:52,601 --> 02:31:53,371
It's fucking tank.

6125
02:31:53,371 --> 02:31:53,860
And Oh,

6126
02:31:53,860 --> 02:31:54,270
so the,

6127
02:31:54,270 --> 02:31:54,830
okay.

6128
02:31:54,830 --> 02:31:57,540
The ultimate fighter doesn't work now
over there playing it to everybody.

6129
02:31:57,540 --> 02:32:00,450
This was when you guys had
already been on your way out.

6130
02:32:00,451 --> 02:32:01,260
So No.

6131
02:32:01,260 --> 02:32:01,531
All right.

6132
02:32:01,531 --> 02:32:01,761
So,

6133
02:32:01,761 --> 02:32:03,150
so everybody understands when,

6134
02:32:03,151 --> 02:32:06,150
when we found out that
we weren't doing a deal,

6135
02:32:06,700 --> 02:32:11,700
my beef is not with Bella Tor or
Bjork or any of those guys over there.

6136
02:32:12,630 --> 02:32:13,441
Not My beef.

6137
02:32:13,441 --> 02:32:14,280
His name is Bjorn,

6138
02:32:14,430 --> 02:32:15,390
Bjorn [inaudible].

6139
02:32:15,450 --> 02:32:15,570
He,

6140
02:32:15,570 --> 02:32:17,970
it's not my beef with them that,

6141
02:32:18,010 --> 02:32:19,680
that guys never really said anything.

6142
02:32:19,681 --> 02:32:21,630
He's had a couple of
little things that he said,

6143
02:32:21,631 --> 02:32:22,230
you know,

6144
02:32:22,230 --> 02:32:22,411
and,

6145
02:32:22,411 --> 02:32:22,621
and,

6146
02:32:22,621 --> 02:32:23,454
and that's,

6147
02:32:23,640 --> 02:32:25,500
that's the whole a spike.

6148
02:32:25,860 --> 02:32:26,191
You know,

6149
02:32:26,191 --> 02:32:27,024
we want to,

6150
02:32:27,480 --> 02:32:28,290
there's a guy,

6151
02:32:28,290 --> 02:32:29,760
his name is Felipe Dumont.

6152
02:32:30,420 --> 02:32:31,110
Okay.

6153
02:32:31,110 --> 02:32:32,670
This guy runs Viacom.

6154
02:32:33,870 --> 02:32:34,703
Viacom.

6155
02:32:34,800 --> 02:32:37,830
The two guys who run Viacom couldn't
get along and got split down the middle.

6156
02:32:38,790 --> 02:32:39,623
Uh,

6157
02:32:39,630 --> 02:32:41,630
he runs Viacom,

6158
02:32:41,640 --> 02:32:42,930
which is spike MTV,

6159
02:32:42,931 --> 02:32:43,651
comedy central,

6160
02:32:43,651 --> 02:32:45,300
Nickelodeon and all that stuff.

6161
02:32:45,960 --> 02:32:48,690
Les Moonves runs CBS.

6162
02:32:49,110 --> 02:32:49,890
Okay.

6163
02:32:49,890 --> 02:32:51,390
So this guy,

6164
02:32:51,391 --> 02:32:52,290
Felipe doom on,

6165
02:32:52,710 --> 02:32:53,160
uh,

6166
02:32:53,160 --> 02:32:58,160
we start into our negotiations for our
new contract and this guy basically says

6167
02:32:58,501 --> 02:32:58,891
to us,

6168
02:32:58,891 --> 02:32:59,700
uh,

6169
02:32:59,700 --> 02:33:00,533
here's the deal,

6170
02:33:00,690 --> 02:33:04,860
sign it by tomorrow or fuck you
the fuck kind of shit is that?

6171
02:33:05,400 --> 02:33:05,850
This is,

6172
02:33:05,850 --> 02:33:06,080
yeah.

6173
02:33:06,080 --> 02:33:07,890
Through all those years
of being in business,

6174
02:33:08,360 --> 02:33:12,780
and I have a great working
relationship with spike,

6175
02:33:12,990 --> 02:33:15,360
with Kevin k with Doug Herzog,

6176
02:33:15,361 --> 02:33:17,040
the guy who runs comedy central and spike.

6177
02:33:18,150 --> 02:33:19,200
So this guy's like,

6178
02:33:19,201 --> 02:33:20,034
yeah,

6179
02:33:20,070 --> 02:33:20,810
fuck you.

6180
02:33:20,810 --> 02:33:22,860
We built you and what?

6181
02:33:22,861 --> 02:33:23,790
We'll just build another one,

6182
02:33:24,990 --> 02:33:25,380
you know,

6183
02:33:25,380 --> 02:33:25,690
and,

6184
02:33:25,690 --> 02:33:27,390
and the way that we are,

6185
02:33:28,340 --> 02:33:31,490
we're like fuck you the fuck
do you think you're talking?

6186
02:33:31,491 --> 02:33:32,310
He fucking,

6187
02:33:32,310 --> 02:33:32,940
you know what I mean?

6188
02:33:32,940 --> 02:33:34,470
You fucking built the UFC,

6189
02:33:34,471 --> 02:33:35,304
you piece of shit.

6190
02:33:35,760 --> 02:33:35,971
No,

6191
02:33:35,971 --> 02:33:36,900
you fucking didn't.

6192
02:33:37,440 --> 02:33:38,160
You know,

6193
02:33:38,160 --> 02:33:41,940
and so we knew we weren't
signing with these guys.

6194
02:33:42,570 --> 02:33:43,370
We knew we weren't signing.

6195
02:33:43,370 --> 02:33:44,640
So as soon as we're not signing,

6196
02:33:45,330 --> 02:33:46,530
they shut the faucet off.

6197
02:33:47,130 --> 02:33:51,390
All the things that we used to be able
to do on spike was done six months before

6198
02:33:51,391 --> 02:33:52,224
we were even gone.

6199
02:33:52,860 --> 02:33:53,693
Right.

6200
02:33:53,730 --> 02:33:56,870
So we go out and start shopping around.

6201
02:33:56,910 --> 02:33:58,440
We start talking to all the big guys.

6202
02:33:58,620 --> 02:33:59,960
We ended up doing this deal with,

6203
02:34:00,150 --> 02:34:01,470
with a Fox,

6204
02:34:01,740 --> 02:34:02,280
right?

6205
02:34:02,280 --> 02:34:03,930
We end up doing this great deal with Fox.

6206
02:34:04,050 --> 02:34:05,220
They're the greatest guys in the world.

6207
02:34:05,221 --> 02:34:06,054
Everything's great.

6208
02:34:06,180 --> 02:34:11,180
And now these guys start acting
like fucking a crazy ex girlfriend,

6209
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:13,711
you know what I mean?

6210
02:34:13,711 --> 02:34:14,460
Like they wanted,

6211
02:34:14,460 --> 02:34:15,900
I said we went with somebody else.

6212
02:34:16,590 --> 02:34:16,800
No,

6213
02:34:16,800 --> 02:34:16,951
you,

6214
02:34:16,951 --> 02:34:17,620
what were they doing?

6215
02:34:17,620 --> 02:34:17,711
No,

6216
02:34:17,711 --> 02:34:18,220
you fucking

6217
02:34:18,220 --> 02:34:21,850
shit on us and disrespected us and
treated us like fucking assholes.

6218
02:34:21,851 --> 02:34:23,440
And then said you built the UFC.

6219
02:34:23,500 --> 02:34:24,790
Well this is all this one guy though.

6220
02:34:24,850 --> 02:34:25,390
Yeah.

6221
02:34:25,390 --> 02:34:26,140
That one guy.

6222
02:34:26,140 --> 02:34:26,351
Yeah,

6223
02:34:26,351 --> 02:34:27,100
Felipe Dumont.

6224
02:34:27,100 --> 02:34:29,740
So how's it going to get
to be ahead of Viacom?

6225
02:34:29,741 --> 02:34:30,470
How's that work?

6226
02:34:30,470 --> 02:34:31,510
I don't know how that works.

6227
02:34:31,540 --> 02:34:33,580
His real name is fillings
from fucking New Jersey.

6228
02:34:33,800 --> 02:34:34,330
Okay.

6229
02:34:34,330 --> 02:34:34,691
Wait a minute.

6230
02:34:34,691 --> 02:34:34,920
Yeah.

6231
02:34:34,920 --> 02:34:35,371
Full leap.

6232
02:34:35,371 --> 02:34:37,390
Duwan sounds like he's from
fucking France or something,

6233
02:34:37,391 --> 02:34:37,601
right?

6234
02:34:37,601 --> 02:34:38,050
He's here.

6235
02:34:38,050 --> 02:34:38,820
Yeah.

6236
02:34:38,820 --> 02:34:39,030
Wait,

6237
02:34:39,030 --> 02:34:39,580
in Israel.

6238
02:34:39,580 --> 02:34:40,500
His name is not Felipe.

6239
02:34:40,540 --> 02:34:41,050
Yeah,

6240
02:34:41,050 --> 02:34:41,883
it's Phil.

6241
02:34:42,130 --> 02:34:42,963
He's from New Jersey.

6242
02:34:43,550 --> 02:34:44,540
I'm decided to fucking,

6243
02:34:44,740 --> 02:34:45,580
I bust his balls.

6244
02:34:45,581 --> 02:34:46,414
I don't know.

6245
02:34:46,810 --> 02:34:47,643
I like that.

6246
02:34:48,700 --> 02:34:49,960
Put It on line because gentlemen,

6247
02:34:50,380 --> 02:34:51,760
so Jerry Rice,

6248
02:34:51,761 --> 02:34:52,361
what was his name?

6249
02:34:52,361 --> 02:34:53,550
The guy from Jerry Millen.

6250
02:34:53,830 --> 02:34:54,320
Yeah.

6251
02:34:54,320 --> 02:34:54,920
Yeah.

6252
02:34:54,920 --> 02:34:55,930
Wasn't that true with him?

6253
02:34:55,931 --> 02:34:57,040
Where the fuck is that guy?

6254
02:34:57,280 --> 02:34:57,520
Yeah,

6255
02:34:57,520 --> 02:34:58,210
exactly.

6256
02:34:58,210 --> 02:34:58,601
But didn't,

6257
02:34:58,601 --> 02:34:59,290
that guy wouldn't,

6258
02:34:59,290 --> 02:35:01,510
didn't like boss route and said
that that wasn't his real name.

6259
02:35:01,510 --> 02:35:02,380
Like it changes name.

6260
02:35:02,410 --> 02:35:02,941
Oh yeah,

6261
02:35:02,941 --> 02:35:03,161
yeah,

6262
02:35:03,161 --> 02:35:03,461
yeah,

6263
02:35:03,461 --> 02:35:03,791
I did.

6264
02:35:03,791 --> 02:35:04,624
I did hear that.

6265
02:35:04,690 --> 02:35:04,841
Oh,

6266
02:35:04,841 --> 02:35:05,674
me and him.

6267
02:35:05,710 --> 02:35:06,430
Yeah.

6268
02:35:06,430 --> 02:35:08,830
Well I know we've had some
the whole thing with your mom.

6269
02:35:08,860 --> 02:35:09,550
Yeah,

6270
02:35:09,550 --> 02:35:10,181
exactly.

6271
02:35:10,181 --> 02:35:10,661
That's sick.

6272
02:35:10,661 --> 02:35:11,470
Fuck that.

6273
02:35:11,470 --> 02:35:14,440
I wouldn't do that to my
worst enemy interviews.

6274
02:35:14,441 --> 02:35:15,130
Your mom.

6275
02:35:15,130 --> 02:35:15,760
Yeah,

6276
02:35:15,760 --> 02:35:16,090
no,

6277
02:35:16,090 --> 02:35:17,110
they did some low shit,

6278
02:35:17,111 --> 02:35:17,350
man.

6279
02:35:17,350 --> 02:35:18,730
That other,

6280
02:35:18,731 --> 02:35:20,020
other competitors have tried to do.

6281
02:35:20,021 --> 02:35:20,854
Shit.

6282
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:21,550
It's parent.

6283
02:35:21,550 --> 02:35:22,930
My mom will go as low as she can go.

6284
02:35:22,931 --> 02:35:23,830
So you know,

6285
02:35:23,831 --> 02:35:25,630
anybody who wants to try to whatever,

6286
02:35:25,660 --> 02:35:26,493
it's just,

6287
02:35:27,370 --> 02:35:28,390
that's gotta be cute.

6288
02:35:28,440 --> 02:35:29,273
So,

6289
02:35:29,830 --> 02:35:32,950
so we ended up doing this deal of
Fox and these guys start acting like,

6290
02:35:33,010 --> 02:35:33,730
you know,

6291
02:35:33,730 --> 02:35:35,410
like we did something wrong to them.

6292
02:35:35,411 --> 02:35:35,521
And,

6293
02:35:35,521 --> 02:35:35,691
and,

6294
02:35:35,691 --> 02:35:36,910
and even the guys at spike,

6295
02:35:37,150 --> 02:35:38,080
like David Schwartz,

6296
02:35:38,081 --> 02:35:38,411
you know,

6297
02:35:38,411 --> 02:35:40,990
I worked with this guy
for six years and that,

6298
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:42,490
and now you're really
going to do that to us.

6299
02:35:42,490 --> 02:35:42,681
You're gonna,

6300
02:35:42,681 --> 02:35:42,951
you're gonna,

6301
02:35:42,951 --> 02:35:45,280
you're gonna send out these
things and put out these,

6302
02:35:45,380 --> 02:35:49,810
when people don't know the fall is
probably trying to protect his job.

6303
02:35:49,811 --> 02:35:52,800
And maybe guy like Felipe Dumont was
telling them to do something on an fit.

6304
02:35:52,810 --> 02:35:54,510
Felipe doesn't fucking
these things not look,

6305
02:35:54,511 --> 02:35:57,200
he says let's do this and they make
this decision to buy this thing and,

6306
02:35:57,560 --> 02:35:57,720
and,

6307
02:35:57,720 --> 02:35:58,421
and do whatever.

6308
02:35:58,421 --> 02:35:58,710
You know,

6309
02:35:58,710 --> 02:36:01,360
he's not involved in
the day to day at Spike.

6310
02:36:01,390 --> 02:36:03,140
They spent 50 million for Bella tour.

6311
02:36:03,520 --> 02:36:04,420
I don't know about that.

6312
02:36:04,450 --> 02:36:04,760
You don't know.

6313
02:36:04,760 --> 02:36:05,910
But a lot of people don't really,

6314
02:36:05,911 --> 02:36:06,130
well,

6315
02:36:06,130 --> 02:36:07,400
there was a lot of you,

6316
02:36:07,420 --> 02:36:08,253
do you think that,

6317
02:36:09,100 --> 02:36:10,870
I don't know how much money,

6318
02:36:11,230 --> 02:36:11,870
uh,

6319
02:36:11,870 --> 02:36:12,190
the,

6320
02:36:12,190 --> 02:36:12,471
the,

6321
02:36:12,471 --> 02:36:13,810
the Bjorn guy put in himself,

6322
02:36:13,811 --> 02:36:15,790
but there were a lot of investors,

6323
02:36:16,140 --> 02:36:16,690
um,

6324
02:36:16,690 --> 02:36:17,930
and uh,

6325
02:36:17,950 --> 02:36:20,410
Viacom had to go buy
out all the investors.

6326
02:36:20,560 --> 02:36:21,393
Right?

6327
02:36:21,820 --> 02:36:22,151
What,

6328
02:36:22,151 --> 02:36:22,810
50 billion?

6329
02:36:22,810 --> 02:36:23,470
I don't know.

6330
02:36:23,470 --> 02:36:23,870
You know,

6331
02:36:23,870 --> 02:36:24,760
it depends on what number.

6332
02:36:24,760 --> 02:36:24,981
I,

6333
02:36:24,981 --> 02:36:26,050
I don't believe that number.

6334
02:36:26,200 --> 02:36:28,030
Do you think Viacom's running it now?

6335
02:36:28,510 --> 02:36:28,930
Oh yeah.

6336
02:36:28,930 --> 02:36:29,763
Hundred percent.

6337
02:36:29,950 --> 02:36:30,370
Oh yeah.

6338
02:36:30,370 --> 02:36:32,320
So what does Bjorn,

6339
02:36:32,321 --> 02:36:33,310
a figurehead,

6340
02:36:33,340 --> 02:36:33,790
those guys,

6341
02:36:33,790 --> 02:36:34,623
those guys are,

6342
02:36:34,820 --> 02:36:35,210
they,

6343
02:36:35,210 --> 02:36:36,520
they own the majority of the company.

6344
02:36:36,540 --> 02:36:38,080
Then they're making the
decisions over there.

6345
02:36:38,260 --> 02:36:40,840
I'm sure that guy is over there putting
together fights and doing whatever.

6346
02:36:40,841 --> 02:36:42,250
But let me tell you what there,

6347
02:36:42,300 --> 02:36:42,800
there's,

6348
02:36:42,800 --> 02:36:43,450
there's,

6349
02:36:43,450 --> 02:36:44,470
there's a guy over there.

6350
02:36:44,471 --> 02:36:45,610
What the Hell is his name?

6351
02:36:45,680 --> 02:36:46,513
Uh,

6352
02:36:46,830 --> 02:36:47,800
there's a guy over there.

6353
02:36:47,801 --> 02:36:48,311
Let me remember.

6354
02:36:48,311 --> 02:36:50,920
He was a fucking super sharp dude.

6355
02:36:50,921 --> 02:36:53,230
If I a calm guy over there via comments,

6356
02:36:53,231 --> 02:36:53,541
double,

6357
02:36:53,541 --> 02:36:54,650
triple sharp and he,

6358
02:36:54,690 --> 02:36:55,630
I can't remember his name.

6359
02:36:55,750 --> 02:36:56,260
I know.

6360
02:36:56,260 --> 02:36:57,640
I'll remember suspect for the guy.

6361
02:36:57,641 --> 02:36:57,881
Yeah,

6362
02:36:57,881 --> 02:36:58,310
no,

6363
02:36:58,310 --> 02:36:58,841
I know,

6364
02:36:58,841 --> 02:36:59,674
but I'm so busy.

6365
02:36:59,740 --> 02:37:02,180
Like I'm so bad with names like guys,

6366
02:37:02,240 --> 02:37:03,970
the guy w w with Viacom,

6367
02:37:04,040 --> 02:37:05,110
he's high up guys.

6368
02:37:05,500 --> 02:37:06,333
What's his name?

6369
02:37:06,340 --> 02:37:07,870
I was just talking
about him the other day,

6370
02:37:08,050 --> 02:37:11,470
but this guy is super smart and I
guarantee you if there's anybody that's

6371
02:37:11,471 --> 02:37:13,870
involved in trying to figure
out how to build this thing,

6372
02:37:14,300 --> 02:37:15,880
he's the guy in there doing it.

6373
02:37:17,200 --> 02:37:17,411
Yeah,

6374
02:37:17,411 --> 02:37:17,801
it's a,

6375
02:37:17,801 --> 02:37:19,430
it's a fascinating thing to stay.

6376
02:37:19,431 --> 02:37:19,600
Um,

6377
02:37:19,600 --> 02:37:20,590
I liked Jimmy Smith.

6378
02:37:20,591 --> 02:37:21,850
I think he does a great job,

6379
02:37:21,910 --> 02:37:22,211
you know,

6380
02:37:22,211 --> 02:37:24,610
over at belter and I think
they've got some good fights,

6381
02:37:24,611 --> 02:37:25,510
but it's,

6382
02:37:25,511 --> 02:37:25,870
uh,

6383
02:37:25,870 --> 02:37:30,870
it's so interesting seeing how the
UFC has become like Kleenex or,

6384
02:37:31,320 --> 02:37:31,870
you know,

6385
02:37:31,870 --> 02:37:32,610
uh,

6386
02:37:32,610 --> 02:37:33,550
it's become,

6387
02:37:33,580 --> 02:37:34,450
it's become like

6388
02:37:34,660 --> 02:37:35,190
cute tops.

6389
02:37:35,190 --> 02:37:36,023
I mean,

6390
02:37:36,030 --> 02:37:36,330
it's,

6391
02:37:36,330 --> 02:37:36,981
it's not even,

6392
02:37:36,981 --> 02:37:37,850
it's not even that.

6393
02:37:38,550 --> 02:37:39,383
Well,

6394
02:37:39,690 --> 02:37:39,860
no,

6395
02:37:39,860 --> 02:37:40,221
I agree.

6396
02:37:40,221 --> 02:37:43,520
But what people don't realize
is how hard we work at this.

6397
02:37:44,300 --> 02:37:49,300
It's like we get in that office in the
morning and we're there till fucking late

6398
02:37:49,670 --> 02:37:51,290
at night and everything we do,

6399
02:37:51,510 --> 02:37:51,750
we're,

6400
02:37:51,750 --> 02:37:54,680
we're absolute crazy about man.

6401
02:37:54,880 --> 02:37:55,020
And,

6402
02:37:55,020 --> 02:37:55,230
and,

6403
02:37:55,230 --> 02:37:57,340
and while building the business
and dealing with all the,

6404
02:37:57,580 --> 02:37:57,750
the,

6405
02:37:57,750 --> 02:37:59,780
the goofy shit that happens every day.

6406
02:38:00,160 --> 02:38:04,280
I'm putting out fires and things that
just happen dealing with the fucking

6407
02:38:04,550 --> 02:38:06,530
Culinary Union scumbags and,

6408
02:38:06,870 --> 02:38:07,400
uh,

6409
02:38:07,400 --> 02:38:08,240
all that stuff.

6410
02:38:08,540 --> 02:38:09,373
You know,

6411
02:38:09,800 --> 02:38:11,060
we still have to grow the business.

6412
02:38:11,061 --> 02:38:12,410
We still have to get
out there and do deals.

6413
02:38:12,411 --> 02:38:13,670
And it's crazy,

6414
02:38:13,671 --> 02:38:13,821
man.

6415
02:38:13,821 --> 02:38:14,750
It just never stops.

6416
02:38:14,751 --> 02:38:18,350
Thing is like a little baby
that you just can't leave alone.

6417
02:38:18,351 --> 02:38:19,460
You have to take care of it.

6418
02:38:19,461 --> 02:38:19,881
24,

6419
02:38:19,881 --> 02:38:20,714
seven.

6420
02:38:20,780 --> 02:38:21,081
Yeah.

6421
02:38:21,081 --> 02:38:22,040
It's a crazy fucker.

6422
02:38:22,041 --> 02:38:22,874
Never sleeps.

6423
02:38:22,980 --> 02:38:23,761
People don't know that.

6424
02:38:23,761 --> 02:38:25,070
The culinary business thing,

6425
02:38:25,520 --> 02:38:28,010
if folks don't know what
you're talking about,

6426
02:38:28,040 --> 02:38:33,040
the culinary union is been trying to
get the UFC shutdown because the UFC is

6427
02:38:33,531 --> 02:38:34,710
owned by [inaudible],

6428
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:38,390
which is owned by the Fertittas
who also own station casinos,

6429
02:38:38,391 --> 02:38:39,460
which are non union.

6430
02:38:39,590 --> 02:38:41,630
The Culinary Union withstand a profit.

6431
02:38:41,631 --> 02:38:42,464
How much

6432
02:38:42,980 --> 02:38:45,140
the number is like 11 million a year,

6433
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:47,420
11 million a year if they,

6434
02:38:47,421 --> 02:38:47,960
uh,

6435
02:38:47,960 --> 02:38:49,370
if they can get station casinos.

6436
02:38:49,430 --> 02:38:52,130
So they just constantly torment every day,

6437
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:53,390
every day something goes out.

6438
02:38:53,630 --> 02:38:55,070
Right before I left here,

6439
02:38:55,580 --> 02:38:59,750
there was a flyer that came out where
they took a quote from Chael Sonnen and

6440
02:38:59,751 --> 02:38:59,991
uh,

6441
02:38:59,991 --> 02:39:00,291
you know,

6442
02:39:00,291 --> 02:39:03,880
it was channel on one of his
rants at a Q and a and uh,

6443
02:39:03,930 --> 02:39:04,260
they,

6444
02:39:04,260 --> 02:39:04,700
they,

6445
02:39:04,700 --> 02:39:08,570
they put together a flyer and
they send it out to sponsors,

6446
02:39:08,571 --> 02:39:09,470
television networks,

6447
02:39:09,471 --> 02:39:10,304
everybody and they,

6448
02:39:10,350 --> 02:39:12,980
they do this every day and I'm
a fucking gold mine for them.

6449
02:39:12,981 --> 02:39:14,930
So I'm an every one of their flyers.

6450
02:39:14,931 --> 02:39:16,910
They created a website
about me and everything,

6451
02:39:17,240 --> 02:39:19,710
but it's amazing that anybody would even
listen to them at this point in time,

6452
02:39:19,711 --> 02:39:20,544
how much

6453
02:39:20,680 --> 02:39:21,450
they're losing.

6454
02:39:21,450 --> 02:39:22,620
They're losing tons of respect.

6455
02:39:22,621 --> 02:39:22,780
Yeah,

6456
02:39:22,780 --> 02:39:23,590
they're losing.

6457
02:39:23,590 --> 02:39:23,940
Yeah.

6458
02:39:23,940 --> 02:39:24,360
It's cool.

6459
02:39:24,360 --> 02:39:25,000
It's so true.

6460
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:25,350
Parents.

6461
02:39:25,350 --> 02:39:25,471
Oh,

6462
02:39:25,471 --> 02:39:26,071
there's no doubt.

6463
02:39:26,071 --> 02:39:26,191
And,

6464
02:39:26,191 --> 02:39:26,271
and,

6465
02:39:26,271 --> 02:39:28,230
and as we continue to talk to,

6466
02:39:28,231 --> 02:39:28,830
uh,

6467
02:39:28,830 --> 02:39:29,663
a lot of the,

6468
02:39:30,540 --> 02:39:30,751
you know,

6469
02:39:30,751 --> 02:39:33,030
the sponsors and television networks
and everything that happens,

6470
02:39:33,210 --> 02:39:36,060
they actually can't stand the union now.

6471
02:39:36,300 --> 02:39:36,451
Well,

6472
02:39:36,451 --> 02:39:38,070
it's gangsterism oh dude,

6473
02:39:38,250 --> 02:39:39,840
these guys actually have gangster routes.

6474
02:39:39,841 --> 02:39:41,310
This is these guys literally,

6475
02:39:41,400 --> 02:39:42,720
I'm going to pull up the lineage of,

6476
02:39:42,721 --> 02:39:44,370
of the Las Vegas Culinary Union.

6477
02:39:44,520 --> 02:39:45,360
I want to get it to you.

6478
02:39:45,361 --> 02:39:47,880
It'd be great for you to read
gangsters killing people.

6479
02:39:47,881 --> 02:39:48,511
And Yeah,

6480
02:39:48,511 --> 02:39:53,511
literally gangsters is 11 million a year
and then go in union and the workers at

6481
02:39:53,941 --> 02:39:55,560
the casinos don't want this apparently.

6482
02:39:55,561 --> 02:39:56,670
Is that the case?

6483
02:39:56,671 --> 02:39:57,481
Or is exactly,

6484
02:39:57,481 --> 02:39:58,051
is that what they said?

6485
02:39:58,051 --> 02:39:58,501
Exactly.

6486
02:39:58,501 --> 02:40:01,080
Even if there's a story
even about the MGM,

6487
02:40:01,320 --> 02:40:03,750
how they ended up coming to
some deal with the union.

6488
02:40:03,990 --> 02:40:07,290
So what they do is they let the union
come into the hotel to get people to sign

6489
02:40:07,291 --> 02:40:07,680
up.

6490
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:09,060
It took four years,

6491
02:40:10,230 --> 02:40:10,531
you know,

6492
02:40:10,531 --> 02:40:12,180
they're in the fucking kitchen,

6493
02:40:12,450 --> 02:40:12,661
you know,

6494
02:40:12,661 --> 02:40:13,860
down with people eat everyday,

6495
02:40:13,861 --> 02:40:15,300
terrorizing the people to sign.

6496
02:40:15,670 --> 02:40:16,080
Wow.

6497
02:40:16,080 --> 02:40:16,321
Yeah.

6498
02:40:16,321 --> 02:40:17,340
It's a fucking nightmare,

6499
02:40:17,341 --> 02:40:17,580
man.

6500
02:40:17,580 --> 02:40:18,181
Bad people.

6501
02:40:18,181 --> 02:40:19,014
They're bad people.

6502
02:40:19,110 --> 02:40:19,380
Well,

6503
02:40:19,380 --> 02:40:20,810
Vegas has a map,

6504
02:40:20,840 --> 02:40:21,660
then they start,

6505
02:40:21,660 --> 02:40:23,460
then they start like for instance,

6506
02:40:23,461 --> 02:40:25,110
man fucking Mandy Moore,

6507
02:40:25,140 --> 02:40:25,770
right?

6508
02:40:25,770 --> 02:40:29,130
Mandy Moore is one of the
sweetest people you'll ever meet.

6509
02:40:29,160 --> 02:40:29,640
Yeah.

6510
02:40:29,640 --> 02:40:31,410
One of the nicest fucking people.

6511
02:40:31,500 --> 02:40:34,200
And one of the most
unlikely UFC fans on earth.

6512
02:40:34,360 --> 02:40:35,193
Right?

6513
02:40:35,370 --> 02:40:36,300
Fucking sweetheart.

6514
02:40:36,450 --> 02:40:37,283
The girl is,

6515
02:40:37,380 --> 02:40:38,730
if you ever talked to her,

6516
02:40:38,740 --> 02:40:40,680
there's not a bad bone
in her fucking body.

6517
02:40:41,100 --> 02:40:42,690
These fucking piece of shit.

6518
02:40:42,691 --> 02:40:47,040
Scum bags start hammering Disney going.

6519
02:40:47,070 --> 02:40:49,050
Cause you know she did that movie tangled.

6520
02:40:49,740 --> 02:40:54,360
How could you be in business with somebody
like Mandy Moore who supports the UFC

6521
02:40:54,480 --> 02:40:57,480
and did you know that they're against
gay people and did you know that they,

6522
02:40:57,600 --> 02:40:59,190
that they fucking hate black people.

6523
02:40:59,191 --> 02:41:01,350
And did you know that they
hate fucking yellow people?

6524
02:41:01,410 --> 02:41:02,041
And did you know that,

6525
02:41:02,041 --> 02:41:02,401
that this,

6526
02:41:02,401 --> 02:41:04,950
that and did you know that the
guy who runs it swears and he,

6527
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:10,000
and he's like a ball Nazi and like
all this fucking shit they send it to,

6528
02:41:10,001 --> 02:41:10,250
to,

6529
02:41:10,250 --> 02:41:10,530
to,

6530
02:41:10,530 --> 02:41:12,510
to Disney about Mandy Moore.

6531
02:41:12,810 --> 02:41:17,810
What kind of a fucking piece of shit do
you need to be to fucking do that demand

6532
02:41:18,010 --> 02:41:18,470
anymore?

6533
02:41:18,470 --> 02:41:19,490
This is a strange,

6534
02:41:19,491 --> 02:41:20,510
strange place.

6535
02:41:20,511 --> 02:41:24,080
And the fact that that can still
exist in a place like Vegas.

6536
02:41:24,350 --> 02:41:29,330
Vegas has so much old school about it
when it comes to to that kind of stuff.

6537
02:41:29,370 --> 02:41:30,080
That's true.

6538
02:41:30,080 --> 02:41:31,670
And which people are so scummy.

6539
02:41:31,700 --> 02:41:33,230
Do you like living there,

6540
02:41:33,260 --> 02:41:33,740
don't you?

6541
02:41:33,740 --> 02:41:34,573
I do

6542
02:41:36,670 --> 02:41:39,350
think about doing a weekly show.

6543
02:41:39,380 --> 02:41:42,140
I think about like if I had
like a weekly show at a casino,

6544
02:41:42,380 --> 02:41:46,190
like I could do like a smaller casino or
like a hard rock type of thing and have

6545
02:41:46,191 --> 02:41:47,300
some kind of a weekly show.

6546
02:41:47,450 --> 02:41:48,290
What would that be like?

6547
02:41:48,320 --> 02:41:50,070
I think you'd be able
to live in I think then.

6548
02:41:50,450 --> 02:41:50,751
Yeah,

6549
02:41:50,751 --> 02:41:52,490
but I don't think I could live there.

6550
02:41:52,520 --> 02:41:52,611
Oh,

6551
02:41:52,611 --> 02:41:53,301
you mean live there?

6552
02:41:53,301 --> 02:41:53,600
No,

6553
02:41:53,600 --> 02:41:54,440
can never live Joe.

6554
02:41:54,441 --> 02:41:55,274
Let me tell you what,

6555
02:41:55,280 --> 02:41:56,450
if you lived in Vegas,

6556
02:41:56,451 --> 02:41:58,250
you could set up a shop just like this.

6557
02:41:59,210 --> 02:41:59,720
Uh,

6558
02:41:59,720 --> 02:42:00,081
you know,

6559
02:42:00,081 --> 02:42:01,070
even bigger and better.

6560
02:42:01,071 --> 02:42:01,904
I'd be cheaper.

6561
02:42:02,030 --> 02:42:03,080
There's no taxes.

6562
02:42:03,260 --> 02:42:03,500
You know,

6563
02:42:03,500 --> 02:42:04,710
you pay no state tax down,

6564
02:42:04,730 --> 02:42:06,110
but you've got to live in Vegas,

6565
02:42:06,440 --> 02:42:07,520
but when you live there,

6566
02:42:07,880 --> 02:42:10,340
you can stay away from the Strip and
all that shit and not even know you're

6567
02:42:10,341 --> 02:42:10,670
there.

6568
02:42:10,670 --> 02:42:12,290
It's like being near Chernobyl.

6569
02:42:12,380 --> 02:42:13,870
You're going to get the residual,

6570
02:42:14,750 --> 02:42:18,610
get the black rain of Vegas lives.

6571
02:42:18,650 --> 02:42:19,361
They're live.

6572
02:42:19,361 --> 02:42:20,600
They're not even ship.

6573
02:42:21,710 --> 02:42:23,450
I'm telling you how far out do you live?

6574
02:42:23,451 --> 02:42:25,100
How far away you are,

6575
02:42:25,101 --> 02:42:26,210
the way you're fucking built.

6576
02:42:26,211 --> 02:42:27,044
There's no way.

6577
02:42:27,200 --> 02:42:28,030
I'm probably,

6578
02:42:28,030 --> 02:42:29,360
I live in what's called Summerlin,

6579
02:42:29,420 --> 02:42:31,520
which is probably 15
minutes away from the strip.

6580
02:42:31,610 --> 02:42:33,020
I would live in the mountains.

6581
02:42:33,030 --> 02:42:35,450
I'd have to get on a
snowmobile to drive you down.

6582
02:42:35,451 --> 02:42:36,620
The way you can take a car.

6583
02:42:36,650 --> 02:42:37,520
You could live on a,

6584
02:42:37,521 --> 02:42:37,791
you know,

6585
02:42:37,791 --> 02:42:38,450
Mt.

6586
02:42:38,450 --> 02:42:38,451
Charleston,

6587
02:42:38,451 --> 02:42:39,770
there's just some cool places up there.

6588
02:42:39,771 --> 02:42:40,970
How far away is that from Vegas?

6589
02:42:41,030 --> 02:42:41,750
20 minutes.

6590
02:42:41,750 --> 02:42:42,590
I still couldn't live there.

6591
02:42:42,591 --> 02:42:43,140
I have kids.

6592
02:42:43,140 --> 02:42:44,390
How do you have your kids in Vegas?

6593
02:42:45,230 --> 02:42:48,200
You don't have any problem
with your kids being near that,

6594
02:42:48,201 --> 02:42:50,630
that fucking giant battery of sin.

6595
02:42:50,660 --> 02:42:51,493
I grew up with big,

6596
02:42:51,500 --> 02:42:52,730
pulsating battery of,

6597
02:42:52,910 --> 02:42:53,743
I grew up there.

6598
02:42:53,970 --> 02:42:55,100
Look how great I turned out.

6599
02:42:57,650 --> 02:42:58,670
I guess if you grew up there,

6600
02:42:58,671 --> 02:42:59,810
you wouldn't be worried about it.

6601
02:42:59,811 --> 02:43:02,060
I'm an alien and looking
at it from the outside,

6602
02:43:02,300 --> 02:43:04,500
I come and tell you what hung over going,

6603
02:43:04,501 --> 02:43:05,660
get me the fuck outta here.

6604
02:43:05,661 --> 02:43:06,920
And I couldn't imagine living there.

6605
02:43:07,600 --> 02:43:08,690
I got a place in Laguna,

6606
02:43:08,840 --> 02:43:09,673
right?

6607
02:43:09,740 --> 02:43:12,580
I've got a house in Vegas
and I got a hundred acres

6608
02:43:12,580 --> 02:43:13,413
in Maine.

6609
02:43:13,420 --> 02:43:14,253
Okay.

6610
02:43:14,530 --> 02:43:15,880
You could fucking live.

6611
02:43:16,240 --> 02:43:18,850
You see the shit that I've seen
happen up in Maine to kids,

6612
02:43:19,180 --> 02:43:20,770
kids getting fucked up on drugs,

6613
02:43:21,340 --> 02:43:22,990
pregnant at fucking 16.

6614
02:43:23,200 --> 02:43:23,740
Um,

6615
02:43:23,740 --> 02:43:24,573
you name it.

6616
02:43:25,140 --> 02:43:26,830
It doesn't matter where you live,

6617
02:43:27,130 --> 02:43:28,990
as long as you stay on top of your kids,

6618
02:43:28,991 --> 02:43:29,501
you've just got to,

6619
02:43:29,501 --> 02:43:29,710
you know,

6620
02:43:29,710 --> 02:43:30,543
stay on him.

6621
02:43:30,550 --> 02:43:31,310
That's true.

6622
02:43:31,310 --> 02:43:31,521
Yeah.

6623
02:43:31,521 --> 02:43:31,821
I mean,

6624
02:43:31,821 --> 02:43:32,120
I would,

6625
02:43:32,120 --> 02:43:35,930
I would imagine at least maybe if they're
aware that something like Vegas exists

6626
02:43:35,931 --> 02:43:36,591
early on,

6627
02:43:36,591 --> 02:43:38,930
maybe there'd be a knock
elated to the pressures,

6628
02:43:39,420 --> 02:43:39,770
you know,

6629
02:43:39,770 --> 02:43:40,161
maybe,

6630
02:43:40,161 --> 02:43:40,580
I don't know.

6631
02:43:40,580 --> 02:43:40,860
Fuck.

6632
02:43:40,860 --> 02:43:41,693
By talking about,

6633
02:43:41,750 --> 02:43:43,310
I wouldn't want to own live in Vegas.

6634
02:43:43,540 --> 02:43:44,210
Yeah.

6635
02:43:44,210 --> 02:43:45,470
But I'd like to do a weekly show there.

6636
02:43:45,790 --> 02:43:47,120
It seems like should be a fun thing to do.

6637
02:43:47,220 --> 02:43:49,740
You should do a residency
somewhere with theater.

6638
02:43:50,210 --> 02:43:51,043
Shut up.

6639
02:43:52,120 --> 02:43:53,010
What do you have to do to do that?

6640
02:43:53,240 --> 02:43:54,073
That's a good room.

6641
02:43:54,100 --> 02:43:54,800
Do you have to hug him?

6642
02:43:54,800 --> 02:43:55,633
No.

6643
02:43:55,790 --> 02:43:55,960
Yeah,

6644
02:43:55,960 --> 02:43:58,520
you did the Louie Anderson
Theater does a good room.

6645
02:43:58,590 --> 02:43:59,160
Yeah.

6646
02:43:59,160 --> 02:43:59,960
That's cool.

6647
02:43:59,960 --> 02:44:00,650
Small,

6648
02:44:00,650 --> 02:44:01,483
but it's nice.

6649
02:44:01,850 --> 02:44:02,720
It's a palace.

6650
02:44:02,780 --> 02:44:05,390
Vegas does not have a lot of
good places to do comedy anymore.

6651
02:44:05,710 --> 02:44:06,320
Yeah.

6652
02:44:06,320 --> 02:44:07,270
They used to have what they did.

6653
02:44:07,271 --> 02:44:08,720
They do a lot of shit at the Mirage.

6654
02:44:08,830 --> 02:44:09,300
Did I?

6655
02:44:09,300 --> 02:44:09,760
Yeah,

6656
02:44:09,760 --> 02:44:10,161
that's right.

6657
02:44:10,161 --> 02:44:10,621
Yeah,

6658
02:44:10,621 --> 02:44:11,630
it has ray Romano.

6659
02:44:11,631 --> 02:44:12,870
They have Kevin and James.

6660
02:44:12,871 --> 02:44:13,400
Yeah,

6661
02:44:13,400 --> 02:44:13,911
they have,

6662
02:44:13,911 --> 02:44:14,450
um,

6663
02:44:14,450 --> 02:44:14,780
um,

6664
02:44:14,780 --> 02:44:15,420
Tosh,

6665
02:44:15,420 --> 02:44:16,253
uh,

6666
02:44:16,670 --> 02:44:17,503
is there,

6667
02:44:17,690 --> 02:44:18,523
um,

6668
02:44:18,610 --> 02:44:19,940
there's a bunch of comedians there.

6669
02:44:20,390 --> 02:44:21,560
They've got a pretty good comedy scene

6670
02:44:23,550 --> 02:44:24,383
or the laugh factory.

6671
02:44:25,070 --> 02:44:26,150
Penn teller likes it.

6672
02:44:26,600 --> 02:44:27,140
Like pen.

6673
02:44:27,140 --> 02:44:28,280
I know Penn for it pretty well.

6674
02:44:28,310 --> 02:44:28,911
He fucking loves,

6675
02:44:28,911 --> 02:44:29,930
I see him every morning.

6676
02:44:30,050 --> 02:44:32,050
His kids get let go to the
same school mind is really.

6677
02:44:32,051 --> 02:44:32,330
Yeah.

6678
02:44:32,330 --> 02:44:33,200
And what kind of school is that?

6679
02:44:33,230 --> 02:44:34,100
Like a private school?

6680
02:44:34,101 --> 02:44:34,640
Yeah.

6681
02:44:34,640 --> 02:44:35,361
What do the kids like?

6682
02:44:35,361 --> 02:44:36,051
Normal kids.

6683
02:44:36,051 --> 02:44:36,321
Yeah.

6684
02:44:36,321 --> 02:44:37,600
It's the greatest private school there.

6685
02:44:37,610 --> 02:44:40,190
There's a fucking freaky
private school there too.

6686
02:44:40,191 --> 02:44:41,240
And my kids started there.

6687
02:44:41,241 --> 02:44:42,610
I got him the fuck out of that place.

6688
02:44:43,250 --> 02:44:43,670
Yeah,

6689
02:44:43,670 --> 02:44:44,930
it was like fucking Germany,

6690
02:44:44,931 --> 02:44:48,260
19 fucking 42 what do
you mean it's just bad?

6691
02:44:48,290 --> 02:44:51,890
Kids aren't allowed to talk at lunch
everywhere they walk in the school,

6692
02:44:51,891 --> 02:44:53,720
they have to walk in a single file line.

6693
02:44:54,410 --> 02:44:56,390
How the fuck do you not talk at lunch?

6694
02:44:56,900 --> 02:44:58,910
Single file line in Vegas.

6695
02:44:58,940 --> 02:44:59,121
Yeah.

6696
02:44:59,121 --> 02:44:59,631
You want to hear it?

6697
02:44:59,631 --> 02:45:01,220
You want to hear the best making hookers?

6698
02:45:03,140 --> 02:45:04,940
He's going to snap back the other way.

6699
02:45:04,970 --> 02:45:06,290
This school's expensive as hell.

6700
02:45:06,291 --> 02:45:06,561
Right?

6701
02:45:06,561 --> 02:45:08,180
So one day I fucking
show up at the school.

6702
02:45:08,330 --> 02:45:09,650
They call us in and they're like,

6703
02:45:09,651 --> 02:45:09,801
yeah,

6704
02:45:09,801 --> 02:45:11,090
your son's having trouble reading.

6705
02:45:13,160 --> 02:45:13,993
Okay,

6706
02:45:14,300 --> 02:45:15,133
so what?

6707
02:45:15,920 --> 02:45:16,071
Yeah,

6708
02:45:16,071 --> 02:45:17,000
he's having trouble reading.

6709
02:45:17,001 --> 02:45:17,280
It's,

6710
02:45:17,280 --> 02:45:17,521
it's a,

6711
02:45:17,521 --> 02:45:18,354
it's a problem.

6712
02:45:19,400 --> 02:45:20,810
What the fuck am I paying you for?

6713
02:45:20,811 --> 02:45:22,730
Aren't you supposed to be
show saw this conversation.

6714
02:45:23,270 --> 02:45:24,620
They were out of that school that day.

6715
02:45:24,800 --> 02:45:25,660
So what was I saying?

6716
02:45:25,690 --> 02:45:26,790
What you need to teach him.

6717
02:45:26,900 --> 02:45:27,380
That was like,

6718
02:45:27,380 --> 02:45:32,380
like fucking one of these elitist
schools where you're either super fucking

6719
02:45:32,511 --> 02:45:37,460
smart and you pick up their curriculum
because they don't really teach what they

6720
02:45:37,461 --> 02:45:40,550
have a curriculum there that the kids
have to follow these kids and fucking

6721
02:45:40,551 --> 02:45:42,140
kindergarten get buried in homework.

6722
02:45:42,380 --> 02:45:44,090
It's one of these places
where you go there.

6723
02:45:44,510 --> 02:45:45,770
Every fucking mother,

6724
02:45:45,920 --> 02:45:48,970
their faces are fucking sewn
back to their ears and you know,

6725
02:45:49,550 --> 02:45:52,370
they put on fucking diamonds
the size of this egg to go,

6726
02:45:52,371 --> 02:45:52,820
you know,

6727
02:45:52,820 --> 02:45:55,970
they're all done up at fucking six in
the morning to take their kids to school

6728
02:45:55,971 --> 02:45:56,990
and I lasted,

6729
02:45:57,860 --> 02:45:59,660
I lasted a month at that freak show.

6730
02:46:00,200 --> 02:46:00,590
Wow.

6731
02:46:00,590 --> 02:46:00,960
Yeah.

6732
02:46:00,960 --> 02:46:01,370
I'm like,

6733
02:46:01,370 --> 02:46:02,870
what the fuck am I paying you for?

6734
02:46:02,871 --> 02:46:03,200
I might,

6735
02:46:03,200 --> 02:46:04,820
aren't I paying you to
teach them how to read?

6736
02:46:05,070 --> 02:46:07,410
You get very angry when
we renew reenacting this.

6737
02:46:07,520 --> 02:46:08,170
Yeah.

6738
02:46:08,170 --> 02:46:08,371
No,

6739
02:46:08,371 --> 02:46:08,471
it's,

6740
02:46:08,471 --> 02:46:08,750
it's,

6741
02:46:08,750 --> 02:46:09,660
that's a touchy subject.

6742
02:46:09,920 --> 02:46:10,010
I

6743
02:46:10,010 --> 02:46:10,580
see it.

6744
02:46:10,580 --> 02:46:11,081
It brings you,

6745
02:46:11,081 --> 02:46:11,914
right.

6746
02:46:12,860 --> 02:46:13,440
I have,

6747
02:46:13,440 --> 02:46:16,400
how do we get anywhere
on that tree school?

6748
02:46:17,300 --> 02:46:18,170
Elementary School.

6749
02:46:18,171 --> 02:46:18,411
Yeah.

6750
02:46:18,411 --> 02:46:19,071
That's what it is.

6751
02:46:19,071 --> 02:46:20,480
You training people for the Rhino,

6752
02:46:20,720 --> 02:46:22,370
but that's where you'd
put your kids at Dawson.

6753
02:46:22,730 --> 02:46:23,570
It's a school over there.

6754
02:46:23,630 --> 02:46:23,840
School.

6755
02:46:23,840 --> 02:46:24,240
Cool.

6756
02:46:24,240 --> 02:46:24,410
Yeah.

6757
02:46:24,410 --> 02:46:25,243
I love it.

6758
02:46:25,430 --> 02:46:26,740
I'm not going to Vegas and I'm moving.

6759
02:46:26,860 --> 02:46:27,600
I just say,

6760
02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:27,891
I said,

6761
02:46:27,891 --> 02:46:28,724
you're moving.

6762
02:46:29,810 --> 02:46:30,970
I'm trying to get back to the mountains.

6763
02:46:31,180 --> 02:46:31,810
I'm trying to go.

6764
02:46:31,810 --> 02:46:32,770
You go back to Colorado.

6765
02:46:32,771 --> 02:46:33,810
It's fucking crazy.

6766
02:46:33,820 --> 02:46:35,480
You find out what that's all about.

6767
02:46:35,481 --> 02:46:36,330
You got fucking loved it.

6768
02:46:36,500 --> 02:46:38,960
Saber Tooth Tigers in your
backyard and she'll me.

6769
02:46:40,060 --> 02:46:40,893
I'm fine.

6770
02:46:41,520 --> 02:46:42,590
It wasn't for Mrs Rogan.

6771
02:46:42,591 --> 02:46:43,670
I'd be back there right now.

6772
02:46:43,700 --> 02:46:45,350
Colorado is actually a cool place.

6773
02:46:45,351 --> 02:46:45,980
I like it too.

6774
02:46:45,980 --> 02:46:46,761
Well for me too.

6775
02:46:46,761 --> 02:46:50,840
It's also the dealing with
the giant crowds of people
at fcs and a comedy shows.

6776
02:46:51,110 --> 02:46:53,150
I like the contrast to being in the woods.

6777
02:46:53,150 --> 02:46:53,570
I liked,

6778
02:46:53,570 --> 02:46:54,950
I liked the contrast of the bolt.

6779
02:46:54,980 --> 02:46:55,491
I like it.

6780
02:46:55,491 --> 02:46:56,324
I think it's good for you,

6781
02:46:57,530 --> 02:46:57,730
man.

6782
02:46:57,730 --> 02:46:58,460
That's a great,

6783
02:46:58,460 --> 02:47:01,400
the only problem with Colorado is
you've got to have that winner.

6784
02:47:01,990 --> 02:47:02,950
Got To go through those winners,

6785
02:47:02,960 --> 02:47:03,111
man.

6786
02:47:03,111 --> 02:47:03,830
It ain't that bad.

6787
02:47:03,830 --> 02:47:05,360
Colorado when I was not that bad.

6788
02:47:05,361 --> 02:47:05,870
Crazy.

6789
02:47:05,870 --> 02:47:06,703
It's not that bad,

6790
02:47:07,250 --> 02:47:07,461
dude.

6791
02:47:07,461 --> 02:47:08,294
I'm telling you,

6792
02:47:08,390 --> 02:47:09,710
I'm too old for that shit

6793
02:47:11,420 --> 02:47:12,600
in Vegas and it's 40 out.

6794
02:47:12,610 --> 02:47:12,891
I'm like,

6795
02:47:12,891 --> 02:47:14,440
what the fuck is this shit?

6796
02:47:14,441 --> 02:47:16,460
I 40 well,

6797
02:47:16,461 --> 02:47:18,680
Vegas is 40 and cold
because there's no heart.

6798
02:47:18,910 --> 02:47:20,000
There's no hard to study.

6799
02:47:20,480 --> 02:47:21,500
Different kind of cold.

6800
02:47:21,501 --> 02:47:22,670
That's a fucking demonic.

6801
02:47:22,671 --> 02:47:23,930
Coal as funny.

6802
02:47:23,940 --> 02:47:25,200
It creeps into your marrow.

6803
02:47:25,780 --> 02:47:26,780
I like Vegas.

6804
02:47:26,781 --> 02:47:27,351
I'm just kidding.

6805
02:47:27,351 --> 02:47:28,850
I would like coming in
and getting out though.

6806
02:47:29,100 --> 02:47:29,720
But you know,

6807
02:47:29,720 --> 02:47:31,580
the problem is I'm always in town.

6808
02:47:31,870 --> 02:47:33,260
If I'm in there with Eddie Bravo,

6809
02:47:33,261 --> 02:47:34,100
we're always hammered,

6810
02:47:34,310 --> 02:47:34,730
you know?

6811
02:47:34,730 --> 02:47:35,000
Uh,

6812
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:36,740
if I'm there for the fights,

6813
02:47:36,770 --> 02:47:37,251
it's the place,

6814
02:47:37,251 --> 02:47:37,900
dude.

6815
02:47:37,900 --> 02:47:38,600
You know?

6816
02:47:38,600 --> 02:47:40,070
You know what I feel that way.

6817
02:47:40,130 --> 02:47:41,330
That's how La is for me.

6818
02:47:41,510 --> 02:47:42,050
Oh yeah.

6819
02:47:42,050 --> 02:47:42,861
We're not coming to la.

6820
02:47:42,861 --> 02:47:43,101
I'm like,

6821
02:47:43,101 --> 02:47:44,840
this place is the fucking devil.

6822
02:47:44,910 --> 02:47:46,970
And I live in Vegas for Christ's sake.

6823
02:47:47,530 --> 02:47:48,351
And I'm like,

6824
02:47:48,351 --> 02:47:50,360
get me the fuck is way with me kids.

6825
02:47:50,361 --> 02:47:51,320
He'd go out and drink.

6826
02:47:52,610 --> 02:47:55,430
So you're avoiding alcohol completely now.

6827
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:56,540
Wow.

6828
02:47:56,540 --> 02:47:58,520
So why don't you try a little
weed just a little bit.

6829
02:47:58,670 --> 02:48:00,170
I haven't drank in six weeks.

6830
02:48:00,230 --> 02:48:01,700
You can get medical marijuana,

6831
02:48:01,770 --> 02:48:03,110
medical from a doctor.

6832
02:48:04,220 --> 02:48:05,190
Never been into it.

6833
02:48:05,980 --> 02:48:07,570
Leighton's you right the fuck out.

6834
02:48:07,820 --> 02:48:09,160
Like yeah,

6835
02:48:09,560 --> 02:48:10,490
equilibrium,

6836
02:48:10,491 --> 02:48:11,181
all that shit.

6837
02:48:11,181 --> 02:48:12,020
Your Vertigo,

6838
02:48:12,160 --> 02:48:12,490
so,

6839
02:48:12,490 --> 02:48:13,700
so if it did that,

6840
02:48:13,730 --> 02:48:14,720
you'd have to be high.

6841
02:48:15,560 --> 02:48:16,140
Yes.

6842
02:48:16,140 --> 02:48:16,971
Yeah I can.

6843
02:48:16,971 --> 02:48:17,601
I can't do it.

6844
02:48:17,601 --> 02:48:18,200
No Fun.

6845
02:48:18,200 --> 02:48:18,591
Trust me.

6846
02:48:18,591 --> 02:48:19,160
He would love it.

6847
02:48:19,160 --> 02:48:19,993
It'd be fine.

6848
02:48:23,180 --> 02:48:23,931
Let's try it right now.

6849
02:48:23,931 --> 02:48:24,764
Too Old.

6850
02:48:24,780 --> 02:48:25,613
I'm too old.

6851
02:48:26,670 --> 02:48:27,830
There's no such thing.

6852
02:48:27,930 --> 02:48:28,241
Just,

6853
02:48:28,241 --> 02:48:28,581
you know,

6854
02:48:28,581 --> 02:48:31,190
just fucking take a week off
when you have a week off,

6855
02:48:31,191 --> 02:48:32,024
give it a shot.

6856
02:48:32,960 --> 02:48:34,130
Do you let me know.

6857
02:48:34,131 --> 02:48:35,300
Let me know when you're ready.

6858
02:48:35,510 --> 02:48:35,700
Just,

6859
02:48:35,700 --> 02:48:37,850
you know when you got to fucking
earache one day you're like,

6860
02:48:37,851 --> 02:48:38,480
listen,

6861
02:48:38,480 --> 02:48:39,770
I can't take this.

6862
02:48:40,460 --> 02:48:41,360
Take me somewhere.

6863
02:48:41,390 --> 02:48:42,390
I come at

6864
02:48:44,260 --> 02:48:44,570
like,

6865
02:48:44,570 --> 02:48:45,321
if you're going to do it,

6866
02:48:45,321 --> 02:48:46,510
just don't deal with anybody else.

6867
02:48:46,520 --> 02:48:47,121
Don't deal with the,

6868
02:48:47,121 --> 02:48:51,950
to this motherfucker will bring a gravity
bong puts you on on the first day.

6869
02:48:51,951 --> 02:48:53,150
He got to go slowly.

6870
02:48:53,420 --> 02:48:55,550
That's what I gotta do is get
the tooth high and then I can,

6871
02:48:56,030 --> 02:48:57,140
I'm telling you right now,

6872
02:48:58,100 --> 02:49:01,490
I'm late to every fucking
thing I do with this guy.

6873
02:49:01,520 --> 02:49:02,480
It's unbelievable.

6874
02:49:02,610 --> 02:49:03,960
It's like great guy.

6875
02:49:04,220 --> 02:49:05,330
He's like my other little kid.

6876
02:49:05,331 --> 02:49:05,731
But he said,

6877
02:49:05,731 --> 02:49:06,521
your personality,

6878
02:49:06,521 --> 02:49:07,670
it's fun to have you and it,

6879
02:49:07,690 --> 02:49:08,100
it's fun

6880
02:49:08,100 --> 02:49:09,210
to have her tell you what,

6881
02:49:09,450 --> 02:49:13,080
there's never a fucking day that you wake
up that the tooth in a bad mood tooth

6882
02:49:13,081 --> 02:49:14,100
ever has a bad day.

6883
02:49:14,550 --> 02:49:16,180
Never like fucking what's
the amount of tooth?

6884
02:49:16,190 --> 02:49:16,331
Well,

6885
02:49:16,331 --> 02:49:17,460
why are you upset to that today?

6886
02:49:17,470 --> 02:49:18,210
Just a fucking,

6887
02:49:18,210 --> 02:49:19,560
he's never ever man

6888
02:49:19,620 --> 02:49:21,000
listening to this and the podcasts going,

6889
02:49:21,090 --> 02:49:22,700
what is this guy talking about?

6890
02:49:22,770 --> 02:49:23,620
Who the fuck is the team?

6891
02:49:23,630 --> 02:49:24,463
Right?

6892
02:49:24,470 --> 02:49:25,303
This guy named Nick.

6893
02:49:25,470 --> 02:49:25,861
Good Dude.

6894
02:49:25,861 --> 02:49:27,480
We talk like we're talking about fucking,

6895
02:49:27,481 --> 02:49:27,781
you know,

6896
02:49:27,781 --> 02:49:28,770
Brad Pitt or something.

6897
02:49:28,771 --> 02:49:29,604
Exactly.

6898
02:49:29,790 --> 02:49:30,870
Everybody should know that too.

6899
02:49:30,900 --> 02:49:31,021
Well,

6900
02:49:31,021 --> 02:49:33,150
we got to wrap this thing up
because at three hours in,

6901
02:49:33,151 --> 02:49:34,140
we turn into a Pumpkin,

6902
02:49:34,290 --> 02:49:34,860
but uh,

6903
02:49:34,860 --> 02:49:35,640
we finally did it.

6904
02:49:35,640 --> 02:49:37,140
We finally had a pause for three hours.

6905
02:49:37,170 --> 02:49:37,770
Yeah.

6906
02:49:37,770 --> 02:49:38,160
Yeah.

6907
02:49:38,160 --> 02:49:38,700
Wow.

6908
02:49:38,700 --> 02:49:39,660
How long was I here?

6909
02:49:39,990 --> 02:49:42,020
Two plus two.

6910
02:49:44,850 --> 02:49:45,690
That's my skill.

6911
02:49:45,691 --> 02:49:49,260
Dana White's my skill is I can get people
to talk for long periods of time to be

6912
02:49:49,261 --> 02:49:49,740
comfortable.

6913
02:49:49,740 --> 02:49:51,120
You are a talented motherfucker.

6914
02:49:51,121 --> 02:49:51,954
Joe Rogan.

6915
02:49:52,200 --> 02:49:53,820
I admit I'm not talented,

6916
02:49:53,821 --> 02:49:58,821
but I'm good at the things that I'm
good at talking and talking shit.

6917
02:49:59,131 --> 02:50:01,380
I'm a professional shit
talker because all this,

6918
02:50:01,440 --> 02:50:04,110
all this shit talking to
in between this and comedy.

6919
02:50:04,260 --> 02:50:06,810
That's what makes doing
commentary so easy.

6920
02:50:07,290 --> 02:50:08,160
So before we wrap,

6921
02:50:08,161 --> 02:50:10,020
did you hit all the things
that the fans wanted to hear?

6922
02:50:10,050 --> 02:50:10,411
What else?

6923
02:50:10,411 --> 02:50:11,460
What else did I want to know?

6924
02:50:11,520 --> 02:50:13,220
The fuck what they want
these crazy assholes.

6925
02:50:13,300 --> 02:50:16,680
They want to know during the
war you show cruel to the foods.

6926
02:50:16,681 --> 02:50:20,580
Why are you loyal to the things
cruel to the fans and live them.

6927
02:50:21,420 --> 02:50:22,253
Actually said that.

6928
02:50:22,320 --> 02:50:24,000
That was one of the
things that a guy tweeted.

6929
02:50:24,270 --> 02:50:24,421
He,

6930
02:50:24,421 --> 02:50:25,220
this is this,

6931
02:50:25,220 --> 02:50:26,240
what did I lie about?

6932
02:50:26,241 --> 02:50:30,740
Eye exam that breaches the liar.

6933
02:50:30,741 --> 02:50:34,220
I'm probably the most fucking
honest guy that could,

6934
02:50:34,221 --> 02:50:34,461
uh,

6935
02:50:34,461 --> 02:50:35,120
you know,

6936
02:50:35,120 --> 02:50:35,810
here's a queen.

6937
02:50:35,810 --> 02:50:38,390
I can't tell you guys
everything all the fucking time.

6938
02:50:38,510 --> 02:50:41,120
I know you love to like talk
shit to people on Twitter.

6939
02:50:41,121 --> 02:50:45,110
So find this guy's name is
Sonny said Jeezy you could fly.

6940
02:50:45,111 --> 02:50:46,100
I retweeted it.

6941
02:50:46,130 --> 02:50:47,210
It says as Dana,

6942
02:50:47,211 --> 02:50:51,550
how often he lives on purpose
to the media and the fans.

6943
02:50:52,090 --> 02:50:52,940
And that was his tweet.

6944
02:50:52,990 --> 02:50:54,590
I don't know all the things
you could possibly ask him.

6945
02:50:54,740 --> 02:50:56,630
So of course me being an idiot,

6946
02:50:56,660 --> 02:50:59,450
that's the one guy respond
all these other people,

6947
02:50:59,510 --> 02:50:59,841
they was,

6948
02:50:59,841 --> 02:51:04,070

about the future of MMA and I ignore it.

6949
02:51:04,170 --> 02:51:04,941
I say to this guy,

6950
02:51:04,941 --> 02:51:06,890

6976
02:51:32,891 --> 02:51:33,281
It looks like,

6977
02:51:33,281 --> 02:51:33,730
you know,

6978
02:51:33,730 --> 02:51:36,550
and he and his buddies
talking shit to me in his bio.

6979
02:51:36,551 --> 02:51:37,061
It says,

6980
02:51:37,061 --> 02:51:37,894
uh,

6981
02:51:37,930 --> 02:51:38,231
yeah,

6982
02:51:38,231 --> 02:51:41,350
I'm the guy that girls like to bring
home to their parents and you know,

6983
02:51:41,351 --> 02:51:43,330
I'm faithful and I'm
cute and I'm Christian.

6984
02:51:43,720 --> 02:51:46,070
Are you fucking seriously

6985
02:51:46,120 --> 02:51:48,400
that's when you wrote

6986
02:51:48,670 --> 02:51:48,911
dude,

6987
02:51:48,911 --> 02:51:49,920
I am going to smash you.

6988
02:51:49,930 --> 02:51:50,670
Yeah,

6989
02:51:50,670 --> 02:51:51,170
oof.

6990
02:51:51,170 --> 02:51:54,060
Nasty as gay shit written
to me by Christians.

6991
02:51:54,061 --> 02:51:55,530
But I suppose it could,

6992
02:51:55,620 --> 02:51:56,010
you know,

6993
02:51:56,010 --> 02:51:58,410
Christians like you
look down at the thing,

6994
02:51:58,411 --> 02:52:00,210
you know God love and Christian God.

6995
02:52:00,211 --> 02:52:01,470
God bless America.

6996
02:52:01,530 --> 02:52:04,830
God bless the USA and made
of you fucking Queer Homo.

6997
02:52:04,831 --> 02:52:05,940
Why you to go sub?

6998
02:52:05,941 --> 02:52:07,630
Karlyn was called it's deck,

6999
02:52:09,390 --> 02:52:11,600
some Dick Ball rider.

7000
02:52:12,610 --> 02:52:13,950
Thank you for Jesus.

7001
02:52:14,640 --> 02:52:15,030
Fuck,

7002
02:52:15,030 --> 02:52:15,930
make up your mind.

7003
02:52:15,931 --> 02:52:16,321
You're fucking,

7004
02:52:16,321 --> 02:52:16,751
he's like,

7005
02:52:16,751 --> 02:52:17,584
oh,

7006
02:52:18,150 --> 02:52:18,580
that's it.

7007
02:52:18,580 --> 02:52:20,080
A couple of years ago I asked you,

7008
02:52:20,081 --> 02:52:20,450
Joe,

7009
02:52:20,450 --> 02:52:22,720
I just saw a cyborg fight or
something like that and I was like,

7010
02:52:22,721 --> 02:52:23,050
what?

7011
02:52:23,050 --> 02:52:25,060
UFC ever get females in it?

7012
02:52:25,330 --> 02:52:26,163
And you were like,

7013
02:52:26,170 --> 02:52:28,210
Dana was never elected happen.

7014
02:52:29,110 --> 02:52:29,861
What made it change?

7015
02:52:29,861 --> 02:52:30,341
Because I,

7016
02:52:30,341 --> 02:52:30,610
I'm,

7017
02:52:30,610 --> 02:52:31,090
I'm,

7018
02:52:31,090 --> 02:52:32,440
I think it's the greatest idea ever.

7019
02:52:32,620 --> 02:52:33,311
Ronda Rousey,

7020
02:52:33,311 --> 02:52:34,144
Ronda Rousey,

7021
02:52:34,420 --> 02:52:35,051
when I met her,

7022
02:52:35,051 --> 02:52:36,010
I saw some more fights,

7023
02:52:36,011 --> 02:52:36,844
then I met her.

7024
02:52:36,880 --> 02:52:37,510
Um,

7025
02:52:37,510 --> 02:52:39,790
and then we sat down and
talked one day and I was like,

7026
02:52:39,791 --> 02:52:40,810
Jesus Christ,

7027
02:52:41,020 --> 02:52:44,380
she's a marketing goldmine
and she's fucking legit.

7028
02:52:44,440 --> 02:52:45,670
She's super legit.

7029
02:52:45,671 --> 02:52:46,630
She's hot as fuck.

7030
02:52:46,631 --> 02:52:47,464
And she's angry.

7031
02:52:47,530 --> 02:52:48,191
She's angry,

7032
02:52:48,191 --> 02:52:48,720
man.

7033
02:52:48,720 --> 02:52:49,820
She is angry.

7034
02:52:51,430 --> 02:52:52,990
She really is angry people.

7035
02:52:52,991 --> 02:52:53,760
So great.

7036
02:52:53,760 --> 02:52:56,050
When you meet her and you really
fucking hang out with her,

7037
02:52:56,051 --> 02:52:57,340
this girl is a fucking,

7038
02:52:57,640 --> 02:52:59,380
she she's and look at that car.

7039
02:52:59,381 --> 02:53:00,100
She's a finisher.

7040
02:53:00,100 --> 02:53:00,933
Look at that card.

7041
02:53:00,940 --> 02:53:02,710
Leo Machida versus Dan Henderson.

7042
02:53:02,711 --> 02:53:03,700
Great fucking fight.

7043
02:53:03,701 --> 02:53:04,301
Dan Henderson,

7044
02:53:04,301 --> 02:53:08,140
the only guy to ever hold two
weight classes consecutively,

7045
02:53:08,260 --> 02:53:11,020
the 183 and the 205 pound title,

7046
02:53:11,021 --> 02:53:14,140
the same fucking time and
pride taken on Leo Machida,

7047
02:53:14,190 --> 02:53:15,400
former light heavyweight champion,

7048
02:53:15,401 --> 02:53:19,030
one of the top two or three light
heavyweights on the planet earth without a

7049
02:53:19,031 --> 02:53:19,690
doubt.

7050
02:53:19,690 --> 02:53:22,180
And then you got Josh
neer versus court McGee.

7051
02:53:22,270 --> 02:53:23,830
So Courtney is going on in one 70.

7052
02:53:23,831 --> 02:53:24,640
Is that what that is?

7053
02:53:24,640 --> 02:53:25,660
Those are those there.

7054
02:53:25,730 --> 02:53:26,030
Uh,

7055
02:53:26,030 --> 02:53:27,070
I think that one is,

7056
02:53:27,071 --> 02:53:27,904
uh,

7057
02:53:28,150 --> 02:53:29,100
is that one on the main card?

7058
02:53:29,310 --> 02:53:30,960
That was the main card core.

7059
02:53:30,980 --> 02:53:32,020
Maggie's a great fucking fight.

7060
02:53:32,080 --> 02:53:32,171
Well,

7061
02:53:32,171 --> 02:53:35,110
that one's not the effects one is
the main event for the prelims.

7062
02:53:35,440 --> 02:53:37,030
The courts running shop.

7063
02:53:37,060 --> 02:53:37,301
Oh,

7064
02:53:37,301 --> 02:53:38,081
Lavar Johnson.

7065
02:53:38,081 --> 02:53:38,261
Yeah.

7066
02:53:38,261 --> 02:53:38,860
Fx.

7067
02:53:38,860 --> 02:53:40,900
So court McGee has dropped down to one 70.

7068
02:53:40,930 --> 02:53:41,763
Is that what that is?

7069
02:53:41,890 --> 02:53:42,550
It must be.

7070
02:53:42,550 --> 02:53:43,030
I mean,

7071
02:53:43,030 --> 02:53:44,710
Josh neer isn't going up to one 85.

7072
02:53:44,711 --> 02:53:45,340
Right.

7073
02:53:45,340 --> 02:53:45,820
All right.

7074
02:53:45,820 --> 02:53:46,151
Right.

7075
02:53:46,151 --> 02:53:46,541
Is that right?

7076
02:53:46,541 --> 02:53:47,374
Am I right?

7077
02:53:47,470 --> 02:53:47,970
Am I right?

7078
02:53:47,970 --> 02:53:48,700
I pics in here.

7079
02:53:48,700 --> 02:53:51,540
It's a big fucking kid to get huge.

7080
02:53:52,570 --> 02:53:54,280
His endurance is staggering.

7081
02:53:54,310 --> 02:53:55,750
That guy has got incredible endurance.

7082
02:53:55,751 --> 02:53:55,940
You know,

7083
02:53:55,940 --> 02:53:57,520
you've runs like,

7084
02:53:57,521 --> 02:54:00,310
like five minute miles with
a fucking weight vest on.

7085
02:54:00,311 --> 02:54:01,360
That kid's an animal.

7086
02:54:01,480 --> 02:54:02,250
That's a fun fight.

7087
02:54:02,250 --> 02:54:03,071
It's a great fight.

7088
02:54:03,071 --> 02:54:06,430
And then so is Josh Koscheck Robbie Lawler

7089
02:54:08,190 --> 02:54:09,160
excited for that fight?

7090
02:54:09,250 --> 02:54:11,470
That fight is going to be fucking crazy.

7091
02:54:11,560 --> 02:54:12,790
What else is on this card?

7092
02:54:13,840 --> 02:54:14,130
Oh,

7093
02:54:14,130 --> 02:54:14,621
we gotta go.

7094
02:54:14,621 --> 02:54:15,454
We gotta wrap.

7095
02:54:15,900 --> 02:54:19,120
[inaudible] favorite that's
flying under the radar.

7096
02:54:19,150 --> 02:54:19,420
Yeah.

7097
02:54:19,420 --> 02:54:20,860
That's a great fucking fight.

7098
02:54:20,861 --> 02:54:25,861
Men Javan fader or filtrate or
tomorrow and tomorrow be mile.

7099
02:54:26,750 --> 02:54:30,220
I haven't men Jabar fought GSP the
first fight of his fucking career.

7100
02:54:30,280 --> 02:54:31,720
He weighs 135 pounds.

7101
02:54:31,750 --> 02:54:32,290
Okay.

7102
02:54:32,290 --> 02:54:32,471
I mean,

7103
02:54:32,471 --> 02:54:33,610
he would fight favor.

7104
02:54:33,710 --> 02:54:34,210
All right.

7105
02:54:34,210 --> 02:54:36,340
He wouldn't fight fate or if
you thought you looked up,

7106
02:54:36,341 --> 02:54:37,550
I haven't mentioned barn fader.

7107
02:54:37,840 --> 02:54:38,673
He would fight him.

7108
02:54:39,040 --> 02:54:39,580
That's a,

7109
02:54:39,580 --> 02:54:39,911
there's a,

7110
02:54:39,911 --> 02:54:41,050
this is a great card man.

7111
02:54:41,051 --> 02:54:41,831
I'm fucking pumped.

7112
02:54:41,831 --> 02:54:42,760
And that's this weekend,

7113
02:54:43,770 --> 02:54:44,940
7:00 PM Eastern,

7114
02:54:44,941 --> 02:54:45,774
10:00 PM

7115
02:54:45,930 --> 02:54:46,510
sorry.

7116
02:54:46,510 --> 02:54:47,530
In Anaheim.

7117
02:54:47,680 --> 02:54:48,700
If you're in la,

7118
02:54:48,790 --> 02:54:50,110
are there any tickets available?

7119
02:54:50,440 --> 02:54:50,780
Yeah.

7120
02:54:50,780 --> 02:54:50,900
Yeah,

7121
02:54:50,900 --> 02:54:51,640
they're still ticking.

7122
02:54:51,640 --> 02:54:53,590
The great part is it's
all the cheap seats,

7123
02:54:53,591 --> 02:54:54,424
man.

7124
02:54:54,430 --> 02:54:55,121
There's like a,

7125
02:54:55,121 --> 02:54:56,410
there's a few hundred cheap tickets.

7126
02:54:56,411 --> 02:54:57,520
It's the cheapest tier.

7127
02:54:57,580 --> 02:54:58,480
Usually when,

7128
02:54:58,650 --> 02:54:59,201
when you,

7129
02:54:59,201 --> 02:54:59,861
when you don't sell,

7130
02:54:59,861 --> 02:55:01,960
it's usually that middle
tier that doesn't sell.

7131
02:55:01,961 --> 02:55:02,920
These are the cheapest tickets.

7132
02:55:03,470 --> 02:55:04,460
This thing is going to be a sellout.

7133
02:55:04,940 --> 02:55:05,181
Well,

7134
02:55:05,181 --> 02:55:06,290
it's a great card too.

7135
02:55:06,291 --> 02:55:07,220
On top of that,

7136
02:55:07,221 --> 02:55:07,700
there's a,

7137
02:55:07,700 --> 02:55:12,290
the FX fights as a Brendan
Shab versus Lavar Johnson.

7138
02:55:12,291 --> 02:55:14,660
That's a crazy fucking heavyweight fight.

7139
02:55:14,661 --> 02:55:16,040
That's going to be a great fight.

7140
02:55:16,490 --> 02:55:17,630
I can't wait to see that.

7141
02:55:17,631 --> 02:55:18,530
Holy Shit.

7142
02:55:19,010 --> 02:55:19,591
And uh,

7143
02:55:19,591 --> 02:55:20,181
that's the,

7144
02:55:20,181 --> 02:55:21,500
so the prelims,

7145
02:55:21,501 --> 02:55:22,610
they started on Facebook,

7146
02:55:22,611 --> 02:55:23,570
then they're on Fx.

7147
02:55:23,571 --> 02:55:26,810
And then of course the
main card is on paper view.

7148
02:55:26,811 --> 02:55:29,240
Robbie Lawler versus Josh Koscheck,

7149
02:55:29,241 --> 02:55:30,410
a crazy fucking fight.

7150
02:55:30,500 --> 02:55:32,480
Court McGee versus Josh neer.

7151
02:55:32,481 --> 02:55:33,111
That's a great,

7152
02:55:33,111 --> 02:55:34,550
Josh neer is one of my favorite guys.

7153
02:55:34,550 --> 02:55:35,720
I like watching that kid fight.

7154
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:37,250
Never in a is awesome.

7155
02:55:37,280 --> 02:55:38,390
He's gritty is fun.

7156
02:55:38,580 --> 02:55:39,030
The kids,

7157
02:55:39,030 --> 02:55:40,310
he's a savage man.

7158
02:55:40,311 --> 02:55:42,860
Jabbar and favor is going to be fantastic.

7159
02:55:43,040 --> 02:55:46,280
Then of course Henderson and
Machida is a fucking amazing fight.

7160
02:55:46,281 --> 02:55:49,010
I can't wait to see that fight and
I can't wait to see Ronnie route.

7161
02:55:49,040 --> 02:55:50,330
Ronda Rousey and Carmouche.

7162
02:55:50,900 --> 02:55:52,640
Liz Carmouche is a Badass bitch too.

7163
02:55:52,641 --> 02:55:53,970
She's really tough kids.

7164
02:55:54,310 --> 02:55:55,200
They're both tough.

7165
02:55:55,340 --> 02:55:56,480
That's going to be fantastic.

7166
02:55:56,570 --> 02:55:57,530
[inaudible] man.

7167
02:55:57,531 --> 02:55:59,030
She throws crazy on Orthodox.

7168
02:55:59,031 --> 02:56:00,260
Shit's been an elbows,

7169
02:56:00,560 --> 02:56:00,980
uh,

7170
02:56:00,980 --> 02:56:04,460
flying knees and her ground and pound
is nasty and she knows is a huge

7171
02:56:04,461 --> 02:56:04,971
opportunity.

7172
02:56:04,971 --> 02:56:05,990
She's going to go for broke.

7173
02:56:06,440 --> 02:56:07,550
It's going to be chaos.

7174
02:56:07,790 --> 02:56:08,450
Dana White.

7175
02:56:08,450 --> 02:56:09,283
