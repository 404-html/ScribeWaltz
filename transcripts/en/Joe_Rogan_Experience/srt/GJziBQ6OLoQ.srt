1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,650
Four,
three,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,780
two,
one.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Okay,
so I'm on my way over here and I'm 

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,641
listening to this new radio lab podcast 
and then talking about this new 

5
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:14,190
technology that's available.
I'm like,

6
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:19,191
this is the perfect thing to be 
listening to right when I'm coming to 

7
00:00:19,191 --> 00:00:19,191
hang out with Eddie Bravo.
Oh No.

8
00:00:19,191 --> 00:00:21,570
There's a website called future of fake 
news.com

9
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:23,670
where they show this new technology on 
display.

10
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,760
Well you know how adobe does photoshop 
and so they can.

11
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,850
They can adjust images.
They can take 20 to 40 minutes to.

12
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,970
They could do it with 20.
They prefer to do it with 40,

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,760
40 minutes of recorded audio of you 
talking.

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,120
Then they run it through this machine 
and they can have you say words you've 

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,900
never said thinking of you make sounds 
that you've never made in those.

16
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,160
In those little sentences.
That's so like you could have a sentence

17
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:47,370
that.

18
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,430
Yeah,
like you can have a sentence that says 

19
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:52,430
like a,
hey joe,

20
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,470
you want to get something to eat after 
the podcast and they can intersect.

21
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:58,500
Hey Joe,
I got a bunch of transgender hookers and

22
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:03,501
some heroin.
You want to get something to eat and go 

23
00:01:03,501 --> 00:01:05,670
hang out with them after the podcast,
and it would sound exactly like what you

24
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:10,671
said.
It looks sound exactly like your own 

25
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:10,671
word,
but I'm sure there's going to be experts

26
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:11,910
that can analyze it and go,
this is,

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,080
this is a fraud for now.
What they're essentially saying is this 

28
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,080
is,
uh,

29
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,941
the infancy of it.
You have to get like experts to analyze 

30
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:20,941
the audio.
You could see it right there.

31
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:25,060
They'd synthesized Barack Obama's a 
audio and they have them say things that

32
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,260
he never said the,
they have him and George Bush going back

33
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:30,630
and forth telling jokes to each other 
that they never told.

34
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,050
Dude,
I.

35
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,330
can we hear this?
Yeah,

36
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,160
yeah,
yeah.

37
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,900
So now can we think you're talking about
find that.

38
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,460
Okay.
See if you can find that.

39
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:40,010
It might be on their website.
Um,

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,050
it doesn't sound good when they're doing
that,

41
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,560
but it's in its infancy,
but it sounds like them talking,

42
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,780
it just,
it sounds a little edited,

43
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,490
you know,
it's not flowing together.

44
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:55,491
Right.
But apparently they're able to break 

45
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:57,681
down faces to the point where say there 
were saying that like if Jennifer 

46
00:01:57,681 --> 00:01:59,760
Aniston goes to China and she does a 
commercial for something,

47
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:05,660
what they can do is have Jennifer 
Aniston talk for a period of time and 

48
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,341
they figured out how her,
her voice moves and they take all these 

49
00:02:10,341 --> 00:02:13,701
images of her face and they can 
manipulate it so accurately they can 

50
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:15,150
have someone speaking mandarin Chinese 
where all the different,

51
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:20,151
you know,
different sounds they make and they 

52
00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:21,921
could sync up her lips and her movement 
and the movement of her face to what it 

53
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:24,030
would look like if she was making those 
actual sounds,

54
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,690
which is just amazing.
So then they can have a voice like a 

55
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,421
mandarin speaking woman who could speak 
in Chinese and you would see the exact 

56
00:02:32,421 --> 00:02:34,890
correct movements from Jennifer 
Aniston's mouth.

57
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:40,070
So it wouldn't like,
you know how you watch like a movie 

58
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,070
though,
right?

59
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,000
But let's hear,
let's hear it.

60
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,550
Our parties have moved further and 
further apart and it's harder and harder

61
00:02:50,111 --> 00:02:55,111
to find common ground.
So what I said in 2004 that there were 

62
00:02:56,021 --> 00:02:59,080
no red states,
blue states through the United States of

63
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,040
America was

64
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,040
wrong.
So you could tell by the lips in that 

65
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,040
one.
Yeah.

66
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,070
Have you looked at his lips?
It looked fun,

67
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:11,770
but that's just now like what's it going
to be like in a year?

68
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:13,630
What's it going to be like in five 
years?

69
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,660
And this is.
This is what they're saying is that 

70
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,360
we're,
we're looking at now is the future of 

71
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,561
fake news.
They're going to be able to recreate 

72
00:03:22,561 --> 00:03:24,280
people saying things that they never 
said and it's going to be impossible for

73
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:29,281
you to tell the difference.
So how can that be used for the 

74
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:30,550
Illuminati?
How could it be used for anybody?

75
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:33,610
That's the problem.
Anybody can see the problem is that good

76
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,040
enough DC,
oh now we can do this.

77
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,000
I don't know.
It's hard.

78
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:42,001
It's hard to say what would be good 
because you never know what the end 

79
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:42,001
result of anything is going to be.

80
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:46,200
When someone creates some sort of a mind
bending world changing technology like 

81
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:51,271
that.
It only could be for bad because it's a 

82
00:03:51,271 --> 00:03:51,271
lie.
It's not going to be alive.

83
00:03:51,271 --> 00:03:55,210
Whatever it comes out of their mouth,
it's going to be a lie so that there's 

84
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:55,210
no way that could be good.
Yeah,

85
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:59,830
but see what it is is the consequences 
of technologists pushing boundaries.

86
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:05,070
So the problem is it's not.
Their intention is not initially to do 

87
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:09,481
something bad.
That's one of the interesting things 

88
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:09,481
about the radio lab.
Probably funny.

89
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:13,140
Hold on because the radio lab podcast 
talk to the technologists and they 

90
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,861
confronted her with it and it's very 
uncomfortable to watch this lady be 

91
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:18,700
confronted with the idea like what if 
this is used for evil?

92
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:21,850
Like what if it's used for fake news and
you could tell that they don't.

93
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,650
They're not even thinking about that.

94
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,650
Hardly all they're trying to do is 
figure out how to do something that 

95
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,891
nobody else can do.
Like when someone comes up with the 

96
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:34,441
technology,
if you can come up with some sort of a 

97
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,150
voice manipulating technology like that 
or a visual manipulating technology,

98
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,320
you've got to realize there's a bunch of
other people that are probably closing 

99
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,371
in on something like that too,
and it becomes this mad race to get 

100
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:45,280
something done and to make a shit ton of
money.

101
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,620
If you have something like that that 
could be potentially worth who knows 

102
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,240
ungodly sums of money.
I'm just trying to figure out a way you 

103
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,781
could use that for good to go away.
The one thing that they were saying is 

104
00:04:57,781 --> 00:05:01,920
you could take recordings of Einstein.
There's hours and hours and hours and 

105
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,660
hours of recordings of Einstein.
You could create a visual Einstein and 

106
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,891
you could have a three d technology 
perhaps or virtual reality technology 

107
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:14,761
where you're hanging out having a 
fucking conversation with Einstein and 

108
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,300
now step one.

109
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:24,330
Right?
Step two is some sort of a neural 

110
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,191
interface with virtual reality where 
instead of just looking at it through 

111
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:29,731
goggles,
it's going into your mind in some sort 

112
00:05:29,731 --> 00:05:33,601
of a way.
It's interfacing with the very neurons 

113
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:33,601
and the very,
your visual cortex.

114
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,410
It's showing you images that you're,
you know,

115
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,520
you wouldn't really be seeing for sure.
It would be great for brainwashing 

116
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:41,520
though.
Yeah.

117
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:41,520
Oh,
for sure.

118
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,970
That's a no brainer.
That's for sure.

119
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,310
Because we're brainwashed,
but they like fake news.

120
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,130
Just like you said,
the thing is perfect.

121
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,320
No one gets out alive with this shit.
So this is the thing.

122
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,220
There's one thing that might be 
fascinating about it is there's gonna be

123
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:59,221
no control,
like everyone's going to be able to 

124
00:05:59,221 --> 00:06:02,561
eventually use something like this and 
they said that it would require like 

125
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:05,620
painstaking step by step a person going 
over the data to see if they could 

126
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:11,720
figure out what was manipulated and they
think they could find like 75 percent of

127
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:15,020
the ones that have been manipulated 
right now find the fake ones.

128
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,490
But the problem is the amount of time 
that it takes to do that is astounding.

129
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,430
Crazy.
It's an.

130
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,010
It's people to people time like you 
have.

131
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,170
You have to be sitting there like going 
over it,

132
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:25,580
looking at what is this?
Check that out,

133
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,260
go back.
What's this number right here?

134
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,880
Why is this off?
What's going on here?

135
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:33,881
Okay,
mark that move on and they have to like 

136
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:33,881
do this over and over and over again.
They'll lifts her anomalies.

137
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:38,411
Look for some sort of evidence that has 
been manipulated by a digital source or 

138
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:43,001
by some sort of a digital control,
a phone or a computer or something like 

139
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:47,141
that.
I think it'll be easy to tell from the 

140
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:47,141
beginning.
Maybe.

141
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:47,740
What do you mean?
How good are photoshops?

142
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,920
Like the Photoshop,
Steve,

143
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,740
how good are some of his photoshops and 
this dude is just having fun.

144
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,310
Well,
how about that?

145
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:57,320
Photoshop of A.
I think it's Neil Armstrong where he's 

146
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,150
standing on the moon and if like there's
a shot,

147
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,720
there's a shot of him looking down.
It's like a selfie and then there's the 

148
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,340
earth in the background and they proved 
that's a photo,

149
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:12,370
a photo shop already.
I mean they could just run it through 

150
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:12,370
shit.
Just basic shit.

151
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,561
And you could see that it was cut in.
Well there was definitely some 

152
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:15,730
manipulation of photos for press use 
this.

153
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,160
Not just that was.
That was 1969.

154
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:21,110
Well,
they did it before that even they did it

155
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:24,080
with the Gemini Space Program when we 
did a defending that picture.

156
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:24,430
No,
it's good.

157
00:07:24,431 --> 00:07:24,950
No,
it's real.

158
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,770
Nobody defends that picture.
Well,

159
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,780
I don't know if they do or don't,
but the craziest one is Michael Collins 

160
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:31,780
because Michael Collins,
you can prove it.

161
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,370
The Gemini 15 picture,
they took a test photo of him like in 

162
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,720
some sort of a warehouse where they 
would strap him up with a harness and 

163
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,500
they're showing them how to utilize this
equipment and then they blocked all that

164
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:45,710
shit out and reverse the image and try 
to pretend he was doing a spacewalk.

165
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,630
Never seen it.
Uh,

166
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,720
and maybe maybe.
I mean I've seen so much on the moon.

167
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,330
This one's the best one.
Not Even the moon.

168
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,910
It's just Michael Collins.
But you should see it because it's like,

169
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:57,620
wait a minute,
why the fuck would they do that?

170
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,970
Like they took a photo.
This is a 100 percent.

171
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:07,330
This is not speculation.
They took a photo of him at a test 

172
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,430
facility where they would prepare 
themselves for walking on the moon.

173
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,160
The one on the left is then preparing.
See,

174
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:18,340
you could tell he's in a harness,
there's a bunch of equipment around and 

175
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,750
he's hanging onto this thing and they're
pulling them like with this harness that

176
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:25,751
he's attached to.
And then the next one it says it's a 

177
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:26,720
spacewalk.
It's the same exact image.

178
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:30,620
They just blacked it out.
They just took all the stuff that was in

179
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:35,621
the background,
all the equipment and all the bullshit 

180
00:08:35,621 --> 00:08:35,720
that's kind of a blurry copy.
See you can find a better copy of it.

181
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:40,870
But what they did was they made a fake 
photo of a guy in space that photo's not

182
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:46,001
real.
That's a photo of him in the test suit 

183
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:47,720
and they just reversed it and blacked 
out the background.

184
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,610
They could get away with stuff like that
back then,

185
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:50,780
man.
It wasn't,

186
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,780
that's a better picture of it.
There you got to get a,

187
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,110
that's a good,
uh,

188
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,980
representation.
It's

189
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,530
just what,
what they did was take all that shit.

190
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,900
What they did was unquestionably 
deceptive.

191
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,700
So the question is how much of that did 
they do?

192
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,420
Oh,
come on.

193
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,650
Well,
that's the question.

194
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,680
The question is,
it's even hard for the most hardcore of 

195
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:13,740
skeptics,
not even the most hardcore skeptics.

196
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:15,240
They're like,
yeah,

197
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:17,970
I'm on the fence about that moon thing.
You know,

198
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:19,620
I'm.
No one's really.

199
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,990
No one's really saying yes.
He went to the moon.

200
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:24,990
Now even like Mick Westville shut up 
about that.

201
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,070
You know,
there's Niki.

202
00:09:26,071 --> 00:09:27,690
We'll.
I don't think you're right at all.

203
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:29,420
I think he would definitely argue that 
we went to the moon.

204
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,720
Well,
he's getting paid for that.

205
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:33,720
So they come in and he's got to.
I mean the dude,

206
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,300
the dude backs up every official story.
Yeah,

207
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:41,301
but people do that.
Not necessarily because they're getting 

208
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:43,671
paid.
They do it because that's the mindset 

209
00:09:43,671 --> 00:09:43,671
they're in.

210
00:09:43,671 --> 00:09:46,100
They're in this mindset like we were 
talking about someone else before the 

211
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:46,100
podcast website.
He makes money on his website.

212
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,780
That's what I'm talking very little 
money to be made of bumping things.

213
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:53,970
That's not the motivation for doing it 
when you're a multimillionaire from 

214
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:53,970
video games.
I mean,

215
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,910
he made a shit ton of money from,
from selling video games.

216
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:02,210
He was like a some sort of a programmer 
in video games and then he has a good 

217
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:07,101
time debunking things,
but he has an official story 

218
00:10:07,101 --> 00:10:07,101
mentalities,
what I would call it,

219
00:10:07,101 --> 00:10:11,720
where no matter what,
like there's people that are objective 

220
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,380
and there's people that are debunkers 
and he's a debunker and it doesn't 

221
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,920
necessarily mean he's wrong about a lot 
of stuff,

222
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:21,921
but it does mean that he goes into 
things with the intention to debunk and 

223
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,820
the intention to almost always gravitate
towards an official stores.

224
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,600
Every single t he blended.
He believes Harvey Oswald acted alone.

225
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,680
Yeah.
That's a goof.

226
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:32,280
Come on,
man.

227
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,400
That one's goofy.
He believes tower seven collapsed at 

228
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:37,950
free.
Fall speed because the fires.

229
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,810
There's a lot of people that believe 
that.

230
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,700
Unfortunately I'm not a fucking 
engineer.

231
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:46,701
I would like to know whether or not it's
possible to burn a building so bad 

232
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:47,910
inside that it does collapse like that.
It's impossible.

233
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,200
I don't know if that's true.
None of it.

234
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,190
All you have to do is talk to engineers 
and architects.

235
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:54,230
I've talked to them.
You could.

236
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,960
You could.
You could hear them.

237
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,440
No,
there's no architects that it outside of

238
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:06,441
Nist,
a government agents and there's no 

239
00:11:06,441 --> 00:11:06,441
architects fighting for,
uh,

240
00:11:06,441 --> 00:11:11,380
I'm trying to debunk the tower seven.
There's none in every account.

241
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:14,850
I don't know if that's true to you.
I don't know if you know that,

242
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,590
but there's got to be some architects 
and engineers that don't think that that

243
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,420
building fell because it was demolished.

244
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,140
No.
Well,

245
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,970
if you understand how it,
there's about 100,000

246
00:11:26,971 --> 00:11:31,971
architects and engineers and the 
associations like the American 

247
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:36,350
Association of Architects in here.
There's about a hundred thousand and 

248
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,520
Richard Gauge.
He's one of them and he didn't know 

249
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:40,520
anything about.
He thought it was a,

250
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:45,411
it wasn't an inside job.
It took him years and then he didn't 

251
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:48,621
really know about tower seven.
Most of them don't know about power 

252
00:11:48,621 --> 00:11:48,621
seven.
What he does now,

253
00:11:48,621 --> 00:11:53,090
he discovered it and what he does now,
we'll just go from convention to 

254
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:56,050
convention,
sitting 15 architects down at a time and

255
00:11:56,051 --> 00:11:58,000
boom,
about 99 percent of them.

256
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:03,330
They all believe that.
They didn't even know there was a third 

257
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:03,330
tower.
It was not in the media that much.

258
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,230
They basically ignored.
It's crazy.

259
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:08,500
I think by this time everybody knows 
about tower so they still don't know.

260
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,380
Most people don't know,
but they don't.

261
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,610
You don't run on a mainstream media.

262
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:17,730
How could anybody.
People have talked about it enough 

263
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:18,880
online to the point now more than ever,
but still my now more than ever,

264
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:23,881
yes.
They go to hear about that tower seven 

265
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:23,881
thing,
but they don't really know the details.

266
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:23,881
They just kind of just know about it.
You know?

267
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,560
You ever see the video that shows the 
full collapse,

268
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,500
which takes a lot longer.
She the first collapsed.

269
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:34,770
It was the top of the thing falls into 
the center and that's the elevations 

270
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,300
they explain architects and engineers.
I've sat with them.

271
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:42,330
I'm a structural engineer,
but you tell them this is what if 

272
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:46,381
someone told you,
if someone told you there's 85 columns 

273
00:12:46,381 --> 00:12:50,551
that hold up tower shoving and if 
someone told you about structional 

274
00:12:50,551 --> 00:12:50,740
engineer,
told you,

275
00:12:50,741 --> 00:12:52,960
would you think he was crazy or would 
you believe him?

276
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:55,180
If he said,
and it makes sense.

277
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:56,020
I mean it's common sense.

278
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,370
The only way you're going to get a 
building to come down like that,

279
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,840
any building,
any structure,

280
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,290
is you have to blow up all 80 comps the 
same time.

281
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,480
Otherwise they won't go down like that.
To me,

282
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,900
that's common sense to someone who 
believes that government agencies have 

283
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:12,900
said,
no,

284
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,640
that's not true.
One column went and then it spiraled out

285
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:19,090
of control because of fires.
When you talk to structural engineers,

286
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:24,270
I've had,
I've had Richard Gauge on my podcast 

287
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:24,270
wife.
Every time it comes back,

288
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,590
he gets more.
He just piles on more because all I 

289
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:28,590
gotta do is sit them down.
They don't know.

290
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,440
Nobody knows.
That's the truth.

291
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,790
CSE ever debated someone who's like an 
opposing viewpoint,

292
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,510
but it will debate on structural.
I know nobody's backing up.

293
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,320
This is what he's teaching them would 
though,

294
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,660
because when they look into it,
it's common sense.

295
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,760
Anybody knows you got to,
so you think that they know that it's 

296
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,771
not true.
They think they think that power tower 

297
00:13:49,771 --> 00:13:49,771
seven was an inside job and they don't 
want to debate it because they can't.

298
00:13:49,771 --> 00:13:52,060
When you really think they think that.
I say that again,

299
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,860
so you think that people that are 
debunking it,

300
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,140
so like if,
if he's got this opinion,

301
00:13:56,141 --> 00:14:00,130
there's no architects and engineers 
debunk it had already looked into that.

302
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,620
That's already been,
that's already been done.

303
00:14:02,621 --> 00:14:06,670
And set texts and engineers just 
disagree.

304
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,720
Come on man.
You don't think there's any people to 

305
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:12,720
find the video?
Find a video of a real.

306
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,520
I mean it's got a government agency,
Jamie,

307
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,900
see if you can that,
but doesn't that make sense?

308
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:20,620
What is sort of a,
an engineer told you,

309
00:14:20,621 --> 00:14:23,230
uh,
struck a dude who build skyscrapers told

310
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,210
you to your face?
Like I've been told to my face.

311
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:30,420
They said the only way that,
and you see it on video engineer after 

312
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:30,420
engineer,
after engineer.

313
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,140
Are they all crazy?
The engineer,

314
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,230
engineer after Ingenico?
It's impossible when you look into it,

315
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:40,060
it's impossible for a building to 
collapse like that unless all 80 columns

316
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,700
are blown up at the same time we,
we've covered this,

317
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:43,550
but here's,
it's common.

318
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:48,650
I don't know anything about engineering.
I don't know if you have diesel fires to

319
00:14:48,651 --> 00:14:50,950
get out of control.
If it weakens the entire.

320
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,190
Where it just collapses

321
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,670
like that,
I don't know if you have,

322
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:59,940
you have guests all the time that are 
experts in fields that you're not 

323
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,311
experts in,
but when you sit here just find out 

324
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:03,311
sometimes they're wrong.
Unfortunately.

325
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:07,870
Sometimes they would ramble about some 
stuff and then they find out that 

326
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,090
they're making some of it up or this is 
some of it does happen,

327
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,670
but as an engineer,
a guy who builds,

328
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,010
understand this,
doesn't it make sense?

329
00:15:16,011 --> 00:15:17,090
Jamie?
Does that make sense?

330
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:22,150
Google,
like try to figure out like who resists 

331
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,320
architects and engineers?
Like what is it written down?

332
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:27,350
I'm reading right now an article from 
the Boston Globe that talks about truth 

333
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,940
is nine slash 11 and Richard Gauges 
talked about and I think they they're 

334
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,630
going to hold on that might have 
interviewed him in and I'm trying to 

335
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:34,630
figure out what this is,
what they're talking about.

336
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,960
There's got to be some artists that have
had a conversation or a debate with 

337
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,980
someone who believes in you couldn't 
possibly have fallen any other way.

338
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,800
Maybe they're out there.
Here's the thing.

339
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:50,801
I don't know,
Shit like I don't know how my fucking 

340
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:50,801
computer works.
I don't know.

341
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:50,801
How do you know anything that 
constructs.

342
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:52,140
How do you know anything?
A lot of Shit,

343
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,660
you know a lot,
but I know,

344
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,650
but if somebody wanted to argue with me 
about the components and how they worked

345
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,870
on a laptop,
I would have to let go.

346
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,880
Yes,
you're probably right after to talk to 

347
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,240
some computer engineer who's going to 
tell me the actual reality of it.

348
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,240
Build buildings.
I've had a mom I'm sure,

349
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:13,241
but I just can't believe that the people
that build buildings think it's an 

350
00:16:13,241 --> 00:16:13,250
inside job,
so.

351
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:15,090
Okay.
What if we said,

352
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:20,140
okay,
what have been pretty impressive if 90 

353
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:20,140
percent.
That was pretty impressive.

354
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,550
It was a 50 percent would be impressive.
Exactly.

355
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,160
Fifty percent would be impressed.
It's about in the nineties.

356
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:30,190
I don't know if that's right.
So I don't know where you getting that 

357
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:30,190
number.
I'm getting it from Richard Gage,

358
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,500
who's the head of architects and 
engineers was not 11 truth.

359
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,640
They add another couple of understand 
but know.

360
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,290
But he might be a little biased,
right?

361
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:44,291
I mean,
if he's the head of architects and 

362
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,791
engineers from nine,
11 truth and he tells you that 90 

363
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:46,100
percent of the architects and engineers 
out there think it's an inside job,

364
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:51,430
it might be a little biased.
I don't know if that's true and I don't 

365
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:51,430
think you do necessarily either.
I think we're.

366
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,520
We're just guessing.
I believe it.

367
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,560
I would love to see.
I would love to see an architect or an 

368
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,081
engineer that disagreed with him,
talked to him about it and go over the 

369
00:17:02,081 --> 00:17:05,171
data because until that happens,
I don't know what the fuck they're 

370
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:05,171
talking about.

371
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:05,870
No,
nobody argues with them.

372
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,910
Nobody does.
That's got to be.

373
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:09,860
There's got to be someone who debunks 
that guy.

374
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:14,861
Everybody debunks.
Everybody know they definitely a smear 

375
00:17:14,861 --> 00:17:14,861
campaign.
Are you kidding?

376
00:17:14,861 --> 00:17:16,220
But,
but isn't a smear campaign or is it just

377
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:18,890
that they're saying things that he's 
saying that aren't correct?

378
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,250
Not just him.
He's just.

379
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,480
I understand it's common sense date 
maybe.

380
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,060
Okay.
It's just bright,

381
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:30,100
but I don't know.
I don't know anything about making 

382
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,771
buildings.
I don't know anything about what it 

383
00:17:32,771 --> 00:17:32,771
takes for a building to collapse.
I don't know.

384
00:17:32,771 --> 00:17:33,770
Totally.
I don't know either.

385
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,340
Maybe it got hot.
I believe not just hot,

386
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:42,341
it's diesel tanks were in the basement.
I want to believe that.

387
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,440
I want to believe that it fires made it 
hot and I don't want to believe they 

388
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,700
blew it up because that's fucking scary.
I wonder,

389
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,070
want to believe the fire.

390
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:55,130
If a fire is in a basement and the fire 
has diesel fuel and it's burning it,

391
00:17:55,151 --> 00:17:57,610
some insane temperature in this fucking 
shit.

392
00:17:57,611 --> 00:18:01,230
Loads of diesel fuel down there.
I wonder what effect that has.

393
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,550
I don't know.
Do you?

394
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,390
Uh,
I,

395
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,660
I'm pretty sure based on my life's 
experience,

396
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,690
that that's not going to bring down a 
building fuel life experience based on 

397
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,680
common sense.
It's common sense that,

398
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,860
yeah,
for building the building's going to 

399
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:18,860
fall at free fall speed,
boom.

400
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,641
Like that.
If a engineer after engineer after 

401
00:18:22,641 --> 00:18:24,900
engineer at some point,
I'm going to believe them at some point.

402
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,990
I'm not going to understand it,
but I don't.

403
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,910
I don't know if you'd necessarily looked
into engineers at disagree.

404
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,110
I know there's a smear campaign.
They're okay,

405
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,580
but have you looked into the engineers?
There's none.

406
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,890
There's none,
there's no doubt.

407
00:18:36,891 --> 00:18:40,320
There's no documentary,
there's no documentary mentoring.

408
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,240
Find a documentary if they have to make 
a documentary for it to make sense.

409
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,800
What was that?
What if it's an article?

410
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:49,170
What if it's a peer reviewed paper?
What if it's some sort of.

411
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:50,360
Those are all,
dude,

412
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:52,350
that's a smear campaign.
There's that side.

413
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:54,420
There's the elite that don't want this 
out.

414
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,550
And then there's people trying to get 
the truth out.

415
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,590
So the elite have the control of the 
media.

416
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:03,750
So how are you going to.
They have paid shills or you don't think

417
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:08,780
you think that they dropped.
They would have dropped the ball big 

418
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,271
time.
Like earnest byner in 1987 for the 

419
00:19:11,271 --> 00:19:11,271
browns.
It would have dropped the ball if you're

420
00:19:11,271 --> 00:19:13,890
not,
if you don't have paid shills online.

421
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,480
Strategically pushing the agenda.
Come on.

422
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,160
Okay.
Were we about to pull up?

423
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,630
There's a bunch of fake shit on him.
What?

424
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:21,990
Jamie?

425
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:25,750
As I was stuck on this Richard Gauge 
thing that I was trying to debunk,

426
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,360
see if anybody's debunking him.
Uh,

427
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:28,940
I'm looking at.

428
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,090
He's just a character.

429
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,580
I'm looking around.
I'm just looking around.

430
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The Boston Globe article says that 
there's a small vocal subset of people 

431
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,580
of engineers that are with this Richard 
Gauge Guide read.

432
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,070
I've never read that.
It was like some overwhelming number.

433
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,020
Just keep.
Keep stirring.

434
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,780
It's.
It's hard because it's fun.

435
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,720
It's exciting.
It's exciting to think that there's some

436
00:19:53,721 --> 00:19:58,721
sort of a gigantic ball of super 
geniuses that run the world and they 

437
00:19:58,721 --> 00:19:59,810
decided to blow up tower seven.
You know what's funny about the moon?

438
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,760
Fucked ourselves.
Jesus.

439
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,220
Talk about the.
You know,

440
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,240
what's crazy about the moon?
What is the hardest shit ever 

441
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,650
accomplished?
The greatest by the human race.

442
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,830
The greatest accomplishment was landing 
on the moon.

443
00:20:15,831 --> 00:20:16,520
Right?
Right.

444
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,220
So you would think,
holy shit balls.

445
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,900
I don't know what.
Listen.

446
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:21,980
Okay.
Okay.

447
00:20:21,981 --> 00:20:26,240
But let's just at the time.
At the time the Internet is the biggest.

448
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:26,990
Okay.
Okay.

449
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:28,760
But I'm just talking about like a 
physical achievement.

450
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:34,210
Three dudes,
they got shot up in a rocket that were 

451
00:20:34,551 --> 00:20:37,720
in a,
like a orbiter and then the orbiter shot

452
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,080
out the lunar,
like the lamb,

453
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,200
and then it lands.
They played golf,

454
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,110
Went Dune bug riding,
did donuts in the sand.

455
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,980
They get take pictures.
They get back

456
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,980
in,
take off dock with that orbiter and then

457
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:56,650
fly back.
That's the hardest she'd ever.

458
00:20:56,651 --> 00:20:59,140
No one died.
Can you imagine?

459
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:04,170
Can you imagine that second mission,
six months later they did it again when 

460
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:08,820
when they had to break the news that 
they were going to use different 

461
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,790
astronauts because every mission they 
use different astronauts.

462
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:14,850
Wouldn't you think they would like a 
show like have the same star over and 

463
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,240
over.
The three dudes have pulled it off.

464
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,490
Keep doing it.
They do know.

465
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,910
You're kidding.
They did it before.

466
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,050
Yeah,
but they don't want to keep doing it.

467
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,300
What the fuck you want me?
What if.

468
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,740
What if I got it?
Thank God.

469
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:27,430
What if they were planning on using buzz
Aldrin and Neil Armstrong,

470
00:21:27,431 --> 00:21:32,431
but they just fucking got an ego shit.
They started going to clubs and like 

471
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:38,690
they want to renegotiate their contract 
because they probably went to the moon 

472
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:38,690
for like,
you know,

473
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,010
$70,000.

474
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:44,210
You know what I mean?
They've got that government check that 

475
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:44,650
go.
We'll put you on the second album on the

476
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:47,650
second it just like the record business.
You know what I mean?

477
00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:49,450
My bachelor's now album,
we make that much.

478
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,980
Of course they say,
listen,

479
00:21:50,981 --> 00:21:53,200
we'll get you on that second,
on the second and third.

480
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:57,540
Land means how much money you're gonna 
make you're gonna.

481
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,650
Come back,
you're gonna.

482
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:03,670
Be famous.
You can be fucking doing all sorts of 

483
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:03,670
press.
Think about the bitches.

484
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,450
Think about the coke.
All that shit.

485
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,650
They probably got blowed out and got too
cocky and wanted to renegotiate.

486
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,270
Oh my God.
And then NASA said,

487
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:14,470
we just got to go with some new dudes.
They made $8 per diem.

488
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,580
When Uncle Sam folks,
you raw dog,

489
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:22,990
he uses sand.
Uncle Sam uses broken class on his dick.

490
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:27,991
When you guys went to the moon,
why wouldn't you think there was enough?

491
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,440
That dude in the middle,
the dude in the middle,

492
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,400
in the middle,
didn't actually,

493
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:38,630
was hovering in an orbiter.
He was hovering in an orbiter and they 

494
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:43,291
landed some little piece of shit.
A Lunar Lander would have the land and 

495
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:46,240
then they took and they show.
The only time I ever,

496
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:51,241
they got one shot of it taken off and 
whatever was filming it followed it all 

497
00:22:51,241 --> 00:22:55,010
the way up,
but who was the official story?

498
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:01,890
There was a live remote controlled.
That's what they said that they could 

499
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,010
control from for.
From Houston,

500
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
for sure.
That works,

501
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:11,040
dude.
I couldn't get my phone to work on the 

502
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,580
moon.
Landings are so God damn ridiculous.

503
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:17,700
Oh fuck.
There's video of them like just maybe a 

504
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,800
100,000
feet in the air and they like filming 

505
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:22,800
it,
making it look,

506
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:22,800
you know,
there are many emulating.

507
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,330
What the fuck come on.
That video stream.

508
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,360
That's a damning.
The explaining what they were doing.

509
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,660
Well the video says that they're saying 
they're at 30,000

510
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:36,760
miles out.
That's what they're saying.

511
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,250
Something like that.
Halfway to the moon,

512
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,480
that would like a 125,000
miles away from Earth.

513
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,890
So halfway halfway to and make it look 
like never far away.

514
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:51,260
So you know,
if they look out their window,

515
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:54,130
that little circle or whatever shape,
maybe it was a rectangle,

516
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:59,140
whatever the window it,
the entire earth fills up all the glass 

517
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,660
of course.
Because you're like still.

518
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,800
Well it's.
You got to remember they blocked out all

519
00:24:04,801 --> 00:24:06,980
the other windows.
That was what was in damning about it.

520
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,200
What's damning about it is that they've 
got this camera setup where they're 

521
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,921
filming the blackness of the interior of
the cabin and the circular window and 

522
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,370
it's circular windows supposed to 
represent earth.

523
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,400
This little slice of earth with clouds 
on it and shit and the blend that kind 

524
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,370
of stands still trying to create the.
I don't know if that's real.

525
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,990
See,
I've looked at that a hundred times.

526
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:30,050
It might've just been lucky.
This is exactly what I think more than 

527
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,070
anything more more likely.
It was just like,

528
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,590
yeah,
that's fake.

529
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,320
And now that the watch,
this is what you could see.

530
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:40,050
You can see,
oh this is just you gotta.

531
00:24:40,051 --> 00:24:42,750
You gotta go to the one where it shows 
the actual fake footage.

532
00:24:42,751 --> 00:24:46,950
This is the actual video is not going to
show the full thing where they pull away

533
00:24:46,951 --> 00:24:51,951
and you see the guys manipulated the 
dampers and pulling the things off the 

534
00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:55,311
wall.
The new reveals what it reveals that 

535
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:55,311
they're in low earth orbit,
that they're not really

536
00:24:55,311 --> 00:25:00,210
just looking at Hawaii.
It's like the little hole and they're 

537
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,240
focusing on a little island.
Google Bart Sabril

538
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,710
is.
I had A.

539
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,440
I had dinner with this gentleman back in
the day.

540
00:25:04,441 --> 00:25:09,441
He's very nice guy and he's the guy that
wrote a funny thing happened on the way 

541
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,571
to the moon and he's absolutely 
convinced that they never went to the 

542
00:25:12,571 --> 00:25:13,750
moon.
He was a not a dumb guy.

543
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,460
I had an interesting conversation with 
him.

544
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,850
He's fully onboard and absolutely 
committed and not,

545
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:22,060
not that they couldn't do it or that 
they,

546
00:25:22,061 --> 00:25:23,650
uh,
they couldn't get the footage of it,

547
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,470
but that they faked the whole thing.
Like they never even did.

548
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:31,500
Everyone went out there.
Some people think that they couldn't 

549
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,351
film it.
They went there but they couldn't film 

550
00:25:34,351 --> 00:25:34,351
it.
So these,

551
00:25:34,351 --> 00:25:36,271
this fake film of that.
But that there was other ways to track 

552
00:25:36,271 --> 00:25:36,280
whether or not they went there.
There's some people that believe that,

553
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,610
and then other people believe.
No,

554
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:37,780
no,
no,

555
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,860
no.
It's all fake.

556
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,980
It's all fake from the jump.
They shot them into low earth orbit.

557
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,580
They float around in low earth orbit and
then drop back down.

558
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,520
I believe that.
I believe it was.

559
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,320
It's just a scam.
They're just making money and they're.

560
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:54,350
And they're showing.
That was a distraction for the va from 

561
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:59,181
the Vietnam War.
All six missions during Richard Nixon 

562
00:25:59,181 --> 00:26:02,370
administration.
They did one every six months with 

563
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:02,370
different astronauts.
No one got hurt.

564
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,090
No one died.
Are you kidding me?

565
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,760
You ever see the video footage from the 
first man in space?

566
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:11,810
The video footage,
the first manned space is so entirely 

567
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:11,810
fake.
It's fucking hilarious.

568
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:12,360
Guy.
Russia?

569
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,470
No,
the guy from Russia,

570
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,840
the Russian guy,
he did go into space,

571
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,410
but they didn't have a fucking camera 
crew inside the capsule with them.

572
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:24,650
There's like opposing lights and 
different like you could see like if 

573
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,950
there's a distance between the guy,
but it's so fake.

574
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:31,040
It's always been propaganda.
Put up Google fake video footage of 

575
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,150
first man in orbit.
What is it?

576
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,150
What was the Russian cat's name?
The first dude that went into orbit.

577
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:43,010
But uh,
they have a video footage of him inside 

578
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:43,010
his car.

579
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:50,030
Oh,
leg room was all like tech was one of 

580
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,000
the first leg lock guys ever.
Right.

581
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:57,310
You had to watch your shit with him.
He would sambo the shit out of your 

582
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:00,141
legs.
Remember there was like a few leg locks 

583
00:27:00,141 --> 00:27:00,141
back in the day.
Just a few.

584
00:27:00,141 --> 00:27:00,190
Yep.
No,

585
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,150
you know,
the craziest thing I found out I thought

586
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:08,750
heel hooks for sure were legal and sambo
and apparently they're not even legal 

587
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:08,750
and samba.
Oh my God.

588
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:12,000
They just do straight ankle locks and 
bars and it was because of the shoot and

589
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:17,001
calf cranks.
They all wear shoes and no heel hooks 

590
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:17,001
and samba.
That's crazy.

591
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:20,410
What do you think about shoes?
She be allowed to wear shoes were either

592
00:27:20,411 --> 00:27:22,660
at fighting or in grappling.
No,

593
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,120
no.
Yeah,

594
00:27:24,121 --> 00:27:25,980
I agree.
I think gloves too,

595
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:31,360
but then I'm a broken record with that.
Did you find it video of just find fake 

596
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,180
video from Diane face tends to my work 
shoes.

597
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:38,210
Fuck it.
Problem is mma like kick you and that 

598
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:40,160
goes in your eye.
What is this footage?

599
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,690
No,
no,

600
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:43,080
no,
no.

601
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:45,540
This is the moon landing.
So Soviet moon landing.

602
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,220
Now,
first man in orbit.

603
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,950
Um,
it's inside the cockpit.

604
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:54,951
It's like a NASA faking a earth.
NASA first man and,

605
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:03,470
or regression.
Not just put NASA faking or what was the

606
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:04,410
guy's name?

607
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,260
Who was the first,
uh,

608
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,900
first man in orbit.
What's near Gagarin.

609
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:13,320
Okay,
so go Yuri Gagarin a video.

610
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,190
You could see the video.
So he climbs into this thing.

611
00:28:17,191 --> 00:28:22,191
He takes off and then see if you can 
find the first person like staring at 

612
00:28:23,731 --> 00:28:23,970
him.

613
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,210
There's a bunch of it where it's like,
so clearly not really happening.

614
00:28:29,211 --> 00:28:30,220
It's all fake,
man.

615
00:28:30,221 --> 00:28:32,170
They're all faking it.
The Russians are faking it.

616
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,200
They're all,
they're all doing it together where 

617
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,200
there's no real cold war.
But there was a,

618
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,490
a,
some sort of a

619
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,880
video on the analysis of that saying 
that there's light sources in there.

620
00:28:42,881 --> 00:28:47,881
There wouldn't be a light source inside 
that cabin that you'd be able to film 

621
00:28:47,881 --> 00:28:51,211
with and how far away with the camera 
have to be to capture this and they had 

622
00:28:51,211 --> 00:28:52,660
these big ass clunky cameras and it 
wasn't that kind of space.

623
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:57,850
Think about,
think about TV and the movies when they 

624
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:00,020
were born.
What were they ever about?

625
00:29:00,021 --> 00:29:01,940
Like what's really going on?
You know,

626
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:05,150
I dream of Jeannie was right away.
It's right away.

627
00:29:05,151 --> 00:29:07,370
It's total bullshit right away from day 
one.

628
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:12,371
It's never.
There was never a show about what life 

629
00:29:12,371 --> 00:29:14,741
really is.
It was always bullshit right from the 

630
00:29:14,741 --> 00:29:14,741
start,
right from the Getgo,

631
00:29:14,741 --> 00:29:17,360
propaganda.
They didn't create TV for entertainment.

632
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,670
You kidding me?
Oh,

633
00:29:19,671 --> 00:29:21,440
let's entertain them.
CVC,

634
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,890
it's not like one super genius wants to 
create something called TV and then they

635
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:30,120
use that tv to manipulate the world.
What happens is one super genius figures

636
00:29:30,121 --> 00:29:35,121
out a way to take a visual image and 
projected into millions of different 

637
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:36,800
televisions at the same time.
Who's paying this?

638
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,730
Hold on a second because he's a 
technologist,

639
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,880
so he figures out how to do it.
They start things through this and then 

640
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,420
the powers that be realize what kind of 
manipulation you could get out of 

641
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:53,100
something like that where you could show
the news every night and presidential 

642
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,560
addresses and then they started using it
for their own good,

643
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:56,470
but it wasn't created to control 
people's brains.

644
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:01,680
It was created because people have this 
inherent desire to constantly innovate 

645
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,370
and make better and better shit.
We don't even know why we do it,

646
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,080
but we're fucking obsessed with it.

647
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,090
So these technologists,
to create it,

648
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:12,340
they.
They're so far smarter than any of the 

649
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:12,340
people that use it and manipulate 
people.

650
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,920
The people that created the ones that 
actually understand how to make a 

651
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,180
digital signal with your phone stream 
live and periscope and a guy who was in 

652
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:25,531
New Zealand can look at it in real time 
while you're talking about something 

653
00:30:25,531 --> 00:30:29,810
would be a good idea for the Illuminati 
that seek people like that out and hire 

654
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:30,310
them.
Wouldn't that be a good move?

655
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,610
That's definitely a good hell yeah.
You go after those dudes wearing a man,

656
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,620
I think black male.
Um Damn.

657
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:40,740
You got them.
Companies work directly with military 

658
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,070
and they get billy to military contracts
to make all kinds of shit they always 

659
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,940
have,
whether it's computer stuff,

660
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,130
whether it's surveillance equipment,
what I mean,

661
00:30:48,131 --> 00:30:52,180
there's lucrative contracts like that 
was the big thing about the Iraq war,

662
00:30:52,181 --> 00:30:52,450
right?

663
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:56,920
Like everybody was terrified of the fact
that you had this guy who was the ceo of

664
00:30:56,921 --> 00:31:01,921
Halliburton,
which is a company that cleans up after 

665
00:31:01,921 --> 00:31:06,061
we blow shit up and that guy becomes the
vice president and then they start 

666
00:31:06,061 --> 00:31:09,430
getting these giant no bid contracts to 
clean shit up after we blow it up.

667
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,370
Like the money involved in something 
like that is insane,

668
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,660
right?
You're talking just hundreds of millions

669
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,290
of dollars just flowing like water,
right?

670
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:20,650
It's just constantly flowing.
So if you think about that,

671
00:31:20,651 --> 00:31:25,651
you think about that.
That's going to be the case with 

672
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:27,871
everything.
If they have the kind of money to throw 

673
00:31:27,871 --> 00:31:27,871
that way towards the Afghan war,
what,

674
00:31:27,871 --> 00:31:30,610
what kind of black ops money do they 
have to make those jets unlimited?

675
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,890
Those stills crazy.
Fucking stealth.

676
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:37,891
Generally as much trillions are 
constantly missing in the Pentagon at 

677
00:31:38,321 --> 00:31:42,670
back in right before nine slash 11.
It was two point 3 trillion missing from

678
00:31:42,671 --> 00:31:43,080
the Pentagon.

679
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:45,340
Literally a couple days before,
but yeah,

680
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:48,400
the day before Donald Rumsfeld,
everyone knows about that,

681
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,380
but like now I'm done.
Now it's like,

682
00:31:50,381 --> 00:31:53,530
oh,
17 trillion are missing two,

683
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,680
two point 3 trillion was bad.
Where's all this money going?

684
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,120
Exactly.
Trillions.

685
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,240
Trillions.
Yeah.

686
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:04,770
This is where it's at,
but here's what you're saying is not 

687
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:04,770
crazy.
Like people are listening to this.

688
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:09,571
There's a lot of people that are 
listening to this that have never heard 

689
00:32:09,571 --> 00:32:09,571
this before,
and they think,

690
00:32:09,571 --> 00:32:09,571
well,
this is crazy.

691
00:32:09,571 --> 00:32:14,100
These guys are just making shit up.
This is some loony fucking left wing 

692
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:14,460
conspiracy theory.
Yay.

693
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:18,700
You guys think that the government was 
in on this and that it was all a scam to

694
00:32:18,701 --> 00:32:21,250
hide the fact that they'd stolen 
trillions of dollars,

695
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
but they really did have a press 
conference and it's really available 

696
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,811
online and Donald Rumsfeld really does 
look straight at the camera and he 

697
00:32:30,811 --> 00:32:32,680
really does say they're missing 
trillions of dollars.

698
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:35,980
Two point 3 trillion,
trillion trillion.

699
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:39,770
That's a thousand billion and then the 
day

700
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:45,700
nine slash 11 hits a plane or a bomb 
blows up a small little section of the 

701
00:32:48,441 --> 00:32:51,980
Pentagon where all the people that are 
auditing the Pentagon,

702
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,630
the Accounting Office blows up and 
everyone coincidence,

703
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:00,640
bro.
It's a total coincidence that she could 

704
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:00,640
really happen.
Listen to me,

705
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,781
man.
No one would ever kill someone for as 

706
00:33:04,781 --> 00:33:06,980
little as two point $3,000,000,000,000.
That's not enough money to get people to

707
00:33:06,981 --> 00:33:08,330
kill people.
It's just not.

708
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,590
People need more money to kill people.
People kill people for like 50,

709
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,440
except she gave so really shitty guy who
would kill somebody for like a thousand 

710
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,870
dollars.
Shit is so corrupt and it's always been 

711
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:22,870
listening to Donald Rumsfeld talk about 
this.

712
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,870
Oh,
how dare you talk her over guy.

713
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:32,890
See if he could find the actual video of
him talking because it's pretty 

714
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:32,990
fascinating.
It's just a couple minutes.

715
00:33:32,991 --> 00:33:34,930
Donald Rumsfeld.
Yeah.

716
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:38,420
That's a lot of money down.
Whereas that carries a shitload of them.

717
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,440
Where'd it go,
son?

718
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:41,600
Um,
yeah.

719
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:46,601
This is,
that's not the full video of him 

720
00:33:46,601 --> 00:33:46,940
actually saying it,
but nine slash 11.

721
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Donald Rumsfeld,
trillion guaranteed a bunch of no one 

722
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,450
ever talked about it again.
That was great.

723
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,310
The second one,
boom.

724
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,420
What's crazy is it really didn't get 
brought up after that.

725
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:00,970
Let's listen to it on reinsurance.

726
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,390
Same time.
$7,000,000,000,000

727
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:08,150
in transactions.
Two point 3 trillion,

728
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:15,820
2000,
one 10th of September ends according to 

729
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,361
some estimates.
We cannot track two point 

730
00:34:19,361 --> 00:34:19,361
$3,000,000,000,000
in transactions.

731
00:34:19,361 --> 00:34:24,130
Two point 3 trillion with a t.
The very next day,

732
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:29,810
according to the accounting offices were
destroyed in the Pentagon to two point 3

733
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:32,810
trillion was never brought up again.
Who's more gangster than that?

734
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,470
They got they go,
dude,

735
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,210
we just got to say something because you
could take the trillions,

736
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:43,330
but we got to make.
We got to admit it and then everyone's 

737
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:43,330
gonna.
Forget about it.

738
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,890
What did people say to that?
That's one of the one,

739
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:46,790
one of those ones where what does 
people.

740
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:51,500
What do people say to the idea that the 
plane would hit the perfect spot to hide

741
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:54,770
the two point three trillions of dollars
in debt to for you,

742
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,590
for someone to know,
to admit to themselves,

743
00:34:57,591 --> 00:35:02,591
they'll say,
everybody will admit the government is 

744
00:35:02,591 --> 00:35:04,280
corrupt,
but when something gets brought up,

745
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,770
they're always believe in the government
side.

746
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,090
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah,

747
00:35:08,091 --> 00:35:10,720
but this one doesn't even have a side.
Here's the thing.

748
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,020
Still watched that and know that was 
fishy shit.

749
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,070
Nine slash 11.
I don't trust it and everything.

750
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,260
Every now you got to look at nine slash 
11.

751
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,420
If you see that and you don't look at 
nine slash 11,

752
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:22,440
what?
Skeptical eyes there.

753
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,050
You're hypnotized.
Well,

754
00:35:24,051 --> 00:35:27,830
that alone is one of those Arsenio Hall 
segments.

755
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:29,670
Things that make you go,
hmm,

756
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,050
come on man.
Cool.

757
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:36,130
You're going to trust.
You know you're doing like if you were 

758
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:38,100
doing business with this organization 
and then you saw a speech by

759
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,620
the chairman of that organization and he
just said,

760
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:44,640
we're missing a $55,000,000,000.
Would you still want a new business with

761
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:46,260
this guy?
Look at this one.

762
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:51,410
Trillion's go missing from the military.
Pentagon can account for six point 5 

763
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,140
trillion in tax payer cash.
Cash.

764
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,990
No one can but.
But everyone.

765
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,560
The official story,
I believe the official story that they 

766
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,710
wouldn't do that.
They wouldn't do that.

767
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,610
Yeah,
they're are corrupt,

768
00:36:02,611 --> 00:36:04,080
but they wouldn't do that.
Yeah,

769
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:04,860
they're evil.
Yeah,

770
00:36:04,861 --> 00:36:06,930
but they wouldn't do that.
It's like it doesn't make any sense.

771
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,210
The report review,
look at this.

772
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,990
They cannot provide adequate 
documentation for how it spent.

773
00:36:12,991 --> 00:36:16,620
Six point 5 trillion.
That is hilarious.

774
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,020
How do they,
how do they not all go to jail?

775
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,380
How nobody.
Nobody's going to jail.

776
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,350
You know,
Illuminati.

777
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,210
Nobody goes to jail.
Your richest.

778
00:36:24,211 --> 00:36:26,520
Fuck I know,
but this is into satanism.

779
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:31,550
The people that go to people that have 
the money that our taxes go to,

780
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,430
like they have it.

781
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,390
Our taxes,
we spend the money or we buy,

782
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,730
we get the money.
We sent it to them.

783
00:36:35,731 --> 00:36:40,731
They have it.
They can't account for six point 5 

784
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:41,490
trillion.
That's so much money.

785
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:46,491
That's crazy.
That's like he's in the national debt 

786
00:36:46,491 --> 00:36:48,960
like 13 trillion or something.
What's the national debt is higher.

787
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,620
I might've made that up.
Yeah,

788
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,080
your trillion.
What do you think it is?

789
00:36:52,081 --> 00:36:55,760
We think the national debt is to have no
fucking I,

790
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:58,500
it doesn't even matter.
It doesn't matter what the data.

791
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,740
$6,000,000,000,000
and nobody's going to jail.

792
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:04,890
But what I'm saying is it's half of the,
I think it might be like half a national

793
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,730
debt.
Nobody.

794
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,160
Nobody in the Illuminati goes to the 
jail.

795
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:12,030
That our national debt is 20 point 4 
trillion,

796
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:17,300
which we cannot pay,
but we can't account for six point 5 

797
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,070
trillion.
Why even account for it anymore?

798
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,220
Just at this point.

799
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,940
Just fucking.
Just say,

800
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,410
shut up.
Fuck it.

801
00:37:22,411 --> 00:37:25,420
Let's just cross our fingers.
Yeah.

802
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,860
Well there was an article that was 
written about,

803
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:33,890
uh,
the idea that our country was going to 

804
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:36,270
descend slowly into something that's not
on democracy anymore.

805
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,170
And uh,
the argument you would make if you don't

806
00:37:40,171 --> 00:37:45,171
have to account for trillions of dollars
that you make us pay for the argument 

807
00:37:45,171 --> 00:37:46,050
would be.
That might have already happened.

808
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,450
Like where it's all about money and 
control,

809
00:37:48,451 --> 00:37:53,451
right?
What more money are you going to get 

810
00:37:53,451 --> 00:37:54,480
then?
Six and a half trillion dollars,

811
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,700
like if it's really all just about money
and control,

812
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,410
that's a shitload of money and well,
what's the control?

813
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:04,411
The control is it's rarely discussed 
like there's all sorts of outrageous 

814
00:38:04,411 --> 00:38:06,420
like transgender people using the 
women's room.

815
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,070
Once you're in the Illuminati,
you're above the motherfucking lot.

816
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,730
Nobody's going to jail.

817
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:15,180
They're all fucking doing crazy shit.
Nobody goes to jail.

818
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,940
Nobody in the Pentagon's going to jail.
Are you kidding me?

819
00:38:17,941 --> 00:38:20,310
No one in the CIA's going to jail.
They're not going to jail.

820
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:25,340
I understand,
but what's crazy is that no one taught 

821
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,500
here a further mysteries.
What happened to thousands of documents 

822
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,910
that should be on file but aren't the 
ige study found that F A.

823
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:34,050
I don't know what that is.
Did not document or or support why?

824
00:38:34,051 --> 00:38:39,051
The defense reporting system removed at 
least 16,500,

825
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:44,680
13 of one point 3 million records during
quarter three.

826
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:50,010
Fiscal year 2015 as a result of the data
used to prepare the fiscal year 2015 

827
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,090
egf.
I don't know what that is.

828
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,480
A third quarter and year end financial 
statements were unreliable and lacked 

829
00:38:58,361 --> 00:39:03,361
and adequate audit trail.
So they just started yanking 

830
00:39:03,361 --> 00:39:03,940
transactions and deleting.
I believe them.

831
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:04,870
Oh,
what else?

832
00:39:04,871 --> 00:39:05,650
Now,
how does that work?

833
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:08,200
If they,
if they have black ops,

834
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:11,410
like what we're talking about before.
So if they have like area 51,

835
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,140
which is like groom lake,
you know,

836
00:39:14,141 --> 00:39:19,141
that whole area in Nevada where it's 
illegal to even get close to where they 

837
00:39:19,141 --> 00:39:20,410
were supposedly develop and stealth 
bombers and all that shit.

838
00:39:20,411 --> 00:39:21,790
They did all that stuff out there.
Right?

839
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,330
How much they get and how do they,
how does that money work?

840
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:30,570
Because that is that where all the 
money's going to crazy military 

841
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,390
projects.
Like what does a black cop,

842
00:39:31,391 --> 00:39:33,040
you know what I'm saying?
Like if they say black ops,

843
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:38,041
right?
Is that why they cannot account for 

844
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:38,041
that?
I mean,

845
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:38,950
isn't that makes sense?
If they're spending trillions of dollars

846
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:42,070
making these crazy fucking jets and it's
missing.

847
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,100
Yeah.
But,

848
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,270
but is that what it means?
I wonder if that's what it means.

849
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:51,830
I wonder if it means that this is just 
some shit they get to just do whatever 

850
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,640
the fuck they want with and they build 
these crazy bases and they do whatever.

851
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:54,790
Sonic jets,
you know what I mean?

852
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:58,360
Can you imagine the people at the top,
like the islands they have and shit.

853
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:03,390
Queue management pieces.
They've got pieces of land that we know 

854
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:06,780
nothing about.
Now what Janet budget has it like an 

855
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,350
area for classified programs.
So they spent like $59 billion on 

856
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:10,840
classified programs.
Oh,

857
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:13,330
so the six point 5 trillion is on top of
that.

858
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:18,410
Yeah.
Maybe classified programs is one level 

859
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:21,360
of top secret and it gets all the way 
down to where we deconstruct alien 

860
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,040
spacecrafts.
That's like that Robert Lasar type shit.

861
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,710
You ever see that guys videos?
Yeah.

862
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:30,340
We checked we were 15 years ago and um,
I don't,

863
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:32,710
I don't know where I am still 
fascinated.

864
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:36,400
That guy's just a little tom because 
he's still alive.

865
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:39,100
Yeah.
Can you imagine him on this podcast?

866
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,530
That would be free cash within the 
government.

867
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,970
I think he's really cool.

868
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:48,140
You know what he's friends with John 
Lear and that guy says the most crazy,

869
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:53,820
crazy sean.
This is his secrets are that there's 

870
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,140
people,
there's millions of people on Venus,

871
00:40:56,141 --> 00:40:58,490
there's millions of people on Mars 
there.

872
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:03,810
There's people all over the on every 
planet and and they're just not telling 

873
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:06,070
us about that,
but isn't John Lear like,

874
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,980
do you think that it's possible?
I'm just gonna throw this out there.

875
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,870
Do you think it's possible that John 
Lear,

876
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,300
who's like some soup,
isn't he a super billionaire character?

877
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:17,590
He was a former CIA pilot.
He was in the CIA for many years.

878
00:41:17,591 --> 00:41:22,591
Once you're in the cio,
he's in his but isn't any like some 

879
00:41:22,591 --> 00:41:25,501
super wealthy businessman.
I don't know how we're thinking about 

880
00:41:25,501 --> 00:41:27,991
lear jets.
Jets is like his father created lear 

881
00:41:27,991 --> 00:41:29,020
jets,
but is he a super wealthy businessman?

882
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:34,050
He should be.
I was thinking if I was one of those 

883
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:34,130
guys and I was bored,
I might just be trolling

884
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,530
the fuck out of people telling them 
about people on Mars.

885
00:41:36,531 --> 00:41:38,300
That's what he's doing,
what?

886
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,600
He's doing it for fun and and they let 
him.

887
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,980
They let him in the Illuminati.
If he does that and he's like,

888
00:41:42,981 --> 00:41:44,540
fuck yeah,
that was already in.

889
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:49,810
He's probably like,
what you can't deny is things like 

890
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:50,590
Bohemian Grove.
Here's what you can tonight.

891
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,640
Like I'm,
I'm warm.

892
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,680
I'm on the skeptical side of all 
conspiracy theories.

893
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,200
I don't get me wrong out there.
I'm not.

894
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:00,830
I'm not going after anybody.
I'm not trying to indict anybody.

895
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,580
I feel like there's just too many people
are hypnotized to really stop anything.

896
00:42:04,581 --> 00:42:06,650
You can't stop these trillions of 
dollars missing.

897
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,180
How are you going to do that?
Who's gonna?

898
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,170
Who's gonna?
Stop that.

899
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,360
Here's like,
it's,

900
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:13,580
it's a man.
Too many people are hypnotized.

901
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:14,300
It's just,
it's,

902
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,510
it's hopeless sometimes,
you know.

903
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,990
Okay.
What I'm saying is that what you see,

904
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:24,010
these things that you can't deny and one
of the things he can't deny as Bohemian 

905
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:27,821
Grove,
Bohemian Grove is a place where these 

906
00:42:27,821 --> 00:42:30,701
leaders and these bankers and he's 
elites of the world literally do get 

907
00:42:30,701 --> 00:42:35,111
together and put it on fucking robes and
they get in front of a giant stone owl 

908
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:39,020
and they have a like a ceremony and they
burned some sticks.

909
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:42,000
They burn an effigy.
It's like the,

910
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,990
when Alex Jones was the first guy to 
find that like you,

911
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:49,940
you can criticize Alex Jones all you 
want and a lot of it's deserved.

912
00:42:49,941 --> 00:42:54,170
He says a lot of crazy shit and he's a 
character and he gets big and theatrical

913
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:59,171
and it's fun,
but he's exposed some very real shit 

914
00:42:59,171 --> 00:43:03,581
that's undeniable.
And one of the things that's undeniable 

915
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,370
is that there really is a place called 
Bohemian Grove over.

916
00:43:04,371 --> 00:43:09,371
These guys really do get together and 
they'd get together and they put on 

917
00:43:09,371 --> 00:43:10,910
robes and they worshiped this mole,
the,

918
00:43:10,911 --> 00:43:15,911
our God.
That's something that's been going on 

919
00:43:15,911 --> 00:43:18,431
forever.
That's where people thought Alex was a 

920
00:43:18,431 --> 00:43:19,130
shield because he would say all this 
great nine slash 11 stuff,

921
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:19,880
9:11
stuff.

922
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:25,150
And then he would say he would work into
the world's run by Satanic pedophiles,

923
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:26,300
you know?
So then people go,

924
00:43:26,301 --> 00:43:27,200
okay,
is this shell?

925
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,400
He's a shell.
You know?

926
00:43:28,401 --> 00:43:30,590
It's like saying it's like John Lee or 
type shit.

927
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,860
That's what it sounds like.
And that's what it sounded like.

928
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:33,990
A lot of people that go,
he's a chef,

929
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:37,390
he's talking about everyone's satanic 
and they're all pedophiles.

930
00:43:37,391 --> 00:43:37,680
He,
he's,

931
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:38,540
he's,
he's,

932
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,430
he's retarded.
He's a shill.

933
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,510
But uh,
uh,

934
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:48,250
what do,
what do you know about the Chester 

935
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:48,380
Bennington?
Bennington as suicide?

936
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:49,990
Um,
I know that he had a,

937
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:55,230
done a bunch of interviews.
We talked about being raped a bunch of 

938
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:55,230
times when I was young and how fucked up
it was.

939
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:57,570
I don't know anything other than that.
Damn,

940
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,610
I don't want to talk too much about his 
personal life.

941
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:03,960
No,
it's no personalized.

942
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:08,590
This is all I'm saying was,
was um,

943
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,500
anytime a dude kills himself.
He's got a bunch of kids.

944
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:16,520
Yeah.
But when you,

945
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:17,760
when you talk about,
you know,

946
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,220
um,
you know,

947
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:22,490
Chris Cornell and him were best friends.
Yeah.

948
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,170
You know,
the crystal themself on Chris's birthday

949
00:44:25,171 --> 00:44:25,640
right now,
what?

950
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:30,650
Chris Cornell and his wife,
they have a foundation called the Chris 

951
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,250
and Vicky Foundation and it's all about 
helping,

952
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,740
um,
uh,

953
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:39,860
children that were molested and abused 
and a lot of them were like former 

954
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:43,221
pedophile,
a child traffickers trafficky or however

955
00:44:45,181 --> 00:44:46,380
you'd say it.
Um,

956
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,150
and he was really,
really into it.

957
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:51,180
And this is this,
this is the conspiracy theory.

958
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,850
I don't know,
this is the conspiracy.

959
00:44:52,851 --> 00:44:54,740
It's not with him.
No,

960
00:44:54,741 --> 00:44:55,430
no man,
this is,

961
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:56,200
this is,
this is,

962
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,850
this is why shit is getting fucked up as
it has something to do with that.

963
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,100
There's,
um,

964
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:07,250
he was,
the conspiracy theory is that he was 

965
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:07,670
involved in stopping,
trying to,

966
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:12,780
you know,
Ashton Kutcher is trying to stop human 

967
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,070
trafficking and you know,
how a Corey Feldman,

968
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:17,160
he got an interview,
he said the biggest problem in Hollywood

969
00:45:17,161 --> 00:45:18,930
is pedophilia.
And then,

970
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:21,660
and then there's been several people 
coming out and the dude from Lord of the

971
00:45:21,661 --> 00:45:22,860
rings,
Elijah Wood,

972
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:25,380
he says many times he goes,
there's a big problem,

973
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:30,340
there's an Hollywood and everywhere 
really Hollywood and,

974
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:32,090
and,
uh,

975
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,270
Washington DC.

976
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:37,440
Do you know that a 800,000
to a million kids get kidnapped a year?

977
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,000
Do you know that?
Is that real?

978
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,050
I don't know.
Look it up.

979
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,930
I don't know.
Where'd you read that?

980
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,250
I don't know.
I mean I somewhere online,

981
00:45:44,251 --> 00:45:46,050
I don't know if it's true,
but it didn't.

982
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,430
Eight hundred to a million kids get 
kidnapped her.

983
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,970
And you know what city?
800,000

984
00:45:50,971 --> 00:45:55,971
to a million.
Eight hundred thousand to a million and 

985
00:45:55,971 --> 00:45:55,971
you know what?
What?

986
00:45:55,971 --> 00:45:56,430
Where's the biggest city where?
Washington DC.

987
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,520
Really?
Yeah.

988
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:00,750
Look how many people are kidnapped.
Oh my God.

989
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,890
Two hundred and 3000 children are 
kidnapped each year by family members.

990
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,800
800,000
children are reported missing.

991
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:11,170
Huge.
800,000

992
00:46:11,171 --> 00:46:14,310
dollars a year for missing.
How many of those were recovered?

993
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:17,340
How many people are kidnapped each day 
in the US?

994
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,260
How many children are missing in the 
United States?

995
00:46:19,261 --> 00:46:24,261
Click on that.
How many children are missing in the 

996
00:46:24,261 --> 00:46:24,261
United States?

997
00:46:24,261 --> 00:46:24,540
According to the National Center for 
Missing and exploited children,

998
00:46:24,541 --> 00:46:27,630
roughly 800,000
children are reported missing each year.

999
00:46:27,631 --> 00:46:29,850
In the United States.
That's roughly 2000 per day.

1000
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:33,120
Of those,
there are 115 child.

1001
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:38,300
Stranger abduction cases each year,
so 115 or abducted by children are 

1002
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:42,650
abducted by strangers each year,
which means the child was taken by an 

1003
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:44,370
unknown person,
so a lot of those.

1004
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:49,290
Most of those people that were abducted 
there are taken by family members,

1005
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:52,590
but it's still a shitload of people.
Even if it was 200,000,

1006
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,110
even if it was 20,000
kids a year,

1007
00:46:55,111 --> 00:46:57,270
get kidnapped,
even if it was 20,000,

1008
00:46:57,271 --> 00:47:00,840
isn't that fucking huge?
If it's 121,

1009
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:02,370
it's huge.
20,000.

1010
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,870
Yeah.
You know,

1011
00:47:03,871 --> 00:47:07,970
and it Sandy Hook was 20 so and there's 
800,000

1012
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,530
to a million and people are all over 
that.

1013
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,930
There's,
there's no one's all over it.

1014
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,280
Everyone's like,
oh,

1015
00:47:14,281 --> 00:47:17,610
that's what comes like.
It's people are aware of it.

1016
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,010
That's almost nobody.

1017
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:25,670
Nobody's aware of it,
but so many statistics when it comes to 

1018
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:28,281
like how many people die in car 
accidents and how many people are 

1019
00:47:28,281 --> 00:47:30,741
murdered,
how many people die of cancer and how 

1020
00:47:30,741 --> 00:47:32,811
many people.
There's a lot of statistics to follow 

1021
00:47:32,811 --> 00:47:32,811
them.
You know when people are,

1022
00:47:32,811 --> 00:47:34,000
you know,
there has been over time,

1023
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:37,710
you know that there's been a few people 
that have been suicidal but like really,

1024
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:42,720
really murdered,
but they would call it a recent ones 

1025
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,080
that were connected to Hillary Clinton 
where people were like,

1026
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:44,630
is that.
Explain that?

1027
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,800
What is that two of them do?
Do you know the ones I'm talking about?

1028
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:48,330
James,
this is,

1029
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:51,550
this isn't about Haiti,
there's a Haiti thing going on.

1030
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:53,920
There's a Haiti and is just a new one.

1031
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:58,940
Yeah.
He was supposed to testify about the 

1032
00:47:58,940 --> 00:47:58,940
money and the Clinton Foundation.
I mean that's what they said.

1033
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:00,090
I don't know if he's officially gonna 
testify about that,

1034
00:48:00,091 --> 00:48:01,740
but the city was going to at least talk 
about it.

1035
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,800
Yeah.
There was two dudes that died in the 

1036
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,610
same month during this 30 day period.
And they said they got suicided.

1037
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:08,580
Yeah,
they both killed.

1038
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:11,260
Killed themselves.
They both to testify.

1039
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:16,340
So who knows?
Maybe they were really depressed and 

1040
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:16,610
maybe maybe.
Here you go.

1041
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:21,590
Our former Haiti government officials 
shoots himself in the head in Miami Area

1042
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:22,100
Hotel.
My God.

1043
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:22,990
Come on.
Yeah,

1044
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:24,250
here and what,
what,

1045
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:25,170
what,
what was he doing?

1046
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:29,190
He was getting ready to testify.
So was there another one?

1047
00:48:29,191 --> 00:48:34,191
Find another one.
There was another one that was really 

1048
00:48:34,191 --> 00:48:34,191
recent.
It was in the same.

1049
00:48:34,191 --> 00:48:35,200
Was that July that you just looked down 
the other one?

1050
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,350
The other one was a girl.
It was a female.

1051
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,060
Was it?
Yeah,

1052
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:43,080
she was at part of the investigation.
Ends up suiciding herself like an 

1053
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,070
episode of the fucking house of cards.
Man,

1054
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,770
isn't that crazy?
So obviously who knows,

1055
00:48:46,771 --> 00:48:49,350
maybe that were really depressed and 
they wanted to shoot their brains out.

1056
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,000
Maybe we don't know.
We don't know,

1057
00:48:51,001 --> 00:48:53,160
but I'm saying there's some fishy shit 
going on there.

1058
00:48:53,161 --> 00:48:54,210
Right?
Here's the fish.

1059
00:48:54,211 --> 00:48:56,070
Here's the thing,
for sure.

1060
00:48:56,190 --> 00:49:01,050
Someone that works for the government 
has had someone killed,

1061
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:02,520
right?
For sure.

1062
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:07,580
Let's just go.
Even Johnson was about to be indicted 

1063
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:10,350
for two murders before jfk got murdered,
but let's start from the beginning.

1064
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,350
It was that true?
Yes.

1065
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:12,170
I believe that.
Yeah.

1066
00:49:12,171 --> 00:49:14,220
And then let's start for somebody who 
becomes president.

1067
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:14,820
Boom.
It's gone.

1068
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:18,600
Let's start from the beginning for sure.
Someone,

1069
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:23,280
whether it was Nixon or whether it was 
Theodore Roosevelt or Kennedy,

1070
00:49:23,281 --> 00:49:27,420
someone at some point in time wanted 
someone dead.

1071
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:32,530
Yeah.
And they did it and then pulled it off 

1072
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:32,530
and the best way to do it's called a 
suicide.

1073
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:37,250
Right?
And make it look not like a suicide 

1074
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:37,250
because then you're sending a message.
They do it on purpose.

1075
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:41,600
Here's the question.
If we all agree and I think every 

1076
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,170
reasonable person would agree that 
somewhere in government somewhere,

1077
00:49:43,171 --> 00:49:46,440
at some point in time someone has 
ordered someone killed and got away with

1078
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:46,810
it.
Right?

1079
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:52,790
So that's what I'm saying.
Not so then the question is how many 

1080
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:52,790
other times?
Yeah.

1081
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,920
How often did you find that chick who 
recently got got a suicidal,

1082
00:49:58,410 --> 00:49:59,580
but hold on Eddie.
Here's the thing.

1083
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:01,800
You've got to think of military strikes,
right?

1084
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:03,870
If you're willing to authorize a 
military strike,

1085
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,580
you get to the point where you're 
willing to say,

1086
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:08,520
okay,
do it like especially a drone strike.

1087
00:50:08,521 --> 00:50:09,990
How about that?
Like this is the building,

1088
00:50:09,991 --> 00:50:14,991
the apartment building.
We're 97 percent sure he's in the 

1089
00:50:14,991 --> 00:50:17,841
building.
Do we have the authorization like how 

1090
00:50:17,841 --> 00:50:19,851
many civilians are dealing with 
somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 to 

1091
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:19,851
100?
Okay.

1092
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:20,310
Yeah,
my authorization and they do it and they

1093
00:50:20,311 --> 00:50:22,140
launched that.
Anytime you do that,

1094
00:50:22,141 --> 00:50:27,141
if you can do that,
if you can press that button and just 

1095
00:50:27,141 --> 00:50:27,560
wipe out 100 people,
including the guy.

1096
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:28,250
Anytime

1097
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,240
you can do that.
Well,

1098
00:50:29,241 --> 00:50:32,150
you just killed 100 people that didn't 
do anything wrong.

1099
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:37,510
Now,
how easy is it going to be to kill some 

1100
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:39,491
people that you think do a little bit 
wrong or annoying or keep fucking with 

1101
00:50:39,561 --> 00:50:41,430
you or like,
you know,

1102
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:43,460
the Michael Hastings story,
you know that story,

1103
00:50:43,461 --> 00:50:44,810
don't you?
Which ones that.

1104
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,480
Michael Hastings,
did he get circumcised?

1105
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,410
He was a journalist.
He commit suicide.

1106
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:54,010
Michael Hastings was a journalist who 
wrote for the rolling stone and he 

1107
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:55,820
followed around a general and he got 
stuck over there.

1108
00:50:56,150 --> 00:51:01,150
There was something happened.
I think it was that volcano that went 

1109
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:01,150
off,
wasn't it?

1110
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:02,240
Were they limited air travel for like a 
month?

1111
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:07,540
Anyway,
he got stuck over there while the 

1112
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:07,760
volcanoes,
they couldn't fly into this shit because

1113
00:51:07,761 --> 00:51:11,050
if the sky was hazy around this area,
um,

1114
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,770
so he stuck around and they,
you know,

1115
00:51:12,771 --> 00:51:17,771
they got a little loose with them,
they joking around about stuff and he 

1116
00:51:17,771 --> 00:51:21,881
was making jokes about Obama and the 
rolling stone reported it and he wound 

1117
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:23,660
up getting retired.

1118
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:28,930
He retired and stepped down.
He had to sort of step down because he 

1119
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:30,920
was in insane.
And after he did that,

1120
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,110
like everybody was furious since this 
report,

1121
00:51:33,111 --> 00:51:38,111
he got a shitload of death threats 
because this guy was a serious general 

1122
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,950
and he really knew his shit and he was 
well respected amongst its troops and he

1123
00:51:39,951 --> 00:51:44,951
had a step down and he had it put those 
people in danger because this guy had an

1124
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:51,070
inside track to these people and they 
got a little comfortable around him and 

1125
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:54,641
they took this one part and put it in.
This article made this big story about 

1126
00:51:54,641 --> 00:51:54,641
it.
Well,

1127
00:51:54,641 --> 00:51:57,440
he wound up driving his car into a tree 
like 120 miles an hour.

1128
00:51:58,070 --> 00:51:59,900
I went and pulled that out of the car,
explode.

1129
00:51:59,901 --> 00:52:01,460
It's new cars,
new cars.

1130
00:52:01,461 --> 00:52:06,461
Apparently they can take over the car.
The car exploded and the engine was 

1131
00:52:06,461 --> 00:52:10,470
launched from the vehicle,
like the engine blew up and was on the.

1132
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,860
I forget how far away it was from the 
car.

1133
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:13,550
Fishy,
right?

1134
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:15,110
Oh,
so crazy fishing.

1135
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:20,320
But who knows?
They said this is what the thing they 

1136
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:20,320
said.
They said,

1137
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,170
oh,
well he had amphetamines in his system.

1138
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:26,560
Well,
you know why he had amphetamines in a 

1139
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:26,560
system?
Because he's a fucking writer.

1140
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,620
Here's the dirty secret about writers.
They're all on adderall.

1141
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,300
You guys a shit ton of.
I'm on adderall.

1142
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:34,580
Like if someone's a writer and you've 
got deadlines,

1143
00:52:34,581 --> 00:52:37,670
you've got to be like alert.
It's way too easy.

1144
00:52:37,671 --> 00:52:42,671
I have a good friend who told me that 
almost all journalists and writers are 

1145
00:52:43,011 --> 00:52:45,290
taking this stuff when they need it.
Is that helps,

1146
00:52:45,291 --> 00:52:46,310
right?
It helps.

1147
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:51,400
It absolutely helps put.
So there's the crash and there's the 

1148
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,821
engine.
If fucking launched a block away and 

1149
00:52:54,821 --> 00:52:58,280
they think that the conspiracy theory is
that they drove him,

1150
00:52:58,281 --> 00:53:03,281
not only drove him into a tree,
would they set a bomb in his car and 

1151
00:53:03,281 --> 00:53:03,440
that it,
um,

1152
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:08,210
it slammed in the bomb,
exploded in the engine launch.

1153
00:53:08,211 --> 00:53:09,760
Look how far away the engineers look at 
the engine,

1154
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:14,780
the upper right hand corner.
There's the car and they'll look at the 

1155
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:14,870
engine way up there.
It launched.

1156
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:18,500
The whole thing is crazy.
So what my point was,

1157
00:53:18,501 --> 00:53:20,240
let me finish.
He fucked up his.

1158
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:25,810
Even if the conspiracy theory that every
now and then

1159
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,440
politician,
someone in power,

1160
00:53:28,441 --> 00:53:32,430
even maybe an entertainer has someone 
suicided because they're in the elite,

1161
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,290
they got all the connections and they 
can get away with it.

1162
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:37,740
Um,
even if that's not true,

1163
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:39,570
and that's all bullshit.
And,

1164
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:42,330
and every suicide generally as a 
suicide,

1165
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:46,890
even though it looks weird and then they
make it look like when you,

1166
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:48,030
when you watched that movie that,
uh,

1167
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:53,070
the documentary,
the Clinton chronicles on Youtube and 

1168
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:53,280
you watch that man,
man,

1169
00:53:53,281 --> 00:53:58,281
they,
they make it look obvious to send a 

1170
00:53:58,281 --> 00:53:58,281
message like,
listen,

1171
00:53:58,281 --> 00:54:00,930
we got the corner in our pocket.
You don't want to fuck with us.

1172
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:03,870
We can make anything happen and no one's
going to jail.

1173
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:06,870
That's what that is.
But that's the conspiracy theory.

1174
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:10,020
But if it's not a real,
damn,

1175
00:54:10,021 --> 00:54:11,820
that's a good idea.
You know what I mean?

1176
00:54:11,821 --> 00:54:14,310
Run with that shit.
That's a great idea.

1177
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:19,790
If you're,
if you're corrupt and you want to hold 

1178
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:22,611
onto your power and you want to climb up
as high as you can in the political 

1179
00:54:22,611 --> 00:54:24,030
world,
that's a great idea,

1180
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:26,700
right on the corner.
Go after the corner,

1181
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,710
whoever the,
wherever you're where you're a mayor,

1182
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:34,720
what we go after the corner.
You got to own them and then there's 

1183
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,240
evidence that you look at stuff,
certain cases,

1184
00:54:36,241 --> 00:54:40,260
and it's obvious for certain cases they 
fly in the corner,

1185
00:54:40,261 --> 00:54:41,220
they fly in.
It's,

1186
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:46,460
it's so shady,
but why wouldn't it be and why wouldn't 

1187
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:48,921
you believe it will,
you know what do you want the best one 

1188
00:54:48,921 --> 00:54:50,130
to Enron whistleblower who shot himself 
in the head.

1189
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:53,400
He shot himself in the head.
Exactly.

1190
00:54:53,401 --> 00:54:55,490
They do that on purpose.
That's an obvious one.

1191
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:58,710
If you were a detective,
would you enter a case like that?

1192
00:54:58,711 --> 00:54:59,160
Go,
listen,

1193
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,380
someone got suicided but it looks fishy.

1194
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,490
Would you say,
Nah,

1195
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,610
I'd suicide.
Don't disrespect the family.

1196
00:55:05,611 --> 00:55:07,260
Just keep it a suicide.
They told us it was.

1197
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:12,380
No,
you would want to know what the fuck 

1198
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,631
really happened.
Like if one of like one of your 

1199
00:55:14,631 --> 00:55:16,461
relatives died or whatever,
and they said she committed suicide and 

1200
00:55:16,461 --> 00:55:16,461
you're like,
fuck.

1201
00:55:16,461 --> 00:55:16,860
But then someone you know that knows 
him,

1202
00:55:16,861 --> 00:55:21,861
said it wasn't suicide brow it wouldn't 
you want to know the details or would 

1203
00:55:21,861 --> 00:55:24,420
you say it wasn't suicide?
That's what the COP said.

1204
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:29,630
You know,
what we should have respect for their 

1205
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:29,630
soul and their family.
We just say that.

1206
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:29,760
Or would you say,
tell me what the fuck happened.

1207
00:55:29,761 --> 00:55:30,960
What do you know?
Right,

1208
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:32,460
right.
That's natural.

1209
00:55:32,461 --> 00:55:35,760
If it's her family fuck out.
So when it comes to stuff like,

1210
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:37,230
um,
uh,

1211
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:39,720
uh,
you look at Chris Cornell,

1212
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,810
him and his wife had a foundation.
Him and Chester,

1213
00:55:42,811 --> 00:55:43,650
we're best friends.

1214
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,170
The conspiracy theory,
I don't know if it's true,

1215
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:48,750
but that we're gonna be found out some 
shit.

1216
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,910
They found out some shifts.
Let's be respectful.

1217
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:51,740
No,
we don't.

1218
00:55:51,741 --> 00:55:52,600
We don't know.
I don't know.

1219
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:56,010
I'm not naming any names,
but you got to look into it.

1220
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:58,260
But it's.
This guy just died,

1221
00:55:58,261 --> 00:56:00,190
man.
I just don't think this is shit.

1222
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:01,390
Do it on.
It's,

1223
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:06,740
that's why you should speculate it when 
you find out the connection and the way 

1224
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:08,670
they died it,
they made it.

1225
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:14,150
Chris Cornell had nine broken ribs and a
gash in the back of his head and hung 

1226
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:14,760
them.
Yes,

1227
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:17,370
and they said the official story is from
the CPR,

1228
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:23,330
the CPR.
He was already dead when they got there 

1229
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:23,330
and they break nine ribs,
don't CPI,

1230
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:24,010
and there's a gash behind his head 
behind his head

1231
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:29,010
when they cut them loose and he bangs 
his head off the ground and he's 

1232
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,210
hanging.
He's hanging off a like one of those 

1233
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:32,560
exercise.
Someone killed him.

1234
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:33,720
When?
When?

1235
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:35,890
When you look at the evidence,
you're like,

1236
00:56:35,891 --> 00:56:37,960
Holy Shit.
He looked like he was murdered.

1237
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:41,050
And then chester right before chester 
dies the same way,

1238
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:43,330
the exact same way.
Let's not do this man.

1239
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:46,250
I don't want to even do this.
Alright,

1240
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,480
okay.
I'm just looking into.

1241
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:51,250
Because I love Chester.
I love Chester.

1242
00:56:51,251 --> 00:56:53,470
I Love Lincoln Park,
Lincoln Park,

1243
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:57,430
Lincoln Park.
I don't understand the theories involved

1244
00:56:57,431 --> 00:56:59,410
in this guy's death,
especially when he just died.

1245
00:56:59,411 --> 00:57:03,060
It just seems so disrespectful.
And I.

1246
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:04,890
He was one of my favorite singers of all
time stand.

1247
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:09,900
But if you really did just kill himself,
like it seems so disrespectful to 

1248
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,950
speculate that he was murdered because 
of some conspiracy theory.

1249
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,100
I don't know what the case is,
but I don't even want to talk about it.

1250
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:19,300
But do you know what I'm saying?
That you know what I said enough.

1251
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:21,160
I don't need to say no more.
I don't want to get into trouble,

1252
00:57:21,161 --> 00:57:24,700
but I'm just okay.
I'm not trying to put anybody in jail.

1253
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,680
I'm just.
I Love Lincoln Park.

1254
00:57:26,681 --> 00:57:28,990
I love Chester.
I love Chris Cornell.

1255
00:57:28,991 --> 00:57:30,980
You can understand.
I understand.

1256
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:34,480
I just feel like you should really know 
what the fuck are you talking about when

1257
00:57:34,481 --> 00:57:36,930
you talk about people.
We were just talking about suicides.

1258
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:41,950
We were just talking about.
We were just talking about is when you 

1259
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:44,530
look at what they were into,
they were into that.

1260
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:46,750
They were into fighting that.
Okay.

1261
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,110
And when you look at exactly how also 
severely depressed,

1262
00:57:50,111 --> 00:57:52,270
there was also a lot of psychological 
shit going on.

1263
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:53,650
Yeah.
I don't know man.

1264
00:57:53,651 --> 00:57:55,330
I don't know why people kill themselves,
period,

1265
00:57:55,331 --> 00:57:56,230
you know?
I don't know why,

1266
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,290
but wouldn't you want to do serious?

1267
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,370
There was some fish.
Maybe I'll look into it.

1268
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:06,390
Talk about it until whatever the fuck 
reality has been that we were talking 

1269
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:12,151
about.
We're talking about all these crazy 

1270
00:58:12,151 --> 00:58:15,721
suicides.
We're talking about our that and then 

1271
00:58:15,721 --> 00:58:16,460
this is insane.
This is time.

1272
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:22,320
This is when you should bring it up.
Have not later when everyone forgets 

1273
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,140
about know any facts,
so when you're bringing it.

1274
00:58:23,141 --> 00:58:24,780
I'm just telling you.
Sounds crazy.

1275
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:26,110
Okay.
Alright.

1276
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:27,640
I get it.
I get it.

1277
00:58:27,641 --> 00:58:28,710
He was probably.
He was.

1278
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:32,800
He probably did it himself.
He could have very well easily have done

1279
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:37,801
it himself and the whole thing is just 
connecting them to some conspiracy 

1280
00:58:37,801 --> 00:58:41,911
without like a d because I care about it
because I care about a deep 

1281
00:58:41,911 --> 00:58:42,220
understanding of the.
I care about.

1282
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,350
I care about them.
You don't know how,

1283
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:45,820
how much,
how deep.

1284
00:58:45,821 --> 00:58:47,320
My understanding is.
I believe you.

1285
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:48,670
Dude.
You don't know how deep my understanding

1286
00:58:48,671 --> 00:58:53,671
is.
You have to assume that just make this 

1287
00:58:53,671 --> 00:58:53,671
happened.
No,

1288
00:58:53,671 --> 00:58:56,580
but I've looked into it.
What I assume you don't know who was 

1289
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:56,580
trying to kill them.
I assume you weren't there.

1290
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:58,530
I assume that you don't know it as a 
fact.

1291
00:58:58,531 --> 00:59:03,531
I was.
Trust me that I looked into it and you 

1292
00:59:03,531 --> 00:59:03,531
wear the shoe you have,
man.

1293
00:59:03,531 --> 00:59:03,531
I sure you have.
I just,

1294
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:07,090
it just me personally,
I feel very sensitive about that stuff.

1295
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:07,640
I get.
No,

1296
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,040
I get it.
I totally get it.

1297
00:59:09,041 --> 00:59:12,220
Let's change the subject.
Let's get into the UFC.

1298
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:13,820
Okay.
Damien Maia,

1299
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,310
can we turn the tie?
Rod Woodley,

1300
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:18,000
Tyron,
tyron tie rod,

1301
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:19,570
Tyron,
Tyron,

1302
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,550
tyron Woodley.
Yeah.

1303
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:21,700
That

1304
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:27,230
people thought that was a boring match,
but for me there were tremendous data in

1305
00:59:27,771 --> 00:59:31,550
mma.
The fact like Damon goes down to one 70,

1306
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:36,740
one 70 takes everybody down.
He's taking college wrestlers down left 

1307
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,920
and right,
but could he take down tyronn?

1308
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:42,560
I thought I probably.
I thought that was that he was gonna hit

1309
00:59:42,561 --> 00:59:44,270
a wall there and he did.
How are you going to take that?

1310
00:59:44,271 --> 00:59:45,800
Do down.
It's going to be very,

1311
00:59:45,801 --> 00:59:47,870
very hard to take him down,
so we learned.

1312
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,490
What I learned from that is,
man,

1313
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:54,640
you got to get really good at shooting 
and doing what Paul was an expert.

1314
00:59:55,820 --> 01:00:00,820
Paul says,
is the best ever I've ever seen an MMA 

1315
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:01,730
at making,
pulling guard option one,

1316
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:04,700
you just made it like not option three.
I was talking about the third option.

1317
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:08,150
I would want my fighter to have the best
standup possible,

1318
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,890
the best takedowns possible.

1319
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:12,650
Get on top,
grounded pound and submit them.

1320
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:14,570
Beat them on the feet of your beat,
on beating them,

1321
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:18,500
but if you're getting beat on the feet 
and you can't take the guy down,

1322
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:20,330
you better know how to pull guard you 
gotta.

1323
01:00:20,331 --> 01:00:23,300
You gotta know how to drag dudes down,
unorthodox ways,

1324
01:00:23,301 --> 01:00:24,710
not just the regular wrestling.
Why?

1325
01:00:24,711 --> 01:00:25,970
Because you're going to hit tie Rod 
Woodley,

1326
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:28,010
you gotta throw some flying in an artist
on him.

1327
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:33,160
You got to shoot deep enough just to get
a slight clench and have something 

1328
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:33,160
you're going to jump on.
Not with you,

1329
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,820
not continue with the traditional 
wrestling.

1330
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,770
You gotta shoot pool,
half guard,

1331
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,100
just like Andre Galvao did he when he 
fought mma a few times,

1332
01:00:40,101 --> 01:00:41,930
that's all he did is shoot.
Dude,

1333
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,560
sprawled.
You just pulled half guard below me.

1334
01:00:43,561 --> 01:00:45,200
Got Up double under hooks,
got the bag.

1335
01:00:45,730 --> 01:00:49,340
You got to get creative the way Nogueira
be 10 Sylvia,

1336
01:00:49,341 --> 01:00:50,480
way back in the day.

1337
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:53,600
Ten Sylvia could not get taken down.
It's too tall,

1338
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,160
Yada awesome.
Reach.

1339
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:58,010
Nogueira was getting clipped.
It couldn't take down.

1340
01:00:58,011 --> 01:00:58,540
Tim.
Sylvia,

1341
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:00,500
what did he do?
He shot the best he could.

1342
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:04,580
And when Tim Silvia countered,
he pulled half guard.

1343
01:01:04,581 --> 01:01:05,650
He ended up in,
in,

1344
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:06,040
in,
uh,

1345
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:09,760
in Deepak and boom with the momentum,
got up,

1346
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:11,900
swept him.
So it was an indirect,

1347
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:15,410
unorthodox take is what happened.
If you shoot pool guard and then sweep,

1348
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:17,480
that's the take down.
You end up in the same place.

1349
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:20,010
So he went around the,
the,

1350
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:21,170
the,
the wall,

1351
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:25,250
and he ended up guillotine him put a 
guillotine from the top.

1352
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:28,480
You got to have that.
You got to.

1353
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:30,560
And you know when he was pulling guard 
before Damien,

1354
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:35,561
Maia did pull guard before,
early in his career and he just wasn't 

1355
01:01:35,561 --> 01:01:36,500
having it and he didn't.
That wasn't an option.

1356
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:37,700
Tyrons takedown defense.

1357
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:40,400
That was,
that was the take down defense.

1358
01:01:40,401 --> 01:01:41,600
Yes.
That was the last option.

1359
01:01:41,601 --> 01:01:46,601
But this is not,
I'm not talking about traditional 

1360
01:01:46,601 --> 01:01:48,551
takedowns.
I'm talking about the art of watch Paul 

1361
01:01:48,551 --> 01:01:48,551
Sas.
He would totally,

1362
01:01:48,551 --> 01:01:52,730
there's a time you can't just sit on 
your butt and I think after talking to 

1363
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:55,720
take with a guy like tyron woodley is,
you're going to have to get a wrestler 

1364
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,751
who's like an elite high caliber 
wrestler that's going to be able to 

1365
01:01:58,751 --> 01:02:02,651
figure out how to take him down.
I don't think like a regular dude like 

1366
01:02:02,651 --> 01:02:04,280
Damien Maia who's not a regular dudes,
a world class grappler,

1367
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:06,970
but just here.
Dominick Cruz is criticism of his,

1368
01:02:06,971 --> 01:02:11,971
uh,
his takedown temps that he wasn't 

1369
01:02:11,971 --> 01:02:11,971
following through enough and what he was
saying technically was wrong.

1370
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,030
Yeah.
You know,

1371
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:18,850
I think that if it was a real world 
class grappler for a real,

1372
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:19,980
you know,
top of the

1373
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:24,980
food chain,
amateur wrestling had one taken 

1374
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:26,310
everybody down.
He is like the best wrestler.

1375
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:30,120
What he said about the fence,
because most of Damien Maia take downs,

1376
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:32,190
a lot of them anyways are against the 
fence.

1377
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:37,191
He's really good at going double under 
hooks and doing some inside trips or 

1378
01:02:37,191 --> 01:02:38,900
outside trips.
Tyron,

1379
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:39,670
defendant,
all that shit.

1380
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,040
But you know,
what else tyron did?

1381
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:44,040
He clipped him with a huge uppercut and 
the very first exchange,

1382
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:46,830
the very first time Damien tried to 
close the distance,

1383
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:50,010
tyron hit him with a vicious uppercut 
and he fucked his left eye up.

1384
01:02:50,011 --> 01:02:55,011
Damien's left.
I was fucked up from the very first 

1385
01:02:55,011 --> 01:02:57,141
exchange,
the Damien shot low tire and hit him 

1386
01:02:57,141 --> 01:02:58,920
with a heart uppercut and just as his,
I immediately swell up and it was fucked

1387
01:02:58,921 --> 01:03:03,921
for the rest of the fight.
So I think that that played a factor 

1388
01:03:03,921 --> 01:03:03,921
too.

1389
01:03:03,921 --> 01:03:06,870
Just tyrons game plan was in a lot of 
people's eyes,

1390
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:11,990
wasn't fun to watch.
That was the problem and like Dana felt 

1391
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:13,770
like he should have finished them.
And tyron his thought was,

1392
01:03:13,771 --> 01:03:15,000
look,
this is this guy's.

1393
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:20,250
It's his goal is to win the title.
You've got to come and try to beat me.

1394
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:22,590
And when the title,
if I'm beating you,

1395
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:27,950
why?
Why don't I just keep doing what I'm 

1396
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:27,950
doing and continue winning the fight.
You can't do anything,

1397
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:29,670
but if I changed tactics and make myself
more vulnerable.

1398
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:35,030
And he said he did get hit by a lefthand
or a couple left hands and that the 

1399
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:35,030
stunned them.
I guess his attitude was,

1400
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:36,780
look,
if this guy wants to win that title,

1401
01:03:36,781 --> 01:03:38,520
he's gotTa come and get it and it 
becomes get it.

1402
01:03:38,521 --> 01:03:40,980
I'm going to knock him the fuck out and 
if he doesn't come and get it,

1403
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:42,240
why would I?

1404
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,150
Why would I go after him and put myself 
out of position?

1405
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:47,220
I would coach Woodley the exact same 
lane.

1406
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:49,770
I would be yelling from the corner.
Just keep doing what you're doing.

1407
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:54,580
Don't one fucked up exchange,
gets a shot in and take some trips.

1408
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:56,700
Him.
He tries to get up on his knees,

1409
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:59,130
jumps on his back,
and that little scramble.

1410
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,320
One little scramble like that.
Boom,

1411
01:04:01,321 --> 01:04:06,321
you just fucked your whole shit up.
Damien is not the best punch her in the 

1412
01:04:06,321 --> 01:04:06,780
world,
but he's not the worst either.

1413
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:10,500
He can fuck you up if you.
If you make a mistake and if you rush in

1414
01:04:10,501 --> 01:04:15,501
and maybe he's reserved more energy than
you think he has and he fires a very 

1415
01:04:15,501 --> 01:04:16,470
fast rate lefthand and catches you on 
the chin.

1416
01:04:16,471 --> 01:04:18,630
He could fuck you up.
He can fuck anybody up.

1417
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,700
He's not incompetent on the feet.

1418
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:22,980
He's just not at the same level as 
tyron.

1419
01:04:23,050 --> 01:04:24,750
He doesn't have the same movement.
It's tire.

1420
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:29,830
Do you think Damien should would have.
Damien had kicks a more like maybe not 

1421
01:04:29,830 --> 01:04:34,821
exactly like,
but more in the vein of Edson Barboza 

1422
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:40,460
Rodriguez.
Wouldn't that be a whole nother 

1423
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:40,460
dimension?
Blake doesn't even have to be like that.

1424
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:41,280
How about just like Pedro his Oh,
just attack the legs.

1425
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,110
Just make,
make the legs.

1426
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,300
He's not doing that right now.
Very little boxing.

1427
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:50,450
Well,
dominick brought it up one time during 

1428
01:04:50,450 --> 01:04:50,450
the broadcast because he's like,
I want to see Damien throw high kick,

1429
01:04:50,450 --> 01:04:51,030
a left high kick.
I go,

1430
01:04:51,031 --> 01:04:51,660
yeah,
but I go,

1431
01:04:51,661 --> 01:04:53,820
have you ever seen Damian throw a left 
high kick?

1432
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,150
And he's like,
I don't know.

1433
01:04:55,290 --> 01:04:56,820
I'm like,
I don't know either.

1434
01:04:56,821 --> 01:04:58,170
I don't know if he's ever done it.
I'm not,

1435
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:03,360
I'm not disagreeing with you,
but I'm saying I don't think I've ever 

1436
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:03,360
seen him try it.

1437
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:07,010
Like he doesn't.
I think he's such a specialist and his 

1438
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:07,400
specialty is just get you to the ground 
strangling.

1439
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:09,630
He should spend grounds.
I would suggest.

1440
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:10,590
I don't know.
I ain't shit,

1441
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:15,420
but I would like to see Damien Maia with
some with a adding to his arsenal,

1442
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:17,950
adding kicks,
adding more whiteboards like why not for

1443
01:05:17,951 --> 01:05:19,720
sure,
but even if he did,

1444
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:25,080
the problem is it's like tyron is just 
so fucking strong and so good at stuff 

1445
01:05:25,951 --> 01:05:28,300
and takedowns any hits,
so God damn hard.

1446
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:33,600
It's like you'd have to be like on him 
and you got to figure out how to 

1447
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:37,081
actually get him to the ground,
have full control of him and good luck 

1448
01:05:37,081 --> 01:05:37,081
with all that.

1449
01:05:37,081 --> 01:05:39,440
Remember Nogueira versus Mark Coleman?
Yeah.

1450
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:44,490
That that Mark Coleman was planning on 
going to the ground with a Nogueira at 

1451
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:46,010
all.
This was at the height of pride.

1452
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:51,470
Mark Coleman's plan was to box with him,
use his wrestling to not go to the 

1453
01:05:52,371 --> 01:05:55,820
ground.
That was the plan the whole way through.

1454
01:05:56,030 --> 01:05:59,000
I'm going to box this Nogueira guy.
He's got an amazing guard,

1455
01:05:59,450 --> 01:06:01,910
amazing Jujitsu,
and he ain't going to take me down.

1456
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,340
I fucking wrestled the Columbus.
What happened?

1457
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:05,960
Didn't know Garrett.
Take them down.

1458
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:08,090
Fuck no,
he didn't know what he did.

1459
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:11,990
He's like,
people who can throw high kicks in,

1460
01:06:11,991 --> 01:06:16,991
a lot of head kicks usually don't 
because they're afraid of going to the 

1461
01:06:16,991 --> 01:06:16,991
ground.
All the guys that could do that,

1462
01:06:16,991 --> 01:06:21,281
but guys that want to be on the ground 
and don't mind being on their back and 

1463
01:06:21,281 --> 01:06:24,821
are dangerous off the back and are known
for having a dangerous guard like 

1464
01:06:24,821 --> 01:06:25,520
Nogueira.
They could throw all the high kicks they

1465
01:06:25,521 --> 01:06:27,710
want and that's exactly what know Kara 
did.

1466
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:30,050
He started throwing high kicks whizzing 
by,

1467
01:06:30,051 --> 01:06:34,400
Mr Coleman's had and then one just 
barely nipped his forehead.

1468
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:36,880
So Mark Coleman just snapped into 
wrestling,

1469
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,990
said,
fuck these baseball bats.

1470
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:41,020
I'm going to ground and pound this 
motherfucker.

1471
01:06:41,090 --> 01:06:44,540
Take my chances in his garden.
He took him down.

1472
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:45,590
He got triangle.

1473
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:47,910
Yeah.
That was the glory days of Jujitsu.

1474
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:53,280
Heavyweight champion.
It was a triangle arm bar.

1475
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:56,310
And that you were out to exactly how I 
felt back then.

1476
01:06:57,140 --> 01:07:02,140
Yeah,
that's how we got to fight to the 

1477
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:04,341
ground.
It's by throwing head kicks and scaring 

1478
01:07:04,341 --> 01:07:05,020
the motherfucker wrestling.
You know,

1479
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:06,570
cowboy.
He used to do that a lot.

1480
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:11,220
Cowboy has a nasty guard and one of the 
reasons why guard is,

1481
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:13,590
I mean one of the reasons why so loose 
with his kicks,

1482
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,060
because he doesn't mind if you take them
down,

1483
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:16,880
if you take them down,
he tie shit up quick.

1484
01:07:16,881 --> 01:07:17,340
Yeah,
exactly.

1485
01:07:17,341 --> 01:07:20,790
That's what they need.
Mondelez throw his head kicks head kicks

1486
01:07:20,791 --> 01:07:23,510
all the time because he hits guard is 
super dangerous.

1487
01:07:23,511 --> 01:07:28,511
His gardens to jump in his garden,
there's like 40 slash 50 percent chance 

1488
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:29,080
you're going to tap.
Yeah.

1489
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:31,220
His gardens saying yeah,
he just a.

1490
01:07:31,350 --> 01:07:34,830
He did an Ebi maybe like eight months 
ago.

1491
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:37,950
He pulled off some beautiful rubber 
guard man.

1492
01:07:37,951 --> 01:07:39,570
He looked like a fucking Ninja.

1493
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:45,320
Yeah,
he's a bad motherfucker and he's a bad 

1494
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,360
motherfucker.
He's got a crazy athletic frame too,

1495
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:47,550
you know,
he's like,

1496
01:07:47,551 --> 01:07:52,551
he's.
He's built like this gigantic superhero 

1497
01:07:52,551 --> 01:07:52,551
type character.
He's a cute dude.

1498
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:56,220
Built like a big small dude and he's all
handsome and shit.

1499
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:58,380
He's right up there with Alan jobe.
Beautiful Man.

1500
01:07:58,381 --> 01:08:00,120
He's right there.
I would put them right there,

1501
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:03,540
but don't you think like when you look 
at his proportions and the way he moves,

1502
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:04,980
he's almost like a,
you know,

1503
01:08:04,981 --> 01:08:08,160
a lot of big guys.
Like they look like big guys.

1504
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,620
You know what I'm saying?
Like a,

1505
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:12,650
like a perfect example would be like 
that.

1506
01:08:12,651 --> 01:08:16,460
Do that just submitted Travis Browne.
Was it only neck?

1507
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:21,490
Is that how you say it?
The guy that got that done just 

1508
01:08:21,490 --> 01:08:21,490
submitted.
Travis Brockie.

1509
01:08:21,490 --> 01:08:23,300
No,
choke off his bass off his back.

1510
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:25,040
That guy,
he just be transparent.

1511
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:25,670
Did He,
what?

1512
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:30,670
Did he get them in arm?
Trying to get them in like a rear naked 

1513
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:30,670
choke on the side.
Oh,

1514
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:30,670
that's right.
He does crazy.

1515
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:33,560
His squeeze must be insane.
Oh,

1516
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:39,670
he's probably just known in this gym is 
like did he's going to help get a hold 

1517
01:08:39,670 --> 01:08:39,800
of your neck and just smash it to.
He's a,

1518
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:44,830
he's a spooky good grappler.
You'd see like when he gets a hold of 

1519
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:48,010
guys that he's putting like a crusher 
squeeze on for the people don't 

1520
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:50,750
understand what he did.
He let a guy mount him and he choked the

1521
01:08:50,751 --> 01:08:55,280
guy while the guy was on top of them.
That is insane and unheard of.

1522
01:08:55,310 --> 01:09:00,310
He was mounted who was mounted,
which means it's one of the worst 

1523
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:01,160
positions you could ever be in an mma.
The guys on top of you,

1524
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:06,170
he's his hips are above your hips.
He's pinning you to the ground and this 

1525
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:06,380
guy choked the guy from the bottom.

1526
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:08,600
It never happens.
It never happens.

1527
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:11,110
The fact that he could do it,
I mean,

1528
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,550
here we can see it here.
What,

1529
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,210
what,
how do you spell,

1530
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:15,670
how do you say his name is?
Wassily.

1531
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,730
Alexi.
Alexi,

1532
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:21,890
Alexi Olynyk.
So he's just ragdoll and travis here and

1533
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:25,100
he gets his back and look at this.
He's got a rear naked on the side with a

1534
01:09:25,101 --> 01:09:30,101
body scissors.
Look how he's squeezing the body and 

1535
01:09:30,101 --> 01:09:30,700
just smush them so he can't breathe.
He's got them in a locked down.

1536
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:32,030
Across the body.
Yeah.

1537
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:33,890
And then he gets the neck and he's under
inac.

1538
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:36,980
Just sort of like a sideways rear naked 
choke.

1539
01:09:37,610 --> 01:09:41,030
The other one he did is even crazier 
when you see him submit.

1540
01:09:41,031 --> 01:09:43,340
The guy from the bottom with a mesial 
choke.

1541
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,710
See that kind of guy that looks like a 
big guy.

1542
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:47,810
You know what it looks like?
A big guy.

1543
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:49,840
Vinny Magallanes looks like a 
welterweight.

1544
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:51,850
That's six foot three for some strange 
reason.

1545
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:56,530
Two hundred and 30 pounds.
Is He fighting MMA anymore?

1546
01:09:56,531 --> 01:09:58,670
They just going to do Jujitsu.
I'm not sure.

1547
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:03,850
I'm not sure.
He's going to come back and do the 

1548
01:10:03,850 --> 01:10:04,060
absolute Ebi absolutes going to be a at 
on it.

1549
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:06,260
This shit.
Look at this shit.

1550
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:08,330
This is crazy.
Who fucked does that?

1551
01:10:08,690 --> 01:10:13,690
Watch them do that again.
That's ever done that back that up 

1552
01:10:13,690 --> 01:10:13,690
again.
People are going to try it now.

1553
01:10:13,690 --> 01:10:17,620
So going all the way to the beginning so
the guy gets mount and he.

1554
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:24,220
He thinks he's got to go.
I got them out here and he just sinks 

1555
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,700
this in and look how tidy makes this 
choke into the.

1556
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:27,960
Into the throat.
We're crazy,

1557
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:28,940
dude.
That seems legit.

1558
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:30,190
Fuck yeah,
it's legit.

1559
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,770
It's 100 percent legit,
I think.

1560
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:33,140
I think that's super legit.

1561
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:38,140
Yeah.
If you look at the way the arms are 

1562
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:38,140
folding up here,
I mean,

1563
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:38,140
that's not a goon,
right?

1564
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:41,900
That's a front naked truck yet is that 
is.

1565
01:10:41,901 --> 01:10:43,760
Um,
it's all like real leverage.

1566
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:48,850
You know,
how you could tell if a guy goon 

1567
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:49,670
somebody just crushing their head.
That's not a good squeeze right there.

1568
01:10:49,671 --> 01:10:50,460
Yeah.
And it's,

1569
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,780
it's fitting in like a like keys,
right?

1570
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,850
Yeah.
It's fitting in there perfectly.

1571
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:59,860
Your squeeze has to be super high level 
to get it to choke someone while being 

1572
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:00,830
mounted.
Oh good Lord.

1573
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:02,870
Good Lord.
How many people have that?

1574
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:08,660
See,
this tyron woodley thing is very tricky 

1575
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:11,621
because in my mind,
like I see that he wanted to win the 

1576
01:11:11,621 --> 01:11:13,560
fight period.
That is the best way to win the fight.

1577
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:18,830
If this guy is only offering a certain 
amount of offense and you could stuff 

1578
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:20,520
that offense and land your shots and 
continue to pile up points,

1579
01:11:20,521 --> 01:11:23,010
which he did and don't ever put yourself
at risk.

1580
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:28,280
I get it.
But I also get the Dana white point of 

1581
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:28,280
view where he's like,
you got to sell tickets.

1582
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:31,470
Like people are paying to see you fight.
And if people are holding up cell phones

1583
01:11:31,471 --> 01:11:33,180
and swinging them through the rafters,
you know,

1584
01:11:33,181 --> 01:11:35,760
because everybody's bored because they 
don't want to watch it anymore.

1585
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,580
And his,
his thought is like,

1586
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:39,150
you got to sell tickets.
Hey,

1587
01:11:39,151 --> 01:11:42,360
who's the greatest take down artists in 
UFC history?

1588
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:44,940
George St Pierre to her same po versus 
Woodley.

1589
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:50,510
Yeah,
but Woodley apparently because of this 

1590
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:54,921
fight,
they're talking about GSP versus 

1591
01:11:54,921 --> 01:11:54,921
bisping.
Oh,

1592
01:11:54,921 --> 01:11:55,210
they got to go to woodland.
Come on.

1593
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,630
That's the only guy.
If GSP just take woodley down,

1594
01:11:57,631 --> 01:11:59,640
nobody can.
But what if they just tried to take each

1595
01:11:59,641 --> 01:12:04,641
other down,
back and forth and everybody went crazy 

1596
01:12:04,641 --> 01:12:04,641
again.
Took him down repeatedly.

1597
01:12:04,641 --> 01:12:06,720
If he didn't like he would,
that'd be great too.

1598
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,310
But what if he did?
Either way,

1599
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:11,920
I want to see the fight because.
Because,

1600
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:15,780
because Woodley has a style.
Some people don't like it,

1601
01:12:15,781 --> 01:12:18,360
some people like it,
some people appreciate it or whatever.

1602
01:12:18,361 --> 01:12:22,320
But the only guy that has a shot to beat
Woodley,

1603
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:27,030
the only guy would be the best takedown,
best mma takedown artists of all time.

1604
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,490
He has like a million takedowns in the 
UFC.

1605
01:12:29,730 --> 01:12:32,370
He's the only guy that would be able to.
If GSP can do it,

1606
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:36,870
no one can.
He's also very good striker.

1607
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:40,530
I think kicks.
This is what you'd have GSP saying.

1608
01:12:40,730 --> 01:12:42,330
You got to go to the pro wrestling 
angle.

1609
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:47,660
You know,
I am tired of sitting at home watching 

1610
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:50,721
boring fights as bad gsp impression on 
him saying like,

1611
01:12:50,941 --> 01:12:52,480
enough already.
I want my sound.

1612
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,640
It sound like Arnold.
Kenny made ivs.

1613
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:58,280
Um,
I don't know.

1614
01:12:58,790 --> 01:12:59,850
Bisping's at one 95.

1615
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:01,110
That's kind of weird.
Is he saying,

1616
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:02,760
man,
it's going to be too hard to make one 70

1617
01:13:02,761 --> 01:13:07,761
without the ivs.
I think he was willing to fight either 

1618
01:13:07,761 --> 01:13:09,831
fight.
I think he was willing to do one 70 or 

1619
01:13:09,831 --> 01:13:09,831
one add woodley.
GSP would be huge.

1620
01:13:09,831 --> 01:13:11,720
That would.
That would be the biggest fight for.

1621
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:16,880
I'm not impressed with because who else 
is there at one 70 that has a chance of 

1622
01:13:18,601 --> 01:13:19,680
taking him down.
Well,

1623
01:13:19,681 --> 01:13:21,450
Robbie lawler,
since he just won,

1624
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:24,070
you would have to look at Robbie's 
contenders,

1625
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:29,180
so he would just brawl with him.
He's willing to brawl with them if you 

1626
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:30,640
can avoid the big bomb,
but he got hit with in the first fight,

1627
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:36,410
you know,
and you gotta think Robbie lawler is 

1628
01:13:36,410 --> 01:13:37,410
coming off of five round war with Rory 
Macdonald,

1629
01:13:37,411 --> 01:13:42,411
five round war with Carlos Condit,
war with Johny Hendricks war war,

1630
01:13:43,171 --> 01:13:44,010
war,
war.

1631
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,000
It's all war.

1632
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,130
Every fight.
He's in his war.

1633
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:52,490
So like I think the him having a year 
off was giant and then he fought cowboy 

1634
01:13:53,341 --> 01:13:55,380
and towards the end he was coming after 
cowboy.

1635
01:13:55,381 --> 01:13:58,710
He was hurting cowboy to the body.
He hit Cabo with some big shots.

1636
01:13:58,711 --> 01:14:01,110
I felt like a lot of people disagree 
with that decision,

1637
01:14:01,111 --> 01:14:06,111
but I felt like I give Robbie the first 
round because he jumped all over cowboy 

1638
01:14:06,111 --> 01:14:07,860
in the beginning it was,
I think it was enough to win the round,

1639
01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:11,040
although I think Cabo is getting the 
better of the exchanges,

1640
01:14:11,290 --> 01:14:16,290
the NFL silting the volume of and,
and the impact when to Robbie second 

1641
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:16,870
round when to cowboy.
Pretty big.

1642
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:20,620
But then Robbie rallied and the third 
round and I think he dominated the third

1643
01:14:20,621 --> 01:14:22,570
round and I think you hurt cowboy a few 
times.

1644
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:25,240
I think that would have been an amazing 
five round fight.

1645
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:27,430
That would have been an incredible.
Remember who won the fight?

1646
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:29,320
Robbie?
One very close decision.

1647
01:14:29,321 --> 01:14:31,740
I think it was a split decision.
I don't know.

1648
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:35,290
My grade five bring a scrambled.
It was a great fight.

1649
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,970
It was a great fight.
Both gave.

1650
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,020
Both took.
It was,

1651
01:14:38,021 --> 01:14:39,460
it was war.
It was chaos,

1652
01:14:39,690 --> 01:14:44,690
you know,
and in cowboy definitely caught them 

1653
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:44,690
with some clean shots.
He hit him some real good.

1654
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:45,220
Nice.
The body as well.

1655
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:47,530
Cowboy landed a lot of great shit.
But you know,

1656
01:14:47,531 --> 01:14:52,531
Robbie looked like Robbie again.
He looked like the Robbie lawler that 

1657
01:14:52,531 --> 01:14:52,531
won the title.
It looks like a killer.

1658
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:57,570
He looked like the same spooky dude that
just keeps coming after you until he 

1659
01:14:57,570 --> 01:15:00,871
puts you away.
That's what he looked like in the third 

1660
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:00,871
round.
Third round,

1661
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:01,630
particular really looked like he was 
falling back into the old groove again.

1662
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,070
So there's him.

1663
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:05,050
You know,
man,

1664
01:15:05,410 --> 01:15:10,410
it's crazy.
Seeing Rory Macdonald over in beltour 

1665
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:11,080
looking better than ever,
looking better than ever.

1666
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:13,730
When he took down Paul daily,
like he,

1667
01:15:13,731 --> 01:15:16,090
he cracked Paul on the feet,
didn't get hit with shit.

1668
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:18,250
Took Paul down and strangled the shit 
out of him.

1669
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:19,910
And the way he did it,
you watch it,

1670
01:15:19,911 --> 01:15:20,770
you go,
whoa.

1671
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:24,070
Like Rory Macdonald might be the best 
welterweight on the planet.

1672
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,330
Like he might,
he might write,

1673
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:26,290
be there,
you know,

1674
01:15:26,291 --> 01:15:28,180
you've got to remember he beat Tyron 
Woodley.

1675
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:30,070
Remember that fight?
I don't remember.

1676
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:31,000
Roy.
Shut him down.

1677
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:34,420
Shut down that big overhand right 
compressed against the cage.

1678
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:37,480
Not that long ago.
Maybe if I had a gas.

1679
01:15:37,481 --> 01:15:42,481
Two Thousand 15.
I think he fought tyron woodley before 

1680
01:15:42,481 --> 01:15:46,021
he fought Robbie lawler.
I think it was one of those elimination 

1681
01:15:46,021 --> 01:15:46,021
was that was a decision.
Yeah,

1682
01:15:46,021 --> 01:15:50,521
it'd be really by decision and the also 
be Damien Maia and he survived being 

1683
01:15:50,521 --> 01:15:50,680
mounted by Damien mine in the first 
round.

1684
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:54,520
Damien took him down mouth to them.
He defended and then he fucked Damien up

1685
01:15:54,521 --> 01:15:58,210
and the second and third rounds and he's
still peaking duties like 26.

1686
01:15:58,810 --> 01:16:00,910
He's one of the best in the world.
Without a doubt.

1687
01:16:00,911 --> 01:16:03,150
He might be the best without a doubt.
Yeah.

1688
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:05,210
It bums me out seeing him over at Bella 
Tor.

1689
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:09,130
I think that kid is sensational.
Is Kelvin coming back down to one 70?

1690
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:12,520
What do you think?
I think he can make it for sure.

1691
01:16:12,521 --> 01:16:15,250
I think if Calvin had the kind of 
discipline that Chris Weidman has to get

1692
01:16:15,251 --> 01:16:18,160
down to 85.
Chris Weidman's a huge guy.

1693
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:22,060
He has to have real discipline to make 
that 185 pound limit.

1694
01:16:22,061 --> 01:16:24,640
I mean he has to really watch his 
calories because you walk around it.

1695
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:27,880
I would like to know it's well north of 
200 pounds,

1696
01:16:27,881 --> 01:16:29,470
so he's a big guy,
you know,

1697
01:16:29,471 --> 01:16:32,590
according to Ray Longo,
Matt Serra that like Chris is on the big

1698
01:16:32,591 --> 01:16:37,591
side of 85,
like he could easily be on the small 

1699
01:16:37,591 --> 01:16:37,690
side of 205,
you know?

1700
01:16:37,690 --> 01:16:39,550
And then do you,
what do you think about these new weight

1701
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:41,350
class?
It was like the athletic commissions.

1702
01:16:41,351 --> 01:16:43,660
Now they're,
they're going to add 65,

1703
01:16:43,661 --> 01:16:48,661
75,
95 and I think to 20 to 25 to the UFC 

1704
01:16:48,671 --> 01:16:53,671
going to do this.
I don't know if the use is going to do 

1705
01:16:53,671 --> 01:16:53,671
it,
but I think they should.

1706
01:16:53,671 --> 01:16:54,520
I think they should go every 10 pounds.
Not every five pounds,

1707
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:56,950
but every 10 pounds like it the way it 
is.

1708
01:16:57,010 --> 01:16:59,850
Do you feel like it just.
It makes sense every.

1709
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:03,230
It makes sense,
but they don't need to or something.

1710
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:05,500
I don't think we need it.
It makes sense.

1711
01:17:05,501 --> 01:17:08,230
I don't mind the big jumps really find 
your spot.

1712
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:09,800
We don't need more.
It'll just be.

1713
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:11,030
It'll just.
I don't know.

1714
01:17:11,031 --> 01:17:13,370
At this point,
I think you keep it the way it is,

1715
01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:15,650
but who knows what they're going to do?

1716
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:18,350
I don't agree.
I think we need more weight classes.

1717
01:17:18,351 --> 01:17:22,790
I think there's two big jumps.
I think the jump of like one 85 to two.

1718
01:17:22,791 --> 01:17:24,260
Oh five.
It's fucking crazy.

1719
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:26,180
As a 20 pound jump.
That's huge.

1720
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:28,760
The difference between a guy who's 85 
and the guy was two,

1721
01:17:28,761 --> 01:17:30,080
oh,
five is significant.

1722
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:32,860
The amount of power that guy has over 
the 85 pounders.

1723
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:35,120
Fucking huge.
Trying to spot 55.

1724
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:40,210
It's too many.
There's too many tweeners like Diego 

1725
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:42,970
Sanchez.
Diego Sanchez is probably a 65 or you 

1726
01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:42,970
know,
maybe a little too small for 70.

1727
01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:44,570
Maybe too big for 55.
I think there's a few of those guys.

1728
01:17:44,571 --> 01:17:46,280
He's gotten down to 45.
I know.

1729
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:48,310
Not good though.
I mean not.

1730
01:17:48,370 --> 01:17:50,910
Not fought like to Diego Sanchez of old.
I don't know.

1731
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,340
I think it should sustain them.
It's 55 is spot.

1732
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:58,380
Yeah.
I think it's hard for him to even make 

1733
01:17:58,380 --> 01:17:58,380
that though.

1734
01:17:58,380 --> 01:17:58,700
If you could let them fight at 65,
he'd have all his energy.

1735
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:00,770
It makes sense what you're saying.
Like get.

1736
01:18:00,771 --> 01:18:03,680
It totally makes sense.
But the fighting,

1737
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:04,850
it's just fighting,
you know,

1738
01:18:04,851 --> 01:18:07,190
let's not diluted we got enough.
We need more.

1739
01:18:07,191 --> 01:18:12,191
We don't have everything.
Doesn't have to be like just all 

1740
01:18:12,191 --> 01:18:12,191
systematically.
Fair.

1741
01:18:12,191 --> 01:18:12,191
You know,
just think that's the case.

1742
01:18:12,191 --> 01:18:16,661
I don't think we have enough.
I think we get a room for more 

1743
01:18:16,661 --> 01:18:16,661
champions.
I think we'd have more super fights.

1744
01:18:16,661 --> 01:18:21,580
We'd have more guys rise to the top of 
the division and it will be easier to 

1745
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:22,310
match them up.
It's way easier to match up a 75 with an

1746
01:18:22,311 --> 01:18:26,660
85 than it is to match up a 70 with an 
85 or 55 with an 85.

1747
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:30,680
It's just like the gaps are too big.
I think we have too much already.

1748
01:18:30,990 --> 01:18:33,770
I think it's hard to keep track of shit 
the way it is.

1749
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:37,160
Maybe there's an argument for that,
I guess.

1750
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:38,660
I don't know.
I like it though.

1751
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:41,180
I think it gives people more options.
I think heavyweights,

1752
01:18:41,210 --> 01:18:43,400
for sure.
It gives them more options.

1753
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:45,500
I would also like to see a super 
heavyweight division.

1754
01:18:45,501 --> 01:18:47,120
I would like to see a full on freak 
show.

1755
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,550
I want to see the mountain from game of 
thrones.

1756
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,140
I want to see that guy learn how to 
fight.

1757
01:18:51,530 --> 01:18:56,530
He's like 330 fucking pounds.
You know that guy that picks up those 

1758
01:18:56,530 --> 01:18:57,410
stone balls and shit.
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1759
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,840
Carries cars.
He's one of those dudes.

1760
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:01,520
How big is he,
John?

1761
01:19:01,521 --> 01:19:02,390
Yeah.
How tall is he?

1762
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:03,050
Six.
Eight.

1763
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:04,250
Something like that.
Yeah.

1764
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:06,380
Viking,
straight viking long hair.

1765
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:07,260
Beard.
No.

1766
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,410
He's got a beard.
He's like one of those Iceland guys,

1767
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:11,300
I think Sweden or Iceland.
One of them.

1768
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:14,030
One of them Viking characters.
How big is that mountain dude?

1769
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:16,670
There's a video of him sparring with 
conor Mcgregor.

1770
01:19:16,671 --> 01:19:18,380
It's hilarious.
He's six foot nine.

1771
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:23,440
Jesus Christ.
What in the fuck is that?

1772
01:19:23,441 --> 01:19:25,480
Is there a picture of him?
Jesus Christ,

1773
01:19:26,530 --> 01:19:27,850
he weighs 300.
Eighty pounds.

1774
01:19:27,851 --> 01:19:30,430
Three hundred 86 with him picking up 
cars.

1775
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:31,710
Oh yeah,
there's,

1776
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:36,740
there's,
there's a bunch of videos of him doing 

1777
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:36,740
shit here.
Watch him.

1778
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:40,870
That's him.
See if they have some videos of him 

1779
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:42,820
doing his workouts.
His workouts are fucking insane or in in

1780
01:19:43,090 --> 01:19:45,700
some sort of strong man competition.
Do you ever see.

1781
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:47,800
Go back.
Go back to the screen you just had.

1782
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:53,200
See,
scroll down to that conor mcgregor 

1783
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:53,200
video.
The screen you just had.

1784
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:58,710
That's it right there.
See conor mcgregor versus the mountain 

1785
01:19:58,780 --> 01:20:02,410
and cottage playing around with them.
Sparring with a look at the size of this

1786
01:20:02,411 --> 01:20:06,540
guy and counties like slapping him in 
the stomach.

1787
01:20:10,290 --> 01:20:11,100
He's like,
come on,

1788
01:20:11,101 --> 01:20:14,710
I'm going to grab you think he's trying 
to grab him.

1789
01:20:17,630 --> 01:20:20,820
Oh,
look at this.

1790
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:24,800
He's like,
come on man.

1791
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:26,400
High Five.
Yeah,

1792
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:28,640
he's getting tired.
He's getting tired.

1793
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:30,650
Damn.
Kind of wanted to keep going.

1794
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:33,890
He's pulling him in the stomach.
Got a mad mad.

1795
01:20:35,470 --> 01:20:36,560
This is real now.
Yeah.

1796
01:20:36,561 --> 01:20:37,460
Yeah.
It's getting real.

1797
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:40,160
How old is this?
It's pretty recent.

1798
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:45,360
Like before he fought Aldo.
Damn.

1799
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:48,480
Look at this guy.
He's just kidding.

1800
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:50,810
I do with straight left face.
He's mad.

1801
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:52,190
He's mad.
Dude.

1802
01:20:53,660 --> 01:20:56,100
This is why conor mcgregor is such a bad
motherfucker.

1803
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,370
He's so.
He's so crazy.

1804
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,980
Like legitimately crazy.
They just like Bruce Lee.

1805
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:03,680
He's just popping that guy in the 
stomach with those straight left and you

1806
01:21:03,681 --> 01:21:06,170
don't like it and he knows that dude's 
getting tired.

1807
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:14,200
He threw his kicks dude.
Like he's pinning his leg together 

1808
01:21:15,891 --> 01:21:18,200
inside his crotch and just getting them 
to old.

1809
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:25,520
Just pick up connor if you wanted to 
jump in front.

1810
01:21:25,521 --> 01:21:27,920
Kicked him in the body.
Oh Shit.

1811
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,890
He's just teeing off on him.
I need to move.

1812
01:21:30,891 --> 01:21:35,891
And the dude's got hired.
He's so big a side kick him right now.

1813
01:21:36,741 --> 01:21:38,780
It just keeps popping and with that 
straight left,

1814
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:43,840
look at that.
This is crazy because this goes for a 

1815
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:48,220
few minutes back and guarantee that dude
is not doing a whole lot.

1816
01:21:51,530 --> 01:21:52,640
He's getting tired,
man.

1817
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:55,390
Look at him.
He's backing up.

1818
01:21:55,930 --> 01:21:57,490
Big giant.
Six foot.

1819
01:21:57,491 --> 01:21:58,480
What?
What does a six,

1820
01:21:58,481 --> 01:21:59,800
nine,
six,

1821
01:21:59,801 --> 01:22:01,000
nine,
three,

1822
01:22:01,001 --> 01:22:01,720
86.

1823
01:22:02,650 --> 01:22:03,550
He's getting tired.

1824
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:05,380
He's trying to grab them.
Nope.

1825
01:22:05,710 --> 01:22:06,640
Nope,
not today,

1826
01:22:06,641 --> 01:22:10,850
sir.
He's laughing.

1827
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:12,740
His father said.
He's like,

1828
01:22:13,010 --> 01:22:14,940
dude,
he was like a Bruce Lee laugh.

1829
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:15,930
Yeah.
Okay.

1830
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:18,740
This is real.
So you look at it over and over again.

1831
01:22:18,741 --> 01:22:20,460
It keep popping them with that straight 
left.

1832
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:21,960
It's funny,
man.

1833
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:23,790
It's weird to watch,
right?

1834
01:22:23,791 --> 01:22:25,440
He tried to give him a high five to 
stop.

1835
01:22:25,490 --> 01:22:26,880
His daughter said,
ah,

1836
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:29,130
yeah.
Okay.

1837
01:22:29,140 --> 01:22:30,570
No.
Oh,

1838
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:33,060
tagged him.
He's throwing.

1839
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:34,350
Yeah.
This is not into that.

1840
01:22:36,470 --> 01:22:39,910
Nothing to that.
Oh Dude.

1841
01:22:39,911 --> 01:22:40,630
Yeah.
He doesn't get that.

1842
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,270
He doesn't like it.
Those are hard shots

1843
01:22:50,370 --> 01:22:51,070
he gave up.

1844
01:23:04,390 --> 01:23:09,390
Oh Wow.
That was basically a real fight.

1845
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:18,280
That was a half a real fight.
That was like a half a real fight.

1846
01:23:18,370 --> 01:23:20,920
Right.
That looked like a real fight to me.

1847
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:23,620
Didn't they?
Didn't punch to the face.

1848
01:23:23,830 --> 01:23:25,360
I don't think he wanted a punch to the 
face.

1849
01:23:25,470 --> 01:23:26,990
It would have been a bad move.
Yeah.

1850
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:29,560
Just stick to the body.
You can't even reach his face.

1851
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:31,270
Yeah.
You're not going to hit that face.

1852
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:36,300
Look at what he does.
He throws a Kettlebell over the top of 

1853
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:36,300
the fucking do.
What if it landed on his head?

1854
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:37,960
Um,
you gotta watch the,

1855
01:23:37,961 --> 01:23:41,290
a youtube channel or the weather?
The instagram page.

1856
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:42,460
Is it instagram?
No.

1857
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:43,510
Twitter.
Jesus Christ.

1858
01:23:43,870 --> 01:23:45,310
Twitter page.
Hold my beer.

1859
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,860
Have you ever seen the twitter page?
Hold my beer.

1860
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:49,820
No.
Maybe Jude.

1861
01:23:49,821 --> 01:23:54,821
It's.
Is it perhaps the greatest twitter page 

1862
01:23:54,821 --> 01:23:57,331
that's ever existed and it's hold my 
beer while I do this and they do some 

1863
01:23:57,331 --> 01:24:00,310
stupid shit over and over again.
What does this hold my beer while I.

1864
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:01,270
Oh,
that's a good one.

1865
01:24:02,230 --> 01:24:04,270
He opened up a beer with a,
a football,

1866
01:24:04,271 --> 01:24:05,800
but that's not.
Scroll down a little bit.

1867
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,350
Let me show you my,
some ridiculous ones.

1868
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:10,660
You find the right one.

1869
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:18,420
There's a ton of videos of one guy did a
back flip.

1870
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:22,480
He tried to do a back flip off the top 
of these bricks.

1871
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:23,350
Oh,
don't do this one.

1872
01:24:23,351 --> 01:24:28,351
That one's horrible.
Guys going to karate kick that girl in 

1873
01:24:28,351 --> 01:24:28,351
the head.
I get this.

1874
01:24:28,351 --> 01:24:31,030
Oh,
be or why kicked this can off your head.

1875
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,460
Watch this guy hold my beer while I sit 
on an airbag.

1876
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:38,350
Watches.
What does the hold my beer?

1877
01:24:38,351 --> 01:24:39,460
Did they say that?
No,

1878
01:24:39,461 --> 01:24:40,660
no,
no they don't.

1879
01:24:41,530 --> 01:24:44,470
But um,
what's this one is you got light and the

1880
01:24:44,471 --> 01:24:45,340
guy on fire.
Oh,

1881
01:24:45,341 --> 01:24:47,440
Jesus Christ.
The fuck is he doing?

1882
01:24:47,470 --> 01:24:52,470
Oh,
it's basically hold my beer while I 

1883
01:24:52,470 --> 01:24:52,470
fucking ridiculous Easter.
Oh,

1884
01:24:52,470 --> 01:24:53,500
we blew up.
Oh Shit.

1885
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:55,840
Okay,
scroll down.

1886
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:56,710
Scroll down.
Not that one.

1887
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:57,610
Keep going.
Keep going.

1888
01:24:57,850 --> 01:25:00,190
That one right there.
This guy's pretty bad ass like that.

1889
01:25:00,870 --> 01:25:03,010
He actually made it.
Sometimes they may.

1890
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:04,960
Yeah,
but watch this one.

1891
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:07,540
It's good.
Oh Shit.

1892
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:11,530
I guess try to do a back flip off a 
stack of bricks or something.

1893
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:14,380
Okay,
that's enough.

1894
01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:16,980
That's enough.
But if anybody's interested,

1895
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:18,640
go to hold my beer on,
on twitter.

1896
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:21,730
It's fucking late.
I try to retweet them at least like once

1897
01:25:21,730 --> 01:25:23,200
a month.
He's fine.

1898
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:27,730
The most ridiculous shit.
Who's instagram accounts?

1899
01:25:28,170 --> 01:25:30,070
Oh yeah.
Do you find fun?

1900
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:30,880
I think,
uh,

1901
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:33,190
the beastmaster oh,
you mean Derek Lewis?

1902
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:34,230
Derrick Lewis.
The funny.

1903
01:25:34,231 --> 01:25:35,800
He's hilarious.
Follow him.

1904
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:40,090
Follow his instagram might be the best 
instagram I follow.

1905
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:45,820
Do you see the one where the dudes were 
trying to jump out of the way of some 

1906
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:45,820
rolling.
Hey,

1907
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:50,820
they got a bale of hay rolling down this
hill and they do try to jump out of the 

1908
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:53,430
way and got fucking launched into the 
air heats.

1909
01:25:53,540 --> 01:25:58,540
I mean,
he's the most gangster shit talkers in 

1910
01:25:58,540 --> 01:25:59,290
the UFC.
I mean,

1911
01:25:59,291 --> 01:26:01,870
he was more gangster than him.
He's more gangster than Tito did.

1912
01:26:01,871 --> 01:26:03,620
Mike Tyson,
you know what I mean?

1913
01:26:03,621 --> 01:26:04,310
Mike Tyson

1914
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:05,690
said crazy shit.
He said,

1915
01:26:05,691 --> 01:26:10,691
uh,
I'll eat your children eight the 

1916
01:26:10,691 --> 01:26:10,691
gentleman.
And he said,

1917
01:26:10,691 --> 01:26:10,691
um,
I'll fuck you to you love me.

1918
01:26:10,691 --> 01:26:13,490
But he said that before the fight,
you know,

1919
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,320
you after the fight.
He's not saying that.

1920
01:26:15,321 --> 01:26:18,080
You know what I mean?
He's not know when Derrick Lewis,

1921
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,960
when he called out Rhonda,
that was fucked up.

1922
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:23,300
That's a low blow.
That was a low blow.

1923
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:25,110
No one's done that.
No one,

1924
01:26:25,290 --> 01:26:30,290
even Roberto Duran called that said 
something about a sugar ray Leonard's 

1925
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:30,620
wife,
but that was before the fight.

1926
01:26:30,630 --> 01:26:33,530
Afterwards they become.
They became friends and then they became

1927
01:26:33,531 --> 01:26:38,531
friends.
I think it was after the second fight 

1928
01:26:38,531 --> 01:26:38,531
that became friends.
Yeah.

1929
01:26:38,531 --> 01:26:39,340
I have the first fight he tried to hold.
That was like one of the famous to watch

1930
01:26:39,341 --> 01:26:41,180
some movie there.
Roberto Duran pushed him away.

1931
01:26:41,390 --> 01:26:42,140
No,
I never saw it,

1932
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:46,010
but after the end of the first fight,
he tried to like embrace Duran Duran.

1933
01:26:46,010 --> 01:26:47,540
Pushed him well and he's still wanting 
to fight.

1934
01:26:47,630 --> 01:26:49,640
It's pretty crazy.
It's a crazy ending of the fight.

1935
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:55,180
See if you can pull up the video.
The very last moments of the round with 

1936
01:26:56,470 --> 01:26:59,540
the first time Roberto Duran fought 
sugar ray Leonard.

1937
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:03,380
He beat him and he knew at the end that 
he beat him and so when the bell rang,

1938
01:27:03,381 --> 01:27:08,381
you just fucking dropped his glove and 
he's like staring him down like he's 

1939
01:27:08,381 --> 01:27:08,381
still ready to go.
It's crazy.

1940
01:27:08,381 --> 01:27:11,030
Roberto Duran was a wild motherfucker 
back.

1941
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:16,060
You mentioned if after Michael Mike 
Tyson knocked out Michael spinks.

1942
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:18,800
Then when they get in the post binding 
or interview,

1943
01:27:18,810 --> 01:27:20,030
he said,
I'll eat his children.

1944
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:22,460
I can't imagine him saying that after 
the fight people will go,

1945
01:27:22,461 --> 01:27:27,461
what the fuck ways.
We have Michael spinks children at 

1946
01:27:27,461 --> 01:27:28,820
finance.
So this is,

1947
01:27:28,821 --> 01:27:29,960
uh,
the first fight.

1948
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:34,250
At the very end seconds he goes to shake
his hand.

1949
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:35,290
He's like,
fuck you.

1950
01:27:35,291 --> 01:27:36,530
So he comes near.
I'm looking at this,

1951
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,020
what the Fuck Outta here?
He pushes them away.

1952
01:27:39,021 --> 01:27:40,720
Fuck,
that was after the first fight.

1953
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:42,040
After the fight was over,
he pushed him.

1954
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:43,760
Riley's fucking screaming at him.
He's like,

1955
01:27:43,761 --> 01:27:46,220
fuck you.
Yeah.

1956
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:51,020
And when did he say that thing to sugar 
ray's wife before for this fight?

1957
01:27:51,021 --> 01:27:51,870
For this?
Yeah,

1958
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
that's right.
He got into Ted.

1959
01:27:53,270 --> 01:27:54,860
Did that to get in his head.
Oh,

1960
01:27:54,861 --> 01:27:57,520
well he was just that guy to the.
Apparently there was a,

1961
01:27:57,710 --> 01:28:01,700
there was an article written where they 
went to visit him and Panama and uh,

1962
01:28:01,730 --> 01:28:05,870
he took a cat and he picked it up by the
tail and smashed against a wall.

1963
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,070
And they were like,
well,

1964
01:28:07,071 --> 01:28:12,071
according to the movie it was a.
He had moments where he got out of 

1965
01:28:12,071 --> 01:28:16,901
control,
but generally it was a very good guy in 

1966
01:28:16,901 --> 01:28:16,901
the movie.

1967
01:28:16,901 --> 01:28:17,630
Two movies are weird.
I don't know if they're true,

1968
01:28:18,110 --> 01:28:20,200
but apparently he did that too.
I've read the story.

1969
01:28:20,210 --> 01:28:25,210
I don't,
I don't know what the story might be 

1970
01:28:25,210 --> 01:28:25,210
bullshit,
but I'm like,

1971
01:28:25,210 --> 01:28:25,210
if he was that crazy,
you know,

1972
01:28:25,210 --> 01:28:27,680
living on the streets in Panama,
like becoming a savage boxer.

1973
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:29,570
He was so good too,
man.

1974
01:28:29,571 --> 01:28:34,571
He was ferocious.
And when he beat up Davey Moore and 

1975
01:28:34,571 --> 01:28:38,051
Dave,
you remember that David Morris was 

1976
01:28:38,051 --> 01:28:38,051
thought to be the guy,
like in everybody thought after no moss.

1977
01:28:38,051 --> 01:28:41,120
Roberto Duran was done.
So they had this kid stud boxer,

1978
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:43,790
David,
more world champion at 1:54,

1979
01:28:43,791 --> 01:28:45,350
I believe.
That was after no months.

1980
01:28:45,410 --> 01:28:47,600
Yeah,
there was the comeback fight.

1981
01:28:47,660 --> 01:28:50,540
Roberto Duran,
when he was really fully back,

1982
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:52,770
he boxed up.
David Morgan stopped him,

1983
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:57,790
was a tremendous upset because David 
Moore was a lot bigger than them to 

1984
01:28:57,790 --> 01:28:57,790
white guy.
No,

1985
01:28:57,790 --> 01:28:59,510
David was black guy.
David wound up getting killed,

1986
01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:02,160
uh,
working on a car fucked

1987
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:07,160
up.
He was trying to fix his car and he 

1988
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:07,160
fucked up with the Jack and it crushed 
them.

1989
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:11,490
They could be conspiracy,
yes or no and look into it.

1990
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:16,260
Oh Man.
So,

1991
01:29:16,261 --> 01:29:18,210
um,
you saw the UFC this weekend.

1992
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:21,450
Do you see where I fucked up and I,
I interviewed Daniel cormay after he had

1993
01:29:21,451 --> 01:29:23,520
been knocked out.
Here's,

1994
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:26,500
here's something that's like,
people think that somehow or another,

1995
01:29:26,501 --> 01:29:28,860
a doc told me not to do that.
And I did it.

1996
01:29:28,861 --> 01:29:32,430
Nobody said anything.
It was just a 100 percent my fuck up.

1997
01:29:32,490 --> 01:29:37,490
And it was also my idea in the first 
place to stop interviewing fighters 

1998
01:29:37,490 --> 01:29:39,880
after they'd been knocked out.
It was 100 percent my idea.

1999
01:29:39,881 --> 01:29:42,000
And how often did it happen before in 
championship fights?

2000
01:29:42,001 --> 01:29:43,020
It happened often,
right?

2001
01:29:43,530 --> 01:29:48,530
Almost always.
Whether a guy got knocked out or Tko or 

2002
01:29:48,530 --> 01:29:51,630
submitted or last decision,
I would interview the winter and I would

2003
01:29:51,631 --> 01:29:53,610
interview the loser every time,
every time,

2004
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,760
unless they ran out of the cage,
which has happened before.

2005
01:29:57,090 --> 01:30:02,090
I get it.
So you're just on running on instincts 

2006
01:30:02,090 --> 01:30:02,090
and this is what happened.
Um,

2007
01:30:02,090 --> 01:30:06,540
I was there for Gonzaga versus cro cop.
Remember Gonzaga head kick,

2008
01:30:06,541 --> 01:30:07,180
Cro,
cop,

2009
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:12,440
and just fucking into oblivion and it 
was bad and I interviewed Cro Cop 

2010
01:30:12,601 --> 01:30:16,110
afterwards and I'm telling you,
that dude had no idea what I was talking

2011
01:30:16,111 --> 01:30:16,770
about.
Yeah.

2012
01:30:16,790 --> 01:30:19,890
And I remember saying to the,
to the production team at the time,

2013
01:30:19,891 --> 01:30:20,370
it was like,
man,

2014
01:30:20,371 --> 01:30:23,220
I don't think we should interview guys 
after they get knocked out like that.

2015
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:27,500
That was my nice my saying like that.
And then I'm.

2016
01:30:28,030 --> 01:30:33,030
The one time it happened again,
it was with allister and after when 

2017
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:36,231
Alistair overeem fuss deep,
a mule chick and he remembered this 

2018
01:30:36,231 --> 01:30:36,420
gating that didn't really happen.
You remembered a steep,

2019
01:30:36,421 --> 01:30:38,160
a tapping rather.
And it didn't really happen.

2020
01:30:38,610 --> 01:30:39,780
I was like,
this poor guy,

2021
01:30:40,050 --> 01:30:45,050
like he's,
he really has this memory in his head 

2022
01:30:45,050 --> 01:30:45,960
and it's just not correct because he 
just got knocked the fuck out.

2023
01:30:46,110 --> 01:30:48,180
He got knocked unconscious on 
television,

2024
01:30:48,181 --> 01:30:53,181
like completely flat line and then a few
minutes later I'm asking him to be 

2025
01:30:53,181 --> 01:30:53,181
coherent.
I'm like,

2026
01:30:53,181 --> 01:30:57,240
I don't think it's fair.
So it was my idea to stop doing this and

2027
01:30:57,241 --> 01:30:59,660
the UFC agreed.
So it's not like,

2028
01:31:00,130 --> 01:31:05,130
like they said,
we got to stop doing it and I viol 

2029
01:31:05,130 --> 01:31:06,870
violated my own idea and I just did it 
on.

2030
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:08,970
This is what happened after the fight 
was over.

2031
01:31:08,971 --> 01:31:12,150
First of all,
the fight was crazy.

2032
01:31:12,151 --> 01:31:17,151
Shocking how violent the ending was 
because John Really did fucking hate 

2033
01:31:18,121 --> 01:31:23,121
Daniel and Daniel I think really did 
hate John or at least had real anger.

2034
01:31:23,401 --> 01:31:26,100
There was real emotions with these guys.
It was insane.

2035
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:31,280
It was intense.
When John landed that fucking head kick 

2036
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:32,610
and you saw him moving in for the kill 
and then he,

2037
01:31:32,850 --> 01:31:37,850
he stopped them right in front of us.
He got on top of him and just blasted 

2038
01:31:37,850 --> 01:31:37,850
him.

2039
01:31:37,850 --> 01:31:40,620
It was like right there.
I remember looking over and I'm like,

2040
01:31:40,650 --> 01:31:45,650
Jesus,
he was just dropping del close real 

2041
01:31:45,650 --> 01:31:46,260
close to.
It was pretty close,

2042
01:31:46,261 --> 01:31:51,261
if I remember correctly.
I want to say it was like right off to 

2043
01:31:51,261 --> 01:31:52,110
my right.
If I remember correctly.

2044
01:31:52,190 --> 01:31:54,300
You had a good look at it.
I had a real good look at it.

2045
01:31:54,570 --> 01:31:56,160
Yeah,
I mean obviously I'm cage side.

2046
01:31:56,161 --> 01:31:58,890
I got a good look at everything,
but I had a real good look at that.

2047
01:31:58,891 --> 01:32:00,910
It intense.
It was intense and it was also.

2048
01:32:00,911 --> 01:32:02,800
I felt like there was a couple of shots,
too many,

2049
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:05,320
so I remember being stunned like,
oh,

2050
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:08,650
I'm a.
I'm a big fan of John Jones,

2051
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:11,860
but I'm also a big fan of Daniel and I'm
a fan of both of them.

2052
01:32:11,861 --> 01:32:14,290
I know they don't like each other,
but I like both of them.

2053
01:32:14,650 --> 01:32:15,940
I liked them independently.

2054
01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:17,950
It just,
I can't help the fact their enemies,

2055
01:32:17,951 --> 01:32:20,620
but I love hanging out with John and I 
love hanging out with Danny.

2056
01:32:20,621 --> 01:32:22,750
I love doing commentary with Daniel.
I love that guy.

2057
01:32:23,290 --> 01:32:26,980
So I would never do anything to make him
look bad.

2058
01:32:27,190 --> 01:32:29,140
I just got.
I was in shock.

2059
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:34,560
There was.
He was confused because he got knocked 

2060
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:36,901
out so he was confused that why the 
fight was stopped and said he was mad 

2061
01:32:37,361 --> 01:32:42,361
that they stopped the fight because he 
just didn't understand because he just 

2062
01:32:42,361 --> 01:32:43,390
been chaos.
So he was arguing with big John.

2063
01:32:43,660 --> 01:32:46,960
I didn't hear the exact words.
Then he was arguing with Dana.

2064
01:32:47,410 --> 01:32:49,060
I didn't hear the exact words that 
either,

2065
01:32:49,150 --> 01:32:54,150
but Dana was in front of me.
It's you got to realize when a Kao like 

2066
01:32:54,150 --> 01:32:58,021
that happens in a world championship 
fight and you're standing in the 

2067
01:32:58,021 --> 01:33:01,471
octagon,
you're surrounded by all these people 

2068
01:33:01,471 --> 01:33:01,471
screaming and cheering.

2069
01:33:01,471 --> 01:33:05,460
The fucking noise is so loud.
It's hard to figure out what the fuck is

2070
01:33:05,831 --> 01:33:08,860
happening.
So I couldn't figure out what Daniel and

2071
01:33:08,861 --> 01:33:10,250
Dana were arguing about,
but Dane,

2072
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:12,550
his whole head was red.
He was like,

2073
01:33:12,610 --> 01:33:14,530
he was like,
that fight was amazing.

2074
01:33:14,531 --> 01:33:19,531
He fought your heart out.
Like I couldn't tell exactly what he 

2075
01:33:19,531 --> 01:33:19,531
said,
like you'd hold your head up high.

2076
01:33:19,531 --> 01:33:20,020
It was a great fight,
that kind of stuff,

2077
01:33:20,350 --> 01:33:25,350
but I think Daniel was still trying to 
figure out why the fight was stopped 

2078
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:26,230
because it just had happened.
He'd just woken up.

2079
01:33:26,530 --> 01:33:31,530
Then he realized he got head kicked and 
then he was really sad and then he was 

2080
01:33:31,530 --> 01:33:34,861
upset and I went to go talk to him and 
literally as I'm going to talk to him,

2081
01:33:36,431 --> 01:33:38,320
he's turning to me and I have the 
microphone.

2082
01:33:38,321 --> 01:33:39,820
I'm like,
why am I interviewing him?

2083
01:33:39,821 --> 01:33:41,890
After he got knocked out,
what the fuck is wrong with me?

2084
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:43,600
Like I don't even realize what I was 
doing.

2085
01:33:43,601 --> 01:33:47,530
I was just in shock almost like I went 
on instinct and I'm interviewing him.

2086
01:33:47,950 --> 01:33:49,990
If I had a chance to stop and think I 
should have been like,

2087
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:51,580
oh yeah,
he's been Kao don't do it.

2088
01:33:51,730 --> 01:33:53,830
So in the middle of me even talking to 
him,

2089
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:56,920
I say I normally,
I don't like to interview fighters after

2090
01:33:56,921 --> 01:33:58,990
they've been knocked out,
but it's just like I was stuck.

2091
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:04,080
I was already there talking to him and I
didn't want to leave and walk away from 

2092
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:06,460
them and I really do care about that guy
a great deal.

2093
01:34:06,461 --> 01:34:09,910
And I just watched him get knocked out.
Now watch him.

2094
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:12,770
His heart's pouring out and he's crying,
you know,

2095
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:15,580
when he was realizing that he got 
knocked out and he lost the fight.

2096
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:18,790
It was all awful.
And um,

2097
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,080
so I put it a Po.

2098
01:34:20,140 --> 01:34:22,030
It was haunting me all night.
This is,

2099
01:34:22,031 --> 01:34:25,210
nobody had said anything.
Nobody from the UFC got mad at me.

2100
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:28,000
No one said anything to me.
There was just me thinking,

2101
01:34:28,001 --> 01:34:29,140
why did I do that?
Like,

2102
01:34:29,141 --> 01:34:34,141
why did I interview him?
I shouldn't have interviewed him even 

2103
01:34:34,141 --> 01:34:34,870
though we used to do it for every fight.
Um,

2104
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:39,220
it was the right move to stop doing it.
And ironically it was my idea.

2105
01:34:39,310 --> 01:34:41,380
It was my move.
I don't even know if other guy.

2106
01:34:41,381 --> 01:34:46,381
I don't know if Brian standstill 
interviews guys after they've been 

2107
01:34:46,381 --> 01:34:46,381
knocked out.
I don't think he does though,

2108
01:34:46,381 --> 01:34:50,790
because Brian Actually said thank you to
me for that because he got interviewed 

2109
01:34:50,921 --> 01:34:54,370
after he got knocked out by vandelay and
he remembers thinking,

2110
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:57,580
I don't remember what happened.
He didn't know what the fuck and they're

2111
01:34:57,590 --> 01:35:02,590
interviewing him.
He's trying to keep it together for the 

2112
01:35:02,590 --> 01:35:02,590
interview.

2113
01:35:02,590 --> 01:35:02,590
And he was like,
you're right.

2114
01:35:02,590 --> 01:35:05,981
It's not fair.
It's not fair to interview a fighter 

2115
01:35:05,981 --> 01:35:05,981
after they've been knocked out.
I just fucked up man.

2116
01:35:05,981 --> 01:35:07,420
There's no other way to say it.
I just,

2117
01:35:07,421 --> 01:35:08,040
uh,
I,

2118
01:35:08,270 --> 01:35:10,550
if I could go back,
I definitely would have taken it back.

2119
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:12,900
I definitely wouldn't have interviewed 
him because I feel,

2120
01:35:13,010 --> 01:35:18,010
I feel like he didn't.
And he sent me a text message saying 

2121
01:35:18,010 --> 01:35:18,440
it's all good.
I didn't say anything crazy,

2122
01:35:18,441 --> 01:35:21,260
so it's no big deal.
But you know,

2123
01:35:21,261 --> 01:35:22,710
he could have,
you know,

2124
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:24,520
he could have said I never got stopped.
I could have said,

2125
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:25,040
you know,
he could,

2126
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:30,280
you don't think anything.
Like if somebody doesn't explain to him 

2127
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:32,531
well enough what happened?
And then it takes a few seconds and you 

2128
01:35:32,531 --> 01:35:36,191
forget again.
That's the other thing about guys have 

2129
01:35:36,191 --> 01:35:36,191
been knocked out.
Like you say,

2130
01:35:36,191 --> 01:35:39,701
if,
if I got knocked out and I asked you at 

2131
01:35:39,701 --> 01:35:39,701
what happened and you said,
oh,

2132
01:35:39,701 --> 01:35:40,380
this dude just punched you in your jaw 
and knocked you out.

2133
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:41,630
And be like,
no way.

2134
01:35:41,910 --> 01:35:42,920
Hey Man.
What happened?

2135
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:47,950
Like as a few seconds later,
you start asking again when you get 

2136
01:35:47,950 --> 01:35:47,950
knocked out.
It's real weird.

2137
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:51,230
So it's a huge fuck up on my part.
But it was,

2138
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:52,760
I was in shock.
Honestly.

2139
01:35:53,050 --> 01:35:58,050
It was so ferocious.
The final barrage was so ferocious and 

2140
01:35:58,251 --> 01:36:00,560
there was the way it was.
The Way John did it when you heard them,

2141
01:36:00,710 --> 01:36:03,680
once he knew he heard them,
he just started going after him.

2142
01:36:03,710 --> 01:36:06,440
And one of the spookiest things that he 
did,

2143
01:36:06,441 --> 01:36:07,550
was he,
the way he tripped him,

2144
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:13,520
see what he tripped him like Daniel's 
like sort of stumbling back and John 

2145
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:16,991
just sorta scoops his leg out from under
him and Trypsin Daniel Falls back and 

2146
01:36:16,991 --> 01:36:20,951
John just moves in on him and you could 
tell Daniel just couldn't get his feet 

2147
01:36:20,951 --> 01:36:22,400
back under them and John just jumped on 
him and just marked them.

2148
01:36:23,150 --> 01:36:25,160
[inaudible] did great on his feet for 
awhile there.

2149
01:36:25,161 --> 01:36:30,161
He did great.
But I was really impressed with John 

2150
01:36:30,161 --> 01:36:32,390
John Stryker to.
He throws so much unorthodox.

2151
01:36:32,391 --> 01:36:35,960
She,
those stomps on the knees do.

2152
01:36:36,140 --> 01:36:38,450
That's high level shit.
And the volume.

2153
01:36:38,820 --> 01:36:40,150
Yes.
Throwing strikes.

2154
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:40,700
Yeah.
That's his,

2155
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:43,330
that's his shit.
He was in tremendous shape.

2156
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:46,540
Stolen those uh,
those elbows from,

2157
01:36:46,570 --> 01:36:48,440
you know,
from left field,

2158
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:50,000
you know,
right down the pipe.

2159
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:52,820
Yeah.
He's done a lot of elbows,

2160
01:36:52,821 --> 01:36:54,530
man.
And he's throwing all kinds of shit.

2161
01:36:54,531 --> 01:36:59,531
He throws everything front kicks.
There was a lot of front kick right to 

2162
01:36:59,531 --> 01:36:59,531
the.
Yeah.

2163
01:36:59,531 --> 01:37:02,100
Those fret snap kegs throws those 
oblique kicks in.

2164
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:04,610
Hyperextends your needed love that can't
get close to him.

2165
01:37:04,790 --> 01:37:05,490
I'd love that.
Whoa,

2166
01:37:05,510 --> 01:37:08,630
I hope it keeps going because he's 
evolving so much as a striker.

2167
01:37:08,870 --> 01:37:13,870
I hope he.
I hope against hope it gets good to 

2168
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:13,870
gather 100 percent.

2169
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:15,380
You never seen him arrested again.
No more bullshit.

2170
01:37:15,381 --> 01:37:17,000
No one cares about that.
I do.

2171
01:37:17,090 --> 01:37:20,840
Don't want them to get arrested again.
It's like he tore his acl.

2172
01:37:20,841 --> 01:37:23,660
What's the difference?
I believe that he's going to be back.

2173
01:37:24,020 --> 01:37:25,600
I know it doesn't matter.
Let them party.

2174
01:37:25,601 --> 01:37:26,990
He's the king of the world.
He's the.

2175
01:37:27,290 --> 01:37:30,140
He's the probably the best fighter of 
all time.

2176
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:35,440
Let them do some coke.
Let them party data should be getting 

2177
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:35,750
some house.
You know what I mean?

2178
01:37:36,020 --> 01:37:37,370
Fuck it.
He gets fucked up.

2179
01:37:37,450 --> 01:37:39,530
Hey,
that's actually better press.

2180
01:37:39,770 --> 01:37:44,320
So what he needs is like you should fake
Duis and drunk and stoned just like they

2181
01:37:44,321 --> 01:37:45,260
do.
And TMZ,

2182
01:37:45,290 --> 01:37:49,420
he just needs a constant security detail
to keep everything away from him.

2183
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:50,930
Let him,
let him do whatever he wants.

2184
01:37:50,931 --> 01:37:53,000
He's the king of the fucking world.
You don't want them getting.

2185
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:56,970
We'd lost a whole year of him and then 
we lost a year before that.

2186
01:37:56,970 --> 01:37:59,570
I don't want him to get Tyson that 
that's for sure.

2187
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:02,420
He can get locked up for five years.
That shit happens.

2188
01:38:02,421 --> 01:38:07,421
A peanut.
You want what you want them to do is 

2189
01:38:07,421 --> 01:38:07,421
have fun,
but don't do anything illegal.

2190
01:38:07,421 --> 01:38:07,490
Don't let him drive.
Take us.

2191
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:10,440
Take his keys.
Still want to do anything illegal.

2192
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:15,840
Saturday team.
Have a rubber party room locked up,

2193
01:38:17,530 --> 01:38:18,280
but just say,
dude,

2194
01:38:18,281 --> 01:38:20,160
you'd go off five hours,
whatever you want.

2195
01:38:20,161 --> 01:38:21,900
Boom,
but you can leave this room.

2196
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:24,150
Do you ever been to one of them?
A bouncy warehouses?

2197
01:38:24,151 --> 01:38:29,151
We can go from one trampoline to the 
next champion that all the time,

2198
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:32,550
me and my son go the time.
Those are the best man.

2199
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:34,650
Best.
So anyway,

2200
01:38:35,010 --> 01:38:38,580
even though I already talked to Daniel,
I felt like I put it on twitter.

2201
01:38:38,581 --> 01:38:42,030
I apologize on instagram and I was like,
I gotta apologize in the podcast too.

2202
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:44,490
I fucked up and it was just a.
It was.

2203
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:46,380
There was no other explanation.
Is it?

2204
01:38:46,450 --> 01:38:48,960
Is it because of the name of his crying 
face?

2205
01:38:48,990 --> 01:38:50,430
No,
I'm just meeting just to talk to them.

2206
01:38:50,431 --> 01:38:51,900
That means you're going to have names,
man.

2207
01:38:52,340 --> 01:38:54,180
You got to accept me as part of the 
other ones.

2208
01:38:54,181 --> 01:38:55,440
Come to mind.
There's so many.

2209
01:38:55,441 --> 01:38:58,660
Knock out means you have the Rashad 
Evans one that's pretty pop.

2210
01:38:58,661 --> 01:39:00,900
It's one of the most of the Jose Aldo 
one.

2211
01:39:00,901 --> 01:39:02,790
That's pretty good.
That's on the underground.

2212
01:39:03,690 --> 01:39:04,620
The underground.
Boom.

2213
01:39:04,621 --> 01:39:07,460
It's the Jose Aldo.
Get clipped by A.

2214
01:39:07,460 --> 01:39:12,460
There's so many of them.
Did you ever see the video of the dude 

2215
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:13,020
that came up to Rashad and asked him to 
sign one of the posters of a shot?

2216
01:39:13,021 --> 01:39:18,021
All fucked up where we say that again?
Some dude had the balls to come up to 

2217
01:39:18,031 --> 01:39:18,870
Rashad at,
uh,

2218
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:23,430
one of those signings and try to get 
Rashad to sign the picture.

2219
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:25,260
The one picture.
Where is all Jack?

2220
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:29,500
And try to get them to sign that.
Rashad crumpled it up.

2221
01:39:29,550 --> 01:39:30,000
Him Up.

2222
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:32,730
He thought he was being cute.
What's this?

2223
01:39:32,970 --> 01:39:34,820
That's the dude.
He walks up to him.

2224
01:39:34,821 --> 01:39:36,030
He says,
get the fuck out of here man.

2225
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:38,970
Oh Shit.
Damn.

2226
01:39:39,810 --> 01:39:40,260
He's like,
no,

2227
01:39:40,261 --> 01:39:41,100
get out of here.
Go.

2228
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:45,630
You want to hear it?
So hold on.

2229
01:39:45,970 --> 01:39:46,240
Oh,
that,

2230
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:49,410
rewind it.
So it will go before that.

2231
01:39:49,411 --> 01:39:50,670
When you see him rip it up.

2232
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:58,250
Mexicans here dammit.
Mexicans hands in the picture.

2233
01:40:02,110 --> 01:40:05,710
Crumples it up and throws it at me.
He's laughing and he pushes him and like

2234
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:06,380
get out of here man.

2235
01:40:15,630 --> 01:40:17,070
He's laughing.
This is cute.

2236
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:18,630
Rashad looked like he was going to smash
him.

2237
01:40:22,330 --> 01:40:27,330
He took a picture with a friend though 
because I think it was photoshop Steve 

2238
01:40:27,330 --> 01:40:31,260
that made a.
He made a photoshop of like a shot of 

2239
01:40:31,420 --> 01:40:36,420
inside of a plane and see everyone's 
sitting down and see a bunch of people 

2240
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:39,810
and you know,
sometimes you know when you're on a 

2241
01:40:39,810 --> 01:40:39,810
plane and going overseas and everyone's 
crashed out at night,

2242
01:40:39,810 --> 01:40:39,810
you know what I mean?
You're walking,

2243
01:40:39,910 --> 01:40:41,140
you go take a piss.
And everyone,

2244
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:43,610
everyone has their crash out face.
Right?

2245
01:40:43,870 --> 01:40:48,490
So he put like all those famous knockout
faces on people on a planet.

2246
01:40:48,491 --> 01:40:51,330
And you were in there too.
I think you were wide awake though.

2247
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:54,300
You're wide awake and all of these like 
beat door knocked

2248
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:59,300
on over here so far was one of the 
greatest photoshops of all time.

2249
01:40:59,471 --> 01:41:04,471
I don't know where it's at though.
That's just a price that you pay if 

2250
01:41:04,471 --> 01:41:05,250
you're going to be a part of that world,
that world,

2251
01:41:05,870 --> 01:41:08,740
if you,
when you get an insane amount of glory,

2252
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:13,860
you know,
but you only get that glory because 

2253
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:13,860
there's a risk of getting the opposite 
of that.

2254
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:14,860
Jamie Foxx was talking about the other 
day.

2255
01:41:14,861 --> 01:41:17,680
We were talking about Michael Jordan 
that a lot of people don't even know who

2256
01:41:17,681 --> 01:41:19,270
Michael Jordan is.
They just know,

2257
01:41:19,271 --> 01:41:21,130
Oh,
you the cry baby face you.

2258
01:41:21,131 --> 01:41:26,131
That made me face.
People see that meme and you cease to 

2259
01:41:26,131 --> 01:41:27,940
become an individual.
Been crying in that meeting.

2260
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:30,670
What was the original source of that?
I don't know.

2261
01:41:31,060 --> 01:41:33,890
What was the interview?
I think it was hall of fame induction in

2262
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:36,940
the hall.
I was talking about his haters.

2263
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,690
He was calling out his haters really in 
his hall of fame can here that God.

2264
01:41:40,691 --> 01:41:42,550
It's one of the craziest hall of fame 
speeches ever.

2265
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:44,950
It made people reevaluate how they feel 
about them.

2266
01:41:45,190 --> 01:41:47,350
Some people lost all respect.
I want to hear that.

2267
01:41:47,351 --> 01:41:52,351
Some people understood it.
He's talking shit about like reporters 

2268
01:41:52,351 --> 01:41:53,170
and coaches and hair play.
It's kind of telling the truth,

2269
01:41:53,390 --> 01:41:55,670
I'm sure,
but it's just fascinating to listen to.

2270
01:41:55,780 --> 01:41:59,150
Oh No,
this isn't it.

2271
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:03,770
This is like how to fail and still be a 
winner and all that shit.

2272
01:42:05,990 --> 01:42:07,930
Here it goes here.
This shit.

2273
01:42:07,950 --> 01:42:09,410
Twenty three minutes launch.
That's okay.

2274
01:42:09,411 --> 01:42:12,110
Just give me a little volume.
Let's get to the good part.

2275
01:42:12,350 --> 01:42:12,760
Yeah.

2276
01:42:15,110 --> 01:42:16,250
Kind and said,
yeah,

2277
01:42:16,251 --> 01:42:18,280
I do it.
And that was a disrespect to,

2278
01:42:18,281 --> 01:42:20,900
into my Carolina guys.
They all know them.

2279
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:23,210
I'm a true Blue Carolina guide to the 
heart,

2280
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:24,260
you know,
coach Smith,

2281
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:25,250
Larry Brown,

2282
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:28,110
Sam Perkins,
James Worthy,

2283
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:30,450
all of those guys.

2284
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:33,630
Well,
it all starts with my,

2285
01:42:33,770 --> 01:42:35,360
my parents.
Uh,

2286
01:42:35,370 --> 01:42:37,440
you guys see all the highlights.
What is,

2287
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:39,420
what is it about me that you guys don't 
know?

2288
01:42:39,810 --> 01:42:44,810
Uh,
as I sat up and I watch all the other 

2289
01:42:44,810 --> 01:42:47,061
recipients stand up here and they give 
them the history and so many things I 

2290
01:42:47,061 --> 01:42:49,440
didn't know about Jerry Sloan and know 
he lived on the farm,

2291
01:42:49,441 --> 01:42:54,330
but I didn't know he was in a small 
classroom from first grade to the eighth

2292
01:42:54,331 --> 01:42:55,700
grade.
Uh,

2293
01:42:56,340 --> 01:42:59,470
even David Robinson,
obviously I've known David for some time

2294
01:42:59,480 --> 01:42:59,630
and

2295
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:02,400
we're going to lose the audience here.
Let's see.

2296
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:04,170
I don't know what the part where he got 
mad at people,

2297
01:43:04,171 --> 01:43:09,171
but he was maybe a youtube.
Michael Jordan insults gets mad.

2298
01:43:10,770 --> 01:43:11,640
Oh,
he mad.

2299
01:43:11,730 --> 01:43:12,690
Oh yeah,
something like that.

2300
01:43:12,691 --> 01:43:13,690
Michael.
Michael Jordan.

2301
01:43:15,270 --> 01:43:16,360
How about Michael Jordan?
Oh,

2302
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,450
he mad.
Jamie's eating that cake.

2303
01:43:18,451 --> 01:43:21,590
Shake those things to share.
I think I have one fuck right now.

2304
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:24,300
A bunch in the frazier.
Frigerator back there.

2305
01:43:24,660 --> 01:43:26,410
They're all Quito to.
Yeah,

2306
01:43:26,420 --> 01:43:28,830
give me one of them.
Yeah.

2307
01:43:30,090 --> 01:43:32,040
No affiliation with this company.
Ladies and gentlemen.

2308
01:43:32,190 --> 01:43:34,230
They're just good.
I don't know shit about them.

2309
01:43:34,890 --> 01:43:36,930
They might be monsters.
Yeah,

2310
01:43:36,931 --> 01:43:38,520
those are good man.
Yeah,

2311
01:43:38,521 --> 01:43:40,080
you got to shake it a little bit.
There you go.

2312
01:43:40,770 --> 01:43:43,140
They're very thick.
It's like a,

2313
01:43:43,141 --> 01:43:45,510
um,
like a milkshake or some shit.

2314
01:43:45,511 --> 01:43:47,390
What flavors are strawberry?
Powerful.

2315
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:49,560
Right.
Um,

2316
01:43:49,770 --> 01:43:52,040
so what did you think about the Cyborg?
I felt like

2317
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:55,070
it was kind of weird seeing Tanya 
evenger.

2318
01:43:55,071 --> 01:43:57,730
So outsized,
you know,

2319
01:43:58,040 --> 01:43:59,720
fighting Cyborg,
who's like,

2320
01:43:59,721 --> 01:44:00,560
yeah,
it's real thick.

2321
01:44:00,670 --> 01:44:04,340
Like sometimes I eat it with a spoon.
What'd you think about that fight?

2322
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:07,860
Cyborg is just too goddamn good.
Tania Singer,

2323
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:13,120
she's the old girl.
She's tough and she's out of her weight 

2324
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:13,400
class.
She almost didn't have a chance almost.

2325
01:44:13,430 --> 01:44:18,430
You know what I mean?
She had a chance but wasn't the best 

2326
01:44:18,430 --> 01:44:19,010
chance and sideboard fought a very 
technical fight.

2327
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:22,380
She's such a good striker.
Jesus super technical now too.

2328
01:44:22,381 --> 01:44:24,410
You see she's not taking too many crazy 
chances.

2329
01:44:24,411 --> 01:44:28,580
She's just picking our spots.
She's a machine and she's really good on

2330
01:44:28,581 --> 01:44:30,800
the ground.
Too hard to take down.

2331
01:44:30,810 --> 01:44:32,940
Hereso Breslin's good.
Her work ethics.

2332
01:44:32,970 --> 01:44:34,610
Insane.
She's legit brown belt,

2333
01:44:34,611 --> 01:44:35,510
right?
Is it Jean?

2334
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,250
Is She?
I believe she is.

2335
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:38,960
Last I heard.
I didn't know.

2336
01:44:39,170 --> 01:44:42,050
Maybe she's got a black but,
but she's legit.

2337
01:44:42,290 --> 01:44:43,910
What was impressive to me that,
you know,

2338
01:44:43,911 --> 01:44:48,911
like evenger was like trying to be 
crafty and move around and be an 

2339
01:44:49,041 --> 01:44:52,430
unorthodox and throwing a good job.
And she was looking for a response.

2340
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:56,960
Just she was just outgun but Cyborg 
didn't just try to gorilla fucker.

2341
01:44:57,100 --> 01:44:58,420
You know what?
I know she didn't just try to check her,

2342
01:44:58,490 --> 01:45:01,220
chase her down and smash her.
She picked apart out her,

2343
01:45:01,430 --> 01:45:04,700
did a great,
a great job of hacking at the legs,

2344
01:45:04,910 --> 01:45:09,910
landon shots,
and then once she had her time to 

2345
01:45:09,910 --> 01:45:09,910
evergreen.
I'd love that girl.

2346
01:45:09,950 --> 01:45:11,810
You know what's,
she's tough as fuck,

2347
01:45:11,811 --> 01:45:15,350
man.
Just one of the coolest things about mma

2348
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:19,310
is how openmindedness we are with 
lesbians,

2349
01:45:19,311 --> 01:45:20,450
right?
I mean we don't even.

2350
01:45:20,451 --> 01:45:23,750
It's no big deal at all with girls.
Put her on the countdown show.

2351
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:26,150
Two girls.
The Nunez is the champ.

2352
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:27,590
Yes.
And no one knows.

2353
01:45:27,870 --> 01:45:29,900
We're like totally cool.
We're all,

2354
01:45:29,930 --> 01:45:34,930
you know Tom [inaudible] on instagram 
live making out with chicks at bars 

2355
01:45:34,930 --> 01:45:34,930
drinking.
You know what I mean?

2356
01:45:34,930 --> 01:45:35,690
Yeah.
She's,

2357
01:45:35,780 --> 01:45:40,730
she's a party girl and you're allowed to
be a big old lesbian.

2358
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:43,570
Yeah.
We're so open minded.

2359
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:48,890
Guys were still in Jesus.
Only one dude want to do that I know of.

2360
01:45:49,070 --> 01:45:50,990
That's openly gay.
Gay Porn.

2361
01:45:50,991 --> 01:45:51,920
It was on tough.
Oh,

2362
01:45:52,610 --> 01:45:55,670
wait a minute.
There's an ultimate versus name Dakota,

2363
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:58,640
Dakota Cochrane,
I think his name was cock ring.

2364
01:45:58,870 --> 01:46:02,690
No Cochran.
That's his last name right there.

2365
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:06,050
That was like a sub.
That was a part of the show.

2366
01:46:06,140 --> 01:46:08,450
That's what they were talking about.
Damn.

2367
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:09,350
Okay.
There's one.

2368
01:46:09,351 --> 01:46:10,490
Yeah,
hold on.

2369
01:46:10,510 --> 01:46:12,020
I'm still,
we're way behind.

2370
01:46:12,021 --> 01:46:14,630
We're way behind because there should be
at least,

2371
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:18,310
but I don't necessarily mean there 
should be saying.

2372
01:46:18,530 --> 01:46:23,530
Okay.
I think he was just saying he did gay 

2373
01:46:23,530 --> 01:46:23,530
porn.
I'm out.

2374
01:46:23,530 --> 01:46:23,530
You know what?
I love gay people.

2375
01:46:23,530 --> 01:46:25,870
My favorite singer of all time.
He's a Favi gang.

2376
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:29,260
Uh,
anyways.

2377
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:34,560
Uh,
I have no problem with problem with 

2378
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:34,560
people being gay.
I think they should come out.

2379
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:38,860
You know,
I lived in West Hollywood for almost 20 

2380
01:46:38,860 --> 01:46:38,860
years.
You were surrounded by gay people.

2381
01:46:38,860 --> 01:46:40,760
Every time I visit,
you either swim to a river.

2382
01:46:40,761 --> 01:46:42,770
Gay people come to your house.
Yeah.

2383
01:46:42,870 --> 01:46:44,630
Yeah.
If you got,

2384
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:46,870
if you're a guy,
you were still in Jesus' times,

2385
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:48,050
unfortunately.
I mean,

2386
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:49,980
maybe,
maybe it's not

2387
01:46:50,430 --> 01:46:53,880
the best thing that come out if you're 
an m and a right,

2388
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:56,660
but it's for comedy.
Nobody gives a fuck.

2389
01:46:56,690 --> 01:46:58,020
Football people care,
right?

2390
01:46:58,110 --> 01:46:59,730
You can be.
Can you be openly gay,

2391
01:46:59,790 --> 01:47:02,280
openly gay in football.
How many guys does one or two?

2392
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:07,880
There's that one guy came out right 
before the draft and you got right now 

2393
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:08,670
there's a few now about how many.
I mean not tons.

2394
01:47:08,671 --> 01:47:12,750
It's probably equal to the population.
Maybe like 10 percent.

2395
01:47:13,130 --> 01:47:14,730
No.
Well way football.

2396
01:47:14,810 --> 01:47:16,240
No Way.
Guys,

2397
01:47:16,390 --> 01:47:21,390
why do you think there's 50 openly gay 
football players want to believe?

2398
01:47:23,570 --> 01:47:24,570
I want to believe you.
Well,

2399
01:47:24,571 --> 01:47:26,310
Google going to say I'm going to say 
too.

2400
01:47:26,311 --> 01:47:28,890
Okay.
You say to say to I say five.

2401
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:30,120
Jamie,
what do you say?

2402
01:47:31,530 --> 01:47:36,200
Say something I wasn't saying.
I'll just be right close to the average.

2403
01:47:36,210 --> 01:47:37,680
So it's like what?
Eight to 10 percent.

2404
01:47:37,681 --> 01:47:42,681
So it's probably like 30,
$40 out of the closet is what I'm 

2405
01:47:42,681 --> 01:47:42,681
talking about this.
No,

2406
01:47:42,681 --> 01:47:42,681
no,
no.

2407
01:47:42,681 --> 01:47:47,091
That's what I'm talking about.
The national average is not considered 

2408
01:47:47,091 --> 01:47:47,091
out of the closet.
Does it?

2409
01:47:47,091 --> 01:47:48,330
Nationally?
Just how many people are gay?

2410
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:53,360
Yes,
but how many people are out of the 

2411
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:55,521
closet in the NFL?
I say there's one or two says there's 

2412
01:47:55,521 --> 01:47:58,401
been a lot,
but there have been 11 known gay 

2413
01:47:58,401 --> 01:47:58,401
players.
Nana and they all got.

2414
01:47:58,401 --> 01:47:58,401
Come on.

2415
01:47:58,401 --> 01:48:00,950
They're all there now,
but it's interesting.

2416
01:48:01,220 --> 01:48:03,920
We're not that open.
No guys are not that open.

2417
01:48:04,010 --> 01:48:06,520
There's a lot of players.
Think about how many players there are.

2418
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:08,010
Yeah.
All right.

2419
01:48:08,030 --> 01:48:11,510
Now let's go this way.
What percentage of the population is gay

2420
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:14,540
versus what percentage of the population
is out of the closet?

2421
01:48:15,290 --> 01:48:19,190
Oh Shit.
I think if you had to guess

2422
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:21,630
of all of all the gay people in the 
United States,

2423
01:48:21,631 --> 01:48:25,230
I would say I'm going to guess 50 
percent are out of the closet.

2424
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:29,250
Fifty one new thing.
Thirty or out of the.

2425
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:30,540
Yeah,
it could be 30.

2426
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:32,550
It could be 10.
It could be 10.

2427
01:48:32,670 --> 01:48:35,220
Depending on where you live.
If you're in California,

2428
01:48:35,221 --> 01:48:38,010
you're still in the closet.
You're probably a UFC fighter.

2429
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:47,410
Were you around when the Edmonton fight 
happens?

2430
01:48:47,470 --> 01:48:52,470
Are you around during that week?
What day you got to do a fight 

2431
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:55,630
companion.
This is a kind of interesting.

2432
01:48:55,890 --> 01:49:00,890
Um,
this is totally unrelated to this 

2433
01:49:00,890 --> 01:49:00,890
weekend.
This is actually,

2434
01:49:00,890 --> 01:49:00,890
what is it?
September ninth.

2435
01:49:00,890 --> 01:49:01,270
September ninth?
Yeah.

2436
01:49:01,380 --> 01:49:02,560
Is that a Saturday?
Yeah.

2437
01:49:02,561 --> 01:49:04,750
Saturday.
I'm,

2438
01:49:04,751 --> 01:49:09,751
I'm there on Friday it Edmonton for um,
you're doing two shows at this 

2439
01:49:12,670 --> 01:49:14,060
auditorium.
I'm,

2440
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:16,740
uh,
the jubilee auditorium to two shows that

2441
01:49:16,741 --> 01:49:18,880
this theater,
but I'm not doing the paper due the next

2442
01:49:18,881 --> 01:49:19,430
night.
Okay.

2443
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:22,330
So we'll do a fight compatible.
I go back home.

2444
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:24,070
Yeah.
It was weird because it's a,

2445
01:49:24,220 --> 01:49:28,420
it's a main event.
It's a mighty mouse versus a Ray Borg.

2446
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:30,700
And Amanda Nunez Ares Valentina 
Shevchenko,

2447
01:49:31,300 --> 01:49:36,300
but there,
I don't think they're anticipating that 

2448
01:49:36,300 --> 01:49:36,300
it's going to be a,
a high pay per view cell.

2449
01:49:36,300 --> 01:49:36,940
Know.
Let's do it.

2450
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,200
That sounds like fun.
Yeah,

2451
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:39,490
it's on.
See.

2452
01:49:39,820 --> 01:49:44,820
I would like to get callan and shot,
but shops become too fucking successful.

2453
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,040
He's too successful.
That fucking

2454
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:50,020
baller.
He's traveling all over the place.

2455
01:49:50,021 --> 01:49:53,050
Selling out everywhere he's selling out 
theaters has been doing standup for like

2456
01:49:53,051 --> 01:49:54,810
six weeks.
He sounds out.

2457
01:49:57,100 --> 01:49:58,930
He's been doing it more than that.
He's been doing it like a year,

2458
01:49:59,140 --> 01:50:01,630
but he's selling out everywhere down.
Dude.

2459
01:50:01,631 --> 01:50:03,240
He did what I said.
I was like,

2460
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:04,660
I was telling all these other comedians.
I say,

2461
01:50:04,661 --> 01:50:06,250
you see what you've seen here.
I go,

2462
01:50:06,251 --> 01:50:09,430
this is what happens when an athlete 
shows you how lazy you guys are.

2463
01:50:09,820 --> 01:50:11,590
Like this guy was like just starting 
out,

2464
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:14,860
but he actually works at it.
He does like a ton of sets.

2465
01:50:14,861 --> 01:50:16,900
He writes a ton.
Like he actually puts in the time,

2466
01:50:16,901 --> 01:50:21,901
like that's what athletes do.
Comics like to pretend they're working 

2467
01:50:21,901 --> 01:50:25,230
and they fuck off a lot and keep doing 
the same machine material for 10 years 

2468
01:50:25,230 --> 01:50:26,910
and shop is like out there.
So again,

2469
01:50:27,070 --> 01:50:29,250
I'm no expert at comedy,
but it's,

2470
01:50:29,410 --> 01:50:32,500
I think in my opinion,
it's a lot like Jujitsu.

2471
01:50:32,530 --> 01:50:37,530
You gotta practice and refund.
It's a lot like writing music because 

2472
01:50:37,530 --> 01:50:37,530
you can,
you.

2473
01:50:37,530 --> 01:50:39,490
If you're going to rely on just going up
there and riff and fuck,

2474
01:50:39,491 --> 01:50:41,050
good luck,
good luck.

2475
01:50:41,070 --> 01:50:43,150
It's like trying to write a song like,
okay,

2476
01:50:43,151 --> 01:50:45,070
we're going to record a song.
We have no idea what we're going to do,

2477
01:50:45,071 --> 01:50:47,010
but we're going to jam.
And he all right,

2478
01:50:47,020 --> 01:50:49,150
and then we'd go and that's the hit 
song.

2479
01:50:49,330 --> 01:50:51,640
The odds of that happening,
super slim.

2480
01:50:51,830 --> 01:50:54,520
You've got to record a jam,
pick out a little pieces,

2481
01:50:54,610 --> 01:50:57,550
Polish it,
add this two months later,

2482
01:50:57,580 --> 01:50:58,930
oh,
you got a middle part.

2483
01:50:58,931 --> 01:51:02,230
Now a month later you got the intro.
It's all coming together.

2484
01:51:02,330 --> 01:51:04,120
Might take eight months to get that bit 
together.

2485
01:51:04,121 --> 01:51:09,121
You know,
you're just constantly going back and 

2486
01:51:09,121 --> 01:51:10,441
forth.
That's how music is put together and 

2487
01:51:10,441 --> 01:51:12,451
that's how Jujitsu's put together.
You've got to constantly refine your 

2488
01:51:12,451 --> 01:51:12,451
game.

2489
01:51:12,451 --> 01:51:13,390
You're out there getting ready,
what are you doing wrong?

2490
01:51:13,420 --> 01:51:15,760
What's working?
Let's stick to what's working with.

2491
01:51:15,790 --> 01:51:18,220
Add some new shit,
learning from other people,

2492
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:23,460
techniques and being open minded,
understanding that your body is magical 

2493
01:51:24,790 --> 01:51:29,790
and it'll do anything you wanted to do.
You just got to tell it over and over 

2494
01:51:29,790 --> 01:51:30,970
and over again to a point where it does 
it by itself,

2495
01:51:30,971 --> 01:51:34,510
without you even knowing what the hell 
is going on and it's unconscious.

2496
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:36,610
You could do anything.
You could play piano,

2497
01:51:36,611 --> 01:51:38,620
you can play a guitar.
It's like,

2498
01:51:38,630 --> 01:51:39,670
Oh,
I tried guitar,

2499
01:51:39,671 --> 01:51:41,890
but it's too hard.
You just didn't practice.

2500
01:51:42,070 --> 01:51:43,510
That's all.
Anybody could play guitar.

2501
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:45,960
Anybody could play guitar.
Anybody can play piano songs.

2502
01:51:45,970 --> 01:51:50,970
Your neurons fire correctly.
It's just your hands move just takes 

2503
01:51:50,970 --> 01:51:52,330
time.
You got in a motorcycle accident and you

2504
01:51:52,331 --> 01:51:54,850
smash your hands and you're like this.
You can't play piano,

2505
01:51:55,180 --> 01:51:57,310
but I'm just saying if you have normal 
limbs,

2506
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:59,200
you could play piano,
could play guitar,

2507
01:51:59,201 --> 01:52:00,100
you can do anything.

2508
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:01,480
You could.
You could do anything.

2509
01:52:01,750 --> 01:52:04,330
You can learn Jujitsu.
You can box.

2510
01:52:04,331 --> 01:52:09,331
You can play basketball.
He never played basketball in your life 

2511
01:52:09,331 --> 01:52:11,290
and you're 55 years old.
If you practiced hard for a year,

2512
01:52:11,410 --> 01:52:15,250
it'd be I.
I know people don't want to believe that

2513
01:52:15,251 --> 01:52:17,260
though.
It's hard for them to believe it because

2514
01:52:17,261 --> 01:52:22,261
they're not reminded of it all the time.
That's why a lot of people coming from 

2515
01:52:22,261 --> 01:52:26,011
Jujitsu and martial arts in general,
they become successful because through 

2516
01:52:26,011 --> 01:52:30,240
Jujitsu you're constantly reminded that 
you can suck at something and then you 

2517
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:33,010
get pretty good at it and then you 
mastered and then it's unconscious.

2518
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:37,120
You reminded that every time you go to 
Jujitsu everyday you're reminded,

2519
01:52:37,121 --> 01:52:39,340
damn,
I can do this with anything,

2520
01:52:39,490 --> 01:52:41,020
and people do it with their business.
They go,

2521
01:52:41,050 --> 01:52:44,740
all I gotta do is do hustle in the in 
the Gi,

2522
01:52:44,990 --> 01:52:46,160
Jujitsu of business

2523
01:52:46,550 --> 01:52:48,980
and make it happen or whatever you want 
to do.

2524
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:50,420
You're reminded like,
Shit.

2525
01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:52,640
You like it.
When I say magical,

2526
01:52:52,641 --> 01:52:57,641
it's not a metaphor.
It is magical because your body will do 

2527
01:52:57,641 --> 01:53:00,281
shit on its own.
Like when you like when you're doing 

2528
01:53:00,281 --> 01:53:00,740
Jujitsu,
sometimes I come up with moves.

2529
01:53:00,741 --> 01:53:05,741
I don't know what the fuck I did.
I did something I have no idea and then 

2530
01:53:05,741 --> 01:53:09,401
it comes up again because I've 
programmed and drilled my body so much 

2531
01:53:09,401 --> 01:53:13,181
and has so many things that I trained it
to do a on instincts that it's kind of 

2532
01:53:13,311 --> 01:53:18,311
like a suggestion thing.
Like when you hit youtube and they kind 

2533
01:53:18,311 --> 01:53:18,311
of know what you like and here's the 
suggestions,

2534
01:53:18,311 --> 01:53:23,200
like your body will go.
He always does this and he always does 

2535
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:23,330
that and he always does this 
unconsciously.

2536
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:26,330
Man,
he might like this and then you're like,

2537
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:27,050
oh shit.

2538
01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:32,050
What was that?
It's like your body can someone else 

2539
01:53:32,050 --> 01:53:32,050
came up with that and then the next time
you do like,

2540
01:53:32,050 --> 01:53:36,610
there it is again.
That's how most of the moves that are 

2541
01:53:36,610 --> 01:53:40,601
transitions that I get good at.
They come up like on their own and then 

2542
01:53:40,601 --> 01:53:41,340
the third time we got I got it and then 
I videotape,

2543
01:53:41,370 --> 01:53:43,170
but then I've videotaped myself doing 
it.

2544
01:53:43,171 --> 01:53:43,760
I'm like,
Shit,

2545
01:53:43,940 --> 01:53:45,650
I didn't even know I was doing that.
It was just like,

2546
01:53:45,830 --> 01:53:49,070
your body will make shit up for you.
You everybody.

2547
01:53:49,071 --> 01:53:50,720
Not just me.
It's everybody.

2548
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:54,270
You just gotta learn how to capture it.
It's like comedy p.

2549
01:53:54,290 --> 01:53:59,290
people love comedy because they go see a
comedian and he's saying all this shit 

2550
01:53:59,290 --> 01:53:59,510
that they agree with and they're 
laughing and going,

2551
01:53:59,511 --> 01:54:01,220
yeah,
I think that this,

2552
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:04,460
this comedian is amazing.
He saying shit that if you're laughing,

2553
01:54:04,461 --> 01:54:05,250
you agree with that.

2554
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:10,360
Like you all the shit that he said 
you've set and people around you have 

2555
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:15,191
said it.
You just didn't notice it as something 

2556
01:54:15,191 --> 01:54:15,270
to use on stage.
So once you.

2557
01:54:15,410 --> 01:54:17,660
It's just like music when you.
Every time you listen to music,

2558
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:22,720
like for me,
anytime I listen to music and I like 

2559
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:22,720
something musically,
which is rare,

2560
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:24,230
I'm going to find out everything about 
that song.

2561
01:54:24,350 --> 01:54:26,630
There's that.
I don't ever get lazy with that.

2562
01:54:26,690 --> 01:54:29,990
I find out who sang the song,
I downloaded the song,

2563
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:33,500
I analyze a song like,
what is it about this song that makes it

2564
01:54:33,501 --> 01:54:35,970
so great?
Why am I getting chills listening to the

2565
01:54:35,971 --> 01:54:37,910
song?
Why do I have this song on repeat?

2566
01:54:38,270 --> 01:54:39,230
You know,
that's.

2567
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:43,640
I'm trained musically to always try to 
capture golden nuggets.

2568
01:54:43,641 --> 01:54:44,710
Every time I hear it,
oh,

2569
01:54:44,780 --> 01:54:49,780
I'll be in a middle of a conversation in
Japan at Tgi Fridays in Tokyo and in the

2570
01:54:50,900 --> 01:54:55,900
distance a song would come on and I'm in
the conversation with some people and I 

2571
01:54:55,900 --> 01:54:55,900
hear it and it just.

2572
01:54:55,900 --> 01:54:58,850
I know that I tell the people I'm with,
I'll be right back.

2573
01:54:58,851 --> 01:55:00,730
I gotta find out what the song is.
I'll write it down them.

2574
01:55:01,070 --> 01:55:03,230
I just do the other Dj.
That's kind of a DJ thing.

2575
01:55:03,650 --> 01:55:07,650
So my point is it's same thing with 
Jujitsu.

2576
01:55:07,651 --> 01:55:11,000
It same thing with comedy.
It's same thing with music.

2577
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:13,580
You just gotTa.
It's all around you.

2578
01:55:13,820 --> 01:55:18,820
You just gotTa look for it.
You've got to train yourself to look 

2579
01:55:18,820 --> 01:55:21,371
for.
Maybe you have to write shit on your 

2580
01:55:21,371 --> 01:55:21,371
hand to train,
remind yourself,

2581
01:55:21,371 --> 01:55:21,371
think,
think about.

2582
01:55:21,371 --> 01:55:26,210
Then once that becomes your instinct 
once looking for shit and recognizing 

2583
01:55:26,210 --> 01:55:28,110
should always be on the call for Shit.
Like uh,

2584
01:55:28,370 --> 01:55:33,370
for instance,
like editors do to edit videos every 

2585
01:55:33,370 --> 01:55:33,370
time they're watching a movie,
what are they doing?

2586
01:55:33,370 --> 01:55:35,340
They're breaking down the editing.
You're right,

2587
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:37,700
of course like movie makers are breaking
down the lighting.

2588
01:55:37,701 --> 01:55:40,880
They're watching them and we feel the 
hidden directors of movies,

2589
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:42,470
you know,
a lot of ways,

2590
01:55:42,471 --> 01:55:44,370
like the directors,
they get all these ideas,

2591
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:49,600
they put it together,
but a lot of times you'd get on a 

2592
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:52,280
television show as well to editor will 
make these passes at things when they 

2593
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:53,520
give you like a,
like an editor's first cut.

2594
01:55:53,521 --> 01:55:54,630
And a lot of times it's like,
you know,

2595
01:55:54,631 --> 01:55:56,010
the director would look at and go,
I liked that.

2596
01:55:56,011 --> 01:55:56,970
Like that.
That's good.

2597
01:55:57,210 --> 01:55:59,610
You don't get any better.
You got to have an editor who,

2598
01:55:59,700 --> 01:56:01,550
who knows,
who knows this.

2599
01:56:01,610 --> 01:56:02,030
He,
yeah.

2600
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:07,040
You got to be talented.
Not just some slave that's gonna cut 

2601
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:09,921
shit together.
And there's a lot of talent and the 

2602
01:56:09,921 --> 01:56:09,960
editing you to be,
especially in television shows.

2603
01:56:09,961 --> 01:56:12,230
Right?
Or I guess in movies too,

2604
01:56:12,750 --> 01:56:13,370
you know?
Yeah,

2605
01:56:13,420 --> 01:56:16,810
I get the editors that I got working 
from his hot level.

2606
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:20,790
Amazing that editor like that movies are
still in a theater now,

2607
01:56:20,860 --> 01:56:24,550
so one of the rare things you do when 
you go somewhere like just to,

2608
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:26,180
to get,
uh,

2609
01:56:26,670 --> 01:56:29,520
some,
some sort of art where it's not live,

2610
01:56:29,700 --> 01:56:34,700
you're going to go to a place still,
like they still have them like that and 

2611
01:56:34,700 --> 01:56:35,560
I don't know if I'd been brainwashed 
because I love,

2612
01:56:35,850 --> 01:56:40,850
I love to,
but I'm just saying it's weird because 

2613
01:56:40,850 --> 01:56:41,670
it's like one of the few places we have 
left,

2614
01:56:41,970 --> 01:56:44,820
we'll,
we'll go and take in media at a,

2615
01:56:44,821 --> 01:56:46,110
at a specific location.

2616
01:56:46,110 --> 01:56:48,660
We all meet,
like we go for a live show,

2617
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:51,170
we'll go for a live show,
but if you,

2618
01:56:51,300 --> 01:56:55,270
you're not going to go to see like have 
a fake band somewhere.

2619
01:56:56,130 --> 01:56:59,170
Gigantic screen that's like a 100 times 
bigger than you.

2620
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:02,060
And the sound is amazing.
Yeah.

2621
01:57:02,061 --> 01:57:07,061
So there's all that crazy though.
Then it's cool sitting with people and 

2622
01:57:07,061 --> 01:57:07,420
when they laugh you laugh and it's 
continual.

2623
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:10,050
You want to laugh more when there's 
other people around,

2624
01:57:10,051 --> 01:57:15,051
but you run the risk of douchebags run 
the risk that people talk and people 

2625
01:57:15,540 --> 01:57:20,130
talk and the people that do that violate
the sacred laws of the movie theater.

2626
01:57:20,190 --> 01:57:24,900
You got to go in which big old Como de 
shades and a beanie and a fake beard.

2627
01:57:25,770 --> 01:57:26,940
Crazy.
You know,

2628
01:57:26,941 --> 01:57:28,650
beards are.
So in these days,

2629
01:57:28,980 --> 01:57:31,410
what happened to the fake beard market?
Like,

2630
01:57:31,411 --> 01:57:35,220
why isn't there like dudes like wearing 
fake beards to clubs and you know what I

2631
01:57:35,221 --> 01:57:37,540
mean,
like posing fake shit.

2632
01:57:37,860 --> 01:57:40,430
Girls can wear fake asses.
They can have fake tits.

2633
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:41,880
Fake,
fair,

2634
01:57:42,450 --> 01:57:47,450
fair.
It's kind of like there's a lot of 

2635
01:57:47,450 --> 01:57:47,450
things that aren't fair.
And that's one thing that they got,

2636
01:57:47,450 --> 01:57:47,610
you know,
we can't have,

2637
01:57:47,611 --> 01:57:51,120
we can't be the same.
So whoever was deciding on men and women

2638
01:57:51,121 --> 01:57:51,540
like,
okay,

2639
01:57:51,541 --> 01:57:52,710
you get this,
you get that.

2640
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:54,330
It isn't fair.
Like the women were like,

2641
01:57:54,331 --> 01:57:55,290
okay,
okay,

2642
01:57:55,291 --> 01:57:56,340
if you're gonna,
uh,

2643
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:58,980
you get uh,
you guys,

2644
01:57:59,040 --> 01:57:59,820
you know,
they're,

2645
01:58:00,060 --> 01:58:01,410
they,
they can't control it.

2646
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:06,440
Guys are attracted to girls with nice 
bodies fit by.

2647
01:58:07,230 --> 01:58:09,730
Generally.
There are some guys just nice bodies,

2648
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:13,920
like there's something about actual fake
tits that's hot because it's like,

2649
01:58:13,921 --> 01:58:14,820
wow,
this girl is.

2650
01:58:14,940 --> 01:58:19,940
She's in the deck so much.
She just wants to be like ultra 

2651
01:58:19,940 --> 01:58:23,790
attractive in a cartoonish way.
Like look at those giant fake tits jet.

2652
01:58:23,970 --> 01:58:25,500
Some guys,
some guys are like,

2653
01:58:25,501 --> 01:58:30,501
I don't like fake tits.
They're still some of those guys out 

2654
01:58:30,501 --> 01:58:31,380
there that there's like a 15 percent of 
the population.

2655
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:34,560
Eventually another generation,
those will be all gone and fake.

2656
01:58:34,561 --> 01:58:37,620
Tits would just be accepted by all men,
but fake ass.

2657
01:58:37,650 --> 01:58:42,650
Woo.
That's going to take a couple of 

2658
01:58:42,650 --> 01:58:42,650
generations.
That's going to happen.

2659
01:58:42,650 --> 01:58:42,650
This.
Nobody

2660
01:58:42,670 --> 01:58:44,890
is cool with fake asses.
Nobody.

2661
01:58:44,891 --> 01:58:47,470
That's the worst shit ever.
The don't get it.

2662
01:58:47,471 --> 01:58:48,830
Girls don't even think about it.
Yeah,

2663
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:53,880
but the gray area is this fat thing 
they're doing and what is not a fake 

2664
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:58,411
ass,
but they're taking fat grafting fat 

2665
01:58:58,411 --> 01:58:59,100
that's still grow parts.
Do some squats,

2666
01:58:59,440 --> 01:59:02,440
do some squats.
Anybody could have a great body,

2667
01:59:02,441 --> 01:59:04,450
just do some squats.
Not that's not true.

2668
01:59:04,480 --> 01:59:06,620
There's some people out there that got 
some fucked up.

2669
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:09,490
There's nothing wrong with hillbilly 
stick.

2670
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:11,350
Stick people,
those people,

2671
01:59:11,351 --> 01:59:14,050
you got to get good at sucking Dick,
you gotta eat ass.

2672
01:59:14,650 --> 01:59:17,350
You eat ass and sucked it.
I don't want to.

2673
01:59:17,650 --> 01:59:20,010
They think they have no choice to get 
the fat.

2674
01:59:20,460 --> 01:59:22,900
Stuff's want to reengineer.
The older you get,

2675
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:28,040
the more women eat.
As I was reading this thing about 

2676
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:30,541
Crispr,
that they're starting to use crispr for 

2677
01:59:30,541 --> 01:59:33,001
a Jew for embryos now,
and they think they're really close to 

2678
01:59:33,001 --> 01:59:33,640
genetically engineering.

2679
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:36,760
The first people that become viable,
actual humans.

2680
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:38,530
Do you know what Crispr is?
No,

2681
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:42,330
dude,
it's like photoshop for jeans.

2682
01:59:42,890 --> 01:59:47,890
They're looking at this scientist edit 
human embryos for the first time in the 

2683
01:59:47,890 --> 01:59:47,890
US.
They're,

2684
01:59:47,890 --> 01:59:52,690
they're using this new technology which 
is way more complicated than my puny 

2685
01:59:52,690 --> 01:59:57,601
brain has the ability to describe,
but it's a gene editing tool called 

2686
01:59:57,601 --> 01:59:58,990
crispr and there is a,
an episode,

2687
01:59:59,020 --> 02:00:04,020
another episode of radio lab that's 
about crispr that it might be like a 

2688
02:00:04,020 --> 02:00:06,910
good way for you to get an entertaining 
but descriptive,

2689
02:00:07,300 --> 02:00:08,560
uh,
explanation of it.

2690
02:00:08,860 --> 02:00:09,430
But,
uh,

2691
02:00:09,490 --> 02:00:14,490
they're,
they're going to be able to at least 

2692
02:00:14,490 --> 02:00:14,490
someday in the future if this keeps 
going,

2693
02:00:14,490 --> 02:00:19,350
they keep perfecting this.
They're going to be able to edit things 

2694
02:00:19,350 --> 02:00:22,021
out of people like they're going to be 
able to take away the the gene for 

2695
02:00:22,021 --> 02:00:22,400
Alzheimer's,
you know?

2696
02:00:23,260 --> 02:00:23,770
I don't know.

2697
02:00:24,790 --> 02:00:25,670
What do you mean?
You don't know?

2698
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:31,080
I don't know.
They always say shit like in the future 

2699
02:00:31,080 --> 02:00:33,630
doing it now and they're doing it now.
Like there's real science behind this.

2700
02:00:33,821 --> 02:00:35,650
Like you could,
you could follow the science.

2701
02:00:35,950 --> 02:00:39,790
They're editing things the same way.
They're making photoshop the same way.

2702
02:00:39,791 --> 02:00:42,400
They're making that new thing that 
allows them to edit videos.

2703
02:00:42,401 --> 02:00:45,430
They're gonna edit genes.
How about those contact lenses where you

2704
02:00:45,431 --> 02:00:50,020
can play video games and you're seeing 
some Microsoft made and stuff?

2705
02:00:50,050 --> 02:00:51,460
Yeah,
I don't think they have that yet.

2706
02:00:51,461 --> 02:00:56,461
I think they have glasses so far,
but I don't think they have contact 

2707
02:00:56,461 --> 02:00:56,461
lenses.
Contact Lenses.

2708
02:00:56,590 --> 02:00:57,840
Retinal.
Yeah.

2709
02:00:57,970 --> 02:00:59,720
It's going to happen.
If you could do it with a,

2710
02:00:59,850 --> 02:01:01,390
with the glass,
like Google.

2711
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:03,070
You ever see Google glass?
You ever put that on?

2712
02:01:03,430 --> 02:01:06,220
It was weird that Google glass isn't 
around anymore.

2713
02:01:06,221 --> 02:01:08,500
They've got some new applications for 
it.

2714
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:11,440
But what it was like was like,
um,

2715
02:01:11,590 --> 02:01:14,800
like a glass frame and yeah.
This little thing in front of you like a

2716
02:01:14,801 --> 02:01:19,801
little window,
like a tiny little tv that was sitting 

2717
02:01:19,801 --> 02:01:22,501
in front of your eyes because it's clear
and on that little window you could see 

2718
02:01:22,501 --> 02:01:24,190
through it,
but you could also see like a navigation

2719
02:01:24,250 --> 02:01:29,250
directions and uh,
you could google things and have it 

2720
02:01:29,250 --> 02:01:29,740
brought up in front of you and maybe 
steal shit.

2721
02:01:30,670 --> 02:01:31,450
Yeah,
like some,

2722
02:01:31,540 --> 02:01:34,300
some movie shit.
But it was like the Internet,

2723
02:01:34,570 --> 02:01:37,240
like you're making phone calls.
I know these guys,

2724
02:01:37,241 --> 02:01:38,440
you know,
they're not,

2725
02:01:38,441 --> 02:01:39,880
I have no idea who people are.
I mean,

2726
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:40,160
don't

2727
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:42,070
like drinking it.
Yeah.

2728
02:01:42,071 --> 02:01:42,770
You need to stab.
Well,

2729
02:01:42,771 --> 02:01:47,771
let's not do it while the podcast going 
on and just sucking on that thing and 

2730
02:01:47,771 --> 02:01:47,771
chewing it.
A spoon.

2731
02:01:48,570 --> 02:01:49,910
Okay.
Real quick.

2732
02:01:50,440 --> 02:01:54,290
S black helicopters.
Um,

2733
02:01:54,370 --> 02:01:55,730
they're good though.
I like them.

2734
02:01:56,210 --> 02:02:01,060
You got a spoon or no?
Eddie Bravo.

2735
02:02:01,061 --> 02:02:03,490
Abandoned you in the middle of a podcast
for a knife.

2736
02:02:03,590 --> 02:02:06,730
I'm sorry.
You offered it defaults.

2737
02:02:06,980 --> 02:02:11,980
Cave shakes blowing up.
Now their stock's going through the 

2738
02:02:11,980 --> 02:02:11,980
roof.
What were we just talking about?

2739
02:02:11,980 --> 02:02:16,130
This ar stuff.
This is going to be built into apple's 

2740
02:02:16,130 --> 02:02:18,150
new operating system,
allows you to read how big something is.

2741
02:02:18,180 --> 02:02:23,180
It's a virtual tape measure that you 
just hold your camera up to stuff and 

2742
02:02:23,180 --> 02:02:23,880
you can talk like they're right here.
They're showing you that is how accurate

2743
02:02:23,881 --> 02:02:27,720
it is.
But like it see the tape measure staying

2744
02:02:27,721 --> 02:02:32,721
there.
They're measuring the size of a picture 

2745
02:02:32,721 --> 02:02:34,740
frame diagonally and it stays in space.
Uh,

2746
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:36,330
if I'm saying,
if you get what I'm saying,

2747
02:02:36,331 --> 02:02:39,720
like I do the three d space,
it knows where you're modeling depending

2748
02:02:39,721 --> 02:02:41,850
on how far away you are from it and 
those.

2749
02:02:42,060 --> 02:02:47,060
Wow.
The other weird thing is by watching 

2750
02:02:47,060 --> 02:02:47,160
that show,
the planet of the Apps,

2751
02:02:47,161 --> 02:02:50,970
they just started on apple music,
but I think it was in the first episode.

2752
02:02:51,530 --> 02:02:54,900
The Sky shows an APP that he made that I
think apple bought.

2753
02:02:55,020 --> 02:02:58,140
Eventually they're adding into this 
operating system.

2754
02:02:58,260 --> 02:03:02,550
They're mapping the inside of every,
everywhere that your camera can take,

2755
02:03:02,551 --> 02:03:04,560
a place or a shooting.
So,

2756
02:03:04,950 --> 02:03:09,950
uh,
inside here eventually we'll be all 

2757
02:03:09,950 --> 02:03:09,950
mapped.
And this guy said that he,

2758
02:03:09,950 --> 02:03:11,580
he would own the map.
That's why apple bottoms.

2759
02:03:11,581 --> 02:03:16,581
Now apple's going to own it,
so they're essentially going to be able 

2760
02:03:16,581 --> 02:03:16,581
to have the inside three d maps of 
every,

2761
02:03:16,581 --> 02:03:20,991
in every building in the world or at 
least wherever and telling me what that 

2762
02:03:20,991 --> 02:03:20,991
sorry.

2763
02:03:23,540 --> 02:03:25,350
But uh,
it's built into the phone.

2764
02:03:25,351 --> 02:03:30,351
So there's other cool stuff too,
so they can map everything just based 

2765
02:03:30,351 --> 02:03:30,900
on.
We'll get there eventually.

2766
02:03:30,901 --> 02:03:31,230
Yeah.
Like,

2767
02:03:31,231 --> 02:03:33,720
so they did something came out about 
Roombas,

2768
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:38,840
like the room are currently tracking at 
the inside of everybody's houses and 

2769
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:40,170
apartments and I don't know what the 
hell they're going to do with that data,

2770
02:03:40,171 --> 02:03:44,610
but people got scared they're going to 
sell it to someone can be good.

2771
02:03:44,640 --> 02:03:46,260
You know what I mean?
How is that going to be good?

2772
02:03:46,380 --> 02:03:47,970
We're doing this to protect you.
How?

2773
02:03:48,260 --> 02:03:51,900
It's not about protection necessarily,
but it could be used.

2774
02:03:51,901 --> 02:03:54,180
You guys have trillions of dollars 
missing.

2775
02:03:54,210 --> 02:03:56,100
It could be useful.
It's not the same people,

2776
02:03:56,101 --> 02:03:56,460
Eddie.
Yeah.

2777
02:03:56,461 --> 02:04:01,461
I mean if Jesus Christ you keep making 
these things are not people as the 

2778
02:04:01,461 --> 02:04:05,460
Illuminati that run the government.
This can help blind pizza technologists.

2779
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:07,440
These are people that are creating the 
greatest stuff.

2780
02:04:07,730 --> 02:04:08,820
Yeah.
Sorry.

2781
02:04:09,170 --> 02:04:10,440
Okay,
yeah,

2782
02:04:10,470 --> 02:04:12,420
I mean this is not the illuminati making
this stuff.

2783
02:04:12,421 --> 02:04:13,160
Eddie.
This is,

2784
02:04:13,270 --> 02:04:15,350
this is technologist as apple.
Yeah.

2785
02:04:15,380 --> 02:04:17,100
The,
apple's not the fucking Illuminati.

2786
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:20,160
I didn't sell the apple did get in 
trouble recently.

2787
02:04:20,310 --> 02:04:22,320
Do you know what they did in China?
They,

2788
02:04:22,321 --> 02:04:27,321
uh,
they made a deal with the Chinese 

2789
02:04:27,321 --> 02:04:28,701
government to um,
to take aps down from their APP store 

2790
02:04:28,701 --> 02:04:32,160
that allow you to circumnavigate their,
a censorship system.

2791
02:04:32,610 --> 02:04:37,610
People were very,
very upset at them because what 

2792
02:04:37,610 --> 02:04:40,370
essentially is a,
they're saying that apps are illegal in 

2793
02:04:40,370 --> 02:04:43,221
China,
so they're not allowing them on the 

2794
02:04:43,221 --> 02:04:45,081
apple store,
but they're illegal in China because 

2795
02:04:45,081 --> 02:04:45,870
they allow them to get away from 
government censorship.

2796
02:04:46,050 --> 02:04:49,380
So government censorship has a certain 
lock down on what you're allowed to look

2797
02:04:49,381 --> 02:04:51,690
at online.
Here it is.

2798
02:04:51,930 --> 02:04:56,930
Apple Removes Apps from the Chinese 
store that help Internet users of aid 

2799
02:04:56,930 --> 02:04:56,930
censorship.

2800
02:04:56,930 --> 02:05:00,870
Very disappointing to people because 
they feel like apple kind of like,

2801
02:05:00,871 --> 02:05:03,900
feels like maybe they have to do this 
other New York Times trying to get us to

2802
02:05:03,901 --> 02:05:05,190
pay.
How dare you?

2803
02:05:05,191 --> 02:05:07,860
New York Times.
No one's paying for articles online.

2804
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:11,520
Just stop,
just stop with the FEC pays for articles

2805
02:05:11,521 --> 02:05:13,010
online.
Who gets newspapers,

2806
02:05:13,120 --> 02:05:18,120
still have your old.
Do you ever get one of your in a hotel 

2807
02:05:18,120 --> 02:05:20,040
and they offer you the USA Today to see 
what the fuck the world pay attention to

2808
02:05:20,130 --> 02:05:24,210
man USA Today.
That's like a CNN of newspapers.

2809
02:05:24,510 --> 02:05:29,510
If you had to guess like what percentage
of people actually read the whole USA 

2810
02:05:31,110 --> 02:05:31,680
Today?
Every day.

2811
02:05:32,610 --> 02:05:34,020
Two percent.
No Way.

2812
02:05:34,710 --> 02:05:37,560
Less than one percent.
Less than one for sure.

2813
02:05:37,830 --> 02:05:42,030
One hundred percent,
but that was just making a point to,

2814
02:05:42,070 --> 02:05:47,070
well,
it's just like a e entertainment news 

2815
02:05:47,070 --> 02:05:47,070
for the world,
you know?

2816
02:05:47,070 --> 02:05:48,510
It's like,
it's like very surface.

2817
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:54,960
Yeah.
I mean it's just you're supposed to get 

2818
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:54,960
it at a hotel,
like what's going on?

2819
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:54,960
Oh,
we won the football game.

2820
02:05:55,110 --> 02:05:59,490
What do you think about that?
Other religions of Donald Trump and CNN.

2821
02:06:00,970 --> 02:06:05,970
What?
What I think was crazy was it cnn went 

2822
02:06:05,970 --> 02:06:07,470
and found the guy who made the meme and 
put it online and they scared him.

2823
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:08,280
Gangster,
right?

2824
02:06:08,281 --> 02:06:09,200
Yeah.
Like what are you doing?

2825
02:06:09,201 --> 02:06:10,800
Matt?
And them blackmail them,

2826
02:06:10,801 --> 02:06:12,030
but what,
how crazy is that?

2827
02:06:12,031 --> 02:06:14,220
Like you don't think that that's funny.
Is that what you're saying?

2828
02:06:14,221 --> 02:06:15,750
Like he was in the wwe,
you know,

2829
02:06:15,751 --> 02:06:20,751
donald was in the wwe,
you knew that that video is available 

2830
02:06:20,751 --> 02:06:22,710
and they put a CNN thing over your face.
You're actually mad at that.

2831
02:06:23,040 --> 02:06:28,040
You at that.
You're not mad at the six point 

2832
02:06:28,040 --> 02:06:28,040
$5,000,000,000,000
missing,

2833
02:06:28,040 --> 02:06:29,400
but you're mad at that.
That seems pretty fucking crazy to me.

2834
02:06:29,820 --> 02:06:34,820
That seems pretty crazy to me.
You're going to go after a guy who made 

2835
02:06:34,820 --> 02:06:35,540
a comical meme about the president body 
slamming you,

2836
02:06:35,700 --> 02:06:38,100
made him apologize publicly.

2837
02:06:38,100 --> 02:06:43,100
Dude.
How many memes are there of a sucking 

2838
02:06:43,100 --> 02:06:43,100
dicks?
GotTa be thousands,

2839
02:06:43,100 --> 02:06:47,530
right?
It's like the golden rule of the 

2840
02:06:47,530 --> 02:06:49,191
Internet.
If there's a photo of you online 

2841
02:06:49,191 --> 02:06:51,411
somewhere,
someone has photoshop to dick in your 

2842
02:06:51,411 --> 02:06:51,411
mouth and now it's going to get even 
crazier.

2843
02:06:53,110 --> 02:06:57,720
There's probably at least 50 gay.
You just showed me the one you showed me

2844
02:06:57,721 --> 02:07:01,390
of you and me in a wrestling statue with
the dudes grabbing the Dudek.

2845
02:07:01,450 --> 02:07:02,150
Yup.
Yup.

2846
02:07:02,250 --> 02:07:04,050
That's what photoshop,
Steve,

2847
02:07:05,450 --> 02:07:10,450
but what it.
My point is that they would get so mad 

2848
02:07:10,450 --> 02:07:12,780
at that that they would go after the guy
who made it.

2849
02:07:12,810 --> 02:07:15,540
That sort of reinforces the side of 
trump.

2850
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:19,540
Like people don't get that.
They don't understand that if you,

2851
02:07:20,020 --> 02:07:22,230
you,
you have something that's comical,

2852
02:07:22,290 --> 02:07:27,290
right?
Like that meme of Donald Trump's slam 

2853
02:07:27,290 --> 02:07:30,000
and CNN and then you go find the guy who
was just joking around,

2854
02:07:30,210 --> 02:07:32,820
made a little animated Gif joking 
around,

2855
02:07:32,821 --> 02:07:33,540
put it online.

2856
02:07:33,540 --> 02:07:35,620
I thought it was funny.
Everybody a laugh,

2857
02:07:35,860 --> 02:07:37,930
you know all he smashed.
In fact fake news.

2858
02:07:37,931 --> 02:07:38,790
Ha Ha,
ha ha.

2859
02:07:39,090 --> 02:07:42,850
And you go and scare that guy.
You go and scare that guy.

2860
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:44,140
What are you doing?
What's going on?

2861
02:07:44,440 --> 02:07:46,450
You know what's scarier?
You're CNN.

2862
02:07:46,660 --> 02:07:51,660
What's scarier than that is that there's
still people that watch that shit every 

2863
02:07:51,660 --> 02:07:52,020
day.
Yeah.

2864
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:55,240
After that,
after knowing that you're going to still

2865
02:07:55,241 --> 02:07:57,950
watch it and believe it.
The other thing was the store,

2866
02:07:57,951 --> 02:08:01,060
they made up about Russian contacts 
about,

2867
02:08:01,061 --> 02:08:06,061
uh,
there's like three reporters had to 

2868
02:08:06,061 --> 02:08:08,071
resign.
It was store that was on cnn to like 

2869
02:08:08,071 --> 02:08:09,040
greatly exaggerated.
I think CNN is,

2870
02:08:09,610 --> 02:08:12,490
they just want to start shit.
I think it's not the one to make money.

2871
02:08:12,670 --> 02:08:14,860
They just want to start shit.
I think it's part.

2872
02:08:14,861 --> 02:08:19,861
I think it's part of the agenda.
I think this is what I think they feel 

2873
02:08:19,861 --> 02:08:23,860
like if there's an enemy out there and 
the enemy is the new president,

2874
02:08:24,070 --> 02:08:29,070
they think there's an enemy and they 
feel like they're going to war with the 

2875
02:08:29,070 --> 02:08:31,321
enemy and when you have a bunch of 
soldiers that are going to war for the 

2876
02:08:31,321 --> 02:08:33,010
enemy,
some of them do some unscrupulous shit.

2877
02:08:33,100 --> 02:08:38,100
Like these people that got.
They had to resign because the story 

2878
02:08:38,100 --> 02:08:39,670
with Russia with the fake facts.
I forget what the actual thing was,

2879
02:08:39,671 --> 02:08:43,650
but CNN disavowed their article,
pulled it down,

2880
02:08:43,660 --> 02:08:48,660
removed it whole deal.
Three journalists leaving CNN after 

2881
02:08:48,660 --> 02:08:49,360
retracted article.
CNN journalists,

2882
02:08:49,361 --> 02:08:52,840
including the executive editor in charge
of a new investigative unit,

2883
02:08:52,930 --> 02:08:55,650
have resigned after the publication of a
Russia,

2884
02:08:55,720 --> 02:08:58,420
Russia related article that was 
retracted.

2885
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:01,210
So you can go into details as you wanted
it.

2886
02:09:01,270 --> 02:09:02,710
You know what?
What if.

2887
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:07,660
What if the CNN Donald Trump feud is 
like pro wrestling?

2888
02:09:07,870 --> 02:09:12,870
What if they're just laughing and 
they're just slinging shit back and 

2889
02:09:12,870 --> 02:09:15,811
forth talking to a guy the other day 
that thinks that he thinks it's all 

2890
02:09:15,811 --> 02:09:15,820
about setting up China,
he said said,

2891
02:09:15,821 --> 02:09:18,940
it's all about us going to war these 
other countries.

2892
02:09:19,660 --> 02:09:22,270
He thinks there's all these distractions
are happening and that's what's.

2893
02:09:22,420 --> 02:09:27,420
And positioning North Korea and China on
the side of North Korea and you know 

2894
02:09:27,420 --> 02:09:27,550
it's crazy by North Korea,
the most.

2895
02:09:27,560 --> 02:09:29,800
They're the most demonized country on 
the planet.

2896
02:09:29,801 --> 02:09:34,801
Oh,
they're always testing missiles or 

2897
02:09:34,801 --> 02:09:34,801
testing,
miss it.

2898
02:09:34,801 --> 02:09:37,380
Since the Korean War.
You know how many countries they've 

2899
02:09:37,380 --> 02:09:38,380
invaded and killed innocent civilians?
Zero.

2900
02:09:38,590 --> 02:09:40,990
How many countries have we invaded and 
killed?

2901
02:09:40,991 --> 02:09:45,130
Millions of civilians like 20 or 30 
since the Korean War,

2902
02:09:45,430 --> 02:09:48,400
but they're the bad guy.
They're the bad guy.

2903
02:09:48,460 --> 02:09:50,860
They're not invading anybody.
They've never invaded anybody.

2904
02:09:50,950 --> 02:09:55,090
We invade people all the fucking time 
and kill innocent children and come on,

2905
02:09:55,390 --> 02:09:59,530
this is a big show going on.
There's nothing that's true,

2906
02:09:59,531 --> 02:10:03,070
but it is a dictatorship.
Like what's a scary dictatorship?

2907
02:10:03,071 --> 02:10:04,440
They have no control.
No,

2908
02:10:04,441 --> 02:10:04,670
no,
no.

2909
02:10:04,690 --> 02:10:09,690
It's not.
It's not the people who have been there 

2910
02:10:09,690 --> 02:10:09,690
and studied it.
No one disagrees,

2911
02:10:09,690 --> 02:10:12,890
Eddie.
I think it's out of control at a prison 

2912
02:10:12,890 --> 02:10:12,890
country.
Yeah.

2913
02:10:12,890 --> 02:10:14,710
They're all in prison by the show.
I think it's,

2914
02:10:15,310 --> 02:10:17,800
there's no show and Eddie,
they do.

2915
02:10:17,860 --> 02:10:21,290
They do and it is scary,
but they're a minor league problem,

2916
02:10:21,291 --> 02:10:23,300
like in comparison to a lot of other 
problems that are in the line.

2917
02:10:23,420 --> 02:10:27,130
I don't believe that because CNN pushes 
it so everybody approaches it.

2918
02:10:27,140 --> 02:10:32,140
Eddie,
I think there's no one out there that's 

2919
02:10:32,140 --> 02:10:32,140
saying that North Korea is not a 
military threat.

2920
02:10:32,140 --> 02:10:33,190
Are there not some sort of a military 
dictatorship?

2921
02:10:33,230 --> 02:10:34,250
I think it's a distraction

2922
02:10:34,380 --> 02:10:39,380
thing on it.
I don't think there's that many people 

2923
02:10:39,380 --> 02:10:40,840
out there and never invaded anybody.
We've invaded the country,

2924
02:10:40,860 --> 02:10:45,140
but this guy's still a psychopath that's
running this whole country in 2017.

2925
02:10:45,380 --> 02:10:49,520
That scares the fuck out of psychopath.
So we got a lot of people did Michael.

2926
02:10:49,521 --> 02:10:51,680
Malice does.
He's an author that I had on the podcast

2927
02:10:51,681 --> 02:10:53,210
that wrote a book about Kim Jong.
Uhm,

2928
02:10:53,690 --> 02:10:56,130
and you know,
he was describing was a una ill,

2929
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:59,060
ill isn't a new guy.
No,

2930
02:10:59,260 --> 02:11:01,430
that's the young guy,
Kim.

2931
02:11:01,490 --> 02:11:03,920
Kim Jong Un is the dad,
the dad.

2932
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:06,860
The Dad is the kid.
The new one.

2933
02:11:06,890 --> 02:11:07,590
The new one.
Okay,

2934
02:11:07,690 --> 02:11:10,760
so that was Kim Jong Il,
but it's called dear reader.

2935
02:11:10,900 --> 02:11:15,900
It's a very,
very good book and interesting to find 

2936
02:11:15,900 --> 02:11:18,521
out how fucked up it is over there.
It's a system that's set up so that 

2937
02:11:18,521 --> 02:11:19,880
everybody's in prison by it.
Everybody tells on everybody else,

2938
02:11:20,240 --> 02:11:25,240
like their setup to tell on each other,
like the people that have escaped and 

2939
02:11:25,240 --> 02:11:28,910
they've left and gone to South Korea and
they'll tell the stories about the 

2940
02:11:28,910 --> 02:11:28,910
prison camps.

2941
02:11:28,910 --> 02:11:29,730
People are born in prison camps over 
there.

2942
02:11:29,740 --> 02:11:31,670
Eddie,
I think their prisoner actors.

2943
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:32,690
Oh,
come on,

2944
02:11:32,691 --> 02:11:35,900
Jesus.
I don't get mad because I say that.

2945
02:11:35,901 --> 02:11:40,901
Why am I going to get killed for saying 
a whole group of the whole country's a 

2946
02:11:40,901 --> 02:11:44,831
bunch of actors to getting a check.
I think the presenters and they're 

2947
02:11:44,831 --> 02:11:44,831
forced to do parades.
Yeah,

2948
02:11:44,831 --> 02:11:46,340
they're definitely prisoners.
They definitely forced to pray.

2949
02:11:46,341 --> 02:11:47,050
Exactly.
Yeah,

2950
02:11:47,060 --> 02:11:48,950
like the whole country's a prison.
That's what I'm saying.

2951
02:11:48,951 --> 02:11:49,790
That's what I'm.
That's what I said,

2952
02:11:49,791 --> 02:11:52,460
but they're not actors acting when 
they're being filmed.

2953
02:11:52,461 --> 02:11:54,020
The guys,
they're acting.

2954
02:11:54,170 --> 02:11:56,870
They're not real.
They're not being sincere.

2955
02:11:56,871 --> 02:11:58,970
They're acting.
They're forced to act the prisoners.

2956
02:11:59,480 --> 02:12:04,480
But wait a minute,
do you think that this country is under 

2957
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:07,301
the control of a military dictatorship 
and everyone's terrified of doing 

2958
02:12:07,301 --> 02:12:07,340
anything wrong?
You think that.

2959
02:12:07,341 --> 02:12:09,380
Okay,
so you think that.

2960
02:12:10,180 --> 02:12:11,510
What do you mean by they're acting 
though?

2961
02:12:11,540 --> 02:12:12,800
There's.
They're all terrified.

2962
02:12:13,430 --> 02:12:15,660
Like how are they acting?
In what way they're.

2963
02:12:15,670 --> 02:12:19,220
They're acting like they're in love with
Kim Jong.

2964
02:12:19,760 --> 02:12:20,630
Terrified.
Yeah.

2965
02:12:20,631 --> 02:12:21,490
They all do that.
That's,

2966
02:12:21,670 --> 02:12:23,630
that's they.
They were arrested.

2967
02:12:23,631 --> 02:12:28,631
They went to jail.
A bunch of people did for not crying 

2968
02:12:28,631 --> 02:12:31,361
hard enough when his dad died.
Not crying hard enough like people did 

2969
02:12:31,731 --> 02:12:34,520
like six months of hardly come up with 
all that shit.

2970
02:12:35,510 --> 02:12:38,150
He got a haircut and he made everyone 
get the same haircut.

2971
02:12:38,630 --> 02:12:39,630
Look into that.
That's.

2972
02:12:41,350 --> 02:12:44,030
Yeah,
that's a fake story that everyone thinks

2973
02:12:44,031 --> 02:12:49,031
is true,
that he got a haircut and he made every 

2974
02:12:49,031 --> 02:12:50,600
man in the country get a haircut or they
get killed or something or get thrown in

2975
02:12:50,601 --> 02:12:51,920
prison.
I never saw that you.

2976
02:12:52,420 --> 02:12:57,420
It's bullshit.
Maybe did maybe that gangster high top 

2977
02:12:57,420 --> 02:13:01,010
fade or die because motherfuckers don't 
like high top fade or die.

2978
02:13:01,160 --> 02:13:01,850
They don't have shit.

2979
02:13:01,850 --> 02:13:04,220
What do you mean they don't have nuclear
weapons?

2980
02:13:04,460 --> 02:13:05,810
You don't think so?
Well,

2981
02:13:05,870 --> 02:13:08,540
let's just bring you to a Washington DC 
and clean this up.

2982
02:13:08,590 --> 02:13:09,560
That's.
I'm just,

2983
02:13:09,980 --> 02:13:11,070
I don't believe Shit.
You know,

2984
02:13:11,450 --> 02:13:13,640
robin,
trillions of dollars I think.

2985
02:13:13,910 --> 02:13:18,910
I think you should not believe in 
anything coming from the mainstream 

2986
02:13:18,910 --> 02:13:18,910
media.
Anything.

2987
02:13:18,910 --> 02:13:20,660
If they're all pushing it,
then it can't be the truth.

2988
02:13:21,390 --> 02:13:26,390
North Korea themselves.
I mean they definitely launched a 

2989
02:13:26,390 --> 02:13:28,871
missile.
The missile they launched yesterday say 

2990
02:13:28,871 --> 02:13:28,871
they don't believe it.
No.

2991
02:13:28,871 --> 02:13:29,550
Who's they?
That's what they said.

2992
02:13:29,570 --> 02:13:31,550
That Fox News.
Everybody.

2993
02:13:31,930 --> 02:13:33,300
They're all.
It's all mainstream media.

2994
02:13:33,420 --> 02:13:35,790
So do you think they're all in on it?
I think it's a distraction.

2995
02:13:35,791 --> 02:13:40,791
I think there's some serious shit going 
on in Washington DC and they need that 

2996
02:13:40,791 --> 02:13:40,791
shit.
Oh,

2997
02:13:40,791 --> 02:13:44,280
they're there.
They're sending out missiles again and 

2998
02:13:44,280 --> 02:13:44,280
everyone's afraid of world war three.
It's two gangs.

2999
02:13:45,480 --> 02:13:50,480
Not Anybody.
We've invaded 30 countries or 20 or 30 

3000
02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:50,760
countries since the Korean War.

3001
02:13:50,850 --> 02:13:55,850
We've killed millions of innocent people
on some bullshit ass wars and we're 

3002
02:13:55,850 --> 02:13:58,010
worried about North Korea.
That's ridiculous.

3003
02:13:58,020 --> 02:13:58,950
True.
But again,

3004
02:13:58,951 --> 02:14:03,951
that we're brainwashed,
or maybe they are a military 

3005
02:14:03,951 --> 02:14:05,820
dictatorship with nuclear power.
I'm very suspect experts.

3006
02:14:05,850 --> 02:14:09,300
Latest North Korean missile could strike
Boston in New York City.

3007
02:14:09,540 --> 02:14:11,010
Eddie Bravo.
Skeptical.

3008
02:14:11,011 --> 02:14:12,360
Hippo face.
I mean,

3009
02:14:12,590 --> 02:14:14,310
this is a trap,
man.

3010
02:14:15,400 --> 02:14:16,930
Got a beautiful haircut though.
Look at that.

3011
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Sweet.
Did you know in the Korean War we made 

3012
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:22,630
this mainstream news?
We made 18 cities disappearing.

3013
02:14:23,350 --> 02:14:24,700
It was horrible.
What they did,

3014
02:14:24,970 --> 02:14:29,970
they made the Soviets get the fuck out.
The Soviets left and and after the 

3015
02:14:30,900 --> 02:14:32,940
Korean War,
the United States was like,

3016
02:14:32,941 --> 02:14:34,830
what are we going to do with that?
China says we'll take over.

3017
02:14:34,890 --> 02:14:37,830
So since the Korean War,
it hasn't been officially Soviets.

3018
02:14:37,831 --> 02:14:40,860
The Soviets officially left and then 
China took over.

3019
02:14:40,920 --> 02:14:43,860
They kind of manage it and govern it.
I think it does.

3020
02:14:43,890 --> 02:14:47,280
I think it's just like a little prison 
country that they use to.

3021
02:14:47,400 --> 02:14:49,200
They used as the bad guy.
I think.

3022
02:14:49,620 --> 02:14:52,800
I wouldn't be surprised if Kim junk 
doesn't even live in Korea.

3023
02:14:53,670 --> 02:14:55,300
Just all Hologram does.
It.

3024
02:14:55,301 --> 02:14:58,170
Just take videos,
if you watch the videos easily faked,

3025
02:14:58,230 --> 02:15:00,180
easily fit.
There is no proof of anything.

3026
02:15:00,540 --> 02:15:01,950
There's no proof of shit.
You're right.

3027
02:15:02,220 --> 02:15:04,320
They're showing video,
but missile going up.

3028
02:15:04,350 --> 02:15:09,350
Oh,
I believe that after they still in 

3029
02:15:09,350 --> 02:15:10,230
trillions of dollars,
we we shouldn't believe shed a smart man

3030
02:15:10,231 --> 02:15:14,340
wouldn't believe shit that the missiles 
that are getting launched in the area.

3031
02:15:14,370 --> 02:15:17,610
So all the people like missiles,
missiles say that.

3032
02:15:18,130 --> 02:15:23,130
I didn't say so.
That's why I assume they don't have 

3033
02:15:23,130 --> 02:15:23,130
missiles.
If we thought they.

3034
02:15:23,130 --> 02:15:24,000
I'm talking about.
I'm talking about North Korea.

3035
02:15:24,001 --> 02:15:26,610
They have missiles.
That's what they tell you,

3036
02:15:26,730 --> 02:15:28,620
that the Russians and the Russian sell 
them shit.

3037
02:15:29,080 --> 02:15:31,620
That's what the Chinese,
the Russians,

3038
02:15:31,860 --> 02:15:34,620
everything.
They say they who's they?

3039
02:15:34,830 --> 02:15:38,300
The same people that stole the trillions
of dollars,

3040
02:15:38,301 --> 02:15:40,970
stole the trillions are also running CNN
thing.

3041
02:15:41,010 --> 02:15:42,930
It's all connected.
It's all connected.

3042
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:44,340
Definitely that.
That's the truth.

3043
02:15:44,740 --> 02:15:46,530
They are all connected.
There's.

3044
02:15:46,620 --> 02:15:51,620
I don't think you can have everything 
connected if they're going back and 

3045
02:15:51,620 --> 02:15:51,620
forth with each other.
Like,

3046
02:15:51,620 --> 02:15:52,440
look what's happening in between Fox 
News and CNN,

3047
02:15:52,650 --> 02:15:53,290
right?
Look at,

3048
02:15:53,430 --> 02:15:54,480
look at.
Look at the,

3049
02:15:54,481 --> 02:15:54,750
the,
the,

3050
02:15:54,751 --> 02:15:58,250
the internal battery gets fake.
Wow.

3051
02:15:58,290 --> 02:16:03,290
He was a Republican and Democrats.
It's a fake fucking and not really in 

3052
02:16:03,290 --> 02:16:05,010
competition with each other either.
They don't care who gets more ratings,

3053
02:16:05,011 --> 02:16:07,170
more money individually.
Individually.

3054
02:16:07,171 --> 02:16:09,570
People are worried about their own check
in their own family.

3055
02:16:09,690 --> 02:16:10,860
So individually,
yes,

3056
02:16:11,070 --> 02:16:16,070
but at the top it's just a show and I 
don't believe she had coming from them 

3057
02:16:16,070 --> 02:16:17,790
too much fake and six moon landings.
Come on,

3058
02:16:17,791 --> 02:16:18,660
let me,
let me ask you this.

3059
02:16:18,990 --> 02:16:20,970
Let me ask you this.
Where do you think.

3060
02:16:20,980 --> 02:16:25,980
Because one of the things that's 
happened for sure is as time has moved 

3061
02:16:25,980 --> 02:16:29,451
on,
as technology has gotten more and more 

3062
02:16:29,451 --> 02:16:30,010
powerful and the ability to do all the 
stuff that

3063
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:35,010
we can do now with our phones,
all the information that you can get 

3064
02:16:35,010 --> 02:16:37,471
like almost instantly with your phone,
like when is it going to reach a point 

3065
02:16:37,471 --> 02:16:40,891
where no one has any control over anyone
else because it seems to me that that's 

3066
02:16:40,891 --> 02:16:45,421
inevitable.
Seems to me that the idea of these big 

3067
02:16:45,421 --> 02:16:48,250
units of these big groups having control
over massive amounts of people.

3068
02:16:48,490 --> 02:16:53,490
I think at a certain point in time,
if technology keeps moving the way it 

3069
02:16:53,490 --> 02:16:57,121
is,
more and more people have more and more 

3070
02:16:57,121 --> 02:16:57,121
ability to communicate.
You're not gonna be able to hide things.

3071
02:16:57,690 --> 02:16:59,860
The daughter right now,
and I think we're going to reach a point

3072
02:16:59,861 --> 02:17:04,861
in time where they can't do that,
like they could do that so much easier 

3073
02:17:04,861 --> 02:17:04,861
in the sixties.
They could do anything in the sixties.

3074
02:17:04,861 --> 02:17:05,350
It was easy.
So

3075
02:17:05,770 --> 02:17:09,430
it was so easy to fake deaths in the 
sixties,

3076
02:17:09,431 --> 02:17:10,780
fifties,
fake everything.

3077
02:17:11,800 --> 02:17:13,180
It was so easy.
No one knew shit.

3078
02:17:13,320 --> 02:17:18,320
It was Jack Ruby runs up on Lee Harvey 
Oswald just shoots him in the guts in 

3079
02:17:18,320 --> 02:17:21,370
front of everybody.
Just let this guy run out him with a gun

3080
02:17:21,371 --> 02:17:23,230
in his hand.
They're bringing them in.

3081
02:17:23,500 --> 02:17:24,310
They got.
We've got,

3082
02:17:24,311 --> 02:17:25,360
um,
Lee Harvey Oswald.

3083
02:17:25,361 --> 02:17:25,950
We got um.
Oh,

3084
02:17:25,990 --> 02:17:27,370
what's that guy?
What's he doing?

3085
02:17:27,371 --> 02:17:28,480
Running our way?
Hey,

3086
02:17:28,481 --> 02:17:29,920
is that a gun?
Bang.

3087
02:17:30,190 --> 02:17:35,190
He just shoots him right in the stomach 
and meanwhile he's probably not even 

3088
02:17:35,190 --> 02:17:35,190
dead.
That looks so staged.

3089
02:17:35,190 --> 02:17:39,480
Maybe Lee Harvey Oswald.
They gotta do we gotta send you to an 

3090
02:17:39,480 --> 02:17:39,480
island while they shot that?
Dude,

3091
02:17:39,480 --> 02:17:40,840
you could see the bullet hit him,
shoots him right in the guts.

3092
02:17:41,080 --> 02:17:44,110
I think there's land that the elite have
that no one knows about.

3093
02:17:44,111 --> 02:17:45,790
Man.
That's what I think I would if I was the

3094
02:17:45,791 --> 02:17:47,110
elite,
how it ask some Shenandoah.

3095
02:17:47,140 --> 02:17:48,710
We don't need to tell these 
motherfuckers everything.

3096
02:17:48,820 --> 02:17:52,120
You think they think that the people 
running shit or like we need to tell the

3097
02:17:52,121 --> 02:17:54,350
people we need to.
They need to know they,

3098
02:17:54,480 --> 02:17:54,790
they,
they,

3099
02:17:54,870 --> 02:17:57,100
they have a right to know.
Clinton does.

3100
02:17:57,220 --> 02:18:01,450
Like most of his days think he's just 
got a bunch of chicks he calls up.

3101
02:18:02,700 --> 02:18:03,620
Hey,
I don't know.

3102
02:18:03,830 --> 02:18:08,830
I don't know.
But when you watch the stroke and the 

3103
02:18:08,830 --> 02:18:08,830
resistance,
there's a.

3104
02:18:08,830 --> 02:18:13,590
They may be bullshit,
but there's some was the Clinton 

3105
02:18:13,590 --> 02:18:15,631
chronicles.
The Clinton chronicles is a documentary 

3106
02:18:15,631 --> 02:18:18,331
made in the nineties that you could find
on youtube and it goes through his 

3107
02:18:18,331 --> 02:18:21,100
career in Arkansas and in the coke and 
all that stuff with the CIA.

3108
02:18:21,101 --> 02:18:22,330
MENA,
Arkansas.

3109
02:18:22,540 --> 02:18:23,410
Wow.
Well,

3110
02:18:23,620 --> 02:18:28,620
George,
senior vice president with Ronald 

3111
02:18:28,620 --> 02:18:28,620
Reagan,
the Contra.

3112
02:18:28,620 --> 02:18:30,130
All that Shit,
man.

3113
02:18:30,430 --> 02:18:32,770
There's a war on drugs.
That's a scam.

3114
02:18:32,771 --> 02:18:33,790
There's.
They're not trying to stop.

3115
02:18:33,790 --> 02:18:34,630
No.
God Damn drugs,

3116
02:18:34,631 --> 02:18:39,631
they'll bust the Mexican cartel here and
there just to just to say they're doing 

3117
02:18:39,631 --> 02:18:41,140
shit,
but they're taking all that money.

3118
02:18:41,141 --> 02:18:42,850
Then once again,
we need to fight this drug war.

3119
02:18:42,940 --> 02:18:47,940
They get all his fucking money.
Just you think that it's just like the 

3120
02:18:47,940 --> 02:18:47,940
moon and all the space?
Shit.

3121
02:18:47,940 --> 02:18:52,530
I just Bill Clinton's doing right now.
He's probably having a good time.

3122
02:18:53,130 --> 02:18:54,760
I think he's having.
Do you take to him?

3123
02:18:56,210 --> 02:18:59,050
I think he's having a fucking great time
right now to tell you the truth.

3124
02:18:59,051 --> 02:19:04,051
Do you think they got him set up today?
He's got like a sweet house and they 

3125
02:19:04,051 --> 02:19:04,051
bring them grapes and shit.
He lays down.

3126
02:19:04,051 --> 02:19:08,950
He's.
There's no one's ever going to buy this 

3127
02:19:08,950 --> 02:19:09,160
movie about Barry still coming out at 
the end of the summer.

3128
02:19:09,480 --> 02:19:14,380
American made five.
Going to be Tom Cruise and unreal.

3129
02:19:14,381 --> 02:19:15,610
Is this going to be?
Come on.

3130
02:19:15,611 --> 02:19:17,410
It's good propaganda film.
Huh?

3131
02:19:19,140 --> 02:19:21,700
It's not a felony if you're doing it for
the good guys.

3132
02:19:21,790 --> 02:19:23,760
Wow.
Yeah,

3133
02:19:24,020 --> 02:19:24,870
they're gonna.
They're gonna.

3134
02:19:24,880 --> 02:19:28,240
Make him look really bad one.
I wonder if Fensa

3135
02:19:29,100 --> 02:19:30,440
won't be able to just say,
hey,

3136
02:19:30,441 --> 02:19:32,210
this long time ago,
how can they make it look?

3137
02:19:32,510 --> 02:19:34,580
They're going to make it look like we 
don't do it anymore.

3138
02:19:34,910 --> 02:19:39,870
He was being sent a.
He was barry seal's was a pilot.

3139
02:19:40,200 --> 02:19:43,850
He was a trailer.
Tom Cruise looking sexy as ever.

3140
02:19:45,820 --> 02:19:47,490
Bad ass pile.
How does he stay?

3141
02:19:47,900 --> 02:19:52,900
He was a bad ass pilot.
He had his pilot's license at 15 and so 

3142
02:19:52,900 --> 02:19:53,720
the CIA recruited him.
That's mainstream.

3143
02:19:53,721 --> 02:19:56,180
They say I recruited him because he was 
a bad ass pilot.

3144
02:19:56,181 --> 02:19:56,920
Who?
Who?

3145
02:19:56,970 --> 02:19:58,560
This who was the trailer is really good.

3146
02:19:59,590 --> 02:20:04,590
Good.
That's he's covered in coke and he gets 

3147
02:20:04,590 --> 02:20:04,590
out of a fucking plane.
Covered in coke,

3148
02:20:04,590 --> 02:20:06,880
steals a kid's bike.
Wow.

3149
02:20:06,881 --> 02:20:10,550
He crashed rounds at a plain film.
How does Tom Cruise Day looking?

3150
02:20:10,580 --> 02:20:13,030
Thirty five.
What is he doing?

3151
02:20:13,300 --> 02:20:15,070
His scientologists,
but what are they doing?

3152
02:20:15,190 --> 02:20:20,190
Are they doing maybe blood.
They like running like those little a 

3153
02:20:20,190 --> 02:20:22,750
cotton gin looking things over his face.
Have you heard?

3154
02:20:22,990 --> 02:20:26,020
Have you heard someone Europe?
This could be bullshit.

3155
02:20:26,200 --> 02:20:26,680
Oh no,

3156
02:20:27,320 --> 02:20:31,500
but people like teens that they donate 
blood.

3157
02:20:32,310 --> 02:20:36,450
Old people are buying young blood and 
getting transfusions.

3158
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:42,280
Europe,
it's here in silicone valley or they're 

3159
02:20:42,280 --> 02:20:42,500
doing it for real.
You who's a famous billionaire?

3160
02:20:42,560 --> 02:20:47,560
Tell me about that.
What do you know are they found that if 

3161
02:20:47,560 --> 02:20:50,711
you inject young mice with the or old 
mice rather with the blood of young 

3162
02:20:50,931 --> 02:20:53,780
mice,
it makes them act like a young mouse.

3163
02:20:53,830 --> 02:20:56,270
It's just the way they hit for 
Millennia.

3164
02:20:56,330 --> 02:20:57,250
Well,
it sounds like vampires.

3165
02:20:57,251 --> 02:20:58,490
Shit.
Forget about Illuminati.

3166
02:20:58,620 --> 02:21:02,210
Sounds like vampire stuff.
Elizabeth Elizabeth bathory stuff.

3167
02:21:02,420 --> 02:21:03,440
So they,
um,

3168
02:21:03,710 --> 02:21:08,710
they are doing this now where they take 
like these young healthy guys and they 

3169
02:21:08,710 --> 02:21:13,271
donate blood and then you go there and 
they take that blood and pump it into 

3170
02:21:13,271 --> 02:21:15,230
your system and they fill your body up 
with young blood.

3171
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:20,280
It does it work.
Apparently it has some crazy like 

3172
02:21:20,280 --> 02:21:21,890
rejuvenating effect on you.
So let me ask you this.

3173
02:21:21,940 --> 02:21:22,190
Okay?

3174
02:21:23,010 --> 02:21:28,010
People,
people freak out when you say the 

3175
02:21:28,010 --> 02:21:31,971
Illuminati.
They're kidnapping kids and torturing 

3176
02:21:31,971 --> 02:21:32,460
babies and they want,
they want it.

3177
02:21:32,580 --> 02:21:35,340
They want to scare the shit out of them 
because they want adrenaline's blood and

3178
02:21:35,341 --> 02:21:37,380
they're poking holes all over analyze 
blood.

3179
02:21:37,440 --> 02:21:39,220
Apparently.
If you scare the shit out of him,

3180
02:21:39,290 --> 02:21:44,290
the the adrenal gland flushes into this 
is what they do.

3181
02:21:45,870 --> 02:21:47,130
I have.
Can I just talk?

3182
02:21:48,120 --> 02:21:50,160
I don't know if it's real.
I don't know if it's real,

3183
02:21:50,340 --> 02:21:54,030
but apparently adrenalize blood is the 
most potent,

3184
02:21:54,150 --> 02:21:56,980
so they scare the kids and they kill him
and suck.

3185
02:21:57,050 --> 02:22:00,180
Either they drink their blood.
That's a conspiracy theory.

3186
02:22:00,270 --> 02:22:04,470
That's a conspiracy theory,
but we're already seeing this with.

3187
02:22:04,630 --> 02:22:07,180
We're being well being.
Slowly get.

3188
02:22:07,750 --> 02:22:10,590
If the blood is good for you,
for old people,

3189
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:14,580
I bet some billionaire is going to go.
What about booking toddler blood?

3190
02:22:15,180 --> 02:22:17,790
What about that shit?
What about newborn baby blood?

3191
02:22:17,940 --> 02:22:20,000
I bet they're thinking.
Think about

3192
02:22:20,050 --> 02:22:21,820
stem cells.
Thing about stem cells.

3193
02:22:21,821 --> 02:22:26,821
Getting placental stem cells would think
about all the kidnaps or embryotic 

3194
02:22:26,821 --> 02:22:29,310
700,000
to a million kidnaps a year,

3195
02:22:29,670 --> 02:22:34,670
so I think they're just taking babies 
and using them to make rich people stay 

3196
02:22:34,670 --> 02:22:37,791
alive forever.
What if you were rich and fucking 

3197
02:22:37,791 --> 02:22:37,980
psychopath kid you do that?
We'll let you do that.

3198
02:22:38,040 --> 02:22:43,040
We can use crispr to artificially 
engineered a bunch of headless kids and 

3199
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:45,150
you take the blood out of them.
Didn't even know you got it.

3200
02:22:45,750 --> 02:22:48,810
Blood is working right.
Don't want you to think baby blood would

3201
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:50,070
be.
It wouldn't be a shock.

3202
02:22:50,071 --> 02:22:52,200
Or if you found out that baby blood is 
the best,

3203
02:22:52,240 --> 02:22:54,150
right you this,
would that be a shock?

3204
02:22:54,180 --> 02:22:58,110
Is it immoral to have a warehouse filled
with headless fake kids?

3205
02:22:58,410 --> 02:23:00,430
They don't have any head.
They never did have a hat.

3206
02:23:00,450 --> 02:23:05,450
They were engineered with Crispr to have
no head and you have them hooked up to 

3207
02:23:05,450 --> 02:23:09,081
this thing and there's still some blood 
into these vats and you go there and 

3208
02:23:09,081 --> 02:23:13,551
they tap you and you have to like look 
up and recognize that these artificial 

3209
02:23:13,551 --> 02:23:13,710
people got to be real blood.

3210
02:23:13,900 --> 02:23:15,330
If blood,
they're real people,

3211
02:23:15,331 --> 02:23:18,330
they just don't have any heads.
So they never have a chance to be alive.

3212
02:23:18,331 --> 02:23:20,910
They're connected to some machine.
Is this a movie?

3213
02:23:21,270 --> 02:23:22,260
Uh,
no.

3214
02:23:22,350 --> 02:23:25,080
Probably.
It's kind of like the Matrix,

3215
02:23:25,081 --> 02:23:26,880
right?
Kind of like the Matrix but,

3216
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:32,000
but,
but we already know teen blood is 

3217
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,340
helping old people.
I think it's 25 year olds is what they 

3218
02:23:34,340 --> 02:23:37,131
said for an adult with based on the fact
that teen blood is better than getting 

3219
02:23:37,171 --> 02:23:38,430
like a 50 year old black.
Right?

3220
02:23:38,700 --> 02:23:39,570
Right.
Yes.

3221
02:23:39,571 --> 02:23:44,571
So that's what they're saying.
Toddler blood would be better than team 

3222
02:23:44,571 --> 02:23:44,571
black.
Well,

3223
02:23:44,571 --> 02:23:45,690
here's the other thing.
Maybe you're right.

3224
02:23:45,900 --> 02:23:47,010
Here's the other thing that goes the 
other way,

3225
02:23:47,011 --> 02:23:50,130
which is even more fascinating.
They took the blood of old mice and they

3226
02:23:50,131 --> 02:23:53,490
put it into to the young mice and the 
young man started acting old,

3227
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:56,880
which is kind of fucked.
Wow.

3228
02:23:57,160 --> 02:24:00,240
Like there's something in the blood and 
they're trying to isolate what it is.

3229
02:24:00,241 --> 02:24:03,060
Of course,
like it just makes sense.

3230
02:24:03,061 --> 02:24:04,220
It's easy to believe like,
yeah,

3231
02:24:04,230 --> 02:24:06,810
young blood is probably better than old 
blood.

3232
02:24:06,920 --> 02:24:08,250
Yeah.
It's probably better.

3233
02:24:08,350 --> 02:24:10,290
Yeah,
and that's where everything comes from.

3234
02:24:10,291 --> 02:24:13,250
It comes from the blood.
Everything could blood is this.

3235
02:24:13,560 --> 02:24:15,960
Cannabis reverses aging process in the 
brain.

3236
02:24:15,961 --> 02:24:20,070
Studies suggest researchers restore the 
memory performance of Methuselah,

3237
02:24:21,240 --> 02:24:26,220
methuselah mice to a juvenile stage.
Whoa.

3238
02:24:26,700 --> 02:24:29,190
Regressed to a two month old.
Whoa.

3239
02:24:29,550 --> 02:24:31,830
Using a cannabis active ingredient.

3240
02:24:32,750 --> 02:24:33,170
Whoa.

3241
02:24:34,370 --> 02:24:35,810
Interesting.
That's crazy.

3242
02:24:36,740 --> 02:24:40,310
Treatment opens up new options when it 
comes to treating dementia.

3243
02:24:40,610 --> 02:24:42,890
Now imagine if we read was what you 
needed.

3244
02:24:43,130 --> 02:24:45,590
I just hardcore edibles.
We need to act.

3245
02:24:45,650 --> 02:24:48,050
Ask Joey some questions.
He does have some stories.

3246
02:24:48,060 --> 02:24:53,060
We know for a fact that cannabis 
basically like 90 percent cure seizures 

3247
02:24:54,471 --> 02:24:58,700
and kids and and even in animals,
a dog dogs that have seizures.

3248
02:24:58,850 --> 02:25:01,580
You give him some cannabis oil,
but let me ask you this,

3249
02:25:01,760 --> 02:25:03,950
why does it fuck with your memory?
How come when we're high?

3250
02:25:03,951 --> 02:25:05,390
We're like,
what the fuck was I just talking about?

3251
02:25:05,480 --> 02:25:09,270
My theory is this.
It's like there's a difference between a

3252
02:25:09,500 --> 02:25:13,790
forgetting something and misplacing 
something.

3253
02:25:13,910 --> 02:25:17,660
Like when you go out to vegas and you 
get hammered and you black out,

3254
02:25:18,050 --> 02:25:23,050
there's no way someone's going to say 
anything to you that's going to make 

3255
02:25:23,050 --> 02:25:24,310
that memory come back of this or that.

3256
02:25:24,330 --> 02:25:25,030
They can say,
dude,

3257
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:30,120
and then you grow and then you grabbed 
her and then you picked her up and then 

3258
02:25:30,120 --> 02:25:30,120
you told to get the fuck out of here and
you're like,

3259
02:25:30,120 --> 02:25:30,190
dude,
I don't remember any of that.

3260
02:25:30,340 --> 02:25:35,340
You lost your memory.
Even them reminding you and telling you 

3261
02:25:35,340 --> 02:25:35,710
about what happened there.
You lost your memory,

3262
02:25:35,920 --> 02:25:38,610
but now when you're stone and you've got
all this shit going on,

3263
02:25:38,660 --> 02:25:39,390
there's,
you know,

3264
02:25:39,820 --> 02:25:43,060
we'd make blood rushes to your head so 
you've got so much shit going on.

3265
02:25:43,150 --> 02:25:46,000
Shit gets misplaced.
You forgot what you were talking about,

3266
02:25:46,120 --> 02:25:48,370
but if someone reminds you of what you 
were talking about,

3267
02:25:48,490 --> 02:25:49,060
you're like,
oh,

3268
02:25:49,061 --> 02:25:50,710
okay.
Then you're back on track.

3269
02:25:50,860 --> 02:25:54,010
You didn't eat any booze in that respect
because.

3270
02:25:54,160 --> 02:25:59,160
Well,
there's a difference between actually a 

3271
02:25:59,160 --> 02:25:59,770
forgetting something and not remembering
at all.

3272
02:25:59,860 --> 02:26:01,120
It just complete.
You did it.

3273
02:26:01,180 --> 02:26:01,780
You were drunk.

3274
02:26:01,810 --> 02:26:03,190
You did it.
You don't remember it.

3275
02:26:03,390 --> 02:26:05,560
There's nothing anybody can do to bring 
it back.

3276
02:26:05,590 --> 02:26:07,690
They can tell you all about it.
You could watch it on video.

3277
02:26:07,810 --> 02:26:12,810
It ain't coming back.
Maybe the memory of you watching the 

3278
02:26:12,810 --> 02:26:12,810
video will,
will,

3279
02:26:12,810 --> 02:26:12,810
will,
will stay in your brain,

3280
02:26:12,810 --> 02:26:15,570
but no memories of.
It's never coming back with weed.

3281
02:26:15,910 --> 02:26:18,220
You're talking about all this shit 
you're going to have.

3282
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:23,240
It's you start,
you start digressing and moving to this 

3283
02:26:23,240 --> 02:26:23,240
and jumping all over the place and go,
what did I just say?

3284
02:26:23,560 --> 02:26:25,390
If someone reminded you,
it'll come back.

3285
02:26:25,391 --> 02:26:26,080
It wasn't like,
man,

3286
02:26:26,081 --> 02:26:27,550
I don't remember ever talking about 
that.

3287
02:26:27,551 --> 02:26:28,720
You were just talking about that.
No,

3288
02:26:28,721 --> 02:26:30,250
I don't remember that.
So it's different.

3289
02:26:30,260 --> 02:26:35,260
Well,
I forget sometimes when I'm talking 

3290
02:26:35,260 --> 02:26:35,260
about,
but I don't feel yet.

3291
02:26:35,260 --> 02:26:36,340
Moments or instances or facts.
If you were blackout drunk,

3292
02:26:36,341 --> 02:26:38,460
you were a couple of times.

3293
02:26:39,190 --> 02:26:40,200
Hey Man.
Coffees,

3294
02:26:40,220 --> 02:26:41,370
those little things.
Yeah.

3295
02:26:41,380 --> 02:26:44,260
Everybody has gotten those moments 
where.

3296
02:26:44,360 --> 02:26:49,360
Lockout,
where or just when you know that like 

3297
02:26:49,360 --> 02:26:49,920
you're not seeing things the way other 
people are seeing them.

3298
02:26:50,170 --> 02:26:55,170
Like where are like,
that's why I don't understand how 

3299
02:26:55,170 --> 02:26:57,010
anybody could do like,
like ketamine,

3300
02:26:57,160 --> 02:26:59,800
like people that do like recreational 
ketamine never done it.

3301
02:26:59,950 --> 02:27:01,540
Never done it either.
But it's scary.

3302
02:27:01,541 --> 02:27:03,700
You go into that k hole that they talk 
about.

3303
02:27:03,940 --> 02:27:05,590
Sound good?
Doesn't sound good.

3304
02:27:06,180 --> 02:27:08,200
That doesn't sound good to me.
I don't want to do that.

3305
02:27:08,201 --> 02:27:10,390
It's some sort of animal tranquilizer,
right?

3306
02:27:10,780 --> 02:27:12,410
Something.
Thanks Bro.

3307
02:27:13,470 --> 02:27:15,480
What is it?
What is it?

3308
02:27:15,490 --> 02:27:18,310
Um,
what was it called?

3309
02:27:18,311 --> 02:27:22,270
K Hole,
if it was called a wonder lust,

3310
02:27:22,840 --> 02:27:25,330
if something was called Wanderlust,
I'd be like,

3311
02:27:25,570 --> 02:27:26,590
let me draw it.
Yeah,

3312
02:27:26,591 --> 02:27:28,570
but they call it a k hole after they've 
been in it.

3313
02:27:28,690 --> 02:27:30,010
Yeah,
it sounds horrible.

3314
02:27:30,400 --> 02:27:32,230
It sounds like darkness.
I don't want to go there.

3315
02:27:32,231 --> 02:27:36,150
I never had the desire to do something 
that was going to put you in a k hole.

3316
02:27:36,210 --> 02:27:37,870
Fuck that.
Like acid.

3317
02:27:37,930 --> 02:27:41,170
Not into it.
We did that acid podcast with jelly.

3318
02:27:41,730 --> 02:27:43,300
I didn't think I can go.
That was the only guy.

3319
02:27:43,301 --> 02:27:45,250
Not on acid,
but Ari was on acid.

3320
02:27:45,251 --> 02:27:49,750
Joey Lee.
It was fucking hysterical.

3321
02:27:49,970 --> 02:27:52,450
I was like,
you gotta change the name.

3322
02:27:52,451 --> 02:27:57,451
You can't call it acid.
I'm not going to take anything called 

3323
02:27:57,451 --> 02:27:57,451
acid.
That fucks me up.

3324
02:27:57,451 --> 02:27:58,250
That's hilarious.
And He.

3325
02:27:58,270 --> 02:28:03,270
They should've called it something else.
They should have solved if they just 

3326
02:28:03,270 --> 02:28:04,310
call it Cuti Love Qd love.
Yeah.

3327
02:28:04,400 --> 02:28:05,350
Yeah.
I'll take some qt.

3328
02:28:05,351 --> 02:28:06,670
Love.
What's it going to do?

3329
02:28:06,890 --> 02:28:11,890
Oh,
just make you look you so I'll with joey

3330
02:28:18,040 --> 02:28:19,870
would drop some math.
You don't give a fuck man.

3331
02:28:19,900 --> 02:28:20,880
Yeah.
Joey's.

3332
02:28:20,930 --> 02:28:25,200
He's downtown gangster.
That's the yelling and everywhere to joe

3333
02:28:25,201 --> 02:28:26,270
has been doing a lot of travel.

3334
02:28:26,270 --> 02:28:28,670
He just sold out the Borgata casino in 
Atlantic city.

3335
02:28:30,020 --> 02:28:31,100
That's not.
Yeah.

3336
02:28:31,101 --> 02:28:34,460
He wanted to come in and do a podcast to
promote it and he's like,

3337
02:28:34,461 --> 02:28:36,380
I don't even got to promote a dog hits 
already.

3338
02:28:36,381 --> 02:28:40,190
Sold the fuck out.
Everybody's killing it.

3339
02:28:40,280 --> 02:28:43,370
It's Kinda crazy.
Crazy to see how uh,

3340
02:28:43,430 --> 02:28:47,600
how hard they're killing it on the road.
Shows podcasts,

3341
02:28:47,630 --> 02:28:49,100
killing it too.
Then the comedy store,

3342
02:28:49,101 --> 02:28:54,101
Holy Shit.
That's back in the day.

3343
02:28:54,620 --> 02:28:58,880
They had so many like hidden bars back 
there that collected dust,

3344
02:28:58,881 --> 02:29:03,881
spider webs everywhere.
Now all those back rooms are being used 

3345
02:29:03,881 --> 02:29:03,881
like the old days.
It's insane.

3346
02:29:04,160 --> 02:29:09,160
I've never,
I mean I was hanging out at the comedy 

3347
02:29:09,160 --> 02:29:10,310
store all the Goddamn time with you for 
like two or three years straight.

3348
02:29:10,390 --> 02:29:14,040
You come pick me up man.
I come out your car,

3349
02:29:14,060 --> 02:29:19,060
but either like,
like the baddest car on the planet is 

3350
02:29:19,060 --> 02:29:19,060
like just waiting for me.

3351
02:29:19,060 --> 02:29:20,570
I'm out front.
And those moments,

3352
02:29:20,720 --> 02:29:24,050
you know,
the reason I bring that up is last night

3353
02:29:24,051 --> 02:29:29,051
after Ebi,
me and my wife drove through my 

3354
02:29:29,051 --> 02:29:29,090
neighborhood and we went down my street.
I got out of my car,

3355
02:29:29,120 --> 02:29:30,710
I parked right in front of my house and 
I got on my car.

3356
02:29:30,711 --> 02:29:32,630
I just wanted to look at it again.
I mean,

3357
02:29:32,631 --> 02:29:37,631
I was there for like 15 years and when I
turned around and walked back to the 

3358
02:29:37,631 --> 02:29:40,310
car,
dude and I went back to 2001 where you'd

3359
02:29:40,311 --> 02:29:42,410
come and pick me up and we drive to the 
comedy store.

3360
02:29:42,411 --> 02:29:43,730
Dude,
I had that vision.

3361
02:29:43,731 --> 02:29:44,900
I was just last night,
man.

3362
02:29:44,901 --> 02:29:45,390
It was,
it was,

3363
02:29:45,470 --> 02:29:50,470
it was insane.
It was crazy at that all the goddamn 

3364
02:29:50,470 --> 02:29:50,510
time.
And the comedy store the way it is now.

3365
02:29:50,511 --> 02:29:52,940
Holy Shit.
Tuesday night selling out,

3366
02:29:53,040 --> 02:29:54,860
it stays.
Fuck.

3367
02:29:55,010 --> 02:29:56,240
That sounded almost every night.

3368
02:29:56,240 --> 02:29:58,220
Sometimes there was a main room was 
rarely used.

3369
02:29:58,221 --> 02:30:00,500
It was just all about the alarm was 
struggling,

3370
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:05,800
it was struggling.
And then when you left and you had that 

3371
02:30:05,800 --> 02:30:06,680
falling out for for awhile,
then dude darkness.

3372
02:30:06,980 --> 02:30:08,900
And then you come back,
boom.

3373
02:30:08,970 --> 02:30:13,970
It's like,
it's like Jesus is doing stand up there 

3374
02:30:13,970 --> 02:30:13,970
now.
You know what I mean?

3375
02:30:13,970 --> 02:30:16,340
It's so packed and everyone loves it and
there's lines outside.

3376
02:30:16,341 --> 02:30:17,840
It's nuts.
It's weird.

3377
02:30:17,841 --> 02:30:19,820
Right?
It's weird to see because you get to see

3378
02:30:19,821 --> 02:30:22,100
it in the dark days.
You got to see it.

3379
02:30:22,101 --> 02:30:27,101
When I first started going down,
which we weren't getting a lot of 

3380
02:30:27,101 --> 02:30:27,101
crowds.
No,

3381
02:30:27,101 --> 02:30:27,101
just the.
Oh,

3382
02:30:27,101 --> 02:30:31,670
and it's rarely that.
It took like a few years of me going 

3383
02:30:31,670 --> 02:30:35,411
there,
selling out sellouts warrant happening 

3384
02:30:35,411 --> 02:30:35,411
back then.
Not many maybe of Dave Chappelle came by

3385
02:30:35,411 --> 02:30:40,361
and did like a sad or something.
Maybe another one talk or maybe on a 

3386
02:30:40,361 --> 02:30:40,910
Friday night it would sell out our 
Saturday night and the o are.

3387
02:30:41,030 --> 02:30:42,140
Yeah,
but just the lr.

3388
02:30:42,160 --> 02:30:43,500
Not like both of them.
Can,

3389
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:45,060
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

3390
02:30:45,250 --> 02:30:50,250
Yeah.
And now it's nuts and every but all the 

3391
02:30:50,250 --> 02:30:50,250
managers like,
hell yeah.

3392
02:30:50,250 --> 02:30:51,840
This is all an insane.
It's beautiful.

3393
02:30:51,890 --> 02:30:52,760
It's a beautiful thing,
man.

3394
02:30:52,910 --> 02:30:57,910
It's crazy.
It's the Internet to Internet and that 

3395
02:30:57,910 --> 02:31:01,211
opened the fucking place up.
It's always been a big for texts were 

3396
02:31:01,211 --> 02:31:02,630
crazy people to something.
That was something about that place.

3397
02:31:02,690 --> 02:31:06,250
That guy was there last week.
I'm Robert Apple.

3398
02:31:06,260 --> 02:31:10,910
Your mom provided his name?
Robert William App or via a lawyer.

3399
02:31:10,970 --> 02:31:13,790
I'd like to talk to him like,
you can't touch them.

3400
02:31:14,110 --> 02:31:15,430
You can't touch them.
You won't change.

3401
02:31:15,620 --> 02:31:16,880
What's the store like?
What does he say?

3402
02:31:17,020 --> 02:31:18,620
Is he a,
I don't know.

3403
02:31:18,680 --> 02:31:20,160
I mean asperger's.
He's got

3404
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:23,970
something going on.
There's some issues through some,

3405
02:31:23,971 --> 02:31:25,110
uh,
some sort of issue.

3406
02:31:25,470 --> 02:31:28,590
He walked the documentary right now 
getting into that.

3407
02:31:28,591 --> 02:31:33,591
Did you know that dude would do.
He would put on a jacket and then he 

3408
02:31:33,591 --> 02:31:38,031
would put,
he would stuff the jacket filled with 

3409
02:31:38,031 --> 02:31:40,191
plastic bags and walk in the rain.
He's like a sort of a homeless kind of 

3410
02:31:40,191 --> 02:31:44,541
comedian who shows up place where he 
sleeps and he's got a place and he's 

3411
02:31:44,541 --> 02:31:45,390
been at the comedy store every week 
forever,

3412
02:31:45,450 --> 02:31:46,470
every week.
And he's always on.

3413
02:31:46,500 --> 02:31:48,150
He's by himself.
No one usually talks to them.

3414
02:31:48,151 --> 02:31:51,620
Right.
It's kind of a nice guy and he's all.

3415
02:31:51,630 --> 02:31:54,750
His jokes are about marijuana.
Does he have good ones?

3416
02:31:55,020 --> 02:31:57,090
They're not bad.
They're not bad.

3417
02:31:57,210 --> 02:31:58,310
Oh,
so he's a super weed.

3418
02:31:58,311 --> 02:31:59,340
Got the.
Oh yeah,

3419
02:31:59,370 --> 02:32:01,510
it's all about weed.
Everything's relaxed about weed.

3420
02:32:01,780 --> 02:32:03,240
I didn't know that.
You didn't know that.

3421
02:32:03,240 --> 02:32:08,240
I didn't know that.
I never let his whole act is about 

3422
02:32:08,240 --> 02:32:08,240
marijuana.
What does he say?

3423
02:32:08,240 --> 02:32:08,240
Like,
Oh,

3424
02:32:08,400 --> 02:32:11,010
you don't have to go there and watch and
watch.

3425
02:32:11,011 --> 02:32:12,240
I wouldn't want to do as bits,
but yeah,

3426
02:32:12,241 --> 02:32:14,250
it's all about weed.
That's crazy.

3427
02:32:14,390 --> 02:32:15,780
I thought there's a lake.
He was a lawyer.

3428
02:32:15,930 --> 02:32:20,930
There's this documentary about this old 
lady who basically lives at a 

3429
02:32:21,421 --> 02:32:22,700
laundromat.
She just like,

3430
02:32:22,710 --> 02:32:27,710
just started hanging out there and super
nice and started doing people's laundry 

3431
02:32:27,710 --> 02:32:27,860
and like the owner of the laundromat 
just like,

3432
02:32:27,870 --> 02:32:28,850
let her live there.
You know,

3433
02:32:28,890 --> 02:32:31,540
she's just a homeless person.
She was really sweet.

3434
02:32:31,560 --> 02:32:32,390
Good.
She's a,

3435
02:32:32,520 --> 02:32:34,150
she's there all day.
Clean it up and watch.

3436
02:32:34,151 --> 02:32:34,590
He's like,
yeah,

3437
02:32:34,591 --> 02:32:36,140
I got free security.
She's nice.

3438
02:32:36,150 --> 02:32:37,950
I'm not going to throw her out.
And she's helping everybody.

3439
02:32:37,951 --> 02:32:39,690
Everybody loves her.
And then,

3440
02:32:39,691 --> 02:32:42,390
uh,
they did a documentary on what she,

3441
02:32:43,020 --> 02:32:44,790
her life.
It's pretty fascinating,

3442
02:32:44,791 --> 02:32:49,791
man.
I'm Zach Galifianakis take has been 

3443
02:32:49,791 --> 02:32:52,881
taken.
He's known her for years because she's 

3444
02:32:52,881 --> 02:32:53,400
like in Santa Monica and back when he 
was a struggling actor,

3445
02:32:53,460 --> 02:32:56,340
he met her at the laundromat and he 
became friends with her.

3446
02:32:56,520 --> 02:33:00,510
He takes her on red carpet.
Premiers as this date,

3447
02:33:02,240 --> 02:33:05,580
hooked her up there.
They have a really close relationship.

3448
02:33:05,690 --> 02:33:10,080
That's credit he takes.
He takes her to legit red carpet,

3449
02:33:10,170 --> 02:33:11,700
big ass movie premiers.

3450
02:33:13,860 --> 02:33:15,240
Zach's an interesting guy,
man.

3451
02:33:15,270 --> 02:33:17,310
He's real good friends with brody.
Really?

3452
02:33:17,790 --> 02:33:22,790
Brody was having some issues.
He reached out because he know I'm 

3453
02:33:22,790 --> 02:33:22,790
friends with brody and just telling me 
like,

3454
02:33:22,790 --> 02:33:24,900
Bro,
he's not doing so good right now.

3455
02:33:25,730 --> 02:33:28,520
Help out.
Try to keep an eye on him.

3456
02:33:28,630 --> 02:33:29,400
Don't,
don't do anything.

3457
02:33:29,401 --> 02:33:30,470
Nuts.
Really easy.

3458
02:33:30,500 --> 02:33:32,130
Uh,
he's not doing standup anymore.

3459
02:33:32,200 --> 02:33:35,230
What does this remind me of the story I 
just heard the other day?

3460
02:33:35,231 --> 02:33:37,450
So I'm looking at this video up.
It's not brand new,

3461
02:33:37,451 --> 02:33:42,451
which I thought it was brand new.
This lady was living in this guy's 

3462
02:33:42,451 --> 02:33:45,001
addict for a couple of,
I think a year and the way he found out 

3463
02:33:45,001 --> 02:33:48,100
as he put a camera in because he was 
finding food missing from his apartment.

3464
02:33:48,130 --> 02:33:53,130
Like in this kitchen,
this lady was living in his attic and 

3465
02:33:53,130 --> 02:33:53,130
climbing down when he was gone to like 
take it.

3466
02:33:53,310 --> 02:33:58,310
Shower food.
I think it was a year.

3467
02:33:59,251 --> 02:34:00,990
I want to say it might've been a little 
longer.

3468
02:34:00,991 --> 02:34:03,720
It could have been a little less like 54
years old.

3469
02:34:04,260 --> 02:34:06,870
This is like that movie,
like it was in New York.

3470
02:34:07,490 --> 02:34:11,680
We had this little stool there.
Starts with a P.

3471
02:34:11,680 --> 02:34:13,400
Whoa.
A poltergeist?

3472
02:34:13,550 --> 02:34:14,610
No,
no.

3473
02:34:14,611 --> 02:34:16,850
It's a paranormal activity.
Is that all?

3474
02:34:17,170 --> 02:34:17,950
This is crazy.

3475
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:21,100
It's good to be fake.
Look how quiet she.

3476
02:34:22,240 --> 02:34:27,240
So she doing this while he's asleep.
I think he was gone at work and she 

3477
02:34:27,240 --> 02:34:30,670
probably didn't want anybody to know 
that she's pissed in my sink.

3478
02:34:30,671 --> 02:34:33,720
What the fuck is it?
Videos.

3479
02:34:33,730 --> 02:34:35,110
Timelapse a little bit to some.
Skip it.

3480
02:34:35,140 --> 02:34:37,350
Oh my gosh.
She's sitting there and his dad,

3481
02:34:37,580 --> 02:34:38,920
his whole apartment that we're looking 
at.

3482
02:34:38,940 --> 02:34:43,940
Well this is just like this kitchen.
You just put like a still camera in 

3483
02:34:43,940 --> 02:34:46,471
there when he went to work to find out 
what happened in the middle of the night

3484
02:34:47,440 --> 02:34:50,830
to maybe,
Whoa,

3485
02:34:52,210 --> 02:34:52,470
hold on,

3486
02:34:52,590 --> 02:34:54,100
keep going with that.
Keep going.

3487
02:34:54,101 --> 02:34:55,980
That where is she?
How did she get up there?

3488
02:34:56,350 --> 02:34:58,140
Like she went back up?
Yeah,

3489
02:34:58,141 --> 02:34:59,490
exactly.
How does she get back up?

3490
02:34:59,550 --> 02:35:00,630
Yeah.
Where did she go?

3491
02:35:00,780 --> 02:35:01,410
That's him,
right?

3492
02:35:01,590 --> 02:35:03,360
That's him.
There she is.

3493
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:04,860
Okay.
So where does she go?

3494
02:35:06,260 --> 02:35:07,460
Did this guy to be fake?
No Way.

3495
02:35:07,461 --> 02:35:09,710
She could get up there.
Let's find out how she does it.

3496
02:35:09,800 --> 02:35:11,480
Oh Shit.
Oh Shit.

3497
02:35:11,960 --> 02:35:13,910
Oh.
She hears him coming in and she runs and

3498
02:35:13,911 --> 02:35:15,980
hides.
Oh Wow.

3499
02:35:16,010 --> 02:35:21,010
Yeah.
It might have been the middle of the 

3500
02:35:21,010 --> 02:35:21,010
night.
Oh my God.

3501
02:35:21,010 --> 02:35:23,160
He got up in the middle of the night.
She had a whole.

3502
02:35:23,750 --> 02:35:26,820
How is she going to get back?
How is she going to get back up there?

3503
02:35:26,870 --> 02:35:29,000
Been doing it every night,
but let's see it.

3504
02:35:29,030 --> 02:35:29,540
Let's see it

3505
02:35:30,110 --> 02:35:32,240
do.
That is insane.

3506
02:35:33,050 --> 02:35:36,510
So he leaves.
She comes back and that's it.

3507
02:35:39,410 --> 02:35:41,600
There's no shot of her going back.
It was just right there.

3508
02:35:42,020 --> 02:35:42,890
Okay,
let's see that.

3509
02:35:43,400 --> 02:35:46,880
Oh Shit.
It's real too.

3510
02:35:46,910 --> 02:35:49,760
She lives in his attic.
That's insane.

3511
02:35:50,180 --> 02:35:50,650
That's so

3512
02:35:50,740 --> 02:35:53,290
creepy.
Would say the next morning,

3513
02:35:53,650 --> 02:35:58,650
maybe the next morning.
Didn't I say that at the very end of 

3514
02:35:58,650 --> 02:35:58,650
that video?

3515
02:36:01,030 --> 02:36:04,800
Does it say a video?
How long has she was up there for

3516
02:36:05,850 --> 02:36:07,540
like how long had it been?
I don't know.

3517
02:36:07,640 --> 02:36:12,640
Was going back to the story.
So you get the rest go like right when 

3518
02:36:12,640 --> 02:36:12,640
she pops up,
go right back to that video please.

3519
02:36:12,780 --> 02:36:15,210
And right when she pops up into the 
attic area.

3520
02:36:15,540 --> 02:36:18,510
Go a little bit further back before when
she scrambles up.

3521
02:36:21,630 --> 02:36:23,340
Fine.
When she scrambles up in there.

3522
02:36:24,300 --> 02:36:27,280
I don't see it coming out the next 
morning.

3523
02:36:27,480 --> 02:36:28,140
Yeah.
Okay.

3524
02:36:28,141 --> 02:36:33,141
Him saw him the next morning.
And does he check the video and find 

3525
02:36:33,141 --> 02:36:35,430
out?
Fuck man,

3526
02:36:35,431 --> 02:36:40,431
you know creepy.
That would be of your sleeping in the 

3527
02:36:40,431 --> 02:36:40,431
house and someone's in your God Damn 
Anik.

3528
02:36:40,431 --> 02:36:42,530
And they climbed down while you're.
While you're sleeping.

3529
02:36:42,540 --> 02:36:44,940
They make themselves some food and they 
climb right back up there.

3530
02:36:44,941 --> 02:36:46,290
That's like a little human rat.

3531
02:36:47,420 --> 02:36:48,330
Here's where she was staying.

3532
02:36:49,550 --> 02:36:52,850
What's your name and how long does it 
say?

3533
02:36:52,851 --> 02:36:55,100
How long she was up there for?
Do they know?

3534
02:36:55,101 --> 02:36:56,390
Did she admit it?
She in jail.

3535
02:36:56,570 --> 02:36:58,610
She insists.
It's actually her house.

3536
02:37:00,060 --> 02:37:04,290
He knocked and found a dark haired woman
who said that Jimmy was letting him live

3537
02:37:04,291 --> 02:37:06,450
there.
He called the police,

3538
02:37:06,451 --> 02:37:08,160
but the woman who fled before they 
arrived.

3539
02:37:11,590 --> 02:37:16,590
Wait.
It's not unusual to what and it's a go 

3540
02:37:16,590 --> 02:37:16,590
back up a little bit.
It's not unusual.

3541
02:37:16,590 --> 02:37:17,570
Oh,
was it say,

3542
02:37:17,630 --> 02:37:21,530
but one man was shocked to find a woman.
I wonder how often that happens.

3543
02:37:21,620 --> 02:37:25,760
It's not unusual to find unwelcome bats,
squirrels or termites in the attic,

3544
02:37:26,570 --> 02:37:28,100
but one man found a woman.
Ooh,

3545
02:37:28,130 --> 02:37:29,570
Jesus Christ.
What does that

3546
02:37:29,890 --> 02:37:32,880
some other video started playing.
Here's where she was.

3547
02:37:34,600 --> 02:37:36,490
Wow.
Apartment there,

3548
02:37:36,970 --> 02:37:39,940
so she had like a little spot up there.
If you look this up too,

3549
02:37:39,941 --> 02:37:41,440
it's.
This isn't an uncommon story.

3550
02:37:41,441 --> 02:37:43,870
This happened a few times to other 
people.

3551
02:37:43,960 --> 02:37:48,960
Oh Shit.
They're just living in their fucking 

3552
02:37:48,960 --> 02:37:48,960
house.

3553
02:37:48,960 --> 02:37:52,310
Well,
there's a lot of homeless people that 

3554
02:37:52,310 --> 02:37:54,021
eventually become squatters.
That's a big problem with people to 

3555
02:37:54,021 --> 02:37:57,200
someone just set up shop and your house 
and start living there and cooking and 

3556
02:37:57,200 --> 02:37:58,350
bringing food home and they changed the 
locks and then they say,

3557
02:37:58,351 --> 02:38:00,510
this is my house,
and then you have to.

3558
02:38:00,600 --> 02:38:03,480
You have to actually figure out some way
to prove that it's your house.

3559
02:38:03,481 --> 02:38:05,070
Then you didn't send it,
you know,

3560
02:38:05,130 --> 02:38:08,460
rent it to them or that you have to 
figure out a way to kick them out,

3561
02:38:08,760 --> 02:38:13,760
kick their ass.
When you thought about fucking what do 

3562
02:38:13,760 --> 02:38:17,661
you see someone living in your house,
you're going to fucking try to go to 

3563
02:38:17,661 --> 02:38:17,661
court.
If you look,

3564
02:38:17,661 --> 02:38:21,150
let's say this side kick and randomly 
the not maybe me,

3565
02:38:21,151 --> 02:38:21,960
but what if,
what if?

3566
02:38:21,990 --> 02:38:24,540
What if you're a guy that has a house in
big bear.

3567
02:38:25,260 --> 02:38:26,160
Okay,
okay.

3568
02:38:26,250 --> 02:38:28,540
And you're,
you're not there very often and then you

3569
02:38:28,541 --> 02:38:31,860
go up to big bear one day and the locks 
changed and some guys looking at through

3570
02:38:31,861 --> 02:38:32,850
the window,
can I help you?

3571
02:38:33,480 --> 02:38:35,220
And you're like,
this is my house.

3572
02:38:35,221 --> 02:38:36,810
The fuck it is is my house.
And you're like,

3573
02:38:36,811 --> 02:38:41,811
what are you talking about?
Why you in my house would you do to buy 

3574
02:38:41,811 --> 02:38:41,811
locks?
Like the guys just squatter duty.

3575
02:38:41,811 --> 02:38:42,960
Come back with some friends and you just
fucked.

3576
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:44,970
Fuck this dude out.
He's got a gun.

3577
02:38:46,720 --> 02:38:48,340
You come and go.
He calls the police,

3578
02:38:48,370 --> 02:38:53,370
the police show up.
And the police like you breaking and 

3579
02:38:53,370 --> 02:38:53,370
entering like,
no,

3580
02:38:53,370 --> 02:38:53,370
this is my house.
I know he lives here.

3581
02:38:53,370 --> 02:38:56,020
Possession is nine tenths of the law.
This gentleman's inside the building.

3582
02:38:56,590 --> 02:38:59,530
I always heard that from kids.
Possession is nine tenths of the law.

3583
02:38:59,990 --> 02:39:03,070
What is there a fucking percentage of 
the law is the law.

3584
02:39:03,071 --> 02:39:05,300
The law possession is nine tenths of the
law.

3585
02:39:05,301 --> 02:39:05,830
Is that real?

3586
02:39:07,900 --> 02:39:10,090
What?
That's how it's hard to say what I would

3587
02:39:10,091 --> 02:39:11,780
do.
I saw something about it.

3588
02:39:12,070 --> 02:39:14,920
Let them have the house.
Some woman bought a house and right when

3589
02:39:14,921 --> 02:39:18,640
she was about to move in some woman who 
had just moved in and she had been there

3590
02:39:18,641 --> 02:39:21,370
for like two weeks and she changed the 
locks and she was like,

3591
02:39:21,371 --> 02:39:26,371
someone leased it to me online.
Like she said that someone online like 

3592
02:39:26,371 --> 02:39:29,100
was leasing this lady's house.
Is it a scam or is it real?

3593
02:39:29,101 --> 02:39:34,101
It could be a scam on both sides.
Could be she's lying or it could be 

3594
02:39:34,101 --> 02:39:37,771
someone ran a scam on her and got her to
pay rent for a house and she really 

3595
02:39:37,771 --> 02:39:39,250
thought it was hers could be.
Right.

3596
02:39:40,760 --> 02:39:41,800
That's true.
Totally.

3597
02:39:42,310 --> 02:39:47,310
Was I think I was fooled what's up?
Eddie called this video out properly 

3598
02:39:47,310 --> 02:39:48,400
being fake,
I think.

3599
02:39:48,700 --> 02:39:50,980
Which video?
That video of the lady in the apartment.

3600
02:39:51,100 --> 02:39:52,210
Oh yeah.
Fake.

3601
02:39:52,270 --> 02:39:57,270
I found a story.
Apparently people are adding this video 

3602
02:39:57,270 --> 02:39:57,270
to that story.
So yeah,

3603
02:39:57,270 --> 02:40:01,651
this have another side.
I just said that it was a marketing 

3604
02:40:01,651 --> 02:40:01,651
campaign for a rental website.

3605
02:40:01,651 --> 02:40:03,540
The Daily Mail UK put out a marketing 
campaign.

3606
02:40:03,600 --> 02:40:05,060
I mean,
I'll show you a series of thing.

3607
02:40:05,070 --> 02:40:07,350
How would they use that to get business?
I said,

3608
02:40:07,351 --> 02:40:09,270
this video is fake.
It's a marketing campaign.

3609
02:40:10,010 --> 02:40:12,560
Oh,
interesting campaign for what?

3610
02:40:13,260 --> 02:40:15,810
We're making an apartment style.
Damn fake news,

3611
02:40:15,811 --> 02:40:18,300
man.
Real fake news.com.

3612
02:40:18,360 --> 02:40:21,900
Go Watch that shit.
That's just like Blair witch.

3613
02:40:22,320 --> 02:40:24,930
So much shit.
I believe Blair witch.

3614
02:40:24,931 --> 02:40:26,910
The first time I saw it,
I thought it was really hard.

3615
02:40:29,040 --> 02:40:33,150
Did you ever see the Bobcat Goldthwait 
Blair witch style movie?

3616
02:40:33,660 --> 02:40:36,570
He made a boot and move about bigfoot 
willow creek.

3617
02:40:36,970 --> 02:40:40,140
It's a Blair witch style bigfoot movie.
It's pretty fucking good.

3618
02:40:40,760 --> 02:40:44,190
If you want to get scared at the idea is
that all those people that go missing in

3619
02:40:44,191 --> 02:40:49,191
the forest,
that's one thing where people go 

3620
02:40:49,191 --> 02:40:49,191
missing.
That's legit.

3621
02:40:49,191 --> 02:40:49,710
Like a ton of people go missing every 
year in the national parks,

3622
02:40:50,190 --> 02:40:51,970
national parks and forests,
they just easy,

3623
02:40:52,260 --> 02:40:56,430
easy to pick them off their road,
get Jack if there's a market for it,

3624
02:40:56,431 --> 02:40:58,140
you don't think there's guys out there 
trying to make money.

3625
02:40:58,470 --> 02:40:59,790
I think they're getting eaten by 
animals.

3626
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:05,000
People are there in deep woods and 
they're falling down and breaking their 

3627
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:06,450
leg and getting eaten by bears and shit.
For sure.

3628
02:41:06,451 --> 02:41:07,980
There's a lot of that.
There's a lot of that.

3629
02:41:08,060 --> 02:41:10,140
When you have someone that like if 
you're in the business,

3630
02:41:10,141 --> 02:41:12,870
that's a good spot.
Get people camping so I'll never see it.

3631
02:41:13,230 --> 02:41:15,570
They're never going to investigate.
They're going to say a bear took them.

3632
02:41:15,630 --> 02:41:17,250
Yeah.
Your Business.

3633
02:41:17,251 --> 02:41:18,630
That would be.
If that was your business,

3634
02:41:18,780 --> 02:41:20,440
go and what's the easiest way?
Right,

3635
02:41:20,520 --> 02:41:23,280
but bears can't get people.
I know.

3636
02:41:23,281 --> 02:41:25,080
It's a poor guy that got perfect.
Good.

3637
02:41:25,081 --> 02:41:28,180
Just got jack the other day,
woke up and his tent to the sound of his

3638
02:41:28,181 --> 02:41:31,410
skull cracking because a bear with 
biting down on a skull.

3639
02:41:31,590 --> 02:41:34,470
Oh,
the kid that got killed.

3640
02:41:34,590 --> 02:41:37,410
How often do every year kill people?
Every year.

3641
02:41:37,500 --> 02:41:39,000
Every year.
Every United States.

3642
02:41:39,360 --> 02:41:40,520
Every year someone's getting killed.

3643
02:41:40,540 --> 02:41:42,690
Many five.
Couple for a couple.

3644
02:41:42,691 --> 02:41:43,260
Two,
three.

3645
02:41:43,470 --> 02:41:44,910
Not that many.
You know?

3646
02:41:44,911 --> 02:41:47,430
A kid got killed at rutgers and then the
most recent one,

3647
02:41:47,640 --> 02:41:50,880
a kid got killed.
He was in a road race in Alaska.

3648
02:41:51,360 --> 02:41:56,360
It was racing like some track event and 
he was lagging behind and he saw a bear 

3649
02:41:57,210 --> 02:41:58,920
and the bear was going after him and 
he's like,

3650
02:41:58,980 --> 02:42:03,360
he called his mom and said mom was bare 
following me and the bear jacked him,

3651
02:42:03,570 --> 02:42:05,910
dragged him into the woods.
They had to kill the bear.

3652
02:42:05,970 --> 02:42:06,760
The bear was like,
oh,

3653
02:42:06,790 --> 02:42:09,240
hoarding.
Like covering the body,

3654
02:42:09,241 --> 02:42:10,430
like protecting it.
Oh,

3655
02:42:10,440 --> 02:42:13,260
they found the bear at.
Because the mom sent someone out.

3656
02:42:13,261 --> 02:42:14,400
Yeah,
they found the fair.

3657
02:42:14,450 --> 02:42:18,030
The found the bear guarding the body.
Think it was his and he was going to eat

3658
02:42:18,031 --> 02:42:23,031
it.
How much they eat at that point for 

3659
02:42:24,650 --> 02:42:27,090
whatever he could get tore him apart 
though.

3660
02:42:28,170 --> 02:42:30,420
It's not a good way to go.
No.

3661
02:42:30,570 --> 02:42:35,570
How about that documentary with that 
crazy dude who timothy treadwell was one

3662
02:42:36,451 --> 02:42:38,880
of the best documentaries ever.
Grizzly man.

3663
02:42:38,910 --> 02:42:42,120
The way it was setup to cause the first 
half of the documentary who really liked

3664
02:42:42,121 --> 02:42:47,121
that guy like this guy really cares 
about these bears and all the sound 

3665
02:42:47,121 --> 02:42:50,060
bites that we're using from the multiple
interviews that they took were all stuff

3666
02:42:50,061 --> 02:42:51,960
that we're saying good things about them
and you're like,

3667
02:42:51,990 --> 02:42:54,180
oh,
and then the slow it gets dark.

3668
02:42:54,181 --> 02:42:58,680
It was just this crazy dude out there 
who's crazier and crazier and crazier as

3669
02:42:58,681 --> 02:43:00,720
time goes on.
When I love.

3670
02:43:00,721 --> 02:43:03,660
When the pilot was it a pilot sheriff,
grizzly man Grizzly,

3671
02:43:03,661 --> 02:43:08,661
because it a pirate of the sheriff goes.
I thought he was retarded setting lap 

3672
02:43:10,080 --> 02:43:11,710
though.
It's funny

3673
02:43:12,930 --> 02:43:14,400
with bears,
you can't be hanging out.

3674
02:43:14,410 --> 02:43:19,410
He wasn't just hanging out with bears.
He was hanging out with them deep into 

3675
02:43:19,410 --> 02:43:22,231
the late season were the only ones that 
were alive that weren't in hibernation 

3676
02:43:22,231 --> 02:43:23,530
where the starving ones,
like he was in a danger zone.

3677
02:43:24,130 --> 02:43:29,130
Like most of the time those bears,
like if you're around bears that are 

3678
02:43:29,130 --> 02:43:29,130
eating salmon,
you're not even in danger.

3679
02:43:29,130 --> 02:43:31,690
They're just eating so much salmon.
They don't want to try to chase you.

3680
02:43:31,870 --> 02:43:34,380
Didn't even think of you as real.
Yeah.

3681
02:43:34,450 --> 02:43:35,720
There's an area that we,
uh,

3682
02:43:35,770 --> 02:43:40,770
was it the Kenai peninsula,
that video that we showed where that 

3683
02:43:40,770 --> 02:43:41,700
huge bear wanders up to that dude.
It's not even trying to kill him.

3684
02:43:41,770 --> 02:43:46,770
It doesn't even care because there's 
like 30 bears on the stream and they're 

3685
02:43:46,770 --> 02:43:48,730
all just jack and salmon.
They're eating so much salmon,

3686
02:43:48,880 --> 02:43:52,540
but this bear lumbers up and it's like 
the size of a vw bus.

3687
02:43:52,900 --> 02:43:57,900
It's so fucking big and this to just sit
in there and this bears is just walks 

3688
02:43:58,331 --> 02:44:02,560
over with these dead button eyes.
They have those black dead eyes.

3689
02:44:02,920 --> 02:44:04,120
Oh,
they're so creepy.

3690
02:44:04,540 --> 02:44:06,250
I mean,
they're beautiful in a lot of ways,

3691
02:44:06,251 --> 02:44:11,251
but look at this thing.
Look at this thing right up next to his 

3692
02:44:11,251 --> 02:44:11,251
lawn chair.
Look at these things.

3693
02:44:11,251 --> 02:44:11,650
Eyes.

3694
02:44:15,440 --> 02:44:17,990
This is an eating machine.
That's what that is.

3695
02:44:18,180 --> 02:44:21,800
That's like a pit bull times a thousand 
to thousand pounds eating machine

3696
02:44:22,970 --> 02:44:24,950
and they look so lovable.
Yeah,

3697
02:44:25,070 --> 02:44:30,070
of course.
They look like your friends in the 

3698
02:44:30,070 --> 02:44:30,070
movies that talk.
Well,

3699
02:44:30,070 --> 02:44:30,830
what are you guys want to do to teddy 
bears?

3700
02:44:30,920 --> 02:44:35,920
Should we go fusion?
A lot of fishing going on here and so 

3701
02:44:35,920 --> 02:44:36,440
this guy's hanging out and it just 
starts walking towards him.

3702
02:44:36,620 --> 02:44:40,490
I mean this thing is 10 feet from him 
and we're eating the bear.

3703
02:44:40,630 --> 02:44:42,860
Yeah,
eat bear black bear.

3704
02:44:43,640 --> 02:44:46,340
What does it taste like?
Like fuck the cow.

3705
02:44:46,970 --> 02:44:50,540
Nice at this.
This thing is just to get his nails.

3706
02:44:51,020 --> 02:44:53,870
Look at those fucking clause.
Holy Shit.

3707
02:44:55,190 --> 02:44:58,790
The head on that thing.
That is an enormous bet on this guy.

3708
02:44:58,791 --> 02:45:00,440
This guy just freezing.
Yeah,

3709
02:45:00,470 --> 02:45:05,470
I mean he was taking pictures.
He's a photographer and it shows it 

3710
02:45:05,470 --> 02:45:08,391
towards the end of the video and this 
guy was taking pictures of that river 

3711
02:45:08,391 --> 02:45:10,310
which is filled with bears filled with 
bears,

3712
02:45:10,311 --> 02:45:12,560
eat and salmon,
and this is just a full bear.

3713
02:45:12,561 --> 02:45:17,561
He's full.
So he says to the bear,

3714
02:45:17,641 --> 02:45:18,520
hey,
hey,

3715
02:45:18,730 --> 02:45:22,540
look at the code.
Just noise,

3716
02:45:22,541 --> 02:45:23,710
just noise.
Now look at that,

3717
02:45:23,920 --> 02:45:24,420
look at it.
We'll

3718
02:45:24,450 --> 02:45:29,450
get all the bears back up real quick.
I'd want to see them look at this to do 

3719
02:45:29,450 --> 02:45:29,450
this.
Look at this.

3720
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,420
Look when he turns,
look at all these fucking bear.

3721
02:45:32,490 --> 02:45:34,770
Holy Shit.
There's so many bears.

3722
02:45:35,550 --> 02:45:39,900
So this area,
which is overwhelmed by bears,

3723
02:45:39,901 --> 02:45:41,490
there's never been a death report it 
there.

3724
02:45:41,960 --> 02:45:45,630
They don't kill people there because 
there's so many fucking salmon that they

3725
02:45:45,631 --> 02:45:48,150
just gorge themselves on salmon and just
chill out.

3726
02:45:48,151 --> 02:45:50,910
But if they're hungry they'll fuck you 
up.

3727
02:45:51,240 --> 02:45:54,060
I just figure you out.
Like I could eat this dude.

3728
02:45:54,570 --> 02:45:59,570
And then once they eat you that,
well I can't believe I didn't need him 

3729
02:45:59,570 --> 02:45:59,570
before.
That was easy.

3730
02:45:59,570 --> 02:46:02,240
Like it's like we have this stupid idea 
that there's a contract.

3731
02:46:05,550 --> 02:46:10,550
We have a stupid idea.
Like there's some contract between us 

3732
02:46:10,550 --> 02:46:10,550
and bears know they're not going to fuck

3733
02:46:10,550 --> 02:46:10,550
us up.
Well,

3734
02:46:10,550 --> 02:46:11,930
they like us.
We're cool.

3735
02:46:12,110 --> 02:46:17,110
Most Times bears are scared of people.
Is there a video of a bear and a lion 

3736
02:46:17,110 --> 02:46:18,050
fighting onshore?
Right?

3737
02:46:18,230 --> 02:46:23,230
Probably like China or something.
If you had to put money on a full grown 

3738
02:46:23,230 --> 02:46:23,960
bear,
grizzly bear or a lion,

3739
02:46:24,950 --> 02:46:26,840
what do you think?
I'm going with the lion all day.

3740
02:46:28,280 --> 02:46:29,450
Yeah.
I'm going to cat.

3741
02:46:29,900 --> 02:46:32,420
They both have tremendous clause.
Yeah.

3742
02:46:32,450 --> 02:46:34,160
I'm going with the cat.
He's more athletic.

3743
02:46:34,730 --> 02:46:36,980
He moves better cats.
Just fuck everything up.

3744
02:46:37,550 --> 02:46:38,840
They fuck everything up.
They fuck up.

3745
02:46:38,841 --> 02:46:40,550
Crocodiles.
You seen leopards?

3746
02:46:40,551 --> 02:46:42,820
Jack Crocodiles,
Jaguars,

3747
02:46:42,830 --> 02:46:43,610
Jaguars.
Greg,

3748
02:46:43,650 --> 02:46:44,180
Greg,
Jack,

3749
02:46:44,181 --> 02:46:45,980
crocodiles.
I bit leopards do too.

3750
02:46:46,280 --> 02:46:48,560
Yeah.
They just cancerous too fast.

3751
02:46:48,800 --> 02:46:53,800
The two mean did the meanest of all the 
animals and they're one of the rare 

3752
02:46:53,800 --> 02:46:56,180
animals that only eats meat,
like they only killed things.

3753
02:46:56,450 --> 02:47:01,450
Like what do bears eat?
Berries and she got a polar bear versus 

3754
02:47:01,450 --> 02:47:01,450
a great white shark.

3755
02:47:01,710 --> 02:47:04,130
I got to go with the shark.
I think the barrel fuck up.

3756
02:47:04,131 --> 02:47:09,131
The great white.
I don't think he's going to be able to 

3757
02:47:09,131 --> 02:47:09,131
fuck them up in the water.
They swim and swim that good.

3758
02:47:09,131 --> 02:47:10,760
All right.
Not that good.

3759
02:47:10,910 --> 02:47:12,680
Oh,
this is a mountain lion.

3760
02:47:13,700 --> 02:47:15,410
A mountain lion bear.
Yeah.

3761
02:47:15,530 --> 02:47:16,960
Holy Shit.
Them outlines,

3762
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:18,710
bite in the bear in the head and the 
bears like whatever.

3763
02:47:18,711 --> 02:47:20,150
Bitch.
Barely.

3764
02:47:20,860 --> 02:47:22,480
This is amazing.
I barely.

3765
02:47:23,410 --> 02:47:25,010
Oh,
so it's a female.

3766
02:47:25,310 --> 02:47:30,310
It's a male bear and a female mountain 
lion that's guarding or cubs pair in the

3767
02:47:30,440 --> 02:47:31,210
face.
It's like,

3768
02:47:31,211 --> 02:47:32,450
well,
let's make a killer video.

3769
02:47:32,451 --> 02:47:35,870
They just take this captured mountain 
lion and bear and they just,

3770
02:47:35,960 --> 02:47:37,010
oh,
that's ready to go at it.

3771
02:47:37,070 --> 02:47:42,070
I think that's real.
She's just trying to keep that therapy 

3772
02:47:42,070 --> 02:47:45,410
for the kids because if you just have 
cameras set up where a mountain lion 

3773
02:47:45,410 --> 02:47:47,270
activity is de,
stay away,

3774
02:47:47,271 --> 02:47:48,500
use a zoom lens.

3775
02:47:48,500 --> 02:47:49,730
There's a bunch of different ways.
I mean,

3776
02:47:49,731 --> 02:47:54,731
they've gotten a bunch of different 
really incredible encounters between 

3777
02:47:54,731 --> 02:47:57,890
animals just by filming hundreds and 
hundreds and hundreds of hours.

3778
02:47:58,220 --> 02:47:59,900
You stay in the field for months at a 
time.

3779
02:47:59,901 --> 02:48:03,200
You see things like,
look at this lion and the bear.

3780
02:48:03,500 --> 02:48:05,420
Those are some good camera angles,
so get this,

3781
02:48:05,421 --> 02:48:07,970
but that's a black bear.
See someone set this up.

3782
02:48:07,971 --> 02:48:10,310
That's a black bear and a lion.
That's crazy.

3783
02:48:10,490 --> 02:48:15,490
That's not a big bear.
That's a small bear and a big line 

3784
02:48:15,490 --> 02:48:15,940
blind.
Never lived together.

3785
02:48:16,060 --> 02:48:16,580
Yeah.
How would.

3786
02:48:16,640 --> 02:48:18,950
How would they be in the same spot?
Somebody put them together.

3787
02:48:19,010 --> 02:48:20,570
No,
no other way.

3788
02:48:21,450 --> 02:48:25,500
Black lines are only in Africa.
The pairs are only in North America.

3789
02:48:25,501 --> 02:48:26,760
This one at least.
Actually.

3790
02:48:26,761 --> 02:48:31,761
Probably.
They probably got some of those in Asia 

3791
02:48:31,761 --> 02:48:32,200
that looks similar.
That looks like a zoo right?

3792
02:48:32,201 --> 02:48:32,980
There.
It is.

3793
02:48:32,981 --> 02:48:34,540
As a.
What the fuck is that animal?

3794
02:48:37,730 --> 02:48:39,950
That's another one.
Those two lines.

3795
02:48:40,010 --> 02:48:41,190
Oh,
he's about to get some.

3796
02:48:41,930 --> 02:48:42,680
Oh,
he's taking a shit.

3797
02:48:42,860 --> 02:48:44,860
There's a bear in there too.
Oh,

3798
02:48:44,870 --> 02:48:48,410
the bear gets lead in later.
Oh Shit.

3799
02:48:48,411 --> 02:48:50,420
There's a bear right there.
Oh fuck.

3800
02:48:50,960 --> 02:48:52,100
Yeah.
What's going on here?

3801
02:48:52,160 --> 02:48:57,160
This is like some like a snuff film.
Well they do shit like that in like 

3802
02:48:57,720 --> 02:48:59,280
other countries.
Yeah.

3803
02:48:59,360 --> 02:49:02,120
I've seen videos where they have betting
matches.

3804
02:49:02,360 --> 02:49:05,890
Look at this as barren.
This line is like my food.

3805
02:49:06,470 --> 02:49:07,980
That's a big ass black bear.

3806
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:09,240
Take them,
fight over the food.

3807
02:49:09,330 --> 02:49:10,920
That's a thing.
And doing over there.

3808
02:49:10,921 --> 02:49:15,720
Just facing the eating something or 
eating something.

3809
02:49:16,210 --> 02:49:16,580
Okay.

3810
02:49:17,270 --> 02:49:19,850
This is weird.
I don't understand.

3811
02:49:21,490 --> 02:49:24,530
It's um,
I think they're just go to back.

3812
02:49:24,850 --> 02:49:29,850
What about a full grown chimp versus a 
tiger tiger all day.

3813
02:49:31,060 --> 02:49:31,780
Really?
Yeah.

3814
02:49:31,781 --> 02:49:33,250
I got with the cat.
You always go.

3815
02:49:33,260 --> 02:49:35,650
I always go with a cat.
Especially the cats.

3816
02:49:35,651 --> 02:49:38,920
Bigger like a full grown cat can be like
900 pounds.

3817
02:49:38,921 --> 02:49:40,480
Plus Hydros can swim,
right?

3818
02:49:40,560 --> 02:49:41,680
Yeah.
Do they go into water?

3819
02:49:42,010 --> 02:49:43,270
They could swim underwater.
Yeah.

3820
02:49:43,400 --> 02:49:46,800
Tiger versus great white.
Great Light.

3821
02:49:46,910 --> 02:49:51,910
You think so water.
You don't always go for cats that I 

3822
02:49:51,910 --> 02:49:51,910
always go for cat,
but the great white,

3823
02:49:51,910 --> 02:49:52,490
so much bigger.
Still a cat.

3824
02:49:55,930 --> 02:50:00,700
There's a picture of a surprise.
I think a tiger would take a fucking.

3825
02:50:00,790 --> 02:50:02,380
They're taken out.
Crocodiles,

3826
02:50:03,340 --> 02:50:03,910
great.
White.

3827
02:50:03,911 --> 02:50:05,650
They're not smart.
That's true.

3828
02:50:05,740 --> 02:50:10,740
They try to eat cages and shit.
I don't think they'd be able to do 

3829
02:50:10,740 --> 02:50:11,440
anything with it though.
I don't think it's too much.

3830
02:50:11,710 --> 02:50:12,370
It's like,
you know,

3831
02:50:12,430 --> 02:50:14,410
a real great whites,
like a thousand pounds.

3832
02:50:14,700 --> 02:50:16,150
I went to Fox.
That tiger going to do.

3833
02:50:16,290 --> 02:50:21,290
Then it's swim with it and its mouth.
They figured out that you could swim 

3834
02:50:21,290 --> 02:50:24,361
with all sharks.
Now the sharks are like if it hit them 

3835
02:50:24,361 --> 02:50:28,531
at the right time or whatever,
you could swim with sharks except for 

3836
02:50:28,531 --> 02:50:29,500
great whites,
but there is one lady who swims of great

3837
02:50:29,501 --> 02:50:30,950
white sharks.
What is this?

3838
02:50:32,620 --> 02:50:33,940
15 foot,
what is it?

3839
02:50:34,060 --> 02:50:39,060
14 or 15 foot.
Great white like in three foot of water 

3840
02:50:39,060 --> 02:50:39,060
off the coast of Mexico.
In this bay.

3841
02:50:39,060 --> 02:50:39,910
It got.
It got hit right here,

3842
02:50:39,911 --> 02:50:44,911
but the propeller,
but they found out it was feeding off 

3843
02:50:44,911 --> 02:50:44,911
Stinger race.
It wasn't like beach journey thing.

3844
02:50:44,911 --> 02:50:47,010
Oh really?
Close to a dude.

3845
02:50:47,020 --> 02:50:48,790
It's fuck.
Where's this?

3846
02:50:49,500 --> 02:50:54,500
That's why I was there.
It wasn't there because it was stuck in 

3847
02:50:54,500 --> 02:50:54,500
there because it was feeding off sting 
range.

3848
02:50:54,500 --> 02:50:58,950
If you watched the whole video,
the guy that they're wondering if it's 

3849
02:50:58,950 --> 02:50:58,950
like caught in a net or what's going on 
with that.

3850
02:50:58,950 --> 02:50:59,650
He gets real close here.
You can see this.

3851
02:50:59,860 --> 02:51:02,360
This injury on its back.
It got hit by propeller.

3852
02:51:02,880 --> 02:51:05,620
I'm not going to show this online.
If you want to look it up on Youtube.

3853
02:51:05,621 --> 02:51:10,621
It's Pearson brothers winery films.
Fifty yanked my views on it right now.

3854
02:51:11,201 --> 02:51:12,170
It's A.
Yeah.

3855
02:51:12,220 --> 02:51:15,700
Whenever you try to put someone else's 
youtube video on your youtube video,

3856
02:51:15,701 --> 02:51:19,000
you get yanked.
Look at the scars on his back,

3857
02:51:19,030 --> 02:51:21,070
so he all got.
He got fucked up by a propeller.

3858
02:51:21,071 --> 02:51:24,300
That's what happened.
Now it also starts moving around too.

3859
02:51:24,600 --> 02:51:27,850
I think I got a little fucking Harry.
Wow.

3860
02:51:30,790 --> 02:51:33,990
It's pretty dark.
Wow.

3861
02:51:33,991 --> 02:51:36,720
I guess size of that thing.
I didn't know there were so dark.

3862
02:51:37,590 --> 02:51:39,150
Well,
it's probably just shitty lighting

3863
02:51:40,500 --> 02:51:41,710
or shitty.
Scary.

3864
02:51:41,730 --> 02:51:42,450
Scariest.
Fuck.

3865
02:51:42,451 --> 02:51:45,840
That looks like a great thing.
Just an eating machine.

3866
02:51:46,020 --> 02:51:48,810
There's been a bunch of videos that are 
really crazy to watch.

3867
02:51:48,811 --> 02:51:51,900
Where they take a drone.
They flied over Malibu and you see these

3868
02:51:51,901 --> 02:51:54,710
people surfing and just a few hundred 
yards outside.

3869
02:51:54,820 --> 02:51:57,520
People surf.
When you see a great white water.

3870
02:51:57,630 --> 02:51:59,070
No,
we're in Malibu.

3871
02:51:59,130 --> 02:52:00,950
Oh Shit.
Ooh.

3872
02:52:00,960 --> 02:52:05,960
Yeah.
That guy's in the water right next to 

3873
02:52:05,960 --> 02:52:06,070
that thing.
Got Woken at it.

3874
02:52:06,071 --> 02:52:08,170
He got hit by a sting right twice in his
foot.

3875
02:52:08,171 --> 02:52:09,910
One was like a six inch gas.
He said,

3876
02:52:10,030 --> 02:52:11,890
oh Jesus.
So there must be like a school,

3877
02:52:11,891 --> 02:52:15,760
a stingray singly jacked his foot.
Oh fuck man.

3878
02:52:15,820 --> 02:52:17,860
What are you doing?
We retarded.

3879
02:52:18,430 --> 02:52:19,570
Get out of their kid.
Fucked up.

3880
02:52:19,650 --> 02:52:24,650
Step it on sting rays.
You fuck like you accidentally step on 

3881
02:52:24,650 --> 02:52:24,650
them,
right?

3882
02:52:24,650 --> 02:52:24,910
Don't they like bury themselves in the 
sand?

3883
02:52:25,030 --> 02:52:29,260
Is there video of that?
Drove Filming Malibu?

3884
02:52:29,320 --> 02:52:30,010
Yeah.
Pull.

3885
02:52:30,011 --> 02:52:35,011
Uh,
pull up a great white spotted off of 

3886
02:52:35,011 --> 02:52:35,050
southern California coast.

3887
02:52:36,870 --> 02:52:40,500
Look at that now.
This is Malibu?

3888
02:52:40,501 --> 02:52:41,790
Yes.
Pismo beach.

3889
02:52:41,791 --> 02:52:42,780
It says.
Okay.

3890
02:52:43,290 --> 02:52:45,690
That's pretty close.
That's a couple hours up the coast.

3891
02:52:46,710 --> 02:52:50,940
There's a gang of them.
And are they great white sharks there?

3892
02:52:50,970 --> 02:52:55,970
Yeah,
they think it's a great white when they 

3893
02:52:55,970 --> 02:52:55,970
get real big,

3894
02:52:55,970 --> 02:53:00,910
there's a,
there's a quite a few videos that 

3895
02:53:00,910 --> 02:53:00,910
they're catching drones.
One of them,

3896
02:53:00,910 --> 02:53:04,991
they had people real recently.
They evacuated the beach.

3897
02:53:06,270 --> 02:53:09,660
Sad.
Oh Shit.

3898
02:53:10,710 --> 02:53:14,730
Oh fuck the wave.
It's right there.

3899
02:53:14,970 --> 02:53:16,560
It's right there with everybody.
You know what?

3900
02:53:16,561 --> 02:53:18,180
They should have those patrolling the 
beach.

3901
02:53:18,350 --> 02:53:21,540
The other one right now.
He has no idea.

3902
02:53:21,990 --> 02:53:23,700
Isn't that crazy?
It's right there.

3903
02:53:23,820 --> 02:53:27,090
Oh fuck.
He's just waiting.

3904
02:53:27,720 --> 02:53:30,300
Wave.
And that is right underneath them.

3905
02:53:31,080 --> 02:53:33,600
Are you kidding me?
Fuck all that.

3906
02:53:34,380 --> 02:53:36,240
He has no idea.
He has no idea.

3907
02:53:36,241 --> 02:53:39,810
And what does that thing?
And then he's gone.

3908
02:53:40,110 --> 02:53:42,390
He's gone a bit of a bitch.
You sharks all the time.

3909
02:53:42,391 --> 02:53:47,391
They were about to go on some surfer and
then they take a fucking wave and he 

3910
02:53:47,391 --> 02:53:51,301
saved his ass.
Do they probably are near death often.

3911
02:53:54,120 --> 02:53:57,690
Those guys are so gangster guys like 
Kelly slater and.

3912
02:53:58,410 --> 02:53:59,470
Yeah,
fuck that.

3913
02:53:59,740 --> 02:54:01,950
Dorian job's fucked it up for me,
man.

3914
02:54:02,020 --> 02:54:04,080
Joe.
I know that's brainwashed.

3915
02:54:04,081 --> 02:54:05,100
All that.
But it worked.

3916
02:54:05,240 --> 02:54:08,090
I was brainwashed as a movie.
This

3917
02:54:08,100 --> 02:54:08,890
was about,
you know,

3918
02:54:08,891 --> 02:54:13,891
when it was a,
what the inspiration was some real 

3919
02:54:13,891 --> 02:54:16,951
shark.
That was real shark attack in 

3920
02:54:16,951 --> 02:54:16,951
freshwater.
It's real crazy.

3921
02:54:16,951 --> 02:54:17,220
There's a,
there's a shark,

3922
02:54:17,300 --> 02:54:22,300
a bull shark that swims from the ocean 
up rivers into fresh water and can get 

3923
02:54:22,300 --> 02:54:26,761
as far north as Illinois and then the 
most aggressive sharks day and they 

3924
02:54:26,761 --> 02:54:28,750
killed a bunch of people in a river in 
New Jersey.

3925
02:54:29,890 --> 02:54:34,890
Yeah,
I think it was like the early 19 

3926
02:54:34,890 --> 02:54:36,961
hundreds,
I want to say like the 19 thirties or 

3927
02:54:36,961 --> 02:54:38,971
some shit.
They killed a bunch of people in our 

3928
02:54:38,971 --> 02:54:39,660
fresh water river in New Jersey,
so these people would be swimming.

3929
02:54:39,670 --> 02:54:40,670
Hey,
let's go swimming.

3930
02:54:40,700 --> 02:54:41,530
All right.
Everybody,

3931
02:54:41,531 --> 02:54:43,600
and they didn't know shit back then and 
then just see.

3932
02:54:43,610 --> 02:54:48,250
Just just get torn apart by sharks.
I think it had happened.

3933
02:54:48,251 --> 02:54:49,480
Uh,
where's that one?

3934
02:54:50,320 --> 02:54:54,970
Indiana side of the Ohio River,
the Indiana side of the Ohio River.

3935
02:54:55,030 --> 02:54:57,520
And they catch a fucking bull shark.
Do you?

3936
02:54:57,530 --> 02:54:59,530
Not Crazy.
That is that thing.

3937
02:54:59,531 --> 02:55:03,530
Got All the way up the river in fresh 
water.

3938
02:55:03,760 --> 02:55:05,810
They're the only shark that we know that
can do that.

3939
02:55:05,811 --> 02:55:07,670
And Weird.
Weirdly,

3940
02:55:07,671 --> 02:55:12,671
it's one of the most aggressive sharks.
I don't think we know of any other 

3941
02:55:12,671 --> 02:55:12,830
sharks that go up.
Fresh water like that.

3942
02:55:12,831 --> 02:55:14,180
Right?
It's not the only one.

3943
02:55:15,950 --> 02:55:18,560
I think that's the only one to travel up
rivers.

3944
02:55:18,561 --> 02:55:21,890
They have been known to travel as far up
as Indiana in the Ohio River.

3945
02:55:21,891 --> 02:55:26,891
Although I've been recorded attacks,
they're probably responsible for the 

3946
02:55:26,891 --> 02:55:30,641
majority of nearshore shark attacks,
including many attacks attributed to 

3947
02:55:30,641 --> 02:55:34,370
other sharks and see if he could find 
the inspiration for the movie jaws,

3948
02:55:35,510 --> 02:55:39,380
Shark attacks in New Jersey.
Because it was all in fresh water.

3949
02:55:39,560 --> 02:55:42,680
That's what's fucked up about it.
It wasn't even like the movie jaws where

3950
02:55:42,681 --> 02:55:46,500
it was actually in the ocean.
Like these people had no idea that.

3951
02:55:46,550 --> 02:55:49,340
No idea.
Nineteen 16.

3952
02:55:51,080 --> 02:55:54,170
Imagine all that.
People were like babies back then.

3953
02:55:54,500 --> 02:55:59,500
They didn't know shit.
They just landed on the coast of 

3954
02:55:59,500 --> 02:56:00,320
America.
Nineteen 16.

3955
02:56:00,321 --> 02:56:02,120
How long you've been there?
You know?

3956
02:56:02,121 --> 02:56:04,400
17,
76 to 1916.

3957
02:56:04,460 --> 02:56:07,220
People just got their no airplane there.
A hundred years.

3958
02:56:07,370 --> 02:56:09,080
Yeah,
it's crazy.

3959
02:56:09,860 --> 02:56:14,600
Like thanked 1916 in 2017 when you can 
sit back and think about it.

3960
02:56:14,870 --> 02:56:18,440
Nineteen 16 was essentially a 100 years 
ago.

3961
02:56:18,441 --> 02:56:23,080
One hundred one years ago and just a 
hundred years before that you got 18,

3962
02:56:23,100 --> 02:56:25,430
1600 years before that you got 17.
16.

3963
02:56:25,700 --> 02:56:30,700
So it's like the beginning of the 
country still hunt couple of hundred 

3964
02:56:30,700 --> 02:56:32,210
years into the beginning of the country 
and that was just 100 years ago.

3965
02:56:33,020 --> 02:56:34,190
Great.
White Shark attack.

3966
02:56:34,191 --> 02:56:36,310
Five people near the Jersey shore.
Huh?

3967
02:56:36,370 --> 02:56:41,370
This is a different story.
Unless they called it a great white 

3968
02:56:41,370 --> 02:56:42,560
shark and it was a bull shark.
Is that.

3969
02:56:44,970 --> 02:56:47,850
I think that's different.
I think that's a different story.

3970
02:56:48,150 --> 02:56:53,150
There was a bunch of attacks on a river 
in New Jersey in the early 19 hundreds.

3971
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:56,370
I don't think that's the one.
I think that's a different one.

3972
02:56:56,580 --> 02:57:01,580
There's obviously been a bunch of 
attacks spring lake and into twin creek 

3973
02:57:02,070 --> 02:57:04,080
zen.
It rode great white.

3974
02:57:04,440 --> 02:57:06,660
But uh,
but the one that's a great wide.

3975
02:57:06,661 --> 02:57:07,650
Huh?
That's different.

3976
02:57:07,770 --> 02:57:11,190
I thought it was a bull shark.
That's just what this says.

3977
02:57:11,820 --> 02:57:12,930
Hmm.
What's,

3978
02:57:12,931 --> 02:57:15,270
when's the story from the stores?
Is Nineteen Sixteen,

3979
02:57:15,580 --> 02:57:17,340
2012.
Well,

3980
02:57:17,360 --> 02:57:19,800
if it's in the Smithsonian,
you gotta think that's probably right.

3981
02:57:19,920 --> 02:57:21,720
I could've swore it was bull sharks 
though.

3982
02:57:21,980 --> 02:57:25,290
And it killed more than one person 
either way.

3983
02:57:25,291 --> 02:57:27,120
Fuck sharks,
right?

3984
02:57:28,830 --> 02:57:30,150
Yeah.
I don't fuck with the ocean.

3985
02:57:30,510 --> 02:57:31,560
Do you go fishing?
No,

3986
02:57:31,810 --> 02:57:32,790
no,
I didn't do it.

3987
02:57:32,880 --> 02:57:34,410
Now I'll probably get into it for my 
son.

3988
02:57:34,800 --> 02:57:35,970
I'll probably get into it.
He likes it,

3989
02:57:36,150 --> 02:57:38,490
but I ain't trying to go way out in the 
ocean.

3990
02:57:38,491 --> 02:57:43,491
I have no desire and it goes.
I like watching it on dvds and shit the 

3991
02:57:43,491 --> 02:57:47,331
deep.
And you know that the deepest part of 

3992
02:57:47,331 --> 02:57:47,331
the ocean,
like,

3993
02:57:47,331 --> 02:57:47,331
I forget what it's called,
James Cameron,

3994
02:57:47,331 --> 02:57:48,840
where he goes down that submarine.
There's like A.

3995
02:57:49,020 --> 02:57:50,820
There's like a trench.
Yes.

3996
02:57:51,020 --> 02:57:56,020
I like shit like that.
There's a lot of mysterious shit that 

3997
02:57:56,020 --> 02:57:56,020
goes on there.
Do you know where the best place to go?

3998
02:57:56,020 --> 02:57:58,020
Shark fishing in the world is South 
Africa right off.

3999
02:57:58,021 --> 02:58:01,710
Catalina really did.
It's one of the best in the world.

4000
02:58:01,711 --> 02:58:04,620
They catch these giant Maaco sharks and 
they taste good.

4001
02:58:04,680 --> 02:58:07,530
You can eat them for those people get 
mad at you though.

4002
02:58:07,620 --> 02:58:09,630
That's a new thing.
People get mad if you.

4003
02:58:09,631 --> 02:58:11,460
If you eat sharks,
if you kill sharks,

4004
02:58:11,570 --> 02:58:12,390
he will get mad.
Yeah,

4005
02:58:12,391 --> 02:58:13,740
they shouldn't be mad at that.
But they,

4006
02:58:13,741 --> 02:58:15,690
they don't get mad if you killed like a 
tuna.

4007
02:58:16,560 --> 02:58:21,560
Tuna's okay.
But sharks are bad because people have 

4008
02:58:21,560 --> 02:58:22,860
been brainwashed into thinking that 
people eat shark fin soup and they waste

4009
02:58:22,861 --> 02:58:27,861
the shark.
So then people start thinking of shark 

4010
02:58:27,861 --> 02:58:28,110
fishing.
Like they think of trophy hunting.

4011
02:58:28,360 --> 02:58:30,570
I think of like killing lions or 
something like that.

4012
02:58:30,571 --> 02:58:35,571
You're just killing it for no reason.
You're not eating it like they don't 

4013
02:58:35,571 --> 02:58:38,600
realize they go shop for food you like,
nobody does a Japanese do now they just 

4014
02:58:38,600 --> 02:58:43,341
kill them.
They kill them because they're getting 

4015
02:58:43,341 --> 02:58:45,081
in the way of their tune and production 
to the trailing the eight and they make 

4016
02:58:45,081 --> 02:58:46,970
Dolphin Burger's really?
Yep.

4017
02:58:47,260 --> 02:58:49,350
Ooh,
seems wrong.

4018
02:58:50,160 --> 02:58:53,190
They trap them in a cove and just 
fucking Harpoon into math.

4019
02:58:53,340 --> 02:58:55,470
When they were doing that,
they were just killing them because they

4020
02:58:55,471 --> 02:58:57,330
were getting in the way of their tune.
That only shit.

4021
02:58:57,360 --> 02:58:59,700
They're not going to just waste that.
That set.

4022
02:59:00,710 --> 02:59:03,180
Have you watched?
I've seen a documentary.

4023
02:59:03,181 --> 02:59:05,850
It could be bullshit,
but seem legit,

4024
02:59:05,851 --> 02:59:07,650
but isn't it weird?
It feels weird,

4025
02:59:07,651 --> 02:59:08,780
right?
Like eating a,

4026
02:59:09,240 --> 02:59:11,520
eating a dolphin seems fucked up.
The Japanese,

4027
02:59:11,521 --> 02:59:13,560
like they were totally into killing 
whales all the time.

4028
02:59:13,561 --> 02:59:14,860
Or do they still do whaling?
Yeah,

4029
02:59:16,080 --> 02:59:17,250
that's pretty fucked up.
Right?

4030
02:59:17,550 --> 02:59:19,680
Definitely.
They use it for all kinds of stuff,

4031
02:59:19,681 --> 02:59:21,150
right.
They would eat the whale blubber,

4032
02:59:21,410 --> 02:59:22,800
you know,
one of the things they do now,

4033
02:59:22,890 --> 02:59:23,710
they,
um,

4034
02:59:23,760 --> 02:59:28,710
they should kill whales under the false 
pretense of a.

4035
02:59:28,770 --> 02:59:33,770
they're trying to do scientific research
that allowed to do some scientific 

4036
02:59:33,770 --> 02:59:38,391
research on whales,
so they kill a few whales and then they 

4037
02:59:38,391 --> 02:59:40,020
take those whales,
they kill and they sell whatever parts.

4038
02:59:41,320 --> 02:59:44,490
Smart gangster.
The illuminati.

4039
02:59:44,491 --> 02:59:46,230
I'd be like green,
like that shit.

4040
02:59:46,320 --> 02:59:47,970
That's a good one.
I think it's a little monotony.

4041
02:59:47,971 --> 02:59:51,600
I think it's a Japanese fishing market 
that's always been doing that.

4042
02:59:51,810 --> 02:59:55,110
They've been selling and buying and 
killing whales forever,

4043
02:59:55,350 --> 02:59:58,520
and so then when these new environmental
standards got raised,

4044
02:59:58,680 --> 02:59:59,220
they said,
oh yeah,

4045
02:59:59,221 --> 03:00:01,830
well we have to do a little research you
to do a little research.

4046
03:00:02,070 --> 03:00:04,920
Perfect.
Those that company or that group,

4047
03:00:04,921 --> 03:00:06,560
the sea shepherds,
do you know who they are?

4048
03:00:06,610 --> 03:00:11,610
They're the ones who bust people who 
were wailing in illegal whaling because 

4049
03:00:11,610 --> 03:00:15,081
otherwise you gotta think you find some 
whaling boat in the middle of the 

4050
03:00:15,081 --> 03:00:18,291
fucking ocean.
Think I begged the goddamn ocean is 

4051
03:00:18,291 --> 03:00:19,270
there's a boat out there somewhere in 
the middle of it that's whaling.

4052
03:00:19,500 --> 03:00:20,580
How are you going to find them?
What are you gonna?

4053
03:00:20,581 --> 03:00:25,581
Do they go out there and ram these boats
and they'd shoot like air guns or 

4054
03:00:25,581 --> 03:00:25,581
something like that?

4055
03:00:25,581 --> 03:00:26,790
Don't like water,
water,

4056
03:00:26,791 --> 03:00:31,791
guns.
They do a bunch of shit to try to 

4057
03:00:31,791 --> 03:00:32,040
disrupt it and then they try to expose.
Isn't there a TV show about it?

4058
03:00:32,270 --> 03:00:35,260
Think so.
Whale warriors or some point.

4059
03:00:35,450 --> 03:00:37,530
They shouldn't be fucking with whales 
and dolphins.

4060
03:00:39,140 --> 03:00:41,050
Yeah,
they're too smart and I was okay.

4061
03:00:41,520 --> 03:00:42,100
Cows.
Okay.

4062
03:00:42,120 --> 03:00:44,670
Chickens or cows or dom.
Hey chicken.

4063
03:00:44,940 --> 03:00:49,940
Not that gum.
Have you seen those videos of the cows 

4064
03:00:49,940 --> 03:00:49,940
that they kind of loose?
Yeah,

4065
03:00:49,940 --> 03:00:51,100
they get.
We're in a slaughterhouse.

4066
03:00:51,240 --> 03:00:53,700
They send them like they're smarter than
we think.

4067
03:00:54,880 --> 03:00:56,110
What about octopus?
Also?

4068
03:00:56,140 --> 03:01:01,140
Definitely happy.
And you go to some restaurants and you 

4069
03:01:01,140 --> 03:01:01,140
can eat a live octopus.
He just boil them.

4070
03:01:01,300 --> 03:01:02,860
That's fucked up.
Tying restaurant.

4071
03:01:02,861 --> 03:01:07,861
They had it on the menu last night.
Grilled Octopus of how we've talked 

4072
03:01:07,861 --> 03:01:08,430
about it on the podcast.
They're smart as fuck.

4073
03:01:08,500 --> 03:01:11,120
They are smart as fuck,
but you know,

4074
03:01:11,220 --> 03:01:11,740
look at that.

4075
03:01:12,310 --> 03:01:17,310
They're smart.
It's going to go through a whole lot of 

4076
03:01:17,310 --> 03:01:17,650
tiny little tiny asshole.
Right?

4077
03:01:18,670 --> 03:01:20,650
Where's the hole?
The hole in the wall.

4078
03:01:21,260 --> 03:01:23,500
I got obsessed with octopus videos for 
law.

4079
03:01:23,530 --> 03:01:24,550
I want more.
I want,

4080
03:01:24,570 --> 03:01:29,570
I want.
They've got a poor fuck NASA and 

4081
03:01:29,570 --> 03:01:31,741
$18,000,000,000
put some more money into octopuses 

4082
03:01:31,741 --> 03:01:31,741
octopuses dolphins,
monkeys.

4083
03:01:31,840 --> 03:01:35,450
Whereas that thing going out the boat.
Whoa.

4084
03:01:35,580 --> 03:01:37,010
Is going through that hole in the wall.
Yep.

4085
03:01:37,810 --> 03:01:39,790
Right out the side of the boat.
Why I get that shit.

4086
03:01:39,850 --> 03:01:44,850
That's an alien life form.
I mean I might as well be from another 

4087
03:01:44,850 --> 03:01:44,850
planet.
Yeah.

4088
03:01:44,850 --> 03:01:45,850
Have you found that on another planet?
You'd be so excited.

4089
03:01:46,240 --> 03:01:51,240
She the one that guy released it into 
the water and it like came up and it 

4090
03:01:51,240 --> 03:01:51,700
said it came up to thank him.
Look at that shit.

4091
03:01:51,910 --> 03:01:56,910
It's hard to tell if that was piling out
of that crack too slowly.

4092
03:01:57,640 --> 03:02:02,640
That head com impressing itself had the 
brand and everything that has to worry 

4093
03:02:02,801 --> 03:02:07,801
about is the beak.
I don't think they have like a classic 

4094
03:02:07,801 --> 03:02:08,950
brain like we think of.
Look at that.

4095
03:02:09,220 --> 03:02:14,220
That's nuts.
Through a little tiny hole right at the 

4096
03:02:14,220 --> 03:02:14,220
end of it.
Scoop it up with a net psych.

4097
03:02:16,210 --> 03:02:19,180
He tried too hard,
but I saw a common bitch.

4098
03:02:19,600 --> 03:02:22,660
It's crazy.
Eat Octopus.

4099
03:02:22,720 --> 03:02:23,630
Yeah.
Damn.

4100
03:02:24,430 --> 03:02:29,430
I think dad does too.
I don't think there's some octopus 

4101
03:02:29,430 --> 03:02:29,430
attack.
Yeah,

4102
03:02:29,430 --> 03:02:30,850
I don't think they're nice north.
I think Canada,

4103
03:02:30,910 --> 03:02:33,370
they're worried that were assholes and 
they're probably right,

4104
03:02:33,640 --> 03:02:36,370
but I don't think there's a lot of 
morals going on the octopus community.

4105
03:02:36,700 --> 03:02:39,640
Do you ever see that one video of 
octopuses that were taken out?

4106
03:02:39,641 --> 03:02:43,250
Sharks in an aquarium.
They had this big ass aquarium.

4107
03:02:43,270 --> 03:02:44,500
They kept missing sharks.
They're like,

4108
03:02:44,501 --> 03:02:49,501
what the fuck is going on?
Like someone's killing our sharks and 

4109
03:02:49,501 --> 03:02:52,801
then they put a video.
They set it up and I found that the 

4110
03:02:52,801 --> 03:02:53,200
octopus always get busted with cameras.
Right.

4111
03:02:53,880 --> 03:02:58,880
There's so many hidden camera videos 
like pet octopuses getting out of their 

4112
03:02:58,880 --> 03:02:58,880
aquarium.
Oh yeah.

4113
03:02:58,980 --> 03:03:03,980
And going into another aquarium,
a jack in the fish and then climbing 

4114
03:03:03,980 --> 03:03:03,980
back in.

4115
03:03:03,980 --> 03:03:05,370
Look at this.
Do they attack each other as attack each

4116
03:03:05,371 --> 03:03:06,850
other?
That's a very good question.

4117
03:03:06,910 --> 03:03:08,920
Octopus wars.
I'm sure they have them.

4118
03:03:08,921 --> 03:03:10,300
Right.
Look how he fucks.

4119
03:03:10,301 --> 03:03:13,300
This shark doesn't have a chance.
It's a tiny shark.

4120
03:03:13,660 --> 03:03:16,630
It is a baby.
It's like a toddler still doesn't have a

4121
03:03:16,631 --> 03:03:21,631
chance.
Do you know that they feel like they're 

4122
03:03:21,631 --> 03:03:24,340
pretty sure that they found fossil 
evidence of enormous suction cups,

4123
03:03:24,341 --> 03:03:29,341
which would indicate that at one point 
in time there was a thing like a 

4124
03:03:29,341 --> 03:03:32,090
cracking,
like an enormous hundred foot long 

4125
03:03:32,090 --> 03:03:35,580
octopus.
I believe that the private I'd probably 

4126
03:03:35,580 --> 03:03:35,580
still exists probably.
Right?

4127
03:03:35,580 --> 03:03:39,460
We don't know shit about the ocean.
Will you see those giant squids right 

4128
03:03:39,460 --> 03:03:39,460
here?
She knows.

4129
03:03:39,460 --> 03:03:40,540
Yeah.
You ever seen that one?

4130
03:03:40,541 --> 03:03:42,580
They found when they had one of those 
offshore,

4131
03:03:42,630 --> 03:03:45,330
uh,
offshore oil,

4132
03:03:45,340 --> 03:03:46,060
uh,
things.

4133
03:03:46,061 --> 03:03:47,380
One of those things.
Do they have it on Youtube?

4134
03:03:47,381 --> 03:03:48,820
Giant squid.
What's that?

4135
03:03:48,910 --> 03:03:53,680
Offshore oil rig.
Alien Squid or the biggest,

4136
03:03:54,790 --> 03:03:57,310
the biggest squid.
They found this fucking square.

4137
03:03:57,311 --> 03:03:58,010
That one.
They didn't

4138
03:03:58,010 --> 03:04:03,010
even know this thing existed until they 
had a camera set up and look at that 

4139
03:04:03,010 --> 03:04:05,330
fucking thing.
It's got like crab legs.

4140
03:04:05,600 --> 03:04:08,630
They found this enormous giant squid in 
the ocean.

4141
03:04:08,660 --> 03:04:12,290
They didn't even know it existed until 
they got this video look.

4142
03:04:12,300 --> 03:04:13,220
A pig.
That shit.

4143
03:04:13,221 --> 03:04:17,470
It's huge.
It's like it has like a mom's like,

4144
03:04:17,480 --> 03:04:20,690
go back to that image Jamie and freeze 
on it.

4145
03:04:20,691 --> 03:04:25,691
Like it's hard to tell.
We did something like a boat next to it 

4146
03:04:25,691 --> 03:04:25,691
or it's hard to tell how big it is.
Well,

4147
03:04:25,691 --> 03:04:28,220
they've caught them.
They've caught giant squid now.

4148
03:04:28,221 --> 03:04:33,221
The giant squid used to be like a rumor.
They used to find dead ones 

4149
03:04:33,221 --> 03:04:36,431
occasionally,
but now that's thrown them and caught 

4150
03:04:36,431 --> 03:04:36,431
them.
Yeah,

4151
03:04:36,431 --> 03:04:37,280
it's huge man.
What it looks like an alien.

4152
03:04:37,670 --> 03:04:41,060
Like that thing looks like an alien.
Like liquid is like crab,

4153
03:04:41,061 --> 03:04:42,410
like legs where it bends.

4154
03:04:42,460 --> 03:04:45,330
I want to how smart pr they should do.
Some experiments.

4155
03:04:45,331 --> 03:04:47,390
Some giant squids.
Maybe they're just stupid.

4156
03:04:47,780 --> 03:04:51,140
Octopus are smart and they're just good 
for Sushi there.

4157
03:04:51,141 --> 03:04:52,820
Make a hell of a Sushi.
Tell you that.

4158
03:04:52,880 --> 03:04:55,940
I liked squid Sushi like it.
You don't like Sushi?

4159
03:04:56,120 --> 03:04:58,370
I don't like seafood at all.
I like to.

4160
03:04:58,610 --> 03:05:01,910
I like canned tuna.
Sardines no fucking way.

4161
03:05:01,911 --> 03:05:03,470
I said Shit.
Ever Oysters?

4162
03:05:03,770 --> 03:05:05,570
Hell no,
but I do like.

4163
03:05:05,600 --> 03:05:10,190
I do like black cod or is it black cod 
gets from the east.

4164
03:05:10,310 --> 03:05:13,760
It's like racist.
I see what it says.

4165
03:05:13,761 --> 03:05:15,230
I don't like.
White is black cod.

4166
03:05:15,650 --> 03:05:17,180
They serve.
It tastes like candy.

4167
03:05:17,420 --> 03:05:18,950
I like that.
So I know what you're talking about.

4168
03:05:18,951 --> 03:05:20,630
You're talking about like me,
so cod.

4169
03:05:21,080 --> 03:05:21,980
Yeah.
I don't know if it's me.

4170
03:05:21,981 --> 03:05:23,810
So I think it's called black cod.
Yeah,

4171
03:05:23,811 --> 03:05:28,811
black cod with like a miso dressing.
So a lot of Asian restaurants here.

4172
03:05:28,940 --> 03:05:30,620
I love that.
It tastes fishy.

4173
03:05:30,621 --> 03:05:32,090
Like Salmon.
I don't like that shit.

4174
03:05:32,120 --> 03:05:35,660
Trout a really not into.
I don't know man.

4175
03:05:36,230 --> 03:05:39,880
You met under very different taste.
I wish I wasn't do it.

4176
03:05:39,881 --> 03:05:42,500
God Damn you don't even.
She sounds so much fun.

4177
03:05:42,520 --> 03:05:45,830
Like what am I showing?
Gives me organ meat.

4178
03:05:46,220 --> 03:05:47,990
Liver.
So good for you.

4179
03:05:48,470 --> 03:05:53,110
I want shit that doesn't remind me that 
it's used to be an animal living.

4180
03:05:53,111 --> 03:05:54,960
No desire.
That's why like Mcdonald's,

4181
03:05:54,961 --> 03:05:59,961
because I know that shit ain't meet 
eventually,

4182
03:06:00,320 --> 03:06:05,320
but if you were on a farm,
have you are on a farm and the only way 

4183
03:06:05,320 --> 03:06:06,470
to eat you had to shoot a cow and 
butcher it and grind it up.

4184
03:06:06,590 --> 03:06:07,970
How would you handle that?
Because you do it.

4185
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:09,470
I'd get used to it.
You get used to it.

4186
03:06:09,830 --> 03:06:10,990
I'm sure I would.
If I had to eat.

4187
03:06:11,350 --> 03:06:12,350
I was starving.

4188
03:06:12,640 --> 03:06:16,340
You Go Vegan or would you just kill the 
cows?

4189
03:06:17,390 --> 03:06:19,520
What was the choice again?
Go Vegan.

4190
03:06:20,390 --> 03:06:22,800
I'm going to get all your food from the 
farm I got to get.

4191
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:23,720
Okay.
Yeah.

4192
03:06:23,721 --> 03:06:28,721
Let's say if like we're in some,
like a day of the dead fucking.

4193
03:06:29,160 --> 03:06:33,440
I'd had chicken night of the living dead
chickens walking dead Zombie scenario to

4194
03:06:33,441 --> 03:06:34,880
kill chickens.
Chickens.

4195
03:06:34,881 --> 03:06:35,960
No problem.
No problem.

4196
03:06:36,150 --> 03:06:37,480
No problem.
Um,

4197
03:06:37,550 --> 03:06:40,670
you wouldn't kill God.
Put chickens on the planet for us.

4198
03:06:40,671 --> 03:06:43,590
I think animals eat other animals,
right?

4199
03:06:43,610 --> 03:06:48,610
It's true.
That's what we do every day with 

4200
03:06:48,610 --> 03:06:48,610
deciding sleep chickens out there for 
the people.

4201
03:06:49,140 --> 03:06:50,750
Man.
I can't believe the dogs.

4202
03:06:50,990 --> 03:06:53,070
And then like,
Oh shit,

4203
03:06:53,240 --> 03:06:54,890
what the fuck?
Chinese people.

4204
03:06:55,050 --> 03:06:56,010
You have a festival

4205
03:06:56,250 --> 03:06:59,520
which is eating dogs.
How about the Indians think I.

4206
03:06:59,730 --> 03:07:02,580
cows are sacred and we.
And they must think we're fucking crazy.

4207
03:07:02,730 --> 03:07:04,230
Well,
certain parts of India,

4208
03:07:04,231 --> 03:07:04,920
right?
What does that,

4209
03:07:04,980 --> 03:07:07,890
is it just the Hindus?
The think that I think most India.

4210
03:07:07,950 --> 03:07:10,860
What do you think that's from?
Just culture.

4211
03:07:10,980 --> 03:07:13,830
Mushrooms maybe for sure.
Oh,

4212
03:07:13,860 --> 03:07:14,970
that's right.
For sure.

4213
03:07:15,110 --> 03:07:18,330
So this grows out of cow shit.
It only grows out of cows.

4214
03:07:18,331 --> 03:07:20,070
Jet Predominantly.
Really?

4215
03:07:20,130 --> 03:07:21,060
Yeah.
Dan,

4216
03:07:21,061 --> 03:07:23,190
we can find it in field to get a couple 
of cows.

4217
03:07:23,750 --> 03:07:24,720
Chickens,
Shit,

4218
03:07:25,920 --> 03:07:26,640
dude,
are you kidding?

4219
03:07:26,641 --> 03:07:28,680
You make your own mushrooms.
You can get your own mushrooms.

4220
03:07:28,800 --> 03:07:30,780
Mushrooms.
That's right.

4221
03:07:31,150 --> 03:07:33,110
All easy to guess.
You buy kits,

4222
03:07:33,160 --> 03:07:34,230
you know?
What do you mean your closet.

4223
03:07:34,280 --> 03:07:39,280
You know that conspiracy theory that,
that Mcdonald's doesn't actually use 

4224
03:07:39,280 --> 03:07:39,280
real meat,
you know,

4225
03:07:39,280 --> 03:07:42,970
some people call it,
but some people believe it and it's easy

4226
03:07:42,990 --> 03:07:45,930
to believe eventually it's gonna come 
out that they're not.

4227
03:07:46,170 --> 03:07:51,170
They're using some other kind of Shit 
fillers or whatever that it's already 

4228
03:07:51,170 --> 03:07:51,780
admit they use some sort of filler.
Yeah,

4229
03:07:51,790 --> 03:07:56,790
but they're not.
They're not admitting that they're not 

4230
03:07:56,790 --> 03:07:56,790
using meat.
That Mcdonald's has never said.

4231
03:07:56,790 --> 03:07:57,840
We don't use meat.
Hold on.

4232
03:07:57,841 --> 03:08:02,841
What the mcrib what do they say?
That same compound that they say is 

4233
03:08:02,841 --> 03:08:04,750
using yoga mats or something that fake 
rubber come,

4234
03:08:04,751 --> 03:08:08,070
come on,
but they're not.

4235
03:08:08,071 --> 03:08:10,050
Mcdonald's is not out there saying,
hey,

4236
03:08:10,051 --> 03:08:12,390
we don't use real meat.
They're saying 100 percent beef.

4237
03:08:12,420 --> 03:08:13,960
Dude.
I just got commercials.

4238
03:08:14,360 --> 03:08:19,360
Yeah,
but they don't say that for about the a 

4239
03:08:19,360 --> 03:08:21,410
day saying $100,
but here's a conspiracy theory is that 

4240
03:08:21,410 --> 03:08:22,440
hundred per 100 percent beef is actually
just the name.

4241
03:08:22,441 --> 03:08:23,810
It's a trademark.
Oh,

4242
03:08:23,811 --> 03:08:26,010
that's right.
I don't know if that's real.

4243
03:08:26,011 --> 03:08:28,320
I read that.
So when they say 100 percent beef,

4244
03:08:28,500 --> 03:08:31,890
that's just the name of the company that
makes the beat.

4245
03:08:31,980 --> 03:08:33,030
I read that.
That was,

4246
03:08:33,270 --> 03:08:34,950
that's the ultimate mind.
Fuck right there,

4247
03:08:34,951 --> 03:08:36,990
right.
You know what they do?

4248
03:08:37,200 --> 03:08:39,810
All they need to do is little by little.
Say Yes.

4249
03:08:39,811 --> 03:08:41,460
We don't use.
We don't use first.

4250
03:08:41,461 --> 03:08:42,240
They have a,
a,

4251
03:08:42,350 --> 03:08:45,720
a,
a fake meat Vegan Burger.

4252
03:08:45,780 --> 03:08:50,780
Yes.
Fake me and slowly tell people inch by 

4253
03:08:50,780 --> 03:08:50,780
inch that.
Oh yeah.

4254
03:08:50,780 --> 03:08:51,690
We don't use real mean brill.
Meat's bad for you.

4255
03:08:51,691 --> 03:08:54,330
It causes cancer.
Why would we're we're helping you.

4256
03:08:54,420 --> 03:08:57,150
We're trying to save you.
If you don't want to eat meat.

4257
03:08:57,240 --> 03:09:02,240
I feel like that was shut down.
I think 100 percent real beef was like 

4258
03:09:02,240 --> 03:09:06,801
shut down like that.
They were trying to make a product 

4259
03:09:06,801 --> 03:09:08,880
called 100 percent real beef.
What a sneaky fucking loophole.

4260
03:09:09,090 --> 03:09:10,920
What kind of shocked.
Yeah,

4261
03:09:11,020 --> 03:09:13,200
no I'm not,
but what kind of a monster would do that

4262
03:09:13,740 --> 03:09:18,740
create a fake meat and call it a 100 
percent real beef and that was the name 

4263
03:09:18,740 --> 03:09:18,780
of the meat,
like you know,

4264
03:09:18,781 --> 03:09:19,590
what's your dog's name?

4265
03:09:19,710 --> 03:09:21,450
Oh,
my dog's name is 100 percent real beef.

4266
03:09:21,630 --> 03:09:24,000
Like just naming it right?
You just make it a name.

4267
03:09:24,660 --> 03:09:27,090
That's so fucking sneaky.
Is that true?

4268
03:09:27,330 --> 03:09:28,160
I don't know.
It could be a.

4269
03:09:28,260 --> 03:09:30,030
It could be a myth.
It's not true.

4270
03:09:30,040 --> 03:09:33,920
Jamie,
same listeners into subway,

4271
03:09:33,930 --> 03:09:35,100
Newsweek,
McDonald's,

4272
03:09:37,010 --> 03:09:42,010
Mcdonald's.
Try to copyright the term 100 percent 

4273
03:09:42,010 --> 03:09:45,090
real beef and use it on,
on Patty's that weren't just all beef.

4274
03:09:45,780 --> 03:09:48,960
I think they did.
I feel like someone did that.

4275
03:09:49,020 --> 03:09:50,970
I don't know if it was Mcdonald's,
but I feel like you're right.

4276
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:54,490
I feel surprised if it's true,
but it could be a hoax.

4277
03:09:54,790 --> 03:09:55,950
I remember it.
You know,

4278
03:09:56,110 --> 03:09:57,670
it's hard to tell what's real these 
days.

4279
03:09:58,880 --> 03:10:01,330
We can look on snopes,
but nobody trusts them anymore.

4280
03:10:01,680 --> 03:10:02,650
It was false,
but I won't.

4281
03:10:03,390 --> 03:10:05,860
I'll find another source.
What a snopes.

4282
03:10:06,060 --> 03:10:08,550
Can't trust false.
What do they say about what's.

4283
03:10:08,551 --> 03:10:12,010
What's caused the rumor mill?
Snopes is and what's false?

4284
03:10:12,011 --> 03:10:12,880
They're saying,
don't do this,

4285
03:10:12,940 --> 03:10:14,050
don't do it.
Don't do it.

4286
03:10:14,260 --> 03:10:17,050
You can wait.
You're hungry or you train it again.

4287
03:10:17,051 --> 03:10:17,620
How's your back?

4288
03:10:18,230 --> 03:10:20,080
My knees fucked up.
It popped out again.

4289
03:10:20,090 --> 03:10:25,090
Saturday I did a seminar in oceanside,
10 panadols and strategy side and it 

4290
03:10:25,090 --> 03:10:29,591
fucking popped out again.
I was on the floor and then this time I 

4291
03:10:29,591 --> 03:10:33,170
was like,
I can't squat down for a long time 

4292
03:10:33,170 --> 03:10:34,550
because I was squatting down giving Kyle
bame a brown belt out there.

4293
03:10:34,570 --> 03:10:36,170
He's,
he's a bad ass grappler.

4294
03:10:36,740 --> 03:10:41,740
I was just giving him some hot rubber 
guard advice while I was squatting on 

4295
03:10:41,740 --> 03:10:43,280
the balls of my feet and you're on the 
balls of your feet and it blew out there

4296
03:10:43,290 --> 03:10:44,750
and I went.
When I stood up,

4297
03:10:44,751 --> 03:10:49,751
that's how blood originally and when I 
stood up the thing popped out and I'm 

4298
03:10:49,751 --> 03:10:49,751
like,
Oh shit.

4299
03:10:49,751 --> 03:10:53,770
Coming in.
I was in serious pain and then I 

4300
03:10:53,770 --> 03:10:53,990
straighten up my leg and it popped back 
in.

4301
03:10:54,080 --> 03:10:59,080
Man,
I'm going to need surgery because the 

4302
03:10:59,080 --> 03:11:02,051
doctor said for six weeks because that 
happened six weeks ago and the doctor 

4303
03:11:02,051 --> 03:11:06,941
said,
make sure you don't do anything stupid 

4304
03:11:06,941 --> 03:11:09,530
on it for the next six weeks because if 
it pops out again,

4305
03:11:09,800 --> 03:11:13,490
my acl was hanging on by a thread.
It's probably all gone now.

4306
03:11:14,270 --> 03:11:19,270
That's probably all gone.
My knees fucked up so I'm going to need 

4307
03:11:19,270 --> 03:11:19,270
surgery.
I'm just going to do it,

4308
03:11:19,270 --> 03:11:20,390
but meanwhile I'm just going to lift 
hard.

4309
03:11:20,450 --> 03:11:25,450
I'm just gonna.
Make sure while my knees recovering my 

4310
03:11:25,450 --> 03:11:25,450
upper body as strong as hell.

4311
03:11:25,450 --> 03:11:27,190
Dr Mcgee,
Dr Rodney Mcgee.

4312
03:11:27,340 --> 03:11:28,120
Yeah,
I talked to him.

4313
03:11:28,240 --> 03:11:33,240
He didn't have a new way of attaching 
the acl where they don't have to give 

4314
03:11:33,240 --> 03:11:34,000
you a cadaver graft anymore.
When did you talk to them?

4315
03:11:34,400 --> 03:11:37,270
Uh,
before it popped out again.

4316
03:11:37,300 --> 03:11:38,320
So I need to talk to them again.

4317
03:11:38,630 --> 03:11:39,800
This is what they're doing now.
They're,

4318
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:43,160
they're changing the recovery times 
drastically because the old way,

4319
03:11:43,200 --> 03:11:44,980
what they do is they take a cadaver 
graft,

4320
03:11:44,981 --> 03:11:47,330
right?
So they'd take a piece out of a dead guy

4321
03:11:47,331 --> 03:11:50,780
or they'd take your hamstrings,
Patella the Patella.

4322
03:11:50,781 --> 03:11:52,670
Don and I had to get the advert done.
What's better?

4323
03:11:52,671 --> 03:11:56,490
You think the cadaver but the cadaver it
can get infected and then it gets real.

4324
03:11:56,491 --> 03:11:58,790
I've never heard of that APP.
That's a problem.

4325
03:11:59,080 --> 03:12:01,310
I haven't had it happen to me.
Mine was.

4326
03:12:01,640 --> 03:12:03,890
Mine went super smooth.
I did all my rehab.

4327
03:12:03,920 --> 03:12:05,590
I did a good job of the Rehab.
I was.

4328
03:12:05,850 --> 03:12:07,640
DABBING is good.
It's great.

4329
03:12:07,750 --> 03:12:10,070
It's great.
My cadaver knee doesn't bother me even a

4330
03:12:10,071 --> 03:12:11,390
little.
You had acl?

4331
03:12:11,420 --> 03:12:12,740
Both directions.
Both.

4332
03:12:12,741 --> 03:12:13,940
Both.
Holy Shit.

4333
03:12:13,990 --> 03:12:15,350
Yeah.
And you see what I can do.

4334
03:12:15,390 --> 03:12:17,440
My legs.
What year?

4335
03:12:17,441 --> 03:12:19,190
[inaudible] 94 with the Patella tendon 
graft.

4336
03:12:19,191 --> 03:12:22,550
Two thousand three with the uh,
acl with the counselor when I got.

4337
03:12:23,630 --> 03:12:28,630
That was when I got my biggest when I'm 
was the first one was done with the 

4338
03:12:28,630 --> 03:12:30,020
Patella graphs that a hamstring?
No.

4339
03:12:30,080 --> 03:12:31,820
And then the second one in 2003 was 
done.

4340
03:12:31,821 --> 03:12:33,410
Cadaver Cadaver?
Yeah.

4341
03:12:33,580 --> 03:12:35,330
In both knees are good.
Oh yeah.

4342
03:12:35,360 --> 03:12:36,380
They don't pop out?
No.

4343
03:12:36,410 --> 03:12:41,410
Did it pop out?
Is that how it ripped before slid out 

4344
03:12:41,410 --> 03:12:41,410
it?
Well,

4345
03:12:41,410 --> 03:12:42,410
the first one felt um,
I,

4346
03:12:42,510 --> 03:12:47,510
I tore it kicking the bag.
I was tired and I was doing rounds on 

4347
03:12:47,510 --> 03:12:48,950
the bag and I threw a kick and my leg 
was planted and it didn't.

4348
03:12:48,951 --> 03:12:51,080
My foot didn't pivot.
I was just doing rounds,

4349
03:12:51,140 --> 03:12:54,410
was real tired.
I was trying to put it out exactly.

4350
03:12:54,411 --> 03:12:59,411
And I was 21 and I think I'd heard it 
before then I just didn't realize how 

4351
03:12:59,411 --> 03:12:59,510
bad I'd heard it.
And then I heard it again.

4352
03:12:59,511 --> 03:13:04,511
It popped like I felt it explode in the 
gym and then I went to the hospital and 

4353
03:13:05,121 --> 03:13:06,670
they checked it out and the whole deal.

4354
03:13:06,670 --> 03:13:08,110
And,
and uh,

4355
03:13:08,220 --> 03:13:10,700
I've eventually got it fixed.
And then the other one.

4356
03:13:11,180 --> 03:13:11,870
No,
you know what?

4357
03:13:11,960 --> 03:13:15,140
I heard it a couple different ways.
But Anyway,

4358
03:13:15,200 --> 03:13:17,000
point is it,
it blew out.

4359
03:13:17,290 --> 03:13:19,640
Um,
my second one that I got done,

4360
03:13:19,880 --> 03:13:23,060
it was introduced to class.
I was in half guard,

4361
03:13:23,090 --> 03:13:26,180
I was on top and someone had the lock 
down sideways.

4362
03:13:26,720 --> 03:13:28,550
So instead of straightening me out 
normal,

4363
03:13:28,760 --> 03:13:33,760
like,
you know where your leg bends and 

4364
03:13:33,760 --> 03:13:33,760
extends it hyper extends,
it went this way,

4365
03:13:33,760 --> 03:13:37,840
like against the side of the knee.
And it just was a weird angle and he 

4366
03:13:37,840 --> 03:13:38,510
straightened his leg out and it just 
popped up.

4367
03:13:38,870 --> 03:13:42,500
You can hear it snap like a carrot snap.
And I didn't even know it was broken.

4368
03:13:42,920 --> 03:13:47,920
I thought it was just really painful.
And then the next day I was actually 

4369
03:13:47,920 --> 03:13:47,920
walking around.
Okay.

4370
03:13:48,140 --> 03:13:50,720
And I didn't think anything was wrong.
I thought it was just really sore.

4371
03:13:50,900 --> 03:13:53,900
And then I was moving some stuff around 
in my office and it just went.

4372
03:13:54,710 --> 03:13:56,420
It just fell out of the socket.
Slipped out,

4373
03:13:56,421 --> 03:13:57,170
gave out?
Yeah.

4374
03:13:57,320 --> 03:14:02,320
Just gave out.
And I knew that feeling before because 

4375
03:14:02,320 --> 03:14:05,351
of my other knee.
And then did you have to straighten it 

4376
03:14:05,351 --> 03:14:05,351
out and pop it back in?
No,

4377
03:14:05,351 --> 03:14:05,351
it didn't.
That wasn't a problem because it wasn't.

4378
03:14:05,351 --> 03:14:06,800
There was no meniscus tear on the right 
one.

4379
03:14:06,980 --> 03:14:09,260
The left one had meniscus tear as well.
Remember?

4380
03:14:09,261 --> 03:14:11,220
One time I blew that out in class and I 
was like,

4381
03:14:11,300 --> 03:14:12,680
my leg locked.
Do you remember that?

4382
03:14:12,681 --> 03:14:13,580
And you had to drive my car.

4383
03:14:14,600 --> 03:14:19,080
Forget that he drove me to the doctor 
and driving your Nsx,

4384
03:14:19,360 --> 03:14:21,450
a stick shift.
And I was grinding the gears.

4385
03:14:21,960 --> 03:14:23,820
Your knee was tore apart.
You were like,

4386
03:14:24,540 --> 03:14:26,620
you're fucking piss driving,
you know,

4387
03:14:26,650 --> 03:14:29,790
because your knee and I'm fucking up 
your car and you're like,

4388
03:14:29,800 --> 03:14:33,000
what the fuck are you doing?
Don't you go to fucking driver's stick?

4389
03:14:33,001 --> 03:14:33,420
I'm like,
dude,

4390
03:14:33,421 --> 03:14:36,890
I haven't driven a stick and forever 
it's sticks.

4391
03:14:36,891 --> 03:14:38,790
Sticks to the easel about automatics,
baby.

4392
03:14:38,791 --> 03:14:40,830
It's 2017 and people would still got 
sticks.

4393
03:14:40,890 --> 03:14:42,490
What the fuck is going on?
All my cars and.

4394
03:14:42,510 --> 03:14:44,400
Come on man.
I love sticks.

4395
03:14:44,450 --> 03:14:46,260
I supposed to text.
I don't know.

4396
03:14:46,261 --> 03:14:51,261
I'm kidding.
That's not a good job.

4397
03:14:51,720 --> 03:14:52,110
Yo.
Yo.

4398
03:14:52,111 --> 03:14:52,660
Yo.
Get in.

4399
03:14:52,661 --> 03:14:53,630
Wrecks.
Protects stage.

4400
03:14:53,631 --> 03:14:54,310
Do.
Yeah.

4401
03:14:54,530 --> 03:14:55,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

4402
03:14:55,200 --> 03:14:57,150
How many people have been in wrecks 
while they're facetiming?

4403
03:14:57,270 --> 03:14:58,860
I saw some good face time and on the 
highway.

4404
03:14:59,100 --> 03:15:02,760
I've seen a couple people do it.
Facetime and while they're driving him,

4405
03:15:02,890 --> 03:15:05,400
I'm gonna.
Give you that sweet Dick Mama Way.

4406
03:15:05,840 --> 03:15:07,110
Yeah.
That's incredible.

4407
03:15:07,111 --> 03:15:09,540
I love driving stick shifts though.
I prefer it.

4408
03:15:10,640 --> 03:15:15,640
I don't like it.
Maybe you would like it if you drove a 

4409
03:15:15,640 --> 03:15:18,971
sports car.
Why don't you get one of those engines 

4410
03:15:18,971 --> 03:15:21,221
that you crank like in 1910 and you 
liked that you control the anymore.

4411
03:15:21,570 --> 03:15:26,570
If they made them,
you would get them maybe what have you 

4412
03:15:26,570 --> 03:15:26,570
had to start your car by cranking?
Yeah,

4413
03:15:26,570 --> 03:15:29,390
but you don't feel like there's some fun
and shifting the gears.

4414
03:15:29,480 --> 03:15:33,030
I know what it was like,
you know,

4415
03:15:33,050 --> 03:15:37,730
what it was,
is my first car was a 1977 pinto station

4416
03:15:37,731 --> 03:15:41,120
wagon and I got it for $550 and it was a
stick shift.

4417
03:15:41,210 --> 03:15:42,900
I always wanted,
uh,

4418
03:15:43,130 --> 03:15:44,780
the cheaper cars were always stick 
shift.

4419
03:15:44,810 --> 03:15:49,810
I could only afford to stick shift.
The more expensive cars had the 

4420
03:15:49,810 --> 03:15:49,810
automatic.
And I guess it was just,

4421
03:15:49,810 --> 03:15:49,980
I was

4422
03:15:49,980 --> 03:15:51,480
brainwashed into thinking,
fuck,

4423
03:15:51,481 --> 03:15:55,020
one of these days I'm going to be able 
to drive an automatic fuck this bag.

4424
03:15:55,021 --> 03:15:58,260
You will bullshit.
And I think it was just a mind fuck.

4425
03:15:58,350 --> 03:16:01,170
So once I was,
once I got my first automatic car,

4426
03:16:01,171 --> 03:16:03,280
Mike Fox stick shift,
you could just,

4427
03:16:03,900 --> 03:16:06,960
I had a bunch of automatics and then I 
got a stick shift.

4428
03:16:07,350 --> 03:16:10,350
I had a bunch of muscle cars and then I 
got an Audi.

4429
03:16:10,351 --> 03:16:15,351
Fox is a tiny little Audi car.
It was a little front wheel drive car 

4430
03:16:17,010 --> 03:16:20,060
and it was a stick shift.
It was like a zippy little car like me.

4431
03:16:20,850 --> 03:16:21,810
I loved it.
I was like,

4432
03:16:21,870 --> 03:16:24,150
Ooh,
I love like shifting the gears,

4433
03:16:24,330 --> 03:16:29,330
but it wasn't until I got my first NSX,
Nsx,

4434
03:16:29,850 --> 03:16:34,850
Nsx in 95 or six,
maybe 97,

4435
03:16:35,350 --> 03:16:39,060
97 and then I had another one that I got
in like 2004.

4436
03:16:39,350 --> 03:16:40,290
It was a bad ass car.

4437
03:16:40,380 --> 03:16:43,050
Love those things.
They're so different now.

4438
03:16:43,440 --> 03:16:48,210
Now the new NSX is like this big 
technological spaceship thing.

4439
03:16:48,270 --> 03:16:49,410
I like it.
It's dope.

4440
03:16:49,690 --> 03:16:51,450
It's going.
I don't think so,

4441
03:16:51,690 --> 03:16:53,280
but it's a different thing.
I liked.

4442
03:16:53,340 --> 03:16:55,370
I liked the little cars that you can.
You're,

4443
03:16:55,400 --> 03:16:58,050
you're in control of like a,
like A.

4444
03:16:58,140 --> 03:17:03,140
I don't like the big electronic car.
That's why I like the Porsche because 

4445
03:17:03,140 --> 03:17:05,160
that thing's light.
It's light and you control everything.

4446
03:17:05,161 --> 03:17:07,350
You feel it.
You feel the road like,

4447
03:17:07,360 --> 03:17:09,900
like if you're in a sports car for me,
like a fast car,

4448
03:17:10,110 --> 03:17:12,810
you want to feel everything.
Makes it exciting.

4449
03:17:12,840 --> 03:17:15,150
You don't get any of that Shit,
I dunno.

4450
03:17:15,240 --> 03:17:18,510
Maybe don't even like liver or was that.
You don't even like liver.

4451
03:17:18,620 --> 03:17:20,760
Like you and I are very different.
Oh No,

4452
03:17:20,770 --> 03:17:22,290
no,
I didn't let you sliced hearts.

4453
03:17:22,330 --> 03:17:25,760
There is an Nsx that looks incredible 
leadership.

4454
03:17:25,920 --> 03:17:27,210
It's already out.
Oh yeah.

4455
03:17:27,780 --> 03:17:31,170
Not only is an out.
They just released an Nsx gt three,

4456
03:17:31,500 --> 03:17:34,260
so if you want to race,
if you want to be a racecar driver,

4457
03:17:34,380 --> 03:17:36,750
they'll sell you one of those and it 
costs a half a million bucks.

4458
03:17:36,810 --> 03:17:39,270
Holy Shit.
It's a beast of a car man.

4459
03:17:39,600 --> 03:17:41,610
And the thing is,
it's a Honda.

4460
03:17:41,790 --> 03:17:44,520
I'm going to call it an Acura,
but it's a Honda,

4461
03:17:44,820 --> 03:17:49,620
which means is this not going to break?
You could drive that thing forever.

4462
03:17:49,830 --> 03:17:54,830
Those things will have unbelievable 
reliability as opposed to like say a car

4463
03:17:55,471 --> 03:17:57,950
that my ancestors made.
You know,

4464
03:17:57,951 --> 03:17:59,970
you get something Italian,
good luck.

4465
03:17:59,971 --> 03:18:04,971
But is it really Japanese?
If they're making it in Mexico as they 

4466
03:18:04,971 --> 03:18:05,490
megan that Mexico,
don't they make Honda's in Mexico?

4467
03:18:05,750 --> 03:18:07,730
Toyota's.
That's what I thought.

4468
03:18:07,740 --> 03:18:12,740
Then.
I know they make some of them in 

4469
03:18:12,740 --> 03:18:12,740
America.
They make nissans and that's even worse.

4470
03:18:12,740 --> 03:18:12,740
Really.

4471
03:18:15,960 --> 03:18:17,310
That's a good question.
Right?

4472
03:18:17,311 --> 03:18:20,100
Is it considered.
Now we're talking about breaking down.

4473
03:18:21,340 --> 03:18:23,820
There's a awesome American cars,
but yeah,

4474
03:18:23,821 --> 03:18:28,821
but if they just use standards developed
by the Japanese and once they have 

4475
03:18:28,821 --> 03:18:29,640
standards developed by the Japanese,
like what does it say?

4476
03:18:29,710 --> 03:18:31,200
I'm making them in Ohio,
Ohio.

4477
03:18:31,410 --> 03:18:32,010
Oh,
that's right.

4478
03:18:32,011 --> 03:18:33,960
The NSX is being made in Ohio.
That's right.

4479
03:18:34,020 --> 03:18:35,580
I forgot about that.
Is that good or bad?

4480
03:18:35,670 --> 03:18:40,670
Was real good for Americans in Ohio.
We want a good job making sex as far as 

4481
03:18:40,891 --> 03:18:42,930
a reliability.
You know what?

4482
03:18:42,931 --> 03:18:45,060
Everything's automated now.
See that's the thing.

4483
03:18:45,061 --> 03:18:47,680
It's not like you're.
You're dealing with skilled craftsman.

4484
03:18:47,681 --> 03:18:49,480
You're dealing with programmers and 
shit,

4485
03:18:49,910 --> 03:18:53,230
but like assembly line should have some.
There's some.

4486
03:18:53,231 --> 03:18:57,250
That was the thing about the corvette 
factory in Bowling Green,

4487
03:18:57,251 --> 03:18:58,930
Kentucky.
Like those people,

4488
03:18:58,931 --> 03:19:01,360
they've put together those corvettes by 
themselves.

4489
03:19:01,361 --> 03:19:05,380
Like there's a lot that's going on 
that's a animated automated rather.

4490
03:19:05,380 --> 03:19:07,810
But there's a lot that's going on by 
hand to get this shit.

4491
03:19:07,870 --> 03:19:10,060
This is crazy.
They're making cars.

4492
03:19:10,510 --> 03:19:12,400
So what is this guy doing right here 
with this thing?

4493
03:19:12,880 --> 03:19:13,620
The factory,
I don't know,

4494
03:19:13,621 --> 03:19:15,280
I just kind of skipped ahead.
Yeah.

4495
03:19:15,281 --> 03:19:17,770
What's happening here?
It's hard to tell what it is.

4496
03:19:19,060 --> 03:19:20,710
They're flipping the thing upside down.
Oh,

4497
03:19:20,711 --> 03:19:23,260
they're working on the chassis.
This is the bottom of the car.

4498
03:19:23,440 --> 03:19:28,440
These things are just what they are now.
That's what the car looks like on the 

4499
03:19:28,440 --> 03:19:30,220
inside before they put the seats in the 
drive train and all that stuff,

4500
03:19:30,540 --> 03:19:34,060
but with these things are now it's all 
done by these robots.

4501
03:19:34,061 --> 03:19:36,580
Someone controlling it real time or is 
it on a program?

4502
03:19:36,600 --> 03:19:39,220
It's a good question.
I would bet it's probably on a program.

4503
03:19:40,030 --> 03:19:43,570
There's probably someone controlling it,
but they're probably just pressing start

4504
03:19:43,990 --> 03:19:48,990
it.
Probably lock it into place and this 

4505
03:19:48,990 --> 03:19:48,990
thing,
I mean the way it's stacking everything,

4506
03:19:49,020 --> 03:19:49,290
hold on.

4507
03:19:49,300 --> 03:19:54,300
Some of the things that they're doing 
now though mean these cars are so 

4508
03:19:54,300 --> 03:19:58,951
precise.
They're so different than anything that 

4509
03:19:58,951 --> 03:19:59,440
existed like 20,
30 years ago.

4510
03:19:59,920 --> 03:20:03,190
Like this car,
it might not be like the most,

4511
03:20:04,430 --> 03:20:06,850
the fastest,
best engineered cars in the world,

4512
03:20:06,851 --> 03:20:11,851
but it's one of them and it's just that 
the horsepower wars are so out of 

4513
03:20:11,851 --> 03:20:15,811
control right now that a car like this 
is almost kind of overlooked because 

4514
03:20:15,811 --> 03:20:19,060
there's so many insane high performance 
cars now.

4515
03:20:19,090 --> 03:20:23,260
I mean there's so many that are zero to 
60 in three seconds.

4516
03:20:24,460 --> 03:20:29,460
What they're doing now is just making 
these unbelievable spaceships that are 

4517
03:20:29,460 --> 03:20:31,330
regular person could buy.
If you have the money.

4518
03:20:31,420 --> 03:20:36,420
You don't have to be a race car driver.
You don't have to be like super 

4519
03:20:36,420 --> 03:20:40,831
qualified to handle this thing.
You could just get a car that's 600 

4520
03:20:40,831 --> 03:20:43,420
horsepower,
four wheel drive drives like a demon.

4521
03:20:43,690 --> 03:20:46,490
I mean you could just go out and buy it.
The Tesla,

4522
03:20:46,491 --> 03:20:48,430
the model three,
it's like 35 grand,

4523
03:20:48,431 --> 03:20:49,510
right?
Crazy.

4524
03:20:50,270 --> 03:20:53,290
Yeah.
You're buying a model three,

4525
03:20:53,370 --> 03:20:55,270
oh,
you're buying a fucking spaceship.

4526
03:20:55,720 --> 03:21:00,720
Like everything is automated.
This guy's a using torque wrenches that 

4527
03:21:00,720 --> 03:21:01,870
everything's all set to the exact amount
you're supposed to crank.

4528
03:21:01,871 --> 03:21:05,320
Things like everything is.
Nothing is left to the imagination.

4529
03:21:05,500 --> 03:21:08,140
You know?
It's cool to make like an old classics,

4530
03:21:08,141 --> 03:21:10,120
like a new version,
like the charger and all that.

4531
03:21:10,220 --> 03:21:10,640
Yeah,
yeah.

4532
03:21:11,380 --> 03:21:14,280
Do model t's in a new version.
They,

4533
03:21:14,380 --> 03:21:19,380
those things are so like ergonomically 
clumsy and so poorly designed in terms 

4534
03:21:20,021 --> 03:21:25,021
of like aerodynamics and shit.
If you try to take a model t on the 

4535
03:21:25,021 --> 03:21:25,360
highway,
that shit would just fall over.

4536
03:21:25,780 --> 03:21:27,880
Like once you got to like add,
make it right though.

4537
03:21:27,910 --> 03:21:29,860
But the wind resistance,
you get to like 80.

4538
03:21:29,860 --> 03:21:31,840
You're not trying to go fast.
It's just like a,

4539
03:21:31,870 --> 03:21:33,100
like a Harley.
Oh,

4540
03:21:33,160 --> 03:21:34,870
like a cruiser,
right?

4541
03:21:35,080 --> 03:21:36,340
Yeah.
Maybe.

4542
03:21:36,610 --> 03:21:37,420
I mean they,
they go,

4543
03:21:37,540 --> 03:21:39,940
they had those cruisers that,
those fifties type cars.

4544
03:21:39,941 --> 03:21:41,550
Right?
Like dragster things.

4545
03:21:41,590 --> 03:21:42,910
What are they called?
Pt cruisers.

4546
03:21:43,120 --> 03:21:44,230
Oh yeah.
That thing,

4547
03:21:44,470 --> 03:21:49,470
that thing was,
I drove one of those ones there were so 

4548
03:21:49,470 --> 03:21:52,241
bad.
It was like you guys just made a cool 

4549
03:21:52,241 --> 03:21:53,510
outside and through the shittiest 
suspension you could.

4550
03:21:53,511 --> 03:21:55,970
It was so bad,
like every time I go around a corner the

4551
03:21:55,971 --> 03:22:00,320
ass and would like kick out and I took 
it on a dirt road and I was like,

4552
03:22:00,410 --> 03:22:03,440
I could fly off the side of this road 
and not being able to control this piece

4553
03:22:03,441 --> 03:22:04,770
of shit.
Right.

4554
03:22:05,540 --> 03:22:06,620
Oh,
those were pretty dope.

4555
03:22:06,650 --> 03:22:11,650
That was the PR plymoth prowler.
Is that like based on like a fifties 

4556
03:22:11,650 --> 03:22:12,590
style car?
Sort of.

4557
03:22:12,620 --> 03:22:16,460
That was created by chip foose.
He's the guy that did the design element

4558
03:22:16,490 --> 03:22:21,490
of my 1970 Barracuda who's a wizard car 
designer guy.

4559
03:22:22,251 --> 03:22:23,930
He invented a bunch of different cool 
cars.

4560
03:22:24,320 --> 03:22:28,320
They had that thing that plymoth prowler
and there was another one that was kinda

4561
03:22:28,340 --> 03:22:29,480
like that too,
wasn't there.

4562
03:22:29,530 --> 03:22:32,230
It was in another one of those fucking 
retro looking things.

4563
03:22:34,220 --> 03:22:39,220
Either you don't have kids.
If you have a car like that or you're a 

4564
03:22:39,220 --> 03:22:40,100
shitty father,
that's your weekend car.

4565
03:22:40,110 --> 03:22:45,110
What?
Take my weekend car and driving around 

4566
03:22:45,110 --> 03:22:45,110
the neighborhood.

4567
03:22:45,270 --> 03:22:50,270
See your super rich and you can do that 
every now and then you put it in your 

4568
03:22:50,270 --> 03:22:50,990
side garage.
That's the thunderbird.

4569
03:22:51,710 --> 03:22:54,930
I think foose was involved in that too,
guys.

4570
03:22:55,230 --> 03:22:58,520
Goddamn car wizard.
Yeah.

4571
03:22:58,580 --> 03:23:00,440
That's a nice one.
Is that a falcon?

4572
03:23:00,620 --> 03:23:02,030
No,
that's a t bird.

4573
03:23:02,360 --> 03:23:03,590
That's a.
that's a thunderbird,

4574
03:23:03,591 --> 03:23:08,591
but it has a roof on it.
Have they made newer versions of 

4575
03:23:08,591 --> 03:23:08,591
Falcons?
Hm.

4576
03:23:08,591 --> 03:23:11,900
I don't think so.
Was the last time at mit a falcon in the

4577
03:23:11,901 --> 03:23:13,340
sixties?
Look at that thing above.

4578
03:23:13,341 --> 03:23:14,220
It was that.
Does that,

4579
03:23:14,221 --> 03:23:15,920
that movie from that movie?
Christine,

4580
03:23:15,921 --> 03:23:17,780
that one on the right.
The second one on the right.

4581
03:23:18,140 --> 03:23:18,860
The Red One?
Yeah.

4582
03:23:18,861 --> 03:23:20,700
Look at that.
What about cars like they should make?

4583
03:23:20,720 --> 03:23:21,670
No,
that's a thunder road.

4584
03:23:21,680 --> 03:23:22,720
Look at that thing.
God.

4585
03:23:22,730 --> 03:23:27,730
What about new cars like that?
Like those look like the limousine that 

4586
03:23:27,730 --> 03:23:27,730
JFK was in.

4587
03:23:27,730 --> 03:23:29,420
Right?
Just a little shorter.

4588
03:23:29,570 --> 03:23:31,760
That's a thunderbird.
Look how bad ass that is.

4589
03:23:32,390 --> 03:23:37,390
That's like if you roll around on that 
and Hollywood like if you're some sort 

4590
03:23:37,390 --> 03:23:40,970
of Rockstar type character and you got a
Goddamn and you're like,

4591
03:23:40,971 --> 03:23:42,780
look at me,
motherfucker,

4592
03:23:43,300 --> 03:23:46,160
look at this shit.
Look at my white walls.

4593
03:23:46,580 --> 03:23:49,280
Look at that thing and that is a slick 
ride.

4594
03:23:49,310 --> 03:23:54,310
Go back to that last one jamie.
That is a slick looking car man.

4595
03:23:55,310 --> 03:23:57,940
What year is that?
It's a for Thunderbird,

4596
03:23:57,950 --> 03:23:59,510
right?
Second Generation.

4597
03:23:59,540 --> 03:24:02,990
Second Generation.
That means if I had to guess,

4598
03:24:03,320 --> 03:24:05,700
I'd say that's like 1960 something.
Right.

4599
03:24:06,470 --> 03:24:09,500
Crazy looking cars.
Like they figured it out.

4600
03:24:09,890 --> 03:24:14,180
They back then man,
they had just caught a design groove and

4601
03:24:14,181 --> 03:24:18,290
figured out how to make these really 
exotic looking sexy shapes.

4602
03:24:19,580 --> 03:24:21,290
Fifty nine.
Wow.

4603
03:24:21,800 --> 03:24:23,810
Amazing.
What a car.

4604
03:24:23,840 --> 03:24:28,840
There's a lot of remixes possible here 
for Florida and are wondering should 

4605
03:24:28,840 --> 03:24:33,730
they do that or should they?
They did that two charges and it was a 

4606
03:24:33,730 --> 03:24:36,520
huge grand slam.
Have you seen the new m four that got 

4607
03:24:36,520 --> 03:24:37,820
now the Ford Gt,
the new Ford Gt.

4608
03:24:38,030 --> 03:24:42,890
Jesus Christ Ford's came out with a car 
that's like a Super Ferrari looking car.

4609
03:24:43,440 --> 03:24:43,950
Let me say it.

4610
03:24:44,010 --> 03:24:46,830
I think it's like $300,000
for that thing.

4611
03:24:46,831 --> 03:24:48,120
Yup.
That's a Ford.

4612
03:24:48,121 --> 03:24:49,500
Come on.
Holy Shit.

4613
03:24:49,501 --> 03:24:51,930
Holy Shit.
It's about God damn time.

4614
03:24:51,931 --> 03:24:53,340
They could have did that a long time 
ago.

4615
03:24:53,341 --> 03:24:57,000
I get that thing.
They should have did that 20 years ago.

4616
03:24:57,450 --> 03:24:57,990
That's.
See,

4617
03:24:57,991 --> 03:25:01,380
that's like whatever the NSX is,
450,

4618
03:25:01,381 --> 03:25:04,620
$3,000.
You need to get one of those.

4619
03:25:04,630 --> 03:25:05,690
Oh,
come on.

4620
03:25:06,740 --> 03:25:11,740
It's not even a standard.
You got an automatic transmission and 

4621
03:25:11,740 --> 03:25:12,270
shit.
The old ones,

4622
03:25:12,271 --> 03:25:15,210
these dev stick to old for the dad.
What the hell?

4623
03:25:15,211 --> 03:25:18,600
That's the only 3 million bucks.
It's gold plated.

4624
03:25:18,601 --> 03:25:20,580
One driving down sunset.
Why not?

4625
03:25:20,910 --> 03:25:25,910
If I had one of those I never played and
I would have like three d videos of my 

4626
03:25:25,910 --> 03:25:29,560
dick that like play all over the car.
It's like you're.

4627
03:25:29,620 --> 03:25:34,620
You're a hard dick.
Is like a Hologram on led screens that 

4628
03:25:34,620 --> 03:25:34,980
are all over the car.

4629
03:25:35,310 --> 03:25:35,960
Do,
do,

4630
03:25:35,970 --> 03:25:36,570
do,
do,

4631
03:25:36,571 --> 03:25:37,080
do,
do,

4632
03:25:37,081 --> 03:25:37,680
do,
do.

4633
03:25:38,010 --> 03:25:43,010
Imagine if a dude drove down the street 
and he had a Bugatti with like the 

4634
03:25:43,010 --> 03:25:44,770
outside of the car was a screen.
What did they make?

4635
03:25:44,771 --> 03:25:48,570
Only one dick was a $3 million.
It's got 1500 horsepower.

4636
03:25:49,980 --> 03:25:54,980
It's a status symbol.
It's one of those things where people 

4637
03:25:54,980 --> 03:25:54,980
want to show everybody that they don't 
even give a fuck.

4638
03:25:54,980 --> 03:25:55,740
They drive around a $3,000,000
car,

4639
03:25:56,120 --> 03:26:01,040
whether it's got a gang of them,
but ace hood has a song called I will go

4640
03:26:01,070 --> 03:26:06,070
bed and I woke up and I saw one drive 
down by the comedy store once and 

4641
03:26:08,951 --> 03:26:09,760
everybody looked,
oh,

4642
03:26:09,761 --> 03:26:11,800
that's a million dollars.
That's a million dollars.

4643
03:26:11,880 --> 03:26:14,610
It used to be a million.
Now the three used to be.

4644
03:26:14,611 --> 03:26:16,890
That was for the first million dollar 
car,

4645
03:26:16,891 --> 03:26:18,840
so a million dollar car.
Look at this.

4646
03:26:19,130 --> 03:26:22,020
My book is for sale for 4 million for 
that neighborhood.

4647
03:26:22,230 --> 03:26:23,050
That's fully.
Meanwhile,

4648
03:26:23,940 --> 03:26:25,890
money made,
whether it's in the dupont registry,

4649
03:26:25,920 --> 03:26:29,970
he's selling it for fucking 4 million.
You want to be a baller.

4650
03:26:30,240 --> 03:26:31,680
Want to drive around and floyd 
mayweather.

4651
03:26:32,160 --> 03:26:34,650
He does that often.
He flips cars.

4652
03:26:34,830 --> 03:26:38,160
Are you kidding me?
Money buy a for to sell it for,

4653
03:26:38,161 --> 03:26:40,280
for not only that,
it's a good movement.

4654
03:26:40,920 --> 03:26:42,030
It's a smart move,
right?

4655
03:26:42,400 --> 03:26:43,910
Cars.
Are you kidding with social media?

4656
03:26:43,920 --> 03:26:46,390
He says he's his own corporation.
Yeah,

4657
03:26:47,400 --> 03:26:48,900
no,
it's a smart move.

4658
03:26:49,230 --> 03:26:51,000
What's that?
He's pissed over low ball bids.

4659
03:26:51,001 --> 03:26:54,190
That is Bugatti auction in his face.
He's a man.

4660
03:26:55,320 --> 03:26:57,630
One point five,
one point $9,000,000

4661
03:26:57,631 --> 03:27:02,631
bid,
because the number was still much lower 

4662
03:27:02,631 --> 03:27:02,631
than floyd was hoping to get.
I wonder what he paid for.

4663
03:27:02,631 --> 03:27:05,270
It didn't sell.
Somebody offered one point $9 million.

4664
03:27:05,290 --> 03:27:07,770
He's like not enough.
Whoa.

4665
03:27:07,990 --> 03:27:11,850
Reportedly paid three point $5 million.
Oh my goodness.

4666
03:27:12,180 --> 03:27:16,250
So it was reported he was expecting to 
make a profit and someone tried to short

4667
03:27:16,260 --> 03:27:16,450
them.

4668
03:27:16,600 --> 03:27:18,600
The same one.
Now this is the white one.

4669
03:27:18,720 --> 03:27:20,550
The one we just saw was the black one.
Oh,

4670
03:27:20,551 --> 03:27:21,810
okay.
Yeah.

4671
03:27:21,811 --> 03:27:25,290
The only people that could afford that 
or people don't give a shit about that.

4672
03:27:25,670 --> 03:27:27,000
Well,
I think floyd is just.

4673
03:27:27,090 --> 03:27:30,060
His whole thing is about just being the 
oldest baller guys,

4674
03:27:30,160 --> 03:27:35,160
guys,
guys that are in the memorabilia there 

4675
03:27:35,160 --> 03:27:35,250
usually broke.
They don't have that much money.

4676
03:27:35,620 --> 03:27:38,220
Come on.
That's not a memorabilia thing.

4677
03:27:38,400 --> 03:27:40,110
One hundred people on the planet could 
have,

4678
03:27:40,200 --> 03:27:41,740
could afford to do that.
You know what I mean?

4679
03:27:42,160 --> 03:27:45,520
And they're not impressed by having 
someone celebrity.

4680
03:27:45,640 --> 03:27:47,690
You know what I mean?
They are.

4681
03:27:48,220 --> 03:27:51,970
It's more than 100 millionaire.
A billionaire is going to be going to be

4682
03:27:51,971 --> 03:27:54,730
treated that it's a floyd mayweather,
his car,

4683
03:27:55,310 --> 03:27:58,690
but it's obvious that it's flipping it 
like they're too smart for that shit,

4684
03:27:58,720 --> 03:28:02,170
but if they wanted to get it and drive 
around and let everybody know in 2013 it

4685
03:28:02,171 --> 03:28:05,620
says they sold their 400th day.
Ron Jesus.

4686
03:28:06,160 --> 03:28:11,160
So 400 people have bought go out of 400.
Over a million dollars.

4687
03:28:13,540 --> 03:28:15,220
Jesus,
that's a lot of money.

4688
03:28:15,940 --> 03:28:20,410
Four hundred million dollars at cars.
I wonder what it costs to actually make.

4689
03:28:20,470 --> 03:28:24,610
What do you think?
50 Bucks and it cost like $20,000

4690
03:28:24,611 --> 03:28:25,450
in my house.
Okay,

4691
03:28:25,451 --> 03:28:28,420
let's get this.
I bet this a website that shows how much

4692
03:28:28,421 --> 03:28:30,580
does it actually cost to build a 
Bugatti?

4693
03:28:30,581 --> 03:28:33,580
I want to say $300,000.
I'm going to say

4694
03:28:36,550 --> 03:28:39,900
because it's so expensive that the 
people making it will charge more.

4695
03:28:40,000 --> 03:28:42,610
You know what I mean?
Because it's probably going to be

4696
03:28:45,380 --> 03:28:46,770
$300,000.
Oh,

4697
03:28:46,870 --> 03:28:48,410
you agree with me?
What did you say?

4698
03:28:48,411 --> 03:28:49,580
I said $300.
Wait a minute.

4699
03:28:49,940 --> 03:28:50,320
Oh,
I ripped.

4700
03:28:50,340 --> 03:28:50,930
Perfect.
Well,

4701
03:28:50,931 --> 03:28:52,310
we'll see if we're right.
We'll see if for both.

4702
03:28:52,311 --> 03:28:57,311
Right?
I think that's a reasonable reasonable 

4703
03:28:57,311 --> 03:29:00,221
thing to imply.
For Volkswagen loses six point two $5 

4704
03:29:00,621 --> 03:29:03,530
million on each one.
They sell what Volkswagen loses.

4705
03:29:03,540 --> 03:29:05,270
What?
Wait a minute.

4706
03:29:06,560 --> 03:29:09,770
They lose 6 million when they sell it 
for 3 million,

4707
03:29:10,190 --> 03:29:12,290
so it costs $9.
Million to make.

4708
03:29:12,410 --> 03:29:14,730
I'm looking.
There are lying now.

4709
03:29:14,731 --> 03:29:16,910
There's never.
You would never know.

4710
03:29:17,350 --> 03:29:19,160
I'm going over to Eddie Bravo side on 
this one.

4711
03:29:19,820 --> 03:29:21,020
Tower.
This tower seven.

4712
03:29:21,140 --> 03:29:23,130
No bullshit.
Call Me Illuminati.

4713
03:29:23,640 --> 03:29:28,640
Illuminati.
Slamming this guy with a friend of mine 

4714
03:29:28,640 --> 03:29:32,440
was illuminating.
Do people get tired of talking 

4715
03:29:32,440 --> 03:29:33,890
conspiracy theories with you?
Do they get tired?

4716
03:29:34,010 --> 03:29:35,550
No.
They always want to bring it up and hide

4717
03:29:35,570 --> 03:29:37,440
it.
Usually a good thing to talk about,

4718
03:29:37,470 --> 03:29:39,380
a good way for a young guy to approach 
you.

4719
03:29:39,520 --> 03:29:41,060
Hey Eddie,
I'm with you on Tarceva.

4720
03:29:41,830 --> 03:29:43,000
I'm with you with the flat earth,
Bro.

4721
03:29:43,001 --> 03:29:44,370
Hey Bro.
Check it out.

4722
03:29:44,810 --> 03:29:49,810
Lights you see?
Pretty freaked me to the guy a guy came 

4723
03:29:49,810 --> 03:29:52,160
up to me with is like 12 year old 
daughter and they were all like that all

4724
03:29:52,161 --> 03:29:54,290
into flat earth.
Twelve year olds and I go,

4725
03:29:54,291 --> 03:29:56,150
do you talk about flat earth at school?
She goes,

4726
03:29:56,151 --> 03:30:01,151
now they all think I'm crazy.
When I wanted to just give her the 

4727
03:30:02,391 --> 03:30:04,520
benefit of the doubt into it.
Hey,

4728
03:30:05,360 --> 03:30:10,360
is it really that much money?
Here's the other cars that sit there in 

4729
03:30:10,360 --> 03:30:12,050
a 17 year low with European cars.
Well,

4730
03:30:12,051 --> 03:30:14,130
there's lots of the last makers.
There's the biggest one.

4731
03:30:14,220 --> 03:30:18,560
It says smart cars.
Those are pieces of shit.

4732
03:30:19,270 --> 03:30:22,220
It's quite different vehicle $4,000
because of the economy.

4733
03:30:22,280 --> 03:30:25,580
They could be going into like the 
development costs and like all the money

4734
03:30:25,581 --> 03:30:28,790
that had to spend testing everything 
fucked right now.

4735
03:30:28,791 --> 03:30:33,791
Right.
Vw is fuck because they got caught 

4736
03:30:33,791 --> 03:30:35,741
lying.
I think I caught lying about a fuel 

4737
03:30:35,741 --> 03:30:35,741
emissions or.
Yeah,

4738
03:30:36,290 --> 03:30:39,880
about uh,
the fuel mileage of their

4739
03:30:40,010 --> 03:30:42,860
cars.
And it's also about the missions now.

4740
03:30:42,861 --> 03:30:45,770
Apparently they'd just been lying about 
that shit for a long time.

4741
03:30:46,760 --> 03:30:49,420
Stuff like who's telling the truth 
anywhere.

4742
03:30:49,421 --> 03:30:52,870
Like when it hit that level at the super
crazy high level,

4743
03:30:52,871 --> 03:30:54,830
they try to sell cars to.
They're like,

4744
03:30:54,831 --> 03:30:56,990
how do we sell these cars?
People don't give a shit.

4745
03:30:57,320 --> 03:31:00,910
Just tell them whatever study,
say you know,

4746
03:31:01,370 --> 03:31:05,510
science report,
say just whatever you have any desire to

4747
03:31:05,511 --> 03:31:07,840
drive around in some ball car.
Fuck yeah.

4748
03:31:08,550 --> 03:31:11,990
I'm not though.
I have like one,

4749
03:31:12,650 --> 03:31:14,200
one,
$500,

4750
03:31:14,210 --> 03:31:15,940
million of the money you have.
I don't,

4751
03:31:15,950 --> 03:31:16,920
I'm,
I'm not.

4752
03:31:17,030 --> 03:31:22,030
I'm driving a Tundra Tundra.
Good fucking car.

4753
03:31:22,580 --> 03:31:24,500
I like it.
Those get Toyota trucks.

4754
03:31:24,530 --> 03:31:26,570
I got it from my favorite shit for my 
baby.

4755
03:31:26,571 --> 03:31:27,170
I'm like,
you know,

4756
03:31:27,470 --> 03:31:32,470
I had a beemer before that and I'm like,
I'm not going to put a baby seat in the 

4757
03:31:32,470 --> 03:31:32,470
beamer.

4758
03:31:32,470 --> 03:31:35,320
I'm loaded tank.
Say about the biggest Tundra with the 

4759
03:31:35,320 --> 03:31:36,230
biggest cab.
The biggest one I could find.

4760
03:31:36,380 --> 03:31:39,460
Put that baby seat right in the middle.
So He's been,

4761
03:31:39,500 --> 03:31:42,020
thing happens.
God forbid he's gonna make it.

4762
03:31:42,080 --> 03:31:44,450
You know what else they do if you're,
if you're into this,

4763
03:31:44,510 --> 03:31:47,090
they make side sliders on those cars 
there.

4764
03:31:47,091 --> 03:31:50,600
They actually act as a side impact.
Protection in what?

4765
03:31:50,740 --> 03:31:52,820
What do you call rock slider.
So they,

4766
03:31:52,821 --> 03:31:57,821
uh,
they'll raise the car up a few inches 

4767
03:31:57,821 --> 03:31:58,130
and put these rock sliders on the side 
of these cars.

4768
03:31:58,131 --> 03:32:03,131
They do it a lot with land cruisers and 
they offer significant side impact 

4769
03:32:03,131 --> 03:32:04,230
protection.
I need to met what cars have that.

4770
03:32:04,460 --> 03:32:05,570
What cars were the,
the,

4771
03:32:06,030 --> 03:32:07,070
the,
the,

4772
03:32:07,220 --> 03:32:10,850
the,
the best when it comes to accidents.

4773
03:32:10,910 --> 03:32:12,470
Accidents.
I would say like a dodge.

4774
03:32:12,471 --> 03:32:14,530
Ram.
Volvo is like known for that,

4775
03:32:14,531 --> 03:32:15,660
right?
Are they still number one,

4776
03:32:15,960 --> 03:32:18,020
they're known for being like real safe 
and accident?

4777
03:32:18,190 --> 03:32:23,190
Yeah.
Maybe somebody hitting you or are they 

4778
03:32:23,190 --> 03:32:23,210
still.
Do they still make the strongest frames?

4779
03:32:23,300 --> 03:32:24,650
Because basically that's what it comes 
down to.

4780
03:32:24,651 --> 03:32:25,860
Who's making the strongest frame?
Right.

4781
03:32:25,930 --> 03:32:30,930
Not just that.
It's also like how the body responds to 

4782
03:32:30,930 --> 03:32:30,930
impact,
how it,

4783
03:32:30,930 --> 03:32:31,550
how it crumples,
how it,

4784
03:32:31,551 --> 03:32:34,370
uh,
how it's engineered delivers the best.

4785
03:32:34,371 --> 03:32:36,350
I'm going to get that.
That's my next car.

4786
03:32:36,530 --> 03:32:40,100
I saw this car accident the other day.
What does that Chevy volt one.

4787
03:32:40,400 --> 03:32:42,920
No way number one.
Top rated number one?

4788
03:32:43,100 --> 03:32:44,000
Yup.
What?

4789
03:32:44,120 --> 03:32:49,120
As far as,
as far as the accident crash test 

4790
03:32:49,120 --> 03:32:49,180
results?
Yeah.

4791
03:32:50,180 --> 03:32:51,200
Wow.
That's crazy.

4792
03:32:51,201 --> 03:32:54,530
What about,
but what about them?

4793
03:32:54,590 --> 03:32:58,120
I would say it would have to be like a 
ram or a Chevy Silverado.

4794
03:32:58,121 --> 03:33:00,330
It's got to be though,
because that's what they specialize in.

4795
03:33:00,360 --> 03:33:01,670
That's their shit.
Yeah,

4796
03:33:01,671 --> 03:33:05,960
but they're not as big like if you get.
Is that number one for suv?

4797
03:33:05,960 --> 03:33:09,560
What about for the number one truck?
What's number one?

4798
03:33:09,590 --> 03:33:10,700
Is that number one?
What is it?

4799
03:33:10,760 --> 03:33:11,870
What does it say?
I'm going to get it.

4800
03:33:13,550 --> 03:33:16,550
10 safest Audi.
Audi.

4801
03:33:16,640 --> 03:33:19,280
Goddamn.
Pop Up ads like Audi right there,

4802
03:33:19,281 --> 03:33:21,980
right?
What is that one?

4803
03:33:21,981 --> 03:33:24,320
That's the Audi shoot.
Something cute.

4804
03:33:24,321 --> 03:33:25,600
Whatever the fuck it is.
Q seven.

4805
03:33:26,600 --> 03:33:31,600
That's pretty cool car.
I've seen one of those before in real 

4806
03:33:31,600 --> 03:33:31,820
life as far as side impacts.
Yeah.

4807
03:33:31,821 --> 03:33:36,821
I think they.
A lot of those cars have airbags and 

4808
03:33:36,821 --> 03:33:38,891
shit now and they just.
Their pillars are designed to a certain 

4809
03:33:38,891 --> 03:33:40,470
amount of impact and they give in with 
stuff too.

4810
03:33:41,070 --> 03:33:46,070
I saw a car accident the other day 
though at an intersection and it was a 

4811
03:33:46,070 --> 03:33:48,660
dodge ram truck in like some little peon
Corolla.

4812
03:33:49,010 --> 03:33:54,010
Ooh.
They hadn't had on the Corolla was 

4813
03:33:54,010 --> 03:33:58,191
destroyed and then when I see people 
driving relative babies and tiny little 

4814
03:33:58,191 --> 03:34:00,450
cars and the car seats like right next 
door.

4815
03:34:00,670 --> 03:34:02,190
Yeah.
It's rather scary.

4816
03:34:02,310 --> 03:34:03,540
That's a scary one,
man.

4817
03:34:03,541 --> 03:34:04,990
One that'll fuck up.
You know what?

4818
03:34:04,991 --> 03:34:06,150
It's amazing.
That's your baby.

4819
03:34:06,180 --> 03:34:08,040
Think about how many cars are on the 
road.

4820
03:34:08,070 --> 03:34:13,070
How rarely they slam into each other.
Most of the time people keep it 

4821
03:34:13,070 --> 03:34:13,070
together.
Most of the time.

4822
03:34:13,070 --> 03:34:17,810
Most of the Times I kind of think the 
traffic kind of filters out bad drivers 

4823
03:34:17,831 --> 03:34:19,590
because bad drivers,
they're not going to laugh.

4824
03:34:19,600 --> 03:34:21,780
They're going to wreck,
so we'll usually.

4825
03:34:21,781 --> 03:34:25,200
We're left with people that have seen 
rex and they're like,

4826
03:34:25,330 --> 03:34:26,670
you know,
once you've been in a wreck,

4827
03:34:26,671 --> 03:34:29,310
fuck,
you're super careful.

4828
03:34:29,340 --> 03:34:31,680
You know,
my mom was in a terrible wreck,

4829
03:34:32,040 --> 03:34:34,350
lost all her front teeth,
terrible wreck,

4830
03:34:34,351 --> 03:34:35,430
and she.
Since then,

4831
03:34:35,460 --> 03:34:39,780
this has been maybe 35 years.
She doesn't drive on the freeway.

4832
03:34:39,990 --> 03:34:41,850
She was like scared of death of the 
freeway.

4833
03:34:42,260 --> 03:34:45,750
It was a horrible,
freely accident and she won't ever drive

4834
03:34:45,751 --> 03:34:50,751
on the freeway.
I've seen some bad ones and bad ones 

4835
03:34:50,751 --> 03:34:50,940
coming home.
Late night from the comedy store,

4836
03:34:50,941 --> 03:34:52,830
cars flipped over,
smashed,

4837
03:34:52,831 --> 03:34:53,550
fucked up.
You know,

4838
03:34:53,551 --> 03:34:54,180
people are dead.

4839
03:34:56,580 --> 03:34:59,750
It happens.
I even get a full call to fucking drunks

4840
03:34:59,820 --> 03:35:00,860
anytime.
We're going to have a mad.

4841
03:35:00,870 --> 03:35:02,730
He was mad and it could happen to 
anybody,

4842
03:35:02,870 --> 03:35:05,610
but he got hit by a train.
He got hit by a train.

4843
03:35:05,611 --> 03:35:09,240
He was trying to cross the train track.
I don't know what the whole story was,

4844
03:35:09,241 --> 03:35:12,030
but he got hit by a fucking train.
How's he doing right now?

4845
03:35:12,060 --> 03:35:13,710
Is Out of the coma apparently.
That's good.

4846
03:35:13,740 --> 03:35:14,730
Yeah.
He's responsive.

4847
03:35:16,230 --> 03:35:18,330
I mean if anybody's going to survive 
something like that,

4848
03:35:18,331 --> 03:35:21,660
it's that fucking tank.
You know guys at tank.

4849
03:35:22,280 --> 03:35:27,280
I mean most.
Most people probably would have been 

4850
03:35:27,280 --> 03:35:27,280
dead.
It's pretty amazing.

4851
03:35:27,280 --> 03:35:28,740
He was in a coma for quite a while.
And what's worth.

4852
03:35:28,770 --> 03:35:33,640
I mean getting attacked by a great white
shark and get eaten or well,

4853
03:35:33,730 --> 03:35:36,150
depends on what comes back from the car 
wreck.

4854
03:35:36,180 --> 03:35:38,250
And he's like that dude from the dead 
zone.

4855
03:35:38,490 --> 03:35:40,620
They could see the future.
Who holds your hands?

4856
03:35:41,020 --> 03:35:43,440
So you're going to run for your money on
John Jones.

4857
03:35:43,950 --> 03:35:45,450
Hold your hands.
You can see the future.

4858
03:35:45,750 --> 03:35:46,920
Right?
What does.

4859
03:35:46,921 --> 03:35:48,870
He just starts predicting fights and 
he's.

4860
03:35:49,350 --> 03:35:50,610
Yeah.
How come this never that.

4861
03:35:50,640 --> 03:35:52,710
Like there were they talking about like 
nuclear fallout.

4862
03:35:52,740 --> 03:35:56,340
How come no one's getting super powers?
Remember when you were a kid comic book,

4863
03:35:56,341 --> 03:35:58,800
if there was a nuclear accident,
you turned into the hulk when you turned

4864
03:35:58,801 --> 03:36:00,660
to spiderman.
It's a radioactive spider.

4865
03:36:00,710 --> 03:36:01,520
Yeah,
right.

4866
03:36:01,770 --> 03:36:02,430
Yeah.
Fuck.

4867
03:36:02,431 --> 03:36:03,550
Today.
Every.

4868
03:36:03,560 --> 03:36:06,180
It's always bad.
There's no like others radiation.

4869
03:36:06,210 --> 03:36:07,860
Whereas yeah.
Where's all the mutations?

4870
03:36:07,920 --> 03:36:10,650
Where's the good mutations?
There's no good mutations.

4871
03:36:11,010 --> 03:36:13,320
No one ever has a good one.
No one ever becomes like Magneto,

4872
03:36:14,130 --> 03:36:15,110
right?
Yeah.

4873
03:36:15,240 --> 03:36:17,970
It's always like you're getting cancer.
There's all this new release cancer fall

4874
03:36:17,971 --> 03:36:18,800
out.
Where is it at?

4875
03:36:19,370 --> 03:36:20,850
You got to go to the places where it's 
at.

4876
03:36:21,270 --> 03:36:23,730
You've received the video of a Shane 
Smith from vice,

4877
03:36:23,940 --> 03:36:24,850
went to,
um,

4878
03:36:25,290 --> 03:36:30,290
went to Chernobyl and they,
they carrying around these radar 

4879
03:36:30,290 --> 03:36:32,400
detectors are these radiation detectors.
It's off the charts,

4880
03:36:32,401 --> 03:36:34,260
man.
They got wolves running around.

4881
03:36:34,350 --> 03:36:36,190
They got cat fish.
They're swimming in the rivers

4882
03:36:36,200 --> 03:36:39,220
that are all mutated and giant.
Are they really mutated?

4883
03:36:40,870 --> 03:36:43,390
I,
I heard skeptical is.

4884
03:36:43,700 --> 03:36:48,310
I'm hearing that there is no mutations 
and it's fake.

4885
03:36:48,940 --> 03:36:50,470
Fake News.
I Dunno.

4886
03:36:50,740 --> 03:36:51,970
I Dunno.
I mean,

4887
03:36:51,971 --> 03:36:53,440
I don't know if you want to hear the 
conspiracy thing.

4888
03:36:53,450 --> 03:36:54,550
I definitely don't.
Okay.

4889
03:36:56,140 --> 03:36:57,010
That's good.
Good thing,

4890
03:36:57,011 --> 03:36:58,210
man.
That's a good thing.

4891
03:36:59,790 --> 03:37:04,210
Radioactive catfish.
Um,

4892
03:37:04,420 --> 03:37:06,370
we've been doing like three and a half 
hours.

4893
03:37:06,780 --> 03:37:08,620
Yeah.
It's already 5:15

4894
03:37:09,070 --> 03:37:12,040
mg per it.
Can they direct people to the replay?

4895
03:37:12,330 --> 03:37:13,350
Definitely.
Definitely.

4896
03:37:14,320 --> 03:37:17,530
The female flyweights was last night on 
UFC fight pass.

4897
03:37:17,531 --> 03:37:20,890
You can catch the replay anytime.
You could watch all Ebi.

4898
03:37:20,980 --> 03:37:23,260
Ebi,
one through 12.

4899
03:37:23,261 --> 03:37:25,900
They're all up there.
We had our first all girl show,

4900
03:37:26,230 --> 03:37:29,830
including an all girl combat Jujitsu 
tournament.

4901
03:37:29,831 --> 03:37:34,831
We had a regular 16 girl tournament it 
totally with the people that were 

4902
03:37:35,921 --> 03:37:38,620
predicted to win it.
They didn't even get close.

4903
03:37:38,770 --> 03:37:39,850
It was,
it was,

4904
03:37:40,030 --> 03:37:42,040
it was A.
I don't want to give it away.

4905
03:37:42,130 --> 03:37:44,140
Don't say anything but a boiler.
Yeah.

4906
03:37:44,150 --> 03:37:47,530
And we had a four woman combat Jujitsu 
tournaments.

4907
03:37:48,250 --> 03:37:53,250
Have you seen that?
Have crazy Jujitsu with palm strikes to 

4908
03:37:53,250 --> 03:37:56,470
the face and head and body or legal.
When you're on the ground standing,

4909
03:37:56,471 --> 03:37:58,660
it's just wrestling,
but on the ground,

4910
03:37:58,661 --> 03:38:03,661
as soon as someone hits the ground,
you could start palm striking to the 

4911
03:38:03,661 --> 03:38:03,661
face.
Beautiful to the body.

4912
03:38:03,661 --> 03:38:03,690
So,
um,

4913
03:38:03,940 --> 03:38:04,270
we had,
uh,

4914
03:38:04,271 --> 03:38:07,420
for woman tournament it was nuts.
It was nuts.

4915
03:38:07,520 --> 03:38:12,520
Okay.
And then September ninth we're going to 

4916
03:38:12,520 --> 03:38:12,520
be back.
That's going to be the next fight.

4917
03:38:12,520 --> 03:38:12,890
Companion.
I'm not doing that.

4918
03:38:12,891 --> 03:38:14,520
UFC,
that's UFC 2:15

4919
03:38:15,530 --> 03:38:20,530
in Edmonton.
So we'll be doing a fight companion 

4920
03:38:20,530 --> 03:38:22,370
pumped this week.
Sacramento,

4921
03:38:22,371 --> 03:38:25,490
Thursday night,
Seattle,

4922
03:38:25,491 --> 03:38:28,340
Friday night.
And then San Diego Saturday night.

4923
03:38:28,370 --> 03:38:33,370
There's tickets,
tickets available for the second shows 

4924
03:38:33,370 --> 03:38:35,240
and all three of those places.
Otherwise this whole program and we will

4925
03:38:35,630 --> 03:38:36,290
see you soon.

4926
03:38:36,340 --> 03:38:37,150
Okay,
bye.

4927
03:38:37,210 --> 03:38:37,720
Bye.

4928
03:38:47,600 --> 03:38:48,700
Mm.
