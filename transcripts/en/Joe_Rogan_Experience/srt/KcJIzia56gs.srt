00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,570
If we go back to 10,000,

3
00:00:05,571 --> 00:00:06,710
12,000 years ago,

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:11,660
clearly whatever happened then must've
been profoundly traumatic to the

5
00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:12,500
survivors.

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:13,611
Think about this.

7
00:00:13,611 --> 00:00:18,611
If you were the survivor of an event
that basically erased modern civilization

8
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,810
and you are living in a small isolated
band of survivors with no way to

9
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:27,560
communicate with the rest of the world
and no knowledge of whether there was

10
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,870
even other survivors
anywhere on the earth.

11
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,300
It could profoundly affect your,

12
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:32,541
your,

13
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:32,751
your,

14
00:00:32,751 --> 00:00:37,751
your consciousness and and that could
be so profound that it's the imprint of

15
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:41,570
those events can be so profound
and it could be passed on

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,640
for generations and and be
lodged in our subconscious.

17
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:51,350
This idea of human conflict necessary
for human survival and the traumas that

18
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:54,290
had been visited upon our
species by nature itself.

19
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,030
So I think that once we come to terms
with the possibly origins of only until we

20
00:01:02,211 --> 00:01:04,580
come to terms with the
origin of human conflict,

21
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,940
are we going to be able to
purge it once and for all?

22
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:08,600
And,

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,600
and realize that that the modern analog
for that scenario was that coming out of

24
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:17,420
that catastrophe.

25
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,220
Abundant resources,

26
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,301
abundance,

27
00:01:20,301 --> 00:01:21,050
habitat,

28
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,070
abundant space,

29
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:27,020
no conflict for territory or resources
because the human population was limited.

30
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:32,180
What I suggest is that if people want
to understand the viable future of the

31
00:01:32,181 --> 00:01:33,140
human species,

32
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:38,030
go out on a crystal clear
night and look at the sky.

33
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,920
There is the future.

34
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,790
There's our potential future because the
scenario is that had been around since

35
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:48,650
the 1970 show that everything that
we're extracting now from the earth,

36
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:49,910
the minerals,

37
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,470
the precious metals,

38
00:01:51,471 --> 00:01:52,490
the hydrocarbons,

39
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,830
it's all out there in infinite abundance
and it's basically just outside of our

40
00:01:57,831 --> 00:01:58,664
doorstep.

41
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,850
And we are as close now to being able
to harvest the resources of the cosmic

42
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:08,740
environment as we were from
setting foot on the moon in 1960.

43
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:09,040
No,

44
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,701
nick and nate,

45
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:12,310
they get a painted to be
these bad guys and you know,

46
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,550
that's part of the
persona that they promote,

47
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,820
that that's all well and good.

48
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:17,260
But like they're very,

49
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:17,971
very respectable.

50
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:18,251
But you know,

51
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:18,491
when he,

52
00:02:18,491 --> 00:02:19,324
um,

53
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,730
when Nick beat Frank Shamrock,

54
00:02:21,731 --> 00:02:24,850
he was on the ground after the fight and
nick reached down and picked him up and

55
00:02:24,851 --> 00:02:25,190
said,

56
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,480
you know,

57
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,081
you're a legend.

58
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:26,831
You can't be on the floor,

59
00:02:26,831 --> 00:02:27,670
stand up or whatever.

60
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,390
Yeah,

61
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,223
and this is,

62
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,980
but all the people see is they go for
the stare down at the press conference.

63
00:02:32,981 --> 00:02:33,430
Netflix,

64
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,140
I'm off and frank
shamrock grabs his balls,

65
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:37,570
but they're both very
respectful fighters in the,

66
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,100
you know,

67
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,730
I think they get,

68
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,900
they get a bad rap sometimes.

69
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,351
Well,

70
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:45,100
he definitely gets crazy before
the fight and anxious and.

71
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:48,070
But that's to be expected
and the shit talking.

72
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,220
Look sunsuit set it and the art of war,

73
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:51,710
you know,

74
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,690
a multi Musashi talked about it
in the book of five rings did.

75
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,460
There's all sorts of things that go
on in the fight and in contest there's

76
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,600
advantages to be had and there's a
mental advantages that if you do not take

77
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,120
advantage of those mental
advantages and your opponent does,

78
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:08,260
you're at a disadvantage.

79
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,610
And when nick immediately
starts the fight and he's like,

80
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,340
he's got his hands out to Anderson,

81
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,200
like what Bitch,

82
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:14,801
what pitch?

83
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:15,790
And he's walking towards him.

84
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,181
Come on,

85
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:16,901
what the fuck you going to do?

86
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:17,111
Come on,

87
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:17,770
what are you going to do?

88
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,700
And you see him talking,

89
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:21,370
like constantly talking
and you just see Anderson,

90
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:24,500
like people get flustered
when nick does that mean,

91
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,400
so it does it in sparring
to tell the really high.

92
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,090
That's the first time I met Nicole
was brought in for actually the,

93
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:31,900
uh,

94
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,500
for uh,

95
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,880
nate's fight with aunts Rooney.

96
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,960
And when I got to the gym,

97
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,653
uh,

98
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,310
nate had hurt his neck or
something was going to the,

99
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,020
had to go to the
chiropractor or something.

100
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,381
And they were like,

101
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:42,260
I'll just wait nickleby,

102
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,240
here you can spar with nick.

103
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:43,541
And I was like,

104
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,320
okay.

105
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,690
So like nick shows up and
I'm a big fan of these guys,

106
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:46,901
you know,

107
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:48,640
like as I was Kinda like,

108
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:48,940
you know,

109
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,270
a little star struck and uh,

110
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,030
nick shows up and he's just

111
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,513
like

112
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,460
totally coast department.

113
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:56,741
I was like,

114
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:58,790
so what are we going?

115
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,833
Are we going to fight her tonight?

116
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,380
He's like unified right now,

117
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,130
you know,

118
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:03,371
and it.

119
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:04,240
But it was just like,

120
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,730
just like he walks into the cage,

121
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:06,960
you know,

122
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,010
kind of like just look at me
up and down kind of thing.

123
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:09,281
And then,

124
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:09,461
you know,

125
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:09,730
we,

126
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:10,301
we started,

127
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:11,740
it was really hard and we
had like a really good,

128
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:16,170
a really hard session and then
after that he was like kickboxing,

129
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:16,600
Huh?

130
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,200
So if you want to hang out after,

131
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:18,410
you know,

132
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,420
we started hanging out after that,

133
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:20,680
but it was,

134
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:20,980
uh,

135
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,190
it was very much like a like is,

136
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:23,780
you know,

137
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,080
that's,

138
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,060
that's who he is,

139
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:25,894
you know,

140
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,910
just like I grew up in Libya,

141
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,930
Saudi Arabia,

142
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:30,711
Pakistan,

143
00:04:30,711 --> 00:04:32,600
I didn't come to North
America until I was 24.

144
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,170
I grew up in pretty much Muslim majority
countries and some very conservative

145
00:04:36,171 --> 00:04:37,430
ones all the time.

146
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,100
And you know,

147
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,010
I just,

148
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:43,160
whenever I hear people say that this
has nothing to do with religion,

149
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,440
it just doesn't make any sense to me.

150
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,970
Is that like an American
liberal convenient thing
to say because it makes you

151
00:04:49,971 --> 00:04:53,160
look super sensitive and
very noam Chomsky ask?

152
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,140
Well yeah it does.

153
00:04:54,141 --> 00:04:55,950
And then there's a um,

154
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,660
I don't know what goes into it.

155
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,390
I know that there's a
lot of fear and you know,

156
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,590
people don't want to criticize this,

157
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,130
um,

158
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,380
you know,

159
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,740
we saw what happened with someone or
I stayed all the way up to the Paris

160
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:07,574
attacks.

161
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,180
So there is a fear of that and there's
also a fear of being seen as a bigot.

162
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,603
That was Brian.

163
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,600
I call it Islamophobia Phobia.

164
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,503
People are like,

165
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,950
great word and you know,

166
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:19,940
I'm a phobia phobia.

167
00:05:19,941 --> 00:05:20,774
I love it.

168
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,590
It's something that a lot of people
relate to immediately trigger it.

169
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,610
It is.

170
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,630
I hate that term.

171
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,560
Islamophobia.

172
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,430
And look,

173
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,810
what about Christian have phobia.

174
00:05:29,811 --> 00:05:33,800
What's hilarious to me is that a
lot of quote unquote progressive,

175
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:37,040
very left wing people will
openly mock Christianity.

176
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,460
Yeah.

177
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:42,460
While defending Islam or by labeling
people Islamophobic who conservative.

178
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:43,460
Yeah.

179
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:43,720
That,

180
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,010
I mean,

181
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,530
you gotta you gotta stay consistent.

182
00:05:45,531 --> 00:05:46,820
If you're a true liberal,

183
00:05:46,821 --> 00:05:48,520
and I know everybody's saying this,

184
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,371
well unfortunately,

185
00:05:49,371 --> 00:05:50,470
not everybody's saying it.

186
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,650
I wish more people were saying it,

187
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:52,430
but you know,

188
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,263
if you are,

189
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,781
for instance,

190
00:05:53,781 --> 00:05:55,760
opposed to killing gay people,

191
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,100
you should be opposed
killing baby gay people.

192
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:03,101
Whether it's in the KKK manifesto
or the Bible or the Koran,

193
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,790
or in the Republican Party,

194
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:05,210
you know,

195
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,050
or in Uganda,

196
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,240
it doesn't matter what it is,

197
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:10,820
if you're opposed to something you
should be opposed to it across the board.

198
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,670
It doesn't suddenly
become respectful that,

199
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:13,911
okay,

200
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:14,300
now,

201
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,021
well it's in the Bible,

202
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:15,920
so we got to respect that.

203
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:21,200
Know and it's respect for ideas
is just such an overrated.

204
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,810
It's considered a virtue,

205
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:23,961
you know,

206
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:27,840
respecting people's ideas and beliefs
and ideas are not people you know,

207
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:28,620
like that's,

208
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,270
and I was trying to,

209
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:34,100
that's the problem with the
word Islamophobia is that
it implies criticism of an

210
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:37,670
idea and there is genuine
anti Muslim bigotry.

211
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,040
People do commit hate
crimes against Muslims,

212
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,860
but Muslims are people.

213
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,580
They,

214
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,310
they're not.

215
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,860
I mean they're entitled to respect,

216
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:46,640
they have rights.

217
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,280
Islam itself is not a person.

218
00:06:48,281 --> 00:06:48,930
It's just a,

219
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:49,701
it's a book.

220
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:50,690
It's an ideology.

221
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,470
It's an ideology,

222
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,580
a bunch of ideas in a book.

223
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,370
So it doesn't have rights and
it's not entitled to respect.

224
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:55,681
I,

225
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:56,011
you know,

226
00:06:56,011 --> 00:06:56,460
I,

227
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,460
I didn't get to meet dangerfield
and I Miss Carlin and I was like,

228
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,080
I just want to work with wrinkles at some
point and then it came up that I could

229
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,320
work with them at in Montreal and I
was supposed to go on vacation with my

230
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:12,540
family and I literally
sent my wife and kids.

231
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,261
I'm like,

232
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:13,741
I'm going to meet it.

233
00:07:13,741 --> 00:07:16,320
I'm going to be three days
late to our family vacation.

234
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,820
I'm going to go work with wrinkles.

235
00:07:17,821 --> 00:07:18,670
I had to is like,

236
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,230
this is.

237
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:19,650
Yeah.

238
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:20,490
As a comic,

239
00:07:20,491 --> 00:07:21,540
that's an opportunity.

240
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,360
It's really hard to
pass my whole objective.

241
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,850
Those two days was I just
want to be shit on by him.

242
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,380
I was just lobbing
stuff and I'm like done.

243
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:32,131
So,

244
00:07:32,131 --> 00:07:32,920
uh,

245
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,560
but we're working together two nights,

246
00:07:34,561 --> 00:07:35,310
so like,

247
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:35,641
you know,

248
00:07:35,641 --> 00:07:37,020
after that we're going to
know each other pretty well.

249
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,950
You think when you get back to la,

250
00:07:37,951 --> 00:07:38,784
we're going to hang out.

251
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,293
Don't push it.

252
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,790
Then I'm like waiting for
them with just totally that.

253
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:44,624
I like time.

254
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,030
Are you gonna?

255
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,850
Watch my act tonight.

256
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,730
I really appreciate it.

257
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:48,564
If you watch my act,

258
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:54,020
I had my little busy and then after the
show I go back to his dressing room.

259
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,120
What the cool thing was.

260
00:07:57,121 --> 00:07:57,691
You would love it.

261
00:07:57,691 --> 00:07:58,524
He just,

262
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,740
it's like old school show business
just walked into the building.

263
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,431
It's like,

264
00:08:02,431 --> 00:08:02,641
you know,

265
00:08:02,641 --> 00:08:06,390
even in Montreal it was kind of thing
is everyone's doing shows all week when

266
00:08:06,391 --> 00:08:08,460
hit when it was his time for the show,

267
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,740
guys in Tuxedos or walking around.

268
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,100
Security guys are hanging out
old school guys with like,

269
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,880
you know,

270
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,700
gel in their hair and like
show business is happening.

271
00:08:17,701 --> 00:08:18,031
This is,

272
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,250
the halls are cleared and it's like,

273
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,690
this is just music,

274
00:08:21,691 --> 00:08:22,980
classic music playing.

275
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:23,431
And it's like,

276
00:08:23,431 --> 00:08:23,581
no,

277
00:08:23,581 --> 00:08:24,414
we're doing a show.

278
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,010
Not Walking in and just tighten up on it.

279
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,271
No,

280
00:08:27,271 --> 00:08:28,350
this is a show.

281
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,813
So great.

282
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,860
So at the end I go to his dressing room.

283
00:08:31,861 --> 00:08:33,060
He's in his dressing room in a,

284
00:08:33,061 --> 00:08:34,200
in a silver,

285
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,460
like silk robe.

286
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,080
These little slippers.

287
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,013
Slippers,

288
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:40,660
slippers.

289
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:40,940
Oh,

290
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,210
gold stuff on the toes.

291
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,670
And he's got all the makings for Martinis.

292
00:08:44,671 --> 00:08:45,210
Got The ice,

293
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,510
got the olives.

294
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,281
It's got the glass,

295
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:47,850
the shake,

296
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,500
but just shoves it on his glass.

297
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,670
He just puts it all.

298
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:51,331
It doesn't even shake.

299
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:51,991
It just puts ice,

300
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:52,850
olives and vodka.

301
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,160
You sitting there drinking
it and I go to see him.

302
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,390
He's like,

303
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,080
Tom,

304
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,590
come here.

305
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,740
He holds my holds.

306
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,780
My hand doesn't let go of my hand.

307
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:01,680
It's just the greatest.

308
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:02,551
He's like,

309
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:03,300
Tom,

310
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,290
I watched your show tonight.

311
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,580
I watched the whole thing.

312
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,140
Oh,

313
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,451
thank you,

314
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:06,691
Don.

315
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:07,524
Thank you.

316
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,230
Have you considered a
career in grocery delivery?

317
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,090
You go around and deliver food
and you make people happy.

318
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,320
Throw in a joke once in a while to
keep yourself in killing yourself

319
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,270
like this is better
than the whole vacation.

320
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:24,450
I'm about to go on with
my family so much better.

321
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:24,721
That.

322
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:25,650
Did you put pictures?

323
00:09:25,651 --> 00:09:26,481
Did you take pictures of it?

324
00:09:26,481 --> 00:09:27,630
I got a couple shots.

325
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,390
That's huge.

326
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,580
I was just the best.
