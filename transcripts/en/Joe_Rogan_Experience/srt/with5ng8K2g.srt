1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,050
The general good experience.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,120
I'm here with Peter Joseph,

3
00:00:08,121 --> 00:00:09,350
future king of the world,

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,960
future core leader for
the zeitgeists movement.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,980
You're uncomfortable with that,

6
00:00:12,981 --> 00:00:13,814
right?

7
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,243
Growing up to

8
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:17,140
listen.

9
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,930
You can accept that kings or wells
for just you on the front of the ship,

10
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:25,340
just like they didn't have to Capria
king in the world playing right there was

11
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:26,240
an awesome conversation,

12
00:00:26,241 --> 00:00:26,511
man.

13
00:00:26,511 --> 00:00:27,080
It's really,

14
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,520
you're an interesting dude and you've
had a very strange sort of jumped into

15
00:00:31,521 --> 00:00:32,354
this thing.

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,620
It's been a ride and you're very
young guy to be doing this too.

17
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:37,700
You're only 32 years old.

18
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:38,961
That's amazing.

19
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:40,520
I would've thought you
were much older than that.

20
00:00:40,521 --> 00:00:44,090
Just really young looking like
if that a lot telling you,

21
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:46,400
man of the CIA is going to
probably come to you soon.

22
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,020
They're going to try to either make
you more of their own or kill you.

23
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,180
They can put me out of my misery.

24
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,530
You're gonna have to make a decision,

25
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,270
make a decision or use your powers of
charisma to convince them to let you run

26
00:00:56,271 --> 00:00:56,900
shit.

27
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,140
That's what I would suggest work
that ag a little sigh off on the CIA.

28
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:00,561
What do you think,

29
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,070
Brian?

30
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:01,770
I think he can do it.

31
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,603
I think I could do it.

32
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,390
It was just the most fucked
damn podcast we've ever done.

33
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:05,600
I bet.

34
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,530
How many chances have you done the
podcast is in this setting of zero.

35
00:01:09,531 --> 00:01:10,400
This is the first pocket.

36
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,800
I do lots of little radio shows
that you could call podcasts,

37
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,653
but nothing like this.

38
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:16,933
So

39
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,823
out of the ordinary.

40
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,660
It was so scary as well.

41
00:01:20,661 --> 00:01:21,620
That is true too,

42
00:01:21,621 --> 00:01:21,901
right?

43
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:25,340
Like there's no goddamn humor to
be a 32 year old dude out there,

44
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:25,881
you know,

45
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:28,310
doom and gloom and doom to civilization.

46
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,173
Trying to be positive,

47
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:29,691
positive.

48
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:30,680
It's not all doom and gloom,

49
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,090
but I appreciate the flexibility
of different angles going on.

50
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:34,731
It's fun,

51
00:01:34,731 --> 00:01:34,971
right?

52
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:36,170
You can actually be yourself,

53
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:36,690
you know,

54
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,190
and I,

55
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,460
I appreciate the way that you accepted
that and it didn't take yourself too

56
00:01:40,461 --> 00:01:40,801
serious.

57
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,860
That just jumped in and went with it.

58
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,420
So people need to find you.

59
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:49,630
They can go to the zeitgeists
movement.com and a Tz m moot movement,

60
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,620
Tz movement and the Twitter
and the films were at the site.

61
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:58,850
Guys can movie.com don't go to watch like
guys moving.com cause that's like some

62
00:01:58,851 --> 00:01:59,571
scam side.

63
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:01,050
It's going to put a fellowship of Shit.

64
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:01,880
Shit,

65
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,713
I fucked up.

66
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,531
Bleep that out.

67
00:02:03,531 --> 00:02:04,364
Right.

68
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,450
I thank you for you to
Joseph to Care Prof.

69
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,303
Ours fear.

70
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:10,970
I had nothing.

71
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:11,803
I don't know what's up.

72
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,880
What time is shrimp fest this year?

73
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:14,810
Is it going to be June again?

74
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:15,711
Late June,

75
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:16,311
early July.

76
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:17,450
He got to wait till the
kids are at a school.

77
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,853
That's important.

78
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:20,871
Yeah.

79
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:21,561
You don't want kids.

80
00:02:21,561 --> 00:02:22,161
Truman on there.

81
00:02:22,161 --> 00:02:23,090
My finals week.

82
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,980
How do you know who's done everywhere?

83
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,510
Research.

84
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,170
Yeah.

85
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,100
What did you do it last time?

86
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:28,601
It was June though.

87
00:02:28,601 --> 00:02:28,870
No,

88
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,410
22 20th schools got out like the public
schools got out before that a couple

89
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,580
weeks before that so
it was going to be mad.

90
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:35,961
People are like,

91
00:02:35,961 --> 00:02:36,741
I'm out of school yet.

92
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:37,610
I was like that's a great point.

93
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,301
That's a great point.

94
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:38,451
Yeah.

95
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:41,450
He got a contract and final TD
do three days of shooting fast.

96
00:02:41,451 --> 00:02:41,970
That's what he did.

97
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:42,591
He was a weekend.

98
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:44,480
It was Sunday or Saturday.

99
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:44,661
Sunday.

100
00:02:44,661 --> 00:02:44,961
Monday.

101
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:47,000
You can do them at any
time during the weekend.

102
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,320
And then I go to one day
but I like three days off.

103
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:50,851
Two or three days.

104
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:54,790
Cause sometimes people can't do it
but they want to be able to catch on.

105
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,370
Oh yeah.

106
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,230
Just calling something Earth Day.

107
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,520
It makes people conscious.

108
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,040
Hell they have

109
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,851
not littering and,

110
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:03,860
and you know it's doing on Christmas,

111
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,240
Christmas,

112
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,150
that's got to be warm enough
to go around and shit.

113
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:08,470
People have families and stuff.

114
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:10,810
It's hard keeping away from
mushrooms on Christmas though.

115
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,410
You can't,

116
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,710
you're more than what happens if
you follow the whole Christmas.

117
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:15,910
Santa Claus is a mushroom thing.

118
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:16,871
People are like,

119
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:18,780
I want to make another thing.

120
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,070
When you look at all the
different correlations,

121
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:22,030
like when you looked online,

122
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,190
there's stuff I want to say.

123
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:24,881
How old was those?

124
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:25,180
Um,

125
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,013
those paintings are,

126
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:26,531
yeah,

127
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:27,364
I want to say to,

128
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,570
some of them were not old.

129
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,920
Some of them obviously are new,

130
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,950
but there's a bunch of really old ones
that were looking or where it comes from.

131
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:33,251
Yeah.

132
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:34,150
Like something to do with that.

133
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,021
With the Pagan holiday.

134
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:35,801
They took over like a,

135
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:39,850
but they were that where the worship that
probably had something to do with it,

136
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,600
but it was also something to do
with just the Siberian Shamans,

137
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:43,960
you know,

138
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,581
the whole idea was,

139
00:03:44,581 --> 00:03:47,920
and then he comes from the North
Pole pole while Siberia is like,

140
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:48,630
you know,

141
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,930
near the North Pole and the Siberian
shamans are the ones where they know known

142
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:54,850
to use this Aminay to
miscarry and mushroom.

143
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,180
That's what we were talking
about with the reindeer too.

144
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,550
I forgot to say that when people
come out of their huts to pee,

145
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,570
when they're having these mushrooms,

146
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:04,540
timelines reindeers we'll knock
them over to get their pis.

147
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,960
They'll knock them over to get smaller
disagrees with that being a theory

148
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,420
because he said in Siberia there's no,

149
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,320
they don't have that,

150
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,210
um,

151
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,930
that the um,

152
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:14,681
images and stuff,

153
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:16,030
they don't have that
of the flying reindeer.

154
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,830
So it was all based on that.

155
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,053
They should have it too.

156
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,400
It makes sense maybe.

157
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:22,330
But you know,

158
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:23,164
maybe

159
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,190
maybe to that which is
also possible that to them,

160
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:30,430
the idea of the intoxicated,

161
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,590
like it didn't need to
have the reindeer fly.

162
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,130
Everybody kind of knew the
reindeer were tripping balls off.

163
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:36,611
Who knows?

164
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:36,771
You know,

165
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:40,300
and then maybe people heard about it at
the reindeer do eat these psychedelic

166
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:41,710
mushrooms that is a part of their diet.

167
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,740
They actually liked them was pretty wild.

168
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:46,820
Right out.

169
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,010
We know some psych of dogs kill
animals like DMT kill sheep.

170
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:51,730
Really?

171
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,001
Yeah.

172
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:56,870
If they find the graph that's
rich in certain DMT die,

173
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,920
the,

174
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,970
the sheep will eat it and then fall on
their back and their little legs kick up

175
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:02,560
in the air and they
fucking seizure to death.

176
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,390
Which is pretty good because
the paintings from first.

177
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,933
Yeah.

178
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:07,511
I wonder.

179
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:07,930
Yeah,

180
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,651
cows don't ever,

181
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:12,670
each rooms they have a good relationship
with dogs eating shrooms the other day.

182
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,513
I don't know.

183
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,020
You better be careful man.

184
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,760
Poisonous mushrooms on
the back of my yard.

185
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:19,950
All these white mushrooms grow.

186
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,200
There's some fucking seriously
poisonous mushrooms man.

187
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,990
And there's some that looked
like suck it delicate ones.

188
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,093
Yeah.

189
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,670
Dogs can eat.

190
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,971
I don't,

191
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:28,390
shit,

192
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,470
I wouldn't worry about the dog.

193
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,690
I had to worry about you or something
like big mushroom like shit that's not

194
00:05:34,691 --> 00:05:38,590
poisonous and I just throw it over the
fence like they already had enough.

195
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,520
If it is your dad do.

196
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:40,354
The friend of mine,

197
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,550
a friend of mine got
the most ridiculous dog.

198
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,590
It's a baby shit too.

199
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,750
And all my God,

200
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,850
it's so little man.

201
00:05:48,851 --> 00:05:50,890
It's like this big red day.

202
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,590
No it's a baby cause shit's
who's only grow like that day.

203
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,040
But this is like a little tiny
baby one and like holy Shit.

204
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,430
So cute.

205
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,111
Oh,

206
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:02,990
Cabo is a should say to
this thing is so cute.

207
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:04,040
It's ridiculous.

208
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:04,341
It's a,

209
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:05,210
it's you.

210
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:06,020
You can't,

211
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,160
you can't believe it's real.

212
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:07,970
It looks like a little,

213
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,320
the whole that's moving around,

214
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:10,040
you know?

215
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,873
Yeah.

216
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,323
They used to be a wolf.

217
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,243
How crazy is that?

218
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,700
What the shits it.

219
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,840
Oh and genetically somewhere about your
job and the way we're doing it to a,

220
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,250
it's the way of breeding out.

221
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,870
It's pretty much what
the Holocaust was like.

222
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,280
Part of that was like a
scrubber to the negative traits.

223
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,700
They won't be part of our site anymore.

224
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:29,751
They were doing it.

225
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:33,410
The people that just go all over and they
said the reason the crime went in New

226
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:33,590
York went,

227
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,423
plummeted,

228
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,240
um,

229
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,710
recently at the hardest
cause of education,

230
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:37,131
stuff like that.

231
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:37,964
It's like no,

232
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,310
it's because abortion was
legalized 18 years ago.

233
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,960
That's the only thing.

234
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:44,690
It can be traced to all the poor people.

235
00:06:44,691 --> 00:06:48,020
Instead of having these kids
and like making new criminals,

236
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,560
they got rid of them so it plummeted 18
years later when they would have been

237
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:52,610
started being tried as adults.

238
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,080
Oh my God.

239
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,050
That's amazing.

240
00:06:55,051 --> 00:06:55,550
Yeah,

241
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,111
and they were doing it.

242
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:59,210
It gets people's wills and like North
Carolina that are people sterilizing

243
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,650
though like the super white trash.

244
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:01,750
Gotcha.

245
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,480
This will be like you're,

246
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,850
you don't need anymore to
just like some amazing,

247
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,720
yeah.

248
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,650
That's amazing.

249
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:08,630
Wow.

250
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,390
Yeah.

251
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,260
They want to make now it's because
of the education programs like Nope,

252
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,300
you can't trace it back to anything else,

253
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:15,010
but that,

254
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:15,480
that's,

255
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,880
and nobody wants to talk about it.

256
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,200
Where did you get this from?

257
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,330
Is all of my friend Kurt
Metzger turned me on to it,

258
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,660
but it's all out there
and all over the Internet.

259
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,141
Cool.

260
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:24,540
Why?

261
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,400
I'll have to read that.

262
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:25,970
That's,

263
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,200
if that is a true statistic.

264
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:28,130
That's fascinating.

265
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,473
That's amazing.

266
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,000
I wish I knew what the years
where it's like the year,

267
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:32,370
uh,

268
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,280
abortion was legalized
and then 18 years later,

269
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,160
that's so crazy.

270
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,990
Who would have ever thought

271
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,990
and it's like allow fucking,

272
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,310
yeah.

273
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,250
Immigrants or whatever it is or they're
fucking criminals allowed them to get

274
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:47,084
rid of babies.

275
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,890
Jesus Christ.

276
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,940
I don't want to think like this.

277
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:51,290
Are you really?

278
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,540
It's just like dogs.

279
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,473
That's

280
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,600
freaking me out here buddy.

281
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,340
It is kind of like dog breeding.

282
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,233
Yeah.

283
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,160
They don't know how the fuck
they ever did that either,

284
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:01,670
by the way.

285
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,130
They don't,

286
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,990
they only guessing how the fuck
they made all these different dogs.

287
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,610
No one has the direct records,

288
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,300
you know?

289
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,130
No one knows how the fuck
they were mad at shit too.

290
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,590
And I made all wolf and
turn it into a Shitzu.

291
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,281
You can,

292
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:15,170
you could give me paperwork all you want.

293
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:15,621
You know,

294
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,050
no one really knows how to fuck.

295
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,780
But he did that.

296
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,920
That's silly shit.

297
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,003
The fuck.

298
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,610
How did they make bulldogs?

299
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,453
Dobermans?

300
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,770
It's all from wolves.

301
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,230
Who,

302
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:25,520
yeah.

303
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,930
How many generations did that tag?

304
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,330
How the fuck did they
exactly go about doing that?

305
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,920
I think do that from wold,

306
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:32,450
but I'd have to be over
like a billion years.

307
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,463
I don't know man.

308
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,640
Who the fuck knows they,

309
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:34,941
you know,

310
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:37,700
they had said that it was a really
recent discovery that it was a,

311
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,630
it was all wolves.

312
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,340
They used to think that it was a bunch of,

313
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:40,551
that.

314
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:43,340
Most dogs are a bunch of
different wild candidates,

315
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:43,911
you know,

316
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:44,860
I think that's the word for it.

317
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,430
Kane needs Caney just broke off.

318
00:08:46,431 --> 00:08:49,160
And so they thought there was a
bunch of different wild kind of dogs,

319
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:49,371
you know,

320
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:50,480
like jackals or whatever.

321
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:51,410
And they're all mixed together.

322
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:52,520
But now it's all wolf.

323
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:53,810
Man could happen fast.

324
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,260
Yeah,

325
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,890
knows.

326
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,610
But it's from,

327
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,050
it happened because the people,

328
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,750
it's really nuts because
the only thing that,

329
00:08:59,751 --> 00:09:00,720
it's like people,

330
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,633
his dogs,

331
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,091
dogs,

332
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:07,170
the only thing that's like people where
we're totally not uniform as a species,

333
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,640
but that we can interbreed
with each other.

334
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:08,830
Oh,

335
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,910
you can in a breed with ones that
don't look at anything like that.

336
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,040
Salmon can't breathe with a bass.

337
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,870
They swim in the same water,

338
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:17,100
but they can't fuck each other.

339
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,920
Shouldn't be able to breed with the Smith.

340
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,380
What does a Kaplan should have
gone with something like green.

341
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,653
Yeah.

342
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,520
Yeah.

343
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,450
That's fascinating.

344
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:26,761
Shit,

345
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:27,490
isn't it?

346
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,110
You know,

347
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:28,651
people are,

348
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,450
we vary as much as dogs do.

349
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:30,811
I mean,

350
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:31,980
you have like many mean,

351
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:33,060
then you have Shaquille O'neil,

352
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,170
you know you'd have,

353
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,790
they both could get someone pregnant.

354
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:41,090
You know [inaudible] you've got little
tiny dudes fight 135 pounds and then

355
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:45,650
you've got dudes like Brock Lesnar who
has to cut weight to make to 65 that's

356
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,470
like a different breed.

357
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,621
Yeah.

358
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:48,330
It's like this weird like dogs.

359
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,760
We're like dogs in our,

360
00:09:49,761 --> 00:09:50,594
our,

361
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,990
you know how much we vary.

362
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,620
I think this is the reason if you get
like when this race and race traits,

363
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,693
hmm.

364
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,180
Yeah.

365
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,000
Because they keep integrating
the same way over and over again.

366
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,540
What's fascinating that
people still to this day,

367
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,170
it's so clear that people who developed
and certain parts of the world,

368
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,340
it just looked different.

369
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,750
They have different attributes,

370
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:11,970
they have different strengths
and different weaknesses,

371
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:12,601
you know,

372
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:15,390
and you know there's certain
parts of the world where there's,

373
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:15,840
this is,

374
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,950
here's where the agents come from.

375
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,641
They come from Asia.

376
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:17,881
Look,

377
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:19,140
they all look the same
the other way around.

378
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,650
Boom.

379
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,760
This is where the Africans come from.

380
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:23,710
Look through the ones that live in
Africa was coming near the creditor.

381
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,520
Yeah,

382
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,353
right.

383
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,333
You know,

384
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,370
and the,

385
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,750
that's the argument also that
human beings are some sort of a,

386
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,470
an experiment from aliens
is that we're just like,

387
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,040
like people manipulated dogs created,

388
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,610
they started us off that
they manipulated the DNA.

389
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,120
Yeah.

390
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,160
Just like we manipulated
the DNA of the dogs.

391
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:44,990
What do you think about that?

392
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,800
True.

393
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,730
Otherwise and not smash and
breeding off for pleasure.

394
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,540
Yes.

395
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,800
That's the end of this video.

396
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,820
Thank you very much.

00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,170
thanks for coming on man.

409
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,820
Man That was a lot of fun.

410
00:11:03,821 --> 00:11:05,440
I'm a convert to your program.

411
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,120
Are you beautiful?

412
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,890
I'd like it even more if I wasn't on it.

413
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,780
I think you converted a lot of people.

414
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:14,290
I think he changed a lot of people's
opinions on hunting and trapping and I

415
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,420
think you expressed yourself in a way,

416
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,140
um,

417
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,490
in the podcast it's like,

418
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:18,911
you know,

419
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:23,050
we were talking about where it's such
a long form you get to really express

420
00:11:23,051 --> 00:11:23,590
yourself.

421
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:28,590
You could kind of tell like sometimes
like you had some really well thought out

422
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,320
answers to these questions almost like
he had been waiting for people to ask

423
00:11:32,321 --> 00:11:35,350
them because this is like something
that's really kind of bugging you about

424
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:36,184
perceptions.

425
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,370
I think the same issues come
up again and again and I think,

426
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:39,881
you know,

427
00:11:39,881 --> 00:11:44,881
you put them to me in a way that was
actually more challenging to me because I

428
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:47,680
could tell you were like
coming to honest conclusions.

429
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,970
I mean you're asking like real questions
that came up and not questions that you

430
00:11:51,971 --> 00:11:52,880
learned somewhere.

431
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,350
I'm going to ask him that
because that was a good point.

432
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:56,791
Like you're,

433
00:11:56,791 --> 00:12:00,420
you're like giving me thoughts
that popped out in your mind.

434
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,670
It's a huge subject.

435
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,240
And I know that I wound up doing a lot
of like adding layers on things like

436
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,211
this.

437
00:12:08,211 --> 00:12:09,021
But then if you look,

438
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:12,370
there's also this and it makes
that not so this national,

439
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,300
but it's really hard
to come in and be like,

440
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:14,451
no,

441
00:12:14,451 --> 00:12:16,880
this is wrong and this is right and
it's wrong and this is right cause it's,

442
00:12:16,881 --> 00:12:20,240
things are so complicated the same way
that it's hard to come in and say that,

443
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:20,740
you know,

444
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,660
it's hard to come in and start
talking about euthanasia and accurate.

445
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:27,080
You have all these like definite
absolute opinions about the subject.

446
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,220
The wolf was really protect them.

447
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,180
There's so many different versions of,

448
00:12:32,181 --> 00:12:32,391
you know,

449
00:12:32,391 --> 00:12:32,590
like,

450
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,230
uh,

451
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,660
scare sites where people are
terrified of these wolves.

452
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:35,810
He's,

453
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:35,961
well,

454
00:12:35,961 --> 00:12:38,720
there's so much bigger and that's the
way you broke it down made so much sense.

455
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,180
Well they have the more smart food and
the food's not ready for them and they

456
00:12:41,181 --> 00:12:41,980
get bigger.

457
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,110
Was saying even after all of this,

458
00:12:45,111 --> 00:12:49,500
I still can't certify we speak
to that issue because I just,

459
00:12:49,501 --> 00:12:50,334
I don't know,

460
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,550
I guess coming from a lifelong,

461
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,520
a lifelong path as an outdoorsman,

462
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,420
she just not like an uneducated opinion,

463
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,270
not devoted a good permanent,

464
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,710
it's like trying to study
and understand these issues,

465
00:13:03,711 --> 00:13:05,810
but that is something I
frankly hadn't heard of,

466
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,673
but my guests,

467
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,680
I think that if you
follow what I'm saying,

468
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,220
that path would maybe lead you
do some enlightenment about that.

469
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,970
If you could live in a
part of this country,

470
00:13:14,971 --> 00:13:18,810
if you could like pick any spot in this
country where you would have like gray

471
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:22,320
hunting and great fishing and a good
place to like live off the land.

472
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,610
What part of the country would you peg?

473
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,313
I

474
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,750
did best,

475
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,793
um,

476
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,010
and,

477
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,350
and kind of enjoyed that aspect of
my life the most when I was living in

478
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,253
Montana.

479
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:34,840
Really?

480
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,390
Yeah.

481
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,223
Why Montana?

482
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,073
Well,

483
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:37,831
you know,

484
00:13:37,831 --> 00:13:40,470
it's like 77% public land.

485
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,180
You have very generous,

486
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,073
uh,

487
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,160
good long seasons.

488
00:13:44,161 --> 00:13:44,820
The haunt,

489
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,110
you have a wide variety.

490
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,510
You can haul almost all north
American big game there.

491
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:49,883
Um,

492
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:50,701
I liked it.

493
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:51,030
I said,

494
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,080
I still have family there.

495
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,910
I went there multiple times a year.

496
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:54,803
This is a great place.

497
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:55,763
Also.

498
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,850
Also Grizzlies.

499
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:57,760
Yeah,

500
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,250
but there's no season on mills,

501
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,570
but you can just shoot them
all year round or you know,

502
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,080
right now you cannot,

503
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,160
right now you cannot hunt.

504
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,080
There's still under protection.

505
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,040
If I see a Grizzly,

506
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:11,340
I'm shooting that you will wind
up being in tons of trouble.

507
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,450
Find stealthy.

508
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:12,751
I'm like,

509
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:13,020
man,

510
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,853
Joe,

511
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,620
they had guys check this out.

512
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,540
I'm fucking put landmines
around my property.

513
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,430
They've had guys,

514
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,560
you had guys that have killed,

515
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,040
they've had a black very permit,

516
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:29,350
so they're legally hunting blackbird
and accidentally kill a grizzly and you

517
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:33,790
wind up having your hunting privileges
revoked and in all states to cooperate in

518
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,560
this agreement for period seven years,

519
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:36,760
$10,000 fine.

520
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,431
Damn.

521
00:14:37,431 --> 00:14:38,170
Some big deal.

522
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:38,381
You don't,

523
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:38,651
you don't,

524
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:41,740
you don't mess the grizzly bears is
there some place they can hunt grizzlies,

525
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:42,574
right?

526
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,340
Where's that?

527
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:48,340
When we say the only state right now
where there's legal hunting of grizzly

528
00:14:49,251 --> 00:14:53,480
bears or brown bears
in and much of Canada,

529
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,160
are grizzly bears the same thing?

530
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:55,670
Yeah,

531
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,320
there are.

532
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,030
They're not recognized as
being subspecies anymore.

533
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,290
They recognized as being the same thing.

534
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,530
They used to call myself spaces.

535
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,490
They've been back and forth on
brown bear was like so sweet.

536
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,820
And Jeremy is the one no like and general
Noman like in general like Yo popular

537
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:11,240
terminology.

538
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,390
Popular Terminology would be that people
refer generally to the ones in the

539
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:17,150
interior as grizzlies cause they,

540
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:17,451
again,

541
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:18,920
there's like morphological differences.

542
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:21,290
The ones in the coastal
areas with access to salmon,

543
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:21,831
good,

544
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:22,610
much bigger.

545
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,660
They have a different appearance.

546
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,000
They generally refer to
those as brown bears.

547
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,970
Brown bears are actually
larger than the intercoastal.

548
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,000
The coastal bears get much bigger.

549
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,610
Had the potential of getting much
bigger in the bear is not interior.

550
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,070
The interior.

551
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:37,760
The Grizzlies.

552
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:37,911
Yeah.

553
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:39,850
So people usually call those grizzlies.

554
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,520
That's interesting.

555
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,690
Coastal one's brown bears,

556
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,430
but they're all part of the same species.

557
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,590
They're not recognized
as subspecies anymore.

558
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:48,990
It's same species versus herbalists I
think is what it totally embarrassed of

559
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,090
the really scary motherfuckers.

560
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,953
Right.

561
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:51,830
That's a whole different,

562
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,260
that's a whole different species.

563
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:58,460
But they now realize something they
hadn't realized before that there is some

564
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:03,461
genetic exchange between polar bears
and grizzlies and some people argue that

565
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:05,060
they can have viable offspring.

566
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:05,893
I don't know if that's true.

567
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,630
I don't know if that's
too common for hybrid.

568
00:16:07,631 --> 00:16:09,560
That's not uncommon by someone I think.

569
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,750
I don't know the answer to that,

570
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,650
but I know that there's,

571
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,740
there's a question about whether
they can have viable offspring.

572
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:16,500
However,

573
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,630
as a motherfucker and some people think
that what's driving that exchange is

574
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:23,750
that as we're losing ice polarized camps,

575
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,860
it's pushing more polar bear activity on
the mainland where they're running into

576
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:28,930
and hanging out in the grizzly bears.

577
00:16:28,931 --> 00:16:30,080
That's just something
that people throw off.

578
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,921
I don't know if that's true or not.

579
00:16:30,921 --> 00:16:32,390
Have you ever counted a
polar bear in the wild?

580
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,740
I've never laid eyes on a poor rental.

581
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:35,330
While it's one of the,

582
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:35,750
it's a,

583
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,860
it's one of the few,

584
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,770
I think it might be one of
the only large North America.

585
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,540
I think it is it the only,

586
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,550
I think it's the only large
North American mammal.

587
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,510
I have not seen the wild.

588
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:45,270
Wow.

589
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,030
It was a polar bear or the common,

590
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,190
I mean can you go look for him and
you'd have to go to certain spots?

591
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,830
It's very reliable to go
see them in certain areas.

592
00:16:51,831 --> 00:16:54,320
Like on Hudson Bay there's places
where you very reliably find them.

593
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:57,740
In the winter there's places where you
will go and check them out and they you

594
00:16:57,741 --> 00:16:59,690
can like book a tour or
trip and go check them out.

595
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,140
I just haven't seen most frightening
stories I've ever heard was some some boat

596
00:17:03,141 --> 00:17:07,100
crash somewhere and these guys got off
on an ice shelf and a polar bear started

597
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:10,190
getting closer and closer to him and
jumped in the water and climbed up on the

598
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:11,840
ice shell just fucking killed the Nate,

599
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:13,130
one of the guys in front of his friends.

600
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,240
You have toward that to
me felt like kill people.

601
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:17,421
No,

602
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:17,841
they do.

603
00:17:17,841 --> 00:17:18,620
I think.

604
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:23,620
I think that probably in a per capita
sense like deaths attributed the death per

605
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:28,100
number of bear ratio is probably
highest with polar bears.

606
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:29,970
They fucked people up,

607
00:17:29,971 --> 00:17:30,804
man.

608
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,530
Definitely second most high
with with the grizzly bears,

609
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,880
which means a scratch people up.

610
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,790
I would like to get mildly
scratched up by a grizzly bear.

611
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,100
I would like to have,

612
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:40,461
no,

613
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:41,420
I want to have,

614
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,373
I would like to have,

615
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,280
I would like to have one five claws scars

616
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:49,990
where I would like to start

617
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,450
wearing my shirt open all the time.

618
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,140
You should shoot a grizzly
bear and then have a friend ty,

619
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:59,800
the par to a stick just for decoration.

620
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:00,840
So Helen,

621
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,100
yeah.

622
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,870
Listen man.

623
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,380
It was an awesome conversation.

624
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,161
Thank you very much.

625
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:06,240
If you ever want to come back again,

626
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:09,030
please do anytime you're in town
and we could do this 10 times,

627
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:09,864
I guarantee.

628
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,083
Guarantee you.

629
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,520
Thank you.

630
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,353
Thank you very much.

631
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,220
Hey everybody.

632
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,750
We're here with Hamilton Morris
and his buddy Matt the camera man.

633
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:23,930
Man,

634
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:24,950
we don't need to know your last name,

635
00:18:24,951 --> 00:18:25,784
right?

636
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:26,080
No,

637
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,913
that's all right.

638
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,393
Whatever man.

639
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,600
Matt was there the whole time.

640
00:18:29,601 --> 00:18:33,710
We had a podcast looming
over our shoulders making it
very uncomfortable because

641
00:18:33,711 --> 00:18:36,080
there was one person in a
room that didn't fucking talk.

642
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,480
So I tried to say Matt said,

643
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:37,710
hell,

644
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,900
once you become a part of this.

645
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,220
But no,

646
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,050
it's just dedicated to his creepy
filming you and not talking strategy.

647
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,980
I'm glad I had the Imac in front of me
so I didn't have to see how this man,

648
00:18:48,981 --> 00:18:50,300
how come you didn't just hang out with us?

649
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,010
Why wouldn't you just put the
camera now for a little bit?

650
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,330
He's a professional.

651
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,403
Is that what it is?

652
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,890
You're not allowed to test.

653
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,020
Suppose it's my job.

654
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,120
You're not the person ambitious to hear
me talking to on the day cause they

655
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:02,480
just,

656
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:02,841
Oh,

657
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:03,674
I understand.

658
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,150
It would been cool if we
got you in there though.

659
00:19:05,151 --> 00:19:05,984
Matt,

660
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,710
we're going to put you on this.

661
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:10,700
Okay.

662
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,090
We're on.

663
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:11,923
What is this?

664
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,041
This is um,

665
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:16,130
we do a little video blog where
we just put little clips of uh,

666
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,810
people that just did the podcast,

667
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,260
you know,

668
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,460
ask them if they had fun.

669
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:22,131
Yeah.

670
00:19:22,131 --> 00:19:22,521
It's just,

671
00:19:22,521 --> 00:19:25,550
it's just one more piece of
content that people enjoy.

672
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,853
Yeah.

673
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:27,970
God,

674
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,120
I can post podcast wrap
up sort of the thing.

675
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,420
I know it seems ridiculous,

676
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,493
but they love it.

677
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,210
Right?

678
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,120
I mean what was good?

679
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,350
We're just neutral moon,

680
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,580
so here it is.

681
00:19:36,581 --> 00:19:39,820
The next one with you and what we were
saying before we did this was one of the

682
00:19:39,821 --> 00:19:42,910
coolest things about the Internet is
that you could watch somebody stuff like,

683
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,491
and you know,

684
00:19:43,491 --> 00:19:43,750
I was like,

685
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,120
oh,

686
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,521
this guy,

687
00:19:44,521 --> 00:19:45,400
he's fucking crazy.

688
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:46,010
What is he doing?

689
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,300
He's hanging out doing all these drugs
and having a good fucking down to meet

690
00:19:49,301 --> 00:19:50,134
that guy and then boom,

691
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,210
we're doing a podcast killer.

692
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:53,231
Amazing,

693
00:19:53,231 --> 00:19:53,470
right?

694
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,190
Yeah.

695
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,570
It is strange fucking world.

696
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:56,404
We live in

697
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,673
science.

698
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,480
It's craziness.

699
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,830
It's probably witchcraft.

700
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,960
We should have a show
would be the odd couple.

701
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,920
I'll come in and fuck it everyday
I see ghosts and you're like,

702
00:20:08,921 --> 00:20:09,371
listen,

703
00:20:09,371 --> 00:20:10,450
it's a blurry picture.

704
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:11,051
Like,

705
00:20:11,051 --> 00:20:11,681
dude,

706
00:20:11,681 --> 00:20:15,910
my aunt died and this building
and to this day no ghost at all.

707
00:20:15,911 --> 00:20:16,744
I don't believe in any of that.

708
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,320
They'll believe that it's maybe like
what's the most rational argument that

709
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:24,220
someone had was that an experience can
be so traumatic that so much energy is,

710
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:27,040
is released in the form
of emotions and fear,

711
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,310
but it actually stains in area or
that you can go near that area and

712
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:31,780
occasionally and get a little flashback.

713
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:37,450
Steven Cain shining idea and people
hallucinate all the time for various

714
00:20:37,451 --> 00:20:38,284
reasons.

715
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,700
Too Smart for horror movies.

716
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,530
I love horror movies

717
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,880
because I would think you'd be in
there going werewolves are impossible.

718
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,530
Perhaps not fit him.

719
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,580
How's it pants working now?

720
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:51,670
No,

721
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,001
no.

722
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:55,120
I seen every horror
movie out there almost.

723
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,110
And it doesn't make you,

724
00:20:56,111 --> 00:20:56,430
uh,

725
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,263
you don't,

726
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,001
you have to,

727
00:20:58,001 --> 00:20:58,271
you know,

728
00:20:58,271 --> 00:20:59,104
sit there and

729
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,600
look at some ridiculous shit.

730
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:01,811
No,

731
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:02,441
I think it's scary.

732
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:03,274
I'm scared.

733
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,273
What are you scared of?

734
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,070
Slasher films like that con?

735
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:06,791
No,

736
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,230
we can supernatural ones.

737
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:08,860
I mean,

738
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,650
you know,

739
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,210
yeah,

740
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:10,900
kind of.

741
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,411
I haven't watched,

742
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:12,760
I used to watch them all at the time,

743
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,130
like every day really.

744
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:19,660
And then I started to wonder if it
was damaging my mind in some way.

745
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:20,410
Really.

746
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,243
Yeah.

747
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,340
So you think that would
be more than a hundred DMT

748
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:28,480
crazy asshole.

749
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:30,731
Well,

750
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:31,431
you know crazy.

751
00:21:31,431 --> 00:21:36,130
I have to be to be 24 and I've
already done DMT 30 days in a row.

752
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,790
That's something like someone like
cancer does when they're like 90 like,

753
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:40,451
well fuck it.

754
00:21:40,451 --> 00:21:41,284
Let's see what happens.

755
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,050
I don't have to worry about it anymore.

756
00:21:44,051 --> 00:21:44,351
Let's just,

757
00:21:44,351 --> 00:21:45,770
red line is pitch and see what kind of,

758
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,670
you know,

759
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,530
it's just kind of performance.

760
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:48,364
We can get out of it.

761
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,060
You did it.

762
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,090
How old were you when you did it?

763
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:50,651
Reason,

764
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:51,484
I don't know.

765
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:56,020
19 probably about 21 but yeah,

766
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,250
I don't think that's especially damaging,

767
00:21:57,251 --> 00:22:01,810
but inundating your subconscious with
all of these violent images daily seems

768
00:22:01,811 --> 00:22:02,644
like it could.

769
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:03,760
I don't know.

770
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,260
Do you ever worry that someone that's
going to see all this shit that you put

771
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:13,261
online and that you are going to be some
sort of a target for antidrug activists

772
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,543
prove a point.

773
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:22,150
I mean there's people that
are really hate drugs.

774
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,390
It's possible.

775
00:22:25,391 --> 00:22:28,780
I'd be more afraid that it's
just like academic opportunities,

776
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:29,531
job interviews,

777
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:32,410
things like that that you
got to be missing out on.

778
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:33,244
For sure.

779
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:33,611
Listen,

780
00:22:33,611 --> 00:22:34,444
you don't need that.

781
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,410
Just write books,

782
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,041
write books.

783
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,150
He used the internet done.

784
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,090
You can do whatever the fuck you
want and you've got the Internet man.

785
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,171
I mean,

786
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:43,690
it's beautiful to be able to get,

787
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:44,590
you know,

788
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,320
some sort of a job teaching at
some prestigious university.

789
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:48,154
That'd be amazing.

790
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,080
But you know,

791
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,020
it also would be amazing.

792
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,730
You just fucking putting out books,

793
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:52,811
put out books,

794
00:22:52,811 --> 00:22:53,980
keep putting out videos,

795
00:22:53,981 --> 00:22:56,410
keep fucking doing what
you're doing now you're,

796
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,910
you're doing some cool shit.

797
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,093
Yeah.

798
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,630
Well I'd like to do both if possible.

799
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,350
Yeah.

800
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:02,740
Is it,

801
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,270
is it a deterrent or is it,

802
00:23:04,271 --> 00:23:04,541
you know,

803
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:05,450
somehow or another business?

804
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,810
I didn't know it must really excessive,

805
00:23:07,811 --> 00:23:11,110
but there's plenty of people in that good
prestigious university positions that

806
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:14,620
have had sort of histories
of one kind or another.

807
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,400
So it's not,

808
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,233
it's not like,

809
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,630
it's not like getting a job at a
major bank or something like that.

810
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,650
There's also a lot of fear.

811
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:21,610
There's a lot of paranoia.

812
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:25,190
I know people at Mit that
have prescriptions for
Adderall and things like that,

813
00:23:25,191 --> 00:23:27,910
and they were terrified that anyone
would ever find out that they take

814
00:23:27,911 --> 00:23:29,770
prescription stimulants.

815
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,530
What is the deal with Adderall?

816
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,440
Is it that I have a friend
who's on that shit every day.

817
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,670
It just seems to me like
that seems like a weird mood.

818
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,990
It seems like an energy pill.

819
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,441
Oh yeah,

820
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:41,711
it is.

821
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:42,030
Yeah.

822
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,770
So was that someone
should be taken every day.

823
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,340
We'll,

824
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,173
it is a

825
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,410
complicated word,

826
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,150
but I think that certain people
benefit from taking a daily,

827
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,680
this dude looks like he's aging rapidly.

828
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,043
It's possible.

829
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:57,641
It's possible.

830
00:23:57,641 --> 00:23:57,861
I mean,

831
00:23:57,861 --> 00:24:01,960
it may accelerate your metabolism
in some way that you think,

832
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:02,420
right?

833
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:02,930
I Dunno.

834
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:03,763
It's hard to say.

835
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,820
I think that if you're taking something
that's on my massive of stimuli and then

836
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:07,940
look at those faces of math,

837
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:08,900
right.

838
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,480
Well I think though,

839
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,500
you don't look that bad.

840
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:16,460
That's hilarious.

841
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,460
That is hilarious.

842
00:24:18,461 --> 00:24:18,561
He,

843
00:24:18,561 --> 00:24:19,610
Heidi Fleiss the airport,

844
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,640
Yardi sobriety,

845
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,920
and then look better after the neck.

846
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:25,671
It's like,

847
00:24:25,671 --> 00:24:28,270
it's not as if they were extremely
attractive people to begin with.

848
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,840
And then I hated math.

849
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,570
Maybe a jacket [inaudible] character.

850
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,310
So I kind of check.

851
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:35,660
You remember picking up in a bar,

852
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,670
you know it's just a mistake.

853
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,350
Dropped a mistake.

854
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:47,090
It's just the perfect end to the weirdest
interviews ever in the history of the

855
00:24:47,091 --> 00:24:47,780
podcast.

856
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,441
Hamilton Morris,

857
00:24:48,441 --> 00:24:51,310
you're a hell of a guy and it was
very awesome having you on the show.

858
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,340
Really interesting stuff that you,

859
00:24:53,341 --> 00:24:58,010
you really most most
informed on socket dogs,

860
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:01,730
especially if any guy I don't think
we ever talked to so it was cool.

861
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,410
It's cool.

862
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,920
I think a lot of people
got a lot out of that man.

863
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,143
Awesome.

864
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:06,350
Hope again.

865
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,490
Weird you out too much.

866
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,710
Hi everybody.

867
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,161
What's happening?

868
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:13,850
Beautiful people.

869
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:14,780
Joe Diaz here.

870
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,730
We just finished a great fucking podcast.

871
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:17,540
Thank you for listening.

872
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,373
We had a good time.

873
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:21,740
I can't believe you still told some
stories that I hadn't heard before,

874
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,180
which was like a bunch of them.

875
00:25:23,181 --> 00:25:24,170
The fucking roofing.

876
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,570
I never heard the story about
you roofing in Colorado.

877
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,260
Same Gray ball and yeah,

878
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,750
the gray mouse store
and there's another one.

879
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:30,830
I haven't heard of it before.

880
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,320
It's always something we always
have a good fucking time though.

881
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:33,971
The Aspen.

882
00:25:33,971 --> 00:25:35,210
It sounds like a fucking trip.

883
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,070
It wasn't true.

884
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,903
I still today

885
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,660
that's a kind of a fucked up
place where Charlie Sheen that is,

886
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,573
that's her child.

887
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,570
Mueller held that bitch down.

888
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,530
Yeah.

889
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:49,880
Is it a coke a?

890
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,390
It's,

891
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:56,360
it's a place where people with means
go and park camp potty and you know the

892
00:25:56,361 --> 00:25:58,040
cops Kona it's going to be okay.

893
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,780
He doesn't make it to aspen.

894
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,813
Protect their own.

895
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:02,770
Brian.

896
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,620
So let me ask you,

897
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,603
what's it like?

898
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,050
That's quad has reached

899
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:12,950
its great temporarily
in with the big boys.

900
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,180
It's cool.

901
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:14,520
Yeah.

902
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,440
Well if you do it once,

903
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:16,780
you can continue to keep doing it.

904
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,880
A lot of work though,

905
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,710
like you're constantly,

906
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,330
it's paying off and it's funny
how these guys leave that.

907
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:25,910
That's called a million.

908
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,240
Well I fuck your pawn password for that.

909
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,130
That's where it makes sense.

910
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,060
I mean if you think about it,

911
00:26:32,061 --> 00:26:33,010
we have to get

912
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,700
regulations strengthened.

913
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:40,310
Fucking numbers and numbers are power.

914
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,593
Wealth,

915
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:42,643
ladies and gentlemen.

916
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,810
Thanks for two next weekend,

917
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:45,401
Chicago.

918
00:26:45,401 --> 00:26:46,770
And then by the time this video's out,

919
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,120
it'd be a year ago.

920
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:55,020
We have a Chicago theater date and a
couple of days and we're getting fired up

921
00:26:55,021 --> 00:26:55,601
for this video.

922
00:26:55,601 --> 00:26:56,401
I'll be off of Vegas.

923
00:26:56,401 --> 00:26:57,360
Go to fucking Vegas.

924
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:57,961
Vegas.

925
00:26:57,961 --> 00:26:58,351
February.

926
00:26:58,351 --> 00:27:00,030
Third House of Blues.

927
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,800
You savages stand black.

928
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:03,840
Stay black and a fall.

929
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:04,800
Joey Diaz on Twitter.

930
00:27:04,801 --> 00:27:05,820
It's mad flavor.

931
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:06,670
Red Band.

932
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,130
Are we fee feed Minneapolis?

933
00:27:08,131 --> 00:27:08,730
All that shit.

934
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,870
See you see you

935
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:12,850
right here.

936
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:13,683
Here we are.

937
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,300
Powerful.

938
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,420
C Two l shell for c two o

939
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:22,861
but it is lifted,

940
00:27:22,861 --> 00:27:23,430
right?

941
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,540
I heard you can shoot it up.

942
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:25,560
Yeah you can.

943
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:30,380
It's like a thing that he did and like
the fucking Vietnam War substituted for

944
00:27:30,381 --> 00:27:31,900
Ivy and the South Pacific.

945
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,633
Not Crazy.

946
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,970
Just go running to your veins like water.

947
00:27:35,971 --> 00:27:36,810
Like when you get a drip.

948
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,590
Yup.

949
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,460
It's like an Ivy Tripp,

950
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,323
coconut water,

951
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,230
coffee enemas.

952
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,080
I've heard of a lot of different things.

953
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:43,591
What does that do?

954
00:27:43,591 --> 00:27:44,790
Is they give you a crazy buzz?

955
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,880
I thought it was just really good for you.

956
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,680
Healthy,

957
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,513
but why is it healthy?

958
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,720
I think the caffeine,

959
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,350
I don't know.

960
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,080
Just cleans out the inside.

961
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,420
What about that woman who did a DMT enema?

962
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,640
That's that girl Hamilton Morrison.

963
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,190
Oh by the way,

964
00:28:02,191 --> 00:28:03,820
for any of this saw the
Hamilton Morris interview,

965
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,341
we fucked up.

966
00:28:05,341 --> 00:28:06,174
We're so sorry.

967
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,100
We got Hamilton way too high.

968
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,750
We got way too high.

969
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,940
We just completely over modulated.

970
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:16,260
Sometimes when you go to these
dispensaries you forget like when you buy

971
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:16,920
something,

972
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,880
whether it's an indycar or
a sativa you forget and uh,

973
00:28:20,881 --> 00:28:23,310
there was definitely
a sativa or excuse me,

974
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,300
definitely an Indycar,

975
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:28,670
which is like the stuff that makes you
sleep here and it was way too strong.

976
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,920
We were all off the tracks and into
the woods and we were trying to keep a

977
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:32,700
conversation together,

978
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,360
but we were just ball.

979
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,490
Here's an artist's
rendering of it right here.

980
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:37,853
Yeah,

981
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:39,743
exactly.

982
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:40,350
It was real.

983
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,183
It was preposterous.

984
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,860
The fact that we pulled together
any sort of a podcast was amazing.

985
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,690
He kept fucking with his
boys who would get it.

986
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:46,140
Like really?

987
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:46,410
Dude,

988
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:46,981
he was so high.

989
00:28:46,981 --> 00:28:49,710
He was like playing with his voice
and that was freaking me out.

990
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,340
I love that dude though.

991
00:28:53,341 --> 00:28:56,910
How I love anybody who's out
there doing wild shit like that.

992
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,230
I love anybody who's out there just
fully embracing the free culture.

993
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,040
And you know,

994
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,100
pushing forward and he did a really
cool thing with the isolation tank

995
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,790
manufacturers.

996
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,830
He went down there and film
there and he took an ad,

997
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:08,910
a ball before he got in.

998
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:10,771
I said,

999
00:29:10,771 --> 00:29:13,590
just take some like an hour and a half
before you go on it and be perfect.

1000
00:29:13,591 --> 00:29:15,930
It just get in there and ride
it and that's exactly he did,

1001
00:29:15,931 --> 00:29:16,980
he said was amazing.

1002
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,870
I went for a three hour ride.

1003
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,751
Wow.

1004
00:29:19,751 --> 00:29:22,440
It's super high on a pot
Brownie and an isolation tank.

1005
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,310
I get one of that.

1006
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,580
That's what you and I got to do next,

1007
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:27,414
dude.

1008
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,490
You and I and the Onnit guys,

1009
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,500
we're going to start
opening up tank centers.

1010
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,750
I had a conversation today,

1011
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:37,860
I was doing this interview for our
Vegas show next week and I'm doing this

1012
00:29:38,011 --> 00:29:38,940
interview and I'm like,

1013
00:29:38,941 --> 00:29:39,121
you know,

1014
00:29:39,121 --> 00:29:41,770
talking about the woman asks
me about isolation and I said,

1015
00:29:41,771 --> 00:29:41,961
yeah,

1016
00:29:41,961 --> 00:29:42,020
I

1017
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,131
go,

1018
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:43,210
they're really hard to find.

1019
00:29:43,211 --> 00:29:43,391
You know,

1020
00:29:43,391 --> 00:29:44,950
there's a few places in California,

1021
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:47,180
but I know that used to be a place
in Vegas and I thought about,

1022
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:47,441
I'm like,

1023
00:29:47,441 --> 00:29:48,430
why are they hard to find?

1024
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,091
Why?

1025
00:29:49,091 --> 00:29:50,640
Just to start making tanks that great.

1026
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,100
Yeah.

1027
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:51,281
Yeah.

1028
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:52,530
There's fucking tanning centers.

1029
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:52,960
Math,

1030
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,250
you think they couldn't be tank centers.

1031
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:54,880
And by the way,

1032
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,381
those tanks,

1033
00:29:55,381 --> 00:29:57,730
here's what a great way
to meet cool people.

1034
00:29:58,570 --> 00:29:59,021
You know,

1035
00:29:59,021 --> 00:30:00,620
go with a bunch of other people that are,

1036
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:01,750
want to explore their consciousness.

1037
00:30:01,751 --> 00:30:03,820
A bunch of other people that
want to relax and float.

1038
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,220
A bunch of other people that are
curious about those sort of things.

1039
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,750
That'd be like a great place if
you have like a big waiting area.

1040
00:30:10,751 --> 00:30:14,110
And it was like really quiet and
couches and shit and magazines.

1041
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:15,820
People would probably hang
out there after there.

1042
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:17,711
Yes,

1043
00:30:17,711 --> 00:30:19,060
you could have little shows there.

1044
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,880
You could have authors come
in and talk about books,

1045
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:22,241
you know,

1046
00:30:22,241 --> 00:30:23,230
books on consciousness.

1047
00:30:23,231 --> 00:30:25,870
You could have psychedelic that guys
like Dennis mechanic come and speak.

1048
00:30:25,871 --> 00:30:26,500
You know,

1049
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,570
let's do it too.

1050
00:30:27,571 --> 00:30:28,510
And we should do that.

1051
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:28,960
Right.

1052
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,520
And I'd see the birth of an idea.

1053
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,530
This is totally what
the next stage we'll do.

1054
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:36,360
That's how I'm gonna move my friend Tommy
junior from Connecticut to having to

1055
00:30:36,361 --> 00:30:37,194
come down and run our,

1056
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,160
our tank centers.

1057
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,003
And yeah,

1058
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,570
we need to fucking figure out a way to
make ourselves completely self sustaining

1059
00:30:43,571 --> 00:30:45,130
outside of the mechanism of Hollywood.

1060
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,260
It's totally do I have an idea,

1061
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:48,850
but I'm not going to say on the air.

1062
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:49,763
Powerful,

1063
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:50,823
powerful,

1064
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:58,100
powerful time limits on power for
led Lazarus and your dog's name.

1065
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,730
Blanche Blanche.

1066
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:04,290
Eliza is one of those crazy dog ladies
that brings her dog everywhere she goes,

1067
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:04,690
wouldn't it?

1068
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:08,220
Comedy clubs and she brings her
dog to the icehouse chronicles.

1069
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:11,110
The darn just fucking wanders out
around the streets of Pasadena.

1070
00:31:11,111 --> 00:31:13,270
We had to go running after
it while she was on stage.

1071
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,161
That's snuck out.

1072
00:31:14,161 --> 00:31:14,351
Yeah.

1073
00:31:14,351 --> 00:31:14,490
No.

1074
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,370
When he was watching her,

1075
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:15,701
nobody.

1076
00:31:15,701 --> 00:31:17,110
You left her there and
nobody was watching her.

1077
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,550
She didn't know why you weren't there.

1078
00:31:18,551 --> 00:31:19,390
She went looking for you.

1079
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:22,060
Why don't you just leave her in your
car when you do stuff like that?

1080
00:31:22,061 --> 00:31:22,970
It's not hot out.

1081
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,290
I'm the only car for a sec.

1082
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,820
Someone steals your car.

1083
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,053
Okay.

1084
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,670
I guess you could look at it that way.

1085
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,170
If someone's a glass
half empty sort of get,

1086
00:31:33,171 --> 00:31:34,120
I wasn't cheap

1087
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:36,530
back then.

1088
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,630
You could make book bags.

1089
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:38,770
You can keep her inside the perfect

1090
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:41,351
messenger.

1091
00:31:41,351 --> 00:31:44,860
You're probably the most aggressive
female comedian we know what's,

1092
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,030
what's the secret to that?

1093
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,253
Yeah.

1094
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,093
What's that about?

1095
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,653
You're very

1096
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,043
just doing the video.

1097
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,130
What's the sea?

1098
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:55,260
Yeah,

1099
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,480
you're fucking on stage.

1100
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,080
The audience came to have a good time,

1101
00:31:59,081 --> 00:32:00,310
but I give it to him.

1102
00:32:00,311 --> 00:32:01,144
None of us.

1103
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,340
I do mind like that.

1104
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:03,581
Right?

1105
00:32:03,581 --> 00:32:05,020
Do you get upset when you see people?

1106
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:05,860
What else?

1107
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,461
What else?

1108
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:07,800
And they're like flip through their notes.

1109
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,930
It was like 12 people in the crowd
and you're working something out.

1110
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:11,231
Okay.

1111
00:32:11,231 --> 00:32:13,720
But I just feel like an
audience came there drunk.

1112
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:14,531
It's a Saturday night.

1113
00:32:14,531 --> 00:32:15,760
They worked hard all week.

1114
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,950
They want to cry from laughing and that's,

1115
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:18,940
and I have a lot of energy.

1116
00:32:18,941 --> 00:32:21,190
I like to move around and
wouldn't give it to him proper.

1117
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:22,443
Yeah,

1118
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:25,190
I hear Ya am aggressive but got to get

1119
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:27,461
well.

1120
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:27,821
It's good.

1121
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:28,780
You have a great personality.

1122
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,070
It's not,

1123
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:29,891
it's not a bad thing.

1124
00:32:29,891 --> 00:32:31,100
It's just unusual.

1125
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,020
You're not unusual girl.

1126
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,490
You have a lot of lesbian qualities,

1127
00:32:33,491 --> 00:32:35,830
but you're no less than drove a blazer.

1128
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:36,664
I told you that.

1129
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:37,850
Is that good?

1130
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:39,040
Did it have a bass on the back?

1131
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,510
It,

1132
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,020
nobody had a

1133
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,790
splash decal on the side and my
parents told me that I picked that one.

1134
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:44,301
I don't know,

1135
00:32:44,301 --> 00:32:45,250
recollection of that.

1136
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,920
Pick the splashing out of
all the Chevy's in the lawn.

1137
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:48,350
I was like,

1138
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:48,540
oh,

1139
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,091
at the splash.

1140
00:32:49,091 --> 00:32:49,924
Do you Kent?

1141
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,633
Thanks team.

1142
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,600
Did you have like a roll
cigarettes in your sleeve?

1143
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:53,991
No,

1144
00:32:53,991 --> 00:32:55,150
but I do have a,

1145
00:32:55,151 --> 00:32:59,800
a pen Sean first leads without the
shirts or shirts with the sleeves rather

1146
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,680
get out and sleeves.

1147
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,120
Isn't it fucked up when
you do something like that?

1148
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:10,250
You reverse something and you
have no idea you did it never.

1149
00:33:10,251 --> 00:33:11,084
It's like what?

1150
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,960
I didn't make a big deal.

1151
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,490
Well not only that,

1152
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,820
like you know that you don't even know
what the fuck happened and I believe you

1153
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:19,060
made a mistake like that cause
you know I was articulate.

1154
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:19,461
I know,

1155
00:33:19,461 --> 00:33:20,720
but then they'll call you back the tape.

1156
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:21,400
That's the problem.

1157
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,740
Like the podcasts or see myself say
something on the podcast like one time I

1158
00:33:24,741 --> 00:33:24,921
said,

1159
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:25,071
yeah,

1160
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:25,640
it's like,

1161
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,250
it's like pcs versus a windows,

1162
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,750
which is the opposite.

1163
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:30,843
It's

1164
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:36,850
like they get the jest and they correct.

1165
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,073
Correct.

1166
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:42,330
Do you know the difference
actually along that,

1167
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:42,710
what am I,

1168
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,240
what I hate is when you go
to give someone directions,

1169
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:44,451
you're like,

1170
00:33:44,451 --> 00:33:45,530
it's right up here on that road.

1171
00:33:45,531 --> 00:33:45,771
They're like,

1172
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:49,920
you made over here and like from inside
a building or like who has spatial

1173
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,720
relations that much on the

1174
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,021
30th floor,

1175
00:33:54,021 --> 00:33:54,854
one or

1176
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,033
none of that

1177
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,040
fucking assholes.

1178
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,690
Just be nice to Eliza.

1179
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,850
Who's a good person?

1180
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,010
Why do you make dudes uncomfortable?

1181
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:07,920
We think that's all up.

1182
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:08,880
No,

1183
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,770
it's not my problem

1184
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,190
meeting with me.

1185
00:34:13,191 --> 00:34:14,240
If I make you uncomfortable,

1186
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,170
let me know.

1187
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:17,960
He'd make me a little unclear.

1188
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:18,470
No,

1189
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:18,921
I've seen,

1190
00:34:18,921 --> 00:34:20,480
you know,

1191
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,070
that's not what I said.

1192
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:23,360
No.

1193
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,193
Uh,

1194
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,083
I don't.

1195
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,240
No,

1196
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:26,780
but there's,

1197
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,670
there's no men are intimidated
by intelligent women.

1198
00:34:28,671 --> 00:34:29,111
First of all,

1199
00:34:29,111 --> 00:34:29,944
men are,

1200
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,780
a lot of men don't want
the game to be difficult.

1201
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,350
It's already difficult to
get a girl like you and to,

1202
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:38,270
you have to measure up to a
girl as well as other men.

1203
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:38,601
You know?

1204
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:41,060
Like that's why from the get go,

1205
00:34:41,061 --> 00:34:41,391
I'm like,

1206
00:34:41,391 --> 00:34:42,640
you don't have to be smarter.

1207
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,190
Funny.

1208
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,540
As long as you're really hot.

1209
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:47,660
So you just like have guys
that are just nice to you guys.

1210
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,820
The guys smarter invited him.

1211
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:49,641
He hasn't have to be hot.

1212
00:34:49,641 --> 00:34:50,151
That's okay too,

1213
00:34:50,151 --> 00:34:52,130
but you have to somewhere
you gotta be better than me.

1214
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:57,730
So you could be not funny or smart but
hot or or be funny and smart and not so

1215
00:34:58,641 --> 00:34:59,150
hot.

1216
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,400
Those are the two I was
funny and smart can be hot.

1217
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:02,743
I see what you're saying.

1218
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:07,490
So you're just like a guy and a lot of
ways like guys don't like most guys don't

1219
00:35:07,491 --> 00:35:10,850
need grocery that's foreign or
that they are going to be around.

1220
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,940
Well someone said this and I would
always attributed to George Harrison,

1221
00:35:13,941 --> 00:35:15,470
although I can't find it
online or they said it,

1222
00:35:15,471 --> 00:35:18,890
but I'm pretty sure he did say he
said all I need from a woman is to be

1223
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:19,640
attracted to her.

1224
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,740
Everything else I get from him,

1225
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,583
man,

1226
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:23,283
that's really,

1227
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,310
I remember much more current that going,

1228
00:35:25,311 --> 00:35:25,600
God,

1229
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,720
that's so brilliant.

1230
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:29,360
Women are much more complex
and some of them for sure,

1231
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,450
some of them,

1232
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,283
some of

1233
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,183
what's interpreters,

1234
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,910
we need so many like yeah,

1235
00:35:34,911 --> 00:35:35,780
you need a guy to be hot,

1236
00:35:35,781 --> 00:35:36,171
but then it's like,

1237
00:35:36,171 --> 00:35:38,640
but he has to understand me
and listen and not do that as,

1238
00:35:38,641 --> 00:35:41,940
and it has to be 75 degrees and I
want to fund restaurant and wedges.

1239
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:42,803
Like

1240
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,000
no,

1241
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,230
I'm very low maintenance,

1242
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,030
super low maintenance,

1243
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,190
super specific about what you want.

1244
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,120
It's,

1245
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,470
it's demanding and like a cute way.

1246
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,550
Like you would never get annoyed.

1247
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:53,820
Okay.

1248
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,380
Are you sure you're not
an asshole about it?

1249
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:55,740
Yeah,

1250
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,070
it was.

1251
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,790
It comes time to food then it has to,

1252
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,840
has to be your why.

1253
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:03,810
So like if you don't care really I think,

1254
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:07,500
what do you like that like you
have arguments with any man about,

1255
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:08,271
it's not about way,

1256
00:36:08,271 --> 00:36:10,230
it's why I don't want to eat in the car.

1257
00:36:10,231 --> 00:36:10,801
The guy and he's,

1258
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:11,101
I'm like,

1259
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:11,491
I'm hungry.

1260
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:11,970
He's like,

1261
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:12,731
you want to go?

1262
00:36:12,731 --> 00:36:13,471
Or where do you want to go eat?

1263
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,360
And I'm anything he says I don't want,

1264
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,690
I don't want to get barbecue in
the middle at noon on a Tuesday.

1265
00:36:18,691 --> 00:36:21,720
I just woke up in the middle of the day.

1266
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,460
I'm going to get a heavy
and I'll get coffee.

1267
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:24,560
You ever need to talk to her?

1268
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,890
Hughley Walkleys in Van Nuys.

1269
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,140
So cool.

1270
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:29,663
So

1271
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:31,930
I do,

1272
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:32,490
I like me,

1273
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,470
but at the dinner,

1274
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,333
but a dinner,

1275
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:37,580
I just woke up maybe like
some of the lighter gender.

1276
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,423
You're a carnivore.

1277
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,470
I like the Tourist Korea's,

1278
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,041
oh,

1279
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:42,000
the Brazilian restaurants.

1280
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:46,380
[inaudible] Japanese Bahrein and I'm
eating fucking almost every one of them.

1281
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,330
Even the faithfulness.

1282
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,900
We ate it in Chicago.

1283
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:52,623
Fuck.

1284
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,483
The child's are awesome.

1285
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:54,421
And the Japanese,

1286
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:55,201
when you can make your own,

1287
00:36:55,201 --> 00:36:57,020
they have guy who Kako Laci.

1288
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,730
And I got so fucking Shit,

1289
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:01,790

1292
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,413

Jesus had bad breath.

1295
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:07,830
No,

1296
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,521
it smells good.

1297
00:37:08,521 --> 00:37:10,260
I thought like someone gets a barbecue.

1298
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,293

we just got done up beautiful podcast
with my friend Brian Count and my friend

1323
00:37:52,591 --> 00:37:57,591
Jimmy Burke and you're crying
and gentlemen is a life changer.

1324
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,251
And I'm doing this,

1325
00:37:59,251 --> 00:37:59,550
uh,

1326
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,450
what is this thing called?

1327
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,290
Turbo Sonic.

1328
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:02,370
I'm doing a turbo sonic,

1329
00:38:02,371 --> 00:38:04,350
which is sound waves that
go through your body.

1330
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:06,030
And I've actually never
had this sensation.

1331
00:38:06,031 --> 00:38:08,420
It's a really weird feeling right now.

1332
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,840
And I can hear my voice.

1333
00:38:09,841 --> 00:38:10,860
I actually can't control it.

1334
00:38:10,861 --> 00:38:12,590
That's how I'm talking the sound.

1335
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:17,100
This is a giant speaker and it's sonic
waves that are forcing his body to

1336
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:21,450
vibrate and keep an eye on because right
now this is like the high frequency end

1337
00:38:21,451 --> 00:38:21,870
of it,

1338
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:26,870
but then it gets to this both studying
frequency like their and totally surface.

1339
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,083
Now you hear it,

1340
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,360
it,

1341
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,001
it varies.

1342
00:38:30,001 --> 00:38:30,571
There's like a whole,

1343
00:38:30,571 --> 00:38:33,030
you can do it manual and you can
have it set to a certain level.

1344
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,840
It's not just being chickens,

1345
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:36,070
it's

1346
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,570
actually sonic waves.

1347
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,730
So when you say you're being shaken,

1348
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,880
you sort of odd,

1349
00:38:40,881 --> 00:38:42,010
but it's not like so much shaking.

1350
00:38:42,011 --> 00:38:46,780
You sonic waves through your whole body
MNA through your fucking feet from a

1351
00:38:46,781 --> 00:38:50,560
speaker and the Russian scientists
with users when they're in space,

1352
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:54,490
use this to stay up in orbit far longer
than anybody thought was possible.

1353
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:55,571
Yeah,

1354
00:38:55,571 --> 00:38:56,231
it stimulates.

1355
00:38:56,231 --> 00:38:58,960
You might have said something similar as
your body's ability to produce you with

1356
00:38:58,961 --> 00:38:59,680
growth hormone.

1357
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,513
It's great for you.

1358
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,830
It's fantastic for their muscle density.

1359
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:03,970
Yeah,

1360
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:04,370
yeah.

1361
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:04,810
It,

1362
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:05,360
oh yeah.

1363
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,140
It's amazing.

1364
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,120
It's unbelievable.

1365
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,670
All of the whole time I've been
having here for some reason.

1366
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,680
It's how you saved my life.

1367
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,910
When I got that girl pregnant and
I was going to marry her and you,

1368
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,830
he literally started to flip out.

1369
00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:18,760
You don't want to lose it,

1370
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,211
dude.

1371
00:39:19,211 --> 00:39:19,941
I used to host.

1372
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:20,800
It protects you.

1373
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,720
I protected him from so many girls.

1374
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,340
There was so many times
he was with a girl.

1375
00:39:24,341 --> 00:39:24,641
I was like,

1376
00:39:24,641 --> 00:39:26,740
what the fuck are you more?

1377
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:30,460
I would have saved a lot of times when
you got into before your your lovely

1378
00:39:30,461 --> 00:39:30,731
wife,

1379
00:39:30,731 --> 00:39:34,930
you've got into a lot of a hose situations
where you were saving a lot of fucked

1380
00:39:34,931 --> 00:39:35,980
up girls like you've,

1381
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:36,370
you've,

1382
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:39,340
you ran across a lot of lost
children and even when the rest of,

1383
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,630
and I don't want to go with a good family,

1384
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:42,940
I want to go with the track marks
in the bat tattooed on her face.

1385
00:39:42,941 --> 00:39:43,211
Please.

1386
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:44,070
That sounds like a tragic,

1387
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:45,821
yeah,

1388
00:39:45,821 --> 00:39:46,280
there was a,

1389
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,130
there was a quite a few
situations where I was like,

1390
00:39:48,131 --> 00:39:48,460
what?

1391
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,510
What are you doing man?

1392
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:50,590
What the fuck are you doing?

1393
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,060
Patty was the only one.

1394
00:39:52,061 --> 00:39:53,680
Patty actually called
me up and thanked me.

1395
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:54,663
She goes,

1396
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,030
the only one that talks
everybody else was like,

1397
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:58,690
Oh man,

1398
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,200
I guess you're having a baby flipped out.

1399
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:00,521
I was like,

1400
00:40:00,521 --> 00:40:01,354
you're having a baby with her,

1401
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,120
like you can't do this.

1402
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,233
Flipped out.

1403
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,283
He literally started to,

1404
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:09,130
I was screaming at him because I saw him
convincing himself that it was going to

1405
00:40:09,131 --> 00:40:09,790
be okay.

1406
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:10,061
I go,

1407
00:40:10,061 --> 00:40:10,331
dude,

1408
00:40:10,331 --> 00:40:13,270
you do not want to enter into any sort
of situation with this girl for the rest

1409
00:40:13,271 --> 00:40:13,780
of your life.

1410
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,830
I go visit out of your hands.

1411
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:15,551
You can't control it.

1412
00:40:15,551 --> 00:40:15,981
That's fine.

1413
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:16,211
I'll go,

1414
00:40:16,211 --> 00:40:19,650
but you do not want a
longterm relationship with
this crazy bitch when you can

1415
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,050
avoid him.

1416
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,810
Please do these crazy well.

1417
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:23,891
Life is crazy,

1418
00:40:23,891 --> 00:40:24,181
dude.

1419
00:40:24,181 --> 00:40:24,611
And you know,

1420
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:26,050
as we develop,

1421
00:40:26,051 --> 00:40:27,650
we realized that we are a,

1422
00:40:27,651 --> 00:40:31,180
a bunch of deficits that we have when
we're younger and we're still trying to

1423
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:34,150
make up for shaking like a leaf.

1424
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,460
It's not even the machine.

1425
00:40:36,461 --> 00:40:37,900
This is how I'm thinking about his past.

1426
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:38,853
That's what it is.

1427
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,001
Crazy,

1428
00:40:40,001 --> 00:40:40,470
isn't it?

1429
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:40,810
Yeah.

1430
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:41,880
Isn't it awesome that feels,

1431
00:40:41,881 --> 00:40:45,360
it makes you feel great and it feels
stimulated when you get off of the ads.

1432
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:49,670
And it's also exactly what Christopher
and Mcdonald's in his book.

1433
00:40:49,671 --> 00:40:50,391
And what's that book,

1434
00:40:50,391 --> 00:40:50,990
Bubba?

1435
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:51,380
The,

1436
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,140
uh,

1437
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:55,040
the running book born to run.

1438
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:55,941
It's an awesome book.

1439
00:40:55,941 --> 00:40:56,450
You have to read.

1440
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:56,661
Oh,

1441
00:40:56,661 --> 00:40:57,260
I'd love to.

1442
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,093
What does that,

1443
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:58,920
no,

1444
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,753
no number on it.

1445
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:01,820
This guy,

1446
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:05,030
because this was for big
kind of Lanky Irish guy,

1447
00:41:05,031 --> 00:41:06,740
I love to run in his late forties,

1448
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:12,100
he heard about this tower who more a
tribe in Mexico that were running ultra

1449
00:41:12,891 --> 00:41:13,724
marathons,

1450
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,511
40,

1451
00:41:14,511 --> 00:41:14,901
50,

1452
00:41:14,901 --> 00:41:15,261
60,

1453
00:41:15,261 --> 00:41:15,800
70,

1454
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,241
80,

1455
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:18,050
a hundred miles in a day.

1456
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,250
And no,

1457
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,203
not bare feet.

1458
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:22,130
They were taking down tires,

1459
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,030
cutting them down,

1460
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:23,841
melting them,

1461
00:41:23,841 --> 00:41:27,620
and they just having the smallest bit
of rubber on the bottom of their feet.

1462
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,970
They just conformed for their feet.

1463
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,610
So basically it was like they were running
barefoot because they're going over

1464
00:41:31,611 --> 00:41:35,630
rocks and boulders and cactus
and 400 miles in the desert.

1465
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:38,150
So they melted down times and had
to get them to stick to their fear.

1466
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:38,811
They just,

1467
00:41:38,811 --> 00:41:39,410
uh,

1468
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:43,510
they took twine and they just took
leather title and meet up there.

1469
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,170
Any primitive sandal.

1470
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,040
Now I wear these.

1471
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,090
That's kind of what they did.

1472
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,680
They took a very,

1473
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:56,780
there's no heel because your feet or
telling y'all the first thing and then

1474
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,620
usually the only thing that's touching
the ground when you're walking and so of

1475
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:02,060
course it's affecting your nervous system,

1476
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:02,720
your feet,

1477
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,560
or telling you what to do.

1478
00:42:03,561 --> 00:42:06,290
You're free sending right
now as I'm moving around,

1479
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:11,240
my feet are sending off and be just my
brain [inaudible] behind those Vibram

1480
00:42:11,241 --> 00:42:12,110
five fingers.

1481
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:12,321
She,

1482
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,230
where did we go for?

1483
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,810
I know what else I do.

1484
00:42:14,811 --> 00:42:15,920
I lift weights barefoot.

1485
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,120
Absolutely.

1486
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:17,540
Me Too.

1487
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,250
I wouldn't buy items.

1488
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,990
I don't where I don't go
buy from Steve Maxwell.

1489
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,550
I got that from Tim Ferriss's book.

1490
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,493
God,

1491
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,850
I got to like Steal Maxwell.

1492
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,110
He had me doing everything barefoot.

1493
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,080
Kettlebells barefoot.

1494
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:27,650
Yeah,

1495
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:30,500
because you can lift more and you
feel it through your toes too.

1496
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:32,060
You feel better?

1497
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:32,330
Yes.

1498
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,710
Your nervous system is becoming,

1499
00:42:33,711 --> 00:42:35,300
being gay with the more we have heels,

1500
00:42:35,301 --> 00:42:36,860
the more we have shit on
the bottom of our feet.

1501
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:39,500
The more insulated we are from the world,

1502
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,660
that when someone created a running shoe,

1503
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,240
what they did is they created
it so that when you land,

1504
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,920
you land on your heel,

1505
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,840
puts this pounding on unique.

1506
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,870
Once you're supposed to lay out your toes,

1507
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,950
that's how people are supposed to run.

1508
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,330
You're supposed to write your chosen.

1509
00:42:53,331 --> 00:42:54,710
It's a shock of exactly.

1510
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,540
That takes all the
pressure off your knees.

1511
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:00,830
So fighters now they do sprints and do
sprints for those five finger tow things

1512
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:02,480
and they run on grass and everyone,

1513
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,430
you know it's a completely
different way to train is change.

1514
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:10,430
Revolutionize like chick training and
nutrition has taken on a revolutionary

1515
00:43:10,431 --> 00:43:10,851
step.

1516
00:43:10,851 --> 00:43:11,121
Like,

1517
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:12,110
like the way guys train.

1518
00:43:12,111 --> 00:43:14,450
How like the intensity
of the short intensity.

1519
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:15,950
It's completely different.

1520
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:16,670
Yeah,

1521
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:17,660
completely there button.

1522
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:22,661
If he is still John's so runs five miles
swims an hour and a half guys twice.

1523
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,030
Freak freak,

1524
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:26,810
freak,

1525
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:27,111
turbo.

1526
00:43:27,111 --> 00:43:27,411
Sonic.

1527
00:43:27,411 --> 00:43:27,951
Ladies and gentlemen,

check it out.

1529
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:29,630
If you find a place where you can

00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,390
float lab in Venice,

1531
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:34,310
they have them at the float lab in Venice.

1532
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:35,503
I stop it.

1533
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:36,343
Just press stop.

1534
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:38,370
Okay.

1535
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:39,200
Just give it one second.

1536
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,180
Let it completely die off
and she know ran up there.

1537
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,381
Ladies and gentlemen,

1538
00:43:42,381 --> 00:43:42,950

1541
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:49,160

the ice house chronicles,

00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,780

1544
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:57,230
which is one of my favorite podcasts
called the Bryan County sheriff because I

1545
00:43:57,231 --> 00:43:57,411
was like,

1546
00:43:57,411 --> 00:43:57,981
what do I name it?

1547
00:43:57,981 --> 00:43:58,820
Something cool and he's like,

1548
00:43:58,890 --> 00:43:59,723
Scott,

1549
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:02,270
you want to make sure
that they know your name.

1550
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:04,310
Your name should be the
like someone's like,

1551
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:05,780
you know like Dunkin is like,

1552
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:08,180
I got to call it the
lavender hour or you go,

1553
00:44:08,181 --> 00:44:10,310
no one's going to remember that
called the Duncan Trussell show.

1554
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:10,581
He's like,

1555
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:13,220
you're right now his new thing
as the Dunkin trials with Joe,

1556

the donkey tries to show,

1557
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,300
but he was calling it the lavender Aga.

1558
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,910
You're missing 50% of the people
that are doing on your podcasts.

1559
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:22,010
It'll leave it at least what the fuck
is going to look for the lavender hour

1560
00:44:22,011 --> 00:44:22,810
man.

1561
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:23,960
But what does that even mean?

1562
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:24,880
What does that even mean?

1563
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:25,770
Weird.

1564
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:27,440

[inaudible]

1586
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,070
there was too much of us at the,

1587
00:44:56,071 --> 00:44:56,551
at the end.

1588
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:57,350
It was a disaster.

1589
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:58,170
We were all drunk,

1590
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,400
but it was still a lighthearted.

1591
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:00,523
Those a lot of fun.

1592
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:02,011
Yeah,

1593
00:45:02,011 --> 00:45:02,850
we pulled it off.

1594
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,550
We know we were talking over
each other when we were hammered,

1595
00:45:05,551 --> 00:45:06,384
but you know,

1596
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:09,190
that's what happens when the camera.

1597
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,440
Thanks man know.

1598
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,420
