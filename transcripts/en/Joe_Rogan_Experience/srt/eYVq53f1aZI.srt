1
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:28,050
No sound is their song.
Jesus fucking Christ.

2
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,100
I should've known.
I couldn't hear myself.

3
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,500
I should've known.
Well,

4
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,990
it's recorded on here.
So the replays,

5
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,460
the replays,
what happened?

6
00:05:34,461 --> 00:05:36,140
But nobody wants to watch the replays.
Goddammit.

7
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,610
Let's recap what I talked.
Hilarious clusterfuck,

8
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,290
haircut,
pause.

9
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,760
We're gonna.
Need that one might be in the audio 

10
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,200
because you hear them well.
Let's recap what we're talking about.

11
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,300
Well,
we're upset here.

12
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:57,430
I said some genius shit.
Probably the most profound shit I've 

13
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,430
ever seen in my life.

14
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,510
Anyway.
What I said in the beginning,

15
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:01,040
the very beginning was that,
um,

16
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,690
I'm excited to do these,
uh,

17
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,760
ustream broadcast and I'm excited that I
decided to do it because I liked doing 

18
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,010
radio interviews and I'm like doing tv 
interviews and that's all fun magazine 

19
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:16,871
stuff was fun,
but it's way cooler to just be able to 

20
00:06:16,871 --> 00:06:16,871
talk to people and answer people's 
questions directly,

21
00:06:16,871 --> 00:06:17,380
you know,
and it's,

22
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,420
it's easy to get a weird impression of 
someone,

23
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,900
you know,
seeing someone on television.

24
00:06:21,901 --> 00:06:24,440
The television represent too,
to a certain extent.

25
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:29,550
You know,
it's like a lot of these guys in the 

26
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:29,550
reality shows to get upset like 
television doesn't,

27
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,160
you know,
it represents you in little snippets and

28
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:32,150
cuts you up,
you know,

29
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:37,330
but the best way to communicate with 
people for sure is the Internet and 

30
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,170
twitter and Ustream.
So combining the two of them together,

31
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,530
what we're doing is,
um,

32
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,260
we're gonna I'm going to do this every 
week.

33
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:47,380
The thing behind me,
all this bullshit behind me that's all 

34
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,621
going to get cleared out and we're gonna
put up a green screen so we could have 

35
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:53,511
like space behind us and shit and we're 
going to have this thing set up at a 

36
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:55,940
little bit more natural angle.
So you'll be looking right at us,

37
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,730
which makes more sense,
right?

38
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,160
Yeah.
You can put it anywhere you want.

39
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,540
You can put it right there.
Is that right?

40
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,560
In the middle?
Yeah.

41
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,040
Yeah.
Move this motherfucker.

42
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,940
But there's the.
I got,

43
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:13,010
I upgraded my internet,
I had some old ass dsl.

44
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,300
It was pretty whack and I got rid of it.
Uh,

45
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,160
today actually,
totally had got it set up.

46
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,640
Is this Scorp now?
Much better.

47
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:23,760
Um,
so,

48
00:07:23,761 --> 00:07:25,110
um,
the,

49
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:30,111
uh,
the DSL is gone and now I got cable and 

50
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:30,111
cables,
fastest flux,

51
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:32,010
so we're going to be able to air videos 
and shit while it's going on.

52
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,850
And um,
my,

53
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,250
my mom designed my office purple shades 
browse around purple.

54
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,940
It's a beautiful color.
You don't like that color

55
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,310
should be fucking black dude with 
skulls.

56
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:47,260
Like your fucking shirt,
bro.

57
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,240
There's nothing wrong with purple,
my friend.

58
00:07:49,241 --> 00:07:51,460
It's a beautiful color.
And there's Brian's he,

59
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:53,920
Brian in the corner there.
Brian is actually right next to me,

60
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,170
but he's getting facebook by that 
advertisement.

61
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,750
You're going to get facebook.
You should move yourself up.

62
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,370
Can you move yourself up right next to 
go?

63
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,680
That's better because you're not going 
to it

64
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:05,650
fucked by that.
Uh,

65
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,800
no.
Don't go all the way up there right 

66
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:10,800
there.
No right number.

67
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Let's move over towards my head.

68
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,630
Go this way,
right?

69
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,580
No,
that's cool.

70
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,740
That's Brian.
Brian's right next door to me

71
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,520
anyway,
we're just talking about the Internet 

72
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:24,520
being an awesome.
It's the fucking coolest thing ever.

73
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,081
I mean,
to be able to communicate with people 

74
00:08:29,081 --> 00:08:31,991
directly like this,
to be able to get the answers to any 

75
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:32,630
question at any time.
To me it's the greatest fucking thing in

76
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:37,631
the world.
I spent most of my day staring at a 

77
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,030
screen reading stories,
watching fucking youtube videos and 

78
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:44,910
have,
I swear I've learned more from the 

79
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,610
Internet more from just being on message
boards than I ever have from,

80
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,050
you know,
from other shit.

81
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:51,500
I've gotten into all sorts of different 
subjects because of message boards,

82
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,250
you know,
and,

83
00:08:52,251 --> 00:08:57,251
and wound up being fans of musicians and
comedians and people I would have never 

84
00:08:57,251 --> 00:08:58,620
heard of.
It wasn't from message boards.

85
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,620
It's like a whole online part.

86
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:05,650
I meet more people online than I do in 
real life now and I don't just live in 

87
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,690
my house.
I go out a lot more people interested in

88
00:09:08,691 --> 00:09:13,691
the same things.
I like to get to know him better on the 

89
00:09:13,691 --> 00:09:13,691
Internet.

90
00:09:13,691 --> 00:09:16,110
Yeah,
well the Internet allows you when 

91
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,080
someone posts for a long time,
especially a message board community,

92
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,420
you get to see how they interact with 
other people.

93
00:09:19,421 --> 00:09:21,370
You get to see what happens when you 
know they're.

94
00:09:21,371 --> 00:09:23,320
They're challenged on their ideas.
You get to see.

95
00:09:23,321 --> 00:09:24,640
You get to see what they're made of.
You know?

96
00:09:24,641 --> 00:09:25,930
It's really interesting.
Yeah.

97
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,080
You would.
The way people write is different than 

98
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,811
the way they talk because people can 
think they're slick and they could try 

99
00:09:33,811 --> 00:09:35,170
to bullshit.
You buy really patiently scribing out.

100
00:09:35,171 --> 00:09:37,480
They're words,
but they're not tricking you.

101
00:09:37,481 --> 00:09:41,320
Eventually eventually that shit just 
comes out because they don't realize how

102
00:09:41,321 --> 00:09:46,321
douchey they are.
They don't realize they think they're 

103
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:46,321
not Douchey,
but in your writing,

104
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:47,650
the Douchey always comes out.
It's like,

105
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:52,651
this is your.
It's your expression is almost like a 

106
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:52,651
printout of you.
It's like,

107
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:52,840
it's like,
you know,

108
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:55,860
like your dna or something like that.
You know what I mean?

109
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,490
Google helps too because then you catch 
a lot of people.

110
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,280
It's the best.
It's the best catch clinical.

111
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,170
What are you talking about?
Check out these photos.

112
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:11,370
Love to talk shit.
People love to pretend that they know 

113
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,961
things.
Nobody wants to pretend that they're 

114
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:13,961
fucking clueless.
You know,

115
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:17,171
everybody wants to be the wizard.
Everybody wants to be the smartest man 

116
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:17,171
in the world,
you know,

117
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:18,410
nobody could just be a person.
You know.

118
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,850
It's real interesting,
man.

119
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,380
It's real,
it's real interesting.

120
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,980
But people love to talk shit and for the
longest time they just got away with it 

121
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,040
for the longest time.
People can bullshit.

122
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,480
I'm going to text message someone says 
is just coming in from Shandra,

123
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,320
are you with Joe?
So any chance of doing a Miami 

124
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,140
interview,
tell that bitch we're doing a podcast.

125
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,410
She should know three to five is 
podcast.

126
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,530
I said bitch with the highest level of 
affection.

127
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,190
So I'll just in fun ladies gentlemen.
So,

128
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,200
um,
what do we got here?

129
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,050
She checked it out.

130
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,620
Any of the photos or videos of that 
hurricane damage.

131
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,140
Have you been here?
The earthquake in Haiti.

132
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:00,980
Earthquake?
Yeah.

133
00:11:00,981 --> 00:11:05,981
I'm sorry,
I haven't seen that man heard the CNN 

134
00:11:05,981 --> 00:11:07,040
thing that I got on my phone.
I get breaking important news stories on

135
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:12,041
my phone.
The last one I got before this one was 

136
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:12,041
that Simon callow's quitting American 
idol.

137
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,980
Motherfuck awful too though.
Is it awful movie?

138
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,570
If you watch American idol without,
that's the only point,

139
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,800
a reason to watch it is past people that
things that he says.

140
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:24,410
I really.
Yeah,

141
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,900
right now.
So he was Ryan seacrest.

142
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,700
Beautiful Hair.
Wasn't saying some brutal dude.

143
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,480
He's genius.
He's a genius.

144
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,640
He's hilarious.
He's one of the best.

145
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,020
Really.
Okay.

146
00:11:36,021 --> 00:11:39,200
I need to wash it off and I don't have a
good opinion of him.

147
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:44,630
My and my opinion of ms dot has always 
mean to these people that are trying 

148
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:44,660
hard to like,
they suck,

149
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,800
you know,
like you can't.

150
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,630
I mean,
I,

151
00:11:46,631 --> 00:11:48,950
I guess he can be mean,
but you know,

152
00:11:48,951 --> 00:11:50,780
why do it?
They're all fucked in the head,

153
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:51,470
you know?
I mean,

154
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,480
I think it's kind of funny,
but that guy puts out a lot of negative 

155
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:56,480
energy.
Well,

156
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,080
he's blatantly honest.
He's like,

157
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,970
he is,
he's not really neat.

158
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:03,520
He's just so honest that it's me.
You know what I mean?

159
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,950
Like he's really interesting when he 
says,

160
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:10,200
because like he'll say he's dead rotted 
percent of the time.

161
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,280
I've only watched it like literally

162
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,520
twice and one that I can remember when I
was so hot.

163
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:20,521
I don't even know what happened,
but one I can remember and it was just 

164
00:12:20,521 --> 00:12:24,270
painfully clueless.
People who are just trying to be like 

165
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:24,880
the shit,
you know,

166
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:29,881
and they'd get out there and they don't 
even know that they have no talent 

167
00:12:29,881 --> 00:12:29,881
whatsoever,
but I know so many people like that from

168
00:12:29,881 --> 00:12:31,390
standup comedy,
you know,

169
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,690
we all know dudes from stand up comedy 
who never feel like they're bombing.

170
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,260
They,
you know,

171
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,240
in the beginning you'd have done open 
Mike Nights.

172
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:38,040
You know what it's like.
There's,

173
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,820
there's some people in an open mic 
night,

174
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:42,820
communities that are crazy and they 
really think they're good and they would

175
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:47,821
love to have an opportunity to do 
something like American idol for 

176
00:12:47,821 --> 00:12:50,311
standup.
They would get up there and go fucking 

177
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:50,311
crazy and be upset and just like those 
American people are,

178
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,900
they get fucking mad.
I've seen some people,

179
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:57,901
they,
they leave that Simon cowel dude and 

180
00:12:57,901 --> 00:12:59,140
start fucking crying and wailing and 
yelling at him.

181
00:12:59,141 --> 00:13:01,140
You don't know Shit Simon,
you know,

182
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,430
they get fucking angry man.
Black women especially.

183
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,590
Right?
I don't even know if black women,

184
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:07,270
especially C to fucking episode.

185
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,470
No,
I'm talking about.

186
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:13,890
Let's talk about black girls get mad 
though because I'm not a huge fan or 

187
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,610
anything,
but every time I see an episode I'm just

188
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,380
bawling.
How hilarious.

189
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,750
Wow.
So he's gonna do his own show called the

190
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:24,751
x factor.
He's basically dual supposedly and so 

191
00:13:24,751 --> 00:13:27,050
he's pretty much going to leave or why 
not have Paula Abdul.

192
00:13:27,051 --> 00:13:27,810
Are they stupid?
They're like,

193
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,110
she's incompetent.
Yeah,

194
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:34,170
that's part of the fun man.
You need to pill that bitch up and just 

195
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:34,870
proper up.
Just shove a broom up,

196
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:37,390
harass and push her forward and get her 
in front of the camera.

197
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,970
Let her talk crazy.
That's part of the fun of the show,

198
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:40,810
right,
isn't it?

199
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,770
Yeah,
I think so.

200
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,930
I don't.
I had the little clips that I would get,

201
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,940
like people send me one of them 
occasionally,

202
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,490
like the one where she said your first 
song,

203
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,770
it was really cool,
but your second side and like.

204
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,740
And they were like,
he only just sang one song,

205
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
like she's so fucking blacked out of it.
You know why she was in a car accident 

206
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,480
real supposedly,
but it's like real pain.

207
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,530
Oh,
well,

208
00:14:02,531 --> 00:14:03,670
you know what happens,
man,

209
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,630
you,
that's what happened.

210
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,360
Breezy and tube.
No car preseason.

211
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,450
Um,
got a,

212
00:14:08,451 --> 00:14:11,510
a real bad injury and took pain pills.
They're,

213
00:14:11,511 --> 00:14:13,550
yeah,
they're the pain pills or a motherfucker

214
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:18,551
man.
I know a lot of people that have had 

215
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:18,551
problems with pain pills,
you know,

216
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:20,540
people with anything sort of a chronic 
problem.

217
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,460
Well you have to take them,
you know,

218
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,520
those motherfuckers there grab a hold of
you and it's not just,

219
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,960
you know,
the week or you know,

220
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:31,961
people like that.
People have a weird opinion of people 

221
00:14:31,961 --> 00:14:31,961
that get hooked on drugs,
you know.

222
00:14:31,961 --> 00:14:34,420
But I've met some Carl prisons,
you know,

223
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:39,430
I dunno,
I dunno if I'm just saying I shouldn't 

224
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:39,430
say Carl because I don't think Carl has 
a problem with them.

225
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,630
I think Carlos and some sort of an 
anxiety disorder,

226
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:46,810
but I know that he had to take them and 
it's hard once you take them to get rid 

227
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,231
of them.
I know a bunch of dudes that like need 

228
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:50,231
them,
you know,

229
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:51,980
like people that have like any sort,
a back injury,

230
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,740
debilitating back injury and that you 
get hooked on those bitches.

231
00:14:54,741 --> 00:14:59,741
And they get you through the day.
I know a lot of people that just need 

232
00:14:59,741 --> 00:14:59,741
that man,
you know,

233
00:14:59,741 --> 00:15:00,990
they need them.
It's just terrible.

234
00:15:00,991 --> 00:15:05,991
And.
But what I was saying is the dudes that 

235
00:15:05,991 --> 00:15:05,991
I know that have had problems with pain 
pills,

236
00:15:05,991 --> 00:15:07,970
a lot of them were like really smart 
guys that went to college.

237
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,260
They're not idiots,
you know?

238
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,640
Do you have the thing in front of my 
face?

239
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,950
I'm moving.
I'm just going to show you this video in

240
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:14,330
a second.
Okay ma'am.

241
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:17,690
But you can't do that.
It's only been a second.

242
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,720
I've seen this.
I know I was going to talk about it.

243
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,880
Okay.
But why do you have it in front of my 

244
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:25,880
fucking face?
I like looking at myself.

245
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,230
Well,
nobody knows what the fuck you're doing.

246
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,290
Yeah,
who cares?

247
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:35,220
It's a fucking webcasts do.
This is serious thing.

248
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:41,070
I totally forgot.
I was even talking about now what was 

249
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:41,070
talking about.
Uh,

250
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,900
actually I was doing this.
You motherfucker.

251
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,450
Stupid Bullshit.
Tell me ladies and gentlemen,

252
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:49,000
what the fuck was I just talking about?
Huh?

253
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,570
Pretty crazy about that dog though.
And I heard that that video.

254
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,580
The dog in the video?
Yeah,

255
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,700
that was a dog that knew about the 
earthquake before the people do.

256
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,800
That's because people hear shit.
They don't pay attention.

257
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,140
The dog heard something is probably what
the fuck.

258
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,030
And the person was like,
what the fuck is that shit?

259
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,300
He didn't react and then it happened 
because it was only like a second before

260
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,500
it.
Here's that video right here.

261
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:12,920
Watch the dog.
It just freaked out and ran.

262
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:18,010
I mean,
but it was a while before even anything 

263
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:18,010
shook.
Let's see it again.

264
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,010
Rewind it.
Here's the dog dogs chilling though.

265
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,320
I was like,
what the fuck is that noise?

266
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,050
Okay.
We don't know that.

267
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:28,120
That dude didn't react.
This is a stupid video,

268
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,210
but this is the problem the dog took off
running,

269
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,030
but the guy you don't see his face.
The guy might've went,

270
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,560
oh shit,
what the fuck?

271
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,890
And everybody is making it like the dog 
heard this before anybody else.

272
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:44,060
But he felt some.
Because if you look at it but nothing's 

273
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:44,060
moving at all.
Right?

274
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,700
But sometimes you hear things before the
earthquake.

275
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,410
Well you know that's true.
You know,

276
00:16:47,411 --> 00:16:49,810
it doesn't really start moving until.
Let me see it again.

277
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,270
Yeah,
you're right.

278
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,410
You're right.
Shit moving.

279
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,790
Maybe it made a sound.
Yeah,

280
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,180
you're right on the ground to that.
It's kind of weird.

281
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:03,470
If there was a sound right,
a real rumble can still see some fingers

282
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,430
monitor.
So.

283
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,890
So the dogs like two second smarter than
a person.

284
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,150
But guess what?
We got thumbs.

285
00:17:09,151 --> 00:17:10,880
Faggot.
Good.

286
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,860
Sure.
Down sleeping dirt.

287
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,320
All right.
What else were we talking about?

288
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:22,321
Folks?
We were talking about some important 

289
00:17:22,321 --> 00:17:22,321
shit and I forgot about God.
Damn.

290
00:17:22,321 --> 00:17:22,570
We got a lot of twitter messages coming 
in this pitch,

291
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,580
that mark mcgwire thing.
That thing is hilarious.

292
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,620
Mark Mcguire is finally coming out and 
saying,

293
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:37,770
well that's what we were talking about.
We're talking about people that are 

294
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:37,770
hooked on pain pills.
You know that.

295
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,050
It's a when when dudes get hooked on 
pain pills,

296
00:17:38,051 --> 00:17:40,330
like I said,
I know a guy who's a very smart guy.

297
00:17:40,331 --> 00:17:42,900
He was an it guy,
went to uh,

298
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,470
you know,
went to college.

299
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,280
Really avid reader,
not a,

300
00:17:47,281 --> 00:17:48,790
not a fuck up.
Has a real.

301
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:49,990
And

302
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,390
that's just what it is,
man.

303
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,110
Dudes.
Dudes get injured,

304
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,510
something happens to you and then adjust
it chemically bonds with your body.

305
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,330
I mean it's really incredible with what 
addiction is,

306
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,310
you know,
conviction is your,

307
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:07,311
your body is somehow or another linked 
to something that's really terrible for 

308
00:18:07,311 --> 00:18:08,520
it and it needs that.
Something like it becomes.

309
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,760
It's almost like like heroin and crystal
meth and stuff like that that really 

310
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,440
locks a hold of your body.
It's almost like they're parasites.

311
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:21,470
It's almost like the drug itself has a 
consciousness and the drug itself is 

312
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:26,160
gonna make you do it as much as you can 
and all and rob you of life.

313
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,610
You know?
I mean that's one way to look at like 

314
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:31,610
horrible substances.
That's why when people talk about drugs,

315
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:36,470
you know,
and they like to lump all drugs in 

316
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:36,470
together.
I love that.

317
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,290
That's so stupid because marijuana and 
mushrooms and psychedelic drugs,

318
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,750
if done correctly,
can be very beneficial and when they're 

319
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,110
over you don't feel any repercussions.

320
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:51,110
You're okay if they don't hurt you,
marijuana and mushrooms and things like 

321
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,380
that.
The natural things that people have been

322
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,950
doing for tens of thousands of years,
those things aren't hurting anybody,

323
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:59,010
man,
and they can't get into your system,

324
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,220
you know,
and if you lump them in with oxycodones 

325
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,250
and fucking heroin and crystal Meth,
that's ridiculous.

326
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,830
Don't want to.
It's becoming a more introspective,

327
00:19:07,831 --> 00:19:11,430
fascinating person on crystal meth.
There'll become and fucking crazy.

328
00:19:11,431 --> 00:19:16,431
It's like we have to look at drugs and 
in terms of what they do to the people 

329
00:19:16,951 --> 00:19:19,860
that take them and do the things that do
positive things.

330
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:22,440
You can't ignore that just because 
they're a drug.

331
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,360
You're not allowed to just say,
oh,

332
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:27,840
because it's an illegal drug than all 
the benefits that people talk about it.

333
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:32,841
Those don't count.
They're invalid just because it's not 

334
00:19:32,841 --> 00:19:32,841
sanctioned by a group of fucking 
criminals.

335
00:19:32,841 --> 00:19:35,010
That's ridiculous.
It doesn't make any sense at all.

336
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,890
And you know,
I've lived my whole life like this.

337
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:43,100
I mean it's 2010.
I would have thought by now we would 

338
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,280
have come to some sort of irrational 
understanding as human beings,

339
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,710
as we got to be adults.
I thought we would come to a point where

340
00:19:46,711 --> 00:19:48,600
we would sit back and we would look at 
things and go,

341
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:49,140
Whoa,
what?

342
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,890
What right?
Do I have to tell another person what to

343
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,620
do or not to do?
As long as he's not trying to give it to

344
00:19:55,621 --> 00:19:57,960
minors or people that don't know any 
better.

345
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:03,050
As long as people are educated,
let's spend money on programs and make 

346
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,441
sure that people don't get involved in 
anything fucked up like this and let's 

347
00:20:06,441 --> 00:20:06,720
pay attention to fucking children in 
schools.

348
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:11,721
I mean,
the biggest problem this country isn't 

349
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:11,721
laws and and crime.

350
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:13,020
The biggest problem is why are people 
creating crime?

351
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:18,021
Why?
Why are people doing these terrible 

352
00:20:18,021 --> 00:20:18,021
things to each other?
90 nine point nine,

353
00:20:18,021 --> 00:20:22,941
nine percent of all fucked up.
Things become out of a fucked up 

354
00:20:22,941 --> 00:20:26,121
childhood.
You have kids who have either a shitty 

355
00:20:26,121 --> 00:20:27,300
fucking parents and in these fucking 
children,

356
00:20:27,301 --> 00:20:29,280
they grow up and they're ticking time 
bombs.

357
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,520
If you have a douchebag fucked up drug 
addict parents and you live in a fucked 

358
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,781
up place with no love and every day you 
just see violence and Shit and screaming

359
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:42,600
and addiction and sorrow and there's no 
way out.

360
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:44,880
You don't see shit.
You don't do well in school.

361
00:20:44,881 --> 00:20:49,881
I mean what the fuck?
That is a ticking time bomb and for 

362
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:54,391
politicians to not address that and to 
spend all this fucking time flying over 

363
00:20:54,391 --> 00:20:59,371
to Afghanistan trying to chase down 100 
Taliban fighters in the mountains and 

364
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,590
young people are dying over there for 
that help out.

365
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,010
We spend that money attacking the 
fucking enemy at home.

366
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:11,250
The enemy at home is a horrible fucking 
childhoods that some of our fellow human

367
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,650
beings in this country have to go 
through.

368
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:19,890
You know,
what we really need to do is focus on 

369
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:20,440
fucking kids.
Focus on children that are growing up in

370
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:25,441
terrible neighborhoods.
Focus on fucking schools and community 

371
00:21:25,441 --> 00:21:27,280
centers and give these kids somewhere to
go to when their parents suck.

372
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,640
You know,
focus on a bunch of people that want to 

373
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,501
help raise kids that come from terrible 
situations or help the parents 

374
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,120
understand what the fuck they're doing,
raising children and,

375
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,980
and making these kids fucking psychos 
and giving them horrible childhoods,

376
00:21:39,981 --> 00:21:44,981
you know,
and then and literally setting loose a 

377
00:21:44,981 --> 00:21:47,701
bomb setting loose.
Someone who's eventually going to turn 

378
00:21:47,701 --> 00:21:51,050
all their,
their inward anger outward and other 

379
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:51,550
people or other their pain and 
resentment and all that.

380
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:54,430
The negative input coming into them as a
child,

381
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,690
you know that shit is fucking terrible.
You deal with a child,

382
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,680
the customer positive loving 
environment,

383
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:04,681
and you're going to deal with a human 
being that human beings going to come 

384
00:22:04,681 --> 00:22:04,780
out of that and going to appreciate 
other people.

385
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,810
That's our number one problem.
As human beings,

386
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,840
our number one problem as human beings 
is the way we don't appreciate each 

387
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,471
other,
the way we look at each other as 

388
00:22:16,471 --> 00:22:18,061
competition,
the way we look at each other as just 

389
00:22:18,061 --> 00:22:18,061
people that are on the highway and my 
fucking way.

390
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:23,250
Human beings have to learn to appreciate
each other and we need to learn how to 

391
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,871
deal with the fucking very obvious shit 
that we ignore instead of pretending 

392
00:22:27,871 --> 00:22:31,360
there's some incredible assault on the 
human race here in America.

393
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,370
You know,
maybe we should look on what.

394
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:37,660
Where does the real crime coming from?
Are the real murders coming from where's

395
00:22:37,661 --> 00:22:41,920
the real anger and violence and the shit
that affects day to day people everyday.

396
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,020
It's not the fucking desert.
Okay.

397
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,880
It's not the fucking mountains of 
Afghanistan.

398
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,820
It's in cities.
It's all over the place.

399
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:53,980
It's,
it's children growing up and becoming 

400
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,011
fucking criminals.
That's way scarier to me than some 

401
00:22:56,011 --> 00:22:56,011
Douche bag in Afghanistan.

402
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,580
You know?
It's nonsense.

403
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,140
Yeah.
Someone said Carl and pills.

404
00:23:04,141 --> 00:23:06,070
Yeah.
That's something Carl's training partner

405
00:23:06,071 --> 00:23:06,990
said,
but like I said,

406
00:23:06,991 --> 00:23:08,170
I don't know if it's true.
Oh,

407
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:12,090
all I know is that he's a.
he's always been a cool dude to me.

408
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:17,120
Carl is a great fighter and he's got 
some unfortunate situations and I hope 

409
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,150
it works out.
I liked that too.

410
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,240
I'd like to do it a lot.
He's good people and he's a bad 

411
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,541
motherfucker.
One of the best judo guys to ever enter 

412
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:26,541
mma,
you know,

413
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:28,020
he uh,
he opened people's eyes to a lot of shit

414
00:23:28,021 --> 00:23:33,021
that was possible because before caro 
nobody was hitting like those beautiful 

415
00:23:33,021 --> 00:23:37,161
fucking throws.
He hits his beautiful shoulder throws 

416
00:23:37,161 --> 00:23:37,770
and hip throws and his,
his judo,

417
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,690
like back when he fought like Dave 
Strasser,

418
00:23:39,691 --> 00:23:42,870
like when it was first a UFC bounce.
Incredible judo,

419
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,640
you know,
and it's,

420
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:48,810
that's an whenever get a guy who steps 
into mma and has some totally something 

421
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:53,981
that he's really,
really good at that most people aren't 

422
00:23:53,981 --> 00:23:53,981
like,
like Machita with karate,

423
00:23:53,981 --> 00:23:54,980
like people will crowd,
isn't that good?

424
00:23:54,981 --> 00:23:58,280
Credit isn't really work until Machida 
came along and were treated.

425
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,820
Machida is so good at karate.
Then he makes karate work in MMA,

426
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,940
you know,
obviously he knows wrestling and 

427
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:06,940
obviously he knows all the other stuff 
that goes with MMA,

428
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,800
which is why it's such a champion.
But the bottom line is his karate,

429
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,750
his ability to move backward.
I mean,

430
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:14,650
he fights like a fucking John Claude van
Damme movie and it's,

431
00:24:14,651 --> 00:24:16,670
it's pretty bad ass to watch,
you know,

432
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:20,390
because until the shogun fight,
he really didn't take hardly any damage.

433
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,450
What do I think about the United Arab 
Emirates buying to Suva?

434
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,910
Well,
I know that the guy who is behind it all

435
00:24:30,911 --> 00:24:33,300
is a chic,
talked noon of uh,

436
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:38,370
uh,
Abu Dhabi and that guy is a huge fan of 

437
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:41,230
mixed martial arts and he's incredibly,
incredibly wealthy.

438
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:43,390
So you know,
that guy can,

439
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,850
he can do a lot of good things for mma.
That guy,

440
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,630
he is a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt 
under Henzel Gracie,

441
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,510
and by all accounts he's legit by all 
accounts.

442
00:24:52,511 --> 00:24:57,280
He's a really good black belt and Hanzo 
is one of the most respected instructors

443
00:24:57,281 --> 00:24:59,740
in the world.
If Henzel gracie gives you a black belt,

444
00:24:59,741 --> 00:25:02,630
that's a huge honor.
So that she talked noon.

445
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,600
The fact that he's a Henzel gracie black
belt.

446
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:08,470
I know he's been having people travel to
Abu Dhabi for years,

447
00:25:08,471 --> 00:25:13,471
for over a decade since the late 
nineties and he had like some of the 

448
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:15,890
best instructors in the world that would
come and stay with him and uh,

449
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,850
he had a whole camp there and you bring 
guys and you have guys to train with.

450
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:19,880
I mean,
dude,

451
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:24,370
it's just the Jujitsu fiend just,
I mean like more than way more than me,

452
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,000
you know,
like,

453
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,910
I mean think about how much I love 
Jujitsu and this guy is like,

454
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:28,840
you know,
he's just like,

455
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:30,940
he loves it and he has unlimited 
resources.

456
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:36,210
So having a guy like that as a business 
partner in the UFC I think is gonna be 

457
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:41,820
phenomenal for the sport.
I don't think there's any question that 

458
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,401
guy is going to without a doubt that God
is going to help out and it's going to 

459
00:25:44,401 --> 00:25:48,541
be interesting to go there.
That lives in a castle like a fucking 

460
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:49,970
some old school out,
you know,

461
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,590
Ali Baba Type Shit,
right?

462
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,900
Yeah.
It's even one without the paintings now.

463
00:25:53,901 --> 00:25:56,550
Who is the guy that I don't know the 
sheik has like,

464
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,200
I think that the royal family is worth 
like some insane amount of money,

465
00:26:00,201 --> 00:26:02,660
like the one of the most richest people 
in the world.

466
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,930
How about that one of the richest people
in the world.

467
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:07,610
That dude is a fucking train killer.

468
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,640
Uh,

469
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,450
do I think is going to take an active 
role like Dana White?

470
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:20,600
I have no idea.
All I do for the UFC is the commentary.

471
00:26:20,601 --> 00:26:25,601
You know what I mean?
I talked to those guys and they're my 

472
00:26:25,601 --> 00:26:25,601
friends,
but obviously I've no,

473
00:26:25,601 --> 00:26:28,340
no influence whatsoever on the business 
side of things.

474
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:33,490
It's just my job to call the action.
It's a really pretty fucking crazy gig.

475
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:39,010
You know,
for me it's like a perfect job because 

476
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,570
I'm a huge fan of mixed martial arts.
Like for real,

477
00:26:41,571 --> 00:26:46,571
like I'm not,
I don't watch like when I watched the 

478
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:50,020
different shows like k one or saying go 
goo or you know,

479
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,590
dream or,
or a strike force or anything like that.

480
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,960
When I watch those shows,
I don't watch those shows for work.

481
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:55,490
I don't,
I don't,

482
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,870
you know,
I don't get on the underground and mixed

483
00:26:57,871 --> 00:26:59,880
martial arts that come or,
you know,

484
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,030
read all the bloody elbow,
read all these different websites and do

485
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:04,470
it just for,
for fun.

486
00:27:04,471 --> 00:27:06,810
I would have done it even if I would 
have done it,

487
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,690
even if it wasn't my job.
I'm just a huge fan,

488
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:12,140
like professionally and I'm very lucky,
you know,

489
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,550
it's pretty crazy gig man.
So a lot of fun.

490
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,190
It's cool too because we get to go to 
the fights and you know,

491
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,220
be there live and be right in front of 
the cage.

492
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,750
I mean it's just like there's nothing 
like that.

493
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,870
What do you think of the last year?
I've seen some good fights,

494
00:27:27,871 --> 00:27:29,090
man.
Did you see it?

495
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,060
Yeah.
That Evan Dunham,

496
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:31,860
dude,
how bad asses that guy.

497
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,160
And he got tagged in the first round,
the first round,

498
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,360
you know,
effort and was all over them.

499
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,560
And then Evan Dunham survived and pulled
off that.

500
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:45,270
That fucking Armbar was so bad ass.
The way did,

501
00:27:45,271 --> 00:27:46,770
it was like,
it was so wicked.

502
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,330
Did he break his arm at all?
Uh,

503
00:27:48,331 --> 00:27:49,650
no.
He did not break his arm.

504
00:27:49,651 --> 00:27:53,280
He fucked up his tendons.
So lucky for him.

505
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,800
It was a.
The problem is man,

506
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:56,710
if it breaks,
if that.

507
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,160
The way that armbar happened,
see how his arm,

508
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:02,370
like he was bending it completely at the
joint is scary.

509
00:28:02,371 --> 00:28:06,450
Kindness the way Frank Mir broke tim his
arm because he actually broke the middle

510
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:08,490
of the forearm.
He broke the forum and half.

511
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:12,690
That's the scary shit that takes forever
to heal and it's usually not the same.

512
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,670
They're like,
I don't think you know.

513
00:28:14,671 --> 00:28:16,620
I think you break your arm like that,
man.

514
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,070
That's a serious fucking fracture.
Like in the middle.

515
00:28:20,071 --> 00:28:25,071
I think if you bust up a joint,
they get put that together a little bit 

516
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:28,521
easier.
Take arms and now by now you like metal 

517
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:30,360
arms or bones or something,
but I don't think they can.

518
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,870
I think they,
they do hips and they do knees,

519
00:28:33,871 --> 00:28:37,230
but once you get a knee that's a wrap.
You ain't doing no Jujitsu.

520
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,480
Well,
this dude named connor,

521
00:28:39,481 --> 00:28:42,450
connor human,
he's a one of Eddie's top students,

522
00:28:42,451 --> 00:28:47,451
a real high level wrestler and his dad 
was a wrestler and his dad got a hip 

523
00:28:47,451 --> 00:28:52,401
replacement and his dad still does do 
Jujitsu and fighting tournament and the 

524
00:28:52,401 --> 00:28:54,030
dude's like 50.
It's incredible,

525
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,560
you know,
but he has a hip replacement,

526
00:28:55,561 --> 00:28:57,390
but he's a fucking psycho and he's a 
stud.

527
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,130
You know the,
the average person,

528
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,290
you get a hip replacement and that's a 
wrap.

529
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,240
You know?
Remember that dude from the Sopranos,

530
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,910
he used to walk fucked up.
The Fat Guy who turned out,

531
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,770
you know he's gay and the and the 
Sopranos.

532
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,110
And he had that weird walk.
Do you remember that guy?

533
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,860
What was his name?
I don't remember that Kai's character.

534
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,560
I can't remember.
Something killed him.

535
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,060
Remember?
He was gay.

536
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:24,950
They murdered him.
I think they jumped like a fucking a 

537
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,550
broomstick up his ass or a hundred 
member pool.

538
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,050
Cue up his ass.
That's right.

539
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,720
Because he was selling a line of pool 
cues.

540
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,480
After that,
the dude tried to sell a,

541
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:36,840
a pool cues acute to die for the bottom 
break.

542
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,600
It was like a brake stick.
That's ridiculous,

543
00:29:39,601 --> 00:29:43,210
but Sopranos told him to knock it off.
How hilarious is that as a dude?

544
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,820
Some marketing sense got killed.
A pool cue.

545
00:29:45,821 --> 00:29:50,821
I'll show them those motherfuckers on 
the qs sales pool cues because they 

546
00:29:50,821 --> 00:29:53,110
killed them with one of the Sopranos.
Greatest show of all time.

547
00:29:53,111 --> 00:29:53,930
Right?
Oh,

548
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,620
I miss it.
Got Slower near the end,

549
00:29:56,621 --> 00:29:57,500
but I still miss.
I,

550
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:57,930
you know,
I,

551
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,070
I got into Battlestar Galactica for 
awhile.

552
00:30:00,071 --> 00:30:03,250
I like that up until the last season,
but the last season I just didn't give a

553
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:08,251
shit about.
Last is the only thing that really got 

554
00:30:08,251 --> 00:30:08,560
me.
Like this season I'm still really pumped

555
00:30:08,561 --> 00:30:11,260
up to see what the fuck is going on 
because I watched last.

556
00:30:11,261 --> 00:30:16,261
I didn't watch it at all for like the 
first whatever seasons there were the 

557
00:30:16,261 --> 00:30:16,420
first three or four seasons or whatever 
it is.

558
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,750
How many seasons have they done?
Have they really?

559
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,600
Well,
I watched all of them from the beginning

560
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,730
to the end.
All of them on DVD,

561
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:29,820
which is the shit if you've,
if you've managed to avoid like Ari did 

562
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:29,820
that with the Sopranos.

563
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:34,950
He didn't leave his fucking house,
our estate home for like weeks and just 

564
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:37,300
watched the Sopranos Dvds watched the 
whole series to the end.

565
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,650
Have you ever done that?
No.

566
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:41,470
Only with lost,
but I caught up to.

567
00:30:41,471 --> 00:30:43,480
They're the ones that were on the Dvr 
last year.

568
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,270
I did like the first three seasons,
the sopranos that way.

569
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,850
Oh yeah.
Seasons of Dexter.

570
00:30:48,851 --> 00:30:50,890
I did that way to whole first season.
It's the way,

571
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,430
but there's another one out.
Last year I was like,

572
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,630
Eh,
this year,

573
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,410
this year rather,
as soon as I started watching,

574
00:30:56,411 --> 00:30:56,960
I was like,
Eh,

575
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,770
I'm not in this anymore.
Or some dude killing people.

576
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,110
After awhile I'm like,
okay,

577
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:07,190
where are we going to go with this?
You know you're going to keep getting 

578
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,661
away with this.
I'm Kinda keeps saying you kill the bad 

579
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:09,661
guy every week.
Grayling,

580
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:11,230
come on man.
This is silly.

581
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,030
Did you see that break dancing robot?

582
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,540
Yes.
How awesome that.

583
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,170
How about that fuck robot they created.
You see that?

584
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,570
That's gross.
You see Jimmy Kimmel last night?

585
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:20,410
No,
I didn't say that.

586
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,810
He was dressed up as Jane line and I 
heard it was hilarious.

587
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,850
They were talking about the mystery 
here.

588
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,280
I'll say right now,
I wouldn't see this.

589
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,570
Jimmy Kimmel dressed up as a,
as Leno,

590
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,070
the fucking wars,
the war,

591
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,510
the war for late night.
Listen,

592
00:31:34,511 --> 00:31:35,230
fuck.
Late night.

593
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,690
The Internet is where it's at.
Ladies and gentlemen,

594
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,610
this is the real connection to human 
beings.

595
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,240
These silly shows where you sit down and
you know,

596
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:45,250
ask some fucking 16 year old kid what 
are new CD is,

597
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:46,450
you know,
hey,

598
00:31:46,451 --> 00:31:48,350
sign is standing.
You got a new shell out.

599
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,230
Oh,
that's terrific.

600
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:53,800
Who gives a fuck about all that stuff?
It's just you're just under the other.

601
00:31:53,801 --> 00:31:55,600
There's just people in their pimp and 
things.

602
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:00,780
People pimp and movies and occasionally 
someone gives their dick sucked by some 

603
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,981
crazy cooker or something like that.
Hugh grant interview and you'd get an 

604
00:32:04,981 --> 00:32:05,540
interesting interview or the other dude 
that the,

605
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,510
the,
the,

606
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,230
the.
What's his name?

607
00:32:08,231 --> 00:32:10,840
Joaquin Phoenix that showed up.
All fucked up.

608
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,710
What happened in him?
Is He still fucking crazy?

609
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:17,730
I Dunno,
but Letterman is the best for taking 

610
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:18,820
advantage of those situations.
And Joaquin Phoenix either was playing a

611
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:23,821
character,
you might've been just doing it for a 

612
00:32:23,821 --> 00:32:23,821
goof,
you know,

613
00:32:23,821 --> 00:32:24,370
I could see him doing something or 
saying it's real.

614
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,070
There's just gone,
completely gone.

615
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:33,270
It's not hard to do if you're a person 
who wanted to be famous and you know,

616
00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:35,820
your whole life you've wanted to be 
famous and you've had,

617
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,620
you have this need,
this hyper need for attention.

618
00:32:38,621 --> 00:32:41,090
And then all of a it happens to like,
Holy Shit,

619
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:46,330
you know,
I'm lucky that the kind of fame that I 

620
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:46,330
got like always was.

621
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:49,460
Especially the fear factor thing was 
like ridiculous fame,

622
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:54,700
you know,
like no one's kissing your ass for fear 

623
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:54,700
factor.
You know,

624
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:54,700
when people come up to you for fear 
factor,

625
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,940
like what the fuck dude?
And I'm a.

626
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:56,720
and I was like,
yeah,

627
00:32:56,721 --> 00:32:59,540
I know what the fuck.
But it's not like they love,

628
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,600
you know,
like if you're like an actor or 

629
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:04,600
something like that and you're in some 
crazy movies,

630
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,140
like that guy is the kind of adulation 
that guy must get.

631
00:33:06,141 --> 00:33:08,390
It's insane.
You know?

632
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,450
And if he was already crazy to begin 
with that just when,

633
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,100
when crazy people all of a sudden have 
money and people kissing their ass,

634
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:21,280
you know,
crazy people are supposed to be like 

635
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:21,280
suppressed.
Like you split the crazy people.

636
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:21,570
You supposed to see them and go,
hey fuck head,

637
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:26,580
you're crazy.
But that doesn't work like on the TV 

638
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,530
show or a movie.
Because once you become crazy,

639
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,320
it doesn't matter if you're a star,
they let you be crazy.

640
00:33:30,321 --> 00:33:35,321
So you're just plucking hog wild and 
doing blow and punching people and they 

641
00:33:35,321 --> 00:33:39,671
try to protect you as much as possible 
because you're the goose that lays the 

642
00:33:39,671 --> 00:33:42,971
golden egg.
And that's what happens to a lot of 

643
00:33:42,971 --> 00:33:42,971
actors.
That's where they get fucking nutty.

644
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,440
So where's this video here?
Wait,

645
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:46,310
Jay Leno.
Okay.

646
00:33:46,311 --> 00:33:51,311
This is a Jimmy Kimmel from last night.
I guess he was making fun of Jay Leno 

647
00:33:51,311 --> 00:33:51,720
with you.
Megan find it.

648
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,560
He even did that.
Joe It.

649
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,830
And they can hear us too.
While this was planned.

650
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:22,230
I got to watch it over here because this
stupid things on how much the delay is 

651
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,760
video and video is tight.
Sir.

652
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,510
You are correct.
Chance sparks.

653
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,160
Oh Wow.
This is from.

654
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:33,610
He's got makeup on and everything.
All my guy,

655
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,370
he's the backs in my opinion.

656
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,910
Me knowing that I'm taking over all the 
shows and late night

657
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:49,910
music.

658
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:55,110
Great to be here on thing.
Always bumped Conan NBC today that said 

659
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:13,980
I won't participate in the destruction 
of the tonight show.

660
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,550
Fortunately though,
I will.

661
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,860
Jimmy Kimmel tonight.
He's gone.

662
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:30,310
Don't worry,
it'll be fine.

663
00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:32,950
Or he picked up an endorsement.
Deal with Jenny Craig

664
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,520
here.
And then here's him,

665
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,950
uh,
with uh,

666
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,760
Chevy Chase.
Uh,

667
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:42,910
let's,
let's,

668
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,100
let's,
let's talk to people.

669
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:45,380
What I'm going to keep playing.

670
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,370
What is this one from headlines

671
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,680
really lame.

672
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:59,640
Find a headline from the paper and then 
we present them to you,

673
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,960
the viewer.
And uh,

674
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,280
our first headline,

675
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:03,570
that's the list.

676
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,200
Vehicles may end drunk and driving.
And cigarettes.

677
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,190
Man,
lung cancer.

678
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:27,160
I should show you this one.
Here we go.

679
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,740
A service worker.
What are they usually hire?

680
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,240
Robots.
Service workers.

681
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:39,810
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

682
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,350
Murdering medic.

683
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:52,660
What is the repair of your tornado?
What got you into trouble in the first 

684
00:36:53,431 --> 00:36:53,670
place

685
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,880
that's real.
Oh my God,

686
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,230
a Maltese and beautiful slowly,
very,

687
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:18,020
very slowly after the famous pilot 
flowing flowing burger.

688
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,340
Wow.
That was brutal.

689
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:32,510
We're on like a 15 second delay is that 
in case we commit suicide and it's just 

690
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:38,390
probably what I'm doing over here.
It takes like 15 seconds to see what's 

691
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:42,831
happening over there.
So if like you're watching someone in 

692
00:37:42,831 --> 00:37:43,780
the video and a werewolf is like 
standing over there,

693
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:49,430
by the time you see that,
that motherfucker's dead where we'll 

694
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:56,780
fuck that dude.
A long time ago was a big ass delay 

695
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:56,780
here.
I wonder if like,

696
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:02,030
you know there's someone watching all 
the controversial ustream ones and they 

697
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,481
don't have a delay and they're like 
right there with a finger on the button 

698
00:38:05,481 --> 00:38:06,500
if you do something nutty because then 
the guy commit suicide on,

699
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:11,520
on a web web show.
A guy committed to kill themselves all 

700
00:38:12,871 --> 00:38:15,300
the time.
Now at least two people I think.

701
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:18,450
Well that's not all the time.
That's a big,

702
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:21,230
you know,
when the community is not,

703
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,440
you know,
we've got to do man.

704
00:38:22,441 --> 00:38:27,441
We gotta do headphones.
That way we could listen to ourselves 

705
00:38:27,441 --> 00:38:29,850
and make sure that the sound is good and
now I'm watching them now what happened?

706
00:38:29,851 --> 00:38:31,160
Watching meters.
Yeah.

707
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,840
Crazy motherfucker.
I'm glad we got this microphone to.

708
00:38:33,841 --> 00:38:34,980
This is the perfect microphone,
right?

709
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:40,350
Because it picks up everything.
You could probably press pause and then 

710
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,270
refresh your browser if you want to 
catch up.

711
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:43,850
Really?
You think so?

712
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,430
Oh,
you're right.

713
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,370
You motherfucker

714
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:52,450
the Mar Gaydon wow.
That's,

715
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,980
that's more kate.
And do you know more cadence?

716
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,280
It's one of the best comics ever.
I don't think it's real anymore.

717
00:38:58,281 --> 00:38:59,520
Come on man.
That's him,

718
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,580
dude.
He's been saying some crazy shit.

719
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,970
He's one of England's pride.
The pride of England.

720
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,760
He's pretty funny.
He's not as funny.

721
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,050
Well,
funny looking.

722
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:12,860
He's um,
you don't think he's a genius?

723
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:15,890
You don't get it.
You don't get the material.

724
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,180
I just think that,
uh,

725
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,510
I can't understand a word he says.

726
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:21,880
Hey.
Uh Oh.

727
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:23,750
It looks like this guy.
David Galloway.

728
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:28,820
G O e w e y says I'm up at 3:48
AM in Abu Dhabi.

729
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,190
Now answer some questions.
Joe Will.

730
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:31,710
Fuck.
Yeah,

731
00:39:31,711 --> 00:39:33,390
dude,
I'll ask you some questions.

732
00:39:33,391 --> 00:39:38,391
You're up at 4:00
in the morning and you live in Abu 

733
00:39:38,391 --> 00:39:38,391
Dhabi.
I got two questions for you sir.

734
00:39:38,391 --> 00:39:39,000
What's it like over there?
Man?

735
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,090
I hear this all like fucking everybody's
got a Ferrari.

736
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,700
It's like one of the richest places in 
the world.

737
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,280
I've heard it's fucking crazy.
Is that true?

738
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:52,400
So recitation real legal there.
I don't think prostitution is but I 

739
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:52,920
think if you're like,
you know,

740
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:56,670
some sort of a ball or character.
I mean I think they just ignore it.

741
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:01,720
I mean the way it happens in Dubai,
it is like all the hookers just go 

742
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,200
there.
They just know all the rich guys are the

743
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:07,220
rich guys go to Dubai.
So hookers was coming from everywhere 

744
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:07,220
and I think they just ignore it,
you know?

745
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,540
I don't know though.
I don't think it's legal.

746
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:10,200
Is there any questions on your message 
board?

747
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:15,201
But I don't,
I've never been either will go to the 

748
00:40:15,201 --> 00:40:15,201
message board shortly,
but I want to hit.

749
00:40:15,201 --> 00:40:16,140
I want to see what this guy has to say.
It is sweet.

750
00:40:16,141 --> 00:40:18,200
And he says,
David Wood.

751
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,860
David,
you just chilling in Abu Dhabi.

752
00:40:19,861 --> 00:40:20,820
What do you do out there,
man?

753
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:23,280
What do you do for a living in Abu 
Dhabi?

754
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,160
Do you have a Ferrari?
Do they give you one?

755
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,360
You get your driver's license.
They'd hit you.

756
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:33,820
Do you like the yellow or the red?
You can get a black one too.

757
00:40:33,821 --> 00:40:34,600
If you know somebody

758
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,260
do do,
do,

759
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:40,850
do.

760
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,650
Alright.
I'm going to go to some questions here.

761
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:56,900
Let's do two girls,
one cup video in video that kind of 

762
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:56,900
says,
yeah,

763
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,200
I was thinking about.
Has Anybody not seen two girls?

764
00:40:58,201 --> 00:41:03,201
One Cup though?
I was really going to shoot a horse 

765
00:41:03,201 --> 00:41:03,201
wine.
Oh,

766
00:41:03,201 --> 00:41:04,150
you guys want to see Mr Han's.
We can't do that.

767
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,820
We can't do that.
That was upbeat.

768
00:41:05,821 --> 00:41:08,630
US broadcasting of ABC.
Okay,

769
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,780
but then we can't show the shitty thing 
either.

770
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:15,790
Can we not?
We can't do anything like that can be 

771
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:15,790
automatically banned.
All right.

772
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:15,790
Listen folks,

773
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,790
this is going to.
We're going to do this for a little bit,

774
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:22,791
but eventually we're going to move over 
to my website so I could show you guys 

775
00:41:22,791 --> 00:41:23,610
getting fucked.
Death by horses and people eat shit.

776
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:29,080
I did not know that.
I was not able to show those types of 

777
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:29,520
videos.
Well this is not going to last.

778
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,680
They let us say whatever they want,
whatever we want,

779
00:41:31,681 --> 00:41:34,010
but we can't show you whatever we want,
which I don't think is

780
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,160
going to be any of the stream websites.
You won't be able to like,

781
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,960
well,
we're going to have to either talk to 

782
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:41,960
you stream and see if we can say yes to 
that.

783
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,250
No,
no one will.

784
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:48,330
Yeah.
Because even if you say like if you 

785
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:48,330
click on something saying that you are 
18 and over,

786
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:48,330
we don't have that.
Now do we?

787
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:52,840
Do we have that now where they have to 
click on something that says there are 

788
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:52,840
18 and over.
We should have that.

789
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,500
I think that's possible.
People probably put it on there.

790
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,820
Well,
there's definitely do that.

791
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,740
I don't want any little kids getting a 
shitty ideas.

792
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,190
I don't want to have to explain anything
to.

793
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,640
It's not that I'm telling you anything 
that's not correct.

794
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:05,390
It's just that I don't want to have to 
sit down with you and go over the way.

795
00:42:05,391 --> 00:42:06,320
The world really works.

796
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:11,320
It's too much work with this guy says 
Alexander wrote says he heard this 

797
00:42:12,711 --> 00:42:15,430
Ferrari's just abandoned in the street.
That's what I'm talking about,

798
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,420
man.
Motherfuckers got money.

799
00:42:17,421 --> 00:42:20,840
It's like,
what does that 2007 just piano throw the

800
00:42:20,841 --> 00:42:25,841
keys inside the.
They give them away to goodwill and 

801
00:42:25,841 --> 00:42:28,710
raise her phones everywhere.
You're mowing the lawn and there's razor

802
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,510
phones.
Just finding out hitting.

803
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,710
I think they have lungs,
man.

804
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,720
Our guys are.
I would like to see.

805
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,280
Maybe they do.
Maybe they turned into.

806
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:38,720
Well,
I think they're going to have an outdoor

807
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:41,000
fight.
They're really exploring the place.

808
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:46,001
That's really scary.
The Middle East is in a strange land 

809
00:42:46,001 --> 00:42:46,760
man.
It's a strange land.

810
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,620
Very different.
Yeah.

811
00:42:48,621 --> 00:42:51,020
For the people that want to see Mr 
Hanson and want to know what I'm talking

812
00:42:51,021 --> 00:42:53,360
about.
Go to a two guys.

813
00:42:53,361 --> 00:42:56,090
One horse,
one.com.

814
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,010
Two guys.
One horse.com

815
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:03,070
is the video that I wanted to show you,
but I can't because you stream or a 

816
00:43:03,651 --> 00:43:04,520
bunch of pussies.

817
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,990
I guess they want to make money.
You don't want to pee.

818
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,890
Advertisers pull it out like they do 
with tiger woods.

819
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,730
Pour for poor tiger was a fella I,
uh,

820
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,550
went to the airport and they still have 
his posters up for accenture,

821
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:19,730
one of the first companies that dropped 
him and one of the posters,

822
00:43:19,731 --> 00:43:21,330
it's tiger looking like,
you know,

823
00:43:21,331 --> 00:43:24,680
contemplating a shot and it says 
something like,

824
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,720
it's what you do next.
That counts.

825
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,570
Put it up on my twitter page.
I'm like,

826
00:43:29,571 --> 00:43:31,490
man,
how fucking telling is that?

827
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:36,790
Did he ever have a fucking inkling of a 
clue that that's what was gonna happen 

828
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,840
when he put that picture out?
And people are like,

829
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:40,700
people freak out about the tiger woods 
thing like that.

830
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,170
He's a terrible person.
And he said,

831
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,890
yes,
it's not the best thing to do.

832
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,810
I agree.
But that guy is an,

833
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:49,490
an handsome.

834
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:53,840
He's an unfortunate looking guy.
He's very unfortunate looking and he's a

835
00:43:53,841 --> 00:43:56,180
fucking billionaire.
He's got super,

836
00:43:56,181 --> 00:44:01,181
super rich dude.
I bet it was impossible for him to say 

837
00:44:01,181 --> 00:44:02,690
no dollars checks,
you know?

838
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,380
I mean,
if you think,

839
00:44:03,381 --> 00:44:08,381
I mean obviously it was a pussy hound.
I mean there's no getting away from 

840
00:44:08,381 --> 00:44:11,651
that.
But to be like that guy you know and 

841
00:44:11,651 --> 00:44:15,320
have all these tens and they're chasing 
you down and they don't even care if 

842
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,910
you're married and they'll fly to other 
countries to hang out with you.

843
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,130
Holy Shit.
You know,

844
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:24,490
it's like a rock star.
He's totally like a rock star and it 

845
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,380
will then you shouldn't be married.
I totally agree.

846
00:44:27,381 --> 00:44:30,010
I'm not defending him in any way.
He's more of a rockstar.

847
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,040
Most rock stars don't have own beverage.
Then

848
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,310
they'll have their own clothing line.
That dude,

849
00:44:34,311 --> 00:44:38,190
it's fucking crazy.
People love that stupid ass game.

850
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,580
They love it.
Especially business people.

851
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,440
If you want to get down to business,
you know,

852
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:47,070
I've heard a lot of people say that if 
you want to be successful in business,

853
00:44:47,071 --> 00:44:50,490
that you literally have to learn golf.
Like you literally have to learn it.

854
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:52,160
If you don't learn golf,
that he hit refresh

855
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,620
screen,
show you so you can see why it sat.

856
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:02,110
What's going on?
It's gone on inside.

857
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:07,340
Just a picture.
That picture you're talking about tiger 

858
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:07,340
woods.
Oh,

859
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,660
what's wrong with this then?
I don't know.

860
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,020
I mean,
when you stream,

861
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:13,610
you're sucking it dummies.
I would close your firearm

862
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:18,320
and open up like in safari or chrome,
maybe have twins.

863
00:45:18,321 --> 00:45:18,820
Shit Open.

864
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:20,140
No,
there it goes.

865
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,810
It's usually the pictures up filing.
See,

866
00:45:22,811 --> 00:45:25,150
that's much much of a delay.
So like I said,

867
00:45:25,151 --> 00:45:27,340
if you see a werewolf behind me and you 
hear that,

868
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,620
believe me,
I'm already dead.

869
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:35,010
Okay.
Just be kind to be on the message 

870
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:35,770
boards.
People are brutal about Artie Lange.

871
00:45:35,771 --> 00:45:40,771
Man.
That was really sad to see how many 

872
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:41,470
people were brutal after already laying 
tried to commit suicide.

873
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,360
Like calling them people just like that 
suicide shit.

874
00:45:44,361 --> 00:45:45,250
All right.
I know,

875
00:45:45,251 --> 00:45:47,440
but it wasn't just that.
It was,

876
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:48,620
it was.
There were,

877
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,770
there were insulting him.
Like it didn't matter.

878
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,290
You know,
you know that he's weak and he's a piece

879
00:45:53,291 --> 00:45:58,291
of shit.
Like I said about where it talked about 

880
00:45:58,291 --> 00:45:59,170
the people that I know that have had 
problems with pain pills.

881
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:00,730
It's not like,
you know,

882
00:46:00,731 --> 00:46:02,620
the guy likes to jerk off,
he jerks off.

883
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:03,520
Two months later,
that guy.

884
00:46:03,521 --> 00:46:04,620
You need to smack him in the head and 
go,

885
00:46:04,621 --> 00:46:09,621
what the fuck is wrong with you?
You lost your job because you jerk off 

886
00:46:09,621 --> 00:46:09,621
five times a day.
You know there's dudes like that.

887
00:46:09,621 --> 00:46:10,510
They're like,
dear ms.jobs.

888
00:46:10,511 --> 00:46:10,830
They,
they,

889
00:46:10,831 --> 00:46:13,810
they show up late for work just because 
they're like chronic masturbator.

890
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,460
They wake up in the morning,
they have to beat off.

891
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:16,930
They don't beat off.
They're going to go crazy.

892
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,660
Like they get that.
That's a dude that's got a problem.

893
00:46:19,661 --> 00:46:21,640
That guy's his.
He needs a smack in the head.

894
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:24,430
People that are like,
like compulsive gamblers.

895
00:46:24,431 --> 00:46:26,290
That's a compulsion and that's there 
though.

896
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,690
There's a problem and your pattern of 
thinking,

897
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:30,620
there's a problem in the way,
you know,

898
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:33,310
and I've been compulsive about many 
things in my life.

899
00:46:33,311 --> 00:46:35,620
I understand what it is,
I understand the thinking behind it,

900
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,090
but that could all be corrected.

901
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,740
You just need to learn how to think 
correctly.

902
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:43,920
There's a big difference between that 
and like heroin and Oxycontin and math 

903
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,270
and people who get addicted to shit.
That shit's real.

904
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,740
That's real.
You know?

905
00:46:47,741 --> 00:46:52,741
So to get to shit all over someone 
because they're addicted to a drug man,

906
00:46:53,201 --> 00:46:55,000
it ain't easy to kick that.
You don't,

907
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,160
you know,
unless you're doing it,

908
00:46:57,161 --> 00:46:58,930
unless you're deep in the throes of 
heroin,

909
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,420
you can't talk shit.
And if you have been,

910
00:47:01,421 --> 00:47:03,520
and I haven't,
so I can say nothing,

911
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:06,360
but I've talked to people who have.
I had a friend who,

912
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:11,410
who died from heroin.
I knew a couple people that die from 

913
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:11,410
heroin.
And uh,

914
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:13,330
the one that I knew he was,
he was a real,

915
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,500
real smart guy.
He was,

916
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,840
he was a cool dude.
He just couldn't stop it.

917
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:18,460
I don't know.
I don't.

918
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:22,480
I think some people bond to those 
dangerous drugs and you're fucked.

919
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:28,050
So whatever happened with him already 
laying was every time I met that guy,

920
00:47:28,171 --> 00:47:30,910
he's always been cool to.
And that's how I judge people.

921
00:47:30,911 --> 00:47:32,770
He's always fun to be around,
friendly,

922
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,440
jovial,
and he's,

923
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:37,300
I think he's hilarious.
He's just a,

924
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,840
he's a nice guy,
you know,

925
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:43,890
and to me it just made me sad.
It made me just the sound of the people 

926
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:45,180
were willing to shit on this guy because
he tried to kill himself,

927
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:50,750
but you are right.
People get mad when people try to kill 

928
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:50,750
themselves,
you know,

929
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:51,010
especially when people have a much 
better life than them.

930
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,330
You know?
I mean,

931
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:57,331
that was the argument that I heard over 
and over again about already like this 

932
00:47:57,331 --> 00:47:57,331
fucking guy.
You know,

933
00:47:57,331 --> 00:48:01,620
what are his problems?
He's got a Mercedes and you know he's 

934
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,070
rich and all true,
but that doesn't make you feel better.

935
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,800
Unfortunately you'd think it would,
but it doesn't.

936
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:11,040
If your life sucks,
your life sucks and it really has 

937
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:11,040
nothing to do with you.
Being rich or poor.

938
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,080
Rich can definitely help things because 
you don't have to worry about your bills

939
00:48:14,081 --> 00:48:16,450
and you have less problems.
You have a little bit less stress,

940
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:21,690
but then you've got problems with your 
money and investments and people 

941
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:21,690
stealing from you and bullshit.
You know,

942
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:21,970
you.
Yeah,

943
00:48:21,971 --> 00:48:25,060
you have problems all over the place.
Definitely better to have it than not,

944
00:48:25,061 --> 00:48:30,061
but the bottom line is just because 
you're successful doesn't mean you're 

945
00:48:30,061 --> 00:48:30,580
happy.
There's a lot of people that are fucking

946
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,560
horribly hard,
horribly depressed,

947
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:34,090
and they sit around thinking,
well,

948
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:35,770
what the fuck is the purpose of his 
life?

949
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,320
You know,
and the real problem is,

950
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:43,350
that's a good goddamn question.
What is the purpose of this life if 

951
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:44,860
you're not here for other people,
what are you here for?

952
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,230
Because realistically,
you know,

953
00:48:47,231 --> 00:48:52,231
you get to a certain point in your life 
like already and I are basically the 

954
00:48:52,231 --> 00:48:52,960
same age.
I'm 42 and I believe he is too.

955
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:54,850
And you know,
you get to a point where you're like,

956
00:48:54,851 --> 00:48:58,870
you get all this gray like have gray 
hair and my beard and on my balls I have

957
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:01,630
like 20 gray hairs.
So gray hairs coming in here.

958
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:02,780
I mean this is like,
you know,

959
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,890
your body's dying.
So at a certain point in time you got to

960
00:49:05,891 --> 00:49:10,891
go,
what the fuck is the purpose of all 

961
00:49:10,891 --> 00:49:10,891
this?
What am I here for?

962
00:49:10,891 --> 00:49:13,750
You know,
and if you don't have like a 

963
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:13,750
relationship,
you don't have someone you love,

964
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:14,650
you don't have really good friends that 
you love and you love to be around.

965
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:16,330
You don't have a family,
you don't have children,

966
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:21,540
you don't have someone that that you 
mean something to someone that you feed 

967
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:26,221
off of each other and you share energy 
and you make them feel good and they 

968
00:49:26,221 --> 00:49:26,221
make you feel good.

969
00:49:26,221 --> 00:49:26,710
You know they miss you and you miss 
them,

970
00:49:26,711 --> 00:49:27,850
and that's very,
very,

971
00:49:27,851 --> 00:49:32,851
very,
very important for people and people 

972
00:49:32,851 --> 00:49:32,851
just underestimate how huge that is.
You know,

973
00:49:32,851 --> 00:49:37,771
having friends and having family and 
having good quality people in your life 

974
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:41,680
and not douchebags cut the Douche bags 
out.

975
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:46,830
That is so important because nothing can
fuck your life up more than people who 

976
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:52,440
are not looking out for your best 
interest and want you to fail because 

977
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:52,440
they're fucked up.
You know?

978
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,480
Try to let them aware it,
let them be aware of it,

979
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:59,530
give them an opportunity to change and 
if they don't get rid of a condom out of

980
00:49:59,531 --> 00:50:01,120
your life.
So important,

981
00:50:01,121 --> 00:50:03,880
just separate yourself from anybody 
negative that's going to fuck with you.

982
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:07,150
That can make such a huge difference in 
the quality of your life.

983
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:08,920
You know?
And then of course,

984
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:10,330
get the fuck away from drugs.

985
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:12,640
The bad ones,
don't fuck around with heroin.

986
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:17,680
Don't fuck around with math.
Don't fuck around with anything 

987
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:17,680
dangerous.
If you're going to do something,

988
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,750
do,
do things that people have never died 

989
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:23,971
from,
and make sure you know what the fuck 

990
00:50:23,971 --> 00:50:23,971
you're doing before you do it.
You know,

991
00:50:23,971 --> 00:50:27,421
don't go crazy and smoke the whole joint
the first time you know you shit your 

992
00:50:27,421 --> 00:50:28,040
pants and paranoia.
You freaked the fuck out,

993
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:33,050
Yo.
You're probably never going to get high 

994
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:33,050
again.
The first time you ever get high and you

995
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:36,281
should just get a little tiny bit high.
Just a little tiny bit of a hit and get 

996
00:50:36,281 --> 00:50:37,110
used to it.
You know,

997
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,880
it's like riding a surfboard.
You can't just hop on.

998
00:50:40,881 --> 00:50:45,881
You'd be awesome at it.
No know the feeling of being caught up 

999
00:50:45,881 --> 00:50:48,470
in the wave of thc when,
when when you get really high,

1000
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,480
it's like you're connecting to like 
another,

1001
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:55,630
another frequency that it's not 
available to you when you're sober and 

1002
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:55,630
that's where people don't smoke 
marijuana.

1003
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:59,240
Don't understand.
There's an awareness and opening of your

1004
00:50:59,241 --> 00:51:04,241
mind,
and I've had explained to me chemically 

1005
00:51:04,241 --> 00:51:05,630
about Gaba and dopamine and all the 
different things that go on.

1006
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:10,670
There was a recent threat about it on my
message board where people are talking 

1007
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:12,080
about the effect of it,
but the bottom line is it does something

1008
00:51:12,081 --> 00:51:17,081
to the way you think and it opens up new
levels of awareness and if you get too 

1009
00:51:17,301 --> 00:51:19,370
much of that,
you're going to freak the fuck out,

1010
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:24,420
and that's called being paranoid.
But what paranoia comes from is this 

1011
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,580
probably the first time you're 
recognizing reality.

1012
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:28,010
You know you're a very vulnerable 
person.

1013
00:51:28,011 --> 00:51:30,860
We all our life is,
is you know,

1014
00:51:30,861 --> 00:51:32,630
it's a transient experience.
It's gonna.

1015
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:34,880
You're gonna pass from this to something
else.

1016
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:36,320
Maybe.
Who knows?

1017
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,360
Who knows what the fuck.
This is the first place.

1018
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:41,180
Who knows what the ultimate goal of 
human racist in the first place.

1019
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:45,950
You just live your life and go through 
it and you put your blinders on and when

1020
00:51:45,951 --> 00:51:50,420
you have a hit of some really good weed,
those blinders just fall down around you

1021
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:52,130
and you realize like,
wow,

1022
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:57,340
I'm this fragile,
fleshy little temporary being that's 

1023
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:02,050
plaguing to the spinning orb has it's 
flying through the galaxy and people are

1024
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:04,520
sitting around talking about John and 
Kate and,

1025
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:09,200
and,
and fucking Miley Cyrus and nonsense.

1026
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:13,790
And while this is all going on,
were hurling through the galaxy and then

1027
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:15,530
literally is never discussed.
You know,

1028
00:52:15,531 --> 00:52:17,600
and I have a bit about it.
You can see it on youtube.

1029
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:19,510
I think it's somebody put it up,
it's yours.

1030
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:20,600
It's from my,
uh,

1031
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:21,740
uh,
my,

1032
00:52:21,741 --> 00:52:23,690
uh,
shiny happy Jihad CD.

1033
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:26,210
It's about flying through space,
but that's where we are.

1034
00:52:26,211 --> 00:52:26,690
I mean,
we're,

1035
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:32,080
we're just,
we're just animals clinging to a sphere 

1036
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:36,560
in eternity in this gigantic sea of 
eternity,

1037
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:41,580
sea of space.
This never ending thing that we're a 

1038
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:42,260
part of,
but we completely ignore and we focus on

1039
00:52:42,261 --> 00:52:45,350
the most mundane bullshit.
Like Tiger Woods,

1040
00:52:45,351 --> 00:52:47,300
fucking all these girls,
you know.

1041
00:52:47,301 --> 00:52:50,210
And like what else,
what are the other dumb shit that people

1042
00:52:50,211 --> 00:52:51,950
have been focusing on lately in the 
news?

1043
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:57,740
I know,
I think why people focus on so much and 

1044
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:58,000
it's because you know,
they need something.

1045
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:00,430
It's like kind of watching the same 
movie over and over again.

1046
00:53:00,431 --> 00:53:05,431
You know,
you need constant new information and 

1047
00:53:05,431 --> 00:53:05,431
stuff like that,
you know,

1048
00:53:05,431 --> 00:53:07,270
like I understand what you're saying 
like about the whole thing.

1049
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:12,271
But uh,
I think that's why so many people 

1050
00:53:12,271 --> 00:53:12,820
focused on the dumb shit because the new
shit,

1051
00:53:12,821 --> 00:53:13,900
you know,
that same thing.

1052
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,100
Yeah,

1053
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:20,170
that's a good point.
So like what you're saying is that the 

1054
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:21,110
reason why people focus on like tiger 
woods and stuff like that,

1055
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:23,220
it's just because it's new information.
It doesn't matter.

1056
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:26,220
We've been in space for so long and 
nothing happens

1057
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,710
and you look up,
you see stars while Blah Blah,

1058
00:53:28,711 --> 00:53:31,380
shut the fuck up.
It's like same cell phone.

1059
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:33,300
What would you have the same stuff on 
for 10 years?

1060
00:53:33,301 --> 00:53:36,210
Or if tiger woods sell new cell phone 
came out,

1061
00:53:36,211 --> 00:53:37,480
would you get the tiger woods and stuff?

1062
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,600
That's a good point.
I think Brian's onto something.

1063
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:43,210
I think know,
I mean it makes sense because you know,

1064
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,380
people are,
we do,

1065
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:49,150
we have this push for new things and 
innovation and it's literally built into

1066
00:53:49,151 --> 00:53:51,580
our hard wiring,
which is why you can take a guy with the

1067
00:53:51,581 --> 00:53:54,070
hottest chick in the world and he 
doesn't want to fuck her anymore.

1068
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:59,180
So like you get,
you get tired of fucking the hottest 

1069
00:53:59,180 --> 00:53:59,180
chick in the world and that really is 
true.

1070
00:53:59,180 --> 00:53:59,180
You know that that can happen.
Yeah.

1071
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:04,290
If you look at life the wrong way and 
that's one of the other things that's 

1072
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:07,261
awesome about weed.
If you smoke weed and you fuck your 

1073
00:54:07,261 --> 00:54:07,261
girlfriend,
like if you,

1074
00:54:07,261 --> 00:54:09,490
if you don't usually do that,
it's like you're fucking a new person.

1075
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,630
It's like you appreciate are all for 
like who she is and what she,

1076
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:16,030
what she looks like.
You appreciate it all over again.

1077
00:54:16,031 --> 00:54:16,990
It's really weird,
man.

1078
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:22,020
At least for me.
Do you feel like that when you smoke 

1079
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,290
weed and get with your lady?
Yeah.

1080
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:26,170
When you smoke weed and get with your 
lady.

1081
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:28,600
My lady doesn't really smoke weed so 
it's not really that fun.

1082
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:33,930
Well,
mine can't right now because she's 

1083
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:33,930
pregnant with me.
Bambino.

1084
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:34,630
So have you played with the nexus one 
yet?

1085
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,070
No,
I have not.

1086
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:37,780
You're not a fan,
huh?

1087
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:39,130
Nah,
not really.

1088
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,470
Michael Tech Review Ladies.
Gentlemen to.

1089
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:48,130
The main problem is,
is if you have something like we both 

1090
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:50,200
have iphones and you have facebook and 
twitter and all these applications.

1091
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:55,540
Why I've had droid.
Why have an inferior version of facebook

1092
00:54:55,721 --> 00:54:57,880
on the droid sucks the twitter on the 
droids.

1093
00:54:58,030 --> 00:54:59,950
Not as good as twitter to,
you know,

1094
00:54:59,951 --> 00:55:03,670
everything is just the blackberry.
And I have uber,

1095
00:55:03,671 --> 00:55:05,320
twitter on it.
I use,

1096
00:55:05,321 --> 00:55:07,020
um,
I have an iphone but okay.

1097
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:07,340
I really

1098
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,620
use it more of,
as like a,

1099
00:55:09,621 --> 00:55:10,760
um,
like a,

1100
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:15,820
like a laptop that I keep in my pocket.
That's really what it is for me because 

1101
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:16,450
the bottom line with the iphone,
it's,

1102
00:55:16,451 --> 00:55:19,720
it's on a t and t and a t.
and t sucks when,

1103
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:24,750
when I'm talking to people on a t and t 
I can guarantee it's going to cut out 

1104
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:25,220
three or four times before I get 
wherever the fuck I'm going.

1105
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:30,400
When I drive in my car.
I love the fact that I can have both 

1106
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:30,830
hands on the steering wheel and I can 
just talk,

1107
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:32,960
you know,
and I'm having conversations and I can,

1108
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:37,980
you know,
do business and answer questions and 

1109
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:37,980
catch up with old friends that I don't 
have a chance to catch up with.

1110
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:38,510
I love that,
man.

1111
00:55:38,511 --> 00:55:40,160
That's been huge to me.
To me,

1112
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:42,770
that's one of the most important 
features of communication,

1113
00:55:42,771 --> 00:55:44,660
the ability to fucking talk to somebody.

1114
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:48,440
I don't like text messaging just back 
and forth after a while,

1115
00:55:48,441 --> 00:55:49,180
man.
You're like,

1116
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:51,140
I want to hear your fucking voice,
you know,

1117
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,940
that's,
that's the way I like talking to people.

1118
00:55:52,941 --> 00:55:53,600
You know,
it's fun.

1119
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,640
You know,
you can get things out of you,

1120
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:57,350
feed off of each other.
You know,

1121
00:55:57,351 --> 00:55:58,280
it's,
it's a volley,

1122
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:03,340
you're going back and forth.
So if your fucking phone can't make 

1123
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:03,340
phone calls,
that's weak.

1124
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:06,860
That's weak shit.
So I use a blackberry with verizon.

1125
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:09,680
No one's paying me to say this,
but the reason why I use the blackboard,

1126
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:15,700
because uh,
we do a UFC is in the UK and the only 

1127
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:15,700
way you could get a,
um,

1128
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:20,170
a phone that works overseas got to get a
world phone because we have two 

1129
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:23,561
different systems here in America.
We have CDMA and GSM and GSM is t mobile

1130
00:56:23,891 --> 00:56:28,891
and a t and t and a CBMA is sprint and 
verizon and there are two totally 

1131
00:56:28,891 --> 00:56:29,650
different types of signals.

1132
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:30,670
Well,
in other countries,

1133
00:56:30,671 --> 00:56:34,000
most other countries don't use the CDMA,
which verizon has,

1134
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,850
but it's the best in America and in 
America it's the shit.

1135
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:38,380
It's way better.
I mean,

1136
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:39,970
I,
when I drive to Jujitsu,

1137
00:56:39,971 --> 00:56:44,200
I would lose people three times with my,
at and t phone three fucking times would

1138
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:47,290
drive me crazy.
But my verizon was right there.

1139
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:50,140
That never drops off for a second.
It's so much better.

1140
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:52,810
But the bottom line is this shit is 
whack.

1141
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,680
This,
this,

1142
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:57,730
this phone is like an iphone from 20 
fucking years ago.

1143
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:00,190
That's what it's like.
It's like some,

1144
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,630
some cheap knock off,
you know,

1145
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,500
like some third world country,
you know,

1146
00:57:04,501 --> 00:57:06,940
where they make fake watches and shit 
like that.

1147
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,120
I try to summarize are pretty nice.
The flashes are pretty nice.

1148
00:57:10,121 --> 00:57:11,080
Yes.
Yes.

1149
00:57:11,081 --> 00:57:12,590
The cameras dope.
The uh,

1150
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,580
the flash is very good.
The video is excellent.

1151
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:17,860
Yes.
Reddit texting videos.

1152
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:20,200
Excellent.
Is Not bad to type on the uh,

1153
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:21,430
the typing.
This is the new one.

1154
00:57:21,431 --> 00:57:23,890
The storm to the double clicking is not 
bad.

1155
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:26,920
It's not just dropped in the toilet.
There's,

1156
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:31,970
this was right next to my pool,
but it's job while I was at the 9:30

1157
00:57:32,471 --> 00:57:34,540
club in Washington DC,
by the way.

1158
00:57:34,541 --> 00:57:36,120
I had a good fucking time down there in 
DC.

1159
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:41,130
People.
Thank you very much for your 

1160
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:41,130
hospitality.
Awesome.

1161
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:41,130
Awesome show.
I had a great time.

1162
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:42,340
But anyway,
I was at the 9:30

1163
00:57:42,341 --> 00:57:47,341
club this Friday night and I was pulling
my pre-performance Poopoo and uh,

1164
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:51,490
I got up and this phone because I was 
called a piece of shit committed,

1165
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:55,570
committed suicide and dove from my 
pocket into the shitty toilet.

1166
00:57:55,600 --> 00:58:00,600
It's like,
I'll show you a piece of shit is trying 

1167
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,611
to kill data.
I know what it's doing because it knows 

1168
00:58:02,611 --> 00:58:02,611
that I haven't backed up in a couple of 
weeks,

1169
00:58:02,611 --> 00:58:02,611
has tried to go.

1170
00:58:02,611 --> 00:58:05,470
I've got some cool pictures and videos 
on here and there's motherfuckers trying

1171
00:58:05,471 --> 00:58:06,970
to kill himself.
And uh,

1172
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,340
so I got it out and shook it and shook 
all the water out.

1173
00:58:09,341 --> 00:58:11,620
But I tried it with a hairdryer and the 
bitch came back.

1174
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:12,820
I mean it's,
it's,

1175
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:15,250
it's a great.
It's works tire.

1176
00:58:15,251 --> 00:58:18,130
Listen to your Shit Joe Rogan.
It's terribly for anything else.

1177
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:20,320
When you try to go on the Internet,
you want to shoot yourself,

1178
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:24,730
you try to use the twitter function on 
here it's so clunky and whack and typing

1179
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:27,400
is much.
It's okay to type like texts,

1180
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:32,490
but when you have to type in numbers you
have to like really constantly this 

1181
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:35,760
little tiny ass keyboard where the 
numbers are and you're always fucking 

1182
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:35,760
up.
Like when I have to give someone,

1183
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,650
if I'm answering an email and I have to 
give,

1184
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:39,280
give someone an address or a phone 
number,

1185
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:43,270
it takes five minutes because I barely 
can press down the three.

1186
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:44,920
I'm also,
I'm always getting the number right next

1187
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:45,280
to it.
It's,

1188
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:48,280
it's really weakened and knowing.
So the iphone is shit.

1189
00:58:48,281 --> 00:58:51,350
It's just so goddamn far above every 
else,

1190
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,460
every other phone out there.
It's not even close.

1191
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,690
If you're thinking about you want one 
phone,

1192
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,400
if you only had to choose between one 
phone,

1193
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:02,860
you got to go with the iphone.
But if you can afford to have two 

1194
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:05,161
phones,
the iphone is great for like a little 

1195
00:59:05,161 --> 00:59:07,111
computer to me it's shoes for pictures 
and twitters and applications and going 

1196
00:59:07,111 --> 00:59:12,011
on.
I'd probably wait until after the apple 

1197
00:59:12,011 --> 00:59:14,530
announcement in two weeks though,
is that there's a verizon iphone.

1198
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:17,260
If there's a verizon iphone,
I'll fucking jump for joy,

1199
00:59:17,261 --> 00:59:18,490
but I don't think there's going to be 
one.

1200
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:21,070
We think that the verizon thing,
what we've read online,

1201
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,810
because we're both Brian and I are both 
tech retards.

1202
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,850
The late verizon thing is,
uh,

1203
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,120
probably going to be some sort of a 
tablet,

1204
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:30,560
like a little,
like an internet,

1205
00:59:30,561 --> 00:59:35,561
like a kindle,
but you can get on the Internet with 

1206
00:59:35,561 --> 00:59:36,140
which would be kind of interesting,
like a,

1207
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:41,170
like a netbook with no keyboard or just 
an oversized iphone pretty much ever 

1208
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:41,990
heard or upgrade the gray.
Yeah,

1209
00:59:41,991 --> 00:59:44,750
he's that guy.
He's a guy from England that is a,

1210
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:49,220
a professor and a scientist who's 
working hard on a life extension.

1211
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:52,010
He's an interesting dude,
kind of A.

1212
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:57,010
I'm kind of a real eccentric character 
with crazy long beard and he's got all 

1213
00:59:58,041 --> 01:00:01,480
these really complex theories on how to 
extend the human lifetimes,

1214
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:04,580
like a thousand years.
But the only way you would die as if you

1215
01:00:04,581 --> 01:00:05,510
had a,
you know,

1216
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:08,210
like got an accident or something or 
sickness.

1217
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:12,040
Pretty Fascinating Shit.
The problem is if people live forever,

1218
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:13,550
there's not enough room for everybody.

1219
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:15,440
You know,
we're trying to fuck with nature.

1220
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:20,800
You know,
nature has us in a cycle and the cycle 

1221
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:21,710
is very simple.
Nobody lives more than like 120 years.

1222
01:00:21,711 --> 01:00:25,460
If you're the baddest motherfucker ever,
you live to be a buck 20 and then you're

1223
01:00:25,461 --> 01:00:30,461
done and the last few years you are a 
fragile mess and you better not go 

1224
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:34,721
anywhere.
You know you could tie your shoes and 

1225
01:00:34,721 --> 01:00:36,230
break your back in half.
You know you could fall down.

1226
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:41,410
You know when you're going to wipe your 
ass and head plant into the wall and be 

1227
01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:45,491
done.
Crack your neck paralyze shell over the 

1228
01:00:45,491 --> 01:00:45,491
floor.
I mean that could be the end.

1229
01:00:45,491 --> 01:00:50,310
It's going to be ugly.
You know you're going to be a human 

1230
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:50,310
role,
a tissue paper.

1231
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:51,980
That's what you're going to be.
So that's,

1232
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:53,600
that's the cycle of life.
You know,

1233
01:00:53,601 --> 01:00:55,310
and you have children and those 
children,

1234
01:00:55,610 --> 01:01:00,610
you,
you pass on your information and that's 

1235
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:00,610
what's supposed to happen.

1236
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:04,430
We are in the,
in the active process of evolving as a 

1237
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:08,261
species and there's two things that are 
going to aid that involvement or 

1238
01:01:08,261 --> 01:01:11,921
evolvement rather that evolution.
It's going to be either technology or 

1239
01:01:12,021 --> 01:01:15,050
it's going to be what we learn and what 
we pass on.

1240
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:19,520
And if you don't evolve,
and if you don't pass on something,

1241
01:01:19,521 --> 01:01:24,521
if your children don't evolve like this,
race can't exist from just the people 

1242
01:01:25,401 --> 01:01:28,190
that are alive now living forever.
Okay?

1243
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,060
Because people don't change that much.
They,

1244
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,000
they try,
they do their best.

1245
01:01:32,001 --> 01:01:37,001
But the amount of people that change 
over the amount of people that don't 

1246
01:01:37,001 --> 01:01:37,001
change,
I mean Shit,

1247
01:01:37,001 --> 01:01:38,690
how many people do you know that get 
their shit together,

1248
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:40,730
that have gotten their shit together?
They didn't have it.

1249
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:41,990
You know,
how many people do you know,

1250
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:44,990
not many.
Not that many.

1251
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:47,990
Most people who are a fucking mess stay 
a mess.

1252
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:53,230
And that's not good.
Those aren't good odds for a whole race 

1253
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:53,230
of humans.
You know,

1254
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:57,641
I think that the best bet for the human 
race that we're really care about it as 

1255
01:01:57,641 --> 01:01:57,680
a whole.
But we don't.

1256
01:01:57,890 --> 01:02:02,890
We care about ourselves because we're 
animals and because we have these 

1257
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:03,740
instincts in these instincts are 
designed to make sure that we stay alive

1258
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:09,010
and you know,
and that's just hard wiring even though 

1259
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:11,621
your,
your logic and your reason would 

1260
01:02:11,621 --> 01:02:11,621
dictate,
well,

1261
01:02:11,621 --> 01:02:14,771
Hey,
I'm only here for a temporary amount of 

1262
01:02:14,771 --> 01:02:16,181
time anyway.
I need to look at this like what is my 

1263
01:02:16,181 --> 01:02:16,181
purpose here?
What am I supposed to be doing?

1264
01:02:16,181 --> 01:02:20,680
And what you're supposed to be doing is 
making it better for the next people 

1265
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:23,710
will you to be doing is making it as 
good as you can for the people here and 

1266
01:02:23,710 --> 01:02:27,471
leaving an impression so that maybe you 
can enhance the minds and the open the 

1267
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:30,810
eyes and set the tone for the next 
people.

1268
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,610
You know,
if you meet a guy who's like,

1269
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,880
I mean every time I've ever met someone 
who's like really fucking cool and 

1270
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,611
really nice and really friendly,
it has always inspired me to be cooler 

1271
01:02:40,611 --> 01:02:41,970
and nicer and friendlier.
It's like,

1272
01:02:41,971 --> 01:02:45,450
it's so cool to meet people like that.
But you know,

1273
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:50,460
when I was growing up in Boston,
I knew a lot of fucking hard ass people.

1274
01:02:50,461 --> 01:02:55,461
I knew a lot of people that were just 
always ready to insult you and always 

1275
01:02:55,461 --> 01:02:59,721
wanted to fight and I knew a lot of.
And if you grow up around a lot of 

1276
01:02:59,721 --> 01:02:59,790
people like that,
you,

1277
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:04,850
you become like that.
Like it can make you like that you live 

1278
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:07,941
in that environment where everybody's 
kind of Douchey to each other on 

1279
01:03:07,941 --> 01:03:07,941
occasion,
you know,

1280
01:03:07,941 --> 01:03:11,660
like you go out to a bar in Boston,
your chances are you're going to see a 

1281
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:11,660
fight.

1282
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:12,600
You go to a nightclub and Boston to 
still throw down.

1283
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:13,770
I mean,
it's one of the few places,

1284
01:03:13,771 --> 01:03:18,771
like,
remember when we went to at least do 

1285
01:03:18,771 --> 01:03:18,771
the,
the,

1286
01:03:18,771 --> 01:03:20,621
um,
common connection and faneuil hall and 

1287
01:03:20,621 --> 01:03:20,621
after the show at like 2:00
in the morning,

1288
01:03:20,621 --> 01:03:22,860
that fucking place would be alive in the
summertime.

1289
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:25,410
It was crackling.
It was crackling.

1290
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:30,270
Like at any moment you could see a 
fucking brawl breakout where dudes punch

1291
01:03:30,271 --> 01:03:32,940
somebody and fucking tables would start 
flying.

1292
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,560
I mean,
it was a crazy place.

1293
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,290
I would hate to look at.
Yeah,

1294
01:03:36,291 --> 01:03:37,160
I mean we,
I'm going to fight,

1295
01:03:37,161 --> 01:03:42,161
so we see them,
we saw so many fights and so many close 

1296
01:03:42,161 --> 01:03:44,621
fights.
Me and Ram has got in a fight at 

1297
01:03:44,621 --> 01:03:46,641
Mcdonald's.
Just waiting in line for the dudes are 

1298
01:03:46,641 --> 01:03:49,581
way more aggressive in Boston than like 
say if you go out and try to get some 

1299
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:51,990
something eat in Texas,
you know,

1300
01:03:51,991 --> 01:03:54,030
people are generally pretty fucking 
friendly.

1301
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:57,420
Like everybody has this,
like a stereotype of Texas,

1302
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,870
but you're way safer going out to get 
some late night food in Texas.

1303
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:04,590
Especially like Austin Shit.
Austin's bad ass.

1304
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,900
That's one of the friendliest fucking 
cities in the country.

1305
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:12,170
You know,
you want to go get something to eat at 

1306
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:12,170
2:00
in the morning and Austin,

1307
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:12,360
you're fine.
She'll go get something to eat at 2:00

1308
01:04:12,361 --> 01:04:15,390
in the morning in Boston.
You might see a fucking assault,

1309
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:17,160
you know,
you might be a part or something.

1310
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:18,810
You got to watch where the fuck you're 
gone.

1311
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:20,230
Yeah.

1312
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:23,950
Okay,
please.

1313
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:25,660
Gentlemen,
we're going to go to the questions.

1314
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:27,430
Do you do,

1315
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:33,240
there's gotta be something you're not 
looking forward to about fatherhood.

1316
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:34,530
Well,
I'm already a father.

1317
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:40,160
I love it.
You know what you don't look forward to 

1318
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:40,160
is you,
you,

1319
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,340
you don't look forward to the fact that 
you're going to lose a lot of your time.

1320
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:43,770
You without a doubt,
you're going to have to spend.

1321
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:48,800
If you don't want to be a shitty parent,
you know if you've had a childhood that 

1322
01:04:48,961 --> 01:04:51,030
was less than perfect,
which I think most of us have,

1323
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:56,180
right you,
you learned from that and you're 

1324
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:58,881
supposed to be a better person and a 
better parent from that and once you 

1325
01:04:58,881 --> 01:04:58,950
have a fucking kid,
man,

1326
01:04:59,130 --> 01:04:59,910
it's like,
all right,

1327
01:04:59,911 --> 01:05:04,911
you have this in immense,
immense responsibility to raise a human 

1328
01:05:04,911 --> 01:05:07,350
being correctly and you've got to get 
your own shit together.

1329
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:12,530
You know it,
it forces you and you're going to 

1330
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:15,981
definitely have to look at things a 
little bit differently because you're 

1331
01:05:15,981 --> 01:05:17,140
not gonna have the same amount of free 
time and you can't look at yourself like

1332
01:05:17,141 --> 01:05:18,880
you're the only thing you know.

1333
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:23,910
That's what I was talking about before 
with like a lot of people that I know 

1334
01:05:23,910 --> 01:05:23,910
that aren't happy.
One of the reasons why they're not happy

1335
01:05:23,910 --> 01:05:25,210
is they don't have people in their life,
you know,

1336
01:05:25,211 --> 01:05:26,900
like that are really important.
You know,

1337
01:05:26,901 --> 01:05:29,950
like I know dudes that are like grown 
man that don't even have like really,

1338
01:05:29,951 --> 01:05:32,200
really close friends.
They have friends,

1339
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:35,000
but they're like keep shit from them and
you know,

1340
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:37,300
sometimes they get bad arguments with 
them and they don't,

1341
01:05:37,301 --> 01:05:40,180
they don't have anybody that they really
open up and are 100 percent honest with,

1342
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:43,120
which is really huge.
You know,

1343
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:48,180
if you don't have like a real friend 
that you could fucking tell everything 

1344
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:48,670
to,
you got to have those in your life.

1345
01:05:48,671 --> 01:05:51,130
Man.
Those are huge when we're all out.

1346
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:56,220
Like when it's me and Brian and Eddie 
and Joey and we're all out bullshit and 

1347
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:58,910
we tell each other basically everything,
you know,

1348
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:01,090
that's one of the fun things about it.

1349
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:06,230
You know,
one of the fun things about hanging out 

1350
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:06,230
with people that you really like is,
you know,

1351
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:09,640
you get to see inside each other.
It's fucking the wiring under the board.

1352
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,410
You get to see how your brain works.
You know,

1353
01:06:11,411 --> 01:06:16,411
you get to throw out the way you're 
thinking and what's going on in your 

1354
01:06:16,411 --> 01:06:19,951
life to them and see how you know a 
person who's not living your life but 

1355
01:06:19,951 --> 01:06:22,110
loves you and looks out for you and 
wants you to be happy.

1356
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:27,120
He gets to look at it and see it,
and that's very important for people 

1357
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:27,220
because sometimes you can't see your 
life objective,

1358
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:29,380
Lee.
Sometimes you need somebody in your life

1359
01:06:29,381 --> 01:06:32,770
that that cares about you,
and when people don't have that shit,

1360
01:06:32,771 --> 01:06:35,140
they don't feel like they have that 100 
percent honesty with someone.

1361
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:40,590
You already are disconnected to the 
universe and that's one of the reasons 

1362
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:40,590
why people get so depressed.

1363
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:42,970
You know you're depressed because you 
don't have all this love in your life.

1364
01:06:42,971 --> 01:06:45,610
You have to have a lot of love and you 
have to put it out there too.

1365
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:50,760
If you're putting out shit,
you're going to get shit back and then 

1366
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:51,190
you're going to get into a downward 
spiral that you'd ever gonna to put out.

1367
01:06:51,191 --> 01:06:53,290
Pull out of.
You're going to have a shitty life.

1368
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:55,810
You're putting out bad energy.
It's always coming back at you.

1369
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,910
You're gonna,
you're always going to be unlucky.

1370
01:06:57,911 --> 01:07:00,100
You're always going to be unhappy.
It's just the way it is.

1371
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,860
If you're an asshole,
you're not going to be happy assholes.

1372
01:07:02,861 --> 01:07:04,630
They look like they're happy because you
see them laughing.

1373
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:08,740
They go home and cry and drink or their 
fucking psycho and they have no emotions

1374
01:07:08,741 --> 01:07:12,060
whatsoever,
but no one is happy being negative.

1375
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:13,630
Everybody wants to be loving.

1376
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:17,410
Everybody wants to have good friends and
have a good fucking time.

1377
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:19,570
So this operator,
Greg,

1378
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:20,790
you're not going to live forever,
bitch,

1379
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:25,830
and you're not supposed to.
You're supposed to do what you can to 

1380
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:26,030
the people that you,
it,

1381
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:30,280
you influence and touch in this life and
hope that it carries on into the next.

1382
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:32,200
And we all know this,
we all know that,

1383
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,810
know this inherently and we all know 
inherently that people have done this to

1384
01:07:34,811 --> 01:07:35,690
us.
You know,

1385
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:41,130
like I said,
we've all met people that have inspired 

1386
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:41,130
us.
And uh,

1387
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:41,320
I think that's what we're here for.
I think that's what,

1388
01:07:41,321 --> 01:07:42,910
uh,
that's what we're supposed to do.

1389
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:45,430
It's just going to cover what are you 
playing?

1390
01:07:45,431 --> 01:07:46,720
Shit.
While I'm doing this,

1391
01:07:46,721 --> 01:07:48,640
while I'm talking.
What is this robot?

1392
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:52,670
Why you playing distracting shit.
Let me know when you're playing shit.

1393
01:07:52,730 --> 01:07:53,480
Tell me what it is.

1394
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:54,720
Okay.

1395
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:03,100
It's hard to read the questions off here
man.

1396
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,690
Any plans for a book?
Yeah,

1397
01:08:05,691 --> 01:08:05,990
I'm,
I'm,

1398
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:08,960
I'm writing a book man.
But the problem is I'm writing comedy at

1399
01:08:08,961 --> 01:08:12,950
the same time and I'm also writing blog 
entries and I'm also trying to do all my

1400
01:08:12,951 --> 01:08:16,340
other bullshit so it's some time,
you know,

1401
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:19,850
it's hard to sit down and just write a 
book because I sit down and write things

1402
01:08:19,851 --> 01:08:22,490
and I just want to write about one thing
that day and then I like,

1403
01:08:22,510 --> 01:08:25,040
that's what I like about blogs.
I can just write it,

1404
01:08:25,041 --> 01:08:26,630
throw it up and Bam,
there it is.

1405
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:32,140
But I'm always looking for new ways that
people could listen to my shit,

1406
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:38,140
get my ideas out there and get my stuff 
out there and kids come to see me doing 

1407
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:39,260
standup and you know,
the different ways to do that.

1408
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:43,310
You know,
it's like book books are legitimate.

1409
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:45,830
Wayne's they're wasted.
There's still a lot of people that don't

1410
01:08:45,831 --> 01:08:47,450
even have any idea that I'm a stand up 
comedian,

1411
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,280
you know,
just because I like stuff that I've done

1412
01:08:49,281 --> 01:08:54,281
that's not funny,
like fear factor and whatever and you 

1413
01:08:54,281 --> 01:08:54,560
know,
and doing commentary for the UFC,

1414
01:08:54,561 --> 01:08:59,561
it's the same thing.
It's like there's a lot of people that 

1415
01:08:59,561 --> 01:09:03,340
really have no idea that I'm even a 
comedian so I try to like do the best I 

1416
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:07,400
can to use all of the different avenues 
to get that out there.

1417
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:12,490
So I think a book is going to help.
And also I think it'd be cool to have 

1418
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:13,180
something that I actually wrote that 
book,

1419
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:18,480
you know,
I just think having a real book in the 

1420
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,630
bookstore is something cool about that 
book.

1421
01:09:20,631 --> 01:09:22,580
Takes lots of concentration,
smoke more weed.

1422
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:25,460
That's excellent advice.
I almost always write stoned,

1423
01:09:26,030 --> 01:09:27,530
you know,
and it might not make sense.

1424
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:30,440
The problem is greed it when I'm not 
stoned.

1425
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:35,500
I'm like,
what the fuck was I rambling about when 

1426
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:38,441
I'm high?
It's all like super genius Shit Dude.

1427
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:41,600
Dude.

1428
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:49,870
Yeah.
I was talking about depression and 

1429
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:49,870
Brian's playing a fucking robot video.

1430
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:50,900
Trying to lighten the mood,
Joe.

1431
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:55,770
We don't need that man.
Is Jason Ellis the best radio show to go

1432
01:09:55,771 --> 01:10:00,771
on?
Opie and Anthony is the best radio show 

1433
01:10:00,771 --> 01:10:00,771
to go on.
Jason Ellis is a close.

1434
01:10:00,771 --> 01:10:03,150
Second pitch was fun as fuck.
Jason's cool shit.

1435
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:04,980
He's a.
he's hilarious too.

1436
01:10:04,981 --> 01:10:07,080
I love listening to him.
He's just a,

1437
01:10:07,081 --> 01:10:11,430
he's cocky and he's funny and I just uh,
he's a cool dude.

1438
01:10:11,431 --> 01:10:12,900
I like him a lot.
I like that guy.

1439
01:10:12,901 --> 01:10:17,901
He's fun.
Too many guys in Boston where in 

1440
01:10:17,901 --> 01:10:21,801
affliction tee shirts.
Well there's nice people that were 

1441
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:24,261
affliction tee shirts to sir.
I goof around a fluxion tee shirts all 

1442
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:24,261
the time,
but I were there.

1443
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:25,530
Shit.
I bought their jeans.

1444
01:10:25,531 --> 01:10:26,850
I bought their dragon jeans.

1445
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:29,880
You're awful.
The genes are.

1446
01:10:30,270 --> 01:10:33,110
Genes are little much,
but I got some dope ass.

1447
01:10:33,111 --> 01:10:33,950
Um,
these uh,

1448
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:34,570
Japanese.

1449
01:10:34,590 --> 01:10:38,580
He's a Samurai ones from affliction does
this shit man.

1450
01:10:38,850 --> 01:10:41,610
The whole,
the whole like a mythical,

1451
01:10:41,611 --> 01:10:41,940
uh,
it's,

1452
01:10:41,941 --> 01:10:44,760
I think it's called heroes and demons.
It's bad ass.

1453
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:47,580
It's like Samurais flight and tigers and
shit.

1454
01:10:47,581 --> 01:10:52,581
And it's really cool art.
But there's a Japanese tattooist but 

1455
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:56,601
they don't make them anymore.
But I told Tom Tom Selection like those 

1456
01:10:56,601 --> 01:10:57,750
shirts and shit.
I love them.

1457
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,370
I used to,
before I smoked weed,

1458
01:10:59,371 --> 01:11:01,770
I used to dress terrible.
I think address bad now

1459
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:07,350
have leopard print stripes,
structured shirts with like I used to 

1460
01:11:07,751 --> 01:11:12,751
where things were really.
I used to wear like crushed red velvet 

1461
01:11:12,751 --> 01:11:16,711
shirts and crazy.
But I'm not choking crazy big Hawaiian 

1462
01:11:16,711 --> 01:11:18,210
shirts.
I'm a fashion retard.

1463
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:20,230
Like I always have been,
you know.

1464
01:11:20,231 --> 01:11:21,990
And that's why I still wear a fanny 
pack,

1465
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:24,090
like her wear a fanny pack all the time,
you know,

1466
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:27,270
whenever we travel I wear a fanny pack 
and a belt chain.

1467
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:28,500
Yeah.
And my chain,

1468
01:11:28,501 --> 01:11:30,170
my wallet chain.
Okay.

1469
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:31,140
The wall chain,
you know,

1470
01:11:31,141 --> 01:11:32,640
watch there.
I've lost my wallet before.

1471
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:34,170
I don't want to lose my wallet again.
Bam.

1472
01:11:34,171 --> 01:11:36,300
I got a wallet chain.
Nope.

1473
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:38,040
I like it.
I like it.

1474
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:43,250
I like it.
I like it too because a imperial rose 

1475
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:43,250
collection.
My man,

1476
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:43,920
David Tademan,
he made it for me.

1477
01:11:43,921 --> 01:11:45,720
He said to me,
this dude's that's really cool dude.

1478
01:11:45,721 --> 01:11:47,010
Who's a big MMA fan?

1479
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:48,900
Who's a jeweler?
And He sends me,

1480
01:11:48,901 --> 01:11:51,900
so to me it has power.
It's like a gift from somebody,

1481
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:54,270
you know.
So it's this cool chain that I like.

1482
01:11:54,271 --> 01:11:59,271
It gives me strength and I liked it.
I'm not gonna lose my fucking wallet 

1483
01:11:59,271 --> 01:11:59,271
again.
People are stupid.

1484
01:11:59,271 --> 01:12:01,720
You feel good for to.
You go to bed with her tonight.

1485
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:06,090
I like wear my baseball hat backwards.
I like having a wallet chain.

1486
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:08,580
If you think I look silly,
could make fun of me.

1487
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:13,640
I don't care how have you gone without 
wearing the lock chain from like I've 

1488
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:18,050
never.
I've waited a while chain for decades 

1489
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:18,050
and that's what I can't remember the 
last time.

1490
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:20,700
I didn't wear a wild chain when I was on
fear factor.

1491
01:12:20,701 --> 01:12:25,701
They used to make me tuck that shit in.
And it's weird because there's not many 

1492
01:12:25,701 --> 01:12:25,701
of you,
you know,

1493
01:12:25,701 --> 01:12:25,930
there's not many wallet chain diesels.

1494
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:27,540
I don't give a fuck.
I like it.

1495
01:12:27,570 --> 01:12:29,330
Do you ever run into any other wallet 
team?

1496
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:32,100
Would use a little compliment each other
on small chains.

1497
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,090
They'll do dudes look at the chain of.
Yeah,

1498
01:12:34,091 --> 01:12:37,350
that's pretty bad ass man.
And Dana White Gimme a dope ass one,

1499
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:41,160
so I wonder if you send it to you if you
would have a laugh.

1500
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,530
Dana White's given me to wallet chains.
That's so cool.

1501
01:12:43,531 --> 01:12:46,230
Dana white is.
But this is the one that I use now and I

1502
01:12:46,231 --> 01:12:47,880
can't wait.
I can you see it?

1503
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,150
Yeah,
I like it because it's a.

1504
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:55,220
it's all like handcrafted mass.
A little dragon head and the little 

1505
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:56,760
dragon head opens up and that clips on 
my belt.

1506
01:12:56,910 --> 01:12:58,650
Has it changed?
Is Dope chain.

1507
01:12:58,651 --> 01:13:01,440
It's really cool.
And for whatever fucking reason.

1508
01:13:01,441 --> 01:13:03,450
Okay.
This shit is metal as fuck,

1509
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:06,510
but it does not go off when you go 
through the metal detector.

1510
01:13:07,490 --> 01:13:09,420
I was stupid.
Or metal detectors.

1511
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:14,600
I will fucking kill you with this.
A tripod on the plane,

1512
01:13:14,971 --> 01:13:16,850
but you can have a fucking chain.
Yeah,

1513
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:21,851
I this thing,
this thing goes right through the metal 

1514
01:13:21,851 --> 01:13:21,851
detector.
It's weird.

1515
01:13:21,851 --> 01:13:26,150
It's crazy.
I mean you really have to think like 

1516
01:13:26,150 --> 01:13:26,150
that.
I mean,

1517
01:13:26,150 --> 01:13:29,631
I hope I shouldn't have opened my mouth.
Retards from TSA is watching this,

1518
01:13:30,421 --> 01:13:32,760
those fucking knuckle heads.
Some of them are cool.

1519
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:34,440
I ran into a lot of cool people at the 
airport,

1520
01:13:34,441 --> 01:13:38,610
but the laws is what's not cool.
None of it makes any god damn sense.

1521
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:40,680
You know,
put a Goddamn comp on a plane,

1522
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:42,860
on every plane.
Don't they already do that already?

1523
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:44,520
Well,
not every claim.

1524
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:47,780
She can't bring a pool cue on.
You could bring a skateboard,

1525
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:49,800
but you can't bring a pool cue and a 
laptop.

1526
01:13:49,801 --> 01:13:54,801
You can have a big Mac and you could 
have a laptop that you designed 

1527
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,480
purposely to free people up.
Totally.

1528
01:13:58,500 --> 01:13:59,370
Totally.
Yeah.

1529
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:04,230
It's totally worth it.
Shut up before we and making sure we get

1530
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:04,880
it all taken.

1531
01:14:07,190 --> 01:14:10,050
So how is Washington?
Washington was bad ass.

1532
01:14:10,051 --> 01:14:13,780
Washington DC show shows.
Great man.

1533
01:14:13,781 --> 01:14:15,760
We were at this place called the 9:30
club.

1534
01:14:15,761 --> 01:14:18,100
That's where I told you my phone fell 
and toilet.

1535
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:19,900
Awesome.
Awesome crowd.

1536
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:22,650
Really?
I don't get to dc very much and they.

1537
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:26,110
The last time I was there before we was 
with John Heffernan,

1538
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:28,330
Charlie Murphy when we did the maximum 
comedy tour.

1539
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:31,120
So you're in Miami Beach,
Florida next week,

1540
01:14:31,121 --> 01:14:31,890
right?
Yeah.

1541
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,420
I'm in Miami Beach,
Florida on the 22nd.

1542
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:39,450
Which is what is that,
and if I was looking at right now it is 

1543
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:42,990
a front page writer who will put the 
little calendar on Youtube.

1544
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:44,170
Yeah.
So next Friday.

1545
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:49,930
But Bam motherfuckers,
that's another place I'm not at very 

1546
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:49,930
often.
None.

1547
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:50,170
Florida very often.
Not in Miami very often,

1548
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:53,620
but I'm here Friday pictures actually 
fund that comedy Shit.

1549
01:14:53,621 --> 01:14:55,630
I guess there's going to be a lot of 
people in town for that.

1550
01:14:55,810 --> 01:14:57,880
You're making a lot of comics are going 
to be in town for that.

1551
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:58,620
Yeah.
Yeah.

1552
01:14:58,730 --> 01:15:00,100
That sounds cool.
Awesome.

1553
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:03,390
Powerful comedy festival.
And uh,

1554
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,100
tickets are selling really fast.
So if you want to go,

1555
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:10,120
I'm a go to where they were fucking uh,
uh,

1556
01:15:10,121 --> 01:15:13,480
I think that one is.
Do we have a lake somewhere?

1557
01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:14,500
Yeah.
You know what,

1558
01:15:14,501 --> 01:15:17,140
I'm going to throw the link on twitter 
because I'm such a bad ass bitch.

1559
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,120
That's what I was going to talk to you 
about.

1560
01:15:19,121 --> 01:15:19,660
What?
Uh,

1561
01:15:19,770 --> 01:15:22,900
it's through live nation said you're 
going to live nation.com.

1562
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:27,040
Each ticket they are charging 17 like 
something crazy,

1563
01:15:27,041 --> 01:15:29,290
like $15.
Like live nation,

1564
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:34,291
get to cut service,
charge $15 service charge for three 

1565
01:15:34,291 --> 01:15:37,921
tickets.
Some was saying that he was paying 

1566
01:15:37,921 --> 01:15:37,921
something like insane,
like 200 bucks or something.

1567
01:15:38,030 --> 01:15:39,580
Yeah,
go check it.

1568
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:41,970
Let's actually do it.
Well,

1569
01:15:41,971 --> 01:15:46,971
you know,
that's one of the things I like about 

1570
01:15:46,971 --> 01:15:48,360
like a regular goddamn comedy club or 
regular comedy club was the ticket cost.

1571
01:15:48,370 --> 01:15:51,340
Twenty five bucks.
You walk in the door and you pay your 25

1572
01:15:51,341 --> 01:15:53,770
bucks and that's it man.
You know?

1573
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:57,640
Or if you show up early you can go to 
the box office or you can order online.

1574
01:15:57,670 --> 01:16:00,010
You just buy it from the club and that's
what it costs.

1575
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:05,340
You go through an agency,
but if you're going to do like a big 

1576
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:08,161
concert or something like that,
you have to go through an agency that's 

1577
01:16:08,161 --> 01:16:08,161
another world.
You know,

1578
01:16:08,161 --> 01:16:11,910
once you start doing like big venues 
started doing like several thousand 

1579
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:11,910
people.
That's,

1580
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:13,660
that's a totally different world.
That's why I love comedy clubs.

1581
01:16:13,661 --> 01:16:18,661
That's first of all the shows better.
The shows are always better when it's 

1582
01:16:18,661 --> 01:16:19,540
like less than 600 people,
you know,

1583
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:22,180
once you get over like 600 people,
they're still fun.

1584
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:23,820
There's still a lot of fun.
You know,

1585
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:27,490
DC was more than 600 people I think,
but there's still,

1586
01:16:27,670 --> 01:16:29,170
it's still a good time.

1587
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:32,440
Don't get me wrong,
but it's just not the same experience.

1588
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:34,450
The same experience.
You get into comedy club,

1589
01:16:34,451 --> 01:16:36,790
it's like you're right there,
you're in the mix.

1590
01:16:36,791 --> 01:16:41,791
There's low ceilings and shit and it's 
just 300 of you and your fucking around 

1591
01:16:41,791 --> 01:16:42,650
just hanging out.
Okay.

1592
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:45,590
Three tickets gets to try to get the 
grant here.

1593
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:50,490
Tell me $159 and sixty cents.
Three tickets.

1594
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,400
A lot of money,
man.

1595
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:58,000
Have I smoked weed with Doug Benson?
Probably don't remember though.

1596
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:00,550
I must have a.
might not.

1597
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:05,600
Although I think I did once.
I think I showed him the solo pipe was 

1598
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:08,020
going to get them on.
I think Doug's very nice guy.

1599
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:10,130
Yeah,
he's a real cool guy.

1600
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,840
Very nice guy.
And he did his podcast.

1601
01:17:11,870 --> 01:17:12,740
He's very fun to.

1602
01:17:14,190 --> 01:17:16,050
He's got a um,
I love movies,

1603
01:17:16,051 --> 01:17:21,051
podcasts,
but I was totally useless on it because 

1604
01:17:21,051 --> 01:17:21,630
I'm not a big movie fan so they were 
bunk and they were all going on,

1605
01:17:21,631 --> 01:17:26,631
especially patent patent as well was on 
and he's a movie freak and they were 

1606
01:17:26,631 --> 01:17:30,501
just quoting all these weird obscure 
movies and weird and I just didn't know 

1607
01:17:30,501 --> 01:17:31,830
anything.
I was useless.

1608
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:33,210
They were like,
what's your favorite movie?

1609
01:17:33,211 --> 01:17:33,720
I'm like,
oh,

1610
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:38,730
I don't have one favorite movie.
I don't think I have a favorite movie 

1611
01:17:38,730 --> 01:17:41,320
man right now it's Avatar.
Just because I,

1612
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:45,600
I never get fit.
I've never felt like that before.

1613
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:47,940
You know,
I like in a movie like wow,

1614
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,310
like that movie,
like even though it was dumb,

1615
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:52,290
you know,
even though it was like Cliche,

1616
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,060
it didn't matter.
It felt.

1617
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:56,630
It felt so powerful,
you know?

1618
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,950
It goes like moved to tears almost a 
couple of times.

1619
01:17:58,951 --> 01:18:00,790
It's like me,
even though it was still,

1620
01:18:00,791 --> 01:18:04,410
it was like comic book style,
Super Powerful,

1621
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:06,450
you know,
the images and the way it was done,

1622
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:10,200
even though there was something,
some cliche shit in it doesn't matter.

1623
01:18:10,530 --> 01:18:15,530
Fucking awesome.
Did I get my Tomahawk Pipe?

1624
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:17,480
Yes,
I did,

1625
01:18:17,481 --> 01:18:20,480
sir.
Actually there is right here,

1626
01:18:21,770 --> 01:18:23,480
but we haven't used it because it's kind
of weak.

1627
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:25,520
It's very clogged already.
Yeah.

1628
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:26,600
Well it's just,
it's a.

1629
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:28,370
it's done.
It's done.

1630
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:31,270
You're not really supposed to smoke with
supposed to me.

1631
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:35,800
I've got to calm a hog.
Maybe it's a silly,

1632
01:18:38,930 --> 01:18:39,680
but yeah,
I got it.

1633
01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:41,090
I got it.
Just so I could show you guys.

1634
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:43,460
I got it.
When did I start smoking weed?

1635
01:18:43,461 --> 01:18:45,020
I didn't start till I was like 30 years 
old.

1636
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:48,470
That's why I'm so passionate about it 
because my whole life,

1637
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,240
I thought that if you smoke weed you'd 
be lazy.

1638
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,490
You'd be a loser.
Because I knew a lot of dudes when I was

1639
01:18:52,491 --> 01:18:57,491
a kid and the guys that did drugs,
the guys that were partying all the 

1640
01:18:57,491 --> 01:19:01,421
time,
they always want to fuck fucking their 

1641
01:19:01,421 --> 01:19:01,421
lives up and I was terrified of fucking 
my life up.

1642
01:19:01,421 --> 01:19:03,440
There was my number one fear was being a
loser.

1643
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:07,010
My number one I didn't mind.
My ambition was all fucked up because it

1644
01:19:07,011 --> 01:19:09,950
wasn't that I wanted to be happy and I 
wanted to,

1645
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:11,450
you know,
find some place,

1646
01:19:11,451 --> 01:19:14,400
have some point of success and do you 
know,

1647
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:16,340
uh,
achieve some goal or you know,

1648
01:19:16,430 --> 01:19:18,860
be the something for a living that I 
wanted to be.

1649
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:21,920
I wasn't doing that.
I was just trying not to be a loser.

1650
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:23,540
I was terrified I was going to be a 
loser.

1651
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:24,770
So,
um,

1652
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:26,090
you know,
I think,

1653
01:19:26,770 --> 01:19:31,770
uh,
I think that's very important to have 

1654
01:19:31,770 --> 01:19:31,770
the right mindset.
I,

1655
01:19:31,770 --> 01:19:33,280
you think like when you're growing up,
I'll try to answer that.

1656
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:35,900
Yeah.
I think it's a lot with parents,

1657
01:19:35,901 --> 01:19:37,550
but also,
you know,

1658
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:40,940
just how you were raised and the whole 
package and how people,

1659
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:43,920
how the people around you think too.
That's very important.

1660
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:46,490
You know,
I don't even remember what I was talking

1661
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:48,170
about,
how high we are.

1662
01:19:48,190 --> 01:19:51,710
There's a gentleman barbecued what we 
were talking about,

1663
01:19:51,711 --> 01:19:55,490
something real simple.
We're talking about Avatar.

1664
01:19:55,491 --> 01:19:59,630
And by the way,
I find myself saw three d and I loved it

1665
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:03,770
at fucking navy was so great.
Was the greatest movie ever to me.

1666
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:09,100
I said I don't have a favorite movie,
but I guess if I had to have a favorite 

1667
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:09,100
movie,

1668
01:20:09,190 --> 01:20:10,420
any news on Brock Lesnar?

1669
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,530
Um,
I heard randy couture.

1670
01:20:12,531 --> 01:20:15,710
So He's back in the gym.
That's awesome.

1671
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:21,040
You know,
more important than anything even as 

1672
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:21,040
dude never fight again.
You know,

1673
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:22,370
maybe he doesn't want to fight anymore.
Now you know,

1674
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:27,640
the most important thing is that he's 
healthy and the most important thing is 

1675
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:28,370
you ladies and gentlemen,
learn something from this situation,

1676
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:32,370
eat your vegetables.
It's very important to each of fiber and

1677
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:36,050
you got to clean out your intestinal 
tract by juicer.

1678
01:20:36,051 --> 01:20:39,310
This motherfucker's been juicing,
juicing like crazy and it's been,

1679
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:42,510
his whole life is like invigorated.
Right.

1680
01:20:42,530 --> 01:20:43,170
Gotcha,
Gotcha.

1681
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:45,980
Oh,
it's been like five minutes after taking

1682
01:20:45,981 --> 01:20:50,981
one of these juices.
I feel like I could just go do jumping 

1683
01:20:50,981 --> 01:20:50,981
jacks.

1684
01:20:50,981 --> 01:20:52,410
Why isn't this whack ass thing streaming
anymore?

1685
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:53,550
I don't know,
man.

1686
01:20:53,551 --> 01:20:55,560
I just forward to support soccer.

1687
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:58,120
Uh,
I use chrome now.

1688
01:20:58,210 --> 01:20:58,690
Oh,
this is,

1689
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:00,080
this is firefox.
You know what?

1690
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:01,850
I'm going to try to shut this.

1691
01:21:03,950 --> 01:21:06,060
I've been using chrome a lot lately.
I like criminal law.

1692
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:09,540
I think it's the best so know better so 
far.

1693
01:21:09,550 --> 01:21:13,170
He's the best I gave up on Firefox.
Firefox has been a worse lately.

1694
01:21:13,171 --> 01:21:16,710
Firefox has just been slow as fuck.
Really needs to be good.

1695
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:23,490
Yeah.
Firefox crashes sometimes on me.

1696
01:21:25,070 --> 01:21:30,070
Shut up for Fox.
I got all my fancy new fucking bad ass 

1697
01:21:30,070 --> 01:21:32,190
quick internet.
It shouldn't be on gate out.

1698
01:21:33,790 --> 01:21:36,870
A lot of people got really mad at me.
I did an interview recently and I talked

1699
01:21:36,871 --> 01:21:37,480
about,
uh,

1700
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:40,080
the use of the word faggot.
I was just explaining how,

1701
01:21:40,081 --> 01:21:45,081
what happened when I did the spike TV 
thing that they told him that I could 

1702
01:21:45,081 --> 01:21:47,871
say any word except faggot when,
when the show was uncensored and I was 

1703
01:21:48,151 --> 01:21:48,500
like,
this,

1704
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:52,680
that's so crazy because I'm not even 
talking to a person.

1705
01:21:52,681 --> 01:21:56,610
I'm talking to a dog and some aunts,
that's when I use the word faggot and it

1706
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:58,890
has nothing to do with sexual 
orientation,

1707
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,420
you know?
And I know Louis C,

1708
01:22:00,421 --> 01:22:04,110
k a actually has a bit on that,
about how it never met gay.

1709
01:22:04,111 --> 01:22:09,111
And it didn't.
Anthony Cooney and talks about it all 

1710
01:22:09,111 --> 01:22:09,111
the time on the opiod,
anthony,

1711
01:22:09,111 --> 01:22:11,700
about how fag it never really was a 
homosexual slur when we were kids.

1712
01:22:11,730 --> 01:22:13,590
It was,
it was not.

1713
01:22:13,591 --> 01:22:15,210
I mean,
but that's true,

1714
01:22:15,211 --> 01:22:19,800
but it's so sort of not true because you
knew that it also meant that,

1715
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,440
but people didn't use it that way.
That's not what it meant.

1716
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:27,950
And at the end of the day,
like what's language is supposed to 

1717
01:22:27,950 --> 01:22:29,280
represent is the context of your 
thoughts,

1718
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:34,580
you know,
and the problem is when words get hyper 

1719
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:34,770
powered,
like cunt or nigger or Faggot,

1720
01:22:34,771 --> 01:22:36,270
now faggot.
It's like the new one,

1721
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:37,830
you know,
or love.

1722
01:22:37,831 --> 01:22:40,080
Love's a hyper powered word too.
You know,

1723
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:45,350
these words get hyper powered and the 
word itself is more important than the 

1724
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:46,860
meaning behind the word.
You're not.

1725
01:22:46,861 --> 01:22:51,861
It's not a true expression anymore.
Like I mean a lot of people in 

1726
01:22:51,861 --> 01:22:52,740
relationships and you know,
he say you love me,

1727
01:22:52,741 --> 01:22:57,741
tell me you love me to love you.
It's like this weird fucking magic word 

1728
01:22:57,741 --> 01:22:58,020
thing that you have to say.

1729
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:01,740
It's like you should know by the way 
someone communicates with you whether or

1730
01:23:01,741 --> 01:23:06,741
not they love you.
It shouldn't have to say this one word 

1731
01:23:06,741 --> 01:23:09,861
shouldn't have all this goddamn power.
You know the same thing with the word 

1732
01:23:09,861 --> 01:23:12,370
nigger and the same thing with the word 
Faggot as a now I guess because this gay

1733
01:23:12,371 --> 01:23:15,790
guy told me when he was explaining this 
to me that I couldn't say Faggot,

1734
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:17,170
you know,
even if I didn't mean anything,

1735
01:23:17,171 --> 01:23:19,510
it didn't mean gay people.
I couldn't say it because I'm not gay.

1736
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:21,210
He said,
but gay people could say [inaudible].

1737
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:22,330
He goes,
it's our nigger.

1738
01:23:24,570 --> 01:23:29,570
Well,
of guys who is a kiss of John's 

1739
01:23:29,570 --> 01:23:30,570
protests,
some duty met on the streets.

1740
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,220
Wow,
that's shocking news.

1741
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:32,930
TMZ.
Well,

1742
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:36,710
it's great to be sued.
Who's Kissing A.

1743
01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:37,790
Obviously it's staged ladies and 
gentlemen.

1744
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:41,880
So this one's not staged for a where 
he's getting into an airplane,

1745
01:23:41,881 --> 01:23:43,020
kissing another gentlemen.

1746
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:45,550
Well,
you know,

1747
01:23:45,551 --> 01:23:47,590
maybe looks kissing gentleman doesn't 
mean he's gay.

1748
01:23:47,591 --> 01:23:52,591
Brian,
I don't know where you're going with 

1749
01:23:52,591 --> 01:23:52,591
this.
Listen,

1750
01:23:52,591 --> 01:23:53,200
just because John Travolta is kissing 
mounties photos

1751
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:57,630
and what did the audience said?
Dude was,

1752
01:23:57,770 --> 01:24:02,770
you want to say which,
and John Travolta is Gary than a room 

1753
01:24:02,770 --> 01:24:05,880
full of Dicks in Vegas?
One of my favorite things here.

1754
01:24:06,330 --> 01:24:07,670
Well,
clearly I was

1755
01:24:07,670 --> 01:24:09,440
just saying it in jest,
Ladies Gentlemen.

1756
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:14,620
I do not know who's homosexual.
There's a funny story that I've told 

1757
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:14,620
before,
but uh,

1758
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:19,311
it's true story.
There was a dude who was a fighter in 

1759
01:24:19,311 --> 01:24:22,631
this organization,
so other fighting organization outside 

1760
01:24:22,631 --> 01:24:24,320
of the UFC and uh,
this was like the nineties and they want

1761
01:24:24,321 --> 01:24:29,321
to do a.
wasn't a google search even it was an 

1762
01:24:29,321 --> 01:24:29,750
internet search on this man's name 
because they were going to write a story

1763
01:24:29,751 --> 01:24:33,920
about him to promote his show.
And as they were searching him,

1764
01:24:33,950 --> 01:24:38,950
they found out that someone with the 
same name was a gay porn star and not 

1765
01:24:40,341 --> 01:24:45,341
just a gay porn star,
but the winner of the hungriest bud 

1766
01:24:45,891 --> 01:24:50,891
contest,
not the runner up with the hungriest 

1767
01:24:50,891 --> 01:24:52,730
spot contest fucking winter.
This dude one,

1768
01:24:52,731 --> 01:24:56,570
the hungriest but contest and they 
didn't believe it was him.

1769
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:01,600
And then they just started searching 
more and they found photos and they 

1770
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:02,480
found photos of him.

1771
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:05,030
Like one dudes in his mouth,
one dude on his ass,

1772
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:09,860
and they're using them as like a Chinese
finger handcuffs and they found all this

1773
01:25:09,861 --> 01:25:11,630
porn on him.
Like the guy it was,

1774
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:13,730
you know,
it was used pretty easy to find,

1775
01:25:13,870 --> 01:25:18,870
you know,
when the information first got on the 

1776
01:25:18,870 --> 01:25:20,591
Internet,
porn was the first shit to get out 

1777
01:25:20,591 --> 01:25:22,541
there.
Porn was there before anything else 

1778
01:25:22,541 --> 01:25:22,580
before wikipedia,
before youtube,

1779
01:25:22,610 --> 01:25:25,580
porn was there.
So if you had porn on the Internet,

1780
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:28,160
like you could basically get even stuff 
that was illegal,

1781
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:31,220
like the early traci lords videos,
you could have got those elite,

1782
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:33,590
they could have got those back that you 
can't get those now.

1783
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,640
Like you'd go looking for a traci lords 
video now,

1784
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:37,820
anything that's illegal like that,
that shit is gone.

1785
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:40,370
But back then you could get.
So gay porn,

1786
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:42,890
it was all over the place.
This poor fuck.

1787
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:45,710
They pulled up all these pictures and 
videos and everything.

1788
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:47,910
Nick in front of them.
And he was like bullshit.

1789
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:52,960
But,
and then they showed him the photos and 

1790
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:52,960
you got all angry and he was the 
headliner.

1791
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:54,530
He was the big draw.
And uh,

1792
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:58,850
he just explained that he looked,
he was down on his luck and it was a lot

1793
01:25:58,851 --> 01:26:00,560
of money.
There was a lot of money.

1794
01:26:00,770 --> 01:26:01,880
And so he did it.
Well.

1795
01:26:01,881 --> 01:26:03,150
It turns out he did like 100 movies.

1796
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:10,410
And the joke is how much money is a lot 
of money to you because if I think you 

1797
01:26:10,410 --> 01:26:15,351
do one movie,
you live like you're in a Jay z video 

1798
01:26:15,351 --> 01:26:15,860
for the rest of your life.
That's what you want to do.

1799
01:26:15,861 --> 01:26:17,450
Gay Sex on video.
What?

1800
01:26:17,690 --> 01:26:19,760
That's,
I got to see some Zeros.

1801
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:24,880
I got to see a lot of commas and Zeros.
But this fucking guy did like a lot of 

1802
01:26:25,701 --> 01:26:29,280
these.
And the joke was 115 videos.

1803
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:34,300
By my accounts,
you should have all the money in the 

1804
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:36,611
world.
It should be no more money left for 

1805
01:26:36,611 --> 01:26:38,531
anybody else unless you like it.
See if you like socking decks and if 

1806
01:26:38,691 --> 01:26:43,691
you're gay then that's not bad at all.
There's no see this when people don't 

1807
01:26:43,691 --> 01:26:47,921
understand like just because someone 
thinks it's funny because they 

1808
01:26:47,921 --> 01:26:49,220
personally are not,
they don't want to have gay sex.

1809
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,380
That doesn't mean it's bad that you have
gay sex.

1810
01:26:51,410 --> 01:26:54,050
It's only bad for someone who doesn't 
want to have the gay sex.

1811
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:55,000
Right?
Brian?

1812
01:26:55,470 --> 01:26:57,620
Like if you're not gay and you do a gay 
porn,

1813
01:26:58,310 --> 01:27:01,010
that's a big deal.
But if you're gaining do a gay porn,

1814
01:27:01,150 --> 01:27:03,620
it's like so up.
You're sucking dicks.

1815
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:06,050
Is it any more embarrassing that you're 
doing a video?

1816
01:27:07,790 --> 01:27:10,370
It's the same.
It's no different,

1817
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:12,920
but if you're straight and you're out 
there blogging guys on video.

1818
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:14,680
Oh,

1819
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:22,200
I stupid about it.
My Act that if a guy is like straight 

1820
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,370
and he's blown a guy,
you know that if you like made a mistake

1821
01:27:24,371 --> 01:27:29,371
one night and day like you'll never win 
an argument ever for the rest of your 

1822
01:27:29,371 --> 01:27:29,560
life because as soon as you get in the 
argument,

1823
01:27:29,561 --> 01:27:34,561
as soon as shit starts getting real,
now you don't even believe people were 

1824
01:27:34,561 --> 01:27:35,500
on the moon like didn't you start a dick
once and that's the end.

1825
01:27:35,570 --> 01:27:40,570
The arguments over.
There's no way you can bounce back from 

1826
01:27:40,570 --> 01:27:40,570
that,
but what?

1827
01:27:41,230 --> 01:27:43,590
You got a dick in your mouth,
it's conversation's over.

1828
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:46,080
You can't trust the judgment anymore.
You've,

1829
01:27:46,170 --> 01:27:50,170
you've defeated him.
You've deflated him as a human.

1830
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:56,260
Do I feel very blessed to be as famous 
as I am,

1831
01:27:56,261 --> 01:27:58,360
says genuine evil.
80 six.

1832
01:27:58,361 --> 01:27:59,650
That's hilarious.
Um,

1833
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:04,720
yeah.
I'm just famous enough where it's not 

1834
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:05,530
creepy now I'm just famous enough where 
no one takes me seriously.

1835
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:10,560
First of all,
the fear factor was definitely a 

1836
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:10,560
blessing in disguise because,
you know what I'm saying?

1837
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:10,990
Like,
you know,

1838
01:28:10,991 --> 01:28:15,991
you get to a place where like,
a lot of people are like real super 

1839
01:28:15,991 --> 01:28:16,580
famous people that are like loved and 
worshiped,

1840
01:28:16,970 --> 01:28:21,970
you know,
rock stars or Michael Jackson or 

1841
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:21,970
something like that,
or Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt,

1842
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:25,180
like their prisoners.
Like they can't go anywhere.

1843
01:28:25,210 --> 01:28:27,460
Like that is a terrible way to live.
Like,

1844
01:28:27,461 --> 01:28:29,590
yeah,
everybody is fascinated by you,

1845
01:28:29,591 --> 01:28:31,720
including me.
If I saw Brad Pitt in a restaurant,

1846
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,550
I was like,
point stare like me.

1847
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:35,890
You want to hear something crazy?
Me and Kevin James.

1848
01:28:35,891 --> 01:28:38,020
Okay.
And Kevin James is fucking famous,

1849
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:38,850
right?
That,

1850
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:42,490
that Goddamn.
I'm Paul Blart Mall cop movie.

1851
01:28:42,491 --> 01:28:44,740
He did made like $200,
million dollars.

1852
01:28:44,741 --> 01:28:49,741
Okay.
And Kevin and I are in Boston and we're 

1853
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:49,870
in a hotel room and Tom Cruise was in 
Boston too.

1854
01:28:49,871 --> 01:28:52,360
And Tom Cruise on the street.
Okay.

1855
01:28:52,610 --> 01:28:57,610
And Kevin's fucking hotel room.
And Kevin's like Tom Cruise is out 

1856
01:28:57,610 --> 01:28:57,610
there.
Look.

1857
01:28:57,610 --> 01:29:01,010
And so leaning out the window looking at
Tom,

1858
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:01,980
we're on

1859
01:29:02,150 --> 01:29:05,010
the 10th floor and Shit and Tom cruises 
on the ground floor.

1860
01:29:05,130 --> 01:29:06,960
And we'll like looking at him across the
street like,

1861
01:29:06,970 --> 01:29:11,970
Woo,
I'm a movie star is Gawking at another 

1862
01:29:11,970 --> 01:29:12,690
movie star.
It was pretty interesting to watch.

1863
01:29:12,691 --> 01:29:13,570
I was like,
you're,

1864
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:17,310
I go do you know you're that famous.
Like he's not as famous as Tom Cruise,

1865
01:29:17,311 --> 01:29:21,420
but he's fucking really famous.
I mean it's silly that he's like so fat,

1866
01:29:21,421 --> 01:29:22,890
but that's what it is,
man.

1867
01:29:22,950 --> 01:29:25,010
People,
people are,

1868
01:29:25,011 --> 01:29:26,230
are,
are nutty about,

1869
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:28,050
about fame.
That's not a good level.

1870
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:33,110
You don't want to be there that you want
to be at the level where you don't have 

1871
01:29:33,110 --> 01:29:33,110
to worry about your bills and you,
uh,

1872
01:29:33,110 --> 01:29:34,890
you know,
you're able to do what you want to do.

1873
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:36,810
Like as far as creatively,
you know,

1874
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:38,940
that's what I liked.
I liked the fact that I could do comedy,

1875
01:29:39,570 --> 01:29:44,570
I can do the UFC,
I do what I want to do and I'm enjoying 

1876
01:29:44,570 --> 01:29:44,570
myself,
you know,

1877
01:29:44,570 --> 01:29:46,110
and it's fun and people enjoy what I'm 
doing and you know,

1878
01:29:46,111 --> 01:29:48,330
you develop fans,
you develop people that are appreciating

1879
01:29:48,331 --> 01:29:50,970
what you do and you appreciate them and 
it's a good relationship.

1880
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:53,580
That's good level of fame.
You don't want to be,

1881
01:29:53,730 --> 01:29:58,730
you know,
you don't want to be somewhere like I 

1882
01:29:58,730 --> 01:30:01,431
was.
I was watching some video online where 

1883
01:30:01,431 --> 01:30:01,431
the guy.
Can you put that video up,

1884
01:30:01,431 --> 01:30:04,791
the dude when George Bush went to a 
restaurant and he's with five secret 

1885
01:30:04,791 --> 01:30:06,750
service agents and the guy is screaming 
and yelling at him,

1886
01:30:06,751 --> 01:30:10,890
you fucking murder or Zionist murdering 
piece of shit.

1887
01:30:10,891 --> 01:30:14,730
And some Guy George Bush senior has to.
The dude is like,

1888
01:30:14,731 --> 01:30:16,440
he's an old man.
He's been around forever.

1889
01:30:16,590 --> 01:30:20,300
He has to travel everywhere with these 
bodyguards everywhere he goes.

1890
01:30:20,301 --> 01:30:22,470
He have secret service guys surrounding 
him and yeah,

1891
01:30:22,471 --> 01:30:23,580
I know what you're saying.
Yeah,

1892
01:30:23,770 --> 01:30:28,770
no,
he caused wars and he's responsible for 

1893
01:30:28,770 --> 01:30:30,981
all these people dying.
I see it 100 percent and it's not like 

1894
01:30:30,981 --> 01:30:34,941
being a movie star,
but it's the same thing in as far as 

1895
01:30:34,941 --> 01:30:34,941
like,
well,

1896
01:30:34,941 --> 01:30:35,940
no,
because people are angry at him.

1897
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:37,620
Okay.
My point is terrible,

1898
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:40,770
but it is right because people were 
angry at him.

1899
01:30:40,771 --> 01:30:45,771
I mean he's the reason why he's got all 
those people around because people want 

1900
01:30:45,771 --> 01:30:48,111
him dead.
Everybody wants Brad Pitt dead is 

1901
01:30:48,111 --> 01:30:48,111
fucking crazy.
But the point is,

1902
01:30:48,330 --> 01:30:50,580
any level of fame,
you know,

1903
01:30:50,581 --> 01:30:53,970
past a certain level can be.
It becomes a handicap.

1904
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:56,370
It becomes like food.
If you have some food,

1905
01:30:56,610 --> 01:30:58,530
you should only eat until you're not 
hungry anymore.

1906
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:01,500
You shouldn't fucking gorgeous self and 
go God damn crazy.

1907
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:06,820
You know,
it's very difficult to manage any level 

1908
01:31:06,820 --> 01:31:08,320
of fame and to manage the kind of fame 
that those guys have managed.

1909
01:31:08,330 --> 01:31:09,690
I mean,
it's almost impossible.

1910
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:10,530
That's why.
How,

1911
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:13,890
why do you think Tom Cruise is so crazy?
You have to be crazy.

1912
01:31:14,310 --> 01:31:16,620
No one cannot be crazy if you're that 
famous.

1913
01:31:16,621 --> 01:31:20,130
It's like impossible.
Like who can manage that kind of thing?

1914
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:20,890
You know,
like when,

1915
01:31:20,891 --> 01:31:24,510
when he was on Matt Lauer talking about 
psychiatrists and antidepressants,

1916
01:31:24,511 --> 01:31:26,470
like you're Glib,
your Glib,

1917
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:28,830
like he doesn't even realize how 
retarded he sounds.

1918
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:33,980
No one tells him,
no one tells him that he's talking 

1919
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:33,980
nonsense.
He doesn't have a voice of reason around

1920
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:35,040
him.
He doesn't have objectivity,

1921
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:36,440
doesn't have anybody who talks to him 
real.

1922
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:41,600
He has people who gawk and stare and 
look like Kevin James and I from the 

1923
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,560
10th floor of a hotel,
Tom Cruise.

1924
01:31:43,650 --> 01:31:48,650
No one's given that guy the real shit.
So when he gets on television and talks 

1925
01:31:48,650 --> 01:31:49,620
with nonsense like he doesn't,
he has no idea what nonsense is.

1926
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:54,800
He's crazy because he's super,
super famous and it's like almost 

1927
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,190
impossible to not be crazy.
We're all.

1928
01:31:56,191 --> 01:31:59,710
The rules are completely different for 
you than they are for everybody else.

1929
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:04,360
The rules for everybody else or most 
people have to create an impression they

1930
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:04,510
have.

1931
01:32:04,570 --> 01:32:06,790
You meet someone that you know,
you tell them,

1932
01:32:06,810 --> 01:32:09,550
you know what your name is,
what you're all about with him.

1933
01:32:09,551 --> 01:32:11,200
Everywhere he goes,
they know everything.

1934
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:14,320
They know he's the same tologist.
They know he's the greatest fucking,

1935
01:32:14,321 --> 01:32:16,540
most successful movie star in the 
history of the world.

1936
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:18,370
I mean,
that fucking guy can't go anywhere.

1937
01:32:18,490 --> 01:32:20,910
Everybody wants to say he's like five 
foot one and oh,

1938
01:32:20,990 --> 01:32:25,390
he's gay and he's fucking crazy and 
everybody's staring and scrutinize them.

1939
01:32:25,391 --> 01:32:26,740
You know that marriage that he had,
that first one,

1940
01:32:26,741 --> 01:32:30,010
that called and that was all set up and 
I was on a real.

1941
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:33,160
Everybody's constantly up in a shit.
How could you not be crazy?

1942
01:32:34,150 --> 01:32:34,870
Right?
Yeah.

1943
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:38,350
Brian gets a.
He gets a lot of internet fame.

1944
01:32:38,410 --> 01:32:40,390
You got a lot of Weirdos.
They get upset at you.

1945
01:32:41,170 --> 01:32:43,300
You got a lot of weird.
How about that Pepsi Spice thing?

1946
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:44,190
Listen,
listen,

1947
01:32:44,210 --> 01:32:45,290
this story,
this,

1948
01:32:45,291 --> 01:32:50,291
this dude,
when Pepsi guys remember when Pepsi 

1949
01:32:50,291 --> 01:32:53,280
Spice was around,
well Brian is like one of the Internet 

1950
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:53,280
gangsters.
He was like,

1951
01:32:53,290 --> 01:32:56,230
he was aware of Shit.
The companies weren't aware of.

1952
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:58,150
You know,
companies were like these multi,

1953
01:32:58,151 --> 01:33:03,151
multi billion dollar companies,
but there really weren't deep in the 

1954
01:33:03,151 --> 01:33:06,631
Internet.
They didn't understand the impact it 

1955
01:33:06,631 --> 01:33:06,631
had.
So when Pepsi Spice came out,

1956
01:33:06,631 --> 01:33:10,890
they didn't have Pepsi Spice Dot Com.
So Brian Bought Pepsi slice on and Brian

1957
01:33:12,131 --> 01:33:15,260
started putting up all these crazy 
because it's still up.

1958
01:33:15,261 --> 01:33:16,150
Or did you get sued?

1959
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:17,610
Uh,
the website?

1960
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:22,640
Yeah,
I let it go because I was tired of 

1961
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:22,640
paying for it and they weren't bringing 
back the.

1962
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:24,130
Did you give it to them?
Uh,

1963
01:33:24,180 --> 01:33:24,960
no.
I just let it go.

1964
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:26,940
Somebody picked somebody else pick it 
up.

1965
01:33:26,970 --> 01:33:31,970
But what did you do with all those,
those crazy stories that you wrote on 

1966
01:33:31,970 --> 01:33:34,731
it?
I will tell everybody about the stores 

1967
01:33:34,731 --> 01:33:37,370
pretty much.
I just copied off that Morgan spurlock 

1968
01:33:37,370 --> 01:33:37,490
guy and I,
I said that I was going to drink pepsi,

1969
01:33:37,790 --> 01:33:41,910
Pepsi holiday spice for 30 days.
What are the people that don't know?

1970
01:33:41,911 --> 01:33:45,030
That's from supersize me and ate 
Mcdonald's for 30 days.

1971
01:33:45,031 --> 01:33:46,200
It's a documentary.
Pretty good one.

1972
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:47,370
Yeah.
And so,

1973
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:48,360
so,
uh,

1974
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:51,540
I had,
I could only have pepsi spice to eat and

1975
01:33:51,541 --> 01:33:53,460
drink for 30 days,
which is alone.

1976
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:55,710
The dumbest thing in the world that 
anyone believed it,

1977
01:33:55,770 --> 01:33:57,420
you know,
like I'm not going to eat food.

1978
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:58,330
I'm going to,
you know,

1979
01:33:58,390 --> 01:34:03,390
have.
So that started having like the first 

1980
01:34:03,390 --> 01:34:03,760
couple of days they started having these
lesions and stuff like,

1981
01:34:03,770 --> 01:34:06,930
can you photoshop these things on fake 
things?

1982
01:34:06,931 --> 01:34:11,931
I made myself look more and more sick.
I was losing weight and I was telling 

1983
01:34:11,931 --> 01:34:15,340
him like my photoshopping fat off me and
what's crazy is then I started getting 

1984
01:34:15,421 --> 01:34:20,421
interviews from radio stations thinking 
it's real and I have it somewhere like 

1985
01:34:20,421 --> 01:34:21,980
this two hour interview where a college 
radio station.

1986
01:34:22,170 --> 01:34:23,940
It was real.
And uh,

1987
01:34:23,941 --> 01:34:28,941
I had people actually I started really 
thinking I was like dying and stuff like

1988
01:34:29,191 --> 01:34:34,191
that.
And then one day I stopped like 20 days 

1989
01:34:34,191 --> 01:34:34,191
in and people all thought I died.

1990
01:34:36,650 --> 01:34:39,230
It was one of the great trolls.
One of the all time.

1991
01:34:39,231 --> 01:34:40,670
Great trolls.
Yeah,

1992
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:41,920
it was really brilliant.
Yeah.

1993
01:34:41,930 --> 01:34:44,630
Just look up Pepsi spice projects,
but something's gone.

1994
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:47,240
Goddamn brilliant.
Trolls on the Internet,

1995
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:50,660
you know,
the best is Doug Stan hope on Baiting,

1996
01:34:50,661 --> 01:34:55,661
baiting.org.
Doug Stan hope would go and bait 

1997
01:34:55,661 --> 01:34:57,620
pedophiles and then right,
like I think they did a about it.

1998
01:34:57,621 --> 01:34:59,600
Then they do a book,
they put it in a book form of thing.

1999
01:34:59,601 --> 01:35:00,650
Yeah,
I think so.

2000
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:04,100
I believe it's still available on,
if you go to Doug Stan hope.com,

2001
01:35:04,310 --> 01:35:06,860
you'll probably have a link to it 
somewhere because one of those,

2002
01:35:06,861 --> 01:35:11,861
one of the funniest things that doug 
ever did and he would pretend to be a 

2003
01:35:11,861 --> 01:35:16,360
little girl and Laura pedophiles and say
like all kinds of fucked up shit and it 

2004
01:35:16,911 --> 01:35:18,770
was really,
really genius stuff.

2005
01:35:18,810 --> 01:35:19,340
I,
I don't,

2006
01:35:19,341 --> 01:35:21,350
I can't pull any of the quotes off the 
top of my head,

2007
01:35:21,351 --> 01:35:26,180
but I remember really laughing really 
hard and wanting to do the same thing,

2008
01:35:26,181 --> 01:35:26,630
but I don't have

2009
01:35:26,670 --> 01:35:29,010
that kind of commitment.
Doug is.

2010
01:35:29,011 --> 01:35:30,570
Doug is an animal.
He's a pit bull.

2011
01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:33,480
The level of commitment that he has 
towards trolling.

2012
01:35:34,310 --> 01:35:37,050
I don't know.
I'm not into like goofing on.

2013
01:35:37,051 --> 01:35:39,940
People don't know why like that.
Like I,

2014
01:35:39,941 --> 01:35:42,000
I get bored.
I mean I,

2015
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:47,120
I'll argue with people and I'll make fun
of someone but like pretending to be 

2016
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:48,810
someone else going back and forth for 
whatever reason.

2017
01:35:48,811 --> 01:35:50,400
My brain doesn't work that way,
you know?

2018
01:35:50,910 --> 01:35:52,980
I don't know why I don't get into those 
trolls,

2019
01:35:53,100 --> 01:35:55,740
but I love watching them like that.
Pepsi Spice One.

2020
01:35:55,741 --> 01:35:57,210
I love that one.
That was awesome.

2021
01:35:57,211 --> 01:35:58,470
And Doug's.
I loved them.

2022
01:35:58,530 --> 01:35:59,460
I just don't.
I don't.

2023
01:35:59,730 --> 01:36:00,840
My brain doesn't think like that.

2024
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:03,810
Here's that.
Here's when I actually.

2025
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:06,850
This is when the first video site did 
special effects on.

2026
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:12,120
Here's the,
here's the video from Pepsi spice where 

2027
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:15,230
it's like one of the first times I did 
like a real good special bad assets as 

2028
01:36:15,230 --> 01:36:15,660
video and video shit.
This is dope folks.

2029
01:36:15,810 --> 01:36:17,780
Just like we've got a real God damn show
here.

2030
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:21,720
People can you see it by the way,
all the Shit I do.

2031
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:23,250
This is probably one of the funniest 
things I do.

2032
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:24,450
This is fun.
You know,

2033
01:36:24,451 --> 01:36:25,350
we look forward to this.

2034
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:44,710
Who's that?
Good job pushing up.

2035
01:36:46,230 --> 01:36:48,110
It's me.
I'm fucking myself.

2036
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:55,370
Pepsi spreads.
Oh,

2037
01:36:55,380 --> 01:37:00,380
this is my spice.
That guy that people would think.

2038
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:06,200
Chicken Pepsi's.
That's hilarious.

2039
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:23,000
Oh,
that's hilarious.

2040
01:37:23,001 --> 01:37:24,940
Dude.
That's very fine.

2041
01:37:26,310 --> 01:37:28,770
Have I seen Jessie Ventura's nurse new 
show?

2042
01:37:28,771 --> 01:37:29,970
No,
I have not.

2043
01:37:30,150 --> 01:37:35,150
I'm not seeing Jesse Ventura's new show.
I don't know shit about Jesse Ventura's 

2044
01:37:35,150 --> 01:37:39,201
new show.
I know it's some sort of a crazy 

2045
01:37:39,201 --> 01:37:40,180
conspiracy theory.
Sounds awesome.

2046
01:37:40,510 --> 01:37:42,700
I like conspiracy theories up to a 
point.

2047
01:37:42,830 --> 01:37:44,480
My God,
dude,

2048
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:47,560
Brian's going to pay.
You guys want to see his Dick?

2049
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:55,650
Can you talk about the music you like?
You should listen to phish dead

2050
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:59,460
wires.
Call what the fuck?

2051
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:01,650
My toilet.
How do you even know?

2052
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:06,750
What is your name?
P Q I l e s 24.

2053
01:38:07,230 --> 01:38:09,030
This is the dude who likes the dead and 
the fish.

2054
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:10,770
Okay,
man,

2055
01:38:11,490 --> 01:38:14,670
I don't get the dead or the fish.
I don't get it.

2056
01:38:14,730 --> 01:38:19,730
I understand that you like it and I 
would never say that it's not good 

2057
01:38:19,730 --> 01:38:20,670
because it's obviously good to you.
You know,

2058
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I gave up saying some things suck a long
time ago when people like them because 

2059
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,200
it occurred to me somewhere along the 
line that they,

2060
01:38:27,220 --> 01:38:31,710
even though they suck for me,
even though I do think they suck as long

2061
01:38:31,711 --> 01:38:33,150
as you know,
what do I care?

2062
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:35,850
As long as it's not promoting anything 
ridiculously stupid.

2063
01:38:35,851 --> 01:38:36,780
Well,
as long as it's not,

2064
01:38:36,990 --> 01:38:39,470
you know,
reinforcing retarded behavior as long as

2065
01:38:39,550 --> 01:38:42,900
it's not negative for human beings.
What do I give a shit?

2066
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:44,160
You know,
you think it's good.

2067
01:38:44,161 --> 01:38:46,140
You like it?
I can't get into it,

2068
01:38:46,141 --> 01:38:48,330
man.
I can't listen to the debt on that.

2069
01:38:48,510 --> 01:38:53,510
I tried,
I did this grateful dead experiment 

2070
01:38:53,510 --> 01:38:53,510
where,
uh,

2071
01:38:53,510 --> 01:38:57,000
I tried to listen to it for 30 days,
but I was hating it so much that I 

2072
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:57,270
didn't want to run.
I was going to write about it.

2073
01:38:57,271 --> 01:39:00,330
I was going to read,
I was going to listen to dad for 30 days

2074
01:39:00,331 --> 01:39:03,150
and then write about it at the end.
It's just not my shit,

2075
01:39:03,870 --> 01:39:05,130
but that's okay.
You know what I mean?

2076
01:39:05,131 --> 01:39:08,130
You can like it.
But like I was listening to the dead one

2077
01:39:08,131 --> 01:39:12,570
day and uh,
I put on right after I listened to it.

2078
01:39:12,571 --> 01:39:17,571
I was listening to for like an hour and 
then I put on midnight rider by the 

2079
01:39:17,571 --> 01:39:19,500
allman brothers and I never listened to 
the debt again.

2080
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:22,410
I was like,
are you fucking kidding me man?

2081
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:24,270
Are you fucking kidding me?
I mean,

2082
01:39:24,271 --> 01:39:29,271
look,
I know some people like the grateful 

2083
01:39:29,271 --> 01:39:29,271
dead and I understand and I appreciate 
it and shit like that,

2084
01:39:29,271 --> 01:39:29,700
but,
but listen,

2085
01:39:29,701 --> 01:39:32,650
man,
there's some fucking music that there's,

2086
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:36,840
there's some music this on another level
and in my opinion,

2087
01:39:36,990 --> 01:39:39,750
the shit from looking for this.
Why am I making sense here?

2088
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:40,860
I'm looking for the song.

2089
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:49,210
Shut the fuck up.

2090
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:54,370
Um,

2091
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:57,910
I spoke to her damn own brothers,
you know,

2092
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:03,000
this is a whack ass setup.
What is the basic building makes 

2093
01:40:09,161 --> 01:40:10,470
himself.
You can't,

2094
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:11,930
you're going to get arrested.
Huh?

2095
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:13,690
You're going to get a right.
You could do this.

2096
01:40:13,810 --> 01:40:14,450
You,
yeah.

2097
01:40:14,770 --> 01:40:16,240
This is a picture of a picture.

2098
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:17,420
Oh really?
Yeah.

2099
01:40:17,490 --> 01:40:18,740
You allowed to do that?
Well,

2100
01:40:18,741 --> 01:40:20,160
I mean,
so that's the UFC.

2101
01:40:20,161 --> 01:40:20,460
They'll see the.

2102
01:40:23,070 --> 01:40:24,720
I can't find the allman brothers.

2103
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:29,750
Here we go.

2104
01:40:31,070 --> 01:40:32,450
Okay.
Shut that off for a second.

2105
01:40:35,010 --> 01:40:38,250
Listen to this shit.
Listen to machine.

2106
01:40:40,850 --> 01:40:41,820
Oh,
that's rambling man.

2107
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:46,370
That's not what it was.
It was midnight rider fucking con.

2108
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:49,610
Do I not have that?
How is that possible?

2109
01:40:49,970 --> 01:40:53,980
I get it out of my fucking phone.
How do I not have it on my itunes?

2110
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:55,850
Oh,
there it is.

2111
01:40:55,851 --> 01:40:56,990
You Bitch.
Okay,

2112
01:40:56,991 --> 01:41:01,991
here we go.
What the Hell is gonna?

2113
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:15,540
Meet your screen.
You're going to hear this immediately.

2114
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:16,600
You have to meet your screen.

2115
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:18,910
Oh,
otherwise it won't play,

2116
01:41:18,911 --> 01:41:19,810
right?
Is that what it is?

2117
01:41:20,220 --> 01:41:21,640
Well,
you're just gonna Echo yourself.

2118
01:41:21,670 --> 01:41:21,970
Okay.

2119
01:41:25,300 --> 01:41:30,300
Yeah.
Alright,

2120
01:41:33,510 --> 01:41:38,510
here we go.
You know you can listen to the grateful 

2121
01:41:43,741 --> 01:41:45,600
dead all day.
That's all good.

2122
01:41:47,390 --> 01:41:52,390
This plane did terrible.
Let me know.

2123
01:42:13,350 --> 01:42:15,000
I listen to that.
Ah Man,

2124
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,550
I can't go back.
I can't go back to the grateful dead.

2125
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:19,500
I can't do it.
I understand it.

2126
01:42:19,501 --> 01:42:22,530
If you like it,
it's not my shit.

2127
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:25,830
I like some rap music.
I like seventies music.

2128
01:42:26,330 --> 01:42:27,840
The midnight ride from the allman 
brothers.

2129
01:42:27,870 --> 01:42:29,430
I don't know if it sounded good to you 
guys.

2130
01:42:29,610 --> 01:42:31,290
It sounded awesome.
So great.

2131
01:42:31,291 --> 01:42:35,760
God Damn fucking song.
Just to some of the shit they did in the

2132
01:42:35,761 --> 01:42:39,930
seventies,
man and stuff just so resonates today,

2133
01:42:39,931 --> 01:42:40,710
man.
You know,

2134
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:45,870
you listen to some,
some of the sixties and seventies music 

2135
01:42:45,870 --> 01:42:46,860
Zeplin the doors and just there's 
something about it man,

2136
01:42:46,890 --> 01:42:49,260
that like when I'm like in a mood,
don't want to hear something.

2137
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:52,030
Especially if you smoke a joint and you 
know,

2138
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:53,670
you sit in front of a computer,
you want to write,

2139
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,610
I'll put on some fucking classic rock 
man.

2140
01:42:56,611 --> 01:42:58,140
It just,
it makes you,

2141
01:42:58,590 --> 01:43:01,560
it just makes you feel more connected.

2142
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:03,840
It's just like there's something about 
that music,

2143
01:43:03,841 --> 01:43:07,710
like whatever they were doing at the 
time and they were making that music.

2144
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:09,410
They were nailing it.
They,

2145
01:43:09,630 --> 01:43:10,230
it,
you know,

2146
01:43:10,231 --> 01:43:12,900
there's music from that era that doesn't
smell at all,

2147
01:43:12,901 --> 01:43:15,990
like commercial.
It doesn't smell at all.

2148
01:43:15,991 --> 01:43:17,980
Like,
like they were trying to,

2149
01:43:18,030 --> 01:43:20,060
you know,
to trick people or do something,

2150
01:43:20,061 --> 01:43:25,061
thought it was going to be successful.
There's a bunch of music from that era 

2151
01:43:25,061 --> 01:43:25,330
that's just beautiful man.
It's just a lie.

2152
01:43:25,350 --> 01:43:27,810
It's like the pure,
the purest version of,

2153
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:29,850
of musical art.
You know,

2154
01:43:29,851 --> 01:43:31,890
and I think it's because they were all 
doing psychedelic drugs.

2155
01:43:31,891 --> 01:43:33,330
I mean,
I think there are a lot to do with it.

2156
01:43:33,331 --> 01:43:35,130
Everybody was high,
everybody was smoking pot.

2157
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:40,340
They were dropping acid and taking 
mushrooms and they were coming out with 

2158
01:43:40,340 --> 01:43:41,700
dope fucking music man.
And today,

2159
01:43:41,701 --> 01:43:44,460
still to this day,
I mean no one's going to be listening to

2160
01:43:44,461 --> 01:43:44,910
pop,
pop,

2161
01:43:44,911 --> 01:43:46,260
pop,
pop poker face.

2162
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:47,880
No one's going to listen to that in 30 
years.

2163
01:43:48,060 --> 01:43:51,810
No one's going to listen.
That 40 years led Zepplin will be around

2164
01:43:51,811 --> 01:43:53,720
in 40 years.
Forty years from now,

2165
01:43:53,780 --> 01:43:58,780
some fucking dude in a spaceship is 
going to turn some other dude in a 

2166
01:43:58,780 --> 01:44:00,890
spaceship onto whole lot of love.
Probably not 40 years.

2167
01:44:00,891 --> 01:44:03,470
We'll still be stuck on this planet for 
100 years from now.

2168
01:44:03,590 --> 01:44:08,590
That shouldn't be like Mozart.
No one's going to remember pop up poker 

2169
01:44:08,590 --> 01:44:08,590
face.
I,

2170
01:44:08,590 --> 01:44:09,740
you remember that right?
Why don't you agree?

2171
01:44:09,950 --> 01:44:11,660
I know it's pretty big song.

2172
01:44:13,450 --> 01:44:16,930
I think you've just hating on the APP.
You liked that song.

2173
01:44:17,230 --> 01:44:20,200
I think it was okay at the beginning,
but I mean the main thing that,

2174
01:44:20,250 --> 01:44:21,610
who cares about me?
That's like my number,

2175
01:44:21,670 --> 01:44:22,950
a number one song,
you know,

2176
01:44:23,350 --> 01:44:25,150
not every song is number one.
You know?

2177
01:44:26,580 --> 01:44:28,270
Um,
what about what people remember it?

2178
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:30,370
I don't know.
I think that sounds horrible.

2179
01:44:31,180 --> 01:44:32,350
Does anybody here?
I mean,

2180
01:44:32,860 --> 01:44:34,240
Lady Gaga,
she's not bad.

2181
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:35,200
She.

2182
01:44:37,350 --> 01:44:38,760
Yeah.
This dude is down,

2183
01:44:38,761 --> 01:44:43,761
man.
Kevin Newcomb knows what the fuck I'm 

2184
01:44:43,761 --> 01:44:43,761
talking about.
This is there.

2185
01:44:43,761 --> 01:44:43,761
The best music,
the allman brothers.

2186
01:44:43,761 --> 01:44:47,830
Just soulful man.
There's something about those.

2187
01:44:48,150 --> 01:44:52,440
When Joey Diaz describes it as the best,
those dirty motherfucking white boys.

2188
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:55,380
Dirty white boys from Florida.
Are you fucking kidding me?

2189
01:44:55,381 --> 01:44:59,640
Getting that pure heroin able.
Are you fucking kidding me?

2190
01:44:59,641 --> 01:45:01,860
They will play in the real music.
Joe Rogan.

2191
01:45:01,910 --> 01:45:04,560
You gotta get your ideas on ideas will 
be here next week.

2192
01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:09,590
We're going to drag them in here next 
week even if we have to change the 

2193
01:45:09,590 --> 01:45:12,561
schedule for the show and do it at a 
different time right now because I 

2194
01:45:12,561 --> 01:45:14,220
didn't look at this at all the last time
we did this.

2195
01:45:14,221 --> 01:45:16,070
I have to look at it now.
Yeah.

2196
01:45:16,370 --> 01:45:21,370
I made a post on my message board asking
people to put in questions.

2197
01:45:22,410 --> 01:45:27,410
So uh,
because of that I'm going to go there 

2198
01:45:27,410 --> 01:45:29,511
right now and check it out what the 
questions are and see if anybody has 

2199
01:45:29,511 --> 01:45:32,751
some cool shit because people were upset
that I did it last week.

2200
01:45:33,270 --> 01:45:35,550
But when I did it last week I didn't 
answer any questions.

2201
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,220
But I mean,
I like the questions and I,

2202
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:44,250
it's good to have the questions,
but I wanted to make this as loose as 

2203
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:48,081
possible.
I want to make this as much as whatever 

2204
01:45:48,081 --> 01:45:48,081
we feel are talking about,
you know,

2205
01:45:48,081 --> 01:45:48,081
whatever,
whoever's here,

2206
01:45:48,081 --> 01:45:50,550
whatever,
just let things come out,

2207
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:55,880
you know,
and answer twitter questions and all 

2208
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:55,880
that shit.

2209
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:59,380
What are the best tips for navigating a 
high dose mushroom trip?

2210
01:45:59,830 --> 01:46:02,350
Are you doing them regularly?
I was the first question.

2211
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:06,310
I don't do them regularly.
I'm Terence Mckenna,

2212
01:46:06,311 --> 01:46:09,640
who I learned everything I know about 
psychedelics from that guy,

2213
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:14,020
or at least that's where I started 
listening to what he had to say,

2214
01:46:14,021 --> 01:46:19,021
reading his books.
But what he always said is that you 

2215
01:46:19,021 --> 01:46:20,680
should do them in a high doses.
And very rarely,

2216
01:46:20,950 --> 01:46:25,950
that's what he said.
He said that psychedelic experiences 

2217
01:46:25,950 --> 01:46:26,950
shouldn't be something where you do the 
right dose and then you take a long time

2218
01:46:26,951 --> 01:46:29,020
off and try to sort of contemplate what 
happened.

2219
01:46:29,410 --> 01:46:30,940
And uh,
I agree with that.

2220
01:46:31,410 --> 01:46:34,150
The last time I did anything really 
strong like DMT,

2221
01:46:34,151 --> 01:46:37,720
there was over two years ago and it was 
because it was a very,

2222
01:46:37,721 --> 01:46:40,180
very,
very profound experience and I wanted to

2223
01:46:40,181 --> 01:46:45,181
make sure that I got as much out of it 
and they understood it and sort of 

2224
01:46:45,461 --> 01:46:50,461
deciphered it as much as I could and 
applied it to my life as as I could 

2225
01:46:50,461 --> 01:46:51,990
before I just went to try to do it 
again.

2226
01:46:52,010 --> 01:46:57,010
I'm,
I'm very serious about psychedelic 

2227
01:46:57,010 --> 01:46:57,010
trips.
I don't think it's play.

2228
01:46:57,030 --> 01:47:02,030
I mean I think you can have a good time 
of mushrooms with your buddies if you 

2229
01:47:02,030 --> 01:47:04,371
don't take too much,
but I think you can get a lot out of 

2230
01:47:04,371 --> 01:47:06,981
psychedelic trips where you.
And I'm not criticizing people want to 

2231
01:47:06,981 --> 01:47:07,800
do it for fun because look,
I like to drink for fun.

2232
01:47:07,970 --> 01:47:12,970
Smoke pot for funds.
I smoked pot both for introspective 

2233
01:47:12,970 --> 01:47:15,540
quality thinking and also for fun and I 
don't if you want to do it for fun,

2234
01:47:15,541 --> 01:47:18,000
that's all good.
But what I'm saying is like,

2235
01:47:18,210 --> 01:47:23,210
for me personally,
I've learned a lot from psychedelic 

2236
01:47:23,210 --> 01:47:25,720
experiences,
and what I believe is what turns Mckenna

2237
01:47:25,721 --> 01:47:28,650
has always said is that you should do 
them very rarely.

2238
01:47:28,830 --> 01:47:29,430
You do,
um,

2239
01:47:29,490 --> 01:47:34,490
and then you don't do shit for a while 
and you think about what the fuck you 

2240
01:47:34,490 --> 01:47:34,490
learned because it doesn't.

2241
01:47:34,490 --> 01:47:38,950
If you really want to prove yourself,
you really using it for that reason to 

2242
01:47:38,950 --> 01:47:40,980
really expand your consciousness.
You don't get anything out of it.

2243
01:47:40,981 --> 01:47:45,981
If you can't apply it to your life,
you can't just have the experience and 

2244
01:47:45,981 --> 01:47:49,191
then becomes some fucking shut in who 
doesn't interact with the rest of the 

2245
01:47:49,191 --> 01:47:49,191
world.
Because all you want to do is go down in

2246
01:47:49,191 --> 01:47:50,250
your basement,
turn the lights out,

2247
01:47:50,251 --> 01:47:51,780
and do mushrooms,
a curiosity.

2248
01:47:51,810 --> 01:47:53,610
Now you're not even a part of us 
anymore.

2249
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:58,640
Like you should be able to.
You've got to be able to function in 

2250
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:02,181
both worlds,
in the psychedelic world and in this 

2251
01:48:02,181 --> 01:48:05,061
world.
You got to be able to navigate both 

2252
01:48:05,061 --> 01:48:05,580
dimensions.
And I think if you do too much drugs,

2253
01:48:05,581 --> 01:48:06,960
if you do them all the time,
you know,

2254
01:48:06,961 --> 01:48:11,961
you can,
you can definitely lose your handle on 

2255
01:48:11,961 --> 01:48:13,080
this world.
So that's my answer to that question.

2256
01:48:13,110 --> 01:48:18,110
I think if you're,
if you're doing anything consciousness 

2257
01:48:18,110 --> 01:48:18,110
expanding,
you know,

2258
01:48:18,110 --> 01:48:21,840
and always do things that have been done
for thousands and thousands of years.

2259
01:48:21,841 --> 01:48:26,841
I mean,
I'm not telling you to do anything 

2260
01:48:26,841 --> 01:48:28,341
illegal,
but there's stuff that you can do that 

2261
01:48:28,341 --> 01:48:28,341
isn't illegal.
They just haven't classified it yet.

2262
01:48:28,341 --> 01:48:30,330
You know,
Iowasca isn't technically illegal.

2263
01:48:30,331 --> 01:48:35,331
DMT is illegal.
IOWASCA has even been sanctioned 

2264
01:48:35,331 --> 01:48:35,331
recently.
Uh,

2265
01:48:35,331 --> 01:48:35,331
they,
uh,

2266
01:48:35,331 --> 01:48:37,890
some church in New Mexico won a supreme 
court case where they,

2267
01:48:37,891 --> 01:48:39,420
uh,
they take dmt as part of their,

2268
01:48:39,421 --> 01:48:40,770
uh,
their Christian church.

2269
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:43,170
It's part of their religious ceremonies 
to get in touch with God.

2270
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:49,280
Yeah,
they want a supreme court case for few 

2271
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:49,770
people know about it.
But you should know what the fuck you're

2272
01:48:49,771 --> 01:48:54,771
doing.
And that's the real problem with 

2273
01:48:54,771 --> 01:48:54,771
psychedelics is that there are no shaman
anymore.

2274
01:48:54,771 --> 01:48:55,030
You know,
in the,

2275
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:55,840
in,
you know,

2276
01:48:55,860 --> 01:49:00,450
these tribes in Peru and these people 
that live in the Amazon there,

2277
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:05,480
there's like a history of usage that 
goes back thousands of years and they 

2278
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:06,600
pass it on from generation to 
generation.

2279
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:11,600
And the Shaman,
the people that like brew this Iowasca 

2280
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:11,910
Iowasca is very powerful dose of,
uh,

2281
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:17,240
of dmt that comes in an orally active 
form and they get it from combining 

2282
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:20,040
these plants and boiling and into this 
crazy mixture between that.

2283
01:49:20,041 --> 01:49:23,550
And there's also shaman and other parts 
of the world in Mexico where they,

2284
01:49:23,551 --> 01:49:24,300
um,
they,

2285
01:49:24,301 --> 01:49:26,550
they're Sharman where they,
their thing is mushrooms.

2286
01:49:26,730 --> 01:49:29,220
And these are people that have navigated
these dimensions,

2287
01:49:29,221 --> 01:49:31,140
whether it's Iowaska or mushrooms or 
pod.

2288
01:49:31,350 --> 01:49:33,540
They've navigated these dimensions many,
many,

2289
01:49:33,541 --> 01:49:34,350
many,
many times.

2290
01:49:34,351 --> 01:49:35,880
So they can tell you what to expect 
there.

2291
01:49:36,060 --> 01:49:36,790
They can,
they've,

2292
01:49:36,850 --> 01:49:39,570
they've learned from their experiences 
and they can help you.

2293
01:49:40,420 --> 01:49:45,420
You know,
I think that's the real problem is that 

2294
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:45,420
psychedelic drugs aren't necessarily bad
for you.

2295
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:50,031
They're just illegal.
And when they're illegal can be bad for 

2296
01:49:50,031 --> 01:49:50,031
you because if you need car with them 
and get locked up,

2297
01:49:50,170 --> 01:49:53,320
your life can get fucked up if they find
them on your in your purse,

2298
01:49:53,321 --> 01:49:58,321
if you have to test for some sort of a 
job and then all of a sudden you're 

2299
01:49:58,321 --> 01:49:58,321
labeled a drug addict.

2300
01:49:58,321 --> 01:50:02,550
Yeah.
And that sense psychedelic drugs can be 

2301
01:50:02,550 --> 01:50:03,370
bad.
And the other sense it's like a circular

2302
01:50:03,371 --> 01:50:05,890
saw like one those,
those are awesome.

2303
01:50:05,891 --> 01:50:08,230
If you know how to use one,
you can build a house,

2304
01:50:08,231 --> 01:50:10,150
you could,
you could fucking do some cool shit.

2305
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:15,360
You can cut some wood that you would 
never be able to cut with like a steak 

2306
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:18,481
knife.
But it doesn't mean everybody should 

2307
01:50:18,481 --> 01:50:19,090
have a fucking circular saw and just be 
using it all day.

2308
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:20,980
And that's the same thing with 
mushrooms.

2309
01:50:21,160 --> 01:50:24,520
Mushrooms are just like any kind of tool
you can like.

2310
01:50:24,550 --> 01:50:25,600
Like I said,
with marijuana,

2311
01:50:25,630 --> 01:50:30,630
with a hammer,
you can build a house with a hammer or 

2312
01:50:30,630 --> 01:50:30,630
you can just hit yourself in the deck if
you're fucking crazy.

2313
01:50:30,630 --> 01:50:31,750
It doesn't mean that hammer should be 
illegal.

2314
01:50:31,930 --> 01:50:33,670
And that's the same thing with 
psychedelic drugs.

2315
01:50:33,671 --> 01:50:36,190
I wouldn't give a circular saw to a 13 
year old boy and say,

2316
01:50:36,191 --> 01:50:37,630
Hey,
go play with this.

2317
01:50:37,750 --> 01:50:42,750
But if a guy is a goddamn carpenter and 
he knows what he's doing and he's Kinda 

2318
01:50:42,750 --> 01:50:44,050
gone up through trade school and you 
know,

2319
01:50:44,051 --> 01:50:49,051
it didn't apprenticeship and worked as a
carpenter's apprentice and learned how 

2320
01:50:49,051 --> 01:50:50,710
to use tools properly and learn the 
proper safety precautions,

2321
01:50:50,830 --> 01:50:55,830
then yeah,
that guy should be able to hold a 

2322
01:50:55,830 --> 01:50:57,271
fucking chainsaw.
That guy should be able to use a 

2323
01:50:57,271 --> 01:50:59,161
circular saw.
That guy should be able to work in a 

2324
01:50:59,161 --> 01:50:59,161
machine shop.
He's learned how to do it.

2325
01:50:59,161 --> 01:51:00,220
And that's the same thing with 
psychedelic drugs.

2326
01:51:00,221 --> 01:51:05,221
There should be someone showing you the 
dangers and the pitfalls and what it's 

2327
01:51:05,221 --> 01:51:05,890
all about because it's not simply that 
easy.

2328
01:51:05,891 --> 01:51:07,870
It's not like you can just do them and 
you're going to be okay.

2329
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:12,280
Some people do psychedelic drugs and 
there's so unmentally prepared for it,

2330
01:51:12,281 --> 01:51:13,870
but they're never the same again.
You know?

2331
01:51:13,870 --> 01:51:18,870
And that's a real possibility and 
someone needs to be there to evaluate 

2332
01:51:18,870 --> 01:51:18,870
whether or not,
you know,

2333
01:51:18,870 --> 01:51:21,100
you've got the proper information with 
your head's in the right place,

2334
01:51:21,250 --> 01:51:21,740
you know,
and that,

2335
01:51:21,741 --> 01:51:24,520
that's why it would help if we were more
open about these fucking things.

2336
01:51:24,700 --> 01:51:29,700
And it's the nutty thing is it's,
it's still got this terrible reputation 

2337
01:51:29,700 --> 01:51:29,710
and here we are,
you know,

2338
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:34,800
in 2010.
And I think the reputation is all based 

2339
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:36,160
on the fact that we,
when we get something in our head,

2340
01:51:36,161 --> 01:51:38,110
we stick with it and we get something in
our head.

2341
01:51:38,111 --> 01:51:40,660
Even with all the information,
like marijuana is still illegal,

2342
01:51:40,780 --> 01:51:43,720
2010 and most states it's illegal,
you know,

2343
01:51:44,110 --> 01:51:48,580
it's crazy when alcohol and tobacco and 
all that shit is readily available.

2344
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:51,370
But we get it in our head that it's bad 
because it's been illegal.

2345
01:51:51,371 --> 01:51:56,371
All our lives were.
It's a very tough for us to change 

2346
01:51:56,371 --> 01:51:56,371
gears.

2347
01:51:56,371 --> 01:51:59,200
And for a long time we've had this thing
in our head about psychedelic drugs.

2348
01:51:59,530 --> 01:52:01,900
And uh,
it's just a cultural pattern,

2349
01:52:02,140 --> 01:52:03,280
you know,
it's just a lock.

2350
01:52:03,281 --> 01:52:08,281
We got talked into it when the media was
young and when the newspapers were 

2351
01:52:08,281 --> 01:52:08,690
around and that was the only way to get 
information.

2352
01:52:08,700 --> 01:52:13,000
Now they would publish these stories 
about marijuana and the William Randolph

2353
01:52:13,001 --> 01:52:18,001
hearst scandals with William Randolph 
hearst owned not only deedee own 

2354
01:52:18,001 --> 01:52:22,110
newspapers,
but he also owned paper mills and when 

2355
01:52:22,110 --> 01:52:24,541
they invented the decorticator,
it made it more effective to process 

2356
01:52:24,541 --> 01:52:28,621
hemp fiber and what he started doing was
attacking the hemp industry so that he 

2357
01:52:28,621 --> 01:52:32,500
didn't have to change over his paper 
mills from wood to hemp paper,

2358
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:36,160
because hemp is a far superior paper.
It makes superior clothing.

2359
01:52:36,390 --> 01:52:38,790
It's you.
You can eat it like the is.

2360
01:52:39,210 --> 01:52:44,210
It contains all the essential amino 
acids and the seeds besides the fact 

2361
01:52:44,210 --> 01:52:44,680
that it gets you high,
even take away.

2362
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:49,680
That gets you high part.
Even the plants that don't get you high 

2363
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:50,600
at all or still like really economically
viable,

2364
01:52:50,660 --> 01:52:55,660
valuable.
Well we'll we'll you ran off first 

2365
01:52:55,660 --> 01:52:55,660
attack that industry because you own the
newspapers.

2366
01:52:55,700 --> 01:53:00,700
He started printing these stories saying
that blacks and Mexicans were swept 

2367
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:04,070
smoking this new drug called marijuana 
and they were going out and raping white

2368
01:53:04,071 --> 01:53:06,620
women.
And so because of that,

2369
01:53:06,621 --> 01:53:07,940
because he did this,
they all,

2370
01:53:07,941 --> 01:53:08,830
um,
you know,

2371
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:13,840
people got crazy and they'll pat got 
paranoid and congress actually outlawed 

2372
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:15,980
marijuana not even knowing that they 
were outlawing hemp.

2373
01:53:16,190 --> 01:53:17,510
They didn't even know it was the same 
thing.

2374
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:23,380
So that's,
that's how marijuana became illegal in 

2375
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:25,931
the first place.
And that's why it's still illegal today 

2376
01:53:25,931 --> 01:53:25,931
is at once something is stuck in our 
consciousness.

2377
01:53:25,931 --> 01:53:27,530
It takes a long time to get it out.
Well,

2378
01:53:27,531 --> 01:53:30,260
I think that a long time ago,
a long time ago,

2379
01:53:30,290 --> 01:53:35,290
it was probably very,
very common in all cultures to have a 

2380
01:53:35,290 --> 01:53:36,240
shaman,
to have some sort of a,

2381
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:41,440
you know,
someone who is aware of psychedelic 

2382
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:41,440
states,
you know,

2383
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:42,440
John,
Marco Allegro,

2384
01:53:42,441 --> 01:53:47,441
uh,
he argues that that's what Christianity 

2385
01:53:47,441 --> 01:53:47,441
is all about.

2386
01:53:47,441 --> 01:53:50,410
Christianity is all about concealing 
these secrets of consuming 

2387
01:53:50,410 --> 01:53:53,770
hallucinogenic drugs.
He was the guy who decided for the Dead 

2388
01:53:53,770 --> 01:53:53,770
Sea Scrolls.
John Mark or allegro,

2389
01:53:53,770 --> 01:53:55,520
worked in the Dead Sea Scrolls for 14 
years.

2390
01:53:55,730 --> 01:54:00,730
And after he did all this discovery,
now I don't know if he's right and 

2391
01:54:00,730 --> 01:54:00,730
neither of you,
unless you're a biblical scholar,

2392
01:54:00,730 --> 01:54:01,520
unless you can,
you know,

2393
01:54:01,521 --> 01:54:03,950
you have to be a,
a master of ancient languages.

2394
01:54:03,951 --> 01:54:08,951
You have to study it for decades.
Even understand what the fuck he's 

2395
01:54:08,951 --> 01:54:08,951
talking about.
I read it,

2396
01:54:08,951 --> 01:54:11,180
it's like make sense sort of,
but it could be totally bullshitting.

2397
01:54:11,420 --> 01:54:16,420
But what his story is was that the 
entire Christian religion was a giant 

2398
01:54:16,420 --> 01:54:20,831
misunderstanding.
What it really was all about was the 

2399
01:54:20,831 --> 01:54:22,040
consumption of psychedelic mushrooms and
fertility cults.

2400
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:27,280
And that's what it was all about.
It was all about breeding babies and 

2401
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:27,280
taking mushrooms,
which makes sense.

2402
01:54:27,350 --> 01:54:32,350
People live thousands and thousands of 
years ago and didn't know what the sky 

2403
01:54:32,350 --> 01:54:32,630
was.
They didn't have any science and they're

2404
01:54:32,631 --> 01:54:33,680
popping mushrooms.
They would.

2405
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:36,470
They wouldn't want other people to know 
how bad ass the mushrooms are.

2406
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:38,000
You eat mushrooms,
you see God.

2407
01:54:38,030 --> 01:54:39,380
It wouldn't want other people to know 
about that.

2408
01:54:39,381 --> 01:54:41,390
So they would hide it in stories.
I told them make sense?

2409
01:54:43,870 --> 01:54:45,550
Some guy said,
I've been tried robitussin.

2410
01:54:46,730 --> 01:54:49,800
What are you kidding?
Do Caucus Powell drinking robitussin?

2411
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:51,790
What else?
Dragon Aftershave,

2412
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:56,800
Phil agreed,
discusses,

2413
01:54:57,150 --> 01:54:59,640
hates everything in the radio.
I don't hate everything on the radio,

2414
01:54:59,641 --> 01:55:01,380
but Goddamn,
I had a lot of songs.

2415
01:55:02,490 --> 01:55:07,490
I think there's just a certain reality 
and it was like a lot of rap and a lot 

2416
01:55:07,490 --> 01:55:08,850
of classic rock.
I like soundgarden too.

2417
01:55:08,851 --> 01:55:13,851
I love sound garden.
I heard they're getting back together 

2418
01:55:13,851 --> 01:55:15,741
again,
which I love because I was not a fan of 

2419
01:55:15,741 --> 01:55:15,741
that.
Chris Cornell Shit I was on.

2420
01:55:15,790 --> 01:55:17,350
Yeah.
Lately I haven't been a fan.

2421
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:21,270
He seems like a really cool guy and he's
a talented as fuck as a singer,

2422
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:24,440
but there's like some bands that get 
together.

2423
01:55:24,470 --> 01:55:25,890
They got to a magic,
you know?

2424
01:55:26,030 --> 01:55:28,010
I don't think it.
Even if they get back together,

2425
01:55:28,011 --> 01:55:29,610
I don't think it's going to be that 
character willing.

2426
01:55:29,611 --> 01:55:30,380
Yeah,
I think.

2427
01:55:30,381 --> 01:55:34,160
I think a lot of bands like soundgarden,
they were good because they were a young

2428
01:55:34,161 --> 01:55:38,420
and every eight doing drugs and going 
crazy and just experiencing life now.

2429
01:55:38,421 --> 01:55:40,760
I think these are just people that have 
slowed down,

2430
01:55:40,761 --> 01:55:44,300
slowed their role and they're trying to 
be something or because their music.

2431
01:55:44,300 --> 01:55:49,300
Just a lot of these guys as music or I 
think that was kind of what I was 

2432
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:53,871
talking about earlier when I was saying 
that there's a certain level that you 

2433
01:55:53,871 --> 01:55:54,780
reach as a,
I'm a performer,

2434
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:56,550
you know,
if you get too famous,

2435
01:55:56,551 --> 01:55:58,740
you get too successful.
It's very hard to,

2436
01:55:58,860 --> 01:56:00,270
to,
to cope.

2437
01:56:00,700 --> 01:56:04,380
Very hard to be still creative and still
have enthusiasm.

2438
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:06,750
I mean,
how many guys just get better and better

2439
01:56:06,751 --> 01:56:10,150
every album.
It's not that many know stereo.

2440
01:56:10,230 --> 01:56:15,230
Hard to pull off.
Who Do you think has ever done it the 

2441
01:56:15,230 --> 01:56:15,230
longest?
Most consistently.

2442
01:56:16,210 --> 01:56:18,690
Wells that blend.
One of those guys,

2443
01:56:18,691 --> 01:56:20,790
probably the Beatles did it forever.
Right?

2444
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:23,460
Did they ever fall apart?
They got better,

2445
01:56:23,490 --> 01:56:25,670
right?
Yeah,

2446
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:28,080
they did.
They got into their psychedelic stage,

2447
01:56:28,081 --> 01:56:30,420
you know,
they're fucking white album stage,

2448
01:56:31,390 --> 01:56:36,390
better beatles rock band.
It's great because he started off like 

2449
01:56:36,390 --> 01:56:36,390
Shitty Beatles songs and you're just 
like,

2450
01:56:36,390 --> 01:56:41,150
this sucks or whatever,
and then you start getting into like 

2451
01:56:41,150 --> 01:56:41,150
psychedelic and it's just,
it's cool.

2452
01:56:41,340 --> 01:56:44,170
The more you play the more into the 
music scene.

2453
01:56:44,190 --> 01:56:46,620
The thing about the Beatles was they 
didn't just change their music.

2454
01:56:46,621 --> 01:56:50,250
They changed the whole culture that was 
listening to them too because people got

2455
01:56:50,251 --> 01:56:55,251
swept up in their music.
People were such huge fans of John 

2456
01:56:55,251 --> 01:56:58,930
Lennon and when he started getting into 
transcendental meditation and acid and 

2457
01:56:58,930 --> 01:56:59,130
you know,
hanging out with gurus and shit,

2458
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:04,160
they hold onto it too.
Like he changed a lot of people's 

2459
01:57:04,160 --> 01:57:04,160
consciousness.

2460
01:57:04,160 --> 01:57:07,940
That was a guy that really,
really affected a lot of the way our 

2461
01:57:07,940 --> 01:57:12,021
culture operates,
the way people think about Michael 

2462
01:57:12,021 --> 01:57:12,021
Jackson to fuck you.
Yeah.

2463
01:57:12,021 --> 01:57:12,780
Yeah.
Michael Jackson.

2464
01:57:12,781 --> 01:57:13,800
Just from the,
the,

2465
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:19,040
the music,
like how powerful it was like bad and 

2466
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:19,230
thriller,
man when I was a kid,

2467
01:57:19,231 --> 01:57:21,510
there was nothing that was more popular 
than that.

2468
01:57:21,770 --> 01:57:26,770
It's like it was so recognized that his 
talent was just so far and above 

2469
01:57:26,770 --> 01:57:27,630
everyone else's.
And you know,

2470
01:57:27,631 --> 01:57:28,410
everybody's like,
God.

2471
01:57:28,411 --> 01:57:30,450
It's so sad that he's such a freak and 
he's so crazy.

2472
01:57:30,630 --> 01:57:35,630
But the more I've been thinking lately,
I think that when you get to a certain 

2473
01:57:36,271 --> 01:57:38,700
level,
I think there's a certain level of,

2474
01:57:38,780 --> 01:57:43,780
um,
of greatness that some people achieve 

2475
01:57:43,780 --> 01:57:47,091
like a certain frequency that some 
people cheap and it's almost impossible 

2476
01:57:47,091 --> 01:57:47,091
to achieve.
If you're not insane,

2477
01:57:47,091 --> 01:57:52,070
it's almost impossible to push yourself 
that far that hard because it's not easy

2478
01:57:52,531 --> 01:57:53,880
to be like Michael Jackson.

2479
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:57,570
It's so fucking hard.
It's not just natural talent.

2480
01:57:57,600 --> 01:58:02,600
It's a focus and an energy and that 
focus requires like a very singular way 

2481
01:58:03,481 --> 01:58:08,481
of looking at things in a very essential
question by sexual abuse and that 

2482
01:58:08,941 --> 01:58:10,860
probably helps to relax in the back of 
his.

2483
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:12,450
What do you think that's what happened 
with him?

2484
01:58:12,451 --> 01:58:14,580
You think it was when I was a kid,
I think probably.

2485
01:58:14,690 --> 01:58:15,330
I mean,
well,

2486
01:58:15,331 --> 01:58:16,840
it's all speculation.
They all were.

2487
01:58:17,270 --> 01:58:22,270
He could have been that.
He just got so fucked up because he got 

2488
01:58:22,270 --> 01:58:25,281
so famous when he was so young that he 
never felt like he had a chance to grow 

2489
01:58:25,281 --> 01:58:29,031
up and he wanted to go back to when he 
was a child and it was just so 

2490
01:58:29,031 --> 01:58:31,851
psychologically damaged that he 
literally wanted to be around children 

2491
01:58:31,851 --> 01:58:35,900
because he wanted to revert back to that
moment in his life before he realized 

2492
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:35,900
that life was haywire.

2493
01:58:36,190 --> 01:58:41,190
You know?
I've thought that before because you 

2494
01:58:41,190 --> 01:58:43,041
know what the thing is about all these 
child molesting accusations is that he 

2495
01:58:43,041 --> 01:58:47,641
was always around all these poor kids 
and trying to help all these kids with 

2496
01:58:47,641 --> 01:58:49,680
cancer and shit and people were who were
broke and it's like after awhile,

2497
01:58:49,780 --> 01:58:54,780
I mean these people,
like all they have to do is say some 

2498
01:58:54,780 --> 01:58:55,930
crazy shit about Michael Jackson and you
know,

2499
01:58:55,931 --> 01:59:00,931
it looks weird.
Why is my Jackson hanging out with kids 

2500
01:59:00,931 --> 01:59:03,151
all the time?
I would say some crazy shit and he's 

2501
01:59:03,151 --> 01:59:05,191
gotta pay you gotta pay.
You start going through the newspaper 

2502
01:59:05,191 --> 01:59:05,191
and to these people that were super 
broke.

2503
01:59:05,191 --> 01:59:06,400
I mean,
that'd be so tempting.

2504
01:59:06,550 --> 01:59:11,550
Here's this billionaire,
the biggest rockstar music star and the 

2505
01:59:11,550 --> 01:59:13,060
history of the world and he's hanging 
out with your kid.

2506
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:18,280
He's a kid.
Your kid over for sleepovers and you 

2507
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:18,280
start.

2508
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:18,280
I believe it though in some I've paid 
him

2509
01:59:18,530 --> 01:59:23,530
the.
What I'm saying is there's not like a 

2510
01:59:23,530 --> 01:59:23,530
whole bunch of people coming out saying 
he fucked up.

2511
01:59:23,530 --> 01:59:27,660
You want to just fuck a couple of kids.
You'd be fucking kids all over the 

2512
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:27,660
place.
Especially if you're Michael Jackson.

2513
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:29,300
You'd be like the tiger woods of kid 
fucking.

2514
01:59:29,570 --> 01:59:31,580
You'd be just banging kids all over the 
place.

2515
01:59:31,700 --> 01:59:35,150
You would if you got that obsession 
where you want to have sex with kids.

2516
01:59:35,660 --> 01:59:40,660
If you look at like trauma masters,
like the recidivism rate is through the 

2517
01:59:40,660 --> 01:59:40,660
roof.
It's crazy.

2518
01:59:40,660 --> 01:59:41,810
It's like a 99 percent or something like
that.

2519
01:59:41,811 --> 01:59:42,680
I don't know.
It's real.

2520
01:59:42,770 --> 01:59:44,330
I just made that number up.
It's real high though.

2521
01:59:44,360 --> 01:59:45,440
Whatever it is.
I've read it.

2522
01:59:45,650 --> 01:59:50,650
I don't remember what the numbers are,
but the people have said time and time 

2523
01:59:50,650 --> 01:59:50,960
again,
it's very difficult to reform someone,

2524
01:59:51,230 --> 01:59:55,670
so if he's like banging kids,
he's not just going to bang one or two,

2525
01:59:55,720 --> 02:00:00,720
but that's why he had kids and he called
the kid blanket because he's always on 

2526
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:00,720
top of him.

2527
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:01,190
That's bullshit.

2528
02:00:03,210 --> 02:00:08,210
Seriously though.
I mean if you're a child molester and 

2529
02:00:08,210 --> 02:00:08,210
you get caught,
what don't you have kids?

2530
02:00:08,210 --> 02:00:08,870
You're just get enough money.
Yeah,

2531
02:00:08,871 --> 02:00:09,040
but

2532
02:00:09,610 --> 02:00:14,610
no,
none of his kids have ever come out and 

2533
02:00:14,610 --> 02:00:14,610
accused him of doing that.
You can't just say that you're just,

2534
02:00:14,610 --> 02:00:16,890
you're adding on now you're making.
I'm not saying it's true.

2535
02:00:16,950 --> 02:00:21,950
I'm just saying,
but I'm going to say that's what I 

2536
02:00:21,950 --> 02:00:21,950
believe in.
I don't believe me.

2537
02:00:21,950 --> 02:00:23,160
I believe that he probably slept with 
kids,

2538
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:26,150
but I don't think he's like,
fuck,

2539
02:00:26,190 --> 02:00:31,190
you know,
like doggy style on the side of the bed 

2540
02:00:31,190 --> 02:00:33,561
or anything like that.
So you think he just did inappropriate 

2541
02:00:33,561 --> 02:00:33,561
shit?
I bet he's just because he thinks he's a

2542
02:00:33,561 --> 02:00:33,800
kid.
You know?

2543
02:00:33,880 --> 02:00:37,380
Maybe I was molested by his father 
growing up.

2544
02:00:38,040 --> 02:00:43,040
That would cause.
I mean Miley Cyrus would be fucking 

2545
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:43,450
black by now if that was true.
Yeah.

2546
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:45,430
Somebody said this.
I don't know who said this,

2547
02:00:45,431 --> 02:00:47,890
but I don't want to not give them 
credit,

2548
02:00:47,891 --> 02:00:52,891
but I don't remember who it was.
They said that they think that Michael 

2549
02:00:52,891 --> 02:00:53,860
Jackson might've been castrated.
They think that at certain point in time

2550
02:00:53,990 --> 02:00:58,990
Michael Jackson might've been castrated 
and that's why he can sing at such a 

2551
02:00:58,990 --> 02:01:00,240
high pitch,
even though he's a grown man.

2552
02:01:00,280 --> 02:01:03,880
That might be why so fucked up sexually 
and it totally makes sense.

2553
02:01:03,970 --> 02:01:05,380
Especially when you look at his 
children.

2554
02:01:05,410 --> 02:01:06,610
Those are not his children.
I mean,

2555
02:01:06,611 --> 02:01:09,610
there were white kids there,
100 percent white and he's a black man.

2556
02:01:09,850 --> 02:01:12,280
I mean he might've paid for someone to 
have those kids for them,

2557
02:01:12,281 --> 02:01:14,020
but they're not as kids,
you know,

2558
02:01:14,260 --> 02:01:17,230
and I think that it's real possible 
that,

2559
02:01:17,231 --> 02:01:19,230
that that's real possible,
but it's special

2560
02:01:19,250 --> 02:01:21,520
culation Janet and all them,
all kinds of hair,

2561
02:01:21,521 --> 02:01:22,820
that kind of voice.
You know,

2562
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:24,750
Tito doesn't.
Jermaine doesn't.

2563
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:26,620
Those are men.
You look at his brother,

2564
02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:29,120
those are men.
Unless he's like some sort of a,

2565
02:01:29,330 --> 02:01:31,900
a biological freak.
Why does he have that voice?

2566
02:01:31,901 --> 02:01:34,630
Why is he looked like that?
Why is he so feminine?

2567
02:01:34,660 --> 02:01:37,600
Why is his voice so high pitched?
Even though he's a grown man?

2568
02:01:37,750 --> 02:01:39,680
I mean,
could you imagine would if.

2569
02:01:39,820 --> 02:01:44,820
What if?
I mean he's so crazy with his fucking 

2570
02:01:44,820 --> 02:01:47,801
plastic surgery.
What if he had some bad sexual 

2571
02:01:47,801 --> 02:01:48,200
experiences when he was younger and he 
just decided to Castro himself?

2572
02:01:49,590 --> 02:01:51,510
I mean,
you look at what he does to his face.

2573
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:56,010
That's not beyond the realm of question.
I'm just making a fucking rumors.

2574
02:01:57,230 --> 02:02:00,720
Two hours and five minutes and this to 
the goddamn rumors show.

2575
02:02:00,721 --> 02:02:03,660
Folks,
what does that,

2576
02:02:03,930 --> 02:02:06,780
this is my anger to one of these twitter
posters.

2577
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:08,880
I love those guys.
I just to get math,

2578
02:02:09,020 --> 02:02:11,550
there's like those guys that just trying
to get your tag.

2579
02:02:11,640 --> 02:02:13,500
Look at me,
look at me like every five posts.

2580
02:02:13,501 --> 02:02:14,310
It's the same guy.

2581
02:02:14,580 --> 02:02:16,550
Australian men can't get hard,
man.

2582
02:02:16,820 --> 02:02:18,230
Oh,
can get hard man.

2583
02:02:18,550 --> 02:02:20,000
Uh,
they can trust me.

2584
02:02:20,001 --> 02:02:20,890
I know.
It's funny.

2585
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:24,350
I thought that was the whole point.
Castrating people,

2586
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:27,780
unless you take like you have to take 
Viagra or some.

2587
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:28,530
How do you,
how do you.

2588
02:02:28,780 --> 02:02:33,780
Does anybody know this?
Are there any dick experts out there on 

2589
02:02:33,780 --> 02:02:33,780
the twitter?
Ladies and gentlemen,

2590
02:02:33,780 --> 02:02:38,440
please give me some information.
Can you really get a hard on after 

2591
02:02:38,440 --> 02:02:39,620
Castro did?
Not by natural means,

2592
02:02:39,621 --> 02:02:40,610
right?
You have to take something.

2593
02:02:40,950 --> 02:02:43,490
It seems like when the balls are whacked
out,

2594
02:02:43,491 --> 02:02:46,100
that's a rap song.
That's a rug son.

2595
02:02:46,660 --> 02:02:48,170
So wrap,
son.

2596
02:02:51,350 --> 02:02:55,370
I'm glad you guys are enjoying the JPG 
for ps zero.

2597
02:02:56,120 --> 02:02:57,410
This is fun.
It's fun for me too,

2598
02:02:57,411 --> 02:02:57,980
man.
What?

2599
02:02:57,981 --> 02:02:59,810
I banged a 16 year old.
No Man.

2600
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:03,380
Listen,
you know they look hot.

2601
02:03:03,381 --> 02:03:05,090
That's a problem.
And they're ready to fuck.

2602
02:03:05,150 --> 02:03:06,320
They really are,
you know,

2603
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:07,790
teenagers.
I mean,

2604
02:03:07,791 --> 02:03:11,240
I'm not saying anybody should fuck them,
but when you see a girl,

2605
02:03:11,260 --> 02:03:13,100
like when I was 16,
when I was 16,

2606
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:18,280
I was having sex weren't you?
I was having sex and my girlfriend was 

2607
02:03:18,651 --> 02:03:21,560
15 and she was built like a woman to a 
woman.

2608
02:03:21,561 --> 02:03:26,561
She had Turks and she had a big ass and 
it was a woman and she wanted sex all 

2609
02:03:26,561 --> 02:03:26,630
the time.
I mean,

2610
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:28,940
that's a,
that shit is real.

2611
02:03:29,180 --> 02:03:31,220
You know what I mean?
That's,

2612
02:03:31,310 --> 02:03:34,730
but you're not supposed to deal it.
Doug Stanhope as a joke about it.

2613
02:03:34,740 --> 02:03:36,550
Me and uh,
Brian,

2614
02:03:36,580 --> 02:03:41,580
uh,
me and a are ever talking about it on 

2615
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:41,580
the plane already told me the joke that 
Doug said,

2616
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:42,670
and apparently Doug said,
you know,

2617
02:03:42,860 --> 02:03:47,860
you know,
you say that data that they're 16 years 

2618
02:03:47,860 --> 02:03:47,860
old,
they shouldn't be having babies.

2619
02:03:47,860 --> 02:03:49,070
Well guess what?
God disagrees.

2620
02:03:49,400 --> 02:03:52,790
That's why they can get pregnant.
And that's a really good point.

2621
02:03:53,420 --> 02:03:54,080
You know,
I mean,

2622
02:03:54,081 --> 02:03:55,310
that's really true.
But no,

2623
02:03:55,311 --> 02:03:57,320
I wouldn't have sex with a 16 year old.
That's a child,

2624
02:03:57,620 --> 02:03:58,930
you know.
I mean,

2625
02:03:59,330 --> 02:04:04,010
even if a girl is like 20,
like I'm 40 fucking two years old,

2626
02:04:04,130 --> 02:04:09,130
like I've heard of dudes that are like 
my age that have like 20 year old 

2627
02:04:09,130 --> 02:04:09,130
girlfriends and everybody laughs about 
it.

2628
02:04:09,130 --> 02:04:09,690
Like,
well look at that guy he's got,

2629
02:04:09,910 --> 02:04:12,560
have a buddy that has a wife and his 
wife's 19,

2630
02:04:12,950 --> 02:04:14,510
you know,
and he's in his forties.

2631
02:04:14,780 --> 02:04:16,970
It's crazy.
But you know what?

2632
02:04:17,090 --> 02:04:18,110
That's them.
The,

2633
02:04:18,120 --> 02:04:18,720
they,
they,

2634
02:04:18,721 --> 02:04:20,240
they like it and they have a good time 
to.

2635
02:04:20,390 --> 02:04:23,810
I have a hard time talking to people,
you know,

2636
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:28,840
I can't.
I mean if I'm living with someone they 

2637
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:28,840
have to be smart.
I'm,

2638
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:29,570
I need someone who has some experience.

2639
02:04:30,410 --> 02:04:35,410
You have to be on the same level as me.
And there's something that you denied 

2640
02:04:35,410 --> 02:04:37,800
when you're younger but you realize when
you get older is that when you fuck,

2641
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:42,920
when you have sex with someone,
even though you like to think that it's 

2642
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:46,221
just physical,
you just getting there and you blow a 

2643
02:04:46,221 --> 02:04:46,221
lobe.
It's not that simple.

2644
02:04:46,221 --> 02:04:50,370
There is some sort of a weird connection
that human beings make when they fuck.

2645
02:04:51,250 --> 02:04:54,360
And especially when you do it to someone
who's young,

2646
02:04:54,510 --> 02:04:59,510
like they,
we learn how to ignore that connection 

2647
02:04:59,510 --> 02:05:02,671
and we learned how to like push each 
other away when a little older we 

2648
02:05:02,671 --> 02:05:03,240
learned how to separate and get,
you know,

2649
02:05:03,241 --> 02:05:06,040
just deal with it about physically.
But when you're young,

2650
02:05:06,041 --> 02:05:11,041
like you get so attached,
you remember how attached to her the 

2651
02:05:11,041 --> 02:05:11,041
first person you had sex with,
Holy Shit.

2652
02:05:11,041 --> 02:05:13,350
Unless that person's a total douche bag,
you know,

2653
02:05:13,351 --> 02:05:15,480
like you,
like it really like hooked on them.

2654
02:05:15,690 --> 02:05:18,000
Like puppy love is brutal,
you know,

2655
02:05:18,060 --> 02:05:23,060
and that that's what they call a.
you're inexperienced in the incredible 

2656
02:05:23,060 --> 02:05:24,750
connection and you as you get older,
you learn how to manage that connection.

2657
02:05:24,751 --> 02:05:29,751
But the connection is real.
And if you're a grown adult and you 

2658
02:05:29,751 --> 02:05:30,640
know,
you're,

2659
02:05:31,650 --> 02:05:34,010
especially if you're in a position to 
take advantage of this kid,

2660
02:05:34,050 --> 02:05:39,050
you know,
they're young and naive and silly and 

2661
02:05:39,050 --> 02:05:39,120
you're fucking them.
That's a weird thing,

2662
02:05:39,210 --> 02:05:41,310
you know.
Then again,

2663
02:05:41,311 --> 02:05:44,040
a lot of 20 year olds are Horny as fuck 
or they want them to.

2664
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,100
I'm not telling you what to do,
do whatever you want to do.

2665
02:05:47,730 --> 02:05:50,480
But to me not,
you know,

2666
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:52,980
girls 18,
that's like a baby to me,

2667
02:05:53,170 --> 02:05:55,620
it's as a little child.
I like women,

2668
02:05:55,900 --> 02:05:57,000
you know,
I don't like.

2669
02:05:57,001 --> 02:05:57,450
I'm old.

2670
02:05:59,630 --> 02:06:04,470
I don't even like a my urge,
but it's women are more fun.

2671
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:06,480
I like to be able to talk to people.
Don't you?

2672
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:10,380
Some dude,
Josh Jitsu says I'm 23.

2673
02:06:10,650 --> 02:06:11,490
Well,
good for you.

2674
02:06:11,491 --> 02:06:14,070
You young little whipper snapper.
When I was 23,

2675
02:06:14,071 --> 02:06:16,500
I was fucking retarded,
right?

2676
02:06:16,501 --> 02:06:20,610
I was a complete and total dumb ass.
So I hope you were smarter than me sir.

2677
02:06:21,300 --> 02:06:23,820
Because a life can be tough when you're 
stupid,

2678
02:06:24,120 --> 02:06:29,120
you know?
And if we all come from a different 

2679
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:29,120
place,
you know,

2680
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:29,120
when I'll have a different,
um,

2681
02:06:30,030 --> 02:06:32,490
a different starting point,
that's what it is.

2682
02:06:32,610 --> 02:06:33,900
You know,
some people,

2683
02:06:34,140 --> 02:06:37,140
their parents are super cool and real 
open and their dads,

2684
02:06:37,141 --> 02:06:39,990
their best friend and you know,
and their dad was,

2685
02:06:40,020 --> 02:06:45,020
you know,
very educated and intelligent and raise 

2686
02:06:45,020 --> 02:06:45,020
them,
you know,

2687
02:06:45,020 --> 02:06:46,560
very,
very smart way.

2688
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:49,230
And that person has a huge headstart.
Huge,

2689
02:06:49,290 --> 02:06:50,940
huge,
huge headstart in life.

2690
02:06:50,940 --> 02:06:55,940
If your parents are cool.
My parents were divorced when I was a 

2691
02:06:55,940 --> 02:06:55,940
little kid.
My,

2692
02:06:55,940 --> 02:07:00,081
you know,
my Stepdad came into the picture when I 

2693
02:07:00,081 --> 02:07:00,081
was seven.
He was 24.

2694
02:07:00,081 --> 02:07:03,150
And imagine if you were 24 years old and
you know,

2695
02:07:03,180 --> 02:07:04,950
actually I was five when he came into 
picture.

2696
02:07:05,150 --> 02:07:09,360
You were 24 years old and you have a 
fucking five year old kid hanging around

2697
02:07:09,361 --> 02:07:10,680
with you,
you know.

2698
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:12,750
So if he came in the picture when I was 
five,

2699
02:07:12,770 --> 02:07:15,420
then he was like 22,
that's young as fuck,

2700
02:07:15,660 --> 02:07:20,660
you know,
to be that young and to be around 

2701
02:07:20,660 --> 02:07:21,060
someone else's kid,
someone else's loud ass kid,

2702
02:07:21,660 --> 02:07:23,190
you know,
that's hard to deal with.

2703
02:07:23,310 --> 02:07:26,580
So a lot of you out there and maybe you 
my 23 year old friend,

2704
02:07:26,730 --> 02:07:28,590
maybe you have a headstart,
you know,

2705
02:07:28,740 --> 02:07:31,740
maybe you'll be smarter than me when you
were 23 than when I was 23.

2706
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:34,410
But I think um,
what,

2707
02:07:34,530 --> 02:07:39,530
what I was talking about recently with a
friend of mine was that guys like 

2708
02:07:39,530 --> 02:07:39,530
Michael Jackson or you know,
or,

2709
02:07:39,530 --> 02:07:41,050
or anybody that I know that's 
exceptional.

2710
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:46,320
Almost everybody I know that's really 
exceptional at anything had kind of a 

2711
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:47,800
fucked up childhood.
I think that's really weird.

2712
02:07:48,220 --> 02:07:53,220
You know,
people that I know that are like all my 

2713
02:07:53,220 --> 02:07:54,970
friends that are really good comics,
all my friends that are like really good

2714
02:07:54,971 --> 02:07:59,971
artists.
All of them had fucked up childhoods we 

2715
02:07:59,971 --> 02:07:59,971
doing.
Showing the beginning thing again,

2716
02:08:00,850 --> 02:08:04,390
showing the beginning thing again.
That'd be getting things pretty bad ass.

2717
02:08:05,710 --> 02:08:07,120
I think um,
you know,

2718
02:08:07,480 --> 02:08:09,040
I think it's horrible.
You know,

2719
02:08:09,130 --> 02:08:12,520
that people have fucked up childhoods.
But I think there's something,

2720
02:08:13,030 --> 02:08:15,040
something that comes out of that.
Right.

2721
02:08:15,890 --> 02:08:17,350
You know,
like when you're in balanced,

2722
02:08:17,410 --> 02:08:21,340
it's like your,
your ride is so much rockier,

2723
02:08:21,341 --> 02:08:22,960
but there's so much more energy behind 
it.

2724
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:24,810
It's like if you can get ahold of it 
and,

2725
02:08:24,830 --> 02:08:29,830
and control your personality and,
and figuring out a way to stabilize it 

2726
02:08:29,830 --> 02:08:32,440
and it's like you have so much more 
thrust than a person who is content,

2727
02:08:33,910 --> 02:08:37,720
but it might be unhealthy.
Final words,

2728
02:08:37,930 --> 02:08:39,460
final words.
Listen,

2729
02:08:39,550 --> 02:08:44,550
pitches sign,
kind of final words will tell you a 

2730
02:08:44,550 --> 02:08:46,960
couple of these questions in the forums 
dot Joe Rogan.net

2731
02:08:46,990 --> 02:08:48,250
website.
Before we bail,

2732
02:08:51,030 --> 02:08:56,030
this is fucking question.
What is your take on the Global Freeman 

2733
02:08:56,030 --> 02:08:58,390
on the land movement?
What do you think?

2734
02:08:58,391 --> 02:09:03,391
Without law and order,
people generally maintain the peace or 

2735
02:09:03,391 --> 02:09:03,391
descend into anarchy.
That's hilarious.

2736
02:09:03,391 --> 02:09:05,200
Some people are just waiting for shit to
fall apart,

2737
02:09:05,201 --> 02:09:06,190
man.
You know?

2738
02:09:06,220 --> 02:09:08,140
How many people do we have on our 
message board?

2739
02:09:08,141 --> 02:09:11,140
This is a dude named 42 kang.
Just listen to the first question.

2740
02:09:11,260 --> 02:09:14,170
What is your take on the Global Freeman 
on the land movement?

2741
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:16,090
Fuck,
are you talking about man?

2742
02:09:17,080 --> 02:09:18,240
What does that mean?
What does.

2743
02:09:18,270 --> 02:09:19,120
What do you.
What are you saying?

2744
02:09:19,650 --> 02:09:22,810
What's your take?
This is my favorite thing.

2745
02:09:22,811 --> 02:09:23,500
When people go,
man,

2746
02:09:23,501 --> 02:09:26,540
you're gonna have to.
Gold is going to be come with valuable.

2747
02:09:26,541 --> 02:09:28,060
Our going gonna fall apart,
man.

2748
02:09:28,061 --> 02:09:30,910
It's going to be only thing that's going
to be worth something is gold.

2749
02:09:31,470 --> 02:09:34,450
Really?
Did you ever watch Mad Max?

2750
02:09:34,451 --> 02:09:35,380
You stupid.
Fuck.

2751
02:09:35,440 --> 02:09:36,820
When society falls apart,
you're gonna.

2752
02:09:36,821 --> 02:09:39,250
Need a car and guns and gasoline.
Okay.

2753
02:09:39,370 --> 02:09:44,370
You're not going to need gold.
Nobody gives a fuck about that stupid 

2754
02:09:44,370 --> 02:09:44,470
yellow metal.
You're going to need bullets.

2755
02:09:44,530 --> 02:09:47,260
Okay?
Yummy food and a place to sleep.

2756
02:09:47,261 --> 02:09:49,540
It's warm.
You know what I'm saying?

2757
02:09:49,820 --> 02:09:53,530
The fuck are you dealing with gold.
Gold isn't worth anything.

2758
02:09:53,740 --> 02:09:56,140
Pussy and guns.
That's.

2759
02:09:56,160 --> 02:09:57,970
That's all.
Those are valuable assets.

2760
02:09:58,900 --> 02:10:00,340
Cars.
That's important.

2761
02:10:00,430 --> 02:10:03,430
House as important.
Preferably surrounded by chain link,

2762
02:10:03,431 --> 02:10:05,560
fence and dogs.
Okay.

2763
02:10:05,680 --> 02:10:07,780
That's what you're going to need.
You're not going to go you dumb.

2764
02:10:07,810 --> 02:10:11,230
Fuck.
What do I think about James?

2765
02:10:11,231 --> 02:10:13,780
Tony fight in the UFC.
I'm a huge James Tony Fan.

2766
02:10:13,781 --> 02:10:15,970
He was an awesome boxer.
Still isn't awesome boxer,

2767
02:10:16,540 --> 02:10:19,390
but you know,
I don't know if he's really into it.

2768
02:10:19,420 --> 02:10:20,560
If he's really into it.
He said,

2769
02:10:20,561 --> 02:10:21,280
fucking,
you know,

2770
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:24,880
fucking champion a guy.
So good at boxing and wrestling.

2771
02:10:24,881 --> 02:10:25,780
If you're really.
Who knows?

2772
02:10:25,781 --> 02:10:28,060
Maybe he's been.
He's been watching this shit for years.

2773
02:10:28,090 --> 02:10:29,710
We don't know.
Everybody's talking shit.

2774
02:10:29,830 --> 02:10:31,810
He might've been secretly working on his
wrestling.

2775
02:10:32,050 --> 02:10:34,010
He might have a six bra.
If you've got to

2776
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:35,810
stand up with that dude and he's got 
four ounce gloves.

2777
02:10:35,930 --> 02:10:39,980
He's gonna fuck you up.
Oh Damn.

2778
02:10:40,190 --> 02:10:41,690
James.
Tony boxing with you.

2779
02:10:41,691 --> 02:10:46,691
That guy is going to fuck you up.
I don't know how he eats those leg 

2780
02:10:46,691 --> 02:10:46,691
kicks.
Leg Kicks.

2781
02:10:46,691 --> 02:10:50,960
Fuck them up.
Get a guy like ray cifo in there with 

2782
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:50,960
them.
Boom,

2783
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:50,960
boom,
boom.

2784
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:55,480
Those fucking thunderous tree trunk leg 
kicks down on your meat and making your 

2785
02:10:56,201 --> 02:11:01,201
legs buckle.
You only took a couple of those bitches 

2786
02:11:01,201 --> 02:11:01,201
and page through yet.
No.

2787
02:11:01,201 --> 02:11:01,720
Well,
I have everything set up.

2788
02:11:01,721 --> 02:11:06,721
So there's 100 images at or 100 posts.
Why my site excited about coming to 

2789
02:11:09,251 --> 02:11:10,420
Toronto?
Have I ever been?

2790
02:11:10,421 --> 02:11:15,421
No,
I've never been in Toronto and I can't 

2791
02:11:15,421 --> 02:11:15,421
fucking wait.
Your wife has nice tits.

2792
02:11:15,421 --> 02:11:18,010
Maltipoo very nice tits.
Aaron told me to say that.

2793
02:11:18,280 --> 02:11:20,950
He said Tell my wife she has nice tits.
She does.

2794
02:11:21,100 --> 02:11:21,910
She has nice tits.

2795
02:11:21,910 --> 02:11:24,190
Congratulations sir.
I'm reading the page,

2796
02:11:24,191 --> 02:11:26,410
man.
You're not seeing.

2797
02:11:26,460 --> 02:11:31,460
He said,
I'm just seeing if he's reading the 

2798
02:11:31,460 --> 02:11:31,460
page.
Really?

2799
02:11:31,460 --> 02:11:33,930
You had to say that because you didn't 
want to be bragging about your wife's 

2800
02:11:33,930 --> 02:11:36,070
tits.
You know what to say about being drugs,

2801
02:11:36,071 --> 02:11:38,860
but smoking weed and fucking is just 
awesome.

2802
02:11:39,100 --> 02:11:41,590
Being drunk is better when it comes to 
eating pussy though.

2803
02:11:41,710 --> 02:11:44,050
Really?
Being not in my opinion,

2804
02:11:44,230 --> 02:11:49,230
in my opinion,
being drunk is better when it comes to 

2805
02:11:49,230 --> 02:11:51,151
eating ass because it's the only time I 
do it because I never even asked when 

2806
02:11:51,151 --> 02:11:54,971
I'm sober.
The only time he had asked me sober is 

2807
02:11:54,971 --> 02:11:54,971
when you just get out of jail.
So when you're.

2808
02:11:54,971 --> 02:11:57,510
When you're high,
you don't want to eat ass either,

2809
02:11:57,550 --> 02:11:59,830
but I beat the fuck out of some pussy 
rental heart.

2810
02:12:00,690 --> 02:12:02,770
You just,
you like it depends.

2811
02:12:03,010 --> 02:12:05,920
It's Megan Fox asked.
I'll eat that anytime of day.

2812
02:12:06,700 --> 02:12:08,500
Anytime of the day he thought ass talk,
Yak.

2813
02:12:08,530 --> 02:12:10,840
What if it's all poor?
Don't care.

2814
02:12:11,320 --> 02:12:13,300
Either wipe it off and just dive in 
there.

2815
02:12:13,330 --> 02:12:16,150
I'll wipe it off with your mouth.
I'll start with the hair.

2816
02:12:16,330 --> 02:12:21,330
Well,
that's why I think it's important to 

2817
02:12:21,330 --> 02:12:22,531
drink drinking.
The reason why drinking and eating ass 

2818
02:12:22,531 --> 02:12:23,890
goes in hand in hand is the alcohol 
kills the Cola.

2819
02:12:24,370 --> 02:12:26,950
I mean when you're drinking jack and 
cokes and you're eating ass,

2820
02:12:27,120 --> 02:12:32,120
the alcohol is killing any bad bacteria.
That alcohol is flushed your whole 

2821
02:12:32,120 --> 02:12:34,660
system with poison.
Nothing's grown in that.

2822
02:12:34,770 --> 02:12:36,490
No,
no bacteria is going to take hold.

2823
02:12:36,670 --> 02:12:41,670
It's going to get swallowed up in that 
whole antiseptic chemical reaction that 

2824
02:12:42,641 --> 02:12:47,641
the Jack and coke has.
That's why you really think you can eat 

2825
02:12:47,641 --> 02:12:49,180
ass when you're a jack and coke when 
you're high.

2826
02:12:49,181 --> 02:12:54,181
You don't want to eat ass because when 
you're high like this is probably not 

2827
02:12:54,181 --> 02:12:54,181
the best.

2828
02:12:54,181 --> 02:12:57,410
I never even put like metal in there and
it cleans the metal.

2829
02:12:57,590 --> 02:13:00,730
Did you know that if you take jewelry 
and putting on a candidate coke,

2830
02:13:00,760 --> 02:13:03,460
it just dissolves all the face of 
coconut frog?

2831
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:06,220
Yeah.
If you take a put a frog in big thing of

2832
02:13:06,221 --> 02:13:07,570
coke,
like a dead frog.

2833
02:13:07,870 --> 02:13:10,260
It just eats all the skin away and just 
bone makes it go.

2834
02:13:10,300 --> 02:13:12,460
Is that true folks or is that one of 
those?

2835
02:13:12,960 --> 02:13:16,670
Those do exchangers we used because I 
heard that the,

2836
02:13:16,671 --> 02:13:18,460
the taking the paint off cars was 
bullshit.

2837
02:13:18,510 --> 02:13:21,260
It's like bullshit.
I don't think snopes anyone do.

2838
02:13:21,330 --> 02:13:22,180
If you,
you know,

2839
02:13:22,181 --> 02:13:24,400
one of the best things to clean your 
grill is coke.

2840
02:13:24,610 --> 02:13:25,550
Really?
Yeah.

2841
02:13:25,960 --> 02:13:27,910
Damn a rag.
But you know what?

2842
02:13:28,090 --> 02:13:31,350
The doctors,
when you haven't like a fucking barbecue

2843
02:13:31,351 --> 02:13:32,040
sandwich,

2844
02:13:32,290 --> 02:13:35,520
a nice goddamn cold cold.
It's pretty fucking delicious,

2845
02:13:36,120 --> 02:13:38,760
right?
So barbecue pork pulled pork sandwich.

2846
02:13:41,380 --> 02:13:43,140
Alright Ladies and gentlemen,
uh,

2847
02:13:43,141 --> 02:13:45,510
I think that's going to be the end.
We got to take one more question.

2848
02:13:45,511 --> 02:13:47,220
So we end on a high note.
But,

2849
02:13:47,221 --> 02:13:49,080
uh,
we are enjoying the fuck out of this.

2850
02:13:49,230 --> 02:13:54,230
Here's this.
To disclose your product has 400 

2851
02:13:54,230 --> 02:13:54,360
witnesses proving ete life exists.
Even astronauts.

2852
02:13:54,780 --> 02:13:59,780
Listen,
just because you have 400 people saying 

2853
02:13:59,780 --> 02:13:59,840
that they've seen Ufo,
that does not mean there's cfos.

2854
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:05,000
That means you have 400 people that say 
they've seen you have false and they 

2855
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:05,310
might really believe they cfos,
but you know,

2856
02:14:05,311 --> 02:14:08,040
they have a real problem that hunters 
have a real problem.

2857
02:14:08,310 --> 02:14:13,310
And this exhibit,
this happens all over the world where 

2858
02:14:13,310 --> 02:14:16,580
I'm the most experienced hunters are the
ones that wind up accidentally killing 

2859
02:14:16,711 --> 02:14:21,711
people.
And the reason being is that these guys 

2860
02:14:21,711 --> 02:14:21,780
are winning your experience.

2861
02:14:21,780 --> 02:14:26,780
Hunter,
you know that sometimes your window of 

2862
02:14:26,780 --> 02:14:27,210
opportunity where you get a shot at a 
deer is real short.

2863
02:14:27,350 --> 02:14:29,460
You've got to be able to react.
But the deer's right there,

2864
02:14:30,250 --> 02:14:35,250
you got to be able to shoot and people 
see things that aren't there and one of 

2865
02:14:35,250 --> 02:14:38,430
the things they all say a universally 
when they have an accident,

2866
02:14:38,580 --> 02:14:40,890
and these are like good people,
church going people,

2867
02:14:40,891 --> 02:14:42,840
no anger,
no violence issues.

2868
02:14:42,900 --> 02:14:44,880
Guys are just loving on thing.
They say,

2869
02:14:44,910 --> 02:14:48,720
they swear they saw a deer.
They swear they saw deer.

2870
02:14:48,870 --> 02:14:50,940
One guy accidentally shot this,
um,

2871
02:14:51,660 --> 02:14:52,780
this woman,
uh,

2872
02:14:52,781 --> 02:14:56,910
in Maine and she had white mittens on 
and he is following a deer.

2873
02:14:56,970 --> 02:15:00,330
And this lady was in the woods and she 
had her white mittens on and he saw that

2874
02:15:00,331 --> 02:15:02,530
white.
And he said he saw the book.

2875
02:15:02,640 --> 02:15:07,640
He said he saw it.
He said it was right there in front of 

2876
02:15:07,640 --> 02:15:07,640
him.

2877
02:15:07,640 --> 02:15:10,700
And he said he squeezed off the trigger.
We don't fully understand how the,

2878
02:15:11,460 --> 02:15:15,210
our consciousness and our imagination 
affects what we see.

2879
02:15:15,740 --> 02:15:18,600
It's,
it's still very much.

2880
02:15:19,340 --> 02:15:21,360
It's,
there's something tricky to it.

2881
02:15:21,540 --> 02:15:24,420
Hallucinations and the ability to see 
things that aren't there,

2882
02:15:24,900 --> 02:15:29,900
that's real.
And if someone's in a very heightened 

2883
02:15:29,900 --> 02:15:29,900
state,
if they're in a very heightened state,

2884
02:15:29,900 --> 02:15:31,740
like if they're in the heightened state 
of,

2885
02:15:31,950 --> 02:15:32,610
you know,
of,

2886
02:15:32,611 --> 02:15:34,440
um,
wanting to see a deer,

2887
02:15:34,590 --> 02:15:37,650
or if they're in a heightened state of 
being in the woods in the dark,

2888
02:15:37,651 --> 02:15:41,130
and you think you see a monster,
you can see a fucking monster.

2889
02:15:41,250 --> 02:15:46,250
You can really see it.
You can convince yourself that you've 

2890
02:15:46,250 --> 02:15:49,191
actually seen it.
If you see something and you don't know 

2891
02:15:49,191 --> 02:15:52,131
what it is,
you will turn it into your mind and 

2892
02:15:52,131 --> 02:15:54,531
making a monster.
If you're out in the woods and it's 

2893
02:15:54,531 --> 02:15:56,301
Pitch Black and you stumble into a wild 
boar and you barely see it and it makes 

2894
02:15:56,701 --> 02:15:58,320
noise and runs away,
you could,

2895
02:15:58,400 --> 02:16:01,000
it could be some to,
you know,

2896
02:16:01,350 --> 02:16:06,350
to fucking foot tall troll man with you 
know,

2897
02:16:07,020 --> 02:16:09,750
giant fucking furry feet and glowing 
eyes.

2898
02:16:09,750 --> 02:16:13,950
You could make something up in your head
and you don't think you're doing it,

2899
02:16:14,130 --> 02:16:19,130
but you're doing it.
The human imagination and human memory 

2900
02:16:19,140 --> 02:16:24,140
or not totally to be trusted.
So unless they have actual evidence 

2901
02:16:24,140 --> 02:16:26,580
listening to anybody talk about Ufo as 
you have to listen to them and go,

2902
02:16:27,160 --> 02:16:28,260
hmm,
maybe,

2903
02:16:28,350 --> 02:16:31,590
maybe I'm not saying that you can't get,
you know,

2904
02:16:31,990 --> 02:16:33,280
hear from other planets.
I mean,

2905
02:16:33,281 --> 02:16:38,281
if you were so sophisticated that you 
can travel to this world from another 

2906
02:16:38,281 --> 02:16:42,961
galaxy or another solar system,
why wouldn't you be so sophisticated 

2907
02:16:43,061 --> 02:16:48,061
that you could hide?
Why wouldn't you be so sophisticated 

2908
02:16:48,061 --> 02:16:48,220
that you're,
you're Ufo is completely invisible.

2909
02:16:48,370 --> 02:16:50,230
Why wouldn't you be totally 
undetectable?

2910
02:16:50,410 --> 02:16:51,160
Why wouldn't you?
I mean,

2911
02:16:51,161 --> 02:16:55,570
maybe they would just have everything 
completely master the idea that,

2912
02:16:55,850 --> 02:16:57,850
you know,
they would show themselves and look like

2913
02:16:57,851 --> 02:17:02,851
they're dangling on a string.
Allow people to take pictures and you 

2914
02:17:02,851 --> 02:17:02,851
know,
and they all,

2915
02:17:02,851 --> 02:17:04,600
maybe they wanted us to see them really.

2916
02:17:04,600 --> 02:17:09,600
And that's how they did it.
They just showed up and some weird 

2917
02:17:09,600 --> 02:17:09,600
obscure place where you,
no,

2918
02:17:09,600 --> 02:17:10,300
no,
no,

2919
02:17:10,360 --> 02:17:11,410
no,
come on man.

2920
02:17:11,560 --> 02:17:12,820
No,
that's not what they're doing.

2921
02:17:12,980 --> 02:17:15,610
That if,
if there really are aliens,

2922
02:17:15,611 --> 02:17:19,120
they're probably so alien.
You can't even recognize them.

2923
02:17:19,330 --> 02:17:24,330
They're probably.
I think that what we recognize is what 

2924
02:17:24,330 --> 02:17:24,820
we see in our dimension.
What we see in our environment,

2925
02:17:24,821 --> 02:17:29,821
what we see in our world,
I think there's probably life forms out 

2926
02:17:29,821 --> 02:17:31,990
there exist that are so alien to us.
We don't even have the sensors to detect

2927
02:17:31,991 --> 02:17:33,120
them.
You know,

2928
02:17:33,130 --> 02:17:37,120
and the way I've talked about this 
before and I was talking about farts and

2929
02:17:37,270 --> 02:17:40,360
that by when someone farts,
if you don't have a nose,

2930
02:17:40,390 --> 02:17:42,400
you have no idea.
It stinks you.

2931
02:17:42,430 --> 02:17:47,430
There's literally something going around
you that's invisible and the sense that 

2932
02:17:47,430 --> 02:17:51,001
you have tunes into it.
How do we not know that there are an 

2933
02:17:51,001 --> 02:17:53,260
infinite amount of things that we cannot
detect that are around us all the time.

2934
02:17:53,410 --> 02:17:58,410
We don't.
It's just guesswork because something's 

2935
02:17:58,410 --> 02:17:59,140
not on the same frequency as us.
Something's not solid.

2936
02:17:59,141 --> 02:18:04,141
It's not tangible.
You can't bang on it because just 

2937
02:18:04,141 --> 02:18:07,150
because of that doesn't mean it's not 
real and if there are aliens,

2938
02:18:07,151 --> 02:18:11,110
they're probably so fucking alien.
You can't even see it there.

2939
02:18:11,140 --> 02:18:13,540
They're probably on a totally different 
frequency than we are.

2940
02:18:14,050 --> 02:18:19,050
I'm not buying all these dudes that say 
they've seen Ufo is because they really 

2941
02:18:19,050 --> 02:18:19,610
want to see you,
fos.

2942
02:18:19,780 --> 02:18:24,780
These motherfuckers want to see it.
They have all had experiences and 

2943
02:18:24,780 --> 02:18:28,681
something's happened to them,
but they want to see you for they want 

2944
02:18:28,681 --> 02:18:30,610
so bad they've given up on their jobs.
They've given up on their careers,

2945
02:18:30,700 --> 02:18:33,430
they've decided to pursue [inaudible] 
full time.

2946
02:18:33,580 --> 02:18:36,850
They make youtube videos constantly.
They do conferences and seminars.

2947
02:18:37,030 --> 02:18:42,030
They have a lot of vested interests 
involved in the idea of flying saucers 

2948
02:18:42,030 --> 02:18:43,390
and ships from other planets coming to 
this earth,

2949
02:18:43,660 --> 02:18:48,660
and there's a lot of psychological 
things you have to take into 

2950
02:18:48,660 --> 02:18:50,791
consideration like why these people want
to see these things and when these 

2951
02:18:50,791 --> 02:18:51,670
experiences happen,
that's another thing.

2952
02:18:51,670 --> 02:18:55,540
People individually experiences,
especially alien abduction experiences.

2953
02:18:55,780 --> 02:19:00,780
Most of those things come in the middle 
of the night while people are dreaming 

2954
02:19:00,780 --> 02:19:01,450
and when you're dreaming in the middle 
of the night,

2955
02:19:01,451 --> 02:19:05,620
your brain is producing all sorts of 
psychedelic chemicals including dmt.

2956
02:19:05,740 --> 02:19:10,740
The most potent psychedelic known to man
is produced when you're in heavy rem 

2957
02:19:10,740 --> 02:19:14,011
sleep.
So when these people are having these 

2958
02:19:14,011 --> 02:19:16,051
alien abduction experiences,
how do you not know that it's not your 

2959
02:19:16,051 --> 02:19:19,291
imagination mixed in with psychedelic 
drugs that you don't even know you're 

2960
02:19:19,291 --> 02:19:20,500
having?
You're having these things in your brain

2961
02:19:20,501 --> 02:19:21,210
is producing,
um,

2962
02:19:21,211 --> 02:19:26,211
and you're having these incredible 
fucking psychedelic trips and maybe 

2963
02:19:26,211 --> 02:19:29,311
you're halfway into a dream and you wake
up and you're tripping out of these 

2964
02:19:29,311 --> 02:19:33,191
chemicals in your fucking brain and you 
start creating all these scenarios with 

2965
02:19:33,191 --> 02:19:33,470
your imagination.
Next thing you know,

2966
02:19:33,471 --> 02:19:34,610
you're on a spaceship.
Why?

2967
02:19:34,611 --> 02:19:37,310
Because you're in the middle of a 
fucking natural dmt trip.

2968
02:19:37,610 --> 02:19:40,160
And if you smoked DMT,
dumb people that want money.

2969
02:19:40,161 --> 02:19:40,940
Joe.
Actually,

2970
02:19:41,030 --> 02:19:42,590
there's this,
some people that are done though.

2971
02:19:42,650 --> 02:19:44,600
There's some people that aren't done 
that have real experiences.

2972
02:19:44,930 --> 02:19:45,610
You know,
I've,

2973
02:19:45,620 --> 02:19:47,110
I've,
I've seen their interviews,

2974
02:19:47,111 --> 02:19:49,700
I've read stuff they have,
I've read all the John Mac books.

2975
02:19:49,730 --> 02:19:51,860
So you,
some of them,

2976
02:19:51,861 --> 02:19:53,270
yes,
but there's a very,

2977
02:19:53,271 --> 02:19:55,520
it's,
there's no one you can't generalize,

2978
02:19:55,700 --> 02:19:58,190
but people have had ufo experiences,
but the,

2979
02:19:58,250 --> 02:20:00,680
any,
any supernatural,

2980
02:20:00,681 --> 02:20:02,020
phenomenal,
you know,

2981
02:20:02,060 --> 02:20:07,060
out of the ordinary experience has to be
considered in all sorts of different 

2982
02:20:07,060 --> 02:20:07,670
ways.
Where's the evidence and what else could

2983
02:20:07,671 --> 02:20:12,671
it have been?
And when you look at what time these 

2984
02:20:12,671 --> 02:20:15,431
things are taking place,
almost universally they take place late 

2985
02:20:15,431 --> 02:20:18,310
at night when people,
especially the alien abduction 

2986
02:20:18,310 --> 02:20:18,310
experiences almost universally take 
place late at night.

2987
02:20:18,310 --> 02:20:19,610
And when these people have these 
experiences,

2988
02:20:19,611 --> 02:20:21,860
they're all sleeping,
you know,

2989
02:20:22,420 --> 02:20:24,800
they're all like half out of it and 
something happens to them.

2990
02:20:25,010 --> 02:20:28,460
It's much more likely an endogenous dub 
of psychedelic chemicals.

2991
02:20:29,410 --> 02:20:31,430
Ladies and gentleman,
I'm no expert in my disclaimer.

2992
02:20:31,431 --> 02:20:32,660
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking 
about.

2993
02:20:32,690 --> 02:20:37,690
This is all shit that I've read on the 
Internet and watch documentaries on and 

2994
02:20:37,690 --> 02:20:40,980
um,
learned when I was in my isolation tech 

2995
02:20:40,980 --> 02:20:41,290
stone.
Um,

2996
02:20:41,350 --> 02:20:44,300
we've had a good time here today for 
either you have a good time.

2997
02:20:45,080 --> 02:20:47,060
Fifty percent of the time,
50 percent of the time.

2998
02:20:47,240 --> 02:20:52,240
What didn't you like about today?
I've heard a lot before when these 

2999
02:20:53,811 --> 02:20:55,580
subjects come up,
a lot of times I've said,

3000
02:20:55,581 --> 02:20:57,140
I've talked about all the shit many 
times before,

3001
02:20:57,141 --> 02:21:02,141
but Brian has to realize there's a lot 
of people out there that have not seen 

3002
02:21:02,141 --> 02:21:04,541
me talk about all these things before.
And when a interesting subjects like 

3003
02:21:04,541 --> 02:21:04,880
this come up,
you know,

3004
02:21:04,881 --> 02:21:09,881
you gotta you gotta address it.
I think it's an important thing to talk 

3005
02:21:09,881 --> 02:21:09,881
about.

3006
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:13,010
But we had a good fucking time.
Thank you very much.

3007
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:14,540
We're going to do this every week.
Like I said,

3008
02:21:14,541 --> 02:21:17,510
I upgraded my internet today.
Finally it's up.

3009
02:21:17,511 --> 02:21:22,511
So now I can get a Brian here beside us 
and we can load videos up and shit.

3010
02:21:23,031 --> 02:21:24,680
And like I said,
behind us,

3011
02:21:24,681 --> 02:21:29,681
we're going to put up a green screen and
when we put up the green screen we're 

3012
02:21:29,681 --> 02:21:29,681
going to be able to,
uh,

3013
02:21:29,681 --> 02:21:34,650
have like a space background and shit.
And I got all kinds of cool things 

3014
02:21:34,650 --> 02:21:34,650
coming on.
And we're going to do this every week.

3015
02:21:34,650 --> 02:21:35,360
Fuck it.
It's fun.

3016
02:21:35,361 --> 02:21:40,361
I enjoy it.
Next week I'm going to try to bring on 

3017
02:21:40,361 --> 02:21:41,120
my boy Joey Diaz.
Maybe Eddie Bravo would join us as well.

3018
02:21:41,210 --> 02:21:42,560
Maybe I should.
Fear will join us.

3019
02:21:42,561 --> 02:21:47,561
We might not have a whole Party in here 
because next week I'm going to have a 

3020
02:21:47,561 --> 02:21:47,561
big couch in here.
Um,

3021
02:21:47,561 --> 02:21:47,561
so,
uh,

3022
02:21:47,600 --> 02:21:49,250
thank you very much.
I had a good time.

3023
02:21:49,251 --> 02:21:50,700
You motherfuckers,
um,

3024
02:21:50,750 --> 02:21:51,740
if you,
uh,

3025
02:21:51,950 --> 02:21:54,320
want to come see me do stand up if 
you're in Miami.

3026
02:21:54,321 --> 02:21:59,321
I'm at the Lincoln Theater in Miami on 
the 22nd,

3027
02:21:59,720 --> 02:22:04,720
which is,
I think it's next Saturday or next 

3028
02:22:04,720 --> 02:22:04,720
Friday.
Next Friday.

3029
02:22:04,720 --> 02:22:04,720
Next Friday.
Next Friday.

3030
02:22:04,940 --> 02:22:07,130
The,
so a nine days for today.

3031
02:22:07,640 --> 02:22:12,640
So thank you very much.
Everybody wants to play that thing on 

3032
02:22:12,640 --> 02:22:12,640
fullscreen and that's how we'll end.
Thank you very much.

3033
02:22:12,640 --> 02:22:13,100
Love you bitches.

3034
02:22:15,270 --> 02:22:15,840
See you next week.
