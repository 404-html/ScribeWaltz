1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:05,160
The general experience and David Allan
Coe,

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,350
did you know we did our song,
our set and then he played and he was

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,400
onstage and he performed a song my mom
wrote called storms never last,

4
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:19,780
so my mom's over on the side of the
stage and we were talking to.

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,710
My mom were watching it and he's singing
it with his wife and stuff.

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,580
The next night I'm opening up for him
and he goes on stage and he goes,

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,660
last night,
Jessi colter was right in the front row

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:35,520
when I sang the song and my wife and she
was crying and like I'm sitting there

9
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:38,040
going,
I was here and she was not crying.

10
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,590
She was standing on the front row.
Right,

11
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,260
right.
My mom just kilder road.

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:42,990
This song,
storms,

13
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,740
everlast teasing and,
and that's his character.

14
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:51,140
That's who he is.
All I'm saying here with like I'm as

15
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,500
forgiving about him lying to the
audience because that is what he's doing

16
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:56,220
at the moment.

17
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,260
It's his.
I could sit there and go,

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,580
you know what?
You're lying.

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,170
I'm going to take you in the back.
We're going to talk.

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,730
I'm going to tell this audience tomorrow
night.

21
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:04,290
He's a liar.
He's a piece of shit.

22
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:06,660
Fuck him.
I'm not going to do that because it's

23
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:08,640
David Alcoa is,
but you just did it on the show,

24
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:13,641
which is a much larger audience and
millions of pieces of shit.

25
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,680
I'm just saying character.
Well,

26
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:19,740
why would I do that to him?
Because it's like,

27
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:21,480
you know,
I just feel like,

28
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:24,060
look man,
the Times that I met Alex at times I've

29
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:25,470
been around him.
Yeah man,

30
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:29,700
his Gig is this and he got called out
for a specific thing.

31
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,060
Yes.
It involved the lives of children and

32
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:33,690
everything that I understand that I'm
not.

33
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,670
I'm not at all sympathizing for the
family or for him versus those families,

34
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,660
but I'm just saying,
I just think that like at the moment

35
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:47,070
everything is so hot with this and it's,
it's kind of exhausting and it's the

36
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:50,280
Internet is the reason for it and in my
opinion,

37
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:52,530
because I think that like all of the
years that have come along,

38
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,440
the mass amount of people that have
migrated to social media,

39
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,160
the way that the integrated
conversations happened,

40
00:01:58,161 --> 00:02:00,660
the way that that stuff ends up on the
news now,

41
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,960
like aol chat rooms in fucking 1998.

42
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,160
That shit did not end up on CNN.
People were not listening to those.

43
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:08,551
The,
the,

44
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:10,740
the,
the best to get the closest you could

45
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:13,240
get to fucking tv was to catch a
Predator when,

46
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,150
when you were on that,
at that time,

47
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:17,340
you know,
and I feel like at this point in time

48
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,670
people need again,
not those families,

49
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,140
their lawsuit.
That's fine,

50
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,390
that's,
that's their thing.

51
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,700
But,
but I just feel like people need to

52
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:31,701
lighten up a little bit in the sense of.
I just think that the social media thing

53
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:36,711
is very hazardous and I think that
people's faith in all of it,

54
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:40,170
it doesn't have to do with,
with fake news and it doesn't have to do

55
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:44,340
with Russian bots and all this shit.
I just think that like Alex Jones is a

56
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:49,341
casualty because he's always been that.
What do you mean by another really odd

57
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,150
comic Davidson?
Sarah's story is he always told me when

58
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:56,610
you're on the road,
don't read from your current book.

59
00:02:56,611 --> 00:03:00,130
Always read from the next four pieces to
way of road testing the stories

60
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,790
and finding out which ones work and
should go into the next book.

61
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,660
And in doing so,
he was telling this story about being in

62
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:08,494
this,
uh,

63
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,010
this forensic,
uh,

64
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,450
a laboratory isn't an,
as an autopsy was taking place.

65
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,500
And this autopsy table was adjacent to
this huge indoor window that separated

66
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:25,531
the autopsy suite from this lunch room
and in the lunch room where the rest of

67
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:26,300
the,
uh,

68
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,540
the forensic staff,
they're all eating their lunches.

69
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,520
They all had tuna sandwiches and cans of
coke and barbecued potato chips.

70
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:40,000
And they were watching through the
window as this absolutely perfect.

71
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,630
Twelve year old boy was being autopsied
and just hours before at this kid,

72
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:49,030
like two hours before this kid had been
riding his bicycle,

73
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,390
he'd fallen over.
He'd hit his head on the curb.

74
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:58,140
And now two hours later he was dead and
dead without almost a scratch on him.

75
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,930
Just this perfect naked dead 12 year old
boy on the autopsy table.

76
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,560
And as he that the technicians eating
their lunch,

77
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,210
watching it through a window that they
watch as the,

78
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:18,211
uh,
as the pathologist in sizes around the

79
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:20,950
top of the kid's face at the top of the
forehead,

80
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:24,340
the hairline,
and then peels the face down,

81
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,490
like peeling an orange peels the entire
face off of the skull of this little boy

82
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,970
and leaves the face around the neck like
a mask,

83
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:38,650
like a rubber mask.
And this exposes this liver colored dark

84
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:42,430
red musculature of the child's
underlying face.

85
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,410
And this one guy watching it with a
mouthful of tuna sandwich,

86
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,020
he points this out and he says,
see that?

87
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,410
That there,
that's the color of red that I want to

88
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:56,590
paint our rec room.
Holy Shit,

89
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:01,690
and once the data has told that story in
front of 600 people,

90
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,720
it was dead silent and you could hear
people weeping.

91
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:14,430
People were crying and they were hating
David's sit doris in that moment and so

92
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,900
I had to laugh.
I laughed really loud,

93
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:21,901
like a donkey and it was amazing how the
hatred in that auditorium swung from

94
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:27,070
hating David,
who they did not want to hate to hating

95
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:32,071
this jackass over here who was actually
laughing and so I threw myself on the

96
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:37,570
sword for David and that story never
went in any book and like I said,

97
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,820
you can do that.
And philosophers like arguing and

98
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:41,980
debating the meaning of things.
For me,

99
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:43,540
it's harder.
People are using the word.

100
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,200
That's the meaning.
I concede that.

101
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:52,360
Well,
we can see why I don't call myself an

102
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:55,450
atheist.
It's why you can look up the dictionary

103
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:58,040
definition of atheist and a kind of
applies

104
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,090
to me,
but what is the definition of atheist in

105
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:05,360
practice?
It is what leading atheists do and it's

106
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:07,760
their conduct and it's their behaviors,
what they say,

107
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,900
and it's,
it's,

108
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,370
it's their attitudes that is what an
atheist is today because they're the

109
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:18,371
most visible exemplars of that word and
most of their conduct either don't agree

110
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:23,660
with or simply don't engage in what
don't you agree with?

111
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,780
I don't debate religious people and tell
them they're idiots.

112
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,970
I don't know.
That doesn't work.

113
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,670
It's missing whether or not it works and
it's just not.

114
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,720
It's not in me to do that.
I don't purge myself of words that have

115
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:41,240
religious foundations in them.
I once in my facebook,

116
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:44,480
I had a friend going up in orbit to
repair the Hubble Telescope,

117
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:47,570
one of the astronauts and I said,
uh,

118
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,630
Godspeed.
And then I gave the astronauts name

119
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,060
people wrote in,
in the threads that I thought you were

120
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:53,540
an atheist.

121
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,960
How could you say Godspeed and atheist
got angry with me and I said,

122
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,730
okay.
First of all,

123
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,110
this phrase is deeply historical in the
space program.

124
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,480
When John Glenn was launched,
the headline was Godspeed John Glenn.

125
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,300
Every mission where we send human beings
into space.

126
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,860
Somewhere there is that reference in the
NASA fancy word means I'll tell you,

127
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,070
I'll tell you what it means.
Please do

128
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,221
so.
Oh,

129
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:22,030
by the way,
I'll get to that in just one minute.

130
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,380
The atheist who are arguing that I was
using Godspeed as a phrase,

131
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,240
they all have used the phrase goodbye
having to see you later.

132
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:34,190
Goodbye.
What does that word come from?

133
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,230
It's from God.
Be With you.

134
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,490
It's a contraction of those three words.
Oh,

135
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,130
and why would you say this?
You would say this to someone leaving

136
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:46,910
the city wall where it's dangerous.
Okay.

137
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,950
Back when you had city states,
you're going to,

138
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:50,780
you,
you're a good God.

139
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,780
Be With you to bring protection for you.
Between one city.

140
00:07:56,211 --> 00:07:59,890
One of the people who's asking,
asked me to have pictures of my other

141
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:02,740
dogs.
They're actually both passed away now.

142
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,030
I had to put them both down.
Both your bull mastiffs stiff in the

143
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:09,660
English of the English bulldog.
She mixed.

144
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:10,960
They were,
uh,

145
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:16,850
they were both 13 years old and I'm.
Johnny couldn't walk anymore.

146
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,590
It was,
it was really rough

147
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,060
the last few days of his life.
Um,

148
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:25,983
I would,
uh,

149
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,220
try to bring them in for dinner and when
I would try to bring them in,

150
00:08:30,221 --> 00:08:34,870
he literally couldn't make,
it was a small yard where he was at,

151
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,610
but we're talking about like,
you know,

152
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,110
15 yards.
He couldn't make it 15 yards to the

153
00:08:41,111 --> 00:08:44,320
house.
He will take a couple steps and his body

154
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:48,820
would shake and he'd take a couple of
steps and he was just sleeping all day

155
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:53,110
and he was also having a really hard
time shifting and he would occasionally

156
00:08:53,111 --> 00:08:55,890
shit in the house,
like he couldn't hold his bowels and he

157
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:57,970
couldn't go outside when he wanted to
look at,

158
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,920
you'd see them trying.

159
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,920
But his,
his body was so old from massive 13

160
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,520
years old,
his crazy old,

161
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,760
like a lot of them die at like eight or
nine and he was 13 and he was sweet,

162
00:09:11,491 --> 00:09:14,610
sweet dog up until the end.
But he just,

163
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,170
he was,
you know,

164
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,450
he was suffering.
It was,

165
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,110
it was hard.
It's hard when you know them when

166
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:27,111
they're a puppy and then 10 years later,
like you're kind of the same and they're

167
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:28,950
not men,
they're gone.

168
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,620
You know.
So I think about that with Marshall

169
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:35,070
because he's only a year and a half and
he's so full of life and he's so fun.

170
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,120
He's so silly and playful and happy.
I'm like,

171
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,650
man,
there's going to be a day where

172
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,570
Marshall's,
this old old,

173
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:45,540
old dog and I'm going to have to put him
down to,

174
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,750
you know,
it was depressing and the other one,

175
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:51,090
brutus,
the Shiba Inu English bulldog mix.

176
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,880
He was better than Johnny for a long
time.

177
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,260
Still I've known for the last two years
that they didn't have much time left.

178
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:58,800
You know,
they were,

179
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,800
they were both struggling hard.
But Brutus took a real hard turn over

180
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:08,760
the last few months where he wouldn't
even come in.

181
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,860
Like I tried to get them to come in my
body,

182
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,990
you want to eat.
I try to put a little food in front of

183
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:16,340
his face and he would try to stand up
and his legs would be shaken.

184
00:10:16,341 --> 00:10:20,320
And it's just so hard,
man.

185
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,190
It's so hard watching them fade away,
you know?

186
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:25,980
And then also watching them suffer,
you know,

187
00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:29,610
a lot the last,
the last days where you have to decide

188
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:30,444
where,
you know,

189
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,490
me and my wife had to have conversations
like,

190
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,520
look,
we have to do something like this,

191
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,870
like one day we're going to come home,
it's going to be a dead dog.

192
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,660
And it's not like they're having a good
time.

193
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:44,100
Like this is a,
this is a horrible suffering slow

194
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:47,580
demise.
So did you have someone come to the

195
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:48,510
house?
When did you take them?

196
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,430
Yeah,
it was rough,

197
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:51,840
dude.
That's rough.

198
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,320
Just ask yourself what problems do I
have right now?

199
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,150
But genuinely like problems.
And the answer may not always be zero,

200
00:11:01,151 --> 00:11:06,151
but it's usually surprisingly small when
you think about the immediate,

201
00:11:06,551 --> 00:11:11,290
you know,
not just the base level of Maslow's

202
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,780
hierarchy,
right?

203
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,580
Like if that's taken care of,
usually it's like,

204
00:11:15,581 --> 00:11:18,520
oh I don't know.
There are things that are ongoing things

205
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:20,720
to figure out,
but like things that you could define as

206
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:26,060
a problem and then just kind of staying
in that space of like,

207
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,270
you know,
like a control issue.

208
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,690
Like what's a real issue where there's
like immediacy,

209
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,060
like you know,
and,

210
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:36,760
and when,
when there are real problems,

211
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,010
you know,
a lot of times you,

212
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,180
you handle it well,
like instinctually the things like a lot

213
00:11:43,181 --> 00:11:48,181
of times people get caught in those
intense situations like,

214
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:50,980
you know,
like they can handle like real problems.

215
00:11:50,981 --> 00:11:55,690
It's the anticipation of problems and
the anticipation of solutions that bass.

216
00:11:55,691 --> 00:11:56,710
What drives you.
Crazy.

217
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,850
Very good point.
Yeah.

218
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,230
That's a very good point.
Yeah.

219
00:11:59,231 --> 00:12:02,950
A lot of times real problems.
They also sort of enlightened you to the

220
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:05,770
fact that most of the time your problems
are bullshit.

221
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,270
You know,
you break your leg,

222
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,153
you're,
oh,

223
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,470
that's an immediate.
Yeah,

224
00:12:10,471 --> 00:12:11,590
yeah,
yeah,

225
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,970
yeah,
yeah.

226
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,950
And so just staying in the space of
like,

227
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,450
you know,
all right,

228
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,370
I can,
you're in a control center.

229
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,450
You Go,
you know.
