1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,250
And we're live Mr Sharma.
Welcome.

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:08,330
Thanks.
Thanks for having me.

3
00:00:08,331 --> 00:00:09,260
Thanks for being here,
man.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,113
Appreciate it.
I have been paying attention to your 

5
00:00:11,631 --> 00:00:13,570
work for a long time.
It's a no,

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,870
you're the one who bakes.
Yes.

7
00:00:14,871 --> 00:00:19,460
I'm one of those guys.
I'm sure you've got a lot but a bunch of

8
00:00:19,461 --> 00:00:21,060
your books here.
Thanks for bringing those in.

9
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:23,720
I really appreciate that.
You have some stuff to read.

10
00:00:23,721 --> 00:00:26,720
Now,
how did you get involved in skepticism?

11
00:00:26,721 --> 00:00:28,670
I know you started off as a cyclist,
right?

12
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:29,601
Uh,
yeah.

13
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:30,540
Well I was a,

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,673
a bike racer from 1980 to about 1990,
about 10 years in between when I was 

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:37,973
first in college.
I went to pepperdine and then cal state 

16
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:40,880
fullerton.
And then uh,

17
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,490
I just was burned out.
I had a master's degree and uh,

18
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,670
I just decided I didn't want to do 
another six straight years of phd work.

19
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:48,504
So I quit and I went over the,
a placement office at cal state 

20
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:52,080
fullerton and said,
well,

21
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:53,010
I need a job.
They said,

22
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:53,491
well,
can you do?

23
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:54,324
I said nothing.
And I'm,

24
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,343
I have no skills.
I'm a college student but I like to 

25
00:00:56,731 --> 00:00:58,620
write,
so I got a job at a bike magazine,

26
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,180
my first job out of college and it was a
trade magazine for um,

27
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,620
for uh,
the bike industry,

28
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,753
uh,
but I got right into cycling right away 

29
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:10,500
about a bike the first week and when you
weren't a bike rider before this job.

30
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:12,923
And I went to um,
a big event at the Griffith Park where 

31
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:18,630
they had a yoplait yogurt 50 kilometer 
bike race.

32
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:23,070
And Jonathan Boyer was the Big Star.
He had the first American to do the Tour

33
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:23,940
de France.
And I saw him.

34
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:24,481
It's like,
wow,

35
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:26,950
this is a cool sport.
So I just got into it.

36
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:30,330
I just started riding and racing and 
then I did.

37
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,050
We started race across America in 1992 
in 1982.

38
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,520
And so I quit my job and just did that 
for,

39
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,403
for a decade.
I had corporate sponsors and we had ABC 

40
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:42,200
wide world of sports that contract with 
them to film it.

41
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,960
And we turned it into a little little 
mini culture business.

42
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,823
And you know,
ultra and ultra endurance sports were 

43
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:52,530
just taking off the iron man.
It became famous in the early eighties,

44
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:53,550
John Howard,
who won,

45
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,393
it was one of the first to do the race 
across America with me and two other 

46
00:01:56,821 --> 00:02:01,740
guys and I did a rod dog sled race.
And then soon after that,

47
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:03,380
we're all those,
um,

48
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,440
a sort of long distance mixed sport type
things where you run and hike and swim.

49
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:09,930
And,
and,

50
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:10,441
uh,
anyway,

51
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:13,070
so that was just part of that culture 
and you know,

52
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,040
I was young and single and didn't have a
house or mortgage,

53
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:16,681
you know,
that stuff.

54
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:18,360
So you can do,
do those kinds of things.

55
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,420
That's a fascinating thing to get into 
too,

56
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:23,420
because I mean that,
that's a real rabbit hole.

57
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,770
You get into two when you started into 
cycling and endurance racing and you,

58
00:02:27,771 --> 00:02:28,604
you,
you understand the culture and you get 

59
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:32,840
into those people there.
There are bizarre group of people.

60
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,740
They are,
yes,

61
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,480
actually,
uh,

62
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,150
the subculture of ultra endurance 
athletes as a number of Weirdos.

63
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,700
But so does the sort of skeptical 
movement.

64
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,543
I've decided that all kind of social 
subcultures have a handful of real 

65
00:02:45,981 --> 00:02:46,814
weirdos.
The people that show up at your door 

66
00:02:47,871 --> 00:02:49,160
like,
can I stay here this weekend?

67
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,053
What?
No,

68
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,510
you have skeptics that.
Because there are also skeptical there.

69
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,300
There.
There's some oddballs there for sure.

70
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,970
That's always going to be the case.
I think you're absolutely right.

71
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,370
That and about groups

72
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,460
you're always going have like outliers 
or strange strange,

73
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,683
but it's all right,
but the endurance racing in and of 

74
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:06,934
itself,
like the idea of pushing your body to 

75
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:09,094
the limits is a really fascinating sport
because pretty much everyone can ride a 

76
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:14,224
bike.
It's not like you're doing something 

77
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:18,010
like ballet where you.
I couldn't imagine doing,

78
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,953
you know,
I've watched like some people do like 

79
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:20,524
flips and gymnastics and stuff and I,
although I know the human body can do 

80
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:24,310
that.
I'm like,

81
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,140
yeah,
I can't see myself doing it,

82
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,780
but I can get on a bike.
That's all right.

83
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:31,090
The key is find something you like to do
and that you're good at.

84
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,860
You know,
my wife's a beautiful dancer.

85
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,611
I,
you know,

86
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:34,444
I've tried to dancing lessons with it.
I just can't do it and I just got two 

87
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:37,660
left feet.
Can't do it.

88
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,973
What I meant is though that it's one of 
those things where a normal person can 

89
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:43,400
do it,
so to,

90
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,343
but to do it the way a Lance Armstrong 
can do it or the way of Greg Lamon can 

91
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:48,754
do it.

92
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,623
You get into that weird area where you 
just tweaking every single aspect of 

93
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:54,760
your body,
the way you eat,

94
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:56,320
the way you sleep,
what you do,

95
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:57,920
your mental attitude,
your,

96
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,953
your motivation.
And did you get down that rabbit hole 

97
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,200
one?
Absolutely.

98
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,380
It's all I did,
you know,

99
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,300
just,
you know,

100
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,163
it was a 40 hour week but really more 
like a 60 hour a week job where you're 

101
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:09,070
training,
but you know,

102
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:09,560
uh,
it,

103
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,393
it,
there's a lot of preparation before you 

104
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:12,424
go out on a ride,
when you come back from a ride and then 

105
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:16,210
you add weights or stretching,
yoga,

106
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:17,840
whatever it ends up being,
you know,

107
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,560
an all day process.
How long did it take before you got into

108
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:23,710
all those people that are into epo and 
blood dope in?

109
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,560
When I was raised in the eighties,
there was no epo,

110
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:31,380
a blood doping was legal and it was done
by people I knew and the 84 Olympics,

111
00:04:31,381 --> 00:04:32,920
uh,
on the 84 Olympic team,

112
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:33,754
I know some of the people that did it,
they used their own blood or a 

113
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:36,850
relative's blood.

114
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,713
They just stored it and packed it in.
It wasn't even band until after the 84 

115
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:43,180
Olympics when it was found out.
The American team did it.

116
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,520
And then the,
uh,

117
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,583
the,
the,

118
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,900
whoever,
not that UCI,

119
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:48,070
the Olympic Committee said,
okay,

120
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:49,150
no,
no blood doping,

121
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,250
but it works.
I didn't try it.

122
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,510
A race across America is kind of a 
different sort of competition.

123
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:58,030
It's more of you against yourself and 
the in the clock,

124
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,190
you know,
you hardly ever see the other people out

125
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:01,810
there on the road.
So,

126
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:02,644
um,
and I wasn't into the idea of taking 

127
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:07,000
your blood out and packing it back in 
and sort of creeped me out.

128
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,190
And there were no drugs that you could 
take.

129
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:10,480
I mean,
things like steroids,

130
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:11,314
it's not going to do it for a cyclist.
It the miracle Vpo is that it packs in 

131
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:20,150
more red blood cells much faster than 
say trading at high altitude and uh,

132
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,590
and you don't have to do the creepy 
thing with story and bags of blood and,

133
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,890
and then the blood cells die or the 
blood gets infected.

134
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,640
Uh,
I mean I got Hep c when I was in college

135
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:31,474
and I had a back surgery.
I had a tumor on my spine and I had to 

136
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:36,820
have it taken out and I had been taking 
a lot of aspirin for pain.

137
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,580
It was in pain for years and so they had
to do this,

138
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,533
a blood transfusion in night.
This was 1976 and there was no test for 

139
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,120
this.
So I got Hep C.

140
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:47,680
and so after that I thought,
oh,

141
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,590
blood blood doping packing.
That just sort of creeped me out.

142
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,350
And there were people that were getting 
sick from blood doping know you take the

143
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,184
blood,
you put in a,

144
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,510
you store it,
maybe it's stored properly,

145
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:00,344
maybe it's not.
And then you get blood infections and 

146
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:02,970
that's not,
that's,

147
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:03,803
that's dangerous is Hep c the disease.
That was recently in the news because 

148
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,134
there was a young guy who owns some 
pharmaceutical company and they charged 

149
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:15,380
a ridiculous amount of money for it.

150
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,251
Yes,
correct.

151
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,990
Because you can get the.
I've been cured.

152
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,153
Know I'm a kaiser patient and I did it 
10 years ago and wiped it out within a 

153
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,780
month and I did the six month treatment 
and I've had been clear ever since.

154
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,150
But the drugs aren't that expensive if 
you do it through an Hmo,

155
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,633
they just.
It's just built into it should be part 

156
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:35,530
of your any healthcare system and so 
yeah,

157
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,383
somebody was doctoring the search,
cheating the system or something like 

158
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:38,930
that.
Yeah,

159
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,060
there was Jimmy,
you know the story behind it,

160
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:42,890
right?
That it was a young Martin.

161
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:44,510
Sure.
Kelly is that.

162
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,230
I think it was Hep c or HIV,
I think maybe some different,

163
00:06:49,231 --> 00:06:50,064
different medications.
He's got a company that works for a lot 

164
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:52,214
of pharmaceutical,
so it couldn't be both and the 

165
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,340
accusation once he was price gouging and
charging ridiculous.

166
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,590
It took you six months to get over a 
well,

167
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,790
my first blood test after a month of 
taking the,

168
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:05,923
the antiviral and the interferon was the
combination would they use 10 years ago 

169
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,480
and within the first blood test it was 
gone.

170
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,500
Undetectable.
They said,

171
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:13,334
yeah,
but you got to do the whole six month 

172
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,770
treatment.
That's our program.

173
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,700
All right.
So I did it.

174
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,023
Uh,
I was one of the fortunate ones that 

175
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:20,930
didn't get sick from the drugs.
Some people just are laid out,

176
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:24,380
they can't,
they can't do exercise or function,

177
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:25,214
but I didn't have any problems.
So you tested negative but they still 

178
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:29,360
made you continue the medication?
Yeah.

179
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,613
Is it because just because you're in a 
sort of a trials and it's like this is 

180
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:35,140
what we do.
You've got to do the six months.

181
00:07:35,141 --> 00:07:35,870
So.
All right.

182
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,351
Oh,
okay.

183
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:38,020
But he didn't mess with,
you know,

184
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,770
that was all right.
Yep.

185
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:40,911
So,
you know,

186
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:42,250
back then,
um,

187
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,403
that was the only thing you could do 
with was blood doping when epo was 

188
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:48,740
introduced in the early nineties,
that really made a big difference.

189
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,390
And as you know,
Greg,

190
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,980
I first discovered this when his 
teammates came to him a and said,

191
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:55,814
you know,
we found out these other guys are doing 

192
00:07:57,051 --> 00:07:57,500
this stuff.

193
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,750
We got to get on the program and he 
didn't want to do it.

194
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,390
And so by the time Lance got into the 
sport,

195
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,600
you know,
he didn't invent doping.

196
00:08:03,601 --> 00:08:05,440
I mean,
it was already ramping in,

197
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,870
it was full on cold coal,
full coal.

198
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,550
And only land stayed was like,
well,

199
00:08:09,551 --> 00:08:10,700
well,
if everybody's doing it,

200
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:11,534
we're going to do it.
We might as well do it at a really 

201
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,080
professional level.
And uh,

202
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:15,721
you know,
that's,

203
00:08:15,721 --> 00:08:16,554
that's where he sort of took it to 
another level and who knows if it's 

204
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:19,910
still going on.
Yeah.

205
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:21,830
I had him on the podcast and I watched 
it.

206
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:22,220
Yeah,
it was,

207
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,600
it was very enlightening.
Um,

208
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,350
I like him a lot.
You know,

209
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,090
he's an extreme winter and extreme 
winters are there.

210
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:29,924
They are the type of people that they 
just push everything to the outmost 

211
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,570
edge.
And that guy,

212
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:36,110
if everybody.

213
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,410
I've firmly believed that if everybody 
was 100 percent natural,

214
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,960
there was the same results,
probably would have had probably.

215
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,823
Yeah,
probably would have been different 

216
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:45,590
numbers as far as like the times 
achieved.

217
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,510
But I think he's still probably would 
have won it.

218
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,650
Probably.
Yes,

219
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,660
probably.
Probably is a bit.

220
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:51,520
It's a big word,
right?

221
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,340
Well,
and this is,

222
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,173
this is why it's still in a moral act 
because there are people that don't do 

223
00:08:56,491 --> 00:08:57,324
it or they don't want to do it and we'll
never know how they would've done 

224
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,470
compared to the people that are doping.
And um,

225
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,510
uh,
but again,

226
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,353
uh,
uh,

227
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,323
probably we know that all of the other 
people that were on the podium with 

228
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:08,844
lance for those seven years,
they all had been busted for dopey or 

229
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,070
admitted that they doped up.
So the outcome,

230
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:14,904
you know,
how far down do you go to give the 

231
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:16,584
Jersey and did 127th place guy or 
something because we know so many of 

232
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:20,934
them were doing it.

233
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,743
It's just so fascinating to me from a 
perspective of these guys are 

234
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:28,260
essentially experimenting with their 
bodies.

235
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:29,094
Trying to find the right levels,
trying to find out what's the best 

236
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:34,760
method to do so and along the entire,
you know,

237
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,550
the career that lance had,
you see all these adjustments that these

238
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:41,010
people are making and been trying to.
Well,

239
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:43,810
one of the early books at before all 
this came out about land.

240
00:09:43,811 --> 00:09:47,390
So it was called breaking the chain by 
Willie who was a,

241
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,800
um,
a sworn your or you know,

242
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:53,730
one of the people who give massage 
therapies to a or.

243
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:54,564
No,
I think it was one of the mechanics 

244
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:55,550
anyway,
with,

245
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,540
with the uh,
uh,

246
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,270
Festina team.
They got busted in [inaudible] 98 and he

247
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:03,090
said basically these guys were just 
experimenting randomly.

248
00:10:03,091 --> 00:10:04,800
No one knew what to do.
What's the dosage?

249
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:06,390
How many days,
every other day.

250
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:08,670
How do I incorporate the other things 
I'm doing?

251
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,710
What about food training?
It was just,

252
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,820
you know,
Katy bar the door.

253
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:13,910
Let's just try anything.
So again,

254
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,650
one of the things lance did was hire the
best doctor.

255
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,553
This mckelly Ferrari.
Know the business you got to knew the 

256
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:23,850
most about how to do it properly and 
adjust it for each body.

257
00:10:23,851 --> 00:10:25,710
Because everybody's body is different.
Okay,

258
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:26,900
so we're gonna try it,
you know,

259
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,913
you do this for months before the big 
race and figure it out and other people 

260
00:10:31,471 --> 00:10:32,304
weren't doing that.
And then by the time they scrambled to 

261
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,690
catch up,
tyler talks about this in his book,

262
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:37,524
you know,
after he left the postal team and got 

263
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:42,510
his own team and then of course Ferrari 
wasn't available.

264
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:46,890
So we hired this other guy flint days 
who screwed up and mix the bags of blood

265
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:48,840
and gave him the wrong drug.
And he got.

266
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,630
He got popped,
he said for what?

267
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,553
He was doping,
but he got popped for somebody else's 

268
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,860
dope.
Oh,

269
00:10:55,861 --> 00:10:57,600
because someone else's blood was in the 
system,

270
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,250
correct?
Right.

271
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,060
I think that's what it was.
And and really vote talks about this and

272
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:05,220
breaking the chain to about one of the 
guys that,

273
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:08,610
one of the early guys that got busted.
He.

274
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,473
Oh,
he used his mechanics urine for the 

275
00:11:10,831 --> 00:11:11,664
urine test,
which you store it in a little condom 

276
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:18,690
that's held underneath this little fake 
penis called the wizard.

277
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,613
Oh,
I've seen that because at the drug test 

278
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:24,190
you have to look and watch the Ip 
because just to make sure so you,

279
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,083
you do it in a way.
Just what the problem was that the 

280
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:30,090
mechanic had stayed up all night working
on the bikes and took some stimulants.

281
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,570
Stimulants are in the year and so this 
poor guy gets busted for something.

282
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:35,490
He didn't take course he was taking 
something else.

283
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,353
Oh yeah.
There's horror stories about this guy's 

284
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,150
putting bags of blood on the hook on 
the,

285
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,153
in the hotel room on the wall where the 
painting is that it drips down into 

286
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:45,260
your,
you know,

287
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,240
it's like,
no,

288
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,670
this is,
this is,

289
00:11:47,671 --> 00:11:48,920
you know,
really a,

290
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:49,783
a barbaric system when they,
in the early days when they were 

291
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:53,790
experimenting.
Uh,

292
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,753
so again went lance did was just take it
to another level since it's going on 

293
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,530
anyway.
We might as well do it professionally.

294
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,453
Okay.
And he would have gotten away with it 

295
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,160
because had he stayed retired,
but back to where you started,

296
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,320
it's,
you know,

297
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,153
when you're at that level and you push 
your body every day and you get all the 

298
00:12:10,301 --> 00:12:13,800
endorphins and the testosterone and the 
camaraderie with the guys.

299
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:14,800
It,
it's great.

300
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,663
It is so fun.
I still ride four or five days a week 

301
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:21,040
with the guys that I used to race with 
and friends in the area here and I,

302
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:21,874
you know,
if I missed three or four days a week 

303
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,660
traveling,
I'm just crawling out of my skin.

304
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,220
I just got to get back on.
Wow,

305
00:12:27,221 --> 00:12:28,450
that's interesting.
Yeah.

306
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:29,284
And I'm 62 years old,
so imagine your lance and you have the 

307
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:34,930
highest competitive edge,
probably anybody and,

308
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:38,170
and you're a super athlete and super 
gifted and then you're push,

309
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:38,681
push,
push,

310
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:40,840
and then you've got those seven straight
and then you retire.

311
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,730
And then what?
Golf.

312
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,670
Yeah.
It doesn't have the same intensity.

313
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,820
And so I completely understand why so 
many of these guys come back.

314
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,723
Remember,
Brett Farve came back a couple of times 

315
00:12:51,401 --> 00:12:52,580
and uh,
you know,

316
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,610
it's just hard to,
to,

317
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,750
to break that habit.
Yeah,

318
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,450
I see it all the time with fighters.
Unfortunately we're,

319
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,810
the consequences are much graver,
you know,

320
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,823
when you're older and your body doesn't 
respond the same way and you've already 

321
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:08,410
taken a lot of damage,
but yet you still have this Jonesing for

322
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:09,970
the spotlight and see them come back.

323
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,880
I mean,
they all have done it yet.

324
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,880
Sugar Ray,
Leonard,

325
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:16,510
Alia down the line and a lot of MMA 
fighters have done it as well.

326
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:17,620
It's just,
it's so,

327
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,790
it's the life,
you know,

328
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,110
you know,
you get Monday morning,

329
00:13:20,111 --> 00:13:23,260
I'm gonna do this workout,
I eat this and it's just a great pattern

330
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,094
to be and it feels great.
You're working toward this goal in six 

331
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:28,990
months or this is going to happen.
And then when that goal is gone,

332
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,741
it's like,
well,

333
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:30,574
why?
Why am I getting up at six in the 

334
00:13:31,181 --> 00:13:32,080
morning to this?
I mean,

335
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:33,880
I like doing that,
but I got to have a reason.

336
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,640
I mean,
Atlanta stayed retired,

337
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:39,130
probably be governor of Texas by now 
probably right?

338
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,390
So,
uh,

339
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:41,080
yeah,
but,

340
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,913
uh,
I mean he was so beloved when he was 

341
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:47,560
doing the live strong foundation and the
whole deal of trying to help people with

342
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:48,680
cancer and,
you know,

343
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,590
his own struggle overcoming cancer.

344
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,960
It's just such a crazy story.
Well,

345
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:54,390
and it really,
the,

346
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,263
the meltdown,
was it part of that Omerta rule and it 

347
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,930
works if,
if everyone has something to lose.

348
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,620
The problem was,
was um,

349
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,770
Floyd Landis,
you know,

350
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,570
he,
he got popped for the,

351
00:14:07,571 --> 00:14:10,930
his victory in the 2006 Tour de France 
for doping,

352
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,853
which he was.
And so he served his two years after a 

353
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:18,510
long struggle of denial and so forth.
And then he wanted to come back and he,

354
00:14:18,511 --> 00:14:19,840
and,
and he couldn't get hired.

355
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,180
And then he went to lance and said,
well,

356
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,400
you know,
can I be on the radio shack team?

357
00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:25,234
And apparently lance said no.
And so there he is standing there with 

358
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,530
nothing,
nothing to lose.

359
00:14:29,531 --> 00:14:31,780
So that's when he went to the press and 
said,

360
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:33,430
you know,
I know where the bodies are buried.

361
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,253
And uh,
you know,

362
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,310
that's where it got bad.

363
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,930
Remember that when that happened and 
Lance Hill,

364
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:39,120
that press conference,
you know,

365
00:14:39,121 --> 00:14:43,240
we like our story better than his story.
It's like wait stories.

366
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:46,320
He's got to start with just what 
happened and uh,

367
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:47,621
you know,
so,

368
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:49,240
uh,
and same thing with tyler,

369
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:50,680
you know,
he had nothing left to lose.

370
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,340
So he,
that book the secret race,

371
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:55,310
here's what we did and uh,
that blew it all open.

372
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,920
So how do you get into skepticism from 
there?

373
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,143
Well,
I was still teaching college at night 

374
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,870
while I was doing the bike race and 
stuff.

375
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,540
And uh,
then I,

376
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,890
I got burnout,
you know,

377
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,700
just the training and all that and 
decide,

378
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:09,410
okay,
I can't do this forever.

379
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,920
So I went back and got my phd in the 
history of science and uh,

380
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,360
and then I started,
I was teaching at Occidental College and

381
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,001
I was like,
okay,

382
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:17,930
I'm a college professor.

383
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,130
That's a great gig.
Uh,

384
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,530
it's a good life.
Uh,

385
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,120
but,
but then we started in my garage,

386
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:23,954
skeptic magazine and the lecture series 
at Caltech on science and pseudoscience 

387
00:15:27,471 --> 00:15:28,304
and cults and science and religion and 
alternative medicine and quackery and 

388
00:15:31,851 --> 00:15:32,684
all this stuff.
And,

389
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:37,330
and I thought that that's an interesting
niche to have and,

390
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,100
and so that just got bigger and bigger.
And my first book,

391
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,623
uh,
white people believe where things came 

392
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:44,960
out in [inaudible] 97 and at about that 
time,

393
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:45,794
Occidental college is going through a 
financial crisis and they were letting 

394
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:49,064
go their adjuncts,
which at the time I was not on a tenure 

395
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:51,614
track,
I was a full time adjunct and I could 

396
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:54,110
see the writing on the wall,
okay,

397
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,300
this may not end up being a tenure track
job.

398
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,583
And the skeptic thing was getting big 
and I got a big contract through my 

399
00:16:00,771 --> 00:16:01,900
agent for my second book.

400
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,391
So I thought,
okay,

401
00:16:02,391 --> 00:16:05,510
I'm just going to go for it.
I'm going to be a full time writer.

402
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:06,883
And it's a little risky.
But I had already done the risky thing 

403
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:09,290
of,
you know,

404
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,020
just dropping everything and doing the 
race across America steps.

405
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:12,471
I thought,
okay,

406
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,620
I can do it.
And this then became really my job.

407
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:18,530
I still teach one class a semester at 
Chapman,

408
00:16:18,531 --> 00:16:22,220
but my main job is writing books and 
running the society,

409
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:27,150
a publishing the magazine skeptic.
And it's kind of a niche market of a,

410
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,420
it's like my column in scientific 
American.

411
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:33,260
I cover the topics in there that aren't 
covered in the rest of the magazine,

412
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,463
like cancer quackery or like I'm working
on one now on a Charlie Sheen's a quack 

413
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,180
cancer doctor is aids doctor.
I mean,

414
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,960
he's got a quack cancer or aids.
Uh,

415
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,680
it's eight,
sorry.

416
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,180
Yeah.

417
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,020
Uh,
he,

418
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:50,570
you know,
he is tiger blood and all that,

419
00:16:50,571 --> 00:16:51,320
you know.
Well,

420
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,000
he doesn't have tiger.
There's no tiger blood.

421
00:16:53,001 --> 00:16:56,270
Okay.
So he got HIV and so he immediately went

422
00:16:56,271 --> 00:16:57,860
on the drug cocktail,
which works,

423
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,723
you know,
this is a miracle of modern medicine 

424
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:00,614
that kind of just sort of slipped by 
without anybody making a big fuss about 

425
00:17:03,621 --> 00:17:03,950
it,
you know,

426
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,783
t huge teams of medical researchers and 
they figured out the right cocktail and 

427
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:10,130
then you adjust it for each person and 
you can,

428
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,023
you can't get rid of the HIV virus,
but you'd knock it down so much that it 

429
00:17:14,841 --> 00:17:17,080
can't,
it doesn't cause the aids,

430
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,260
um,
symptoms.

431
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:20,980
You get pneumonia or whatever.
And,

432
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,670
and so,
um,

433
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,740
so he did that.
But then,

434
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,180
much to my amazement,
he,

435
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:27,014
uh,
uh,

436
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,430
Bill Maher on his show a couple of weeks
ago,

437
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:34,130
I had this guy on this guy from Mexico 
who has this cure for aids.

438
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,361
And,
uh,

439
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:37,250
if you take this,
um,

440
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:42,410
the blood of an arthritic goat,
so a goat that has arthritis,

441
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,440
how they determined,
I'm not sure that's allegedly charlie,

442
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:50,190
went to Mexico and,
and did the,

443
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:54,360
the arthritic goat's blood treatment and
it cured his aides.

444
00:17:54,361 --> 00:17:55,530
Well,
none of this is true.

445
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,020
Uh,
he stopped the drug cocktail.

446
00:17:58,021 --> 00:17:58,854
He went down there and stop the normal 
drug cocktail for AIDS HIV and it came 

447
00:18:03,721 --> 00:18:05,070
roaring back.
Of course,

448
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:05,963
if you don't keep taking the drugs,
the virus starts multiplying and it 

449
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,130
roars back in your body.
The goat,

450
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,083
the goat blood didn't work.
And then he came home and went back on 

451
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:14,994
the drug cocktail and he's fine now.
So he went down there to actually do 

452
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:19,560
this.
He went down there to do this.

453
00:18:19,561 --> 00:18:20,840
Well,
because he was probably told,

454
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,720
well,
he's probably scared.

455
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:22,930
I don't know.
But,

456
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,470
uh,
this is what I understand.

457
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,000
If there's already a drug cocktail that 
absolutely works,

458
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:31,500
why would you want to stay just to 
prevent the aids symptoms from coming on

459
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:32,334
from you getting the diseases you still 
had the HIV virus like magic knock it 

460
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:38,070
down to an almost undetectable level.
Yeah,

461
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,800
that's correct.
And that's should be good enough.

462
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,570
Well that's what Magic Johnson.
So it doesn't even show up in this.

463
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,510
That's right,
right.

464
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,340
Like if he gets tested right now he's 
HIV positive or a negative.

465
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:47,910
Right?
Right.

466
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:48,840
That's right.
Yup.

467
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,853
Even though they don't guarantee it just
in case it's hiding in the nooks and 

468
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,840
crannies of your nervous system or 
wherever.

469
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,370
Um,
so,

470
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,570
um,
yeah,

471
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:58,231
so that's,
you know,

472
00:18:58,231 --> 00:19:01,110
that's the kind of thing that scientific
American would normally cover,

473
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:01,944
but we would cover or conspiracy 
theories like the nine slash 11 truth 

474
00:19:04,961 --> 00:19:05,631
is,
you know,

475
00:19:05,631 --> 00:19:06,464
uh,
what about the free fall of the 

476
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,660
buildings and the puffs of smoke and the
this and that.

477
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,150
You know,
some of these are empirical questions we

478
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:12,984
can get at that,
that normal science journals wouldn't 

479
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:16,614
cover that we cover.
So skeptic has kind of a niche market 

480
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:21,930
for fringe claims.
Borderlands claims,

481
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,153
you know,
like,

482
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,010
like scientific American deals a lot 
with global climate change,

483
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:28,810
but they don't deal with the global 
warming deniers.

484
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,720
Who are these people,
what are their arguments?

485
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:32,250
So we would take on that and go,
okay,

486
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:35,340
here's their 10 arguments,
the best arguments they have,

487
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,090
and then here's the answers of how we 
know global warming is real,

488
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:39,924
how do you know it's human cause how do 
we know these things are normal science 

489
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:44,610
journalists don't have to deal with 
that.

490
00:19:44,611 --> 00:19:46,560
They are already down the path.
And I'm like okay,

491
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,300
what are we going to do about it?
And that sort of thing.

492
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,283
So that's kind of our specialty.
Well it's an important resource because 

493
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,870
whether it's global warming or nine 
slash 11 truther and there's just,

494
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:55,723
there's so much confusion out there when
it comes to trying to figure out what's 

495
00:19:58,831 --> 00:19:59,640
real and what's not real.

496
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,740
Someone sends you a link,
you know like what is this?

497
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,870
And it's a youtube video.
You go to the youtube,

498
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,010
you are being lied to.
What the Hell is going on?

499
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,220
What you don't know what's going on.
And then you watch it,

500
00:20:11,221 --> 00:20:15,440
like global warming is just one of the 
many ones that,

501
00:20:15,441 --> 00:20:17,250
uh,
that confuse the shit out of people.

502
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:18,270
And then,
you know,

503
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:19,104
then you find out that there's companies
that actually have a vested interest in 

504
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,640
confusing people.
Like,

505
00:20:23,641 --> 00:20:25,710
have you ever seen that documentary 
merchants of doubt?

506
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,551
I'm in it.
Oh,

507
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:27,360
that's right.
Yes.

508
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,193
I'm in it.
Yeah.

509
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:32,940
I asking you that many documentaries 
officially to that,

510
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,300
the beauty of that,
a film made by a candidate that is now a

511
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,910
friend of mine.
It was very clever because,

512
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:39,744
um,
he tracked down the same scientists who 

513
00:20:42,061 --> 00:20:45,690
were hired by the tobacco companies.
Not just the same arguments,

514
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,920
you know,
planting a seed.

515
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,993
Some of the times the same people paid 
by these front groups and they'd know 

516
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:52,684
how to do it through.
It's so theatrical the way they present 

517
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:55,234
their arguments.
It's one of the reasons why I've always 

518
00:20:55,991 --> 00:20:56,824
hated those.
Those tough television shows where you 

519
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:00,250
have a,
you know,

520
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:01,330
a,
a host,

521
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:02,164
and then you have the split window.
One person talking over them on this 

522
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:07,720
side and one person is on the left,
one person isn't the right,

523
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:09,410
literally and figuratively.
Right?

524
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,980
They're yelling at each other and you 
never get anything done.

525
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:12,814
You never figured out anything.
But the person who's better at 

526
00:21:14,831 --> 00:21:17,610
expressing that opinion in a real quick,
you know,

527
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,320
three or four minute soundbite of 
interview,

528
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,493
they get their argument across and 
that's what these merchants of doubt 

529
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:24,760
guys were doing.
That's right.

530
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:26,000
Yep.
They got the sound bites.

531
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:26,834
Uh,
the science is not all in the jury is 

532
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,124
still out.

533
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,300
What jury,
where you know it.

534
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,220
It's almost like there's a science are 
that calls all the shots.

535
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:37,960
And if we can just find out what's going
on there,

536
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:38,741
we're going to put us,
you know,

537
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:41,050
we're going to blow this stuff that 
isn't how it works.

538
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:41,884
There's 10,000
climate scientists working in all these 

539
00:21:43,421 --> 00:21:47,260
labs and their findings converge to the 
same conclusion.

540
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,533
So for there to be conspiracy,
they'd all have to be meeting on the 

541
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:51,280
weekends going,
okay,

542
00:21:51,281 --> 00:21:52,920
I'm going to say that the,
you know,

543
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,270
the parts per million of this particular
gas is this,

544
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:57,280
what are you going to say?
This is not how it works.

545
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,353
It's a very competitive enterprise.
If you want to make a name for yourself 

546
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,253
and you're a young scientist just 
debunking one of these arguments about 

547
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,830
tree ring data or the ice core data,
which would be huge.

548
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:11,330
And they try it,
you know,

549
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,700
it's like the people saying,
you know,

550
00:22:12,701 --> 00:22:13,800
Einstein was wrong.

551
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,290
Well,
okay,

552
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:17,020
there's been 100 years of scientists 
testing Einstein.

553
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:19,480
If he was wrong,
we would know by now,

554
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:20,650
oh no,
they all,

555
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,350
they're all conspiring to cover the 
truth.

556
00:22:23,351 --> 00:22:24,580
No,
that isn't how it works.

557
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,370
There's also this appeal or this,
this,

558
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,360
this.
For some reason people are drawn to this

559
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:36,110
idea of being a no nonsense person.
You know the no nonsense person.

560
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:39,020
You believe in Al Gore,
you believe that you have,

561
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,350
if you've seen an inconvenient truth and
then.

562
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,673
But I find that when I talked to these 
people that like really dismiss global 

563
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:49,780
climate change or dismiss a lot of 
people's concerns about those things,

564
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,840
they haven't really researched it that 
much.

565
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:53,674
There so definitive on their ideas,
but they haven't really researched it 

566
00:22:56,351 --> 00:22:58,960
that much,
but they don't want to be a fool.

567
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:04,330
That seems to be a lot of the appeal to 
them to take this hard stance.

568
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,670
It's like they don't want to be one of 
those fools.

569
00:23:06,671 --> 00:23:07,630
What do you hippie?
Yeah.

570
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,900
By buy of that nonsense.
Yeah.

571
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:10,930
Yeah.
It's,

572
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:11,980
it,
it's partly that,

573
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,250
like one of the appeals of conspiracy 
theories is,

574
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,133
you know,
we're going to blow the lid off and I'm 

575
00:23:17,921 --> 00:23:21,850
not being fooled by the,
I know the Bush administration light and

576
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:23,040
as yet.
And we're going to.

577
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,173
Yeah.
So I mean that's one of the appeals of 

578
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:27,550
the nine slash 11 truth movement is 
that,

579
00:23:27,551 --> 00:23:29,230
you know,
we know what really happened and,

580
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,000
and you know,
Bush lied,

581
00:23:31,001 --> 00:23:31,834
okay,
well maybe lied about this little thing 

582
00:23:33,251 --> 00:23:36,400
or maybe it was misdirection or get bad 
information.

583
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:37,234
But the idea of orchestrating an entire 
event like nine slash 11 and 

584
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,840
coordinating the flying of the planes 
into buildings and you know,

585
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,943
what did they do with the passengers and
how did get the people into the World 

586
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,133
Trade Center buildings to break open the
drywall and plant the explosive devices 

587
00:23:51,591 --> 00:23:52,424
without anybody noticing how many 
thousands of people would have to be 

588
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:55,070
involved.

589
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,290
You think the federal government could 
pull it off?

590
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,930
Something like that when they couldn't 
even do Watergate.

591
00:23:59,931 --> 00:24:01,340
I mean,
here it's just a hotel.

592
00:24:01,341 --> 00:24:03,320
Break it.
I forgot to bring in a book for.

593
00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:04,154
You.
Damn it.

594
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,293
I have a doctorate.
He's sort of a doctor is really a weed 

595
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,550
doctor is a doctor that prescribes my 
medical marijuana.

596
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,570
I get headaches.
Getting one right now.

597
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,293
Anyway,
he gave me this book when I went to 

598
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:16,454
visit him and it was a book about Tesla 
Technology that was used to take down 

599
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:23,060
the twin towers.
Oh,

600
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,760
I don't know this sitting in the 
doctor's office,

601
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:26,291
boy.
Oh,

602
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:30,350
he's fucking telling me about this 
technology.

603
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:31,120
That what,
what,

604
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,880
what,
what?

605
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,670
Have you ever seen the turns concrete 
into dust,

606
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,041
right?
Well,

607
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,010
you know,
concretes,

608
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,290
it starts out as powder talking about 
millions of tons of,

609
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:44,330
of a building that's compressed and 
falling down.

610
00:24:44,331 --> 00:24:44,480
Yeah.

611
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,840
I would imagine there'd be a bunch of 
dust for awhile.

612
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,680
Thermite was the big thing there.
Might will melt the.

613
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,953
Okay.
So then there were tests done and the 

614
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:55,670
thermite and it doesn't burn hot enough 
to get through a whole huge beam.

615
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,833
Okay.
Well they have I think just cut through 

616
00:24:57,381 --> 00:24:58,910
an engine block with that stuff though,
right?

617
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,230
Yeah.
But these beams are like,

618
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,360
you know,
the size of this table,

619
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,640
but if it had a lot of thermite well 
but.

620
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,540
So then they say,
well it's super thermite.

621
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,390
Well it's like,
well where is this super thermal?

622
00:25:08,391 --> 00:25:10,460
I never heard of it.
Well it's secret super secret.

623
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:15,580
Super thermite pieces of evidence that 
they were using or like the cuts,

624
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,893
the angular cuts on the beams.
Well that was actually done after the 

625
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,530
buildings had color.
Right.

626
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:27,110
They were trying to clean it up.
They had to cut some of them down and so

627
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:28,340
they were using these photos.

628
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,160
So there was a lot of confusion.
Okay,

629
00:25:31,161 --> 00:25:32,150
you sit.
But the thing is,

630
00:25:32,151 --> 00:25:35,180
you don't need to know anything about 
thermite or tesla technology.

631
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,220
We know that the planes hit the 
buildings.

632
00:25:37,221 --> 00:25:39,530
You can see it on video,
you could see which floors they were at,

633
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,980
the angle of the wings and so forth for 
that to have happened.

634
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:43,903
And explosive devices planted at the 
exact floors where they knew ahead of 

635
00:25:49,911 --> 00:25:53,530
time what floors and what angle.
The plane right there stop.

636
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,490
Full Stop,
you know,

637
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,540
that can't be well,
it's very,

638
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:57,830
very,
very unlikely.

639
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:03,410
Super Unlikely not to mention a g Gordon
Liddy once told me about Watergate,

640
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,310
the,
you know,

641
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,233
the competency problem and the,
and the people can't keep their mouth 

642
00:26:07,641 --> 00:26:08,620
shut problem,
you know,

643
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,790
uh,
the more people you have involved,

644
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:15,940
the more they're going to screw up or 
chicken out or change their mind or then

645
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,980
tell their friends and lovers and so 
forth.

646
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,853
You know,
I know the guy that did it and pretty 

647
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:23,970
soon they're on your show telling about 
what they saw Haka.

648
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,430
No one's come out to say,
you know,

649
00:26:25,431 --> 00:26:26,264
I was sitting there in my office and I 
saw these guys breaking through the dry 

650
00:26:29,341 --> 00:26:31,860
wall.
And putting these things inside that you

651
00:26:31,861 --> 00:26:32,694
know,
so I mean someone like Jesse Ventura 

652
00:26:33,681 --> 00:26:35,570
thing,
so it was all done under the cover of a,

653
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,540
of a fixing the elevators in the world 
trade center,

654
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,543
fixing the elevators.
I mean this would have had to gone for 

655
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:44,010
weeks and weeks and I don't

656
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,720
know if Jesse Ventura really believes 
that.

657
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:50,040
He says this,
he's selling conspiracy.

658
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:50,874
Now I have A.
There's a bunch of people that 

659
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:56,520
conspiracy becomes a business and like 
Alex Jones,

660
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,220
who's a friend of mine and he's out of 
his fucking mind.

661
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,710
I know he believes this stuff.
Or does he just say stuff?

662
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,810
Just to see what comes out.
He believes a lot,

663
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,300
but he gets a lot of things right.
That's what's unfortunate.

664
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:10,110
The unfortunate thing about conspiracies
is that it's not all cut and dry.

665
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:10,983
There was things like operation 
northwoods where the government really 

666
00:27:13,051 --> 00:27:16,740
did plan on orchestrating these 
artificial attacks,

667
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,783
arming Cuban friendlies a bay.
They're going to blow up a jetliner and 

668
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,720
blaming on Cuba.
There were real actual conspiring or con

669
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,033
conspiracies that we can prove.
This is the problem with the nine slash 

670
00:27:32,941 --> 00:27:33,471
11.
Truth is,

671
00:27:33,471 --> 00:27:34,304
or the extreme conspiracy theories,
they're missing where the real action 

672
00:27:37,201 --> 00:27:38,011
is,
you know,

673
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:38,844
all those third world dictators we were 
supporting in the seventies under 

674
00:27:41,551 --> 00:27:43,930
Kissinger and Nixon,
all real.

675
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,760
This stuff happened and that's it.
It's not as sexy as,

676
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:48,594
you know,
taking over the world are running the 

677
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,230
world economy,
but it's,

678
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,450
it's real and it's affected over in 
north.

679
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,291
I mean,
remember that,

680
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:56,160
I mean the,
when,

681
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,650
when that was going on with the ads,
that conspiracy,

682
00:27:58,651 --> 00:28:00,600
that's a real conspiracy.
There's a real,

683
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,590
there's real ones,
you know.

684
00:28:01,591 --> 00:28:02,424
And then there was a real one that was 
apparently being planned by Dick Cheney 

685
00:28:04,861 --> 00:28:06,240
on the way out.
You know,

686
00:28:06,241 --> 00:28:08,190
they were planning on doing something 
with Iran.

687
00:28:08,191 --> 00:28:10,050
They were planning on some sort of a 
false flag.

688
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,423
But when people look at operation 
northwoods and they look at that where 

689
00:28:13,531 --> 00:28:14,364
it would have cost American lives,
they had a real conspiracy that 

690
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:17,394
President Kennedy vetoed.
That was actually signed by the Joint 

691
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,990
Chiefs of staff that gets,
it gets the Bay of pigs.

692
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,150
That was a conspiracy.
Yeah.

693
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,140
So there,
there have been real conspiracy,

694
00:28:25,141 --> 00:28:25,530
right?

695
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,240
So they look at nine slash 11,
they go,

696
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:29,220
this is the grand one,
the big one,

697
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,173
right?
So how can we tell the difference 

698
00:28:31,261 --> 00:28:32,450
between the real ones that.
Well,

699
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,570
okay,
well,

700
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,340
so there's certain criteria.
Again,

701
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:40,000
the grander the theory is,
the less likely it is a real conspiracy,

702
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:43,800
global domination running the world's 
economy,

703
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,120
these sorts of things.
Well,

704
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:45,954
how about the big Alex Jones one?
They want to cut the population down to 

705
00:28:48,631 --> 00:28:50,940
like 500 million people worldwide.
Yeah.

706
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,350
Well that,
that could,

707
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,730
that could happen naturally if we just,
uh,

708
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,873
uh,
educated women made them economically 

709
00:28:57,451 --> 00:28:59,880
empowered and had access to birth 
control,

710
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,793
you know,
that's the solution to they 

711
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:03,090
overpopulation.
You really think that would work.

712
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,650
People still want babies.
Well,

713
00:29:04,651 --> 00:29:05,131
they do,
yes,

714
00:29:05,131 --> 00:29:06,900
of course.
But the replacement level,

715
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,223
there are a number of countries below 
the replacement level and we know what 

716
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:12,210
the factors are,
the things I just said,

717
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:13,044
you know,
just being,

718
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,083
being a prosperous democracy in which 
women had the franchise and they're 

719
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:20,760
economically empowered and educated and 
they have access to birth control.

720
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,140
Family planning happens naturally.
You don't have to do the China one child

721
00:29:25,141 --> 00:29:26,280
rule,
you don't have to do that.

722
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:28,350
It happens naturally.
So if you're,

723
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:29,184
if you're a pro life,
so called pro life and you're against 

724
00:29:30,841 --> 00:29:31,674
abortion,
that and you want to reduce the amount 

725
00:29:33,631 --> 00:29:36,180
of abortions,
just educate women and giving them power

726
00:29:36,181 --> 00:29:39,420
and give them choice and access to birth
control and it happens naturally.

727
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,770
Yeah,
that's a weird statistic,

728
00:29:41,771 --> 00:29:42,040
isn't

729
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,500
it?
That the more prosperous cities become,

730
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:45,334
the more the civilization becomes 
advanced as far as like education and 

731
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:49,863
technology.

732
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,010
You get less birth rate.
That's right.

733
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,280
So it's [inaudible] Uzi and malthus was 
wrong.

734
00:29:54,281 --> 00:29:55,114
And,
and,

735
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:59,020
and Paul Ehrlich with the population 
bomb wrong and they're still modern.

736
00:29:59,021 --> 00:30:01,910
Neil Matthews that are claiming this 
today,

737
00:30:01,911 --> 00:30:03,160
you know,
the club of Rome,

738
00:30:03,161 --> 00:30:05,740
the limits of growth and all this stuff.
No,

739
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,730
no,
no.

740
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,820
Uh,
if you want to get a population lower,

741
00:30:09,821 --> 00:30:12,760
just make the people super prosperous,
especially the women.

742
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,773
And it just happens naturally.
And the reason is because one reason 

743
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:17,434
people have so many babies in poor 
countries is because they're not likely 

744
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:23,080
to survive the debate.
The babies die.

745
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,960
And so you got to have lots of them to 
get your jeans out there,

746
00:30:25,961 --> 00:30:28,810
so to speak.
So it's sort of a biological impulse.

747
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,000
And then also to take care of you when 
you're old,

748
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,133
you better,
you better have six or 10 just to make 

749
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:36,820
sure there's a couple left when year old
to support you.

750
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,560
You don't need to do any of that when 
you have a prosperous economy.

751
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,470
The effect

752
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:45,810
though is it's so scary as far as the 
overpopulation effect,

753
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:50,660
when we look at the raw numbers from 
like 1970 versus 2016 worldwide,

754
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,930
but it's not that long ago in our 
lifetime while I was alive,

755
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,580
the population has more than doubled.
And in the United States,

756
00:30:58,581 --> 00:31:01,130
just in the United States.
And forget about poor countries.

757
00:31:01,131 --> 00:31:02,990
We've got about China.
Forget about India,

758
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,580
you know?

759
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,413
Yes,
correct.

760
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,530
Correct.
So there's,

761
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:06,364
you know,
as the population pig works its way 

762
00:31:08,981 --> 00:31:12,130
through the python demographic,
python,

763
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:15,460
it's going to take a while to catch up.
So already country,

764
00:31:15,461 --> 00:31:17,620
there's a number of countries that are 
below replacement level,

765
00:31:17,621 --> 00:31:19,510
but what countries are below that?
Well,

766
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:20,890
Japan,
Sweden,

767
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,810
Russia.
Uh,

768
00:31:22,811 --> 00:31:23,644
I don't know.
There's at least a dozen in mostly 

769
00:31:25,811 --> 00:31:26,644
northern European countries and that 
means that their population is still 

770
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:34,291
growing by the momentum of past decades,
but the current generation will have,

771
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,940
you know,
one point nine children on average.

772
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:37,803
Two point one is the replacement level 
and I forget how many kinds of 20 

773
00:31:40,241 --> 00:31:42,670
something countries are below two point 
one replacement level,

774
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,773
but it'll take till about 20 slash 50 
before we see the topping off of the 

775
00:31:47,081 --> 00:31:49,270
population growth and then start to go 
back down.

776
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,163
It's one reason you almost never see the
curves after 20 slash 50 because if 

777
00:31:53,141 --> 00:31:57,400
you're a pro environmentalist or pr pro,
anti population organization,

778
00:31:57,401 --> 00:32:00,700
you don't want to show the good news 
from 2050 to 2100,

779
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:03,190
but the UN two of the three you and 
projections,

780
00:32:03,191 --> 00:32:08,191
they have like a conservative middle and
in and then I'm more radical projections

781
00:32:08,381 --> 00:32:13,381
and that by 2100,
the modest middle one shows us back down

782
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:18,220
to around probably six or 7 billion from
will hit a peak of nine or 10 billion in

783
00:32:18,221 --> 00:32:21,010
2050 back down to where we are now in 
2100.

784
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:24,010
And then by 2100,
maybe one or 2 billion,

785
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:24,963
if,
if,

786
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:25,803
Yep,
it could down to one or two that this 

787
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:31,150
could happen just by if.
I mean there's so many variables,

788
00:32:31,151 --> 00:32:31,984
it's hard to predict,
but that could happen if everybody is 

789
00:32:33,941 --> 00:32:35,320
prosperous,
particularly Africa.

790
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:38,950
So one of the things the gates 
foundation is trying to do is just solve

791
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,100
certain basic,

792
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,480
simple problems.
And,

793
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,960
and the UN is trying to get rid of these
corrupt governments.

794
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:45,823
That's what's holding them back.
There's enough food to feed 7 billion 

795
00:32:48,651 --> 00:32:50,150
people.
It's the distribution.

796
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,220
That's the problem.
The Green Revolution,

797
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:55,140
Norman Borlaug and the green revolution 
salt,

798
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:57,530
you know,
we have the technology to do at Gmos are

799
00:32:57,531 --> 00:33:01,050
good for feeding poor people.
I'm a sub,

800
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:05,210
but it's the corrupt dictatorships that 
prevent the distribution of the food and

801
00:33:05,211 --> 00:33:06,044
resources and keeps the population from 
being prosperous so they have more 

802
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:09,794
children.
So that,

803
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,960
in my opinion,
that's the longterm solution.

804
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,520
So there's two things there.
One,

805
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,383
there's the conspiracy by the elites to 
hide the fact that we're going to get 

806
00:33:18,231 --> 00:33:21,140
down to 2 billion people by 2100.
We got that.

807
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,830
Well,
it's the environmentalist,

808
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:24,863
they're hiding it hit,
we don't know for sure this is going to 

809
00:33:28,311 --> 00:33:29,660
happen.
These are projections,

810
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:33,020
but then there's also the food 
distribution,

811
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,570
a conversation,
which is a very fascinating one.

812
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,760
You know,
I had these guys on from the documentary

813
00:33:37,761 --> 00:33:40,130
cowspiracy,
which is well intended,

814
00:33:40,131 --> 00:33:40,964
but apparently got a bunch of stuff 
wrong about how many acres it takes to 

815
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:48,420
have a cow graze,
like how much I'm going to,

816
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:52,600
what are the requirements and what you 
can do with veganism versus what it was.

817
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:56,300
Essentially they were really heavily 
biased and promoting a vegan lifestyle,

818
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:57,260
which is their choice.
You know,

819
00:33:57,261 --> 00:34:00,290
they could do that,
but that's the big argument today.

820
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:02,570
It's like,
do we have enough land?

821
00:34:02,571 --> 00:34:05,270
Do we have enough resources to feed all 
the people?

822
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,820
My conversation has always been like,
okay,

823
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,700
are we doing it right now?
Yes,

824
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,830
we're all eating right,
especially the United States.

825
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,733
Okay,
well you know,

826
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,740
we are running out of land.
We are running out of food.

827
00:34:15,741 --> 00:34:17,420
We are running out of this.
The Sky is falling,

828
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,420
but are okay.
Are we doing it right now?

829
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,060
Are we feeding ourselves right now?
We are right,

830
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,480
you are really easily,
in fact,

831
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,750
problem.
We have a surplus,

832
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:28,843
plenty of food.
Not to say that a lot of the methods 

833
00:34:30,591 --> 00:34:32,770
we're using aren't disgusting.
Like factory farming.

834
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,430
Farming is terrible,
horrible and the,

835
00:34:34,431 --> 00:34:38,030
and then a lot of laws to protect them 
or disgusting to like the Ag gag laws.

836
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:42,230
Those are viable,
but why can't we keep doing it?

837
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,540
And then then the argument kind of falls
apart.

838
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,260
Well we were gonna we're gonna run out 
of stuff.

839
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,491
Well,
okay.

840
00:34:49,491 --> 00:34:51,590
So in the long run we want to get off 
the factory farming.

841
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:54,290
It is according to disgusting habit.
And the poly farms,

842
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:54,921
you know,
the happy,

843
00:34:54,921 --> 00:34:56,120
I call them the happy farms,
you know,

844
00:34:56,121 --> 00:34:56,954
wherever Joel Salatin,
every cow has a name and there's the 

845
00:34:59,601 --> 00:35:01,240
happy chicken running around.
Yeah,

846
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:04,400
that gets killed that yeah,
he has a great life until that last day.

847
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,243
So yeah,
those kinds of farms cannot support 7 

848
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,653
billion people.
So in the long run we have to get the 

849
00:35:13,671 --> 00:35:14,504
numbers down somewhat.
And also the technology of synthetic 

850
00:35:17,301 --> 00:35:18,800
meat,
we just getting there.

851
00:35:18,801 --> 00:35:19,840
It's a,
you know,

852
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,680
I think we're not five years away.
I think,

853
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:22,220
you know,
we're,

854
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,053
we're maybe a couple of decades away.
You don't think it's possible to get a 

855
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,190
significant number of the people in this
country to go vegan?

856
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,320
No,
I don't think that's gonna happen in the

857
00:35:30,321 --> 00:35:31,154
moral arc.
I have a chapter on animal rights in 

858
00:35:32,151 --> 00:35:32,984
which I show that the numbers are still 
in single digits or even with all the 

859
00:35:36,231 --> 00:35:38,010
environmental movement and all the,
you

860
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,791
know,
vegetarian,

861
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:39,541
pro,
vegetarian.

862
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:40,374
It's still less than 10 percent.
It's more like six or seven percent of 

863
00:35:43,231 --> 00:35:45,150
the population,
the population in the United States.

864
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:45,984
And so I liked the reduce attarian 
movements and new word reduce attarian 

865
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:49,470
let's just,
you know,

866
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:53,940
meatless Mondays just just cut it down 
and try to,

867
00:35:53,941 --> 00:35:55,440
you know,
if you shop at whole foods,

868
00:35:55,441 --> 00:35:57,730
you know,
get the happy farm meat,

869
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,710
you know,
that sort of thing.

870
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,330
Um,
you know,

871
00:36:00,331 --> 00:36:01,990
obviously if you can afford a whole 
foods,

872
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:05,910
I know it's not okay.
So in the long run,

873
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,793
you know,
markets will drive down prices of say a 

874
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,040
synthetic meat.
Right now,

875
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:13,380
you know,
a little patty made out of stem cells is

876
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:16,080
thousand dollars,
but you know,

877
00:36:16,081 --> 00:36:16,914
that course,
that's what computers were in the 

878
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,410
forties.
And so now look,

879
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:24,120
and then this will happen,
but not in five years or 10 years.

880
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,980
And so the idea of like,
well in the meantime,

881
00:36:25,981 --> 00:36:27,150
let's get everybody to go vegan.

882
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:30,050
This isn't also isn't going to happen.
Why you,

883
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,760
why don't you think it's going to 
happen?

884
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,420
Uh,
I think first of all,

885
00:36:33,421 --> 00:36:35,250
we,
we have a habit of eating meat.

886
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:36,960
It tastes great.
Most people like it.

887
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,130
Uh,
you,

888
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,320
you can get your protein from other 
sources.

889
00:36:40,321 --> 00:36:42,090
I don't think that's a viable argument 
anymore,

890
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,440
but,
but most people,

891
00:36:43,441 --> 00:36:46,830
they just like it and it's culturally 
has still has a lot of momentum.

892
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:50,540
I think it's one thing to get people to 
care about global warming or yeah,

893
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,260
let's drive electric cars,
whatever.

894
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,250
You don't have to give up something 
that,

895
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,040
that you really,
really like,

896
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,590
but food,
people really like their meat.

897
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,513
And uh,
I,

898
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,533
I,
I would be okay if everybody went that 

899
00:37:02,341 --> 00:37:04,560
way,
but I'm not quite there yet myself.

900
00:37:04,561 --> 00:37:06,830
I still have meat now and then,
but I've,

901
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:11,580
I've reduced it considerably compared to
before was the ethical considerations of

902
00:37:11,581 --> 00:37:14,350
the reason why people think that it's a 
good way to go and not,

903
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,620
not necessarily protein wise or.

904
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,830
I mean there's,
there's a,

905
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,030
there's a bunch of people that argue 
that the,

906
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,890
it's very difficult to get the same 
amount of protein,

907
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,920
but then there's also people that argue 
that you really don't need the amount of

908
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:28,170
protein the most people consume anyway.
Right.

909
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,510
Well,
you can try to change behavior.

910
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,270
Okay.
Nudge people with incentives,

911
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,770
but why not also go the path of the 
technological solutions,

912
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,880
synthetic meat,
you know,

913
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,950
people are working on this,
there are companies doing it,

914
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,053
you know,
funded by a venture capitalists in 

915
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,223
Google.
One of the google x projects is to do 

916
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:48,750
this.
Again,

917
00:37:48,751 --> 00:37:49,350
I think it's,
you know,

918
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,820
it's maybe it's like self driving cars 
know it's just,

919
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,540
it's going to take a few decades before 
everybody is there,

920
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,740
but I'm optimistic because we're at 
least moving in that direction.

921
00:37:59,160 --> 00:37:59,993
Yeah.
I think that's a real possibility of 

922
00:38:01,291 --> 00:38:04,860
headless animals that we've engineered 
and the labs and that's where we get our

923
00:38:04,861 --> 00:38:08,280
food from.
But what will it be as good for you?

924
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,450
Well,
it tastes as good.

925
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:13,340
Well that a principle that should just 
be a scientific western.

926
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,213
Right?
We know what,

927
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,270
what's in inmate.
Okay.

928
00:38:15,271 --> 00:38:17,700
So just put it in there.
And your synthetic meat,

929
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:21,960
just design it with your designer jeans,
I guess.

930
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:22,883
I mean,
but there's a big difference between 

931
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:29,130
cows that eat certain diets versus cows 
eat grass fed cows versus health wise.

932
00:38:29,131 --> 00:38:29,964
As far as the,
uh,

933
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,283
there was a study that was released 
recently showing the benefits of grass 

934
00:38:34,221 --> 00:38:36,490
fed beef versus

935
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,370
corn fed beef just health wise.
Yep.

936
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,051
Yep.
So,

937
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:41,741
you know,
I don't know.

938
00:38:41,741 --> 00:38:42,690
We'll see.
Yeah.

939
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:46,090
Because I'm curious.
I mean if they do create synthetic meat,

940
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:48,910
will,
will it have the same properties?

941
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,793
I,
I would imagine you could even build in 

942
00:38:50,771 --> 00:38:51,604
marbling,
just put fat cells in there to make it 

943
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,690
juicy or something.
And maybe that won't be as healthy,

944
00:38:55,691 --> 00:38:56,920
but maybe you think,
well I don't care.

945
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,450
Yeah.
But I would be,

946
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,350
you know,
I mean,

947
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:02,170
there's a difference between the way it 
tastes like a marble,

948
00:39:02,171 --> 00:39:07,171
like a fat from a grass fed cow versus 
the fat from a corn fed cow versus a fat

949
00:39:07,571 --> 00:39:08,404
from a lab built cow going to be yet 
it's also just habit of what you used 

950
00:39:13,631 --> 00:39:14,860
to.
I love red meat,

951
00:39:14,861 --> 00:39:17,740
but I almost never eat it anymore.
I really don't miss it.

952
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,230
Uh,
you just kind of get into the pattern of

953
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,640
change in your diet and it,
I think,

954
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,800
I think we could get there.

955
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:24,963
I just don't think that that's the only 
avenue to solving the factory farming 

956
00:39:28,301 --> 00:39:30,940
problem.
I think lowering the population,

957
00:39:30,941 --> 00:39:32,910
synthetic meat,
changing behavior,

958
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,050
just come at it from a bunch of 
different angles.

959
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,750
Um,
that's of the case with every problem,

960
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:38,800
right?
Absolutely.

961
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,400
So I call that,
I call it in the moral of that Protopian

962
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:43,370
solutions.
Uh,

963
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,220
Kevin Kelly,
the founder of wired magazine,

964
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:47,590
he used this term protopia small 
changes,

965
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,650
tiny little bit of progress.
It's like last year's nab system,

966
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,020
uh,
and this year's Nav system in your car,

967
00:39:53,021 --> 00:39:53,854
this one slightly better.
It has this little feature and this 

968
00:39:54,971 --> 00:39:55,730
little thing,
you know,

969
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,370
and,
and over many years and decades,

970
00:39:57,371 --> 00:40:01,390
all of a sudden you've got a super smart
car versus the Jalopies of the fifties,

971
00:40:01,391 --> 00:40:02,950
not a flying car.
You don't go from,

972
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:03,933
you know,
the Jalopy to the flying car and one 

973
00:40:05,381 --> 00:40:08,710
year you go to what we have now 
incrementally.

974
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,680
And that's true in all technologies.
You know,

975
00:40:10,681 --> 00:40:12,640
it's like the Mac just keeps,
you know,

976
00:40:12,641 --> 00:40:14,160
I've been buying Max for,
you know,

977
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:17,410
25 years.
He since the late eighties and it's a 30

978
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:19,780
and a,
it's the same pay,

979
00:40:19,781 --> 00:40:20,720
the same price.
You have to,

980
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,180
you got 2,400
bucks,

981
00:40:22,181 --> 00:40:23,014
you get pretty much the same.
Double the computer for the same price 

982
00:40:24,971 --> 00:40:25,804
every three years.
And that's what most technologies go 

983
00:40:28,811 --> 00:40:30,400
through.
Yeah.

984
00:40:30,401 --> 00:40:32,920
Well I think that's one of the cool 
things about following it.

985
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,793
You know,
one of the things that's so fascinating 

986
00:40:34,691 --> 00:40:36,820
to me about following technology is like
woo,

987
00:40:36,821 --> 00:40:41,821
Samsung has the new galaxy s nine.
It's waterproof and it can show the moon

988
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,810
these days are there.
They're so interesting to see where this

989
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,490
innovation is going and when the 
innovation is,

990
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,543
you know,
when it's things like mean essentially 

991
00:40:51,221 --> 00:40:53,500
I've made the argument that the view 
leaf cell phones alone,

992
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:55,480
if everyone's making cell phones right 
now,

993
00:40:55,481 --> 00:40:57,550
so let's just make the same cell phone 
forever.

994
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,660
We're good.
You know,

995
00:40:58,661 --> 00:41:03,010
you have an iphone six s leave it there.
We don't need any more innovation.

996
00:41:03,011 --> 00:41:03,844
Let's use that for,
for other things mean we'd probably be 

997
00:41:06,101 --> 00:41:07,840
pretty happy.
We'd be all right.

998
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,420
But you know,
that's not how companies working now,

999
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,470
but we're fascinated by innovation.
We actually,

1000
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,180
I'm a little mad at apple right now 
because the new o s system,

1001
00:41:16,181 --> 00:41:18,490
I lost half my music.
I don't know where it went and I haven't

1002
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,950
taken the time to figure out how to get 
it back.

1003
00:41:20,951 --> 00:41:21,641
And what do you mean?
Oh,

1004
00:41:21,641 --> 00:41:23,750
it's not on your phone and the cloud he 
has.

1005
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,720
They're encouraging use of the cloud.
Yeah,

1006
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,930
yeah.
You could say guys,

1007
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,540
whatever.
It was great.

1008
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:34,040
Just okay,
but that that mean there

1009
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,620
is a lot of nonsense that they do when 
they update things,

1010
00:41:36,621 --> 00:41:37,454
but that's also because they're trying 
to build in new features and their 

1011
00:41:39,591 --> 00:41:41,720
planning several steps ahead for the 
future.

1012
00:41:41,721 --> 00:41:44,960
They want everything to be in the cloud,
which is kind of weird.

1013
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:46,010
Another thing,
electric cars,

1014
00:41:46,011 --> 00:41:51,011
I think you go to the Petersen Museum 
here and you see electric cars in the 19

1015
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:56,210
twenties happened,
conspiracy kind of oil companies,

1016
00:41:56,211 --> 00:41:57,044
tire company.
You ever see the documentary who killed 

1017
00:41:58,491 --> 00:41:59,750
the electric car?
Absolutely.

1018
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:00,650
Yeah.
It's like we should have.

1019
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,513
We should be there now.
You should have been there decades ago 

1020
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,630
then about the fact that Henry Ford's 
first car,

1021
00:42:05,631 --> 00:42:08,800
the fenders were made out of hemp and 
you know that.

1022
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:10,340
I've never seen it.
No.

1023
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:11,174
I'll show you a video of them because 
it's really fascinating and pull up 

1024
00:42:13,761 --> 00:42:18,761
Henry Ford first car hamp.
They used hemp fibers too,

1025
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,413
by the way,
was legal back then know it wasn't 

1026
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:25,550
illegal until they came up with a thing 
called the decorticator,

1027
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:28,730
which will allow them to effectively 
process hemp fiber.

1028
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:32,540
That's when William Randolph hearst 
started this propaganda against hemp.

1029
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,590
That was era.
Yeah.

1030
00:42:33,591 --> 00:42:36,830
That's how marijuana became illegal.
It had nothing to do with the drug.

1031
00:42:36,831 --> 00:42:37,664
The psychoactive aspect of it had to do 
with the the textiles and using it as 

1032
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:45,680
paper and using it as a commodity.
That's when it became illegal and it was

1033
00:42:45,681 --> 00:42:46,514
all hearst.
William Randolph hearst was a 

1034
00:42:47,571 --> 00:42:48,680
motherfucker.
Really?

1035
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,543
Yeah.
So this car is actually made out of 

1036
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,584
hemp.
The fenders and Lotus did one recently 

1037
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:57,770
where they had an exposed hood.
But what's interesting about this,

1038
00:42:57,771 --> 00:43:00,470
we see it a Henry Ford,
I don't know if it's this video,

1039
00:43:00,471 --> 00:43:02,090
but he hit it.
He hit him with a hammer.

1040
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:04,310
Oh Wow.
I mean incredibly durable.

1041
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,070
Hemp is an amazing,
amazing plant.

1042
00:43:07,071 --> 00:43:09,290
I don't know if you've ever picked up a 
hemp stock,

1043
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:13,760
but it's incredibly hard,
but really light,

1044
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,833
like very,
very different than any other would 

1045
00:43:15,981 --> 00:43:16,130
like.

1046
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,960
It's hard like a walnut.
Right?

1047
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:20,270
But it's light like a Balsa Wood.
It's very,

1048
00:43:20,271 --> 00:43:22,310
very strange.
It's a very unusual car.

1049
00:43:22,311 --> 00:43:24,140
Pull up the Lotus because it was real 
recent,

1050
00:43:24,141 --> 00:43:27,380
like last year to my car.
Exactly.

1051
00:43:27,381 --> 00:43:31,580
It would bend like crazy.
It's lighter and stronger than steel,

1052
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:32,780
which is insane.
Right.

1053
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:35,330
And you know,
the whole thing with how to drugs become

1054
00:43:35,331 --> 00:43:36,640
illegal.
That's a kind of a concern,

1055
00:43:36,641 --> 00:43:37,474
you know,
sort of a conspiracy is a real 

1056
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,480
conspiracy because hemp is non 
psychoactive.

1057
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:45,350
The fact that it's still illegal.
I mean they're just now starting to grow

1058
00:43:45,351 --> 00:43:46,184
it in America.
We sell him my company on it sells hemp 

1059
00:43:49,311 --> 00:43:50,810
protein,
which is legal.

1060
00:43:50,811 --> 00:43:52,910
Non-Psychoactive doesn't have any thc in
it.

1061
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,850
We had a buyer from Canada.
Really see this right here.

1062
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:57,510
This is the new,
um,

1063
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,453
Lotus that is the entire roof if they 
show it and see if you could find a 

1064
00:44:02,211 --> 00:44:04,310
picture where they show the actual car 
itself,

1065
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:05,620
Jamie,
but it's a,

1066
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:06,463
these,
all these panels are made out of hemp 

1067
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:10,970
and like it's insanely light.

1068
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:13,310
Yeah.
But if you show the actual car itself,

1069
00:44:13,311 --> 00:44:15,560
Jamie,
you can see maybe go to the front,

1070
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:18,230
the,
the beginning of the video.

1071
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:20,480
You could see the actual hood of the 
car.

1072
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,690
It's exposed.
Okay.

1073
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:25,880
So they may,
they essentially made a giant percentage

1074
00:44:25,881 --> 00:44:29,250
of the car out of hemp,
including the seats that looks,

1075
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:31,620
that looks lighter than carbon fibers.
Hey,

1076
00:44:31,621 --> 00:44:33,570
I wonder if anyone's made a hemp 
bicycle.

1077
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:35,370
That's a good question because that,
you know,

1078
00:44:35,371 --> 00:44:36,780
that's the whole thing about carbon 
fibers.

1079
00:44:36,781 --> 00:44:37,614
So lightweight but strong.
So if what you were saying about him is 

1080
00:44:39,541 --> 00:44:40,374
true,
there should be heavy bikes on a lot of 

1081
00:44:41,671 --> 00:44:44,820
other light things like bows and things 
along those lines.

1082
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:45,960
I think that,
uh,

1083
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:48,480
that's a real conspiracy conspiracy 
back,

1084
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:49,740
Wayne.
There's a reason why,

1085
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,753
you know,
Orson Welles made that movie citizen 

1086
00:44:52,711 --> 00:44:55,920
Kane Bout William Randolph hearst and 
insanely,

1087
00:44:55,921 --> 00:44:56,754
insanely powerful and influential man 
who didn't really use that influence in 

1088
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:01,350
the best way for society.

1089
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,213
Did it Tuesday he had paper mills and he
didn't want to convert his paper into 

1090
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,833
hemp paper and paper was far superior,
but it would have cost them millions of 

1091
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:10,403
dollars because he had forests and so 
popular science magazine back then and 

1092
00:45:14,491 --> 00:45:16,920
see if he could find this color.
It was a hemp,

1093
00:45:16,921 --> 00:45:20,130
the new billion dollar crop.
A bicycle from him.

1094
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:21,900
There you go.
Done.

1095
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:24,060
Yeah,
that's a good looking bike.

1096
00:45:24,061 --> 00:45:24,870
Okay.
Yeah,

1097
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:26,640
there you go.
I have a carbon fiber bike.

1098
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:28,110
Maybe I'll have to start looking at 
that.

1099
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:30,120
Yeah,
I don't know where you buy one of those.

1100
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:32,870
Um,
why is there no thc in the hip,

1101
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,610
in the,
a female plants in the,

1102
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,820
in the flower.
Okay.

1103
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,673
It's in the flower buds.
That's the female is the one you get 

1104
00:45:42,061 --> 00:45:43,780
high off of the mail,
but your,

1105
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:47,490
which one is the stock of it?
You're not looking for flowers,

1106
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:50,710
so when you're using it to make things 
right,

1107
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,740
but uh,
the seeds but hemp,

1108
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,230
it's on the cover of the,
uh,

1109
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,213
of popular science from like way back 
then it looks like about 19 thirties or 

1110
00:46:00,181 --> 00:46:00,510
forties.

1111
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:01,920
Yeah,
well I believe it was,

1112
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,220
I want to say 30.
It was 33 or something like that,

1113
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,730
or 35 when it was made illegal.
And uh,

1114
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,940
they made it illegal and they were 
calling it marijuana,

1115
00:46:11,941 --> 00:46:12,774
which is really interesting.
Which is a slang for a Mexican wild 

1116
00:46:15,181 --> 00:46:17,700
tobacco.
It's not even cannabis.

1117
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:20,310
So when they were making marijuana 
illegal,

1118
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:22,320
they didn't even know that they were 
making hemp illegal.

1119
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,640
It was very tricky the way they did it.
They,

1120
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:25,703
they made these articles,
they printed all these articles about 

1121
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:32,640
Mexicans and blacks raping white women 
because they were high on this new drug.

1122
00:46:32,641 --> 00:46:34,800
Right.
That's also what funded reefer madness,

1123
00:46:34,801 --> 00:46:38,500
which I'm sure you've seen it all those.
Those are real conspiracies.

1124
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:39,363
Absolutely.
And that's people that had a vested 

1125
00:46:41,641 --> 00:46:44,130
financial interest in making something 
illegal,

1126
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,113
a commodity.
It's so crazy because the fact that 

1127
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:51,120
marijuana or the cannabis plant is so 
versatile,

1128
00:46:51,121 --> 00:46:52,320
it,
there's so many different things.

1129
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:53,453
They figured out a way to attack one 
aspect of it and demonize the entire 

1130
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:57,564
plant and then eliminate competition 
right now because it makes a far 

1131
00:47:00,841 --> 00:47:02,850
superior paper,
far superior cloth.

1132
00:47:02,851 --> 00:47:04,860
It's like incredibly durable.
Like the paper,

1133
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:07,110
if you ever had hemp paper in front of 
you,

1134
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,200
it feels like a regular piece of paper,
but it's really hard to tear.

1135
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,720
It's a really interesting job.
Money out of that.

1136
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:13,680
Exactly.
Well,

1137
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,480
what do they make money out of now?
Well,

1138
00:47:15,481 --> 00:47:17,110
it's in fiber.
Yeah.

1139
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:18,580
Yeah.
So,

1140
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:19,350
well,
and there's,

1141
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:21,530
there was a documentary on about the,
uh,

1142
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:25,200
public transportation system here in La 
that was quite extensive at the thirties

1143
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:26,640
with the,
you know,

1144
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:29,980
electric,
electric trolleys and this stuff and

1145
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,070
they all got ripped out and torn down 
and the cars were burned and so on,

1146
00:47:33,071 --> 00:47:36,970
just because the automobile industry and
the oil industry wanted it,

1147
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,400
you know,
it's like La should be a car down entire

1148
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:40,234
country,
should be a car culture rather than a 

1149
00:47:42,011 --> 00:47:44,650
public transportation culture.
My wife's from Cologne,

1150
00:47:44,651 --> 00:47:45,484
Germany,
public transportation in Europe is 

1151
00:47:47,081 --> 00:47:47,914
fantastic.
You really don't need a car for except 

1152
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:52,660
for rare occasions here when she moved 
here to be with me.

1153
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:53,494
It's like,
oh,

1154
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,180
got to have a car.
He can't get anywhere.

1155
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:57,850
And uh,
again,

1156
00:47:57,851 --> 00:47:58,684
that's kind of a conspiracy and that's,
those are the kinds of things we should 

1157
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:02,980
be focusing on.
And talking about.

1158
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,560
Uh,
I think the war on drugs,

1159
00:48:05,561 --> 00:48:07,270
I mean,
I don't call it a conspiracy,

1160
00:48:07,271 --> 00:48:08,380
but you know,
it's over.

1161
00:48:08,381 --> 00:48:10,010
It's been over for decades.

1162
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:10,893
That's,
it's also so blatant that it's only the 

1163
00:48:13,241 --> 00:48:14,910
war on some drugs.
Yes.

1164
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,990
It's not like we're trying to keep 
everyone's sober,

1165
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:21,190
we're just gonna sell sanctioned drugs 
that have tax codes,

1166
00:48:21,191 --> 00:48:22,024
you know,
and that's,

1167
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:23,083
that's really what the war is on drugs 
that you can't control and tax and it's 

1168
00:48:26,711 --> 00:48:28,740
so blatant and obvious,
right?

1169
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:32,350
It might not treat it like an industry,
like any alcohol industry.

1170
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:33,580
Sure,
absolutely.

1171
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:34,880
Yep.
Like alcohol,

1172
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:36,003
alcohol's,
and unbelievably devastating drug and 

1173
00:48:37,601 --> 00:48:38,434
readily available almost everywhere.
We've got enough in that back room to 

1174
00:48:40,511 --> 00:48:42,070
kill you.
If you want to kill yourself.

1175
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:45,010
Drink right now while the show was going
on.

1176
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:47,200
We went in the next hour,
you'll be dead.

1177
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,000
It'll be amazing.
Yeah.

1178
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,910
That's amazing.
And mentally and no one cares.

1179
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:52,960
Like everybody would go,
wow.

1180
00:48:52,961 --> 00:48:54,640
Michael Shermer drank himself to death.
Oh,

1181
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:56,400
poor guy.
You know what I mean?

1182
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:57,510
It's not like,
Oh man,

1183
00:48:57,511 --> 00:48:59,200
he did drugs and he had an old.

1184
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:00,610
Wow,
that's so tragic.

1185
00:49:00,611 --> 00:49:02,010
Drugs are awful,
right?

1186
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:04,540
While they're everywhere,
every street you go down,

1187
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:05,463
you pass by liquor stores and 
restaurants that sell just molecules in 

1188
00:49:08,891 --> 00:49:10,960
your brain and your body.
Uh,

1189
00:49:10,961 --> 00:49:12,550
so what's the difference?
Well,

1190
00:49:12,551 --> 00:49:13,384
there's an,
there's absolutely real legitimate 

1191
00:49:15,941 --> 00:49:19,570
conspiracies and I do agree with you 
that those are the ones to focus on,

1192
00:49:19,571 --> 00:49:23,970
but they're not sexy,
sexy ones or Ufo or bigfoot.

1193
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,060
Yeah,
that kind of stuff.

1194
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,500
Yep.
Global diamond.

1195
00:49:26,501 --> 00:49:27,334
Yes.
I did this show for the Scifi channel 

1196
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,550
called Joe Rogan questions.
Everything around her that.

1197
00:49:33,551 --> 00:49:34,280
Yes.
Yeah.

1198
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:37,840
I went around and I talked to experts,
believers,

1199
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:39,760
nonbelievers,
scientists,

1200
00:49:39,761 --> 00:49:43,450
all these different people about a bunch
of different subjects and boy,

1201
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:44,373
my desire to do that show before I 
started doing it was very high and my 

1202
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:49,444
desire to completely avoid any,
any of that nonsense towards the end of 

1203
00:49:52,331 --> 00:49:53,164
the show was it was almost like I 
couldn't do it anymore because I had 

1204
00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:00,400
already recognized what was going on in 
so many of these cases that I was like,

1205
00:50:00,401 --> 00:50:01,234
this is just a bunch of people that want
to believe they have these ideas in 

1206
00:50:05,591 --> 00:50:07,450
their head and they want to chase these 
ideas down,

1207
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:11,530
whether it's big foot or whether it's 
UFO and they're not being objective even

1208
00:50:11,531 --> 00:50:12,364
remotely.

1209
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,273
The vast majority of the people that are
a part of the movement or the community 

1210
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:18,083
that like researches,
ghosts or research is bigfoot or 

1211
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:21,970
researchers.
Nice people.

1212
00:50:21,971 --> 00:50:22,804
They're not that,
but the way they're looking at it right 

1213
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,040
is the same.
It's the same whether it's bigfoot

1214
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,490
or chem trails or Ufo or they.
They're not.

1215
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,990
They're not being objective.
They're going,

1216
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:33,920
well,
maybe this.

1217
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:35,900
What about that?
We'll have we considered this?

1218
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,130
Nope.
They're just going.

1219
00:50:37,131 --> 00:50:37,964
We know the evidence is out there.
The government has been hiding extra 

1220
00:50:40,191 --> 00:50:42,580
terrestrial life in this country.
Like where,

1221
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,520
where,
where's the government?

1222
00:50:43,521 --> 00:50:44,930
Where's,
where's the government doing this?

1223
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,033
Where's the evidence?
We know from surveys that if you tick 

1224
00:50:47,361 --> 00:50:49,400
the box that you believe in aliens or 
whatever,

1225
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,090
you'll tick all the boxes.
Psychics.

1226
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,420
Exactly the whole thing.
Yeah.

1227
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:57,530
So there's a certain personality that 
gravitates toward those kinds of beliefs

1228
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:59,480
and then,
and then buys the whole thing.

1229
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:01,820
Even when their contract,
they contradict each other,

1230
00:51:01,821 --> 00:51:03,470
like people that were,
uh,

1231
00:51:03,471 --> 00:51:05,330
that believed that Princess di was 
murdered.

1232
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:06,223
Also are morally inclined to say she 
faked her death and is still alive 

1233
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:10,640
somewhere.
She was hanging out with Tupac.

1234
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,740
Yeah,
they can't both be true,

1235
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,470
but again,
there's,

1236
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:15,303
so with this,
there's some cognitive dissonance that 

1237
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:20,210
we want a balance between the size of 
the event and the size of the cars.

1238
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:21,044
So I think,
uh,

1239
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:22,040
you know,
the Holocaust,

1240
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:24,200
one of the worst thing that's ever 
happened,

1241
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:28,340
whereas genocide ever conducted by one 
of the worst regime,

1242
00:51:28,341 --> 00:51:31,130
political regimes in human history,
so there's kind of a balance there,

1243
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:32,960
but if you haven't like jfk,
you know,

1244
00:51:32,961 --> 00:51:34,830
the leader of the free world,
you know,

1245
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:36,200
powerful,
articulate,

1246
00:51:36,201 --> 00:51:37,040
handsome,
and so on.

1247
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:40,040
And he's brought down by who,
Lee Harvey Oswald,

1248
00:51:40,041 --> 00:51:41,480
some lone nut,
this loser,

1249
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:42,373
you know,
there's a.

1250
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,480
So you've got a pile on the,
you know,

1251
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:45,363
the,
the mafia and the CIA and he wold acted 

1252
00:51:47,931 --> 00:51:48,351
alone.
Yeah,

1253
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,340
I do.
Absolutely.

1254
00:51:49,341 --> 00:51:50,250
Absolutely.
No question.

1255
00:51:50,251 --> 00:51:51,830
Why do you think that?
Well,

1256
00:51:51,831 --> 00:51:53,840
first of all,
there's a ton of evidence that he did do

1257
00:51:53,841 --> 00:51:53,960
it.

1258
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,680
And most of the JFK conspiracy people 
also agree he was involved.

1259
00:51:57,681 --> 00:51:59,180
He,
that he was one of the shooters.

1260
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,820
It's one that they think there's more 
than one shooter,

1261
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,220
but so we have lots of evidence that he 
did it.

1262
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:05,210
You know,
we have his rifle,

1263
00:52:05,211 --> 00:52:07,640
we have the paper trail of what he 
bought the rifle.

1264
00:52:07,641 --> 00:52:08,474
His fingerprints are on the rifle that 
was found in the fingerprints found 

1265
00:52:13,401 --> 00:52:18,401
several days after they found that they 
had it right away too.

1266
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,180
Is a lot of stuff with that.
So when you go to appearance,

1267
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,940
he though that's really slippery.
Well,

1268
00:52:22,941 --> 00:52:23,774
okay,
so here's one of the things that 

1269
00:52:24,081 --> 00:52:24,914
happens.
The moment something takes on great 

1270
00:52:25,971 --> 00:52:29,510
significance.
Our mind focuses on little anomalies.

1271
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:32,930
Like why was there that guy in Dealey 
Plaza with the umbrella?

1272
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,190
It's a sunny day.
It's not going to rain set.

1273
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,060
Okay.
So he was out there protesting,

1274
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:39,343
you know,
decades later they've tracked this guy 

1275
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:40,850
down.

1276
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:43,730
He was called the umbrella man.
It's like the cigarette smoking man on x

1277
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:44,200
files,
like,

1278
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,033
Ooh,
who is the umbrella man and that the 

1279
00:52:46,281 --> 00:52:48,050
umbrella must have been a gun and so 
forth.

1280
00:52:48,051 --> 00:52:49,060
And he said,
no,

1281
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:53,090
this is a leftover from world war 
chamberlain and in his umbrella.

1282
00:52:53,091 --> 00:52:55,960
And he sold out to Hitler.
And that,

1283
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:58,670
so the umbrella became a protest against
government,

1284
00:52:58,820 --> 00:52:59,653
whatever,
and so he was protesting Kennedy with 

1285
00:53:01,191 --> 00:53:03,290
his umbrella.
And uh,

1286
00:53:03,291 --> 00:53:05,270
so that's.
So that's a typical thing.

1287
00:53:05,271 --> 00:53:07,370
Who Cares if somebody has an umbrella on
a sunny day,

1288
00:53:07,371 --> 00:53:08,780
whatever.
It seems like a silly thing,

1289
00:53:08,781 --> 00:53:11,510
but the moment something big happens.
Okay.

1290
00:53:11,511 --> 00:53:12,344
What is the meaning of that?
I've never even heard of that umbrella 

1291
00:53:13,971 --> 00:53:15,260
guy,
but I have researched.

1292
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:18,150
Did you ever read David Lifton's book of
Yes to evidence?

1293
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:19,510
Yeah.
That's pretty fascinating.

1294
00:53:19,511 --> 00:53:20,210
Yeah.
But,

1295
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:23,450
but Vincent Bugliosi,
he dressed all of those claims is last.

1296
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:27,150
One of his last books was a case closed 
now.

1297
00:53:27,151 --> 00:53:32,151
That was Gerald Posner,
also a good book whose book it was,

1298
00:53:32,701 --> 00:53:34,950
like a restoring history or something 
like that.

1299
00:53:34,951 --> 00:53:38,250
It's big massive thing.
He did a shorter version and uh,

1300
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,020
but he lined up all those claims,
you know,

1301
00:53:40,021 --> 00:53:40,854
like one of them was that I had it as 
well get a job at the book depository 

1302
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:44,874
building that was right on the parade 
route and he's going to turn right in 

1303
00:53:47,191 --> 00:53:48,090
front of it.
There's Kennedy.

1304
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,690
He must have known he was planted there 
by operatives that knew this was going.

1305
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:52,980
No.
So,

1306
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:53,903
uh,
I think it was posner who track track 

1307
00:53:54,871 --> 00:53:55,704
down when the White House determined 
that Kennedy was even going to go to 

1308
00:53:59,071 --> 00:54:02,370
Dallas and then months later the parade 
route is determined.

1309
00:54:02,371 --> 00:54:02,820
Just,
you know,

1310
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:03,653
just before we went.
And Oswald had that job there months 

1311
00:54:06,001 --> 00:54:07,860
before.
It was just pure chance.

1312
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:11,550
Randomness.
So much of human history turns on random

1313
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:12,384
events.
It's like the assassination of Franz 

1314
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:15,480
Ferdinand had triggered the first world 
war.

1315
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:19,260
This was a conspiracy.
There were seven operatives of the black

1316
00:54:19,261 --> 00:54:20,094
hand,
which was this Serbian nationalist 

1317
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:22,583
organization and they wanted to 
assassinate the archduke Franz 

1318
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:26,671
Ferdinand.
Okay.

1319
00:54:26,671 --> 00:54:28,260
So,
and we know what the,

1320
00:54:28,261 --> 00:54:29,094
you know,
they went to this house to get the 

1321
00:54:29,671 --> 00:54:32,000
weapon and that has to get the grenade 
and the rifle and they,

1322
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,390
you,
you stand on this corner,

1323
00:54:33,391 --> 00:54:35,880
I'm going to be over there.
And this is typically how it goes.

1324
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,740
A couple of them,
chicken that somebody did,

1325
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:38,910
that,
they went to the house,

1326
00:54:38,911 --> 00:54:41,400
the person wasn't there to give them 
their weapon,

1327
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:43,013
cause there's like three of them left 
and then one of them through the hand 

1328
00:54:45,061 --> 00:54:45,894
grenade,
it bounced off the car and went under 

1329
00:54:46,861 --> 00:54:50,790
another car and damage that car,
but not the car.

1330
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:53,480
And then to the whole thing was bungled 
and,

1331
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:57,960
and off he went and uh,
and he gave a speech and then he decided

1332
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:58,794
to go back to the hospital to visit the 
people that were hurt and that and the 

1333
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,993
trailing car.
And they took the parade route back 

1334
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,790
backwards on the course.
And there's this guy,

1335
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:11,260
prince eps sitting there on the curb,
despondent like,

1336
00:55:11,261 --> 00:55:13,930
well that was a screw up and here comes 
the archduke ban.

1337
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:16,010
What was a little more complicated than 
that?

1338
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:16,873
In fact,
the car stalled out because the cars 

1339
00:55:19,621 --> 00:55:21,930
back then were really bad at going in 
reverse.

1340
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:22,823
Right?
So he was trying to put the car in 

1341
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:24,624
reverse.
The driver of the car is putting it in 

1342
00:55:25,471 --> 00:55:26,430
reverse.
It was convertible,

1343
00:55:26,431 --> 00:55:27,120
right?
Yup.

1344
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,190
He's putting it in reverse.
The car stalled out.

1345
00:55:29,191 --> 00:55:30,024
And at that moment,
a guy was coming out of a store or a 

1346
00:55:31,801 --> 00:55:32,634
restaurant where he had a sandwich 
because they had something to eat after 

1347
00:55:34,951 --> 00:55:36,750
it was over,
literally walked out.

1348
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:39,450
He was right there and shot him and shot
his wife.

1349
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:43,860
So that's typically conspiracies that 
definitely can happen.

1350
00:55:43,861 --> 00:55:48,330
And obviously if Oswald had that job,
you know long in advance,

1351
00:55:48,331 --> 00:55:50,430
it shows before they have planned that 
out.

1352
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:51,264
It showed that there's a lot of 
randomness involved at Lincoln 

1353
00:55:53,251 --> 00:55:55,320
assassination.
That was a conspiracy.

1354
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:57,320
They were going to assassinate the vice 
president,

1355
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:58,560
president,
vice president,

1356
00:55:58,561 --> 00:56:00,330
secretary of state,
secretary of war,

1357
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:04,030
and they had all the guys going to do 
this and they all screwed up in.

1358
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:04,963
The only one that succeeded was booth.
But we knew that there was a conspiracy 

1359
00:56:08,941 --> 00:56:09,774
within hours.
And then within days they got the whole 

1360
00:56:10,891 --> 00:56:11,724
thing.
Where are the people that did this to 

1361
00:56:12,871 --> 00:56:15,600
Kennedy or nine slash 11.
Who were the other operatives?

1362
00:56:15,601 --> 00:56:16,560
Who is it?
Who did it?

1363
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,190
Well,
wasn't there a some deathbed confessions

1364
00:56:20,191 --> 00:56:21,750
from.
What was his name hunt.

1365
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:24,130
Was that the.
That

1366
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:27,820
guy that they have photos of him that he
was arrested at the scene of the crime.

1367
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,010
You remember the Hobos that were 
arrested,

1368
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:30,844
that were behind the grassy knoll and 
there was so many people that called 

1369
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,380
that said that they had heard shots from
the grassy knoll.

1370
00:56:35,381 --> 00:56:38,680
There's more than one that's possible 
because there was an echoing effect.

1371
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,970
If you go to Dealey Plaza,
it's surprisingly small and our magic.

1372
00:56:42,971 --> 00:56:44,170
It's weird when you see.
Yeah,

1373
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:47,180
and you know there's a museum now on the
sixth floor of the book.

1374
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,260
You can look right out the window and 
you can see the x on the street.

1375
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:51,620
First shot,
second shot,

1376
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:53,830
Howard Hunt,
Howard.

1377
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:55,023
Confessions of Howard Hunt know that he 
had said that on his deathbed he was a 

1378
00:56:59,441 --> 00:57:02,360
CIA spy,
and on his deathbed he obviously can fit

1379
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,333
convicted Watergate conspirators.
And he said that he was involved in the 

1380
00:57:06,941 --> 00:57:07,774
assassination.

1381
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:12,880
He said that on his deathbed he talked 
about how he's an active participant.

1382
00:57:12,881 --> 00:57:13,541
Yes.
Okay.

1383
00:57:13,541 --> 00:57:14,680
Well then,
I don't know,

1384
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:17,650
I don't know this particular one,
but why would you.

1385
00:57:17,651 --> 00:57:18,484
Why would you like be so quick to think 
that more people weren't involved until 

1386
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:23,350
I was open to the possibility.
I mean,

1387
00:57:23,351 --> 00:57:24,950
we did this issue of skeptic,
you know,

1388
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:27,300
on the 50 years later,
um,

1389
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,760
what,
what clothes were closed?

1390
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:30,070
It was that bookcase closed.
Uh,

1391
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:31,750
and then just one book.
Well,

1392
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:34,960
and then Boleo sees book.
I started reading,

1393
00:57:34,961 --> 00:57:36,040
you know,
just here's the claim,

1394
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:37,960
here's the explanation here.
Hundreds of things.

1395
00:57:37,961 --> 00:57:39,870
Did they cover hunt?
I don't,

1396
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,260
I don't remember it probably.
Did they,

1397
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:42,243
how do they cover the fact that the 
magic bullet theory was concocted 

1398
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:49,600
because they had to account for a bullet
that hit a curb under the overpass.

1399
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:50,493
You know that,
right?

1400
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,281
Yeah.
But you know,

1401
00:57:51,281 --> 00:57:56,050
Nova did a whole two hour special on the
magic bullet and you know,

1402
00:57:56,051 --> 00:57:57,460
the seats are not lined up.
They're like this.

1403
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:00,040
It didn't have to make a right turn,
left turn kind of thing.

1404
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:00,730
Yeah.
That's.

1405
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:01,331
I mean,
look,

1406
00:58:01,331 --> 00:58:02,164
I've,
I hunt and I shoot guns and bullets do 

1407
00:58:04,571 --> 00:58:06,310
weird things.
When they hit things,

1408
00:58:06,311 --> 00:58:08,650
they ricochet off stuff and they go left
and they go,

1409
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:09,910
right?
They go all over the place.

1410
00:58:09,911 --> 00:58:10,744
It's you,
the idea that you are going to act to 

1411
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:13,593
accurately determine when someone shoots
someone and hits bone where that 

1412
00:58:16,811 --> 00:58:19,960
bullet's going to go next is crazy.
They do weird things,

1413
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:20,410
right.
You know,

1414
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:23,470
they come out of people's heads.
Sometimes you shoot someone in the front

1415
00:58:23,471 --> 00:58:24,820
and it had come out the top of their 
head.

1416
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:26,220
It doesn't make any sense.
Right?

1417
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:27,223
Um,
but what doesn't make sense more than 

1418
00:58:30,011 --> 00:58:33,730
that is the pristine condition of that 
bullet after shattering bone.

1419
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,190
Well,
it wasn't a pristine.

1420
00:58:35,191 --> 00:58:40,191
It was squished and compared to a bullet
that's hit bone,

1421
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:41,453
there's like they've shot,
I'm pretty sure it was another one 

1422
00:58:43,121 --> 00:58:47,500
that's shot through the jail.
And then also your shot through Joe Shit

1423
00:58:47,501 --> 00:58:48,970
shot bone.
It was shattered.

1424
00:58:48,971 --> 00:58:49,804
They've never been able to recreate the 
get a bullet to look like that after it 

1425
00:58:52,631 --> 00:58:53,800
shattered bone.
Never.

1426
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:57,610
When the bullet hit connelly,
it broke more than one bone in his body.

1427
00:58:57,630 --> 00:58:59,080
Broke three different bones,
I believe,

1428
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:02,650
and dislodged or broke his wrist.
Like there's the bullet.

1429
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:04,820
Look at it.
That's not bad.

1430
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:06,160
Yeah.
When you look at it,

1431
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:07,250
it,
it's,

1432
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:09,340
it's bulging.
We have a picture of it here,

1433
00:59:09,341 --> 00:59:10,890
by the way.
There it is.

1434
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:11,800
Yeah,
so it,

1435
00:59:11,801 --> 00:59:14,800
it is compressed,
but if you shoot a bullet in the water,

1436
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,960
it looks like that.
Have you ever shot a bullet into water?

1437
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,040
Uh,
no.

1438
00:59:18,041 --> 00:59:18,880
I haven't done.
They don't.

1439
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:21,530
They don't look when the bullet is 
coming out and it's,

1440
00:59:21,531 --> 00:59:22,300
you know,
there's

1441
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:22,780
the,
the,

1442
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:25,340
the gunpowder goes off and it's flying 
out.

1443
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:26,623
You're going to have some distortion and
when a bullet shoots into a pillow or a 

1444
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:31,083
shoots into anything,
you're going to have some distortion 

1445
00:59:32,571 --> 00:59:33,404
because of that.
Just sheer force and velocity of that 

1446
00:59:36,021 --> 00:59:38,240
bullet.
But when you shatter bone,

1447
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:42,050
when they all get bent up and distorted,
they don't get like that.

1448
00:59:42,051 --> 00:59:45,020
That's not something that hit anything 
in my opinion.

1449
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:47,330
I think that if that.
Not only that,

1450
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,193
the way they found it on the Gurney,
on Connolly's Gurney when he was in the 

1451
00:59:51,381 --> 00:59:52,460
hospital.
Oh look,

1452
00:59:52,461 --> 00:59:53,900
we found the bullet.
Here it is.

1453
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,780
It's ridiculous.
That smacks of conspiracy,

1454
00:59:56,781 --> 00:59:57,614
that billet bullet more than anything.
I'm not saying that I know what 

1455
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:02,150
happened,
but I know that the reason why they came

1456
01:00:02,151 --> 01:00:05,000
up with the fact that one bullet did the
damage,

1457
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:05,983
not just in Kennedy but also in 
uncommonly was because they had an 

1458
01:00:08,091 --> 01:00:08,924
account for that bullet that hit the 
underpass and hit the underpass that 

1459
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:14,060
ricocheted hit some guy and that guy 
went to the hospital.

1460
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:17,480
They found the bullet hole in the 
granite of the,

1461
01:00:17,481 --> 01:00:18,020
uh,
the,

1462
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:19,010
the uh,
curb stone.

1463
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:21,590
So they had to account for that.
And that's why they came up with.

1464
01:00:21,591 --> 01:00:25,310
It also was Arlen Specter was one of the
guys who came up with that theory.

1465
01:00:25,311 --> 01:00:29,450
It was a notorious scumbag.
He was on the Watergate Commissioner,

1466
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:30,490
you know?
Right.

1467
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:33,320
It's not a funkiness is what I'm saying 
and I'm not,

1468
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:37,250
but I have been in the past inclined to 
gravitate towards some pretty ridiculous

1469
01:00:37,251 --> 01:00:38,084
conspiracies.
But that bullet is anybody that knows 

1470
01:00:40,491 --> 01:00:41,324
anything about hunting or guns or any,
any person that I know that I've talked 

1471
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:45,890
to,
like what do you,

1472
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:48,350
is this shot anything?
Everyone say's no,

1473
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:49,690
everyone says that it hasn't hit.

1474
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:54,710
But one thing to remember is that in all
investigations are fields of inquiry.

1475
01:00:56,550 --> 01:01:01,420
There's always an a residue of 
unexplained anomalies that any theory,

1476
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:02,340
physics,
theory,

1477
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:03,600
evolution,
whatever,

1478
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:04,471
you know,
there's always.

1479
01:01:04,471 --> 01:01:05,304
Yeah,
but how do you explain this one little 

1480
01:01:06,001 --> 01:01:06,834
weird thing here that doesn't really get
accounted for by your explanation over 

1481
01:01:09,691 --> 01:01:11,220
here.
And the answer is,

1482
01:01:11,221 --> 01:01:14,310
I don't know.
No theory explains everything.

1483
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:15,533
But if you have an alternative theory,
you have to explain all this stuff over 

1484
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:18,924
here that the mainstream theory explains
and the anomalies if you want to be 

1485
01:01:22,201 --> 01:01:23,034
taken seriously.
And usually the focus on the anomalies 

1486
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:26,883
is to the exclusion of all the other 
stuff that is nicely explained by the 

1487
01:01:29,701 --> 01:01:31,350
mainstream theory.
So again,

1488
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:33,930
lone assassin explains a lot,
not everything.

1489
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:36,390
So what do you do with the anomalies?
Nothing.

1490
01:01:36,391 --> 01:01:38,490
You don't have to do anything with them.
I mean that is,

1491
01:01:38,491 --> 01:01:39,450
it's okay to say,
okay,

1492
01:01:39,451 --> 01:01:41,760
that's weird.
Let's keep investigating,

1493
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:43,890
but to,
to then make the leap.

1494
01:01:43,891 --> 01:01:45,810
But we know there was a second shooter.
No,

1495
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:47,220
we just know there's anonymous.

1496
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:49,340
We definitely don't know there was a 
second shooter.

1497
01:01:49,341 --> 01:01:51,410
If there's no evidence whatsoever that 
we can say,

1498
01:01:51,411 --> 01:01:52,011
look,
here,

1499
01:01:52,011 --> 01:01:53,840
we know for a fact there was a second 
shooter.

1500
01:01:53,841 --> 01:01:54,920
We don't,
there's nothing.

1501
01:01:54,921 --> 01:01:55,754
Right?
But we also don't know that one bullet 

1502
01:01:57,921 --> 01:01:58,754
did all that damage and the only reason 
why we believe that one bullet did all 

1503
01:02:00,981 --> 01:02:01,814
that damage is because that was what was
presented and that they had this one 

1504
01:02:05,211 --> 01:02:06,044
boat.
They said that they found in Connolly's 

1505
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:11,990
Gurney that caused all this damage.
That seems rather unlikely.

1506
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:14,330
Very,
very unlikely.

1507
01:02:14,331 --> 01:02:14,800
In fact,

1508
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,510
the other thing we,
uh,

1509
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:17,450
let's see,
we had the,

1510
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,040
the number of people that heard shots,

1511
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:20,963
four shots.
Whenever you say the number of people 

1512
01:02:23,341 --> 01:02:24,330
like,
God,

1513
01:02:24,331 --> 01:02:25,164
man,
I just don't buy eye witness testimony 

1514
01:02:27,001 --> 01:02:29,100
in a murder like that.
It sounds so crazy.

1515
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:29,731
That's good.
Well,

1516
01:02:29,731 --> 01:02:31,410
that's right.
Because it's not reliable.

1517
01:02:31,411 --> 01:02:32,280
Well,
not only that,

1518
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:35,520
there's so much chaos when you're there 
and the president gets shot.

1519
01:02:35,521 --> 01:02:36,354
Bang,
Bang.

1520
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:38,670
Right?
Everybody's adrenaline's flying.

1521
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:40,770
They're running around.
I heard 100 shots.

1522
01:02:40,771 --> 01:02:42,600
You know,
you're going to get outliers.

1523
01:02:42,601 --> 01:02:43,870
You're going to get people that are 
caught.

1524
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:48,120
You're going to get some people that 
have served in the military and are used

1525
01:02:48,121 --> 01:02:52,200
to like chaotic events that can recall 
it clearly and soberly.

1526
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:53,223
Didn't get a few of those,
but good luck sifting through all that 

1527
01:02:55,321 --> 01:02:55,921
shit.
Right?

1528
01:02:55,921 --> 01:02:56,754
Eye witness evidence is.
That's one of the things that drives me 

1529
01:02:58,621 --> 01:02:59,454
crazy.
About nine slash 11 when people are 

1530
01:03:01,291 --> 01:03:02,124
really into the nine slash 11 story.
They say people heard explosions in the 

1531
01:03:04,471 --> 01:03:04,990
buildings.

1532
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:05,823
This guy said that he saw this and he 
saw they don't know what the fuck they 

1533
01:03:08,311 --> 01:03:10,500
saw.
These giant buildings are falling down.

1534
01:03:10,501 --> 01:03:11,930
Everybody's freaking out.
Yup.

1535
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,070
I saw,
I told the story once.

1536
01:03:14,071 --> 01:03:14,904
I saw a squirrel in the woods once and I
thought it was a wolf for like two 

1537
01:03:18,721 --> 01:03:22,260
seconds.
I was in Canada and I said,

1538
01:03:22,261 --> 01:03:23,130
well,
it's fucking squirrel.

1539
01:03:23,131 --> 01:03:24,420
What's wrong with me?
You know,

1540
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:28,260
like I was worried about wolves,
so I thought I saw for like,

1541
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:30,840
I mean I'm gonna look legit,
solid.

1542
01:03:30,841 --> 01:03:33,240
Two seconds I got this fucking squirrel 
was a wolf,

1543
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:34,763
so I don't buy the eyewitness stuff,
but I also don't buy these people that 

1544
01:03:38,341 --> 01:03:41,610
are trying to like neatly like case 
closed.

1545
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,260
Not really.
No,

1546
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:44,303
no.
There's a lot of weird shit with that 

1547
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:46,313
Kennedy assassination thing.
There's also a lot of people that were 

1548
01:03:48,061 --> 01:03:49,190
mad at him because.

1549
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:50,520
Absolutely.
Look,

1550
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:54,420
he closed it as enemies.
He had a lot.

1551
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:55,343
I mean,
Kennedy was a very volatile human being 

1552
01:03:57,961 --> 01:03:59,880
more than Obama today.
Oh yeah.

1553
01:03:59,881 --> 01:04:00,714
I think so.
Actually what Kennedy was trying to do 

1554
01:04:01,741 --> 01:04:03,540
as far as clothes,
the Federal Reserve,

1555
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,870
he wanted to get rid of the CIA.
He wanted to do a lot.

1556
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:10,050
He was opposed to secret service or 
secret societies.

1557
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,433
I mean that,
that massive speech that he did about 

1558
01:04:12,631 --> 01:04:13,464
secret societies.
He was a very fascinating guy and a lot 

1559
01:04:16,291 --> 01:04:17,124
of ways and you know,
flawed in many as well and I'm sure if 

1560
01:04:20,191 --> 01:04:21,024
he was a president today who would be 
involved in probably he be like one of 

1561
01:04:23,761 --> 01:04:25,500
the most scandalous presidents of all 
time,

1562
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:29,160
but I'm not buying this.
I mean,

1563
01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:32,070
I,
I definitely don't think that Lee Harvey

1564
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:32,903
Oswald was an innocent guy.
It seems pretty obvious that he was 

1565
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:35,304
involved in a lot of totally shit and 
remember he had tried to assassinate 

1566
01:04:38,221 --> 01:04:40,870
General Walker just in April before that
and,

1567
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:44,670
and failed and we just don't think that 
he was by himself.

1568
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:47,760
I just don't.
I don't think it just really don't think

1569
01:04:47,761 --> 01:04:49,470
that he was the only one involved in 
that.

1570
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:54,500
It just seems the way a lone assassin 
could operate that that is the likeliest

1571
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,000
scenario.
In a free society,

1572
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:59,430
you can disappear into the nooks and 
crannies,

1573
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:02,010
a big cities and no one will ever notice
you.

1574
01:05:02,011 --> 01:05:02,844
It's like the nine slash 11 up pilots 
that we're training to take off but not 

1575
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,360
ever learned to land.
Why didn't we notice that?

1576
01:05:09,361 --> 01:05:10,140
Well,
you know,

1577
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:12,450
we weren't looking for that.
Too many things going on.

1578
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:13,543
It doesn't mean after the fact.
It's so easy to be an armchair 

1579
01:05:15,301 --> 01:05:16,500
quarterback and go,
you know,

1580
01:05:16,501 --> 01:05:18,070
I'll tell you what they would have known

1581
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:20,880
should have known well after Pearl 
Harbor,

1582
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:22,540
they were conspiracy theories at 
Roosevelt.

1583
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:23,374
Either new,
either orchestrated or knew it would 

1584
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:26,054
happen,
let it happen to squelch the American 

1585
01:05:27,851 --> 01:05:30,650
firsters movement which was imported by 
um,

1586
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:32,090
Lindbergh and,
and,

1587
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:32,973
and he had promised Churchill support,
but he can only do so much the 

1588
01:05:35,901 --> 01:05:39,220
destroyers and all that we need to have.
And then something happens.

1589
01:05:39,221 --> 01:05:40,600
Okay,
so it looks like,

1590
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:42,940
oh,
he must have been involved because he is

1591
01:05:42,941 --> 01:05:45,880
then able to act and get America into 
the Second World War.

1592
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:49,840
But usually politicians act in response 
to something.

1593
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:50,733
Now's my opportunity to take advantage 
of this thing that happened to get my 

1594
01:05:54,491 --> 01:05:56,920
way.
But all politicians do that.

1595
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:01,060
It doesn't mean they're conspiring to 
make the thing happen to get their way.

1596
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:02,920
I don't think the argument was that he 
was conspiring.

1597
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:03,754
The argument was that he knew and then 
pulled out some of the more major 

1598
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,113
warships.

1599
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:09,420
So.
So here's the other attack it.

1600
01:06:09,421 --> 01:06:11,620
It's like the,
the August ninth,

1601
01:06:11,621 --> 01:06:16,621
2001 memo from Condoleezza Rice,
Osama bin Ladin to attack us soil.

1602
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:18,490
Okay.
What about that?

1603
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:21,380
Clearly Bush,
it must have known and you know,

1604
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:22,673
okay,
well what we're forgetting is that the 

1605
01:06:24,370 --> 01:06:27,370
tens of thousands of pieces of Intel 
that come in every day,

1606
01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:29,600
this could happen as good after the 
fact.

1607
01:06:29,630 --> 01:06:30,670
You go back and go,
oh look,

1608
01:06:30,671 --> 01:06:34,090
there's the one we should have known.
Same thing with Pearl Harbor.

1609
01:06:34,091 --> 01:06:35,710
You know Japanese might attack in 
Hawaii.

1610
01:06:35,711 --> 01:06:36,544
Yeah,
but they might attack in the 

1611
01:06:36,761 --> 01:06:38,260
Philippines.
They might attack Alaska,

1612
01:06:38,261 --> 01:06:39,600
they may attack,
you know,

1613
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:40,583
and so on and so on,
which is the right one that we're 

1614
01:06:42,641 --> 01:06:45,910
supposed to then focus our resources on.
You don't know until it happens and then

1615
01:06:45,911 --> 01:06:46,744
you go back and go,
you're fired because you should have 

1616
01:06:48,101 --> 01:06:49,380
acted on that memo.
Well,

1617
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:54,160
but that's why I think you would have to
be an expert in code as well.

1618
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:57,190
You'd have to be an expert and to be 
able to understand what they had,

1619
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,113
what they had intercepted,
would codes it intercepted and what 

1620
01:07:00,161 --> 01:07:03,910
information they actually had back then.
It's again,

1621
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:07,990
one of those things that after the fact 
it's very easy to draw conclusion saying

1622
01:07:07,991 --> 01:07:09,700
this had to be a conspiracy.
I mean,

1623
01:07:09,701 --> 01:07:10,534
I think even the history channel had 
something where they were saying that 

1624
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:15,030
they knew that the attack was going to 
happen,

1625
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:17,470
they let it happen so that they could 
get into world war two.

1626
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:18,580
Right?
That's,

1627
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,950
well,
that was a conspiracy theory at the time

1628
01:07:20,951 --> 01:07:22,840
and there was a congressional 
investigation.

1629
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:26,010
So the equivalent of the Warren report 
about that and concluded no,

1630
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:27,223
that there was no conspiracy on the part
of the US government or any 

1631
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:31,930
administration to,
you know,

1632
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:34,270
that should be held responsible.
I mean,

1633
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,104
a few people I think were fired for not 
having the planes in the right place or 

1634
01:07:37,421 --> 01:07:38,140
something like that.

1635
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:39,530
But uh,
yeah.

1636
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:40,390
But again,
that's just.

1637
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:41,223
And then the other thing we had that 
other psychological effect is that we 

1638
01:07:43,121 --> 01:07:45,190
tend to,
when you're on the outside,

1639
01:07:45,191 --> 01:07:48,400
you tend to see big organizations is 
more powerful than they really are.

1640
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:50,170
Big Corporations,
CEO's,

1641
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:51,303
big government agencies,
and the administrators that run them 

1642
01:07:53,890 --> 01:07:55,120
from the outside,
it looks like.

1643
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,300
I know they have a lot of power and they
can do a lot of things,

1644
01:07:58,301 --> 01:07:59,770
but when you're.
When you get the job,

1645
01:07:59,771 --> 01:08:01,320
then you find out,
oh,

1646
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:02,373
there's a lot of things I can't do,
and here's another one of these 

1647
01:08:05,231 --> 01:08:06,790
conspiracy theories.
That might be true.

1648
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:07,624
When you get elected president,
they take you in the back room and they 

1649
01:08:09,041 --> 01:08:09,610
go,
okay,

1650
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:10,443
here's,
here's what's actually going on and get 

1651
01:08:11,241 --> 01:08:13,030
my.
Here's what's actually going on in Iraq.

1652
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:15,160
No one knows,
but you can't pull the troops.

1653
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:15,980
You can't close the

1654
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:16,813
base.
You can't.

1655
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:17,960
Oh,
well,

1656
01:08:17,961 --> 01:08:19,610
I said I was going to do that yet.
Don't worry about it.

1657
01:08:19,611 --> 01:08:21,320
They all say that,
that you can't do it.

1658
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:22,193
Oh,
all right.

1659
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:23,273
You know,
I think there's a lot of act that goes 

1660
01:08:24,111 --> 01:08:28,100
on that you don't find out that we just 
don't know and we could maybe later.

1661
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:28,963
It's all speculation,
but I think when you're dealing with 

1662
01:08:30,321 --> 01:08:33,350
something like these massive global 
events,

1663
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:34,213
after they occur,
every people are always trying to do 

1664
01:08:35,931 --> 01:08:38,900
some sort of investigative reporting or 
trying to figure it out.

1665
01:08:38,901 --> 01:08:39,734
They're trying to go back over the 
pieces and connect things that make 

1666
01:08:42,121 --> 01:08:46,610
sense and the problem is you get 
confirmation bias on both sides.

1667
01:08:46,611 --> 01:08:47,444
You get confirmation bias where people 
are trying to show very clearly that 

1668
01:08:49,461 --> 01:08:50,294
there was no conspiracy whatsoever and 
then you get people to try and see 

1669
01:08:52,821 --> 01:08:56,180
conspiracy and everything and I think 
with a lot of these stories,

1670
01:08:56,181 --> 01:08:57,014
a lot of these major events like whether
it's jfk assassination or many other 

1671
01:09:00,891 --> 01:09:01,724
ones,
there's a lot of weirdness to them that 

1672
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:07,910
make it real hard to wrap up nice and 
tight and when people can't wrap them up

1673
01:09:07,911 --> 01:09:09,350
nice and tight,
they get very uneasy.

1674
01:09:09,430 --> 01:09:10,340
Yeah,
and it's.

1675
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,050
It's okay to just say,
I don't know.

1676
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:13,880
It could be a conspiracy.
Maybe not.

1677
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:14,880
Let's just.
Yes,

1678
01:09:15,170 --> 01:09:16,180
keep an open mind.
I mean,

1679
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:17,203
you don't have to conspire.
You don't have to construct a whole 

1680
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:22,050
nother world view of operatives and 
agents plots.

1681
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:24,980
You could just say that's a weird thing.
Exactly,

1682
01:09:24,981 --> 01:09:25,814
and I think it's also very important 
that we recognize that there have been 

1683
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:29,564
conspiracies before like nine slash 11 
by itself as a consensus 19 members of 

1684
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:33,453
okay,
I had a bloody and fly planes into 

1685
01:09:33,981 --> 01:09:35,750
buildings.
That's a conveyance inspired.

1686
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:37,340
Yeah.
And that's one.

1687
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:40,730
That's one group that we don't know.
We also know about,

1688
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:41,803
like we said,
the operation northwoods and there's 

1689
01:09:43,671 --> 01:09:46,520
been some false flag events that 
happened in the Gulf of Tonkin.

1690
01:09:46,521 --> 01:09:47,460
That's another one.
There's,

1691
01:09:47,461 --> 01:09:48,294
yeah,
there's been some lies and we know that 

1692
01:09:49,851 --> 01:09:52,400
so it makes the whole thing like really 
weird.

1693
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:53,503
But this is me and these were,
we're talking about actual real events 

1694
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:02,070
as opposed to like psychics and Tarot 
card readers or you know,

1695
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:03,523
my wife's friend went to a fucking 
psychic the other day and I had to 

1696
01:10:05,961 --> 01:10:06,794
listen to this nonsense.
They were talking to me about the 

1697
01:10:08,481 --> 01:10:10,070
psychic thing,
you know,

1698
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:11,143
you know,
we went and she knew everything and she 

1699
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:13,883
was so amazing and she was asking me 
about my aunt and how could she have 

1700
01:10:17,121 --> 01:10:17,901
known like,
Oh,

1701
01:10:17,901 --> 01:10:20,390
fucking Christ first.
I wish I was there,

1702
01:10:20,730 --> 01:10:21,563
I wish I was there to see what kind of 
questions she asked and how you 

1703
01:10:23,481 --> 01:10:24,440
answered.
Yeah.

1704
01:10:24,441 --> 01:10:25,274
Because usually they tell the psychics 
that fed back later while they have 

1705
01:10:29,721 --> 01:10:30,554
these leading questions and then you 
give them partial answers and then they 

1706
01:10:33,081 --> 01:10:35,190
fish for more and then before you know 
it there,

1707
01:10:35,410 --> 01:10:36,111
you know,
you're all,

1708
01:10:36,111 --> 01:10:38,960
you're filling in the blanks together 
and they want to believe,

1709
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:39,823
you know,
and a lot of times there's like some 

1710
01:10:40,881 --> 01:10:41,714
weird social aspect to it,
like a hand holding or something like 

1711
01:10:44,391 --> 01:10:46,880
that where it's like this intimacy thing
where you don't,

1712
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:50,360
you don't want to be confrontational 
with this person.

1713
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,710
And so you sort of kind of helped them.
Yep.

1714
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:56,210
Your bolt in each other's space because 
you're only like two feet away from each

1715
01:10:56,211 --> 01:10:57,530
other.
It's odd.

1716
01:10:57,531 --> 01:11:00,790
There's a lot of oddness and a lot of 
real psychodrama.

1717
01:11:00,810 --> 01:11:01,643
Yeah.
I had a friend who worked the psychic 

1718
01:11:02,661 --> 01:11:03,494
friends network line back in the 
nineties when Dionne Warwick on that 

1719
01:11:06,711 --> 01:11:08,280
company.
And uh,

1720
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:09,850
he's,
he was a magician that,

1721
01:11:09,851 --> 01:11:10,684
you know,
couldn't quite make a decent living 

1722
01:11:12,531 --> 01:11:14,010
doing magic stuff.
So he did

1723
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:16,080
this on the side and it became fairly 
lucrative,

1724
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:17,303
so he told me,
you know,

1725
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:21,180
he operated from home and you just have 
another phone line and they send you the

1726
01:11:21,181 --> 01:11:24,840
calls and you get,
I think he got sixty cents on the minute

1727
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:25,201
and the company got,
you know,

1728
01:11:25,201 --> 01:11:27,690
it was three 95 a minute.
He got sixty cents on the minute,

1729
01:11:27,691 --> 01:11:31,590
but they rewarded you the longer you 
keep them on the subjects on the line,

1730
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:34,290
the more higher percentage you get of 
each minute.

1731
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:35,693
And uh,
so he would do this by working through 

1732
01:11:37,741 --> 01:11:38,574
different categories and mostly people 
call it night and weekends they're 

1733
01:11:40,891 --> 01:11:43,010
lonely and need somebody to talk to,
you know,

1734
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:43,801
love,
health,

1735
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:44,790
money,
career,

1736
01:11:44,910 --> 01:11:47,760
especially love relationships,
jobs,

1737
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:48,700
your boss,
you know,

1738
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:50,250
people would just Yak,
Yak,

1739
01:11:50,251 --> 01:11:51,084
Yak,
Yak.

1740
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:52,890
And then he got pretty good sort of 
like.

1741
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:56,430
The analogy I make is like with Dr 
Laura's Colin Talk Show,

1742
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:57,573
you know,
sees has a rich database of problems 

1743
01:11:59,611 --> 01:12:02,040
that people have,
why they call her and you know,

1744
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:02,370
every.

1745
01:12:02,370 --> 01:12:04,320
So every call she knows within 10 
seconds,

1746
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:05,610
oh,
it's problem number seven.

1747
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:06,713
It's number 16 year.
They get the one with the guy and he 

1748
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:11,940
just hone right in on it.
So these psychics,

1749
01:12:11,941 --> 01:12:16,941
they have a deep database of human 
psychology connected Dr Laura to it.

1750
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:21,930
Well,
she was just listen to that show.

1751
01:12:21,931 --> 01:12:24,120
Find similarities.
Absolutely.

1752
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:26,280
No,
not that she's running a psychic scam.

1753
01:12:26,281 --> 01:12:27,540
Not at all,
but that,

1754
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:28,463
but that the psycho,
there's only so many variations on of 

1755
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:31,793
human psychology and human nature.
What do people care the most about 

1756
01:12:34,951 --> 01:12:35,880
relationships,
you know,

1757
01:12:35,881 --> 01:12:36,790
love health.
Many career.

1758
01:12:36,791 --> 01:12:38,580
So you just work your way through those 
four.

1759
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:40,710
And then people just open up and pour 
stuff out,

1760
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:43,290
take a few notes and then like 45 
minutes later.

1761
01:12:43,291 --> 01:12:44,280
Well,
let's talk about your,

1762
01:12:44,281 --> 01:12:45,230
you know,
your uncle Bob.

1763
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:47,340
Bob,
how could he have known about uncle?

1764
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:50,070
Well,
you told them half an hour ago so people

1765
01:12:50,071 --> 01:12:50,904
forget that.

1766
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:54,060
So if you record them,
you video tape and more tape recorder.

1767
01:12:54,090 --> 01:12:56,280
It's very enlightening.
Um,

1768
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:57,193
uh,
I did a show with John Stossel when he 

1769
01:12:58,681 --> 01:13:00,950
was with ABC 20 slash 20 on,
on,

1770
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:01,793
uh,
John and James and Prague and they got 

1771
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:05,723
a,
they didn't tell Vanpraagh guy was 

1772
01:13:06,541 --> 01:13:08,850
involved,
but they taped them all day,

1773
01:13:09,570 --> 01:13:10,403
uh,
bringing people in to do readings and 

1774
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:16,500
cameras and set up and stuff like this.
And when you sit there with a counter,

1775
01:13:16,501 --> 01:13:17,334
like how many times has he asked this 
question or say these things and it's 

1776
01:13:19,861 --> 01:13:20,694
just hundreds.
And so his hit rate was maybe less than 

1777
01:13:23,911 --> 01:13:26,640
10 percent,
but they only remembered that,

1778
01:13:26,710 --> 01:13:27,180
that,
you know,

1779
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:31,320
the handful of the 10 percent and forgot
the hundreds of names he would throw out

1780
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:35,100
and comments he would make.
And so there's a confirmation bias.

1781
01:13:35,101 --> 01:13:35,541
There's a,
you know,

1782
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:37,170
a high data,
high data rate,

1783
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,033
you just pouring stuff out and then 
people pick out the ones that they 

1784
01:13:40,021 --> 01:13:42,600
remember and then we'd catch him 
cheating once in a while like,

1785
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:43,590
you know,
well,

1786
01:13:43,591 --> 01:13:44,190
let's take a break.

1787
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:45,023
Everybody break.
Then you leave the camera rolling and 

1788
01:13:46,981 --> 01:13:48,480
then he starts chatting with people you 
know.

1789
01:13:48,481 --> 01:13:50,950
So who are you here for?
Oh my aunt,

1790
01:13:50,951 --> 01:13:51,990
she passed over.
Okay.

1791
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:52,883
Yeah.
And then like half an hour later I'd 

1792
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:57,600
like to come to this woman here.
Now don't tell me who you're here for,

1793
01:13:57,601 --> 01:13:59,430
but I'm getting.
I see a woman on your,

1794
01:13:59,431 --> 01:14:03,290
over your left shoulder.
I don't want to say sister mother.

1795
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:05,640
Is it an aunt?
Oh my God.

1796
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:07,410
Yeah.
And it looks,

1797
01:14:07,411 --> 01:14:07,950
you know,
it's uh,

1798
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:10,740
it's edited and the way it looks,
you know,

1799
01:14:10,741 --> 01:14:12,220
like they,
they're really getting something.

1800
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:14,650
But when you,
when you really see it in operation,

1801
01:14:14,651 --> 01:14:18,490
you can see the whole thing unfolds 
completely as a psychodrama.

1802
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:20,890
Well,
we had this guy on the show,

1803
01:14:20,891 --> 01:14:22,900
his name is,
he's abandoned.

1804
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:24,173
I know he's great and it's fantastic 
because he's a magician and he does 

1805
01:14:28,601 --> 01:14:31,960
those psychic reading things,
but he'll tell you right away,

1806
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:35,170
this is a trick.
I am really good at it.

1807
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:38,680
I am not a psychic.
I have no psychic ability whatsoever,

1808
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:41,770
but I can't tell you how I'm doing this,
but I know how to do this.

1809
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:42,633
Right.
And he was bending spoons and doing all 

1810
01:14:44,561 --> 01:14:47,710
this craziness and you know,
did card tricks,

1811
01:14:47,711 --> 01:14:50,200
all kinds of crazy stuff where you go,
this is insane,

1812
01:14:50,201 --> 01:14:51,034
how is this possible?
But he was really adamant about letting 

1813
01:14:53,861 --> 01:14:56,170
you know,
like these people that are psychics that

1814
01:14:56,171 --> 01:14:58,120
are telling you about your future,
your past,

1815
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,830
they're all con people.

1816
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,140
They're all,
they're doing terrible things.

1817
01:15:02,141 --> 01:15:02,974
They're trying to pretend that you're 
dead relatives are communicating with 

1818
01:15:06,641 --> 01:15:09,130
you from the great beyond.
They're giving you this sense of hope,

1819
01:15:09,310 --> 01:15:11,680
but they're all scammers.
And you know,

1820
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:17,280
having a guy like that who's very 
skilled at that style of what we.

1821
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:19,780
I think he calls it,
he's a mentalist.

1822
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:20,830
A mentalist.
Yeah.

1823
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:22,690
It's,
it's amazing to watch though.

1824
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:24,280
It is.
God is so good at it.

1825
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:25,640
Bannon checks one of the best.
Yeah.

1826
01:15:25,641 --> 01:15:26,474
But he's also one of the,
sort of one of the leaders of a 

1827
01:15:28,121 --> 01:15:29,190
skeptical movement.
Yes.

1828
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:31,360
Which is ethical magic.
Yes.

1829
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:34,540
He's an entertainer and it's not doing 
anything horrible.

1830
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:35,433
You know,
he's not ripping anybody off and he's 

1831
01:15:36,551 --> 01:15:37,970
really adamant about it.
So I,

1832
01:15:37,971 --> 01:15:38,870
I love him.
Yeah.

1833
01:15:38,890 --> 01:15:39,723
I love what he was on a cruise with him 
on set one of these cruise ship things 

1834
01:15:43,571 --> 01:15:44,404
with other skeptics and uh,
so he did some of these mentalism stuff 

1835
01:15:47,621 --> 01:15:48,454
and he,
he told me how he did one of them and 

1836
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:50,733
he's,
he's pretty good about not telling the 

1837
01:15:51,371 --> 01:15:52,204
truth,
but I really pressed him on this 

1838
01:15:53,231 --> 01:15:54,064
particular thing when he would touch 
somebody like on the shoulder here and 

1839
01:15:56,811 --> 01:15:59,710
then you're blindfolded and then,
and then you would say,

1840
01:15:59,711 --> 01:16:01,760
I felt like you touched me on the same,
you know,

1841
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:02,890
the left shoulder,
that right.

1842
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:03,723
And you had a whole sequence of these 
things where the other person was 

1843
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:08,180
picking up on the queue of where he was 
being touched.

1844
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:10,750
So anyway,
I was just stunned by this,

1845
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:12,070
like,
how is he doing this?

1846
01:16:12,071 --> 01:16:14,450
I know he's not really psychic,
you know?

1847
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:16,450
And then he told me how he did it.
I'm like,

1848
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:17,830
Oh,
oh,

1849
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:21,500
that is so good and it's so simple,
but you can't tell us.

1850
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:24,410
Uh,
but,

1851
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:25,373
and,
and that's really probably the best 

1852
01:16:26,321 --> 01:16:27,154
reason why you don't want to know how 
the magicians do it because it's almost 

1853
01:16:29,261 --> 01:16:31,030
always super simple.
And like,

1854
01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:31,943
Oh,
I should've seen that penn and teller 

1855
01:16:34,601 --> 01:16:36,760
was penn.
Jillette teller really doesn't talk that

1856
01:16:36,761 --> 01:16:37,594
much,
but there was an old show that was on 

1857
01:16:39,911 --> 01:16:44,320
television in Australia or radio,
I think it was on radio or television,

1858
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:48,190
I don't remember.
But there was this trick that they did.

1859
01:16:48,530 --> 01:16:53,530
Um,
and it was the way the pen like,

1860
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,510
god damn it,
I'm trying to,

1861
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:57,670
I'm struggling to remember how exactly 
it worked,

1862
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:00,150
but it was this woman who could,
uh,

1863
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:03,220
she,
she could tell the future or she could,

1864
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:04,113
she could some sort of psychic ability.
And penn explained it and the way he 

1865
01:17:08,471 --> 01:17:10,130
explained it,
he didn't want to explain

1866
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:13,580
it like they did it on the rate is for 
radiolab,

1867
01:17:13,610 --> 01:17:15,770
radiolab podcast.
And they explained it on there.

1868
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,240
I'm doing a terrible Job explaining 
this,

1869
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:20,450
but when you hear the explanation,
I won't give it out because I don't want

1870
01:17:20,451 --> 01:17:21,980
to ruin it for anybody who hasn't heard 
it before.

1871
01:17:21,981 --> 01:17:23,600
But when you hear the explanation,
you go,

1872
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:25,570
oh god,
yeah,

1873
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:29,990
that's it.
Of course fuckers fuckers.

1874
01:17:29,991 --> 01:17:31,460
But,
but having that,

1875
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:34,520
the ability to sneaky trick people like 
that.

1876
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:35,743
But you can make a lot of money if 
you're an unethical person and you can 

1877
01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:41,780
fool a lot of people and you know,
but like one of the examples I use,

1878
01:17:41,781 --> 01:17:44,180
you know penn and teller do the cups and
balls,

1879
01:17:44,210 --> 01:17:45,043
but they use clear plastic cups so you 
can see where the ball is and how it's 

1880
01:17:49,071 --> 01:17:51,110
being done.
But you still,

1881
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:52,690
you still get fooled.
Yes.

1882
01:17:52,850 --> 01:17:54,320
Because the power of the,
you know,

1883
01:17:54,321 --> 01:17:55,154
the sort of following his gaze or 
following the movement of the hand and 

1884
01:17:58,370 --> 01:17:58,970
this and that.

1885
01:17:58,970 --> 01:18:03,340
It's done so well that you still miss it
with a clear plastic with it.

1886
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:06,440
So this is a good example where even 
knowing the trick,

1887
01:18:06,441 --> 01:18:07,274
you might still be fooled.
What is it about people that want to 

1888
01:18:10,071 --> 01:18:11,420
fund the.
Is it,

1889
01:18:11,490 --> 01:18:14,880
is it something about the search for 
human knowledge?

1890
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:15,723
Like the thing that's always inside of 
people where they're trying to find out 

1891
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:21,680
where's the food,
where's the enemy coming from?

1892
01:18:21,681 --> 01:18:22,514
What's going to happen in the future as 
it seems to be like some search for 

1893
01:18:25,010 --> 01:18:30,010
human knowledge that is a part of 
people's desire to uncover mystery.

1894
01:18:30,910 --> 01:18:31,743
You know,
there's almost like a genetic calling 

1895
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,400
find.
well,

1896
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,960
what it is is just,
it's just learning and survival.

1897
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:39,823
So I call this patternicity the tendency
to find meaningful patterns in both 

1898
01:18:42,621 --> 01:18:43,454
meaningful and meaningless noise.
And my thought experiment is imagine 

1899
01:18:45,741 --> 01:18:48,590
you're a hominid on the plains of africa
three and a half million years ago,

1900
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:51,320
small brain australopithecine,
your name is lucy,

1901
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:53,510
and that you hear a rustle in the grass.

1902
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:56,000
Is that a dangerous predator or is it 
just the wind?

1903
01:18:56,570 --> 01:18:57,403
So if you assume that the rustle in the 
grass is a dangerous predator and it 

1904
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:01,610
turns out it's just the wind,
that's a type one error,

1905
01:19:01,611 --> 01:19:02,444
a false positive,
you thought a was connected to be but 

1906
01:19:04,311 --> 01:19:07,340
but no harm you,
you just become skiddish and cautious or

1907
01:19:07,341 --> 01:19:09,230
whatever.
But if you assume that the rustle in the

1908
01:19:09,231 --> 01:19:12,920
grass is just the wind and it turns out 
it's a dangerous predator,

1909
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:13,933
your lunch just been given a darwin 
award for taking yourself out of the 

1910
01:19:16,581 --> 01:19:20,000
gene pool early before reproducing.
So in other words,

1911
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:23,540
it's better to just assume that all 
things you think Are connected,

1912
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:26,990
all rustles in the grass are dangerous 
predators and not the wind,

1913
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:28,880
just in case,
and there's not.

1914
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:31,610
There's not a big cost to pay for making
a type one error,

1915
01:19:31,611 --> 01:19:32,444
a false positive.

1916
01:19:32,610 --> 01:19:35,750
There is a higher cost for making a type
two error or false negative.

1917
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:39,770
So we assume that this is the basis of 
superstition and magical thinking.

1918
01:19:39,771 --> 01:19:43,520
We just assume that this is connected to
that you pull the slot and you do this,

1919
01:19:43,521 --> 01:19:45,290
you pull the slot machIne,
you win or whatever,

1920
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:49,910
and this is what skinner show back in 
the fifties where you just randomly give

1921
01:19:49,911 --> 01:19:50,744
reinforcements to rats and pigeons and 
whatever they were doing just before 

1922
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:55,610
they got rewarded.
They'll just repeat that behavior.

1923
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:56,653
Even if it's like twirling 
counterclockwise twice and that's the 

1924
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:03,380
basis of superstition it.
There's nothing wrong with their brains.

1925
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:07,040
They're just trying to find causal 
connections between events,

1926
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:10,290
the environment,
and that's the basis of survival.

1927
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:14,370
So all of us are subject to making those
connections.

1928
01:20:14,371 --> 01:20:17,670
Some are more gullible than others.
Say are more skeptical,

1929
01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:22,260
but for the most part all of us can 
easIly be fooled if it's done right.

1930
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:24,300
That's.
that's the beauty of good cons,

1931
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,940
good scams is that anybody could fall 
for them,

1932
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:29,280
even smart people,
and if anything,

1933
01:20:29,281 --> 01:20:30,114
smart people are more likely to believe 
weird things in this sense that once 

1934
01:20:33,751 --> 01:20:35,640
they believe it,
they think they've drawn a connection.

1935
01:20:35,641 --> 01:20:39,630
They're Better at rationalizing the 
reasons why they believe than say,

1936
01:20:39,631 --> 01:20:41,610
less educated or less intelligent 
people.

1937
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:43,950
And so as people like panacek will tell 
you,

1938
01:20:43,951 --> 01:20:46,770
there's nothing better than an audience 
of scientists at mit.

1939
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:47,663
Oh boy,
I can really fool them because they 

1940
01:20:50,581 --> 01:20:53,430
think they're so smart.
I can't be full to wow,

1941
01:20:53,431 --> 01:20:55,740
okay.
He must be doing something really,

1942
01:20:55,741 --> 01:20:58,860
really super psychic because you know,
I'm super smart,

1943
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,390
but.
Well no,

1944
01:21:00,391 --> 01:21:04,140
because all of our sensory apparatus 
works the same and magicians know how to

1945
01:21:04,141 --> 01:21:06,980
manipulate your gaze,
your attention,

1946
01:21:06,990 --> 01:21:08,520
whatever,
and had a fool you.

1947
01:21:08,770 --> 01:21:13,590
this is so weird how people are drawn to
trying to uncover mystery so you know,

1948
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:14,473
whether it's ghosts or whether it's a 
like how many goddamn go shows do they 

1949
01:21:17,681 --> 01:21:21,700
have to have where no one ever sees it 
knows they stop having go shows.

1950
01:21:21,701 --> 01:21:23,620
I know those things drive me crazy.

1951
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:27,470
We don't do very many issUes like on 
astrology.

1952
01:21:27,471 --> 01:21:30,890
Is it real?
It's like we took care of this,

1953
01:21:30,891 --> 01:21:31,970
you know,
decades ago.

1954
01:21:31,971 --> 01:21:32,960
There's nothing new.

1955
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:36,110
Okay.
Astrology as far as like,

1956
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:36,981
you know,
hey,

1957
01:21:36,981 --> 01:21:39,740
you're a leo,
so you're inclined to be a leader.

1958
01:21:39,741 --> 01:21:40,574
Like that kind of bullshit.
But is there anything to those really 

1959
01:21:44,301 --> 01:21:47,140
complex astrological readings?
Were they,

1960
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:51,560
they look for the time of day you were 
born and mercury's and retro.

1961
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:53,480
Yeah.
Have you looked into that?

1962
01:21:54,090 --> 01:21:56,210
I know nothing about it.
Nothing to it.

1963
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:57,140
Nothing at all.
Nope.

1964
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:58,043
Absolutely nothing.
It's all in the psychology of the 

1965
01:21:59,401 --> 01:22:02,490
reading.
So if you mix up somebody's reading for,

1966
01:22:02,491 --> 01:22:03,480
you know,
you're a leo,

1967
01:22:03,481 --> 01:22:04,314
but you know,
we gave you the virgo reading or 

1968
01:22:05,521 --> 01:22:07,360
whatever for that day.
Almost everybody go,

1969
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:08,210
yeah,
boy,

1970
01:22:08,210 --> 01:22:10,170
that's all total hustle.

1971
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:11,110
Yeah,
all of that.

1972
01:22:11,170 --> 01:22:13,120
What about nancy reagan?
She believed,

1973
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:14,400
I don't understand what you're saying.

1974
01:22:16,110 --> 01:22:17,790
Yes.
God rest her soul.

1975
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:22,470
God rest her soul didn't use a psychic.
She consulted a little bit.

1976
01:22:22,471 --> 01:22:24,150
I mean,
they got played up quite a bit,

1977
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:25,493
uh,
for ronnie's travel schedule a little 

1978
01:22:27,421 --> 01:22:28,081
bit.
Uh,

1979
01:22:28,081 --> 01:22:28,914
I don't think we can say that state 
decisions were made based on 

1980
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:32,550
astrological readings

1981
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:34,330
and it could've also been like,
you know,

1982
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:38,140
you always know someone who has a wacky 
husband or a wacky wife,

1983
01:22:38,141 --> 01:22:40,480
that believability shit.
And then the person sort of like,

1984
01:22:40,481 --> 01:22:42,820
oh dear,
what did you say?

1985
01:22:42,821 --> 01:22:43,930
Okay,
I'll listen.

1986
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:44,793
You know,
how I don't think president reaGan was 

1987
01:22:46,510 --> 01:22:48,090
paying much attention to it.

1988
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:50,580
He wasn't paying much attention to 
anything towards the end,

1989
01:22:50,930 --> 01:22:51,763
you know,
but,

1990
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:52,613
uh,
but this desire to uncover hidden 

1991
01:22:56,821 --> 01:23:00,180
mysteries is always been really 
confusing to me because,

1992
01:23:00,181 --> 01:23:01,980
uh,
myself personally,

1993
01:23:01,981 --> 01:23:05,030
I've felt the pole like,
especIally like aliens and ufo,

1994
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:06,003
like I went

1995
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:06,701
deep,
deep,

1996
01:23:06,701 --> 01:23:07,930
deep into like,
uh,

1997
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:10,280
when I was real young.
Um,

1998
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:15,000
I um,
cut into the roswell thing and uh,

1999
01:23:15,030 --> 01:23:15,863
there's a lot of different connections 
with the roswell conspiracy about this 

2000
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:24,870
crashed ufo in New Mexico in 1947 and 
all the eye witness reports and boy,

2001
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:26,733
you go down the rabbit hole of that 
thing and you could waste years of your 

2002
01:23:28,811 --> 01:23:29,621
life.
You know,

2003
01:23:29,621 --> 01:23:33,220
there was a study done In a,
it was a ufo report.

2004
01:23:33,221 --> 01:23:34,054
Then in the late fifties,
I think it was 59 on the 500 most 

2005
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:41,380
important ufo cases of the last 20 
years.

2006
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:45,190
Roswell wasn't even on the list,
but how is it not on the list?

2007
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:49,450
Roswell didn't become roswell until 1980
when there was a made for tv movie.

2008
01:23:49,451 --> 01:23:54,451
And then charles berlitz that language,
a book publisher,

2009
01:23:55,211 --> 01:23:57,130
he got into,
they got me those fucks,

2010
01:23:57,160 --> 01:24:00,930
those books going after van donican,
chariots of the gods,

2011
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:01,780
that bestseller.

2012
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:04,780
Then book started pouring out about 
aliens and ufo.

2013
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:05,623
And then there was the movie,
remember when the chariots of the gods 

2014
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:09,580
of the film was released in the 
theaters.

2015
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,590
I remember leonard nimoy and search.
Oh yeah,

2016
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:15,060
man,
a conjecture and was,

2017
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:17,020
was a great job.
I loved that,

2018
01:24:17,021 --> 01:24:18,820
I used to watch that show,
but that's,

2019
01:24:18,910 --> 01:24:21,100
that got me in a big foot.
But that's an example of,

2020
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:22,900
of um,
you know,

2021
01:24:22,901 --> 01:24:25,320
how the popular media drives a lot of 
these things.

2022
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:27,970
What do we really know back then?
Nothing.

2023
01:24:27,971 --> 01:24:29,680
I mean,
it was just a couple of little anomalous

2024
01:24:29,681 --> 01:24:31,420
things.
And here's an example,

2025
01:24:31,421 --> 01:24:32,141
you know,
conspiracy.

2026
01:24:32,141 --> 01:24:34,240
Okay.
So the government lied when they said it

2027
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:35,530
was a weather balloon.
Yes.

2028
01:24:35,531 --> 01:24:37,900
They did your surprise that governments 
lie really?

2029
01:24:38,350 --> 01:24:40,000
Because of course it was an national,
it was a,

2030
01:24:40,150 --> 01:24:40,983
it was a high altitude surveillance 
balloon listening for the acoustic 

2031
01:24:44,441 --> 01:24:47,380
signatures of a nuclear explosion in the
upper atmosphere,

2032
01:24:47,381 --> 01:24:48,214
but it's soviet.

2033
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:50,640
So of course when this debris came down 
and you know,

2034
01:24:50,770 --> 01:24:54,310
the farmer's field there outside of 
albuquerque have a roswell,

2035
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:55,593
New Mexico,
of course they're not going to come out 

2036
01:24:56,621 --> 01:24:57,590
and hold a press conference.
You go,

2037
01:24:57,591 --> 01:24:58,000
well,
let's see.

2038
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,170
Actually what we are doing is launching 
this project to listen to soviet.

2039
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:07,330
It was suspicious too when something 
becomes not just a story,

2040
01:25:07,331 --> 01:25:08,164
but it also becomes business.
And roswell became a giant business so 

2041
01:25:11,530 --> 01:25:12,610
much,
much later.

2042
01:25:12,670 --> 01:25:13,421
Uh,
you know,

2043
01:25:13,421 --> 01:25:14,254
again,
there were a bunch of sightings in the 

2044
01:25:15,881 --> 01:25:18,540
forties and fifties and,
but,

2045
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:21,850
but that's around the time that there 
was a lot of experimental aircraft,

2046
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:23,940
horse and so whenever,
but anybody says,

2047
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:24,793
well,
I saw this triangular shaped black 

2048
01:25:25,901 --> 01:25:27,820
thing.
Are you near an air force base?

2049
01:25:27,821 --> 01:25:30,820
Have you looked at pictures of the b two
bomber,

2050
01:25:30,821 --> 01:25:33,850
the stealth bomber?
It's sort of a delta shaped wing shaped.

2051
01:25:34,350 --> 01:25:35,183
And when it flies right over the rose 
parade every January 1st comes right 

2052
01:25:38,591 --> 01:25:41,380
over my house and altadena circles right
when it comes at you,

2053
01:25:41,650 --> 01:25:42,483
it's silent and it's this weird black 
because they painted that black paint 

2054
01:25:45,731 --> 01:25:46,564
that doesn't reflect and if you didn't 
know about it and you're out in the 

2055
01:25:48,881 --> 01:25:53,590
desert and it's dusk and yeah,
it's like a big kind of spooky.

2056
01:25:53,591 --> 01:25:58,591
Like what I saw one when I was a film 
and fear factor in 2002.

2057
01:25:59,261 --> 01:26:01,480
So it was right after september 11,
not far,

2058
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:04,310
not long afterwards.
And we were filming out there

2059
01:26:04,850 --> 01:26:09,850
in a way out in the desert area.
Palm dale,

2060
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:11,503
I guess it wasn't.
Yeah.

2061
01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:12,523
And it's real close to the air force 
base and we saw a stealth bomber flying 

2062
01:26:16,761 --> 01:26:18,850
over and it looks like an alien space.
Yeah,

2063
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:21,050
it's amazing when you see one,
you're like,

2064
01:26:21,051 --> 01:26:21,884
whoa.
Like if you didn't know and you had 

2065
01:26:23,991 --> 01:26:25,910
never heard one of those before and you 
looked up in the sky,

2066
01:26:25,911 --> 01:26:28,670
you'd be sure that that came from 
another planet.

2067
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:29,533
I mean,
it looks like it's right out of star 

2068
01:26:30,201 --> 01:26:34,160
wars in the eighties and nineties there 
were ufo sightings in America.

2069
01:26:34,161 --> 01:26:36,530
And the ufo is looked strangely like 
blimps.

2070
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:38,210
That's weird.
Yeah.

2071
01:26:38,210 --> 01:26:39,043
So that,
that's the kind of thing people see 

2072
01:26:40,251 --> 01:26:41,300
weird things.
And again,

2073
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:44,630
the propensity is not to just say,
I saw an anomaly.

2074
01:26:44,690 --> 01:26:45,530
Wow.
I don't know.

2075
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:47,240
That's weird.
And leave it at that.

2076
01:26:47,330 --> 01:26:49,280
Our mind immediately goes back to your 
idea.

2077
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:51,590
We love the mystery.
Let's concoct this whole thing.

2078
01:26:51,670 --> 01:26:52,503
The martians are coming and it's the 
aliens and there's a whole nother 

2079
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:57,080
worldview.
Um,

2080
01:26:57,110 --> 01:26:58,020
and uh,
you know,

2081
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:58,990
it's like this,
um,

2082
01:26:59,000 --> 01:26:59,833
there's this anomalous star kic with a 
bunch of numbers that dims about 20 

2083
01:27:04,161 --> 01:27:06,890
percent every period of time,
whatever that is.

2084
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:09,770
It's about 1400 light years away.
So,

2085
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:10,633
uh,
and the astronomers study in this 

2086
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:13,131
decide,
okay,

2087
01:27:13,131 --> 01:27:15,770
it's not planets,
it's not comments coming around in front

2088
01:27:15,771 --> 01:27:18,170
of us that dims the light.
Um,

2089
01:27:18,190 --> 01:27:20,060
so,
so immediately people go to.

2090
01:27:20,061 --> 01:27:20,894
It's a dyson sphere.
It's a gigantic solar collecting array 

2091
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:27,200
that circles around the planet that 
collects energy from the sun.

2092
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:28,600
Oh,
this is a recent story.

2093
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:30,590
Reasons.
So,

2094
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:33,080
but you know what?
I did some radio shows,

2095
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:34,880
uh,
locally about this.

2096
01:27:34,881 --> 01:27:36,940
And immediately the host go to will.
Well,

2097
01:27:36,941 --> 01:27:38,430
whAt do they like?
What,

2098
01:27:38,810 --> 01:27:40,250
what does,
who like the aliens?

2099
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:41,000
Like,
no,

2100
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:41,450
no,
no.

2101
01:27:41,450 --> 01:27:44,780
All of this we have is just an anomaly 
in the light,

2102
01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:47,060
you know,
signature of this start.

2103
01:27:47,061 --> 01:27:48,360
That's all we have.
We don't have.

2104
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:50,780
The Problem also with social media is it
becomes click bait.

2105
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:51,673
It becomes someone writes a blog or 
someone has a thing and there's a video 

2106
01:27:54,381 --> 01:27:55,214
that's linked to it and then everybody 
starts sending that out to their 

2107
01:27:57,561 --> 01:27:59,390
friends.
And before you know it,

2108
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:00,800
that becomes the narrative,
right?

2109
01:28:00,801 --> 01:28:01,430
Yep,
that's right.

2110
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:05,030
Found some sort of a gigantic satellite 
that's orbiting.

2111
01:28:05,050 --> 01:28:07,250
Whether it's like a death star that's 
reading this planet,

2112
01:28:07,251 --> 01:28:08,900
it dims it because it comes into,
you know,

2113
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:10,800
between us and that,
yeah,

2114
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:11,833
that kind of stuff is very confusing to 
a lot of people because you don't have 

2115
01:28:13,941 --> 01:28:16,280
enough time to really research it right 
now.

2116
01:28:16,281 --> 01:28:17,114
That's why something like what you do,
like skeptic magazine or the entire 

2117
01:28:20,361 --> 01:28:22,940
skeptic community is a great resource 
and snopes,

2118
01:28:22,941 --> 01:28:23,774
snopes.com.

2119
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,510
Snopes is fantastic where it breaks down
and goes,

2120
01:28:26,511 --> 01:28:27,344
okay,
here's what we absolutely know for a 

2121
01:28:29,751 --> 01:28:31,310
fact.
So look at that.

2122
01:28:32,450 --> 01:28:33,980
It's okay to just say,
I don't know.

2123
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:36,260
Yeah,
but I just always hard to remember that.

2124
01:28:36,530 --> 01:28:41,530
I've always been so confused as to what 
it is about what I mean.

2125
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:46,550
I've known grown adults that have spent 
years and years with real life,

2126
01:28:46,551 --> 01:28:50,180
like fascinated with big foot,
you know,

2127
01:28:50,181 --> 01:28:54,300
fascinated with ufo is fascinated with 
these mysteries and you,

2128
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:57,530
when you look at the amount of resources
that they,

2129
01:28:57,830 --> 01:29:00,530
they actually expand chasing after these
things and say,

2130
01:29:00,531 --> 01:29:02,160
well if you that into like something

2131
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,310
positive,
something constructed a,

2132
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:05,820
my god,
you know,

2133
01:29:05,821 --> 01:29:06,540
you,
you would,

2134
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:07,373
you would do so well.
Like I often see that thing about like 

2135
01:29:09,571 --> 01:29:11,920
certain scammers and I'm like,
my god,

2136
01:29:11,921 --> 01:29:14,940
if these people just started a business 
with the same amount of enthusiasm,

2137
01:29:14,941 --> 01:29:16,470
right,
how good would they be doing?

2138
01:29:16,471 --> 01:29:17,490
Right?
I mean,

2139
01:29:17,491 --> 01:29:18,790
those guys running the,
the,

2140
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,760
uh,
internet scams and stuff,

2141
01:29:20,761 --> 01:29:22,860
what if they just did a legitimate 
company,

2142
01:29:22,861 --> 01:29:26,160
they'd probably make more money.
What is it about mysteries?

2143
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:30,230
That's one of the real important things 
that I wanted to talk to you about.

2144
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:31,073
I think one of the appeals of the ufo 
aliens thing is it's kind of a secular 

2145
01:29:34,681 --> 01:29:35,514
religion because they're often portrayed
as god like figures and if you don't 

2146
01:29:38,611 --> 01:29:41,310
believe in the traditional god,
then that is kind of,

2147
01:29:41,350 --> 01:29:43,500
they're out there.
They're very powerful.

2148
01:29:43,501 --> 01:29:46,100
They know about us.
They're coming to rescue us,

2149
01:29:46,101 --> 01:29:46,830
save us.

2150
01:29:46,830 --> 01:29:49,760
So much of science fiction is,
you know,

2151
01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:51,890
has these kinds of themes to it.
Uh,

2152
01:29:51,930 --> 01:29:54,990
like the day the earth stood still,
that classic 1951 film,

2153
01:29:55,530 --> 01:29:56,363
michael,
randy as klaatu and the ship comes to 

2154
01:29:58,861 --> 01:30:02,940
Washington dc.
It's a christ allegory that he's come to

2155
01:30:02,941 --> 01:30:04,320
talk to the authorities,
you know,

2156
01:30:05,370 --> 01:30:07,590
humans are sending.
We have to stop this,

2157
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:08,453
this case,
it was nuclear war and the remake with 

2158
01:30:09,361 --> 01:30:10,194
keanu reeves.
It was global warming and the 

2159
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:13,213
authorities want to see him.
So he mingles among the common people 

2160
01:30:14,821 --> 01:30:15,654
like jesus did.
And then he takes up with the Patricia 

2161
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:22,520
Neal character who's the single mom in 
the town and uh,

2162
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:23,953
and,
and then he's killed by the authorities 

2163
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:27,810
and he's putting the more you put in 
this morgue,

2164
01:30:27,811 --> 01:30:28,644
which is sort of like the tomb.
And then in that famous scene where 

2165
01:30:31,111 --> 01:30:35,160
Patricia Neal goes to the robot,
he's standing there and the pfizer comes

2166
01:30:35,161 --> 01:30:38,380
up and he's going to zapper and she 
gives him the famous message,

2167
01:30:38,381 --> 01:30:40,050
you know,
gore cloud to burrata,

2168
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,090
nick,
which basically says,

2169
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:43,310
go get clapped.

2170
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:45,150
At least he's in the,
he's in the tomb.

2171
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:46,333
So he,
he marches over to the tomb and burns a 

2172
01:30:48,241 --> 01:30:49,650
hole in it,
takes the body,

2173
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:52,070
returns it to the ship and resurrection 
right there.

2174
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:53,530
Jesus.
It's like,

2175
01:30:53,570 --> 01:30:56,670
it's his name in the,
in the movie was Mr.

2176
01:30:56,670 --> 01:30:57,503
Carpenter,
earthly name mr carmen are interested 

2177
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:01,110
in.
And in the original script,

2178
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:02,540
um,
uh,

2179
01:31:02,610 --> 01:31:04,080
we're in the film.
She says,

2180
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:05,170
wow,
that's incredible.

2181
01:31:05,171 --> 01:31:07,680
You mean this is the power of science 
and technology in the future,

2182
01:31:07,990 --> 01:31:09,030
and the original script,
he says,

2183
01:31:09,031 --> 01:31:10,320
yeah,
this is where it's gone,

2184
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:14,680
but the brain censorship board,
1951 said you can't say that,

2185
01:31:14,710 --> 01:31:16,530
that you know,
americans will be offended by this.

2186
01:31:16,531 --> 01:31:19,260
So they changed the line and now he says
something like,

2187
01:31:19,261 --> 01:31:19,980
no,
no,

2188
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:22,110
no one has the power over life and 
death.

2189
01:31:22,470 --> 01:31:24,980
Only the great spirit can determine,
you know,

2190
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:27,590
was just some bologna line and,
but,

2191
01:31:27,591 --> 01:31:28,910
but,
but so much of,

2192
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:32,490
of the way we talk about aliens is that 
they are,

2193
01:31:32,491 --> 01:31:35,280
like,
I call them deities are atheists,

2194
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:38,250
they're like gods and the chariots of 
the gods.

2195
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:42,420
I mean that's kind of that thesis,
but it's not so far fetched in the sense

2196
01:31:42,421 --> 01:31:45,180
that if not that they've come here,
they probably haven't come here,

2197
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:48,240
but if they're out there and they 
probably are,

2198
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:49,553
there's good reasons to think there's 
extraterrestrials and if we encountered 

2199
01:31:52,371 --> 01:31:53,204
them,
they're not going to be behind us 

2200
01:31:54,270 --> 01:31:57,450
technologically because we wouldn't 
encounter them otherwise.

2201
01:31:57,780 --> 01:32:02,780
So if we do find a signal or whatever 
it's going to be from an advance how far

2202
01:32:02,801 --> 01:32:05,500
advanced,
so the chances of them being in parallel

2203
01:32:05,501 --> 01:32:08,770
with us on an evolutionary timescale,
virtually zero,

2204
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:09,673
you know they're going to be,
and if they're out of sync by just a 

2205
01:32:10,991 --> 01:32:13,360
little bit from when they started on 
their planet evolving,

2206
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:15,790
it would be millions of years in 
advance.

2207
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:16,803
And look what we've been able to 
accomplish just in say a hundred years 

2208
01:32:19,091 --> 01:32:22,510
of of technology,
50 years of computer technical.

2209
01:32:22,511 --> 01:32:24,210
Why would it have to be millions of 
years in advanced?

2210
01:32:24,210 --> 01:32:27,370
Couldn't it just be 100 or 100 years in 
advance of us?

2211
01:32:27,371 --> 01:32:30,520
If we're thinking about colonizing mars 
the next few decades,

2212
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:31,573
right?
You get some sort of an advanced 

2213
01:32:33,041 --> 01:32:33,874
civilization that has less conflict in 
us because of how long it takes to get 

2214
01:32:37,121 --> 01:32:37,954
from bacterial grade life to an 
intelligent communicating like probably 

2215
01:32:41,351 --> 01:32:43,690
three and a half billion years is how 
long it took here.

2216
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,690
So wherever,
whenever your plant it starts,

2217
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,553
the chances of it going to be in perfect
synchrony of every step along the way 

2218
01:32:50,471 --> 01:32:54,010
from bacterial grade life to big brains.
If anything,

2219
01:32:54,011 --> 01:32:57,460
it's probably going to be millions of 
years of difference in timescale,

2220
01:32:58,120 --> 01:32:58,953
just just on the biology.
So just randomly meet even to get to 

2221
01:33:01,931 --> 01:33:05,650
where we are.
It could be a million plus or minus just

2222
01:33:05,651 --> 01:33:06,484
to reach this level correct where we've 
reached just whatever billion years it 

2223
01:33:11,561 --> 01:33:12,970
was.
Didn't have to be.

2224
01:33:12,971 --> 01:33:13,610
That number.

2225
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:14,443
Could have been much longer,
could have been shorter or just started 

2226
01:33:16,421 --> 01:33:17,820
later.
We started earlier.

2227
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:19,173
We'll also,
we have to deal with the impact that 

2228
01:33:21,791 --> 01:33:24,760
killed the dinosaurs.
That could be all the random events that

2229
01:33:24,790 --> 01:33:25,990
happened.
It could be,

2230
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:29,790
they could be on a planet that doesn't 
have any random events like that or it'd

2231
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:30,633
be way ahead of,
or they could be on one that has a lot 

2232
01:33:32,261 --> 01:33:33,094
of them.
So the answer to the fermi paradox that 

2233
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:35,553
whereas everybody,
because they should have happened 

2234
01:33:36,341 --> 01:33:38,420
already,
is probably,

2235
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:39,363
uh,
the universe timi with bacterial grade 

2236
01:33:41,021 --> 01:33:41,854
life.
But the number of steps to get from 

2237
01:33:43,961 --> 01:33:47,650
there all the way to communicating 
technological society is enormous.

2238
01:33:47,770 --> 01:33:48,603
And so that winnows down the number of 
possibilities you can get all the way 

2239
01:33:52,451 --> 01:33:54,490
to,
to neanderthals like here on earth,

2240
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:55,810
you know,
they're big brain,

2241
01:33:55,870 --> 01:33:58,600
1500 ccs,
but the size of our brain maybe a little

2242
01:33:58,660 --> 01:33:59,493
bit larger.

2243
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:00,720
And uh,
you know,

2244
01:34:00,730 --> 01:34:02,860
they had fire,
they had tools.

2245
01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:07,450
I'm at tesco,
everything but disco,

2246
01:34:08,530 --> 01:34:09,363
uh,
and they had europe to themselves are 

2247
01:34:10,721 --> 01:34:11,554
about 300,000
years and there's no advancement in 

2248
01:34:13,211 --> 01:34:15,220
their toolkits.
They're all pretty much the same.

2249
01:34:15,830 --> 01:34:16,663
They never had cave paintings.
They didn't look like they had symbolic 

2250
01:34:19,121 --> 01:34:19,954
art like a homo sapiens did.
I believe their brains were larger 

2251
01:34:22,811 --> 01:34:25,510
though to deal with their larger bodies.
Well,

2252
01:34:26,350 --> 01:34:30,010
even when you correct for body size,
theiR brains are slightly larger,

2253
01:34:30,011 --> 01:34:30,844
but only slightly.
It may be the brain size may not make 

2254
01:34:32,621 --> 01:34:34,570
any difference.
Maybe brain modularity,

2255
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:37,480
maybe they didn't have language,
or if they did,

2256
01:34:37,481 --> 01:34:40,840
maybe they didn't have communicate 
symbolic language.

2257
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:43,690
We don't know why they went extinct.
but when humans,

2258
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:47,800
homo sapiens arrived in europe,
within a few tens of thousands of years,

2259
01:34:47,801 --> 01:34:48,634
there was no more a neanderthals gun.
They went extinct and there's a big 

2260
01:34:51,941 --> 01:34:53,740
debate paleoanthropology circles.

2261
01:34:53,740 --> 01:34:55,400
Why so?
But,

2262
01:34:55,410 --> 01:34:56,243
but my point is thAt you could have a 
three and a half billion years of 

2263
01:34:58,731 --> 01:35:02,360
evolution on a planet and get all the 
way to neanderthals who have stone tools

2264
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:04,220
and it just stops.
For whatever reason,

2265
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:06,590
they never developed symbolic 
communication.

2266
01:35:06,591 --> 01:35:08,900
They have opposable thumbs so they can 
make stuff,

2267
01:35:08,901 --> 01:35:11,630
they can make tools,
but they never make the next step.

2268
01:35:11,850 --> 01:35:14,390
Right now,
some people disagree with that.

2269
01:35:14,391 --> 01:35:15,050
They,
they,

2270
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:19,730
they think that had a homo sapiens,
not dominated europe when they came in.

2271
01:35:19,731 --> 01:35:23,510
Neanderthals might have gotten there 
within a few centuries more maybe,

2272
01:35:23,990 --> 01:35:24,620
but we,
you know,

2273
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:25,453
we don't know that well.
There's also the thought that even 

2274
01:35:26,451 --> 01:35:28,160
though the unIverse is infinite,
right,

2275
01:35:28,210 --> 01:35:32,690
that it had some sort of a beginning,
whether you buy or don't buy,

2276
01:35:32,691 --> 01:35:34,310
that there's actually been some 
arguments.

2277
01:35:34,510 --> 01:35:36,410
Wasn't there some arguments recently 
that the,

2278
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:39,080
perhaps the universe didn't have a 
beginning or an end,

2279
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:40,520
but that it's been an eternal.

2280
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:43,140
That's always been,
it could be eternally cycling there,

2281
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:45,770
there could be multiple big bang.
So there was never.

2282
01:35:45,830 --> 01:35:46,663
Yeah.
So the idea could possibly be that if 

2283
01:35:50,781 --> 01:35:51,770
that is the case.
Right?

2284
01:35:51,771 --> 01:35:52,604
So if you have an event and from that 
event things become more and more 

2285
01:35:56,301 --> 01:35:58,010
complex.
Start getting single cell life,

2286
01:35:58,011 --> 01:35:59,810
multicellular life like we have here on 
earth.

2287
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:05,060
There has to be a first like us first.
It has to.

2288
01:36:05,090 --> 01:36:06,950
Somebody has to be first.
Maybe first.

2289
01:36:06,951 --> 01:36:07,784
Yes,
that's what I'm saying.

2290
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:11,090
Like if I exist multigenerational our 
stars.

2291
01:36:11,091 --> 01:36:11,924
And so there's been many,
many generations of stars older than 

2292
01:36:13,941 --> 01:36:15,810
ours.
So this is the pheromone.

2293
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:16,873
Where is everybody.
I mean there should have been somebody 

2294
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:19,813
made it for.
But when you think about how complex 

2295
01:36:21,261 --> 01:36:23,510
life is on earth and how many different 
varieties of it,

2296
01:36:23,511 --> 01:36:24,344
and there's only one human,
there's only one technologically 

2297
01:36:26,331 --> 01:36:29,750
communicating species and where it so,
so is it possible?

2298
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:30,420
Yeah,
that's right.

2299
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:35,420
You got to have a planet teaming with 
life with dolphins and chimpanzees,

2300
01:36:35,541 --> 01:36:39,590
big brains.
And they lots of puppies and they never,

2301
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:40,990
they never built it,
you know,

2302
01:36:40,991 --> 01:36:42,410
they no laptops,
nothing.

2303
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:45,110
Yeah.
So it is possible that we,

2304
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:47,660
since we exist,
it is possible the,

2305
01:36:47,661 --> 01:36:49,660
we're the only ones that exist.
Uh,

2306
01:36:49,730 --> 01:36:51,620
it's possible.
It's totally possible.

2307
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:54,020
It's totally possible.
We just don't know.

2308
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:55,033
but that's terrifying.
The seti argument that search for 

2309
01:36:57,561 --> 01:36:59,030
extraterrestrial intelligence 
scientists,

2310
01:36:59,031 --> 01:37:02,060
these aren't the ufo people.
There are their counter argument to that

2311
01:37:02,061 --> 01:37:02,894
is there,
but there are so many planets now that 

2312
01:37:04,731 --> 01:37:05,564
we know about,
virtually every star in the galaxy of 

2313
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:08,783
100 billion stars has planet.
So we're talking hundreds and hundreds 

2314
01:37:11,991 --> 01:37:12,824
of billions of planets.
The chances that it never happened 

2315
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:16,550
anywhere,
you know?

2316
01:37:16,551 --> 01:37:17,450
Okay.
It's a small,

2317
01:37:17,610 --> 01:37:19,670
it's pretty small.
So they probably out there somewhere,

2318
01:37:19,671 --> 01:37:23,240
but it's a vast empty,
you know,

2319
01:37:23,241 --> 01:37:26,150
cosmos,
you know that there's a lot that we know

2320
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:29,510
that doesn't have intelligent life,
that a lot of plants,

2321
01:37:29,511 --> 01:37:31,940
right?
We have one planet that we know of,

2322
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,850
that as intelligent life at all the 
plants we've ever discovered.

2323
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:37,610
And obviously there's some that we've 
discovered that are so far out there,

2324
01:37:37,611 --> 01:37:40,490
we only get glimpses of what their 
atmosphere contains.

2325
01:37:40,670 --> 01:37:41,570
Well,
the next generation,

2326
01:37:41,571 --> 01:37:42,170
they'll,
they'll,

2327
01:37:42,170 --> 01:37:44,030
they'll be able to get the atmospheres,
the,

2328
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:46,170
uh,
the webb space telescope will,

2329
01:37:46,510 --> 01:37:48,620
I'm told they just getting it from a 
light spectrum.

2330
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:50,810
now in the,
in the spectrum,

2331
01:37:50,811 --> 01:37:52,550
you could see if there's oxygen,
for example,

2332
01:37:52,551 --> 01:37:53,384
in methane,
so they must have cows that are 

2333
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:56,370
forwarding methane.
Methane,

2334
01:37:56,940 --> 01:38:01,560
the british say to sound intelligent,
I try to use british.

2335
01:38:01,820 --> 01:38:02,653
You spelled tires with a y t,
y r e s c u under the hitchens and 

2336
01:38:08,431 --> 01:38:10,490
dawkins,
he's got that british accent.

2337
01:38:10,491 --> 01:38:13,800
It sounds so much better.
Super things and late night tv.

2338
01:38:13,801 --> 01:38:14,880
Absolutely.
Yeah.

2339
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:16,861
Yup.
It works.

2340
01:38:16,861 --> 01:38:18,480
So yeah.
Anyway,

2341
01:38:18,481 --> 01:38:20,280
the mystery.
You talked about us about the mystery.

2342
01:38:20,281 --> 01:38:21,060
Well,
you know,

2343
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:24,720
there's not quite sure why our brains go
toward that.

2344
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:27,690
I mean,
I'm sure my dog has a good life,

2345
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:30,150
but I don't think he contemplates the 
cosmos.

2346
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:34,140
Does dogs a loser,
especially when it's time for food.

2347
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:38,430
When I was trying to get at though is 
that there's,

2348
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:41,610
there's a thing that we do where it's 
not just.

2349
01:38:41,780 --> 01:38:42,240
I mean,
there's,

2350
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:45,090
there's the longing for extra 
terrestrial life,

2351
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:47,190
you know,
the search for the technological daddy,

2352
01:38:47,430 --> 01:38:47,941
you know,
the,

2353
01:38:47,941 --> 01:38:48,401
the,
uh,

2354
01:38:48,401 --> 01:38:51,600
advanced alien daddy that's out there 
that's going to show us the error of our

2355
01:38:51,601 --> 01:38:51,960
ways.

2356
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:53,100
There's,
there's that pole.

2357
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:54,233
but then there's also this weird poll 
where we want to believe that these 

2358
01:38:57,841 --> 01:38:58,674
intelligent beings from another planet 
can recognize who our elected leaders 

2359
01:39:02,131 --> 01:39:02,964
are and be In cahoots with them as if 
they give a shit about obama or 

2360
01:39:07,141 --> 01:39:07,861
anything.
I mean,

2361
01:39:07,861 --> 01:39:10,350
if you like descended upon an ant 
colony,

2362
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:13,200
would you have a deal with the queen?
Like,

2363
01:39:13,201 --> 01:39:14,034
look,
I know you're the one who in charge of 

2364
01:39:15,811 --> 01:39:18,400
this.
So I'll talk to you this election.

2365
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:23,420
You don't want to be super secretive and
since you are so moral and ethical,

2366
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:25,530
you know,
and you don't lie to your people at all.

2367
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:26,393
I'm only gonna communicate with you.
And in exchange for technological 

2368
01:39:29,761 --> 01:39:30,594
secrets,
I would like some dna like is so 

2369
01:39:32,491 --> 01:39:33,324
preposterous,
stupid idea that they would come down 

2370
01:39:35,881 --> 01:39:38,040
and they would talk to the military 
leaders,

2371
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:43,250
especially military leaders from the 
1940 [inaudible] who knew almost nothing

2372
01:39:43,591 --> 01:39:45,540
about technology or this idea that they,
you know,

2373
01:39:45,541 --> 01:39:46,374
at roswell know we capture when their 
spacecraft and back engineered their 

2374
01:39:49,471 --> 01:39:52,410
technology and that's where it's silicon
chips and computers came from.

2375
01:39:52,530 --> 01:39:54,570
Do you know about the american computer 
company?

2376
01:39:55,110 --> 01:39:55,943
Did you ever hear about these people?
There was a company called the american 

2377
01:39:57,931 --> 01:40:00,120
computer company and this was back 
during the,

2378
01:40:00,121 --> 01:40:00,954
um,
art bell days of a coast to coast with 

2379
01:40:03,601 --> 01:40:04,434
heartfelt wish.
I loved coming home many that I've been 

2380
01:40:08,191 --> 01:40:09,024
on it once to,
was the one of the highlights of my 

2381
01:40:10,141 --> 01:40:10,974
life.
I was recently when he came back on the 

2382
01:40:12,391 --> 01:40:13,224
radio or internet.
So I was driving home from the comedy 

2383
01:40:15,391 --> 01:40:16,650
store one night and they had this,
uh,

2384
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:21,090
they were talking about this american 
computer company and this guy that rents

2385
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,800
american computer company,
that was,

2386
01:40:23,630 --> 01:40:28,630
he's out of his fucking mind.
And he apparently he had this theory and

2387
01:40:29,281 --> 01:40:32,280
this whole website dedicated,
I don't know if it's up anymore,

2388
01:40:32,281 --> 01:40:33,114
they might have taken it down with,
is dedicated to showing the timeline of 

2389
01:40:36,181 --> 01:40:40,140
the creation of the transistor and all 
this came out of bell labs,

2390
01:40:40,290 --> 01:40:41,123
which is where they had the air force 
base outside of bell labs to protect it 

2391
01:40:45,631 --> 01:40:48,540
from alien invasion.
Oh my god.

2392
01:40:48,950 --> 01:40:51,510
And that this is where all of our 
technology came from.

2393
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:54,010
The we're supposed to Believe that the 
aliens were

2394
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:54,843
only about five to 10 years more 
advanced than us from vacuum tubes to 

2395
01:40:58,781 --> 01:41:02,080
the silicon transistors.
I mean,

2396
01:41:02,081 --> 01:41:04,610
really that's it.
That's the fiber optics.

2397
01:41:04,990 --> 01:41:05,823
They managed to traverse the best 
instance of interstellar space with 

2398
01:41:08,471 --> 01:41:09,304
technology.
Just barely better than vacuum tubes 

2399
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:12,280
with agera.
Pay attention to that.

2400
01:41:12,281 --> 01:41:13,840
Robert lasar guy.
he's.

2401
01:41:13,850 --> 01:41:15,190
Yes.
Bizarre ones.

2402
01:41:15,490 --> 01:41:17,800
He's a bizarre.
It sounds so good.

2403
01:41:17,890 --> 01:41:20,030
I think there are some people that just 
make stuff up.

2404
01:41:20,410 --> 01:41:23,170
He's so good at it though,
but he's also smart,

2405
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:28,200
which is fucking really scary because 
this guy came up with a hydrogen powered

2406
01:41:28,390 --> 01:41:30,610
engine for his corvette.
You know,

2407
01:41:30,611 --> 01:41:31,930
which people have done,
you know,

2408
01:41:31,931 --> 01:41:32,764
they're doing it now,
like people are developing hydrogen 

2409
01:41:34,931 --> 01:41:38,800
power plants for cars,
but he had this like decades ago.

2410
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:40,980
So he's obviously a very smart and 
smart,

2411
01:41:40,990 --> 01:41:41,823
doesn't,
uh,

2412
01:41:42,010 --> 01:41:44,220
doesn't protect you from believing and 
weird things.

2413
01:41:44,221 --> 01:41:45,010
Isn't that bizarre?

2414
01:41:45,010 --> 01:41:46,900
They are not just believing in weird 
things,

2415
01:41:46,901 --> 01:41:48,160
but bullshitting ps,
right?

2416
01:41:48,230 --> 01:41:48,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

2417
01:41:48,850 --> 01:41:51,280
Well then somebody who's smart,
educated is going to be better at,

2418
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:52,750
at bullshitting people.
Well,

2419
01:41:52,751 --> 01:41:55,150
he was.
He bullshitted people about is education

2420
01:41:55,151 --> 01:41:56,980
too though.
That was part of the problem.

2421
01:41:56,981 --> 01:41:59,700
I think some people went back and looked
through his education,

2422
01:41:59,710 --> 01:42:00,071
said,
well,

2423
01:42:00,071 --> 01:42:01,930
there's no evidence that you ever went 
to the school.

2424
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:05,410
And so that,
that through some monkey wrenches into.

2425
01:42:05,630 --> 01:42:06,463
He was one of the area.
Fifty one guys were saying worked at 

2426
01:42:08,081 --> 01:42:08,970
area 51.
Yep.

2427
01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:11,380
Well,
area 51 is a top secret.

2428
01:42:11,810 --> 01:42:14,960
A military base or they.
So you know,

2429
01:42:15,070 --> 01:42:16,630
you and I aren't gonna be able to drive 
there.

2430
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:18,920
Go wherever we're doing a show.
We want to blow the lid off these crazy.

2431
01:42:18,930 --> 01:42:20,410
You know,
you're still not coming in here.

2432
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:21,453
Oh,
okay.

2433
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:22,870
So what are you hiding?
Well,

2434
01:42:22,910 --> 01:42:23,743
you know,
of course there,

2435
01:42:24,130 --> 01:42:24,963
you know,
it'd be interesting to know now that we 

2436
01:42:25,781 --> 01:42:26,614
know about the b two stealth bomber,
what are they doing now that we won't 

2437
01:42:29,471 --> 01:42:30,304
find out for 20 more years that people 
are seeing out in the desert in the 

2438
01:42:32,651 --> 01:42:33,370
middle of the night?

2439
01:42:33,370 --> 01:42:34,360
I saw this spooky.
Weird.

2440
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:36,670
Definitely.
And that's how it works.

2441
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:40,240
We find out eventually in the meantime,
just say,

2442
01:42:40,241 --> 01:42:41,380
I don't know,
it's a weird thing.

2443
01:42:41,710 --> 01:42:42,311
Well,
the uh,

2444
01:42:42,311 --> 01:42:42,850
the,
the,

2445
01:42:42,850 --> 01:42:45,400
the oddest part about it is this belief 
that they're in,

2446
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:48,550
in conspiracy with our elected leaders,
that,

2447
01:42:48,620 --> 01:42:49,453
that one to me has been so strange that 
they will land somewhere and they have 

2448
01:42:52,901 --> 01:42:57,450
these meetings and these elected leaders
make deals with the ufo.

2449
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:00,890
How amazing would that be though,
if that was true courage?

2450
01:43:01,010 --> 01:43:04,360
They're reptilians are running the 
country from New Mexico.

2451
01:43:06,250 --> 01:43:10,980
people love this idea of blowing the lid
off of it.

2452
01:43:10,990 --> 01:43:13,330
You know,
that's something that people love.

2453
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:14,193
They love investigating.
They love the investigative journalism 

2454
01:43:17,681 --> 01:43:21,280
aspect of blowing the lid off this 
global conspiracy.

2455
01:43:21,730 --> 01:43:22,563
Well,
I think that's what drives some of the 

2456
01:43:23,550 --> 01:43:28,250
kind of anti medical establishment,
anti big pharma anti-vaccination,

2457
01:43:28,270 --> 01:43:29,260
you know,
those guys,

2458
01:43:29,261 --> 01:43:31,690
they're behind closed or the big 
powerful people,

2459
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:36,720
cOrporations and government agents,
the cdc and this company and the ceo and

2460
01:43:37,271 --> 01:43:37,790
the politic,
you know,

2461
01:43:37,790 --> 01:43:40,090
they're all and they want to make money 
and you know,

2462
01:43:40,130 --> 01:43:40,963
and,
and they,

2463
01:43:40,990 --> 01:43:41,823
they first,
they think they're more powerful than 

2464
01:43:43,091 --> 01:43:43,924
they really are.

2465
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:46,300
And second,
that's not how the world works.

2466
01:43:46,301 --> 01:43:47,134
I mean,
these people are not tryinG to keep us 

2467
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:51,100
poisoned or keep us sick so they can 
make money.

2468
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:52,010
You

2469
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:53,960
know,
it's the real conspiracies are,

2470
01:43:53,961 --> 01:43:55,640
you know,
how can we can't get our drugs cheaper?

2471
01:43:56,050 --> 01:43:56,571
Uh,
you know,

2472
01:43:56,571 --> 01:43:57,330
those are the,
you know,

2473
01:43:57,330 --> 01:44:00,170
what sort of behind the door deals are 
being done.

2474
01:44:00,550 --> 01:44:01,371
Uh,
you know,

2475
01:44:01,371 --> 01:44:03,290
that prevent healthcare from being 
cheaper.

2476
01:44:03,530 --> 01:44:05,570
That's where the real,
the real conspiracy.

2477
01:44:05,571 --> 01:44:06,404
I had a conversation with someone who's 
trying to tell me they already have a 

2478
01:44:07,731 --> 01:44:08,564
cure for cancer or they just don't want 
you to have the cure because then 

2479
01:44:11,331 --> 01:44:13,010
they'll know the money's in the 
treatment.

2480
01:44:13,220 --> 01:44:15,980
I gO,
why do you think the same person has the

2481
01:44:15,981 --> 01:44:16,814
cure as the the same people that are 
selling the treatment really think 

2482
01:44:20,721 --> 01:44:21,970
they're the same person.
Right?

2483
01:44:22,010 --> 01:44:26,030
Do you have any people work in the field
of creating new medicine?

2484
01:44:26,090 --> 01:44:26,923
I mean,
that's so ridiculous that it would be 

2485
01:44:27,630 --> 01:44:28,463
the one person of the tens of thousands 
of employees at amgen or wherever is 

2486
01:44:32,001 --> 01:44:32,420
going to,
you know,

2487
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:33,460
leave and go,
oh,

2488
01:44:33,620 --> 01:44:37,190
I found something out and I'm coming on 
your show to tell you I took pictures.

2489
01:44:37,190 --> 01:44:38,990
Here's was not one.
Well,

2490
01:44:38,991 --> 01:44:42,140
it just doesn't make any sense that it 
would be the same person.

2491
01:44:42,170 --> 01:44:45,200
The odds of it being the same person or 
the same company,

2492
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:46,353
the,
there's so many different people that 

2493
01:44:47,181 --> 01:44:49,850
work in the pharmaceutical industry.
So many different people that are trying

2494
01:44:49,851 --> 01:44:50,684
to do research on new medications and 
there's so much money involved in it 

2495
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:55,793
that there's one company would come up 
with a cure and they would like to keep 

2496
01:44:58,491 --> 01:44:59,324
it under wraps because they are in 
cahoots with the other company that's 

2497
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:03,620
got the treatment.
Right.

2498
01:45:03,621 --> 01:45:04,251
And so,
I mean,

2499
01:45:04,251 --> 01:45:07,670
if this were true then then all the 
people that were sick from polio and all

2500
01:45:07,671 --> 01:45:10,880
the Businesses and companies that were 
making money from polio patients,

2501
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:13,520
how come they didn't stop the polio 
vaccine?

2502
01:45:13,660 --> 01:45:15,220
Right?
Or you know,

2503
01:45:15,230 --> 01:45:16,220
just pick any,
any,

2504
01:45:16,221 --> 01:45:17,054
you know,
any particular industry like that where 

2505
01:45:18,591 --> 01:45:19,940
we have made real progress.

2506
01:45:19,970 --> 01:45:22,490
but then there are some things where you
go,

2507
01:45:22,580 --> 01:45:23,413
okay,
there's definitely too many people that 

2508
01:45:26,271 --> 01:45:28,270
are getting prescribed pain pills.
Like what?

2509
01:45:28,470 --> 01:45:30,710
What is going on?
And what is the conspiracy that I've,

2510
01:45:30,740 --> 01:45:31,573
I've had conversations with people that 
went to doctors now they have something 

2511
01:45:34,821 --> 01:45:36,650
wrong with them and the doctor wants to 
prescribe them.

2512
01:45:36,651 --> 01:45:37,484
I had a fucking nose operation.
I had a deviated septum repaired and my 

2513
01:45:40,521 --> 01:45:43,790
doctor gave me not one,
but two different opiates to take.

2514
01:45:43,850 --> 01:45:44,990
I didn't take anything.
My,

2515
01:45:45,210 --> 01:45:46,610
I wasn't in pain.
Okay.

2516
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:47,840
And he was like,
you're going to be in pain.

2517
01:45:47,841 --> 01:45:48,830
I'm like,
I'm telling you man,

2518
01:45:48,850 --> 01:45:50,960
I barely.
It's barely uncomfortable.

2519
01:45:50,990 --> 01:45:51,860
Well,
so again,

2520
01:45:51,861 --> 01:45:53,630
we know how some of this works.
You know,

2521
01:45:53,631 --> 01:45:54,464
the,
the drug companies take the doctors out 

2522
01:45:55,731 --> 01:45:58,160
on their golfing trips.
They give them free samples and this and

2523
01:45:58,161 --> 01:45:58,551
that.
Well,

2524
01:45:58,551 --> 01:46:03,050
my wife's mom was a nurse and they used 
to take them out to dinner.

2525
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:06,620
These pharmaceutical reps would talk to 
them and they want.

2526
01:46:06,910 --> 01:46:08,990
It wasn't like they said,
hey,

2527
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:11,540
we want you to tell these people to take
our drugs.

2528
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,673
It's,
they became friendly and they did nice 

2529
01:46:14,781 --> 01:46:15,614
things to them and it was almost 
understood that in exchange you would 

2530
01:46:18,771 --> 01:46:23,170
talk well about their drug or the 
principle of reciprocity for you.

2531
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:25,190
Now you owe me.
You don't even have to say it.

2532
01:46:25,260 --> 01:46:27,080
They wanted those trips.
They want.

2533
01:46:27,110 --> 01:46:29,510
You don't have to say it.
That's where it's interesting.

2534
01:46:29,540 --> 01:46:33,320
You don't have to say it right.
And so they're making money and that's,

2535
01:46:33,460 --> 01:46:34,710
that's reality.
I mean the,

2536
01:46:34,711 --> 01:46:35,544
the,
the sheer volume of pain pills that 

2537
01:46:37,821 --> 01:46:40,310
they've sold in this country since the 
19 eighties.

2538
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:43,880
It's stunning.
But also I saw this when my,

2539
01:46:43,881 --> 01:46:45,830
um,
my step dad was ill for,

2540
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:46,753
oh,
probably 10 years of just going through 

2541
01:46:47,990 --> 01:46:50,040
in his eighties,
just melting down one thing after

2542
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:52,680
another.
And I was the one taking them around all

2543
01:46:52,681 --> 01:46:55,460
the different docs and you know,
I could sort of see how it works.

2544
01:46:55,480 --> 01:46:55,951
He's like,
you know,

2545
01:46:55,951 --> 01:46:57,810
the dogs go look a dick.
I don't know.

2546
01:46:57,830 --> 01:46:59,340
I don't know what the problem is.
Well,

2547
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:01,750
can you give me something?
I'm in pain right?

2548
01:47:03,090 --> 01:47:04,590
Well doc,
come on,

2549
01:47:04,591 --> 01:47:06,090
I just drove down here.
All right here,

2550
01:47:06,330 --> 01:47:07,520
take this.
You know.

2551
01:47:07,670 --> 01:47:09,870
So they kind of feel like,
well I got to do something.

2552
01:47:09,871 --> 01:47:12,180
I don't know what it is.
I don't know what to do,

2553
01:47:12,181 --> 01:47:13,290
but okay,
he's asking me,

2554
01:47:13,291 --> 01:47:14,610
all right,
I'll give him some painkillers.

2555
01:47:14,611 --> 01:47:16,170
I'll give him this or that makes it feel
better.

2556
01:47:16,350 --> 01:47:17,670
And my dad would take it like,
yeah,

2557
01:47:17,671 --> 01:47:20,220
this is great.
There's certainly that.

2558
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:22,920
There's also certainly incompetent 
doctors.

2559
01:47:23,130 --> 01:47:23,963
There's doctors that are really willing 
to prescribe ssri antidepressants like 

2560
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:31,140
with alarming,
right?

2561
01:47:31,141 --> 01:47:31,950
Consistency.

2562
01:47:31,950 --> 01:47:32,783
So there you have the medicalization of 
what are really probably just social 

2563
01:47:35,611 --> 01:47:38,160
behavioral issues.
So you know,

2564
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:39,473
when we were kids in school and a little
johnny was super active and had high 

2565
01:47:42,661 --> 01:47:43,920
energy,
whatever.

2566
01:47:44,010 --> 01:47:44,843
Okay.
And now he's a great athlete or he's 

2567
01:47:46,201 --> 01:47:48,420
doing this or that.
And now he's like,

2568
01:47:48,421 --> 01:47:49,380
well,
what's wrong with him?

2569
01:47:50,020 --> 01:47:51,840
Oh,
well he has this medical pro.

2570
01:47:51,910 --> 01:47:53,040
Oh,
he's a d,

2571
01:47:53,041 --> 01:47:53,640
h,
d.

2572
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:54,473
Oh,
oh,

2573
01:47:54,510 --> 01:47:55,141
that's a thing.
Yeah,

2574
01:47:55,141 --> 01:47:56,490
it's a,
it's a medical issue.

2575
01:47:56,500 --> 01:47:57,900
It's like a disease.
Well,

2576
01:47:57,901 --> 01:47:59,060
what can we give them for it?
Well,

2577
01:47:59,061 --> 01:48:00,140
we'll give them,
you know,

2578
01:48:00,141 --> 01:48:02,640
these drugs here and okay,
so all of a sudden,

2579
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:03,913
you know,
the hyperactive little kid who's just 

2580
01:48:05,161 --> 01:48:09,180
kind of fun and maybe a little 
disruptive is now medicalized.

2581
01:48:09,700 --> 01:48:10,800
And it's the same thing with the,
you know,

2582
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:12,120
the autism spectrum,
you know,

2583
01:48:12,121 --> 01:48:12,840
people say,
well,

2584
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:14,280
you know,
increase in vaccinations.

2585
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:16,710
There's been an increase in autism,
not really.

2586
01:48:16,711 --> 01:48:19,800
The category got larger and it became 
medicalized,

2587
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:20,800
you know,
so.

2588
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:21,633
So there's no increase in autism cases.
It's the increase in the diagnoses of 

2589
01:48:25,261 --> 01:48:26,094
them at a more people paying attention 
to it and be the categories much bigger 

2590
01:48:30,181 --> 01:48:33,090
than it used to be.
So that's why it's called a spectrum.

2591
01:48:33,270 --> 01:48:34,103
So when people make the correlation 
between that and the increase in the 

2592
01:48:36,841 --> 01:48:39,570
amount of vaccinations to children,
it's a false correlation.

2593
01:48:39,571 --> 01:48:41,400
Yeah.
It says it's not true that the,

2594
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:44,790
that autism rates have gone up.
It's that in the,

2595
01:48:44,860 --> 01:48:48,300
in the nineties it's suddenly started 
becoming a thing,

2596
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:49,590
autism,
the spectrum,

2597
01:48:49,620 --> 01:48:50,453
talking about it.
And so somebody that was like so called 

2598
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:55,020
asperger's,
they're a little socially awkward.

2599
01:48:55,070 --> 01:48:56,820
Is that a word burglary?
Yeah.

2600
01:48:56,821 --> 01:48:57,654
Well,
I'm pretty sure I've heard the dude's a 

2601
01:49:02,101 --> 01:49:04,800
little ass burglary when someone's like 
really smart,

2602
01:49:04,801 --> 01:49:09,750
but socially to go to caltech or mit,
you know,

2603
01:49:09,751 --> 01:49:14,150
the big bang theory is not so far off on
the nerdy fact.

2604
01:49:14,150 --> 01:49:15,080
Yes.
But,

2605
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:16,113
but again,
it goes along with being false 

2606
01:49:17,191 --> 01:49:19,290
correlation.
What's wrong with being a little nerdy?

2607
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:20,153
Well,
now it's,

2608
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:21,940
you're on the autism spectrum.
Yeah.

2609
01:49:21,990 --> 01:49:24,300
You're on the spectrum that we,
the autistic,

2610
01:49:24,301 --> 01:49:27,150
yet you're,
and you have a disease and we have drugs

2611
01:49:27,151 --> 01:49:28,380
for this.
And before you know it,

2612
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:31,170
the categories bigger than there's more 
people in the box.

2613
01:49:31,650 --> 01:49:33,510
So it looks like it got bigger,
but it didn't.

2614
01:49:33,590 --> 01:49:36,690
If you're easily distracted also add.
Yeah.

2615
01:49:36,810 --> 01:49:38,400
Uh,
you have a disease,

2616
01:49:38,401 --> 01:49:39,660
you have add,
sir,

2617
01:49:39,870 --> 01:49:43,230
you need to take,
they call it a dos to attention deficit.

2618
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:43,591
Uh,
oh,

2619
01:49:43,591 --> 01:49:45,300
shiny,
right.

2620
01:49:45,660 --> 01:49:46,610
Does that.
So,

2621
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:48,090
but there have been.
There's

2622
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:48,933
also the very real problem with human 
beings in that there's so much 

2623
01:49:52,781 --> 01:49:53,614
biological diversity that medication 
that affects one person is going to 

2624
01:49:56,021 --> 01:49:57,670
affect another person that totally 
different way.

2625
01:49:57,880 --> 01:50:01,600
So if they give you a medication or your
body has no problem with that medication

2626
01:50:01,601 --> 01:50:02,434
whatsoever,
they give that same medication to 

2627
01:50:03,731 --> 01:50:05,320
another person.
There's going to be some issues.

2628
01:50:05,380 --> 01:50:06,700
And when people say,
well,

2629
01:50:06,970 --> 01:50:10,500
you know,
my child got vaccinated and some,

2630
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:13,060
there was some adverse reaction to the 
vaccination.

2631
01:50:13,650 --> 01:50:14,483
There's,
there's people that want to immediately 

2632
01:50:15,401 --> 01:50:16,300
dismiss that and say,
well,

2633
01:50:16,301 --> 01:50:18,040
that's malarkey.
That's junk science.

2634
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:19,113
But there is a very real situation that 
happens with human beings where they 

2635
01:50:21,851 --> 01:50:24,310
take medication where it does not agree 
with some of them.

2636
01:50:24,550 --> 01:50:25,383
Sort of how,
like some people have allergies to 

2637
01:50:27,401 --> 01:50:29,500
things that are completely innocuous to 
were I,

2638
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:30,440
you give,
uh,

2639
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:33,910
a certain type of nut to jamie and he 
might die.

2640
01:50:34,090 --> 01:50:34,620
You know,
there's,

2641
01:50:34,620 --> 01:50:38,640
there's a reality to that.
And when you look at the,

2642
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:39,633
this is what I've tried to explain to 
people that you talking about 

2643
01:50:40,750 --> 01:50:43,040
vaccinations being dangerous and you 
know,

2644
01:50:43,150 --> 01:50:46,360
we don't need vaccinations than other 
horrible the people.

2645
01:50:46,361 --> 01:50:47,194
And all the,
all the people that have like think 

2646
01:50:48,641 --> 01:50:50,470
about how many people you're talking 
about,

2647
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:55,270
you're talking about 300 million in this
country alone.

2648
01:50:55,630 --> 01:50:56,463
How many cases have,
are people that have vaccInations where 

2649
01:51:00,311 --> 01:51:03,160
things go wrong?
Is it a thousand a year?

2650
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:04,840
Well,
if it is a thousand a year,

2651
01:51:05,020 --> 01:51:07,470
do you know how low that is?
I know that's not low.

2652
01:51:07,471 --> 01:51:09,220
If it's your child,
it's awful.

2653
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:11,290
I know it's not love.
It's 10 a year.

2654
01:51:11,291 --> 01:51:12,610
If it's your child,
it's awful.

2655
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:16,600
But there's a lot of fucking People that
are being vaccinated.

2656
01:51:16,601 --> 01:51:17,434
If there really was this global epidemic
of you give kids vaccinations and they 

2657
01:51:21,911 --> 01:51:23,240
turn into,
you know,

2658
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:24,910
the decrepitude,
you know,

2659
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:28,630
mentally disabled child boy,
it'll be a lot bigger.

2660
01:51:28,830 --> 01:51:29,663
Be a lot bigger than it is because so 
many people were getting vaccinated 

2661
01:51:31,650 --> 01:51:34,810
exactly the right way to think about a 
million to one odds happened 300 times a

2662
01:51:34,811 --> 01:51:35,790
day in America.
Yeah,

2663
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:38,440
I can't think of it.
And that's a lot of people.

2664
01:51:38,441 --> 01:51:40,290
It's a lot of people just want to try to
explain to people.

2665
01:51:40,310 --> 01:51:43,240
When we talk about just the raw numbers 
of stupidity,

2666
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:45,093
I think that it's really conservative 
and really kind to say that one out of 

2667
01:51:49,660 --> 01:51:53,560
100 people are fucking idiots and 
there's not a damn thing to do.

2668
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:55,880
That's really,
that's openminded.

2669
01:51:55,900 --> 01:51:57,940
That's really looking at the bright side
of things.

2670
01:51:57,941 --> 01:51:59,890
That's a glass half full perspective,
right?

2671
01:52:00,070 --> 01:52:05,070
That means there's 3 million morons in 
this country and we know where they are.

2672
01:52:07,380 --> 01:52:09,100
That's a lot of people,
lot of people.

2673
01:52:09,310 --> 01:52:11,590
It's the sheer numbers that we deal 
with.

2674
01:52:11,620 --> 01:52:12,560
Whenever you know,
when,

2675
01:52:12,570 --> 01:52:15,250
when people started throwing these,
you know,

2676
01:52:15,251 --> 01:52:19,180
these theories around and they use this 
as their evidence.

2677
01:52:19,690 --> 01:52:23,080
I always try to just try to put it into 
that perspective.

2678
01:52:23,110 --> 01:52:25,510
You just stop and think about the 
numbers.

2679
01:52:25,690 --> 01:52:26,523
If you could see it on a board,
if you could see 7 billion human beings 

2680
01:52:31,421 --> 01:52:34,900
just as little dots on a board and then 
you know,

2681
01:52:34,901 --> 01:52:36,060
then let's,
let's find them.

2682
01:52:36,070 --> 01:52:37,510
All right,
then let's,

2683
01:52:37,511 --> 01:52:39,160
let's look at the problems.
Let's look at the.

2684
01:52:39,220 --> 01:52:40,480
Oh,
this is what we're dealing with.

2685
01:52:40,510 --> 01:52:41,343
We're dealing with is almost 
insurmountable numbers be like a cancer 

2686
01:52:44,780 --> 01:52:46,460
cluster who accepted to be a stupidity

2687
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:48,560
cluster because they're going to cluster
in various places,

2688
01:52:48,561 --> 01:52:49,394
easily cities probably,
and they'll find each other and then 

2689
01:52:52,431 --> 01:52:54,620
there's.
There's the confirmation bias that comes

2690
01:52:54,621 --> 01:52:58,460
from the groups getting together and 
only sharing information that correlates

2691
01:52:58,461 --> 01:52:59,294
to their beliefs,
whether it's big photo ufo lfos or 

2692
01:53:00,981 --> 01:53:04,200
psychics or.
That's why it seems like you know,

2693
01:53:04,250 --> 01:53:07,910
any of these groups that have people are
the big foot people or whatever it seems

2694
01:53:07,911 --> 01:53:08,241
like.
Well,

2695
01:53:08,241 --> 01:53:09,440
there's a lot of people.
Yeah,

2696
01:53:09,441 --> 01:53:10,610
well,
you know,

2697
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:13,100
there's maybe $100 a night club or 
something like that,

2698
01:53:13,101 --> 01:53:16,340
but it's a small number of people 
compared to the whole population.

2699
01:53:16,370 --> 01:53:20,810
will they get so mad?
They get so mad when you bring this up.

2700
01:53:20,811 --> 01:53:24,110
If you bring up these facts or this,
these thoughts,

2701
01:53:24,140 --> 01:53:26,780
these ideas,
and you tell these people that you don't

2702
01:53:26,781 --> 01:53:27,614
believe in ufos or you don't believe 
that we've ever been visited thinking 

2703
01:53:31,670 --> 01:53:34,400
emotionally men,
they are connected.

2704
01:53:34,610 --> 01:53:36,650
They're connected.
Yet they're,

2705
01:53:37,010 --> 01:53:37,790
they're,
they're,

2706
01:53:37,790 --> 01:53:38,623
they're connected.
Like who they are is connected to these 

2707
01:53:40,731 --> 01:53:43,420
Beliefs and the more psychologically 
invested you are in unbelief,

2708
01:53:43,490 --> 01:53:46,480
the harder it is to change your mind.
so this was,

2709
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:47,353
this is again an example of cognitive 
dissonance which was discovered by leon 

2710
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:54,710
festinger and uh,
december of 1954 on the 21st,

2711
01:53:54,711 --> 01:53:55,544
he went to the top of a hill with a ufo 
cult who was waiting for the mothership 

2712
01:54:00,230 --> 01:54:02,330
to come.
And he wanted to see,

2713
01:54:02,331 --> 01:54:03,164
well,
presumably the mothership is not going 

2714
01:54:04,101 --> 01:54:05,510
to come.
The world won't come to an end.

2715
01:54:05,511 --> 01:54:07,430
What will they do afterwards?
So he thought,

2716
01:54:07,431 --> 01:54:08,121
well,
I mean,

2717
01:54:08,121 --> 01:54:08,954
well,
they just changed their mind when they 

2718
01:54:09,471 --> 01:54:10,304
go home,
whatever.

2719
01:54:10,610 --> 01:54:14,540
So he recorded this and wrote a book 
about it called when prophecY fails.

2720
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:18,590
And the answer is they doubled down on 
their belief that they say,

2721
01:54:18,591 --> 01:54:19,850
well,
this was a dumb idea.

2722
01:54:19,850 --> 01:54:21,110
Let's go home.
You know,

2723
01:54:21,111 --> 01:54:21,944
they went home and started recruiting 
more people and while we miscalculated 

2724
01:54:24,731 --> 01:54:26,210
a,
it was eastern standard time.

2725
01:54:26,211 --> 01:54:27,044
It was tomorrow night or it's next year.
We've got to carry the one when we did 

2726
01:54:29,631 --> 01:54:31,520
our end of the world calculations.
And so,

2727
01:54:31,940 --> 01:54:34,460
and so they recruit more people to join 
the group,

2728
01:54:34,940 --> 01:54:37,070
so he called this cognitive dissonance 
that,

2729
01:54:37,100 --> 01:54:37,933
you know,
when you have a Belief that conflicts 

2730
01:54:39,051 --> 01:54:40,950
with the facts,
uh,

2731
01:54:41,120 --> 01:54:41,953
what gives well,
the facts have to give because the 

2732
01:54:44,121 --> 01:54:46,700
belief is right.
So we're going to get a spin doctor,

2733
01:54:46,701 --> 01:54:47,750
the fact that,
you know,

2734
01:54:47,751 --> 01:54:48,584
we know.
And so the rationalizations are just 

2735
01:54:50,810 --> 01:54:52,750
while we prayed and,
and,

2736
01:54:52,751 --> 01:54:53,584
and therefore god saved us,
or this was a test of our faith and god 

2737
01:54:56,571 --> 01:54:59,330
allowed us to live or,
or my favorite.

2738
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:01,890
The world didn't end.
And this is the new space.

2739
01:55:01,970 --> 01:55:03,380
It was a spiritual and dean.

2740
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:04,213
And we're in the new.
That's the loophole that the December 

2741
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:09,520
21st,
2012 people.

2742
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:10,400
Yeah,
that's right.

2743
01:55:10,530 --> 01:55:13,140
Yeah.
That one was one of my essay.

2744
01:55:13,170 --> 01:55:14,490
Right?
And yeah.

2745
01:55:15,170 --> 01:55:18,950
Spiritually in this new beginning,
new beginning.

2746
01:55:18,951 --> 01:55:19,370
Yeah.
Yeah.

2747
01:55:19,370 --> 01:55:20,203
I had a guy that I had a conversation 
with who really was absolutely adamant 

2748
01:55:23,991 --> 01:55:26,240
that the world was going to change 
december 20,

2749
01:55:26,241 --> 01:55:27,650
first 2012.
He's like,

2750
01:55:27,651 --> 01:55:29,780
it is undeniable.
It's going to happen.

2751
01:55:30,010 --> 01:55:31,370
I'm like,
how can you say that?

2752
01:55:31,970 --> 01:55:32,803
How can anybody say that?
It's definitely going to happen because 

2753
01:55:35,120 --> 01:55:38,510
it did change the day,
started getting longer after on December

2754
01:55:38,510 --> 01:55:39,343
22nd,
but it's also that the people that came 

2755
01:55:41,481 --> 01:55:42,314
up with this idea,
their culture doesn't even exist 

2756
01:55:43,951 --> 01:55:44,670
anymore.

2757
01:55:44,670 --> 01:55:45,503
I mean,
you're talking about the mayan 

2758
01:55:45,811 --> 01:55:48,150
civilization,
wonderful,

2759
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:49,313
spectacular,
advanced civilization that did all this 

2760
01:55:51,601 --> 01:55:52,434
amazing architecture and they had these 
really cool statues that they had built 

2761
01:55:56,581 --> 01:56:00,870
and really interesting language that was
sort of like hieroglyphic,

2762
01:56:00,890 --> 01:56:02,050
you know,
what,

2763
01:56:02,230 --> 01:56:03,150
what,
what is it called?

2764
01:56:03,160 --> 01:56:03,993
The.
It's a what does the type of language 

2765
01:56:07,921 --> 01:56:09,600
that they use,
but like where each,

2766
01:56:09,990 --> 01:56:10,823
each symbol symbol a symbol simpler,
but each symbol has a certain sound 

2767
01:56:15,901 --> 01:56:16,734
that's attached to it so you can have 
those symbols connected in different 

2768
01:56:20,041 --> 01:56:20,874
ways.
It's really interesting when there was 

2769
01:56:23,131 --> 01:56:23,964
a,
I'm a believer as a national geographic 

2770
01:56:25,831 --> 01:56:29,040
documentary on trying to decode,
I think it was called.

2771
01:56:29,970 --> 01:56:32,250
Yeah.
And these guys were,

2772
01:56:32,251 --> 01:56:33,084
they were trying to figure out exactly 
what these people were writing and how 

2773
01:56:35,761 --> 01:56:36,930
they wrote it.
Amazing.

2774
01:56:36,931 --> 01:56:37,960
I'm actually one of my,
uh,

2775
01:56:38,130 --> 01:56:40,710
cycling trading partners.
Nicco his father,

2776
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:42,600
michael coe at yale university.

2777
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:44,380
He was the guy that first crack the 
mayan code,

2778
01:56:44,590 --> 01:56:48,930
so I blamed his dad for,
for all this end of the world stuff.

2779
01:56:48,931 --> 01:56:50,010
Yeah.
Basically it was a.

2780
01:56:50,011 --> 01:56:50,844
It was a cyclical,
a time cycle instead of a times arrow 

2781
01:56:53,791 --> 01:56:57,480
that is these ages repeat themselves in 
these long,

2782
01:56:57,540 --> 01:57:00,840
long,
long form cycles and that december 20,

2783
01:57:00,841 --> 01:57:04,440
first 2012 was to whatever extent it was
coming to an end.

2784
01:57:04,441 --> 01:57:05,274
It was just a period of time,
like almost like our year comes to an 

2785
01:57:07,651 --> 01:57:08,484
end and a new year start.
Alls it is is the calendar is rolling 

2786
01:57:11,580 --> 01:57:12,413
over the next phase,
the end of the long count for the long 

2787
01:57:15,540 --> 01:57:18,510
couch and what happened is those people 
nothing.

2788
01:57:18,540 --> 01:57:20,170
They just quit talking about it.
I mean,

2789
01:57:20,171 --> 01:57:21,420
no,
almost no one ever says,

2790
01:57:21,421 --> 01:57:22,620
you know what?
I was wrong.

2791
01:57:23,220 --> 01:57:26,550
People just sort of drop it and go out.
I'm not into that anymore.

2792
01:57:26,610 --> 01:57:28,560
Well,
It was an industry that december,

2793
01:57:28,561 --> 01:57:32,130
21st thing was in industry for awhile 
and I thought it was awesome.

2794
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:33,750
I loved it.
I thought it was cool.

2795
01:57:33,751 --> 01:57:36,570
I even had a license plate and it said 
December,

2796
01:57:36,570 --> 01:57:37,403
2012.
I had a license plate he did because I 

2797
01:57:38,401 --> 01:57:39,900
thought it was hilarious.
It is hilarious,

2798
01:57:39,930 --> 01:57:43,050
but it's also cool,
like it's kind of fun to think that it's

2799
01:57:43,051 --> 01:57:45,900
really going to happen.
Like people have these ideas.

2800
01:57:46,050 --> 01:57:47,580
That's when the aliens are going to 
return.

2801
01:57:47,581 --> 01:57:49,410
That's what we're going to become self 
aware.

2802
01:57:49,770 --> 01:57:50,603
I think terence mckenna believed that's 
when people are going to come up with a 

2803
01:57:52,201 --> 01:57:53,034
time machine.
It was a bunch of like really 

2804
01:57:54,871 --> 01:57:57,810
fascinating ideas.
What the hell was going to go down.

2805
01:57:57,990 --> 01:57:58,823
But there seems to be this longing that 
people have for an event that we're 

2806
01:58:02,161 --> 01:58:04,050
building towards an event.
Well,

2807
01:58:04,051 --> 01:58:04,884
the idea is there's two dueling ideas is
the idea of progress in history and 

2808
01:58:07,861 --> 01:58:08,970
decline in history.

2809
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:10,253
And so when people write about it,
it's usually we're in a period of 

2810
01:58:13,081 --> 01:58:14,370
decline.
It's like,

2811
01:58:14,490 --> 01:58:16,000
like republicans right now,
you know,

2812
01:58:16,410 --> 01:58:19,140
America is the greatest nation ever 
except it's in a shit hole.

2813
01:58:19,141 --> 01:58:22,410
It's the worst it's ever been now 
because of this guy.

2814
01:58:22,411 --> 01:58:22,990
But,
but,

2815
01:58:22,990 --> 01:58:25,440
but,
but before we're going to return back to

2816
01:58:25,470 --> 01:58:26,580
the way it used to be.
Great.

2817
01:58:26,620 --> 01:58:30,720
So every generation has this.
Ours is the special generation,

2818
01:58:30,870 --> 01:58:31,703
either ours is culminating in this great
thing that's going to happen or things 

2819
01:58:35,281 --> 01:58:37,530
are terrible,
but if we could get through that,

2820
01:58:37,531 --> 01:58:39,540
they were the ones that are going to 
come out the other side,

2821
01:58:39,541 --> 01:58:41,110
the born again,
you know,

2822
01:58:41,111 --> 01:58:42,460
the left behind hers,

2823
01:58:42,850 --> 01:58:43,511
uh,
you know,

2824
01:58:43,511 --> 01:58:43,950
that,
you know,

2825
01:58:43,950 --> 01:58:45,400
the christian apocalypse,
you know,

2826
01:58:45,550 --> 01:58:47,530
there's plenty of secular versions of 
this.

2827
01:58:47,531 --> 01:58:49,210
You know,
mark'S has had this idea that,

2828
01:58:49,540 --> 01:58:50,373
you know,
the end of capitalism in the beginning 

2829
01:58:51,611 --> 01:58:54,490
of socialism and communism.
This is a big stage thing.

2830
01:58:54,980 --> 01:58:56,210
Um,
you know,

2831
01:58:56,230 --> 01:58:58,120
there's a lot of science.
Fiction is like this,

2832
01:58:58,620 --> 01:58:59,080
it,
it,

2833
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:02,950
it makes a drama better when there's a 
beginning point and end point.

2834
01:59:03,290 --> 01:59:06,910
We're at this crisis moment and things 
are going to be great again or,

2835
01:59:06,970 --> 01:59:07,803
or,
or they're going to come to an end and 

2836
01:59:08,510 --> 01:59:09,343
they'll be great.
But there's always that tension between 

2837
01:59:11,711 --> 01:59:12,544
decline and progress with is also this 
realization that there will be an end 

2838
01:59:15,911 --> 01:59:18,460
for you.
That we are finite beings.

2839
01:59:18,461 --> 01:59:20,080
We have a beginning,
we're born,

2840
01:59:20,081 --> 01:59:22,300
we have an end,
we die and it's gonna happen.

2841
01:59:22,330 --> 01:59:24,850
So when is it happening?
I don't know what I'm fucking scared.

2842
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:26,170
It's something coming.
Oh,

2843
01:59:26,171 --> 01:59:27,370
it's coming.
The apocalypse.

2844
01:59:27,371 --> 01:59:27,971
All,
jesus.

2845
01:59:27,971 --> 01:59:28,804
Here it is.
And then we find this thing and if 

2846
01:59:29,951 --> 01:59:30,784
you're really inclined to be gullible,
you know you get sucked into like the 

2847
01:59:34,780 --> 01:59:37,000
heaven's gate folks think,
well,

2848
01:59:37,001 --> 01:59:37,834
the way it's going to happen is there's 
a ufo behind this media and what we got 

2849
01:59:40,541 --> 01:59:41,374
to do is when the comment is near,
we gotta kill ourselves and wear purple 

2850
01:59:44,471 --> 01:59:45,304
nike's and then we'll live our art bell 
has a little bit of culpability in that 

2851
01:59:50,021 --> 01:59:50,854
because he was promoting the hale bopp 
comet ufo theory for quite a while on 

2852
01:59:55,241 --> 01:59:59,050
his show and they used to listen to that
show and that's when they bought.

2853
01:59:59,140 --> 01:59:59,973
They went down and bought a a telescope 
and to see if they could see it and 

2854
02:00:03,820 --> 02:00:05,180
they.
And so I'm in.

2855
02:00:05,190 --> 02:00:06,023
I'm not blind to it,
but I got into it by listening to that 

2856
02:00:08,381 --> 02:00:08,980
theory.

2857
02:00:08,980 --> 02:00:10,190
Promoted our bell.
Yeah.

2858
02:00:10,930 --> 02:00:14,330
So then when marshall applewhite said,
you know,

2859
02:00:14,350 --> 02:00:18,010
I think this is it.
This is all going to come with the comet

2860
02:00:18,070 --> 02:00:22,960
and comedy albums and little competition
when it comes to cult leaders,

2861
02:00:23,230 --> 02:00:26,140
it seems like once a cult leader has 
like that position,

2862
02:00:26,530 --> 02:00:27,363
like the,
they very rarely get forced out of the 

2863
02:00:28,751 --> 02:00:29,740
board,
you know?

2864
02:00:29,741 --> 02:00:30,431
No one says,
you know,

2865
02:00:30,431 --> 02:00:31,870
what?
Marshall's out of his fucking mind.

2866
02:00:31,930 --> 02:00:36,930
I'm not cutting my hair off because they
were treating themselves and you know,

2867
02:00:37,751 --> 02:00:39,200
and he was obviously.
So nadine,

2868
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:40,113
like,
did you not have one person in that 

2869
02:00:41,471 --> 02:00:42,970
group that you might have thought like,
well,

2870
02:00:42,971 --> 02:00:43,804
maybe,
maybe mike's got some better ideas in 

2871
02:00:45,041 --> 02:00:47,350
martial arts and mike doesn't work that 
way.

2872
02:00:47,970 --> 02:00:48,803
Usually those ones get purged.
Like in the mormon fundamentalist 

2873
02:00:51,401 --> 02:00:52,234
mormons.
They just purge anybody that wants to 

2874
02:00:53,561 --> 02:00:55,470
challenge the,
the elite,

2875
02:00:55,480 --> 02:00:56,313
the profit.

2876
02:00:57,130 --> 02:01:01,960
But so there's a critical point and 
every cult when the leader dies a well,

2877
02:01:02,010 --> 02:01:02,890
okay,
what happens?

2878
02:01:02,891 --> 02:01:06,940
Usually the cults just die with him.
But in the case of scientology,

2879
02:01:07,130 --> 02:01:08,400
uh,
wait,

2880
02:01:08,690 --> 02:01:10,490
what are you saying?
Scientology is a call.

2881
02:01:10,630 --> 02:01:11,980
Sorry.
Whoa,

2882
02:01:11,981 --> 02:01:13,690
dude.
We're in hollywood.

2883
02:01:13,730 --> 02:01:17,290
I do know that once you watch your 
mouth,

2884
02:01:17,380 --> 02:01:18,470
you know,
and uh,

2885
02:01:18,550 --> 02:01:20,800
uh,
when Joseph Smith was killed,

2886
02:01:21,480 --> 02:01:23,230
that could have been the end of the 
mormon church,

2887
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:24,970
but bring them young,
took over the reigns.

2888
02:01:24,971 --> 02:01:27,040
So if there's another charismatic 
leader,

2889
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:31,380
david miscavige and david miscavige took
over from l,

2890
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:32,233
ron,
and he was charismatic and people turn 

2891
02:01:33,731 --> 02:01:34,201
their,
you know,

2892
02:01:34,201 --> 02:01:36,010
they,
they acknowledged him as the,

2893
02:01:36,310 --> 02:01:39,770
as the new leader.
And one of my favorite moments in all of

2894
02:01:39,771 --> 02:01:40,340
comedy

2895
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:44,390
is when miscavige and tom cruise or on 
stage and they salute l ron hubbard,

2896
02:01:44,900 --> 02:01:46,720
lrh,
and they saluted.

2897
02:01:46,850 --> 02:01:49,670
There was a lot of testosterone and 
right there on that stage like,

2898
02:01:49,671 --> 02:01:51,620
oh boy,
man,

2899
02:01:51,650 --> 02:01:55,370
he's got a big,
gigantic embarrassing.

2900
02:01:56,220 --> 02:02:00,240
Not embarrassing at all.
So wonderful to me when this,

2901
02:02:00,310 --> 02:02:01,010
the,
the,

2902
02:02:01,010 --> 02:02:04,190
the human folly of it all.
You know,

2903
02:02:04,191 --> 02:02:08,330
the belief system of anybody that's an 
intelligent person by the way,

2904
02:02:08,540 --> 02:02:11,120
massively successful,
especially financially,

2905
02:02:11,121 --> 02:02:14,600
both of them financially,
but tom cruise culturally massively,

2906
02:02:14,601 --> 02:02:19,601
massively successful,
wearing a big gold plate on his neck and

2907
02:02:20,721 --> 02:02:24,170
saluting one of the worst science 
fiction authors of all time.

2908
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:25,910
I mean,
it is amazing.

2909
02:02:26,120 --> 02:02:28,000
Not to mention when he died,
he was,

2910
02:02:28,110 --> 02:02:31,400
he was a packed up with antidepressants 
and other drugs.

2911
02:02:32,150 --> 02:02:33,040
Allegedly.
Again,

2912
02:02:33,050 --> 02:02:33,970
it's exactly.
Yeah.

2913
02:02:34,180 --> 02:02:34,761
Yeah.
Well,

2914
02:02:34,761 --> 02:02:35,594
not only that,
how about the fact that he lived for a 

2915
02:02:37,131 --> 02:02:37,964
long time on a boat off the shore 
because he owed so much taxes they 

2916
02:02:40,640 --> 02:02:41,473
couldn't land.

2917
02:02:41,540 --> 02:02:42,373
Right.
So like that's where all the c corp and 

2918
02:02:43,671 --> 02:02:44,504
all that crazy shit.
He wrote more books than anyone who's 

2919
02:02:47,391 --> 02:02:50,630
ever lived.
He wrote more fiction than anyone ever.

2920
02:02:50,650 --> 02:02:52,580
Yep.
A mad fiction.

2921
02:02:52,620 --> 02:02:54,630
Horrible fiction.
Right.

2922
02:02:54,860 --> 02:02:58,070
Harlan ellison,
who I know is a science fiction writer,

2923
02:02:58,071 --> 02:03:00,240
says he was there at the meeting when l 
ron.

2924
02:03:00,380 --> 02:03:01,170
Well,
the,

2925
02:03:01,170 --> 02:03:02,003
the,
the meme is that he said if you really 

2926
02:03:03,261 --> 02:03:05,060
want to make money writing science 
fiction,

2927
02:03:05,061 --> 02:03:05,894
you started your own religion,
but actually was according to harlan 

2928
02:03:08,091 --> 02:03:08,924
ellison is there was a group of them 
just sort of sitting around complaining 

2929
02:03:12,171 --> 02:03:13,270
about the,
the,

2930
02:03:13,450 --> 02:03:14,270
the,
the,

2931
02:03:14,270 --> 02:03:16,460
the fees that people paid.
Writers.

2932
02:03:16,461 --> 02:03:18,740
Like all of us writers complained about 
we don't make enough money.

2933
02:03:19,130 --> 02:03:21,440
And so that's when somebody said,
well,

2934
02:03:21,441 --> 02:03:22,490
you know,
if,

2935
02:03:22,730 --> 02:03:24,630
if we started a religion and then 
they'll run,

2936
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:25,790
kind of jumped in and said,
yeah,

2937
02:03:25,791 --> 02:03:26,660
yeah,
let's start a really.

2938
02:03:26,930 --> 02:03:28,370
And then he actually went out and did 
it,

2939
02:03:29,090 --> 02:03:30,110
whereas the rest of them,
you know,

2940
02:03:30,111 --> 02:03:30,944
they just kept writing science fiction.
have you read a going clear red glow 

2941
02:03:34,190 --> 02:03:35,990
going clear?
I saw the film,

2942
02:03:35,991 --> 02:03:40,550
I mean films good.
Really the nana's because they have time

2943
02:03:40,551 --> 02:03:41,384
to go into depth about his past and all 
the stuff that transpired before he 

2944
02:03:46,251 --> 02:03:48,680
created scientology was given these 
film,

2945
02:03:48,681 --> 02:03:49,514
right?
Alex gibney film and lawrence wright's 

2946
02:03:51,471 --> 02:03:52,370
book.
That's right.

2947
02:03:52,371 --> 02:03:53,204
Yep,
yep.

2948
02:03:53,420 --> 02:03:53,991
Yeah,
laWrence.

2949
02:03:53,991 --> 02:03:54,824
Right.
It's a great dirt now that's real 

2950
02:03:55,851 --> 02:03:59,000
investigative journalist when you sink 
your teeth into those thing and bold,

2951
02:03:59,001 --> 02:03:59,834
right?
Yeah.

2952
02:03:59,930 --> 02:04:00,860
Yeah.
And it's amazing.

2953
02:04:00,861 --> 02:04:01,700
He got away with it,
you know,

2954
02:04:01,701 --> 02:04:03,020
because there are people trying to do 
that.

2955
02:04:03,021 --> 02:04:03,854
Back in the eighties,
there was a guy from time magazine that 

2956
02:04:05,660 --> 02:04:07,790
did the cover story with the volcano 
erupting on it,

2957
02:04:08,120 --> 02:04:08,953
and he was harassed and threatened and 
people put stuff in his mailbox and 

2958
02:04:11,751 --> 02:04:12,020
pizza.

2959
02:04:12,020 --> 02:04:14,000
Different world now though,
first of all,

2960
02:04:14,001 --> 02:04:14,834
their numbers have drastically declined.
Scientology's numbers have declined and 

2961
02:04:18,131 --> 02:04:21,110
then on top of that the internet is 
exposed it for what it really is.

2962
02:04:21,111 --> 02:04:25,670
RIght.
The before we did not like I went to one

2963
02:04:25,671 --> 02:04:29,330
of these things in san diego,
but just a few years ago,

2964
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:33,800
I think it was like was say like seven,
seven years ago,

2965
02:04:34,490 --> 02:04:35,323
they had one of these things where you 
had the e meter and you sat down there 

2966
02:04:38,061 --> 02:04:38,894
were given a free personality tests and 
I sat down and talked to the guys and 

2967
02:04:41,430 --> 02:04:45,750
they seem kind of like bored and 
disinterested and weird,

2968
02:04:45,751 --> 02:04:48,810
but you don't see those at all anymore.
You don't see those.

2969
02:04:49,020 --> 02:04:50,590
I don't think they even do that anymore.
Oh,

2970
02:04:50,591 --> 02:04:51,424
they do?
There's one that well on on hollywood 

2971
02:04:52,951 --> 02:04:55,650
boulevard right down there,
but building a.

2972
02:04:55,800 --> 02:04:56,490
No,
you could.

2973
02:04:56,490 --> 02:04:58,010
I've seen he meters on the street.

2974
02:04:58,020 --> 02:04:58,930
On the street.
Yep.

2975
02:04:59,690 --> 02:05:00,523
Jamie.
Right in front of a chinese theater 

2976
02:05:02,830 --> 02:05:06,420
after the going.
I asked the guy about that.

2977
02:05:06,690 --> 02:05:10,020
Have you seen this movie night and see 
that movie all propaganda.

2978
02:05:10,120 --> 02:05:10,953
Yeah,
that's right.

2979
02:05:12,120 --> 02:05:16,130
I ordered a book late night tv in 1994 
dianetics.

2980
02:05:16,131 --> 02:05:18,630
I was like,
I was going to Anthony Robbins self help

2981
02:05:18,631 --> 02:05:21,180
stuff trying to,
trying to get ahead in this life,

2982
02:05:21,181 --> 02:05:22,014
you know,
young man and I ordered that dianetics 

2983
02:05:24,211 --> 02:05:25,044
book.
Those people never stopped sending me 

2984
02:05:27,151 --> 02:05:27,984
shit,
never stopped sending me invites and 

2985
02:05:29,650 --> 02:05:30,483
this.
And did they get the numbers so we have 

2986
02:05:31,651 --> 02:05:33,720
millions of followers because anybody 
that ever,

2987
02:05:33,790 --> 02:05:37,300
I guess I'm a farmer on the list or was 
it.

2988
02:05:37,310 --> 02:05:38,550
Well,
so they don't have my new address.

2989
02:05:38,590 --> 02:05:41,840
You can still go clear if you would like
to,

2990
02:05:42,020 --> 02:05:43,800
to be clear.
I had a neighbor,

2991
02:05:43,870 --> 02:05:46,200
it's a horrible story.
Poor guy,

2992
02:05:46,470 --> 02:05:47,303
nice guy.

2993
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:48,353
But his,
um,

2994
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:50,820
I think poem,
I think he still lives down the street,

2995
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:52,410
but anyway,
his um,

2996
02:05:52,650 --> 02:05:55,740
there was a plot of land that he wanted 
to buy and we were talking about it,

2997
02:05:55,741 --> 02:05:56,640
you know,
and he's like,

2998
02:05:56,641 --> 02:05:59,700
well we can't do it right now because 
nancy's about to go clear.

2999
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:00,593
It was like,
what?

3000
02:06:01,060 --> 02:06:02,880
What does that mean?
I didn't know what it meant.

3001
02:06:02,910 --> 02:06:03,510
Oh,
you know,

3002
02:06:03,510 --> 02:06:04,340
wouLd have been okay.
I,

3003
02:06:04,340 --> 02:06:06,300
I only knew this,
you know,

3004
02:06:06,340 --> 02:06:07,173
it was probably [inaudible] 98.
I only knew a little bit about 

3005
02:06:09,181 --> 02:06:09,930
scientology.
It's like,

3006
02:06:09,930 --> 02:06:13,020
what do you mean go and clear?
Both were scientologists.

3007
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:17,070
I go going clear how much that cost 
$50,000.

3008
02:06:17,480 --> 02:06:20,100
$50,000
for like some ceremony.

3009
02:06:20,420 --> 02:06:20,881
And I go,
well,

3010
02:06:20,881 --> 02:06:22,590
what does it involve?
Well,

3011
02:06:22,620 --> 02:06:25,290
she's no longer affected by external 
influence,

3012
02:06:25,740 --> 02:06:29,070
so once she goes clear,
nothing will bother her.

3013
02:06:29,071 --> 02:06:29,904
Like you can say anything to her,
you could insult her and nothing will 

3014
02:06:32,251 --> 02:06:34,800
get in and she will write.

3015
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:35,940
But that's what everybody wants,
right?

3016
02:06:35,970 --> 02:06:37,590
everybody wants this,
this,

3017
02:06:37,640 --> 02:06:39,660
the,
the ability to be autonomous,

3018
02:06:39,661 --> 02:06:41,310
to be,
they just completely,

3019
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,940
completely free of any bullshit in this 
life,

3020
02:06:44,941 --> 02:06:48,540
this distress and the worry and the 
negativity.

3021
02:06:48,660 --> 02:06:49,493
So they sell you on that.
Like these are the things you need to 

3022
02:06:52,051 --> 02:06:53,040
get rid of.
Oh,

3023
02:06:53,041 --> 02:06:54,200
I didn't even know.
I mean,

3024
02:06:54,201 --> 02:06:55,170
part of the,
he made her thing,

3025
02:06:55,171 --> 02:06:55,950
you know,
it's just,

3026
02:06:55,950 --> 02:07:00,950
it's just measuring the voltage between 
your hands and skin conductance.

3027
02:07:01,050 --> 02:07:02,190
Um,
but,

3028
02:07:02,191 --> 02:07:03,450
you know,
think about your mother.

3029
02:07:03,451 --> 02:07:04,284
Okay?
I'm thinking about my wu spiked because 

3030
02:07:05,220 --> 02:07:07,140
I squeezed his hand slightly more.
All right,

3031
02:07:07,141 --> 02:07:08,040
let's talk about your mind.
well,

3032
02:07:08,041 --> 02:07:08,874
everybody has issues with parents with x
levers and spouses and bosses and you 

3033
02:07:13,710 --> 02:07:16,170
can find something and it's like,
would you like to get rid of that bad?

3034
02:07:16,320 --> 02:07:16,681
Well,
you know,

3035
02:07:16,681 --> 02:07:19,260
if you go meditate,
you know you go to a buddhist center,

3036
02:07:19,270 --> 02:07:20,103
they'll tell you the same thing.
You're focusing on the negative of your 

3037
02:07:22,261 --> 02:07:23,094
past.
We're going to clear that out by 

3038
02:07:24,181 --> 02:07:27,450
meditating.
So they're all very various forms of the

3039
02:07:27,451 --> 02:07:29,070
same kind of thing.
Like everybody has.

3040
02:07:29,270 --> 02:07:31,470
Like the psychic hotlines,
everybody has problems,

3041
02:07:31,471 --> 02:07:32,131
love health,
money,

3042
02:07:32,131 --> 02:07:32,964
car.
Everybody's got some issue and we're 

3043
02:07:34,621 --> 02:07:35,740
going to help for

3044
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:36,881
a fee.
Well,

3045
02:07:36,881 --> 02:07:40,150
what's fascinating about l ron is it 
seems like l rom was nuts.

3046
02:07:40,570 --> 02:07:43,840
I shouldn't use the word not.
He had some mental problems,

3047
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:45,393
mental problems,
and it seems like part of what 

3048
02:07:46,961 --> 02:07:47,794
scientology was,
was his attempt at self help and that 

3049
02:07:50,441 --> 02:07:51,274
was one of the things that Lawrence 
Wright went into that it seems pretty 

3050
02:07:53,531 --> 02:07:54,364
clear that this guy used all these 
available psychological techniques at 

3051
02:07:59,171 --> 02:08:03,940
the time to try to cure himself self 
help thing.

3052
02:08:04,870 --> 02:08:08,020
I think a lot of people go into 
psychotherapy because they themselves,

3053
02:08:08,200 --> 02:08:09,130
oh yeah,
uh,

3054
02:08:09,220 --> 02:08:10,780
you know,
have issues that they're dealing with.

3055
02:08:10,890 --> 02:08:11,723
When I was in college,
that was the only thing that was 

3056
02:08:12,401 --> 02:08:13,234
interesting to me.
It was psychology was interesting to me 

3057
02:08:15,011 --> 02:08:16,600
because I was trying to figure out my 
own brain.

3058
02:08:16,601 --> 02:08:17,061
I was like,
god,

3059
02:08:17,061 --> 02:08:20,410
I got a great fucking thing under,
under wraps being handled.

3060
02:08:20,650 --> 02:08:23,230
So that was the,
that was the one thing.

3061
02:08:23,490 --> 02:08:25,360
Robin's uh,
you know,

3062
02:08:25,361 --> 02:08:30,361
they kind of have a tracking the line 
between being a con artist.

3063
02:08:31,151 --> 02:08:35,440
He's not but selling something that 
could maybe help people maybe.

3064
02:08:35,441 --> 02:08:38,650
But if you follow his direction,
I think he,

3065
02:08:38,740 --> 02:08:40,310
he's more positive than negative.
I,

3066
02:08:40,311 --> 02:08:41,470
I agree.
I agree.

3067
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:43,360
I mean,
some of this stuff is pretty basic,

3068
02:08:43,361 --> 02:08:44,194
you know,
set goals and write them down and don't 

3069
02:08:46,781 --> 02:08:48,880
get distracted from these things.
Stay focused,

3070
02:08:48,881 --> 02:08:51,280
you know,
just pretty basic stuff that actually is

3071
02:08:51,281 --> 02:08:53,050
true.
It works if you work at,

3072
02:08:53,530 --> 02:08:54,363
and we did a story on the self help 
movement and skeptic by a guy wrote a 

3073
02:08:59,441 --> 02:09:02,860
book called sham,
the self help and actualization movement

3074
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:07,720
and the pr and this guy he used to work 
for rodale press,

3075
02:09:07,721 --> 02:09:08,554
which is one of the big publishers of 
self help books and in the marketing 

3076
02:09:11,501 --> 02:09:12,334
department said that the number one 
predictor of anybody who would buy one 

3077
02:09:14,801 --> 02:09:18,190
of these self help books is somebody who
had already bought a self help book.

3078
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:19,870
Well,
if they work,

3079
02:09:19,871 --> 02:09:23,890
why do you need to keep buying the tapes
and the books and all that stuff.

3080
02:09:23,891 --> 02:09:25,680
And the answer is,
is that it?

3081
02:09:25,850 --> 02:09:30,070
They only Work temporarily.
Like if you bring tony robbins into your

3082
02:09:30,071 --> 02:09:30,904
corporation,
he is for sure going to get your sales 

3083
02:09:33,131 --> 02:09:34,960
force really motivated,
man,

3084
02:09:34,961 --> 02:09:38,290
I'm going to make some common,
make 50 calls a day rather than 30 calls

3085
02:09:38,291 --> 02:09:39,124
a day and I'm going to really do this 
and they see a spike for a while and 

3086
02:09:42,431 --> 02:09:43,264
then people go back to their baseline 
where they were and that's why you got 

3087
02:09:46,280 --> 02:09:48,450
to keep listening to the tapes and,
and,

3088
02:09:48,451 --> 02:09:51,490
and,
and listening to the music and the books

3089
02:09:51,491 --> 02:09:53,380
and all that stuff to kind of keep it 
up.

3090
02:09:53,950 --> 02:09:58,030
So it only works to a certain extent and
for a limited period of time.

3091
02:09:58,120 --> 02:10:00,660
Well it's very difficult for people to 
change behavior patterns.

3092
02:10:00,680 --> 02:10:02,530
You have this pattern.
They're very comfortable.

3093
02:10:02,740 --> 02:10:04,760
It's very hard to change too,
right?

3094
02:10:04,930 --> 02:10:05,763
Don't they say it's like 90 days of 
doing something all the time for it 

3095
02:10:09,311 --> 02:10:10,144
becomes a habit.
It's like you can kind of ingrain a new 

3096
02:10:11,981 --> 02:10:15,160
path probably longer than that.
It's why diets are so difficult to work.

3097
02:10:15,161 --> 02:10:16,480
You know,
you have a lifetime of,

3098
02:10:16,810 --> 02:10:20,020
you have this fat level and you know 
this kind of food your body's used to.

3099
02:10:20,030 --> 02:10:21,090
And to shift it,
it,

3100
02:10:21,230 --> 02:10:23,050
it's not going to happen in weeks or 
months.

3101
02:10:23,051 --> 02:10:25,750
He really,
it's a lifestyle change for forever.

3102
02:10:25,751 --> 02:10:26,584
It really turned into a dial.
You can commit to a diet for a long 

3103
02:10:30,611 --> 02:10:32,860
period of time.
But a lot of people in the community,

3104
02:10:32,890 --> 02:10:34,010
like I have a,
I'm on a diet

3105
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:38,150
right now for 60 days.
Mark sisson's primal blueprint.

3106
02:10:38,210 --> 02:10:39,830
It's like,
it's sort of a ketogenic diet.

3107
02:10:39,831 --> 02:10:41,450
Okay.
Based,

3108
02:10:41,710 --> 02:10:44,740
um,
mostly hit a lot of fucking avocados.

3109
02:10:44,750 --> 02:10:47,220
Dude.
Avocados,

3110
02:10:47,600 --> 02:10:49,880
mct oil,
a lot of coconut oil,

3111
02:10:49,881 --> 02:10:52,100
almond butter,
a lot of healthy fats.

3112
02:10:52,280 --> 02:10:53,720
Like what'd you have for breakfast this 
morning?

3113
02:10:53,810 --> 02:10:56,620
I have five eggs and avocado.
You did.

3114
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,360
So you don't worry about cholesterol?
No.

3115
02:10:59,410 --> 02:11:01,490
Yeah,
pussy bro.

3116
02:11:03,320 --> 02:11:06,570
I'll be clinton dot clinton lost all 
that weight.

3117
02:11:06,571 --> 02:11:07,900
Get ready.
Was cardiovascular?

3118
02:11:08,530 --> 02:11:10,000
Yeah.
He wouldn't be pended.

3119
02:11:10,370 --> 02:11:11,840
Yeah.
What did he do?

3120
02:11:12,350 --> 02:11:15,350
He's vegan.
He went vegan is all plants.

3121
02:11:15,351 --> 02:11:19,320
He says basically huge salads a twice a 
day.

3122
02:11:19,420 --> 02:11:21,650
That's just great for you,
period.

3123
02:11:21,710 --> 02:11:22,940
That was great.
Great for you.

3124
02:11:22,941 --> 02:11:25,130
If you can eat more plants more the 
better.

3125
02:11:25,490 --> 02:11:27,540
But um,
figure adding more than plants.

3126
02:11:27,550 --> 02:11:29,660
So coconut butter and no.
Well,

3127
02:11:29,720 --> 02:11:34,720
the idea of systems idea is an system 
was a big ultra endurance guy as well.

3128
02:11:35,340 --> 02:11:36,173
It's the idea is that your body 
functions more efficiently on high fat 

3129
02:11:41,331 --> 02:11:45,110
content and it does on a high 
carbohydrate content.

3130
02:11:45,320 --> 02:11:47,780
So it's very low carbohydrate,
no added sugar,

3131
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:49,610
no grains whatsoever,
right?

3132
02:11:49,670 --> 02:11:51,170
No pastas,
no.

3133
02:11:51,580 --> 02:11:53,420
Here's what's interesting about it.
Um,

3134
02:11:53,780 --> 02:11:56,120
the mental clarity aspect of it is 
really interesting.

3135
02:11:56,660 --> 02:11:57,490
Different.
Yeah.

3136
02:11:57,490 --> 02:11:58,323
And I had a few friends that have tried 
the same diet and it was one of the 

3137
02:12:00,681 --> 02:12:01,514
things they pointed out and I think 
there's a certain amount of brain fog 

3138
02:12:05,271 --> 02:12:07,910
that comes from heavy carbohydrate meals
you avoid,

3139
02:12:08,750 --> 02:12:09,583
you avoid.
And then once Your body becomes into a 

3140
02:12:11,151 --> 02:12:11,984
state of ketosis,
which I think takes like 20 something 

3141
02:12:13,971 --> 02:12:16,730
days or there's,
there's a bunch of different supplements

3142
02:12:16,731 --> 02:12:19,850
like see this stuff right here.
This is a keto genic cream.

3143
02:12:20,500 --> 02:12:24,280
The product that you can add to coffee,
there's a bunch of different.

3144
02:12:24,310 --> 02:12:26,840
That's what you're putting in ketones 
now.

3145
02:12:26,840 --> 02:12:27,673
That is actually just because this stuff
is coffee with mct oil and grass fed 

3146
02:12:32,271 --> 02:12:34,130
butter.
Have you ever had that step before?

3147
02:12:34,410 --> 02:12:37,360
Is that what it's,
uh,

3148
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:39,160
from um,
uh,

3149
02:12:39,170 --> 02:12:40,003
robb wolf invention,
he figured out how to add grass fed 

3150
02:12:42,801 --> 02:12:44,900
butter,
mct oil,

3151
02:12:44,901 --> 02:12:45,734
which is a medium chain triglycerides,
essentially the healthiest aspects of 

3152
02:12:49,161 --> 02:12:50,840
coconut oil.
My headaches gone,

3153
02:12:50,930 --> 02:12:51,830
hey,
you feel better?

3154
02:12:52,400 --> 02:12:53,233
But um,
it's just a healthy fats and mixed in 

3155
02:12:55,731 --> 02:12:58,020
with coffee mate.
No,

3156
02:12:58,360 --> 02:12:59,730
I'm okay.
Yeah,

3157
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:00,753
yeah.
Alright.

3158
02:13:00,860 --> 02:13:01,693
But mostly I'm hearing my theory on 
diets that they work because you're 

3159
02:13:06,770 --> 02:13:07,603
doing something,
you're actively involved in keeping 

3160
02:13:09,381 --> 02:13:12,860
track of how many calories you go in and
you start cutting out the bad foods.

3161
02:13:12,861 --> 02:13:15,110
Definitely junk food,
sugars,

3162
02:13:15,230 --> 02:13:16,310
grained,
stuff like that.

3163
02:13:16,820 --> 02:13:17,653
And they work.
It doesn't matter if it's this 

3164
02:13:19,011 --> 02:13:20,180
particular one here,
this one,

3165
02:13:20,190 --> 02:13:23,180
the air,
it's the doing something about a problem

3166
02:13:23,360 --> 02:13:25,520
that that is what really works it.
Well,

3167
02:13:25,521 --> 02:13:26,750
I didn't even have a problem.
I did it.

3168
02:13:26,751 --> 02:13:27,584
Just try it.
I did it just because I wanted to feel 

3169
02:13:28,881 --> 02:13:30,040
what it would be like.
Yeah,

3170
02:13:30,080 --> 02:13:31,980
try this diet because I had

3171
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:32,813
read about citizen and he's a really 
interesting guy and then I'd also 

3172
02:13:34,591 --> 02:13:35,424
listened to a tim ferris podcast.
Tim ferriss had this great podcast With 

3173
02:13:39,480 --> 02:13:42,780
dr d'agostino.
I believe his name is who is.

3174
02:13:42,781 --> 02:13:47,781
I'm heavily into ketosis ketogenetic 
diets and the science behind it.

3175
02:13:47,990 --> 02:13:48,823
He's a really,
really brilliant guy and fascinating 

3176
02:13:50,761 --> 02:13:52,650
podcasts.
we have to listen to it like 10 times in

3177
02:13:52,651 --> 02:13:53,484
a row and take notes,
but one of the things that they brought 

3178
02:13:54,901 --> 02:13:56,670
up,
which is really interesting is the,

3179
02:13:56,671 --> 02:13:57,504
the mental benefits of it and the fact 
that it helps children with epilepsy 

3180
02:14:00,691 --> 02:14:05,610
when they put them on a ketogenic diet.
It stops epilepsy in its tracks.

3181
02:14:06,390 --> 02:14:07,590
I don't know about that one.
Yeah,

3182
02:14:07,591 --> 02:14:08,220
no,
it's a.

3183
02:14:08,220 --> 02:14:08,880
This is,
uh,

3184
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:10,470
this is,
I've researched it.

3185
02:14:10,471 --> 02:14:11,880
It's really,
really fascinating.

3186
02:14:11,881 --> 02:14:15,450
It's one of the main things they do to 
children that have child's epilepsy.

3187
02:14:16,020 --> 02:14:18,180
Other thing that people do when they get
on dice,

3188
02:14:18,181 --> 02:14:21,130
they also start exercising,
which has other benefits.

3189
02:14:21,160 --> 02:14:23,760
That's tons of benefits.
But I did that already too.

3190
02:14:24,030 --> 02:14:26,830
So for me it was,
it was just wanting to try,

3191
02:14:27,110 --> 02:14:27,943
want to try it for the athletic benefit,
wanting to try it for the physical 

3192
02:14:30,181 --> 02:14:32,370
benefit.
But I lost a lot of body fat.

3193
02:14:32,490 --> 02:14:33,360
You did?
Yeah.

3194
02:14:33,510 --> 02:14:34,343
And I wasn't fat,
but I definitely could have lost a 

3195
02:14:36,241 --> 02:14:37,650
little bit of weight,
you know,

3196
02:14:37,651 --> 02:14:39,600
but I mean not compared to like I still 
have a six pack,

3197
02:14:39,610 --> 02:14:43,680
like you can see my abs before I did it,
but I lost 10 pounds.

3198
02:14:43,681 --> 02:14:46,900
Now I'm down to one.
I think it was one 93 this morning and I

3199
02:14:46,901 --> 02:14:48,390
was somewhere around two.
Oh four before.

3200
02:14:48,391 --> 02:14:50,220
Okay.
It's kinda kinda fascinating.

3201
02:14:50,250 --> 02:14:51,450
And well,
will you have for lunch?

3202
02:14:51,870 --> 02:14:52,800
Um,
it's,

3203
02:14:52,990 --> 02:14:54,960
it depends,
but no grains.

3204
02:14:55,020 --> 02:14:56,940
That's the big one.
The big one is no grains,

3205
02:14:58,080 --> 02:14:59,520
no pasta.
No.

3206
02:14:59,580 --> 02:15:00,660
No.
You know,

3207
02:15:00,840 --> 02:15:02,100
just very low carbs.

3208
02:15:02,450 --> 02:15:05,730
Like I'm getting my protein from mostly 
wild game.

3209
02:15:06,060 --> 02:15:10,800
Mostly a elk and deer and things along 
those lines while hunting here.

3210
02:15:11,370 --> 02:15:13,710
Shoot your ass.
I don't necessarily do it all here.

3211
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:15,730
It's hard.
No.

3212
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:16,673
Santa monica canoga park.
That's not really a lot of meat to you 

3213
02:15:19,631 --> 02:15:22,290
if you had out here walking around,
but I do.

3214
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:23,153
But when you shoot an elk,
you get hundreds of pounds of meat to 

3215
02:15:25,651 --> 02:15:27,350
commercial freezers in the backfield.
Well,

3216
02:15:27,530 --> 02:15:28,321
yeah,
you live nearby.

3217
02:15:28,321 --> 02:15:29,310
I'll give you some.
Okay.

3218
02:15:29,370 --> 02:15:30,690
It's delicious.
It'S great for you too.

3219
02:15:30,700 --> 02:15:31,441
All rIght.
You know,

3220
02:15:31,441 --> 02:15:32,274
it's organic.
One hundred percent free of any 

3221
02:15:34,621 --> 02:15:37,540
antibiotics like bullshit buffalo and 
fosterage.

3222
02:15:37,590 --> 02:15:38,910
Ostrich meat is very,
very,

3223
02:15:38,911 --> 02:15:41,820
very good for it.
Very lean and healthy and it's a rich,

3224
02:15:41,850 --> 02:15:45,270
dark red meat filled with iron and 
nutrients.

3225
02:15:45,510 --> 02:15:46,610
But,
um,

3226
02:15:46,830 --> 02:15:47,663
the idea behind it is that you get your 
body to burn fat instead of 

3227
02:15:50,491 --> 02:15:53,170
carbohydrates because that's primarily 
with human.

3228
02:15:53,200 --> 02:15:54,033
that's why it's not to be confused.
Like the problem with the whole concept 

3229
02:15:57,421 --> 02:15:58,860
of paleo,
you know,

3230
02:15:58,861 --> 02:16:00,160
the paleo diet,
well,

3231
02:16:00,610 --> 02:16:03,450
the term can be debunked pretty easily 
because they say,

3232
02:16:03,630 --> 02:16:05,410
well,
in the paleolithic period,

3233
02:16:05,430 --> 02:16:08,490
people ate a lot of bread,
they eat a lot of state,

3234
02:16:08,491 --> 02:16:09,860
whatever they could find.
Yes,

3235
02:16:09,990 --> 02:16:11,030
yes.
And,

3236
02:16:11,040 --> 02:16:12,870
and,
and most hunter gatherers,

3237
02:16:12,871 --> 02:16:15,720
most of their calories come from the 
gathering part,

3238
02:16:15,721 --> 02:16:18,750
not the hunting part.
It's hard to hunt animals.

3239
02:16:18,751 --> 02:16:21,270
They don't want to be killed.
So it's,

3240
02:16:21,271 --> 02:16:25,320
especially back then they shitty bows 
and arrows and they didn't have guns was

3241
02:16:25,321 --> 02:16:29,740
very difficult unless you stumbled upon 
a herd of blind buffalo,

3242
02:16:30,480 --> 02:16:31,850
throw a spear out.
Right?

3243
02:16:33,720 --> 02:16:35,080
It's not that easy.
No,

3244
02:16:35,460 --> 02:16:37,670
I mean it's,
it's difficult today.

3245
02:16:37,720 --> 02:16:39,520
Defined,
really healthy.

3246
02:16:39,670 --> 02:16:42,460
I mean if you wanna,
if you want to hunt it yourself,

3247
02:16:42,520 --> 02:16:44,580
good luck.
It's a lot of effort.

3248
02:16:44,600 --> 02:16:45,370
Right.
You know,

3249
02:16:45,370 --> 02:16:50,370
and if you want to actually find really 
healthy meat other than grass fed beef,

3250
02:16:50,950 --> 02:16:53,080
their options are pretty severely.
What about alcohol?

3251
02:16:53,081 --> 02:16:55,930
Do you drink?
Very little because every now and then,

3252
02:16:55,931 --> 02:16:57,160
but there's sugar in that.
Yeah,

3253
02:16:57,220 --> 02:16:58,120
yeah,
yeah.

3254
02:16:58,180 --> 02:16:59,013
It converts to sugar.
Well the idea is that cookies and ice 

3255
02:17:01,511 --> 02:17:02,920
cream,
because that's got sugar is gone.

3256
02:17:02,980 --> 02:17:04,030
So the dairies.
Okay.

3257
02:17:04,031 --> 02:17:05,480
milk a.
Hey,

3258
02:17:05,500 --> 02:17:07,500
you can have belt,
but I'm not really sure.

3259
02:17:07,520 --> 02:17:08,353
I've never liked milk cookies,
but since I'm not eating cookies and 

3260
02:17:11,080 --> 02:17:12,230
milk.
Yeah.

3261
02:17:12,730 --> 02:17:13,750
Milk guy.
Yeah.

3262
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:16,010
I don't mind raw milk and milk.
I like,

3263
02:17:17,150 --> 02:17:20,470
I felt like homogenized and pasteurized 
milk.

3264
02:17:20,980 --> 02:17:21,813
Once you do that,
I mean it's great as far as you could 

3265
02:17:23,891 --> 02:17:27,100
store it in a store and it lasts for a 
long time,

3266
02:17:27,101 --> 02:17:29,260
but you're cooking out all the enzymes.
Right?

3267
02:17:29,320 --> 02:17:31,330
It's just not the best thing for your 
body.

3268
02:17:31,510 --> 02:17:32,343
Yup.
Problem also is if you don't do that 

3269
02:17:34,660 --> 02:17:36,250
then it's only good for a couple of 
days,

3270
02:17:36,440 --> 02:17:37,240
so.
Right.

3271
02:17:37,240 --> 02:17:40,330
ThAt's.
And you get sick and eggs.

3272
02:17:40,630 --> 02:17:41,411
Good.
I'm glad to hear that.

3273
02:17:41,411 --> 02:17:42,760
I like eggs.
Eggs are good for you,

3274
02:17:42,761 --> 02:17:43,594
man.
Yeah.

3275
02:17:43,630 --> 02:17:44,463
Eggs aren't bad and certain amount of 
cholesterol is actually important for 

3276
02:17:46,571 --> 02:17:48,600
your body.
Produce testosterone.

3277
02:17:48,860 --> 02:17:50,320
This actually,
you know,

3278
02:17:50,950 --> 02:17:53,640
for cellular growth.
Right?

3279
02:17:53,690 --> 02:17:57,670
So and eggs,
the one I get from my chickens,

3280
02:17:57,671 --> 02:17:58,780
I have chickens.
You do?

3281
02:17:58,850 --> 02:18:00,340
Yeah.
That's great.

3282
02:18:00,730 --> 02:18:01,730
That's good.
Good for you.

3283
02:18:01,731 --> 02:18:04,000
It's 22 chickens.
What about supplements?

3284
02:18:04,310 --> 02:18:07,460
That takes up my fish oil,
multivitamins,

3285
02:18:07,490 --> 02:18:10,480
omega,
omega six to three.

3286
02:18:11,210 --> 02:18:12,190
Yeah,
it took a lot of.

3287
02:18:12,190 --> 02:18:15,130
That is something that can go too far or
something like ray kurzweil it takes to.

3288
02:18:15,131 --> 02:18:16,930
Oh yeah,
supplements a day,

3289
02:18:17,110 --> 02:18:18,820
but he's just trying to stay alive and 
terrorist.

3290
02:18:18,821 --> 02:18:22,210
Sheens take right now.
I know I interviewed him for example,

3291
02:18:22,211 --> 02:18:23,044
he's kind of a girl.
He's almost like a secular guru because 

3292
02:18:26,261 --> 02:18:29,050
he's constructed this,
you know the second coming is coming,

3293
02:18:29,080 --> 02:18:30,220
the singularity,
it's 20,

3294
02:18:30,221 --> 02:18:30,911
30,
20,

3295
02:18:30,911 --> 02:18:32,260
41,
42.

3296
02:18:32,290 --> 02:18:35,680
If you could make it till the year 20,
47 or 2014.

3297
02:18:36,820 --> 02:18:37,653
I went to a conference in,
it was the same for the same show for 

3298
02:18:40,331 --> 02:18:41,300
um,
uh,

3299
02:18:41,500 --> 02:18:42,640
joe rogan questions,
everything.

3300
02:18:42,641 --> 02:18:45,160
We went to New York and they had this 
big conference.

3301
02:18:45,161 --> 02:18:46,180
I interviewed him and said,
oh,

3302
02:18:46,210 --> 02:18:47,820
the singularity summit.
Yeah.

3303
02:18:47,821 --> 02:18:50,500
Well I don't remember.
I think it was 20 slash 40 something.

3304
02:18:50,560 --> 02:18:51,760
Whatever the fuck it is,
20,

3305
02:18:51,761 --> 02:18:52,594
40.
They just pick a day when they think 

3306
02:18:54,371 --> 02:18:55,450
that it's all going to happen.

3307
02:18:55,480 --> 02:18:56,313
But they had this,
a russian billionaire character who 

3308
02:18:58,941 --> 02:19:03,340
would develop some artificial,
some thing that,

3309
02:19:03,430 --> 02:19:04,480
you know,
he was uh,

3310
02:19:04,520 --> 02:19:07,660
gonna unveil that was like a robot of 
him.

3311
02:19:08,100 --> 02:19:09,820
It's going to be an artificial 
intelligence,

3312
02:19:09,821 --> 02:19:11,280
but it wasn't ready,
you know,

3313
02:19:11,750 --> 02:19:14,890
say even if thAt will come eventually I 
think.

3314
02:19:14,891 --> 02:19:19,840
But even if they did accomplish that,
would it be you or just a copy of.

3315
02:19:19,841 --> 02:19:20,674
You see,
like when you go to sleep and you wake 

3316
02:19:22,601 --> 02:19:23,650
up,
you're a little groggy,

3317
02:19:23,651 --> 02:19:24,484
but there's a continuity.
It's still your memories and your 

3318
02:19:26,171 --> 02:19:28,460
personal life.
When you go under general anesthesia,

3319
02:19:28,461 --> 02:19:30,290
you're groggy after you wake up and it's
still,

3320
02:19:30,291 --> 02:19:33,710
there's a continuity,
but if they shut off your brain and turn

3321
02:19:33,711 --> 02:19:37,170
it back on inside a computer,
would you wake up and go,

3322
02:19:37,171 --> 02:19:37,460
oh,
well,

3323
02:19:37,460 --> 02:19:38,293
okay,
this is like waking up or would it just 

3324
02:19:39,411 --> 02:19:40,244
be you're gone and it's just a copy and 
this copy's just functioning completely 

3325
02:19:43,641 --> 02:19:44,474
on its own and it has no idea what it's 
doing because it's not connected to 

3326
02:19:47,811 --> 02:19:48,620
biology.

3327
02:19:48,620 --> 02:19:50,180
It's not connected to all the same.
it should,

3328
02:19:50,460 --> 02:19:51,293
you know,
maybe there's like a leap of faith they 

3329
02:19:52,281 --> 02:19:55,940
have to make before they hit the switch.
I'm not sure that that.

3330
02:19:56,120 --> 02:19:56,953
I think the problem of identity is a 
serious one for people in terms of 

3331
02:20:00,681 --> 02:20:01,514
longevity,
in terms of immortality will not only 

3332
02:20:02,961 --> 02:20:03,794
that.
How about the fact that if I can make 

3333
02:20:04,581 --> 02:20:05,540
one,
michael shermer,

3334
02:20:05,570 --> 02:20:10,570
if I can copy you have one or I just 
spam you when I spam you all over europe

3335
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:13,400
have a million.
Michael shermer is all throughout India.

3336
02:20:13,740 --> 02:20:15,350
That's,
that's a real problem,

3337
02:20:15,351 --> 02:20:15,861
right?
I mean,

3338
02:20:15,861 --> 02:20:16,694
if you can mAke a copy,
if you want to be immortal and you want 

3339
02:20:19,551 --> 02:20:20,384
a copy,
what's to stop someone from making 

3340
02:20:21,411 --> 02:20:25,120
multiple copies with you?
Stop Donald Trump and right?

3341
02:20:25,430 --> 02:20:26,390
Well,
so far nobody.

3342
02:20:26,391 --> 02:20:27,224
But if he wants to make a bunch of 
donald trump's maniac was just the 

3343
02:20:31,491 --> 02:20:34,520
moment you turn on the new copy,
uh,

3344
02:20:34,521 --> 02:20:35,354
they start having different memories 
because they're in a different 

3345
02:20:36,921 --> 02:20:39,830
environment than a different body and 
they're having different interactions.

3346
02:20:39,830 --> 02:20:40,663
And so if it's a bioLogical system,
then there's new neural connections 

3347
02:20:43,281 --> 02:20:46,310
growing that are different than yours 
than the joe rogan copy.

3348
02:20:46,750 --> 02:20:50,030
So that's no longer you,
you might have the same past memories,

3349
02:20:50,031 --> 02:20:52,220
but you're now going to have different.
Just like twins.

3350
02:20:52,270 --> 02:20:53,103
Yes.
Nobody thinks twins are identical in 

3351
02:20:55,351 --> 02:20:59,480
person in personhood illegally.
They're treated as separate entities.

3352
02:20:59,500 --> 02:21:01,490
And,
and of course that is right.

3353
02:21:01,491 --> 02:21:05,960
So I think that's really what,
what copies a ai copies will be.

3354
02:21:05,961 --> 02:21:08,480
It's just like twins.
That's a good point.

3355
02:21:08,600 --> 02:21:09,590
That's a good point.
Also,

3356
02:21:09,650 --> 02:21:10,483
the good point is from here on out,
you're going to have different life 

3357
02:21:12,441 --> 02:21:13,274
experiences.
So if you made it an exact duplicate of 

3358
02:21:15,201 --> 02:21:16,034
yourself at this day,
but one went to New York and the other 

3359
02:21:18,351 --> 02:21:21,350
one moved to miami,
you have totally different lives,

3360
02:21:21,351 --> 02:21:22,184
totally different experiences,
totally different blends going to be 

3361
02:21:23,661 --> 02:21:25,080
liberal,
one's going to be conservative,

3362
02:21:26,090 --> 02:21:26,923
you're going to make different 
conclusions based on your life 

3363
02:21:28,311 --> 02:21:29,144
experiences,
and that's just the reality of being a 

3364
02:21:30,951 --> 02:21:31,784
person is that we're constantly 
accumulating data and processing it and 

3365
02:21:35,451 --> 02:21:36,284
then also it's the environment that you 
surround yourself with as far as the 

3366
02:21:38,931 --> 02:21:41,750
unique individuals that you choose to 
associate with.

3367
02:21:41,780 --> 02:21:44,240
They flavor who you are so much.
RIght.

3368
02:21:44,300 --> 02:21:46,190
It's almost inseparable.
It's so.

3369
02:21:46,430 --> 02:21:47,263
It's so difficult to look at a person as
an individual because every individual 

3370
02:21:50,811 --> 02:21:53,900
is profoundly influenced by all the 
other people around them.

3371
02:21:53,990 --> 02:21:55,790
Right?
So you take this individual,

3372
02:21:55,791 --> 02:21:56,624
you move them to montreal and you 
surround them with a bunch of people 

3373
02:21:58,941 --> 02:22:01,250
that are totally different from them.
They learned french,

3374
02:22:01,251 --> 02:22:05,680
they started speaking with the quebecois
and next thing you know they're there.

3375
02:22:05,681 --> 02:22:07,430
It does a totally different human being.
Right?

3376
02:22:07,490 --> 02:22:10,370
You become different because of the 
People that you're around.

3377
02:22:10,400 --> 02:22:11,141
Exactly.
You know,

3378
02:22:11,141 --> 02:22:13,220
you don't even exist in a vacuum,
right?

3379
02:22:13,221 --> 02:22:15,450
So,
so in terms of like trying to achieve in

3380
02:22:15,451 --> 02:22:16,284
mortality,
like the military ones or the 

3381
02:22:17,550 --> 02:22:19,650
transhumanists,
um,

3382
02:22:19,730 --> 02:22:22,100
or the extropians,
they're against entropy.

3383
02:22:22,670 --> 02:22:23,760
Oh really?
Oh yeah.

3384
02:22:24,280 --> 02:22:26,040
What's their theory?
It's a little bit

3385
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:26,873
like the transhumanist that we're going 
to slowly replace our body parts and in 

3386
02:22:31,260 --> 02:22:32,850
now,
not just new joints,

3387
02:22:32,880 --> 02:22:33,713
but you know,
if you would replace your nerve cells 

3388
02:22:35,600 --> 02:22:38,580
and as long as you still have to have 
the continuity,

3389
02:22:38,581 --> 02:22:39,414
it's still you as a person in there.
I'm just uploading it to another 

3390
02:22:43,321 --> 02:22:44,630
platform.
Is,

3391
02:22:44,740 --> 02:22:46,290
is.
I don't think it's going to do it.

3392
02:22:46,291 --> 02:22:49,980
I think it's not you anymore.
The johnny depp inside the computer.

3393
02:22:50,250 --> 02:22:51,780
Turn it on.
Transcendence theory is.

3394
02:22:51,840 --> 02:22:55,470
I don't think that can happen right now.
I may be wrong.

3395
02:22:55,471 --> 02:22:58,590
There are people that do think this can 
happen but doesn't have to be you.

3396
02:22:58,610 --> 02:23:02,420
Can it be like something you,
you personally one,

3397
02:23:02,510 --> 02:23:04,170
right?
It'S like woody allen said,

3398
02:23:04,171 --> 02:23:06,480
I don't want to live on through my work 
I want to live on,

3399
02:23:06,481 --> 02:23:08,080
in my apartment.
Uh,

3400
02:23:08,210 --> 02:23:11,960
somebody said one of his many lines 
about immortality.

3401
02:23:12,340 --> 02:23:14,110
Yes.
Um,

3402
02:23:14,580 --> 02:23:16,890
you inside the computer,
the copy of you,

3403
02:23:17,350 --> 02:23:19,650
a copy of you is just the extension of 
your work,

3404
02:23:19,780 --> 02:23:20,310
you know,
it's like,

3405
02:23:20,310 --> 02:23:22,620
this is a little bit of a copy of me,
my books and so on,

3406
02:23:22,621 --> 02:23:23,790
but it's not me.
Right.

3407
02:23:24,040 --> 02:23:26,100
and after I'm gone,
the books are still around,

3408
02:23:26,101 --> 02:23:29,430
but it's not really me.
I don't feel like I'm still going.

3409
02:23:29,770 --> 02:23:32,850
Isn't there a problem with,
if you believe in evolution,

3410
02:23:32,880 --> 02:23:33,713
which I assume you do and you,
you assume that people are going to 

3411
02:23:36,871 --> 02:23:41,490
continue to change shape,
we're going to continue.

3412
02:23:41,491 --> 02:23:42,324
I mean if we used to be multicell 
organisms that are coming out of the 

3413
02:23:44,671 --> 02:23:48,360
muck,
the primordial ooze and now were people,

3414
02:23:48,840 --> 02:23:49,673
what,
what are we going to be a million years 

3415
02:23:50,611 --> 02:23:51,444
from now?
are we going to stifle that and just 

3416
02:23:52,921 --> 02:23:56,160
lock ourselves into this form?
This is not a perfect form.

3417
02:23:57,110 --> 02:23:57,943
One of the arguments is that we should,
we should take over evolution and we 

3418
02:24:00,481 --> 02:24:02,580
are.
so genetic engineering for examPle,

3419
02:24:02,610 --> 02:24:04,420
right now everybody's afraid of,
oh,

3420
02:24:04,421 --> 02:24:05,640
they're going to make ariens or 
whatever.

3421
02:24:05,780 --> 02:24:06,810
Okay,
let's just,

3422
02:24:06,870 --> 02:24:09,480
let's just allow it to happen to solve 
alzheimer's,

3423
02:24:09,510 --> 02:24:11,040
cure cancer,
things like that.

3424
02:24:11,550 --> 02:24:13,600
Then we can worry about uploading,
you know,

3425
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:15,800
more intelligence into our cortex.
Say for,

3426
02:24:15,850 --> 02:24:18,330
for what if we do to people what we've 
done to tomatoes,

3427
02:24:18,400 --> 02:24:20,240
make them boring and flavor,
flavor,

3428
02:24:20,390 --> 02:24:22,740
flavor to last longer.
That could happen.

3429
02:24:23,940 --> 02:24:27,090
that's actually a good point.
People,

3430
02:24:27,091 --> 02:24:29,700
we did tomatoes,
we fucked up tomatoes,

3431
02:24:29,701 --> 02:24:30,780
but they last forever.
Well,

3432
02:24:31,150 --> 02:24:33,990
in a way with international travel in 
the internet now,

3433
02:24:33,991 --> 02:24:37,140
you know the poorest borders in 
centuries or so,

3434
02:24:37,580 --> 02:24:38,413
you know,
everyone will look like tiger woods or 

3435
02:24:39,181 --> 02:24:40,130
something like this,
you know,

3436
02:24:41,130 --> 02:24:44,040
I think the racial barriers will 
eventually dissolved.

3437
02:24:44,040 --> 02:24:45,930
Well then we'll find some new way to 
hate each other.

3438
02:24:46,070 --> 02:24:47,070
Oh,
absolutely.

3439
02:24:47,071 --> 02:24:48,540
You know,
humans are super good at that,

3440
02:24:49,390 --> 02:24:53,760
but if we colonize another planet,
say we started colony on mars in,

3441
02:24:53,770 --> 02:24:57,870
in a way that's a founder population 
that can then begin to diverge away from

3442
02:24:58,260 --> 02:25:02,250
the earthly population and in a million 
years you'd have two different species.

3443
02:25:02,251 --> 02:25:03,084
Say they could maybe,
well they'd probably still be able to 

3444
02:25:05,941 --> 02:25:08,100
integrate because there's still 
connections.

3445
02:25:08,430 --> 02:25:09,263
You'd also have a movable men that 
you've got a whole civilization to 

3446
02:25:11,171 --> 02:25:13,890
people so fucking crazy.
They decided to move to mars.

3447
02:25:14,790 --> 02:25:16,310
It's a self selecting group.
They're probably.

3448
02:25:16,730 --> 02:25:18,930
They're probably not typical.
Definitely not.

3449
02:25:18,931 --> 02:25:19,764
I mean,
and they're also going to have to do 

3450
02:25:21,091 --> 02:25:24,450
some crazy geoengineering and we're 
going to have to hope that that keeps it

3451
02:25:25,170 --> 02:25:26,003
fun.
Scenario would be what kind of 

3452
02:25:26,710 --> 02:25:27,543
government would they set up?
What kind of economic system and 

3453
02:25:30,010 --> 02:25:31,960
assuming they were,
none of them were religious.

3454
02:25:32,020 --> 02:25:33,880
If he came back a thousand years from 
now,

3455
02:25:33,881 --> 02:25:37,870
would they have a shrine to a god and 
religion and all this.

3456
02:25:38,260 --> 02:25:42,920
It happened again and then we'd have the
history archetype a.

3457
02:25:42,940 --> 02:25:44,950
It'd be interesting.
It's one of the interesting things about

3458
02:25:44,951 --> 02:25:45,784
scientology in the mormon church is that
we have a clear recent history and a 

3459
02:25:49,330 --> 02:25:51,670
paper trail to see what happened.
Videos,

3460
02:25:51,970 --> 02:25:52,803
but we don't have,
but we don't have for christianity is 

3461
02:25:55,121 --> 02:25:55,954
that it's old enough that it's lost in 
the murkiness of time and it so you can 

3462
02:25:59,351 --> 02:26:02,230
kind of fill in the blanks with miracles
and things like that.

3463
02:26:02,650 --> 02:26:03,483
Here we know Joseph Smith was killed and
then brigham young move to Utah to get 

3464
02:26:06,551 --> 02:26:07,384
away from the authorities and you know,
and we know exactly how it all unfolded 

3465
02:26:11,111 --> 02:26:13,870
and so you can diagram how to start a 
religion.

3466
02:26:13,900 --> 02:26:14,733
well,
you know the whole mitt romney story 

3467
02:26:15,581 --> 02:26:17,050
too,
but his family in Mexico,

3468
02:26:17,051 --> 02:26:17,350
right?

3469
02:26:17,350 --> 02:26:18,310
Oh right,
that's right.

3470
02:26:18,311 --> 02:26:19,270
Yes,
I forgot about that.

3471
02:26:19,271 --> 02:26:20,104
Yeah,
I'll move to Mexico when they couldn't 

3472
02:26:20,951 --> 02:26:22,290
have 100 wives.
Right.

3473
02:26:22,370 --> 02:26:23,081
Like,
fuck this.

3474
02:26:23,081 --> 02:26:23,914
We're out of America.
Swears his dad bringing me on was 

3475
02:26:26,381 --> 02:26:28,570
originally against polygamy until.
Yeah,

3476
02:26:28,571 --> 02:26:30,250
until he tried it and then he's like,
oh,

3477
02:26:31,360 --> 02:26:32,193
well,
one of my favorite books is john 

3478
02:26:35,290 --> 02:26:37,930
krakauer is under the banner of heaven.
He's a great writer,

3479
02:26:38,560 --> 02:26:39,393
but he has a.
He kind of reconstructs the moment when 

3480
02:26:40,841 --> 02:26:41,674
Joseph Smith tells his wife emma that he
got this revelation from god about 

3481
02:26:45,251 --> 02:26:47,440
polygamy.
Celestial marriage.

3482
02:26:47,441 --> 02:26:48,274
He called it and it basically is already
having an affair with this woman down 

3483
02:26:50,501 --> 02:26:51,730
the street.
So basically he goes,

3484
02:26:51,760 --> 02:26:53,000
well honey,
you know,

3485
02:26:53,020 --> 02:26:58,020
I was talking to god and he told me that
I'm supposed to have sex with so and so.

3486
02:26:59,170 --> 02:27:01,270
I know I couldn't believe it either,
but my friends,

3487
02:27:01,271 --> 02:27:01,900
they were all there.

3488
02:27:01,900 --> 02:27:04,660
They heard it too.
They're telling their wives right now.

3489
02:27:04,790 --> 02:27:07,090
Oh.
So ama says something like,

3490
02:27:07,300 --> 02:27:08,133
well,
in that case I'm going to have a extra 

3491
02:27:09,221 --> 02:27:10,054
husbands.
He said,

3492
02:27:10,510 --> 02:27:12,550
now you know,
god was really clear about this.

3493
02:27:12,551 --> 02:27:17,551
It's just for the guys as this gets sold
as a viable,

3494
02:27:17,810 --> 02:27:19,870
a declaration of,
of,

3495
02:27:19,930 --> 02:27:21,820
of revelations.
And it's written down.

3496
02:27:22,210 --> 02:27:25,060
So if you look at the first page of the 
book of mormon,

3497
02:27:25,061 --> 02:27:26,240
it's an affidavit,
you know,

3498
02:27:26,241 --> 02:27:28,570
we are the people.
We saw the gold tablets and so on.

3499
02:27:28,840 --> 02:27:32,340
Same thing with the revelation about 
polygamy all the way until 18,

3500
02:27:32,350 --> 02:27:35,140
94 when the state of Utah wanted to 
become a state.

3501
02:27:35,141 --> 02:27:37,660
And the federal government said not with
polygamy.

3502
02:27:38,410 --> 02:27:39,243
And suddenly they got a new revelation 
from god changed my mind about the 

3503
02:27:41,651 --> 02:27:44,230
polygamy thing back to monogamy.
Oh,

3504
02:27:44,240 --> 02:27:45,071
okay,
okay.

3505
02:27:45,071 --> 02:27:47,140
It could be a state,
not mitt romney's parents.

3506
02:27:47,140 --> 02:27:48,190
They're like,
we're out of here.

3507
02:27:48,700 --> 02:27:49,690
So you go to the fringes.
Well,

3508
02:27:49,691 --> 02:27:51,670
Colorado city and that was in the news 
yesterday.

3509
02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:55,000
Um,
apparently the whole police force,

3510
02:27:55,001 --> 02:27:55,834
the courts,
everybody that lives in this town is 

3511
02:27:57,671 --> 02:27:59,770
fundamentalist mormon.
They're polygamous fan.

3512
02:28:00,040 --> 02:28:01,200
So you,
Colorado cities.

3513
02:28:01,460 --> 02:28:03,460
That's right on the border of Utah and 
Arizona,

3514
02:28:04,270 --> 02:28:05,510
Colorado city,
Arizona.

3515
02:28:05,520 --> 02:28:06,970
I think art,
maybe it's in Utah,

3516
02:28:06,971 --> 02:28:11,130
it's right on that road that goes to 
kayak and um,

3517
02:28:11,410 --> 02:28:13,420
and we've been there.
We race across America.

3518
02:28:13,421 --> 02:28:15,610
used to go through on a route to get to 
New York.

3519
02:28:15,611 --> 02:28:18,160
We'd go through northern Arizona in 
southern Colorado.

3520
02:28:18,250 --> 02:28:20,550
Did they tell you?
And it's a,

3521
02:28:20,560 --> 02:28:22,050
it's a community.
You

3522
02:28:22,050 --> 02:28:25,620
drive through there and people are 
looking at you and it's like,

3523
02:28:25,740 --> 02:28:28,360
it's like being in a twilight zone or 
spiles episode,

3524
02:28:28,361 --> 02:28:29,420
you know,
where they drive somewhere.

3525
02:28:29,430 --> 02:28:33,140
It's like everybody's a little weird and
you can see the dress.

3526
02:28:33,170 --> 02:28:36,200
Clothing is like,
everything is off a little bit.

3527
02:28:36,201 --> 02:28:38,330
Even like at the gas station,
at the denny's,

3528
02:28:38,331 --> 02:28:40,520
it's like there's something not quite 
right here.

3529
02:28:40,610 --> 02:28:41,950
That's awesome.
I want to go.

3530
02:28:42,050 --> 02:28:43,790
Oh,
it's right now.

3531
02:28:44,570 --> 02:28:45,420
It's really a.
Yeah.

3532
02:28:45,450 --> 02:28:47,480
I don't think the polygamy should be 
illegal.

3533
02:28:47,600 --> 02:28:50,180
I really don't because it's not illegal 
to live with 20 women.

3534
02:28:50,420 --> 02:28:51,253
If you just you who hugh hefner it and 
you decided to have like 20 women live 

3535
02:28:54,321 --> 02:28:55,430
with you,
you're a king,

3536
02:28:55,550 --> 02:28:58,400
you know,
but if you signed paperwork with them,

3537
02:28:58,550 --> 02:29:00,380
then all of a sudden it's a problem.
Well,

3538
02:29:00,381 --> 02:29:01,214
the way they do it as they marry one of 
them legally and then the rest are so 

3539
02:29:03,800 --> 02:29:04,633
called sister wives and they're not 
actually married to them so they're not 

3540
02:29:07,041 --> 02:29:10,070
breaking the law and there's no law 
against having,

3541
02:29:10,071 --> 02:29:11,660
you know,
living with a bunch of women.

3542
02:29:11,660 --> 02:29:14,630
It's okay,
well the law only exists in terms of all

3543
02:29:14,631 --> 02:29:18,020
the other people outside of their 
community or their neighborhood or their

3544
02:29:18,021 --> 02:29:22,070
family recognizing it and it's just a 
problem with if every.

3545
02:29:22,110 --> 02:29:25,040
If you have a law that says this,
but everybody in the town,

3546
02:29:25,820 --> 02:29:28,610
including the police captain,
the courts,

3547
02:29:28,730 --> 02:29:30,500
well the judge,
they're all in on it.

3548
02:29:30,560 --> 02:29:31,393
They're all in it.
So now I have conflicting feelings 

3549
02:29:34,341 --> 02:29:38,120
about,
about my libertarian tendencies.

3550
02:29:38,121 --> 02:29:38,810
We go,
well,

3551
02:29:38,810 --> 02:29:40,340
adult people should do whatever they 
want,

3552
02:29:40,370 --> 02:29:42,950
but why is the government in the 
marriage business in the first place?

3553
02:29:43,010 --> 02:29:43,843
I agree,
but the problem is when you study the 

3554
02:29:45,681 --> 02:29:47,280
polygamous mormons,
you know they.

3555
02:29:47,330 --> 02:29:49,130
These,
these are young girls,

3556
02:29:49,131 --> 02:29:50,120
this warren jeffs,
jessica.

3557
02:29:50,121 --> 02:29:53,450
He was marrying twelve-year-olds.
He was having sex with 11 year olds.

3558
02:29:53,720 --> 02:29:54,980
Okay.
There is a proBlem.

3559
02:29:55,010 --> 02:29:56,360
That's absolutely a problem.
Yeah.

3560
02:29:56,361 --> 02:29:59,990
Well that's just a problem period with 
someone who's a grown adult who's having

3561
02:29:59,991 --> 02:30:00,950
sex with a young kid.

3562
02:30:01,010 --> 02:30:03,980
That's obviously that goes without 
saying,

3563
02:30:04,280 --> 02:30:06,710
but as long as the person's 21 or 
whatever,

3564
02:30:06,711 --> 02:30:07,544
I mean,
I really think he should probably be 21 

3565
02:30:08,481 --> 02:30:10,290
before you even allowed to get married.
I mean,

3566
02:30:10,490 --> 02:30:12,260
I probably would have got married if I 
was 18.

3567
02:30:12,530 --> 02:30:14,240
My girlfriend when I was 18 at the time 
said,

3568
02:30:14,241 --> 02:30:15,440
marry me.
I'm breaking up with you.

3569
02:30:15,441 --> 02:30:16,380
I'd be like,
fuck it.

3570
02:30:16,530 --> 02:30:17,363
Let's do it.
Yeah.

3571
02:30:17,880 --> 02:30:18,880
Yeah.
I was lost.

3572
02:30:18,910 --> 02:30:19,970
Yeah,
you're too young.

3573
02:30:19,971 --> 02:30:23,810
You don't have enough information to be 
allowed to do anything until they're 30.

3574
02:30:24,290 --> 02:30:25,123
Probably not even might be fortunate,
but the idea that you could tell some 

3575
02:30:29,780 --> 02:30:33,950
adult that they can't sign a piece of 
paper with another adult.

3576
02:30:34,260 --> 02:30:35,570
Yeah.
I mean,

3577
02:30:35,720 --> 02:30:38,600
it's just as preposterous to say the 
same sex marriage should be illegal,

3578
02:30:38,700 --> 02:30:39,533
right?
Why not?

3579
02:30:39,980 --> 02:30:40,813
Who cares?
As long as they're not brainwashed when 

3580
02:30:43,251 --> 02:30:44,990
they're little that they should be.

3581
02:30:45,240 --> 02:30:48,110
Yes,
because then maybe you're 21.

3582
02:30:48,590 --> 02:30:52,890
Are you really making a rational choice 
about your future or are you there?

3583
02:30:53,270 --> 02:30:55,730
That becomes a problem with cults and 
that's also the problem,

3584
02:30:56,430 --> 02:30:57,590
and then it becomes,
okay,

3585
02:30:57,591 --> 02:30:59,210
well where's the line?
Get gray.

3586
02:30:59,240 --> 02:31:01,310
Okay,
if a mormon can't do it,

3587
02:31:01,340 --> 02:31:03,770
if you can't take someone when they're 
really young,

3588
02:31:03,771 --> 02:31:07,490
raise them as a mormon and then wants to
become of age and they become an adult.

3589
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:08,593
Tell them now you can get married and 
you can be involved in this polygamous 

3590
02:31:12,411 --> 02:31:15,290
marriage and well,
they grew up in this religion.

3591
02:31:15,320 --> 02:31:17,990
Are they brainwash even though they're 
are grown adult?

3592
02:31:18,290 --> 02:31:19,290
Well,
if that's the case,

3593
02:31:19,630 --> 02:31:20,070
but what

3594
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:20,903
about alice ism or whatever and you go,
it's the government can't be in the 

3595
02:31:24,001 --> 02:31:26,670
business of judging that.
so it's a,

3596
02:31:26,671 --> 02:31:27,350
it's a,
you know,

3597
02:31:27,350 --> 02:31:29,910
it's a fine line there.
It's tough when you put your hand on the

3598
02:31:29,911 --> 02:31:32,430
bible when you swear to be in a fucking 
president.

3599
02:31:32,431 --> 02:31:33,264
Right?
Hilarious weakens bible it still 

3600
02:31:35,431 --> 02:31:36,420
lincoln's bible.
Well,

3601
02:31:36,421 --> 02:31:38,580
that's who obama used was the lincoln's 
bible.

3602
02:31:38,581 --> 02:31:39,414
Yeah.
No,

3603
02:31:39,470 --> 02:31:40,303
I am i.
Am I remembering that was at martin 

3604
02:31:42,571 --> 02:31:43,950
luther king's bible?
No,

3605
02:31:43,951 --> 02:31:45,630
I think it was.
Mlk is bible.

3606
02:31:45,631 --> 02:31:46,890
Yeah.
Anyway.

3607
02:31:46,891 --> 02:31:47,461
Yeah.
So,

3608
02:31:47,461 --> 02:31:49,100
but yeah,
that's very telematic.

3609
02:31:49,900 --> 02:31:52,620
We're touching the past.
So dumb as if,

3610
02:31:52,650 --> 02:31:53,483
you know,
the old testament is a font of moral 

3611
02:31:55,081 --> 02:31:57,270
wisdom.
Is it the old testament they use?

3612
02:31:57,540 --> 02:31:58,680
Well,
the whole thing,

3613
02:31:59,220 --> 02:32:00,053
but is it the new testament,
the old testament that he puts his hand 

3614
02:32:01,681 --> 02:32:02,441
on?
It's both.

3615
02:32:02,441 --> 02:32:05,790
It's the bible that includes both that 
polygamy was,

3616
02:32:05,791 --> 02:32:07,170
you know,
all the great patriarchs.

3617
02:32:07,170 --> 02:32:12,140
There was a study by Helen Fisher now.
It was a different anthropologist on um,

3618
02:32:12,920 --> 02:32:13,753
uh,
the relationshiP between power and sex 

3619
02:32:15,811 --> 02:32:16,644
in the old testament and basically the 
more power you had more women and wives 

3620
02:32:20,311 --> 02:32:22,590
and girlfriends and concubines and 
children you had,

3621
02:32:22,620 --> 02:32:25,020
how unusual.
And solomon was the,

3622
02:32:25,021 --> 02:32:25,854
you know,
he was going for wilt chamberlains 

3623
02:32:26,461 --> 02:32:28,710
record there.
He had 700 wives,

3624
02:32:28,711 --> 02:32:30,540
300 concubines,
and you know,

3625
02:32:30,870 --> 02:32:32,640
thousands of kids,
I guess.

3626
02:32:32,990 --> 02:32:34,560
Well,
allegedly,

3627
02:32:34,650 --> 02:32:35,690
allegedly,
but I mean,

3628
02:32:35,691 --> 02:32:36,301
it wasn't,
no,

3629
02:32:36,301 --> 02:32:37,410
uh,
600 years old.

3630
02:32:37,411 --> 02:32:38,910
So it's hard,
right?

3631
02:32:39,180 --> 02:32:40,013
I mean,
most of the stuff probably didn't 

3632
02:32:40,741 --> 02:32:43,620
actually happen in the old testament.
Probably moses never existed,

3633
02:32:43,860 --> 02:32:47,070
but the point is that,
that is the way men treated women,

3634
02:32:47,071 --> 02:32:47,904
that,
that was the patriarchal society at the 

3635
02:32:49,201 --> 02:32:50,670
time.
Slavery was legal,

3636
02:32:50,671 --> 02:32:53,700
polygamy was legal.
The more power you had,

3637
02:32:53,701 --> 02:32:55,920
the more wealth you had,
the more women you have,

3638
02:32:55,921 --> 02:32:57,630
the more children you had it.

3639
02:32:57,890 --> 02:33:01,130
That was the world of the old testament,
you know,

3640
02:33:01,140 --> 02:33:04,890
and that's not the world we live in now.
So why are we still using this book?

3641
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:05,970
Yeah,
exactly.

3642
02:33:06,030 --> 02:33:06,570
I mean,
it's,

3643
02:33:06,570 --> 02:33:07,740
nobody would embrace,
you know,

3644
02:33:07,741 --> 02:33:11,070
christian today,
I would embrace most of the stuff that's

3645
02:33:11,071 --> 02:33:12,270
in the bible.
They just wouldn't.

3646
02:33:12,271 --> 02:33:14,220
So when they say I get my morals from 
the bible,

3647
02:33:14,221 --> 02:33:14,730
it's like,
no,

3648
02:33:14,730 --> 02:33:15,563
no,
you don't.

3649
02:33:15,600 --> 02:33:18,420
And that's a good thing.
You're getting your morals from the same

3650
02:33:18,421 --> 02:33:20,040
place.
We nonbelievers get it.

3651
02:33:20,090 --> 02:33:21,150
Uh,
and you know,

3652
02:33:21,151 --> 02:33:25,410
we were inculcating it from culture,
from the enlightenment secular values.

3653
02:33:25,470 --> 02:33:26,303
Well,
I'm glaD you brought that up because 

3654
02:33:26,611 --> 02:33:29,910
that was an article that I've read that 
you had written about islam,

3655
02:33:29,940 --> 02:33:33,370
that islam was the only religion that 
had not gone through the advertisement.

3656
02:33:33,400 --> 02:33:34,040
Right?
Yeah.

3657
02:33:34,040 --> 02:33:34,873
I think that was a really,
really interesting article and a very 

3658
02:33:36,451 --> 02:33:37,284
important point.

3659
02:33:37,380 --> 02:33:38,340
You know what I mean?
Christianity,

3660
02:33:38,341 --> 02:33:40,470
they used to be head jews,
uh,

3661
02:33:40,471 --> 02:33:42,770
and witches were burned at the stake,
you know,

3662
02:33:42,790 --> 02:33:44,520
I mean the kinds of stuff isis does 
today.

3663
02:33:44,521 --> 02:33:46,190
Christians used to do that centuries 
ago.

3664
02:33:46,200 --> 02:33:49,500
It's very common and they stopped.
Why?

3665
02:33:49,590 --> 02:33:51,050
Well,
the law changed.

3666
02:33:51,051 --> 02:33:51,884
That culture changed and the 
enlightenment era ushered in secular 

3667
02:33:55,501 --> 02:33:56,334
values that all people should be treated
equally under the law that people are 

3668
02:33:58,741 --> 02:34:00,960
born with equal rights and,
and,

3669
02:34:00,980 --> 02:34:02,160
and,
and so forth.

3670
02:34:02,180 --> 02:34:03,013
And,
and that all changed everything and 

3671
02:34:05,131 --> 02:34:06,930
everybody is incorporate.
Just thinking about,

3672
02:34:07,010 --> 02:34:10,450
I'm a member when the owners,
a former owner,

3673
02:34:10,480 --> 02:34:13,110
the clippers,
donald sterling made these remarks,

3674
02:34:13,460 --> 02:34:16,380
you know,
but most old guys thought like that just

3675
02:34:16,381 --> 02:34:18,430
50 years ago and weren't particularly.

3676
02:34:19,330 --> 02:34:22,390
His remarks were pretty,
pretty innocuous.

3677
02:34:22,450 --> 02:34:24,400
What he has said,
he had a girlfriend,

3678
02:34:24,430 --> 02:34:25,263
this is,
this thing has been blown out of 

3679
02:34:26,021 --> 02:34:26,854
proportion so bad and yet he had a 
girlfriend and he asked her not to take 

3680
02:34:31,181 --> 02:34:33,850
pictures with these guys.
These black guys.

3681
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,910
He said in the same sentence,
you can fuck them.

3682
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,700
I don't care if you fuck them,
just don't take pictures with them.

3683
02:34:39,730 --> 02:34:40,720
It was already said.
Yeah,

3684
02:34:41,190 --> 02:34:43,360
they need to clear that part.
Print any of that.

3685
02:34:43,361 --> 02:34:44,194
Right.
And everybody was talking about the the 

3686
02:34:45,890 --> 02:34:46,723
don't take pictures of the black eyes.
He said he knew what he was saying was 

3687
02:34:49,991 --> 02:34:52,480
that you're sticking it in my face that 
you're fucking on these guys.

3688
02:34:52,650 --> 02:34:54,490
I don't care if you fuck them.
Just don't take pictures of.

3689
02:34:54,750 --> 02:34:55,680
I don't want to see it.
Right.

3690
02:34:55,790 --> 02:34:59,470
Saying this to his girlfriend in the 
privacy of his house.

3691
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:02,920
He didn't use any racial slurs.
He didn't say anything terrible.

3692
02:35:02,950 --> 02:35:03,783
All he said was,
don't take pictures of these guys 

3693
02:35:05,650 --> 02:35:08,470
because she was a slow.
Allegedly,

3694
02:35:08,860 --> 02:35:09,693
she's banging a bunch of dudes and he 
didn't care because he's like 80 years 

3695
02:35:11,801 --> 02:35:12,634
old.
He's like buying or condos and rolls 

3696
02:35:14,171 --> 02:35:15,220
royces and shit.
He just,

3697
02:35:15,370 --> 02:35:17,110
he just wants to keep banging her 
because she's hot,

3698
02:35:17,170 --> 02:35:18,040
right?
So he's like,

3699
02:35:18,041 --> 02:35:21,300
I don't care for him.
Look,

3700
02:35:21,320 --> 02:35:23,560
you're still have higher standards.
That guy's,

3701
02:35:23,830 --> 02:35:25,390
he looks like jabba the hutt.
He's like,

3702
02:35:25,391 --> 02:35:27,140
his face has fallen off his bones.
Right.

3703
02:35:27,540 --> 02:35:31,330
So for that poor guy,
I mean that last him,

3704
02:35:31,360 --> 02:35:32,530
his,
his team,

3705
02:35:32,800 --> 02:35:35,200
which is insane.
But it shows you how far we've come.

3706
02:35:35,201 --> 02:35:36,130
And again,
most people,

3707
02:35:36,131 --> 02:35:36,964
most old guys in the fifties would have 
thought nothing about saying that 

3708
02:35:39,310 --> 02:35:40,150
publicly.
Yeah.

3709
02:35:40,151 --> 02:35:40,984
But apparently he was pretty racist and 
that what they caught him with a small 

3710
02:35:45,941 --> 02:35:48,160
little slice of what he had done.

3711
02:35:48,310 --> 02:35:50,510
This is obviously allegedly blah blah 
blah.

3712
02:35:50,860 --> 02:35:51,693
But apparently it wasn't a nice guy,
which is why this was so reinforced and 

3713
02:35:55,330 --> 02:35:57,360
why people went after him so hard.
They're like,

3714
02:35:57,370 --> 02:35:58,203
look,
we got him which has run with this and 

3715
02:35:59,411 --> 02:36:03,070
obviously it's a pr nightmare,
but yeah,

3716
02:36:03,071 --> 02:36:05,890
people evolve.
And I think now in today's day and age,

3717
02:36:05,920 --> 02:36:10,920
that kind of thinking like racist 
thinking justifiably so is gross.

3718
02:36:12,400 --> 02:36:15,880
It's frowned upon absolute learning we 
are learning yet.

3719
02:36:15,950 --> 02:36:17,230
Yeah.
So I mean the moral arc,

3720
02:36:17,231 --> 02:36:18,740
that's what that's about tracking,
you know,

3721
02:36:18,760 --> 02:36:20,950
how much moral progress we've made over 
the centuries,

3722
02:36:20,980 --> 02:36:24,130
particularly just the last 50 years and 
the civil rights movement.

3723
02:36:24,340 --> 02:36:27,070
It's one reason why I think all these 
campus protests,

3724
02:36:27,071 --> 02:36:27,904
I've gotten so out of hand there so 
disproportionate because the students 

3725
02:36:30,581 --> 02:36:31,414
have a moral,
a module there still passionate about 

3726
02:36:34,210 --> 02:36:37,930
making the world a better place,
but all the big stuff's been taken.

3727
02:36:38,020 --> 02:36:40,990
It's all done.
Did it down to halloween costumes,

3728
02:36:41,020 --> 02:36:44,200
taco tuesdays,
he wore a sombrero.

3729
02:36:44,470 --> 02:36:45,710
Cultural appropriate,
you know,

3730
02:36:46,070 --> 02:36:50,020
they're all fired up about what they 
view it as just like safe spaces.

3731
02:36:50,021 --> 02:36:51,520
That's where ideas go to die.
I mean,

3732
02:36:51,521 --> 02:36:52,354
come on.
It's safe spaces such such a stupid 

3733
02:36:54,011 --> 02:36:57,290
argument.
Any argument that's worth it,

3734
02:36:57,300 --> 02:36:58,133
it has to stand on its own merits.
You have to be able to discuss things 

3735
02:37:00,641 --> 02:37:03,550
like having a university where you can't
discuss ideas,

3736
02:37:03,950 --> 02:37:07,390
would even even bad ideas.
Bad ideas should be debated.

3737
02:37:08,050 --> 02:37:12,850
The idea that they won't let these 
conservatives perform or speeches at the

3738
02:37:12,851 --> 02:37:15,040
universities and they tried to shut them
down,

3739
02:37:15,140 --> 02:37:16,280
scream at people.
They.

3740
02:37:16,281 --> 02:37:18,560
They hit fire alarms.
I mean,

3741
02:37:18,561 --> 02:37:19,740
it's madness.
It's,

3742
02:37:19,810 --> 02:37:20,643
it's everything that you're not supposed
to do when you're defending and 

3743
02:37:22,701 --> 02:37:24,710
exploring ideas.
I think the deeper,

3744
02:37:24,711 --> 02:37:25,544
the deepest cause of this is,
is the asymmetry between left and right 

3745
02:37:29,991 --> 02:37:31,100
on,
in the academy?

3746
02:37:31,130 --> 02:37:34,070
Yes.
It's in some of these departments.

3747
02:37:34,071 --> 02:37:38,150
It's 20 to one,
a liberal conservative democrat,

3748
02:37:38,151 --> 02:37:39,410
republican,
uh,

3749
02:37:39,440 --> 02:37:41,750
only in the economics department.
The social sciences.

3750
02:37:41,751 --> 02:37:44,720
do you get something like a balance 
everywhere else it's super slanted.

3751
02:37:45,260 --> 02:37:46,240
And uh,
so you're,

3752
02:37:46,260 --> 02:37:47,540
you're,
you're getting this added.

3753
02:37:47,570 --> 02:37:49,210
Well,
we know what the truth is.

3754
02:37:49,211 --> 02:37:50,044
Well,
maybe you don't know what the truth is 

3755
02:37:51,321 --> 02:37:52,154
and you need to listen to the other side
because that's what has driven science 

3756
02:37:55,551 --> 02:37:56,384
and reason and the enlightenment is,
is open open debate because I might not 

3757
02:37:59,961 --> 02:38:00,794
be right.
And so the only way to find out is if I 

3758
02:38:02,151 --> 02:38:05,360
ask you your opinion.
And so I tell my students,

3759
02:38:05,361 --> 02:38:06,290
you know,
you gotta,

3760
02:38:06,291 --> 02:38:08,690
you gotta read the wall street journal 
in addition to the New York times,

3761
02:38:08,691 --> 02:38:10,390
you got to listen to,
you know,

3762
02:38:10,430 --> 02:38:13,880
conservative talk radio in addition to 
npr and you gotta you gotta hear it,

3763
02:38:13,881 --> 02:38:15,320
you know,
he listened to rush limbaugh.

3764
02:38:15,380 --> 02:38:16,213
Oh god,
I know he's a knuckle dragging a mouth 

3765
02:38:17,331 --> 02:38:18,164
breather.
But somebody on that side just to see 

3766
02:38:20,570 --> 02:38:23,580
what listening to larry elder there.
I like larry elder.

3767
02:38:23,581 --> 02:38:25,130
Yeah,
he's a conservative,

3768
02:38:25,131 --> 02:38:27,350
but he's a little bit more rational.
Lot more,

3769
02:38:27,400 --> 02:38:32,000
little more libertarian arguments are 
interesting.

3770
02:38:32,260 --> 02:38:33,093
Yeah.
And the only way to know what the other 

3771
02:38:34,371 --> 02:38:37,280
side really thinks because you think,
well why do they believe that?

3772
02:38:37,310 --> 02:38:40,100
Well,
you have to listen to their arguments to

3773
02:38:40,101 --> 02:38:42,050
at least be able to articulate why 
they're wrong.

3774
02:38:42,180 --> 02:38:43,013
If you can't do that,
then you really don't know why they're 

3775
02:38:44,301 --> 02:38:45,320
wrong.
Exactly.

3776
02:38:45,350 --> 02:38:46,760
Yeah.
And find,

3777
02:38:47,200 --> 02:38:48,033
try to like balance,
like look at things through their 

3778
02:38:50,391 --> 02:38:51,224
perspective.
Even if you don't agree with their 

3779
02:38:51,861 --> 02:38:53,750
perspective,
just relax yourself,

3780
02:38:53,780 --> 02:38:54,613
relax yourself and allow you.
Allow yourself To explore the way they 

3781
02:38:57,681 --> 02:38:58,910
think.
You know,

3782
02:38:58,920 --> 02:39:02,600
I,
I follow a bunch of wackadoos on twitter

3783
02:39:02,960 --> 02:39:06,440
just so I can listen to them read their 
stuff.

3784
02:39:06,440 --> 02:39:09,800
I follow this one guy,
he's a young earth christian who,

3785
02:39:09,801 --> 02:39:10,634
uh,
every day we'll talk about how horrible 

3786
02:39:11,961 --> 02:39:12,794
obama obama's the death in this country 
and I will follow this guy and follow 

3787
02:39:16,221 --> 02:39:19,220
people who retweet him and go to their 
links and go to their blogs,

3788
02:39:19,230 --> 02:39:20,063
read their blog or what the fuck just 
because I'm just trying to explore how 

3789
02:39:24,831 --> 02:39:27,980
their mind works,
trying to try to piece together how much

3790
02:39:27,981 --> 02:39:31,760
of it is just a bold blanket hatred of 
liberals.

3791
02:39:31,950 --> 02:39:34,490
How much of it is racism,
how much of it is this,

3792
02:39:34,491 --> 02:39:35,324
how much of it is that?
And just trying to objectively assess 

3793
02:39:37,821 --> 02:39:41,510
where their mindset is and what the root
of their thinking is.

3794
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:42,913
That's what I did back in the nineties 
when the holocaust denial movement 

3795
02:39:45,081 --> 02:39:45,914
started taking off and uh,
these guys were appearing on montel 

3796
02:39:48,441 --> 02:39:51,290
williams and donahue and was like,
what?

3797
02:39:51,291 --> 02:39:52,430
Okay,
what is this about?

3798
02:39:52,431 --> 02:39:54,890
Turns out they're in their offices in 
costa mesa.

3799
02:39:55,460 --> 02:39:58,520
So I drove down there and I just sat 
down with the.

3800
02:39:59,060 --> 02:40:01,970
They have a little journal of historical
review and it's like,

3801
02:40:01,971 --> 02:40:03,110
all right,
who are these guys?

3802
02:40:03,470 --> 02:40:05,480
So we had beer and pizza,
you know,

3803
02:40:05,481 --> 02:40:06,690
I just started to get them to open up 
with,

3804
02:40:06,691 --> 02:40:08,620
what is your story here?
right.

3805
02:40:08,690 --> 02:40:10,170
That's the only way to find out what 
they're,

3806
02:40:10,260 --> 02:40:12,100
what's really behind their arguments.
okay.

3807
02:40:12,120 --> 02:40:13,830
They have these arguments,
here's why they're wrong.

3808
02:40:13,860 --> 02:40:14,070
Okay,

3809
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:14,903
but why are they making these arguments?
The only way to find out is actually 

3810
02:40:17,191 --> 02:40:18,024
talked to them and why were they making 
their arguments if some of it's at pure 

3811
02:40:20,641 --> 02:40:21,474
antisemitism,
but also there's some conspiratorial 

3812
02:40:23,971 --> 02:40:24,661
thinking,
you know,

3813
02:40:24,661 --> 02:40:26,970
the jews are doing this but not just the
jews,

3814
02:40:26,971 --> 02:40:28,020
you know,
the media that this.

3815
02:40:28,021 --> 02:40:28,854
And that is one of those exposing the 
mystery thing because it's a little bit 

3816
02:40:31,441 --> 02:40:32,210
of that,
you know,

3817
02:40:32,210 --> 02:40:33,330
the government,
you know,

3818
02:40:33,331 --> 02:40:35,500
they don't want us to know.
They like,

3819
02:40:35,530 --> 02:40:36,390
wait,
who's the thing?

3820
02:40:36,430 --> 02:40:37,470
Because that's us,
right?

3821
02:40:37,560 --> 02:40:38,430
Uh,
well no,

3822
02:40:38,530 --> 02:40:42,690
they have the super power and you know,
so there's a lot of that behind there.

3823
02:40:42,691 --> 02:40:44,200
And then also there's some,
you know,

3824
02:40:44,220 --> 02:40:48,380
basically I can get attention by saying 
this wacko back,

3825
02:40:48,381 --> 02:40:49,214
the wackadoodle kind of stuff and then 
people pay attention to me and that 

3826
02:40:52,081 --> 02:40:53,730
feels good and so I'll run with it.

3827
02:40:54,080 --> 02:40:55,190
No,
david irvine was there,

3828
02:40:55,191 --> 02:40:56,770
a big intellectual and uh,
he,

3829
02:40:56,800 --> 02:41:00,000
he was self trained historian but also a
pretty smart guy,

3830
02:41:00,001 --> 02:41:02,400
good writer.
And he wrote some,

3831
02:41:02,430 --> 02:41:04,950
his early stuff on,
on gerbils and,

3832
02:41:04,951 --> 02:41:06,890
and some of the stuff on the second 
world war was,

3833
02:41:06,891 --> 02:41:07,860
was,
was quite good.

3834
02:41:08,520 --> 02:41:11,520
But then he found he wasn't in the 
academies,

3835
02:41:11,850 --> 02:41:12,683
self-taught and just published his own 
books and kind of made a living doing 

3836
02:41:15,181 --> 02:41:16,014
that.
And he found that when he started 

3837
02:41:18,061 --> 02:41:19,290
migrating toward this,
you know,

3838
02:41:19,291 --> 02:41:20,124
maybe hitler didn't know about the 
holocaust and it was really gerbils and 

3839
02:41:23,251 --> 02:41:25,740
himmler and they're the ones that did it
and hitler didn't know.

3840
02:41:25,741 --> 02:41:28,770
You've all of a sudden he gets all this 
attention and then he,

3841
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:30,033
he concocts this idea of I'll give a 
thousand dollars to anybody that can 

3842
02:41:32,881 --> 02:41:36,510
show me the order from hitler to,
to orchestrate the holocaust.

3843
02:41:36,511 --> 02:41:38,160
You know,
I hereby command,

3844
02:41:38,161 --> 02:41:39,690
we exterminate the jews.

3845
02:41:40,080 --> 02:41:41,700
Okay.
There is no such order,

3846
02:41:42,150 --> 02:41:42,983
there's no single point.
It's a whole conglomerate of little 

3847
02:41:44,940 --> 02:41:45,773
steps along the way from sterilization 
of the feebleminded in the early 

3848
02:41:50,040 --> 02:41:53,280
thirties all the way up to gassing them.
Okay.

3849
02:41:53,281 --> 02:41:56,100
There's like a hundred steps in between 
so there is no single order,

3850
02:41:56,490 --> 02:41:59,640
but that got him all this attention and 
all of a sudden he's a big star at these

3851
02:41:59,820 --> 02:42:00,653
conferences where these people meet.
so I went to some of these and it's 

3852
02:42:03,241 --> 02:42:04,051
like,
whoa,

3853
02:42:04,051 --> 02:42:04,884
okay.
He is being worshiped as this great 

3854
02:42:06,211 --> 02:42:09,420
scholar and and you could sort of see 
how it fed,

3855
02:42:09,870 --> 02:42:12,030
fed the ego,
get a lot of attention.

3856
02:42:12,360 --> 02:42:13,193
So I think that we can't discount it.
Just appear psychology of getting some 

3857
02:42:16,741 --> 02:42:17,574
attention for your views as pushing 
people further than they would normally 

3858
02:42:20,401 --> 02:42:21,121
go.
Yeah,

3859
02:42:21,121 --> 02:42:23,590
I think that'S a very,
very good point because there's a,

3860
02:42:23,680 --> 02:42:24,513
there's a massive attraction to that is 
people are massively attracted to 

3861
02:42:28,770 --> 02:42:31,890
anything that can get them a lot of 
attention.

3862
02:42:31,920 --> 02:42:34,320
Even for a ridiculously controversial 
idea.

3863
02:42:35,040 --> 02:42:35,873
Have you paid attention lately and this 
is one of the most confusing things 

3864
02:42:38,751 --> 02:42:39,584
that's been going on.
There's a gang of people that believe 

3865
02:42:42,211 --> 02:42:44,100
the earth is flat.
Oh yes.

3866
02:42:44,780 --> 02:42:46,440
They're paying attention to this.
I saw that.

3867
02:42:46,441 --> 02:42:50,010
Yes.
I can't believe that in 2016,

3868
02:42:50,011 --> 02:42:50,844
this is really a thing.
If there is a movement that believes 

3869
02:42:53,041 --> 02:42:53,874
that all of the iss pictures,
those are all fake and that all the 

3870
02:42:58,320 --> 02:43:02,550
pictures are just getting attention and 
nothing more.

3871
02:43:02,640 --> 02:43:04,710
Do you think they really believe I've 
watched some videos.

3872
02:43:04,900 --> 02:43:06,330
these fucking people bullying.
Yeah.

3873
02:43:06,331 --> 02:43:09,000
I have a friend who believes it was 
loosely based friend.

3874
02:43:09,060 --> 02:43:10,260
Max everly,
you're out there.

3875
02:43:10,261 --> 02:43:13,870
You fuck.
He's a fantastic pool player,

3876
02:43:13,871 --> 02:43:17,050
but he's out of his fucking mind.
He blog postings about it on facebook.

3877
02:43:17,650 --> 02:43:18,483
I'm like,
max,

3878
02:43:19,550 --> 02:43:20,880
have a conversation with them.
Here's a.

3879
02:43:20,920 --> 02:43:22,960
Here's a good example of why we need 
free speech.

3880
02:43:22,960 --> 02:43:24,550
You know,
these people should not be centered.

3881
02:43:24,551 --> 02:43:27,120
Let them say what they want to say and 
let's,

3882
02:43:27,150 --> 02:43:29,470
let's show how we do know the earth is 
round.

3883
02:43:29,471 --> 02:43:30,304
Let's see.
Can you articulate five reasons why the 

3884
02:43:32,241 --> 02:43:33,074
earth is?
Why don't you tell max aberly why the 

3885
02:43:34,241 --> 02:43:35,320
earth is located?
Okay,

3886
02:43:35,321 --> 02:43:36,520
max,
here's the deal.

3887
02:43:36,550 --> 02:43:38,080
All right,
so first of all,

3888
02:43:38,470 --> 02:43:40,180
uh,
when there's an eclipse,

3889
02:43:40,181 --> 02:43:42,820
you can see the shadow of the earth on 
the moon.

3890
02:43:43,050 --> 02:43:44,560
The lunar eclipse.
there it is,

3891
02:43:44,561 --> 02:43:47,050
it's current.
That's the government with a projector.

3892
02:43:47,130 --> 02:43:48,470
Yeah.
But,

3893
02:43:48,490 --> 02:43:50,640
but you can go out in your own backyard 
with no good.

3894
02:43:50,641 --> 02:43:51,640
Okay.
NoW what they'll say is,

3895
02:43:51,641 --> 02:43:54,160
yeah,
it's round like a pizza flat round.

3896
02:43:54,190 --> 02:43:55,023
Exactly.
That's what I'm saying.

3897
02:43:55,360 --> 02:43:56,920
But of course,
if that were true,

3898
02:43:56,921 --> 02:43:59,110
then why are all the continents?
Uh,

3899
02:43:59,130 --> 02:44:01,180
you know,
why aren't all the continents located on

3900
02:44:01,181 --> 02:44:02,320
the one side of the pizza?

3901
02:44:02,770 --> 02:44:03,603
And if they're on the flip side,
how do you get from one continent to 

3902
02:44:06,101 --> 02:44:08,320
another when you do a transcontinental 
flight?

3903
02:44:08,560 --> 02:44:09,393
Because it,
it,

3904
02:44:09,460 --> 02:44:10,293
you're curving around it.
You're not all of a sudden hitting an 

3905
02:44:12,131 --> 02:44:14,350
edge and then flipping around to the 
backside of the pizza.

3906
02:44:14,950 --> 02:44:16,880
And so there's a second reason,
uh,

3907
02:44:17,530 --> 02:44:19,540
if you,
if you're high up and you look out,

3908
02:44:19,541 --> 02:44:22,480
you can see the mass of a ship sailing 
away.

3909
02:44:22,880 --> 02:44:23,713
The whole goes first and then you see 
the mass last because it's curved and 

3910
02:44:28,570 --> 02:44:29,081
it.
Anyway.

3911
02:44:29,081 --> 02:44:29,914
So there's all these.
If you put a stick here and 500 miles 

3912
02:44:33,971 --> 02:44:34,660
away,
make it.

3913
02:44:34,660 --> 02:44:37,630
I dunno,
a tucumcari New Mexico that's a thousand

3914
02:44:37,630 --> 02:44:39,280
miles from la.
You put a stick there at noon,

3915
02:44:39,281 --> 02:44:43,810
at the same time they'll have different 
shadows because the earth is curved,

3916
02:44:43,811 --> 02:44:47,200
so they're good at 12 noon.
It's actually 1:00

3917
02:44:47,201 --> 02:44:48,034
in New Mexico when it's 12 noon in la 
and that's why we have time zones 

3918
02:44:50,981 --> 02:44:52,180
because it's curved.

3919
02:44:52,240 --> 02:44:53,450
Okay.
And so,

3920
02:44:53,890 --> 02:44:56,290
and when you,
when you want to watch a rocket,

3921
02:44:56,291 --> 02:44:59,590
a space x rocket or nasa rocket launch 
from Florida,

3922
02:44:59,890 --> 02:45:00,723
it arcs.
It's arcane because it's going into 

3923
02:45:02,651 --> 02:45:04,990
orbit and the earth is curved so you 
have to arch out.

3924
02:45:05,020 --> 02:45:08,290
Otherwise it would just go straight up 
and it doesn't do that anyway.

3925
02:45:08,291 --> 02:45:09,550
Those are five different,
you know,

3926
02:45:09,551 --> 02:45:10,384
quick reasons is pretty good.
But you sound like a shill for this 

3927
02:45:13,601 --> 02:45:17,020
round bullshit government.
There was a,

3928
02:45:17,021 --> 02:45:17,854
uh,
the kind of the co-discovered natural 

3929
02:45:19,601 --> 02:45:21,700
selection with darwin guy named alfred 
Russell Wallace.

3930
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,030
He was nuts.
He was way out there.

3931
02:45:24,031 --> 02:45:24,864
I wrote my biography on him and he came 
up with a dream that connected darwin's 

3932
02:45:30,251 --> 02:45:31,084
theories together.
Like is darwin's theories and his 

3933
02:45:34,571 --> 02:45:37,480
theories came together like darwin had a
problem,

3934
02:45:37,540 --> 02:45:38,830
right?
With natural selection.

3935
02:45:39,010 --> 02:45:41,380
Who's trying to figure out how to piece 
it all together.

3936
02:45:41,500 --> 02:45:44,000
He does.
His ideas were not quite there.

3937
02:45:44,001 --> 02:45:45,670
There is a conspiracy theory about that,
that,

3938
02:45:45,671 --> 02:45:46,360
that,
that,

3939
02:45:46,360 --> 02:45:48,320
that darwin cribbed from,
uh,

3940
02:45:48,400 --> 02:45:50,200
from wallace,
I don't think that's the case,

3941
02:45:50,201 --> 02:45:51,034
what it is for them,
but that they sort of combined the 

3942
02:45:53,270 --> 02:45:55,870
simultaneous thing and they were in 
correspondence.

3943
02:45:56,170 --> 02:45:58,390
Wallace actually incorporated some of 
darwin's work.

3944
02:45:58,391 --> 02:45:59,224
Darwin was older than him and he had 
already done quite a bit more work than 

3945
02:46:01,331 --> 02:46:03,280
wallace head.
And in any case,

3946
02:46:03,281 --> 02:46:04,114
wallace was super open minded.
So here's an example of being too open 

3947
02:46:06,981 --> 02:46:10,580
minded in darwin was open and he came up
with new ideas,

3948
02:46:10,581 --> 02:46:14,060
but he's also very skeptical of the 
whole spiritual seance movement that was

3949
02:46:14,061 --> 02:46:16,550
getting big in england.
Walsh's wallace,

3950
02:46:16,551 --> 02:46:17,384
he would go to these seances and hold 
the hands and the table would levitate 

3951
02:46:20,561 --> 02:46:22,510
in darwin.
people don't hear about darwin.

3952
02:46:22,511 --> 02:46:24,470
We'd just like,
I'm not going to us say,

3953
02:46:24,680 --> 02:46:25,940
are you fucking kidding me?

3954
02:46:25,940 --> 02:46:27,230
I mean,
this is insane.

3955
02:46:27,560 --> 02:46:29,960
And Thomas Henry huxley,
the other great scientists said,

3956
02:46:29,970 --> 02:46:31,310
you know,
pay,

3957
02:46:31,550 --> 02:46:33,920
pay five shillings to talk to bottle to 
the dead.

3958
02:46:33,921 --> 02:46:34,754
I mean,
come on,

3959
02:46:35,080 --> 02:46:36,020
but wallace,
oh no,

3960
02:46:36,021 --> 02:46:36,950
I'm going,
this is,

3961
02:46:37,040 --> 02:46:39,190
this might be true.
And uh,

3962
02:46:39,270 --> 02:46:43,910
so he was in and then he made the 
mistake of answering an ad in a magazine

3963
02:46:44,720 --> 02:46:47,210
for a,
of one of these flat earthers who said,

3964
02:46:47,211 --> 02:46:47,910
I give fight,
you know,

3965
02:46:47,910 --> 02:46:49,790
5,000
pounds to 500 pounds,

3966
02:46:49,791 --> 02:46:52,010
I guess it was.
Anybody can prove the earth is round.

3967
02:46:52,020 --> 02:46:54,170
So what year was this?
This was 18.

3968
02:46:54,680 --> 02:46:56,870
This was the 18,
a psa.

3969
02:46:56,990 --> 02:46:59,510
18 eighties.
And so while I said,

3970
02:46:59,511 --> 02:47:00,344
okay,
I can do it.

3971
02:47:00,770 --> 02:47:01,603
So they went to the old bedford canal,
which is like 20 miles straight without 

3972
02:47:06,231 --> 02:47:07,064
a band.
So you could set up two little 

3973
02:47:09,140 --> 02:47:10,200
telescopes,
you know,

3974
02:47:10,210 --> 02:47:12,500
those little survey or telescopes.

3975
02:47:12,860 --> 02:47:14,850
And they put a mark on a bridge.
Okay.

3976
02:47:16,460 --> 02:47:18,590
And so when I'm looking.
So there's one,

3977
02:47:18,591 --> 02:47:19,580
two,
three marks.

3978
02:47:19,940 --> 02:47:22,100
If it's straight,
then it should be all lined up.

3979
02:47:22,101 --> 02:47:22,934
If it's curved than the one here.
That's exactly three feet above the 

3980
02:47:25,101 --> 02:47:26,090
ground.
Like this one here,

3981
02:47:26,091 --> 02:47:28,850
that's five miles down the road,
down the canal,

3982
02:47:29,120 --> 02:47:30,560
it,
it should be lined up.

3983
02:47:30,561 --> 02:47:32,240
Or if it's not,
it's dropped a little bit.

3984
02:47:32,300 --> 02:47:33,133
And in five miles you could actually 
measure a little bit of the earth's 

3985
02:47:35,030 --> 02:47:36,350
curve by like,
I don't know,

3986
02:47:36,400 --> 02:47:38,440
it's like a centimeter,
half a centimeter or something.

3987
02:47:38,450 --> 02:47:39,201
Right?
There it is,

3988
02:47:39,201 --> 02:47:39,891
right?
There it is.

3989
02:47:39,891 --> 02:47:40,724
There's the old bedford canal.
So wallace did that and they had a 

3990
02:47:43,221 --> 02:47:46,550
neutral judge who looked through the 
telescope and said,

3991
02:47:46,551 --> 02:47:47,510
yep,
it's curved,

3992
02:47:47,511 --> 02:47:49,010
it's dropped.
And,

3993
02:47:49,040 --> 02:47:52,330
and this guy that flatter,
if they refuse to look through the,

3994
02:47:52,350 --> 02:47:53,450
I'm not going to look through there.

3995
02:47:53,450 --> 02:47:55,470
I know you're wrong.
And uh,

3996
02:47:55,480 --> 02:47:56,450
and wallace,
he,

3997
02:47:56,600 --> 02:47:59,630
so he had to sue this guy to collect the
prize money.

3998
02:48:00,200 --> 02:48:01,033
This is why you shouldn't get involved 
with a wackadoodle people too far 

3999
02:48:03,471 --> 02:48:04,304
because he spent 15 years dealing with 
this guy and this guy was sending crazy 

4000
02:48:09,201 --> 02:48:12,020
letters to his wife and to the natural 
geographical.

4001
02:48:12,130 --> 02:48:15,020
I actually found some of these letters 
that the national geographical society,

4002
02:48:15,410 --> 02:48:16,850
uh,
this guy threatening,

4003
02:48:16,851 --> 02:48:17,684
you know,
you've got this crazy man wallace 

4004
02:48:19,461 --> 02:48:20,600
working for it.
And so on,

4005
02:48:21,430 --> 02:48:21,920
you know,
these,

4006
02:48:21,920 --> 02:48:24,290
some of these people are,
they're a little mentally,

4007
02:48:24,720 --> 02:48:26,430
as you know,
a changed.

4008
02:48:27,050 --> 02:48:29,060
That's fascinating.
But wallace,

4009
02:48:29,240 --> 02:48:30,073
his ideas converged with darwin's ideas 
and it kind of helped darwin's theory 

4010
02:48:35,640 --> 02:48:37,170
would disown them eventually.
No,

4011
02:48:37,171 --> 02:48:37,511
no.
What,

4012
02:48:37,511 --> 02:48:38,050
what,
what,

4013
02:48:38,050 --> 02:48:38,883
what,
what really happened was it accelerated 

4014
02:48:40,521 --> 02:48:42,550
darwin to get his work done.
So you get the book done.

4015
02:48:42,570 --> 02:48:45,470
He was just sort of lollygagging around 
doing his research.

4016
02:48:46,010 --> 02:48:49,220
And one reason for that is I'm in 18,
44,

4017
02:48:49,221 --> 02:48:52,670
there was a book on evolution published 
called the vestiges of creation.

4018
02:48:53,330 --> 02:48:57,410
It was published anonymously and it was 
trashed by the scientific community.

4019
02:48:57,840 --> 02:48:59,930
So,
so darwin got back from the galapagos in

4020
02:48:59,931 --> 02:49:01,810
18,
36 throughout the 1840.

4021
02:49:01,850 --> 02:49:05,060
He was just taking notes,
composing his ideas,

4022
02:49:05,061 --> 02:49:08,880
running experiments.
You've got married and had 10 kids.

4023
02:49:08,881 --> 02:49:09,714
And he was the,
he had a lot of money invested in the 

4024
02:49:11,461 --> 02:49:12,294
railroad.
So he was a pretty active independent 

4025
02:49:13,921 --> 02:49:15,510
scholar.
And uh,

4026
02:49:15,511 --> 02:49:16,344
and so I just started taking his sweet 
time about developing this theory and 

4027
02:49:18,481 --> 02:49:19,314
also he didn't want to be embarrassed 
and come out with a book that wasn't 

4028
02:49:22,291 --> 02:49:24,930
very solid.
And then he would be criticized,

4029
02:49:24,931 --> 02:49:29,160
so he was just compiling anyway,
one day he gets this letter from wallace

4030
02:49:29,340 --> 02:49:31,560
from the other side of the world is in 
the malaya archipelagos.

4031
02:49:32,370 --> 02:49:37,370
I came up with a few ideas that he had 
like a feverish nightmare from malaria.

4032
02:49:38,390 --> 02:49:39,223
And he hatched this natural selection.
Some species compete with others as the 

4033
02:49:43,111 --> 02:49:46,220
populations increase in a and way.
Uh,

4034
02:49:46,340 --> 02:49:48,990
and so not all of them can survive.
Some will survive.

4035
02:49:49,020 --> 02:49:51,450
Differential reproductive success,
natural selection.

4036
02:49:51,480 --> 02:49:53,390
Boom.
So he outlines this to darwin.

4037
02:49:53,391 --> 02:49:55,020
Darwin is reading this going,
oh crap,

4038
02:49:55,260 --> 02:49:56,730
this is my idea.
I mean,

4039
02:49:56,731 --> 02:49:58,890
he,
he sort of outlined like my book.

4040
02:49:59,430 --> 02:50:03,630
So then he rushed into print.
It's like I gotta get this done.

4041
02:50:03,840 --> 02:50:06,570
So they weren't necessarily 
collaborating.

4042
02:50:06,630 --> 02:50:09,120
They weren't exactly collaborating,
although they had communicated.

4043
02:50:09,180 --> 02:50:10,013
And also darwin,
not only was wallace not upset about 

4044
02:50:12,241 --> 02:50:13,410
this,
he was thrilled.

4045
02:50:13,411 --> 02:50:14,760
He wrote his mom and said,
oh my god,

4046
02:50:14,761 --> 02:50:16,950
the great charles darwin wrote me back.
This is so cool.

4047
02:50:17,430 --> 02:50:18,263
And then darwin went to charles lyell 
and some of the other big scientists at 

4048
02:50:21,331 --> 02:50:24,110
the time and said,
I got this letter from,

4049
02:50:24,310 --> 02:50:26,190
from this guy on the other side and you 
know,

4050
02:50:26,191 --> 02:50:27,210
I've been working on this.

4051
02:50:28,110 --> 02:50:31,080
This is really similar and uh,
what do I do?

4052
02:50:31,410 --> 02:50:32,230
So they said,
alright,

4053
02:50:32,230 --> 02:50:34,260
we'll publish both of them 
simultaneously.

4054
02:50:34,261 --> 02:50:37,290
And they did on July 1st 18,
58 at the linnean society.

4055
02:50:37,291 --> 02:50:40,950
They both presented both papers,
some of darwin's notes and,

4056
02:50:41,090 --> 02:50:41,923
and essays he had written in wallaces,
no letter to darwin with a little 

4057
02:50:45,181 --> 02:50:48,300
handwritten paper.
And they entered in both into the record

4058
02:50:48,480 --> 02:50:49,350
the same day,
july,

4059
02:50:49,351 --> 02:50:50,310
first 18,
58,

4060
02:50:50,370 --> 02:50:51,870
boom,
simultaneous discovery,

4061
02:50:52,230 --> 02:50:53,063
wallace darwin.
Then spent the next basically nine 

4062
02:50:55,381 --> 02:50:56,214
months.
Just the pen moves mighty fast when 

4063
02:50:58,501 --> 02:50:59,700
you're afraid you're going to get 
scooped,

4064
02:50:59,800 --> 02:51:00,920
right?
Right.

4065
02:51:01,050 --> 02:51:02,640
And he goT his book done.
Boom,

4066
02:51:02,641 --> 02:51:05,970
november 18 slash 59 origin species.
The rest is history.

4067
02:51:06,210 --> 02:51:07,800
And wallace,
he wrote again,

4068
02:51:07,801 --> 02:51:08,491
is,
oh my god,

4069
02:51:08,491 --> 02:51:09,690
this is so exciting.
You know,

4070
02:51:09,740 --> 02:51:12,690
I'm part of this great movement.
And then only later,

4071
02:51:12,691 --> 02:51:13,524
much,
much later did other people start to 

4072
02:51:14,671 --> 02:51:14,971
think,
you know,

4073
02:51:14,971 --> 02:51:17,370
he ripped you off and,
and he's like,

4074
02:51:17,371 --> 02:51:19,010
nah,
it's [inaudible].

4075
02:51:19,080 --> 02:51:24,080
Wallace wrote his great book in 18 
eighties called darwinism.

4076
02:51:24,540 --> 02:51:25,373
So what's really fascinating that he 
came up with that theory based on a 

4077
02:51:30,151 --> 02:51:33,400
dream from being in a fever state.
Yep.

4078
02:51:33,640 --> 02:51:35,490
How amazing it went.
Well,

4079
02:51:35,491 --> 02:51:36,330
but that often,
you know,

4080
02:51:36,331 --> 02:51:40,380
the spark of a scientific genius or 
creativity in any field.

4081
02:51:40,590 --> 02:51:43,580
I was taking a shower and boom,
the idea came to me.

4082
02:51:43,600 --> 02:51:45,960
I was on a walk.
So there's some theories about this that

4083
02:51:46,290 --> 02:51:49,230
if you think too hard and focused on a 
specific problem,

4084
02:51:49,750 --> 02:51:52,110
you can't.
You have to sort of relax your brain,

4085
02:51:52,740 --> 02:51:57,740
whatever that means by doing something 
else that's non focused meditation,

4086
02:51:58,170 --> 02:51:59,670
taking a shower,
going for a walk,

4087
02:51:59,671 --> 02:52:00,900
going for a bike ride,
in my case,

4088
02:52:01,140 --> 02:52:01,973
anything that's just sort of not 
thinking about the problem and that we 

4089
02:52:04,471 --> 02:52:07,210
don't know what happens.
Maybe some neurons just started to start

4090
02:52:07,211 --> 02:52:08,470
firing and interacting.

4091
02:52:08,470 --> 02:52:10,780
Different neural networks.
This memory of that,

4092
02:52:10,810 --> 02:52:12,100
this memory of that,
this book,

4093
02:52:12,110 --> 02:52:14,170
you read,
this thing you saw on the internet,

4094
02:52:14,171 --> 02:52:14,561
boom,
boom,

4095
02:52:14,561 --> 02:52:15,460
boom,
they come together.

4096
02:52:15,710 --> 02:52:17,900
But yeah,
we don't know how that happens.

4097
02:52:17,910 --> 02:52:18,743
It's this writers like to do that.
They like to write and then they go for 

4098
02:52:20,921 --> 02:52:21,754
a walk,
right?

4099
02:52:22,150 --> 02:52:23,640
And then after the they're,
you know,

4100
02:52:23,770 --> 02:52:24,603
they're done writing,
they go walk and they try not to think 

4101
02:52:25,901 --> 02:52:29,050
about anything and then the ideas will 
just pop into their head or a correction

4102
02:52:29,051 --> 02:52:31,570
and the idea or a new revelation and the
idea.

4103
02:52:31,640 --> 02:52:34,660
Yeah,
it's just always been amazing to me.

4104
02:52:34,750 --> 02:52:38,800
Ideas that come out of dreams,
like the origins of creativity,

4105
02:52:38,801 --> 02:52:41,790
like where are these thoughts emanating 
from what?

4106
02:52:42,160 --> 02:52:42,993
Like descartes,
like the idea of science came from a 

4107
02:52:46,331 --> 02:52:49,050
dream,
the dream of uh,

4108
02:52:49,110 --> 02:52:50,350
you know,
being in an elevator,

4109
02:52:50,890 --> 02:52:51,723
you know,
if you're in an elevator and the 

4110
02:52:52,271 --> 02:52:53,104
elevator drops at just the speed of 
gravity and you let go of your pin or 

4111
02:52:57,101 --> 02:52:57,934
your coffee mug,
it's just kinda hover there like you're 

4112
02:52:59,981 --> 02:53:02,440
hovering inside the elevator as it 
drops.

4113
02:53:02,830 --> 02:53:03,663
So thE,
so the acceleration of the elevator at 

4114
02:53:05,591 --> 02:53:09,640
the speed of gravity means there's no 
gravity and that's where he came up with

4115
02:53:09,641 --> 02:53:10,474
this idea of relativity in the elevator 
is the frame of reference that you and 

4116
02:53:14,291 --> 02:53:15,124
the cup or in.
And so this is what weightlessness is 

4117
02:53:17,471 --> 02:53:19,420
when you're,
when you do the vomit comet,

4118
02:53:19,421 --> 02:53:21,580
basically lg as you go up high enough to
drop.

4119
02:53:22,050 --> 02:53:25,660
And so the plane is plunging down for 
about a minute or two,

4120
02:53:25,661 --> 02:53:26,494
I guess I've never done it.
And you and the camera and whoever else 

4121
02:53:29,501 --> 02:53:32,710
is in there is just floating because the
whole frame is dropping.

4122
02:53:33,620 --> 02:53:37,840
And so to do this in,
on the space shuttle for example,

4123
02:53:37,841 --> 02:53:38,890
it has to go,
what?

4124
02:53:38,891 --> 02:53:42,190
Seventeen thousand 500 miles an hour to 
maintain,

4125
02:53:42,510 --> 02:53:43,343
uh,
the same speed at which accelerating at 

4126
02:53:45,641 --> 02:53:46,474
which it would also drop.
So you're going straightforward and 

4127
02:53:48,251 --> 02:53:48,910
straight down.

4128
02:53:48,910 --> 02:53:52,540
The halfway in between is 17,500
miles an hour for our planet.

4129
02:53:52,570 --> 02:53:54,660
That's,
that's basically it.

4130
02:53:54,661 --> 02:53:57,290
I create zero gravity.
So if you want to go to mars and,

4131
02:53:57,291 --> 02:53:57,881
and,
and,

4132
02:53:57,881 --> 02:54:00,340
and have some gravity,
you just spin the spaceship.

4133
02:54:00,970 --> 02:54:04,030
So that yet,
so that the floor is the outside wall,

4134
02:54:04,240 --> 02:54:06,460
that's why in and that's how you get 
your gravity.

4135
02:54:06,461 --> 02:54:08,860
That's how you get to grab it,
like in 2000,

4136
02:54:09,580 --> 02:54:10,570
2000,
one or one of them.

4137
02:54:10,600 --> 02:54:11,720
But space.
Honestly,

4138
02:54:11,740 --> 02:54:14,440
the thing spinning the space station was
spinning.

4139
02:54:14,740 --> 02:54:17,920
So by spinning it creates a false sense 
of gravity.

4140
02:54:18,370 --> 02:54:19,203
Uh oh,
I know what it was in 2001 where he was 

4141
02:54:20,621 --> 02:54:24,710
running along that curved interior.
So it's,

4142
02:54:24,750 --> 02:54:26,860
it's,
it's spinning like this,

4143
02:54:26,861 --> 02:54:30,940
so it presses against the floor.
It's like those old carnival,

4144
02:54:31,090 --> 02:54:31,923
um,
things where you go in and you're 

4145
02:54:33,640 --> 02:54:34,900
standing on the floor,
drops out,

4146
02:54:34,901 --> 02:54:36,640
is it spin and you spent on the outside.

4147
02:54:36,650 --> 02:54:38,870
That's right.
That's the same principle there.

4148
02:54:38,890 --> 02:54:39,723
Uh,
yeah.

4149
02:54:39,910 --> 02:54:43,510
So it's just amazing that ideas can come
out of nowhere.

4150
02:54:43,540 --> 02:54:45,100
The origin of ideas.
That's,

4151
02:54:45,110 --> 02:54:48,370
that's a fascinating thing to me.
Like creativity where,

4152
02:54:48,430 --> 02:54:51,430
how does one person come up with a great
idea for a movie?

4153
02:54:51,431 --> 02:54:54,520
How does someone come up with an amazing
idea for an invention?

4154
02:54:54,730 --> 02:54:57,340
Like where are these ideas emanating 
from?

4155
02:54:58,180 --> 02:54:58,871
Well,
first of all,

4156
02:54:58,871 --> 02:55:01,630
you have to have some knowledge of what 
it is you're trying to create,

4157
02:55:01,660 --> 02:55:04,800
you know,
you and I have a knowledge of evolution.

4158
02:55:04,801 --> 02:55:05,780
Yes.
he read quite a bit.

4159
02:55:05,781 --> 02:55:06,614
Yeah,
he was totally into this for years as 

4160
02:55:07,671 --> 02:55:09,740
was darwin.
So the dream state,

4161
02:55:09,741 --> 02:55:10,810
even mozart,
you know,

4162
02:55:10,811 --> 02:55:14,600
he was composing since the age of four 
and his father was a composer.

4163
02:55:14,630 --> 02:55:16,520
So it's not like this comes out of the 
vacuum.

4164
02:55:16,521 --> 02:55:18,530
There's not abused that pops into your 
head.

4165
02:55:19,170 --> 02:55:20,001
Um,
you know,

4166
02:55:20,001 --> 02:55:23,190
you and I are going to come up with an 
einstein type dream because we're not an

4167
02:55:23,200 --> 02:55:25,590
einstein and we're not physicists and 
uh,

4168
02:55:25,620 --> 02:55:28,040
you know,
so you have to have the balance seems to

4169
02:55:28,041 --> 02:55:28,874
be being ensconced in a field to know 
what the problems are to be solved and 

4170
02:55:33,201 --> 02:55:35,030
what the details are and what's already 
been done.

4171
02:55:35,031 --> 02:55:36,350
You know,
they tried this to drive this,

4172
02:55:36,351 --> 02:55:37,184
this didn't work and so on,
but not be so entrenched in it that you 

4173
02:55:40,161 --> 02:55:44,740
can't see outside the box and no one 
knows what that is.

4174
02:55:45,110 --> 02:55:45,943
We know.
No,

4175
02:55:46,220 --> 02:55:47,810
it's just,
it's so interesting.

4176
02:55:47,900 --> 02:55:51,140
Creativity in and of itself is so 
interesting because boom,

4177
02:55:51,290 --> 02:55:52,370
an idea,
you know,

4178
02:55:52,371 --> 02:55:54,560
like where's the,
how does that take place?

4179
02:55:54,561 --> 02:55:57,450
Like what is,
what's the birth of the idea,

4180
02:55:57,680 --> 02:55:58,513
what are the mechanisms that are going 
on inside the mind that allow the 

4181
02:56:01,431 --> 02:56:02,264
imagination to give birth to this idea 
that's so it's so poorly understood and 

4182
02:56:07,401 --> 02:56:09,650
part of the problem of trying to 
understand it is the,

4183
02:56:09,710 --> 02:56:11,120
what I call the biography by us.

4184
02:56:11,120 --> 02:56:13,570
We only know abouT the successful people
right now.

4185
02:56:13,571 --> 02:56:16,040
So steve jobs and bill gates.
Okay.

4186
02:56:16,041 --> 02:56:17,660
So the thing is you go to college and 
drop out,

4187
02:56:17,661 --> 02:56:20,270
you move into your parents' house,
you start a company in your garage,

4188
02:56:20,271 --> 02:56:21,500
and boom,
right?

4189
02:56:21,530 --> 02:56:22,363
Okay.
how many people did this back in the 

4190
02:56:23,511 --> 02:56:24,344
seventies?
And we don't even know who they are 

4191
02:56:25,461 --> 02:56:26,294
because they failed all those venture 
capital startup companies that went out 

4192
02:56:29,451 --> 02:56:30,161
of business.
You know,

4193
02:56:30,161 --> 02:56:34,010
all these great ideas.
Okay?

4194
02:56:34,011 --> 02:56:34,844
So we,
you know,

4195
02:56:34,970 --> 02:56:37,660
we don't know what the formula is a 
well,

4196
02:56:37,670 --> 02:56:38,503
not only that,
what made you who you are right now at 

4197
02:56:41,150 --> 02:56:42,110
12,
oh,

4198
02:56:42,111 --> 02:56:45,290
seven was a March 7th or whatever the 
hell it is.

4199
02:56:45,470 --> 02:56:46,580
What made you,
you,

4200
02:56:46,720 --> 02:56:50,090
you're 60 plus years of life 
experiences,

4201
02:56:50,650 --> 02:56:52,400
you know,
being awake for,

4202
02:56:52,420 --> 02:56:55,400
you know,
18 hours plus a day doing this,

4203
02:56:55,401 --> 02:56:56,234
doing that.
Like what,

4204
02:56:56,390 --> 02:56:59,650
what chain of events,
what foods did you eat,

4205
02:56:59,660 --> 02:57:01,070
how much sleep did you get?

4206
02:57:01,310 --> 02:57:02,143
What led these ideas to cross each other
and bank and a little fire gets lit and 

4207
02:57:06,381 --> 02:57:07,214
that,
and then you write it down on a napkin 

4208
02:57:08,840 --> 02:57:11,930
and your life changes and yet nobody 
knows too many variables.

4209
02:57:11,931 --> 02:57:14,240
So fascinaTing.
So fascinating.

4210
02:57:14,990 --> 02:57:17,420
Just the mind and the way the mind 
works.

4211
02:57:17,510 --> 02:57:19,280
It's a,
it's so,

4212
02:57:19,340 --> 02:57:20,173
it's such a mystery and yet there's so 
much information about it at the same 

4213
02:57:23,241 --> 02:57:23,960
time.
Yup.

4214
02:57:23,960 --> 02:57:26,570
Well,
it is the hardest problem I think in all

4215
02:57:26,571 --> 02:57:28,250
of science consciousness.
The brain.

4216
02:57:28,251 --> 02:57:30,140
How does it work?
I mean not we know how it works,

4217
02:57:30,390 --> 02:57:32,630
how the neuro neurons communicate with 
each other.

4218
02:57:32,780 --> 02:57:37,670
Neurochemically and how say that your 
visual cortex is see stuff,

4219
02:57:37,671 --> 02:57:38,504
but,
but what is it that you and I are doing 

4220
02:57:39,981 --> 02:57:40,814
now?
just just we're experiencing this 

4221
02:57:42,501 --> 02:57:44,270
process.
How does that happen?

4222
02:57:44,340 --> 02:57:45,173
And that no one knows.
We don't have a cogent theory of 

4223
02:57:48,171 --> 02:57:49,004
consciousness,
which is why then people step in with 

4224
02:57:50,900 --> 02:57:53,260
quantum consciousness or you know,
whatever.

4225
02:57:53,330 --> 02:57:57,350
They have all these theories because we 
don't know those people get.

4226
02:57:57,500 --> 02:58:01,980
They get me baffled.
I've had a few of those people and have

4227
02:58:01,980 --> 02:58:04,350
conversations with people about quantum 
consciousness and you're like,

4228
02:58:04,360 --> 02:58:04,760
what?
No,

4229
02:58:04,760 --> 02:58:05,593
I don't even know what you're saying.
I don't even know if you know what 

4230
02:58:06,811 --> 02:58:08,820
you're saying.
That's exactly right.

4231
02:58:08,821 --> 02:58:11,300
So you know,
quantum physics is a,

4232
02:58:11,320 --> 02:58:15,810
it is difficult in spooky and 
consciousness is difficult and spooky,

4233
02:58:16,770 --> 02:58:18,740
but that doesn't mean they're related.
You know,

4234
02:58:18,750 --> 02:58:20,700
maybe they're related,
but maybe they're not relating.

4235
02:58:20,730 --> 02:58:21,563
Well,
I'm glad someone's out there exploring 

4236
02:58:22,360 --> 02:58:23,790
and I check in on him every now and 
then.

4237
02:58:23,970 --> 02:58:25,860
How you doing over there?
Absolutely.

4238
02:58:25,861 --> 02:58:30,861
that's the theory is evolving.
I'm not sure.

4239
02:58:30,910 --> 02:58:32,160
Yeah.
I'm not sure about any of it,

4240
02:58:32,190 --> 02:58:33,350
but listen man,
we're,

4241
02:58:33,351 --> 02:58:36,160
we're basically out of time.
We just did three hours yet.

4242
02:58:36,380 --> 02:58:37,620
Crazy.
That was crazy.

4243
02:58:37,740 --> 02:58:42,210
I really appreciate your time and you're
getting all your work over the years.

4244
02:58:42,211 --> 02:58:43,044
That's really been wonderful to read and
have you on here and thank you for 

4245
02:58:45,331 --> 02:58:47,040
saying so.
Is this your most recent?

4246
02:58:47,180 --> 02:58:48,013
Yep.
You can take that with you on your 

4247
02:58:49,260 --> 02:58:52,410
vacation to very,
very much the moral consciousness.

4248
02:58:52,480 --> 02:58:53,740
Yeah,
I'm going,

4249
02:58:53,880 --> 02:58:54,980
I'm going.
And uh,

4250
02:58:54,990 --> 02:58:57,240
if people want to get ahold of you on 
twitter,

4251
02:58:57,241 --> 02:59:01,200
it's michael shermer on twitter website 
skeptic.com

4252
02:59:01,201 --> 02:59:02,310
or michael shermer.
Dicom.

4253
02:59:02,730 --> 02:59:03,630
Thanks sir.
Appreciate it.

4254
02:59:03,660 --> 02:59:05,300
You're welcome.
Thanks for having me folks.

4255
02:59:05,370 --> 02:59:06,203
See ya.

4256
02:59:18,630 --> 02:59:19,463
Mm.

4257
02:59:22,690 --> 02:59:23,680
Alright,
cool.
