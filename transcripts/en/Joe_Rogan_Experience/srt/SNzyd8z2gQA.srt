1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,513
Okay.

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,050
[inaudible]

3
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,503
I really like,

4
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,950
it's like it's more than it is.

5
00:00:20,951 --> 00:00:24,460
It's like what they were afraid of was
pirate radio where everyone can have

6
00:00:24,461 --> 00:00:25,450
their own radio station.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,110
You know,

8
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,120
they wanted to control that,

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:27,830
regulate that.

10
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:28,663
I can't remember now,

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,220
but now the podcast is way more pervasive
than even just regular prior pirate

12
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,070
pirate radio because you can listen
to it when there's no radio signal.

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,720
You can listen to her iPhone,

14
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,840
iPad or an iPhone rather and,

15
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:40,011
and,

16
00:00:40,011 --> 00:00:40,930
and keep that shit.

17
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,290
You know in the gym you could,

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,740
you could listen to it on planes
so you could listen to it.

19
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:45,311
You know,

20
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:48,100
you could have an iPod and take it with
you in the bathroom if you want to.

21
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,900
You can go swimming with those fucking,

22
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,760
they have waterproof iPod containers.

23
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:53,230
You can listen to that
shit while you're swimming.

24
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,483
You know,

25
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,060
there you need a reality show.

26
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,953
That's what you need to,

27
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:57,823
you're a Weirdo.

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,180
You're an interesting motherfucker.

29
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,043
People would like to,

30
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,520
I like to watch you have one.

31
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:02,360
I know,

32
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,560
but I'm saying you need one on TV.

33
00:01:03,561 --> 00:01:06,260
Someone needs to snatch that shut
up and just follow you around with

34
00:01:06,261 --> 00:01:07,400
professional cameras and shit.

35
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:07,881
I mean,

36
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:08,601
the thing that you're doing,

37
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:11,090
I'm mastering the system is cool
and it's letting people know,

38
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,213
oh no budget.

39
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,213
He rolled budget,

40
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,150
you know,

41
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:14,990
there's a little budget.

42
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,700
I am paying someone to put it together,

43
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,260
but it's like minimal shit.

44
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:18,920
You know what I mean?

45
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,940
If there was some kind of budget,

46
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:21,440
it would be nice where I can have someone,

47
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,670
when I can just tell someone
to do anything and like a,

48
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,920
like a producer dude and I go,

49
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,641
I want this.

50
00:01:25,641 --> 00:01:26,031
I want that.

51
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:28,640
Once I get to the point where I have a
guide that will just do everything that I

52
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:32,150
say and I could afford a Pam or
someone else's paying him once,

53
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:35,150
then everything's going to go right
because there's so much shit I want to do.

54
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,640
I just don't have time
to do everything now.

55
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,543
Right.

56
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,590
Every day is packed with
shit and I'm not even trying.

57
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,040
Just everyday is just so busy.

58
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,930
Yeah.

59
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,440
Well the good thing is you're
doing everything you wanted to.

60
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,700
That's what you know,

61
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,500
like the key to a happy life is,

62
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:50,340
even though you're busy,

63
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:51,930
you're still busy with
things or you enjoy.

64
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,260
Yeah.

65
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,160
I'm not complaining at all.

66
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:53,510
Matt,

67
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,343
every day,

68
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,110
every day.

69
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,620
I love my last name and
I'm not complaining.

70
00:01:56,621 --> 00:01:57,960
I'm just really busy.

71
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:58,460
Yeah.

72
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:58,920
It's just,

73
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,210
it's,

74
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,140
it's sometimes it's hard to,

75
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,363
you know,

76
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,170
I got calmed myself down
and counseled myself.

77
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,680
Dude,

78
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,071
you're lucky.

79
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:06,090
Motherfuckers smile.

80
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,470
You should be laughing right now.

81
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,910
You should be enjoying
the moment right now.

82
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:09,601
What the fuck are you doing?

83
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:11,400
Stressing them out this
and stressing about that.

84
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,300
Forget about that.

85
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,260
I got it every day.

86
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,690
I got myself stripe stress though.

87
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,390
So what keeps you pushing forward?

88
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,350
That's what makes you,

89
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:19,161
what motivates you?

90
00:02:19,161 --> 00:02:20,150
That same drive,

91
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,540
even though sometimes a fresh jar,

92
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,290
it's all this energy that you built
up to try to become successful.

93
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,470
It's very hard to become successful and
be really laid back at the same time.

94
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,750
And a lot of times people
just don't push far enough.

95
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,540
It's just you've got to learn
when to chill out and when not to.

96
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,130
But in order to really push forward,

97
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,690
you gotta be pretty intense,

98
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,051
you know,

99
00:02:36,051 --> 00:02:37,190
to really get shit done.

100
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,151
There's no way.

101
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:38,361
It just,

102
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:40,490
it's hard to be laid back
and to get shit done.

103
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,200
You know,

104
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,350
you've got to get got to get her up,

105
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,070
you know,

106
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:43,940
just crazy man.

107
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,430
Yeah.

108
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:44,991
Crazy shit.

109
00:02:44,991 --> 00:02:45,980
It's all good stuff though.

110
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,720
What's going on with you Brian?

111
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,913
What's the latest?

112
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,401
Get tired.

113
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:53,234
Why are you tired?

114
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,440
It's doing a lot of work.

115
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:54,550
Work.

116
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,231
I'm really busy.

117
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:56,460
Like it's like you're in better shape.

118
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,863
I've been working out.

119
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,171
No,

120
00:02:58,171 --> 00:02:58,560
it's fine.

121
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,340
He's been fucking and eating bananas.

122
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,710
Look at them.

123
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,543
I see you haven't.

124
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,393
This is what he does.

125
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,270
Fucking go.

126
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,140
Reladyne fucking eat bananas.

127
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,730
Fuck three times in the drink.

128
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,660
Sparkling Water and he eats bananas and
he fucks in every now and then it goes

129
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:14,471
to Starbucks,

130
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:15,470
the gorilla diet.

131
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,440
I've been making big commercial.

132
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,980
I've been reading the
Kalyan whatever diet,

133
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:26,370
Paleo Sally and she a little commercial
parody then you and Dunkin shoot.

134
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,400
That would be fucking great.

135
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,100
Your Diet.

136
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,390
It's just soda water.

137
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:33,700
Like Perrier bananas and Fucking Dude.

138
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:34,800
That'd be a funny video.

139
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,420
You could have champagne if you,

140
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,001
this is what you,

141
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:38,410
this is your workout routine.

142
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,273
This is what you do.

143
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,000
Show it like you gotta you
gotta spend 10 minutes Doggy,

144
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,190
10 minutes fucking not
an aerobic activity.

145
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,860
Some sort of serious fucking

146
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,620
that shit that's your,

147
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,150
that's your was roam around alone.

148
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,030
She's gotta be on top and she's got
to keep moving and you've got at least

149
00:03:55,031 --> 00:03:55,990
thrust the hips,

150
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,680
you know what I mean?

151
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,650
You can't just lay that out and
you gotta go home gotta work.

152
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:01,990
You gotta grab her ass too.

153
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:02,973
And you know what

154
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,990
you're working on lasting longer.

155
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:09,190
So the girl benefits too.

156
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:10,120
So you'd get more girls,

157
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:11,680
they want to come back
because you're on this diet,

158
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,543
they want to come back,

159
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,470
go back like you're a rider.

160
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,181
You know what I mean?

161
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:17,290
You're a fucking machine.

162
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,620
You go 45 minutes on that bitch was the
last time you fucked for 45 minutes and

163
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,840
last night did you do it
well or did you cry a lot?

164
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:27,360
So you think people would on,

165
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,930
did you cry it off after you come
once and then you in my question like,

166
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,880
like five minutes later and it's like
you don't really have to come again,

167
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:37,990
but your dick still hard.

168
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:38,770
So that's great.

169
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,460
We'll the shot like you might be,

170
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:41,870
this is a,

171
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,180
you're in a new relationship right now.

172
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,300
We should stipulate that Brian May be
starting out with a pace that he can't

173
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:46,890
keep up.

174
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:47,650
That's true.

175
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,370
It would a woman who complained that
she's only you only fucking her because

176
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,630
you're on this fucking diet.

177
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:52,961
You know,

178
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:55,150
you're only fucking me cause
it's not the fucking day.

179
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,040
You wouldn't be fucking me.

180
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:57,791
You should cut.

181
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:58,650
Stop talking to that girl.

182
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,270
She sounds like Eddie just sounded like

183
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,600
don't talk to a girl like that.

184
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:05,230
Okay.

185
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,250
Those bitches are crazy.

186
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:07,791
So,

187
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:07,950
uh,

188
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:12,700
this weekend we've got Joey Diaz next
excited to do the next podcast with Joey

189
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:13,550
video.

190
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,383
Mother fucker off.

191
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,260
This motherfucker were high and he
starts talking about earthquakes and was

192
00:05:22,261 --> 00:05:25,090
going to happen because
Brian's cast retarded

193
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:29,483
fucking earthquake.

194
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,000
If you're catching the
sweetness cats in the world,

195
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,230
that's very chilled as cats.

196
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,060
If they're acting kind of jumpy.

197
00:05:35,061 --> 00:05:35,900
Something's going on.

198
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,460
We both been here before.

199
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,350
They're not uncomfortable with us.

200
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,970
That'd be a little slim is covered.

201
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,680
The big ones.

202
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,450
I had San Francisco waiting for his ass.

203
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,800
That's the one that's stuck in geologists.

204
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,821
No so much.

205
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:51,530
Why didn't you make a phone call to Japan?

206
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,793
Because

207
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,000
Japan is just the eyes now.

208
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,000
We've already hit fucking earthquake.

209
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:58,460
Locale.

210
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,150
What's the flex and mash was
back to smoking cigarettes.

211
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,630
Although I'm getting dizzy already busy.

212
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,900
Really busy.

213
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:06,021
Well,

214
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:07,730
I just smoke one just to
get the party started.

215
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,690
Site.

216
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,230
It gets applied.

217
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:09,600
He signed.

218
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:09,790
Yeah.

219
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,130
Make sure the loans are attack.

220
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,070
Gives you a jumping jack site.

221
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,430
I got to make sure that these
fucking lungs are working.

222
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:16,661
What are it?

223
00:06:16,661 --> 00:06:18,040
Go to the gym four and do all this shit.

224
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:18,761
If I can't puff.

225
00:06:18,761 --> 00:06:21,520
I got a test of it is sort of
like weightlifting for your lungs.

226
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,401
Cigarettes.

227
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:25,234
There's nothing better for you.

228
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,930
I see Brian's dirty laundry now.

229
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,350
This is where it folds to

230
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,240
when he wants to get crazy.

231
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,870
Go skateboarding Simpson's style around
the neighborhood that were rubbing her.

232
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,823
Fuck.

233
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,570
See more to your door.

234
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,561
No beef,

235
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:45,394
no more.

236
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,660
Where did that come from?

237
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,300
You couldn't smoke in a
fucking weed to get that line

238
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,601
to your door.

239
00:06:51,601 --> 00:06:55,750
See wants some of these names through
without seeing more to your door.

240
00:06:55,751 --> 00:06:56,381
No beef.

241
00:06:56,381 --> 00:06:57,420
No more Nigga.

242
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,450
Feel the rush.

243
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,313
Dangerous.

244
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,970
The more weed I smoked
the profit on more danger.

245
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,310
Stop.

246
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,470
That's what I'm talking about it.

247
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:05,351
By the way.

248
00:07:05,351 --> 00:07:05,771
Another way.

249
00:07:05,771 --> 00:07:08,740

262
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:29,590
I read like two chapters.

263
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,330
I can't read any more bucks,

264
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:31,530

265
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,620

A space on my hard drive.

268
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,310
I don't want to delete any information.

269
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,301
I really think about that.

270
00:07:37,301 --> 00:07:38,640
Now I'm going to look at the news.

271

00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,410
I remember I liked the first season.

284
00:07:53,411 --> 00:07:55,000
I don't remember anything more about it.

285
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,790

00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,360
It pushed the door and this angel is,

337
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:54,900
I'll go away.

338
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,540
I'm like makeup on when like red
shirt coming out of his nose.

339
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,360
This all pasty.

340
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,440
Some of y'all to talk to angel.

341
00:10:00,441 --> 00:10:01,274
Oh Dean.

342
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,710
So he picked him up by his ankles.

343
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:02,970
Leash,

344
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,290
wakes him up and he's like
Angel and angel saying,

345
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,153
what man,

346
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,510
Tony Montana,

347
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,470
what the fuck I did?

348
00:10:08,471 --> 00:10:09,221
The first show is like,

349
00:10:09,221 --> 00:10:10,054
agent,

350
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,200
you got to do another show.

351
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:11,621
And he's like,

352
00:10:11,621 --> 00:10:13,180
what show are you talking about?

353
00:10:13,181 --> 00:10:14,014
Where am I?

354
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,980
Because Angel,

355
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,880
you got to do a show.

356
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:16,990
So he got it.

357
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,470
He got aids on of dressing.

358
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:23,440
You put an angel and his
little costume born in the USA.

359
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,240
Angel from,

360
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,630
if he goes up there,

361
00:10:25,631 --> 00:10:26,291
this is the song.

362
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,780
He has not changed as accurate.

363
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,633
20 years,

364
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,680
not even a peep.

365
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,030
He has not even had an attack.

366
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,370
He still comes up the board to the USA.

367
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,020
That's all came out 1980
fucking four he understand me.

368
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,920
So he's up there and he's,

369
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,650
he's forgetting the lyrics to
his own song that he wrote.

370
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,730
More than that you are saying,

371
00:10:42,731 --> 00:10:43,564
you know,

372
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,040
five minutes go by.

373
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:50,020
He's up there and fucking habit believe
Tony Montana Chino was just such a novel

374
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,080
that he was the original Scarface.

375
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,770
He still has blown all this shit.

376
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,090
Finally as a chicken,

377
00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:56,920
the first row were big
tennies with a family.

378
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,510
He sits on her lap and started kissing
the attendees and people start booing

379
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,030
him.

380
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,150
So he gets back and off stage.

381
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:02,411
It was like,

382
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,244
fuck you guys,

383
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,780
I take you all to hell.

384
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,120
And they went to sit down and dog.

385
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:06,954
He's just like this.

386
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:07,721
He sat down,

387
00:11:07,721 --> 00:11:10,170
Joe Rogan take y'all to help

388
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,950
pass time,

389
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,060
take bus things had to get my money back.

390
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,650
And every time they did
they took all his blocks.

391
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,530
They took him and put him in his jeep
and they locked the door inside the hotel

392
00:11:23,531 --> 00:11:24,160
room.

393
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,760
The next day they got a
call at six in the morning.

394
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,171
He was like,

395
00:11:26,171 --> 00:11:27,100
well hoppy last night.

396
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:27,761
They're like,

397
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:28,091
angel,

398
00:11:28,091 --> 00:11:28,301
Bro,

399
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:29,110
you had a meltdown.

400
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,620
He goes like,

401
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:29,720
no,

402
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:29,811
no,

403
00:11:29,811 --> 00:11:29,901
no,

404
00:11:29,901 --> 00:11:30,001
no,

405
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:30,121
no,

406
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:30,700
no.

407
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,580
The owner gave you a roofie
cause he didn't want to pay me.

408
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,200
That's what happened.

409
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,990
The older put a roof for your bike
trick cause he didn't want a baby.

410
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,270
I know.

411
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,100
No one knows what he did.

412
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,860
I called Angel soursop top down.

413
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,023
How long ago was that?

414
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:47,141
Three,

415
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:47,974
four months ago.

416
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,933
Wow.

417
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,353
Angel sales.

418
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,420
Rowan warrior for a long time.

419
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,100
When you were there doing the road,

420
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,560
like he's doing the road and you,

421
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,120
you don't really have a
place to live or if you do,

422
00:11:58,121 --> 00:11:58,954
you're never there.

423
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,500
He just go from one spot to
the next going and Dylan,

424
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,110
whatever the fuck anybody's got.

425
00:12:04,111 --> 00:12:04,770
We got heroin.

426
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:05,390
Do you got math?

427
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,223
You got a comb

428
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,523
but drug dealers,

429
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,363
clover club.

430
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,263
Wait for

431
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:12,603
no fucking way,

432
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,270
man.

433
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,103
He's like,

434
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,020
he has this little old gray
of rooms where they just wait.

435
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,140
They just wait for him.

436
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,281
He comes to town.

437
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:22,240
It's fucking nuts.

438
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,030
We're on our way to the Portland.

439
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,280
Helium was to helium's affiliate Portland.

440
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,290
Never been to Portland.

441
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,920
[inaudible]

442
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,140
I swoop as a jet jet again.

443
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,230
Don't want to keep it down in there,

444
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,470
which I'll cry about.

445
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,290
Can't believe I going to deal with this.

446
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:19,270
[inaudible] [inaudible]

447
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,120
which you took that

448
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:40,923
drug.

449
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,250
Oh,

450
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,970
Katy Perry song.

451
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:30,250
First of all,

452
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,050
Portland is the shit.

453
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,850
This town is awesome.

454
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,440
This is one of the coolest,

455
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:36,490
most positive,

456
00:16:36,491 --> 00:16:38,950
most fun crowds we've ever had.

457
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,660
Never has anyone handed me
more weed in any town anywhere.

458
00:16:43,661 --> 00:16:44,950
It's not even a close second.

459
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,460
Portland dominated in the
weed passing out department,

460
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,930
not even close in.

461
00:16:49,931 --> 00:16:54,931
The crowds are cool as fuck and what
we're seeing for sure this weekend is that

462
00:16:55,571 --> 00:16:57,490
we're getting podcast fans now.

463
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,840
It's like almost all podcast fans
who saw that last week in Seattle.

464
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,090
Although joy could attend
because of previous warrants,

465
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,390
the probably that we're going
to get done and taken care of.

466
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,390
Well we're going to contract out little
representatives and see what the fuck is

467
00:17:12,391 --> 00:17:13,224
going down.

468
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,970
But Portland was the shit man.

469
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,830
This is a on a shortlist man.

470
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,470
As far as like bad ass cool cities for me,

471
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,640
this is on a short list.

472
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,391
There's like Austin,

473
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:22,931
Texas.

474
00:17:22,931 --> 00:17:26,710
Portland is right the fuck up
there with Austin in my opinion.

475
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:31,711
Don't you think people are cool as fuck
here and the podcast crowds or this is a

476
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:33,480
different crowd man.

477
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,720
We're getting a different crowd now.

478
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,950
We're getting there.

479
00:17:35,951 --> 00:17:37,840
All fucking nice man.

480
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,480
This is one thing that
waitresses say and they've,

481
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:40,691
oh,

482
00:17:40,691 --> 00:17:42,370
they've just been saying
this for a long time,

483
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,750
but even more so now,

484
00:17:43,751 --> 00:17:48,751
like today day they kept going on
about how friendly the people know.

485
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:54,290
That to me is almost more
satisfying than anything else.

486
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,130
The fact they're loving the show,

487
00:17:56,131 --> 00:17:57,840
the fact they're coming
to having a great time,

488
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,681
that's all great.

489
00:17:58,681 --> 00:18:02,370
But what really makes me feel good
is that I hear that they're nice.

490
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,560
I hear the crowds now.

491
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:05,394
One problem.

492
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,640
No,

493
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,100
look at the shape and where
you guys smoke me the fuck out.

494
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,860
This was you guys teaching.

495
00:18:11,861 --> 00:18:13,130
You're telling me the deck this weekend.

496
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,300
It was just a great ratios,

497
00:18:16,301 --> 00:18:16,941
great grounds.

498
00:18:16,941 --> 00:18:21,120
And we just discussed the staff at the
club is world fucking class and I mean

499
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:21,280
no,

500
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,140
they left us alone.

501
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,590
That's why the shows us so great.

502
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,030
There was no drama.

503
00:18:25,031 --> 00:18:26,110
So thank you very much.

504
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,070
And who was crazy?

505
00:18:28,071 --> 00:18:30,290
It's how many people like
came up to us and said,

506
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:30,910

you really make it my day so much better.

510
00:18:34,101 --> 00:18:35,270
I'm just driving.

511
00:18:35,271 --> 00:18:39,260
I'm doing these like hard jobs or manual
labor jobs and it just an enjoyable,

512
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:39,600

513
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,650
Makes they love it.

514
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:40,740
Right?

515
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,660
How many people did you talk to?

516
00:18:42,661 --> 00:18:43,141
There's like,

517
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:44,280

00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:46,590
You know,

520
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:46,801
I mean,

521
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:48,540
we keep hearing that same thing.

522
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,580
It's that same theme over and over again.

523
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,370
You know,

524
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:51,841
I'm like,

525
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:54,570
I'm hanging out with you guys
and I'm thinking like you guys,

526
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:54,781
I'm,

527
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:59,220
I'm thinking positive and I'm trying to
enjoy my time here and surround myself

528
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,870
with friends who are likeminded.

529
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:01,860
You know,

530
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,330
it's the most important
thing you could do.

531
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,770
We be positive.

532
00:19:04,771 --> 00:19:05,371
Have Fun,

533
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:06,270
enjoy your time.

534
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:09,690
Be Fun to be around surrounding yourself
with other people that are the same

535
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:10,110
way.

536
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,840
And every day you laughing like us.

537
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,380
Joe Does every day.

538
00:19:14,381 --> 00:19:14,580
Oh,

539
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,413
are we laughing?

540
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,190
Every day we're laughing.

541
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,233
I was laughing.

542
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,500
I couldn't even laugh anymore.

543
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,020
What were the crowds?

544
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,130
The crowds were what?

545
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,070
You make me laugh.

546
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,300
I make you laugh.

547
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:25,220
So I mean,

548
00:19:25,221 --> 00:19:25,690
I can't,

549
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,310
I really am blown away.

550
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,410
Wasted.

551
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:31,860
There was so I had a drink.

552
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,031
What did you think,

553
00:19:33,031 --> 00:19:33,301
dude?

554
00:19:33,301 --> 00:19:36,270
Because this was the first
time when you got on stage,

555
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,190
you've got some roars dude.

556
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,040
It was like breaks.

557
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,101
Yeah,

558
00:19:41,101 --> 00:19:41,610
it was.

559
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,470
I can't see your face
on deal a little crazy.

560
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,430
It was so amazing.

561
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:44,861
It was.

562
00:19:44,861 --> 00:19:45,694
It was.

563
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,040
It was insane.

564
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,150
How awesome.

565
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:53,151
Like the crowd reminded me a lot of Texas
just like really happy to see comedy

566
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,090
like a lot of people came out
for after the show was just like,

567
00:19:57,091 --> 00:19:57,271
you know,

568
00:19:57,271 --> 00:20:00,330
we never have experienced
comedy like this before.

569
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:02,880
We never were into stand
up comedy or anything.

570
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,770
This is all new to us.

571
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,320
Well Gee,

572
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,390
that's one of the unique
things about this talent.

573
00:20:07,391 --> 00:20:09,340
Joey can tell you know
the history of this place.

574
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:14,670
I used to come down here in the late
nineties and it was Harvey's at Harvey's

575
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:15,541
was a good club,

576
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,680
but there's too many restrictions.

577
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:17,514
You can't curse.

578
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,440
So just a certain amount of comic.

579
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:21,740
Gilead dirty comic had
one week of dirty comedy.

580
00:20:21,741 --> 00:20:22,321
It was James,

581
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:22,680
Edwin,

582
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,700
Doug Stanhope and me.

583
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:24,780
That's it.

584
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,613
That's what that was like

585
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,463
crazy

586
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,870
putting the drugs or be a magician.

587
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,110
So when the helium opened,

588
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,520
they brought a different
type of comic up here,

589
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:37,480
which opened up the door for a lot of
different comics that wouldn't be allowed

590
00:20:37,481 --> 00:20:40,060
to come up here because of the budget
restrictions or Harvey's or whatnot.

591
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,313
And I'll tell you man,

592
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,470
one of the reasons why I hate trial was
because of the club's fucking with you.

593
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,020
This club and the city was outrageous.

594
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,010
How they are in Philly

595
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:48,580
too,

596
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,200
you know fairly is incredible.

597
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:50,950
Outrageous.

598
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:51,783
Yeah.

599
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,550
I'm happy I can't thank you Paul.

600
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,190
Oh please.

601
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,220
Thank you for the 55
fucking joints and smoking.

602
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:57,600
Uh,

603
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,210
it'd be sick again Tuesday cause
I can't smoke with people pipes.

604
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,260
I smoke where everybody,

605
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,480
if they were that nice I have to
make it out of Portland and did,

606
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,000
we just got done smoking like
eight bulls and 17 joints.

607
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,180
There was one where I'm like
holding two joints on one goal.

608
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,340
It was like being in the eighth grade
that was looking at his phone and she'll

609
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,100
be in the eight grade.

610
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,870
And the first thing I was telling Joel,

611
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,040
there was 60 people,

612
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:21,874
40 people,

613
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:22,211
you know,

614
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:26,890
like a six groups of like six people
and we were smoking and the cop stopped

615
00:21:26,891 --> 00:21:30,520
looking at us and just kept fucking
driving like he thought that restaurant,

616
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:32,921
well I've,

617
00:21:32,921 --> 00:21:35,350
I felt like the vibes of the crowd,

618
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,570
they fell to me like a real,

619
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,480
like a real strong potheads.

620
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,940
It was like a strong pothead crowd.

621
00:21:42,941 --> 00:21:45,970
Like that might've been like 90% stoners.

622
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:46,331
Right.

623
00:21:46,331 --> 00:21:47,380
And it was so great because

624
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,010
everybody was cool as fuck.

625
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,940
Everyone said no,

626
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:54,880
we grow out here.

627
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:56,800
We don't have the stores.

628
00:21:56,801 --> 00:21:58,330
We just grow our super gross.

629
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,100
And apparently they don't give a fuck.

630
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,500
They're not trying to force a shit at all.

631
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,000
Like I get guilt you're we'd known carries
crazy because the club manager came

632
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:08,270
up to me 1130 last night.

633
00:22:08,271 --> 00:22:08,471
He goes,

634
00:22:08,471 --> 00:22:08,801
guys,

635
00:22:08,801 --> 00:22:09,640
I just want to warn you,

636
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:13,550
if you guys did this on Friday,

637
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:13,550
Thursday,

638
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,830
tomorrow's will be completely nuts.

639
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,390
And then went to eat with you guys.

640
00:22:16,391 --> 00:22:18,730
Then I went up to my room and I started
thinking about what he said and they

641
00:22:18,731 --> 00:22:20,320
grew up in my head like a fucking,

642
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:25,120
we'd actually put too much pressure on
me at five 30 I was already dressed and

643
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:25,954
showered.

644
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,520
That's how the crazy game,

645
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,960
because my emotions come
out when I'd be standing up.

646
00:22:31,961 --> 00:22:34,150
When I see people in
the first show tonight,

647
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,240
usually it's a Christian crowd on
Saturday night and some people have

648
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:38,074
babysitters.

649
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,160
These people are fucking nuts.

650
00:22:40,161 --> 00:22:41,050
Thinking up the ride,

651
00:22:41,051 --> 00:22:42,640
they were eating their finger back.

652
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:43,803
They took the wrong,

653
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,600
she only wrote me and said,

654
00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:49,030
I went out there to watch him for 10
minutes and I was listening to you and I

655
00:22:49,031 --> 00:22:49,900
could feel these people,

656
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,860
they were in with you.

657
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,060
It was a movie.

658
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,080
You'll watch a movie.

659
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,930
It was something even sitting
on the side of this place.

660
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:57,070
So thank you bro.

661
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,850
Fucking stone work with me

662
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,600
is a bad ass town.

663
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:09,860
So in short town is
unquestionably the shit.

664
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,160
He was one of the best place
we've ever been performed.

665
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,940
One of the short lists of where
to move when their pocket upsets.

666
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,310
Portland just shot right
the fuck up the charts.

667
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,100
This is how fucking bad ass
Portlanders whomever they have.

668
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:28,290
They have these solar powered
compactor is solar panels on the top.

669
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,980
The sunlight powers this fucking thing.

670
00:23:32,981 --> 00:23:37,650
You throw the trash in there and it
smashes it up into a nice usable cube,

671
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,580
which if you were so inclined,

672
00:23:39,581 --> 00:23:41,290
perhaps you could use
for the construction.

673
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,570
Very biodegradable house.

674
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:45,650
Either way,

675
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,130
this is

676
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:46,963
bad ass shit.

677
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,440
Portland's ahead of the curve.

678
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,100
Yes,

679
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,120
no.
