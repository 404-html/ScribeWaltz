1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,650
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,800
but I was always living in Dallas in and
I was 42 years old when ecstasy hit the

3
00:00:06,991 --> 00:00:09,280
streets Mbma and uh,

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,060
I,

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,400
I'd never taken any drugs.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,540
I didn't even smoke pot.

7
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:14,160
Came out of the navy and everything.

8
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:16,030
And that's the Oregon attorney right in,

9
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,400
in Houston House and attorney.

10
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:19,440
Then in Dallas I started
a computer company.

11
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:23,640
I had a personal computer company that
while in 1981 we outgrows Microsoft,

12
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:23,851
you know,

13
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:26,730
I had four color picture
in Forbes magazine,

14
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:30,450
made the front page of the Wall Street
Journal and really then ibm came in and

15
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:31,710
crushed us like a bug.

16
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,270
Wow.

17
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,400
What was the name of your
computer company ready for?

18
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:36,270
This is in Dallas,

19
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:40,850
Texas named it Dynasty
Dynasty Computer Corporation.

20
00:00:40,851 --> 00:00:41,790
But hilarious.

21
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:42,630
It was a,

22
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,190
we were the amway of computers.

23
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:47,100
I had like 3000 distributors
around the country and uh,

24
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:47,851
it was,

25
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:48,511
it was crazy.

26
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:49,050
And we sold.

27
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,250
We sold this machine.

28
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,440
You want to hear this anymore?

29
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:51,930
Yeah.

30
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,930
It was an eight k machine with 16 K of
Ram and it was a 12 inch black and white

31
00:00:57,451 --> 00:01:02,010
monitor and a cassette tape deck is what
we use for input and output and you'd

32
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:03,030
have to load your,

33
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:03,641
your,

34
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:03,930
uh,

35
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,720
your boot program and then
you'd get a crc error.

36
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:09,560
So you're just the tone and
rewind it and then loaded again.

37
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:10,080
And,

38
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,000
and we sold hundreds of
these for 3000 bucks each.

39
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,020
Why?

40
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,070
And parents would say,

41
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:17,760
you know,

42
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,870
why do I need this,

43
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:19,081
you know,

44
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:20,700
you've got recipe program and,

45
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,560
and Pong and a couple of games.

46
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:23,394
And I said,

47
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,450
I don't know how you need it,

48
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,770
but if your kids don't have this,

49
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,030
they're going to be left behind.

50
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:27,330
Why?

51
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,380
When they're 30 years old.

52
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,210
And uh,

53
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:30,721
later,

54
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:30,851
uh,

55
00:01:30,851 --> 00:01:34,860
I was talking at one of the
job of conventions in San
Francisco and a guy came

56
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:38,970
up to me and gave me his card and he's
CEO of a company like 100 programmers and

57
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:39,090
all.

58
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:39,421
And he said,

59
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:40,111
you don't remember me,

60
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:40,351
do you?

61
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:40,711
And I said,

62
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:40,980
no.

63
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,610
He says,

64
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,020
my dad bought a computer from you.

65
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:44,280
And you told them that would help me.

66
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,630
Wow.

67
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,130
So I don't know if anybody else got help.

68
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:48,990
At least one customer turned out with.

69
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,490
What year was this?

70
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,563
Uh,

71
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,261
let's see.

72
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:53,520
We went out of business.

73
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,610
I started in 79,

74
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,030
79 and we made it to lady for while.

75
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,140
And it was,

76
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:01,800
it was great.

77
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,300
It was,

78
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:02,610
you know,

79
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,910
you heard of the DOTCOM bubble.

80
00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:05,160
Well this was the PC bubble.

81
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,840
It was before ibm got in and,

82
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:07,320
you know,

83
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,530
we'd run short and memory chips and I'd
call up my friend had osborne and he'd

84
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:14,220
shoot me some and then when I got some
back I had shipped him and it was a

85
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,530
closed network is pretty
good old boy thing,

86
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:16,800
you know,

87
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,633
fascinating.

88
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,630
And there's a lot of fun.

89
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,411
It was great fun.

90
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:20,190
But uh,

91
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,180
we didn't know what we're doing,

92
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:21,390
you know,

93
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,280
we're geeks and,

94
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:23,114
and uh,

95
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,410
I didn't know anything
about cash flow or business,

96
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:25,561
you know,

97
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:27,210
I've been an electrical
engineer and a lawyer,

98
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:28,530
but I didn't know anything about business.

99
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:29,410
And so we,

100
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,280
we just sort of sold
ourselves out of business.

101
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:35,670
And by the time we were
done the last six or eight,

102
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:36,241
nine months,

103
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:39,000
I was a financing the
thing by selling ecstasy,

104
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,420
ecstasy come into play.

105
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,350
I was a,

106
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,210
I was doing this computer thing and,

107
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,770
and a close friend of mine,

108
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:47,830
a lawyer in Biloxi,

109
00:02:47,831 --> 00:02:49,860
he called me one day and he says,

110
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,150
what do you know about ecstasy?

111
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:51,600
And I said,

112
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,141
what do you mean?

113
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:52,371
He said,

114
00:02:52,371 --> 00:02:52,461
well,

115
00:02:52,461 --> 00:02:53,191
it's a drug.

116
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:53,461
And I said,

117
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:53,531
well,

118
00:02:53,531 --> 00:02:54,364
I don't do drugs.

119
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:54,631
He says,

120
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:56,220
it's legal now.

121
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:57,240
This isn't Texas.

122
00:02:57,241 --> 00:03:00,220
And at that time you're getting
30 years life for a single joint.

123
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,560
And so there's no way I'd
touched something like that,

124
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:03,070
you know,

125
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,880
and I get join for one joint.

126
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,370
And so he said,

127
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:09,521
no,

128
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:10,330
this is legal.

129
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,410
And I had a friend,

130
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:12,280
a friend of my wife's,

131
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:12,760
actually,

132
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,720
she was a model in town,

133
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:16,540
ran with the fast crowd and I
met with her and she fixed me up.

134
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,260
And uh,

135
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,030
so I got involved in and
then my friend wanted some.

136
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,950
I sent him 50 and I started telling
friends about it and I became really

137
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:25,220
evangelical about it.

138
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,830
And pretty soon I'm
buying hundreds and 500,

139
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,730
600 and,

140
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,633
and uh,

141
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,650
I didn't realize it at the time.

142
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:35,710
The Guy I was buying from
was actually the main man.

143
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,320
And uh,

144
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,580
the big guy that started the
ecstasy hit the street in Dallas,

145
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,450
had been out here in west
coast for several years with
the therapist and all but

146
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,570
Dallas and the stork
club was the ground zero.

147
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,520
And the stork club was just stark.

148
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,321
Club was so big.

149
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:52,870
Madonna moved to Dallas
to be close to that club.

150
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,793
Why?

151
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,710
There's a documentary going
to be coming out soon,

152
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,850
called the stark project.

153
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,073
And uh,

154
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,970
it was an insane place.

155
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:01,480
It's really the,

156
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,540
the genesis of house music before,

157
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,550
or even Chicago is
called Stark club music.

158
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,680
And then it in and there were bowls
of ecstasy on the bar where you go by,

159
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:11,980
you know,

160
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,090
giving 20 bucks and get a,

161
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,580
get a hit because it was all legal and uh,

162
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:15,761
you know,

163
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:16,594
they had chill space.

164
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,000
It was a crazy place that you,

165
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,010
it was like burning man in a building.

166
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,001
In fact,

167
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:23,570
Larry Hagman was a regular there.

168
00:04:23,571 --> 00:04:23,740
And,

169
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,071
and,

170
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:24,191
uh,

171
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,530
in,

172
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,840
in this movie that's coming out,

173
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,640
he's quoted as saying he
lights up and he said,

174
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,091
oh,

175
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:30,340
it was the greatest party on earth.

176
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:30,631
He says,

177
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:32,080
the only better party is burning man,

178
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:34,300
but that's like putting the stork
club in the middle of a desert.

179
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,480
But some people would get all dressed up
burning man type and we're talking name

180
00:04:39,481 --> 00:04:40,211
brand people,

181
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:40,610
you know,

182
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,350
the talking heads and people like that.

183
00:04:42,351 --> 00:04:44,620
And Madonna even w showed up,

184
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,760
George W dot ben there.

185
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:46,720
And uh,

186
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,560
it was just wild and crazy and they played
this house music and they had a chill

187
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:52,750
space and coed bathrooms.

188
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,100
It's just a wild place.

189
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,080
And uh,

190
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,440
that's,

191
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,730
that's really where
ecstasy started spreading.

192
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,030
Now I was selling to
all of my friends and,

193
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,400
and a lot of coworkers and everybody.

194
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,540
And we were really serious about it that
I would make people read all whatever

195
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,590
literature there was,

196
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:08,831
you know,

197
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:09,850
there wasn't very much.

198
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:10,541
So there's a speech.

199
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:14,380
Sasha gave a talk that Rick Doblin
had given up the international,

200
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,520
a health organization,

201
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:16,151
but not much.

202
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:19,750
But we were really serious and I
was sort of not in the club scene.

203
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:22,120
I was getting people together
in small groups and doing it.

204
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:26,110
But I sold a lot of ex and I was getting
deep discounts and so I was using that

205
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:27,700
money to cash flow of my business.
