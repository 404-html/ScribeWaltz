1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,780
Try by day Joe Rogan podcast by night
all day.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,050
Cause that's a fighter dude.
It's a very dangerous sport.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,690
I see any glimpse where I can get an
advantage.

4
00:00:09,691 --> 00:00:12,530
I'm fucking like floyd mayweather and
victoire teas.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,400
I know that.
I have no problem with that.

6
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:15,890
Was that to me was fucked up.
It's,

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,880
oh,
it's a fight.

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,290
He came by.
He came up and said,

9
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:20,124
hey man,
sorry.

10
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,990
I already said sorry twice and he goes,
come on man.

11
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,230
That's bullshit.
Bullshit.

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,620
Bullshit.
I'll tell you what it was Victoria's,

13
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:30,030
he's at a mental breakdown.
Yup.

14
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,540
He was succumbing to the pressure.
He was fouling floyd had these head

15
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:38,100
headbutting him and he got penalized for
it when he got penalized for it.

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,870
He wanted to make friends with floyd and
in the making friends part like,

17
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:43,950
I'm sorry bro.
Look,

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,810
a lot of times you can't have that in a
fight.

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,660
You can't have that in a fight because
of the disruption of your focus.

20
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,210
It's adding in this emotional connection
with this person.

21
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:52,710
Now this person is your buddy.
Okay,

22
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,970
we're Bros were bros.
Right?

23
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:57,870
Let's go back to Friday.
Pepe boys like fuck you right hand,

24
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,820
go to sleep.
You know cheese is known for that

25
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,050
breaking.
Yes.

26
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,260
Well she got knocked up by Berto.
Cold blooded.

27
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,030
Yeah man,
I think he's done right.

28
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:07,050
He,
it seems like it should be.

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,410
I think like,
it seems like when he got really famous

30
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,860
and things started taking off,
like didn't he did dancing with the

31
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:15,360
stars movies?
Yeah,

32
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:16,700
the expendable.
He's doing well.

33
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,320
W against Berto the first five rounds
like shit,

34
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:21,450
here he is.
Cause you remember they built him up as

35
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:24,750
the next Oscar de la Hoya.
He was like the golden boy and then it

36
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,620
just never worked out.

37
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,220
Two fights.
I want to see us Golovkin Canelo and I

38
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:34,221
want to see a Kovalev Andre Ward.
Kovalev and Andre is going to be crazy.

39
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,000
It's happening for sure.
Yeah.

40
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:37,570
That's happening.
I can't wait for,

41
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:40,170
Andre Ward is so smart.
He just has to fight more.

42
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:43,530
He's so smart.
But that might have viva nef might not

43
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:45,750
be enough against Calvillo the Max so
hard.

44
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:48,090
Well he's not just so he's skillful as
fuck.

45
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,390
[inaudible] yeah.
[inaudible] and he's father at all.

46
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,800
No,
it doesn't give a fuck.

47
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,010
How about uh,
and it's kind of stupid talk about but

48
00:01:56,011 --> 00:01:57,750
it has legs.
Floyd Mayweather,

49
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,300
conor Mcgregor,
you don't,

50
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,500
and if we know,
we know cause didn't have any legs,

51
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,050
it kind of does.
It does.

52
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,380
It kind of does.
You know why?

53
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,210
Because Floyd wants it.
It doesn't matter.

54
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,850
New Ufc,
he's not going to let it happen.

55
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,290
But see I the only reason why I disagree
with you there is because Dana goes,

56
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,210
if floyd wants to make that fight
happen,

57
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,220
call me.
Dana is a businessman.

58
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,590
They care about money.
No big.

59
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,870
That fight would be how much money do
you think they could make if floyd

60
00:02:21,871 --> 00:02:25,410
mayweather fights conor mcgregor biggest
biggest paper you of all time?

61
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,750
No,
you don't think so?

62
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,240
[inaudible]

63
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,360
it might be.
What do you know the biggest draw

64
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:38,340
already in UFC mma where there's the
biggest paper,

65
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:41,010
you draw a box in both time.
You mixed the world.

66
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,080
Everyone would tune in,
including your dad.

67
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,130
I would say you telling me you wouldn't
tune in now because I was so full of

68
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,510
Shit.
You should very uninteresting to in two

69
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:54,150
hits instead of the little baby fairy
eyes turning fight.

70
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,540
No,
it's fascinating.

71
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,374
I spark.
Okay,

72
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,561
so,
so what,

73
00:02:57,561 --> 00:03:01,000
what happened was floyd mayweather would
box with conor mcgregor and basically

74
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:02,350
move around and be like,
all right,

75
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:04,870
here goes and it'd be a spectacle.
It's just not a fight.

76
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,710
It wouldn't be a fight where you are
fucking party pooper.

77
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,030
The guy.
Yes.

78
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:10,970
And in our cheer.
Yes.

79
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,000
This is the thing you gotta remember
though.

80
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,200
The one thing that Dana and floyd
mayweather who would be responsible in

81
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:18,930
this fight together and conner for the
matter,

82
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,700
all they care about is money and
numbers.

83
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,180
That fight would be money and fucking
numbers.

84
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:26,740
It would break pack.
Y'All may with a canteen.

85
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,161
Okay.
I know,

86
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:29,230
but what I'm saying is that,
how would,

87
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,980
how would they,
how would that fight,

88
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,510
what would they do and that fight?
So floyd probably can knock them out

89
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:35,470
anytime he wanted,
right?

90
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,090
No,
no.

91
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,040
Connor has a very good shin.
Um,

92
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,990
I mean,
kind of got knocked out by Nate Diaz or

93
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:44,020
he got knocked down and hurt Walden
wobbled by Nate Diaz.

94
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,360
Yeah.
Little gloves.

95
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:48,940
First of all,
nate's really good puncher needs a big

96
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:49,930
guy,
a nate.

97
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,150
Nate's fought at one seven and he's a
lot bigger than floyd.

98
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:53,660
Like physically alive.
Yeah,

99
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,730
but floyd is a guy who's broken his
hands many,

100
00:03:57,731 --> 00:04:02,080
many times and he's not known for like
really uncorking all of his might and

101
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:04,150
try to knock guys out knockout artists
in the least bit.

102
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,670
But he could,
he certainly could.

103
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,850
You know it's not,
the floor doesn't hit real hard but when

104
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:14,650
you box real smart knockouts come,
the opportunity comes like the Ricky

105
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,940
Hatton fight.
That's a perfect example.

106
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,880
That knockout came,
it's not like he went looking for the

107
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:21,220
victor of tease five.
Victor just fucked up and he just left

108
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:23,960
hook right hand dumb and he was,
he was a total sucker punch.

109
00:04:23,961 --> 00:04:27,160
Like you had no idea what was going on.
The weather has issues against gay,

110
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,970
like May Donna,
if you suggest the first second fight,

111
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,560
he box the shit out of him.
But if may dial it,

112
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:35,950
like if,
if,

113
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,500
if I was college coach in that fight
were to happen,

114
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,251
I'm like,
hey man,

115
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:41,710
don't be pretty and sit on the outside
and hit this guy.

116
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,540
We make this a dog bite.
You're the bigger guy.

117
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,530
You think connor would actually give
floyd mayweather a boxing match?

118
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,820
Is that what I'm hearing?
No,

119
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,580
that's not,
wasn't anybody saying no,

120
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,620
this thing,
the thing you're saying,

121
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,760
he's the biggest draw.
I'm saying that I don't think floyd

122
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,540
would just go out and try and knock them
out in the first round.

123
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,300
He'd box.
I think you would canelo Alvarez him,

124
00:04:58,301 --> 00:04:59,290
but he's,
you know,

125
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,690
obviously Canelo's way more skillful and
boxing.

126
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:04,810
Yeah.
I mean Canelo is a world champion.

127
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:06,880
One Punch knockout artists,
boxer.

128
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:09,880
I mean that fucking Amir Khan knockouts.
Hey Jesus.

129
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:14,910
Louisa was a super fucking home run on
the button to floyd got hit.

130
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,360
He said after he got,
when he fought Canelo,

131
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:23,740
he got punched in the thigh by Canelo,
had trouble walking for two days.

132
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:26,710
He literally creeks that he's,
he didn't show it at the fight.

133
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:27,221
He was like,
dude,

134
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:30,130
my thigh,
he punched me in the thigh so hard.

135
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,780
I am having trouble walking.

136
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,050
That's why floyd was never going to
fight mma.

137
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,870
Cause if connor would fucking break his
legs like literally mma,

138
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,110
that it would be discussed.
The more embarrassing than conner doing

139
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:44,770
just box way more than you would get.
Way more embarrassing because common is

140
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:48,220
a big guy.
Employed would have to like Bach smart

141
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:51,850
out in connor.
I think connor would have just

142
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,670
unbelievably difficult time even coming
close to hitting him.

143
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,200
I mean,
I think he's going to have straight

144
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,690
boxing with tying grades and stuff.
He's probably,

145
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,770
yeah,
you're talking about if not the greatest

146
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:02,450
boxer of all time and his defense is
good.

147
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,700
It would be a great show.
Say Good.

148
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,430
It'd be the best defense ever.
But for sure.

149
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,020
WHO's gets defensive?
Offensive Floyd.

150
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,530
And now you're taking a guy who is an
elite strike in the UFC,

151
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:14,810
but boxing's a different game,
