1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,150
You don't blizzard in world of Warcraft,

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,200
I don't know the exact numbers,

4
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:08,190
but they had released a pet whereas it
was like 25 actual dollars or something

5
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:11,220
like that and their servers
wound up getting crashed
and people lining up to buy

6
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:13,200
it just for like one little pet.

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,600
That's the power of those goods they've
figured out how to do is make it so that

8
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:19,830
the more you play the game,

9
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:21,000
the better you get,

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,470
the better your life is,

11
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:23,640
the more successful you are,

12
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:24,660
the more powerful you are,

13
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,040
the better the experiences,

14
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,230
the more you have controller
of the people in the game.

15
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,000
And that's like the really trippy thing.

16
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:32,970
It's like it's a time thing
they like locked you in.

17
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:33,571
Like it's,

18
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:34,320
it's like it's a,

19
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,340
it's a show that you're totally hooked
on and it never ends and it keeps getting

20
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:40,250
crazier everyday new people and they,

21
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:40,700
any,

22
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,790
any blizzard,

23
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,610
mark my words has created this mold that
so many other people in the business

24
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:45,150
you're going to follow.

25
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:45,601
We got this,

26
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:46,140
uh,

27
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:46,971
this thing and the new gear.

28
00:00:46,971 --> 00:00:49,680
So we have a calendar and it's
like you play gears and it's like,

29
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:50,370
Oh hey,

30
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:50,611
you know,

31
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:53,670
don't trade in your game because in two
weeks there's like ticker Tuesday or

32
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:54,670
triple XP Thursdays.

33
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:54,931
Right?

34
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:57,660
And then your friends are playing on
that same day and you want to keep going.

35
00:00:57,661 --> 00:00:57,961
Right.

36
00:00:57,961 --> 00:00:59,430
And maybe there's like
a psychology strict.

37
00:00:59,431 --> 00:00:59,971
There were like,

38
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:00,570
you know,

39
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,150
you don't sell the game because you're
thinking there might be something coming

40
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:03,331
up,

41
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:03,601
right.

42
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:06,540
We're dungeon masters and we're always
like manipulating that experience online

43
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:07,380
to have new shit happen.

44
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:08,701
Yeah.

45
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,980
It's kind of crazy that it
just keeps going though.

46
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,940
But I mean your average person have
over their life to a world where he can

47
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:17,100
start gaining that control.

48
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,600
That's like the biggest problem.

49
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,680
Like when you're young,

50
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:21,330
it's figuring out what you
want to do when you grow up.

51
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,081
Right?

52
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:22,761
Like thanks that.

53
00:01:22,761 --> 00:01:24,300
Thankfully I was lucky and I saw games.

54
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:24,571
I was like,

55
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:24,841
boom,

56
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:25,750
that right.

57
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,940
But so I've talked to kids who are like,

58
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:28,950
I'm going to school and I
don't know what I want to do.

59
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:29,161
It's like,

60
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:29,520
dude,

61
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,220
pick something and be surgical about it
and decide that you're going to be the

62
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:33,054
best at that.

63
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,520
We'd put the problem is finding something.

64
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:36,360
For a lot of kids,

65
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:37,920
the real issue is finding something.

66
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:38,701
Then you got lucky.

67
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:39,271
I got lucky.

68
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:40,104
A lot of people did,

69
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,050
but it's like it's very difficult
to find the thing that you're into.

70
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:43,331
You know?

71
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:44,250
You don't want to like say,

72
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:44,401
oh,

73
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:45,240
it's going to be this,

74
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:48,040
and then you're doing it and then halfway
into it you're like this fucking blog.

75
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,220
And so it's difficult to
find what that thing is.

76
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:51,054
It's like anchoring,

77
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,750
asking it a young,

78
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,130
especially the young
age when you don't know,

79
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,380
you hardly know a lot about what's
going on in the world around you.

80
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,423
But at the same time,

81
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,160
that opportunity now with the
internet is greater than ever,

82
00:01:59,580 --> 00:01:59,881
right?

83
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:01,320
Like you could shoot a viral video,

84
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,880
you could start a podcast,

85
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:03,481
you could do anything.

86
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:04,800
And if you start getting
better and better at it,

87
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:05,611
you can build community,

88
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:05,851
right?

89
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:06,870
If that's what you want to do.

90
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:08,130
But what if you want to be a carpenter?

91
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:09,540
Or what if you want to be a painter?

92
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,090
You know there's,

93
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,370
there's so many for kids,

94
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:13,470
the hardest thing is finding the thing,

95
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,060
finding whatever the fuck it is.

96
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:15,270
Like,

97
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,541
you know,

98
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:19,920
most kids don't get enough exposure to
interesting ideas between the schoolwork.

99
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,430
When you,

100
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,270
when you go to school,

101
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,260
when you think about what you've gotta do,

102
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:24,480
you've gotta get up at fucking
seven o'clock in the morning.

103
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,201
You've got to leave,

104
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:27,090
catch a bus with a bunch
of other Douche bags,

105
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,040
do a bunch of shit that sucks all day.

106
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,680
Listen to a bunch of people tell you
never gonna make anything out of your life

107
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:32,850
unless you pay attention to them.

108
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,361
And they're like,

109
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:33,841
listen bitch,

110
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:34,800
you're teaching school.

111
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:35,730
I know you don't make any money.

112
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:36,421
Shut the fuck up.

113
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:37,220
Don't you love?

114
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:37,610
Oh,

115
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:38,910
life was so great when you're a kid.

116
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:41,070
Like no answered moments,

117
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:41,670
but it sucked.

118
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,790
So to find something that you truly
love in the midst of all this,

119
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,940
like programming is what school
is no more than programming.

120
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:49,470
It is education.

121
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:51,490
There is information that
you're going to download it,

122
00:02:51,491 --> 00:02:52,410
you're going to remember it,

123
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,460
but the reality of what it is is getting
you program to get used to doing things

124
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:57,300
you don't want to do.

125
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,350
Listening to people that
you don't want hear,

126
00:02:59,380 --> 00:02:59,921
you're around people.

127
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:01,170
You don't want to be
around the New Yorker.

128
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,053
There's a buzzer.

129
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,080
Why?

130
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,630
Why does it have to be a buzzer stupid?

131
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,810
Was it so important that we fucking leave
at a certain time and get there at a

132
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:08,440
certain time?

133
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,790
You're turning me into a robot.

134
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,970
You know you're turning me into some
worker asshole that just goes and does the

135
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:17,110
same God damn thing everyday and providing
order for a certain mind that might

136
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:18,460
otherwise to either the default,

137
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:18,750
but again,

138
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,960
there's ways to educate.

139
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,770
Like my favorite hobbies,

140
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,110
if I'm out with friends and I was out in
San Francisco with a buddy and he had a

141
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:26,800
date,

142
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,270
who is this a public school teacher at?

143
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:31,450
Anytime I find one of my polar sound
like American memory by your drink and it

144
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:33,390
will just sit there and pick their
brain for like an hour about.

145
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,450
My uncle's a public school teacher.

146
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:35,290
Does he have horror stories?

147
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,100
Oh of course.

148
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,431
Right.

149
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:37,270
Teachers in New Jersey.

150
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,193
Yeah.

151
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,900
Like you know like classes that are huge,

152
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:41,800
like kids who are young,

153
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,620
like super young hooking up and bathrooms
and have to call child protective

154
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:45,040
services.

155
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,251
It's a,

156
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:46,510
it's a horror story out there.

157
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:46,961
Well,

158
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:47,321
you know,

159
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:49,720
they're all doing crazy shit
now too because of the Internet.

160
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:50,381
You know,

161
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:52,540
you hear like 13 year
olds are talking about,

162
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:52,691
you know,

163
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:53,830
making out one of the girls.

164
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,870
There was no girls making out
with girls when I was 13 there.

165
00:03:56,871 --> 00:03:57,970
Shit never took place.

166
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,411
They're all doing it.

167
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:00,244
You know,

168
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,260
13 year old girls.

169
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:02,590
Yeah.

170
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,010
That was the,

171
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,900
that I was 13 I knew
a lot of 13 year olds,

172
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:05,121
dude.

173
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:06,370
And none of them were
making out with each other.

174
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,060
Everybody would,

175
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,520
let's say they were going to do something
and you never know quite what it was.

176
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:09,731
Right.

177
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:12,570
And there was this kind of like a Dell
conspiracy to keep like pornography or

178
00:04:12,571 --> 00:04:13,391
away from you and things like that.

179
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:15,010
You had to go in the woods and find porn.

180
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:18,550
We've talked about this a hundred times
in the pod for meaning finding Portland

181
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:19,160
in the woods.

182
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,380
Yeah.

183
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,081
It's so funny.

184
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:21,790
Everyone's got the same story,

185
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:22,160
everybody.

186
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,840
It was incredible.

187
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,730
The dirty stuff.

188
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,480
We didn't bring this up to
you and everyone has the
same goddamn story and the

189
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:28,721
woods.

190
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:29,570
We find a magazine.

191
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:31,420
You shouldn't make an adult
bookstore in the woods.

192
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:32,680
It would probably be the most successful.

193
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,380
Just don't even tell him any signs.

194
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,050
Here's like a Johnny Porno Ct.

195
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:40,300
It looks like Ron Jeremy and a thong going
through with a giant sack of porn and

196
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:43,200
it's like Cherry Cherry.

197
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,063
Yeah,

198
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,970
it's not playboy.

199
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:49,180
It's the dirtiest shit you could find
was the bad stuff we grew up with.

200
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,301
Oh,

201
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:49,800
your dog.

202
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:49,891
Oh,

203
00:04:49,891 --> 00:04:50,230
there we go.

204
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,580
It was always penthouse
with a lot of water damage.

205
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,680
The girls look like that.

206
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,030
The SARLACC pit down there.

207
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:55,870
It was horrible.

208
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:56,230
Right,

209
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,830
and you're young,

210
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,491
impressionable mind.

211
00:04:57,491 --> 00:04:57,701
It's like,

212
00:04:57,701 --> 00:04:58,211
oh my God,

213
00:04:58,211 --> 00:04:59,230
I'm supposed to think this is hot.

214
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,150
What is going on here?

215
00:05:00,151 --> 00:05:00,281
Right.

216
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:01,114
It was terrifying,

217
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,070
but that's click of a button.

218
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:03,851
You can see two girls,

219
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:04,684
one cup.

220
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:05,823
Yeah.

221
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,320
We've talked about this
before about how crazy it is,

222
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:10,390
how how close all this stuff is.

223
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,640
Like someone could send you a Twitter
link and you click on it and just give to

224
00:05:13,641 --> 00:05:15,000
be the most horrible thing.

225
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:15,701
My words,

226
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:16,840
if I ever have children,

227
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,160
like they were not going to get a cell
phone until they're maybe 13 yeah.

228
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:24,850
But you know what the worst thing you
want to have is an uninformed kid.

229
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,390
True,

230
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,223
true.

231
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,280
Talk to them and just let them be
in the same flow as everybody else.

232
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,090
It's just to let them know what the
fuck is going on while it's out.

233
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,310
As long as that basis there.

234
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:36,790
Right?

235
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,181
Yeah.

236
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:38,000
Yeah.

237
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,390
Look,

238
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:38,650
you know,

239
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,800
there's that old expression,

240
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,900
the kids are going to be all right.

241
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:41,651
You know,

242
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:42,670
and there they are.

243
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,510
They're going to be all right.

244
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,201
They're going to be fine.

245
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:44,471
She's like,

246
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:44,921
we're fine.

247
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:45,850
We're worried about them.

248
00:05:45,851 --> 00:05:46,121
You know,

249
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:50,950
and I have little daughters and
logically I can say this and of course,

250
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:54,130
you know paternally I just want to protect
them and nerf the fucking world and

251
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:54,610
all that.

252
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,380
But I understand where that's coming from.

253
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,560
These kids going to be fine.

254
00:05:57,561 --> 00:05:59,350
They're growing up with other
human beings to some extent.

255
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,190
You want them to make their own mistakes.

256
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:01,461
Right?

257
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,241
I've known parents,

258
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:02,810
yes.

259
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,890
Pad The house of too much,

260
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:04,161
and it's like,

261
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:05,450
let him fall over once in a while.

262
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:06,680
Let them learn how balance.

263
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:06,921
Right.

264
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:07,160
Like,

265
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,430
well,

266
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,851
yeah,

267
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:08,570
but you know,

268
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,500
you gotta be careful.

269
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,021
You don't want them to,

270
00:06:10,021 --> 00:06:10,260
I mean,

271
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,093
kids die,

272
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:11,451
you know,

273
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:14,130
they don't have a coal stove in
the middle of the living room.

274
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:14,261
Right?

275
00:06:14,261 --> 00:06:14,481
Yeah.

276
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:14,931
But I mean,

277
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:16,130
if you have hard floors,

278
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:16,401
you know,

279
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:17,570
like I have marble floors.

280
00:06:17,571 --> 00:06:18,404
It's kind of tricky.

281
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:18,921
You know,

282
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,480
you've gotta you gotta watch them,

283
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,050
but,

284
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:21,771
but that's not the point.

285
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:22,490
The point is,

286
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:22,940
um,

287
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,030
you know what these are,

288
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:26,300
they're growing up with other people.

289
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:28,100
And I think p things always get better.

290
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,050
And even though it
seems like Shit's worse,

291
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,720
he didn't know that.

292
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,980
It seems like Shit's worse as far as like
the economy and all this craziness as

293
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:36,380
far as invasion of privacy and you know,

294
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:36,910
and uh,

295
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:37,100
the,

296
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,471
the,

297
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:37,760
you know,

298
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,910
the access to information that we have
and they're getting inundated with images

299
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:43,820
and videos and all this shit that we
didn't see until we were well mature.

300
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,193
They're going to be fine.

301
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:45,741
They're just,

302
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:46,790
this is how they're growing up now.

303
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,620
This is just how it is
and we're just the law,

304
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,690
the old people that are
just like our parents,

305
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:50,961
like,

306
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:52,160
oh kids these days looking at,

307
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:52,300
um,

308
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:52,480
yeah,

309
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,990
it's the same video games.

310
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,710
It's the same thing.

311
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,790
It's just we're like,

312
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,700
we're like kids these days with
their fucking ass to mouth porn.

313
00:06:59,090 --> 00:06:59,421
You know,

314
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:01,550
they got asked to mouth porn
on their fucking iPhone.

315
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:01,641
Well,

316
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:02,421
that's just what it is.

317
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:06,200
It's just this is the new world and the
world constantly keeps getting more and

318
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:07,670
more complex world of ass to mouth.

319
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,330
It's,

320
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,670
the world is always getting
more and more fucked up.

321
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,200
It's always getting more complicated,

322
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:13,760
more strange or bizarre.

323
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,040
Is it going to the Zombie
apocalypse is the default.

324
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:16,730
It's always,

325
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:16,940
look,

326
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,890
I think as long as there's
freedom of information,

327
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:21,590
the way we were expressing each other
right now and communicating with each

328
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:21,890
other,

329
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,630
people are gonna be able to
figure out things quicker.

330
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,081
You know,

331
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:27,920
and I think kids are going to be
able to figure out this multifaceted,

332
00:07:27,921 --> 00:07:32,820
fucked up chaotic world far quicker than
some fucking doofus from 1963 and now

333
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,810
he takes some kid from 1963 you could
talk him into anything they didn't know

334
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:36,540
shit.

335
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,360
You know today kids are
going to be more savvy,

336
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:38,961
more aware,

337
00:07:38,961 --> 00:07:39,850
more installation.

338
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,510
Ask anybody anything anymore.

339
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,560
Yeah,

340
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:42,950
fuck it up.

341
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,640
You can find it in the act was
complaining about this actually he was a,

342
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:47,840
there was a Steve Wasniak,

343
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:50,270
one of the creators of apple was doing
an interview where he cited saying,

344
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,291
back in my day,

345
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:51,501
you know,

346
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:52,070
you had a,

347
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,030
if you will add a question,

348
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:54,620
you had to find a smart
person and ask them,

349
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,970
well that's dumb.

350
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:56,990
Why would I,

351
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,280
why are you complaining about that?

352
00:07:58,281 --> 00:07:59,800
There's not that many
fucking smart people,

353
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,610
but I've got to seek out one dude.

354
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,600
That's retarded.

355
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:04,100
I have to go and talk to the professor.

356
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,410
That's why they're so God damn
arrogant about their information.

357
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:07,161
Think about the Mayans,

358
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:07,361
right?

359
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,450
What they used to control them by the,

360
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:08,731
you know,

361
00:08:08,731 --> 00:08:08,781
the,

362
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:09,710
all the quote priests,

363
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:09,981
you know,

364
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:10,370
figure it out.

365
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:10,700
Science.

366
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,121
I figure it out.

367
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:11,331
You know,

368
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:11,751
how the,

369
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:11,900
uh,

370
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,111
you know,

371
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:14,050
the lunar cycles and how everything
would turn out and think.

372
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:14,481
Everyone was like,

373
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:14,721
wow,

374
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:15,351
how do they know this?

375
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:16,071
It must be magic.

376
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:18,020
Or like we're controlling
this through knowledge,

377
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:18,800
right?

378
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,131
Yeah.

379
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:19,600
Well there's,

380
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:19,830
yeah,

381
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,140
but now the Egyptians to,

382
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:23,090
before the library of
Alexandria burned down,

383
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,830
they had,

384
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,920
I mean that was the idea as well.

385
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,220
They kept all the knowledge,

386
00:08:26,221 --> 00:08:27,250
they had all this information,

387
00:08:27,251 --> 00:08:31,010
but all sorts of different things
that the lay person was unaware of so

388
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:31,761
everybody can get it.

389
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,091
Google,

390
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:32,720
bitch.

391
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,381
Damn you.

392
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:35,720
We used to have to seek out
a Tim Sweeney or John Carmax,

393
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:36,531
right.

394
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:38,350
And hang on to the right of up to the top.

395
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,021
That's true.

396
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:43,040
Now there's just fucking a computer
connection to the Internet and all your

397
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:43,791
questions answered.

398
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:44,541
But it's not always true,

399
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:44,720
dude.

400
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:44,951
Not,

401
00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:45,110
oh,

402
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,850
that's a thing.

403
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,880
But it's getting there.

404
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,440
It released sitting closer and closer.

405
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:49,310
It's getting to the point.

406
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,930
There's a lot of disinformation,

407
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,610
but there's also a lot of information.

408
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:56,040
There's a lot of good information
and I think that's because I think it

409
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,890
developed it just like we need to be
able to discern between bullshit and

410
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:00,030
reality in the real world.

411
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,480
You need to be able to discern between
bullshit and reality online and people

412
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:05,040
will sort it all out and figure it out.

413
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,491
You know,

414
00:09:05,491 --> 00:09:06,001
if you know,

415
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:06,900
there's a lot of people that have it,

416
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:09,000
there's a lot of urban myths about
all sorts of different things.

417
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:09,330
You know,

418
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,620
if you drink a coke and take,

419
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:11,220
you know,

420
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:11,641
you know,

421
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:13,020
fucking this with it,

422
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:13,711
you'll die.

423
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:14,130
You know the,

424
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:14,341
I mean,

425
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:15,420
how many different stories,

426
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,660
if we ever heard when they need
just go online approx growing up.

427
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,051
Yes,

428
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:19,470
that's right.

429
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,200
That's what it was.

430
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,450
It was Mikey from the life cereal
commercial dye to stomach explodes,

431
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,760
right where there was their religion
about the girl that stuck a hot dog in her

432
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:28,230
pussy and then had to go to the hospital.

433
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:28,750
You never heard that one?

434
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,401
Didn't hear that one.

435
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:30,330
That was the other one there.

436
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:30,430
Right.

437
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,580
And the maggots were starting
coming out of your ass.

438
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,400
And then there's the one
about the lobster that right.

439
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:36,120
You heard that one right?

440
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,920
What was that one?

441
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,540
That girl apparently took
him off to the lab staff.

442
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,001
Lobster,

443
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:44,550
put it in here and then like lit a match
to it and make its tail flip around and

444
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:45,680
turns up the lobster had like,

445
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,670
like planted a bunch of eggs in her and
then three weeks later she died and all

446
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:49,850
that.

447
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:50,490
Yeah,

448
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,820
I could certainly see that some disgusting
girl was shit breath telling me that

449
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:54,270
story.

450
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:59,270
It really seems like life is going
towards like the having a matrix where you

451
00:09:59,311 --> 00:10:01,830
live in a bubble in
your whole life is like,

452
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,760
oh,

453
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,040
she took this labs fast.

454
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,140
He's fucking in that Plessy.

455
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,013
Right.

456
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,770
And it was all fucking loved.

457
00:10:11,771 --> 00:10:13,920
It just traps his eggs in a snatch.

458
00:10:13,921 --> 00:10:16,470
It was a lobster fest to
fucking lapse as a crime.

459
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:17,251
I have a pussy.

460
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:18,084
What a Hoe

461
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,490
[inaudible].
