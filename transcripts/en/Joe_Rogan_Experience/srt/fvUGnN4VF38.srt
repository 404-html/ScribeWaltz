1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,190
Three,
two,

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:05,723
one.

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,940
Jamie was giving us the,
the almost double of gun finger.

4
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:16,910
Not Yes.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,980
One Papa Sam's glasses.
You got a new look right now,

6
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,380
buddy just said fuck it.
While they're their uh,

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,840
their uh,
reading glasses dirty.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,330
They're dirty.
They're progressive's.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,700
What's that mean?
That means that the top.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,833
Oh,
look,

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,280
yes.
Three levels.

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,600
Oh,
far.

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,340
Medium reading.

14
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,640
Fuck Dude.
What are they going to fix?

15
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:41,200
That?
It's pretty good.

16
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,090
I fixed what your eyes?
Yeah.

17
00:00:43,091 --> 00:00:44,020
I only have,
um,

18
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,960
I have reading glasses that I've worn 
over the last few years,

19
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,960
like two or three years.
I think I hit like 46 and that's when it

20
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:54,820
just started going eee.
Like I'd look at my phone like,

21
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,860
hey,
why does that look like shit?

22
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,370
It really is bad.
And then Adam Carolla did my podcast and

23
00:01:00,371 --> 00:01:01,204
he left some glasses over who loved 
reading glasses and I picked up his 

24
00:01:04,301 --> 00:01:05,710
reading glasses and I put them on.
I went,

25
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:07,720
fuck,
I can see,

26
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,640
I can fucking see clear now.
I know it's really frustrating

27
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,003
and uh,
I can't wear contacts because I have a 

28
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:18,180
scar on this eyeball.
Low from A.

29
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,230
I don't know what from the only thing I 
can think of is he said it was something

30
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:23,064
as a child,
there was a pillow fight I had with my 

31
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:26,214
friend Keith in like third grade and I 
remember him hitting me in an open eye 

32
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,750
and just being down for awhile.
But just as kids,

33
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:34,230
you know,
you're like,

34
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,063
oh,
that hurt.

35
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,380
Right.
But you only thing I could.

36
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,041
Totally,
yeah,

37
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:41,010
there's a scar on the outer layer of my 
eyeball.

38
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,650
Can they do something about that?
And they like,

39
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,733
no,
I mean you can start messing with it 

40
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,620
with this guy is a really good eye 
doctor.

41
00:01:47,621 --> 00:01:49,800
And he's like,
don't mess with it if you don't have to.

42
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:51,660
But if I look through that,
I,

43
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,440
it's a little cloudy always even with 
the glasses.

44
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,240
So this one,
uh,

45
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,243
because of the little bumpy scar I can't
put a contact on so they'll go with the 

46
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:03,720
glasses.
But uh,

47
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,240
you say it's a new look when I don't 
have glasses on,

48
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,940
I just had these glasses for like two 
years.

49
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,280
But everyone I've

50
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,313
get used to people wearing glasses,
like greg fitzsimmons wears glasses and 

51
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:17,650
sometimes he doesn't wear glasses and 
I'm like,

52
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,650
Oh man,
what do you like better?

53
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,100
What's Tom Papa to you?
I just like you buddy.

54
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,760
Oh,
I don't really care if you wear glasses.

55
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,240
The glasses or the odd thing that makes 
girls sexy.

56
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,760
There's something about a girl wearing 
glasses.

57
00:02:33,761 --> 00:02:35,100
It's kind of sexy.
Yeah.

58
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,943
Worked in every eighties movie.
What's always like girls pulled up with 

59
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,360
their hair,
pulled up tight blouse,

60
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,670
a skirt,
dropping off papers.

61
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,960
Why is that?
I don't know.

62
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,870
A smart girl is sexy.
Yeah.

63
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,093
And then at the end of the movie takes 
it off and gets all slutty and lets her 

64
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:51,620
hair down.
Yeah.

65
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,530
Is it like an alternative thing?
Is that like what it is?

66
00:02:54,531 --> 00:02:56,980
Like you see the girl with the glasses 
and you like,

67
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:57,970
oh,
she's different.

68
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,920
She's out reading and

69
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,870
she's focused.
Yeah.

70
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,270
She's got her act together.
Shit,

71
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,410
what shouldn't be?
She'll be able to see my flaws.

72
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,303
Maybe she can help me.
She'll know if I really read those 

73
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:12,544
books.
I don't know if you think it's the same 

74
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:15,304
for kids now though,
because there's so many weird looking 

75
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:17,644
kids now.
Like when we were young it was like the 

76
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:22,510
glasses girl or like the blind girl,
that cheerleader girl.

77
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:26,350
Now everything's so much together.
You mean like what is attractive?

78
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,333
Just like the classifications of people.
We had like teams that you were a part 

79
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:35,401
of the job or the nerd or the burn out?
I was a jock and a class clown.

80
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,370
Oh you were a class clown.

81
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:43,683
But like,
but like I had a lot of friends because 

82
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:48,700
I was the class clown so it wasn't a,
it wasn't a douchey.

83
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,130
You just liked sports?
Yeah,

84
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:54,640
it was A.
I played football from kindergarten till

85
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:58,120
I graduated and then uh,
I was the captain.

86
00:03:58,121 --> 00:03:59,970
I was all league.
No shifts.

87
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,250
Spoil you.
Tom.

88
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,920
Papa.
I was a fullback.

89
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,610
How many a head collisions did you have?
Tons.

90
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,500
How's your head?
Fine.

91
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,810
Really?
Yeah.

92
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,980
I mean it all depends who you're playing
against.

93
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:12,814
You know what I mean?
Like we were a white suburban school 

94
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,960
running into other suburban kids that 
were going like this.

95
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,260
We played,
we played in a scrimmage.

96
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:24,730
PASSAIC,
passaic,

97
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,010
New Jersey is like one of the big 
cities,

98
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:30,220
you know,
and they had ironhead heyward.

99
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,130
Remember that guy?
He went pro,

100
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:39,270
big man's giant man size black man from 
passaic and we scattered like deer.

101
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:45,304
Just we saw him coming after our all 
white league and then not just a black 

102
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:51,130
guy,
but like an ultimate job.

103
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,380
Oh my God,
look at this size of that guy.

104
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,390
He,
when you see them,

105
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,220
especially with football pads on the 
shoulder pads,

106
00:04:59,221 --> 00:05:00,600
you're like,
oh my God,

107
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,643
how big is that guy?
If they would just hand them the ball 

108
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,840
and just tell them to run straight,
what are you going to do about that?

109
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,153
That's so not fair.
That's why I think fighting is so much 

110
00:05:10,381 --> 00:05:12,750
safer because there's weight classes.
Yeah.

111
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,063
Like a dude like me and a guy like that 
should never be involved in an 

112
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:19,950
altercation.
Not Fair.

113
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,290
How big is he?
Oh,

114
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,830
he's only five slash 11 slash 65.
Jesus Christ so thick.

115
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:30,831
He's a tank from his back to his front.
On the side was probably six feet thick.

116
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:32,880
You have to be to be five slash 11 slash
65.

117
00:05:32,881 --> 00:05:33,714
That's what Mark Hunt is.
Mark Hunt the a kickboxer reference in 

118
00:05:36,181 --> 00:05:37,650
the UFC.
He's so sick.

119
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,060
He's like five,
10,

120
00:05:39,061 --> 00:05:40,620
five,
11 to 65.

121
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,483
Just a massive,
massive Samoan though he's the Super 

122
00:05:45,451 --> 00:05:46,284
Samoan,
like samoans in general are really 

123
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:51,120
powerful people.
It's just a thick people.

124
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,390
They are a durable,
powerful race of people.

125
00:05:54,391 --> 00:05:56,040
It's amazing because you need to think 
about it.

126
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,053
Those people,
the

127
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,813
and his island folk,
they were traveling in canoes back and 

128
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:04,790
forth across the oceans.
They probably.

129
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,820
It probably required severe physical 
strength.

130
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,760
Right?
But when you see Polynesians,

131
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:12,140
Hawaiians,
a lot of them,

132
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,100
they're fucking stout people.
Big Time Midi.

133
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,280
Well just like just solid built,
fucking powerful.

134
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,640
But there are big download too,
so when you're in a canoe,

135
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:26,474
you're just all upper body,
but they kind of carry those canoes to 

136
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:29,990
men.
You've got to carry stuff.

137
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:34,991
You're probably packing out your camps 
and running up hills and eating coconuts

138
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:36,890
with your feet.
Well,

139
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,760
how would you do that?
You hold the Samoans.

140
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:40,683
They were able to hold the canoes over 
their head and then pick up coconuts 

141
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,960
with their toes as they walked and bite 
it.

142
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,050
Like an apple.
No,

143
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:51,080
that's not true.
Almost had me son of a bitch.

144
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,201
I was like,
wow.

145
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:53,210
I was going over my head.

146
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,610
I was doing it like I was.
I was mimicking it.

147
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,460
Why would they put the commute down?
I mean,

148
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:00,260
how,
what kind of a hurry are they in that he

149
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:01,094
can't pick up on?
Looking at the whole thing was so 

150
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:05,330
confusing and then when you said bite it
like an APP on my.

151
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,340
He got me.
No,

152
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,120
but wow.
I was a kid playing football.

153
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:09,350
There was,
there was.

154
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,663
I kind of went between groups,
but there were the jocks and the 

155
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:15,284
burnouts where the kids get into high in
the back and then there were the band 

156
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:20,570
kids.
My kids are in school now.

157
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,020
They don't.
Those classifications don't really exist

158
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:25,880
anymore.
Yeah.

159
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:31,320
They're like Bros,
jocks and skaters and yet we're so old.

160
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,970
We shouldn't be talking about these 
kids.

161
00:07:32,971 --> 00:07:33,804
They're going to be mad like you don't 
even know what the fuck you're talking 

162
00:07:36,231 --> 00:07:36,470
about.

163
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,221
Old Man.
Well,

164
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:38,240
I literally.
Yeah,

165
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:39,640
because yeah,
I don't go to.

166
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,620
I'm not in seventh grade.
I got to ask questions and they don't.

167
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,780
A smart girls get high.
Wow.

168
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:53,530
A bookworm docs are in choir.
It's more acceptable to be yourself.

169
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,070
They grew up in a time when you could be
anything and do anything.

170
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,250
No one and no one shit on you for trying
things that real.

171
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:02,870
It's real.
That's amazing.

172
00:08:02,871 --> 00:08:04,400
If that's true.
It's totally true.

173
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,490
They have a whole different way of 
looking at the world.

174
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:08,324
They don't.
They look at the way we were raised as 

175
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,893
animals,
just saying the mean shit to other 

176
00:08:14,781 --> 00:08:19,781
people and people just shitting on you 
for trying anything that we look at that

177
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:21,914
like it's cavemen times feel like you 
would call someone fat what you would 

178
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:29,810
call someone retarded or gay or.
I mean all that stuff is,

179
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,030
you know,
it's a lot of word speak conversation,

180
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:32,864
but it's manifested itself into the way 
these kids were raised and they're 

181
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,430
sweeter and kinder.
Wow.

182
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:38,720
That's interesting.
Yeah.

183
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,650
That's so fascinating.
I know you got to see like real cultural

184
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:43,484
evolution because if you go back to the 
beginning of the 20th century and those 

185
00:08:47,571 --> 00:08:48,404
poor people that were surviving through 
the depression and you ever read any 

186
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:54,890
books on the depression,
Grapes of Wrath,

187
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,050
there was a

188
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,650
book,
I think it was called mcgurty.

189
00:08:59,100 --> 00:08:59,933
It was,
um,

190
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,953
by a guy named Bob Burns who's a famous,
a billiards historian and he wrote this 

191
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:06,234
book about a Pool Hustler during the 
depression that traveled literally by 

192
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:11,064
train car,
like a Hobo from town to town and found 

193
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:14,634
people to gamble with these bars and 
they would hustle and pretend they 

194
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:18,540
didn't play very well and lose a little 
bit of money.

195
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,500
And then when money,
you know,

196
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:20,820
that kind of it already.
Yeah.

197
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,770
But it was a really depressing book,
man.

198
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,470
Yeah.
Just people are suffering,

199
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:26,304
people are suffering.
And there was this one story where he 

200
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,993
was literally a knocking on this guy's 
house begging for food and the guy 

201
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,800
brought him out some sausage and you 
know,

202
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,673
and they had like a soup together and he
was just describing the food that this 

203
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:42,660
guy had given him.
And like how,

204
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:45,600
how wonderful it was and how amazing it 
was in that moment.

205
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,320
Like he was literally dying.
Like his body was giving out from hunger

206
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:54,480
in America,
in America in 1920 9:30

207
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,050
is that when the depression was official
in the stock market crash was 29.

208
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,350
It's so scary that the stock market is a
real thing.

209
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,333
Like I was.
I was trying to explain this to someone 

210
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:06,000
like what my frustration with it is 
because I was like,

211
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:07,620
okay.
He just looked at it this way.

212
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,830
Right?
I know if you're,

213
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,580
if you're a financial person,
you're like,

214
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:12,241
oh my God,
you're so,

215
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:14,130
let's do.
But I really think it works that way,

216
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,930
but this is what I'm saying.
If you look at the world and you look at

217
00:10:18,931 --> 00:10:21,480
all the people,
the number of people's tastes constant,

218
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,763
the resources stay constant.
Like there's kind of the same amount of 

219
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:25,764
metal as the same amount of silicon.
This is the same amount of all the 

220
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:31,260
different materials we use to make 
things.

221
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:32,803
The same countries are in place.
The monies to say what the fuck 

222
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,443
happened?
That all the sudden everything's 

223
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:39,024
terrible.
Like you had this state where like you 

224
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,280
have prosperity,
everything's wonderful,

225
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:47,400
people are doing great,
then the stock market crashes

226
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,663
and when the stock market crashes,
all these people lose their jobs and 

227
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:53,444
mortgage rates go get fucked up.
Everybody's fucked and this just like 

228
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,500
this terrible period of,
of,

229
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,830
of fear.
Right?

230
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:00,883
But meanwhile the earth is the same.
It's almost like we create these 

231
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,380
disasters,
we create these,

232
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,813
these systematic dislike in there like 
inside the system that we've created 

233
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:12,973
well as disaster and it's the.
It's the system that we've built to 

234
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:17,744
survive and be able to trade goods and 
food and homeless and the structure we 

235
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:28,190
built to live and be safe from the 
outside elements on this planet.

236
00:11:28,191 --> 00:11:30,500
Right?
So weird when that thing.

237
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:34,070
But that thing has to run and it runs by
money and money circulates.

238
00:11:34,071 --> 00:11:36,170
All that stuff all around,
all the time.

239
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,620
There's still money when all that stuff 
happens,

240
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,663
but it's up here clogged with these with
very select places and then the rest of 

241
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:45,914
the flow just stopped.
There's no more water coming to these 

242
00:11:47,631 --> 00:11:50,480
tributaries anymore that everybody goes 
tanking.

243
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,343
Such a goofy system.
You know what that feels like that like 

244
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:54,214
someone

245
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,580
took windows 95 and just kept upgrading 
it.

246
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,160
Right now we are in 2017 and we don't 
get a new operating system.

247
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,640
We get a new operating system for a 
fucking computer,

248
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:08,260
which is not really that God damn 
important.

249
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,453
All in all,
if you could choose between a good 

250
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:13,300
operating system for life,
have a much better,

251
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,980
more,
more updated operating system for,

252
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,270
for civilization or whether or not you 
could get online.

253
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,300
You Got Online and 95 you your shit 
would work.

254
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,183
Yeah.
You know,

255
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,700
what do you do when you're writing 
emails?

256
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,543
You checking your twitter,
how much time do you take online would 

257
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:29,830
work fine.
It would work size a web.

258
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:32,110
Browsers didn't crash.
You can go to the websites.

259
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,190
It's way more important to have a new 
operating system for life.

260
00:12:36,191 --> 00:12:37,750
We don't even touch that stupid thing.

261
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,470
You can't.
It's too massive.

262
00:12:39,471 --> 00:12:42,800
And what really bothers me,
and it's really been on my mind lately,

263
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,460
is that you can't escape the herd.
You can't,

264
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,440
can't right now,
like the.

265
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,530
Everything was really crashing in 2008.
I mean that scenario that you're talking

266
00:12:54,531 --> 00:12:57,990
about where everything just stopped like
all the top people were like,

267
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:02,150
the economy is grinding to a halt this 
afternoon,

268
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,973
that calamity right took everybody's 
savings and messed it up and all this 

269
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:11,030
stuff so now and everybody had to go 
through it.

270
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,343
Now things have kind of come back and 
they're coming back and there's this 

271
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:16,723
trump bump on the stock market.
Things are really going really high and 

272
00:13:20,571 --> 00:13:21,404
then some people think it's a bubble and
this is just a false thing and it's 

273
00:13:25,131 --> 00:13:25,964
going to crash,
and some people even say it's going to 

274
00:13:28,731 --> 00:13:32,270
crash worse than 2008 if things go 
really haywire.

275
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,880
My question is,
if we know that,

276
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,430
how do I get out of the way of the 
tsunami?

277
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,860
Why do I have to go with everybody else?
Can?

278
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,410
What can I do with my money where I can 
be safe from this,

279
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,010
these tides that take everybody?
That's a really good question,

280
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,070
but I think the question that 
overwhelmed that question is,

281
00:13:52,071 --> 00:13:53,930
why the fuck are we still doing it like 
this?

282
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,130
That seems to be a better question 
because this seems crazy.

283
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,260
How are you going to reboot it?
What are you going to do?

284
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,130
Just

285
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,000
are you.
You're right.

286
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,320
I don't know.
You're right.

287
00:14:03,321 --> 00:14:04,290
I don't have any.
I don't know.

288
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,880
I'm not fucking zero education and 
economics.

289
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,630
I know almost nothing about how all that
stuff

290
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,493
stuff works.
I did a show two weekends ago for these 

291
00:14:14,011 --> 00:14:16,800
financial people.
Really Fun show,

292
00:14:16,801 --> 00:14:18,210
you know?
It's like their private event.

293
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,283
I'm talking to them after after the show
at the bar we meet and greet kind of 

294
00:14:23,731 --> 00:14:28,731
thing and some of these guys who are our
age who are just economic guys,

295
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:29,963
they're in finance.
They start these conversations about 

296
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,453
buying and selling properties and 
shifting stocks and bonds and all this 

297
00:14:38,431 --> 00:14:42,240
and where did the bond market doing?
It's like they're speaking Chinese

298
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,080
and I felt like a 10 year old kid.
I'm like,

299
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:50,350
this is what the rich people talk about.
I wish I understood.

300
00:14:50,511 --> 00:14:51,980
Some of you know

301
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,813
what I mean.
You know what it's like to me it's like 

302
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:54,524
when someone starts bringing up like 
chess moves when we're talking about 

303
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,140
specific chess games,
like Kasparov playing some dude.

304
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:01,400
Yeah.
And then they start,

305
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,920
you know,
rook to king two or whatever the numbers

306
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:04,431
are on.
I'm like,

307
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:05,730
what,
what is he doing?

308
00:15:05,731 --> 00:15:07,500
Like,
what's happening in him?

309
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,010
I knew a guy and he went to prison and 
uh,

310
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:14,900
when he came out of prison he had 
learned to play chess in his head.

311
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,153
Oh my God.
So he could sit there and him and this 

312
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:20,050
kid,
there was this kid who is this.

313
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,070
It was a really,
really interesting guy.

314
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:24,320
It was really tiny kid that used to come
to this pool,

315
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:27,350
so super smart.
But he was like this little,

316
00:15:27,351 --> 00:15:28,184
like,
like almost like a fucking honeybadger 

317
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,480
probably funny kid pool where you can 
like pick fights with people.

318
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,800
And he was a tiny little guy,
was so little that people will be like,

319
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,200
why is this guy doing?
But anyway,

320
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:42,230
he was super fucking smart soup.
I guess he just felt,

321
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,980
yeah,
I felt like,

322
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,813
I guess he felt like he had establishes 
his place in the social pecking order 

323
00:15:47,301 --> 00:15:48,134
because you're so little.
It was a pool hall and he was a really 

324
00:15:50,031 --> 00:15:50,864
smart guy.
So I think it's tragic to yell at 

325
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:54,350
people.
Like one time he yelled at me,

326
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,870
Oh really?
Oh Man.

327
00:15:56,871 --> 00:16:00,660
He was probably like 15 or 16 and I was,
you know,

328
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,760
25.
I was like,

329
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,090
man,
like what are you crazy?

330
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:05,924
Like what are you doing?
I had to have a conversation with that 

331
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:08,840
dude.
I'm not your,

332
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,660
I'm not your enemy.
We're arguing over a pool game.

333
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,590
You know what's going on?
Yeah.

334
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,950
Don't say you're a take me outside and 
go listen to that.

335
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,050
How old are you?
And he goes,

336
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:18,710
like,
15th.

337
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,730
I go,
dude,

338
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,470
I'm not just listened.
I'm not,

339
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,453
I'm not your enemy.
We're trying to figure out who's right 

340
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,793
on a foul foul as foul is whether or not
like maybe a foot off while you're 

341
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,043
playing pool and maybe your,
your tip touch the ball before it was 

342
00:16:33,861 --> 00:16:34,694
supposed to and you try to ignore it and
then someone calls you on or the hit is 

343
00:16:37,971 --> 00:16:40,000
bad.
Like you don't hit the number ball.

344
00:16:40,001 --> 00:16:41,210
You're supposed to have your play nine 
ball.

345
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:42,350
The other guy's supposed to get ball in 
hand,

346
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,263
right?
If it's a competitive thing that a 

347
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:44,451
tournament,
those,

348
00:16:44,451 --> 00:16:46,970
those conversations get,
they get pretty emotional.

349
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:47,804
People got really upset.
Like I definitely did not fall because 

350
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:50,894
all of a sudden he was like trying to 
start a fight and how little we have 

351
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:54,590
tall was not big at all.

352
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,583
Okay.
And this was like right after I just 

353
00:16:57,471 --> 00:17:01,940
said I just maybe had my last fight and 
there's a couple of years before that,

354
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,720
so I was still kickbox and I was still 
training all the time and I was like,

355
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:06,554
this is the craziest conversation I 
can't believe I'm having with this 

356
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:10,160
little kid.
And so I pulled them outside.

357
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,510
I go,
we just had,

358
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,730
you know,
just kind of a down to earth,

359
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,400
you know,
you gotTa,

360
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:16,403
you know,
you got to get respect from these 

361
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:18,080
fucking people.
I go,

362
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,420
yeah,
not like someone's going to hit you.

363
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,621
Oh really?
Yeah,

364
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:22,454
you got to be.
So it was a planned thing because this 

365
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,453
fucking kid,
it was cool afterwards because I had 

366
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:27,854
this kind of conversation.
He knew that if we ever did have a 

367
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:33,680
conversation before,
I was never going to go to a bad place.

368
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,200
I was just going to talk to them.
Right.

369
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,150
So it made it a nice thing because he 
was a wizard.

370
00:17:38,151 --> 00:17:42,620
He's a really smart kid and,
and for pool is that I like,

371
00:17:42,621 --> 00:17:43,580
is that like chess?
Like.

372
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,091
Oh yeah,
yeah,

373
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:44,924
yeah,
yeah.

374
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,131
Vantage.
Yeah,

375
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:49,100
because you're also smart in the 
execution of your shot.

376
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:53,880
Like one of the things about pool is the
execution of your shots should be almost

377
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:56,610
effortless.
You rely on your structure,

378
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,743
you rely on your stance,
you rely on your technique and it's 

379
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:01,164
supposed to be like incredibly gentle 
and smart people can figure that out 

380
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:08,880
better than dumb people how to get.
Instead of slamming the ball,

381
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:12,480
instead of using your muscles,
instead they'd stroke the ball where the

382
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:14,490
weight of the queue is kind of doing all
the work.

383
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,563
The point is,
this kid was so fucking smart that him 

384
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:17,874
and that prison guy would get together 
and play chess in their head cheese and 

385
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,120
I would sit there like a stupid a pool.

386
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,540
They,
I sat there and I just pulled up a stool

387
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,090
and I just watched them playing chess in
there.

388
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:34,860
They went through a full game in their 
head.

389
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:36,240
I was like,
this is so crazy.

390
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,940
They know where all the pieces are.
So crazy.

391
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,220
That's what it was like with these 
financial guys.

392
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:42,780
It was like,
you know what?

393
00:18:42,781 --> 00:18:46,350
They're just smarter because even though
I was never that great in math,

394
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:47,850
I,
I could not have.

395
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,910
My head isn't built for talking about 
that stuff.

396
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,133
They're smarter in that area.
That is what it's like when you hear 

397
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:56,130
them talking.
It's like night to rook six.

398
00:18:56,131 --> 00:18:57,250
Like what,
where,

399
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,950
where is that?
What's happening?

400
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:00,270
Where's the grid?
I don't understand the grit,

401
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,880
but it's even more complex.
So they're talking about dividends,

402
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:03,923
bonds and fucking I know and they can 
make a lot of money because they just 

403
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:08,370
have that knowledge.

404
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,590
Sure.
And some of them start doing coke,

405
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,530
then they get crazy and leave their 
families.

406
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,820
Oh Man.
That's like a.

407
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,860
that's what business where people go off
the rails,

408
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,290
but like what can you do to protect 
yourself?

409
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,060
Say trump goes off the rails and the 
stock market goes down again.

410
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:25,893
What?
There's nothing you can do right now to 

411
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:29,070
prepare yourself for that.
Well,

412
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,500
you can put your money in cash,
but then it's not growing.

413
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,330
I think the amount of pressure that guys
under is probably unmanageable.

414
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,170
I think very few people can manage that 
pressure.

415
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,620
I think that job's insane.
I don't think it should be real.

416
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,440
I don't think it should be a job.
It should be five people.

417
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,170
It shouldn't be a ton of people.
Yeah.

418
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,130
I mean,
I think five people's enough.

419
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,600
I said I don't even know,
man.

420
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,463
I just.
I feel like it almost should be all of 

421
00:19:53,431 --> 00:19:54,210
us.

422
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,043
Yeah.
Well,

423
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:59,510
it just.
It seems like if you wanted to give your

424
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,780
reason,
you,

425
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,030
Tom,
papa wanted to give you a reasons why we

426
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:03,864
shouldn't be engaging in some sort of a 
military action against North Korea or 

427
00:20:06,361 --> 00:20:08,850
whatever's next.
You would have to do it.

428
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,160
You have to write it out or you'd have 
to record it,

429
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,100
right.
You'd have to give a coherent reason why

430
00:20:14,101 --> 00:20:15,710
you feel and that that,
that,

431
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,210
that would be considered.
So you'd be like one person,

432
00:20:18,211 --> 00:20:21,780
imagine if there's 350 million of us or 
whatever the hell it is.

433
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:25,830
Right now.
Everyone having single opinion,

434
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:26,893
a new wants to complex comprehensive 
opinion on any sort of an action that 

435
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:33,930
any thing in the government is doing 
that represents us.

436
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,040
That's what the government is.
I mean there's these people.

437
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:37,874
It's boiled down to a few people that 
are supposed to successfully represent 

438
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,443
us and all of our ideas,
but there's no way they could know what 

439
00:20:44,821 --> 00:20:45,990
our ideas are.
No,

440
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,070
but you can come close being like,
okay,

441
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,620
this my town,
if you go to Congress and be like,

442
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:53,800
my state really thinks weed should be 
legal.

443
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,630
You know,
the consensus sort of.

444
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,480
Yeah.
Sort of.

445
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:03,040
I don't know how accurate or inaccurate 
and in certain ways.

446
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,160
Right.
It's just,

447
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,340
it seems to me it is.
It is strange though.

448
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:11,341
I mean to be that president to be one 
guy and it really is a thing about,

449
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,810
you know,
there are huge guy,

450
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:18,811
there is one guy on the top of virgin or
tesla or but they know it's their job to

451
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:24,070
run things in.
Have people doing stuff for them?

452
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:29,071
It's almost a job that's more about 
poise and intelligence and patients than

453
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:31,414
it is like taking everybody's thing on.
That's what's so unsettling about the 

454
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:38,230
time right now.
You want someone,

455
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,123
you want dad to be at the steering wheel
and you feel good and safe in the back 

456
00:21:43,071 --> 00:21:43,570
seat.

457
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,403
Well,
that's why a lot of people are really 

458
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:45,934
excited about trump because he's 
confident and if you're a confident 

459
00:21:49,511 --> 00:21:54,511
older man who's successful people like 
there's a natural instinct like an Alpha

460
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:57,290
chimpanzees now it's an Alpha factor,
right?

461
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:58,203
It's a total.
There's a total instinct to try to 

462
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:04,330
acquiesce and also an instinct.
The challenge is to be a big instinct to

463
00:22:04,331 --> 00:22:05,164
challenge him because of who he is too,
and he sees weaknesses and see we can 

464
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,040
swipe out his ankle and it shouldn't 
exist.

465
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,350
Folks.
This is this,

466
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:17,140
this is highlighting what's wrong.
And everybody's like,

467
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:17,974
yeah,
you don't know anything about politics 

468
00:22:18,821 --> 00:22:20,230
and you're right.
I don't.

469
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,280
I know so little about politics.
There's a lot I don't know a lot about.

470
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:27,670
A lot of things does.
Nobody does,

471
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,050
but I know one thing I know that I can 
see patterns and trends.

472
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,273
I see them,
I'm pretty good at it and I see a 

473
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:40,441
pattern and trend in our communication,
in our expression of ideas.

474
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,700
It's like what you were talking about 
with kids today.

475
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,173
I'm not surprised by that at all and I'm
excited by it because I think that I 

476
00:22:46,811 --> 00:22:48,700
think that people are more openminded 
today.

477
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:49,270
They're,
they're,

478
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,730
they're way smarter than I was when I 
was their age.

479
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,370
If you talk to like an average 10 year 
old or 11 year old,

480
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,800
they know so much more about how the 
world works and I did when I was asking.

481
00:22:57,801 --> 00:23:01,840
The amount of work they have to do in 
school is 10 times what we had,

482
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,230
but they're still all being trapped by 
the same system,

483
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,570
which they still have the same 
educational system,

484
00:23:07,571 --> 00:23:08,404
which I think is fucking bananas.
You make kids go to school all day and 

485
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:13,360
then at the end of that you give them 
homework.

486
00:23:13,361 --> 00:23:17,230
How about fuck you?
How many hours in a day is there?

487
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:20,080
You're preparing people for suck,
but it's what you're doing.

488
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:21,490
Yeah.
My kids,

489
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,430
they were up til 11:00
at night doing work,

490
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,210
not hanging out,
not screw it around like fuck man.

491
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:31,000
Working.
That takes away your life life.

492
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,840
It's really important,
especially especially when it's a.

493
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,053
it's a curriculum in the public schools 
that is geared towards a manufacturing 

494
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:45,980
middleclass.
Now there's learning in that

495
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,200
way.
Learning like robots,

496
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,063
if you want these kids to,
they could work so much smarter about 

497
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,233
more uptodate teaching methods and 
things that are going to apply to get 

498
00:23:56,031 --> 00:23:58,010
jobs going out.
Then it's like,

499
00:23:58,011 --> 00:23:59,530
all right,
spend a little time on that door.

500
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:03,920
Also training people to put their energy
into things that don't bring them joy.

501
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:08,780
They're training a certain kind of 
discipline of certain kind of morose,

502
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:14,100
like dark gray cloud disciplined.
You're totally right to the factory with

503
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:18,180
a hammer.
Bang,

504
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,750
stay alive.
In order to stay alive,

505
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,910
we have to work.
Bang,

506
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,430
Bang,
Bang,

507
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,370
row those fucking boats across the ocean
in your kid like,

508
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,060
but wait,
I just want to board man.

509
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,170
Tony Hawk makes way more than you do,
dad.

510
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,800
I'm so much happier there.
Yeah,

511
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:38,510
you mean it's so many people that want 
to do so many things and they could.

512
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,250
They could,
they could,

513
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,500
but as a parent,
oh fuck,

514
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:43,100
all that.

515
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,450
I mean,
I'm go for it.

516
00:24:44,451 --> 00:24:45,800
I have,
I got,

517
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,390
I've got two and one is not into school 
is not into it.

518
00:24:50,391 --> 00:24:53,450
Pull them out and I got home.
She seems like a comedian.

519
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:55,700
Like she is.
This sheet she dropped.

520
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,490
She seems the same.
She's funny.

521
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,370
She doesn't care about authority.
She's clever.

522
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,100
Just not into school.
She's probably smart.

523
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,810
She is dad.
She is,

524
00:25:05,811 --> 00:25:07,430
but she's.
But she sees her dad.

525
00:25:07,431 --> 00:25:08,840
He's like,
this guy doesn't do nothing.

526
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,900
Sits around talking shit about bread.
That's right.

527
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,870
That's exactly it.
He's baking bread.

528
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,440
He's always smiling.
Baking bread or going to a show.

529
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,150
Billy's dad just had a heart attack.

530
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,010
Billy's Dad freaking out and he works 
for a financial institution.

531
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,013
You don't go to work.
You don't go to the stuff and put as a 

532
00:25:28,641 --> 00:25:29,660
parent,
I can't be like,

533
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,890
yeah,
just hang out.

534
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,930
No,
you can't be just hanging out,

535
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,550
but you can be like,
find your groove,

536
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,350
find a thing,
and then get into it.

537
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,233
You know,
I think introducing kids to things that 

538
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:41,000
they can get into,
super important,

539
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:42,560
but what about the school thing?
Can you,

540
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,740
if your kid,
if your kid brings home sees,

541
00:25:45,741 --> 00:25:48,920
do you get on her or do you say you got 
to step it up.

542
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,023
There's a real.
Stepping it up is making her that drone 

543
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,753
both.
There's a real problem and it's that 

544
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,793
kind of learning is boring.
Like all of a sudden I was not in the 

545
00:25:57,561 --> 00:26:01,640
science at school.
I can't get enough science as an adult,

546
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:02,810
as an adult.

547
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:03,643
I constantly read scientific American 
watch all those science shows on tv 

548
00:26:08,811 --> 00:26:12,000
about fucking space in astrology.
They make it look strong.

549
00:26:12,001 --> 00:26:13,620
You rather.
It's fascinating.

550
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,133
The cosmos.
You ever seen the Neil degrasse Tyson 

551
00:26:16,251 --> 00:26:17,084
series the best.
I couldn't wait for that thing to come 

552
00:26:18,231 --> 00:26:20,570
on every week we celebrated when that 
came on.

553
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,250
Look,
science is fascinating.

554
00:26:22,251 --> 00:26:25,970
They find these seven new exoplanets 
that they think have it life.

555
00:26:25,971 --> 00:26:26,810
You're like,
Jesus,

556
00:26:26,811 --> 00:26:27,980
I know.
They're like earth.

557
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,660
Amazing.
When I was a kid,

558
00:26:29,661 --> 00:26:34,430
I could not have given less of a fuck.
I didn't care about any of it.

559
00:26:34,431 --> 00:26:37,730
I was like,
why boring teachers?

560
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,613
Math teachers,
hundred percent if Neil degrasse tyson 

561
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,400
was my astronomy teacher in school or 
taught astrophysics

562
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,230
or whatever and taught it the way he 
teaches things.

563
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:51,240
Like when he talks about stuff he gets 
you so excited about the ideas that he's

564
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:54,110
talking about.
Any cause he's able,

565
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,000
he's intelligent and can explain it in a
way that you'll understand it.

566
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,183
I think his passion for it's real,
like she was really excited by and when 

567
00:27:02,131 --> 00:27:03,480
you.
Here's the other thing,

568
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:04,314
it's almost like it's engineered to be 
that way and I don't want to get all 

569
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:07,524
fucking crazy tower seven on anybody,
but if you look at the idea of school 

570
00:27:11,941 --> 00:27:12,774
itself,
why the fuck are they paying those 

571
00:27:14,491 --> 00:27:17,190
teachers so little.
I mean teachers,

572
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:22,620
they have arguably the most important 
job in developing your child.

573
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:25,590
Outside of you.
It's you,

574
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:26,860
the parent and then the teacher?
Yeah,

575
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,713
for sure.
And how many teachers are just kind of 

576
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,113
barely getting by with a total ceiling 
on how much money that can make your 

577
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:33,450
right?

578
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:37,560
Because my,
my science teacher was,

579
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:42,240
he wasn't like being gay.
He was a stressed out chain smoking,

580
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,980
angry guy and bad shitty clothes because
he couldn't afford anything else.

581
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,710
This guys,
life pressures are so huge.

582
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:55,020
He can't be like jazzed about science.
He's worried about getting kicked out of

583
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:57,660
his apartment and whether he's get lung 
cancer from smoking,

584
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:58,523
from chain smoking.
If you did pay this guy twice what he 

585
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:03,880
was making,
he'd be relaxed.

586
00:28:03,881 --> 00:28:05,400
He'd be motivated,
he'd be into it.

587
00:28:05,401 --> 00:28:08,280
He could spend more time putting plated,
you know,

588
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:11,070
but if that's what you want to do,
like if you want to be a teacher,

589
00:28:11,071 --> 00:28:11,904
they go,
well you know how much you are going to 

590
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:13,620
get paid.
Yeah,

591
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:14,603
but why?
It's one of those things where you're 

592
00:28:15,631 --> 00:28:16,464
getting paid that much because people 
have decided you're getting paid that 

593
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:19,614
much.
They decided to only allocate a certain 

594
00:28:20,821 --> 00:28:21,654
amount of resources towards education,
but meanwhile think about how much more 

595
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:25,290
money they spend on military.

596
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,183
Well,
I was just going to say that there's no 

597
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:30,450
talk right now about increasing spending
for schools.

598
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,343
That's probably the most important thing
we could do is make less losers schools 

599
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,440
better.
It's the most.

600
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:38,743
It is the most important thing,
but is there an advantage to keeping 

601
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:46,650
some part of the population dumb man,
that's the big fight.

602
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,600
I don't think that's the big conspiracy 
theory,

603
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,370
right,
but I don't think it's a conspiracy.

604
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,293
I think it is just a convenience.
I think once people are in a community 

605
00:28:55,531 --> 00:28:56,364
that's poor,
there is no incentive for the wealthy 

606
00:28:58,951 --> 00:29:01,710
people that are in government or running
government to say,

607
00:29:01,711 --> 00:29:06,030
let's allocate a an inordinate amount of
resources to try to rebuild these areas.

608
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,280
They don't benefit from that or people 
with money.

609
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,230
The only way you can get them to benefit
from that.

610
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:11,064
I saw that chance.
The rapper donated a million dollars to 

611
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,270
Chicago public school system.
Congratulations to that guy.

612
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,510
That's a fucking awesome human being.
He is a class Berlin.

613
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:21,510
If you could donate a million,
how much did you make kid?

614
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,660
Hashtag balling.
Yeah,

615
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,990
man.
I just think that it's.

616
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:36,050
It's not necessarily a conspiracy as 
much as it's just easy to ignore now.

617
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,183
The people who don't have political 
influence and the people making the 

618
00:29:39,301 --> 00:29:42,160
decisions put their kids in school and 
they don't have to worry.

619
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,130
Exactly.
You know,

620
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,000
if everybody had to go to their local 
public school I,

621
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:46,490
but things

622
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,121
change.
Well,

623
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:48,800
it's worse because you're,
you're,

624
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,663
you're making things less safe because 
you're creating more crime because you 

625
00:29:52,191 --> 00:29:53,024
creating more disenfranchised people and
you're creating more of a need to stay 

626
00:29:56,331 --> 00:29:58,640
in your wealthy communities.
Yeah.

627
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,080
He know how it is.
I mean,

628
00:30:00,081 --> 00:30:02,020
it is what it is,
but it's um,

629
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:04,760
it's something that there's no incentive
to change.

630
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,290
It's not like there's a giant amount of 
pressure to look at the same way we look

631
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:10,124
at.
We have to go to Afghanistan and make 

632
00:30:10,891 --> 00:30:12,270
sure it doesn't fall apart.
Maybe.

633
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:14,440
Are you fucking Chicago's falling apart,
man,

634
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,980
like we're talking about.
It's right there.

635
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,350
What?
You have to go to Afghanistan.

636
00:30:17,351 --> 00:30:20,500
We haven't done shit about Detroit.
Detroit is completely full.

637
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,790
There's a lot of fucked up spots in this
country where there's dangerous.

638
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,890
Was Flint still doesn't have good water,
right?

639
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:27,950
Yeah.
Is that still going on in Flint,

640
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:28,784
Michigan?

641
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:34,630
Worse now because they're cutting out 
the abolishing the clean water acts,

642
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:38,390
so it's gonna get worse.
What's going to happen?

643
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,353
Look,
we all are nervous about a lot of 

644
00:30:40,101 --> 00:30:40,934
different things.
My only focus is the environment and 

645
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,613
what's going on with that because that I
care the most about and I don't like my 

646
00:30:49,371 --> 00:30:50,204
kids to be sick.
It's also something you can't pull back 

647
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,390
everything in reversing every emission 
cars.

648
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:04,391
They're going to come to California who 
has the most advanced emissions controls

649
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:05,743
and it's working.
They're going to force California to 

650
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:13,460
lessen the emissions restrictions the 
way that the rest of the country is,

651
00:31:13,461 --> 00:31:15,830
and they're going to go back like 20 
years.

652
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,890
They're changing emissions there.
You know what they're doing.

653
00:31:18,891 --> 00:31:23,891
They're not funding satellites that keep
track of global,

654
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:26,120
of a,
of climate change.

655
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:30,980
They're going to cut off the information
so you don't complain when you're.

656
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,263
When Miami's underwater,
they're putting a waste back in in the 

657
00:31:36,111 --> 00:31:36,944
waters.
They're taking all the regulations off 

658
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:45,410
the head of the EPA is the guy who sued 
the shit out of the EPA,

659
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,680
hates the EPA.
They're tearing it all down.

660
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,850
Can I ask you a question?
Tom?

661
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:54,010
Drilling for drilling for gas in 
yellowstone,

662
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,323
you want to see that?
This is where they're opening the door 

663
00:31:57,711 --> 00:31:59,330
for all of this.
Just.

664
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:00,740
Yes.
You can ask me a question.

665
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,900
Are you a cook?
What?

666
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,640
Do you know what that means?
No.

667
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,940
People who are anti trump when you are 
a.

668
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,791
that's a cop.
Yeah,

669
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:12,270
yeah,
yeah.

670
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,103
No,
my only focus is what's going to happen 

671
00:32:14,341 --> 00:32:17,560
with you.
It's also more like a demo.

672
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,830
What is the official definition?
Again?

673
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:20,803
It used to be cuckold based on cuckold,
which is who likes watching other men 

674
00:32:24,811 --> 00:32:25,644
fuck his wife because there's a whole 
level of porn and then what's the 

675
00:32:28,861 --> 00:32:30,210
official definition?
Now?

676
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,120
It was confusing to us,
but sort of a political thing.

677
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,670
It's sort of like pretending you're 
progressive when you're not new one.

678
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,681
Oh,
is a new one,

679
00:32:37,681 --> 00:32:40,490
and insulted reveals sexual insecurity,
misogyny

680
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:45,490
and fear of those who use the term.
Oh,

681
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:49,610
that's so ridiculous.
So ridiculous.

682
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:55,730
Britain Gq magazine.
What does cook me?

683
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,210
Why are you being called one week 
feckless?

684
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:01,010
Spineless,
and decidedly pathetic.

685
00:33:01,011 --> 00:33:03,880
Specimen of manliness is a derivative of
the turn.

686
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,180
Okay,
so that makes sense.

687
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,590
Huckle anger.
Why people?

688
00:33:06,591 --> 00:33:09,340
Why angry?
White people love calling people.

689
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:15,200
I agree with white men is Christ.
It's a fun word to call.

690
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:19,460
People prefer.
It was insulting when you said it really

691
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,400
felt like,
say it on the news,

692
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,140
you know,
you're just like fuck,

693
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,420
but it's with so it.
Well,

694
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,890
he's a cook.
That's the problem.

695
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,480
The newscasters be like,
we'll be right back with the weather.

696
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,083
They didn't even know what to say.
You just stay right there and you can 

697
00:33:35,631 --> 00:33:39,380
even say the word cuckold Coquille.
He loves cuckold Erotica.

698
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,470
You could probably say that on regular 
TV and they would not.

699
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,100
They would not be able to do anything 
about it.

700
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:43,963
Wow.
That'd be stuck and you've just painted 

701
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:48,470
a ruthless image in their mind.
Some poor sobbing man.

702
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,390
Some fucking dude that looks like iron 
head is laying pipe to the lady.

703
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,850
They take you off to the green room 
book.

704
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,220
We know you can say,
can you just not.

705
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:04,010
Those people need to stop all those 
people that tell you we know you can,

706
00:34:04,011 --> 00:34:05,660
but you shouldn't.
Yeah.

707
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,180
Don't say that word.
Just junk you.

708
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,260
Fuck you.
And your magic words.

709
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:14,960
What do you have child?
There's certain words you can't say.

710
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,853
That is another thing that has to go and
it's being more and more highlighted by 

711
00:34:18,861 --> 00:34:20,410
the Internet.
It's why you're seeing in,

712
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,970
in television shows,
like if you watched the walking dead,

713
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,910
you'll see a lot of random use of 
swears,

714
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,033
you know,
and you'll hear a random use of swears 

715
00:34:28,071 --> 00:34:32,280
on other shows on cable,
say shit during their TV sets.

716
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:34,400
Yes.
Shit is okay.

717
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,990
We've,
we've changed it,

718
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,840
but you can't,
you still can't say fuck if you,

719
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,540
if you watch walking dead,
they've,

720
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:43,600
I don't think they ever say fuck,
I'm pretty sure if they do know,

721
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,250
I'm pretty sure they just say shit and 
asshole.

722
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,130
And they could say tits.
And My last Cole Bear,

723
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:50,980
which I did in December,
ish,

724
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,770
they said,
uh,

725
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:56,840
I couldn't say fly open one ball out.
Hmm.

726
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:02,380
I could say fly open one testicle out or
I could say fly open everything out.

727
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:07,820
But couldn't say one ball duct Stan hope
came up with an idea.

728
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,133
Um,
when we were doing our version of the 

729
00:35:10,431 --> 00:35:15,431
mantra that was a big fat failure.
But a doug came up with this idea to do.

730
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:22,511
I'm a game show where a dude had a box 
over his private areas and a light would

731
00:35:24,111 --> 00:35:29,111
go off whenever it was like,
like your direction.

732
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,300
So the light was red light.
We control the light obviously.

733
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:36,980
So it'd be like dwarves eating bananas.
Light goes off,

734
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,400
like guys

735
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,253
hairy as light goes off.
And they told us Doug's name for the 

736
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:49,041
show was make me hard and they told us 
we couldn't have it called make me hard.

737
00:35:49,621 --> 00:35:52,110
We had to change it to make me stiff.
Right.

738
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,100
And we were like,
what?

739
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,990
Why?
And they're like hard just too,

740
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,770
it's just not the right word.
We think make me step.

741
00:35:57,771 --> 00:35:58,604
And these,
these two ladies that were talking to 

742
00:35:59,281 --> 00:36:02,340
her that had nothing to do with comedy,
like literally nothing.

743
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:05,550
Like how is it stiff is actually more 
offensive.

744
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,840
It's like,
it sounds like a really a dumb person.

745
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:13,850
He gets ready to take my fucking stiffy 
and yet discussing.

746
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,590
So when we were,
uh,

747
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,170
when we're,
when we're doing this,

748
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,393
this light obviously we controlled.
So we played this game show so we 

749
00:36:22,741 --> 00:36:24,060
couldn't call it make me hard,
which,

750
00:36:24,061 --> 00:36:25,110
how to change it to make me Steph.

751
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,450
We lost the argument.
It was the stupidest fucking argument.

752
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,670
And it was so indicative of how 
frustrating those shows can be.

753
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,690
We have all these fucking chefs in the 
kitchen.

754
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:37,370
I just think it'd be better if he was 
wearing blue underwear better.

755
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,410
It would look better.
Um,

756
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,500
so he,
um,

757
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:41,663
the guy's lying there and we have this 
woman come out and she's got these big 

758
00:36:45,841 --> 00:36:46,674
juicy tits and he's sucking on them and 
she's climbing on him and everybody's 

759
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:51,024
going,
Ooh.

760
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,690
And they put a whip cream on her tits 
and he's sucking the whipped cream,

761
00:36:54,691 --> 00:36:57,030
offer nipples and moves like heavy duty 
stuff.

762
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:59,940
Then she pulls her pants down.
She's got a Dick,

763
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,560
right?
Not only does she have a Dick,

764
00:37:01,561 --> 00:37:05,010
she has a dick that looks like it had 
been poisoned,

765
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:09,930
you know,
because she's a transvestite transsexual

766
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:15,020
rather bubbly woman coming because like 
the estrogen,

767
00:37:16,381 --> 00:37:17,820
it was like kid killed the deck.

768
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,350
Oh No.
It's like dark.

769
00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:21,710
And like it was like a crispy French 
fries.

770
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,810
You get to Jerry's Deli like,
Whoa,

771
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:30,050
but that was okay.
That was okay.

772
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,560
Yeah,
I mean we had a blur the deck,

773
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:34,680
but that was okay.
You just can't use the word hard.

774
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,990
So weird.
So stupid.

775
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:41,100
So weird.
Hard to bad word is hard to bad word.

776
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,890
Fuck off.
Testicle sounded worse than ball to me.

777
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,250
One testicle out it.
Testicle sounds.

778
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,670
Look,
what about that?

779
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,410
It's kind of fun.
Half sack half's heck out.

780
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:56,940
Says Negus said fuck a few times in that
scene where he was a bad scene.

781
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:57,774
I guess that was censored version where 
he says like 23 times and uncensored 

782
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:01,074
version.
I didn't see the real workers and so 

783
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,680
that was the scene that made me stop 
watching that show.

784
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,060
It was like,
that's it.

785
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:08,130
What am I watching?
I'm watching torture show.

786
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,550
This isn't a fun show anymore.
This isn't a show where people trying to

787
00:38:11,551 --> 00:38:15,650
get away from zombies.
The zombies are inconsequential.

788
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,820
You can like push them aside now used to
eat horses,

789
00:38:17,821 --> 00:38:18,654
raw terror horse apart and right now you
can just kind of trip them and push 

790
00:38:21,421 --> 00:38:23,180
them.
Devops,

791
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,440
it's so stupid.
Nobody gets killed by zombies.

792
00:38:25,441 --> 00:38:27,810
Everybody gets killed by each other.
I was like,

793
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,090
it's just so stupid.
It's been on a long time.

794
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:31,630
That's enough.
Yeah.

795
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,660
I wasn't enough.
I think I watched one season.

796
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,150
Yeah,
I just can't.

797
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,010
If it

798
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,250
was like 28 days later,
zombies,

799
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,090
I think it'd be way better.
I think.

800
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:40,953
Yeah,
there's something about the fact these 

801
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:46,300
zombies are so fucking slow and they 
never seem to starve to death.

802
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,430
Like explain to me how they're still 
going.

803
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,430
They brains,
but there's no one to eat.

804
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,050
They're all zombies.
The known each other,

805
00:38:53,051 --> 00:38:54,250
which is bizarre.
It's fuck.

806
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:58,510
What do you have like Zombie rules 
cannibalize each other.

807
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,353
How come you fucks are running around 
looking for people that are moving and 

808
00:39:01,961 --> 00:39:03,520
you're moving and you don't need each 
other.

809
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,930
You have cloudy eyes.
You could barely see.

810
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:08,823
All people have to do is cover 
themselves with guts and blood and they 

811
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:14,200
pass as a Zombie and they walk around 
you.

812
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,060
That's all I gotta do.
Fuck out of here.

813
00:39:16,061 --> 00:39:17,860
Yeah,
it makes me mad.

814
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,400
It makes me mad.
That's ridiculous.

815
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:24,340
Making up their own Zombie ass rules.

816
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,181
Yeah.
Fuck you.

817
00:39:25,181 --> 00:39:27,670
And your Zombie rule.
Stick with the plan.

818
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,770
See those 28 days later.
Zombies.

819
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,580
Those are the fast ones.
The ones I liked.

820
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,660
The ones that look like they're on 
rabies.

821
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,460
Yeah.
Just chase you.

822
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,361
Those,
those.

823
00:39:37,361 --> 00:39:39,490
Uh,
I saw those in thousand oaks.

824
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,440
You saw Zombie like that?
Yeah.

825
00:39:41,441 --> 00:39:42,610
Like a whole.
Her real one.

826
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:43,780
Yeah.
I think it was going on.

827
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,040
I was just a.
what's that?

828
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,400
Was there a sale?
There was black Friday sale.

829
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:51,540
It was black Friday.
Is that the worst thing that we do as.

830
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,830
As a culture?
It's A.

831
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:53,763
Yeah.
Trample over each other on the way 

832
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:56,220
through Walmart.
Yeah.

833
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:00,070
Who Does?
Who Does?

834
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,210
Who does that?
Yeah.

835
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,800
I don't do it.
Do you do it?

836
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,510
I don't do it,
but a lot of people do it.

837
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,100
What?
People are good.

838
00:40:06,101 --> 00:40:07,870
I don't know.
People on TV.

839
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,180
My kids want to do it.

840
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:14,050
My kids don't let them do it.
People not disgusting.

841
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,880
Well,
it's just ridiculous.

842
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:19,240
Yeah,
but you'd line up outside of a store and

843
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:21,530
you save $10 or whatever the fuck you 
say.

844
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,021
Crap.
Yeah.

845
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:25,420
How much you save?
Who Cares?

846
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,030
Why don't you make a nice little card 
instead of going to.

847
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,163
You know what though?
There's things that become things like 

848
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:35,170
somehow or another they just become 
events like I'm used to be devil's night

849
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:37,810
in Detroit,
which was the day before Halloween.

850
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:41,120
Was Lighthouses on fire Devil's night.
Yeah.

851
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,240
It was arson night,
wasn't it?

852
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:44,500
Is that what it's called?
Devil's night.

853
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,413
See?
See if you literally light people's 

854
00:40:46,331 --> 00:40:48,050
homes with them in it.
Well,

855
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,140
I don't know.
We had cabinets.

856
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,053
Shirts happened.
You'd throw eggs at the cops and a 

857
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:52,483
habit.
It was called cabbage night the night 

858
00:40:54,551 --> 00:40:57,880
before when I was a cabbage old Timey,
New Jersey.

859
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:00,040
One time.
There was cabbage in the fields.

860
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,470
Angel's night.
Um,

861
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:02,703
it's an event designed to mitigate 
criminal acts associated with Devil's 

862
00:41:04,841 --> 00:41:08,440
night in Detroit after brutal is Devil's
night in 1994.

863
00:41:08,441 --> 00:41:09,970
Then new mayor Dennis.
Archer.

864
00:41:09,971 --> 00:41:12,250
Promise city residents are.
Will not be tolerated.

865
00:41:12,251 --> 00:41:13,084
Yeah,
Devil's night is a scroll down to see 

866
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,110
this a.
It didn't catch on though.

867
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,330
Yeah.
Well,

868
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:21,370
the devil's night thing apparently was 
going on a lot.

869
00:41:21,371 --> 00:41:22,204
We would hear about it in high school.
She really look at the flaming bags of 

870
00:41:24,881 --> 00:41:29,800
canine feces in front of portraits.
Always fun canine feces like shit.

871
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:32,710
You can't even say who says feces you 
put talking to.

872
00:41:32,711 --> 00:41:33,544
It's A.

873
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:35,210
Well,
if you said Shit,

874
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,770
I would have never known what you were 
saying.

875
00:41:36,771 --> 00:41:37,604
So thank you for saying fishies.
Is there something nice to using feces 

876
00:41:41,181 --> 00:41:43,100
once in a while rather than shit?
Yes.

877
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:47,150
If a scientist doing talking to a 
scientist and he's like,

878
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,043
well it's really important that we get 
feces samples of these animals to make 

879
00:41:50,531 --> 00:41:51,364
sure that you don't want your.
Or saying your doctor saying go shit in 

880
00:41:53,991 --> 00:41:56,270
this cup.
Amount of your collecting animal shit.

881
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,730
Make sure we got a lot of them guys.
I was.

882
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,753
I was watching this show on the science 
channel last night and the science 

883
00:42:06,021 --> 00:42:11,021
channel by the way is it's not all 
science thing.

884
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,260
There's a lot of marketing.
Get goofy,

885
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:20,240
start selling you foes and they started 
to do these shows.

886
00:42:20,241 --> 00:42:21,200
Man,
where they have a.

887
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,043
there's a certain amount of experts,
like there's a guy I really want to get 

888
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:24,680
him on.

889
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,513
He's like the preeminent,
like legitimately intelligent Ufo 

890
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,080
expert's name,
Stanton Freedman,

891
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,380
and he's like,
I think he's a nuclear physicist.

892
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:37,700
Actually a real guy.
See if he could find his wikipedia.

893
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:38,873
I is named,
I believe his name is Stanton Friedman 

894
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,580
and he is a,
and he was on one of those last time,

895
00:42:43,581 --> 00:42:45,440
but he's one of those guys where you see
them on willow shows.

896
00:42:45,441 --> 00:42:46,191
You Go,
oh,

897
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:50,770
I know I'm watching a show about 
bullshit because he's a guy,

898
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,780
not that he's full of shit.
He's like,

899
00:42:53,781 --> 00:42:54,614
you actually make some real sense as far
as like what kind of physics would be 

900
00:42:57,201 --> 00:43:01,310
required in order to make a craft that 
can travel between worlds.

901
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,240
Um,
is that.

902
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,840
No,
that's not the same guy.

903
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,060
Civilian investigator.
The Roswell incident.

904
00:43:08,061 --> 00:43:08,894
Maybe it is.
Yeah.

905
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,150
Where's this?
Where's this picture?

906
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,840
Those picture looks weird.
Oh,

907
00:43:11,841 --> 00:43:12,920
it's just a weird angle of him.

908
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,753
Yeah,
that's him.

909
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:15,530
That's him.
Um,

910
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,730
yeah.
Stanton Freedman.

911
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,870
Yeah.
He's um,

912
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,480
yeah,
he was on the show last night.

913
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:20,323
I was watching.
I was like,

914
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,163
Oh,
you son of a bitch next to this big 

915
00:43:21,951 --> 00:43:22,784
foot.
Yeah,

916
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,030
exactly.
He's coming.

917
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:26,810
Psychics are coming.
But before that it was,

918
00:43:26,811 --> 00:43:27,644
um,
there was a show about this explorer 

919
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:33,260
that something,
I forget his name,

920
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:37,040
tweeted it yesterday to somebody in 
response to somebody.

921
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,910
I tweeted the whole incident and then I 
tweeted this guy's name,

922
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,340
but he was an explorer in 19,
25.

923
00:43:43,341 --> 00:43:46,940
They went into the Amazon and he was 
looking for El Dorado,

924
00:43:46,941 --> 00:43:49,400
which is like this purported city of 
gold.

925
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:51,530
There was a legendary story in the,
in the Amazon.

926
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,470
Yeah.
But there was something about him that I

927
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:56,750
had tweeted earlier in a great car.
The Eldorado.

928
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:57,711
Well,
anyway,

929
00:43:57,711 --> 00:43:58,790
this guy,
um,

930
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,900
in 1925 went to the Amazon and saw these
mounds,

931
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,500
these mounds in the day,
you don't know,

932
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,960
this is almost 100 years ago.

933
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:08,060
And uh,
he was,

934
00:44:08,061 --> 00:44:08,894
uh,
he wanted to investigate these mounds 

935
00:44:09,891 --> 00:44:11,150
because you've got on top of one of 
them.

936
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:14,240
And he looked out and he saw another 
mound there is named Percy Fawcett.

937
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,820
You saw another mound out in the 
distance.

938
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:20,740
And then he realized that they were on a
grid and he realized that there's a city

939
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:21,590
here.
This is a city.

940
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:22,610
It's like,
oh my God,

941
00:44:22,611 --> 00:44:24,770
I'm looking,
these aren't dirt mountains.

942
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:26,000
These are city.
Yeah,

943
00:44:26,001 --> 00:44:30,080
these are stone structures that the 
earth has sort of covered up because the

944
00:44:30,081 --> 00:44:32,370
Amazon,
it's just so tense.

945
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,360
It just covers everything massive.
So super recently,

946
00:44:36,361 --> 00:44:37,194
like within the last decade,
they've got these satellite images of 

947
00:44:40,531 --> 00:44:44,490
that area and they found these pictures 
like what Jamie just pulled up that last

948
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:45,403
article that see those images,
that's all stuff that they found out 

949
00:44:48,991 --> 00:44:52,800
from the ceiling or from a satellite's 
rather from the ceiling.

950
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,460
It looks like a snowman.
They were saying that they did these,

951
00:44:56,461 --> 00:44:57,294
um,
well they're just,

952
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:58,163
you know,
it's just paths and structures is a 

953
00:44:59,041 --> 00:45:01,470
bunch of them though.
There's a ton of.

954
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:02,793
When,
when was this discovered really 

955
00:45:03,841 --> 00:45:05,550
recently,
really recently.

956
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,140
Um,
but um,

957
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:09,580
so one of the,
on the show,

958
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:10,414
they were saying that the carbon tested 
some of these mounds and they were over 

959
00:45:13,591 --> 00:45:14,580
6,000
years old,

960
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,540
so thousand years old.
This is the speculation.

961
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:19,374
This,
this show might have been wrong what 

962
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:21,684
they were asserting.
And it could totally be true because 

963
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:25,320
definitely some culture 6,000
years ago,

964
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:27,630
they're just finding out about that 
6,000

965
00:45:27,631 --> 00:45:28,920
years ago,
somehow or another,

966
00:45:28,921 --> 00:45:33,240
these people had created irrigation.
They had created these,

967
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:35,090
these pathways,
you know,

968
00:45:35,091 --> 00:45:36,570
they,
they had made a grid,

969
00:45:36,571 --> 00:45:38,850
like a system against what looked like a
city,

970
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:42,130
but it didn't look like a settled,
like group of tents or something.

971
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:46,070
Like how long have human beings on the 
planet and enormous area to have.

972
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,370
It's bigger,
bigger than Georgia.

973
00:45:47,371 --> 00:45:50,220
What does it say that it could have 
maintained a population of 60,000

974
00:45:50,221 --> 00:45:51,054
people,
more people than in many medieval 

975
00:45:52,591 --> 00:45:54,450
European cities.
Wow.

976
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:57,600
The structures were created by a network
of trenches about 36 feet,

977
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:58,823
nearly 11 meters wide and several feet 
deep line by banks up to three feet 

978
00:46:03,331 --> 00:46:04,164
high,
somewhere ringed by low mounds 

979
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:08,130
containing ceramics,
charcoal and stone tools.

980
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,650
It's thought that they were used for 
fortifications,

981
00:46:10,651 --> 00:46:13,710
homes and ceremonies,
and could have maintained populations of

982
00:46:13,711 --> 00:46:16,350
$60,000.
That's saying they sound fun.

983
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:17,520
Yeah.
Great people,

984
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,140
they were cannibals.
Oh yeah.

985
00:46:19,141 --> 00:46:20,910
But that other than the ones that he 
found.

986
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,280
But other than that,
they're fine.

987
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:26,850
So he had these guides and the guides,
we're taking them to this mount.

988
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,610
Obviously this is again,
a Wonky TV show.

989
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,290
Might've been bullshit,
you know,

990
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:31,901
they,
they,

991
00:46:31,901 --> 00:46:35,940
they go fast and loose with the facts or
tomato show seemed more fun and they got

992
00:46:35,941 --> 00:46:36,774
me.

993
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:41,040
They were saying that he was told by his
guidance to stay back.

994
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:41,874
They wouldn't go any further because 
there's cannibals and he was never seen 

995
00:46:44,011 --> 00:46:48,960
from again the last contact with him.
He ran into some other tribes.

996
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:49,820
I was like,
yeah,

997
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:50,653
somebody probably jacked him.
They probably knew even back then the 

998
00:46:52,261 --> 00:46:56,180
white people coming over from England,
like what can they just want it as north

999
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:57,014
face.
He didn't have to throw everything back 

1000
00:46:59,581 --> 00:47:02,960
then was probably super nice.
How long were crap though?

1001
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:06,530
People,
people in this forum and this forum,

1002
00:47:06,531 --> 00:47:09,420
I think it's been 150,000
years.

1003
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:14,690
One hundred 50 I think.
And what's the oldest town that we found

1004
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,593
like that?
I think the oldest structures that they 

1005
00:47:18,511 --> 00:47:23,511
know of right now are somewhere around 
14,000

1006
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:28,020
plus years ago.
14th as far as like stone structures.

1007
00:47:28,021 --> 00:47:30,310
Like when they went to like one of the 
very first

1008
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,950
cities,
which was in Beirut.

1009
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,260
Ooh,
it was this,

1010
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,113
I forget the name of it,
but it was like one of the original 

1011
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:38,190
cities,
like where they actually started to grid

1012
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,890
out and stuff.
And uh,

1013
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:41,500
but I don't know how long ago that was.
Well,

1014
00:47:41,501 --> 00:47:42,334
let's find out what is the oldest known 
evidence of civilization and what do 

1015
00:47:46,481 --> 00:47:49,810
they do determine a civilization like 
functioning?

1016
00:47:49,811 --> 00:47:50,860
Like,
you know,

1017
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,630
we were hunters gatherers first,
right?

1018
00:47:52,631 --> 00:47:54,070
But he,
I guess,

1019
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:54,904
where do you draw the line?
I guess when did you have girlfriends 

1020
00:47:56,921 --> 00:48:01,540
and like have fun on a Saturday night.
What did you guys have a drive through?

1021
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:02,913
That's when it all started.
So when I was at a food festival the 

1022
00:48:05,351 --> 00:48:07,420
other day and the band pretty good.
Van,

1023
00:48:07,421 --> 00:48:08,254
like these young guys were playing Elton
John Saturday night and were like 

1024
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:13,310
Saturday,
Saturday,

1025
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,240
Saturday.
And I was thinking,

1026
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:19,390
is that as important to kids as it was 
when we were like,

1027
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:22,390
yeah,
because school Saturday it important.

1028
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:26,040
Is that still the way it is?
Yeah.

1029
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:26,953
School makes it important.
Earliest evidence of modern human 

1030
00:48:28,961 --> 00:48:30,910
culture found 20,000
years.

1031
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:33,040
Oh Wow.
Forty 4,000

1032
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:34,540
years ago,
over 20,000

1033
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:38,440
years before other findings.
Modern modern human behavior.

1034
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,393
So this is the earliest unambiguous 
evidence for modern human behavior has 

1035
00:48:42,611 --> 00:48:45,730
been discovered in an international team
of researchers in a South African cave.

1036
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,713
Now,
here's what's crazy that is saying that 

1037
00:48:48,461 --> 00:48:53,461
the first evidence of civilization of 
modern human behavior was all 44,000

1038
00:48:56,561 --> 00:48:59,500
years ago.
That's so crazy recent.

1039
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:04,390
That's so recent.
And then the earliest stone structures I

1040
00:49:04,391 --> 00:49:06,880
think is that the stuff they found in 
Turkey,

1041
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,190
the really big stone structures in 
Turkey at,

1042
00:49:09,191 --> 00:49:10,930
um,
go becky,

1043
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,140
go Beckley,
Tepi.

1044
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:13,023
I think that's the oldest right now as 
far as like really complex because that 

1045
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:16,743
before then they weren't really,
they weren't really convinced that 

1046
00:49:18,161 --> 00:49:19,690
people could do that kind of stuff back 
then.

1047
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,810
So that means in 30,000
years they figured out how to make that.

1048
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:23,673
There's gotta be some older structures 
that they just haven't found that are 

1049
00:49:26,351 --> 00:49:28,990
way down or could see.
Yeah.

1050
00:49:28,991 --> 00:49:32,230
I think they're guessing you definitely,
they're guessing with a lot of evidence.

1051
00:49:32,231 --> 00:49:33,064
That's a good.
I'm guessing with a complete supply of 

1052
00:49:35,561 --> 00:49:38,710
evidence that be found,
this whole other culture,

1053
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:42,880
will they find stuff aliens in it where 
they find stuff is in the oceans because

1054
00:49:42,881 --> 00:49:43,714
the water levels prison since then,
so they find like entire cities like 

1055
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:52,230
underwater that that I think there's 
probably some amazing evidence.

1056
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,710
They've never even discovered,
right.

1057
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,390
Ancient cities.
So there's got to be.

1058
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:58,330
But you got to think also that what was 
the city made out of?

1059
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,490
Because unless it was made out of solid 
stone,

1060
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:03,990
the oceans just going to destroy the 
ocean crept over.

1061
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,833
Malibu.
Do you think you would find anything in 

1062
00:50:07,031 --> 00:50:07,960
3000 years?

1063
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,090
Right.
What would you find?

1064
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:15,150
Gary Busey is this thing on marina.
She'll still be at the back.

1065
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:21,680
What do I find a good time?
Is this thing on the pills?

1066
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:23,110
Come on.
We're in Malibu,

1067
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:29,030
which is vanished.
Totally vanished.

1068
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,730
Salt Water,
metal,

1069
00:50:31,731 --> 00:50:32,564
and even if it was anything made of 
metal would give out after a thousand 

1070
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:36,853
years.
What about like any jobs and stuff that 

1071
00:50:37,821 --> 00:50:39,530
are down under the ocean?
Not that old.

1072
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,590
There's some hundreds.
There's nothing that's like.

1073
00:50:42,591 --> 00:50:43,421
Yeah,
I mean there's.

1074
00:50:43,421 --> 00:50:47,510
There's probably some the remanence of 
it of like the Roman times,

1075
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,190
but think of that.
What's that?

1076
00:50:49,191 --> 00:50:50,490
A thousand years?
Yeah,

1077
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,980
right.
Two thousand years.

1078
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:54,520
Three hundred years.
What about 7,000?

1079
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:56,290
What about eight?
Nothing you're not going to find.

1080
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,810
So we're talking about more than 14,000
years old.

1081
00:50:59,811 --> 00:51:02,690
If it was a city like this,
you ain't gonna find shit,

1082
00:51:02,691 --> 00:51:07,691
but what if just hear me out.
What if it was covered with lava and you

1083
00:51:08,901 --> 00:51:09,440
couldn't.

1084
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,273
And then get solidified it like Pompei 
crack that bitch open and we're ranch 

1085
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:15,843
where divers discuss,
discover ancient Roman treasure trove 

1086
00:51:19,221 --> 00:51:22,190
and shipwreck.
Sixteen hundred year old shipwreck.

1087
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:24,230
Whoa.
There's still some stuff,

1088
00:51:24,231 --> 00:51:26,870
but like the ship's gone and look at the
anchor dude.

1089
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:28,900
They found the anchor.
A.

1090
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,120
You go back to that anchor again.
Find a little coins.

1091
00:51:32,121 --> 00:51:33,410
Look at that.
Is that the anchor?

1092
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:36,070
Yeah,
that's a long walk.

1093
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:38,450
That's so cool.
That is cool.

1094
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:40,183
Imagine that they would throw a giant 
hunk of metal overboard yet it to snag 

1095
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,280
them over and then they would hope that 
they'd be able to pick it up within that

1096
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:54,560
role and look at the rare bronze statue.
Holy Shit.

1097
00:51:54,561 --> 00:51:56,210
That's incredible.
You've been to Rome,

1098
00:51:56,211 --> 00:51:57,140
right?
Yeah.

1099
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,970
Just once.
Just last summer.

1100
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,420
Two summers ago.
Last summer.

1101
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:03,790
And pretty mind blowing,
isn't it?

1102
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,660
Fuck man.
Life changing.

1103
00:52:05,661 --> 00:52:07,580
The images are insane.
Look at all this stuff.

1104
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:09,710
They're finding down there that.
Wait a minute.

1105
00:52:09,711 --> 00:52:12,410
That was the statue of Liberty.
The Statue of Liberty.

1106
00:52:12,411 --> 00:52:16,010
And get back to the souvenir shop on 
third street.

1107
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,240
Someone's fucking with us,
man.

1108
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:21,050
Goddamn liberty.
Holy Cow.

1109
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:22,743
Stole.
It's about as close to the statue of 

1110
00:52:24,471 --> 00:52:26,130
Liberty as you can get it.
Really?

1111
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,950
She's.
She's just the same pose.

1112
00:52:27,951 --> 00:52:30,230
Just not holding the torch.
We'll look at the bottom of it.

1113
00:52:30,231 --> 00:52:31,720
It's like a horn.
Yeah.

1114
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,633
What is it?
Is it like you drink out of that or 

1115
00:52:33,921 --> 00:52:35,030
something?
I think it's poseidon.

1116
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:36,670
What?
Oh,

1117
00:52:36,671 --> 00:52:37,700
what is it?
Yeah.

1118
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:40,010
What is it at the bottom though?
It seems like it's got it.

1119
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:42,540
Doesn't Jamie like a horn?
Like a buffalo?

1120
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:44,560
Some kind,
yeah,

1121
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:46,770
like maybe you drank out of that,
right?

1122
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:48,853
That's probably a new handle.
I mean if you flip it upside down like 

1123
00:52:52,641 --> 00:52:56,510
the [inaudible] could be to and.
But it's the wrong way.

1124
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:00,890
It looks like you would want to see her 
if it was on a handle on her face facing

1125
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:02,480
the door.
It's a hood ornament.

1126
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:03,741
Oh yeah,
that's right.

1127
00:53:03,741 --> 00:53:05,080
Because on the front of the car.
Oh yeah.

1128
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:05,943
When our old buicks big as a house kids 
that lived across the street from me 

1129
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,820
where like,
uh,

1130
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:18,230
like maybe five years older and that was
the thing to do on Saturday nights.

1131
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,870
There were parties in the neighborhood 
with adults and stuff.

1132
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:23,150
They would go rip off everybody's hood 
ornaments.

1133
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:24,500
Oh,
the household.

1134
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:25,363
They had a whole box of like the big 
ornaments from the front and then like 

1135
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:33,890
the names on them from the side there.
Just take a screwdriver and ornaments.

1136
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:38,730
Such dick's has.
They're such dicks.

1137
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,520
And when you give kids freedom,
you let him go outside,

1138
00:53:41,521 --> 00:53:46,521
like anywhere,
what's ring that doorbell and go go,

1139
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,640
go a little fucking gremlins in your 
windows,

1140
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,490
throwing eggs at your house where people
give them homework,

1141
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,540
her homework because you just let it be 
free.

1142
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:59,070
These gonna go nuts.
But it was a pipe.

1143
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:00,970
Could be.
Yeah,

1144
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:02,690
it fine.
I was like looking for more pipe.

1145
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,310
Big Pipe.
Holy Shit.

1146
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,110
To Roman pipe right here.
I to party.

1147
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,033
So I just be an ancient Roman.
I might've made it in the style of 

1148
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:12,510
ancient Roman.
Um,

1149
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,420
I don't know about all that plastic 
mouth.

1150
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:20,910
Plastic or is it carved out of be 
spencer gifts?

1151
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:27,990
You get more than $100 at forever.
Twenty one bubbles come out of it.

1152
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:29,503
They're trying to encourage pipe smoking
now that trump's in office trying to be 

1153
00:54:33,091 --> 00:54:33,924
pretentious.
I smoked a pipe recently on the podcast 

1154
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:38,290
a couple of weeks ago.
That's good over there.

1155
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,393
I was going to bring a cigar,
but I didn't know if you could smoke a 

1156
00:54:40,801 --> 00:54:41,660
cigar in here.
Yeah,

1157
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:42,920
we could.
Sure.

1158
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:43,763
Yeah.
Just turn on that filter thing and we 

1159
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:46,940
could smoke.
I think we smoked cigars in here,

1160
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:47,783
right?
Yeah.

1161
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:50,310
Wow.
Let's do that next time.

1162
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:55,640
I have a big thing of Cuban cigars.
Do you juggle or illegal?

1163
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:57,300
Big shots.
Big shots.

1164
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:00,660
Big shots.
Illegal through a guy.

1165
00:55:00,661 --> 00:55:02,610
I know in Vegas.
It's not a big deal.

1166
00:55:02,611 --> 00:55:07,310
I know people a little to get them.
Thanks for great.

1167
00:55:07,311 --> 00:55:07,970
It was good.
Yeah,

1168
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:09,930
it was fun.
The fight was weird though.

1169
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:12,960
The main event,
there was a lot of controversy.

1170
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:15,630
People thought it was a boring fight.
Oh really?

1171
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:16,161
Yeah,
yeah.

1172
00:55:16,161 --> 00:55:16,994
Yeah.
It was just not a lot of action 

1173
00:55:18,451 --> 00:55:19,284
happened.
It was very tactical fight for most of 

1174
00:55:20,881 --> 00:55:22,620
the five rounds.
Then the fifth round,

1175
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:27,870
tyron woodley cracked them and almost 
had them out cold but was losing most of

1176
00:55:27,871 --> 00:55:30,030
the round in a lot of people's eyes 
before then.

1177
00:55:30,031 --> 00:55:32,880
So the scoring was really oddly,
uh,

1178
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:34,023
it was,
it was really odd because a lot of 

1179
00:55:35,311 --> 00:55:36,810
people disagree with the score.
The score was,

1180
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:40,650
it was for the champion,
but the first fight they had was a draw.

1181
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:42,570
And then people,
a lot of people like,

1182
00:55:42,571 --> 00:55:43,404
well,
if that first part was to draw this 

1183
00:55:43,891 --> 00:55:47,940
fight was a draw to including the guy 
who was commentating with dominick Cruz,

1184
00:55:47,941 --> 00:55:49,440
a former,
a bantamweight champion.

1185
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:50,843
So it was um,
a lot of people felt disappointed when 

1186
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,530
you're in that situation and you're 
broadcasting it,

1187
00:55:56,670 --> 00:56:00,390
do you speak your mind like sometimes 
you think it's weird sometimes,

1188
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,380
but I don't want to.

1189
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,960
I didn't think in that case it was that 
weird.

1190
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,470
Okay.
I felt like I don't.

1191
00:56:06,471 --> 00:56:09,280
I think the scoring system sucks.
Oh yeah.

1192
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:12,090
Do you know anything about scoring 
system for MMA?

1193
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:16,500
We essentially took the boxing scoring 
system and adapted it to mma.

1194
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:17,363
Oh.
So it's a 10 point must system and it's 

1195
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:21,960
very difficult to get around to be 
scored 10,

1196
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,590
eight.
The with that is,

1197
00:56:23,591 --> 00:56:28,591
I don't think it leaves enough room for 
a accurately judging all the events that

1198
00:56:31,151 --> 00:56:31,984
take place in a five minute period of 
combat sports because there's so many 

1199
00:56:35,231 --> 00:56:36,064
different interactions.
I think those interactions should 

1200
00:56:38,381 --> 00:56:42,640
probably be judged on their own merit.
Like almost like,

1201
00:56:42,641 --> 00:56:43,474
um,
it should be like there should be a way 

1202
00:56:45,461 --> 00:56:49,750
to quantify how much damage was done,
whether or not it was the right thing to

1203
00:56:49,751 --> 00:56:50,584
do and it should be like probably a 
hundred point score system or something 

1204
00:56:52,661 --> 00:56:53,370
like that.

1205
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:54,203
A lot more factors,
a lot more factors like the difference 

1206
00:56:56,261 --> 00:56:59,170
between a 10,
nine and in one round at 10,

1207
00:56:59,171 --> 00:57:01,270
nine and another round.
Totally different fight.

1208
00:57:01,271 --> 00:57:04,300
Like one guy's getting dominated and 
he's clearly losing.

1209
00:57:04,301 --> 00:57:07,600
And the other one it's a toss up and 
it's still there both to 10,

1210
00:57:07,601 --> 00:57:08,950
nine rounds.
It doesn't make sense.

1211
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,990
A does it work for boxing because it's 
longer and it's just one thing.

1212
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,233
Just one thing.
It's three minutes instead of five 

1213
00:57:17,471 --> 00:57:18,304
minutes you more rounds.
So there's more variables because 

1214
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:21,820
there's 10,
nine rounds boxing.

1215
00:57:21,821 --> 00:57:23,830
The 10 point must system works.
People like it.

1216
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,710
I mean maybe it can be improved upon.
I'm not saying it couldn't be,

1217
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:31,030
but for MMA is woefully inadequate.
So they've created an updated system,

1218
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:33,550
but Nevada hasn't adapted.
Adopted it yet.

1219
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:34,423
Okay.
But when you go to vegas and you're 

1220
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:38,610
gigging gigging,
Daddy,

1221
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,510
you and you're gigging,
do you,

1222
00:57:40,511 --> 00:57:41,344
uh,
do you eat whatever you want today or 

1223
00:57:46,001 --> 00:57:46,450
this weekend?

1224
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:47,283
I had to it this weekend.
A Spaghetti I had like linguine with 

1225
00:57:50,051 --> 00:57:51,400
clams.
Nice.

1226
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:54,070
I fucked up.
So you need a Cuban sandwich?

1227
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:56,590
Grand Sunday night?
Yeah.

1228
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,930
I shitty food.
So I felt it today.

1229
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,433
So that's like,
people are so tired of hearing people 

1230
00:58:01,631 --> 00:58:05,230
complain about what they eating bad food
and what it does to your body.

1231
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:07,970
I think people have.
I've worn my welcome out with that stuff

1232
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,130
because I've talked about it too much on
my own.

1233
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:13,510
I definitely,
uh,

1234
00:58:13,511 --> 00:58:16,030
definitely indulge.
I had pizza on Sunday.

1235
00:58:16,031 --> 00:58:17,500
I had a lot of shitty food.
Yeah.

1236
00:58:17,501 --> 00:58:19,090
No because it's hard when you're on the 
road.

1237
00:58:19,091 --> 00:58:20,380
It's difficult to,
uh,

1238
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:21,843
to not do it.
And once you break the seal when you're 

1239
00:58:23,111 --> 00:58:23,891
on the road you're like,
oh,

1240
00:58:23,891 --> 00:58:26,140
I'll just clean it up when I get home.
Exactly.

1241
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,633
Yeah.
But,

1242
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:29,023
but I've been pretty consistent.
It's like diet and pretty consistent 

1243
00:58:31,691 --> 00:58:32,470
with working out.

1244
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:34,230
I was going to bring some bread today 
because I,

1245
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:35,223
I,
uh,

1246
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:38,560
I was experimenting with something and 
tried to make something different and it

1247
00:58:38,561 --> 00:58:40,530
was kind of a fail,
not a total fail.

1248
00:58:40,531 --> 00:58:43,210
It's still tastes good,
but it didn't look that great.

1249
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:45,370
And it was like I was going to bring it 
by and then I was like,

1250
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:46,263
Eh,
I don't think they're going to want to 

1251
00:58:47,351 --> 00:58:48,540
eat bread.
I think they're,

1252
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:51,940
I think they're dialed in right now.
I'm trying to be dialed in right now.

1253
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:53,103
I just think,
uh,

1254
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:56,830
I'm going to get myself one day a week,
one day a week to fuck off.

1255
00:58:56,831 --> 00:58:59,980
We're not always going to take it.
I'm not always going to take that day.

1256
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:00,903
And that was my,
I don't need it and don't go batshit 

1257
00:59:02,531 --> 00:59:03,460
crazy.
Well,

1258
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:05,320
here's the thing.
In Aubrey Marcus,

1259
00:59:05,321 --> 00:59:07,480
my good buddies described this the best 
way.

1260
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:08,621
He's like,
well,

1261
00:59:08,621 --> 00:59:13,621
you're doing is you're just for a few 
moments of mouth pleasure.

1262
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:19,090
You're totally hijacking your body for 
the next day.

1263
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:19,943
Yeah.
Like if you're eating like an ice cream 

1264
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:22,730
Sundae

1265
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:23,893
and you know,
you drink a coca cola with that and you 

1266
00:59:27,051 --> 00:59:29,740
have a cheeseburger and fries,
right?

1267
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:33,170
You are high jacking your digestive 
system.

1268
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,130
Yeah.
He just said,

1269
00:59:34,131 --> 00:59:36,350
listen,
I don't give a fuck what did for me.

1270
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:40,100
We're going to throw some groovy 
poisoned down there and I'm going to get

1271
00:59:40,101 --> 00:59:40,934
the shortest.
I mean like a few minutes of good 

1272
00:59:43,251 --> 00:59:44,084
feeling.
That doesn't come close to a lot of 

1273
00:59:45,201 --> 00:59:46,040
stuff.
That's legal.

1274
00:59:46,530 --> 00:59:48,380
It doesn't even come close.
Yeah.

1275
00:59:48,381 --> 00:59:49,214
But something's Kinda last.
Like when you've been thinking about 

1276
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:57,041
fried chicken for for a month or so,
and then you get that fried chicken,

1277
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,470
it'll stick with you for a bit.
Do you think you should earn it?

1278
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,780
Yeah,
I think it should be special.

1279
01:00:02,781 --> 01:00:05,240
I think it's gotta be like,
you know.

1280
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:06,390
Yeah.
I think it's.

1281
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:08,390
Yeah.
You're one of my all time favorite cheat

1282
01:00:08,391 --> 01:00:09,224
foods is,
is Popeye's fried chicken with hot 

1283
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:13,310
sauce.

1284
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:13,971
Hot.
Damn.

1285
01:00:13,971 --> 01:00:18,290
I take some fucking l you could take a 
Habanero sauce when it's cold.

1286
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:21,260
I like it the next day even more than I 
liked it better.

1287
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:22,483
Yeah.
And then dip it in the Habanero sauce 

1288
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:26,620
and just fucking gluten be damned.
Ah,

1289
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:31,720
you got to put a nice potato with that 
fuck potatoes on the side of that.

1290
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:38,300
Just going hard with fried chicken.
Fried chicken is two food groups.

1291
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:40,700
Okay.
It's bread and it's chicken,

1292
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,650
right?
Because all that crust on the outside of

1293
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:43,450
oil.
Yeah.

1294
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:44,283
Plenty of oil.
Got Fried Chicken at this food festival 

1295
01:00:47,601 --> 01:00:49,100
the other day.
I was like,

1296
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:51,200
oh,
I haven't had that in a long time.

1297
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:53,360
And it wasn't that great.
That's the worst.

1298
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:56,600
You know what the best chicken isn't?
California Roscoe's.

1299
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:58,760
Oh really?
Roscoe's chicken and waffles.

1300
01:00:58,830 --> 01:00:59,663
The just my eyes.
Maybe it's just the combination 

1301
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:03,673
combination of the chicken,
chicken and waffles and Syrup and 

1302
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:08,900
Collard Greens or something about 
Collard Greens.

1303
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:09,733
On the side column,
there's a place in a studio city called 

1304
01:01:12,861 --> 01:01:13,694
a uncle Andres and it's barbecue place.
Tiny little place one do just in the 

1305
01:01:18,681 --> 01:01:19,514
back making this stuff forever.
It looks like they took him out of 

1306
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:26,030
Alabama and the woods and he's just kick
ass makes them credible.

1307
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,193
His Collard Greens are insane because 
somebody's gotta learn how to cook 

1308
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,380
because when someone does it really 
well,

1309
01:01:33,381 --> 01:01:34,214
I got a really good barbecue place and 
it's like dripping when you pull it out 

1310
01:01:36,831 --> 01:01:38,420
of the box a little.
Yeah,

1311
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:41,420
a little liquid.
It's good stuff.

1312
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:45,500
It's a delicious vegetable and it's not 
like a well used one.

1313
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:46,880
No,
it's good for you.

1314
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:48,890
Fuck it.
Why anything green?

1315
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:50,440
Essentially.
It's good for you,

1316
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:51,030
right?
It's,

1317
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:53,390
you know,
they say that Bok Choy is something that

1318
01:01:53,391 --> 01:01:56,150
people are really getting into now for 
the health benefits.

1319
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:59,780
Bok Choy I'm going to do with that.
I'm a Kale Freak,

1320
01:01:59,781 --> 01:02:01,310
man.
I love it.

1321
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:03,730
Makes me feel good.
Kale does make you feel good.

1322
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:05,510
Love it.
It's really good.

1323
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:06,373
I had a.
there's this place called a blossom in 

1324
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:12,500
New York and it had this total Kale dish
and a.

1325
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:16,340
It was a lot of it and you just ate the 
whole thing and then you walk out.

1326
01:02:16,341 --> 01:02:17,174
You feel better than when you walked in 
the restaurant and you shit like a 

1327
01:02:19,501 --> 01:02:20,040
lumber

1328
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:25,040
accident.
Our river ship hit a rock.

1329
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,160
You want to take pictures and send it to
you?

1330
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:39,240
I'm proud of you little buddy.
What was that scene?

1331
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:40,223
Was it in dumb and dumber where he's 
holding on while he's taking a shit was 

1332
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,240
getting launched into the air.
Literally.

1333
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:50,040
Sometimes you just want to take a 
picture and share it with your friends.

1334
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:54,900
There's something about shit jokes,
man.

1335
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:59,460
Ari Shaffir had to get rid of his agent 
or a manager,

1336
01:02:59,461 --> 01:03:01,650
one of the to realize they told him to 
stop.

1337
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,513
Oh,
there it is right there on found the 

1338
01:03:03,381 --> 01:03:04,214
scene.

1339
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:11,580
Said so funny and such a child.
It's a primal thing,

1340
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:12,563
but already had this great joke about 
and it actually was a real thing that 

1341
01:03:15,601 --> 01:03:19,050
happened when he and I worked together,
he had to go over this bridge and it was

1342
01:03:19,051 --> 01:03:21,450
a long ass bridge in Sydney,
Australia,

1343
01:03:21,451 --> 01:03:23,820
and as he was halfway over the bridge,
he had shit himself.

1344
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:27,210
It takes forever to get to the other 
side.

1345
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:31,560
Just he stuck.
His manager was like,

1346
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:33,150
you shouldn't do that.
It's a shit joke.

1347
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:35,790
And I mean this joke.
Oh,

1348
01:03:35,791 --> 01:03:39,390
he had it in his act was a joke kit.
Eld killed.

1349
01:03:39,391 --> 01:03:41,680
He was closing with it,
you know,

1350
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:42,533
and his manager was telling him he 
shouldn't do it because it's a shit 

1351
01:03:44,071 --> 01:03:44,701
show.
And he was like,

1352
01:03:44,701 --> 01:03:46,460
yeah,
we're not going to be working.

1353
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:48,690
We can't,
we can't do this.

1354
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:51,960
We can't do this.
While I was just laughing at it.

1355
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,660
I was like,
I came to tell him I,

1356
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:54,990
I do the joke.
It's so funny.

1357
01:03:55,390 --> 01:03:58,230
It's so funny that you tell that story 
and it's fucking hilarious.

1358
01:03:58,530 --> 01:03:59,011
And he goes,
yeah,

1359
01:03:59,011 --> 01:04:02,190
I just had a fire my manager.
And he was,

1360
01:04:02,191 --> 01:04:03,090
yeah,
he told me to stop doing.

1361
01:04:03,091 --> 01:04:05,880
I go get the fuck out of here.
There's no way.

1362
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:07,480
He's like a.
because it wasn't,

1363
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:10,170
it was a joke about a guy who had to 
take a shit,

1364
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:12,690
but it wasn't just,
it was a,

1365
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:15,390
it was just funny.
It was a real story.

1366
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:20,160
And that concept is a real part of life.
It's not just theirs,

1367
01:04:20,161 --> 01:04:20,994
but there's people that think like 
there's toilet humor and there was a 

1368
01:04:22,531 --> 01:04:25,230
thing that like in the 19 sixties and 
seventies,

1369
01:04:25,231 --> 01:04:26,850
you know,
someone like Lenny Bruce came along,

1370
01:04:26,851 --> 01:04:27,390
Oh,
he's doing it.

1371
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:28,820
Toilet humor,
right.

1372
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:32,400
If it's coming out of somebody and all 
they have is that,

1373
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:34,220
and there's nothing if it's coming from 
ru,

1374
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:37,090
like he's a funny comedian,
you know,

1375
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:39,480
and it's just a subject,
you're just a real subject.

1376
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:44,900
But I was talking about how it's hard to
be a human being and I had this like run

1377
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:46,300
and I said,
uh,

1378
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:49,410
you ever Fart so loud and your sleep,
you wake yourself up.

1379
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:52,350
And I was like,
wow,

1380
01:04:52,351 --> 01:04:53,184
this is so base.
Like I know normally have talked like 

1381
01:04:56,251 --> 01:04:57,084
that in my act and it's just so fun to 
talk about and the girls just get 

1382
01:05:00,091 --> 01:05:02,130
hysterical in the audience because they 
do.

1383
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:04,600
It's just too much fun to talk about.
Oh,

1384
01:05:04,601 --> 01:05:07,830
why?
Why else are we here to enjoy ourselves?

1385
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:09,210
You know what I mean?
I can't be like,

1386
01:05:09,211 --> 01:05:10,044
no,
I mean I'm not going to do it on Cole 

1387
01:05:11,521 --> 01:05:12,500
Bear,
but you know,

1388
01:05:12,810 --> 01:05:15,070
it's fun to do at Ice House.
I mean,

1389
01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:17,950
it is a thing they put.
It's a thing that

1390
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:20,950
you should certainly use it sparingly,
right?

1391
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:22,360
If you're going to describe it and talk 
about it,

1392
01:05:22,361 --> 01:05:23,800
like what is this guy obsessed with 
shit,

1393
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:25,780
right?
Because vic is your computer.

1394
01:05:25,781 --> 01:05:27,100
Jesus,
look at his bookmarks.

1395
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:31,420
Oh God,
I accidentally so many fucking retweeted

1396
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:35,200
a scat page.
There's a scale twitter page.

1397
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:38,230
Somebody retweeted it and I was like,
why is this on my feet?

1398
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:39,693
It was some dude with these giant hairy 
fat overweight ass hunched over this 

1399
01:05:44,531 --> 01:05:45,364
woman's face and hitting in her mouth 
while people were like pulling the shit 

1400
01:05:49,001 --> 01:05:51,820
out of his ass and run it face.
And I was like,

1401
01:05:51,821 --> 01:05:56,821
this is on twitter,
but Milo's not your guys' band,

1402
01:05:56,891 --> 01:06:00,460
Milo Yiannopoulos and this is like,
whoa.

1403
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,070
Oh that's terrible.
I'm like,

1404
01:06:03,071 --> 01:06:06,820
what in the fuck am I looking at?
How was that?

1405
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:09,160
And also there's a lot of porn on 
twitter.

1406
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:10,950
Not really.
Yeah,

1407
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,310
like fight a hardcore.

1408
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:15,610
I don't read the twitter feed anymore.
I don't.

1409
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:19,570
I'll read like mentioned like with fans 
that want to talk about stuff,

1410
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,870
but I,
I've known through everybody else.

1411
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:24,093
No,
it's just,

1412
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:25,360
well,
yes,

1413
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:27,280
it just got too much.
It's just,

1414
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,273
it was overwhelming.
I'd rather just talk to people about 

1415
01:06:29,891 --> 01:06:30,724
bread recipes and.
Well there's too much information and 

1416
01:06:33,881 --> 01:06:36,700
for sure we're definitely suffering from
an overload of information.

1417
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:39,670
I just feel better because it's just too
much to go through.

1418
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:40,563
It's just instagram is good.
You see a couple of pictures of your 

1419
01:06:42,881 --> 01:06:45,290
friends.
I feel like if something really crazy is

1420
01:06:45,291 --> 01:06:46,390
happening,
someone will text me.

1421
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:47,860
Yeah.
Yeah.

1422
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:51,760
Something really crazy.
Like Erin Foster,

1423
01:06:51,761 --> 01:06:54,760
the guy who's coming tomorrow who thinks
he can kill a wolf with his hands.

1424
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,520
He's going to be on a podcast tomorrow.
Oh yeah.

1425
01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:58,330
Former NFL player.
Has he done it?

1426
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:00,910
No,
he never has killed a man by the way.

1427
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:03,450
No one's killed wolf with their hands 
up.

1428
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:04,990
Giant super athlete.
And he's like,

1429
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:08,260
I'll get.
He said if he gets a hold of its neck,

1430
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,240
it'll be done.
So that's what he said.

1431
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:14,740
I'm like,
I'm not entirely sure he understands how

1432
01:07:14,741 --> 01:07:16,060
big that NEC is.
Well,

1433
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,610
I don't think he understands how fast 
those things move.

1434
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:19,473
How vicious they are.
They have a bite that's five times 

1435
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:23,560
harder than a pit bulls.
Oh No.

1436
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:24,750
Yeah,
I was uh,

1437
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:27,790
I was,
I joined the wolf movement when I was in

1438
01:07:27,791 --> 01:07:30,770
college was around the time it was like 
saving the wolves because the numbers of

1439
01:07:30,771 --> 01:07:32,980
guns so low.
So what year was this?

1440
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:35,980
This was a like a 89,
88.

1441
01:07:35,981 --> 01:07:37,870
So that was before the yellowstone 
reintroduction?

1442
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,460
Yes.
It was all part of that.

1443
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:40,550
Oh.
And uh,

1444
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,030
everyone's just pouring money and effort
into,

1445
01:07:43,031 --> 01:07:44,800
you know,
talking about it and stuff.

1446
01:07:44,801 --> 01:07:45,790
And uh,
we were,

1447
01:07:46,050 --> 01:07:51,050
me and my friends were so into wolves 
were just like we'd watch wolf videos,

1448
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:52,323
wolf packs.
We loved like the packs and the healthy 

1449
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:57,100
would hunt and like go around different 
things.

1450
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:01,360
And then now the wolf is a dominant 
again.

1451
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:04,270
It's kind of exploded a little bit of a 
problem,

1452
01:08:04,271 --> 01:08:05,530
right?
In some areas.

1453
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:09,730
But most in most areas they think it's 
like it's healthy.

1454
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:10,511
It is good.
Yeah.

1455
01:08:10,511 --> 01:08:12,070
Like they think it's healthy in 
yellowstone.

1456
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:15,800
Like people are upset that live on the 
outside of it because they weren't given

1457
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:16,370
a say

1458
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:17,780
and they,
there's a lot of wolves.

1459
01:08:17,781 --> 01:08:19,820
Now there's a real,
it's a real thing.

1460
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:21,193
And as long as the elk populations are 
high and they manage the wolf 

1461
01:08:24,681 --> 01:08:26,600
populations,
that's where it gets squirrely.

1462
01:08:26,601 --> 01:08:27,434
Some,
some people don't want anyone to kill 

1463
01:08:28,251 --> 01:08:30,110
wolves.
Like you say,

1464
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:31,850
well why would you kill a wolf?
Man?

1465
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:35,000
The problem is if you get the,
they get over populated,

1466
01:08:35,001 --> 01:08:35,834
you have a real problem,
like I agree and beautiful and I think 

1467
01:08:37,911 --> 01:08:39,110
they're amazing.
They'll probably like,

1468
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:44,120
if I had like one animal that I would be
like most psyched to see in the wild,

1469
01:08:44,190 --> 01:08:46,760
it would be a wolf.
I think they're incredible for sure.

1470
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:47,653
I'm fascinated by them,
but I'm also really aware of what the 

1471
01:08:51,321 --> 01:08:53,030
consequences are.
If there's too many of them,

1472
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,300
they'll eat people.
They definitely eat people they've eaten

1473
01:08:56,710 --> 01:08:58,520
at many times in the past eight dogs.

1474
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:00,320
There's some pictures that someone sent 
me.

1475
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:01,573
Um,
his buddies and Kazic Stan had three 

1476
01:09:04,191 --> 01:09:05,024
dogs killed the night by wolves and they
ate the dogs and they have pictures of 

1477
01:09:09,321 --> 01:09:12,230
the remains of these dogs were,
they're bitten in half,

1478
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:13,243
like the lower abdomen.
Like you could see everything from the 

1479
01:09:15,801 --> 01:09:17,840
shoulders up,
like the dog's head,

1480
01:09:17,841 --> 01:09:20,570
the dogs arms,
and then everything back there is gone.

1481
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,930
They cut it in half.
She's there.

1482
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:26,300
The amount of power they generate in 
their jaws,

1483
01:09:26,301 --> 01:09:28,970
he's insane and they don't look at dogs 
like their buddies.

1484
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:32,140
They look at dogs like pray and they'll 
look at people like prayed.

1485
01:09:32,141 --> 01:09:32,974
Yeah,
if there's.

1486
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:34,670
If they don't think that you're 
dangerous,

1487
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:35,930
they'll get you.
They'll get you.

1488
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:39,080
There's coyote is all around us and 
we'll get you to.

1489
01:09:39,081 --> 01:09:40,790
If everything gets.
If it gets real bad.

1490
01:09:40,791 --> 01:09:41,700
Yeah.
We know someone who would.

1491
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:44,600
The coyote went in the house and got the
dog.

1492
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:45,830
Oh my God.
Yeah.

1493
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,210
Little dog winning got it off.

1494
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:49,893
Oh,

1495
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:52,160
they're scary.
Yeah.

1496
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:54,010
They're scary.
Who has a stronger bite?

1497
01:09:54,011 --> 01:09:55,840
A Wolf or a bear?
Grizzly bear.

1498
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:57,340
A grizzly bear.
Yeah.

1499
01:09:57,341 --> 01:09:58,930
Not even close.
Not even close.

1500
01:09:58,970 --> 01:09:59,803
No.
A real like if you're talking like a 

1501
01:10:02,261 --> 01:10:04,480
Kodiak Island grizzly bear,
that's the biggest they get.

1502
01:10:04,690 --> 01:10:07,930
They're not really grizzly grizzlies.
There's two bears,

1503
01:10:07,931 --> 01:10:08,764
right?
There's a brown bear and a grizzly bear 

1504
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:11,680
and the grizzly bears,
the interior bear.

1505
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:13,690
That's the bear that you find in the 
rocky mountain.

1506
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:15,320
That's a grizzly bear,
right?

1507
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:16,850
The,
the burial.

1508
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:17,703
Find a Montana,
but the coastal bears are even bigger 

1509
01:10:20,141 --> 01:10:21,850
and that's what they had to kill in 
California.

1510
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:22,873
You know,
our state flag has a brown bear on it 

1511
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,660
and that brown bear that's different.
Gene Brown and Grizzly st animal,

1512
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:32,200
but one of them lives interior and it's 
much more aggressive.

1513
01:10:32,201 --> 01:10:33,034
By the way,
the Grizzly is much scarier than the 

1514
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:37,810
coastal bear because the coastal bear 
gets plenty of food.

1515
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,540
That's why they're so big and the other 
one's hungry.

1516
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:43,450
Yeah,
so coastal bears are enormous.

1517
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:44,373
I mean enormous.
And the biggest ones on the planet that 

1518
01:10:47,231 --> 01:10:48,064
are brown bears,
the biggest bears in the planet right 

1519
01:10:49,481 --> 01:10:51,970
now are polar bears.
Polar bears,

1520
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:52,893
but the brown bears on Kodiak Island,
I think they get too close to 2000 

1521
01:10:57,611 --> 01:11:02,530
pounds.
Like find out what's the brown bear ever

1522
01:11:02,531 --> 01:11:04,230
shot on Kodiak Island?
They,

1523
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:05,143
I think it might be close to 12 feet 
tall and I think it might be in the 

1524
01:11:08,981 --> 01:11:12,130
neighborhood of 1800 to 2000 pounds.
She's,

1525
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:14,310
I you,
that time when I was hiking

1526
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:18,060
in Alaska and I was close to a bear who 
accidentally.

1527
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:19,890
Yeah,
yeah,

1528
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,320
girl or a boy,
I don't know.

1529
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:25,410
Black or brown.
It was a kind of Tan.

1530
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,640
Tan.
Yeah,

1531
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:29,850
probably it was in Alaska,
like probably a black bear.

1532
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:31,790
They have the color phase.
Black bears there.

1533
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:34,530
It was big.
It looked like the size of a minivan.

1534
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,240
Oh Jesus.
So it was probably a grizzly though.

1535
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:37,500
It was big.
Yeah.

1536
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:38,880
So really big.
Yeah.

1537
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:41,300
And it was coming through the weeds.
God,

1538
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:44,340
that was with my.
We were in the back country.

1539
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:48,960
We were out there like miles and miles 
in like overnight for like a week.

1540
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:53,670
Oh Jesus up.
And it was reads like as tall as me,

1541
01:11:53,671 --> 01:11:57,370
like a whole field of those reads and we
just saw the,

1542
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:58,813
the,
the reeds just partying like 50 feet 

1543
01:12:01,081 --> 01:12:04,020
away,
like oh my God.

1544
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,080
And I'm with like five other people and 
you're not supposed to run when they see

1545
01:12:07,081 --> 01:12:08,490
a bear,
you're supposed to freeze.

1546
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:10,253
Everybody took off.
They just got so scared and me and my 

1547
01:12:13,981 --> 01:12:18,060
one friend's froze and then saw them 
running and we went to bat.

1548
01:12:18,061 --> 01:12:18,894
We were like,
kind of in between the instinct of what 

1549
01:12:20,221 --> 01:12:21,054
to do.
The bear was like where the corner of 

1550
01:12:22,681 --> 01:12:25,350
that room is and just was,
it was late September.

1551
01:12:25,351 --> 01:12:26,790
It was full.
Oh yeah.

1552
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,430
It was going way down to get the last 
berries,

1553
01:12:29,431 --> 01:12:31,350
like way down low.
And uh,

1554
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:32,730
it was,
uh,

1555
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:34,930
didn't care about us at all.
It just,

1556
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:37,800
but you realize it

1557
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:42,400
like in a split second if this guy 
decides this is a whole different story,

1558
01:12:42,970 --> 01:12:45,310
you know what I mean?
They can move so fast,

1559
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,600
so fast.
Okay.

1560
01:12:46,601 --> 01:12:50,650
The biggest brown bear,
the world record was bagged by Roy.

1561
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:51,613
I like how they say bagged.
Just say killed Roy Lindsley in 1950 

1562
01:12:56,951 --> 01:12:59,650
2:30
12 slash 16.

1563
01:12:59,651 --> 01:13:01,060
I don't know what that means.
A score.

1564
01:13:01,061 --> 01:13:03,790
Largest scoring.
Where's the size of it?

1565
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:06,130
I don't know.
It doesn't say 30 feet long.

1566
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:08,260
They're just scroll down,
scroll down.

1567
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:10,090
No,
it's definitely not 30 feet long.

1568
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,080
Twelve feet?
No,

1569
01:13:11,081 --> 01:13:11,651
I think.
No,

1570
01:13:11,651 --> 01:13:12,131
they're,
they're,

1571
01:13:12,131 --> 01:13:15,910
they're actually measuring the skull.
I think eight cups.

1572
01:13:15,970 --> 01:13:19,150
I think there may have measuring the 
skull and then 16.

1573
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:20,860
Who knows what that is?
Maybe it's the length.

1574
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:22,023
Yeah.
Just trying to find out what that meant 

1575
01:13:22,311 --> 01:13:23,570
on here.
I didn't really see anything.

1576
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:28,360
Just just look up how big or how much 
does the biggest Kodiak bear way?

1577
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:31,780
Just Google that says it weighed more 
than half a ton.

1578
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,960
Oh,
that's a big bag.

1579
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:36,640
Says commonly way more than half a time.
Yeah.

1580
01:13:36,670 --> 01:13:39,250
I mean that's just a thousand pounds.
Yeah.

1581
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:41,470
I hate this website.
This website blows,

1582
01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:44,410
Bro.
Ever.

1583
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,360
I think that's one of them.
Hunter websites,

1584
01:13:46,361 --> 01:13:48,610
right?
Is it bears my favorite animal though?

1585
01:13:48,611 --> 01:13:50,200
Outdoor hub.com.
Yeah.

1586
01:13:50,201 --> 01:13:51,700
See that's like,
wow.

1587
01:13:52,330 --> 01:13:54,610
Oh my God.
That can't be real thing.

1588
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:55,623
One thousand to 1200 pounds can weigh up
to 1500 pounds when conditions are 

1589
01:13:58,601 --> 01:13:59,860
right.
That's not real.

1590
01:13:59,861 --> 01:14:01,180
Look at the size of that head.
Oh,

1591
01:14:01,181 --> 01:14:02,320
that's real.
That's real.

1592
01:14:02,321 --> 01:14:03,370
Yeah.
It's perspective though.

1593
01:14:03,371 --> 01:14:05,860
The guys behind it and he's like hiding 
out like three feet behind.

1594
01:14:05,861 --> 01:14:08,840
The barely got killed her so big and I'm
is the.

1595
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:12,150
That's

1596
01:14:12,150 --> 01:14:13,090
a heavy rock.
Adam.

1597
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:18,130
Stick that dire wolf skull.
This is what a Dork I am.

1598
01:14:18,131 --> 01:14:20,590
I recognize that.
That's not a dinosaur.

1599
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:22,200
Which one?
No,

1600
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:23,860
it's as mammals.
What is that animal?

1601
01:14:23,861 --> 01:14:26,560
Is that a dire wolf?
A look at those teeth.

1602
01:14:26,561 --> 01:14:28,230
Sun.
Ooh.

1603
01:14:28,231 --> 01:14:29,980
It looks like my dog.
Good Lord.

1604
01:14:29,981 --> 01:14:32,020
Look at those fucking teeth.
What is that?

1605
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:35,260
A visit page.
What the fuck animal is that?

1606
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,240
It was a parakeet.
What does it say?

1607
01:14:37,241 --> 01:14:39,040
It says the hell pig.
Hell pig.

1608
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:40,920
Oh hell.
Helping.

1609
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:42,970
I just found out about this thing a week
ago.

1610
01:14:42,971 --> 01:14:45,750
I never heard of it.
A hell click on that motherfucker,

1611
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,760
please.
I'm learning new things.

1612
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:52,630
This was apparently like a super 
predator giant pig,

1613
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:54,970
mean fucking huge.
There was a um,

1614
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,353
was an article like really recently,
like within the last couple of days on 

1615
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:00,394
it that I saw online were there were say
thank God the hell pig gets extinct or 

1616
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,384
something like that.

1617
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:09,310
But it was a fucking huge.
It was a huge animal.

1618
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:11,800
They haven't seen my family on 
thanksgiving.

1619
01:15:11,801 --> 01:15:16,270
Hello Bob.
Hello pig.

1620
01:15:16,271 --> 01:15:18,670
Wow.
Facts about the giant killer pigs.

1621
01:15:18,671 --> 01:15:21,250
Look at the face on that fucking thing.
Look at its haunches.

1622
01:15:21,251 --> 01:15:24,040
It's like a bowl.
It's like a bull horse.

1623
01:15:24,041 --> 01:15:27,260
Facteau horse that fucked a wolf.
Yeah,

1624
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:28,580
right?
Yeah.

1625
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:30,730
Like a bull horse wolf thing.
Yeah.

1626
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:33,400
Face.
It was like a tank of a face.

1627
01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:35,740
Oh God.
Let's imagine that thing running at your

1628
01:15:35,741 --> 01:15:37,270
family.
What do you do?

1629
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,430
He's closer to Hippos and Wales.
You Push,

1630
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:43,810
you push the smallest one into it and 
run to devolution.

1631
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:47,710
Scares the fuck out of me closest to 
hippos and whale.

1632
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:49,900
We're here.
Definitely a good time.

1633
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:52,900
A hippo whale thing.
That was huge.

1634
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:57,390
I mean they were a hippo size too.
And I think this was a thing,

1635
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:59,290
correct me if I'm wrong,
we're this thing live.

1636
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:00,910
He lived around people,
right?

1637
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:02,613
Joe,
would you rather live in a world where 

1638
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:07,900
2000 pounds with all of nature is being 
decimated and we're.

1639
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:11,230
And we're drilling in national parks and
it's really bleak.

1640
01:16:11,231 --> 01:16:12,064
Like everything's concrete or would you 
like to live in a time like this where 

1641
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:20,440
hell pigs are running around and you had
to fight for your life the whole time?

1642
01:16:20,770 --> 01:16:21,603
Depends on what you mean.
If I had to live back then with the 

1643
01:16:23,411 --> 01:16:27,010
weapons they had back then because what 
year is this that this was going down?

1644
01:16:27,130 --> 01:16:30,130
These were times when did this thing 
exists?

1645
01:16:30,330 --> 01:16:32,290
Nineteen to $16.
Million years.

1646
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:33,280
Okay.
So there's no people.

1647
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:37,180
No,
let's put them in modern day.

1648
01:16:37,210 --> 01:16:40,660
So if there wasn't an animal back then 
that was like us,

1649
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:42,570
it's past the,
um,

1650
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:48,020
the big impact that you could on impact.
So that's 65 million years ago,

1651
01:16:49,241 --> 01:16:50,074
so there's.
Those are probably like weird monkey 

1652
01:16:52,451 --> 01:16:54,670
people.
Back then they didn't have.

1653
01:16:54,671 --> 01:16:56,380
They probably they were fucked.
Let's update it.

1654
01:16:56,381 --> 01:16:57,214
Let's let's say the EPA is granted all 
of the things I wanted to be able to do 

1655
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:03,550
and the place is just crazy with 
animals,

1656
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:06,220
but we have held pigs,
pigs in your garbage.

1657
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:10,280
See that's where got guards and stuff 
like that.

1658
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:12,500
People are going to be happy that 
there's people that know how to hunt

1659
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:16,630
because if there really are hell pigs 
and they really do become a problem,

1660
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:17,703
look,
the only thing that's keeping wolf 

1661
01:17:18,371 --> 01:17:20,890
populations down as hunters and when 
they don't have that,

1662
01:17:20,891 --> 01:17:23,110
you know what they do in Alaska,
they get an airplanes,

1663
01:17:23,111 --> 01:17:25,030
they fly over him and they shoot them 
from the sky.

1664
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,433
They find the packs,
they locate them and they swooped down 

1665
01:17:28,181 --> 01:17:29,014
and shoot at them when they killed too 
many Caribou or they killed too many 

1666
01:17:32,261 --> 01:17:33,094
moose.
What would happen if they didn't do 

1667
01:17:33,761 --> 01:17:35,230
that?
They would get overwhelmed.

1668
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:38,050
They have massive populations of like 
they have in Siberia.

1669
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:39,673
Siberia.
A few years ago they were having these 

1670
01:17:40,811 --> 01:17:41,644
super packs of wolves because it was a 
particularly horrible winter and it 

1671
01:17:44,101 --> 01:17:44,934
would have like 100 wolf could,
would get together so they could take 

1672
01:17:46,571 --> 01:17:47,404
out horses,
so they would go into these barns and 

1673
01:17:50,081 --> 01:17:50,914
then imagine you're hanging out in your 
house and your barn is next door and 

1674
01:17:54,401 --> 01:17:58,210
there's 100 wolves apart,
100 walls,

1675
01:17:58,230 --> 01:17:58,520
right?

1676
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:02,330
So it's okay if we kill a couple of 
things.

1677
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:04,670
You have to.
It's survival well if you don't,

1678
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:05,710
they're going to get.
They're going to get.

1679
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:06,803
Or with the Russians in World War One,
the Russians and the Germans in World 

1680
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:11,460
War One.
So many of them were killed by wolves,

1681
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:15,730
that they had a ceasefire and they 
decided to kill wolves for real and they

1682
01:18:15,731 --> 01:18:18,990
went and they went back to killing each 
other after they figured out how many.

1683
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:21,510
They sorted it out and killed a ton of 
walls

1684
01:18:22,510 --> 01:18:25,120
and this friend that's coming tomorrow 
says he can kill him with his hands.

1685
01:18:25,121 --> 01:18:25,954
He believes he seems incorrect.
I think this thing people have this 

1686
01:18:29,591 --> 01:18:32,770
thing in their head and a wolf is like a
dog to kill a dog.

1687
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,840
If he's a giant dude and the,
you know,

1688
01:18:34,850 --> 01:18:38,050
the dog doesn't bite him in the right 
spot and he can get ahold of it's neck.

1689
01:18:38,051 --> 01:18:39,940
He might be able to kill a dog.
Could kill a dog.

1690
01:18:40,030 --> 01:18:42,340
I'd bet you might be able to kill some 
dogs.

1691
01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:44,230
My lab.
Yeah.

1692
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:47,980
Which puppy do you have a knife with you
when this is going down in Sirhan's?

1693
01:18:48,130 --> 01:18:49,810
Choke it out.
Not Easy.

1694
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:50,793
Not Easy.
Not Easy to kill an animal with your 

1695
01:18:51,821 --> 01:18:53,050
hands.
You suffocate it.

1696
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:55,960
Choker hold very hard.
It was going to be very hard to do.

1697
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:57,400
Yeah.
Very hard dog.

1698
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:58,420
Yeah,
very hard.

1699
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:01,570
Have you seen my hands?
You have giant hands,

1700
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:03,730
like a massive,
massive football player,

1701
01:19:03,731 --> 01:19:04,710
man.
Um,

1702
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,450
if you learn,
know Jujitsu and you get it back and you

1703
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:10,300
can sync the choke in like a real proper
rear naked choke,

1704
01:19:10,301 --> 01:19:11,134
you might be able to kill it.
But I would think you would put it to 

1705
01:19:12,701 --> 01:19:14,670
sleep and then stomp it's head,
right?

1706
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:15,910
It'd be the move.
Yeah.

1707
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:17,750
You got to wear boots if you're going 
dog hunting.

1708
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:18,643
Yeah.

1709
01:19:21,310 --> 01:19:24,160
Well it's,
it's like an animal that we've chosen.

1710
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:25,110
Again,
you know,

1711
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:25,943
this is an animal that.
This is our animal because they eat 

1712
01:19:27,911 --> 01:19:28,750
them,
right?

1713
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:31,000
Can't.
But if you go to China,

1714
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:33,040
they have a whole festival.
You know,

1715
01:19:33,041 --> 01:19:36,760
you can eat dogs just like pigs.
Yeah,

1716
01:19:36,761 --> 01:19:37,594
man.
I mean they're supposed to be the 

1717
01:19:38,290 --> 01:19:40,060
smartest pigs.
Yeah,

1718
01:19:40,061 --> 01:19:40,894
you're right.
My dog is definitely not as smart as a 

1719
01:19:43,151 --> 01:19:46,510
pig.
Dogs and idiot.

1720
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:48,280
I love her.
She's fun.

1721
01:19:48,281 --> 01:19:49,720
We just got her.
She's great,

1722
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:50,613
but a not bright.
Do you remember when people were having 

1723
01:19:52,511 --> 01:19:53,860
pigs for pets?
Yes.

1724
01:19:53,861 --> 01:19:55,210
It was like a thing.
Yes.

1725
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,800
Everyone had pop up.
Not everyone,

1726
01:19:56,801 --> 01:19:58,960
but a lot of people.
Pop belly pigs.

1727
01:19:58,961 --> 01:19:59,920
What happened?
All those pigs.

1728
01:19:59,921 --> 01:20:03,220
I bet they're not doing that great old 
farting in the house.

1729
01:20:04,410 --> 01:20:08,040
It's a pig barely hanging on.
What

1730
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:08,873
do they do with those pegs?
You're bring them outside and just let 

1731
01:20:10,591 --> 01:20:12,800
them go.
What do you do with those pigs?

1732
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:15,470
My dog got picked up from Bakersfield.
Yeah.

1733
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:17,610
A lot of people dump dogs and 
Bakersfield.

1734
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:19,103
Bakersfield.
Because it's open and you can just pull 

1735
01:20:20,851 --> 01:20:24,060
off the highway and throw a tennis ball 
and keep going.

1736
01:20:25,050 --> 01:20:26,610
It's that terrible.
God.

1737
01:20:26,611 --> 01:20:28,650
People are assholes.
They the worst.

1738
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:31,170
That's so fun.
I really so sad.

1739
01:20:31,470 --> 01:20:34,260
I could not imagine.
I mean sometimes I get mad at my dog,

1740
01:20:34,261 --> 01:20:36,360
but not to the point of driving it 
somewhere.

1741
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:37,383
You hear those stories about someone 
checking a bag of puppies out their car 

1742
01:20:39,781 --> 01:20:40,710
window and you're like,
wait,

1743
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:41,573
what?
My dog was a puppy that might've 

1744
01:20:42,811 --> 01:20:44,850
happened.
Oh yeah.

1745
01:20:44,851 --> 01:20:45,684
Just a whole bag of puppies.
You couldn't do something else that's 

1746
01:20:47,911 --> 01:20:48,744
just dumb and lazy.
You couldn't walk into a shelter and be 

1747
01:20:51,001 --> 01:20:52,320
like,
here's some puppies for you.

1748
01:20:52,410 --> 01:20:53,930
What's worse and dumb and lazy.
It's.

1749
01:20:54,210 --> 01:20:58,170
It's so fucking callous.
Yeah.

1750
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,730
Like how do you not feel?
Get a puppy.

1751
01:20:59,731 --> 01:21:00,690
You don't get excited.
Like,

1752
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:01,553
oh,
well that's how they know you're a 

1753
01:21:03,241 --> 01:21:04,140
psychopath,
right?

1754
01:21:04,141 --> 01:21:06,120
When you're a kid.
It was always the kid that would torture

1755
01:21:06,121 --> 01:21:08,340
animals.
They were concerned about that kid.

1756
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,340
There was a kid in my class who tied a 
bird up once.

1757
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:12,750
No,
a cat tight.

1758
01:21:12,790 --> 01:21:15,630
A cat like spread eagle and went to town
on it.

1759
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,910
Yeah,
he went away for awhile that.

1760
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:20,791
Well,
he was weird.

1761
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:23,110
He was doing weird stuff all the time 
and then they.

1762
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:26,070
Then the cat story got around and 
they're like,

1763
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:27,420
all right,
someone's got to.

1764
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:28,493
Someone's got to do something with.
This guy's getting weird because that's 

1765
01:21:30,421 --> 01:21:32,730
a sign that you'll do.
You'll hurt human beings.

1766
01:21:32,731 --> 01:21:36,840
You don't.
You're missing an empathy that makes you

1767
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:37,830
able to kill things.

1768
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:39,330
I don't know if you were around back 
then,

1769
01:21:39,331 --> 01:21:42,990
but there was some,
someone in life and men want to say like

1770
01:21:42,991 --> 01:21:46,620
the early two thousands maybe.
Maybe like even before that,

1771
01:21:46,621 --> 01:21:50,160
like maybe late nineties someone was 
killing cats and Hollywood.

1772
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:52,410
Oh really?
I don't know if they ever caught the guy

1773
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:53,760
really.
And by the way,

1774
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:54,623
no how I said guy,
because I'm sexist and I know that most 

1775
01:21:57,601 --> 01:22:00,050
people that kill cats are fucking guys.
Yeah.

1776
01:22:00,270 --> 01:22:03,480
But this guy was killing cats and 
cutting them open and like,

1777
01:22:03,481 --> 01:22:04,890
I'm like,
you know,

1778
01:22:04,891 --> 01:22:07,470
like gutting them and shit.
Like really?

1779
01:22:07,471 --> 01:22:08,101
Yay.
Yeah.

1780
01:22:08,101 --> 01:22:08,934
Like oh my God.
Almost like he was doing like science 

1781
01:22:10,951 --> 01:22:13,890
projects on like spreading them open,
holding their guts out.

1782
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:14,903
Yeah.
And people would come outside and they 

1783
01:22:15,391 --> 01:22:16,224
would find their cat not just dead but 
dead and surgically cut open and pulled 

1784
01:22:20,701 --> 01:22:22,350
apart and oh my God.

1785
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:23,460
Yeah.
It was scary.

1786
01:22:23,461 --> 01:22:25,350
That's a guy you want to feed into a 
wolf.

1787
01:22:25,450 --> 01:22:27,660
Yeah.
Some people were speculating though that

1788
01:22:27,661 --> 01:22:30,510
they were wrong and that it was really.
Coyotes were getting these dogs.

1789
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:31,111
Well,
you know,

1790
01:22:31,111 --> 01:22:35,400
what else does that guts cats and leaves
them a raccoons.

1791
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:36,990
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1792
01:22:36,991 --> 01:22:40,080
My neighbor's cat was killed like a 
raccoon that way and they don't eat it.

1793
01:22:40,081 --> 01:22:43,470
They just kill it and gutted it.
Will raccoons are predators.

1794
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:44,453
Yeah.
Record was trying to get into my 

1795
01:22:45,091 --> 01:22:45,924
chickens.
There was a raccoon on the other night 

1796
01:22:47,191 --> 01:22:48,750
trying to get at my chicken.
Yeah.

1797
01:22:48,751 --> 01:22:50,340
He wouldn't even fucking leave,
man.

1798
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:52,070
There was trying to scare him.
No,

1799
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:53,880
I was trying to scare him.
I was like,

1800
01:22:53,881 --> 01:22:55,650
bitch,
you better get the fuck away from here.

1801
01:22:55,651 --> 01:22:56,484
And he just looked at me and I got 
closer to him and he got closer to me 

1802
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:01,410
was like,
oh my God,

1803
01:23:01,411 --> 01:23:05,130
I will fucking get a bow and Arrow and I
will kill you if you kill my chickens.

1804
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:05,973
You can't

1805
01:23:06,970 --> 01:23:11,080
because this chickens are like their 
pets and their pets that live outside.

1806
01:23:11,270 --> 01:23:12,103
Just fucking guy was hanging around by 
the cage looking right at the chickens 

1807
01:23:14,681 --> 01:23:17,830
trying to figure out how to get at him.
And he'll figure it out to their smart.

1808
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:20,170
Will he uh,
he'll come back.

1809
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,650
Oh Man.
Yeah.

1810
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:26,830
Probably take them out there.
Allowed to.

1811
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:28,960
How's that work?
I would have to check what the laws are.

1812
01:23:28,961 --> 01:23:31,420
I think if it's on your property,
he allowed to kill raccoons.

1813
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:33,260
I bet you're not just allowed to just 
kill him.

1814
01:23:33,410 --> 01:23:34,160
He said,
well,

1815
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:35,740
you got to call someone to have them 
trapped them.

1816
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:36,281
Well,
first of all,

1817
01:23:36,281 --> 01:23:37,114
I have to make sure he's in a place 
where I can actually hit them with an 

1818
01:23:38,501 --> 01:23:39,334
Arrow ethically,
like I have to be able to actually make 

1819
01:23:42,761 --> 01:23:44,770
sure there's nothing behind him,
you know?

1820
01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:45,743
I don't want to miss and have an Arrow 
go through my neighbor's window because 

1821
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,550
I'm playing Robin Hood,
my backyard with a fucking.

1822
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:53,610
You know what you're doing now?
I do,

1823
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:54,453
but.
But you want to make sure there's 

1824
01:23:55,601 --> 01:23:56,434
nothing behind.
So he would have to be in an area of my 

1825
01:23:57,851 --> 01:24:01,600
yard where I would shoot a target or 
there's like a back wall,

1826
01:24:01,630 --> 01:24:02,463
you know,
so like I have to be somewhere where I 

1827
01:24:03,431 --> 01:24:04,264
could.
Yeah.

1828
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:08,800
But the arrows you used to go after elk,
would it go right through a raccoon?

1829
01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:12,070
Oh yeah.
Oh my God.

1830
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,680
An Lte.
So big.

1831
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:15,543
It would go right through.
The elks are a thousand pound animal 

1832
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:19,780
going to be like,
what was that?

1833
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:22,260
Elk have these huge bones.
Man.

1834
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:24,370
These arrows just plough right through 
those bones.

1835
01:24:24,371 --> 01:24:25,450
Really?
Oh yeah.

1836
01:24:25,451 --> 01:24:28,420
The only thing they have a hard time 
going through is the really thick,

1837
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:32,380
big ones like shoulder bones scapula 
sometimes give your.

1838
01:24:32,570 --> 01:24:35,290
Is Not that powerful like ribs.
They,

1839
01:24:35,330 --> 01:24:37,990
they all the time you get what's called 
a pass through.

1840
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:38,973
Where's the Arrow goes completely 
through the animal before it even knows 

1841
01:24:40,961 --> 01:24:43,450
what happened.
She says it happened so quick,

1842
01:24:43,810 --> 01:24:46,120
it's just like one second.
They don't have no,

1843
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:46,983
they don't even know what hit him.
That's for would rip a raccoon and half 

1844
01:24:51,650 --> 01:24:52,483
today,
or I'm developing some mechanical 

1845
01:24:54,611 --> 01:24:57,550
advantage because the cams,
so they're there on the compound,

1846
01:24:57,551 --> 01:24:58,384
bows around these programs that roll 
over and they can generate way more 

1847
01:25:00,851 --> 01:25:03,670
forced than just the amount you're 
pulling back.

1848
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:05,350
So like,
um,

1849
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:09,190
like if you had like an old school Robin
Hood recurve bow,

1850
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:10,600
right,
those bose,

1851
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:11,493
the more you pull them back,
the harder it is because it's like 

1852
01:25:13,930 --> 01:25:14,763
you're,
you're stretching and pulling out would 

1853
01:25:16,301 --> 01:25:18,580
then let it go in the Arrow it takes 
off.

1854
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,160
But with a compound bow there on these 
cams.

1855
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:22,053
So as you pull it back that's happening,
you have these thick carbon fiber or 

1856
01:25:25,271 --> 01:25:26,104
fiberglass limbs that are pulling back 
and holding tremendous amounts of 

1857
01:25:30,221 --> 01:25:30,550
energy.

1858
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:32,650
And then you have these cams that 
rollover,

1859
01:25:32,770 --> 01:25:35,500
that impart and mechanical advantage on 
the whole system.

1860
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:36,633
And then as you pull it back,
the cameras allow it to be light at the 

1861
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:40,833
end.
So if my boat takes 84 pounds to pull 

1862
01:25:42,551 --> 01:25:46,330
back at the end,
it's only like 10 or 20 percent of that.

1863
01:25:46,610 --> 01:25:47,443
Oh Wow.
So I'm holding it with like 20 percent 

1864
01:25:49,001 --> 01:25:49,834
of the amount of energy that it takes to
pull it back so it's not hard to hold 

1865
01:25:51,671 --> 01:25:53,710
onto.
And then when you let the Arrow go,

1866
01:25:54,370 --> 01:25:57,700
it's flying like 290 feet a second.
Holy Cow.

1867
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:00,750
Yeah.
So let's go get raccoons and the ways of

1868
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:01,840
the arrows.
Wait,

1869
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:04,190
what's 500 grams?
How much is 500

1870
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:07,160
grams in a pound?
How many grams in an ounce?

1871
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:11,000
Five hundred grams,
or would that be [inaudible] you say 500

1872
01:26:11,001 --> 01:26:12,350
grams.
It doesn't seem to make sense.

1873
01:26:12,351 --> 01:26:13,910
Like what is.
That doesn't make sense to me.

1874
01:26:13,911 --> 01:26:17,230
I don't know what that is.
That's like a pound and a half pounds.

1875
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:19,610
One point one pounds.
So the arrows a pound.

1876
01:26:19,611 --> 01:26:24,611
So one pound of Arrow is going 290 feet 
second and it's got a razor blade at the

1877
01:26:24,951 --> 01:26:25,784
front of it.
Hopefully razorblades designed to 

1878
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:32,090
penetrate rib bones with a chisel tip to
it.

1879
01:26:32,390 --> 01:26:33,223
Now,
what if you just threw a hammer at the 

1880
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:37,280
raccoon?
You might kill it or you might just hurt

1881
01:26:37,281 --> 01:26:39,740
him.
Then that's probably even worse.

1882
01:26:40,490 --> 01:26:42,920
He wound him and he's walking around 
with a broken leg or something.

1883
01:26:42,921 --> 01:26:43,754
You know,
you got to consider as you're sitting 

1884
01:26:44,601 --> 01:26:48,260
there talking to that raccoon and he's 
like pretending to come up on you.

1885
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:51,360
There's probably two raccoons flanked on
either side.

1886
01:26:52,110 --> 01:26:53,380
The like wolves?
Yeah.

1887
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:57,200
Really you think so?
I bet they feel confident.

1888
01:26:57,620 --> 01:26:59,540
They're crafty.
I was telling him,

1889
01:26:59,541 --> 01:27:00,530
hey man,
fuck off.

1890
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:02,090
And he moved closer to me.
He's like,

1891
01:27:02,091 --> 01:27:04,230
don't you see my boys?
He's just looking at me.

1892
01:27:04,270 --> 01:27:05,810
I mean he's looking right at me and he 
was,

1893
01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:08,930
he was circling like from my side and I 
was like,

1894
01:27:08,931 --> 01:27:10,670
this is crazy.
He's getting closer to me.

1895
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:11,950
Holy Cow.
Yeah.

1896
01:27:11,990 --> 01:27:14,480
Not afraid to.
He wasn't afraid of me at all.

1897
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:15,950
Well,
you know what I mean.

1898
01:27:15,951 --> 01:27:16,784
Look,
I don't wanna I don't want anything bad 

1899
01:27:18,471 --> 01:27:20,450
to happen to the raccoon.
I just don't want him to eat my chicken.

1900
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:21,313
Mine.
We're rolling up the grass and eating 

1901
01:27:24,261 --> 01:27:26,120
bugs underneath.
I come out my grass,

1902
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:28,810
which just being rolled over,
rolled clever,

1903
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:31,910
they have little hands,
they've got a little busy hands,

1904
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:33,883
but if you raped me,
it's such a weird relationship that we 

1905
01:27:35,571 --> 01:27:37,910
have with these things because if you 
raise him from the time their pets,

1906
01:27:38,150 --> 01:27:40,070
apparently they make these amazing pets.

1907
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:40,731
Really?
Yeah.

1908
01:27:40,731 --> 01:27:42,170
If you can catch a raccoon when you're 
really.

1909
01:27:42,171 --> 01:27:44,350
When he's really young and domesticate 
them,

1910
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:45,870
domesticate them.
And you know,

1911
01:27:46,370 --> 01:27:49,190
the problem with animals becomes 
survival.

1912
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:50,533
Survival.
Once food is scarce and once they have 

1913
01:27:52,371 --> 01:27:53,680
to struggle for it,
they,

1914
01:27:53,830 --> 01:27:58,830
they will adopt a wild feral mindset.
Those are dangerous animals.

1915
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:02,120
Their cats or dogs or they're not the 
same.

1916
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:03,433
So our ideas about animals,
like for a lot of people that really 

1917
01:28:05,721 --> 01:28:06,554
truly love animals.
You're talking about these domesticated 

1918
01:28:10,431 --> 01:28:14,960
Weirdo animals that aren't even animal 
like in any way to barely animal.

1919
01:28:14,961 --> 01:28:19,961
Like my friend who worked on a farm was 
like grew up with pigs,

1920
01:28:20,181 --> 01:28:21,320
cows,
the whole thing.

1921
01:28:21,321 --> 01:28:23,820
It was just like she had no sympathy for
them.

1922
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:25,003
It wasn't like we have to be kind to all
these animals because they're big and 

1923
01:28:28,131 --> 01:28:31,850
dumb and smelly and like she just grew 
up with them.

1924
01:28:32,230 --> 01:28:33,410
It was just like.
See,

1925
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:34,910
I feel like that's kind of fucked up 
too.

1926
01:28:34,911 --> 01:28:37,370
Right?
It seems like when you're not related to

1927
01:28:37,371 --> 01:28:38,120
it.
Yeah,

1928
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:38,953
but the reality is that there's just.
There were held pigs just going crazy 

1929
01:28:43,070 --> 01:28:46,310
and we had to survive so we had to pave 
it and put in Jamba juice,

1930
01:28:46,370 --> 01:28:47,203
but I think you need those people that 
are like the crazy diehard animal 

1931
01:28:50,481 --> 01:28:52,130
activist.
Otherwise there would be nothing.

1932
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:54,410
I just want to save the parks.
Just leave.

1933
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:56,510
Just leave Yosemite alone.
Yeah.

1934
01:28:56,511 --> 01:28:57,990
They're going to leave it alone.
Title,

1935
01:28:58,100 --> 01:28:59,900
they're not doing anything to the one 
guy.

1936
01:28:59,901 --> 01:29:01,120
Zinc,
what's his name?

1937
01:29:01,470 --> 01:29:02,130
Yeah,
he spoke.

1938
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:03,540
He seems pretty decent.
Well,

1939
01:29:03,541 --> 01:29:07,710
he's also a big supporter of keeping 
public lands public and not selling them

1940
01:29:07,711 --> 01:29:09,150
to the states.
Oh really?

1941
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:10,530
Yeah.
The way it works,

1942
01:29:11,030 --> 01:29:14,640
it's been explained to me by Steve 
Rinella and some other people,

1943
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:15,533
but the way it works is that we have all
this land that's a federal land and you 

1944
01:29:18,661 --> 01:29:21,450
can go on it.
You would hunt fish,

1945
01:29:21,451 --> 01:29:22,590
you could camp,
you could go.

1946
01:29:22,591 --> 01:29:27,390
It's literally our land,
but if you sell it to the state,

1947
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:28,853
if the state has a financial burden,
they'll sell it off to private 

1948
01:29:31,321 --> 01:29:33,090
corporations,
so that's the danger.

1949
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:36,120
The danger is the state will come upon 
dire times,

1950
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:39,270
it will be forced to sell it off,
but the federal government,

1951
01:29:39,650 --> 01:29:40,483
they can't do that,
so as long as people don't vote to make 

1952
01:29:42,541 --> 01:29:44,520
it the property of the state,
you're okay.

1953
01:29:44,521 --> 01:29:45,960
It stays in the federal trust.

1954
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:46,793
If it's in the federal trust guy,
manage the way it's been managed since 

1955
01:29:49,051 --> 01:29:51,810
Teddy Roosevelt was around,
so we figured out a way to do it.

1956
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:52,913
Where as of right now they get leasing 
rights for minerals and for cattle and 

1957
01:29:58,321 --> 01:29:59,154
stuff like that.
The bundy ranch thing was about those 

1958
01:30:00,871 --> 01:30:01,810
guys.
I've been Oregon,

1959
01:30:01,811 --> 01:30:02,644
Oregon.
Yeah,

1960
01:30:02,910 --> 01:30:03,743
but the.
But what Pruitt is his big push is to 

1961
01:30:05,911 --> 01:30:06,744
make things give all the power back to 
the states and that's a gateway that 

1962
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:13,090
gateway to privatization of and that's 
A.

1963
01:30:13,091 --> 01:30:15,630
There's a hotly contested bill that was 
in the house,

1964
01:30:15,631 --> 01:30:16,464
hr six slash 21 by this Guy Jason 
Chaffetz and if you want to hear him 

1965
01:30:21,510 --> 01:30:26,460
talking to my friend Cameron Hanes on 
Cameron's a most recent podcast,

1966
01:30:26,461 --> 01:30:31,461
he flew to dc to talk to him.
The guy with drew her six slash 21,

1967
01:30:32,011 --> 01:30:35,940
which is turning over 3 million acres of
land to the state,

1968
01:30:36,210 --> 01:30:39,930
which state could then do with whatever 
they want and the problem with that is a

1969
01:30:39,950 --> 01:30:43,890
slippery slope and it eventually leads 
to privatization of a lot of those lands

1970
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,980
and especially the people were scared of
that with Republicans in power,

1971
01:30:46,981 --> 01:30:47,814
especially when you see that they lessen
the EPA and all the different things 

1972
01:30:50,711 --> 01:30:51,080
they're doing.

1973
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:53,160
Like you were just talking about the 
environmental satellites,

1974
01:30:53,161 --> 01:30:54,570
all that stuff scares the shit out of 
people.

1975
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:58,470
So then the next one would,
he's got her 6:22,

1976
01:30:58,471 --> 01:30:59,304
which people are also opposed to because
it would be about turning over the 

1977
01:31:05,070 --> 01:31:09,300
policing of those lands and uh,
the law enforcement,

1978
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,273
turning it over to state and taking out 
a federal hands bureau of land 

1979
01:31:12,631 --> 01:31:16,230
management and stuff like that part for 
Park Rangers.

1980
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:19,590
They wanted to do two local sheriffs 
but,

1981
01:31:19,591 --> 01:31:22,110
and then they would allocate money 
specifically for that,

1982
01:31:22,111 --> 01:31:24,810
but people think that's a slippery slope
too because they don't know what they're

1983
01:31:24,811 --> 01:31:26,880
doing and except it sets it up for,
hey,

1984
01:31:26,881 --> 01:31:28,230
these people don't know what they're 
doing,

1985
01:31:28,231 --> 01:31:30,360
we need to go back and uh,
you know,

1986
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:31,223
sell this land because if we do that 
then we won't be responsible for 

1987
01:31:33,361 --> 01:31:36,770
maintaining it.
And then real private group in this is,

1988
01:31:36,990 --> 01:31:38,940
this is what Rinella believes is going 
on.

1989
01:31:38,941 --> 01:31:40,910
And the Guy Jason Chaffetz a,
uh,

1990
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:43,200
he disagreed and he has his points of 
view,

1991
01:31:43,201 --> 01:31:44,400
which I don't know if he's right or 
wrong,

1992
01:31:44,910 --> 01:31:47,090
just leave them alone.
Just just,

1993
01:31:47,370 --> 01:31:48,870
just the parks.
Just that.

1994
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:51,240
Can you just leave that alone?
Well,

1995
01:31:51,241 --> 01:31:53,040
it's a super rare thing we have and it's
really cool.

1996
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:54,173
It's amazing.
It literally changed my life when I 

1997
01:31:56,161 --> 01:32:00,040
started in college,
going back country with my buddies.

1998
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:00,933
We would just get packs.
We didn't know what we're doing in the 

1999
01:32:02,591 --> 01:32:03,424
beginning we did.
We literally were carrying gear like in 

2000
01:32:05,981 --> 01:32:06,814
like army sacks and it was just go into 
the back of Yosemite for a week and a 

2001
01:32:10,870 --> 01:32:11,703
half and Denver in Montana and Wyoming 
and those were life changing 

2002
01:32:17,950 --> 01:32:18,783
experiences.
Just to sit behind the grand tetons in 

2003
01:32:21,131 --> 01:32:23,410
this land.
It does something to you,

2004
01:32:23,411 --> 01:32:24,244
it changes you and to think that you're 
gonna sit there and there's going to be 

2005
01:32:26,261 --> 01:32:31,261
a back hoe digging something up to look 
for some oil that might be under sulfur.

2006
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,473
Well,
you know that when those oil things are 

2007
01:32:35,251 --> 01:32:40,251
going to weird sounds,

2008
01:32:41,380 --> 01:32:43,390
it's a nightmare.
Sound like,

2009
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:45,100
whoa.
It's a nightmare.

2010
01:32:45,630 --> 01:32:48,010
He had just leave that alone,
but it's,

2011
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:51,970
it's so crazy that we operate on the 
blood of the earth.

2012
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:54,430
Yeah,
and that's really what oil is.

2013
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:55,293
Oil is like the blood of the earth,
the word like these giant mosquitoes 

2014
01:32:57,881 --> 01:32:58,714
that are using machines to suck the 
blood out of the earth and then what we 

2015
01:33:02,051 --> 01:33:02,884
do with that blood,
we take it and we pollute the air with 

2016
01:33:05,651 --> 01:33:06,580
it.
That's what we do.

2017
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:07,414
We burn it,
we light it on fire and we have these 

2018
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:14,100
engines that are essentially controlled 
explosions contained in steel and inside

2019
01:33:14,771 --> 01:33:15,604
the of this.
This blood that's boiling and burning 

2020
01:33:19,181 --> 01:33:22,450
and fire and explosions are going off 
inside the steel box.

2021
01:33:22,451 --> 01:33:24,780
There's iron box and then we're driving 
around,

2022
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:29,510
spitting out our poison gas.
The worst thing.

2023
01:33:29,650 --> 01:33:32,260
Yeah,
totally weird thing and we don't need it

2024
01:33:32,261 --> 01:33:33,250
anymore.
Well,

2025
01:33:33,251 --> 01:33:36,280
when you go buy a factory like a New 
Jersey factory and you see those fucking

2026
01:33:36,281 --> 01:33:40,540
plumes of smoke blown up theory,
how are you allowed to do that?

2027
01:33:40,570 --> 01:33:42,030
Yeah.
How are you allowed to do that?

2028
01:33:42,070 --> 01:33:44,630
Would you be allowed to blow that right 
on a baby's betty?

2029
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:47,950
I was driving down the New Jersey 
turnpike in college.

2030
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:50,620
I was working for like a fireplace 
company.

2031
01:33:50,621 --> 01:33:53,440
We're on the turnpike in the summer,
like August.

2032
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:56,410
No air conditioning in the truck sitting
there.

2033
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:01,420
The whole area air was orange.
It was

2034
01:34:01,550 --> 01:34:03,840
orange.
Just coming out of those smokes.

2035
01:34:03,870 --> 01:34:05,810
I was like,
if I ever get cancer,

2036
01:34:06,110 --> 01:34:10,160
this is the day.
This is the day it happened.

2037
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:11,053
Oh,
I remember these places you would go by 

2038
01:34:12,261 --> 01:34:15,230
where it just stunk.
Here's the thing.

2039
01:34:15,231 --> 01:34:17,780
My parents,
and this is not just factories,

2040
01:34:17,781 --> 01:34:18,614
it's also farms.
They say like one of the biggest 

2041
01:34:20,391 --> 01:34:23,710
producers of methane pollution and the 
country is the,

2042
01:34:24,020 --> 01:34:26,840
the cattle industry.
And when I used to,

2043
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:29,550
my parents used to live in Pennsylvania.
They used to live.

2044
01:34:30,830 --> 01:34:33,100
Where the fuck were they?
Outside of Wilksberry?

2045
01:34:33,260 --> 01:34:36,350
I forget the name of the town.
It was in nowhere.

2046
01:34:36,351 --> 01:34:37,161
Pennsylvania.
Right.

2047
01:34:37,161 --> 01:34:39,730
So you have to drive through what,
when you think of Pennsylvania,

2048
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:40,573
think of Philadelphia or Pittsburgh,
but there's a lot between where you're 

2049
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:45,500
just going 30 miles an hour.
So you know,

2050
01:34:45,530 --> 01:34:46,363
slam into a deer.
Some method of deers darden onto the 

2051
01:34:49,281 --> 01:34:51,910
highway and like what in the fuck kind 
of places this,

2052
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:53,053
it might be.
My parents had deer in the yard every 

2053
01:34:54,370 --> 01:34:56,450
day.
They hated deer.

2054
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,040
Deer like roses and like

2055
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:00,560
get those county fucking animals.
Yeah.

2056
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:02,750
And um,
anyway,

2057
01:35:02,751 --> 01:35:04,160
uh,
when you would drive down there,

2058
01:35:04,161 --> 01:35:04,994
you would go past these farms and the 
smell was so bad you could not believe 

2059
01:35:10,970 --> 01:35:13,460
that people could live there.
The smell,

2060
01:35:13,461 --> 01:35:15,290
because it was in the summer when I was 
visiting them.

2061
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:17,300
It would smell like shit all the time 
I'm sure.

2062
01:35:17,301 --> 01:35:18,940
But it was hot too.
Yeah.

2063
01:35:19,010 --> 01:35:21,380
So it was hot,
funky shit smell.

2064
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:22,393
And it was everywhere.
It was just the air you are breathing 

2065
01:35:24,741 --> 01:35:27,350
was shit.
Particle air 100 percent.

2066
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:31,490
I drove past a,
the Hormel factory in the summer ones.

2067
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:33,200
Oh my God.
First of all,

2068
01:35:33,201 --> 01:35:34,034
there's a whole bunch of pigs and stuff.
You're behind these trucks on the way 

2069
01:35:36,621 --> 01:35:38,240
there.
And then it was like,

2070
01:35:38,241 --> 01:35:39,074
where are they going?
And then you just see in the next giant 

2071
01:35:41,271 --> 01:35:45,620
Hormel plant,
the smell in the summertime.

2072
01:35:45,650 --> 01:35:48,890
All.
But we have so many faces to feed.

2073
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:51,200
Yeah,
there are so many mouths.

2074
01:35:51,230 --> 01:35:54,830
There's so many beings walking around 
right now getting hungry.

2075
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:56,293
Right?
They're all getting hungry and they've 

2076
01:35:58,221 --> 01:36:00,020
all got to be fed.
So it's like,

2077
01:36:00,021 --> 01:36:02,900
what's the,
what's the solution to a good question.

2078
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:03,883
They're all hungry,
they're going to get hungry and another 

2079
01:36:05,301 --> 01:36:08,510
three hours going to crap it out,
and then they're going to eat again.

2080
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:09,793
We are the zombies,
the zombies running around needing to 

2081
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:15,380
feed constantly and if you want to be 
able to pull into that Wendy's,

2082
01:36:15,381 --> 01:36:19,730
drive through and get that double 
cheeseburger at 1:00

2083
01:36:19,731 --> 01:36:21,500
in the morning,
someone's got to pay.

2084
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:24,770
I mean you can go to the Wendy's drive 
through at 1:00

2085
01:36:24,770 --> 01:36:28,340
AM and almost instantly get a 
cheeseburger beef right away.

2086
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:29,960
Yeah,
ground animal sandwich.

2087
01:36:29,990 --> 01:36:32,060
You don't have to feed in,
have to shoot him.

2088
01:36:32,270 --> 01:36:33,830
You don't have to cut it up,
you have to grind it,

2089
01:36:33,831 --> 01:36:35,990
you don't have to cook it,
you don't have to find a button right in

2090
01:36:35,991 --> 01:36:37,220
your face,
right in your face.

2091
01:36:37,220 --> 01:36:39,290
And it cost like what?
Four bucks or something.

2092
01:36:39,291 --> 01:36:41,000
It's nothing.
And then boom,

2093
01:36:41,001 --> 01:36:43,340
you're full and then you're on your 
merry way.

2094
01:36:44,220 --> 01:36:49,220
So weird and it's millions.
Billions of people are doing that belief

2095
01:36:49,610 --> 01:36:51,110
and that's the only way you can have a 
city.

2096
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:53,420
You can't have a city where everybody's 
growing things.

2097
01:36:53,421 --> 01:36:54,780
None of food.
No Way.

2098
01:36:54,810 --> 01:36:58,010
How could you feel like if if people 
were eating meat in particular candidate

2099
01:36:58,460 --> 01:36:59,293
vegetables,
could you imagine if New York City had 

2100
01:37:00,681 --> 01:37:01,850
to be self sustaining?
Oh,

2101
01:37:01,851 --> 01:37:03,670
please.
I was looking just for a,

2102
01:37:03,671 --> 01:37:07,070
a,
a farm to table steakhouse in New York.

2103
01:37:07,310 --> 01:37:08,520
They don't have,
they don't have that.

2104
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:09,413
Nobody can provide the grass fed beef to
one rest in one New York restaurant is 

2105
01:37:14,451 --> 01:37:16,940
going to go through so much meat in one 
night.

2106
01:37:17,130 --> 01:37:21,350
You can't do it.
God Damn just one restaurant when you go

2107
01:37:21,351 --> 01:37:22,184
there.
Like I only go there once or twice a 

2108
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:24,650
year,
but every time I go there and go,

2109
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:26,780
oh yeah,
I forgot.

2110
01:37:26,781 --> 01:37:28,460
Oh crazy.
This place is like,

2111
01:37:28,461 --> 01:37:32,090
this doesn't make any sense.
I was looking at the map yesterday.

2112
01:37:32,270 --> 01:37:33,103
It was looking at um,
lyme disease centers as lyme disease is 

2113
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:39,290
God damn scary.
And there's a lyme disease map.

2114
01:37:39,710 --> 01:37:40,543
And the lyme disease map is fascinating 
because it's like a giant percentage of 

2115
01:37:43,701 --> 01:37:45,620
it is like Massachusetts,
New York,

2116
01:37:45,621 --> 01:37:46,610
the east coast,
east coast,

2117
01:37:46,611 --> 01:37:50,930
just overwhelmed with wellmed.
I know so many people that got it.

2118
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:53,540
Another thing was weird.
It's like shape of New York.

2119
01:37:53,980 --> 01:37:56,020
I was looking at it.
How is on

2120
01:37:56,090 --> 01:37:56,923
that up there?
New York and long island is this thing 

2121
01:38:01,050 --> 01:38:01,571
like,
well,

2122
01:38:01,571 --> 01:38:03,270
how come you guys don't have more than 
one state?

2123
01:38:03,660 --> 01:38:05,580
This is a bunch of different states.
You gotta yeah.

2124
01:38:05,581 --> 01:38:06,414
You put a lot of stuff together.
Like New York State is definitely not 

2125
01:38:09,481 --> 01:38:10,550
New York.
Yeah.

2126
01:38:10,710 --> 01:38:12,330
New York state might as well be 
Kentucky.

2127
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:13,980
Absolutely.
Might as well.

2128
01:38:14,010 --> 01:38:15,960
Totally different.
It's like going in Alabama.

2129
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:19,320
There's some spots like when you drive 
into buffalo or something like that.

2130
01:38:19,321 --> 01:38:19,951
We like,
okay,

2131
01:38:19,951 --> 01:38:21,380
where the fuck am I?
Right.

2132
01:38:21,990 --> 01:38:24,080
Like Buffalo,
good luck.

2133
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:27,840
You might as well be in West Virginia as
wellbeing.

2134
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:29,520
Rural,
North Carolina.

2135
01:38:30,620 --> 01:38:31,453
Oh,
mile away from how people are in the 

2136
01:38:33,961 --> 01:38:36,270
West village.
There's like you have your cities,

2137
01:38:36,271 --> 01:38:38,050
you know you have Albany,
Buffalo,

2138
01:38:38,051 --> 01:38:40,090
you have syracuse,
but you don't.

2139
01:38:40,170 --> 01:38:42,240
Those are so different.
Do you live in New York?

2140
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:46,440
I lived in new Rochelle in new Rochelle,
like right outside the city.

2141
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:49,020
It's like I know where it is.
Or the bronx rather.

2142
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:52,050
Yeah.
I lived in New York for a long time.

2143
01:38:52,530 --> 01:38:53,363
It's um,
it's just a weird shape that it's all 

2144
01:38:56,011 --> 01:38:56,844
that stuff up there as New York to Long 
Island and Manhattan and Brooklyn and 

2145
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:04,560
New York state.
When I was a kid,

2146
01:39:04,610 --> 01:39:06,630
uh,
when I was coming up as a standup,

2147
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:07,553
I would uh,
like the first Gig I ever got in New 

2148
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:12,030
York.
I was so nervous.

2149
01:39:12,510 --> 01:39:13,343
I couldn't believe I was doing a show in
New York and it was a New York state 

2150
01:39:16,801 --> 01:39:17,634
room so I had to drive up through 
western Massachusetts to get into New 

2151
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:22,890
York.
But I was like so proud of myself that I

2152
01:39:22,891 --> 01:39:25,380
did a show in New York.
Not even the city,

2153
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:27,090
not even close just,
but it was like,

2154
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:29,970
it made me feel like,
okay,

2155
01:39:30,180 --> 01:39:33,510
I can do comedy in New York.
Look at that big deal,

2156
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:34,020
look at that.

2157
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:35,400
Crazy.
So white plains,

2158
01:39:35,401 --> 01:39:37,050
he see that in the lower right hand 
corner.

2159
01:39:37,530 --> 01:39:38,363
That's where I used to live.
Right outside of that because I used to 

2160
01:39:40,381 --> 01:39:41,214
play pool in white plains.
I'd executive billiards if you go like 

2161
01:39:43,780 --> 01:39:47,130
see where the Y is in New Jersey on 
yonkers.

2162
01:39:47,131 --> 01:39:49,080
Yeah,
that why right there,

2163
01:39:49,081 --> 01:39:51,240
that's about,
that's about where I grew up.

2164
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:52,530
Dude.
Look at that.

2165
01:39:52,531 --> 01:39:56,400
Fucking look at the size of that thing.
It's a beautiful state.

2166
01:39:56,670 --> 01:39:57,503
The adirondacks.
You ever gone through the adirondacks 

2167
01:39:58,741 --> 01:40:00,950
goes all the way through to the top of 
Vermont?

2168
01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:03,060
Yeah.
Well it's New York.

2169
01:40:03,061 --> 01:40:05,340
What do you want?
But isn't that insane?

2170
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:07,020
Like what?
An enormous,

2171
01:40:07,021 --> 01:40:08,640
enormous state.
Yeah,

2172
01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:10,530
it takes Vermont,
Massachusetts,

2173
01:40:10,590 --> 01:40:12,360
Connecticut.
Wow.

2174
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:16,380
Look at the catskill mountains were 
custom motto used to train Mike Tyson.

2175
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:18,630
That's right.
And there's Ithaca.

2176
01:40:19,570 --> 01:40:21,840
There's roam a Rome,
New York.

2177
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:24,030
Because where it worked,
that's where I worked.

2178
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:25,680
I worked in UTICA.
In utica.

2179
01:40:25,730 --> 01:40:26,640
Yep.
What'd you do there?

2180
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:27,533
I did stand up there and I had to drive 
from Massachusetts that Massachusetts 

2181
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:32,633
Ninety,
I think them 90 was the Massachusetts 

2182
01:40:35,401 --> 01:40:37,560
turnpike and then it turned into New 
York state.

2183
01:40:38,110 --> 01:40:39,120
Yeah.
Look at the,

2184
01:40:39,121 --> 01:40:41,880
uh,
I've done gigs in Rochester,

2185
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:45,930
Buffalo,
Saratoga Springs.

2186
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:47,520
There's a new club there.
I hear,

2187
01:40:47,850 --> 01:40:50,730
you know what I used to hear all the 
time when I was a kid to the Capsi.

2188
01:40:50,890 --> 01:40:52,440
No,
I'm not the catskills,

2189
01:40:52,470 --> 01:40:54,760
but what was one that's in Pennsylvania?

2190
01:40:55,150 --> 01:40:57,520
The poconos.
Poconos.

2191
01:40:57,521 --> 01:40:58,900
The mount airy lodge.
Yeah.

2192
01:40:58,901 --> 01:40:59,734
You always heard about people going to 
the poison that were dirty dancing took 

2193
01:41:01,571 --> 01:41:02,404
place?
No,

2194
01:41:02,410 --> 01:41:03,243
that was cat skills.
Poconos is like the champagne tub for 

2195
01:41:09,071 --> 01:41:12,380
the mount airy lodge.
They had that ad on TV and the catskills

2196
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,590
was like where the comics would go.
Yeah.

2197
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:17,660
Yeah.
That's where like those Roman type do.

2198
01:41:17,661 --> 01:41:18,970
That's right.
Wow.

2199
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:20,630
Yeah.
She'll manage.

2200
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:22,720
If you can go back in time and watch 
some of that.

2201
01:41:23,430 --> 01:41:27,280
They used to play Buddy Hackett hotels,
little bungalows,

2202
01:41:27,281 --> 01:41:28,114
little trailer home like it was.
Everybody from New York dumped up there 

2203
01:41:32,141 --> 01:41:32,974
for the weekends and then the 
entertainers would come and they would 

2204
01:41:35,291 --> 01:41:36,124
just.
You do it was like Manhattan to do a 

2205
01:41:37,871 --> 01:41:40,080
whole bunch of gigs a night.
That is the Poconos.

2206
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:40,933
This is an Arrow through a heart.
Also the mount airy lodge couples 

2207
01:41:43,901 --> 01:41:46,780
resorts.
All couples resorts in the catskills.

2208
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:50,480
Poconos,
Poconos.

2209
01:41:50,530 --> 01:41:52,360
A sexy.
That's where you go.

2210
01:41:52,361 --> 01:41:52,691
Well,
yeah.

2211
01:41:52,691 --> 01:41:54,620
That one hit that one up.
Yeah,

2212
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,700
that was in the ad.
That was in the ad when I was a kid.

2213
01:41:57,701 --> 01:42:02,510
We didn't for a kiss.
He's got a girl floating in a pool.

2214
01:42:02,511 --> 01:42:03,460
You that.
Oh,

2215
01:42:03,461 --> 01:42:04,294
heart-shaped baths.
I with one of those weird roof's 

2216
01:42:06,180 --> 01:42:07,870
destroyed.
You pretend like you're fucking.

2217
01:42:07,871 --> 01:42:09,190
Oh,
it's all destroyed.

2218
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:12,580
The abandoned Poconos.
There was so much banging their.

2219
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:15,280
Yeah.
That's the champagne one.

2220
01:42:15,490 --> 01:42:19,240
Look,
it's a champagne glass and you make love

2221
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:20,800
to you lady.
How do you get in there?

2222
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:21,634
You got to take an elevator.
You get them having sex with each other 

2223
01:42:28,580 --> 01:42:31,900
to get the champagne glass.
Let's go through.

2224
01:42:31,901 --> 01:42:34,720
The broker knows and we'll go to Egypt 
room.

2225
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:35,700
Oh,
you serious?

2226
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:41,500
Can you really get the Egypt?
There's a waiting list,

2227
01:42:41,501 --> 01:42:46,300
but I know a guy.
She's got her shoes off to take her from

2228
01:42:46,301 --> 01:42:48,310
behind.
He sneaking up behind her.

2229
01:42:48,670 --> 01:42:52,220
I got you a new coat from Lord and 
Taylor and that's a.

2230
01:42:52,221 --> 01:42:53,054
that's a fuck position.
You only going to stay like that with 

2231
01:42:55,001 --> 01:42:56,410
someone you're banging.
See?

2232
01:42:56,580 --> 01:42:59,630
Because if you were a that was a buddy 
of yours and you were sitting in his lap

2233
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:01,080
like that.
People walked in,

2234
01:43:01,100 --> 01:43:01,690
they'd be like,
Hey,

2235
01:43:01,690 --> 01:43:03,670
what the fuck's going on?
We're just watching the game.

2236
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:07,000
It's just how we caught her.
Stay warm and preserved body.

2237
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:09,040
Why your feet off a while you have your 
shoes off.

2238
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:10,413
My bare feet on.
Are you going to climb me up to that 

2239
01:43:12,191 --> 01:43:15,040
glass or just look at it?
You have to throw her up there.

2240
01:43:15,041 --> 01:43:18,050
If you want to bang her way.

2241
01:43:18,070 --> 01:43:23,070
She lets you mount airy law.
You gotta thrower over your arm,

2242
01:43:23,220 --> 01:43:27,070
like throw over your shoulder and then 
you have to climb stuff gently.

2243
01:43:27,071 --> 01:43:30,310
Layer down champaign.
Oh,

2244
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:31,233
it's so terrible that there's another,
a couple of different couples in the 

2245
01:43:33,361 --> 01:43:33,980
Egypt,
Rome.

2246
01:43:33,980 --> 01:43:34,813
So I'll let you know.
You are not the first people to fuck in 

2247
01:43:36,071 --> 01:43:37,000
this room.
This,

2248
01:43:37,090 --> 01:43:39,540
this African American couples been 
fucking in this room before you.

2249
01:43:39,550 --> 01:43:40,300
Oh yeah,
that's what.

2250
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:42,940
What do you think happens there?
What do you think happens there?

2251
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:45,260
That's where people go to get there.
Fuck off.

2252
01:43:46,810 --> 01:43:51,620
Fucking basically naked pants on.
That's like playgirl 1975.

2253
01:43:51,810 --> 01:43:52,390
Gave

2254
01:43:52,390 --> 01:43:56,030
Handy and he said thanks.
And she just is really sensitive because

2255
01:43:56,031 --> 01:43:57,950
she's on her period and they got some 
room service.

2256
01:43:58,010 --> 01:43:58,843
Look at this.
This guy's hanging from the edge that's 

2257
01:44:00,411 --> 01:44:02,510
going to break.
It's going to be like when I'm rob,

2258
01:44:02,511 --> 01:44:05,990
dry deck videos with a champagne glass 
going to come down,

2259
01:44:06,250 --> 01:44:08,390
crushed his skull.
She's going to fall.

2260
01:44:08,391 --> 01:44:09,950
She's going to be paralyzed from the 
neck down.

2261
01:44:09,951 --> 01:44:10,784
He's going to be dead and it'll all be 
on security camera that the Russians 

2262
01:44:13,971 --> 01:44:14,804
have captured through wikileaks.
There's no part of looking at the two 

2263
01:44:17,031 --> 01:44:17,864
people in the champagne glass.
That makes you think that would be a 

2264
01:44:20,961 --> 01:44:24,050
good idea.
How about this old guy to get my fuck on

2265
01:44:24,051 --> 01:44:24,884
down here.

2266
01:44:26,850 --> 01:44:28,520
Who needs a lady?
I'm by myself.

2267
01:44:28,521 --> 01:44:30,620
I'm in the glass.
I had to make a decision.

2268
01:44:30,621 --> 01:44:31,454
I can only follow one pair of glasses.
So I went with the prescription 

2269
01:44:33,261 --> 01:44:34,670
sunglasses.
I don't give a fuck.

2270
01:44:35,030 --> 01:44:35,863
I don't like to look at it.
The daytime to those some fluorescent 

2271
01:44:39,141 --> 01:44:40,790
lights at bad for your brain.
Louis,

2272
01:44:40,890 --> 01:44:43,660
trust me that bad for your brain.
My guy's a good guy.

2273
01:44:44,330 --> 01:44:45,163
Nobody knew what was good for you,
buddy did it really did to go to school 

2274
01:44:48,231 --> 01:44:50,150
to find out whether or not you should 
eat cigarettes.

2275
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:55,910
A toast to pride.
Gay dudes getting that bathtub.

2276
01:44:55,940 --> 01:44:58,610
Gay dudes have been banging.
Everyone bangs in that glass smell.

2277
01:44:58,611 --> 01:45:02,130
Bleach bleach.
Looking at her puts.

2278
01:45:02,210 --> 01:45:03,043
Why you have clothes on hooker?
I'm by myself in a full full one bottle 

2279
01:45:05,970 --> 01:45:10,970
babies.
It's like more like a so depressing.

2280
01:45:11,211 --> 01:45:12,540
People are so bored.

2281
01:45:14,980 --> 01:45:15,813
Oh God.
Can't you stay home and read a book or 

2282
01:45:20,001 --> 01:45:20,834
just take a nap.
Do you get your daughter was taking 

2283
01:45:22,911 --> 01:45:23,744
dancing lessons for Patrick swayze.
He's got that fucking Silky mullet and 

2284
01:45:27,081 --> 01:45:27,914
he's dancing and moving across the floor
and you know guy does that unless he 

2285
01:45:30,141 --> 01:45:30,974
wants to.
Fuck.

2286
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:32,840
Fucking guys are.
He's fucking your daughter.

2287
01:45:33,470 --> 01:45:37,400
That's why dance is so good.
Hips around wants to let you know.

2288
01:45:37,401 --> 01:45:41,830
This is how it fuck you.
Fuck you to the spinning around.

2289
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:46,840
Also style type polyester pants.
Do you remember Saturday night fever?

2290
01:45:48,141 --> 01:45:50,330
You remember when it came out where 
everybody wanted to go dancing?

2291
01:45:50,390 --> 01:45:52,160
Yeah,
I was a little kid,

2292
01:45:52,161 --> 01:45:57,161
but I remember all of a sudden everyone 
was dressing like them.

2293
01:45:58,340 --> 01:45:59,780
What year did Saturday night fever?
[inaudible]?

2294
01:45:59,781 --> 01:46:01,160
Seventy seven.
Was it?

2295
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:02,653
Yeah,
so it was 10 years ago and I remember 

2296
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:08,300
people just would go dancing all the 
time.

2297
01:46:08,630 --> 01:46:09,463
It's true.
And they were wearing like old open 

2298
01:46:11,571 --> 01:46:12,404
shirts.
My aunts were living with us at the 

2299
01:46:13,341 --> 01:46:16,160
time.
I moved from New Jersey or Florida where

2300
01:46:16,161 --> 01:46:18,020
the fuck they were at the time.
I think they,

2301
01:46:18,021 --> 01:46:18,810
uh,
they,

2302
01:46:18,810 --> 01:46:19,643
they move with us around that same time.
When I was 10 I went dancing where they 

2303
01:46:23,391 --> 01:46:25,010
finance.
Yeah,

2304
01:46:25,011 --> 01:46:27,110
they were nice looking at this.
Here it is,

2305
01:46:27,111 --> 01:46:29,120
yeah.
Oh Jesus.

2306
01:46:29,660 --> 01:46:31,100
Oh Yeah,
look at that shirt.

2307
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:33,710
Open shirt hair because it never had 
hair like that.

2308
01:46:33,740 --> 01:46:36,530
What a great album.
It's amazing.

2309
01:46:36,531 --> 01:46:38,570
The bgs,
the beaches were incredible.

2310
01:46:38,571 --> 01:46:39,331
Credible.
We should,

2311
01:46:39,331 --> 01:46:42,310
we could play some of it on the podcast 
who can sing like that.

2312
01:46:42,850 --> 01:46:45,710
You had to cigarettes on cigarette 
smoking.

2313
01:46:45,711 --> 01:46:46,544
They were playing records and it was all
about going out and everybody would go 

2314
01:46:49,891 --> 01:46:50,400
dancing

2315
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:55,400
and occasionally knife fights and that 
girl accidentally got their product in.

2316
01:46:56,430 --> 01:46:57,263
She was cute,
but she wasn't as hot as the other girl 

2317
01:46:58,810 --> 01:47:00,750
when she dropped the condoms and it was 
like,

2318
01:47:00,751 --> 01:47:02,400
what were those?
Yeah,

2319
01:47:02,460 --> 01:47:04,530
I didn't know what happened and he's 
looking at A.

2320
01:47:04,710 --> 01:47:07,380
I can't believe how good she is.
You want to give me lessons.

2321
01:47:08,790 --> 01:47:11,670
Next thing you know,
they're bang and she's not from his side

2322
01:47:11,671 --> 01:47:14,790
of the tracks.
She shouldn't be with them and you know,

2323
01:47:14,791 --> 01:47:15,624
he's kind of flawed,
but he's got this special something and 

2324
01:47:18,781 --> 01:47:21,690
he could dance.
He could really dance.

2325
01:47:21,691 --> 01:47:22,910
Tony,
you can really.

2326
01:47:22,970 --> 01:47:24,270
You think so?
Yeah.

2327
01:47:24,271 --> 01:47:28,950
You could really dance time.
They just wanted to dance.

2328
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:31,560
No one does that anymore.
I don't know,

2329
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:34,920
just hadn't love songs.
There were so many love songs.

2330
01:47:34,990 --> 01:47:37,410
The Seventies.
Just life in general was different.

2331
01:47:37,411 --> 01:47:39,990
Yeah.
Came out of the Vietnam War and stuff.

2332
01:47:39,990 --> 01:47:42,510
He just want it to just chill out and 
love a little bit.

2333
01:47:42,810 --> 01:47:46,590
Whereas we're getting overwhelmed with 
data and information.

2334
01:47:46,591 --> 01:47:47,424
This becomes more and more ridiculous.
You look at like making a movie exactly 

2335
01:47:50,041 --> 01:47:54,360
like this today and you could make one 
of those like step on up dance movies,

2336
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:57,800
but those movies are stupid.
La La land,

2337
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:58,673
but I don't know what that is.
That's the one that almost won the 

2338
01:48:00,841 --> 01:48:01,674
award.
It was a big hit this year and it was a 

2339
01:48:04,380 --> 01:48:07,110
musical and there's a lot of dancing.
Well,

2340
01:48:07,410 --> 01:48:08,940
did you see it?
I did.

2341
01:48:09,270 --> 01:48:14,270
How dare you live with girls?
The theater queens.

2342
01:48:14,370 --> 01:48:16,590
We weren't in the theater.
We were watching it at home.

2343
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:19,680
I've got the screener and my kids wanted
to see it.

2344
01:48:19,681 --> 01:48:21,720
I didn't really enjoy it.
Will you listen?

2345
01:48:21,750 --> 01:48:22,583
It's an anomaly.
I was fighting a raccoon and while they 

2346
01:48:25,550 --> 01:48:28,110
were watching it I was fighting a 
raccoon in the face.

2347
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:31,230
Oh Wow.
That's a rough night.

2348
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:35,010
But it was this,
but it was kind of this.

2349
01:48:35,011 --> 01:48:37,980
It was kind of dancing and la,
la,

2350
01:48:37,981 --> 01:48:38,814
la.
What I'm saying is this is a dumb movie 

2351
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:43,950
and if you want to make this dumb,
Louis today wouldn't be so interesting.

2352
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:45,510
It will be silly.
You'd be like,

2353
01:48:45,511 --> 01:48:46,344
this is so silly,
but now the people we know more about 

2354
01:48:50,281 --> 01:48:52,380
how people are,
you know,

2355
01:48:52,390 --> 01:48:57,390
it's just different and we've seen a lot
of stuff so things can't be so a shitty.

2356
01:48:58,010 --> 01:48:59,610
Yeah.
I was watching everything.

2357
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:02,610
I saw someone had a thing for a speed 
buggy.

2358
01:49:02,680 --> 01:49:05,370
Remember that cartoon speed buggy?
No,

2359
01:49:05,371 --> 01:49:06,460
I don't.
It was like a.

2360
01:49:06,660 --> 01:49:10,820
It was like a cartoon when we were in 
the buggy speed button,

2361
01:49:10,830 --> 01:49:11,700
remember?
Yeah,

2362
01:49:11,701 --> 01:49:15,280
and it had the guy with the goggles and 
they would do this little theme song and

2363
01:49:15,350 --> 01:49:19,770
who would go speed buggy,
look at this and they'd go speed buggy,

2364
01:49:20,100 --> 01:49:22,620
and then speed buggy goes,
that's me.

2365
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:23,873
Wait a minute.
Does that have anything to do with 

2366
01:49:24,361 --> 01:49:27,630
scooby doo or they just thieves.
Probably the same people.

2367
01:49:27,670 --> 01:49:30,200
Exactly like the Scooby Doo people.
Yeah.

2368
01:49:30,230 --> 01:49:34,110
That's that Scooby Doo.
Instead of the car is Scooby Doo.

2369
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:37,860
Shaggy,
redheaded guy and those.

2370
01:49:37,900 --> 01:49:38,733
That's the other two people that really 
hanging out with scooby Doo and the 

2371
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:43,800
cheerleader.
We're in the same clothes.

2372
01:49:44,310 --> 01:49:44,721
Yeah.
Look,

2373
01:49:44,721 --> 01:49:48,130
that's a fight crimes and they find out 
who the bad guys are.

2374
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:50,260
Oh,
the gorilla almost gets it.

2375
01:49:50,290 --> 01:49:51,123
Like see that guy in the back?
That's the jock and the girl in the 

2376
01:49:52,781 --> 01:49:53,640
front.
Yep.

2377
01:49:54,010 --> 01:49:56,410
That's like Veronica.
It was so simple.

2378
01:49:57,070 --> 01:49:57,903
Like,
you wouldn't make this now because I'll 

2379
01:49:58,670 --> 01:50:01,450
Gilligan's island speed buggy.
That's me.

2380
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:03,113
Could you make Gilligan's island without
people banging a fuck with believe that 

2381
01:50:07,910 --> 01:50:08,743
he's telling me the only one that's 
banging his Thurston Howell and his 

2382
01:50:12,371 --> 01:50:14,500
wife.
They're the only ones who are banging.

2383
01:50:14,630 --> 01:50:16,240
The only ones that are married,
lovey.

2384
01:50:16,390 --> 01:50:18,650
Nobody else has even kissing.
Nobody.

2385
01:50:19,910 --> 01:50:21,670
The sailor,
the fucking.

2386
01:50:22,020 --> 01:50:24,250
The skipper and Gilligan.
Don't.

2387
01:50:24,251 --> 01:50:26,910
They have bunk beds?
They have a bunk hammocks.

2388
01:50:27,090 --> 01:50:30,400
Is that the most obvious gay couple ever
get over here.

2389
01:50:30,401 --> 01:50:31,630
Little Buddy.
Look at this.

2390
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:36,760
We'll get have to fucking smoking hot 
girls and then there's the two camps.

2391
01:50:37,390 --> 01:50:38,223
Like which camp are you?
You kept ginger or you can't marry in 

2392
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:42,150
like a regular girl.
Look,

2393
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:44,380
I could take fishing like the girl next 
door.

2394
01:50:44,690 --> 01:50:45,820
Yeah,
she looks sexy.

2395
01:50:46,150 --> 01:50:47,950
Girl.
That looks good on the red carpet.

2396
01:50:47,951 --> 01:50:52,180
I'm more ginger type.
I'd rather live in penalty hills and the

2397
01:50:52,181 --> 01:50:54,910
professor was like the intelligent one 
and he wasn't that smart.

2398
01:50:55,090 --> 01:50:57,220
We didn't get to bang either.
Nobody gets to bang.

2399
01:50:57,520 --> 01:50:58,420
Nobody.
Bang.

2400
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:01,330
The professor wasn't intelligent.
Not really.

2401
01:51:01,780 --> 01:51:04,160
It was like 70 science.
Well,

2402
01:51:04,190 --> 01:51:05,830
what did they know back then?
Right now he's like,

2403
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:07,180
look,
I found a bird.

2404
01:51:07,181 --> 01:51:08,540
You can tell by its wings.

2405
01:51:13,550 --> 01:51:14,383
He's not concerned that stupid and bold 
it like birds or pray like they get 

2406
01:51:19,490 --> 01:51:22,240
eaten constantly.
Does that burden have any instincts?

2407
01:51:22,241 --> 01:51:23,620
If you eat it,
it's probably poisoned.

2408
01:51:24,070 --> 01:51:26,860
This was a hit,
a hit.

2409
01:51:26,950 --> 01:51:29,410
He's runaway hit.
He's rehabbing this bird.

2410
01:51:30,220 --> 01:51:31,053
I think if I remember correctly,
Gilligan's island was on for far less 

2411
01:51:34,211 --> 01:51:36,430
time than we think.
Oh really?

2412
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:38,140
Yeah.
I believe that.

2413
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:41,950
I don't think it did a few seasons.
How many seasons if you.

2414
01:51:42,010 --> 01:51:44,140
Yes,
I loved it when I was a child.

2415
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:47,890
Where are we seeing it in reruns for 
sure.

2416
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:49,950
60 seven.
60 four slash 67.

2417
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:51,310
See,
it's only a three year.

2418
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:53,410
A show for years.
How many episodes?

2419
01:51:53,411 --> 01:51:55,300
30 episodes.
That's crazy.

2420
01:51:56,260 --> 01:51:58,840
I guess it's four years.
If they did a full season for each year.

2421
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:01,450
That is pretty short.
That's crazy.

2422
01:52:02,350 --> 01:52:04,870
How many episodes was it?
Say I'm trying to find out.

2423
01:52:04,910 --> 01:52:06,190
Might have been 30 per season.

2424
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:08,350
Really?
That's a lot.

2425
01:52:08,540 --> 01:52:11,310
That's a lot.
It's a lot of storylines usual.

2426
01:52:12,570 --> 01:52:13,403
Usually.
Usually it's 22 because you would get 

2427
01:52:15,491 --> 01:52:16,324
13.
That would be your big order and then 

2428
01:52:17,291 --> 01:52:19,810
you would get the back nine.
This was the olden times.

2429
01:52:20,230 --> 01:52:21,063
Well,
this is real old and times where they 

2430
01:52:21,941 --> 01:52:24,670
didn't get paid.
So Gilgamesh skipper and everybody,

2431
01:52:24,671 --> 01:52:26,770
they got fucked,
played these things.

2432
01:52:27,070 --> 01:52:29,740
They're playing them somewhere now,
so whoever owns them,

2433
01:52:29,741 --> 01:52:32,920
they own it forever and you don't get.
You don't get residuals.

2434
01:52:32,950 --> 01:52:34,690
Wow.
Poor Gilligan.

2435
01:52:35,350 --> 01:52:37,780
They paved the way though.
A lot of shitty shows,

2436
01:52:37,781 --> 01:52:40,510
but they're still make like goofy shows.
You know?

2437
01:52:40,511 --> 01:52:41,344
It's interesting like the other kids 
shows that the kids get raised on like 

2438
01:52:43,690 --> 01:52:46,030
these Disney shows and stuff there.
As

2439
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:47,750
goofy as all this stuff in the 
seventies.

2440
01:52:47,780 --> 01:52:49,700
Some of them are funny man.
Yeah,

2441
01:52:49,940 --> 01:52:52,160
Dude.
I watch dog with a blog with my kids.

2442
01:52:53,790 --> 01:52:56,770
It's called dog with a blog and I think 
it's canceled.

2443
01:52:57,680 --> 01:52:58,513
It's canceled now and they're all bummed
out for new episodes to watch a funny 

2444
01:53:02,571 --> 01:53:04,280
show.
Good writing.

2445
01:53:04,980 --> 01:53:06,740
Like it makes me laugh.
I've laughed.

2446
01:53:07,220 --> 01:53:08,510
It's silly.
You know,

2447
01:53:08,511 --> 01:53:10,610
there's,
there's something to that classic rhythm

2448
01:53:10,611 --> 01:53:12,060
of giving you jokes.
Yeah.

2449
01:53:12,470 --> 01:53:12,981
Yeah.
They're,

2450
01:53:12,981 --> 01:53:15,190
they're,
they're traditional sitcoms is what's it

2451
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:18,110
comes worse.
Multi camera and just joke,

2452
01:53:18,111 --> 01:53:18,591
joke,
joke,

2453
01:53:18,591 --> 01:53:19,424
joke,
joke.

2454
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:20,870
Yeah.
Which is good.

2455
01:53:20,871 --> 01:53:22,390
If their jokes are good.
Yeah,

2456
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:23,750
it is good.
If the jokes are good.

2457
01:53:23,751 --> 01:53:26,330
Yeah.
I don't watch them anymore now.

2458
01:53:26,450 --> 01:53:31,450
Well they don't really.
The only ones are the ones on a cbs like

2459
01:53:31,461 --> 01:53:33,170
big bang and they're the only ones who 
still do it.

2460
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:34,033
Yeah.
They're the only ones that really 

2461
01:53:34,730 --> 01:53:35,563
doesn't do it anymore.

2462
01:53:35,660 --> 01:53:39,530
Now they're all single.
Cam NBC like the Carmichael show.

2463
01:53:39,710 --> 01:53:41,500
Is that one?
How's that?

2464
01:53:41,510 --> 01:53:42,251
True.
How do they do,

2465
01:53:42,251 --> 01:53:43,084
do they do okay.
They're still on and it got renewed for 

2466
01:53:44,511 --> 01:53:45,344
another season.
So I mean that's at least what they're 

2467
01:53:46,491 --> 01:53:47,330
looking for.
Probably.

2468
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:48,080
It's.
Well,

2469
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:51,620
I'm sure some people still enjoy it if 
we're talking about it right now,

2470
01:53:51,710 --> 01:53:55,040
you know they do work if they're funny.
And there's funny characters.

2471
01:53:55,041 --> 01:53:58,250
That's a pure.
It's more jokes than the single cameras.

2472
01:53:58,340 --> 01:53:59,600
A lot of work.
You have done one.

2473
01:53:59,630 --> 01:54:01,110
You did one right now.
I ended up.

2474
01:54:01,730 --> 01:54:04,850
Well you didn't have a sitcom.
You had six episodes.

2475
01:54:05,190 --> 01:54:06,180
Yeah.
What was it?

2476
01:54:06,280 --> 01:54:08,200
It's called come to papa,
come to papa.

2477
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:10,690
And uh,
it was just like a little song.

2478
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:12,520
NBC.
Yeah,

2479
01:54:12,570 --> 01:54:14,420
man,
they kill them.

2480
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:18,410
It was really quick.
I'm glad I did it,

2481
01:54:18,411 --> 01:54:19,430
but I would never do it again.

2482
01:54:19,490 --> 01:54:22,310
You wouldn't know why work.
Yeah.

2483
01:54:22,370 --> 01:54:23,203
It's so much work.
It's a great thing to do if you want to 

2484
01:54:25,221 --> 01:54:27,770
be an actor,
but if you want to do standup as well,

2485
01:54:28,850 --> 01:54:29,683
no way.
Not especially not in the beginning 

2486
01:54:31,310 --> 01:54:34,540
because in the beginning it's ruthless.
It's like 12 hour days every day.

2487
01:54:34,541 --> 01:54:37,010
You're always tired and you're not even 
writing on it.

2488
01:54:37,011 --> 01:54:38,400
You're just acting in.
But you.

2489
01:54:38,930 --> 01:54:41,030
The only good thing is sometimes you 
have time during the day,

2490
01:54:41,031 --> 01:54:43,190
like you might have a couple hours break
during the day.

2491
01:54:43,220 --> 01:54:45,860
You might even be able to go to the gym.
You might be able to,

2492
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:46,833
like,
if you know you're not in like four 

2493
01:54:47,361 --> 01:54:49,550
scenes in a row,
they'll tell you like,

2494
01:54:49,551 --> 01:54:50,121
hey,
you know,

2495
01:54:50,121 --> 01:54:52,500
we don't need you until noon.
You can bust out of that.

2496
01:54:52,580 --> 01:54:54,410
Sometimes you can bust out.
Right.

2497
01:54:54,590 --> 01:54:57,500
But that's not often.
But you'd be able to write a little bit.

2498
01:54:57,500 --> 01:54:58,880
Maybe it's,
yeah.

2499
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:00,233
You know,
and the guys who are in it and write on 

2500
01:55:03,081 --> 01:55:03,980
it,
then forget it,

2501
01:55:04,010 --> 01:55:06,170
and then you're when all the actors go 
home,

2502
01:55:06,171 --> 01:55:08,720
then you go start going to work in the 
writer's room.

2503
01:55:08,780 --> 01:55:09,613
I never forget.
I had lunch with Ray Romano when ray 

2504
01:55:12,170 --> 01:55:14,240
was,
when he was just starting to do.

2505
01:55:14,241 --> 01:55:18,650
Everybody loves Raymond and I was me and
him and Kevin James and we're at Jerry's

2506
01:55:18,651 --> 01:55:21,940
Deli and all Ray Romano.
He's obsessed with his show.

2507
01:55:21,941 --> 01:55:22,640
He's like,
well,

2508
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:25,440
how about if I had the guy?
He comes in here,

2509
01:55:25,441 --> 01:55:28,990
he walks in the door and that's a.
that's how we set up the scene.

2510
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:32,960
Like he just feels like the reason why 
that show had become that monster hit,

2511
01:55:32,961 --> 01:55:33,794
that it was like he was a great comic 
who is obsessed with every fiber of his 

2512
01:55:38,871 --> 01:55:41,150
being making this a really good show.
Yeah.

2513
01:55:41,170 --> 01:55:43,010
That's probably a really,
really to this day,

2514
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:43,853
underrated show.

2515
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:46,260
Everybody loves Raymond.
A great family show.

2516
01:55:46,290 --> 01:55:47,970
Great show.
So funny.

2517
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:50,160
He's a funny dude too.
He is funny.

2518
01:55:50,370 --> 01:55:54,630
I worked with him in Queens,
New York at Jimmy's comedy.

2519
01:55:54,631 --> 01:55:56,700
Allie,
do you ever know that place is?

2520
01:55:56,710 --> 01:55:57,860
Never heard of it?
I never,

2521
01:55:57,980 --> 01:55:58,813
never there.
It was an old bowling alley that they 

2522
01:55:59,971 --> 01:56:03,240
converted to a comedy club.
Great spot.

2523
01:56:03,260 --> 01:56:04,980
Was it?
It was a great spot.

2524
01:56:05,070 --> 01:56:05,903
It was a great spot and I.
I was the Middle Act and he was the 

2525
01:56:09,181 --> 01:56:10,014
headliner x Ray Romano and I remember 
like sitting back after the show was 

2526
01:56:14,550 --> 01:56:16,860
after I did my car wash and go,
God damn,

2527
01:56:16,861 --> 01:56:17,910
this guy's a good joke.
Right?

2528
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:22,650
So smooth and it's timing.
And I ran into him at stand up New York,

2529
01:56:22,651 --> 01:56:24,930
same thing.
I thought I did well and then ray walked

2530
01:56:24,931 --> 01:56:26,550
in and went on and I was like,
oh boy.

2531
01:56:26,610 --> 01:56:29,190
So good.
He was freely so smooth.

2532
01:56:30,390 --> 01:56:31,223
He was talking theater.
He was talking about somebody actually 

2533
01:56:34,350 --> 01:56:36,420
saw another guy steal his joke and I was
so upset.

2534
01:56:36,890 --> 01:56:41,190
I just joke about a movie theaters as 
you go with your guy friends and there's

2535
01:56:41,191 --> 01:56:42,024
always the.
I'm not a homo seat going off about the 

2536
01:56:45,991 --> 01:56:46,824
insecurity of men.
They don't want to sit next to each 

2537
01:56:48,121 --> 01:56:52,140
other,
but everyone's a hard schedule though.

2538
01:56:52,170 --> 01:56:53,430
Well,
how long were you doing it?

2539
01:56:53,460 --> 01:56:55,230
That was five years.
Five years?

2540
01:56:55,290 --> 01:56:57,540
Yeah.
I did it for five seasons.

2541
01:56:57,690 --> 01:56:58,501
That's,
that's good.

2542
01:56:58,501 --> 01:57:00,230
That's a good run.
Uh,

2543
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:01,320
yeah,
I guess.

2544
01:57:01,410 --> 01:57:02,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

2545
01:57:02,730 --> 01:57:05,280
I mean it was good.
It was an interesting thing to do.

2546
01:57:05,281 --> 01:57:08,520
We did 90,
I think 98 or 99 episodes.

2547
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:10,320
It was weird,
man.

2548
01:57:10,890 --> 01:57:12,660
It's a lot of work.
Yeah.

2549
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:15,500
Yeah.
But no,

2550
01:57:15,770 --> 01:57:17,380
it was an awesome thing to do.
Yeah.

2551
01:57:17,670 --> 01:57:21,060
But I think that today,
like as back then,

2552
01:57:21,180 --> 01:57:22,170
that's all there was.

2553
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:24,960
There was no reality shows.
There was no anything else.

2554
01:57:24,961 --> 01:57:26,970
There was a few dramas like cop shows 
and shit.

2555
01:57:27,330 --> 01:57:29,790
There were multiple nights of all 
comedies.

2556
01:57:30,390 --> 01:57:32,610
Thursday night was like all sitcoms on 
NBC.

2557
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,160
That was like the big lineup.
Yeah,

2558
01:57:34,170 --> 01:57:34,800
right.
Yeah.

2559
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:38,110
What do they have on Thursday night tv?
So I don't know.

2560
01:57:38,190 --> 01:57:41,340
I have no idea they have.
And uh,

2561
01:57:41,790 --> 01:57:45,050
I know is not watch any of that stuff as
law and order NBC.

2562
01:57:45,090 --> 01:57:46,890
Yes.
What the fuck is with people?

2563
01:57:46,891 --> 01:57:49,980
Why are we so obsessed with people 
getting caught murdering people?

2564
01:57:50,310 --> 01:57:52,320
I don't know.
I know someone was saying that,

2565
01:57:52,321 --> 01:57:53,154
uh,
like there's another podcast that just 

2566
01:57:55,111 --> 01:57:57,120
came out that's really probably all 
about murders.

2567
01:57:57,290 --> 01:58:00,090
It's just people love murder.
I'm sure.

2568
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:01,230
I know.
I don't get that.

2569
01:58:01,260 --> 01:58:03,000
They love mysteries.
Mystery.

2570
01:58:03,330 --> 01:58:06,510
What's going to happen?
Is it going to get caught?

2571
01:58:06,511 --> 01:58:07,740
Willie Mack,
you know,

2572
01:58:07,741 --> 01:58:08,574
there's a podcast.
It's out now specifically about the 

2573
01:58:10,771 --> 01:58:12,840
mystery of where's Richard Simmons?
Oh,

2574
01:58:12,841 --> 01:58:17,380
that's my podcast.
It's called come to papa,

2575
01:58:17,410 --> 01:58:20,400
but it's really about Richard Simmons 
and back to come to papa.

2576
01:58:20,401 --> 01:58:22,260
I'll be in Syracuse,
May 14th,

2577
01:58:22,370 --> 01:58:25,410
15th,
and now Richard Seguin of where I am.

2578
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:28,500
Whereas Richard Simmons.
Is that a real thing?

2579
01:58:28,630 --> 01:58:29,900
Oh yeah.
It's a real pocket.

2580
01:58:29,910 --> 01:58:31,980
Like they can talk to multiple days 
about that forever.

2581
01:58:32,010 --> 01:58:33,420
They can talk to the end of the time.
They're gay.

2582
01:58:34,060 --> 01:58:36,870
If you're gay and you're on adderall and
you talk about Richard Simmons,

2583
01:58:36,871 --> 01:58:38,490
you could probably keep going,
keep going,

2584
01:58:38,491 --> 01:58:40,320
keep going.
And he was amazing.

2585
01:58:40,630 --> 01:58:41,880
Pioneer.
Okay.

2586
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:44,740
Give him some fucking respect to the 
left.

2587
01:58:44,980 --> 01:58:47,950
He's a goddamn pioneer,
but do something about that here.

2588
01:58:47,951 --> 01:58:49,890
Sarah.
Sir.

2589
01:58:49,900 --> 01:58:52,850
That's why people love murder.
I was not,

2590
01:58:52,851 --> 01:58:55,000
I don't like murder.
I don't like hospital shows,

2591
01:58:55,001 --> 01:58:55,834
I don't like.
My wife was addicted to a autopsy shows 

2592
01:58:58,661 --> 01:58:59,494
when she was pregnant,
what it kicked in and she couldn't stop 

2593
01:59:01,871 --> 01:59:06,640
watching autopsy shows on Hbo Guy.
Yeah,

2594
01:59:06,730 --> 01:59:07,563
I think that was it.
Michael Baton would catch people in the 

2595
01:59:09,341 --> 01:59:10,280
weirdest ways.
Yeah.

2596
01:59:10,380 --> 01:59:11,560
Ooh,
weird.

2597
01:59:11,610 --> 01:59:13,620
There was one guy who had.
He had a.

2598
01:59:13,630 --> 01:59:14,463
He was a doctor and you have this woman 
and he kept her body in his house and 

2599
01:59:18,671 --> 01:59:22,870
you bring in crates and crates a perfume
and you had douse her decaying body with

2600
01:59:22,871 --> 01:59:27,871
perfume and he had fast and some sort of
a hole near where her abdomen was.

2601
01:59:28,511 --> 01:59:30,710
When it rotted away,
he put something.

2602
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:31,713
He put something there,
said he manufacturer where he could 

2603
01:59:33,941 --> 01:59:35,200
stick his dick into it.

2604
01:59:36,060 --> 01:59:40,090
It put a put a mask on her and you know,
they.

2605
01:59:40,210 --> 01:59:42,700
They were trying to figure out where the
body had gone.

2606
01:59:42,701 --> 01:59:46,030
This guy had taken the body and brought 
it to his house.

2607
01:59:47,110 --> 01:59:49,630
It was so intense.
It was so intense.

2608
01:59:49,650 --> 01:59:50,320
I'm like,
ah,

2609
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:51,550
because I remember thinking like,
wow,

2610
01:59:51,551 --> 01:59:55,630
this guy wanted this woman so bad that 
once she died he couldn't help himself.

2611
01:59:55,631 --> 01:59:58,400
He had to like keep her body.
Now I have her,

2612
01:59:58,630 --> 02:00:00,400
now she's with me.
This is what I've always needed.

2613
02:00:00,401 --> 02:00:01,234
Let me just keep covering her up with 
perfume and he would get rock hard and 

2614
02:00:03,971 --> 02:00:08,840
climb on top of her rotting bag of bones
and meat and stick his dick anywhere.

2615
02:00:08,910 --> 02:00:09,743
She's just,
he's probably at like a surgical mask 

2616
02:00:11,111 --> 02:00:11,944
on.
She's like stinking of rotten meat and 

2617
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:16,930
perfume.
I would much rather watch Bob's burgers.

2618
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:19,360
Yeah.
I got a little graphic folks.

2619
02:00:19,450 --> 02:00:22,030
You got really into it and it was 
disturbing.

2620
02:00:22,180 --> 02:00:23,013
Well,
I just see this is why these shows are 

2621
02:00:24,311 --> 02:00:27,250
popular because it like,
you know,

2622
02:00:27,460 --> 02:00:29,350
man,
I don't even watch that anymore.

2623
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:31,233
Me Describing that and putting that 
visual image to everybody's mind is 

2624
02:00:33,761 --> 02:00:37,030
nothing like watching and getting that 
visual image.

2625
02:00:37,060 --> 02:00:40,210
It's so much more innocent and less 
guilty.

2626
02:00:40,420 --> 02:00:41,253
It's worse because now you made us a 
part of it because we had to picture 

2627
02:00:44,260 --> 02:00:45,093
painted ourselves.
You've got to know those people were 

2628
02:00:46,391 --> 02:00:47,680
real though.
You know,

2629
02:00:48,630 --> 02:00:51,670
you do have to know those nurse one's 
always freaked me out.

2630
02:00:51,790 --> 02:00:53,830
Find some nurses,
killed 50 people.

2631
02:00:53,860 --> 02:00:54,700
You're like,
what?

2632
02:00:55,220 --> 02:00:57,490
Had just quietly quietly poisoning 
people.

2633
02:00:58,480 --> 02:00:59,920
These people are doing so good.
Tom.

2634
02:00:59,921 --> 02:01:01,520
Papa.
I just have a tooth.

2635
02:01:01,640 --> 02:01:03,730
Big.
We're going to have to amputate.

2636
02:01:03,770 --> 02:01:04,603
What?
Wait.

2637
02:01:04,830 --> 02:01:06,940
Hold on.
This nurse crap.

2638
02:01:08,270 --> 02:01:13,270
I mean that power rush must get from 
doing crazy shit like that.

2639
02:01:14,780 --> 02:01:16,690
There was an autopsy.
Shows are fucking weird.

2640
02:01:16,691 --> 02:01:17,524
Man was a weird compelling fascination 
that had happened to her while she was 

2641
02:01:21,161 --> 02:01:21,994
pregnant was like this weird,
like definitely like something physical 

2642
02:01:25,421 --> 02:01:26,254
and mental was happening.
We start getting nervous about your 

2643
02:01:27,881 --> 02:01:30,040
environment.
How safe are we?

2644
02:01:30,100 --> 02:01:30,933
What's cool,
what?

2645
02:01:30,950 --> 02:01:31,783
What are people capable of?
You want to know what everything is and 

2646
02:01:33,491 --> 02:01:34,324
you see ice tea kicking in the door to 
some house and it's a woman gagged 

2647
02:01:38,380 --> 02:01:40,070
special victims unit.
I'm here.

2648
02:01:41,820 --> 02:01:43,910
Body check out.
My new album dropped Monday.

2649
02:01:43,970 --> 02:01:47,390
Bombbomb.
She'd never done it.

2650
02:01:47,580 --> 02:01:48,890
Bombbomb,
take them away.

2651
02:01:49,810 --> 02:01:53,330
They get them in the end always because 
it's law and order.

2652
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:54,193
Bomb bomb.
It's not law and hopefully we have 

2653
02:01:56,391 --> 02:02:01,340
order.
We enforce the law with ice t bomp,

2654
02:02:01,350 --> 02:02:06,350
bomp and Richard Belzer Belzer what a 
weird career battles or two calls ago,

2655
02:02:07,540 --> 02:02:12,540
and a rapper they just go from.
It's important comic of his time,

2656
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:16,820
New York and then palm palm for them for
the last 30,

2657
02:02:16,821 --> 02:02:20,120
just reading stale lines.
Thirty years.

2658
02:02:20,150 --> 02:02:21,890
Like how many years was he on that show?
Yeah,

2659
02:02:22,010 --> 02:02:24,050
I think.
I think maybe you think that's where the

2660
02:02:24,051 --> 02:02:27,570
body is so weird.
Probably like.

2661
02:02:27,770 --> 02:02:32,770
I bet he was on that show for 15 years.
The Bom Bom.

2662
02:02:34,010 --> 02:02:34,843
That's crazy,
but I guess that paycheck is just want 

2663
02:02:38,790 --> 02:02:43,670
to go to giggles and Saugus no guy.
I'm not going to have a weekend.

2664
02:02:43,910 --> 02:02:45,740
Some drunk asshole is going to heckle 
you over there.

2665
02:02:45,740 --> 02:02:46,573
Pizza?
No,

2666
02:02:46,580 --> 02:02:47,413
I'm done with that.
You'd have the sunglasses on and just 

2667
02:02:49,161 --> 02:02:50,480
that attitude.
Harris?

2668
02:02:50,590 --> 02:02:52,310
No.
Do you remember that?

2669
02:02:52,370 --> 02:02:53,203
Yeah.
When you live in New York and you work 

2670
02:02:54,891 --> 02:02:56,780
in New York,
you can live in Paris.

2671
02:02:57,320 --> 02:02:59,540
That's like a far away.
It's five hours flight.

2672
02:02:59,541 --> 02:03:01,040
It's like it's coming here.
Yeah,

2673
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:03,440
it isn't coming here.
Just kind of go through customs.

2674
02:03:03,450 --> 02:03:06,830
New York's in the middle and so like 
Johnny Depp lived in Paris for awhile.

2675
02:03:08,300 --> 02:03:09,290
I wouldn't work.
I did it.

2676
02:03:09,460 --> 02:03:12,560
No is he started hammering people,
hammering them.

2677
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:16,340
I don't know.
I go on vacations and I'm like,

2678
02:03:16,670 --> 02:03:18,860
go to like some foreign country and 
you're like,

2679
02:03:18,861 --> 02:03:20,960
this is so great.
And it's like after a couple of days,

2680
02:03:20,980 --> 02:03:22,910
like I got to get back to the states.
Yeah.

2681
02:03:22,940 --> 02:03:25,400
I don't understand people like I'm 
moving to Costa Rica.

2682
02:03:25,460 --> 02:03:26,950
Fuck it.
No,

2683
02:03:27,170 --> 02:03:29,730
you're doing what right?
No,

2684
02:03:29,750 --> 02:03:30,141
no,
no,

2685
02:03:30,141 --> 02:03:30,531
no,
no,

2686
02:03:30,531 --> 02:03:30,860
no,
no.

2687
02:03:30,860 --> 02:03:33,550
You visit their vacation.
Yeah.

2688
02:03:33,560 --> 02:03:34,880
What are you doing?
Why would you move there?

2689
02:03:34,910 --> 02:03:37,160
I want to go live.
Their coastal work is amazing,

2690
02:03:37,161 --> 02:03:38,210
Bro.
It is amazing.

2691
02:03:38,630 --> 02:03:39,650
It's amazing.
When you visit,

2692
02:03:40,100 --> 02:03:41,210
what if you live there?
You would go,

2693
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:42,980
oh,
you have to bribe the cops.

2694
02:03:43,030 --> 02:03:44,660
You've got,
oh,

2695
02:03:44,661 --> 02:03:45,910
this is a toll.
I wasn't.

2696
02:03:46,070 --> 02:03:48,350
I was in Costa Rica on vacation with my 
fucking kids.

2697
02:03:48,351 --> 02:03:49,184
Dude.
I'm walking my kids on the beach and 

2698
02:03:49,791 --> 02:03:50,624
this guy goes,
hey man,

2699
02:03:50,780 --> 02:03:51,810
do you want weed?
Do you want coke?

2700
02:03:51,811 --> 02:03:52,970
What do you want?
No girls.

2701
02:03:52,971 --> 02:03:53,804
I'm like,
Hey,

2702
02:03:54,110 --> 02:03:56,210
listen buddy.
Come on man.

2703
02:03:56,510 --> 02:03:58,280
I'm here,
I want all those things,

2704
02:03:58,281 --> 02:03:59,114
but I don't want to right now they don't
ever real police force fire forest 

2705
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:05,240
running waters.
Intermittent,

2706
02:04:05,510 --> 02:04:06,343
no Gimme convenience.
One time it was in Mexico and I was at 

2707
02:04:08,931 --> 02:04:12,200
this resort and they had these like 
electric golf carts.

2708
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:13,033
You can take the carts out of the resort
to go to a like a the local town and so 

2709
02:04:17,511 --> 02:04:18,344
we left the resort and went to the local
town and maybe a block outside of the 

2710
02:04:24,711 --> 02:04:28,010
resort.
There was a full on military compound.

2711
02:04:28,580 --> 02:04:33,580
I mean full on with dudes standing there
fully armed in a jeep,

2712
02:04:34,070 --> 02:04:37,770
an armored jeep with a like a 
bulletproof face to face.

2713
02:04:37,950 --> 02:04:41,100
They like ducked down while they're 
driving so they don't get shot.

2714
02:04:41,490 --> 02:04:45,720
And I'm watching this and I'm like,
what in the hell on the street realized,

2715
02:04:45,810 --> 02:04:48,150
Oh,
this is to protect the resort.

2716
02:04:49,080 --> 02:04:50,760
Oh my God.
Oh course.

2717
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:55,190
It changed my entire feeling of what I 
was doing before.

2718
02:04:55,400 --> 02:04:56,250
I was like,
Hey,

2719
02:04:56,251 --> 02:04:57,084
we're relaxing on the beach or Jamaica.
We're going to have some Mai Tai's and 

2720
02:05:02,910 --> 02:05:06,330
kick back and look sad and it's so 
beautiful.

2721
02:05:06,331 --> 02:05:07,164
I love Mexico.
I don't want everybody thinks is 

2722
02:05:08,071 --> 02:05:08,904
dangerous.
Then there's guys with machine guns and 

2723
02:05:15,841 --> 02:05:17,790
if they're not there,
we're all dead.

2724
02:05:17,820 --> 02:05:18,390
Oh,
you're fucked.

2725
02:05:18,390 --> 02:05:20,190
You're fucked.
Because of the people from the town.

2726
02:05:20,370 --> 02:05:22,200
We'll just go,
why do they have so much?

2727
02:05:22,201 --> 02:05:23,290
And we don't.
There's so

2728
02:05:23,690 --> 02:05:27,530
they're so poor and then you're bringing
in all these people with a lot of money.

2729
02:05:27,620 --> 02:05:28,970
Yeah.
Scary.

2730
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:29,780
Yeah,
it was,

2731
02:05:29,780 --> 02:05:30,613
it was in A.
I just went to Dominican Republic and 

2732
02:05:32,871 --> 02:05:34,080
they're like,
uh.

2733
02:05:34,580 --> 02:05:36,800
I said,
where do you stay in Puntacana?

2734
02:05:37,190 --> 02:05:39,560
That's where I was doing the show and 
they're like,

2735
02:05:39,590 --> 02:05:41,990
that's the only place to stay.
And I was like,

2736
02:05:42,020 --> 02:05:44,510
isn't that bad?
And as I'm landing I'm like,

2737
02:05:44,570 --> 02:05:49,550
just look up to make it.
Like someone was doing a live,

2738
02:05:49,890 --> 02:05:50,723
a facebook live thing,
like in a studio and some guy walked in 

2739
02:05:53,181 --> 02:05:54,014
and just shot him in the middle of it.
That was like happening as I'm like 

2740
02:05:57,140 --> 02:06:00,680
nervously trying to find my guide to 
bring me to the resort.

2741
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:03,620
It's always just on the outskirts of 
these places.

2742
02:06:04,430 --> 02:06:05,640
Yeah.
Well that was going on.

2743
02:06:05,730 --> 02:06:06,563
Acapulco.
Remember our member during the drug war 

2744
02:06:09,201 --> 02:06:10,430
when it was at its worst.

2745
02:06:10,570 --> 02:06:13,280
Oh yeah.
Mexican drug war was going on down there

2746
02:06:13,281 --> 02:06:16,100
and Aco Poco.
A bunch of people got shot like tourists

2747
02:06:16,101 --> 02:06:18,050
and shit.
She's now.

2748
02:06:18,051 --> 02:06:18,884
It's serious stuff.
My parents went to Mexico when I was a 

2749
02:06:20,661 --> 02:06:25,520
boy and brought back a shirt that's was 
a Mexican guy and his sombreros said Aco

2750
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:27,670
Poco and his bow tie said gold.
Oh,

2751
02:06:29,410 --> 02:06:31,460
that was my cool shirt.
Tim.

2752
02:06:31,850 --> 02:06:33,320
Tom.
Papa knows where the good weed.

2753
02:06:34,230 --> 02:06:34,540
My.
Yeah.

2754
02:06:34,540 --> 02:06:37,080
They would grow weed and Aco Poco.
They're called Acapulco gold.

2755
02:06:37,130 --> 02:06:38,780
Acapulco gold.
That was the shit.

2756
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:39,673
Yeah,
man.

2757
02:06:39,680 --> 02:06:41,120
Remember that?
I got the shirt.

2758
02:06:41,210 --> 02:06:43,850
I never had any of that stuff mean I 
didn't smoke weed.

2759
02:06:43,880 --> 02:06:46,000
I bet it wasn't that great.
Now,

2760
02:06:46,050 --> 02:06:48,380
compared to this science we had no,
no way.

2761
02:06:49,220 --> 02:06:51,080
No Way.
God Damn Wizards.

2762
02:06:51,320 --> 02:06:53,570
Yeah.
I get uncomfortable in those places.

2763
02:06:53,630 --> 02:06:54,463
I uh,
I always wanted to be like the cool 

2764
02:06:56,061 --> 02:06:56,894
photo journalists who kind of hangs out 
with the people and there's doesn't 

2765
02:06:59,601 --> 02:07:01,760
worry and just goes to their house and 
has a meal.

2766
02:07:02,300 --> 02:07:06,080
But I'm totally on guard and nervous 
when I'm in places like that,

2767
02:07:06,230 --> 02:07:08,690
especially with my family.
Well,

2768
02:07:08,691 --> 02:07:11,390
if you're in a real poor area and you,
you know,

2769
02:07:11,391 --> 02:07:14,070
you're a bunch of wealthy white people 
that are fucking vacation.

2770
02:07:14,120 --> 02:07:14,953
Yeah.
It's weird because the area needs it 

2771
02:07:16,730 --> 02:07:18,500
because it provides,
you know,

2772
02:07:18,501 --> 02:07:21,770
like your revenue comes in and it helps 
them and it gives people that live their

2773
02:07:21,771 --> 02:07:23,990
jobs.
It's again,

2774
02:07:23,991 --> 02:07:27,390
like we were talking about going outside
of Albany,

2775
02:07:27,440 --> 02:07:29,000
you just drive two hours outside of 
Albany,

2776
02:07:29,001 --> 02:07:31,220
like where the fuck am I?
It's the same thing.

2777
02:07:31,560 --> 02:07:33,650
Yeah.
But probably more extreme.

2778
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:34,431
Right,
exactly.

2779
02:07:34,431 --> 02:07:36,460
Because there's not as many cops.
Yeah.

2780
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:37,353
Right.
Yeah.

2781
02:07:37,480 --> 02:07:39,730
Yeah.
And being a cop is a different thing.

2782
02:07:40,210 --> 02:07:43,520
If everybody's corrupt right now.
Narcos.

2783
02:07:43,900 --> 02:07:46,030
Yeah.
Woo Hoo.

2784
02:07:46,150 --> 02:07:49,000
God down 10 sat down.
That's a good show.

2785
02:07:49,810 --> 02:07:50,643
Narcos is scared.
Pablo Escobar lived a fucking crazy 

2786
02:07:53,591 --> 02:07:54,130
life.

2787
02:07:54,130 --> 02:07:58,480
Crazy late with his pot belly.
How did he do that?

2788
02:07:59,680 --> 02:08:02,680
It's amazing how far some people get 
with insane behavior.

2789
02:08:02,740 --> 02:08:04,360
It really is amazing,
isn't it?

2790
02:08:04,420 --> 02:08:06,960
Whoa.
That guy was just completely like,

2791
02:08:06,970 --> 02:08:08,170
no,
I'm going to make this work.

2792
02:08:08,290 --> 02:08:10,100
This is how my head works,
man.

2793
02:08:10,120 --> 02:08:13,420
He was blown up government buildings and
airplanes.

2794
02:08:14,110 --> 02:08:15,760
Scary.
Built his own jail,

2795
02:08:16,090 --> 02:08:16,923
put himself in a jail and partying.
They're bringing them bitches and 

2796
02:08:19,441 --> 02:08:22,600
playing pool and handing out cash to the
people.

2797
02:08:22,601 --> 02:08:24,280
He was a hero.
Then afterwards he's like,

2798
02:08:24,281 --> 02:08:25,690
you know what?
I'm tired of being this fucking place.

2799
02:08:25,870 --> 02:08:28,780
Murdered a guy in the jail.
Lead them to hit in the head with a bat.

2800
02:08:28,840 --> 02:08:30,420
Yeah,
and then he's like,

2801
02:08:30,421 --> 02:08:32,350
ah,
fuck this place it just getting out.

2802
02:08:32,351 --> 02:08:37,351
I'm believing was a little sneakers so 
crazy running down the path,

2803
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:38,673
but this is all real things.
It's insane when you think how far that 

2804
02:08:43,811 --> 02:08:45,280
is from how you live your life.

2805
02:08:45,610 --> 02:08:49,960
You know what I mean so far away and it 
just happened.

2806
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:51,550
Yeah,
it's happening right now.

2807
02:08:51,551 --> 02:08:53,890
Some.
Some new guy's on his way working up the

2808
02:08:53,891 --> 02:08:54,724
ladder.
How about when Sean Penn went down and 

2809
02:08:57,701 --> 02:09:00,880
met El Chapo?
Took that fucking picture with him.

2810
02:09:00,930 --> 02:09:01,880
Yeah,
it was like,

2811
02:09:01,900 --> 02:09:04,630
how crazy is Sean Penn?
Was there ever.

2812
02:09:04,690 --> 02:09:05,523
Was there ever an article about that?
Like was there ever like an interview 

2813
02:09:07,481 --> 02:09:09,430
with him and he wrote it?
Sean Penn wrote it.

2814
02:09:09,431 --> 02:09:10,780
I never read it.
I read it.

2815
02:09:10,781 --> 02:09:12,940
I remember the.
I remember the thing going down,

2816
02:09:12,941 --> 02:09:14,620
but I'm just my weird.
It was weird.

2817
02:09:14,770 --> 02:09:15,603
It was like,
I don't understand like what he was 

2818
02:09:16,631 --> 02:09:19,060
trying to do,
like why he decided to do that.

2819
02:09:19,061 --> 02:09:21,880
Look at that fucking picture.
That picture is insane.

2820
02:09:21,881 --> 02:09:23,330
Dude.
Why did he do it?

2821
02:09:23,331 --> 02:09:24,820
Because he's crazy.
So wild man.

2822
02:09:25,900 --> 02:09:28,690
Sean Penn is a wild man.
I mean he really is.

2823
02:09:28,690 --> 02:09:29,523
You have to be to do this.
I had one opinion of him before that I 

2824
02:09:32,291 --> 02:09:33,850
had a different opinion of him after 
this.

2825
02:09:34,150 --> 02:09:36,250
This guy,
he actually did that.

2826
02:09:36,940 --> 02:09:39,250
He actually went there into the woods.
Right?

2827
02:09:39,251 --> 02:09:40,084
Then they put a hood over him or a 
blindfold and remember how it all 

2828
02:09:42,461 --> 02:09:43,294
happened.
But there was some girl who was friends 

2829
02:09:44,740 --> 02:09:45,573
with El Chapo.
El Chapo was probably Dick Dicker way 

2830
02:09:48,191 --> 02:09:50,710
the same way.
Same Way.

2831
02:09:50,950 --> 02:09:51,783
Pablo Escobar quarter shorter.
So El Chapo was probably stuff in that 

2832
02:09:56,081 --> 02:09:58,600
girl too and he's like,
I want you to give me Sean Penn.

2833
02:09:58,780 --> 02:10:00,010
Right?
You're exactly right.

2834
02:10:00,011 --> 02:10:02,740
That's exactly what happened.
I don't know.

2835
02:10:03,010 --> 02:10:04,810
I don't know if he'll do it.
He'll do it.

2836
02:10:05,020 --> 02:10:06,090
He'll do it.
He'll do it.

2837
02:10:06,100 --> 02:10:06,933
Give me jump back.
I went that boyfRiend colors get get 

2838
02:10:11,060 --> 02:10:13,000
healed from fast times at ridgemont 
high.

2839
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:17,170
He'll understand the good part of drugs 
and that's right.

2840
02:10:17,170 --> 02:10:20,230
He was in colors using colors.
Ama nightmare.

2841
02:10:20,231 --> 02:10:22,360
Walked in.
Psychopaths talking ice tea.

2842
02:10:22,361 --> 02:10:24,490
It goes full circle.
We're back to it again.

2843
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:28,840
I did a show last night for a charity 
show and a common was on the show.

2844
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:32,230
The rapper turned.
Now he's a big time actor,

2845
02:10:32,231 --> 02:10:34,670
writer and poet.
What a ppo.

2846
02:10:34,690 --> 02:10:35,451
Yeah,
he's a poet.

2847
02:10:35,451 --> 02:10:38,420
Slow your roll son.
He's a is because you make shit,

2848
02:10:38,421 --> 02:10:41,180
ryan.
I'm published.

2849
02:10:41,240 --> 02:10:42,110
He's a.
He's a.

2850
02:10:42,200 --> 02:10:44,060
He's a positive force.
That guy.

2851
02:10:44,320 --> 02:10:46,250
He is a.
He's a good one for sure.

2852
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:47,113
That's nice.
Yeah,

2853
02:10:47,300 --> 02:10:48,680
it was really.
I was impressed.

2854
02:10:48,710 --> 02:10:50,150
The world needs more poets.
Tom.

2855
02:10:50,151 --> 02:10:50,891
Papa it.
Sure.

2856
02:10:50,891 --> 02:10:53,480
It does not really.
Let me count the ways.

2857
02:10:53,750 --> 02:10:54,381
Poetry.
Boy,

2858
02:10:54,381 --> 02:10:56,270
that's one thing.
You better be good.

2859
02:10:57,880 --> 02:10:59,220
You better be good.
You're right,

2860
02:10:59,360 --> 02:11:01,010
and even if you are half the people are 
gonna hate it.

2861
02:11:01,011 --> 02:11:02,300
It's like a comic.
It's like,

2862
02:11:02,330 --> 02:11:03,650
oh yeah,
you're bad.

2863
02:11:03,650 --> 02:11:05,420
It's really bad.
Even if you're good,

2864
02:11:05,480 --> 02:11:07,790
have you going to hate it?
You're just going to be a certain amount

2865
02:11:07,791 --> 02:11:08,624
of people that hate you no matter what.
You can do your best shit ever and some 

2866
02:11:11,121 --> 02:11:11,954
people could say like,
you'll get like four tweets in a row 

2867
02:11:13,821 --> 02:11:15,950
about a special fucking amazing,
amazing,

2868
02:11:16,040 --> 02:11:16,873
very disappointed.
I was going to be people that hate 

2869
02:11:20,851 --> 02:11:21,684
everything in your audience of people 
who are coming to see who's coming to 

2870
02:11:24,651 --> 02:11:25,484
see you.
There's going to be a couple of people 

2871
02:11:26,481 --> 02:11:27,314
like and there's also people that you're
never going to make happy no matter 

2872
02:11:29,271 --> 02:11:30,061
what.
No.

2873
02:11:30,061 --> 02:11:33,620
Is it just twats?
It's just they just suck.

2874
02:11:34,220 --> 02:11:36,140
It's such a fun word.
Great word.

2875
02:11:36,740 --> 02:11:40,040
God is a good one.
They let us say it on the tv.

2876
02:11:40,041 --> 02:11:41,700
You can say on tv,
right?

2877
02:11:41,720 --> 02:11:42,553
You could say twat.
I bet you think you could say if a girl 

2878
02:11:44,571 --> 02:11:47,080
says it,
my mom's a twat or mom's a twat.

2879
02:11:47,680 --> 02:11:50,510
My swat swat.
If a girl said,

2880
02:11:50,511 --> 02:11:51,344
looking at twat,
you should really think about not doing 

2881
02:11:52,941 --> 02:11:54,800
it.
I know one girl says,

2882
02:11:54,801 --> 02:11:55,420
look,
my twat,

2883
02:11:55,420 --> 02:11:56,040
you go,
whoa.

2884
02:11:56,040 --> 02:11:59,020
It's a twat your,
what do you call it?

2885
02:12:00,390 --> 02:12:01,940
Dang it.
Dang it.

2886
02:12:01,970 --> 02:12:02,980
I was banging.
This girl wants,

2887
02:12:03,150 --> 02:12:06,160
you know,
back in the design when I was 20 and she

2888
02:12:06,161 --> 02:12:07,920
was the first girl to ever call her 
pussy cunt.

2889
02:12:08,940 --> 02:12:10,730
I want you to fuck me in my car.
I was like,

2890
02:12:10,731 --> 02:12:12,030
whoa.
Hello.

2891
02:12:12,320 --> 02:12:13,153
This girl is crazy.
She was one of those nether regions 

2892
02:12:15,651 --> 02:12:17,540
girls.
She was like the wildings,

2893
02:12:17,680 --> 02:12:20,840
you know how the wild were in the game?
A game of thrones,

2894
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:24,470
you know those people that lived out in 
the land between the kingdoms,

2895
02:12:24,471 --> 02:12:25,910
right.
She lived in Connecticut,

2896
02:12:25,970 --> 02:12:26,803
which is my mat.
That's where the wild things live and 

2897
02:12:30,740 --> 02:12:35,300
those weird New York and Massachusetts,
Connecticut or some shit like that.

2898
02:12:35,340 --> 02:12:36,540
Like,
what are you doing it?

2899
02:12:37,230 --> 02:12:39,960
She was just,
she really,

2900
02:12:40,020 --> 02:12:42,500
she was crazy.
She was so crazy.

2901
02:12:42,501 --> 02:12:45,740
I went to the bathroom once and she gave
my friend her phone number,

2902
02:12:45,741 --> 02:12:49,940
like immediately after I'd already been 
having sex after I had sex with that day

2903
02:12:50,360 --> 02:12:53,180
and she gave my friend her phone.
She was crazy.

2904
02:12:53,450 --> 02:12:54,283
But you know,
women don't like any guy that would not 

2905
02:12:56,721 --> 02:13:00,610
tell you that some girl gave,
you know,

2906
02:13:00,611 --> 02:13:02,840
the year you're dating gave him her 
number.

2907
02:13:02,841 --> 02:13:04,220
that's like,
yeah,

2908
02:13:04,250 --> 02:13:06,740
a bad guy to have with.
Did he Tell you fuck you.

2909
02:13:06,741 --> 02:13:07,261
I did.
Oh,

2910
02:13:07,261 --> 02:13:08,001
that's good.
He goes,

2911
02:13:08,001 --> 02:13:09,960
dude,
he goes crazy bushes.

2912
02:13:10,040 --> 02:13:13,070
As soon as you went to pete gave me.
She gave me her number.

2913
02:13:13,071 --> 02:13:13,904
I go,
no way.

2914
02:13:14,300 --> 02:13:15,350
Showed me the piece of paper.
Oh,

2915
02:13:15,351 --> 02:13:17,030
that's cute.
He goes,

2916
02:13:17,031 --> 02:13:17,811
go show it to her.
I go,

2917
02:13:17,811 --> 02:13:19,340
okay.
I go,

2918
02:13:19,341 --> 02:13:24,341
did you leave this with my friend 
started laughing.

2919
02:13:25,430 --> 02:13:28,880
When she say she was so stupid.
She was crazy.

2920
02:13:28,910 --> 02:13:32,220
She was more crazy than she was stupid.
And what did you see her often?

2921
02:13:32,700 --> 02:13:35,070
I saw when I would go to Connecticut,
right?

2922
02:13:35,071 --> 02:13:36,890
Like every,
you know,

2923
02:13:37,350 --> 02:13:39,480
five,
six months for like a year and a half.

2924
02:13:39,560 --> 02:13:41,190
Right.
And the last one was like,

2925
02:13:41,250 --> 02:13:43,500
I gotta stop.
I gotta stop hanging out with this girl.

2926
02:13:43,501 --> 02:13:44,334
She was way too crazy.
She came to one of my comedy shows and 

2927
02:13:46,711 --> 02:13:51,711
she brought these people that might as 
well been screaming baboons trapped in a

2928
02:13:52,921 --> 02:13:54,150
cage at the zoo.
Well,

2929
02:13:54,180 --> 02:13:57,900
people threw water balloons.
There was screaming.

2930
02:13:58,020 --> 02:14:02,100
They were heckling and screaming and 
then I left her there.

2931
02:14:02,580 --> 02:14:05,700
I left her and her friends there.
I just bolted as soon as I got off stage

2932
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:08,490
and just went outside,
got in my car and just drove.

2933
02:14:09,120 --> 02:14:11,340
And back then when you drove,
you were gone?

2934
02:14:11,850 --> 02:14:13,650
Nobody had a cell phone.
That's right.

2935
02:14:13,651 --> 02:14:16,210
You could escape.
You can literally get escape.

2936
02:14:16,310 --> 02:14:17,143
I actually had a cell phone before that 
but I couldn't afford it anymore so I 

2937
02:14:19,681 --> 02:14:20,190
didn't have a.

2938
02:14:20,190 --> 02:14:24,360
So I had a car phone for awhile in like 
1989 nights.

2939
02:14:24,420 --> 02:14:27,210
This was like a year or two after that.
I was like 90 or 91,

2940
02:14:27,211 --> 02:14:28,880
so I don't even think anybody could get 
ahold of me.

2941
02:14:28,940 --> 02:14:31,080
That's cool.
You could just get in the car and go.

2942
02:14:31,140 --> 02:14:32,410
Oh yeah.
No one could find you.

2943
02:14:32,440 --> 02:14:34,410
You just go.
So great.

2944
02:14:34,440 --> 02:14:35,270
well,
I used to have these,

2945
02:14:35,270 --> 02:14:36,103
like one of the things I really like 
about these yellow legal pads is that 

2946
02:14:39,241 --> 02:14:40,074
these yellow legal pads to me,
they have like this different feel to 

2947
02:14:44,371 --> 02:14:45,204
them because that's what I would write 
all the directions to places that I 

2948
02:14:48,871 --> 02:14:51,360
would go to because there was no 
internet back then.

2949
02:14:51,450 --> 02:14:54,450
So you would get lIke a gig from like 
the comedy connection,

2950
02:14:54,451 --> 02:14:56,010
like Billy Downs would be booking a 
room.

2951
02:14:56,020 --> 02:14:58,560
You call him up and he would give you 
the directions,

2952
02:14:58,561 --> 02:14:58,800
you know.

2953
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:00,870
Okay.
You got a pen?

2954
02:15:01,080 --> 02:15:02,130
Yeah,
hold on a second.

2955
02:15:02,290 --> 02:15:04,550
And it was always,
I would write it all on these legal,

2956
02:15:04,620 --> 02:15:05,453
legal,
a yellow legal pads and then I would 

2957
02:15:07,321 --> 02:15:10,590
write down the address and directions 
how to get there,

2958
02:15:10,591 --> 02:15:11,424
what to look for.
There's a third bar and that's the one 

2959
02:15:12,691 --> 02:15:17,430
you want to turn and then you'll see the
fucking wings hot is that amazing?

2960
02:15:17,940 --> 02:15:20,610
So crazy.
But I would have them with me and I'd be

2961
02:15:20,611 --> 02:15:22,650
all excited because I look at that piece
of paper.

2962
02:15:22,651 --> 02:15:25,290
I'd be like,
I'm a hitman going out to do a job,

2963
02:15:25,650 --> 02:15:26,820
you know,
sort of felt like,

2964
02:15:26,821 --> 02:15:27,810
yeah,
I'm in the middle of,

2965
02:15:27,820 --> 02:15:31,950
as I'm driving out in the middle of 
nowhere to disconnected lands.

2966
02:15:32,460 --> 02:15:35,240
So these places like,
is that shit?

2967
02:15:35,590 --> 02:15:37,650
Damn one nighters.
Just drive for mont,

2968
02:15:37,800 --> 02:15:40,490
do a sHow drive back same night.
Yeah.

2969
02:15:40,740 --> 02:15:42,320
I met this pretty girl once in Maine.

2970
02:15:42,580 --> 02:15:46,840
She was really pretty and she had a nose
rings should,

2971
02:15:46,860 --> 02:15:47,693
I think she had two nose rings.
Had a ring in each nostril and like 

2972
02:15:50,581 --> 02:15:51,650
she's still pretty.
Yeah,

2973
02:15:51,990 --> 02:15:52,823
pretty that word.
But it was what it was and we were 

2974
02:15:54,391 --> 02:15:56,850
hanging out and I was,
it was just too heavy.

2975
02:15:57,050 --> 02:15:57,883
I was like,
sHe was so trapped in this weird main 

2976
02:16:00,001 --> 02:16:00,930
town.
Oh yeah.

2977
02:16:00,931 --> 02:16:02,110
And I was only,
you know,

2978
02:16:02,250 --> 02:16:05,520
21 and I was seeing like where her path 
was,

2979
02:16:05,710 --> 02:16:09,840
where my path was and like I didn't even
want to have sex with her because of it.

2980
02:16:10,540 --> 02:16:11,373
It was so heavy because you knew that 
she was trapped in this like weird land 

2981
02:16:14,790 --> 02:16:16,570
and if you had sex with her,
you know,

2982
02:16:16,590 --> 02:16:18,600
some turnaround with her.
RigHt?

2983
02:16:18,670 --> 02:16:20,660
Or I would get her out,
I was just like,

2984
02:16:21,180 --> 02:16:23,580
the whole thing to me was like so 
bonkers.

2985
02:16:24,050 --> 02:16:24,883
So like she was describing her life and 
all the different winter or family that 

2986
02:16:28,471 --> 02:16:29,830
were abusive and

2987
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:31,780
all this craziness.
I was like,

2988
02:16:31,810 --> 02:16:33,820
oh my god,
this is so heavy.

2989
02:16:34,380 --> 02:16:37,780
And I realized if you just buy an 
unfortunate roll,

2990
02:16:37,781 --> 02:16:38,614
the dice were literally shat out of your
mom's vagina in the forest and there's 

2991
02:16:44,051 --> 02:16:48,670
some weird bar that everybody in this 
forest town gravitates to.

2992
02:16:48,671 --> 02:16:51,640
And then some industrious person from 
boston decides,

2993
02:16:51,641 --> 02:16:52,474
well,
we're going to book that bar and we 

2994
02:16:53,681 --> 02:16:54,514
would drive up to those places,
meet these poor poor people that were 

2995
02:16:57,630 --> 02:16:59,590
trapped there.
Some of them are cool as fuck.

2996
02:17:00,040 --> 02:17:02,690
Some of them are really cool.
Some of them have Great family.

2997
02:17:02,691 --> 02:17:04,250
Some of them love it up there.
Yeah,

2998
02:17:04,330 --> 02:17:06,810
but not this girl.
This girl was.

2999
02:17:07,180 --> 02:17:09,030
I'll never forget like her just.
Well,

3000
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:09,873
especially at that age.
Imagine like being a girl in that 

3001
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:14,220
situation where it's just like these 
animals,

3002
02:17:14,290 --> 02:17:19,290
one of these guys in this pack is going 
to be the one or some new dude just came

3003
02:17:22,121 --> 02:17:26,260
out of town from out of town and tell 
jokes at least now with social media,

3004
02:17:26,261 --> 02:17:27,094
you see that there's options out there,
like you see other people living lives 

3005
02:17:30,311 --> 02:17:34,810
in different places so you can at least 
you're aware that there's another.

3006
02:17:35,010 --> 02:17:35,843
There's somewhere I could go.
well also you are also aware that 

3007
02:17:38,381 --> 02:17:39,214
there's other communities where you 
could probably thrive and you can make 

3008
02:17:41,741 --> 02:17:45,610
friends online and you can get really 
find out where's a good place to live.

3009
02:17:45,640 --> 02:17:48,760
You can get a job online.
you could save up your money.

3010
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:50,680
You can go somewhere and you can get out
of there.

3011
02:17:51,460 --> 02:17:52,293
This is what I was thinking.
Don't you remember that there were kids 

3012
02:17:55,391 --> 02:17:59,020
like working places all the time when 
you were growing up?

3013
02:17:59,140 --> 02:17:59,973
Oh yeah.
From the time I was like 14 kids were 

3014
02:18:01,390 --> 02:18:02,590
working.
You would like you.

3015
02:18:02,650 --> 02:18:06,040
There'd be kids working at the diner.
They're big kids work at the pizza place

3016
02:18:06,041 --> 02:18:08,140
at the ice cream shop.
At the gas station,

3017
02:18:08,560 --> 02:18:11,680
you don't see kids working anymore.
It's true.

3018
02:18:12,550 --> 02:18:15,610
What happened is are the jobs just taken
by adults who need them?

3019
02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:16,593
God damn man,
come over here and steal our children's 

3020
02:18:18,650 --> 02:18:19,360
jobs.

3021
02:18:19,360 --> 02:18:20,193
I used to be a good job for children.
Is that just where we grow up that 

3022
02:18:22,571 --> 02:18:24,250
there's no kids working?
Like are they doing it?

3023
02:18:24,270 --> 02:18:25,103
You know,
we live in California is always white 

3024
02:18:25,841 --> 02:18:29,170
people out here,
but I grew up in New Jersey and we were,

3025
02:18:29,171 --> 02:18:31,480
we weren't that far from the city.
See again,

3026
02:18:31,481 --> 02:18:33,310
we're old people talking about young 
people.

3027
02:18:33,340 --> 02:18:34,173
These kids today,
we don't know what we're talking about 

3028
02:18:37,391 --> 02:18:38,224
with high school.
Like they don't fucking know what 

3029
02:18:38,921 --> 02:18:41,050
they're talking about.
We're not judging them.

3030
02:18:41,051 --> 02:18:42,640
It's in their forties.
Talking about high school,

3031
02:18:42,660 --> 02:18:43,493
we're trying to learn,
but there used to be kids working 

3032
02:18:45,161 --> 02:18:46,570
everywhere.
We're speculating now.

3033
02:18:46,750 --> 02:18:47,583
We don't know.
People get upset if you're speculating 

3034
02:18:50,830 --> 02:18:51,663
such that somebody did on twitter.
some comic dude got mad at me because I 

3035
02:18:56,141 --> 02:18:59,890
was talking to gavin about gay people.
We weRe talking about,

3036
02:19:00,440 --> 02:19:01,850
um,
not,

3037
02:19:01,910 --> 02:19:02,380
not even gay.

3038
02:19:02,380 --> 02:19:05,020
People were talking about specific 
incidences that have been in the news,

3039
02:19:05,440 --> 02:19:06,273
like milo yiannopoulos,
having that a thing fall out from under 

3040
02:19:09,671 --> 02:19:12,760
him because he said like it's acceptable
for older man who was essentially saying

3041
02:19:12,761 --> 02:19:16,090
it's acceptable for older men to have 
sex with her 13 year old boy,

3042
02:19:16,091 --> 02:19:19,270
and they were talking about george to 
kai who talked about that as well.

3043
02:19:19,271 --> 02:19:20,104
It Happened to him at a summer camp,
like some older dude had sort of busted 

3044
02:19:24,221 --> 02:19:27,770
moves on him and ran him off and shit 
and it was pleasurable and he enjoyed it

3045
02:19:27,771 --> 02:19:29,570
and we were talking about like,
wow,

3046
02:19:29,571 --> 02:19:31,340
it's like a.
It's an intense,

3047
02:19:31,341 --> 02:19:32,530
intense subject.
Right.

3048
02:19:32,570 --> 02:19:33,920
Scott got upset that we were talking 
about it.

3049
02:19:33,921 --> 02:19:37,760
Without a gay perspective.
You're not allowed to speak about it.

3050
02:19:38,450 --> 02:19:39,283
Figure it out.
I think it was attention whoring and 

3051
02:19:40,611 --> 02:19:44,090
maybe he just saw the green light to be 
upset and so he went for it.

3052
02:19:44,170 --> 02:19:46,190
It wasn't right.
Wasn't rash comic.

3053
02:19:46,340 --> 02:19:48,380
Yeah.
Guy branham's of his name,

3054
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:51,620
whatever.
We worked it out online.

3055
02:19:51,621 --> 02:19:54,800
He was friendly afterwards and he 
apologized and I apologized.

3056
02:19:54,950 --> 02:19:55,701
right,
right,

3057
02:19:55,701 --> 02:19:56,534
right.
It was one of those things where it's 

3058
02:19:56,871 --> 02:20:00,230
like people do get,
tend to feel like they're allowed to get

3059
02:20:00,231 --> 02:20:01,064
upset.
You're talking about something that you 

3060
02:20:02,091 --> 02:20:03,890
don't have experienced death.
I know.

3061
02:20:04,010 --> 02:20:06,260
Even if it's something to discuss it,
it's ridiculous,

3062
02:20:06,261 --> 02:20:07,094
right?
You're not allowed to try and figure it 

3063
02:20:08,151 --> 02:20:08,541
out.
Well,

3064
02:20:08,541 --> 02:20:09,374
that's what learning is.
That's what learning is coming from 

3065
02:20:11,181 --> 02:20:12,014
something that you don't know anything 
about and asking questions and having a 

3066
02:20:15,381 --> 02:20:16,214
discussion about it.
THat's when you know something's 

3067
02:20:17,241 --> 02:20:18,074
bullshit.
When you're not allowed to talk about 

3068
02:20:19,071 --> 02:20:19,904
it,
you're not even allowed to talk about 

3069
02:20:20,721 --> 02:20:22,700
it.
You can't discuss even politely,

3070
02:20:23,640 --> 02:20:26,090
respectfully talk about it.
Well then your thing is bullshit.

3071
02:20:26,420 --> 02:20:28,070
You know you have no argument.

3072
02:20:28,070 --> 02:20:29,660
You have no side.
Well,

3073
02:20:29,690 --> 02:20:31,010
there's always this thing,
right,

3074
02:20:31,011 --> 02:20:31,844
and it's.
This is a big thing in certain circles 

3075
02:20:33,711 --> 02:20:36,540
when it comes to disenfranchise people 
or you,

3076
02:20:36,610 --> 02:20:39,050
you hear it when it comes to gender and 
sex.

3077
02:20:39,290 --> 02:20:40,220
You hear it like,
you know,

3078
02:20:40,221 --> 02:20:44,660
you should like one of the wonderful 
things that male feminists love to say.

3079
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:47,270
I'd love to say,
just shut up and listen to the women.

3080
02:20:47,510 --> 02:20:49,430
You need to shut up and listen to women.
Well,

3081
02:20:49,431 --> 02:20:51,920
that's crazy.
You never shut up because even if you're

3082
02:20:51,921 --> 02:20:52,754
being respectful,
someone says something and you would 

3083
02:20:54,260 --> 02:20:56,300
like them to clarify or are you 
confused?

3084
02:20:56,480 --> 02:20:57,313
Or maybe you have some information that 
may they might not be aware of that 

3085
02:20:59,451 --> 02:21:00,284
might change their thoughts on things 
like being engaged in the conversation 

3086
02:21:03,591 --> 02:21:06,920
with someone is not necessarily a 
negative thing,

3087
02:21:06,921 --> 02:21:09,740
but everyone is assuming that if you're 
not a girl,

3088
02:21:09,800 --> 02:21:11,180
you shouldn't talk about girl issues.

3089
02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:13,660
You shouldn't hAve any perspective.
Yeah.

3090
02:21:13,670 --> 02:21:15,470
If you're not a part of the world of 
girl,

3091
02:21:15,471 --> 02:21:17,360
if you're not a guy,
if you're gay,

3092
02:21:17,361 --> 02:21:18,690
if you're not straight,
if you're not,

3093
02:21:18,980 --> 02:21:21,260
you shouldn't talk about it.
So what you're saying when you're asking

3094
02:21:21,261 --> 02:21:23,440
people not to talk about is you're 
saying it.

3095
02:21:23,470 --> 02:21:25,340
It'd be better if this whole,
that whole,

3096
02:21:25,370 --> 02:21:26,203
your whole part of the population stays 
ignorant of what's going on and we just 

3097
02:21:29,241 --> 02:21:31,130
listened and we just stay where.
Listen,

3098
02:21:31,190 --> 02:21:32,290
I'll tell you.
Right.

3099
02:21:32,330 --> 02:21:33,920
You just listen.
I'll tell you.

3100
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:36,590
That's crazy.
That's completely insaNe.

3101
02:21:36,620 --> 02:21:37,453
Well,
it's a power thing is what it is and 

3102
02:21:38,811 --> 02:21:41,330
when certain things developed too much 
social clout,

3103
02:21:41,390 --> 02:21:44,840
when subjects hit hit this critical mass
of social clout,

3104
02:21:44,970 --> 02:21:47,450
but like when the whole bruce jenner 
thing was going on,

3105
02:21:47,451 --> 02:21:48,284
when you had to say that she was 
beautiful and you had to say that you 

3106
02:21:49,671 --> 02:21:51,250
accepted it,
you had to say it was amazing.

3107
02:21:52,040 --> 02:21:53,820
Wasn't she?
Just a fucking kardashians.

3108
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:56,600
Just a little while ago is a ridiculous,
insane family.

3109
02:21:56,890 --> 02:21:59,090
Wasn't this guy like the dumbest one on 
the show?

3110
02:21:59,120 --> 02:22:00,440
Like right?
What just happened?

3111
02:22:00,500 --> 02:22:01,333
Right?
He's got just push a lady into traffic 

3112
02:22:03,381 --> 02:22:05,430
with his car because he wasn't paying 
attention to kill her.

3113
02:22:05,600 --> 02:22:06,433
If we don't Pay attention to that,
but we pay attention to this whole 

3114
02:22:08,630 --> 02:22:10,910
gender change.
It's going to give.

3115
02:22:10,930 --> 02:22:11,763
It's going to make you give a pass to 
all that other behavior and it'll make 

3116
02:22:14,241 --> 02:22:15,074
you seem like a really progressive and 
open minded person if you say all the 

3117
02:22:18,291 --> 02:22:19,130
right things.
Tom,

3118
02:22:19,131 --> 02:22:20,060
papa,
what's your opinion?

3119
02:22:20,390 --> 02:22:21,650
Well,
let me just say,

3120
02:22:21,651 --> 02:22:24,680
I think she's very brave and she's 
beautiful and a hero,

3121
02:22:24,710 --> 02:22:25,543
but

3122
02:22:26,320 --> 02:22:27,153
the hero hero.
You know what I kept doing with my 

3123
02:22:29,611 --> 02:22:33,040
daughters to a to drive them crazy.
They were living in 14.

3124
02:22:33,060 --> 02:22:36,660
We're watching the oscars.
Anyone that came on was a little chubby,

3125
02:22:36,750 --> 02:22:38,280
male or female.
I would just say,

3126
02:22:38,700 --> 02:22:39,750
oh my god,
look at him.

3127
02:22:39,751 --> 02:22:41,110
He's so brave.
Oh,

3128
02:22:41,460 --> 02:22:42,293
look at her.
She's.

3129
02:22:42,420 --> 02:22:44,060
She's so brave.
My $5.

3130
02:22:44,550 --> 02:22:46,530
That's just a new way to say to you,
your thinks she's fat.

3131
02:22:46,680 --> 02:22:47,513
No,
I think.

3132
02:22:47,580 --> 02:22:48,510
Look at that.
I mean,

3133
02:22:48,540 --> 02:22:53,370
she's wearing that dress on tv dad.
My five year old doesn't give a fuck.

3134
02:22:53,550 --> 02:22:54,690
My five year old,
she will.

3135
02:22:54,691 --> 02:22:56,280
She's six now,
but when she was five,

3136
02:22:56,340 --> 02:22:58,090
she was watching caitlyn jenner,
my youngest.

3137
02:22:58,150 --> 02:23:00,930
She just say she was watching caitlyn 
jenner on tv and she goes,

3138
02:23:01,290 --> 02:23:02,500
daddy,
why does that?

3139
02:23:02,820 --> 02:23:05,170
Well,
dress and makeup like that.

3140
02:23:06,110 --> 02:23:07,790
She's like shaking her head.
She goes,

3141
02:23:07,791 --> 02:23:09,920
why is that man wear dress and makeup 
like that?

3142
02:23:10,220 --> 02:23:11,140
I go,
I don't know.

3143
02:23:11,650 --> 02:23:12,483
That's how he or she identifies as a.
She now she turns from a man into a 

3144
02:23:16,371 --> 02:23:17,204
woman and she just looked at me and she 
just like leaned her head back and 

3145
02:23:19,641 --> 02:23:23,030
raised her eyebrows.
She walked away,

3146
02:23:23,350 --> 02:23:24,111
I was like,
dead kid,

3147
02:23:24,111 --> 02:23:26,750
just she left the room.
She just left the road.

3148
02:23:26,751 --> 02:23:27,471
She's like,
bitch,

3149
02:23:27,471 --> 02:23:28,910
please,
without saying it.

3150
02:23:29,120 --> 02:23:29,841
She said,
bitch,

3151
02:23:29,841 --> 02:23:32,450
please.
She pulled her chin closer to our chest,

3152
02:23:32,870 --> 02:23:36,170
lifted her eyebrows up the fuck outta 
here.

3153
02:23:36,380 --> 02:23:39,680
You just told me that that man turned 
Into a woman.

3154
02:23:39,681 --> 02:23:40,520
I know.
It's a man.

3155
02:23:40,521 --> 02:23:41,960
I'm looking at her.
It's a man.

3156
02:23:42,260 --> 02:23:43,640
Daddy,
daddy,

3157
02:23:43,670 --> 02:23:47,780
why does a man have a dress on him?
He got and I was like,

3158
02:23:47,781 --> 02:23:49,040
well,
she used to be a man,

3159
02:23:49,041 --> 02:23:50,050
but she became a woman.

3160
02:23:50,190 --> 02:23:51,023
I liked her.
Walking out of the room is kind of 

3161
02:23:51,901 --> 02:23:54,390
blaming you too.
like all you adults that are a mess.

3162
02:23:54,930 --> 02:23:57,300
You are retarded.
That can't even happen.

3163
02:23:57,320 --> 02:24:00,120
I'm six and I know it can't happen or 
five time,

3164
02:24:00,330 --> 02:24:01,800
daddy.
I'm not stupid.

3165
02:24:02,340 --> 02:24:03,300
I'm stupid.
Okay.

3166
02:24:03,360 --> 02:24:05,180
Yeah.
This is some santa claus bullshit.

3167
02:24:05,190 --> 02:24:06,023
You're fucking running by me.
I'm supposed to think the tooth fairy 

3168
02:24:08,131 --> 02:24:10,740
comes,
sneaks under money under my seat.

3169
02:24:11,730 --> 02:24:14,100
The Whole thing is.
This is so funny.

3170
02:24:14,101 --> 02:24:16,560
I mean that,
that is a big part of what the,

3171
02:24:17,070 --> 02:24:18,810
uh,
election was about.

3172
02:24:19,740 --> 02:24:24,740
Talking you making a say in things or 
just letting things be real well,

3173
02:24:25,351 --> 02:24:28,080
it goes in cycles.
We go one way and we go the other way.

3174
02:24:28,140 --> 02:24:28,973
That's what it is.
It's just like we got tired of people 

3175
02:24:30,571 --> 02:24:32,250
going so hard politically.
Correct,

3176
02:24:32,251 --> 02:24:35,850
but you see how there's progress now.
Like we were talking about school.

3177
02:24:35,880 --> 02:24:36,780
Yeah,
exactly.

3178
02:24:36,781 --> 02:24:39,060
I mean you can't.
I mean that's good.

3179
02:24:39,061 --> 02:24:39,894
People would walk into our schools,
kids will walk up to other kids that 

3180
02:24:43,111 --> 02:24:43,944
were kind of slow.
What are you retarded like right to 

3181
02:24:46,111 --> 02:24:47,250
their face.
Look at him.

3182
02:24:47,260 --> 02:24:48,810
He was a sped.
He's retarded.

3183
02:24:49,260 --> 02:24:51,930
That doesn't exist anymore and I think 
it still exists.

3184
02:24:51,931 --> 02:24:55,560
It just exists less and not when your 
kids go to school in comparison to where

3185
02:24:55,561 --> 02:24:56,394
you go to school,
I mean a bit of a unified and you're 

3186
02:24:58,260 --> 02:25:01,380
hanging out in compton.
I bet you see some bad shit in school.

3187
02:25:02,850 --> 02:25:03,683
Probably.
This is probably some bad shit's still 

3188
02:25:04,981 --> 02:25:05,814
going on in a lot of schools.
A lot of kids are getting bullied and 

3189
02:25:08,161 --> 02:25:10,080
people understand the consequences of 
that now.

3190
02:25:10,081 --> 02:25:12,830
like you're scared to go to class cause 
someone's gonna hit you,

3191
02:25:12,890 --> 02:25:14,670
scared to go to class.
Someone's beat new.

3192
02:25:14,820 --> 02:25:17,550
But bullying was just part of life,
wasn't bullying,

3193
02:25:17,551 --> 02:25:18,384
it was just life back then,
but it wasn't bullying and it did ruin 

3194
02:25:20,371 --> 02:25:22,290
people's lives did,
but nobody called it out.

3195
02:25:22,291 --> 02:25:24,170
No adult would you out with it?
No,

3196
02:25:24,260 --> 02:25:25,093
it's just the way it went.
You have to learn how to take care of 

3197
02:25:26,471 --> 02:25:29,290
shit and everyone was being bullied by 
somebody else.

3198
02:25:29,291 --> 02:25:30,880
It was a.
It was dog eat dog.

3199
02:25:30,910 --> 02:25:33,110
It was,
you know,

3200
02:25:33,720 --> 02:25:35,770
I don't know.
I think that you're right.

3201
02:25:35,771 --> 02:25:36,604
I mean the politically correct thing.
There's swings that way and you're left 

3202
02:25:40,151 --> 02:25:40,984
with some good stuff and everybody 
adjusted and then it goes too far and 

3203
02:25:43,331 --> 02:25:44,164
you start to go after things that don't 
affect a lot of people and then people 

3204
02:25:47,321 --> 02:25:48,730
get fed up by.
well those.

3205
02:25:48,731 --> 02:25:49,564
The thing is those people that goes too 
far that go too far with all that 

3206
02:25:52,361 --> 02:25:53,380
politically correct stuff,

3207
02:25:53,400 --> 02:25:54,233
right?
They're almost always emotionally 

3208
02:25:55,581 --> 02:25:56,414
unbalanced,
so given enough time they will reveal 

3209
02:25:59,691 --> 02:26:04,691
themselves to be either crazy or power 
hungry or like really like a big part of

3210
02:26:08,241 --> 02:26:12,350
that whole social justice warrior 
movement is really about shaming people,

3211
02:26:12,740 --> 02:26:15,560
like expressing anger,
attacking people,

3212
02:26:15,770 --> 02:26:18,800
gaining power,
punching people that disagree with you,

3213
02:26:18,980 --> 02:26:20,630
like punch,
fascist punch,

3214
02:26:20,690 --> 02:26:24,330
punch nazis like being aggressive about 
it and that somehow or another,

3215
02:26:24,331 --> 02:26:25,164
this is a good thing as if because 
they're so delusional and so detached 

3216
02:26:27,891 --> 02:26:31,260
from real physical violence that they 
have this idea that you just going to go

3217
02:26:31,261 --> 02:26:32,990
out there and push these people and take
it back.

3218
02:26:33,110 --> 02:26:34,490
No,
They're gonna show up with guns.

3219
02:26:34,491 --> 02:26:37,970
You fuck like this is how wars get 
started to escalate.

3220
02:26:37,971 --> 02:26:39,620
You try to control people.
You pushed too far.

3221
02:26:39,621 --> 02:26:42,440
You're not kind.
Instead you're shaming people.

3222
02:26:42,441 --> 02:26:44,780
You're creating bad feelings and 
aggression,

3223
02:26:44,960 --> 02:26:48,560
like they've got this juvenile idea 
about confrontation,

3224
02:26:48,890 --> 02:26:51,260
that it just goes out there and it never
comes back to you.

3225
02:26:51,320 --> 02:26:52,730
It always comes back.
Good luck.

3226
02:26:52,820 --> 02:26:54,500
Yeah,
it comes back.

3227
02:26:54,560 --> 02:26:55,250
It comes back.

3228
02:26:55,250 --> 02:26:56,820
Yeah.
Now it's.

3229
02:26:57,100 --> 02:26:57,933
It's people are.
I think striving for kindness is a good 

3230
02:27:02,661 --> 02:27:06,140
thing.
I really think that trying to be nice to

3231
02:27:06,170 --> 02:27:08,390
people.
There's nothing wrong with that.

3232
02:27:08,450 --> 02:27:09,283
No,
but then if you're trying to be so nice 

3233
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:16,070
that now you're the aggressor,
you've gone over the side of the cliff

3234
02:27:16,200 --> 02:27:19,080
100 percent and that's what happens when
people do that.

3235
02:27:19,220 --> 02:27:20,053
So far left.
They go around the fucking equator and 

3236
02:27:22,350 --> 02:27:24,510
they wind up on the right.
I mean,

3237
02:27:24,530 --> 02:27:25,830
right?
It just happens.

3238
02:27:25,860 --> 02:27:28,380
You become a fascist to fight off the 
fascists,

3239
02:27:29,020 --> 02:27:29,853
so it happens round and round.
They go and the people that are 

3240
02:27:33,060 --> 02:27:33,893
effective with it,
one of the things that's happening is 

3241
02:27:36,211 --> 02:27:38,880
they outdo each other.
They feed off of each other,

3242
02:27:38,881 --> 02:27:39,714
they play to each other.
They're playing to the room and they 

3243
02:27:42,451 --> 02:27:43,284
ramp it up so they know that there's 
other people that agree with them and 

3244
02:27:45,321 --> 02:27:47,970
then they see how far they can take it 
and the further you could tell you like,

3245
02:27:47,971 --> 02:27:49,920
oh my god,
mike is so hardcore.

3246
02:27:50,130 --> 02:27:53,310
Holly's not as hardcore as paul.
Paul's out there struggling.

3247
02:27:53,311 --> 02:27:55,950
He's in Guatemala right noW.
You know what I mean?

3248
02:27:55,951 --> 02:27:56,784
It's like they.
They Pushed so hard like this social 

3249
02:27:59,551 --> 02:28:03,000
justice front that they're doing it for 
each other and imPressing each Other and

3250
02:28:03,001 --> 02:28:03,834
impressing these communities of people 
that get together and then somewhere 

3251
02:28:05,881 --> 02:28:09,060
along the line they forget how cruel 
there being two people who disagree with

3252
02:28:09,061 --> 02:28:09,720
them.
Yeah,

3253
02:28:09,720 --> 02:28:10,553
they're being vicious and nasty and uh,
trying to shame people and write blogs 

3254
02:28:13,081 --> 02:28:13,914
about them and attack them and videos 
and they do not realize that while 

3255
02:28:16,411 --> 02:28:19,950
they're doing this,
they're just setting a process in motion

3256
02:28:19,951 --> 02:28:22,040
that is unavoidable.
You putting out

3257
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:25,340
negative and it'S going to come back and
you will not only that,

3258
02:28:25,341 --> 02:28:28,100
you're going to feel personally the 
effects of all that stuff.

3259
02:28:28,450 --> 02:28:31,220
Like when you're shitting on people,
you ruined someone's life with some hate

3260
02:28:31,221 --> 02:28:32,054
blog or something like that.
And tHen that person attacks you and 

3261
02:28:33,830 --> 02:28:34,880
toxic.
Yeah.

3262
02:28:34,881 --> 02:28:36,500
And people are gonna know that you did 
that.

3263
02:28:36,501 --> 02:28:38,330
So they're going to want to come back to
you.

3264
02:28:38,850 --> 02:28:39,683
They're going to feel that you put 
something out there so they're going to 

3265
02:28:41,121 --> 02:28:43,230
root for something.
Come back your way or oh,

3266
02:28:43,370 --> 02:28:45,080
I don't know how people survive that 
way.

3267
02:28:45,480 --> 02:28:46,313
I really game.
That's their game because they don't 

3268
02:28:47,601 --> 02:28:50,440
have a real physical conflict.
Conflict comes.

3269
02:28:50,450 --> 02:28:51,283
Then they probably came from families 
where they like to fight a lot and it 

3270
02:28:54,201 --> 02:28:55,034
was like they're kind of built for that.
There's no sensitivity to get 

3271
02:29:00,880 --> 02:29:01,920
programmed.
Yeah,

3272
02:29:02,500 --> 02:29:04,190
it's a strange existence.

3273
02:29:04,310 --> 02:29:05,143
Well,
we've all been in arguments before and 

3274
02:29:06,141 --> 02:29:06,974
we've all had that feeling after.
It's over that gross feeling of the 

3275
02:29:09,141 --> 02:29:10,190
conflict,
feeling like,

3276
02:29:10,710 --> 02:29:12,410
oh,
I hate this.

3277
02:29:12,411 --> 02:29:14,060
Like how did I get sucked into this 
again?

3278
02:29:14,061 --> 02:29:15,980
Like what did I do?
Like why did I react like that?

3279
02:29:15,981 --> 02:29:16,814
Like why am I here?
And there's people that have that 

3280
02:29:19,101 --> 02:29:22,310
feeling and they're constantly trying to
avoid those situations,

3281
02:29:22,311 --> 02:29:25,190
but they still come up occasionally and 
then they feel even woRse when they come

3282
02:29:25,191 --> 02:29:26,270
up.
For me,

3283
02:29:26,540 --> 02:29:31,540
conflict today feels so much worse than 
conflict felt like 10 or 15 or 20 years.

3284
02:29:32,331 --> 02:29:33,470
Have you personally?
Yes.

3285
02:29:33,650 --> 02:29:37,220
When I'm involved in conflict,
I'm so much more sensitive to how people

3286
02:29:37,221 --> 02:29:39,950
feel than I used to be.
Twenty years ago.

3287
02:29:40,250 --> 02:29:45,090
If I was in an altercation with someone,
I would like to go fuck yourself by.

3288
02:29:45,140 --> 02:29:47,240
Really.
I'd walk away like it was nothing really

3289
02:29:47,241 --> 02:29:49,820
think twice and then as I got older I'd 
always think like,

3290
02:29:49,821 --> 02:29:51,410
how am I coming off to that person?

3291
02:29:51,410 --> 02:29:52,243
Like maybe I could've handled it better.
Like maybe tHe communication if I was 

3292
02:29:55,341 --> 02:29:57,380
just more calm initially they would have
been more calm.

3293
02:29:57,410 --> 02:29:58,880
We could have laughed it off,
you know,

3294
02:29:58,940 --> 02:29:59,773
like a kid in the pool hall.
But the kid in the pool hall was not a 

3295
02:30:02,511 --> 02:30:04,790
threat and he was a young kid and I saw 
and I was like,

3296
02:30:04,791 --> 02:30:07,100
what are you doing?
You're going to get hurt.

3297
02:30:07,130 --> 02:30:07,963
Like,
don't do that.

3298
02:30:08,420 --> 02:30:09,740
But this,
this,

3299
02:30:09,741 --> 02:30:11,130
um,
as I get older,

3300
02:30:11,131 --> 02:30:14,720
I.
This is revelation that a lot of what we

3301
02:30:14,721 --> 02:30:15,554
get into a lot of these confrontations 
and arguments and disputes and a lot of 

3302
02:30:18,621 --> 02:30:23,300
negativity is avoidable.
Like it's not worth,

3303
02:30:23,720 --> 02:30:25,700
it's not worth the attack.
No,

3304
02:30:25,880 --> 02:30:26,740
it's not.
It's a.

3305
02:30:27,500 --> 02:30:30,290
I always felt that way,
that it's a little more zen.

3306
02:30:30,291 --> 02:30:33,620
Like to let it go with it.
And uh,

3307
02:30:34,250 --> 02:30:35,083
and then,
um,

3308
02:30:35,120 --> 02:30:36,770
my buddy was saying,
no,

3309
02:30:36,771 --> 02:30:38,210
you're more like codependent.

3310
02:30:38,770 --> 02:30:42,390
You are like,
you are a,

3311
02:30:42,920 --> 02:30:43,753
you're trying to make other people happy
to a point where it's a negative for 

3312
02:30:47,661 --> 02:30:48,494
you.
Yeah,

3313
02:30:49,150 --> 02:30:49,983
yeah,
yeah.

3314
02:30:50,010 --> 02:30:50,843
Know what I mean?
Like when you were talking about you 

3315
02:30:51,711 --> 02:30:54,500
being 20 and just being like,
go fuck yourself.

3316
02:30:54,550 --> 02:30:59,540
It's like I never had that and I always,
I was always a little envious of that.

3317
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:00,433
I had too much of it like being on the 
road and somebody cuts you off and it's 

3318
02:31:02,871 --> 02:31:04,640
just like you feel so bad and you're 
like,

3319
02:31:04,641 --> 02:31:08,630
if someone gives you the finger,
it's like I carry that with me all day.

3320
02:31:08,660 --> 02:31:12,260
It's such an upsetting integrate set.
I would still get me wrong.

3321
02:31:12,261 --> 02:31:14,320
I was totally upset all day.
Yeah.

3322
02:31:14,330 --> 02:31:16,180
But I wouldn't feel bad.
Right.

3323
02:31:16,360 --> 02:31:19,790
I'd be like that fucking piece of shit.
Like what I would that.

3324
02:31:19,880 --> 02:31:20,590
Yeah.
Yeah.

3325
02:31:20,590 --> 02:31:22,130
I wouldn't feel bad that like,
ah,

3326
02:31:22,160 --> 02:31:23,610
I could avoid that confrontation.

3327
02:31:23,670 --> 02:31:24,503
Right.
It wouldn't feel that I'd have a stupid 

3328
02:31:25,771 --> 02:31:26,604
way of looking at it where instead of 
like being philosophical about my own 

3329
02:31:29,551 --> 02:31:30,384
role in having this take place in my own
inability to manage the communication 

3330
02:31:36,380 --> 02:31:37,171
header.
Yeah.

3331
02:31:37,171 --> 02:31:39,930
How To handle it.
It's like everything else,

3332
02:31:39,931 --> 02:31:42,000
like you get better at catching balls,
you know,

3333
02:31:42,001 --> 02:31:44,310
like some dudes are way better at 
catching a baseball than you.

3334
02:31:44,400 --> 02:31:45,233
RigHt.
And if you go out and try to catch that 

3335
02:31:46,531 --> 02:31:48,030
baseball,
you couldn't be caught.

3336
02:31:48,060 --> 02:31:48,893
it was out of my hands,
but meanwhile someone who's way better 

3337
02:31:50,971 --> 02:31:53,300
at it but just snatch it out of the sky 
and be like,

3338
02:31:53,301 --> 02:31:54,840
I got this easy,
easy out.

3339
02:31:55,200 --> 02:31:55,980
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

3340
02:31:55,980 --> 02:31:59,400
It's essentially the same thing when 
you're communicating with people.

3341
02:31:59,401 --> 02:32:01,890
If you're,
if you're not good at communicating,

3342
02:32:02,040 --> 02:32:05,700
you have these awkward moments and you 
are as much responsible for someone else

3343
02:32:06,030 --> 02:32:08,280
getting paid even if they did something 
wrong,

3344
02:32:08,750 --> 02:32:13,440
like you're as much as responsible for 
it going bad as they are in a way.

3345
02:32:13,470 --> 02:32:14,303
IT's a difficult thing because you can 
sometimes be very aware of it and very 

3346
02:32:18,181 --> 02:32:21,570
sensitive to people and try and make 
everything cool.

3347
02:32:21,571 --> 02:32:24,280
And then somebody says something or does
something and you're,

3348
02:32:24,510 --> 02:32:26,760
there's something inside us that just 
flares.

3349
02:32:27,330 --> 02:32:29,690
It just like specially with booze.
Yeah,

3350
02:32:29,691 --> 02:32:31,110
yeah.
it's just like,

3351
02:32:31,111 --> 02:32:33,640
no,
you know,

3352
02:32:34,040 --> 02:32:36,510
you know,
and it catches you by surprise.

3353
02:32:36,511 --> 02:32:37,560
It's like,
yeah,

3354
02:32:37,561 --> 02:32:39,420
and then,
but the problem is when it catches me by

3355
02:32:39,421 --> 02:32:40,470
surprise,
I'm always like,

3356
02:32:40,500 --> 02:32:41,333
oh my god,
my mouth is moving faster than my brain 

3357
02:32:42,511 --> 02:32:43,344
here.
I'm just saying aggressive things and I 

3358
02:32:44,821 --> 02:32:45,430
don't.
I'm not.

3359
02:32:45,430 --> 02:32:49,080
Haven't thought this through like that.
People do do that and then you're like,

3360
02:32:49,081 --> 02:32:50,640
oh shit.
Better be poised for violence.

3361
02:32:50,760 --> 02:32:51,593
So you're look like your brain's on.
Then the communication skills are even 

3362
02:32:54,541 --> 02:32:56,700
worse because I'm not really thinking 
about communicating.

3363
02:32:56,701 --> 02:33:00,300
I'm thinking if I feel like you're 
moving in my direction too quickly,

3364
02:33:00,880 --> 02:33:02,830
I'm going to act right now.

3365
02:33:02,990 --> 02:33:04,440
So we're,
we're in this stage.

3366
02:33:04,470 --> 02:33:06,570
Do you?
Because I was.

3367
02:33:07,140 --> 02:33:07,973
Do you have,
because you know violence or you know 

3368
02:33:10,860 --> 02:33:13,710
fighting,
you have been trained in it.

3369
02:33:14,100 --> 02:33:16,380
You know it.
You've lived aspect of it.

3370
02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:21,750
Does it put you more on alert physically
when you're out in the world?

3371
02:33:21,780 --> 02:33:24,270
I've seen people get punched.
I've seen people geT punched with.

3372
02:33:24,271 --> 02:33:25,104
I didn't expect to get punched.
I've seen people get sucker punched and 

3373
02:33:26,641 --> 02:33:28,410
knocked unconscious.
It's fucking terrifying,

3374
02:33:28,440 --> 02:33:30,870
but I'm saying people do do it.
I know the consequences of it.

3375
02:33:30,990 --> 02:33:31,940
Nobody.
so do you.

3376
02:33:31,950 --> 02:33:34,260
When you walk around the street,
are you more,

3377
02:33:34,290 --> 02:33:35,123
are you,
are you looking for violence more than 

3378
02:33:37,550 --> 02:33:39,350
someone that wasn't trained?
Not to,

3379
02:33:39,460 --> 02:33:41,220
not to engage in.
I know what you're saying.

3380
02:33:41,610 --> 02:33:42,220
No,
no.

3381
02:33:42,220 --> 02:33:43,950
You.
Are you aware of it happening?

3382
02:33:44,010 --> 02:33:44,843
I'm definitely.
I definitely try to be aware when 

3383
02:33:46,561 --> 02:33:47,394
there's men and they're drinking when 
whenever there's men and they're 

3384
02:33:49,681 --> 02:33:52,740
drinking or if you're in a poor 
neighborhood like we were talking about,

3385
02:33:52,741 --> 02:33:53,574
you know,
being outside of a resort in Mexico and 

3386
02:33:54,811 --> 02:33:56,640
you see the military and you realize why
it's there.

3387
02:33:57,900 --> 02:33:58,733
I jusT think that for the most part 
you're safe like almost everywhere and 

3388
02:34:02,050 --> 02:34:04,410
it's being a man,
especially if you're a woman,

3389
02:34:04,720 --> 02:34:07,310
be a very different thing because you 
have two things going on yet.

3390
02:34:07,320 --> 02:34:08,153
One,
the majority of the People around you 

3391
02:34:09,151 --> 02:34:09,984
that are men can overpower you and to 
the majority of people that are men 

3392
02:34:13,650 --> 02:34:15,330
might fuck you.
Right.

3393
02:34:15,630 --> 02:34:18,040
You know,
I mean if you're already active woman in

3394
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:20,590
particular and you're walking around,
you have a nice body,

3395
02:34:20,620 --> 02:34:22,940
like you're juSt a god damn asshole 
target.

3396
02:34:22,990 --> 02:34:23,823
It's everywhere you go click.
He put those yoga pants on those 

3397
02:34:27,050 --> 02:34:28,040
lululemon's.
Yeah,

3398
02:34:28,560 --> 02:34:30,830
it was a fuchsia,
oh my god,

3399
02:34:30,890 --> 02:34:31,723
pants.
And you got that big juicy ass and 

3400
02:34:32,741 --> 02:34:36,040
you're walking down the mall,
you're going to get bombed on.

3401
02:34:36,041 --> 02:34:38,890
It's going to happen.
Are you saying when I'd wear it?

3402
02:34:39,570 --> 02:34:40,630
Yeah,
juicy guy.

3403
02:34:40,700 --> 02:34:41,550
But when you're,
you're,

3404
02:34:41,680 --> 02:34:43,380
when you're not in those heightened 
situations,

3405
02:34:43,590 --> 02:34:45,400
you're not thinking no.
right.

3406
02:34:45,430 --> 02:34:49,330
But when people get inflamed,
I get super nervous because it's similar

3407
02:34:49,331 --> 02:34:51,190
to the gun thing.
It's similar to like,

3408
02:34:51,280 --> 02:34:51,970
well,
it is a gun.

3409
02:34:51,970 --> 02:34:52,990
Well,
if you have a gun,

3410
02:34:53,500 --> 02:34:55,990
you're living.
Your reaLity is different.

3411
02:34:56,010 --> 02:34:56,860
Right?
Right.

3412
02:34:57,190 --> 02:34:58,023
Well there's that.
But there's also like when people get 

3413
02:35:00,071 --> 02:35:03,310
upset and you know,
we were talking about things ramping up,

3414
02:35:03,500 --> 02:35:04,333
like the momentum of them gets away from
you and then you're saying things you 

3415
02:35:06,921 --> 02:35:07,780
haven't thought out yet.

3416
02:35:08,170 --> 02:35:09,003
People make actions that they haven't 
thought out yet and you're a reasonable 

3417
02:35:11,051 --> 02:35:11,680
guy.
And um,

3418
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:15,930
I tried to be pretty reasonable and if 
I'm saying this and I'm admitting to the

3419
02:35:15,931 --> 02:35:18,460
emotions can get carried away,
especially when there's danger involved,

3420
02:35:18,760 --> 02:35:21,250
I can get to saying things that I should
have probably never said.

3421
02:35:21,500 --> 02:35:23,370
It just got away from me.
What about an idiot,

3422
02:35:23,890 --> 02:35:26,710
what an idiot who had been abused as a 
child would have been an idiot,

3423
02:35:26,711 --> 02:35:30,850
has been beaten and abused as a child 
and it is almost like feels like they're

3424
02:35:30,860 --> 02:35:31,693
at such a deficit of love and they were 
owed so much violence that they're very 

3425
02:35:35,231 --> 02:35:38,530
caPable of inflicting violence on random
people for no reason.

3426
02:35:38,560 --> 02:35:41,050
It's just how they're programmed.
yeah,

3427
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:44,680
and that goes back to what we're talking
about earlier about real leaders.

3428
02:35:44,681 --> 02:35:47,320
If we had a real leaders in real 
direction in this country,

3429
02:35:47,350 --> 02:35:47,890
we would.

3430
02:35:47,890 --> 02:35:48,723
We would fix the educational system in 
these Bad neighborhoods and spent a ton 

3431
02:35:51,581 --> 02:35:52,414
of money to try to rejuvenate these 
neighborhoods or have some sort of a 

3432
02:35:54,371 --> 02:35:55,204
plan to eliminate crime,
to reduce crime rather to to make it 

3433
02:35:59,930 --> 02:36:00,763
safer.
And you got to start with kids when 

3434
02:36:01,871 --> 02:36:03,040
they're really,
really young.

3435
02:36:03,150 --> 02:36:04,920
Yeah.
I can't wait until they're 16,

3436
02:36:04,940 --> 02:36:07,870
17 and go in and just throw some money 
at it and expect it to.

3437
02:36:07,990 --> 02:36:08,823
You've got to work.
You've got to just dump tons of money 

3438
02:36:10,601 --> 02:36:11,081
into it.
You know,

3439
02:36:11,081 --> 02:36:13,480
the private sector is the thing that's 
do that,

3440
02:36:13,481 --> 02:36:17,510
does that more than more than a couple,
but what they,

3441
02:36:18,040 --> 02:36:18,873
or even the nonprofits like I did this 
gig last night when I was saying with 

3442
02:36:22,511 --> 02:36:26,250
common last night,
it was this group called the group.

3443
02:36:26,320 --> 02:36:27,153
So did You just stand up?
I did stand up and hosted the whole 

3444
02:36:28,721 --> 02:36:32,290
night and uh,
it's all about kids.

3445
02:36:32,290 --> 02:36:35,500
It's in la and it's all about helping 
autistic kids,

3446
02:36:35,501 --> 02:36:38,230
kids with special needs and you just 
watch.

3447
02:36:38,260 --> 02:36:42,460
It's such a nice thing to see all these 
people donating money,

3448
02:36:42,461 --> 02:36:44,590
spending the night to support this 
school,

3449
02:36:44,591 --> 02:36:45,424
that this woman's passion just purely to
help autistic kids survive and find a 

3450
02:36:51,671 --> 02:36:53,330
way in the world.
That's awesome.

3451
02:36:53,331 --> 02:36:54,164
I like those kind of efforts.
When you see like bill gates giving all 

3452
02:36:56,921 --> 02:36:57,754
of his money,
there's sourcing does the opposite of 

3453
02:36:59,660 --> 02:37:00,493
what bill gates,
just trying to find programmers for 

3454
02:37:01,601 --> 02:37:02,434
windows 30,
seen them now and it's like autistic 

3455
02:37:05,411 --> 02:37:07,690
kids,
they fucking wicked programming.

3456
02:37:07,720 --> 02:37:10,840
Just sit in front of a computer breaks,
just give him coffee.

3457
02:37:10,870 --> 02:37:13,600
He calls it a camp,
but it's reallY the back of microsoft.

3458
02:37:15,090 --> 02:37:16,000
Come on,
do I can't

3459
02:37:16,270 --> 02:37:17,103
believe you.
Do you know that ones and zeros can 

3460
02:37:18,291 --> 02:37:20,660
represent computer language.
What does that mean?

3461
02:37:22,130 --> 02:37:23,480
This is interesting.
Show me more.

3462
02:37:23,740 --> 02:37:25,280
So your parents,
you want to live with me?

3463
02:37:25,281 --> 02:37:26,114
Kenny.
You can stay in the place where I keep 

3464
02:37:28,251 --> 02:37:29,090
my submarine.
Wow.

3465
02:37:29,150 --> 02:37:30,410
Interesting.
How does it propelled?

3466
02:37:31,810 --> 02:37:33,470
You could pound when you get them,

3467
02:37:36,020 --> 02:37:38,300
but it really is pretty hopeful when you
see these,

3468
02:37:38,390 --> 02:37:41,120
these private groups with a lot of 
money,

3469
02:37:41,121 --> 02:37:41,954
like pushing it.
Well the government doesn't do it 

3470
02:37:43,581 --> 02:37:44,100
anyway.

3471
02:37:44,100 --> 02:37:45,310
Feeling anYtime.
You know,

3472
02:37:45,311 --> 02:37:47,140
if someone's doing something nice,
that feeling,

3473
02:37:47,560 --> 02:37:48,393
that feeling of oh,
a person's doing a nice thing to see 

3474
02:37:50,411 --> 02:37:54,850
what the pope said about panhandlers and
sweet that you can fuck them.

3475
02:37:54,851 --> 02:37:55,930
Like your four kids,
you know,

3476
02:37:55,931 --> 02:37:59,900
you've read it.
No,

3477
02:38:00,530 --> 02:38:03,130
this,
this pope is antiquing and he's not like

3478
02:38:03,131 --> 02:38:03,810
that last guy.

3479
02:38:03,810 --> 02:38:04,401
No,
he's.

3480
02:38:04,401 --> 02:38:05,990
Yeah,
he's totally not into it.

3481
02:38:06,410 --> 02:38:07,370
No.
What did he said that,

3482
02:38:07,371 --> 02:38:08,061
uh,
he said,

3483
02:38:08,061 --> 02:38:08,894
you know,
in the question of whether you should 

3484
02:38:09,621 --> 02:38:11,310
give or not.
Uh,

3485
02:38:11,530 --> 02:38:13,940
it always comes up and you think,
well,

3486
02:38:13,950 --> 02:38:17,480
what is he going to use?
The money on him is just for drugs or is

3487
02:38:17,481 --> 02:38:18,230
it a,
is it,

3488
02:38:18,230 --> 02:38:20,030
am I doing it just to make myself feel 
better?

3489
02:38:20,031 --> 02:38:20,864
All these kinds of questions come up 
when you pass someone who's asking you 

3490
02:38:23,031 --> 02:38:23,864
for money and he said there's nothing.
There's never anything wrong with 

3491
02:38:26,301 --> 02:38:28,350
giving.
There's,

3492
02:38:28,620 --> 02:38:32,270
there's never anything wrong with giving
to someone who's asking.

3493
02:38:32,330 --> 02:38:35,060
They're asking for some reason as a 
human being,

3494
02:38:35,720 --> 02:38:39,470
it's okay to give,
and I thought that's great,

3495
02:38:40,250 --> 02:38:41,083
and then I thought,
but when he's not taking into 

3496
02:38:42,061 --> 02:38:44,480
consideration is,
but then what about the guy?

3497
02:38:44,600 --> 02:38:48,650
Then you walk a block and there's 
another guy and another guy,

3498
02:38:49,300 --> 02:38:51,230
you run out of money,
you run out of money,

3499
02:38:51,350 --> 02:38:52,183
or you vaden decide,
now I gave to that guy and you're still 

3500
02:38:54,711 --> 02:38:56,390
in that space of,
no,

3501
02:38:56,391 --> 02:38:57,224
I'm a good person,
but you still have to go through all 

3502
02:38:58,671 --> 02:38:59,540
that stuff in your head.

3503
02:38:59,750 --> 02:39:00,680
good point,
right?

3504
02:39:00,740 --> 02:39:01,760
Yeah.
When did you decide?

3505
02:39:01,790 --> 02:39:03,290
Yeah.
at what point does it stop?

3506
02:39:03,291 --> 02:39:04,124
I'm good enough.
He got the pope has never been to santa 

3507
02:39:06,051 --> 02:39:07,400
monIca.
Oh,

3508
02:39:07,401 --> 02:39:08,700
that's right.
You know what I mean?

3509
02:39:08,701 --> 02:39:09,970
It's right.
One after the other.

3510
02:39:09,990 --> 02:39:12,050
Those homeless dudes backpacks.
Yeah.

3511
02:39:12,090 --> 02:39:15,200
Dogs.
Almost dudes with dogs are the weirdest.

3512
02:39:15,201 --> 02:39:17,820
Like you are not winning anything.
You fuck?

3513
02:39:18,520 --> 02:39:20,420
How are you feeding your dog?
Never roof.

3514
02:39:20,450 --> 02:39:22,400
It's so shitty.
It's totally shitty,

3515
02:39:22,870 --> 02:39:24,650
but it's also broken people.
It's like,

3516
02:39:24,680 --> 02:39:26,990
well,
who raised that guy will a guaranteed.

3517
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:27,833
It wasn't some really awesome dad like 
tom papa and some really nice 

3518
02:39:30,861 --> 02:39:31,694
neighborhood and everybody loved them 
and there's a lot of family and friends 

3519
02:39:34,221 --> 02:39:37,400
around and know our times.
Hard tImes.

3520
02:39:37,401 --> 02:39:39,380
My heart fucked up times.
Yeah,

3521
02:39:39,800 --> 02:39:42,470
it's hard being a person even if you're 
just normal,

3522
02:39:42,560 --> 02:39:45,320
if you're just.
It's hard to keep it together.

3523
02:39:45,380 --> 02:39:46,220
It is,
man.

3524
02:39:46,280 --> 02:39:48,200
It's hard fOr everybody.
For all of us,

3525
02:39:48,201 --> 02:39:49,034
and it's hard for a bunch of reasons and
one of the biggest reasons is that the 

3526
02:39:51,621 --> 02:39:55,190
reality of being a human being does not 
make sense.

3527
02:39:55,550 --> 02:39:56,960
It just doesn't.
Right?

3528
02:39:57,620 --> 02:39:58,850
Well,
you need a job to do.

3529
02:39:58,851 --> 02:40:01,400
You gotta keep yourself busy.
That's the only way.

3530
02:40:02,780 --> 02:40:04,190
Otherwise you start thinking,
oh,

3531
02:40:04,191 --> 02:40:07,670
here I am clinging to this balls.
It hurdles through infinity,

3532
02:40:08,060 --> 02:40:09,350
right?
You got to bring them up.

3533
02:40:09,351 --> 02:40:10,184
The news,
when I remember like when your kids 

3534
02:40:11,811 --> 02:40:14,490
first show up,
some of first things toys

3535
02:40:14,940 --> 02:40:15,773
are like kitchen sets and and work 
benches and [inaudible] and they just 

3536
02:40:19,801 --> 02:40:20,634
gravitate to it and want to do a project
and they make together fake breakfast 

3537
02:40:23,971 --> 02:40:26,880
and bring it over to you and give it to 
you.

3538
02:40:27,090 --> 02:40:29,850
They want to be busy.
You want your head to do something.

3539
02:40:29,851 --> 02:40:33,360
You have to feed your brain some 
activity.

3540
02:40:34,350 --> 02:40:36,840
You really do tv,
no dangerous.

3541
02:40:36,870 --> 02:40:38,520
It doesn't have to be something big 
either.

3542
02:40:38,580 --> 02:40:42,810
It could be something small,
just be into something and that's why tv

3543
02:40:42,820 --> 02:40:43,653
so dangerous because you can live your 
whole life without ever developing any 

3544
02:40:45,631 --> 02:40:46,464
interest.
That's right.

3545
02:40:46,710 --> 02:40:49,380
Going from show to show to show and your
mind is now occupiEd,

3546
02:40:49,890 --> 02:40:53,190
occupied on some other actions,
extraneous actions.

3547
02:40:53,191 --> 02:40:55,200
They're not even in your immediate 
vicinity.

3548
02:40:55,230 --> 02:40:56,063
It's a positive thing.
When people ask me if I've seen this 

3549
02:40:59,581 --> 02:41:03,090
show,
I don't know what we just binge it.

3550
02:41:03,091 --> 02:41:05,580
you've got the more shows.

3551
02:41:05,580 --> 02:41:06,413
I say,
I haven't seen it means I'm doing 

3552
02:41:08,011 --> 02:41:11,070
something right.
one show.

3553
02:41:11,340 --> 02:41:12,720
do you have a role?
Ira?

3554
02:41:12,770 --> 02:41:15,100
Allow myself one show that I'm watching.
Oh,

3555
02:41:15,110 --> 02:41:15,943
that's a good,
that's a good role right now it's house 

3556
02:41:17,341 --> 02:41:18,174
of cards,
which is great because I just got into 

3557
02:41:19,351 --> 02:41:22,160
it a little bit ago.
I'm only on season three and it was like

3558
02:41:22,200 --> 02:41:24,000
two whole seasons to watch.
Right.

3559
02:41:24,330 --> 02:41:25,500
That's good.
That's a good spot.

3560
02:41:25,530 --> 02:41:26,363
Shows good.
So I'm wondering if I watch an hour of 

3561
02:41:29,040 --> 02:41:30,210
tv a night.
That's good.

3562
02:41:30,240 --> 02:41:31,470
That's a lot.
That's plenty.

3563
02:41:31,570 --> 02:41:33,510
That's a lot.
I uh,

3564
02:41:33,511 --> 02:41:34,530
yeah.
I can't,

3565
02:41:34,590 --> 02:41:37,440
you should be doing something else.
I need to do more shit though,

3566
02:41:38,070 --> 02:41:40,290
you know,
but I'm feeling right now.

3567
02:41:40,291 --> 02:41:41,730
I need to do something new.
Oh yeah,

3568
02:41:41,860 --> 02:41:43,160
I am.
I'm like,

3569
02:41:43,161 --> 02:41:44,070
I'm,
I don't know.

3570
02:41:44,071 --> 02:41:44,904
I'm not,
I don't feel like I'm stagnant because 

3571
02:41:45,751 --> 02:41:46,584
I'm constantly in motion.
It's all very positive and I appreciate 

3572
02:41:49,231 --> 02:41:50,064
all the good things that are happening 
and I appreciate all the people that 

3573
02:41:52,290 --> 02:41:55,080
enjoyed the podcast and the comedy shows
and all that stuff.

3574
02:41:55,080 --> 02:41:55,913
But man,
right now I feel like I need to wrap my 

3575
02:41:58,051 --> 02:42:00,480
brain around something fresh and novel.
New.

3576
02:42:00,570 --> 02:42:03,360
Have you ever tried baking bread?
Not interested.

3577
02:42:04,140 --> 02:42:07,100
So what do You need it?
It's what you can give your kids.

3578
02:42:07,880 --> 02:42:12,540
Did my kids shit that I won't even eat 
bread?

3579
02:42:12,541 --> 02:42:13,374
Tastes awesome.
I would,

3580
02:42:13,380 --> 02:42:17,040
I would do bread like once a week.
It isn't maybe a cook bread on sunday.

3581
02:42:17,400 --> 02:42:19,050
It's a great mental.
Uh,

3582
02:42:19,320 --> 02:42:23,520
it is that thing that I found like I was
kind of the same way and it kind of gave

3583
02:42:23,521 --> 02:42:24,960
me.
I'm not saying this to be bright,

3584
02:42:24,961 --> 02:42:29,100
but some kind of thing like that where 
it's something that grounds you.

3585
02:42:29,250 --> 02:42:31,020
I think I'm going to write a book.
Yeah,

3586
02:42:31,050 --> 02:42:33,690
that's a good api.
Gearing up for that over the last couple

3587
02:42:33,690 --> 02:42:34,523
of days.
Thinking I need like some sort of a 

3588
02:42:36,241 --> 02:42:40,080
project to wrap my head around,
other than all the shit that I'm already

3589
02:42:40,081 --> 02:42:42,090
doing.
I'm writing one right now.

3590
02:42:42,270 --> 02:42:43,103
I have a deadline in may.
How many pictures isn't it there better 

3591
02:42:46,441 --> 02:42:49,290
be alive.
I'll read both pictures right now.

3592
02:42:49,800 --> 02:42:54,090
It would have to have a lot of pictures.
That's a photo shoot.

3593
02:42:54,150 --> 02:42:54,983
You and me.

3594
02:42:57,080 --> 02:43:00,570
We're at a podcast.
Why are there 20 pictures of you and joe

3595
02:43:00,571 --> 02:43:03,480
rogan?
We need to fill pages out of my check.

3596
02:43:03,490 --> 02:43:05,640
Please.
Wasn't writing a lot though.

3597
02:43:06,060 --> 02:43:09,480
You said 200 pages,
200 pages.

3598
02:43:09,840 --> 02:43:14,840
Fuck you.
That would be perfect.

3599
02:43:15,820 --> 02:43:18,730
It's a bear to do blogs all the time and
I think it.

3600
02:43:19,090 --> 02:43:20,020
Yeah.
I live very least.

3601
02:43:20,140 --> 02:43:21,990
I'm gonna start writing blogs again 
because I.

3602
02:43:22,060 --> 02:43:23,320
You should do a book.
I don't want.

3603
02:43:23,321 --> 02:43:24,154
I'm not trying to talk you out of it.
I would see it as a fan and a friend 

3604
02:43:27,191 --> 02:43:31,510
would like to be joe rogan bootcamp.
I'm going to lie about everything.

3605
02:43:31,511 --> 02:43:32,344
We make up stories.
I'm going to make journalism book where 

3606
02:43:35,321 --> 02:43:37,810
I'm going to have like some aspects of 
my life and then it'll be like.

3607
02:43:37,930 --> 02:43:40,180
Remember when chuck woolery,
not chuck woolery,

3608
02:43:40,181 --> 02:43:41,014
chuck barris barris.
They did a whole movie about him being 

3609
02:43:42,881 --> 02:43:44,720
an assassin for the government.
He was part of the guy.

3610
02:43:44,770 --> 02:43:47,950
He was the host of the gong show and 
killing people for the cia.

3611
02:43:48,340 --> 02:43:49,173
I'm gonna do that.
I'm going to like have most of real 

3612
02:43:51,311 --> 02:43:52,144
stories of like my childhood intertwined
with like murderers and werewolves and 

3613
02:43:55,451 --> 02:43:59,350
fucking that's a great call it truth or 
not.

3614
02:43:59,620 --> 02:44:00,890
You see this fucking latest shit.

3615
02:44:00,950 --> 02:44:05,950
A wiki leaks saying that the cia has 
access to all of our phones vault.

3616
02:44:06,191 --> 02:44:08,080
Seven leaks today.
Yeah.

3617
02:44:08,380 --> 02:44:11,180
What is looked through it yet?
Pull up a full.

3618
02:44:11,220 --> 02:44:12,053
Because edward snowden was saying that 
it's not whether or not they can access 

3619
02:44:16,360 --> 02:44:19,240
where they have access to your ink 
encrypted shit.

3620
02:44:19,241 --> 02:44:22,120
It's like they've hacked android and 
ios,

3621
02:44:22,470 --> 02:44:25,570
like they get into android and ios.
So if you're some.

3622
02:44:25,930 --> 02:44:26,763
But here's the thing,
they're saying they use it for 

3623
02:44:27,521 --> 02:44:28,430
espionage.
right.

3624
02:44:28,960 --> 02:44:29,793
So like if the russians are here,
they want to find out what they're up 

3625
02:44:31,410 --> 02:44:32,243
to.
You could hack into their phone and get 

3626
02:44:32,741 --> 02:44:34,690
their data.
They are doing it too.

3627
02:44:34,830 --> 02:44:37,660
So like if,
if somehow or another we stopped the cia

3628
02:44:37,661 --> 02:44:38,650
from doing it.
Right.

3629
02:44:38,710 --> 02:44:41,170
Here's the question,
would you want.

3630
02:44:41,171 --> 02:44:44,260
If Russia is doing it in china's doing 
and North Korea and then all of a sudden

3631
02:44:44,261 --> 02:44:48,250
the cia can't do it anymore,
aren't they at a disadvantage?

3632
02:44:48,370 --> 02:44:49,840
Yeah.
Yeah.

3633
02:44:49,990 --> 02:44:50,823
That seems.
That seems like we don't know what the 

3634
02:44:52,451 --> 02:44:53,284
fuck we're doing psa.
This incorrectly implies the cia hack 

3635
02:44:56,201 --> 02:44:57,670
those apps,
these apps,

3636
02:44:57,880 --> 02:44:58,713
ford slash encryption,
but the doc show ils ford slash android 

3637
02:45:01,601 --> 02:45:04,120
or what got hacked,
a much bigger problem,

3638
02:45:04,870 --> 02:45:06,790
so still working through the 
publications,

3639
02:45:06,791 --> 02:45:11,380
but what wikileaks has here is a 
genuinely is genuinely a big deal,

3640
02:45:11,410 --> 02:45:13,330
looks authentic,
see,

3641
02:45:13,331 --> 02:45:14,164
but I just,
I feel like we have to be very careful 

3642
02:45:18,700 --> 02:45:19,533
if other people are doing things right.
So like if you talk to people in the 

3643
02:45:23,411 --> 02:45:25,780
intelligence community,
and I don't talk to a lot of them,

3644
02:45:25,781 --> 02:45:26,614
but I have talked to a few,
well they will tell you is you have to 

3645
02:45:29,051 --> 02:45:29,884
understand that what the majority of the
american public thinks is going on in 

3646
02:45:33,101 --> 02:45:37,900
the world and what their motives are and
what kind of espionage and fucking dirty

3647
02:45:37,901 --> 02:45:42,180
tricks take place.
It's way worse than you think it is your

3648
02:45:42,190 --> 02:45:43,023
way.
Lucky that you're sheltered from all 

3649
02:45:43,781 --> 02:45:47,800
this stuff and they're just,
there's some bad fucking things that are

3650
02:45:47,801 --> 02:45:48,634
going on in the world and one of those 
things is what you're looking at in 

3651
02:45:52,781 --> 02:45:57,190
Russia right now is like an emerging 
superpower run by a dictator.

3652
02:45:57,250 --> 02:45:58,083
Yeah.
And anybody who opposes him winds up 

3653
02:46:00,070 --> 02:46:00,910
dead.
Yeah.

3654
02:46:00,970 --> 02:46:04,350
Have you seen all those fucking russians
that have wound up dead recently?

3655
02:46:04,351 --> 02:46:06,470
They're attached to these leaks.
There.

3656
02:46:06,520 --> 02:46:08,080
Wasn't there?
Like what's the latest count?

3657
02:46:08,110 --> 02:46:10,070
Six yesterday.
I don't know if it.

3658
02:46:10,250 --> 02:46:12,800
I think there was a shepherd one 
yesterday that died.

3659
02:46:12,830 --> 02:46:13,663
Just taking people out.
People would just mysteriously getting 

3660
02:46:15,771 --> 02:46:17,270
whacked.
And they're billionaires.

3661
02:46:17,600 --> 02:46:18,710
Oh really?
Yes.

3662
02:46:18,940 --> 02:46:20,210
They're whack.
And billionaires.

3663
02:46:20,230 --> 02:46:21,980
Jesus.
They're just whacking people,

3664
02:46:22,370 --> 02:46:23,840
you know too much.
Oh yeah.

3665
02:46:24,050 --> 02:46:26,210
Come fish.
Let's go fishing.

3666
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,810
These guys are disappearing.
They're not fucking around.

3667
02:46:29,811 --> 02:46:30,550
Tom.
Papa,

3668
02:46:30,550 --> 02:46:32,450
do you think that control?
Do you think that they,

3669
02:46:32,680 --> 02:46:35,000
uh,
did they look at that?

3670
02:46:35,090 --> 02:46:36,980
Russian diplomats keep dying 
unexpectedly.

3671
02:46:36,981 --> 02:46:38,450
Look at his face.
Holy shit.

3672
02:46:38,451 --> 02:46:42,320
He just terrifying to me is terrifying.
He's like one of those help pigs.

3673
02:46:43,010 --> 02:46:43,843
We want to think that the world,
the world has learned from hitler and 

3674
02:46:46,491 --> 02:46:48,620
stalin and mussolini.
The world's learn.

3675
02:46:48,680 --> 02:46:51,470
they're not going to do that again.
I don't buy that.

3676
02:46:51,530 --> 02:46:52,570
No.
The number.

3677
02:46:52,600 --> 02:46:54,140
what they say.
The number one it says on here,

3678
02:46:54,141 --> 02:46:56,450
six have died since november.
This was.

3679
02:46:56,451 --> 02:47:01,451
So does it make you more frightened that
they were interfering in our election?

3680
02:47:02,480 --> 02:47:02,840
well,

3681
02:47:02,840 --> 02:47:03,673
they certainly were aware of what was 
going on and they certainly had access 

3682
02:47:08,210 --> 02:47:12,580
to some documents about the dnc.
The what?

3683
02:47:12,640 --> 02:47:16,250
What concerns me is people that are 
ignoring.

3684
02:47:16,370 --> 02:47:18,110
Although that is an issue for sure,
right?

3685
02:47:18,470 --> 02:47:23,150
But they're ignoring that.
What they did was they let us know about

3686
02:47:23,151 --> 02:47:23,984
some horrible shit that the democrats 
were up to where they were rigging the 

3687
02:47:26,721 --> 02:47:27,554
primaries and fucking over bernie 
sanders because he was too powerful and 

3688
02:47:30,351 --> 02:47:33,080
too dangerous to hillary clinton.
So they concluded,

3689
02:47:33,110 --> 02:47:34,510
they all used,
they,

3690
02:47:34,550 --> 02:47:36,230
they,
they conspired rather,

3691
02:47:36,260 --> 02:47:40,910
and they all use their influence to fuck
over bernie sanders and then saying that

3692
02:47:40,911 --> 02:47:41,744
the russians hacked the election because
they exposed that the democrats are a 

3693
02:47:44,121 --> 02:47:47,810
bunch of cheat and creeps is kinda 
disingenuous because yes,

3694
02:47:47,811 --> 02:47:48,644
they did hack the election because they 
did release some of that information so 

3695
02:47:50,871 --> 02:47:51,704
they did have an impact on it,
but that impact was essentially the 

3696
02:47:53,691 --> 02:47:57,020
truth and something that we really 
deserve to know in the first place.

3697
02:47:57,260 --> 02:47:59,510
We deserve to know the inner workings of
the dnc.

3698
02:47:59,511 --> 02:48:00,344
We deserved to know that,
that they are getting in the way of 

3699
02:48:03,651 --> 02:48:04,484
democracy.

3700
02:48:04,710 --> 02:48:06,660
They're rigging it.
Yeah.

3701
02:48:06,661 --> 02:48:08,320
Well there,
you know.

3702
02:48:08,400 --> 02:48:09,330
Yeah,
they're rigging it.

3703
02:48:09,360 --> 02:48:12,170
Politics is always dirty.
There's no politics.

3704
02:48:12,200 --> 02:48:14,630
It's illegal.
What they were doing was wrong.

3705
02:48:14,720 --> 02:48:18,470
Like what they were doing was they were 
interfering with the democratic process.

3706
02:48:18,560 --> 02:48:19,393
Whether or not it's illegal.
It can be argued in court and maybe 

3707
02:48:20,691 --> 02:48:23,270
should be,
but it's most certainly not what anybody

3708
02:48:23,271 --> 02:48:26,970
wants.
We want the dnc to dictate who we are.

3709
02:48:27,070 --> 02:48:28,070
What are the primary is

3710
02:48:28,080 --> 02:48:30,310
we want people to dictate it.
We all sit in one,

3711
02:48:30,311 --> 02:48:31,144
Joe Kennedy putting people didn't want 
Joe Kennedy putting his bing in and 

3712
02:48:35,920 --> 02:48:39,970
stealing votes for his son to be sure 
that this stuff is always go on,

3713
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:44,290
but that doesn't excuse it.
But now with the sidling up to that guy,

3714
02:48:45,190 --> 02:48:47,410
you know what I mean?
That that guy,

3715
02:48:47,830 --> 02:48:51,010
for whatever reason it is,
he wants to defeat us.

3716
02:48:51,011 --> 02:48:52,780
Right?
So any kind of,

3717
02:48:52,810 --> 02:48:53,643
any kind of influence in that,
people within that campaign are now 

3718
02:48:57,160 --> 02:48:57,993
having to.
They're getting caught talking to them 

3719
02:49:00,850 --> 02:49:01,683
and then they lied about it for some 
reason they didn't want people to know 

3720
02:49:05,530 --> 02:49:06,363
whatever that was about,
and now you have this foreign enemy who 

3721
02:49:13,831 --> 02:49:14,664
is now sidled up with a lot of the 
people who are now running our 

3722
02:49:19,261 --> 02:49:20,850
government.
A government,

3723
02:49:20,851 --> 02:49:22,440
by the way,
that isn't.

3724
02:49:22,770 --> 02:49:25,980
That is hell bent on tearing a lot of 
stuff down.

3725
02:49:26,040 --> 02:49:28,380
You're right,
but what they.

3726
02:49:28,440 --> 02:49:29,273
The only reason why it worked at all was
because the democrats were involved in 

3727
02:49:32,701 --> 02:49:36,030
shady shit.
It's not like they made up some stuff,

3728
02:49:36,270 --> 02:49:37,440
so she's not.
See what I'm saying?

3729
02:49:37,441 --> 02:49:38,430
Yes,
she's dirty.

3730
02:49:38,431 --> 02:49:40,530
They were dirty.
The dnc was dirty,

3731
02:49:40,531 --> 02:49:42,540
but okay.
I'll give you the results.

3732
02:49:42,541 --> 02:49:44,310
Not good results.
Not good.

3733
02:49:44,460 --> 02:49:45,293
No.
Having Donald Trump win in this fashion 

3734
02:49:46,981 --> 02:49:47,814
and having the russians interfered and 
then also having some sort of an 

3735
02:49:49,561 --> 02:49:52,350
influence on him financially,
all those things are not good.

3736
02:49:52,351 --> 02:49:53,184
Yeah,
but it's a little disingenuous to the 

3737
02:49:55,230 --> 02:49:56,063
store.
The fact that hillary was a terrible 

3738
02:49:57,181 --> 02:49:58,290
candidate.
Yes.

3739
02:49:58,380 --> 02:50:01,140
She was so compromised from so many 
different angles.

3740
02:50:01,141 --> 02:50:01,974
I mean,
she didn't support gay marriage until 

3741
02:50:02,731 --> 02:50:04,860
2013,
I think it was.

3742
02:50:05,190 --> 02:50:06,200
She didn't,
um,

3743
02:50:06,360 --> 02:50:08,340
she not only that,
she,

3744
02:50:08,500 --> 02:50:12,060
I mean like the clinton foundation is 
just a disaster,

3745
02:50:12,061 --> 02:50:16,230
like the whole thing and even filled 
with an scary shit and look,

3746
02:50:16,470 --> 02:50:17,303
she was definitely disliked by a lot of 
people from being there for a lot of 

3747
02:50:22,531 --> 02:50:25,890
time doing stuff that made a lot of 
people very nauseous.

3748
02:50:26,100 --> 02:50:27,070
Well,
she was got all of that,

3749
02:50:27,810 --> 02:50:28,643
but I don't want to,
I don't want to go back and redo the 

3750
02:50:30,991 --> 02:50:32,120
election,
but just that,

3751
02:50:32,880 --> 02:50:37,880
just does it concern you that if,
let's say let's be conspiracy theories.

3752
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:39,833
Let's say that the russians,
that the russians have so much more 

3753
02:50:42,631 --> 02:50:45,180
influence over this president by the 
way,

3754
02:50:45,181 --> 02:50:46,014
putting his America first is using 
russian steel for that pipeline that's 

3755
02:50:49,381 --> 02:50:51,270
going through the indians.
Uh,

3756
02:50:51,330 --> 02:50:56,330
if he's that tied to them and their.
And Russia is an enemy of ours.

3757
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:57,833
They want us to fail and now they have 
an administration that wants to tear 

3758
02:51:00,661 --> 02:51:02,100
stuff down.
It.

3759
02:51:02,160 --> 02:51:05,550
Could that be a conspiracy theory on 
that side?

3760
02:51:05,551 --> 02:51:07,110
Certainly could.
But here's the problem,

3761
02:51:07,140 --> 02:51:09,600
what you're saying,
they like the russians.

3762
02:51:09,630 --> 02:51:10,463
They want to do this,
they want to do that when we're buying 

3763
02:51:12,331 --> 02:51:15,090
their steel.
They don't operate as an individual.

3764
02:51:15,330 --> 02:51:16,163
You know,
there are a bunch of people that are 

3765
02:51:16,980 --> 02:51:20,440
trapped in this dictatorship,
but yeah.

3766
02:51:20,460 --> 02:51:25,050
Well the pooting,
but it's when you are buying things,

3767
02:51:25,080 --> 02:51:25,913
if you're buying things from Russia and 
so are there individuals over there is 

3768
02:51:28,560 --> 02:51:32,640
everything Russia and entity and that 
entity wants us dead once it's doomed,

3769
02:51:32,940 --> 02:51:35,430
isn't it possible the people,
well,

3770
02:51:35,431 --> 02:51:36,264
isn't it possible that their government,
their government can evolve like and 

3771
02:51:39,571 --> 02:51:42,420
they can eventually not have that guy in
place that there's some thumped,

3772
02:51:42,480 --> 02:51:43,313
something can take place and they could 
also prosper from this age of 

3773
02:51:47,280 --> 02:51:48,700
information and that 100 percent right?
People,

3774
02:51:48,710 --> 02:51:50,490
the people 100 percent.
Yeah.

3775
02:51:50,870 --> 02:51:54,120
I mean this guy is doing this thing.
I don't know what he's doing.

3776
02:51:54,150 --> 02:51:54,983
Art guy.
I don't want to say this conspiracy to 

3777
02:51:57,351 --> 02:51:58,184
just to.
Just to take the fantasy of are these 

3778
02:52:00,541 --> 02:52:01,980
guys right?
Because like you're saying,

3779
02:52:03,090 --> 02:52:04,860
the wiki leaks,
expose that to the dnc.

3780
02:52:04,861 --> 02:52:07,690
There's also a lot of dirty stuff we 
don't even know right now.

3781
02:52:07,691 --> 02:52:11,350
It's going on for sure on both sides.
Let's just take this fantasy of,

3782
02:52:11,710 --> 02:52:12,543
okay,
so putin is really aggressively wanted 

3783
02:52:14,980 --> 02:52:18,460
this administration and they wanted a 
bannon who wants to tear stuff down.

3784
02:52:18,640 --> 02:52:22,330
This is an advantage for us.
If you can expose that.

3785
02:52:22,331 --> 02:52:24,790
I think that's a.
That's a big deal.

3786
02:52:24,850 --> 02:52:26,410
Yeah.
It's scary,

3787
02:52:26,470 --> 02:52:27,303
but here's the problem.
You're making a bunch of stuff up in 

3788
02:52:28,571 --> 02:52:30,850
order because it is a fantasy.
Yeah,

3789
02:52:30,851 --> 02:52:32,110
but that's.
I,

3790
02:52:32,500 --> 02:52:34,450
I get what you're saying,
but I mean,

3791
02:52:34,451 --> 02:52:35,980
I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to 
do it.

3792
02:52:36,100 --> 02:52:38,140
Of course you could and it's something 
that should be considered,

3793
02:52:38,141 --> 02:52:43,141
but it's a weird thing when you start 
making up motives and potential outcomes

3794
02:52:44,441 --> 02:52:46,500
and look,
it's not good now.

3795
02:52:47,020 --> 02:52:47,853
That's why they're investigating because
they try and find the answers of what 

3796
02:52:49,811 --> 02:52:50,940
this stuff really is.
Well,

3797
02:52:50,950 --> 02:52:52,270
there's all sorts of shit that's not 
good.

3798
02:52:52,330 --> 02:52:54,220
There's all sorts of shit that's not 
good about this.

3799
02:52:54,260 --> 02:52:55,540
This whole situation.
Yeah.

3800
02:52:55,710 --> 02:52:56,543
There's like there's way too much power 
and influence by one person and that 

3801
02:53:02,050 --> 02:53:06,100
person's that person's cabinet in that 
person's choices.

3802
02:53:06,460 --> 02:53:08,320
What choices they make on the rest of us
and we're,

3803
02:53:08,321 --> 02:53:10,690
we're seeing that now.
Wayne gets way too much,

3804
02:53:10,750 --> 02:53:11,583
way too much,
and it's more than we've ever seen 

3805
02:53:12,581 --> 02:53:13,414
before.
We've never seen someone come in with a 

3806
02:53:14,350 --> 02:53:18,070
sweeping brush of change and just 
decide,

3807
02:53:18,071 --> 02:53:19,330
nope.
Fuck obamacare.

3808
02:53:19,331 --> 02:53:20,960
No building that fucking wall.
No,

3809
02:53:21,050 --> 02:53:22,570
we're running those pipes.
Nope.

3810
02:53:22,571 --> 02:53:23,680
Dakota pipeline.
Fuck.

3811
02:53:23,681 --> 02:53:25,470
You were coming through like,
whoa.

3812
02:53:25,471 --> 02:53:26,680
It's,
and it's happening within the

3813
02:53:27,080 --> 02:53:29,300
60 days.
Doesn't it seem a lot of.

3814
02:53:29,301 --> 02:53:30,134
It's mean,
mean let's take dakota pipeline on both 

3815
02:53:33,621 --> 02:53:35,870
sides.
Dakota pipeline seems mean.

3816
02:53:35,990 --> 02:53:38,360
Seems dumping waste into the water.
Seems me.

3817
02:53:38,361 --> 02:53:41,210
What does that waste and water where 
they're dumping coal waste?

3818
02:53:41,300 --> 02:53:44,270
Whereas I made it illegal in West 
Virginia and so that you couldn't,

3819
02:53:44,271 --> 02:53:45,560
um,
now drop it again.

3820
02:53:45,610 --> 02:53:49,520
Now you can dump it again.
Like there's like,

3821
02:53:49,840 --> 02:53:53,090
I want to talk about shutting down.
I'm scary.

3822
02:53:53,120 --> 02:53:58,120
Pbs.
Well those guys are monotone.

3823
02:54:00,520 --> 02:54:04,250
This is all means shit to the people 
making cooking shows.

3824
02:54:04,300 --> 02:54:05,870
So those people were attacking him,
right?

3825
02:54:05,900 --> 02:54:07,200
Is that what it is?
No,

3826
02:54:07,480 --> 02:54:09,890
it's always a republican thing.
I think it's just to get people mad,

3827
02:54:10,040 --> 02:54:10,873
but you know what?
I mean like just can't you act out a 

3828
02:54:12,141 --> 02:54:15,770
kindness if you enjoyed any part of this
program and you'd like to donate,

3829
02:54:15,771 --> 02:54:18,260
please do.
We survive on donations.

3830
02:54:18,380 --> 02:54:19,213
We appreciate you.
I always think that those guys just 

3831
02:54:21,171 --> 02:54:22,004
can't wait to,
as soon as that fucking shows to run 

3832
02:54:24,021 --> 02:54:24,854
home and put a ball gag on punch 
themselves in the dick and just there 

3833
02:54:28,720 --> 02:54:32,390
are so tied down.
That's so not how a man thinks or talks.

3834
02:54:32,650 --> 02:54:33,483
It's so funny for tuning into.
Its very interesting fresh air with 

3835
02:54:37,251 --> 02:54:38,690
terry.
Gross is up next.

3836
02:54:38,780 --> 02:54:42,380
Very interesting.
We're going to talk about who are you.

3837
02:54:42,381 --> 02:54:43,214
Fuck.
What would you do if a terrorist attack 

3838
02:54:44,721 --> 02:54:45,554
is happening right now?
What would you do if a man came in with 

3839
02:54:47,751 --> 02:54:49,910
his dick in his hand,
I'm going to fuck your mouth.

3840
02:54:50,740 --> 02:54:51,573
Well,
I mean there's probably a reason he 

3841
02:54:53,331 --> 02:54:54,620
wants to do that.
Wow.

3842
02:54:55,760 --> 02:54:56,593
We have to understand that I'm not 
consenting it sending to you doing this 

3843
02:54:59,091 --> 02:55:01,100
to me.
This is probably a very good reason.

3844
02:55:01,101 --> 02:55:04,070
It was his father probably did it to him
and I just

3845
02:55:04,070 --> 02:55:05,420
don't.
You know what I mean?

3846
02:55:05,450 --> 02:55:06,960
I just.
It feels like,

3847
02:55:07,870 --> 02:55:10,010
like can we come from a place of,
of,

3848
02:55:10,080 --> 02:55:11,900
of kindness rather than,
well,

3849
02:55:11,901 --> 02:55:12,380
he's

3850
02:55:12,380 --> 02:55:13,680
prosperity right now.
He's,

3851
02:55:13,700 --> 02:55:16,100
he's ramping up the prosperity.
That's what he wants to do.

3852
02:55:16,460 --> 02:55:21,380
I think he feels like he can get people 
to love him again and yet the country on

3853
02:55:21,381 --> 02:55:23,420
track,
if he creates all these jobs.

3854
02:55:23,421 --> 02:55:24,860
That's why I had this big video 
announcement,

3855
02:55:24,861 --> 02:55:25,694
your story where he was talking about 
exxon investing in the gulf coast and 

3856
02:55:28,611 --> 02:55:31,880
they're going to get all these jobs and 
there's going to be like 45,000

3857
02:55:31,881 --> 02:55:34,850
jobs and the jobs are going to be paying
$100,000

3858
02:55:34,851 --> 02:55:35,684
on the average,
so all these great jobs and he's very 

3859
02:55:37,611 --> 02:55:38,900
excited about announcing that.

3860
02:55:39,440 --> 02:55:43,280
Most likely it's all tied to oil.
It's all tied to oil.

3861
02:55:43,340 --> 02:55:45,140
That's where the money is in resources,
right?

3862
02:55:46,050 --> 02:55:48,260
In that model,
in that old model,

3863
02:55:48,560 --> 02:55:50,480
you don't.
It doesn't have to be that model,

3864
02:55:50,660 --> 02:55:53,990
but he wants to get America putting tons
of people to work.

3865
02:55:54,020 --> 02:55:56,800
Thousands.
There are thousands of people.

3866
02:55:56,801 --> 02:56:01,070
They're fucking driving cars.
They're killing people.

3867
02:56:01,250 --> 02:56:04,500
I love people like brought up two people
have died too.

3868
02:56:05,050 --> 02:56:08,020
We're acting like hawks by the way,
who were like,

3869
02:56:08,330 --> 02:56:11,510
I'm looking at videos on his ipad.
Dude.

3870
02:56:11,511 --> 02:56:13,730
Autonomous cars are coming.
Whether you like it or not.

3871
02:56:13,760 --> 02:56:16,040
It's the best.
Do you do it with yours?

3872
02:56:16,060 --> 02:56:17,340
Yeah,
he turned your chest.

3873
02:56:17,450 --> 02:56:19,550
Just start beating off?
Yes.

3874
02:56:20,390 --> 02:56:22,280
I'm hard right now that you just said 
tesla.

3875
02:56:27,250 --> 02:56:29,430
Do you do it everywhere?
It just on the highway or how do you.

3876
02:56:29,770 --> 02:56:31,100
The on the freeway?
Yeah.

3877
02:56:31,101 --> 02:56:33,410
You put your hands on the wheel at all?
Sometimes.

3878
02:56:33,440 --> 02:56:34,080
A little bit.
Yeah.

3879
02:56:34,080 --> 02:56:34,913
I'll keep them loose on it,
but sometimes if it's traffic I don't 

3880
02:56:37,371 --> 02:56:38,330
touch it at all.
And um,

3881
02:56:38,331 --> 02:56:40,040
just uh,
she just turning emails.

3882
02:56:40,220 --> 02:56:42,170
You're returning emails while you're 
driving?

3883
02:56:42,171 --> 02:56:45,320
I'm not driving the cars driving.
That's so nuts man.

3884
02:56:45,350 --> 02:56:46,400
Yeah.
If you're in traffic,

3885
02:56:46,401 --> 02:56:49,730
just going to do.
And so the car takes over.

3886
02:56:49,760 --> 02:56:51,500
He takes us exit that it's supposed to 
take.

3887
02:56:52,260 --> 02:56:54,590
You got to do that.
You take over when you leave it.

3888
02:56:54,850 --> 02:56:57,830
Oh,
it's the next version that comes out.

3889
02:56:57,831 --> 02:57:00,800
The end of this year is going to be 
doing when you leave it the freeway.

3890
02:57:01,040 --> 02:57:02,590
Oh,
so it only works on the freeway?

3891
02:57:02,591 --> 02:57:04,880
No,
it works on the side streets,

3892
02:57:04,881 --> 02:57:09,881
but it doesn't read stop signs or 
traffic lights.

3893
02:57:10,490 --> 02:57:14,700
What kind of piece of shit is this guy 
hasn't got the uptake.

3894
02:57:14,840 --> 02:57:18,260
It needs the gps and all this other 
stuff to,

3895
02:57:18,270 --> 02:57:19,040
uh,
to work,

3896
02:57:19,040 --> 02:57:22,040
to do surface streets.
It was when it's on the freeway,

3897
02:57:22,250 --> 02:57:24,290
the car is reading the cars in front of 
it,

3898
02:57:24,350 --> 02:57:26,720
around it,
but doesn't have gps and the,

3899
02:57:26,750 --> 02:57:28,880
and the um,
the signs,

3900
02:57:28,910 --> 02:57:33,910
the signs for a how fast you crossing 
deer crossing deaf child,

3901
02:57:36,030 --> 02:57:39,710
a family.
That's the most depressing fucking thing

3902
02:57:39,711 --> 02:57:41,140
ever.
When you driving from san diego,

3903
02:57:41,480 --> 02:57:45,350
you were an immigrant crossing.
This is a mother holding a child's hand.

3904
02:57:45,351 --> 02:57:46,940
The father's holding her mother's hand.
Like,

3905
02:57:46,970 --> 02:57:48,650
oh man,
I was just,

3906
02:57:48,651 --> 02:57:50,720
those fucking people come over here.
This is the worst.

3907
02:57:50,810 --> 02:57:54,200
I was just in Mexico doing a gig and um,
they,

3908
02:57:54,201 --> 02:57:56,630
uh,
I kept asking people about,

3909
02:57:56,660 --> 02:57:58,490
uh,
about uh,

3910
02:57:58,520 --> 02:57:59,353
trump.
They would ask us about trump or you 

3911
02:58:01,081 --> 02:58:02,680
know,
the whole mexican bank.

3912
02:58:03,060 --> 02:58:06,540
And a couple of them,
especially the last guy was like,

3913
02:58:07,480 --> 02:58:09,460
yeah,
I know everybody I know.

3914
02:58:09,461 --> 02:58:10,920
And I don't know.
He seems bad,

3915
02:58:10,921 --> 02:58:12,990
but have you met our president of their 
presence?

3916
02:58:12,991 --> 02:58:14,370
Terrible.
It's the most corrupt guy.

3917
02:58:14,371 --> 02:58:16,230
He doesn't help any of us.
He's awful.

3918
02:58:16,470 --> 02:58:18,090
It was like.
Oh right.

3919
02:58:18,200 --> 02:58:20,500
Yeah.
He's way worse leaders.

3920
02:58:20,550 --> 02:58:21,390
Just shithead too.

3921
02:58:21,500 --> 02:58:22,790
Yeah.
All these leaders.

3922
02:58:22,880 --> 02:58:24,020
All of them.
Yeah,

3923
02:58:24,021 --> 02:58:26,390
and these are like the leaders that are 
probably the best.

3924
02:58:26,720 --> 02:58:27,553
Yeah,
because you go.

3925
02:58:27,680 --> 02:58:29,870
How about that guy in the Philippines?
It's just shooting people.

3926
02:58:29,900 --> 02:58:31,250
Yeah.
If you're out there doing drugs,

3927
02:58:31,251 --> 02:58:34,370
I'm shooting you shoot and drug dealers 
killing everybody.

3928
02:58:34,520 --> 02:58:37,400
You got to do what you gotta do.
So that's how I roll.

3929
02:58:37,401 --> 02:58:40,350
So I clean the streets up.
Bullets tired,

3930
02:58:40,960 --> 02:58:42,590
bad.
Want to have a sandwich,

3931
02:58:42,591 --> 02:58:46,430
you know?
So I hit that tesla and it just like,

3932
02:58:46,431 --> 02:58:49,130
especially when I drive to school in the
morning and drop the kids off.

3933
02:58:49,880 --> 02:58:51,730
Don't you think now?
I mean I'm,

3934
02:58:51,740 --> 02:58:54,080
I'm always trying to be.
This glass is half full guy.

3935
02:58:54,170 --> 02:58:55,003
Don't you think that the reaction that 
people were having to all these new 

3936
02:58:57,651 --> 02:58:58,484
policies is going to invigorate our 
political system because it's going to 

3937
02:59:01,661 --> 02:59:02,494
inspire people to act and to do 
something and to make some positive 

3938
02:59:05,271 --> 02:59:05,690
change.

3939
02:59:05,690 --> 02:59:09,440
And the people are going to realize how 
important it is to get involved and what

3940
02:59:09,441 --> 02:59:12,530
the consequences are to the environment,
to the world,

3941
02:59:12,531 --> 02:59:13,364
to the future.
If we let someone come in and just 

3942
02:59:15,321 --> 02:59:19,760
solely concentrate on profits,
which is where what you're assuming that

3943
02:59:19,761 --> 02:59:20,594
they're going to do and they're going to
lean towards that and they're going to 

3944
02:59:22,790 --> 02:59:23,623
lower the environmental protection 
agency's regulations and lower the 

3945
02:59:26,691 --> 02:59:27,524
standards for emissions and more 
pollution in the fucking coal mine shit 

3946
02:59:31,191 --> 02:59:33,380
and all that.
Because it's running it like a business.

3947
02:59:33,381 --> 02:59:34,730
People are going to have to react to 
that.

3948
02:59:34,760 --> 02:59:35,593
Yeah,
and then there was a swing the other 

3949
02:59:36,201 --> 02:59:36,500
way.

3950
02:59:36,500 --> 02:59:37,333
There's actually an editorial of the guy
who was the head of the epa during 

3951
02:59:39,801 --> 02:59:44,801
reagan and he was warning pruitt that 
americans have a breaking point.

3952
02:59:47,930 --> 02:59:51,590
They do not like it when they think that
they're.

3953
02:59:51,710 --> 02:59:55,550
That the environment and their health is
in danger because that's our families.

3954
02:59:55,551 --> 02:59:57,140
That's our children.
That's our lives.

3955
02:59:57,680 --> 02:59:58,513
And reagan came in and he was going to 
do some big sweeping things that we're 

3956
03:00:01,941 --> 03:00:04,340
going to be more profitable and give us 
more jobs.

3957
03:00:04,760 --> 03:00:09,170
And the,
the fierce fight back from the americans

3958
03:00:09,740 --> 03:00:12,050
had to make them change course.
So yeah,

3959
03:00:12,051 --> 03:00:14,810
I think you're right.
I think especially with that issue,

3960
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:18,690
I think it's entirely possible that you 
could deal with eco terrorism as well.

3961
03:00:18,870 --> 03:00:23,700
Whereas someone could decide that this 
path is wrong and evil and that the best

3962
03:00:23,701 --> 03:00:24,534
way to subvert it would be to do 
something below something up or 

3963
03:00:28,171 --> 03:00:29,070
something,
you know,

3964
03:00:29,100 --> 03:00:33,240
have some sort of reaction where you 
damaged the company or damage the public

3965
03:00:33,241 --> 03:00:38,241
image or mean all this is really tricky.
Five dimensional chess that these people

3966
03:00:38,431 --> 03:00:39,360
are playing.
Yeah.

3967
03:00:39,380 --> 03:00:40,213
You know,
especially when you're dealing with 

3968
03:00:40,531 --> 03:00:41,364
foreign entities now,
north korea's is tested nuclear or 

3969
03:00:43,980 --> 03:00:45,570
ballistic missiles rather.
Yeah.

3970
03:00:45,630 --> 03:00:48,180
And Russia is mean the whole thing.

3971
03:00:48,200 --> 03:00:51,420
Barely.
That's what obama told Donald Trump when

3972
03:00:51,421 --> 03:00:54,690
he was coming in that his greatest 
concern is North Korea.

3973
03:00:54,780 --> 03:00:55,613
Of course,

3974
03:00:55,700 --> 03:00:58,170
that guy is a fucking psychopath.
Yeah.

3975
03:00:58,580 --> 03:01:00,160
He just.
His half brother

3976
03:01:00,660 --> 03:01:03,130
was.
He had someone spraying for airport.

3977
03:01:03,340 --> 03:01:04,990
Yeah.
Like the people that were doing it.

3978
03:01:04,991 --> 03:01:06,040
Thought it was a prank.
Yeah.

3979
03:01:06,080 --> 03:01:08,830
They were dressed like a,
like they were doing a prank,

3980
03:01:09,400 --> 03:01:10,570
didn't they?
Think they were doing a prank.

3981
03:01:10,610 --> 03:01:11,990
They didn't realize.
I believe that the heat,

3982
03:01:12,040 --> 03:01:14,520
they didn't even realize that they were 
doing it all really?

3983
03:01:14,640 --> 03:01:15,730
I don't know.
Maybe I made that up.

3984
03:01:15,760 --> 03:01:16,593
No,
I think you're right.

3985
03:01:16,630 --> 03:01:18,510
I think you're right.
No,

3986
03:01:19,390 --> 03:01:20,223
it's a crazy world joe rogan,
but I think you got to have hope and 

3987
03:01:22,361 --> 03:01:25,900
there's lots of good people out there 
doing good things and you can go see tom

3988
03:01:25,901 --> 03:01:29,440
papa live at a standup comedy club near 
you clubs in colleges.

3989
03:01:29,441 --> 03:01:30,274
Occasionally theaters everywhere.
My podcast come to papa or watches new

3992
03:01:40,331 --> 03:01:41,800

An amazon.

3993
03:01:42,370 --> 03:01:44,860
It's called human mule.
Oh wow.

3994
03:01:44,950 --> 03:01:47,140
Like a drug meal?
No.

3995
03:01:47,730 --> 03:01:49,640
What's it about a father?
Oh,

3996
03:01:52,280 --> 03:01:53,340
well tom,
dad,

3997
03:01:53,410 --> 03:01:54,940
we got to do this more often.
Why don't we say this,

3998
03:01:54,941 --> 03:01:57,040
but I'm glad we did it quick compared to
the last one.

3999
03:01:57,080 --> 03:01:58,000
Yeah,

4000

03:02:04,630 --> 03:02:07,220
They're such nice people.
They really are great people.

4004
03:02:07,221 --> 03:02:08,054
You know,
I've done some very popular radio shows 

4005
03:02:09,471 --> 03:02:13,430
where people are awful,
you know,

4006
03:02:13,520 --> 03:02:15,070
funny but awful,
right?

4007
03:02:15,210 --> 03:02:16,043
Your people are like,
I get more responses of people asking 

4008
03:02:19,080 --> 03:02:19,913
about how to make bread is sending me 
the recipes and stuff and just really 

4009
03:02:23,241 --> 03:02:25,970
funny it was.
See this like perform together,

4010
03:02:25,971 --> 03:02:27,340
whatever.
They're just a uva

4011
03:02:27,550 --> 03:02:28,151
crowd.
Well,

4012
03:02:28,151 --> 03:02:28,984
if you really enjoy you to and the kind 
of perspective that you provided today 

4013
03:02:32,021 --> 03:02:32,854
where you're leaning towards just being 
nicer and being kinder and not getting 

4014
03:02:37,241 --> 03:02:38,074
involved in any bullshit and,
and recognizing that that's what makes 

4015
03:02:41,021 --> 03:02:42,830
people happy.
It's just to find,

4016
03:02:42,970 --> 03:02:44,740
find a passion,
follow it,

4017
03:02:44,741 --> 03:02:46,060
enjoy yourself,
live your life,

4018
03:02:46,070 --> 03:02:47,140
be nice.
Is it?

4019
03:02:47,240 --> 03:02:49,130
This is it.
We are in prime time.

4020
03:02:49,490 --> 03:02:52,460
If you are listening to this show,
if you're doing this show,

4021
03:02:52,760 --> 03:02:53,990
it's not.
This is it.

4022
03:02:54,110 --> 03:02:56,270
This is it.

4024
03:02:58,551 --> 03:02:59,810
stronger.

It doesn't get better.

much.

All right folks.
