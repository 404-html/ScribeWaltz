1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:02,340
Good experience.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:03,570
No,

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,740
the guy who has the accordion,

4
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:05,580
the monkey dance,

5
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,440
monkey dance isn't.

6
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,450
I love the sound of the
accordion and I just,

7
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:10,110
uh,

8
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,890
I saw it and I just wanted
to bring something to the
new studio and like how you

9
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:15,000
have a lot of weird shit here.

10
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,670
And this is weird that somebody loved
this sound so much that they decided let's

11
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:21,750
make an instrument out of it.

12
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:22,230
Yeah.

13
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,090
Are there like,

14
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,300
real complicated ones?

15
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:25,570
Those are like big.

16
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,170
Do people play them in
orchestras and shit?

17
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,041
No,

18
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:31,110
I don't think they ever
made it into the orchestra.

19
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,250
So it's never been like a really respected
piece of musical instrument design.

20
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,090
Co,

21
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:36,990
New Orleans,

22
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:37,441
buckwheat,

23
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:37,951
Zydeco.

24
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:39,890
You ever hear that back?

25
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,340
Like polka lot of Polish Polka Zam fear,

26
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:45,600
master of the Pan Flu.

27
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,380
Of course.

28
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,640
What happened to that poor bastard?

29
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,110
Like he had a whole
marketing team behind me.

30
00:00:50,111 --> 00:00:50,341
They're like,

31
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:50,880
dude,

32
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,780
no one's done this.

33
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:52,621
No one's done this,

34
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:53,490
but we're going to do this.

35
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,800
You can master the Pan Flute,

36
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:55,643
Dvds,

37
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,520
cds,

38
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,080
vhs tapes.

39
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,370
We're going to sell it all.

40
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,020
There's literally no competition.

41
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,450
There's nothing you can do your exam fear.

42
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,450
He's the Tony Hawk of the Pan Flute,

43
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,300
right volume with this guy,

44
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,293
beautiful music

45
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,960
radio and the chest hair and change one
gold chain records around the world.

46
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,130
20 million records.

47
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,120
What

48
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:21,430
zone?

49
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,263
Peter?

50
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,940
In his magnificent.

51
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,480
It looks like a guy
that works in the Deli.

52
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,460
That is a very forgettable sound.

53
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,590
It's a recorder.

54
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:34,480
It's for like when the.

55
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,630
One of the things you learn when you're
in fourth grade and they teach them

56
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:38,300
music.

57
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:38,840
Yeah.

58
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,980
That goofy flute like thing.

59
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,230
I never.

60
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,830
I never paid attention to the recorder
because they gave me the recorder and I

61
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:46,161
go,

62
00:01:46,161 --> 00:01:46,700
well,

63
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,370
how come I don't see this band's

64
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:50,781
the fuck out of here.

65
00:01:50,781 --> 00:01:55,050
I'm not going to spend some time
learning an instrument that no one plays.

66
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,800
You need to carry it in your sock.

67
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,140
You remember you had to put in your slack.

68
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,430
They didn't even have cases.

69
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:01,821
Leave this,

70
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:06,821
gave you a good old tube sock from
your dad and put it in there right now.

71
00:02:07,271 --> 00:02:09,380
Makes a case for the fucking recorder.

72
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,130
Now you have to put in your dad's sock
and it didn't make any sense either that

73
00:02:13,131 --> 00:02:13,340
it was.

74
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:13,611
Oh,

75
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:14,440
he's got it.

76
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,830
He was tall,

77
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,700
but he plays a flute,

78
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,120
right?

79
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,300
Well,

80
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,590
it said pamphlet when I typed it in,

81
00:02:18,591 --> 00:02:19,800
but flute rock flew.

82
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:19,940
Well,

83
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,130
he's a bad motherfucker.

84
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:21,330
Yeah.

85
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,520
JETHRO tull.

86
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:25,881
He's quitting.

87
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:27,050
Crazy looking dude.

88
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,110
He looks like he lives
in a hollowed out tree,

89
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,630
right?

90
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,813
He does.

91
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,483
Oh my God.

92
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,281
Scurries out.

93
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:38,600
When you walk by on the trail.

94
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,790
I know his.

95
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,340
Anybody else figured out how to use the
flute in rock and roll music besides

96
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:44,180
Jethro Tull?

97
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,400
We need to know we're not alone.

98
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:46,730
Yes.

99
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:47,840
When all our madness.

100
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,000
What was it like on the set when you
were working with Dave Chappelle?

101
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,140
It was great.

102
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,291
Well,

103
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,580
I've known Dan for a long time.

104
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:57,581
I was actually on the very first episode
we by chance I was walking through New

105
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,760
York and I saw dave and this
was before the show had.

106
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:01,910
Even Beth.

107
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,280
I didn't even know it existed,

108
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,280
but I rented a Bobcat Goldthwait
who's there and I'm like,

109
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:06,761
what's up man?

110
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:07,301
What do you guys do?

111
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:07,990
And he's like,

112
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,321
he goes,

113
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:08,471
oh,

114
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:09,370
hey joe,

115
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,870
we're doing a TV sketch,

116
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:11,171
man,

117
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:12,160
you want to be in on it?

118
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:12,941
And I go,

119
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:15,070
I only have like 20
minutes away to a meeting.

120
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:15,311
He goes,

121
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:16,270
here he goes,

122
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,570
we're handing out ribbons
for New York boobs.

123
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,700
And he had a box,

124
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:25,810
so it's me and him walking through
Manhattan and he's got this crazy fake

125
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:26,830
mustache on and he's like,

126
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,290
you've got the best New York boobs anyway,

127
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,950
to give someone like a ribbon for heaven,

128
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,691
New York boobs.

129
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:33,640
And it was really silly but fun.

130
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,781
And so I was like,

131
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:35,080
well,

132
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,920
Dave's got a show.

133
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,120
And then turns out it's the greatest
show in the history of the world.

134
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,420
And a year later he calls me up again
and asked me to do this thing for.

135
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,890
They wanted to do a fear factor
sketch with tyrone Brigham's.

136
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,251
Yeah.

137
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:49,150
So that's me and him.

138
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,130
A fresh faced Joe Rogan
and Dave Chappelle bit you.

139
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:52,600
Yeah.

140
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,410
Well this is like,

141
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,490
what year is this?

142
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:55,930
Yeah,

143
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,700
I think it's before that is it.

144
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,320
I think it's before that,

145
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:01,600
I want to say it's 2002 maybe.

146
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:01,870
Yeah.

147
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,351
Because,

148
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:02,681
uh,

149
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:06,460
I wasn't even doing the show back
then and I was doing that in 2003,

150
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,800
so I think it's 2002.

151
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:09,990
Uh,

152
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,940
the fear factor bit is one of my favorite.

153
00:04:11,941 --> 00:04:12,661
That's a season two,

154
00:04:12,661 --> 00:04:13,250
if I recall.

155
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:13,591
Think so.

156
00:04:13,591 --> 00:04:13,891
Yeah.

157
00:04:13,891 --> 00:04:14,390
And,

158
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,760
uh,

159
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,550
is really one of the areas,

160
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,830
one of the funniest
bits in a show that is,

161
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:20,850
I would argue

162
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,560
perhaps the greatest
television show of all time.

163
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,470
I think it's the greatest
sketch comedy show of all time.

164
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,123
Something bigger.

165
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,190
It's hard to say that though,

166
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:33,640
because if you boil down a lot
of the all time great shows,

167
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:35,620
like in living color or
some of the other ones.

168
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,160
Boy,

169
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,480
they had so many seasons.

170
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:39,580
If you boiled them down to two seasons,

171
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,290
maybe there would be some.

172
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,400
But he's got some sketches
that worst just groundbreaking,

173
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:48,520
like the black white
supremacist who was blind.

174
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:49,354
Yeah.

175
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:50,781
What about,

176
00:04:50,781 --> 00:04:54,610
I was watching last night because jeff
and I were talking about last night on

177
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,660
the car ride home from
this event we did together.

178
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,040
I was watching black Bush,

179
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,173
which was another,

180
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,860
I think unbelievably,

181
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,910
which released season two where
he plays George w dot Bush,

182
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:09,911
his version of Georgia and
all the rationales for going
into the war in Iraq and

183
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:11,520
it's unbelievably funny.

184
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,101
Yeah,

185
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:13,030
he's a genius.

186
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,560
He's a real comedy genius,

187
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:16,690
but also a guy who's.

188
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:17,860
You don't,

189
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,100
you wouldn't get it if you just
sort of see him do standup,

190
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:23,170
but he's deeply introspective,

191
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,090
like very intensely.

192
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,470
Well thought out,

193
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:26,981
you know,

194
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:27,460
he's not,

195
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,570
he's not a surface guy by any
stretch of the imagination.

196
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,403
Sure.

197
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,600
But it ended up being
just this amazing finish.

198
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:36,973
So anyways,

199
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,830
when I tell Ari I want to go to this,

200
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,500
I'm kind of thinking that's the Ballpark,

201
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,570
like because that's the
only experience I have.

202
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,040
So the games in Atlanta,

203
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,010
he buys tickets and I'm like,

204
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,400
I go,

205
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,270
you're not flying me coach,

206
00:05:50,271 --> 00:05:50,631
you know that.

207
00:05:50,631 --> 00:05:50,901
He's like,

208
00:05:50,901 --> 00:05:51,370
no,

209
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,580
you go first bird rookies coach.

210
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,953
He was

211
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:56,820
coach,

212
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,010
I'll them a seat belt extension.

213
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,450
Oh cool.

214
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,590
But Brian ended up going
from somewhere else.

215
00:06:01,591 --> 00:06:01,971
So anyways,

216
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:02,804
he bought the ticket.

217
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,160
He got an Airbnb,

218
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,570
a really nice house,

219
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:05,990
you know,

220
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,250
for a few days in Atlanta and then it's a,

221
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:10,711
you know,

222
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:11,990
it's the big thing that is game day.

223
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:12,800
I'm thinking like,

224
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,290
oh that's cool that you got
these tickets and you got,

225
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,770
you know,

226
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,580
but I think it's reasonable
and then we get to the stadium.

227
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:23,210
It was a total fucking disaster to
get in because trump went to the game,

228
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,800
so it was raining,

229
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:29,830
it was wet secret service everywhere to
our lines to get into the venue and I

230
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:31,461
paid a guy,

231
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:35,450
a security guy 100 bucks to
walk us through the line,

232
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:36,284
which is,

233
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,900
which was almost impossible
because it was so packed.

234
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,300
But I dunno,

235
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,990
he just started walking
us through the line,

236
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,951
like in front of people.

237
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:45,410
People were yelling at the security guy,

238
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,840
which was like so uncomfortable.

239
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:51,020
He's like a young black kid
and like old white people,

240
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:52,340
where the fuck are you doing?

241
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:52,761
He's like,

242
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:53,421
I'm security.

243
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:53,840
And they're like,

244
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,410
you're not just security you piece of
shit like right to is right in front of

245
00:06:57,411 --> 00:06:57,561
us.

246
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:57,981
And I was like,

247
00:06:57,981 --> 00:06:58,814
God damn,

248
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,310
like I just have never seen
someone flip out like that.

249
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,680
What we were doing was highly unethical.

250
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:04,514
We shouldn't have done it.

251
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,740
But like we just weren't
going to wait in that line.

252
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,730
And then burt,

253
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,121
of course,

254
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:09,290
Bert in a crowd like that,

255
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:09,920
he's like,

256
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,700
it's okay.

257
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,570
I'm famous.

258
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,090
Were famous guys like
yelling that to people,

259
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:14,900
which is like,

260
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,271
no,

261
00:07:15,271 --> 00:07:15,740
you did.

262
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,551
Oh absolutely.

263
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:16,881
He's like,

264
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:17,091
he's like,

265
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:18,020
we're everywhere we went.

266
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,180
If we went to a restaurant
they would come and be like,

267
00:07:20,181 --> 00:07:20,361
Hey,

268
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:21,860
can I get you guys something to drink?

269
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:22,620
And he'd be like,

270
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,453
do recognize,

271
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,250
like they were like,

272
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,510
what was he serious?

273
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,120
I think it's part of his like,

274
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:29,870
you know,

275
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,370
whatever style.

276
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:31,791
And then.

277
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:32,600
And they were like,

278
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,081
I'm sorry,

279
00:07:33,081 --> 00:07:36,190
so part of a joke or part of a joy,

280
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,960
he's joking but I'm not.

281
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,310
He's like halfway in the
middle because one time,

282
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,240
one time he was like,

283
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,290
we're famous comedians.

284
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,550
And The lady was like,

285
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:43,701
Oh,

286
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:44,510
I know who you are.

287
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,343
And he was like,

288
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,401
isn't that awesome?

289
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:48,680
Being famous guys shut up.

290
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:49,580
And he was serious.

291
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,420
He's like,

292
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,290
half serious.

293
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,603
He's like,

294
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,500
but it's like you see him in his element.

295
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:59,501
It's like him in with
crowds is really like,

296
00:07:59,691 --> 00:08:01,520
you realized that he really enjoys it.

297
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,910
Like he really enjoys the large groups.

298
00:08:04,911 --> 00:08:06,470
He enjoys being recognized.

299
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,130
He fucking like sometimes we were
walking and people were like,

300
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,880
Hey,

301
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,713
you're the guy.

302
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,070
I've seen you on facebook.

303
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:13,311
He was like,

304
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,144
you want a picture?

305
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,591
And they're like,

306
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:19,424
okay,

307
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:21,891
yeah,

308
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:22,401
he loves it.

309
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,234
He loves it.

310
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,331
And then we,

311
00:08:24,331 --> 00:08:25,790
we're talking about how
like people would say,

312
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:26,240
like,

313
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,410
Tom and I were like,

314
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:27,531
yeah.

315
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:28,364
And they're like,

316
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:28,910
hey.

317
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:29,743
And then they would walk away.

318
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,160
They wouldn't come over to me.

319
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:31,820
They were like,

320
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,480
hi.

321
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,620
And then they'd walk in another way,

322
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,531
but with birth they're like,

323
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:35,364
can I hug you?

324
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,410
Then take their shirt off.

325
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:36,740
They say,

326
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,180
yeah,

327
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:37,900
I love.

328
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,840
I think 55 is an amazing
way class right now.

329
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,350
We argue on Fox that they think they,

330
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,360
they try to get under my skin
and say lightweight is the best.

331
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,710
Divisional said don't play with me.

332
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,640
After Habib B was a beast,

333
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,250
I watched any of his fights.

334
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,270
I watch them.

335
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,440
I'll say I need to go back to my,

336
00:08:58,441 --> 00:08:58,830
um,

337
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,610
my math.

338
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,610
He fights like that every
time he's a monster.

339
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,500
See the Michael Johnson fight.

340
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:05,970
He's telling me to give up.

341
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,710
It must be champ.

342
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,430
Give up,

343
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,190
smashing them his wrestling and his,

344
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:11,970
his,

345
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,930
his ground and pound.

346
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:14,100
It's just so ferocious.

347
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:15,510
It's just on such another level.

348
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,370
And when he gets a hold of guys,

349
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,330
he's getting ahold of guys that are
really good and just ragdoll and I'm like,

350
00:09:21,331 --> 00:09:21,421
what?

351
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:23,050
He did the RDA GMC that fine.

352
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,050
I haven't seen those fines.

353
00:09:25,051 --> 00:09:28,710
I got to go back and look ragdolled rds
and then she just beats the shit out of

354
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:29,100
people.

355
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,000
It gets you to the ground.

356
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:31,170
I was a big fan at that and I'm like,

357
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,004
man,

358
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,000
he's something special.

359
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,830
Something special.

360
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:39,230
And the fact that he did that to
Barboza he wants to move up to 72 shit.

361
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:40,064
No he don't.

362
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,363
Hey,

363
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,490
metabolic meals shit out
and sit in and see my man.

364
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,510
Habib the pack.

365
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,371
Nutrition.

366
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:48,780
Is anybody out there?

367
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:53,730
I'm picking up the tab
cycle as down to 55.

368
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,290
I'm not trying to see.

369
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:55,470
No.

370
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,370
Could be right now.

371
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,833
Yeah,

372
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,730
he's making 55 easy now though,

373
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:00,870
so who knows?

374
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,100
I think what I believe is going to happen
is I think Connor's going to vacate.

375
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,920
I think they're going to strip them
because connor has got $100,000,000 in the

376
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:08,560
bank.

377
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,760
I think he's having fun and talking
shit and he's going to keep training and

378
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:13,320
he's going to make a
big fight in the future,

379
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,040
but I think Khabib versus Tony
is the big fight and fuck.

380
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,570
They might even do that one in Russia.

381
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,610
Would they do that one?

382
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,250
They're talking about doing
a big fight in Russia that.

383
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:22,771
Yeah,

384
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:23,610
if that happens,

385
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,870
well that's a good fight.

386
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:25,231
I mean,

387
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:26,760
everybody's been waiting
to see that fight.

388
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,391
Fuck yeah,

389
00:10:27,391 --> 00:10:27,920
that's good.
