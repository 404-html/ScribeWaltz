1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,330
Did you see this?
And we're back.

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,520
Trump's latest conspiracy.
You know,

3
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:12,354
what is it?
He's,

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,540
I guess he's saying that there's a New
York Times piece that contains a

5
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:17,700
paragraph saying,
trump suggested that the access

6
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:21,180
hollywood tape wasn't real.
So he's like saying that never existed.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,260
Oh No.
You know,

8
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:23,490
he said,
well,

9
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:26,160
I think those are the two microphones on
or something.

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,530
So I was up,
the TV was on.

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,310
So it,
it's,

12
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,720
um,
I think he said like in passing to

13
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:34,680
someone,
like how do we even know?

14
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:36,540
That's real,
dude.

15
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,820
Do you know how tired he must be?
I'm so tired.

16
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:40,800
Just listen.
Just think how tired you are,

17
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:42,570
right?
Just doing normal stuff.

18
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:44,970
Doing podcast,
dual comedy shows,

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,280
you know,
having a girlfriend,

20
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,230
right?
Tiring.

21
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,710
Imagine being 70 and being the fucking
president and being in a position where

22
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:57,330
you're like,
why did I do this?

23
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,310
Why did I do this?
He's got,

24
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:00,300
I mean,
maybe,

25
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,450
maybe let's just give him the benefit of
the doubt.

26
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:05,490
Maybe you went into this job with the
best of intentions,

27
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,600
but it was just overwhelmed by conflict.
Every step of the way.

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,980
He's tested in a way that his character
was never tested before and all these

29
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:15,510
people are mad at them.
It's just hell,

30
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,040
hell on earth.
70 so tired and he's getting the worst

31
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:23,040
comments ever have.
He did like this tired.

32
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,340
But here's the thing.
There was an article that was written,

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,930
not married men not meaning in any way
to disparage the great president of

34
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:32,850
ours,
but there was a article that was

35
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:34,360
written,
um,

36
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,870
a while back that were this guy found
out that trump had some sort of a

37
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:44,400
prescription for an fentimans like way
back in the day,

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,330
which again,
that word's a dirty word,

39
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,910
but let's just break down what that
means.

40
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,470
It's a series and a class of drugs
that's a stimulant and there's a lot of

41
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:57,270
people that use stimulants,
including me.

42
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,520
I love coffee.
I drink these caveman Nitros for a lot

43
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:04,230
of people.
This might as well be a drug,

44
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,890
just 270 milligrams.
This little can,

45
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,790
270 milligrams of caffeine.
So I'm a hypocrite.

46
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,340
I try not to be at least.
So I'm just being honest.

47
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,030
It's nothing wrong with stimulants.
I enjoy coffee,

48
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,110
but that's the only one that I fuck with
other than that new vigil.

49
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,120
I've tried that stuff a few times and I
will try it.

50
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:28,710
Like say if I have to drive home,
if driving home from San Francisco,

51
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,960
it's like 10 o'clock at night and know
I'm not going to get home until three in

52
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:32,100
the morning,
four in the morning,

53
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,130
I will take one of those cause it'll
keep you from falling asleep.

54
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,510
That's what it's made for.
Yes.

55
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,360
It's not high.
Apparently what I've read was that it,

56
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,840
that's what they prescribe it for,
but it would,

57
00:02:41,841 --> 00:02:45,390
it's made for the guy and it was
originally called pro vigil.

58
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,820
Right?
It's two different ones,

59
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:49,740
but they're pretty much the same.
Yeah.

60
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:53,250
But one of them's a new one.
Think new vigils.

61
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:53,850
A new one.
Right.

62
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,000
And I think what they did is like,
there was probably some sort of a,

63
00:02:57,001 --> 00:02:59,040
I don't know,
one of maybe maybe it's an improvement

64
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,500
or maybe it was some sort of a copyright
thing or a trademark thing.

65
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,310
I'm going to ask Jamie that.
Google a bunch of shit.

66
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,650
What did we start with?
Start with the trump,

67
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,850
uh,
amphetamine thing.

68
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,220
But here's the thing,
that's what adderall is folks.

69
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,900
And I know a fucking shit load of people
that are on that stuff and I've talked

70
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:22,060
about it ad nauseum.
I'm sorry if I'm boring you.

71
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,910
I just,
just for people that have never heard me

72
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:26,590
talk about this,
you got to get it out.

73
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,950
Fun Fact.
19.

74
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:29,771
Excuse me.
I said,

75
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:33,460
I think it came from this tweet is which
is guy that was a contributing writer

76
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:34,600
for Vanity Fair.
Yeah.

77
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,760
Kurt,
I can walk,

78
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,540
I believe is the way you say his last
name.

79
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,320
I says fun fact.
In 1982 s trump started taking

80
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,290
amphetamine derivatives.
He says abused them,

81
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,360
but that's,
that's his classification,

82
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:48,700
right?
Only supposed to take two for 25 days.

83
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:50,680
Stayed on for eight years.
Really?

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,650
The second tweet,
where were the one below?

85
00:03:52,651 --> 00:03:55,680
It says wives.
White House admitted to edit to me.

86
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,530
He took it for a short amount of time
for a diet.

87
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,811
Oh,
a diet.

88
00:03:59,811 --> 00:04:02,690
When he was not overweight,
I counted with med records.

89
00:04:02,691 --> 00:04:07,130
They cut me off.
People misreading dread was drug was

90
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,950
though propane,
75 milligrams a day.

91
00:04:09,951 --> 00:04:12,860
Prescriptions filled at Duane reed on 57
wow.

92
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,780
Not that I know things.
He gave out the fucking address of the

93
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,910
Duane Reed where it was prescribed or
fulfilled.

94
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:20,781
Yeah,
man,

95
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:23,870
I think I'm for sure.
Without a doubt.

96
00:04:23,871 --> 00:04:25,700
Right?
Like there's a lot of people that enjoy

97
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:28,410
some stimulants.
Can you see him now

98
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,070
getting tan his tan on and get taking
diet pills?

99
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,830
Like that's,
that's how you get,

100
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,280
that's how you get ahead and this is
gonna sound fucked up and it's not

101
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:38,480
entirely true.
Okay.

102
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:41,690
This is why it sounds fucked up because
other people have done it with nothing.

103
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,350
There's people out there that are just
fucking getting up early and run in

104
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,600
mountains and drinking water and kicking
ass.

105
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,710
There are people like that,
but there's a lot of people in business

106
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,000
in a lot of different walks of life that
enjoy stimulants and I am not knocking

107
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:58,040
them.
I just don't want to be really clear

108
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:01,520
about this.
This is just sort of a discussion of it.

109
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,700
I'm not knocking him.
Maybe it's awesome.

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,380
I'm scared of adderall.
I'm scared.

111
00:05:06,381 --> 00:05:07,214
I'd love it.

112
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,840
I,
I've tasted it.

113
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,180
It tastes like,
I mean,

114
00:05:11,181 --> 00:05:12,800
I've had it,
you know what it reminded me of,

115
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:16,610
I tried to do it once.
My friend gave me one and I took half of

116
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,260
the wine and I went on stage like later
and it felt like I was on coke,

117
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,250
like in the,
you know,

118
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:24,680
like if you tried to do coke on,
uh,

119
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,900
before you do comedy,
your timing's off.

120
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,030
You know,
you start like you're just going through

121
00:05:29,031 --> 00:05:32,000
your shit super fast.
And that's what I felt like.

122
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:33,470
And I'm like,
I'm never doing that again.

123
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,920
And then I had it one more time,
like years later,

124
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,480
uh,
when I was doing something,

125
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:40,430
I had to stay awake and I just felt
jittery.

126
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,830
Like I,
I didn't like it compared to like

127
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,350
nuvigil where you didn't have like the
jitters or the,

128
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,880
the adderall type feeling

129
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,580
nuvigil doesn't give you any of that,
right?

130
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,540
Yeah,
you're just on.

131
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,240
Yeah.
Yeah.

132
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,970
It's weird,
but it doesn't,

133
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,110
um,
it doesn't,

134
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,650
you don't feel like it stimulates you.
I feel like it just doesn't,

135
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,240
that keeps you out of level,
but it doesn't take any heart.

136
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:01,350
Jesus sounds like a new vigil.
Add this,

137
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:02,780
this,
this shit is.

138
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:06,770
So this is the thing about new vigil.
I had a conversation with Tim Ferris

139
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:09,650
about this,
you know Tim Ferriss didn't put that in

140
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:14,120
one of his biohacking books specifically
because he felt like if he did,

141
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,600
people would eat it like candy and I
went holy Shit.

142
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:23,030
Like when on a guy like Tim Ferriss,
extremely influential guy that spends a

143
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:28,031
lot of time doing like biohacking and
improvement shit like he does for that

144
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:33,410
guy to say he didn't want to write about
new vigil or pro vigil at a book because

145
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:34,700
he didn't want people eating it like
candy.

146
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,740
Like Holy Shit.
Listen to him.

147
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,740
And one of the things that he said that
I thought was very important,

148
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:41,960
he said there's no biological free
lunch.

149
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,930
So there's gotta be some sort of
repercussions for taking that.

150
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,510
And maybe we won't know for 20 years.
Right.

151
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,540
That's the thing,
like something's happening,

152
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,950
right?
You're doing something.

153
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:55,490
If it gets you fired up now it's not a
natural thing.

154
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:58,940
So it's not like you're taking vitamins
and those vitamins like b 12 or

155
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:01,160
something like that stimulates you.
It gives you energy.

156
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:03,620
It's not that,
okay,

157
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:07,030
so is it bad that it's not that is it
bad or cat?

158
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,960
How much,
how many chemicals are bad and how many

159
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:12,710
chemicals are okay and how do you know?
I mean

160
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,290
look at sugar man.
W we we are now learning a sugar is like

161
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:19,020
the worst thing in the whole entire
world because of the sugar industry.

162
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,340
And back in the day was like sell this,
sell this fats bad,

163
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:26,000
you know,
and him and now we know that sugar is

164
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:29,840
one of the biggest things for heart
disease and all that crap and the,

165
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,010
they're weasels.
What'd you pull up?

166
00:07:32,011 --> 00:07:34,300
The comparison chart on new vaginal and
provigil.

167
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,860
They're almost the same thing.
One is modafinil and the other one is

168
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,220
our modafinil.
And so they have some sort of a here.

169
00:07:41,221 --> 00:07:43,200
The mechanism of action is slightly
different on them.

170
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:44,820
That's the only thing I can tell.
It's different.

171
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,330
Is One an improvement of the other eye

172
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,280
can't really looks at new bridges,
has slightly different functions to

173
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,001
shit.
Yeah.

174
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:57,710
It's something about electronic couple
anyway.

175
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,360
Thank you.

176
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,000
The fact that I've taken this,
no,

177
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,480
they'll listen to what this is.
This stuff is,

178
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:09,830
it may activate orexin peptides via
stimulation of Orexin receptors.

179
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,920
Oh x one and x two and may also
increase.

180
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,060
Ready for this one glue to glue to
Metta.

181
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:22,020
Metallurgic Gluten,
Matt Dirge,

182
00:08:22,021 --> 00:08:25,020
Dick [inaudible],
Gouda muttered chick.

183
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:30,190
Is that I say it and it sounds right.
Glutamatergic concentrations decrease ga

184
00:08:30,221 --> 00:08:34,500
be allergic activation and increase
electronic coupling.

185
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:38,310
I who knows what that means.
Rhonda.

186
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:39,650
Patrick.
Well she,

187
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,150
she probably would have to go.
Okay.

188
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,630
And then she to like lay it out and then
we would listen to it afterwards.

189
00:08:45,631 --> 00:08:46,750
Like,
oh,

190
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,710
whenever she talks,
I always feel like I'm some sort of like

191
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,720
a a stupid monkey person.
I'm like stupid monkey of question for

192
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:56,190
smart

193
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,380
lady.
Please tell me how the body works.

194
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,170
What is electronic coupling that we've
got to get to the bottom of that cause

195
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:02,940
that's electronic.
That's a problem.

196
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,550
How do we have something electronic in
us?

197
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,250
How was like a thing?
You have to worry about what you're

198
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:10,350
trying to stay awake.
What is it the fuck?

199
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,820
We're robots,
dude.

200
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:14,190
Magic.
That's how we found out by looking at

201
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:16,110
the ingredients of new vigil and were
like,

202
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:16,531
Hey,
hey,

203
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:17,430
hey,
what does this mean?

204
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,940
Then all of a sudden the fucking
overlords turned the switch and we can

205
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:22,320
see them in front of us.
Sorry,

206
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,460
you guys are robots.
Because his entire time was that God

207
00:09:24,461 --> 00:09:26,850
damn ad agency the whole time that let
it out.

208
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,990
We're doing the bid

209
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,610
bidding for the robot world.
You know what the creepiest fucking

210
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:34,370
quote I ever read it was um,
uh,

211
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,620
God,
Marshall Mcluhan,

212
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,730
he said human beings are the sex organs
of the machine world.

213
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,700
I want,
what the fuck man.

214
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:47,380
And he wrote this Mcluhan was a bad
motherfucker and like our one of a

215
00:09:47,381 --> 00:09:50,520
really underrated visionary,
like you read some of the stuff,

216
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,370
you're like,
Jesus.

217
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:55,390
Like this guy had some insight and I'm
pretty sure he wrote all this stuff in

218
00:09:55,391 --> 00:09:59,450
like the 60s you know,
think of what,

219
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,050
find it,
see if he could find when that quote was

220
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,470
said by Mcluhan or written however it
was,

221
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:09,130
human beings or the sex organs of the
machine world.

222
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,130
I feel like it was in the 60s you wrote
this,

223
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,420
which is like,
wow,

224
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,290
that's so how the fuck did he see that?

225
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,760
That's what it is.
We are some sort of a,

226
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,200
a weird being that makes better and
better technology every year and we'd

227
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:29,380
get pumped about it.
Which is why I wanted to show you that

228
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,510
razor phone.
Oh,

229
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,300
that's so sexy,
man.

230
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:37,200
I can't believe you have that.
1964 64 just stop and think of that.

231
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:41,340
1964 that motherfucker figured it out.
That was all kind of mine.

232
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,510
Probably was covered is that,
that's like,

233
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,820
so look at that.
Look at that.

234
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:46,170
Bright.
That's beautiful man.

235
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:49,980
It's just the razor phone that's
supposed to have the best speaker phone

236
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,270
do to speakers and saying,
yeah,

237
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,250
like it's like a bluetooth.
It's not that loud.

238
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,560
Not that loud.
It's not as loud as a bluetooth,

239
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:57,750
but it's fucking crazy.
Like you watch a movie on it,

240
00:10:57,751 --> 00:10:59,490
it's dope.
You can play games on it.

241
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:00,710
It's incredible.
Yeah.

242
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,160
Sounds like God damn ad for this now.
Nuvigil and raised.

243
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,400
No,
no one's paid me.

244
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,860
This is a,
they gave it to me for free and all uh,

245
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,440
all honesty,
but it's pretty dope razor mixed quality

246
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:10,800
products.

247
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,200
I have that big high end or high end
laptop,

248
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,980
but the blade pro and it's really good.
Is that the iphone 10 I did.

249
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:18,880
I just got the iphone tench yeah,
it took me,

250
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,070
I gave in,
I saw Jamie is,

251
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:21,904
I'm like,
I give,

252
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,940
I tapped two things about it that I
liked.

253
00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:27,090
Good face id,
a hundred percent legit,

254
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,430
hundred percent legit.
The only time it's like when you wake

255
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:32,070
up,
you know you've pillows like in the way

256
00:11:32,071 --> 00:11:35,280
or your eyes are puffy down but you just
go to the passcode.

257
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,650
But anytime you look at it,
it just unlocks,

258
00:11:37,651 --> 00:11:39,750
you know,
you can close your eyes and it won't

259
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:41,770
unlock.
So when you're sleeping you can't like

260
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,420
just put that up to your face and the
size of it.

261
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,690
Cause it's the same about the same size
as the the plus,

262
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:50,100
which is what I told that bitch.

263
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,620
But it's like having an old small phone
again.

264
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:56,530
So I was starting to get carpal tunnel
and my and my finger and my thumb from

265
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,700
the plus after awhile.
So you can just swipe up and I can get

266
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:02,290
to all of your,
um,

267
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,180
I got to all your notifications.
Yeah.

268
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,940
There's,
there's different swipe systems.

269
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,310
It shouldn't say anything other than
notification though.

270
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,820
Does he looks at it.
Oh Shit.

271
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,461
Yeah.
Yeah.

272
00:12:12,461 --> 00:12:15,040
That's the one of that.
Let me back and I was trying to cancel

273
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:18,790
it doesn't trust me.
Cancer Pitch Dilly Dally and won't let

274
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,100
me cancel it.
It's making me enter a password.

275
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,330
Cancel.
Oh there it is.

276
00:12:22,331 --> 00:12:24,730
Here's some notifications.
Now can you see anything?

277
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:27,680
Cause I'm already,
nobody wants to fake face Id.

278
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,160
Look at me.
Look at that will look,

279
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,670
I'll unlock it for you.

280
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,810
That's why.
Hold on.

281
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,630
Perfect.
Perfect example.

282
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,510
So it fucks up sometimes.
Sometimes,

283
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,430
but I'll tell you what man,
this a,

284
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:50,140
the form factor is very interesting.
That's my security camp.

285
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,550
So it's a huge ass camera,
but it's not second three or four

286
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:57,040
cameras I think.
I mean it's the shoe as huge as phone

287
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,450
rather,
but it's not a huge ass phone.

288
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,890
Right.
And it has a killer camera.

289
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,580
What a weird world man.
Just 10 years ago the first iphone came

290
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:07,600
out and if you saw that thing today,
but that thing was made out of wood.

291
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,710
I still have mine.
Do you have some amazing all mine and

292
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:14,380
two of them are starting to explode
like,

293
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:17,320
and it's not fair because I bought him
and I wanted to keep them like a

294
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:19,720
collector,
but my like iphone three is like bubbled

295
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:21,340
up and it's about to blow up any day
now.

296
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,380
So do you get used to all this
difference?

297
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,000
You have different swipes now because
you don't have a homepage.

298
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,590
Like how do you,
you have to shut it down to get out of

299
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:30,424
there.
Yeah.

300
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,660
Interesting.
Yeah.

301
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,530
If the swiping system actually is very
like,

302
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,430
I can't believe I used to do it that
different way.

303
00:13:36,431 --> 00:13:38,710
Like if you want to go in between like,
uh,

304
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,280
like programs now you just go to the on
the bottom left or right.

305
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:47,310
You know,
so you do that and then now the top

306
00:13:47,621 --> 00:13:50,380
right,
it gets you to the control center.

307
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,050
And I mean,
and it took me about two days for me to

308
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:53,920
finally go,
oh,

309
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:56,890
this is so much how it's supposed to be.
Yeah.

310
00:13:56,891 --> 00:13:57,880
Well yeah.

311
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,200
Who's figure,
you know,

312
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:01,780
like if they figure out a better way,
even though it's a better way,

313
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:02,201
like,
you know,

314
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:04,410
cordy typing,
do you know the whole deal behind that?

315
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,370
Apparently this is not the fastest way
to type like the keyboard Qwerty is set

316
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:13,450
up the way it is because in the olden
days they made it that way because old

317
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:17,200
keys would get stuck on each other and
they would mash them and they get stuck

318
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:18,790
together.
So they had a separate,

319
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,870
the more commonly used keys.
So they changed the way they did it,

320
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:25,830
but the right way to do the typewriter,
goddammit,

321
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,750
I forget the name of it,
but uh,

322
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,700
some people try wacky fucking nerds.
You wacky nerds,

323
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,140
these wacky nerds,
they touch it.

324
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,130
They take their keyboards and they
reprogrammed them or they buy a specific

325
00:14:36,131 --> 00:14:40,210
keyboard that's in this way and then
they learn how to type with this super

326
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:42,850
unusual keyboard,
but it's supposed to be fast.

327
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,890
Sure.
Here's a plug in.

328
00:14:43,891 --> 00:14:46,770
I think that you can do it on your ipad
and your iphones and stuff like that.

329
00:14:46,771 --> 00:14:47,880
They'll realize it.
Like,

330
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,720
what is it called James?
The devora Kita for act.

331
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,890
That's,
yeah,

332
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,100
it's

333
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,120
a little different layout.
Yeah.

334
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:55,370
So there's cordy and Devorah.
So yeah,

335
00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:00,490
like it's a e U I d h.
So it's not corny at all.

336
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,730
P Y F,
G,

337
00:15:02,731 --> 00:15:05,750
C R L on top.
Like what?

338
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,090
Like you would,
it would take a long ass time to

339
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:08,720
relearn.

340
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,970
You can't relearn.
You'd have to start from the beginning.

341
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,351
I don't know,
man.

342
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:15,040
I don't think it's worth it.
He just,

343
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,270
I just,
I'm too stupid.

344
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,640
I'm too stupid.
It's like my thoughts about learning a

345
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:20,420
new language.
Like,

346
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,130
well I'm good voice,
right?

347
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:26,210
Your students so much already there that
we're not going to have keyboards very

348
00:15:26,211 --> 00:15:28,730
soon anyways.
What have you heard about those google

349
00:15:28,731 --> 00:15:32,570
ear buds that you put them in and you,
they translate for you in real time?

350
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,630
Uh,
my friend has him there.

351
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,503
They,
they,

352
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,353
they,
they're not good.

353
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,850
I wasn't thinking like how could they be
good when people have like crazy flow to

354
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:41,571
their language.
Like,

355
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:43,940
you know,
you talked to like some serious Puerto

356
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:48,260
Ricans and like
there's like all these words are like

357
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:50,480
flowing into these other words,
you know,

358
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,530
I mean there's like a flavor to it that
I just don't think that little computer

359
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:56,900
thing is going to be able to figure out
what the fuck that guy just said.

360
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,820
You know,
I think you could get already do it in

361
00:15:58,821 --> 00:15:59,541
Google,
you know,

362
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,500
so you don't,
you don't need the headphones and you

363
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,690
just need your phone.
So I think in here it just does it on

364
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:07,430
speaker phone.
Okay.

365
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,170
The new Pixel,
by the way,

366
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:11,660
that camera on that,
the best camera of any,

367
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,010
any phone,
the new pixel two.

368
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,950
It's crazy is it's a single camera where
all these other phones are doing it with

369
00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:17,360
a dual camera.
It is interesting,

370
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,590
you know,
um,

371
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,360
what's really interesting is the level
that all these phones are at now,

372
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,180
it's,
everything is at a super high level.

373
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,500
Like technologically speaking,
the jump has been giant.

374
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,840
It's like where is this fucking thing
going?

375
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,610
Like where,
where are we going to look at for the

376
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:36,380
iphone 20,
you know,

377
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,180
I mean is it going to be in your skin,

378
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,020
get it?
Is it going to be aware of blindness?

379
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,330
It's going to be wearable.
I think one day there's not going to be

380
00:16:43,331 --> 00:16:44,111
a device,
a phone.

381
00:16:44,111 --> 00:16:46,210
You're just going to be wearing it
somehow.

382
00:16:46,211 --> 00:16:48,580
Like you look at your sleeve to make a
phone call.

383
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,000
You can check your email.
You're using your shoe to some mad

384
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:53,800
scientist is going to figure out a way
to make it

385
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,130
eyeballs that work better than our
eyeballs and they'll go,

386
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,080
we're going to swap out our eyeballs.
They're going to be the first to go and

387
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:04,040
swap out your eyeballs for these super
electronic eyeballs.

388
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:08,240
But everything is like a shade of color
off like red is purple.

389
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,510
They got to get it.
It's like one of them old led screens

390
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,430
and he's got burned in like we're going
to get,

391
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:15,740
we're going to figure it out.
But right now you just give up your

392
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:17,480
eyes,
you give up your eyes for the computer

393
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:19,760
world.
That's how it start us off to start us

394
00:17:19,761 --> 00:17:22,250
off with better eyes.
First it'd be our blind friends,

395
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,270
uh,
pro,

396
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,931
uh,
blind friends.

397
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:25,580
We'll get new eyes and they're like,
dude,

398
00:17:25,581 --> 00:17:28,580
I see so much better.
I'm actually happy that I went blind.

399
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:30,560
Like,
what the fuck did you just say?

400
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,190
And then next thing you know,
you're going to try it.

401
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,300
There's going to be some someone,
some crazy fucker with good eyesight is

402
00:17:37,301 --> 00:17:38,600
going to go,
I want to be able to see better.

403
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,560
It's like the girl with a perfect body
that gets boob implants like,

404
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,660
no,
how'd you do that?

405
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,840
You know,
the girl already has double d's and goes

406
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:48,890
to like AAA.
He like,

407
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,760
no,
no,

408
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,070
no,

409
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,903
no,
no.

410
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,720
Why did you do that?
It's interesting.

411
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,980
It's interesting to think of like all
the blind people would be the first ones

412
00:17:57,981 --> 00:18:00,590
to get all the new eyeballs and be
seeing better.

413
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,780
So they're all going to be like those
people with the glasses,

414
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,250
the blind people,
and they take off their,

415
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,940
and they're all robots like they live
with the movie they live.

416
00:18:07,941 --> 00:18:10,490
Remember that Rowdy Roddy Piper recipes,
respect.

417
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:14,360
Remember when Rowdy Roddy Piper was a
movie star for a little bit doing some

418
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:17,710
action movies and he was like one of the
first guys like the rock to break

419
00:18:17,711 --> 00:18:19,580
through,
you know,

420
00:18:19,581 --> 00:18:21,290
and uh,
that day live movie.

421
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,600
That was fun.
I miss that guy,

422
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,261
dude.
This is,

423
00:18:24,261 --> 00:18:26,540
it's a real possibility that this could
happen.

424
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,100
Like this is not a,
I mean,

425
00:18:28,101 --> 00:18:30,110
I'm not saying it's going to happen in,
in a decade,

426
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:33,050
but if human beings live to be another
hundred years,

427
00:18:33,051 --> 00:18:36,140
we're going to find they're going to
have better replacements to tweet about

428
00:18:36,141 --> 00:18:36,350
that.

429
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,260
A robot was scared.
Everybody just the way he worded it,

430
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,880
he said,
this is nothing in a few years,

431
00:18:40,881 --> 00:18:43,670
that Bot will move so fast.
You need a strobe light to see it.

432
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:48,500
Sweet dreams.
Oh fuck that guy.

433
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,880
So awesome.
The shit out of me.

434
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,740
But he's right.
Listen man,

435
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:54,970
he's probably one of the smartest human
beings on the planet earth that guys,

436
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,350
you know that they think he might have
invented bitcoin.

437
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,660
There's a lot of speculation online.
You know what?

438
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,400
Here's the thing,
I want to talk about this and this

439
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:03,170
podcast.
I didn't even read the article.

440
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,600
I looked at the headline,
I'm like probably,

441
00:19:05,601 --> 00:19:07,070
and I kept moving.
He started paypal,

442
00:19:07,071 --> 00:19:09,530
right?
I didn't hit him like Peter Teal started

443
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,100
paying.
Yeah,

444
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,960
I believe so.
I believe that's what like made him and

445
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:19,250
there was a video of him from like the
1990s where he got like a million dollar

446
00:19:19,251 --> 00:19:20,084
car delivered.

447
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,630
Like it was just starting to ball and
he's just starting to ball out of

448
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:25,640
control.
He's probably like one of the smartest

449
00:19:25,641 --> 00:19:28,430
human beings ever.
And he sports car though.

450
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,070
There's Tesla.
He's a fascinating guy,

451
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:31,761
man.
Do you know?

452
00:19:31,761 --> 00:19:34,520
He just like made a whole town out of
like a battery,

453
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,530
like a term.
He made like the biggest battery in the

454
00:19:36,531 --> 00:19:39,560
history of the world.
Did you hear about that one?

455
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,660
Yeah.
They just isn't some new thing that he

456
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:45,890
just built.
They just built the largest battery in

457
00:19:45,891 --> 00:19:48,440
the history of the world.
It's like a building.

458
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,410
Like this guy is fucking Nikola Tesla.
We're going to be some madman.

459
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,380
We're going to have battery explosions
in the future.

460
00:19:57,381 --> 00:19:59,270
That's going to be a big thing for sure.
Now,

461
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,100
right?
Like this whole town's going to go up.

462
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:05,180
A Tesla has built the world's largest
battery in Australia.

463
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,130
What in the fuck tech and Leon Musk.
Elon.

464
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,280
Elon musk is making good on his promise
to solve energy,

465
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,280
an energy crisis in Australia.
Can you make that bear

466
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,353
okay.

467
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,720
Besides,
um,

468
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,400
screw that up.
Oh,

469
00:20:21,401 --> 00:20:23,710
here it goes.
It's fully installed.

470
00:20:23,711 --> 00:20:26,530
The world's largest lithium ion battery
in South Australia.

471
00:20:26,531 --> 00:20:28,420
The state government said in a statement
Thursday,

472
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,530
Tesla teamed up with a French renewable
energy from and a local government to

473
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:36,460
install the battery,
which must promise to deliver within a

474
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,440
hundred days of signing the contract or
it would be free.

475
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,010
He's crazy,
but he did as a crisis.

476
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,020
He's,
he's a mad man.

477
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,110
He's like,
I'm fucking mad scientist from a,

478
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,400
he's like a guy from a movie,
right?

479
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:55,600
Like if you had a movie and there was
some mad billionaire Robert Downey

480
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:59,140
junior type character that just kept
invented the newest crazy shit and was

481
00:20:59,141 --> 00:21:01,720
at the cutting edge of science and was
telling everybody to look out for the

482
00:21:01,721 --> 00:21:06,721
fucking robots are going to kill us.
It would be Elon Musk and let him know

483
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,530
the comedy show one night.

484
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,840
I was panicking.
He watched you though,

485
00:21:10,841 --> 00:21:12,320
right?
I think he,

486
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,610
I think he did.
He had a nice army with them.

487
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,090
Yeah.
I bring a lot of money with guns can

488
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,470
move very good.
Especially if you're worried about

489
00:21:20,471 --> 00:21:22,750
robots.
Fuck man.

490
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:24,580
He's right though.
That's the scary thing.

491
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:28,060
When you watch that one robot,
there's one mini robot is this little

492
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:32,680
yellow one in this video and it's
running on the ground and like a very

493
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:34,150
fast rate and you're like,
wait,

494
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:34,984
wait,
wait.

495
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,910
Like you're trying to wrap your head
around this thing.

496
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:38,830
Like what is this thing has guns?
What?

497
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:42,370
It's got a little camera and it's got
guns and it's running at you like this

498
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,750
and it's like the size of a 44 magnum.
It's like a series of 44 magnums pointed

499
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:49,630
at you.
It's about that big and it's running.

500
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,090
I'll go a hundred times faster than you
could ever run.

501
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,250
Like what?
Oh God.

502
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,560
This is like probably how people in
Yemen feel like,

503
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,690
yes,
I've been telling you you can't,

504
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,710
you can't let them use robots.
You know like the people that get bombed

505
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,630
with drones,
we've just sorta like,

506
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,440
that's not real.
You don't even have to Blake,

507
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,870
tell us about it.
No one has to tell us that they're going

508
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:15,490
to do it.
They just do it right.

509
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,480
And something like 80% of the people
that they kill her innocent.

510
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,450
There's some crazy number of people that
the drones of Kilt,

511
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:26,140
I know we've gone over this before.
What is it like 80% do you remember?

512
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,680
That sounds about right.
It's some,

513
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,570
let's see if we can find it.
Just cause it's so,

514
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,330
I know you're a guru.
Can you were in surgery to get it

515
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,150
probably might be like 78% whatever it
is,

516
00:22:37,151 --> 00:22:41,020
but it's even if it's more than 50%
that's fucking crazy.

517
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,710
We just have robots that shoot things at
people and we hope we get the right

518
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:46,960
ones.
You would never think that transformers

519
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,070
like what actually happened one day
we're going to have like good

520
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:55,130
transformers and bad transformers.
Good ones are going to hack the badger

521
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,880
ones or vice versa.
Michael Bay was right all along.

522
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,340
God,
we need to bring Megan Fox back into the

523
00:23:00,341 --> 00:23:02,550
franchise.
What I just,

524
00:23:02,551 --> 00:23:06,430
that's hard to imagine man,
but it's probably inevitable,

525
00:23:06,431 --> 00:23:08,460
right?
It's probably inevitable that someone is

526
00:23:08,461 --> 00:23:11,890
going to make some super smart robot
that does his bidding and this and we're

527
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:15,880
going to have like a war of worlds and
we're going to have robo cops fight the

528
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:16,840
bad robots.

529
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:20,260
Drones.
You imagine if the argument would be

530
00:23:20,261 --> 00:23:23,620
let's let the robots fight because
therefore it'll save human lives will

531
00:23:23,621 --> 00:23:28,621
dictate how the world is one sort of
just like the Olympics but with robots

532
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,170
fighting to the death to see who gets to
run the world.

533
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,600
I'm like Elon must,
should be doing instead of making

534
00:23:34,601 --> 00:23:36,850
batteries is trying to invent force
fields.

535
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,880
You know like for real we need on the
personal force fields,

536
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,190
we'll see he's,
this is the thing,

537
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:47,220
he is at the cutting edge of science and
in terms of like implementation of all

538
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:53,981
these new inventions like lithium ion
batteries that are hooked up to a giant

539
00:23:55,371 --> 00:23:56,070
fucking

540
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:59,730
whatever that structure was committed.
Then drone raise this one on Espn all

541
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:04,731
the time they pee do to put on like a
almost a Vr headset and race through it.

542
00:24:04,891 --> 00:24:06,560
They did have him in arenas.
It's crazy.

543
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:10,260
A lot of times it's at night with lit up
like neon obstacles they're going to go

544
00:24:10,261 --> 00:24:11,910
through and you'd be like 70 miles an
hour.

545
00:24:11,911 --> 00:24:13,860
I think they go really fast.
So cool.

546
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,000
That's incredible.

547
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:18,910
That's so much cooler than a video game.
Cause this is an actual thing out there

548
00:24:18,911 --> 00:24:22,120
that you're moving around,
you know like to play a video game.

549
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:26,770
Like that's the new video game.
The new video game is you put some like

550
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:31,830
10 k camera Vr headset thing on and you
put these cameras on these robots and

551
00:24:35,591 --> 00:24:39,520
then you go do shit where the actual
thing is really doing it.

552
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,500
It's not valid.
It's not a video.

553
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,790
You're just watching some real physical
thing take place.

554
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:49,630
And then you have these physical wars.
So like instead of,

555
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,960
you know like if you built together an
army of semi indestructable robots,

556
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,280
right?
And you had to duke it out with another

557
00:24:57,281 --> 00:25:02,281
army of semi indestructable robots and
that would be like a television show or

558
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:06,520
drone laser tag where it's like star
wars and you're fighting and if you have

559
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:09,130
you shoot your laser at it,
like turns off the drone.

560
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,440
It doesn't destroy it.
Maybe it makes it fake.

561
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,630
Yeah,
but you'd have to have high stakes.

562
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,180
See,
I think things would be so cheap back by

563
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,940
the time it gets to this point.
It's like everything gets cheaper and

564
00:25:18,941 --> 00:25:19,840
cheaper.
Like you used to be,

565
00:25:19,841 --> 00:25:24,280
like you had to be a super baller to
have that Michael Douglas brick on the

566
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:25,180
beach.
Right?

567
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,190
Remember when the movie greed or
whatever it was,

568
00:25:27,191 --> 00:25:29,890
Wall Street greed is good.
He's walking with that giant brick.

569
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,290
Like you had to be a super ball or to be
able to afford that.

570
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,160
But now that's like nothing and everyone
has a cell phone that's way better than

571
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:38,680
that.
Like every person walking down the

572
00:25:38,681 --> 00:25:40,600
street you can serve.
Do you have a fallen on you?

573
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,261
Yes,
I do.

574
00:25:41,261 --> 00:25:43,420
And he pulls out his phone.
It's way better than Michael Douglas's.

575
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:48,570
Super baller all time.
High money guy cell phone here except

576
00:25:49,921 --> 00:25:50,430
ours.
But Ari,

577
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,090
he hasn't said No.
Ari's phone,

578
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,770
it's still way better.
Right?

579
00:25:53,771 --> 00:25:56,620
It's still way better than that stupid
piece of shit that Michael Douglas had.

580
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,740
So if we just keep going in that
direction,

581
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:02,170
they're going to get cheaper and cheaper
and cheaper to do crazier and crazier

582
00:26:02,171 --> 00:26:02,470
things.

583
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:05,500
You remember this movie that came out a
few years ago with Hugh Jackman?

584
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,970
Oh yeah,
they had fights.

585
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,590
What is it?
It's called real steel.

586
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,570
It's like rock 'em sock.
'Em robots.

587
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:12,820
How did they,
how did they,

588
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,740
uh,
did they do it with like remote control

589
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:15,910
where almost like what you're
describing,

590
00:26:15,911 --> 00:26:19,570
there's some capturing their body
movement and that just re like copies

591
00:26:19,571 --> 00:26:22,240
what they do.
And really it also is ai and has

592
00:26:22,241 --> 00:26:23,770
feelings.
I don't know how dumb was it?

593
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,090
Wait a minute.
He's on the ground.

594
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,720
How's he fighting?
Was it someone else doing it and then

595
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:30,400
he's going to go back in there.
Oh God,

596
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:31,270
he did the thing with the,

597
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,220
oh no,
he's going to,

598
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,630
is it training?
Montage.

599
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:40,450
Stop this.
Don't you rode Wolverine Jolt.

600
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:45,120
You root for,
don't you ruin Wolverine from me?

601
00:26:45,121 --> 00:26:47,580
You piece of shit.
Sorry.

602
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,810
I got dumped in that look.
Oh,

603
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:53,850
that's so sad.
He's going to show the little boy,

604
00:26:53,851 --> 00:26:55,050
the little boy and tells him,
Hey,

605
00:26:55,051 --> 00:26:57,810
come on man.
You gotta get in there and when for us

606
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,760
it pulls the sunglasses down.
Well,

607
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,170
I'm going to have to start training,
which I took it.

608
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,310
Did Anybody Watch that movie?
I don't know.

609
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,910
That's why I don't,
don't know much about it.

610
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,070
They must've gave him Hugh Jackman.
Oh Shit.

611
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,350
A lot of money to make that look like a
good idea.

612
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,330
He had to be sitting in his house in
Australia.

613
00:27:15,331 --> 00:27:15,900
Going,
how?

614
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,860
When?
How much again?

615
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,750
How much?
Okay,

616
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,090
okay,
so I'm a fighter robot guy.

617
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,220
Is that what's going on?
How many weeks?

618
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,350
I watched it on an airplane.
No sound.

619
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,200
That's about it.
That's what you do when you're so high.

620
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:30,120
You're thinking you got to fall out of
the sky.

621
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,900
They'd watch that and go,
what?

622
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,870
That guy's awesome as wolverine.
Even though he's not supposed to like is

623
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:39,900
not supposed to look like that.
Wolverines not supposed to be a big guy.

624
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,150
That would be like a bear hug.
We'll run.

625
00:27:42,151 --> 00:27:47,151
It's like a little little blockhead guy.
Wolverine would be built like um,

626
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,980
you'd have to go like who?
Samar Paul Horez.

627
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,160
Perfect example.
Who some are.

628
00:27:55,161 --> 00:27:57,690
Paul Harris is a guy who fought in the
UFC.

629
00:27:57,691 --> 00:28:00,780
He got,
he got kicked out of the UFC for I think

630
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:02,810
unjustly.
He's got it.

631
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:05,580
He's,
he holds on to submissions too long and

632
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:08,550
people get really mad at him cause he
fucking mangles people's legs.

633
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:12,510
But I think the last one,
like east the people are they out there

634
00:28:12,511 --> 00:28:16,290
on him so hard that I think the last one
was just,

635
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,930
it was a tiny minor infraction.

636
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,860
I think he's just get super excited and
I think he's definitely held on to

637
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:25,320
things too long in the past,
but I think he's learned from that.

638
00:28:25,321 --> 00:28:27,990
But anyway,
the UFC as a zero tolerance policy for

639
00:28:27,991 --> 00:28:29,670
that shit.
He doesn't fight for the UFC anymore.

640
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,820
I get it.
But my point is the guy looked like

641
00:28:32,821 --> 00:28:36,390
wolverine from the comic book.
He's just fucking jacked.

642
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,600
He was like this five foot eight,
five foot nine.

643
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:43,320
He might not even been that tall,
hundred 85 pound goal.

644
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:48,000
Willa just ripping people's legs apart.
He was one of the scariest guys hour.

645
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:51,090
See if he can find a good picture of who
some are.

646
00:28:51,091 --> 00:28:55,680
Paul Hi-rez just try Pahara it's,
there's no way I'm spelling who some are

647
00:28:55,681 --> 00:28:58,980
correctly.
It's who some are within our reach in my

648
00:28:58,981 --> 00:29:00,170
area.
Yeah.

649
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,700
It's,
it's spelled with an r,

650
00:29:01,701 --> 00:29:02,780
but the,
the porch.

651
00:29:02,781 --> 00:29:03,614
A gay,
see,

652
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,050
please use,
uh,

653
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,530
these h they call me Joe Hogan.

654
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,000
Joe Hogan.
There he is right there.

655
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,380
Jesus Christ,
man.

656
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,330
Wow.
Look at that fucking picture.

657
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:13,680
We kind of jacked.
He is,

658
00:29:13,681 --> 00:29:16,050
man.
That's what wolverine is supposed to

659
00:29:16,051 --> 00:29:18,210
look like,
if the almost exactly like that.

660
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,140
Just so like super jacked pit bull of a
man,

661
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,380
because that's what a wolverine is.
A wolverine.

662
00:29:24,381 --> 00:29:27,510
It's a crazy fucking animal.
He's still fighting to get the size of

663
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:29,580
that guy is,
he's still fight.

664
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,060
He got fucked up a few times and some
other organizations,

665
00:29:33,061 --> 00:29:36,390
he got beaten by some tough guys.
Like a meal,

666
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,210
meat meal.
A meal.

667
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:40,080
Meek.
Sorry,

668
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,370
I'm saying his name wrong.
Amil Meek,

669
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,150
the mad viking dude.
He fucked him up and that,

670
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,520
that's what got him over into the UFC.

671
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,940
That's like a Gi Joe Body.
Yeah.

672
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,800
Yeah.
He's ridiculous.

673
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,530
Um,
but that's what if like wolverine was a

674
00:29:58,531 --> 00:30:00,000
human,
that's what he'd looked like.

675
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,930
Wouldn't look like Hugh Jackman but you
Jackman pulls it off.

676
00:30:03,931 --> 00:30:06,990
Like you don't have to be totally,
I'm can you kind of get a movie star in

677
00:30:06,991 --> 00:30:09,030
there?
It's not like let Paul Horez play

678
00:30:09,031 --> 00:30:11,430
Wolverine.
Like Wolverine has to say a bunch of

679
00:30:11,431 --> 00:30:12,960
Shit and you got to believe you means
it,

680
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,920
you know?
So it was probably hard to find like a

681
00:30:16,921 --> 00:30:21,921
super jacked movie star who could be a
savage unless it's jack man who

682
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:24,840
jacqueline could be a savage.
I'm buying it.

683
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:28,710
I got my t levels results today.
How's everything going?

684
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,490
I don't know what it means,
but I'm in the normal range.

685
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,710
Like here's the,
that there's like the normal range.

686
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,990
You have a chart.
We had a doctor I just spent,

687
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,310
I spent,
I use this every,

688
00:30:38,311 --> 00:30:42,390
well every well thing and he spit in his
little thing and like two weeks you'd

689
00:30:42,391 --> 00:30:43,570
get like full graph.

690
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:48,570
That's like 24 and me.
But for you and 24 it's 24 hours.

691
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,510
But like I showed you,
like I,

692
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:55,350
I'm on the low side of normal,
but so I don't even know what that

693
00:30:55,351 --> 00:30:57,780
means.
And I guess I should test it every

694
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,730
couple of months to see if it bounces up
and down.

695
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:03,300
But I definitely have lower normal.
Well,

696
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,570
you could fix that.
I know I,

697
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,000
but here's the thing you should do.
Like if you,

698
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,750
you really,
you really like we have in a

699
00:31:09,751 --> 00:31:11,220
conversation about health.
No,

700
00:31:11,221 --> 00:31:13,140
I mean I'm just checking my t levels,
bro.

701
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,273
I know,
bro.

702
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,700
It's all connected.
What I'm saying is that I guarantee you

703
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,480
if you just changed your diet,
it would have a significant effect on

704
00:31:21,481 --> 00:31:23,850
that just changed your diet.
I'm going to go to,

705
00:31:23,851 --> 00:31:26,430
I'm going to do this new thing.
If you want to do it with me all through

706
00:31:26,431 --> 00:31:28,860
December,
December,

707
00:31:28,861 --> 00:31:30,320
discipline,
this is what I'm gonna do.

708
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:33,150
I'm going to work out five days a week
at least.

709
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,650
Minimum.
I owe five days a week.

710
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,910
No bread,
no wheat,

711
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,380
no pasta,
no sugar.

712
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,930
All month.
Two drinks a week.

713
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,120
Geez,
that's it.

714
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,053
Okay.

715
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,020
So if you go out,
have a drink wine,

716
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,960
you get one more of those in a week.
So what are you going to eat?

717
00:31:48,961 --> 00:31:51,390
Mostly just stake healthy food,
man.

718
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:54,540
I watched another week document or on
the plane,

719
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,800
shit,
my fucking pants.

720
00:31:55,801 --> 00:31:58,650
I was terrified.
It was talking about the stuff that's in

721
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:03,651
roundup and how it's only supposed to
affect bacteria and they're the

722
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:05,340
scientists in this documentary like,
yeah,

723
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:09,030
but you have bacteria in your gut.
Like they're not taking that into

724
00:32:09,031 --> 00:32:11,070
consideration.
They're not taking into consideration

725
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,680
gut flora.
And they were talking about how many

726
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:17,850
people are having issues because they're
eating bread that has pesticides on.

727
00:32:17,851 --> 00:32:18,684
I'm like,
okay,

728
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,570
is this like some pseudoscience shit?
Is this some nonsense?

729
00:32:21,571 --> 00:32:24,180
Like I got to get to it and eventually I
will,

730
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:29,450
but I can't imagine that stuff that
kills bacteria would be good for you.

731
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,220
I just can't imagine.
I don't know how much of that you would

732
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:35,550
actually wind up having in your body,
but how the fuck could that be good for

733
00:32:35,551 --> 00:32:36,384
you?

734
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:41,120
Like all that roundup that's,
that should scare the fuck out of you.

735
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,760
What is going on there?
Man,

736
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,060
you know,
I,

737
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,760
we sure we share.
That's okay.

738
00:32:46,761 --> 00:32:47,750
For you,
like one of those things,

739
00:32:47,751 --> 00:32:51,590
there's a certain amount that's
allowable per probably,

740
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:56,060
but who set that standard and is that
standard been updated based on what you

741
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:58,400
know,
like there's too much money involved in

742
00:32:58,401 --> 00:33:00,800
all this stuff.
You have to realize like anything that's

743
00:33:00,801 --> 00:33:03,680
going to slow down the money when it
comes to in his old bro,

744
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:05,600
you couldn't talk and conspiracies.
But no,

745
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,090
like for real,
this is important when it comes to

746
00:33:08,091 --> 00:33:10,550
environmental regulations.
If you look at the fight,

747
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,010
here's a Ryko super good point.
When it comes to this,

748
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,880
if you look at the fight when it comes
to environmental regulations,

749
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:22,870
who the fuck would be arguing against
preserving the environment to stop,

750
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,270
stop and think about how crazy these
conversations have to be where someone

751
00:33:30,271 --> 00:33:30,771
saying,
Hey,

752
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:33,830
no,
you can't dig that oil well right next

753
00:33:33,831 --> 00:33:37,130
to this river because it'll kill
everything in the river.

754
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:40,970
You fucking cunts.
And the people still wind up doing it

755
00:33:40,971 --> 00:33:42,520
somehow.
Like how it,

756
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,200
how is that conversation even taking
place that we're,

757
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:49,160
we're in,
we're getting involved in doing things

758
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:53,450
that we know for sure is going to have
some consequence and we're willing to

759
00:33:53,451 --> 00:33:57,020
accept a certain amount of it.
Some consequence on the natural world

760
00:33:57,021 --> 00:34:00,050
around it might,
you might just the keystone pipeline,

761
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:02,900
just,
just the other day release 200,000

762
00:34:02,901 --> 00:34:05,120
gallons of oil a little bit.
Just a little bit.

763
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,780
Just a little bit.
Whoops.

764
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:08,690
House bill.
Want to fix?

765
00:34:08,691 --> 00:34:10,430
This is what we're trying to fix this
thing.

766
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:16,690
Whoa.
Like we should be like before we agree

767
00:34:16,911 --> 00:34:18,290
to anything,
right?

768
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,900
I guess,
I guess there's gotta be some trade off,

769
00:34:20,901 --> 00:34:22,760
right?
If you want to do a big city and you

770
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:25,370
want to have all this power,
like there's gotta be some sort of

771
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:28,070
environmental consequences at this stage
of the life.

772
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,650
Is that at this stage of,
of people like the way we're running

773
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:34,910
things and has elan musk can make us
those big ass batteries everywhere.

774
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,160
It's solar power collectors,
man.

775
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,390
Like,
like lh.

776
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:42,530
Every building should be required to
have solar collectors on them in la.

777
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,840
No Shit.
And it's not that crazy expensive,

778
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:47,960
like it's not that you could do it
yourself on Amazon prime,

779
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,520
prime dropping,
that's for sure.

780
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,020
It's dropping.
You know,

781
00:34:51,021 --> 00:34:53,660
they make some things where you can like
charge your phone.

782
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:56,870
Like they make these a solar panels.
Like you could sit them out on your

783
00:34:56,871 --> 00:35:01,130
patio.
It collects a electricity enough to you

784
00:35:01,131 --> 00:35:03,290
take it with you the next day.
You could charge your phone with it,

785
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,620
you charge your laptop with it.
They like backpacks that have solar on

786
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:07,770
it.
She got to be like,

787
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,050
why the sunniest places should have be
required to do shit like that.

788
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,910
You know,
in the windiest places should have

789
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:16,070
windmills.
And what I've read is,

790
00:35:16,071 --> 00:35:21,071
the only issue on any of this stuff is
where are the minerals coming from to

791
00:35:21,171 --> 00:35:23,720
make these magnets?
You know,

792
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:27,560
there's things called conflict minerals.
There's minerals that are,

793
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:30,740
you know,
taken out of the ground in the Congo by

794
00:35:30,741 --> 00:35:32,090
slaves.
You know,

795
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:37,120
there's little children working in these
camps that they've documented polling,

796
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:40,470
I think it's called [inaudible] Tan,
that's the name of it.

797
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,440
Out of the mountains and stuff.
They used to make cell phones.

798
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,860
It's very depressing and I don't know if
they still do it there like that

799
00:35:46,861 --> 00:35:48,450
anymore.
I don't know if since uh,

800
00:35:48,451 --> 00:35:50,700
it's been exposed,
it's had any sort of an impact on how

801
00:35:50,701 --> 00:35:51,990
they do it.
But um,

802
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:55,110
Shane Smith was the first person that
talked to us about it and I remember

803
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,530
talking to him about it going,
Whoa,

804
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,720
wait a minute.

805
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:02,430
Like stop and think about like what a
cell phone is like your flip that bitch

806
00:36:02,431 --> 00:36:04,590
overseen.
I have to stare at your notifications.

807
00:36:04,591 --> 00:36:06,690
Everybody so scarce,
not be connected,

808
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,650
but you know,
he,

809
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,810
if you just think about the,
the pinnacle of like what we use as far

810
00:36:12,811 --> 00:36:14,520
as like technology is like one of those
things,

811
00:36:14,521 --> 00:36:16,500
right?
And if you take that,

812
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:20,070
which is like the most pervasive
technology,

813
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,530
the most advanced aspect of our society,
right?

814
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,560
The Internet in a phone that takes
pictures and you can ironically connect

815
00:36:28,831 --> 00:36:33,831
that all the way back to a child slave
that's digging rocks out of the ground

816
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:36,870
with a stick.
Whoa,

817
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:41,010
that's dark.
I used to do it as a kid.

818
00:36:41,011 --> 00:36:42,390
It was fun.
You've mined minerals.

819
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,400
I mean,
I would just take it out of the Congo

820
00:36:44,401 --> 00:36:46,860
that malaria is digging in my backyard,
get rocks.

821
00:36:46,861 --> 00:36:48,470
I collected rocks,
polished him.

822
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,730
It was fine.
I love doing that.

823
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,490
Yeah.
I met a dude once who pan for gold.

824
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,580
We were coming across the country and
uh,

825
00:36:56,581 --> 00:37:01,581
I met a dude who was a legitimate
prospector and he was not making a ton

826
00:37:01,891 --> 00:37:04,260
of money,
but he had like this idea that he could

827
00:37:04,261 --> 00:37:08,700
at any day like go in one of these
rivers and pull out some serious gold.

828
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,500
It happens.
It does happen,

829
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:13,290
especially like in Alaska.
There's those TV shows where it's in

830
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:15,940
Alaska where there's these guys go and
they,

831
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:20,130
they get a certain amount of gold out of
the ground every day and sometimes they

832
00:37:20,131 --> 00:37:24,420
hit good pots and they can really,
really collect and stack them up.

833
00:37:24,421 --> 00:37:26,430
But this dude was just like,
and that brought him some shit that I

834
00:37:26,431 --> 00:37:27,420
thought it was gold and like,
dude,

835
00:37:27,421 --> 00:37:28,320
I found some gold.
He's like,

836
00:37:28,321 --> 00:37:28,531
no,
no,

837
00:37:28,531 --> 00:37:29,970
no.
That's pyrite.

838
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:33,070
That's fool's gold.
And I started thinking about,

839
00:37:33,071 --> 00:37:33,904
it was like,
well,

840
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:37,270
why is gold worth anything?
I come,

841
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,050
this pretty stuff was not as much as
that pretty stuff.

842
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:43,620
Like what the fuck is fool's gold might
be worth more than gold.

843
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:47,010
One some day we will like you fools.
It was right there in front of your eyes

844
00:37:47,011 --> 00:37:49,020
the entire time.
Natalie,

845
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:52,830
what is fool's gold made out of?
Fool's gold looks pretty dope.

846
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,820
I think I should have some shit made out
of fool's gold since I'm a fool.

847
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:00,470
That's good move.
We should make it happen Bro.

848
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,140
How dope would it be to have a fool's
gold watch movement?

849
00:38:04,141 --> 00:38:06,570
Get on that shit.
Rolex with pass.

850
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:11,840
Imagine a dope ass fools gold chain.
Why not?

851
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,230
It's pretty like,
it's weird how like some shit is like

852
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,410
worth a lot of money that's pretty and
some shit like we don't give a fuck

853
00:38:22,411 --> 00:38:24,480
about rubies.
The only thing that's coming up as the

854
00:38:24,481 --> 00:38:26,340
Matthew mcconaughey movie called fools
gold,

855
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:30,930
it's him and the girl on a bottle of
wine on the page and there's a lot of

856
00:38:30,931 --> 00:38:31,681
singing.
Wait,

857
00:38:31,681 --> 00:38:34,710
this flows go to actually exist or is
this something we've always thought it

858
00:38:34,711 --> 00:38:36,110
was you described.
That's

859
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,800
beautiful.
And the watch that he's wearing,

860
00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:39,670
his keeps popping up

861
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,340
and they both have their crotches
leaning towards each other.

862
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,820
They do.
They do look at the shadow works.

863
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,400
They're like moving in on the deep dick
and right there.

864
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:52,720
Just real close

865
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:55,900
actually vaguely remember that he just
like a pirate treasure hunter I think.

866
00:38:55,901 --> 00:38:58,600
Have you ever seen anybody do that or
heard of people that do that?

867
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,330
They like find a place and they can't
tell anybody about it cause they know

868
00:39:01,331 --> 00:39:04,780
there's probably like $2 million worth
of shit down there and they got to be

869
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:08,050
careful because those are real kill him.
Oh yeah.

870
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,060
That shit is real.
Yeah.

871
00:39:10,061 --> 00:39:13,270
There's a whole industry of that and
there's people that finance these guys.

872
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:16,840
See there's the mad men that know where
the fuck and mad women's are and non

873
00:39:16,841 --> 00:39:20,170
binary folk that know where the treasure
might be.

874
00:39:20,171 --> 00:39:24,130
And then there's the people that need to
finance that bitch and usually they make

875
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:25,750
some sort of a split.
Like the guy's like,

876
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:27,660
hey,
I'll invest and people have invested

877
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:31,840
hundreds of millions of dollars and come
up with Zilch and they just think around

878
00:39:31,841 --> 00:39:33,460
the corner,
around the corner.

879
00:39:33,461 --> 00:39:36,810
It's got to be my pot of gold,
a Roman ship that crashed.

880
00:39:36,811 --> 00:39:39,580
Just fill to the fucking brim.
Those greedy cons,

881
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:42,700
these to bring so much gold with them
that it killed their boat,

882
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:48,300
poison them from the inside.
Imagine that he just got hundreds and

883
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,170
hundreds of pounds of gold.

884
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,070
There's another movie,
he an acts that came out last year

885
00:39:54,071 --> 00:39:58,690
that's sort of about it to where he goes
to somewhere like Thailand and they're

886
00:39:58,691 --> 00:40:00,310
like,
they know the spot where they're

887
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,460
prospectors are going to like dig all
the gold out of the out of the mountains

888
00:40:03,461 --> 00:40:05,560
and demanding thing,
but it's not a in the ocean.

889
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,110
Pretty Dope wasn't as good.
You know what was good

890
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:10,770
that I liked a lot of people did not
like the dark tower.

891
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,380
Oh yeah,
it's not good.

892
00:40:13,381 --> 00:40:15,150
Right?
That Idris Elba Guy,

893
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,670
he could sell me anything.
I'm buying it.

894
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,530
He's,
he's like,

895
00:40:19,531 --> 00:40:23,210
he's a guy that's like you believe is
like a legit Badass.

896
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:27,300
But also can act like the,
like I believed him in this movie.

897
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:30,180
He was a wacky movie.
It's like very wacky.

898
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:32,460
It's always whacking.
When you have a Stephen King book,

899
00:40:32,461 --> 00:40:34,910
he tried to make a movie out of it.
So you have a British accent?

900
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,190
No,
not quite,

901
00:40:38,191 --> 00:40:42,690
but he has like some sort of a noble
accent like the way talks,

902
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,650
you know like I do not aim with my hand
to aim with your hand,

903
00:40:46,651 --> 00:40:49,350
just to forget the face of your father.
That kind of shit.

904
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,090
You know?
It was like intense,

905
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,850
weird world that they live in,
in this movie.

906
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:54,900
It's very strange.

907
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,820
But I enjoy the shit out of it.
You know?

908
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:59,370
Cause you,
when you watch a movie that's a Stephen

909
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:01,320
King book,
you got to realize they have to

910
00:41:01,321 --> 00:41:05,310
abbreviate the fuck out of this.
Like this is a complex story that gets

911
00:41:05,311 --> 00:41:10,311
woven into all these different places
and you've got to condense that to an

912
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:13,440
hour and a half to make it palatable for
movie.

913
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,420
It just use,
it was very hard to do.

914
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:19,350
Like I those,
it's almost like game of thrones have

915
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:22,470
made movies obsolete.
It's like movies or like clunky.

916
00:41:22,471 --> 00:41:25,860
They're like cds,
like why Karen had cds do you don't have

917
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:27,360
a phone?
Like who are you?

918
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,900
I I think the same way about game of
thrones.

919
00:41:29,901 --> 00:41:32,630
I can't get into it.
I'm like,

920
00:41:32,631 --> 00:41:33,980
God damn.
I'd rather watch.

921
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,810
Fuck you.
Fuck you man.

922
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,640
I heard that.
The punisher,

923
00:41:37,641 --> 00:41:39,270
the Guy John Byrne,
dawn,

924
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:42,830
I said his last name,
he said that it gets a 13 episode movie.

925
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:45,440
I got 13 hour movie.
It's how it's supposed to be watched or

926
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,360
sorta.
That makes sense.

927
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,550
That makes sense.
That guy's a good fucking actor.

928
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,090
That guy was great in the walking dead.
He was fucking great.

929
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:56,480
As the best friend wants to fuck the
wife and then turns into a Zombie.

930
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,100
She blow.
Are you still watching that?

931
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,850
No.
I gave up man.

932
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,060
I gave up.
No.

933
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,890
I read people getting mad about
episodes.

934
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,381
I'm like,
no,

935
00:42:04,381 --> 00:42:04,541
no,
no,

936
00:42:04,541 --> 00:42:06,980
no.
What shows are you watching right now?

937
00:42:06,981 --> 00:42:09,020
Like what's some,
what's some shows like you would never

938
00:42:09,021 --> 00:42:11,390
think like just like a reality show or
like,

939
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,750
I don't watch anything like that,
but I do watch ozark.

940
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,310
That's,
that's the shit.

941
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,780
That's a,
that Netflix show,

942
00:42:17,781 --> 00:42:21,020
ozarks or Ozar goes dark,
just hose artist.

943
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,360
Um,
that's awesome.

944
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,760
Which then stranger things,
Ozark is a like,

945
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,110
I don't want to give too much of it
away,

946
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:30,260
but it's Jason Bateman and it's this,
it's,

947
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,160
it's like a,
it's like a drama,

948
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:35,600
but like,
uh,

949
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:38,570
based on like financial shit,
that's all I want to give away.

950
00:42:38,571 --> 00:42:42,170
I don't want to give away anything,
but it's fucking crazy good.

951
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:45,260
It's really good and it's fucking wild
man.

952
00:42:45,261 --> 00:42:48,020
Like wild shit happens in this show.
And you're like,

953
00:42:48,021 --> 00:42:51,860
what the fuck?
I don't want to give away too much of

954
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,540
it,
but it's about money laundering and the

955
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:58,370
guy's like a legit financier financier
and he gets himself in a bad situation.

956
00:42:58,371 --> 00:43:01,790
It's fucking good show man.
And that show got me.

957
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,950
I watch like the last five episodes all
in a row.

958
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,940
That's a good fucking show.

959
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,260
Fast.
Is that one of those that polian faster?

960
00:43:09,261 --> 00:43:11,000
You have to give it some time.
Um,

961
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:14,240
you know what man,
it got me like five minutes in.

962
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:18,110
I don't want to say how this episode
first episode right away you go,

963
00:43:18,111 --> 00:43:20,240
what?
Oh my God.

964
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,070
Oh Shit.
I mean,

965
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:24,500
they just,
they start off like a Quentin Tarantino

966
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:25,011
movie.
I mean,

967
00:43:25,011 --> 00:43:27,080
it's guns blazing.
I don't want to say,

968
00:43:27,081 --> 00:43:29,030
I don't want to say too much.
I'm gonna stop right there.

969
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:30,470
I'm gonna stop right there because it's
good.

970
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:32,030
Um,
stranger things,

971
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,210
stranger things is fucking awesome.
I love the son of a bitch.

972
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:38,930
I should love that.
That shows you got to go to a doctor.

973
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,630
It's too cheesy for me.
I don't know.

974
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,480
It's supposed to be cheesy.
I know,

975
00:43:44,481 --> 00:43:47,970
but it's like they're just copying
everything I love and making and making

976
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:50,500
it better and making it better.
Okay.

977
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:51,920
You know,
Jesus.

978
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:57,230
I love it.
It's great.

979
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,200
What do you like?
Uh,

980
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,220
like stupid shit.
Like fixer upper.

981
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,620
What's that?
It's where they buy these houses and

982
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,740
that in Waco,
Texas for like $50,000 and they spend

983
00:44:06,741 --> 00:44:10,430
$100,000 and they make it like this huge
mansion and it's cute.

984
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:12,540
I like fixer upper shows.
Those are,

985
00:44:12,541 --> 00:44:13,760
you don't like stuff like that?
No,

986
00:44:13,761 --> 00:44:14,750
I do.
I'd like those.

987
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,370
There's something satisfying about
those.

988
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,470
Yeah.
Like Adam Carolla show was good.

989
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:19,880
Satisfying.
Well,

990
00:44:19,881 --> 00:44:21,890
you would bus people but then they'd fix
it.

991
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,990
He'd bust people that are like shitty
carpenters.

992
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:27,350
They were really bad contractors are
doing terrible jobs on people's houses.

993
00:44:27,351 --> 00:44:29,300
That's a cool show too.
I always,

994
00:44:29,301 --> 00:44:32,010
when I was a kid I always watched it,
this old house with Vila and all that

995
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:32,630
shit.
It's like,

996
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:34,710
I prefer the positive shows though,
man.

997
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:37,410
I don't want to watch all these
contractors that are like ripping people

998
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:41,610
off and had a chef Gordon Ramsay.
Shit you don't like separate and I love

999
00:44:41,611 --> 00:44:42,810
that motherfucker.
I do.

1000
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,450
He gets very upset about food.
But I think that this,

1001
00:44:45,451 --> 00:44:48,390
um,
the what the style of show that I like

1002
00:44:48,391 --> 00:44:50,610
is when they take a house and then they
redo it.

1003
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,481
Right.
Those are the,

1004
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:52,900
those are my favorite ones.
Yeah.

1005
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:56,730
This show is really cool because it's a
husband and wife and she's just like a

1006
00:44:56,731 --> 00:44:58,490
bad ass designer.
Like she,

1007
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,580
she'll take it like just her paint style
and,

1008
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:03,690
and like how she makes this stuff is
very,

1009
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,480
very cool.
And so the these houses and makes you

1010
00:45:06,481 --> 00:45:09,330
depressed living at in La when you're
like I can't buy a house,

1011
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:12,160
$50,000 anywhere in Los Angeles at all.

1012
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:12,780
No.
Right.

1013
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:16,540
So it's,
it's amazing to see that exists.

1014
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:20,880
If you want to live in the pile spaces
expensive cause there's not as much of

1015
00:45:20,881 --> 00:45:22,500
it.
That's the craziest thing is New York

1016
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:24,180
City,
you know New York City,

1017
00:45:24,181 --> 00:45:28,620
they have apartments that are $20
million and it's an apartment.

1018
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,010
You're like,
wait a minute,

1019
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,290
it sounded apartment,
apartment.

1020
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:32,250
No,
it's an apartment.

1021
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,800
Even apartment.
You have a great view.

1022
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,730
It's a great view but it's a fucking
apartment and it cost $20 million.

1023
00:45:38,731 --> 00:45:39,451
You're like,
wait a minute.

1024
00:45:39,451 --> 00:45:40,710
How many people are in the building with
me?

1025
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:43,110
Thousands.
No,

1026
00:45:43,111 --> 00:45:44,100
really?
Yes.

1027
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:47,040
You're on the top floor.
There's thousands of people and you're

1028
00:45:47,041 --> 00:45:50,880
all in a giant metal and concrete box.
That'd be 20 million police.

1029
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:54,600
Like why in the fuck are you talking
about who wants to live like that?

1030
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:58,750
If you ever like a pet,
is it like 1.2 million a month or a pet

1031
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,300
you nail?

1032
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,900
You have to pay extra because you
haven't done much.

1033
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,430
I think you might have exaggerated.
No.

1034
00:46:03,431 --> 00:46:05,400
I think if you're buying it,
you own it,

1035
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,950
but if you're renting it,
I bet there's a lot of places that won't

1036
00:46:07,951 --> 00:46:11,220
want to rent if you have a dog because
the dog wants a fucking things up,

1037
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,540
you know,
dogs will we bite things and shit on

1038
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:19,380
places and Piss on things.
We're not supposed to dealing with that

1039
00:46:19,381 --> 00:46:21,720
now it can happen.
Yeah,

1040
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:26,070
but I just,
it's hard to imagine that that's the

1041
00:46:26,071 --> 00:46:29,130
right way to live.
I bet it's exciting as fuck.

1042
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,350
I bet.
Living in a giant apartment in New York

1043
00:46:31,351 --> 00:46:34,620
City and deep and everywhere you go,
there's just overwhelmed by giant

1044
00:46:34,621 --> 00:46:37,500
numbers of people.
It must be exciting as fuck.

1045
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,020
It's really interesting.
It's like you're in the middle of the

1046
00:46:40,021 --> 00:46:45,021
high line,
but I just don't think that leaves you a

1047
00:46:46,351 --> 00:46:48,990
lot of time for quiet and reflection.

1048
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:51,840
I mean,
you can force yourself into a room and

1049
00:46:51,841 --> 00:46:54,930
shut the door,
but I think this is just a theory,

1050
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:58,200
but I really think we need a certain
amount of actual space between each

1051
00:46:58,201 --> 00:46:59,310
other.
To relax.

1052
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:00,930
Absolutely.
This is just my feeling.

1053
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,990
I feel like if I go over someone's
house,

1054
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:05,070
they live in the country and I go sit
out on their porch.

1055
00:47:05,071 --> 00:47:07,240
It's like,
why don't I live like us?

1056
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:09,810
How can we all live like this?
So this is how you're supposed to live.

1057
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,970
Like this feels great.
Like you go,

1058
00:47:11,971 --> 00:47:14,370
you look,
you see fucking rolling hills.

1059
00:47:14,371 --> 00:47:17,010
You see birds and shit.
Like this feels great.

1060
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:21,120
Like you see the trees see water
dripping off of him and the sunlight's

1061
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,220
peeking through the leaves and you go,
God,

1062
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:25,260
this feels so good.
Like,

1063
00:47:25,261 --> 00:47:29,740
why don't I see this all the time
instead of fuck you.

1064
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:30,280
Fuck

1065
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,320
you,
go back to you fucking country queer.

1066
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:34,833
You know,

1067
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,180
uh,
the

1068
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:42,640
fucking smoke and farts and cigarettes
and people smell like truecar.

1069
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,650
Ah,
ah.

1070
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,730
What have we done?
Pissing in the streets?

1071
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,520
Garbage bags piled up,
ripped at the bottom.

1072
00:47:49,521 --> 00:47:51,800
Nobody cares.
Guy Picks it up.

1073
00:47:51,801 --> 00:47:56,801
Some of it falls out.
They drive on fuck Bram Bram or

1074
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:05,190
just sitting,
chilling.

1075
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:09,940
Just sit in on some soft grass.
You back against the tree just sitting

1076
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:12,440
there.
It feels better than on some stupid ass

1077
00:48:12,441 --> 00:48:15,560
fucking park bench watching some wine.
No heat zone shit.

1078
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,353
Right.

1079
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,350
I did not understand how people do it.
Like

1080
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,990
he loves it.
He loves it.

1081
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,170
Oh,
you talked to Ariba,

1082
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,133
New York City.
I love it.

1083
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,540
It's the best.
It's the most to grover.

1084
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,020
I'm living there for toy dog.
Yeah,

1085
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,740
definitely.
Fuck the winter though.

1086
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:34,600
Who Kick?
He's the best.

1087
00:48:34,601 --> 00:48:35,870
He bails every winter.
Fuck.

1088
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,810
Que New York.
I'll see you dummies later.

1089
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:43,340
He comes La.
He lives here for three months.

1090
00:48:43,341 --> 00:48:44,690
Then it goes back.
It's awesome.

1091
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:47,440
It's fucking funny shit man.

1092
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,840
That's the way to do it.
It's a funny way to do it.

1093
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:51,360
I mean,
I think he's going to do somewhere to

1094
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:52,300
time,
but that went to Tom.

1095
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:54,010
Did Dunkin in salaries you back?
Yes,

1096
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:55,810
he's back.
He's back.

1097
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,060
We had him for a little while and we
lost him.

1098
00:48:58,061 --> 00:48:59,440
Now he's back.
He's coming in.

1099
00:48:59,441 --> 00:49:01,200
We're doing a shrimp parade.
Uh,

1100
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,620
Christopher Ryan,
him and me.

1101
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,140
Yeah.
I knew Duncan would be back,

1102
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:09,230
you know.
But uh,

1103
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:11,130
just like that winter is a different
thing,

1104
00:49:11,131 --> 00:49:11,940
man.
You,

1105
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,640
you're either used to it or you're not,
and if you're not,

1106
00:49:14,641 --> 00:49:17,630
you better change.
You gotta change your expectations for,

1107
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:20,250
for your,
the way you interface with the world.

1108
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:22,920
Because if you're not wearing a certain
amount of clothing,

1109
00:49:22,921 --> 00:49:25,020
you're going to fucking die.
Okay?

1110
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:26,730
Get your kids bundling mob.
No,

1111
00:49:26,731 --> 00:49:28,050
you can't wear sneakers.
No,

1112
00:49:28,051 --> 00:49:29,670
you have to wear socks.
Okay.

1113
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:35,710
Fucking zero out.
Zero and the streets are all covered

1114
00:49:35,721 --> 00:49:39,530
with black guys,
so we can't walk very fast and cars are

1115
00:49:39,531 --> 00:49:42,650
going to be sliding the area.
They can't stop.

1116
00:49:42,651 --> 00:49:43,680
Bang.
You get

1117
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:47,200
drown like bowling balls.
That's real shit.

1118
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:51,100
That's real winter stuff like you,
you tried shoveling your way out of your

1119
00:49:51,101 --> 00:49:52,720
apartment building and you're like,
wait a minute.

1120
00:49:52,721 --> 00:49:54,160
What?
What?

1121
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,610
What the fuck?
You can't drive anywhere.

1122
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:00,640
Stones stacked up on the sides.
There's nowhere to put it.

1123
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:03,850
Like you better be ready for this.
You're feet are cold.

1124
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:04,803
Oh,
okay.

1125
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:06,980
Want to go back?
Who's cool book?

1126
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,320
Good move.
Never again.

1127
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:12,520
I'll tell you what,
dude.

1128
00:50:12,521 --> 00:50:16,120
I liked it.
I liked it when I go into snow now too.

1129
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,670
Like one of the things I like,
I don't even really like skiing that

1130
00:50:18,671 --> 00:50:20,020
much,
but I like being in the snow.

1131
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:22,090
So what I like,
I like,

1132
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,430
I like,
I like this feeling like,

1133
00:50:24,431 --> 00:50:27,350
hey,
we barely got this one under control by

1134
00:50:27,351 --> 00:50:28,820
early.
Like you can go out,

1135
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,760
but you gotta be wearing down and shit
all bundled up.

1136
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,220
You got to have things over your little
fucking bully,

1137
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,320
bullshit,
fleshy digits,

1138
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,660
these little soft bitch ass hands of
yours,

1139
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,430
his,
those things break off.

1140
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:42,830
They freeze,
they freeze and they turned black and

1141
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:45,500
snap off your feet.
If you,

1142
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:47,720
if you keep your feet too cold,
your feet,

1143
00:50:47,721 --> 00:50:50,510
you lose your feet.
They hack your toes off and shit.

1144
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,730
He gets frostbite.
That's real.

1145
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:55,370
People lose toes cause ears.
Oh yeah.

1146
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:57,770
Fuck yeah.
Frostbites no joke man.

1147
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,980
Frostbite kills your skin.
Like that's a wrap.

1148
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:02,240
It's over.
You're like,

1149
00:51:02,241 --> 00:51:03,350
you want gang green?
No,

1150
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,540
we gotta chop this piece off.
This piece is done.

1151
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,930
That happens to people.
That doesn't happen out here

1152
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,280
except for in a cryo chamber or whatever
and that's only one girl never,

1153
00:51:13,281 --> 00:51:16,190
and she fell asleep.
That was a very unfortunate story.

1154
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:18,000
She was apparently working there and she
did

1155
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,210
to herself.
She looked,

1156
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:22,340
she set the machine up for herself alone
and uh,

1157
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,480
she was too short and the nitrogen got
into her lungs.

1158
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:28,150
She's like breathing it in.
She wasn't breathing in air and she

1159
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:30,010
blacked out.
Horrible,

1160
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:31,660
horrible,
horrible story.

1161
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,270
Ooh,
just hearing it makes your fucking whole

1162
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,440
body clench up.
Like,

1163
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,760
Ooh,
what a way to die.

1164
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:41,290
That's so crazy.
Frozen to death at a cryo chamber.

1165
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:44,680
Have you seen this map going around?
That is,

1166
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:47,120
there's this little county right here is
Los Angeles.

1167
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,760
Oh,
there's more people in this county then

1168
00:51:49,761 --> 00:51:52,790
these other 41 states together.
Not combined,

1169
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:55,520
but each of them,
none of them are,

1170
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,740
have,
are more populous than this little tiny

1171
00:51:57,741 --> 00:51:58,970
guy.
That's craziness.

1172
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:03,440
I think that's only with the 10 million,
uh,

1173
00:52:03,441 --> 00:52:05,140
official population counts.
Yeah.

1174
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:06,890
We're a mad Hubba people sun.
Yeah.

1175
00:52:06,891 --> 00:52:09,830
It's so crazy.
The 526 square miles,

1176
00:52:09,831 --> 00:52:11,630
which isn't even that big.
I feel like,

1177
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,730
I mean it looks big,
but we keep talking.

1178
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:15,230
Where are we going?
Where are we going?

1179
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:18,420
Where do we go?
What if we're going to bust a move.

1180
00:52:18,421 --> 00:52:20,190
Oh,
do I say Seattle still need good

1181
00:52:20,191 --> 00:52:21,100
internet?
Yeah.

1182
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:23,850
So now it might be the spot.
You know why?

1183
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,650
Cause you get like a little bit of
weather.

1184
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,513
You Go,
hey bitch,

1185
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,960
listen.
You better appreciate June.

1186
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:30,360
Okay.
You better appreciate July because

1187
00:52:30,361 --> 00:52:32,670
November is going to roll around just
like it did last year and everyone's

1188
00:52:32,671 --> 00:52:34,050
going to be depressed.
Okay.

1189
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,850
Okay.
I appreciate it.

1190
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:39,300
So if you go out in Seattle in like
August people,

1191
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,550
what about Oregon?
Cause it's in between the,

1192
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,990
the mother hubs of Google and Amazon are
bad spot right between them.

1193
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:50,080
I think the move is Eugene.
We move in next to Dan Carlin and

1194
00:52:50,081 --> 00:52:51,930
Cameron Hanes.
Climb that mountain,

1195
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:53,790
climb that mountain,
all Santa Barbara,

1196
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,240
my bus spot and my butt's and that's a
good guy.

1197
00:52:57,330 --> 00:53:01,680
That's a good God damn spot.
It's like la light and has good wine and

1198
00:53:01,681 --> 00:53:03,420
places to go.
Yeah.

1199
00:53:03,421 --> 00:53:05,100
Nice people.
Yeah.

1200
00:53:05,101 --> 00:53:07,350
I like Santa Barbara to chill beach to
you.

1201
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:09,030
Go to that beach people.
Super friendly.

1202
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:11,670
Cute Zoo.
Oh damn man,

1203
00:53:11,671 --> 00:53:14,610
that's a good spot.
Santa Barbara might be the perfect spot.

1204
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:17,160
It's a good spot.
Shit,

1205
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:20,250
I shouldn't have told everybody you're
going to run out there

1206
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:24,330
and Barbara Bro.
And they promise Seattle is the,

1207
00:53:24,331 --> 00:53:27,450
you know like when you,
we're from Ohio where it's gray sky

1208
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,060
every day and Seattle,
I think it's going to be kind of like

1209
00:53:30,061 --> 00:53:33,330
that.
I think there's way too many gray skies.

1210
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:34,223
Here's the thing though,

1211
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:37,670
are you willing to trade some grace guys
for cooler people?

1212
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:40,630
The thing about it,
and I'm not saying everybody in Seattle

1213
00:53:40,631 --> 00:53:43,070
is cooler than everybody in La.
I love people in La.

1214
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:46,250
I'm not saying that,
but you're getting a kind of,

1215
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:48,830
this is just my opinion,
and this might not be right,

1216
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:54,020
but I have a feeling that you have,
you develop more character in an

1217
00:53:54,021 --> 00:53:57,230
environment where your comfort is
tested.

1218
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:02,030
I think if you live in a cold
environment where it's cold in the

1219
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:02,691
winter,
if you live in,

1220
00:54:02,691 --> 00:54:05,280
where would it really rains and you get
soaked and you,

1221
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:10,100
you hear the thunder outside.
The [inaudible] is a humbling to that

1222
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:15,290
experience that people that live in la
just don't fucking get.

1223
00:54:15,291 --> 00:54:18,560
And it's one of the reasons why people
in a lot of these other states get

1224
00:54:18,561 --> 00:54:21,650
annoyed at some of the attitudes that
people in La have.

1225
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:25,820
It's because you were not experiencing
anything other than traffic.

1226
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:29,780
Like these people get snowed on every
year.

1227
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,940
Every year they're digging themselves
out.

1228
00:54:31,941 --> 00:54:32,661
We're like,
yeah,

1229
00:54:32,661 --> 00:54:33,740
well what the fuck,
man?

1230
00:54:33,741 --> 00:54:36,350
I'm stuck in traffic,
man.

1231
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,880
Like she don't have any constantly.
It's one day it got too hot and you had

1232
00:54:40,881 --> 00:54:42,650
to turn the fan on.
Ooh,

1233
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,020
you're going to be okay.
You're going to be okay.

1234
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:49,280
Just drink water and go buy ice at the
store like you're going to live.

1235
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:51,410
Even if it sucks,
you're gonna sweat a lot.

1236
00:54:51,411 --> 00:54:52,670
Drink a lot of water.
You're going to live.

1237
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,770
It's 110 stay inside.
Stay in the shade.

1238
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:56,630
You're going to live.
It's going to suck,

1239
00:54:56,631 --> 00:55:00,200
but you're going to live.
You might not live if you're living in

1240
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:04,310
Chicago and you can't,
and your old lady and your power goes

1241
00:55:04,311 --> 00:55:06,020
out and you're stuck in your house.

1242
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:07,420
What's that?
Traffic,

1243
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:09,330
but that traffic.
Do you see the traffic last night of

1244
00:55:09,331 --> 00:55:11,160
everyone coming home?
It was just as bad.

1245
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,230
Look at that.
That's insane.

1246
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:13,730
Yeah.

1247
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:16,670
It's a video and it says Thanksgiving
traffic,

1248
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:19,640
Los Angeles,
four or five freeway at a complete

1249
00:55:19,641 --> 00:55:24,641
standstill and it is fucking miles.
I mean miles and miles and miles of

1250
00:55:26,601 --> 00:55:29,600
people that look at the going five miles
an hour in either direction

1251
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:34,140
and when Satan is red because of the
rear lights and the other one's white

1252
00:55:34,141 --> 00:55:35,850
because of the headline.
That's crazy.

1253
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:37,350
Videos.
Crazy.

1254
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,380
Fuck this place.
We got to go.

1255
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,650
Where do I go?
I was just telling me when I'm weird.

1256
00:55:43,651 --> 00:55:44,970
We go,
here's the thing,

1257
00:55:44,971 --> 00:55:47,940
where do we go?
I'm up for Seattle or Santa Barbara.

1258
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,700
Maybe we should go to Arizona.
No,

1259
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,830
I would go right next to where the walls
being built.

1260
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,450
That'd be a party.
I know it doesn't,

1261
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:56,710
it's still like we saw the sunny days in
Denver.

1262
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:00,040
[inaudible] get cold.
They're like zero or is it just,

1263
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:00,990
yeah,
yeah,

1264
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:01,651
yeah,
definitely.

1265
00:56:01,651 --> 00:56:04,230
Can I think about Denver's,
it's Super Fun.

1266
00:56:04,231 --> 00:56:04,980
Flexible.

1267
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:07,980
Denver will go to zero.
You get nine degrees for a few days and

1268
00:56:07,981 --> 00:56:12,090
then there'll be 60 it's weird.
It's weird because you're like way up

1269
00:56:12,091 --> 00:56:12,781
high.
You know,

1270
00:56:12,781 --> 00:56:14,430
you're,
you're literally at a mile high.

1271
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:17,520
I think Denver is 5,000 feet above sea
level.

1272
00:56:17,521 --> 00:56:19,920
5,500 it's exactly a mile.
Yeah.

1273
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:20,803
So that's,
it's a,

1274
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:24,340
it's a very high city when,
when you're talking about a lot of other

1275
00:56:24,341 --> 00:56:29,341
words too.
It's a very interesting place man.

1276
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,040
It's a,
it's a different spot cause like Denver,

1277
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:40,960
either they're in this weird like
combination world,

1278
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:42,550
right?
This is the way I put Denver.

1279
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:45,130
Like you have a city that's like a real
city.

1280
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:47,860
You have the comedy works.
It's one of the best comedy clubs in the

1281
00:56:47,861 --> 00:56:49,210
world.
They have to,

1282
00:56:49,211 --> 00:56:52,030
comedy works there.
I think they have an Improv there too.

1283
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:54,010
Don't they have a Denver Improv?
I don't know.

1284
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,630
I've never heard of I improv everywhere.

1285
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:57,730
Those fuckers,
they're out there.

1286
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,940
They're constantly bringing,
bringing the funny to the people.

1287
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:02,670
Yeah.
They,

1288
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:04,360
they're everywhere.
The end probes are everywhere.

1289
00:57:04,361 --> 00:57:07,780
Right?
But Denver has like everything that it

1290
00:57:07,781 --> 00:57:11,980
has restaurants,
it has like a real urban life.

1291
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:14,230
It's a real cities,
real buildings and shit.

1292
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,430
And then on top of that,
you're right next to the God damn rocket

1293
00:57:17,431 --> 00:57:19,690
mountains.
Like you look out the window,

1294
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:23,980
like we were just there the other day.
Me and Tony did a Gig at the Belko and

1295
00:57:23,981 --> 00:57:24,850
we were driving home.
I was like,

1296
00:57:24,851 --> 00:57:25,684
Dude,
look at that.

1297
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:27,910
That's right there.
That's the rocky mountains.

1298
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:31,210
It's right there.
Like these fucking people are staring at

1299
00:57:31,211 --> 00:57:33,310
the continental divide.
I mean,

1300
00:57:33,311 --> 00:57:36,670
they're just looking at the rocky
mountains.

1301
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:39,640
You could just go,
you could drive up to the top of the

1302
00:57:39,641 --> 00:57:43,840
hills like uh,
up near Nederland and shit like that and

1303
00:57:43,841 --> 00:57:45,850
see these like quaint towns.

1304
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:48,370
It's still exists on dirt roads into the
woods.

1305
00:57:48,371 --> 00:57:49,790
You're like,
Whoa,

1306
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:52,230
Whoa,
oh,

1307
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,720
I'd probably did Denver.
That would be the only place that had

1308
00:57:55,721 --> 00:57:57,760
snow I would move to.
That's the spot.

1309
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:01,150
I think Denver's a spot.
It's just seattle.

1310
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,700
My go.
My go with a good quake.

1311
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:06,450
Yeah.
Good and quick volcano mount.

1312
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:07,540
Yeah.
Yeah.

1313
00:58:07,541 --> 00:58:12,541
The volcano could blow and if Mount
Saint Helens volcano could blow tsunami.

1314
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:18,100
There was some tsunami shit about
Seattle that was in the newspaper for

1315
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:21,790
years ago that was actually causing a
drop in real estate in Seattle.

1316
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:23,830
Cause people were like,
wait,

1317
00:58:23,831 --> 00:58:27,790
what?
Like they were talking about how someday

1318
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:31,630
the next hundred years a giant
earthquake and tsunami is going to level

1319
00:58:31,631 --> 00:58:33,910
Seattle.
And what,

1320
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:37,480
you can't just say that I'm trying to
sell my house,

1321
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:41,500
the disaster waiting to happen at the
northwest.

1322
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,930
Huh.
See if you can find the article.

1323
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:47,540
Like the article was something about con
dammit.

1324
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,840
If I can remember,
uh,

1325
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,760
earthquake,
earthquake in soon.

1326
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:54,710
What does it look?
Natural disaster danger zone.

1327
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:59,620
I don't think so.
Experts,

1328
00:58:59,621 --> 00:59:01,390
they've uh,
on the really big one,

1329
00:59:01,391 --> 00:59:04,900
here's what will actually happen.
That might be it anyway,

1330
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:09,130
point being scared the fuck out of
everybody because it was one of those

1331
00:59:09,131 --> 00:59:13,120
stories that was kind of like one person
reported on it and then it went around,

1332
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:15,760
you know,
you know those like you get them on dig

1333
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:17,860
or something like that and you and then
you go to twitter,

1334
00:59:17,861 --> 00:59:19,810
someone will have,
it will be linked to another website.

1335
00:59:19,811 --> 00:59:20,920
You can go and check and be like,
Whoa,

1336
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:21,470
Whoa,
Whoa,

1337
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:22,650
whoa.
Is this really happening?

1338
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,920
Seattle go on under what the fuck?
I'm like,

1339
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:27,560
out of nowhere.
But uh,

1340
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:28,940
in my,
we might lose Seattle.

1341
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,340
So let's,
let's think,

1342
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:33,440
get off the list.
How much are you scared of bears,

1343
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:36,320
right?

1344
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,810
Toronto.
See if you're not scared of bears,

1345
00:59:38,811 --> 00:59:41,960
the move is Montana.
Montana is the move.

1346
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:43,640
You know why?
Cause Montana's like Denver.

1347
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,340
Well with less people,
like you got an airport.

1348
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:49,130
If you're willing to give up a day,
you've got an airport you can get out.

1349
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:51,440
Okay.
You got to give up an extra day though

1350
00:59:51,441 --> 00:59:53,330
for travel.
Cause you've got to get out and fly

1351
00:59:53,331 --> 00:59:55,550
somewhere and then from there you fly
out.

1352
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:58,220
And so like the odds are you doing a
show that night?

1353
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:00,830
You can really probably couldn't do it.
You'd probably have to leave Thursday

1354
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:03,650
for a Friday night show.
What did you get back the same day?

1355
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,480
Same weather.
Yeah,

1356
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:09,140
but bears like the big kind of now I
kind of knew people,

1357
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,710
grizzly bears for cool people.
What do you do?

1358
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:16,010
He started fly fishing camp.
Why are you laughing?

1359
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:21,610
Why is that the first
cars fly fishing the awesome and you

1360
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:22,280
could do it there.

1361
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:23,000
It's a great place.
I mean,

1362
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,580
look,
I'm in at night like after you set up

1363
01:00:25,581 --> 01:00:28,880
and you put a gun right by your bed in
case the wolves come cause they're

1364
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:30,650
wolves to just,
whoa.

1365
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,880
Did you see the rocks in the movie that
has the 34?

1366
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:34,760
Yes.
That's perfect movie for him.

1367
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:40,190
I'm very excited to see it.
Did you see his new Tattoo Nikko

1368
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:42,680
Hurtado?
I made this fucking dope like bull

1369
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:45,590
skull.
He used to have that bull on his arm and

1370
01:00:45,591 --> 01:00:49,940
he updated it with this like insane bull
skull that uh,

1371
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:54,390
um,
Nikki Hurtado made here.

1372
01:00:54,391 --> 01:00:57,110
It make that larger so we could see.
Wow,

1373
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:59,210
look at that.
Sweet.

1374
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:02,240
That is insane.
Tattoo man.

1375
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,530
I mean,
and the other,

1376
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:07,280
the old tattoos still in it.
See it how the old tattoo is like the

1377
01:01:07,281 --> 01:01:09,590
cracks now.
That's so cool.

1378
01:01:09,591 --> 01:01:12,080
Yeah.
He made the old tattoo like a part of

1379
01:01:12,081 --> 01:01:12,980
the new tattoo.

1380
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:17,180
I mean it is fucking dope and it doesn't
like you have to look at it to know the

1381
01:01:17,181 --> 01:01:21,920
old tattoo is in there cause he's turned
it into these cracks in the bones of

1382
01:01:21,921 --> 01:01:23,810
these,
the bison skull.

1383
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,040
Fuck man.
It's awesome.

1384
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:26,090
Or The bull,
Scott,

1385
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:29,170
whatever it is.
That guy's a bad motherfucker.

1386
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,660
You were seen his dad tunes.
Yeah.

1387
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,930
Pull up some of his dad to is go to his
instagram page.

1388
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:36,620
His fucking tattoo work is amazing.
Amazing.

1389
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:41,310
He does all kinds of weird shit and a
lot of photographic stuff where you

1390
01:01:41,311 --> 01:01:43,910
don't,
he'll have like a photograph of,

1391
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:46,310
you know Elvira's I'm shit.
And it'll just like,

1392
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:48,170
perfect.
I don't know why I said Elvira,

1393
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,890
go to Nikko.
Hurtado has a page.

1394
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:53,630
Oh,
but go to his page.

1395
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:54,950
As I said,
I said,

1396
01:01:54,951 --> 01:01:56,330
Nikki,
it's Nico.

1397
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:57,530
Sorry.
Sorry.

1398
01:01:57,531 --> 01:01:59,060
Nico.
Are you done with tattoos?

1399
01:01:59,090 --> 01:01:59,840
You're going?
Nope.

1400
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,090
Nope.
We're back.

1401
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,200
Yeah.
I'm going to do a tramp stamp.

1402
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,270
I'm gonna have her on my back.
The game of thrones.

1403
01:02:05,271 --> 01:02:07,550
Lady,
Queen of Dragons,

1404
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,260
mother of dragons.
Oh my God.

1405
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,780
How dope is his artwork though?
It's,

1406
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:13,220
wait,
look at that.

1407
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:15,590
It's dude his,
his artworks and saying,

1408
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:16,770
where's he from?
What?

1409
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:19,070
He's a California guy.
Look at the lips on that thing.

1410
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:20,430
Oh my gosh.
It's crazy.

1411
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:23,040
It's just crazy.
What does that woman's supposed to be?

1412
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:25,350
She had a demon or something.
He's got a skull.

1413
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:28,980
Wow.
It's amazing when you zoom in on it and

1414
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:30,570
see how,
how good the details are,

1415
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:33,060
these incredible style.
But um,

1416
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:34,620
yeah,
I mean there's so many really good

1417
01:02:34,621 --> 01:02:35,820
tattoo artists now.
I mean,

1418
01:02:35,821 --> 01:02:37,950
this is a weird time for the art form
because it's,

1419
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,800
for whatever reason,
I guess probably a lot of those tattoo

1420
01:02:40,801 --> 01:02:42,980
shows in specific,
they,

1421
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:46,830
they made,
it seems like more people understand it

1422
01:02:46,831 --> 01:02:48,480
more as an art form,
you know,

1423
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:53,600
like give more like legit worldclass
artists worldclass word way to put it.

1424
01:02:53,761 --> 01:02:55,680
But legit,
talented,

1425
01:02:55,681 --> 01:02:58,230
super talented artists that decided to
become tattoo artists,

1426
01:02:58,680 --> 01:02:59,513
you know.

1427
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,810
See this thing.
What is it,

1428
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:04,750
temporary tattoo printer on your arm
machine?

1429
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:06,241
I mean,
not,

1430
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:07,930
not to think that,
I don't know if that lasts as long as

1431
01:03:07,931 --> 01:03:09,970
like a temporary tattoo,
which isn't very long at all.

1432
01:03:09,971 --> 01:03:11,680
But,
um,

1433
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:14,770
at full color and probably just works
off a jpeg or something.

1434
01:03:14,771 --> 01:03:17,080
So you could try out then.
How long does it last for?

1435
01:03:17,081 --> 01:03:18,910
I don't know.
I was guessing as long as the temporary

1436
01:03:18,911 --> 01:03:20,560
tattoo,
but I feel like it's a little bit

1437
01:03:20,561 --> 01:03:22,310
longer.
It's like a stamp that says,

1438
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:23,180
they might say,
okay,

1439
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,273
better

1440
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:28,790
what?
Design your own tattoo on the APP.

1441
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:30,110
Oh Man.
We're getting little kids

1442
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:32,880
this indoctrination.
They're trying to get these kids to

1443
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:36,060
accept the numbers when they come and
collect the all for camps.

1444
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:38,340
God,
what was he saying the other day about

1445
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:41,880
robots?
It was that what it was you like said

1446
01:03:41,881 --> 01:03:45,650
something like you tweeted him back like
something like lol.

1447
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:47,260
What?
Glitchy.

1448
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:49,380
Yeah.
What was that?

1449
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,350
I love that guy.
But sometimes you say shit that I just

1450
01:03:52,351 --> 01:03:53,184
go,
what?

1451
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:56,310
He needs someone like me next to you all
the time.

1452
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:59,460
That's what Alex Jones needs.
He just needs me to go,

1453
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:00,271
hey man,
what?

1454
01:04:00,271 --> 01:04:01,200
Stop.
Stop,

1455
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:02,040
stop,
stop.

1456
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,860
That might not be it.
Some people need a rudder.

1457
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:06,470
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

1458
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:08,100
And by the way,
if I'm your rudder,

1459
01:04:08,101 --> 01:04:11,820
you've got a serious fucking problem.
You got a serious fucking problem.

1460
01:04:11,821 --> 01:04:14,830
I was hoping that flat earth or what's
going to like the rock.

1461
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,530
I was waiting,
I was so excited for this.

1462
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:22,050
He's done it before.
He shot himself like 160 miles into

1463
01:04:22,051 --> 01:04:24,240
space or some shit.
Not really.

1464
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:26,311
No,
he did.

1465
01:04:26,311 --> 01:04:29,880
I think he did shoot himself like 1.6
miles into the air.

1466
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:33,000
Something ridiculous in the past and he
recovered.

1467
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:36,990
Took him like several days to recover
from the g forces.

1468
01:04:36,991 --> 01:04:39,570
I do believe that this is something that
was in the article.

1469
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,640
It might be something he said.
He might just be crazy.

1470
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:43,830
Yeah.
He's trying to be like evil knievel.

1471
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,710
He was trying to do a bunch of different
things and he jumped onto the flat earth

1472
01:04:46,711 --> 01:04:48,520
thing about a year ago to gain money.
So,

1473
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:49,523
oh,

1474
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,830
he's trying to like jump a limo over a
boards,

1475
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:53,810
some dumb shit like that.

1476
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,120
Well no one believes it.
Come in.

1477
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:55,891
How do you know?
Oh,

1478
01:04:55,891 --> 01:04:57,840
do yes they do.
I'm a bitch.

1479
01:04:58,010 --> 01:05:00,410
I read the article about it when it
first was coming out last week.

1480
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:01,210
Yeah.
You know what,

1481
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:03,230
I've,
I've read one of the craziest fucking

1482
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:06,320
arguments.
Someone said one of the flat earth

1483
01:05:06,321 --> 01:05:08,780
proponents said about it,
it's,

1484
01:05:08,781 --> 01:05:10,820
this is going around apparently,
so forgive me,

1485
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:15,880
forgive me if you've heard this,
but the idea that a ship doesn't really

1486
01:05:16,341 --> 01:05:20,800
disappear over the horizon do,
you can always zoom in on it if you just

1487
01:05:20,801 --> 01:05:24,160
have enough of a,
of a powerful lens on your camera.

1488
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:28,660
So they think that that in some way is
proof that the earth is flat.

1489
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:32,740
That's just proof of how far you can
see.

1490
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:34,870
It's all it is.
He likes,

1491
01:05:34,871 --> 01:05:38,650
you don't understand like the,
the curve of the earth.

1492
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:41,710
It takes forever.
It's fucking huge.

1493
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,470
Like you're,
I get what people are doing.

1494
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,690
Like who come if you zoom out,
you can see,

1495
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:50,110
well you can't forever.
That's why he can't see Mt.

1496
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:51,820
Kilimanjaro from your fucking living
room in Santa Monica.

1497
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:53,700
Dip Shit.
All right.

1498
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:57,370
Like it's a curve to it.
It just takes a long ass time and you

1499
01:05:57,371 --> 01:06:01,480
can't see the boat long before it goes
over the curb because unless you're

1500
01:06:01,481 --> 01:06:05,830
talking about a giant ass boat and even
a giant ass boat at 30 miles away,

1501
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:09,760
which is what you still be able to see,
some of it that's too far for your eyes.

1502
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:13,840
So if you zoom in with some sort of a
crazy spotting scope or something like

1503
01:06:13,841 --> 01:06:14,411
that,
yeah,

1504
01:06:14,411 --> 01:06:17,740
you'll be able to see it for a little
while and then in another couple of

1505
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:19,860
hours it would be gone.
It's going to go over the topic,

1506
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:25,160
but they want it to be real so bad.
They want it to be real so bad that they

1507
01:06:26,201 --> 01:06:29,710
come up with these things that aren't
true as examples.

1508
01:06:29,711 --> 01:06:33,370
Why the earth is flat and the big one
was know there's how come every photo of

1509
01:06:33,371 --> 01:06:35,050
the earth from space is a composite.

1510
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:38,860
You didn't even bother to look into it
because that's not true.

1511
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:43,630
If there's a fucking satellite that
takes a high resolution photo of the

1512
01:06:43,631 --> 01:06:45,700
earth,
something like every 10 minutes,

1513
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:48,160
so the him Awori eight to Japanese
style.

1514
01:06:48,161 --> 01:06:50,740
You could go online,
you could look at the pictures.

1515
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:55,720
It shows where every fucking storm cloud
is all over the country in real time.

1516
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,570
So if there's a storm that's hitting
Cuba,

1517
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,450
you go to that.
You look at that image from that day

1518
01:07:01,451 --> 01:07:03,280
where the storm's,
you'll see the fucking storm,

1519
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:07,180
like it's all real.
If you don't believe that's real.

1520
01:07:07,181 --> 01:07:11,800
Do you believe that someone is so good
at hiding shit that they've kept all the

1521
01:07:11,801 --> 01:07:14,770
images of the flat earth from ever being
published,

1522
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:17,800
that no one has been able to treat in
the history of people,

1523
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:21,640
it's been able to travel,
pass the ice wall and to the Nether

1524
01:07:21,641 --> 01:07:24,520
region of hobbits and gnomes and pixies
elves.

1525
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:27,730
It's just mental health.
You know,

1526
01:07:27,731 --> 01:07:30,520
we have a huge problem.
Lack of education,

1527
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:34,510
lack of education,
and then it's also being committed to

1528
01:07:34,511 --> 01:07:36,730
these ideas to the point where they're a
part of you.

1529
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:40,330
It's Aye.
It's idea identity,

1530
01:07:40,331 --> 01:07:42,190
politics.
This is what it is.

1531
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:45,640
When you,
when you believe in an idea so much that

1532
01:07:45,641 --> 01:07:48,010
you don't,
and I've been guilty of this and I think

1533
01:07:48,011 --> 01:07:51,850
everybody has at one point in your life
you've been guilty of not really looking

1534
01:07:51,851 --> 01:07:54,610
at it for what it is,
but instead looking at it for what you

1535
01:07:54,611 --> 01:07:58,320
want it to be and for what you've
already committed yourself to believing

1536
01:07:58,321 --> 01:08:00,280
in.
That's a big part of the problem.

1537
01:08:00,281 --> 01:08:03,700
A big part of the problem with people is
you commit yourself to believing in

1538
01:08:03,701 --> 01:08:05,950
something and then when you commit
yourself to believe me,

1539
01:08:05,951 --> 01:08:08,650
it's something.
Anything that's contrary to that belief

1540
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:11,800
gets fought viciously.
You shut it down,

1541
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,990
you into robbed.
By all means necessary.

1542
01:08:13,991 --> 01:08:15,740
You mock it,
you deride it.

1543
01:08:15,741 --> 01:08:19,180
You don't examine it objectively.
He don't look at it objectively.

1544
01:08:19,190 --> 01:08:20,690
You just look for a way to shoot it
down,

1545
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,820
look for a way to shit on it.
Look for way,

1546
01:08:22,821 --> 01:08:25,850
if in any fallback on the government
lies all the time.

1547
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:28,160
I never believed that fall back on all
these different positions,

1548
01:08:28,161 --> 01:08:29,270
but at the end of the day,

1549
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,020
okay,

1550
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:34,080
if you look at it from just like,
well,

1551
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:36,090
okay,
what's the most likely thing?

1552
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,820
The most likely thing is it's round.
They figured it out.

1553
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:40,740
They know it's round.
You can see it from space.

1554
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:43,380
They've taken pictures of it.
People have absolutely flying in the

1555
01:08:43,381 --> 01:08:46,470
space station.
There's videos of the fucking the thing

1556
01:08:46,471 --> 01:08:50,370
landing on the sky.
People pulling people out of the water.

1557
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:52,440
They they've seen,
they've gone into space.

1558
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:53,700
Okay.
They've taken pictures.

1559
01:08:53,701 --> 01:08:55,350
This is all real.
There's satellites.

1560
01:08:55,351 --> 01:08:57,720
They're real.
If you get satellite radio,

1561
01:08:57,750 --> 01:08:59,340
it's real.
Okay.

1562
01:08:59,341 --> 01:09:01,800
It's really from a satellite.
When you get direct tv,

1563
01:09:01,801 --> 01:09:03,630
it's real.
It's in space.

1564
01:09:03,631 --> 01:09:08,220
It's orbiting the fucking earth.
There's flight patterns that are

1565
01:09:08,221 --> 01:09:12,630
carefully calculated that are going
around the earth.

1566
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:17,790
Everybody would have to be lying.
Do you understand how crazy it is?

1567
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:23,090
I'm with Ya on a lot of conspiracies.
I'm with you on operation northwoods.

1568
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:26,790
I'm with you on the Gulf of Tonkin.
Shit.

1569
01:09:26,791 --> 01:09:29,340
He'd get me high enough.
I'll go area 51 on you.

1570
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,240
I'll go.
Bob was our,

1571
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,200
I'll go,
I'll,

1572
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:33,990
I'll,
I'll go deep on some what?

1573
01:09:33,991 --> 01:09:36,120
Who the fuck knows?
Wacky Shit.

1574
01:09:37,530 --> 01:09:40,200
Take it to the earth being flat and
that's when I go,

1575
01:09:40,201 --> 01:09:43,260
you're just chasing your tail.
You're chasing your fucking tail.

1576
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:47,380
Angry little pricks.
Call me a shill.

1577
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:50,500
They're just showing you around her and
she'll share it on what a perfect,

1578
01:09:50,501 --> 01:09:52,120
perfect advertising is.
Advertising.

1579
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:57,121
Show jamie.com [inaudible] dot com give
yourself a round earth shill tee-shirt

1580
01:09:57,370 --> 01:10:00,580
votes and I have one done by Christmas
and they're very soft cotton.

1581
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:03,970
It feels wonderful on this camp.
Yeah,

1582
01:10:03,971 --> 01:10:06,790
I think it's almost like a troll man.
I'm telling you.

1583
01:10:06,791 --> 01:10:09,280
I used to think that too.
It started out as a troll.

1584
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:13,450
This is what I think happened.
I think it became an exercise in

1585
01:10:13,451 --> 01:10:16,790
psychology from what I've understood.
One of understood,

1586
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:20,530
and I might be wrong,
but from what little I've done poking

1587
01:10:20,531 --> 01:10:24,250
around about this,
it seems like it's might've started on

1588
01:10:24,251 --> 01:10:29,050
four Chan and it might've started as a
joke that there's always been a certain

1589
01:10:29,051 --> 01:10:32,410
percentage of people that believed that
the world was flat.

1590
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:35,770
There's always a certain percentage,
just like there's a certain percentage

1591
01:10:35,771 --> 01:10:36,604
of moonies.

1592
01:10:36,850 --> 01:10:39,690
There's a certain percentage of people
that you know are Satan,

1593
01:10:39,691 --> 01:10:40,870
watch Brazil.
People just,

1594
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:44,980
there's wacky beliefs and people get
attached to these wacky beliefs and they

1595
01:10:44,981 --> 01:10:46,580
fucking clean tim,
Matt,

1596
01:10:46,930 --> 01:10:49,090
and to say in whatever it is,
whatever,

1597
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:52,000
whatever the belief is,
there's a certain percentage of people

1598
01:10:52,001 --> 01:10:53,290
that have always thought the earth was
flat,

1599
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:58,590
but then what I read was it someone on
four chance started trolling and that by

1600
01:10:58,961 --> 01:11:03,010
trolling and trying to post this fake
evidence about the world being flat,

1601
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:07,510
a bunch of people bought it and they ran
with it and not only do they run with

1602
01:11:07,511 --> 01:11:09,160
it,
they started to ramp it up and add

1603
01:11:09,161 --> 01:11:13,080
things to it and flat earth theory
became a thing and these people all

1604
01:11:13,081 --> 01:11:15,540
decided that this was like a legitimate
pursuit.

1605
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:18,330
That there is some Illuminati,
some group of Jews.

1606
01:11:18,331 --> 01:11:22,200
It's always Jews that are hiding all the
information that somehow or another

1607
01:11:22,201 --> 01:11:23,730
they've talked.
All the map makers,

1608
01:11:23,731 --> 01:11:25,380
all the people that work in commercial
shipping,

1609
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,180
all the people that are flying
airplanes,

1610
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:29,070
all the people that are making
satellites.

1611
01:11:29,071 --> 01:11:31,170
Anyone in aerospace,
all these fucking people,

1612
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:36,360
all these people,
all these people are all together and

1613
01:11:36,361 --> 01:11:37,560
they're all lying.
Okay.

1614
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:38,580
And I am.
I am too.

1615
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:43,200
Or maybe just listen to this.
Maybe you're chasing you're fucking tail

1616
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:46,170
and you confuse the shit out of some
people that are dumber than you because

1617
01:11:46,171 --> 01:11:50,850
of your inability to look at what it is
versus what you want it to be.

1618
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:57,780
You heard me?
I'm not writing about everything.

1619
01:11:58,200 --> 01:11:59,390
Don't get me wrong.
You're fucking,

1620
01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:03,090
I'm right about this.
There's no fucking reason why someone

1621
01:12:03,091 --> 01:12:05,760
would lie about the shape of the planet.
There's no benefit in it.

1622
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:09,960
There's no reason why anybody would
conceal that information.

1623
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:14,370
There's no benefit.
If someone found out the earth was flat,

1624
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:17,490
they would be fucking singing it from
the rooftops.

1625
01:12:17,610 --> 01:12:22,440
And he real scientist and he real person
has been in the space station and he

1626
01:12:22,441 --> 01:12:25,140
real person flying a space shuttle.
They're real.

1627
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,460
I know you're a girl.
You don't know him.

1628
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:28,620
I've met him.
I had that,

1629
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:30,330
uh,
Chris Conrad Guy.

1630
01:12:30,331 --> 01:12:31,380
Is that his name?
Chris Hadfield.

1631
01:12:31,381 --> 01:12:33,120
Chris Hatfield.
I forgot his fucking name.

1632
01:12:33,121 --> 01:12:35,250
Commander Chris.
I blamed the weed.

1633
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:37,560
Chris Hadfield.
He was wonderful.

1634
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:39,840
He was in space for a long time.
It's talking about the effects of it

1635
01:12:39,841 --> 01:12:43,140
when he came down and how it,
how bad it fucked up his body.

1636
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:45,840
That was a fascinating podcast.
I remember had,

1637
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:48,150
I think I got like 40 minutes with them.
Then he had to go.

1638
01:12:48,151 --> 01:12:51,050
It's like one of those quick little
things and he was amazing.

1639
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:55,050
You're talking to a guy,
it's been circling the fucking planet in

1640
01:12:55,051 --> 01:12:56,940
a metal box.
No,

1641
01:12:56,941 --> 01:12:58,500
let's do it real.
It's real.

1642
01:12:58,590 --> 01:12:59,460
No,
it is real.

1643
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:02,400
This is the reason why your phone works.
Understand this.

1644
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:04,860
The people,
this is what's ironic.

1645
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:09,360
The people that are doubting the highest
minds and the most competent

1646
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:14,340
technological innovators in the world,
like the most competent people are the

1647
01:13:14,341 --> 01:13:17,280
people that are involved in like
aerospace,

1648
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:21,260
airplane construction,
jet pack,

1649
01:13:21,261 --> 01:13:24,660
construction,
cell phones,

1650
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:28,800
computers.
Those are the people that are at the top

1651
01:13:28,801 --> 01:13:33,801
of the fucking heap and these apes that
are using these devices to say that the

1652
01:13:35,041 --> 01:13:39,060
world is flat.
You're doing just what a massive

1653
01:13:39,061 --> 01:13:42,060
disservice you're doing to the very
minds that have created the thing that

1654
01:13:42,061 --> 01:13:46,200
you're using to complain with this
ridiculous idea that someone's hiding

1655
01:13:46,201 --> 01:13:50,550
the information from all the people
because they don't want you to know that

1656
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:52,800
the world is like your phone.
Man,

1657
01:13:54,690 --> 01:13:56,970
I get it.
I want to believe big foot's real.

1658
01:13:57,030 --> 01:14:01,300
I get it.
I want to believe if you show me some

1659
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:03,270
fucking half ass big foot footage,
I'll watch it three,

1660
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,790
four times in a row.
I'll go one day.

1661
01:14:05,791 --> 01:14:06,331
Maybe,
maybe,

1662
01:14:06,331 --> 01:14:07,164
maybe.
Hey,

1663
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:09,030
you never know.
There's a lot of parts of the world we

1664
01:14:09,031 --> 01:14:11,260
never go to,
and also more deep in the Congo.

1665
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,760
I wouldn't be surprised,
right?

1666
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:16,180
I want to believe,
but I'm also objective.

1667
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:19,690
You gotta be both.
I know you want to believe the earth is

1668
01:14:19,691 --> 01:14:21,220
flat.
I'm super sorry,

1669
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:24,670
but it appears to be round as fuck.
Just like every other planet we've ever

1670
01:14:24,671 --> 01:14:26,290
looked at.
All of them.

1671
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,780
Imagine how crazy would be if earth was
flat.

1672
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:30,850
Well,
here's the problem with this idea.

1673
01:14:30,851 --> 01:14:33,500
You fucking dummies.
A lot of the people behind this idea

1674
01:14:33,530 --> 01:14:36,400
believed that it was created by God,
like on a pizza tray.

1675
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:42,450
Like this is part of a religious belief
is that God made this flat earth and the

1676
01:14:42,791 --> 01:14:46,090
cosmos and it's all about us.
This is part of it.

1677
01:14:46,091 --> 01:14:47,800
This is,
this is a connected to your group,

1678
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:50,950
Julie.
You're so arrogant with your idea.

1679
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:52,510
No,
I'm fucking dumb.

1680
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:55,410
Okay.
But I'm smart enough to know the world

1681
01:14:55,411 --> 01:14:57,400
is round crazy assholes.

1682
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:01,880
Have you talked about net new Trenton
neutered trouty

1683
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:05,090
net new neutered and trout trout.
Yeah.

1684
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:08,300
You know,
I saw mark Cuban saying positive things

1685
01:15:08,301 --> 01:15:10,940
about nick net neutrality and I was
really surprised,

1686
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,040
but then I realized he's a rich old
white guy.

1687
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:15,260
And if I was a rich old white guy,
be like,

1688
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:16,730
listen,
we don't need regulation.

1689
01:15:16,910 --> 01:15:19,700
We took care of Arizona,
we clean up our own neighborhood.

1690
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,920
He also has a lot of money.
So no matter how much it costs,

1691
01:15:22,921 --> 01:15:24,120
he doesn't give a shit.
You know,

1692
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:26,520
there's that for sure.
But then,

1693
01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:28,980
um,
he was making some arguments and I'm too

1694
01:15:28,981 --> 01:15:30,630
fucking stupid to know what their
nineties right.

1695
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:31,781
You know,
I've,

1696
01:15:31,781 --> 01:15:35,760
I've heard the arguments against it and
I think those make the most sense.

1697
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:39,270
But apparently there's some big business
people and a lot of,

1698
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:40,840
I get your hippies,
Yolo drove.

1699
01:15:40,841 --> 01:15:42,810
Of course there are those fucking
aerosols.

1700
01:15:42,930 --> 01:15:44,640
They never have enough money.
You're right,

1701
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:50,060
you're right.
But also like you got to let them,

1702
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:52,920
you've got to let them do their thing.
You know,

1703
01:15:52,921 --> 01:15:55,080
you've got to let them do their thing.
It's like I,

1704
01:15:56,190 --> 01:16:01,190
I don't know who's right and I would
love to hear a really educated objective

1705
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:07,260
analysis on whether or not that enhances
competition or hurts it,

1706
01:16:07,410 --> 01:16:09,750
whether or not that's good for business
or bad for it.

1707
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,850
Most of the stuff that I read says it's
bad for it,

1708
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,350
but I need to look at it really closely.

1709
01:16:13,450 --> 01:16:17,730
It's definitely letting them censor the
internet and that's like,

1710
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,560
like what is the exact restrictions?
Do you know?

1711
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,130
Um,
it's,

1712
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:24,280
it's up to the ISP to be too,
like,

1713
01:16:24,281 --> 01:16:25,930
hey,
you want this website?

1714
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:28,900
We might give it to you.
They said they can start editing stuff.

1715
01:16:28,901 --> 01:16:33,460
Say as an example via Viacom who is
owned by Time Warner or whatever.

1716
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,760
Cause they like something comes out
against the CEO of time warmer.

1717
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:39,960
They can actually go in and edit the
Internet where it's nice.

1718
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:42,520
See Right now it's free.
You can do whatever the fuck you want

1719
01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:44,290
it.
No one's editing it really,

1720
01:16:44,291 --> 01:16:46,060
you know,
unless it's like peto websites or

1721
01:16:46,061 --> 01:16:46,894
something like that.
Right.

1722
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:49,780
But uh,
so it's going to be like in the future,

1723
01:16:49,781 --> 01:16:51,760
like we're China.
If they don't want you to go to my

1724
01:16:51,761 --> 01:16:52,720
space,
China will be like

1725
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:55,780
soft dude.
I was reading about a Vietnamese blogger

1726
01:16:55,781 --> 01:16:59,290
today who was sentenced for seven years
in jail,

1727
01:16:59,470 --> 01:17:02,320
a 22 year old Vietnamese blogger.
Um,

1728
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:05,070
it was in the New York Times.
Um,

1729
01:17:05,230 --> 01:17:08,920
he was writing about an oil spill and
they said that he was,

1730
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:11,480
uh,
talking negative and you doing

1731
01:17:11,481 --> 01:17:15,830
propaganda against the state.
They locked them in jail for seven years

1732
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:21,550
for doing journalism on an oil spill and
for pointing the blame at the government

1733
01:17:22,821 --> 01:17:25,070
or whoever the fuck was responsible for
the oil spill.

1734
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:29,270
She's 10 years.
Did lockman dl for 10 years because

1735
01:17:29,271 --> 01:17:30,830
somebody wrote an article now a
different one.

1736
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:32,480
That's the girl.
That's a girl.

1737
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:35,030
That's another one.
She's from earlier in the year I went,

1738
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:36,250
I went deep.
Dude,

1739
01:17:36,270 --> 01:17:38,120
there,
they're locking bloggers up over there.

1740
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:44,200
Vietnam apparently they have great good
issues with like gay rights and you

1741
01:17:45,681 --> 01:17:47,870
know,
a lot of progressive ideas that we

1742
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:53,260
subscribe to in this country,
but they do not tolerate criticism like

1743
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:58,370
it's apparently in that way very
totalitarian and that if you do

1744
01:17:58,371 --> 01:18:01,040
criticize them in the form of like
propaganda,

1745
01:18:01,041 --> 01:18:03,770
like blogs against them,
they'll lock you in a fucking cage for

1746
01:18:03,771 --> 01:18:04,640
like a decade.

1747
01:18:05,330 --> 01:18:07,880
It's scary.
We've got to really appreciate,

1748
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:09,130
this is one of the reasons why,
I mean,

1749
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:11,210
I don't know if trump understands this.
I guess he does,

1750
01:18:11,211 --> 01:18:13,460
but he doesn't give a fuck.
I think his idea is like,

1751
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:15,530
you're going against me fucking,
I'm going against you.

1752
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:16,700
Fuck you.
CNN.

1753
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:20,390
You know I get it.
But by just like completely deriding

1754
01:18:20,391 --> 01:18:21,300
them like that,
like you,

1755
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:26,350
you run this risk of getting to a
position where there's not like this

1756
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:33,041
objective powerful force that's watching
over the president and reporting on all

1757
01:18:33,771 --> 01:18:35,180
of his actions.
Right.

1758
01:18:36,490 --> 01:18:40,640
This a chart that I read today though
that was a little disturbing and it was

1759
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:45,850
like a truth chart and it was like how
many times CNN has said things that were

1760
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:48,950
not true?
How many times does it have to correct

1761
01:18:48,951 --> 01:18:51,320
itself?
How many times did they say things that

1762
01:18:51,321 --> 01:18:53,880
are true?
And uh,

1763
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:57,050
I don't know if it's right.
I don't know if that,

1764
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,580
that might have been some horse shit
that I read,

1765
01:18:58,581 --> 01:18:59,840
but if it was right,
I was like,

1766
01:18:59,841 --> 01:19:01,880
whoa.
Are They Brung that often?

1767
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:05,360
Any News,
especially when it has breaking news

1768
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,490
guys,
it's at least they're correcting

1769
01:19:07,491 --> 01:19:09,560
themselves.
Where like our president won't correct

1770
01:19:09,561 --> 01:19:10,940
himself in.
True.

1771
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:11,853
That's good point.

1772
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:14,390
Maybe,
maybe that's what they mean by being

1773
01:19:14,391 --> 01:19:16,070
incorrect and that like,
you know,

1774
01:19:16,071 --> 01:19:18,140
the latest report says,
but it,

1775
01:19:18,141 --> 01:19:21,230
see that's just what the latest reports
as the latest report might not be.

1776
01:19:21,231 --> 01:19:23,440
Correct.
But if you say the,

1777
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:26,120
that's the latest report,
you're not wrong.

1778
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:29,170
You just don't have the right
information.

1779
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:30,730
Right.
And I think everyone knows that when

1780
01:19:30,731 --> 01:19:32,170
you're watching the news,
you know?

1781
01:19:32,410 --> 01:19:34,240
Right.
Like if something happens like some

1782
01:19:34,241 --> 01:19:35,980
crazy shooter type situation.
Right,

1783
01:19:36,010 --> 01:19:40,180
right.
It's just very dangerous when you see

1784
01:19:40,181 --> 01:19:44,200
the president and the free press going
after each other like that.

1785
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,940
So he tweeted today what

1786
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:50,140
he said,
we should have a contest as to which of

1787
01:19:50,141 --> 01:19:54,190
the networks plus CNN and not including
Fox is the most dishonest,

1788
01:19:54,191 --> 01:19:56,710
corrupt,
and or distorted and its political

1789
01:19:56,711 --> 01:20:00,340
coverage of your,
your favorite president in parentheses.

1790
01:20:00,341 --> 01:20:03,100
Me,
they're all bad winter to receive the

1791
01:20:03,101 --> 01:20:06,580
fake news trophy in all caps.
It's her fucking president.

1792
01:20:06,581 --> 01:20:08,250
Wow.
That's so weird.

1793
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:12,480
This is so weird because here's what's
weird.

1794
01:20:12,570 --> 01:20:16,290
It's not weird to think this,
but to broadcast that,

1795
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:20,050
to write that down and to put that on,
that's like that.

1796
01:20:20,051 --> 01:20:22,110
It's crazy.
That's a crazy thought.

1797
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:25,850
I think I would like him so much better
if he'd never tweeted like,

1798
01:20:25,870 --> 01:20:29,010
like if we just had news and that's it.
Yeah,

1799
01:20:29,011 --> 01:20:31,680
but you're getting to see like we were
talking about this,

1800
01:20:31,681 --> 01:20:34,470
the stress of this thing.
I mean this is how he's always been

1801
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:36,660
fires back at people when they fired
him.

1802
01:20:36,661 --> 01:20:37,860
That's his thing.
I mean,

1803
01:20:37,861 --> 01:20:40,670
should have known,
but people's for some reason expected

1804
01:20:40,671 --> 01:20:42,120
them to be different.
Once he got in there,

1805
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:43,081
they expected,
well,

1806
01:20:43,081 --> 01:20:44,970
he's just doing it for now.
Just trust me.

1807
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:47,100
It's going to get in there.
It's going to be super cool.

1808
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:50,610
All right.
Have you tried to Bait Bait him yet?

1809
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:52,310
Oh,
I don't want to get to bait him.

1810
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:53,031
No,
no,

1811
01:20:53,031 --> 01:20:54,940
no,
no desire.

1812
01:20:55,590 --> 01:21:00,240
I don't want to ever do that to anybody.
I just looked.

1813
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:02,880
This is the world that I'm seeing.
You know?

1814
01:21:02,881 --> 01:21:04,560
I'm just,
I'm reporting on what I'm seeing.

1815
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:06,180
I'm a reporter.
I'm like a journalist.

1816
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:11,130
That's what I'm seeing.
I'm seeing a bunch of like whether

1817
01:21:11,131 --> 01:21:13,660
they're justified or not,
there's,

1818
01:21:13,670 --> 01:21:18,270
there's a bunch of this pettiness,
this all that should be avoided by

1819
01:21:18,271 --> 01:21:22,110
advanced human beings.
That's what's the problem is the lack of

1820
01:21:22,111 --> 01:21:26,190
humor to it all and the,
the angry pettiness of it all is what's

1821
01:21:26,191 --> 01:21:28,800
most disturbing.
Not the idea that something wrong with

1822
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:31,920
this system because if that chart was
right and a wrong a lot and if they're

1823
01:21:31,921 --> 01:21:34,140
wrong about him,
that's there's one thing,

1824
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:37,020
but the,
the way that that should be handled as

1825
01:21:37,021 --> 01:21:42,021
always pointing out exactly and
specifically how they were wrong,

1826
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:45,090
how it could have gotten back to them.

1827
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:48,030
That was the wrong information and what
they've done to correct it.

1828
01:21:48,031 --> 01:21:51,510
If they have it,
acknowledge it and then that's it.

1829
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,460
Like that's,
that's what should be done when you're

1830
01:21:53,461 --> 01:21:56,610
in that position,
when you're just a regular dude and you

1831
01:21:56,611 --> 01:22:00,030
want to just go on twitter and talk some
crazy shit and you know,

1832
01:22:00,031 --> 01:22:03,150
say the sooner is fucking fake news.
It feels like some firefighters

1833
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:04,470
somewhere.
I don't think she'd be fired.

1834
01:22:04,471 --> 01:22:07,470
If you say that,
like I don't care that you can say that.

1835
01:22:07,471 --> 01:22:09,180
Right.
It doesn't bother me when you're the

1836
01:22:09,181 --> 01:22:10,890
president,
you got to go,

1837
01:22:10,891 --> 01:22:13,640
come on man.
You definitely are.

1838
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:19,250
You're setting an example like is as
weird as that seems to say to someone

1839
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:22,200
that like this is a part of the job.
You have to set a good example.

1840
01:22:22,201 --> 01:22:23,760
You can't,
you're setting the tone of the country.

1841
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:24,930
That's the problem.

1842
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:26,940
Like I wouldn't write that.
Would you write that?

1843
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:29,640
You write that to somebody's never fake
news.

1844
01:22:29,641 --> 01:22:31,620
Trophy exclamation points.
So come on.

1845
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:33,010
I hate it.
That's crazy.

1846
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:35,940
And whoever let you do that needs to get
you some mushrooms and have you seen as

1847
01:22:35,941 --> 01:22:39,060
boomerangs,
like a boomerang and his snapchat.

1848
01:22:39,390 --> 01:22:40,320
Oh,
we have snapchat.

1849
01:22:40,370 --> 01:22:43,220
I'm just kidding.
Imagine though,

1850
01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:45,480
if Tega you had,
that would be hilarious if he did.

1851
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:47,130
Uh,
you know,

1852
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:49,750
people get tired of all this anti trump
stuff and you know,

1853
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:51,240
people get tired of just hearing the
subject.

1854
01:22:51,241 --> 01:22:53,130
It's almost like just,
it hurts them.

1855
01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:54,810
But those,
those kinds of things,

1856
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:57,960
that's like fuel for the fire.
It's almost like he's doing,

1857
01:22:58,620 --> 01:23:01,010
he's doing the work of the people hate
him for him.

1858
01:23:01,830 --> 01:23:05,530
He just keeps providing more and more
ridiculous shit.

1859
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:06,130
Do you think

1860
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:07,690
trump is,
he get mad at him for,

1861
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,790
do you think trump's a flat earth
earthers no.

1862
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:13,600
No.
I mean some of that probably a look,

1863
01:23:13,601 --> 01:23:15,190
man.
I would like to know what he thinks

1864
01:23:15,191 --> 01:23:17,320
about Kennedy,
but he keeps releasing these documents

1865
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,050
and I'm happy.
Um,

1866
01:23:19,090 --> 01:23:21,670
and some of these documents are crazy.
You know,

1867
01:23:21,671 --> 01:23:25,300
they've um,
there's a lot of like,

1868
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:29,620
one of the ones was about Jack Ruby,
Jack Ruby saying the day that Kennedy

1869
01:23:29,621 --> 01:23:33,010
was going to get shot a get ready,
going to see some fireworks today.

1870
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:37,930
Like what?
Like what did he really say?

1871
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:40,420
Like how do I know he really said that I
want to know.

1872
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:41,860
I really,
I really owe it.

1873
01:23:41,861 --> 01:23:46,390
But if the FBI got it from a credible
source and that they really believed

1874
01:23:46,391 --> 01:23:49,810
that the problem is like the people that
Jack Ruby was hanging around with some

1875
01:23:49,811 --> 01:23:53,410
crazy stripper is doing like some 1960s
version of speed.

1876
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:54,783
Yeah.
He told me,

1877
01:23:54,910 --> 01:23:56,650
he told me fireworks was going to
happen.

1878
01:23:56,830 --> 01:23:59,170
Yeah.
And then she runs off into the fucking

1879
01:23:59,171 --> 01:24:03,010
forest it where the fuck knows.
Maybe check Ruby just had like a nice

1880
01:24:03,011 --> 01:24:08,011
party surprise party later could have
going to set off president got shot.

1881
01:24:09,791 --> 01:24:13,060
What would be the best evidence that you
would need right now to like know that

1882
01:24:13,061 --> 01:24:14,740
that was true?
That's a good question,

1883
01:24:15,070 --> 01:24:17,230
right,
because I've seen people argue that the

1884
01:24:17,231 --> 01:24:21,820
photo of Lee Harvey Oswald is convenient
photo of him in the backyard with a

1885
01:24:21,821 --> 01:24:24,880
rifle in one hand,
a newspaper and the other hand that is

1886
01:24:24,881 --> 01:24:26,590
photo shopped,
not photoshop,

1887
01:24:26,591 --> 01:24:28,930
but photo edited is,
I don't know if it is,

1888
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,940
I don't know if it is.
I don't know if it's been proven that it

1889
01:24:30,941 --> 01:24:32,440
is,
but I know that that's a common

1890
01:24:32,441 --> 01:24:35,380
statement and then if people have
broken,

1891
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:38,980
they've done some analysis on the
photograph and I do not know enough

1892
01:24:38,981 --> 01:24:40,870
about photography to know whether or not
they're right.

1893
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:43,930
The shadows are all off.
I think that they found out that they,

1894
01:24:43,931 --> 01:24:48,931
the magazine did it too for some reason,
like at the magazine did it not like the

1895
01:24:49,091 --> 01:24:52,450
government or anything.
Maybe I remember it being a

1896
01:24:52,451 --> 01:24:54,910
controversial photo,
but then I remember someone saying

1897
01:24:54,911 --> 01:24:59,911
recently that they believe it was not
faked and that there was new evidence to

1898
01:24:59,951 --> 01:25:02,620
indicate that it was not fixed.
It's just the problem with being like a

1899
01:25:03,190 --> 01:25:05,050
surface reader.
Yes.

1900
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,000
The one in the far left.
Yeah.

1901
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:10,660
That's a Dallas police reenactment.
Yeah.

1902
01:25:10,661 --> 01:25:12,190
How do you know that?
They're the exact same time?

1903
01:25:12,191 --> 01:25:14,470
You don't have a camera when he was come
on stupid.

1904
01:25:15,130 --> 01:25:18,400
You can't take a photograph as a
reenactment unless you know exactly when

1905
01:25:18,401 --> 01:25:21,840
he took the photograph and you have the
same clouds in the sky and shit cause

1906
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,710
they're,
I guess they're trying to like find out

1907
01:25:23,711 --> 01:25:28,360
whether or not that was a real photo or
whether it was Lee Harvey Oswald's head

1908
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:33,660
put on somebody else's body,
but the body matched his body go to

1909
01:25:34,390 --> 01:25:38,080
focusing on his face.
Don't go to this one.

1910
01:25:38,081 --> 01:25:39,580
There's one,
there's one that's like a better

1911
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:41,400
resolution version.
Right?

1912
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:43,240
You go to the one right above it
actually

1913
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,710
without him right there.
Yeah.

1914
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:48,160
Yeah.
That's the photo.

1915
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:53,580
It looks a little off like the head
definitely looks a little weird head.

1916
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:57,610
I guess the shadows is what they're
talking about.

1917
01:25:57,630 --> 01:26:01,570
The shadow that's coming from the bottom
of his Chin's not the same as what the

1918
01:26:01,571 --> 01:26:02,530
shadow is,
blah,

1919
01:26:02,531 --> 01:26:03,050
blah,
blah.

1920
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:03,960
On this feet.
Oh no

1921
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,170
ma'am.
I'm not smart enough to know whether or

1922
01:26:06,171 --> 01:26:07,880
not that's true,
but it looks okay to me,

1923
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:11,090
but it's so grainy.
Let's look at that photo.

1924
01:26:11,091 --> 01:26:12,770
Imagine if that was,
but pictures are today.

1925
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,630
I can,
you had to check out a girl's tinder

1926
01:26:14,631 --> 01:26:15,380
account.
You'd be like,

1927
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:19,120
hmm,
what do you really look like this?

1928
01:26:19,510 --> 01:26:22,010
I've seen there's the full wine now.
Now Look,

1929
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:25,340
look at his feet like zoom out of Louis
is his feet shadows.

1930
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:26,600
See what we see it.
There we go.

1931
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:30,620
See how the shadow is going that way on
his feet and then if you look at his

1932
01:26:30,621 --> 01:26:32,420
face,
the shad is like kinda going to make

1933
01:26:32,421 --> 01:26:34,520
that picture of the smallest.
We can get the whole picture in there.

1934
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,000
Yeah,

1935
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,620
something like that.
I don't think that's correct.

1936
01:26:40,770 --> 01:26:43,440
The thing that would make me feel like
something was weird

1937
01:26:45,170 --> 01:26:49,280
is just that it's so old that you
couldn't really tell whether or not

1938
01:26:49,281 --> 01:26:51,980
someone doctored it and they might have
had reason to doctorate.

1939
01:26:52,010 --> 01:26:54,290
That's it.
That's what makes me think that it might

1940
01:26:54,291 --> 01:26:56,630
be fucked with not the actual picture
itself.

1941
01:26:56,870 --> 01:26:59,960
When I'm looking at the picture itself,
I'm trying to find reasons why it was

1942
01:26:59,961 --> 01:27:00,830
fucked with,
you know,

1943
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:02,840
but then again,
I'm losing,

1944
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:04,490
I know Jack Shit,
I recreation.

1945
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:05,710
Oh,
you guys

1946
01:27:07,690 --> 01:27:08,590
just tell you right now,
there isn't,

1947
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:12,410
that guy tells boring stories.
Oh,

1948
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:14,360
that was legendary.
Half beyond.

1949
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:18,640
That was jock Louie.
He was depressed and he made fun of him.

1950
01:27:18,641 --> 01:27:20,540
Your stupid fucking buck up.
Sorry.

1951
01:27:21,410 --> 01:27:23,090
Sorry in advance.
I'm just joking.

1952
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:26,270
I'm sure that guy has great stories,
but that those days,

1953
01:27:26,271 --> 01:27:27,650
man,
you'd get away with a lot of shit.

1954
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:30,260
You know,
there's an interesting article that,

1955
01:27:30,261 --> 01:27:31,094
uh,
David,

1956
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:33,260
what's his name,
David from,

1957
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:36,920
from the,
he's a a conservative writer,

1958
01:27:38,630 --> 01:27:42,200
New York Times bestselling author.
He wrote something about it.

1959
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:44,000
Shit.
I'm trying to remember what it was.

1960
01:27:44,210 --> 01:27:48,500
Oh,
it was Richard Nixon's letter to,

1961
01:27:48,710 --> 01:27:49,610
uh,
JFK,

1962
01:27:49,611 --> 01:27:53,210
his widow.
It's like heartfelt articulate,

1963
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:59,320
interesting letter between an opponent
of John F.

1964
01:27:59,870 --> 01:28:02,410
Kennedy
and Richard Nixon.

1965
01:28:02,411 --> 01:28:03,820
I mean that,
that's who he was.

1966
01:28:03,821 --> 01:28:06,370
The opponent of John F.
Kennedy wasn't just Richard Nixon,

1967
01:28:06,790 --> 01:28:08,800
like they were running against each
other.

1968
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:12,400
And so he writes this like really
heartfelt letter and it's like,

1969
01:28:12,401 --> 01:28:13,570
Whoa,
you read it and you'll out.

1970
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:15,450
Wow.
Which it,

1971
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:17,640
Nixon wasn't as stupid as people want.
Think he was.

1972
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:21,370
He was very smart of course,
but just was fucked up.

1973
01:28:23,650 --> 01:28:25,450
I think this job just does it to
everybody.

1974
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:28,450
I don't think anybody gets gets out of
this one alive.

1975
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:30,170
I mean,
look at Donald Trump's hair.

1976
01:28:30,171 --> 01:28:32,530
It's already getting kind of white like,
yeah,

1977
01:28:32,531 --> 01:28:35,440
but it's all painted and who knows what
the real car that stuff is.

1978
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:36,910
That's true.
It's probably all white.

1979
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:38,200
He's probably just given up.
Fuck it.

1980
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:41,560
Not going in today like Switzer.
Today's die day.

1981
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:44,170
No,
now it says cheetos and the couch day.

1982
01:28:44,171 --> 01:28:46,250
Fuck you golf.
I'm going to watch Fox News and they

1983
01:28:46,251 --> 01:28:49,330
gonna tell me on awesome.
He just sits there stroking it,

1984
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:52,450
watching Fox News.
Fox News loves him.

1985
01:28:52,810 --> 01:28:57,790
It's interesting to see white one one
network just going full gung Ho we're

1986
01:28:57,791 --> 01:29:00,470
going to go trump all the way.
And I supposedly,

1987
01:29:00,490 --> 01:29:02,280
that's why he's getting involved

1988
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:06,060
with that merger of Time Warner or
whatever to get rid of CNN or something.

1989
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:07,140
So,
so god,

1990
01:29:07,290 --> 01:29:09,310
that's crazy if that really happens.
Yeah,

1991
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:10,240
that's the idea,
right?

1992
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:13,800
Like Time Magazine's being bought out a
t and t is trying to buy time Warner,

1993
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:15,960
the whole company or something.
Dude,

1994
01:29:15,970 --> 01:29:18,780
these gigantic companies.
See the thing is,

1995
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:22,700
I don't know shit about this,
um,

1996
01:29:23,070 --> 01:29:24,660
net neutrality thing.
I don't,

1997
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:29,010
I need to know more about it because I
need to know if in some way,

1998
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:33,450
here's the real scary thing that
everyone who owns a giant company would

1999
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:38,370
be able to control their own internet.
Like you would have like a network,

2000
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:41,490
like you would be on,
you'd be on the verizon Internet thing

2001
01:29:41,491 --> 01:29:43,140
and he'd be on comcast like,
oh,

2002
01:29:43,141 --> 01:29:44,260
you're on comcast.
Ah,

2003
01:29:44,261 --> 01:29:46,050
you can't go to my website,
Shit.

2004
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:49,290
Yeah,
that's what we don't want them.

2005
01:29:50,430 --> 01:29:51,031
There's,
there's a,

2006
01:29:51,031 --> 01:29:53,460
there's an article I tweeted the other
day where on the,

2007
01:29:53,461 --> 01:29:55,340
I think la times or something like that
word,

2008
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:58,770
somebody,
a woman who works for the FCC a row.

2009
01:29:58,800 --> 01:29:59,401
Like,
like,

2010
01:29:59,401 --> 01:30:01,500
please don't let us do this.
You know,

2011
01:30:01,501 --> 01:30:02,334
like,
oh,

2012
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:03,880
I read that.
And there's,

2013
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:05,850
there's a website you can go to where
it's automated,

2014
01:30:05,851 --> 01:30:09,930
where you can put in your information
and we'll write an email or a letter to

2015
01:30:10,170 --> 01:30:12,180
the FCC.
So I recommend doing that.

2016
01:30:12,181 --> 01:30:13,170
I mean there's,
there's,

2017
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:15,680
I think we have like 10 days til they
vote on this.

2018
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:16,910
That's what's crazy.
Is this,

2019
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:19,470
this should be something cause this is a
very important issue.

2020
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:22,710
This should be something that's debated
on prime time television.

2021
01:30:22,740 --> 01:30:23,830
Absolutely.
It needs to,

2022
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:26,160
it really should be.
I mean all of these kind of really

2023
01:30:26,190 --> 01:30:27,590
crucial,
crucial,

2024
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:30,390
this is where you stop listening to me,
her shoulder memory,

2025
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:34,230
all of these crucial issues,
they should all be discussed in the,

2026
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:37,740
like the public forum.
They should be discussed in like the,

2027
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:41,850
the center of the town.
That's what the show should be like.

2028
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:43,920
What CNN and any of these shows should
be.

2029
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:49,200
Part of what they should be is like a
town center where people talk about

2030
01:30:49,201 --> 01:30:52,680
these like super important ideas.
This is an important idea that needs to

2031
01:30:52,681 --> 01:30:56,730
be like they need to interrupt
television shows for this because we

2032
01:30:56,731 --> 01:31:01,731
might be signing off on a terrible idea
and we might be letting companies get

2033
01:31:01,981 --> 01:31:03,780
away with having more and more control
over us.

2034
01:31:03,781 --> 01:31:05,010
I don't know.
I need to go look at it.

2035
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,770
I need to really look at it carefully,
but we all need to look at it carefully.

2036
01:31:07,771 --> 01:31:10,670
If this is really happening in 10 days,
the average person's not going to have

2037
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:13,560
the time nor the ambition to go and
investigate this.

2038
01:31:13,590 --> 01:31:14,910
Yeah,
scary.

2039
01:31:14,911 --> 01:31:16,220
Think Jamie.
As I was looking,

2040
01:31:16,230 --> 01:31:17,970
there's it.
There's another thing that happened too

2041
01:31:17,971 --> 01:31:20,460
that they're voting on I think this
week.

2042
01:31:20,461 --> 01:31:21,750
Monsters,
the PR.

2043
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:24,840
Another problem I have it is too,
there's five people on that panel of the

2044
01:31:24,841 --> 01:31:29,310
FCC board that decides these decisions.
It's usually one person that's the

2045
01:31:29,311 --> 01:31:31,140
flipping vote that makes it a three two
vote.

2046
01:31:31,141 --> 01:31:34,200
It's never like five of which one showed
up and the solid gold Bentley,

2047
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:39,780
which one got out his next covered in
lipstick.

2048
01:31:40,670 --> 01:31:42,690
This guy,
he's the analysis,

2049
01:31:42,890 --> 01:31:46,650
but the FCC wants to relax when a
broadcast media as big as rules that has

2050
01:31:46,651 --> 01:31:51,030
to do with like a small,
like a small city having one company

2051
01:31:51,031 --> 01:31:54,600
owned the TV station and a newspaper in
that area,

2052
01:31:54,601 --> 01:31:56,790
which is like a media rights issue.
Oh.

2053
01:31:56,791 --> 01:31:58,950
So they want that to come back there.
They're trying to,

2054
01:31:59,110 --> 01:32:00,180
yeah,
stop the rule

2055
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:03,610
that prevented that or like re Redo the
vote on it or whatever.

2056
01:32:03,611 --> 01:32:04,444
But um,

2057
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:06,610
I get that rule.
I get that rule.

2058
01:32:06,611 --> 01:32:09,390
But the problem is like if you're,
you want to open,

2059
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:11,290
I mean it's also,
I get the idea that you should be able

2060
01:32:11,291 --> 01:32:13,540
to open as many companies as you want.
There should be some sort of fair

2061
01:32:13,541 --> 01:32:14,374
competition.

2062
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:17,860
But the problem with like fair
competition in the news,

2063
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:22,090
it's like in the news,
you don't always want to get the most

2064
01:32:22,091 --> 01:32:24,730
ratings.
Like you want to like report like an

2065
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:25,600
APP,
like,

2066
01:32:25,601 --> 01:32:29,120
uh,
an honest account of all the issues that

2067
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:31,420
are actually happening.
But you can't do that if you want to

2068
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:34,210
sell ads.
You gotta he gotta be spicy.

2069
01:32:34,390 --> 01:32:36,250
You've got to go to that fucking fire
quick,

2070
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:37,510
get to that fire.
Let's see.

2071
01:32:37,511 --> 01:32:41,170
Let's see the car accident.
Chase's please chase the shit.

2072
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:43,750
We interrupt this basketball game to
show you a guy that's never gotten away

2073
01:32:43,751 --> 01:32:45,460
from the cops.
Said that's what you see,

2074
01:32:45,461 --> 01:32:49,230
the Oregon one.
You know what I'm talking about there.

2075
01:32:49,270 --> 01:32:53,350
There's one in Oregon than recently.
And it was the craziest thing ever.

2076
01:32:53,351 --> 01:32:58,120
He was like going through a fields,
Oklahoma to him,

2077
01:32:58,121 --> 01:33:01,230
Oregon told them ost data stuff.
I'm not going to,

2078
01:33:01,590 --> 01:33:02,980
wow.
There's a show called out.

2079
01:33:02,981 --> 01:33:04,900
I was gonna bring it up a second ago
called shot in the dark.

2080
01:33:04,901 --> 01:33:07,600
It just came on Netflix.
It's sort of like the TV show version of

2081
01:33:07,601 --> 01:33:11,050
the night crawl or movie.
So it's following some news crews around

2082
01:33:11,051 --> 01:33:14,320
Los Angeles every night while they're
going to find these like crazy news

2083
01:33:14,321 --> 01:33:15,340
stories.
Wow.

2084
01:33:15,350 --> 01:33:18,250
And they actually,
the first episode that catch a parked

2085
01:33:18,251 --> 01:33:20,770
car on the 10 and uh,
they're like thinking a,

2086
01:33:20,830 --> 01:33:22,180
it's gonna be an accident can be real
bad.

2087
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:24,790
And literally like five seconds later,
boom.

2088
01:33:24,791 --> 01:33:28,060
Fireball guys to go save the guy pulled
him out of the burning car.

2089
01:33:28,330 --> 01:33:29,680
Whoa.
It was really intense.

2090
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:32,320
But that's what's happening all the time
too.

2091
01:33:32,321 --> 01:33:34,840
And the news that they're catching and
sell.

2092
01:33:34,841 --> 01:33:38,830
I saw it last night when I was watching
the news popped up is another thing,

2093
01:33:38,890 --> 01:33:42,700
a hostage situation.
But some guy got paid probably 500

2094
01:33:42,701 --> 01:33:44,500
bucks.
We're going to find video of this.

2095
01:33:44,501 --> 01:33:45,334
It's real weird.

2096
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:47,150
Do you ever see that night?
What?

2097
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:49,470
What does that movie nightcrawler.
Nightcrawler's yeah,

2098
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:52,160
that was a great movie man.
How dare you?

2099
01:33:52,990 --> 01:33:57,320
That's good guys.
All right away my movies and my past

2100
01:33:57,321 --> 01:33:58,920
Coco.
Have you seen coco yet?

2101
01:33:58,970 --> 01:34:00,620
There's Coco.
Coco is the,

2102
01:34:00,710 --> 01:34:03,950
um,
the new pixar movie with a,

2103
01:34:03,951 --> 01:34:06,800
it's all about the Mexican holiday day
of the dead,

2104
01:34:06,801 --> 01:34:07,601
you know,
and,

2105
01:34:07,601 --> 01:34:11,060
and all.
But I did see one other Mexican day of

2106
01:34:11,061 --> 01:34:13,880
the dead movie.
It was crazy where they went to this

2107
01:34:13,910 --> 01:34:16,820
other dimension.
That's Coco,

2108
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:18,950
but I saw this,
this the second one.

2109
01:34:19,010 --> 01:34:19,850
No,
this is the first one.

2110
01:34:19,851 --> 01:34:21,440
You might've saw it early though.
No,

2111
01:34:21,441 --> 01:34:24,170
I saw it on like it on Itunes,
on Apple TV.

2112
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:26,150
Oh,
there was another one that's

2113
01:34:26,151 --> 01:34:28,760
interesting.
There was another crazy ass movie with

2114
01:34:28,761 --> 01:34:30,740
day of the dead characters that I
watched recently.

2115
01:34:30,770 --> 01:34:32,090
A book of life.
That's it.

2116
01:34:32,091 --> 01:34:33,140
The book of life,
Dude.

2117
01:34:33,141 --> 01:34:35,630
It's fucking amazing.
You haven't seen this?

2118
01:34:35,690 --> 01:34:37,640
No.
Is that just like a trailer?

2119
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:42,280
Animation is fucking insane.
It's so why wait,

2120
01:34:42,290 --> 01:34:44,660
this is it.
So there's these like wooden people and

2121
01:34:44,661 --> 01:34:47,660
then they,
they get somehow or another taken into

2122
01:34:47,661 --> 01:34:50,180
this other dimension and then this other
dimension,

2123
01:34:50,181 --> 01:34:53,060
it's like tron drugs.
Man did this looks like the same

2124
01:34:53,061 --> 01:34:55,220
characters.
If no seat.

2125
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:57,920
This is like,
why is no one about this yet?

2126
01:34:58,340 --> 01:35:01,100
I have no idea.
This is sort of like when they did those

2127
01:35:01,101 --> 01:35:03,660
two,
what'd you go switching?

2128
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:06,760
What does this now here's the new one.
Yeah,

2129
01:35:06,770 --> 01:35:10,280
but go back to that one cause it didn't
quite get totally freaky yet.

2130
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,980
They start getting really freaky towards
the end.

2131
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:14,840
Wow.
It's Guillermo del Toro.

2132
01:35:14,870 --> 01:35:15,530
I,
yeah.

2133
01:35:15,530 --> 01:35:18,440
See this is where they,
they're entering into this other

2134
01:35:18,441 --> 01:35:21,290
dimension and everything is like super
bizarro.

2135
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:24,080
Like the people are weird.
It's really strange,

2136
01:35:24,081 --> 01:35:27,020
like everyone's dead.
It's so bizarre.

2137
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:30,960
And that's exactly what coke has a bad,
but it's like you remember that?

2138
01:35:30,961 --> 01:35:33,570
And when deep impact and Armageddon came
out the same time,

2139
01:35:34,110 --> 01:35:36,690
it's like it like somehow or another
somebody figured out like,

2140
01:35:36,691 --> 01:35:38,310
Hey,
these day that dead things are dope.

2141
01:35:38,311 --> 01:35:39,210
Look,
there's two other ones.

2142
01:35:39,211 --> 01:35:43,380
That volcano movie and then like Tommy
Lee Jones was in one and then Pierce

2143
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:45,270
Brosnan was in one,
but there were like two movies about

2144
01:35:45,271 --> 01:35:47,070
volcanoes and it came out like the same
week.

2145
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:49,260
Yeah.
They always do that in la.

2146
01:35:49,261 --> 01:35:51,600
And one was not once next earthquake
when we,

2147
01:35:51,601 --> 01:35:53,280
he's like,
look at this new dimension that he

2148
01:35:53,370 --> 01:35:54,650
enters into.
Sam,

2149
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:57,180
same shit.
This is the same shit.

2150
01:35:57,181 --> 01:35:58,580
It's exactly that.
That's,

2151
01:35:58,590 --> 01:36:01,530
I can't believe no one's talked about
this weird man.

2152
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:02,040
This is

2153
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:05,160
more dead people.
And the other one was more like bizarro

2154
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:08,490
weird bond.
This is pretty bizarro dead people.

2155
01:36:08,491 --> 01:36:09,324
I mean,
look at this.

2156
01:36:10,530 --> 01:36:12,600
Yeah.
It's like they find that like a bugs

2157
01:36:12,601 --> 01:36:14,690
bunny and you know,
whoa.

2158
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:19,700
We're going to have her own bunny are
bunny's name is Tim Gaffey and Donald.

2159
01:36:20,070 --> 01:36:21,990
Yeah.
Daffy duck and Donald Duck like,

2160
01:36:21,991 --> 01:36:23,010
hey,
which one was mark?

2161
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:27,580
Which one is warner brothers?
Which one of those Taffy Taffy guy more

2162
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:30,930
than a donald.
Donald's the Oji though.

2163
01:36:31,230 --> 01:36:33,570
And uh,
they were the only ones that had the

2164
01:36:33,571 --> 01:36:36,690
balls to have a hunter that like a bunch
of moon,

2165
01:36:37,290 --> 01:36:41,010
elmer fudd and then a bunch of other
mean hunters and some of their movies

2166
01:36:41,011 --> 01:36:42,720
like the Bambi movies,
a mean hunter.

2167
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:47,520
It's a bunch of other ones.
But the uh,

2168
01:36:48,390 --> 01:36:53,390
elmer fudd that was like the first dumb
white God you could mock in a cartoon,

2169
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:55,193
wasn't he?

2170
01:36:55,490 --> 01:36:57,260
No,
I think they had a lot of dumb white

2171
01:36:57,470 --> 01:36:58,400
people.
You can mock.

2172
01:36:58,650 --> 01:37:01,530
Is he the first and when we're filing
the rabbit gets away all the time.

2173
01:37:01,531 --> 01:37:04,380
The rabbit lake treats him like a bitch.
Like you fucking dummy.

2174
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:06,930
You're never going to get me.
Like he's never threatened bugs.

2175
01:37:06,931 --> 01:37:10,620
Bunny's never threatened by Elmer Fudd.
He's a rabbit and somehow or another

2176
01:37:10,621 --> 01:37:13,290
elmer fudd is so fucking stupid in
elmer.

2177
01:37:13,291 --> 01:37:15,060
Fudd wants to shoot this talk and
rabbit.

2178
01:37:15,061 --> 01:37:18,320
He such an asshole at it.
It's wabbit season

2179
01:37:20,770 --> 01:37:24,060
and he's got a giant head like a baby.
Like what does that,

2180
01:37:25,180 --> 01:37:27,210
why does he have a baby head wait,
homer fund.

2181
01:37:27,211 --> 01:37:29,160
It's an enormous baby head.
I never even noticed that.

2182
01:37:29,161 --> 01:37:31,110
He's like a baby with a gun.
What's the other one?

2183
01:37:31,111 --> 01:37:34,140
That was elmer and then there was
another one that looked exactly like

2184
01:37:34,170 --> 01:37:35,610
elmer,
but it wasn't elmer.

2185
01:37:36,150 --> 01:37:39,330
Elmer and that's right.
There was another one and another guy.

2186
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:41,430
There was another dude who was the other
guy.

2187
01:37:41,431 --> 01:37:43,010
I always thought that was strange.
Like,

2188
01:37:43,050 --> 01:37:44,520
yeah,
there's more than one hunter.

2189
01:37:44,521 --> 01:37:49,470
Right there was was the other guy.
It was like the second Mister Roper

2190
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:54,120
when they changed the Darren on
bewitched.

2191
01:37:54,130 --> 01:37:56,010
Yeah,
they changed the husband.

2192
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:58,240
The husband got crazy and he asked for
money and they're like,

2193
01:37:58,260 --> 01:37:59,071
mm,
Nah,

2194
01:37:59,071 --> 01:38:00,360
bitch.
Okay,

2195
01:38:00,430 --> 01:38:01,181
no,
no,

2196
01:38:01,181 --> 01:38:02,560
no.
We got a new dad.

2197
01:38:03,190 --> 01:38:03,641
He's like,
well,

2198
01:38:03,641 --> 01:38:05,360
I'm the cold star of the show.
No,

2199
01:38:05,361 --> 01:38:05,540
no,
no.

2200
01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:07,620
It's I dream of Jeannie motherfucker.
Nobody cares it.

2201
01:38:07,621 --> 01:38:11,230
Darren is trashed house Sam.
They pulled the fucking court.

2202
01:38:12,010 --> 01:38:14,890
The floor dropped out.
He disappeared.

2203
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:17,070
I don't think there was another hunter.
Yeah,

2204
01:38:17,071 --> 01:38:18,570
there was a,
it was another dude.

2205
01:38:18,571 --> 01:38:20,600
There's another dude,
didn't have another buddy with them.

2206
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:23,610
Might be like one particular cartoon
that maybe his brother showed up for

2207
01:38:23,611 --> 01:38:24,810
something and they went hunting
together.

2208
01:38:28,030 --> 01:38:33,030
Fool's gold in the fake Elmer Bernstein
bears.

2209
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:35,820
I actually,
I saw that a long time ago,

2210
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:37,770
but that wouldn't freak people out.
It's just like,

2211
01:38:37,771 --> 01:38:41,250
it should have been a different name.
You Dummies Zam movie.

2212
01:38:41,251 --> 01:38:43,140
Where was it?
Or Exist?

2213
01:38:43,740 --> 01:38:45,960
Can exist.
What are those called when people like

2214
01:38:45,961 --> 01:38:47,340
collective.
Yeah.

2215
01:38:47,341 --> 01:38:48,041
What is that?
Emory,

2216
01:38:48,041 --> 01:38:50,310
you forget what it's called.
Fake collective memories.

2217
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:53,220
Those are super common electronic
coupling.

2218
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:57,840
Yeah.
Those are super common about the Mandela

2219
01:38:57,841 --> 01:38:59,280
effect.
That's it.

2220
01:38:59,281 --> 01:39:00,750
That's right.
Yeah.

2221
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:02,250
That's simulation

2222
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:03,720
shit.
Yeah.

2223
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:06,090
Um,
so we were talking about this elsa gate

2224
01:39:06,091 --> 01:39:07,320
thing.
Yes.

2225
01:39:07,350 --> 01:39:08,700
This is,
this is weird.

2226
01:39:08,701 --> 01:39:10,800
No,
this is not a conspiracy theory,

2227
01:39:10,801 --> 01:39:12,080
ladies and gentlemen.
So before you go,

2228
01:39:12,081 --> 01:39:13,290
oh,
I can't believe in show.

2229
01:39:13,470 --> 01:39:14,380
Here's the morgue.
So true.

2230
01:39:14,390 --> 01:39:15,780
It's hard to Solon,
listen,

2231
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:21,680
there's something going on where they're
making these youtube clips and they play

2232
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:24,301
like,
you know,

2233
01:39:24,301 --> 01:39:26,310
how have you watch,
if you watch a youtube clip,

2234
01:39:26,311 --> 01:39:30,110
say on the brand new 2019 corvette Zr
one like I'm,

2235
01:39:30,140 --> 01:39:31,860
I'm a car freak.
I love watching those videos.

2236
01:39:31,861 --> 01:39:33,810
Like wow,
look how fast,

2237
01:39:34,050 --> 01:39:35,130
look at it.
Go what a beast.

2238
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:40,290
And if you just let that play ill,
youtube will suggest a nother corvette

2239
01:39:40,291 --> 01:39:45,291
movie or video and play that and maybe a
video on a shootout between a couple of

2240
01:39:45,811 --> 01:39:47,790
different types of cars he would handles
better.

2241
01:39:47,791 --> 01:39:50,520
And then you'll just keep playing like
car videos cause it thinks you're on

2242
01:39:50,521 --> 01:39:51,354
that loop.

2243
01:39:51,390 --> 01:39:54,180
Well somewhere along the line,
if you're on a kid's loop,

2244
01:39:54,330 --> 01:39:57,810
you can get looped into one of these
elsa gate videos.

2245
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:01,050
Now some of them,
like the one brian showing me,

2246
01:40:01,051 --> 01:40:06,051
he's like really shitty CGI second life.
And it's like these cartoon characters

2247
01:40:07,351 --> 01:40:12,351
get together and they become like
sexualized and they drink sometimes and

2248
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:15,930
the babies keep getting their heads
busted open.

2249
01:40:16,170 --> 01:40:20,190
Like the babies fall and the beer bottle
flies through the air and hits the baby

2250
01:40:20,191 --> 01:40:22,650
in the head and cuts the baby's head
open and blood's all over the place and

2251
01:40:22,651 --> 01:40:27,300
that one happens all the time.
It repeats itself over and over and over

2252
01:40:27,301 --> 01:40:29,280
again.
That same scene in a bunch of different

2253
01:40:29,281 --> 01:40:34,281
weird cartoons with like babies and baby
animals and you know there's

2254
01:40:34,321 --> 01:40:36,510
anthropomorphization videos where it's
like,

2255
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:37,440
you know the,
the,

2256
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:41,070
the wolf has a bunch of pigs with them
and shit and the pigs get drunk.

2257
01:40:41,071 --> 01:40:43,530
Like that kind of shit.
But there's like hundreds and hundreds

2258
01:40:43,531 --> 01:40:48,531
of them and youtube is me.
They had to be alerted of this stuff.

2259
01:40:48,990 --> 01:40:51,270
You know,
people were watching them with their kid

2260
01:40:51,510 --> 01:40:54,520
and it would go on auto play and your
one year is all sudden watching a beer

2261
01:40:54,521 --> 01:40:58,990
bottle fly through the hair and head in
a [inaudible] rather and bash a baby on

2262
01:40:58,991 --> 01:41:01,660
the head and causing big Gash.
Have you seen any of those?

2263
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:03,110
Yeah,
I just,

2264
01:41:03,270 --> 01:41:05,220
cause I used to watch the ones that you,
you know,

2265
01:41:05,221 --> 01:41:07,260
the second life ones where it's just
ridiculous.

2266
01:41:07,261 --> 01:41:08,580
Like this stuff is crazy.

2267
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:10,250
It's weird.
I didn't even know about this.

2268
01:41:10,251 --> 01:41:14,210
They dress up in these cartoons.
They have little babies that are dressed

2269
01:41:14,211 --> 01:41:17,510
up like spiderman or like Elsa and like
this.

2270
01:41:17,511 --> 01:41:20,450
This scene keeps happening over and over
again where they have beer,

2271
01:41:20,660 --> 01:41:24,170
they get fucked up and then as the baby
falls,

2272
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:27,980
the beer bottle bounces off his head and
shatters and lands on the ground and the

2273
01:41:27,981 --> 01:41:31,370
baby's bleeding.
It happens over and over again and so in

2274
01:41:31,371 --> 01:41:33,410
this one with the minions,
a little baby minions,

2275
01:41:33,411 --> 01:41:35,420
they fall,
Bam gets caught in the head.

2276
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:37,820
It's the same scene.
Here's the Mickey Mouse.

2277
01:41:37,821 --> 01:41:41,150
One little babies get fucked up.
They fall.

2278
01:41:41,690 --> 01:41:44,990
Beer bottle hits the baby in the head is
another one with a little foxes.

2279
01:41:45,350 --> 01:41:47,660
They get fucked up.
Beer bottle hits the kid in the head.

2280
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:50,210
It's always the same shit.
It's stupid.

2281
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:51,890
It's not stupid.
It's weird.

2282
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:56,080
It's weird because it's not.
It's not just things happen and it's,

2283
01:41:56,100 --> 01:42:00,050
it's the same violent scene over and
over again and the babies are the ones

2284
01:42:00,051 --> 01:42:02,240
that are getting brutalized in these.
They're getting hit in the head with

2285
01:42:02,241 --> 01:42:03,830
beer bottles,
giant Gash.

2286
01:42:03,831 --> 01:42:06,020
His blood.
Like what is that?

2287
01:42:06,740 --> 01:42:07,730
Yeah,
it's almost like that.

2288
01:42:07,731 --> 01:42:08,564
What's that?
Yeah,

2289
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:12,800
the youtube crap or that you used to be
really popular where they would just

2290
01:42:12,801 --> 01:42:15,580
edit things together real fast and an
end with like ha,

2291
01:42:15,620 --> 01:42:18,560
like screaming.
And what was that shit called?

2292
01:42:18,730 --> 01:42:20,920
That was user created.
There was a bunch of people like you

2293
01:42:20,921 --> 01:42:24,040
could see those people doing them.
They just decided to try to talk real

2294
01:42:24,041 --> 01:42:27,850
fast and cut out all the breaths in
between it and slam it together.

2295
01:42:27,851 --> 01:42:29,350
Look,
you have no intention span whatsoever.

2296
01:42:30,020 --> 01:42:33,050
Now this stuff like in what we're
watching now I find,

2297
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:35,960
I feel like they're all,
they're all using the same characters.

2298
01:42:35,961 --> 01:42:37,940
Right?
So it seems like to me it's from a

2299
01:42:37,941 --> 01:42:40,850
message board.
It's like when we were back in the day

2300
01:42:40,851 --> 01:42:43,970
on your message board and we would like
make all these videos and stuff like

2301
01:42:43,971 --> 01:42:45,500
that.
It seems like it's from a group of

2302
01:42:45,501 --> 01:42:47,660
people that all are doing it.
You know,

2303
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:52,430
collectively like to me it seems like,
like you'll find like a deep four chan

2304
01:42:52,431 --> 01:42:56,180
thread in it or something where like,
Oh I did the baby falling video or

2305
01:42:56,181 --> 01:42:56,580
something.

2306
01:42:56,580 --> 01:42:58,500
No,
there's a bunch of different ones man.

2307
01:42:58,501 --> 01:43:01,950
I mean there's,
there's this was like with real people

2308
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:04,290
but the ones that you're talking about
with the,

2309
01:43:04,291 --> 01:43:06,390
uh,
the cartoon ones,

2310
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:09,570
they're being made in other countries.
They're not speaking English in any of

2311
01:43:09,571 --> 01:43:11,810
them.
It's all like noises and stuff and

2312
01:43:12,350 --> 01:43:16,410
they're generating like if their ad
friendly and some of them were approved

2313
01:43:16,411 --> 01:43:18,330
for ads,
they're generating a tremendous amount

2314
01:43:18,331 --> 01:43:20,160
of money.
You got to think about how many hits

2315
01:43:20,161 --> 01:43:23,250
these fucking things are getting and how
many like see if you could pull up one

2316
01:43:23,251 --> 01:43:25,470
and see how many millions of hits it
had.

2317
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:26,310
Got It.
Yeah.

2318
01:43:26,310 --> 01:43:27,540
I just pulled up,
had 5 million,

2319
01:43:27,750 --> 01:43:29,250
5 million.
Okay,

2320
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:31,830
so 5 million hits is the business.
All right?

2321
01:43:31,831 --> 01:43:33,960
If you've got ads on a video for little
kids,

2322
01:43:33,961 --> 01:43:35,550
that gets 5 million hits,
that's a business.

2323
01:43:35,551 --> 01:43:37,050
Now,
if you've got those things in there,

2324
01:43:37,051 --> 01:43:38,490
generating them by computers.

2325
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:41,460
So you're making hundreds and hundreds
of them and you put them all over the

2326
01:43:41,461 --> 01:43:43,920
Internet and they all have 5 million
hits each.

2327
01:43:44,220 --> 01:43:47,100
You're talking about a substantial
amount of money that you're getting

2328
01:43:47,101 --> 01:43:50,070
every month and they're just making
these things.

2329
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:53,720
And then the real fucked up thing.
It's like apparently there's some,

2330
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:56,220
again,
I just read the beginning of this and

2331
01:43:56,220 --> 01:43:58,250
then never read any further into it but
read it.

2332
01:43:58,610 --> 01:44:00,980
Ah,
how to thread apparently where these

2333
01:44:00,981 --> 01:44:04,640
people were trying to decipher some of
the things that are being said in the

2334
01:44:04,641 --> 01:44:09,641
comments and they think that they're
using the comments as like ways we're

2335
01:44:09,951 --> 01:44:12,440
child trafficking.
People can communicate with Jonah.

2336
01:44:12,890 --> 01:44:15,980
This is like speculation,
which sounds like wow,

2337
01:44:15,981 --> 01:44:18,830
that seems far fetched.
But so it doesn't child trafficking

2338
01:44:18,831 --> 01:44:20,450
sound far fetched.
I mean,

2339
01:44:20,451 --> 01:44:21,680
you know it's real.
All right.

2340
01:44:21,681 --> 01:44:23,850
Child trafficking sounds crazy
farfetched.

2341
01:44:23,890 --> 01:44:27,080
Like the idea that someone's so evil
that they're selling children,

2342
01:44:27,140 --> 01:44:27,890
right?
It doesn't,

2343
01:44:27,890 --> 01:44:29,360
it doesn't it?
Yeah.

2344
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:33,110
So if that is,
then why wouldn't it be that they would

2345
01:44:33,111 --> 01:44:33,944
communicate?
I mean,

2346
01:44:33,950 --> 01:44:37,790
is it more far fetched that they
communicate in code in some sort of way

2347
01:44:37,791 --> 01:44:38,624
in the comments?

2348
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:40,500
Yeah,
because they probably wouldn't do it on

2349
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:42,270
kid videos.
Would probably do it online.

2350
01:44:42,271 --> 01:44:44,310
Like just like any video,
like tractor.

2351
01:44:44,590 --> 01:44:46,760
It could be videos or something.
I think.

2352
01:44:46,910 --> 01:44:47,601
Yeah,
it could be.

2353
01:44:47,601 --> 01:44:49,730
Maybe they're not that smart.
That's where the trauma Lester's right.

2354
01:44:49,731 --> 01:44:50,750
But,
but also that,

2355
01:44:50,780 --> 01:44:53,370
um,
like these why else?

2356
01:44:53,510 --> 01:44:55,490
These kids are not going to make
comments.

2357
01:44:55,640 --> 01:44:57,530
So who's making comments on these
videos?

2358
01:44:58,440 --> 01:44:59,560
It to me,
again,

2359
01:44:59,590 --> 01:45:02,620
it seems like it's a,
it's a group of people somewhere and

2360
01:45:02,621 --> 01:45:06,160
it's making these now the fact that that
youtube is letting them sell it as kids,

2361
01:45:06,220 --> 01:45:09,010
they need to change.
Youtube needs to change how they have

2362
01:45:09,011 --> 01:45:12,070
kid videos.
Cat Videos should have a team of people.

2363
01:45:12,190 --> 01:45:15,130
You get approved then you become in for
sure two kids.

2364
01:45:15,250 --> 01:45:17,830
That's it.
You can't just upload anything and put

2365
01:45:17,890 --> 01:45:21,530
the kid to tag on it.
You should have the kid tag.

2366
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:22,780
Yeah.
How kids find out about it.

2367
01:45:22,860 --> 01:45:25,570
Yeah.
You give your kid the user response when

2368
01:45:25,571 --> 01:45:29,080
you get your kid like the ipad and he
put it on Youtube.

2369
01:45:29,081 --> 01:45:31,990
Kids that should be selected videos
only.

2370
01:45:32,020 --> 01:45:34,660
It's been approved by eyeballs and so
on.

2371
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:37,120
I should not be able to make a kid
video,

2372
01:45:37,150 --> 01:45:38,170
you know?
That's true.

2373
01:45:38,410 --> 01:45:41,200
Definitely not be able to make kid video
where a kid gets hit in the head with a

2374
01:45:41,201 --> 01:45:41,630
fucking

2375
01:45:41,630 --> 01:45:45,740
bottle right now.
If that shit was like just on like once

2376
01:45:45,741 --> 01:45:47,390
someone,
one of us did it and were like,

2377
01:45:47,391 --> 01:45:50,480
I just made all these stupid videos of
kids falling down on the ground and it

2378
01:45:50,481 --> 01:45:51,800
wasn't for kids.
And then you'd be like,

2379
01:45:51,801 --> 01:45:54,860
that's just a stupid cartoon that you
would see on like adult swim or

2380
01:45:54,861 --> 01:45:56,510
something like that.
Four in the morning,

2381
01:45:56,680 --> 01:45:58,760
right in there.
You could see something like that on

2382
01:45:58,761 --> 01:45:59,900
adult swim at four o'clock in the
morning,

2383
01:46:00,690 --> 01:46:04,230
especially the ones that I watched,
those stupid ones

2384
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:06,760
that could actually be like some sort of
a,

2385
01:46:06,770 --> 01:46:09,140
an like some thing that,
what's that called?

2386
01:46:09,350 --> 01:46:13,310
What's interspliced inside of a show
where like a non sequitur video comes

2387
01:46:13,311 --> 01:46:14,690
in.
And what's that called?

2388
01:46:15,540 --> 01:46:18,230
Uh,
it's like an adult swim cartoon where

2389
01:46:18,231 --> 01:46:20,620
you're like,
what the commercial work commercial out

2390
01:46:20,621 --> 01:46:21,710
of nowhere that's just

2391
01:46:22,470 --> 01:46:26,180
get stuck in there where the Mickey
Mouse Daddy is drinking with the babies.

2392
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:27,900
The babies fall and gets hit in the head
with a bottle.

2393
01:46:27,901 --> 01:46:31,080
Like what the fuck?
And then you cut to some wolf that's

2394
01:46:31,081 --> 01:46:34,380
telling you about the past of robot
chicken a lot just to real quick 15

2395
01:46:34,410 --> 01:46:35,340
second thing and be like,
what?

2396
01:46:35,341 --> 01:46:37,950
What's that?
What does the word interstition what

2397
01:46:37,951 --> 01:46:39,010
does that word?
I don't know.

2398
01:46:39,011 --> 01:46:40,860
There's,
I know you're talking about it's blank

2399
01:46:40,861 --> 01:46:42,570
interstitial,
cause that is,

2400
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:45,151
uh,
that was,

2401
01:46:45,151 --> 01:46:48,610
matthew mcconaughey was in that too,
but he was in this movie.

2402
01:46:48,750 --> 01:46:49,583
He was the

2403
01:46:50,370 --> 01:46:51,950
dark tower movie.
Oh really?

2404
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:52,681
It was.
Yeah,

2405
01:46:52,681 --> 01:46:53,700
he was,
he's the bad guy.

2406
01:46:53,850 --> 01:46:57,090
Matthew mcconaughey's bad guy.
And all I could think of that was all I

2407
01:46:57,091 --> 01:46:58,970
could think of was,
um,

2408
01:46:59,810 --> 01:47:03,420
Louis C K is bit about Mad Mike and,
uh,

2409
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:05,400
Louis C.
Case bit about Matthew mcconaughey.

2410
01:47:05,401 --> 01:47:07,620
Do you remember it?
And he's like,

2411
01:47:07,710 --> 01:47:11,540
the law says you can't touch,
but I see a lot of law

2412
01:47:11,620 --> 01:47:15,340
burgers out here
has lilly does

2413
01:47:15,610 --> 01:47:17,410
brigette he talks about how he,
he was,

2414
01:47:17,470 --> 01:47:20,230
he loved the movie so much.
They was walking around his house saying

2415
01:47:20,231 --> 01:47:23,880
that thing over and over and over again.
So when I was watching this movie,

2416
01:47:23,910 --> 01:47:28,180
Matthew mcconaughey is the bad guy.
All I could think of is Louis C K is bit

2417
01:47:28,210 --> 01:47:30,010
going on things.
A lot of law burgers out here.

2418
01:47:30,570 --> 01:47:32,620
Match of a guy.
It's a stripper.

2419
01:47:36,870 --> 01:47:39,330
That's all I could think of.
That fucking happens,

2420
01:47:39,331 --> 01:47:40,320
man.
That happens.

2421
01:47:40,321 --> 01:47:42,930
Where a good comic.
We'll do a bit about something like

2422
01:47:42,931 --> 01:47:43,351
that.
Oh,

2423
01:47:43,351 --> 01:47:46,740
that subjects ruined.
He's got me every time I see Matthew

2424
01:47:46,741 --> 01:47:48,740
mcconaughey,
I think it was a thing is a lot of long

2425
01:47:48,830 --> 01:47:49,663
burgers.

2426
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:57,970
Hbo Pulled All the Louis C K Shit
offline tid.

2427
01:47:57,980 --> 01:47:58,990
They really?
Yeah.

2428
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:01,920
Okay.
That's a hard one.

2429
01:48:02,210 --> 01:48:05,420
That seems silly and it's still funny
comedy.

2430
01:48:05,421 --> 01:48:08,090
He wasn't jerking off in front of
anybody when he did the comedy.

2431
01:48:08,650 --> 01:48:11,960
Like just like you can't invalidate
everything everybody's ever done.

2432
01:48:11,961 --> 01:48:14,600
If they did something bad,
it's not good that he did it,

2433
01:48:14,780 --> 01:48:18,710
but it's kind of fucked up that day.
Did that even though he,

2434
01:48:19,010 --> 01:48:22,010
you know,
the situation of him asking permission

2435
01:48:22,011 --> 01:48:24,680
and him admitting it and coming out and
apologizing,

2436
01:48:24,890 --> 01:48:25,940
but yet didn't,
there's that,

2437
01:48:25,941 --> 01:48:29,840
that masterson scientologists guide that
all his shows are on there and then

2438
01:48:29,841 --> 01:48:31,220
there's like real,
the more people.

2439
01:48:31,250 --> 01:48:33,200
Do you think that those are real,
those stories are real?

2440
01:48:33,470 --> 01:48:35,240
I think a lot of them are real.
Yeah,

2441
01:48:35,510 --> 01:48:37,520
I really do.
I mean like why haven't they done

2442
01:48:37,521 --> 01:48:39,050
something?
If that story is real,

2443
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:41,480
it seems like that one would be
something that would get a lot of

2444
01:48:41,481 --> 01:48:42,314
attention

2445
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:46,980
hold.
It happened

2446
01:48:46,980 --> 01:48:47,910
yesterday and,
uh,

2447
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:50,790
the,
I guess sports world and the Ohio state

2448
01:48:50,791 --> 01:48:53,400
world to the,
so the defensive coordinator who used to

2449
01:48:53,401 --> 01:48:57,600
be an nfl coach was rumored earlier
yesterday afternoon or I think maybe

2450
01:48:57,601 --> 01:48:59,730
even Saturday,
that he was going to be hired as the new

2451
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:01,470
head coach for Tennessee's football
team.

2452
01:49:02,190 --> 01:49:04,110
Um,
they were going to make the announcement

2453
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:08,400
yesterday evening I believe,
but at some point after the agreement

2454
01:49:08,401 --> 01:49:09,810
had been signed,
um,

2455
01:49:10,110 --> 01:49:13,710
it hit the media in Tennessee and there
was protests in front of the stadium.

2456
01:49:13,950 --> 01:49:16,410
All of their fans and alumni were pissed
at this is going to happen.

2457
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:20,730
Someone out of that,
he was on the Penn state team,

2458
01:49:20,731 --> 01:49:22,890
he was one of the assistants to Jerry
Sandusky.

2459
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:25,360
Ooh.
So the uh,

2460
01:49:26,250 --> 01:49:28,650
tying to that,
although he's already been vetted by

2461
01:49:28,651 --> 01:49:30,480
Ohio state,
like he's already the coach there and

2462
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:34,020
Urban Meyer's team has vetted them and
backed him and all that.

2463
01:49:34,950 --> 01:49:39,720
So before the night was over,
they already canceled a contract and now

2464
01:49:39,721 --> 01:49:42,540
he's,
I think even going to sue them for money

2465
01:49:42,541 --> 01:49:44,520
that he was supposedly going to be owed,
cause he probably,

2466
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:46,830
he could have already got rid of his
house like in that day because he was

2467
01:49:46,831 --> 01:49:47,531
going to leave,
you know,

2468
01:49:47,531 --> 01:49:49,690
so all sorts of things happened and
just,

2469
01:49:50,140 --> 01:49:52,520
it was like literally 24 hours or less
that close to,

2470
01:49:52,521 --> 01:49:54,280
he worked at Jerry Sandusky,
I don't know,

2471
01:49:54,281 --> 01:49:56,530
cause he was an assistant.
He was younger.

2472
01:49:56,531 --> 01:49:58,180
There's other,
there's a couple of other coaches on

2473
01:49:58,181 --> 01:50:00,190
there that claim to not know anything
too.

2474
01:50:00,191 --> 01:50:03,840
I believe man and sort of some other
people like Kirk Carpentry.

2475
01:50:03,850 --> 01:50:05,710
I started tweeting out last night that
this was a,

2476
01:50:06,180 --> 01:50:07,060
um,
like,

2477
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:09,400
do you really think that you should do
this with no evidence?

2478
01:50:09,401 --> 01:50:11,230
There is no evidence in this case
apparently,

2479
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:15,070
and he's lost.
He doesn't have that job opportunity now

2480
01:50:15,071 --> 01:50:15,560
I guess.

2481
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:20,000
I think you need a real investigation
before you commit to something like

2482
01:50:20,001 --> 01:50:20,930
that.
And He,

2483
01:50:21,110 --> 01:50:23,360
I mean,
I don't know the case.

2484
01:50:24,060 --> 01:50:26,990
He might have not known.
It's possible that he didn't know.

2485
01:50:27,890 --> 01:50:29,720
But if you didn't know,
like don't you think there'd be like a

2486
01:50:29,721 --> 01:50:34,721
story you'd hear something melt down
over potential hiring of Greg Ciano is a

2487
01:50:35,481 --> 01:50:37,880
bad look for Tennessee program.
Hmm?

2488
01:50:38,840 --> 01:50:40,360
What's a bad look?
Hmm.

2489
01:50:41,310 --> 01:50:43,880
I don't know what it see.
I don't know what the fuck is going on.

2490
01:50:43,910 --> 01:50:47,330
If you knew that this guy knew,
then you would have this feeling like,

2491
01:50:47,331 --> 01:50:48,320
hey,
fuck that guy.

2492
01:50:48,950 --> 01:50:51,560
But if you,
if you knew that he didn't know,

2493
01:50:51,561 --> 01:50:52,760
you'd be furious.
He'd be like,

2494
01:50:52,761 --> 01:50:53,090
no,
you're,

2495
01:50:53,090 --> 01:50:57,080
you're labeling an innocent man and
saying he's a bad person.

2496
01:50:57,081 --> 01:50:58,610
Like there's needs to be an
investigation.

2497
01:50:58,910 --> 01:51:01,490
If there has been an investigation,
you've got to accept the results.

2498
01:51:01,491 --> 01:51:04,640
Otherwise you're on a witch hunt.
You got to figure out what's really

2499
01:51:04,641 --> 01:51:06,050
happened.
I don't know.

2500
01:51:06,140 --> 01:51:07,370
See,
I don't know the particulars,

2501
01:51:07,730 --> 01:51:10,370
but if you know the particulars,
you know,

2502
01:51:10,371 --> 01:51:11,410
and you,
you're,

2503
01:51:11,780 --> 01:51:13,010
you got to make a case for it.

2504
01:51:13,930 --> 01:51:15,310
It's like,
look at Al Franklin.

2505
01:51:15,390 --> 01:51:18,190
I like it like that.
That let a little vague picture of him

2506
01:51:18,300 --> 01:51:21,000
like acting like he's grabbing that
girl's boobs and then you see the,

2507
01:51:21,010 --> 01:51:23,890
all the stuff that comes out about her
after where it's like,

2508
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:24,480
oh,
she,

2509
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:27,460
she was like groping all these people
the whole time.

2510
01:51:27,461 --> 01:51:28,410
You know,
Leanne tweeting.

2511
01:51:28,420 --> 01:51:29,010
No.
Yeah.

2512
01:51:29,010 --> 01:51:30,820
If there was a been fake

2513
01:51:31,650 --> 01:51:32,840
dude,
I didn't see any of that.

2514
01:51:32,841 --> 01:51:35,180
There's video of apologized for what he
did though.

2515
01:51:35,690 --> 01:51:36,261
Like,
I mean,

2516
01:51:36,261 --> 01:51:37,550
what he was doing was trying to be
funny,

2517
01:51:37,610 --> 01:51:39,790
trying to be funny,
taking a picture and he wasn't even a,

2518
01:51:40,220 --> 01:51:44,330
he was a comedian bank then.
He wasn't even a state representative.

2519
01:51:44,331 --> 01:51:46,160
But either way,
it's like you don't do that.

2520
01:51:46,161 --> 01:51:48,230
That could be your mom,
that could be your sister.

2521
01:51:48,260 --> 01:51:50,360
She's out cold.
It's not like it's your girlfriend.

2522
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:52,520
You joke around.
It's one thing that was your girlfriend.

2523
01:51:52,521 --> 01:51:54,110
If you girlfriends out and you take a
picture like,

2524
01:51:54,610 --> 01:51:55,970
and you'd be silly,
right?

2525
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:58,400
She loves you.
That's your girlfriend.

2526
01:51:58,430 --> 01:52:01,100
She knows the joke.
It's like I've heard she takes a picture

2527
01:52:01,250 --> 01:52:02,990
like sit next to your Dick while you
were unconscious.

2528
01:52:02,991 --> 01:52:05,000
She goes like this one,
I wouldn't be upset.

2529
01:52:05,180 --> 01:52:06,013
Right,
right.

2530
01:52:06,350 --> 01:52:09,410
Um,
but she wasn't his girlfriend.

2531
01:52:10,220 --> 01:52:12,160
She was working,
he was working,

2532
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:15,680
they're always doing this charity tour.
And she said that he tried to kiss her.

2533
01:52:16,070 --> 01:52:17,510
There was like,
it was more than one thing.

2534
01:52:18,170 --> 01:52:21,770
So he apologized for that.
And then there was the other women that

2535
01:52:21,771 --> 01:52:22,880
were saying that he grabbed her butt.

2536
01:52:24,260 --> 01:52:27,090
Well it's that dance do that.
He said that was just like,

2537
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:29,100
you know when you're taking photos.
And he said,

2538
01:52:29,101 --> 01:52:30,850
the one girl said like,
he put his hand on my bike.

2539
01:52:31,140 --> 01:52:32,490
I mean,
when you're taking a photo,

2540
01:52:32,491 --> 01:52:34,920
you just put your arm around somebody.
Maybe a touches your,

2541
01:52:34,921 --> 01:52:36,850
but I be,
I be old

2542
01:52:36,850 --> 01:52:39,610
dudes like to grab butts too though.
It's an old dude thing.

2543
01:52:39,611 --> 01:52:40,550
George Bush.
George Bush,

2544
01:52:41,620 --> 01:52:43,520
George W.
Bush likes to take pictures of people

2545
01:52:43,521 --> 01:52:44,920
and a ride as they go to take the
picture.

2546
01:52:44,921 --> 01:52:45,800
He squeezes their ass,

2547
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:48,200
but that might be like some old Texas
man.

2548
01:52:48,310 --> 01:52:50,470
Thanks.
Hey joke.

2549
01:52:51,020 --> 01:52:53,180
Plus he's almost dead.
Leave him alone.

2550
01:52:53,240 --> 01:52:56,360
Like people have to realize he's the
longest living president ever

2551
01:52:56,440 --> 01:52:57,280
at this point.
Yeah,

2552
01:52:57,670 --> 01:52:59,350
he's the oldest one.
Yeah.

2553
01:53:00,340 --> 01:53:01,930
Jimmy Carter Carter still

2554
01:53:02,470 --> 01:53:05,950
now he's not his old Herbert Walker.
Bush is older than Carter.

2555
01:53:06,470 --> 01:53:10,510
I think you right now he's the oldest
surviving president is what they say.

2556
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:14,410
But Carter is the longest,
longest to go that he was president.

2557
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:16,181
Yeah,
man.

2558
01:53:16,181 --> 01:53:18,400
He's almost dead like he's got to grab
acids.

2559
01:53:18,401 --> 01:53:22,310
He's going for it.
That's what's also ridiculous looking.

2560
01:53:22,330 --> 01:53:24,610
If you,
if you became like like a president or

2561
01:53:24,611 --> 01:53:27,400
something like that and then you went
through all the photos you've ever taken

2562
01:53:27,401 --> 01:53:30,580
with fans after a show or at shows and
stuff like that.

2563
01:53:30,700 --> 01:53:32,120
You can take any of those photos.
My,

2564
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:32,741
Oh my God,
look,

2565
01:53:32,741 --> 01:53:37,060
he's making a blowjob face to a woman
under the age of 17 or so.

2566
01:53:37,930 --> 01:53:41,320
If you freeze every people take so many
pictures.

2567
01:53:41,650 --> 01:53:43,700
We're taking pictures when you're not
looking at your mouth is open.

2568
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:46,670
Yeah,
but it's like,

2569
01:53:47,270 --> 01:53:50,900
I think that those old dudes just
grabbed acids.

2570
01:53:51,140 --> 01:53:52,490
I think that's what's coming out.

2571
01:53:53,220 --> 01:53:55,740
They just thought it was a thing.
They get away with it.

2572
01:53:55,741 --> 01:53:57,420
They grabbed acids when they took
pictures.

2573
01:53:58,310 --> 01:54:01,260
They probably grab yours do just to get
to look in your face like,

2574
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:02,131
oh,
totally.

2575
01:54:02,131 --> 01:54:03,360
There's probably a joke.
Sports.

2576
01:54:03,361 --> 01:54:05,250
I don't think anyone really slaps butts
anymore.

2577
01:54:05,251 --> 01:54:07,830
It used to be a thing all the time or
they certainly,

2578
01:54:07,831 --> 01:54:09,900
they slapped butts.
There was a video that Morgan Murphy

2579
01:54:09,901 --> 01:54:13,440
posted and it looks like a,
I think it's on her instagram and it

2580
01:54:13,441 --> 01:54:16,800
looks like some dude comes from behind
or refereeing smacks his buddy in the

2581
01:54:16,801 --> 01:54:19,170
ass and the guy like goes,
yeah,

2582
01:54:19,790 --> 01:54:21,960
see if you can find it.
It's on Morgan Murphys.

2583
01:54:21,961 --> 01:54:26,580
Instagram from I think yesterday.
I think soccer player is constantly do

2584
01:54:26,581 --> 01:54:28,650
crazy shit,
like grabbing each other's dicks and

2585
01:54:28,651 --> 01:54:29,720
shit.
Oh Damn.

2586
01:54:29,740 --> 01:54:32,190
It happens in football,
but that's like in a scrum than not like

2587
01:54:32,191 --> 01:54:33,590
a friendly,
right.

2588
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:34,180
Right,
right.

2589
01:54:34,180 --> 01:54:37,530
But this is two referees.
This video is a referee doing it to

2590
01:54:37,531 --> 01:54:38,364
another referee.

2591
01:54:38,710 --> 01:54:41,300
It's hot.
This is here,

2592
01:54:41,301 --> 01:54:42,860
it wants this.
So this guy,

2593
01:54:42,870 --> 01:54:47,470
he's my off times man.
They talked to each other and watched.

2594
01:54:47,471 --> 01:54:50,210
The guy comes by and Oh,
the flag in the face.

2595
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:53,150
Oh,
he took a fine his butt pinched.

2596
01:54:54,050 --> 01:54:54,960
I know.
Yeah.

2597
01:54:55,870 --> 01:54:57,500
That's another thing.
Barely pay attention.

2598
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:00,940
Parents.
That's me hoping that it was a buck and

2599
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:05,200
that's why I freaked out.
That's how I look at things.

2600
01:55:05,410 --> 01:55:08,200
I'm like,
just show me any reason why this is more

2601
01:55:08,201 --> 01:55:09,040
exciting than it really is.

2602
01:55:09,420 --> 01:55:11,900
Wow.
Or just seeing a guy get hit in the face

2603
01:55:11,901 --> 01:55:13,100
of the flag.
My brain was like,

2604
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:16,250
not good enough.
Not good enough.

2605
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:19,940
I've been drunk for five days.
Oh yeah.

2606
01:55:20,070 --> 01:55:23,950
I did vacation and uh,
just got hammered every night.

2607
01:55:23,951 --> 01:55:24,950
It was wonderful.
Wine.

2608
01:55:24,951 --> 01:55:26,260
Drunk wine.
Yeah.

2609
01:55:26,340 --> 01:55:29,330
Wine bonk wine just puts you out,
man.

2610
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:31,760
Like,
I don't know how the fuck the barbarians

2611
01:55:31,761 --> 01:55:34,850
invaded countries on wine.
Just seems like they would have no

2612
01:55:34,851 --> 01:55:37,220
ambition.
Like wine just makes you so tired.

2613
01:55:37,340 --> 01:55:39,680
We're lucky they didn't know about like
whiskey,

2614
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:42,140
Magid.
The barbarians had whiskey instead of

2615
01:55:42,141 --> 01:55:45,000
wine.
Been way bloodier

2616
01:55:46,750 --> 01:55:48,550
I can't,
I haven't done one in awhile.

2617
01:55:48,610 --> 01:55:52,500
It gives you a puts out bad morning I
think I,

2618
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:53,380
yeah,
there's something

2619
01:55:53,380 --> 01:55:56,210
then going on right where you get like a
weird headache sometimes.

2620
01:55:56,870 --> 01:56:00,500
I've talked to people about that.
I never got a satisfactory explanation

2621
01:56:00,501 --> 01:56:02,450
that I wind up.
Are Men remembering.

2622
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:03,620
Yeah,
I bet that's it.

2623
01:56:03,860 --> 01:56:08,690
I bet it's like eating a lot of cake.
You eat a lot of cake,

2624
01:56:08,691 --> 01:56:10,580
Ben.
You get that fucking feeling the next

2625
01:56:10,580 --> 01:56:12,170
day.
Like what did I do?

2626
01:56:13,340 --> 01:56:15,590
I didn't watch anything at eight all
week eight,

2627
01:56:15,591 --> 01:56:18,560
whatever the fuck I wanted to eat.
That's my go to vacation move now.

2628
01:56:18,740 --> 01:56:19,640
Yeah.
Yeah.

2629
01:56:19,641 --> 01:56:23,300
Cause then you come back,
you feel so bad that you want to like

2630
01:56:23,301 --> 01:56:27,200
get back on a diet.
It'd be like real cautious and that's

2631
01:56:27,201 --> 01:56:28,460
why I'm going to do this.
No wheat,

2632
01:56:29,210 --> 01:56:30,620
nope.
No Pasta,

2633
01:56:30,680 --> 01:56:33,860
no sugar workout.
Five days a week.

2634
01:56:33,950 --> 01:56:35,540
Two drinks a week.
That's it.

2635
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:38,490
I've been trying to eat steak a lot.
Just just steak,

2636
01:56:38,790 --> 01:56:41,100
like steak kabobs.
Those aren't my thing.

2637
01:56:41,550 --> 01:56:43,950
Dude watches wheat documentary,
you'll throw a pizza away forever.

2638
01:56:44,790 --> 01:56:46,380
No more sandwiches.
Pizza,

2639
01:56:46,410 --> 01:56:48,690
no more burgers.
I can't wait for the meet doctor to come

2640
01:56:48,691 --> 01:56:49,440
on soon.
Right?

2641
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:50,270
Yeah.
Yeah,

2642
01:56:50,270 --> 01:56:51,750
the meat down there.
Better way to describe it.

2643
01:56:51,751 --> 01:56:52,890
But yeah,
the carnivore,

2644
01:56:52,891 --> 01:56:54,000
he's a full carnivore.

2645
01:56:54,190 --> 01:56:58,150
That's all he does is eat meat.
He thinks he's been like this crazy

2646
01:56:58,151 --> 01:57:00,280
proponent of meat eating only

2647
01:57:00,950 --> 01:57:03,200
the has to be badgered.
Stanker you're something,

2648
01:57:03,201 --> 01:57:05,130
right?
Cholesterol or a site owner.

2649
01:57:05,330 --> 01:57:06,230
It seems like it would be

2650
01:57:07,820 --> 01:57:09,530
perfectly healthy though.
I just,

2651
01:57:09,570 --> 01:57:10,940
I dunno.
I mean,

2652
01:57:10,941 --> 01:57:14,570
I think one thing is like,
I would think you would need some

2653
01:57:14,571 --> 01:57:16,790
nutrients from vegetables,
right?

2654
01:57:16,820 --> 01:57:18,980
And then there's some things you can
only get from vegetables.

2655
01:57:19,610 --> 01:57:21,500
But then are you getting any of that
from me?

2656
01:57:21,501 --> 01:57:23,780
Because they eat vegetables.
Like that's the idea.

2657
01:57:23,781 --> 01:57:26,600
It's like lions don't really eat a lot
of salads.

2658
01:57:26,810 --> 01:57:30,350
They just fuck up zebras
and zebras.

2659
01:57:30,530 --> 01:57:33,770
They do plenty of salad eat and for the
lion and the lines are good.

2660
01:57:34,010 --> 01:57:35,300
You know,
they don't really have to,

2661
01:57:35,301 --> 01:57:36,380
uh,
eat it on their own.

2662
01:57:36,660 --> 01:57:40,840
If that blueberry affects the bear meat
so much that it changes the shape and

2663
01:57:40,841 --> 01:57:43,300
color and taste of it,
then it not all that shape.

2664
01:57:43,301 --> 01:57:45,640
I didn't mean that but like that
definitely,

2665
01:57:45,790 --> 01:57:46,120
yeah.

2666
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:47,770
Changes the color and the taste of the
meat.

2667
01:57:48,790 --> 01:57:52,150
It would only make sense that you're
getting something from the grass when

2668
01:57:52,151 --> 01:57:55,390
you eat a steak,
which is why grass fed steak is better

2669
01:57:55,420 --> 01:57:57,520
for you,
like proven for you.

2670
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:00,100
Then corn fed steak because corn is
basically sugar.

2671
01:58:00,620 --> 01:58:04,120
I mean well it's not good when you shit
and you see,

2672
01:58:04,510 --> 01:58:05,710
hey that's not even digest

2673
01:58:05,710 --> 01:58:10,440
it like the reason why he's he corn in
your shit cause that your body's like,

2674
01:58:10,441 --> 01:58:13,740
what am I doing with this?
This guy's eating plastic.

2675
01:58:13,741 --> 01:58:16,440
Just spit this out.
That's such a weird thing.

2676
01:58:16,441 --> 01:58:18,060
You're assholes.
Just like get it out,

2677
01:58:18,090 --> 01:58:20,070
get it out.
When I'm going to try to process it.

2678
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:23,160
We're not going to break it down.
Did I tell you a long time ago,

2679
01:58:23,220 --> 01:58:26,010
I think I already told you this,
but back in the day when like hands

2680
01:58:26,011 --> 01:58:29,040
across America and all that shit we were
supposed to write in school,

2681
01:58:29,130 --> 01:58:31,350
like how do we help starvation and stuff
like that.

2682
01:58:31,351 --> 01:58:33,820
If we have any ideas.
And I wrote about how we should just

2683
01:58:33,860 --> 01:58:36,930
feed everyone in corn and then they
could wash it off the next day and eat

2684
01:58:36,931 --> 01:58:39,480
it like a few more times.
And I got in trouble for that.

2685
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:42,130
Like mom had like,
brain's always been

2686
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:46,050
gross.
My Mom's like had to get caught in and

2687
01:58:46,060 --> 01:58:48,610
it's stuff like that because of that.
And I was thinking like,

2688
01:58:48,611 --> 01:58:51,850
well you can eat it twice.
Like that's like make sense to me.

2689
01:58:51,851 --> 01:58:55,060
Like it's untouched.
Did you know that some native Americans

2690
01:58:55,061 --> 01:58:57,680
used to call it a second harvest and
needs to eat thrown shit.

2691
01:58:57,720 --> 01:58:58,610
Really?
Yeah,

2692
01:58:59,510 --> 01:59:00,480
yeah,
yeah.

2693
01:59:00,490 --> 01:59:02,410
I read that somewhere.
I think the cooked it or something.

2694
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:04,600
They call it second harvest.
I mean,

2695
01:59:04,601 --> 01:59:06,910
you gotta be hungry as fuck.
Oh,

2696
01:59:06,911 --> 01:59:08,080
by the way,
the person told me,

2697
01:59:08,081 --> 01:59:11,200
this might've been crazy,
might've made this up.

2698
01:59:11,220 --> 01:59:12,460
I,
I'll remember who it was.

2699
01:59:12,461 --> 01:59:13,420
I'm trying to remember.
Oh,

2700
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:15,760
okay.
It was one of the wardrobe ladies on

2701
01:59:15,761 --> 01:59:18,070
Newsradio.
She told me that.

2702
01:59:18,130 --> 01:59:20,650
I was like,
what did she seem pretty cool?

2703
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:23,830
So I just listened to her and back then
you couldn't really look anything up.

2704
01:59:23,940 --> 01:59:25,450
Now I haven't looked.
Is it true?

2705
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:27,640
Confirmed by urban dictionary.
But I thought,

2706
01:59:27,641 --> 01:59:32,641
well then texting urban dictionary is
Hashtag woke what top definition Hashtag

2707
01:59:35,201 --> 01:59:37,960
woke anyone could add to Irv urban
dictionary.

2708
01:59:38,050 --> 01:59:42,280
That doesn't mean it's real.
Native wa a method developed by native

2709
01:59:42,280 --> 01:59:44,830
Americans to conserve as much food as
possible during deadly winters.

2710
01:59:44,831 --> 01:59:47,980
The act involved sitting through,
sifting through Ugh,

2711
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:53,290
feces for chunks of corn and nuts.
Sleeping Wolf,

2712
01:59:53,291 --> 01:59:56,320
my little bear.
Your poo is rich with the second

2713
01:59:56,321 --> 01:59:56,921
harvest.
Oh,

2714
01:59:56,921 --> 01:59:57,754
that's not real.

2715
01:59:59,910 --> 02:00:02,430
Yeah,
you can get very porn.

2716
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:07,170
By the way,
I'm connected now to a group of all

2717
02:00:07,171 --> 02:00:09,280
outright furries.
I am,

2718
02:00:09,281 --> 02:00:10,930
um,
I'm investigating.

2719
02:00:11,140 --> 02:00:13,090
I'm a journalist.
I told you earlier today,

2720
02:00:13,660 --> 02:00:17,350
and I'm investigating outright furries
cause a white,

2721
02:00:17,380 --> 02:00:20,840
white people who go crazy who are,
um,

2722
02:00:21,340 --> 02:00:25,090
very reactionary and quick to jump the
gun and call everybody a racist.

2723
02:00:25,510 --> 02:00:28,520
Wrote this article about,
um,

2724
02:00:30,580 --> 02:00:31,810
I don't know if it was a white person
wrote it.

2725
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:34,600
I just assume probably wasn't about,
um,

2726
02:00:35,170 --> 02:00:40,170
these Nazi furries like Neo Nazi
furries.

2727
02:00:40,390 --> 02:00:42,700
Well,
the absurd obscure a subculture of

2728
02:00:42,701 --> 02:00:44,770
furries has a problem with neonazis.

2729
02:00:47,430 --> 02:00:50,470
Any groups of sexual abuses.
Here's a lot of Nazis.

2730
02:00:50,471 --> 02:00:52,480
I mean,
cut the fucking shit.

2731
02:00:52,481 --> 02:00:54,490
Please.
Just please cut the shit.

2732
02:00:54,850 --> 02:00:55,930
Please,
please.

2733
02:00:55,960 --> 02:00:57,670
I can't,
I can't keep going.

2734
02:00:57,910 --> 02:00:59,770
I can't,
I can't keep going.

2735
02:00:59,771 --> 02:01:03,790
It's just too crazy.
Every day it's more and more fucking

2736
02:01:03,791 --> 02:01:06,640
weird.
This stuff I can get.

2737
02:01:07,020 --> 02:01:10,510
I think this is as the same people that
watch this youtube videos or make the

2738
02:01:10,511 --> 02:01:13,150
youtube videos.
I think the people who make the youtube

2739
02:01:13,151 --> 02:01:13,721
videos,
dude,

2740
02:01:13,721 --> 02:01:16,690
I think it's just like they're lit.
They're in Asia or somewhere like that

2741
02:01:16,691 --> 02:01:19,270
and they have a script and they just
keep throwing the script over and over

2742
02:01:19,271 --> 02:01:21,610
and we're looking for like hidden
messages in the script.

2743
02:01:21,940 --> 02:01:23,500
I think the script is probably just
fucked up.

2744
02:01:23,501 --> 02:01:26,680
They think it's fucked up to have a
cartoon character hit himself in the

2745
02:01:26,681 --> 02:01:28,690
head with a bottle.
And I think you're probably right.

2746
02:01:28,691 --> 02:01:31,630
Like maybe these fucking child
predators,

2747
02:01:31,750 --> 02:01:33,940
maybe they communicate on all sorts of
different websites.

2748
02:01:33,970 --> 02:01:35,260
Maybe they just decide like,
hey,

2749
02:01:35,261 --> 02:01:39,800
let's meet on this tire forum and we'll
just say things in code and attire means

2750
02:01:39,801 --> 02:01:40,280
this.

2751
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:42,080
I mean it wasn't that always the shit
with pizza gate.

2752
02:01:42,140 --> 02:01:44,030
Like they thought that they were talking
in code.

2753
02:01:44,270 --> 02:01:47,450
Like all the conspiracy theorists
thought that a slice of pizza meant like

2754
02:01:47,451 --> 02:01:51,710
a kid and the youtube one,
I mean them being there being so many of

2755
02:01:51,711 --> 02:01:53,270
them sort of says that there's money in
it.

2756
02:01:53,810 --> 02:01:56,750
They've tapped into an algorithm and
they're just beating it to death.

2757
02:01:56,840 --> 02:01:58,700
Yeah,
and they just have the same script and

2758
02:01:58,701 --> 02:02:00,770
they just do it with a computer change.
One little thing,

2759
02:02:00,830 --> 02:02:02,810
little thing here and there and that's
what I think it is.

2760
02:02:02,811 --> 02:02:04,640
I think it's not as nefarious as
everybody likes to think,

2761
02:02:04,641 --> 02:02:09,380
but it's really fucking weird to keep
seeing the same video playing out over

2762
02:02:09,381 --> 02:02:12,050
and over again with a bottle flies
through the hair and the baby gets hit

2763
02:02:12,051 --> 02:02:13,840
in the fucking head.
You'd floods.

2764
02:02:14,300 --> 02:02:15,770
I think the activity was a little weird.

2765
02:02:15,770 --> 02:02:18,110
Or when it's people actually people
doing it.

2766
02:02:18,180 --> 02:02:21,170
You can't just have a computer make it
to where people are.

2767
02:02:21,171 --> 02:02:23,720
God damn nuts.
They're nuts and they're out there.

2768
02:02:24,110 --> 02:02:24,960
I like furries.
Uh,

2769
02:02:25,030 --> 02:02:29,090
I th I get that.
I have a bunch of outfits that I make

2770
02:02:29,091 --> 02:02:31,370
videos with and stuff and that's pretty
much what that is.

2771
02:02:31,371 --> 02:02:34,500
That's just basically cross play.
Any kind of a roleplay.

2772
02:02:34,720 --> 02:02:35,553
Yeah,
they're having fun,

2773
02:02:35,690 --> 02:02:38,060
having fun.
They don't feel like normies.

2774
02:02:38,310 --> 02:02:39,170
Right.
I'll say it right.

2775
02:02:39,650 --> 02:02:42,020
Yeah.
And I'm sure having sex like that,

2776
02:02:42,021 --> 02:02:44,150
it's probably fine.
And that's Kinky.

2777
02:02:44,151 --> 02:02:44,751
Like,
hey,

2778
02:02:44,751 --> 02:02:47,420
you're dressed up as my pretty pony and
I'm spiderman.

2779
02:02:47,910 --> 02:02:50,090
Yeah.
Probably a lot of that.

2780
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:53,390
A lot of dude on dude crime.
Other words,

2781
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:58,400
these hats,
they're wearing fucking weird animal

2782
02:02:59,661 --> 02:03:02,490
hats and their bone in each other.
Paints.

2783
02:03:02,570 --> 02:03:04,520
Why not man?
But you know why?

2784
02:03:04,550 --> 02:03:05,720
Because this is crazy.

2785
02:03:05,870 --> 02:03:08,090
So why not?
Why to do it?

2786
02:03:08,120 --> 02:03:09,480
Why not do it?
See,

2787
02:03:09,481 --> 02:03:11,540
look at that.
Just like a Fox and you're fucking each

2788
02:03:11,541 --> 02:03:14,090
other in the Fox is fucking the chicken.
Why not?

2789
02:03:14,750 --> 02:03:15,531
Why?
Really?

2790
02:03:15,531 --> 02:03:16,490
Why not?
I just,

2791
02:03:16,491 --> 02:03:17,211
I don't know.
Why not?

2792
02:03:17,211 --> 02:03:22,211
I can't tell you why not.
Why is it okay that people were crazy

2793
02:03:22,341 --> 02:03:27,341
fake eyelashes and extensions in their
hair and they pumped fat into their ass

2794
02:03:27,531 --> 02:03:30,620
and put silicone bags and their tits?
Why is that okay,

2795
02:03:30,650 --> 02:03:33,500
but it's not okay to dress like a big
chicken and get fucked by a big rooster.

2796
02:03:35,720 --> 02:03:38,510
Why isn't it?
Why can't you pretend to be like a fox

2797
02:03:38,511 --> 02:03:39,640
in the hen house,
right?

2798
02:03:39,680 --> 02:03:42,440
Why not?
Like if as long as everybody agrees,

2799
02:03:42,860 --> 02:03:44,420
like do you agree to be the Fox?
Okay,

2800
02:03:44,421 --> 02:03:46,580
cool.
Them dog.

2801
02:03:46,820 --> 02:03:49,760
I'm going to be the bulldog mascot,
the big bulldog head and we're going to

2802
02:03:49,761 --> 02:03:51,800
bone.
They're going to make some,

2803
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:53,930
some rendezvous was,
why the fuck not?

2804
02:03:54,620 --> 02:03:56,120
Why not?
Yeah,

2805
02:03:56,121 --> 02:03:57,980
I'm down for that.
They just do whatever they want.

2806
02:03:58,040 --> 02:04:00,050
I mean,
I dressed my grow up as a school girl.

2807
02:04:00,110 --> 02:04:02,000
You know she's Asian.
There you go.

2808
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:05,180
Why not dress her up like a anime school
girl?

2809
02:04:05,210 --> 02:04:07,430
Give her a big fake head.
Where would it be?

2810
02:04:07,431 --> 02:04:11,810
A boner with a big fake head on big
anime eyes can actually kind of crazy

2811
02:04:12,440 --> 02:04:15,110
fake ponytail.
I got her,

2812
02:04:15,540 --> 02:04:17,210
I got her some tentacles.
The other day.

2813
02:04:17,660 --> 02:04:18,900
Wow.
Technical Butler.

2814
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:20,960
That's the weird thing.
So tentacle Porn,

2815
02:04:20,990 --> 02:04:24,350
how did that ever take off member?
That was the thing when we first found

2816
02:04:24,351 --> 02:04:26,600
out about tentacle porn,
I remember like collectively the

2817
02:04:26,601 --> 02:04:27,530
Internet was like,
what?

2818
02:04:28,100 --> 02:04:30,200
Wait a minute.
How much of this stuff is existing?

2819
02:04:30,420 --> 02:04:32,000
How much?
How much is out there?

2820
02:04:32,120 --> 02:04:37,120
What the fuck is going on in Japan?
Tentacle Porn was a loophole for or

2821
02:04:37,541 --> 02:04:41,250
report insertion because she can't show
a insertion.

2822
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:42,673
Yeah.

2823
02:04:43,340 --> 02:04:47,050
See like energy finds a way.
You have the,

2824
02:04:47,180 --> 02:04:50,000
it finds the weakest link and it makes
its way through.

2825
02:04:50,060 --> 02:04:53,500
You can't suppress it.
That's why I like what you see with

2826
02:04:53,510 --> 02:04:56,060
Catholic priests.
That's why you see in this.

2827
02:04:56,930 --> 02:04:58,490
You can't show penetration,
Huh?

2828
02:04:58,520 --> 02:04:59,353
Huh?
Huh.

2829
02:04:59,450 --> 02:05:03,400
Okay.
How about crackings with a,

2830
02:05:03,401 --> 02:05:08,401
a dick on the end of every octopus arm
and they're banging eight different

2831
02:05:08,901 --> 02:05:10,070
school girls.
How about that?

2832
02:05:10,310 --> 02:05:11,270
Good.
Cool.

2833
02:05:11,300 --> 02:05:12,530
Here's the,
here's the magazine.

2834
02:05:12,680 --> 02:05:13,513
Thanks.

2835
02:05:14,890 --> 02:05:17,320
They're all school girls.
Japan is so weird,

2836
02:05:17,321 --> 02:05:19,240
man.
Big veiny Dick.

2837
02:05:19,250 --> 02:05:21,400
So it'll like ripping their lower jaw
out,

2838
02:05:21,610 --> 02:05:24,280
but it's just coming out of an octopus
so it's okay.

2839
02:05:25,780 --> 02:05:28,540
Have you seen their game show called
like slippery stairs

2840
02:05:30,100 --> 02:05:33,730
the other day?
I wonder what the,

2841
02:05:33,731 --> 02:05:36,620
like the cheating would be a,
how would you cheated?

2842
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:39,970
Slippery stairs seemingly someone in
America would figure out a way to buck

2843
02:05:39,971 --> 02:05:40,780
the system.
Right?

2844
02:05:40,780 --> 02:05:43,750
I would say it would have something to
do with pulling the other guys down.

2845
02:05:43,980 --> 02:05:46,000
Yeah.
I don't think you can touch them though.

2846
02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:49,090
I don't think so.
Can you?

2847
02:05:49,180 --> 02:05:49,960
Yeah,
I think you can.

2848
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:52,420
If you did,
I think people would just get ahead and

2849
02:05:52,421 --> 02:05:54,010
you would never let anybody get close to
you,

2850
02:05:54,040 --> 02:05:56,640
but I think the problem is for people
listening,

2851
02:05:56,670 --> 02:06:01,110
it's,
Oh my God,

2852
02:06:01,120 --> 02:06:02,800
he was there.
Oh my God.

2853
02:06:02,801 --> 02:06:04,210
He was there.
He took everybody out like a bowling

2854
02:06:04,211 --> 02:06:06,040
ball.
This is amazing.

2855
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:08,320
It's amazing.
And then the other guy went down to the

2856
02:06:08,321 --> 02:06:10,990
guy who was ahead of them.
He got cocky and he fell all the way

2857
02:06:10,991 --> 02:06:11,660
back.
Yeah.

2858
02:06:11,660 --> 02:06:13,510
This is a great show.
That looks fun.

2859
02:06:13,780 --> 02:06:15,750
It looks like they should call it like
tooth,

2860
02:06:15,751 --> 02:06:17,950
the chipper or something like that.
Who would be a good host to this?

2861
02:06:18,250 --> 02:06:22,240
You know it's somebody else who'd be a
good host.

2862
02:06:22,241 --> 02:06:25,540
Tony Hinchcliffe be good host.
Maybe not.

2863
02:06:29,020 --> 02:06:29,890
I would love it.
Dude.

2864
02:06:29,891 --> 02:06:32,290
Japanese game show cause they,
that's just one.

2865
02:06:32,291 --> 02:06:34,330
Jesus Christ popular.
Perfect for it.

2866
02:06:34,340 --> 02:06:36,370
Yeah.
Koreans and Japanese people don't get

2867
02:06:36,371 --> 02:06:37,930
along.
So it'd be even better.

2868
02:06:37,990 --> 02:06:39,290
Yeah,
it's girl.

2869
02:06:39,340 --> 02:06:43,270
There'd be people mad at him.
Did you know that Koreans and Japanese

2870
02:06:43,271 --> 02:06:45,490
people have a sorted history?
Absolutely.

2871
02:06:46,360 --> 02:06:48,310
Um,
oh Jesus Christ.

2872
02:06:48,311 --> 02:06:51,400
Your speed skating down at like a slope.
Oh my God.

2873
02:06:51,401 --> 02:06:54,490
This is insane.
There's the two other sports and this

2874
02:06:54,491 --> 02:06:56,500
was one of them and that slippery stair
thing came out.

2875
02:06:56,501 --> 02:06:57,334
I was like,
this new,

2876
02:06:57,350 --> 02:06:58,420
this is new.
Very,

2877
02:06:58,421 --> 02:07:00,910
very,
this as to fall [inaudible] 13 a red

2878
02:07:00,911 --> 02:07:02,950
bull.
This is insane.

2879
02:07:02,980 --> 02:07:04,150
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

2880
02:07:04,151 --> 02:07:05,640
These guys are gone.
Saw.

2881
02:07:05,900 --> 02:07:08,320
This is incredible.
People are hanging over the edge.

2882
02:07:08,440 --> 02:07:10,420
I hope people don't smack them.
What's this called?

2883
02:07:10,421 --> 02:07:11,700
Ice Logos.
Lizzy.

2884
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,990
Crack crashed ice I think is what it's
called,

2885
02:07:13,991 --> 02:07:16,030
but it's like,
oh,

2886
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:17,830
this is insane.

2887
02:07:18,160 --> 02:07:22,420
It's like a downhill hockey speed.
Cross x type.

2888
02:07:22,470 --> 02:07:23,890
I don't know.
It's real weird event.

2889
02:07:24,220 --> 02:07:26,590
Just a matter of time before somebody
figures something like this out,

2890
02:07:26,591 --> 02:07:28,870
right?
Like eventually people just make things

2891
02:07:28,871 --> 02:07:29,860
crazy and crazy.
You're like,

2892
02:07:29,861 --> 02:07:32,470
this is way better than like a lot of
shows.

2893
02:07:32,770 --> 02:07:37,090
Like just look at this right now.
Just the just intensity of this race,

2894
02:07:37,510 --> 02:07:40,390
and now compare this to golf,
right?

2895
02:07:40,450 --> 02:07:42,730
If you watch golf on TV,
this is riveting.

2896
02:07:43,990 --> 02:07:46,150
Like this is way more riveting than
people racing cars,

2897
02:07:46,151 --> 02:07:48,100
isn't it?
People stop playing football.

2898
02:07:48,101 --> 02:07:49,450
They're going to want to do something
crazy.

2899
02:07:49,530 --> 02:07:50,710
Yeah.
This must be it.

2900
02:07:50,890 --> 02:07:53,320
Roller Derby Downhill,
pretty much.

2901
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:56,110
But this is an agility thing.
You know,

2902
02:07:56,140 --> 02:07:59,710
like Wayne Gretzky was not a big guy,
but he had incredible agility on the

2903
02:07:59,711 --> 02:08:02,110
ice.
Like you would have to be like one of

2904
02:08:02,111 --> 02:08:05,650
those Badass hockey players.
Like bieber is bieber hockey pile.

2905
02:08:05,660 --> 02:08:06,910
Yeah.
Justin Bieber.

2906
02:08:06,940 --> 02:08:09,550
Yeah.
Imagine if he became like the top dog in

2907
02:08:09,551 --> 02:08:10,720
this stuff.
It just,

2908
02:08:11,080 --> 02:08:12,820
people are so mad at him.
He's a little punk.

2909
02:08:12,821 --> 02:08:15,430
He can't be good at this too.
Piece of shit.

2910
02:08:15,700 --> 02:08:17,100
He's also a boxer.
Thunder.

2911
02:08:17,140 --> 02:08:19,460
That's a boxing and ass.
Nice somebody.

2912
02:08:19,461 --> 02:08:21,130
He's talked to him about the amount of
tattoos.

2913
02:08:21,250 --> 02:08:22,510
I'll be the guy,
hey,

2914
02:08:22,720 --> 02:08:24,610
stop.
Stop.

2915
02:08:24,670 --> 02:08:27,040
Which to do your stomach covered
yourself up with tattoos.

2916
02:08:27,070 --> 02:08:28,240
Settle,
Bro,

2917
02:08:28,241 --> 02:08:29,980
you're young.
I get it going crazy.

2918
02:08:30,610 --> 02:08:32,800
Got All the money in the world.
You're balling,

2919
02:08:33,220 --> 02:08:35,770
banging bitches left and right.
I get it son.

2920
02:08:35,800 --> 02:08:38,080
Just slow down your tattoos on your
chest.

2921
02:08:38,081 --> 02:08:40,890
Don't make sense.
Is that unless there,

2922
02:08:41,200 --> 02:08:43,650
does he have a Lesnar?
What does that and that's across anyone.

2923
02:08:43,890 --> 02:08:45,670
One of those things in the bottom is
that a ship?

2924
02:08:46,270 --> 02:08:49,600
What does a lion?
A bear.

2925
02:08:50,550 --> 02:08:51,320
What?
Eagle.

2926
02:08:51,320 --> 02:08:52,210
That's an eagle,
right?

2927
02:08:52,210 --> 02:08:55,210
Here's the need.
What are those things above it guy?

2928
02:08:56,080 --> 02:08:57,890
There's so much chaos going on there.
What's up?

2929
02:08:57,891 --> 02:09:00,310
But the nipple lines,
one of the things,

2930
02:09:00,311 --> 02:09:03,310
if you talked to tattoo artists,
like they want to make sure that like

2931
02:09:03,311 --> 02:09:06,550
design stand out,
you know like the rocks Tattoo,

2932
02:09:06,580 --> 02:09:09,770
right?
And Nikko Hurtado Rose Tattoo the rock.

2933
02:09:09,800 --> 02:09:11,950
It's arm.
See how that stood out?

2934
02:09:12,280 --> 02:09:13,750
Like it popped,
right?

2935
02:09:14,230 --> 02:09:17,710
That's because Nico is a master.
Not that this guy isn't covering that

2936
02:09:17,711 --> 02:09:18,830
up.
I think whatever it is,

2937
02:09:18,850 --> 02:09:19,860
he had some written,
oh,

2938
02:09:20,280 --> 02:09:21,400
oh he had something written.
Well,

2939
02:09:21,401 --> 02:09:23,290
hey bro,
get that shit lasered.

2940
02:09:23,980 --> 02:09:25,900
That's,
that's a lot of laser,

2941
02:09:26,940 --> 02:09:28,240
you know,
be a man.

2942
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:30,010
This lie.
They like this.

2943
02:09:30,040 --> 02:09:33,220
Ah,
pretend that lasers making it more

2944
02:09:33,221 --> 02:09:34,054
powerful.

2945
02:09:36,550 --> 02:09:41,550
So you gotta think you gotta think with
eat with us paying I grow with each one.

2946
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:42,970
I'd be calm.
Stronger.

2947
02:09:44,190 --> 02:09:47,590
Yeah.
You don't write over writing when you

2948
02:09:47,591 --> 02:09:49,660
can erase it.
Everybody knows that.

2949
02:09:50,110 --> 02:09:52,450
Why would you ever know you don't do
that?

2950
02:09:52,840 --> 02:09:54,280
Don't do that.
Burn it off.

2951
02:09:54,281 --> 02:09:56,620
At least there's a way around what
you're doing.

2952
02:09:56,980 --> 02:09:58,670
Okay.
That's a way around it.

2953
02:09:58,990 --> 02:10:00,300
There's people that get those.
Uh,

2954
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:04,990
what does this branding,
branding that's gusting open.

2955
02:10:04,991 --> 02:10:08,560
St prue has that.
He's a top UFC light heavyweight.

2956
02:10:08,830 --> 02:10:09,870
He's got that,
uh,

2957
02:10:09,910 --> 02:10:12,070
like one of the fraternity things that
his arm,

2958
02:10:12,071 --> 02:10:13,750
he's a football player.
Tennessee.

2959
02:10:14,350 --> 02:10:15,880
Yeah.
He does that thing too.

2960
02:10:15,881 --> 02:10:18,600
When he wins sometimes it makes the,
what is it you,

2961
02:10:19,120 --> 02:10:21,190
it's there.
I forget what it was.

2962
02:10:21,230 --> 02:10:23,080
It's crazy.
A lot of basketball players used to do

2963
02:10:23,081 --> 02:10:24,430
it.
I think Michael Jordan's also in that

2964
02:10:24,431 --> 02:10:28,150
frat fraternity shit.
They banned all fraternities at Ohio

2965
02:10:28,151 --> 02:10:29,610
state the other day.
Too much rate.

2966
02:10:30,020 --> 02:10:30,910
Yeah.
It happened.

2967
02:10:30,911 --> 02:10:32,350
Yeah.
The kids get to rape at all.

2968
02:10:32,351 --> 02:10:33,950
Shut down there.
That's crazy.

2969
02:10:34,310 --> 02:10:37,220
All the hazing or something was going on
probably that they should never have

2970
02:10:37,221 --> 02:10:39,280
fraternities anyways.
Well,

2971
02:10:40,190 --> 02:10:42,940
you are guaranteeing some crazy shit's
gonna go down.

2972
02:10:42,970 --> 02:10:45,130
It's like you're just going to,
you're going to have to have some sort

2973
02:10:45,131 --> 02:10:46,860
of an agreement.
Like how much crazy shit are you gonna

2974
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:48,370
allow?
Because if you're going to let a bunch

2975
02:10:48,371 --> 02:10:52,660
of dudes who are just starting to have
boners all live together in a house,

2976
02:10:52,690 --> 02:10:54,490
they have a house like they let girls
in.

2977
02:10:54,530 --> 02:10:56,050
Can they let girls?
Then they're gonna open the door.

2978
02:10:56,200 --> 02:10:57,430
Girls can come in,
can they drank?

2979
02:10:57,460 --> 02:10:58,293
They can.
Okay,

2980
02:10:58,300 --> 02:11:01,270
what the fuck are you doing?
I can get a bunch of people that are

2981
02:11:01,390 --> 02:11:04,780
dude's shacked up with other dude
smelling each other's butts,

2982
02:11:06,010 --> 02:11:10,030
getting crazy together.
I'll fucking drank and I watching movies

2983
02:11:10,180 --> 02:11:14,350
of every bachelor party,
every fucking fraternity movie ever.

2984
02:11:14,410 --> 02:11:17,290
We get a group of guys together.
Every fucking,

2985
02:11:18,340 --> 02:11:21,550
what is the,
the hangover.

2986
02:11:21,670 --> 02:11:22,780
The hangovers.
Another example,

2987
02:11:22,810 --> 02:11:24,160
every time you get a bunch of guys
together,

2988
02:11:24,310 --> 02:11:26,200
fucking chaos,
chaos.

2989
02:11:26,230 --> 02:11:28,300
Every single movie,
you get 10 guys together,

2990
02:11:28,301 --> 02:11:29,720
they go somewhere.
Wow.

2991
02:11:29,980 --> 02:11:31,420
Is that a control?
People getting punched?

2992
02:11:31,421 --> 02:11:33,370
Somebody get shot always.
Right.

2993
02:11:33,371 --> 02:11:37,060
So imagine you're letting these 18 year
olds who don't even know how to control

2994
02:11:37,061 --> 02:11:38,490
their bodies yet.
You're,

2995
02:11:38,491 --> 02:11:40,330
you're barely an adult.
You can't even believe.

2996
02:11:40,331 --> 02:11:42,490
You can think for yourself.
You can decide when to wake up.

2997
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:44,080
Your parents aren't there with you
anymore.

2998
02:11:44,540 --> 02:11:47,230
Finally,
your dad is not fucking pissed at you

2999
02:11:47,231 --> 02:11:48,810
because you forgot to mow the lawn and
like,

3000
02:11:49,040 --> 02:11:51,520
fuck you dad.
I'm not here to mow your lawn,

3001
02:11:51,521 --> 02:11:52,750
Bro.
Okay,

3002
02:11:53,650 --> 02:11:54,950
the next thing you know,
you're,

3003
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:56,980
I know that other,
and a bunch of dudes are just like you

3004
02:11:57,160 --> 02:12:00,010
and you're all drunk and girls come over
and they're drunk too.

3005
02:12:00,420 --> 02:12:01,870
You're like,
Holy Shit,

3006
02:12:01,871 --> 02:12:02,830
this is the best

3007
02:12:04,360 --> 02:12:05,950
laurie about life.
Make some mistakes.

3008
02:12:06,010 --> 02:12:09,790
You weren't no frat parties work crazy
though.

3009
02:12:09,820 --> 02:12:10,510
I mean,
they were,

3010
02:12:10,510 --> 02:12:12,850
they would have like hookers there.
That's where all the drugs,

3011
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:15,340
when you first saw like drugs and you're
like,

3012
02:12:15,341 --> 02:12:17,890
what the hell?
There's drugs here the most,

3013
02:12:17,910 --> 02:12:21,690
the closest to a frat.
I live with two dudes once and uh,

3014
02:12:21,960 --> 02:12:25,480
there were good guys sorta.
One of them was a little fucked up,

3015
02:12:25,870 --> 02:12:29,080
but it was a,
how about a bunch of men together like

3016
02:12:29,081 --> 02:12:31,450
that?
It's just super sketchy.

3017
02:12:31,480 --> 02:12:33,580
It's unnecessary.
It's super sketchy.

3018
02:12:33,860 --> 02:12:35,320
You can go,
you can go bad.

3019
02:12:36,120 --> 02:12:39,160
But bunch of young guys,
I remember hearing stories of,

3020
02:12:39,161 --> 02:12:41,650
it wasn't even a Frat,
but it was like the ski club house at

3021
02:12:41,651 --> 02:12:44,770
Ohio State would have 30 kegs at their
parties on Saturday.

3022
02:12:44,771 --> 02:12:46,690
Yeah.
It's like there's 15 people living in a

3023
02:12:46,691 --> 02:12:49,040
house.
What the fuck is that?

3024
02:12:49,570 --> 02:12:51,440
Don't do that.
That's not good.

3025
02:12:52,600 --> 02:12:56,620
That's not good.
Plus Alpha plus liquor plus plus all the

3026
02:12:56,621 --> 02:12:58,120
other things.
Yeah man.

3027
02:12:58,121 --> 02:12:59,710
When you get a bunch of people living
together

3028
02:13:00,570 --> 02:13:04,170
and especially when you're young,
you make shitty decisions and then the

3029
02:13:04,171 --> 02:13:06,060
three of you are making shitty decisions
are the four,

3030
02:13:06,070 --> 02:13:09,240
the five or the 10 all like the same
age.

3031
02:13:09,241 --> 02:13:12,870
I'll just as dumb all fucking trying to
out agro each other.

3032
02:13:13,650 --> 02:13:15,540
All out of hammered.
Come on,

3033
02:13:16,650 --> 02:13:20,550
you know.
And then on the other side you've got

3034
02:13:20,551 --> 02:13:24,630
some crazy bitch who finally got away
from her dad and cheese.

3035
02:13:24,660 --> 02:13:29,660
Fucking Jack and nobody tell me she
and everybody figures out life together.

3036
02:13:32,410 --> 02:13:33,750
Yeah,
we should keep sororities.

3037
02:13:33,751 --> 02:13:38,751
Definitely
they have sorority still at Ohio state,

3038
02:13:41,041 --> 02:13:41,820
right?
Because they're like,

3039
02:13:41,820 --> 02:13:43,260
oh Scott.
I think it was both of them.

3040
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:44,880
Oh really?
I only heard,

3041
02:13:44,940 --> 02:13:47,360
I only heard fraternities.
I think sororities like good cause it's

3042
02:13:47,380 --> 02:13:49,950
about dorm rooms.
I mean dorm rooms.

3043
02:13:50,070 --> 02:13:52,190
And what about that?
Dorms are crazy toward him,

3044
02:13:52,200 --> 02:13:53,820
sir.
Everybody knows dorms are crazy.

3045
02:13:53,970 --> 02:13:56,160
They're just not.
The thing about dorms is you don't have

3046
02:13:56,161 --> 02:13:57,030
to join.
Right.

3047
02:13:57,060 --> 02:14:00,630
Dorms are like more egalitarian cause
like you get to have a bunch of people

3048
02:14:00,820 --> 02:14:03,960
did like different things,
different interests,

3049
02:14:03,961 --> 02:14:06,080
different.
They're just different men and women,

3050
02:14:06,090 --> 02:14:08,280
different parts of the world.
Everybody lumped together in this dorm.

3051
02:14:08,281 --> 02:14:11,490
They all just can't really afford an
apartment.

3052
02:14:11,491 --> 02:14:13,530
And they're all living together in this
university setting.

3053
02:14:14,150 --> 02:14:17,220
But they could be anybody.
Your net and you roommate could be

3054
02:14:17,221 --> 02:14:20,170
anybody got to share a bathroom with
everyone in the hall.

3055
02:14:20,580 --> 02:14:23,160
That one shit in the news recently where
that woman was,

3056
02:14:23,340 --> 02:14:26,340
uh,
they didn't get along and had a dorm and

3057
02:14:26,341 --> 02:14:29,700
so the woman was like putting her
toothbrush in her ass.

3058
02:14:29,950 --> 02:14:33,900
She started getting sick and they found
out that she was doing all this shit.

3059
02:14:34,110 --> 02:14:35,820
Oh my God.
How'd they find out?

3060
02:14:35,821 --> 02:14:36,730
Hidden Camera,
uh,

3061
02:14:36,900 --> 02:14:37,711
toilet camp?
No,

3062
02:14:37,711 --> 02:14:39,810
I don't.
She probably sued because she got

3063
02:14:40,740 --> 02:14:44,460
something in her ass white woman
arrested for torturing black students.

3064
02:14:44,461 --> 02:14:48,080
She called Jamaican Jamaican Barbie.
Whoa.

3065
02:14:48,220 --> 02:14:50,970
And I guess she admitted to it on
facebook or something like that.

3066
02:14:51,060 --> 02:14:51,930
Oh yeah.
She's like,

3067
02:14:52,050 --> 02:14:56,450
how's the people rallied at Ucla and set
fire to a trump and Yada unrelenting

3068
02:14:56,470 --> 02:14:59,490
story.
It's unrelated.

3069
02:14:59,830 --> 02:15:01,440
It's showing up on here,
but at the video,

3070
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:05,550
this is all just about various pieces of
racism that people are finding.

3071
02:15:06,020 --> 02:15:06,811
Huh.
Wow,

3072
02:15:06,811 --> 02:15:07,890
that's crazy,
man.

3073
02:15:08,580 --> 02:15:10,980
That's fucked up.
Magine stick in someone's tooth,

3074
02:15:10,981 --> 02:15:14,040
brushing your asshole and then watching
them brush teeth with it.

3075
02:15:14,710 --> 02:15:19,170
Clam dip in or lotions rubbing.
Use tampons on her backpack for a month.

3076
02:15:19,260 --> 02:15:20,700
Oh my God.
That's what she did.

3077
02:15:20,770 --> 02:15:23,460
She,
she did crazy shit to this poor girl,

3078
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:25,650
which probably want to hear buzzing.
Yeah,

3079
02:15:26,010 --> 02:15:28,770
she probably wanted to it just probably
like fighting off the gay.

3080
02:15:28,830 --> 02:15:30,660
Yeah.
Look at this and then she tweeted about

3081
02:15:30,661 --> 02:15:31,570
it.
Oh my God.

3082
02:15:31,571 --> 02:15:33,330
She treated it.
Come on,

3083
02:15:33,870 --> 02:15:36,360
I can finally say goodbye.
Did you make and Barbie.

3084
02:15:37,740 --> 02:15:40,200
Oh my God.
Make that a little bigger.

3085
02:15:41,910 --> 02:15:45,210
Finally I did it.
Yo girl got rid of her roommate after

3086
02:15:45,211 --> 02:15:48,390
one and a half month of spitting in her
coconut oil,

3087
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:51,390
putting moldy clam dip and her lotions
rubbing,

3088
02:15:51,391 --> 02:15:54,240
use tampons in her backpack,
putting her toothbrush and places where

3089
02:15:54,241 --> 02:15:58,410
the sun doesn't shine and so much more.
I can finally say goodbye.

3090
02:15:58,411 --> 02:16:02,130
Jamaican Barbie.
She said she was making that up as part

3091
02:16:02,131 --> 02:16:04,300
of her defense,
but whether or not she wasn't not,

3092
02:16:04,301 --> 02:16:06,630
I don't know.
Story came out a couple of weeks ago.

3093
02:16:06,790 --> 02:16:07,830
Yeah.
See the thing is like,

3094
02:16:07,831 --> 02:16:10,830
you might think it'd be funny to say
something like that and make it up and

3095
02:16:10,831 --> 02:16:12,300
it might be made up.
That's true.

3096
02:16:12,900 --> 02:16:16,080
You might think it's funny to make,
but boy did you fuck up by saying that

3097
02:16:17,530 --> 02:16:19,770
like you gotta make something like that
up and then put it on the Internet where

3098
02:16:19,771 --> 02:16:22,440
anybody can find out about it.
That seems crazy.

3099
02:16:24,810 --> 02:16:29,350
I guess you can test her toothbrush and
stuff like that for every day.

3100
02:16:29,450 --> 02:16:30,283
Like you have the time.

3101
02:16:30,360 --> 02:16:32,320
Do you have to know when the last time
you tested your toothbrush for,

3102
02:16:32,321 --> 02:16:36,670
but juice every well has it.
Yeah.

3103
02:16:36,700 --> 02:16:39,020
That's one of those things people just
don't test for.

3104
02:16:39,950 --> 02:16:42,160
Test your toothbrush to see if it's been
someone's ass hole.

3105
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:44,530
It's just a lot of things I'm thinking
about.

3106
02:16:44,531 --> 02:16:45,730
It's not one of them.
Yeah,

3107
02:16:45,950 --> 02:16:47,200
and I just,
how bad they hit each other,

3108
02:16:47,201 --> 02:16:48,750
but that called them on a stick.
A tooth brush.

3109
02:16:48,780 --> 02:16:53,780
My brows bitch eat my shit.
Well that's a sick type of person.

3110
02:16:53,941 --> 02:16:55,900
I'll sit there and watch.
You brushed their teeth,

3111
02:16:57,080 --> 02:17:01,360
their asshole juices.
Good in there for a weekend in the gums

3112
02:17:01,810 --> 02:17:03,840
and the gums allegedly.
Yeah.

3113
02:17:04,510 --> 02:17:05,800
Hmm.
I wonder if she did it.

3114
02:17:06,040 --> 02:17:07,510
She did do it.
That's a sick bitch.

3115
02:17:08,380 --> 02:17:11,920
Ooh.
Magine as in the thought that has to go

3116
02:17:11,921 --> 02:17:13,120
through your head to do something like
that.

3117
02:17:14,620 --> 02:17:16,810
Maybe she didn't realize how gross other
people would find it.

3118
02:17:17,140 --> 02:17:19,240
That's the crazy thing that she told
everybody.

3119
02:17:19,270 --> 02:17:21,250
Like people would probably been doing
that to each other forever.

3120
02:17:21,430 --> 02:17:24,810
I think the first thing she did or was
it a slow build up?

3121
02:17:29,710 --> 02:17:34,460
This is a spin brush right to the lower
ribs frauds,

3122
02:17:35,770 --> 02:17:39,800
frauds at the lower ribs and she's,
she's got the toothbrush like this with

3123
02:17:39,801 --> 02:17:43,180
their fingers.
What she's like barely got the bottom of

3124
02:17:43,181 --> 02:17:46,390
the toothbrush.
She's knuckle deep in her own ass hall

3125
02:17:46,570 --> 02:17:50,520
and she barely has the bottom of the
toothbrush and she's got a kind of user

3126
02:17:50,530 --> 02:17:54,880
shit muscles to force it out when she
could pinch down on and pull it out and

3127
02:17:54,881 --> 02:17:56,290
sometimes she has to do it over and
over.

3128
02:17:56,291 --> 02:17:59,470
And again man,
I wonder what you imagine you get a

3129
02:17:59,471 --> 02:18:04,471
drink prune juice to try to get that
toothbrush out of your household and you

3130
02:18:04,991 --> 02:18:06,940
got to keep,
you don't want it to hit the wall coming

3131
02:18:06,941 --> 02:18:11,380
out and then bounce back up.
So you've got to really open it wide so

3132
02:18:11,381 --> 02:18:14,110
like you probably got to have to wear
like long gloves,

3133
02:18:14,320 --> 02:18:18,010
you know like Lube your ass all up and
they just were like some of the gloves

3134
02:18:18,011 --> 02:18:20,320
you wear when you like clean and bundles
of sticks and shit.

3135
02:18:20,610 --> 02:18:22,690
Those,
you know those ones made out of swings

3136
02:18:23,020 --> 02:18:28,020
this way.
Good grip on things that are slippery.

3137
02:18:30,990 --> 02:18:34,030
He's pulling your butter part,
trying to get that toothbrush out and

3138
02:18:34,031 --> 02:18:37,240
right when it gets out,
you hear the keys in the door.

3139
02:18:37,330 --> 02:18:42,330
I got the pictures back and put it in
the glass clink and you shut the door

3140
02:18:42,671 --> 02:18:44,230
and just wash your toothbrush off real
quick.

3141
02:18:44,260 --> 02:18:46,570
But you've got to dry it too because
otherwise should pick her toothbrush.

3142
02:18:46,571 --> 02:18:48,370
I would go,
why the fuck is my toothbrush already

3143
02:18:48,371 --> 02:18:53,371
wet Donna?
And like if you put toothpaste on a wet

3144
02:18:53,381 --> 02:18:54,820
toothbrush,
you know that's a fucking wet

3145
02:18:54,821 --> 02:18:56,830
toothbrush.
He looking down and I think it looks

3146
02:18:56,831 --> 02:18:58,660
different.
Why is it when you feel that your

3147
02:18:58,661 --> 02:18:59,411
finger,
you know,

3148
02:18:59,411 --> 02:19:00,640
whoa,
it's cold and wet.

3149
02:19:01,090 --> 02:19:04,240
What the fuck?
Who is just using my toothbrush?

3150
02:19:04,390 --> 02:19:06,340
You think about it?
I've been at work for nine hours.

3151
02:19:06,610 --> 02:19:08,560
How the fuck is my toothbrush?
Not Dry.

3152
02:19:08,830 --> 02:19:11,580
It would be dry or something like that
in her asshole.

3153
02:19:11,890 --> 02:19:15,580
All you smell it.
It smells like Madison,

3154
02:19:18,550 --> 02:19:21,240
Madison and Jim Poultney.
It's smells like roundup

3155
02:19:23,920 --> 02:19:28,040
and went out into the fucking garage.
Got Some lawn spray.

3156
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:31,880
Do you see that new thing that's a,
you put in your mouth and it brushes

3157
02:19:31,881 --> 02:19:34,670
your teeth for you?
Lazy?

3158
02:19:35,680 --> 02:19:38,390
Yeah.
In 30 seconds it's brushed your teeth.

3159
02:19:38,990 --> 02:19:40,490
Is it better?
I don't know.

3160
02:19:40,491 --> 02:19:43,040
It's an interesting idea that we'd like,
you know,

3161
02:19:43,041 --> 02:19:46,580
you could just put it in your mouth in
the car or something like that in 30

3162
02:19:46,581 --> 02:19:49,700
seconds later.
I don't know how proven it is and it

3163
02:19:49,701 --> 02:19:53,150
seems like it would get down now.
It's just weird.

3164
02:19:53,510 --> 02:19:58,510
I wonder how much of an impact fluoride
in the water has on preventing tooth

3165
02:19:58,551 --> 02:19:59,480
decay,
if any.

3166
02:20:00,380 --> 02:20:03,350
I've been reading about Florida and the
water and it's so hard to figure out

3167
02:20:03,351 --> 02:20:08,351
who's nuts this ten second automatic
toothbrush could save you hours every

3168
02:20:08,481 --> 02:20:09,530
year.
She's hot.

3169
02:20:09,531 --> 02:20:10,910
I hope she brushed her teeth.
Wow.

3170
02:20:10,911 --> 02:20:12,440
I put that in your pussy.
Imagine of her.

3171
02:20:12,460 --> 02:20:14,260
No.
Imagine for breath,

3172
02:20:14,320 --> 02:20:17,440
smell that she's out pretty would suck
lik that.

3173
02:20:17,550 --> 02:20:19,570
And she goes,
this is like a ball gag.

3174
02:20:19,580 --> 02:20:22,820
This is like if you were going to like
practice strengthening your neck,

3175
02:20:22,850 --> 02:20:26,030
you'd bite down on that thing and attach
that rope to like a bungee cord.

3176
02:20:26,031 --> 02:20:30,410
Like the iron neck device you that thing
that you chew down and it strengthens

3177
02:20:30,411 --> 02:20:32,360
your next book.
Makes Sense?

3178
02:20:32,420 --> 02:20:35,760
Yeah.
This guy go back to that guy like,

3179
02:20:35,780 --> 02:20:37,970
come on Bro.
I don't care how much they're paying you

3180
02:20:37,971 --> 02:20:40,250
for this,
but he's the same one and his girlfriend

3181
02:20:40,251 --> 02:20:43,730
comes by and kisses him on the cheek and
leaves like he doesn't need to have time

3182
02:20:43,731 --> 02:20:47,450
to get a good kiss on the lips because
you too busy sucking on this robot Dick.

3183
02:20:50,700 --> 02:20:52,880
This thing is just cleaning out your
face.

3184
02:20:53,180 --> 02:20:55,760
How about you brush your teeth like a
fucking normal person?

3185
02:20:56,060 --> 02:20:58,370
Maybe have the newspaper open beside
you.

3186
02:20:58,610 --> 02:21:00,620
I just wonder if it's better.
I mean that dedication.

3187
02:21:00,770 --> 02:21:02,720
Here's my question.
Is it better to go to the car wash or

3188
02:21:02,721 --> 02:21:04,790
wash your car by hand?
Mm hmm.

3189
02:21:05,360 --> 02:21:06,920
Of course it's better to wash a car by
hand.

3190
02:21:06,921 --> 02:21:08,330
That's why hand washing costs more
money.

3191
02:21:08,870 --> 02:21:10,330
Well,
it depends what car washing,

3192
02:21:10,390 --> 02:21:11,690
what's better,
what's better,

3193
02:21:11,720 --> 02:21:15,050
what's better to give you your teeth,
the attention they deserve and go over

3194
02:21:15,051 --> 02:21:18,890
each one with a fine brush or suck the
robot Dick.

3195
02:21:18,920 --> 02:21:23,300
And he cleans your teeth out.
It should be just to save time or not.

3196
02:21:23,510 --> 02:21:24,470
I don't know.
It's a good question.

3197
02:21:24,471 --> 02:21:27,320
Yeah.
But how much time should you save and

3198
02:21:27,321 --> 02:21:29,720
how much time should you like?
I've been reading a lot about

3199
02:21:29,721 --> 02:21:30,350
meditation.

3200
02:21:30,350 --> 02:21:33,890
It's something I'm also considering I'm
getting get into during discipline.

3201
02:21:33,891 --> 02:21:37,480
December.
It's cool because the tank is not going

3202
02:21:37,481 --> 02:21:39,920
to be here for another couple of weeks.
So I gotta wait.

3203
02:21:40,940 --> 02:21:41,661
So,
uh,

3204
02:21:41,661 --> 02:21:43,670
I'm looking for other ways to expand the
mine.

3205
02:21:43,671 --> 02:21:46,550
So I'm thinking to do a little 10 minute
meditation session every day.

3206
02:21:47,240 --> 02:21:49,100
Every fucking day.
That's the thing.

3207
02:21:49,220 --> 02:21:52,220
Every day you got to do it every day it
got to commit yourself.

3208
02:21:52,250 --> 02:21:54,530
That's a long ass time.
Seems like it's not,

3209
02:21:54,980 --> 02:21:56,150
but it is.
You're like,

3210
02:21:56,151 --> 02:21:56,931
God,
I have 10 minutes.

3211
02:21:56,931 --> 02:21:58,040
I gotta go to work.
Nope.

3212
02:21:58,100 --> 02:22:00,800
You gotta do it.
Gotta do it sometime during the day.

3213
02:22:02,410 --> 02:22:04,580
A couple of those apps,
I think they help you like start streaks

3214
02:22:04,581 --> 02:22:08,060
and stuff so you can kind of game in a
little bit of help me get to your

3215
02:22:08,061 --> 02:22:10,680
fucking phone.
That's what they helped you look at.

3216
02:22:10,690 --> 02:22:14,000
Watch when nine o'clock rolls around,
get out of bed,

3217
02:22:14,040 --> 02:22:16,640
meditate,
get 10 minutes to hear about this new

3218
02:22:16,850 --> 02:22:17,390
dating app.

3219
02:22:17,390 --> 02:22:21,140
Caught Hater and a,
what you do is you put what you hate and

3220
02:22:21,141 --> 02:22:24,090
it matches you with people that hate is
named the same thing.

3221
02:22:24,220 --> 02:22:24,800
Oh,
perfect.

3222
02:22:24,800 --> 02:22:26,820
So it's like it,
it's interesting though.

3223
02:22:26,910 --> 02:22:29,100
It's interesting though because it's
backwards,

3224
02:22:29,130 --> 02:22:29,970
you know?
So it's like,

3225
02:22:29,971 --> 02:22:33,000
what if you only get matched?
Like what if I only got matched with

3226
02:22:33,001 --> 02:22:34,740
black women for some reason?
You know,

3227
02:22:35,150 --> 02:22:37,440
so all the thing,
it's so unnecessary.

3228
02:22:37,560 --> 02:22:39,900
Yeah.
It's,

3229
02:22:40,200 --> 02:22:42,570
I think people are probably getting laid
more now than ever before.

3230
02:22:42,571 --> 02:22:45,870
And I read this article where they were
putting the blame on stds,

3231
02:22:45,871 --> 02:22:48,780
the jumping stds on tinder and grindr.
Like,

3232
02:22:48,781 --> 02:22:49,291
no,
no,

3233
02:22:49,291 --> 02:22:49,801
no,
no,

3234
02:22:49,801 --> 02:22:51,090
no.
You can't.

3235
02:22:51,240 --> 02:22:52,200
No.
Okay.

3236
02:22:52,420 --> 02:22:54,810
Are you going to sue?
All the nightclubs were giving people

3237
02:22:54,811 --> 02:22:55,800
herpes.
No,

3238
02:22:55,920 --> 02:22:57,150
you're not.
You can't do that.

3239
02:22:57,200 --> 02:22:59,010
You,
these are the places where people meet.

3240
02:22:59,340 --> 02:23:03,060
They're not responsible for whether or
not someone's got herpes or Vd.

3241
02:23:03,060 --> 02:23:04,800
Stop it.
We'll make it too many people.

3242
02:23:04,830 --> 02:23:06,300
They're just trying to,
it's a money grab.

3243
02:23:06,540 --> 02:23:09,330
They realize that a lot of money in
tinder and someone's gonna start some

3244
02:23:09,331 --> 02:23:14,331
class action lawsuit and all these
people that got the herps or a real

3245
02:23:14,701 --> 02:23:18,210
strong stuff like it's like a real car.
You're legionnaires' disease broke out

3246
02:23:18,211 --> 02:23:19,590
at Disneyland.
Oh yeah.

3247
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:21,150
What?
And nine people got it.

3248
02:23:21,360 --> 02:23:25,380
What in the fuck legionnaire's disease
or is it,

3249
02:23:26,390 --> 02:23:30,150
what the fuck is that stuff doing around
like we gotta have some old,

3250
02:23:30,470 --> 02:23:32,220
you know,
because of like preservatives and food

3251
02:23:32,221 --> 02:23:34,140
or some shit.
Have some old diseases.

3252
02:23:34,141 --> 02:23:36,510
Make it come back.
What is legion like?

3253
02:23:36,511 --> 02:23:39,540
What is this symptom question?
I don't know.

3254
02:23:39,570 --> 02:23:41,790
Because there's another old sounds
terrible though.

3255
02:23:41,830 --> 02:23:43,380
Yeah,
it better be strong.

3256
02:23:43,440 --> 02:23:46,890
I better be able to fuck you up.
I'll get super pissed if they name like

3257
02:23:46,891 --> 02:23:47,700
some bitch ass.

3258
02:23:47,700 --> 02:23:50,820
Common Cold Legionnaires' disease,
a slight diarrhea.

3259
02:23:50,821 --> 02:23:52,530
It just makes you fart.
All Great.

3260
02:23:52,531 --> 02:23:54,210
And it doesn't spread from person to
person,

3261
02:23:54,211 --> 02:23:55,650
but through mist.
Yeah,

3262
02:23:55,670 --> 02:23:57,840
it's from the lottery.
Oh Man.

3263
02:23:57,841 --> 02:24:00,210
So it's from their water sprayers from
an air conditioner.

3264
02:24:00,211 --> 02:24:01,230
Yeah.
Oh my God.

3265
02:24:01,260 --> 02:24:02,210
Is that what it was from?
No,

3266
02:24:02,240 --> 02:24:03,600
it's from,
it could be from that.

3267
02:24:03,630 --> 02:24:05,960
I thought it was from outdoor mystery.
Wow,

3268
02:24:06,090 --> 02:24:07,490
that's crazy.
Yeah.

3269
02:24:07,590 --> 02:24:11,580
So it's somehow or another got on
outdoor mres and then got into how many

3270
02:24:11,581 --> 02:24:12,660
people?
Nine.

3271
02:24:12,930 --> 02:24:14,940
I think nine.
How many of those people were weak

3272
02:24:14,941 --> 02:24:16,160
pitches?
Yeah,

3273
02:24:16,170 --> 02:24:17,010
the kids.
I mean

3274
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:22,920
that's just a joke folks.
I'm sure they weren't.

3275
02:24:22,950 --> 02:24:24,550
They were wonderful people.
Uh,

3276
02:24:24,570 --> 02:24:28,290
elevated levels of Legion area bacteria.
Wow.

3277
02:24:28,320 --> 02:24:30,960
Causes Disneyland.
The shutdown cooling towers.

3278
02:24:31,560 --> 02:24:34,920
Notice shutdown cooling towers not shut
down,

3279
02:24:34,921 --> 02:24:35,754
bitch.
I'm sorry.

3280
02:24:35,760 --> 02:24:40,760
The show must go on.
15 people have when 15 people.

3281
02:24:41,190 --> 02:24:42,560
Holy Shit.
Now what is,

3282
02:24:42,630 --> 02:24:45,010
how dangerous is this stuff?
Find that out.

3283
02:24:45,600 --> 02:24:49,200
We removed our roof,
viewed our water quality testing data,

3284
02:24:49,201 --> 02:24:53,340
including testing performed by our third
party water quality maintenance

3285
02:24:53,341 --> 02:24:58,341
contractor and learn that to cooling
towers had elevated levels of legionella

3286
02:24:59,190 --> 02:25:01,140
bacteria,
Legionella,

3287
02:25:01,290 --> 02:25:03,600
Legionella,
legionella bacteria.

3288
02:25:03,601 --> 02:25:07,770
Fucking amen.
That's like some 28 days later.

3289
02:25:07,771 --> 02:25:08,604
Shit.
Right.

3290
02:25:09,570 --> 02:25:11,140
That's where it breaks out.
Like when is it going to,

3291
02:25:11,220 --> 02:25:13,890
when are we going to get a disease?
It turns people into crazy people.

3292
02:25:14,840 --> 02:25:19,830
Some we already have it right.
28 days later type shit though.

3293
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,710
I think you just get sick from it.
It sounds like maybe diarrhea or getting

3294
02:25:22,711 --> 02:25:23,650
the chills.
Fever.

3295
02:25:23,850 --> 02:25:26,980
It can get diluted with the antibiotics
sensitive people.

3296
02:25:27,780 --> 02:25:28,960
Hmm.
Well,

3297
02:25:28,961 --> 02:25:32,410
that was this week document or saying
that everybody's more gluten sensitive

3298
02:25:32,411 --> 02:25:33,550
than you realize.
Right?

3299
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:35,500
It's like,
it's like being allergic to a cat.

3300
02:25:35,840 --> 02:25:37,600
Everyone's allergic to cats,
but some people have.

3301
02:25:37,630 --> 02:25:39,010
Yeah,
everyone's allergic to it.

3302
02:25:39,080 --> 02:25:41,170
But about dogs.
Is everyone allergic to dog dander?

3303
02:25:41,171 --> 02:25:42,220
I think.
I think so.

3304
02:25:42,450 --> 02:25:43,290
I think,
but yeah,

3305
02:25:43,300 --> 02:25:45,550
definitely.
Your levels of it.

3306
02:25:46,570 --> 02:25:50,800
Severe often lethal form of lum oh,
of pneumonia.

3307
02:25:50,860 --> 02:25:52,570
Oh my God.
It's a severe,

3308
02:25:52,571 --> 02:25:56,650
often lethal form of pneumonia is caused
by the bacterium.

3309
02:25:56,680 --> 02:26:01,680
Legionella pneumonia fell into both
potable and non potable water.

3310
02:26:01,841 --> 02:26:05,590
Holy Shit.
That's not good.

3311
02:26:07,150 --> 02:26:09,100
Can you get it when it one happens on
water?

3312
02:26:09,101 --> 02:26:11,020
Because fuck,
I hope those people survive,

3313
02:26:11,021 --> 02:26:14,020
but those people are going to be okay.
Did the people from Disneyland get

3314
02:26:14,021 --> 02:26:15,600
treated and released.
Oh,

3315
02:26:15,890 --> 02:26:17,680
okay.
I need information.

3316
02:26:19,060 --> 02:26:22,330
This is a,
this is the dumb Bro News Network

3317
02:26:22,360 --> 02:26:23,890
checking in.
Hey Bro,

3318
02:26:23,950 --> 02:26:25,770
Delta,
Delta [inaudible] Bro.

3319
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:27,040
Right.
I heard a,

3320
02:26:27,041 --> 02:26:29,030
the fucking zombies are a Disneyland
Bro.

3321
02:26:29,031 --> 02:26:31,600
Just keep it on lockdown.
Doesn't want you to know bro.

3322
02:26:31,630 --> 02:26:35,950
They all over 50 to 52 sick.
50 2:00 PM now the age they were over

3323
02:26:35,951 --> 02:26:39,280
the age of 52 kids.
One was 94.

3324
02:26:39,430 --> 02:26:40,910
Oh Jesus.
What are you doing at Disney?

3325
02:26:41,050 --> 02:26:42,610
Well,
maybe their immune system is more

3326
02:26:42,611 --> 02:26:44,250
compromised when that old,
yeah,

3327
02:26:45,090 --> 02:26:47,590
the body can't fight it off.
Can't fight off the funk.

3328
02:26:48,100 --> 02:26:51,970
Fuck man.
52 that's like Dean del Ray's age.

3329
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:55,660
Isn't it weird that that's uh,
all of us are eventually,

3330
02:26:55,661 --> 02:26:57,400
if you keep going,
you're going to be a hundred.

3331
02:26:57,970 --> 02:27:00,850
Like if you live like one day you'll be,
if you survive,

3332
02:27:01,270 --> 02:27:02,590
you'll be,
who knows?

3333
02:27:02,591 --> 02:27:05,620
With medicine science,
you can easily survive.

3334
02:27:06,660 --> 02:27:07,270
Yeah.

3335
02:27:07,270 --> 02:27:10,180
Wouldn't put all my money and you make
it a hundred be 77.

3336
02:27:10,710 --> 02:27:12,520
But if you did,
I mean,

3337
02:27:12,521 --> 02:27:13,390
did you,
you never know though.

3338
02:27:13,400 --> 02:27:13,931
Dude,
I'm telling you.

3339
02:27:13,931 --> 02:27:16,480
We're so close to like innovation,
breakthroughs,

3340
02:27:16,510 --> 02:27:18,340
medical breakthroughs.
What's this?

3341
02:27:18,430 --> 02:27:21,940
What do you got?
55 cases were found in Orange County

3342
02:27:21,941 --> 02:27:24,050
last year and they don't know why.
God,

3343
02:27:24,700 --> 02:27:27,870
Orange County's recorded more than 55
cases of the disease is here and the

3344
02:27:27,871 --> 02:27:29,890
seen the number of cases jump in recent
years,

3345
02:27:30,130 --> 02:27:33,490
similar upward trend has been seen
naturally and elsewhere in southern

3346
02:27:33,491 --> 02:27:36,550
California according to the healthcare
agency though.

3347
02:27:36,551 --> 02:27:40,870
What's causing that is unclear.
Don Don Don to coop the two towers ever

3348
02:27:40,871 --> 02:27:44,410
shut down where a in the backstage area
more than a hundred feet from the

3349
02:27:44,411 --> 02:27:45,620
nearest people.
Huh?

3350
02:27:45,910 --> 02:27:47,470
Oh,
that's why only a few people got it,

3351
02:27:47,471 --> 02:27:48,304
Huh?
Yeah.

3352
02:27:48,370 --> 02:27:50,750
Wow.
Maybe that week we can be in system,

3353
02:27:50,760 --> 02:27:53,830
but maybe just some,
Tommy didn't clean the thing.

3354
02:27:53,830 --> 02:27:57,040
He was supposed to clean because he was
lazy cause he wanted to put on as furry

3355
02:27:57,041 --> 02:27:58,680
outfit and go,
Fuck Huh.

3356
02:27:59,070 --> 02:28:01,630
Go on a furry fuck fest.
Maybe that's what happened.

3357
02:28:01,930 --> 02:28:03,230
How many furries working distantly
lands?

3358
02:28:03,280 --> 02:28:04,150
Probably all of them,
right?

3359
02:28:04,151 --> 02:28:05,320
Yeah.
If you are a furry,

3360
02:28:05,321 --> 02:28:08,170
that'd be a dream job match.
You could walk around pretending to be

3361
02:28:08,171 --> 02:28:10,180
goofy.
Go to goofy's kitchen and wave at the

3362
02:28:10,181 --> 02:28:13,930
kids is on top of her showing up.
What's that thing for?

3363
02:28:13,931 --> 02:28:16,990
Security is on top of furry showing up
on on the parking lot and want to get

3364
02:28:16,991 --> 02:28:20,480
them Outta here.
You'd have to use a um,

3365
02:28:20,750 --> 02:28:22,070
incognito social media

3366
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:23,900
account,
which all the firies do anyway that I've

3367
02:28:23,960 --> 02:28:26,000
come across over the last three days of
research.

3368
02:28:27,350 --> 02:28:30,290
All Furry group especially,
they have to be super careful,

3369
02:28:31,070 --> 02:28:33,410
especially the art fairs.
That'd be super careful.

3370
02:28:33,860 --> 02:28:35,500
Well,
what's the difference between off like

3371
02:28:35,550 --> 02:28:38,630
all right there all right people to
trump supporters that are fairies,

3372
02:28:39,560 --> 02:28:44,180
fairies and maybe fairies to brownies.
Brownies are,

3373
02:28:44,240 --> 02:28:45,073
yeah,
they're right up there.

3374
02:28:45,080 --> 02:28:48,380
I like bronies now I can get down some
brown brown.

3375
02:28:48,381 --> 02:28:49,670
I don't know if that's real.
By the way,

3376
02:28:49,671 --> 02:28:51,650
if you're,
if you're an ot furry and you're mad at

3377
02:28:51,651 --> 02:28:52,341
me,
now that's not,

3378
02:28:52,341 --> 02:28:53,930
I don't know if it's real.
I don't know.

3379
02:28:53,931 --> 02:28:55,910
But one guy was calling himself for
Nazi.

3380
02:28:57,140 --> 02:29:00,130
Yeah,
that sounds like a troll to me when

3381
02:29:00,170 --> 02:29:02,540
maybe,
but isn't that what a lot of this stuff

3382
02:29:02,541 --> 02:29:06,770
is being silly?
What we're supposed to pretend that

3383
02:29:06,771 --> 02:29:08,630
that's not like the spirit of the
Internet sometimes.

3384
02:29:08,870 --> 02:29:10,610
That's what got me so mad about that
whole pepe,

3385
02:29:10,611 --> 02:29:11,930
the frog stuff.
It's like,

3386
02:29:11,931 --> 02:29:14,330
listen,
this spirit of the Internet is in

3387
02:29:14,331 --> 02:29:16,250
fucking with people.
It has been forever.

3388
02:29:16,340 --> 02:29:18,290
People are bored.
They're at work.

3389
02:29:18,380 --> 02:29:21,620
They come up with hilarious memes and
some of them are really fucked up.

3390
02:29:21,800 --> 02:29:25,150
Does that mean that guy's a real Nazi or
does it mean he's just an asshole who's

3391
02:29:25,190 --> 02:29:27,950
bored at work and he's mad at everybody?
It might be that,

3392
02:29:28,760 --> 02:29:30,980
you know,
I don't know how many of them are like

3393
02:29:30,981 --> 02:29:34,370
real Nazis and how might have been.
We're just people fucking around.

3394
02:29:35,180 --> 02:29:36,320
That's like the Internet,
right?

3395
02:29:36,350 --> 02:29:39,140
The Internet is all right.
Like so much of the Internet is people

3396
02:29:39,141 --> 02:29:41,090
fucking around.
It's so hard to tell what's going on in

3397
02:29:41,091 --> 02:29:44,540
any given moment.
You know,

3398
02:29:44,541 --> 02:29:46,420
like this flat earth thing.
I,

3399
02:29:46,430 --> 02:29:48,180
that's the great thing about it,
but doesn't change.

3400
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,010
It can't change.
Do you think it'll change?

3401
02:29:52,011 --> 02:29:55,910
Do you think that really it'll get to a
point where they'll have so much control

3402
02:29:55,911 --> 02:29:58,520
over the Internet that there'll be able
to stop content like that.

3403
02:29:58,521 --> 02:30:03,521
Like there'll be a closed down like
message boards or a social media where

3404
02:30:03,621 --> 02:30:05,240
people are allowed to talk about stuff
like that.

3405
02:30:05,420 --> 02:30:07,540
They do it in every other country.
All must,

3406
02:30:07,580 --> 02:30:08,413
you know,
they just,

3407
02:30:08,540 --> 02:30:11,150
the main reason they want it is because
too many,

3408
02:30:11,630 --> 02:30:15,890
I mean net netflix takes up like 75% of
the bandwidth right now.

3409
02:30:15,990 --> 02:30:16,761
Does it really?
Yeah.

3410
02:30:16,761 --> 02:30:20,060
It's like something crazy where all
these videos and we're all,

3411
02:30:20,080 --> 02:30:21,290
we're,
it's going to get worse.

3412
02:30:21,291 --> 02:30:22,790
Four K Eight K,
12 gay.

3413
02:30:23,030 --> 02:30:25,670
So they want to have control of,
you know,

3414
02:30:25,760 --> 02:30:28,290
if you're gonna use video or if you
want,

3415
02:30:28,310 --> 02:30:31,190
they want to like pretty much it's,
that's what I think they're saying

3416
02:30:31,191 --> 02:30:31,420
there.

3417
02:30:31,420 --> 02:30:33,790
Well,
I kind of get it from their perspective.

3418
02:30:33,791 --> 02:30:37,600
If say they have a limited amount of
bandwidth and then the one application,

3419
02:30:37,601 --> 02:30:40,480
like Netflix is using up most of their
bandwidth of paying the same amount of

3420
02:30:40,481 --> 02:30:41,314
money.
Right.

3421
02:30:41,650 --> 02:30:44,320
I don't know if that's the case though.
That's the question I'm not sure about

3422
02:30:44,321 --> 02:30:46,150
is is there a limited amount of
bandwidth?

3423
02:30:46,151 --> 02:30:49,780
It seems like there's always been an
infinite amount of bandwidth,

3424
02:30:49,800 --> 02:30:52,390
right?
Why would there ever be true socialist

3425
02:30:53,670 --> 02:30:56,020
Commie?
Just wondering you bad for business.

3426
02:30:56,680 --> 02:30:59,470
I get the pipe.
The pipes might get clogged,

3427
02:30:59,471 --> 02:31:01,750
which could be a thing.
It's all happening at once.

3428
02:31:01,960 --> 02:31:04,630
You would really freak me the fuck out.
When I found out there's a real pipe,

3429
02:31:05,080 --> 02:31:06,770
it goes across the bottom of the ocean.
I went,

3430
02:31:06,850 --> 02:31:07,683
wait,
what?

3431
02:31:07,930 --> 02:31:10,660
So if you send an email from somebody
from Australia,

3432
02:31:10,661 --> 02:31:15,661
there's a God damn pipe as someone laid
across the flat ocean of the flat earth

3433
02:31:16,090 --> 02:31:17,830
all the way to the other side,
if that,

3434
02:31:17,980 --> 02:31:20,280
those people have to be in on the flat
earth conspiracy as well.

3435
02:31:20,310 --> 02:31:23,220
By the way,
why does it just go by satellite?

3436
02:31:23,221 --> 02:31:25,080
Why does it have to go through this pipe
anyways?

3437
02:31:25,380 --> 02:31:27,090
I don't know.
It might not be a pipe to Australia,

3438
02:31:27,300 --> 02:31:29,670
but it's definitely a pipe to Japan.
I believe.

3439
02:31:29,930 --> 02:31:33,060
Trans Atlantic Communications,
cable and transatlantic communications

3440
02:31:33,061 --> 02:31:35,250
cable,
transatlantic communications cables,

3441
02:31:35,251 --> 02:31:36,420
a submarine,
Whoa.

3442
02:31:36,480 --> 02:31:39,540
Submarine Communications cable
connecting one side of the Atlantic

3443
02:31:39,540 --> 02:31:41,940
Ocean to the other.
After mid century,

3444
02:31:42,150 --> 02:31:45,720
coaxial cable came into use with
amplifiers late in the century,

3445
02:31:45,721 --> 02:31:47,750
used for optical fiber,
uh,

3446
02:31:47,880 --> 02:31:52,020
and most now use optical amplifiers.
So that's only one cable.

3447
02:31:52,021 --> 02:31:52,854
It's only one

3448
02:31:52,940 --> 02:31:54,040
probably really big.
And their mouths,

3449
02:31:54,210 --> 02:31:56,270
they can't be just one.
But this just made me think of something

3450
02:31:56,271 --> 02:31:58,580
else I wanted to show you that I just
found the other day that's kind of

3451
02:31:58,581 --> 02:32:00,140
scary.
That has to do with fiber optics

3452
02:32:00,290 --> 02:32:01,123
done.
Done.

3453
02:32:02,070 --> 02:32:04,800
I gotta get to it,
but it's time for another episode of

3454
02:32:04,801 --> 02:32:06,780
Jamie Vernon scares the world.

3455
02:32:07,270 --> 02:32:12,070
Me a link that showed that uh,
people can hide a microphone.

3456
02:32:12,280 --> 02:32:15,220
I don't know how big and how well it can
listen inside of an ethernet cable.

3457
02:32:15,760 --> 02:32:16,690
Oh Geez.
And they were like,

3458
02:32:16,691 --> 02:32:18,670
check all your cables cause you never
know what could happen.

3459
02:32:18,730 --> 02:32:23,080
And then so I started looking through
the tweets of that and it showed there

3460
02:32:23,081 --> 02:32:26,740
was a link to a,
a company that made a fiber cable.

3461
02:32:27,160 --> 02:32:30,490
And the description of what the fiber
cable could do is that it could listen

3462
02:32:31,030 --> 02:32:32,980
the entire length of the cable.

3463
02:32:34,360 --> 02:32:35,160
And

3464
02:32:35,160 --> 02:32:38,610
it was sort of saying it was just to be
able to listen for like a water

3465
02:32:38,611 --> 02:32:40,500
underground,
like water pipes that are leaking and

3466
02:32:40,860 --> 02:32:43,950
things like that.
But it doesn't say the limit of what it

3467
02:32:43,951 --> 02:32:48,100
can here and where it's being used,
which is uh,

3468
02:32:48,290 --> 02:32:48,950
alarming.

3469
02:32:48,950 --> 02:32:52,190
Could you imagine if it turned out that
everything,

3470
02:32:52,220 --> 02:32:56,480
every wire in everyone's house is
secretly a microphone and the government

3471
02:32:56,660 --> 02:33:00,260
has been years ahead with this data and
tuning into everything you've said at

3472
02:33:00,261 --> 02:33:01,230
every moment.
All,

3473
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:04,680
all your life.
So here's the microphone inside of the

3474
02:33:05,710 --> 02:33:06,920
same,
what?

3475
02:33:07,550 --> 02:33:11,330
That little tiny thing is a microphone.
Oh my God.

3476
02:33:11,900 --> 02:33:14,000
And then where's your God now?
Whoa.

3477
02:33:14,990 --> 02:33:16,130
Serious.
Leat kids.

3478
02:33:16,490 --> 02:33:18,080
I bet he spells it.
L three,

3479
02:33:18,081 --> 02:33:20,270
three T.
I don't know if I'll be able to find

3480
02:33:20,271 --> 02:33:20,571
her.
Three.

3481
02:33:20,571 --> 02:33:21,850
Seven is three,
three,

3482
02:33:21,860 --> 02:33:22,693
seven

3483
02:33:22,890 --> 02:33:24,540
l seven three,
three,

3484
02:33:24,541 --> 02:33:26,610
one.
Sorry,

3485
02:33:28,110 --> 02:33:29,400
I can't,
I don't know if I'm going to go to find

3486
02:33:29,401 --> 02:33:31,200
this.
I was like taking a shit while I was

3487
02:33:31,201 --> 02:33:33,690
looking through this deep tweet.
There's like 5,000 things in here now.

3488
02:33:33,691 --> 02:33:35,640
So,
but it's a scary thing.

3489
02:33:35,641 --> 02:33:38,040
And the fiber,
I didn't really know you could even hear

3490
02:33:38,041 --> 02:33:41,130
audio through fiber that way.
I know that it's used,

3491
02:33:41,880 --> 02:33:42,630
um,
like uh,

3492
02:33:42,630 --> 02:33:44,940
the light cable you can use in the back
of your any box.

3493
02:33:44,941 --> 02:33:48,270
That little red light that's always on
is looking for a fiber audio cable,

3494
02:33:48,271 --> 02:33:49,440
which is the best,
but

3495
02:33:49,620 --> 02:33:51,060
that's how it,
Mike's Wick told me once,

3496
02:33:51,120 --> 02:33:56,120
Mike Swick was working for the United
States government in Russia and they had

3497
02:33:56,371 --> 02:33:59,160
like a Russian ambassador,
a Russian embassy building,

3498
02:33:59,670 --> 02:34:01,560
you know,
American US embassy building in Russia.

3499
02:34:01,920 --> 02:34:06,810
And they had developed these devices
that they found in the walls of the

3500
02:34:06,811 --> 02:34:11,811
building that were powered by the
movement of the building.

3501
02:34:12,750 --> 02:34:15,270
Like cause the move,
because it's a skyscraper would have a

3502
02:34:15,271 --> 02:34:18,130
certain mass sway through the wind and
they had figured

3503
02:34:18,130 --> 02:34:22,960
out to how to make a device that didn't
require any sort of additional power

3504
02:34:22,961 --> 02:34:24,880
source other than the movement of the
building.

3505
02:34:24,900 --> 02:34:26,440
Right.
And it could transmit sound.

3506
02:34:26,441 --> 02:34:28,610
They're like,
this stuff is so far ahead of anything

3507
02:34:28,690 --> 02:34:32,500
we knew even existed and they were using
this in the building spine people.

3508
02:34:32,890 --> 02:34:37,890
Mike Swick told me about that in like
2002 and it happened to him way before

3509
02:34:39,341 --> 02:34:42,250
that,
so we might be,

3510
02:34:42,520 --> 02:34:44,620
you know who the fuck knows what they
can,

3511
02:34:44,650 --> 02:34:48,640
I mean John Edward Snowden does might be
the reason why they kept that guy

3512
02:34:48,641 --> 02:34:53,380
running like because they want to
discourage anybody coming out.

3513
02:34:53,381 --> 02:34:56,380
Now,
at any moment we're going to find out

3514
02:34:56,530 --> 02:34:59,050
that all of our phones are on 24 hours a
day.

3515
02:34:59,051 --> 02:35:01,780
Whether they're at of batteries are not
that there's a certain amount of battery

3516
02:35:01,781 --> 02:35:03,640
life.
I think your phone retains and the

3517
02:35:03,641 --> 02:35:04,570
government could listen.

3518
02:35:04,840 --> 02:35:07,960
They know where you are.
The GPS tracker is tracking your phone,

3519
02:35:07,961 --> 02:35:10,390
whether it's on or off everywhere you
go.

3520
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:13,540
No,
a lot of those phones actually do work

3521
02:35:13,780 --> 02:35:16,420
with gps when the phone is on airplane
mode.

3522
02:35:16,750 --> 02:35:18,430
Oh yeah.
Well it's just,

3523
02:35:18,460 --> 02:35:19,390
yeah,
yeah.

3524
02:35:19,391 --> 02:35:23,650
There's a gps chip in your phone.
That's why find your phone works.

3525
02:35:24,070 --> 02:35:26,040
Like you can go on apple,
find your phone.

3526
02:35:26,060 --> 02:35:27,160
Hey,
my phone's in the Bronx.

3527
02:35:27,170 --> 02:35:29,050
Hey leave it there.
Don't get shot.

3528
02:35:29,110 --> 02:35:30,820
But listen,
there's,

3529
02:35:31,180 --> 02:35:35,590
that's how they can do that.
They can find your Jamie once they take

3530
02:35:35,591 --> 02:35:36,424
your eyes,
man,

3531
02:35:37,020 --> 02:35:39,590
if they give you those robot eyes,
it's in the air pod.

3532
02:35:39,591 --> 02:35:42,400
That's in the Apple Watch too.
It's in all your apple computers.

3533
02:35:42,710 --> 02:35:44,500
Lots everywhere.
Yeah.

3534
02:35:44,740 --> 02:35:46,990
How's that possible?
Because she lives shit.

3535
02:35:47,020 --> 02:35:48,400
Fuck.
I like it.

3536
02:35:48,490 --> 02:35:50,650
What if I try to lose me?
So I'll tell you what.

3537
02:35:50,651 --> 02:35:54,130
I'm digging these airpods I've been
using it a lot like fucking awesome.

3538
02:35:54,580 --> 02:35:56,260
God,
I was so skeptical.

3539
02:35:56,470 --> 02:35:58,720
Look,
I keep with me all the time too.

3540
02:35:58,721 --> 02:36:01,270
Now.
My favorite thing about them is that the

3541
02:36:01,271 --> 02:36:04,390
case that,
cause that's one thing I always had with

3542
02:36:04,391 --> 02:36:05,770
Bluetooth headphones.
I always like,

3543
02:36:05,771 --> 02:36:07,240
fuck,
I forgot to charge my head and look at

3544
02:36:07,241 --> 02:36:08,710
this.
[inaudible] welcome to the future

3545
02:36:08,711 --> 02:36:13,270
pitches
and I stick them in Miami and worry

3546
02:36:13,271 --> 02:36:14,740
about them falling out.
They don't really fall out.

3547
02:36:14,770 --> 02:36:16,510
They're hard to fall out.
I had to like hit it.

3548
02:36:16,870 --> 02:36:20,930
I made them fall out of the gym when I
was doing Chin ups because my shoulder's

3549
02:36:20,950 --> 02:36:24,130
touched my ears and I made him fall out.
And when one goes out,

3550
02:36:24,160 --> 02:36:25,470
the other one stops.
Yeah.

3551
02:36:25,620 --> 02:36:27,850
Which is crazy.
If you have the Apple Watch,

3552
02:36:28,410 --> 02:36:29,230
which much?
No.

3553
02:36:29,230 --> 02:36:32,050
But then you don't need your iphone for
music too much.

3554
02:36:32,051 --> 02:36:34,330
You're using your phone.
Got To draw lines.

3555
02:36:34,900 --> 02:36:37,960
It's a better for jogging so you don't
have your phone in your pocket when

3556
02:36:37,961 --> 02:36:38,800
you're listening to music.

3557
02:36:39,040 --> 02:36:41,710
I have a fanny pack that is a neoprene
waistband.

3558
02:36:41,830 --> 02:36:44,530
My phone sits in there perfectly.
Car Keys.

3559
02:36:44,740 --> 02:36:45,640
It's extra weight,
Bro.

3560
02:36:45,730 --> 02:36:47,200
Not No problem.
I don't mind.

3561
02:36:47,920 --> 02:36:50,830
I'm stuck.
I'm running with my dog.

3562
02:36:50,831 --> 02:36:52,640
I'm not shaving any seconds.
Do a lot of calling,

3563
02:36:53,370 --> 02:36:57,270
trying to get him out of the bushes.
My dog fucking loves it now.

3564
02:36:57,271 --> 02:36:59,190
He still hates going in the car,
but uh,

3565
02:36:59,200 --> 02:37:01,000
he's more reluctant.
He's less reluctant.

3566
02:37:01,001 --> 02:37:03,130
He gets right up to the car cause he
knows we're going to go run and he loves

3567
02:37:03,131 --> 02:37:04,990
running.
And then when we come back,

3568
02:37:05,020 --> 02:37:07,000
a lot of times I give him a bath too.
Oh,

3569
02:37:07,001 --> 02:37:09,130
he loves that leash.
No leash,

3570
02:37:09,131 --> 02:37:11,200
man.
He's a really good,

3571
02:37:11,320 --> 02:37:13,000
he really listens.
He'll wake me,

3572
02:37:13,030 --> 02:37:16,270
obviously he's
some fucking goofball

3573
02:37:16,300 --> 02:37:20,720
online.
I posted a video and I was like a fool.

3574
02:37:20,721 --> 02:37:22,280
I read through some of the comments.
One of them said,

3575
02:37:22,460 --> 02:37:24,740
don't let him get ahead of you bro.
You're the alpha.

3576
02:37:25,450 --> 02:37:26,271
And I'm like,
look,

3577
02:37:26,271 --> 02:37:29,990
I hope you're either joking around,
maybe trolled me.

3578
02:37:29,991 --> 02:37:32,270
You might've told me,
but you might be just a dummy.

3579
02:37:32,660 --> 02:37:34,220
I'm thinking you probably more of a
dummy.

3580
02:37:34,300 --> 02:37:36,260
No,
I think your dog ahead of you when you

3581
02:37:36,261 --> 02:37:38,240
walk on a leash,
stupid or otherwise,

3582
02:37:38,270 --> 02:37:39,890
you're not.
Your dog's walking you.

3583
02:37:39,891 --> 02:37:43,280
You dumb cunt.
You know you're always going to be in

3584
02:37:43,281 --> 02:37:45,020
the back.
See the dogs in front.

3585
02:37:45,050 --> 02:37:46,940
That's the other leash.
That's where you're wrong,

3586
02:37:46,941 --> 02:37:48,800
Joe.
It has to walk next to you.

3587
02:37:49,420 --> 02:37:52,090
I mean,
cause that's what Cesar Milan tells

3588
02:37:52,100 --> 02:37:52,911
people.
I don't know.

3589
02:37:52,911 --> 02:37:53,744
Shit.

3590
02:37:56,930 --> 02:37:59,210
He doesn't run.
He's not running with his dog.

3591
02:37:59,240 --> 02:38:01,190
I run with my dog.
My top totally listens to me.

3592
02:38:01,490 --> 02:38:03,200
And when he gets to far goals,
stop dude.

3593
02:38:03,440 --> 02:38:05,420
And he stops like he's smart.
I go,

3594
02:38:05,421 --> 02:38:06,141
come on back,
buddy.

3595
02:38:06,141 --> 02:38:08,420
I'm going to take a breather.
Like he'll come back and hang out with

3596
02:38:08,421 --> 02:38:10,610
me like he's,
I don't let them off the leash.

3597
02:38:10,680 --> 02:38:13,820
I liked the fact that he's,
he likes to be free.

3598
02:38:14,120 --> 02:38:16,150
He likes to run around.
I want them to run around,

3599
02:38:16,190 --> 02:38:17,470
let them have a good,
he's a sweet dog.

3600
02:38:17,471 --> 02:38:19,590
He's not going to be mean to anybody.
You know,

3601
02:38:19,730 --> 02:38:21,310
my,
my new dog is,

3602
02:38:21,350 --> 02:38:24,650
doesn't know how to use a leash and it's
been trained to not use a leash,

3603
02:38:24,680 --> 02:38:28,640
but I don't trust it so much because
it's like one car honking his horn or

3604
02:38:28,641 --> 02:38:31,400
something and he freaks out and runs
into the traffic or something.

3605
02:38:31,640 --> 02:38:32,980
Yeah.
When his cars,

3606
02:38:32,990 --> 02:38:35,100
I always have him on a leash.
Anytime there's cars that had him on a

3607
02:38:35,101 --> 02:38:37,130
leash,
but when I get out of the car and we go

3608
02:38:37,131 --> 02:38:38,390
off into the trails,
you know,

3609
02:38:38,391 --> 02:38:39,440
I mean,
if people see him,

3610
02:38:39,441 --> 02:38:41,770
he's like the nicest dog ever.
Anybody meets him.

3611
02:38:41,771 --> 02:38:42,231
I was like,
oh,

3612
02:38:42,231 --> 02:38:43,280
he's so sweet.
You know,

3613
02:38:43,281 --> 02:38:46,280
so it's not like you have to worry about
it being dangerous.

3614
02:38:47,270 --> 02:38:48,410
He just likes to run around,
man.

3615
02:38:48,710 --> 02:38:51,020
It's fun to watch.
It's like you're watching like a little

3616
02:38:51,080 --> 02:38:52,130
dog,
little kid.

3617
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:54,500
Why don't you bring him here so we can
look at him?

3618
02:38:54,650 --> 02:38:55,700
Well,
because he's at home.

3619
02:38:56,040 --> 02:38:57,530
I was like,
Sabine is yard man.

3620
02:38:57,630 --> 02:39:00,050
Go in the pool and swam.
He swims whenever he wants too.

3621
02:39:00,170 --> 02:39:02,660
That'd be funny if you were the new
comic that always brings his dog

3622
02:39:02,661 --> 02:39:04,910
everywhere.
But you Brian Golden retriever.

3623
02:39:05,250 --> 02:39:07,250
He's 75 pound dog everywhere.

3624
02:39:08,320 --> 02:39:10,790
Tales knocking people's drinks or ass
hall.

3625
02:39:11,150 --> 02:39:13,910
Can you fucking dog out of here man
tales.

3626
02:39:14,090 --> 02:39:16,490
So many people are so stupid with their
dogs.

3627
02:39:16,640 --> 02:39:20,010
Like their dog is like a baby.
Like they can't leave it alone anywhere.

3628
02:39:20,030 --> 02:39:22,720
Eliza can't leave it anywhere.
No,

3629
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,250
Eliza's I've seen her without the dog
occasionally.

3630
02:39:25,350 --> 02:39:27,500
Yeah,
he holds it.

3631
02:39:27,650 --> 02:39:30,170
The husband,
he clings onto that thing.

3632
02:39:30,171 --> 02:39:32,180
She's a sweet dog.
She's definitely a super,

3633
02:39:32,181 --> 02:39:34,580
super loved and friendly dog.
I Love Blanche.

3634
02:39:35,030 --> 02:39:35,863
Yeah,
she's awesome.

3635
02:39:36,200 --> 02:39:37,130
I love dogs,
man.

3636
02:39:37,190 --> 02:39:38,240
You know what I mean?
That's another,

3637
02:39:38,241 --> 02:39:40,970
um,
a good argument for not living in the

3638
02:39:40,971 --> 02:39:42,860
city.
Live somewhere where your dog can be

3639
02:39:42,861 --> 02:39:44,000
free,
you know,

3640
02:39:44,030 --> 02:39:46,550
live somewhere.
We can go out the back yard and throw a

3641
02:39:46,551 --> 02:39:48,140
Frisbee for your dog,
you know,

3642
02:39:48,141 --> 02:39:50,240
go go on hikes,
goddammit.

3643
02:39:50,270 --> 02:39:55,270
Dumpy stuck in that red and white horror
show of tail lights and headlight

3644
02:39:57,021 --> 02:39:59,150
traffic.
Fuck man.

3645
02:40:00,560 --> 02:40:02,480
Yeah.
What do you mean?

3646
02:40:02,481 --> 02:40:05,420
What's that going to be like in 20 years
and the skywalk?

3647
02:40:05,421 --> 02:40:09,110
Shouldn't we be planning for that?
You know that's just going to be in the

3648
02:40:09,111 --> 02:40:11,150
sky.
It's just going to be like 20 feet up.

3649
02:40:11,390 --> 02:40:12,890
You might've been right with Santa
Barbara.

3650
02:40:13,050 --> 02:40:14,010
You know why I think you might've

3651
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:17,580
been right because Santa Barbara's only
an hour away so he'd go up there.

3652
02:40:18,240 --> 02:40:20,400
It's an hour away.
Important Shit.

3653
02:40:20,401 --> 02:40:22,470
We could always come back to drive us
in.

3654
02:40:22,680 --> 02:40:24,240
Is that how that works then?
Yeah,

3655
02:40:24,270 --> 02:40:26,820
just has slightly honestly drives us in.
Oh,

3656
02:40:26,821 --> 02:40:27,690
one of them.
Jammies.

3657
02:40:27,691 --> 02:40:28,231
Yeah.
Yeah.

3658
02:40:28,231 --> 02:40:31,410
Is that going to happen?
I think he's just doing la though.

3659
02:40:31,411 --> 02:40:32,790
He's probably not going to do the Santa
Barbara.

3660
02:40:33,260 --> 02:40:34,230
Same County.
Right.

3661
02:40:34,260 --> 02:40:36,090
He's probably going to go right up to
San Francisco.

3662
02:40:36,091 --> 02:40:39,870
Have you heard of Tesla loop in Los
Angeles where you can just rent a,

3663
02:40:39,871 --> 02:40:42,150
it's like Uber.
They said you have to go to San Diego,

3664
02:40:42,270 --> 02:40:45,690
you rent a,
somebody will drive a tesla for you and

3665
02:40:46,170 --> 02:40:48,960
it's pretty cheap.
Like $49 down to San Diego and you just

3666
02:40:48,961 --> 02:40:52,950
ride in a tesla for 49 bucks.
Pretty cheap uber type thing.

3667
02:40:52,951 --> 02:40:54,750
I saw them.
I want to got to the airport last time I

3668
02:40:54,751 --> 02:40:55,350
was there.
Yeah.

3669
02:40:55,350 --> 02:40:58,890
Testing nine bucks.
The San Diego just talking about that

3670
02:40:58,891 --> 02:41:00,430
seems super cheap.
Yeah.

3671
02:41:00,750 --> 02:41:02,310
How are they going to make money?
Test a little loop.

3672
02:41:02,340 --> 02:41:06,030
That's the thing is that new sports car,
they came out with that new roadster

3673
02:41:06,060 --> 02:41:10,770
goes 600 miles without a recharge.
Now you're talking now I'm interested.

3674
02:41:10,890 --> 02:41:13,290
Now I'm listening.
600 miles.

3675
02:41:13,291 --> 02:41:14,124
Huh?
Huh?

3676
02:41:14,420 --> 02:41:17,800
Did he just not a top speed but
fuck.

3677
02:41:17,880 --> 02:41:21,120
Just go wherever you want to go.
They go to Los Angeles,

3678
02:41:21,121 --> 02:41:22,200
San Diego,
Orange County,

3679
02:41:22,201 --> 02:41:23,970
palm springs.
That's crazy.

3680
02:41:24,350 --> 02:41:26,200
Yeah,
that's amazing.

3681
02:41:26,230 --> 02:41:29,170
It's at $29 that's amazing.
Smart.

3682
02:41:29,910 --> 02:41:32,130
It's smart.
It's free advertising for the cars.

3683
02:41:32,131 --> 02:41:33,360
People get in and they're like,
Holy Shit,

3684
02:41:33,361 --> 02:41:35,550
this thing is nice.
And then you see that guy giant

3685
02:41:35,551 --> 02:41:36,600
dashboard and you go,
Whoa,

3686
02:41:36,601 --> 02:41:38,590
you got an ipad and you're down.
What is that?

3687
02:41:38,720 --> 02:41:40,640
Is it like a airplane seat?
Your bias?

3688
02:41:40,650 --> 02:41:42,030
You could be sitting with other people.
Yeah.

3689
02:41:42,340 --> 02:41:45,750
Yeah.
I mean it's $39 just by the seat next to

3690
02:41:45,830 --> 02:41:50,430
have someone as far a bus that goes
every day now from San Francisco to la,

3691
02:41:50,431 --> 02:41:53,580
that's like a overnight sleeping bus.
Were you sleeping a pod and they have

3692
02:41:53,581 --> 02:41:54,480
like really?
Yeah,

3693
02:41:54,840 --> 02:41:56,910
that's not,
that's obviously not the fastest way to

3694
02:41:56,911 --> 02:41:59,070
do it,
but if you need to go overnight and you

3695
02:41:59,080 --> 02:42:02,700
kind have that time to rest was a driver
stays away.

3696
02:42:02,790 --> 02:42:03,720
Okay.
That's the scary,

3697
02:42:03,721 --> 02:42:06,810
I mean I hope the same with the pilot,
but a driver sleeping,

3698
02:42:07,080 --> 02:42:10,280
I don't know if it's a pilot,
it's all shot on auto pilot.

3699
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:13,290
Pilot can adjust,
but maybe those tests of buses,

3700
02:42:13,380 --> 02:42:15,510
maybe a tussle bus like when them big
ass,

3701
02:42:15,840 --> 02:42:17,940
those,
those big giant trucks that he's making

3702
02:42:17,941 --> 02:42:21,810
now put pods in the back of the truck.
There's only three or 500 miles though,

3703
02:42:21,811 --> 02:42:22,830
right?
So far?

3704
02:42:22,831 --> 02:42:25,520
I think 500 miles Max one I think so you
go,

3705
02:42:25,530 --> 02:42:27,780
uh,
you stop and San Luis Obispo.

3706
02:42:27,870 --> 02:42:31,230
I start carrying battery charge.
How long they have to charge for.

3707
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:36,660
What is the distance in miles from La to
San Francisco?

3708
02:42:36,690 --> 02:42:39,680
If you had to guess?
800 and I don't know.

3709
02:42:39,750 --> 02:42:41,040
No,
no,

3710
02:42:41,041 --> 02:42:41,521
no,
no,

3711
02:42:41,521 --> 02:42:42,840
not nearly,
not nearly.

3712
02:42:42,900 --> 02:42:47,900
I would say probably in the 400 it's
like 420470470 you think?

3713
02:42:49,170 --> 02:42:49,831
Yeah.
Okay.

3714
02:42:49,831 --> 02:42:50,810
I've never done it.
Okay.

3715
02:42:50,910 --> 02:42:52,720
You say 800?
I say for 25.

3716
02:42:52,721 --> 02:42:55,170
600 you say for 75 you say 600.
Okay.

3717
02:42:55,290 --> 02:42:56,370
That's good.
That's good bet.

3718
02:42:57,030 --> 02:42:58,860
I don't think it's right though.
I think it's way less.

3719
02:42:59,330 --> 02:43:02,700
Is it from Los Angeles to San Francisco?
Let's see.

3720
02:43:02,910 --> 02:43:07,430
381
82 miles from lawson.

3721
02:43:07,470 --> 02:43:09,240
Wow.
Interesting.

3722
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:14,320
What's that mean?
That means you have a raven bro.

3723
02:43:14,630 --> 02:43:16,160
They got straight.
Yeah.

3724
02:43:16,440 --> 02:43:17,320
Straight.
Then go above

3725
02:43:19,320 --> 02:43:20,530
that.
That's never heard that.

3726
02:43:20,531 --> 02:43:21,880
Never heard of that.
That's cool.

3727
02:43:22,420 --> 02:43:24,850
Say that kind of talk.
I'm used to it and I thought you fucking

3728
02:43:25,210 --> 02:43:27,540
city slickers.
Uh,

3729
02:43:27,560 --> 02:43:29,290
that's good.
Um,

3730
02:43:29,291 --> 02:43:32,140
so yeah,
a regular tesla can't do that.

3731
02:43:32,350 --> 02:43:36,190
But they said the new one would be able
to drive all the way there and back.

3732
02:43:36,220 --> 02:43:39,190
That's not true.
Cause that was one of their sayings.

3733
02:43:39,191 --> 02:43:41,910
They said you could drive from San
Francisco to La and back will.

3734
02:43:41,911 --> 02:43:45,520
You definitely couldn't do that because
that's more than 600.

3735
02:43:45,990 --> 02:43:47,890
That's,
that's more maybe the edge of the

3736
02:43:47,891 --> 02:43:50,740
county.
Maybe Carolee,

3737
02:43:51,100 --> 02:43:52,360
let's lock.
Stop lying.

3738
02:43:52,870 --> 02:43:54,400
Stop lying.
You gonna leave me stranded in the

3739
02:43:54,401 --> 02:43:57,400
desert.
I'm going to be somewhere halfway back

3740
02:43:57,401 --> 02:43:59,980
where there's no water and that stupid
piece of Shits gonna run out of

3741
02:43:59,981 --> 02:44:00,670
batteries.

3742
02:44:00,670 --> 02:44:02,590
Stop lying.
Just say it's awesome.

3743
02:44:02,591 --> 02:44:04,810
It goes 600 miles.
Don't say you can go to San Francisco

3744
02:44:04,811 --> 02:44:05,680
and back.
You can't,

3745
02:44:05,950 --> 02:44:08,080
you shouldn't make it.
They should make it a,

3746
02:44:08,081 --> 02:44:10,330
the electric cars.
They should make it wireless charging

3747
02:44:10,331 --> 02:44:12,010
and then have the [inaudible] road
speed.

3748
02:44:12,011 --> 02:44:14,140
Like big mats.
I think they've talked about too.

3749
02:44:14,141 --> 02:44:14,891
Oh really?
Yeah.

3750
02:44:14,891 --> 02:44:16,270
I think they have talked about doing
that.

3751
02:44:16,690 --> 02:44:20,230
They've talked about having people in
some sort of tracks where you know you

3752
02:44:20,231 --> 02:44:23,110
can't change lanes unless like you're in
a specific spot.

3753
02:44:23,111 --> 02:44:26,530
And that that track charges the the lane
up.

3754
02:44:26,660 --> 02:44:28,990
It'd basically be in your own little
trolley car.

3755
02:44:29,140 --> 02:44:32,050
It's cool.
Knows man.

3756
02:44:32,320 --> 02:44:34,330
I think the idea of driving your own car
though,

3757
02:44:34,360 --> 02:44:37,150
that's on the way out for sure.
I think we only have like a few,

3758
02:44:37,630 --> 02:44:40,210
maybe a decade or so.
More of that shit.

3759
02:44:40,450 --> 02:44:40,930
Yeah.
Mike,

3760
02:44:40,930 --> 02:44:42,880
Mike Carr would just with the lane
guidance,

3761
02:44:42,881 --> 02:44:44,650
you know that's,
I did it on the way here.

3762
02:44:44,830 --> 02:44:49,240
I barely drove off from Burbank to here
just because of my link.

3763
02:44:49,270 --> 02:44:52,690
My car just drives itself pretty much.
I just have to put my finger on it so it

3764
02:44:52,691 --> 02:44:55,690
knows that my fingers on it.
What do you think,

3765
02:44:55,691 --> 02:44:56,710
man?
Do you think like,

3766
02:44:57,760 --> 02:44:59,590
do you think people start moving out of
la?

3767
02:44:59,800 --> 02:45:01,660
You think people will realize that,
look at this and go,

3768
02:45:01,661 --> 02:45:03,760
this is unsustainable.
I've got to get out now.

3769
02:45:03,820 --> 02:45:06,100
What do you think?
It'll take something like a fucking

3770
02:45:06,101 --> 02:45:08,980
earthquake or something.
Earthquake or thanksgiving.

3771
02:45:08,981 --> 02:45:12,190
Hollywood continues to die.
You know Hollywood's not going to

3772
02:45:12,191 --> 02:45:14,770
continue to die.
Now it with Youtube and people are doing

3773
02:45:14,771 --> 02:45:17,290
it in their houses.
You don't need to be in Los Angeles

3774
02:45:17,291 --> 02:45:18,010
anymore.
You could.

3775
02:45:18,010 --> 02:45:20,830
That is true that people are making
shitloads of money just from their

3776
02:45:20,831 --> 02:45:23,140
fucking basement.
That is true.

3777
02:45:23,230 --> 02:45:25,420
I mean,
and then the tech community is booming

3778
02:45:25,421 --> 02:45:28,180
and other cities to like Seattle has a
huge tech community.

3779
02:45:28,240 --> 02:45:31,360
You still have to come here though.
So if you're only here for four or five

3780
02:45:31,361 --> 02:45:33,490
days out of the month,
what are you considering that,

3781
02:45:33,520 --> 02:45:37,060
why would you have to come here?
Work for a cooperate?

3782
02:45:37,061 --> 02:45:39,750
I don't know if someone just wants to
stay in La,

3783
02:45:40,090 --> 02:45:42,120
you know what the fuck he saying?
Listen to them.

3784
02:45:43,150 --> 02:45:45,000
There's a reason why when youtube
started,

3785
02:45:45,010 --> 02:45:47,240
all the big people moved here.
They didn't have to move here then they

3786
02:45:47,241 --> 02:45:49,570
were all making money at home.
They'd be like the glamorous thing to

3787
02:45:49,571 --> 02:45:51,880
do.
And Youtube does have offices here.

3788
02:45:52,540 --> 02:45:54,400
The glamorous thing to do I think is
part of it.

3789
02:45:54,401 --> 02:45:55,420
Like come on,
we're gonna move to La.

3790
02:45:55,470 --> 02:45:57,910
If they made the officer's here though,
cause everyone was here.

3791
02:45:57,911 --> 02:45:59,830
That's right bitch.
So well we're here.

3792
02:46:00,250 --> 02:46:02,230
Why we're here.
They go to the offices and he'd be here.

3793
02:46:02,350 --> 02:46:04,210
Well,
the one thing that keeps me,

3794
02:46:04,540 --> 02:46:07,990
there's the comedy store,
there's the podcast and having a great

3795
02:46:08,020 --> 02:46:10,250
supply of guests and being around

3796
02:46:10,250 --> 02:46:11,230
all my friends,
there's,

3797
02:46:11,250 --> 02:46:15,080
this is the reasons to stay here,
but we could just have our mass exodus.

3798
02:46:16,190 --> 02:46:19,310
I've got to get everybody to make enough
money when they could just pull up and

3799
02:46:19,311 --> 02:46:22,910
bail.
That's what everybody's got to be able

3800
02:46:22,911 --> 02:46:27,290
to just pull up and bail and just like
start a new community.

3801
02:46:27,890 --> 02:46:32,690
We could just all move next to doug.
Stan hope too much NYC and you don't,

3802
02:46:32,691 --> 02:46:34,910
you're not going to sleep.
You gotta make your own thing.

3803
02:46:34,940 --> 02:46:39,200
I think we go to like Santa Ynez.
We go to some weird cow country type

3804
02:46:39,201 --> 02:46:41,360
place or people who have their own
chickens.

3805
02:46:41,480 --> 02:46:42,680
Yeah,
that's the move.

3806
02:46:42,730 --> 02:46:45,110
No where like that.
The purge happens like that and then

3807
02:46:45,111 --> 02:46:47,830
they had five years into it,
everyone comes and just kills you and to

3808
02:46:47,930 --> 02:46:49,170
like your city.
Now it's a ghost town.

3809
02:46:49,171 --> 02:46:50,720
Fucking be prepared,
bro

3810
02:46:54,020 --> 02:46:56,030
Brown kind of look all the cool shit in
a cool city.

3811
02:46:56,030 --> 02:46:57,560
It's going to be like the dark tower
movie.

3812
02:46:57,561 --> 02:46:59,900
You gotta be prepared when they come.
Let's just move the solving.

3813
02:47:00,380 --> 02:47:02,350
That's not a bad spot.
If you like to drink a lot of wine.

3814
02:47:02,390 --> 02:47:04,970
Right.
And listen to the ladies talk about the

3815
02:47:04,971 --> 02:47:08,050
health problems and the yamas are llamas
are,

3816
02:47:08,100 --> 02:47:10,400
yeah,
they have like Alpacas up there and they

3817
02:47:10,401 --> 02:47:12,790
have to fight off the mountain lions.
Mountain lions coming chapter.

3818
02:47:12,791 --> 02:47:15,080
I'll pacos.
Yeah,

3819
02:47:15,081 --> 02:47:17,360
there's a,
there's a bunch of amazing spots up the

3820
02:47:17,361 --> 02:47:18,111
coast.
You know,

3821
02:47:18,111 --> 02:47:21,060
it's real interesting.
We lost like hundreds of yards of a

3822
02:47:21,080 --> 02:47:24,590
route.
One a from a giant landslide and they

3823
02:47:24,591 --> 02:47:26,270
still haven't figured out what the fuck
to do.

3824
02:47:26,390 --> 02:47:28,850
Yeah,
it's still right till it still closed.

3825
02:47:28,851 --> 02:47:31,790
Yeah.
They're thinking about putting a road

3826
02:47:31,820 --> 02:47:35,360
over the landslide,
but they don't know when and they want

3827
02:47:35,361 --> 02:47:36,290
to let it settle.
Like,

3828
02:47:36,291 --> 02:47:37,660
Hey,
what?

3829
02:47:37,900 --> 02:47:42,260
What do you do inward?
A little were driving,

3830
02:47:42,261 --> 02:47:44,240
if you're driving near that thing,
he'd be like,

3831
02:47:44,270 --> 02:47:45,081
oh my God.
Oh my God,

3832
02:47:45,081 --> 02:47:48,080
please don't fall please.
And I'll fall like those 300 yards or

3833
02:47:48,081 --> 02:47:50,350
whatever with a landfall was,
look how big it is,

3834
02:47:50,351 --> 02:47:53,210
late 2018 how far is it?
How much of a,

3835
02:47:54,010 --> 02:47:55,100
how much of a landslide is,
oh,

3836
02:47:55,101 --> 02:47:55,881
it's pretty far,
dude.

3837
02:47:55,881 --> 02:47:57,440
You gotta look out tiny.
Those cars are,

3838
02:47:57,470 --> 02:47:58,940
that's hundreds of yards for sure.

3839
02:48:01,400 --> 02:48:03,920
Doesn't,
we'll pull up just so I could see it.

3840
02:48:04,220 --> 02:48:07,190
It ruined 5 million cubic yards.
Hold on.

3841
02:48:07,191 --> 02:48:10,550
Go back up a little bit.
5 million cubic reigned.

3842
02:48:10,670 --> 02:48:15,670
5 million cubic yards of rocks and
debris on the third of the mile.

3843
02:48:15,770 --> 02:48:18,140
Okay,
so it's one third of a mile.

3844
02:48:19,640 --> 02:48:20,960
Wow.
That's a lot.

3845
02:48:21,440 --> 02:48:23,090
That's so big.
You know,

3846
02:48:23,091 --> 02:48:24,350
miles,
5,000 feet.

3847
02:48:24,351 --> 02:48:25,650
Is that what it is?
Three.

3848
02:48:25,670 --> 02:48:30,170
So it's like Holy Shit.
So they should go back to the photo

3849
02:48:30,171 --> 02:48:31,100
again.
Scroll down.

3850
02:48:31,101 --> 02:48:33,890
So I could look at how big that fucking
slide is.

3851
02:48:33,891 --> 02:48:38,000
Just comes off the mountain.
There's a before and after to where they

3852
02:48:38,001 --> 02:48:40,670
show a,
the two stages of the landslide.

3853
02:48:40,760 --> 02:48:45,080
They show it before and then they show
the second stage and then the third

3854
02:48:45,081 --> 02:48:47,270
stage where it finally is.
Now it's fucking crazy,

3855
02:48:47,271 --> 02:48:49,610
man.
Wow.

3856
02:48:50,390 --> 02:48:51,320
Yeah.
It's um,

3857
02:48:51,830 --> 02:48:54,410
they have satellite images of what it
looked like.

3858
02:48:54,411 --> 02:48:55,550
See,
look how much fell off,

3859
02:48:55,551 --> 02:48:55,790
man.

3860
02:48:55,790 --> 02:48:56,780
Look at that.
Boom.

3861
02:48:56,930 --> 02:49:00,800
Just so what do you have to do now?
You just can't even go anywhere near

3862
02:49:00,801 --> 02:49:02,720
there.
Oh No,

3863
02:49:02,750 --> 02:49:05,390
don't drive there.
It's kind of keep following some of

3864
02:49:05,391 --> 02:49:06,890
these houses right there.
Two guys.

3865
02:49:06,900 --> 02:49:10,110
Fuck I'm screwed.
He's so fucked.

3866
02:49:10,111 --> 02:49:12,990
It's going to keep falling like more
parts are going to fall and they think

3867
02:49:12,991 --> 02:49:17,991
part of it is the root system isn't
strong enough to keep the uh,

3868
02:49:18,460 --> 02:49:19,293
the,
the,

3869
02:49:19,440 --> 02:49:21,990
you know like the more trees and roots
you have,

3870
02:49:21,991 --> 02:49:24,870
the less likely it is to have the
landslides I guess because the trees and

3871
02:49:24,871 --> 02:49:29,620
the root system keep all the dirt.
So then if you have poor rainfall then

3872
02:49:29,630 --> 02:49:31,680
the,
the trees don't grow as much and I have

3873
02:49:31,690 --> 02:49:34,440
as much weeds.
You don't have as much shit on the side

3874
02:49:34,441 --> 02:49:35,640
of the hill.
And then there's like,

3875
02:49:35,690 --> 02:49:39,270
you ever seen me drive by Malibu and
they got like cement all up on the side

3876
02:49:39,271 --> 02:49:42,000
of certain hills and like mash and shit
to keep things from falling.

3877
02:49:42,170 --> 02:49:46,890
I these people like holding onto their
chunk of dirt with every tooth and claw.

3878
02:49:49,920 --> 02:49:50,290
Okay.

3879
02:49:50,290 --> 02:49:52,240
Yeah.
It's supposedly like a lot of places

3880
02:49:52,241 --> 02:49:55,900
because of all the fires.
Like this winter it's going to be land

3881
02:49:55,930 --> 02:49:57,970
law,
mudslides everywhere for for us.

3882
02:49:58,240 --> 02:49:59,110
That's what I've heard.
Yeah.

3883
02:49:59,140 --> 02:50:00,100
Yeah.
Burbank.

3884
02:50:00,160 --> 02:50:02,890
They say that the fire,
one thing that the fires are good for

3885
02:50:02,891 --> 02:50:04,600
though.
It's like you need to burn some of that

3886
02:50:04,601 --> 02:50:06,190
shit down and it's supposed to be
healthy,

3887
02:50:06,490 --> 02:50:09,700
puts minerals in the soil and then it
builds things back up and then these

3888
02:50:09,701 --> 02:50:13,870
fires through like lightening strikes
are like super common and then the

3889
02:50:13,871 --> 02:50:16,600
things were burned down and the rain
would come and then they would

3890
02:50:16,601 --> 02:50:19,880
repopulate with new new seeds and shit.
She,

3891
02:50:19,900 --> 02:50:22,280
this guy figured out how to put
together.

3892
02:50:22,760 --> 02:50:24,240
You could stand on it.
Yeah.

3893
02:50:24,270 --> 02:50:25,210
Yeah.
The car on it.

3894
02:50:25,360 --> 02:50:27,190
Yeah.
He put pieces of paper in between the

3895
02:50:27,191 --> 02:50:30,730
sand and then he pulled the sides off of
it and the paper,

3896
02:50:30,760 --> 02:50:35,760
the paper being compressed in between
these pieces of sand allows it to hold

3897
02:50:35,800 --> 02:50:37,780
tremendous weight without losing its
form.

3898
02:50:38,230 --> 02:50:39,100
Weird.
Yeah.

3899
02:50:39,101 --> 02:50:40,720
It's super weird.
See how it is.

3900
02:50:40,960 --> 02:50:42,940
It's like each thing is like a slice,

3901
02:50:43,110 --> 02:50:43,943
right?

3902
02:50:44,780 --> 02:50:47,090
Like see if they show how he did it.
Yeah,

3903
02:50:48,500 --> 02:50:50,480
it's pretty crazy.
It's just sort of how it works.

3904
02:50:50,481 --> 02:50:53,240
Similar how side of it.
That means you said the side of a

3905
02:50:53,241 --> 02:50:54,170
freeway.
Yeah.

3906
02:50:55,850 --> 02:50:56,540
Okay.

3907
02:50:56,540 --> 02:50:58,400
So that's what they do with the side of
the freeways thing.

3908
02:50:58,760 --> 02:51:00,680
That's how they reinforce those things.
Yeah.

3909
02:51:00,681 --> 02:51:03,620
If you see him slowly build it up,
it's kind of crazy to watch them do it.

3910
02:51:03,621 --> 02:51:05,870
But dude,
I watched something really crazy.

3911
02:51:06,090 --> 02:51:07,910
You ever go to the,
if you hi,

3912
02:51:08,120 --> 02:51:10,010
I started falling it cause you retweeted
it.

3913
02:51:10,040 --> 02:51:11,340
Yeah.
If you go to,

3914
02:51:11,341 --> 02:51:14,000
if you high,
they have a thing where they're building

3915
02:51:14,060 --> 02:51:19,020
a bridge and they're moving a fucking
gigantic girder and his girl,

3916
02:51:19,021 --> 02:51:22,970
there's like a hundred yards wide and
they're picking it up.

3917
02:51:23,060 --> 02:51:24,890
Look at this,
this thing,

3918
02:51:24,891 --> 02:51:27,710
it's a machine.
It goes to the end of the bridge where

3919
02:51:27,711 --> 02:51:29,510
the edge is cause they're,
they're building the bridge,

3920
02:51:29,511 --> 02:51:34,370
it stops and then this other thing comes
down and then it moves forward and then

3921
02:51:34,400 --> 02:51:36,830
connects.
It connects with the other side.

3922
02:51:36,890 --> 02:51:38,330
You've seen this.
This is sweet.

3923
02:51:38,331 --> 02:51:39,680
Fuck Dude.
It's crazy.

3924
02:51:40,070 --> 02:51:43,940
So it connects to the aside.
Extends and then once it does that,

3925
02:51:43,941 --> 02:51:46,910
then they bring in this huge cement
girder.

3926
02:51:46,911 --> 02:51:49,760
I mean it is fucking,
you see how small the people look next

3927
02:51:49,761 --> 02:51:52,670
to it.
It's fucking huge.

3928
02:51:53,390 --> 02:51:54,890
This is cool.
It's like a football field,

3929
02:51:54,891 --> 02:51:56,900
right?
I mean isn't it,

3930
02:51:57,290 --> 02:51:59,630
is that close to a football field?
How far is that?

3931
02:52:01,370 --> 02:52:03,620
At least half of one if not at least 50
yards.

3932
02:52:03,621 --> 02:52:06,220
Right.
50 yards of solid and steel.

3933
02:52:06,220 --> 02:52:08,870
It's huge.
And they set it down on top of these

3934
02:52:08,871 --> 02:52:10,720
stone pillars and everybody must be
shitting their pants.

3935
02:52:10,730 --> 02:52:13,720
Go do and we'll get you on up here.
Where's this?

3936
02:52:13,721 --> 02:52:14,860
Japan?
China,

3937
02:52:15,550 --> 02:52:19,000
I don't know.
Asian while joint machinery company.

3938
02:52:19,840 --> 02:52:22,400
I mean that's how they do it man,
right at soc.

3939
02:52:23,230 --> 02:52:26,830
The crazy thing is to think that they
built the Brooklyn Bridge back when when

3940
02:52:26,831 --> 02:52:30,100
they built that God damn thing.
When did they build the San Francisco

3941
02:52:30,100 --> 02:52:31,930
Golden Gate Bridge?
When the fuck did they build that thing?

3942
02:52:32,470 --> 02:52:36,790
I mean that was a long goddamn time ago
and I think still up so weird.

3943
02:52:36,791 --> 02:52:41,500
The idea of building over water till you
have to like go to the point where you

3944
02:52:41,501 --> 02:52:42,850
can drive a car over.
Yeah,

3945
02:52:42,851 --> 02:52:47,560
it's nuts.
1933 the Golden Gate Bridge was built.

3946
02:52:47,650 --> 02:52:50,260
Whew.
That's crazy.

3947
02:52:50,410 --> 02:52:53,920
How long did it take them
people back then?

3948
02:52:53,921 --> 02:52:55,600
Worked harder.
There were different.

3949
02:52:56,230 --> 02:52:57,880
Did stronger hands?
What?

3950
02:52:57,940 --> 02:52:59,770
How?
How many years do you think that took

3951
02:52:59,771 --> 02:53:02,050
the bill?
I want to say it took two years.

3952
02:53:02,080 --> 02:53:04,990
I say five years.
What do you say,

3953
02:53:04,991 --> 02:53:05,824
Jamie?

3954
02:53:08,080 --> 02:53:10,240
I don't know.
At least 10 10 hmm.

3955
02:53:10,330 --> 02:53:11,440
Easily.
Okay.

3956
02:53:11,680 --> 02:53:13,660
Let's see.
I think I'm right.

3957
02:53:14,470 --> 02:53:16,420
I think it's like two years.
What'd you say,

3958
02:53:16,421 --> 02:53:18,190
Brian?
Five to five.

3959
02:53:18,191 --> 02:53:20,650
10 all right.
How long did it take?

3960
02:53:21,040 --> 02:53:23,200
How many workers?
What do we got?

3961
02:53:23,230 --> 02:53:24,640
35 million bucks.
That's it.

3962
02:53:24,820 --> 02:53:26,470
Shit.
That's like j Lo's house.

3963
02:53:28,440 --> 02:53:31,710
Things you may not know
I'm on.

3964
02:53:32,350 --> 02:53:35,980
Why don't you just google?
How long did it take determined?

3965
02:53:36,730 --> 02:53:41,710
How long did it take?
How long did it take to build the Golden

3966
02:53:41,710 --> 02:53:45,100
Gate Bridge for a half years?
Oh yes.

3967
02:53:45,160 --> 02:53:47,320
Four and a half years.
You went over,

3968
02:53:47,321 --> 02:53:48,410
Bro.
It doesn't count.

3969
02:53:49,210 --> 02:53:52,240
You went too far.
I ain't go right.

3970
02:53:52,630 --> 02:53:56,620
Isn't that a price is right word go over
21 no,

3971
02:53:56,621 --> 02:53:58,690
you said hit me and you fucked up.
I go,

3972
02:53:58,730 --> 02:54:00,390
I couldn't with one on one.
Yeah,

3973
02:54:00,400 --> 02:54:04,000
you could have one with one with one
because I had to,

3974
02:54:04,480 --> 02:54:05,710
so I was closer with one day.

3975
02:54:08,340 --> 02:54:09,280
You want a one?
Yeah,

3976
02:54:09,281 --> 02:54:11,800
you would have one that would have,
you would have got that.

3977
02:54:11,980 --> 02:54:14,980
We're not playing by those rules.
That's amazing that they built it that

3978
02:54:14,981 --> 02:54:17,860
quick back.
Then think of that like less than five

3979
02:54:17,861 --> 02:54:19,780
years.
They built this incredible bridge that's

3980
02:54:19,781 --> 02:54:22,840
still up.
Why they did it in the stone age.

3981
02:54:22,841 --> 02:54:24,530
It's a lot more slaves back then.
You know,

3982
02:54:24,640 --> 02:54:26,950
they weren't,
they probably were though.

3983
02:54:26,951 --> 02:54:28,690
Right?
The Chinese people that built the

3984
02:54:28,691 --> 02:54:30,550
railroads,
they weren't technically slaves,

3985
02:54:30,551 --> 02:54:33,670
but they weren't going anywhere either.
The Brooklyn Bridge was in 1870

3986
02:54:35,290 --> 02:54:39,220
we did it first started in 1870
beginning.

3987
02:54:39,221 --> 02:54:41,980
That's a technically 1869 because it was
January 3rd.

3988
02:54:42,130 --> 02:54:44,620
You know what's interesting about that?
They're tearing down a bridge in

3989
02:54:44,621 --> 02:54:47,270
downtown La Right now.
Um,

3990
02:54:47,360 --> 02:54:48,790
the sixth street bridge.
Yes.

3991
02:54:49,370 --> 02:54:50,500
Did it last year,
I think.

3992
02:54:50,530 --> 02:54:51,640
Yeah,
they're there.

3993
02:54:52,050 --> 02:54:56,710
They're rebuilding it because it has
something called concrete cancer.

3994
02:54:57,250 --> 02:55:01,510
Like the concrete was rotting out.
Like how these dummies do such a shitty

3995
02:55:01,511 --> 02:55:03,880
job.
Goddamn la thing.

3996
02:55:03,900 --> 02:55:06,810
Bridge smoked a lot.
Ah,

3997
02:55:07,330 --> 02:55:10,970
all the fucking shitty traffic and bad,
bad air.

3998
02:55:11,540 --> 02:55:15,350
Imagine if that like pollution actually
destroyed concrete.

3999
02:55:15,650 --> 02:55:17,870
Yeah.
Policing has been bad this year in Los

4000
02:55:17,870 --> 02:55:18,030
Angeles.

4001
02:55:18,030 --> 02:55:20,430
Wow.
Beautiful Bridge.

4002
02:55:20,510 --> 02:55:23,750
Last night we were on a no chimney.
We weren't allowed to use fireplaces.

4003
02:55:23,751 --> 02:55:24,630
If you had a fireplace,

4004
02:55:25,090 --> 02:55:26,950
it didn't seem weird.
They can't just fix that.

4005
02:55:27,010 --> 02:55:29,530
Yeah.
It doesn't seem weird.

4006
02:55:30,580 --> 02:55:32,230
I mean,
I guess it makes sense if it's the

4007
02:55:32,231 --> 02:55:36,550
concrete starting to break down,
just what a shit design can you get your

4008
02:55:36,551 --> 02:55:38,800
money back?
You know,

4009
02:55:39,490 --> 02:55:42,820
that was built in 1932.
That's what was always said to those

4010
02:55:42,821 --> 02:55:44,410
nine 11 troopers.
You know,

4011
02:55:44,411 --> 02:55:45,330
like everybody was,
uh,

4012
02:55:45,670 --> 02:55:49,920
they were pissed at this guy that owned
tower seven that,

4013
02:55:49,921 --> 02:55:50,860
you know,
he said pull it,

4014
02:55:50,920 --> 02:55:52,720
pull the building.
You know,

4015
02:55:52,721 --> 02:55:53,830
when I was driving crazy,
like,

4016
02:55:54,190 --> 02:55:56,710
why didn't that Guy Freak out?
That building just collapsed.

4017
02:55:57,510 --> 02:55:59,770
That was my building and it lit on fire.
Just collapse like that.

4018
02:55:59,771 --> 02:56:02,170
I'm like,
who the fuck design this piece of shit?

4019
02:56:02,570 --> 02:56:04,660
Like look at the building.
Look how collapsed.

4020
02:56:05,050 --> 02:56:06,820
Like,
did you guys not know that?

4021
02:56:06,821 --> 02:56:08,580
Maybe it could catch fire.
Did you plan?

4022
02:56:08,620 --> 02:56:09,850
You didn't plan for that.
Okay,

4023
02:56:10,760 --> 02:56:13,630
well you make me a new building,
motherfucker make it so they can light

4024
02:56:13,631 --> 02:56:17,860
on fire and I can just rebuild it.
So make it so collapses shit about the

4025
02:56:17,861 --> 02:56:20,950
extended warranty.
The apple care insurance.

4026
02:56:20,951 --> 02:56:22,390
Right.
That's what,

4027
02:56:22,600 --> 02:56:26,620
that's what those conspiracies about
that he told them to pull the building.

4028
02:56:27,010 --> 02:56:27,843
I have it all collapse.

4029
02:56:27,850 --> 02:56:32,470
Taller insurance companies alive,
you know like look at all the houses in

4030
02:56:32,471 --> 02:56:36,010
Puerto Rico and Texas and all that stuff
that happened this year.

4031
02:56:36,130 --> 02:56:40,240
How has like nationwide still fucking
not running out of money?

4032
02:56:40,870 --> 02:56:43,300
That's a good question.
That's a very good question.

4033
02:56:43,780 --> 02:56:46,300
Yeah,
I mean that's a lot like the cars.

4034
02:56:46,301 --> 02:56:49,540
You see a lot of cars of all the cars
that got ruined for in Houston,

4035
02:56:49,870 --> 02:56:54,610
like judge like thousands of cars and
you can't do anything with those cars.

4036
02:56:54,611 --> 02:56:56,470
You can't sell those cars.
No.

4037
02:56:56,670 --> 02:57:01,150
And one if they can even use the frames.
I mean the frames might be rotten Rustin

4038
02:57:01,180 --> 02:57:03,010
shit,
everything.

4039
02:57:03,760 --> 02:57:08,760
1 million cars and Houston and they're
saying that a lot of them are being sold

4040
02:57:10,330 --> 02:57:14,590
in like Los Angeles and stuff.
People are buying them and trying to

4041
02:57:15,130 --> 02:57:17,760
clean them up to make them look like
they fine.

4042
02:57:17,800 --> 02:57:19,600
Well I wonder if you could as rewire
them.

4043
02:57:20,140 --> 02:57:21,070
No,
there's,

4044
02:57:21,071 --> 02:57:26,071
I mean there's so much like mold and
stuff in there and all of a mechanic now

4045
02:57:26,591 --> 02:57:29,140
I saw,
I think I saw a thing on it on the news

4046
02:57:29,170 --> 02:57:30,670
like,
like why they can't use them.

4047
02:57:30,671 --> 02:57:33,910
I forget what his car got flooded when,
when like in the 90s when it flooded in

4048
02:57:33,911 --> 02:57:35,470
Ohio,
we lived on the bottom of the hill.

4049
02:57:35,520 --> 02:57:37,290
Whole shit flooded.
A lot of people's houses are owned.

4050
02:57:37,430 --> 02:57:39,340
Car was fucked and didn't even get that
much water in it.

4051
02:57:39,640 --> 02:57:41,140
Wow.
Here's total it.

4052
02:57:41,141 --> 02:57:43,120
Shouldn't they made a car that you can
get wet?

4053
02:57:43,300 --> 02:57:45,130
Yeah,
like a little waterproof car.

4054
02:57:45,160 --> 02:57:46,420
You can drive it in the lake,
but like,

4055
02:57:46,421 --> 02:57:50,410
no one ever wanted that piece of shit
like member when they couldn't do that

4056
02:57:50,411 --> 02:57:52,270
with the iphone.
So like there's no work can make a

4057
02:57:52,271 --> 02:57:53,140
waterproof.
Right.

4058
02:57:53,290 --> 02:57:55,090
Well that's one thing to raise.
Your phone's not waterproof.

4059
02:57:55,120 --> 02:57:56,070
It's not.
Nope.

4060
02:57:56,380 --> 02:57:57,640
Nope.
Nowadays,

4061
02:57:57,910 --> 02:57:58,990
yeah.
Nowadays you need that.

4062
02:57:58,991 --> 02:58:00,520
But it does have a,
um,

4063
02:58:00,550 --> 02:58:03,900
the power button right here.
It's also a thumb print sensor sensor.

4064
02:58:03,990 --> 02:58:05,610
Yeah.
I mean,

4065
02:58:05,611 --> 02:58:06,700
it's a beautiful phone.
It's,

4066
02:58:06,701 --> 02:58:09,150
it's weird how the designs,
I can't square,

4067
02:58:09,400 --> 02:58:10,233
like,
it's a,

4068
02:58:10,890 --> 02:58:13,230
what's the battery life on it?
Phenomenal.

4069
02:58:13,260 --> 02:58:15,930
It's 4,000 Milli amps or using it as
your main phone right now.

4070
02:58:15,960 --> 02:58:16,793
No.
Hmm.

4071
02:58:16,830 --> 02:58:19,610
No.
Mostly using it to play games on fuck

4072
02:58:19,620 --> 02:58:20,520
around with it.
Yeah.

4073
02:58:21,070 --> 02:58:21,990
Just,
yeah.

4074
02:58:22,050 --> 02:58:23,970
It's,
the sound is amazing when you play music

4075
02:58:23,971 --> 02:58:25,020
on,
it's fucking incredible.

4076
02:58:25,470 --> 02:58:27,250
The game.
And it's supposed to be bad ass.

4077
02:58:27,560 --> 02:58:30,450
Like watching a youtube video,
like it's fucking loud.

4078
02:58:30,480 --> 02:58:33,780
Like you're watching it on a laptop with
really good screen speakers turned out

4079
02:58:33,781 --> 02:58:34,890
in the 120 hertz.
Right?

4080
02:58:35,160 --> 02:58:37,320
Yes.
That's the other thing is that it's one

4081
02:58:37,321 --> 02:58:38,510
of the very few,
um,

4082
02:58:38,610 --> 02:58:43,560
cell phones that has 120 rate a hertz
frame rate that's crew fringe.

4083
02:58:43,570 --> 02:58:46,500
So it means that you get 120 frames per
second sometimes,

4084
02:58:46,920 --> 02:58:48,000
you know,
depending upon the game,

4085
02:58:48,001 --> 02:58:51,100
which is like Super Silky smooth.
If you're playing something like,

4086
02:58:51,110 --> 02:58:52,950
and you're watching video and think most
things,

4087
02:58:52,980 --> 02:58:54,420
it's not gonna be able to take advantage
of it,

4088
02:58:54,421 --> 02:58:56,910
but games,
a lot of games can cause this out yet.

4089
02:58:57,200 --> 02:58:57,601
Yeah,
yeah,

4090
02:58:57,601 --> 02:58:58,620
yeah.
Yeah.

4091
02:58:59,550 --> 02:59:00,410
Dude,
there's a lot of,

4092
02:59:00,570 --> 02:59:03,660
there's one called a,
I was watching unblocks therapy on

4093
02:59:03,661 --> 02:59:05,160
blocks,
unbox therapy.

4094
02:59:05,161 --> 02:59:05,540
He,
uh,

4095
02:59:05,540 --> 02:59:09,090
Lewis had a,
an article or a video rather on the one

4096
02:59:09,470 --> 02:59:10,680
fte.
Is that it?

4097
02:59:10,740 --> 02:59:12,510
Yeah.
Five t is that it?

4098
02:59:12,630 --> 02:59:14,910
One plus five team is that,
I say it,

4099
02:59:15,630 --> 02:59:18,270
see if that's the right thing to say.
But that thing looks fucking incredible.

4100
02:59:18,720 --> 02:59:19,980
The big one.
Yeah.

4101
02:59:19,981 --> 02:59:20,814
And it's,
uh,

4102
02:59:20,850 --> 02:59:23,730
it's half the price of like a,
a galaxy note.

4103
02:59:23,760 --> 02:59:28,140
Eight or $299 500 bucks.
500 bucks plus five.

4104
02:59:28,460 --> 02:59:29,340
Yeah.
The thing.

4105
02:59:29,341 --> 02:59:31,980
So,
so like my point was that the level of

4106
02:59:31,981 --> 02:59:32,521
cell phone,
look,

4107
02:59:32,521 --> 02:59:35,130
look,
your iphone x 10 sorry,

4108
02:59:35,250 --> 02:59:35,821
sorry.
Nervous,

4109
02:59:35,821 --> 02:59:40,110
don't get mad.
It's x doin bro or even you know any of

4110
02:59:40,111 --> 02:59:42,120
the new,
the new Google pixels,

4111
02:59:42,960 --> 02:59:46,200
the level's so high now.
Everything the Samsung note.

4112
02:59:46,420 --> 02:59:50,660
So like these everything is like I was
watching a video comparison and there

4113
02:59:50,661 --> 02:59:53,160
are nitpicking.
I mean these guys are nit picking,

4114
02:59:53,400 --> 02:59:56,250
try to find anything wrong with any of
these phones and like these things are

4115
02:59:56,251 --> 02:59:59,850
like they're,
they're literally like science fiction

4116
02:59:59,851 --> 03:00:01,740
from 10 years ago,
10 years ago.

4117
03:00:01,741 --> 03:00:05,160
The things that these things can do,
the opens with your face,

4118
03:00:05,370 --> 03:00:07,770
you look at it and it opens the one ft
has that too.

4119
03:00:08,700 --> 03:00:11,190
Yeah.
One plus my note has it,

4120
03:00:11,220 --> 03:00:12,900
my note eight.
It does have that or whatever.

4121
03:00:12,901 --> 03:00:14,370
Yeah.
I mean he has it but it's not,

4122
03:00:14,400 --> 03:00:15,510
it's the same level.

4123
03:00:15,820 --> 03:00:18,510
Like you have to like stick it in your
face and be like do like if that was the

4124
03:00:18,511 --> 03:00:22,410
thing that the note has a retina
detection,

4125
03:00:22,470 --> 03:00:25,260
which is different.
This is facial recognition.

4126
03:00:25,620 --> 03:00:29,490
And then the one plus ft has an even
better version of [inaudible] facial

4127
03:00:29,491 --> 03:00:32,160
recognition than the iphone.
And Louis was showing a quick,

4128
03:00:32,161 --> 03:00:33,640
it opens this.
Oh Wow.

4129
03:00:33,700 --> 03:00:35,510
Maybe pan.
Yeah.

4130
03:00:35,550 --> 03:00:37,380
And it also has a fingerprint sensor in
the back,

4131
03:00:37,381 --> 03:00:38,870
which the iphone doesn't have.
Yeah.

4132
03:00:39,100 --> 03:00:41,130
And a big ass screen.
It's got a big ass green,

4133
03:00:41,131 --> 03:00:44,360
a little tiny ass bezels look smooth,
like the level,

4134
03:00:44,380 --> 03:00:47,940
my point is just super high right now.
We're dorks like you and me.

4135
03:00:48,550 --> 03:00:51,270
Very lucky.
And they're saying the next year one,

4136
03:00:51,690 --> 03:00:54,120
they're already guessing at what nick
next year's.

4137
03:00:54,150 --> 03:00:55,730
I don't fold.
You know,

4138
03:00:55,740 --> 03:00:58,150
they,
they got a patent for folding fold,

4139
03:00:58,230 --> 03:01:00,370
which is cool in some ways.

4140
03:01:00,610 --> 03:01:02,410
Like imagine having like a normal size
phone,

4141
03:01:02,411 --> 03:01:05,320
but then you could fold it and make it
an ipad.

4142
03:01:05,590 --> 03:01:08,710
You know what I mean?
Apparently they're really close to doing

4143
03:01:08,711 --> 03:01:09,544
something like that

4144
03:01:09,600 --> 03:01:12,500
and that's,
I think there's at one point in time

4145
03:01:12,501 --> 03:01:14,480
they're gonna figure out a way to put it
in your,

4146
03:01:14,510 --> 03:01:15,343
in your glass.

4147
03:01:16,430 --> 03:01:17,800
Yeah.
I think it's going to be more like,

4148
03:01:17,830 --> 03:01:21,740
like glasses or even just like a contact
lens that you never take out.

4149
03:01:21,800 --> 03:01:22,633
Kind of like

4150
03:01:22,810 --> 03:01:26,830
dope sunglasses,
like some cool like frame,

4151
03:01:26,831 --> 03:01:31,831
like Elton John's style frames and you
have like just a full screen computer

4152
03:01:32,020 --> 03:01:34,030
playing a virtual reality in front of
you all the time.

4153
03:01:34,270 --> 03:01:35,890
Yeah.
That might be the way to go.

4154
03:01:35,950 --> 03:01:39,150
I can't believe Google glasses didn't
really take off too much stuff that

4155
03:01:39,160 --> 03:01:39,850
good.
Yeah,

4156
03:01:39,850 --> 03:01:41,860
it was too small.
You were looking at it.

4157
03:01:42,100 --> 03:01:43,170
I tried it once.
I did it.

4158
03:01:43,180 --> 03:01:45,160
I've worn during one of the UFC wayans
here.

4159
03:01:45,400 --> 03:01:47,230
Um,
you're looking at this little thing over

4160
03:01:47,231 --> 03:01:49,540
here and you look down,
you could see it and you can look up and

4161
03:01:49,541 --> 03:01:51,510
you don't,
you kind of look past it but it's kind

4162
03:01:51,511 --> 03:01:53,110
of,
there wasn't right.

4163
03:01:53,200 --> 03:01:56,590
It wasn't the right thing.
I think augmented reality where you

4164
03:01:56,591 --> 03:01:59,350
either looking through your phone or you
have glasses on,

4165
03:01:59,530 --> 03:02:02,440
like that's what I think you're going to
have like clear glasses on and you're

4166
03:02:02,441 --> 03:02:04,960
going to have your phone and you're
going to be able to do is switch to

4167
03:02:04,961 --> 03:02:07,930
glass mode and your phone will be in
your pocket and it'll bluetooth with the

4168
03:02:07,931 --> 03:02:10,600
glasses and the glasses will be able to
pull up anything.

4169
03:02:11,150 --> 03:02:12,970
That was the other thing that's pretty
crazy about,

4170
03:02:13,050 --> 03:02:14,650
um,
some of the new google devices.

4171
03:02:15,400 --> 03:02:18,190
You take a photo of something and it
tells you what that thing is.

4172
03:02:19,570 --> 03:02:22,630
Like you take a photo of the coliseum
and it'll say there's the colosseum in

4173
03:02:22,631 --> 03:02:23,081
Rome.
You're like,

4174
03:02:23,081 --> 03:02:23,651
what?
Yeah,

4175
03:02:23,651 --> 03:02:25,420
the new pixel does.
It has that built in.

4176
03:02:25,510 --> 03:02:26,410
This isn't,
how about this.

4177
03:02:26,620 --> 03:02:28,420
They have this thing called the pixel
book.

4178
03:02:28,450 --> 03:02:32,320
We've seen the pixel book.
You buy a pen and you circle things on a

4179
03:02:32,321 --> 03:02:34,180
screen and it tells you what those
things are.

4180
03:02:34,390 --> 03:02:35,770
Yeah.
My it has that.

4181
03:02:35,771 --> 03:02:36,830
Yeah.
My no aid.

4182
03:02:36,870 --> 03:02:39,670
My note eight.
You can just circle like a sentence and

4183
03:02:39,671 --> 03:02:41,980
it will translate it on four year,
dude.

4184
03:02:42,040 --> 03:02:43,960
Yeah,
it's pretty second how long

4185
03:02:44,060 --> 03:02:47,150
for that becomes just standard,
you know,

4186
03:02:47,151 --> 03:02:51,260
and how much we're going to get to some
sort of Rosetta stone type situation

4187
03:02:51,290 --> 03:02:54,890
where we can read each other's thoughts.
Like you'll be able to just talk.

4188
03:02:55,400 --> 03:02:58,040
I mean,
right now the note taking software is

4189
03:02:58,041 --> 03:03:00,140
pretty damn good.
It's pretty God damn good.

4190
03:03:00,590 --> 03:03:03,320
Like if you talk into your phone,
whether it's with Google notes or

4191
03:03:03,360 --> 03:03:06,800
anything else with apple notes,
it'll pick up your voice very,

4192
03:03:06,801 --> 03:03:08,580
very well.
But what,

4193
03:03:08,610 --> 03:03:10,460
what is it going to be like in five
years from now?

4194
03:03:10,520 --> 03:03:12,590
It's going to be incredible.
And you're gonna be able to do it in

4195
03:03:12,591 --> 03:03:14,420
real time like they're doing with those
ear buds,

4196
03:03:14,421 --> 03:03:16,270
those Google earbuds,
you know,

4197
03:03:16,280 --> 03:03:18,200
they're gonna be able to do that in real
time all the time.

4198
03:03:18,201 --> 03:03:20,710
And so there's going to be no language
barriers than anybody ever has with

4199
03:03:20,720 --> 03:03:21,770
anybody else.
It's amazing,

4200
03:03:21,771 --> 03:03:23,310
isn't it weird?
Yeah,

4201
03:03:23,690 --> 03:03:26,210
it's crazy.
And then when you have the robot fights

4202
03:03:26,630 --> 03:03:29,510
between the robot fights and no language
barriers.

4203
03:03:29,690 --> 03:03:31,730
Yeah.
Arrange.

4204
03:03:31,820 --> 03:03:34,740
What is this?
I saw this at twitchcon.

4205
03:03:34,780 --> 03:03:37,460
Is this eye tracking new?
Uh,

4206
03:03:37,570 --> 03:03:40,550
it's replaces your mouse basically using
your eyes.

4207
03:03:40,610 --> 03:03:41,840
Yeah.
It's a little sensor that's on the

4208
03:03:41,841 --> 03:03:43,570
bottom right below your,
uh,

4209
03:03:44,250 --> 03:03:46,280
right below your screen.
Kind of like where the folders on your

4210
03:03:46,281 --> 03:03:49,580
laptop basically.
And you do a little bit of setting up

4211
03:03:49,610 --> 03:03:52,280
and it literally tracks everything
you're looking at.

4212
03:03:52,340 --> 03:03:53,740
Oh my God did it really well.
I saw,

4213
03:03:53,810 --> 03:03:55,430
I saw a little test right in front of
me.

4214
03:03:55,750 --> 03:03:57,050
Well,
that worked for games.

4215
03:03:57,080 --> 03:03:57,913
That's the idea.

4216
03:03:58,700 --> 03:04:02,030
If you're a tired though,
maybe you bitch,

4217
03:04:02,870 --> 03:04:05,030
that'd be insane.
You imagine if you got that down to

4218
03:04:05,031 --> 03:04:05,930
games and your,
your,

4219
03:04:05,931 --> 03:04:08,360
your cursor moved exactly where you
wanted to go.

4220
03:04:08,510 --> 03:04:11,090
It might be too easy be fucking people
up with that.

4221
03:04:11,700 --> 03:04:12,570
Wait a second.
This is,

4222
03:04:12,630 --> 03:04:14,820
is this an old video?
Because it just said like,

4223
03:04:14,821 --> 03:04:19,200
they were just advertising the head u s
2.09 instead of 3.0 I just works over

4224
03:04:19,201 --> 03:04:20,910
two point doesn't need 3.0 I see.

4225
03:04:21,380 --> 03:04:24,710
Wow.
Tagged your enemies by glancing at them.

4226
03:04:24,740 --> 03:04:26,060
Boom,
boom.

4227
03:04:26,570 --> 03:04:27,370
Oh my God.

4228
03:04:27,370 --> 03:04:29,980
Yeah.
So whether or not games actually needed

4229
03:04:29,981 --> 03:04:31,180
or it becomes,
uh,

4230
03:04:31,240 --> 03:04:34,000
something actually useful in the future.
We'll see.

4231
03:04:34,060 --> 03:04:36,340
But that's just,
it's been announced and that's coming

4232
03:04:36,341 --> 03:04:39,130
soon or it's out now.
Some alienware laptops that think or

4233
03:04:39,131 --> 03:04:40,210
having it built into it.

4234
03:04:40,720 --> 03:04:43,260
I do not even with my eyes,
daymond my eyes.

4235
03:04:43,440 --> 03:04:47,460
Just forget the face of your father.
Yeah,

4236
03:04:47,461 --> 03:04:48,300
we're,
I mean,

4237
03:04:48,301 --> 03:04:50,880
we're at the cusp of some really wacky
virtual reality,

4238
03:04:50,881 --> 03:04:54,000
augmented reality type shit that's just
around the corner.

4239
03:04:54,030 --> 03:04:57,300
It's going to happen.
It's going to take us by storm and it's

4240
03:04:57,301 --> 03:04:59,160
going to be just like all these other
things that we use,

4241
03:04:59,161 --> 03:05:02,490
like automatically wouldn't even think
about it because before twitter existed

4242
03:05:02,570 --> 03:05:04,860
that you didn't even think about it
before podcasts existed,

4243
03:05:04,861 --> 03:05:06,900
you'd never even thought this would
could be a possibility.

4244
03:05:07,380 --> 03:05:09,420
That's going to be the new one that's
going to,

4245
03:05:09,930 --> 03:05:13,120
that's going to be fucking crazy.
Some augmented reality type shit that

4246
03:05:13,130 --> 03:05:16,230
you were then eventually they're going
to have the robot eyeballs.

4247
03:05:17,280 --> 03:05:19,470
Brian's going to go,
he's going to be an early adopter.

4248
03:05:19,471 --> 03:05:20,950
I do.
One of them starts hard,

4249
03:05:20,970 --> 03:05:23,550
worn glasses can read my phone.

4250
03:05:24,080 --> 03:05:29,080
I've lost my glasses but I would do one
first if if after a few years of testing

4251
03:05:29,631 --> 03:05:31,490
and stuff like that.
But uh,

4252
03:05:31,750 --> 03:05:35,330
what did you do one and try one out?
I think there's gonna be a bunch of

4253
03:05:35,331 --> 03:05:37,280
options.
I think there's going to be options in

4254
03:05:37,281 --> 03:05:41,690
terms of like augmented parts and then I
think there's also going to be options

4255
03:05:41,691 --> 03:05:44,690
in terms of like dumb being able to
regenerate parts.

4256
03:05:44,900 --> 03:05:47,800
I think that's just around the corner
too cause they already being,

4257
03:05:47,870 --> 03:05:50,180
they can regenerate a lot of shit now
with stem cells.

4258
03:05:50,530 --> 03:05:54,350
They grew a woman's bladder.
They made a bladder with skin cells and

4259
03:05:54,590 --> 03:05:56,150
grew.
She had bladder cancer,

4260
03:05:56,180 --> 03:05:57,290
they grew her a new bladder.

4261
03:05:57,680 --> 03:06:00,860
There was that guy that's growing a new
nose on his forehead.

4262
03:06:00,930 --> 03:06:01,790
Have,
do you see that?

4263
03:06:01,870 --> 03:06:03,530
Is that from the same thing from stem
cells?

4264
03:06:03,920 --> 03:06:05,890
Jesus.
And it's weird like on his 40

4265
03:06:05,891 --> 03:06:09,950
[inaudible] he has a nose growing or
it's an ear and he's growing it for him.

4266
03:06:09,980 --> 03:06:10,813
His nose

4267
03:06:10,950 --> 03:06:14,820
let us do that for,
I don't know where hats,

4268
03:06:14,830 --> 03:06:16,200
no one would know.
I saw a dude.

4269
03:06:16,201 --> 03:06:18,260
We're a video rather,
where dude was getting,

4270
03:06:18,450 --> 03:06:19,560
there we go.
Oh Jesus.

4271
03:06:19,780 --> 03:06:21,210
It's going to have a crazy knows guide
one.

4272
03:06:23,520 --> 03:06:25,650
That's so weird.
It looks fake,

4273
03:06:25,651 --> 03:06:28,380
but it's on national geographic's.
Yeah,

4274
03:06:28,381 --> 03:06:30,690
it's real.
What's wrong with his regular knows it.

4275
03:06:30,800 --> 03:06:31,633
I think

4276
03:06:31,900 --> 03:06:33,140
some,
I forget what happened.

4277
03:06:33,530 --> 03:06:35,030
Wow,
that's so strange.

4278
03:06:35,060 --> 03:06:35,940
Oh,
it looks like it was burnt,

4279
03:06:37,190 --> 03:06:39,020
man.
That's,

4280
03:06:39,200 --> 03:06:41,720
that's another really crazy thing.
Have you ever seen what they do with,

4281
03:06:41,721 --> 03:06:44,780
um,
with a skin that's been burnt now?

4282
03:06:44,900 --> 03:06:48,650
They spray stem cells,
all of the skin and it kills the burns

4283
03:06:48,770 --> 03:06:52,040
and a regenerates fresh tissue in those
areas and you don't have a scar.

4284
03:06:52,160 --> 03:06:54,320
That's sweet.
That's like science fiction.

4285
03:06:54,410 --> 03:06:56,160
I mean that's literally out of star wars

4286
03:06:56,160 --> 03:06:57,870
or something.
Like when you see it,

4287
03:06:57,920 --> 03:06:58,460
they,
they,

4288
03:06:58,460 --> 03:07:02,010
they show people with these like really
bad third degree burns are pretty fucked

4289
03:07:02,011 --> 03:07:07,011
up and they spray this stem cell mist
all over them and then their skin just

4290
03:07:08,161 --> 03:07:12,230
regenerate tissue,
like sweet feeling.

4291
03:07:12,640 --> 03:07:14,190
Yeah.
But it's really,

4292
03:07:14,191 --> 03:07:17,160
essentially we're talking about
something that had just a decade or two

4293
03:07:17,161 --> 03:07:20,640
ago would be absolutely witchcraft.
You know,

4294
03:07:21,450 --> 03:07:22,500
fuck man.
And they're,

4295
03:07:22,520 --> 03:07:26,070
they're blocking it to like,
we could be farther ahead in this whole

4296
03:07:26,610 --> 03:07:31,610
field if they let stem cell shit be
little bit more legal here now then it

4297
03:07:33,650 --> 03:07:36,370
then it used to be,
but I think the real issue was during

4298
03:07:36,371 --> 03:07:39,100
the Bush administration,
I think it was like fetal stem cells

4299
03:07:39,101 --> 03:07:41,680
they had a problem with,
they're really worried that people are

4300
03:07:41,681 --> 03:07:46,300
going to get abortions just on purpose
so they could sell the babies to stem

4301
03:07:46,301 --> 03:07:49,570
cell places and that people would be as
super immoral and just have a bunch of

4302
03:07:49,571 --> 03:07:51,640
abortions and make money off the baby
tissue.

4303
03:07:51,641 --> 03:07:52,474
I was like,
Ooh.

4304
03:07:53,080 --> 03:07:55,510
Which it tells my son.
So that's the problem,

4305
03:07:55,870 --> 03:07:56,880
right?
The problem has like,

4306
03:07:56,890 --> 03:07:59,170
like no,
nobody would do that.

4307
03:07:59,350 --> 03:08:01,870
Yes they would.
Motherfucker hasn't been approved yet.

4308
03:08:02,500 --> 03:08:04,840
So put it on paypal.
Jane's crimes when you're waiting

4309
03:08:04,841 --> 03:08:08,080
forever.
Ah Dude.

4310
03:08:08,081 --> 03:08:09,730
If you got burnt and they offered it to
you,

4311
03:08:09,940 --> 03:08:11,950
take it.
There's videos.

4312
03:08:12,170 --> 03:08:13,120
The videos are good.

4313
03:08:15,590 --> 03:08:19,060
Just here's the thing.
All the people that are like crazy

4314
03:08:19,061 --> 03:08:23,370
conspiracy theorists and worried about
science and Ugh,

4315
03:08:23,920 --> 03:08:27,250
you got to realize that science is
responsible for this kind of shit.

4316
03:08:27,280 --> 03:08:29,260
Science might be able to save one of
your kids.

4317
03:08:29,560 --> 03:08:34,150
Science might be able to fix your body.
These people are smarter than us.

4318
03:08:34,480 --> 03:08:38,770
We need to respect them and they're not
lying about this stuff.

4319
03:08:38,800 --> 03:08:40,150
Yeah.
There's people in the medical industry

4320
03:08:40,151 --> 03:08:42,940
that make a lot of money off of
pharmaceutical drugs at a bunch of

4321
03:08:42,941 --> 03:08:45,910
things that make people super addicted
and fuck up your life.

4322
03:08:45,911 --> 03:08:48,100
There's that too.
But there's also this,

4323
03:08:48,400 --> 03:08:49,630
it's like,
it's not perfect.

4324
03:08:49,720 --> 03:08:51,520
You should definitely call out the parts
that are bad,

4325
03:08:52,150 --> 03:08:55,570
but you kind of respect the people that
are smarter than us that are making all

4326
03:08:55,571 --> 03:08:58,570
the awesome shit.
Cause it's not you and it's not me.

4327
03:08:58,660 --> 03:08:59,493
Right.

4328
03:08:59,710 --> 03:09:00,880
But Jesus,
Joe,

4329
03:09:01,520 --> 03:09:03,950
Jesus made the people that made the
awesome shit.

4330
03:09:03,951 --> 03:09:04,880
So there,
I'll give you that.

4331
03:09:04,910 --> 03:09:06,920
How about that?
We'll leave it up,

4332
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:08,990
uh,
and walk away.

4333
03:09:08,991 --> 03:09:10,590
Friends.
Ah,

4334
03:09:10,620 --> 03:09:12,560
you got to show big show is tonight.
Tonight.

4335
03:09:12,561 --> 03:09:13,500
Yeah.

4336
03:09:14,400 --> 03:09:15,710
Asher,
Marilyn rights.

4337
03:09:15,711 --> 03:09:18,320
Got a bunch of people bringing Shoub
Brendan Schaub.

4338
03:09:18,380 --> 03:09:20,370
Um,
Lucas Lucas our,

4339
03:09:20,580 --> 03:09:23,950
yeah.
Well my watch and my Watkins Pat Reagan.

4340
03:09:23,970 --> 03:09:25,250
Oh Shit.
Going to be fun is that,

4341
03:09:25,251 --> 03:09:28,880
that's an Iot comedy store.
And then tomorrow I'm doing Sam Tripoli

4342
03:09:28,890 --> 03:09:31,700
show that's in the main room.
That's got a bunch of killers on it to

4343
03:09:31,940 --> 03:09:33,330
good times.
Ah,

4344
03:09:33,420 --> 03:09:34,700
this weekend,
Detroit,

4345
03:09:35,060 --> 03:09:36,860
I think shows are sold out.
I don't know.

4346
03:09:37,550 --> 03:09:40,880
I should pay more attention,
but we'll be back tomorrow with ct

4347
03:09:40,881 --> 03:09:44,330
Fletcher and Brian Callen.
It's a fucking double header day.

4348
03:09:44,510 --> 03:09:46,340
No,
I won't let Brian Cowen ruined ct

4349
03:09:46,341 --> 03:09:47,930
flushes interview.
Don't worry.

4350
03:09:47,931 --> 03:09:50,420
CTB be by himself then.
Brian Count will be later.

4351
03:09:56,590 --> 03:09:57,610
Ah.
