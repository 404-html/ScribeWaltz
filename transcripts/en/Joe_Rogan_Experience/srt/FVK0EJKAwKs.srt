1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,120
Whether my brother just has
this expression where you
just kind of gives me the

2
00:00:03,121 --> 00:00:03,841
slow nod,

3
00:00:03,841 --> 00:00:05,730
which is he's gone,

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:06,061
you know,

5
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:09,180
my father was dead and I went in and I
saw him on a Gurney and shit and it was

6
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:12,240
so strange and I go
outside and I was a smoker,

7
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:15,360
like cigarette smoker in those days I
was going to have a cigarette and uh,

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,910
Donald comes out and I was like,

9
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:18,120
uh,

10
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,953
oh,

11
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,910
this is a shock and whatever,

12
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:21,181
you know,

13
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:22,260
we're upset and stuff.

14
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,371
And uh,

15
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:23,821
I said,

16
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:25,560
how was it because he was there.

17
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:25,801
I said,

18
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:26,401
what happened?

19
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:30,930
And Donald tells me the story of like
a dad woke up and had this like big

20
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:31,561
reaction.

21
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:32,281
Like just like,

22
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:32,821
I'm hot,

23
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:33,191
I'm hot,

24
00:00:33,191 --> 00:00:34,290
there's thrown the sheets off.

25
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:35,640
And Mom Freq test.

26
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:35,821
She's like,

27
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:36,301
what's the matter?

28
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:36,721
What's the matter?

29
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:37,650
She told Donald Call,

30
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:38,490
I'd call the ambulance,

31
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:39,324
call the hospital,

32
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,670
and he was gone within seconds.

33
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,060
So that's bad enough.

34
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:45,451
You know,

35
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:46,770
he was hot and uncomfortable.

36
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:47,640
You don't want to hear like,

37
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:47,761
oh,

38
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:49,980
he died in his sleep and we
woke up and he just didn't.

39
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,720
But then my brother says,

40
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:53,370
this thing probably defined my life.

41
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:54,300
My brother goes,

42
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:55,134
uh,

43
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,230
he died screaming and I go,

44
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,520
what?

45
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,031
And he goes,

46
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:00,330
he,

47
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,470
he died screaming.

48
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:01,990
And I was like,

49
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,280
w I mean as,

50
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,660
is that a figure of speech?

51
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:05,430
And he goes,

52
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:05,611
no,

53
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:06,241
he literally,

54
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:10,560
he died screaming and you could
see my brother was haunted by it.

55
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,330
And my father wasn't like a,

56
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,520
I wouldn't say he was a
butch man or a strong man,

57
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,160
but he wasn't a soft men money
stretch of the imagination.

58
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,610
And I never heard him get real
loud or anything like that.

59
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:22,440
And the notion of my father dying,

60
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:23,274
screaming,

61
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,301
changed my life.

62
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:25,080
Cause I was like,

63
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,820
even a good man in this world.

64
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,930
You played a game,

65
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,920
he played straight.

66
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:30,090
You play by the rules,

67
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:31,500
you do everything you're supposed to,

68
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,850
you're going to die screaming.

69
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:33,960
And at that point I was like,

70
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:38,961
there's no point in not trying to
accomplish every stupid fucking dream I've

71
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:39,541
got.

72
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:41,250
Even if it's dumb shit,

73
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:41,941
like fucking,

74
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:42,211
you know,

75
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:43,044
Oh my God,

76
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,460
I've always wanted to collect this money.

77
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:46,770
Fucking a Wayne Gretzky
cards in one fucking binder.

78
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,570
Or if it's like I want to make a movie,

79
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:51,930
or if it's like I want to put on a podcast
or I want to do a TV show now I want

80
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:52,764
to write a book,

81
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,030
chase it all down.

82
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,370
Chasing whimsy is what I've been
doing for the last few years.

83
00:01:56,371 --> 00:02:00,240
Just smoking weed and chances went
whimsies anytime I'm like back in the day,

84
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:01,074
I'd have a good idea,

85
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,820
something I really wanted
to follow through on it.

86
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:03,930
And also you can get scared.

87
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,810
You start thinking about some of what
some of the fucker's going to say and be

88
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:07,020
like,

89
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,171
oh,

90
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:07,771
it's stupid.

91
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:08,970
Why would you fucking do that?

92
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:09,810
And fucking why?

93
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:10,201
Why?

94
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:11,520
A lot of why people in this world,

95
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:14,700
I try to surround myself with the why
nots motherfuckers who you're like,

96
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,571
I want to try this.

97
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:16,410
Like why not?

98
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:16,861
Let's go,

99
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:17,641
let's give it a shot.

100
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:18,540
You gotta be game man.

101
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,220
People help you achieve
your dreams and shit.

102
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:21,450
So for me,

103
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,010
the last few years I've just been trying
to accomplish every dopey dream to big

104
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:26,371
shit.

105
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:27,780
The little shit you got to do them all.

106
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:30,180
You can't just do the
climb every mountain shit,

107
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,340
you know he did sometimes late a bar down,

108
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:36,180
step over it and be like to the house so
you feel accomplished but chase it all

109
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,650
and do it all because we're all gonna
die screaming and you might as well enjoy

110
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:42,270
it here and I and when I say chase Saul,

111
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,520
don't fucking do it at the
expense of someone else.

112
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,180
Obviously don't hurt somebody
else but go after your dreams man.

113
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:50,580
If your dream is to like I
want to kill 12 children,

114
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:50,941
that's,

115
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:52,470
I'm not saying I'm not talking to you,

116
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,990
but go after your dreams if
they're not going to hurt anybody.

117
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:00,110
You seem now I wish I knew you before you
became famous because you seem like if

118
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:01,090
I had a guess,

119
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,470
I bet you haven't changed at all.

120
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,040
Pretty much know how
did you navigate that?

121
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,270
That's a very friends,

122
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,270
those dudes like those days
that I was like kitten,

123
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,521
the bell,

124
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:11,390
like they don't want it do the
show and that is that they,

125
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,370
they really don't want it.

126
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,581
I mean,

127
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:13,540
not really like Kevin,

128
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,261
we don't want to do this,

129
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,190
but Walter is just like,

130
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,053
Oh man,

131
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,190
they just grounded you so much.

132
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:21,070
You never gave into the
tide of those two craziness.

133
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:21,850
I've got friends.

134
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,121
I mean,

135
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:26,440
I've never had butch friends who like
fucking punch you and wrestle lunch called

136
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:27,274
butch.

137
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,770
I mean it is to a fake dude like me.

138
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:30,371
That's Bush,

139
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:30,700
Dude.

140
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,533
Those are bullies.

141
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,190
But like the hard Boyz is,

142
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:34,540
my mom used to say it was good.

143
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,100
We'll leave those hardy boys alone.

144
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:36,934
Kevin,

145
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,791
I never had,

146
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,780
I didn't have the rough house playing
around like let's wrestle and shit like

147
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:41,140
that.

148
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,450
What I had was more psychological,

149
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:44,320
more oral,

150
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,190
and that sounds dirty,

151
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,060
but I don't mean oral.

152
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,310
More like the dozens.

153
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,540
Motherfuckers keeping it tight.

154
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,380
You grow up fat,

155
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,270
you gotta be fucking sharp.

156
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:55,300
Stand your toes or else you're a fucking
victim every time you walk in the room,

157
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,800
because most of the world
don't look like you.

158
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,150
So you get sharp.

159
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:02,860
You learn how to fucking take yourself
out first before anybody else can steal

160
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:03,430
their thunder.

161
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:03,671
Hey,

162
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:04,481
I'm fucking fat.

163
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:05,314
And then people are like,

164
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:05,740
oh,

165
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,280
you know,

166
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,581
you know,

167
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,320
and then there you've
removed their fucking card.

168
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:11,830
He'd taken their biggest weapon out of
their quiver to biggest thing they got

169
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:14,680
and then suddenly you've
changed the focus and hey,

170
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:15,820
he's easy with himself,

171
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:15,971
blah,

172
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:16,151
blah,

173
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:16,630
blah.

174
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,780
And it makes people allegiant,

175
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:17,951
you know,

176
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:20,170
just all that shit you
pick up over the years,

177
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,660
you see it.

178
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,071
It's,

179
00:04:22,071 --> 00:04:23,020
it's what shapes you.

180
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:24,340
It's what makes you who you are.

181
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:29,341
So being able to hang out with people
who were quick enough to like shred you,

182
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,140
but you had to be able to
protect yourself and funny.

183
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:35,140
And it's like hanging out with Ninjas
all the time who just or not in India so

184
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:38,890
much as Keto from the old pink panther
movies were just hired them to literally

185
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:40,150
attack him out of nowhere.

186
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,410
That's what your friends do.

187
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,420
They just like attack you
out of fucking nowhere.

188
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,630
And so by doing this all the time,

189
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,720
it made me sharp,

190
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,100
but it also kept me very,

191
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:48,934
very real.

192
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,691
So these cats,

193
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:51,100
even when the movies would take off,

194
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:52,720
where were I was doing
this one or this one,

195
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,010
they were never like,

196
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,120
oh my God,

197
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:55,954
the fucking,

198
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,970
we had no idea you were hidden genius.

199
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,950
They remain the same exact individuals.

200
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,600
So I didn't like that one.

201
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,400
Oh fuck yes.

202
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:02,760
Really?

203
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,190
Yes.

204
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,023
Oh yes.

205
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,840
In a heartbeat.

206
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,411
In a heartbeat.

207
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:07,270
They'll let you know and they'll let you,

208
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:08,490
like I brought them on a mall,

209
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:11,290
rats to come work on the movie
and stuff and they made it,

210
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,200
they were in it in a few scenes
but they worked behind the scenes.

211
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:16,390
They quit after about two
weeks cause they're just like,

212
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,471
I don't want to do this.

213
00:05:17,471 --> 00:05:18,550
I have no interest in this.

214
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:19,541
I mean,

215
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:20,051
and that's cool.

216
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:20,861
Like I respected that.

217
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:23,170
I was like [inaudible] that's Brian.

218
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:23,741
That's Walter.

219
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,150
Like that's who they are.

220
00:05:25,151 --> 00:05:25,961
Rather than be like,

221
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:26,471
all right man,

222
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:30,010
we're going to do it because
it might upset Kev if we don't.

223
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:30,640
They're just like,

224
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,900
oh we don't want to do this dude.

225
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,790
What makes the Dyno self kind of thing?

226
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,610
I'm sorry,

227
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,940
what makes you think that without
them you wouldn't be you though?

228
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,000
What makes you think that without them
you wouldn't have pulled yourself to the

229
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:40,450
ground?

230
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,010
I wouldn't have had that sense of humor.

231
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:44,480
I think my sense of humor
largely came from them,

232
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:49,510
largely came from my friend Brian Johnson
and Walter also kind of shaped it to

233
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:50,614
some degree.

234
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:50,981
I was,

235
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:51,190
I've,

236
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:51,860
I was funny,

237
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,631
like don't get me wrong.

238
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:52,721
And,

239
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:56,140
and high in high school I write sketches
for the comedy shows and Shit like

240
00:05:56,141 --> 00:05:56,830
that.

241
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:01,830
But I there it was their sensibility
married to whatever sensibility I had is

242
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,590
one of three kids,

243
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:05,720
raised Catholic and highlands New Jersey.

244
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,920
That clicked that like kind
of made me the version of me,

245
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:10,221
you know,

246
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:14,690
the person that you would want to meet
or the person like that was different was

247
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:16,280
like Kev 18 years old,

248
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:17,240
1718,

249
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:19,520
before we started hanging
out with Brian and Walter.

250
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,240
Um,

251
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,030
those were the cats that kind
of helped me define who I was.

252
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:28,010
And if you look at clerks like that
movie is [inaudible] Dante and my friend

253
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:30,290
Brian Johnson has meant to be Randall.

254
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,210
The guy that I most wanted to be like,

255
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:32,511
he knew,

256
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:35,630
always knew what to say was fucking
funny in a room and shit like that.

257
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,060
Really misanthropic and stuff.

258
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,140
And so that it kind of all communicated
without those cats that I don't think I

259
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:45,050
know I wouldn't have the jobs I've had
cause I wouldn't have the sense of humor

260
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:45,884
I have now.

261
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,870
And I don't think I'd be if,

262
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:49,660
let's say I got into
entertainment somehow,

263
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,020
I doubt I'd be as grounded.

264
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,810
Knowing those dudes have kept
me kind of grounded for years.

265
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,520
That's pretty cool man.

266
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:55,970
It's good.

267
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,620
It's good to have something
like that and your life,

268
00:06:57,621 --> 00:06:57,970
man.

269
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:58,140
Well,

270
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,690
I have any similar can weed,

271
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:00,501
why aren't you smoking weed?

272
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:01,760
I thought this is a weed show.

273
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,940
We already got high and

274
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,460
let's get higher

275
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,290
experiencing it.

276
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,950
Hire Kevin just gave me a heart
attack and he did his even realize it.

277
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,510
What way?

278
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,343
What way?

279
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,070
By talking about all that life thing.

280
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:18,310
I almost died a Friday night when I,

281
00:07:18,311 --> 00:07:18,940
uh,

282
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,541
was out.

283
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,440
And you just told me,

284
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:21,274
and I'm like,

285
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,330
uh,

286
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,240
I was at a karaoke bar in Burbank
right across the street from a,

287
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,140
the Jay Leno show,

288
00:07:26,141 --> 00:07:28,570
like the NBC building temples.

289
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,261
I've see,

290
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:29,471
I've,

291
00:07:29,471 --> 00:07:29,681
see,

292
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:30,640
I drive past that.

293
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:31,480
I've seen that place.

294
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,350
I came out,

295
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,980
me and my girlfriend around 1130 when
we walking out the front and we parked.

296
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:37,690
So I'm opening the door for her to get in.

297
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,950
I have no where this big,

298
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:40,000
tall black guy,

299
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,080
about six to wearing a fake gray beard,

300
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,930
like a Santa Claus beard that was like
tied on with white strings and a hat in

301
00:07:46,931 --> 00:07:50,860
this big Hobo jacket shows a
gun in my chest and was like,

302
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,120
give me your fucking wallet.

303
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,691
Oh man,

304
00:07:52,691 --> 00:07:53,141
you're harsher.

305
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:53,680
My boss.

306
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,260
Yeah,

307
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:54,880
nevermind.

308
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,713
Keep going.

309
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,810
And then my girlfriend was,

310
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,520
my girlfriend was pretty drunk.

311
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,281
That's good.

312
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:03,461
Here's,

313
00:08:03,461 --> 00:08:04,630
my girlfriend was pretty drunk,

314
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:07,000
so because she has like social anxiety,

315
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:07,631
so she drinks,

316
00:08:07,631 --> 00:08:07,840
you know,

317
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,673
when she goes out,

318
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,390
she thought it was a joke.

319
00:08:10,391 --> 00:08:12,760
She looked over and thought this
was like a character or something.

320
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:13,660
Right.

321
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,471
And so he's like,

322
00:08:14,471 --> 00:08:14,981
give a shit,

323
00:08:14,981 --> 00:08:15,860
you're shaking telling him,

324
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,930
you can tell it's still fun.

325
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,320
Yeah.

326
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,830
Fucking night,

327
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,581
I would fuck me up,

328
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,061
keep going.

329
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:19,780
And so he said,

330
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,110
uh,

331
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:20,651
he said,

332
00:08:20,651 --> 00:08:21,370
um,

333
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:21,611
you know,

334
00:08:21,611 --> 00:08:23,080
give me your fucking purse bitch.

335
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,830
And she just like,

336
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,631
like looking at him,

337
00:08:24,631 --> 00:08:25,690
like what?

338
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,150
Like she was drunk and
shocked and I'm like,

339
00:08:28,151 --> 00:08:28,450
give her,

340
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,201
give him the person.

341
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:31,900
So I get gave her or she gave
him the purse and then he goes,

342
00:08:31,901 --> 00:08:32,740
get in the car,

343
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,120
lay on your fucking stomach.

344
00:08:34,121 --> 00:08:36,700
And he's shoving the gun in my
back while I'm laying in the car.

345
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,391
And I'm thinking like,

346
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:37,601
all right,

347
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,010
this is like execution style.

348
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:39,791
Like he's telling me to,

349
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:40,060
you know,

350
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,740
get in there and then suddenly he goes,

351
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:42,680
get laid down to the,

352
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:43,511
to my girlfriend.

353
00:08:43,511 --> 00:08:46,630
And she laid down on her back
because she was just so freaked out.

354
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,230
He said,

355
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,180
I said later on your
fucking stomach bitch.

356
00:08:49,181 --> 00:08:49,571
And he's like,

357
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,520
she's shoving a gun in her back.

358
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:55,060
And then finally we just like both laying
there and then he slams the door and

359
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,153
just takes off.

360
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,300
And so now,

361
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,330
like the other day I was at the grocery
store and I saw a black guy that was

362
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,100
tall and I'm now I'm
like freaking out like,

363
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:04,560
and if it was a red head that robbed
me would have been the same way.

364
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,160
But now I see these guys and I'm like
becoming like a racist from the 50s now

365
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:08,851
where I'm like walking around,

366
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:09,090
I'm like,

367
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,740
what's he doing on my side of the store?

368
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,101
You know,

369
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:12,560
like it's crazy.

370
00:09:12,561 --> 00:09:14,490
It's like at this point you had your,

371
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,990
you were in that moment.

372
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,003
Yeah.

373
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,701
What did you,

374
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:18,630
what was it like?

375
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,210
It was really when I was
laying there and it was like,

376
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:21,751
this is it.

377
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:23,520
And but you think that they think,

378
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,211
what did you think?

379
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:24,481
You know,

380
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,520
I didn't think about anything
except my girlfriend the whole time.

381
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:26,880
And I'm like,

382
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,100
cause hearing him yell at her,

383
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,560
that's just you.

384
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,300
You think that you can just kind of
look around and look for a weapon or

385
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:33,841
something like that.

386
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:35,520
But when you're in that biggest shock,

387
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:36,180
you're just like,

388
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:36,331
oh,

389
00:09:36,331 --> 00:09:37,400
I wouldn't look to fence lines.

390
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,710
So not the butch dude.

391
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,451
That's again,

392
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:40,920
there's a word I'm showing up.

393
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:41,731
The dude that's like,

394
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:42,391
where's a weapon?

395
00:09:42,391 --> 00:09:43,224
I'm going to do this.

396
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,281
My immediate,

397
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:45,630
my reaction is going to be like,

398
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,710
let me suck your Dick.

399
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,520
Let us go.

400
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,530
I will suck your Dick until
you let us go and he's like,

401
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:50,550
you've got a girlfriend.

402
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:50,821
I'm like,

403
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:51,480
still,

404
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,590
I'll be better than her.

405
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,010
Yeah,

406
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,090
I can really deliver.

407
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:54,181
I,

408
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:55,210
that's where I go with,

409
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,420
I would never go defensive or offensive.

410
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,291
All these people in line,

411
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:58,771
of course it's like,

412
00:09:58,771 --> 00:09:58,921
Doug,

413
00:09:58,921 --> 00:10:00,520
what'd you get for not doing Jujitsu?

414
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,060
Like if I had two guns in my pocket,

415
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,100
I still was doing it,

416
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:04,861
but fuck yeah.

417
00:10:04,861 --> 00:10:07,110
I mean if you add yourself
strapped the dynamite,

418
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:08,100
maybe then you could be a little,

419
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:09,000
look at this bitch,

420
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:10,260
right people,

421
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,730
those you should have.

422
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:13,260
People should shut the fuck up.

423
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,640
No one knows what that's like until that
happens to you and you should always

424
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:18,750
give someone what they want.

425
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,000
Usually they just want to fucking
get your money and run away.

426
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:21,840
They don't want to shoot you.

427
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,830
Is that the case?

428
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,840
Usually you hear at
once in a while though,

429
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:25,310
like,

430
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,280
like Old Lady,

431
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,530
you know,

432
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,710
did nothing still gets shot
or something like that.

433
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,920
If it's a young kid on fucking PCP,

434
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,173
it's really a gamble.

435
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,180
This is a birthday and then time where
you believing about midnight and three

436
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,990
months before that or six months before
that I was in Fuddrucker's in Burbank

437
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,870
and some guys like stealing this girl's
person running out the door and I'm

438
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:46,471
chasing him.

439
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:47,010
I'm like,

440
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,210
I'm in Burbank right now.

441
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:48,710
Why?

442
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,543
You know,

443
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,970
and we talked about,

444
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:51,300
uh,

445
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,670
the Kmart shooting in one podcast,

446
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:53,881
the,

447
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:54,280
the,

448
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:54,751
the,

449
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:59,400
there was a shooting at Kmart in Burbank
and the officer that got shot was the

450
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:02,280
one that came to rescue
me when the other night.

451
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,150
And I was like,

452
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:03,780
you're the,

453
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,620
you're the one officer.

454
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:04,921
And he's like,

455
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:05,281
yeah,

456
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:05,551
he got,

457
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:08,550
he got shot in the leg
and stuff like that.

458
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,400
And so he became like a
celebrity guy because,

459
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,340
well he's been shot at in Burbank and,

460
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,610
and Kmarts like,

461
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,560
you know,

462
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,800
makes saw him on TV.

463
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,430
But it's like,

464
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:19,861
it's like,

465
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:23,570
it seems like you always hear Burbank
is so safe and stuff you don't think at

466
00:11:23,571 --> 00:11:25,620
Burbank is like Bob and lived there.

467
00:11:25,621 --> 00:11:27,580
How could it be right
there could be no terror.

468
00:11:27,581 --> 00:11:27,840
Well,

469
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,560
liquid lake.

470
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,240
I wonder how many checks one of bone,

471
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:31,340
that guy because he,

472
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,090
the celebrity cop that got shot.

473
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,530
Well I had to wait a bunch.

474
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:34,950
Right.

475
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,783
Gotta be right.

476
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,440
There are checks that
doesn't fuck fat dude.

477
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:41,220
You gotta be checks that
wanna fuck fucking a hero cop.

478
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,750
He wrote cop that got shot in the leg.

479
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:46,430
I bet that guy gets beaten off the
pussy just waiting for forensics.

480
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,230
Like I had to wait like four hours
because I mean this is like the closed off

481
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:50,180
helicopters and everything.

482
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,590
That was like cops and stuff and
then they wanted a fingerprint,

483
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:54,011
my car.

484
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:57,580
So I'm just sitting there and he's
like going ask him my girlfriend like

485
00:11:57,581 --> 00:11:59,110
questions like weird questions like,

486
00:11:59,111 --> 00:11:59,890
so what do you do?

487
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:00,041
Oh,

488
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:00,620
you're dance.

489
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,090
Uh Huh.

490
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:01,241
Yeah.

491
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:03,190
Well you look like you ain't and
stuff like it was a computer.

492
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:04,120
No,

493
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,440
he was totally an awesome,

494
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:05,951
nice cop.

495
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:08,720
But it was kind of weird like hearing
like my girlfriend having to talk like,

496
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,130
yeah,

497
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,240
it was an exotic dancer.

498
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:10,750
No,

499
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,150
but just asking weird questions.

500
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,800
And then was he going as close to hitting
on her as he could and still remaining

501
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:17,380
a cop?

502
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,570
Was he doing like with this guy?

503
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:19,990
Yeah,

504
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,823
he was,

505
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,720
I don't know.

506
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,170
You see me and they see my girlfriend.

507
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,160
Maybe he thought I was like paid for her,

508
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:28,510
like if she was a hooker or something,

509
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:29,220
you know,

510
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,220
like how long do you know this guy you
gotta like he said exactly in Brian Flux,

511
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:36,364
we'll reserve.

512
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,030
But,

513
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,900
but what's weird is,

514
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,520
I don't even know what it was weird.

515
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:39,701
Oh,

516
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:40,211
but we're just,

517
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:42,250
when he was talking to me and asked
me all these questions and he goes,

518
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:42,640
well,

519
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,121
and I was like,

520
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:43,331
yeah,

521
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:44,111
I would like to be a cop,

522
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:45,580
but I like marijuana too much.

523
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:45,881
And he goes,

524
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:46,240
yeah,

525
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,800
I see that.

526
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,000
Yeah,

527
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,230
you know,

528
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:47,830
marijuana.

529
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,251
And he's like,

530
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:49,031
it's going to be legal soon,

531
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:49,864
so don't worry about that.

532
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,200
And I was like,

533
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,590
all right,

534
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,900
this cough is Korea.

535
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:55,000
I don't know if he's got
a fucking crystal ball.

536
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:55,923
Yeah,

537
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,741
come on man.

538
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:57,200
Come on.

539
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,600
And that was the only silver lining to
that horrible story was like at the end

540
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:01,871
of it,

541
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:02,651
the cop was like,

542
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:03,311
don't worry kid.

543
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:04,130
One day we,

544
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,460
it's going to be lean now
I'm scared of black wizards.

545
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,713
Wizards.

546
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,473
I'm going to be,

547
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,230
Halloween are going to
be one black wizard.

548
00:13:11,231 --> 00:13:13,780
It's going to tack it onto the
Spring Mass at any be an internet.

549
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:14,561
Me and my friend,

550
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:16,560
black wizard wizard.

551
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,850
You're scared of monsters.

552
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:20,380
You know like where I
was smoking my strike.

553
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,700
Let's get a werewolves,

554
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:22,060
bro.

555
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,120
I love you were a little stir.

556
00:13:23,121 --> 00:13:25,420
Now I'm scared of Jaguars and pants.

557
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,340
Did you find the monsters or the video?

558
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:30,130
I tweeted the other day of a
Jaguar killing a fucking crocodile.

559
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,290
Somebody tweeted it to
me and I retweeted it.

560
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,870
It's a Jaguar killing a fucking crocodile.

561
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,390
How scary are Jaguars?

562
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,710
I don't think there's a crocodile in
the reference you've made to a Jaguar.

563
00:13:41,711 --> 00:13:42,800
You they do care.

564
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,330
Care led Zepplin and big cats.

565
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,720
The cats to me.

566
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,051
Yeah.

567
00:13:47,051 --> 00:13:47,351
Well,

568
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:48,160
not here,

569
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,701
unfortunately,

570
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:50,230
but there are pumas in this neighborhood.

571
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:50,650
Really?

572
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:50,951
Oh yeah.

573
00:13:50,951 --> 00:13:51,700
For Real.

574
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:51,881
Yeah.

575
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:52,691
Whenever we see deer,

576
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:54,340
this deer in this neighborhood
and there's pumas.

577
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:54,791
All right,

578
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:55,450
so there's two.

579
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,850
It's not stay out of this one at Burbank.

580
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,570
It's not uncommon that people have spotted
them in this community several times.

581
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,493
Really?

582
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,490
Like mountain cats.

583
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:04,460
I mean there's there,

584
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:09,070
there's a known population of them that
live like around Topanga Canyon in this

585
00:14:09,071 --> 00:14:10,590
area and they travel really far.

586
00:14:10,591 --> 00:14:11,261
Like one of them,

587
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:13,930
they tracked from South Dakota
all the way to Connecticut.

588
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,173
They get hit,

589
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,290
he got hit by a car and Connecticut.

590
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,550
And they had decided,

591
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,140
I saw this.

592
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:19,480
Yeah,

593
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,400
they did the DNA test on this fucker
and they found out that it's from South

594
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:24,640
Dakota.

595
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,160
So this is from a group of
genetics from South Dakota.

596
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:29,140
This thing had walked 1800 miles.

597
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,840
He was looking for sugar
to put in this to a lump.

598
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,071
Ooh.

599
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:32,904
Three or,

600
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,600
or a dog or two eating some
nice plump dogs along the way.

601
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,820
They do downing months.

602
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,680
All right man.

603
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:47,440
Let's change up the topic
cause you're scaring me now.

604
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,590
Now I don't want to go out to my car and
this neighborhood and I don't want to

605
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,190
watch the video of the Jaguar killing
a crocodile cause it's fucking amazing

606
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:58,280
because you think you look at a crocodile
and you look at that as a God damn

607
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,440
dinosaur designers,

608
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,283
farmer,

609
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,850
evil lizard.

610
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,531
Like what?

611
00:15:02,531 --> 00:15:03,590
Who would fuck with that?

612
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,491
And the Jaguar,

613
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:06,420
it's just like playful
with this fucking crock.

614
00:15:06,421 --> 00:15:08,210
And I like knows it's going to kill it.

615
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,381
Just playing with it.

616
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:11,120
Swats added pause at it.

617
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,530
Just looks for the right moment,

618
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,500
get sideways on it and then
right behind the fucking head.

619
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:16,880
It's crazy.

620
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:17,750
It's like what?

621
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:17,950
Uh,

622
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:18,410
if,

623
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:23,410
if they're not scared of Croghan miles
now do we have the US fleshy bags of

624
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:24,550
pink,

625
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,290
you know,

626
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,630
these big black,

627
00:15:26,631 --> 00:15:27,410
muscular,

628
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,670
evil looking cats

629
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,690
in a world where you been following
up on a wildlife tech stores.

630
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,780
You've been seeing all the bear stories
like the two bears in Yellowstone this

631
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:36,840
year,

632
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,673
the Animal Beers,

633
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,650
two guys who've been killed by
bears in Yellowstone this year.

634
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,000
It's rare you read that story online
about the kid who got bit by a polar bear.

635
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,630
Yeah.

636
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,640
That was fucking astounding.

637
00:15:47,641 --> 00:15:51,420
The dude literally tells a story
where him and his trooper on,

638
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:51,960
you know,

639
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,000
they're out in the fucking
woods or something like that.

640
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,860
And there's a kid sleeping next to him,

641
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,870
a sleep in a tent.

642
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,350
And this polar bear comes
fucking through the tent.

643
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,870
The kid woke up to like wailing and
gnashing of teeth and the fucking thing,

644
00:16:03,871 --> 00:16:08,871
ground and blood all over its face
and the thing bid him on the head,

645
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:13,710
had his head in its mouth of polar
bear had his kids had in his mouth.

646
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,700
And he said,

647
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,320
it bits so hard,

648
00:16:16,321 --> 00:16:20,820
they cracked his fucking skull
and he heard it crack in his head.

649
00:16:20,821 --> 00:16:22,530
And what he also heard in his head,

650
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,670
louder than life,

651
00:16:23,671 --> 00:16:28,671
sense around style from
the 70s was growlin because
it's fucking mouth was over

652
00:16:30,721 --> 00:16:31,554
his ears.

653
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,610
And he starts punching this
fucking beast in the head,

654
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,511
punching it,

655
00:16:36,511 --> 00:16:37,950
and they had real hard and shit.

656
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,060
And finally let's go enough for him to
like make a move or something like that.

657
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,260
So He's,

658
00:16:43,261 --> 00:16:44,550
he survived the body.

659
00:16:44,551 --> 00:16:48,090
His body was right next to him died
and they interviewed the kid and he's

660
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:48,571
talking about,

661
00:16:48,571 --> 00:16:48,781
he's like,

662
00:16:48,781 --> 00:16:49,920
I got a lot of guilt man.

663
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:53,790
Like it could have been me if I'd
slept on that side I'd be dead.

664
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,051
But I'm like,

665
00:16:55,051 --> 00:16:55,321
dude,

666
00:16:55,321 --> 00:16:56,910
you got your head bit by a polar bear.

667
00:16:56,911 --> 00:16:57,180
That's,

668
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,230
I'm not going to say it's worse,

669
00:16:58,231 --> 00:16:59,100
but that's pretty damn.

670
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,810
So he got away and it just
went after his friend next.

671
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,040
No,

672
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,150
his friend was done for,

673
00:17:03,151 --> 00:17:04,560
by the time the kid woke up,

674
00:17:04,561 --> 00:17:06,390
the polar bear had taken what it wanted,

675
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:07,224
I think from the,

676
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,410
his friend did Malta
instantly it says face.

677
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,790
Oh my God.

678
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,361
Yeah man.

679
00:17:12,361 --> 00:17:12,781
Nature.

680
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:13,540
What do you think it is?

681
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,770
You think it's like they're hungry and
a weather condition changes and they're

682
00:17:16,771 --> 00:17:18,420
just coming into the neighborhoods now.

683
00:17:18,421 --> 00:17:20,850
Cause you don't hear a lot
about this back in the day,

684
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,620
but a lot of it happening now.

685
00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:24,030
A lot of more shark attacks,

686
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,650
lot more bear attacks.

687
00:17:25,651 --> 00:17:27,300
Maybe the really true statistically,

688
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,200
well I'm asking,

689
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:28,981
I know know more.

690
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:29,581
Maybe it's just,

691
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:30,720
I'm reading more about it.

692
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:31,051
Well,

693
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,820
where we have more access to information.

694
00:17:32,821 --> 00:17:35,850
I do know that they said with this yellow
stone attack to the last time there

695
00:17:35,851 --> 00:17:37,950
had been a death from
bears and Yellowstones.

696
00:17:37,951 --> 00:17:39,840
It was an [inaudible] 86 yeah.

697
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,201
Yeah.

698
00:17:40,201 --> 00:17:41,540
So that's a long time man.

699
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:41,731
I mean,

700
00:17:41,731 --> 00:17:42,370
Shit,

701
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,140
you know,

702
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,080
that's a long ass time for nothing,

703
00:17:46,081 --> 00:17:46,920
nothing to get killed.

704
00:17:46,921 --> 00:17:48,810
And then all of a sudden two
people get killed quickly.

705
00:17:48,811 --> 00:17:52,620
But those two people could have been
sprinkled any time along the way.

706
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:52,801
It's,

707
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:53,790
you're in the wrong place.

708
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:54,541
The wrong time.

709
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,070
You Zig when you should have zagged.

710
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,390
It didn't rain enough.

711
00:17:57,391 --> 00:18:00,990
So the fucking is not enough food and
then all sudden bear start eating other

712
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:01,470
things.

713
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,760
Bears are omnivores.

714
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:04,260
That's the crazy thing about them.

715
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:05,760
They can eat whatever the fuck they want.

716
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:06,600
So it's like us.

717
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,130
But the terrible thing about bears is
because they're not strict carnivores.

718
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,770
They don't kill their
prey before they eat it.

719
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,600
They just start eating as I'm going to
stand for a bit and I just don't want the

720
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:19,740
camera looking at my Dick.

721
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:20,574
The whole,

722
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,100
we could all stand.

723
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:23,581
No,

724
00:18:23,581 --> 00:18:24,430
I just want to stress.

725
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:24,600
No,

726
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:24,781
no,

727
00:18:24,781 --> 00:18:25,560
I'm all good.

728
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,680
How long do I stand for the cop
not wait till it gets awkward

729
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,420
and then I'll kick back down.

730
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,000
Dear balls ever fall asleep from sitting
too much like I've lately I think I've

731
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:39,180
been sitting a certain way
where it squeezes the blood
blood pressure off on one

732
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:41,910
of my balls and then it feels
like my whole crutches a numb.

733
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,710
That's the inevitable progression to you.

734
00:18:43,711 --> 00:18:44,550
Growing a vagina.

735
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:45,384
It was going to happen.

736
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,300
What happened?

737
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,010
Balls are gonna,

738
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:50,250
they're gonna melt
together and then pop open.

739
00:18:50,251 --> 00:18:54,270
Like you remember that scene and John
Carpenter's the thing where the chest

740
00:18:54,271 --> 00:18:56,130
cavity opens up and becomes a big mouth.

741
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:56,340
Yeah.

742
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,200
That's going to be your
new book comes off.

743
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,190
That's your new pussy.

744
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,350
No,

745
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:01,711
my balls.

746
00:19:01,711 --> 00:19:02,251
I'll fall asleep.

747
00:19:02,251 --> 00:19:02,640
Usually.

748
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,930
Never have you never had that happen.

749
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,280
It's such a weird feeling.

750
00:19:05,281 --> 00:19:05,491
No,

751
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:06,570
but my good.

752
00:19:06,571 --> 00:19:07,141
Should I try it?

753
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:07,351
No,

754
00:19:07,351 --> 00:19:07,811
it's horrible.

755
00:19:07,811 --> 00:19:10,440
I do the Ari Shaffir sometimes
though when I'm reading a,

756
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:10,681
you know,

757
00:19:10,681 --> 00:19:11,550
he has a joke about,

758
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:11,730
uh,

759
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:15,600
taking a shit and his leg go numb and
you'd get off and fall down to the ground.

760
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,060
I read magazines all
the time and the toilet,

761
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:18,631
and you do,

762
00:19:18,631 --> 00:19:19,560
if you read magazines,

763
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:20,311
you're essentially,

764
00:19:20,311 --> 00:19:21,390
you're choking out your leg.

765
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,920
That's why Jiu Jitsu works.

766
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,340
Jiu Jitsu works cause he cut off the
blood and what you're doing when your feet

767
00:19:26,341 --> 00:19:28,770
go numb is you're putting all this
pressure on yourself and wait,

768
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:28,931
you're,

769
00:19:28,931 --> 00:19:30,480
you're essentially choking out your legs.

770
00:19:30,481 --> 00:19:31,314
You're making hemorrhoids.

771
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,370
That's what it is.

772
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,720
Yeah.

773
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:32,951
Yeah.

774
00:19:32,951 --> 00:19:33,151
And when,

775
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:35,520
when you choke someone
out in a Jujitsu choke,

776
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:37,800
what you're doing is you're
stopping the blood to their brain.

777
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,790
You're cutting it off,

778
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,830
stopping it from
happening at squeezing it.

779
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,840
And that's what you're doing when
you're sitting here on the toilet.

780
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:46,080
If you have this hard surface beneath
your leg and then you're on top of your

781
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:46,290
leg,

782
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,870
you're basically giving
your feet a slow choke.

783
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:49,591
Oh my God,

784
00:19:49,591 --> 00:19:50,220
Dude.

785
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,053
All right.

786
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,620
I do this all the time.

787
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,160
I do too.

788
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,080
I sit on the toilet for so long.

789
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,220
When I get up,

790
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:01,290
I got pins and needles and I can't walk
the hall and then like sometimes I'll

791
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,700
try to man up and get through it,

792
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,910
but by the time I hit the bedroom like
you start laughing because it's so you're

793
00:20:07,981 --> 00:20:10,980
out of control because the nerve is
are all dead and my wife's just like,

794
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,050
how long when you get to learn,

795
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,700
like you go in your shit,

796
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:15,534
you get out.

797
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:19,020
Like why aren't you staying in there
till your fucking leg falls asleep?

798
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:19,951
And I was like,

799
00:20:19,951 --> 00:20:21,150
cause I'm getting shit done.

800
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,061
But I,

801
00:20:22,061 --> 00:20:22,380
it's,

802
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,670
I guess that's unhealthy.

803
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,350
I read car magazines.

804
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,250
Is that what you do?

805
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,120
I go on the Internet.

806
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,310
It's the only time I read car magazines.

807
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:29,591
I don't,

808
00:20:29,591 --> 00:20:31,710
I won't let myself go in
the Internet in the toilet.

809
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:32,790
That's where it gets ridiculous.

810
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:33,271
I'm like,

811
00:20:33,271 --> 00:20:35,610
I'm down to the occasional
magazine at least.

812
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:36,301
Let me finish up.

813
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:41,301
Matt Taibbi Rolling Stone article in
here on the crapper do wipe sitting up or

814
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:43,140
sitting down.

815
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,250
What the fuck you mean stand who you,

816
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,680
I've never done that.

817
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,800
You never stand in wiped up?

818
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,220
Only

819
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,060
when I was a kid.

820
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:49,960
And this is weird.

821
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:50,520
Wow.

822
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:50,870
All right.

823
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:51,820
You're getting something out of me.

824
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:53,230
I've haven't said publicly.

825
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:55,360
It may be ever when I was a kid,

826
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:56,441
I remember,

827
00:20:56,441 --> 00:20:56,800
uh,

828
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,210
like I take a shit,

829
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,270
I'm trying to remember
what age the stopped,

830
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,091
but I'd be like,

831
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:01,720
I'm done.

832
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,740
And somebody would get up,

833
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,820
he'd stand up and they'd
wipe your ass for you.

834
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:06,880
And I think I did that
till I was like seven,

835
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,870
which is weird.

836
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,680
It is weird.

837
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,130
Yeah.

838
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,090
But it was pretty good.

839
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,200
Like in terms of like,

840
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:14,950
I didn't really have to figure out how
to fucking wipe my own shit for until

841
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:15,784
that point.

842
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,390
And then you had to train yourself
to do it from sitting down.

843
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:23,320
I think it's an ever perfected and ever
perfecting art form the art of the wipe.

844
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:24,040
It's not,

845
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,341
you know,

846
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:26,290
there's no one true measure and,

847
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,020
and I think it develops as you get older,

848
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,760
you learn better technique and stuff.

849
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,660
But um,

850
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,290
no,

851
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,041
not since then.

852
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:33,720
I've never stent,

853
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,500
I'm a more of a front wiper though.

854
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:36,970
Like I'll reach,

855
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,620
cause I got a lot of back fat.

856
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,970
Rather than reach around,

857
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,770
I'll reach through my lean
forward and reach through my legs.

858
00:21:42,771 --> 00:21:45,130
So I'm wiping almost like my man puss,

859
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,280
but I clear the ball so it doesn't
hit my balls or anything like that.

860
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,770
Fascinating.

861
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,510
You walked away.

862
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,670
The wet wipes have really helped my life.

863
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,630
They just come out of nowhere.

864
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:55,921
It couldn't.

865
00:21:55,921 --> 00:21:57,240
They have those in the 70 [inaudible]

866
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,090
will Smith was the first one
that called them to my potential.

867
00:22:00,091 --> 00:22:01,300
I mean they had baby wipes forever,

868
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:04,440
but these flushables asshole
cleaning of fishing out.

869
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:04,810
Yeah.

870
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,880
Big Time Man.

871
00:22:05,881 --> 00:22:08,990
He talks about it and he did.

872
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,320
He literally talks about an interview.

873
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:15,240
He was just like Barry Barry Sonnenfeld
on men and black turned me on to wet

874
00:22:15,241 --> 00:22:16,680
wipes for handy wipes for,

875
00:22:16,681 --> 00:22:17,101
for going.

876
00:22:17,101 --> 00:22:17,491
And he's like,

877
00:22:17,491 --> 00:22:19,890
why would you use toilet
paper when you can use this?

878
00:22:19,891 --> 00:22:20,251
And he's like,

879
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:21,300
I haven't gone back since.

880
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,040
And so one day I went out and got a pack.

881
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:23,281
I was like,

882
00:22:23,281 --> 00:22:24,540
this is fucking amazing.

883
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:25,141
It's like taking a,

884
00:22:25,141 --> 00:22:26,040
she flushed them,

885
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,980
but these are flushable so you can
at least say they're pleasurable.

886
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:29,920
Let me tell you what happens.

887
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:30,450
I,

888
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,800
I've used it for years and never had it

889
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:34,330
problem.

890
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,300
You were probably about to,

891
00:22:35,301 --> 00:22:35,920
I had a set

892
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,250
problem with what not.

893
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,060
I had a,

894
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,890
I had a tree growing inside my,

895
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,580
my pipe here.

896
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,261
Oh Dude.

897
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:43,550
It was the most ridiculous thing.

898
00:22:43,551 --> 00:22:44,384
I tweeted it.

899
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,660
It's almost impossible
to find now someone,

900
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,421
someone on the Internet,

901
00:22:47,421 --> 00:22:48,080
I'll find it,

902
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,790
but it's a,

903
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,550
uh,

904
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,450
literally there was a branch
growing like it was huge.

905
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:55,670
It's crazy root system and everything
that was growing in my toilet,

906
00:22:55,671 --> 00:22:57,290
I kept having this clogged up toilet.

907
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,900
Didn't matter if I port draino
on it and nothing would work.

908
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,280
So I had these guys come over.

909
00:23:01,281 --> 00:23:02,660
I figured they just going
to snake the toilet.

910
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:07,250
Will they cut out a fucking tree because
nature is such a motherfucker that a

911
00:23:07,251 --> 00:23:12,251
tiny crack had grown in one of the pipes
and these a route from one of the low,

912
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,630
the nearby trees had forced its way
into this and found out that there's all

913
00:23:17,631 --> 00:23:19,070
this water in this area.

914
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,080
So spread apart the pipe by
growing and then grew up the pipe.

915
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,070
It's incredible.

916
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:30,070
It was just an invasion by this plant
species living off my poop and it was all

917
00:23:30,621 --> 00:23:34,220
clogged up with those little
fucking flushable wipes,

918
00:23:34,221 --> 00:23:35,054
those flushable wipes.

919
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,550
You know how the flushable wipe comes
in like that little treasure chest,

920
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,710
you can just get like refill
it and throw it in there.

921
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:45,410
I don't do that for that long because
if you look at like the taint or the

922
00:23:45,411 --> 00:23:46,070
button of

923
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,770
the thing,

924
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:50,120
you know sometimes if you had a second
wife you might have a little poo on your

925
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:51,050
hand and that builds up.

926
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,090
If you smell that it
smells like an asshole.

927
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,430
I never used the button bring,

928
00:23:55,431 --> 00:23:58,880
I just open it and draw them
out for that very reason.

929
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:00,490
I don't want to touch cool button ever.

930
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:00,770
Yeah.

931
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:01,491
What's up with that,

932
00:24:01,491 --> 00:24:01,671
right?

933
00:24:01,671 --> 00:24:01,800
Yeah.

934
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,230
Poobah that's a silly move.

935
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,450
Did they give you a rubber
glove to use that thing was,

936
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,390
that's what they should follow
because you give you a rubber glove.

937
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,733
That should be what?

938
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,530
The wipe to the deep sincere.

939
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:13,100
I'll take them.

940
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,920
I'll go knuckle deep to why when
you're cleaning yourself out.

941
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:16,963
Exactly.

942
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:17,601
You never know.

943
00:24:17,601 --> 00:24:18,351
If somebody gonna be like,

944
00:24:18,351 --> 00:24:19,730
tonight's the night I might eat your ass.

945
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,680
So people are so funny about assholes.

946
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,620
No real.

947
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,970
Are these people uncomfortable about it?

948
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,250
Don't like you talking about your own.

949
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,020
Just like certain things
you can talk about.

950
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,500
You can talk all day about your y'all.

951
00:24:32,501 --> 00:24:33,710
I have psoriasis on my elbow.

952
00:24:33,711 --> 00:24:34,670
It's really annoying.

953
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,050
It's itchy and scratchy.

954
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,460
Look at my Eczema.

955
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,350
But you started talking about,

956
00:24:39,351 --> 00:24:39,651
man,

957
00:24:39,651 --> 00:24:40,484
I just,

958
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,930
you guys ever like just
massaging your asshole.

959
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,860
Do you massage your ass off?

960
00:24:43,861 --> 00:24:44,271
Then people are like,

961
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:45,590
what the fuck are you talking about?

962
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:46,221
You know,

963
00:24:46,221 --> 00:24:46,641
you could say,

964
00:24:46,641 --> 00:24:46,881
dude,

965
00:24:46,881 --> 00:24:49,130
when I get home I'd massage
my neck on the way home.

966
00:24:49,131 --> 00:24:49,341
You know,

967
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:50,420
sometimes it gets so stiff.

968
00:24:50,421 --> 00:24:52,190
I just give it a solid massage on my own.

969
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:53,030
I feel so much better.

970
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:53,571
Yeah.

971
00:24:53,571 --> 00:24:53,811
Yeah,

972
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:54,201
me too.

973
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:54,920
I know what you mean.

974
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,240
I like to massage my asshole.

975
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,133
It feels really good.

976
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:57,680
It feels,

977
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,070
no,

978
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,903
I don't,

979
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:59,520
but,

980
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,800
but if someone said that,

981
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,780
you know,

982
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,930
but do you know?

983
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:03,530
No,

984
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,220
that'd be awesome.

985
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,550
But it's something about you talking
about your asshole and pleasure that makes

986
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:08,384
me terrified.

987
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,303
Does it really?

988
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,190
Okay.

989
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:14,000
I'll tell you a pain story about salaries
because it's sitting on the toilet,

990
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,780
as you said,

991
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,770
for all that time.

992
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,020
I got an anal fissure.

993
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,470
Oh,

994
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:18,950
Jesus.

995
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,820
You ever had one of those?

996
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:20,240
No.

997
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,440
You never want one of these.

998
00:25:21,441 --> 00:25:22,010
This,

999
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:22,843
I've never,

1000
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:25,760
I've never been punched in the
face or choked out or anything.

1001
00:25:25,761 --> 00:25:26,391
Fucking cool,

1002
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:30,140
but this was the most pain I think
I've ever felt in my entire life.

1003
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:30,830
Really.

1004
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,160
It's that ring it,

1005
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,010
that sphincter is the fulcrum.

1006
00:25:34,011 --> 00:25:34,910
Your entire body.

1007
00:25:34,911 --> 00:25:39,830
You start to discover anything you
do reverberates in your asshole.

1008
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,180
I know it sounds deep.

1009
00:25:41,181 --> 00:25:42,860
It's not move your finger.

1010
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,810
You can feel it when arm.

1011
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,860
You can feel it and you
only really realize it when
there's something wrong down

1012
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:49,101
there.

1013
00:25:49,101 --> 00:25:53,860
And an anal fissure is when there's
a tear right on the fucking lip.

1014
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,490
Uracil somewhere on the ring or this
one extended it a little deeper and I,

1015
00:25:58,491 --> 00:25:59,360
I didn't know what it was.

1016
00:25:59,361 --> 00:26:00,021
It's painful,

1017
00:26:00,021 --> 00:26:00,261
man.

1018
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:05,261
Like so painful that like I asked my
wife and my wife's never fucking see me

1019
00:26:05,301 --> 00:26:06,290
completely naked,

1020
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:07,400
let alone my asshole.

1021
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:08,480
I literally was like,

1022
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,670
I'm going to ask you to
do that fucking thing.

1023
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:13,010
I never imagined I'd ask
another human being to do.

1024
00:26:13,011 --> 00:26:13,461
And she's like,

1025
00:26:13,461 --> 00:26:14,294
what?

1026
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:14,721
And I was like,

1027
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:16,160
I'm going to lay on the bed.

1028
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,780
I'm a fucking crane.

1029
00:26:17,781 --> 00:26:19,580
Open my two fucking cheeks.

1030
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:23,390
I'm gonna need you to look in there
and tell me if something looks funky.

1031
00:26:23,391 --> 00:26:24,224
Now

1032
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,910
I've never even seen my own asshole,

1033
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,190
but I know for a fact,

1034
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,060
dude,

1035
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,740
I've got hair down there too,

1036
00:26:30,741 --> 00:26:31,121
so I'm,

1037
00:26:31,121 --> 00:26:31,490
I'm,

1038
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,211
I'm telling her,

1039
00:26:32,211 --> 00:26:32,541
I'm like,

1040
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:36,110
now you might have to deal with
a little shrubbery down there.

1041
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,550
There's no manscaping.

1042
00:26:37,551 --> 00:26:39,080
So if that's the case,

1043
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:40,070
you might have to move hair.

1044
00:26:40,071 --> 00:26:40,640
And she's like,

1045
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,331
oh my God,

1046
00:26:41,331 --> 00:26:42,440
please don't make me do this.

1047
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,070
Like there's

1048
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,120
no one but you.

1049
00:26:45,121 --> 00:26:45,541
I was like,

1050
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:46,141
I'm sorry.

1051
00:26:46,141 --> 00:26:46,800
I wouldn't have,

1052
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,581
I was in pain,

1053
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:47,731
dude.

1054
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:47,911
It was,

1055
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:48,990
and I was crying.

1056
00:26:48,991 --> 00:26:49,824
It's hurts so much.

1057
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,860
So I lay down,

1058
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,940
she's looking at it and she was like,

1059
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,510
I don't know.

1060
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,880
There's just so many roles,

1061
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:56,820
you know,

1062
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,720
she couldn't get to it.

1063
00:26:57,721 --> 00:26:57,991
I was like,

1064
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:58,650
come on,

1065
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,550
do you see any blood?

1066
00:26:59,551 --> 00:26:59,881
She's like,

1067
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:01,380
I think I see some blood.

1068
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:03,210
I think I see like an inflamed area.

1069
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,160
And I went to a doctor and the doctor,

1070
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:05,761
it's like,

1071
00:27:05,761 --> 00:27:07,080
get up on the table and whatnot,

1072
00:27:07,081 --> 00:27:10,950
and I'd never want to Approch tologist
and I'm laying on the table and he opens

1073
00:27:10,951 --> 00:27:12,820
my cheek and he doesn't even,

1074
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,050
he puts a flashlight on the
outside of my fucking ring piece.

1075
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:16,680
He done,

1076
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,690
I'm waiting for her to
like the fletch move.

1077
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:19,740
We're moving along river.

1078
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,170
He takes a look with just the flashlight.

1079
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:22,590
He goes,

1080
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:22,951
oh,

1081
00:27:22,951 --> 00:27:23,784
anal fissure.

1082
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,690
I go,

1083
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:25,200
really?

1084
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,861
Is that what it is?

1085
00:27:25,861 --> 00:27:26,161
He goes,

1086
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:26,460
yeah.

1087
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:26,761
I was like,

1088
00:27:26,761 --> 00:27:27,240
you're going to,

1089
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,051
you don't want to go deeper.

1090
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:28,381
He's going,

1091
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:28,980
I don't need to.

1092
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,401
And he's going,

1093
00:27:29,401 --> 00:27:30,570
you don't want me to either.

1094
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:31,351
And I said,

1095
00:27:31,351 --> 00:27:32,250
what do you do about them?

1096
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,840
It's going to give you two,

1097
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,320
uh,

1098
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:34,770
creams.

1099
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:35,580
One's topical,

1100
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,870
one a little more insertion.

1101
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:37,960
He's going,

1102
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,490
uh,

1103
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,260
basically,

1104
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,021
what was the figure?

1105
00:27:40,021 --> 00:27:40,321
He said,

1106
00:27:40,321 --> 00:27:40,531
God,

1107
00:27:40,531 --> 00:27:40,981
I can't remember.

1108
00:27:40,981 --> 00:27:41,814
He said,

1109
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,260
in eight to 10 weeks,

1110
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,240
you'll start feeling 50% better.

1111
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,160
And I looked at him like,

1112
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:47,520
dude,

1113
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,080
what are you kidding me?

1114
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:53,340
And it may not have been eight 10 may
have been four or five but it was a long

1115
00:27:53,341 --> 00:27:54,300
period of time,

1116
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,220
only 50% better.

1117
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,590
And I was like two that
I don't like these odds.

1118
00:27:58,591 --> 00:27:58,921
He's like,

1119
00:27:58,921 --> 00:28:00,150
that's as best I could do.

1120
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,571
He's like,

1121
00:28:00,571 --> 00:28:02,370
that's either that he can go for surgery,

1122
00:28:02,371 --> 00:28:02,971
but trust me,

1123
00:28:02,971 --> 00:28:03,960
you don't want that.

1124
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,680
He's like,

1125
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,101
I said,

1126
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:05,790
what surgeries?

1127
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:05,970
Like,

1128
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,400
well basically we get in there
and the needle and sew you up.

1129
00:28:08,401 --> 00:28:08,701
I'm like,

1130
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:09,270
forget it.

1131
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,103
I'll wait for it to heal.

1132
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:13,530
And it was fucking misery getting
in with a needle and sew you up.

1133
00:28:13,531 --> 00:28:15,180
And then how long does
it take for that thing?

1134
00:28:15,181 --> 00:28:16,890
And then it takes her a
while to fucking heels.

1135
00:28:16,891 --> 00:28:18,120
So their whole thing is like,

1136
00:28:18,121 --> 00:28:20,360
just keep prompting this
topical on it and natural.

1137
00:28:20,361 --> 00:28:21,240
It'll heal itself.

1138
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,720
Try not to fucking rough around with them.

1139
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,870
Like I don't want to even go near it.

1140
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,440
Going around with your bundle.

1141
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:26,760
Yeah,

1142
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,350
I'm like to use those terms,

1143
00:28:28,351 --> 00:28:28,681
I said,

1144
00:28:28,681 --> 00:28:28,970
doc,

1145
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,910
I went around with it son.

1146
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,610
I said like Joe Rogan,

1147
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:33,960
I like to massage my asshole.

1148
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,460
What will this mean for that?

1149
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,421
But he said,

1150
00:28:36,421 --> 00:28:36,660
uh,

1151
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,141
he was like,

1152
00:28:37,141 --> 00:28:37,950
it's very common.

1153
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,783
He goes,

1154
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,020
if you're in a room,

1155
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:44,040
45% of the people in the room are
dealing with anal fissure and he's gone.

1156
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,480
Nobody talks about it.

1157
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:45,781
I said,

1158
00:28:45,781 --> 00:28:46,021
why?

1159
00:28:46,021 --> 00:28:48,650
He's gone because it has everything
to do with your ass hole.

1160
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,561
He's calling people.

1161
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,640
He was saying the exact same thing.

1162
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:50,881
He's like,

1163
00:28:50,881 --> 00:28:52,080
people don't talk about
this kind of thing.

1164
00:28:52,081 --> 00:28:52,390
Public,

1165
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:56,460
it'd be much easier because you wouldn't
have people waiting as long as they do

1166
00:28:56,461 --> 00:28:57,294
to come in.

1167
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:57,601
It's going,

1168
00:28:57,601 --> 00:28:58,411
it's common practice.

1169
00:28:58,411 --> 00:28:58,711
He says,

1170
00:28:58,711 --> 00:28:59,790
you know how yours happened?

1171
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:00,601
And I was like,

1172
00:29:00,601 --> 00:29:01,081
I don't know.

1173
00:29:01,081 --> 00:29:03,720
I thought he was going to be like
a lot of fucking bathroom activity,

1174
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:04,051
man.

1175
00:29:04,051 --> 00:29:05,940
A lot of fucking blow
glory holes and Shit.

1176
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:06,511
I said,

1177
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:06,751
no,

1178
00:29:06,751 --> 00:29:06,931
no,

1179
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:08,160
I don't know how it happened.

1180
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,211
And he said,

1181
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:10,440
you sit on the toilet a lot.

1182
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:10,860
I bet.

1183
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,190
I said,

1184
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:11,581
I do.

1185
00:29:11,581 --> 00:29:12,420
As a matter of fact,

1186
00:29:12,421 --> 00:29:12,811
he's going,

1187
00:29:12,811 --> 00:29:13,020
well,

1188
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,480
your weight sitting on
that toilet and he's going,

1189
00:29:15,481 --> 00:29:17,040
I bet you don't just go and leave.

1190
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:17,874
You sit there for awhile.

1191
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,301
I said,

1192
00:29:18,301 --> 00:29:18,960
yeah,

1193
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,380
he's gone.

1194
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,820
It's just think about it.

1195
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,400
Gravity's just pulling it that you know,

1196
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:24,121
as you sit there,

1197
00:29:24,121 --> 00:29:27,480
it's not like you're sitting on the toilet
and your butt cheeks are clenched in

1198
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:28,850
your asshole is fucking tight.

1199
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:30,951
Is that how you do?

1200
00:29:30,951 --> 00:29:33,030
I'll tell him nothing's getting in here.

1201
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,110
Excellent posture.

1202
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,540
Your shit comes out through your balls.

1203
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,550
My Shit comes out when I tell it to

1204
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,153
all look out.

1205
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,040
Do you never want

1206
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,550
that?

1207
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,181
Oh my God,

1208
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,380
that sounds horrible.

1209
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:45,300
So I remember,

1210
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,950
so only 50% fist six weeks,

1211
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:49,480
50% when we're done.

1212
00:29:49,481 --> 00:29:51,450
Did it take until it was 100% oh,

1213
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,200
honestly it felt like months.

1214
00:29:53,201 --> 00:29:55,120
I think it was months for months.

1215
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,180
All I could do literally
was like lay on the bed,

1216
00:29:58,181 --> 00:29:59,050
belly down.

1217
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,170
And if I took it on,

1218
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:01,991
oddly enough,

1219
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:03,130
when I took a shit,

1220
00:30:03,131 --> 00:30:04,150
it felt better,

1221
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:07,750
but it only felt better for the moment
on I was taking the shit because then I

1222
00:30:07,751 --> 00:30:08,430
guess what?

1223
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,550
I don't know what I don't know.

1224
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,200
I can't even tell you the science of it,

1225
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,401
but when I took a shit,

1226
00:30:12,401 --> 00:30:13,001
I felt better.

1227
00:30:13,001 --> 00:30:14,470
As soon as I was done taking a shit.

1228
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:19,180
That's when the agony kicked in of like
reminding you it was there and you would

1229
00:30:19,181 --> 00:30:21,670
literally just flinch
and squirm on the bed,

1230
00:30:21,671 --> 00:30:23,860
like fucking withdrawn
or something like that.

1231
00:30:23,861 --> 00:30:25,160
It was men nasty.

1232
00:30:25,161 --> 00:30:25,321
Yeah.

1233
00:30:25,321 --> 00:30:27,470
The last thing you want
to get household problem.

1234
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,110
Yeah.

1235
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,460
It's the fulcrum of your body.

1236
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,150
I had to internal hemorrhoid for that
reason and they had to do the rubber band

1237
00:30:33,151 --> 00:30:37,710
technique where they Tyrol band around
inside your asshole and he tight super

1238
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:40,410
tight so it gets no blood
supply and it falls off.

1239
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,070
Well,

1240
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,040
I'm like this is this going to hurt?

1241
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:42,301
And he goes,

1242
00:30:42,301 --> 00:30:42,481
no,

1243
00:30:42,481 --> 00:30:43,890
it's more of an annoying pain.

1244
00:30:43,891 --> 00:30:44,161
And I'm like,

1245
00:30:44,161 --> 00:30:44,700
all right.

1246
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:49,700
I go home and it was like somebody shoving
their like fingernail into your ass

1247
00:30:50,231 --> 00:30:53,970
hole from the inside and just sing there
and twisting it and turning it like a

1248
00:30:53,971 --> 00:30:55,840
fucking shit passage.

1249
00:30:55,841 --> 00:30:56,311
It's shit.

1250
00:30:56,311 --> 00:30:57,510
Get caught up on the banner.

1251
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,380
No,

1252
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,130
I don't know.

1253
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:02,280
How big is this thing that you can
wrap a rubber band around it and it was

1254
00:31:02,281 --> 00:31:02,731
pretty big.

1255
00:31:02,731 --> 00:31:05,550
And then her having get rid of the
hemorrhoid or grape or whatever.

1256
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:09,090
I've had a hemorrhoid before they said
that I was supposed to go back maybe two

1257
00:31:09,091 --> 00:31:09,870
or three times.

1258
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:10,860
This is a whole process.

1259
00:31:10,861 --> 00:31:12,780
The first time it's
probably not going to do it.

1260
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,700
I wouldn't go back to the second one.

1261
00:31:14,701 --> 00:31:17,610
So now I live with the little guy and
he's just this little teeny guy now.

1262
00:31:17,611 --> 00:31:20,790
But once in a while if he eats like if
I eat the wrong thing it blows up and is

1263
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:21,510
like Yo bitch,

1264
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,490
not Jews claim to clamp style.

1265
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,170
You still have it in there tied up?

1266
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:25,611
No,

1267
00:31:25,611 --> 00:31:25,810
no,

1268
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:25,970
no,

1269
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:26,161
no,

1270
00:31:26,161 --> 00:31:26,341
no.

1271
00:31:26,341 --> 00:31:29,780
The rubber band dissolved but it's
the internal hemorrhoids still exists.

1272
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,160
Yeah,

1273
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,090
he's got a clip so I just
returns whenever it wants to.

1274
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,230
It went whenever I like get crazy,

1275
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,040
eat a bunch of hot peppers or for eating.

1276
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,910
It's hot peppers.

1277
00:31:38,911 --> 00:31:40,860
It's a lot of fucking like caffeine.

1278
00:31:40,861 --> 00:31:41,960
It's a lot of like really?

1279
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:44,620
I had heard that it's from
greasy forcing your shit out.

1280
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:49,770
Monitors from pushing like I've got a
resident just like yours is mostly quiet.

1281
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:50,050
Nice.

1282
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,810
Lodger but periodically,

1283
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:52,641
hey,

1284
00:31:52,641 --> 00:31:54,520
if I'm down here and it's always fun,

1285
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:57,630
I'm fucking up like on the
toilet and I'm fucking pushing.

1286
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,840
Maybe I'm not ready to go,

1287
00:31:58,841 --> 00:31:59,321
but I'm like,

1288
00:31:59,321 --> 00:32:00,011
if I don't go now,

1289
00:32:00,011 --> 00:32:01,540
I'm not going to be able to
go for a couple of hours.

1290
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,970
Once in awhile he shoots somebody
and there's blood everywhere.

1291
00:32:03,971 --> 00:32:05,010
You know it's like a code.

1292
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:05,740
Yes.

1293
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,510
Oh yes.

1294
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:08,403
My buddy.

1295
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,010
Yeah.

1296
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:10,661
Bloody nose.

1297
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:11,351
No big deal.

1298
00:32:11,351 --> 00:32:12,280
Bloody asshole.

1299
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,020
Oh,

1300
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,700
for reals.

1301
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,230
Want to go to the fights,

1302
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:17,501
dude.

1303
00:32:17,501 --> 00:32:18,940
Some of them were last time around.

1304
00:32:18,941 --> 00:32:19,540
I'm going to fight.

1305
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,210
We got to do it.

1306
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,310
Roll a camera on me though.

1307
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:21,701
Okay.

1308
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:23,980
So are you could watch me for sure.

1309
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,251
Well,

1310
00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:24,551
there's,

1311
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:24,821
um,

1312
00:32:24,821 --> 00:32:27,430
there's going to be a big card
on Fox coming up real soon.

1313
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,220
Um,

1314
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:28,660
uh,

1315
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,800
I think it's November.

1316
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:30,640
That I don't want to say,

1317
00:32:30,641 --> 00:32:31,660
I think it's the 14th.

1318
00:32:31,661 --> 00:32:32,650
I have to look at his schedule,

1319
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,431
but it's,

1320
00:32:33,431 --> 00:32:33,790
uh,

1321
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:38,790
it's going to be on Fox and I think
they're announcing tomorrow who the,

1322
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:39,171
uh,

1323
00:32:39,171 --> 00:32:39,921
the fighters are,

1324
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:40,070
but

1325
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,210
that'll be an Anaheim.

1326
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,560
So that's fucking clothes.

1327
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,880
And you do all of them.

1328
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,110
Are you always the guy?

1329
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:45,371
Yeah.

1330
00:32:45,371 --> 00:32:45,611
Yeah,

1331
00:32:45,611 --> 00:32:46,110
yeah.

1332
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,520
All right.

1333
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,460
I didn't do this.

1334
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,930
I don't have to buy tickets for this shit.

1335
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:50,090
Yeah,

1336
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:50,631
we'll hook you up,

1337
00:32:50,631 --> 00:32:51,230
man.

1338
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,000
Come on Dawg.

1339
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,140
Like you spend your money fucking Smith.

1340
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,123
Kevin Smith

1341
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:59,240
punched in that ring.

1342
00:32:59,241 --> 00:33:00,380
I want to make sure to get paid.

1343
00:33:00,381 --> 00:33:00,880
I'm happy.

1344
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,140
Oh they get paid a motherfucker now.

1345
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,730
They must be paid a
little bit of our gate.

1346
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:04,971
Right.

1347
00:33:04,971 --> 00:33:05,804
That's how

1348
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:07,971
it's different.

1349
00:33:07,971 --> 00:33:10,340
I mean they get different
deals but you know the gates,

1350
00:33:10,341 --> 00:33:11,510
it's almost always sold out.

1351
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,680
Almost all the,

1352
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,170
almost all of the domestic UFC sellout.

1353
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:20,870
We've had a few problems
and other countries where
they really weren't like hip

1354
00:33:20,871 --> 00:33:21,920
on the UFC.

1355
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,280
You know,

1356
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,650
Germany wasn't like the biggest
success when we were over there.

1357
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,830
We don't like this stop
hitting each other.

1358
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,280
Didn't,

1359
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:28,851
it wasn't like,

1360
00:33:28,851 --> 00:33:29,810
it's not like Australia.

1361
00:33:29,811 --> 00:33:31,370
Australia sells out in like an hour.

1362
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,840
Whenever we put on a show in Australia,

1363
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,160
people go fucking nuts,

1364
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,890
but it was a little more difficult.

1365
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:37,930
What about cooking it on its,

1366
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:40,430
they blocked us from television
or something in Germany too.

1367
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:43,250
There was something crazy or you
can only get it on paper view.

1368
00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:44,760
They couldn't have it on live television.

1369
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,613
Germany,

1370
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,391
Canada,

1371
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:46,890
Canada,

1372
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:50,420
Canada is great because I always find
it's very similar to Australia or vice

1373
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:51,254
versa.

1374
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,130
Canada's awesome.

1375
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,210
I fucking love Canada.

1376
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,090
I would live there if
it wasn't so confusing,

1377
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:56,631
you know,

1378
00:33:56,631 --> 00:33:58,760
if I didn't have to pay taxes
to two different countries,

1379
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,990
GST and pst.

1380
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,500
I think Vancouver's city's
government and the province,

1381
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:04,730
you know you're paying,

1382
00:34:04,731 --> 00:34:06,850
it's the saint and essentially
federal and state taxes.

1383
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:07,100
Yeah,

1384
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,900
but then you also have
to pay for American too.

1385
00:34:08,901 --> 00:34:10,420
Unless you want to wait a minute.

1386
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,391
If you want to live,

1387
00:34:11,391 --> 00:34:12,890
if you want to live in another country,

1388
00:34:12,891 --> 00:34:14,320
unless you want to give
up your citizen's suit,

1389
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,840
you have to pay American taxes.

1390
00:34:15,841 --> 00:34:16,030
Yeah,

1391
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:16,790
you would have to owe.

1392
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,590
If you're talking about
doing dual citizen,

1393
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,730
I'm not saying I hate America,

1394
00:34:20,731 --> 00:34:21,201
I just like,

1395
00:34:21,201 --> 00:34:21,620
I would,

1396
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:24,320
I would live in Vancouver
and Vancouver is that shit.

1397
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,000
[inaudible] fucking cities ever.

1398
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:27,740
I'd go for Toronto Hockey Hall of fame.

1399
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:28,581
I love Toronto,

1400
00:34:28,581 --> 00:34:31,050
but it gets cold as a motherfucker.

1401
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,510
Don't whether I grew up in east coast,

1402
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,210
I grew up in Boston and I'm scared.

1403
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:34,570
You know,

1404
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:35,403
it was,

1405
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,940
you don't want to go back to Edmonton.

1406
00:34:37,941 --> 00:34:39,440
I would lack eyes too,

1407
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,660
but my lady would never
let me live in Canada.

1408
00:34:41,661 --> 00:34:41,960
Man.

1409
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,980
You guys don't like Vancouver.

1410
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:43,131
Well,

1411
00:34:43,131 --> 00:34:43,581
my life,

1412
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,081
Vancouver,

1413
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:44,320
I,

1414
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,410
she was at school there.

1415
00:34:45,411 --> 00:34:47,390
I shot a TV show there and movie.

1416
00:34:47,391 --> 00:34:47,830
They're like,

1417
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:48,411
I do,

1418
00:34:48,411 --> 00:34:49,310
but it's not,

1419
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,900
I'm not into whale art.

1420
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:51,953
All right.

1421
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,630
A lot of that up there,

1422
00:34:53,631 --> 00:34:53,901
man.

1423
00:34:53,901 --> 00:34:54,830
That and trees.

1424
00:34:54,831 --> 00:34:55,490
Fuck tree.

1425
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:56,390
As a comic,

1426
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:56,800
you know,

1427
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,160
I,

1428
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,220
I traveled too much,

1429
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:58,520
man.

1430
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,630
I would stand up and with the UFC I
traveled too much to risk being snowed in.

1431
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,970
So if I live somewhere like Toronto,

1432
00:35:04,971 --> 00:35:06,590
I would always risk being stuck,

1433
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:07,420
you know,

1434
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,630
and you risk being stuck.

1435
00:35:08,631 --> 00:35:09,110
It's not,

1436
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:12,500
it's not a sensible place to
live if you're a traveler,

1437
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,001
unless of course,

1438
00:35:14,001 --> 00:35:14,834
you know,

1439
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:15,670
you can,

1440
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,220
you know,

1441
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,810
figure out how to get out of town before
the snow hits and you work your other

1442
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,820
and it shows up in the snowcat
snow cat up that mountain.

1443
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:23,271
Totally,

1444
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:23,451
man.

1445
00:35:23,451 --> 00:35:26,000
Just look out for the dude
behind the fucking ah,

1446
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:26,750
with the ax.

1447
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,370
I do think that I liked that one.

1448
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,480
Did you didn't see that,

1449
00:35:29,481 --> 00:35:31,600
that Jack Nicholson motherfucker shining.

1450
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,080
He couldn't shine that at all.

1451
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,280
That was a great God damn movie.

1452
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:34,500
Oh,

1453
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,061
it's brilliant.

1454
00:35:35,061 --> 00:35:36,290
And Stephen King doesn't like it.

1455
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:37,124
You know that.

1456
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:37,740
Yeah.

1457
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:37,900
No.

1458
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,100
So

1459
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,990
much so that he made sure
they made another one.

1460
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,180
Assess makeup.

1461
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,300
Make a worst one.

1462
00:35:42,301 --> 00:35:43,290
Make a terrible one.

1463
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,730
This other one was too good.

1464
00:35:44,731 --> 00:35:45,600
Make a bad one.

1465
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:45,901
Yeah,

1466
00:35:45,901 --> 00:35:46,161
that,

1467
00:35:46,161 --> 00:35:46,591
that other,

1468
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:48,000
the TV movie one is tough.

1469
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,120
I never saw the TV movie or remember it.

1470
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,600
Even Weber from wings replaces Jack
Nicholson right then and there.

1471
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,500
I mean my stealing
Steven Weber because he,

1472
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,390
that's balls of steel dude.

1473
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:01,230
You know what I'm saying?

1474
00:36:01,231 --> 00:36:02,064
To be like,

1475
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,030
all right,

1476
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,930
I'll give it a shot.

1477
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,011
The dude or,

1478
00:36:05,011 --> 00:36:08,010
but to be fair is what heath
ledger did years later.

1479
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:12,360
He stepped into a role at bat at that
Jack Nicholson made iconic and stuff.

1480
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,560
That all being said,

1481
00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:15,820
hats off to Steven Weber
and movies a Tufts.

1482
00:36:15,821 --> 00:36:16,200
It,

1483
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:16,710
yeah.

1484
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,220
It ain't the shining by parents.

1485
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,600
It was on so many pills.

1486
00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:21,160
He didn't even know what fucking,

1487
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,220
you know what position he was
taken when Heath Ledger died,

1488
00:36:24,221 --> 00:36:25,630
he was on so many different pills.

1489
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,510
Is that what they said?

1490
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:26,840
Yeah.

1491
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,401
Who knows?

1492
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:27,660
Yeah,

1493
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,990
he's his state of mind.

1494
00:36:28,991 --> 00:36:29,171
I mean,

1495
00:36:29,171 --> 00:36:29,831
when you hear it,

1496
00:36:29,831 --> 00:36:31,660
all the different shit that
he was on when he died,

1497
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,040
that guy,

1498
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,551
I mean there's,

1499
00:36:33,551 --> 00:36:34,211
there's a lot of those.

1500
00:36:34,211 --> 00:36:37,960
Don't give a fuck guys that can put in
like spectacular performances like that.

1501
00:36:37,961 --> 00:36:42,961
Like that heath ledger joker was a fucking
pretty spectacular performance when a

1502
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,370
dude has something like
that and sign of him,

1503
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:45,851
you know,

1504
00:36:45,851 --> 00:36:46,150
you don't,

1505
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:46,460
that's a,

1506
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:50,110
that's an a amazing abundance of energy
and you're not exactly sure how he's

1507
00:36:50,111 --> 00:36:50,980
controlling that.

1508
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,520
Not everybody can have that kind of
a burst of energy inside of them and,

1509
00:36:54,521 --> 00:36:54,681
and,

1510
00:36:54,681 --> 00:36:55,900
and put it under control.

1511
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:59,620
Some people like literally aren't
capable of that kind of a performance.

1512
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,580
You think he was,

1513
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,300
you think,

1514
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,820
I think he's probably had a
little bit of crazy in a man.

1515
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,560
No little bit of crazy.

1516
00:37:05,561 --> 00:37:06,670
And then he gets on pills.

1517
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,650
Some cats just make pretend real well.

1518
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,310
Yeah,

1519
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,143
for sure.

1520
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,020
No doubt about it.

1521
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:16,140
But with all the pill thing and that I
don't want to place in his fucking like I

1522
00:37:16,661 --> 00:37:17,251
was high.

1523
00:37:17,251 --> 00:37:19,080
It's got into the headspace of the joker.

1524
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,320
I don't even think that.

1525
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:20,680
I don't know.

1526
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,513
I don't know.

1527
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:22,280
Not,

1528
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,470
I just think he's just good,

1529
00:37:23,471 --> 00:37:28,471
but I'm just thinking that being really
brilliant at something like acting and

1530
00:37:28,661 --> 00:37:31,720
being completely fucking insane
or like next door neighbors,

1531
00:37:31,721 --> 00:37:31,871
man.

1532
00:37:31,871 --> 00:37:32,500
Yeah,

1533
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,221
it's a thin line.

1534
00:37:33,221 --> 00:37:34,060
I agree with that total.

1535
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:38,530
The ability to lock onto a character
so completely and captivating

1536
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,440
and create it real.

1537
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,990
Make it so real that
you're sitting there like,

1538
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:43,381
look,

1539
00:37:43,381 --> 00:37:44,730
I love that joker performance.

1540
00:37:44,731 --> 00:37:49,320
It's spellbinding but I sit dial like
one movie back and look at them and the

1541
00:37:49,321 --> 00:37:53,190
gay cowboy picture that the
performance he gives him that movie,

1542
00:37:53,191 --> 00:37:54,900
that dude exists.

1543
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:59,730
Like the joker performance is big
and it needs to be big and like pray.

1544
00:37:59,731 --> 00:38:01,800
You never meet someone
like that in your life,

1545
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,690
but you would meet the carer.

1546
00:38:03,691 --> 00:38:06,930
I think it was ena Serenas he played
the character he played in Brokeback

1547
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:07,231
mountain.

1548
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:10,260
That performance is so
fucking frighteningly real.

1549
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:13,110
That was the first time I was like
this mother fucker's or an actor.

1550
00:38:13,111 --> 00:38:15,510
I thought he was that dude from
10 things I hate about you.

1551
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:20,580
But he had shops cause he made only
one other actor will to others parks.

1552
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:23,580
Michael Parks did that for
me and from dusk till dawn,

1553
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,540
like that's why I've read state exists.

1554
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:28,320
Cause I watched the opening 10
minutes of from dusk till dawn back in

1555
00:38:28,321 --> 00:38:29,280
[inaudible] 95 I was like,

1556
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,470
this mother fucker's Yoda.

1557
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:35,620
Like how do I want to spend a month
on set with a dude who can drop site

1558
00:38:35,621 --> 00:38:36,220
performance

1559
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:36,641
science,

1560
00:38:36,641 --> 00:38:37,750
this fucking brilliant,

1561
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:38,501
this laser sharp,

1562
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:39,610
this other worldly.

1563
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:40,870
Um,

1564
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:41,800
but then the other one,

1565
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:42,461
God who was,

1566
00:38:42,461 --> 00:38:43,420
I just had it in my head.

1567
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:43,931
What was the other one?

1568
00:38:43,931 --> 00:38:44,764
I said parks.

1569
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:45,670
Oh,

1570
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,950
Billy Bob Thornton in a simple plan.

1571
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:49,120
Do you ever see a simple plan?

1572
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,560
That fucking movie is a,

1573
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,331
wasn't named guy.

1574
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:56,110
Did Spiderman movie was us
as a movie with Bill Paxton.

1575
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,513
Uh,

1576
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,570
a simple plan.

1577
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,530
Bill Paxton,

1578
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,070
uh,

1579
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:00,910
Bill Bill.

1580
00:39:00,911 --> 00:39:01,211
What's the,

1581
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:02,230
what did I say his name was?

1582
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,041
You know,

1583
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:03,461
Billy,

1584
00:39:03,461 --> 00:39:04,294
what's his face?

1585
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,620
I was going to that new guy,

1586
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,100
guys fucked Angelina Jolie,

1587
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:10,723
Billy Joe,

1588
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:13,460
Billy,

1589
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,470
Bob Thornton,

1590
00:39:14,471 --> 00:39:15,330
Jesus crap,

1591
00:39:15,331 --> 00:39:17,470
Billy Bob Thornton and uh,

1592
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,160
and who else?

1593
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:18,341
Oh,

1594
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:19,540
Bridget Fonda's in it.

1595
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,940
This fucking movie is so good.

1596
00:39:21,941 --> 00:39:22,541
So well done.

1597
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:24,940
It's about dudes who
find money in the woods,

1598
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,953
drug money,

1599
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,250
and then they're trying to like,

1600
00:39:27,251 --> 00:39:28,061
it's a simple plan.

1601
00:39:28,061 --> 00:39:30,640
We're going to hold it
and whack it up together.

1602
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,200
We're going to wait some time and then
it just gets more and more complicated

1603
00:39:34,201 --> 00:39:36,220
and fucking horrible things
start happening and shit.

1604
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,180
Excellent movie.

1605
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:38,050
Well done.

1606
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:42,790
But Billy Bob Thornton gives a performance
in this movie where he ceases to be

1607
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:44,470
Billy Bob Thornton and you're just like,

1608
00:39:44,471 --> 00:39:45,610
that character exists.

1609
00:39:45,611 --> 00:39:47,240
The man who is in this movie,

1610
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,540
there's no connection
to Billy Bob Thornton.

1611
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,260
Like it's literally a dude being possessed
of someone else or something like

1612
00:39:53,261 --> 00:39:53,351
that.

1613
00:39:53,351 --> 00:39:54,280
He changes his look.

1614
00:39:54,281 --> 00:39:56,830
Changes is deliver is
every perfect example,

1615
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,431
I think to,

1616
00:39:57,431 --> 00:39:59,340
to be that good you do.

1617
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:01,810
There has to be a part of you
that's a little bit fucking crazy.

1618
00:40:01,811 --> 00:40:04,570
And we know Billy Bob Thornton
is a little bit fucking crazy,

1619
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,370
no doubt about Meryl Streep.

1620
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:06,710
She,

1621
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,600
you think she's a little bit of,

1622
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,590
she just keeps it together.

1623
00:40:08,591 --> 00:40:12,730
By then she keeps her composure and
then she just got better composure,

1624
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,780
more self aware,

1625
00:40:13,781 --> 00:40:17,770
but that the demon inside her beats
just as freely as it does in Billy Bob.

1626
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:19,900
She just knows how to control
it and our social life,

1627
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:23,020
but she can blast it out when she's
pretended to be some other person.

1628
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,450
She can just let that fucking demon free.

1629
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,060
You know?

1630
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:27,160
Uh,

1631
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,690
Billy Bob Thornton is crazy as fuck.

1632
00:40:28,691 --> 00:40:29,230
Yes.

1633
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,430
I think to a certain extent,

1634
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,300
yes and no.

1635
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,580
I think it's completely containable.

1636
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,100
Yeah.

1637
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:34,550
I,

1638
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:37,300
I've seen Daniel Day Lewis get
interviewed and I think he's,

1639
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:37,991
you know,

1640
00:40:37,991 --> 00:40:41,620
he's a brilliant guy who's clearly
like doing it as an artist.

1641
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:41,801
You know,

1642
00:40:41,801 --> 00:40:46,060
he's clearly got a good handle on the
whole celebrity thing when the guy like,

1643
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:50,920
he quit movies to be a fucking shoe
cobbler and he said his crazy deep,

1644
00:40:50,921 --> 00:40:51,820
interesting Weirdo.

1645
00:40:51,821 --> 00:40:55,600
That is one of those stories that like
everybody knows that Daniel Day Lewis.

1646
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:55,920
Yeah.

1647
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,960
Abo think it captured
everybody's imagination.

1648
00:40:58,961 --> 00:41:00,820
Whether he was serious about it or not.

1649
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:05,770
It may have been his most
brilliant fucking move
because for the next 10 years,

1650
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,020
whenever somebody says Daniel Day Lewis,

1651
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,210
somewhere in the next
minute they're going to go,

1652
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:10,781
you know,

1653
00:41:10,781 --> 00:41:11,471
he was a fucking,

1654
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:12,730
he quit to be a cobbler.

1655
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,200
He studied shoe making.

1656
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:16,120
Like it captured people's imagination.

1657
00:41:16,121 --> 00:41:18,880
Like why would a guy this
good at the job go off,

1658
00:41:18,881 --> 00:41:20,140
quit and make shoes for what?

1659
00:41:20,141 --> 00:41:21,640
He came back sooner or later.

1660
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:24,350
But that shoe thing captures
people's imagination.

1661
00:41:24,351 --> 00:41:27,010
And you think he probably went
to it because it wasn't acting.

1662
00:41:27,011 --> 00:41:28,420
It was the furthest thing from acting.

1663
00:41:28,421 --> 00:41:29,254
Cause you're right,

1664
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,161
you look at dude,

1665
00:41:30,161 --> 00:41:32,110
who gets into a role like he does,

1666
00:41:32,111 --> 00:41:34,490
he probably does go to
someplace fucking dark and you,

1667
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,833
you know,

1668
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:36,561
a crew,

1669
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:37,970
a bunch of years of doing that,

1670
00:41:37,971 --> 00:41:39,080
one after another.

1671
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,240
Maybe go on a fucking make shoes in Milan.

1672
00:41:41,241 --> 00:41:41,871
Feels good.

1673
00:41:41,871 --> 00:41:42,561
Sounds good.

1674
00:41:42,561 --> 00:41:43,220
Simple.

1675
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,150
Doesn't require much.

1676
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:45,650
Use a different part of your brain.

1677
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,810
No darkness and fucking Koblin.

1678
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,610
You know,

1679
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:52,370
unless one of those fucking witches
show some of his movies where he does go

1680
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:55,910
dark are the darkest characters
in the history of cinema,

1681
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:56,870
the fucking guns,

1682
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,190
gangs and you love it.

1683
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,750
Jesus Christ build a butcher.

1684
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:00,381
That's what his name was,

1685
00:42:00,381 --> 00:42:00,690
right.

1686
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:01,560
Jesus Christ.

1687
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:04,190
Who's at a fucking scary
performance isn't any accent great.

1688
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,000
Yeah,

1689
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,110
he'd seems like he really would cut
your fucking head off with a machete.

1690
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:09,740
One of the lucky.

1691
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,190
Really.

1692
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:10,881
It's real.

1693
00:42:10,881 --> 00:42:12,500
You're feeling it all the way.

1694
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,980
The one and the only conversations I
ever had with Martin Scorsese was after a

1695
00:42:15,981 --> 00:42:16,850
screening of that movie.

1696
00:42:16,851 --> 00:42:18,980
I was coming out of the
theater and I hear somebody go,

1697
00:42:18,981 --> 00:42:19,371
Kevin,

1698
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:21,080
and it sounds like Martin
Scorsese were like,

1699
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:21,651
no way.

1700
00:42:21,651 --> 00:42:25,340
Martin Scorsese would be fucking saying
Kevin and I turned around and Martin

1701
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,300
Scorsese was sang Kevin.

1702
00:42:26,301 --> 00:42:27,290
He was talking to me and I was like,

1703
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:27,740
Whoa,

1704
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,580
holy shit man.

1705
00:42:28,581 --> 00:42:29,180
How are you?

1706
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,140
Did you ball tangle?

1707
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,460
I very much.

1708
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:32,571
You know what I'm saying?

1709
00:42:32,571 --> 00:42:33,530
Like in a way of life.

1710
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:36,530
Like the way he called
me wasn't quite peer,

1711
00:42:36,531 --> 00:42:39,740
but it was like he had no
reason to know my name exactly.

1712
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,371
And he's like,

1713
00:42:40,371 --> 00:42:40,761
what'd you think?

1714
00:42:40,761 --> 00:42:41,061
I said,

1715
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:42,530
I fucking loved it man.

1716
00:42:42,531 --> 00:42:43,910
Like an I'd stayed through autocrats,

1717
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:44,691
which I said,

1718
00:42:44,691 --> 00:42:45,231
Oh my God,

1719
00:42:45,231 --> 00:42:45,590
I love that.

1720
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:48,170
You got to tell me how did
he arrive at that accent?

1721
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:48,951
And he goes,

1722
00:42:48,951 --> 00:42:50,210
we found cylinders,

1723
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:55,130
old cylinders recorded around what is
18 whatever it turned the centered 19

1724
00:42:55,131 --> 00:42:57,140
whatever that period flick was set.

1725
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:57,711
He said,

1726
00:42:57,711 --> 00:42:58,640
we found cylinders,

1727
00:42:58,641 --> 00:43:02,360
which we just sat there and played
and Daniel took the accent from there,

1728
00:43:02,361 --> 00:43:04,160
worked on a little bit and
took the accent from there.

1729
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,001
And I was like,

1730
00:43:05,001 --> 00:43:06,020
what are the cylinder sound like?

1731
00:43:06,021 --> 00:43:06,321
He goes,

1732
00:43:06,321 --> 00:43:11,030
surprisingly crystal clear and like you
could literally hear what a person like

1733
00:43:11,031 --> 00:43:14,180
what that guy sounded like in that era.

1734
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:15,260
I see an amazing,

1735
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:19,640
I mean it was Danny Lewis is probably
our best representation of it cause I bet

1736
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:20,240
he nailed it.

1737
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,130
He must've,

1738
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,850
because we've never heard the cylinder.

1739
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,950
I've never seen him not
nail something down.

1740
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:29,180
He played a boxer and it's the best
version of an actor playing a boxer ever.

1741
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,220
He really looks like a boxer.

1742
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,510
Like as he's moving,

1743
00:43:32,511 --> 00:43:34,010
he's doing everything correctly.

1744
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:35,090
The way he's holding his hands,

1745
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,810
the Lay's responding to being hit the
ways following through with his punches,

1746
00:43:38,811 --> 00:43:39,644
with his footwork.

1747
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,950
He leaves literally looked like
he could be a professional boxer.

1748
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,850
This takes so much energy
and focus to get that good.

1749
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,400
Like he didn't just look like an actor.

1750
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:49,920
He wasn't.

1751
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,630
They taught how to box like is a perfect
example and I don't mean to diss them

1752
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,710
but Marky mark,

1753
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:55,731
Mark Walberg,

1754
00:43:55,731 --> 00:43:56,120
whatever.

1755
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,070
The fighter and the fight.

1756
00:43:57,071 --> 00:43:57,920
It was a great movie.

1757
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:01,520
I love this performance in the movie but
when you watch him boxing it looks like

1758
00:44:01,521 --> 00:44:02,630
an actor is boxing.

1759
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:03,411
Okay.

1760
00:44:03,411 --> 00:44:03,711
Really?

1761
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,710
Cause I thought he was like,

1762
00:44:04,711 --> 00:44:05,720
it looks like you can box.

1763
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:06,590
I bet he can box.

1764
00:44:06,591 --> 00:44:08,840
I bet he can box but it doesn't look like,

1765
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:12,140
like when you watch
Daniel Day Lewis do it.

1766
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:17,170
Daniel Day Lewis is moving like
a real professional boxer in.

1767
00:44:17,181 --> 00:44:17,931
When you watch him,

1768
00:44:17,931 --> 00:44:18,920
the Mark Wahlberg thing,

1769
00:44:18,921 --> 00:44:22,130
it seems like I'm watching
a movie watching a movie
where there's boxing in it

1770
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:22,860
is there's a,

1771
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,010
there's a difference in the reality.

1772
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,220
What about Stallone?

1773
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,320
Did he convinced?

1774
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:27,770
No,

1775
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:28,070
no,

1776
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:29,450
he didn't look like a box and I never,

1777
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:32,010
I mean he looks like a
guy could kick your ass.

1778
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:32,220
Oh,

1779
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,080
they'll get a wrong.

1780
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:35,400
Louis does the does the way a way,

1781
00:44:35,401 --> 00:44:38,190
a professional fighter
moves is very specific.

1782
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:39,024
You have to,

1783
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:43,020
unless you're some Roy Jones Jr freak of
nature athlete who can keep your hands

1784
00:44:43,021 --> 00:44:46,320
down and do all kinds of
crazy shit because nobody
can touch you because you're

1785
00:44:46,321 --> 00:44:47,970
so fast and your timing is so good.

1786
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:49,770
But there's only a few of those guys ever.

1787
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,690
And if you look at a classic boxer,

1788
00:44:51,691 --> 00:44:52,490
they have very,

1789
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:52,740
you know,

1790
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:53,880
very simple characteristics.

1791
00:44:53,881 --> 00:44:54,750
The hands are always up high.

1792
00:44:54,751 --> 00:44:55,584
The Chin's tucked,

1793
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:56,543
the shoulders are up.

1794
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:58,260
Nobody does that in a movie and a movie.

1795
00:44:58,290 --> 00:44:59,123
Everybody,

1796
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,080
their hands are down the throne,

1797
00:45:01,081 --> 00:45:05,040
wild punches and flexing their muscles
and it's my turn to hit you and then it's

1798
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:05,451
your turn.

1799
00:45:05,451 --> 00:45:07,170
He hit me and it looks very obvious.

1800
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:07,900
Nobody,

1801
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,210
I've never get into like
a 32nd 42nd embrace.

1802
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:14,070
None of like where they
have to get split up.

1803
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:19,140
You can't do it realistically unless
you're going to let people hit people and

1804
00:45:19,141 --> 00:45:21,780
you don't want to do that because you
only got to get one shot at it and people

1805
00:45:21,781 --> 00:45:22,531
aren't going to like it.

1806
00:45:22,531 --> 00:45:24,900
No one's going to like a
halfway fight and it's not it.

1807
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:25,440
It's like,

1808
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,690
I'm going to let you hit me and
then I'm going to hit you back.

1809
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:30,030
We're going to agree that there's a
certain amount of times we're going to hit

1810
00:45:30,031 --> 00:45:30,400
each other.

1811
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,250
We're going to hit each
other realistically hard.

1812
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,540
You can't do that.

1813
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,350
You can't do it.

1814
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:35,183
You can't fake it.

1815
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:37,463
I could do it.

1816
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:38,160
Yeah,

1817
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,150
because they can do it realistically,

1818
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,013
real easy.

1819
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:42,060
Let me ask you this.

1820
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:44,250
Other than Daniel Day Lewis,

1821
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:48,510
who has convincingly fought in a
movie that earned your respect,

1822
00:45:48,511 --> 00:45:48,901
where you're like,

1823
00:45:48,901 --> 00:45:49,291
all right,

1824
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:50,124
that looks like it.

1825
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:53,280
Other than Daniel Day Lewis
was that bars too fucking high,

1826
00:45:53,281 --> 00:45:54,030
dude.

1827
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:54,510
Yeah.

1828
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:55,100
You know what I'm saying?

1829
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:55,890
Washington.

1830
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:56,580
Denzel Washington.

1831
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,450
When he played a ruin,

1832
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:58,650
her current started fucking hot.

1833
00:45:58,651 --> 00:45:59,580
Can't you give me some of somebody?

1834
00:45:59,581 --> 00:46:00,210
It's just like,

1835
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:00,480
nope,

1836
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,410
you need a guy like that.

1837
00:46:01,411 --> 00:46:03,840
You need a bad mother fucker
who just really commit over.

1838
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:06,390
Like my friend Terry Clay Bond,

1839
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:06,630
uh,

1840
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:10,620
trained him for some of that and he would
go down to the Hollywood boxing gym.

1841
00:46:10,621 --> 00:46:12,420
It was on Labrea and uh,

1842
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:16,950
he said that guy would be out there
every fucking morning at seven o'clock.

1843
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:18,180
Blair in his music,

1844
00:46:18,181 --> 00:46:18,991
in the parking lot,

1845
00:46:18,991 --> 00:46:19,741
fired up,

1846
00:46:19,741 --> 00:46:22,530
and he said he would run up the stairs
and he would train like a professional

1847
00:46:22,531 --> 00:46:23,364
boxer.

1848
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:25,260
He said he did everything
I asked him to do,

1849
00:46:25,261 --> 00:46:27,090
did it exactly the way
I told him to do it.

1850
00:46:27,091 --> 00:46:27,990
Skipped rope,

1851
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:28,980
sit ups.

1852
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:30,420
When he's in there every day,

1853
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:34,410
he literally transformed himself
into a professional boxer.

1854
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:34,900
There's a,

1855
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,200
there's only a few guys
who can hit that level,

1856
00:46:37,201 --> 00:46:38,220
that Daniel Day Lewis,

1857
00:46:38,221 --> 00:46:40,620
that Denzel Washington
level of commitment.

1858
00:46:40,621 --> 00:46:42,150
And it was only a few
guys who can do that.

1859
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,150
So Daniel,

1860
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:46,050
so that was the only two guys that
I've ever seen that looked like real

1861
00:46:46,051 --> 00:46:46,530
fighters.

1862
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:49,440
Daniel Day Lewis and Denzel
Washington fighting each other.

1863
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,090
Who went Daniel Lewis,

1864
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,990
can the fuck add it as a crazy one?

1865
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:54,400
I had,

1866
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,150
it's gotta be done.

1867
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:56,910
So he'll get tired.

1868
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,230
He'll gas out.

1869
00:46:58,230 --> 00:46:59,190
He'll start off strong.

1870
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,650
Daniel taking punches for talking shit,

1871
00:47:01,651 --> 00:47:02,484
Bro.

1872
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,210
Talking about talking shit.

1873
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:08,160
I just have to guess if I looked at the
boxer that Daniel Day Lewis was and I

1874
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:09,390
looked at the box or the,

1875
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:09,990
you know,

1876
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:10,980
Denzel Washington was,

1877
00:47:10,981 --> 00:47:12,240
I think Denzel Washington.

1878
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,100
He looks like a very good athlete.

1879
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:15,150
Moves very well,

1880
00:47:15,151 --> 00:47:19,350
but it looks more like Daniel
Day Lewis is a real boxer.

1881
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:21,390
If we base it on their movie rules,

1882
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:22,843
then uh,

1883
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:27,510
Daniel Day Lewis held out long time
as John proctor and the crucible.

1884
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:33,370
Denzel Washington,

1885
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,530
one of the best actors ever,

1886
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:36,120
right?

1887
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:36,880
When you say,

1888
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,391
Oh God,

1889
00:47:37,391 --> 00:47:37,571
yeah.

1890
00:47:37,571 --> 00:47:39,380
And you know what they gave them when?

1891
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,190
When they gave him the Oscar for a,

1892
00:47:42,191 --> 00:47:42,761
what was it?

1893
00:47:42,761 --> 00:47:43,900
You Know Kong?

1894
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:44,500
No,

1895
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,191
that was the thing.

1896
00:47:45,191 --> 00:47:46,350
They should have given them to them.

1897
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:46,571
Oh,

1898
00:47:46,571 --> 00:47:46,841
right,

1899
00:47:46,841 --> 00:47:47,081
right,

1900
00:47:47,081 --> 00:47:47,291
right.

1901
00:47:47,291 --> 00:47:48,280
That performance.

1902
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:52,090
If you ever go watch Malcolm Max footage,

1903
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:52,391
you know,

1904
00:47:52,391 --> 00:47:52,971
on Youtube,

1905
00:47:52,971 --> 00:47:55,060
but you can now they've got
tons of it and nothing but free.

1906
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:56,103
Fascinating.

1907
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,900
You look at that and
you realize like that.

1908
00:47:58,901 --> 00:48:01,990
Do you want to talk about a Denzel
Washington and up at six training like a

1909
00:48:01,991 --> 00:48:02,824
boxer,

1910
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:06,040
he didn't even have
youtube to pull clips from.

1911
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,200
He became Malcolm x.

1912
00:48:08,201 --> 00:48:09,280
The mannerisms,

1913
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:10,900
the way he holds his hand,

1914
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:11,590
uh,

1915
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:12,460
as he speaks,

1916
00:48:12,461 --> 00:48:12,940
it's in,

1917
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:13,751
it's crazy.

1918
00:48:13,751 --> 00:48:14,650
He should've gotten,

1919
00:48:14,651 --> 00:48:15,580
I think he got nominate.

1920
00:48:15,581 --> 00:48:16,660
He should've won that year.

1921
00:48:16,661 --> 00:48:17,440
He didn't.

1922
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,000
Then they gave it to him years later for,

1923
00:48:19,001 --> 00:48:21,740
to a King Kong and got nothing on me.

1924
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:23,260
The training day,

1925
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:24,123
training day,

1926
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:25,750
which he was really good in it.

1927
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:26,441
That's the thing.

1928
00:48:26,441 --> 00:48:27,274
He's like,

1929
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:29,080
I remember when they
first gave him the award,

1930
00:48:29,081 --> 00:48:29,831
I hadn't seen the movie.

1931
00:48:29,831 --> 00:48:30,131
I was like,

1932
00:48:30,131 --> 00:48:30,311
oh,

1933
00:48:30,311 --> 00:48:32,890
they're making up for fucking
overlooking Malcolm x.

1934
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,760
But then you see his performance in
that movie and what could be a simple

1935
00:48:36,761 --> 00:48:38,080
programmer or a simple,

1936
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:38,561
a good guy,

1937
00:48:38,561 --> 00:48:39,394
bad guy.

1938
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,800
He ticked that role to the next level.

1939
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:42,670
Um,

1940
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:46,480
so it may have been overdue payback
for a fantastic performance.

1941
00:48:46,481 --> 00:48:47,920
He didn't get enough credit for,

1942
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,690
but I think he earned that 10.

1943
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:50,140
I agree.

1944
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,070
A hundred training day.

1945
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:51,701
I agree.

1946
00:48:51,701 --> 00:48:53,170
100% this performance alone.

1947
00:48:53,171 --> 00:48:53,500
Yeah.

1948
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:53,791
He,

1949
00:48:53,791 --> 00:48:54,624
he,

1950
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:56,770
he legitimately seem like a corrupt cop.

1951
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,280
Yeah.

1952
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:57,580
He,

1953
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:58,420
he becomes it.

1954
00:48:58,421 --> 00:48:59,470
He's the one of those guys.

1955
00:48:59,471 --> 00:49:00,980
It was Russell Crowe guys sick.

1956
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,720
You believe sociopathic and like
him giving them the like smoking.

1957
00:49:04,721 --> 00:49:05,051
Then he's like,

1958
00:49:05,051 --> 00:49:07,710
you're smoking the wet
and like he enjoyed it.

1959
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:08,820
He was a little malicious.

1960
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:10,123
Seem real.

1961
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:12,220
Very real when he was enjoying it.

1962
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:12,761
Yeah.

1963
00:49:12,761 --> 00:49:13,120
I mean to,

1964
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,730
to put your minds that place
to allow yourself to go there.

1965
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:17,590
You've got to get real close to crazy.

1966
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,750
You got to get right next
door neighbors to crazy.

1967
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,560
You got to see crazy every morning
when you're getting any cars morning.

1968
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:23,050
Crazy.

1969
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:24,110
What's the crazy issues?

1970
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:25,490
Who's who you worked with?

1971
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,790
Like I've seen someone go to that place.

1972
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,880
We on RedState we would Michael Parks.

1973
00:49:30,881 --> 00:49:33,790
I don't think I've ever said Michael
Parks and Melissa Leo went to weird places

1974
00:49:33,791 --> 00:49:35,290
like incredible places where I'm like,

1975
00:49:35,291 --> 00:49:35,800
Oh shit,

1976
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,950
this is other worldly stuff
like true fucking actors,

1977
00:49:38,951 --> 00:49:39,191
man.

1978
00:49:39,191 --> 00:49:41,950
True across the Michael
Parks is the preacher.

1979
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:42,843
Yeah.

1980
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:43,751
This and folks,

1981
00:49:43,751 --> 00:49:45,940
if you see one movie this year,

1982
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,260
see red state,

1983
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:50,230
it's Kevin wants me to this movie.

1984
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:50,660
Now listen,

1985
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,080
I had known that Eo thing.

1986
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,840
I knew nothing of what this movie was.

1987
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:56,590
I had no idea and I showed up.

1988
00:49:56,591 --> 00:50:01,540
I showed up with Aubrey and we had not
a fucking clue in the world as to what

1989
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:02,201
this movie is about.

1990
00:50:02,201 --> 00:50:05,770
I assumed it was a comedy and
I heard some whisper online.

1991
00:50:05,771 --> 00:50:07,720
I heard it was a horror
film question mark.

1992
00:50:07,721 --> 00:50:08,554
That's all I saw.

1993
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:13,620
So I go in with an awesome blank
slate and it halfway into the movie,

1994
00:50:14,351 --> 00:50:14,681
I'm like,

1995
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:16,750
what the fuck is going on?

1996
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:17,681
I'm like,

1997
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,810
it may be 35 45 minutes in.

1998
00:50:19,811 --> 00:50:20,261
I was like,

1999
00:50:20,261 --> 00:50:22,660
this is the craziest fucking,

2000
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:24,880
this is Kevin Smith's movie.

2001
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,450
It's seats.

2002
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:27,110
You don't even,

2003
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:31,130
it's like you have to throw out everything
you think of as a Kevin Smith movie.

2004
00:50:31,131 --> 00:50:32,510
Kevin Smith movies are always fun.

2005
00:50:32,511 --> 00:50:33,344
Comedies,

2006
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:34,071
you know,

2007
00:50:34,071 --> 00:50:39,071
in this movie just gets so fucking
crazy so quick and just keeps and goes.

2008
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:41,541
And you know,

2009
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:42,200
I really,

2010
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,210
I appreciate so much about that movie,

2011
00:50:44,211 --> 00:50:45,500
but what I really,

2012
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:46,250
well,

2013
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:49,460
the one thing that's staggering right
off the bat was that guy who played the

2014
00:50:49,461 --> 00:50:49,970
preacher,

2015
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:51,670
Michael Parks of Mosley.

2016
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:54,500
If that guy doesn't get
nominated for the academy award,

2017
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:56,060
he loves so much attention,

2018
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:56,620
uh,

2019
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:57,381
fuck awards,

2020
00:50:57,381 --> 00:50:57,651
right?

2021
00:50:57,651 --> 00:50:57,980
Fuck,

2022
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:59,630
fuck theW who cares?

2023
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:00,481
You know,

2024
00:51:00,481 --> 00:51:00,710
it's,

2025
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:01,260
I mean,

2026
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:05,060
to a seven year old man or this business
turned its back on a long time ago and

2027
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:09,290
clearly has better chops and most of
his peers who went on to other things,

2028
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,060
it means something.

2029
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:12,343
That award,

2030
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,020
it may not mean shit to me,

2031
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:15,890
like me getting awards,

2032
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:16,461
but him,

2033
00:51:16,461 --> 00:51:18,230
that award means something and it's still,

2034
00:51:18,231 --> 00:51:21,430
he comes from an era where it
does mean it does mean so well.

2035
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,160
I wish we could substitute that with the,

2036
00:51:23,161 --> 00:51:24,560
the greater opinion of,

2037
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:25,423
you know,

2038
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:26,750
whatever people,

2039
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:30,290
nice people all across the country
and people discerning individuals.

2040
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:33,860
If you watch this movie and don't think
this guy's a fucking super genius,

2041
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,960
all that Shit that I said
about Daniel Day Lewis,

2042
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:39,140
the exact same shit I'm
saying about this guy,

2043
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:40,480
one of those right there,

2044
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:45,900
he was playing this fucking preacher and
he had this one long non cut monologue.

2045
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:53,560
I mean the camera is on him for a long
fucking time and it's all one run and

2046
00:51:54,381 --> 00:51:55,820
it's brilliant.

2047
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:57,620
It's brilliant.

2048
00:51:57,770 --> 00:52:01,490
He sucks you in to the point
where you're shitting your,

2049
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:02,031
you know,

2050
00:52:02,031 --> 00:52:02,864
this is going to,

2051
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:05,120
something terrible is going to happen.

2052
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:08,060
You don't know when you
don't know what and it keeps,

2053
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:13,120
he just holds you there with this
conviction in this character and this

2054
00:52:13,191 --> 00:52:16,580
character is belief that is fucking scary.

2055
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,170
It's fucking scary.

2056
00:52:18,171 --> 00:52:18,470
There's,

2057
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:18,951
you know,

2058
00:52:18,951 --> 00:52:20,360
there's imminent death.

2059
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:20,900
Yeah.

2060
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,460
Like it's set up right there,

2061
00:52:22,461 --> 00:52:25,640
but his performance is so riveting.

2062
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:26,803
He's so,

2063
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:30,380
so fucking good at the
craft that you'll put,

2064
00:52:30,381 --> 00:52:32,570
cause the movie's moving along
at a nice clip right there.

2065
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:34,790
We put the movie on pause and be like,

2066
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:35,624
Ladies and gentlemen,

2067
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:36,351
Michael Parks,

2068
00:52:36,351 --> 00:52:38,660
and it does a fucking
essentially a guitar Solo,

2069
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,880
the Most Amazing Guitar
Solo you've ever heard.

2070
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:42,290
And rather than be like,

2071
00:52:42,291 --> 00:52:42,981
move on,

2072
00:52:42,981 --> 00:52:45,560
fucking get to the murders
that we knew were coming.

2073
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:47,360
People that kicked back and go like,

2074
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:48,320
oh my God,

2075
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:49,460
that's so beautiful.

2076
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:52,400
And he finishes his solo
and the movie begins again.

2077
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:52,701
It's,

2078
00:52:52,701 --> 00:52:54,860
it's pretty weird.

2079
00:52:54,861 --> 00:52:55,850
It's pretty astounding.

2080
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:56,721
Guitar Solo.

2081
00:52:56,721 --> 00:52:59,150
What kind of music you or you saw it.

2082
00:52:59,151 --> 00:52:59,541
It's him.

2083
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:00,141
It's his voice.

2084
00:53:00,141 --> 00:53:01,970
I'm talking about a metaphorical,

2085
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:04,160
oh Jesus Christ and I was so high.

2086
00:53:04,161 --> 00:53:05,120
More stone than me.

2087
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:06,860
I must be possible cause you keep going.

2088
00:53:06,861 --> 00:53:08,300
You keep going and
dragging me in with you.

2089
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:09,441
I'm telling you,

2090
00:53:09,441 --> 00:53:10,201
I've been around at all.

2091
00:53:10,201 --> 00:53:11,540
Vege wow.

2092
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:12,440
I'm an idiot.

2093
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,400
This ain't even happening.

2094
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:14,810
We're in this meditation tech.

2095
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,210
You're in the meditation tank and
we're just having this conversation.

2096
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:19,670
How did that character come about?

2097
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:20,511
Oh yeah,

2098
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,100
for sure.

2099
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,540
I'll let you know how the
character coming back at that guy,

2100
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,630
Fred Phelps.

2101
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:25,040
What?

2102
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:25,980
How much of this church

2103
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:30,980
guy and basically that that dude created
that character for me that create the

2104
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:33,660
movie for you a little bit.

2105
00:53:33,661 --> 00:53:36,120
I mean it was kind of a
two or three pronged thing.

2106
00:53:36,121 --> 00:53:36,960
Like number one,

2107
00:53:36,961 --> 00:53:39,450
I saw parks in from dusk till dawn,

2108
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:44,340
which was a Quinton's movie with Robert
Rodriguez and he's in the opening 10

2109
00:53:44,341 --> 00:53:44,671
minutes.

2110
00:53:44,671 --> 00:53:45,780
He's astounding.

2111
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,321
Like the,

2112
00:53:46,321 --> 00:53:47,170
the this I,

2113
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,090
I love acting.

2114
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:49,440
I love actors,

2115
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:50,221
love people,

2116
00:53:50,221 --> 00:53:50,940
actresses,

2117
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,470
people that could take the words off page,

2118
00:53:52,471 --> 00:53:53,304
Meghan Sing.

2119
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:54,031
But you know,

2120
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:56,160
there's only so many ways
to skin a cat and fucking,

2121
00:53:56,161 --> 00:53:57,490
even the best of him,

2122
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:00,090
pretty much like concede
the strings and whatnot.

2123
00:54:00,091 --> 00:54:01,200
You know how acting works.

2124
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:05,250
Every once in a while you meet one of
these performers or see of her former,

2125
00:54:05,251 --> 00:54:06,840
you're lucky you get to meet him.

2126
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:10,110
It takes it off the fucking
grid off the charts.

2127
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,810
This guy does this and
the opening of this movie,

2128
00:54:12,811 --> 00:54:14,780
which from dusk till
dawn is a fun vampire,

2129
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,200
fucking Romp Romp.

2130
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:16,920
Rather,

2131
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,190
this guy comes in and drops a
performance that could have won.

2132
00:54:20,191 --> 00:54:24,870
It showed him in a fair just world would
have won a supporting Oscar nomination.

2133
00:54:24,871 --> 00:54:25,704
Like you know,

2134
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:30,030
Judi Dench gets one for Shakespeare
in love and she's in the movie.

2135
00:54:30,031 --> 00:54:30,331
What?

2136
00:54:30,331 --> 00:54:31,620
Seven or nine minutes?

2137
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:33,510
Parks in from dusk till dawn,

2138
00:54:33,511 --> 00:54:38,130
roughly the same time and
gives a performance that's
as electric as believable

2139
00:54:38,131 --> 00:54:39,210
as off the charts.

2140
00:54:39,211 --> 00:54:39,601
Wonderful.

2141
00:54:39,601 --> 00:54:40,321
But you know,

2142
00:54:40,321 --> 00:54:42,900
it's a genre film so he don't
get the attention and stuff.

2143
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:44,580
This guy fell in love with him.

2144
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,350
I'm watching a from dusk till dawn,

2145
00:54:46,351 --> 00:54:47,670

2146

Thank you Manny [inaudible] and VIP.

2149
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:54,510
It's movie has a Gaf.

2150
00:54:54,511 --> 00:54:55,260
Fuck Alan.

2151
00:54:55,260 --> 00:55:00,260
I see the vampire movie and I went to go
see this vampire movie made by Quentin

2152
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:01,590
Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez.

2153
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:04,140
But what I left there was with,

2154
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:06,180
I have to work with that man.

2155
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,650
I don't know who that fucking man is.

2156
00:55:07,651 --> 00:55:10,230
That sheriff guy in the
first 10 minutes who?

2157
00:55:10,231 --> 00:55:10,741
Spoilers,

2158
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:11,161
spoilers,

2159
00:55:11,161 --> 00:55:11,550
movies.

2160
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:12,630
Fucking 16 years old,

2161
00:55:12,631 --> 00:55:14,310
but just in case he gets killed,

2162
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,350
the first fucking 10 minutes whole movie.

2163
00:55:16,351 --> 00:55:16,621
I'm like,

2164
00:55:16,621 --> 00:55:17,191
no.

2165
00:55:17,191 --> 00:55:19,170
That dude was the fucking truth.

2166
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,520
The absolute truth.

2167
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,750
I walk out of that theater,

2168
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:21,961
I go,

2169
00:55:21,961 --> 00:55:25,740
I got to work with that guy to sit at
the fucking feet of a Yoda like that.

2170
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,870
And like for a month on a set,

2171
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:32,430
you man imagining my mouth fucking
information you can glean steel fucking

2172
00:55:32,431 --> 00:55:33,330
benefit from.

2173
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:34,500
He's pure,

2174
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:38,910
pure genius enacting form a clear
genius when you're watching him.

2175
00:55:38,911 --> 00:55:41,130
It's so spectacular and riveting.

2176
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:42,380
So good.

2177
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:44,880
I told them there were
days on set like I did.

2178
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,700
We didn't do many takes at
all because we were just,

2179
00:55:47,701 --> 00:55:47,970
you know,

2180
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:51,060
we didn't have a lot of money and
she was low budget movie and when the

2181
00:55:51,061 --> 00:55:53,020
performances are that
good man got John Gum,

2182
00:55:53,021 --> 00:55:53,761
I'm Melissa Leo,

2183
00:55:53,761 --> 00:55:54,780
you've got parks,

2184
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:56,610
the crushing it take one and shit.

2185
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:57,511
So you know,

2186
00:55:57,511 --> 00:55:58,620
I'll leave it up to them and they're like,

2187
00:55:58,621 --> 00:55:59,371
I'm good if you're good.

2188
00:55:59,371 --> 00:55:59,611
I'm like,

2189
00:55:59,611 --> 00:56:00,211
I know I got,

2190
00:56:00,211 --> 00:56:03,570
I don't direct the movie as much as I
sit there and edit it in my head on set.

2191
00:56:03,571 --> 00:56:05,910
And because you don't direct Michael
Parkinson when willing to do go up to him

2192
00:56:05,911 --> 00:56:06,630
and be like,

2193
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:08,970
here's how I do it based on my experience.

2194
00:56:08,971 --> 00:56:10,650
Plants Silent Bob over the years.

2195
00:56:10,651 --> 00:56:12,270
Did he ad libbed any of that?

2196
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:12,931
Oh yeah.

2197
00:56:12,931 --> 00:56:16,830
He got in there and definitely seemed
like he could probably just start talking

2198
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:17,760
in that guy.

2199
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:18,600
Uh,

2200
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:22,200
he sees so in tune with
that fucking character man.

2201
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:22,560
Yeah,

2202
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,050
he was,

2203
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:23,231
well,

2204
00:56:23,231 --> 00:56:23,650
he,

2205
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:25,420
he had that script for what,

2206
00:56:25,421 --> 00:56:25,661
two,

2207
00:56:25,661 --> 00:56:29,170
three months ahead of time by the
time he came to the set and I have no,

2208
00:56:29,171 --> 00:56:30,790
I'm not the author of that performance.

2209
00:56:30,791 --> 00:56:34,300
I got authored his own performance
hands down there across the boards.

2210
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:36,820
You don't direct the movie like Red State.

2211
00:56:36,821 --> 00:56:38,140
You just let it happen.

2212
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:40,090
But all they should keep it on the tracks.

2213
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,860
This dude's like his,

2214
00:56:41,861 --> 00:56:42,550
uh,

2215
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:43,120
he would,

2216
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,880
he had the script for a while
when he came to the set.

2217
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:47,171
He is like,

2218
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:47,440
can I,

2219
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,310
can I have the space?

2220
00:56:48,311 --> 00:56:49,390
Can you show them into space?

2221
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,370
And we brought them to
the chapel and whatnot.

2222
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:53,050
They were still putting the
finishing touches on it,

2223
00:56:53,051 --> 00:56:57,910
but he kind of did a a laid out like
the way you would lay out a dance.

2224
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:01,420
He essentially kind of didn't say the
dialogue out loud but he would just sit

2225
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:04,120
there and you'd watch them kind of moving
his arms and stuff and it looked like

2226
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:07,960
he was slowly waltzing by himself and
they'd stop somewhere and ask somebody,

2227
00:57:07,961 --> 00:57:08,800
put a mark here,

2228
00:57:08,801 --> 00:57:09,261
blah blah blah.

2229
00:57:09,261 --> 00:57:10,094
I'll put a mark here.

2230
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,100
Then he put it all together.

2231
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:16,300
I got to see what he was doing the next
morning he had choreograph this fucking

2232
00:57:16,301 --> 00:57:16,660
thing.

2233
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,760
Like he could do it from top to bottom.

2234
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,310
Like he could do the entire scene,

2235
00:57:21,311 --> 00:57:22,750
which was I think in the script.

2236
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:24,340
12 pages,

2237
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:28,690
12 pages of dialogue or
something ridiculous like
that and he could fucking do

2238
00:57:28,691 --> 00:57:29,800
it from beginning to end.

2239
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:31,660
And you watch him hit his marks.

2240
00:57:31,661 --> 00:57:33,640
He knew exactly where
he wanted to ban stuff.

2241
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:36,970
So much so that like I had done a draft
right before shooting and I was like,

2242
00:57:36,971 --> 00:57:37,271
hey man,

2243
00:57:37,271 --> 00:57:39,070
this is the new version of the sermon.

2244
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,450
And he fucking bristled.

2245
00:57:40,451 --> 00:57:40,931
Cause he was like,

2246
00:57:40,931 --> 00:57:41,110
no,

2247
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:41,171
no,

2248
00:57:41,171 --> 00:57:41,471
no,

2249
00:57:41,471 --> 00:57:41,801
no.

2250
00:57:41,801 --> 00:57:44,050
I mean that's other stuff's great.

2251
00:57:44,051 --> 00:57:44,861
What do you need this for?

2252
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:45,370
Blah Blah.

2253
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:47,800
And what I realized was
because he was dialed in,

2254
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:50,800
like he knew what was going to
happen when you hit that stage.

2255
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:54,850
He knew where to be so that he could
just let his art come out of his mouth.

2256
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,760
But he was still framing the movie for us,

2257
00:57:56,761 --> 00:57:57,870
still commanding the stage.

2258
00:57:57,871 --> 00:57:58,451
It's a movie,

2259
00:57:58,451 --> 00:57:59,590
let's keep things moving.

2260
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:02,650
He wasn't content to just stand
there and deliver dialogue,

2261
00:58:02,651 --> 00:58:05,140
which he could have and he still
would have fucking captivated you.

2262
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:07,480
Instead he choreographed his movement.

2263
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:08,360
Um,

2264
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:08,470
it,

2265
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:08,660
it,

2266
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:09,940
it was fantastic.

2267
00:58:09,941 --> 00:58:12,940
He was a dude that just
gave beyond given you,

2268
00:58:12,941 --> 00:58:13,211
you know,

2269
00:58:13,211 --> 00:58:13,371
I,

2270
00:58:13,371 --> 00:58:15,640
I wrote it with him in mind going,

2271
00:58:15,641 --> 00:58:18,490
I know what it's gonna sound like cause
I'm a big fan of the students' work now.

2272
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:20,110
And even getting to the set,

2273
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:23,500
he would still deliver over
what I heard in my head.

2274
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:23,710
Like,

2275
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:24,070
oh,

2276
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:24,611
like I remember,

2277
00:58:24,611 --> 00:58:27,430
I'll never forget what a month,

2278
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:29,560
month before we start shooting,

2279
00:58:29,561 --> 00:58:33,730
where in my kitchen's May John Gordon
is Bruce through the movie and um,

2280
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:37,210
and parks and we're just talking about
when we're going to go and it takes a

2281
00:58:37,211 --> 00:58:38,260
while to get money together.

2282
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:41,740
And so we're leaving the kitchen and
that we're talking about something in the

2283
00:58:41,741 --> 00:58:44,410
script and he stops and he goes,

2284
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:48,520
he drew delivers one of the lines
and he delivers it so flawlessly.

2285
00:58:48,521 --> 00:58:53,350
And it was the first time I heard
parks do what would be avian Cooper.

2286
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:54,730
And so I was like,

2287
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:55,421
oh my God,

2288
00:58:55,421 --> 00:58:55,751
parks.

2289
00:58:55,751 --> 00:58:57,340
My heart skipped a beat and shit.

2290
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:59,340
He left and I turned to John Gordon.

2291
00:58:59,350 --> 00:58:59,741
I was like,

2292
00:58:59,741 --> 00:58:59,951
dude,

2293
00:58:59,951 --> 00:59:01,120
he's going to win an award.

2294
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:02,350
I don't know what it is,

2295
00:59:02,351 --> 00:59:04,810
but like there's no way
people don't cite him.

2296
00:59:04,811 --> 00:59:06,670
It was like it for that one line,

2297
00:59:06,671 --> 00:59:07,590
he slipped into a,

2298
00:59:07,591 --> 00:59:08,424
and Cooper,

2299
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:09,461
you could hear it.

2300
00:59:09,461 --> 00:59:12,550
You can the Gravitas of the
life that Michael Parks has led,

2301
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:14,860
informing like every,

2302
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:19,570
every job he did or didn't get an
entire life brought to bear on this,

2303
00:59:19,571 --> 00:59:20,050
he gave him,

2304
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:21,680
he gave a monster soul.

2305
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,420
Like you look at that
character on the page,

2306
00:59:23,421 --> 00:59:24,350
very two dimensional,

2307
00:59:24,351 --> 00:59:25,790
easy to hey Michael,

2308
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:27,530
put a sole on them where you know,

2309
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:28,281
you still hate them,

2310
00:59:28,281 --> 00:59:29,114
but you're like,

2311
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:30,740
oh there's this somebody under there.

2312
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,041
You know,

2313
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:32,990
he's not just like a
two dimensional cartoon.

2314
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,550
You could easily write off.

2315
00:59:34,551 --> 00:59:38,000
He brought something to it and I wanted
him to do two dimensional cartoon.

2316
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:39,171
Like I was just like,

2317
00:59:39,171 --> 00:59:40,490
I'm gonna put you in track suits.

2318
00:59:40,491 --> 00:59:42,920
Cause that's what Fred
Phelps wears and you know,

2319
00:59:42,921 --> 00:59:43,760
you could talk like him.

2320
00:59:43,761 --> 00:59:44,061
He goes,

2321
00:59:44,061 --> 00:59:44,781
I don't want to do that.

2322
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:46,510
If you want me to do
Fred Phelps impression,

2323
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:47,800
get somebody else who's gone,

2324
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:48,050
man,

2325
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:48,950
it's fucking boring.

2326
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:49,641
He's like,

2327
00:59:49,641 --> 00:59:50,421
I came to act.

2328
00:59:50,421 --> 00:59:51,141
I was like right on.

2329
00:59:51,141 --> 00:59:53,030
And he did charismatic instead.

2330
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:54,013
Wow.

2331
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:54,741
He's a dude,

2332
00:59:54,741 --> 00:59:54,891
man.

2333
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:55,760
He don't fuck around.

2334
00:59:55,761 --> 00:59:57,270
This is a duty as a straight shooter,

2335
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:58,640
you seven years old,

2336
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:00,650
he's not pulling punches.

2337
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:03,020
He's going to tell you exactly
are you fucking feels and he,

2338
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:05,900
what is it that have Bisbee
a little intimidating though
when you have that kind

2339
01:00:05,901 --> 01:00:06,800
of a conversation with him.

2340
01:00:06,801 --> 01:00:08,030
You wanted him to do that though,

2341
01:00:08,031 --> 01:00:08,301
right?

2342
01:00:08,301 --> 01:00:08,490
Yeah.

2343
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:12,080
I wanted him to do all this
because of him and like he'll give,

2344
01:00:12,081 --> 01:00:12,440
you know,

2345
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,750
like I'm a grown up so
I can take good ideas,

2346
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:16,010
leave stuff behind.

2347
01:00:16,011 --> 01:00:18,110
He gave me the wonderful
idea of seen the movie.

2348
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:23,240
Like it ends with somebody going shut
the fuck up from off camera without

2349
01:00:23,241 --> 01:00:23,661
spoilers,

2350
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:24,490
spoilers.

2351
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:25,323
Um,

2352
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:26,930
that came from parks.

2353
01:00:26,931 --> 01:00:27,830
It wasn't in the script,

2354
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:28,491
it was just,

2355
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:29,324
you know,

2356
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:31,700
just ended where it
kinda ended without that.

2357
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:32,841
And parks was like,

2358
01:00:32,841 --> 01:00:36,440
how about instead you go off of
me and I'm trying to be vague.

2359
01:00:36,441 --> 01:00:37,340
So it was not to spoil it,

2360
01:00:37,341 --> 01:00:38,530
but I hope you remember
what I'm talking about.

2361
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:43,530
I do totally go off of me singing and
then you go down to another cell and there

2362
01:00:44,601 --> 01:00:45,434
you are,

2363
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:46,341
you know,

2364
01:00:46,341 --> 01:00:46,910
and,

2365
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:47,760
and you see,

2366
01:00:47,761 --> 01:00:48,740
given away way too much.

2367
01:00:48,741 --> 01:00:50,330
Your movie right now it's a little bit,

2368
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:51,290
but again,

2369
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:52,130
I said spoilers,

2370
01:00:52,131 --> 01:00:54,320
but I tune out folks.

2371
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,213
Yeah.

2372
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:55,731
But anyway,

2373
01:00:55,731 --> 01:00:58,340
he goes to you say blah blah blah.

2374
01:00:58,341 --> 01:00:59,174
He said that line.

2375
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:00,470
And I was just like,

2376
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,280
um,

2377
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:06,170
I said parks I would love to but I think
it'd be weird in this moment I saw,

2378
01:01:06,171 --> 01:01:07,430
I liked the idea that line.

2379
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:07,941
I said,

2380
01:01:07,941 --> 01:01:09,830
but cutting to me in the movie,

2381
01:01:09,831 --> 01:01:10,940
I'm not in the movie.

2382
01:01:10,941 --> 01:01:14,870
And I think people would take
people out of the movie and he goes,

2383
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:15,704
why?

2384
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:19,220
And I was gone because people would
recognize me and he goes from what?

2385
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:21,500
And I realize like,

2386
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:22,440
oh my gosh guys,

2387
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:24,020
like not,

2388
01:01:24,021 --> 01:01:27,650
he has no clue that like I've had this
whole other career as far as he knows

2389
01:01:27,651 --> 01:01:28,780
that it's red state and red.

2390
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:30,980
So he only knows I made some movies,

2391
01:01:30,981 --> 01:01:32,210
has no idea what they are,

2392
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,530
didn't know I was in them or anything.

2393
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:34,400
That was so sweet.

2394
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:35,750
It was going in pure,

2395
01:01:35,751 --> 01:01:36,411
you know what I'm saying?

2396
01:01:36,411 --> 01:01:40,610
Like this dude went in all about the
craft and he drops science on that

2397
01:01:40,611 --> 01:01:41,300
performance.

2398
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:43,760
And he would sit there from
time to time like and be like,

2399
01:01:43,761 --> 01:01:44,780
can I grab one more take?

2400
01:01:44,781 --> 01:01:45,201
And I'd be like,

2401
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:45,950
parks,

2402
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:47,300
you can have as many takes as you want.

2403
01:01:47,301 --> 01:01:49,700
We're literally all here because of you.

2404
01:01:49,701 --> 01:01:52,130
Because I saw that performance
and from dusk till dawn.

2405
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:56,300
So it was kind of like the whole
movie was kind of a parks celebration.

2406
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:56,750
You know,

2407
01:01:56,750 --> 01:02:00,830
people that didn't know him fell in love
with them as we made the movie because

2408
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:06,220
the dude just every day you
were awed by something he did.

2409
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:07,610
But you were sitting there going,

2410
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,300
oh my God.

2411
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,340
Like do you remember when he
started singing in the movie?

2412
01:02:10,341 --> 01:02:14,090
At one point we had the whole chapel,

2413
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:14,271
you know,

2414
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:16,140
everyone in the chapel singing and,

2415
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:16,850
and I said,

2416
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:17,180
uh,

2417
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:18,270
for some other part of the movie,

2418
01:02:18,271 --> 01:02:18,501
he said,

2419
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:19,334
Hey man,

2420
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:19,620
uh,

2421
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:21,870
while this thing's going
on over here on camera,

2422
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,070
I'm going to push in on you.

2423
01:02:23,071 --> 01:02:25,500
You want to sing one of
those Gospel hymnals.

2424
01:02:25,501 --> 01:02:27,570
Cause he picked the other
one old rugged cross.

2425
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:28,291
I said,

2426
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:29,580
you got another one you want to go with?

2427
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,511
And he's like,

2428
01:02:30,511 --> 01:02:30,991
yeah man,

2429
01:02:30,991 --> 01:02:32,550
the AUC can sink farther along.

2430
01:02:32,551 --> 01:02:33,121
You want that?

2431
01:02:33,121 --> 01:02:33,480
And I was like,

2432
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:33,631
yeah,

2433
01:02:33,631 --> 01:02:34,381
whatever shirt.

2434
01:02:34,381 --> 01:02:35,214
Totally.

2435
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:36,031
And we shoot them,

2436
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:38,430
we're pushing in on him
and he sings farther along.

2437
01:02:38,431 --> 01:02:39,410
And it's Kinda is,

2438
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:40,253
it is in the movie.

2439
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:41,700
He's got this beautiful soulful voice.

2440
01:02:41,701 --> 01:02:42,900
The men had made records.

2441
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:43,801
So,

2442
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:44,634
um,

2443
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:45,510
oh,

2444
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:45,871
it's,

2445
01:02:45,871 --> 01:02:48,300
it sweeps me off my feet
and it's a church song,

2446
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:49,470
but I'm still weighing into it.

2447
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,060
Next day I come into work,

2448
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:56,220
everyone on set periodically here and go
my father alone and they're all singing

2449
01:02:56,221 --> 01:02:57,040
it and I'm like,

2450
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:57,601
it's good.

2451
01:02:57,601 --> 01:02:57,931
I said,

2452
01:02:57,931 --> 01:02:58,231
right?

2453
01:02:58,231 --> 01:02:58,411
Like,

2454
01:02:58,411 --> 01:02:59,221
it's catchy to like,

2455
01:02:59,221 --> 01:02:59,401
yeah,

2456
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:01,590
for Jesus Song is pretty catchy and stuff.

2457
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:04,200
So he brought that to
it to the elements of,

2458
01:03:04,201 --> 01:03:05,270
of singing charisma,

2459
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,240
charisma.

2460
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:07,410
And that's what he went for.

2461
01:03:07,411 --> 01:03:09,270
He said he wanted to
play it as a charismatic,

2462
01:03:09,271 --> 01:03:11,910
he had this whole backstory for like,

2463
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:12,780
you know,

2464
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:14,640
his not only even Cooper's father,

2465
01:03:14,641 --> 01:03:15,331
but his grandfather,

2466
01:03:15,331 --> 01:03:15,571
he was like,

2467
01:03:15,571 --> 01:03:15,691
oh,

2468
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:17,130
he's very close with his grandfather,

2469
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,060
wrote a backstory.

2470
01:03:18,061 --> 01:03:19,710
He's himself to create for the care.

2471
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:20,070
Yeah,

2472
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:21,120
he told me he's just like,

2473
01:03:21,121 --> 01:03:21,954
look,

2474
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:25,410
he was tight with his grandfather and
his grandfather was still fire and

2475
01:03:25,411 --> 01:03:26,244
brimstone,

2476
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:27,450
who's charismatic,

2477
01:03:27,451 --> 01:03:31,020
but he was still strict but
it's grandfather is still
also had a sense of humor

2478
01:03:31,021 --> 01:03:31,570
for the kid.

2479
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:33,450
So his grandfather would
be the one in the kitchen,

2480
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,360
you know,

2481
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:38,520
pulling like a train whistle down with
had one fist and lifting a leg and fart

2482
01:03:38,521 --> 01:03:39,181
and with the other.

2483
01:03:39,181 --> 01:03:44,040
So we were still kind of human so he
loved his grandfather had Cooper even

2484
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:46,470
though we premium preached the
holy word and he loved them for it.

2485
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:48,750
His father also preached the holy word,

2486
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:49,230
this,

2487
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:51,340
this killed me cause parks
going on all eloquently.

2488
01:03:51,341 --> 01:03:52,050
It goes,

2489
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:53,700
his father also preached the holy word,

2490
01:03:53,701 --> 01:03:54,990
but he probably touched his dick.

2491
01:03:54,991 --> 01:03:56,790
So we don't talk about his father ever.

2492
01:03:57,620 --> 01:03:58,081
I was like,

2493
01:03:58,081 --> 01:03:59,460
that's astounding dude.

2494
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:00,101
That's amazing.

2495
01:04:00,101 --> 01:04:01,530
You just bizarre.

2496
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:02,490
But he gave it thought,

2497
01:04:02,491 --> 01:04:04,560
he gave thought into
buying the outfit duty,

2498
01:04:04,561 --> 01:04:08,060
went out and picked out to the
the wardrobe with Beth costume.

2499
01:04:08,061 --> 01:04:10,110
A wardrobe person picked every piece.

2500
01:04:10,111 --> 01:04:12,000
She was us like never
really done that before.

2501
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:12,301
Ghana,

2502
01:04:12,301 --> 01:04:12,511
you know,

2503
01:04:12,511 --> 01:04:14,730
gone out with girls who are
looking for a specific sizes,

2504
01:04:14,731 --> 01:04:18,240
but he right down to the
underwear and the socks.

2505
01:04:18,241 --> 01:04:22,300
The dude had to be involved in picking
the choices that what aid he fell

2506
01:04:22,330 --> 01:04:22,810
represented.

2507
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:23,100
Yeah.

2508
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:24,300
And he put the outfit together.

2509
01:04:24,301 --> 01:04:26,620
I remember the first time she showed
me a picture of him in the office,

2510
01:04:26,621 --> 01:04:30,040
Beth Beth up past Beth Beth pock.

2511
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:30,450
Anyway,

2512
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:31,110
regardless,

2513
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:33,450
best shows me pictures of uh,

2514
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:34,770
a bin and um,

2515
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:36,570
and in his outfit,

2516
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,360
Michael Parks and I'm going,

2517
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:40,411
oh man,

2518
01:04:40,411 --> 01:04:41,340
that ain't it at all.

2519
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,480
I was looking for a track suit,

2520
01:04:42,481 --> 01:04:45,780
like this dude wearing Khakis
and button down shirt and a tie.

2521
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:47,160
It looks like a school teacher.

2522
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:47,970
And I had,

2523
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:48,211
you know,

2524
01:04:48,211 --> 01:04:48,750
had written,

2525
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:51,240
I'd read state in my
brain for like five years,

2526
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:51,541
you know,

2527
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:52,590
wrote a five years ago.

2528
01:04:52,591 --> 01:04:54,840
And I'd always had very specific
idea of what he looked like,

2529
01:04:54,841 --> 01:04:56,760
which was stolen from
the look of Fred Phelps.

2530
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:59,850
And I remember going like,

2531
01:04:59,851 --> 01:05:00,631
I dunno man,

2532
01:05:00,631 --> 01:05:00,811
like,

2533
01:05:00,811 --> 01:05:01,680
how do I adjust this?

2534
01:05:01,681 --> 01:05:02,580
I don't want him to wear this.

2535
01:05:02,581 --> 01:05:03,060
And she,

2536
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:03,511
she was like,

2537
01:05:03,511 --> 01:05:05,100
you might want to go with it.

2538
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:09,570
He's dialed into the costume and it was
such a good choice because the clothes

2539
01:05:09,571 --> 01:05:10,410
made the man like,

2540
01:05:10,411 --> 01:05:11,440
I don't even know how else to say.

2541
01:05:11,441 --> 01:05:12,274
I did sound,

2542
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,350
it sounds Corny,

2543
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:14,700
but the,

2544
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:18,430
the outfit made him just allowed
to do what he had to do up there.

2545
01:05:18,431 --> 01:05:21,040
He felt like if you see
him early in the movie,

2546
01:05:21,041 --> 01:05:24,460
at one point he's at the protests holding
the cup of coffee outside is wearing

2547
01:05:24,461 --> 01:05:25,450
just a jacket,

2548
01:05:25,451 --> 01:05:26,860
a windbreaker and a tee shirt or some,

2549
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:28,750
but whenever he spoke the holy word,

2550
01:05:28,751 --> 01:05:29,584
he would put on what,

2551
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:30,070
you know,

2552
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:33,430
his Sunday best essentially
and this was his Sunday best,

2553
01:05:33,431 --> 01:05:36,910
like the button down shirt with a
tie and he believed in presenting,

2554
01:05:36,911 --> 01:05:39,250
particularly if you're going to go
up there and preach the holy word,

2555
01:05:39,251 --> 01:05:43,240
you should look respectable and bullet
all this philosophy behind just the

2556
01:05:43,241 --> 01:05:47,950
outfit and the whole time I feared it
until we want in front of cameras and I

2557
01:05:47,951 --> 01:05:48,191
was like,

2558
01:05:48,191 --> 01:05:49,180
this looks beautiful.

2559
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:53,800
Like the outfit is perfect and in some
weird way because it gives him this just

2560
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:58,720
air of respectability and that makes the
shit coming out of his mouth that much

2561
01:05:58,721 --> 01:05:59,590
more heinous.

2562
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:00,820
I realize I'm still standing.

2563
01:06:00,821 --> 01:06:01,970
So he was uh,

2564
01:06:04,110 --> 01:06:04,390
yeah,

2565
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:04,830
he's uh,

2566
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:06,550
that guy's a unique talent.

2567
01:06:06,551 --> 01:06:09,640
It's hard to believe that
it's taken them this long for,

2568
01:06:09,641 --> 01:06:10,140
um,

2569
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:10,780
Mo,

2570
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:13,180
it's taken me this long
to find out who he is.

2571
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:13,831
You know,

2572
01:06:13,831 --> 01:06:15,760
like why doesn't America,

2573
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:19,720
Quentin and Robert Quentin Tarantino
particularly made that guy charming,

2574
01:06:19,721 --> 01:06:20,554
quick story.

2575
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:24,880
I love the story because shows you that
we're all like fucking kids in this

2576
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:25,714
business.

2577
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:28,870
We go see the movie acquaintance
guys own fucking movie theaters.

2578
01:06:28,871 --> 01:06:30,730
House looks like a fucking
real movie theater,

2579
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:32,140
movie seats,

2580
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:33,640
fucking popcorn shit.

2581
01:06:33,641 --> 01:06:36,970
And he's got these awesome sculptures
from his movies all around by this artist

2582
01:06:36,971 --> 01:06:37,840
named cleat shields.

2583
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:40,530
Great own personal movement there.

2584
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:43,330
Sits about 50 or 60 or something
like that and maybe a little less.

2585
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:46,030
So we go watch red state.

2586
01:06:46,031 --> 01:06:46,810
There's me,

2587
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:47,890
Gwen and parks,

2588
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:48,903
Michael Parks.

2589
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:50,501
And he liked it.

2590
01:06:50,501 --> 01:06:51,430
He liked it.

2591
01:06:51,431 --> 01:06:52,410
See they really loved,

2592
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:53,201
I don't want to oversell it,

2593
01:06:53,201 --> 01:06:54,880
but he dug the movies so much.

2594
01:06:54,881 --> 01:06:58,180
He watched it without us
when he wasn't supposed to.

2595
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:59,940
Like he got the print two days early.

2596
01:06:59,941 --> 01:07:02,790
We're supposed to watch it with them the
day that we joined him and he was like,

2597
01:07:02,791 --> 01:07:03,581
I'm gonna be honest with you.

2598
01:07:03,581 --> 01:07:05,350
I watched her ready twice.

2599
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:06,200
Fucking love it.

2600
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:06,401
You know,

2601
01:07:06,401 --> 01:07:06,701
I was like,

2602
01:07:06,701 --> 01:07:07,061
oh the,

2603
01:07:07,061 --> 01:07:09,940
you don't have to apologize but
us fucking awesome and shit.

2604
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:12,520
So he watched it with us again.

2605
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:14,380
Then afterwards he goes,

2606
01:07:14,381 --> 01:07:15,490
come in the house and you know,

2607
01:07:15,491 --> 01:07:18,430
cause the theaters separate from the
house and he brings us in the house and

2608
01:07:18,431 --> 01:07:20,110
this fucking charmed me.

2609
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:21,400
I will never forget this.

2610
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:22,790
He goes,

2611
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:23,950
I got to show you my tape.

2612
01:07:23,951 --> 01:07:25,690
I got to show you my Michael Parks tape.

2613
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:27,550
And he goes into,

2614
01:07:27,551 --> 01:07:27,761
you know,

2615
01:07:27,761 --> 01:07:29,080
he's got a big entertainment centers,

2616
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:31,540
DVDs everywhere and stuff
hightech everywhere.

2617
01:07:31,541 --> 01:07:33,250
But he also still has VHS.

2618
01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:38,500
Dude lays hands on a fucking VHS tape
almost as if I thought I hit the fucking

2619
01:07:38,501 --> 01:07:42,310
flux capacitor cause I haven't seen one
in a while and they're scribble on the

2620
01:07:42,311 --> 01:07:43,570
fucking side and marker.

2621
01:07:43,571 --> 01:07:46,510
Because remember we used to ride on the
side of our video tapes when we made our

2622
01:07:46,511 --> 01:07:47,344
own tapes.

2623
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:48,820
Um,

2624
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:49,151
Beth,

2625
01:07:49,151 --> 01:07:53,770
the best of Michael Parks and Quentin
throws this tape in and what it is,

2626
01:07:53,771 --> 01:07:56,560
is he such a fan of this guy's work,

2627
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:57,461
he loves him.

2628
01:07:57,461 --> 01:07:59,290
Gone back to then came Bronson.

2629
01:07:59,291 --> 01:08:01,990
He loves this dude's work so much.

2630
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:06,610
Anytime this dude's going to turn
up on TV or it gets a video of him,

2631
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:11,910
he v he records from tape to tape or
from TV to tape the segments of his

2632
01:08:13,301 --> 01:08:14,170
performance,

2633
01:08:14,171 --> 01:08:17,870
everything that Michael Parks and
particularly the highlights and shit.

2634
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:22,730
So what you have is a collection of
like some of the cheesiest exploitation,

2635
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:24,500
straight to TV movies or straight,

2636
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:24,951
you know,

2637
01:08:24,951 --> 01:08:29,540
Blake about of high school volleyball
team or college volleyball team and stuff

2638
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:29,991
like that.

2639
01:08:29,991 --> 01:08:31,250
Murder mysteries and whatnot,

2640
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:33,320
like real programmers.

2641
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:36,860
And as he's shown you the clips,

2642
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:39,710
even though it's
programmers all around him,

2643
01:08:39,711 --> 01:08:44,210
Michael Parks is still in each one of
these scenes that Quentin is pulled off

2644
01:08:44,211 --> 01:08:48,980
and put onto this VHS dropping science
performance science where you're just

2645
01:08:48,981 --> 01:08:49,640
like,

2646
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:50,570
this is crazy.

2647
01:08:50,571 --> 01:08:54,180
Like this dude's doing Shakespeare
in the middle of Shit and yeah,

2648
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:55,010
not to put off,

2649
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:55,251
you know,

2650
01:08:55,251 --> 01:08:57,980
anybody who made those movies
down or off or whatever,

2651
01:08:57,981 --> 01:09:01,640
but clearly like everyone
else has kind of like,

2652
01:09:01,641 --> 01:09:01,911
you know,

2653
01:09:01,911 --> 01:09:05,870
here we are collecting a check and that
is about the best furthest we can go.

2654
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:09,020
And this dude is like crushing it,

2655
01:09:09,021 --> 01:09:09,854
crushing it.

2656
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:10,970
Like what movies?

2657
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:11,960
A lot of TV,

2658
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:16,010
I don't even know them do Darl TV movies
from like the sixties and seventies is

2659
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:19,490
a little bit into the 80s and
that's what Quentin had collected.

2660
01:09:19,491 --> 01:09:20,271
He would like this,

2661
01:09:20,271 --> 01:09:22,970
he's got an encyclopedic knowledge of,

2662
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:25,580
of cinema and even bad trash cinema.

2663
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:26,840
There is no such trash,

2664
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:28,940
such thing as trashed cinema to this guy.

2665
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:34,450
He watched that movie and he found gold
like diamonds in the midst of Shit that

2666
01:09:34,821 --> 01:09:37,850
was just maybe simple or
fucking program and material.

2667
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:42,560
And he collected them for years on a
fucking VHS tape long before he ever knew

2668
01:09:42,561 --> 01:09:43,730
he would be a filmmaker,

2669
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:47,390
long before he ever knew
he'd meet Michael Parks,

2670
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,760
let alone become a film maker,

2671
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:53,930
make movies with Michael Parks and them
direct Michael Parks and inspire me to

2672
01:09:53,931 --> 01:09:56,780
make a fucking movie where I
put Michael Parks in it like he,

2673
01:09:56,781 --> 01:09:57,531
that's what he said to me.

2674
01:09:57,531 --> 01:09:58,220
It's like,

2675
01:09:58,220 --> 01:09:58,941
oh my God,

2676
01:09:58,941 --> 01:10:00,590
he's gone as a Michael Parks Fan,

2677
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:01,610
I love this.

2678
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:01,990
This is an,

2679
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:02,130
Oh,

2680
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:03,620
this is the ultimate Michael Parks movie.

2681
01:10:03,621 --> 01:10:03,861
I was like,

2682
01:10:03,861 --> 01:10:04,281
right,

2683
01:10:04,281 --> 01:10:05,114
right.

2684
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,200
So for me it was,

2685
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:07,040
that was,

2686
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,690
I loved that the tape dude,

2687
01:10:08,691 --> 01:10:09,800
he still had it.

2688
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:13,160
If he had just told us the
story of ice to this tape,

2689
01:10:13,161 --> 01:10:13,431
man,

2690
01:10:13,431 --> 01:10:14,264
when I had the best,

2691
01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:15,830
that would have been cool enough,

2692
01:10:15,831 --> 01:10:16,041
dude.

2693
01:10:16,041 --> 01:10:20,000
But he produced it and we all watched
it together and I sat in a chair off to

2694
01:10:20,001 --> 01:10:24,480
the side and him and park sat
on a couch and it was there.

2695
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:27,860
I would've rolled the tier if it wouldn't
have embarrassed him both or made them

2696
01:10:27,861 --> 01:10:28,694
be able to get out.

2697
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:29,600
Um,

2698
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,000
but there they were like the man whose,

2699
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:33,380
whose work that this kid,

2700
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:35,570
filmmaker loved so much.

2701
01:10:35,571 --> 01:10:38,270
Think about the shit you made
mix tapes of when you were a kid.

2702
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:42,830
He made him this guy's performance and
there he is watching that very same tape

2703
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:44,870
with the guy on the tape,

2704
01:10:44,871 --> 01:10:45,260
the WHO,

2705
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:45,591
you know,

2706
01:10:45,591 --> 01:10:46,580
the actor he loves.

2707
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:46,881
Oh,

2708
01:10:46,881 --> 01:10:47,714
it was touching.

2709
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:48,711
That's inspiring.

2710
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:51,410
But it's also inspiring that
this guy's like Tarantino out.

2711
01:10:51,411 --> 01:10:53,150
They're real enthusiasts,

2712
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:53,601
you know,

2713
01:10:53,601 --> 01:10:58,601
due to get really fucking super excited
about some shit and that's like you

2714
01:10:58,641 --> 01:10:58,941
with,

2715
01:10:58,941 --> 01:11:00,710
with fucking MMA or whatever.

2716
01:11:00,711 --> 01:11:01,011
Fuck.

2717
01:11:01,011 --> 01:11:04,010
Like the shit that you're into your
super into you get geeky about.

2718
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:04,421
Yeah.

2719
01:11:04,421 --> 01:11:04,730
Yeah.

2720
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:06,830
He does Kiki fucking movies.

2721
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:10,100
And that passion will translate
to an audience for everything.

2722
01:11:10,101 --> 01:11:10,271
When,

2723
01:11:10,271 --> 01:11:10,370
uh,

2724
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:11,480
whenever it is that you're doing,

2725
01:11:11,481 --> 01:11:11,621
man,

2726
01:11:11,621 --> 01:11:12,860
I never want to see a fucking,

2727
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:14,640
you was UFC,

2728
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:15,743
UFC fight,

2729
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:16,321
but you,

2730
01:11:16,321 --> 01:11:19,740
when you talked about it in the shower
was just like when you came on our show,

2731
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:20,671
I was like,

2732
01:11:20,671 --> 01:11:20,850
Oh,

2733
01:11:20,850 --> 01:11:21,091
you know,

2734
01:11:21,091 --> 01:11:22,410
I would go see this now.

2735
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:23,580
Like you,

2736
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,350
when you talk about it with the passion,

2737
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:30,330
enthusiasm you do translates to somebody
who was never sold before and I wasn't

2738
01:11:30,331 --> 01:11:31,590
even on the fence really.

2739
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:33,300
But then when I watch you talk about,

2740
01:11:33,301 --> 01:11:33,481
I'm like,

2741
01:11:33,481 --> 01:11:34,560
this motherfucker's smart.

2742
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:37,740
Like he's one of the smartest dudes I
ever met that everyone was running the

2743
01:11:37,741 --> 01:11:38,411
organizations.

2744
01:11:38,411 --> 01:11:38,570
Yeah,

2745
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:39,081
intelligent.

2746
01:11:39,081 --> 01:11:39,340
It's,

2747
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:39,710
it's,

2748
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:42,590
it's a totally different
thing than what people expect.

2749
01:11:42,830 --> 01:11:43,000
Right?

2750
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,660
Hear the term cage fighting.

2751
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:45,321
You think,

2752
01:11:45,321 --> 01:11:45,561
well,

2753
01:11:45,561 --> 01:11:46,550
there's going to be a bunch of,

2754
01:11:46,551 --> 01:11:46,821
you know,

2755
01:11:46,821 --> 01:11:48,980
barbaric assholes and you know,

2756
01:11:48,981 --> 01:11:49,081
and,

2757
01:11:49,081 --> 01:11:49,251
and,

2758
01:11:49,251 --> 01:11:50,750
and mean people beaten up.

2759
01:11:50,751 --> 01:11:51,650
Other mean people.

2760
01:11:51,651 --> 01:11:53,120
That's not what it is at all.

2761
01:11:53,170 --> 01:11:53,690
I mean,

2762
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:54,201
what it is,

2763
01:11:54,201 --> 01:11:59,120
is people that are trying to attempt to
do the most difficult thing in all of

2764
01:11:59,121 --> 01:11:59,810
sport.

2765
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:04,810
Put your body and your health at risk to
go after another person's body and shut

2766
01:12:05,871 --> 01:12:06,860
it down and taken out.

2767
01:12:06,861 --> 01:12:08,510
It's the craziest game of all time.

2768
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:10,580
But it's the oldest game of all time.

2769
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:12,230
Male dominance over other men.

2770
01:12:12,231 --> 01:12:12,740
And look,

2771
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:15,770
we have a society where
obviously that's illegal.

2772
01:12:15,771 --> 01:12:16,221
You can't,

2773
01:12:16,221 --> 01:12:17,420
you can't beat people up.

2774
01:12:17,421 --> 01:12:17,841
You can't.

2775
01:12:17,841 --> 01:12:18,291
It's good.

2776
01:12:18,291 --> 01:12:19,700
We want everything to be civilized,

2777
01:12:19,701 --> 01:12:20,210
we want,

2778
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:22,220
but in the midst of evolution,

2779
01:12:22,221 --> 01:12:23,320
when we find ourselves in this,

2780
01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:28,330
this stage along the way from changing
from a a wild animal to a conscious

2781
01:12:29,001 --> 01:12:29,630
being,

2782
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:33,830
we still got a lot of chimpanzee DNA that
needs to be satisfied and there's one

2783
01:12:33,831 --> 01:12:34,760
or two ways to do it.

2784
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,230
Either you can suppress it,

2785
01:12:36,231 --> 01:12:37,640
you can pretend it doesn't exist,

2786
01:12:37,641 --> 01:12:42,530
or you can give it something like porn
or violence on television and movies and

2787
01:12:42,531 --> 01:12:42,810
in,

2788
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:43,061
in,

2789
01:12:43,061 --> 01:12:43,311
in,

2790
01:12:43,311 --> 01:12:43,521
in,

2791
01:12:43,521 --> 01:12:43,821
in,

2792
01:12:43,821 --> 01:12:44,654
in sports.

2793
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:47,360
You could give it something
to live vicariously through.

2794
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:48,920
I like porn.

2795
01:12:48,950 --> 01:12:49,560
Yes.

2796
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:49,820
If,

2797
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:50,001
cause,

2798
01:12:50,001 --> 01:12:52,620
if you don't have these other ways
to live vicariously through it,

2799
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:53,930
there's only one other way around it.

2800
01:12:53,931 --> 01:12:55,780
You have to go find whatever
it is you're looking for,

2801
01:12:55,790 --> 01:12:57,620
whether it's fine violence or find sex.

2802
01:12:58,010 --> 01:13:00,350
But if you can get violence
and sex and a television form,

2803
01:13:00,351 --> 01:13:02,030
you can eliminate it from real life.

2804
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:03,830
The Japanese have believed this forever.

2805
01:13:03,831 --> 01:13:05,240
The Japanese believe that you know,

2806
01:13:05,241 --> 01:13:09,950
you're much more likely to commit a
heinous sexual crimes if it's difficult to

2807
01:13:09,951 --> 01:13:10,784
get laid.

2808
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:11,310
You know,

2809
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:12,380
there's so freaky over there.

2810
01:13:12,381 --> 01:13:15,320
You can buy used women's
panties and dispensers.

2811
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:16,581
It's ridiculous.

2812
01:13:16,581 --> 01:13:17,271
You put some cash,

2813
01:13:17,271 --> 01:13:18,104
you buy underwear.

2814
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,140
Porn is,

2815
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:20,950
there's no pubic hair.

2816
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,290
It's only nipples.

2817
01:13:22,291 --> 01:13:25,260
And even those are kind of
very strange shaking out.

2818
01:13:25,261 --> 01:13:28,230
But their animation and their comic books.

2819
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,580
Yeah.

2820
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:30,780
Fucking like intense.

2821
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:31,620
A lot of bondage.

2822
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:33,410
Giant Cox two,

2823
01:13:33,470 --> 01:13:34,190
yeah.

2824
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:35,460
Giant vein later.

2825
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:36,620
Not Allowed to see hair,

2826
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:37,140
pubic hair.

2827
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:38,150
So bizarre.

2828
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:38,840
Yeah,

2829
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:39,673
they have a,

2830
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:40,850
it's an,

2831
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:45,850
it's got to be weird when an entire
country looks so similar physically.

2832
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:46,761
I mean,

2833
01:13:46,761 --> 01:13:49,580
obviously you can tell the difference
between one Japanese guy to another.

2834
01:13:49,581 --> 01:13:51,170
I know a lot of Japanese people,

2835
01:13:51,171 --> 01:13:56,171
but essentially the vast majority of the
people that live in Japan have this one

2836
01:13:57,021 --> 01:13:58,100
look dark hair.

2837
01:13:58,101 --> 01:13:58,431
You know,

2838
01:13:58,431 --> 01:13:58,641
the,

2839
01:13:58,641 --> 01:13:58,880
the,

2840
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,110
the Japanese look,

2841
01:14:00,111 --> 01:14:00,321
I mean,

2842
01:14:00,321 --> 01:14:02,090
they are a clear race,

2843
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:02,811
you know,

2844
01:14:02,811 --> 01:14:07,040
it's gotta be so strange to be a
part of such a specific ethnicity.

2845
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:07,940
Like I'm a Mutt.

2846
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:09,740
You look like you're probably a month.

2847
01:14:09,770 --> 01:14:10,460
You're a mud.

2848
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:10,671
You know,

2849
01:14:10,671 --> 01:14:11,710
we're a combinations.

2850
01:14:11,711 --> 01:14:13,030
I'm a little bit of Irish,

2851
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:13,864
a little bit of Italian,

2852
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:14,420
but you know,

2853
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:15,370
I'm just a white guy,

2854
01:14:15,371 --> 01:14:15,611
you know,

2855
01:14:15,611 --> 01:14:16,444
to most people.

2856
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:17,041
But when you,

2857
01:14:17,041 --> 01:14:17,440
you know,

2858
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:20,770
Japanese people like Dan
is a very clear race,

2859
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:25,980
has got to be very strange to be a part
of like a real powerful dominant like,

2860
01:14:27,310 --> 01:14:27,880
you know what I'm saying?

2861
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:28,061
Like,

2862
01:14:28,061 --> 01:14:28,630
it's like,

2863
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:29,560
like you look at like,

2864
01:14:29,561 --> 01:14:29,800
uh,

2865
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:30,633
like,

2866
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:32,650
like it's some Italians,

2867
01:14:32,651 --> 01:14:33,820
you can see this and you know,

2868
01:14:33,821 --> 01:14:33,991
you,

2869
01:14:33,991 --> 01:14:34,211
you,

2870
01:14:34,211 --> 01:14:34,991
you look at them and go,

2871
01:14:34,991 --> 01:14:37,690
oh clearly that guys some
sort of an Italian guy,

2872
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:38,261
you know?

2873
01:14:38,261 --> 01:14:40,270
Or if not he's Armenian
or something like that,

2874
01:14:40,271 --> 01:14:40,810
you know,

2875
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:42,220
that the sort of dark look.

2876
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:45,490
But it could be a bunch of different
things Japanese guys look like Japanese

2877
01:14:45,491 --> 01:14:45,910
guys,

2878
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:46,570
you know,

2879
01:14:46,570 --> 01:14:49,840
if you understand what like the
w with Asian people look like,

2880
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:51,070
you know,

2881
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:52,570
Koreans have a different look to them.

2882
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:53,091
But it's,

2883
01:14:53,091 --> 01:14:56,170
it must be interesting to
be a part of like one of,

2884
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:56,471
I mean,

2885
01:14:56,471 --> 01:14:58,480
how many millions of
Japanese people are there,

2886
01:14:58,990 --> 01:14:59,351
you know,

2887
01:14:59,351 --> 01:15:02,950
and to have such a similar look with
all these different people that like you

2888
01:15:02,951 --> 01:15:05,860
that you could be recognized immediately
somewhere else in the country.

2889
01:15:05,861 --> 01:15:06,430
You know,

2890
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:08,290
I think it'd be awesome to have a culture,

2891
01:15:08,291 --> 01:15:09,580
like they have a culture.

2892
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:10,630
Oh if you feel like we,

2893
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:12,010
I mean we have pop culture,

2894
01:15:12,011 --> 01:15:13,840
which thank God cause
that's why I have a job,

2895
01:15:13,841 --> 01:15:18,841
but they have a culture that goes back
eons and we don't really didn't add them

2896
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:19,260
in.

2897
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:19,571
And as,

2898
01:15:19,571 --> 01:15:20,590
as White Mutts,

2899
01:15:20,591 --> 01:15:24,130
we don't really have a
culture that goes back eons.

2900
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:27,310
What always impressed me about the
Japanese is the culture of discipline.

2901
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,750
They've had this culture of,

2902
01:15:28,751 --> 01:15:30,970
of discipline and of martial arts.

2903
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:31,571
You know,

2904
01:15:31,571 --> 01:15:32,381
the discipline of,

2905
01:15:32,381 --> 01:15:32,681
of,

2906
01:15:32,681 --> 01:15:36,940
of war and strategy like way before any
of the European countries ever figured

2907
01:15:36,941 --> 01:15:38,080
out what the fuck was going on.

2908
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:38,800
Right.

2909
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,160
You know,

2910
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:39,840
the,

2911
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:40,600
this Shogun,

2912
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:45,100
this tattoo that I have on my arm is
Miyamoto Musashi battling a tiger.

2913
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:46,100
This is a,

2914
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:48,040
this famous Samurai guy.

2915
01:15:48,130 --> 01:15:48,963
And um,

2916
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,790
he wrote this book called
the Book of five rings.

2917
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,500
Some amazing book man,

2918
01:15:53,501 --> 01:15:56,440
where you got to get into this
guy's head that he's living,

2919
01:15:56,441 --> 01:15:58,750
I believe it was the 15th century.

2920
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:00,910
So I think it was like the 14 hundreds.

2921
01:16:00,911 --> 01:16:01,060
I'm,

2922
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:02,550
I might be wrong with what he,

2923
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,180
whenever he was writing this book,

2924
01:16:04,181 --> 01:16:07,810
basically he was a Ronin so
he would travel the earth.

2925
01:16:07,811 --> 01:16:08,501
He had no,

2926
01:16:08,501 --> 01:16:08,770
uh,

2927
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:09,431
no master.

2928
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:10,390
He had no emperor.

2929
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:15,010
So he was traveling the earth basically
having fucking sword fights with people.

2930
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:20,370
He had like 60 duals one-on-one duels
with other men and killed them and hand to

2931
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:23,170
hand one on one combat.

2932
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:24,161
I mean,

2933
01:16:24,161 --> 01:16:26,650
it's a crazy thought and thinking
about killing people with swords.

2934
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:29,740
This guy did until like
60 different guys swords.

2935
01:16:29,741 --> 01:16:30,010
And in,

2936
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:31,210
in some situations he,

2937
01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:33,160
he thought swords are too easy.

2938
01:16:33,161 --> 01:16:33,781
So he would use,

2939
01:16:33,781 --> 01:16:37,420
he would let them use a sword and he
would use a stick and he was fucking,

2940
01:16:37,421 --> 01:16:39,070
it was a fascinating character,

2941
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:40,390
but his,

2942
01:16:40,870 --> 01:16:43,630
his whole life was based on unbalance.

2943
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:44,830
It was about art,

2944
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:46,540
it was about philosophy,

2945
01:16:46,541 --> 01:16:47,374
it was about,

2946
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:50,050
it was about seeking the correct way.

2947
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:51,490
And for him,

2948
01:16:51,491 --> 01:16:54,640
the way of the sword was simply
the way to be successful.

2949
01:16:54,641 --> 01:16:59,110
The most successful movements in any
given situation as far as what combat is.

2950
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:02,560
But he acquainted this
combat to artistic integrity,

2951
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,260
the ability to create things freely,

2952
01:17:05,410 --> 01:17:07,270
the ability to draw and paint,

2953
01:17:07,271 --> 01:17:09,010
the ability to write poetry and and,

2954
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:10,010
and to elegantly

2955
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:11,270
express your feelings.

2956
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:11,961
To him,

2957
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:13,370
it was all connected.

2958
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:17,990
It was all one piece of excellence and
that is like a guide to live your life

2959
01:17:17,991 --> 01:17:18,680
by.

2960
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:19,790
And he had this,

2961
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:20,061
this,

2962
01:17:20,061 --> 01:17:24,110
this statement that I read when I
was a kid and I always stuck with me.

2963
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:26,300
Once you understand the way broadly,

2964
01:17:26,301 --> 01:17:28,040
you can see it in all things.

2965
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:29,240
And the idea,

2966
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:32,390
the idea being that once you find
out how to tap into anything,

2967
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:34,790
it's like find out how to
be a great movie director.

2968
01:17:34,791 --> 01:17:35,900
Find out how to be a,

2969
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:38,600
a great guy draws animation,

2970
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:39,770
a fucking singer.

2971
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:41,960
Would a chess player and say it again,

2972
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:42,910
say you're fine.

2973
01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:43,460
The,

2974
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:45,710
once you understand the way broadly,

2975
01:17:45,711 --> 01:17:47,600
you can see it in all things.

2976
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:49,640
This is a translation from Japanese,

2977
01:17:49,641 --> 01:17:52,040
so it's not probably not totally accurate,

2978
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:53,171
but what,

2979
01:17:53,171 --> 01:17:53,420
what,

2980
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:55,700
that's what he meant is
that you find greatness.

2981
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:57,320
You find greatness as a carpenter,

2982
01:17:57,321 --> 01:17:59,180
you find greatness as a Samurai.

2983
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:04,340
Does that same thing when you just tap
into the zone where you're just really

2984
01:18:04,341 --> 01:18:09,050
tuning into whatever the fuck you're
doing and then you let creativity sort of

2985
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:10,520
spread it out for you.

2986
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:12,260
Comes better with age too,

2987
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:13,103
doesn't it?

2988
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:17,090
But it's just like it
comes with awareness.

2989
01:18:17,091 --> 01:18:19,010
I think blue awareness and
not even just with age.

2990
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:22,730
I think the age is just experience and
that's awareness or eventually a quick

2991
01:18:22,810 --> 01:18:23,300
learners.

2992
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:24,890
I don't think it's
necessarily just an age.

2993
01:18:24,891 --> 01:18:26,620
There's a lot of people that
they get older and they,

2994
01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:29,600
they put that box closer
and closer to their head.

2995
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:30,080
You know,

2996
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,940
they want to see less
and less of the world.

2997
01:18:32,370 --> 01:18:32,900
It's,

2998
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:33,890
it's all your,

2999
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,240
you're seeking as well.

3000
01:18:35,241 --> 01:18:37,460
You're not trapped in some
sort of a box every day,

3001
01:18:37,461 --> 01:18:38,540
so as you get older,

3002
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:39,630
of course you're,

3003
01:18:39,630 --> 01:18:41,780
you're going to get
more tuned into things.

3004
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:43,610
You're constantly still
asking the questions.

3005
01:18:43,611 --> 01:18:45,380
You're not trapped in a slave box.

3006
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,330
I used to be a destination guy.

3007
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:50,480
I talked about it with Mosher
on spot cost quite a bit.

3008
01:18:50,481 --> 01:18:52,910
Back in the day I was destination.

3009
01:18:52,911 --> 01:18:54,710
He was very journey oriented.

3010
01:18:54,711 --> 01:18:55,131
For him.

3011
01:18:55,131 --> 01:18:56,240
It was all about like,

3012
01:18:56,510 --> 01:18:56,871
hey man,

3013
01:18:56,871 --> 01:18:58,310
everything's a journey and you know,

3014
01:18:58,311 --> 01:19:01,040
it's like the journey is the
fucking fun and Blah Blah Blah.

3015
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:01,761
And I was like,

3016
01:19:01,761 --> 01:19:02,630
no destination,

3017
01:19:02,631 --> 01:19:03,171
get there.

3018
01:19:03,171 --> 01:19:06,860
I just want to get to where we're
supposed to be in the last few years.

3019
01:19:06,861 --> 01:19:11,830
I flipped and now I am kind of like the
journey is more important to me and know

3020
01:19:11,831 --> 01:19:12,351
why that is.

3021
01:19:12,351 --> 01:19:13,790
Why cause you're rich as fuck.

3022
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,160
Oh we did that too.

3023
01:19:16,161 --> 01:19:17,540
But it's also you're successful.

3024
01:19:17,870 --> 01:19:19,100
You don't have to worry about it anymore.

3025
01:19:19,101 --> 01:19:19,281
Yeah,

3026
01:19:19,281 --> 01:19:20,450
you're fucking Kevin Smith.

3027
01:19:20,451 --> 01:19:23,780
He got 2 million friends on
follow followers on Twitter.

3028
01:19:24,230 --> 01:19:25,880
You can talk to them whenever you want to.

3029
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:27,080
They want to come and see your movies.

3030
01:19:27,081 --> 01:19:29,480
You're in this weird zone where you
don't have to give a fuck anymore.

3031
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:29,800
Yeah.

3032
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:30,790
You know what it is.

3033
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:35,040
And I love the expression and I've it,

3034
01:19:35,090 --> 01:19:36,200
but they said,

3035
01:19:36,201 --> 01:19:36,680
uh,

3036
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:37,970
they said he doesn't,

3037
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:41,930
Kevin doesn't have to work for anyone
anymore cause he works for the audience.

3038
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:42,650
And I was like,

3039
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:43,131
Oh God,

3040
01:19:43,131 --> 01:19:43,851
that's perfect.

3041
01:19:43,851 --> 01:19:44,510
It's true.

3042
01:19:44,510 --> 01:19:45,051
That's it.

3043
01:19:45,051 --> 01:19:49,130
If you could get to that place
where it's not about like,

3044
01:19:49,131 --> 01:19:50,120
fuck everyone,

3045
01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:50,661
none of it.

3046
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:54,110
You don't rely on anybody for anything.

3047
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:56,060
It's all coming from within you,

3048
01:19:56,061 --> 01:19:57,200
your camp or something like that.

3049
01:19:57,201 --> 01:19:58,430
Not like there's no help.

3050
01:19:58,431 --> 01:20:00,050
Of course you get help within your world,

3051
01:20:00,051 --> 01:20:05,051
but do you know how comforting is it is
to know that I don't have to do prep.
