1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,250
And the new world order tentacles go deep,

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,030
deep,

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:03,480
deep,

4
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:03,931
deep.

5
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:06,330
Like a Dr Dre on a Tuesday.

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,940
I was going off yesterday.

7
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:21,020
I was saying how Joey Diaz will get mad
about catch up and have you ever heard

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,150
him talking about rats fucking hate red.

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,110
I don't know how the fuck
people delete that shit.

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,360
I don't know how people could be ranch.

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,340
I like when I go to a place and I say you,

12
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:32,040
oh you have wings and
they say clubs or ranch.

13
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,230
I get up and leave even
if I don't get the wings.

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,420
Because if you're going
to serve wings or ranch,

15
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:38,000
I don't want to do business with you.

16
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,310
Wings must be done with Gucci.

17
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:40,790
Gucci?

18
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:40,931
Yeah.

19
00:00:40,931 --> 00:00:42,510
Like the way of they invented in Buffalo,

20
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:45,150
New York and we got to
do what would original.

21
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,740
You're going to show up with that rest
that smells like somebody that she was

22
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,700
still same way.

23
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,640
Ranch is starting to replace ketchup.

24
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:50,821
Yeah.

25
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:51,270
That's good.

26
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,460
If you're fucking hillbilly and you
want the taste the ass in your mouth,

27
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,303
I'll fucking,

28
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,510
I hate that fucking race shit.

29
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,030
Don't pull it close to me.

30
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,770
Don't put it around me
and see the blue cheese.

31
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:03,160
We'll wings and go fuck him up.

32
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,360
That's the next year.

33
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,690
All right,

34
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,523
please.

35
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,480
He'll give you his album.

36
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:11,180
You know that Frank's long
and gives that albums.

37
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,460
He plays right here at fucking Malibu.

38
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,940
The Malibu in once a month.

39
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:15,774
He's got the blue.

40
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,550
You got to go as a goof on time.

41
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,160
All the Italian show up,

42
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:19,950
they kiss him.

43
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,440
What do you think his relationship
was like with his brother?

44
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,430
What do you think it would be?

45
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:24,200
It must be crazy.

46
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,100
Get the fuck Outta here.

47
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,190
Locked the door behind you and want to
invest in a cheeseburger chain and you're

48
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:30,210
going to be the head singer.

49
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,960
A great number of which are marijuana.

50
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:34,830
One in six,

51
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,800
one in jail are there from
about one in six people,

52
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:42,810
a victimless crime with people in
prison in six people in prison.

53
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,900
Just welcome me about what it,

54
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:46,621
it's a business.

55
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:47,371
What the fuck do you want?

56
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:48,750
Nobody knows prison is a business,

57
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,681
so all this shit,

58
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:51,360
you guys talked about
them checking the doors.

59
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,080
The feds,

60
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,950
I've never seen it.

61
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,390
I go get weed every day.

62
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,420
Stop scaring these fucking white
kids and getting them talking.

63
00:01:57,421 --> 00:01:58,260
This is nonsense.

64
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,090
But what are we getting
that I know it's illegal.

65
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:04,320
I know it should be legal and I know
that the John Lennon is gonna make a

66
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:05,100
comeback,

67
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,933
but for today,

68
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,290
for today,

69
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,180
2000 books that tonight.

70
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:09,621
Yeah,

71
00:02:09,621 --> 00:02:10,454
that's important.

72
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,330
It's not together with
Fallon and the presence hip,

73
00:02:13,331 --> 00:02:13,651
but what?

74
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:14,580
I don't give a fuck dawg.

75
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,721
I'm smoking.

76
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:15,961
Look,

77
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:16,794
look here.

78
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,480
Here's what I think about
your whole drug thing.

79
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:22,080
Looks like the same thing I've rubbed
my balls with for the last 32 years with

80
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:23,430
the sativas and the bullshit.

81
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,650
Just get high go.

82
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,263
You'll be breakthrough.

83
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,180
Much drama to the gift that God gave us.

84
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:30,920
Again,

85
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,201
there's,

86
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:31,800
there's been,

87
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,310
um,

88
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:32,910
you know,

89
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,330
a lot of people that are moving towards
a minimalist house is really small

90
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:37,650
houses and you know,

91
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:38,520
the idea is that like,

92
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:42,240
really why do we have to have this giant
fucking footprint of House that we live

93
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:44,430
in Rhode Island because
you're getting paid,

94
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:45,060
bitch,

95
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,590
if I want to live in a fucking cell,

96
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,390
I'm living a fucking sound like a monkey.

97
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,210
I'm going to live on a foldable
bed like I'm a shaded Bollix.

98
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,140
If you're getting paid,

99
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,460
you live in the fucking house.

100
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,250
I'm going to live in a Mike Rowe
fucking house with a little kitchen.

101
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:56,821
The pope,

102
00:02:56,821 --> 00:02:58,910
like I got a black guy
bagging me in a Badass.

103
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,790
I don't leave that a micro house.

104
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,110
What do you fucking people talking about?

105
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,550
I just snapped out of his dog.

106
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:05,190
You can't take me into
those deep waters like

107
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,250
Rika fucking kills a brother right now.

108
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,620
The fuck are used people,

109
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,490
Mike Micro houses in the fucking desert.

110
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,280
You play it out to the
world is like a doctor.

111
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,380
I want to live in one of their streams.

112
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,191
Brian's down.

113
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:18,910
Joey's not.

114
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,260
I think we have a real clear line.

115
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,780
I'm here with the new world champion

116
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:26,850
Jon Bones Jones.

117
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,900
I feel bad for that.

118
00:03:27,901 --> 00:03:28,640
Resilient.

119
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,020
You been at work on a 10th planet.

120
00:03:30,021 --> 00:03:30,480
Shit,

121
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,620
they're going to get bored and if
he's going to fucking brightness guys

122
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,840
dropping knowledge like a mother enemy.

123
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,230
He was a black lab.

124
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,600
There's so many stories like that,

125
00:03:48,601 --> 00:03:48,811
right?

126
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,230
If a guy going nuts over a check,

127
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,560
hey,

128
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,430
in the sixth grade by,

129
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,610
that's why we got to live in
back over New Yorker reasons.

130
00:03:53,611 --> 00:03:54,550
Boosie though that bus,

131
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:56,340
he sent me for a loop
with the sixth grade.

132
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,440
I couldn't even think I had quit karate.

133
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,510
I just stopped talking to my friends,

134
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,440
just banging out,

135
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,080
just bagging,

136
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,250
dry hump and I started drying up and I
was a little funnel teddies and then once

137
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:06,451
I got,

138
00:04:06,451 --> 00:04:07,500
she told me she wouldn't give him.

139
00:04:07,501 --> 00:04:10,020
She told me she wouldn't give
me a piece of bushy two a day,

140
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,250
first day after school.

141
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,460
I couldn't wait till the last
day of fucking sixth grade,

142
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,860
but my grades were so low at all.

143
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:20,370
That was on my mind was banging this chick
for three months and it finally I had

144
00:04:20,371 --> 00:04:21,204
to go to summer school.

145
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,191
Summer School,

146
00:04:23,191 --> 00:04:23,821
three days.

147
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:24,660
They leave you back.

148
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,000
I fucking even cut summer school.

149
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,481
Fuck it.

150
00:04:27,481 --> 00:04:28,314
This pussy served.

151
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,760
By that time she was giving me the push.

152
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:30,600
I didn't know what I was doing.

153
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:34,340
I was just looking at it and looking
at what the fuck was going on.

154
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,640
I was just doing little licks at it.

155
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,770
I was hoping it would meet me.

156
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,510
And then when I caught caught playing
hooky with that girl that the sixth grade,

157
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,320
cause we used to go to school and
then take off in the afternoons.

158
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:44,610
I go one day my mother's home,

159
00:04:44,611 --> 00:04:45,450
they fucking call.

160
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,670
So me and this girl lived caddy house.

161
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,120
Like there was a house behind mine next
to her so I could just jump the fence

162
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:52,410
and on the corner of being the house,

163
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,140
the windows were open and she's
out there yelling and screaming.

164
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,090
I had the mother's next
door and she's like,

165
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:57,890
Ooh Da.

166
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:58,651
That's what happens.

167
00:04:58,651 --> 00:04:59,071
Ever since.

168
00:04:59,071 --> 00:05:00,870
Your daughter's going to
hang on to hope my son

169
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,230
and they fuck all afternoon.

170
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,420
How to sub Dick,

171
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,100
who was killing my mother.

172
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:08,940
It was killing her.

173
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,620
It was killing the so much.

174
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:14,070
Even brought my uncle from California
one day because they couldn't figure out

175
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:14,970
what I was doing in the room.

176
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:17,250
So my uncle put a ladder
in the back of the house.

177
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,140
I ain't tried to climb up and shit.

178
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,700
Meanwhile I'm drawing a blank.

179
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,050
I'm rocking her fucking world.

180
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,220
That ladder fell.

181
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,280
He's done the audio meal.

182
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,490
I ate his meal,

183
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:27,650
his legs fucking Bro.

184
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,360
Like we're fixing pain.

185
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:33,210
Like I busted them write
out like a week later,

186
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:33,661
my mother is like,

187
00:05:33,661 --> 00:05:36,120
we're going to get you my brother.

188
00:05:36,121 --> 00:05:39,110
We're going to get you a little money to
your brother because you did something.

189
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,530
My mother blamed that on me.

190
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,150
Fucking hysterical.

191
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:42,901
Do you understand me?

192
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:44,980
What I went through with
this New Yorker reason ago.

193
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,100
Now she's on Facebook
and she won't talk to me.

194
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,990
I messaged the twice I even fucking farm.

195
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:51,171
Duh.

196
00:05:51,171 --> 00:05:51,751
You know what I'm saying?

197
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:52,380
Farmville.

198
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:57,380
Then he started going off
and he's screaming at me
on the phone after he at me

199
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:58,550
for leaving a message.

200
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,460
I fucked up and left a voicemail
message on his machine.

201
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,990
If you leave a message as machine,

202
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:05,120
he'll go crazy and call
you up and mother fuck you.

203
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,860
[inaudible] so if you call his voicemail,

204
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,733
oh

205
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:32,883
message.

206
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,550
I told them,

207
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,390
listen,

208
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,290
I have dressed

209
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,680
to school.

210
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:41,900
Good.

211
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,733
Okay.

212
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,510
Have a great day.

213
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,160
Eddie Bravo in the falcon line.

214
00:06:47,161 --> 00:06:47,994
Remember that

215
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,730
Eddie got mad at the Joey Diaz ones
cause Joey Diaz is the master of the one

216
00:06:53,731 --> 00:06:54,230
liner.

217
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,521
Yeah.

218
00:06:54,521 --> 00:06:54,790
You know,

219
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,710
and Eddie had this,

220
00:06:55,711 --> 00:06:56,190
uh,

221
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:56,431
you know,

222
00:06:56,431 --> 00:07:00,630
any like changed his look over the years
and became much more focused on his

223
00:07:00,631 --> 00:07:00,961
music,

224
00:07:00,961 --> 00:07:03,000
became much more rock and roll style.

225
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,210
And he had this big bracelet on.

226
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:06,600
It was nowhere leather bracelet.

227
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,230
Yeah.

228
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:07,860
And you know,

229
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,540
they're stylish people
like wearing them whatever.

230
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,440
But uh,

231
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,271
Joey Diaz is like,

232
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:12,410
what are you waiting for a fucking song,

233
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,453
Alana.

234
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,830
I remember I laughed so hard.

235
00:07:16,831 --> 00:07:18,930
He's fucking that transvestite joke.

236
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,640
One of the greatest jokes
anybody's ever sold on stage.

237
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:24,421
He goes,

238
00:07:24,421 --> 00:07:25,590
I like transvestites.

239
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,280
They Cook,

240
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,113
they clean,

241
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,051
they couldn't beat on him.

242
00:07:28,051 --> 00:07:31,080
Every once in a while the cops come who
they're going to believe me at some dude

243
00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:32,130
with a wig and a black guy.

244
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,370
There's no support
groups for these people.

245
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,500
Is the cops calm?

246
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,700
Who are they going to believe?

247
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:41,330
We sword booed a wig and a black guy

248
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,090
that's just,

249
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:44,520
you know,

250
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,320
that's this poetry man.

251
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:46,951
To me,

252
00:07:46,951 --> 00:07:48,780
that's poetry to checks his email.

253
00:07:48,781 --> 00:07:50,250
The guy is that guy in the,

254
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,030
what was that movie?

255
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:52,920
Leguizamo.

256
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:53,754
Son of Sam.

257
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,023
Yeah,

258
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,620
the BGS had Dan.

259
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,040
Can I tell you Joey
sitting down in the last,

260
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,180
I dunno,

261
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,013
five minutes.

262
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,340
You've already done what my
favorite Joey Diaz move is,

263
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:06,250
is it turns into a game shout we're,

264
00:08:06,251 --> 00:08:06,990
he'll go,

265
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,010
you know that movie?

266
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,210
Uh,

267
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,090
you know the movie.

268
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,220
It's like reverse 20 quests
that help joeys Stonehenge.

269
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,411
You know what?

270
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:20,490
I kidnapped that guy.

271
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:21,301
I kidnap them.

272
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:22,050
I did that.

273
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:22,883
I got four years.

274
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,000
I got all fucking easy.

275
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,670
They should have called me in
there for 10 fucking years,

276
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,020
but people don't really,

277
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,220
how much time did you actually do?

278
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,600
18 months.

279
00:08:30,601 --> 00:08:31,434
16 months.

280
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,490
Your freedom gets lost,

281
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:33,240
which sucks,

282
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,350
but it's the people at home.

283
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,230
It's not you or whatever.

284
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,630
I can do whatever the fuck it,

285
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,070
bro.

286
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,150
My jeans are from Cuba.

287
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:39,631
Motherfuckers.

288
00:08:39,631 --> 00:08:40,261
Tell me about,

289
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:41,100
I smoked the weed.

290
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,620
Castro smoked before he went
to the mountains to take over.

291
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,380
What's a typical day live in
like a doctor who liked it.

292
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,730
I became a standup comic.

293
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,790
I learned how to do standup killing
prisoners on Thursday nights.

294
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:51,810
They used to have movie night.

295
00:08:51,811 --> 00:08:52,644
I didn't even know that.

296
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,690
They used to have movie
that on Thursday night.

297
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,470
So the projector would
always fuck up like Ustream.

298
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,141
I would always go,

299
00:08:58,141 --> 00:08:59,500
what the fuck is wrong
with them projecting?

300
00:08:59,510 --> 00:08:59,610
No.

301
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,780
Everybody would say Cuba.

302
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:03,240
Get up there and talk and I
would make fun of the black guys.

303
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:03,931
But what would it be?

304
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:04,764
What would you say?

305
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,120
You know,

306
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,170
we make fun of the kitchen
the first day in prison.

307
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,040
It may be a baker,

308
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:08,581
you know,

309
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:08,881
you don't,

310
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,080
you don't tell people what you want.

311
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:10,860
It's like Cuba.

312
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,311
Like yeah,

313
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:11,881
the outside,

314
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:12,900
I was a mechanic really?

315
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:13,640
Well and here you are,

316
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,750
a baker going to say,

317
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:15,540
here's a book,

318
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,560
learn how to make bagels.

319
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,760
I may be sending them.

320
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:20,070
Rose dog almost blew up the kitchen,

321
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:20,490
right?

322
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,840
These mother fuckers are big.

323
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,370
So that afternoon they fired me,

324
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:27,830
has a baker and they made me a
fucking dishwasher right now,

325
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,190
whenever they had shitty meals,

326
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,070
the guys I knew when they would go
through the line and I would yell,

327
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,203
don't do,

328
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,620
but there's more drugs on the inside.

329
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:37,891
There was,

330
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:38,820
it wasn't any oxide.

331
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:39,631
And to boot.

332
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:41,310
This was a minimum security camp.

333
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,110
We had contact visits.

334
00:09:43,111 --> 00:09:44,310
When you have a contact visit,

335
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,900
there's parties every night.

336
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,040
But that's the first time I did it.

337
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:47,160
No,

338
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,491
I was like,

339
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:48,450
the second time I did it,

340
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:51,000
no one was there and he
couldn't do a needle.

341
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,040
So the Mexican is took a Mexican thing,

342
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,110
a heroin melted it.

343
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,650
I had to put like a funnel in mind.

344
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:59,270
Those made out of paper and they drifted
in my nose and I got mad like candle

345
00:09:59,271 --> 00:09:59,530
wick,

346
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,363
Bro,

347
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,070
what the fuck is this?

348
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:02,371
They're like,

349
00:10:02,371 --> 00:10:03,210
that's heroin man.

350
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,021
Be Cool.

351
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,330
I was like this for like a day.

352
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,530
And then the white dudes,

353
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,640
Michael's gimmie speed and they would
play basketball all fucking night.

354
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,460
I'll be out there of hell's angels

355
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,710
and there'd be out there with them.

356
00:10:17,711 --> 00:10:18,541
Half of them every week.

357
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,374
It was a new adventure.

358
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,200
So on Thursday nights they would say,

359
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:22,621
Cuba,

360
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:23,281
fuck the movie.

361
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:24,720
Just go up there and
talk about the kitchen.

362
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,733
And they were all,

363
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,060
all the yarns would yell,

364
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:28,380
don't do it.

365
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,250
I went in there every Thursday I get
onstage and then one day a guy in the

366
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:35,701
library,

367
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:36,840
it was like a nerdy dude,

368
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,450
the guy that ran the library
and I was friends with him.

369
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:42,510
We did acid and the funny thing was that
one day he came up to me in the jail

370
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,410
and a notebook was a big thing and I was
getting ready to get out and I didn't

371
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:47,161
even thought about it.

372
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:48,210
He came up to me and then he goes,

373
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:48,541
hey bro,

374
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,380
I got you a notebook.

375
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:50,941
And I go,

376
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,740
what's the notebook for
your show when you get out?

377
00:10:52,741 --> 00:10:53,670
You could write some jokes.

378
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,613
He goes,

379
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,160
every week you write jokes.

380
00:10:56,161 --> 00:10:57,030
I never see the notebook.

381
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:57,864
And I looked at him and I go,

382
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,620
I don't even right and this
motherfucker went nuts.

383
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:01,891
He goes,

384
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:04,050
you don't right and you go up
there every week and do that.

385
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:05,461
He goes,

386
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:06,161
when you get out here,

387
00:11:06,161 --> 00:11:06,480
you,

388
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,313
it was like an angel.

389
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,161
It was like an angel.

390
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:09,240
I never seen the guy again.

391
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:10,200
I never heard from again.

392
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,483
He just goes,

393
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,540
what I watch you do?

394
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,600
You really need to write and get it
together because you have a gift.

395
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,560
Just pursue this.

396
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,850
It was in the back of my head.

397
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,610
The prison really woke the animal.

398
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,730
I know so many people look at you.

399
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,080
I know so many people that in one point
in their life were not good people.

400
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:30,270
There were there were fucked
up to run a bad place,

401
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,700
but they turned around and became
some of my favorite people.

402
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,241
You know,

403
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:34,870
you're a perfect example actually.

404
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,700
Absolutely can change rules
and there's confusion.

405
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:39,541
People,

406
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,400
kids don't know what the
fuck they want to do.

407
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,234
I was lost.

408
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,110
I thought that's what I wanted
to do and once I did it,

409
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,000
I seen the reality of it
and never did it again.

410
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,470
And for some people they take the lesson,

411
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,071
they run with it,

412
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:53,560
and for some other people they fucking
keep doing what they were doing because

413
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:54,700
they don't really want to go anywhere.

414
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,530
And I'm really wanting go only way.

415
00:11:56,531 --> 00:11:57,940
Even in my darkest moments,

416
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,710
I always just wanted a little
bit of light so I could shut it.

417
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,170
Just to go forward with the,

418
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,290
I was looking for 50 hours
just to get me started.

419
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:06,491
That's it.

420
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:07,450
To get an apartment,

421
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,040
to get a car tall.

422
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:13,000
I wanted I the Webinar fucked fuckers
up there watching me that I got a break

423
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:13,630
and whatever,

424
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,520
and today I'm not fucking
let them in or whatever,

425
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:16,354
but I'm alive.

426
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,550
When I wake up in the morning,

427
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,490
I'm alive dog.

428
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:21,970
I didn't tell on me alive
at 49 he notify you kid.

429
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,720
I didn't want to be alive at
49 but now I want to be alive,

430
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:26,530
man.

431
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,810
It's beautiful because I crossed over.

432
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:30,550
I don't have that thing
in the back of your mind.

433
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:30,900
Fine.

434
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,380
And that's not take her Marcy.

435
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:33,660
That looks Kinky to me too.

436
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:34,973
I don't think that's fair.

437
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,090
I don't give a fuck.

438
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,390
You're going to go to Mars now.

439
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,700
Now $14 billion with all the shit we
got going on this fucking country.

440
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,301
Mars.

441
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:43,661
For what?

442
00:12:43,661 --> 00:12:44,920
Who gives a fuck about Mars?

443
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,881
I'm sitting there going,

444
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:46,631
listen from gazing.

445
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:47,464
It's fucking tape.

446
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,630
They made this in Burbank.

447
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,070
Every everything that they do,

448
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,720
what's it like to go to the fucking place?

449
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,810
I ex what happened?

450
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,240
We got fucking age,

451
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,230
we've got diseases,

452
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,560
we got fat kids running around March.

453
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,530
A little by little,

454
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,950
we'll fucking dying here dog.

455
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,660
This country's fucking diet.

456
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,793
We got time.

457
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,450
I don't give a fuck what goes on in Mars.

458
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,100
I don't give a fuck what goes on in London
either in 1529 I'm from the Church of

459
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,290
what's happening now and by the bucket,

460
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:13,751
you know,

461
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,840
10 years ago we hung out for years and
you were talking about the moon landing

462
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:17,410
was fake.

463
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,780
Now you're all of a sudden you're
happy about bucking Mars guy.

464
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,793
Come on,

465
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:21,980
give me a fucking break.

466
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,490
What I'm sensing

467
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,720
that goes out every day.

468
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,310
It's waste of thought.

469
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,020
We've got bigger things to fry.

470
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,970
Gas is $5 a tech.

471
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,650
We got this milk robbing guide.

472
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:40,770
Who's a fucking comic con I was fuck from
Idaho or Utah or wherever the fuck is

475
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,850
So Baba Jonathan,

00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:43,930
that's going on good days.

477
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:44,560
His wife,

cause she's making fat.

479
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,630
Kids get fucking skinny.

480
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,500
That's it.

481
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:47,741
I mean,

482
00:13:47,741 --> 00:13:48,460
what the fuck?

483
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,390
What the fuck?

484
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,680
We don't even have a presence.

485
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,061
We don't,

486
00:13:51,061 --> 00:13:53,770
we don't have somebody to vote for the
next four years and we're worried about

487
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:54,431
fucking Mars.

488
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:56,320
Joe Rogan rarely about fucker.

489
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:59,680
What happened in England in 1529 we need
to fucking know what's going to happen

490
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,640
the next three years.

491
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,301
You know what,

492
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:01,810
Doug,

493
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:02,350
you're right.

494
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,830
I'm about to have a baby and I'm fucking
scared because what is he going to have

495
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:06,550
in 40 years?

496
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,180
What are we going to have?

497
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,100
We're going to be getting
