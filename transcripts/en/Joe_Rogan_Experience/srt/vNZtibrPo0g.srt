1
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,210
Boom and we're live.

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:09,021
How are you brother?

3
00:00:09,021 --> 00:00:09,650
What's going on?

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,011
I'm cold.

5
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:10,720
It's good to see you.

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:10,851
Well,

7
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:11,840
this sucker up to you.

8
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,120
Boom.

9
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,180
I'm so good.

10
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,130
I'm very excited about your fight man.

11
00:00:16,131 --> 00:00:16,964
Very excited.

12
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,280
Not as excited as I am.

13
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:19,114
Not to be.

14
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,120
I'm sure.

15
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,420
What,

16
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,270
how often does it that two undefeated,

17
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,360
I mean you're not heavyweight champion
cause they stripped you but you never

18
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:28,700
lost to undefeated heavyweight champions.

19
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:29,481
Go at it like this.

20
00:00:29,481 --> 00:00:30,650
This is a huge fight.

21
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,551
Very much so.

22
00:00:31,551 --> 00:00:33,410
It's never ever happened before ever.

23
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,573
It's pretty exciting.

24
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,990
Someone to as big as us.

25
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:36,580
Um,

26
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,240
I've never ever fought each other.

27
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,180
What do you think of it mean for people
who don't know you're fighting Deontay

28
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:44,230
wilder who's a,

29
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:49,231
an American undefeated knockout artists
and you are probably one of the more

30
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,280
interesting guys in the
heavyweight division.

31
00:00:51,281 --> 00:00:52,870
Not just cause your personality,

32
00:00:52,871 --> 00:00:53,920
but your skill set,

33
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,420
the way you move your long and tall.

34
00:00:56,421 --> 00:00:58,450
But you've got great
footwork and your fast,

35
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:58,931
you know,

36
00:00:58,931 --> 00:00:59,531
it's a very,

37
00:00:59,531 --> 00:01:00,610
very interesting fight.

38
00:01:00,611 --> 00:01:02,530
As far as like boxing technique.

39
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:04,360
It's power,

40
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,700
raw power versus boxing skill.

41
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,171
Two guys.

42
00:01:08,171 --> 00:01:09,070
One six foot nine,

43
00:01:09,071 --> 00:01:10,090
one six foot seven.

44
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,480
Both charismatic,

45
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,540
both talkers,

46
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:14,501
one British,

47
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:15,161
one American.

48
00:01:15,161 --> 00:01:16,540
It doesn't get any
bigger than necessities.

49
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:19,780
The biggest flight that could be made of
this time in heavyweight division or in

50
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:20,614
the world of boxing

51
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,140
when you watched Deontay
wilder move around,

52
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,910
there's nobody that moves like that guy.

53
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:25,900
So odd.

54
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,900
Like it reminds me of Bambi on ice.

55
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,590
He doesn't really find his
legs underneath him now.

56
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,500
Sometimes he throws and he's
got no legs underneath them.

57
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:36,130
These just,

58
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,460
he's swinging and literally he's flying
through the air as he's punching.

59
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,520
I've seen him fall over
a few times as well.

60
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah.

61
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,271
Listen,

62
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:45,360
the guy tries to lung that big punch and
when you're trying to knock people out

63
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:46,470
with every single punch,

64
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,820
then if you miss it becomes a problem
when you go off balance and maybe follow

65
00:01:49,821 --> 00:01:50,550
up.

66
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,383
Yeah.

67
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,201
Will you uh,

68
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:53,640
impressed with him and Louis Ortiz?

69
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:54,474
Fine.

70
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,490
I was impressed with him
because he came back,

71
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,200
he was losing all around.

72
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,340
I only gave wilder the round,

73
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,791
slightly knocked,

74
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:02,740
taught he's down in.

75
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,090
Um,

76
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:04,661
so he done well.

77
00:02:04,661 --> 00:02:05,860
It was his acid test,

78
00:02:05,861 --> 00:02:06,694
so to say,

79
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,150
come through all teases 49 years old.

80
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,550
I'm all beat,

81
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:12,251
at least.

82
00:02:12,251 --> 00:02:15,550
Albie was pasties past his prime age,

83
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:18,820
but still undefeated champion coming in.

84
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,070
So it was a great victory
for Deontae world.

85
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:22,990
And he proved to me
that he can get combat,

86
00:02:22,991 --> 00:02:24,580
get her to come back and win if I

87
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:24,871
yeah.

88
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:26,580
An rts comes from that Cuban system.

89
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:28,170
He's got great skills.

90
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:28,340
I mean,

91
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:28,530
yeah.

92
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,710
And he's looked fantastic and every single
fight other than that fight up until

93
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:32,700
that moment that he got hit.

94
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,381
Yeah.

95
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:33,740
Look,

96
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,330
you can't go swim in
and not get wet or teas.

97
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:37,940
I don't have a 300 amateur fights,

98
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,530
20 odd professional fights,

99
00:02:39,531 --> 00:02:40,341
nearly knocked Tamale Mall.

100
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:41,750
I bought,

101
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,150
if I may be critical of
Louis Ortiz at us minute,

102
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,910
he stood in front of Deontay,

103
00:02:46,911 --> 00:02:48,440
Walder right and punching range,

104
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,250
which is not a wise decision
considering the guys at 39 chaos.

105
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,680
He's movement.

106
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:55,940
He was trying to move a little bit,

107
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:57,380
but he was on old legs.

108
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,610
And I know a story.

109
00:02:58,611 --> 00:02:59,860
What happened before that fight?

110
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,320
Louis Ortiz had very bad blood pressure.

111
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,020
Um,

112
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,790
doctor was gonna pull him out and
he had Charles Martin on standby,

113
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,521
but he said,

114
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:06,761
no,

115
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:07,594
I need the money.

116
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,960
So we went in a fort anyway and
he still nearly beat wilder.

117
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:11,680
Yes.

118
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,790
High blood pressure.

119
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,001
That's interesting.

120
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:16,130
And where and where are
you hearing this from?

121
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,203
Good sources.

122
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,163
Good source.

123
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:18,650
Yeah,

124
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,890
those are the best source is
always the best inside info.

125
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,720
You're an interesting story man,

126
00:03:23,721 --> 00:03:25,730
because not just because your personality,

127
00:03:25,731 --> 00:03:26,750
but because you're,

128
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,050
you've come back from
mental illness and you very,

129
00:03:30,051 --> 00:03:31,070
very open about it.

130
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:31,411
Yeah,

131
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:31,640
no,

132
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,473
I think that's,

133
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,350
that's a very unique thing where I'm,

134
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,420
I remember when you,

135
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:40,570
when you beat Klitschko and won the
title and then you kind of went off the

136
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:43,730
rails and I thought
you were just partying.

137
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:44,451
You know,

138
00:03:44,451 --> 00:03:44,720
when,

139
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,520
when I heard about it I thought wow,

140
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:46,910
God,

141
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,990
I made a shit load of money,

142
00:03:47,991 --> 00:03:49,220
became the heavyweight champion.

143
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:51,380
All the pressure and the
press and all the craziness.

144
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,640
But it was more than that.

145
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:53,980
It was more than that.

146
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,240
It started off like I'll suffered with
mental health problems my whole life,

147
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,470
but I didn't know what it was.

148
00:04:00,471 --> 00:04:02,210
Cause I never had no
education on the mater.

149
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,420
Uh,

150
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,160
money wasn't til after the Klitschko fi
I'm very massive hockey than I ought to

151
00:04:07,161 --> 00:04:07,281
have.

152
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:08,900
A even worse I low,

153
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,880
lowest low that anyone could ever have.

154
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,393
Um,

155
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,270
I'd wake up and I think,

156
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:15,470
why did I wake up this morning?

157
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,680
This is coming from my money.

158
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,331
You want everything,

159
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:17,661
money,

160
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:18,081
fame,

161
00:04:18,081 --> 00:04:18,501
glory,

162
00:04:18,501 --> 00:04:19,334
titles,

163
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,241
our wife,

164
00:04:20,241 --> 00:04:20,841
our family,

165
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:21,201
kids,

166
00:04:21,201 --> 00:04:22,034
everything.

167
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,930
But I felt as if I had nothing.

168
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:28,931
I felt there was an empty gaping hole
that was just filled with gloom and doom.

169
00:04:29,421 --> 00:04:29,901
And I just was,

170
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:31,460
one bad thing happened
to me after another,

171
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,810
within seven days,

172
00:04:32,811 --> 00:04:36,550
the IBF strip me of that title because
I couldn't defend against gloves.

173
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:36,831
Golf.

174
00:04:36,831 --> 00:04:41,831
He was a nobody because allery much closer
volodymyr but the IBF wasn't expected

175
00:04:42,021 --> 00:04:43,400
me to beat Vladimir.

176
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,440
So they took that clause in air anyway,

177
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,950
thinking bloody me is going to announce
to defend against class coffee because I

178
00:04:48,951 --> 00:04:49,784
won.

179
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,570
They,

180
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:51,470
they stripped me of the belt,

181
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,490
which none of my reason

182
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,240
within seven days of the fight.

183
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:54,750
Yeah,

184
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,583
that's insane.

185
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,740
How can they require you to fight

186
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,641
within seven days?

187
00:04:58,641 --> 00:04:59,271
They didn't vote.

188
00:04:59,271 --> 00:05:02,000
They required me to go into negotiations.

189
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,040
So just not going into negotiations to
sign these strip you within seven days.

190
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:06,400
Yeah.

191
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,120
Well they knew I couldn't go into
negotiations because already much close

192
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,510
boxing's a dirty bus.

193
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,730
So I was stuck in between
a rock and a hard place.

194
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,573
Yeah.

195
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,621
And that's what happened.

196
00:05:15,621 --> 00:05:16,401
That was one belt.

197
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:17,190
God,

198
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:22,190
I'll learn my team and the coach coach
team or carrying on about where the

199
00:05:22,581 --> 00:05:23,450
flight was going to be.

200
00:05:23,451 --> 00:05:25,370
It was going to be on
a cruise ship in Dubai.

201
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,541
It was going to be here.

202
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,374
It was going to be there.

203
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,840
Time was dragging on a cruise ship.

204
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,441
A cruise ship.

205
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:30,591
Yeah.

206
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:34,820
There was some Arab billionaire who wanted
to make this fight in exclusive fight

207
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:35,870
for him and his buddies.

208
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:36,580
No.

209
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,413
Yeah,

210
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,390
come on.

211
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,223
Seriously.

212
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,510
This fight was heading for a cruise ship.

213
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,520
That fucking oil money,

214
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:44,180
man,

215
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,430
they got some money and
if they can afford it,

216
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:46,971
do it.

217
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:47,740
That's what I say.

218
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,700
That would have been the most hilarious
scenario ever for a world heavyweight

219
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:55,630
title fight a bunch of Arab
billionaires on a cruise ship.

220
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,773
Wow.

221
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,760
So the strip you of the IBF belt,

222
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,160
you go into negotiation with
Klitschko for the rematch.

223
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,460
How in the rematch never happened.

224
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,051
Very much.

225
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:09,500
Didn't happen initially because I
went over on my uncle in training.

226
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,750
Um,

227
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,470
I was in Holland training folder.

228
00:06:13,471 --> 00:06:14,960
He much on,

229
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:17,870
I was running up on the heavy terrain and
I went over from ankle sprain my ankle

230
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:18,411
quite badly.

231
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,700
So we had to postpone the folly.

232
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:20,840
But,

233
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,550
but that time I was off like say three
months getting his uncle right and all

234
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,393
up.

235
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,390
I just,

236
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,510
I just didn't want to do any,

237
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,373
if you know what I mean.

238
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,510
I didn't have the desire.

239
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:33,530
The fire wasn't burning no longer to
fight and I was suffering with depression

240
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:34,041
the whole time.

241
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:34,910
Even in training camp,

242
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,380
before I sprained my ankle,

243
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,060
I was depressed as depressed,

244
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:39,530
could be on a daily basis.

245
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,360
I don't think,

246
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,330
why am I feeling like this?

247
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,800
I don't have no reason to fail like it.

248
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,270
Some people will say,

249
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,130
oh well each attention
seeking or whatever,

250
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,740
but unless you've
experienced what I'm saying,

251
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,880
it's still of impossible to understand
where it had been aware of come from.

252
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,460
And it just went from bad to worse.

253
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,870
Um,

254
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,450
I hate the drink heavily on a daily basis.

255
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:00,470
I hit the drugs.

256
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,850
Um,

257
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:06,410
I was out all night party team of
women of the night and not coming home.

258
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:07,244
And you know,

259
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,600
I didn't care about boxing.

260
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:09,620
I didn't care about living it,

261
00:07:09,621 --> 00:07:12,500
just wanting to die and I was going to
have a good time doing it while I was

262
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:13,334
doing it.

263
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,390
I used to drink and take drugs to get
away from their depression because when I

264
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,410
was drunk or high,

265
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,581
then I wouldn't,

266
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:19,831
uh,

267
00:07:19,831 --> 00:07:23,770
I wouldn't think about being depressed
for fall about being a boxing champion or

268
00:07:23,771 --> 00:07:23,880
I'm,

269
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,770
I feel great.

270
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,590
But as we know when the drink was off,

271
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,820
he only leaves you with a bad hangover
and failing even more depressed.

272
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,890
But someone who suffers
with mental health,

273
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:36,770
the worst thing we can do to
escape it is take drugs or alcohol.

274
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:37,941
But yeah,

275
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:39,080
that's the most common approach.

276
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,220
And that's the common approach because
people we don't know cause it's not spoke

277
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:43,970
about.

278
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:48,110
And this is why I want to spread
the word on mental health.

279
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:51,290
So when other people are in
this position in the future,

280
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,410
they know where to go and they know
what to do because there's a blueprint.

281
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:55,551
Well,

282
00:07:55,551 --> 00:08:00,551
Kudos to you for doing that because so
so few people have the courage to talk

283
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:03,470
about their struggles when they go
through that because it seems like a

284
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:04,160
weakness.

285
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,560
Yeah.

286
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:04,850
You know,

287
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,061
it's,

288
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:09,080
it's very powerful that you were willing
to do that and just be open and honest

289
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:09,470
about it.

290
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,630
There's a few people out
there that are doing that now.

291
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:11,991
You know,

292
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,340
our friend moral Rinaldo,

293
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,600
he's gone through some some serious
mental health issues and he's very open

294
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:20,030
about it and talks about
it quite a bit now.

295
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,890
When you were training for the first
Klitschko fight for the fight rather,

296
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,450
did you have it then?

297
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,311
Not really,

298
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:28,750
no.

299
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:33,750
I was set focused on what I wanted to
do and that was beat Vladimir Klitschko.

300
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:39,490
I believe when you've got a goal in mind
or from being a child all your life and

301
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:40,820
you do that,

302
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,100
then I was like obviously lost.

303
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,220
I was almost like I didn't have
anything more to do in my life,

304
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,680
although I could a carried on on,

305
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,471
defended the belt,

306
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:49,304
some whatever.

307
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,950
I wasn't really interested in
doing that I'd beat them on.

308
00:08:51,951 --> 00:08:54,770
I'd always wanted to do because
when I was an amateur boxer,

309
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,710
I used to watch flood in mayor Klitschko
on TV as a world heavyweight champion.

310
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,720
And I always aimed,

311
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:02,580
he was my target to beat.

312
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:03,870
I want to finally beat him.

313
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:07,050
It was like climbing Mount Everest and
didn't have anything more to prove.

314
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,060
And the fire was debt.

315
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,901
There was no fire.

316
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:14,100
I was forcing myself to fight and I always
said I didn't want to be one of those

317
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:18,150
people who just fought for money because
there's plenty of people were money in

318
00:09:18,151 --> 00:09:18,720
the world,

319
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,553
plenty of them.

320
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,663
But who knows him?

321
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:21,811
Um,

322
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,950
the reasons for me fight in,

323
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:24,180
it's not for money or,

324
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,620
or for belts or glory,

325
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,400
a fight because I don't
know anything else.

326
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,880
I've always been a fighter from
being born to being 30 years old.

327
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:34,560
Now it's all I love to do.

328
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:35,700
I don't have any of a passion.

329
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,103
I've locked.

330
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,060
The Lord knows I've locked and if I had
anything else that was going to our I

331
00:09:40,061 --> 00:09:40,650
could do,

332
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,483
I'd be doing it.

333
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:42,661
I just,

334
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:43,650
I tried retirement.

335
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:48,770
I was 27 I retired on in the second man
in boxing heavyweight history to retire

336
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:51,510
on beaten as a world champion
like rocky Malsiano before me,

337
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,100
but it wasn't enough.

338
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,360
I was like,

339
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,160
I am lost without this fight game.

340
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,510
I tried golfing,

341
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,430
I tried clay pigeon shooting.

342
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,200
I tried four by four in,

343
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,060
I tried going to strip clubs,

344
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:03,631
bars,

345
00:10:03,631 --> 00:10:04,140
restaurants,

346
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:04,973
everything,

347
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,000
and it was just like I had this emptiness
inside where I just want it to fight.

348
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,171
Well,

349
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:11,820
in comparison to what you've accomplished,

350
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,190
everything else has to seem pretty dull.

351
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:14,821
I mean,

352
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:17,970
until you step into the ring
with Vladimir Klitschko,

353
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,850
who was widely considered to be one
of the greatest heavyweights ever,

354
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:22,590
and you box his face off.

355
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,420
I mean that was a beautiful performance.

356
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,820
It walls shut him down.

357
00:10:26,821 --> 00:10:27,654
It was weird.

358
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,620
It was weird to watch them.

359
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:30,420
It's like there was moments
in that fight where he just,

360
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,370
he just looked like he didn't
know what to do with you.

361
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,300
I'm going to see you again on December.

362
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,134
The first,

363
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:36,461
like I said,

364
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:37,330
to flood has had to,

365
00:10:37,331 --> 00:10:38,980
same thing to Deontay wilder.

366
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,200
You fought the Americans,

367
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:42,300
you fought the Mexican,

368
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:43,810
you fought a Europeans.

369
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:44,351
Paul,

370
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,420
you ain't never fought
the gypsy king before.

371
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,070
I said it straight Tivola in me.

372
00:10:48,071 --> 00:10:48,311
I said,

373
00:10:48,311 --> 00:10:49,180
you look in our king.

374
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:49,621
I said,

375
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:49,691
eve,

376
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:50,710
you've ever for king before?

377
00:10:50,711 --> 00:10:50,921
He said,

378
00:10:50,921 --> 00:10:51,550
no.

379
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:51,761
I said,

380
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:52,720
we fight him on now.

381
00:10:52,721 --> 00:10:53,051
And he said,

382
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:53,950
you're going to lose to one.

383
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,041
Well,

384
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,180
he's lost before,

385
00:10:56,181 --> 00:10:59,120
but he's lost because he got
clipped and hurt and stopped.

386
00:10:59,121 --> 00:11:02,600
And I was very impressed with him actually
in the Anthony Joshua fight because

387
00:11:02,601 --> 00:11:05,630
he came back from getting badly
hurt and almost put Joshua away.

388
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,560
But the fight with you is different
because you just outboxed him.

389
00:11:09,561 --> 00:11:12,290
And he was known as the
guy who would box and hold,

390
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:12,891
Jab,

391
00:11:12,891 --> 00:11:13,580
and hold.

392
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:13,881
I mean,

393
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,460
he was one of the most boring
heavyweights of all time.

394
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,650
Fantastically successful.

395
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,990
But from a spectator point of view,

396
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,450
you watched some of his
fights and like Jesus Christ,

397
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,590
he would jab you,

398
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:25,424
grab you,

399
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,480
Jab and grab you.

400
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:26,661
I mean,

401
00:11:26,661 --> 00:11:27,441
that was his thing.

402
00:11:27,441 --> 00:11:28,520
Right hand grabbed you.

403
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,580
It worked here.

404
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,860
25 title defenses.

405
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,750
I mean it was very successful,

406
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,060
but that shit didn't work with you.

407
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,260
It didn't for the first time in his
whole career he was fighting somebody who

408
00:11:39,261 --> 00:11:40,490
was not just bigger than him,

409
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,530
but more off LATIC who could move more.

410
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,240
Yeah,

411
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,740
so money wasn't just
looking for one lucky punch.

412
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,530
I knew going into the fight
in me a flight that everybody,

413
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:51,170
all the rest of the opponents
and 25 men before me,

414
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,350
I'd all went in trying
to do the same thing,

415
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,490
try to knock him out and he's got,

416
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,650
he's got so men of a,

417
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,440
a weird defense where he puts both arms
out in front of him and it's almost very

418
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:03,710
awkward to London,

419
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,580
not chain where big punches so far.

420
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:07,450
I'm not going to do that.

421
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,440
Not gonna make that mistake.

422
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:12,430
I'm going to outbox him on all me
teams that there's not a good idea.

423
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,380
We've got to go to Germany to try now.

424
00:12:14,381 --> 00:12:16,450
Box a super champion and
try and win on the cards.

425
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,283
Are you crazy?

426
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:17,801
I said,

427
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:18,634
yes.

428
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:18,941
I said,

429
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:19,870
but if I wasn't crazy,

430
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:20,710
I won't be great.

431
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,550
And I went over there and
outboxed him and nobody,

432
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,480
nobody apart from my
brother or me father fought,

433
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,343
I could do it.

434
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:30,700
You know,

435
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,440
even people who were close to me and camp,

436
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:33,274
they were like,

437
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,650
they were very unsure of
what was gonna happen.

438
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,500
I may be me.

439
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:40,840
I always had a little smile on
my face because I believed it.

440
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,200
I believed I could always beat flooding.

441
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:43,811
Miracle it go.

442
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:46,090
I even told Vladimir years before,

443
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:47,650
when I was 22 I said,

444
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:51,190
I will beat you one day in
manual steward told him to God,

445
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:52,024
rest his soul.

446
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:52,781
He said,

447
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:54,640
Tyson fury is the heir to the throne.

448
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:56,651
He said,

449
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,830
and when his time is ready
will be you straight to him.

450
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,551
Pardon me?

451
00:13:00,551 --> 00:13:03,890
I hated that he hated him and
y'all talking about me like that.

452
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,091
We don't have evil.

453
00:13:05,091 --> 00:13:05,924
Why?

454
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:06,421
Well,

455
00:13:06,421 --> 00:13:06,741
let me sure.

456
00:13:06,741 --> 00:13:09,080
It was good fire under him
during training as well.

457
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,270
Now you,

458
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,190
you were focused for that fight.

459
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:13,910
You were,

460
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:17,690
you were prepared and afterwards,

461
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:22,160
was it just the realization that you
would accomplish this incredible goal?

462
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:23,540
It's set into depression.

463
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,760
Was it you didn't know what to do next
or was it just that your focus was now no

464
00:13:28,761 --> 00:13:30,650
longer on this unattainable,

465
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,161
you know,

466
00:13:31,161 --> 00:13:34,910
like almost insurmountable obstacle in
front of you becoming the heavyweight

467
00:13:34,911 --> 00:13:35,744
champion of the world.

468
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:36,860
All of a sudden you did it.

469
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,750
Then the depression kicks in.

470
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:39,960
Yeah,

471
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,810
my conditioning train a Christian,

472
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,450
he said to me before the Klitschko Fai,

473
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,303
he said,

474
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,580
what will you do after you win?

475
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,080
I said,

476
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,910
probably be depressed for a long time.

477
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:51,531
He said,

478
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:52,364
why?

479
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:52,821
I said,

480
00:13:52,821 --> 00:13:53,654
truthfully,

481
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,380
I was almost expecting it and I
didn't think I'd have a box again.

482
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,630
Even the day after the Klitschko fight,

483
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,530
sky's boss interviewed me that the UK
broad customer put it on and they said,

484
00:14:03,531 --> 00:14:04,760
what's next for Tyson theory?

485
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:05,594
I said,

486
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,890
I'll probably never box again.

487
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,893
I knew.

488
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,531
I said to me,

489
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:11,060
dad and my brothers before the fight,

490
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,530
a week before the fight,

491
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:12,801
I said,

492
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:12,981
win,

493
00:14:12,981 --> 00:14:13,880
lose or draw.

494
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:14,571
I said,

495
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:17,990
this is probably going to be my last
fight cause I knew the fire was going.

496
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:19,370
I didn't have that hunger anymore.

497
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,480
Had the hunger to beat Vladimir Klitschko
bought not to carry on and continue.

498
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,350
And I said I didn't want it to
be about money or financial gain.

499
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,660
I want it to be the best of my time,

500
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:30,560
beat the best month.

501
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:31,820
And that's what I did.

502
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,050
And I was a me where worded,

503
00:14:33,051 --> 00:14:35,780
I didn't box again until

504
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,750
two and a half year later I decided to
make a comeback because I was sitting

505
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:43,380
here 400 pounds,

506
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,280
drug addict and Alcoholic,

507
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:46,930
by the way,

508
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:51,930
had never took a drug in my life until
I got to 27 really never smoked weed.

509
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:52,721
Not,

510
00:14:52,721 --> 00:14:53,554
not morphing.

511
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,310
And what drove with drugs?

512
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,920
What were the drugs of choice
once you won the title?

513
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,740
Cocaine was the usual one and that was it.

514
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:01,460
Really.

515
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,690
Cocaine and alcohol.

516
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,790
It's like rollercoaster,

517
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,670
crazy drug,

518
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,503
drug and alcohol.

519
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,413
But you know,

520
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:13,760
I look back on it now and I think
what I changed that I wouldn't,

521
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,380
I'm not many people will think,

522
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,570
well this man's crazy for
saying that on a radio show.

523
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:22,220
But I wouldn't change a thing because
I know it was supposed to happen and I

524
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,250
needed to be tested to see
what type of character of us.

525
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,660
Although I did all those mud things and
I went for wall that time and I tried to

526
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:31,550
commit suicide and I,

527
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,840
how'd you try to commit suicide?

528
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:33,081
Well,

529
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:34,010
I'll tell you what happened.

530
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,283
I,

531
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,771
like I said,

532
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:37,431
I was waking up on,

533
00:15:37,431 --> 00:15:38,181
I didn't want to be alive.

534
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:39,770
I was making everybody's life a misery.

535
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:41,690
Everybody was close to
me and was pushing away.

536
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,460
Nobody could talk to me,

537
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:45,020
talk any sense into me at all.

538
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,443
And

539
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,401
I'd go very,

540
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:49,671
very,

541
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:54,671
very low at times a very low and I start
thinking all these crazy thoughts and

542
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:55,844
this start near the,

543
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,110
and I was in me car.

544
00:15:57,111 --> 00:15:57,680
I bought a,

545
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,680
bought a brand new Ferrari convertible
in the summer of 2016 and I was in the,

546
00:16:04,691 --> 00:16:06,440
Alan was on the highway on this,

547
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:07,940
a strip of highway where I am,

548
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,790
I'm at the bottom of
about a five mile strip.

549
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,710
There's a massive bridged across as a
motorway and I knew that and I got the car

550
00:16:15,711 --> 00:16:17,300
up to 190 miles an hour.

551
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,720
I was heading towards up
bridge and I didn't care or no,

552
00:16:20,721 --> 00:16:21,350
almost sinking.

553
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,071
I didn't care about her,

554
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:22,904
to me family,

555
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,620
me,

556
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,380
my career,

557
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,310
people who friends,

558
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:25,791
anybody.

559
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:26,624
I didn't care.

560
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,610
I didn't care about nothing.

561
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,060
I just want to die so bad.

562
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,960
I give up on life and just as it was
getting towards upper edge or one 19 and

563
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:34,794
his Ferrari,

564
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,070
it a crushed like a coke come
by the way I've heard of it.

565
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,790
I heard a voice say,

566
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,624
no,

567
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:42,651
don't do this.

568
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:43,250
Tyson,

569
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,450
think about your kids.

570
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,710
Think about your family and you'll all
boys and girls growing up with no father

571
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,470
and everyone saying
your dad was a week mum.

572
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,510
He left his,

573
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,240
he took the easy way out because
he couldn't do anything about it

574
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,240
before are turned into the bridge.

575
00:16:59,260 --> 00:16:59,790
I,

576
00:16:59,790 --> 00:16:59,900
uh,

577
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,490
pulled on the motor and I was shaking.

578
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,030
I could feel myself shaking and I pulled
over and I was all nervous and didn't

579
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:05,431
know what to do.

580
00:17:05,431 --> 00:17:07,280
And I was frightened and I was so afraid

581
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,130
and a fall that day,

582
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:10,731
I'll never,

583
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:11,031
ever,

584
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,790
ever try or think about
taking me on life ever again.

585
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,973
And I didn't.

586
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,950
I went and got help from
a delete in psychiatrist,

587
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:19,490
um,

588
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:22,160
doctor in the UK and my
dad were not with me.

589
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:23,360
And she said to me that she said,

590
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,900
can I have a word alone with you,

591
00:17:24,901 --> 00:17:25,734
John?

592
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:26,400
He said,

593
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,233
Yah.

594
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,300
I mean,

595
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,930
I've told me what she
said when he came out.

596
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,651
She said,

597
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:30,831
hey,

598
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:32,150
it's not to be trusted alone.

599
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,280
He's an imminent death risk.

600
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:38,690
That's the highest level of suicide
risk that she'd ever assessed it.

601
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,333
And she said,

602
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,930
without his faith,

603
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,540
he would have been dead a long time ago.

604
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,261
But she said,

605
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:47,570
faith alone ain't gonna hold
him cause that's going to break.

606
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,340
I'm on site goes,

607
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,413
he's done.

608
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:56,760
So I'll pop my dad's life terror as well
because he was checking up on me all

609
00:17:56,761 --> 00:17:57,151
the time.

610
00:17:57,151 --> 00:18:02,100
He wanted to be with me 24 seven he was
even asleep and in my house with me,

611
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,900
married man before kids,

612
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,790
I was in a right state.

613
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,463
I'll just,

614
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:08,880
I just,

615
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,620
I want it.

616
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,380
I just didn't want to live anymore and
I had everything that man could want.

617
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,970
There wasn't nothing I didn't have,

618
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,141
but it meant nothing.

619
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:16,651
Nothing meant.

620
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:19,020
And even I thought worthless on.

621
00:18:19,021 --> 00:18:19,854
The longer it went on,

622
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,180
the more it,

623
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,550
it hurt inside in the
Moros ERT and everybody,

624
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,230
everybody give up on me.

625
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,850
And before farm we fall,

626
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:29,250
I was definitely gonna die and
I was going to kill myself.

627
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,470
And after that I tried.

628
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,251
I was thinking to myself,

629
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:32,580
you know what?

630
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,271
I need to get better.

631
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:33,600
I need to,

632
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,590
I need to do something.

633
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,480
But every time I tried to go to the gym,

634
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:37,350
I don't know if voice say,

635
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:38,120
Nah,

636
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,480
this ain't for orals anymore.

637
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,380
I'm not going to do this.

638
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,151
I didn't want to do it.

639
00:18:41,151 --> 00:18:41,940
I'd run.

640
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,680
I'd run 200 yards and pull up.

641
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:44,910
I wouldn't even get a mile.

642
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:45,091
I think.

643
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:45,540
Ugh.

644
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,111
Can't be bothered.

645
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:46,944
I don't want to do this.

646
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,120
Boxing is not for me.

647
00:18:48,121 --> 00:18:53,121
I hated boxing at one stage in 2016 early
17 I wouldn't have done a boxing fight

648
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,700
for this room full of diamonds.

649
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:57,983
No Way.

650
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,920
I hated box in,

651
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:00,120
I won't watch on the TV.

652
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,440
I won't read about it.

653
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,760
I hated boxing.

654
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,760
I've done it my whole life and I
didn't want no part of it anymore.

655
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,160
Um,

656
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,090
I was out drinking.

657
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,550
I didn't gag,

658
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,020
give up taking drugs like I said.

659
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,720
And it comes to a point or
was doing that for 18 months.

660
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:16,643
My life.

661
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,340
And I was out 2017 Halloween.

662
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,650
I was a 400 lbs,

663
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,940
dressed up as a skeleton and I go
to this fancy dress party in it.

664
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,110
I'm looking around and I'm thinking,

665
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,030
these are all young kids compared to me.

666
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,540
I'm 30 and I feel like I was the
oldest guy in there like 29 I was like,

667
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,890
what am I doing here?

668
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,450
Is this what you want for your life?

669
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,190
And I thought to myself,

670
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,410
this is not me a number.

671
00:19:40,411 --> 00:19:42,360
How many people told me before this

672
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,940
while I was going wrong,

673
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:46,410
what was due and you
need to act to your life.

674
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,480
You can only change your life
if you want to change it.

675
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,500
And I left and everyone said,

676
00:19:50,501 --> 00:19:50,790
are you going?

677
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:50,941
Oh,

678
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:51,840
early said,

679
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:52,350
yeah.

680
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,280
I left at nine o'clock.

681
00:19:53,281 --> 00:19:55,170
I went home and I got back home.

682
00:19:55,171 --> 00:19:56,180
I didn't say anything to the line,

683
00:19:56,181 --> 00:19:58,140
but it went straight
upstairs into a dark room

684
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,120
and I took burst.

685
00:20:01,121 --> 00:20:01,980
Chief had skeleton,

686
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:02,814
so tough.

687
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:07,800
I know I was up there and I got on my
knees and I was praying and begging God to

688
00:20:07,801 --> 00:20:08,634
help me.

689
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,300
I don't know,

690
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,520
at this point I'd never,

691
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,690
I've never begged or cried
to God to help maybe for her,

692
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,600
prayed a lot,

693
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,673
all my life,

694
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,230
but I'd never been in this
physical state before.

695
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,720
I could feel tears running down my face.

696
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,400
My chest was wet with tears because
I knew I couldn't do it on my own.

697
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:32,040
It wasn't possible for me because I tried
and tried and tried and ended up back

698
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:32,740
in Nepal,

699
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,573
back drinking.

700
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,680
I almost accepted that that was
going to be my fate and alcoholic.

701
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,800
So I was on my knees in his bedroom.

702
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,283
Um,

703
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,250
after praying for about 10 minutes,

704
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,760
I got up and I felt the weight of the
world was lifted off my shoulders and for

705
00:20:51,371 --> 00:20:55,450
the first time in years I knew
it was going to make a comeback.

706
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,501
And I called,

707
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:57,390
my wife has said Paris,

708
00:20:57,391 --> 00:20:57,680
Paris,

709
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,390
she a ball.

710
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,010
She was drunk coming home from the pope.

711
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:01,960
I said,

712
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,530
Monday morning I start to regain
mission to try and get the heavyweight

713
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:06,550
championship of the world buck.

714
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,511
She said,

715
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:07,691
yeah,

716
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:07,871
yeah,

717
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:08,380
yeah.

718
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,520
Because before this,

719
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,230
every time I'd have a beer,

720
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,750
I'd come back and I'm going to be the
heavyweight champion of the world again.

721
00:21:13,751 --> 00:21:14,290
Cause it was,

722
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,490
it was the alcohol talking.

723
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,800
So I was like the man who called
Wolf a thousand times on this,

724
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,970
this jeep had Korea that I,

725
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,820
that I was living on the past thinking
about years before glory days.

726
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,860
And after this prior I got up,

727
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:30,090
I said,

728
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:30,400
boy,

729
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:30,971
this is going to be,

730
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:32,320
she didn't believe me one second.

731
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,090
But even when I speak to her now,

732
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:34,541
she says,

733
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:35,021
not night.

734
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:35,621
You told me that.

735
00:21:35,621 --> 00:21:35,921
She said,

736
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:40,921
I earn a difference in your voice
swimming up and next day I phoned up Ben

737
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,870
Davison and I said,

738
00:21:43,871 --> 00:21:46,540
I don't want to go back downhill
route but as same trainer,

739
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,850
same promote to say many
things and everything's got
to change as it's is going

740
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:51,040
to be a new Tyson fury.

741
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:53,711
And we called it,

742
00:21:53,711 --> 00:21:54,910
returned to the mock mission.

743
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,860
And as I went out that morning off the
phone in Bannon or arranging everything

744
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:00,700
and went out for a run,

745
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,490
it may sweat soaked out IOD
ambitions of running two miles.

746
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,480
I got about five minutes into the Roman,

747
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,850
stopped on a walked

748
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,430
and while I was walking,

749
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:17,200
I can't run them too up to 400
pounds before I'm going to walk,

750
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:18,220
I'm going to get out and walk.

751
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,511
While I was walking,

752
00:22:19,511 --> 00:22:23,920
I was flicking through my phone on
Instagram and I sees this video of

753
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:24,401
[inaudible] tape,

754
00:22:24,401 --> 00:22:26,290
wilder say in,

755
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:26,770
Yep.

756
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,130
Tyson theories finally done that because
the week before I'd been a boxing show

757
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:32,620
in Manchester or something
and the press took a picture.

758
00:22:32,621 --> 00:22:32,831
I mean,

759
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:33,670
it was like everywhere.

760
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:35,410
This big fat out of shape,

761
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:39,200
ugly ball that it bearded
white as a sheet man.

762
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:43,900
I was like a state and a this video.

763
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,180
Yet after seeing this
evidence at Tyson fury,

764
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:48,010
I finally know he's finished.

765
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,440
It can never come back.

766
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,700
And if he,

767
00:22:51,701 --> 00:22:53,500
even if our water fought
him and he's aid aid,

768
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,393
I'd have knocked him out.

769
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,950
And before that he was
talking about Mike Tyson.

770
00:22:57,951 --> 00:22:59,020
Now we'd not Mike Tyson.

771
00:22:59,021 --> 00:23:00,880
I went around and I thought myself,

772
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:05,200
that was very disrespectful to talk about
someone who's not even from your era

773
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,210
and one and divide them
and all that sort of stuff.

774
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:07,620
What?

775
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,650
There's no possible chance.

776
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,750
So photos have,

777
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,571
you know what I've ever do,

778
00:23:10,571 --> 00:23:10,941
fight you.

779
00:23:10,941 --> 00:23:12,130
I'm going to give it you for that reason.

780
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,550
And then when I saw this over video of
him saying things about me and that I

781
00:23:15,551 --> 00:23:16,384
couldn't come back,

782
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:21,700
he gave me that much more motivation
to return just so I can beat Deontay

783
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:22,534
wilder.

784
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:26,200
So I'd always caught cases on as well.

785
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,290
I was being charged where we've
taken performance and unseen drugs.

786
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,510
Nandrolone something I'd never done.

787
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:31,930
I had,

788
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,180
I had an nandrolone enemies system.

789
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,050
It's produced naturally,

790
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,913
nobody,

791
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,730
but they say my levels were elevated.

792
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,360
Dka,

793
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,690
UK Anti doping said there
was no case to answer,

794
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:46,500
but all of a sudden I had a big water
case on me that took three years to salt

795
00:23:47,181 --> 00:23:50,070
out and buy on every one side.

796
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,440
Y'All getting in Hotmail,

797
00:23:51,441 --> 00:23:52,274
Donnie Hassan,

798
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:54,440
you get a 12 year bomb and I said,

799
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:54,861
you know what?

800
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:56,510
Well you've 12 years,

801
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,010
not just for an Angelo.

802
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,930
I'm refused on as well.

803
00:23:59,931 --> 00:24:03,080
I was in a bad mood one day and the
drug test and people come in the gym and

804
00:24:03,081 --> 00:24:04,220
I've told them to fuck off.

805
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,560
This is when you were
training for your comeback?

806
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,880
This was when I was out with training.

807
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:08,120
Yeah.

808
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:13,070
When I was just all the time I was fat
and out of shape and not train and I was

809
00:24:13,071 --> 00:24:15,680
still being run them
drug tested by UK Aad.

810
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,190
Really?

811
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,350
That's why I tested
positive twice for cocaine

812
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,360
and everyone said no,

813
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,600
he never getting back the,

814
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,860
the boxing board of control spending
my license in the UK for the cocaine,

815
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:27,130
um,

816
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:27,963
use.

817
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,330
So I had a court case looking
at been far band forever,

818
00:24:31,331 --> 00:24:33,640
basically suspension.

819
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,450
The doctor made me
medically unfit to fight,

820
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,330
so that was after I forgot about that bit.

821
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,390
When I was rescheduling
the Klitschko to fight,

822
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,090
the psychiatrist phoned up and he says,

823
00:24:46,091 --> 00:24:46,450
look,

824
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,520
he is medically unfit.

825
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,640
He can't fight anybody,

826
00:24:48,641 --> 00:24:49,210
don't want to live,

827
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,043
nevermind fight.

828
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,040
So I was medically deemed unfit to box,

829
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:56,530
suspended by the boxing board of
Control for the cocaine use on out an

830
00:24:56,531 --> 00:24:57,610
underlying case on me.

831
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,130
I'm a refusal case and by the way,

832
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,530
it was racking up millions of
dollars in lawyers' face too.

833
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,680
But I was so confident
that I was going to,

834
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:10,130
everything was going to be okay
because when I was down on my knees,

835
00:25:10,131 --> 00:25:12,920
I just knew that it was going to
be okay and everyone was like,

836
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,100
what's the point in training and doing
anything with you when you're not,

837
00:25:16,101 --> 00:25:16,761
you can't do anything.

838
00:25:16,761 --> 00:25:17,810
You're not in a position to do it.

839
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:18,441
I said,

840
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:19,610
everything's going to be all right.

841
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,473
Don't worry.

842
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,640
Court case comes along in December,

843
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,283
we'll go.

844
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:24,741
They say,

845
00:25:24,741 --> 00:25:24,981
right,

846
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:27,350
this court case has dragged
on insufficient evidence.

847
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,453
Get rid of it.

848
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,490
We both agreed that we was going
to call it quits on the case.

849
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,331
I like on my way.

850
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:32,720
They got,

851
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,460
as they pay their legal fees,

852
00:25:34,461 --> 00:25:35,810
I pay my legal fees.

853
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,800
Tom,

854
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,270
that was a drugs case out the window.

855
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:39,104
Finished

856
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,330
the suspension.

857
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,780
I got to meet him with a border
control in the UK and they said,

858
00:25:44,781 --> 00:25:45,430
look,

859
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:49,790
if if you can get past medically
fit by doctor mentally,

860
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,070
then we'll reassess your case.

861
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,210
I'm telling and denied.

862
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,553
So I said right,

863
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,513
no problem.

864
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,051
Phone doctor,

865
00:25:56,051 --> 00:25:57,730
the psychiatrist or
seeing people who would,

866
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,840
who had spoke to all these doctors,

867
00:25:59,841 --> 00:26:00,860
three or four different doctor,

868
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:01,221
Phil's,

869
00:26:01,221 --> 00:26:02,120
Dr. Jones,

870
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,520
whoever else said or I need to,

871
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,420
I need reassessing.

872
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:10,760
Reyes has me bang pass with flying colors
and went back to the border control

873
00:26:10,761 --> 00:26:13,340
handed in my certificate by
all these different doctors,

874
00:26:13,341 --> 00:26:14,121
examinations,

875
00:26:14,121 --> 00:26:15,350
physical and mental.

876
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:18,290
They said we have no other choice
but to give you a license reinstated,

877
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,183
Bang.

878
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,280
So it was three of the biggest
obstacles in my life at once.

879
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,890
We're all done within a
month or two straight away.

880
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:29,060
Then I just had the easy
task of lose in 160 pounds,

881
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,120
whichever kind of got overall,

882
00:26:32,121 --> 00:26:32,751
I'm other things.

883
00:26:32,751 --> 00:26:35,300
Losing weight as a fighter was
something that I'd done that tron.

884
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:36,134
Anyway,

885
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:41,380
so then me and Ben sat about losing
this 160 pounds along the way back home.

886
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,560
Spoke to Frank Warren.

887
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:43,560
He became a promoter.

888
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,910
I'm frank said,

889
00:26:44,911 --> 00:26:45,270
right,

890
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,470
you've on a long time out the ring.

891
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:47,490
You've abused your body.

892
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,680
Let's get your four or five comeback
flights just so you're ready.

893
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:53,641
I said,

894
00:26:53,641 --> 00:26:53,941
okay,

895
00:26:53,941 --> 00:26:54,774
no problem.

896
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,990
Healthy might fight.

897
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,030
How'd the other combat fight?

898
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,230
I said to frank,

899
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,520
I don't need any more combat fights.

900
00:26:59,521 --> 00:27:00,710
Make the wilder flight now.

901
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,220
No,

902
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:02,360
no,

903
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:02,521
no,

904
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:02,611
no,

905
00:27:02,611 --> 00:27:02,791
no.

906
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:03,091
He said,

907
00:27:03,091 --> 00:27:04,800
let's have a couple more just in case.

908
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:05,401
I said,

909
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:06,234
I'm telling you,

910
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,470
make the wild a fight.

911
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,390
So this is where people don't understand.

912
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:10,950
I've picked Deontay wilder.

913
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,060
He didn't pick me.

914
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,343
I picked him.

915
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:14,161
Well,

916
00:27:14,161 --> 00:27:16,050
he needs a high profile
opponent right now,

917
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,430
but does it looks like,

918
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:18,690
I mean,

919
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,730
I don't want to say that
Joshua was ducking him,

920
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,710
but it looked like he had to say that.

921
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,573
Yeah,

922
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,780
there's something going on.

923
00:27:24,781 --> 00:27:25,930
He Wa who,

924
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:29,040
whether it's as his
management or his promoter,

925
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,010
they didn't seem to want
that fight right away.

926
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,460
I know some quite close details on that.

927
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,530
Todd is the detail details is um,

928
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,530
wildest team offered Joshua's team,

929
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,650
$80 million for a two flight deal,

930
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,230
$50 million for the first fight.

931
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,360
And I'm 30 million for the rematch.

932
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:53,390
If Joshua lost and they declined
up and my lawyer Robert Davis,

933
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,320
he saw a proof of funds from my layman.

934
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:57,570
So Eddie earn and he's,

935
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:00,480
each chunk buddies can all
say this suddenly of a pull.

936
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:03,180
I know the truth cause
proof of funds we're seeing.

937
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:07,740
So you think it's because
of when Klitschko knocked
him down and had him hurt,

938
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,500
they were worried about
Deontae with his big power.

939
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,200
I don't think it's about eva fighter.

940
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,340
It's bigger than that.

941
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,180
It's about money,

942
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,640
about keeping the money role,

943
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,040
keeping the golden goose lane,

944
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:18,421
their mags,

945
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:19,230
looking after it.

946
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:24,060
Don't take any risks with Joshua was
Olympic gold medalist and in the UK it's a

947
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:24,720
massive story.

948
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,650
Sells out stadiums,

949
00:28:25,651 --> 00:28:26,431
70,000,

950
00:28:26,431 --> 00:28:27,420
90,000.

951
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,290
Huge Star.

952
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,123
Huge data.

953
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,533
Um,

954
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:34,920
so why would you want to get him beat
by somebody who nobody's really heard of

955
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,240
or even take a risk of it?

956
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,940
They took the risk in Nicolette JCO fight.

957
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,090
It almost didn't pay off.

958
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,100
They scrape through skin of the teeth,

959
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,761
put heat on it,

960
00:28:44,761 --> 00:28:45,241
fair play.

961
00:28:45,241 --> 00:28:46,200
He got up off the canvas,

962
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:50,770
showed a champion's heart to come back
and knock out Klitschko fairplay ball.

963
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:51,763
Since then,

964
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,140
they haven't remotely
stepped off a tall default.

965
00:28:55,141 --> 00:28:56,040
Joseph Parker,

966
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,930
and he did knock Josee Park,

967
00:28:57,931 --> 00:28:58,061
right?

968
00:28:58,061 --> 00:28:59,370
It didn't even hurt Josie Parker,

969
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,870
he fought Carlos Tucker
had a hard fight with him,

970
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:04,780
had a hard fight,

971
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,610
hard fight.

972
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,710
So that just keeping up money,

973
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,573
train going.

974
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:11,340
And I don't blame him because this
is a business at the end of the day.

975
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,380
And if I was his management team,

976
00:29:13,381 --> 00:29:14,700
I'd say stay away from fury.

977
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:17,850
Stay away from wilder and we'll just
fight the rest of the people and keep

978
00:29:17,851 --> 00:29:19,380
making plenty of money.

979
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,120
Why do we need to fight these guys who
are very risky for that may be a little

980
00:29:24,121 --> 00:29:25,410
bit more than we're getting now.

981
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,390
Two Times more,

982
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:26,970
right?

983
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:27,691
But in the long run,

984
00:29:27,691 --> 00:29:31,020
we can have five plates and not get
beat by mediocre people who were,

985
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:31,261
no,

986
00:29:31,261 --> 00:29:36,261
he's going to beat and get the same
money or more so it doesn't make sense.

987
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,220
So this is why me wild.

988
00:29:38,221 --> 00:29:41,560
Everyone agreed to fight
because at one time or another,

989
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,510
it's got to be more than about money.

990
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,980
Like we're fighters were.

991
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:45,371
Wherever you were,

992
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:46,300
tell me is the world,

993
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:47,081
of course,

994
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:48,550
we've made money in our careers,

995
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,440
have a 28 professional fight,

996
00:29:50,441 --> 00:29:51,790
27 professional flights.

997
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:52,893
I've made money.

998
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,700
It's about more than Molly now.

999
00:29:54,701 --> 00:29:58,390
Surely if I spend the money have
already wasted and I'm stupid,

1000
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,360
then 200 million would be no good
to me because I'd spend anyway,

1001
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,433
right?

1002
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,560
We Dot always has a felony.

1003
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,140
He's mourning is very easily part of it.

1004
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,660
But that's another story for another day.

1005
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,550
Going back on to this fight,

1006
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:14,910
we owe it to the funds to gave them a
proper fight of two so called people who

1007
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:17,410
think that the best.

1008
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,813
Let's prove it.

1009
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,960
It wasn't a hard negotiation thing on
a steel Neeva when me and wild hope you

1010
00:30:22,961 --> 00:30:24,070
don't mind and hope he's team,

1011
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:27,730
don't mind me saying that
they were the most terrorist,

1012
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,770
more straight going people
I've ever worked with.

1013
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,170
There was no if buts or maybes.

1014
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,520
Wherever I asked for,

1015
00:30:33,521 --> 00:30:34,650
they agreed and I have it.

1016
00:30:34,651 --> 00:30:35,240
He asked for,

1017
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,073
I've agreed to.

1018
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,151
There was no,

1019
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:38,710
it was no hard negotiations.

1020
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:39,191
It was very,

1021
00:30:39,191 --> 00:30:40,030
very simple.

1022
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,260
Wild,

1023
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:41,880
clearly

1024
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,320
seems to want to prove that he's the best.

1025
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:44,740
Um,

1026
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,900
I've got to admire him for that.

1027
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:46,250
Myra,

1028
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:46,771
that as well.

1029
00:30:46,771 --> 00:30:46,951
I mean,

1030
00:30:46,951 --> 00:30:47,910
he's got a title,

1031
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,751
he's undefeated.

1032
00:30:48,751 --> 00:30:49,800
He's smashing everybody.

1033
00:30:49,801 --> 00:30:53,670
They put in front of them and
he has a legacy on his mind.

1034
00:30:53,671 --> 00:30:54,361
He wants to leave.

1035
00:30:54,361 --> 00:30:57,120
A real legacy is why
he looked to fight you.

1036
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:57,661
Yeah.

1037
00:30:57,661 --> 00:31:01,530
I believe that I've got to give Deontay
wilder a lot of credit and respect for

1038
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,600
an aberration because he seems to be that
he was the only man at the time before

1039
00:31:06,661 --> 00:31:07,560
I was even coming back.

1040
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:12,330
He was willing to risk everything he's
got to prove is the best and isn't that

1041
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:13,410
what flight is about?

1042
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,700
Where men want to prove to
the best of all the others.

1043
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,001
No,

1044
00:31:17,001 --> 00:31:19,760
he's absolutely behaving
like a true champion.

1045
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:19,941
I mean,

1046
00:31:19,941 --> 00:31:20,690
that's what everybody,

1047
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:21,770
that's what fans want.

1048
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,600
They want a guy like
that and a guy like you,

1049
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,143
I,

1050
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:29,600
I've got admire him because to
pick me a six hot nine mover,

1051
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,081
Ooh,

1052
00:31:30,081 --> 00:31:33,020
slick and fast and can do awkward things,

1053
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:33,501
tussle,

1054
00:31:33,501 --> 00:31:34,334
awkward fight for him.

1055
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,980
He could have picked
more cheesier opponents

1056
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,840
on May similar money bolt.

1057
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:42,763
He didn't,

1058
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:43,940
he opted for the toughest one.

1059
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,190
Oh,

1060
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:47,810
still could test our respect him for
that and I take me out off to him.

1061
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:48,771
Well,

1062
00:31:48,771 --> 00:31:50,360
I think this is going to be a giant fight.

1063
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:53,570
I really do because this is what
everybody's been wanting for a long time.

1064
00:31:53,571 --> 00:31:56,420
It's so difficult to get people
excited about the heavyweight division.

1065
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:56,781
I mean,

1066
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,730
Joshua was a giant fan in the UK,

1067
00:31:58,731 --> 00:31:59,840
but worldwide,

1068
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,591
not so much.

1069
00:32:00,591 --> 00:32:01,250
Not so much.

1070
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,480
And Deontay wilder,

1071
00:32:02,481 --> 00:32:04,430
even though he's had
these spectacular results,

1072
00:32:04,431 --> 00:32:06,990
he needs that big thing too.

1073
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,270
To put him over the top.

1074
00:32:08,271 --> 00:32:09,560
The Ortiz fight helped,

1075
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,670
but he needs something more to,

1076
00:32:11,671 --> 00:32:13,430
to capture the real,

1077
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,091
the,

1078
00:32:14,091 --> 00:32:14,311
the,

1079
00:32:14,311 --> 00:32:16,010
the love of the American public,

1080
00:32:16,011 --> 00:32:17,120
the love of the world.

1081
00:32:17,121 --> 00:32:19,340
He just hasn't quite grabbed it yet.

1082
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:20,430
[inaudible] on.

1083
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,000
I do feel sorry for him in a way,

1084
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:25,840
because he has had for two professional
fights and knocked out nearly

1085
00:32:25,841 --> 00:32:26,880
everybody's calls.

1086
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,750
He should be a huge superstar.

1087
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,111
Shouldn't be,

1088
00:32:29,111 --> 00:32:29,740
but he's not.

1089
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,910
I go down the street,

1090
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:31,661
whatever.

1091
00:32:31,661 --> 00:32:31,931
I am,

1092
00:32:31,931 --> 00:32:32,561
New York,

1093
00:32:32,561 --> 00:32:33,341
Los Angeles,

1094
00:32:33,341 --> 00:32:34,174
big bear.

1095
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,730
And if I have 50 people
whose Deontay wilder,

1096
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,260
maybe one might even recognize the name.

1097
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,520
And someone even said,

1098
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:41,301
I recognize the name.

1099
00:32:41,301 --> 00:32:42,160
Is he a ballplayer?

1100
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,550
Is he a hockey player?

1101
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,181
I said,

1102
00:32:44,181 --> 00:32:44,331
no,

1103
00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:45,890
he's heavyweight champion of the world.

1104
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,410
It's crazy because he's a flashy dresser.

1105
00:32:48,411 --> 00:32:49,730
He's a great talker.

1106
00:32:49,731 --> 00:32:52,310
He knocks people and do
another fucking dimension.

1107
00:32:52,311 --> 00:32:54,050
He's a wild guy to watch fight.

1108
00:32:54,051 --> 00:32:55,310
He's very exciting.

1109
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,450
It's just,

1110
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:57,290
he's got all the,

1111
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:57,950
Eh,

1112
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,600
he's just waiting for the big moment.

1113
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,690
And maybe this fight is the
big moment for one of you.

1114
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:04,350
It is.

1115
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,183
Um,

1116
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,620
they think it's so much to do with the
heavyweight division's been in Europe for

1117
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:13,040
the last 15 years and been put to sleep.

1118
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,360
I believe that too.

1119
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:17,390
The thing about Klitschko
is even though he was very,

1120
00:33:17,391 --> 00:33:21,980
very successful and his style was
amazing in terms of his success rate,

1121
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:22,971
God damn,

1122
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:24,170
those fights were born to watch.

1123
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:25,910
Nobody gave a shit about those fights.

1124
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,361
No.

1125
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:27,200
Outside Europe,

1126
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,303
Germany,

1127
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,600
global phenomenon.

1128
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:29,751
Well,

1129
00:33:29,751 --> 00:33:31,240
they were just happy lived in Germany,

1130
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,120
was speaking German.

1131
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:32,681
He ate,

1132
00:33:32,681 --> 00:33:33,770
sell out 50,000,

1133
00:33:33,771 --> 00:33:36,110
60,000 fight in and nobody,

1134
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:36,440
I mean,

1135
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:36,970
it was a,

1136
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:38,990
a wonderful investment for him.

1137
00:33:38,991 --> 00:33:39,570
I mean,

1138
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,850
no disrespect to him.

1139
00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:42,230
He's a great boxer for sure.

1140
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:43,064
But

1141
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,870
boxing is,

1142
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:47,810
it's entertainment as well as sport,

1143
00:33:47,811 --> 00:33:49,550
especially for the casual person.

1144
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:50,271
You know,

1145
00:33:50,271 --> 00:33:50,571
I mean,

1146
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:50,750
I,

1147
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,590
if I watch,

1148
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:51,950
uh,

1149
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:52,550
uh,

1150
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,720
great boxer,

1151
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,320
just,

1152
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:54,890
just,

1153
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:55,251
you know,

1154
00:33:55,251 --> 00:33:57,650
box well and play it safe,

1155
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,330
I can be very impressed with that.

1156
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,000
But the average person is
not going to be impressed.

1157
00:34:02,001 --> 00:34:04,070
You're not going to get
some paper view dollars,

1158
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,513
hundred percent of them.

1159
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,390
I can't sit here and pretend to most,

1160
00:34:08,391 --> 00:34:11,870
some of my fights have been the most
exciting fights in the wild becomes my

1161
00:34:11,871 --> 00:34:15,770
biggest fight of my whole Korea
was a 12 round snooze fest.

1162
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:16,610
I'm,

1163
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:16,901
I'm,

1164
00:34:16,901 --> 00:34:17,810
I don't have to say that.

1165
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,481
Hi,

1166
00:34:19,481 --> 00:34:22,190
I'm amount of Avala and I
will tell you the truth.

1167
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,050
I can't even watch a fight back.

1168
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,741
It was all boring.

1169
00:34:24,741 --> 00:34:25,610
It didn't think it was Bob.

1170
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:30,320
He was to box in people who know boxing
to know hard while I was doing is to do

1171
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,340
as a heavyweight and
the scale and all that.

1172
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:36,410
But like you say to the average Joe who
knows nothing about box and he wants to

1173
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:38,480
see two big men punch the
shit out of each other.

1174
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,940
It was a boring fight to,

1175
00:34:40,941 --> 00:34:43,570
that's why Joshua gets
more credit for each.

1176
00:34:43,571 --> 00:34:46,340
Went over Klitschko even though he got
popped down and really knocked out than I

1177
00:34:46,341 --> 00:34:46,850
did.

1178
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:50,370
And Klitschko didn't love the glove on
me because their fight was 50 50 I knew

1179
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,770
it was locking arms off each other,

1180
00:34:51,771 --> 00:34:55,460
but my fight was like 80 20 in my
favor where I didn't get torched.

1181
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:57,770
But that still was spectacular.

1182
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,980
He was watching it as a fight fan.

1183
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:01,581
First of all,

1184
00:35:01,581 --> 00:35:05,390
it was no disrespect to Klitschko
but it was like finally,

1185
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,770
finally somebody figured this dude out
because there had been moments where

1186
00:35:09,771 --> 00:35:10,340
people had,

1187
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:10,790
you know,

1188
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:11,900
tested him a little bit,

1189
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,810
but it had been a long time
before somebody had beaten him.

1190
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:15,501
It don't,

1191
00:35:15,501 --> 00:35:16,850
it had been there 11 years.

1192
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:17,803
Yeah,

1193
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,780
but that isn't always been my style.

1194
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,860
Boxing on the back foot,

1195
00:35:21,861 --> 00:35:22,510
slip and slide,

1196
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,950
I'm adjust to different
opponents loud to me,

1197
00:35:24,951 --> 00:35:28,460
I'd dynamite in his right hand regardless
of his boring style or whatever.

1198
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:32,600
If he made a mistake once in
that fight you get knocked out.

1199
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,520
Eddie Chambers,

1200
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,470
so many Samuel Peters,

1201
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:41,100
everybody list goes on
and on and on and on.

1202
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:44,810
Everybody knocked out 65 knockouts and
he would make you desperate because of

1203
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:47,090
that style cause that grab,

1204
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,690
Jab and grab style.

1205
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,290
People would get desperate and they
would open themselves up and then getting

1206
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,880
out toe and I didn't want to be
on that list of knockouts bought.

1207
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,160
I've been,

1208
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,550
I've been in fights where he's been total
walls for as long as the fight lasted.

1209
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:00,180
Aida,

1210
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:04,320
Steve Calling on fight 2013 I'll come
out here or come from Iran or straight

1211
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:05,010
onto an overrun,

1212
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,150
right and down.

1213
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:10,280
I was looking enough up Mallesons glad
God and roof the lights and the off 12

1214
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:10,801
fuck me.

1215
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:12,030
It's now back to the farm boy.

1216
00:36:12,031 --> 00:36:12,864
Get up.

1217
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,190
What's Cunningham?

1218
00:36:14,191 --> 00:36:17,640
A difficult opponent because he
was shorter than you calling them.

1219
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,100
Believe it or not in this
going to sound strange.

1220
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,620
Calling him was the
hardest fight I ever did.

1221
00:36:22,621 --> 00:36:24,930
Have a whole Korea
amateur or professional.

1222
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,520
The reason B and he was very slippery
the way I explained calling them.

1223
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,280
It was like a Conga real all
full of oil in front of me.

1224
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,570
I can pin him down.

1225
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,040
He was light on his feet.

1226
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:37,480
He was weighing 208 pounds
or something Peyser way,

1227
00:36:37,481 --> 00:36:37,830
right?

1228
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:38,550
He was a,

1229
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,110
he was a three time cruiserweight champ,

1230
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:41,880
middle the world and he
stepped up into heavyweights.

1231
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,320
He was a slick,

1232
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,110
talented boxer and I,

1233
00:36:46,111 --> 00:36:47,220
I tried to walk him down,

1234
00:36:47,221 --> 00:36:48,510
use me size and power,

1235
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,100
but he's just out box in me.

1236
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:50,761
What?

1237
00:36:50,761 --> 00:36:51,594
I'm good at.

1238
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:52,610
Boxing move in,

1239
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,520
slipping and sliding.

1240
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,820
I couldn't do against Dave
couldn't come because he was too,

1241
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,900
he was quicker than me.

1242
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:58,590
He was,

1243
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,423
he was,

1244
00:36:59,460 --> 00:36:59,941
he was like,

1245
00:36:59,941 --> 00:37:01,440
it was a better boxer all around to me.

1246
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,230
I couldn't do nothing with him and he'd
knocked me over and even though he was a

1247
00:37:04,231 --> 00:37:06,450
light punch her supposedly what?

1248
00:37:06,451 --> 00:37:08,040
Right onto it come from
the back of the hole.

1249
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:11,090
They go over and write right
in the Chin and the fall,

1250
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,980
this has hit us day B
have been knocked out.

1251
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,500
I fought Tyson theory,

1252
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:18,390
get up and kick his ass.

1253
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:22,340
So I got up and I just went straight
forward our team and I thought no mailbox

1254
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:24,120
and now I'm going to hit
him around in the body,

1255
00:37:24,121 --> 00:37:24,960
pull them up through the middle,

1256
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,890
rounder corners.

1257
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,890
You might be ahead on points but
sooner or later I'm going to get you.

1258
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:30,870
And I did in round seven.

1259
00:37:30,871 --> 00:37:33,600
I felt him going week cause
I was just pushing him back,

1260
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:36,120
pushing him back and he's hitting me
gloves and hitting me face and hit me

1261
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:37,050
everywhere basically.

1262
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,050
But I walked right through
everything when regard up.

1263
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:40,800
Um,

1264
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,490
after he got tired I am of a heavy
body shot and round seven and he didn't

1265
00:37:44,491 --> 00:37:46,920
recover an had pushed his head back and
knocked him clean out with the right

1266
00:37:46,921 --> 00:37:47,610
talent.

1267
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,590
That was the only time he was
ever knocked out when his career,

1268
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:50,903
even to today,

1269
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,740
it seemed like in that fight,

1270
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,490
perhaps one of the more difficult things
was adjusting to the fact that he was

1271
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:57,570
so much smaller than you.

1272
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,081
Six,

1273
00:37:58,081 --> 00:37:59,070
six 43 was,

1274
00:37:59,071 --> 00:37:59,490
yeah.

1275
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:00,020
Yeah.

1276
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:03,600
Didn't you were just took you
a while to adjust to that.

1277
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:05,130
Like I say,

1278
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,720
I'm not going to make any excuses.

1279
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,150
Steve Conning and was a
better boxer at American.

1280
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:09,800
Good fighter.

1281
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,260
Yeah.

1282
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,210
Small guy for the heavyweight division,

1283
00:38:12,211 --> 00:38:13,050
but a very good fighter.

1284
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,003
Very good.

1285
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:14,840
Like I said,

1286
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,740
the toughest money ever
face was still calling them.

1287
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,080
That's a high praise.

1288
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:23,820
So when you decided that you were going
to make this comeback and you're dealing

1289
00:38:23,821 --> 00:38:24,660
with all this,

1290
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,130
these mental health struggles,

1291
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,430
what did you do to overcome
the mental health problems?

1292
00:38:29,431 --> 00:38:31,350
What did you do to
overcome the depression?

1293
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,701
Like I say,

1294
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:36,520
when I got up off that floor and a weight
lifted off me and I had my mind set

1295
00:38:36,521 --> 00:38:39,640
for the first time in two years
till I wanted to do something again.

1296
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:43,270
I think the way to beat mental
health has setting goals,

1297
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:45,670
giving yourself short
term or long term goals.

1298
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,140
And that's what I did.

1299
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,310
That's very interesting.

1300
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:51,220
I give myself a goal of losing the weight,

1301
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,700
pound by pound.

1302
00:38:54,701 --> 00:38:55,534
Basically.

1303
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,980
I'll set myself a 10 pound,

1304
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:58,000
um,

1305
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,340
target and I'd reached out and,

1306
00:38:59,341 --> 00:39:00,520
and I sent myself and have a 10 pound,

1307
00:39:00,521 --> 00:39:01,450
15 pound whatever,

1308
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,210
and I'd give myself a
little rewards and stuff.

1309
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:06,010
I wasn't obviously eating junk food.

1310
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:10,660
I was on a strict diet for six months
and I was training twice a day,

1311
00:39:10,661 --> 00:39:10,961
six,

1312
00:39:10,961 --> 00:39:11,830
seven days a week.

1313
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,890
But with the mental health,

1314
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,280
I don't suffer with mental
health when I'm active one,

1315
00:39:18,281 --> 00:39:19,114
I've got a goal.

1316
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,270
How do I think most people
will vouch for this?

1317
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,430
If you suffer with mental health problems,

1318
00:39:24,431 --> 00:39:26,110
you tend to suffer on
when you're on your own,

1319
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:29,530
when you've got a lot of time to
think and when you're not doing much.

1320
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,810
But when you busy on a daily basis,

1321
00:39:31,811 --> 00:39:34,780
you don't have enough time
to think about mental health.

1322
00:39:34,781 --> 00:39:36,370
And I figured out,

1323
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:36,741
well,

1324
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,320
if I exhaust myself in the gym,

1325
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,360
I come on,

1326
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,650
I'm too tired to think about anything.

1327
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:42,100
I just want to get some
food and go to bed.

1328
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,080
So that's what I do.

1329
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:46,430
So you didn't use medication?

1330
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,920
I didn't use medication,

1331
00:39:47,921 --> 00:39:48,520
no.

1332
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,000
Wow.

1333
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,320
I will say I was prescribed
with medication from the doctor,

1334
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,180
but I refuse to take it.

1335
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,490
I took a couple of pills,

1336
00:39:57,491 --> 00:39:58,070
helped me software,

1337
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:58,903
lax

1338
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,061
from the doctor.

1339
00:40:01,061 --> 00:40:01,960
Bhat never took them again.

1340
00:40:01,961 --> 00:40:02,920
I only ever taco couple.

1341
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:03,783
Would they give you,

1342
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:07,170
I think it was like [inaudible]
pan try Ozzie panel,

1343
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:07,761
something like that.

1344
00:40:07,761 --> 00:40:08,720
Some antidepressants,

1345
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,000
some antidepressant pill.

1346
00:40:10,001 --> 00:40:10,810
Yeah.

1347
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:13,270
But I've done research on them and
I didn't like what I was seeing.

1348
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:14,471
Like on.

1349
00:40:14,471 --> 00:40:16,120
I knew my grandfather,

1350
00:40:16,121 --> 00:40:16,954
my dad's dad,

1351
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,030
he was addicted to pills his whole life.

1352
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,100
Pells that didn't even
do anything for him.

1353
00:40:21,101 --> 00:40:22,450
There was placebo pills,

1354
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:25,090
but without him he
couldn't function really.

1355
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:30,970
So I didn't want to become one of them
macaron dough to take pills and they

1356
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:31,804
didn't do anything to him.

1357
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,820
Put it in his own mind.

1358
00:40:33,821 --> 00:40:34,061
He fought,

1359
00:40:34,061 --> 00:40:37,180
they were doing something
calming him down and I didn't,

1360
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,860
didn't want to be one of them people.

1361
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,260
There was a point in my life
where I haven't done hard fought.

1362
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,820
I was gonna end up in a padded room.

1363
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,250
Lots of body was.

1364
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,930
But it's fascinating that you're saying
that setting goals and setting your mind

1365
00:40:54,931 --> 00:40:58,800
on things and hard training
is what set you back on track.

1366
00:40:58,970 --> 00:40:59,311
You know,

1367
00:40:59,311 --> 00:41:01,920
I don't know what you're like when
there's no one in front of you,

1368
00:41:01,921 --> 00:41:03,480
but standing here in
front of you right now,

1369
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,040
I would say this is a healthy,

1370
00:41:05,041 --> 00:41:06,030
vibrant guy.

1371
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,780
100% I've never felt better,

1372
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:09,670
mentally strong physically.

1373
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:10,900
I've trained in hard fail,

1374
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:11,830
fit as a fiddle.

1375
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,620
You know,

1376
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:15,070
I wouldn't be here if I
was anything wrong with me,

1377
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:19,130
but as fascinating that most people think
that to come back from a mental health

1378
00:41:19,131 --> 00:41:20,090
issue like yours,

1379
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,480
you need psychiatric care
and you need medication.

1380
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:27,320
And your saying you did it with
setting goals and hard work.

1381
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:30,630
And the biggest thing we're
missing here is I didn't,

1382
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:31,231
I didn't do it.

1383
00:41:31,231 --> 00:41:32,430
We're doctors and um,

1384
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,860
all of type of things,

1385
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:34,881
I don't know.

1386
00:41:34,881 --> 00:41:36,350
It was something way more powerful.

1387
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,753
God.

1388
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,830
So your faith and your belief,

1389
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:40,191
me,

1390
00:41:40,191 --> 00:41:43,460
faith and belief that God would
make me better made me better.

1391
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,210
Almost like faith.

1392
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:47,840
Any faith will think,

1393
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:48,051
oh,

1394
00:41:48,051 --> 00:41:49,730
is this nonsense or whatever book.

1395
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,280
I'm living proof.

1396
00:41:51,281 --> 00:41:54,830
Well if you believe in something and just
like you were talking about believing

1397
00:41:54,831 --> 00:41:56,300
in pills that don't do anything,

1398
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,920
belief is a powerful thing.

1399
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,030
Whether it,

1400
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,590
who knows what's behind that belief.

1401
00:42:00,591 --> 00:42:05,591
But what you're saying is so powerful
that you just by virtue of changing the

1402
00:42:06,201 --> 00:42:07,610
way you think about things,

1403
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:08,990
setting goals,

1404
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,130
working hard,

1405
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,480
you lifted yourself out of the worst
depression of your life to the point where

1406
00:42:14,481 --> 00:42:15,440
you were suicidal.

1407
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:16,953
Hundred percent.

1408
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:21,260
And I've never ever went back to that
from this data out and it's been been one

1409
00:42:21,261 --> 00:42:22,280
over 12 months.

1410
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:23,540
That's pretty amazing.

1411
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,374
I mean it's just amazing.

1412
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:27,950
That's an amazing thing for people to
hear because there's a lot of people that

1413
00:42:27,951 --> 00:42:31,390
rely heavily on
antidepressants and medication.

1414
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:36,350
They think that is the only way for
them to be happy and for them to be not

1415
00:42:36,351 --> 00:42:36,951
suicidal,

1416
00:42:36,951 --> 00:42:37,641
not depressed.

1417
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:39,140
They need that medication.

1418
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,760
And for them to hear what your saying
I think is a very powerful thing.

1419
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:45,650
It is bull.

1420
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:46,483
I'm no doctor.

1421
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:50,180
I'm not going to tell people to
chuck away your pills and right,

1422
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,610
but it doesn't do any arm.

1423
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:53,241
What I'm saying?

1424
00:42:53,241 --> 00:42:54,074
Give it a whirl.

1425
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,111
Give it a try.

1426
00:42:55,111 --> 00:42:55,701
It can't hurt.

1427
00:42:55,701 --> 00:42:56,100
Yeah,

1428
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,380
set yourself some goals.

1429
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,620
Think positive and a crack
on Derby at training.

1430
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,573
So from,

1431
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:04,130
from accomplishing your ultimate goal,

1432
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,390
beating Klitschko,

1433
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:09,350
becoming the heavyweight champion
and then falling into this deep funk,

1434
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:12,560
do you think you had to go through
all this to come back again?

1435
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:13,521
I think so,

1436
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:14,354
yeah.

1437
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,300
I believe I was being tested
to see what type of motto.

1438
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,100
Awesome.

1439
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,300
What type of character I out.

1440
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:21,613
And you know,

1441
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,530
even before the depression
I didn't appreciate things,

1442
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:25,490
nothing,

1443
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:26,690
nothing was value to me.

1444
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:27,951
So even swimming,

1445
00:43:27,951 --> 00:43:28,401
cad work,

1446
00:43:28,401 --> 00:43:29,234
Todd fall,

1447
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,670
if I'd worked hard and saved up for a car,

1448
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:34,340
just say for five minutes,

1449
00:43:34,341 --> 00:43:36,040
say blk but then I won't want anymore.

1450
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:36,890
It was piece of shit.

1451
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,410
So I know if it mattered to me,

1452
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:40,400
I didn't value anything,

1453
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:46,210
anything that I had and I've worked hard
for and everyone knows like what I have

1454
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:51,590
is blood money because I pay for him
in face and their body gets punched to

1455
00:43:51,591 --> 00:43:52,970
pieces for what I have.

1456
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,120
So you'd think I'd appreciate
things more than an x mumble.

1457
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,920
I didn't appreciate nothing.

1458
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,320
I didn't appreciate anything,

1459
00:43:59,330 --> 00:43:59,741
anything a,

1460
00:43:59,741 --> 00:44:02,510
our daughter achieved
even world championships.

1461
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,450
Anything I thought is that it
does this whole your whole life.

1462
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:08,890
So I believe I was taught,

1463
00:44:08,891 --> 00:44:11,690
I was popped down this road and I had
to suffer all these things so I could

1464
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,540
understand one hour things.

1465
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:14,383
God.

1466
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:18,750
Like today I'm up here that I'm
breathe in fresh air and the,

1467
00:44:18,751 --> 00:44:18,970
um,

1468
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:20,330
I'm sat here in a mental,

1469
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:22,760
mentally stable way of thinking.

1470
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:28,310
I'm happy that I can go out and
enjoy your dinner and just be normal,

1471
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,510
whatever that is.

1472
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:31,740
That's what I'm up before.

1473
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,230
I'm one of the most,

1474
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:37,110
probably the most unique
paypal's you'll ever meet.

1475
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:38,003
I'm not.

1476
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:42,240
I'm orientated by material things and
all that sort of stuff means nothing to

1477
00:44:42,241 --> 00:44:43,074
me.

1478
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,560
I don't even care about glory and honor.

1479
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,450
I don't care about legacies.

1480
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:51,780
I don't care about winning titles or or,

1481
00:44:51,781 --> 00:44:54,150
or metals doesn't matter.

1482
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,090
But when I set my mind to doing something,

1483
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:57,990
I'll do it.

1484
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:01,140
And every single time I've ever sent
me mind to anything I've done it.

1485
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:04,950
Even you'll thinkable things
of a set your mind to,

1486
00:45:04,951 --> 00:45:05,784
I've done it.

1487
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:08,350
I don't care about one in
what Deontay wilder has,

1488
00:45:08,351 --> 00:45:09,480
it needs positional ever.

1489
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,220
I only want to beat him in a fight.

1490
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,083
Does it?

1491
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:15,210
You only want to beat him
because it's so difficult.

1492
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:16,921
Not just that,

1493
00:45:16,921 --> 00:45:17,980
because that's what I want to do.

1494
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:18,091
Well,

1495
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:19,800
what sets your soul set me goal?

1496
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:20,461
Beaten.

1497
00:45:20,461 --> 00:45:21,390
Deontay wilder.

1498
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,680
So do you think that that's the,

1499
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:26,500
your future is just setting goals and
constantly trying to achieve those goals?

1500
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:27,460
I think.

1501
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,590
I think I've got a bigger
purpose now than boxing.

1502
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,500
Boxing is a sport and some ankle.

1503
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,160
I've made a living now for a long time,

1504
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,220
but I think there's a bigger
picture bigger than any,

1505
00:45:36,221 --> 00:45:36,910
any women,

1506
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:39,070
any titles bigger than when in any,

1507
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,060
any fights,

1508
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:41,560
any number of fights.

1509
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,980
I think my calling card in life
has to spread the word on this.

1510
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:46,690
This disease are silent killer.

1511
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:48,250
I killed her.

1512
00:45:48,251 --> 00:45:53,251
That's so far Oceanus that you can't
see it or feel it from the outside.

1513
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:56,800
You could be suffering right now,

1514
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:59,860
but I won't be able to see it
because I can't see into your mind.

1515
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:04,940
It's just so unusual that
someone has that solution,

1516
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,140
that hard work,

1517
00:46:06,141 --> 00:46:10,100
dedication and setting goals is what
lifted you out of the depression and made

1518
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:13,730
you appreciate life and
made you appreciate all the,

1519
00:46:13,731 --> 00:46:14,870
all the aspects of it.

1520
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,140
Yup.

1521
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,100
I appreciate everything.

1522
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:17,490
You know,

1523
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:18,780
spending time with my family.

1524
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:21,690
I took it for granted before for
I spend nine when Tom went family.

1525
00:46:21,691 --> 00:46:22,670
Anytime a warm,

1526
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:28,500
I couldn't put into words
what I went through.

1527
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:28,811
Well,

1528
00:46:28,811 --> 00:46:29,644
let me just say,

1529
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:33,240
I wouldn't wish what I went
through on my worst enemy.

1530
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,530
Not that I have any enemies,

1531
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:35,820
but if I did,

1532
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:39,720
I wouldn't wish on a soul
because I know art is,

1533
00:46:39,721 --> 00:46:41,550
and I know unless a person,

1534
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:42,301
maybe not,

1535
00:46:42,301 --> 00:46:46,020
I've got through or maybe
not a man without faith may
woulda took his own life.

1536
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,400
Now that you have gotten through,

1537
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,880
do you feel like you have the solution
now to navigate the rest of your life?

1538
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,793
Yeah.

1539
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:56,850
I now know the secret for me and
everybody's will be different.

1540
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,700
But if I train every day
and I'm staying in shape,

1541
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,200
then I'll be happy forever.

1542
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:05,880
The time I stopped training the Tamar
balloon back up again to tell him it all

1543
00:47:05,881 --> 00:47:06,660
goes wrong again.

1544
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:10,020
And I know that if you know something
in your life and you don't do it,

1545
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:11,903
and that's what I know.

1546
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,290
It's like a diabetic.

1547
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,550
If he goes and eats a lot of sugar,

1548
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,350
he knows he's going to make
him out so we don't do it.

1549
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,250
So as long as I always
stay by them guidelines,

1550
00:47:20,251 --> 00:47:21,320
I know I'm going to be all right.

1551
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:22,741
Not Sell Shit.

1552
00:47:22,741 --> 00:47:22,860
Right.

1553
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:23,693
He wrote

1554
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,020
so as long as well that's
the other thing too,

1555
00:47:26,021 --> 00:47:26,321
right?

1556
00:47:26,321 --> 00:47:30,370
The alcohol and the drugs
exacerbate any sort of bad

1557
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,500
state that you have because
you're going to feel like shit.

1558
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:33,760
Yeah.

1559
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,810
I'm not tee total.

1560
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:35,883
Right.

1561
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,630
I've had a drink since I've been back.

1562
00:47:37,631 --> 00:47:40,330
I Bet I've been out
with a large our drinks,

1563
00:47:40,331 --> 00:47:41,164
whatever.

1564
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:42,223
Um,

1565
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,990
but your goals are still set and strong.

1566
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:44,873
Yeah.

1567
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:46,510
But really what it is.

1568
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:47,373
Yeah.

1569
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:49,300
So from now on,

1570
00:47:49,301 --> 00:47:51,610
you just have to continue
any set goals in your life,

1571
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:52,391
set goals,

1572
00:47:52,391 --> 00:47:53,350
whatever those goals might be.

1573
00:47:53,351 --> 00:47:55,570
They don't have to be massive goals,

1574
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:58,270
but they can be anything really.

1575
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:02,140
Anything that I want to do or I want
to achieve or I want to go someplace or

1576
00:48:02,141 --> 00:48:02,950
whatever,

1577
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:04,990
and I worked towards it
and set myself a goal.

1578
00:48:04,991 --> 00:48:06,700
It's almost like a
little treat or whatever.

1579
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:09,430
It's fascinating because no
one's ever really connected that.

1580
00:48:09,431 --> 00:48:09,641
I mean,

1581
00:48:09,641 --> 00:48:09,881
people,

1582
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:13,390
people have made that connection in terms
of like when they study happy people,

1583
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:15,550
one of the things they
find about happy people's,

1584
00:48:15,551 --> 00:48:17,080
the goal oriented people,

1585
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,670
they set goals to accomplish those people.

1586
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:23,670
But nobody's ever really set that as
a remedy for depression and for mental

1587
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:25,390
health issues,

1588
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:26,050
setting goals,

1589
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:26,980
achieving those goals.

1590
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:28,450
That's the key to keep it going.

1591
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:30,220
I believe that's the case.

1592
00:48:30,221 --> 00:48:30,700
Yeah.

1593
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,320
After doing quite a lot of research on,

1594
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:37,380
on myself and experiencing it and it
works for me and I find it works for a lot

1595
00:48:37,421 --> 00:48:39,790
of people I speak to who's
got the same problems.

1596
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:43,520
I get messages from all all over the world
from different types of sports people

1597
00:48:43,521 --> 00:48:47,710
and different types of people asking
for information and help on how I,

1598
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,310
I got free mine and what
I did and I'm happy to,

1599
00:48:51,311 --> 00:48:52,150
I'm up here to help.

1600
00:48:52,151 --> 00:48:54,610
So if there's anybody out there
who's struggling in silence,

1601
00:48:54,611 --> 00:48:56,590
which a lot of people are turned,

1602
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:58,060
I'm always there to help if I can.

1603
00:48:58,220 --> 00:48:58,400
Well,

1604
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,960
it's such an impressive and inspiring
message because you're doing it without

1605
00:49:01,961 --> 00:49:02,740
medication.

1606
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:05,200
You're doing it just
through positive thinking,

1607
00:49:05,201 --> 00:49:07,330
through goal setting and
through healthy living.

1608
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:08,583
That's right.

1609
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,550
And I believe it's the best,

1610
00:49:09,551 --> 00:49:10,570
best way to live anyway.

1611
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:12,640
That's the way to live is fit and healthy.

1612
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,830
When you're out of shape
and you feel unfit.

1613
00:49:14,831 --> 00:49:17,560
And you feel terrible and nothing's
going to go right for you.

1614
00:49:17,561 --> 00:49:19,090
But if you feel fit,

1615
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:21,423
you feel good.

1616
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:25,810
It's almost natural to feel depressed
if your body is literally depressed.

1617
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:29,590
If every time I go to the gym
and do a little bit of training,

1618
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:30,880
whether it be a lot more metal,

1619
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:33,340
I always go out of a shower
and I think I feel great.

1620
00:49:33,341 --> 00:49:35,940
Now training sets off an
endorphin and you blow it.

1621
00:49:35,941 --> 00:49:36,774
It makes you happy.

1622
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:39,490
Contentment is a word we're looking for.

1623
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,110
Contentment doesn't come free.

1624
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:42,130
Material stuff,

1625
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,360
jobs,

1626
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:44,710
positions,

1627
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:45,221
fame,

1628
00:49:45,221 --> 00:49:45,641
glory,

1629
00:49:45,641 --> 00:49:45,881
money,

1630
00:49:45,881 --> 00:49:46,540
anything.

1631
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:47,030
Content.

1632
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:48,760
You'll never find a temp
and while you're chasing,

1633
00:49:48,761 --> 00:49:49,594
and that's all stuff,

1634
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:52,390
my message would be,

1635
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:57,070
look around yourself and be
thankful for what you do have today.

1636
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,350
Don't look for what you don't have.

1637
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:00,490
You know,

1638
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:01,080
you gotta be happy.

1639
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,380
Be happy with who you are.

1640
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:04,000
And why is my mom said,

1641
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,550
you've got to know yourself
before you can know anybody else.

1642
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:10,030
She told me yourself trying
to understand yourself.

1643
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:13,360
Think what makes you happy and
do that and what makes you sad.

1644
00:50:13,361 --> 00:50:13,851
Don't do it.

1645
00:50:13,851 --> 00:50:14,531
It's very simple.

1646
00:50:14,531 --> 00:50:15,364
Rarely.

1647
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:15,671
If so,

1648
00:50:15,671 --> 00:50:16,870
it makes me sad now,

1649
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:18,550
then I'm not going to do any more teeth.

1650
00:50:18,551 --> 00:50:19,031
I want my life.

1651
00:50:19,031 --> 00:50:19,864
I don't want to.

1652
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,840
And if you know somebody can lead you
down the wrong way and a wrong path in

1653
00:50:22,841 --> 00:50:23,530
life,

1654
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:24,363
don't do it.

1655
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:25,480
Simple,

1656
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,313
very simple.

1657
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:27,380
Say Self,

1658
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:28,460
small time goals.

1659
00:50:28,461 --> 00:50:31,340
Longtime goals achieved them and move on.

1660
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:33,860
Now how long did it take
you for you lose the weight?

1661
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,930
I started training in November,

1662
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:41,150
2017 400 pounds.

1663
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:41,820
Yeah,

1664
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:42,653
Ron.

1665
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:47,480
I got down to 275 pounds
in my first fight.

1666
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,550
Buck in June

1667
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:53,240
and by August and the second fight buck,

1668
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,490
I was 258 pounds.

1669
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:01,640
I don't know if I've maintained that
weight to 62 58 that's your ideal weight.

1670
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:01,971
Yeah.

1671
00:51:01,971 --> 00:51:02,810
From there to now.

1672
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:04,780
So,

1673
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:05,150
um,

1674
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:06,560
what did you do
differently with your diet?

1675
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:07,423
Like what did you

1676
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,730
I was eating a lot and drinking a lot.

1677
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,760
I just stopped all that sort of stuff.

1678
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:17,090
Like my weight wasn't bought
on fro being a normal person.

1679
00:51:17,091 --> 00:51:17,924
He normally,

1680
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:21,500
my weight was put on through
excessive drinking of lager,

1681
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:27,290
does like 500 calories in one pint of
beer and I'd go out and drink a minimum of

1682
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:28,520
18 of those beers,

1683
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,930
follow by whiskey or vodka,

1684
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:34,640
everything else.

1685
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,920
Then I'd stop off on the
way home and our pizzas,

1686
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:37,754
Kabobs,

1687
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:38,810
chocolates,

1688
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,300
it was excessive living.

1689
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:43,460
If he put your body through torture,

1690
00:51:43,461 --> 00:51:44,750
you can't expect to feel great.

1691
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:45,883
Right?

1692
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:48,320
So what I did was society in Alfie,

1693
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:49,213
not drinking

1694
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,153
and that was it earlier.

1695
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,180
I just trained on a daily basis
for a long period of time and at,

1696
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:57,470
at sensible and clean you off to court.

1697
00:51:57,471 --> 00:52:01,700
Every Vinno bought if you want
faster results and then you do it.

1698
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:04,010
Now you said you change
your training as well.

1699
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:05,750
What did you change up

1700
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,330
before?

1701
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:09,880
I was doing a lot of 'em

1702
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:16,510
along marooning and along boxing works
like 1215 rounds on the bug pad work,

1703
00:52:17,931 --> 00:52:18,764
all that sort of stuff.

1704
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:20,750
Where in while I was
trying to lose the weight,

1705
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,910
I was doing more short explosive stuff.

1706
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:25,220
Like I was doing short,

1707
00:52:25,221 --> 00:52:27,740
faster on such as fast
as I could go basically.

1708
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:29,023
Um,

1709
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:31,610
I would do more interval
training and stuff like that.

1710
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:34,400
Mainly it was a focusing on diet though.

1711
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:37,520
Diet's the most important thing for
any anybody trying to lose weight.

1712
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:41,390
You could train like a
Trojan warrior but not eight.

1713
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:41,751
Correct.

1714
00:52:41,751 --> 00:52:45,260
And you go three steps forward and two
and a half buck and you find yourself

1715
00:52:45,261 --> 00:52:46,010
after six months,

1716
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:47,330
a little bit less than yours,

1717
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:51,410
but he stay in the same
position because with the Diet,

1718
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,760
not that I'm a dietician,

1719
00:52:52,761 --> 00:52:53,450
but I know,

1720
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:56,930
I know it works with losing weight
heavy because he all the way through me

1721
00:52:56,931 --> 00:52:58,130
Korean upon a lot of weight,

1722
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,060
I lost a hundred hundred,

1723
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:02,180
just over a hundred pounds
for the Klitschko fight.

1724
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,050
The first time round

1725
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:09,080
I lost over on Andre and
2527th impound before that.

1726
00:53:09,081 --> 00:53:09,914
Again,

1727
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:12,800
so what I do to lose weight
as they go on a no carb diet,

1728
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:17,660
so it will be totally Keto ketosis diet.

1729
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:20,060
I put my body into Quito
shock and they say,

1730
00:53:20,061 --> 00:53:20,631
you should stay.

1731
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:21,920
If you do need Kito Diet,

1732
00:53:21,921 --> 00:53:23,330
you should only do it for 11 days.

1733
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,070
I do it for six to eight weeks.

1734
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,070
Who said you should only do

1735
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,770
it for 11 days are already somewhere.

1736
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:28,200
Yeah,

1737
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,100
my nutritionist.

1738
00:53:29,101 --> 00:53:29,341
Yeah.

1739
00:53:29,341 --> 00:53:29,671
He said,

1740
00:53:29,671 --> 00:53:30,180
no.

1741
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:30,481
He said,

1742
00:53:30,481 --> 00:53:32,370
you can only do this diet for 11 days.

1743
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:33,450
Has that have already been on it?

1744
00:53:33,451 --> 00:53:34,284
Six weeks.

1745
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,273
Don't worry about it.

1746
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:36,570
That's ridiculous.

1747
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:37,130
Yeah,

1748
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:37,500
do it.

1749
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,120
I know guys who've done it for years now.

1750
00:53:39,121 --> 00:53:39,750
He goes,

1751
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:40,940
it's a healthy way of living.

1752
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:43,560
It prevents diabetes and all
these types of things as well.

1753
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:44,940
There's definitely some benefits to it,

1754
00:53:44,941 --> 00:53:49,110
but there's concerns that for athletic
performance that you should have higher

1755
00:53:49,111 --> 00:53:50,040
carbohydrates.

1756
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:50,610
True,

1757
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:54,840
but at this time I was just focusing
on losing weight and the Keto Diet done

1758
00:53:54,841 --> 00:53:55,674
correct

1759
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:57,061
is okay,

1760
00:53:57,061 --> 00:53:58,200
but I was doing it dirty.

1761
00:53:58,410 --> 00:53:59,243
How are we doing it?

1762
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:03,660
How is Ivan for double parties
with cheese and mayonnaise?

1763
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,800
Is that bad full of fighting

1764
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,530
grace and it can't be
good for your arteries?

1765
00:54:09,531 --> 00:54:10,580
Kind of wow,

1766
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:11,473
this is a loan.

1767
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:13,820
I was often tunnels of meat,

1768
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:14,510
fried,

1769
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:17,000
fried with cheese,

1770
00:54:17,001 --> 00:54:17,834
mayonnaise,

1771
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:18,351
bacon,

1772
00:54:18,351 --> 00:54:18,651
eggs,

1773
00:54:18,651 --> 00:54:19,484
sausage,

1774
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:20,001
whatever.

1775
00:54:20,001 --> 00:54:20,510
Sounds good.

1776
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:21,291
My ideal diet,

1777
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:22,500
basically I was thinking,

1778
00:54:22,501 --> 00:54:23,360
this can't be a die.

1779
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:24,410
I'm not going to lose weight.

1780
00:54:24,411 --> 00:54:25,620
I miss and you lost weight.

1781
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:26,421
I lost the weight.

1782
00:54:26,421 --> 00:54:27,254
I lost it all.

1783
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:27,741
Yeah.

1784
00:54:27,741 --> 00:54:30,410
You'd be stunned at what is
actually healthy and what's not.

1785
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:31,703
Yeah.

1786
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:34,200
I suppose you can't go
wrong if he cooking meat,

1787
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:38,670
Walton to meet whatever they put in
in the beat for whatever it is you're

1788
00:54:38,671 --> 00:54:39,504
eating.

1789
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,320
Processed foods are the ones that got
all the additives and all that stuff.

1790
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:46,340
Processed foods and sugar
and bread and carbohydrates,

1791
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:48,620
especially refined carbohydrates.

1792
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,290
My life is,

1793
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:55,280
I don't avoid Futz Futz my friend.

1794
00:54:55,281 --> 00:54:56,114
Basically,

1795
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:57,560
if I look at food,

1796
00:54:57,561 --> 00:54:58,221
someone's on a diet,

1797
00:54:58,221 --> 00:54:59,630
they look at the fat content in something.

1798
00:54:59,631 --> 00:55:00,680
I don't look into sugar,

1799
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:01,580
right,

1800
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:03,230
because the thought I can burn fat off,

1801
00:55:03,231 --> 00:55:06,890
but sugar will go into it stores
in the body and it stays in longer.

1802
00:55:06,891 --> 00:55:08,180
Nit eventually turns to fat.

1803
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:12,900
Did you change anything in terms of your
strength and conditioning work or your

1804
00:55:12,901 --> 00:55:13,920
boxing work?

1805
00:55:13,921 --> 00:55:14,520
Like did you,

1806
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,590
did you hire a new boxing trainer?

1807
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,460
Yes.

1808
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,530
I've not got the same
trainer as I did up be fall.

1809
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:20,591
And why did,

1810
00:55:20,591 --> 00:55:21,630
why did you switch things up?

1811
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:23,760
Because it was stale in the gym.

1812
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:25,830
I didn't have no motivation,

1813
00:55:25,831 --> 00:55:26,670
no more pain.

1814
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,170
I have done the same thing for years

1815
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,940
and I didn't have any more
motivation in the gym.

1816
00:55:31,941 --> 00:55:35,940
I that have a new new team and
I knew this going into this,

1817
00:55:35,941 --> 00:55:36,740
um,

1818
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:39,000
[inaudible] come back
till I wanted a new team.

1819
00:55:39,001 --> 00:55:39,960
I wanted to start fresh.

1820
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,130
Give me self some goals.

1821
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:41,870
Give me self.

1822
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:42,691
So a new team,

1823
00:55:42,691 --> 00:55:45,420
more positivity is that of
doing the same stuff day in,

1824
00:55:45,421 --> 00:55:46,254
day out,

1825
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,311
switch off the train.

1826
00:55:47,311 --> 00:55:49,740
I did choice or trainer was very,

1827
00:55:49,741 --> 00:55:51,180
very controversial as well.

1828
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:53,640
Who did you go when I went
with an unknown trainer.

1829
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,200
Hey was 24 years old.

1830
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:56,700
Who'd never trained anybody.

1831
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:57,893
Why'd you do that?

1832
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:00,300
Because I'll tell you the story.

1833
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,820
He was helping out Billy Joe Saunders
where was over Emar Bay as fan of that guy

1834
00:56:04,821 --> 00:56:05,654
like yeah,

1835
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,080
I love that guy too.

1836
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:13,430
And he was helping out Billy Joe and he
was an amateur boxer before Ben in about

1837
00:56:13,861 --> 00:56:15,570
12 fights and he ate Billy Joe.

1838
00:56:15,571 --> 00:56:20,571
He's helping Billy Joel for a few years
and went over to [inaudible] was out in

1839
00:56:21,091 --> 00:56:21,924
a bar.

1840
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:26,140
I was training as time during the 17 I
had two weeks training with Billy Joe

1841
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,273
over in Spain.

1842
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:27,791
He said,

1843
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:29,230
well you come out and
keep me company in Spain.

1844
00:56:29,231 --> 00:56:29,441
I said,

1845
00:56:29,441 --> 00:56:29,880
yeah,

1846
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:30,231
of course.

1847
00:56:30,231 --> 00:56:31,001
And well Mar Bay,

1848
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:31,750
let's go.

1849
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:33,490
I never had any intentions of training.

1850
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,650
I went to over there for a
good drink up and a party.

1851
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:39,630
So gets out that um,

1852
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:40,990
we're all in the coffee shop on the,

1853
00:56:40,991 --> 00:56:44,680
on the part of the noose
and these two stoners,

1854
00:56:44,681 --> 00:56:46,240
we're walking past in Bikini's,

1855
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:48,370
I mean 10 out or 10 each.

1856
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:50,590
And I said to Ben Davison,

1857
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:51,791
I said,

1858
00:56:51,791 --> 00:56:52,930
if you go and get me their numbers,

1859
00:56:52,931 --> 00:56:53,764
Ben,

1860
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,161
I said,

1861
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:55,360
you can be my boxing trainer.

1862
00:56:55,361 --> 00:56:55,631
He went,

1863
00:56:55,631 --> 00:56:56,440
what?

1864
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:56,681
I said,

1865
00:56:56,681 --> 00:56:58,180
you heard me correct the first time.

1866
00:56:58,780 --> 00:56:59,613
So off he went.

1867
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:01,180
After these two,

1868
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:02,680
two good looking girls,

1869
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:05,080
20 minutes goes by,

1870
00:57:05,081 --> 00:57:05,914
he comes back,

1871
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:07,683
no number.

1872
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:09,791
I said,

1873
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:10,240
right.

1874
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:10,511
I said,

1875
00:57:10,511 --> 00:57:11,650
clearly you're not the mom for me.

1876
00:57:11,651 --> 00:57:11,921
I said,

1877
00:57:11,921 --> 00:57:14,470
because the trainer I need I top minerals.

1878
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:17,141
I said,

1879
00:57:17,141 --> 00:57:18,700
and if he can't get a woman's number,

1880
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:19,481
I said,

1881
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:19,631
well,

1882
00:57:19,631 --> 00:57:20,950
you're not clearly can't win fights.

1883
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:21,340
Kenya.

1884
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,173
Simple.

1885
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:22,900
Hey Ma.

1886
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:23,240
Well,

1887
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:26,500
I'll show ya off all in
the mood to misstate.

1888
00:57:26,501 --> 00:57:29,980
It comes by that as a
number bang straight over.

1889
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:31,750
I said excellent motivation.

1890
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:32,643
You hired,

1891
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,950
you hired him because he
got hot girls phone numbers.

1892
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:36,700
Yup.

1893
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:37,533
Hmm.

1894
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,800
I hired him for that reason.

1895
00:57:38,801 --> 00:57:40,870
Not just the hot girls phone numbers.

1896
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:42,010
That wasn't the case.

1897
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:45,880
It was the case that he was willing to
put himself on the line to prove to me

1898
00:57:45,881 --> 00:57:48,250
that he could do something
that takes minerals.

1899
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:52,000
And if you don't have any confidence
then you can't go over to somebody who's

1900
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:52,870
really good looking and say,

1901
00:57:52,871 --> 00:57:53,071
oh,

1902
00:57:53,071 --> 00:57:54,040
on my name's Ben.

1903
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:55,960
And that might make once your number,

1904
00:57:55,961 --> 00:57:56,741
is that possible?

1905
00:57:56,741 --> 00:58:00,310
Like he wouldn't have got the number and
if he didn't have any confidence and he

1906
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:01,630
didn't have any gumption to him,

1907
00:58:01,631 --> 00:58:02,464
wouldn't have got our number.

1908
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:05,890
So I knew he was a good choice because
he was young and fresh and hit a point to

1909
00:58:05,891 --> 00:58:09,520
prove and he wanted to do something
with his life and I give him that

1910
00:58:09,521 --> 00:58:12,610
opportunity and it was the
best decision I ever made.

1911
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,580
Now what about what he knows about boxing?

1912
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:16,900
Obviously that played a factor.

1913
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:20,860
If he's just some random smell who
is good at getting girls numbers?

1914
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:21,161
No,

1915
00:58:21,161 --> 00:58:23,120
it wouldn't be the train
if it was just that way.

1916
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:24,340
The for this,

1917
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,870
he was taking me on the Parkinson's stuff
in between Billy Joe sessions and we

1918
00:58:28,871 --> 00:58:29,920
jelled straight away.

1919
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,240
Me And Ben think alike.

1920
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:35,830
Sometimes you meet people in your life
and you're very similar in personalities

1921
00:58:35,831 --> 00:58:37,360
and we're like the same things.

1922
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,270
We like to do the same thing.

1923
00:58:38,271 --> 00:58:40,450
It's got the same type of personality.

1924
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:43,090
We've just jelled automatically.

1925
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:46,180
Our Gel leaving before I said this
about the number of the girls,

1926
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:48,970
I already knew that I was
going to make Ben Mie trainer.

1927
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:54,230
It got a very keen eye for
boxing and what he does is,

1928
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,113
is very,

1929
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,690
it doesn't look like he knows a
lot about boxing by looking at,

1930
00:58:58,691 --> 00:59:00,790
it just looks like a young
blood could look in fella,

1931
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:05,710
but when you sit down
and analyze the fighters,

1932
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:08,080
a studies boxing day and night,

1933
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:11,680
we'll be out watching movies
after the train bends in his room,

1934
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:13,180
watching Deontay wilder,

1935
00:59:13,181 --> 00:59:13,931
watching the fights,

1936
00:59:13,931 --> 00:59:14,764
watching this and watching.

1937
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,580
He studies the game and he's always coming
up with different game plans and how

1938
00:59:18,581 --> 00:59:20,260
to beat this personnel
to beat that person.

1939
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:21,201
Very,

1940
00:59:21,201 --> 00:59:21,800
very up here.

1941
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,581
He's very knowledgeable.

1942
00:59:22,581 --> 00:59:24,830
Your mother and I said before
even made him my coach.

1943
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:30,230
I said within five years you're going
to be one of the lead in boxing trainers

1944
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:31,064
in the world

1945
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:35,390
and now he's got his chance
and if I beat Deontay Wilder,

1946
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:40,790
Ben Davis and a win ring
magazine trainer of the year 2018

1947
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:41,661
now,

1948
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:44,660
how much different is your training
with him then with your last year?

1949
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:48,870
It's different pay
towards the top trainer.

1950
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:50,760
He got me to be world
heavyweight champion,

1951
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,250
but like I said,

1952
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:55,260
we never had no more
motivation in the gym.

1953
00:59:55,261 --> 00:59:56,094
It was stale.

1954
00:59:56,910 --> 00:59:57,630
There was no,

1955
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:58,920
there was no vibe in the gym.

1956
00:59:58,921 --> 01:00:00,540
It was just like work again,

1957
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:01,543
I didn't want to be there.

1958
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:04,650
How to tie and training camp a few times
I've walked out at the gym every time

1959
01:00:04,651 --> 01:00:06,270
because I didn't want to be in the gym.

1960
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,830
I didn't have no motivation to be there.

1961
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:09,690
So the most,

1962
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:12,450
the main thing is boxing is
boxing name rocket science.

1963
01:00:12,451 --> 01:00:13,650
You can only do a few things.

1964
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,740
I think the most important
things in boxing is road work,

1965
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:17,341
pad work,

1966
01:00:17,341 --> 01:00:19,260
inspiring everything else,

1967
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:20,843
not interested.

1968
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:26,330
My favorite thing to do is spa and I
think what better to do than practice what

1969
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:29,400
you do with another person
fighting other men and that's me.

1970
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:29,801
That's me,

1971
01:00:29,801 --> 01:00:33,090
a her finger and I've often inspired
hundreds arounds for fights to get fit and

1972
01:00:33,091 --> 01:00:33,924
lose weight.

1973
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:35,560
James Tony used to do that too.

1974
01:00:35,561 --> 01:00:40,080
He used to power hundreds AANDRA's rounds
to get self fit and that's what I've

1975
01:00:40,081 --> 01:00:40,914
done it as well.

1976
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:42,780
It gives me a favorite thing,

1977
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:44,700
but now we do a lot of
strong conditioning work.

1978
01:00:44,701 --> 01:00:46,050
We do a lot of weights and stuff.

1979
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:50,490
I figured out over here being around
like American fighters and stuff,

1980
01:00:50,491 --> 01:00:51,510
especially in the boxes,

1981
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:57,050
they don't have that like that that can
that term program of weights and stuff.

1982
01:00:57,901 --> 01:01:00,210
It's more like maybe lightweights,

1983
01:01:00,211 --> 01:01:02,610
loader repetitions as it's
often I'm being heavyweight.

1984
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,050
I lift heavy weight,

1985
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:06,120
very heavy weights and dead lifting,

1986
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:09,510
very heavy weights and bench and heavy
weights and using my body weight and in a

1987
01:01:09,511 --> 01:01:10,344
lot of stuff.

1988
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:11,400
So I believe it's very,

1989
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:13,950
very key factor in being a big strong man.

1990
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:17,410
So he's responsible for that as well.

1991
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:18,251
No,

1992
01:01:18,251 --> 01:01:19,260
I have another guy who does that.

1993
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:20,710
You have another guy that's
strength conditioning one.

1994
01:01:20,711 --> 01:01:21,100
Yeah.

1995
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:26,100
One of the things about a boxing trainer
is knowing when to pull you back,

1996
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:27,670
knowing when you're peaking.

1997
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:32,860
And that mostly comes
from long term success.

1998
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:33,911
Working with many,

1999
01:01:33,911 --> 01:01:34,744
many fighters.

2000
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:38,200
That's gotta be one of the biggest
chances you take with a young guy.

2001
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,231
It is pulled.

2002
01:01:39,231 --> 01:01:40,340
I put him to the test many,

2003
01:01:40,341 --> 01:01:43,130
many times and he does.

2004
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,820
He can say it sometimes
being a successful trainer,

2005
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,320
doing successful things and make
it champions and then you go work.

2006
01:01:51,321 --> 01:01:51,731
We're not trained.

2007
01:01:51,731 --> 01:01:53,060
You think you don't know nothing.

2008
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:54,711
Tough.

2009
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:54,981
Smart.

2010
01:01:54,981 --> 01:01:56,150
I've worked a few trainers and fault.

2011
01:01:56,151 --> 01:01:58,220
I'm not going to go into any names
cause that'd be disrespectful,

2012
01:01:58,850 --> 01:02:02,000
but that knows when I'm feeling good.

2013
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:04,010
My style is all about feelgood factor.

2014
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:05,471
And if I failed,

2015
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:05,780
good,

2016
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:06,291
I'll fight.

2017
01:02:06,291 --> 01:02:07,124
Excellent.

2018
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,570
And if I'm not failing on onto the web,

2019
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:10,160
then I'll fail.

2020
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:10,431
I'll,

2021
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,330
I'll fight rubbish.

2022
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:12,860
Do you know when,

2023
01:02:12,861 --> 01:02:15,330
like when you show up at the gym
and you're feeling like shit,

2024
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:16,670
do you know when to back out of there?

2025
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:18,993
You know,

2026
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:23,010
often have went to the gym not wanting
to be in the gym and felt like shit,

2027
01:02:23,011 --> 01:02:26,460
but they're not the best training
session in middle life does happen many,

2028
01:02:26,461 --> 01:02:29,850
many times until you actually
work it out and get into the,

2029
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:30,690
into the groove.

2030
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:33,060
I don't think you can really know what
you're going to feel like until you start

2031
01:02:33,061 --> 01:02:35,460
training because if he went
on how he felt the falls,

2032
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:38,160
the gym sometimes then you
won't be in the gym at all.

2033
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:42,900
But I do believe what you said is very
correct and it's the most important thing

2034
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,270
that anybody's ever talked about to me.

2035
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:48,480
And I'm glad that you brought it up
because not a lot of people have that

2036
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:51,540
ability to know when to
pull your five to buck.

2037
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,620
And NOFX is enough.

2038
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:56,790
A lot of people think because it's
a bigger fight than your last one.

2039
01:02:56,790 --> 01:02:59,640
You've got to try and double his art
training harder than you've ever trained

2040
01:02:59,641 --> 01:03:00,180
before.

2041
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:01,013
No.

2042
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,160
He run in forever.

2043
01:03:02,161 --> 01:03:02,994
You left him heavier?

2044
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:03,833
No,

2045
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:05,140
because I already trained hard,

2046
01:03:05,141 --> 01:03:08,700
so I don't need to train it
now to where some people think,

2047
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:08,881
right,

2048
01:03:08,881 --> 01:03:09,780
this is wild to fight.

2049
01:03:09,781 --> 01:03:10,920
We need to be fitter than ever.

2050
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:14,160
We need to run up a mountain carrying
a backpack on my back and pull three

2051
01:03:14,161 --> 01:03:15,720
bullet there and wrestle two bears,

2052
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:20,970
but it's not the case on Ben knows
that's not the case is very cautious.

2053
01:03:20,971 --> 01:03:22,170
I've mentioned it to him many,

2054
01:03:22,171 --> 01:03:23,520
many times about overtraining,

2055
01:03:23,521 --> 01:03:24,091
overtraining,

2056
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:24,924
overtraining.

2057
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:27,570
How many times do you see
fighters leave all in the gym?

2058
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:29,123
Quite a bit.

2059
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:30,420
I don't want to leave this in the gym.

2060
01:03:30,421 --> 01:03:31,770
I want to leave it in
the ring on the night.

2061
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:35,700
I'd rather be a little bit on fit,

2062
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,930
a lot on fit rather than
it as an a tiny bit.

2063
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:43,710
Overtrained I've been overtrained
and it's like being on the water.

2064
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:45,090
You've got to go snap.

2065
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,290
You can't put things together.

2066
01:03:46,291 --> 01:03:46,831
You want to,

2067
01:03:46,831 --> 01:03:47,100
you can,

2068
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:47,761
you can see it coming,

2069
01:03:47,761 --> 01:03:48,810
but you can't do nothing about it.

2070
01:03:48,811 --> 01:03:49,870
It's worse than unfit.

2071
01:03:49,990 --> 01:03:50,420
Yeah,

2072
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:51,120
because you're,

2073
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,260
you're compromised.

2074
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:56,760
I've been overtrained before and I've
been totally unfit fat as anything.

2075
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:59,040
I'd rather be unfair 10 times a day.

2076
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:02,940
Then overtrained once cannot do nothing
when you're overtrained but at least

2077
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:03,931
when you were on fit,

2078
01:04:03,931 --> 01:04:04,830
you lose your breath.

2079
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:08,130
But you read your cover when you
arrest and you get back at it again.

2080
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,310
But overtrain you just one page,

2081
01:04:10,311 --> 01:04:11,100
you can't do nothing.

2082
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:12,060
You never get out of the month.

2083
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:12,870
No.

2084
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:15,180
Now you have a strength
and conditioning coach.

2085
01:04:15,181 --> 01:04:16,260
And how often do you do that?

2086
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:19,110
We do that five days a week.

2087
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:19,740
You do?

2088
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:20,250
Wow.

2089
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:21,083
That's quite a bit.

2090
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:22,283
Are you running?

2091
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:22,760
Yeah,

2092
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:23,540
we were on,

2093
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:25,110
we run on three times a week.

2094
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,970
So you're running three times a week.

2095
01:04:26,971 --> 01:04:28,680
Strength and conditioning
five times a week.

2096
01:04:28,681 --> 01:04:29,520
And on top of that,

2097
01:04:29,521 --> 01:04:30,300
all your boxing work?

2098
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:30,620
Yeah,

2099
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:31,950
we box six days a week.

2100
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:33,833
Wow.

2101
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,273
That's a lot of work.

2102
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,313
Yep.

2103
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:37,141
Now you're,

2104
01:04:37,141 --> 01:04:39,450
you're doing dead lifts and bench press.

2105
01:04:39,451 --> 01:04:40,080
And I mean,

2106
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,450
how is this a guy that's worked
with other boxers before?

2107
01:04:42,451 --> 01:04:46,350
I've worked with this guy for three years.

2108
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:48,713
Um,

2109
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:50,730
when I first started working with him,

2110
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:55,340
he worked with boxers before yet a lot
of local boxes and I'm British boxers,

2111
01:04:56,010 --> 01:04:58,890
but he never worked with a heavyweight
weight before and he didn't know what he

2112
01:04:58,891 --> 01:05:02,790
was doing because everyone
makes the same mistake.

2113
01:05:02,791 --> 01:05:04,850
They're only humans will train
a heavyweight labeled train,

2114
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:05,693
the lightweight,

2115
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:08,280
they're not boxing trainers
try for conditioning trainers.

2116
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,220
So he was trying to make it in the
beginning and he was trying to make me do

2117
01:05:11,221 --> 01:05:12,520
something that attendance stone,

2118
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:15,000
145 pound guy was doing,

2119
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:15,960
it's not possible.

2120
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:16,950
It's a different world,

2121
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:20,360
but only through experience
did he realize what,

2122
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:20,570
what,

2123
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:22,210
what we need to do and
what we don't need to do.

2124
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:23,133
And now he's like,

2125
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:24,011
it's perfect.

2126
01:05:24,011 --> 01:05:26,830
I wouldn't change him for the world and
I don't know what I'd do if I didn't

2127
01:05:26,831 --> 01:05:28,630
have him because I'd have to go,

2128
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:29,230
um,

2129
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:29,931
go from wall.

2130
01:05:29,931 --> 01:05:31,480
That same learning process again,

2131
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:36,370
and it's not just heavyweights is
heavyweight boxing because I had,

2132
01:05:36,371 --> 01:05:40,270
this guy is Mr Olympia guy and he
used to train some massive guys,

2133
01:05:40,271 --> 01:05:41,500
350 pounds,

2134
01:05:41,501 --> 01:05:42,334
solid muscle,

2135
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,620
but he didn't know anything about boxing.

2136
01:05:45,030 --> 01:05:47,110
And you box in his performance sport.

2137
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:50,630
And no matter if you look
like an Adonis but you,

2138
01:05:50,631 --> 01:05:52,600
you can't do five rounds is pointless.

2139
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:55,840
I'd rather look fat to
mail to do 12 rounds.

2140
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:56,380
Oh,

2141
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:59,320
he had two more like an Adonis
and be fucked off to five.

2142
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:01,030
No doubt.

2143
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:03,100
I've knocked out plenty
of six bucks in my day.

2144
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:03,963
Don't worry about that.

2145
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:05,380
But um,

2146
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:07,620
I'm still waiting to be
knocked out as a fat pig.

2147
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:10,660
Uh,

2148
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:12,160
training for Deontay wilder.

2149
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:12,780
What have you done

2150
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:13,470
different?

2151
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:13,981
To be honest,

2152
01:06:13,981 --> 01:06:15,180
we haven't done anything different.

2153
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:16,433
Um,

2154
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:17,451
is he the tall?

2155
01:06:17,451 --> 01:06:18,650
As long as guy verified,

2156
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:20,670
I think [inaudible] has same,

2157
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:21,533
same size.

2158
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:23,340
I think glitch come.

2159
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:25,200
I've had longer arms maybe or maybe not,

2160
01:06:25,201 --> 01:06:26,034
I don't know.

2161
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:27,210
But he's up there anyway.

2162
01:06:27,211 --> 01:06:29,700
If he is an ease is the second
tallest I've ever fault.

2163
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:35,610
But every tall guy I've ever
faced to tall the better for me.

2164
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:37,651
I don't know why,

2165
01:06:37,651 --> 01:06:39,780
but I seem to be able to
move better than them.

2166
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,220
The Taller and heavier,

2167
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:45,750
my ideal opponent would be like the tall
has anything and heavy because if they

2168
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:48,720
don't move as quick and the can't
turn Gordon and all on the stiff.

2169
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:51,740
Well what's unusual about you
is that you're a tall guy who's,

2170
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:53,600
who moves like a guy was not tall.

2171
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:54,260
Yeah.

2172
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:59,260
And that most tog eyes have that advantage
of long length and utilization of

2173
01:07:00,081 --> 01:07:00,531
that length.

2174
01:07:00,531 --> 01:07:03,620
They're very good at judging distance
and they have that advantage.

2175
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:08,210
But what you're doing is you're moving
around a lot on top of being tall,

2176
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:10,250
which you could see with Klitschko.

2177
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,950
It was very off putting like right away.

2178
01:07:12,951 --> 01:07:14,960
He didn't know how to
fuck with your timing.

2179
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:16,333
It was,

2180
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:16,591
you know,

2181
01:07:16,591 --> 01:07:16,800
that's,

2182
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,710
that's a giant advantage.

2183
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,030
It is all my life growing up,

2184
01:07:21,031 --> 01:07:24,060
I used to watch all of the great American
heavyweight champions of the world.

2185
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:26,160
We may be in European,

2186
01:07:26,161 --> 01:07:28,710
there's a stigma about European fighters.

2187
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:29,544
The stiff,

2188
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:30,840
the can't move.

2189
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:31,800
They're just strong.

2190
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,173
I agree.

2191
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:36,210
I agree 90% of European fighters,

2192
01:07:36,211 --> 01:07:39,260
a stiff robots just doing a lot of
conditioning work and left a lot of heavy

2193
01:07:39,261 --> 01:07:40,480
weights and they're going,

2194
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:41,550
they're trying to do one thing,

2195
01:07:41,551 --> 01:07:44,760
one to left or right and
take four or five shots back.

2196
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:46,321
I didn't want to do that.

2197
01:07:46,321 --> 01:07:50,760
I wanted to have European conditioning
will American style the best of both

2198
01:07:50,761 --> 01:07:51,594
worlds.

2199
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:52,860
And I believe that's what I've got.

2200
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:56,850
I've got the brashness and the movement
and the speed of an American fighter,

2201
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:59,730
but I've got the European
conditioning and core strength.

2202
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,170
Best of both worlds.

2203
01:08:02,090 --> 01:08:05,030
Now when you think about
a guy like Deontay wilder,

2204
01:08:05,031 --> 01:08:08,480
who's got this wild style and
tries to knock you out with every,

2205
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:09,500
with every punch,

2206
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:15,410
are you doing anything different without
giving away your strategy coming this

2207
01:08:15,411 --> 01:08:15,711
fight?

2208
01:08:15,711 --> 01:08:15,980
Are you

2209
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:20,570
doing anything different in terms of your
preparation or in terms of the way you

2210
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:22,910
shadow box or move or train?

2211
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:23,841
Not really,

2212
01:08:23,841 --> 01:08:24,580
no.

2213
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:25,460
Um,

2214
01:08:28,570 --> 01:08:32,260
how can I explain this
without sounding like a clown

2215
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:34,840
or trying your best?

2216
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:37,960
Don't tie Wilda as a one trick pony.

2217
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:41,080
I don't need to do anything
special to beat him.

2218
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:42,250
I just need to be myself.

2219
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:43,690
Jump Tie.

2220
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:45,790
Wilds is looking for one
right hand all night.

2221
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:47,290
It's a good trick though.

2222
01:08:47,410 --> 01:08:51,180
I said gold trick but we all know what
happens when that trek don't lumped.

2223
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:51,490
Yeah,

2224
01:08:51,490 --> 01:08:52,323
you've lost.

2225
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:54,241
You need mall.

2226
01:08:54,241 --> 01:08:55,300
The one punch to beat me.

2227
01:08:55,301 --> 01:08:57,220
You need to be able to
set you up with footwork,

2228
01:08:57,221 --> 01:08:57,641
spade,

2229
01:08:57,641 --> 01:08:59,260
faints movement and he
doesn't have any of that.

2230
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:03,810
If the Great Klitschko I'd excellent
footwork and ability to set that big punch

2231
01:09:03,811 --> 01:09:04,644
or couldn't do it.

2232
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:07,210
What chances as big
swing a golf day on it.

2233
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,610
If I get hit by a swinging right Tom,

2234
01:09:09,611 --> 01:09:11,710
does it serve donkey now it's my fault.

2235
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:13,330
I want it to knock me out.

2236
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:17,530
If I let wild there swing one of those
wild punches from the back of the hall

2237
01:09:17,531 --> 01:09:18,490
and hit me and knocked me out,

2238
01:09:18,510 --> 01:09:20,380
then I'll say thank you very much.

2239
01:09:20,381 --> 01:09:21,550
You put me out of my misery.

2240
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:27,000
God bless you wilder because obviously I
can't be a great fighter that I think I

2241
01:09:27,711 --> 01:09:27,831
am.

2242
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:29,710
If I'm getting knocked
out by swinging punches,

2243
01:09:30,070 --> 01:09:31,360
it's just not possible.

2244
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:33,310
I don't take big shots anymore.

2245
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:38,311
Years ago from before pre 2013 I used
to take everything dying in the face.

2246
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,040
We'll try and walk through
and use my sheer strength,

2247
01:09:42,041 --> 01:09:43,270
size and aggression.

2248
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:45,820
I'd heart and determination
to get through every event.

2249
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:49,540
But as I stepped up in levels and realized
that wasn't going to get me anywhere,

2250
01:09:49,541 --> 01:09:51,700
but a good idea in a good
punching in the face.

2251
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,880
So I changed me style to box in a moving,

2252
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:56,210
slipping and sliding.

2253
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:59,950
And people have never seen me take any
big shots because I'll just ride them

2254
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:00,640
below.

2255
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,930
Muhammad Ali used to do is
take the shots on the gloves,

2256
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:03,760
go with it.

2257
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:04,870
Slim slide roll.

2258
01:10:05,290 --> 01:10:07,450
Even as powerful as George form on walls.

2259
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:08,770
He was the heavy favorite going in,

2260
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:12,940
knocked out Frazier and Frazier beat
early and you had great fights over 15

2261
01:10:12,941 --> 01:10:13,774
rounds.

2262
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:18,400
It didn't help him in that fight because
he used his greatest asset against him.

2263
01:10:19,030 --> 01:10:20,470
And if I can use Deontay wilder,

2264
01:10:20,471 --> 01:10:21,760
his own power against him,

2265
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:23,103
then I've warm.

2266
01:10:23,410 --> 01:10:24,790
He's looking for one punch.

2267
01:10:24,791 --> 01:10:25,624
I am not.

2268
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:26,523
So there we go.

2269
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:27,221
Well,

2270
01:10:27,221 --> 01:10:29,270
I don't believe if he
can't run that punch,

2271
01:10:29,271 --> 01:10:30,250
she's lost every round.

2272
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:31,840
Even he's a promoter.

2273
01:10:31,841 --> 01:10:33,190
Lou Dibella said recently,

2274
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:34,330
he said,

2275
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:36,490
if he doesn't knock Tyson
down or knock him out,

2276
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:37,660
I don't see how we can win.

2277
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:39,461
Now,

2278
01:10:39,461 --> 01:10:40,990
I don't want you looking past this,

2279
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:45,430
but let's just say you
beat Deontay wilder.

2280
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:46,840
How do you talk?

2281
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:47,950
Joshua went to a fight.

2282
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:51,670
I don't because you can
take a horse to water,

2283
01:10:51,671 --> 01:10:52,780
but you can't make it drink it.

2284
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:54,430
So what do you do after this?

2285
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:55,360
I don't do nothing.

2286
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:56,171
I sit back,

2287
01:10:56,171 --> 01:10:56,621
retire,

2288
01:10:56,621 --> 01:10:58,000
go up to 450 pounds

2289
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:02,960
and get back on the drink area.

2290
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:06,190
What do you do?

2291
01:11:06,191 --> 01:11:06,461
I mean,

2292
01:11:06,461 --> 01:11:07,294
you don't want to,

2293
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:08,890
I don't want to become depressed again.

2294
01:11:08,891 --> 01:11:09,630
You need to go.

2295
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:10,463
Don't want to,

2296
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:11,613
what do you do?

2297
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,180
I just got to keep training,

2298
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:14,850
but like I say,

2299
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:18,250
I only set one goal our time and I don't
care about anything else off of them.

2300
01:11:18,251 --> 01:11:18,991
Beat him wilder.

2301
01:11:18,991 --> 01:11:20,010
And after I beat the wild,

2302
01:11:20,011 --> 01:11:21,670
I probably am going to
be depressed to God.

2303
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:22,220
No,

2304
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:23,053
no,

2305
01:11:23,310 --> 01:11:23,551
no,

2306
01:11:23,551 --> 01:11:23,761
no,

2307
01:11:23,761 --> 01:11:24,031
no.

2308
01:11:24,031 --> 01:11:24,864
Fuck that.

2309
01:11:24,930 --> 01:11:25,830
Get that out of your head.

2310
01:11:25,831 --> 01:11:26,664
Man,

2311
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:27,601
but I don't know.

2312
01:11:27,601 --> 01:11:28,434
You never know.

2313
01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:29,191
You never know.

2314
01:11:29,191 --> 01:11:30,360
But you can stop yourself.

2315
01:11:30,361 --> 01:11:30,481
Look,

2316
01:11:30,481 --> 01:11:31,740
you've already brought yourself back.

2317
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:31,890
Yeah,

2318
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:32,723
I have,

2319
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:34,350
but you never know what's
around the coal on the fear.

2320
01:11:34,351 --> 01:11:36,620
And I don't want to look past Deontay
wilder and thinking about what I'm going

2321
01:11:36,621 --> 01:11:37,440
to do after that.

2322
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:37,950
Right.

2323
01:11:37,950 --> 01:11:38,591
When I won,

2324
01:11:38,591 --> 01:11:39,870
I beat Deontay wilder.

2325
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:41,371
I want to let him fight.

2326
01:11:41,371 --> 01:11:42,204
Joshua.

2327
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,380
He keeps talking about this Joshua fight.

2328
01:11:44,381 --> 01:11:45,390
It's the one he keeps wanting.

2329
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:47,190
So I'm going to let him go fight him.

2330
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:48,090
Go fight each other.

2331
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:49,613
There you go.

2332
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:50,280
There you go.

2333
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:51,180
Take one shoals,

2334
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:52,373
go fight each other.

2335
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:55,230
Come back in a little free is when you
find someone that you think could beat me

2336
01:11:55,231 --> 01:11:55,820
again.

2337
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:56,160
Well,

2338
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,390
if he beats Joshua,

2339
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:59,550
that would be spectacular for a rematch,

2340
01:11:59,551 --> 01:11:59,970
right?

2341
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:00,211
Yeah.

2342
01:12:00,211 --> 01:12:01,680
And if he doesn't beat Joshua,

2343
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:05,400
then it's almost like
Joshua kind of has to fight.

2344
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,290
If he doesn't be Joshua say,

2345
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:07,591
yeah.

2346
01:12:07,591 --> 01:12:09,750
It was about a wilder than theory for,

2347
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,390
he didn't throw any
punches against the area.

2348
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:14,490
Uh,

2349
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:15,181
it is what it is,

2350
01:12:15,181 --> 01:12:15,500
you know,

2351
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:16,140
you know,

2352
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:17,370
you can't please everybody.

2353
01:12:17,371 --> 01:12:19,770
Inboxing and the flight games
have pretty fickle game.

2354
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:22,890
Everybody likes somebody and
don't like the next person.

2355
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:25,223
And you know,

2356
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:26,551
the way I was saying,

2357
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:28,440
I saw Roy Jones say something recently,

2358
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:29,490
I'm on all video.

2359
01:12:29,491 --> 01:12:29,940
It was,

2360
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:30,773
he said,

2361
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:33,620
if Jesus Christ himself wasn't liked,

2362
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,500
what chance have I thought?

2363
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,353
You know what?

2364
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:37,770
That is so true.

2365
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:38,730
Roy.

2366
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:39,660
He's a smart man.

2367
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:40,381
Hundred percent.

2368
01:12:40,381 --> 01:12:41,220
Very smart man.

2369
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:42,960
Very great legendary box.

2370
01:12:42,961 --> 01:12:44,970
One of the greatest of
all times in my opinion.

2371
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:45,770
Yeah.

2372
01:12:45,770 --> 01:12:46,350
Um,

2373
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:48,060
I'm talking when these
people to get them in here,

2374
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:49,050
you need to get him.

2375
01:12:49,051 --> 01:12:50,760
And he's very knowledgeable
on the boxing game.

2376
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,170
Giant fan of that guy.

2377
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:52,620
I was,

2378
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:55,650
I was with a man a couple
of months ago about Russia.

2379
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:57,060
He's a Russian citizen now.

2380
01:12:57,210 --> 01:12:57,570
Yeah.

2381
01:12:57,570 --> 01:12:59,100
How good must that rush pussy be?

2382
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:00,061
Excellent.

2383
01:13:00,061 --> 01:13:01,140
So first so good.

2384
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:02,130
Not that I know.

2385
01:13:02,990 --> 01:13:04,800
It must be so good.

2386
01:13:04,801 --> 01:13:05,634
He got his own,

2387
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:06,720
got a passport.

2388
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:08,700
But listen man,

2389
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:09,090
I'm,

2390
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:10,260
I'm a giant fan of yours.

2391
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,370
It was an honor to meet you.

2392
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:12,151
Have you in here.

2393
01:13:12,151 --> 01:13:13,260
I wish nothing but the best.

2394
01:13:13,261 --> 01:13:15,240
Your story's fantastic and uplifting,

2395
01:13:15,241 --> 01:13:17,820
and please don't go to 450 pounds.

2396
01:13:17,821 --> 01:13:18,480
If you win,

2397
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:19,290
we'll ease.

2398
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:22,800
I might go to 459 pounds of solid
muscle and become Mr Olympia.

2399
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:23,970
Listen,

2400
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:24,610
keep it together.

2401
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:25,810
Thanks for the kind words over.

2402
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:26,210
Yes,

2403
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:27,001
I appreciate it.

2404
01:13:27,001 --> 01:13:27,420
Thank you.

2405
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:27,961
Take it easy.

2406
01:13:27,961 --> 01:13:28,071
Go.

2407
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:28,460
Bless you.
