1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,480
Four,
three,

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,880
two,
one.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:08,650
Hello,
lex.

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,230
Hey,
we're here man.

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,460
What's going on?
We're here.

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,380
Thanks for doing this.
You brought notes.

7
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:18,470
You're seriously prepared when you're 
jumping out of a plane is best to bring 

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,710
a parachute.
This is my parachute.

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,000
I,
I understand.

10
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,060
Yeah.
Um,

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,080
how long have you been working in 
artificial intelligence?

12
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,410
My whole life I think really?
So when I was a kid

13
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:33,410
I wanted to become a psychiatrist.
I wanted to understand the human mind.

14
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,980
I think the human mind is the most 
beautiful mystery that our entire 

15
00:00:42,771 --> 00:00:45,710
civilization is taken on exploring 
through science.

16
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,710
I think you look up at the stars and the
universe out there,

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,590
you know,
the grass Tyson here.

18
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:57,790
It's an amazing,
beautiful scientific journey that we're 

19
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:02,051
taking on and exploring the stars.
But the mind to me is a bigger mystery,

20
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:07,590
more fascinating and it's been the thing
I've been fascinated by from the very 

21
00:01:08,061 --> 00:01:13,061
beginning of my life.
And just I think all of human 

22
00:01:13,061 --> 00:01:13,220
civilization has been wondering,
you know,

23
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:18,221
what is in this inside this thing,
the hundred trillion connections,

24
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:22,040
they're just firing all the time.
Somehow making the magic happen to where

25
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:27,041
you and I can look at each other,
make words all the fear or love life 

26
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:32,621
death that happens is all because of 
this thing in here and understanding why

27
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:38,530
is fascinating and what I early on 
understood is that one of the best ways 

28
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,750
for me at least to understand the human 
mind is to try to build it and that's 

29
00:01:47,871 --> 00:01:51,160
what artificial intelligence is.
You know,

30
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,220
it's,
it's not enough to sort of from a 

31
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,350
psychology perspective,
to study from a psychiatry perspective,

32
00:01:57,351 --> 00:02:02,351
to investigate from the outside.
The best way to understand is to do

33
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,160
so.
You meet almost like reverse engineering

34
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,750
of brain.
There

35
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,360
is some stuff.
Exactly.

36
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:16,361
Reverse engineering the brain.
There's some stuff that you can't 

37
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:18,800
understand until you tried to do it.
You can hypothesize you're.

38
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,630
I mean we're both martial artists from 
various directions.

39
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,620
You can hypothesize about what is the 
best martial art,

40
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:33,430
but until you get in the ring like what 
the UFC did and test ideas is when you 

41
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:40,811
first realize that the touch of death 
that I've seen some youtube videos on,

42
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,890
that you perhaps cannot kill a person 
with a single touch or your mind or 

43
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,430
telepathy,
that there are certain things that work,

44
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,070
wrestling works,
punching works,

45
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,410
okay,
can we make it better?

46
00:02:55,130 --> 00:03:00,130
Can we create something like a touch of 
death?

47
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,360
Can we figure out how to turn the hips,
how to deliver a punch in the way that 

48
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:11,911
does do a significant amount of damage,
and then you at that moment when you 

49
00:03:11,911 --> 00:03:16,471
start to try to do it and you face some 
of the people that are trying to do the 

50
00:03:16,471 --> 00:03:19,891
same thing,
that's the scientific process and you 

51
00:03:19,891 --> 00:03:22,270
try,
you actually begin to understand what is

52
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,320
intelligence and you begin to also 
understand how little we understand.

53
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,530
It's like a Richard Fineman who I'm 
dressed after today.

54
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,110
Are you?
Here's a physicist.

55
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,380
I'm not sure if you're sure.
Yeah,

56
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,510
yeah,
yeah.

57
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:37,100
He always used to wear this exact thing,
so I feel.

58
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,990
I feel pretty bad ass wearing it.
If you think you know astrophysics,

59
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:43,000
you don't know astrophysics.
That's right.

60
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,620
Well,
he said it about quantum physics.

61
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:45,610
Quantum physics.
That's right.

62
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,480
That's right.
Uh,

63
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,440
so he was a quantum physicist and he 
kind of,

64
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:57,130
I remember hear him talk about that 
understanding the nature of the universe

65
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,630
of reality could be like an onion,
we don't know,

66
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,240
but it could be like an onion to where 
you think,

67
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:09,241
you know,
you're studying a layer of an onion and 

68
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:09,241
you peel it away and there's more and 
you keep doing it.

69
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:11,800
And there's an infinite number of layers
with intelligence.

70
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:15,010
There's the same kind of component to 
what we think we know.

71
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,660
We got it.
We figured out,

72
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:19,480
we figured out how to beat the human 
world champion in chess,

73
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,870
we solved intelligence and then we tried
the next thing.

74
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:28,470
Wait a minute,
go is really difficult to solve as a 

75
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:28,470
game.
And then you say,

76
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,570
okay,
I've,

77
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:34,650
I came up when the game of go was 
impossible for artificial intelligence 

78
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,401
systems to be and have now recently had 
been beaten within the last like five 

79
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:38,450
years.
Right?

80
00:04:38,451 --> 00:04:43,451
And the last five years,
there's a lot of technical fascinating 

81
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:45,880
things of why that victory is 
interesting and important for artificial

82
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:47,500
intelligence.
It requires creativity,

83
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:49,930
correct?
It does not.

84
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:55,410
It just exhibits creativity.
So the technical aspects of why Alphago 

85
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,910
from Google deepmind,
that,

86
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,410
that was the designers and the builders 
of the system.

87
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:07,411
That was the victor.
They did a few very interesting 

88
00:05:07,411 --> 00:05:11,251
technical things where essentially you 
develop a neural network.

89
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,110
This is this type of artificial 
intelligence system that looks at a 

90
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,291
board of go as a lot of elements on it 
is black and white pieces and is able to

91
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:28,330
tell you how good is this situation and 
how can I make it better?

92
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,800
And that idea.
So chess players can do this.

93
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:35,800
I'm not actually definitely with the 
game of go second speak.

94
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,150
I'm Russian,
so chest to us as romanticized.

95
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:39,840
It's the beautiful game.
Uh,

96
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,910
I think that there you look at a board 
and all your previous experiences,

97
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,940
all the things you've developed over 
tens of years of practice and thinking 

98
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,650
you get this instinct of what is the 
right path to follow.

99
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,460
And that's exactly what the neural 
network is doing and some of the in

100
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,100
some of the paths it has come up with 
are surprising to other world champions.

101
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,100
So in that sense it says,
well,

102
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:12,101
this thing's exhibiting creativity 
because it's coming up with solutions 

103
00:06:12,101 --> 00:06:14,500
that are something that's outside the 
box.

104
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:16,240
Thinking from the perspective of the 
human,

105
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:21,660
when why,
what do you differentiate between 

106
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:21,660
requires creativity and exhibits 
creativity?

107
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,430
I think one because we don't really 
understand what creativity is and so 

108
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,210
it's almost.

109
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,020
It's on the level of concepts such as 
consciousness.

110
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,080
For example,
the question which there's a lot of 

111
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,201
thinking about whether creating 
something intelligent requires 

112
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:48,621
consciousness requires for us to be 
actual living beings aware of our own 

113
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:53,601
existence in the same way.
Does doing something like building an 

114
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,930
autonomous vehicle,
that's the area where I work in.

115
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,080
Does that require creativity?
Does that even require something like 

116
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,410
consciousness and self awareness?
I mean,

117
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,440
I'm sure in La there's some degree of 
creativity required to navigate traffic 

118
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,990
and in that sense you start to think,
are there solutions that are outside of 

119
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,030
the box and ai system you use to create 
it?

120
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,870
It's once you start to build it,
you realize that to us humans,

121
00:07:21,871 --> 00:07:23,880
certain things appear at creative,
certain things,

122
00:07:23,881 --> 00:07:25,770
dope,
certain things we take for granted,

123
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,830
certain things we find beautiful and 
certain things were like,

124
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:29,250
yeah,
yeah,

125
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:29,760
that's.

126
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,810
Well,
there's creativity in different levels,

127
00:07:31,811 --> 00:07:34,480
right?
These creativity like to write the stand

128
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,600
with Stephen King novel that requires 
creativity.

129
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:41,740
There's something about his.
He's creating these stories.

130
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:47,040
He's giving voices to these characters.
He's developing these scenarios and 

131
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,991
these dramatic sequences in the book 
that's going to get you really sucked 

132
00:07:51,991 --> 00:07:51,991
in.
That's,

133
00:07:51,991 --> 00:07:54,100
that's almost undeniable creativity,
right?

134
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,580
It.
So it's a.

135
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:02,610
he's imagining a world.
What is it always set in a New 

136
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:02,610
Hampshire,
Massachusetts,

137
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,650
Maine,
Maine.

138
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,800
Right?
So he's imagining a world and imagine 

139
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,790
the emotion of different levels 
surrounding that world.

140
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:10,390
Yeah,
that's,

141
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,500
that's creative.
Although if you.

142
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,580
There's a few really good books,
including his own that talks about 

143
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:17,580
writing a.
yeah,

144
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,690
he's got a great book on writing and 
it's actually called on writing.

145
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,770
If there's anyone who can write a book 
on writing.

146
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:27,130
Stephen King,
I think Steven Pressfield,

147
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,410
I hope I'm not saying the war of art and
the Lore of art,

148
00:08:29,411 --> 00:08:34,411
beautiful book,
and I would say if from my recollection 

149
00:08:34,411 --> 00:08:37,300
they don't necessarily talk about 
creativity very much,

150
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,750
that it's really hard work of putting in
the hours of every day of just grinding 

151
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:42,820
it out.
Well,

152
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:47,320
pressfield talks about the muse.
Pressfield speaks of it almost in like a

153
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:49,960
strange,
mystical,

154
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,430
mystical sort of connection to the 
unknown because he,

155
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,650
he almost,

156
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,880
I'm not even exactly sure if he believes
in the muse,

157
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,280
but he,
he,

158
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,510
I think if I could put words in his 
mouth,

159
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,800
I have met him.
He's a great guy.

160
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,830
He was on the podcast once.
I think the way he treats it as if you 

161
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:14,720
decide the muse is real and you show up 
every day and you write as if the Muse 

162
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:21,381
is real.
You get the benefits of the muse being 

163
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:21,381
real.
That's right.

164
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:23,940
Whether or not there's actually a muse 
that's giving you these wonderful ideas

165
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,500
and what is the muse?
So I think of artificial intelligence 

166
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,920
the same way.
There's a quote by a Pamela,

167
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,140
a mccormick from 1979 book that I really
like.

168
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:41,790
Uh,
she talks about the history of 

169
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,511
artificial intelligence.
Ai began with an ancient wish to forge 

170
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:44,750
the gods.
And to me,

171
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:48,110
God's broadly speaking or religions 
represents.

172
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,760
It's kind of like the muse.
It represents the limits of possibility,

173
00:09:52,761 --> 00:09:57,761
the limits of our imagination.
So it's this thing that we don't quite 

174
00:09:57,761 --> 00:09:59,240
understand.
That is the muse,

175
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,360
that is God that's us,
US chimps are very narrow in our ability

176
00:10:06,681 --> 00:10:10,280
to perceive and understand the world.
And there's clearly a much bigger,

177
00:10:10,281 --> 00:10:15,281
beautiful,
mysterious world out there and God or 

178
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:15,890
the Muse represents that world.
And for many people,

179
00:10:15,891 --> 00:10:20,891
I think throughout history and 
especially in in the past set of 100 

180
00:10:20,891 --> 00:10:25,031
years,
artificial intelligence has become to 

181
00:10:25,031 --> 00:10:26,690
represent that a little bit to the thing
which we don't understand.

182
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:31,750
And we crave for both terrified.
And we crave and creating this thing 

183
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,400
that is greater,
that is able to understand the world 

184
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,580
better than us.
And that in that sense,

185
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,940
artificial intelligence is the desire to
create the muse.

186
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,510
This other,
this imaginary thing.

187
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,050
And I think the,
one of the beautiful things,

188
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,990
if you talk about everybody from 
Yamashta,

189
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,490
Sam Harris,
to all the people thinking about this,

190
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,490
is that there is a mix of fear of that,
of,

191
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,560
of that unknown,
of creating that unknown and an 

192
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,101
excitement for it because there's 
something in human nature that desires 

193
00:11:06,101 --> 00:11:07,370
creating that.
Because like I said,

194
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,650
creating is how you understand.

195
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,980
Hm.
Did you initially study biology?

196
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:17,170
Did you study the actual development of 
the mind or what?

197
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,970
What is known about the evolution of the
human mind

198
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:25,770
of the human mind yet?
So my path is different as it's the same

199
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:30,771
for a lot of computer scientists and 
roboticists is we ignore biology,

200
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,820
neuroscience,
the physiology,

201
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:40,821
anatomy of our own bodies,
and there's a lot of beliefs now that 

202
00:11:40,821 --> 00:11:44,280
you should really study biology and 
she's studying neuroscience.

203
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:47,400
You should study your own brain,
the actual chemistry.

204
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:50,490
What's happening?
What is actually how are the neurons are

205
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:55,491
interconnected?
All the different kinds of systems in 

206
00:11:55,491 --> 00:11:55,491
there.
So

207
00:11:55,491 --> 00:11:57,040
that is a little bit of a blind spot or 
it's a big blind spot,

208
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,460
but the problem is.
So I started with more philosophy 

209
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,340
almost,
it's where,

210
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:08,341
um,
if you think Sam Harris has last couple 

211
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:12,871
of years,
it started kind of thinking about 

212
00:12:12,871 --> 00:12:13,840
artificial intelligence and he,
he has a back on your science,

213
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,900
but he's also a philosopher and I 
started there by reading Camu and neat.

214
00:12:17,901 --> 00:12:22,901
You are dusty yefsky thinking what is,
what is intelligence,

215
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,270
what is human morality,
a will.

216
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,600
So all of these concepts give you the 
context for which you can then start 

217
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:37,570
studying these problems.
And then I said there's a,

218
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:42,010
there's a magic that happens when you 
build a robot that drives around.

219
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,660
I mean,
your father.

220
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,360
I'd like to be,
but I'm not yet.

221
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,060
Uh,
there's a creation aspect.

222
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:51,280
That's wonderful.
That's incredible.

223
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,790
It's for me,
I don't have any children at the moment,

224
00:12:55,150 --> 00:13:00,150
but the act of creating a robot where 
you programmed it and it moves around 

225
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,660
and a sense senses the world is,
this is a magical moment.

226
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,500
Did you see Alien Covenant is a Scifi 
Movie?

227
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,910
Yeah.
No

228
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,660
VRC near the alien films.

229
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,010
I,
uh,

230
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:18,310
so I grew up in the Soviet Union where 
we didn't watch too many movies.

231
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,450
So I need to catch up,

232
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,570
we should catch up on that one in 
particular because a lot of it has to do

233
00:13:23,571 --> 00:13:27,170
with artificial intelligence.
There's actually a battle between,

234
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,800
spoiler alert to different but identical
artificially intelligent synthetic 

235
00:13:36,621 --> 00:13:40,850
beings that are there to aid the people 
on the ship.

236
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,840
One of them is very creative and one of 
them is not.

237
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,340
And the one that is not has to save them
from the one that is.

238
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,640
Spoiler alert,
I don't want to tell you who wins,

239
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:53,580
right?
There's,

240
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:58,630
there's a really fascinating scene at 
the very beginning of the movie where 

241
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:04,601
the creator of this artificially 
intelligent being is discussing its 

242
00:14:05,031 --> 00:14:10,031
existence with the being itself and the 
beings trying to figure out who made 

243
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:14,201
him.
And it's this really fascinating moment 

244
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,420
and this being winds up being a bit of a
problem because it possesses creativity 

245
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:24,800
and it has the ability to think for 
itself.

246
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,760
And May,
uh,

247
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:32,300
they found it to be a problem.
So they made a different version of it 

248
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,670
which was not able to create.
And the one that was not able to create 

249
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,391
was much more of more of a servant.
And there's this battle between these 

250
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:44,801
two.
I think you would find it quite 

251
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:44,801
fascinating.
It's a really good movie.

252
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,180
Yeah.
The same kind of theme carries through a

253
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,240
mock in 2001 space odyssey.
Sort of.

254
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,120
You've seen X.
Yep.

255
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,930
I've seen it.
So because of your.

256
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,540
I listened to your podcast and because 
because of it,

257
00:14:56,541 --> 00:15:01,541
I've watched it a second time because 
the first time I watched it and Neil 

258
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,860
degrasse Tyson moment where it was,
you said there's cut,

259
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,670
cut the cut the shit got the shit 
moments for me.

260
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,840
For me,
the movie

261
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,470
winning is everything.
Everything about it was a,

262
00:15:14,471 --> 00:15:19,270
I was rolling my eyes rolling your eyes.
What was the cut the shit moment.

263
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:25,020
So that's a general bad tendency that 
liked to talk about amongst people who 

264
00:15:25,361 --> 00:15:30,361
are scientists that are actually trying 
to do stuff that trying to build the 

265
00:15:30,361 --> 00:15:33,610
thing and it's,
it's very tempting to roll your eyes and

266
00:15:33,611 --> 00:15:37,030
to now in a lot of aspects of artificial
intelligent discussion.

267
00:15:37,031 --> 00:15:38,560
So on.
For me,

268
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,860
there's real reasons to roll your eyes 
and there's just.

269
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:43,960
Well,
let me,

270
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,120
uh,
let me just describe it.

271
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,210
So this person in Mokena,
no spoiler alerts,

272
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,580
uh,
is in the middle,

273
00:15:51,581 --> 00:15:53,800
what,
like a Jurassic Park type situation.

274
00:15:53,801 --> 00:15:56,560
Whereas like in the middle of a land 
that he owns,

275
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,640
yeah,
we don't really know where it is not 

276
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,560
established,
but you have to fly over glaciers and 

277
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:03,560
you get to this place and there's a 
river is.

278
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,751
And he was fantastic compound.
And inside this company appears to be 

279
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:07,850
working alone.
Right?

280
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,980
And he's like lifting

281
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,120
like he's like,
I'm doing curls,

282
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:14,750
I think like dumbbells and a drinking 
heavily.

283
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,880
So the,
everything I know about science,

284
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:23,540
everything I know about engineering is 
it doesn't happen alone.

285
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:28,570
So the situation of a compound with no 
hundreds of engineers they're working on

286
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,870
this is not feasible.
It's not feasible,

287
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:37,871
it's not possible.
And the other moments like that were the

288
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:43,631
technical,
the discussion about how it's 

289
00:16:43,631 --> 00:16:43,900
technically done.
They,

290
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:47,810
they threw a few jargon despite stuff up
and it makes,

291
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,280
it doesn't make any sense.

292
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:54,820
Well that's where I am blissfully 
ignorant.

293
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,130
So I watched it,
I go,

294
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,420
this movie's awesome.
And you're like,

295
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,570
ah,
I know too much.

296
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,820
Not too much,
but that's,

297
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,290
that's a stupid way to think for me.
Uh,

298
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,640
so once you suspend disbelief,
say okay,

299
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:07,520
well,
right.

300
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,700
Those are,
those are not important details.

301
00:17:09,701 --> 00:17:10,810
Yeah,
but it is important.

302
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:15,930
I mean they could have gone to you or 
someone who really has knowledge in it 

303
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,070
and cleaned up those small aspects and 
still kept the,

304
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,080
the theme of the story.
That's right.

305
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,780
They could have,
but they would make a different movie.

306
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:26,680
So that's slightly different.
I don't know if it's possible to make.

307
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:31,681
So you look at 2001 space odyssey.
I don't know if you've seen that movie 

308
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:35,720
with it.
That's the kind of movie you will start 

309
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,131
if you've talked to scientists that 
you'll start making those kinds of 

310
00:17:38,131 --> 00:17:38,290
movies because

311
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,280
you can't actually use jargon that makes
sense because we don't know how to build

312
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:48,281
a lot of these systems.
So the way you need to film it and talk 

313
00:17:48,281 --> 00:17:50,100
about it is with mystery.
Is this hedgehog type

314
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,070
like you almost,
you say very little.

315
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,820
Yeah.
Leave it to your imagination to see what

316
00:17:55,821 --> 00:18:00,821
happens here.
Everything was in the open even in 

317
00:18:00,821 --> 00:18:02,630
winter in terms of the actual 
construction of the brain that when they

318
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:06,860
had that foam looking whatever gel 
brain,

319
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,730
right?
Yeah.

320
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,430
He said if they gave a little bit more

321
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,840
ms Dot suttle mystery,
I think I would have enjoyed that movie 

322
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,511
a lot more.
But the second time really because of 

323
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:18,511
you,
you say,

324
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:18,511
I think it's your favorite Scifi.

325
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,490
It's absolutely one of my favorite side,
one of my favorite movies,

326
00:18:22,491 --> 00:18:23,690
period.
I loved it.

327
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,140
Yeah.

328
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:24,930
So I,
I,

329
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:30,090
I,
I watched it again and also Sam Harris 

330
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,650
said that he also hated the movie and 
then washed again and liked it.

331
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,980
So I gave it.
I gave it a chance.

332
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,500
Why would you see a movie again after 
you hate it?

333
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:44,850
Uh,
because maybe you're self aware enough 

334
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,020
to think there's something unhealthy 
about the way I hated the movie.

335
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,650
Like you're like introspective enough to
know.

336
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,070
It's like I have the same experience 
with Batman.

337
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,650
Okay.
I watched a which one?

338
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,830
Dark night?
I think it was Christian Bale,

339
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,740
Christian Bale.
And so to me,

340
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:06,400
the first time I watched that is a guy 
in a costume,

341
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:10,750
like speaking excessively with 
excessively low voice.

342
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,750
I mean it was just something with like 
little bunny ears,

343
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,610
not bunny ears,
but the ears.

344
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,090
It's so silly.
But then you can go back and okay,

345
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:24,510
if we just accepted those,
that's the reality of the world we live 

346
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,830
in now.
What's the human nature aspects that are

347
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:28,540
being explored here?
What is the,

348
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:34,490
the beautiful conflict between good and 
evil as being explored here and what are

349
00:19:35,051 --> 00:19:39,170
the awesome graphics effects that are 
being on exhibit.

350
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,640
Right?
So if you could just suspend that,

351
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:47,590
that's beautiful.
The movie can become quite fun to watch,

352
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,070
but still to me,
not to offend anybody,

353
00:19:51,071 --> 00:19:54,010
but a bad superhero.
Movies are difficult.

354
00:19:54,011 --> 00:19:56,170
It's still difficult for me to watch.
Yeah.

355
00:19:56,171 --> 00:20:00,610
Who was talking about that recently?
Was it Kelly?

356
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,430
Kelly slater?
No,

357
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,570
that was yesterday.
Yesterday.

358
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:05,520
Kyle.
He's kind of a guy.

359
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,190
He doesn't look super hero movies or 
something.

360
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,140
He doesn't like superhero movies.
We're talking about Batman,

361
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,420
about Christian Bale's voice.
And he's like,

362
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:14,940
the most ridiculous thing was that he's 
actually Batman.

363
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:19,941
Not those voice on Batman,
that part of it is way less ridiculous 

364
00:20:22,411 --> 00:20:25,620
than the fact that he's Batman is Batman
because anybody could do that voice.

365
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,590
Yeah.
So,

366
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,800
but I contradict.
Um,

367
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:34,850
I'm,
I'm a hypocrite because game of thrones 

368
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,830
or Tolkien's,
Lord of the Rings,

369
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,200
I'm gonna tow.
It's totally believable to me.

370
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,040
Yeah,
of course.

371
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,580
Dragons and.
Well that's a fantasy world,

372
00:20:44,581 --> 00:20:49,581
right?
That's the problem with something like 

373
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:49,990
Batman or even Mokena is that it takes 
place in this world.

374
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,920
Whereas they're in middle earth are in a
place that doesn't exist.

375
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,490
And if you.
It's like if you like Avatar,

376
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,820
if you make a movie about a place that 
does not exist,

377
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,380
you can have all kinds of crazy shit in 
that movie because it's not real.

378
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,510
That's right.
Yeah.

379
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:11,380
So,
but at the same time,

380
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,850
like star wars,
it's harder for me.

381
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:16,240
And you're saying star wars is a little 
more real because it's,

382
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:21,540
it's feels feasible.
Like he could have spaceships flying 

383
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:21,540
around.
Right?

384
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,620
What,
what's not feasible about star wars to.

385
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,670
Oh,
I'm not.

386
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,620
I'll leave that one to the other 
undergrad size.

387
00:21:26,621 --> 00:21:28,990
He was getting angry about the robot.
That's circular.

388
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:32,280
Whatever rolls around.
He's like slippery.

389
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,520
Yeah,
like trying to roll around all over the 

390
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:37,520
sand.
It wouldn't work.

391
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:37,520
It would get no traction.
I was like,

392
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,121
that's true.
But if you had like glass tires and he 

393
00:21:42,121 --> 00:21:42,600
tried to drive over sand,
it was smooth.

394
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,130
You'd get nothing.
Yeah.

395
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:49,530
Is,
he's actually the guy that made me 

396
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,631
realize,
you know the movie ghost with Patrick 

397
00:21:51,631 --> 00:21:51,631
swayze and it was at this pockets or 
somewhere.

398
00:21:51,631 --> 00:21:52,990
He was talking about the fact that.

399
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,830
So this guy could go through the walls.
Right.

400
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,880
It's a beautiful romantic movie that 
everybody should watch.

401
00:22:00,881 --> 00:22:05,881
Right.
But he doesn't seem to fall through 

402
00:22:05,881 --> 00:22:07,080
chairs when he sits on them,
right?

403
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:11,140
Say he can walk through walls,
but he can put his hand on the desk.

404
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,240
You can sit like his.
His blood has a magical shield that is 

405
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,480
in this reality.
This is a quantum shield that protects 

406
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:21,740
them from falling.
So.

407
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,970
So that's,
you know,

408
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,980
those devices.
Unnecessary movies.

409
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:28,630
I get it in.
Yeah.

410
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:33,631
But you got a good point.
He's got a good point to just cut the 

411
00:22:33,631 --> 00:22:34,750
shit moments.
They don't have to be there.

412
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:40,050
You know,
you just have to work them out in 

413
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,461
advance,
but the problem is a lot of movie 

414
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:41,461
producers think that they're smarter 
than people.

415
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:42,940
They just decided on,
just put it in there.

416
00:22:42,941 --> 00:22:44,200
The average person is not going to care.

417
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,200
I've had that conversation with movie 
producers about martial arts and I was 

418
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,200
like,
well,

419
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,140
this is just nonsense.
You can't do that.

420
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,890
Like because I was explaining martial 
arts to someone and he was like,

421
00:22:53,891 --> 00:22:55,540
ah,
the average person's not going to care.

422
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,140
I'm like,
oh,

423
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,820
the average person.
Okay,

424
00:22:57,821 --> 00:23:02,821
well you brought me in as a martial arts
expert to talk to you about your movie 

425
00:23:02,821 --> 00:23:02,890
and I'm telling you right now.
This is horseshit.

426
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,850
Yeah.
I'm a huge believer,

427
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,960
Steve jobs philosophy where forget the 
average person discussion because first 

428
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,450
of all,
the average person will care.

429
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:19,470
A steve jobs designed with really push 
the design of the interior of computers 

430
00:23:20,531 --> 00:23:23,140
to be beautiful,
not just the exterior.

431
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,200
Even if you never see it,
if you have attention to detail,

432
00:23:26,201 --> 00:23:31,201
to every aspect of the design,
even if it's completely hidden from the 

433
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,970
actual user in the end,
somehow that Karma,

434
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:38,971
whatever it is that like love for 
everything you do and that loves seeps 

435
00:23:38,971 --> 00:23:40,480
through the product.
And the same.

436
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:43,840
I think with movies,
if you talk about space,

437
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,250
the 2001 odyssey,
there's

438
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,920
so many details.
I think there's probably these groups of

439
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:51,250
people that study every detail of that 
movie and other,

440
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,180
um,
cooper films,

441
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:58,930
those little details matter.
Somehow they all come together to show 

442
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:03,050
how deeply passionate you are about 
telling the story.

443
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,590
Well,
Kubrick was a perfect example,

444
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:09,610
right?
Because he would put layer upon layer 

445
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:09,610
upon layer of detail and the films that 
people would never even recognize.

446
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,760
Like there's a bunch of correlations 
between the Apollo Moon landings and the

447
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:15,620
shining.
You know,

448
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:18,650
there's like people have actually 
studied it to the point where they think

449
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:23,651
that it's some sort of a confession that
Kubrick faked the moon landing because 

450
00:24:23,651 --> 00:24:27,690
it goes from the little boy having the 
rocket ship on his sweater to the,

451
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:32,460
the number of the number of the room 
that things happened.

452
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:37,470
There's like a bunch of very bizarre 
connections in the film that Kubrick and

453
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:42,860
questionably engineered because he was 
just a stupid,

454
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:44,120
smart man.
I mean,

455
00:24:44,121 --> 00:24:48,290
he was so goddamn smart that he would do
complex mathematics for fun.

456
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:53,291
No spare time.
Kubrick was a legitimate genius and he 

457
00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:00,190
engineered that sort of complexity into 
his films where he didn't have cut the 

458
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,310
shit moments in his movies.
Not that I can recall.

459
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,920
No,
not even close.

460
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,660
This is very interesting.
I mean,

461
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:10,661
but that probably speaks to the reality 
of Hollywood today that the cut the shit

462
00:25:12,351 --> 00:25:15,320
moments don't affect the bottom line of 
how much the movie makes.

463
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,210
Well,
it really depends on them film,

464
00:25:17,211 --> 00:25:18,080
right?
I mean,

465
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:22,520
the cut the shit moments that Neil 
degrasse Tyson found in gravity I didn't

466
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:27,521
see because I wasn't aware of what the 
effects of gravity on a person's hair 

467
00:25:27,521 --> 00:25:28,130
would be.
You know,

468
00:25:28,131 --> 00:25:30,590
he saw it and he was like,
this is ridiculous.

469
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:35,830
And then there were some things like,
why are these space station so close 

470
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:39,011
together?
I just let it slide while the movie was 

471
00:25:39,011 --> 00:25:39,011
playing,
but then he went into great detail about

472
00:25:39,011 --> 00:25:43,691
how preposterous it would be.
Those base stations were that close 

473
00:25:43,691 --> 00:25:43,691
together.
You get to them so quickly.

474
00:25:43,691 --> 00:25:47,070
That's where the Sandra bullock and good
looking guy and George Clooney.

475
00:25:47,071 --> 00:25:47,760
George Clooney.
Yeah.

476
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,840
Good looking guy.
So that.

477
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,510
Did that pass muster with that movie?
No,

478
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,750
he tore it apart and when he tore it 
apart,

479
00:25:56,751 --> 00:25:58,520
people went crazy.
They get so angry at him.

480
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,790
Yeah.
He reads the negative comments.

481
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:09,110
I actually recently,
because of doing a lot of work with 

482
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,770
artificial intelligence and lecturing 
about and so on,

483
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:15,270
have plugged into this community of 
folks that are thinking about the future

484
00:26:15,271 --> 00:26:18,300
of artificial intelligence,
artificial general intelligence,

485
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:23,280
and they are very much out of the box 
thinkers to where the kind of messages I

486
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,980
get are our best.
So I let it.

487
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:31,660
I let them kind of explore those ideas 
without sort of engaging to those 

488
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:31,800
discussions.
I think

489
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,210
very complex discussion should be had 
with people in person.

490
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:40,690
That's what I think.
And I think that when you allow 

491
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:44,140
comments,
just random anonymous comments to enter 

492
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,610
into your consciousness like you were 
taking risks and you may,

493
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:52,530
you may run into a bunch of really 
brilliant ideas that are,

494
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,880
um,
you know,

495
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:58,910
coming from people that are considerate 
of thought these things through or you 

496
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:02,550
might just run into a river of assholes 
and it's entirely possible.

497
00:27:02,551 --> 00:27:05,880
And I peeked into my comments today on 
twitter.

498
00:27:05,881 --> 00:27:07,200
I was like,
what in the fuck?

499
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,250
I started reading a couple of them,
some just morons and I'm like,

500
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:12,540
all right,
what about some shit?

501
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:14,160
I didn't even know what the fuck they 
were talking about,

502
00:27:14,161 --> 00:27:19,161
but,
but that's the risk you take when you 

503
00:27:19,161 --> 00:27:21,891
dive in.
You're going to get people that are 

504
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:23,451
disproportionately upset.
You're going to get people that are 

505
00:27:23,451 --> 00:27:23,850
disproportionately,
you know,

506
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:28,910
delusional or whatever it is in regards 
to your position on something or whether

507
00:27:29,461 --> 00:27:31,560
or not they even understand your 
position.

508
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:36,620
They'll argue something that's an 
incorrect interpretation of your 

509
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:36,620
position.

510
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,790
Yeah,
and you've actually,

511
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:42,080
from what I've heard,
you've actually been to this podcast and

512
00:27:42,081 --> 00:27:47,081
so on,
really good at being open minded and 

513
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:49,911
it's something I try to preach as well.
So in ai discussions when you're talking

514
00:27:50,601 --> 00:27:55,601
about Agi and talking about,
so there's a difference between narrow 

515
00:27:55,601 --> 00:27:57,340
ai and general artificial intelligence,
narrow ais,

516
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:02,650
the kinds of things that are the kind of
tools that are being applied now and 

517
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:07,361
being quite effective.
And then there's general ai which is a 

518
00:28:07,361 --> 00:28:10,451
broad categorization of concepts that 
are human level or super human level 

519
00:28:10,451 --> 00:28:12,500
intelligence.
And when you talk about Agi,

520
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,340
artificial general intelligence,
there's seems to be two camps of people,

521
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:21,410
ones who are really working deep in it.
Like that's the camp.

522
00:28:21,411 --> 00:28:26,411
I kind of sit in and a lot of those 
folks tend to roll their eyes and just 

523
00:28:26,411 --> 00:28:28,250
not engage in any discussion of the 
future.

524
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:33,610
The idea is saying it's really hard to 
do what we're doing and it's just really

525
00:28:35,211 --> 00:28:38,060
hard to see how this becomes 
intelligent.

526
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:41,180
And then there's another group of people
who say,

527
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:46,930
yeah,
but you're being very shortsighted that 

528
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,010
you may not be able to do much now,
but the exponential,

529
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,650
the hard takeoff overnight,
it can become super intelligent and then

530
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:58,850
it'll be too late to think about.
Now the problem with those two camps,

531
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:01,160
as with any camps,
democratic republic,

532
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:03,970
any camps,
is they don't seem to be,

533
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:09,010
seem to be talking past each other as 
opposed to both have really interesting 

534
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:13,421
ideas.
If you go back to the analogy of a touch

535
00:29:13,431 --> 00:29:17,630
of death,
a of this idea of MMA,

536
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,000
right?
So I'm the,

537
00:29:19,001 --> 00:29:21,590
in this analogy,
I'm going to put myself in the UFC for a

538
00:29:21,591 --> 00:29:22,910
second.
Uh,

539
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,110
in this analogy,
I'm,

540
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,570
you know,
like ranked in the top 20.

541
00:29:26,571 --> 00:29:29,210
I'm working really hard.
My dream is to become a world champion.

542
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,790
I'm training three times a day.
I'm really working,

543
00:29:31,791 --> 00:29:36,791
I'm an engineer,
I'm trying to build my skills up and 

544
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:39,521
then there's other folks that come along
like Steven Seagal and so on that kind 

545
00:29:39,521 --> 00:29:44,441
of talk about other of martial arts or 
other ideas of how you can do certain 

546
00:29:44,441 --> 00:29:49,141
things and I think,
I think Steven Seagal and could isn't 

547
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:55,080
mine beyond to something.
I think we really need to be open 

548
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,080
minded,
like a intro to civil.

549
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,070
I think toxicity or somebody talks as 
well,

550
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:58,650
right?

551
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:04,380
Well,
Anderson Silva thinks Steven Seagal is.

552
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:11,430
I want to put this in a respectful way.
He understood so it has a wonderful 

553
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:16,411
sense of humor and Anderson Silva is 
very playful and he thought it would be 

554
00:30:17,681 --> 00:30:22,681
hilarious if people believe that he was 
learning all of his martial arts from 

555
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,250
statistics to go.
Got It.

556
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:29,280
He also loves Steven Seagal movies 
legitimately so treated him with a great

557
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:34,471
deal of respect.
He also recognizes that Steven Seagal 

558
00:30:34,471 --> 00:30:37,980
actually is a master of Ikea,
though he really does understand the 

559
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,881
Quito and was one of the very first 
westerners that was teaching in Japan,

560
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,240
speaks fluent Japanese,
was teaching at a Dojo in Japan and is,

561
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:52,210
you know,
a legitimate master by Quito.

562
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:56,050
Right.
The problem with that Quito is it's,

563
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,420
it's one of those martial arts that has 
merit in a,

564
00:31:01,421 --> 00:31:03,090
in a vacuum.
They,

565
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:08,110
if you,
if you're in a world where there's no 

566
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:11,160
ncaa wrestlers or know judo players or 
no Brazilian Jujitsu,

567
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:15,340
black belts or no,
a Moitai kickboxers,

568
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,830
there might be something to that Ikea 
stuff,

569
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:23,220
but in the world we're,
all those other martial arts exist and 

570
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,630
we've examined all the intricacies of 
hand to hand combat.

571
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,120
It falls horribly short.

572
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,040
Let's see.
This is the point I'm trying to make.

573
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:34,930
You just said that we've investigated 
all the intricacies.

574
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,080
You said all the intricacies of hand to 
hand combat.

575
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,520
I mean,
you're just speaking,

576
00:31:39,521 --> 00:31:44,521
but you want to open your mind to the 
possibility that I kito has,

577
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,360
uh,
some techniques that are effective that 

578
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:50,360
are affected.

579
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:50,360
Yeah.
When I say all you're,

580
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,300
you're correct.
That's not a correct way of describing 

581
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,020
it because there's always new moves that
are being like,

582
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,790
for instance,
I'm in this recent fight between Anthony

583
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:05,790
Pettis and Tony Ferguson.
Tony Ferguson actually used wing Chung 

584
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,210
in a fight.
He,

585
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:10,810
he trapped one of Anthony Pettis his 
hands and hit him with an elbow.

586
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,160
He basically used a technique that you 
would use on a wing Chung dummy,

587
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:20,340
and he did it in an actual world class,
mixed martial arts fight and I remember 

588
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,090
watching it.
Wow,

589
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,090
go on this crazy motherfucker actually 
pulled that off because that's.

590
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,720
It's a technique that you just rarely 
see anybody getting that proficient at 

591
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,371
it that,
that fights in mma and Ferguson is 

592
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:39,380
extremely creative and open minded guy 
and he figured out a way to make that 

593
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,820
work in a world class fight.
So.

594
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,620
And let me then ask you the question 
there.

595
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,700
There's these people who still believe 
in quite a lot of them that there is 

596
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:49,740
this touch of death.
Right.

597
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,720
Do you.
So do you think it's possible to 

598
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,571
discover through this rigorous 
scientific process that is mma that 

599
00:32:58,571 --> 00:33:00,650
started pretty recently,
do you think,

600
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:05,680
not the touch of death,
but do you think we can get a 10 x 

601
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:05,680
improvement in the amount of power the 
human body can,

602
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,720
can generate in,
in,

603
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,060
and punching?
No,

604
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,550
no,
certainly not.

605
00:33:10,551 --> 00:33:15,551
10 acts.
I think you can get incremental 

606
00:33:15,551 --> 00:33:17,711
improvements,
but it's all based entirely on your 

607
00:33:17,711 --> 00:33:20,201
frame.
Like if you're a person that has very 

608
00:33:20,201 --> 00:33:21,020
small hands and narrow shoulders,
you're kind of screwed.

609
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,240
There's not really a lot of room for 
improvement.

610
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:28,270
You can,
you can certainly get incremental 

611
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:28,270
improvement and your ability to generate
power,

612
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:33,580
but you'll never be able to generate the
same kind of power as say a guy with a 

613
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:38,351
very big frame like a brock lesnar or 
Derrick Lewis or um,

614
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,430
you know,
anyone who has.

615
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:45,910
There's like classic elements that go 
with being able to generate large 

616
00:33:47,211 --> 00:33:50,810
amounts of power wide shoulders,
large hands.

617
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:55,930
There's,
there's a lot of characteristics of the 

618
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:55,930
human frame itself.
Um,

619
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:58,760
those,
even those people,

620
00:33:58,761 --> 00:34:03,761
there's only so much power you can 
generate and we pretty much know how to 

621
00:34:03,761 --> 00:34:03,761
do that correctly.

622
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:09,360
So the way you're talking about as a 
martial arts expert now is kind of the 

623
00:34:09,491 --> 00:34:14,491
way a lot of the experts in robotics and
ai talk about ai and when the topic of 

624
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:19,210
touch of death is brought up,
now the analogy is not perfect.

625
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,380
I tend to use probably too many 
analogies is

626
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:26,910
we maybe know the human body butter that
we know the possibility of Ai,

627
00:34:26,911 --> 00:34:27,960
I would assume so,
right?

628
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:31,020
He has the possibility of ai is 
basically limitless.

629
00:34:31,021 --> 00:34:34,200
Once ai starts redesigning itself,

630
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:39,570
it's not obvious that that's true.
Our imagination allows it to be true.

631
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,130
When I,
I'm of two minds,

632
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,130
I am,
I,

633
00:34:44,131 --> 00:34:45,100
I'm,
I'm both,

634
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:47,800
I can hold both beliefs that are 
contradictory in my mind.

635
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:52,570
One is that idea is really far away,
almost bordering and bs.

636
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:57,630
And the other is it can be there 
overnight and I think you can believe 

637
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:57,630
both of those things.
So,

638
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,800
um,
there's another,

639
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:05,340
a quote from Barbara wouldn't,
it's a poem I've heard on a,

640
00:35:06,701 --> 00:35:11,701
on a,
on a lecture somewhere that I really 

641
00:35:11,701 --> 00:35:11,701
like,
which is,

642
00:35:11,701 --> 00:35:15,010
it's from the champions of the 
impossible rather than the slaves at the

643
00:35:15,011 --> 00:35:17,680
possible,
that evolution draws his creative force.

644
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:22,810
So I see a mosque as a representative of
the champion of the impossible.

645
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,680
I see exponential growth of ai within 
the next several decades as the 

646
00:35:28,901 --> 00:35:31,690
impossible,
but it's the champions of the impossible

647
00:35:31,691 --> 00:35:33,850
that actually make the impossible 
happen.

648
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:35,200
Why would a

649
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,400
exponential growth of AI impossible?
Because that seems inevitable to me.

650
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:45,550
So it's not impossible and I'm sort of 
using the word impossible.

651
00:35:45,551 --> 00:35:47,710
Meaning magnificent.
The,

652
00:35:47,711 --> 00:35:49,420
yeah,
it feels very difficult.

653
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,800
Very,
very difficult.

654
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,060
We don't even know where to begin brand 
yet.

655
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:59,130
Like the touch of death actually feels.
I would see the touch of death is 

656
00:35:59,130 --> 00:35:59,530
horseshit,
but see you're an expert.

657
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,560
Ah,
and they touch you in the chest,

658
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,420
but we don't have the ability in the 
body to generate

659
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:06,010
that kind of energy.
How do you know that?

660
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,340
That's a good question.
Um,

661
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:11,680
it's never been done.
We understand study notes.

662
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,590
Never Been,
how do you know it's never been done.

663
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:17,290
There could be someone out there with 
magic that I.

664
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:19,960
That has escaped my grasp.
I know you've studied,

665
00:36:19,961 --> 00:36:24,961
you've talked about with a Graham 
Hancock and you've talked about the 

666
00:36:24,961 --> 00:36:26,740
history.
Maybe it was in Roman times.

667
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,800
There was that idea was discovered and 
then it was lost because weapons and 

668
00:36:32,051 --> 00:36:34,910
much more effective ways of,
uh,

669
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,920
of delivering damage.
Now I find myself in a very 

670
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,290
uncomfortable position of defending the 
concept as a martial artist,

671
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,680
a defining the concept of martial arts.
Did you study a Jujitsu and judo and 

672
00:36:48,011 --> 00:36:48,920
wrestling,
wrestling

673
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,890
the hard ones?
Jitsu,

674
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,920
judo and wrestling.
Those are absolute martial arts in my 

675
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,080
opinion.
This is what I mean.

676
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,440
Like if you are a guy who just has a 
fantastic physique and incredible speed 

677
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:08,770
and ridiculous power,
just you just congergate ridiculous 

678
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,370
power.
If you just are just a per,

679
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,170
you know who deontay wilder is?

680
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,710
Yes.
He would champion the world boxer.

681
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,050
He's a fee.
You have,

682
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,150
what's his name?
Tyson fury on tomorrow.

683
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,530
Two undefeated guys,
right?

684
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:20,930
Yes.

685
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:26,470
Deontay wilder has fantastic power.
I mean,

686
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:29,120
he just knocks people flying across the 
ring.

687
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,640
He's just,
I think deontay wilder,

688
00:37:31,641 --> 00:37:36,641
if he just came off the street,
if he was 25 years old and no one ever 

689
00:37:36,641 --> 00:37:40,721
taught them how to box it all and you 
just wrapped his hands up and had him 

690
00:37:40,721 --> 00:37:45,401
hit a bag,
he would be able to generate insane 

691
00:37:45,401 --> 00:37:45,401
amounts of force.
Now,

692
00:37:45,401 --> 00:37:49,811
if you're a person that really didn't 
have much power and you had a box with 

693
00:37:49,811 --> 00:37:53,711
deontay wilder and you were both the 
same age and you are a person that knew 

694
00:37:53,711 --> 00:37:55,160
boxing and you stood in front of 
Deontae,

695
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:00,400
it's entirely possible that deontay 
wilder could knock you into another 

696
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,731
dimension,
even though he had no experience in 

697
00:38:03,731 --> 00:38:06,641
boxing.
If he just held on you and hit you with 

698
00:38:06,641 --> 00:38:06,641
a haymaker,
he might be able to put you out.

699
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:10,430
If you're a person who is,
let's say,

700
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:14,930
built like you and a guy who exercises 
who strong,

701
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:20,200
and then there's someone who's 
identically built like you who's a black

702
00:38:20,241 --> 00:38:25,241
belt in Brazilian Jujitsu and you don't 
have any experience in martial arts at 

703
00:38:25,241 --> 00:38:27,500
all,
your fucked right?

704
00:38:27,501 --> 00:38:32,501
Yes.
If you're a person who's built like you 

705
00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:35,650
who's a,
a guy who exercises and is healthy and 

706
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:38,260
you grapple with the guy who was even 
stronger than you and bigger than you,

707
00:38:38,261 --> 00:38:40,330
but he has no experience in Brazilian 
Jujitsu,

708
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:43,810
he's still fucked.
That's the difference.

709
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:48,840
That's why I think Brazilian Jujitsu and
judo and wrestling and particularly 

710
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,561
those are absolutes in that you have 
control of the body and once you grab a 

711
00:38:52,801 --> 00:38:57,801
hold of a person's body,
there's no lucky triangle chokes in 

712
00:38:58,241 --> 00:38:59,290
Jujitsu.
That's right.

713
00:38:59,450 --> 00:38:59,680
Right.

714
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,500
I think,
uh,

715
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,960
I think I would say Jujitsu as the 
highest representative of that.

716
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:10,170
I think in wrestling and judo,
having practiced those,

717
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,590
I've never been quite as humble and as I
have been in Jujitsu.

718
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,660
Yeah.
Especially when I started,

719
00:39:15,661 --> 00:39:17,610
I was power lifting.
I was like,

720
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:22,640
I was a total meathead and you know,
a 130 pound guy or girl could tap you 

721
00:39:23,701 --> 00:39:24,570
easily.
Yeah.

722
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:27,420
It's confusing.
It's very confusing in wrestling,

723
00:39:27,421 --> 00:39:32,421
you can get pretty far with that.
Had power in judo,

724
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:37,770
a little bit less so at its highest 
levels at if you go to Japan,

725
00:39:37,771 --> 00:39:39,690
for example,
where they,

726
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:44,940
I mean the whole dream of judo is 
effortlessly throw your opponent,

727
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,710
but in,
you know,

728
00:39:46,711 --> 00:39:51,711
if you go to gyms in America and so on,
you know,

729
00:39:51,721 --> 00:39:56,721
there is some hard wrestling style 
gripping and just beating each other up 

730
00:39:56,721 --> 00:40:01,400
pretty intensely where we're not talking
about beautiful tomatoes are these 

731
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,080
beautiful throws were talking about some
scrapping some,

732
00:40:04,081 --> 00:40:05,700
uh,
some wrestling style.

733
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,700
Yeah.
Yeah.

734
00:40:06,701 --> 00:40:07,630
No,
I see what you're saying.

735
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,680
Yeah.
Um,

736
00:40:08,681 --> 00:40:12,850
my experience with Jujitsu was very 
humbling when I first started out.

737
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:17,910
I was a,
had a long background in martial arts 

738
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:21,241
and striking and uh,
even wrestled in high school and then I 

739
00:40:21,241 --> 00:40:25,260
started taking Jujitsu and a guy who was
my size and I was young at the time and 

740
00:40:25,421 --> 00:40:28,690
he was basically close to my age,
just mauled me.

741
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,140
And he wasn't even a black belt.
I think he was a purple belt.

742
00:40:32,141 --> 00:40:33,850
He might've been a blue belt.
I think it was a purple belt.

743
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:36,490
Um,
and it just destroyed me.

744
00:40:36,491 --> 00:40:38,560
Just did anything he wanted to be choked
me,

745
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,290
arm barred me just and I remember 
thinking,

746
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:43,840
man,
I am so delusional.

747
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:48,841
I thought I had a chance.
I thought just based on taking a couple 

748
00:40:49,181 --> 00:40:54,181
classes and learning what an Armbar is 
and then being a strong person who has a

749
00:40:54,461 --> 00:40:59,461
background in martial arts that I would 
be able to at least hold him off a 

750
00:40:59,461 --> 00:40:59,461
little bit.

751
00:40:59,461 --> 00:41:01,440
No,
and this is a uh,

752
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:06,830
that's so beautiful that I feel lucky to
have that had that experience of having 

753
00:41:07,711 --> 00:41:09,900
my ass kicked.
And Philadelphia is where I came up with

754
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:14,400
because in science you don't often get 
that experience in the space of ideas.

755
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,890
You can't,
uh,

756
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:21,891
you can't choke each other out.
You can't beat each other up and 

757
00:41:21,891 --> 00:41:22,980
science.
And so it's easy to go your whole life.

758
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,670
I have so many people around me telling 
me how smart I am a,

759
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:32,100
there's no way to actually know if I'm 
smart or not because I think I'm full of

760
00:41:32,101 --> 00:41:34,280
bs and in the same,

761
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:38,300
uh,
I in the same round is fighting.

762
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:43,750
There's no,
it's Hixon Gracie said it means the or 

763
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,980
some of the solid rubber or somebody 
that the math doesn't lie.

764
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:50,180
There's this deep honesty in it that was
really grateful.

765
00:41:50,181 --> 00:41:53,090
Almost like wanting to talk about 
bullies.

766
00:41:53,091 --> 00:41:58,091
Are you talking about or even just my 
fellow academics could benefit 

767
00:41:58,091 --> 00:41:59,870
significantly from training a little 
bit.

768
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,760
I think so too.
It's a,

769
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:07,300
it's a beautiful thing to almost,
I think has been talked about in high 

770
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:07,820
school,
sort of requiring it,

771
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:12,470
thinking about the meantime.
So I think it's a more humbling sport to

772
00:42:12,471 --> 00:42:15,920
be honest than wrestling because you 
could in wrestling,

773
00:42:15,921 --> 00:42:18,860
like I said,
get away with some muscle.

774
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:24,030
It's also what martial arts we're 
supposed to be in that a small person 

775
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,250
who knows technique can beat a big 
person who doesn't know the technique.

776
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,900
That's right.
That's what we've always hoped for.

777
00:42:28,901 --> 00:42:33,901
Right.
When we saw the Bruce Lee movies and 

778
00:42:33,901 --> 00:42:35,971
Bruce Lee who was a smaller guy can beat
all these bigger guys just because he 

779
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:38,080
had better technique that is actually 
real in Jujitsu and it's one of the only

780
00:42:38,081 --> 00:42:40,600
martial arts where that's a real.
Yeah.

781
00:42:40,601 --> 00:42:41,800
And I,
uh,

782
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:42,450
I haven't

783
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:43,890
in Philadelphia.
It started,

784
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,780
we had Steve Maxwell here.
Sure.

785
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:50,930
That's kind of where the,
that was the spring of Jujitsu in 

786
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:50,930
Philadelphia.

787
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:54,680
Yeah.
He was one of the very first American 

788
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:54,680
black belts in Jujitsu.
Like way back in the day,

789
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:59,091
I believe he was a black belt in the 
very early nineties when Jujitsu was 

790
00:42:59,091 --> 00:43:04,041
really just starting to come to America 
and he had Max innercise in 

791
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:04,800
Philadelphia.

792
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:08,550
It's still there.
And then I trained at a balance which is

793
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,710
a,
a few gracie folks.

794
00:43:10,711 --> 00:43:11,830
Which film?
Inglorious rake,

795
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:14,000
mcglynn Hays basketball.
Go brothers.

796
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,210
So it,
I mean,

797
00:43:15,211 --> 00:43:18,320
especially Vogel brothers,
these couple of black belts,

798
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:20,910
they come up together.
Is there.

799
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:22,950
Well,
they're smaller,

800
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:28,680
the little guys.
And I think those were the guys that 

801
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:28,680
really humbled me pretty quickly.

802
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:33,260
Well,
little guys are the best to learn 

803
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:33,260
technique from.
Yeah.

804
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:36,120
Because they can't rely on strength.
There's a lot of really big,

805
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,320
powerful,
you know,

806
00:43:37,321 --> 00:43:42,321
250 pounds Jujitsu guys who never are 
going to develop the sort of subtlety of

807
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,160
technique that some like the Mayo 
brothers,

808
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:51,900
like smaller guys who just,
they've from the very beginning,

809
00:43:51,901 --> 00:43:56,901
they've never had an advantage in weight
and size and so they've never been able 

810
00:43:56,901 --> 00:44:00,891
to use anything but perfect technique.
Eddie Bravo is another great example of 

811
00:44:00,891 --> 00:44:00,891
that too.
You know,

812
00:44:00,891 --> 00:44:02,640
he,
he competed in the 140 pounds,

813
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:05,330
145 pound class,
you know,

814
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:10,340
um,
but to get back to artificial 

815
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,850
intelligence.
So the idea is that there's two camps,

816
00:44:11,851 --> 00:44:16,851
there's one camp that thinks that the 
exponential increase in technology and 

817
00:44:17,551 --> 00:44:20,070
that once artificial intelligence become
sentient,

818
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:25,460
it could eventually improve upon its own
design and literally become a god in a 

819
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:31,490
short amount of time.
And then there's the other school of 

820
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:34,521
thought that thinks that is far outside 
of the realm of what is possible today.

821
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:41,270
That even the speculation of this 
eventually taking place is kind of 

822
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:41,970
ludicrous to imagine.

823
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:43,700
Right.
Exactly.

824
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,760
And the balance needs to be struck 
because I think I'd like to talk about 

825
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,040
sort of the short term threats that are 
there and it's really important to think

826
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:54,500
about,
but the longterm threats,

827
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:58,580
if they come to fruition,
will overpower everything.

828
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,130
Right?
That's really important to think about,

829
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:06,550
but what happens is if you think too 
much about the encroaching doom of 

830
00:45:07,191 --> 00:45:12,191
humanity,
there is some aspect to it that is 

831
00:45:12,191 --> 00:45:16,301
paralyzing where you almost.
It turns you off from actually thinking 

832
00:45:16,761 --> 00:45:20,570
about the these ideas.
There's something so appealing.

833
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:25,930
It's like a black hole that pulls you in
and if you notice folks at Sam Harrison,

834
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:31,390
so on spend a large amount of the time 
talking about the negative stuff about 

835
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:38,950
something that's far away.
Not to say it's not wrong to talk about 

836
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:42,731
it,
but they spend very little time about 

837
00:45:42,731 --> 00:45:44,771
the potential positive impacts in the 
near term and also the negative impacts 

838
00:45:44,771 --> 00:45:44,990
of the near term.

839
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:50,410
So let's go over those fairness so that 
way the more and more we put decisions 

840
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:56,180
about our lives into the hands of 
artificial intelligence systems,

841
00:45:56,450 --> 00:46:01,450
whether you get a loan or a in the 
autonomous vehicle context or in terms 

842
00:46:02,871 --> 00:46:07,871
of recommending jobs for you on Linkedin
or all of these kinds of things,

843
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,440
the idea of fairness becomes a bias in 
these machine learning systems becomes a

844
00:46:14,721 --> 00:46:19,040
really big threat because the way 
current,

845
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:25,160
the way current artificial intelligence 
systems function is they train on data.

846
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:30,730
So there's no way to,
for them to somehow gain a greater 

847
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:33,950
intelligence than our,
than the data we provide them with.

848
00:46:33,951 --> 00:46:37,970
So we provide them with actual data and 
so they carry over if we're not careful,

849
00:46:37,971 --> 00:46:42,971
the biases in that data,
the discrimination that's inherent in 

850
00:46:42,971 --> 00:46:45,710
our current society is as represented by
the data.

851
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,660
So they'll just carry that forward.

852
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:51,530
Like also a.
So there's people working in this,

853
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:52,620
uh,
more so to see,

854
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:57,940
to show really the negative impacts in 
terms of getting a loan or whether to 

855
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:04,670
say whether this particular human being 
should be convicted or not of a crime.

856
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:06,860
Uh,
there's,

857
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:11,240
there's ideas there that can carry,
you know,

858
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:16,300
in our criminal system there's 
discrimination and if you use data from 

859
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,250
that criminal system to then assist the 
ciders,

860
00:47:19,251 --> 00:47:21,200
judges,
juries,

861
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:26,260
lawyers in making this community and 
make a decision of what kind of policy 

862
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,340
person gets,
they're going to carry that forward.

863
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:32,690
You mean like racial economic bias is 
racial economic?

864
00:47:32,691 --> 00:47:34,600
Yep.
Geographical.

865
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:38,860
And that's a sort of,
I don't say that exact problem,

866
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,570
but it's,
it's,

867
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:44,710
you're aware of it because of the tools 
we're using it only.

868
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:50,810
So the two ways that I'd like to talk 
about neural networks with the jail do 

869
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:53,540
it.

870
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:57,580
Okay.
So the current approaches are,

871
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,350
there's been a lot of,
uh,

872
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:05,760
demonstrated improvements,
exciting new improvements in our 

873
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,171
advancements of artificial intelligence.
And those are for the most part have to 

874
00:48:10,171 --> 00:48:14,371
do when your networks,
something has been around since the 19 

875
00:48:14,371 --> 00:48:17,761
forties has gone to,
to ai winters where everyone was super 

876
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:20,410
hyped and then super bummed and super 
hyped again and bombed again.

877
00:48:20,411 --> 00:48:25,411
And now we're in this other hype cycle.
And what you'll know xr is these 

878
00:48:25,991 --> 00:48:29,020
collections of interconnected simple 
compute units.

879
00:48:29,021 --> 00:48:34,021
They're all similar.
It's kind of like it's inspired by own 

880
00:48:34,021 --> 00:48:37,441
brain where have a bunch of little 
neurons interconnected and the idea is 

881
00:48:37,441 --> 00:48:39,820
these interconnections are really 
dominant and random,

882
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:45,060
but if you feed it with some data,
they'll learn to connect just like 

883
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,050
they're doing our brain in a way that 
interprets that data.

884
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:50,440
They formed representations of that data
and can make decisions,

885
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,520
but there's only two ways to train those
neural networks that we have.

886
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:59,520
Now.
One is we have to provide a large data 

887
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,401
set.
If you want that annual now could tell 

888
00:49:03,401 --> 00:49:04,420
the difference between a cat and dog.
You have to give it 10,000

889
00:49:04,421 --> 00:49:06,940
images of a cat and $10,000
with a dog.

890
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:13,080
You need to give those images and who 
tells you what a picture of a cat and a 

891
00:49:14,171 --> 00:49:15,670
dog is.
It's humans,

892
00:49:15,671 --> 00:49:20,671
so it has to be annotated.
So as teachers of these artificial 

893
00:49:20,671 --> 00:49:22,090
intelligence systems,
we have to collect this data.

894
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:27,690
We have to invest a significant amount 
of effort and annotate that data and 

895
00:49:28,691 --> 00:49:31,570
then we teach neural networks to make 
that prediction.

896
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:37,120
The what's not obvious there is how poor
of a method there is to achieve any kind

897
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:44,071
of greater degree of intelligence.
You're just not able to get very far 

898
00:49:44,071 --> 00:49:48,720
besides very specific narrow tasks of 
cat versus dog or a,

899
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:54,520
should I give this person a loan or not?
These kinds of simple simple tasks,

900
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:00,120
I would argue autonomous vehicles that 
are actually beyond the scope of that 

901
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:03,571
kind of approach.
And then the other realm of where you 

902
00:50:03,571 --> 00:50:07,270
know networks can be trained is if you 
can simulate that world.

903
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,960
So if the world is simple enough or it's
conducive to be formalized sufficiently 

904
00:50:14,981 --> 00:50:18,070
to where you can simulate it.
So a game of chess is just,

905
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:21,910
it's rules him a golden rule so you can 
simulate it.

906
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:25,600
They had.
The big exciting thing about Google deep

907
00:50:25,601 --> 00:50:28,160
mind is that there able to beat

908
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,550
the world champion by doing something 
called competitive self play a,

909
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:35,390
which is the two systems play against 
each other.

910
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,580
They don't need the human,
they play against each other,

911
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:43,060
but that only works and that's a 
beautiful idea and super powerful and 

912
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:45,800
really interesting and surprising,
but that only works on things like games

913
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:49,460
and simulation.
So now if I wanted to,

914
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:55,390
uh,
sorry to be going to analogies of like 

915
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:57,810
USC for example,
if I wanted to train the system to 

916
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:01,160
become the world champion,
uh,

917
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:03,170
be uh,
what's his name?

918
00:51:03,171 --> 00:51:04,550
Numbering them add up,
right?

919
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:09,710
I could play the UFC game,
I could create the,

920
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:15,090
you networks that play,
use competitive self play to play in 

921
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:18,290
that virtual world and they could become
state of the art,

922
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:23,350
the best fighter ever in that game.
But transferring that to the physical 

923
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:24,710
world,
we don't know how to do that.

924
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:28,910
We don't know how to teach systems to do
stuff in the real world.

925
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,540
So some of the stuff that freaks you out
often is Boston dynamics robots.

926
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:38,320
Yeah.
Does every day I go to the instagram 

927
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:38,320
page and just go,
what the fuck are you guys doing?

928
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:39,190
So,
uh,

929
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:44,290
nearing our demise.
Mark Graber CEO is a spoke of the class 

930
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:46,640
I taught.
He is a,

931
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:51,140
he calls himself a bad boy of robotics,
so he's having a little fun with it.

932
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:56,200
He should definitely stop doing that.
Don't call yourself a bad boy if 

933
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:56,200
anything.
That's true.

934
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:56,200
How old is he?

935
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:04,300
Okay.
He's one of the greatest roboticists of 

936
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:04,300
our generation,
so that's wonderful.

937
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,900
How would you call yourself a.
don't call yourself a bad boy,

938
00:52:05,901 --> 00:52:06,770
bro.
Okay,

939
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:11,040
so you say you're not the bad boy of 
MMA?

940
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:16,110
Definitely not,
but I'm not even the bad man.

941
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,800
Bad Man,
but definitely not a bad boy.

942
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:23,990
Okay.
That's a little silly.

943
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:30,310
Yeah.
The those robots are actually 

944
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:30,800
functioning in the physical world.
That's what I'm talking about.

945
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:36,370
And they are using something called 
always I think coined,

946
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:38,600
I dunno,
seventies or eighties.

947
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:43,660
The term good old fashioned ai meaning 
there is nothing like going on that you 

948
00:52:45,771 --> 00:52:50,771
would consider artificial intelligence,
which is usually connected to learning.

949
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:57,550
So these systems aren't learning.
It's not like you dropped a puppy into 

950
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:01,091
the,
into the world and you kind of stumbled 

951
00:53:01,091 --> 00:53:02,771
around and figuring stuff out and learns
and gets better and better and better 

952
00:53:02,771 --> 00:53:02,771
and better.

953
00:53:02,771 --> 00:53:06,580
That's the scary part.
That's the imagination that that's what 

954
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:09,911
we imagined is we put something in this 
world at first it's like harmless and 

955
00:53:09,921 --> 00:53:14,921
falls all over the place and all of a 
sudden they figure something out and 

956
00:53:14,921 --> 00:53:15,470
like Elon Musk says the travels faster 
than whatever.

957
00:53:15,471 --> 00:53:17,740
Then you can only see what the problem 
is.

958
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:23,320
There's no learning component there.
This is just purely there's hydraulics 

959
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:29,610
and electric motors and there is 20 to 
30 degrees of freedom and it's doing 

960
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:37,440
hardcoded control algorithms to control 
the task of how do you move efficiently 

961
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,141
through space.
So this is the task of this work on a 

962
00:53:42,141 --> 00:53:45,681
really,
really hard problem is taking a robotic 

963
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:46,620
manipulation,
taking arm,

964
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:51,830
grabbing a water bottle and lifting it 
super hard for the somewhat unsolved to 

965
00:53:52,321 --> 00:53:57,321
this point and learning to do that.
We really don't know how to do that 

966
00:53:57,321 --> 00:53:57,321
right,

967
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:02,550
but this is what we're talking about 
essentially is the convergence of these 

968
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:04,450
robotic systems with artificial 
intelligence systems,

969
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:06,460
right?
And as artificial intelligence,

970
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:11,590
intelligence systems evolve and then 
this convergence becomes complete.

971
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:17,580
You're going to have the ability to do 
things like the computer that beat 

972
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:20,980
humans at go.
You're going to have creativity,

973
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:26,250
you're going to have a complex 
understanding of language and 

974
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:30,120
expression,
and you're going to have perhaps even 

975
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,860
engineered things like emotions like 
jealousy and anger.

976
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,380
I mean it's,
it's entirely possible,

977
00:54:35,381 --> 00:54:40,381
but as you were saying,
we're going to have systems that could 

978
00:54:40,381 --> 00:54:44,551
potentially be biased the way human 
beings are biased towards people of 

979
00:54:44,551 --> 00:54:49,111
certain economic groups or certain 
geographic groups and you would use that

980
00:54:49,151 --> 00:54:52,570
data that they have to discriminate just
like human beings discriminating.

981
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:58,610
What if you have all that in an 
artificially intelligent robot that has 

982
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:00,400
autonomy and that has the ability to 
move.

983
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:05,640
This is what people are totally 
concerned with and terrified of is that 

984
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,440
all of these different systems that are 
currently in Semite crude states,

985
00:55:08,441 --> 00:55:13,441
they can't pick up a water bottle yet.
They can't really do much other than 

986
00:55:13,441 --> 00:55:13,441
they can do back flips,
but they.

987
00:55:13,441 --> 00:55:15,580
You know,
I'm sure you've seen this,

988
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,240
the more recent Boston dynamic ones,
powercore yeah,

989
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:20,940
I saw that one the other day.
It's good.

990
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,780
They're getting better and better and 
better,

991
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:25,600
and it's.
It's increasing every year.

992
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:29,410
Every year there's new abilities.
Did you see the Black Mirror episode?

993
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:30,310
Heavy metal?

994
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:35,770
Yeah,
and I think about quite a lot because 

995
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:37,991
it's a functionally it has.
We know how to do most aspects of that 

996
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:41,870
right now.
Right now.

997
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:42,550
When you close.
Yeah,

998
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:43,520
pretty close.
I mean I.

999
00:55:43,521 --> 00:55:48,521
I don't remember exactly.
There's some kind of pebbles shooting 

1000
00:55:48,521 --> 00:55:50,210
situation where it like hurts you by 
shooting you somehow.

1001
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:51,470
I figured.
Well,

1002
00:55:51,471 --> 00:55:52,580
it has bullets,
didn't it?

1003
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,300
Bullets.
Yeah.

1004
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:54,440
Is it basically a gun?

1005
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,690
It had a knife.
It stuck into one of its arms.

1006
00:55:56,691 --> 00:56:01,691
Remember and come the spoiler alert.
It's just an amazing episode of how 

1007
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:06,580
terrifying it would be if some 
emotionless robot with incredible 

1008
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,870
abilities is coming after you and wants 
to terminate you

1009
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:14,180
and I think about that a lot because I 
love that episode because it's 

1010
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:19,040
terrifying for some reason,
but when I sit down and actually in the 

1011
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,971
work we're doing,
think about how we would do that so we 

1012
00:56:22,971 --> 00:56:23,970
can do the actual movement of the robot.
Well,

1013
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:28,980
we don't know how to do is to have 
robots that do the full thing,

1014
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:31,780
which is have some,
have,

1015
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:34,790
have a goal of pursuing humans and 
eradicated.

1016
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:37,720
I'm not spoiler alert all over the 
place.

1017
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:42,340
Uh,
I think the goal of eradicating human,

1018
00:56:42,341 --> 00:56:44,650
so assuming their values are not aligned
somehow,

1019
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:50,160
that's one we don't know how to do that.
And two is the entire process of just 

1020
00:56:50,411 --> 00:56:54,310
navigating all over the world is really 
difficult.

1021
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:59,700
So we know how to go up the stairs.
But to say how to navigate the path you 

1022
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:04,621
took from home to the studio today,
how to get through that full path is so 

1023
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:05,860
much an unsolved problem.

1024
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:11,130
But is it because you could do,
you could engineer or you could program 

1025
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:14,431
it into your tesla.
You can put it into your navigation 

1026
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:17,281
system and have it stop at Red Lights 
drive for you take turns and it can do 

1027
00:57:17,501 --> 00:57:17,770
that.

1028
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:23,810
So first of all,
that I would argue is quite far away 

1029
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:24,120
from still,
but that's within 10,

1030
00:57:24,121 --> 00:57:25,320
20 years.
But what,

1031
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:29,460
how much can it do now?
It can stay inside the lane,

1032
00:57:29,461 --> 00:57:33,180
on the highway or on different roads and
it can change lanes,

1033
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:38,480
and what's being pushed now is they're 
trying to be able to enter and exit the 

1034
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,920
highway,
so there's some basic highway driving.

1035
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:45,950
It doesn't stop at traffic lights,
it doesn't stop at stop signs and it 

1036
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:50,061
doesn't interact with the complex 
irrational human beings,

1037
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:53,790
pedestrians and cyclists,
cars.

1038
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:59,090
That's.
This is the onion I talked about is we 

1039
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:01,650
first in 2005,
the Darpa grand challenge.

1040
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:05,250
Dopper organized this challenge in the 
desert says,

1041
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:10,520
let's go across the desert.
Let's see if we can build an autonomous 

1042
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:10,520
vehicle that goes across the desert.
Two thousand four,

1043
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:14,400
the first one and everybody failed.
We're talking about some of the smartest

1044
00:58:14,401 --> 00:58:18,630
people in the world and really tried and
failed and so they did.

1045
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:19,800
Again,
2005.

1046
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:25,310
There's a few.
Stanford one is a really bad ass guy 

1047
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:25,460
from Cmu.
Read that.

1048
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:30,480
I think he's like a marine.
He led the team there and they 

1049
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:30,480
succeeded.
The fourteens finished Stanford,

1050
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:35,031
one that was in the desert and there was
this feeling that we solved the 

1051
00:58:35,031 --> 00:58:38,430
autonomous driving,
but that's that onion because you then,

1052
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:39,690
okay,
what's the next step?

1053
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,510
We've got a card that travels across the
desert autonomously.

1054
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,680
What's the next?
So then 2007.

1055
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:49,650
They did the urban grant challenges,
the urban challenge.

1056
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:54,651
Darpa urban challenge where you drove 
around the city a little bit and again,

1057
00:58:54,751 --> 00:58:59,010
super hard problem.
People took it on a Cmu one.

1058
00:58:59,011 --> 00:59:02,460
That one,
the Stanford second I believe,

1059
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:06,750
and then there was definitely a feeling 
like,

1060
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:09,330
yeah,
we now the car drive around the city.

1061
00:59:09,331 --> 00:59:12,990
It's definitely solved.
The problem is those cars were traveling

1062
00:59:12,991 --> 00:59:17,991
super slow first of all,
and second of all there's no 

1063
00:59:17,991 --> 00:59:17,991
pedestrians.

1064
00:59:17,991 --> 00:59:19,110
There's no.
It wasn't a real city.

1065
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:24,140
It was an artificial.
It's just basically having to stop and 

1066
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:27,581
different signs again,
one other layer of the onion and he'd 

1067
00:59:27,581 --> 00:59:27,581
say,
okay,

1068
00:59:27,581 --> 00:59:30,440
when we actually have to put this car in
a city like La,

1069
00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:34,250
our,
we're going to make this work because if

1070
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:39,080
there's no cars in the street and no 
pedestrians in the street driving around

1071
00:59:39,081 --> 00:59:44,081
is still hard but doable and I think 
solvable the next five years when you 

1072
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:49,061
put pedestrians,
everybody Jaywalks if you put human 

1073
00:59:49,221 --> 00:59:50,900
beings into,
into this interaction,

1074
00:59:50,901 --> 00:59:52,370
it becomes much,
much harder.

1075
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:57,880
Now.
It's not impossible and I think it's 

1076
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,960
very doable and with completely new 
interesting ideas,

1077
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:05,380
including revolutionizing infrastructure
and rethinking a transportation in 

1078
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:06,980
general,
it's possible to do the next five,

1079
01:00:06,981 --> 01:00:08,360
10 years,
maybe 20,

1080
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:13,790
but it's not easy like everybody says.
And does anybody say it's easy?

1081
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:15,610
Yeah.
This,

1082
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:17,440
uh,
the,

1083
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,400
there's a lot of height between 
autonomous,

1084
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:24,610
behind the autonomous vehicles.
Elon musk himself and other people have 

1085
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:26,690
promised autonomous vehicles that that 
timeline is already past.

1086
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:31,980
That has been going on in 2018.
We'll have autonomous vehicles now for 

1087
01:00:32,691 --> 01:00:32,940
ge

1088
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:34,650
semiautonomous now.
Right?

1089
01:00:34,651 --> 01:00:38,640
So I know they do.
They can break for pedestrians.

1090
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:43,790
Like if they see pedestrians are 
supposed to break for them and avoid 

1091
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:43,790
them,
right?

1092
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:45,480
That's part of the technically no.

1093
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:50,550
Was that an issue with an Uber Car that 
hit a pedestrian that was operating 

1094
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:50,550
autonomously?
Someone,

1095
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:52,750
a homeless person stepped out off of a 
median,

1096
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:58,080
right into traffic and it nailed it.
And then they found out it didn't have 

1097
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:58,150
just one of the settings

1098
01:00:58,310 --> 01:00:59,680
wasn't in place.
That's all right.

1099
01:00:59,681 --> 01:01:02,590
But that wasn't autonomous vehicles 
being tested in Arizona.

1100
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,750
And uh,
unfortunately there's a fatality.

1101
01:01:04,751 --> 01:01:06,070
A person,
a person died at.

1102
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:09,550
Pedestrian was killed.
So what happened there?

1103
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:15,650
That's the,
that's the thing I'm saying is really 

1104
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:15,650
hard.
That's full autonomy.

1105
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:18,460
That's technically when the car,
you can remove the steering wheel in the

1106
01:01:18,461 --> 01:01:20,470
car to drive itself and take care of 
everything.

1107
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:22,300
Everything.
I've seen,

1108
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:27,360
everything we're studying,
we're studying drivers and Tesla 

1109
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,150
vehicles.
We're building our own vehicles.

1110
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:33,750
It seems that it will be a long way off 
before console the fully autonomous 

1111
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:37,390
driving problem because of pedestrians 
and.

1112
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:42,410
But two things and pedestrians and 
cyclists and the edge cases are driving 

1113
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:48,660
all this stuff we take for granted.
The same reason we take for granted how 

1114
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:51,430
hard it is to walk,
how hard it is to pick up this bottle,

1115
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:55,900
our intuition about what's hard and easy
is really flawed as human beings.

1116
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,560
Can I interject what if,
uh,

1117
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:01,350
all cars were autonomous?
That's true.

1118
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:06,340
If we got to a point where every single 
car on the highway is operating off of a

1119
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:08,650
similar algorithm or off the same 
system,

1120
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,870
then things would be far easier,
right?

1121
01:02:10,871 --> 01:02:11,770
Because then you have to,
don't,

1122
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:14,050
don't deal with random kinetic 
movements.

1123
01:02:14,051 --> 01:02:17,640
People just changing lanes,
people looking at their cell phone,

1124
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:19,060
not paying attention to what they're 
doing.

1125
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:21,480
All sorts of things that you have to be 
wary of right now.

1126
01:02:21,481 --> 01:02:24,270
Driving and pedestrians and bicyclists.

1127
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:25,980
Totally.
And that's,

1128
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:31,170
that's in the realm of things I'm 
talking about where you think outside 

1129
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:33,821
the box and,
and revolutionize our transportation 

1130
01:02:33,821 --> 01:02:34,830
system that requires government to,
uh,

1131
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:36,530
to play along.

1132
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:37,820
It seems like that's going that way 
though,

1133
01:02:37,821 --> 01:02:42,821
right?
Do you feel like that one day we're 

1134
01:02:42,821 --> 01:02:43,430
going to have autonomous driving pretty 
much everywhere,

1135
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:45,140
especially on the highway.

1136
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:49,250
It's not going there in terms of,
uh,

1137
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:51,330
it's,
it's very slow moving.

1138
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:54,180
So if government does stuff very slow 
moving with infrastructure,

1139
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:59,360
one of the biggest things you can do for
autonomous driving will solve a lot of 

1140
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:03,081
problems is to paint lane markings 
regularly.

1141
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:07,180
And even that sucks have been extremely 
difficult to do for,

1142
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:08,220
for,
for.

1143
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,930
Yeah,
for a politician

1144
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,460
because right now there's not really the
desire for it.

1145
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:15,630
But to explain to people what you mean 
by that.

1146
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:21,260
When the lanes are painted very clearly,
the cameras and the autonomous vehicles 

1147
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:23,580
can recognize them and stay inside those
lines much more easily.

1148
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:28,640
Yeah.
There is two ways that car see the 

1149
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,700
world.
Three different sensors.

1150
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:33,300
The big ones for autonomous vehicles is 
lidar,

1151
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:38,430
which is these lasers are being shuttled
over the place and three 60 and they can

1152
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:41,130
give you this point cloud or how far 
stuff as a way,

1153
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:46,430
but they don't give you the visual 
texture information of this is what 

1154
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:48,900
brand water bottle they are.
And cameras give you that information.

1155
01:03:48,901 --> 01:03:51,720
So what Tesla is using have eight 
cameras,

1156
01:03:51,721 --> 01:03:55,080
I think is they perceive the world with,
with,

1157
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:56,220
uh,
with cameras,

1158
01:03:56,700 --> 01:04:00,390
and those two things require different 
things from the infrastructure.

1159
01:04:00,391 --> 01:04:03,120
Those two sensors,
cameras see the world,

1160
01:04:03,121 --> 01:04:05,310
the same arc as are humanized,
see the world.

1161
01:04:05,311 --> 01:04:10,311
So they need the lane markings,
they need infrastructure to be really 

1162
01:04:10,311 --> 01:04:10,920
nicely visible,
traffic lights to be visible.

1163
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:16,400
So the same kind of things as humans 
like to have is the cameras like to 

1164
01:04:16,981 --> 01:04:18,840
have.
And landmark is a big one.

1165
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:24,470
The other,
there's a lot of interesting 

1166
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:24,470
infrastructure improvements that can 
happen.

1167
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:28,170
Like traffic lights or traffic lights 
are super dumb right now.

1168
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:33,060
They sense nothing about the world,
about the density of pedestrians,

1169
01:04:33,061 --> 01:04:35,820
about the approach and cars.
If,

1170
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:40,890
if,
if traffic lights can communicate with 

1171
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:42,090
the car,
which it makes perfect sense,

1172
01:04:42,091 --> 01:04:42,850
it's a,
it's a,

1173
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:46,050
it's right there,
there's no size limitations.

1174
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:48,990
It can have a computer inside of it.
Uh,

1175
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:53,070
you can coordinate different things that
in terms of the same pedestrian kinds of

1176
01:04:53,071 --> 01:04:53,390
problem.

1177
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:55,280
Well,
we have sensors now in streets.

1178
01:04:55,310 --> 01:04:57,560
So when you pull up to certain lights,
especially at night,

1179
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,330
um,
the light will be red,

1180
01:04:59,331 --> 01:05:04,331
you pull up an instantaneously turns 
green because it recognizes that you've 

1181
01:05:04,331 --> 01:05:04,670
stepped over or driven over a sensor.

1182
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:06,190
That's right.
So that's a,

1183
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:10,930
that's a step in the right direction,
but that's really sort of crew 20 years,

1184
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:12,700
30 years ago,
technology.

1185
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:18,040
So you want to have something like the 
power of a smartphone inside

1186
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,530
every traffic light.
It's pretty basic to do,

1187
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:25,560
but there is way outside of my expertise
is how do you get government to do these

1188
01:05:25,871 --> 01:05:26,650
kinds of improvements.

1189
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,730
So if I'm mistaken,
correct me if I'm mistaken,

1190
01:05:29,731 --> 01:05:34,731
but you're,
you're looking at things in terms of 

1191
01:05:34,731 --> 01:05:34,731
what we can do right now,
right?

1192
01:05:34,731 --> 01:05:36,300
And a guy like Elon musk or Sam Harris 
is saying,

1193
01:05:36,690 --> 01:05:40,860
yeah,
but look at where technology leads us.

1194
01:05:40,861 --> 01:05:45,861
If you go back to 1960,
the kind of computers that they use to 

1195
01:05:45,861 --> 01:05:50,570
do the Apollo mission,
you've got a whole room full of 

1196
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:53,721
computers that doesn't have nearly the 
same power as the phone that's in your 

1197
01:05:53,721 --> 01:05:57,561
pocket right now.
Now if you go into the future and 

1198
01:05:57,561 --> 01:06:02,270
exponentially calculate like what's 
going to take place in terms of our 

1199
01:06:03,661 --> 01:06:08,661
ability to create autonomous vehicles or
ability to create artificial 

1200
01:06:08,661 --> 01:06:13,431
intelligence and all of these things 
going from what we have right now to 

1201
01:06:13,951 --> 01:06:18,951
what could be in 20 years where we very 
well might look at some sort of an 

1202
01:06:20,491 --> 01:06:24,500
artificial being that can communicate 
with you some sort of an x mark and that

1203
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:25,800
type creature.
I mean,

1204
01:06:25,801 --> 01:06:30,801
that's,
that's not outside the realm of 

1205
01:06:30,801 --> 01:06:30,801
possibility at all.

1206
01:06:30,801 --> 01:06:32,990
You have to be careful with the at all 
part at all.

1207
01:06:33,830 --> 01:06:38,830
Uh,
it's our ability to predict the future 

1208
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:39,050
is really difficult.
But I agree with you.

1209
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:40,760
It's not outside the realm of 
possibility.

1210
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:43,520
Yeah.
And the thing,

1211
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:48,570
there's,
there's a few examples that brought 

1212
01:06:48,570 --> 01:06:49,460
along just because I enjoy these 
predictions.

1213
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,930
So the,
the,

1214
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:56,470
the,
of how bad we are predicting stuff from 

1215
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:59,861
the engineers.
The very guys and gals like me sitting 

1216
01:06:59,861 --> 01:07:04,781
before you made some of the worst 
predictions in history in terms of both 

1217
01:07:04,781 --> 01:07:06,410
pessimistic and optimistic.
The Wright brothers,

1218
01:07:06,411 --> 01:07:08,960
one of the Wright brothers before they 
flew in 19.

1219
01:07:08,961 --> 01:07:12,710
Oh,
three predicted two years before that it

1220
01:07:12,711 --> 01:07:17,711
will be 50 years.
I confess that in 19.

1221
01:07:18,471 --> 01:07:20,600
Oh one.
That's one of the brothers talking.

1222
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,340
I said to my brother,
Orville,

1223
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:26,510
that man would not fly for 50 years.
Two years later,

1224
01:07:26,511 --> 01:07:31,511
we ourselves were making flights.
This demonstration of my inability as a 

1225
01:07:31,511 --> 01:07:35,951
prophet gave me such shock that I have 
ever since distress them myself and have

1226
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:40,370
refrained from all prediction.
That's one of the Wright brothers,

1227
01:07:40,371 --> 01:07:42,530
one of the people working in the past

1228
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:47,740
mystic estimation versus an optimistic 
as explanation or A.

1229
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:48,190
Exactly.

1230
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:53,230
And,
and the same with a Albert Einstein for 

1231
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:56,521
me,
made these kind of pessimistic 

1232
01:07:56,521 --> 01:07:56,521
observations,
uh,

1233
01:07:56,521 --> 01:07:57,180
for me,
three years before they,

1234
01:07:57,690 --> 01:07:59,730
the first critical chain reaction as 
part of the,

1235
01:07:59,731 --> 01:08:01,830
he led the nuclear development,
the bomb.

1236
01:08:02,350 --> 01:08:04,650
He said that it would,
he has 90 percent confidence.

1237
01:08:04,651 --> 01:08:07,380
That's impossible three years before.
Okay.

1238
01:08:07,381 --> 01:08:10,110
So that's on the pessimistic side.
On the optimistic side,

1239
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:14,310
the history of ai is laden with,
with optimistic predictions.

1240
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:15,650
Uh,
the,

1241
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:17,960
in uh,
19,

1242
01:08:17,961 --> 01:08:19,640
65,
one of the seminar

1243
01:08:19,690 --> 01:08:24,690
people in ai,
Herbert Simon said machines will be 

1244
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:25,240
capable within 20 years of doing any 
work command can do.

1245
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:30,600
He also said within 10 years of digital 
computer will be the world chess 

1246
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,811
champion that's in 58 and we didn't do 
that until 90 something 90 years and 40 

1247
01:08:34,391 --> 01:08:35,650
years.
But that's one person.

1248
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:40,420
It's a guy taking a stab in the dark 
based on what data and what's he,

1249
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:43,210
what's he based this off of our 
imagination.

1250
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:46,480
We have more data points now though,
don't you think in terms of.

1251
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:47,680
No,
not about the future.

1252
01:08:48,130 --> 01:08:50,440
That's the thing,
not about the future,

1253
01:08:50,441 --> 01:08:52,960
but about what's possible right now.

1254
01:08:53,490 --> 01:08:58,490
Right?
And if you look at the past is a really 

1255
01:08:58,490 --> 01:08:59,640
bad predictor of the future.
If you look at the past,

1256
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:05,870
what we've done,
the immense advancement of technology 

1257
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:08,430
has given us in many ways optimism about
what's possible,

1258
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:12,510
but exactly what is possible.
We're not good at.

1259
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:17,960
So I am much more confident that the 
world will look very fascinating.

1260
01:09:19,661 --> 01:09:24,090
The different in the future,
whether ai will be part of that world is

1261
01:09:24,091 --> 01:09:29,091
unclear.
It could be we will all live in a 

1262
01:09:29,091 --> 01:09:29,940
virtual reality world for or for 
example,

1263
01:09:29,941 --> 01:09:34,941
one of the things I'm really think about
is to me a s s a really dumb ai on 1 

1264
01:09:39,450 --> 01:09:44,450
billion smartphones is potentially more 
impactful than a superintelligent ai on 

1265
01:09:44,821 --> 01:09:47,380
one smartphone.
That the,

1266
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:52,690
the,
the fact that everybody now has 

1267
01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:52,800
smartphones,
this kind of access to information,

1268
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:57,270
the way we communicate the,
the globalization of everything,

1269
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:02,300
the potential impact there of just even 
subtle improvements in ai could be.

1270
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:07,320
It could completely change the fabric of
our society in a way where these 

1271
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:11,211
discussions about an ex,
that type lady walking around will be 

1272
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:15,861
silly because we'll all be either living
on Mars or living in virtual reality or 

1273
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:21,560
in this.
There's so many exciting possibilities 

1274
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:22,620
and what I believe in is we have to 
think about them.

1275
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:27,640
We have to talk about them.
Technology's always the source of 

1276
01:10:28,921 --> 01:10:30,690
danger,
of risk.

1277
01:10:32,970 --> 01:10:37,970
All of the biggest things that 
threatened our civilization at the small

1278
01:10:38,131 --> 01:10:43,131
and large scale all are connected to 
misuse of technology.

1279
01:10:43,411 --> 01:10:48,411
We develop and at the same time it's 
that very technology that will empower 

1280
01:10:49,021 --> 01:10:52,500
us and save us.
So there's a Max tegmark brilliant guy,

1281
01:10:52,530 --> 01:10:57,530
like three point zero.
I recommend people read his book on 

1282
01:10:57,530 --> 01:11:00,920
artificial general intelligence.
He talks about the race that there 

1283
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:01,890
there's a,
there's a race that can't be stopped.

1284
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:07,160
One is the development of technology and
the other is the development of our 

1285
01:11:07,681 --> 01:11:12,681
wisdom of how to stop or the how to 
control the technology and it's this 

1286
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,340
kind of race and

1287
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:19,460
our wisdom is now is always one step 
behind and then that's why we need to 

1288
01:11:20,491 --> 01:11:24,210
invest in it and keep sort of,
keep always thinking about new ideas.

1289
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:29,540
So right now we're talking about Ai.
We don't know what it's going to look 

1290
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:30,810
like in five years.
We have to keep thinking about.

1291
01:11:30,811 --> 01:11:35,811
We have to through simulation,
explore different ideas through 

1292
01:11:35,811 --> 01:11:39,081
conferences,
have debates come up with different 

1293
01:11:39,081 --> 01:11:41,280
approaches of how to solve particular 
problems.

1294
01:11:41,281 --> 01:11:46,281
Like I said,
with bias or how to solve deep fakes 

1295
01:11:46,281 --> 01:11:48,711
where you fake.
You can make Donald Trump or president 

1296
01:11:48,711 --> 01:11:52,311
of foreign president Obama saying 
anything or you can have facebook 

1297
01:11:52,311 --> 01:11:56,631
advertisement.
Harvard hypertargeted a advertisements 

1298
01:11:56,631 --> 01:12:00,020
how we can deal with those situations 
and constantly have this race of wisdom 

1299
01:12:00,181 --> 01:12:01,250
versus,
uh,

1300
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:05,250
the development of technology but not to
sit and think,

1301
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:08,940
well,
look at the,

1302
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:11,850
you know,
look at the development of technology,

1303
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:16,910
imagine what it could do in 50 years and
we're all screwed because that's 

1304
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,720
important to sort of be nervous about it
in that way,

1305
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:27,200
but it's not conducive to what do we do 
about it and the people that know what 

1306
01:12:28,111 --> 01:12:32,060
to do about it are the people trying to 
build this technology,

1307
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:33,300
building this future once

1308
01:12:33,710 --> 01:12:35,680
I didn't know what to do about it 
because like,

1309
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:38,690
well let's,
let's put it in terms of Elon Musk,

1310
01:12:38,691 --> 01:12:40,870
right?
Like Elon Musk is terrified of,

1311
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,690
of artificial intelligence because he 
thinks by the time it becomes sentient,

1312
01:12:44,691 --> 01:12:46,820
it'll be too late.
It'll be smarter than us.

1313
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:52,360
And we'll,
we'll have essentially created our 

1314
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:52,360
successors.
Yes.

1315
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:55,400
And let me quote Joe Rogan and say 
that's just one guy.

1316
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,040
Yeah.
Well Sam Harris thinks the same thing.

1317
01:12:58,350 --> 01:13:03,350
Yes.
And there's quite a few people that 

1318
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:03,350
think that Sam Harris.
Okay.

1319
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:06,490
I think was one of the smartest people I
know and Ilan mosque intelligence aside 

1320
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:08,690
is one of the most impactful people I 
know.

1321
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:13,240
He's actually building these cars and in
the narrow ai sense,

1322
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:17,960
if he's built these autopilot system 
that we've been studying,

1323
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:24,250
the way that system works is incredible.
It was very surprising to me on many 

1324
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:27,110
levels.
It's an incredible demonstration of what

1325
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:30,110
ai can do in a positive way in the 
world.

1326
01:13:30,530 --> 01:13:34,760
So I don't know,
but I people can disagree.

1327
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:40,660
I'm not sure the functional value of his
fear about the possibility of this.

1328
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:48,100
Correct.
There's functional value in pitting the 

1329
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:50,841
brakes before this takes place.
The just just to be a person who's 

1330
01:13:50,911 --> 01:13:54,900
standing on top of the rocks with a 
light to warn the boats.

1331
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,520
Hey,
there's a rock here.

1332
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:00,750
Like pay attention to where we're going 
because there's perils ahead.

1333
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:03,320
I think that's what he's saying.
That's an.

1334
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:05,710
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with saying that and I think there's.

1335
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:10,860
There's plenty of room for people saying
what he saying and people saying what 

1336
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:11,010
you're saying.
I,

1337
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:14,350
what would hurt us is if we tried to 
silence either voice.

1338
01:14:14,590 --> 01:14:19,590
I think what we need in terms of our 
understanding of this future is many,

1339
01:14:22,271 --> 01:14:22,930
many,
many,

1340
01:14:22,931 --> 01:14:25,990
many,
many of these conversations where you're

1341
01:14:25,991 --> 01:14:30,991
dealing with the,
the current state of technology versus a

1342
01:14:31,931 --> 01:14:36,700
bunch of creative interpretations of 
where this could go and have discussions

1343
01:14:36,701 --> 01:14:41,701
about where it should go or what could 
be the possible pitfalls of any current 

1344
01:14:42,941 --> 01:14:47,941
or future actions.
I don't think there's anything wrong 

1345
01:14:47,941 --> 01:14:50,821
with this.
So when you say like what's the benefit 

1346
01:14:50,821 --> 01:14:51,130
of thinking in a negative way?
Well,

1347
01:14:51,131 --> 01:14:53,380
it's to prevent our demise.

1348
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:59,020
So totally I agree on a percent nae 
negativity or worry about the 

1349
01:15:00,291 --> 01:15:04,520
existential threat is really important 
to have as part of the conversation,

1350
01:15:04,970 --> 01:15:06,770
but there's this level,
there's this line.

1351
01:15:06,771 --> 01:15:11,771
It's hard to put into words is it is a 
line that you cross when that worry 

1352
01:15:11,771 --> 01:15:13,100
becomes hyperbole.
Yeah,

1353
01:15:13,101 --> 01:15:15,890
and then it.
There's something about the human psyche

1354
01:15:15,891 --> 01:15:17,630
where it becomes paralyzing for some 
reason.

1355
01:15:17,690 --> 01:15:22,160
Right now when I have beers with my 
friends than none ai folks,

1356
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:27,460
we actually go,
we crossed that line all day and have 

1357
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:28,400
fun with it.
I talked to she get you drunk right now.

1358
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:33,700
Maybe a regret every moment of it.
This I talked to Steve Pinker a 

1359
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:40,060
enlightenment.
Now his book kind of highlights that,

1360
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,090
that kind of,
um,

1361
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:49,620
that he's totally doesn't find that 
appealing because that's crossing all 

1362
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:52,520
realms of rationality and reason.
Would you say that appealing?

1363
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:56,030
What do you mean crossing the line into 
what will happen in 50 years?

1364
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:58,390
What could have happened?
He doesn't find that appealing.

1365
01:15:58,770 --> 01:16:03,770
It doesn't find it appealing because 
he's studied and I'm not sure I agree 

1366
01:16:03,770 --> 01:16:03,770
with him.
Uh,

1367
01:16:03,770 --> 01:16:08,470
to the degree that he takes it,
he finds that there's no evidence he 

1368
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:15,640
wants there to all our discussions to be
grounded in evidence and data.

1369
01:16:16,190 --> 01:16:21,190
And he,
he highlights the fact that there's 

1370
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:23,830
something about human psyche that 
desires this negativity that it wants.

1371
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:30,530
There's,
there's something undeniable where we 

1372
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:33,011
want to create an engineer.
The gods that overpower us and destroy 

1373
01:16:33,281 --> 01:16:36,530
us.
We want to or we worry about it.

1374
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:41,450
There's stuff we want to that we.
Let me rephrase that.

1375
01:16:41,451 --> 01:16:44,770
We want to worry about it.
There's something about the psyche that.

1376
01:16:44,771 --> 01:16:44,920
But

1377
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:48,040
because you can't take the genie and put
it back in the bottle.

1378
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:49,130
Yeah.
I mean,

1379
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:52,820
when you say there's no reason to think 
this way,

1380
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:58,540
but if you do have cars that are semi 
autonomous now and if you do have 

1381
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:03,341
computers that can beat human beings who
are world go champions and if you do 

1382
01:17:03,341 --> 01:17:08,081
have computers,
computers that can be people at chess 

1383
01:17:08,081 --> 01:17:10,511
and you do have people that are 
consistently working on artificial 

1384
01:17:10,511 --> 01:17:13,031
intelligence and you do Boston dynamics 
who are getting these robots to do all 

1385
01:17:13,461 --> 01:17:17,870
sorts of spectacular physical stunts and
then you think about the possible future

1386
01:17:17,871 --> 01:17:21,830
convergence of all these technologies 
and then you think about the possibility

1387
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:26,860
of this exponential increase in 
technology that allows them to be 

1388
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:28,460
sentient like within a decade,
two decades,

1389
01:17:28,461 --> 01:17:29,950
three decades.
What?

1390
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:34,040
What more evidence do you need your.
You're seeing all the building blocks of

1391
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:39,041
a potential successor being laid out in 
front of you and you're seeing what we 

1392
01:17:39,041 --> 01:17:42,530
do with every single aspect of 
technology.

1393
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:45,530
We constantly and consistently improve 
and innovate right?

1394
01:17:45,531 --> 01:17:50,531
With everything,
whether it's computers or cars or 

1395
01:17:50,531 --> 01:17:52,871
anything.
Everything today is better than 

1396
01:17:52,871 --> 01:17:52,871
everything.
That was 20 years ago,

1397
01:17:52,871 --> 01:17:55,280
so if you looked at artificial 
intelligence,

1398
01:17:55,281 --> 01:17:58,250
which does agree does exist to a certain
extent,

1399
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:01,940
and you,
you look at what it could potentially be

1400
01:18:01,941 --> 01:18:03,020
30,
40,

1401
01:18:03,021 --> 01:18:04,610
50 years from now,
whatever it is,

1402
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:08,450
why wouldn't you look at all these data 
points and say,

1403
01:18:08,451 --> 01:18:10,820
hey,
this could go bad.

1404
01:18:10,821 --> 01:18:12,680
I mean,
it could go great,

1405
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:14,390
but it could also go bad.

1406
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:21,490
I do not want to be mistaken as the 
person who is not the champion or the 

1407
01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:22,070
impossible.
I agree with you completely.

1408
01:18:22,150 --> 01:18:25,460
I think it's impossible.
I don't think it's impossible at all.

1409
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:29,530
I think it's inevitable.
I don't.

1410
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:31,600
I think it is inevitable.
Yes.

1411
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:36,010
It's the Sam Harris argument.
If,

1412
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:39,460
if superintelligence is nothing more 
than information processing

1413
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:40,170
[inaudible]

1414
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:46,140
uh,
same as the argument of the simulation 

1415
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:48,080
that we're living in a simulation that's
very difficult to argue against the fact

1416
01:18:48,081 --> 01:18:53,081
that we're living in a simulation.
The question is when and what the world 

1417
01:18:53,081 --> 01:18:53,840
would look like.
Right?

1418
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,510
So it's like I said,
a race and,

1419
01:18:56,710 --> 01:19:00,950
and it's difficult.
You have to balance those two minds.

1420
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:02,270
I agree with you.
Totally.

1421
01:19:02,271 --> 01:19:07,271
You and I disagree with my fellow 
robotics folks who don't want to think 

1422
01:19:07,271 --> 01:19:08,180
about it at all.
Of course they don't.

1423
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:08,180
I

1424
01:19:08,230 --> 01:19:13,230
don't want to buy new houses.
Think they've got a lot of money 

1425
01:19:13,230 --> 01:19:13,570
invested in this adventure.
They want to keep the party rolling.

1426
01:19:13,571 --> 01:19:18,571
They don't want to pull the brakes.
Everybody pulled the cords out of the 

1427
01:19:18,571 --> 01:19:18,571
walls.
We've got to stop.

1428
01:19:18,571 --> 01:19:18,940
No one's going to do that.
No one's.

1429
01:19:18,970 --> 01:19:20,320
No one's going to come along and say,
Hey,

1430
01:19:20,321 --> 01:19:25,321
we've.
We've run all this data through a 

1431
01:19:25,321 --> 01:19:27,001
computer,
and we found that if we just keep going 

1432
01:19:27,001 --> 01:19:27,001
the way we're going in 30 years from 
now,

1433
01:19:27,001 --> 01:19:30,211
we will have a successor that will 
decide that human beings are outdated 

1434
01:19:30,211 --> 01:19:33,991
and inefficient and dangerous to the the
actual world that we live in and we're 

1435
01:19:34,271 --> 01:19:39,271
going to start wiping them out,
but that's not the exists right now.

1436
01:19:40,630 --> 01:19:43,060
It doesn't exist right now,
but if that did happen,

1437
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:48,450
if someone did come to the UN and had 
this multistage presentation data that 

1438
01:19:50,531 --> 01:19:53,260
showed that if we continue on the path 
we're going,

1439
01:19:53,261 --> 01:19:58,261
we have seven years before artificial 
intelligence decides to eliminate human 

1440
01:19:58,261 --> 01:19:59,380
beings based on these data points.

1441
01:20:00,290 --> 01:20:01,180
What do you.
What do they do?

1442
01:20:01,181 --> 01:20:02,740
What are the Boston Dynamics?
People do?

1443
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,420
Well,
I'm building a house in Cambridge.

1444
01:20:04,421 --> 01:20:05,470
What are you talking about?
Man?

1445
01:20:05,910 --> 01:20:07,920
I'm not going anywhere.
Come on.

1446
01:20:07,921 --> 01:20:10,230
I just bought a new tesla.
I need to finance this thing.

1447
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:11,770
Hey,
younger credit card bills.

1448
01:20:11,771 --> 01:20:13,530
I got student loans.
I'm still paying off.

1449
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:18,590
Like what?
How do you stop people from doing what 

1450
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:18,660
they do for a living?
How do you say that?

1451
01:20:18,661 --> 01:20:23,661
Hey,
I know that you would like to look at 

1452
01:20:23,661 --> 01:20:26,480
the future with rose colored glasses on,
but there's a real potential pitfall 

1453
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,980
that could be the extermination of the 
human species.

1454
01:20:29,070 --> 01:20:34,070
Right,
and obviously I'm going way far with 

1455
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:34,070
this.

1456
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:34,070
Yeah,
I like it.

1457
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:39,710
I think every one of us trying to build 
these systems are similar in sound to 

1458
01:20:41,131 --> 01:20:46,131
the way you were talking about the touch
of death in that my dream and the dream 

1459
01:20:47,341 --> 01:20:52,341
of many roboticist is to create 
intelligent systems that will improve 

1460
01:20:52,411 --> 01:20:57,411
our lives and working really hard at it.
Not for our house in Cambridge,

1461
01:20:59,190 --> 01:21:03,720
not for a billion dollar,
for selling a startup paycheck.

1462
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:05,310
We love this stuff.

1463
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:10,410
Some of you.
So obviously the motivations are 

1464
01:21:10,410 --> 01:21:11,860
different for every single human being 
that's involved in every endeavor.

1465
01:21:11,990 --> 01:21:16,990
So,
and we're trying really hard to build 

1466
01:21:16,990 --> 01:21:18,550
these systems and is really hard.
So whenever the,

1467
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,450
the question is,
well,

1468
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:22,790
this is going to look at it 
historically,

1469
01:21:22,791 --> 01:21:26,120
it's going to take off.
It can potentially take off any moment.

1470
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:31,540
It's very difficult to really be 
cognizant as an engineer about how it 

1471
01:21:33,291 --> 01:21:38,291
takes off because you're trying to make 
it take off in a positive direction and 

1472
01:21:38,291 --> 01:21:40,340
you're failing.
Everybody is failing.

1473
01:21:40,341 --> 01:21:45,341
It's been really hard.
And so you have to acknowledge that 

1474
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:47,990
there,
that overnight,

1475
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:53,060
some Ilan Musk type character might come
along and you know,

1476
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,550
people with this boring company,
uh,

1477
01:21:55,551 --> 01:22:00,551
or with space x,
people didn't think anybody but NASA 

1478
01:22:00,551 --> 01:22:00,800
could do what he's doing and he's doing 
it.

1479
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,270
It's hard to think about that too much.
You have to do that.

1480
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:10,600
But the reality is we're trying to 
create these super intelligent beings.

1481
01:22:11,710 --> 01:22:16,710
Sure,
but isn't the reality also that we have 

1482
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:16,990
done things in the past because we were 
trying to do it.

1483
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:20,860
And then we realized that these have 
horrific consequences for the human race

1484
01:22:21,070 --> 01:22:23,440
like Oppenheimer and the Manhattan 
project.

1485
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:24,730
You know,
when he said,

1486
01:22:25,030 --> 01:22:28,360
I am death destroy one destroyer of 
worlds.

1487
01:22:28,361 --> 01:22:30,340
When,
when he was quoting the Bhagavad Gita,

1488
01:22:30,670 --> 01:22:34,660
when he's detonating the first nuclear 
bomb and realizing what he's done,

1489
01:22:35,110 --> 01:22:40,110
just because something's possible to do 
doesn't necessarily mean it's a good 

1490
01:22:40,110 --> 01:22:43,471
idea for human beings to do it.
Now we haven't destroyed the world with 

1491
01:22:43,471 --> 01:22:45,910
Oppenheimer's discovery and through the 
work of the Manhattan project,

1492
01:22:45,911 --> 01:22:50,911
we've managed to somehow or another keep
the lid on this shit for the last 

1493
01:22:50,911 --> 01:22:50,911
incredible.
It's crazy,

1494
01:22:50,911 --> 01:22:52,000
right?
You know,

1495
01:22:52,001 --> 01:22:53,470
I mean for the last,
what,

1496
01:22:53,471 --> 01:22:55,210
70 years,
how long has it been?

1497
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:56,550
Seven days.
Sounds right.

1498
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:57,950
$10,000.
$20,000.

1499
01:22:57,951 --> 01:23:00,220
Nukes all over the world right now.
It's crazy.

1500
01:23:00,221 --> 01:23:05,221
I mean,
we literally could kill everything on 

1501
01:23:05,221 --> 01:23:05,500
the planet and somehow we would not 
somehow,

1502
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:09,460
somehow in some amazing way we have not,
but that doesn't mean we.

1503
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:14,540
I mean this a very short amount of time 
in relation to the actual lifespan of 

1504
01:23:15,821 --> 01:23:20,821
the earth itself and certainly in terms 
of the time human history has been 

1505
01:23:20,821 --> 01:23:20,821
around

1506
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:26,300
and nuclear weapons.
Global warming is another one.

1507
01:23:27,190 --> 01:23:29,230
Sure.
But that's a side effect of our actions,

1508
01:23:29,231 --> 01:23:34,231
right?
We're talking about a direct effect of 

1509
01:23:34,231 --> 01:23:35,800
human ingenuity and innovation.
The nuclear bomb,

1510
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:38,590
it's a direct effect.
We tried to make it,

1511
01:23:38,591 --> 01:23:39,870
we made it.
There it goes.

1512
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:43,600
Global warming's an accidental 
consequence of human civilization,

1513
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:49,650
so you can't.
I don't think it's possible to not build

1514
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:50,710
a nuclear bomb.

1515
01:23:51,670 --> 01:23:54,610
You don't think it's possible to not 
build it in terms of.

1516
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:56,890
Because people are tribal,
they speak different languages,

1517
01:23:56,891 --> 01:23:59,830
they have different desires and needs 
and they were add more.

1518
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:02,380
So if all these engineers were working 
towards it,

1519
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:04,780
it was not possible to not build it.

1520
01:24:05,130 --> 01:24:05,750
Yep.
And the,

1521
01:24:06,390 --> 01:24:11,390
like I said,
there's something about us chimps in a 

1522
01:24:11,390 --> 01:24:11,520
large collective where we,
uh,

1523
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:14,970
are born and push forward towards 
progress of technology.

1524
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:17,760
You cannot stop the progress of 
technology.

1525
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:23,000
So the goal is to how to develop,
how to guide that development into a 

1526
01:24:23,131 --> 01:24:23,970
positive direction.

1527
01:24:24,290 --> 01:24:29,290
Surely if we do understand that this has
taken place and we did drop these 

1528
01:24:30,260 --> 01:24:35,260
enormous bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
and killed untold amounts of innocent 

1529
01:24:36,891 --> 01:24:41,891
people with these detonations that it's 
not necessarily always a good thing to 

1530
01:24:43,101 --> 01:24:44,270
pursue technology

1531
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:46,410
it.
Nobody is.

1532
01:24:46,530 --> 01:24:47,070
So

1533
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:51,030
you see what I'm saying?
I agree with your total.

1534
01:24:51,190 --> 01:24:53,510
I'm more playing devil's advocate than 
anything,

1535
01:24:53,830 --> 01:24:58,830
but what I'm,
what I'm saying is you guys are looking 

1536
01:24:58,830 --> 01:25:01,031
at these things like we're just trying 
to make these things happen and what I 

1537
01:25:01,031 --> 01:25:04,871
think people like Elon Musk and Sam 
Harris and a bunch of others that are 

1538
01:25:04,871 --> 01:25:08,770
gravely concerned about the potential 
for ai are saying is that I understand 

1539
01:25:09,351 --> 01:25:14,351
what you're doing,
but you've got to understand the other 

1540
01:25:14,351 --> 01:25:17,411
side of it.
You've got to understand that there are 

1541
01:25:17,411 --> 01:25:17,420
people out there that are terrified,
that if you do extrapolate,

1542
01:25:17,421 --> 01:25:22,421
if you do take this relentless thirst 
for innovation and keep going with it,

1543
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:29,010
when you look at what we can do so what 
human beings can do so far in our crude 

1544
01:25:29,331 --> 01:25:34,040
manner of 2018 will all the amazing 
things they've been able to accomplish.

1545
01:25:34,550 --> 01:25:38,630
It's entirely possible that we might be 
creating our successors.

1546
01:25:38,690 --> 01:25:43,690
This is not outside the realm of 
possibility and all of our biological 

1547
01:25:43,690 --> 01:25:47,351
limitations might be we,
we might figure out a better way and 

1548
01:25:47,351 --> 01:25:50,570
this better way might be some sort of an
artificial creature.

1549
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:56,380
Yep.
Ai began with our dream to forge the 

1550
01:25:56,380 --> 01:25:59,141
gods and that's I would like.
I think that it's impossible to stop.

1551
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:05,920
Well,
it's impossible to stop if you go Ted 

1552
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:06,290
Kaczynski and kill all the people.
I mean,

1553
01:26:06,291 --> 01:26:08,870
that's what Ted Kaczynski anticipated.
No,

1554
01:26:08,871 --> 01:26:12,170
the unibomber,
you know the whole story behind him know

1555
01:26:12,171 --> 01:26:14,720
what was he trying to stop who?
He's a fascinating cat.

1556
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:19,750
Here's what's fascinating.
It was a bunch of fascinating things 

1557
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:21,851
about him,
but one of the more fascinating things 

1558
01:26:21,851 --> 01:26:23,561
about him,
he was involved in the Harvard lsd 

1559
01:26:23,561 --> 01:26:26,201
studies,
so they were nuke in that dude's brain 

1560
01:26:26,201 --> 01:26:27,830
with acid and then he goes to Berkeley,
becomes a professor,

1561
01:26:27,831 --> 01:26:32,831
takes all this money from teaching and 
just makes a cabin in the woods and 

1562
01:26:32,831 --> 01:26:36,110
decides to kill people that are involved
in the creation of technology because he

1563
01:26:36,111 --> 01:26:39,050
thinks technology is eventually going to
kill off all the people.

1564
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:44,440
So he becomes crazy and schizophrenia 
pick and who knows what the fuck is 

1565
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:47,480
wrong with them and whether or not this 
would have taken place inevitably,

1566
01:26:47,630 --> 01:26:52,630
or whether this was a direct result of 
his being literally like drowned in Lsd.

1567
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:58,450
We don't even know how much they gave 
him or what the experiment entailed or 

1568
01:26:58,450 --> 01:27:00,280
how many other people's gut,
their brain torched during these uh,

1569
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:05,380
experiments.
But we do know for a fact that Ted 

1570
01:27:05,380 --> 01:27:05,380
Kaczynski was a part of the Harvard lsd 
studies.

1571
01:27:05,810 --> 01:27:10,810
And we do know that he went and did move
to the woods and write his manifesto and

1572
01:27:11,781 --> 01:27:14,960
start blowing up people that were 
involved in technology.

1573
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:20,110
And the basic thesis of his manifesto 
that perhaps Lsd,

1574
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,940
he opened his eyes to,
is that technology is gonna,

1575
01:27:23,330 --> 01:27:25,790
kill all humans.
And so we should.

1576
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,260
It was gonna be the end of the human 
race,

1577
01:27:27,261 --> 01:27:32,261
I think you may believe human race.
So they know what it is that what he 

1578
01:27:32,261 --> 01:27:32,890
said.
You will get into industrial,

1579
01:27:32,891 --> 01:27:33,920
Rachel,
excuse me,

1580
01:27:33,970 --> 01:27:38,970
the industrial revolution and its 
consequences have been a disaster for 

1581
01:27:38,970 --> 01:27:38,970
the human race.

1582
01:27:38,970 --> 01:27:40,090
Yeah.
He extrapolated.

1583
01:27:40,330 --> 01:27:45,330
He was looking at where we're going and 
these people that were responsible for 

1584
01:27:45,330 --> 01:27:49,411
innovation and he was saying they're 
doing this with no regard for the 

1585
01:27:49,411 --> 01:27:52,681
consequences on the human race.
And he thought the way to stop that was 

1586
01:27:52,681 --> 01:27:54,190
to kill people.
Obviously he's fucking demented,

1587
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:59,700
but this is.
I mean he literally was saying what 

1588
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:01,630
we're saying right now.
You keep going,

1589
01:28:01,631 --> 01:28:02,350
we're fucked.

1590
01:28:02,770 --> 01:28:06,090
So the industrial revolution have to 
think about that.

1591
01:28:06,110 --> 01:28:08,500
It's a really important message coming 
from the wrong guy.

1592
01:28:08,501 --> 01:28:12,790
But where is it?
Where's all of this?

1593
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:13,930
Taking us?
Yeah.

1594
01:28:13,931 --> 01:28:18,931
Where is it taste?
So I guess my underlying assumption is 

1595
01:28:18,931 --> 01:28:22,801
the journey,
the current capitalist structure of 

1596
01:28:22,801 --> 01:28:25,081
society that we always want a new iphone
just had a one of the best reviewers on 

1597
01:28:26,411 --> 01:28:28,750
yesterday that always talks about 
Marcus.

1598
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:29,400
Marcus.
Yeah.

1599
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:32,890
We always myself to pixel three.
I have a pixel to.

1600
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:33,870
I'm thinking,
man,

1601
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:37,330
maybe I needed a pixel three.
I don't know a better camera.

1602
01:28:37,370 --> 01:28:41,380
You know that whatever that is,
that fire that wants more butter,

1603
01:28:41,381 --> 01:28:46,381
butter.
I just don't think it's possible to 

1604
01:28:46,381 --> 01:28:49,111
stop.
And the best thing we can do is to 

1605
01:28:49,111 --> 01:28:51,790
explore ways to guided towards safety 
where it helps us.

1606
01:28:51,970 --> 01:28:55,840
When you say it's not possible to stop 
you mean collectively as an organism,

1607
01:28:55,841 --> 01:29:00,841
like the human race,
that it's a tendency that's just built 

1608
01:29:00,841 --> 01:29:03,271
in.
It's certainly possible stop as an 

1609
01:29:03,271 --> 01:29:05,551
individual because I know people like my
friend Ari who's given up on 

1610
01:29:05,551 --> 01:29:09,450
smartphones,
he went to a flip phone and he doesn't 

1611
01:29:09,450 --> 01:29:10,470
check social media anymore and he found 
it to be toxic.

1612
01:29:10,471 --> 01:29:13,440
He didn't like it.
He thought it was too addicted to it and

1613
01:29:13,441 --> 01:29:15,360
he didn't like where it was leading him.
Yup.

1614
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:17,580
So in front.
On an individual level,

1615
01:29:17,581 --> 01:29:18,060
it's possible

1616
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:23,420
individual level,
but then and just like with Ted 

1617
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:27,500
Kaczynski and the individual level,
it's possible to do certain things that 

1618
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:29,250
tried to stop at a more dramatic ways,
but I just think the force of our.

1619
01:29:29,260 --> 01:29:33,120
This symbiotic,
this organism that's just this living,

1620
01:29:33,121 --> 01:29:36,600
breathing organism that is our 
civilization will progress forward.

1621
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:39,240
We're just curious apes,
it's,

1622
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:43,110
it's this desire to explore the 
universe.

1623
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:45,600
Why?
Why do we want to do these things?

1624
01:29:45,601 --> 01:29:50,130
Why do we look up and we want to travel 
and and it's not.

1625
01:29:50,131 --> 01:29:53,820
I don't think it's sort of a.
we're trying to optimize for survival.

1626
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:59,000
In fact,
I don't think most of us would want to 

1627
01:29:59,000 --> 01:29:59,000
be immortal.
The,

1628
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,400
I think it's like Neil degrasse Tyson 
talks about the fact that we're mortal.

1629
01:30:02,401 --> 01:30:07,401
The fact that one day we'll die is one 
of the things that gives life meaning 

1630
01:30:07,401 --> 01:30:10,710
and sort of trying to worry and trying 
to sort of say,

1631
01:30:10,711 --> 01:30:12,150
wait a minute,
where's this going?

1632
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:17,420
As opposed to riding the wave and doing,
riding the wave of,

1633
01:30:18,090 --> 01:30:20,150
of forward progress.
I mean,

1634
01:30:20,151 --> 01:30:22,920
it's one of the things he gets quite a 
bit of.

1635
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:27,950
Ironically hate for Steve Pinker,
but he really described in data how our 

1636
01:30:27,950 --> 01:30:28,800
world is getting better and better with

1637
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:34,500
hate from people that don't want to 
admit that there's a trend towards 

1638
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:38,230
things getting better because they feel 
like then people will ignore all the bad

1639
01:30:38,231 --> 01:30:43,231
things that are happening right now and 
all the injustices which I think is a 

1640
01:30:43,231 --> 01:30:44,020
very short sided thing,
but I think it's because of their own,

1641
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:49,740
their own biases and the perspective 
that they're trying to establish and 

1642
01:30:49,740 --> 01:30:54,721
push instead of looking at things,
objectives and looking at the date and 

1643
01:30:54,721 --> 01:30:54,721
say,
say,

1644
01:30:54,721 --> 01:30:58,951
I see where you're going.
It doesn't discount the fact that 

1645
01:30:58,951 --> 01:31:01,411
there's injustice in the world and crime
and violence and all sorts of terrible 

1646
01:31:01,411 --> 01:31:02,350
things happen to people that are good 
people on a daily basis,

1647
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:07,890
but what he's saying is just look at the
actual trend of civilization and the 

1648
01:31:08,621 --> 01:31:13,621
human species itself,
and there's an undeniable trend towards 

1649
01:31:13,621 --> 01:31:16,510
peace.
Slowly but surely working towards peace.

1650
01:31:16,780 --> 01:31:21,780
Way Safer today.
Way Safer today than it was a thousand 

1651
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:21,780
years ago.
Just it is.

1652
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:22,050
It just did.

1653
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:27,240
Yeah,
and there's these interesting arguments 

1654
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:28,870
which his book kind of blew my mind to 
this funny joke.

1655
01:31:28,871 --> 01:31:31,690
He says,
some people considered given nuclear,

1656
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:37,390
the atom bomb the Nobel Peace Prize 
because he believes I'm not an expert in

1657
01:31:38,141 --> 01:31:43,141
this at all,
but he believes that sort of or some 

1658
01:31:43,141 --> 01:31:44,971
people believe that nuclear weapons are 
actually responsible for a lot of the 

1659
01:31:44,971 --> 01:31:47,830
decrease in violence because all of the 
major people can do damage.

1660
01:31:47,831 --> 01:31:51,280
All the Russia and all the major states.
Could you do damage,

1661
01:31:51,460 --> 01:31:54,720
have a strong disincentive from engaging
in warfare.

1662
01:31:55,090 --> 01:31:57,270
And so these are the kinds of things you
don't,

1663
01:31:57,510 --> 01:31:59,450
I guess,
anticipate and say.

1664
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:04,680
So I think it's,
it's very difficult to stop that for 

1665
01:32:05,151 --> 01:32:10,151
progress,
but we have to really worry and think 

1666
01:32:10,151 --> 01:32:10,151
about,
okay,

1667
01:32:10,151 --> 01:32:11,470
how do we avoid the list of things that 
we worry about?

1668
01:32:11,890 --> 01:32:16,890
So one of the things that people really 
worry about is the control problem is 

1669
01:32:16,890 --> 01:32:20,851
basically ai becoming,
not necessarily super intelligent but 

1670
01:32:20,851 --> 01:32:22,570
super powerful,
but too much of our lives into it.

1671
01:32:22,990 --> 01:32:27,990
That's where Elon Musk and others,
they want to provide regulation of some 

1672
01:32:27,990 --> 01:32:27,990
sort saying,
wait a minute,

1673
01:32:28,630 --> 01:32:33,630
you have to put some bars on what this 
thing can do from a government 

1674
01:32:33,630 --> 01:32:33,630
perspective,
from a company perspective,

1675
01:32:33,630 --> 01:32:34,010
right?
But how

1676
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:36,560
could you stop rogue states from doing 
that?

1677
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:38,210
How could you,
why would you,

1678
01:32:38,211 --> 01:32:40,940
why would China listen to us?
Why would Russia listen to us?

1679
01:32:40,941 --> 01:32:45,941
Why would other countries that are 
capable of doing this and maybe don't 

1680
01:32:45,941 --> 01:32:47,960
have the same sort of power that the 
United States has and they would like to

1681
01:32:47,961 --> 01:32:51,680
establish that kind of power.
Why wouldn't they just take the cap off

1682
01:32:53,020 --> 01:32:55,150
in philosophical,
high level sense?

1683
01:32:55,180 --> 01:32:57,610
There's no reason.
But if you engineered in.

1684
01:32:58,030 --> 01:33:03,030
So I'm a big,
we'll do this thing with autonomous 

1685
01:33:03,030 --> 01:33:06,511
vehicles called arguing machines.
We have multiple AI systems argue 

1686
01:33:06,511 --> 01:33:07,640
against each other.
So it's,

1687
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:12,740
it's possible that you'll have some ai 
systems over supervising other AI 

1688
01:33:12,881 --> 01:33:15,420
systems.
So have a sort of,

1689
01:33:15,421 --> 01:33:16,120
uh,
like,

1690
01:33:16,121 --> 01:33:16,900
uh,
in our,

1691
01:33:16,901 --> 01:33:19,390
in our nation there's a congress 
arguing,

1692
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:24,640
blue and red states being represented in
as this discourse going on debate and 

1693
01:33:25,031 --> 01:33:30,031
have ai systems like that too.
It doesn't even necessarily need to be 

1694
01:33:30,031 --> 01:33:32,620
one super powerful thing.
It could be ai supervising each other,

1695
01:33:32,950 --> 01:33:37,950
so there's this interesting ideas there 
too to play with because ultimately what

1696
01:33:38,711 --> 01:33:40,840
are these artificial intelligence 
systems doing?

1697
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:45,520
We humans place power into their hands 
first in order for them to run away with

1698
01:33:45,521 --> 01:33:47,800
it.
We need to put power into their hands,

1699
01:33:48,010 --> 01:33:53,010
so we'll have to figure out how we put 
that power in initially so it doesn't 

1700
01:33:53,010 --> 01:33:53,650
run away and how supervision can happen.
Right,

1701
01:33:53,651 --> 01:33:54,140
but this is

1702
01:33:54,210 --> 01:33:56,550
us.
You're talking about rational people.

1703
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:59,720
What about other people?
Why would they engineer limitations into

1704
01:33:59,721 --> 01:34:04,721
their artificial intelligence and what 
incentive would they have to do that to 

1705
01:34:04,721 --> 01:34:08,451
somehow another limit their artificial 
intelligence to keep it from having as 

1706
01:34:08,451 --> 01:34:10,410
much power as ours.
There's really not a lot of incentive on

1707
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:15,420
their side,
especially if there's some sort of 

1708
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:17,751
competitive advantage for their 
artificial intelligence to be more 

1709
01:34:17,751 --> 01:34:17,751
ruthless,
more sentient,

1710
01:34:17,751 --> 01:34:19,450
more autonomous.
I mean it's.

1711
01:34:19,470 --> 01:34:23,640
It seems like once again,
once the genie's out of the bottle,

1712
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:26,580
it's going to be very hard.
I have a theory,

1713
01:34:26,730 --> 01:34:31,730
and this is a very bizarre theory,
but I've been running with this for 

1714
01:34:31,730 --> 01:34:34,880
quite a few years now.
I think human beings are some sort of a 

1715
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:37,731
caterpillar and I think we're creating a
cocoon and through that cocoon we're 

1716
01:34:37,731 --> 01:34:40,560
going to give birth to a butterfly and 
then we're going to become something and

1717
01:34:40,561 --> 01:34:44,760
I think we're whether we're going to 
have some sort of a symbiotic connection

1718
01:34:44,761 --> 01:34:47,060
to these electronic things where they're
going to replace our.

1719
01:34:47,310 --> 01:34:52,310
Our parts are failing parts with far 
superior parts until we're not really a 

1720
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:56,751
person anymore.
Like what was that scarlet Johannson 

1721
01:34:56,751 --> 01:34:56,820
movie?
The ghost in the shell.

1722
01:34:57,530 --> 01:34:59,270
I tried to watch part of it.
It's pretty stupid,

1723
01:34:59,630 --> 01:35:04,630
but she's hot as fuck,
so it kept my attention for a little 

1724
01:35:04,630 --> 01:35:07,271
bit,
but in that they took her brain and put 

1725
01:35:07,271 --> 01:35:10,301
it in this artificial body that was like
had super powers and they basically 

1726
01:35:10,941 --> 01:35:15,941
replaced everything about her.
That wasn't her consciousness with these

1727
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:20,330
artificial parts,
the Gerd,

1728
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:25,390
oliver frame,
everything was just some new thing that 

1729
01:35:25,390 --> 01:35:29,471
was far superior and she had these 
abilities that no human being will ever 

1730
01:35:29,471 --> 01:35:33,221
have.
I really wonder why we have this 

1731
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:34,880
insatiable thirst.
Why can't we,

1732
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:39,900
if we're so logical,
we're so logical and so thoughtful in 

1733
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:43,781
some ways.
Why can't we be that way when it comes 

1734
01:35:43,781 --> 01:35:43,781
to materialism?
Well,

1735
01:35:43,781 --> 01:35:47,111
I think one of the reasons why is 
because materialism is the main engine 

1736
01:35:47,330 --> 01:35:48,650
that pushes innovation.

1737
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:51,560
If it wasn't for people's desire to get 
the newest,

1738
01:35:51,561 --> 01:35:56,180
latest and greatest thing,
what would fund these new tvs?

1739
01:35:56,181 --> 01:35:57,740
Cell phones,
computers.

1740
01:35:57,741 --> 01:36:02,741
Well,
why do you really need a new laptop 

1741
01:36:02,741 --> 01:36:02,741
every year?
Is it because of engineered obsolescence

1742
01:36:02,741 --> 01:36:06,320
where the laptop dies off and you have 
to get a new one because they fucked you

1743
01:36:06,321 --> 01:36:09,110
and they built a shitty machine that's 
designed to die.

1744
01:36:09,111 --> 01:36:11,550
So you buy a new one.
Really like iphone is done.

1745
01:36:11,551 --> 01:36:12,260
You.
Well,

1746
01:36:12,261 --> 01:36:13,760
it's not even an iphone.
So laptop.

1747
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:14,890
Well,
it is.

1748
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:18,440
It is it because you're,
you know,

1749
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:23,120
you just see the number two point six 
Gigahertz is better than two point four.

1750
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:24,320
Oh,
it's the new one.

1751
01:36:24,321 --> 01:36:27,770
It has a 12 megapixel webcam instead of 
an eight,

1752
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:32,030
and for whatever reason we have this 
desire to get those new things.

1753
01:36:32,570 --> 01:36:37,570
I think that's what fuels innovation and
in my cynical view of this thing that's 

1754
01:36:38,811 --> 01:36:43,811
happening is that we have this bizarre 
desire to fuel our demise and that we're

1755
01:36:45,531 --> 01:36:49,130
doing so by fueling technology,
by,

1756
01:36:49,190 --> 01:36:53,390
by motivating these companies to 
continually innovate,

1757
01:36:53,510 --> 01:36:54,970
know if everybody just said,
you know what,

1758
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:59,980
man,
I'm really in the log cabins and I want 

1759
01:36:59,980 --> 01:36:59,980
to,
uh,

1760
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:00,350
an ax or cut my own firewood.

1761
01:37:00,620 --> 01:37:04,910
And I realized that TV's rot my brain.
I just want to read books so fuck off.

1762
01:37:05,090 --> 01:37:07,870
And everybody started doing that and 
everybody started living in like,

1763
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:10,880
when it gets dark out,
I'll use candles and you know what?

1764
01:37:10,881 --> 01:37:13,550
I'm going to get my water from a well 
and you know what I'm going to do.

1765
01:37:13,610 --> 01:37:17,150
And I like living better that way.
If people started doing that,

1766
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:22,660
there would be no need for companies to 
continually make new computers to make 

1767
01:37:22,660 --> 01:37:25,700
new phones,
to make new smartwatches or whatever the

1768
01:37:25,701 --> 01:37:28,130
fuck they're they're making to make cars
that can drive themselves.

1769
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:31,820
These things that were,
that were really,

1770
01:37:31,821 --> 01:37:35,570
really attached to.
If you looked at the human organism,

1771
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:40,640
you're like,
you've somehow or another could 

1772
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:41,751
objective really remove yourself from 
society and culture and all the things 

1773
01:37:43,161 --> 01:37:46,070
that make us a person and you look at 
what we do,

1774
01:37:46,180 --> 01:37:48,560
like what does this thing do?
We found this planet,

1775
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:52,190
there's these little pink monkeys and 
brown monkeys and yellow monkeys,

1776
01:37:52,370 --> 01:37:53,750
and what do they all into?
Well,

1777
01:37:53,751 --> 01:37:57,480
they all seem to be into making stuff 
and what kind of stuff were they making?

1778
01:37:57,660 --> 01:38:02,660
Well,
they keep making better and better 

1779
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:02,660
stuff.
That's more and more capable.

1780
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:02,660
Well,
where's it going?

1781
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:06,620
What's going to replace them?
They're going to make a thing that's 

1782
01:38:06,620 --> 01:38:06,620
better than them.
They're going to their,

1783
01:38:06,620 --> 01:38:07,650
their engineering.
These things.

1784
01:38:07,651 --> 01:38:11,040
Slowly but surely to do all the things 
they do,

1785
01:38:11,190 --> 01:38:12,060
but do them better.

1786
01:38:12,870 --> 01:38:15,720
Yeah,
and it's a fascinating theory.

1787
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:17,460
I mean it's,
it's not a theory.

1788
01:38:17,461 --> 01:38:22,461
It's,
it's an instructive way to think about 

1789
01:38:22,461 --> 01:38:22,590
intelligence in life period.
So if you step back,

1790
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:27,980
look across human history and look at 
earth is an organism like what is this 

1791
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:29,160
thing doing?
The thing is,

1792
01:38:29,161 --> 01:38:30,330
I think at,
at,

1793
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:34,290
in terms of scale and in terms of time,
you can look that way.

1794
01:38:34,291 --> 01:38:39,291
It's so many things like isn't there 
billions or trillions of organisms on 

1795
01:38:39,291 --> 01:38:40,700
our skin right now,
both of us that are,

1796
01:38:40,710 --> 01:38:42,450
have little civilizations,
right?

1797
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:45,630
They have a different mechanism by which
they operate and interact.

1798
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:51,080
But for us to say that we're intelligent
and those organisms or not is a very 

1799
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:55,311
narrow sighted view.
So they are operating under some force 

1800
01:38:55,311 --> 01:38:55,710
of nature that,
uh,

1801
01:38:55,711 --> 01:39:00,711
that the Darwin has worked on trying to 
understand some small elements of this 

1802
01:39:00,711 --> 01:39:01,170
evolutionary theory.

1803
01:39:01,170 --> 01:39:04,530
But there's other more interesting 
forces at play that we don't understand.

1804
01:39:04,890 --> 01:39:09,890
And there's some kind of force.
It could be a fundamental force of 

1805
01:39:09,890 --> 01:39:13,701
physics that Einstein never got a chance
to discover is our desire for an iphone 

1806
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:18,780
update some,
some fundamental force of nature.

1807
01:39:19,090 --> 01:39:23,190
Somehow gravity in the strong force in 
these things described by physics add up

1808
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:28,580
to this drive for new things,
for creation.

1809
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:31,950
And uh,
the fact that we die,

1810
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:35,760
the,
that the fact that we're mortal.

1811
01:39:35,910 --> 01:39:39,810
The fact that what desires a built in to
us,

1812
01:39:39,870 --> 01:39:43,500
whether it's a sexual or intellectual or
whatever drives us,

1813
01:39:43,501 --> 01:39:46,470
apes like somehow that all combines to 
this,

1814
01:39:47,460 --> 01:39:52,460
to this progress and towards what it is 
a compelling way to think that if an 

1815
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:57,171
alien species did visit Earth,
I think they would probably see the 

1816
01:39:57,171 --> 01:40:01,581
smartphone situation.
They see how many little lights are on 

1817
01:40:01,581 --> 01:40:03,300
and how us apes are looking at them.
It's possible.

1818
01:40:03,301 --> 01:40:08,301
I think some people have said that they 
would think the overlords are the 

1819
01:40:08,301 --> 01:40:08,301
phones,
not the people.

1820
01:40:08,490 --> 01:40:13,490
So to think that that's now moving into 
a direction where the future will be 

1821
01:40:14,011 --> 01:40:18,630
something that is beyond human or survey
article.

1822
01:40:18,660 --> 01:40:22,890
Human ways we can't understand it is 
really interesting.

1823
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:23,440
Not just that,

1824
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:25,360
but something that we're creating 
ourselves,

1825
01:40:25,370 --> 01:40:26,530
grading ourselves,
and it's a,

1826
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:31,420
a main focal point of our existence.
That's our purpose.

1827
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:32,110
Yeah.
I mean,

1828
01:40:32,111 --> 01:40:35,730
if you think about a main focal point,
if you think about the,

1829
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:38,200
uh,
the average person,

1830
01:40:38,201 --> 01:40:43,201
what they do,
there's a great percentage of our 

1831
01:40:43,201 --> 01:40:47,101
population that has jobs where they work
and one of the ways that they placate 

1832
01:40:48,371 --> 01:40:53,371
themselves doing these things that they 
don't really enjoy doing is earning 

1833
01:40:53,371 --> 01:40:54,600
money for.
Right?

1834
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:57,370
They want a new car,
they want a new house,

1835
01:40:57,371 --> 01:40:59,950
they want a bigger TV.
They wanted this or that.

1836
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:05,160
And the way they motivate themselves to 
keep showing up at this shitty job is to

1837
01:41:05,351 --> 01:41:08,440
think if I just put in three more 
months,

1838
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:12,310
I can get that Mercedes.
If I just do this or that or that,

1839
01:41:12,370 --> 01:41:12,970
I can,
oh,

1840
01:41:12,971 --> 01:41:14,560
I can finance this new pixel

1841
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:16,430
three.
Oh yeah.

1842
01:41:16,431 --> 01:41:20,420
And it's interesting because it's sort 
of politicians,

1843
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:23,330
what's the American dream is for you 
here?

1844
01:41:23,331 --> 01:41:25,580
This thing,
I want my children to be better off than

1845
01:41:25,581 --> 01:41:27,480
me.
It's kind of desire,

1846
01:41:27,650 --> 01:41:32,650
you know,
you can almost see that that taken 

1847
01:41:32,650 --> 01:41:34,110
farther and farther will be.
There'll be a presidential candidate and

1848
01:41:34,220 --> 01:41:35,750
5,000
years they'll say,

1849
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:40,890
I want my children to be robots.
And you know what I mean?

1850
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:45,900
Like sort of this idea that that's the 
natural evolution and that is the 

1851
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:50,771
highest calling of our species.
That scares me because I value my own 

1852
01:41:50,771 --> 01:41:51,910
life,
but does it

1853
01:41:52,050 --> 01:41:57,050
Gary you if if it comes out perfect.
Like if each robot is like a god in each

1854
01:41:58,081 --> 01:42:03,081
robot is beautiful and loving and they 
they recognize all the great parts of 

1855
01:42:03,081 --> 01:42:07,461
this existence and they avoid all the 
jealousy and the nonsense and all the 

1856
01:42:07,461 --> 01:42:12,071
stupid aspects of being a person.
We realized that a lot of these things 

1857
01:42:12,071 --> 01:42:15,171
are just sort of biological engineered 
tricks that are designed to keep us 

1858
01:42:15,691 --> 01:42:17,970
surviving from generation after 
generation,

1859
01:42:17,971 --> 01:42:22,620
but now here in this fantastic new age,
we don't need them anymore.

1860
01:42:23,540 --> 01:42:24,500
Yeah,
it's.

1861
01:42:25,340 --> 01:42:30,340
Well first one of the most 
transformative moments of my life was 

1862
01:42:30,340 --> 01:42:35,051
when I met spot many in person,
which is one of the legged robots in 

1863
01:42:35,051 --> 01:42:37,100
Boston dynamics for the first time when 
I met them,

1864
01:42:38,290 --> 01:42:42,860
my meant that little fella there was.
I know exactly how it works.

1865
01:42:43,370 --> 01:42:45,230
I know exactly how every aspect of it 
works.

1866
01:42:45,260 --> 01:42:50,260
It's just a dumb robot.
But when I met him and he got up and he 

1867
01:42:50,260 --> 01:42:51,140
looked at me,
there it is right there.

1868
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:53,480
Have you seen a dance now?
Yeah.

1869
01:42:53,510 --> 01:42:57,800
The dance.
The dance is crazy.

1870
01:42:58,440 --> 01:42:59,660
It's.
I see.

1871
01:42:59,750 --> 01:43:03,140
It's not crazy on the technical side.
It's engineered.

1872
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:04,820
It's obvious.
It's programmed,

1873
01:43:04,821 --> 01:43:06,770
but it's crazy to watch like,
wow,

1874
01:43:06,830 --> 01:43:11,830
there's something.
The reason that moment was 

1875
01:43:11,830 --> 01:43:13,721
transformative because I know exactly 
how it works and yet by watching it 

1876
01:43:13,721 --> 01:43:15,050
something about the feeling of it,
you're like,

1877
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:20,080
this thing is alive and there was this 
terrifying moment.

1878
01:43:20,210 --> 01:43:22,340
Not Terrifying,
terrifying and appealing.

1879
01:43:22,490 --> 01:43:25,140
Where this is the future,
right?

1880
01:43:25,610 --> 01:43:30,610
Like this thing,
like this thing represents some future 

1881
01:43:31,821 --> 01:43:36,470
that is totally that we don't cannot 
understand.

1882
01:43:36,770 --> 01:43:41,770
Just like a future in the 18th century 
of a future with planes and smartphones 

1883
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:45,140
with somebody who could understand that 
this thing,

1884
01:43:45,410 --> 01:43:50,030
that little dog could have had a a human
consciousness in it.

1885
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:53,270
That was the feeling had.
And I know exactly how it works.

1886
01:43:53,271 --> 01:43:55,040
There's nothing close to the 
intelligence,

1887
01:43:55,041 --> 01:44:00,041
but it just gives you this picture of 
what the possibilities are of these 

1888
01:44:00,621 --> 01:44:05,621
living creatures and I think that's what
people feel when they see Boston 

1889
01:44:05,621 --> 01:44:08,741
dynamics will call awesome.
This thing running around is they don't 

1890
01:44:08,741 --> 01:44:09,470
care about the technicalities and how 
far away we are.

1891
01:44:09,770 --> 01:44:11,030
They see it.
Look,

1892
01:44:11,031 --> 01:44:16,031
this thing is pretty human and the 
possibilities of human like things that 

1893
01:44:16,031 --> 01:44:20,531
supercede humans and can evolve and 
learn so quickly,

1894
01:44:21,290 --> 01:44:26,290
exponentially fast is this terrifying 
frontier that that really makes us think

1895
01:44:29,370 --> 01:44:30,260
as it did for me.

1896
01:44:30,310 --> 01:44:32,770
Maybe terrifying is a weird word because
when I.

1897
01:44:32,830 --> 01:44:36,240
When I look at it and I'm not a rational
and I look at there's.

1898
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:41,520
There's videos that show the progression
of Boston dynamics robots from several 

1899
01:44:43,810 --> 01:44:46,780
years ago to today what they're capable 
of and it's.

1900
01:44:47,020 --> 01:44:52,020
It is a fascinating thing because you're
watching all the hard work of these 

1901
01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:56,701
engineers and all these people that have
designed these systems and have figured 

1902
01:44:57,761 --> 01:45:02,761
out all of these problems at these 
things encounter and they've come with 

1903
01:45:02,761 --> 01:45:06,301
solutions and they continue to innovate 
and they're constantly doing it and 

1904
01:45:06,301 --> 01:45:06,670
you're seeing this and you're like,
wow,

1905
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:09,310
what are we going to see in a year?
What am I going to see in three years?

1906
01:45:09,311 --> 01:45:14,311
What I want to see in five years?
It's absolutely fascinating because if 

1907
01:45:14,311 --> 01:45:16,510
you extrapolate and you just keep going,
boy,

1908
01:45:16,511 --> 01:45:18,490
you go 15,
20,

1909
01:45:18,491 --> 01:45:19,590
30,
50,

1910
01:45:19,591 --> 01:45:21,850
100 years,
now you have x Mokena

1911
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:23,400
you,
yeah,

1912
01:45:23,401 --> 01:45:28,401
you have x Makkah,
and at least in our imagination and our 

1913
01:45:28,401 --> 01:45:32,511
imagination and the problem is there'll 
be so many other things that are super 

1914
01:45:32,521 --> 01:45:34,050
exciting and interesting,

1915
01:45:35,220 --> 01:45:40,220
but that doesn't mean it's not crazy.
I mean there's many other things you 

1916
01:45:40,220 --> 01:45:42,420
could focus on also that are also going 
to be bizarre and crazy.

1917
01:45:42,660 --> 01:45:45,180
Sure.
But what about it just it?

1918
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:48,360
It's going somewhere.
That fucker is getting better.

1919
01:45:48,700 --> 01:45:53,700
The the park core one is bananas.
You see it hopping from box to box and 

1920
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:55,470
left to right and leaping up in the air 
and you're like,

1921
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:58,410
whoa.
I think doesn't have any wires on it.

1922
01:45:58,950 --> 01:46:03,450
It's not connected to anything.
It's just jumping from box to box.

1923
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:06,570
If that thing had a machine gun,
it was running across a hill at you,

1924
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:08,190
he'd be like,
Oh fuck.

1925
01:46:08,191 --> 01:46:11,220
How long does the battery last said?
How many bullets does it have?

1926
01:46:11,830 --> 01:46:16,830
Let me,
let me just say that I would pick Tim 

1927
01:46:16,940 --> 01:46:19,490
Kennedy over that dog for the next 50 
years.

1928
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:20,920
50.
Yeah,

1929
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:26,540
man.
So I'm a big Tim Kennedy I'm talking 

1930
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:27,660
about.
Um,

1931
01:46:27,770 --> 01:46:32,120
but he'll probably have some robotic 
additions to his body to improve the.

1932
01:46:32,180 --> 01:46:33,920
Well,
is he tim Kennedy anymore?

1933
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:37,850
If the brain is Tim Kennedy,
then he still Tim Kennedy.

1934
01:46:37,851 --> 01:46:42,851
That's the way we think about it.
But there is huge concern about UN is 

1935
01:46:42,851 --> 01:46:45,140
meeting about this autonomous weapons.
It,

1936
01:46:45,530 --> 01:46:46,370
it's,
um,

1937
01:46:47,210 --> 01:46:52,210
it's allowing you to make decisions 
about who lives and who dies is really 

1938
01:46:52,741 --> 01:46:57,741
concerning in the short term.
It's not about a robotic dog with a 

1939
01:46:57,741 --> 01:47:01,851
shotgun running around.
It's more about our military wanting to 

1940
01:47:02,161 --> 01:47:04,710
make destruction as efficient as 
possible,

1941
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:07,680
minimizing human life and drones.
Drones.

1942
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:13,100
There's something really uncomfortable 
to me about drones in how you compare 

1943
01:47:13,170 --> 01:47:13,890
with,
uh,

1944
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:16,860
Dan Carlin hardcore history.
It was the gang Iskcon.

1945
01:47:17,830 --> 01:47:20,430
There's something impersonal about what 
drones are doing,

1946
01:47:20,610 --> 01:47:25,610
weight.
It moves you away from the actual 

1947
01:47:25,610 --> 01:47:28,910
destruction that you're achieving.
Where I worry that our ability to encode

1948
01:47:29,221 --> 01:47:33,780
the ethics into these systems will go 
wrong in ways we don't expect.

1949
01:47:34,590 --> 01:47:37,050
And so,
I mean folks at the UN talk about,

1950
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:39,090
well,
you have these automated,

1951
01:47:39,150 --> 01:47:44,150
so drones that make that drop bombs all 
over a particular area.

1952
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:50,480
So the bigger and bigger the area is 
over which you allow an artificial 

1953
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:52,650
intelligence system to make a decision 
to drop the bombs,

1954
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:58,100
the weirder and weirder it gets.
There's some line that presumably if 

1955
01:47:58,100 --> 01:48:00,390
there's like three tanks that you would 
like to destroy with a drone,

1956
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:04,400
it's okay for ai assistant to say,
I would like to destroy the street.

1957
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:07,020
Like I'll handle everything,
just give me the three tanks.

1958
01:48:07,770 --> 01:48:11,550
But this makes me uncomfortable as well 
because I think,

1959
01:48:12,050 --> 01:48:14,610
uh,
I'm opposed to most wars.

1960
01:48:14,850 --> 01:48:18,720
But it's just military is military and 
they tried to get the job done.

1961
01:48:19,170 --> 01:48:24,170
Now what if we now expand that to 10,
2100 tanks where you not let ai system 

1962
01:48:25,950 --> 01:48:29,340
drop bombs all over very large areas.
How can that go wrong?

1963
01:48:30,390 --> 01:48:35,390
And that's terrifying.
And there's practical engineering 

1964
01:48:35,390 --> 01:48:38,271
solutions to that oversight and there's,
that's something that engineers to sit 

1965
01:48:38,271 --> 01:48:40,760
down and there's an engineering ethic 
where you encoding,

1966
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:43,000
you have meetings,
uh,

1967
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:45,270
of how do we make this safe?
That's what you worry about.

1968
01:48:45,530 --> 01:48:48,420
A thing that keeps me up at night is the
40,000

1969
01:48:48,421 --> 01:48:51,620
people that die every year in auto 
crashes like that.

1970
01:48:51,690 --> 01:48:56,690
I worry about not.
You have to understand like I worry 

1971
01:48:56,690 --> 01:49:00,630
about the future of Agi taking over,
but that's not as large.

1972
01:49:00,631 --> 01:49:04,170
Agi Now Agi,
artificial general intelligence.

1973
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:07,200
That's kind of the term is that people 
have been using for this,

1974
01:49:07,410 --> 01:49:12,410
but I'm maybe because I'm in it,
I worry more about the 40,000

1975
01:49:13,021 --> 01:49:18,021
people that die in the United States in 
the one point 2 million that die every 

1976
01:49:18,021 --> 01:49:18,021
year from auto crashes.

1977
01:49:18,021 --> 01:49:22,970
There's something that is more real to 
me about the death that's happening now 

1978
01:49:24,361 --> 01:49:26,610
that could be helped and that's the 
fight,

1979
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:30,450
but a force.
If the threat becomes real,

1980
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:33,470
then then that's a much,
you know,

1981
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:38,600
that's a serious threat to humankind and
that's something that should be thought 

1982
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:43,131
about.
I just worry that I worry also about the

1983
01:49:43,530 --> 01:49:48,530
Ai Winter,
so I mentioned there's been two winters 

1984
01:49:48,530 --> 01:49:50,620
in the seventies,
in the eighties,

1985
01:49:50,621 --> 01:49:53,650
the nineties when funding completely 
dried up,

1986
01:49:53,770 --> 01:49:58,630
but more importantly just people stopped
getting into artificial intelligence and

1987
01:49:58,660 --> 01:50:03,660
became cynical about as possibilities 
because there was a hype cycle where 

1988
01:50:03,660 --> 01:50:07,231
everyone is really excited about the 
possibilities of ai and then they 

1989
01:50:07,231 --> 01:50:07,231
realized,
you know,

1990
01:50:07,231 --> 01:50:11,790
five,
10 years into the development that we 

1991
01:50:11,790 --> 01:50:11,790
didn't actually achieve anything.

1992
01:50:11,790 --> 01:50:12,650
It was just too far off,
too far off.

1993
01:50:12,710 --> 01:50:16,130
Same as it was for virtual reality.
For the longest time.

1994
01:50:16,131 --> 01:50:21,131
Virtual reality was something that was 
discussed like even in the eighties and 

1995
01:50:21,131 --> 01:50:21,131
the nineties,
but it,

1996
01:50:21,131 --> 01:50:21,950
it just died off.
Nobody even thought about it.

1997
01:50:22,190 --> 01:50:26,480
Now it's come back to the forefront when
there's real ai,

1998
01:50:26,540 --> 01:50:31,540
a real excuse me,
real virtual reality that you can use 

1999
01:50:31,540 --> 01:50:32,240
like htc vives or you know,
things along those lines.

2000
01:50:32,241 --> 01:50:37,241
We can put these helmets on and you 
really do see these alternative worlds 

2001
01:50:37,241 --> 01:50:42,221
that people have created in these video 
games and it's you realize like there's 

2002
01:50:42,221 --> 01:50:46,361
a practical application for this stuff 
because the technology has caught up 

2003
01:50:46,361 --> 01:50:46,361
with the concept.

2004
01:50:46,361 --> 01:50:50,960
Yeah,
and I actually don't know where people 

2005
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:54,561
stand on Vr.
We do quite a bit of stuff with Vr for 

2006
01:50:54,561 --> 01:50:54,561
research purposes,
for simulating robotic systems,

2007
01:50:54,561 --> 01:50:59,361
but I don't know where the hype is.
I don't know if people calm down a 

2008
01:50:59,361 --> 01:51:02,721
little bit on Vr.
So there was a hype in the eighties and 

2009
01:51:02,721 --> 01:51:02,721
nineties.
I think it's ramped up quite a bit.

2010
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:05,820
What does the other one that had the 
oculus rift and what other,

2011
01:51:05,830 --> 01:51:08,130
what other than just those two?
Those are the main ones.

2012
01:51:08,131 --> 01:51:13,131
And there's other headsets that you can 
work and use with and there's some you 

2013
01:51:13,131 --> 01:51:14,040
can use just with a Samsung phone,
correct?

2014
01:51:14,070 --> 01:51:19,070
Yeah.
And the work of the next generation or 

2015
01:51:19,070 --> 01:51:20,961
which next year to two are going to be 
all a stand alone systems is gonna be an

2016
01:51:20,971 --> 01:51:23,640
oculus rift coming out.
You don't need a computer for at all.

2017
01:51:23,670 --> 01:51:24,780
So the ultimate

2018
01:51:25,160 --> 01:51:30,160
and fear and game fear,
the event horizon of that is the Matrix,

2019
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:31,400
right?
That's,

2020
01:51:31,430 --> 01:51:36,430
that's what people were terrified of.
Have some sort of a virtual reality 

2021
01:51:36,430 --> 01:51:37,070
world where you don't exist in the 
physical sense anymore.

2022
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:42,140
They just plug something into the brain 
stem just like they do in the matrix and

2023
01:51:42,530 --> 01:51:45,650
you're just locked into this artificial 
world.

2024
01:51:45,830 --> 01:51:50,830
Is that terrifying to you as that seems 
to be less terrifying than ai killing 

2025
01:51:50,830 --> 01:51:51,230
all of humankind?
Well,

2026
01:51:51,231 --> 01:51:51,980
it depends means

2027
01:51:52,020 --> 01:51:54,720
I mean,
what is life?

2028
01:51:54,810 --> 01:51:56,010
That's the real question,
right?

2029
01:51:56,011 --> 01:51:58,470
If you only exist inside of a computer 
program,

2030
01:51:58,471 --> 01:52:02,760
but it's a wonderful program and you,
you whatever your consciousness is.

2031
01:52:02,761 --> 01:52:04,410
And we haven't really established what 
that is,

2032
01:52:04,411 --> 01:52:05,750
right?
We don't,

2033
01:52:05,820 --> 01:52:10,820
we don't.
I mean there's a lot of really weird 

2034
01:52:10,820 --> 01:52:10,820
hippie ideas out there,
but what consciousness is your body?

2035
01:52:10,820 --> 01:52:15,591
Just like an antenna man.
And it's just like tuning into 

2036
01:52:15,591 --> 01:52:16,140
consciousness and consciousness is all 
around you.

2037
01:52:16,141 --> 01:52:18,090
It's Gaia,
the mother earth.

2038
01:52:18,091 --> 01:52:20,370
It's the universe itself.
It's God.

2039
01:52:20,371 --> 01:52:21,720
It's love.
Okay.

2040
01:52:21,780 --> 01:52:23,200
Maybe,
I don't know.

2041
01:52:23,201 --> 01:52:26,700
But if you could take that,
whatever the fuck it is and send it in a

2042
01:52:26,701 --> 01:52:30,000
cell phone in New Zealand,
is that where your consciousness is now?

2043
01:52:30,180 --> 01:52:35,180
Because like if,
if we figure out what consciousness is 

2044
01:52:35,180 --> 01:52:39,651
and get it to the point where we can 
turn it into a program or duplicate it,

2045
01:52:40,830 --> 01:52:43,650
I mean that's sounds so far away.

2046
01:52:43,890 --> 01:52:47,840
But if you weigh up to someone from 18,
20 and said,

2047
01:52:47,841 --> 01:52:52,841
hey man,
one day I'm going to take a picture of 

2048
01:52:52,841 --> 01:52:52,841
my Dick and I'm a sent to this girl.
She's going to get it on her phone.

2049
01:52:52,841 --> 01:52:57,371
They be like,
what the fuck are you talking about a 

2050
01:52:57,371 --> 01:52:57,371
photo?
What do,

2051
01:52:57,371 --> 01:52:57,500
what do you mean you're going to.
What's a photo?

2052
01:52:57,680 --> 01:52:58,520
Oh,
it's like a picture.

2053
01:52:58,521 --> 01:53:01,340
But like you don't draw it.
It's perfect.

2054
01:53:01,580 --> 01:53:05,000
It looks exactly like that.
It's in hd and I'm going to make a video

2055
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:08,400
of me taking a shit and I'm going to 
send it to every.

2056
01:53:08,460 --> 01:53:10,940
Like what the fuck is this even possible
can out of here.

2057
01:53:11,370 --> 01:53:14,150
The Dat is essentially you're capturing 
time,

2058
01:53:14,510 --> 01:53:17,210
you're capturing moments in time at a 
very,

2059
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:22,760
not a very crude sense,
but a crude sense in terms of comparing 

2060
01:53:23,811 --> 01:53:28,811
it to the actual world in the moment 
where it's happening.

2061
01:53:29,180 --> 01:53:32,480
Like here you and I are having this 
conversation.

2062
01:53:32,481 --> 01:53:34,340
We're having it in front of this wooden 
desk,

2063
01:53:34,550 --> 01:53:39,020
his paper in front of you to you and I.
We have access to all the textures,

2064
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:41,480
the sounds.
We can feel the air conditioning.

2065
01:53:41,481 --> 01:53:42,900
We can look up,
we could see the,

2066
01:53:42,901 --> 01:53:43,730
the,
the,

2067
01:53:44,050 --> 01:53:45,350
the,
the ceiling.

2068
01:53:45,750 --> 01:53:46,850
We're,
we're,

2069
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:49,490
we've got the whole thing in front of us
because we're really here,

2070
01:53:49,910 --> 01:53:53,420
but too many people that are watching 
this on youtube right now.

2071
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:58,610
They're getting a minimized crude 
version of this

2072
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:02,000
that's similar,
but it feels real.

2073
01:54:02,001 --> 01:54:04,670
It feels pretty real.
It's pretty close.

2074
01:54:04,790 --> 01:54:06,740
It's pretty close.
So I mean,

2075
01:54:06,741 --> 01:54:08,480
I've listened to your podcast for 
awhile.

2076
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:11,390
You usually have.
So when I listened to your podcast,

2077
01:54:12,350 --> 01:54:15,710
it feels like I'm sitting in with 
friends listening to a conversation,

2078
01:54:15,980 --> 01:54:18,020
so it's not as intense as,
for example,

2079
01:54:18,021 --> 01:54:23,021
Dan Carlin's hardcore history where the 
guy's like talking to me about the 

2080
01:54:23,630 --> 01:54:26,870
darkest aspects of human nature.
That show's so good.

2081
01:54:26,871 --> 01:54:29,350
I don't think you can call it a podcast.
It's not a.

2082
01:54:29,460 --> 01:54:30,770
it's,
it's an experience.

2083
01:54:31,190 --> 01:54:32,330
You're there.
I was.

2084
01:54:32,660 --> 01:54:37,660
I was hanging out with him and getting 
his con and I was in World War One.

2085
01:54:38,151 --> 01:54:41,180
World War Two,
painful attainment is an episode he had.

2086
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:46,420
We taught very dark ideas about our 
human nature and desiring the 

2087
01:54:48,620 --> 01:54:51,890
observation of the torture and suffering
of others.

2088
01:54:51,891 --> 01:54:53,420
There's something really appealing to 
us.

2089
01:54:53,421 --> 01:54:58,421
He has this whole episode how throughout
history we liked watching people die and

2090
01:54:58,521 --> 01:54:59,930
there's something really dark.

2091
01:54:59,990 --> 01:55:03,500
You're saying that if somebody streamed 
or something like that,

2092
01:55:03,501 --> 01:55:06,320
now it would probably get hundreds of 
millions of views.

2093
01:55:06,350 --> 01:55:07,690
Yeah,
and we would.

2094
01:55:07,691 --> 01:55:12,691
And we're protecting ourselves from our 
own nature because we understand the 

2095
01:55:12,691 --> 01:55:16,301
destructive aspects of it.
That's why youtube would pull something 

2096
01:55:16,301 --> 01:55:16,301
like that,
right?

2097
01:55:16,301 --> 01:55:19,900
If you tied a person in between two 
trucks and pulled them apart and put 

2098
01:55:19,900 --> 01:55:21,350
that on youtube,
it would get millions of hits,

2099
01:55:21,560 --> 01:55:26,560
but youtube would pull it because we've 
decided as a society collectively that 

2100
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:28,970
those kinds of images or gruesome and 
terrible for us,

2101
01:55:29,270 --> 01:55:33,050
but nevertheless that experience of 
listening to his podcasts,

2102
01:55:33,051 --> 01:55:38,051
let's show it feels real.
Just like Vr for me is really strongly 

2103
01:55:38,051 --> 01:55:42,761
real aspects to it where I'm not sure.
I'm not sure if the

2104
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:49,010
VR technology gets much better to where 
if you had a choice between do you want 

2105
01:55:49,010 --> 01:55:53,421
to live your life in Vr,
you you're going to die just like you 

2106
01:55:53,421 --> 01:55:55,590
would in real life.
Meaning your body will die.

2107
01:55:55,740 --> 01:56:00,740
You're just going to hook up yourself to
a machine like it's a deprivation tank 

2108
01:56:00,740 --> 01:56:03,690
and just all you are is in Vr and you're
going to live in that world.

2109
01:56:03,691 --> 01:56:08,691
Which life would you choose?
Would you choose life and Vr or would 

2110
01:56:08,691 --> 01:56:09,420
you choose a real life?

2111
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:11,550
That was the guy's decision in the 
Matrix,

2112
01:56:11,551 --> 01:56:13,490
right?
The guy decided in the matrix,

2113
01:56:13,491 --> 01:56:15,390
you want it to be a special person in 
the matrix.

2114
01:56:15,391 --> 01:56:20,391
He was eating that steak talking to the 
guys and decided he was going to give 

2115
01:56:20,391 --> 01:56:20,391
up.
Remember that?

2116
01:56:20,391 --> 01:56:20,420
Yup.
Yup.

2117
01:56:20,620 --> 01:56:22,470
So what decision would you make?
I mean,

2118
01:56:22,770 --> 01:56:25,460
what is reality if it's not what you're 
experiencing,

2119
01:56:25,461 --> 01:56:30,461
right?
If you're experiencing something but 

2120
01:56:30,461 --> 01:56:32,331
it's not tactile in the sense like you 
can't drag it somewhere and put it on a 

2121
01:56:32,331 --> 01:56:33,810
scale and take a ruler to it and measure
it,

2122
01:56:34,020 --> 01:56:38,220
but in the moment of being there,
it seems like it is.

2123
01:56:38,340 --> 01:56:40,530
What is missing?
What is missing?

2124
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:41,530
Well,
it's not real.

2125
01:56:41,590 --> 01:56:43,860
What is real then?
What is real?

2126
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:45,690
Well,
that's the ultimate question in terms of

2127
01:56:45,691 --> 01:56:50,691
like are we living in a simulation?
That's one of the things that 

2128
01:56:50,691 --> 01:56:53,880
[inaudible] brought up when I was 
talking to them and this is one thing 

2129
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:58,341
that people have struggled with.
If we are one day going to come up with 

2130
01:56:58,981 --> 01:57:03,510
an artificial reality,
it's indiscernible from reality in terms

2131
01:57:03,511 --> 01:57:05,730
of emotions,
in terms of experiences,

2132
01:57:05,731 --> 01:57:06,780
feel,
touch,

2133
01:57:06,781 --> 01:57:11,781
smell,
all of the sensory input that you get 

2134
01:57:11,781 --> 01:57:12,690
from the regular world.
If that's inevitable,

2135
01:57:12,691 --> 01:57:17,691
if one day we do come up with that,
how are we to discern whether or not we 

2136
01:57:17,691 --> 01:57:19,980
have already created that and we're 
stuck in it right now

2137
01:57:20,820 --> 01:57:24,180
that we can't and there's a lot of 
philosophical arguments for that,

2138
01:57:24,181 --> 01:57:25,530
but that gets it the.
Yeah.

2139
01:57:25,531 --> 01:57:27,590
The nature of reality is.
I mean,

2140
01:57:27,730 --> 01:57:32,730
it's fascinating because we're okay.
We're totally clueless about what it 

2141
01:57:32,730 --> 01:57:36,090
means to be real.
It needs to exist to exist.

2142
01:57:36,091 --> 01:57:38,490
So consciousness for us.
I mean,

2143
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:43,520
it's incredible.
You look at your own hand like I'm 

2144
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:45,210
pretty sure I'm on the Joe Rogan 
experience podcast.

2145
01:57:45,270 --> 01:57:48,390
I'm pretty sure this is not real.
I'm imagining all of it.

2146
01:57:48,391 --> 01:57:53,391
There's a knife in front of me.
I mean it's surreal and I have no proof 

2147
01:57:53,391 --> 01:57:57,561
that it's not fake and,
and those kinds of things actually come 

2148
01:57:57,561 --> 01:58:01,371
into play with the way we think about 
artificial intelligence to like what is 

2149
01:58:01,371 --> 01:58:04,110
intelligence?
It seems like it seems like we're easily

2150
01:58:04,111 --> 01:58:09,111
impressed by by algorithms and robots.
We create that appear to have 

2151
01:58:09,391 --> 01:58:14,391
intelligence,
but we still don't know what is 

2152
01:58:14,391 --> 01:58:15,810
intelligent and how close those things 
are to us

2153
01:58:15,970 --> 01:58:20,970
and we think that ourselves as this 
biological entity that can think and 

2154
01:58:20,970 --> 01:58:25,951
talk and cry and laugh,
that we're somehow or another more 

2155
01:58:25,951 --> 01:58:30,211
important than sort of some sort of 
silicone based thing that we create that

2156
01:58:30,731 --> 01:58:32,620
does everything that we do.
But far better.

2157
01:58:33,090 --> 01:58:33,870
Yeah.
I think,

2158
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:39,080
uh,
I think if I were to take a stand still 

2159
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:39,080
right,
stand,

2160
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:41,770
I hope I'm young one day run for 
president in this platform by the way

2161
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:45,400
that defending the rights.
I can't because I'm rushing,

2162
01:58:45,401 --> 01:58:47,660
but maybe a little cheesy rules,
uh,

2163
01:58:48,130 --> 01:58:52,310
that the robots will have rights and I,
I'll,

2164
01:58:52,450 --> 01:58:52,890
I'll,
I'll,

2165
01:58:52,980 --> 01:58:56,240
you know,
robots lives matter and I,

2166
01:58:56,310 --> 01:59:01,310
I actually believe that we're going to 
have to start struggling with the idea 

2167
01:59:01,510 --> 01:59:06,510
of how we interact with robots.
I've seen too often the abuse of robots 

2168
01:59:06,510 --> 01:59:08,290
and not just the Boston dynamics,
but literally people.

2169
01:59:09,310 --> 01:59:12,500
You leave them alone with the robot.
That dark nature of Hue,

2170
01:59:12,940 --> 01:59:17,940
dark aspects of human nature comes out 
and it's worrying to me I would like a 

2171
01:59:17,940 --> 01:59:22,831
robot that spars but only can move it 
like 50 percent of what I can move out 

2172
01:59:22,831 --> 01:59:24,330
so I could fuck it up.
Yeah.

2173
01:59:24,810 --> 01:59:27,910
She shouldn't be able to practice like 
really well.

2174
01:59:28,150 --> 01:59:31,690
Like you would develop like some awesome
like sparring instincts.

2175
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:32,740
Yeah,
I a robot,

2176
01:59:32,741 --> 01:59:34,360
but there would still be consequences.

2177
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:37,210
Like if you did fuck up and you got lazy
and it led,

2178
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:38,440
kicked you,
you didn't check it.

2179
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:43,500
It would hurt.
I would love to see a last stream of 

2180
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:46,230
that session because the,
you know,

2181
01:59:46,240 --> 01:59:48,940
there's so many ways I used to.
I mean I had practiced on a dummy.

2182
01:59:48,970 --> 01:59:53,970
There is aspects to a dummy that's 
helpful in terms of positioning and 

2183
01:59:54,240 --> 01:59:58,360
where were your stances and technique to
it.

2184
01:59:58,570 --> 02:00:03,570
I could certainly see that going wrong 
in ways where a robot might not respect 

2185
02:00:03,881 --> 02:00:06,730
you.
Tapping or world supposed to beat you to

2186
02:00:06,731 --> 02:00:11,731
death as tired as you fucking it up 
every day and one day you get tired or 

2187
02:00:11,731 --> 02:00:16,261
what have you,
sprain your ankle and it gets on top of 

2188
02:00:16,261 --> 02:00:18,151
you and mounts you and just starts 
blasting the face and to say he'll hook 

2189
02:00:18,151 --> 02:00:19,180
or something.
You'd have to be able to say,

2190
02:00:19,181 --> 02:00:19,720
stop.

2191
02:00:20,530 --> 02:00:25,530
Well then no,
you're gonna have to use your martial 

2192
02:00:25,530 --> 02:00:25,530
art to defend yourself,
right?

2193
02:00:25,530 --> 02:00:28,300
Because if you make it too easy for the 
robot to just stop at any time,

2194
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:32,110
then you're not really going to learn.
Like one of the consequences of training

2195
02:00:32,170 --> 02:00:36,010
if you're out of shape is if you get 
tired people fuck you up.

2196
02:00:36,220 --> 02:00:38,350
And that's incentive for you to not get 
tired.

2197
02:00:38,351 --> 02:00:41,830
Like there was so many times that I 
would be in the gym,

2198
02:00:41,831 --> 02:00:46,831
like doing strength and conditioning.
And I think about moments where I got 

2199
02:00:46,831 --> 02:00:47,290
tapped.
What guys caught me and something that I

2200
02:00:47,291 --> 02:00:49,300
was exhausted.
I couldn't get out of the triangle.

2201
02:00:49,301 --> 02:00:49,960
I'm like,
Shit.

2202
02:00:50,140 --> 02:00:55,140
And I just fucking die.
I just really push on the treadmill or 

2203
02:00:55,140 --> 02:00:55,140
you know,
push on the um,

2204
02:00:55,210 --> 02:00:55,960
you know,
um,

2205
02:00:56,560 --> 02:00:58,870
airdyne bike or whatever it was that I 
was doing,

2206
02:00:58,900 --> 02:01:00,490
thinking about those moments.

2207
02:01:00,490 --> 02:01:01,750
Getting tired.
Yeah,

2208
02:01:01,751 --> 02:01:03,670
those moments.
That's what I think about when I do like

2209
02:01:03,671 --> 02:01:08,190
sprints and stuff was um,
the feeling of competition,

2210
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:12,310
those nerves of stepping in there and 
just,

2211
02:01:12,510 --> 02:01:14,710
it's really hard to do that kind of 
visualization.

2212
02:01:14,711 --> 02:01:17,700
But it was effective though.
And the,

2213
02:01:17,740 --> 02:01:22,740
the,
the feeling of consequences to you not 

2214
02:01:22,740 --> 02:01:26,041
having any energy.
So you have to muster up the energy 

2215
02:01:26,041 --> 02:01:29,970
because if you don't,
you're going to get fucked up or 

2216
02:01:29,970 --> 02:01:29,970
something bad's going to happen to 
someone you care about or something.

2217
02:01:30,010 --> 02:01:33,010
Something's gonna Happen to the world.
Maybe you're a superhero.

2218
02:01:33,030 --> 02:01:37,540
You saving the world from the robots.
That's right.

2219
02:01:38,370 --> 02:01:39,460
But I did go back

2220
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:40,800
what we're talking about,
sorry to interrupt you,

2221
02:01:40,801 --> 02:01:43,100
but just to bring this all back around,
what,

2222
02:01:43,101 --> 02:01:48,101
what is,
what is this life and what is 

2223
02:01:48,101 --> 02:01:48,270
consciousness and what does this 
experience,

2224
02:01:48,480 --> 02:01:52,470
and if you can replicate this experience
in a way that's indiscernible,

2225
02:01:52,680 --> 02:01:54,990
will you choose to do that?
Like if someone says to you,

2226
02:01:54,991 --> 02:01:59,640
Hey Lex,
you don't have much time left,

2227
02:01:59,670 --> 02:02:01,470
but what?
We have an option,

2228
02:02:01,890 --> 02:02:05,190
we have an option and we can take your 
consciousness.

2229
02:02:05,191 --> 02:02:08,370
As you know it right now,
put it into this program.

2230
02:02:08,550 --> 02:02:10,770
You will have no idea that this has 
happened.

2231
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:12,390
You're going to close your eyes.
You're going to wake up,

2232
02:02:12,391 --> 02:02:14,460
you're going to be in the most beautiful
green field.

2233
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:17,250
It's going to be naked women everywhere.
Feasts,

2234
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:22,280
everywhere you go,
it's going to be just picnic tables 

2235
02:02:22,280 --> 02:02:25,461
filled with the most glorious food.
You're going to drive around a Ferrari 

2236
02:02:25,461 --> 02:02:27,570
every day and fly around in a plane.
You never going to die.

2237
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:30,110
You can have a great time or take a 
chance.

2238
02:02:30,120 --> 02:02:31,080
Chances.
See what happens?

2239
02:02:31,410 --> 02:02:34,740
Shut off.
Well,

2240
02:02:34,770 --> 02:02:36,030
first of all,
I'm a simple man.

2241
02:02:36,120 --> 02:02:38,490
I don't need multiple women.
One is good.

2242
02:02:38,550 --> 02:02:40,440
I'm romantic,
you say,

2243
02:02:40,650 --> 02:02:43,050
but that's in this world,
this world.

2244
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:48,200
You've got an incentive to not be greedy
in this other world where you can 

2245
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:48,870
breathe underwater and fly through the 
air and you know,

2246
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:54,160
not I.
I believe that scarcity is the 

2247
02:02:54,160 --> 02:02:58,880
fundamental ingredient of happiness.
So if you give me 72 virgins,

2248
02:03:00,300 --> 02:03:03,500
whatever it is,
and we just keep one slut,

2249
02:03:05,730 --> 02:03:08,100
slut,
she a requirement.

2250
02:03:08,101 --> 02:03:11,310
You know,
somebody intelligent and interesting who

2251
02:03:11,311 --> 02:03:16,311
enjoys sexual intercourse was not just 
enjoy sexual intercourse with a person.

2252
02:03:16,440 --> 02:03:20,790
Well that and keeps things interesting 
lex.

2253
02:03:20,791 --> 02:03:25,791
We can engineer all this into your 
experience as you don't need all these 

2254
02:03:25,791 --> 02:03:25,791
different women.
I get it.

2255
02:03:25,791 --> 02:03:28,200
I understand that.
We've got this program for you.

2256
02:03:28,201 --> 02:03:29,550
Don't worry about it.
Okay.

2257
02:03:29,551 --> 02:03:31,560
You want one,
one and a normal car,

2258
02:03:31,561 --> 02:03:33,180
like maybe a Saab or something like 
that.

2259
02:03:33,180 --> 02:03:34,270
Nothing crazy.
Yeah,

2260
02:03:34,410 --> 02:03:35,050
right.
Yeah.

2261
02:03:35,460 --> 02:03:37,200
But you're a simple man.
I get it.

2262
02:03:37,250 --> 02:03:42,250
No,
but you need to at chess with someone 

2263
02:03:42,250 --> 02:03:42,250
who could beat you every now and then,
right?

2264
02:03:42,250 --> 02:03:42,750
Yeah,
but not just chess.

2265
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:44,070
So engineers,
some flaws.

2266
02:03:44,071 --> 02:03:46,410
Like she needs to be able to lose her 
shit.

2267
02:03:46,411 --> 02:03:49,460
Every once in a while the matrix or on 
the red dress.

2268
02:03:49,830 --> 02:03:51,390
Which girl in the red dress that comes 
right here.

2269
02:03:51,410 --> 02:03:52,140
Remember?
He goes like,

2270
02:03:52,141 --> 02:03:53,640
did you notice the girl in the red 
dress?

2271
02:03:53,670 --> 02:03:55,140
It's like the one that catches his 
attention.

2272
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:58,020
I don't remember this.
This is right at the very beginning when

2273
02:03:58,021 --> 02:04:01,080
he's telling them what the Matrix is.
She walks by right here.

2274
02:04:01,230 --> 02:04:02,070
Oh,
there she is,

2275
02:04:02,130 --> 02:04:04,620
but Bam.
That's your girl.

2276
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:06,270
The guy afterwards.
It's like I ended up telling you.

2277
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:10,200
It's just not.
It's not.

2278
02:04:10,260 --> 02:04:10,680
Well.
Yeah,

2279
02:04:10,910 --> 02:04:15,910
but then I have certain features like 
I'm not an iphone guy like android so 

2280
02:04:15,910 --> 02:04:16,830
that,
that may be an iphone persons girl,

2281
02:04:16,870 --> 02:04:17,970
but that's nonsense.

2282
02:04:19,140 --> 02:04:21,120
I,
I blew up an iphone.

2283
02:04:21,121 --> 02:04:22,590
Came along.
That was better than android.

2284
02:04:22,591 --> 02:04:24,210
You wouldn't want to use it?
No,

2285
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:26,040
it might just definition of better is 
different.

2286
02:04:26,100 --> 02:04:27,610
Like,
uh,

2287
02:04:28,050 --> 02:04:33,050
I know for me a happiness lies in 
android phones,

2288
02:04:34,860 --> 02:04:36,960
android phones,
close connection.

2289
02:04:37,050 --> 02:04:42,050
Other human beings who are flawed but 
interesting who are passionate about 

2290
02:04:42,050 --> 02:04:42,050
what they do.
Yeah.

2291
02:04:42,050 --> 02:04:42,930
But this is all engineered into your 
program.

2292
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:43,660
Yeah.
Yeah.

2293
02:04:43,770 --> 02:04:48,770
That's.
I'm requesting features here because 

2294
02:04:48,770 --> 02:04:48,770
you're requesting features,
but why?

2295
02:04:48,770 --> 02:04:49,740
Why android phones?
Is that like,

2296
02:04:49,741 --> 02:04:51,090
um,
I'm a Republican.

2297
02:04:51,150 --> 02:04:53,960
I'm a Democrat,
like android phones.

2298
02:04:54,240 --> 02:04:55,680
Is that what you're doing to get in 
tribal?

2299
02:04:55,730 --> 02:04:58,630
Not Electronics.
I totally not drivable.

2300
02:04:58,631 --> 02:05:02,370
I was just representing,
if I figured the girl in the red dress,

2301
02:05:02,430 --> 02:05:06,000
it just seems like an iphone as a 
feature set.

2302
02:05:06,090 --> 02:05:08,870
I imagined the kind of features I'm 
asking you a lot.

2303
02:05:09,540 --> 02:05:14,540
Yeah,
and it seems like she's not interested 

2304
02:05:14,540 --> 02:05:14,540
in dusty yefsky.

2305
02:05:14,540 --> 02:05:19,010
How would you know that?
So prejudice view just because she's 

2306
02:05:19,010 --> 02:05:20,700
beautiful and she's got a fitting dress.
I don't know.

2307
02:05:20,730 --> 02:05:22,470
That's fair.
That's fair.

2308
02:05:22,471 --> 02:05:24,600
You,
you sexist son of a bitch.

2309
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:27,090
I'm sorry.
Actually that was a totally.

2310
02:05:27,240 --> 02:05:32,240
She probably likes Nietzschean and sts 
can come when I say she did her phd in 

2311
02:05:32,490 --> 02:05:34,140
astrophysics.
Possibly.

2312
02:05:35,160 --> 02:05:38,040
Yeah.
That's what we're talking about.

2313
02:05:38,041 --> 02:05:39,660
All the trappings that.
Bam,

2314
02:05:39,661 --> 02:05:44,661
I'll take her all day.
I phone Andrew Commerce or if she's a 

2315
02:05:44,731 --> 02:05:48,540
windows phone about that.
I'm going to give off windows phone.

2316
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:50,040
Come on now.
I'll take her.

2317
02:05:50,070 --> 02:05:52,860
She's a windows phone.
I'll go with a flip phone from the early

2318
02:05:52,861 --> 02:05:54,810
two thousands.
I'll take a razor phone,

2319
02:05:54,830 --> 02:05:58,860
a Motorola razor phone with like 37 
minutes of battery life.

2320
02:06:02,220 --> 02:06:03,330
But we're,
we're,

2321
02:06:03,390 --> 02:06:08,390
we're talking about all the learning 
experiences and preferences that you've 

2322
02:06:08,390 --> 02:06:11,550
developed in your time here on this 
actual real earth or what we're assuming

2323
02:06:11,551 --> 02:06:14,130
is the actual real earth.
But how are we,

2324
02:06:14,610 --> 02:06:15,040
I mean,
if you're,

2325
02:06:15,120 --> 02:06:20,120
if you really are taking into account 
the possibility that one day something 

2326
02:06:21,150 --> 02:06:26,150
someone,
whether it's artificial intelligence 

2327
02:06:26,150 --> 02:06:28,350
figures it out or we figured out 
engineering a world,

2328
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:33,920
us some sort of a simulation that is 
just as real as this world.

2329
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:39,510
Like where there is no,
there's no.

2330
02:06:39,730 --> 02:06:44,730
It's impossible to discern.
Not only is it not always impossible to 

2331
02:06:44,730 --> 02:06:49,671
discern,
people choose not to discern anymore 

2332
02:06:49,671 --> 02:06:49,671
because it's so well,
why bother?

2333
02:06:49,671 --> 02:06:51,840
Why bother discerning?
That's a fascinating concept to me,

2334
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:55,680
but I think that world,
not to sound hippie or anything,

2335
02:06:55,681 --> 02:06:58,680
but I think that.
I think we live in a world that's pretty

2336
02:06:58,681 --> 02:06:59,250
damn good.

2337
02:06:59,730 --> 02:07:00,960
That is pretty good.
So.

2338
02:07:00,961 --> 02:07:05,340
But improving it with such fine,
fine ladies walking around.

2339
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:08,460
It's not necessarily that the delta 
that's positive.

2340
02:07:08,580 --> 02:07:13,580
Okay.
But that's one aspect of the 

2341
02:07:13,580 --> 02:07:13,580
improvement.
What about improving it?

2342
02:07:13,580 --> 02:07:16,650
And in this new world,
there's no drone attacks in Yemen that 

2343
02:07:16,650 --> 02:07:17,330
killed children.
I order,

2344
02:07:17,370 --> 02:07:21,210
there's no rape,
there's no sexual harassment,

2345
02:07:21,270 --> 02:07:24,090
there's no,
there's no racism,

2346
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:29,160
there's no any.
All the negative aspects of our current 

2347
02:07:29,160 --> 02:07:29,490
culture or engineered out,
I think.

2348
02:07:29,970 --> 02:07:34,970
I think a lot of religions have 
struggled with this and of course I 

2349
02:07:34,970 --> 02:07:35,070
would say I would want a world without 
that,

2350
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:36,010
but part

2351
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:41,010
of me thinks that our world is 
meaningful because of the suffering in 

2352
02:07:41,010 --> 02:07:41,010
the world.

2353
02:07:41,010 --> 02:07:42,240
Right.
That's a real problem,

2354
02:07:42,241 --> 02:07:43,620
isn't it?
It's a real.

2355
02:07:43,621 --> 02:07:45,960
It's.
That is a fascinating concept.

2356
02:07:45,961 --> 02:07:50,961
It's almost impossible to ignore.
Do you appreciate love because of all 

2357
02:07:50,961 --> 02:07:52,510
the hate,
you know,

2358
02:07:53,460 --> 02:07:58,460
like if you have a hard time finding a 
girlfriend and just no one's compatible 

2359
02:07:58,460 --> 02:08:02,580
and obviously the Hala letting the 
ladies know,

2360
02:08:03,090 --> 02:08:08,090
but if you,
if you do have a hard time connecting 

2361
02:08:08,090 --> 02:08:09,480
with someone and then you finally do 
connect with someone off after all those

2362
02:08:09,481 --> 02:08:12,810
years of loneliness and this person's 
perfectly compatible with you,

2363
02:08:12,811 --> 02:08:14,460
how much more will you appreciate them?
Then?

2364
02:08:14,461 --> 02:08:19,461
A guy like Dan Bilzerian was flying 
around in a private jet bang and tens 

2365
02:08:19,461 --> 02:08:23,661
all day long,
or maybe he's fucking drowning in his 

2366
02:08:23,661 --> 02:08:26,070
own sorrow.
Maybe he's got too much,

2367
02:08:26,610 --> 02:08:29,060
too much prosperity and this,
you know,

2368
02:08:29,370 --> 02:08:34,370
yeah,
we had that with social networks to the 

2369
02:08:34,370 --> 02:08:34,370
people that,
I mean,

2370
02:08:34,370 --> 02:08:38,070
you're pretty famous in the amount of 
love you get is huge.

2371
02:08:38,430 --> 02:08:43,430
It's a,
it might be because of the overflow of 

2372
02:08:43,430 --> 02:08:45,540
love.
It might be difficult to appreciate more

2373
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:47,280
like genuine little moments of love.

2374
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:49,930
And it's not for me.
No.

2375
02:08:50,020 --> 02:08:50,770
Um,
I,

2376
02:08:51,130 --> 02:08:56,130
I spent a lot of time thinking about 
that and I also spent a lot of time 

2377
02:08:56,130 --> 02:09:00,211
thinking about how titanic really 
bizarre my place in the world is.

2378
02:09:01,630 --> 02:09:02,030
I mean,
I,

2379
02:09:02,031 --> 02:09:06,550
I think about it a lot and I spent a lot
of time being poor and being a loser.

2380
02:09:06,750 --> 02:09:08,950
Me,
my childhood was not the best.

2381
02:09:09,240 --> 02:09:14,240
I went through a lot of struggle when I 
was young that I cling to like a safety 

2382
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:15,550
rep raft.
You know,

2383
02:09:15,560 --> 02:09:16,330
I,
I don't,

2384
02:09:16,660 --> 02:09:21,660
I don't ever think there's something 
special about me and I try to let 

2385
02:09:21,660 --> 02:09:22,780
everybody know that you,
anybody can do it.

2386
02:09:22,781 --> 02:09:26,010
I've done it.
You just have to just keep going though.

2387
02:09:26,090 --> 02:09:31,090
The 99 percent of this thing is just 
showing up and keep going.

2388
02:09:31,750 --> 02:09:34,590
Keep improving,
keep working at things and keep going,

2389
02:09:34,630 --> 02:09:35,400
put the time in,

2390
02:09:35,470 --> 02:09:37,870
but the interesting thing is you haven't
actually,

2391
02:09:37,871 --> 02:09:40,780
a couple of days ago went back to your 
first podcast and listen to it.

2392
02:09:41,470 --> 02:09:44,410
You haven't really changed much,
so you were.

2393
02:09:44,870 --> 02:09:49,660
I mean the audio got a little better and
but just like the year,

2394
02:09:49,661 --> 02:09:54,661
the genuine nature of the way you 
interact hasn't changed and that's 

2395
02:09:54,661 --> 02:09:56,140
fascinating because,
you know,

2396
02:09:56,170 --> 02:09:58,780
fame changes people.

2397
02:09:59,440 --> 02:10:00,580
Well,
I was already famous then,

2398
02:10:01,080 --> 02:10:03,580
but just in a different way.
I was famous.

2399
02:10:03,640 --> 02:10:08,410
I was already famous from fear factor.
I was already already had standup comedy

2400
02:10:08,411 --> 02:10:12,910
specials already had.
I'd already been on a sitcom.

2401
02:10:14,340 --> 02:10:17,530
Wasn't as famous as I am now,
but I understood what it is.

2402
02:10:17,980 --> 02:10:22,450
I'm a big believer in adversity and 
struggle.

2403
02:10:22,451 --> 02:10:27,451
I think they're very important for you.
It's one of the reasons why appreciate 

2404
02:10:27,451 --> 02:10:30,211
martial arts.
It's one of the reasons why I've been 

2405
02:10:30,211 --> 02:10:32,731
drawn to it as a learning tool,
not just as something where it's a 

2406
02:10:32,731 --> 02:10:37,621
puzzle that I'm fascinated to try to 
figure out how to get better at the 

2407
02:10:37,621 --> 02:10:40,781
puzzle.
And martial arts is a really good 

2408
02:10:40,781 --> 02:10:40,781
example because you never really the 
best,

2409
02:10:40,781 --> 02:10:42,830
especially when there's just so many 
people doing it.

2410
02:10:42,890 --> 02:10:44,690
It's like you're always going to get 
beat by guys.

2411
02:10:44,691 --> 02:10:49,691
And then I was never,
I was never putting the time into it as 

2412
02:10:49,691 --> 02:10:49,691
a,
an adult outside of,

2413
02:10:49,691 --> 02:10:51,170
uh,
my taekwondo competition.

2414
02:10:51,170 --> 02:10:54,950
I was never really putting all day every
day into it.

2415
02:10:54,980 --> 02:10:56,860
Like a lot of people that I would train 
would.

2416
02:10:56,920 --> 02:10:59,360
And so I'd always get dominated by the 
really best guys.

2417
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:02,750
So there's a certain amount of humility 
that comes from that as well.

2418
02:11:03,050 --> 02:11:08,050
But there's,
there's a struggle in that you're 

2419
02:11:08,050 --> 02:11:11,711
learning about yourself and your own 
limits and the limits of the human mind 

2420
02:11:14,990 --> 02:11:19,990
and endurance and just not understanding
all the various interactions of 

2421
02:11:20,181 --> 02:11:21,740
techniques and that,
you know,

2422
02:11:22,010 --> 02:11:27,010
there's some,
there's humility to that in that I've 

2423
02:11:27,010 --> 02:11:29,411
always described martial arts as a 
vehicle for developing your own human 

2424
02:11:29,411 --> 02:11:33,071
potential.
But I think marathon running a similar 

2425
02:11:33,071 --> 02:11:33,080
aspects.
I think when you're just,

2426
02:11:33,110 --> 02:11:38,110
you figure out a way to keep pushing and
push through the control of your mind 

2427
02:11:38,961 --> 02:11:41,360
and your desire and overcoming 
adversity.

2428
02:11:41,361 --> 02:11:43,910
I think overcoming adversity is critical
for the human,

2429
02:11:45,110 --> 02:11:46,040
for humans.

2430
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:49,250
We have this,
this,

2431
02:11:49,251 --> 02:11:54,251
um,
these set of reward systems that are 

2432
02:11:54,251 --> 02:11:57,170
designed to do,
to reward us for overcoming,

2433
02:11:57,530 --> 02:12:01,760
for overcoming obstacles,
for overcoming a relationship,

2434
02:12:01,761 --> 02:12:05,240
struggles for overcoming physical 
limitations.

2435
02:12:05,510 --> 02:12:10,510
And those rewards are great and there 
are some of the most amazing moments in 

2436
02:12:10,510 --> 02:12:15,341
life when you do overcome.
And I think this is sort of engineered 

2437
02:12:15,341 --> 02:12:16,100
into the system.
So for me,

2438
02:12:16,101 --> 02:12:20,300
fame is almost like a cheat code.
It's like you don't really want it.

2439
02:12:20,301 --> 02:12:22,100
Don't dwell on that man.
Like that is,

2440
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:24,650
that's like a free buffet.
Like you don't,

2441
02:12:24,910 --> 02:12:26,960
you know,
you want to go hunt your own food,

2442
02:12:26,990 --> 02:12:31,990
you want to make your own fire,
you want to cook yourself and feel the 

2443
02:12:31,990 --> 02:12:32,600
satisfaction.
You don't want people feeding you grapes

2444
02:12:32,601 --> 02:12:33,590
while you lie down.

2445
02:12:34,210 --> 02:12:38,170
What is the hardest thing?
So you talked about challenge a lot.

2446
02:12:38,260 --> 02:12:42,520
What's the hardest thing you've won?
Have you been really humbled

2447
02:12:43,150 --> 02:12:44,440
martial arts?
For sure.

2448
02:12:44,441 --> 02:12:46,360
The most humbling.
Yeah,

2449
02:12:46,361 --> 02:12:50,860
from the moment I started,
I mean I got really good at taekwondo,

2450
02:12:50,920 --> 02:12:55,920
but even then I'd still get the fuck 
beaten out of me by my friends and got 

2451
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:59,640
training part.
Especially when you're tired and you're 

2452
02:12:59,640 --> 02:12:59,960
doing your rotating partners and guys 
are bigger than you.

2453
02:12:59,961 --> 02:13:02,080
It's just,
it's just humbling,

2454
02:13:02,480 --> 02:13:03,190
you know,
martial arts,

2455
02:13:03,191 --> 02:13:03,880
very humbling.

2456
02:13:04,730 --> 02:13:07,080
No,
I got to call you out on something.

2457
02:13:08,420 --> 02:13:12,090
So you talk about education system 
sometimes I've heard you say is a little

2458
02:13:12,091 --> 02:13:17,091
broken in high school and so on.
I'm not really calling out and just I 

2459
02:13:18,301 --> 02:13:21,420
just want to talk about it because I 
think it's important and as somebody who

2460
02:13:21,421 --> 02:13:24,870
loves math,
it talked about your own journey.

2461
02:13:24,871 --> 02:13:29,871
Was school didn't give you a passion?
Well you can maybe talk to that,

2462
02:13:35,011 --> 02:13:39,930
but for me what I always do,
maybe I'm sick in the head or something,

2463
02:13:39,990 --> 02:13:43,760
but for me math was exciting.
The way martial arts,

2464
02:13:43,810 --> 02:13:46,710
we're excited for you because it was 
really hard.

2465
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:50,610
I wanted to quit and the idea of,
of education,

2466
02:13:50,611 --> 02:13:51,890
I have that,
that,

2467
02:13:52,620 --> 02:13:57,620
that seems to be flawed nowadays a 
little bit is that we want to make 

2468
02:13:57,620 --> 02:14:01,050
education easier,
that we want to make more accessible and

2469
02:14:01,051 --> 02:14:01,470
so on.

2470
02:14:01,560 --> 02:14:02,880
Uh,
accessible of course is great,

2471
02:14:03,240 --> 02:14:06,870
but you kind of forget in that.
And those are all good goals.

2472
02:14:07,200 --> 02:14:11,790
You forget in that it's supposed to be 
also hard and like teachers,

2473
02:14:12,450 --> 02:14:15,510
just the way you're wrestling coach,
if you like quit,

2474
02:14:15,511 --> 02:14:16,730
you say,
I can't do anymore.

2475
02:14:16,740 --> 02:14:18,660
I have to come up with some kind of 
excuse.

2476
02:14:18,930 --> 02:14:23,930
You're wrestling coach looks at you 
wants to say get your ass back on the 

2477
02:14:23,930 --> 02:14:25,890
mat the same way I wish math teachers 
did that.

2478
02:14:26,100 --> 02:14:30,840
When people say it's almost like cool 
now to say i's not math sucks,

2479
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:35,280
mass not for me or science sucks as his 
teacher's boring.

2480
02:14:35,910 --> 02:14:40,910
I think there are,
there's room for some culture where 

2481
02:14:40,910 --> 02:14:40,910
says,
no,

2482
02:14:40,910 --> 02:14:40,910
no,
no,

2483
02:14:40,910 --> 02:14:44,510
you're not.
If you just put in the time and you 

2484
02:14:44,510 --> 02:14:45,210
struggle,
then that opens up the universe to you.

2485
02:14:45,270 --> 02:14:49,530
Like whether you become a neil degrasse 
tyson or the next fields medal winner in

2486
02:14:49,531 --> 02:14:50,250
mathematics.

2487
02:14:50,600 --> 02:14:52,610
I would not argue with you for one 
second.

2488
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:57,880
I would also say that one of the more 
beautiful things about human beings is 

2489
02:14:57,880 --> 02:15:02,471
that we vary so much and that one person
who is just obsessed with playing the 

2490
02:15:02,571 --> 02:15:05,630
trombone and to me,
I don't give a fuck about trombones,

2491
02:15:06,110 --> 02:15:11,110
but that's okay.
Like I can't be obsessed about 

2492
02:15:11,110 --> 02:15:12,290
everything.
Some people love golf and they just want

2493
02:15:12,291 --> 02:15:15,560
to play it all day long.
I've never played golf a day in my life.

2494
02:15:15,920 --> 02:15:19,280
Set Miniature Golf and just fucking 
around,

2495
02:15:20,360 --> 02:15:25,360
but that doesn't.
It's not bad or good and I think 

2496
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:29,350
there's.
There's definitely some skills that you 

2497
02:15:29,350 --> 02:15:31,511
learned from mathematics that are hugely
significant if you want to go into type 

2498
02:15:31,511 --> 02:15:35,060
of fields that you're involved in.
For me it's never been appealing,

2499
02:15:35,420 --> 02:15:40,420
but it's not that it was just difficult.
It's also that it just,

2500
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:46,000
for whatever reason,
who I was at that time in that school 

2501
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,260
with those teachers and having the life 
experience that I had,

2502
02:15:48,650 --> 02:15:51,230
that was not what I was drawn to,
but what I was drawn to,

2503
02:15:51,231 --> 02:15:53,600
his literature I was drawn to reading.

2504
02:15:53,630 --> 02:15:58,630
I was drawn to stories,
I was drawn to possibilities and 

2505
02:15:58,630 --> 02:15:58,730
creativity.
I was drawn to all those things.

2506
02:15:58,731 --> 02:16:01,460
You are an artist of it too.
I used to be.

2507
02:16:01,880 --> 02:16:03,980
I used to want to be a comic book 
illustrator.

2508
02:16:03,981 --> 02:16:06,050
That was,
that was a big thing when I was young.

2509
02:16:06,051 --> 02:16:09,770
I was really into comic books.
I was really into um,

2510
02:16:10,940 --> 02:16:15,940
a traditional comic books and also a lot
of the horror comics from the 19 

2511
02:16:15,981 --> 02:16:19,190
seventies that black and white,
like creepy and eerie.

2512
02:16:19,400 --> 02:16:22,610
Did you ever see those things?
Creepy and eerie.

2513
02:16:22,910 --> 02:16:23,990
Like black and white?
Yeah,

2514
02:16:24,070 --> 02:16:29,070
they were.
There were a comic book series that I'm 

2515
02:16:29,070 --> 02:16:30,890
existed,
like way back in the day was all there,

2516
02:16:30,930 --> 02:16:35,930
all horror and they were like really 
cool illustrations and these wild 

2517
02:16:35,930 --> 02:16:37,420
stories,
but it was comic books,

2518
02:16:37,660 --> 02:16:39,610
but they were all black and white.
That's creepy.

2519
02:16:39,611 --> 02:16:41,620
And Eerie.
That's the actual name?

2520
02:16:41,620 --> 02:16:43,420
Yeah.
Erie and creepy.

2521
02:16:43,421 --> 02:16:45,700
Where the names like that was from.
What year was that?

2522
02:16:45,730 --> 02:16:50,730
It says September,
but it doesn't say what year am I used 

2523
02:16:50,730 --> 02:16:52,930
to get these when I was a little kid,
man,

2524
02:16:52,931 --> 02:16:54,490
I was like eight,
nine years old.

2525
02:16:54,491 --> 02:16:56,800
And the seventies,
good and evil.

2526
02:16:56,890 --> 02:16:57,880
Yeah,
it was,

2527
02:16:57,930 --> 02:16:58,420
uh,
they were,

2528
02:16:58,421 --> 02:17:03,421
they were my favorite,
like that's a cover of them and like 

2529
02:17:03,421 --> 02:17:05,590
have like covers that were done by like 
Frank Frazetta,

2530
02:17:05,620 --> 02:17:09,700
Boris Vallejo,
and just really cool shit.

2531
02:17:10,030 --> 02:17:12,100
And I was fat.
I love those.

2532
02:17:12,101 --> 02:17:17,101
When I was little I was always really 
into horror movies and really into like 

2533
02:17:17,101 --> 02:17:17,600
Bram,
like,

2534
02:17:17,620 --> 02:17:19,990
look at this werewolf one that was one 
of my favorite ones.

2535
02:17:20,440 --> 02:17:22,240
That was a crazy werewolf that was like,
well,

2536
02:17:22,250 --> 02:17:24,310
all fours,
who's the hero?

2537
02:17:24,311 --> 02:17:26,470
Usually super heroes.
Everybody dies.

2538
02:17:26,471 --> 02:17:28,170
And those,
that's the beautiful thing about it.

2539
02:17:28,171 --> 02:17:29,470
Everybody gets fucked over.

2540
02:17:29,650 --> 02:17:34,650
There was nobody.
That was the thing that I really liked 

2541
02:17:34,650 --> 02:17:34,840
about them was that nobody made it out 
alive.

2542
02:17:35,110 --> 02:17:38,650
There was no one guy who figured it out 
and rescued the woman and they wrote off

2543
02:17:38,651 --> 02:17:43,651
in the sunset,
but you turned the corner and they'd be 

2544
02:17:43,651 --> 02:17:46,351
a fucking pack of wolves with glowing 
eyes were waiting to tear everybody 

2545
02:17:46,351 --> 02:17:46,540
apart.
And that'd be the end of the book.

2546
02:17:46,890 --> 02:17:48,240
And I just,
um,

2547
02:17:48,280 --> 02:17:49,870
I was just really into the 
illustrations.

2548
02:17:49,871 --> 02:17:51,250
I found that fascinating.
I just,

2549
02:17:51,251 --> 02:17:55,450
I love those kind of horror movies and I
love those kinds of illness.

2550
02:17:55,451 --> 02:17:57,040
So that's what I wanted to do when I was
young.

2551
02:17:57,290 --> 02:18:02,290
Yeah,
I think the education system is 

2552
02:18:02,290 --> 02:18:03,850
probably.
We've talked about creativity is 

2553
02:18:03,850 --> 02:18:03,850
probably not as good at,
uh,

2554
02:18:03,850 --> 02:18:08,560
inspiring and feeding that creativity 
because I think math and wrestling can 

2555
02:18:09,231 --> 02:18:12,650
be taught systematically.
I think creativity is something.

2556
02:18:12,651 --> 02:18:14,420
Well actually I had known nothing about 
it,

2557
02:18:14,720 --> 02:18:19,720
so I think it's harder to take somebody 
like you when you're young and say and 

2558
02:18:20,511 --> 02:18:23,320
inspire you to pursue that fire.
Whatever's inside.

2559
02:18:23,321 --> 02:18:23,390
Well,

2560
02:18:23,390 --> 02:18:27,010
one of the best ways to inspire people 
is by giving them,

2561
02:18:29,020 --> 02:18:34,020
giving them these alternatives that are 
so uninteresting,

2562
02:18:36,070 --> 02:18:41,070
like saying you're going to get a job 
selling washing machines and you're 

2563
02:18:41,070 --> 02:18:41,070
like,
fuck that.

2564
02:18:41,070 --> 02:18:43,960
I'm going to figure out a way to not get
a job selling washing machines.

2565
02:18:44,380 --> 02:18:49,380
Like what some of the best motivations 
that I've ever had have been terrible 

2566
02:18:49,380 --> 02:18:49,960
jobs because you have these terrible 
jobs and go,

2567
02:18:49,961 --> 02:18:51,760
okay,
fuck that.

2568
02:18:51,790 --> 02:18:53,710
I'm going to figure out a way to not do 
this,

2569
02:18:54,030 --> 02:18:59,030
you know,
and whether you want to call it add or 

2570
02:18:59,030 --> 02:19:01,000
Adhd or whatever it is that makes kids 
squirm in class.

2571
02:19:01,630 --> 02:19:05,680
I didn't score and every class I didn't 
squirm and science class,

2572
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:08,480
I didn't squirm in,
in,

2573
02:19:08,590 --> 02:19:11,110
you know,
an interesting subjects.

2574
02:19:11,140 --> 02:19:16,140
There's things that were interesting to 
me that I would be locked in and 

2575
02:19:16,140 --> 02:19:18,090
completely fascinated by and there was 
things where I just couldn't wait to run

2576
02:19:18,091 --> 02:19:22,180
out of that room and I don't know what 
the reason is,

2577
02:19:22,181 --> 02:19:27,181
but I do know that a lot of what we call
our education system is engineered for a

2578
02:19:27,561 --> 02:19:32,561
very specific result and that result is 
you want to get a kid who can sit in 

2579
02:19:32,561 --> 02:19:37,541
class and learn so that they could sit 
in a job and perform and that for 

2580
02:19:38,631 --> 02:19:40,250
whatever reason,
that was just.

2581
02:19:40,450 --> 02:19:42,380
I mean,
I didn't have the ideal childhood.

2582
02:19:42,381 --> 02:19:47,381
Maybe.
Maybe if I did I would be more inclined 

2583
02:19:47,381 --> 02:19:49,931
to lean that way,
but I didn't want to do anything like 

2584
02:19:49,931 --> 02:19:50,120
that.
Like,

2585
02:19:50,121 --> 02:19:52,640
I couldn't wait to get the fuck out of 
school,

2586
02:19:52,670 --> 02:19:55,700
so I didn't ever have to listen to 
anybody like that again.

2587
02:19:55,760 --> 02:19:58,220
And then just a few years later,
I mean,

2588
02:19:59,030 --> 02:20:00,800
you graduated from high school and 
you're 18.

2589
02:20:00,801 --> 02:20:02,930
When I was 21,
I was a stand up comic and I was like,

2590
02:20:02,931 --> 02:20:04,220
I found it.
This is it.

2591
02:20:04,700 --> 02:20:05,450
I'm like,
good.

2592
02:20:05,451 --> 02:20:10,451
I found there's an actual job that 
nobody told me about where you could 

2593
02:20:10,451 --> 02:20:12,530
just make fun of Shit and people go out 
and they pay money to hear you.

2594
02:20:12,531 --> 02:20:15,950
Uh,
create jokes and routines and bits.

2595
02:20:16,130 --> 02:20:19,520
Really.
You weren't terrified of standup getting

2596
02:20:19,521 --> 02:20:20,450
onstage and.
Oh,

2597
02:20:20,500 --> 02:20:23,880
I was definitely nervous the first time.
Probably more nervous and he was hard on

2598
02:20:23,890 --> 02:20:24,550
him fighting.

2599
02:20:24,620 --> 02:20:26,390
No,
it's different.

2600
02:20:26,870 --> 02:20:29,720
It's different.
The consequences aren't as grave,

2601
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:32,180
but that's one of the,
they not know,

2602
02:20:32,690 --> 02:20:36,020
like embarrassment and you don't get 
pummeled.

2603
02:20:36,540 --> 02:20:37,580
I mean there's,
there's,

2604
02:20:37,690 --> 02:20:38,570
there's,
there's,

2605
02:20:38,571 --> 02:20:43,571
you could say like,
emotionally it's probably more 

2606
02:20:43,571 --> 02:20:44,050
devastating or as devastating.
But man,

2607
02:20:44,060 --> 02:20:47,150
losing a fight is,
it fucks you up for a long time.

2608
02:20:47,151 --> 02:20:50,070
You feel like shit for a long time.
Um,

2609
02:20:50,300 --> 02:20:55,300
but then you,
when you feel amazing for a long time 

2610
02:20:55,300 --> 02:20:55,300
too,
when you kill onstage,

2611
02:20:55,300 --> 02:20:56,600
you only feel good for like an hour or 
so,

2612
02:20:56,601 --> 02:20:58,430
and then it goes away.
It feels normal.

2613
02:20:58,930 --> 02:21:00,500
It's just normal.
It's just life,

2614
02:21:00,530 --> 02:21:05,530
you know.
But I think that it prepared me like 

2615
02:21:05,530 --> 02:21:08,610
competing in martial arts,
the fear of that and then the,

2616
02:21:08,690 --> 02:21:13,690
how hard it is to stand opposite another
person who's the same size as you,

2617
02:21:15,921 --> 02:21:19,700
who's equally well trained,
who's also a martial arts expert.

2618
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:21,560
And they ask you,
are you ready?

2619
02:21:21,561 --> 02:21:26,561
Are you ready?
You bow to each other and then they go 

2620
02:21:26,561 --> 02:21:26,561
fight and then you're like,
fuck,

2621
02:21:26,561 --> 02:21:30,110
here we go.
Like that to me probably was like one of

2622
02:21:30,111 --> 02:21:35,111
the best prep.
And to do that from the time I was 15 

2623
02:21:35,111 --> 02:21:36,800
until I was 21 was probably the best 
preparation for anything.

2624
02:21:36,801 --> 02:21:39,200
That was difficult too because it was so
fucking scary.

2625
02:21:39,710 --> 02:21:44,710
And then to go from that into standup,
I think it prepared me for standing up 

2626
02:21:44,710 --> 02:21:45,800
because I was already used to doing 
things that were scary.

2627
02:21:46,120 --> 02:21:48,530
Now I seek scary things out.
I Thi,

2628
02:21:48,540 --> 02:21:50,650
I seek difficult things.
Uh,

2629
02:21:50,840 --> 02:21:53,540
picking up the bow and learning that 
yes,

2630
02:21:53,541 --> 02:21:55,340
archery,
which is really difficult.

2631
02:21:56,030 --> 02:22:01,030
I mean there's some reasons why I got 
attracted even to playing pool pools.

2632
02:22:01,250 --> 02:22:06,250
Very difficult.
It's very difficult to control your 

2633
02:22:06,250 --> 02:22:08,120
nerves and high pressure situations so 
that there's,

2634
02:22:08,150 --> 02:22:10,640
there's,
there's some benefits of that,

2635
02:22:10,760 --> 02:22:12,680
but here.
But it goes back to what you were saying

2636
02:22:12,681 --> 02:22:15,200
earlier,
how much of all this stuff,

2637
02:22:15,230 --> 02:22:18,160
like when you were saying that scarcity,
there's,

2638
02:22:18,190 --> 02:22:23,190
there's,
there's real value in scarcity and that 

2639
02:22:23,190 --> 02:22:26,531
there's real value in struggle and how 
much of all this is just engineered into

2640
02:22:28,411 --> 02:22:33,411
our human system that it has given us 
the tools and the incentive to make it 

2641
02:22:34,891 --> 02:22:36,840
to 2018 with the human species.

2642
02:22:37,210 --> 02:22:39,610
Yeah.
I think it's whoever the engineer is,

2643
02:22:39,700 --> 02:22:44,500
whether it's God or nature or whatever,
I think it's engineered and somehow that

2644
02:22:44,620 --> 02:22:49,620
we get to think about that.
When you try to create an artificial 

2645
02:22:49,620 --> 02:22:51,340
intelligence system,
when you imagine what's a perfect system

2646
02:22:51,610 --> 02:22:53,560
for you,
where we talked about this with,

2647
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:56,110
with the lady,
what's the perfect system for you?

2648
02:22:56,440 --> 02:23:00,250
If you had to really put down on paper 
and engineer,

2649
02:23:00,251 --> 02:23:05,251
what's the experience of your life,
will you start to realize it actually 

2650
02:23:05,251 --> 02:23:09,001
looks a lot like your current life.
So this is the problem that companies 

2651
02:23:09,001 --> 02:23:11,980
are facing like Amazon and trying to 
create Alexa.

2652
02:23:12,910 --> 02:23:17,910
What do you want from Alexa?
Do you want a tool that says what the 

2653
02:23:17,910 --> 02:23:20,290
weather is or do you want to Alexa to 
say,

2654
02:23:21,280 --> 02:23:23,800
Joe,
I don't want to talk to you right now.

2655
02:23:25,350 --> 02:23:25,810
I Have

2656
02:23:26,300 --> 02:23:28,640
Alexa where you have to work or over 
like Alexa,

2657
02:23:28,641 --> 02:23:29,750
come on.
What do I do?

2658
02:23:29,751 --> 02:23:30,730
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

2659
02:23:30,750 --> 02:23:32,030
Listen,
if I was rude,

2660
02:23:32,040 --> 02:23:37,040
I was insensitive.
I was tired of the commute was really 

2661
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:38,330
rough and they shouldn't be like I'm 
seeing somebody else.

2662
02:23:40,490 --> 02:23:42,410
Do you remember?
Avatar depression?

2663
02:23:44,020 --> 02:23:49,020
Uh,
the movie Avatar and depression is a 

2664
02:23:49,020 --> 02:23:49,020
psychological effect after the movies.

2665
02:23:49,020 --> 02:23:53,790
Yeah.
It was a real term that people were 

2666
02:23:53,790 --> 02:23:56,131
using,
that psychologists were using because 

2667
02:23:56,131 --> 02:23:56,131
people would see the movie Avatar,
which I loved.

2668
02:23:56,290 --> 02:23:57,100
A lot of people said,
oh,

2669
02:23:57,101 --> 02:24:00,250
it's fucking pocahontas was blue people 
to those people.

2670
02:24:00,251 --> 02:24:01,630
I say,
fuck off.

2671
02:24:02,110 --> 02:24:04,000
You want to talk about suspension of 
disbelief.

2672
02:24:04,001 --> 02:24:09,001
That to me,
that movie was the ultimate suspension 

2673
02:24:09,001 --> 02:24:09,001
of disbelief.
I love that movie.

2674
02:24:09,001 --> 02:24:09,460
I fucking love that.
I can't.

2675
02:24:09,700 --> 02:24:12,550
I know James Cameron is working on like 
15 sequels right now.

2676
02:24:12,551 --> 02:24:15,460
All simultaneously.
I wish that motherfucker would dole them

2677
02:24:15,461 --> 02:24:16,500
out.
He's like a,

2678
02:24:16,501 --> 02:24:20,260
a crack dealer that gets you hooked once
and then you just waiting outside in the

2679
02:24:20,261 --> 02:24:20,870
cold.
Shiver.

2680
02:24:20,871 --> 02:24:22,650
And for years,
um,

2681
02:24:23,530 --> 02:24:28,530
avatar depression was a psychological 
term that psychologists were using to 

2682
02:24:29,651 --> 02:24:34,651
describe this mass influx of people that
saw that movie and were so enthralled by

2683
02:24:35,771 --> 02:24:40,771
the way the Navi lived in Pandora that 
they came back to this stupid to leave.

2684
02:24:43,670 --> 02:24:46,060
They wanted to be like the blue guy in 
Avatar.

2685
02:24:46,210 --> 02:24:48,380
And it also,
there was a,

2686
02:24:48,740 --> 02:24:53,740
there was a mechanism in that film where
this regular person became a Navi.

2687
02:24:54,280 --> 02:24:58,990
He became through the Avatar and then 
eventually that tree of life or whatever

2688
02:24:58,991 --> 02:25:02,710
it was,
they transferred his essence into this,

2689
02:25:03,130 --> 02:25:06,220
create this avatar.
And he became one of them.

2690
02:25:06,610 --> 02:25:11,610
He became one of them.
He absorbed their culture and it was 

2691
02:25:11,610 --> 02:25:14,731
very much like our romanticized versions
of the native Americans that they lived 

2692
02:25:16,241 --> 02:25:19,660
in symbiotic relationship with the 
earth.

2693
02:25:19,990 --> 02:25:24,990
They only took what they needed.
They had spiritual connection to their 

2694
02:25:24,990 --> 02:25:29,671
food and to nature and to the just the,
their existence was was noble and it was

2695
02:25:32,111 --> 02:25:37,111
honorable and it wasn't selfish and it 
was powerful and it was spiritual and 

2696
02:25:37,111 --> 02:25:38,320
that we're missing these things.

2697
02:25:38,410 --> 02:25:43,410
We're missing these things and I think 
we are better at romanticizing them and 

2698
02:25:43,410 --> 02:25:45,310
craving them as opposed to living them 
as.

2699
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:50,760
I mean,
you look at movies like happy people 

2700
02:25:50,760 --> 02:25:50,930
with the life and the tiger den.
Live life in a tie.

2701
02:25:50,960 --> 02:25:52,020
GMS,
yeah,

2702
02:25:52,150 --> 02:25:56,560
I'm rushing center.
Herzog's film is part of you wants to be

2703
02:25:56,561 --> 02:25:57,010
like,
well,

2704
02:25:57,011 --> 02:26:02,011
I want to be out there in nature,
focusing on simple survival,

2705
02:26:02,350 --> 02:26:05,530
setting traps for animals,
cooking some soup,

2706
02:26:05,970 --> 02:26:10,540
a family around you,
and just kind of focusing on the basics.

2707
02:26:10,990 --> 02:26:13,360
But.
And I'm the same way,

2708
02:26:13,390 --> 02:26:16,300
like I go out hiking and I go out in 
nature.

2709
02:26:16,301 --> 02:26:18,940
I would love to pick up hunting and I 
want.

2710
02:26:18,941 --> 02:26:21,670
I'm crave that,
but if you just put me in the forest,

2711
02:26:21,910 --> 02:26:26,910
I'll probably.
It'd be like I'm taking your phone away 

2712
02:26:26,910 --> 02:26:26,910
and you're staying here.
That's it.

2713
02:26:26,910 --> 02:26:31,621
You never go into return to your 
facebook and your twitter and your and 

2714
02:26:31,621 --> 02:26:31,900
your robots.

2715
02:26:32,530 --> 02:26:36,670
I don't know if I'll be so romantic 
about that notion anymore.

2716
02:26:37,450 --> 02:26:41,500
I don't know either,
but I think that's also the genie in the

2717
02:26:41,501 --> 02:26:43,570
bottle,
right discussion.

2718
02:26:44,030 --> 02:26:46,600
I think that genie's out of the bottle 
for so long.

2719
02:26:46,640 --> 02:26:47,680
You'd be like,
but what am I?

2720
02:26:47,681 --> 02:26:48,520
Facebook?
What have I got?

2721
02:26:48,521 --> 02:26:51,250
Some messages.
Let me check my email real quick.

2722
02:26:51,280 --> 02:26:51,640
No,
no,

2723
02:26:51,641 --> 02:26:52,630
no.
We're in the forest.

2724
02:26:52,900 --> 02:26:55,750
There's no wifi out here.
No wifi ever.

2725
02:26:56,050 --> 02:27:00,070
What the fuck?
How do people get your porn porn?

2726
02:27:00,370 --> 02:27:03,250
No,
that's another understudied.

2727
02:27:03,970 --> 02:27:05,020
Again,
not an expert,

2728
02:27:05,500 --> 02:27:09,160
but the impact of Internet pornography 
on culture.

2729
02:27:09,310 --> 02:27:10,020
Oh yeah.
I'm,

2730
02:27:10,030 --> 02:27:15,030
it's significant.
And also ignored to a certain extent and

2731
02:27:15,131 --> 02:27:16,990
um,
if not ignored,

2732
02:27:17,080 --> 02:27:22,080
uh,
definitely purposefully left out of the 

2733
02:27:22,901 --> 02:27:23,890
conversation.
Yeah.

2734
02:27:23,891 --> 02:27:28,780
There's a another phd student,
a person from Google came to give a tech

2735
02:27:28,781 --> 02:27:33,781
talk and he opened by saying 90 percent 
of you in the audience have this month,

2736
02:27:34,030 --> 02:27:36,220
Google the pornographic term in our 
search engine,

2737
02:27:37,270 --> 02:27:42,270
and it was really a great opener because
people were just all really 

2738
02:27:42,270 --> 02:27:46,861
uncomfortable because we just kind of 
hide it away into this,

2739
02:27:48,010 --> 02:27:53,010
but it certainly has an impact.
I think there's a suppression aspect to 

2740
02:27:53,010 --> 02:27:53,010
that too.
That's unhealthy.

2741
02:27:53,010 --> 02:27:53,010
We,
we,

2742
02:27:53,250 --> 02:27:58,250
we,
we have a suppression of our sexuality 

2743
02:27:58,250 --> 02:27:58,250
because we think that somehow or another
it's negative,

2744
02:27:58,440 --> 02:27:59,200
right.
You know,

2745
02:27:59,201 --> 02:28:03,310
and especially for women,
I mean for women like men

2746
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:08,390
and who is a sexual conqueror is thought
to be a stud.

2747
02:28:08,690 --> 02:28:13,690
Whereas a woman who seeks out a multiple
desirable sexual partners is thought to 

2748
02:28:15,741 --> 02:28:18,710
be troubled or something wrong with her.
You know,

2749
02:28:18,711 --> 02:28:23,711
they,
they're criticized there use terms like 

2750
02:28:23,711 --> 02:28:24,500
we used earlier,
like slut or whore,

2751
02:28:24,920 --> 02:28:25,610
you know,
there's no,

2752
02:28:26,030 --> 02:28:28,610
you call a man a mail slot.
They'll start laughing.

2753
02:28:28,660 --> 02:28:29,990
He up.
That's me,

2754
02:28:29,991 --> 02:28:32,420
dude.
Like men don't give a fuck about that.

2755
02:28:32,421 --> 02:28:34,190
It's not,
it's not stigmatized,

2756
02:28:34,640 --> 02:28:36,440
but somehow or another through our 
culture,

2757
02:28:36,441 --> 02:28:41,441
it's stigmatized for women.
And then the idea of masturbation is 

2758
02:28:41,441 --> 02:28:41,441
stigmatized.
These,

2759
02:28:41,441 --> 02:28:46,241
all these different things that we,
our puritan roots of our society starts 

2760
02:28:46,481 --> 02:28:51,481
showing and our religious ideology 
starts showing when we discuss our,

2761
02:28:53,930 --> 02:28:56,080
our issues that we have with sex and 
pornography.

2762
02:28:56,110 --> 02:28:57,850
All right,
and for me,

2763
02:28:57,851 --> 02:29:02,851
this is something I think about a little
bit because my dream is to create an 

2764
02:29:03,671 --> 02:29:08,671
artificial intelligence,
the human centered artificial 

2765
02:29:08,671 --> 02:29:08,671
intelligence system that provides a 
deep,

2766
02:29:08,671 --> 02:29:10,570
meaningful connection with another human
being.

2767
02:29:11,440 --> 02:29:16,440
And you have to consider the fact that 
pornography or sex dolls will be part of

2768
02:29:18,491 --> 02:29:23,491
the journey somehow in society.
Something you're the dummy they'll be 

2769
02:29:23,491 --> 02:29:27,211
using for martial arts would likely to 
be in our development of,

2770
02:29:27,911 --> 02:29:28,990
uh,
of sex robots.

2771
02:29:28,991 --> 02:29:33,991
And we have to think about what's the 
impact of those kinds of robots on 

2772
02:29:33,991 --> 02:29:33,991
society.

2773
02:29:33,991 --> 02:29:37,970
But women in particular are violently 
opposed to sex robots.

2774
02:29:38,030 --> 02:29:38,780
I've read,
uh,

2775
02:29:38,781 --> 02:29:43,781
read a couple articles written by women 
about sex robots and the possibility of 

2776
02:29:43,911 --> 02:29:47,420
future sex robots and the,
I shouldn't say violently,

2777
02:29:47,600 --> 02:29:52,600
but it's always negative.
So is the idea that men would want to 

2778
02:29:52,600 --> 02:29:56,141
have sex with some beautiful thing 
that's programmed to love them as 

2779
02:29:56,141 --> 02:30:00,881
opposed to earning the love of a woman,
but you don't hear that same 

2780
02:30:00,881 --> 02:30:03,500
interpretation from men,
from men.

2781
02:30:03,620 --> 02:30:08,620
It's,
it seems to be that there's a thought 

2782
02:30:08,620 --> 02:30:08,690
about,
maybe it's Kinda Gross,

2783
02:30:08,930 --> 02:30:11,260
but also that it's inevitable and that,
uh,

2784
02:30:11,300 --> 02:30:12,740
and then there's like this,
uh,

2785
02:30:12,910 --> 02:30:17,910
like sort of nod to it.
Like how crazy would that be if you had 

2786
02:30:17,910 --> 02:30:21,371
the perfect woman like the red,
the woman in the red dress in the 

2787
02:30:21,371 --> 02:30:21,371
matrix?
Yeah.

2788
02:30:21,371 --> 02:30:22,370
But it comes over to your house and 
she's perfect

2789
02:30:22,500 --> 02:30:24,390
because you're not thinking about the 
alternative,

2790
02:30:24,391 --> 02:30:29,391
which is a male robot doll,
which will now be able to satisfy your 

2791
02:30:29,391 --> 02:30:34,191
girlfriend wife better than you.
I think you'll hear from guys a lot more

2792
02:30:34,501 --> 02:30:34,860
than,

2793
02:30:35,650 --> 02:30:39,370
um,
maybe or maybe start competing with her.

2794
02:30:39,371 --> 02:30:42,430
She's fucking annoying.
She's always yelling at me.

2795
02:30:42,660 --> 02:30:45,160
Let her yell at the robot.
He doesn't know he's not going to care.

2796
02:30:45,910 --> 02:30:48,040
Then that robot turns into grappling.
Yeah.

2797
02:30:48,041 --> 02:30:50,830
And maybe she can just go ahead and get 
fat with the robot.

2798
02:30:50,831 --> 02:30:52,730
He's not even even care.
Go ahead.

2799
02:30:53,350 --> 02:30:55,450
Just sit around each cheetos all day and
screaming at him.

2800
02:30:55,451 --> 02:30:56,350
He's your,
he's your,

2801
02:30:56,430 --> 02:30:57,850
your slave.
Good.

2802
02:30:59,570 --> 02:31:01,330
I mean,
he could work both ways,

2803
02:31:01,331 --> 02:31:06,331
right?
It can work the same way that a man 

2804
02:31:06,331 --> 02:31:06,331
would,
uh,

2805
02:31:06,331 --> 02:31:11,310
you know,
a woman would see a man that is 

2806
02:31:11,310 --> 02:31:12,480
interested in a sex robot to be 
disgusting,

2807
02:31:12,490 --> 02:31:17,490
pathetic.
A man could see the same thing in a 

2808
02:31:17,490 --> 02:31:17,770
woman that's interested in a sex robot 
like,

2809
02:31:17,771 --> 02:31:18,280
okay,
this,

2810
02:31:18,300 --> 02:31:23,300
that is that what you want,
do some crude thing that just wants 

2811
02:31:23,300 --> 02:31:23,970
physical pleasure and you don't even 
care about a real,

2812
02:31:23,971 --> 02:31:27,600
actual emotional connection to a 
biological human being like,

2813
02:31:27,601 --> 02:31:32,601
okay,
well then you're not my kind of woman 

2814
02:31:32,601 --> 02:31:32,601
anyway.

2815
02:31:32,601 --> 02:31:33,070
And uh,
but if done well,

2816
02:31:33,130 --> 02:31:35,710
those are the kinds of,
in terms of threats of Ai,

2817
02:31:36,070 --> 02:31:41,070
to me,
if you can change the fabric of society 

2818
02:31:41,070 --> 02:31:41,070
because like I'm old school in that 
sense.

2819
02:31:41,070 --> 02:31:41,640
I,
I,

2820
02:31:41,790 --> 02:31:43,810
I like monogamy.
For example,

2821
02:31:44,400 --> 02:31:46,150
you know,
when you say that because you don't have

2822
02:31:46,151 --> 02:31:50,150
a girlfriend,
monogamy one is,

2823
02:31:50,310 --> 02:31:55,310
one is better.
Well now the real reason and have a a 

2824
02:31:55,310 --> 02:31:59,191
girlfriend is because it is fascinated 
with people like you would with the 

2825
02:31:59,600 --> 02:32:00,640
time.
Yes.

2826
02:32:01,020 --> 02:32:06,020
Is a huge challenge because because of 
how much your romantic I am because how 

2827
02:32:06,020 --> 02:32:09,841
much I care about people around me.
I feel like it's a significant 

2828
02:32:09,841 --> 02:32:10,720
investment in time and also the amount 
of work that you do.

2829
02:32:10,940 --> 02:32:15,940
I mean if you're.
If you're dedicated to a passion like 

2830
02:32:15,940 --> 02:32:19,511
artificial intelligence and the sheer 
amount of fucking studying and research

2831
02:32:21,110 --> 02:32:24,350
and programming to certain disciplines 
in which you have to.

2832
02:32:24,920 --> 02:32:29,920
Certain disciplines require.
Like Steven pressfield talks about 

2833
02:32:29,920 --> 02:32:29,920
writing.
You can get pretty far with two,

2834
02:32:29,920 --> 02:32:31,970
three hours a day when you're 
programming,

2835
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:33,980
when you see a lot of the engineering 
tasks,

2836
02:32:34,400 --> 02:32:36,890
they just take up hours.
It's just hard,

2837
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:41,790
which is why I really wanted one of the 
reasons I may disagree with all,

2838
02:32:41,820 --> 02:32:46,820
well a bunch of things,
but he's an inspiration because I think 

2839
02:32:46,820 --> 02:32:46,820
he's a pretty good dad.
Right?

2840
02:32:47,220 --> 02:32:52,220
And he finds the time for his sons while
being probably an order of magnitude 

2841
02:32:52,431 --> 02:32:55,790
busier than I am and it's fascinating to
me how that's possible.

2842
02:32:56,240 --> 02:32:58,940
Well,
once you have children,

2843
02:32:58,970 --> 02:33:01,460
I mean there obviously are people that 
are bad dads,

2844
02:33:01,940 --> 02:33:06,110
but once you have children,
your life shifts in an almost.

2845
02:33:07,260 --> 02:33:07,730
It's

2846
02:33:08,160 --> 02:33:11,610
indescribable way because you're.
You're different.

2847
02:33:11,611 --> 02:33:16,611
It's not just that your life is 
different when you have a child like 

2848
02:33:16,611 --> 02:33:16,680
your Deli.
There hasn't been a moment while we were

2849
02:33:16,681 --> 02:33:19,260
having this conversation that I haven't 
been thinking about my children,

2850
02:33:19,610 --> 02:33:21,240
thinking about what they're doing,
where they are.

2851
02:33:21,241 --> 02:33:24,300
It's always running in the background.
It's a part of life.

2852
02:33:24,680 --> 02:33:29,680
You're,
you're connected to these people that 

2853
02:33:29,680 --> 02:33:33,411
you love so much and they rely on you 
for guidance and for,

2854
02:33:34,290 --> 02:33:39,290
for warmth and affection and but how did
you left have to change your life?

2855
02:33:40,920 --> 02:33:42,150
You just changed.
Man.

2856
02:33:42,151 --> 02:33:43,830
When you see the baby,
you change.

2857
02:33:43,890 --> 02:33:45,540
When you,
when you start feeding them,

2858
02:33:45,541 --> 02:33:46,920
you change.
When you hold them,

2859
02:33:46,921 --> 02:33:47,940
you change.
When you,

2860
02:33:48,260 --> 02:33:50,820
you hold their hand while they walk,
you change.

2861
02:33:51,030 --> 02:33:52,630
When they ask you questions,
you change.

2862
02:33:52,631 --> 02:33:54,330
When they laugh and Giggle,
you change.

2863
02:33:54,331 --> 02:33:56,610
When they smack in the face and you 
pretend to fall down,

2864
02:33:56,611 --> 02:33:58,200
they laugh,
you change,

2865
02:33:59,110 --> 02:34:00,500
you just change,
man.

2866
02:34:00,540 --> 02:34:03,000
You change.
You become a different thing,

2867
02:34:03,001 --> 02:34:08,001
you become a dad,
so you almost can't help but the people 

2868
02:34:08,001 --> 02:34:08,700
do help,
but though that's what's sad.

2869
02:34:09,120 --> 02:34:10,410
Some people resist it.
I mean,

2870
02:34:10,420 --> 02:34:13,830
I know people that have been terrible,
terrible parents.

2871
02:34:14,130 --> 02:34:19,130
They just,
they'd rather stay out all night and 

2872
02:34:19,130 --> 02:34:19,990
never come and they don't want to take 
care of their kids and they get,

2873
02:34:20,450 --> 02:34:25,450
they split up with the wife or the 
girlfriend who's got the kid and they 

2874
02:34:25,450 --> 02:34:27,790
don't give child support and it's a 
really common theme and I mean there's a

2875
02:34:27,791 --> 02:34:30,130
lot of men out there that don't pay 
child support.

2876
02:34:30,160 --> 02:34:32,830
That's a dark,
dark thing.

2877
02:34:33,220 --> 02:34:36,340
You have a child out there that needs 
food and you don't want.

2878
02:34:36,341 --> 02:34:39,220
You're so fucking selfish.
You don't want to provide resources.

2879
02:34:39,340 --> 02:34:41,440
Not only do you not want to be there for
companionship,

2880
02:34:41,680 --> 02:34:45,130
you don't want to provide resources to 
pay for the child's food.

2881
02:34:45,370 --> 02:34:47,020
You don't feel responsible for it.
I mean,

2882
02:34:47,021 --> 02:34:52,021
that was my case when I was a kid.
My Dad didn't pay child support and we 

2883
02:34:52,021 --> 02:34:56,311
were very poor.
It's one of the reasons why we were so 

2884
02:34:56,311 --> 02:34:58,060
poor and I know other people that have 
that same experience,

2885
02:34:58,570 --> 02:35:03,570
so it's not everyone that becomes a 
father or that impregnates I should say 

2886
02:35:04,481 --> 02:35:08,440
a woman and becomes a and the other side
is true too.

2887
02:35:08,441 --> 02:35:11,680
There's women that are terrible mothers 
for whatever reason.

2888
02:35:11,900 --> 02:35:14,110
I mean maybe they're broken 
psychologically.

2889
02:35:14,111 --> 02:35:16,480
Maybe they have mental health issues 
when whatever it is.

2890
02:35:16,660 --> 02:35:20,230
There's some women that are fucking 
terrible moms and it's sad,

2891
02:35:20,500 --> 02:35:23,110
but it makes you appreciate women that 
are great mom so much more.

2892
02:35:23,700 --> 02:35:28,700
You know,
when I see guys like you at the 

2893
02:35:28,700 --> 02:35:30,880
inspiration is some looking for sort of 
structural.

2894
02:35:30,910 --> 02:35:33,460
What's the process to then fit people 
into your life?

2895
02:35:33,820 --> 02:35:37,660
But what I hear is when it happens,
you just do.

2896
02:35:37,760 --> 02:35:39,430
You can always put that this is the 
thing,

2897
02:35:39,431 --> 02:35:40,780
man,
we're not living in a book.

2898
02:35:41,110 --> 02:35:43,090
We're not living in a movie.
It doesn't always happen.

2899
02:35:43,390 --> 02:35:48,390
Like you have to decide that you want it
to happen and you got to go looking for 

2900
02:35:48,390 --> 02:35:50,830
it because if you don't,
you could just be older and still alone.

2901
02:35:50,860 --> 02:35:55,860
Time goes.
A lot of my friends that have never had 

2902
02:35:55,860 --> 02:35:55,860
kids and now they're in their fifties.
I mean comedians.

2903
02:35:56,320 --> 02:35:59,080
You have to be on the road a lot,
not just on the road.

2904
02:35:59,110 --> 02:36:02,250
You have to be obsessed with comedy.
Like it's.

2905
02:36:02,280 --> 02:36:07,280
It's got to be something.
You're always writing new jokes because 

2906
02:36:07,280 --> 02:36:10,471
you're always reading a new.
Especially if you put out a special 

2907
02:36:10,471 --> 02:36:10,471
right,
you put like.

2908
02:36:10,471 --> 02:36:10,630
I just did a Netflix special.
It's out now,

2909
02:36:10,631 --> 02:36:13,480
so I'll really have like a half hour new
material.

2910
02:36:13,480 --> 02:36:16,800
That's it and I'm great by the way.
Thank you very much.

2911
02:36:16,801 --> 02:36:20,710
The first special I've washed,
it was actually really weird,

2912
02:36:20,711 --> 02:36:25,300
decided to go on a tangent,
but I've listened to you quite a bit,

2913
02:36:25,301 --> 02:36:30,301
but I've never looked at you doing 
comedy and it was so different because 

2914
02:36:30,750 --> 02:36:34,480
here you're just like Improv,
like a jazz musician here.

2915
02:36:34,481 --> 02:36:37,690
It's like a regular conversation.
The standard was special.

2916
02:36:38,200 --> 02:36:41,260
It was clear like that's like everything
is perfect.

2917
02:36:41,261 --> 02:36:46,261
The timing.
It's like watching you do a different 

2918
02:36:46,261 --> 02:36:46,261
art almost.
It is kind of interesting.

2919
02:36:46,261 --> 02:36:48,490
It's like a song or something.
It's like you don't.

2920
02:36:49,360 --> 02:36:52,720
There's some roofing to it.
There's some improvisation to it,

2921
02:36:52,750 --> 02:36:55,360
but it's also there's a very clear 
structure to it,

2922
02:36:55,630 --> 02:37:00,630
but that's,
that's it's so time intensive and you 

2923
02:37:00,630 --> 02:37:04,261
have to.
You've got to be obsessed with it to 

2924
02:37:04,261 --> 02:37:06,421
continue to do something like that,
so for some people that travel and the 

2925
02:37:06,521 --> 02:37:11,521
road that takes priority over all things
including relationships and then you 

2926
02:37:11,521 --> 02:37:13,180
never really settled down and so you 
never.

2927
02:37:13,270 --> 02:37:15,910
You never have a significant 
relationship with someone that you could

2928
02:37:15,911 --> 02:37:20,911
have a child with and I know many 
friends that are like that and I know 

2929
02:37:20,911 --> 02:37:22,790
friends who have gotten vasectomies 
because they don't want it.

2930
02:37:23,090 --> 02:37:26,120
They liked this life and there's nothing
wrong with that either.

2931
02:37:26,720 --> 02:37:31,720
I always was upset by this notion that 
in order to be a full and complete 

2932
02:37:32,331 --> 02:37:33,950
adult,
you have to have a child.

2933
02:37:34,250 --> 02:37:39,250
You have to be a parent,
and I think even as a parent where I 

2934
02:37:39,250 --> 02:37:40,880
think it's probably one of the most 
significant things in my life,

2935
02:37:41,100 --> 02:37:42,590
I.
I reject that notion.

2936
02:37:42,591 --> 02:37:47,591
I think you could absolutely be a fully 
developed person and an amazing 

2937
02:37:47,591 --> 02:37:51,760
influence in society and amazing 
contributor to your culture and your 

2938
02:37:51,760 --> 02:37:54,290
community without ever having a child.
Whether you're a man or a woman.

2939
02:37:54,320 --> 02:37:57,380
It's entirely possible.
And the idea that it's not as silly.

2940
02:37:57,410 --> 02:38:00,110
Like we're,
we're all different in so many different

2941
02:38:00,111 --> 02:38:00,980
ways,
you know,

2942
02:38:00,981 --> 02:38:02,780
and we contribute in so many different 
ways.

2943
02:38:03,470 --> 02:38:06,080
There's going to be people that are 
obsessed with mathematics is going to be

2944
02:38:06,081 --> 02:38:07,460
people that are obsessed with 
literature,

2945
02:38:07,461 --> 02:38:12,461
that's going to be people that are 
obsessed with music and they don't all 

2946
02:38:12,461 --> 02:38:15,161
have to be the same puck in person 
because you really don't have enough 

2947
02:38:15,161 --> 02:38:15,161
time for it to be the same person you 
know,

2948
02:38:15,161 --> 02:38:19,841
and there's,
there's going to be people that love 

2949
02:38:19,841 --> 02:38:21,581
having children.
They love being a dad or loved being a 

2950
02:38:21,581 --> 02:38:23,741
mom.
And then it's going to be people that 

2951
02:38:23,741 --> 02:38:23,741
don't want to have nothing to do with 
that.

2952
02:38:23,741 --> 02:38:23,741
And they get snipped early and they're 
like,

2953
02:38:23,741 --> 02:38:27,941
fuck off.
I'm going to smoke cigarettes and drink 

2954
02:38:27,941 --> 02:38:28,280
booze and I'm going to fly around the 
world and talk shit.

2955
02:38:28,520 --> 02:38:33,520
And those people are okay to like the 
way we interact with each other.

2956
02:38:34,311 --> 02:38:39,311
That's most important.
That's what I think the way human 

2957
02:38:39,311 --> 02:38:42,980
beings,
the way we form bonds and friendships,

2958
02:38:42,981 --> 02:38:46,250
the way we,
we contribute to each other's lives,

2959
02:38:46,280 --> 02:38:47,900
the way we,
we,

2960
02:38:47,930 --> 02:38:52,610
we find our passion and create those 
things are what's really important.

2961
02:38:53,740 --> 02:38:55,870
Yeah.
But there's also an element just looking

2962
02:38:55,871 --> 02:38:57,520
at my parents,
I think they got,

2963
02:38:57,521 --> 02:38:59,500
they're still together to garden 
together.

2964
02:38:59,501 --> 02:39:01,090
What it means,
standards.

2965
02:39:01,091 --> 02:39:03,790
You get together when you're like 20 or 
I should know this,

2966
02:39:03,791 --> 02:39:08,791
but 23 slash 20 whatever young.
And there is an element there where you 

2967
02:39:08,791 --> 02:39:11,740
don't want to be too rational.
He just want to just dive in.

2968
02:39:11,890 --> 02:39:14,020
Right.
Should you be an MMA fighter?

2969
02:39:14,050 --> 02:39:16,290
Should you be like,
I'm,

2970
02:39:16,360 --> 02:39:18,620
I'm an academia now.
Uh,

2971
02:39:18,630 --> 02:39:22,150
so I'm a research scientist at Mit.
The pay is much,

2972
02:39:22,151 --> 02:39:26,110
much lower than all the offers I'm 
getting nonstop as it rational.

2973
02:39:26,470 --> 02:39:29,070
I don't know what your passion

2974
02:39:29,080 --> 02:39:31,060
it is doing what you're doing currently.

2975
02:39:31,190 --> 02:39:32,570
Yeah.
But it's like,

2976
02:39:32,571 --> 02:39:33,110
it's

2977
02:39:33,150 --> 02:39:38,150
what are the other offers?
Like what kind of other jobs and are 

2978
02:39:38,150 --> 02:39:38,150
they appealing in any way?

2979
02:39:38,150 --> 02:39:38,710
Yeah.
Yeah,

2980
02:39:38,711 --> 02:39:40,570
they're appealing,
so I,

2981
02:39:40,640 --> 02:39:44,590
I'm making a decision that's similar to 
actually getting married,

2982
02:39:45,040 --> 02:39:49,390
which is so the officer,
well I shouldn't call them out,

2983
02:39:49,391 --> 02:39:52,930
but google phase with the usual,
the usual ai research,

2984
02:39:52,960 --> 02:39:57,960
pretty high positions and the I'm a,
just something in me that says I the 

2985
02:40:02,470 --> 02:40:06,220
edge,
the chaos of this environment and mit is

2986
02:40:06,221 --> 02:40:09,970
something I'm drawn to.
It doesn't make sense so I could do what

2987
02:40:09,971 --> 02:40:13,060
I'm passionate about on a lot of places.
You just kind of dive in.

2988
02:40:13,280 --> 02:40:18,280
Navis,
I had a sense that a lot of our culture 

2989
02:40:18,280 --> 02:40:18,960
creates that momentum and you just kinda
have to go with it.

2990
02:40:19,290 --> 02:40:23,880
And that's why my parents got together 
like a lot of people there probably.

2991
02:40:24,600 --> 02:40:29,600
I mean a lot of couples wouldn't be 
together if they weren't kind of 

2992
02:40:29,600 --> 02:40:31,260
culturally forced to be together in 
divorce was such a negative thing and it

2993
02:40:31,261 --> 02:40:34,740
grew together and we created a super 
happy connection.

2994
02:40:34,750 --> 02:40:39,750
So I'm a little afraid of over 
rationality about choosing the path of 

2995
02:40:39,750 --> 02:40:44,721
life.
So you're saying like monogamy or not 

2996
02:40:44,721 --> 02:40:44,880
monogamy?
Relationship don't always make sense.

2997
02:40:45,500 --> 02:40:47,480
They don't have to make sense.
You know what,

2998
02:40:47,570 --> 02:40:52,570
I think I'm a big believer in doing what
you want to do and if you want to be 

2999
02:40:52,570 --> 02:40:56,480
involved in a monogamous relationship,
I think you should do it,

3000
02:40:56,481 --> 02:40:58,130
but if you don't want to be involved 
one,

3001
02:40:58,131 --> 02:41:00,070
I think you should do that too.
I mean,

3002
02:41:00,080 --> 02:41:05,080
if you want to be like a nomad and 
travel around the world and just live 

3003
02:41:05,080 --> 02:41:08,561
out of a backpack,
I don't think there's anything wrong 

3004
02:41:08,561 --> 02:41:10,781
with that.
As long as you're healthy and you 

3005
02:41:10,781 --> 02:41:12,731
survive and you're not depressed and 
you're not longing for something that 

3006
02:41:12,731 --> 02:41:15,791
you're not participating in,
but I think when you are doing 

3007
02:41:15,791 --> 02:41:16,490
something,
you don't want to be doing it.

3008
02:41:16,910 --> 02:41:20,360
It brings me back to was it throws 
quote.

3009
02:41:20,361 --> 02:41:22,190
I guess I was fuck up.
Who made this?

3010
02:41:22,580 --> 02:41:27,580
What?
I think I know you're most men live 

3011
02:41:27,580 --> 02:41:27,680
lives of silent desperation.

3012
02:41:28,500 --> 02:41:30,560
That's.
That's real man.

3013
02:41:30,680 --> 02:41:32,540
That's real.
That's real.

3014
02:41:32,870 --> 02:41:35,570
That's what you don't want.
I think it's thorough,

3015
02:41:35,580 --> 02:41:39,530
right?
You don't want silent desperation.

3016
02:41:39,531 --> 02:41:39,950
Yeah,
it is.

3017
02:41:39,970 --> 02:41:44,970
Right.
I fucking love that quote because I've 

3018
02:41:44,970 --> 02:41:47,381
seen it.
I've seen it in so many people's faces 

3019
02:41:47,381 --> 02:41:49,451
and that's one thing I've managed to 
avoid and I dunno if I avoided that by 

3020
02:41:49,451 --> 02:41:53,170
luck or just by fact I'm stupid and I 
just,

3021
02:41:53,171 --> 02:41:58,171
I just follow my instincts whether 
they're right or wrong or and I make it 

3022
02:41:58,171 --> 02:42:02,261
work,
but this goes back to what we were 

3023
02:42:02,261 --> 02:42:06,070
discussing when in terms of what is the 
nature of reality and what are these,

3024
02:42:06,530 --> 02:42:11,530
are we just finding these romanticized 
interpretations of our own biological 

3025
02:42:14,001 --> 02:42:19,001
needs and our human reward systems 
that's creating these beautiful visions 

3026
02:42:19,001 --> 02:42:23,231
of what is life and what is important 
poetry and food and music and all the 

3027
02:42:23,231 --> 02:42:27,461
passions and dancing and holding someone
in your arms that you care for deeply 

3028
02:42:27,461 --> 02:42:31,661
and all those things.
Just little tricks or all those little 

3029
02:42:31,661 --> 02:42:35,711
biological tricks in order just to keep,
keep on this very strange dance of human

3030
02:42:36,621 --> 02:42:41,621
civilization so that we can keep on 
creating new and better products that 

3031
02:42:41,621 --> 02:42:46,331
keep on moving innovation towards this 
ultimate eventual goal.

3032
02:42:47,450 --> 02:42:51,290
Artificial intelligence of this giving 
birth to the gods.

3033
02:42:51,320 --> 02:42:52,650
Yeah.
Giving birth to the guns.

3034
02:42:53,400 --> 02:42:54,180
Yeah.
So,

3035
02:42:54,780 --> 02:42:57,000
you know,
I did want to mention one thing about,

3036
02:42:57,040 --> 02:42:59,160
uh,
the one thing I really,

3037
02:42:59,490 --> 02:43:04,490
I don't understand fully,
but I've been thinking about for the 

3038
02:43:04,490 --> 02:43:06,480
last couple of years at the application 
of artificial intelligence to,

3039
02:43:06,710 --> 02:43:11,710
into politics.
I've heard you talked about sort of a 

3040
02:43:11,740 --> 02:43:13,840
government being broken in the sense 
that one guy,

3041
02:43:14,020 --> 02:43:16,000
one president that doesn't make any 
sense.

3042
02:43:16,810 --> 02:43:18,940
I see you,
you get like,

3043
02:43:19,470 --> 02:43:23,980
you know,
people get hundreds of millions of likes

3044
02:43:23,981 --> 02:43:28,981
on their facebook pictures and uh,
instagram and we're always voting with 

3045
02:43:28,981 --> 02:43:33,661
our fingers every single day.
And yet for the election process it 

3046
02:43:33,661 --> 02:43:37,651
seems that we're voting like once every 
four years it feels like this new 

3047
02:43:37,841 --> 02:43:42,841
technology could bring about a world 
where the voice of the people can be 

3048
02:43:42,841 --> 02:43:47,401
heard on a daily basis.
Like where you could speak about the 

3049
02:43:47,401 --> 02:43:50,580
issues you care about,
whether it's gun control and abortion,

3050
02:43:50,770 --> 02:43:51,850
all of these topics that are.
So,

3051
02:43:51,851 --> 02:43:56,851
he so debated.
It feels like there needs to be an 

3052
02:43:56,851 --> 02:43:57,820
instagram for elections.
I agree.

3053
02:43:58,310 --> 02:44:03,310
And I think there's room for that.
I've been thinking about how to write a 

3054
02:44:03,310 --> 02:44:04,390
few papers are proposing different 
technologies.

3055
02:44:04,660 --> 02:44:09,640
It just feels like the people that are 
playing politics need to our old school

3056
02:44:10,710 --> 02:44:13,800
that is like the influencers,
right?

3057
02:44:13,801 --> 02:44:16,080
If you look at Instagram,
I mean,

3058
02:44:16,170 --> 02:44:21,170
should Nicki Minaj be able to decide how
the world works because she's got the 

3059
02:44:21,601 --> 02:44:23,740
most followers.
Should Kim Kardashians,

3060
02:44:23,970 --> 02:44:28,970
like who's influencing things and why 
and you have to deal with the fickle 

3061
02:44:28,970 --> 02:44:33,021
nature of human beings and do we give 
enough patients towards the decisions of

3062
02:44:35,221 --> 02:44:39,000
these so called leaders that we're 
electing to adored you just decided fuck

3063
02:44:39,001 --> 02:44:44,001
them.
They're out new person in because we 

3064
02:44:44,001 --> 02:44:44,001
have like a really short attention span 
when it comes to think,

3065
02:44:44,001 --> 02:44:46,020
especially today with the new cycles so 
quick,

3066
02:44:46,660 --> 02:44:51,660
so the same process.
So the instagram might be a bad example 

3067
02:44:51,660 --> 02:44:55,171
because yeah,
you get or twitter and you start 

3068
02:44:55,171 --> 02:44:57,280
following Donald Trump or and you start 
to sort of idolize these certain icons 

3069
02:44:57,371 --> 02:44:59,470
that do we necessarily want them to 
represent us?

3070
02:45:00,370 --> 02:45:05,370
I was more thinking about the,
the Amazon product reviews model 

3071
02:45:05,370 --> 02:45:08,170
recommender systems or Netflix,
the movies.

3072
02:45:08,171 --> 02:45:13,171
You've watched the Netflix learning 
enough about you to represent you in 

3073
02:45:14,531 --> 02:45:19,531
your next movie selection.
So in the kind of movies like what do 

3074
02:45:19,531 --> 02:45:23,791
you like [inaudible] Joe Rogan,
what are the kinds of movies that you 

3075
02:45:23,791 --> 02:45:27,631
would like the recommender systems,
these artificial intelligence systems 

3076
02:45:27,631 --> 02:45:31,681
learn based on your netflix election 
that could be deeper understanding of 

3077
02:45:31,781 --> 02:45:36,100
who you are than you're even aware of.
And I think there's that element.

3078
02:45:36,101 --> 02:45:40,030
I'm not sure exactly,
but there's that element of learning who

3079
02:45:40,031 --> 02:45:45,031
you are like,
do you think drugs should be legalized 

3080
02:45:45,031 --> 02:45:45,031
or not?
Like,

3081
02:45:45,031 --> 02:45:48,850
do you think?
I do think immigration,

3082
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,490
should we let everybody in?
I'll keep everybody out.

3083
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:57,000
Should we all.
All of these topics with a red and blue 

3084
02:45:57,000 --> 02:46:01,440
teams now have a hard to answer.
Of course you keep all the immigrants 

3085
02:46:01,440 --> 02:46:03,430
out or of course you need to be more 
compassionate of course,

3086
02:46:03,970 --> 02:46:08,970
but for most people is really a gray 
area and exploring gray area.

3087
02:46:09,790 --> 02:46:10,070
The way

3088
02:46:10,070 --> 02:46:12,590
you would explore the gray area of 
Netflix.

3089
02:46:12,591 --> 02:46:17,591
What is the next movie or watching?
Do you want to watch the Little Mermaid 

3090
02:46:17,591 --> 02:46:18,330
or a godfather?
To me,

3091
02:46:18,640 --> 02:46:21,290
what that process of understanding who 
you are.

3092
02:46:21,291 --> 02:46:24,650
I just.
It feels like that there's room for that

3093
02:46:24,651 --> 02:46:25,300
in our other problem.

3094
02:46:25,330 --> 02:46:30,330
Home is of course that you have.
There's grave consequences to these 

3095
02:46:30,330 --> 02:46:34,831
decisions that you're going to make in 
terms of the way it affects the 

3096
02:46:34,831 --> 02:46:37,681
community and you might not have any 
information that you're basing this on 

3097
02:46:37,811 --> 02:46:39,830
at all.
You might be basing all these decisions,

3098
02:46:39,831 --> 02:46:43,960
decisions on misinformation,
propaganda,

3099
02:46:43,990 --> 02:46:47,980
nonsense advertising.
You'll be easily influenced.

3100
02:46:48,220 --> 02:46:49,870
You might not have looked into it at 
all.

3101
02:46:49,871 --> 02:46:54,871
You can be ignorant about the subject 
and it might just appeal to certain 

3102
02:46:54,871 --> 02:46:57,760
dynamics that have been programmed into 
your brain because you grew up religious

3103
02:46:57,761 --> 02:47:00,540
or you grew up in an atheist or you 
know.

3104
02:47:00,610 --> 02:47:05,610
The real problem is whether or not 
people are educated about the 

3105
02:47:05,610 --> 02:47:07,330
consequences of these decisions.
We're going to see information.

3106
02:47:07,331 --> 02:47:09,580
Yeah,
and then I think,

3107
02:47:11,060 --> 02:47:16,060
I mean,
I think there's going to be a time in 

3108
02:47:16,060 --> 02:47:20,371
our,
in our life where our ability to access 

3109
02:47:20,371 --> 02:47:23,851
information is many steps better than it
is now with smartphones.

3110
02:47:25,330 --> 02:47:30,330
I think we're going like Elon Musk has 
some neuro link thing that he's working 

3111
02:47:30,330 --> 02:47:30,780
on right now,
is being very vague about it.

3112
02:47:30,790 --> 02:47:35,790
Increase the bandwidth of our human 
interaction with machines is what he's 

3113
02:47:35,790 --> 02:47:35,790
worth.

3114
02:47:35,790 --> 02:47:35,860
Yeah.
I'm.

3115
02:47:36,320 --> 02:47:38,770
I'm very interested to see where this 
leads,

3116
02:47:38,860 --> 02:47:43,270
but I think that we can assume that 
because something like the Internet came

3117
02:47:43,271 --> 02:47:48,100
along and because it's so accessible to 
you and I right now with your phone,

3118
02:47:48,101 --> 02:47:49,540
just pick it up,
say,

3119
02:47:49,541 --> 02:47:51,190
hey google,
what the fuck is this?

3120
02:47:51,550 --> 02:47:56,550
And then you get the.
You get the answer almost 

3121
02:47:56,550 --> 02:47:58,351
instantaneously.
That's gonna change what a person is as 

3122
02:47:58,691 --> 02:48:03,691
that advances and I think we're much 
more likely looking at some sort of a 

3123
02:48:03,691 --> 02:48:07,231
symbiotic connection between us and 
artificial intelligence and computer 

3124
02:48:08,290 --> 02:48:13,290
augmented access to information than we 
are looking at the rise of some 

3125
02:48:14,080 --> 02:48:16,750
artificial being that takes us over and 
fucks are girlfriend.

3126
02:48:18,240 --> 02:48:20,320
Well yeah.
That's the real existential threat.

3127
02:48:20,860 --> 02:48:22,900
Yeah,
I think so.

3128
02:48:22,901 --> 02:48:27,901
That's to me is super exciting.
The phone is a portal to this collective

3129
02:48:28,571 --> 02:48:33,571
that we have this collective 
consciousness and it gives people a 

3130
02:48:33,571 --> 02:48:34,570
voice.
I would say if anyone's like me,

3131
02:48:35,950 --> 02:48:38,950
you really know very little about a 
politicians you're voting for,

3132
02:48:38,951 --> 02:48:43,951
or even the issues like global warming.
I'm embarrassed to say I like,

3133
02:48:45,100 --> 02:48:50,100
I know very little about it,
like if I'm actually being honest with 

3134
02:48:50,100 --> 02:48:50,710
myself,
I've heard different,

3135
02:48:51,530 --> 02:48:56,050
like I know what I'm supposed to believe
as a scientist but actually know nothing

3136
02:48:56,410 --> 02:49:00,630
about concrete and not nothing concrete 
about process about the va,

3137
02:49:00,690 --> 02:49:05,690
the environmental process.
And why is it so certain scientists 

3138
02:49:05,690 --> 02:49:08,040
apparently completely agree.
So as a scientist,

3139
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:13,040
um,
I kinda take on faith oftentimes what 

3140
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:14,040
the community agrees in my own 
discipline I question,

3141
02:49:14,070 --> 02:49:19,070
but outside I just kind of take on faith
and the same thing with a gun control 

3142
02:49:19,381 --> 02:49:24,381
and so on.
You just kind of say which team of my 

3143
02:49:24,381 --> 02:49:24,381
own.
And I'm just going to take that on.

3144
02:49:24,381 --> 02:49:28,310
I just feel like it's such a disruptive 
space to where people could be given 

3145
02:49:28,471 --> 02:49:31,080
just a tiny bit more information to help
them.

3146
02:49:31,260 --> 02:49:33,390
Well maybe that's where something like 
neuro link comes along.

3147
02:49:33,410 --> 02:49:38,410
It just enhances our ability to access 
this stuff in a way that's much more 

3148
02:49:38,550 --> 02:49:43,050
just more tangible than just being able 
to google search it and maybe this,

3149
02:49:43,080 --> 02:49:45,480
this process is something that we really
can't anticipate.

3150
02:49:45,490 --> 02:49:48,390
It's going to have to happen to us.
Just like what we're talking about,

3151
02:49:48,391 --> 02:49:53,391
cell phone images that you could just 
send to Australia with the click of a 

3152
02:49:53,391 --> 02:49:55,290
button that no one would have ever 
anticipated that 300 years ago.

3153
02:49:55,440 --> 02:50:00,440
Maybe we are beyond our.
Our capacity for understanding the 

3154
02:50:01,591 --> 02:50:04,500
impact of all of this stuff.
Maybe kids coming up now.

3155
02:50:04,860 --> 02:50:09,030
What is that world going to look like 
when you're too old to be sitting?

3156
02:50:09,031 --> 02:50:14,031
You'll be like 95 sitting on a porch 
with a shotgun cleaning swing and what 

3157
02:50:14,031 --> 02:50:16,110
do those kids look like when they're 18 
years old?

3158
02:50:16,140 --> 02:50:20,850
Robots fucking x Ray vision and they 
could read minds.

3159
02:50:20,851 --> 02:50:22,350
Yeah,
well yoga is going to happen.

3160
02:50:22,510 --> 02:50:25,260
They'd be saying,
robots are everywhere these days.

3161
02:50:25,261 --> 02:50:28,620
Back back in my day,
we used to put robots in their place.

3162
02:50:29,920 --> 02:50:34,410
They were serving.
Shut them off and now fuck your mom.

3163
02:50:35,590 --> 02:50:37,530
Now they want to go to the same school 
as us.

3164
02:50:38,070 --> 02:50:39,330
Yeah.
And they want to.

3165
02:50:39,360 --> 02:50:41,110
They want to run for president.
You know,

3166
02:50:42,170 --> 02:50:43,650
they want to run for president.
Yeah.

3167
02:50:43,651 --> 02:50:48,651
They're more compassionate and smarter,
but we still hate them because they 

3168
02:50:48,651 --> 02:50:48,651
don't go to the bathroom.

3169
02:50:48,651 --> 02:50:50,040
Yeah.
Well now we half the country,

3170
02:50:50,041 --> 02:50:55,041
look at them and the other love them and
Abraham Lincoln character will come 

3171
02:50:55,041 --> 02:50:56,020
along.
That's what I'm pitching myself.

3172
02:50:56,770 --> 02:51:01,770
I'm telling you,
you Lincoln of the robot world of the 

3173
02:51:01,770 --> 02:51:04,130
robot world,
that's the speeches that everybody 

3174
02:51:04,130 --> 02:51:07,401
quotes in.
One other thing I got to say about 

3175
02:51:07,401 --> 02:51:07,401
academia.
Okay?

3176
02:51:08,280 --> 02:51:13,280
In defense of academia,
so you've had a lot of really smart 

3177
02:51:13,280 --> 02:51:15,330
people on including Sam Harris and uh,
Jordan Peterson.

3178
02:51:15,600 --> 02:51:19,920
And often the word academia is used to 
replace a certain concept.

3179
02:51:20,520 --> 02:51:25,520
So I'm part of academia and most of 
academia is engineering is biology,

3180
02:51:25,831 --> 02:51:30,831
is medicine is hard sciences.
The humanities that are slippery.

3181
02:51:31,260 --> 02:51:36,260
Exactly in humanity.
And I think a subset of humanities that 

3182
02:51:36,260 --> 02:51:36,430
I know nothing about.
And there a subset.

3183
02:51:36,431 --> 02:51:38,130
I don't want to speak about gender 
studies.

3184
02:51:38,131 --> 02:51:43,130
Say it.
I don't know man.

3185
02:51:43,180 --> 02:51:46,500
Candy man.
I actually live on Harvard campus,

3186
02:51:46,920 --> 02:51:51,920
so I go to mit,
but I live on Harvard campus and yet is 

3187
02:51:51,920 --> 02:51:53,130
there.
They have apartments for you guys.

3188
02:51:53,131 --> 02:51:54,300
How does that work?
Yeah,

3189
02:51:54,301 --> 02:51:55,830
they hand them out as.
No,

3190
02:51:55,920 --> 02:51:58,200
I just,
I don't care to live on the campus.

3191
02:51:58,201 --> 02:51:58,980
What do you mean?
Uh,

3192
02:51:58,981 --> 02:52:01,170
sorry.
Like in Harvard Square.

3193
02:52:01,380 --> 02:52:06,380
Oh,
Harvard Square in Cambridge and 

3194
02:52:06,380 --> 02:52:06,380
Cambridge.
Yeah.

3195
02:52:06,380 --> 02:52:06,380
Yeah.
So I,

3196
02:52:06,380 --> 02:52:06,380
I used go to catch a rising

3197
02:52:06,380 --> 02:52:10,980
star when it existed.
They used to be a great comedy club in 

3198
02:52:10,980 --> 02:52:10,980
Cambridge.
There's a few.

3199
02:52:10,980 --> 02:52:11,380
There's a few good comedy clubs there.
Right.

3200
02:52:11,690 --> 02:52:14,170
Well there's a Chinese restaurant that 
uh,

3201
02:52:14,500 --> 02:52:17,860
that has stand up there still.
How does that work?

3202
02:52:17,861 --> 02:52:18,790
Well,
it's upstairs.

3203
02:52:18,791 --> 02:52:21,100
There's like this,
a comedy club up there.

3204
02:52:21,520 --> 02:52:22,600
Yeah.
Do you ever,

3205
02:52:23,330 --> 02:52:28,330
ever,
because you've done your specialist in 

3206
02:52:28,330 --> 02:52:28,330
Boston?
Yes,

3207
02:52:28,330 --> 02:52:28,330
I did.
At the Wilbur theater.

3208
02:52:28,330 --> 02:52:32,460
Have you ever considered just going back
to Boston and doing like that Chinese 

3209
02:52:32,460 --> 02:52:32,460
restaurant?
The Ding Ho?

3210
02:52:32,460 --> 02:52:37,000
Yeah.
That was before my time when I came 

3211
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:37,000
around.
I started in 1988.

3212
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:38,890
The Ding Ho had already ended,
but I,

3213
02:52:38,891 --> 02:52:41,440
you know,
I got to be friends with guys like Lenny

3214
02:52:41,440 --> 02:52:46,170
Clarke and Tony v and all these people 
that told me about the ding ho and Kenny

3215
02:52:46,170 --> 02:52:51,170
Rogers and the comics that were in Barry
Crimmins who just passed away rest in 

3216
02:52:51,701 --> 02:52:52,660
peace,
uh,

3217
02:52:52,690 --> 02:52:57,690
who was really the Godfather,
that whole scene and one of the major 

3218
02:52:57,690 --> 02:53:01,651
reasons why that scene was so had such 
really some rock solid morals and ethics

3219
02:53:07,091 --> 02:53:10,420
when it came to the creation of material
and standards.

3220
02:53:10,750 --> 02:53:13,300
It was a lot of it was barry crimmins 
because he was just a,

3221
02:53:13,960 --> 02:53:16,090
that's just who he was as a person,
you know.

3222
02:53:16,470 --> 02:53:18,010
Um,
but that was before my time.

3223
02:53:18,220 --> 02:53:22,300
I came around when I came around like 
four years after that stuff.

3224
02:53:22,570 --> 02:53:26,470
And so there was tons of comedy clubs.
It was everywhere,

3225
02:53:26,471 --> 02:53:28,720
but I just didn't get a chance to be 
around that.

3226
02:53:28,721 --> 02:53:30,340
Uh,
that Ding Ho scene.

3227
02:53:30,430 --> 02:53:33,700
And you stayed in Boston for how many 
before you moved out here?

3228
02:53:34,540 --> 02:53:39,540
I was in New York in a,
by the time I think I was in New York by

3229
02:53:39,611 --> 02:53:42,340
90 to 91.
Ninety two.

3230
02:53:42,341 --> 02:53:45,450
So it was in Boston for four or five 
years doing stand up.

3231
02:53:46,020 --> 02:53:47,970
How'd you get to from Boston to New 
York?

3232
02:53:48,900 --> 02:53:52,810
Met My match on Wendy's.
This opportunity for you to talk about.

3233
02:53:52,811 --> 02:53:57,811
What about Connecticut gets upset at me.
It's become a running theme to talk Shit

3234
02:54:04,141 --> 02:54:06,420
About Connecticut or I've heard you do a
ones.

3235
02:54:07,050 --> 02:54:08,730
I just had a buddy who did a Gig in 
Connecticut.

3236
02:54:08,731 --> 02:54:10,320
He told me was fucking horrible.
I go,

3237
02:54:10,321 --> 02:54:12,780
I told you,
bitch should've listened to me.

3238
02:54:13,020 --> 02:54:15,570
Don't book gigs and Connecticut Fuck's 
wrong with you?

3239
02:54:15,571 --> 02:54:19,740
This 49 other states.
But that's great.

3240
02:54:19,741 --> 02:54:21,630
You go back to Boston and do like small 
gigs.

3241
02:54:21,690 --> 02:54:23,430
Small and sometimes.
Yeah,

3242
02:54:23,431 --> 02:54:24,660
I'll do.
Um,

3243
02:54:26,150 --> 02:54:26,840
yeah,
laugh.

3244
02:54:26,841 --> 02:54:31,841
Boston is a great club.
I used to do nick's comedy stop and all 

3245
02:54:31,841 --> 02:54:33,040
the other ones there.
But I,

3246
02:54:33,041 --> 02:54:33,660
I,
I,

3247
02:54:33,661 --> 02:54:38,661
you know,
I love the Wilbert Wilbert is a great 

3248
02:54:38,661 --> 02:54:38,661
place to perform.
I Love Boston.

3249
02:54:38,661 --> 02:54:40,670
I would live there if it wasn't so 
fucking cold in the winter.

3250
02:54:40,850 --> 02:54:42,410
But that's what keeps people like me 
out.

3251
02:54:42,430 --> 02:54:43,070
Keeps the pussy

3252
02:54:43,330 --> 02:54:44,900
right.
Listen,

3253
02:54:44,901 --> 02:54:46,250
we got to end this.
We got to wrap it up.

3254
02:54:46,251 --> 02:54:49,370
We've already done three hours flies by 
it.

3255
02:54:49,371 --> 02:54:52,670
Did it flew by A.
Can I say to?

3256
02:54:52,810 --> 02:54:53,600
Sure.
Sure.

3257
02:54:53,750 --> 02:54:56,990
So first I got to give a shout out to my
shout out.

3258
02:54:57,110 --> 02:54:58,880
Shout out CEO,
a long,

3259
02:54:58,881 --> 02:55:03,881
long time friend Matt.
Her Randy from Chicago has been there 

3260
02:55:03,881 --> 02:55:03,881
all along.
He's a of the podcast,

3261
02:55:03,881 --> 02:55:05,130
so he's probably listening.
Um,

3262
02:55:05,210 --> 02:55:07,760
him and his wife had just had a 
beautiful baby girl.

3263
02:55:08,060 --> 02:55:13,060
So I want to just send my love to him 
and I told myself I'll ended this way.

3264
02:55:14,270 --> 02:55:16,580
Okay,
let me end it the way he ended it.

3265
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:18,470
Love is the answer.
Love is.

3266
02:55:18,471 --> 02:55:21,110
The answer is probably is unless you're 
a robot.

3267
02:55:22,470 --> 02:55:22,890
Bye.
