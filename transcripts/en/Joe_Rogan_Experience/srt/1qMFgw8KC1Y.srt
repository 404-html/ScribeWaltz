4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,510

6
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,063

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,870
This episode of the podcast is
brought to you by blue apron.

9
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:15,630
Blue Apron is our newest sponsor
and it's a very exciting one.

10
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,960
Blue Apron is a way that you can get
food delivered to your house with recipes

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,400
to cook all the fresh ingredients
delivered to your house.

12
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,211
You don't have to shop,

13
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:28,050
you don't have to do shit.

14
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:29,190
They send it in a cooler.

15
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,031
Here's how it works.

16
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:31,800
For 999 per meal,

17
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,600
they send you all the ingredients in
the exact right proportions with simple

18
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:39,720
recipe instructions right to your door.

19
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:40,883
It's awesome.

20
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,180
I've tried it a couple of times now.

21
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:46,590
It's great the meals or 500
to 700 calories per serving,

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,580
which is pretty low for how delicious
they are and there's a bunch of different

23
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:51,414
options too.

24
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,720
You can get a bunch of different
things that that blue apron provides.

It's Kinda cool because
you do it all yourself.

32
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:10,020
It's like a little project
Maraca and beef 10 gene.

33
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,903

guys did.

56
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:52,690
The way they put it together is,

57
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,090
is really well done too.

58
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,970
They've obviously planned this out
and put a lot of thought into it.

59
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,750
The directions are super easy to follow
and they have pictures like you don't

60
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:05,700
have to like think things through
like a fucking like a dummy like me.

61
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,973

70
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:27,840

You're like most times you like pay
like oh you get 120 minutes per month.

78
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,890
Well if you don't use the
120 minutes per month,

79
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:44,580
what happens?

80
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,180
They don't give you any money back and
if you use it over 120 minutes per month,

81
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,380
you get penalized.

82
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,011

91
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,590

00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,820
this is made for us by caveman coffee.

165
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,220
It is a single estate coffee,

166
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:44,140
which means it's made and produced
in one place and then sold to us.

167
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:44,720
Um,

168
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,020
they,

169
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,821
they roasted,

170
00:05:45,821 --> 00:05:46,421
they pick it,

171
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:48,850
they do the whole Jamey
and a caveman coffee,

172
00:05:48,851 --> 00:05:51,670
which is owned bar buddy Tait
Fletcher and Keith Jardeen,

173
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,080
two excellent human beings.

174
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,243
And um,

175
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,900
we have our own blend.

176
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:57,710
It's a Colombian amber blend,

177
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,750
handcrafted by caveman coffee.

178
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,340
Handcrafted a term I fucking deeply
despise and I'm getting really sick of

179
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,400
seeing handcrafted beverages.

180
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:07,851
You know,

181
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:10,580
like handcrafted cocktails
are handcrafted burger.

182
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:14,270
Fuck you just shut up with
your handcrafted anyway.

183
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:14,991
Uh,

184
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:16,160
are handcrafted coffees.

185
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:16,580
Awesome.

186
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,413
Did I mention that?

187
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,250
Go to [inaudible] dot com it's o,

Get yourself in shape and
use the codeword Rogan.

192
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,380
Why?

193
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,940
Fuck around ladies and gentlemen,

194
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:31,940
Young Jim Norton is here and we're
going to get down to the nitty gritty.

195
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,230
Critical to you getting ready.

196
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,150
The Joe Rogan experience.

197
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,420
Joe Rogan podcast by night.

198
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,050
What a week young Jim
Norton has had what a week?

199
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,340
Yes.

200
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:49,870
What a week.

201
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:54,540
Sirius satellite radio has had
what a week censorship has had.

202
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,411
What a week.

203
00:06:55,411 --> 00:06:57,510
Anthony Kumina has had what a week.

204
00:06:57,511 --> 00:06:59,520
All the people online,

205
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:03,570
they love the bitch and Piss and Moan
and complain and get very excited when

206
00:07:03,571 --> 00:07:05,040
something fucked up goes down.

207
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,610
Yeah.

208
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,630
Well something fucked up.

209
00:07:06,631 --> 00:07:07,860
Went down when,

210
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:08,910
if you're listening to this,

211
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:09,110
if,

212
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,770
if at sometime in the future,

213
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,280
uh,

214
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,770
cause these recordings
will be saved forever.

215
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:18,000
This is today's date is July 17th,

216
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,190
2014 approximately a week go Anthony Ku.

217
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:21,660
Mia was taken photographs,

218
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,460
Anthony of the opiate Anthony Show,

219
00:07:23,461 --> 00:07:28,461
which our pal Jim Norton is also a part
of was he was downtown in New York,

220
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,850
taken some photographs.

221
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,670
And from there on it's a bunch of,

222
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:37,730
you know what he says and what I'm sure
the woman who beat the shit out of them

223
00:07:37,951 --> 00:07:38,910
would have a different story.

224
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,800
But he was taking some photographs.

225
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,460
One of,

226
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,350
one of the photographs was of this,

227
00:07:43,351 --> 00:07:43,890
uh,

228
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,300
what are those things called when you,

229
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:45,780
uh,

230
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,000
those things we look at staffing,

231
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:48,840
scaffolding,

232
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,890
who's walking through the scaffolding?

233
00:07:49,891 --> 00:07:51,120
A woman was coming towards him.

234
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,000
It looked like he was just taking
a bunch of cool photos of New York.

235
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:56,340
There's a bunch of them that
he put up on his Instagram.

236
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:56,580
Yeah.

237
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:56,881
Anyway,

238
00:07:56,881 --> 00:08:00,360
this woman got upset that he
was taking a photo of her,

239
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,890
probably thought that he was perving,

240
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:02,560
um,

241
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,570
got mad at them,

242
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,770
violence ensued.

243
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,800
She hit him and he went on Twitter
and went on this rant about violence,

244
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:15,060
about the black community and their
propensity for violence about this woman

245
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,350
calling her an animal,

246
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,500
but what she did and a serious fired
him and which left a fucking huge hole.

247
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,710
And uh,

248
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,970
my entertainment world,

249
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,391
uh,

250
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:24,871
the opiate,

251
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,850
Anthony shows my all
time favorite radio show.

252
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:30,480
I listened to it all the time and
now all of a sudden it is no more.

253
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:31,710
Yeah,

254
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:32,341
it's a,

255
00:08:32,341 --> 00:08:32,740
you know,

256
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,130
it's,

257
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,170
it's a huge hole too.

258
00:08:34,171 --> 00:08:35,310
Like I no one panicked.

259
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:38,250
Like may cause opie and Anthony
both have kind of fuck you money.

260
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,240
Jim Norton doesn't.

261
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,650
So selfishly thinking,

262
00:08:40,651 --> 00:08:40,981
I'm like,

263
00:08:40,981 --> 00:08:44,310
well there goes everything
because the show done well.

264
00:08:44,311 --> 00:08:47,220
You are always going to be great because
you're a funny comic and you can always

265
00:08:47,221 --> 00:08:49,080
work and you never have
to worry about that.

266
00:08:49,081 --> 00:08:50,400
But um,

267
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,380
it is a crazy thing,

268
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:53,883
uh,

269
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:54,450
that,

270
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:54,781
you know,

271
00:08:54,781 --> 00:08:56,040
all of a sudden like

272
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,820
that for things that he said
on the show a hundred times.

273
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:00,761
I think what happened,

274
00:09:00,761 --> 00:09:01,140
I started,

275
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,460
I think what happened was he tweeted,

276
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,390
like he told,

277
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:05,580
I talked to him multiple times since then.

278
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,700
He was walking and people don't believe
that he was actually taking legitimate

279
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:09,481
in New York photos.

280
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:10,890
That was one of the points of contention.

281
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:12,510
People like he was being creepy,

282
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,720
but he really wasn't like Anthony has
had this giant Hubble like camera in the

283
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:22,110
studio every day for probably six months
now he's getting into photography.

284
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:23,130
It's what he's been doing.

285
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,110
So that was not unusual at all to hear.

286
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:26,670
He was out and about taking photos.

287
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:27,504
That's legit.

288
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,830
And I guess this woman got angry and I
talked to him and he said that she just

289
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:32,341
said something like,

290
00:09:32,341 --> 00:09:32,610
you,

291
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,390
you know this white boys,

292
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:33,931
take my picture,

293
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:34,620
you white motherfucker,

294
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:34,830
whatever.

295
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,850
She said she clocked him and
he kept defending himself.

296
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,440
And as he's putting his arms up,

297
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,640
she is going,

298
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,060
um,

299
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,230
don't touch me.

300
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:43,861
Like,

301
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:44,011
you know,

302
00:09:44,011 --> 00:09:47,100
that thing like that a woman might
do to prevent you from hitting her,

303
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:47,340
like,

304
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,650
and you could see how
frightening that would be.

305
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,600
Cause then then people think
you're beating on this woman.

306
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,110
Right.

307
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,850
So he's putting his hand up and you know,

308
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:56,370
I know him well enough to know he's
not going to just punch a woman in the

309
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:57,180
phase.

310
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,050
So she's doing that.

311
00:09:58,051 --> 00:10:00,920
And I think a few black guys came around
and they didn't do anything to amp,

312
00:10:00,921 --> 00:10:01,411
but they were like,

313
00:10:01,411 --> 00:10:01,561
you know,

314
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:02,400
don't touch her.

315
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,451
So,

316
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:03,841
um,

317
00:10:03,841 --> 00:10:04,051
you know,

318
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:06,600
and who has always armed
and he's licensed to carry,

319
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:07,500
um,

320
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,333
didn't hit her.

321
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,760
It didn't pull out his pistol and a went
home and I guess was really upset and

322
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:15,961
went out on,

323
00:10:15,961 --> 00:10:16,351
like you said,

324
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:18,480
a Twitter rampage.

325
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,321
And,

326
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:20,154
um,

327
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,270
I knew it was bad the next morning when
I saw it because my ex girlfriend called

328
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:25,290
me and she's like,

329
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,111
what happened with Anthony?

330
00:10:26,111 --> 00:10:27,940
He got beat up by a woman and there,

331
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,411
I don't know.

332
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:30,640
So I looked and I saw the tweets.

333
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:30,931
I'm like,

334
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:31,230
Oh,

335
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,340
I actually texted him about one.

336
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:33,450
I don't think I've ever done that before.

337
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,120
There was one that I texted her around
that comes that you all right man,

338
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,900
does it?

339
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,171
He's like,

340
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:37,381
yeah,

341
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:37,771
I'm fine.

342
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:38,604
I'm gonna Cocoa.

343
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,983
It was scary.

344
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:40,883
Wow.

345
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:41,910
Um,

346
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,301
yeah.

347
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:42,740
The,

348
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,740
the thing about aunt is he's developed
this sort of style of communicating on

349
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:52,260
the show where he goes on these long,

350
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,280
hilarious,

351
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,120
entertaining profanity filled rants.

352
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,970
And there's one thing about hearing it,

353
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:05,180
but there's another thing of like seeing
it in a text form is this is not the

354
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:06,114
same.

355
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,230
It looks at things don't,

356
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:08,430
don't look good in print.

357
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,293
Certain things.

358
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,250
And I think what happened was,

359
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,030
is in the middle of like when you have,

360
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,550
you have a contextual conversation,

361
00:11:14,551 --> 00:11:15,331
it's like you have people,

362
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:16,440
there's inflection,

363
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,020
there's another guy next to you going,

364
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,211
well,

365
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:18,391
hey,

366
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:19,111
what do you mean by that?

367
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:21,300
And then you're clarifying
it or it's just,

368
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:25,290
it's a different energy when you're
tweeting and you're that mad.

369
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,561
Like,

370
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,570
I think he like any type of an assault,

371
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:30,060
even if it's a woman hitting you
and it's not life threatening,

372
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,270
it's still like an hour later you're like,

373
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,620
what the fuck just happened?

374
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:37,020
Like I think it just freaked him
out and she hit him a couple times,

375
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:37,854
five times or so,

376
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,580
and he showed me pictures of his
face and he had like a little,

377
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,930
you could see that he had been struck
him and he wasn't making it up.

378
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,870
And so he went on and
when I looked at the,

379
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:46,131
the,

380
00:11:46,131 --> 00:11:46,921
the flow of things,

381
00:11:46,921 --> 00:11:49,350
like I know Anthony and
I know what he's saying.

382
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,120
He was not calling all
black people animals.

383
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:51,481
He wasn't,

384
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:52,530
because he's never said that.

385
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,940
He's talking about a
behavior of this woman.

386
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,880
And I think that what
happened was he was so mad.

387
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,250
And when you're tweeting that
aggressively and you've just,

388
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:03,670
you're fucking dealing with this in
your head that sometimes things come out

389
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,930
jumbled and muddied.

390
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:05,201
And like,

391
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:05,771
if you know aunt,

392
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:06,604
you know what he's saying?

393
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,361
People who don't know,

394
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:08,230
I'm reading this going,

395
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,071
what does he mean?

396
00:12:09,071 --> 00:12:11,800
He's saying that there's violence
in black people and their animals,

397
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:16,630
like people are putting these pieces of
a puzzle together and they're making a

398
00:12:16,631 --> 00:12:18,430
picture and it was like,

399
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,863
it just,

400
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,130
I know him well enough to know that
in a conversation if someone said,

401
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:25,510
are you trying to say
black people or animals,

402
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:25,750
he would go,

403
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,990
no,

404
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,351
not at all.

405
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:28,150
It's a bay behavioral based that,

406
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:28,810
you know what I mean?

407
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,730
Cause you said that
about white people too.

408
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,760
So I mean it was just one of those
things where once it was in print,

409
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,500
it's even in context,

410
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:39,220
we lie as a country like you know
like when cancel Colbert came out the,

411
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:42,940
the activist knew the context that he
was making those Asian jokes and didn't

412
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:43,630
give a fuck.

413
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,890
She still wanted to sink him.

414
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,311
She's like,

415
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:45,371
no,

416
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:45,521
no,

417
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:46,001
I get it.

418
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:46,481
He was trying to,

419
00:12:46,481 --> 00:12:46,870
you know,

420
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,780
showed the difference between the,

421
00:12:47,781 --> 00:12:47,990
the,

422
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,111
the,

423
00:12:48,111 --> 00:12:50,860
the same thing between this and native
Americans and how ridiculous says but I

424
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:51,694
don't care.

425
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,000
So we've gotten to a point now where we
don't even pretend to not understand the

426
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:55,870
context anymore.

427
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,720
We admit that we understand the
context that we go after people anyway.

428
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,380
So something like this is bound to,

429
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,220
uh,

430
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,540
to sink you because it can be taken both
ways unless you actually sit there and

431
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,660
talk to the guy and each tweet
has to come out like a film.

432
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,790
Each tweet has to be a beginning,

433
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,061
middle,

434
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:17,050
and end with no explanation
needed around it in order to,

435
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,150
to be survivable,

436
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,200
if that makes sense.

437
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:20,411
Well,

438
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:20,951
you know what,

439
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:21,784
the big,

440
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,970
big key to what you said
that it could sink you will,

441
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,980
it only syncs you if
you work for a company.

442
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,270
And in my opinion,

443
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,150
that's unnecessary in this day and age,

444
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:32,110
it's unnecessary.

445
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,210
And I think you guys,

446
00:13:34,211 --> 00:13:39,040
and I think Anthony for sure would
be far better off with a podcast.

447
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,470
Anybody can get a podcast
and put it on their phone.

448
00:13:41,471 --> 00:13:45,310
Now everybody's phone has a little Jack
that sticks in your car and you play

449
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:46,210
your phone through your car.

450
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,650
Everybody has that now.

451
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:47,921
I mean,

452
00:13:47,921 --> 00:13:49,360
it's not an uncommon thing.

453
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:53,140
It's more common to have that Jack
than it is to have satellite radio.

454
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,200
Most people have to get a satellite
radio thing installed in their car.

455
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,890
Most people already have that Jack,

456
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:58,750
you know,

457
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,320
it's just,

458
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,670
it's so God damn easy.

459
00:14:00,671 --> 00:14:01,150
And I get,

460
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,490
I bet you could get all the same sponsors.

461
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,420
I bet you could get all of
the same sponsors and you
would have no middleman and

462
00:14:07,421 --> 00:14:08,560
you don't look at the studio.

463
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:08,961
It's not,

464
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:10,780
it doesn't take much to
put something together.

465
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:11,321
You know,

466
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:12,101
a little bit of time,

467
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:12,970
a little bit of effort.

468
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:13,451
You know,

469
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:14,990
you gotta know someone who's an engineer,

470
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,800
know someone who knows how to put
this stuff together and set up the

471
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:18,371
microphones.

472
00:14:18,371 --> 00:14:19,210
But other than that,

473
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,820
what's the difference between
this and satellite radio?

474
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,571
I'll tell you what,

475
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:23,320
the differences,

476
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,640
nobody can fucking fire you.

477
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:30,130
You can go on some con rampage
that fucking animal con and no one,

478
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,371
you know,

479
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:31,121
people might say,

480
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,950
I'm not downloading your podcast anymore,

481
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,280
but at least you have the
opportunity to communicate,

482
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,450
to explain yourself.

483
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:41,710
And if the people decide that they don't
like your character based on one thing

484
00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:43,840
that you said or one
rant that you went on,

485
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,010
that is their decision.

486
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,900
But it's not the decision of a company.

487
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:50,290
And when things get Kino
companies are squirrely man,

488
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:55,291
they have fucking and stocks and they
have responsibilities and all you need is

489
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:59,630
a few activists that start
web pages and you know,

490
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:01,400
fire Anthony and Anthony can,

491
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,260
we were going after those sponsors,

492
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,010
we're going to let them know we're
boycotting but mostly just noise.

493
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,210
Mostly nonsense.

494
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,860
Mostly just soft targets.

495
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,480
But all you need is a few of those
in up a fucking accompany will panic.

496
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,240
They do.

497
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:15,861
What happens is,

498
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:16,101
you know,

499
00:15:16,101 --> 00:15:17,750
to $1 billion company,

500
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:21,380
so you get guys like you know
Scott and Jim who runs it,

501
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,401
who you know,

502
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:25,280
they're just the 4th of July weekend was
coming and then all of a sudden they're

503
00:15:25,281 --> 00:15:29,030
getting phone calls from the New
York Post and the Washington Post,

504
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,630
although all the press obviously has
a narrative and they did a shit job.

505
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,660
But the Washington Post I thought was
the worst offender with the way they

506
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:36,141
covered it.

507
00:15:36,141 --> 00:15:37,010
Cause the woman wrote things.

508
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:37,581
It was just really,

509
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:38,840
it was revolting to read,

510
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:39,883
which she right.

511
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,960
She was talking about Anthony saying
that these guys came around and she was

512
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:45,794
saying like,

513
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,041
oh,

514
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,750
well I guess if a bunch
of African American where,

515
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:48,081
how was she?

516
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:51,530
Said a bunch of gentlemen want to
defend that someone from defaming,

517
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:52,490
an African American woman.

518
00:15:52,491 --> 00:15:53,001
It's okay.

519
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:54,050
Like that's what was happening.

520
00:15:54,051 --> 00:15:55,910
She wasn't acknowledged
and Anthony was being hit.

521
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,520
She acted like that.

522
00:15:57,521 --> 00:15:59,590
These guys had read his
Twitter feed and not like it.

523
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,510
It was just like she read the
Twitter feed in them in the future.

524
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:03,590
It was repulsive about this.

525
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:03,741
Well,

526
00:16:03,741 --> 00:16:06,860
a woman who looks like the fucking fake
deaf interpreter from Mandela's funeral

527
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,570
was beating on Anthony,

528
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,123
but a

529
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:12,963
fucking,

530
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,090
that's a meme.

531
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,020
That guy's a meme.

532
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:15,883
He's rules.

533
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:16,281
But,

534
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:16,501
uh,

535
00:16:16,501 --> 00:16:18,110
the company that these guys just getting,

536
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:18,921
all of the sudden they're just there.

537
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:21,050
They're home and they're getting phone
calls in the office the day before

538
00:16:21,051 --> 00:16:21,680
vacation.

539
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,640
So what are your comments?

540
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,240
And they probably weren't even that
familiar with it until they getting calls

541
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,120
from the paper and they're like,

542
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,080
what do we do with this?

543
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,200
And then this is what the press does
and this is why you got to hate them

544
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:32,060
because I think Sirius was
going to try to write it out.

545
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:33,050
That's my opinion.

546
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,000
Cause they knew a holiday
weekend was coming.

547
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:35,841
And uh,

548
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:35,970
I,

549
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,080
this is purely a guess because
no one was saying anything.

550
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,120
And then all of a sudden
the press starts going,

551
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,370
we have not had a comment
from Sirius satellite radio.

552
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,980
So we're assuming that they agree
with Mr. Coleman has opinions.

553
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:50,690
They do this sneaky shit to push
you into defending yourself.

554
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,760
So now the company with shareholders,

555
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:53,101
like you said,

556
00:16:53,101 --> 00:16:53,481
it has to go,

557
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:53,601
well,

558
00:16:53,601 --> 00:16:55,430
how do we tell people
that we don't agree with?

559
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,510
So it's not like if the
press is the made them do it,

560
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:04,550
but the press understands how to
corner you into giving a statement,

561
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:05,660
a definitive statement,

562
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,310
cause they know that
you're not used to this.

563
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,290
They know that these guys come into work,

564
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:09,660
uh,

565
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,950
in management positions are not
used to getting phone calls going.

566
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:14,900
How do you feel about this
statement and that statement?

567
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:15,410
You know,

568
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,310
it was really,

569
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,720
it was a very frustrating thing when I
saw at the press did with it that that to

570
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:23,590
me is always who my biggest complaint
is with always it's wordpress.

571
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,540
This is no nuance to the way they
report on certain things like this cause

572
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:28,820
there's,

573
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,140
there's nuance to this,

574
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,060
especially if you look
into it and character.

575
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,740
If you in context rather if you
understand that guy and you,

576
00:17:35,741 --> 00:17:36,860
you look at him.

577
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,221
Look,

578
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:42,221
there is a problem with violence in the
black community to pretend there's not a

579
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:45,770
problem with violence in the black
community is to pretend that there aren't

580
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:50,830
insane amounts of murders going on in
Chicago to that there's not issues with

581
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,130
the amount of black
people that are in jail.

582
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:57,390
The percentage of the population
now are those economic problems,

583
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,970
are those problems related to upbringing?

584
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,960
Are those pro yes.

585
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:01,591
Education?

586
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:02,010
Yes,

587
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:02,760
absolutely.

588
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,930
There's a lot of fucking disparity.

589
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:05,490
There's a lot of problems with poverty.

590
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,090
There's a lot of problems
with the structure of our
culture itself and that you

591
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:11,280
could attribute a lot of
those problems to racism,

592
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,970
to racism in the way
that funds are allocated.

593
00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:15,940
The way that you know,

594
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,100
the attention that society puts
on impoverished communities.

595
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,300
Absolutely institutionalized,

596
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,780
yes.

597
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,800
But to pretend that it's
not a problem is ridiculous.

598
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,210
It's fucking ridiculous.

599
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,230
So when he's taking a picture of some
chick and she starts punching him,

600
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,370
I think he's allowed to talk
about the problem with violence,

601
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,780
with that community,

602
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,260
with the community that this person
is from that's beating him up.

603
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,610
Did he do it the right way?

604
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,563
No,

605
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,381
absolutely not.

606
00:18:43,381 --> 00:18:46,890
Did he do it in a way that
can be misconstrued or
construed or interpreted as

607
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:47,550
racist?

608
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,510
Absolutely did.

609
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:48,961
Yeah,

610
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,321
he did.

611
00:18:49,321 --> 00:18:50,130
He fucked up.

612
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,090
He did it the wrong way.

613
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,740
He probably shouldn't
have done it on Twitter.

614
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,000
You probably should have made a video.

615
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,250
You probably should have
made a video explaining,

616
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:00,330
showing what happened to him
and explaining what goes on.

617
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,800
Explaining this 140
fucking characters things.

618
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,840
He's a big part of the
problem it would add.

619
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:08,460
So that's exactly what it was.

620
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,730
Because Anthony is so good at clarify.

621
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,710
Whenever you talk about race
or a million other things,

622
00:19:13,711 --> 00:19:14,544
whether it's religion,

623
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:20,080
it's so hard to make your point without
stepping in shit and then having to go

624
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:22,860
off on 50 a digression.

625
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:23,061
I was like,

626
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:23,221
oh no,

627
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:23,941
that's not what I meant him.

628
00:19:23,941 --> 00:19:24,080
No,

629
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,601
that's not what I meant.

630
00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:24,760
Like,

631
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,020
and that's the worst part of discussing
stuff is that people jump on the side.

632
00:19:28,021 --> 00:19:29,640
What are you saying that all people do?

633
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:30,300
And we'll all black too.

634
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:30,661
No,

635
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:31,494
I'm not.

636
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,900
So in order to be able
to get your point across,

637
00:19:33,901 --> 00:19:35,130
you have to walk a narrow,

638
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,370
you almost have to close
people's argument doors,

639
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,260
like a get smart episode.

640
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:41,790
As you're walking this way,

641
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,230
your point gets through.

642
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,770
And Anthony is a genius at doing that.

643
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,340
A genius at it because we've
debated race so many times,

644
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,031
uh,

645
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:51,481
on,

646
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,200
on the show at him.

647
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,033
But trace,

648
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,550
we'd go back and forth and,

649
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,520
and Patrice loved Anthony
Cause he said Anthony,

650
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:57,630
he's an adorable racist.

651
00:19:57,631 --> 00:19:57,751
You know,

652
00:19:57,751 --> 00:19:58,760
Patrice was so funny with,

653
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,161
he never,

654
00:19:59,161 --> 00:19:59,580
no,

655
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,180
never was upset by Anthony's opinions
because Anthony would listen to him and

656
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:04,170
they would go back and forth.

657
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,440
Half The Times Patrice was right
and half the time Anthony was right.

658
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,210
But on Twitter I think like,

659
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:11,910
like in that emotion when you're saying x,

660
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:12,744
Y and Z,

661
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,230
he,

662
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:17,910
I don't think he did as good a job as he
should have done of closing those doors

663
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,841
behind him.

664
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:23,841
Almost like sealing off things that
people can get to you on because he was so

665
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:25,740
upset because he had
had a physical assault.

666
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,770
And I know it sounds like I'm talking
in circles and just defending my friend,

667
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:33,060
but I've been with him for 10 years
in this medium of totally uncensored.

668
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,530
And I'm telling you,

669
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:36,660
I know him well enough
to know that he's like,

670
00:20:36,661 --> 00:20:40,050
he's got weird things where he'll talk
about race and people misinterpret them

671
00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:43,350
and I've talked to him privately and
the guy does not hate black people and I

672
00:20:43,351 --> 00:20:45,450
know that that's just all
his friends defending him.

673
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,980
But I'm telling you that he does
not because I know him well.

674
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,360
And then to hear people going,

675
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:50,260
he hates black people.

676
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:55,261
It's like he's in this not afraid of
being misconstrued or interpreted as

677
00:20:55,931 --> 00:20:56,411
racist.

678
00:20:56,411 --> 00:21:00,640
He's not afraid of it by saying what
he really believes is his opinion about

679
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:02,470
certain aspects of a group,

680
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,370
whatever,

681
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:03,610
uh,

682
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,050
race,

683
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:04,240
uh,

684
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,661
gender,

685
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:05,494
whatever it is.

686
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:09,370
He's not afraid of speaking his mind about
things because he's got that fuck you

687
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:09,760
money.

688
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,600
That's a big part of it.

689
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:12,160
And he's got 150,000 guns.

690
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,203
Those are the two things.

691
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,170
And you know,

692
00:21:14,171 --> 00:21:18,580
a big part of it that drove me
fucking crazy is people are not,

693
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,760
they're not taking into account the
reaction that someone has when they get

694
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:22,540
assaulted.

695
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,010
Because when you get hit by someone,

696
00:21:24,011 --> 00:21:28,110
some fucking stranger that you don't know
hits you as specially when you've got

697
00:21:28,111 --> 00:21:29,290
a gone,

698
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:33,970
you've got a fucking bullet launching gun,

699
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,390
you've got a thing inside
you that has explosions,

700
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,830
you press a trigger,

701
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,300
explosions propelled bullets
and they end lives instantly.

702
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:47,290
And Anthony's an expert with one and
he has it on him at all times and he's

703
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,000
getting hit and he's like,

704
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,380
what the fuck?

705
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,440
And so he gets on left fucking animal con.

706
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,201
Yeah Bitch,

707
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:54,550
fuck you this back.

708
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,660
You know,

709
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,260
it's getting hit is a
very disturbing thing.

710
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,130
It's,

711
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:00,371
I mean,

712
00:22:00,371 --> 00:22:04,000
there's one thing to get hit and it's
like getting hit in a sparring session is

713
00:22:04,001 --> 00:22:05,410
infuriating with people.

714
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,580
And I've seen people go fucking crazy
cause they get choked out in a Jujitsu

715
00:22:09,581 --> 00:22:10,240
session,

716
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,530
getting punched his way,

717
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:12,364
more traumatic,

718
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,780
getting punched by a stranger multiple
times for taking a fucking photograph.

719
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,720
I don't know what the exchange
was between the two of them.

720
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,601
I don't know.

721
00:22:20,601 --> 00:22:20,980
You know,

722
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,380
if,

723
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,970
if he was saying something
that was infuriating,

724
00:22:24,971 --> 00:22:25,460
I don't know.

725
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:25,641
I've,

726
00:22:25,641 --> 00:22:26,474
I wasn't there,

727
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:26,681
you know,

728
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:27,700
I'm not gonna pretend I was there.

729
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:28,511
But man,

730
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:32,230
you've got to take into
account the reaction that
people have when you hit them.

731
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,401
And it would it to me,

732
00:22:33,401 --> 00:22:33,791
and again,

733
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,560
I hate to keep going back to the press,

734
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,800
but they didn't focus on the fact that he,

735
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:41,730
like he handled himself properly
in that because I know I would,

736
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,270
I don't know if I would have
pulled the gun in that moment,

737
00:22:43,271 --> 00:22:45,770
but I'm a panicky Pete
and I would just been,

738
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,990
what other guys were coming over,

739
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:48,190
I would have at least brandished it.

740
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,580
And he acted physically
responsible like as a,

741
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,030
as a,

742
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,800
as a fucking guy with a pistol on him.

743
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,880
Cause people get shot all the time
for dumb arguments and dumb things.

744
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:58,620
He,

745
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:03,620
he handled himself absolutely right and
lost his cool once he got home and uh,

746
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,350
people didn't take the press,

747
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:06,250
didn't take that into account.

748
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:08,350
They hopped on the fact that
he didn't get a police report.

749
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:09,591
And I wished he had.

750
00:23:09,591 --> 00:23:10,570
Now in hindsight,

751
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,650
because they're all going,

752
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:12,161
Mr Colby,

753
00:23:12,161 --> 00:23:13,030
did I get a police report?

754
00:23:13,031 --> 00:23:13,840
But here's the deal.

755
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,430
Had he gotten a police report,

756
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,480
they would have just ignored it.

757
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,920
They wouldn't have said,

758
00:23:17,921 --> 00:23:19,390
well at least he got a police report.

759
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,340
They would have glanced
over the fact and then said,

760
00:23:21,341 --> 00:23:21,521
yeah,

761
00:23:21,521 --> 00:23:22,660
well I ain't look and get a police report,

762
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,840
so they would just using that as a reason
to kind of ignore the fact that he got

763
00:23:25,841 --> 00:23:26,051
hit.

764
00:23:26,051 --> 00:23:26,261
They're like,

765
00:23:26,261 --> 00:23:26,311
oh,

766
00:23:26,311 --> 00:23:27,640
we didn't see a police report.

767
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:31,210
All the press harped on the fact
that he didn't get a police report,

768
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,620
but Ansi response was,

769
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:33,160
look man,

770
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,760
you know,

771
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,960
I know enough cops to know that me getting
hit by some lady in Times Square is

772
00:23:37,961 --> 00:23:41,020
not a fucking priority for Nyp d
who's worried about terrorists.

773
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:41,381
Yeah,

774
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:42,580
especially if he's fine.

775
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:46,040
I think there's a real
issue also with the press

776
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,480
with a lot of people in the press.

777
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,470
I'll clarify that.

778
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,880
What they're trying to do is they're
trying to close those get smart doors as

779
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:54,080
they write a piece as well,

780
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,460
and as they're writing a piece,

781
00:23:55,610 --> 00:24:00,590
they are also trying to placate all the
people that are going to be up in arms

782
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:01,580
about their opinions.

783
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,040
If they could possibly
be supporting a racist,

784
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,320
if they could possibly be taking his side,

785
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:07,310
agreeing with him,

786
00:24:07,311 --> 00:24:08,540
seeing his point of view,

787
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,250
they could be misinterpreted or they
could be interpreted as being racist as

788
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:13,760
well.

789
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,320
So they have to worry about that as well.

790
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,570
Especially if you're with a liberal rag,

791
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:17,991
you know,

792
00:24:17,991 --> 00:24:21,380
if you have a very liberal newspaper
that you work for and they have a clear

793
00:24:21,381 --> 00:24:21,831
agenda,

794
00:24:21,831 --> 00:24:22,700
which a lot of them do,

795
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:23,810
the Washington Times does,

796
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:24,110
right.

797
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:24,680
I'll wash it.

798
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,790
Absolute washing post does.

799
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,470
There's a lot of them that have a liberal
slant and if you are reporting for

800
00:24:30,471 --> 00:24:30,920
them,

801
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,251
you know,

802
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:34,790
and it's something like this that's
very controversial and something where

803
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:35,190
there's,

804
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,600
there's a bunch of things
that automatically have
like a knee jerk reaction to

805
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:38,990
them.

806
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:42,860
And this is one of them knee jerk
reaction to what's conceived as racist.

807
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:43,630
It perceived as racist.

808
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:43,991
Yes.

809
00:24:43,991 --> 00:24:44,240
And,

810
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,730
and another thing that
they do that's even,

811
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,760
that's even more enraging is what people
who write for the press now have to do

812
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,370
is not just reporting what happened.

813
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,660
It's how do I editorialize under
the guise of being impartial.

814
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,480
And they do that a lot too
and that I don't like either.

815
00:25:01,481 --> 00:25:03,490
It's like that to me is the
worst crime they commit.

816
00:25:03,491 --> 00:25:04,300
Actually.

817
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,960
It's the editorializing
as they're going along.

818
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,070
Like it's legitimate.

819
00:25:09,071 --> 00:25:09,371
Like,

820
00:25:09,371 --> 00:25:10,090
uh,

821
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:12,310
like NBC and I'm on a Zimmerman Fan.

822
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:13,450
Either aunt was a big supporter.

823
00:25:13,451 --> 00:25:13,961
Zimmerman,

824
00:25:13,961 --> 00:25:16,240
I thought Zimmerman should have
went to jail for something.

825
00:25:16,241 --> 00:25:18,430
I didn't know what legally I
have no ground to stand on,

826
00:25:18,431 --> 00:25:19,450
but I kind of thought he was a con,

827
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:23,320
but a but button on a guy who was
out to commit a murder or either,

828
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:24,640
I thought there was a line in between,

829
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:25,390
but whatever,

830
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,660
like NBC edited that tape like Eh,

831
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:29,570
can't do.

832
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,950
There's no reason to do that
unless you're pushing something.

833
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,980
But they're doing it under the guise
of being impartial and I'm sure they've

834
00:25:35,981 --> 00:25:37,660
done it plenty of times to vilify blacks.

835
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:38,500
I'm not saying they haven't,

836
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,550
he lost that lawsuit,

837
00:25:39,551 --> 00:25:40,100
you know?

838
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,320
I know he did crazy.

839
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,011
It's crazy.

840
00:25:42,011 --> 00:25:43,390
It's absolutely nuts.

841
00:25:43,391 --> 00:25:46,720
I don't know why the news has such a
different level of what they can get away

842
00:25:46,721 --> 00:25:49,570
with and what they can do because
they're seen as doing a public service.

843
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,381
In my opinion though,

844
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:53,100
I think they lost it because everybody
was hating that guy and they just want,

845
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,570
they didn't want him to win
something on top of this.

846
00:25:55,571 --> 00:25:57,090
The fact that he's still has his freedom,

847
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,040
the kid lost his life.

848
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,350
I think he's,

849
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,140
I think he's a sucky
fucking security guard.

850
00:26:02,141 --> 00:26:02,800
That's what I think.

851
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,040
Yeah.

852
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,850
I think if you're going to look at that
guy and find fault and what he did,

853
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,090
it's how did he handle the
situation and what a more confident,

854
00:26:10,091 --> 00:26:11,920
competent person have
handled it the same way.

855
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,630
Like here's a perfect example.

856
00:26:13,631 --> 00:26:15,610
My friend big John McCarthy who was a cop,

857
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,990
I guarantee you,

858
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:17,890
you know the referee.

859
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:18,801
Oh yeah,

860
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:18,931
yeah,

861
00:26:18,931 --> 00:26:19,764
yeah.

862
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,490
That guy was a cop a long time,

863
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,570
but great guy,

864
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,370
but knows how to handle shit.

865
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,940
If Big John McCarthy saw that
kid walking in the neighborhood,

866
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:28,841
he probably would have said,

867
00:26:28,841 --> 00:26:29,530
how you doing man?

868
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,363
Everything cool.

869
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:30,691
You know,

870
00:26:30,691 --> 00:26:32,020
it had a conversation with him.

871
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,370
Everything would've been fine.

872
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,000
Like even if the kid got up in
arms or got mouthy with them,

873
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,830
he would have probably calmed them down,

874
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,401
you know,

875
00:26:39,401 --> 00:26:41,740
without having to get into
some physical altercations.

876
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,840
Not only the kid wouldn't have been able
to mount them and bash his fucking head

877
00:26:45,841 --> 00:26:47,620
off the ground because he's
physically in competent.

878
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,160
If you're going to fucking
could patrol the neighborhood,

879
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,540
you can't do it just with a gun,

880
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:51,820
right.

881
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,410
Can't be,

882
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,700
you can't have the only,

883
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,830
the last resort is your only resort.

884
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,371
You keep,

885
00:26:56,371 --> 00:26:57,600
can't physically defend himself.

886
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,710
He's out of shape.

887
00:26:58,711 --> 00:27:02,820
He's soft and doughy and he's not
physically able to hold that guy off.

888
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:06,210
But yet he's put himself in this
position where he's like a security.

889
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,290
He's the force of,

890
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:07,501
of,

891
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:08,850
of the truth of the law.

892
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:09,930
You can't do that.

893
00:27:09,931 --> 00:27:10,051
You know,

894
00:27:10,051 --> 00:27:10,530
you're not,

895
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,330
you're not qualified for that job.

896
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,343
He's just not.

897
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,590
So when that kid's on top of him
bouncing his fucking head off the curb,

898
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:17,760
look,

899
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,500
I don't see any way out for him other
than using a weapon right when that kid is

900
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:23,430
beating the shit out of him.

901
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,680
But he should have never
gotten to that position.

902
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:26,490
He should've never,

903
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,050
it should've never escalated to that.

904
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:32,160
You're telling me the only way to people
can communicate like that is it comes

905
00:27:32,161 --> 00:27:32,994
into violence.

906
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,361
No,

907
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:33,800
it,

908
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,190
it's how do you deal with it?

909
00:27:35,191 --> 00:27:36,120
How do you communicate?

910
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,740
How did you address this person?

911
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,990
What did you say when
he talked back to you?

912
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,891
What did you say?

913
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:41,401
What was,

914
00:27:41,401 --> 00:27:42,810
what were the exchange of words?

915
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,351
You know,

916
00:27:43,351 --> 00:27:43,950
and those,

917
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,611
those things.

918
00:27:44,611 --> 00:27:45,930
There's a big difference between,

919
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,940
there's a video that we
played the other day.

920
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:48,950
Um,

921
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:49,650
was there some,

922
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:50,041
the,

923
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:50,370
uh,

924
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,300
do you even lift bro?

925
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,163
You ever see that guy?

926
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,670
The Russian guy?

927
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,533
Is He Russian?

928
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,510
There's even a worst one though.

929
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:57,631
I don't know.

930
00:27:57,631 --> 00:27:58,950
The Pakistani kids though,

931
00:27:58,951 --> 00:28:00,840
in New York where the Bronx,

932
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,160
the police chief in Bronx,

933
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:02,731
New York was like,

934
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:03,600
stop doing it.

935
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:04,860
You're going to get killed.

936
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:08,030
That like these two kids had just gone
to youtube and they go up to people and,

937
00:28:08,031 --> 00:28:09,540
and horrible neighborhoods and are like,

938
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,420
hey man,

939
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,830
you got a problem while he's holding a
calculator and he's just trying to be

940
00:28:13,831 --> 00:28:14,251
funny.

941
00:28:14,251 --> 00:28:17,550
But these guys are just bashing their
heads in and stuff and said the Bronx,

942
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,780
a chief police or something.

943
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:19,201
Like I said,

944
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:19,471
look,

945
00:28:19,471 --> 00:28:20,041
stop it.

946
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:20,351
But yeah,

947
00:28:20,351 --> 00:28:21,184
these videos,

948
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,220
my point is if you watch those videos,

949
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:24,881
the guy,

950
00:28:24,881 --> 00:28:25,421
he comes up to,

951
00:28:25,421 --> 00:28:27,430
people that look like
they work out and goes,

952
00:28:27,431 --> 00:28:28,211
do you even lift bro?

953
00:28:28,211 --> 00:28:29,044
Look how small you are.

954
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,660
And some people handle it.

955
00:28:31,661 --> 00:28:32,410
Great.

956
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,430
Some people go,

957
00:28:33,431 --> 00:28:33,731
you know,

958
00:28:33,731 --> 00:28:33,911
like,

959
00:28:33,911 --> 00:28:34,211
man,

960
00:28:34,211 --> 00:28:34,541
I don't even,

961
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:35,231
don't pull it up.

962
00:28:35,231 --> 00:28:36,064
We don't need to see it.

963
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,911
Some people go,

964
00:28:36,911 --> 00:28:37,241
yeah,

965
00:28:37,241 --> 00:28:38,380
I mean I don't even lift,

966
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:38,801
you know,

967
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:39,670
I guess I'm small.

968
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,050
And then they laugh and they walk away.

969
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,550
And some people like threatened them.

970
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,390
Like it,

971
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:47,100
it depends entirely on how to
people interact with each other.

972
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:47,410
Yeah.

973
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:51,910
And I think that's what we don't
know about the Anthony situation.

974
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,460
That's what we don't know
about the Zimmerman situation.

975
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:57,070
It's not just about what went down,

976
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,350
it's about how did it all play out,

977
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,180
how could it have been avoided?

978
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:04,450
There's little subtleties in language
like when Jonah Hill is apologizing

979
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,284
recently.

980
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:05,560
Um,

981
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:05,891
and he's,

982
00:29:05,891 --> 00:29:06,041
he,

983
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:07,190
and he's obviously not a homophobe.

984
00:29:07,191 --> 00:29:08,080
We just got mad and said,

985
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:08,771
suck my Dick Faggot.

986
00:29:08,771 --> 00:29:10,120
It was a stupid thing in a moment.

987
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,610
And he's at the tonight show and again,

988
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,230
he's just apologizing is I don't think
he never had to deal with something like

989
00:29:14,231 --> 00:29:14,740
this.

990
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,521
And he said something.

991
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:15,791
He goes,

992
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:15,961
man,

993
00:29:15,961 --> 00:29:17,050
the intent doesn't matter.

994
00:29:17,051 --> 00:29:17,801
It's the word,

995
00:29:17,801 --> 00:29:18,634
the words.

996
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,481
And it was like,

997
00:29:19,481 --> 00:29:19,780
again,

998
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,780
I know you're on the spot in that moment
and I'm not going to crucify the guy,

999
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,960
but I wish I was there so I could
just appear on the seat next to him.

1000
00:29:25,961 --> 00:29:26,920
Like in that woody Allen scene,

1001
00:29:26,921 --> 00:29:29,080
when the guy walks out to
correct the guy on line and go,

1002
00:29:29,081 --> 00:29:29,291
no,

1003
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:30,430
the intent is everything.

1004
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:34,180
Because if the words don't matter the
next time somebody said the fucking giants

1005
00:29:34,181 --> 00:29:35,020
killed the jets,

1006
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,550
well we'd better call the police.

1007
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,061
Oh,

1008
00:29:37,061 --> 00:29:37,870
that's right.

1009
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,591
It's the intent.

1010
00:29:38,591 --> 00:29:39,640
We understand every,

1011
00:29:39,641 --> 00:29:40,151
every,

1012
00:29:40,151 --> 00:29:44,230
every single interaction or
phrase has an intent behind it,

1013
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:44,740
which,

1014
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,250
which doesn't always come
through in the written word.

1015
00:29:47,251 --> 00:29:49,990
It's just that it's an inflection and
that's something that you and I had a

1016
00:29:49,991 --> 00:29:54,760
conversation about with the Tracy Morgan
situation with the people pretending

1017
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,190
that what he was saying
when he was on stage,

1018
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,560
you know that he was going to
stab a sign of his son was gay.

1019
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:03,670
Like his whole act is filled
with him saying ridiculous shit.

1020
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,200
This is not a statement.

1021
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,370
It's not an affidavit.

1022
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,450
He's making court.

1023
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:07,831
You're,

1024
00:30:07,831 --> 00:30:10,570
you're taking it out of context
because it's a soft target.

1025
00:30:10,571 --> 00:30:11,404
If you do that,

1026
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:11,861
yes,

1027
00:30:11,861 --> 00:30:13,450
I'm going to stab my son because he's gay.

1028
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,730
As a statement of fact or at the,

1029
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:19,210
at the end of a political rally
is a pretty awful thing to say,

1030
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,900
but if you've opened up with I'm going
to get you pregnant and I'm going to mold

1031
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:24,190
shit and make a hat out of it,

1032
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,680
it's kind of hard to take
any one statement and go,

1033
00:30:26,681 --> 00:30:27,940
well that's the serious one.

1034
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:28,871
But that's again,

1035
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:32,500
that's that purposely ignoring context
or even when you can't ignore it saying,

1036
00:30:32,501 --> 00:30:32,651
yeah,

1037
00:30:32,651 --> 00:30:34,690
we understand the context
and we don't fucking care.

1038
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,040
It's just soft targets.

1039
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:38,830
People find soft targets
and those targets,

1040
00:30:38,831 --> 00:30:39,160
look,

1041
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,470
if they're all ganging up on Anthony too.

1042
00:30:41,471 --> 00:30:42,220
That's the other thing.

1043
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,900
I'm not saying Boo Hoo Anthony,

1044
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,490
let's pay attention to
what's really going on.

1045
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:49,120
If you're writing an article out of the
blue for no reason about Jim Norton,

1046
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:49,631
you,

1047
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:50,464
you're the only guy,

1048
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,830
I think Jim Norton is a despicable
person and you write this article,

1049
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,680
you have the option to respond
to that and you can go,

1050
00:30:56,681 --> 00:30:56,861
well,

1051
00:30:56,861 --> 00:30:58,840
who are you mister reporter,

1052
00:30:58,841 --> 00:30:59,561
Dick Wad.

1053
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:00,700
Let's take a look at you.

1054
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,980
And then other people can
take a look at him too.

1055
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,960
But when everybody's piling on,

1056
00:31:04,961 --> 00:31:06,100
it's a free for all.

1057
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,670
It's a free ride and then
you're there flailing wildly.

1058
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,400
All the Louie Louie CK actually
raised a really good point about that.

1059
00:31:12,401 --> 00:31:13,240
When something has happened,

1060
00:31:13,241 --> 00:31:13,451
he goes,

1061
00:31:13,451 --> 00:31:13,631
you know,

1062
00:31:13,631 --> 00:31:14,381
you have to remember too,

1063
00:31:14,381 --> 00:31:15,610
everybody's not googling you.

1064
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,480
Like everyone is not googling Joe Rogan
or Jim Norton or Anthony Kumi at like,

1065
00:31:19,481 --> 00:31:20,530
so you're seeing,

1066
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:21,880
uh,

1067
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,880
every result of that yourself
and it appears overwhelming.

1068
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,530
But the reality is like people may be
reading news day or the post or the Gawker

1069
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,900
or vice or you know,

1070
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,751
whatever they're reading,

1071
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:36,100
but they're not reading every
single article on Anthony
Kumiai or on Jim Norton.

1072
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,270
So it,

1073
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:41,200
that's where the overwhelming thing is
sometimes misleading because people are

1074
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:42,670
all reading little snippets of it.

1075
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:43,980
But when you know,

1076
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,430
the company is getting calls from again,

1077
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:49,630
five or six different outlets to them
and feels overwhelming and like what the

1078
00:31:49,631 --> 00:31:51,940
fuck do we do with this
because this wasn't on the air.

1079
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,171
So I think that's what,

1080
00:31:53,171 --> 00:31:53,471
and again,

1081
00:31:53,471 --> 00:31:54,910
they haven't discussed this with me,

1082
00:31:54,911 --> 00:31:55,121
I'm,

1083
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,760
I'm purely speculating because to them,

1084
00:31:57,761 --> 00:31:58,511
if it was on the air,

1085
00:31:58,511 --> 00:31:59,261
I'm guessing they would have said,

1086
00:31:59,261 --> 00:32:00,430
well that's what he does on the air.

1087
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,750
But they're not looking at it like,

1088
00:32:01,751 --> 00:32:03,340
well he was reacting to being hit.

1089
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,450
I think they just were like,

1090
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,940
oh okay we got to fire him.

1091
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,270
Like I think that's why they,

1092
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:10,540
they kind of just reacted very quickly.

1093
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,770
I think they fucked themselves.

1094
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:12,581
I really do.

1095
00:32:12,581 --> 00:32:15,580
They fucked themselves cause they were
supposed to be the place where it was

1096
00:32:15,581 --> 00:32:16,414
free speech.

1097
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,800
This is the wild place.

1098
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,090
But we're the virus.

1099
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,100
There was the virus channel member.

1100
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,080
Now it's Sirius Xm talk.

1101
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,840
That's it is Sirius XM talk.

1102
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,930
We have to rename it but we don't
know what would they have to,

1103
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,490
they have to ask you fly input.

1104
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,580
I don't want my name on the show.

1105
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:30,941
Like I want,

1106
00:32:30,941 --> 00:32:31,751
I want to be on this show,

1107
00:32:31,751 --> 00:32:33,090
but I don't want to be ob and Jimmy.

1108
00:32:33,091 --> 00:32:36,160
I don't people to feel like I'm jumping
into Anthony's seat cause I'm not,

1109
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,060
um,

1110
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,290
if they call it opie show,

1111
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:39,740
I'm much more with that

1112
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,810
because that's what it
was before he met Anthony.

1113
00:32:41,811 --> 00:32:41,961
Cool.

1114
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:43,400
Me How it call we Ms. Anthony.

1115
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,061
Uh,

1116
00:32:44,061 --> 00:32:44,331
yeah,

1117
00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:45,170
that would be kind of a,

1118
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,580
or Tony will call Tony so they
don't know who we're talking about.

1119
00:32:47,581 --> 00:32:48,380
What to say.

1120
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,490
Bring where's Tony?

1121
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,420
And it'll be sneaky.

1122
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,120
But again,

1123
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,180
it is a horrible,

1124
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,980
and it's like people get
mad at me and opiate.

1125
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,180
It's like we don't,

1126
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,440
I tried to say like,

1127
00:32:57,441 --> 00:32:59,390
we didn't mad at you for what?

1128
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,200
Because the,

1129
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,410
the people think that we're like a bunch
of teenagers hanging out and like you

1130
00:33:03,411 --> 00:33:06,380
guys should walk in support and it's like,

1131
00:33:06,381 --> 00:33:07,214
first of all,

1132
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:11,600
you know dumb motherfuckers that
say that Anthony I've talked to,

1133
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,670
he wouldn't walk and he told me,

1134
00:33:13,671 --> 00:33:14,120
dude,

1135
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,620
you got to make your money like,

1136
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:16,610
and it's all a and B,

1137
00:33:16,611 --> 00:33:17,450
I'm under contract.

1138
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,010
I can't just walk.

1139
00:33:19,011 --> 00:33:20,600
I have three more months in the contract.

1140
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,850
And Ob tried to clear this up on the air.

1141
00:33:22,851 --> 00:33:23,900
Like if we just walk out,

1142
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,710
if they don't fire us and we just walk
and say a bunch of more subs leave cause

1143
00:33:27,711 --> 00:33:28,281
they realize like,

1144
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:28,461
wow,

1145
00:33:28,461 --> 00:33:29,540
the show really is gone,

1146
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,930
then all of a sudden serious wants
to take action on us for breach.

1147
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,400
It's a whole fucking illegal.

1148
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,260
People just don't get that part of it.

1149
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,270
And they think that we're fucking Anthony.

1150
00:33:38,271 --> 00:33:38,481
You know,

1151
00:33:38,481 --> 00:33:40,400
who doesn't think we're
fucking Anthony Anthony?

1152
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:41,620
He knows we're not fucking,

1153
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,160
only an idiot thinks
you're fucking Anthony,

1154
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:45,260
but there's always going to be
idiots with opinions out there.

1155
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,343
And I'm fine with that.

1156
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,450
When people say like,

1157
00:33:47,451 --> 00:33:47,721
Dude,

1158
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:48,531
I love you and Opie,

1159
00:33:48,531 --> 00:33:51,440
but I got to cancel because
I'm staying with Anthony.

1160
00:33:51,441 --> 00:33:54,980
I don't get mad at those people or people
like I'm going to keep serious and I'm

1161
00:33:54,981 --> 00:33:56,090
also going to listen to ant.

1162
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,333
I don't bog.

1163
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:00,680
I'm fine with that too because I get the
emotion like whatever they got to do to

1164
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:03,140
support and is cool with me,

1165
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,240
I want them to stay because my,

1166
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:06,320
in my ideal world,

1167
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,410
they listen to me an opie and then
they fucking listen to Anthony.

1168
00:34:09,411 --> 00:34:10,460
There's no competition.

1169
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,151
I'm not going to,

1170
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:12,680
we're not like here you
don't mention Anthony.

1171
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,450
You don't want to fucking shell comes out.

1172
00:34:14,451 --> 00:34:14,721
I'm going to,

1173
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:17,960
I'm going to tweet it because I want him
to succeed cause he's one of my closest

1174
00:34:17,961 --> 00:34:18,500
friends.

1175
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,520
It's going to succeed.

1176
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,571
It's going to,

1177
00:34:20,571 --> 00:34:21,041
if you,

1178
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:21,441
you know,

1179
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:22,274
just,

1180
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:23,730
he's an entertaining guy.

1181
00:34:23,731 --> 00:34:28,731
He's an interesting guy in the platform
of the Internet is so free and easy and

1182
00:34:28,801 --> 00:34:31,860
he's already got a full
professional set up at his house.

1183
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:32,160
Yeah.

1184
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,690
People don't know if you've never seen.

1185
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,850
One of the main reasons I started this
podcast is because of live from the

1186
00:34:38,851 --> 00:34:42,360
compound because he set up
fucking greenscreen in his house,

1187
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,950
a professional studio,

1188
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:49,100
and he was playing images behind him
of like the city of like he had a green

1189
00:34:49,591 --> 00:34:50,021
screen,

1190
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:55,021
I mean a beautiful green screen po like
professional broadcast quality cameras,

1191
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,100
like the whole deal.

1192
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:56,701
I was like,

1193
00:34:56,701 --> 00:34:57,750
that's amazing.

1194
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,350
And that slowly but surely led
to what you're seeing right here.

1195
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:06,590
Like him doing that while he was already
on Sirius and Sirius tried to stop him

1196
00:35:07,531 --> 00:35:08,364
from doing that.

1197
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:08,940
They got it.

1198
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,590
They gave him a hard time about that.

1199
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:11,150
Yeah,

1200
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:11,450
I mean,

1201
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:11,630
yeah,

1202
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,081
that was it.

1203
00:35:12,081 --> 00:35:14,150
I think that was a contractual
issue too where they're like,

1204
00:35:14,151 --> 00:35:14,361
look,

1205
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:15,410
this is the medium you're on.

1206
00:35:15,411 --> 00:35:16,041
But eventually they like,

1207
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:16,521
they're kind of like,

1208
00:35:16,521 --> 00:35:17,280
let them do it and they're like,

1209
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:17,780
uh,

1210
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,613
it's only,

1211
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,750
it would only help the show.

1212
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:20,501
It's just more,

1213
00:35:20,501 --> 00:35:21,670
more advertising,

1214
00:35:21,671 --> 00:35:23,230
more people paying attention,

1215
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,670
more entertainment,

1216
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,030
you know,

1217
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:27,370
it's going to get more people that,

1218
00:35:27,371 --> 00:35:27,511
I mean,

1219
00:35:27,511 --> 00:35:29,350
that's what people are
realizing about the Internet.

1220
00:35:29,351 --> 00:35:29,740
I mean,

1221
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,130
bars.

1222
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:35,110
Earlage got all upset at Metallica fans
for downloading his shit and it created

1223
00:35:35,111 --> 00:35:37,180
this huge shit storm.

1224
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,010
You know where everybody's

1225
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,191
like,

1226
00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:38,401
dude,

1227
00:35:38,401 --> 00:35:39,600
don't you have enough fucking money?

1228
00:35:39,601 --> 00:35:40,300
Like we,

1229
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,300
you're worried about people
downloading your shit.

1230
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,250
More people going to
come see you in concert.

1231
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,760
And that's what it really has turned
out to be for all musical artists.

1232
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:48,301
Yeah,

1233
00:35:48,301 --> 00:35:49,680
you're not selling as many records,

1234
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:53,340
but you're going to get more fans and
there's more people going to see you in

1235
00:35:53,341 --> 00:35:53,761
concert.

1236
00:35:53,761 --> 00:35:54,361
And guess what?

1237
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,090
That's all your money when you,

1238
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:00,120
when you can set that up and have people
just come out and see you in concert,

1239
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,380
that's actually better.

1240
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:02,640
I didn't mind.

1241
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,970
I'll tell you why I didn't mind large
doing that because I think that he kind of

1242
00:36:05,971 --> 00:36:06,690
say it.

1243
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:10,530
What was happening is with
the music industry was not
prepared for the onslaught

1244
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,520
of downloads.

1245
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,121
And again,

1246
00:36:12,121 --> 00:36:12,810
they're greedy.

1247
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,020
Twats the,

1248
00:36:14,021 --> 00:36:14,761
I mean the business,

1249
00:36:14,761 --> 00:36:15,541
not the artists,

1250
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:16,950
but the fucking guys behind the scenes.

1251
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,900
They've been raping artists for years.

1252
00:36:18,901 --> 00:36:19,950
Fucking taking all their money.

1253
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:24,540
But we had it not because I think iTunes
was born of the idea of Napster falling

1254
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:25,200
through.

1255
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:25,710
So it's like,

1256
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:29,820
I kinda like it because now I
can go buy a song or two songs.

1257
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,940
Like I'm not going to download a
whole fucking Nicki Minaj album,

1258
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:36,000
but there's one song you're like
fucking minutes looking ass Nigga is the

1259
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:38,100
fucking greatest song ever done.

1260
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:41,040
It's the fucking greatest thing ever done.

1261
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:42,360
I don't want to buy the whole album,

1262
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:45,740
but that fucking video
is ha is sexy railing.

1263
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,381
I dude,

1264
00:36:46,381 --> 00:36:47,700
I fucking love that song.

1265
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:48,511
I for real love it.

1266
00:36:48,511 --> 00:36:49,344
It's great.

1267
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,160
And that I would buy it.

1268
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,941
I don't want to buy the whole dumb.

1269
00:36:50,941 --> 00:36:51,900
I wish we could play it,

1270
00:36:51,901 --> 00:36:53,040
but we'll get pulled over you.

1271
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,600
It's a song you can't sing.

1272
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:57,210
Also with the windows down
to I found out recently,

1273
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,450
it's a lot of inwards.

1274
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:58,671
Yes,

1275
00:36:58,671 --> 00:36:59,504
it really is.

1276
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:00,551
But the eye,

1277
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:04,740
the lying she uses in
that a fucking great.

1278
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,980
And I love the song.

1279
00:37:05,981 --> 00:37:07,240
So that's just an example.

1280
00:37:07,241 --> 00:37:11,580
Like I can't buy that whole album and I
like it for my own dumb little cds that

1281
00:37:11,581 --> 00:37:12,271
are on iTunes.

1282
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:15,960
I liked the fact that can make some money
there and they're not just going to,

1283
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,700
people are still going to steal them pie.

1284
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:17,841
You know,

1285
00:37:17,841 --> 00:37:19,320
this is still brilliant people out there,

1286
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,160
but the majority of people
aren't computer geniuses.

1287
00:37:23,161 --> 00:37:23,550
They just,

1288
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:26,190
oh I'll go to iTunes for a buck and
buy a couple of trends like that.

1289
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,320
Kind of like if it's easy to do,

1290
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,550
people are going to pay for it.

1291
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,890
It's easy to one click on Amazon.

1292
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,110
People who pay for one click on iTunes.

1293
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:34,770
Yes,

1294
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:35,161
that's,

1295
00:37:35,161 --> 00:37:35,550
you know,

1296
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,270
that's,

1297
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,680
that's the way to do it.

1298
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,270
Make it so it's convenient.

1299
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:39,781
Make it,

1300
00:37:39,781 --> 00:37:43,200
I mean I think eventually you're going
well you're always going to have people

1301
00:37:43,201 --> 00:37:44,580
that have digital copies of things,

1302
00:37:44,581 --> 00:37:45,430
online stuff.

1303
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,830
It's always going to be the case,

1304
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:50,180
but people are getting more
and more hesitant to do
that because a lot of people

1305
00:37:50,181 --> 00:37:51,060
are getting fucked.

1306
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,810
Like people that are downloading illegal
parting of the UFC as they're getting

1307
00:37:54,811 --> 00:37:55,644
sued.

1308
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,290
People that have downloaded
movies are getting sued.

1309
00:37:58,291 --> 00:37:59,670
People that upload movies,

1310
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:02,670
like a lot of those guys that had like
a bunch of movies that they were sharing

1311
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:03,504
on bit torrent,

1312
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:06,210
they're getting sued
for fuckloads of money,

1313
00:38:06,211 --> 00:38:06,570
man.

1314
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:06,710
And,

1315
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,170
and,

1316
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:07,651
and people are like,

1317
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:09,210
why are they going after the little guy?

1318
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,073
Here's why.

1319
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,730
Because when the little
guy starts to have to,

1320
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:12,271
people say,

1321
00:38:12,271 --> 00:38:12,871
you can get sued,

1322
00:38:12,871 --> 00:38:13,031
I,

1323
00:38:13,031 --> 00:38:13,864
they can't win.

1324
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:14,341
Oh,

1325
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:14,521
okay.

1326
00:38:14,521 --> 00:38:15,271
That's how it happens.

1327
00:38:15,271 --> 00:38:16,230
You walk into court and go,

1328
00:38:16,231 --> 00:38:16,740
your honor,

1329
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,401
they can't win.

1330
00:38:17,401 --> 00:38:17,731
And he goes,

1331
00:38:17,731 --> 00:38:18,360
you're right.

1332
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,193
No charge.

1333
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:19,621
No,

1334
00:38:19,621 --> 00:38:21,120
you've got to pay for a fucking lawyer.

1335
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,310
And a lawyer is a 20 grand hit minimum.

1336
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,660
So the average person,

1337
00:38:24,661 --> 00:38:26,970
when they have to get an attorney and
they realize this is going to cost me

1338
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:27,870
10,000,

1339
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:30,780
$20,000 just to defend,

1340
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,310
they don't want to deal with it.

1341
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:32,851
So a lot,

1342
00:38:32,851 --> 00:38:34,680
that's a lot of times that's what
these little lawsuits are about.

1343
00:38:34,681 --> 00:38:35,980
It's getting just to back

1344
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,970
off and discouraging.

1345
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,121
Well,

1346
00:38:37,121 --> 00:38:40,300
I got errors and omissions insurance
because of a conversation I have with you.

1347
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,890
You told me about it.

1348
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:42,370
Yeah.

1349
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,200
And when you were getting sued,

1350
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,063
yes.

1351
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:45,701
It's,

1352
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:46,300
um,

1353
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:50,470
it's a very frustrating process because
you realize the legal process is not

1354
00:38:50,471 --> 00:38:51,640
free even if it,

1355
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:53,260
even if you think you're in the right,

1356
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,170
but in a way it's saved me
I think in the long run,

1357
00:38:56,171 --> 00:38:58,930
that experience because now
I have it for everything.

1358
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,250
I do my books,

1359
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,241
DVDs,

1360
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:01,720
cds,

1361
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:06,010
I get everything vetted and I have
like $3 million worth of insurance,

1362
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:08,380
which is probably a panicky
overkill on my part.

1363
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:13,080
But I do that because you want
to protect yourself even from a,

1364
00:39:13,081 --> 00:39:13,880
uh,

1365
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,140
uh,

1366
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:14,973
what's the word?

1367
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,593
Not Frugal,

1368
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,340
frivolous litigation.

1369
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,930
I don't know who's going to come after me.

1370
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,020
Somebody may hear something and then it
may cause him to bang their fucking head

1371
00:39:23,021 --> 00:39:24,310
into the wall and then say,

1372
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:26,770
I caused an autistic reaction
or I caused the fucking,

1373
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:27,600
I was the one,

1374
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,380
I was the one Al Roker made fun of the,

1375
00:39:29,381 --> 00:39:30,130
uh,

1376
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:30,970
uh,

1377
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:31,750
you know the liver.

1378
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:32,021
Yeah,

1379
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:32,171
no,

1380
00:39:32,171 --> 00:39:36,610
the Olympic logo is causing some
kind of a epileptic epileptics,

1381
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,713
whatever it is,

1382
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,630
someone can always file the suit
and you have to pay to defend it.

1383
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:41,530
So that type of shit.

1384
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,670
It's nice to have,

1385
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,031
you know,

1386
00:39:43,031 --> 00:39:44,260
that really does happen.

1387
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:44,920
Yes.

1388
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,600
There was a dude that I had on my podcast.

1389
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:47,710
His wife was an epileptic,

1390
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,580
not on my podcasts,

1391
00:39:48,581 --> 00:39:49,540
on my message board.

1392
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,140
His wife was an epileptic and uh,

1393
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:56,050
someone who had a logo that was like
flashing and he started complaining about

1394
00:39:56,051 --> 00:39:56,111
it,

1395
00:39:56,111 --> 00:39:57,190
you guys need to take that down.

1396
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,410
So then everybody put up a flashing logo.

1397
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,990
It was of course,

1398
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,370
but then he messaged me,

1399
00:40:03,371 --> 00:40:03,671
he's like,

1400
00:40:03,671 --> 00:40:04,504
seriously,

1401
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,800
my wife sees that she'll faint,

1402
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,100
so just go into a seizure.

1403
00:40:07,101 --> 00:40:07,451
And I was like,

1404
00:40:07,451 --> 00:40:08,284
come on.

1405
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,670
So I had to look it up.

1406
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:10,151
I was like,

1407
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:10,391
yeah,

1408
00:40:10,391 --> 00:40:10,871
it does.

1409
00:40:10,871 --> 00:40:11,230
There's,

1410
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:14,800
there was a certain television
show that was going on in Japan.

1411
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,000
It was like a kid's show.

1412
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:19,900
It's the one with the mighty
are the four guys power rangers?

1413
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,070
Was it the power rangers?

1414
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,480
Whatever it was.

1415
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:26,660
This television show made kids
have seizures for whatever reason.

1416
00:40:26,661 --> 00:40:29,500
Certain kids that have a certain issue,

1417
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:33,340
they would watch these flashing
things and just video games.

1418
00:40:33,341 --> 00:40:34,510
Now have that at the beginning.

1419
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:37,470
Like if you played a video game
like this game kid cost Caesar's,

1420
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,270
if you have that,

1421
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:42,180
if they used to have to warn you so and
so you've been pre worn fucking weird by

1422
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:42,340
the,

1423
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,450
everything that we deal with,

1424
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,293
it's annoying.

1425
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,280
Everything is because of lawsuits.

1426
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,210
So we kind of brought
it on ourselves to like,

1427
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:49,931
people are like,

1428
00:40:49,931 --> 00:40:50,591
why do they have to,

1429
00:40:50,591 --> 00:40:52,750
companies have to be so
like I'll get annoyed.

1430
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:54,520
It's serious sometimes like what the fuck?

1431
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:55,421
And then I'm like,

1432
00:40:55,421 --> 00:40:56,254
oh yeah,

1433
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,550
they have a shitload of people working
for them and every one of them has access

1434
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,440
to human resources and any one of those
people could just go to human resources

1435
00:41:05,441 --> 00:41:08,410
and say this is a hostile work
environment because of something,

1436
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,410
you know these people like why can't
we look at a girl's ass in the hallway?

1437
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,161
Go ahead,

1438
00:41:12,161 --> 00:41:12,731
pinch your ass.

1439
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:15,760
It gets 1950 and then
when they sue the company,

1440
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,230
the company's like,

1441
00:41:17,231 --> 00:41:17,890
what?

1442
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,720
Like what the fuck we going
to pay to defend this?

1443
00:41:19,721 --> 00:41:21,430
Because you couldn't
keep your hands off her.

1444
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:23,800
So as much as companies can drive me nuts.

1445
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:28,210
Sometimes all of these protective barriers
that have been put in place had been

1446
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,150
because citizens have filed lawsuits,

1447
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,950
some that were very legitimate,

1448
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,100
like sexual harassment guys

1449
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,390
have kind of pieces of shit with that.

1450
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,090
I,

1451
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:37,820
that was probably a bad
example because most guys,

1452
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:38,654
you know,

1453
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:41,570
women have told me horror stories where
they've got to deal with at work where

1454
00:41:41,571 --> 00:41:42,404
it's,

1455
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:42,890
yeah,

1456
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,060
it's more than just a glance,

1457
00:41:44,061 --> 00:41:44,631
like it's,

1458
00:41:44,631 --> 00:41:44,841
you know,

1459
00:41:44,841 --> 00:41:46,790
a guy rubbing his dick or while
they're getting coffee and going,

1460
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:46,951
Nah,

1461
00:41:46,951 --> 00:41:47,511
I'm kidding.

1462
00:41:47,511 --> 00:41:47,990
You know,

1463
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,171
it's like,

1464
00:41:48,171 --> 00:41:49,670
how do you fucking deal
with that if you're,

1465
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:50,391
but you know,

1466
00:41:50,391 --> 00:41:51,440
the companies have to deal with this.

1467
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:54,290
So then they put all this shit in
place to protect themselves from these

1468
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:56,930
litigious fucking shithead employees.

1469
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,231
Yeah,

1470
00:41:57,231 --> 00:41:57,861
there's both,

1471
00:41:57,861 --> 00:41:58,131
right.

1472
00:41:58,131 --> 00:42:00,830
There's real scenarios where people
are getting sexually harassed.

1473
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,690
Uber fucked up.

1474
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:03,141
You know,

1475
00:42:03,141 --> 00:42:05,780
could you imagine being a chicken and
office and some guy you don't want to have

1476
00:42:05,781 --> 00:42:10,130
anything to do with consistently hits on
you and tell dirty jokes and fucks with

1477
00:42:10,131 --> 00:42:12,140
you and asks you if you're gaining weight.

1478
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,320
If you ignore them and say,

1479
00:42:13,321 --> 00:42:13,670
hey,

1480
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,000
you know,

1481
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,080
they started getting weird.

1482
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:16,580
Guys are gross.

1483
00:42:16,581 --> 00:42:17,180
Creepy.

1484
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,070
I'm so glad I'm not a check.

1485
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:23,750
I couldn't imagine being a heterosexual
woman having to deal with men who want

1486
00:42:23,751 --> 00:42:24,500
to fuck me,

1487
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,520
or just the energy,

1488
00:42:25,521 --> 00:42:27,440
like the things that you
can't prove in court,

1489
00:42:27,441 --> 00:42:29,720
but the energy of the guy
who wants to fuck you,

1490
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:32,950
dumb dick up against the
fucking top of your desk.

1491
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:34,310
Are you doing well?

1492
00:42:34,311 --> 00:42:35,390
I'm just saying hello.

1493
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,820
You know you posted on what's the,

1494
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,521
he's resting it.

1495
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:37,900
Yeah,

1496
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:38,200
it's called.

1497
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:43,200
It's all mushed up fucking plump kids
fucking making men and women work together

1498
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:46,910
for eight hours in a row together in a,

1499
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,590
in a closed in environment.

1500
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:51,560
It's the automatic sexual
tension between some folks.

1501
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:52,280
It has to be,

1502
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:52,760
yeah,

1503
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,530
just there's no way around that man.

1504
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,310
Now from a,

1505
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,210
from a guy's point of view,

1506
00:42:56,211 --> 00:42:59,120
at least I think women are better because
their whole thing is picking which

1507
00:42:59,121 --> 00:43:00,140
guys they want to fucking pee.

1508
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:02,120
I think women are better
at going out of this.

1509
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,760
[inaudible] was professional
and not to do that.

1510
00:43:04,761 --> 00:43:05,750
We're just awful lot of,

1511
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:06,680
I know I'm awful at it,

1512
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,400
but it's also like there's just a,

1513
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:10,850
that's the social
environment of the office.

1514
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,440
There's always going to be weirdness.

1515
00:43:12,441 --> 00:43:12,661
Sure.

1516
00:43:12,661 --> 00:43:16,340
You know in the office and then if you
have those fucking office parties where

1517
00:43:16,341 --> 00:43:20,310
people get a little liquored up and
it all comes out that tonight he start

1518
00:43:20,311 --> 00:43:24,380
dancing and shit and little nuttiness and
next thing you know people are getting

1519
00:43:24,381 --> 00:43:25,280
fucking sued.

1520
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:25,641
Yeah.

1521
00:43:25,641 --> 00:43:27,990
You're dropping someone off and you want
to have jerking off in front of her in

1522
00:43:27,991 --> 00:43:29,840
the car and she goes in and feels dirty.

1523
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:33,650
Cause that happened for
whatever big deal over here.

1524
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,010
The frog worked together
for six months already.

1525
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,610
Fucking holiday parties.

1526
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:42,270
Yeah,

1527
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:43,460
I cleaned the dash.

1528
00:43:43,461 --> 00:43:43,731
Yeah,

1529
00:43:43,731 --> 00:43:44,564
come on,

1530
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,000
touch you on it.

1531
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:47,570
It,

1532
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:47,930
but that's,

1533
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:48,100
look,

1534
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,160
we have female interns.

1535
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:51,320
That's what keeps me from
hitting on the Internet.

1536
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,120
I'm fucking as Florentine,

1537
00:43:53,121 --> 00:43:55,460
which that Pete professional
with the interns.

1538
00:43:55,461 --> 00:43:56,294
I don't fucking,

1539
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:57,710
I'll joke with them on the air.

1540
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:59,950
I don't fucking look at
their asses in the hallway.

1541
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,360
I don't flirt with them because a,

1542
00:44:02,361 --> 00:44:06,890
the most of our 21 and 22 I don't want
one of them misinterpreting something and

1543
00:44:06,891 --> 00:44:08,420
going to human resources and going,

1544
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:12,320
this 45 year old piece of garbage is
hitting on me and then I'm going to sue

1545
00:44:12,321 --> 00:44:13,020
you.

1546
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:13,761
And then the company is like,

1547
00:44:13,761 --> 00:44:14,890
we're going to get sued at what the fuck?

1548
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:16,730
Because companies have lost
a lot of money with that.

1549
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,210
Oh yeah.

1550
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:19,340
They've lost in legit cases,

1551
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,870
but they don't want to take a chance.

1552
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,420
So then they're going to fucking look
at me and go one more time and you fall,

1553
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:23,601
you know,

1554
00:44:23,601 --> 00:44:23,961
whatever.

1555
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,040
So that's why I don't do it.

1556
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:29,830
Another aspect of this crazy litigious
society that we live in is patent trolls.

1557
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,280
That's the thing that Adam
going through right now.

1558
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:35,820
When we're all a part of it and we're
trying to help him raise money for his

1559
00:44:35,821 --> 00:44:36,654
legal funds,

1560
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,150
it's going to cost him $1 million.

1561
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:42,830
$1 million to defend
against this patent troll.

1562
00:44:42,831 --> 00:44:43,290
Yeah.

1563
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:44,220
And they,

1564
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:48,300
they already had a hearing and during
the hearing or they had whatever it is,

1565
00:44:48,301 --> 00:44:52,180
when they meet down and they discuss
the merits of the case and the,

1566
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:52,680
you know,

1567
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,900
the cases essentially
thought to be frivolous,

1568
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,850
but they're still going
forward with motion to dismiss.

1569
00:44:56,851 --> 00:44:58,890
That's why I tried to motion
to dismiss and they said no.

1570
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,060
So either,

1571
00:45:00,061 --> 00:45:04,470
I guess what they will do is go for my
guests will be the next step or they can

1572
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:05,880
go for summary Judgment,

1573
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:06,390
uh,

1574
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:07,740
maybe with a process,

1575
00:45:07,741 --> 00:45:09,060
all the facts and they say,

1576
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:09,511
you know,

1577
00:45:09,511 --> 00:45:11,160
should we go into depositions or whatever.

1578
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:11,490
And again,

1579
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:12,990
it might be different
in this kind of case,

1580
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:14,161
but uh,

1581
00:45:14,161 --> 00:45:15,460
there's a lot of that's a,

1582
00:45:15,461 --> 00:45:19,050
that's a patent troll friendly
area where they're from,

1583
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:22,590
which is why I think that a lot of these
people set up offices and that part of

1584
00:45:22,591 --> 00:45:23,220
Texas,

1585
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,430
but fucking the supreme
court just shot down.

1586
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:29,100
They really hurt patent trolls saying
something that you can't patent idea.

1587
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:33,180
Like you can patent a method of delivering
an idea when you can't patent the

1588
00:45:33,181 --> 00:45:35,330
idea of just like episodic
things on the internet or,

1589
00:45:35,331 --> 00:45:37,420
or whatever it was that
they said you can't do it.

1590
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:37,920
What's,

1591
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,330
let's give them a shout out here.

1592
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:40,830
Cause my God has sent me this.

1593
00:45:40,831 --> 00:45:41,130
Uh,

1594
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:43,500
he's the guy who runs
a Adam show over there.

1595
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:45,870
He sent me this thing about it
and give you the whole though.

1596
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:46,890
There's the full deal.

1597
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:51,950
So far they have raised
$425,000 for their,

1598
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:53,940
um,

1599
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,260
for their defense,

1600
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,970
their most recent bill.

1601
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:58,470
This is incredible.

1602
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:02,100
They have been running
at $100,000 a month,

1603
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,010
$100,000 a month for the last
three months in legal bills.

1604
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,460
So they're now at a deficit of $20,000.

1605
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:12,900
Personal audio has shown no signs of
backing down from their litigation posture

1606
00:46:12,901 --> 00:46:17,160
despite a discovery process that has
revealed the completely weak connection to

1607
00:46:17,161 --> 00:46:22,161
be drawn between their PR purported patent
apparatus and dissemination of media

1608
00:46:22,471 --> 00:46:24,390
files that we do as podcasts are.

1609
00:46:24,391 --> 00:46:28,170
So what they're hoping for is that
Adam somehow or another taps out.

1610
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:29,123
And if he does,

1611
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:31,860
then they try to hit
everybody who podcast with,

1612
00:46:31,861 --> 00:46:32,041
you know,

1613
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:32,221
hey,

1614
00:46:32,221 --> 00:46:34,020
give us 20 bucks a month
or whatever the fuck it is.

1615
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,393
Um,

1616
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:38,880
so they're going to have
to raise another 50,

1617
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:43,620
oh 500,000 to $750,000 to
continue with the litigation.

1618
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:44,581
Unbelievable.

1619
00:46:44,581 --> 00:46:45,181
It's incredible.

1620
00:46:45,181 --> 00:46:45,961
It's sickening.

1621
00:46:45,961 --> 00:46:47,190
And the only thing is,

1622
00:46:47,191 --> 00:46:47,340
and,

1623
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,140
and I don't know what it's like in Texas.

1624
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:51,030
I know in New York it's hard to get,

1625
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,350
but everyone thinks like,

1626
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:52,471
well,

1627
00:46:52,471 --> 00:46:52,861
hey man,

1628
00:46:52,861 --> 00:46:55,980
I'll just try to get them to
make them pay for my legal fees.

1629
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:57,720
That doesn't always happen.

1630
00:46:57,721 --> 00:46:57,831
And,

1631
00:46:57,831 --> 00:46:58,001
and,

1632
00:46:58,001 --> 00:46:58,141
and,

1633
00:46:58,141 --> 00:46:58,711
and it's a,

1634
00:46:58,711 --> 00:47:00,510
judges don't like to do that.

1635
00:47:00,511 --> 00:47:01,770
They don't like to give a,

1636
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:04,200
I forget what it's called,

1637
00:47:04,201 --> 00:47:05,280
but it's when you make the,

1638
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:05,670
uh,

1639
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:09,180
the suing attorney with
is suing the plaintiff,

1640
00:47:09,181 --> 00:47:10,950
pay the defendant's legal fees.

1641
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,430
It has to be proven to
be such a litigious I,

1642
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,040
uh,

1643
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,000
a frivolous thing.

1644
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:16,950
So that's a really hard thing to do.

1645
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:17,731
Yeah.

1646
00:47:17,731 --> 00:47:18,960
And if you want to help,

1647
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:21,120
this is the way they've
got it set up to help.

1648
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:21,810
Um,

1649
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:23,070
they have a,

1650
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:23,460
uh,

1651
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,740
podcast legal defense fund,

1652
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:26,820
Amazon account.

1653
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,140
And what that is,

1654
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:30,010
is if buy something

1655
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:30,820
from Amazon,

1656
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:32,290
if you do it through that account,

1657
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:33,310
they get a kickback.

1658
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,480
They get a piece of the action.

1659
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,700
So it doesn't cost you
anything as a person.

1660
00:47:36,701 --> 00:47:38,650
So if you use Amazon a lot,

1661
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:39,670
like I do,

1662
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:40,690
I love to use Amazon.

1663
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:41,650
If you use it,

1664
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,510
please use it through the podcast,

1665
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:44,770
legal defense,

1666
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,880
Amazon Fund.

1667
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:47,080
If you just Google that,

1668
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:49,750
it's on fund anything.com you can,

1669
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:50,170
um,

1670
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:51,220
you can find the,

1671
00:47:51,221 --> 00:47:51,840
uh,

1672
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,070
the,

1673
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:57,070
the link to it and Adam has a video up
there that explains what's going on and

1674
00:47:57,281 --> 00:47:58,600
how this all got started.

1675
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:00,130
It's really gross.

1676
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:00,440
It's,

1677
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:00,880
it's,

1678
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,910
and if you look at what the
actual patented is itself,

1679
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:04,151
it's,

1680
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:05,950
it's crazy that they can sue for it.

1681
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,860
It's essentially releasing
things in a serialized form,

1682
00:48:08,861 --> 00:48:09,760
like a form one,

1683
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:09,941
two,

1684
00:48:09,941 --> 00:48:10,181
three,

1685
00:48:10,181 --> 00:48:11,320
and four on the Internet.

1686
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:11,501
I mean,

1687
00:48:11,501 --> 00:48:12,334
that's a list.

1688
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:12,611
Yeah.

1689
00:48:12,611 --> 00:48:13,444
I mean that's like,

1690
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:14,680
that's crazy.

1691
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:18,310
Like the idea that you could patent
that it's just fucking bananas.

1692
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:18,641
Yeah,

1693
00:48:18,641 --> 00:48:18,780
it's,

1694
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:19,421
and it's very,

1695
00:48:19,421 --> 00:48:21,280
I forget what it's called
and they give them money.

1696
00:48:21,281 --> 00:48:22,120
It's really rare.

1697
00:48:22,121 --> 00:48:22,380
And they,

1698
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:22,960
in London,

1699
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,430
in England,

1700
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:23,921
in London,

1701
00:48:23,921 --> 00:48:24,401
and fucking,

1702
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,090
uh,

1703
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:25,451
England,

1704
00:48:25,451 --> 00:48:26,560
I think they're much more likely to,

1705
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:28,710
cause a lot of people are less
likely to sue for something that's,

1706
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:29,950
that they might be frivolous,

1707
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:31,270
although they may not get it,

1708
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:34,390
you may not be able to
recover on a frivolous lawsuit
because there may be legal

1709
00:48:34,391 --> 00:48:35,350
merits to this lawsuit.

1710
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:36,730
Even if even if they lose,

1711
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,560
what are the personal
audio they're called?

1712
00:48:38,561 --> 00:48:39,250
They may,

1713
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,840
it may not be a frivolous suit,

1714
00:48:40,841 --> 00:48:42,520
like in the legal system's eyes,

1715
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:46,030
the legal system may see this as a legit
suit that they win or lose as opposed

1716
00:48:46,031 --> 00:48:48,910
to a frivolous once Adam May not
be able to get his money back,

1717
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:49,840
even if he wins.

1718
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:50,600
Do you know what I mean?

1719
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,670
I totally hear you.

1720
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:52,870
So even if he wins,

1721
00:48:52,871 --> 00:48:55,330
he might still be hit
with all these legal fees.

1722
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:55,601
Sure.

1723
00:48:55,601 --> 00:48:58,240
And of course whoever loses
it can't be over of course,

1724
00:48:58,510 --> 00:48:59,051
unless pat.

1725
00:48:59,051 --> 00:48:59,471
Cause you know,

1726
00:48:59,471 --> 00:49:01,720
I'm guessing that the other place
has more money than Adam does.

1727
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:06,900
So an appeal will cost money and
everyone who podcasts has a very,

1728
00:49:06,971 --> 00:49:10,380
very vested interest in this because
I don't think it's a good lawsuit.

1729
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:13,660
I mean I don't think that their
right to ask for this at all.

1730
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:15,460
I think it's bullshit of course.

1731
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,170
And um,

1732
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:18,520
these guys have already made a
shit load of money suing apple.

1733
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,001
They,

1734
00:49:19,001 --> 00:49:19,141
uh,

1735
00:49:19,141 --> 00:49:19,450
the,

1736
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:19,810
they,

1737
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:21,400
I think they made seven or 8 million,

1738
00:49:21,401 --> 00:49:22,970
8 million I think on the
playlist or something.

1739
00:49:22,971 --> 00:49:24,080
And they were saying
about a playlist hump.

1740
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,250
Fucking crazy like that.

1741
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:26,050
I have to piss badly.

1742
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:26,883
Can I run in there?

1743
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:28,143
Don't worry about it man.

1744
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:28,810
So,

1745
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:29,170
um,

1746
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:34,170

got comes with a bunch of stuff.

1766
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,120
So they want to like help
out by using a package.

1767
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:02,861
That's awesome.

00:50:02,861 --> 00:50:03,310
Yeah.

1769
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:03,611
Yeah.

1770
00:50:03,611 --> 00:50:06,400
And Adam's a good guy and
I'm glad he's doing this.

1771
00:50:06,401 --> 00:50:08,470
I'm glad he's not buckling and just,

1772
00:50:08,471 --> 00:50:11,680
I don't know why he got hit up and
other people didn't get hit up.

1773
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:12,130
You know,

1774
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:12,790
you didn't get hit up.

1775
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:13,300
No,

1776
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,080
I got hit up.

1777
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,010
I don't understand it.

1778
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,020
You are you asking for money?

1779
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,140
Because I think it has something to do
with subscriptions are asking for money.

1780
00:50:20,141 --> 00:50:21,250
Did you ever ask for any money?

1781
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:21,590
No.

1782
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:25,040
I mean the only thing that we have at
desk squad is just buying t shirts,

1783
00:50:25,041 --> 00:50:27,920
which I have been trying
to keep a separate as from,

1784
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:28,100
you

1785
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:28,700
know,

1786
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,540
totally separate.

1787
00:50:29,541 --> 00:50:29,820
Right.

1788
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:30,860
That's just your tee shirts.

1789
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:31,320
Right.

1790
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,450
And if you want those folks,

1791
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:33,920
go to get desk squad.tv.

1792
00:50:33,921 --> 00:50:37,910
If you see those cats
and cat cats have flasks.

1793
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:38,990
We have you wearing right now?

1794
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:43,250
The one I have right now Capelle
and flasks flasks so he can,

1795
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,990
you can be one of those old timey drunks.

1796
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:48,830
Put up a warm flask of whiskey in your
back pocket as far gone it all day

1797
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:53,420
according to your coffee or protect
your chest pocket from bullets.

1798
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:53,751
Yeah.

1799
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:56,000
That doesn't happen upon
occasion by the way.

1800
00:50:56,001 --> 00:50:57,200
Thanks for the the fanny pack.

1801
00:50:57,201 --> 00:50:57,771
I like it a lot.

1802
00:50:57,771 --> 00:50:58,371
She's like,

1803
00:50:58,371 --> 00:50:58,911
it's really,

1804
00:50:58,911 --> 00:51:02,690
and the first thing I thought of could
I toyed with dice was dice would go nice

1805
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,740
nuts for this and you're like,

1806
00:51:03,741 --> 00:51:03,970
yeah,

1807
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:05,270
dynasties had something to do with it.

1808
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:08,540
I'm like a dice got a roots
fanny pack and he was wearing,

1809
00:51:08,541 --> 00:51:09,530
it was beautiful and I was like,

1810
00:51:09,531 --> 00:51:11,930
what'd you get that fanny
pack or it go check it out.

1811
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,850
And he gave it to me to check out and
I ordered one from roots and then I

1812
00:51:16,851 --> 00:51:20,330
contacted roots and I had them design
mind with the higher primary logo on it.

1813
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:20,961
So good.

1814
00:51:20,961 --> 00:51:23,210
So I'm selling those fucking fanny packs.

1815
00:51:23,211 --> 00:51:24,020
The way to go.

1816
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,300
People are scared of fanny packs.

1817
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,690
Let me explain something to you.

1818
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,610
A girl who will not fuck you because
you're wearing a fanny pack was not going

1819
00:51:30,611 --> 00:51:31,550
to fuck you anyway.

1820
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:32,181
Absolutely.

1821
00:51:32,181 --> 00:51:33,200
And if she was going to fuck you,

1822
00:51:33,201 --> 00:51:34,340
it wasn't going to be worth it.

1823
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,390
It was going to be one of
those where she fucks you.

1824
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:36,810
She's like,

1825
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:37,390
oh,

1826
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:38,330
like what am I doing?

1827
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:38,801
Plus I'm not,

1828
00:51:38,801 --> 00:51:40,340
I don't try to get laid in my fanny pack.

1829
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:40,610
I don't,

1830
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:41,600
I don't want to get a little club.

1831
00:51:41,601 --> 00:51:42,740
We're in a fucking fanny pack.

1832
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:43,970
I wear it when I fly.

1833
00:51:43,971 --> 00:51:45,800
I like to fly comfortably
and people are always like,

1834
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,300
what are you wearing that for?

1835
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:48,980
Cause I don't want to shit in my pockets.

1836
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:49,371
That's why.

1837
00:51:49,371 --> 00:51:49,661
Sorry.

1838
00:51:49,661 --> 00:51:51,890
Let's close to look like
the Fonz on a fucking plane.

1839
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:53,270
There's like a baby.

1840
00:51:53,271 --> 00:51:53,720
I'm done.

1841
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,160
Why am I doing the Fonz fucking,

1842
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,880
you know what the fines is?

1843
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,830
Why I try to be a fucking
cool image on the plane.

1844
00:52:00,831 --> 00:52:01,760
It's like I'm flying,

1845
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:01,960
I'm,

1846
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,620
I'm right from the airport right now.

1847
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,560
I'm wearing my oversize Ozzie shirt,

1848
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,430
my sweat pants.

1849
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:06,950
It's like that.

1850
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:09,830
You fly to be comfortable and
that's such an easy thing to do.

1851
00:52:09,831 --> 00:52:10,880
You take that thing off,

1852
00:52:10,881 --> 00:52:13,160
put it in the tray that goes through,

1853
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:13,880
you're done,

1854
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,750
clip it back on.

1855
00:52:14,751 --> 00:52:16,090
You don't have to empty your pockets out.

1856
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,010
It doesn't include as one of your carry
ons either when you have it around your

1857
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:19,351
weight,

1858
00:52:19,351 --> 00:52:22,340
so if you have like a
backpack and a suitcase,

1859
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:25,310
you can also have a fanny pack attached
to your body so it doesn't count as not

1860
00:52:25,311 --> 00:52:25,820
true.

1861
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:26,090
No.

1862
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:28,350
Does certain comments really?

1863
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:31,760
I had a woman tell me that I had to
take it off and I put it in my back.

1864
00:52:31,761 --> 00:52:32,240
I'm like,

1865
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:32,871
are you serious?

1866
00:52:32,871 --> 00:52:33,201
I go,

1867
00:52:33,201 --> 00:52:34,670
what's the difference
between this and the pocket?

1868
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:35,370
She goes,

1869
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:36,171
it's a bag,

1870
00:52:36,171 --> 00:52:36,680
sir.

1871
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,350
You have to have your bag inside another
bag or you're going to have to check.

1872
00:52:39,351 --> 00:52:40,760
It should just be in a con.

1873
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:41,960
She of course she was and I was like,

1874
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:42,651
oh Jesus,

1875
00:52:42,651 --> 00:52:43,580
fucking Christ.

1876
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:45,650
But you can't say you're being
a con because that's a really,

1877
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:47,360
that's the little Chella plane.

1878
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:48,253
She was conti.

1879
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:48,861
She of course she was.

1880
00:52:48,861 --> 00:52:50,870
So I just opened up my backpack.

1881
00:52:50,871 --> 00:52:51,770
It's stuffed it in there.

1882
00:52:51,771 --> 00:52:52,131
But I was like,

1883
00:52:52,131 --> 00:52:53,540
this is the dumbest fucking shit ever.

1884
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:54,250
Like he said her,

1885
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:57,020
I'm sitting by the way in my
seat when she said this to me.

1886
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:57,531
Wait,

1887
00:52:57,531 --> 00:52:58,250
you on the plane?

1888
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:58,730
Yes.

1889
00:52:58,730 --> 00:52:59,361
On the plane.

1890
00:52:59,361 --> 00:53:02,420
Sitting in my seat with my
belt buckled the whole deal.

1891
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,050
So I had to take off the fanny pack
and put it in my fucking backpack.

1892
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:06,740
The one,

1893
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:11,060
one time only for this one chick
that just decided that's ridiculous.

1894
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,110
You know,

1895
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:13,010
that's what happens man.

1896
00:53:13,011 --> 00:53:14,150
You run into the wrong person.

1897
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:16,220
What is it that a major
airline or was it a,

1898
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,210
a subsidiary,

1899
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:18,650
like a smaller,

1900
00:53:18,651 --> 00:53:18,891
like,

1901
00:53:18,891 --> 00:53:19,071
you know,

1902
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:19,904
you have your Delta,

1903
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:20,931
you have delta,

1904
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:22,340
but was it a big plan or a small plan?

1905
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:22,930
Okay.

1906
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:24,080
Cause a lot of times the ones on this,

1907
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:24,950
like you had continental,

1908
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:25,800
the continental express,

1909
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:26,400
United,

1910
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,760
United Express and the United expressing
Cottonelle expressed there are other

1911
00:53:29,761 --> 00:53:32,430
airlines or American Eagle
that's not American Airlines.

1912
00:53:32,431 --> 00:53:36,240
There are a smaller airline
operating with the American logo.

1913
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:38,190
So there are totally separate airline.

1914
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,480
So what will happen is,

1915
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:40,020
uh,

1916
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:40,351
you know,

1917
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:40,591
they,

1918
00:53:40,591 --> 00:53:44,490
they to me on the smaller planes are
fucking worst with the regulations.

1919
00:53:44,491 --> 00:53:45,660
Headphones out please.

1920
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,670
Like whether you were
listening to music or not.

1921
00:53:47,671 --> 00:53:49,390
And it never happened
to me on a big plane.

1922
00:53:49,391 --> 00:53:51,240
It was always those little American Eagle,

1923
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:51,871
United Express,

1924
00:53:51,871 --> 00:53:52,890
continental express or whatever.

1925
00:53:52,891 --> 00:53:56,030
The delta was weird cause
you're not operating,

1926
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,690
they are operating some equipment.

1927
00:53:57,691 --> 00:53:59,400
It's like a Corgan express.

1928
00:53:59,401 --> 00:54:01,680
Whoever the fuck it's called
is the actual airline.

1929
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:04,440
They use United paint
and United ticketing,

1930
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:07,890
but they're operating kind of as a
courier service for United or whoever the

1931
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:08,813
when they are.

1932
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:09,501
Yeah.

1933
00:54:09,501 --> 00:54:10,311
I don't know man.

1934
00:54:10,311 --> 00:54:10,610
It's,

1935
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:12,980
it's gotta be a tough Gig
to be a flight attendant.

1936
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:13,640
Sure.

1937
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,360
But she,

1938
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,010
that's just creating issues.

1939
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:17,540
There's no need to do that.

1940
00:54:17,541 --> 00:54:17,710
I'm,

1941
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:19,340
I'm friendly if you're with me.

1942
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:20,510
I've never get an initial,

1943
00:54:20,511 --> 00:54:20,751
I mean,

1944
00:54:20,751 --> 00:54:21,800
I even argue with her,

1945
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:22,551
I said,

1946
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:22,971
really,

1947
00:54:22,971 --> 00:54:23,781
I got to take this off.

1948
00:54:23,781 --> 00:54:24,081
And she goes,

1949
00:54:24,081 --> 00:54:24,531
yes sir.

1950
00:54:24,531 --> 00:54:24,980
That's about it.

1951
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:25,160
I'm like,

1952
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:25,610
all right,

1953
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:26,540
just put it in my bag.

1954
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:27,410
I'm done.

1955
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:27,651
You know,

1956
00:54:27,651 --> 00:54:27,891
I'm not,

1957
00:54:27,891 --> 00:54:28,130
I don't,

1958
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:28,400
yeah,

1959
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,233
I don't need to.

1960
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,700
But that's just creating
an issue for no reason.

1961
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:36,701
I saw a man and another man getting a
mild dispute about something and this

1962
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:40,880
woman who was the flight attendant
treated bolted them like they were fucking

1963
00:54:40,881 --> 00:54:44,000
children and just rode it into the ground,

1964
00:54:44,001 --> 00:54:45,080
didn't let it go.

1965
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:46,700
Brought out the pilot,

1966
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:47,750
made the pilot,

1967
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:48,680
talked to both men.

1968
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:50,270
Totally unnecessary.

1969
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:51,560
What were they disputing though?

1970
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:55,040
There would be disputing overhead
space and this is what happened.

1971
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:55,520
Um,

1972
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:00,520
a guy had more than one thing in an
overhead and another guy went to put

1973
00:55:00,981 --> 00:55:02,000
something in.

1974
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:05,330
He like opened up the thing and
there was no space in there.

1975
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,430
And I think you said something like,

1976
00:55:07,431 --> 00:55:07,701
you know,

1977
00:55:07,701 --> 00:55:08,300
you've got,

1978
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:08,631
you know,

1979
00:55:08,631 --> 00:55:10,100
why do you have two things in there?

1980
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:10,911
And the guy said,

1981
00:55:10,911 --> 00:55:11,091
hey,

1982
00:55:11,091 --> 00:55:12,560
first come first serve.

1983
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:14,240
And the other guy says bull shit.

1984
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:15,470
And he sits down,

1985
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:16,483
that's it.

1986
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:17,681
The one guy,

1987
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:18,650
he's got two bags,

1988
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:20,390
he puts it in there and he goes,

1989
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:20,960
there's no,

1990
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,010
there's no room for other people.

1991
00:55:22,011 --> 00:55:22,191
It goes,

1992
00:55:22,191 --> 00:55:22,311
Hey,

1993
00:55:22,311 --> 00:55:22,761
first come,

1994
00:55:22,761 --> 00:55:23,390
first serve.

1995
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:23,931
They got a guy,

1996
00:55:23,931 --> 00:55:25,040
he goes bull shit.

1997
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:26,090
And he sits down.

1998
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:27,620
That's the whole dispute.

1999
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,360
The woman wouldn't let
the guy have a drink.

2000
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:30,350
The guy asked for a drink.

2001
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:30,860
She goes,

2002
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:31,190
no,

2003
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:34,070
you're not going to have a drink if I
decide to let you have a drink later,

2004
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,060
I'll let you have a drink.

2005
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:35,960
She brought out the f,

2006
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:36,251
the,

2007
00:55:36,251 --> 00:55:36,331
uh,

2008
00:55:36,331 --> 00:55:36,860
the,

2009
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:37,141
the,

2010
00:55:37,141 --> 00:55:37,340
uh,

2011
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,920
pilots and she even talked to me.

2012
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:40,431
She was like,

2013
00:55:40,431 --> 00:55:41,570
if things go crazy,

2014
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:41,991
you know,

2015
00:55:41,991 --> 00:55:43,730
if either one of these
guys gets out of line,

2016
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:44,061
you know,

2017
00:55:44,061 --> 00:55:45,010
I'm looking to you to,

2018
00:55:45,011 --> 00:55:46,040
to take care of this.

2019
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:46,880
And I'm like,

2020
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:47,541
Oh yeah,

2021
00:55:47,541 --> 00:55:48,560
all these fucking,

2022
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:49,310
these guys aren't,

2023
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:50,143
no one's getting out of,

2024
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,640
you're creating something out of nothing.

2025
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:55,520
But she kept harping on him and pestering.

2026
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:58,280
You know how there's some people
that if they get in an argument about

2027
00:55:58,281 --> 00:55:58,940
something,

2028
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,050
like whatever it is,

2029
00:56:00,051 --> 00:56:00,370
if they,

2030
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:00,650
they,

2031
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:02,240
there's something that winds them up.

2032
00:56:02,241 --> 00:56:03,110
Even if it's minor,

2033
00:56:03,111 --> 00:56:06,110
they will beat it into the
ground until it becomes major.

2034
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,340
They'll just ride you,

2035
00:56:07,341 --> 00:56:08,091
ride your ride,

2036
00:56:08,091 --> 00:56:08,841
you until you,

2037
00:56:08,841 --> 00:56:10,100
what could you shut the fuck up?

2038
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:14,210
It's almost like she was trying to
get these guys to blow up so she could

2039
00:56:14,211 --> 00:56:15,680
justify her,

2040
00:56:15,681 --> 00:56:17,510
whatever internal strife,

2041
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:21,470
her internal anger that she was
projecting onto the situation,

2042
00:56:21,471 --> 00:56:23,090
but I saw the whole thing go down.

2043
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:24,190
It was so minor.

2044
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,390
Either that or she was on a flight,

2045
00:56:25,391 --> 00:56:26,680
ones were too drunk,

2046
00:56:26,681 --> 00:56:29,740
began arguing and the flight got
diverted and then she was late.

2047
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:32,890
She was supposed to meet a guy with a
huge Dick and she missed it because their

2048
00:56:32,891 --> 00:56:34,420
plane had to land in De Moines.

2049
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,020
I like your story better because my story,

2050
00:56:38,021 --> 00:56:39,760
she's just fucking measly.

2051
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:41,470
Cut My story.

2052
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:44,140
She was fucking on her way to get some
giant Dick and she didn't want either one

2053
00:56:44,141 --> 00:56:46,000
of these fucking petty
zilch is to interfere.

2054
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:51,820
It was just was the
way she talked to them.

2055
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:53,860
It was like she had a green light.

2056
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:54,260
Sure.

2057
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:56,160
To say what she wanted it
and push the issue is hard.

2058
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:57,310
They really do.

2059
00:56:57,311 --> 00:56:57,671
And look,

2060
00:56:57,671 --> 00:56:59,190
I mean after nine 11 we all change that.

2061
00:56:59,191 --> 00:57:01,150
We saw flying and we got to
give them a lot of leeway.

2062
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,520
But it does get to be a point where
you have to be able to go like,

2063
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:03,791
look,

2064
00:57:03,791 --> 00:57:06,070
you're being a fucking
complete and utter twat.

2065
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:06,580
Right.

2066
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:08,100
But you can never say that anymore ever.

2067
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,780
I do look at situations very differently.

2068
00:57:10,781 --> 00:57:13,000
If I see people getting
into dispute on an airplane,

2069
00:57:13,001 --> 00:57:13,131
I,

2070
00:57:13,131 --> 00:57:15,100
I do look at it like as a potential.

2071
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:15,551
I mean,

2072
00:57:15,551 --> 00:57:17,950
I don't look at it as like
a terrorist situation,

2073
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:19,960
but I do look at it as a potential like,

2074
00:57:19,961 --> 00:57:20,380
whoa,

2075
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:20,980
you know,

2076
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,660
people do bad shit to each other.

2077
00:57:22,661 --> 00:57:24,220
Sometimes bad shit can go down.

2078
00:57:24,221 --> 00:57:24,670
Sure.

2079
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:27,760
And people are still allowed to carry a
lot of fucking dangerous shit on planes.

2080
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:31,820
They took away pool cues and they took
away knives and a few things and they

2081
00:57:31,821 --> 00:57:34,030
were going to bring back
pocket knives and pool cues,

2082
00:57:34,031 --> 00:57:35,710
but then they changed it because,

2083
00:57:35,711 --> 00:57:36,220
uh,

2084
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:36,881
what happened?

2085
00:57:36,881 --> 00:57:37,714
Someone did something,

2086
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:37,991
oh,

2087
00:57:37,991 --> 00:57:41,980
that guy showed up in lax and
shot a bunch of TSA workers.

2088
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:44,080
Remember that he killed
that one TSA worker,

2089
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:45,800
that Guy May,

2090
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:48,910
they pulled back this regulation change
that they were going to have because of

2091
00:57:48,911 --> 00:57:49,660
this guy.

2092
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:52,000
But people still bring skateboards on.

2093
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:55,000
You could fuck somebody up
on a scale Mac book pro,

2094
00:57:55,001 --> 00:57:58,510
even that Shit's fucking titanium or
just let it get it all or close it while

2095
00:57:58,511 --> 00:57:59,041
it's still on.

2096
00:57:59,041 --> 00:58:00,400
Cause they always heat up
and then say to somebody,

2097
00:58:00,401 --> 00:58:00,910
hold us down.

2098
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:01,130
I'm like,

2099
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:01,380
ah,

2100
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:02,010
I'm struggle.

2101
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:04,690
I'm really passive way
to beat somebody up.

2102
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:05,501
Yeah.

2103
00:58:05,501 --> 00:58:09,280
Especially if you rubbed the bottom of
it and get it all friction knee rubbing

2104
00:58:09,281 --> 00:58:10,840
on them and watch them
get shocked and burn.

2105
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,030
But yeah,

2106
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:12,370
the,

2107
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:16,690
the idea of a violence on a plane
just freaks a lot of people out.

2108
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,610
And again,

2109
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,750
the diversion of the flight,

2110
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:24,880
we've seen too many videos of guys yelling
and screaming or that one fucking buy

2111
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:28,060
Polak cut wherever they're
from trying to open the door.

2112
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:28,571
Oh yeah.

2113
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:29,470
I think a big part of it,

2114
00:58:29,471 --> 00:58:32,380
and we've seen so much more than the last
20 something years because there's no

2115
00:58:32,381 --> 00:58:34,030
more smoking on planes and I'm glad.

2116
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:38,110
But I think a lot of what you see in
rageful situations is people jonesing for

2117
00:58:38,111 --> 00:58:38,944
cigarettes.

2118
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,050
Because there were times where
I couldn't have a cigarette.

2119
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:45,220
Best thing I would do is quit smoking
in 2001 but when I'd be on a flight,

2120
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:45,871
if we were going to move,

2121
00:58:45,871 --> 00:58:46,750
when I was opening for dice,

2122
00:58:46,751 --> 00:58:47,620
we're going to Dallas.

2123
00:58:47,621 --> 00:58:48,840
It said it was an hour delay of,

2124
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:49,361
fuck,

2125
00:58:49,361 --> 00:58:50,290
that's another hour.

2126
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:51,670
I can't smoke.

2127
00:58:51,671 --> 00:58:52,550
And you start your body,

2128
00:58:52,551 --> 00:58:54,100
you start to feel that fucking,

2129
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:55,510
that withdrawal.

2130
00:58:55,511 --> 00:58:59,800
And a lot of people are probably going
through that on planes and freaking out

2131
00:58:59,801 --> 00:59:01,180
that they can't smoke.

2132
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:01,361
Oh,

2133
00:59:01,361 --> 00:59:03,360
I guarantee and I'm glad
they can't smell it,

2134
00:59:03,361 --> 00:59:04,360
but I think that's a part of,

2135
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:06,070
and then it'll get the fucking petty do.

2136
00:59:06,071 --> 00:59:07,450
She's not even letting you have the fake.

2137
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,190
Some of the fake cigarettes do smell.

2138
00:59:09,191 --> 00:59:10,024
Kurt Metzger,

2139
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:10,450
uh,

2140
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:13,870
who's a good friend of mine was writing
for the show that I'm doing with smoke.

2141
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:15,550
These fucking things in the editing bay.

2142
00:59:15,551 --> 00:59:19,510
They smelled like vanilla bark and they
are nowhere near as offensive as a real

2143
00:59:19,511 --> 00:59:20,290
cigarette.

2144
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:23,000
But it was still like was
like a sweet ass hole wafting.

2145
00:59:23,001 --> 00:59:24,800
It was like the fuck you doing.

2146
00:59:24,801 --> 00:59:27,530
He had one that was smoking in
here for why it was strawberry.

2147
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:28,070
Eh,

2148
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:28,311
well the,

2149
00:59:28,311 --> 00:59:28,581
you know,

2150
00:59:28,581 --> 00:59:31,310
the thing I'm reading about those is
they don't know if that shit safe cause

2151
00:59:31,311 --> 00:59:32,270
you're breathing something.

2152
00:59:32,271 --> 00:59:33,140
It's not vapor.

2153
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,690
You breathing something
that has something in it,

2154
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:36,410
you know?

2155
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:38,270
And there's no studies
that have been done on it.

2156
00:59:38,271 --> 00:59:41,510
There's no studies about the
secondhand smoke and whatever it is.

2157
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:41,681
It's,

2158
00:59:41,681 --> 00:59:44,450
it's also you're making
someone breathe your smell.

2159
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:44,700
Yeah.

2160
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:44,920
You know,

2161
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:45,370
it's,

2162
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:47,330
it's like if you were
spraying perfume in the area,

2163
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:48,171
I'd be like,

2164
00:59:48,171 --> 00:59:49,010
come on fuck head.

2165
00:59:49,011 --> 00:59:49,910
Why he's spraying perfume.

2166
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,460
Making people aware of your scent.

2167
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,600
Like wearing perfume.

2168
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:54,070
Yeah.

2169
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:55,280
Women don't know how to wear perfume.

2170
00:59:55,281 --> 00:59:55,610
Right.

2171
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:56,270
Some do.

2172
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:56,810
Most of them.

2173
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:58,070
You're generalizing that crazy.

2174
00:59:58,290 --> 00:59:58,970
Yeah.

2175
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:02,150
I mean you can go anywhere where
there's women in smell perfume.

2176
01:00:02,151 --> 01:00:03,290
If you focus in on it,

2177
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:03,591
you know,

2178
01:00:03,591 --> 01:00:05,510
like why am I smelling
having to smell this?

2179
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:09,560
I was in a restaurant recently and
some guy had one of those big ass vapor

2180
01:00:09,561 --> 01:00:10,394
pipes.

2181
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:10,761
I mean,

2182
01:00:10,761 --> 01:00:15,320
it was like a big fat tube one that
he was puffing on and the fucking,

2183
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,800
it was filling the restaurant with smart.

2184
01:00:17,801 --> 01:00:18,290
Right.

2185
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:23,290
But because it's like a vapor pipe or
whatever the fuck it's supposed to be and

2186
01:00:23,361 --> 01:00:25,310
not lighting a fire,

2187
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:26,870
it's supposedly okay.

2188
01:00:26,871 --> 01:00:27,500
But I'm like,

2189
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,430
this is crazy.

2190
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:30,290
Because I was eating with
my kids and I was like,

2191
01:00:30,291 --> 01:00:31,940
we're sitting here in this guy smoke.

2192
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:32,241
Right.

2193
01:00:32,241 --> 01:00:33,200
It was a lot of it.

2194
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:33,651
I mean,

2195
01:00:33,651 --> 01:00:35,300
he was taking these and you could see it.

2196
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:37,460
It wasn't like those blue cigarettes,

2197
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:38,271
you know those things,

2198
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:40,130
those sharia blue e-cigs.

2199
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,210
When you blow those out,

2200
01:00:41,211 --> 01:00:43,040
it's like it's up and
it's gone in seconds.

2201
01:00:43,041 --> 01:00:44,420
It doesn't have any smell this.

2202
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:45,530
That's kind of what I'm thinking.

2203
01:00:45,531 --> 01:00:46,010
Yeah.

2204
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:47,510
Those are the ones that are okay.

2205
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:48,201
But those,

2206
01:00:48,201 --> 01:00:49,550
those fat ones that are like,

2207
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:51,740
they're all different in
their delivery method.

2208
01:00:51,741 --> 01:00:52,371
They're all different.

2209
01:00:52,371 --> 01:00:52,561
And the,

2210
01:00:52,561 --> 01:00:52,691
the,

2211
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:55,250
the way they burn the
oils and tobacco oil,

2212
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:56,750
some of them it's fucking smoke.

2213
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:57,800
It's smoke.

2214
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,041
I mean,

2215
01:00:58,041 --> 01:00:58,700
you're just,

2216
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,520
you're burning oil instead
of burning plant matter.

2217
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:01,941
Okay.

2218
01:01:01,941 --> 01:01:02,151
Yeah,

2219
01:01:02,151 --> 01:01:02,900
that's true.

2220
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:03,440
That's true.

2221
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:03,681
Yes.

2222
01:01:03,681 --> 01:01:04,341
Smokeless ones.

2223
01:01:04,341 --> 01:01:04,850
Now though.

2224
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:05,510
Awesome.

2225
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:05,990
Those,

2226
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:06,411
you know,

2227
01:01:06,411 --> 01:01:07,610
those you can't argue with.

2228
01:01:07,611 --> 01:01:10,190
And also gum nicotine
gum I guess is great.

2229
01:01:10,191 --> 01:01:12,380
He never helped me when other
smell go try it on planes.

2230
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:13,640
It tastes like pepper.

2231
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,530
I didn't never did anything for me.

2232
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:16,760
It makes me want to puke.

2233
01:01:16,761 --> 01:01:19,130
Almost Marin addicted to those.

2234
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:19,640
Yeah.

2235
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:20,810
A lot of such rich Veloce.

2236
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:23,000
This is how awful rich vos has is a human.

2237
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:27,590
He'll fucking come in studio and he'll
be with chewing them in mid story and

2238
01:01:27,591 --> 01:01:28,970
then he'll talk one up under his,

2239
01:01:28,971 --> 01:01:29,240
God,

2240
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,080
you've had Boston here.

2241
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:32,600
Oh and he'll eat that while
one is under his gums heal.

2242
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:33,650
Oh fucking God.

2243
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,060
He'll eat a tuna fish sandwich salad.

2244
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:37,100
The way he would say it to

2245
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:39,830
or,

2246
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:40,220
or you know,

2247
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:41,031
or fucking,

2248
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:41,864
you know,

2249
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:43,910
white fish whenever awful food he'll eat.

2250
01:01:43,911 --> 01:01:46,670
White fish is fucking
thing tucked up under,

2251
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:48,180
you know,

2252
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:49,310
verses a weird guy.

2253
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:50,030
Very.

2254
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:50,811
And he's one of my face.

2255
01:01:50,811 --> 01:01:53,360
He's really one of the most
underrated funny people.

2256
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:54,980
He's very funny and he's funny.

2257
01:01:54,981 --> 01:01:55,761
Off the cuff,

2258
01:01:55,761 --> 01:01:58,280
more so than it eve is on stage lightning.

2259
01:01:58,310 --> 01:01:59,450
This is a joke that we'd been quoting.

2260
01:01:59,451 --> 01:02:00,920
We had Pete rose in the other day.

2261
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:01,580
I listen.

2262
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:02,151
How did you hear that?

2263
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:03,680
And the lightens the line he had.

2264
01:02:03,681 --> 01:02:03,951
That was,

2265
01:02:03,951 --> 01:02:05,030
it was so fast.

2266
01:02:05,031 --> 01:02:05,271
It was,

2267
01:02:05,271 --> 01:02:06,440
it was almost depressing.

2268
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:07,770
Whereas a,

2269
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:09,440
I think Pete Rose said to Voss,

2270
01:02:09,441 --> 01:02:09,831
he goes,

2271
01:02:09,831 --> 01:02:10,161
uh hey,

2272
01:02:10,161 --> 01:02:10,581
you're a little,

2273
01:02:10,581 --> 01:02:12,170
when Bob Kelly was in and he goes,

2274
01:02:12,171 --> 01:02:12,921
you're a little winded.

2275
01:02:12,921 --> 01:02:17,921
Waskow's that's cause I had to walk
around you and Bobby like that fast.

2276
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:19,320
It was was,

2277
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:19,980
it was like he had been

2278
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,420
waiting for someone to say Voss,

2279
01:02:21,421 --> 01:02:22,200
you seem winded.

2280
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:22,740
Yeah.

2281
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,770
So just when you want to just take a
fucking a pick ax and hit rich in the

2282
01:02:25,771 --> 01:02:26,604
chest,

2283
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:28,740
he reminds you of his comedic brilliance.

2284
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:31,380
Like he'll do something like to have
the gun with the white fish and you hate

2285
01:02:31,381 --> 01:02:31,860
him.

2286
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:32,560
But then as I said,

2287
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,020
something that's so comedically brilliant,

2288
01:02:34,021 --> 01:02:34,640
like this guy,

2289
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,790
there's a genius to rich Voss.

2290
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:39,410
I love how you guys had just gotten done
talking about how no is going to sit in

2291
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:40,263
Anthony seed.

2292
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:42,150
You should probably put
a glass box around it.

2293
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:44,460
Boss comes in the room and the
first thing he does is sit in,

2294
01:02:44,461 --> 01:02:45,081
they have to be seated.

2295
01:02:45,081 --> 01:02:45,450
He goes,

2296
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:46,770
I never really liked that guy anyway.

2297
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:51,060
He's just a fucking Asberger's funny guy.

2298
01:02:51,061 --> 01:02:52,170
Like that's what Voss is.

2299
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:53,550
He's completely,

2300
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,320
he'll make fun of anybody.

2301
01:02:55,321 --> 01:02:56,550
He'll make fun of anything.

2302
01:02:56,550 --> 01:03:01,550
Like he kinda does a purity
to rich [inaudible] he's
fucking be just turned 57.

2303
01:03:01,891 --> 01:03:02,360
Yeah.

2304
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:02,700
Wow.

2305
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:05,180
He's really up there and
he's childish and uh,

2306
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:06,450
he's petty.

2307
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,470
How old is this kid?

2308
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:08,461
He's got a few.

2309
01:03:08,461 --> 01:03:09,660
He's got three is his daughter.

2310
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:11,820
Rain I think is six or
so with Bonnie or five.

2311
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,400
And there's other kids are
like in college when he was 52.

2312
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:15,120
Yeah.

2313
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:15,580
Wow.

2314
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:16,413
Yeah.

2315
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:17,520
Wow.

2316
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,540
And is that the kids are grown.

2317
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:19,650
They're like college age girls.

2318
01:03:19,651 --> 01:03:20,484
Wow.

2319
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:21,530
And uh,

2320
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:22,830
have you ever listened to their podcast?

2321
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:23,431
I have.

2322
01:03:23,431 --> 01:03:24,211
I did it once.

2323
01:03:24,211 --> 01:03:24,631
I did the,

2324
01:03:24,631 --> 01:03:25,140
uh,

2325
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:25,411
I was,

2326
01:03:25,411 --> 01:03:27,360
the guest is painful.

2327
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:30,930
I think bill burrs doing it in
Montreal where my wife hates me,

2328
01:03:30,931 --> 01:03:31,764
so brutal,

2329
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:33,303
so brutal.

2330
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,830
And she's so much faster than him.

2331
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:35,730
She's so smart.

2332
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:36,930
But it's so funny to listen.

2333
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,750
Nobody has a better sense of humor
about each other as a couple.

2334
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:41,880
Like I've seen them brutalize each other,

2335
01:03:41,881 --> 01:03:44,400
like the things that
would destroy me as a,

2336
01:03:44,401 --> 01:03:45,570
as a member of a couple.

2337
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:47,100
And they just laugh it
off and they're fine.

2338
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:50,400
I can't believe it for like two goldfish.

2339
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:53,160
Like they just forget the hatred
they spewed at each other.

2340
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:54,750
And the,

2341
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:54,901
yeah,

2342
01:03:54,901 --> 01:03:55,440
my wife,

2343
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,050
there's so funny together.

2344
01:03:58,051 --> 01:04:00,720
It's like gimme that's the relationship
the two comedians should have.

2345
01:04:00,721 --> 01:04:01,680
And I could never have one.

2346
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:01,891
Well,

2347
01:04:01,891 --> 01:04:03,300
it'd be a great reality show.

2348
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:03,580
Um,

2349
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:04,261
I'm amazing.

2350
01:04:04,261 --> 01:04:04,920
They don't have,

2351
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,090
because the business stinks.

2352
01:04:06,091 --> 01:04:09,990
That's why our show business stinks
that they haven't taken fucking rich and

2353
01:04:09,991 --> 01:04:10,690
Bonnie,

2354
01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:11,420
um,

2355
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:11,760
these,

2356
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,270
these two fucker presented anywhere a
million times and they're good at pitching

2357
01:04:15,271 --> 01:04:16,830
shows and Bonnie is really good at it.

2358
01:04:16,831 --> 01:04:17,311
And they're funny.

2359
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:18,144
And the meetings,

2360
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:19,520
uh,

2361
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,640
I don't know why they haven't,

2362
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:21,570
maybe because they don't,

2363
01:04:21,571 --> 01:04:22,404
uh,

2364
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:23,311
I dunno.

2365
01:04:23,311 --> 01:04:24,240
I was just saying maybe
they don't want that.

2366
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:25,530
I couldn't even think
of a followup resign.

2367
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:25,710
He's,

2368
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:28,770
the only thing that I could think
of is that shows with comedians.

2369
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:29,431
I mean,

2370
01:04:29,431 --> 01:04:34,060
how many reality shows with comedians
have there been Tammy Pesky tell you how

2371
01:04:34,061 --> 01:04:34,890
to show for a while.

2372
01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:36,060
Remember that and I do not.

2373
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:37,133
Um,

2374
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:40,950
who else has anybody
mean last comic standing?

2375
01:04:40,951 --> 01:04:45,951
It's kind of a reality because comedians
are to Pauly shore killed the whole

2376
01:04:46,141 --> 01:04:50,010
fucking genre or is it because
comics are actually concise,

2377
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:55,011
funny and not situational like or
comedians are not goofy situation.

2378
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:59,550
Funny like all doesn't realize
she's putting pepper on her oatmeal,

2379
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:00,361
you know,

2380
01:05:00,361 --> 01:05:01,194
like,

2381
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:02,180
like you know,

2382
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:05,040
every dump cut in a reality
show does something stupid.

2383
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:05,910
I'm going to look for a walk.

2384
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:08,460
[inaudible] but home it's upside down.

2385
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:10,171
Six,

2386
01:05:10,171 --> 01:05:10,921
seven car.

2387
01:05:10,921 --> 01:05:11,671
My keys.

2388
01:05:11,671 --> 01:05:12,504
You're holding him.

2389
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:13,650
Oh yeah.

2390
01:05:13,651 --> 01:05:16,290
And comics would just dissect
comics or two in the moment.

2391
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:18,670
This is how dumb we are as
comedians will say like,

2392
01:05:18,671 --> 01:05:18,851
you know,

2393
01:05:18,851 --> 01:05:19,031
hey,

2394
01:05:19,031 --> 01:05:19,810
what do you want me to do?

2395
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:21,280
There's a guy with a camera looking at me.

2396
01:05:21,281 --> 01:05:21,510
Why?

2397
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:21,880
You know,

2398
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,260
we acknowledged too much.

2399
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:23,830
Right?

2400
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:24,820
I did family jewels,

2401
01:05:24,821 --> 01:05:28,540
I roasted gene and then they wanted me
to do this kind of like pseudo reality

2402
01:05:28,541 --> 01:05:30,460
thing at the end with gene and his wife.

2403
01:05:30,461 --> 01:05:31,990
And and someone else,

2404
01:05:31,991 --> 01:05:33,280
but of course like a Douche.

2405
01:05:33,281 --> 01:05:34,690
I referenced the camera guy and be like,

2406
01:05:34,691 --> 01:05:34,850
yeah,

2407
01:05:34,850 --> 01:05:37,450
you're not supposed to
mention that he's here.

2408
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:38,980
Maybe that's what it is.

2409
01:05:38,981 --> 01:05:39,910
Maybe we're too,

2410
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:42,100
we don't know how to shut the fuck up.

2411
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:43,090
I Love Gene Simmons.

2412
01:05:43,091 --> 01:05:44,050
I can't watch that show.

2413
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,250
It's just so God damn.

2414
01:05:45,251 --> 01:05:45,611
Fuck.

2415
01:05:45,611 --> 01:05:46,444
I love him too.

2416
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,200
I love him.

2417
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:47,951
I can't watch this.

2418
01:05:47,951 --> 01:05:48,820
I would saw him the other day.

2419
01:05:48,821 --> 01:05:50,550
He was at the glory
kickboxing fights in La.

2420
01:05:50,551 --> 01:05:52,000
It was fucking awesome to see him again.

2421
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:52,420
Yeah,

2422
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:54,340
but however I can't watch,

2423
01:05:54,341 --> 01:05:57,190
I did sit so much fuckery in those shows.

2424
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:58,960
There's no reality shows.

2425
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:04,170
Every reality show has
these fixed scenarios and
they're faking shit that like

2426
01:06:04,571 --> 01:06:05,760
you would never think they fake.

2427
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:06,760
Like there's certain,

2428
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,830
like they were talking about
those storage wars shows,

2429
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:09,191
you know,

2430
01:06:09,191 --> 01:06:11,110
they just fill those storage's.

2431
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:12,063
They fill them.

2432
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:13,090
They set it all up.

2433
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:14,013
It's all fake.

2434
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:14,861
But no one know.

2435
01:06:14,861 --> 01:06:15,491
Open the door.

2436
01:06:15,491 --> 01:06:16,660
We don't even know what's in there.

2437
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:17,740
What's an a typewriter?

2438
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:19,030
You fucking put it there.

2439
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:20,073
They put the,

2440
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:22,990
they put everything in those boxes.

2441
01:06:22,991 --> 01:06:23,920
It's all fake.

2442
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,230
You're hoping that they
opened one from fucking,

2443
01:06:26,231 --> 01:06:26,800
uh,

2444
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,900
from Hannibal lectors.

2445
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:28,780
One of his clients.

2446
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,740
Nice Limo with a fucking head in the jar.

2447
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:32,073
That'd be,

2448
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:33,063
that'd be a critic.

2449
01:06:33,470 --> 01:06:34,360
Hester Moffitt.

2450
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,390
You're hoping it's one of those,

2451
01:06:37,391 --> 01:06:37,601
but yeah,

2452
01:06:37,601 --> 01:06:37,931
you're right.

2453
01:06:37,931 --> 01:06:40,240
It's all fixed and the only
real one was the Osborne.

2454
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:42,700
Sharon said there was no take two ever.

2455
01:06:42,810 --> 01:06:43,600
They have to,

2456
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,160
because it was nine months of filming.

2457
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:46,690
They don't want to commit
to that kind of filming.

2458
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:50,110
They don't want to take the time it would
take because I think that my life is

2459
01:06:50,111 --> 01:06:51,460
fascinating and like,

2460
01:06:51,461 --> 01:06:51,920
wow.

2461
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,020
But I look at my life,

2462
01:06:53,021 --> 01:06:53,630
I'm like,

2463
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:54,280
all right.

2464
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,840
Episodic reality show.

2465
01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:56,703
Jim Norton.

2466
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:57,850
I wake up,

2467
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,140
I go do the radio,

2468
01:06:59,141 --> 01:06:59,681
I come hall,

2469
01:06:59,681 --> 01:07:00,514
I go to the gym.

2470
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:01,570
There's nothing there.

2471
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:04,570
Maybe a couple of funny lines
on the radio and me and the gym.

2472
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:06,100
I'm tired again.

2473
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:06,581
All right,

2474
01:07:06,581 --> 01:07:08,410
there's a minute of the show kill.

2475
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,490
Here's the real show.

2476
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,260
You getting prostitutes.

2477
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,153
I thought of that.

2478
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:14,590
I've tried to pitch that to
vice and they didn't want it.

2479
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:15,130
I'm like,

2480
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:16,450
I want to go look.

2481
01:07:16,451 --> 01:07:16,961
Here's the thing,

2482
01:07:16,961 --> 01:07:19,180
like I go from fucking
place to place in brothels.

2483
01:07:19,181 --> 01:07:21,400
I give you reviews and they're just like,

2484
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:21,771
no one,

2485
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:22,750
they said no.

2486
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:25,420
Well like what's entertaining about
finding like me getting blow jobs,

2487
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:26,081
everything,

2488
01:07:26,081 --> 01:07:28,510
but they won't show the blow jobs and
the hookers probably wouldn't sign up for

2489
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:31,810
it cause they don't have to have a big
blurry thing over everybody's head.

2490
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:32,710
I,

2491
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:33,610
here's what I want it to do.

2492
01:07:33,611 --> 01:07:35,680
This was my idea for a reality segment.

2493
01:07:35,681 --> 01:07:38,770
I really want it to do this with
massage girls because I fucking like,

2494
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:41,080
like I'm drinking this
any type of milk product.

2495
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:46,140
I'm fucking a horrible farter and I
really wanted to take a hidden camera and

2496
01:07:46,211 --> 01:07:51,211
have massage girls come over and just
somehow like signal the camera when I'm

2497
01:07:51,371 --> 01:07:52,510
going to cut a gasser like,

2498
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:53,710
like I'll say beforehand,

2499
01:07:53,890 --> 01:07:55,600
every time I say the word yellow,

2500
01:07:55,601 --> 01:07:57,340
it means I'm about to Fart so that you'll,

2501
01:07:57,341 --> 01:07:58,570
you'll see me on there and I'll go like,

2502
01:07:58,571 --> 01:07:58,721
you know,

2503
01:07:58,721 --> 01:07:59,201
like yeah,

2504
01:07:59,201 --> 01:07:59,511
something,

2505
01:07:59,511 --> 01:08:03,100
something yellow and then I'll fart
maybe quietly and then you can watch her

2506
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:04,293
react.

2507
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:07,660
But the problem is you
can't show the face.

2508
01:08:07,661 --> 01:08:07,901
And,

2509
01:08:07,901 --> 01:08:09,700
and too many of them would say no to that,

2510
01:08:10,650 --> 01:08:11,620
but that's what I wanted to do.

2511
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:12,191
But how am I,

2512
01:08:12,191 --> 01:08:14,860
how long would that be interesting
Jim farts during massages.

2513
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:15,080
Yeah,

2514
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,130
but you say that people

2515
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:16,551
wouldn't,

2516
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:18,050
like you couldn't go to brothels,

2517
01:08:18,051 --> 01:08:20,270
but you could if the
girls were porn stars.

2518
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:21,133
That's true.

2519
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:21,831
That is true.

2520
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:22,611
And I would do that.

2521
01:08:22,611 --> 01:08:23,444
I would love to do that.

2522
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:26,090
But then I'm like Collin
Quinn a long time ago,

2523
01:08:26,091 --> 01:08:27,020
remind me many,

2524
01:08:27,021 --> 01:08:27,461
many years.

2525
01:08:27,461 --> 01:08:27,950
My first,

2526
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:28,761
I go on an opiate addict.

2527
01:08:28,761 --> 01:08:31,520
I was dating a British girl
and she was a real pervert.

2528
01:08:31,521 --> 01:08:32,780
Like I drove a Saturn back then.

2529
01:08:32,781 --> 01:08:36,590
I still lived in Jersey and I used to
fucking park outside of Dangerfield and

2530
01:08:36,591 --> 01:08:37,371
she would blow me.

2531
01:08:37,371 --> 01:08:37,941
I would trap.

2532
01:08:37,941 --> 01:08:41,240
She liked been to trap her head under
my steering wheel and she'd go like,

2533
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:42,350
I want you to bite me.

2534
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:43,460
I want you to bite me.

2535
01:08:43,461 --> 01:08:48,320
Like she would repeat this mantra
of me biting her on her back.

2536
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:49,960
But she liked to be bitten and brutalized.

2537
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:50,640
Wow.

2538
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,040
So would bite her back and she'd be like,

2539
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:53,330
I want you to make me suck it.

2540
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:57,080
And then I would hold her head under
the wheel and she'll be trapped under my

2541
01:08:57,081 --> 01:08:58,310
Saturday steering wheel

2542
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:01,311
and fucking,

2543
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:04,070
she would suck my dick and lick
my balls and whatever could kid.

2544
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:04,911
She was a good girl.

2545
01:09:04,911 --> 01:09:05,091
Yeah.

2546
01:09:05,091 --> 01:09:05,810
Her name is Ruth.

2547
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:07,040
She was a really cool girl.

2548
01:09:07,041 --> 01:09:07,430
Ruth.

2549
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:07,671
Yeah.

2550
01:09:07,671 --> 01:09:09,080
Good five and talked to her in 15 years.

2551
01:09:09,081 --> 01:09:10,430
But she was a great girl.

2552
01:09:10,431 --> 01:09:11,300
I miss her terribly.

2553
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,120
I think she went back across the pond.

2554
01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:14,900
Hello?

2555
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:15,733
As they say.

2556
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:17,180
And what was the point of this story?

2557
01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:17,661
Oh,

2558
01:09:17,661 --> 01:09:18,494
Collin College,

2559
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,570
she was really loud when I ate her pussy.

2560
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:23,950
Really super loud and it was say,

2561
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:24,711
I don't remember.

2562
01:09:24,711 --> 01:09:25,700
It's just moaning and groaning.

2563
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:28,790
Gb One of those things.

2564
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:29,624
Yeah,

2565
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:31,250
yeah,

2566
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:31,550
the,

2567
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:32,060
yeah.

2568
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:32,893
He said whatever it was.

2569
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:33,250
Ooh,

2570
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:33,380
look,

2571
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:35,870
I with my,

2572
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:38,901
my pussy,

2573
01:09:38,901 --> 01:09:40,220
like it's Manchester United,

2574
01:09:40,221 --> 01:09:41,054
you know what I'm saying?

2575
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:44,390
But I can't,

2576
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:48,080
it was a really loud and it
puts you a sloppy fucking wet.

2577
01:09:48,081 --> 01:09:48,980
Like it was legit.

2578
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:53,240
Like I knew she wasn't putting on
a show cause her pussy was sloppy.

2579
01:09:53,710 --> 01:09:55,440
But I was going to eat her
pussy on the air opiate.

2580
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:56,271
This is before I was there,

2581
01:09:56,271 --> 01:09:57,380
like a every day and it will be,

2582
01:09:57,381 --> 01:09:58,790
it's said quality and
your pussy on the air.

2583
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:02,270
And I was going to do that and
Colin Quinn stopped me and he goes,

2584
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:02,550
ah,

2585
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:03,051
you know,

2586
01:10:03,051 --> 01:10:03,621
and he goes,

2587
01:10:03,621 --> 01:10:04,460
you can do that.

2588
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:04,911
He goes,

2589
01:10:04,911 --> 01:10:05,211
but man,

2590
01:10:05,211 --> 01:10:05,811
you're a comic.

2591
01:10:05,811 --> 01:10:06,950
You got to say funny shit.

2592
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:10,160
You don't want to be that
guy that does wacky things.

2593
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:10,641
And I'm like,

2594
01:10:10,641 --> 01:10:11,750
I never forgot that.

2595
01:10:11,751 --> 01:10:12,471
He was almost telling me,

2596
01:10:12,471 --> 01:10:13,760
don't be a stunt boy.

2597
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:15,710
You gotta say it funny.

2598
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:20,690
You got to sit there and be funny verbally
and I maybe in that case he was right

2599
01:10:20,691 --> 01:10:21,410
because I wasn't the guy,

2600
01:10:21,410 --> 01:10:23,750
the Wacko who called up
at eight pussy on the air.

2601
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:27,590
It's like I have to be able to
be funny in my delivery and say,

2602
01:10:27,591 --> 01:10:27,891
and I was like,

2603
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:28,371
eh.

2604
01:10:28,371 --> 01:10:29,630
It was kind of a good point.

2605
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:30,860
I'm looking back in hindsight,

2606
01:10:30,861 --> 01:10:32,240
I probably should have
eaten her pussy on the arcs.

2607
01:10:32,241 --> 01:10:33,230
It'd be a very funny clip.

2608
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:33,740
Yeah,

2609
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:34,760
I know what you're saying though.

2610
01:10:34,761 --> 01:10:35,690
I know what he was saying.

2611
01:10:35,691 --> 01:10:36,140
Yeah.

2612
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:39,470
You can get stuck in that
trap of being the stunt guy,

2613
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,380
having a one up yourself every time.

2614
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:41,481
Like,

2615
01:10:41,481 --> 01:10:41,811
oh no,

2616
01:10:41,811 --> 01:10:43,340
Jim Norton did this crazy thing.

2617
01:10:43,341 --> 01:10:44,180
He put his ass hole,

2618
01:10:44,181 --> 01:10:45,014
his finger in his ass.

2619
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:45,480
It's like,

2620
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:46,060
yeah,

2621
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:48,440
I'd rather be the guy that talks
about it then the guy that actually

2622
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:50,510
demonstrates it and gets the laugh.

2623
01:10:50,511 --> 01:10:51,560
Cause then if I talk about it,

2624
01:10:51,561 --> 01:10:52,211
people like us not,

2625
01:10:52,211 --> 01:10:52,700
it's funny.

2626
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:52,851
Yeah.

2627
01:10:52,851 --> 01:10:56,420
Isn't that a weird thing where people
get trapped in that stunk guide thing?

2628
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:59,540
Like there's a lot of those stunt
guys that are on radio shows.

2629
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:03,200
Like there was a radio show that I did
where they made this guy dress up like a

2630
01:11:03,201 --> 01:11:06,410
cow and it's rollerskate
and jump over a chair.

2631
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:09,130
And if he didn't jump over that
he didn't make over the chairs.

2632
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:10,100
So they had to punish them.

2633
01:11:10,430 --> 01:11:10,881
And so,

2634
01:11:10,881 --> 01:11:11,260
uh,

2635
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:11,480
like,

2636
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,201
and he was like,

2637
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:13,100
you just,

2638
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,990
whatever punishment they
had and the punishment was,

2639
01:11:15,991 --> 01:11:16,190
uh,

2640
01:11:16,190 --> 01:11:16,481
I,

2641
01:11:16,481 --> 01:11:17,850
I choked him unconscious.

2642
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:18,600
Oh God.

2643
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:19,141
And I go,

2644
01:11:19,141 --> 01:11:20,190
you sure you want to do this?

2645
01:11:20,191 --> 01:11:20,461
He's like,

2646
01:11:20,461 --> 01:11:21,660
I got to do whatever they tell me to do.

2647
01:11:21,661 --> 01:11:21,871
I go,

2648
01:11:21,871 --> 01:11:22,500
really?

2649
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,580
It was like so weird.

2650
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:23,971
I was like,

2651
01:11:23,971 --> 01:11:25,590
this is a local radio show.

2652
01:11:25,591 --> 01:11:26,090
Like,

2653
01:11:26,090 --> 01:11:27,480
like you really have to do this.

2654
01:11:27,481 --> 01:11:28,314
But he was like,

2655
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:32,850
like he was like a slave like
in sort of like we'll do,

2656
01:11:32,851 --> 01:11:33,270
I will do it.

2657
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:34,350
Master tells me to,

2658
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:35,790
I will do what they tell me to do.

2659
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:40,860
So I choke them unconscious a slave
for the recognition of the radio.

2660
01:11:40,861 --> 01:11:43,020
She just sat there and I
put my arms around and I go,

2661
01:11:43,021 --> 01:11:44,490
well let me know when
you're gonna tap out.

2662
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:45,271
Like if you have,

2663
01:11:45,271 --> 01:11:45,960
you can't take it anymore,

2664
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,130
just tap out and I'll let you go.

2665
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:47,881
You Ready?

2666
01:11:47,881 --> 01:11:48,211
And he's like,

2667
01:11:48,211 --> 01:11:48,371
yeah.

2668
01:11:48,371 --> 01:11:50,010
And I just squeeze them out.

2669
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:50,881
And the weird thing is,

2670
01:11:50,881 --> 01:11:52,500
good luck doing that on
a regular radio again.

2671
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:53,201
That's probably a while,

2672
01:11:53,201 --> 01:11:53,670
dude.

2673
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:54,540
No Way.

2674
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:55,430
One lawsuit,

2675
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,600
one person dies drinking water.

2676
01:11:57,601 --> 01:11:57,781
You know,

2677
01:11:57,781 --> 01:12:00,060
you're lucky you get a fucking a bottle
of water in the studio now cause they

2678
01:12:00,061 --> 01:12:00,630
all panic.

2679
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:03,600
Can you let in some guy
collapsed your fucking wind pipe?

2680
01:12:03,601 --> 01:12:03,991
You know,

2681
01:12:03,991 --> 01:12:05,280
like I know how to do it,

2682
01:12:05,281 --> 01:12:06,390
but what if I didn't know how to do it?

2683
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:08,190
What if I heard them and you know,

2684
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:11,070
you the UFC sent out a
memo or they told us,

2685
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:11,870
I forgot what it was.

2686
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:12,101
Well,

2687
01:12:12,101 --> 01:12:14,310
there's official or nonofficial
with a few years back,

2688
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:19,260
two people got sued for taking photos
with people where they were choking him in

2689
01:12:19,261 --> 01:12:20,330
the picture as a joke.

2690
01:12:20,331 --> 01:12:20,760
Oh my.

2691
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:23,340
Matt Hughes got sued and
Chuck Ladell got sued.

2692
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:25,320
Both frivolous lawsuits.

2693
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:26,160
Where a guy,

2694
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,050
I get it all the time,

2695
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,190
guys either say,

2696
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:30,960
can I choke you out in a picture?

2697
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,010
Which I say no.

2698
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:32,881
And then they say,

2699
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:33,001
well,

2700
01:12:33,001 --> 01:12:34,410
can you choke me out in the picture?

2701
01:12:34,530 --> 01:12:36,030
Like one of those two always comes up.

2702
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:36,991
Yeah.

2703
01:12:36,991 --> 01:12:37,824
And the uh,

2704
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:38,400
what,

2705
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,820
what that but that to me like
what a piece of shit move that is?

2706
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:41,921
Well,

2707
01:12:41,921 --> 01:12:43,170
one of the guys was a bad cop.

2708
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:44,251
One of the guys that,

2709
01:12:44,251 --> 01:12:45,180
the Matt Hughes Guy,

2710
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:46,350
they investigated him,

2711
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:49,470
turned out the dude was like
doing something drug related,

2712
01:12:49,471 --> 01:12:50,300
something dirty,

2713
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:51,150
wound up going to jail.

2714
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:51,901
I'll really,

2715
01:12:51,901 --> 01:12:52,440
yeah,

2716
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:53,730
because of that,

2717
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:57,510
because of the investigation
that started from him suing Matt.

2718
01:12:57,511 --> 01:12:57,960
He goes,

2719
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:58,470
Matt Hughes,

2720
01:12:58,470 --> 01:12:58,711
you know,

2721
01:12:58,711 --> 01:12:59,221
the guy says,

2722
01:12:59,221 --> 01:12:59,521
let me,

2723
01:12:59,521 --> 01:13:00,000
uh,

2724
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,990
we take a picture of choking me.

2725
01:13:00,991 --> 01:13:03,650
So he's choking the guy and the guy's
going to like that and takes a picture

2726
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:05,100
that it takes that photograph and says,

2727
01:13:05,101 --> 01:13:05,580
Hey,

2728
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:06,690
Matt Hughes choked me.

2729
01:13:06,691 --> 01:13:07,890
I want to get some money.

2730
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,233
Same thing with chuck.

2731
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:10,440
I think chuck actually wound up,

2732
01:13:10,650 --> 01:13:11,730
I don't know if you want to paint him,

2733
01:13:11,731 --> 01:13:12,301
but there was a,

2734
01:13:12,301 --> 01:13:13,470
it was a real situation.

2735
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,100
I always asked him,

2736
01:13:15,101 --> 01:13:15,960
his guys to do things.

2737
01:13:15,961 --> 01:13:17,880
I haven't done it in a while
whenever they're in studio,

2738
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:18,871
but it was on video,

2739
01:13:18,871 --> 01:13:20,490
so there was the context of me asking,

2740
01:13:20,491 --> 01:13:21,300
I guess.

2741
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:21,601
No,

2742
01:13:21,601 --> 01:13:22,830
it was obvious it was a,

2743
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:23,120
and it would,

2744
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,780
and you tapped out and it was like,

2745
01:13:24,781 --> 01:13:25,770
I just want to feel it,

2746
01:13:25,771 --> 01:13:26,140
you know?

2747
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:26,720
Yeah,

2748
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:26,940
yeah.

2749
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:31,020
You did it with fade or I've had
fatal or has choked me and punch me.

2750
01:13:31,021 --> 01:13:35,070
He enjoyed it because he punched me hard
and then he was choking me and I was

2751
01:13:35,071 --> 01:13:35,161
like,

2752
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:35,401
all right,

2753
01:13:35,401 --> 01:13:35,701
I tap,

2754
01:13:35,701 --> 01:13:35,851
tap,

2755
01:13:35,851 --> 01:13:36,031
tap.

2756
01:13:36,031 --> 01:13:38,130
And he did it again and he
smiled and he did it again.

2757
01:13:38,131 --> 01:13:39,030
Like he's a fucking,

2758
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:40,920
he's a really brutal Russian.

2759
01:13:40,921 --> 01:13:41,510
Yeah.

2760
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:41,890
Uh,

2761
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:43,950
the Alaska is choked me.

2762
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:46,780
I think it was a gay
teen choke standing 18,

2763
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,490
I think.

2764
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:48,090
Uh,

2765
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:49,260
brutal.

2766
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,280
I mean,

2767
01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:52,410
Rhonda fucking arm barred me.

2768
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:53,633
Um,

2769
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:54,840
I never did anything with Lidl.

2770
01:13:54,841 --> 01:13:57,660
Rampage funny cause they
were before Silva kicked me.

2771
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:58,350
Ah,

2772
01:13:58,350 --> 01:13:59,670
Jon Jones hurt me the worst.

2773
01:13:59,671 --> 01:14:00,241
He fucking,

2774
01:14:00,241 --> 01:14:02,780
John Jones put his knee in my uh,

2775
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:03,120
heat.

2776
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:03,751
Jon Jones,

2777
01:14:03,751 --> 01:14:04,130
his thing,

2778
01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:06,300
he's punched me before
chuck me fucking Uriah.

2779
01:14:06,301 --> 01:14:07,620
Maybe it's stopped.

2780
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:08,473
They've all injured me.

2781
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:11,650
Jon Jones putting that fucking Shin

2782
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:15,120
in my thigh like a or,

2783
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:16,090
or a need of the thought.

2784
01:14:16,091 --> 01:14:16,924
Whatever he did,

2785
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:19,720
it hurts so badly.

2786
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:21,220
I almost vomited on the floor.

2787
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:23,470
Who's Randy couture did it too.

2788
01:14:23,471 --> 01:14:24,304
Yeah.

2789
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:32,000
And sound.

2790
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:36,010
Patrice was in studio that
day and he said to Randy,

2791
01:14:36,011 --> 01:14:39,220
pretend use the same technique you
would use if you were choking out a clam

2792
01:14:42,130 --> 01:14:42,970
clam.

2793
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:43,421
Yeah,

2794
01:14:43,421 --> 01:14:44,380
you really smashed me.

2795
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:45,281
But,

2796
01:14:45,281 --> 01:14:45,700
uh,

2797
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:48,280
there was one a year
Jones hitting me with the,

2798
01:14:48,281 --> 01:14:49,114
uh,

2799
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:49,410
the,

2800
01:14:49,410 --> 01:14:51,880
that's the one right there
where he's choking me now.

2801
01:14:53,090 --> 01:14:53,471
All right.

2802
01:14:53,471 --> 01:14:53,980
You Ready?

2803
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:54,281
Okay.

2804
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:54,740
Here.

2805
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:55,031
All right.

2806
01:14:55,031 --> 01:14:55,864
Here we go.

2807
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:00,010
That's something else too.

2808
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:01,290
We're looking at fats,

2809
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:01,630
Ohio.

2810
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:06,630
He does something else where he
puts his shin in my fucking leg.

2811
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:08,710
Did he kick you or did he just,

2812
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:10,840
it was kind of like a,

2813
01:15:10,841 --> 01:15:11,351
I don't know.

2814
01:15:11,351 --> 01:15:12,840
You'll know if we can fast forward to it.

2815
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:14,140
You'll know what it is if you see it.

2816
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:17,440
It was so shocking to my system.

2817
01:15:17,441 --> 01:15:18,940
I almost threw up on the console.

2818
01:15:18,941 --> 01:15:19,271
It was,

2819
01:15:19,271 --> 01:15:19,720
it was a,

2820
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:20,441
I almost fainted.

2821
01:15:20,441 --> 01:15:22,690
I actually walked out of the fuck.

2822
01:15:22,691 --> 01:15:24,680
That's five different times
I went to the bathroom,

2823
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:25,780
threw water on my face.

2824
01:15:25,890 --> 01:15:26,290
Whoa.

2825
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:26,980
Because it was like,

2826
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:28,650
it was like my whole system overloaded,

2827
01:15:28,651 --> 01:15:28,990
like,

2828
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:29,621
and he bullied me.

2829
01:15:29,621 --> 01:15:30,220
He could've,

2830
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:30,491
it was,

2831
01:15:30,491 --> 01:15:30,671
you know,

2832
01:15:30,671 --> 01:15:32,080
it was 20% of his strength.

2833
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:32,411
Yeah.

2834
01:15:32,411 --> 01:15:32,920
If that,

2835
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:33,181
but he was,

2836
01:15:33,181 --> 01:15:34,014
it was fight week.

2837
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:36,640
Never do that shit there and fight with a,

2838
01:15:36,641 --> 01:15:39,760
they're ornery and be there
in fucking combat mode.

2839
01:15:39,761 --> 01:15:41,060
That was a dumb time to do it.

2840
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:44,050
Like you know the first sit right here.

2841
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:47,560
I don't want to be
combative with my hands.

2842
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:47,850
That's,

2843
01:15:47,850 --> 01:15:48,683
that sounds good

2844
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:52,840
right here.

2845
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:53,673
Yeah.

2846
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:54,430
Okay.

2847
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:55,010
No,

2848
01:15:55,010 --> 01:15:58,600
that's good to hear you.

2849
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:04,453
Yeah.

2850
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:07,850
Chantal leg kick.

2851
01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:08,723
Yeah.

2852
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:12,990
That was essentially the weight of his
Shin and his leg and he puts something

2853
01:16:12,991 --> 01:16:13,351
into it,

2854
01:16:13,351 --> 01:16:16,920
but not enough to do
any type of real damage.

2855
01:16:16,921 --> 01:16:18,330
It was just where it was.

2856
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,790
I couldn't believe I reacted that way.

2857
01:16:20,791 --> 01:16:21,720
Like my system was like,

2858
01:16:21,721 --> 01:16:22,441
you'll get lightheaded,

2859
01:16:22,441 --> 01:16:23,221
tingly feeling.

2860
01:16:23,221 --> 01:16:23,700
You get like,

2861
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:24,181
I'm going to vomit,

2862
01:16:24,181 --> 01:16:25,014
I'm going to vomit.

2863
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:25,651
And then I was like,

2864
01:16:25,651 --> 01:16:26,490
I'm going to pass out.

2865
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:27,360
I had to go to the bathroom,

2866
01:16:27,361 --> 01:16:28,410
put water on my face,

2867
01:16:28,411 --> 01:16:30,510
like a fucking like an old lady.

2868
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:31,231
But that's a,

2869
01:16:31,231 --> 01:16:32,940
that's a really painful technique.

2870
01:16:32,970 --> 01:16:33,803
This is certainly is.

2871
01:16:33,810 --> 01:16:34,380
It doesn't,

2872
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:36,360
it's a weird thing because those guys,

2873
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:40,050
they're so used to fighting off of
pain and dealing with the pain and the

2874
01:16:40,051 --> 01:16:43,710
adrenaline of the fight that a lot of
people underestimate the impact of leg

2875
01:16:43,711 --> 01:16:44,280
kicks.

2876
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:44,660
I've,

2877
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:45,451
I've learned like,

2878
01:16:45,451 --> 01:16:45,720
you know,

2879
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:46,470
everyone knows you have,

2880
01:16:46,470 --> 01:16:48,330
see hearts in mixed
martial arts is painful,

2881
01:16:48,510 --> 01:16:49,830
but after doing that I've been like,

2882
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:52,340
it makes you watch the sport differently.

2883
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:53,040
Like,

2884
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:53,701
like to watch,

2885
01:16:53,701 --> 01:16:54,301
like I'll watch it.

2886
01:16:54,301 --> 01:16:54,510
I,

2887
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:56,700
my favorite fighters are
those fucking Brazilian,

2888
01:16:56,701 --> 01:16:58,230
like you know those leg kickers,

2889
01:16:58,231 --> 01:16:58,421
man.

2890
01:16:58,421 --> 01:17:01,950
I know it's fucking Josie aldose or
by both of those guys that are like,

2891
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:03,370
we like flaps.

2892
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:03,810
Oh yeah.

2893
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:05,610
Because after experiencing that,

2894
01:17:05,611 --> 01:17:09,120
I'm like the fact that guy can stand
there and still fight after having his leg

2895
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:10,010
like that,

2896
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:13,070
it never ceases to amaze me that they
don't immediately collapsed and just go

2897
01:17:13,071 --> 01:17:13,430
home.

2898
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:13,641
Well,

2899
01:17:13,641 --> 01:17:16,460
they don't feel it as much because
of the adrenaline of the fight,

2900
01:17:16,461 --> 01:17:19,100
but it is unbelievably painful
even with the adrenaline.

2901
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:20,240
And then after it's over.

2902
01:17:20,241 --> 01:17:24,730
Like did you have ever received a Uriah
where his whole leg after he fought Aldo

2903
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:27,170
was swollen to twice the
size of his other leg.

2904
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:30,110
He took all these photos of
it and posted them on Twitter.

2905
01:17:30,111 --> 01:17:31,400
Like as it was healing,

2906
01:17:31,401 --> 01:17:34,010
it was just a giant purple sausage.

2907
01:17:34,011 --> 01:17:35,000
It was crazy.

2908
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:37,550
Or you see the leg kicks that
knocked the guy's leg back.

2909
01:17:37,551 --> 01:17:38,960
Like when the guy
standing on that leg kick.

2910
01:17:38,961 --> 01:17:39,590
That's sweet.

2911
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:42,530
Like if you kick a guy's leg hard enough
to sweep it back where he's almost off

2912
01:17:42,531 --> 01:17:42,891
balance.

2913
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:43,340
Like man,

2914
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:46,940
that's a really hard how chihuahua
kick and when still the kicked me,

2915
01:17:46,941 --> 01:17:50,270
I kept trying to get in to kick a little
harder because he was going so gently.

2916
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:51,080
He's a nice guy.

2917
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,390
He's a very nice and okay.

2918
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:52,550
Yeah,

2919
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:55,370
he's such a meek like pleasant
fellow a and then he just,

2920
01:17:55,380 --> 01:18:00,350
he kicked me slightly harder and it just
jarred my head when he kicked me in the

2921
01:18:00,351 --> 01:18:04,490
arm and I had a headache for two hours
because of my head jarred and I wasn't

2922
01:18:04,491 --> 01:18:04,970
ready for,

2923
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:05,390
you know.

2924
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:05,781
Yeah.

2925
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:06,501
Well that's you know,

2926
01:18:06,501 --> 01:18:08,930
one of the places where
concussions take place,

2927
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:11,630
like everyone thinks a concussion
is when you get hit in the head,

2928
01:18:11,870 --> 01:18:14,900
but there's doctors explained it to
me that a concussion is anything that

2929
01:18:14,901 --> 01:18:16,250
happens from your chest up.

2930
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:19,910
Like you can get like hit
really hard in a football match.

2931
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:23,990
You can get hit really hard like in
the chest and the game and you get a

2932
01:18:23,991 --> 01:18:28,991
concussion because the impact that makes
your head around your brain sloshes

2933
01:18:29,181 --> 01:18:32,300
around inside your skull and you get a
concussion from that so you don't even

2934
01:18:32,301 --> 01:18:33,530
have to get hit in the head.

2935
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:34,543
They get a concussion.

2936
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:34,860
Yeah,

2937
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:35,410
it's,

2938
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:38,450
it's every one of those moves hurt a lot.

2939
01:18:38,451 --> 01:18:41,580
And when you feel the grip that a guy
like that puts on you like again like a

2940
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:42,950
cane is a fucking monster,

2941
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:45,220
but any anyone who puts a
grip on you and it's like it,

2942
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:49,310
it is simply an unbreakable situation.

2943
01:18:49,311 --> 01:18:54,311
I'm in like I am only alive and not fucked
in the ass because he's choosing not

2944
01:18:54,321 --> 01:18:55,280
to do those things.

2945
01:18:55,610 --> 01:18:57,110
It's a really weird feeling to be.

2946
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:00,770
It makes you like maybe the older you get,

2947
01:19:00,771 --> 01:19:01,640
the more aware you are,

2948
01:19:01,641 --> 01:19:02,990
the bad shit can happen.

2949
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:05,330
But it makes you very cautious in life.

2950
01:19:05,331 --> 01:19:09,200
Like these are the guys that are walking
around and like you try not to start

2951
01:19:09,201 --> 01:19:12,620
confrontations with people for no reason
cause you don't know who has a pistol.

2952
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:13,521
That woman who was assaulted,

2953
01:19:13,521 --> 01:19:17,780
Anthony had no idea that he's a
guy with a gun and lucky for her,

2954
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,340
he's not a maniac with a gun.

2955
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:20,750
She had talk her on Twitter.

2956
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:24,470
What if he just got a really good leg
kick that when you decided I'm not going

2957
01:19:24,471 --> 01:19:26,060
to punch abroad but while whack.

2958
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:26,953
Yeah.

2959
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:28,311
But then,

2960
01:19:28,311 --> 01:19:30,710
but then they would have said he struck
a woman and then he would have been even

2961
01:19:30,711 --> 01:19:32,570
probably more fuck cause
they're an illegal proceedings.

2962
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:33,231
You know,

2963
01:19:33,231 --> 01:19:37,070
she would have said that this
just showed the gun very illegal.

2964
01:19:37,071 --> 01:19:37,851
Very illegal.

2965
01:19:37,851 --> 01:19:38,660
Yes.

2966
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:39,230
Yes.

2967
01:19:39,230 --> 01:19:40,640
Especially when you look like fucking,

2968
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:41,160
yeah.

2969
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,050
You can't just show it.

2970
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:42,540
Yeah.

2971
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:43,250
It's supposed to do that.

2972
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:43,600
First of all,

2973
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,200
it looks like chef from apocalypse now.

2974
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:46,430
Nobody wanted him to be flashing at.

2975
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:50,750
Joey Cola told me that he was working
at pips and in Brooklyn and some guy in

2976
01:19:50,751 --> 01:19:53,360
the front row was heckling
him and showing him his gun.

2977
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:54,980
He's so fucking busy.

2978
01:19:55,050 --> 01:19:56,660
She fucking piece of shit.

2979
01:19:56,661 --> 01:19:59,120
You fucking terrible saying
all this crazy shit to him.

2980
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,440
And he goes and I'm upset.

2981
01:20:00,441 --> 01:20:01,340
I just gotta keep going.

2982
01:20:01,341 --> 01:20:02,174
My jokes,

2983
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:03,440
I'm update telling my jokes,

2984
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:03,831
you know,

2985
01:20:03,831 --> 01:20:04,520
Joey Cola,

2986
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,710
nicest guy in the world and he's,

2987
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:07,980
he's onstage and

2988
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:09,540
this guy keeps brandishing.

2989
01:20:09,541 --> 01:20:12,120
It got his pips even around
anymore for signing around anymore.

2990
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:13,160
I just talked to a guy the other night,

2991
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:14,290
he used to own pibs I forget.

2992
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:14,491
He's like,

2993
01:20:14,491 --> 01:20:14,591
yeah,

2994
01:20:14,591 --> 01:20:15,630
we always trying to get you in there.

2995
01:20:15,631 --> 01:20:15,751
I,

2996
01:20:15,751 --> 01:20:17,130
I did it when the Shults has had it.

2997
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:18,660
And then I think Ray Garvey,

2998
01:20:18,661 --> 01:20:20,040
we took over and read ray died.

2999
01:20:20,041 --> 01:20:21,180
He had stomach cancer.

3000
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:22,290
Did you know ray or no,

3001
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:23,213
I never worked there.

3002
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:24,510
I did a few spots there.

3003
01:20:24,511 --> 01:20:25,350
I never worked there either.

3004
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,830
I probably went there with
auto one time and you know,

3005
01:20:27,831 --> 01:20:30,750
or would it be because dice was already
long gone dice used to do that place.

3006
01:20:30,751 --> 01:20:32,220
A lot of ways from Dangerfield,

3007
01:20:32,221 --> 01:20:33,120
all those guys from pips.

3008
01:20:33,390 --> 01:20:33,900
But uh,

3009
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:35,010
George Schultz had it.

3010
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:36,420
Seth Schultz,

3011
01:20:36,450 --> 01:20:37,283
um,

3012
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:38,240
you know,

3013
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:39,490
I know when Marty and,

3014
01:20:39,491 --> 01:20:39,591
uh,

3015
01:20:39,591 --> 01:20:41,040
I think Marnie and Seth
had it when I did it.

3016
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:42,540
Dangerfield still around.

3017
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:43,950
It is still going strong.

3018
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:45,450
I haven't done it in a long time.

3019
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:46,471
I used to do that,

3020
01:20:46,471 --> 01:20:48,180
that that was one of the ones
that helped me work on my,

3021
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:52,170
my shit because you got 25 minutes to
go up and I would put some notes on the

3022
01:20:52,171 --> 01:20:52,980
piano.

3023
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:54,150
There's that black piano,

3024
01:20:54,151 --> 01:20:54,720
it's a block.

3025
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:58,230
It reminds me of the comedy store and
you'd go up and there's a history there

3026
01:20:58,231 --> 01:20:59,130
and just do your shit.

3027
01:20:59,610 --> 01:21:00,430
And um,

3028
01:21:00,430 --> 01:21:02,790
I worked out a lot of fucking material.

3029
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:05,940
I paid my rent when I lived with
Jim Florentine in North Jersey.

3030
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:08,520
I would do seven spots on a Saturday,

3031
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:10,380
a Saturday and six on a Friday.

3032
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:11,610
And I would do Dangerfield,

3033
01:21:11,611 --> 01:21:12,460
seller Dangerfield,

3034
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,420
seller from fucking first avenue
and 60th to western and Mcdougal.

3035
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:17,130
And I drove out of the park,

3036
01:21:17,131 --> 01:21:18,870
my stupid fucking Saturn.

3037
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:19,531
And uh,

3038
01:21:19,531 --> 01:21:19,771
you,

3039
01:21:19,771 --> 01:21:20,940
you knew where to park and you know,

3040
01:21:20,941 --> 01:21:22,650
it was a whole system I got into,

3041
01:21:22,651 --> 01:21:25,200
but danger fields really
helped me develop as a comic.

3042
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:26,610
Did she ever do the Prom shows there?

3043
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:27,121
Yes I did.

3044
01:21:27,121 --> 01:21:27,954
They're horrible.

3045
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,310
But you were making 75 is set.

3046
01:21:29,311 --> 01:21:29,630
And I was like,

3047
01:21:29,630 --> 01:21:30,463
okay.

3048
01:21:30,490 --> 01:21:31,650
And you did a lot of sets.

3049
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:32,431
How many cents?

3050
01:21:32,431 --> 01:21:33,264
What we do at night.

3051
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:34,530
Sometimes you do,

3052
01:21:34,531 --> 01:21:36,450
it depends on how many fucking awful,

3053
01:21:36,510 --> 01:21:36,900
uh,

3054
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:37,830
teenagers were coming in.

3055
01:21:37,831 --> 01:21:39,870
But sometimes it'd be
three or four a night.

3056
01:21:39,871 --> 01:21:43,710
You can make an extra 300 bucks
or sometimes just one way.

3057
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:45,960
One of the most painful
promise shows ever is,

3058
01:21:45,961 --> 01:21:50,760
I did Caroline's years ago and I did a
pro set and Willie Tyler and Leicester

3059
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:52,770
were on the show and you know,

3060
01:21:52,771 --> 01:21:53,491
I knew them from,

3061
01:21:53,491 --> 01:21:53,761
you know,

3062
01:21:53,761 --> 01:21:56,110
solid goals to shows it very nice guy.

3063
01:21:56,180 --> 01:21:56,460
I had a,

3064
01:21:56,460 --> 01:22:00,960
one of the best ventriloquists ever and
he's on stage and it was just not for

3065
01:22:00,961 --> 01:22:01,860
the kids and material,

3066
01:22:01,861 --> 01:22:02,041
you know,

3067
01:22:02,041 --> 01:22:03,110
it was a little like he's,

3068
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:07,740
and he's doing some song and I believe
I can fly and on the fucking puppet sing

3069
01:22:07,741 --> 01:22:10,380
and it's a fun song and
these kids from the Bronx,

3070
01:22:10,381 --> 01:22:12,180
we're just not enjoying it.

3071
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:14,670
It was ugly fly home motherfucker,

3072
01:22:14,671 --> 01:22:15,350
you suck.

3073
01:22:15,350 --> 01:22:15,691
Oh,

3074
01:22:15,691 --> 01:22:17,250
it was horrible.

3075
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:22,460
I've net and he smiled and kept it
professional and didn't acknowledge any of

3076
01:22:22,861 --> 01:22:22,960
it.

3077
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,870
He that talked about take
your money and get out.

3078
01:22:24,871 --> 01:22:25,470
That's what he did.

3079
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:26,550
Do you remember Al Lubell?

3080
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:26,941
Sure I do.

3081
01:22:26,941 --> 01:22:27,600
I live well.

3082
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:28,050
I live well.

3083
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:29,100
I need a giant cock.

3084
01:22:29,130 --> 01:22:30,180
That's what I remember about Al Labelle.

3085
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:31,350
I've heard he had a big cock.

3086
01:22:31,351 --> 01:22:31,670
Yeah.

3087
01:22:31,670 --> 01:22:32,940
Al Lubell was on stage.

3088
01:22:32,941 --> 01:22:33,810
We're doing prom shows,

3089
01:22:33,811 --> 01:22:37,110
a danger fields and a kid got
onstage is big football player.

3090
01:22:37,111 --> 01:22:39,360
Kid came onstage,

3091
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:41,850
took the microphone from
Bell and Blue Cigar,

3092
01:22:41,851 --> 01:22:42,870
smoke in his face,

3093
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:46,600
had a cigar and he was standing on on
stage and all his friends were cheering

3094
01:22:46,770 --> 01:22:48,030
and no one did anything about it.

3095
01:22:48,031 --> 01:22:48,451
And I was like,

3096
01:22:48,451 --> 01:22:49,290
wow,

3097
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:50,340
that's why I stopped working there.

3098
01:22:50,610 --> 01:22:51,900
Not because it didn't happen to me,

3099
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:52,890
but they wouldn't.

3100
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:54,000
I didn't feel they took,

3101
01:22:54,180 --> 01:22:57,090
they didn't protect the
comics enough from hecklers.

3102
01:22:57,091 --> 01:22:58,020
Like they would never call,

3103
01:22:58,110 --> 01:22:59,670
throw people out and that's
why I stopped working there.

3104
01:22:59,700 --> 01:22:59,791
Well,

3105
01:22:59,791 --> 01:23:01,590
it's very much like the
comedy store in that way.

3106
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:05,070
Both old sort of dark places
in both with no crowd control.

3107
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:06,100
They had

3108
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:06,821
one guy.

3109
01:23:06,821 --> 01:23:08,070
Do you remember Bobby all?

3110
01:23:08,110 --> 01:23:10,150
I met Bobby one time.

3111
01:23:10,210 --> 01:23:11,590
Bobby would take care of shit.

3112
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:12,730
I worked with Bobby a lot.

3113
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:17,620
He was a Scottish guy who was about
five foot eight wide and five foot eight

3114
01:23:17,621 --> 01:23:18,280
tall.

3115
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:20,050
He was a fucking tank,

3116
01:23:20,051 --> 01:23:20,411
this guy,

3117
01:23:20,411 --> 01:23:21,050
but he wasn't fat.

3118
01:23:21,050 --> 01:23:21,160
Right.

3119
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:21,431
He was like,

3120
01:23:21,431 --> 01:23:21,850
oh,

3121
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:22,041
well,

3122
01:23:22,041 --> 01:23:22,421
you know,

3123
01:23:22,421 --> 01:23:23,920
he wasn't the skinniest guy in the world,

3124
01:23:23,921 --> 01:23:28,921
but he was a power lifter and he was
strong as fuck and something happened.

3125
01:23:29,141 --> 01:23:30,190
I forgot what it was,

3126
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:33,130
but I saw him pick a guy up by his neck.

3127
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:37,510
He literally grabbed this guy by the
back of his neck and picked him up like a

3128
01:23:37,511 --> 01:23:38,344
kitten.

3129
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:40,420
Like he had his hand on this guy's neck,

3130
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:41,920
hoisted him up out of his chair,

3131
01:23:41,921 --> 01:23:44,140
grabbed his belt and
just carried them out.

3132
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:45,940
And the guy just went limp,

3133
01:23:46,150 --> 01:23:48,010
like feeling how strong Bobby was.

3134
01:23:48,011 --> 01:23:48,491
He's just like,

3135
01:23:48,491 --> 01:23:49,480
fuck this.

3136
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:52,810
He just completely went limp and Bobby
carried him outside and tossed them.

3137
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,231
Yeah,

3138
01:23:53,231 --> 01:23:54,220
he's a legendary guy.

3139
01:23:54,221 --> 01:23:54,770
Bobby.

3140
01:23:54,770 --> 01:23:55,600
Uh,

3141
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:56,500
everyone loved him.

3142
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:57,520
Whatever happened to that guy.

3143
01:23:57,540 --> 01:23:58,280
He died.

3144
01:23:58,280 --> 01:23:58,910
Oh,

3145
01:23:58,910 --> 01:23:59,711
he's got a long time ago.

3146
01:23:59,711 --> 01:23:59,831
Yeah,

3147
01:23:59,831 --> 01:24:00,664
he died many years ago,

3148
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:01,370
I think.

3149
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:02,860
I don't know,

3150
01:24:02,861 --> 01:24:03,550
actually.

3151
01:24:03,550 --> 01:24:04,061
He was out.

3152
01:24:04,061 --> 01:24:05,980
I think Tony's son Tony,

3153
01:24:05,981 --> 01:24:07,030
who ran it with Rodney,

3154
01:24:07,031 --> 01:24:09,940
his son took over for a while and I
haven't seen his son down in many years

3155
01:24:09,941 --> 01:24:10,151
either,

3156
01:24:10,151 --> 01:24:10,721
but he was the guy.

3157
01:24:10,721 --> 01:24:11,800
I kind of got to know you.

3158
01:24:11,801 --> 01:24:13,740
I knew Darren was Darren and Bobby.

3159
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:15,790
I only met once when I went
in there with somebody.

3160
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:16,001
Oh,

3161
01:24:16,001 --> 01:24:17,180
that sucks that that guy died.

3162
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:17,590
Yeah,

3163
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:17,861
man,

3164
01:24:17,861 --> 01:24:18,311
I heard that.

3165
01:24:18,311 --> 01:24:20,110
I never got to know him
and I kind of wish I did.

3166
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:20,680
He was such

3167
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:21,760
vibrant character.

3168
01:24:21,761 --> 01:24:22,810
I can't believe he died.

3169
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:23,021
Well,

3170
01:24:23,021 --> 01:24:24,190
I know him and the kid,

3171
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:25,660
him and Darren had a falling out.

3172
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:25,920
Right.

3173
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:26,271
The kid,

3174
01:24:26,271 --> 01:24:26,430
right.

3175
01:24:26,430 --> 01:24:27,061
That was what he called it,

3176
01:24:27,061 --> 01:24:27,260
right?

3177
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:27,840
Yeah.

3178
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:28,673
The Kid,

3179
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:30,030
the bug of Shite.

3180
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:31,441
Everything was up.

3181
01:24:31,441 --> 01:24:32,000
I got shaken.

3182
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:32,221
I know.

3183
01:24:32,221 --> 01:24:32,821
Talent back.

3184
01:24:32,821 --> 01:24:35,040
I shake it up there that
you're tricked them again.

3185
01:24:35,050 --> 01:24:35,800
The Rogan,

3186
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:36,900
like every time we go home,

3187
01:24:36,930 --> 01:24:38,160
if I had a good laughs,

3188
01:24:38,190 --> 01:24:38,611
he would say,

3189
01:24:38,611 --> 01:24:38,791
oh,

3190
01:24:38,791 --> 01:24:39,624
you tricked them again.

3191
01:24:39,710 --> 01:24:42,710
Good comedians say there's funnier
than any of the comics too.

3192
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:43,580
It's very funny.

3193
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:44,151
He was very,

3194
01:24:44,151 --> 01:24:44,691
very funny.

3195
01:24:44,691 --> 01:24:45,770
He was a hilarious guy.

3196
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:47,540
I enjoyed that guy very much.

3197
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:49,340
I would go there and looking
forward to seeing them.

3198
01:24:49,610 --> 01:24:51,650
I'm bummed that I never got to work.

3199
01:24:51,651 --> 01:24:53,750
The old catch either with
Louis friend who was there.

3200
01:24:53,990 --> 01:24:55,130
I went in there a couple of times.

3201
01:24:55,131 --> 01:24:56,300
I might have done one set there,

3202
01:24:56,301 --> 01:24:57,140
but I never worked there.

3203
01:24:57,141 --> 01:24:58,370
The catch on Second Avenue,

3204
01:24:58,730 --> 01:25:00,260
this is my first set I
ever did in New York.

3205
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:01,191
Yeah,

3206
01:25:01,191 --> 01:25:01,491
I did.

3207
01:25:01,491 --> 01:25:03,200
When I was auditioning for Sossman,

3208
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:04,800
I did some sets in Boston.

3209
01:25:04,801 --> 01:25:05,301
Then he outed me,

3210
01:25:05,301 --> 01:25:08,270
come out to New York and audition out
there in the first set I ever did in New

3211
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:08,271
York.

3212
01:25:08,271 --> 01:25:13,271
I was fucking terrified out of my mind
was that catch I w I got there early.

3213
01:25:13,371 --> 01:25:14,570
I drove down from Boston,

3214
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:17,210
wandered around the
neighborhood shitting my pants,

3215
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:18,073
terrified.

3216
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:18,681
I just,

3217
01:25:18,681 --> 01:25:22,520
I always had this thing in my head about
doing standup in New York for whatever

3218
01:25:22,521 --> 01:25:23,180
reason.

3219
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:24,830
I just thought that New York was harder.

3220
01:25:24,831 --> 01:25:26,030
The people were smarter.

3221
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:26,961
When I got on stage,

3222
01:25:26,961 --> 01:25:28,700
I realized they were just people you know,

3223
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:29,260
but the,

3224
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:30,680
but up until that moment,

3225
01:25:30,681 --> 01:25:31,250
I was like,

3226
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:32,660
they're living in the city.

3227
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:34,700
These are people that live in this city.

3228
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:35,221
You know,

3229
01:25:35,221 --> 01:25:37,550
in New York City it has this air about it.

3230
01:25:37,551 --> 01:25:38,990
This is very intimidating air

3231
01:25:39,470 --> 01:25:40,011
because you know,

3232
01:25:40,011 --> 01:25:40,820
comedians,

3233
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:42,590
they think like while
New York's a big city,

3234
01:25:42,591 --> 01:25:46,600
if you worked at your s there's this
illusion or this diluted nature,

3235
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:47,211
you'll have the people,

3236
01:25:47,211 --> 01:25:48,500
the communities in New York are smarter.

3237
01:25:48,830 --> 01:25:49,551
Some of them are like,

3238
01:25:49,551 --> 01:25:49,701
you know,

3239
01:25:49,701 --> 01:25:50,421
you get a talent,

3240
01:25:50,421 --> 01:25:52,370
Collin who are geniuses and they get,

3241
01:25:52,371 --> 01:25:54,500
but you have plenty of Shitty Haqqanis,

3242
01:25:54,890 --> 01:25:56,450
plenty of dumb audiences.

3243
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:57,530
Plenty of fucking,

3244
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:01,490
I mean the comedy cellar is my home and
it's my favorite place in the world and

3245
01:26:01,491 --> 01:26:02,840
you'll still have a bachelorette party.

3246
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:04,130
I was on stage

3247
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:05,390
maybe a few months ago,

3248
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,160
killing on a Saturday.

3249
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:11,540
Like really one of those sets that you
just fucking hammering and right before I

3250
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:16,160
get off these fucking middle age
bachelorettes one of them go say something

3251
01:26:16,161 --> 01:26:17,270
funny.

3252
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:19,940
It's just a matter where you are.

3253
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:21,980
No matter how good your show is,

3254
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,550
you know there's always that element.

3255
01:26:25,551 --> 01:26:26,450
Thank God I was killing.

3256
01:26:26,451 --> 01:26:27,620
I really brutalized her.

3257
01:26:27,621 --> 01:26:29,870
It was all I couldn't,

3258
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:32,000
I couldn't have said cunt faster.

3259
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:33,290
If I had been,

3260
01:26:33,290 --> 01:26:37,100
if I had been programmed to say at that
moment it flew out so naturally and

3261
01:26:37,101 --> 01:26:37,934
beautifully,

3262
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:41,240
which during a bad set is a bad thing
because then the crowd totally agrees with

3263
01:26:41,241 --> 01:26:42,074
the person.

3264
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:43,190
But in that moment that you know,

3265
01:26:43,210 --> 01:26:46,100
is there anything better than calling
someone a cunt and fucking crowd cheers.

3266
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:46,851
Oh yeah.

3267
01:26:46,851 --> 01:26:49,880
The angry Bachelorette party attendance.

3268
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:51,050
Do you record your sets?

3269
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:51,561
I do.

3270
01:26:51,561 --> 01:26:53,300
Everyone I videotape on a little,

3271
01:26:53,301 --> 01:26:54,134
uh,

3272
01:26:54,170 --> 01:26:55,310
on a little lot of Gopro.

3273
01:26:55,530 --> 01:26:56,960
You videotape them all?

3274
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:57,231
Well,

3275
01:26:57,231 --> 01:26:57,620
yeah.

3276
01:26:57,620 --> 01:26:59,720
Just because I'm more
creative when I do that.

3277
01:26:59,721 --> 01:27:03,290
Cause I know like if I want to Improv on
something I will because I'm taping it

3278
01:27:03,291 --> 01:27:04,160
so I know I'll have it.

3279
01:27:05,330 --> 01:27:06,410
I record everything.

3280
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:07,130
Audio,

3281
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:08,360
I just use my iPhone,

3282
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:09,130
I put it on.

3283
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:09,540
Okay,

3284
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:10,331
sure I have all.

3285
01:27:10,331 --> 01:27:12,890
But it is good to see
yourself too and well,

3286
01:27:12,891 --> 01:27:14,390
it's also easier to go forward.

3287
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:16,850
I could zip through it a
little bit easier and uh,

3288
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:17,211
you know,

3289
01:27:17,211 --> 01:27:19,460
we're stuffy or they know
where stuff is and my iPhone,

3290
01:27:19,461 --> 01:27:20,630
like I don't trust that being out.

3291
01:27:20,631 --> 01:27:24,410
That's got to stay in the pocket because
it's just too much shit on there that

3292
01:27:24,411 --> 01:27:28,730
it cannot be lost too many
and explicable photos.

3293
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:31,190
But the NSA has your photos.

3294
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:32,060
Let them have them.

3295
01:27:32,061 --> 01:27:34,490
Then they're not buying tickets to see me.

3296
01:27:34,710 --> 01:27:37,760
You've seen that fucking new revelation
that came out today that Edward Snowden

3297
01:27:37,761 --> 01:27:38,990
was saying that they were passing,

3298
01:27:38,991 --> 01:27:42,800
the NSA guys were passing back
and forth naked photographs.

3299
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:44,750
I heard it got through searches.

3300
01:27:45,290 --> 01:27:48,040
They would also do searches
on their girlfriends and,

3301
01:27:48,041 --> 01:27:48,530
and uh,

3302
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:48,801
you know,

3303
01:27:48,801 --> 01:27:49,730
cause they had access.

3304
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,290
Wow.

3305
01:27:50,290 --> 01:27:50,810
Yeah.

3306
01:27:50,810 --> 01:27:54,380
So they'd find compromising photos and
they would share them with each other.

3307
01:27:54,381 --> 01:27:55,640
They would send them like send this one.

3308
01:27:55,641 --> 01:27:57,910
The Tom and Tom would send
that one to Billy liquid.

3309
01:27:57,980 --> 01:27:58,730
Bobby found,

3310
01:27:58,730 --> 01:27:59,270
you know,

3311
01:27:59,270 --> 01:28:00,830
and these people that
they were investigating,

3312
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:01,191
you know,

3313
01:28:01,191 --> 01:28:02,420
naked terrorist shots,

3314
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:03,040
some chicken,

3315
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,340
a burger with a big hairy beaver.

3316
01:28:04,370 --> 01:28:05,203
Oh really?

3317
01:28:05,370 --> 01:28:06,203
Yeah.

3318
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:06,891
I don't,

3319
01:28:06,891 --> 01:28:07,031
you know,

3320
01:28:07,031 --> 01:28:07,401
it's funny,

3321
01:28:07,401 --> 01:28:09,950
my views on the NSA is as bad as they are.

3322
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:10,910
We at,

3323
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:14,180
that's what we deserve with
a nosiest fucking culture.

3324
01:28:14,450 --> 01:28:15,940
All we do is,

3325
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:17,600
is mind everybody's business.

3326
01:28:17,601 --> 01:28:21,050
There's nothing an American loves
more than a stick off fucking face in

3327
01:28:21,051 --> 01:28:22,190
somebody's privacy.

3328
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:26,120
And it made me so happy when that
shit happened because it was like,

3329
01:28:26,150 --> 01:28:26,451
good,

3330
01:28:26,451 --> 01:28:27,440
you mother fuckers.

3331
01:28:27,570 --> 01:28:31,970
Where were you all of these years
defending people's right to be assholes in

3332
01:28:31,971 --> 01:28:32,570
private.

3333
01:28:32,570 --> 01:28:33,171
We're voyeurs,

3334
01:28:33,171 --> 01:28:33,860
we love it.

3335
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:34,940
And not when it's turned on us,

3336
01:28:34,941 --> 01:28:35,774
we don't like it.

3337
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:39,830
Did you see the newest one about the
British spies manipulating polls?

3338
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:40,431
Yes.

3339
01:28:40,431 --> 01:28:43,280
Online polls and youtube hits and videos.

3340
01:28:43,780 --> 01:28:44,180
Yeah.

3341
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:47,450
I mean it's literally everything that
Alex Jones has been saying for years.

3342
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:48,830
Everybody's been calling him crazy.

3343
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:49,880
He's vindicated.

3344
01:28:50,150 --> 01:28:50,391
I mean,

3345
01:28:50,391 --> 01:28:52,910
he's been saying that
the propaganda machine,

3346
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:53,871
but they're really,

3347
01:28:53,871 --> 01:28:54,351
they are,

3348
01:28:54,351 --> 01:28:58,700
they're using government propaganda
and all sorts of hacking tools.

3349
01:28:58,730 --> 01:29:00,170
It's really a fascinating thing.

3350
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:01,160
A collection of hacking,

3351
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:02,010
some of

3352
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:05,490
which are specifically suited for
spreading disinformation were exposed.

3353
01:29:05,491 --> 01:29:10,491
An elite 2012 document provided by
stolen to the intercept is the online

3354
01:29:10,621 --> 01:29:13,140
publication led by Greg Glenn Greenwald,

3355
01:29:13,141 --> 01:29:13,921
the journalist's blah,

3356
01:29:13,921 --> 01:29:14,071
blah,

3357
01:29:14,071 --> 01:29:14,251
blah,

3358
01:29:14,251 --> 01:29:14,431
blah,

3359
01:29:14,431 --> 01:29:14,611
blah,

3360
01:29:14,611 --> 01:29:14,761
blah,

3361
01:29:14,761 --> 01:29:15,330
blah.

3362
01:29:15,330 --> 01:29:16,350
So I mean,

3363
01:29:16,410 --> 01:29:17,243
they,

3364
01:29:17,370 --> 01:29:17,731
they,

3365
01:29:17,731 --> 01:29:18,001
uh,

3366
01:29:18,001 --> 01:29:18,870
underpass,

3367
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:22,950
a tool that lets government changed
the outcome of online polls.

3368
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:25,140
They can change the
outcome of online polls,

3369
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:26,850
a bomb bay,

3370
01:29:26,851 --> 01:29:31,230
it can increase website hits and rankings
so they can increase website hits,

3371
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:35,960
change online amplifications
of given for propaganda APP,

3372
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,980
amplification of a given message.

3373
01:29:38,130 --> 01:29:41,130
Normally video on a
popular multimedia website,

3374
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:46,140
a gateway which will
artificially increased traffic
to a website slip stream,

3375
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:48,990
which will infiltrate
page views in a website.

3376
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:51,240
So what they could do is
they could put up a website,

3377
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:53,250
make that website looks super popular,

3378
01:29:53,370 --> 01:29:54,690
make it look like it's gone viral.

3379
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:55,631
There's something that,

3380
01:29:55,631 --> 01:29:55,851
that,

3381
01:29:55,851 --> 01:29:57,220
that Alex has not explained there.

3382
01:29:57,221 --> 01:29:58,150
If that's where that's from.

3383
01:29:58,240 --> 01:29:58,461
No,

3384
01:29:58,461 --> 01:29:59,090
it's not.

3385
01:29:59,090 --> 01:30:00,640
It's coming from Snowden.

3386
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:01,211
I did,

3387
01:30:01,211 --> 01:30:02,680
I did a um,

3388
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:04,120
red idea of the night,

3389
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:04,420
uh,

3390
01:30:04,420 --> 01:30:06,040
with even having Mike
Baker on your podcast.

3391
01:30:06,041 --> 01:30:06,940
He use to be in the CIA.

3392
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:07,360
No,

3393
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:08,193
and now he's not.

3394
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:11,050
Mike hates snowed cause he was a CIA guy.

3395
01:30:11,410 --> 01:30:14,350
But he's a really interesting that he
said something about just in passing,

3396
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:18,170
Mike was talking about these websites in
boosting the hits up and he goes dead.

3397
01:30:18,210 --> 01:30:19,240
People don't understand that.

3398
01:30:19,241 --> 01:30:20,740
We really are still engaged in,

3399
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:21,060
in it.

3400
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:21,371
He goes,

3401
01:30:21,371 --> 01:30:23,050
I know it's not popular to
say that there's a bad guy,

3402
01:30:23,051 --> 01:30:23,884
but there is.

3403
01:30:23,950 --> 01:30:24,251
And he goes,

3404
01:30:24,251 --> 01:30:26,140
then you build these
fucking sites and you,

3405
01:30:26,141 --> 01:30:26,470
you know,

3406
01:30:26,470 --> 01:30:28,690
because you billed them cause you
want to develop relationships.

3407
01:30:28,990 --> 01:30:30,160
And that hadn't occurred to me.

3408
01:30:30,370 --> 01:30:33,310
There's certain sites are made to look
more popular that the government is

3409
01:30:33,311 --> 01:30:34,000
running.

3410
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,780
And then the people that come to them
who are actually involved in that type of

3411
01:30:37,781 --> 01:30:38,410
shit,

3412
01:30:38,410 --> 01:30:41,260
you now see who's coming to these sites
and then where they're going and you

3413
01:30:41,261 --> 01:30:44,680
develop relationships with these people
and you get to know them that way.

3414
01:30:45,010 --> 01:30:48,870
And it's not always just
about propaganda and sell.

3415
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,010
A lot of it is stuff that
we'll never find out about,

3416
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:51,701
but he,

3417
01:30:51,701 --> 01:30:51,870
he,

3418
01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:53,110
he would explain it much better.

3419
01:30:53,111 --> 01:30:57,100
Just in that little moment it made me
see something that I hadn't considered.

3420
01:30:57,101 --> 01:30:59,890
Like I'm sure they're doing
dirty shit with it too.

3421
01:30:59,891 --> 01:31:01,490
Like those photos and,

3422
01:31:01,491 --> 01:31:02,021
and again,

3423
01:31:02,021 --> 01:31:03,910
I know the government's propaganda driven,

3424
01:31:03,911 --> 01:31:08,060
but there's also legit uses for it
that I think might've been conquered.

3425
01:31:08,420 --> 01:31:09,860
There's definitely legit uses for it.

3426
01:31:09,861 --> 01:31:10,970
But what Snowden's point was,

3427
01:31:10,971 --> 01:31:15,020
whether you're having these 18 to 22
year old kids and you're giving them this

3428
01:31:15,021 --> 01:31:16,790
massive amount of responsibility,

3429
01:31:17,290 --> 01:31:17,540
right.

3430
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:20,390
And that it's just not cool and
there's very little oversight.

3431
01:31:20,450 --> 01:31:20,781
He's like,

3432
01:31:20,781 --> 01:31:22,610
it's very little oversight
in these offices.

3433
01:31:23,450 --> 01:31:23,750
Yeah.

3434
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:24,081
I mean,

3435
01:31:24,081 --> 01:31:24,950
what was Baker's,

3436
01:31:24,951 --> 01:31:25,400
uh,

3437
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,080
what was his argument against Snowden?

3438
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:28,060
What Snowden did?

3439
01:31:28,060 --> 01:31:28,930
I've only seen this,

3440
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:31,110
he's on red I a lot and a,

3441
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:32,510
he hates him because I tell,

3442
01:31:32,530 --> 01:31:35,110
I only sell a little piece of it
on the episode we did together.

3443
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,210
But Mike's a really logical,

3444
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:38,321
you'd love him.

3445
01:31:38,321 --> 01:31:39,550
Like he's a great talker.

3446
01:31:39,551 --> 01:31:40,361
He's funny.

3447
01:31:40,361 --> 01:31:40,721
He's like,

3448
01:31:40,721 --> 01:31:41,554
he's not some,

3449
01:31:41,890 --> 01:31:42,460
you know,

3450
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:43,151
he's not some,

3451
01:31:43,151 --> 01:31:43,984
uh,

3452
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:45,600
propaganda spewing asshole.

3453
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:46,690
He's got his talking points,

3454
01:31:46,691 --> 01:31:47,770
but he's a really smart dude.

3455
01:31:47,771 --> 01:31:48,091
I think you'd,

3456
01:31:48,091 --> 01:31:48,720
you'd love to have it.

3457
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:49,471
I would love to have him.

3458
01:31:49,471 --> 01:31:53,100
I would love to hear what the argument
against Snowden is because in my opinion,

3459
01:31:53,101 --> 01:31:54,420
what he was doing was something,

3460
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:55,090
what,

3461
01:31:55,090 --> 01:32:00,090
what he released was information that
let the American people know that the

3462
01:32:01,061 --> 01:32:04,540
government was doing something that's
unconstitutional and they were doing it

3463
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:07,420
and they were doing it like they had
the right to do it and they're going to

3464
01:32:07,421 --> 01:32:08,680
continue to have the right to do it.

3465
01:32:08,681 --> 01:32:09,190
They're gonna kill you.

3466
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:10,090
And if they catch him,

3467
01:32:10,091 --> 01:32:13,450
they gonna lock him in
jail for exposing in a way,

3468
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:16,900
everything that Obama said
when he was running for office,

3469
01:32:16,930 --> 01:32:20,520
he said that they were going to have
greater protection of whistle blowers.

3470
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:20,810
Right.

3471
01:32:20,810 --> 01:32:23,410
Anybody that was showing that
they were doing something right,

3472
01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:25,600
that if someone was doing
something that was illegal,

3473
01:32:25,601 --> 01:32:26,590
he was going to protect them.

3474
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:27,101
Meanwhile,

3475
01:32:27,101 --> 01:32:28,030
they had a release,

3476
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:31,150
they had a delete that off of his website
because they kept it up until like a

3477
01:32:31,151 --> 01:32:32,080
year and a half ago.

3478
01:32:32,290 --> 01:32:32,891
And then finally,

3479
01:32:32,891 --> 01:32:33,071
you know,

3480
01:32:33,071 --> 01:32:36,160
people started pointing it out when all
the Snowden shit was going down the hope

3481
01:32:36,161 --> 01:32:38,800
and change website and they
finally redacted at all.

3482
01:32:38,801 --> 01:32:39,200
But

3483
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:39,501
yeah,

3484
01:32:39,501 --> 01:32:39,791
it's a,

3485
01:32:39,791 --> 01:32:41,090
it's a very weird cause I get,

3486
01:32:41,091 --> 01:32:41,541
I agree with you.

3487
01:32:41,541 --> 01:32:42,374
I think that uh,

3488
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:43,280
what he did in the,

3489
01:32:43,281 --> 01:32:44,540
to a certain degree is really good.

3490
01:32:44,541 --> 01:32:46,520
Like I don't want the
government having that ability.

3491
01:32:46,790 --> 01:32:51,740
My point of view on it as I'm so disgusted
with the public and I'm so disgusted

3492
01:32:52,070 --> 01:32:55,760
with what voyeurs we are and how we
refuse to acknowledge that and how we sit

3493
01:32:55,761 --> 01:32:57,860
there and judge people
like Donald Sterling,

3494
01:32:57,890 --> 01:32:59,540
I like the guy's a twat obviously,

3495
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:04,640
but the way everyone sits
there and fucking self
righteously judges this guy and

3496
01:33:04,641 --> 01:33:04,940
I love,

3497
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:09,710
I love the fact that he's
a fucking miserable parrot
voiced 81 year old who now

3498
01:33:09,711 --> 01:33:13,290
wants to fucking hire
private investigators to go
after every NBA owner and

3499
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:14,293
uncover shit.

3500
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:15,051
It's like they,

3501
01:33:15,051 --> 01:33:16,220
none of them stood tall and said,

3502
01:33:16,221 --> 01:33:16,520
look,

3503
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:17,900
this guy is a piece of garbage.

3504
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:18,733
But you know what?

3505
01:33:18,890 --> 01:33:22,550
I've said a lot of ugly things in my
private life style and what he said was

3506
01:33:22,551 --> 01:33:25,850
mine or compared to the
privacy of his own home,

3507
01:33:25,970 --> 01:33:27,560
there was no racial slurs.

3508
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,491
What he said is,

3509
01:33:28,491 --> 01:33:30,110
don't bring these black guys around them.

3510
01:33:30,111 --> 01:33:30,980
Take pictures with them.

3511
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:32,720
Molly's trying to fuck this chick,

3512
01:33:32,721 --> 01:33:33,190
by the way.

3513
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:33,470
Yeah.

3514
01:33:33,470 --> 01:33:35,780
He's just trying to get
past all this and fucker.

3515
01:33:35,930 --> 01:33:36,380
He's like,

3516
01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:37,041
I mean that's his,

3517
01:33:37,041 --> 01:33:37,701
when he said,

3518
01:33:37,701 --> 01:33:38,511
when he was talking about,

3519
01:33:38,511 --> 01:33:38,691
he goes,

3520
01:33:38,691 --> 01:33:38,811
look,

3521
01:33:38,811 --> 01:33:39,830
I was trying to get laid.

3522
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:40,591
I was telling me,

3523
01:33:40,591 --> 01:33:40,761
look,

3524
01:33:40,761 --> 01:33:41,750
don't bring these guys around.

3525
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:42,860
He even said to her,

3526
01:33:42,861 --> 01:33:43,700
if you want to fuck him,

3527
01:33:43,701 --> 01:33:44,180
fuck him.

3528
01:33:44,180 --> 01:33:44,361
He's,

3529
01:33:44,361 --> 01:33:45,470
he's my favorite person.

3530
01:33:45,471 --> 01:33:46,070
No.

3531
01:33:46,070 --> 01:33:46,903
Is he a racist?

3532
01:33:46,910 --> 01:33:47,800
Probably Z.

3533
01:33:47,810 --> 01:33:50,060
A piece of shit by all accounts.

3534
01:33:50,061 --> 01:33:50,630
Sure,

3535
01:33:50,630 --> 01:33:51,530
but so what?

3536
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:56,600
How do you find a guy two point $5
million for telling his girlfriend not to

3537
01:33:56,601 --> 01:33:58,100
bring black guys around the games.

3538
01:33:58,280 --> 01:33:59,330
That's crazy.

3539
01:33:59,420 --> 01:33:59,690
Right?

3540
01:33:59,690 --> 01:34:00,560
It's his girlfriend.

3541
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:03,590
He's not saying you don't associate
with those people because they are below

3542
01:34:03,591 --> 01:34:04,130
human.

3543
01:34:04,130 --> 01:34:05,810
He's not saying anything crazy and racist.

3544
01:34:05,811 --> 01:34:06,410
He's like,

3545
01:34:06,410 --> 01:34:06,890
look,

3546
01:34:06,890 --> 01:34:09,950
you bring in guys around
that are definitely going
to fuck you and it makes me

3547
01:34:09,951 --> 01:34:10,550
look bad.

3548
01:34:10,550 --> 01:34:11,200
Yeah.

3549
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,860
That's the only slowly it's always saying,

3550
01:34:12,950 --> 01:34:14,930
and even if he was being a creepy racist,

3551
01:34:14,990 --> 01:34:18,320
even if he was the fact that
it was in private and bay,

3552
01:34:18,380 --> 01:34:18,951
they got the,

3553
01:34:18,951 --> 01:34:21,980
I think in California
there's only two states,

3554
01:34:21,981 --> 01:34:22,680
one party,

3555
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:23,750
a notification states.

3556
01:34:23,751 --> 01:34:25,610
I'm thinking they're into New York is one.

3557
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:26,430
Yeah.

3558
01:34:26,430 --> 01:34:28,610
[inaudible] and I think that uh,

3559
01:34:28,850 --> 01:34:30,860
the fact that was illegally
obtained information.

3560
01:34:30,861 --> 01:34:31,280
Yeah.

3561
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:31,730
And again,

3562
01:34:31,730 --> 01:34:36,730
I think the guy I told Jabar wrote a
fucking genius article on why this guy

3563
01:34:37,790 --> 01:34:38,930
should have been God after,

3564
01:34:38,931 --> 01:34:41,580
before for a lot of the housing
discrimination and stuff,

3565
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:42,650
but not for this.

3566
01:34:42,650 --> 01:34:42,890
Right.

3567
01:34:42,890 --> 01:34:44,240
And no one gave a fuck when it was that,

3568
01:34:44,241 --> 01:34:45,170
but now that it's language,

3569
01:34:45,171 --> 01:34:45,901
they're going after him.

3570
01:34:45,901 --> 01:34:46,001
Yeah.

3571
01:34:46,001 --> 01:34:49,340
And then they're using
the housing discrimination
stuff to justify their going

3572
01:34:49,341 --> 01:34:50,360
after I'm about this.

3573
01:34:50,361 --> 01:34:50,600
I'm like,

3574
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:50,811
no,

3575
01:34:50,811 --> 01:34:51,021
look,

3576
01:34:51,021 --> 01:34:53,120
the housing discrimination
stuff is fucked.

3577
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:54,103
Your right.

3578
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:55,790
If you want to find them for that,

3579
01:34:55,791 --> 01:34:57,150
then it should be some sort of another,

3580
01:34:57,770 --> 01:34:58,040
not the

3581
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:58,880
NBA.

3582
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:00,770
NBA just reacted again.

3583
01:35:00,771 --> 01:35:01,520
They panicked,

3584
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:05,930
they reacted quickly and not one of these
owners has a clean fucking backyard.

3585
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:06,501
None of,

3586
01:35:06,501 --> 01:35:07,850
maybe they haven't said racist stuff,

3587
01:35:08,090 --> 01:35:10,760
but a lot of them are probably
fucked around on their wives.

3588
01:35:10,761 --> 01:35:12,710
A lot of them have
probably said sexist stuff.

3589
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:15,710
So I love the fact of
sterling's going to hire a,

3590
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:16,380
uh,

3591
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:16,570
but,

3592
01:35:16,570 --> 01:35:20,240
but this is like how dirty it gets
when people aren't honest about our own

3593
01:35:20,270 --> 01:35:21,100
ugliness.

3594
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:21,381
Like,

3595
01:35:21,381 --> 01:35:23,810
and that's why when a guy likes
Snowden does what he does,

3596
01:35:25,010 --> 01:35:25,640
it's like,

3597
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:26,420
ah,

3598
01:35:26,420 --> 01:35:26,700
I,

3599
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:27,200
the NSA,

3600
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:27,981
the NSA.

3601
01:35:27,981 --> 01:35:28,191
Yeah,

3602
01:35:28,191 --> 01:35:29,024
there's Shitty,

3603
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:30,530
but fuck the public.

3604
01:35:30,650 --> 01:35:32,540
Because the public didn't stand up in,

3605
01:35:32,541 --> 01:35:32,741
in,

3606
01:35:32,741 --> 01:35:32,971
in,

3607
01:35:32,971 --> 01:35:36,050
in the fucking defensive privacy
when it was Donald Sterling.

3608
01:35:36,350 --> 01:35:38,360
We only care about it when it's ourselves.

3609
01:35:38,660 --> 01:35:41,660
And if we were a public that would
never have tolerated that from the

3610
01:35:41,661 --> 01:35:42,290
government,

3611
01:35:42,290 --> 01:35:43,123
they wouldn't do it.

3612
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:43,461
Like,

3613
01:35:43,461 --> 01:35:43,670
you know,

3614
01:35:43,670 --> 01:35:44,230
or they would,

3615
01:35:44,230 --> 01:35:47,450
they would do it and be terrified to do
it knowing that we were going to revolt,

3616
01:35:47,630 --> 01:35:50,930
but they know that we'll just take it
because we're nosy cons and we don't

3617
01:35:50,931 --> 01:35:51,390
really bother.

3618
01:35:51,390 --> 01:35:51,890
We liked,

3619
01:35:51,890 --> 01:35:54,590
we like invading people's
privacy and tiger woods,

3620
01:35:54,591 --> 01:35:55,490
his text messages,

3621
01:35:55,670 --> 01:35:55,851
oh,

3622
01:35:55,851 --> 01:35:56,541
we can't get enough.

3623
01:35:56,541 --> 01:36:00,770
A Mel Gibson's voicemails but fucking
scumbags just sitting home wringing our

3624
01:36:00,771 --> 01:36:01,310
hands.

3625
01:36:01,310 --> 01:36:02,140
Have you ever heard

3626
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:05,590
with sociologists say about that when it
comes to gossip and things along those

3627
01:36:05,591 --> 01:36:06,340
lines?

3628
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:07,420
They believe that we,

3629
01:36:07,421 --> 01:36:11,440
we no longer have communities like
we used to have when we were tribal

3630
01:36:11,441 --> 01:36:12,251
organizations.

3631
01:36:12,251 --> 01:36:15,400
When were groups of 50 to 150 200 people,

3632
01:36:15,401 --> 01:36:16,300
small groups.

3633
01:36:16,510 --> 01:36:19,690
And then we used to know each other's
business cause we had to be aware.

3634
01:36:19,990 --> 01:36:21,700
We had to know who was a good guy,

3635
01:36:21,701 --> 01:36:22,720
who was a bad guy.

3636
01:36:22,721 --> 01:36:26,590
We had to talk and exchange and we also
had to figure out what other people

3637
01:36:26,650 --> 01:36:30,250
liked and tolerated what was
accepted on our community.

3638
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:33,700
And now we don't really have the sort
of relationships with our neighbors

3639
01:36:33,701 --> 01:36:34,534
anymore.

3640
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:36,370
And so celebrity gossip,

3641
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:36,941
gossip,

3642
01:36:36,941 --> 01:36:37,600
it's in the news.

3643
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,220
Whenever someone is doing something,

3644
01:36:39,221 --> 01:36:42,370
it becomes extra juicy
to us because we don't,

3645
01:36:42,430 --> 01:36:46,390
we don't have this normal
communication amongst the people that,

3646
01:36:46,391 --> 01:36:46,721
you know,

3647
01:36:46,721 --> 01:36:47,001
we,

3648
01:36:47,001 --> 01:36:50,500
we have in our local community that,

3649
01:36:50,620 --> 01:36:50,980
yeah,

3650
01:36:50,980 --> 01:36:51,670
that is true.

3651
01:36:51,670 --> 01:36:52,260
I mean we do.

3652
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:53,620
Who Do you know in your building?

3653
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:55,070
I'm almost numb.

3654
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:56,010
It's funny as we speak,

3655
01:36:56,011 --> 01:36:58,320
Obama's in my building in
New York doing a fundraiser.

3656
01:36:58,440 --> 01:36:59,490
He doesn't leave the building.

3657
01:36:59,520 --> 01:36:59,881
He's in my,

3658
01:36:59,881 --> 01:37:00,611
in my apartment building.

3659
01:37:00,611 --> 01:37:03,810
And you get in there while he's there or
is it for some fucking pain that Dick,

3660
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:04,441
I probably could,

3661
01:37:04,441 --> 01:37:06,060
I mean he might be gone already.

3662
01:37:06,061 --> 01:37:07,920
He was some Democratic fundraiser,

3663
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:08,460
but I don't know.

3664
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:08,880
I don't know.

3665
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:09,630
The point is,

3666
01:37:09,630 --> 01:37:10,021
I don't know.

3667
01:37:10,021 --> 01:37:10,890
The neighbor he's seeing,

3668
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:11,970
he's probably seeing something,

3669
01:37:11,971 --> 01:37:13,890
one of the neighbors for a fundraiser
and I have no idea who it is.

3670
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:14,760
How annoying.

3671
01:37:14,910 --> 01:37:15,870
I would love to be there though.

3672
01:37:15,871 --> 01:37:18,300
It's be kind of fun just to
be in the elevator with him.

3673
01:37:18,510 --> 01:37:20,430
I don't think male meet
you a Kakou together.

3674
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:22,350
I'll meet you a calculus
fucking who I saw the other day,

3675
01:37:22,351 --> 01:37:22,611
by the way,

3676
01:37:22,611 --> 01:37:24,000
walking into the building and I'm like,

3677
01:37:24,001 --> 01:37:25,160
hi Ha.

3678
01:37:25,350 --> 01:37:26,020
He literally,

3679
01:37:26,020 --> 01:37:27,870
if a fucking rabbit ran by,

3680
01:37:27,871 --> 01:37:29,850
he would have recognized it more than me,

3681
01:37:29,851 --> 01:37:30,021
who?

3682
01:37:30,021 --> 01:37:31,680
He sat as close as we are and talked.

3683
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:33,000
He's a genius,

3684
01:37:33,001 --> 01:37:34,140
but he's a fucking weird dude.

3685
01:37:34,141 --> 01:37:34,974
He's a very weird,

3686
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:35,291
oh,

3687
01:37:35,291 --> 01:37:35,620
hi.

3688
01:37:35,620 --> 01:37:36,270
Hey.

3689
01:37:36,270 --> 01:37:36,381
He'll,

3690
01:37:36,381 --> 01:37:38,700
he's frightened to always make
fun of because he refuses to,

3691
01:37:38,701 --> 01:37:39,120
like,

3692
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:40,290
you just can't say hello.

3693
01:37:40,470 --> 01:37:41,191
Hi Dr Kako.

3694
01:37:41,191 --> 01:37:41,910
Ha.

3695
01:37:41,910 --> 01:37:42,560
He's just so,

3696
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:45,150
it's like how many times you've been
assaulted that you're so timid when people

3697
01:37:45,151 --> 01:37:45,780
say hello to you,

3698
01:37:45,780 --> 01:37:47,940
he gets shit on by other scientists,

3699
01:37:47,941 --> 01:37:48,774
you know?

3700
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:48,961
Well,

3701
01:37:48,961 --> 01:37:50,070
he oversimplifies it.

3702
01:37:50,071 --> 01:37:50,650
Like I like,

3703
01:37:50,650 --> 01:37:50,851
uh,

3704
01:37:50,851 --> 01:37:54,530
I like Brian Greene is the
guy's name and I also like a,

3705
01:37:54,531 --> 01:37:58,720
and Neil degrasse Tyson yells because
they simplify it because we are dumbbells

3706
01:37:58,770 --> 01:37:59,760
in comparison to them,

3707
01:38:00,030 --> 01:38:02,460
but they don't talk to
us like we're complete.

3708
01:38:02,461 --> 01:38:03,211
Blithering like,

3709
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:03,331
you know,

3710
01:38:03,331 --> 01:38:04,830
doctor Kako breaks it down,

3711
01:38:04,831 --> 01:38:05,011
like,

3712
01:38:05,011 --> 01:38:05,550
you know,

3713
01:38:05,550 --> 01:38:08,430
and if you look at it like
everyone is in lemon drop,

3714
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:08,731
it's like,

3715
01:38:08,731 --> 01:38:09,180
all right,

3716
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:10,980
I don't have a fucking Phd,

3717
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:12,631
but I understand that,

3718
01:38:12,631 --> 01:38:12,841
you know,

3719
01:38:12,841 --> 01:38:13,730
cells exist.

3720
01:38:13,740 --> 01:38:13,951
You can,

3721
01:38:13,951 --> 01:38:15,240
we can find somewhere in the middle too,

3722
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:15,870
you know?

3723
01:38:15,870 --> 01:38:16,201
Yeah.

3724
01:38:16,201 --> 01:38:17,310
I don't know why it doesn't.

3725
01:38:17,311 --> 01:38:18,750
Dr Steve Get upset at him.

3726
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:19,810
Oh yeah.

3727
01:38:20,140 --> 01:38:21,600
Doctor Steve is my favorite.

3728
01:38:21,620 --> 01:38:22,110
I love him.

3729
01:38:22,110 --> 01:38:23,250
He's the fucking best.

3730
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:23,700
Um,

3731
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:24,061
cause he,

3732
01:38:24,061 --> 01:38:24,211
you know,

3733
01:38:24,211 --> 01:38:27,630
he took physics so he's
another brilliant guy and he,

3734
01:38:27,631 --> 01:38:28,021
hey ya,

3735
01:38:28,021 --> 01:38:29,010
I just don't like him.

3736
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:29,410
You know,

3737
01:38:29,410 --> 01:38:30,243
he's just,

3738
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:31,313
yeah,

3739
01:38:31,330 --> 01:38:32,610
he's just a fucking idiot.

3740
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:34,073
He just,

3741
01:38:34,230 --> 01:38:37,050
he knows he's smart but he doesn't
like the way Dr Steve Will.

3742
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:38,820
I'm doctor [inaudible] doctor
[inaudible] who will kind of,

3743
01:38:38,821 --> 01:38:39,100
I guess,

3744
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:42,180
I guess they look at him like we would
look at it as a comedian doing girl fart

3745
01:38:42,181 --> 01:38:43,690
jokes on TV.

3746
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:45,121
Like yo no,

3747
01:38:45,121 --> 01:38:45,361
look at,

3748
01:38:45,361 --> 01:38:46,051
he's got the puppet,

3749
01:38:46,051 --> 01:38:47,370
the puppet saying naughty things.

3750
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:48,520
So boys break.

3751
01:38:49,290 --> 01:38:51,510
Is there anything worse than when
people will come up to you and go like,

3752
01:38:51,511 --> 01:38:51,691
Oh,

3753
01:38:51,691 --> 01:38:53,130
and I love this comedian and you're like,

3754
01:38:53,131 --> 01:38:56,010
I want to just bite your fucking
nose or you were so funny.

3755
01:38:56,011 --> 01:38:56,380
But you know,

3756
01:38:56,380 --> 01:38:57,213
my favorite is,

3757
01:38:57,350 --> 01:38:57,980
Oh,

3758
01:38:57,980 --> 01:38:58,321
you go,

3759
01:38:58,321 --> 01:39:01,620
oh you just ruined everything
where my favorite jokey or is,

3760
01:39:01,621 --> 01:39:02,970
and they're like named
the joke that you're like,

3761
01:39:02,971 --> 01:39:03,511
oh Christ,

3762
01:39:03,511 --> 01:39:07,950
that was the fucking joke I should be
probably throat slit for that was from

3763
01:39:07,951 --> 01:39:08,940
1996.

3764
01:39:08,941 --> 01:39:09,450
Yeah.

3765
01:39:09,450 --> 01:39:10,800
Can't believe that he would remembers it.

3766
01:39:10,801 --> 01:39:11,460
I'm sad.

3767
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:11,760
Yeah.

3768
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:14,250
I see what jumping like getting
a woody and I called it a woody.

3769
01:39:16,690 --> 01:39:20,070
You ever remember your old stuff
and just die a little death inside?

3770
01:39:20,150 --> 01:39:21,000
It's online.

3771
01:39:21,001 --> 01:39:21,860
You can watch it.

3772
01:39:22,210 --> 01:39:23,970
There's a video of me from Caroline's,

3773
01:39:24,450 --> 01:39:25,231
not Caroline,

3774
01:39:25,231 --> 01:39:26,820
so rascals.

3775
01:39:26,970 --> 01:39:28,140
Oh Wow.

3776
01:39:28,410 --> 01:39:29,310
Was it the TV show?

3777
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:29,630
Yeah,

3778
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:31,110
we're in terrible clothes.

3779
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:31,560
Tony.

3780
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:32,670
Terrible jokes.

3781
01:39:33,290 --> 01:39:34,140
Wallpaper shirt.

3782
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:34,710
Yeah.

3783
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:39,710
I've got a recording somewhere of like
my third or fourth time ever on stage.

3784
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:44,250
I have like a whole stack of shit that I
saved and one of them is like the third

3785
01:39:44,251 --> 01:39:45,660
or fourth time I was ever on stage.

3786
01:39:45,661 --> 01:39:46,800
It's a cassette recording.

3787
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:47,930
It's just hot.

3788
01:39:47,930 --> 01:39:48,660
It could stuff.

3789
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:49,530
Hot Death.

3790
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:53,010
It's great to have it though.

3791
01:39:53,130 --> 01:39:56,310
I guess I've looked at it and
fear for fucking 20 years.

3792
01:39:57,270 --> 01:40:01,860
Oddly humiliating exposing when you
see that stuff like I wonder if other

3793
01:40:01,861 --> 01:40:05,630
performers look at their old shit
like we did a thing on ona where we,

3794
01:40:06,010 --> 01:40:08,880
you maybe heard summit where we brought
in our old tapes and got killed for it.

3795
01:40:09,870 --> 01:40:14,870
This is back in new and I brought in a
tape of me from 1993 where I had like 20

3796
01:40:16,531 --> 01:40:21,180
minutes of material and I
was a fucking please love me.

3797
01:40:21,181 --> 01:40:22,350
Happy go lucky.

3798
01:40:22,351 --> 01:40:23,910
High Energy fraud.

3799
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:25,900
Like it's the type of,

3800
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:26,240
it's,

3801
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:26,461
it's,

3802
01:40:26,461 --> 01:40:26,731
it's,

3803
01:40:26,731 --> 01:40:28,440
it's humiliating in a weird level.

3804
01:40:28,441 --> 01:40:31,510
I had like purple pants
and like I always talk I,

3805
01:40:31,580 --> 01:40:32,011
yeah,

3806
01:40:32,011 --> 01:40:32,431
exactly.

3807
01:40:32,431 --> 01:40:33,350
They were fucking nod.

3808
01:40:33,351 --> 01:40:36,070
They would like to have those
a workout pants from the 80s.

3809
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:36,361
Like those,

3810
01:40:36,361 --> 01:40:36,890
uh,

3811
01:40:36,890 --> 01:40:40,370
whenever they went with the velcro front
and I would bring an enema in a bag on

3812
01:40:40,371 --> 01:40:41,161
stage and talking about,

3813
01:40:41,161 --> 01:40:43,230
cause enemas were addicting and I,

3814
01:40:43,300 --> 01:40:44,133
it was,

3815
01:40:44,170 --> 01:40:44,460
it's,

3816
01:40:44,460 --> 01:40:45,390
you wouldn't need to be friendly.

3817
01:40:45,410 --> 01:40:46,710
Collin Quinn told me like,

3818
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:47,131
he's like,

3819
01:40:47,131 --> 01:40:49,080
it's hard for me to look at
you like listening to this.

3820
01:40:49,081 --> 01:40:49,914
I can't acknowledge.

3821
01:40:51,030 --> 01:40:51,691
And this was in,

3822
01:40:51,691 --> 01:40:52,481
we did this in ninth,

3823
01:40:52,481 --> 01:40:53,140
in 2000.

3824
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:54,130
So it was 17 years

3825
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:54,963
after I had done it.

3826
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:55,840
Wow.

3827
01:40:55,870 --> 01:40:58,640
But the guys that came
into to talk about my tape,

3828
01:40:58,680 --> 01:40:59,230
Collin,

3829
01:40:59,230 --> 01:41:01,150
Patrice and Voss,

3830
01:41:01,570 --> 01:41:06,570
we're the guys that dissected my tape and
it was one of the most savage assaults

3831
01:41:07,601 --> 01:41:12,340
of all time and we did bosses tape too
when he had the fucking bad teeth and the

3832
01:41:12,341 --> 01:41:16,450
greasy long locks Voss looked
like a rat receive boss.

3833
01:41:17,620 --> 01:41:17,741
Oh,

3834
01:41:17,741 --> 01:41:18,161
that's right.

3835
01:41:18,161 --> 01:41:18,521
That's right.

3836
01:41:18,521 --> 01:41:19,060
Yes.

3837
01:41:19,060 --> 01:41:21,310
Then he was brilliant.

3838
01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:23,080
I was a fast talker.

3839
01:41:23,470 --> 01:41:27,130
Fucking please love me.

3840
01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:28,121
Oh,

3841
01:41:28,121 --> 01:41:28,960
hunched over.

3842
01:41:28,961 --> 01:41:30,370
Like I used to smoke a lot of pot,

3843
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:31,233
like Oh,

3844
01:41:31,630 --> 01:41:32,381
I met Voss.

3845
01:41:32,381 --> 01:41:36,250
I think in 90 or 91 we were
all terrible than though.

3846
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:39,910
I mean that's the one thing that
I always stress to every comedian.

3847
01:41:40,030 --> 01:41:41,890
No one starts out good.

3848
01:41:42,130 --> 01:41:43,000
They just don't,

3849
01:41:43,430 --> 01:41:43,810
you know,

3850
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:44,643
they just don't,

3851
01:41:44,770 --> 01:41:48,460
everyone sucks at first and especially
when you're young because you don't have

3852
01:41:48,461 --> 01:41:49,294
shit to say.

3853
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:50,590
When I was 21 with the,

3854
01:41:50,591 --> 01:41:52,480
who the fuck am I to be talking?

3855
01:41:52,870 --> 01:41:53,111
You know,

3856
01:41:53,111 --> 01:41:54,220
I don't have anything to say.

3857
01:41:54,370 --> 01:41:57,430
The only thing that I had to say about
anything that was funny at all was sex

3858
01:41:57,700 --> 01:41:58,870
because he's the only thing I knew.

3859
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:01,440
I mean everything I knew besides that me,

3860
01:42:01,450 --> 01:42:03,040
what did I know about politics?

3861
01:42:03,041 --> 01:42:04,640
What did I know about
the way the world works?

3862
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:05,650
What did I know about anything?

3863
01:42:05,651 --> 01:42:06,071
I don't know.

3864
01:42:06,071 --> 01:42:07,120
Opinions about anything.

3865
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:07,661
Yeah,

3866
01:42:07,661 --> 01:42:10,420
but it wasn't even the bad jokes I had.

3867
01:42:10,421 --> 01:42:12,250
It wasn't even the poorly written jokes,

3868
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:13,180
which they were.

3869
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:16,030
It was the fucking behavior.

3870
01:42:16,330 --> 01:42:18,130
They'll wacky character,

3871
01:42:18,131 --> 01:42:20,980
like the lack of connection
to who I am as a person.

3872
01:42:21,310 --> 01:42:21,731
That just,

3873
01:42:21,731 --> 01:42:24,030
it makes you want to fucking it.

3874
01:42:24,070 --> 01:42:25,990
I want to smash my face
when I watched that,

3875
01:42:25,991 --> 01:42:27,970
like how did you allow
yourself to do this?

3876
01:42:27,970 --> 01:42:29,770
Like not in just not this Voss.

3877
01:42:29,830 --> 01:42:30,940
Oh my God.

3878
01:42:32,830 --> 01:42:34,210
Look at his gold chains.

3879
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:37,630
He looks like fucking Joanie from happy
days when she was in her early thirties

3880
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:39,640
if that fucking creepy perm,

3881
01:42:39,670 --> 01:42:42,700
I would an awful person and funny
connection that we all have to each other.

3882
01:42:42,701 --> 01:42:45,610
We've all gone through
the early days of comedy.

3883
01:42:45,820 --> 01:42:46,211
You know,

3884
01:42:46,211 --> 01:42:46,571
there's,

3885
01:42:46,571 --> 01:42:50,650
there's something that it's always going
to be a weird bond that we all have

3886
01:42:50,651 --> 01:42:53,800
with each other and we all knew
each other back in those days.

3887
01:42:53,830 --> 01:42:54,970
I remember the first time I met you,

3888
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:55,960
I remember where we work.

3889
01:42:56,620 --> 01:43:01,600
I remember you is my first memory of
Rogan was we were working in the upper

3890
01:43:01,601 --> 01:43:01,900
deck.

3891
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:02,733
I think I've totally

3892
01:43:03,970 --> 01:43:04,803
terrible.

3893
01:43:04,870 --> 01:43:06,820
They were terrible gap in them.

3894
01:43:08,850 --> 01:43:11,330
That's the boss I met Kim by late today,

3895
01:43:11,410 --> 01:43:12,011
that Voss,

3896
01:43:12,011 --> 01:43:12,731
the guy you're looking at,

3897
01:43:12,731 --> 01:43:17,731
that ugly awful Voss was
a pussy machinery machine.

3898
01:43:18,490 --> 01:43:22,510
And he would get girls like just to suck
his dick in front of me or he would try

3899
01:43:22,511 --> 01:43:26,620
to get them to suck my Dick Voss was
the fucking team player of all time.

3900
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:30,130
Like he's gotten more assists than
almost anybody in the business.

3901
01:43:30,150 --> 01:43:32,500
And he would get girls to just come
in the closet and look at my Dick,

3902
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:34,793
who's a great friend.

3903
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:37,150
He's a good,

3904
01:43:37,150 --> 01:43:39,130
he's a great guy and
shit on a lot buddies.

3905
01:43:39,150 --> 01:43:42,010
He's the best is the fucking one
of the best guys I've ever known.

3906
01:43:42,011 --> 01:43:42,910
So where did we meet?

3907
01:43:43,230 --> 01:43:43,420
Uh,

3908
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:43,901
upper deck.

3909
01:43:43,901 --> 01:43:45,040
It was a Pat Guarini Gig,

3910
01:43:45,041 --> 01:43:45,400
I think.

3911
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:45,971
Upper deck.

3912
01:43:45,971 --> 01:43:47,020
Where's that lake?

3913
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:48,130
A pack on New Jersey.

3914
01:43:48,550 --> 01:43:51,230
And you were on stage doing a
bit about Tyson and Robin givens.

3915
01:43:51,470 --> 01:43:51,980
And you said

3916
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:52,491
something about,

3917
01:43:52,491 --> 01:43:53,680
imagine you walk out and it's my time.

3918
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:55,490
I like to talk to you for a second please.

3919
01:43:55,660 --> 01:43:58,340
And I just remember
that line from your act.

3920
01:43:58,341 --> 01:43:59,174
I don't remember.

3921
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:00,950
You had a lot of energy and you were,

3922
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:03,230
you were very powerful performer,

3923
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:06,200
but I remember that line for
some reason from your act.

3924
01:44:06,230 --> 01:44:06,471
Wow.

3925
01:44:06,471 --> 01:44:07,480
I don't even remember that long.

3926
01:44:07,481 --> 01:44:08,900
It's probably 90 to 93.

3927
01:44:08,930 --> 01:44:09,500
Wow.

3928
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:10,430
Back in the day.

3929
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:12,530
It's a fascinating thing to go through,

3930
01:44:12,531 --> 01:44:12,900
isn't it?

3931
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:14,260
You know it again.

3932
01:44:14,630 --> 01:44:15,463
Damn Dude,

3933
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:16,633
I been holding it.

3934
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,090
I'm the,

3935
01:44:17,090 --> 01:44:17,390
this way.

3936
01:44:17,390 --> 01:44:17,901
I have to fly.

3937
01:44:17,901 --> 01:44:18,230
I'll,

3938
01:44:18,230 --> 01:44:19,160
I have a bladder.

3939
01:44:19,430 --> 01:44:19,581
Yeah,

3940
01:44:19,581 --> 01:44:19,851
I do.

3941
01:44:19,851 --> 01:44:20,310
And I thought I,

3942
01:44:20,310 --> 01:44:20,620
you know,

3943
01:44:20,620 --> 01:44:21,470
by like Patrice,

3944
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:23,900
Patrice told me fucking,

3945
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:24,530
uh,

3946
01:44:24,530 --> 01:44:25,161
he says to me,

3947
01:44:25,161 --> 01:44:25,580
he goes,

3948
01:44:25,580 --> 01:44:25,910
you know,

3949
01:44:25,910 --> 01:44:26,140
you,

3950
01:44:26,140 --> 01:44:27,550
you have to just be checked for diabetes.

3951
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:31,580
So I flew to La for the first time with
Patrice and the TWA was a seven 47.

3952
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:32,750
There's those two seats.

3953
01:44:32,751 --> 01:44:35,960
And I took the window and let that
fucking behemoth have the ILC.

3954
01:44:36,290 --> 01:44:37,880
And I had to keep crawling over him.

3955
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:39,410
And Patrice who was diabetic,

3956
01:44:39,411 --> 01:44:39,711
said,

3957
01:44:39,711 --> 01:44:40,250
uh,

3958
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:40,641
you know,

3959
01:44:40,641 --> 01:44:41,900
you've got to get
checked for diabetes now.

3960
01:44:41,930 --> 01:44:44,480
You pissed so much and he fucking
freaked me out and I don't have it.

3961
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:45,340
I just hit the pis.

3962
01:44:45,340 --> 01:44:45,820
But my,

3963
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:46,760
during a lot of water,

3964
01:44:46,910 --> 01:44:47,421
lots of water,

3965
01:44:47,421 --> 01:44:48,350
a lot of caffeine.

3966
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:52,280
I drink a diet coke before in the caffeine
does something to my fucking bladder.

3967
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:52,881
Yeah,

3968
01:44:52,881 --> 01:44:53,571
it does.

3969
01:44:53,571 --> 01:44:56,420
My Goldberg drinks a lot of those red
bulls and when we worked together,

3970
01:44:56,421 --> 01:44:58,070
that guy gets up and pisses like six,

3971
01:44:58,071 --> 01:44:59,540
seven times during a broadcast.

3972
01:44:59,570 --> 01:45:00,650
I wonder how you guys do that,

3973
01:45:00,651 --> 01:45:01,040
by the way.

3974
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:02,620
How do you not just jump up
and pitch them right to this?

3975
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:03,950
I guess I never noticed that he did.

3976
01:45:04,010 --> 01:45:05,030
I can just hold it.

3977
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:05,630
Really?

3978
01:45:05,630 --> 01:45:06,320
Yeah.

3979
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:07,190
I don't know what it is.

3980
01:45:07,191 --> 01:45:08,150
I dig muscle boo.

3981
01:45:08,420 --> 01:45:09,920
I got a great deck muscle son.

3982
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:10,580
Yeah,

3983
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:11,670
I worked at shit out.

3984
01:45:12,260 --> 01:45:12,951
I don't know what it is.

3985
01:45:12,951 --> 01:45:13,721
I can just like,

3986
01:45:13,721 --> 01:45:14,960
I do three hour podcasts.

3987
01:45:14,961 --> 01:45:18,710
It's very rare that I have to pee during
a three hour podcasts unless I drank a

3988
01:45:18,711 --> 01:45:20,180
lot of stuff before the show,

3989
01:45:20,690 --> 01:45:21,021
you know?

3990
01:45:21,021 --> 01:45:24,860
But if you drink any of those red
bulls or those monster energy drinks,

3991
01:45:25,070 --> 01:45:26,810
those we'll do me if I drink one of those.

3992
01:45:26,811 --> 01:45:27,110
Go ahead.

3993
01:45:27,110 --> 01:45:27,943
Go on.

3994
01:45:28,130 --> 01:45:28,731
This coffee,

3995
01:45:28,731 --> 01:45:29,780
by the way is delicious.

3996
01:45:29,900 --> 01:45:30,261
It's awesome.

3997
01:45:30,261 --> 01:45:30,530
Right?

3998
01:45:30,530 --> 01:45:31,640
Right to the bathroom.

3999
01:45:31,670 --> 01:45:32,810
That's brave man coffee.

4000
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:33,561
It's fucking great.

4001
01:45:33,561 --> 01:45:34,700
Caveman Coffee Company.

4002
01:45:35,390 --> 01:45:35,900
Um,

4003
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:36,201
yeah.

4004
01:45:36,201 --> 01:45:37,250
I don't know what it is man.

4005
01:45:37,251 --> 01:45:38,930
But those monster energy drinks,

4006
01:45:38,931 --> 01:45:43,040
whatever it is in those
taurine or whatever the fuck,

4007
01:45:43,041 --> 01:45:45,530
the caffeinated aspect of them.

4008
01:45:45,630 --> 01:45:46,380
I've always had good,

4009
01:45:46,380 --> 01:45:47,040
good.

4010
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:47,880
Make it good bladder.

4011
01:45:47,881 --> 01:45:48,241
I guess.

4012
01:45:48,241 --> 01:45:48,901
Like I've never,

4013
01:45:48,901 --> 01:45:49,740
I don't have to pee that much.

4014
01:45:49,741 --> 01:45:51,210
Like I could drink this whole thing,

4015
01:45:51,211 --> 01:45:53,520
this Trenta iced coffee
and I'm now a drink,

4016
01:45:53,521 --> 01:45:54,780
a coco cafe after.

4017
01:45:54,781 --> 01:45:54,931
Right.

4018
01:45:54,931 --> 01:45:56,040
And I still haven't peed all day.

4019
01:45:56,070 --> 01:45:56,341
You know,

4020
01:45:56,341 --> 01:45:58,170
it was cocoa cafes are God damn delicious.

4021
01:45:58,171 --> 01:45:58,591
They're great,

4022
01:45:58,591 --> 01:45:59,020
aren't they?

4023
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:00,340
No one's ever had those before.

4024
01:46:00,341 --> 01:46:00,971
What they are is,

4025
01:46:00,971 --> 01:46:01,690
it's a,

4026
01:46:01,690 --> 01:46:02,590
and they don't pay us.

4027
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:03,633
I just wanna let you know.

4028
01:46:03,910 --> 01:46:04,240
They just,

4029
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:04,960
they're just yummy.

4030
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:05,793
It tastes like a Yahoo.

4031
01:46:05,810 --> 01:46:05,980
Yeah.

4032
01:46:05,980 --> 01:46:10,330
It's coconut water and a espresso mixed
together and they have different flavors

4033
01:46:10,331 --> 01:46:10,540
now.

4034
01:46:10,540 --> 01:46:10,781

01:46:41,111 --> 01:46:41,800
this weekend,

4071
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:42,010
uh,

4072
01:46:42,010 --> 01:46:44,470
Ahmed wise guys in Salt Lake City,

4073
01:46:44,471 --> 01:46:46,480
but it's all sold out bitches.

4074
01:46:46,940 --> 01:46:47,960
Sorry.

4075
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:49,790
Socket heard.

4076
01:46:49,791 --> 01:46:50,060
That place

4077
01:46:50,060 --> 01:46:50,670
is cool.

4078
01:46:50,670 --> 01:46:50,881
Yeah,

4079
01:46:50,881 --> 01:46:52,830
I heard it's cool to Joey
keeps saying it's awesome.

4080
01:46:53,070 --> 01:46:53,610
Um,

4081
01:46:53,610 --> 01:46:55,260
everybody that I know
that's been there and you,

4082
01:46:55,261 --> 01:46:56,310
you worked at Salt Lake City,

4083
01:46:56,311 --> 01:46:56,521
right?

4084
01:46:56,521 --> 01:46:57,040
You might have,

4085
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:57,301
yes.

4086
01:46:57,301 --> 01:46:58,134
Very good room.

4087
01:46:58,800 --> 01:46:59,670
The ally's guys.

4088
01:47:00,030 --> 01:47:00,211
Yeah.

4089
01:47:00,211 --> 01:47:02,880
I feel sorry for those people living in
Salt Lake City surrounded by all those

4090
01:47:02,881 --> 01:47:03,390
Mormons.

4091
01:47:03,390 --> 01:47:04,350
But it's beautiful there.

4092
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:07,080
And Mormons are nice if you're
gonna be around religious nutters,

4093
01:47:07,350 --> 01:47:08,183
those are the people.

4094
01:47:08,370 --> 01:47:10,590
They're not mean people at all
and all Donna's and Mormon.

4095
01:47:10,591 --> 01:47:11,424
She was,

4096
01:47:11,630 --> 01:47:12,600
yes she was.

4097
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:14,680
Was she made me,

4098
01:47:14,681 --> 01:47:15,514
she was getting it.

4099
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:15,991
No,

4100
01:47:15,991 --> 01:47:16,824
she probably,

4101
01:47:16,890 --> 01:47:18,960
I think they probably found
it on that career decision.

4102
01:47:19,380 --> 01:47:19,860
Yeah.

4103
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:20,610
I don't know why though.

4104
01:47:20,610 --> 01:47:21,443
She retired.

4105
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:25,040
She did you say it like it was sadness?

4106
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:26,970
It was like a fucking
like babe Ruth retired.

4107
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:28,770
I just haven't seen her in a while.

4108
01:47:28,771 --> 01:47:29,604
She did it.

4109
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:30,541
She made that.

4110
01:47:30,541 --> 01:47:31,290
She made it really?

4111
01:47:31,290 --> 01:47:33,370
I was luckiest girl in
the face of the earth.

4112
01:47:33,750 --> 01:47:37,620
You'll Jericho Cooper fucking suck
a little little Gehrig for you.

4113
01:47:37,830 --> 01:47:39,540
I just wonder if she can hold in still.

4114
01:47:39,570 --> 01:47:41,010
That's my only question I want to know.

4115
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:43,470
Cause you know she was getting
baseball bats up her pussy.

4116
01:47:43,471 --> 01:47:47,110
She no upper ass baseball bat
in her ass then she really,

4117
01:47:47,310 --> 01:47:48,143
yes.

4118
01:47:48,210 --> 01:47:48,480
Yeah.

4119
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:49,313
Was a bit,

4120
01:47:49,780 --> 01:47:50,613
it's cool.

4121
01:47:50,970 --> 01:47:54,690
There's a video of it and
it's just so weird to watch.

4122
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:55,111
It's like,

4123
01:47:55,111 --> 01:47:55,944
okay,

4124
01:47:56,100 --> 01:47:56,933
there you go.

4125
01:47:56,940 --> 01:47:57,780
That's babies don't,

4126
01:47:57,781 --> 01:47:58,860
they don't piss all over the place.

4127
01:47:58,861 --> 01:48:00,510
Like I guess you can still.

4128
01:48:00,530 --> 01:48:00,620
Yeah,

4129
01:48:00,620 --> 01:48:01,560
but that's an asshole.

4130
01:48:01,570 --> 01:48:03,210
Her baseball bat winning her asshole.

4131
01:48:03,270 --> 01:48:04,050
Right.

4132
01:48:04,050 --> 01:48:05,340
Why does he say it holds in terms of like,

4133
01:48:05,341 --> 01:48:06,810
I guess those muscles re you know,

4134
01:48:07,650 --> 01:48:08,221
I guess,

4135
01:48:08,221 --> 01:48:09,900
but people do have problems.

4136
01:48:09,901 --> 01:48:14,901
People that like engage in
those activities really do
have problems stretching

4137
01:48:15,001 --> 01:48:15,361
out their,

4138
01:48:15,361 --> 01:48:16,350
their anus muscles.

4139
01:48:16,830 --> 01:48:20,670
I can take a little bit of a finger
and I can't tell you anything else.

4140
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:21,780
I was uh,

4141
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:23,360
dating this chick and uh,

4142
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:28,430
her roommate had sex with her boyfriend
and he fucked her in the ass and uh,

4143
01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:34,760
her sphincter must've relaxed and she
shit on him while they were sleeping and

4144
01:48:34,770 --> 01:48:34,940
uh,

4145
01:48:34,940 --> 01:48:35,850
she shit the bed.

4146
01:48:36,090 --> 01:48:36,840
Oh Wow.

4147
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:38,130
Shit on his Dick a little bit.

4148
01:48:38,131 --> 01:48:39,390
I don't know it in any way.

4149
01:48:39,391 --> 01:48:40,920
He got up and you know,

4150
01:48:40,921 --> 01:48:41,280
it was like,

4151
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:42,113
ah,

4152
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:45,270
and the door slammed and the guy was
like standing in the hallway like this,

4153
01:48:47,470 --> 01:48:50,470
I'm never forgets for fuck this boy.

4154
01:48:50,490 --> 01:48:53,370
And you know the girl was
dating telling me what happened.

4155
01:48:53,371 --> 01:48:53,700
I'm like,

4156
01:48:53,700 --> 01:48:55,740
oh no shit in my mouth this year.

4157
01:48:55,741 --> 01:48:57,240
I told you that and that's horrible.

4158
01:48:57,540 --> 01:48:59,160
I know what happened.

4159
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:03,600
I was any girls out who was on ecstasy
for the first time and then she's

4160
01:49:03,610 --> 01:49:04,261
shutting my mouth.

4161
01:49:04,261 --> 01:49:06,750
Cause you can feel it like
you see that happening.

4162
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:10,050
You don't want an accidental one cause
that's not going to be a good one now.

4163
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:13,740
It wasn't solid either.

4164
01:49:13,741 --> 01:49:14,491
I think it would be preferred,

4165
01:49:14,491 --> 01:49:16,190
a solid one.

4166
01:49:16,191 --> 01:49:17,390
And there's something about a solid one.

4167
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:17,611
You're like,

4168
01:49:17,611 --> 01:49:17,791
hey,

4169
01:49:17,791 --> 01:49:18,870
this kind of looks like a fucking,

4170
01:49:18,871 --> 01:49:19,210
you know,

4171
01:49:19,210 --> 01:49:19,600
uh,

4172
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:19,880
uh,

4173
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:20,970
a smokestack.

4174
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:21,781
There's nothing cool about it,

4175
01:49:21,781 --> 01:49:23,520
but he's not a subject I'm really into.

4176
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:25,170
But there is a woman,

4177
01:49:25,171 --> 01:49:29,370
this German woman who does shit porn where
people shit on her and she's like the

4178
01:49:29,371 --> 01:49:30,480
queen of Shit Porn.

4179
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:31,651
Don't ask me how.

4180
01:49:31,651 --> 01:49:34,860
I know that somebody posted it on my
message board and I've followed a fucking

4181
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:36,570
all over link hole.

4182
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:39,780
I went from link to link the link till
I got to her site and watch some of her

4183
01:49:39,781 --> 01:49:40,614
videos.

4184
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:41,730

And

4189
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:52,280
it's just people shitting in her mouth
and she's covered in shit and it's she,

4190
01:49:52,330 --> 01:49:53,170
she eats it.

4191
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:53,830
Yeah.

4192
01:49:53,830 --> 01:49:55,800
I mean it's making me swallow like,

4193
01:49:57,350 --> 01:49:57,700
no,

4194
01:49:57,700 --> 01:49:57,941
no,

4195
01:49:57,941 --> 01:49:58,421
no,

4196
01:49:58,421 --> 01:49:59,090
throwing up.

4197
01:49:59,090 --> 01:49:59,440
Oh,

4198
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:03,250
it's making me a extra salivate
thinking about how disgusting it was.

4199
01:50:03,251 --> 01:50:06,170
But she was just eating logs that
were coming on his guys and guys,

4200
01:50:06,220 --> 01:50:07,090
ass guy,

4201
01:50:07,130 --> 01:50:08,050
shit's gotta be awful.

4202
01:50:08,051 --> 01:50:08,920
She says it's better.

4203
01:50:08,921 --> 01:50:11,110
She says it's spicier
cause many more meat.

4204
01:50:11,111 --> 01:50:12,670
And she was like explaining,

4205
01:50:12,690 --> 01:50:12,830
yeah,

4206
01:50:12,830 --> 01:50:14,350
I don't want to see what's a spicy log.

4207
01:50:14,570 --> 01:50:19,150
She's sitting there smoking cigarettes
explaining in German why she loves eating

4208
01:50:19,151 --> 01:50:19,541
shit.

4209
01:50:19,541 --> 01:50:20,230
And then she,

4210
01:50:20,230 --> 01:50:22,300
she's got a like a
stomach of a Billy goat.

4211
01:50:22,301 --> 01:50:26,050
She never gets sick and she feels
herself up with shit and that's great.

4212
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:26,521
But you know,

4213
01:50:26,521 --> 01:50:28,090
but this is like the things,

4214
01:50:28,150 --> 01:50:31,270
there's so many types of
people out there in this world.

4215
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:32,050
This,

4216
01:50:32,050 --> 01:50:33,640
there's no normal,

4217
01:50:33,790 --> 01:50:36,220
there's like expectations of normality.

4218
01:50:36,370 --> 01:50:37,720
There's like a spectrum.

4219
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:38,471
And they fought.

4220
01:50:38,471 --> 01:50:40,780
Most people fall into like this area,

4221
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:45,490
but there's enough people out there
that like watching her eat shit that she

4222
01:50:45,491 --> 01:50:46,780
makes a living eating shit.

4223
01:50:46,930 --> 01:50:48,400
She has a website [inaudible] shit.

4224
01:50:48,401 --> 01:50:49,660
She's a member section.

4225
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:51,370
She's famous for it.

4226
01:50:51,490 --> 01:50:52,450
They're interviewing her,

4227
01:50:52,451 --> 01:50:53,710
asking her questions.

4228
01:50:53,711 --> 01:50:54,790
They using a camera.

4229
01:50:54,791 --> 01:50:55,001
I mean,

4230
01:50:55,001 --> 01:50:56,290
it's like the whole deal.

4231
01:50:56,291 --> 01:50:57,520
It's like she's,

4232
01:50:57,880 --> 01:50:58,240

4233
01:50:58,240 --> 01:50:58,530
there's,

4234
01:50:58,530 --> 01:50:59,363
there's uh,

4235
01:50:59,390 --> 01:50:59,830
not,

4236
01:50:59,830 --> 01:51:03,220
it's not one person that likes
watching her eat shit as a whole group.

4237
01:51:03,250 --> 01:51:05,890
Well the funny thing is too that like
when you think like the fact that she

4238
01:51:05,891 --> 01:51:07,000
smokes on top of it,

4239
01:51:07,340 --> 01:51:11,260
like if there's anything that can make
your breath worse than fucking eating

4240
01:51:11,590 --> 01:51:16,360
some fucking to some Nazis logs
and having a cigarette afterwards.

4241
01:51:16,540 --> 01:51:19,570
Imagine how burps Shit,

4242
01:51:19,750 --> 01:51:20,590
cigarettes,

4243
01:51:20,591 --> 01:51:21,460
shit burps.

4244
01:51:21,490 --> 01:51:24,310
You craft services all
fucking coffee and tuna salad.

4245
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:25,570
Just really awful stuff.

4246
01:51:26,020 --> 01:51:26,400
God,

4247
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:27,233
I'm over here.

4248
01:51:29,310 --> 01:51:33,190
I am almost throwing up thinking
about this until I see her sneezes.

4249
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:35,650
Like I'm Brown.

4250
01:51:36,010 --> 01:51:36,551
Gray.

4251
01:51:36,551 --> 01:51:38,650
It's a little awful a spray.

4252
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,420
If you had like fiber,

4253
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:42,220
if you had like a
cheesecloth in front of her,

4254
01:51:42,230 --> 01:51:44,600
you could see she can make a roar shark.

4255
01:51:46,870 --> 01:51:47,290
Shit,

4256
01:51:47,290 --> 01:51:47,621
shit,

4257
01:51:47,621 --> 01:51:48,401
this probably not good.

4258
01:51:48,401 --> 01:51:48,641
Come on.

4259
01:51:48,641 --> 01:51:51,940
Remember when we were kids it was really
hard to find anything even remotely

4260
01:51:51,941 --> 01:51:52,690
fucked up.

4261
01:51:52,690 --> 01:51:53,141
Like did you,

4262
01:51:53,141 --> 01:51:53,741
when you were a kid,

4263
01:51:53,741 --> 01:51:54,600
did you see we're about,

4264
01:51:54,630 --> 01:51:55,390
I'm 46,

4265
01:51:55,390 --> 01:51:57,400
45 I'll be 46 in two days.

4266
01:51:57,430 --> 01:51:59,410
I'll be 47 in August.

4267
01:51:59,770 --> 01:52:00,401
Did you,

4268
01:52:00,401 --> 01:52:01,234
um,

4269
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:04,240
did you see barnyard Betty
and any of those things?

4270
01:52:04,570 --> 01:52:05,040
Uh,

4271
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:05,920
but yeah,

4272
01:52:05,921 --> 01:52:07,180
the animal fucking stuff.

4273
01:52:07,430 --> 01:52:07,690
Yeah,

4274
01:52:07,690 --> 01:52:08,430
sure.

4275
01:52:08,430 --> 01:52:13,430
It was a video and a buddy had it and
we went over to his house and watched it

4276
01:52:14,050 --> 01:52:17,380
and like one of us had to watch the
door cause it was in the basement.

4277
01:52:17,381 --> 01:52:21,640
We were hovering over the v one person
at the watch the door to let us know if

4278
01:52:21,641 --> 01:52:22,474
anybody was coming.

4279
01:52:22,750 --> 01:52:25,060
And then we were standing
in front of this VCR,

4280
01:52:25,061 --> 01:52:29,200
this TV with a VCR attach to watch
this really grainy video of this chick.

4281
01:52:29,201 --> 01:52:29,860
Like,

4282
01:52:29,860 --> 01:52:30,161
you know,

4283
01:52:30,161 --> 01:52:31,270
very mild.

4284
01:52:31,380 --> 01:52:32,213
Sure.

4285
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:34,000
Beastiality very mild,

4286
01:52:34,001 --> 01:52:35,080
like blowing a donkey.

4287
01:52:35,081 --> 01:52:36,070
Not aggressively.

4288
01:52:36,071 --> 01:52:37,180
Not really that into it.

4289
01:52:37,181 --> 01:52:37,630
You know,

4290
01:52:37,630 --> 01:52:42,490
she was having sex with a pig in some
weird way and a German shepherd and it was

4291
01:52:42,491 --> 01:52:43,301
kind of fucked,

4292
01:52:43,301 --> 01:52:46,310
but it was so mild in comparison

4293
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:47,780
to what kids see today.

4294
01:52:47,990 --> 01:52:51,320
Do you ever wonder what kind of
an impact that's having on them?

4295
01:52:52,180 --> 01:52:53,270
It's got to be freaking you out.

4296
01:52:53,271 --> 01:52:53,401
If you,

4297
01:52:53,401 --> 01:52:53,641
if you're,

4298
01:52:53,641 --> 01:52:54,120
if you're a,

4299
01:52:54,120 --> 01:52:56,360
like when I saw some
hardcore porn pictures,

4300
01:52:56,361 --> 01:52:57,260
the dirty movie,

4301
01:52:57,560 --> 01:52:59,760
but if you're just seeing
a beheading video or,

4302
01:52:59,830 --> 01:53:01,790
or legitimate car crash stuff,

4303
01:53:02,090 --> 01:53:06,050
or were hardcore fucking
is just the normalist thing
you're going to see online.

4304
01:53:06,110 --> 01:53:06,680
Like,

4305
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:06,891
yeah,

4306
01:53:06,891 --> 01:53:07,610
it's got a jade.

4307
01:53:07,610 --> 01:53:09,250
I think that's why maybe
school shooting that's,

4308
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:10,430
I'm not blaming video game,

4309
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:14,540
but when people be do become a
certain desensitized to things,

4310
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:15,170
um,

4311
01:53:15,170 --> 01:53:17,960
I probably sound like I'm criticizing
every message if ever given.

4312
01:53:17,961 --> 01:53:20,480
But I do think that that has
something to do with desensitizing you

4313
01:53:21,010 --> 01:53:22,180
to have something to do with it.

4314
01:53:22,181 --> 01:53:25,340
You can't say that that's the
cause or someone doing something,

4315
01:53:25,341 --> 01:53:28,570
a born some doing something
horrible and violent,

4316
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:33,070
but you see so much violence
and it becomes an option.

4317
01:53:33,190 --> 01:53:33,490
You know,

4318
01:53:33,490 --> 01:53:34,840
if he didn't know what a gun was,

4319
01:53:34,841 --> 01:53:35,800
he didn't know what,

4320
01:53:35,860 --> 01:53:36,101
you know,

4321
01:53:36,101 --> 01:53:37,150
a school shooting was.

4322
01:53:37,330 --> 01:53:38,030
If it didn't exist,

4323
01:53:38,030 --> 01:53:39,040
it wasn't on the table.

4324
01:53:39,250 --> 01:53:40,960
It wouldn't be something
that people considered,

4325
01:53:41,050 --> 01:53:41,381
you know.

4326
01:53:41,381 --> 01:53:43,390
But because the fact we have guns,

4327
01:53:43,391 --> 01:53:45,910
we know about guns because of the fact
that we know about school shootings,

4328
01:53:46,060 --> 01:53:46,541
people think,

4329
01:53:46,541 --> 01:53:46,991
you know what,

4330
01:53:46,991 --> 01:53:48,790
my fucking life is terrible.

4331
01:53:49,170 --> 01:53:50,890
I'm all fucked up on antidepressants.

4332
01:53:50,891 --> 01:53:52,000
I'm going to go shoot up my school.

4333
01:53:52,830 --> 01:53:53,040
You know,

4334
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:57,250
it is all those things do factor
into the possibility of someone doing

4335
01:53:57,251 --> 01:53:57,611
something.

4336
01:53:57,611 --> 01:53:59,860
But you can't blame those things.

4337
01:53:59,980 --> 01:54:04,690
It's like I've said that I think
that we have a gun problem,

4338
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:06,040
a mental health problem,

4339
01:54:06,041 --> 01:54:07,760
rather disguise as a gun problem.

4340
01:54:08,110 --> 01:54:10,570
That's what I think it is more than
anything because you can give a lot of

4341
01:54:10,571 --> 01:54:12,400
people guns and they would
never do anything wrong.

4342
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:13,231
Right.

4343
01:54:13,231 --> 01:54:13,921
But then he gave her that,

4344
01:54:13,921 --> 01:54:14,101
you know,

4345
01:54:14,101 --> 01:54:16,800
one fucking one one like
what was the kid that Alonza,

4346
01:54:17,310 --> 01:54:17,881
Alonza,

4347
01:54:17,881 --> 01:54:21,560
Adam Lanza Lanza would affect his name
was his mother had they got around the,

4348
01:54:21,610 --> 01:54:22,010
you know,

4349
01:54:22,010 --> 01:54:23,730
so even if you're not the crazy person,

4350
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:26,250
even if your kid is the fucking wide eyed,

4351
01:54:26,630 --> 01:54:27,620
you know me,

4352
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:27,901
me,

4353
01:54:27,901 --> 01:54:31,950
me shitbag that he was the fucking PW.

4354
01:54:31,951 --> 01:54:34,890
I hate the pupil in the middle of
the eye with white all around it.

4355
01:54:34,891 --> 01:54:36,030
And I know some people get mad at me,

4356
01:54:36,031 --> 01:54:37,230
but it's a real condition.

4357
01:54:37,260 --> 01:54:38,093
Got Up.

4358
01:54:38,160 --> 01:54:40,170
So sick of people getting upset there.

4359
01:54:40,171 --> 01:54:41,290
Shouldn't Jen move?

4360
01:54:42,120 --> 01:54:43,380
He had a weird pupil.

4361
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:43,890
Oh you,

4362
01:54:43,890 --> 01:54:44,041
no,

4363
01:54:44,041 --> 01:54:45,630
but I'm saying a lot of
the look in their eyes,

4364
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:47,080
Adderall ice.

4365
01:54:47,830 --> 01:54:49,730
I know somebody is on
Adderall is when you look at,

4366
01:54:49,750 --> 01:54:51,270
you can see the white around their Ibo.

4367
01:54:51,420 --> 01:54:51,840
You know,

4368
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:53,280
that's cause they're just like this.

4369
01:54:53,310 --> 01:54:53,690
Yeah.

4370
01:54:53,690 --> 01:54:55,170
Like oh I see what you're saying.

4371
01:54:55,210 --> 01:54:55,861
Some Wacko,

4372
01:54:55,861 --> 01:54:58,050
you can see that fucking
act like Garfield.

4373
01:55:00,110 --> 01:55:00,661
You know,

4374
01:55:00,661 --> 01:55:03,660
I'm sure plenty of people don't have
that aren't mentally ill who have that.

4375
01:55:03,661 --> 01:55:03,961
But the,

4376
01:55:03,961 --> 01:55:05,490
the nuts I've seen all have that.

4377
01:55:05,730 --> 01:55:07,370
Well Wa being wide eyed,

4378
01:55:07,420 --> 01:55:07,690
being

4379
01:55:07,690 --> 01:55:08,560
accelerated,

4380
01:55:08,561 --> 01:55:10,390
being on amphetamines or you know,

4381
01:55:10,391 --> 01:55:10,750
when you,

4382
01:55:10,750 --> 01:55:14,290
when you're putting kids on Ritalin and
you're putting kids on Adderall and all

4383
01:55:14,291 --> 01:55:14,741
these different,

4384
01:55:14,741 --> 01:55:15,700
those are stimulants.

4385
01:55:16,090 --> 01:55:16,391
You know,

4386
01:55:16,391 --> 01:55:19,180
one of the things that they
use to treat ADHD and add,

4387
01:55:19,181 --> 01:55:20,170
those are stimulants.

4388
01:55:20,710 --> 01:55:20,921
You know,

4389
01:55:20,921 --> 01:55:21,131
you're,

4390
01:55:21,131 --> 01:55:21,440
you're,

4391
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:23,890
you're jacking kids up on
all kinds of crazy shit.

4392
01:55:23,891 --> 01:55:24,610
And that's just,

4393
01:55:24,610 --> 01:55:25,810
that's just those things.

4394
01:55:25,811 --> 01:55:29,200
What about the things that they put him
on that or antidepressants and all these

4395
01:55:29,201 --> 01:55:33,910
things that don't have a long history
of where you're radically altering human

4396
01:55:33,911 --> 01:55:34,744
neurochemistry,

4397
01:55:34,780 --> 01:55:38,530
radically altering it on a daily
basis with really hardcore chemicals.

4398
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:41,250
That's the one thing that nobody likes
to talk about when it comes to these

4399
01:55:41,251 --> 01:55:42,250
schools shootings,

4400
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:43,233
you know the,

4401
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:44,191
you know,

4402
01:55:44,191 --> 01:55:48,400
not meet correlation of causation or
whatever the fuck that term is that that

4403
01:55:48,410 --> 01:55:50,100
you can't necessarily connect them.

4404
01:55:50,320 --> 01:55:50,700
You,

4405
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:54,210
you can necessarily connect them you
that you can't say it's the a hundred

4406
01:55:54,210 --> 01:55:54,960
percent of the cause,

4407
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:59,340
but when 90% of all the people that are
school shooters are on antidepressants

4408
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:02,760
or are coming off of antidepressants
suffering when withdrawal of

4409
01:56:02,761 --> 01:56:03,594
antidepressants,

4410
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:06,750
it wasn't point in time that they
start looking at these chemicals that

4411
01:56:06,751 --> 01:56:10,260
radically altered the way
people react to stress,

4412
01:56:10,350 --> 01:56:12,810
the way people react to life itself,

4413
01:56:12,811 --> 01:56:15,120
the way people react
to negative influences.

4414
01:56:15,330 --> 01:56:15,870
Like,

4415
01:56:15,870 --> 01:56:19,440
I had a friend that was on Zoloft
and she said that when she was on it,

4416
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:21,030
she didn't care about anything.

4417
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:22,820
Like she was going to write a book called,

4418
01:56:22,860 --> 01:56:27,270
I lost a year of my life about being on
Zoloft cause for a year nothing bothered

4419
01:56:27,271 --> 01:56:27,361
her,

4420
01:56:27,361 --> 01:56:28,194
nothing bothered her.

4421
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:31,020
And you would think that
someone who's a fucking psycho,

4422
01:56:31,050 --> 01:56:31,330
right.

4423
01:56:31,330 --> 01:56:32,370
You put them on that shit.

4424
01:56:32,550 --> 01:56:34,740
It's also not going to
bother them to kill people.

4425
01:56:34,890 --> 01:56:35,101
I mean,

4426
01:56:35,101 --> 01:56:36,390
just totally makes sense.

4427
01:56:36,580 --> 01:56:37,390
Right.

4428
01:56:37,390 --> 01:56:38,760
They went to [inaudible] as a kid,

4429
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:42,060
but my parents I think said no thank God,

4430
01:56:42,090 --> 01:56:43,560
they like me being creative.

4431
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:44,161
Yeah.

4432
01:56:44,161 --> 01:56:48,390
And the funny Mandy having a lot of
extra energy and anxiety that people can

4433
01:56:48,391 --> 01:56:49,410
misinterpret that as like,

4434
01:56:49,430 --> 01:56:49,591
oh,

4435
01:56:49,591 --> 01:56:52,110
we got to medicate this kid to
make them quote unquote normal.

4436
01:56:52,170 --> 01:56:52,321
Yeah.

4437
01:56:52,321 --> 01:56:52,921
Always a Weirdo.

4438
01:56:52,921 --> 01:56:53,250
I mean,

4439
01:56:53,250 --> 01:56:53,570
you know,

4440
01:56:53,570 --> 01:56:55,570
I was a little fucking Weirdo and,

4441
01:56:55,610 --> 01:56:57,270
but that's how you make a comedian.

4442
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:58,150
That is true.

4443
01:56:58,150 --> 01:56:58,470
Yes.

4444
01:56:58,470 --> 01:56:58,890
Nobody,

4445
01:56:58,890 --> 01:56:59,850
nobody brings that up,

4446
01:56:59,851 --> 01:57:00,151
you know?

4447
01:57:00,151 --> 01:57:00,431
No,

4448
01:57:00,431 --> 01:57:01,740
no one ever brings that up in school.

4449
01:57:01,741 --> 01:57:01,891
Like,

4450
01:57:01,891 --> 01:57:02,250
you know,

4451
01:57:02,250 --> 01:57:02,790
Jimmy,

4452
01:57:02,790 --> 01:57:03,650
the way you look like I,

4453
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:04,081
I,

4454
01:57:04,081 --> 01:57:04,741
there's a,

4455
01:57:04,741 --> 01:57:07,320
a gal who works at this
office that I go to.

4456
01:57:07,321 --> 01:57:08,280
That's very funny.

4457
01:57:08,281 --> 01:57:09,990
She's always saying really funny shit.

4458
01:57:10,230 --> 01:57:10,910
So I asked her to,

4459
01:57:10,910 --> 01:57:11,520
I go,

4460
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:11,791
I go,

4461
01:57:11,791 --> 01:57:12,960
how come you're not a comedian?

4462
01:57:13,140 --> 01:57:14,580
Have you ever thought
about being a comedian?

4463
01:57:14,850 --> 01:57:15,301
And she goes,

4464
01:57:15,301 --> 01:57:15,451
no.

4465
01:57:15,451 --> 01:57:15,661
I go,

4466
01:57:15,661 --> 01:57:15,961
you're,

4467
01:57:15,961 --> 01:57:16,800
you're a comedian.

4468
01:57:16,801 --> 01:57:17,730
You just never done it.

4469
01:57:18,030 --> 01:57:18,411
Like you've,

4470
01:57:18,411 --> 01:57:19,710
you've got all the traits,

4471
01:57:19,730 --> 01:57:20,130
right.

4472
01:57:20,130 --> 01:57:20,341
You know,

4473
01:57:20,341 --> 01:57:20,791
you're always,

4474
01:57:20,791 --> 01:57:21,870
you're quick with Whit,

4475
01:57:21,890 --> 01:57:23,190
you're always trying to make people laugh.

4476
01:57:23,310 --> 01:57:23,971
You're always like,

4477
01:57:23,971 --> 01:57:25,080
she says creative shit.

4478
01:57:25,081 --> 01:57:25,914
She's very funny.

4479
01:57:26,120 --> 01:57:26,281
Like,

4480
01:57:26,281 --> 01:57:26,730
why don't you,

4481
01:57:26,730 --> 01:57:27,730
why don't you become a QB?

4482
01:57:27,731 --> 01:57:28,590
You ever thought about it?

4483
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:29,220
She's like,

4484
01:57:29,220 --> 01:57:29,491
no.

4485
01:57:29,491 --> 01:57:30,324
I was like,

4486
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:31,351
think about it.

4487
01:57:31,351 --> 01:57:31,860
How old is she?

4488
01:57:31,860 --> 01:57:33,720
28 not too late.

4489
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:36,180
You were 38 I'll tell you to give it up.

4490
01:57:36,240 --> 01:57:36,810
Yeah.

4491
01:57:36,810 --> 01:57:38,670
28 you can still to kill Tony.

4492
01:57:38,671 --> 01:57:39,504
I'll put her up.

4493
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:40,590
I don't think she's ready.

4494
01:57:41,130 --> 01:57:41,441
You know,

4495
01:57:41,441 --> 01:57:43,980
I mean you plant seeds like that and
someone said and who knows what they're

4496
01:57:43,981 --> 01:57:44,814
going to take.

4497
01:57:44,850 --> 01:57:49,440
But there's a lot of people out there
that that is what they could do and they

4498
01:57:49,441 --> 01:57:50,730
probably have a skill.

4499
01:57:50,731 --> 01:57:52,140
They probably have a talent rather,

4500
01:57:52,141 --> 01:57:55,260
and they just never been a encouraged
don't when he encourages you to do that.

4501
01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:55,670
Yeah.

4502
01:57:55,670 --> 01:57:58,890
Cause any guidance counselor ever said
to a kid he should be a standup comic.

4503
01:57:59,270 --> 01:58:00,180
You like doing drugs.

4504
01:58:00,330 --> 01:58:00,600
Look,

4505
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:01,800
you'd never show up on time.

4506
01:58:02,370 --> 01:58:03,570
You don't do your homework.

4507
01:58:03,930 --> 01:58:04,763
You're funny.

4508
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:05,700
Go be a comic.

4509
01:58:05,700 --> 01:58:05,851
Yeah.

4510
01:58:05,851 --> 01:58:07,650
They never encourage
you to get in the city.

4511
01:58:07,651 --> 01:58:07,951
Right.

4512
01:58:07,951 --> 01:58:08,101
You know,

4513
01:58:08,101 --> 01:58:08,641
if your music,

4514
01:58:08,641 --> 01:58:10,010
they encourage you to take me as a class.

4515
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:12,720
Well they probably gets here to that
part of the arts and drama alone.

4516
01:58:12,780 --> 01:58:17,400
Take a class and see if your standup
comedy is one of the least respected art

4517
01:58:17,401 --> 01:58:18,570
forms that's most loved.

4518
01:58:18,660 --> 01:58:19,350
Yeah.

4519
01:58:19,350 --> 01:58:22,800
As far as like the process of
becoming a standup comedian,

4520
01:58:22,801 --> 01:58:27,801
the option of becoming a
standup convenient is so
often like my own parents.

4521
01:58:28,320 --> 01:58:31,590
My parents didn't have a
hard time with me kickboxing,

4522
01:58:32,310 --> 01:58:35,970
but they didn't want me
to do comedy doing comedy.

4523
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,110
Like you're not funny.

4524
01:58:37,111 --> 01:58:38,100
This is going to be terrible.

4525
01:58:38,540 --> 01:58:38,730
Yeah.

4526
01:58:38,730 --> 01:58:41,010
There's something intangible about
a comment that just scares people.

4527
01:58:41,110 --> 01:58:41,261
Well,

4528
01:58:41,261 --> 01:58:42,010
they feel like you're going to be

4529
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:42,490
a loser,

4530
01:58:42,490 --> 01:58:43,600
you're going to be a loser,

4531
01:58:43,601 --> 01:58:44,030
you're acting.

4532
01:58:44,030 --> 01:58:46,120
Cause no one wants to
be the one who bombs.

4533
01:58:46,420 --> 01:58:50,020
And just to see someone you love up
there making an ass out of themselves and

4534
01:58:50,021 --> 01:58:51,790
not be in funny like,

4535
01:58:51,820 --> 01:58:52,180
oh,

4536
01:58:52,180 --> 01:58:56,140
how awful it did for a girl to go out
with a guy she's dating who consistently

4537
01:58:56,141 --> 01:58:57,400
sucks on stage.

4538
01:58:57,910 --> 01:58:58,540
That's gotta be,

4539
01:58:58,540 --> 01:59:00,490
that's just kind of make
her not want to fuck him.

4540
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:01,630
I'll for sure awful.

4541
01:59:01,660 --> 01:59:01,811
Well,

4542
01:59:01,811 --> 01:59:03,640
I've brought dates to shows and I bombed.

4543
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:04,150
Yes.

4544
01:59:04,150 --> 01:59:04,601
Feel it.

4545
01:59:04,601 --> 01:59:06,160
They just didn't want to
have nothing to do with me.

4546
01:59:06,580 --> 01:59:07,660
Can feel it.

4547
01:59:08,550 --> 01:59:08,861
You know,

4548
01:59:08,861 --> 01:59:10,140
back in the day when,

4549
01:59:10,141 --> 01:59:11,110
when I first started,

4550
01:59:11,111 --> 01:59:11,950
I could have bombed,

4551
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:13,360
I wouldn't have a good set,

4552
01:59:13,690 --> 01:59:14,140
you know,

4553
01:59:14,140 --> 01:59:18,460
maybe three to three sets in a row and
then every fourth or fifth set easily can

4554
01:59:18,461 --> 01:59:20,030
go into the toilet easily.

4555
01:59:20,410 --> 01:59:23,620
So you take a girl with you to a
show boy that was taking a risk.

4556
01:59:23,650 --> 01:59:24,401
I never do it.

4557
01:59:24,401 --> 01:59:25,234
I mean now I'll do it,

4558
01:59:25,420 --> 01:59:26,201
come see you to sell it,

4559
01:59:26,201 --> 01:59:28,570
but I'm working on stuff or whatever
on the nights that I'm there.

4560
01:59:28,571 --> 01:59:30,490
I hate bringing people to shows,

4561
01:59:30,550 --> 01:59:33,610
especially when you're working on stuff
because when you working on stuff,

4562
01:59:33,611 --> 01:59:37,360
you're not trying to do the best show
as much as you're trying to get material

4563
01:59:37,540 --> 01:59:40,480
and like format and get it to get
and you'll sacrifice a few minutes.

4564
01:59:40,510 --> 01:59:41,180
Oh yeah.

4565
01:59:41,180 --> 01:59:41,890
I mean I,

4566
01:59:41,890 --> 01:59:44,510
I worked on a new bit
last night and I just,

4567
01:59:44,620 --> 01:59:45,250
I knew,

4568
01:59:45,250 --> 01:59:45,611
I'm like,

4569
01:59:45,611 --> 01:59:46,391
while I'm doing this,

4570
01:59:46,391 --> 01:59:46,810
I'm like,

4571
01:59:46,810 --> 01:59:49,660
this is virgin territory
is completely new bit.

4572
01:59:49,810 --> 01:59:51,010
I don't know where it's going.

4573
01:59:51,880 --> 01:59:53,230
And if someone was there to see you,

4574
01:59:53,231 --> 01:59:54,700
who knows how you're
going to pull out of that,

4575
01:59:54,701 --> 01:59:55,630
you might not pull out.

4576
01:59:55,630 --> 01:59:56,080
Well,

4577
01:59:56,080 --> 01:59:56,710
yeah.

4578
01:59:56,710 --> 01:59:56,951
So I,

4579
01:59:56,951 --> 01:59:58,150
I warned them though and I'm like,

4580
01:59:58,151 --> 02:00:00,400
it's going to by that clear
my throat because the butter,

4581
02:00:00,660 --> 02:00:01,031
it's fuck,

4582
02:00:01,031 --> 02:00:01,451
I love it,

4583
02:00:01,451 --> 02:00:04,900
but it makes me fucking sound like
fucking Ian Watkins on the stand.

4584
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:05,111
Yeah.

4585
02:00:05,111 --> 02:00:07,340
It's probably not the best
thing to serve people a show.

4586
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:08,260
They talk for three hours.

4587
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:08,860
No,

4588
02:00:08,860 --> 02:00:09,940
he'd have some cottage cheese.

4589
02:00:09,970 --> 02:00:10,421
Goggle it,

4590
02:00:10,421 --> 02:00:11,740
this and then talk for three hours.

4591
02:00:12,820 --> 02:00:13,600
Fuck it.

4592
02:00:13,600 --> 02:00:13,720
I'll,

4593
02:00:13,720 --> 02:00:14,291
can I be fun?

4594
02:00:14,291 --> 02:00:14,981
I'm going to forget.

4595
02:00:14,981 --> 02:00:15,814
Can I plug my show?

4596
02:00:15,830 --> 02:00:16,540
But I keep it,

4597
02:00:16,540 --> 02:00:17,400
I'm really bad at that.

4598
02:00:17,410 --> 02:00:18,071
Please plugs.

4599
02:00:18,071 --> 02:00:19,060
I can't do it naturally,

4600
02:00:19,061 --> 02:00:20,500
so I have to just stop
the flow of everything.

4601
02:00:21,430 --> 02:00:22,150
Plug whore.

4602
02:00:22,150 --> 02:00:22,983
People want to hear it.

4603
02:00:23,410 --> 02:00:24,760
I'm doing a talk show and vice,

4604
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:25,230
ah,

4605
02:00:25,230 --> 02:00:26,760
which is why I'm out in
Los Angeles right now.

4606
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:28,870
And it comes out next Wednesday,

4607
02:00:28,871 --> 02:00:30,280
the 23rd.

4608
02:00:30,730 --> 02:00:31,450
Um,

4609
02:00:31,450 --> 02:00:31,750
you know,

4610
02:00:31,750 --> 02:00:33,640
it's a talk show that
I host and what is it?

4611
02:00:33,850 --> 02:00:38,850
It's just me doing a monologue
and a little sketch and
then interviewing guests.

4612
02:00:39,220 --> 02:00:41,890
And my first guests were actually
Dana and Mike Tyson together.

4613
02:00:42,070 --> 02:00:42,903
Wow.

4614
02:00:43,240 --> 02:00:44,200
What a fucking favor.

4615
02:00:44,210 --> 02:00:45,031
Dana did me mad.

4616
02:00:45,031 --> 02:00:45,820
And that's a Tyson.

4617
02:00:45,820 --> 02:00:46,031
Yeah,

4618
02:00:46,031 --> 02:00:46,690
they were great.

4619
02:00:46,690 --> 02:00:48,940
They were really great.

4620
02:00:48,941 --> 02:00:50,080
And just do it in front of an audience.

4621
02:00:50,350 --> 02:00:52,570
Live audience where I'm in New York.

4622
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:53,020
Wow.

4623
02:00:53,020 --> 02:00:55,330
We did four pilot episodes and uh,

4624
02:00:55,331 --> 02:00:55,780
it was,

4625
02:00:55,780 --> 02:00:58,840
it was a very odd thing because I wanted
the crowd on top of me like they're lay

4626
02:00:58,900 --> 02:01:01,450
audiences like from where
you are to me on top.

4627
02:01:01,451 --> 02:01:03,430
Like I wanted it like comedian style.

4628
02:01:03,670 --> 02:01:04,380
So uh,

4629
02:01:04,380 --> 02:01:05,560
the camera angles where they had to,

4630
02:01:05,561 --> 02:01:05,641
we,

4631
02:01:05,641 --> 02:01:08,620
it was hard for us to edit anything
because it was supposed to be a 30 minute

4632
02:01:08,621 --> 02:01:09,430
show,

4633
02:01:09,430 --> 02:01:12,670
but I want to talk to these guys who
wouldn't like an hour and 20 so we had to

4634
02:01:12,671 --> 02:01:13,630
chop down to an hour.

4635
02:01:13,630 --> 02:01:18,630
They let me make it an hour pilot episode
for vice.com or is it vice.com so it's

4636
02:01:19,331 --> 02:01:20,290
all going to be online.

4637
02:01:20,330 --> 02:01:20,470
Yeah.

4638
02:01:20,470 --> 02:01:20,800
Yeah.

4639
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:21,221
Beautiful.

4640
02:01:21,221 --> 02:01:24,460
It comes out to the 23rd and then there's
going to be one a week for four weeks

4641
02:01:24,461 --> 02:01:27,890
and hopefully people like the
different shows and you know,

4642
02:01:27,910 --> 02:01:29,950
the monologues I'm allowed to
kind of say what I want to say.

4643
02:01:29,951 --> 02:01:31,810
They didn't creatively
fuck with me at all.

4644
02:01:31,811 --> 02:01:32,890
Like that's awesome man.

4645
02:01:33,100 --> 02:01:33,940
They were great.

4646
02:01:33,941 --> 02:01:35,230
I mean everywhere you go,

4647
02:01:35,231 --> 02:01:37,660
they're telling you don't say this and
you know he's afraid of frustrating for a

4648
02:01:37,661 --> 02:01:38,260
comedian.

4649
02:01:38,260 --> 02:01:38,411
Well,

4650
02:01:38,411 --> 02:01:40,550
Shane Smith is one of
my favorite people ever.

4651
02:01:41,010 --> 02:01:41,841
I just love him.

4652
02:01:41,841 --> 02:01:42,960
He's the absolute fucking Adam.

4653
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:43,380
Yeah,

4654
02:01:43,380 --> 02:01:46,130
he sent me a fucking were
going back and forth.

4655
02:01:46,131 --> 02:01:46,761
He was texting me,

4656
02:01:46,761 --> 02:01:48,230
trying to get me to go to Africa with him.

4657
02:01:48,740 --> 02:01:49,131
I was like,

4658
02:01:49,131 --> 02:01:49,401
bitch,

4659
02:01:49,401 --> 02:01:50,480
are you out of your fucking mind?

4660
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:55,040
He wants me to go to some new island
that some island rather that they have

4661
02:01:55,041 --> 02:01:57,830
where they've taken all
these monkeys and apes.

4662
02:01:57,950 --> 02:02:02,150
They experimented with and shot up with
diseases and aids and all this stuff and

4663
02:02:02,151 --> 02:02:04,450
they've dropped them off when they're
done with their experiment and they,

4664
02:02:04,530 --> 02:02:06,050
they bring them to some island.

4665
02:02:06,350 --> 02:02:07,310
So there's an island,

4666
02:02:07,311 --> 02:02:11,600
like a planet of the apes island that's
filled with all these monkeys and apes

4667
02:02:11,601 --> 02:02:13,520
that have gone through all
these medical experiments.

4668
02:02:13,700 --> 02:02:14,900
He wanted me to go there with him.

4669
02:02:15,230 --> 02:02:16,040
I'm like,

4670
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:18,110
that is the last place I'm going,

4671
02:02:18,111 --> 02:02:18,944
man.

4672
02:02:18,950 --> 02:02:23,750
If you want me to go to The Bahamas and
drink my ties with Anthony Bordain I'm

4673
02:02:23,751 --> 02:02:24,584
in.

4674
02:02:24,680 --> 02:02:25,131
I'm not,

4675
02:02:25,131 --> 02:02:27,410
I'm not going to an AIDS
infected monkey island.

4676
02:02:27,430 --> 02:02:27,551
Yeah.

4677
02:02:27,551 --> 02:02:29,180
How about Shane invites you somewhere fun?

4678
02:02:29,220 --> 02:02:29,340
Yeah.

4679
02:02:29,340 --> 02:02:30,460
Like you want to like get blown.

4680
02:02:30,461 --> 02:02:31,070
All right.

4681
02:02:31,070 --> 02:02:33,790
He doesn't want to go anywhere
and everywhere you go places,

4682
02:02:33,950 --> 02:02:34,910
let's go to the Ukraine.

4683
02:02:34,910 --> 02:02:36,380
Fuck you.

4684
02:02:36,410 --> 02:02:37,340
Let's go to North Korea.

4685
02:02:37,490 --> 02:02:37,940
Eh,

4686
02:02:37,940 --> 02:02:38,930
not happening,

4687
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:39,201
dude.

4688
02:02:39,201 --> 02:02:40,530
He's the one that interviewed uh,

4689
02:02:40,580 --> 02:02:42,110
a fucking general butt naked.

4690
02:02:42,530 --> 02:02:42,831
I'm like,

4691
02:02:42,831 --> 02:02:43,970
what are you doing?

4692
02:02:43,971 --> 02:02:44,271
They're like,

4693
02:02:44,271 --> 02:02:45,470
send another guy.

4694
02:02:45,530 --> 02:02:46,363
No,

4695
02:02:46,730 --> 02:02:47,960
he's gangster as fuck.

4696
02:02:48,230 --> 02:02:49,070
He gets dirty.

4697
02:02:49,190 --> 02:02:49,431
Yeah,

4698
02:02:49,431 --> 02:02:50,091
he really does.

4699
02:02:50,091 --> 02:02:50,421
And it's like,

4700
02:02:50,421 --> 02:02:54,350
I don't think there's anybody on top of
a company of that size that is going to

4701
02:02:54,351 --> 02:02:55,071
those places.

4702
02:02:55,071 --> 02:02:56,270
I'm hoping he stops doing that.

4703
02:02:56,300 --> 02:02:57,410
He's not going to stop doing it.

4704
02:02:57,530 --> 02:02:58,280
He's in the group.

4705
02:02:58,280 --> 02:02:59,900
He was somewhere crazy the other day.

4706
02:02:59,901 --> 02:03:01,160
He was like in the Ukraine or something.

4707
02:03:01,430 --> 02:03:02,360
He doesn't give a fuck.

4708
02:03:02,470 --> 02:03:02,790
Yeah.

4709
02:03:02,790 --> 02:03:06,200
It goes to all those places and it's a
part of his life and he comes back with a

4710
02:03:06,201 --> 02:03:07,160
fucking burden,

4711
02:03:07,161 --> 02:03:07,700
bro.

4712
02:03:07,700 --> 02:03:11,540
He's come straight from the airport
right here and started drinking and we've

4713
02:03:11,541 --> 02:03:12,930
done podcast together and it's,

4714
02:03:12,950 --> 02:03:15,080
you could feel the burden on him,

4715
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:15,771
you know,

4716
02:03:15,771 --> 02:03:16,604
like,

4717
02:03:16,610 --> 02:03:16,851
yeah.

4718
02:03:16,851 --> 02:03:17,481
What does that I,

4719
02:03:17,481 --> 02:03:18,081
this is Jim's,

4720
02:03:18,081 --> 02:03:18,914
uh,

4721
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:19,191
oh,

4722
02:03:19,191 --> 02:03:20,024
play this,

4723
02:03:20,630 --> 02:03:21,300
play this.

4724
02:03:21,300 --> 02:03:22,140
I liked the problem.

4725
02:03:22,220 --> 02:03:22,960
I don't like,

4726
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:23,511
I like,

4727
02:03:23,511 --> 02:03:23,691
I'm,

4728
02:03:23,691 --> 02:03:23,961
hi,

4729
02:03:23,961 --> 02:03:24,794
I'm Jim Norton.

4730
02:03:24,830 --> 02:03:27,110
Be sure to watch my brand new show on vice

4731
02:03:33,390 --> 02:03:34,223
next.

4732
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:39,960
Great.

4733
02:03:39,960 --> 02:03:41,260
How could you got like that?

4734
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:41,830
You like it.

4735
02:03:41,830 --> 02:03:42,663
Okay.

4736
02:03:42,830 --> 02:03:43,351
Thank you.

4737
02:03:43,351 --> 02:03:43,580
I,

4738
02:03:43,580 --> 02:03:44,850
those are legit laugh.

4739
02:03:44,870 --> 02:03:44,991
I,

4740
02:03:44,991 --> 02:03:45,370
I,

4741
02:03:45,370 --> 02:03:45,640
I,

4742
02:03:45,640 --> 02:03:45,960
uh,

4743
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:46,270
I,

4744
02:03:46,270 --> 02:03:49,170
I called the Best Expression
Collin everyday was shame spiral.

4745
02:03:49,171 --> 02:03:50,220
I can't watch myself.

4746
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:51,091
I ever,

4747
02:03:51,091 --> 02:03:52,110
I can't watch myself.

4748
02:03:52,111 --> 02:03:53,430
Like I get fucking humiliating,

4749
02:03:53,431 --> 02:03:55,170
but that's one of the reasons
why you're really good.

4750
02:03:55,590 --> 02:03:56,011
You know,

4751
02:03:56,011 --> 02:03:56,491
it's hard.

4752
02:03:56,491 --> 02:03:57,810
I don't like watching myself either.

4753
02:03:57,811 --> 02:03:58,580
It's,

4754
02:03:58,580 --> 02:03:59,130
you know,

4755
02:03:59,130 --> 02:04:02,670
it's whenever I sit down on a radio
show like they used to do it on k rock,

4756
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:04,280
every time I would do it I would sit down,

4757
02:04:04,300 --> 02:04:08,370
they would play this whole thing of a
bunch of clips in my stand up and then add

4758
02:04:08,371 --> 02:04:09,121
a context.

4759
02:04:09,121 --> 02:04:12,360
Just punchlines like stop
making me uncomfortable.

4760
02:04:12,580 --> 02:04:13,350
Stop it,

4761
02:04:13,350 --> 02:04:14,160
don't do it,

4762
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:14,993
don't play it.

4763
02:04:15,060 --> 02:04:16,770
He just made me feel a
lot better than thank you.

4764
02:04:16,771 --> 02:04:17,610
Cause that was spent all day.

4765
02:04:17,611 --> 02:04:19,250
I was panicking about that promo going on.

4766
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:19,770
I'm like,

4767
02:04:19,770 --> 02:04:20,640
nobody's going to laugh at it.

4768
02:04:21,090 --> 02:04:22,170
I take it a promo.

4769
02:04:22,280 --> 02:04:23,370
I have been mixed.

4770
02:04:24,720 --> 02:04:26,250
I did another promo with fucking with,

4771
02:04:26,251 --> 02:04:29,820
with with Tyson and of course Dana is
in it and I'm like that one I felt more

4772
02:04:29,821 --> 02:04:31,560
secure with because this was just me.

4773
02:04:31,561 --> 02:04:32,430
I'm like no one will like it.

4774
02:04:32,440 --> 02:04:33,210
Like great.

4775
02:04:33,210 --> 02:04:33,691
Thank you Joe.

4776
02:04:33,691 --> 02:04:35,580
That made me feel a lot sacral
naked in the background.

4777
02:04:35,581 --> 02:04:36,570
It's hard to say cause the TVS,

4778
02:04:36,630 --> 02:04:36,810
no,

4779
02:04:36,810 --> 02:04:37,643
she a Bra.

4780
02:04:37,780 --> 02:04:42,720
Our connection is we have to fix that
and make it sticky to the TV color

4781
02:04:42,721 --> 02:04:43,061
broadly.

4782
02:04:43,061 --> 02:04:43,800
It's Kinda hard to say.

4783
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:44,780
It looks like she's naked.

4784
02:04:44,781 --> 02:04:45,240
It was fun.

4785
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:45,601
Whatever.

4786
02:04:45,601 --> 02:04:46,910
It is fucking hilarious.

4787
02:04:46,930 --> 02:04:50,270
I made me feel a lot better if
I was really genuinely panicked.

4788
02:04:50,430 --> 02:04:50,641
Look,

4789
02:04:50,641 --> 02:04:51,480
I'm a child,

4790
02:04:51,510 --> 02:04:53,160
I'm a fan of people throwing up.

4791
02:04:53,490 --> 02:04:55,170
I hosted fear factor for six years.

4792
02:04:55,171 --> 02:04:56,670
Throwing up to me was always funny.

4793
02:04:56,910 --> 02:04:57,570
It is right?

4794
02:04:57,570 --> 02:04:58,890
It is kind of for me.

4795
02:04:59,040 --> 02:04:59,490
Yeah,

4796
02:04:59,490 --> 02:04:59,850
I dunno.

4797
02:04:59,850 --> 02:05:01,890
I mean just the ridiculousness of it all.

4798
02:05:01,891 --> 02:05:03,150
You sitting on the edge of the bed,

4799
02:05:03,160 --> 02:05:07,110
her throwing up in a bucket
I'm in and I'll say this,

4800
02:05:07,170 --> 02:05:09,240
they eddy Moretti and knows and he's like,

4801
02:05:09,241 --> 02:05:09,361
no,

4802
02:05:09,361 --> 02:05:10,830
I think that's the best
one we should lead with.

4803
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:11,821
And I was against it.

4804
02:05:11,821 --> 02:05:12,031
I was like,

4805
02:05:12,031 --> 02:05:12,301
no,

4806
02:05:12,301 --> 02:05:12,901
I don't think so.

4807
02:05:12,901 --> 02:05:14,070
And it's like sometimes people just,

4808
02:05:14,071 --> 02:05:17,370
I have to remember that there are people
that see things from the outside that

4809
02:05:17,371 --> 02:05:17,520
are,

4810
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:21,390
that are no shit that I don't know
and have a better eye than I do.

4811
02:05:21,720 --> 02:05:22,321
And it's like,

4812
02:05:22,321 --> 02:05:23,610
you know how you're married to your stuff,

4813
02:05:23,611 --> 02:05:23,851
man,

4814
02:05:23,851 --> 02:05:25,080
when you're performing or whatever.

4815
02:05:25,350 --> 02:05:28,740
And it's like there's people that can
just see things and detach from the

4816
02:05:28,741 --> 02:05:30,910
emotion of it and go to
clearly like now though,

4817
02:05:30,930 --> 02:05:32,010
this is the way to start.

4818
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:34,410
Like I was wrong about that
and he was right and it's like,

4819
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:37,470
it's really hard for me to think in those
terms that I don't know what the fuck

4820
02:05:37,471 --> 02:05:38,304
I'm always talking about.

4821
02:05:38,310 --> 02:05:39,180
It's hard to,

4822
02:05:39,181 --> 02:05:40,990
when you're going over your material,

4823
02:05:40,991 --> 02:05:42,750
when you're editing like a special,

4824
02:05:42,870 --> 02:05:45,540
you lose the idea of what's
funny and what's not funny.

4825
02:05:45,541 --> 02:05:47,340
You see the bits too
many times and could get,

4826
02:05:47,610 --> 02:05:52,200
they get really blurry sometimes it
gets real confusing and you get a fan.

4827
02:05:52,230 --> 02:05:53,760
I'm a very bad collaborator.

4828
02:05:54,030 --> 02:05:54,930
Like we had to edit the,

4829
02:05:54,931 --> 02:05:55,141
the,

4830
02:05:55,141 --> 02:05:55,920
the interview with,

4831
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:59,760
with Dana and Mike and I loved all of it
cause it was honest and funny and free

4832
02:05:59,761 --> 02:06:00,511
flowing and you know,

4833
02:06:00,511 --> 02:06:05,040
Tyson was hilarious and Dana was fucking
great and it was like we had to chop,

4834
02:06:05,041 --> 02:06:06,990
it just cannot 40 minute
cause I went 40 minutes.

4835
02:06:06,991 --> 02:06:08,250
So it's the internet,

4836
02:06:08,580 --> 02:06:11,460
but they way that they're letting me do
it was they've already doubled how long

4837
02:06:11,461 --> 02:06:12,240
they'll let me do it.

4838
02:06:12,240 --> 02:06:15,570
I'm okay with that and a lot and some
that was just literally we were throwing

4839
02:06:15,571 --> 02:06:15,841
too.

4840
02:06:15,841 --> 02:06:19,080
We had to do a couple of throws cause
the way vice releases a video is they'll

4841
02:06:19,081 --> 02:06:20,340
have more than one part to it.

4842
02:06:20,690 --> 02:06:22,200
They just masters at that shit.

4843
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:23,940
So I forgot to do that.

4844
02:06:24,220 --> 02:06:26,340
I during the interview I didn't do that.

4845
02:06:26,341 --> 02:06:26,930
So we had to guard,

4846
02:06:26,930 --> 02:06:29,100
we just got to get a couple
of pickups which we needed.

4847
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:30,991
So we had to get like,

4848
02:06:30,991 --> 02:06:31,201
all right,

4849
02:06:31,201 --> 02:06:31,741
we'll be right back,

4850
02:06:31,741 --> 02:06:32,490
watch this.

4851
02:06:32,490 --> 02:06:35,760
So we had to tape them at the end and
they were doing that and we're talking

4852
02:06:35,761 --> 02:06:36,301
about something.

4853
02:06:36,301 --> 02:06:37,470
But the one we're talking about,

4854
02:06:38,150 --> 02:06:38,760
um,

4855
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:40,330
I had to take this pickup
and put it in the middle.

4856
02:06:40,360 --> 02:06:41,940
Just a couple of minor things.

4857
02:06:42,150 --> 02:06:44,010
But I got so fucking
territorial about stuff.

4858
02:06:44,011 --> 02:06:45,090
You don't want to cut any of it.

4859
02:06:45,420 --> 02:06:47,610
But they were actually great when they
didn't bust my balls about any of the

4860
02:06:47,611 --> 02:06:48,450
content at all.

4861
02:06:48,510 --> 02:06:52,620
I don't understand wanting to edit
things that are on the Internet if it,

4862
02:06:52,621 --> 02:06:54,060
unless it's some insane length.

4863
02:06:54,450 --> 02:06:56,010
This was just the,

4864
02:06:56,070 --> 02:06:56,791
the cuts we made,

4865
02:06:56,791 --> 02:06:59,010
there was very little in the content area.

4866
02:06:59,340 --> 02:07:01,950
It was only because I didn't
know how they did videos.

4867
02:07:02,190 --> 02:07:04,680
Like I didn't realize that we have
to do it in more than one part.

4868
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:05,990
And they probably had told me that,

4869
02:07:05,991 --> 02:07:08,640
and I just forgot in that moment
because it was my first episode.

4870
02:07:09,090 --> 02:07:12,600
So I should have said like what I should
have done was to keep in pace with the

4871
02:07:12,601 --> 02:07:14,850
way they do is because every
series they do is really,

4872
02:07:14,851 --> 02:07:15,720
I've watched a million up,

4873
02:07:15,750 --> 02:07:17,040
they're all released in a few parts.

4874
02:07:17,400 --> 02:07:18,300
So if I'm going along,

4875
02:07:18,301 --> 02:07:18,781
I should have said,

4876
02:07:18,781 --> 02:07:19,081
all right,

4877
02:07:19,081 --> 02:07:20,040
it's about x amount of time,

4878
02:07:20,310 --> 02:07:21,780
we'll be right back or go to the next,

4879
02:07:21,781 --> 02:07:24,390
whatever the fuck I should have
said and then done it that way.

4880
02:07:24,690 --> 02:07:26,430
But I just didn't know to do that.

4881
02:07:26,431 --> 02:07:27,580
So you know what I think,

4882
02:07:27,600 --> 02:07:29,220
I think that's the wrong way to do it.

4883
02:07:29,221 --> 02:07:31,380
I think the way you did
it as the right way,

4884
02:07:31,590 --> 02:07:31,921
dude,

4885
02:07:31,921 --> 02:07:36,460
organically have a conversation and
then have all the throws in post.

4886
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:39,010
What do you have to fucking
be there when you do it?

4887
02:07:39,220 --> 02:07:40,150
Just say you know,

4888
02:07:40,151 --> 02:07:41,430
having the middle of the coffee,

4889
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:42,850
like the conversations have pauses.

4890
02:07:42,970 --> 02:07:47,020
Say we'll be back with episode
two next week and we can do that.

4891
02:07:47,050 --> 02:07:47,711
Why not?

4892
02:07:47,711 --> 02:07:52,600
Why would you want to make someone have
some nonorganic throw in the middle of a

4893
02:07:52,601 --> 02:07:53,470
conversation.

4894
02:07:53,680 --> 02:07:54,670
Like that's goofy.

4895
02:07:54,750 --> 02:07:58,810
That's just chops up the flow of the
conversation in the thought process.

4896
02:07:58,811 --> 02:08:01,090
That may have been my mistake.

4897
02:08:01,091 --> 02:08:03,790
Then you don't need to
like they know how to,

4898
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,810
the thing that they do
is they release video.

4899
02:08:05,811 --> 02:08:07,070
They know what gets the views.

4900
02:08:07,080 --> 02:08:08,440
The part one's the part two.

4901
02:08:08,441 --> 02:08:11,260
He's like they tried to explaining it
to me like how it works as a business

4902
02:08:11,261 --> 02:08:14,260
model and you know I'm
looking at it from like,

4903
02:08:14,290 --> 02:08:14,951
like you just said,

4904
02:08:14,951 --> 02:08:19,630
I want to have the conversation and
they were like things don't normally go

4905
02:08:19,631 --> 02:08:21,100
cause my set's very plain.

4906
02:08:21,101 --> 02:08:21,401
I like,

4907
02:08:21,401 --> 02:08:23,020
I like the Dick Cavett Mike Douglas,

4908
02:08:23,021 --> 02:08:24,070
like those fucking guys.

4909
02:08:24,850 --> 02:08:26,320
So I did it because I,

4910
02:08:26,350 --> 02:08:26,860
you know,

4911
02:08:26,860 --> 02:08:27,780
they're not going to just,

4912
02:08:27,790 --> 02:08:28,391
I should have just said,

4913
02:08:28,391 --> 02:08:28,691
hey look,

4914
02:08:28,691 --> 02:08:31,030
we'll be right back or
maybe done it in post,

4915
02:08:31,420 --> 02:08:33,090
but I just didn't think
to do that at the moment.

4916
02:08:33,091 --> 02:08:33,311
They're like,

4917
02:08:33,311 --> 02:08:34,510
we just got to get a couple of pickups.

4918
02:08:34,511 --> 02:08:35,610
That was the stage manager.

4919
02:08:35,660 --> 02:08:35,861
I'm like,

4920
02:08:35,861 --> 02:08:36,190
okay,

4921
02:08:36,190 --> 02:08:39,580
like maybe I could have said
to him now do it in post.

4922
02:08:39,581 --> 02:08:40,690
And he might've been fine with it,

4923
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:41,531
but again,

4924
02:08:41,531 --> 02:08:42,580
it was such a learning,

4925
02:08:42,610 --> 02:08:44,290
and I hate to 60 sound like such a Douche,

4926
02:08:44,950 --> 02:08:45,460
but it was,

4927
02:08:45,460 --> 02:08:50,200
they gave me so much ability to do
what I want without fucking with me.

4928
02:08:50,530 --> 02:08:52,690
That I might've made a couple of like,

4929
02:08:52,691 --> 02:08:52,961
oh yeah,

4930
02:08:52,961 --> 02:08:54,280
I should've done this instead of that.

4931
02:08:54,430 --> 02:08:54,761
Right.

4932
02:08:54,761 --> 02:08:57,180
Well it seems like you could probably
figure that out as you go along.

4933
02:08:57,230 --> 02:08:58,570
Whenever you start something out.

4934
02:08:58,571 --> 02:08:59,141
It always has.

4935
02:08:59,141 --> 02:08:59,380
Like,

4936
02:08:59,380 --> 02:08:59,651
you know,

4937
02:08:59,651 --> 02:09:00,730
there's always this bumps.

4938
02:09:00,731 --> 02:09:01,031
I mean,

4939
02:09:01,031 --> 02:09:02,320
and they gave me an extra episode.

4940
02:09:02,530 --> 02:09:04,690
We were supposed to do three
and then they were like,

4941
02:09:04,691 --> 02:09:06,400
we might do two because of scheduling.

4942
02:09:06,401 --> 02:09:07,390
And then I sat down with editing.

4943
02:09:07,391 --> 02:09:07,571
He goes,

4944
02:09:07,571 --> 02:09:07,661
well,

4945
02:09:07,661 --> 02:09:07,881
fuck,

4946
02:09:07,881 --> 02:09:08,790
why don't we just try for,

4947
02:09:09,350 --> 02:09:10,051
and they just threw it up.

4948
02:09:10,051 --> 02:09:11,170
But like that's how they do things.

4949
02:09:11,171 --> 02:09:12,400
They throw an extra episode.

4950
02:09:12,700 --> 02:09:16,600
So I had David tells the guest and I had
does Shirad small in Boston a pace for

4951
02:09:16,601 --> 02:09:20,230
me and it was just fucking funny
hanging with three other Comedians,

4952
02:09:20,620 --> 02:09:20,921
you know?

4953
02:09:20,921 --> 02:09:23,890
And that kind of felt like a much
different one than Tyson and data.

4954
02:09:23,950 --> 02:09:24,783
Do you think,

4955
02:09:24,790 --> 02:09:28,790
what do you think is going to go down
with September when your contract is up?

4956
02:09:28,840 --> 02:09:30,190
October 4th I don't know.

4957
02:09:30,460 --> 02:09:34,030
I mean like I love the Gig,

4958
02:09:34,090 --> 02:09:35,410
I love performing.

4959
02:09:35,470 --> 02:09:36,251
But you love the Gig.

4960
02:09:36,251 --> 02:09:37,061
The same with Anthony.

4961
02:09:37,061 --> 02:09:38,260
Not of course not.

4962
02:09:38,380 --> 02:09:38,501
No,

4963
02:09:38,501 --> 02:09:38,591
no.

4964
02:09:38,591 --> 02:09:38,861
I mean,

4965
02:09:38,861 --> 02:09:41,680
I mean the idea of performing
either alone or with other people.

4966
02:09:41,750 --> 02:09:42,460
Right.

4967
02:09:42,460 --> 02:09:45,190
I want this thing to work
because I want my own thing.

4968
02:09:45,191 --> 02:09:46,370
Like I've done so many things.

4969
02:09:46,720 --> 02:09:47,350
The vice thing.

4970
02:09:47,350 --> 02:09:47,580
Yeah,

4971
02:09:47,580 --> 02:09:48,550
Jim Norton show.

4972
02:09:48,551 --> 02:09:50,350
I want to have my own thing too,

4973
02:09:50,351 --> 02:09:53,380
because you feel like a more complete
performer when you're not always with Opie

4974
02:09:53,381 --> 02:09:57,070
and Anthony Are Collin Quinn or Louis C
K or Amy Schumer's put me on her show.

4975
02:09:57,390 --> 02:10:00,340
Like I don't always want to
be on somebody else's thing.

4976
02:10:01,070 --> 02:10:01,870
Um,

4977
02:10:01,870 --> 02:10:04,960
so I love the idea of
performing on the radio.

4978
02:10:05,380 --> 02:10:06,250
I love doing it with,

4979
02:10:06,251 --> 02:10:06,790
Oop,

4980
02:10:06,790 --> 02:10:09,190
I love doing it with opie
and Anthony Moore because,

4981
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:10,660
and I like to say the
same thing of Opie left.

4982
02:10:10,661 --> 02:10:14,830
Like I honestly do love being
a part of that radio show.

4983
02:10:15,750 --> 02:10:18,880
Being without Anthony is difficult
and it would say the same thing.

4984
02:10:18,881 --> 02:10:20,910
It's just like,

4985
02:10:20,920 --> 02:10:21,090
it's,

4986
02:10:21,090 --> 02:10:26,090
it's hard to realize how much space a
person fills in your life until they're

4987
02:10:26,321 --> 02:10:27,154
not there.

4988
02:10:27,280 --> 02:10:27,521
Like,

4989
02:10:27,521 --> 02:10:27,821
I mean,

4990
02:10:27,821 --> 02:10:29,410
we all know Anthony's a comic gene,

4991
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:30,520
that's easy to say,

4992
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:32,020
but it's like the little moments,

4993
02:10:32,021 --> 02:10:33,340
like when there's that chair,

4994
02:10:33,470 --> 02:10:33,711
I mean,

4995
02:10:33,711 --> 02:10:33,980
I'm

4996
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:34,280
close.

4997
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:35,720
I said closer to,

4998
02:10:35,721 --> 02:10:36,110
um,

4999
02:10:36,110 --> 02:10:38,660
to Anthony that I do to you every day,

5000
02:10:38,661 --> 02:10:39,920
five days a week for 10 years.

5001
02:10:40,190 --> 02:10:41,120
And now he's just gone.

5002
02:10:41,480 --> 02:10:44,390
And it's really hard to get
used to that empty seat.

5003
02:10:44,750 --> 02:10:48,410
Whether he's saying something funny or
whether he's just doing a stupid Iraq

5004
02:10:48,411 --> 02:10:50,900
joke or a little aside or just pie.

5005
02:10:50,930 --> 02:10:53,150
It's like this whole
fucking vacuum of this,

5006
02:10:53,540 --> 02:10:55,850
this great powerful brain that used to be,

5007
02:10:55,851 --> 02:10:56,181
you know,

5008
02:10:56,181 --> 02:10:58,670
a foot away from it or
just talking about things.

5009
02:10:58,671 --> 02:10:59,870
He's a fascinating guy.

5010
02:10:59,871 --> 02:11:01,640
He's got a lot of information in his head.

5011
02:11:01,730 --> 02:11:04,610
He can talk about anything
for any length of time,

5012
02:11:05,010 --> 02:11:06,050
anything he could be.

5013
02:11:06,051 --> 02:11:07,610
And we've said that like he porter,

5014
02:11:07,690 --> 02:11:08,750
and I've said this before,

5015
02:11:08,780 --> 02:11:12,920
but Patrice said that Anthony can access
funny faster than anybody he'd ever

5016
02:11:12,921 --> 02:11:13,580
known.

5017
02:11:13,580 --> 02:11:18,580
Like he just had the ability to access
being funny immediately on any subject.

5018
02:11:20,240 --> 02:11:21,260
Like if you're talking like you know,

5019
02:11:21,261 --> 02:11:22,400
he was a tin knocker,

5020
02:11:22,401 --> 02:11:26,780
he would put in air conditioning vents
and he can walk you through that in a

5021
02:11:26,781 --> 02:11:31,400
fascinating way and be funny about
it and be captivating with it.

5022
02:11:31,940 --> 02:11:32,331
Me,

5023
02:11:32,331 --> 02:11:32,871
I and I,

5024
02:11:32,871 --> 02:11:35,210
I just die telling a story.

5025
02:11:35,480 --> 02:11:37,520
I lose people in me.

5026
02:11:38,060 --> 02:11:39,140
It's a joke I've done,

5027
02:11:39,320 --> 02:11:43,130
but I meant this sincerity of it
that if I was on nine 11 on the,

5028
02:11:43,131 --> 02:11:45,050
if I made it out of the first tower,

5029
02:11:45,051 --> 02:11:46,940
I would lose people
halfway through the story.

5030
02:11:47,120 --> 02:11:51,320
Like I just have no ability to go from
the beginning to the middle to the end

5031
02:11:51,410 --> 02:11:52,970
and keep people locked in.

5032
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:56,060
Did you guys have a meeting
with serious after this is over?

5033
02:11:56,061 --> 02:11:57,740
I know we talked to Scott,

5034
02:11:57,980 --> 02:12:00,050
I talked to Scott on
the phone and he goes,

5035
02:12:00,051 --> 02:12:00,171
look,

5036
02:12:00,171 --> 02:12:02,870
we're going to try to move forward with
you and opie and see how it happens.

5037
02:12:03,380 --> 02:12:03,831
He goes,

5038
02:12:03,831 --> 02:12:05,600
work through it organically on the air.

5039
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:07,550
They didn't tell us how to do it.

5040
02:12:07,551 --> 02:12:09,320
They didn't say don't bad
mouth the company don't.

5041
02:12:09,680 --> 02:12:11,840
He said worked through it organically
on the air and what we'll see what

5042
02:12:11,841 --> 02:12:12,674
happens.

5043
02:12:12,770 --> 02:12:13,221
So I mean,

5044
02:12:13,221 --> 02:12:14,054
see what happens.

5045
02:12:14,180 --> 02:12:16,850
They completely closed the idea
of Anthony ever coming back.

5046
02:12:16,910 --> 02:12:17,691
I don't think so.

5047
02:12:17,691 --> 02:12:18,280
Um,

5048
02:12:18,280 --> 02:12:18,460
and,

5049
02:12:18,460 --> 02:12:20,030
and they've given me no indication.

5050
02:12:20,031 --> 02:12:23,120
So I'm careful how I say that because
I don't want the fans getting like I'm

5051
02:12:23,121 --> 02:12:24,590
putting false hope out there,

5052
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:25,061
but I'm,

5053
02:12:25,061 --> 02:12:27,260
I'm just being truthful is they,

5054
02:12:27,261 --> 02:12:32,261
it doesn't feel final to me and maybe
that's my own denial or my own lack of

5055
02:12:32,841 --> 02:12:35,210
willingness to admit that
this thing could be over.

5056
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:36,760
Like it was really sad man.

5057
02:12:36,770 --> 02:12:37,230
Last time I saw,

5058
02:12:37,230 --> 02:12:39,980
I don't think I went to his fucking 4th
of July party and I was very depressed

5059
02:12:39,981 --> 02:12:40,814
driving home.

5060
02:12:41,030 --> 02:12:43,610
Like I know I'm going to be okay
financially and I know like,

5061
02:12:43,611 --> 02:12:44,840
hey there's other show could take off.

5062
02:12:44,841 --> 02:12:45,830
Hey you got stand up.

5063
02:12:45,831 --> 02:12:46,664
Hey you got,

5064
02:12:46,820 --> 02:12:50,470
but just the idea that this
thing you love to do like art,

5065
02:12:50,540 --> 02:12:52,340
this chapter is closed.

5066
02:12:52,400 --> 02:12:54,830
Like just fucking depresses me,

5067
02:12:55,090 --> 02:12:56,870
depresses me to listen to it.

5068
02:12:56,871 --> 02:12:59,120
I can imagine if it was me every day,

5069
02:12:59,270 --> 02:13:02,090
day in day out being a part of it,

5070
02:13:02,360 --> 02:13:02,730
you know,

5071
02:13:02,730 --> 02:13:04,490
every time I did it I loved it.

5072
02:13:04,850 --> 02:13:06,530
I mean I had a great time doing your show.

5073
02:13:06,531 --> 02:13:08,990
So my favorite radio show
of all time without a doubt,

5074
02:13:09,020 --> 02:13:10,280
it's a real conversation.

5075
02:13:10,281 --> 02:13:13,460
You have real moments and the laughs
somebody played for me recently are,

5076
02:13:13,510 --> 02:13:16,730
they sent me a link to Jim
Norton's laugh compilation.

5077
02:13:16,731 --> 02:13:19,850
There's just times where people have
made me laugh on the shell and I listened

5078
02:13:19,851 --> 02:13:22,850
to part one and two because
a point is not me laughing.

5079
02:13:22,851 --> 02:13:23,690
It's the things,

5080
02:13:24,440 --> 02:13:25,001
and you know,

5081
02:13:25,001 --> 02:13:28,550
most of those labs have come from
Anthony more than any gas or anybody.

5082
02:13:28,970 --> 02:13:29,880
And some of the things that,

5083
02:13:29,881 --> 02:13:31,980
if he did a thing recently or years ago

5084
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:35,580
that I heard two days ago when we were
talking about people who have shot

5085
02:13:35,581 --> 02:13:40,581
themselves in the head and survived and
Anthony did the voice of the guy who

5086
02:13:41,341 --> 02:13:42,780
survived and he just wanted to,

5087
02:13:42,781 --> 02:13:44,520
it was an immediate,

5088
02:13:44,970 --> 02:13:49,290
he became the guy who had shot himself
in the fucking head and survived there.

5089
02:13:49,291 --> 02:13:53,160
He's talking about how he just has a
more positive outlook and I'm howling

5090
02:13:53,161 --> 02:13:54,050
listening to it in,

5091
02:13:54,070 --> 02:13:56,970
in the clip and I'm listening to it like,

5092
02:13:57,680 --> 02:13:57,930
yeah,

5093
02:13:57,930 --> 02:14:00,090
two days ago and I'm
laughing all over again.

5094
02:14:00,120 --> 02:14:01,800
Like I forgot that bit ever existed,

5095
02:14:01,801 --> 02:14:02,161
but God,

5096
02:14:02,161 --> 02:14:04,590
this cocksucker made me fucking laugh.

5097
02:14:04,740 --> 02:14:06,450
And I'm not talking
about him like he's dead,

5098
02:14:06,750 --> 02:14:09,720
but I mean that's how
valuable a thing he is.

5099
02:14:09,721 --> 02:14:10,311
Like I can,

5100
02:14:10,311 --> 02:14:12,120
I can't listen to two radio bits.

5101
02:14:12,510 --> 02:14:13,740
They made a big mistake.

5102
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:16,020
I think they made a big
steak for a couple reasons.

5103
02:14:16,020 --> 02:14:16,291
One,

5104
02:14:16,291 --> 02:14:18,380
I think that they made a big
mistake because I think it's,

5105
02:14:18,430 --> 02:14:21,210
it's going to open the door more to the
Internet because people are going to

5106
02:14:21,211 --> 02:14:26,211
look at that as the only last
remaining true free speech option.

5107
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:27,100
Yep.

5108
02:14:27,100 --> 02:14:28,230
Because that's what it is.

5109
02:14:28,320 --> 02:14:28,561
Look,

5110
02:14:28,561 --> 02:14:29,394
you can,

5111
02:14:29,670 --> 02:14:32,280
you could say you don't like this podcast.

5112
02:14:32,281 --> 02:14:34,020
You can decide that I'm offensive.

5113
02:14:34,021 --> 02:14:34,770
You can do it,

5114
02:14:34,770 --> 02:14:36,330
but you can't stop it.

5115
02:14:36,660 --> 02:14:37,493
I mean you might,

5116
02:14:37,500 --> 02:14:39,000
even though the host might say,

5117
02:14:39,001 --> 02:14:39,960
we don't want to host you anymore,

5118
02:14:40,020 --> 02:14:40,853
I'll find another host.

5119
02:14:41,170 --> 02:14:42,360
You know those sponsors might say,

5120
02:14:42,361 --> 02:14:43,650
we don't want to be your sponsor anymore.

5121
02:14:43,710 --> 02:14:44,311
Well guess what?

5122
02:14:44,311 --> 02:14:45,540
I'll do it with no sponsor.

5123
02:14:45,660 --> 02:14:47,460
We did it with no sponsors for years.

5124
02:14:48,750 --> 02:14:52,710
This is the only real option
where you're your own producer,

5125
02:14:52,711 --> 02:14:53,790
your own director,

5126
02:14:53,791 --> 02:14:54,624
your own,

5127
02:14:54,810 --> 02:14:55,890
you're the whole thing.

5128
02:14:55,920 --> 02:14:57,030
You're the performer.

5129
02:14:57,031 --> 02:14:57,900
You're the whole thing.

5130
02:14:58,290 --> 02:15:03,290
That's where it's sad because just like
a standup is entirely responsible for

5131
02:15:03,481 --> 02:15:04,860
your act that you put on stage.

5132
02:15:05,040 --> 02:15:08,310
If you had some producer hovering over
your fucking shoulder every time you

5133
02:15:08,311 --> 02:15:09,144
wrote a bit,

5134
02:15:09,180 --> 02:15:11,490
every time you were thinking
about putting together a set list,

5135
02:15:11,670 --> 02:15:13,740
every time you are going
up and doing a show,

5136
02:15:13,760 --> 02:15:13,950
right,

5137
02:15:13,950 --> 02:15:15,450
they would review it afterwards.

5138
02:15:15,600 --> 02:15:16,860
That would be gross.

5139
02:15:16,980 --> 02:15:19,050
That would take all the
fun out of being a comic.

5140
02:15:19,410 --> 02:15:19,681
Yeah,

5141
02:15:19,681 --> 02:15:20,491
it would be awful.

5142
02:15:20,491 --> 02:15:20,701
I mean,

5143
02:15:20,701 --> 02:15:24,090
that's why I'm a bad collaborator because
you're so used to having absolute and

5144
02:15:24,150 --> 02:15:26,670
ultimate control of things.

5145
02:15:26,671 --> 02:15:28,050
So you're a perfect example.

5146
02:15:28,140 --> 02:15:32,250
Think about you and you as a
successful performer and personality.

5147
02:15:32,640 --> 02:15:37,500
Who the fuck would have ever thought you
could have made a mainstream career out

5148
02:15:37,501 --> 02:15:39,270
of talking about your love of trannies,

5149
02:15:39,450 --> 02:15:44,450
talking about shit and Piss and shit
in in each other's mouths and p and on

5150
02:15:44,581 --> 02:15:45,031
people,

5151
02:15:45,031 --> 02:15:45,990
Monster Rain.

5152
02:15:46,140 --> 02:15:50,250
Just look at the honest things that
you've tackled and because you're honest,

5153
02:15:50,251 --> 02:15:51,150
because you're funny.

5154
02:15:51,450 --> 02:15:53,940
If you had to vet that
through somebody else,

5155
02:15:53,941 --> 02:15:58,500
if you had to have that filter through
some sort of a mainstream producer,

5156
02:15:58,770 --> 02:16:00,330
it would've never happened.

5157
02:16:01,080 --> 02:16:02,000
Never work.

5158
02:16:02,010 --> 02:16:03,330
You're absolutely right.

5159
02:16:03,420 --> 02:16:04,420
I mean that's why you're right.

5160
02:16:04,570 --> 02:16:07,410
The Internet is the last
place where at least,

5161
02:16:07,411 --> 02:16:08,550
I mean for now,

5162
02:16:08,580 --> 02:16:10,140
who the fuck knows what happens with that?

5163
02:16:10,170 --> 02:16:11,340
But all that stuff you did,

5164
02:16:11,341 --> 02:16:12,300
you did on serious,

5165
02:16:12,301 --> 02:16:14,580
serious had a different approach
when they first came out.

5166
02:16:14,700 --> 02:16:19,140
They've slowly but surely clamped down
from that Condoleezza Rice incident.

5167
02:16:19,290 --> 02:16:20,123
That's where it was like,

5168
02:16:20,130 --> 02:16:20,610
Ooh,

5169
02:16:20,610 --> 02:16:24,420
you could get in trouble for something
that someone says on a radio show that

5170
02:16:24,421 --> 02:16:27,420
isn't even like a guest.

5171
02:16:27,570 --> 02:16:28,111
Like I mean,

5172
02:16:28,111 --> 02:16:28,820
isn't even one,

5173
02:16:28,820 --> 02:16:29,740
one of the hosts,

5174
02:16:29,770 --> 02:16:30,010
right?

5175
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:31,420
He was at your show could get canceled.

5176
02:16:31,430 --> 02:16:32,290
The homeless guy.

5177
02:16:32,360 --> 02:16:33,070
Yeah,

5178
02:16:33,070 --> 02:16:36,030
and they were going to fire us that Eric
Logan say that was XM wasn't this year.

5179
02:16:36,280 --> 02:16:36,730
It was,

5180
02:16:36,730 --> 02:16:37,340
and this is how,

5181
02:16:37,340 --> 02:16:37,960
what happened?

5182
02:16:37,960 --> 02:16:39,430
The fucking the NAB,

5183
02:16:39,940 --> 02:16:41,410
the National Association of broadcasters.

5184
02:16:41,430 --> 02:16:42,730
Somebody on that side,

5185
02:16:42,731 --> 02:16:43,780
I think was what was pushing it.

5186
02:16:44,050 --> 02:16:47,530
Could the story went on drudge and
Brietbart will this hurt the merger?

5187
02:16:47,860 --> 02:16:48,550
And again,

5188
02:16:48,550 --> 02:16:50,920
the guys who ran the this
when they're about to merge,

5189
02:16:51,250 --> 02:16:53,050
will this injure the merger?

5190
02:16:53,260 --> 02:16:56,860
And man it was $1 billion at stake and
it wasn't going to hurt the merger,

5191
02:16:57,130 --> 02:16:58,570
but they fucking panicked.

5192
02:16:58,840 --> 02:17:00,880
And these are all different
people that are in charge now.

5193
02:17:01,020 --> 02:17:01,360
Uh,

5194
02:17:01,360 --> 02:17:04,870
but they're like well all and they
don't know how to deal with stuff.

5195
02:17:04,871 --> 02:17:05,980
So they get the phone call.

5196
02:17:05,981 --> 02:17:08,710
The Guy Nate I think was running
XM at the time or coupon narrow.

5197
02:17:09,550 --> 02:17:10,600
What do you think of this thing?

5198
02:17:10,600 --> 02:17:14,460
They said a homeless guy said he wants
to rape Condoleezza Rice and felt why?

5199
02:17:14,510 --> 02:17:15,640
Like he,

5200
02:17:16,150 --> 02:17:17,850
he's worried about a billion
dollar merger and he,

5201
02:17:17,851 --> 02:17:18,191
and he,

5202
02:17:18,191 --> 02:17:18,610
and I'm not,

5203
02:17:18,610 --> 02:17:20,620
I'm not defending them suspending us,

5204
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:25,480
but I try to put myself in there like the,

5205
02:17:25,520 --> 02:17:26,840
and this is a guy I mentioned Louis,

5206
02:17:26,860 --> 02:17:27,521
cause he's a good,

5207
02:17:27,521 --> 02:17:32,521
he's a good nonemotional reactor to
things and he'll look at things and go,

5208
02:17:32,981 --> 02:17:34,750
well they're just trying to do this.

5209
02:17:34,751 --> 02:17:38,380
And like Louie will give you a very
logical reason as to why something's

5210
02:17:38,381 --> 02:17:39,214
happening.

5211
02:17:39,490 --> 02:17:39,851
And it's like,

5212
02:17:39,851 --> 02:17:40,061
yeah,

5213
02:17:40,061 --> 02:17:41,050
I wish I would've seen that.

5214
02:17:41,080 --> 02:17:43,130
I get too angry and
emotional and you're like,

5215
02:17:43,230 --> 02:17:43,661
fuck that.

5216
02:17:43,661 --> 02:17:44,410
And they're saying,

5217
02:17:44,410 --> 02:17:45,041
and then I'll go like,

5218
02:17:45,041 --> 02:17:45,311
okay,

5219
02:17:45,311 --> 02:17:46,720
that's $1 billion company.

5220
02:17:46,900 --> 02:17:47,770
They're not used to this.

5221
02:17:47,771 --> 02:17:52,771
And they hear this guy wants to fucking
first lady raped Bush or George Bush and

5222
02:17:52,811 --> 02:17:53,690
they're laughing about it.

5223
02:17:54,130 --> 02:17:56,320
Merger might be threatened to
pipe the fuck 'em get rid of him.

5224
02:17:56,320 --> 02:17:57,160
And He'd just panics.

5225
02:17:57,460 --> 02:18:01,030
Isn't it fascinating though that you're
talking about a billion dollar company?

5226
02:18:01,150 --> 02:18:01,660
Okay.

5227
02:18:01,660 --> 02:18:04,660
Sirius XM billion dollar company.

5228
02:18:04,690 --> 02:18:05,523
Okay.

5229
02:18:05,590 --> 02:18:07,300
What exactly are they selling?

5230
02:18:08,110 --> 02:18:09,820
What they're selling is content.

5231
02:18:09,850 --> 02:18:11,050
Who delivers that content?

5232
02:18:11,500 --> 02:18:12,610
Guys like opie and Anthony,

5233
02:18:12,700 --> 02:18:13,600
guys like Jim Norton.

5234
02:18:13,810 --> 02:18:16,900
There's selling your
ability to be entertaining.

5235
02:18:17,230 --> 02:18:18,160
Other than that,

5236
02:18:18,730 --> 02:18:19,810
it's just music.

5237
02:18:20,230 --> 02:18:23,440
How do you have $1 billion
company that's just selling music?

5238
02:18:23,640 --> 02:18:23,930
Well,

5239
02:18:23,930 --> 02:18:24,490
I don't,

5240
02:18:24,490 --> 02:18:27,460
that's where my argument would be to
it looked the talk thing is the last,

5241
02:18:28,770 --> 02:18:31,180
like the last thing you guys have,

5242
02:18:31,181 --> 02:18:32,014
and this is for any,

5243
02:18:32,260 --> 02:18:33,850
a terrestrial radio to the last thing.

5244
02:18:33,851 --> 02:18:37,330
You have his original talk content
and their point back would be,

5245
02:18:37,570 --> 02:18:39,040
well that's a great thing that we have,

5246
02:18:39,220 --> 02:18:40,570
but we also have,

5247
02:18:40,930 --> 02:18:41,620
um,

5248
02:18:41,620 --> 02:18:43,060
whether it's a celebrity,

5249
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:47,140
people doing shit or we have
sports that you can't get across.

5250
02:18:47,141 --> 02:18:48,040
Let's say we have the MBA,

5251
02:18:48,041 --> 02:18:48,970
we have a major league baseball,

5252
02:18:49,140 --> 02:18:50,320
but I'm just saying that's
what they would say.

5253
02:18:50,340 --> 02:18:50,540
Yeah.

5254
02:18:50,540 --> 02:18:51,480
But nobody's paying for that.

5255
02:18:51,490 --> 02:18:52,061
Let's be honest.

5256
02:18:52,061 --> 02:18:54,040
They're paying for stern and
they're paying for opiate.

5257
02:18:54,041 --> 02:18:54,760
Anthony.

5258
02:18:54,760 --> 02:18:55,600
I hope so man.

5259
02:18:55,690 --> 02:18:58,540
It's cause you said Spotify
and like those like Pandora,

5260
02:18:58,690 --> 02:18:59,141
they used to be,

5261
02:18:59,141 --> 02:19:02,350
I like Sirius radio cause they had
like the 30s to forties to 50s,

5262
02:19:02,351 --> 02:19:03,700
whatever and all the
different radio stations.

5263
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:06,550
Now did you just put Spotify
put anything you wanted as the,

5264
02:19:06,640 --> 02:19:07,030
you know,

5265
02:19:07,030 --> 02:19:07,391
yeah,

5266
02:19:07,391 --> 02:19:07,990
I mean I,

5267
02:19:07,990 --> 02:19:10,120
I get almost all my shit from iTunes.

5268
02:19:10,150 --> 02:19:13,540
I don't ever listen to music in my car
anymore unless it's coming off of my

5269
02:19:13,541 --> 02:19:14,260
phone.

5270
02:19:14,260 --> 02:19:15,093
I just,

5271
02:19:15,640 --> 02:19:16,390
it's just,

5272
02:19:16,390 --> 02:19:17,223
I don't need to,

5273
02:19:17,380 --> 02:19:18,191
you don't need to anymore.

5274
02:19:18,191 --> 02:19:19,210
You don't need them anymore.

5275
02:19:19,470 --> 02:19:24,470
And what the last thing that the exciting
is things like stern and things like

5276
02:19:24,611 --> 02:19:27,980
opion Anthony where you
can have a guy who is

5277
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:29,330
just freewheeling,

5278
02:19:29,360 --> 02:19:30,380
same whatever he wants,

5279
02:19:30,381 --> 02:19:32,000
doesn't have to worry about
language restrictions,

5280
02:19:32,001 --> 02:19:35,600
does it have to worry about anything
and the fact that he can get fired for

5281
02:19:35,601 --> 02:19:39,020
saying the same things that
he's always said on his show,

5282
02:19:39,470 --> 02:19:42,710
the sang them in a text message that
they're so ignorant that they can't

5283
02:19:42,711 --> 02:19:43,970
recognize that this is,

5284
02:19:44,270 --> 02:19:45,680
you're taking it out of context.

5285
02:19:45,681 --> 02:19:48,200
You're taking it from a guy who
has just recently been assaulted.

5286
02:19:48,410 --> 02:19:49,550
You're taking it from a guy,

5287
02:19:49,551 --> 02:19:53,150
probably had a couple of drinks and then
when he said it and he shouldn't have

5288
02:19:53,151 --> 02:19:53,630
done it,

5289
02:19:53,630 --> 02:19:54,463
he fucked up.

5290
02:19:54,500 --> 02:19:56,390
He definitely shouldn't have
gone on that Twitter rampage.

5291
02:19:56,580 --> 02:19:57,620
He should have said it on a video

5292
02:19:57,990 --> 02:19:59,830
and you know what podcast or I'm the show,

5293
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:02,080
the show on the show.

5294
02:20:02,081 --> 02:20:03,000
It would have been perfect,

5295
02:20:03,130 --> 02:20:04,620
but have been a great episode.

5296
02:20:04,621 --> 02:20:05,640
All of that would have been fun.

5297
02:20:05,660 --> 02:20:05,771
And,

5298
02:20:05,771 --> 02:20:07,140
and Keith Robinson pointed out,

5299
02:20:07,141 --> 02:20:08,250
he's like the teasing.

5300
02:20:08,251 --> 02:20:09,800
We could've given him a,

5301
02:20:09,850 --> 02:20:11,350
the teasing.

5302
02:20:11,370 --> 02:20:12,180
Beautiful.

5303
02:20:12,180 --> 02:20:12,470
But,

5304
02:20:12,470 --> 02:20:14,880
but I don't know if that's
something that will ever change.

5305
02:20:14,881 --> 02:20:16,710
Like they may at one point,

5306
02:20:17,080 --> 02:20:19,500
we do kind of understand that maybe he's,

5307
02:20:19,560 --> 02:20:19,801
you know,

5308
02:20:19,801 --> 02:20:21,450
he's a valuable asset to the like,

5309
02:20:21,451 --> 02:20:21,661
you know,

5310
02:20:21,661 --> 02:20:21,990
again,

5311
02:20:21,990 --> 02:20:22,320
I don't,

5312
02:20:22,320 --> 02:20:25,530
I don't know why I don't get that feeling
cause they haven't said to me we'll

5313
02:20:25,531 --> 02:20:26,290
bring him back.

5314
02:20:26,290 --> 02:20:27,123
They really haven't.

5315
02:20:27,390 --> 02:20:28,530
And I never want to give fans,

5316
02:20:28,531 --> 02:20:30,390
I'm not trying to keep fans from Caribou.

5317
02:20:30,780 --> 02:20:32,130
It literally is just a feeling,

5318
02:20:32,131 --> 02:20:33,150
a gut feeling.

5319
02:20:33,510 --> 02:20:34,860
He didn't drop any bombs.

5320
02:20:34,861 --> 02:20:35,760
He didn't go on this.

5321
02:20:36,180 --> 02:20:39,880
And I've talked to him enough to know
what his intent was and maybe I'm just

5322
02:20:39,960 --> 02:20:40,980
naive dummy in me,

5323
02:20:40,981 --> 02:20:41,701
but I keep thinking,

5324
02:20:41,701 --> 02:20:41,881
man,

5325
02:20:41,881 --> 02:20:42,870
he should come back.

5326
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:44,280
He can come back.

5327
02:20:44,281 --> 02:20:45,300
Just give it some time.

5328
02:20:45,590 --> 02:20:46,650
I just keep hoping for that.

5329
02:20:47,170 --> 02:20:47,801
You can come back.

5330
02:20:47,801 --> 02:20:48,940
I think if they gave it some time,

5331
02:20:48,941 --> 02:20:51,280
he definitely can come back in
the context of what he said.

5332
02:20:51,310 --> 02:20:51,450
Well,

5333
02:20:51,450 --> 02:20:52,330
it wasn't that bad.

5334
02:20:53,350 --> 02:20:53,800
You know,

5335
02:20:53,800 --> 02:20:57,490
I wouldn't have been happy if it was my
company and I had shareholders and all

5336
02:20:57,491 --> 02:20:57,881
that jazz,

5337
02:20:57,881 --> 02:21:00,460
but I obviously I would
never be that guy anyway.

5338
02:21:00,461 --> 02:21:03,460
I would never be a fucking
head of a big company.

5339
02:21:03,461 --> 02:21:04,540
I'm just not built for it.

5340
02:21:04,541 --> 02:21:08,320
But you got to recognize
the entertainment quality,

5341
02:21:08,470 --> 02:21:10,720
you know the entertainment
aspect of that guy,

5342
02:21:10,721 --> 02:21:13,480
the head of the entertainment
possibilities of keeping
the show together.

5343
02:21:13,510 --> 02:21:14,500
It's because without that,

5344
02:21:14,530 --> 02:21:15,520
all you have is stern.

5345
02:21:15,880 --> 02:21:16,330
You know,

5346
02:21:16,330 --> 02:21:18,910
you mean obviously you guys are still
together and they'll still be a great

5347
02:21:18,911 --> 02:21:19,211
show,

5348
02:21:19,211 --> 02:21:20,800
but it's not the same show.

5349
02:21:20,880 --> 02:21:20,980
No,

5350
02:21:20,980 --> 02:21:21,813
it's not.

5351
02:21:22,060 --> 02:21:23,230
And you,

5352
02:21:23,231 --> 02:21:25,630
you leave open the door for
Anthony's starting his own thing,

5353
02:21:25,631 --> 02:21:27,010
some wildly successful thing.

5354
02:21:27,010 --> 02:21:27,843
And the Internet,

5355
02:21:27,850 --> 02:21:29,320
which also look,

5356
02:21:29,321 --> 02:21:32,620
if someone comes along and
they put together some sort
of an advertising budget

5357
02:21:32,740 --> 02:21:33,221
and they say,

5358
02:21:33,221 --> 02:21:34,000
hey listen,

5359
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:35,260
we would like to do the oop.

5360
02:21:35,261 --> 02:21:38,320
We'd like to host the opie and
Anthony podcasts on the Internet.

5361
02:21:38,321 --> 02:21:39,880
We'll take x percentage of the,

5362
02:21:39,881 --> 02:21:40,210
the,

5363
02:21:40,210 --> 02:21:41,230
the advertisers.

5364
02:21:41,350 --> 02:21:42,700
We've already got it lined up.

5365
02:21:42,790 --> 02:21:43,990
We have a big launch.

5366
02:21:43,991 --> 02:21:45,460
We're gonna do it around Thanksgiving.

5367
02:21:45,461 --> 02:21:47,980
Someone's going to fuck
a Turkey live on the air,

5368
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:48,341
you know,

5369
02:21:48,341 --> 02:21:48,731
whatever.

5370
02:21:48,731 --> 02:21:49,564
You know what I'm saying?

5371
02:21:49,600 --> 02:21:50,080
You start,

5372
02:21:50,080 --> 02:21:50,920
you start doing,

5373
02:21:50,950 --> 02:21:55,240
you come up with some idea to do
something completely free and wild on the

5374
02:21:55,241 --> 02:21:55,571
Internet.

5375
02:21:55,571 --> 02:21:57,250
A big advertising push,

5376
02:21:57,251 --> 02:21:59,200
buy Billboards Times Square,

5377
02:21:59,470 --> 02:21:59,741
you know,

5378
02:21:59,741 --> 02:22:00,610
fuck serious.

5379
02:22:00,611 --> 02:22:01,930
We're doing it on the Internet.

5380
02:22:02,110 --> 02:22:04,390
You know ONA is back and it's free.

5381
02:22:04,530 --> 02:22:05,800
Download it online.

5382
02:22:05,801 --> 02:22:07,690
You don't need to pay for
a subscription anymore.

5383
02:22:07,810 --> 02:22:09,100
Anybody can get it on your phone.

5384
02:22:09,101 --> 02:22:09,211
Do,

5385
02:22:09,211 --> 02:22:09,761
I mean you could do it.

5386
02:22:09,761 --> 02:22:10,451
The way we do it,

5387
02:22:10,451 --> 02:22:10,601
we're,

5388
02:22:10,601 --> 02:22:12,300
we're available on were,

5389
02:22:12,301 --> 02:22:15,760
were available online as an MP
three were available from iTunes.

5390
02:22:15,761 --> 02:22:16,960
We're available on Stitcher,

5391
02:22:17,110 --> 02:22:17,921
on Youtube,

5392
02:22:17,921 --> 02:22:18,760
on Ustream,

5393
02:22:18,761 --> 02:22:19,594
on Vimeo.

5394
02:22:19,630 --> 02:22:20,980
Have you just did something like that?

5395
02:22:20,981 --> 02:22:21,814
It would be [inaudible]

5396
02:22:21,920 --> 02:22:22,720
Yannick.

5397
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:22,931
Yeah,

5398
02:22:22,931 --> 02:22:23,231
maybe.

5399
02:22:23,231 --> 02:22:24,064
You're right man.

5400
02:22:24,070 --> 02:22:26,010
We have thought it and again,

5401
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:28,560
we're up in October 4th we don't know.

5402
02:22:28,620 --> 02:22:28,831
And I,

5403
02:22:28,831 --> 02:22:29,131
and I'm,

5404
02:22:29,131 --> 02:22:29,430
I'm,

5405
02:22:29,430 --> 02:22:32,880
we honestly don't know
what we do from here.

5406
02:22:32,881 --> 02:22:33,714
Like again,

5407
02:22:34,040 --> 02:22:35,250
[inaudible] and I are doing the show,

5408
02:22:35,251 --> 02:22:39,540
bringing guests in and just performing
and it's like we both feel the fucking

5409
02:22:39,570 --> 02:22:40,000
loss.

5410
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:41,100
Go through vice,

5411
02:22:41,160 --> 02:22:42,160
do it all through vice.

5412
02:22:42,180 --> 02:22:45,930
There'll be a wonderful promotion
vehicle to view you guys to do.

5413
02:22:45,931 --> 02:22:48,180
Opie and Anthony Live through vice.

5414
02:22:48,360 --> 02:22:49,980
They'll set you up with a studio,

5415
02:22:50,220 --> 02:22:53,430
do it all online through
this show as a video online,

5416
02:22:53,431 --> 02:22:54,240
and do this show,

5417
02:22:54,240 --> 02:22:55,860
have it available as a podcast.

5418
02:22:55,980 --> 02:22:58,980
Free downloads they provide
you with advertisers.

5419
02:22:59,220 --> 02:23:00,360
Wouldn't be hard to do.

5420
02:23:00,660 --> 02:23:02,700
Shane could hook that up in five seconds.

5421
02:23:02,850 --> 02:23:04,680
They can make one phone
call and it would be,

5422
02:23:04,681 --> 02:23:06,030
the wheels would be in motion.

5423
02:23:06,390 --> 02:23:07,080
I would,

5424
02:23:07,080 --> 02:23:07,500
uh,

5425
02:23:07,500 --> 02:23:08,460
I would love to do that.

5426
02:23:08,461 --> 02:23:09,570
And that's a guy that you,

5427
02:23:09,571 --> 02:23:10,051
you know,

5428
02:23:10,051 --> 02:23:13,380
like shit can get really crazy
and everyone's going to be fine.

5429
02:23:13,590 --> 02:23:13,921
Yeah.

5430
02:23:13,921 --> 02:23:14,461
Shane,

5431
02:23:14,461 --> 02:23:14,851
I mean,

5432
02:23:14,851 --> 02:23:17,110
looked at the fact the fact
that they didn't break my boy,

5433
02:23:17,111 --> 02:23:17,431
like I,

5434
02:23:17,431 --> 02:23:18,330
everyone says like,

5435
02:23:18,360 --> 02:23:18,541
oh,

5436
02:23:18,541 --> 02:23:19,091
we were allowed to do it.

5437
02:23:19,091 --> 02:23:19,924
We want guys,

5438
02:23:20,220 --> 02:23:20,791
but like they,

5439
02:23:20,791 --> 02:23:23,000
I can't believe the amount of like,

5440
02:23:23,180 --> 02:23:24,930
if this thing fails,

5441
02:23:25,260 --> 02:23:27,060
it is absolutely my fault.

5442
02:23:27,510 --> 02:23:29,760
It is 100% my fault.

5443
02:23:29,970 --> 02:23:31,980
I can't blame the company.

5444
02:23:32,010 --> 02:23:33,990
They fucking got gotten my ear and fuck.

5445
02:23:33,991 --> 02:23:35,370
They didn't give a fuck.

5446
02:23:35,700 --> 02:23:36,533
They really didn't.

5447
02:23:36,630 --> 02:23:37,830
It's this one is on me.

5448
02:23:37,831 --> 02:23:38,760
If it succeeds,

5449
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:39,960
I did a great job.

5450
02:23:39,961 --> 02:23:42,650
Kurt Metzger helped me and Jesse
Joyce contributed a little,

5451
02:23:42,680 --> 02:23:44,670
I tell contributed some brilliant stuff,

5452
02:23:45,210 --> 02:23:47,250
but vice allowed me freedom.

5453
02:23:47,310 --> 02:23:47,740
Totally.

5454
02:23:47,740 --> 02:23:51,870
The monologues are like are just
fucking are exactly what I wanted to do

5455
02:23:51,871 --> 02:23:52,920
monologue wise.

5456
02:23:53,370 --> 02:23:54,203
Um,

5457
02:23:54,420 --> 02:23:55,770
I have links that I,

5458
02:23:55,771 --> 02:23:56,140
which I,

5459
02:23:56,140 --> 02:23:57,840
they can't be posted but
I was going to send you,

5460
02:23:57,841 --> 02:23:58,110
but they,

5461
02:23:58,110 --> 02:23:59,520
they took so long to get them to me.

5462
02:23:59,910 --> 02:24:00,390
Um,

5463
02:24:00,390 --> 02:24:01,940
and I'm just so bad at this shifts,

5464
02:24:01,950 --> 02:24:02,671
get it to me later.

5465
02:24:02,671 --> 02:24:03,420
It doesn't matter.

5466
02:24:03,420 --> 02:24:03,781
Listen,

5467
02:24:03,781 --> 02:24:04,141
whatever,

5468
02:24:04,141 --> 02:24:05,070
whenever it comes out,

5469
02:24:05,071 --> 02:24:06,540
we'll promote the shit
out of me next Wednesday,

5470
02:24:06,541 --> 02:24:07,351
the 23rd,

5471
02:24:07,351 --> 02:24:08,011
next Wednesday,

5472
02:24:08,011 --> 02:24:08,671
the 23rd.

5473
02:24:08,671 --> 02:24:08,911
All right,

5474
02:24:08,911 --> 02:24:09,241
I'm going to,

5475
02:24:09,241 --> 02:24:09,990
I'll tweet it,

5476
02:24:09,990 --> 02:24:11,220
I'll tweet it when it's coming out.

5477
02:24:11,221 --> 02:24:13,320
I'll tweet it when it's on a tweet.

5478
02:24:13,321 --> 02:24:14,490
All four episodes.

5479
02:24:14,491 --> 02:24:15,990
I'll tweet links and websites.

5480
02:24:15,991 --> 02:24:16,711
Whatever you need to do,

5481
02:24:16,711 --> 02:24:16,950
man,

5482
02:24:16,950 --> 02:24:17,671
it's not going to fail.

5483
02:24:17,671 --> 02:24:19,320
It's going to be great
being a how it is man.

5484
02:24:19,350 --> 02:24:19,530
I,

5485
02:24:19,530 --> 02:24:21,100
I the fucking like,

5486
02:24:21,110 --> 02:24:22,290
I know intellectually,

5487
02:24:22,291 --> 02:24:22,411
yeah.

5488
02:24:22,411 --> 02:24:23,790
I'm a funny guy and I think it's,

5489
02:24:24,030 --> 02:24:25,560
there's things that will
be fixed in the show.

5490
02:24:25,561 --> 02:24:26,251
Like you know,

5491
02:24:26,251 --> 02:24:26,671
cause again,

5492
02:24:26,671 --> 02:24:28,140
it's a new thing.

5493
02:24:28,380 --> 02:24:30,030
But I also think like it came out funny,

5494
02:24:30,031 --> 02:24:31,290
like I'm happy with how it came out.

5495
02:24:31,291 --> 02:24:32,670
There was a lot of really funny lines.

5496
02:24:32,700 --> 02:24:35,700
Oh cow would fix this and fix
that and you live in your learn.

5497
02:24:35,730 --> 02:24:36,690
It's going to be great,

5498
02:24:36,930 --> 02:24:39,600
but I know that that part
of you that's never happy,

5499
02:24:39,601 --> 02:24:41,070
always going to have issues about things.

5500
02:24:41,071 --> 02:24:43,860
That's also what makes you
good because it keeps you,

5501
02:24:43,861 --> 02:24:48,240
keeps you like checking and
second guessing and working
on things and keeps you

5502
02:24:48,360 --> 02:24:49,860
striving for a high standard.

5503
02:24:50,220 --> 02:24:50,880
That's the,

5504
02:24:50,880 --> 02:24:51,491
it's the,

5505
02:24:51,491 --> 02:24:55,740
the dark inner secret of all comedians
that were never really happy with what we

5506
02:24:55,741 --> 02:24:56,070
do.

5507
02:24:56,070 --> 02:24:57,930
I obsess like that prom all,

5508
02:24:57,940 --> 02:24:58,430
I was like,

5509
02:24:58,430 --> 02:25:00,390
I was out in the parking
lot with my luggage,

5510
02:25:00,750 --> 02:25:02,400
talking to my fucking
manager on the phone.

5511
02:25:02,401 --> 02:25:02,611
I'm like,

5512
02:25:02,611 --> 02:25:03,800
I don't know why they're there.

5513
02:25:03,850 --> 02:25:05,010
The no one's gonna like that one.

5514
02:25:05,011 --> 02:25:05,281
I'm just,

5515
02:25:05,281 --> 02:25:05,611
I'm just,

5516
02:25:05,611 --> 02:25:07,200
I'm having a fucking panic attack.

5517
02:25:07,560 --> 02:25:09,270
And it's moments like that though,

5518
02:25:09,560 --> 02:25:12,690
if they'd say Tarantino would fight
all his editor who passed away,

5519
02:25:12,990 --> 02:25:16,830
but they said that she was such a big
piece of his great success because she was

5520
02:25:16,831 --> 02:25:21,150
so good at editing his stuff and I
heard they would have screaming matches

5521
02:25:21,151 --> 02:25:22,230
because you know,

5522
02:25:22,231 --> 02:25:23,950
or she didn't agree with her,

5523
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:29,160
but she in a detached way could see what
worked from the outside and I certainly

5524
02:25:29,291 --> 02:25:30,400
didn't have a yelling match with anyone,

5525
02:25:30,401 --> 02:25:34,900
but a lot of times I'm too close to it
to see what works and I would have been

5526
02:25:34,901 --> 02:25:39,100
totally wrong about this and I would have
thrown that promo out and not used it

5527
02:25:39,250 --> 02:25:40,630
because I am mostly in it.

5528
02:25:40,950 --> 02:25:41,371
Yeah,

5529
02:25:41,371 --> 02:25:42,660
you definitely would have been wrong.

5530
02:25:42,661 --> 02:25:42,871
Look,

5531
02:25:42,871 --> 02:25:43,740
I laughed hard.

5532
02:25:43,741 --> 02:25:44,700
I'd never seen it before.

5533
02:25:44,701 --> 02:25:45,760
Those are legit lab.

5534
02:25:46,410 --> 02:25:47,670
It's always going to be that way though,

5535
02:25:47,671 --> 02:25:48,440
Jim.

5536
02:25:48,440 --> 02:25:48,990
Yeah,

5537
02:25:48,990 --> 02:25:49,471
always going to,

5538
02:25:49,471 --> 02:25:49,891
yeah.

5539
02:25:49,891 --> 02:25:51,270
You're never going to be totally happy.

5540
02:25:51,271 --> 02:25:52,104
That's why you're good.

5541
02:25:52,370 --> 02:25:52,641
Yeah,

5542
02:25:52,641 --> 02:25:53,180
I guess.

5543
02:25:53,180 --> 02:25:54,500
But are you totally happy though?

5544
02:25:54,550 --> 02:25:56,420
You have to know what
a great I walk in here.

5545
02:25:56,421 --> 02:25:59,630
I see like all I think is
Rogan makes me feel lazy.

5546
02:25:59,860 --> 02:26:00,250
Like,

5547
02:26:00,250 --> 02:26:00,500
like,

5548
02:26:00,500 --> 02:26:02,030
because you have such a great setup yard,

5549
02:26:02,031 --> 02:26:03,400
UFC you,

5550
02:26:03,440 --> 02:26:04,970
I don't know how you
do this and smoke pot.

5551
02:26:05,150 --> 02:26:07,310
You're gonna fucking an
ice chamber this morning.

5552
02:26:07,610 --> 02:26:09,080
They're always doing this weird shit.

5553
02:26:09,081 --> 02:26:10,130
Reading articles.

5554
02:26:10,131 --> 02:26:11,810
You're the best follow on Twitter.

5555
02:26:12,080 --> 02:26:12,351
I'm like,

5556
02:26:12,351 --> 02:26:15,440
how does he fucking keep all
these plates spinning and,

5557
02:26:15,490 --> 02:26:17,060
but being really good at all of them.

5558
02:26:17,061 --> 02:26:18,650
I'm just a fucking lazy cunt.

5559
02:26:18,890 --> 02:26:20,420
I go in the morning and do radio.

5560
02:26:20,660 --> 02:26:23,690
I jerk off looking@eros.com
for nine hours.

5561
02:26:23,990 --> 02:26:26,180
I do a spot at the cellar
and I get a massage.

5562
02:26:26,210 --> 02:26:26,301
Well,

5563
02:26:26,301 --> 02:26:28,910
think about those nine hours
or you spent jerking off.

5564
02:26:29,030 --> 02:26:29,361
You know,

5565
02:26:29,361 --> 02:26:30,920
those are hours that you could have done.

5566
02:26:30,921 --> 02:26:31,850
All the things that I do.

5567
02:26:31,910 --> 02:26:32,743
Exactly.

5568
02:26:33,120 --> 02:26:33,521
Do you think?

5569
02:26:33,521 --> 02:26:33,700
I don't.

5570
02:26:33,700 --> 02:26:34,850
I think about while I'm doing it,

5571
02:26:35,300 --> 02:26:36,860
while I'm tugging my Prek,

5572
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:39,500
I'm thinking this could be
your green screen fixed,

5573
02:26:39,530 --> 02:26:39,861
you know?

5574
02:26:39,861 --> 02:26:40,101
Yeah.

5575
02:26:40,101 --> 02:26:40,760
I do.

5576
02:26:40,760 --> 02:26:41,960
Well with me,

5577
02:26:41,961 --> 02:26:42,171
it's,

5578
02:26:42,171 --> 02:26:43,770
I'm just real lucky that I found out a

5579
02:26:43,770 --> 02:26:45,270
bunch of things that I like doing.

5580
02:26:45,780 --> 02:26:46,290
You know,

5581
02:26:46,290 --> 02:26:47,820
all the things that I'm interested in,

5582
02:26:47,821 --> 02:26:49,440
whether it's the links
that I put up on Twitter,

5583
02:26:49,441 --> 02:26:50,221
whether it's the articles,

5584
02:26:50,221 --> 02:26:50,641
I read,

5585
02:26:50,641 --> 02:26:51,241
documentaries,

5586
02:26:51,241 --> 02:26:52,440
I watched martial arts,

5587
02:26:52,441 --> 02:26:54,000
I do whatever I'm doing,

5588
02:26:54,001 --> 02:26:54,960
bow hunting,

5589
02:26:55,770 --> 02:26:56,640
whatever I'm doing,

5590
02:26:56,880 --> 02:26:57,750
I'm interested in it.

5591
02:26:57,780 --> 02:26:58,201
So I'll just,

5592
02:26:58,201 --> 02:26:59,160
things I'm interested in.

5593
02:26:59,460 --> 02:27:02,100
I think that's like a big part of
what life would keeps life fun.

5594
02:27:02,370 --> 02:27:05,130
It just be interested in a bunch of
different things and pursue those things

5595
02:27:05,640 --> 02:27:06,780
with most people.

5596
02:27:06,900 --> 02:27:10,590
You can't pursue your real interest
because you have a job that's usually not

5597
02:27:10,591 --> 02:27:11,424
your real interest.

5598
02:27:11,700 --> 02:27:14,370
I've been there too when I was
doing fear factor and I'm no,

5599
02:27:14,371 --> 02:27:14,641
no,

5600
02:27:14,641 --> 02:27:15,271
woe is me.

5601
02:27:15,271 --> 02:27:16,140
It was a great gig.

5602
02:27:16,350 --> 02:27:18,960
Paid a lot of money's a lot of
exposure and all that good stuff,

5603
02:27:18,961 --> 02:27:19,980
but I didn't want to do it.

5604
02:27:20,340 --> 02:27:21,930
I only did it because
they wanted to pay me.

5605
02:27:22,080 --> 02:27:22,231
Right.

5606
02:27:22,231 --> 02:27:22,710
You know?

5607
02:27:22,710 --> 02:27:26,130
And there's a big difference between
living like that and living like I live

5608
02:27:26,131 --> 02:27:26,670
now.

5609
02:27:26,670 --> 02:27:27,840
Whereas everything I do,

5610
02:27:27,841 --> 02:27:28,591
I enjoy doing.

5611
02:27:28,591 --> 02:27:32,670
Whether I do the UFC or whether I do
a podcast or stand up or anything,

5612
02:27:32,840 --> 02:27:34,860
I enjoy all my things.

5613
02:27:35,100 --> 02:27:36,180
So in that way,

5614
02:27:36,181 --> 02:27:39,300
I figured out a way to
harmoniously manage my life.

5615
02:27:39,600 --> 02:27:40,680
It's nice to not hate it.

5616
02:27:40,681 --> 02:27:41,280
Right.

5617
02:27:41,280 --> 02:27:42,180
It's fantastic.

5618
02:27:42,181 --> 02:27:42,900
I love it.

5619
02:27:42,900 --> 02:27:43,081
I mean,

5620
02:27:43,081 --> 02:27:45,480
it's not that I love everything
I do and there's always,

5621
02:27:45,750 --> 02:27:45,991
you know,

5622
02:27:45,991 --> 02:27:50,190
even with podcasters podcast that don't
go well or I don't like moments in them

5623
02:27:50,191 --> 02:27:52,090
and those they will fuck with me and,

5624
02:27:52,200 --> 02:27:52,830
and I'll try to,

5625
02:27:52,830 --> 02:27:56,100
but they fuck with me because I care
because I'm trying to make it better.

5626
02:27:56,101 --> 02:27:56,461
And you know,

5627
02:27:56,461 --> 02:27:57,270
I'm trying,

5628
02:27:57,270 --> 02:27:58,800
when you're doing anything where it's,

5629
02:27:59,070 --> 02:28:01,680
it's a flowing sort of living thing,

5630
02:28:01,681 --> 02:28:05,280
you're ad libbing and maybe I added too
much or maybe I didn't add enough or

5631
02:28:05,281 --> 02:28:07,410
maybe I was too low energy
or maybe are too high energy.

5632
02:28:07,620 --> 02:28:08,270
This Matt,

5633
02:28:08,270 --> 02:28:08,491
it was,

5634
02:28:08,491 --> 02:28:08,911
you're just,

5635
02:28:08,911 --> 02:28:13,440
it's just because you care and if you
care and if you're constantly trying to

5636
02:28:13,441 --> 02:28:18,120
improve things and you're also taking
chances and you're also trying to innovate

5637
02:28:18,121 --> 02:28:18,954
and trying to,

5638
02:28:18,980 --> 02:28:19,650
you know,

5639
02:28:19,650 --> 02:28:22,130
trying to be as loose
and open as possible.

5640
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:23,990
It's got to be things that don't go great.

5641
02:28:24,050 --> 02:28:24,471
Yes.

5642
02:28:24,471 --> 02:28:25,730
And you have to kind of,

5643
02:28:25,760 --> 02:28:26,510
you know,

5644
02:28:26,510 --> 02:28:29,230
you have to kind of leave
the flaws in sometime.

5645
02:28:29,470 --> 02:28:29,770
And I,

5646
02:28:29,770 --> 02:28:30,440
I,

5647
02:28:30,440 --> 02:28:33,620
one of the things I love
so much about Mike Douglas,

5648
02:28:33,621 --> 02:28:34,130
and this is,

5649
02:28:34,130 --> 02:28:35,570
it was such an imperfect thing.

5650
02:28:35,571 --> 02:28:37,940
Those shows he's going to be
in the Jackson five one time.

5651
02:28:38,270 --> 02:28:39,103
And it was all of them.

5652
02:28:39,410 --> 02:28:42,830
It was just a very slow interview because
they were kids at the time and he said

5653
02:28:42,831 --> 02:28:43,281
to one of them,

5654
02:28:43,281 --> 02:28:43,431
like,

5655
02:28:43,431 --> 02:28:45,140
so I understand you're the prankster.

5656
02:28:45,470 --> 02:28:45,921
And he's like,

5657
02:28:45,921 --> 02:28:47,210
Yanik playing pranks.

5658
02:28:47,810 --> 02:28:48,643
It was like,

5659
02:28:48,830 --> 02:28:50,690
it was such a fucking shit moment,

5660
02:28:51,170 --> 02:28:55,070
but I love the fact that it was real
and they left it in and they didn't fuck

5661
02:28:55,071 --> 02:28:55,371
with it.

5662
02:28:55,371 --> 02:28:59,330
And nowadays they would go back and
they would chop that out to him.

5663
02:28:59,331 --> 02:29:00,350
Gallen Prank cry.

5664
02:29:00,351 --> 02:29:00,531
Yeah,

5665
02:29:00,531 --> 02:29:01,730
I'm Pragar right back.

5666
02:29:01,970 --> 02:29:04,010
And it would be jazzed up and fixed.

5667
02:29:04,460 --> 02:29:08,810
And in that moment it was kind
of like just this is what it is.

5668
02:29:08,840 --> 02:29:10,280
It's a natural flow.

5669
02:29:10,610 --> 02:29:11,660
Great moments,

5670
02:29:11,990 --> 02:29:12,980
slow moments,

5671
02:29:12,981 --> 02:29:14,420
but they're all real moments.

5672
02:29:14,421 --> 02:29:16,310
And I kind of like what you're saying,

5673
02:29:16,640 --> 02:29:19,250
there's going to be little things that
bother you because they're real moments

5674
02:29:19,280 --> 02:29:22,100
and there are a lot of little things
that bother you because you care because

5675
02:29:22,101 --> 02:29:22,730
you want to make it,

5676
02:29:22,730 --> 02:29:23,990
you want it to be great.

5677
02:29:23,991 --> 02:29:27,800
Like I'm way better at doing podcasts now
than it was when I first started doing

5678
02:29:27,801 --> 02:29:29,240
it will bother you in a podcast.

5679
02:29:29,240 --> 02:29:29,491
Like what?

5680
02:29:29,491 --> 02:29:31,550
Like I'm not saying for
like who did a bad one,

5681
02:29:31,730 --> 02:29:33,740
but like what will be a
podcast thing that you're like,

5682
02:29:33,741 --> 02:29:34,281
fuck man,

5683
02:29:34,281 --> 02:29:35,390
that was a bad episode.

5684
02:29:35,391 --> 02:29:38,600
Will be the other person didn't talk
or you didn't get out of them what you

5685
02:29:38,601 --> 02:29:39,230
wanted.

5686
02:29:39,230 --> 02:29:41,390
It could be a mistake having
them on the first place.

5687
02:29:41,450 --> 02:29:42,220
They just,

5688
02:29:42,220 --> 02:29:42,560
you know,

5689
02:29:42,560 --> 02:29:44,600
they're born as interesting as
I thought they were going to be.

5690
02:29:44,630 --> 02:29:47,750
Or we don't see eye to eye
on things and he gets weird,

5691
02:29:47,751 --> 02:29:48,740
which is sometimes fun.

5692
02:29:49,150 --> 02:29:49,930
But uh,

5693
02:29:49,930 --> 02:29:50,810
sometimes some,

5694
02:29:51,020 --> 02:29:51,321
you know,

5695
02:29:51,321 --> 02:29:52,940
I've one of my favorite ones,

5696
02:29:53,380 --> 02:29:54,260
that skeptic guy,

5697
02:29:54,261 --> 02:29:54,831
Brian Dining,

5698
02:29:54,831 --> 02:29:57,350
just cause it was so ridiculously off.

5699
02:29:57,770 --> 02:29:58,790
It was so off.

5700
02:29:59,080 --> 02:30:00,510
Cause he's such a goofy guy.

5701
02:30:00,511 --> 02:30:01,850
He was so fucked in the head.

5702
02:30:01,851 --> 02:30:02,390
This guy,

5703
02:30:02,390 --> 02:30:06,230
it's just his mind was
just so like he would go,

5704
02:30:06,350 --> 02:30:07,240
he would think he was gonna.

5705
02:30:07,250 --> 02:30:12,190
He had a long road ahead of him and he
was just kept going off cliffs and Woo

5706
02:30:12,190 --> 02:30:12,210
Hoo.

5707
02:30:12,210 --> 02:30:14,480
Just something wrong with
the way the guy thinks,

5708
02:30:14,660 --> 02:30:19,660
but sometimes you'll have a podcast and
the guy's just not interesting and I

5709
02:30:19,881 --> 02:30:20,960
just don't connect with them.

5710
02:30:21,260 --> 02:30:22,220
Or maybe it's me.

5711
02:30:22,221 --> 02:30:23,510
Maybe I'm just low energy.

5712
02:30:23,720 --> 02:30:25,880
I've had podcasts where I just,

5713
02:30:25,881 --> 02:30:26,181
you know,

5714
02:30:26,181 --> 02:30:27,530
maybe I was just too exhausted.

5715
02:30:27,790 --> 02:30:29,390
They had been doing too many things.

5716
02:30:29,391 --> 02:30:30,440
That's definitely,

5717
02:30:30,890 --> 02:30:33,920
you have to always manage your energy
and if you're doing too many different

5718
02:30:33,921 --> 02:30:35,090
things at the same time,

5719
02:30:35,150 --> 02:30:36,620
like I do a lot of different things.

5720
02:30:37,150 --> 02:30:37,610
It's,

5721
02:30:37,610 --> 02:30:40,430
it's a matter of making
sure that you have enough.

5722
02:30:40,910 --> 02:30:41,743
Do you ever go back,

5723
02:30:41,930 --> 02:30:42,890
because one of the guys I interviewed,

5724
02:30:42,891 --> 02:30:46,850
one of the episodes is freeway Rick and
I know you and he's fucking fascinating.

5725
02:30:46,851 --> 02:30:47,230
Great.

5726
02:30:47,230 --> 02:30:47,930
But all I think is,

5727
02:30:47,930 --> 02:30:48,740
I should have asked him this.

5728
02:30:48,740 --> 02:30:49,160
I should.

5729
02:30:49,160 --> 02:30:52,700
It's like there's never enough time
to ask everything you want to ask.

5730
02:30:52,950 --> 02:30:53,960
If you ask good questions,

5731
02:30:53,961 --> 02:30:54,561
you're like fuck,

5732
02:30:54,561 --> 02:30:56,660
I had to do was that one and that
one and that one and I missed it.

5733
02:30:56,661 --> 02:30:57,440
I missed it.

5734
02:30:57,440 --> 02:30:58,760
I did two podcasts with them,

5735
02:30:58,761 --> 02:31:01,040
so I did like six hours
where they're talking to him.

5736
02:31:01,490 --> 02:31:01,791
Yeah.

5737
02:31:01,791 --> 02:31:01,931
The,

5738
02:31:01,931 --> 02:31:02,810
the first one though,

5739
02:31:02,811 --> 02:31:06,350
I think we really got to the heart of
everything because it was three hours long

5740
02:31:06,351 --> 02:31:06,711
and you know,

5741
02:31:06,711 --> 02:31:07,970
he told everything,

5742
02:31:07,971 --> 02:31:12,320
the whole CIA connection
to the Iran Contra affair.

5743
02:31:12,321 --> 02:31:15,650
And notice I said Contra corner
that cause I know how to speak.

5744
02:31:15,651 --> 02:31:16,760
I'm very eloquent.

5745
02:31:17,660 --> 02:31:18,493
He was a,

5746
02:31:18,600 --> 02:31:20,010
he was a fascinating guy and

5747
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:21,060
a very positive guy,

5748
02:31:21,061 --> 02:31:21,691
man for God.

5749
02:31:21,691 --> 02:31:23,550
I spent that much time in jail and yeah,

5750
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:28,760
very peaceful and very interesting dude
and really earnestly working to help

5751
02:31:29,821 --> 02:31:31,800
people not make the same
mistakes that he made.

5752
02:31:31,950 --> 02:31:34,200
He said he was a nice man.

5753
02:31:34,250 --> 02:31:34,610
No.

5754
02:31:34,610 --> 02:31:39,420
And so it was hard to me
to picture that guy in the,

5755
02:31:39,421 --> 02:31:40,254
um,

5756
02:31:40,290 --> 02:31:41,850
in the role of kingpin.

5757
02:31:42,420 --> 02:31:43,500
And then as we were,

5758
02:31:43,590 --> 02:31:45,900
we were editing and we weren't
chopping content on this one.

5759
02:31:45,901 --> 02:31:49,050
It was just camera angles because of the
way that I demanded the audience be set

5760
02:31:49,051 --> 02:31:49,530
up.

5761
02:31:49,530 --> 02:31:50,460
You know you have to,

5762
02:31:50,490 --> 02:31:53,070
we couldn't just get a two shot because
I didn't know that because I'm a fucking

5763
02:31:53,071 --> 02:31:53,904
now this cunt.

5764
02:31:53,970 --> 02:31:57,090
So we had to just fix a couple of camera
angles and there's a couple of moments

5765
02:31:57,091 --> 02:31:57,871
for Rick's talking.

5766
02:31:57,871 --> 02:32:00,000
I just saw his face and
he was being pleasant,

5767
02:32:00,450 --> 02:32:01,080
but I'm like,

5768
02:32:01,080 --> 02:32:05,520
oh that's the guy who the king pin,

5769
02:32:05,580 --> 02:32:06,413
that's the guy.

5770
02:32:06,520 --> 02:32:06,900
And then that,

5771
02:32:06,900 --> 02:32:07,980
and then in those moments,

5772
02:32:08,010 --> 02:32:09,570
I actually told the
editor a couple of times,

5773
02:32:09,571 --> 02:32:12,990
rewind that and [inaudible] on his face
and he was just listening and he wasn't

5774
02:32:12,991 --> 02:32:13,800
angry,

5775
02:32:13,800 --> 02:32:16,350
but I saw in that moment that face,

5776
02:32:16,360 --> 02:32:16,650
I'm like,

5777
02:32:16,650 --> 02:32:19,260
that's the guy that fucking
gave the order like in that,

5778
02:32:19,290 --> 02:32:19,741
you know what I mean?

5779
02:32:19,741 --> 02:32:22,140
Like this nice pleasant
man is who he really is.

5780
02:32:22,560 --> 02:32:23,850
But you can't be this nice,

5781
02:32:23,851 --> 02:32:28,320
pleasant man and fucking make
$900 million selling cocaine.

5782
02:32:28,321 --> 02:32:29,610
Isn't it crazy how much you made?

5783
02:32:29,611 --> 02:32:31,110
He made $900 million.

5784
02:32:31,140 --> 02:32:31,973
You can't do it.

5785
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:33,840
You can't be Mr. Nice Guy.

5786
02:32:33,960 --> 02:32:38,070
You can't operate with the bloods and
the crips together and be a nice fucking

5787
02:32:38,071 --> 02:32:39,120
fellow all the time.

5788
02:32:39,121 --> 02:32:40,550
There has to be that other part of you.

5789
02:32:40,650 --> 02:32:42,210
I hope he's making money now.

5790
02:32:42,300 --> 02:32:43,470
I hope he's doing well.

5791
02:32:43,500 --> 02:32:48,500
You know how hard must it be when you've
made $900 million selling drugs to not

5792
02:32:48,871 --> 02:32:50,100
go back to selling drugs?

5793
02:32:50,310 --> 02:32:51,000
So not go,

5794
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,580
I got to figure out a way to
do this and not get caught.

5795
02:32:53,910 --> 02:32:55,580
I wonder if it is that I should again,

5796
02:32:55,590 --> 02:32:57,480
I should have asked him
that but I wonder is also,

5797
02:32:57,481 --> 02:32:59,670
is it cause he got life
without parole learn,

5798
02:32:59,671 --> 02:33:00,060
you know,

5799
02:33:00,060 --> 02:33:01,140
learn to read and now he's out.

5800
02:33:01,380 --> 02:33:02,213
So is it,

5801
02:33:02,250 --> 02:33:05,340
is that overpowered by the fucking
fact that you like you know what,

5802
02:33:05,341 --> 02:33:06,780
I can fuck a woman if I want to.

5803
02:33:07,160 --> 02:33:09,120
I can go get a piece
of pizza if I want to.

5804
02:33:09,121 --> 02:33:13,710
Like this is the gratitude for being
out override the loss of material stuff.

5805
02:33:13,890 --> 02:33:15,240
Oh I'm sure it does.

5806
02:33:15,360 --> 02:33:16,380
I'm sure it does.

5807
02:33:16,410 --> 02:33:18,750
Cause the loss of material stuff
was already out the window anyway.

5808
02:33:18,751 --> 02:33:20,280
He was in jail and I,

5809
02:33:20,310 --> 02:33:20,590
I'm,

5810
02:33:20,590 --> 02:33:21,570
I'm sure he,

5811
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:21,781
well,

5812
02:33:21,781 --> 02:33:23,430
he's also a changed person,

5813
02:33:23,610 --> 02:33:25,650
like a real legitimately changed person,

5814
02:33:25,830 --> 02:33:26,280
you know,

5815
02:33:26,280 --> 02:33:30,030
and the fact that he didn't even know
how to read before he got into jail and

5816
02:33:30,031 --> 02:33:30,990
then he got to jail,

5817
02:33:30,991 --> 02:33:35,130
learned how to read and then found the
legal flaws in the argument against him.

5818
02:33:35,130 --> 02:33:36,270
And that's what got him released.

5819
02:33:36,271 --> 02:33:36,451
I mean,

5820
02:33:36,451 --> 02:33:37,290
that's incredible.

5821
02:33:37,470 --> 02:33:38,610
What happened was lawyers,

5822
02:33:38,790 --> 02:33:43,260
how many like these be paying lawyers
all that money and they don't catch the

5823
02:33:43,261 --> 02:33:43,531
fucking,

5824
02:33:43,531 --> 02:33:43,801
you know,

5825
02:33:43,801 --> 02:33:44,910
it was a three strikes,

5826
02:33:44,911 --> 02:33:46,060
you're out law thing.

5827
02:33:46,390 --> 02:33:47,520
It was a double jeopardy thing.

5828
02:33:48,030 --> 02:33:48,241
Right.

5829
02:33:48,241 --> 02:33:50,430
They counted one of them was
two strikes but was only you,

5830
02:33:50,510 --> 02:33:51,620
it was the same thing twice or something.

5831
02:33:52,230 --> 02:33:53,430
Something along those lines.

5832
02:33:53,470 --> 02:33:54,120
Yeah.

5833
02:33:54,120 --> 02:33:54,540
But he,

5834
02:33:54,540 --> 02:33:57,080
I know he doesn't want
to be that guy anymore,

5835
02:33:57,180 --> 02:33:58,800
which is why he doesn't
sell drugs anymore.

5836
02:33:59,100 --> 02:33:59,401
But,

5837
02:33:59,401 --> 02:33:59,700
uh,

5838
02:33:59,700 --> 02:34:03,870
that's gotta be a weird thing to go
from like Mc Hammer style from having

5839
02:34:03,871 --> 02:34:06,660
hundreds of millions of dollars
to how do I pay my bills?

5840
02:34:07,050 --> 02:34:07,321
Yeah.

5841
02:34:07,321 --> 02:34:08,700
And what do I do from here?

5842
02:34:08,830 --> 02:34:10,990
I bigger than MCM or really what's that?

5843
02:34:11,160 --> 02:34:11,940
Even bigger.

5844
02:34:11,940 --> 02:34:12,091
Yeah.

5845
02:34:12,091 --> 02:34:13,410
Cause MC hammer didn't go to,

5846
02:34:13,530 --> 02:34:15,870
although I think it would mc hammer went
through was harder because he didn't go

5847
02:34:15,871 --> 02:34:17,010
to prison for 20 years.

5848
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:19,930
He's have a 20 year cooling
off period with no women.

5849
02:34:20,260 --> 02:34:24,520
Like you know Mc Hammer just went from
fucking from a private plane with 30

5850
02:34:24,521 --> 02:34:27,070
people to what the fuck do I do now?

5851
02:34:27,071 --> 02:34:30,160
I owe tax money and nothing
that he did it on the outside.

5852
02:34:30,460 --> 02:34:34,270
Whereas Rick Ross had a lot of years of
like this sucks to kind of get his life

5853
02:34:34,271 --> 02:34:35,410
and then then be grateful.

5854
02:34:35,470 --> 02:34:37,480
What does it Galaxy Mc
Hammer do for money?

5855
02:34:37,570 --> 02:34:38,403
I don't know.

5856
02:34:38,680 --> 02:34:39,430
With Google,

5857
02:34:39,430 --> 02:34:40,030
I don't know.

5858
02:34:40,030 --> 02:34:40,801
What do I mean what?

5859
02:34:40,801 --> 02:34:43,900
What would you do if you were a guy
like mc hammer and all of a sudden the

5860
02:34:43,901 --> 02:34:45,070
fucking the Gig is up.

5861
02:34:45,400 --> 02:34:47,100
They didn't even do the
religious thing for awhile.

5862
02:34:47,740 --> 02:34:48,573
Yes.

5863
02:34:48,580 --> 02:34:50,740
Going to be a pastor of a
church or something like that.

5864
02:34:50,741 --> 02:34:51,160
Yeah,

5865
02:34:51,160 --> 02:34:54,400
I guess he's got a block of
money that way or something.

5866
02:34:54,580 --> 02:34:57,790
It's got a blog but he hasn't
updated it since 2013 November.

5867
02:34:57,850 --> 02:35:00,640
That's not good for blogging
on the surreal life.

5868
02:35:00,730 --> 02:35:00,971
Oh,

5869
02:35:00,971 --> 02:35:01,804
was he really?

5870
02:35:02,230 --> 02:35:03,063
Three,

5871
02:35:03,520 --> 02:35:04,360
he was managing,

5872
02:35:04,580 --> 02:35:05,050
um,

5873
02:35:05,050 --> 02:35:06,540
martial artists for a while.

5874
02:35:07,360 --> 02:35:10,990
He had some company that he
was managing martial artists.

5875
02:35:11,230 --> 02:35:13,540
What's it think it was called in
Alchemy or something like that?

5876
02:35:14,730 --> 02:35:15,130
Yeah.

5877
02:35:15,130 --> 02:35:16,420
I wouldn't trust him with my money.

5878
02:35:17,200 --> 02:35:18,130
Yeah.

5879
02:35:18,190 --> 02:35:22,120
If you go through fucking 30 million and
I get broke or whatever the amount was,

5880
02:35:22,121 --> 02:35:24,980
I don't want to trust you
with my financial decisions.

5881
02:35:24,990 --> 02:35:26,830
It wasn't an even crazier than that.

5882
02:35:26,831 --> 02:35:31,831
Like he was spending like ungodly amounts
of money to like refurbish this house

5883
02:35:32,561 --> 02:35:35,650
and then they had to stop halfway
through it cause he ran out of money.

5884
02:35:36,040 --> 02:35:38,170
But it was just some insane thing.

5885
02:35:38,171 --> 02:35:43,171
Like the marble alone was like $8 million
worth of Italian marble or something.

5886
02:35:43,481 --> 02:35:44,320
Fucking crazy.

5887
02:35:44,410 --> 02:35:44,651
Yeah.

5888
02:35:44,651 --> 02:35:49,651
It's really crazy how people like how
fast expense I had shelves built recently.

5889
02:35:50,550 --> 02:35:52,240
And why wouldn't they
be problems with them?

5890
02:35:52,241 --> 02:35:54,850
Because whatever fucking cunt
face does something cultured,

5891
02:35:54,851 --> 02:35:55,684
it falls apart.

5892
02:35:56,050 --> 02:35:57,450
So now the shelves are not there.

5893
02:35:57,490 --> 02:35:58,301
They're being rewritten,

5894
02:35:58,301 --> 02:35:59,134
spared.

5895
02:35:59,290 --> 02:36:00,123
Um,

5896
02:36:00,490 --> 02:36:00,851
you know,

5897
02:36:00,851 --> 02:36:01,421
and it's like you,

5898
02:36:01,421 --> 02:36:04,000
you just realize that they give you
an estimate and he always goes more,

5899
02:36:04,010 --> 02:36:04,120
well,

5900
02:36:04,120 --> 02:36:05,260
he gets to be more and you're like,

5901
02:36:05,261 --> 02:36:05,590
well,

5902
02:36:05,590 --> 02:36:06,490
you're already in a little bit.

5903
02:36:06,491 --> 02:36:07,540
You can't just stop.

5904
02:36:08,160 --> 02:36:08,920
Yeah,

5905
02:36:08,920 --> 02:36:09,340
yeah.

5906
02:36:09,340 --> 02:36:11,200
Well that's the thing they do to you.

5907
02:36:11,530 --> 02:36:12,101
That's the thing.

5908
02:36:12,101 --> 02:36:12,521
If a,

5909
02:36:12,521 --> 02:36:14,300
especially unscrupulous contractor,

5910
02:36:14,301 --> 02:36:15,134
sometimes it's just,

5911
02:36:15,220 --> 02:36:15,551
you know,

5912
02:36:15,551 --> 02:36:16,181
hidden costs,

5913
02:36:16,181 --> 02:36:16,931
they don't see comment.

5914
02:36:16,931 --> 02:36:18,280
But some of them they just,

5915
02:36:18,281 --> 02:36:20,650
they get you hooked and then
once they got you hooked,

5916
02:36:20,651 --> 02:36:21,790
they just keep the bills coming.

5917
02:36:21,940 --> 02:36:25,240
They do that with car builds to
when you're getting a car built.

5918
02:36:25,270 --> 02:36:28,450
They did that to me when I was on that
show rides where had that Barracuda

5919
02:36:28,451 --> 02:36:29,200
built.

5920
02:36:29,200 --> 02:36:30,670
It was infuriating,

5921
02:36:30,671 --> 02:36:30,970
man.

5922
02:36:30,970 --> 02:36:32,710
They treat you like you're a sucker.

5923
02:36:32,740 --> 02:36:33,521
Keep adding to it,

5924
02:36:33,521 --> 02:36:33,790
right?

5925
02:36:33,790 --> 02:36:34,031
Oh,

5926
02:36:34,031 --> 02:36:35,200
they treat you like you're a sucker.

5927
02:36:35,430 --> 02:36:37,360
They give you a low ball figure.

5928
02:36:37,361 --> 02:36:41,200
And then we were past that low ball
figure quick and the car was nowhere near

5929
02:36:41,201 --> 02:36:42,034
being finished.

5930
02:36:42,070 --> 02:36:42,461
And I was like,

5931
02:36:42,461 --> 02:36:42,701
guys,

5932
02:36:42,701 --> 02:36:43,451
what's going on?

5933
02:36:43,451 --> 02:36:43,771
Like what?

5934
02:36:43,771 --> 02:36:44,604
What are you doing?

5935
02:36:45,040 --> 02:36:45,671
And they were like,

5936
02:36:45,671 --> 02:36:45,881
hey,

5937
02:36:45,881 --> 02:36:46,211
you know,

5938
02:36:46,211 --> 02:36:46,571
it's a,

5939
02:36:46,571 --> 02:36:47,740
it's costing a little
more than we thought.

5940
02:36:47,770 --> 02:36:50,140
It's costing $100,000 more.

5941
02:36:50,320 --> 02:36:50,860
Wow.

5942
02:36:50,860 --> 02:36:51,700
You guys are like,

5943
02:36:51,701 --> 02:36:53,170
what the fuck is going on?

5944
02:36:53,410 --> 02:36:55,270
And they started talking about,

5945
02:36:55,271 --> 02:36:55,511
look,

5946
02:36:55,511 --> 02:36:55,721
you know,

5947
02:36:55,721 --> 02:36:56,410
we'll sell it.

5948
02:36:56,410 --> 02:36:56,621
You know,

5949
02:36:56,621 --> 02:36:58,090
we'll sell it and we'll
give you your money back.

5950
02:36:58,091 --> 02:37:00,460
Like no the fuck you
won't now that's my car.

5951
02:37:00,580 --> 02:37:01,360
You're not going to sell.

5952
02:37:01,360 --> 02:37:04,420
Because it was on the cover of
popular hot rodding or one of those,

5953
02:37:04,610 --> 02:37:04,930
you know,

5954
02:37:04,930 --> 02:37:05,800
hot rod magazine,

5955
02:37:05,801 --> 02:37:06,640
a couple of different magazines.

5956
02:37:06,641 --> 02:37:08,320
So they were getting offers people like,

5957
02:37:08,321 --> 02:37:08,711
hey Ya,

5958
02:37:08,711 --> 02:37:08,890
you know,

5959
02:37:08,890 --> 02:37:09,641
I want to see this car.

5960
02:37:09,641 --> 02:37:11,290
I'd Bob all this car as this guy,

5961
02:37:11,440 --> 02:37:12,340
he wants to sell the car.

5962
02:37:12,460 --> 02:37:13,690
And they started getting greedy.

5963
02:37:13,840 --> 02:37:16,040
So they started like doing
all this crazy shit to the

5964
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:17,540
car to can make it more valuable.

5965
02:37:17,690 --> 02:37:18,650
But while they were doing that,

5966
02:37:18,651 --> 02:37:20,060
it was costing me more money.

5967
02:37:20,330 --> 02:37:23,270
I was financing the whole thing and then
they were threatening to sell it and

5968
02:37:23,271 --> 02:37:26,150
just give me my money back and they
were going to like make all the profit.

5969
02:37:26,151 --> 02:37:26,660
I was like,

5970
02:37:26,660 --> 02:37:28,220
you guys are comments like,

5971
02:37:28,221 --> 02:37:28,820
this is cool.

5972
02:37:28,820 --> 02:37:30,890
This is the craziest
fucking scenario I'm in.

5973
02:37:31,370 --> 02:37:33,800
And it was just like they do with a house,

5974
02:37:33,801 --> 02:37:35,950
except it's different
because it's your house,

5975
02:37:35,951 --> 02:37:36,260
right?

5976
02:37:36,260 --> 02:37:37,730
Like this isn't even your car.

5977
02:37:37,900 --> 02:37:39,200
Like this is a car that you're paying for.

5978
02:37:39,201 --> 02:37:40,100
And this guy's telling me,

5979
02:37:40,220 --> 02:37:40,701
hey look,

5980
02:37:40,701 --> 02:37:42,440
if you don't want to
spend x amount of money,

5981
02:37:42,441 --> 02:37:44,600
we'll sell it and we'll
give you your money back.

5982
02:37:44,601 --> 02:37:46,100
Like the fuck you will.

5983
02:37:46,130 --> 02:37:47,120
How'd you find the resolve it?

5984
02:37:47,690 --> 02:37:48,400
Uh,

5985
02:37:48,400 --> 02:37:48,801
well,

5986
02:37:48,801 --> 02:37:53,801
the production company got involved and
it got pretty ugly because they ripped

5987
02:37:53,871 --> 02:37:54,620
him off to,

5988
02:37:54,620 --> 02:37:54,981
it was,

5989
02:37:54,981 --> 02:37:55,790
it was pretty bad.

5990
02:37:55,790 --> 02:37:56,750
The guy who built it,

5991
02:37:56,780 --> 02:37:57,740
he made some mistakes.

5992
02:37:58,340 --> 02:37:58,911
It was a,

5993
02:37:58,911 --> 02:37:59,780
it was a disaster.

5994
02:37:59,810 --> 02:38:01,180
It wasn't chip Foose
who was the other guy.

5995
02:38:01,550 --> 02:38:02,383
It was a mess.

5996
02:38:02,510 --> 02:38:03,171
It was a mess,

5997
02:38:03,171 --> 02:38:06,590
a real mess because a bunch of people
got really greedy because it was,

5998
02:38:06,620 --> 02:38:08,690
the car was getting a
tremendous amount of attention.

5999
02:38:09,120 --> 02:38:09,710
It,

6000
02:38:09,710 --> 02:38:10,543
it was ugly.

6001
02:38:11,660 --> 02:38:12,490
I don't know.

6002
02:38:12,490 --> 02:38:13,500
They got cut out of,

6003
02:38:13,501 --> 02:38:14,240
uh,

6004
02:38:14,240 --> 02:38:15,890
my friend Bud's production company though,

6005
02:38:15,891 --> 02:38:17,960
who does overhaul and he
does a bunch of the shows.

6006
02:38:17,961 --> 02:38:19,370
He cut him off forever.

6007
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:20,151
It's like done.

6008
02:38:20,151 --> 02:38:20,984
You're done dude.

6009
02:38:21,100 --> 02:38:22,010
You're cut off forever.

6010
02:38:22,140 --> 02:38:23,390
People just don't see the big picture.

6011
02:38:23,391 --> 02:38:23,660
Right?

6012
02:38:23,660 --> 02:38:24,550
They don't know.

6013
02:38:24,580 --> 02:38:24,831
I mean,

6014
02:38:24,831 --> 02:38:28,340
he was all these dollar bill signs are
in his head because it was on these

6015
02:38:28,341 --> 02:38:30,950
magazine covers and we had
this conversation on the phone.

6016
02:38:30,951 --> 02:38:31,191
He's like,

6017
02:38:31,191 --> 02:38:31,401
look,

6018
02:38:31,401 --> 02:38:31,671
you know,

6019
02:38:31,671 --> 02:38:33,050
this car is a popular car.

6020
02:38:33,050 --> 02:38:33,830
Cars on today.

6021
02:38:33,830 --> 02:38:34,101
I go,

6022
02:38:34,101 --> 02:38:34,251
Hey,

6023
02:38:34,251 --> 02:38:34,821
fuck head.

6024
02:38:34,821 --> 02:38:37,610
Why do you think this car is so much
more popular than any car you ever built?

6025
02:38:37,910 --> 02:38:40,220
You ever think it's maybe because
you're building it for a famous person,

6026
02:38:40,430 --> 02:38:41,600
you fucking dolt.

6027
02:38:42,150 --> 02:38:43,160
Did you not see that?

6028
02:38:43,161 --> 02:38:44,480
You think that you're the famous person?

6029
02:38:44,481 --> 02:38:44,840
Like,

6030
02:38:44,840 --> 02:38:45,770
do you understand this?

6031
02:38:45,771 --> 02:38:47,900
Like this is getting you more attention,

6032
02:38:47,901 --> 02:38:50,510
that more attention will
generate more business for you,

6033
02:38:50,870 --> 02:38:52,760
but we have a deal and you,

6034
02:38:52,761 --> 02:38:55,640
you're fucking me out of my deal because
someone's going to offer you an extra

6035
02:38:55,790 --> 02:38:58,730
$30,000 or whatever this
other person was offering him.

6036
02:38:59,210 --> 02:39:00,770
But that's what they do with cars.

6037
02:39:00,771 --> 02:39:01,770
They start you off this,

6038
02:39:01,771 --> 02:39:02,031
say,

6039
02:39:02,031 --> 02:39:02,271
you know,

6040
02:39:02,271 --> 02:39:03,230
we'll build the car for you,

6041
02:39:03,231 --> 02:39:03,800
Jimmy,

6042
02:39:03,800 --> 02:39:04,141
Kashi,

6043
02:39:04,141 --> 02:39:04,971
she about 20,

6044
02:39:04,971 --> 02:39:05,750
30 grand,

6045
02:39:05,750 --> 02:39:06,211
but prepare,

6046
02:39:06,211 --> 02:39:06,860
prepare,

6047
02:39:06,860 --> 02:39:07,401
and then you know,

6048
02:39:07,401 --> 02:39:08,240
you've got the car.

6049
02:39:08,241 --> 02:39:09,011
And then like Jim,

6050
02:39:09,011 --> 02:39:09,960
I'm the trainees,

6051
02:39:09,980 --> 02:39:10,850
a little more expensive.

6052
02:39:10,850 --> 02:39:13,850
We're going to have to adjust the
housing and the rear end's not good.

6053
02:39:13,851 --> 02:39:14,870
We're gonna have to add a new rear end.

6054
02:39:14,990 --> 02:39:16,340
And some of that stuff's legitimate,

6055
02:39:16,520 --> 02:39:18,090
but some of it is like a Hee Hee.

6056
02:39:18,091 --> 02:39:18,621
Ha Ha.

6057
02:39:18,621 --> 02:39:19,370
We gotcha.

6058
02:39:19,370 --> 02:39:20,480
Excellent example by the way,

6059
02:39:21,170 --> 02:39:22,640
training and the training.

6060
02:39:23,130 --> 02:39:23,963
And He,

6061
02:39:24,510 --> 02:39:24,831
I know,

6062
02:39:24,831 --> 02:39:26,390
I didn't even mean that those things.

6063
02:39:26,391 --> 02:39:29,000
And in that way it wasn't
meant to be a double entendre,

6064
02:39:29,390 --> 02:39:29,631
but,

6065
02:39:29,631 --> 02:39:29,811
uh,

6066
02:39:29,811 --> 02:39:31,190
it fell into place correctly.

6067
02:39:31,370 --> 02:39:32,181
But yeah,

6068
02:39:32,181 --> 02:39:32,331
I,

6069
02:39:32,331 --> 02:39:33,420
I'm in the middle of a,

6070
02:39:33,650 --> 02:39:35,630
a thing with my house that's going great.

6071
02:39:35,660 --> 02:39:36,051
And when,

6072
02:39:36,051 --> 02:39:36,321
you know,

6073
02:39:36,321 --> 02:39:39,260
you have something fixed in your house
and someone's doing it and they're doing

6074
02:39:39,261 --> 02:39:41,210
a great job and it's all on time,

6075
02:39:41,390 --> 02:39:41,991
it's beautiful.

6076
02:39:41,991 --> 02:39:42,680
It's like,

6077
02:39:42,680 --> 02:39:43,161
ah,

6078
02:39:43,161 --> 02:39:45,590
the guy did what he said he was going
to do and everything's working out well.

6079
02:39:45,591 --> 02:39:46,240
It's like it's,

6080
02:39:46,240 --> 02:39:47,390
it's like relaxing.

6081
02:39:47,391 --> 02:39:48,290
He didn't know it.

6082
02:39:48,440 --> 02:39:49,310
He didn't fuck me.

6083
02:39:49,700 --> 02:39:50,533
I'm going to ask it again.

6084
02:39:51,170 --> 02:39:51,441
Wow.

6085
02:39:51,441 --> 02:39:52,271
This is incredible.

6086
02:39:52,271 --> 02:39:53,120
This is the third time.

6087
02:39:53,121 --> 02:39:53,860
This is incredible.

6088
02:39:53,860 --> 02:39:54,770
Let's just wrap this thing up.

6089
02:39:54,771 --> 02:39:55,041
We're done.

6090
02:39:55,041 --> 02:39:55,340
Anyway,

6091
02:39:55,340 --> 02:39:55,731
all I done.

6092
02:39:55,731 --> 02:39:55,971
Okay,

6093
02:39:55,971 --> 02:39:56,450
we're done.

6094
02:39:56,450 --> 02:40:01,450

02:40:27,030 --> 02:40:28,410
