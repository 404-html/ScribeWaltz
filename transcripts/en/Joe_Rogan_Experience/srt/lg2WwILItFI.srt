Hello Freak bitches.
If you didn't work with people because 

2
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:08,520
of their private life and things you 
didn't agree with,

3
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:11,250
you would never work with anybody.
What you imagine their mess,

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,440
you have to sit down with them and go 
over their private life.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,960
Okay.
Have you ever lied to a cop?

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,010
Right?
Right.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,670
Have you ever lied about speeding,
but you ever not paid your taxes?

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,533
Now let's get into your sex life.
Do you ever think about other people 

9
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:29,451
when you come?
Okay,

10
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:32,034
this meeting is over.
I had a buddy of mine that actually got 

11
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:35,280
an argument like that with his 
girlfriend.

12
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:36,114
She was like,
my friend says that guy's fantasize 

13
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:39,720
about other women while they're having 
sex with your girlfriend.

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,160
Is that true?
And he was like,

15
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:43,290
well sometimes she's like,
you fucking piece of shit.

16
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,540
She got really mad at him.
Right.

17
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,501
And I'm like,
when I,

18
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:48,480
I don't remember thinking about it like,
why do you care?

19
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:49,643
I guess if your wife was just thinking 
about just getting stuffed by some big 

20
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:54,654
ass country football player,
some big dude with like chewing tobacco 

21
00:00:57,481 --> 00:01:00,240
in his mouth and a fucking rebel flag 
hat on.

22
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:01,074
He's just laying pipe on her and that's 
what you're thinking about when you 

23
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,940
fucker,
she's thinking about some corn Fred.

24
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,610
Imagine,
right?

25
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,530
Yeah.
But it'd be like,

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,393
Oh fuck man.
But that's why you don't ask the 

27
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:15,510
question.
That's why you don't ask.

28
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:17,400
You'll probably,
there probably is happening,

29
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,100
but you don't ask if,
if you really love your wife,

30
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:20,934
you want to know everything about her.
You want to know everything when she's 

31
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:29,130
disappointed.
Oh my God,

32
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,060
you,
I love you honey.

33
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:31,770
But I hate that face you make when you 
come.

34
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,320
You make me disgusted.
That's why I'm all fuck you.

35
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,300
You just walk into the kitchen in the 
morning,

36
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:37,830
honey,
what are you thinking?

37
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,220
So next time you fucker just wear a 
luchador mask or even better yet,

38
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:43,630
like Godzilla.
Oh,

39
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,810
rubber Godzilla.
Hey,

40
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,980
fantasies are weird man.
Because like I can't,

41
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,210
I remember when I was in high school,
there was a,

42
00:01:55,211 --> 00:01:56,044
a,
a guy who was writing for the Newton 

43
00:01:57,991 --> 00:02:01,140
south high school paper who wrote this 
cool thing about the boy scouts.

44
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,790
And I remember reading this because I 
was in the boy scouts briefly as a young

45
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:09,090
teenager and they have,
you know the tenants like trustworthy,

46
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:10,860
loyal,
thrifty,

47
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:11,694
clean,
reverent and like one of the things 

48
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,480
about what the voice boy scouts were 
supposed to do is keep your mind pure,

49
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,340
right?
Keep your thoughts pure.

50
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,070
And this guy was like,
who wrote this article?

51
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:23,904
And obviously this is in high school in 
the 1980s guy was pretty brilliant and 

52
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:28,554
he was like,
I don't like the idea of anyone telling 

53
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:31,914
me what I can and can't do with my 
thoughts because sometimes my thoughts 

54
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:34,854
are fun.
Right.

55
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,950
I like to explore the idea of thinking 
about and his argument in this newspaper

56
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:41,454
and I'm like grossly paraphrasing him 
cause again this is like from 1982 or 

57
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:45,774
something like that.
He was like you like you don't need to 

58
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:49,800
know what's going on in my thoughts.

59
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,460
You just needed to know how I act,
how I act is important,

60
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:55,990
not what I think.
So tell me to keep my thoughts pure.

61
00:02:55,991 --> 00:02:58,470
It's like my thoughts are mine right 
there.

62
00:02:58,471 --> 00:02:59,500
Mine.
I do what want with them.

63
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,393
That's right.
So if you girlfriend is just thinking 

64
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:02,494
about that big country fucker,
a piece of wheat coming out of the 

65
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:09,940
corner of his mouth,
Nazi Tattoo on the back of his neck,

66
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:13,120
just laying good dick.
God bless her fat Dick.

67
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:13,954
God bless her,
whatever she's into like a sailor's 

68
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:18,130
forearm.
I am not asking.

69
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:18,890
Yeah,
I mean,

70
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:19,723
do you have moments like in your 
relationship where you know you're with 

71
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:23,020
each other for your life?
This is,

72
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,153
this is a long time thing.
I feel like we should meet and the 

73
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,000
Seattle music.
It was when you're all of a sudden,

74
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:28,420
oh no,
no,

75
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,280
no,
do it.

76
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,543
Jamie went to get some incredible hulk 
walkaway music and there's times when 

77
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:38,584
you were into her and that's it.
There's times when you know there's 

78
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:42,634
times when all of a sudden you,
you about to say this times when she's 

79
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:46,630
not in the EU.
Yes.

80
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,510
Unacceptable walk.
Be a man.

81
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,463
Suck it up.
There's times not that psyched with me 

82
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:56,200
right now to Casey knee Tan with a 
boner.

83
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,320
You chew to Viagra.
You get your Dick hard as a rock.

84
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,940
I'm not saying you don't do those 
things.

85
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,140
What I'm saying is you don't ask her why
you don't ask what?

86
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,600
What is it like?
You don't want to know these things.

87
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,070
I don't want to know why she's unhappy.
I want to know.

88
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,580
I just want her to keep her thoughts to 
herself.

89
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,420
If she's bang some big redneck in a 
truck stop.

90
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,081
No,
you don't want,

91
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:25,270
I don't want anything.
You don't want to know if she's actually

92
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:27,670
being or thinking about bang.
I don't want to know anything.

93
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,470
You don't want anything?
Oh No.

94
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,580
What a good husband.
You want her to just be a good mom,

95
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,793
a good wife and eat my bread and eat.
And how about she cooks something once 

96
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:42,610
in a while.
Why my baking bread?

97
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,880
Like I'm an old lady.
Why am I running around with a flower on

98
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:48,814
my shirt?

99
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,483
Okay.
