1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,940
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,740
Just because we're trying to sell you the
best shit possible at the lowest price

3
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:08,270
possible.

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,970
That is the number one goal with on
it and everything we sell you is shit.

5
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:13,680
We use kettle bells.

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,693
No scarves.

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:14,890
Yeah,

8
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,630
mom against old dudes with scarves
and like it was big Randy coture fan,

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,800
but he's been wearing a scarf lately
and I just want to talk to him.

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,140
Randy couture was such a bad one.

11
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,280
The fucking to turn it around his night,

12
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,090
who cares about like it being a leotard
and I'd still be like stay away from it.

13
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:33,690
He could go out to clubs with a real
legitimate albatross around his neck and

14
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:34,524
you wouldn't care.

15
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,161
Speaking of which,

16
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:38,550
did you see Matt Mcconney and Magic Mike?

17
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:38,761
No,

18
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:39,270
I missed that.

19
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,640
I never met anybody who wouldn't have
sex with themselves more that guy.

20
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,320
Oh God.

21
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,161
I mean he,

22
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:44,821
I guarantee you.

23
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:45,061
Jerks.

24
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:46,020
Officer's highlight reel.

25
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:51,030
He basically has just stock footage of
him stretching his character or Matt

26
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,134
mcconaughey talking about,

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,010
Hey,

28
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:53,660
the human,

29
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,150
how do you watch these actors?

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,700
It's like,

31
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,700
why didn't you take that
role and take that role?

32
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,640
You took that role so you could
wear outfits and go and go.

33
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,311
That's what he does.

34
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:06,031
And then I,

35
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:07,140
I've never seen it very well.

36
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:08,010
Now I have to go see it.

37
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,220
Dude.

38
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,053
It's a bigger issue.

39
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,380
We're talking about the commercials.

40
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:10,831
We let's,

41
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:11,350
let's talk about,

42
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,541
sorry,

43
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:11,741
sorry.

44
00:01:11,741 --> 00:01:12,030
Sorry.

45
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,060
Cause I need to know about this cause I
saw the ad for that and I got a little

46
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:15,750
panicky.

47
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,230
Oh No.

48
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,431
Yeah,

49
00:01:16,431 --> 00:01:16,531
it's,

50
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:18,120
we're so gay that I was like,

51
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:18,990
what's going on here?

52
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:19,441
What is this?

53
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:19,770
Tatum,

54
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,510
Tatum O'Neal or whatever
the guy's name is.

55
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:22,850
He's awesome,

56
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:23,580
handsome fella.

57
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,400
He couldn't look better.

58
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:24,700
Oh,

59
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:24,970
handsome.

60
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:25,411
This guy.

61
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:28,710
I hung out with him in Vegas for a
weekend and women literally stopped just

62
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:30,780
obviating and his presence
and he's a great guy.

63
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:31,643
They must panic.

64
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,570
There's certain types of comedy where,

65
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:33,931
you know,

66
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:35,850
you and I were talking also about how,

67
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,800
what a privilege it is to feel it,

68
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:41,370
to be a headliner and to be somebody
who gets to perform all of the country.

69
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,130
And like sometimes I look at it,

70
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:44,910
I was in Miami and Fort
Lauderdale and I just,

71
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,301
you know,

72
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:45,750
it was a,

73
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,450
I did,

74
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,550
I got at one point,

75
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:50,090
I just had them going pretty
strong and I just looked at it.

76
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,341
I was like,

77
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:52,740
I felt like the luckiest human
being in the fucking world.

78
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:57,741
That's why when I watch Matt Mcconahey
fucking Magic Mike and he's fucking

79
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,440
leather chest girdle and it's fucking
hot pants and any and he's coming off

80
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:04,650
stage.

81
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,970
I did it.

82
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:07,260
Hey,

83
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,250
hey yoker boy,

84
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,590
come fucking do 10 minutes of stand up.

85
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:11,430
You fucking idiot.

86
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,320
I don't jump off stage like I just
did an hour and a half and crush.

87
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,560
Somebody hugged me hard
so I can kiss your mouth.

88
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,490
This animosity,

89
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,280
I'm attracted to him.

90
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:21,114
All right.

91
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:21,920
I mean,

92
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,351
I hate him.

93
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:22,921
I mean I hate him.

94
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:23,790
I mean I hate him.

95
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,230
No,

96
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,390
I was just thinking about how you know,

97
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:26,940
you're,

98
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,780
you're an actor and you,

99
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:30,030
you have five scenes
in a movie and be like,

100
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:30,361
Whoa,

101
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:31,260
you were great in that movie.

102
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,250
[inaudible]

103
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,720
collectively are probably doing 10
or 15 minutes of actual activity.

104
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,010
Whereas when you do stand up,

105
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:38,700
you're up there for,

106
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,120
you know,

107
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,080
it's just a different,

108
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,280
it's just a different thing.

109
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:41,851
It feels,

110
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:42,530
it feels a little,

111
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,370
why would you care though
that he wants to be?

112
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,930
Cause I mean him so much and as
a matter what's going on now.

113
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:50,190
I just saw the movie and I was just,

114
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:50,911
I was just looking at,

115
00:02:50,911 --> 00:02:51,210
I'm going,

116
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:51,660
you're just,

117
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,220
you took this movie just so you could
wear those outfits and biggest Boehner.

118
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,880
Did he?

119
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,431
He,

120
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:56,971
he did.

121
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:57,480
If I was,

122
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,410
if I was gay,

123
00:02:58,411 --> 00:02:59,200
I would definitely,

124
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,740
he's a very attractive man.

125
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,271
Would you choose,

126
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:02,230
I appreciate Mike.

127
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,520
All Channing Tatum.

128
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:03,821
Really?

129
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:04,280
That's my boy,

130
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,040
right?

131
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,361
You Kid,

132
00:03:05,361 --> 00:03:06,131
he's got a full mouth.

133
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:06,964
Best genetics.

134
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,290
He's got thick lips.

135
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,660
Nice skin.

136
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,361
The eyes on him.

137
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:12,390
The cat eyes seems confident too.

138
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,300
He's a great guy.

139
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:14,100
He's got a big car.

140
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,980
Sense of humor.

141
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,080
Jesus were both released something.

142
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,850
Joe Rogan and Brock Callen gays and gets
talking about Channing Tatum was so,

143
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,740
did you want you to send that
one that just came out of here?

144
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,620
I bet he's got a big dot on a big cock.

145
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,180
Did you,

146
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,013
did you watch the,

147
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,190
the actual whole movie?

148
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:30,401
Yeah,

149
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:30,641
because,

150
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:30,731
yeah,

151
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:32,350
because I wanted to know
myself more and more.

152
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,560
Although I thought the movie
was good and I liked that.

153
00:03:34,561 --> 00:03:35,140
I liked,

154
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,070
I liked Channing Tatum.

155
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,780
I mean I had my hands.

156
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,290
That movie looks so gay that I
was flipping through the channels.

157
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,230
I was flipping through
the channels and I saw it.

158
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,380
It popped up and I went,

159
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:44,801
Whoa,

160
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:46,420
change a quick like,

161
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:48,740
you know how you're flipping
through like you have preview,

162
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,900
next preview.

163
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,330
I get in a hotel,

164
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,530
it was chilling at a
hotel and there's like,

165
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,011
I was like,

166
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:54,790
this is so gay.

167
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,623
I can get it off.

168
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,690
Like dudes were like s
gyrating back and forth.

169
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,480
Which by the way,

170
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,480
I don't think women like that.

171
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:04,030
I think that motion is
really just isolated.

172
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:05,170
Someone Riding Dicks.

173
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,341
I don't think that,

174
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:09,160
I know gyrating like the
way a guy's doing it.

175
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,660
Women like the rusting,

176
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:11,750
they like to get fucked.

177
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,520
They don't,

178
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,131
they want you,

179
00:04:13,131 --> 00:04:16,780
you're are you Dick Riding circled man.

180
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,401
Dick Riding,

181
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:19,510
sweaty circle moon.

182
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,380
Makani he's doing,

183
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:25,180
he's got a fucking a leather thong and
he's doing back bends and shaving and,

184
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,380
but the character I was watching,

185
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:26,710
I was,

186
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,730
what bothered me was I was watching,

187
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:28,180
I go,

188
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:28,740
you know,

189
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,000
um,

190
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,830
that's an actor.

191
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,230
If I took that role there,

192
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:31,871
there's a lot.

193
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,621
I do have that role.

194
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:32,980
Maybe,

195
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,340
but I wouldn't because there's not a lot
to do like he played at just one note.

196
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:37,370
Shut the fuck up bitch.

197
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,020
She would take that role on a god heart.

198
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,170
You and Channing Tatum
and your underwear can,

199
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,330
that guy would be your boyfriend.

200
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:45,850
He be carrying around
like he was crossing the,

201
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:49,270
the wedding nuptials I would look like
I have fucking rickets next to that guy,

202
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:50,150
so I don't want to deal with,

203
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,831
do the movie with him.

204
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:50,961
No,

205
00:04:50,961 --> 00:04:51,310
dude,

206
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:51,940
you would do it.

207
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,840
So shut the fuck up.

208
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,350
You've given Matthew Mcconaughey a
hard time and you're doing the movie.

209
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:57,910
Maybe he just wanted to
meet Jenny channel to

210
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,340
Matthew.

211
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,173
I'm sorry,

212
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,290
I don't mean to put you down.

213
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,090
He's kind of like a nice enough guy.

214
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,310
I hear he's a very nice guy.

215
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:06,611
Yeah.

216
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:07,151
Here's the Nice car.

217
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:09,370
It doesn't mean he's not really
vain and not an annoying,

218
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,031
well,

219
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:10,451
listen man,

220
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:11,284
he's playing a part.

221
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,680
How could you like if you
judged me based on the movies,

222
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:14,291
zookeeper,

223
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:18,550
you'd push ups by the
fucking conveyance in Malibu.

224
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,410
He does with his shirt off.

225
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:20,531
No,

226
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:20,920
it doesn't.

227
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,240
It does.

228
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:25,210
If I see you and you're doing pushups
in front of the pavilion in Malibu,

229
00:05:25,211 --> 00:05:26,290
I'm going to take your back.

230
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,153
That's right.

231
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,930
I'm going to take you back and I'm
going to get their hooks in my fryer.

232
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:30,840
Just kick him in the ribs.

233
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,600
I'm just going to hold.

234
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,560
He can scream all you want.

235
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:33,830
You shouldn't have been doing pushups.

236
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,040
Do that with a knapsack on,

237
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,510
with a knapsack on and a Bandana.

238
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:39,190
Wah Wah tourists take pictures of you.

239
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,083
Is that what he was doing?

240
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,530
That annoys me.

241
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,300
He wanted to be really fit for this movie.

242
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,400
Maybe it was like something
he was white working on.

243
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:49,510
Like what kind of exhibitionist could he
become because he was playing a part in

244
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:49,841
a movie,

245
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:50,260
man.

246
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,891
Did you murder?

247
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:52,030
He could look,

248
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:52,864
think about liquid.

249
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,580
What's his name does when he does.

250
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,220
Um,

251
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:55,330
uh,

252
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,021
Daniel Day Lewis,

253
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:57,350
when he gets immersed in a role,

254
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,210
I mean he's unbelievably immersive.

255
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:00,560
Maybe that's where Matthew
mcconaughey was done.

256
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:01,630
It was just being a douchebag.

257
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,770
He's playing a Douche
bag in the movie man.

258
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:04,920
And that's douchebag activity.

259
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,530
Have the role was in so
much of a Douche bag.

260
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:07,281
The role was more of a,

261
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:08,720
just think he's supposed
to be the club owner,

262
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:09,740
but you'll see what I mean.

263
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:11,950
Would it be okay if he
did pushups in a way,

264
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,690
in a place where nobody could
say like say if it was like his,

265
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,540
there was like some grass in front of
his car and nobody could see and he

266
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,620
dropped down for a quick 15.

267
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,483
Here's the box.

268
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,363
That's what bothers me.

269
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,171
There I am.

270
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:22,010
And here's what bothers me.

271
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,370
If you work out just for the
sake of vanity to and then,

272
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:25,740
and then,

273
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,770
and then when I,

274
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,370
when I see what you're doing is just,

275
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:30,440
you're just sculpting for,

276
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:31,550
for to be a peacock.

277
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,531
I understand.

278
00:06:32,531 --> 00:06:32,661
I,

279
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:33,171
I get,

280
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:35,240
I get staying in shape and
there's something about it.

281
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:37,010
If it's not for something functional,

282
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,170
it was not for something
like that you're doing.

283
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,460
I immediately,

284
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,360
I'm just saying,

285
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,050
you can do it.

286
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:42,883
You're not my friend.

287
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:43,251
That's all.

288
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:44,084
I said.

289
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:46,851
Why is that?

290
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:50,240
What about a guy who's just doing like
bench presses and curls never touches the

291
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:50,721
legs.

292
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:52,430
Just wants to look good in a tight shirt,

293
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,151
but it he's doing it.

294
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:53,800
You know what you know?

295
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,680
You know why I like that?

296
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,831
Well,

297
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,670
I've got no problem with that.

298
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,340
He's doing it so we can go out
and get laid on a Saturday night.

299
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:58,830
Fucking,

300
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,010
Hey God bless you.

301
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,801
What do you think Nancy?

302
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:03,920
What kind of haze doing when he's wearing
leather underwear doing that so he can

303
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:08,840
fucking get the the dailies
and jerk off to himself.

304
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,710
That's why he's fucking doing
it and there's a difference.

305
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,640
I see Matt mcconahey doing a role
like that and Magic Mike all,

306
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:19,670
I'm seeing something masturbatory
I watched Channing Tatum.

307
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,690
He's trying to do something.

308
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:23,450
He's actually playing a character who's
fucking conflicted about being a 30 year

309
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:24,830
old stripper and it's fucking great.

310
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,770
Mcconahey is is.

311
00:07:26,771 --> 00:07:29,000
It's a masturbatory performance.

312
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:30,500
He's watching himself.

313
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:32,090
He's not trying to do anything.

314
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,380
He's not trying to express anything
that's he's trying to play.

315
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,550
I mean the guy has shown a pretty
broad range of gray in the world.

316
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,140
No,

317
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:42,680
Miriam,

318
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,640
I don't want to marry him,

319
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:46,680
but it was really good and
contact the house going on.

320
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,450
He was all right.

321
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,680
He was good in contact.

322
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:49,281
I enjoyed him.

323
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:51,710
I thought he was sensitive without town.

324
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:54,470
Seemed like the type of guy that
would fall in love with Jodie foster.

325
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,670
That was a long time ago.

326
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,450
Um,

327
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,140
who the fuck?

328
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,100
Why didn't you watch that?

329
00:07:58,101 --> 00:07:59,180
I don't know what happened to you.

330
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,680
I was robbed on your head.

331
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:06,590
Is Cal on Mrs Kellen Warner to
watch and he's blaming it on wow.

332
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:06,861
Oh,

333
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,600
I might have to get high and watch it,

334
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:09,980
but I'll probably get really scared.

335
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,510
I'll probably have to get my blankie.

336
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:15,130
You get a little jealous and you better
be inside of a pussy when you watch it

337
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,153
all the time.

338
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,110
I don't have that kind
of stamina or desire of,

339
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,940
I was about sex or will.

340
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,980
That's why you need to give a fuck.

341
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:24,710
I got tricked early on in
life and I figured it out.

342
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:25,520
Now I'm,

343
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,031
I'm fine.

344
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:28,980
Just beaten off and then going
about my business all mine.
