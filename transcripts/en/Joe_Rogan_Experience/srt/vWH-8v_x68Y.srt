1
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,250
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,100
Fuck it. We'll just splice it in
commercials later. Todd glass.

3
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,090
There's no reason to get all crazy.
Oh, there you go. My headphones.

4
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,140
Old School. Old School. That's not
even old school. That's new school.

5
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,210
We were just talking about this
tee shirt that I'm wearing,

6
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:30,840
which is a firm Cap City Comedy Club
in Austin and one of the great American

7
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:33,090
comedy clubs like without a doubt,

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,000
one of the top three four
clubs in the whole country.

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,960
You know we're talking about like places
that have you not hearing yourself a

10
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:44,100
little hard. Oh it's too high.
Too Low. Oh he can to low.

11
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,330
Who is in here that like beautiful.
That's so much work. So hard.

12
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,930
People always say like
when I do UFC broadcast,

13
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:53,790
like why are you fucking
screaming all the time?

14
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:57,360
You were scream on TV and like if
she there, you can't hear anything.

15
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,810
Like people are so loud, like there's
nothing like one of those environments.

16
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:04,650
It's so fucking loud. So when we're
talking before the beginning of the show,

17
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:06,960
I have to talk louder. I can't
even hear what the fuck I'm saying.

18
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,300
You can't even though, you know, it's
hard to imagine. Okay. I know that every,

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,900
I don't know what I'm talking about.
I've got lost already.

20
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,220
But, uh, what I wanted
to talk to you about is,

21
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:20,880
I know that you had a hand in designing
one of the other great comedy clubs in

22
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:24,150
the country. You had a hand in designing
helium, didn't you? I did. And,

23
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,090
and you know what? I give
him a lot of credit. Um,

24
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,270
what's so funny, I just saw that
fake head. Oh, this the aliens.

25
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:35,340
Funny to turn to them dope,
isn't it?

26
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:39,550
I can hold a conversation that cat
is making me a, he's making me, um,

27
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,070
another thing, a Zombie.
That guy's Badass. Oh,

28
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:47,640
by the way. Uh, so I should
say my opinion means anything.

29
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,140
Cause we talked about
it a little off there.

30
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,080
This is why I don't want to
insult the other podcast.

31
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,960
It's not something they care about,
you know, let me look at it that way.

32
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,370
But like this is the coolest studio I've
ever seen. Like you took a lot of time,

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,180
like creatively to make this a cool
space. The brick wall, the red curtains,

34
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:06,900
the black ceiling, the lights with the
like stars in them, the lava lamps,

35
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:09,840
the rocks. It's like, why
fucking nut, right? Yeah. Well,

36
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:12,970
I wanted to do something that would
make me comfortable. Like if the,

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,420
if I don't think it, yeah,
if you have an opera,

38
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,510
I'm very childish and with
what I like, you know, and uh,

39
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,730
like aliens and fucking big foot and
the Werewolf in the front of the place.

40
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,400
I'm very childish, but I
don't, you know, if I'm in a,

41
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:31,050
in an environment that's not like me,
if I'm in a like a clean,

42
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,500
sterile environment, they'll always
be like a little bit of hesitation.

43
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,310
Even if it's a fraction, a little
something that keeps, wants to,

44
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,050
it makes you want to
keep it, you know, PC or,

45
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,900
or not be so honest or whatever.

46
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,520
Office environments I think ultimately
are that they like hypnotized people.

47
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,950
I think just the idea
that you're in an office,

48
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,310
all of a sudden everybody
becomes something that
they're not everybody puts on

49
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:57,390
this bullshit attitude. They
all have this, uh, this,
this weird way of behaving.

50
00:02:57,391 --> 00:03:00,100
No one swears, no one talks
about sex. And then you know,

51
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:01,960
you're not even supposed to
bring up religion or politics.

52
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:05,170
Supposed to like everything's supposed
to be like super fake when you're dealing

53
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:08,380
with customers, super
flat, no personality,

54
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,950
and really ultimately make it look
super predictable for the person you're

55
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:12,700
talking to.

56
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,730
Like you're gonna follow a very strict
pattern of thinking and behaving.

57
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,030
You're a gentleman at Biz in
doing business. Well, uh, yeah.

58
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:22,120
That's why even then when I see
managers offices, like I won't say who,

59
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,300
but like you, this is your way
to express yourself creatively.

60
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,970
Which people then like if I walk into
a manager's office and he gets it

61
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:30,340
creatively and um, I don't
know him that well, I go,

62
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,650
I give them some points for
that. Oh, this guy gets it right.

63
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,140
This manager could have anything he want.
It's not like he,

64
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,830
it looked like hertz and we are
still behind his back. Go, what?

65
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,640
This is what he wanted. Like this is like
if you had to go, ah, fuck it. Look at me.

66
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:46,070
I work at Hertz. Look at my office.
He goes, I want that. Look. Anyway,

67
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,440
that story is available in store. Okay.
I did sort of don't give a fuck though.

68
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:54,400
Right? It's something that they
don't put self analyze myself.

69
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,740
All I'm worried about my,
that story was horrible.

70
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,490
I don't even remember what the story
is. That's where I'm at. I swear to God,

71
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,940
I swear to God that's how much I get lost.
Wow.

72
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,730
And now I'm going to just talk
about wherever I'm at. Dude,

73
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:09,460
we got bookmarks for you. Do you?
Don't worry. You don't have to worry.

74
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,640
We'll always refresh you and let you
know what we're talking about in every

75
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:16,330
conversation. We're ready.
Hi Person Professional.

76
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,490
When it comes to be and
I were excellent at it.

77
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,520
Did you ask me a question that we're
talking about helium? Actually,

78
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:26,050
we were talking about you having a say
in the design because somebody had told

79
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:28,960
me like before I'd ever worked there,
it's like the best club in the country.

80
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:31,570
They were like, this place is perfect.
It's like everything you want to club,

81
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,740
low ceilings. People are packed in tight.
A great neighborhood. It's really cool.

82
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:38,680
Neighborhood is a lot of their bars and
jazz clubs and like there's a lot of

83
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:42,550
funky shit in that area and that
club is just perfectly set up.

84
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,150
And then they told me that you
had a hand in designing it. Yeah,

85
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:49,900
mark called me and he uh, uh, through uh,

86
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,890
Lewis Lee or somebody from
Minneapolis and they said,

87
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:57,340
you're opening up a club and uh, you
know, um, is that the guy from acme?

88
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,800
He's the one. Zach, well,
back to backtrack a little,

89
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:02,380
which I thought was cool that
mark even knew to do. I go,

90
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:04,810
how did you know to call Lewis Lee?
He also called him.

91
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,500
Louis basically taught him how to
run a club. Well Acmes another exam.

92
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:10,810
I've never worked at acme
but I was there recently.

93
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,270
I was hanging out with the arch barker
and he was working there and it's a

94
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:17,230
fucking amazing place. It is. It's
perfect. And all comedians like it.

95
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,770
Mark did the guy who opened up helium,
I'm like, well how'd you know to pick him?

96
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:24,220
Like, how'd you know acne? He goes,
oh, I went to a comedy festival as a,

97
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,180
as a non club owner,

98
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,690
just a guy who thinks he wants to open
up a club and he has every comedian what

99
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:30,940
their favorite club was. He goes, who?
You're attacking me a lot. He goes,

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,510
that sounds like a guide. Want to talk
to? I go, that's so brilliant. He goes,

101
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:37,810
it's just common sense. I go, yeah, but
it's every, most people don't have it.

102
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,350
It's like we were talking about cops the
other day and I love cobb's cobb's in

103
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:44,680
San Francisco. I started at the old
cobb's, which is a really tiny place.

104
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:47,890
It don't mention cops. To me it was
this kid and you know how many people,

105
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:49,240
no matter what you're talking about,
hey,

106
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:53,110
don't mention anybody I can mention around
you and then you have to ask them why

107
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:56,890
and then it becomes about
that. That's really what it
is. Let's guys are annoying.

108
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,770
That's exactly what it is.
They turn it into something about them.

109
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,540
It doesn't have to do with
what you're about to say.

110
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,270
That's to do with their personal trickled.

111
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,070
Did I count it every seat in the room.
He's 180 seats.

112
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,890
She told me 270 sheet
rooms or stealing 10 seats.

113
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,470
Oh God.
Those guys are the worst.

114
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,410
Those guys that are getting
robbed everywhere they go.

115
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,450
And I'm not saying that people haven't
been robbed before. Legitimize.

116
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,590
It's when it happens,
obviously come on every story.

117
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:30,230
These people have so many stories.

118
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:33,110
It's like I've taught class hasn't been
ripped off. Why have you been ripped out?

119
00:06:33,111 --> 00:06:35,930
What the fuck is going on that you keep
getting ripped off by who you mentioned?

120
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,380
Oh, Vinnie APAM squats off.
Well, there's a show for him.

121
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:43,610
There had to be at least a thousand
people. It gives me a check, 80 bucks.

122
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:48,460
Fuck that shit. And there's certain guys
that just have an animosity towards, uh,

123
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,573
club owners.

124
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,650
There's a almost like a natural animosity
because of the fact that like in the

125
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:56,630
beginning, they didn't want to
have anything to do with you.

126
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:59,810
You were real like rejected girl,
you know,

127
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,030
that isn't mature yet. You know, get
real emotional about it and very upset.

128
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,370
And then when the guy comes around,
you're like,

129
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:10,780
where the fuck were you when I was 18
you know, people get crazy. All right.

130
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,660
I think comedians get that way too.
We'll need.

131
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,620
Then in the beginning they're fucking
terrible. So nobody wants to use you.

132
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:20,210
You can't work anywhere and you have
to slowly work your way into a position

133
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:24,020
where someone's actually willing to pay
you to have their customers hear you

134
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:27,290
talk. And that's a really kind
of a special relationship.

135
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,680
And the beginning part is so bad
that we developed this weird sort of

136
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:36,710
contentious relationship
sometimes with club owners.

137
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,520
I think that's like really ridiculous.
You know? I think you're right.

138
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,220
I think you're right. And again,
because I'm overly paranoid,

139
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,270
we're not saying that certain people
haven't legitimately maybe been ripped off

140
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:49,940
shore. And when that happens,
that sucks. What we're saying,

141
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:53,000
like a lot of that animosity comes
from exactly what you just said.

142
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:56,540
It's like you, maybe you were bad.
Then maybe you know, maybe this,

143
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,390
maybe that may be, you know, but
they're not all bad people. Well,

144
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:00,190
a lot of good ones.

145
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:04,940
It took me a while to get the respect
of the people that I came up with in

146
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:06,890
Boston,
like the clubs in Boston.

147
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,000
I was headlining on the road before
I was headlining back in Boston again

148
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:13,490
because they saw me when I was terrible.
I mean,

149
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,270
they saw me as an open mic or I should
never been allowed to go on stage.

150
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,071
So when,

151
00:08:18,071 --> 00:08:22,940
so when you seen someone just fucking
stink it up hardcore for like, you know,

152
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:25,880
a year or two in the beginning
of their career, it's just,

153
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,280
it just makes sense that you
wouldn't want and you're like,

154
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:30,650
five years later you're like,
Chrissy, man, I'm not buying it.

155
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,990
This guy's gotta be still terrible.
You know,

156
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:36,500
I saw him when he was an open miker and
every comedian sorta says that they have

157
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:40,790
to like leave your town and get success
elsewhere and then they respect it and

158
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,810
recognize it. But if they see
you when you suck in their mind,

159
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,970
you suck. Like Pete, it's
really hard for people to adapt.

160
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,050
It's works that way with athletics
too, with fighting. It works that way.

161
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:53,450
And these guys that believe
that this guy can't beat them.

162
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:56,010
There's no way that guy could be
me. My like, I just you like, it's

163
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,600
craziness.
It's a crazy way of thinking.

164
00:08:57,601 --> 00:09:02,340
But they know back when the guys sucked
and they refuse to admit that people can

165
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,620
figure things out that people can improve.

166
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,850
Yeah. I even have that
happen, but I try not to like,

167
00:09:09,851 --> 00:09:11,920
I'll think I'll think of somebody
the way I thought about them.

168
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,830
You know somebody, there's a
comedian wanted to, Oh, a Jew,

169
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:19,140
a middle in Philadelphia and
I, and I really think of,
well, you're probably like,

170
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,400
oh wait, I haven't seen him in a while.
And then I take the time, I'm like,

171
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,760
oh my God, I just got stuck in this
mindset, but at least I got out of it.

172
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:29,070
I love the comedian that it's about,
don't fucking find it. If it's not useful.

173
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:34,570
You know what you but don't be so sure
you might, okay. I'm very sorry it's you,

174
00:09:34,571 --> 00:09:37,780
but don't be so sure there's somebody
on that has to be me. I'm from Philly.

175
00:09:37,781 --> 00:09:41,500
I worked with Todd and Philly. Wasn't
he? Just say my name. Give me a plug.

176
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:45,370
People are too damn sensitive about
a people's assessments of them.

177
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,230
As long as those assessments are polite,

178
00:09:47,231 --> 00:09:50,200
you shouldn't take it to
fucking personally. You can
learn from those things.

179
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,090
Yeah. I had a comedian
once. You know what?

180
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,180
I'm glad that I just luckily
wasn't stupid because he goes,

181
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,590
I could have easily been offended,
but early in my career, he goes, well,

182
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:03,100
hung out during the day and then he goes,
he said this affectionately,

183
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:08,020
I remember it. I was like 23 maybe 24 he
goes, he goes, you're funny hanging out.

184
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:10,480
He goes, what are you doing
up there on stage? You know?

185
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:15,610
Like I knew he was fucking right
and he knew I could handle it.

186
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,250
You know? He said something, he goes,
that's what you want to be doing. But I,

187
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,430
but I remember thinking I could have
easily been like fucked up. Right.

188
00:10:20,431 --> 00:10:21,071
That's my story.

189
00:10:21,071 --> 00:10:24,630
You know what my story could have been
then this fucking idiot tells me I'm fun

190
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,320
me offstage, but I'm not. Fuck you.

191
00:10:26,321 --> 00:10:29,260
I was doing better than you every night
when she might've been because he was

192
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:34,150
bad, but whatever. He was honest with
me. And, um, instead the story is,

193
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,580
thank you,
I appreciate it.

194
00:10:36,581 --> 00:10:39,580
He said that it made me
consciously tried to change that

195
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,170
there was a guy that said something
to me when we were both starting out

196
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:47,820
together. We had been both doing
it about six months and, uh,

197
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,450
I was still like,
I still had my foot in another world.

198
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:54,540
I was still teaching martial
arts since I was still competing.

199
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,790
And I was really confused. And
he said to me, goes, you know,

200
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,950
he was being a Dick, totally
being a dick. He goes,

201
00:11:01,951 --> 00:11:04,770
you started off pretty funny man,
but you, uh, you lost promise.

202
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:09,090
He seemed to be repeating yourself
and it's just like you, uh, I dunno.

203
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,970
It seems like you've lost
momentum. And I was like, wow.

204
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,580
And I didn't argue with them. That
was the weird part. I didn't like,

205
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:17,580
fuck you bitch. You know, there
was none of that. I just went, wow,

206
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,540
I got to agree with you. Like I'm
not really paying attention a comic.

207
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,410
And Open Miker that I worked with
that you know, we would, you know,

208
00:11:24,411 --> 00:11:27,200
we were all like sort of competitive
young guys and going to these school,

209
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,990
I try to be, I have some camaraderie, but
there was always a glad we were young,

210
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:33,000
we were retarded, we didn't know
how to communicate with each other.

211
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,420
We didn't know how to be honest and
express ourselves and we were insecure as

212
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:39,210
fuck. We're trying to be a standup
Comedians, most insecure world,

213
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,650
probably in show business.

214
00:11:40,651 --> 00:11:44,490
He created all yourself and he said
something that was totally true and I

215
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:47,340
remember it. It's tall,
it's stung for sure,

216
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,900
but it made me make a clear decision to,

217
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:55,300
to just abandon the other, to
[inaudible] to completely remove myself,

218
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:57,760
quit my job, just get, get jobs,

219
00:11:57,761 --> 00:12:00,460
like paying for things just
because that's what one thing is.

220
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:03,370
One Guy said that it helped me a lot.

221
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,210
Like I could say like he was being a
dick when he was doing it and I'm sure he

222
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:08,860
was,
I'm sure he's trying to hurt my feelings,

223
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,570
but he was right and because he was right,
it was really beneficial.

224
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,480
It was really important and
it was really important,

225
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,840
like for me as a comedian to mate,
first of all,

226
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:22,660
to be aware that that this
has to apply this way.

227
00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:25,540
Although it's like very difficult to do,
especially emotionally,

228
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,220
it's very difficult to accept criticism.

229
00:12:27,221 --> 00:12:29,800
It's very difficult to see people
see yourself as other people see you,

230
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,700
but it's so fucking important. If you
can't do that, like you're, you're gonna,

231
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:35,320
you're gonna never continue to grow.

232
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,720
You're going to hit a
rough spot and then boom,

233
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:39,580
you're going to tail
spin and then that's it.

234
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,830
Yeah. You see that a lot. Fuck
yeah, you do. It's funny people too.

235
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:47,550
That's what's a shame. Like it's not
funny, but they get caught in this,

236
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,220
something goes wrong. Yeah. Or
like, and like we said before,

237
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,330
the ones that I remember, comedians
that had fucked this business attitudes.

238
00:12:54,331 --> 00:12:55,164
I'm not kidding.

239
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,870
Like now of course then it seemed like
they had been doing comedy a long time,

240
00:12:57,871 --> 00:13:02,610
but like eight years into the business,
right. Fuck this. Fuck this business.

241
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,640
We're two years in. I remember it
comedian having a joke, like, hey, here.

242
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,650
Really? That's so silly that
man. Well, it's the same thing.

243
00:13:09,651 --> 00:13:13,730
It's like a rejected boy or a rejected
girl. Rejected young person, I should say.

244
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,720
It doesn't have emotional maturity and
they get angry. That's really what it is.

245
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,220
Like that rejection sometimes is the best
fucking thing that can ever happen to

246
00:13:22,221 --> 00:13:26,900
you. Like it might feel like shit, but
you'll figure that out because of it.

247
00:13:26,901 --> 00:13:29,480
You're either going to quit,
are you going to figure it out?

248
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,610
You're going to have a new inspiration

249
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,730
suit so that you know what? Um,
I would never want to own a club.

250
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,340
When I complain about club owners,
I've realized I'm not changing this.

251
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,810
Does it seem like I'm changing
the subject? Not at all.
Not at all. You're right.

252
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,743
I'm going.

253
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,750
I know exactly what you got because I
do make fun of the bad clubs and I do.

254
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:52,780
I spend a lot of time making fun of the
bag clubs and they should be made fun of.

255
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:56,560
Some of them have fucking,
they're horrible, but I
also defend the good clubs.

256
00:13:56,561 --> 00:13:58,270
I wouldn't want to own a good club.
You know why?

257
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:03,850
Imagine all the fucking whack a doodle
comedians fucking bothering them and

258
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:08,950
getting mad at them unnecessarily. Like,
you know, not all of them. I wasn't.

259
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,040
I was, I remember thank
God and I did a lot wrong,

260
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:17,060
but I always knew that like I, I forgot,
I completely forgot what I was talking.

261
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:21,710
We're talking about clubs and like getting
along with clubs and I never got mad

262
00:14:21,711 --> 00:14:24,580
at club owners over the years
when a club wouldn't use me.

263
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:28,180
You know what all at all I liked
is when they told this story,

264
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:32,020
and I can think of a specific club that
said this. I wasn't what they wanted,

265
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,830
but they said, you know,
he was nice and he,

266
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:38,050
the staff liked them because
it's just not my thing.

267
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,110
But he tried to point out that I
was at decent guy and you know what?

268
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,340
I accepted it. I was like,
I remember someone was like,
fuck him. I go, no, no, no.

269
00:14:45,341 --> 00:14:47,500
He has a right,
he can't love every comedian,

270
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:50,560
but at least he told that's not
the story I could have told.

271
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:52,010
I could have been like,
oh yeah, I could have

272
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,050
been that same story could have been
even though the guy did it right and he

273
00:14:55,051 --> 00:14:57,920
tried to, I could have been like, fuck
him. You know what he tells my manager,

274
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,020
the staff flight to the Fox that
supposed to mean, you know what I mean?

275
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:06,660
Like flipping it around negative.
Totally. Yeah. So it was so,

276
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,410
and there was a few clubs over the years
that wouldn't hire me and guess what?

277
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:13,650
Some Jew now and uh, I, you know,

278
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,270
I didn't want to be that person. I'll fuck
that club. They will now. They want you.

279
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:21,620
So what do you want to teach
them a lesson? Love the fact
that they exist. I mean,

280
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:25,130
one of the best things about being a
comedian is the ability to work in clubs.

281
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,750
I do some larger spots now and I,
but I still do like the ice house.

282
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:33,290
Like I deal with the Ice House on a lot
of Wednesday nights and it's only like

283
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,770
150 people or 190 people or something
like that. It's fucking amazing.

284
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:40,400
It's a magical room. I mean
it's, it's magical. It's tight.

285
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:45,910
The ice house is dark and it's got 50
fucking years of laughs burned into it,

286
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,800
you know, I mean that's
legit. That place. If, uh,

287
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,860
an area or a space can encode a memory,

288
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,890
can somehow or another capture a memory.
Like if you go to,

289
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,100
my dad went to Gettysburg and he
said when he was there, he felt sad.

290
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,010
He said it really was a overwhelming
feeling of sadness. He goes,

291
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:02,450
it was really hard to describe.

292
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,590
He's not an airy fairy sort
of a woo woo kind of a guy.

293
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,270
And when he said that about Gettysburg,

294
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:11,300
he's an architect and I said that
about Gettysburg. He was like,

295
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,170
he was just something about
it. It just didn't, just,
you could feel it in the air.

296
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,970
I really believe that. I believe a club
like the laugh stop in, uh, in Houston.

297
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,050
Did you ever work at that? Stop that
place, that place you walked in,

298
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:28,700
you said you felt it in your fingers.
You're like, Whoa, this place is on fire.

299
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,690
Mark Babbitt is the reason that club used
to have a great reputation. And I love,

300
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,960
let me tell you something I don't wish
anybody ill on. I don't wish anybody ever,

301
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,600
I don't care what they do.
I do not wish anybody ill.

302
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:43,280
But I do wish that your
empire would fall apart.

303
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,010
It doesn't mean anyone would be
sick or homeless or, but you're,

304
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:48,500
I do wish your empire would fall apart.

305
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,650
Like it did not realizing Mark
Babbitt was why you had it.

306
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,410
They never knew that he
was the soul of that place.

307
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,860
So when he left it went down hill
and they have no idea to this day,

308
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,770
do you think they have the intelligence
to go, hey, what happened there?

309
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,650
We made a huge mistake. We had a
manager who fucking basically gave them,

310
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,180
you know, we didn't know how
important he was. We fired them.

311
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:10,310
And the business slowly closed.
No,

312
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:14,180
they're just telling some other's
bullshit story. Was there a matter of,

313
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,250
I don't know,
there was some sort of a legal matter.

314
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:19,880
I don't want to mention what might or
might not have happened because honestly

315
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:20,810
I've just rumors.

316
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:24,650
I guess what I heard from fucking
Ralphie minor knew it that fuck I totally

317
00:17:24,651 --> 00:17:27,800
turned on him. He was a, you know,

318
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,850
a guy who really loved comedy and
that's a historic fucking club.

319
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,970
Maybe Bill Hicks recorded, didn't Bill
Hicks one of his standup specials there?

320
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,990
Saint Man, I think, I'm not
sure, but I know that um,

321
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,870
one of his early special said sure. But
I wasn't positive. I think it was there.

322
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:46,010
Um, and that's, that used to be where
the, the, the annex was, you know,

323
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:50,070
we're s Kinison started out and Hick
started out like you would walk into that

324
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,770
last stop in river oaks.
There was two laptops.

325
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,840
It was the one and then they moved it.
When they moved it,

326
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:57,780
that's when things started getting
squirrelly. But the original one,

327
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,340
you would walk into that place and you
would feel the fucking energy that has

328
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:04,320
been pumped out into that room.

329
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:09,060
Like these people have like years
and years, a fucking hysterical

330
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:13,020
gold laughter. Like impregnates the
walls. You want to hear new place.

331
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:15,780
Didn't have that. Do you want to
hear what you're talking about?

332
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:19,890
But someone took advantage of this and
works at for them when they sell homes,

333
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:22,070
I swear to God, this is
what a girl told me. It'll,

334
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,600
it goes back to exactly what
we're talking about. She goes,

335
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:26,430
you want to know my line?
I say, when I'm selling,

336
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:30,200
someone's selling some of the house.
She goes, I say of House has sold this.

337
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,020
I don't you feel like this has a good one.
And she goes, most people like, oh yeah.

338
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:37,080
Especially if they liked the house,
but she's full of shit. She's lying.

339
00:18:37,081 --> 00:18:38,780
She's just saying that.
But every half else,

340
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,580
that's such a good line that people go,
yeah, I it does have a good soul and, but,

341
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:48,260
but she's working on something that
does exist as we're talking about.

342
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:51,780
Cause I agree. There's no way those
laughters it's not just in our head,

343
00:18:51,781 --> 00:18:56,400
that's something there, that's some
energy when a room has had that much,

344
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,350
you know, not out that much
soul. You know, I don't,

345
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,550
I mean it sounds like horse
shit. Makes Sense. Sure.

346
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:06,360
Uh, any reasonable scientist would
tell us it's horse shit. Oh really?

347
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,770
But maybe,

348
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:12,270
maybe it does for us symbolically because
you know what that like when I walk

349
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:15,000
into the punchline,
Atlanta de Jesus Christ,

350
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:18,990
I mean that place has been around forever.
It's a fucking masterfully bill club.

351
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,850
Another one perfect comedy club.

352
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,300
And you see those pictures of the wall
like Richard Jenny when he was like 30,

353
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,560
you're like, wow, like look at these
fucking headshots. So like all these old,

354
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:32,830
old headshots, xannies and Nashville.
You ever do that place? I love,

355
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,170
all you can do is look at those pictures
every night and find something new to

356
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,580
the figure out. That time
I never get tired. I read,
look at them. I look at them.

357
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,340
Any of those clubs, I know that there's
a breed club you're talking about.

358
00:19:44,341 --> 00:19:46,570
It's not a helium because they
don't haven't been open as right,

359
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,720
but it's those 35 year olds, 35 year
old clubs or clubs, those walls.

360
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,950
Holy Shit. I remember the person
I thought I look up at the wall.

361
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,040
Anybody that had a gimmick, I thought
they were going to be really successful.

362
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,730
Like one guy who was called the coach and
had a whistle and I was thinking I was

363
00:20:02,731 --> 00:20:06,540
like 19 I'll be like fuck, I wish I would
have thought I was always so jealous.

364
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,770
Yeah, I get it. Blows the whistle and
I'm the coach got damn it. That's it.

365
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,790
I was always so jealous of those and
then they tend not to be doing comedy.

366
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,330
You know what I was really jealous of of

367
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,320
the dudes who had like the, the big
full page ads in that comedy guide.

368
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:26,080
Do you remember the comedy guide? I
sorta do. The comedy guide was this,

369
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,330
it was an industry comedy guy that
would come out like every year,

370
00:20:29,331 --> 00:20:33,620
like all the managers would
have it and they would, these,

371
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,680
these comedians would take out these giant
full page ads and show like what Naca

372
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:42,230
Conference, you know they perform dad
and performing at colleges lot and they,

373
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,710
they had like this really professionally
done photography and shit.

374
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,010
Like that was how comedians got the

375
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,810
word out about it and that's
how they marketed these stuff.

376
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:54,811
To buy time in the industry guide and
then put together some VHS tape and send

377
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:59,290
it out the cards. Did you ever have
a comedy card? No, never had it.

378
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:04,410
We had a card once to promote a website
that I put out to promote my website,

379
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:08,590
but there was never one
for like, like, you know,

380
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:13,620
I'm appearing in this town like with like
pointing to the right and the big some

381
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:20,140
someone told me, what am I coming
to you? Someone told me that uh, um,

382
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,800
my track record is this and then I'll
tell you what somebody told me George

383
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,080
Carlin said, but at least I wish I
could've said I never had a card.

384
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,710
But I am proud to say if
I'm going to be 100% honest,

385
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:32,410
I had one for like a month and then
I just didn't like the smell of it.

386
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:37,030
So he got rid of it. I know. Yeah. I was
like, no tog glass comedian, I was like,

387
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:40,300
Oh shit. I think I saw some other
comedian with a car and I'm like,

388
00:21:40,301 --> 00:21:42,790
I should have cards, you know?
And then I got rid of him.

389
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,290
So now I'm glad because
someone said somebody at the,

390
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,900
George Carlin was talking about cards
backstage at the comedy magic club and

391
00:21:49,901 --> 00:21:51,830
basically said, he goes, God, you know,

392
00:21:51,831 --> 00:21:54,190
and the community doesn't
have a fucking card, you know.

393
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,760
And then the comedian that had the card
sort of felt like he took them very

394
00:21:57,761 --> 00:22:02,510
quickly over to the trash because
he had just gotten cards. Yeah.

395
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,740
That was a thing about
headshots back in Boston.

396
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,260
Anybody who's any good
had the shitty headshot,

397
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,530
they didn't give a fuck about
their headshots. Right, right.

398
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:14,140
And you can see that same,
that same path.

399
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,540
And they would talk about it like if you
hire a photographer to do your headshot,

400
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,830
you fucking suck on stage.
That was like,

401
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:25,540
those are just such an unspoken
are their exception. Yes. But no,

402
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,520
mostly that's such a great,

403
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,660
well there's something that makes you
want to take a picture of yourself and be

404
00:22:31,661 --> 00:22:32,540
all sexy looking.

405
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:37,240
That's Uber Douchey and it
doesn't translate into comedy.

406
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,210
You know,
there's some guys who could ham it up.

407
00:22:40,211 --> 00:22:43,810
Like I remember Kevin Knox had
like are really zany like Ted shot,

408
00:22:43,811 --> 00:22:48,670
but it worked for him cause that was
like his act like he was a wild energetic

409
00:22:48,671 --> 00:22:52,180
guy. What if I talk about how
bad that is and I agree with you,

410
00:22:52,181 --> 00:22:56,330
but then you guys pull in line a picture
of me with my shoe is a phone. Todd,

411
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:00,150
we found this picture of you like, Oh
that with the shoe. Yeah. It was like,

412
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,860
it was a fun, nobody did that
then. No, I was really the first.

413
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:07,090
You know what my favorite is guys who do
characters and they have like multiple

414
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:10,570
characters on their head shots.
Like this is the hillbilly.

415
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,070
This is doctor.
Does anybody still do that?

416
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,090
No Man. I don't know.
Someone was on the podcast,

417
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:23,800
I don't know who to credit for this,
but they were talking about how um, uh,

418
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,881
you guys would know,

419
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:29,680
you guys remember about how the
genre of prop comedy's gone.

420
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,640
Carrot top room moved it.
You can't be a prop guy anymore.

421
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,850
But when we were starting out, that
was an option. It was like prop guys.

422
00:23:36,851 --> 00:23:41,290
There was, you know, regular
standup comics. There was
dirty guys, it was prop guys.

423
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,740
The prop guy doesn't exist anymore.
You never see the prop guy anymore.

424
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,250
Carrot top essentially just

425
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,360
dominated the market so thoroughly that
everybody else abandoned it. Let me,

426
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,580
let me say this,
if somebody out there was willing,

427
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:56,840
this is a real offer to like let's say
they had money and they think it's a good

428
00:23:56,841 --> 00:24:00,290
idea and then I could give them,
I will give them 40% of all my income.

429
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:04,890
If somebody goes, I will pay for it.
Todd, we build him a great property,

430
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,980
like we hire writers and it's the,
it's like an anti prop act.

431
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,430
I would go tour with it if somebody
was willing to put money into it,

432
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:15,440
like producing go, you were going
to hire, we're going to build this.

433
00:24:15,441 --> 00:24:17,860
It's going to be a truck.
It's going to go and you're going to do a,

434
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,440
but we're going to put money into it.
Somebody out there, promoter have creator,

435
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,470
half promoter. Thanks. I'd fucking
do that. You would ask 40% per,

436
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,590
I want to put it down on record,
but we will talk about the fee.

437
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:32,030
You would actually be the perfect guy
to put together like a fake prop act,

438
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:36,390
like a prop act as that you have like,
but no disrespect,

439
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:40,190
disrespect to it.
It would be just like the opposite of it.

440
00:24:40,191 --> 00:24:42,560
Like there'd be like these weird like,
I don't know,

441
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,720
he would just make it shitty
the way you know, like you,

442
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:46,430
if you're going to make fun of a comedian,

443
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,910
you tell a bunch of shitty jokes
and the punchline, now it's,

444
00:24:49,911 --> 00:24:53,290
you're not disrespecting
comedy, shitty comedy. Right?

445
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,510
So that was what you would do. You'd be
disrespecting a shitty prop back. Yes.

446
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,680
And it would be just almost a mock of
a project that didn't put a lot of time

447
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:03,330
into his props. Like, no,
he's just like tape. You know?

448
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,290
He's like pulling things out that are
obviously, and they're not even, he goes,

449
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:08,240
it used to be taped together.
He shows the crowd.

450
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:11,030
It was a few guys that
were like combination.

451
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,790
They would like have a few
props and they would do comics.

452
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:17,540
Do you remember Dennis?
Melanie. Lenny Shoultz.

453
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,380
Do you remember crazy? Lenny?
Jesus Christ. He would,

454
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:24,260
he would pick up a fucking
smokey the bear. Okay.

455
00:25:24,261 --> 00:25:28,610
He had a smokey the bear doll and he
would only, you can prevent forest fires.

456
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:31,730
Then he'd go fuck you and
punched the bear. And that

457
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,190
was so ridiculous. It would knock
the bear like through the crowd.

458
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:42,200
Like fuck you.
This is completely silly.

459
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:45,080
Duncan Trussell in it. Does a prop
back are used to with little Hobo.

460
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,410
Well it's hacky. That's a little different
though. That there's another level.

461
00:25:48,411 --> 00:25:52,620
That's the other level. That's the, the,
the puppet master guy. The puppet is a,

462
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,570
another video camera. That kind of, Jeff
Dunham is pretty much dominated now.

463
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:00,770
I mean there's still a few
other guys. Like there's the,
uh, the guy a faith tour.

464
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,020
What's his name? Fader. Terry
Fator. Terry Fator. Oh yeah,

465
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:08,030
a big one in Vegas as well.
Um, and, but that's, you know,

466
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,980
there's not like many young guns out
there with a fucking taking a doll to a

467
00:26:11,981 --> 00:26:12,814
coffee club

468
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:17,290
and he's got a lot of guys
that are rocking that Ad.

469
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,060
I think so. You know the visual
of the hand just instantly.

470
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,990
I just picture the comedy club. I was
just out a week ago. What are the odds?

471
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:29,000
Like I would walk up on stage seriously

472
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,950
and you put your hand up and made the
fake puppets. Well, the best of all time,

473
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:39,860
best of all time in my opinion is auto
and George the best of all time I worked

474
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:44,070
with Datto. We did a gang of gigs in a
danger fields in New York. We did prom

475
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:48,740
shows, which are helacious. Have you ever
done the prom show? Oh I've, I've done a,

476
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,051
yeah,

477
00:26:49,051 --> 00:26:52,480
one or two when they have them in New
York City where they just keep funneling

478
00:26:52,481 --> 00:26:53,550
the people into the club.

479
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:57,850
They get these kids from high schools
and they bring them in and they,

480
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,070
they don't end the show.

481
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:03,870
They tell you to do new material
every time and they, they are,

482
00:27:03,871 --> 00:27:05,250
they tell you not to do new material,

483
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:08,910
that to tell you the same material every
time so that they would realize that

484
00:27:08,911 --> 00:27:11,400
the show was over because they
never cleaned the place out.

485
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,560
They just kept packing kids in there,
uh,

486
00:27:13,561 --> 00:27:16,260
violating every fire code
in existence and would,

487
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,690
and it would go on til five
o'clock in the morning. I mean,

488
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:21,840
you would start working at eight at
night and you would do shows until five

489
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:24,060
o'clock in the morning.
They would just keep rotating the lineup.

490
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:27,090
I would leave and it would be light out.
It was madness.

491
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,620
But for like a young comic,

492
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,800
it's a pretty good cause it's like 75
bucks a sat or something like that and

493
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:34,300
you're packing all those sets
together. So it was, it was, uh,

494
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,140
a good chunk of money for,
for Canadians.

495
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,710
So a lot of us did it and odd when I did
band and we did a I a couple of clubs,

496
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,530
I'd never got to work with him that much.

497
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:47,550
I only get to see him like three times
live. I remember just punching, you know,

498
00:27:47,551 --> 00:27:51,990
it's nice when you go to see someone
like that and the people around you are

499
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,620
enjoying as much as you do, like a ton
of people in really fucking enjoy him.

500
00:27:55,621 --> 00:27:58,470
And then I feel like there's like
people like me that go, it's fucking,

501
00:27:58,471 --> 00:28:02,100
I can't handle it. I want to be around
those people and I wouldn't wear,

502
00:28:02,101 --> 00:28:05,610
the last time I saw him, the couple
next to me, husband and wife,

503
00:28:05,611 --> 00:28:06,890
I found that they were w I,

504
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,690
we just started punching each other and
we're glad we had someone, the punch,

505
00:28:09,691 --> 00:28:12,150
you know, and the people ahead of
us. We're sort of the same way.

506
00:28:12,151 --> 00:28:15,270
Everyone else was loving it, but we
were definitely going, I'm going to die.

507
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,520
You know, it was just so, it is what it
comedy festival. And he was saying health,

508
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:23,790
desperate, older comedians. And
then he went, I give to understand.

509
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:27,260
I felt like I never saw them my
whole life when he, when he goes, um,

510
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:31,590
like something happens.
And then de jure,

511
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:35,660
I get it mixed up right now I'm talking
about, oh, and George auto would say, uh,

512
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,060
he'd say as a woman in the crowd,
like, hey, how are you? And He,

513
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,110
the puppet would mock him.

514
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,970
It's crowd work was holy Shit.
Are you shitting me?

515
00:28:43,971 --> 00:28:48,850
That's what you find in a Lillian. He
has stopped to chauffeur. Hey, hello. Oh,

516
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,610
he goes up. Then it would like to see
a puppet really dig into a human being.

517
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:55,880
I had never seen that,
and for me that was fucking unbelievable.

518
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,610
He used to have a fucking
thing he was working on.

519
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:02,630
It was Kennedy getting shot in the head
and saw the puppet's head would flip

520
00:29:02,631 --> 00:29:04,790
back like a flop up of scalp,

521
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,360
which he goes and I want to figure
out how to put a brain in there.

522
00:29:08,361 --> 00:29:10,940
Maybe square blood out of it.
That's hilarious.

523
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:18,140
He was so funny and people will get mad.
They would go, I see your lips moving.

524
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,400
He didn't try to hide that.
His lips are moving like,

525
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:27,470
what is he not understanding what
he's doing? I see. Guess what?

526
00:29:27,471 --> 00:29:31,520
That has to be certifiably. No, no, no,
no bullshit. A problem with the mental,

527
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:35,270
the mental disability. It's a fucking
puppet. Of course, his lips are moving.

528
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,100
Just pay attention to what he's doing,

529
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:41,410
but that's someone there that was taking
it for face value. Oh Wow. How was he?

530
00:29:41,411 --> 00:29:45,160
Well, I didn't hard to get past the
blips. You know, I saw his lips moving.

531
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:49,970
So George,
obviously he's still doing club dates.

532
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:54,250
Yeah, he's a maniac, but
he's just so crazy. I know.

533
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:59,170
So He's, he's fucking hilarious. What
was that picture of me? You're in a prop.

534
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,780
What was it? You and a
bag. Oh, did somebody make,

535
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,370
did I used to do props? No, I
don't think I did that ever.

536
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:12,430
I do that or did they Photoshop? It looks
like it was like a red carpet event.

537
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:16,450
You from the American beauty or
something like that. Oh, Jesus.

538
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:21,190
I wonder if,
I wonder if there's hope for,

539
00:30:21,191 --> 00:30:24,730
for the, uh, what, what would they
call him? Puppet acts. What's the,

540
00:30:24,731 --> 00:30:29,620
somebody will have to do it. Great.
Ventriloquist. Yeah. The wonder. Yeah.

541
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:33,010
I mean it feels, I feel like that's a
genre that can be fucked with, you know,

542
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:37,150
Dunkin did it, but he only did it for
like this one bit, which is hilarious.

543
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,650
Beautiful.
A Little Hobo.

544
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:43,630
Little Hobos is evil puppet and killed
his grandfather and he does this one bit.

545
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:48,460
It's fucking genius, but it's not a lot
of like young guys. And he'd go to a club.

546
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:52,080
It's very rare that you see
a young guy that's a puppet
act. Yeah. Yeah. You don't,

547
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,050
is there anything else? We're not
thinking of a willy, Tyler and Lester.

548
00:30:56,051 --> 00:30:57,850
He was another famous ones. Yeah. No,

549
00:30:57,851 --> 00:31:01,300
I mean that you don't think of another
type of comedy. Yeah. Oh, oh. Any style.

550
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:05,260
When I think of someone doing it,
I think if somebody has may be mocking it.

551
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:09,190
That's what, but what about not mocking
it? Could somebody come back and make it?

552
00:31:09,191 --> 00:31:11,170
It was just that good and they,
right.

553
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:13,630
Why can't it be good banter
between the puppet and the person?

554
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,900
Certainly the book it is with Auto,
right? That's what I'm saying. But we're,

555
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,480
we're excluding him guys.

556
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,920
He's got some jokes where he goes back
and forth with the puppets that are

557
00:31:23,921 --> 00:31:27,280
pretty fucking funny. We'll know then.
Then that to me is always amazing.

558
00:31:27,281 --> 00:31:29,980
But I know that the, the
cliche stuff, it's like,

559
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,480
I think Jeff Dunham does it like
more of like family friendly.

560
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,350
Like he tries intentionally to sort
of, uh, is there a good psychic,

561
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:43,300
does that exist? Well, I
mean like comedian psychics,

562
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:46,420
I've never even heard of one.
I've heard of a comedy hypnotists.

563
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:50,470
Juva juvenile never. Oh, you have an
opinion on that. They'll way it works.

564
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:54,130
It definitely works. Yeah. Comedy
hypnotism is 100% real. Okay.

565
00:31:54,131 --> 00:31:57,880
Here's why I'm sort of, not that you're
the all knowing, but you know, I usually,

566
00:31:57,881 --> 00:32:00,490
you probably broke it down
without even getting into detail.

567
00:32:00,491 --> 00:32:01,870
You probably shred it the fuck out of it.

568
00:32:01,871 --> 00:32:04,180
And so I think you probably
know the right answer.

569
00:32:04,181 --> 00:32:07,990
So I'm glad because here's what my problem
with is. If it was fake and I thought,

570
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,130
no, I can't explain it, but here's what I
used to say. I can't explain it. I don't.

571
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,470
But here's the one thing.
If it's fake,

572
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:18,790
how come never do those
audience members on stage break?

573
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,560
Never. Never. Now. So are they in
some hip? What's happening here?

574
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:27,250
You can tell they can tell a good
guy whether someone's under not.

575
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,410
And some people you just can't hypnotize.

576
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:33,820
I think there's really some people that
have brains that are easier to hack.

577
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:35,830
I agree.
I think you could just get into him.

578
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:40,280
I'll tell you this for a fact because
I worked with a named Frank Santos,

579
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,750
the r rated hypnotist. I worked
with him many, many, many, many,

580
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:45,770
many times.

581
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:50,950
Back in the Boston days when I was an
open miker and I was 100% skeptical,

582
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:54,060
the first time I saw it I was like,
this is bullshit. These people,

583
00:32:54,061 --> 00:32:54,894
I'll just faking it,

584
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:58,340
but then when you watch a guy actually
come in his pants and you watch people do

585
00:32:58,341 --> 00:33:01,640
things that he's telling them to do,
then you realize, oh, wait a minute.

586
00:33:01,641 --> 00:33:05,570
I'm a control freak. It would never
work on me, but it works on some people.

587
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,120
Some people, especially
in the, in that context,

588
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:11,720
it actually might work better because
they're nervous and they get on stage and

589
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:14,960
there's a bright light and this guy just
knows how to lock you in and tell you

590
00:33:14,961 --> 00:33:16,550
what to do, tell you what to
do. You're going to breathe,

591
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:19,130
you're going to breathe in on the
count of five, you're going to just go,

592
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,360
you're going to go to sleep, relax all
the muscles in your body. One, two, three,

593
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,830
four,
five.

594
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:28,100
And he would touch these guys and they
would fucking collaterally for me.

595
00:33:28,101 --> 00:33:31,940
I could just feel that. I swear to
God. No, I mean it just let it in.

596
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:35,270
Three seconds just to go. Someone is
counting down and let your shoulders down.

597
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:40,100
But he was a real hypnotist first and
then he got into comedy hypnotist.

598
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,280
Let me ask you this, and someone that
knows a lot about this might even say,

599
00:33:43,281 --> 00:33:47,480
well no Todd, that's not hypnotism, but
what? Even if it's this, because look,

600
00:33:47,481 --> 00:33:49,970
they get laughs and the
average person to get laughs,

601
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,270
it's how's it feel to get laughs?
It feels unfucking believable.

602
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,070
So let's say even if a Naysayer said, I,
ed tries to answer the question this way,

603
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,250
I still might not negate to hypnotism,
but what if a Naysayer said,

604
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,740
now they're just getting lamps.
And when people get those type of lifts,

605
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:06,020
they get comfortable.
So they get,

606
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:08,840
they let their guard them because
everything they do is getting a laugh.

607
00:34:08,841 --> 00:34:10,400
They're getting a laugh cause
there's a professional up.

608
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:11,330
They're making it happen.

609
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,180
So maybe they get more
comfortable and more comfortable.

610
00:34:14,181 --> 00:34:17,570
So the more weirdness is thrown at them,
they're getting the laugh. It feels good.

611
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,120
And they go to the,
you're still take him somewhere.

612
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,820
So if you're doing it
through laughter there,

613
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:26,000
you're taking them somewhere to do some
shit that they're not doing in their

614
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:29,900
normal lives. Yeah, I don't, I
don't know what the conscious,

615
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,830
like the interpretation of the person
who's actually doing it to some of them

616
00:34:33,831 --> 00:34:36,860
see what they're doing to other ones.
See something that's not even there.

617
00:34:36,861 --> 00:34:41,480
I don't, I don't understand that
because one of them he did, he said, uh,

618
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:45,020
he was, he had a weird way of talking
about a very strange accent and he'd say,

619
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:49,250
you about to make love to Madonna.
Madonna is on the ground. She's naked.

620
00:34:49,251 --> 00:34:51,220
You're on top of a,
you're going to make love to Madonna.

621
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:54,500
And this guy starts fucking,
I mean, he starts fucking,

622
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:58,310
and the crowds is,
is it stitches?

623
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:02,810
Stitches Comedy Club in Boston. This
is the stitches to the second stitches.

624
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,850
There's one that was
attached to the paradise.

625
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,820
It was this old school place that's the
first place that ever performed an open

626
00:35:07,821 --> 00:35:11,510
mic night at that place went under and
then they opened up a new place and this

627
00:35:11,511 --> 00:35:14,420
was at the new place. He,
the guy came in his pants.

628
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,070
I saw the guy come in his pants like,
I mean, I ain't go go look at them.

629
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,330
But I mean it was pretty obvious that
the guy came in his pants and he was

630
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:27,230
embarrassed and everyone was laughing and
he didn't know what the fuck they were

631
00:35:27,231 --> 00:35:29,390
laughing at.
He was gone.

632
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:33,860
He was in a weird other place and
when he snapped him out of it,

633
00:35:33,861 --> 00:35:38,490
you could tell the guy is, I don't
think they're that good of an actor.

634
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:42,590
I think that you are skeptical because
it wouldn't work on you at all and I

635
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,840
don't think it would work on me there.

636
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,030
But think about some of the shit
that people are willing to do.

637
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,410
Think about cults.

638
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,580
Think about people joining cults that
they think about people that believe that

639
00:35:53,581 --> 00:35:56,250
some,
some guy who lives in Siberia is Jesus.

640
00:35:56,251 --> 00:36:00,270
And so they're going to set up these
huts and live up there with Jesus because

641
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:03,390
Jesus is back and he lives in Siberia.
Do you have to be like,

642
00:36:03,391 --> 00:36:06,960
there's something has to be like really
wrong with your brain for you to accept

643
00:36:06,961 --> 00:36:07,620
that?

644
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:11,280
I think people's brains are jiff and
just like people's dicks are different.

645
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,293
That's what I think.

646
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:17,400
And I think some people you can just tell
them what to do and they'll just lock

647
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:20,750
into it and just do it. Yeah.
I mean, cause if you, we,

648
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,330
we know that like the first part of what
you said is true because it's happened

649
00:36:24,331 --> 00:36:28,380
in the past. People following cold. So
like, so what if that light, light, light,

650
00:36:28,381 --> 00:36:32,760
light, light is someone just doing
that for an hour? Like they'll do that.

651
00:36:32,761 --> 00:36:36,000
Why won't you just go, you know, like
there's yeah, right. People. Yeah.

652
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:40,870
There's a lot of your Ryka
I always, um, I always, uh,

653
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:43,650
forget that. I'm like, really? But
then you think, yeah, that's you.

654
00:36:43,651 --> 00:36:46,010
I'm thinking of me picking at me.
Yeah,

655
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:50,190
you can't think of you because you
have an extraordinary job. It's very,

656
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:55,191
you have a very unusual amount of people
that you come in contact with and share

657
00:36:55,231 --> 00:36:58,740
your ideas with and you're on stage
all the time. This is like your,

658
00:36:58,741 --> 00:37:02,400
your comfort level with
humans is different than
the average person's comfort

659
00:37:02,401 --> 00:37:05,040
level cause he experienced humans
and it's really extreme state,

660
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,750
the state of a standup comedy club.
So it's real hard to,

661
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,340
to just couldn't hypnotize a guy like you.

662
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:16,380
But there's some people out there that
have nine volt brains and you know,

663
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:20,280
everybody else has a, a bunch of those
lithium ions. They used to run a Tesla,

664
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,750
not this motherfucker.

665
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:26,520
He's got a nine volt brain just like God
gives some men two inch painting says

666
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:30,630
this guy has a nine volt brain
and that is what he's got.

667
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:31,890
You know,

668
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:36,030
and I say this from a person who's very
acutely aware of how smart I am or how

669
00:37:36,031 --> 00:37:38,730
lack of smart I am.
You put a math problem in front of me,

670
00:37:38,731 --> 00:37:42,780
I start fucking drooling. I'm an idiot.
I'm really bad when it comes to math.

671
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,180
Like I'm shockingly bad.
You know,

672
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:48,630
there's just shit I'm not
good at even slightly. But

673
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:54,630
I know that it's, I'm not confused.
You know what I mean? Could it,

674
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,410
cause you're able to know where you're,
you're right. I get what you're saying.

675
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,690
So I know there's different levels.

676
00:38:00,691 --> 00:38:04,190
I know there's people that are way
smarter than me. I just know it. I've a,

677
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:08,640
because mathematically I feel like I,
I'm, I'm horrible at math too. Right?

678
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,870
I know I didn't choose that.

679
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:14,190
That so you're saying there might be
people that get the math thing but then

680
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:16,980
socially or like given these
nine volt batteries and that's,

681
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,870
you think it's not changeable? I think
it is. I think if I had interest in,

682
00:38:20,871 --> 00:38:24,360
in mathematics, but what I'm saying
is I don't, and because I don't,

683
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,770
I don't have any knowledge of it,

684
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:27,780
so I'm really dumb when
it comes to that subject.

685
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,630
It's not something I've ever pursued.
So because of that,

686
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:35,250
I completely lack any comprehension
of like really advanced calculus.

687
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:39,010
And you only see like those physics guys,
I have zero knowledge of what that is.

688
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,240
It's because when I was a kid,

689
00:38:40,241 --> 00:38:44,770
I associated it very early with something
incredibly boring and because I did

690
00:38:44,771 --> 00:38:48,700
that, I just never put any effort into
it whatsoever. It wasn't rewarding to me.

691
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,330
I think that's what, yeah, I
think that's what makes things,

692
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:57,700
it's you should have a comprehensive
knowledge of how to count and divide and

693
00:38:57,701 --> 00:38:59,530
all those things.
The absolutely,

694
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,580
but it doesn't appeal to everybody and
to make a guy like you or make a guy like

695
00:39:03,581 --> 00:39:06,160
me chase after like really complex math,

696
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,260
it's not really beneficial because it's
not going to do anything more than let

697
00:39:11,261 --> 00:39:12,670
us know that we don't really like math,

698
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,300
especially in this day and age because
there's not a matter of there's a finite

699
00:39:16,301 --> 00:39:18,350
amount of time to learn things
when you're in high school,

700
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,950
finite amount of time in college
and finite amount of the time.

701
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,140
When you have a job,
he's so fucking small amount,

702
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:26,200
so cut out all the shit you're
not really that interested in.

703
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,000
There's plenty of fucking
calculators out there.

704
00:39:28,001 --> 00:39:30,730
Stop trying to be mister renaissance man.
When it comes to knowledge,

705
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:34,450
there's a calculator punching those
numbers, get it done. It's really easy.

706
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,370
Even help board don't or be a math guy.

707
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:40,930
I'm so bad at math. Now granted this
look sad or this looks Saturday.

708
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,750
This is going to tell Saturday than it is,
but it is a true story.

709
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:48,610
So it all has to do with math and how
bad I am and I have to tell you that I

710
00:39:48,611 --> 00:39:49,420
like bubble tape.

711
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,880
There's a reason I have to tell
you that because I don't know why,

712
00:39:51,881 --> 00:39:54,950
but I'll buy bubble tape. You
know pop, pop, pop stuff comes in.

713
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:57,250
It's like baseball tape
and you pull a piece out.

714
00:39:57,251 --> 00:40:00,820
You can make it like 10 feet long. You
know it's all in. It's all like in a,

715
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:03,230
it's like,
I know what I'm talking about.

716
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:08,050
It's like one big long piece of gum
and then you pull it out. It's gum,

717
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,850
you chew gum bubble, bubble
tape go. Oh. Oh, okay.

718
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:16,690
It's hard to, most people listening are
probably, they'll, they'll know. I'm like,

719
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,300
that's my,
that's like meet a nice way of me going.

720
00:40:19,301 --> 00:40:23,380
Everyone knows with you I think, but
I could be wrong. I bet you're right.

721
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,340
I'm an idiot. Um, so, uh, so anyway,

722
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:31,490
so I'm on the plane and I'm horrible
with numbers and I have like I'm at this,

723
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:34,190
I have a checkbook and I'm
opening it up, you know, cause I,

724
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:37,060
and I'm counting with my fingers
and I'm figuring something out.

725
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:40,420
And also then I take a piece of bubble
tape and I eat it at the same time.

726
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:44,620
And then I, there's a guy in my brief
and I look at him like, oh my God,

727
00:40:44,621 --> 00:40:49,090
I thought instantly what he had just seen
like not a man my age county with his

728
00:40:49,091 --> 00:40:52,430
fingers, you know, pull it Eaton bubble
tape. There's no way you think there's,

729
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:56,610
I have any amount of success. He has to
think, oh that poor guy, good for him.

730
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:01,630
Get on a plane and oh, am I one of the
look up? No, no, I swear everything.

731
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:05,470
All right. It looks very archaic
but I don't like I'm aware.

732
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,200
So it's funny that that's eccentric.

733
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:13,260
Like to eat childish sort of candy that
we have like in categorized like this is

734
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,870
candy for children. Well, it's true.
It's like if God forbid and I don't,

735
00:41:16,871 --> 00:41:20,890
so don't worry about judging me. Those
big lollipops you can get. Oh yeah.

736
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,920
What if you really liked go as a full
grown adult eating one of those big

737
00:41:26,321 --> 00:41:27,040
lollipop?

738
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,800
I think you should be able to do whatever
the fuck you want knickers on you.

739
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:30,880
I think it's so stupid.

740
00:41:30,881 --> 00:41:34,850
Can I tell you I wish you like those and
I'll tell you why. Because if you did,

741
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:38,990
I hang out with you every night and
just see if anyone gave you shit.

742
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:42,080
I would love to see it. What's up
man? You know I like these lollipops.

743
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:45,800
You would address it. The
lollipop industry would love
you because he'd be like,

744
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:48,570
it's Nice Joe Rogan's out there,
but they give him shit about eating.

745
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:51,770
The big lolly puppy tells him to go
fuck himself handedly bringing back the

746
00:41:51,771 --> 00:41:55,220
fanny pack, Todd glass or you can
go handedly. I wear it everywhere.

747
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,050
I wear it every time I go on the road.
People point to it.

748
00:41:57,051 --> 00:41:59,600
And you'll get the fuck out of here.
And I go, yeah, I'm wearing a fat.

749
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:02,030
It's fucking easy. It's easy
to travel with. You know?

750
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:05,120
I don't know if I'll ever wear one,
but I've said this a million times.

751
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:09,050
Why can't the fanny pack be cool to
where it is? I don't. I have shit.

752
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:13,340
Mike flew long nights just with
where to put pot. That lollipop.

753
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:18,570
Exactly the one I was thinking I
would eat one of those where you

754
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,910
talk last car confused. Look
at that fucking lollipop.
That's a lot of sugar sign.

755
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:27,500
How much sugar is that Todd glass.

756
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:31,430
That's a fucking hard piece
of sugar that weighs pounds.

757
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:34,160
I don't think it probably puts
you in a straight diabetic coma.

758
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,150
A girl should not eat that and not
be looking for and it guy or girl.

759
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,780
If you're out licking that lollipop
nonstop that Amar and I don't think if

760
00:42:41,781 --> 00:42:42,290
people,

761
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:47,030
you're going to attract some Weirdos board
or some people who really admire your

762
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:51,490
tongue. Exactly. Yeah. Maybe you
have a really sweet tongue. I mean,

763
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:52,310
you know,

764
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:55,430
some girls stick their tongues out and
they go all the way down their chin and

765
00:42:55,431 --> 00:42:58,580
he, yeah. [inaudible] your
friends would say, dad,

766
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:01,110
you're looking at that lollipop
and public. It's, you're,

767
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:02,810
you're only going to attract
the wrong type of guy.

768
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:06,640
You can't attract the right
type of guys. Fuck, hey,

769
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:11,750
let's get it as Josie has, would say,
let's get this party started, Brian. Okay.

770
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:16,310
Alright, listen, stop it. Brian.
Stop it. You confusing everything.

771
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:21,570
Um, yeah. Well I think like lollipops,
like anything else, man, look,

772
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:24,470
whatever the fuck you like this.
We aren't here for a long time.

773
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,190
If you like something, they just say
you like it and say why you like it.

774
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:31,250
And when, when I, when I say it was
bringing back the fanny pack, you know,

775
00:43:31,251 --> 00:43:33,500
people thought it was joking. Like
I've really never stopped wearing one.

776
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:36,470
When I travel I'd wear of the people
would constantly mocked me. I'm like,

777
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:38,390
I don't care. It's a fucking, it's,

778
00:43:38,391 --> 00:43:41,870
I think it's insane that I can wear
a backpack and no one gives a shit,

779
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,930
but everywhere pack down here, all of
a sudden it's something that's funny.

780
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:48,650
I'm like, that's gears. Nothing.
And here's the thing. You're right.

781
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,630
But here's the problem.
Here's the problem.

782
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:54,920
Like I know you're right and not only do
I know you're right, but the here comes,

783
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:59,240
there's the end part. Um, I've said
it over the last year so many times,

784
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:02,400
especially if if, uh, if you
have a pipe or a key I playing,

785
00:44:02,401 --> 00:44:04,790
I don't like to have my phone on me.
I thought she got damn it.

786
00:44:04,791 --> 00:44:06,530
Why can't fanny packs like I just said be,

787
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:11,300
why can't they be cool to
where we're bringing him back?
Todd glass? I don't know.

788
00:44:11,301 --> 00:44:15,470
If I have, I'd be too insecure. I be
too insecure. Just everywhere I went.

789
00:44:15,471 --> 00:44:17,240
People would be like, look,
that guy wearing a fanny pack.

790
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,250
He would feel like you
were being courageous,

791
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,310
but it makes courageous
and just carrying stuff.

792
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:29,060
Wear sweatpants. Fuck it. Sweatpants
and a fanny pack. Fuck him.

793
00:44:29,061 --> 00:44:32,970
Who am I dressing up for some
nice soft cotton sweatpants.

794
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,150
Those are like the most comfortable things
ever, you know? But we never wear him.

795
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:39,930
No. Let me get my and stiff
ass stupid plastic pants on.

796
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,860
You know what I was, uh,
last night in Santa Barbara,

797
00:44:43,861 --> 00:44:46,710
it was Halloween and there were some
people walking around in costumes. I go,

798
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,500
forget about the costume and what it is.
Just what they're able to wear.

799
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:52,140
Like a onesy right.
Walking around with, with,

800
00:44:52,141 --> 00:44:55,350
with the comfortable slippers
and they're comfortable.

801
00:44:55,351 --> 00:44:58,160
Like why can't they do that every
night? Maybe minus the, the,

802
00:44:58,161 --> 00:45:00,000
the costume part of it.
But like every,

803
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,360
I thought how many people are getting
to walk the streets in a freedom?

804
00:45:03,361 --> 00:45:07,380
It's like walking. It's like
swimming naked in a, in a
bathtub, in a pool. Probably.

805
00:45:07,381 --> 00:45:11,640
They're just walking around like with
all that, just comfortable shit. Right?

806
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:16,620
Like right. Cause you were saying, why
can't we just walk around and, yeah.

807
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:21,840
Like why, oh, in a fanny pack. Yeah, but
what would the type of pants you said? Oh,

808
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:24,120
sweatpants. Yeah, like nothing's
more comfortable in sweatpants.

809
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:26,510
So thing at one point were
giving up anything. We,

810
00:45:26,511 --> 00:45:29,010
we've developed the most
comfortable pair of pants there is,

811
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,210
but we choose to go
well but that's so many.

812
00:45:33,211 --> 00:45:38,211
Gave me a pair of these slippers that
are like kind of like borderline between

813
00:45:38,551 --> 00:45:41,910
slippers and a shoe.
It's real close.

814
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,430
I think they'll like uggs from
man or something like that.

815
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:48,750
The inside is all like golf fleecy
it's comfortable, so comfortable.

816
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:53,640
And so a friend of mine came over and uh,
I put them on and I go,

817
00:45:53,641 --> 00:45:57,210
hey man, what's up? And he goes, what are
you wearing? Fucking slippers is there,

818
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,970
are they the crocs, the ones with the
no, no, they weren't crocs. They're,

819
00:45:59,971 --> 00:46:00,510
they're like,

820
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:04,260
they're like leather on the outside but
they have like a lining and the lining

821
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:07,860
is like, like fleece, like like lamb
scan or whatever the hell did they have.

822
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,850
There was like, what does that slipper, I
was like, it's fucking shoe or something.

823
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,530
But to him it was like, it was like
he wears slippers bro. You're like,

824
00:46:16,531 --> 00:46:20,520
why are you wearing, what are you trying
to have fucking your feet be all soft.

825
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,420
Weird is against

826
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,610
something that feels good.
Why you wearing slippers?

827
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:35,880
He doesn't realize it. That's the thing
he doesn't realize, but breaking it down.

828
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:36,743
That's what he's saying.

829
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:39,720
You're wearing something that's more
comfortable than everybody else.

830
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,670
You're wearing slippers
anywhere in a fanny pack.

831
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,920
I might even say the same thing,
but at least I'm willing to.

832
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,560
I'm not from that one. If I see someone
wearing slippers, you know what?

833
00:46:46,561 --> 00:46:50,160
I'm gonna do goat. It's a great
idea. It's a fucking wonderful idea.

834
00:46:50,161 --> 00:46:53,110
How about rod and I mean, I
mean he, that's why, I mean I,

835
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:56,130
I want to live to be the age where I
can show up at the Improv in probably my

836
00:46:56,131 --> 00:46:58,950
pajamas. I took that for granted
when I used to see him doing that.

837
00:46:58,951 --> 00:47:00,910
He would then you sort of
wear pajamas and slippers.

838
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:05,700
He would wait bathrobe on stage with
nothing underneath it. I was working,

839
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:09,480
this is when I was working. I wasn't,
I, I saw him. I was getting paid.

840
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:10,980
I didn't know what the marketing arena,

841
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,610
I was working at great woods center for
the performing arts when I was 19 and

842
00:47:14,611 --> 00:47:18,540
Rodney was there backstage. He didn't
give a fuck. He had no underwear on,

843
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:21,780
no clothes on, who were fucking
bathrobe and everybody's like,

844
00:47:21,781 --> 00:47:25,930
it's caucus just fucking hanging out.
He doesn't give a shit. Rodney's, Hey,

845
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:30,220
what are you saying? What do you
say back there? Just getting fired

846
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:35,220
up on weed and he would go onstage in
his bathrobe and he fucking destroyed.

847
00:47:36,161 --> 00:47:39,330
There's the human, his bathrobe.
That's how he would dress backstage.

848
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:44,560
Paul's Bullshit. He didn't give a
fuck. He didn't give a fuck man.

849
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:47,950
He didn't want to wear anything but a
bathrobe and so he would go on stage like

850
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:52,090
that and he would feel so funny because
he was fucking naked up there and it was

851
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,420
half of the fun half the fun of the show.

852
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,210
I never knew the bathrobe thing
all it goes us the pajamas,

853
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:01,210
but that's just beautiful. I'll
never forget man. I was about,

854
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,020
I guess I was probably 19 years old
and I was in this back area where the

855
00:48:05,021 --> 00:48:08,980
performance go right before they go
onstage and I got a glimpse of Rodney like

856
00:48:08,981 --> 00:48:12,100
pacing before he went on in
his bathrobe and I wasn't even,

857
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:15,880
I had no comedic aspirations
back then whatsoever, like zero,

858
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,070
but I always loved stand up comedy and
so I remember looking in there and go to

859
00:48:20,071 --> 00:48:21,010
holy shit,

860
00:48:21,011 --> 00:48:25,610
that's fucking Rodney Dangerfield right
there and he's in a bathrobe and then we,

861
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,760
they would all tell me like
the guys who were backstage,

862
00:48:27,761 --> 00:48:29,470
the security was doing back
there, they were like, dude,

863
00:48:29,471 --> 00:48:33,880
his balls are hanging out and just
party and he gives zero fucks.

864
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,660
He's like 70 or something. I don't
know how he old, he was back then,

865
00:48:37,661 --> 00:48:42,340
but he had to be in his sixties like
deep in the 60s he was still doing blow.

866
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,840
He didn't give a fuck. He was a maniac.
You know the way, the way, it's awesome.

867
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:50,220
The way to explain what it was like,
explain what it was like to meet Rodney.

868
00:48:50,221 --> 00:48:53,790
I was trying to explain this. I think over
the years. I think once when I was, uh,

869
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:57,510
somebody in my family or something, I was
like, it was very hard. But I think I,

870
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,640
I can do a better job of it now,
but like,

871
00:48:59,641 --> 00:49:01,410
you know how we'll never
get to meet homer Simpson?

872
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:05,700
He's a character and you're not going
to get to meet Peter from the family.

873
00:49:05,701 --> 00:49:10,080
You know, you don't get to meet them.
You get to meet Rodney. Like you don't,

874
00:49:10,081 --> 00:49:12,810
you're not supposed to get to meet him.
He's so larger than life that it's hard.

875
00:49:12,811 --> 00:49:13,050
Yeah.

876
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:16,950
I have seen other people that are on TV
when I was younger and when I saw them

877
00:49:16,951 --> 00:49:21,000
in public, yes. I was like,
Oh yeah, there's that person.
But Rodney was different.

878
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,200
It was like, what the fuck that, that's
real. Because he was such, you know,

879
00:49:25,201 --> 00:49:28,500
like a cartoon character, you know
what I mean? In a good way. He was a,

880
00:49:28,501 --> 00:49:33,270
in the movies too, and he was like
larger than life was disrespectful,

881
00:49:33,271 --> 00:49:38,010
but he was, he was, he was, he was,
he was, it was, it was amazing.

882
00:49:38,011 --> 00:49:38,460
And then,

883
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:41,790
and then he knew and they capitalized
on it later with the suit and a red tie.

884
00:49:41,791 --> 00:49:45,570
And there you see this. Oh
my God. So anything he said,

885
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,860
I went once to see Bob Nelson
opened up for him and he,

886
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:51,870
it's not a great story,
but it's all I've got.

887
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:54,960
So any little piece that I happen to have
anything, I'm with Rodney, I'm happy,

888
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:58,920
you know? So I remember seeing him
and being like, that was just weird.

889
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:03,120
And then a Bob goes, hey, this
is Todd. He's from Philly.
And he goes, that's good.

890
00:50:03,121 --> 00:50:07,320
Philadelphia needs him.
We laughed so hard,

891
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,890
laugh so hard because it was funny.
But later when he left, I went,

892
00:50:10,891 --> 00:50:14,250
what did that mean? I don't know. No one
knew. It didn't matter what it meant.

893
00:50:14,251 --> 00:50:16,710
It was Rodney. And, and it's
not like we were fake laughing.

894
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,010
It was just him fucking be.
And that funding to go, they
pulled off. He needs him.

895
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:21,023
It was funny.

896
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:24,180
I got a chance to see him alive then.

897
00:50:24,181 --> 00:50:29,060
And then several years later at the
laugh, stop, uh, uh, laugh factory rather.

898
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:32,570
I got to see him at the laugh factory on
sunset a couple times there. Like when,

899
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,404
like what year?

900
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:38,650
I would say it was the 90s
and how it wasn't 90 days.

901
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:41,690
Did he go up and do it pretty
tight set hazing. He was killer.

902
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:46,520
Who's killed even back then. I mean
he, he didn't go onstage and half acid,

903
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:50,930
that's for sure. He was crushing. He
was really fun and he was just chilling,

904
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:54,080
hanging out. His wife was with him,
attractive woman who was like, you know,

905
00:50:54,081 --> 00:50:55,490
30 40 years younger than him.

906
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:58,430
It'd be just looked like he was
having a great fucking time.

907
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:01,250
He rode that thing right
into the fucking rocks.

908
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:06,460
He took that boat and just whoa
and wrote it right into the rocks.

909
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,820
And he's 70 years old and he's
crushing onstage, partying,

910
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:15,560
hanging out with a hot senorita. Jesus
Christ. He was an animal. That's,

911
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:18,470
that's, that's so much.
I, you know, that's,

912
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:20,750
when you look at it from that perspective,
it's like,

913
00:51:20,751 --> 00:51:24,710
just amplifies what you're already know
was like, yeah, fucking, he really did.

914
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,400
He really do day or you know,
I'm sure a lot of it's true,

915
00:51:28,401 --> 00:51:31,450
but the thing that most people know
is like by the time he could enjoy it,

916
00:51:31,451 --> 00:51:35,240
he felt it was too late, but he still
had a lot of fun. Right? Yeah. Oh,

917
00:51:35,241 --> 00:51:38,330
he had a great fucking time.
Yeah, he was Rodney Dangerfield.

918
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,780
He might as nice to people too.
That was the other thing about Rodney.

919
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:45,620
He helped comics out.
His Hbo specials were legendary.

920
00:51:45,621 --> 00:51:50,621
Like a lot of people don't really even
know like what a huge stand up he was.

921
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:55,730
He was a huge comedian, like great woods
where I worked, where he performed,

922
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,030
I mean I don't know how many thousands
of people it is and it has to be at least

923
00:51:59,031 --> 00:52:02,540
like seven or 8,000 people in the,
in the part that's covered.

924
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:06,860
And then there's like this back like
hill area that's like the grass,

925
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:10,640
which is all like open wandering around.
It was really crazy.

926
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:15,110
Like what their idea was ridiculous
because the idea was you would take these

927
00:52:15,111 --> 00:52:19,070
people and you and some of them would
be seated in his beautiful amphitheater

928
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:23,630
and then pass them.
You would just stuff the grass,

929
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:28,660
which is enormous patch of grass with
savages who couldn't hear anybody who was

930
00:52:28,911 --> 00:52:29,750
talking on stage.

931
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,830
So it was really unfortunate because like
he needs what you saw him? Yeah, yeah.

932
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:36,020
I got to see him close though.
I heard it.

933
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:38,390
But then I went to the grass
because people were complaining.

934
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:40,190
They were coming down.
They'd say, hey, we can't,

935
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,430
we can't understand a fucking word. He's
saying we've got tickets to the grass.

936
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:48,110
And so I went out to the grass and I was
like, oh no, you couldn't hear anything.

937
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:51,620
It was this weird echoey thing. So when
it would come out of the amphitheater,

938
00:52:51,621 --> 00:52:54,920
you had no idea what he's talking about.
You'd hear people laugh and you'd go,

939
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:59,390
Oh fuck, this is terrible. So will
they like ripped all these people off?

940
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:03,860
And so they, you know, the, unfortunately
it didn't get a chance to see him,

941
00:53:03,861 --> 00:53:08,060
but he was in his prime and he was,
this was, he was a really fucking,

942
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:11,630
really funny guy. But his big
thing was helping other Comedians,

943
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:16,640
those Hbo Comedy Festivals Launched
Kennison launched dice clay launched bill

944
00:53:16,641 --> 00:53:20,760
Hicks and, and you know what? I'm
going to give him a huge compliment.

945
00:53:20,761 --> 00:53:24,010
And it's not like I'm complimenting
myself cause I don't know if I, Hey,

946
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:26,070
we only can live to,
if I got to that point,

947
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,900
if I did what Rodney didn't,
but up to now I haven't.

948
00:53:27,901 --> 00:53:29,460
So I'm not doing it from
a place of judgment.

949
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:33,390
So it's nobody's job to come
and help other comedians. So we,

950
00:53:33,391 --> 00:53:35,310
I'm not saying it from that point
of view. No, no, no, no, no.

951
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:39,720
I'm saying it's just sometimes you get
someone that loves comedy so much that on

952
00:53:39,721 --> 00:53:41,010
their own they go,
you know what,

953
00:53:41,011 --> 00:53:43,770
there's some people I know are
fucking funny that, you know,

954
00:53:43,771 --> 00:53:46,350
back then it wasn't even TV.
There wasn't a lot of avenues.

955
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:48,600
So it was Rodney specials.
They weren't getting on the tonight show.

956
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:53,360
Some were did both, but a lot
were like his vehicle. So no one,

957
00:53:53,361 --> 00:53:57,780
since Rodney has ever done that. No. No
one. And if I'm wrong, I want to know.

958
00:53:57,781 --> 00:53:58,441
I don't want to be,
you know,

959
00:53:58,441 --> 00:54:01,080
I'm not saying like if somebody looks
something up and goes, this comedian did,

960
00:54:01,081 --> 00:54:02,190
I'd be like, well, they're cool too.

961
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:05,200
Martin Lawrence didn't, he
didn't? No, no, no, no, no.

962
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:07,720
Robert Townsend did a few of those.
He did a few of those.

963
00:54:07,721 --> 00:54:10,870
Then you do a few of those where he
brought up different comics like Damon

964
00:54:10,871 --> 00:54:14,290
Wayans. I remember did one
then, then so, so I like that.

965
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,350
That's a guy that kind of disappeared.
Robert Townsend. You remember that guy?

966
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:22,060
Yeah. Whatever happened to that guy. Yeah,
that's a good question. He just sort of,

967
00:54:22,061 --> 00:54:25,030
I don't know what happened that day. He
was really respected. It was hilarious.

968
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:29,170
He was really funny. Did he do, what did
he do? Um, it wasn't a Hollywood shuffle,

969
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,940
was it?
I don't know.

970
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:38,020
I'm not good with movies.
Yeah. I'm not eating them at
home. Yeah. Robert Townsend.

971
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:41,590
Oh my God. Yeah. He was hilarious, man.

972
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:43,631
Whatever happened.

973
00:54:43,631 --> 00:54:46,630
I remember that special where he came
at w what was the special where he came

974
00:54:46,631 --> 00:54:48,850
out and he was talking in
the accent and then he, oh,

975
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:50,920
he broke character after like a minute.
I don't remember.

976
00:54:50,921 --> 00:54:53,270
That was on one of Rodney's maybe was it?
Yeah,

977
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,820
but anyway,
I hope that came out right.

978
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:59,640
That's just very admirable that Rodney
did that and you know what made it even

979
00:54:59,641 --> 00:55:02,850
more admirable because he was so big.
It's not like he needed it.

980
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,810
Certain comedians may have done it when
they're at a point in their career when

981
00:55:06,811 --> 00:55:10,730
it needs them or they need it.
Rodney didn't need that. He,

982
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:15,360
I think he used his power to get a
special and do something you wanted to do.

983
00:55:15,361 --> 00:55:17,790
I don't think he needed that.
Like Rodney, they called you.

984
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:21,780
They want you to host this. It was
something he perpetuated the, he had sorta

985
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:23,910
past.
That's why it was sorta cool.

986
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:27,720
This is Robert towns right here is this
Hollywood shuffle. Meteor man. Meteor man.

987
00:55:27,721 --> 00:55:32,040
He did a lot of really funny movies,
man. And he was a funny comic too. Yeah.

988
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:37,390
Yeah. What's he doing now? I
don't know where is it? Maybe
just said, you know what,

989
00:55:37,391 --> 00:55:38,224
I'm good.

990
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:43,320
He's only 56 you knew also dresses like
pretty much how they want on stage and

991
00:55:43,321 --> 00:55:45,180
almost every day is don Barris.
He'll,

992
00:55:45,181 --> 00:55:49,190
he'll just wear like boxers and
my jetpack. Yeah, well that's,

993
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:54,660
that's the thing, you know, be
uncomfortable. What do you wear on stage?

994
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:58,980
Whatever I'm wearing, I'd like to wear
something that's not too distracting.

995
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,950
I like to wear something
that's a comfortable just,

996
00:56:01,951 --> 00:56:05,910
I usually like to wear like I work,
converse all stars pretty much every day.

997
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:10,110
Once I started wearing those, I realize
like if I wear a regular shoe now,

998
00:56:10,111 --> 00:56:12,120
like anything that has a heel,
like a running shoe,

999
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:14,580
it feels weird to be like
in that different posture.

1000
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:16,200
You're not supposed to stand like that.

1001
00:56:16,201 --> 00:56:19,460
I suppose stand flat and outside were
like them because they're flat and

1002
00:56:19,461 --> 00:56:23,710
comfortable. You feel as you're tilting
forward you are. We just, I'm so,

1003
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:27,310
it's so rare for me. The only time I
wear shoe shoes is want to do the UFC.

1004
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:27,941
Do you think?

1005
00:56:27,941 --> 00:56:31,930
Do you think like even I know exactly
what you're talking about because I've put

1006
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,820
the,
I get used to it after a while,

1007
00:56:33,821 --> 00:56:35,810
but there's a pair of boots and after
I'm not wearing them for a while ago.

1008
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:40,630
What am I, what's the go forward here? So
we're women do that. Do you think that,

1009
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:45,220
yes, I'm going to take from that to this,
but I'm curious of your opinion on this.

1010
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:49,510
Do you think like for women wearing high
heels it might hurt them more than they

1011
00:56:49,511 --> 00:56:52,180
may be think cause it's a
horrible thing to do to yourself?

1012
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,600
I think it's probably, and it is
really difficult to do every day.

1013
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:59,200
I think women who wear them
everyday just to, to uh, their job.

1014
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:02,830
I like to wear high heels around the
office constantly and that's all you were

1015
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,400
at work. Ooh, I got to think that's
brutal and punishing on your feet.

1016
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:09,730
I got to think that. Yeah. I don't see
how it couldn't be. Could you be doing,

1017
00:57:09,731 --> 00:57:11,350
let me ask you this.
Some people will go,

1018
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,600
could you be doing it just for yourself
instead of putting it from, you know,

1019
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:18,910
so he could, I know I don't. You could be.
Yeah, they could do it for other girls.

1020
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:19,840
There's,
well,

1021
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:24,220
there's a misperception about women that
everything they do is to attract men

1022
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:27,730
and as that's certainly has some
merit to it, but it's not everything.

1023
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,330
They also do it to show up
other girls like girls and,

1024
00:57:31,331 --> 00:57:34,810
and to be like impressive to other girls.
Oh that's that Chinese thing,

1025
00:57:34,811 --> 00:57:38,020
that foot binding thing that they
do. Whoa. Where they smashed.

1026
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:43,060
They smashed their feet down.
They want their feet to be small.

1027
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:44,950
People are so crazy.

1028
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:50,790
The size of the feet means so much to
them buying their feet up into this crazy

1029
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:55,840
positions. Oh, that's so crazy
at all the things that people do.

1030
00:57:55,841 --> 00:57:57,190
That is one of the weirdest ones.

1031
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:00,190
All the body modification things
that people do culturally,

1032
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:04,420
like really common body modifications.
The foot binding one is so bizarre.

1033
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:09,160
Like really, really fucking weird. Yeah.
That's not just respecting other cultures.

1034
00:58:09,161 --> 00:58:11,830
That's, come on, that's a port.
There's a problem. It's torture.

1035
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:15,460
There's something sane about it.
Women in Africa that are, uh,

1036
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,530
the Suaree women who are the,

1037
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:21,970
I think it's Surrey where they make that,
that big plate in their face.

1038
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:25,720
The young ones are rejecting it now
they're going, fuck that. This is crazy.

1039
00:58:25,721 --> 00:58:27,970
Like I'm not wearing a fucking plate in
my lip anymore. And like they're like,

1040
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:29,140
they're getting sorta like,
uh,

1041
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:32,350
there's a cultural rift with the young
ones don't want to knock their teeth out

1042
00:58:32,351 --> 00:58:34,630
and where this plate you have to knock
your lower teeth out to where those

1043
00:58:34,631 --> 00:58:39,010
plates, it's fucking cool. You know,

1044
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:40,870
their knowledge cause the,

1045
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:44,320
cause we're in a computer age where
they're give there. Yeah, that's,

1046
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:45,761
they're not even getting,

1047
00:58:45,761 --> 00:58:49,480
I don't even think they're getting that
much impact from the computer world and

1048
00:58:49,481 --> 00:58:52,540
these like really remote tribes.
I'm not sure I probably be wrong.

1049
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,500
I'm probably wrong.

1050
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:56,890
It's probably someone with a laptop and
a fucking cellular connection that gets

1051
00:58:56,891 --> 00:58:59,180
online or something when I got
to feel like you're wearing it,

1052
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:01,810
you and me really super
tribal environment.

1053
00:59:01,811 --> 00:59:05,350
They've topless wearing skins and stuff.

1054
00:59:05,351 --> 00:59:07,330
Like some of them it's like really crazy.
Like,

1055
00:59:07,331 --> 00:59:11,410
how similar that the way they are living
today as the way they were living like

1056
00:59:11,411 --> 00:59:14,860
hundreds of thousands of years ago.
What were we talking about? Right.

1057
00:59:14,861 --> 00:59:19,540
But like just uh, leading up to this but
the same thing. Um, body modifications.

1058
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:21,740
Foot binding. Oh yeah,
the foot binding. Yeah.

1059
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:24,470
What I was thinking there's got
to be one of your listeners could,

1060
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:26,690
could look this up for
you guys or you could,

1061
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,350
there's gotta be someone that's
living today that did that,

1062
00:59:30,351 --> 00:59:34,120
but move past it in this world.
There's got to be one that tells a story.

1063
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:37,910
Do your foot. I think once your
foot's bound up your fox or did it,

1064
00:59:37,911 --> 00:59:39,050
but then you're right.
I'm sorry,

1065
00:59:39,051 --> 00:59:42,690
did it and then tells the story like move
past it mentally is a point going and

1066
00:59:42,691 --> 00:59:44,800
that was what am I doing
and how do you know people,

1067
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,640
I don't know how you would do that though.

1068
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:49,470
Like can it be somebody is
stuck like that forever? No,

1069
00:59:49,471 --> 00:59:52,870
no one do your thought like explain
the thought process. Well it's,

1070
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:55,070
I think it's just cultural
conditioning. You know, there's,

1071
00:59:55,430 --> 01:00:00,430
we have a we really weird problem as
human beings that once a group of us start

1072
01:00:00,531 --> 01:00:03,530
doing a thing, even if that
thing is ultimately detrimental,

1073
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:08,030
once a group of us start doing it,
people want to join in, it seems normal.

1074
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:11,420
We can rationalize because other ones
are doing it. It's, it makes sense.

1075
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:13,580
That's how the lip thing gets started.

1076
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,310
They put this giant plate in your
lip and the bigger the plate,

1077
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:20,600
the more cattle you're worth. What
does that noise, do you hear that?

1078
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:21,531
You know what I thought it was,

1079
01:00:21,531 --> 01:00:25,790
I thought you were bringing in like a
sound effects. Yeah. It sounds like,

1080
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,630
is it an airplane? Yeah.
Crash space shuttle.

1081
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:34,910
I'm sure. What, okay.
Whatever. What was my point?

1082
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:40,900
I was doing my ventriloquism. That's
pretty good. Look what was my point?

1083
01:00:40,901 --> 01:00:44,680
What was it like? Oh, we were talking
about, um, um, oh, the, the modification,

1084
01:00:44,681 --> 01:00:48,580
the foot binding saying all that stuff
was really bizarre. Yeah. The, the uh,

1085
01:00:48,581 --> 01:00:51,110
the foot binding, the lip
thing, you know, it's,

1086
01:00:51,111 --> 01:00:55,720
it's really bizarre that there's these
cultures out there that are really still

1087
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:58,660
like super, super primitive.
You know, to this day,

1088
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,540
apparently a lot of them were like
really fucking happy and healthy though.

1089
01:01:01,541 --> 01:01:05,110
That's the weird thing about these
indigenous people. When you find them,

1090
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:08,760
you don't find a lot of like problems
that a lot of people in the city have like

1091
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:11,050
psychological problems.
It's very rare.

1092
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:14,620
It's very rare that people have like
psychological issues while they're the

1093
01:01:14,621 --> 01:01:19,240
winners. Right? I mean, seriously.
Oh, if they're happy, I guess so,

1094
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:23,980
but I don't think it's impossible to
be happy in this world. I, you know,

1095
01:01:23,981 --> 01:01:26,890
I think that there's a lot of
people that don't get there,

1096
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:28,390
but I think it's possible.

1097
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:30,640
I think it's possible for anybody
to be happy in this world.

1098
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:35,170
I think did this world though is insanely
complex and it requires a much more

1099
01:01:35,171 --> 01:01:39,520
rigid idea of what you're going to accept
and not accept in your life and what

1100
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:42,400
what you're going to put out there and
what you're going to try to get back now.

1101
01:01:42,401 --> 01:01:45,400
I think that that's, it's
very, very, very complex.

1102
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:50,401
This is an insanely intricate in woven
society and these cultural tribes.

1103
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:54,970
That's really what we're designed for.
We're designed for these, you know,

1104
01:01:54,971 --> 01:01:58,150
these environments,
these places where as you know,

1105
01:01:58,151 --> 01:02:00,900
500 of us that live in a village together.
That's,

1106
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:03,070
that's what we're designed
for psychologically.

1107
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:05,900
That's what our brains are designed for.
When we,

1108
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,340
you jack it up to 7 billion
people in contact with each other,

1109
01:02:09,341 --> 01:02:12,520
it's going to require some adjustments
and that's what we're going through right

1110
01:02:12,521 --> 01:02:14,010
now.
It's not that they're,

1111
01:02:14,011 --> 01:02:17,920
it's going to be impossible for people
to be happy in this crazy day and age.

1112
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:20,970
It's just a little bit
more to manage and it a,

1113
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,650
it brings you to this
movie that I just watched.

1114
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:27,150
I was on a plane coming back from England
and I watched a summertime in Paris.

1115
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:30,020
I think it's, that's what it is.
Is that Woody Allen's moving?

1116
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:33,930
Was it summertime in Paris? Let me see
if it's, it's the Owen Wilson movie.

1117
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:39,840
Well, that's what I was, what was
really funny. He was doing woody Allen

1118
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:45,330
movie. Woody Allen movie. Come on.
What's the movie? Springtime. Paris,

1119
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:48,210
forget your trouble.
Who's,

1120
01:02:48,211 --> 01:02:53,130
come on when you Google woody Allen in
midnight in Paris. That's what it is.

1121
01:02:53,131 --> 01:02:56,980
Midnight in Paris. Sorry.
Not Summertime and, uh, it,

1122
01:02:57,110 --> 01:03:01,590
it was hilarious in this weird, it was,
well, it was a good movie first of all,

1123
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:05,200
but it was, what's it
about? It's about a guy, um,

1124
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,250
it's basically a woody Allen movie.
He's woody Allen.

1125
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:11,760
Owen Wilson's doing woody Allen like eve,
his mannerisms,

1126
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:15,450
but he's not admitting it. No, no, no.
He's not admitting it at all. He's like,

1127
01:03:15,451 --> 01:03:16,530
is this a trailer for it?

1128
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:19,960
Is that one of those things that nobody
will watch how he does it? Like what?

1129
01:03:20,890 --> 01:03:21,723
Yeah,

1130
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:29,290
he's so measured and even
it's very woody Allen. Like,

1131
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,720
that's great.
We can spend some time together,

1132
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:38,840
a lot of commitments, but
I'm sure it's, well, what,

1133
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:43,660
yeah. Did you have your slippers on when
you watch this? Oh, snake, that's worth,

1134
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:44,980
because I was blessed by his wife.

1135
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:49,790
He was never married to Ron Antisocial,

1136
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:54,600
quite as taken with him as you are.
It's a pseudo in electrical,

1137
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:59,450
slightly more tannic than the 59.
Okay.

1138
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,950
I don't remember what thinking
you're right. And then I go,

1139
01:04:02,951 --> 01:04:06,010
don't just say he's right to say he's
right. Like Todd really pay attention.

1140
01:04:06,011 --> 01:04:09,160
But that's, once you look
for it, then you just see it.

1141
01:04:09,161 --> 01:04:13,630
Every single joke he's doing what he, and
he does it brilliantly. It's brilliant.

1142
01:04:13,631 --> 01:04:16,960
He's really amazing. And this movie
is that perfect? What would, would,

1143
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:20,680
would his contemporaries think he should
just sort of give an homage to it or do

1144
01:04:20,681 --> 01:04:24,700
you have to mention it? I don't know
if you do, but that's what he's doing.

1145
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,880
I think what he wrote it for,
it means to playing a character.

1146
01:04:27,881 --> 01:04:30,610
Obviously he's not playing
Owen Wilson. What do, yeah,
what do you need to read it?

1147
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:35,010
Oh, he did woody Allen Film. He
didn't know it was woody Allen did.

1148
01:04:35,011 --> 01:04:39,700
And yes, it's a woody Allen film. So
let me see if, what if I ran out crying?

1149
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:42,160
I don't want to get a writer
and director Woody Allen.

1150
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:45,560
It's so obviously woody Allen
movie that basically, Oh,

1151
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,770
and him agreed that he
would do it as woody Allen.

1152
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,610
So it's like he can't do those movies
anymore, but he's got them in his head,

1153
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,490
you know, so what it but what he
can really star and movies anymore.

1154
01:04:54,491 --> 01:04:57,640
People don't want to see him anymore.
That whole thing with his daughter,

1155
01:04:57,641 --> 01:04:58,474
and this is just,

1156
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:03,370
it got so weird with so many people that
regardless of whether they're happy or

1157
01:05:03,371 --> 01:05:07,000
not, it's so tie boot taboo that
they've sort of ostracized him.

1158
01:05:07,001 --> 01:05:10,450
They allow him to be behind the scenes,
but if he's in front of the camera,

1159
01:05:10,451 --> 01:05:13,930
like people are really sketchy about it.
Unfortunately or fortunately,

1160
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:17,740
what could this work for him and
yes, we'll do it. You get on Wilson,

1161
01:05:17,741 --> 01:05:21,460
do every fucking movie and do it as Woody
Allen and woody on and can crank out a

1162
01:05:21,461 --> 01:05:24,190
million fucking hits. It would
be amazing. I'm telling you,

1163
01:05:24,191 --> 01:05:26,650
this movie did not get
nearly as much credit,

1164
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:31,150
like it only got a 7.7 on the IMD be,
I dunno if that's good or bad,

1165
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:36,160
but I thought it was a, it was a woody
Allen movie and if you take again,

1166
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:40,150
some people are not willing to take away
their feelings of him as an individual

1167
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:43,770
shields work. I don't know. I,

1168
01:05:43,790 --> 01:05:48,280
I know there was some madness with
him and his wife and the, you know,

1169
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:52,420
the Wyatt mentioned his wife.
She, uh, well, you know,

1170
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:56,680
that woman makes it look like,
what was her name? Woody Allen.

1171
01:05:56,681 --> 01:06:00,520
Then Mia Farrow, Mia
Farrow, and uh, he looked,

1172
01:06:00,521 --> 01:06:02,320
man threw a cup of
fucking Hollywood people.

1173
01:06:02,321 --> 01:06:05,110
Who knows what the fuck the truth really
is. There are a bunch of nutty people,

1174
01:06:05,111 --> 01:06:09,910
but ultimately he wound up leaving
with her adopted daughter. Yes,

1175
01:06:09,911 --> 01:06:14,620
I know about that dance. You
know? That's crazy, man. I mean,

1176
01:06:14,621 --> 01:06:18,420
he was with her from the time
when she was like to, you know,

1177
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:22,510
don't try to be funny. You have an opinion
about that. That's, that's fucked up.

1178
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:25,630
Yeah. I mean, I think they adopted
her when she was a baby. She was,

1179
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:30,280
wasn't his biological daughter. So, you
know, it's true. Obviously judgment,

1180
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:33,250
all the judgments, all the
judgment is fine. But if it's not,

1181
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:38,380
what if he has a relationship
with her kids with her?

1182
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,840
Oh No. You know, what am I saying
it's true or not. If it's true,

1183
01:06:40,841 --> 01:06:43,150
it's definitely true. That's right.
That's right. It's the moral judgment.

1184
01:06:43,151 --> 01:06:45,910
It's like if she became a woman
and that's what she really wanted,

1185
01:06:45,911 --> 01:06:48,550
and that's what he really wanted.
Is that a bad thing? You know,

1186
01:06:48,551 --> 01:06:52,420
everybody wants to decide that it is and
I think you know ultimately that's the

1187
01:06:52,421 --> 01:06:55,100
snap judgment and that's the one
that I would take. I would go, oh,

1188
01:06:55,101 --> 01:06:58,900
he's a fucking creep. That's his
daughter. I hate to say this,

1189
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:04,440
but when we're dealing with what you
should and shouldn't be able to do and if

1190
01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:10,570
ultimately this is what two adult people
want to do, it sounds disgusting to me,

1191
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:16,080
but I don't feel like it's
within my jurisdiction to
tell adult people what they

1192
01:07:17,321 --> 01:07:19,990
can and can't do together,
whether it's a brother and sister.

1193
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:22,960
Her brother and sister are in their
forties and they started decided to start

1194
01:07:22,961 --> 01:07:25,900
fucking each other. Why
do I care? The only,

1195
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,930
the only reason why I would care as if
they decided to make children and it can

1196
01:07:28,931 --> 01:07:32,830
be some harm to the children. Why is it
a law against them fucking each other?

1197
01:07:32,831 --> 01:07:35,170
I mean I don't, I don't want to do
it to my sister. I love my sister.

1198
01:07:35,171 --> 01:07:38,980
She's my sister. It would make me
feel disgusting to have sex with her.

1199
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:43,360
I've never thought about it once. But
if you do, what do I give a fuck can,

1200
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:47,070
can I tell you why I don't care if I had
to, like I call it gun to my head go,

1201
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:49,890
which way's better your way
or the way we do it now?

1202
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:55,140
I always say go on that way
because every time we evolve,

1203
01:07:55,141 --> 01:07:58,860
we don't look past and may think we made
any mistakes. And you know what I mean?

1204
01:07:58,861 --> 01:08:01,870
Never went. You know the one group
we were too fair to. Who knows?

1205
01:08:01,871 --> 01:08:03,120
Like it just seems like it always,

1206
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:06,180
the story's going to be most
likely everything you're saying.

1207
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:08,220
And like who knows what
year there'll be like,

1208
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:11,550
there'll be some kid off to go wet.
It used to be wrong to date. Your,

1209
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:15,620
your brother told be like, yeah, I
mean years or they would the, you know,

1210
01:08:15,621 --> 01:08:16,070
they'll tell the

1211
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:19,670
story and she about who you fuck.
Yeah, no to me. And it's funny than me.

1212
01:08:19,671 --> 01:08:22,390
And you both need to say
because it doesn't have,

1213
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:23,810
it doesn't have interesting introspect.

1214
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:28,190
If it's interesting to one of us to think
of having sex with my brother fucking

1215
01:08:28,191 --> 01:08:31,640
at the group. I don't get
where I'm at by the, I get by.

1216
01:08:31,641 --> 01:08:33,170
That's what everyone else
does. They think, well,

1217
01:08:33,171 --> 01:08:35,450
I wouldn't want to have sex with
that person. So that was be gross.

1218
01:08:35,451 --> 01:08:38,090
That's what people think of gay people.
So I'm,

1219
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:41,840
am I turning around and doing that to
another group right now? I don't know,

1220
01:08:41,841 --> 01:08:45,470
but fuck it. I'm Aaron on your side and
going leave everybody the fuck alone.

1221
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:49,700
I think as long as you're dealing with
two sober adults, that's, you know, I got,

1222
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:51,860
whenever I'm high and I talk about stuff,
I get nervous.

1223
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:54,830
That would be the one detail that I would
look like an idiot if I go, wait, Todd,

1224
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:57,950
that was between this age and
that age go, oh my God. No,

1225
01:08:57,951 --> 01:09:02,840
I was thinking of consenting
adults, consenting adults. Uh,

1226
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:08,170
yeah, 18 and over you, you know,
mistakes are no mistakes. You're,

1227
01:09:08,171 --> 01:09:09,470
you're certainly going to make them.

1228
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:13,190
You're responsible for a certain amount
of your actions from a certain age on

1229
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:15,770
you. You should. You should. It
should be very difficult to trick you.

1230
01:09:15,890 --> 01:09:16,790
That's what we try to do.

1231
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:19,610
We tried to make it legal to fuck you
when it's really difficult to trick you.

1232
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:22,790
Really, people should be able
to fuck until they're 30 okay.

1233
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:27,320
It should be illegal to fucking under
that standard. I'm petrified right now.

1234
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:30,350
I'm sorry I wasn't listening
because I'm petrified to think.

1235
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:35,540
Did I just say that being gay
was like fucking your brothers?

1236
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,000
No,
I didn't say that right now.

1237
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:42,350
You said that that's how some
people would feel about being gay,

1238
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:47,450
that you, you as a gay man, a repulsed
by the idea of fucking your brother,

1239
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,690
but some people would think
about that as gay sex. You know,

1240
01:09:50,691 --> 01:09:54,510
just just have a brother and sister.
Make it brothers and sisters. No,

1241
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:59,720
it's a perfect analogy because why does
anyone care what two people that are

1242
01:09:59,721 --> 01:10:03,800
adults decide to do, whether it's two
women or two men or for women and six men?

1243
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:07,880
Who cares if they are all in agreement
and they all are consenting and

1244
01:10:07,881 --> 01:10:11,630
everybody's sober and no one gets tricky
because there's plenty of people making

1245
01:10:11,631 --> 01:10:15,530
psychological mistakes by who
they date it, whether it's so,

1246
01:10:15,531 --> 01:10:18,830
whether even if it's cause it's a guy
and a girl there. There's other, yeah,

1247
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:23,250
a million reasons. So this is
one more, maybe you shouldn't
do it. And why it's, I,

1248
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:26,210
I was sort of halfway knew I was
going and then I got lost. Well,

1249
01:10:26,211 --> 01:10:30,380
the idea of someone being able to tell
someone else what they should enjoy,

1250
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:34,060
whether it's sex or music or
anything, right. Even if we write,

1251
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:38,480
if you're a person who likes
getting your feet sucked,

1252
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:42,220
you love it and everybody else
thinks it's fucking disgusting. If,

1253
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:46,280
if someone else like sucking feet and
you two get together, that's awesome.

1254
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:47,150
You know,

1255
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:50,000
immediate might freak you out if that's
your next door neighbor and you're like,

1256
01:10:50,001 --> 01:10:53,120
hey, just sucks feed all the time.
They go over the guy's house,

1257
01:10:53,121 --> 01:10:56,060
his feet all over the wall
and it's fucking feet phones.

1258
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:00,940
He's just a crazy flood soccer,
you know, don't get no one.

1259
01:11:01,610 --> 01:11:02,510
You know what I sort of,

1260
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,450
what I sort of get from what you're saying
right now is that like, and it's good.

1261
01:11:05,451 --> 01:11:06,620
I like to remind myself,

1262
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:11,000
I figured myself as lead everybody the
fuck alone and don't judge everybody and

1263
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:15,090
just, I know they think as long
as maybe I catch myself doing, oh,

1264
01:11:15,091 --> 01:11:19,740
of course you can have limitations where
you can say there's obviously that's a

1265
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:24,390
two consenting fucking adults. But maybe
even though I think I'm open minded,

1266
01:11:24,391 --> 01:11:28,680
you're right like that, you
know, why would make judgment
on someone you're right.

1267
01:11:28,681 --> 01:11:31,660
Maybe or make stupid jokes like that
to what you were just talking about.

1268
01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:35,280
The foot sucky, but what, why the fuck
I don't want to be that person. Yeah.

1269
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:37,530
He likes feet.
Somebody black stocking feet.

1270
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:42,410
I don't want to be the person who
goes, hey, you know that guy. Yeah,

1271
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:43,980
it's weird.
We all do it.

1272
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:48,500
I think we do it also because we're
insecure and because it's also not even

1273
01:11:48,690 --> 01:11:49,610
necessarily, and it's, it's,

1274
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:52,980
it's a jump reaction that people have
to something that's very different from

1275
01:11:52,981 --> 01:11:53,880
them.
And guess what?

1276
01:11:53,881 --> 01:11:56,460
If you found it out and I'm saying maybe
someone hearing this would be like,

1277
01:11:56,461 --> 01:11:58,650
you know what? I might do
that, but now I'm not going to,

1278
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:02,190
here's what it is like you don't want
to be that person that goes, hey,

1279
01:12:02,191 --> 01:12:06,210
you know that guy for no reason at all
and found that out about that person.

1280
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:11,000
Two years later you're still going. Yeah,
he's a good guy. He likes slugging feed.

1281
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:13,440
How do you know how some picture
got published and you don't?

1282
01:12:13,441 --> 01:12:15,690
Why would you want to prepare? Why do
you have to keep telling everybody that?

1283
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:17,070
Why do you now look,

1284
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:21,950
I don't like sucking feet and I don't
want everyone to get nervous. Your me.

1285
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:26,100
Oh, that's a joke. I was doing a
sketch feet and a sketch schedule,

1286
01:12:26,101 --> 01:12:31,101
like if you had a picture that was an
old SNL audition that I used to make my

1287
01:12:31,111 --> 01:12:36,060
own tapes was this thing I used
to do. That's hilarious. So funny.

1288
01:12:36,061 --> 01:12:38,250
Jesus, I'm leaving. I'm
going to leave. I'm going to,

1289
01:12:38,530 --> 01:12:41,280
I'm going to leave it more people alone.
That's all I want to do.

1290
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:44,530
That just saying it's fine. You're not
alienating anybody with foot soccer's.

1291
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:47,010
Oh yeah. That, I know. It's a small
segment and you don't have to worry.

1292
01:12:47,011 --> 01:12:50,490
They could laugh at it. That's my rule.
Like I think I tried it here to that,

1293
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:53,610
like someone that did suck feet could
listen to this, you know? Yeah. And laugh.

1294
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:55,050
Yeah. I don't think they're
going to be offended.

1295
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:56,730
I think we're pretty much
giving them the green light.

1296
01:12:56,910 --> 01:12:59,850
Thank you for giving everybody the
green light is that you're not hurting

1297
01:12:59,851 --> 01:13:02,220
anybody else,
but it's one of those things where like,

1298
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:05,010
have you ever told someone that you
like a certain thing and they go, oh,

1299
01:13:05,011 --> 01:13:08,640
that fucking sucks, but it doesn't
suck to me. Do you know? I like it.

1300
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:12,330
I actually do like it. I like this
band. I liked that. And like food. Yeah.

1301
01:13:12,331 --> 01:13:15,990
It's like so many things
that were comfortable to talk
about that we don't like.

1302
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:19,440
No one has to be lie. They like
Italian food, but some areas it's like

1303
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:25,230
you have like Kimchi, get the
fuck outta here. You like Kimchi,

1304
01:13:25,231 --> 01:13:29,550
they'll get mad at you. You like Kimchi.
I'm like, go. I buy it. I like it.

1305
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:34,980
It's delicious. Leave me alone. No, I
mean like fuck is wrong with you bro.

1306
01:13:34,981 --> 01:13:37,770
You're eating Kimchi over there.
It would never do that if someone goes,

1307
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:42,000
you got to read you like a red car.
People live. Yeah. Yeah, like different.

1308
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:46,080
Red is a little tricky,
right? It's a little douchey.
Why? I don't have a red car.

1309
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:50,310
A red sports car. Almost got
one. Did he never had a red car?

1310
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:54,990
What color is your car? Just getting
a red core colors. Your car. I silly.

1311
01:13:54,991 --> 01:13:59,280
I get silly. What color is white?
What kind of car? It's a Porsche.

1312
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:03,630
And is it a of Kuwait? I
wouldn't even ask. I was going
to say, is it a four door?

1313
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:07,980
No, no, no, but they make
those now. I know. I know.
Here's the, here's the thing.

1314
01:14:07,981 --> 01:14:09,990
I thought like, you know how when
you don't know? I don't know.

1315
01:14:09,991 --> 01:14:13,390
Like it seems to be, it was one person I
knew that likes Porsches were like, no,

1316
01:14:13,391 --> 01:14:14,680
that's not cool. And then I thought, Oh,

1317
01:14:14,681 --> 01:14:18,460
do people think they're not cool but not
knowing. When I just saw one, I was like,

1318
01:14:18,461 --> 01:14:20,500
fog,
like I don't even not,

1319
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:23,830
it's not the type of car usually
like just looked like a cool sedan.

1320
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:26,510
I didn't know it was a portion
until I looked. There's a problem

1321
01:14:26,690 --> 01:14:28,940
people have with a rich people,

1322
01:14:28,941 --> 01:14:32,450
items like that and that
they automatically dismiss
them as being a douchey

1323
01:14:32,451 --> 01:14:34,280
thing to have because so
many douchey people on them,

1324
01:14:34,610 --> 01:14:37,970
but the reality is what they
are is marvels of engineering.

1325
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:42,800
There are these amazing creations by
these geniuses and artisans. I mean,

1326
01:14:42,801 --> 01:14:46,550
to me that's what it is. It's an
expression of art. It's geometric art,

1327
01:14:46,551 --> 01:14:50,800
it's functional mechanical art. They
figured out how to make this exciting,

1328
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:54,740
exhilarating thing that performs in a
way that other cars don't and it looks

1329
01:14:54,741 --> 01:14:58,400
great. It's like a cool, sleek, like
I liked the way they designed it.

1330
01:14:58,401 --> 01:15:00,290
I think it's a beautiful
piece of engineering.

1331
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:00,520
No,

1332
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:03,490
it's funny you mentioned that because
there's something I'd probably do like I

1333
01:15:03,491 --> 01:15:06,610
sometimes, like we've talked about on
the show that I wouldn't want to pull up.

1334
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:10,720
There's a lot of cars where I do my
show. I looked down on these cars. Oh,

1335
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:14,500
there's so many that I fucking love.
Like I could just,

1336
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,320
I get it to sightlines.
I'm more of an SUV guy I think,

1337
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:18,850
but I can look at so many of those,

1338
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,850
but I wouldn't drive onto the Improv
because I've said this on my show.

1339
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:24,810
I go because I don't know you,
but what the fuck? Why? Why?

1340
01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:28,030
That's like doing exactly the
opposite of what I preached to do.

1341
01:15:28,031 --> 01:15:32,200
It's like an eye prejudge. I
do. I prejudge instead of, but,

1342
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:37,090
but I know that's person might drive
it up for the same reason that I sit

1343
01:15:37,091 --> 01:15:40,790
upstairs and look down at the cars and
go, fuck, look at that one. Look at that.

1344
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:43,430
We go over and we touch in the
paint feels different therapy,

1345
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:48,360
but yet I would be afraid to do it.
Well maybe you shouldn't be the Mar.

1346
01:15:48,361 --> 01:15:49,420
I'm going to buy a Dune buggy.

1347
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:54,340
But if that's the car that's one of those
crazy VW bugs and has like the extra

1348
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:57,730
wide fender flares,
engine exposed,

1349
01:15:58,370 --> 01:16:00,850
drive around with that convertible.
It's the one I like crazy.

1350
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:05,130
Joe Rogan told me it's all right.
It's painted whatever fucking color.

1351
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:09,310
You're like a bubble machine. I've
gotten out of it. Could Joe Rogan.

1352
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:12,610
It's a inside of it.
It's constantly blowing bubbles.

1353
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:14,993
Little sound.

1354
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:20,200
Todd glass ladies and
gentleman pulled up to his spot

1355
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:25,360
when Todd told me, you know,
this is you going when?

1356
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:29,410
When Todd told me he, I appreciate car.
I thought he meant like an old Porsche.

1357
01:16:29,411 --> 01:16:32,650
I didn't know he's going to get that.
He's blaming me. I mean, yes technically,

1358
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:35,800
but Dune buggy with a
full roll cage I wanted,

1359
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:38,410
I was so jealous in my neighborhood
when someone had a dune buggy.

1360
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:41,560
This guy's got a dune buggy. The bottom
of the ocean. Is that what this is?

1361
01:16:41,561 --> 01:16:46,561
Beetle a beetle cage car where they can
drive around on the bottom of the ocean.

1362
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:51,220
Oh, that's hilarious. Cade says
sharkskin kidding. That's incredible.

1363
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:55,350
Oh my God. What a genius idea would have
a little shark swims in their bites.

1364
01:16:55,351 --> 01:16:58,600
You right in the Dick and is playing
a holes and that fucking thing.

1365
01:16:58,601 --> 01:17:03,070
They're crazy. Yeah, there I wouldn't
need weapons and Kevlar. What do you do?

1366
01:17:03,071 --> 01:17:05,950
I have, I've, you know,

1367
01:17:05,951 --> 01:17:08,620
the whole seaworld thing that's
going on that hate it. Have you,

1368
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,370
I hate the idea.

1369
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:14,360
I've spent too much time paying attention
to killer whales and dolphins and

1370
01:17:14,361 --> 01:17:19,100
reading about them. I hate it. Let me ask
you a question. It's Pr, it's slavery.

1371
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:22,380
It's slavery to an alien animal
that we don't understand.

1372
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:26,340
What do you do with people
that like if they can look,

1373
01:17:26,341 --> 01:17:29,610
there's some things I do that make me
hypocritical and I'm asking you to help me

1374
01:17:29,611 --> 01:17:31,530
fight the fight. What do you do with
this? Because you know someone would go,

1375
01:17:31,531 --> 01:17:36,240
what about, so I agree with the, I agree
100% it's like no, come on. Like, well,

1376
01:17:36,241 --> 01:17:39,300
the way we will treat them as the way we
treat each other, it's more than that.

1377
01:17:39,301 --> 01:17:42,720
Even if it's just not that it
has to do with it, but it does.

1378
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:46,710
Even if it ended right there and that
animal's pain and it didn't affect the way

1379
01:17:46,711 --> 01:17:49,500
those humans that can do that, treat
other people on that alone. It's wrong.

1380
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:53,910
But don't think your for a second that
that's not also if you have the ability

1381
01:17:53,911 --> 01:17:56,460
to do that, you're not bringing
home a good energy to your kids.

1382
01:17:56,730 --> 01:17:59,370
Those people that fucking do that,
they go home to children,

1383
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:04,440
they pass that there's something vial
and unaware of a human thing to slug it

1384
01:18:04,441 --> 01:18:07,620
in. Now what do I do with people that
go, you eat meat and that's the way it's

1385
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,350
what I've set up till now is this.
I go,

1386
01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:14,520
I don't want to be a smoker that
smokes and because I can't quit,

1387
01:18:14,521 --> 01:18:16,880
I want to be the smoker. I was, I
used to smoke and while I smoked it,

1388
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:19,290
but this is such this, I knew
it was violent, disgusting.

1389
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:21,480
I didn't think why don't
have the ability to quit.

1390
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:24,800
So I'll make pretend to give a
public outward thing of going, ah,

1391
01:18:24,810 --> 01:18:27,630
you know you're going to have, you can,
you can eat a candy bar to not, you know,

1392
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:30,210
you know there's people that write
it off because they can't quit.

1393
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:33,390
I just called the vial and that
led to me quitting one day. Right?

1394
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:36,780
So I want to do the same thing with the
meat just because I'm lazy or whatever

1395
01:18:36,781 --> 01:18:37,614
it is right now,

1396
01:18:37,650 --> 01:18:41,430
and I might be partaking in some of that
slaughtering the way I eat every day.

1397
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:45,780
It doesn't negate that I know it's wrong.
And Sea world thing like come on.

1398
01:18:46,350 --> 01:18:49,770
How can someone think that's okay with
Joe and some of your listeners, you know,

1399
01:18:49,771 --> 01:18:52,920
might disagree with us. Just like
the seaworld thing. You just,

1400
01:18:52,921 --> 01:18:55,350
when you hear the facts and
the size and you get it,

1401
01:18:55,351 --> 01:18:58,800
it's a bath tub and that they take,
so take away from his family and all that.

1402
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:00,600
What listening person right now,

1403
01:19:00,601 --> 01:19:04,590
and I mean that wholeheartedly is
sitting home going, oh, it's seaworld.

1404
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:07,110
Come on now.
You're being ridiculous.

1405
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:08,540
Worse than prison.
Okay.

1406
01:19:08,541 --> 01:19:12,080
Because it's being imprisoned
by an alien species present.

1407
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:14,110
At least you could talk to the guards.
It's,

1408
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:17,870
it's an insane relationship that they
have those killer whales have with those

1409
01:19:17,871 --> 01:19:21,080
trainers and it's, it's
atrocious. The idea is insane.

1410
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:23,120
They are incredibly intelligent.

1411
01:19:23,121 --> 01:19:25,850
They have a very complex
language that we can't decipher.

1412
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:30,380
They have different accents for different
regions. They recognize each other.

1413
01:19:30,381 --> 01:19:33,080
They have very tight knit colonies.
He stayed together forever.

1414
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:36,050
We just can't appreciate the
way they live their life.

1415
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:41,180
But their world is a magical wonderland
where they're the top dog of the sea.

1416
01:19:41,330 --> 01:19:46,130
They kill sharks, man. They got their name
killer whale because they kill whales,

1417
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:49,340
they kill small whales.
They'll go up to like a a humpback whale,

1418
01:19:49,341 --> 01:19:51,200
have a child and they'll tear it apart is,

1419
01:19:51,201 --> 01:19:53,700
I watched a horrible video of
it the other day with these,

1420
01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:57,170
I mean we like to think of Orcas as
being these like really sweet things that

1421
01:19:57,171 --> 01:20:00,830
jumped for fish. They're
murderous machines when
they're out there in the wild.

1422
01:20:00,831 --> 01:20:03,950
They killed dolphins on a regular basis.
But for them,

1423
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:06,260
that's the spoils of the real world.

1424
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:09,690
That's how they to the top of the
food chain by being these ruthless

1425
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:14,250
superintelligent motherfuckers that
live in this playground of the ocean and

1426
01:20:14,251 --> 01:20:14,610
they cheat,

1427
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:19,410
they migrate up and down the coast
and they've done so for thousands and

1428
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:23,280
thousands of years until this
fucking tiny blip in time.

1429
01:20:23,550 --> 01:20:25,230
This industrialized age,

1430
01:20:25,231 --> 01:20:29,160
this age of aquariums is age where they
figured out how to capture those fucking

1431
01:20:29,161 --> 01:20:31,680
things. And stuff them into
fucking swimming pools.

1432
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:36,720
It is slavery.
It should be highly illegal.

1433
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:40,200
The people that want to do it, it
should. It should without a doubt.

1434
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:44,040
They should tax them out of fucking
business. There should be no way.

1435
01:20:44,041 --> 01:20:48,300
You should be able to profit off
taking a thing and making it do tricks.

1436
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:51,960
And when you find out how they train
them and you hear the things they do,

1437
01:20:51,961 --> 01:20:54,750
they isolate them and put them
in small tanks they put there.

1438
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:57,780
It's way crazier than putting a
person in solitary confinement.

1439
01:20:57,870 --> 01:21:01,650
They have them all stuffed together
physically. They can't fucking move.

1440
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:05,700
They wind up biting each other
and aggravation. It's slavery.

1441
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:10,740
It's just slavery of a nonhuman,
but equal level intelligence.

1442
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:13,440
We have this idea that just because
they can't alter their environment with

1443
01:21:13,441 --> 01:21:17,640
their fingers, that they're not super
intelligent, but that's our own biases.

1444
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:19,590
They're insanely intelligent.
In fact,

1445
01:21:19,591 --> 01:21:23,880
their cerebral cortex is something like
40% larger than a human beings that we

1446
01:21:23,881 --> 01:21:26,730
don't know what the fuck they're going,
what's going on in their mind,

1447
01:21:26,731 --> 01:21:31,020
but they're absolutely aware that what
we're doing to them is not what they want.

1448
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:34,780
They want to be fucking free and
just because he charged money say,

1449
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:36,030
well it's going to go to conservation.

1450
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:38,820
You know what else would go
to conservation awareness?

1451
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,080
Let people know what a magical
animals and the people will donate.

1452
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:42,491
By the way,

1453
01:21:42,491 --> 01:21:46,240
whenever I hear more on podcast where
we'll ask those type of questions, I go,

1454
01:21:46,270 --> 01:21:49,210
who? I always go if I had a show and
people go, you do have a show. I go, yeah,

1455
01:21:49,211 --> 01:21:51,550
but I mean it got near the people
that I want to ask the questions.

1456
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:55,660
How come nobody has told them yet?
And better way than I could tell as this,

1457
01:21:55,690 --> 01:21:58,090
but no one I've never asked.
So one interviewer,

1458
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:00,550
when they're interviewing these people
that say, well we give a lot of money,

1459
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:05,350
would you be able to molest a group of
children but then give $7 million a year

1460
01:22:05,351 --> 01:22:08,320
to the cause of molestation to,
cause it's not a race it no,

1461
01:22:08,321 --> 01:22:11,410
it's like they actually through such as
like doctor Phil calls a paper argument.

1462
01:22:11,411 --> 01:22:14,500
Like you're, you're making an
argument that's not really being had.

1463
01:22:14,501 --> 01:22:18,220
Like you're trying to act like the
argument is why do you give money to,

1464
01:22:18,770 --> 01:22:20,330
that's the argument also for hunting.

1465
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:23,990
You know the argument for hunting is that
when you hunt you the hunters pay for

1466
01:22:23,991 --> 01:22:26,630
tags and those tags pay for conservation.

1467
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:30,540
And in fact hunters do like better.
They,

1468
01:22:30,550 --> 01:22:34,850
there's more money that
comes to conservation for
preserving animals that come

1469
01:22:34,851 --> 01:22:38,420
from hunting than I think almost any
other source is hunting bad. No, no.

1470
01:22:38,450 --> 01:22:40,910
Not only is it not bad, it's important,
right. That's what I thought.

1471
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:42,320
That's what I miss the levels of the car.

1472
01:22:42,650 --> 01:22:45,800
If you've ever been on a road and
like Wisconsin or some shit like that,

1473
01:22:45,801 --> 01:22:49,610
like late at night, you have to manage
that. Like people are gonna die.

1474
01:22:49,850 --> 01:22:52,670
Like unless you introduced
predators into the environment,

1475
01:22:52,671 --> 01:22:55,730
unless you introduce wolves, which
is equally dangerous, you know,

1476
01:22:55,731 --> 01:22:57,410
and we're starting to
see the results of that.

1477
01:22:57,470 --> 01:22:59,510
There's people that are
getting attacked by wolves.

1478
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:02,870
A guy was a hunting with his friend and
they had a fight off the fucking wolf

1479
01:23:02,871 --> 01:23:07,871
pack is really recently and there they
were trying to fight over an elk carcass

1480
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:12,760
and it becomes a real issue and they
dominate areas and they don't take kindly

1481
01:23:12,761 --> 01:23:16,900
to some new hunter coming in. There's
a video I put up on Twitter. Um,

1482
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:20,920
guy runs into wolves while elk hunting.
I put it up a while ago.

1483
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:25,510
Just look up on Youtube, uh, ran
into wolves while l cog, elk hunting.

1484
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:28,540
And there's this, I'm always
fucking crazy video. These dudes,

1485
01:23:28,930 --> 01:23:32,620
elk hunting in these wolves are around
them circling them how old and shit.

1486
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:36,850
It's fucking eerie. And they're
like, oh shit. But they have guns.

1487
01:23:36,851 --> 01:23:40,900
They're not freaking out too much, but
they're like, oh shit, this is crazy.

1488
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:43,600
Like the wolves, like following
them, looking around at them.

1489
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:46,360
Like they would here one over there and
then would one would run through the

1490
01:23:46,361 --> 01:23:51,190
woods in front of them. It was
really fucking weird. Uh, coyotes,

1491
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:53,800
uh, that's what we see in
Los Angeles. Or is it wolf?

1492
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:59,050
When I see a coyote on my street, if it,
if it, if it's anywhere near my house,

1493
01:23:59,051 --> 01:24:02,350
like especially in front of my house,
uh, I will rather, if I had the money,

1494
01:24:02,351 --> 01:24:05,380
I would go check into a hotel because
I'm always afraid when I get out of the

1495
01:24:05,381 --> 01:24:08,890
car, they're going to be lurking out of
every tree around my house. So it's like,

1496
01:24:08,891 --> 01:24:13,891
I just pictured that I get creeped and I
though I bolt from my house to my front

1497
01:24:14,141 --> 01:24:17,770
door. You should, they give me the
boat. I just got bitten Colorado.

1498
01:24:17,771 --> 01:24:19,930
A guy got attacked by
coyotes at a bus stop.

1499
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:24,730
I liked the [inaudible] wolf hunting
surrounded by wolves with a bow. That's a,

1500
01:24:24,731 --> 01:24:29,140
this is the, it's the first one. You
know, I see this Brian w w wolf hunting.

1501
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:33,440
Yeah. Listen to the fucking sounds.
These things are making these guys, uh,

1502
01:24:33,441 --> 01:24:38,290
we're out there hunting and the wolves
started circling them and finding out

1503
01:24:38,291 --> 01:24:41,710
where they were and like communicating
with each other. They like,

1504
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:45,460
one of them would pop out and they were
like staring at the dude's and then they

1505
01:24:45,461 --> 01:24:47,860
would go back into the forest and
another one will come from a different

1506
01:24:47,861 --> 01:24:52,120
direction. They're all making these crazy
noises, man. It's really fucking bad ass.

1507
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:53,530
They're hungry enough, right? Oh,

1508
01:24:53,531 --> 01:24:56,680
they'll kill you for sure if they
think they get away with it, but they,

1509
01:24:56,681 --> 01:24:59,770
they're very aware of these dudes. And so
they're, they're letting these dudes, no,

1510
01:25:01,230 --> 01:25:03,960
first one was white. It wasn't,
but they have their guns.

1511
01:25:04,150 --> 01:25:07,780
How about now? They have bows and arrows.
How different are they from the sketchy?

1512
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:12,610
Dangerous. Jody's much, much, much
bigger. Much bigger. Much stronger.

1513
01:25:12,611 --> 01:25:14,320
Much scarier.
Much smarter.

1514
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:19,450
They eat coyotes all the time. Like
goldfish. No, no, no, no, no, no.

1515
01:25:19,451 --> 01:25:21,860
Coyotes are sneaky Fox man.
They're very sneaky.

1516
01:25:21,861 --> 01:25:24,610
And they figured out how to
get over over fences and shit.

1517
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:28,150
Coyotes figure out a lot of ways to, uh,
to get into your, they get into my yard,

1518
01:25:28,151 --> 01:25:32,200
man. They got it into my yard. And I have
a, I have a high plans at the big one.

1519
01:25:32,770 --> 01:25:36,340
Yeah. So he's a blowing an elk horn
to try to get them to come over.

1520
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:39,430
And that might've been what they
responded to in the first place.

1521
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:42,400
They blow these horns, that sounds,
they have two different ones.

1522
01:25:42,401 --> 01:25:44,980
One of them that sounds like a male elk,
which is kind of scary.

1523
01:25:45,150 --> 01:25:47,350
And another one that sounds
like a female or a baby.

1524
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:49,060
And that's what brings the wolves around.

1525
01:25:49,610 --> 01:25:50,443
Sure.

1526
01:25:52,850 --> 01:25:54,860
These guys are going to soon
have wolves around them.

1527
01:25:54,890 --> 01:25:57,590
They have holes around him right now
or they do it. They're making these,

1528
01:25:57,591 --> 01:25:57,981
there's still,

1529
01:25:57,981 --> 01:26:00,890
these fucking assholes are still making
these calls cause their elk hunting,

1530
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:02,150
they're looking to get an elk,

1531
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:04,940
but they're not going to get elk right
now because there's wolves everywhere.

1532
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:08,420
There's a thing going on right now
in part of the country where they've

1533
01:26:08,421 --> 01:26:12,890
reintroduced wolves because the
wolf population had been decimated.

1534
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:17,600
So they reintroduced walls button. They
used a larger Canadian wolf to like, uh,

1535
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:22,310
you know, that's like using
Germans instead of pygmies.

1536
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:26,570
You know what I mean? Like their bosses,
wolves. But one of them's mother fucker.

1537
01:26:26,630 --> 01:26:29,300
That gets to be about 200 pounds.
And so these things,

1538
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:32,990
these big ass wolves have been
decimating these elk populations.

1539
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:35,990
So that's your options. If
hunting, if you don't want hunting,

1540
01:26:35,991 --> 01:26:39,680
you have to bring in wolves. I'd say
we're probably safer with the hunting.

1541
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:41,210
No, I always knew. Matter of fact,

1542
01:26:41,211 --> 01:26:43,820
I was surprised because I always
thought I couldn't hunt myself,

1543
01:26:43,821 --> 01:26:44,501
but I always knew that,

1544
01:26:44,501 --> 01:26:48,080
that I had thought that that was
always a good way to like that's a,

1545
01:26:48,290 --> 01:26:52,070
that's an honest and animal has a life.
It doesn't suffer. I know I couldn't.

1546
01:26:52,130 --> 01:26:52,881
They get killed.

1547
01:26:52,881 --> 01:26:56,060
But you're talking about in the
plants where an animal is whole life,

1548
01:26:56,061 --> 01:26:57,980
the dates killed is
the best day it's life.

1549
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:01,070
And not only that, the, yeah,
the life is absolutely, you know,

1550
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:03,380
absolutely wild as nature intended,

1551
01:27:03,410 --> 01:27:06,170
nothing changes until that one
moment you get shot. Right.

1552
01:27:06,171 --> 01:27:08,570
So it is the freest of
free range possible.

1553
01:27:08,571 --> 01:27:10,580
And a lot of times they've
never even seen a person before.

1554
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:13,750
And a lot of times also you're
dealing with environments. Especially,

1555
01:27:13,790 --> 01:27:17,240
I went hunting in Montana and they
lose a giant amount every year.

1556
01:27:17,241 --> 01:27:19,820
Just they freeze to death,
they get killed by predators.

1557
01:27:19,821 --> 01:27:22,550
They freeze to death or they
get lame and if they get lame,

1558
01:27:22,551 --> 01:27:23,780
that get killed by predators.

1559
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:26,270
I mean there's a lot of
different predators in that area.

1560
01:27:26,271 --> 01:27:30,410
And we found mountain line shit and it
was a log of mountain line shit and was

1561
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:34,760
filled with hair. So it was a deer hair.
So they, that's how they get that go.

1562
01:27:34,761 --> 01:27:37,100
They use the freeze to death of
the killed by mountain lions.

1563
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:40,940
They're not gonna make it. No one makes
it, no one, no deer die of old age.

1564
01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:44,930
It doesn't happen. It doesn't exist. So
it's just a matter of who kills them,

1565
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:47,480
whether it's a Predator
or whether it's a human.

1566
01:27:47,481 --> 01:27:50,090
This fucking thing is dying
computers in a horrible way.

1567
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:52,500
Do you know what?
I didn't realize what you just said until,

1568
01:27:52,501 --> 01:27:55,230
I don't remember what year it was,
but it was in my adult life.

1569
01:27:55,590 --> 01:27:59,360
Like I always had this
visualize, visualize an animal,
a certain age, you know,

1570
01:27:59,370 --> 01:28:03,930
they grow. Go what you just said, I
sorta realized once and I went, oh,

1571
01:28:03,931 --> 01:28:08,590
they didn't do any. I mean
statistically do any, no,

1572
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,320
it makes it makes you maybe
elephants the so just,

1573
01:28:13,321 --> 01:28:15,720
and I don't know if you know the, you
know, just get me in the right area.

1574
01:28:15,721 --> 01:28:19,170
I'll be happy. Like, so let's
say you're a, I want to,

1575
01:28:19,171 --> 01:28:21,960
I don't want to pick an animal too far up.
How long's the deer live?

1576
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:26,070
Oh, if it's lucky, it gets five years
then it's got to be really lucky though.

1577
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:30,390
Oh really? Lucky. Super Lucky. And
then as it gets like six and seven,

1578
01:28:30,391 --> 01:28:32,820
they get old and haggard and
then something takes him out.

1579
01:28:32,970 --> 01:28:35,580
Either they break a leg, hop a
fence, and they freeze to death.

1580
01:28:35,581 --> 01:28:37,680
That happens all the time.
All the time.

1581
01:28:37,710 --> 01:28:40,230
Especially northern areas
or predators get them.

1582
01:28:40,231 --> 01:28:42,840
If they break a leg in California,
they're not going to freeze to death.

1583
01:28:42,841 --> 01:28:43,560
But you know,

1584
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:46,530
they'll probably get killed by something
that comes along and finds them.

1585
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:50,580
You know how they say, if it's Cliche,
it's true. Nature can be cruel.

1586
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:53,280
As you're talking, as
you're talking, I'm like,

1587
01:28:53,281 --> 01:28:55,770
half of this I'd never even would
think of, I was like, forgot about the,

1588
01:28:55,950 --> 01:28:59,880
they get old, they fall over. It's
like nature can be fucking cruel. Well,

1589
01:28:59,881 --> 01:29:02,370
not only that,
there's also amount of limited

1590
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:03,990
food supply depending upon the area.

1591
01:29:03,991 --> 01:29:08,210
That's one of the things that
conservationists do best. Um, and uh,

1592
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:13,080
including these, um, game wardens
and other, the fish and game,

1593
01:29:13,230 --> 01:29:16,380
they figure out how much land there is,
how much food there is,

1594
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:19,230
how many animals can be sustained,
and then what is the population?

1595
01:29:19,231 --> 01:29:22,440
And then they release tags
based on those estimates.

1596
01:29:22,441 --> 01:29:27,441
So it's the whole idea behind
it is managing populations
and they pull the pull

1597
01:29:27,601 --> 01:29:30,770
hunting back if there's any sort
of a problem, if there's any,

1598
01:29:30,771 --> 01:29:34,730
if the species are being extinct.
In fact, like big horn sheep, um,

1599
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:37,180
when we were in Montana,
these fucking things are everywhere.

1600
01:29:37,550 --> 01:29:41,070
Everywhere you went hunting for deer.
But when we were there,

1601
01:29:41,071 --> 01:29:42,780
we saw more sheep than we saw deer.

1602
01:29:42,781 --> 01:29:46,290
But it's really hard to get a sheep tag
to kill a sheep even though there's a

1603
01:29:46,291 --> 01:29:49,830
lot of them because they're trying to
build up the population because they were

1604
01:29:50,130 --> 01:29:53,000
decimated at one point in time.
There was also, um, there's,

1605
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:57,480
there's wolves there as well. Montana
wolves. There's, see there's coyotes,

1606
01:29:57,510 --> 01:30:00,120
there's mountain lions,
there's plenty of predators out there.

1607
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:03,990
So they didn't necessarily need humans
to take care of this population.

1608
01:30:03,991 --> 01:30:07,380
They want to build it up to a substantial
size. You see that in Nevada as well.

1609
01:30:07,490 --> 01:30:09,900
What, what's the most amount?
Sounds like a weird question,

1610
01:30:09,901 --> 01:30:12,330
but what's the most amount
of animals you've, you know,

1611
01:30:12,331 --> 01:30:16,380
I mean like what you could say 50 or
a hundred running together in nature?

1612
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:20,760
No Elk. You can see hundreds.
Have you? No, I've never seen it.

1613
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:25,440
But in Colorado there's a town called
evergreen and we were visiting and there's

1614
01:30:25,441 --> 01:30:28,920
this area of evergreen is where this
main street is. And they have a photo,

1615
01:30:28,950 --> 01:30:32,490
I think it's on their web street, their
website. What's the most you've ever seen?

1616
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:36,840
Uh, I, I've seen several
like deer together,

1617
01:30:36,841 --> 01:30:40,440
like four and five deer together.
I think probably the most I've ever seen.

1618
01:30:40,650 --> 01:30:41,640
I've seen,
um,

1619
01:30:42,210 --> 01:30:46,440
many times I've seen a moose
I've seen from five moose total,

1620
01:30:47,170 --> 01:30:51,430
you know, but not more than two
together. I've never seen a moose. Yeah,

1621
01:30:51,460 --> 01:30:54,870
I'm talking about it the other night
and we were saying, I swear to God,

1622
01:30:54,871 --> 01:30:57,360
we were what we were talking
about the Moose, how we, we,

1623
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:00,180
we thinking are we thinking
of the cartoon Moose?

1624
01:31:00,190 --> 01:31:03,480
Are we actually thinking of the
Real Mousse? And we decided that no,

1625
01:31:03,481 --> 01:31:07,920
even the real loose, it's got some
crazy characters. Yeah. Like the,

1626
01:31:07,921 --> 01:31:10,100
you know what I mean? Obviously
they amplify it, but even the route,

1627
01:31:10,101 --> 01:31:11,790
so we pulled one up online.
I was like, Oh yeah,

1628
01:31:11,791 --> 01:31:14,490
that looks like something that shouldn't
be real. That's what I thought.

1629
01:31:14,710 --> 01:31:18,630
But someone told me that the nose, the
length of the nose. Did you tell me this?

1630
01:31:18,690 --> 01:31:21,870
No, the length of the
nose is, uh, because it,

1631
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:26,130
it warms the air up before it gets to
the brain because you're dealing with

1632
01:31:26,131 --> 01:31:27,990
something that's so fucking cold.

1633
01:31:27,991 --> 01:31:31,950
The air is so fucking cold that
they have to have this long. No.

1634
01:31:31,951 --> 01:31:33,570
So as they breathe in the air,

1635
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:36,960
it gets heated up slowly along the way
before it gets to their head because

1636
01:31:36,961 --> 01:31:39,480
they're dealing with like 50 below
zero weather. They don't hibernate.

1637
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:43,770
I forgot about that. We're doing moose
where they ask, they're living in Alaska.

1638
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:47,890
No, they live in Montana too. In
Colorado. Uh, where I was, uh, someone,

1639
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:50,890
someone had moose droppings that
they had discovered. So they,

1640
01:31:50,891 --> 01:31:53,940
they get into Colorado.
There's this moose in several states,

1641
01:31:53,941 --> 01:31:57,270
but in Alaska they're really plentiful.
I wonder if, because you know, I mean,

1642
01:31:57,271 --> 01:32:00,520
keep in mind like, you know that lot
of people aren't that bright, you know,

1643
01:32:00,521 --> 01:32:04,190
a lot are, but some aren't. So these are
the ones I'm talking about. Like how many,

1644
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:05,870
I don't want. If Moose
killings, when people,

1645
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:08,830
people would see them would be higher
than other animals because dumb people go,

1646
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:11,470
oh, it's a moose and not getting,
it's a row. She's animal.

1647
01:32:11,770 --> 01:32:13,740
Would people ever get to be near Mousses?
Yeah.

1648
01:32:13,810 --> 01:32:17,710
People die in Moose attacks all the time.
Is that true? Oh, so maybe I'm right.

1649
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:21,580
Someone died recently in
Anchorage on the school campus.

1650
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:24,070
I think a moose got in
and killed somebody.

1651
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:27,070
They panic and they'll stomp you to
death if they're with their baby.

1652
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:30,940
All I'm thinking of is the happy Moose
and I can't imagine them in a fit of rage.

1653
01:32:31,210 --> 01:32:33,530
Well, twice we stumbled upon, um,

1654
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:38,250
Moose that had a child and we were super
careful about it. They're cute. Jesus,

1655
01:32:39,130 --> 01:32:43,610
the child is big, like a
fucking great Dane already.
And we know it's boring. Yeah,

1656
01:32:43,650 --> 01:32:46,380
I think the size of a great deal,
but it was, when we saw it, it was a,

1657
01:32:46,381 --> 01:32:49,910
it was obviously a baby, but it was still,
it was a big fucking animal, you know,

1658
01:32:49,950 --> 01:32:52,450
even though it was a baby,
but the mother was huge.

1659
01:32:52,630 --> 01:32:55,870
The mother was absolutely massive
and she just locked eyes with us.

1660
01:32:56,050 --> 01:32:58,300
They're pretty acclimated
to human beings and they're,

1661
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:02,080
they're pretty sure of when people
are dangerous and when they're not.

1662
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:07,110
But they also know that this occasionally
a bang sound that comes from people

1663
01:33:07,570 --> 01:33:09,730
and then one of their friends disappears.
Like they're aware.

1664
01:33:09,731 --> 01:33:13,720
They're not sure what the fuck is going
on, but there were a fucking people,

1665
01:33:13,870 --> 01:33:14,551
you know,
like if you're,

1666
01:33:14,551 --> 01:33:16,870
if you're ever in a place that has
like a lot of hunting pressure,

1667
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:21,340
the deer are super skiddish. But
when you're in boulder, Colorado,

1668
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:24,100
when you drive it around deer
just chilling on the corner,

1669
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:25,810
like as the cars are going back and forth,

1670
01:33:25,811 --> 01:33:29,500
is it 10 point buck just chilling in
the corner eating grass from cars.

1671
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:31,330
You're fucking flying
around all around them.

1672
01:33:31,510 --> 01:33:35,490
They don't give a fuck cause there's
zero pressure from hunters and they start

1673
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:38,040
you. Yeah, like they
acclimate, right, right.

1674
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,530
Boulder is crazy because I've
never seen a place like that.

1675
01:33:41,531 --> 01:33:43,900
I got out with my kids and you know,

1676
01:33:43,901 --> 01:33:46,420
I made sure that I stood in front of
them if the deer got really sketchy.

1677
01:33:46,421 --> 01:33:48,580
But usually they run away. They're
not, they don't try to be aggressive.

1678
01:33:48,581 --> 01:33:51,790
And the males especially,
except when they're looking for girls,

1679
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,170
that's when they could be dangerous
towards the winter, uh, towards the,

1680
01:33:55,171 --> 01:33:57,790
like the fall of the Rut when
they start getting really horny.

1681
01:33:57,791 --> 01:34:02,440
If you cock block a deer, they'll
fuck you up. I would, I, I'm scared.

1682
01:34:02,650 --> 01:34:04,930
You know, I'm the biggest
chicken of, and I'm not, like,

1683
01:34:04,931 --> 01:34:07,610
if I could drive in the car, I would
appreciate it. But yeah. So I'm not,

1684
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:10,840
I would be near it. I'm scared, you
know, when we should be. It's just,

1685
01:34:10,841 --> 01:34:12,700
that's a healthy
intelligence is what it is.

1686
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:15,940
Every time I see a picture
up there and I don't like it,

1687
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:19,960
it makes me paranoid of yourself. Yeah.
Okay, let's take it down. No, that's okay.

1688
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:23,260
Why don't we don't need it. It's just
a distraction. News cast or hair. Yeah.

1689
01:34:23,261 --> 01:34:25,930
We can just shut it off, right? No, I
don't, I don't know. Logo on or something.

1690
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:29,410
I don't want to freak you out. Oh,
it doesn't the audience see this? No,

1691
01:34:29,411 --> 01:34:32,560
the audience he's in no matter
what. We just don't have
to. Okay. See, there you go.

1692
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:37,510
Yeah. Now, um, what were
we just saying about the,

1693
01:34:37,511 --> 01:34:40,440
um, about the Oh yeah,
so when I go to, uh,

1694
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:43,480
you know,

1695
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:46,640
DC where there's a lot of monuments and
the squirrels are used to people. Yeah,

1696
01:34:46,710 --> 01:34:50,650
yeah. Like that. Like, if I see a
score from a distance, by the way,

1697
01:34:50,651 --> 01:34:53,830
you know there's no more squirrels in
Lake Arrowhead. What? Isn't that weird?

1698
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:58,250
What do you mean it? I almost,
when somebody said it, I
went, there's maybe less,

1699
01:34:58,260 --> 01:35:00,470
I don't know,
more squirrels and then I have somebody,

1700
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:04,010
there was something that happened about
five years ago or seven years ago with

1701
01:35:04,011 --> 01:35:06,980
some disease that was up there. West
Nile type. I think that's what it was.

1702
01:35:06,981 --> 01:35:10,220
I'm not positive, but it's
the only thing like, you know,

1703
01:35:10,221 --> 01:35:14,720
when we hear about like for me, you
know, I always just hear about, you know,

1704
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:17,000
like you just said, when they're
trying to save certain animals,

1705
01:35:17,001 --> 01:35:20,330
they cut off the hunting in certain areas
or we're trying not to kill whales or

1706
01:35:20,331 --> 01:35:22,630
you know, all that. But it was such a,

1707
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:26,780
to see an example of it to
go after I realized that I
would start noticing, I go,

1708
01:35:26,781 --> 01:35:30,860
no, their score, maybe there's
less, no squirrels. Whoa.

1709
01:35:31,110 --> 01:35:32,630
It just not exist.

1710
01:35:32,930 --> 01:35:36,530
Like that shows you like the
magnitude of like just fuck.

1711
01:35:36,531 --> 01:35:39,050
And that's what happens to other animals.
Just don't notice it.

1712
01:35:39,470 --> 01:35:43,250
Oh from a distance. They're so
cute. My mom had a squirrel,

1713
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:46,430
but she knew that when it was at a
certain age, he had to let it go.

1714
01:35:46,431 --> 01:35:47,241
She's like smart enough,

1715
01:35:47,241 --> 01:35:50,270
she's not going to be one of those people
with an animal that belongs in nature.

1716
01:35:50,450 --> 01:35:51,680
But she nursed it back to health.

1717
01:35:51,681 --> 01:35:54,710
She founded in her garage and
then she just let it on her patio,

1718
01:35:54,711 --> 01:35:59,270
but it wouldn't go anywhere and it
would just stay there. And you know, uh,

1719
01:35:59,271 --> 01:36:02,180
I forget what happened every time I've
told this story two times and each time I

1720
01:36:02,181 --> 01:36:04,970
forget what happened. But um,
she had it for a long time. Oh,

1721
01:36:04,971 --> 01:36:07,160
she gave it to a friend.
She, she couldn't,

1722
01:36:07,290 --> 01:36:10,010
it wouldn't leave her house and
she couldn't take it anymore. Wow.

1723
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:14,360
Became the Mama and then the same
thing. Yeah. And then after that,

1724
01:36:14,361 --> 01:36:16,730
I don't know what happened. I got
hit by a bus. Oh, just kidding.

1725
01:36:17,930 --> 01:36:19,070
Why would I forget that

1726
01:36:20,740 --> 01:36:23,620
friends with wild animals though
when you take them in, is that the,

1727
01:36:23,621 --> 01:36:26,380
to reintroduce him back to the wild,
the super difficult.

1728
01:36:26,450 --> 01:36:30,100
They grew up getting food for free.
Like now. They got to go look for it.

1729
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:33,280
Yeah, that's why it is. It
is. Yeah. You don't, well, I
don't know what you should do.

1730
01:36:33,340 --> 01:36:34,040
Squirrels.

1731
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:38,870
Vegans of the rodent world. Oh,
they don't eat meat. No, they nuts.

1732
01:36:38,930 --> 01:36:39,830
That's why they're so sweet.

1733
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:42,420
That's why you don't have to worry
about them like that. That's those cons.

1734
01:36:42,421 --> 01:36:46,430
Theat everything there. He fucking shit.
Elite condoms. They'll eat your deck,

1735
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:51,390
Daddy. Whatever's in front of
them. Rats are assholes to me.

1736
01:36:51,391 --> 01:36:55,700
What you just gave legitimacy.
Now look, if I see any road in,

1737
01:36:55,701 --> 01:36:57,900
I get a little freaked out,
but when I see a rat in New York City,

1738
01:36:58,110 --> 01:37:01,610
here's what I think of their belly filled
with trash they found was Phil look

1739
01:37:01,620 --> 01:37:03,710
dead rats. Oh, they lead other routes. Oh

1740
01:37:03,710 --> 01:37:05,780
fuck yeah, they will. They
will be wrapped in Encino.

1741
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:09,260
I lived in Encino and I had a rat
in my garage, a little rat problem.

1742
01:37:09,261 --> 01:37:13,280
I put my garbage in my garage before I
would put it outside. And these rats,

1743
01:37:13,310 --> 01:37:17,690
this apartment, those hills up there and
then see, no, they are infested with rats.

1744
01:37:18,110 --> 01:37:21,920
And this fucking giant rat
got killed in a trap. I mean,

1745
01:37:21,921 --> 01:37:23,120
it was fucking huge.

1746
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:27,070
It was as big as this
thermostat's thermostats about
the body of the Thermostat

1747
01:37:27,071 --> 01:37:32,000
is about 12 inches long. It was a huge
rash, rat, splat everywhere it was.

1748
01:37:32,001 --> 01:37:34,100
It got, I get it. You know,
I had a big ass rat trap,

1749
01:37:34,101 --> 01:37:35,750
but it just smashed his
head and killed him.

1750
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:39,500
But it was so big that I went
out there. I was like, whoa.

1751
01:37:39,530 --> 01:37:41,870
I was kind of freaked out. Well, I
said, I'll clean that up in the morning.

1752
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:45,620
I was a bachelor, you know, Lazy Bitch.
I shut the light off. I shut the door,

1753
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:48,530
I go to bed,
I get up in the morning and it's gone.

1754
01:37:48,590 --> 01:37:51,860
The only thing that's left is its tail.
They didn't need the tail.

1755
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:55,590
They ate everything else. They
ate the whole rat. They found out.

1756
01:37:55,591 --> 01:37:57,270
They felt that they'd frown.
I was fresh meat.

1757
01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:00,030
There was their buddy and they were
like, good, this guy was a dick anyway,

1758
01:38:00,031 --> 01:38:03,720
let's eat. And they ate them.
And that's why rats are scary.

1759
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:07,200
Rats don't even wait for you
to be cold before they eat you.

1760
01:38:07,201 --> 01:38:11,130
If you're their friend, they cannibalize
like on the Nache. It's normal.

1761
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:14,940
That's how you get bought. There's no
like stigma about why. What are you doing?

1762
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:16,650
It's just a squirrel.
Oh

1763
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:18,810
it's this girl puts at a
golf game the other day,

1764
01:38:18,820 --> 01:38:23,820
took a squirrel out of the another guy's
pants and then put in a tiger was like,

1765
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:26,750
why does the guy have a scroll
scrolling his pants? You're like,

1766
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:29,340
just get an escort. And then I
thought he was pretty nice about it.

1767
01:38:29,341 --> 01:38:31,500
But you get the fucking
squirrel of my best friends.

1768
01:38:32,180 --> 01:38:36,030
His girlfriend isn't as girlfriend
girlfriend, I think that's his girlfriend.

1769
01:38:36,780 --> 01:38:39,240
She's a scroll lover. What can
you tell? What can you say?

1770
01:38:39,930 --> 01:38:43,380
Yeah, they've exceptable rodent. You
know what I mean? You can have a pet rat.

1771
01:38:43,381 --> 01:38:47,460
Don't get me wrong. Guinea pigs are a
little sketchy, but squirrels like, oh,

1772
01:38:47,461 --> 01:38:49,470
they're free and wild. But
yeah, their joke. You did.

1773
01:38:49,471 --> 01:38:53,940
The only rodents we see in the wild, we
go, aw, he's so cute. Which one swirls.

1774
01:38:54,410 --> 01:38:56,400
We have this attitude about them.
We have this APP will chips.

1775
01:38:57,070 --> 01:39:00,070
Thank God they got their tail. She
mocks or actually even cute or adorable.

1776
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:01,120
When I was in boulder,

1777
01:39:01,121 --> 01:39:03,770
there was a lot of chipmunks out there
and we don't get the first step by that

1778
01:39:03,771 --> 01:39:06,070
either. No, we don't get into
it. And again, same thing.

1779
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:09,340
But did they eat the same thing?
Rats. Yeah. They, no, no, no, no.

1780
01:39:09,341 --> 01:39:12,730
The chipmunks are like, they're eating
nuts. Nuts. The leaves of sugar. The rats.

1781
01:39:12,731 --> 01:39:15,460
Or maybe they're just because they maybe
if they wouldn't eat so much trash,

1782
01:39:15,461 --> 01:39:16,250
we wouldn't,

1783
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:19,480
maybe we should tell them
stop eating trash and people
won't be as scared of you.

1784
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:23,760
Well, they carry diseases
too. They absolutely carry
diseases. They carry rabies.

1785
01:39:23,761 --> 01:39:26,160
It wasn't, didn't rats have something to
do with the black plague? Didn't. Yeah.

1786
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:30,430
Research that once. I don't think I could.
I know I couldn't. That's the thing.

1787
01:39:30,431 --> 01:39:33,940
I couldn't, if I, if I set a rat
trap, I could never go near it.

1788
01:39:33,941 --> 01:39:37,300
I'm like biggest chicken in the world,
but that stuff and I hate it.

1789
01:39:37,570 --> 01:39:38,680
Like I hate it.

1790
01:39:38,681 --> 01:39:43,681
Like one time I saw a bird flying to a
pool at a house I was house I was living

1791
01:39:43,841 --> 01:39:47,560
in when I first moved to
La and uh, it, it jumped,

1792
01:39:47,561 --> 01:39:50,350
it got into the water and I could have
run out and save it and like fucking

1793
01:39:50,351 --> 01:39:54,610
Clinton, it was a bird. I could have
reached in and gotten it and I couldn't.

1794
01:39:54,710 --> 01:39:58,120
So I was like, yell for somebody else.
I'm like, Hey, come on down to the pool.

1795
01:39:58,121 --> 01:40:01,840
There's the bird just flew into the pool
and the dot because it was too scared

1796
01:40:01,841 --> 01:40:05,710
shitless to go over and touch the bird.
Other people walk over at scoop it up.

1797
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:07,600
Like,
you can't hate that about,

1798
01:40:09,590 --> 01:40:12,170
you should go to what you should
volunteer for. Like a petting zoo.

1799
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:16,610
Get over that shit. Well, no, I'd
go to the petting zoo animals.

1800
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:19,560
There's so numb and you need to
hang out with like, well, he's dead.

1801
01:40:19,610 --> 01:40:20,260
I was going to say

1802
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:24,370
crocodile hunter. No, I don't want to get
back, but I liked it may not be screwed.

1803
01:40:24,710 --> 01:40:25,260
So

1804
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:28,890
listen to this, the black death,
which is the w, this is the,

1805
01:40:28,891 --> 01:40:33,891
the rat disease killed an estimated 75
to 200 million people and peeking in

1806
01:40:35,491 --> 01:40:38,790
Europe through the years.
1348 to 1350.

1807
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:42,450
Although there was several
competing theories as to the,

1808
01:40:43,790 --> 01:40:48,750
that's a lot. I ediology at
e I, T I o l. O. G y Mellon.

1809
01:40:48,780 --> 01:40:52,290
When I say that one of the black death
analysis of DNA from the victims of

1810
01:40:52,291 --> 01:40:53,680
northern and southern Europe,

1811
01:40:53,710 --> 01:40:58,240
published in 2010 and 11 indicates
that the pathogen responsible,

1812
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:02,350
blah, blah, blah, year, uh, pursuing
bacteria and blah, blah, blah, blah.

1813
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:07,300
Had somebody do a rats spread through
rats. I'm trying to figure out what,

1814
01:41:07,730 --> 01:41:12,430
Oh, here it is. Okay. It was carried from
fleas actually that lived in the rats,

1815
01:41:12,910 --> 01:41:17,910
oriental rat fleas that were living on
black rats that were regular passengers

1816
01:41:19,451 --> 01:41:23,200
on merchant ships. So it's spread
throughout the Mediterranean in Europe.

1817
01:41:23,230 --> 01:41:27,520
That's why they were so scared of rats
and black death decimated to kill.

1818
01:41:27,550 --> 01:41:32,550
Ready for this 30 to 60 60% of
Europe's total population that time.

1819
01:41:33,450 --> 01:41:35,790
So there's a reason they
have this reputation shoot,

1820
01:41:35,810 --> 01:41:37,380
some of it on a fairly though

1821
01:41:37,630 --> 01:41:40,090
percent of their total population.

1822
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:44,590
You imagine if something came along and
wiped out six out of 10 of all of us,

1823
01:41:46,150 --> 01:41:49,480
I think it should have a mean or
reputation than it does. Oh my God.

1824
01:41:49,481 --> 01:41:52,000
You know what I mean? You know
you're a rat. It's not that bad.

1825
01:41:52,001 --> 01:41:56,920
It should mean despicable. It should
be very bad. Not just [inaudible]. Yes,

1826
01:41:56,921 --> 01:42:00,930
thank you. Should not just be told
on somebody. Yeah, you right. Well,

1827
01:42:01,420 --> 01:42:03,520
I think that's like, you
know, listen to this.

1828
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:08,620
All in all the plague reduced the world
population from an estimated 450 million

1829
01:42:09,081 --> 01:42:12,290
down to 350 million in the 14th century.

1830
01:42:12,650 --> 01:42:16,670
[inaudible] this 14th century,
so 13 hundreds so it killed.

1831
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:21,890
That's insane, man. It killed
100 million people at least.

1832
01:42:22,780 --> 01:42:23,470
Okay.

1833
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:26,890
75 to 200 million people.
That's insane.

1834
01:42:27,190 --> 01:42:31,510
So hard for me to even
think about those years.

1835
01:42:32,110 --> 01:42:34,750
And apparently it lasted
forever. I mean, they,

1836
01:42:34,751 --> 01:42:36,250
they couldn't cure things back then.

1837
01:42:36,940 --> 01:42:39,880
It just would last for years and
years and years and years and years.

1838
01:42:40,030 --> 01:42:42,880
People kept dying of these horrible
fucking diseases and some people would

1839
01:42:42,881 --> 01:42:46,330
barely get through it and their main
immune systems would strengthen and some

1840
01:42:46,331 --> 01:42:48,490
people would just fucking
drop off like flies.

1841
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:50,340
Did you know the washing of the,

1842
01:42:50,430 --> 01:42:53,620
you know your hands and everything was
sort of not agreed upon by everybody.

1843
01:42:53,621 --> 01:42:55,780
At first I babies for giving birth,

1844
01:42:55,781 --> 01:42:59,320
they didn't even surgery wash their hands
and it was almost like the people that

1845
01:42:59,321 --> 01:43:01,990
wash their hands.
That's why I'm saying Joe,

1846
01:43:01,991 --> 01:43:04,870
everything leads down to the same
thing just because people didn't do it.

1847
01:43:04,871 --> 01:43:06,550
Like there's those things today.

1848
01:43:06,551 --> 01:43:09,370
Don't be on the wrong side because
every time in history it looks stupid.

1849
01:43:09,371 --> 01:43:12,720
There was a group of people to argue with
him over washing your hands. Well yeah,

1850
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:14,380
there's that thing going on today,

1851
01:43:14,381 --> 01:43:17,290
so err on the right side of it or the
story's going to be about what a moron you

1852
01:43:17,291 --> 01:43:17,510
work

1853
01:43:17,510 --> 01:43:20,820
well. This is a word, weird
denial about global warming. The,

1854
01:43:20,821 --> 01:43:25,821
to me is absolutely fascinating because
it's really one of the few arguments

1855
01:43:26,030 --> 01:43:31,030
that have anything to do with nature and
the nature of the world that have these

1856
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:34,940
ideologies attached to it.

1857
01:43:35,060 --> 01:43:39,620
Liberal ideologies and conservative
ideologies battling it out and when I hear

1858
01:43:39,621 --> 01:43:42,950
conservative people say that it hasn't
been proven that humans are responsible

1859
01:43:42,951 --> 01:43:47,951
for global warming or that it's just a
cycle of life are oftentimes I talked to

1860
01:43:48,531 --> 01:43:50,990
them about it and they
aren't even paying attention.

1861
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:53,300
The actual effects of global warming,

1862
01:43:53,301 --> 01:43:57,470
they have this vague idea of what
the impact of global warming is.

1863
01:43:57,620 --> 01:44:02,620
Their main concern is
defending conservative business
practices and conservative

1864
01:44:03,141 --> 01:44:06,740
ideologies and that's like where they
go to immediately to strengthened up the

1865
01:44:06,741 --> 01:44:10,520
gate and battle down for
argument and it's the, okay,

1866
01:44:10,521 --> 01:44:13,400
well who the fuck knows who's doing it?
Look at what's happening.

1867
01:44:13,490 --> 01:44:17,210
How much do you know about
what's happening? And that's
when you, it's minuscule.

1868
01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:20,630
These people have very little idea.
For the most part,

1869
01:44:20,631 --> 01:44:22,460
people are like really
passionate about the subject.

1870
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:25,100
I'm sure there's a few experts out
there that disagree with be right now,

1871
01:44:25,130 --> 01:44:27,980
but I'm just saying that by
Mike personal experience,

1872
01:44:27,981 --> 01:44:28,820
a lot of people that I meet,

1873
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:31,940
and I don't have an opinion on it because
I'm not a fucking climate scientist,

1874
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:35,360
but I've talked to like 25 year old
guys, you know, they're like, you know,

1875
01:44:35,361 --> 01:44:36,560
hard asses and they're like,
look,

1876
01:44:36,830 --> 01:44:40,580
fucking Earth's temperature has been
trained in for, you know, a million years.

1877
01:44:40,581 --> 01:44:43,630
It goes up and down. The dinosaurs
lived in a totally different, okay,

1878
01:44:43,790 --> 01:44:45,690
that doesn't matter.
You know what else we know then?

1879
01:44:45,710 --> 01:44:47,840
We know that used to be an ice age to do,
you know that you know,

1880
01:44:47,841 --> 01:44:50,720
that half of North America was
under like a mile high sheet of ice.

1881
01:44:51,020 --> 01:44:53,600
But what we do know is it's
happening right now for sure.

1882
01:44:53,690 --> 01:44:56,450
Well, but let me ask, and this
might be a no shit type of a thing,

1883
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:59,450
isn't the argument you would think on the,
on the people that think let's uh,

1884
01:44:59,540 --> 01:45:00,021
let's,
uh,

1885
01:45:00,021 --> 01:45:04,850
do what we need to do to do whatever we
can do isn't what you should do the same

1886
01:45:04,851 --> 01:45:07,550
whether you believe in we could
change it or whether you can't,

1887
01:45:07,580 --> 01:45:10,370
let's say you think you can't change it.
We can't fix it.

1888
01:45:11,540 --> 01:45:15,020
You would still want to respect the
planet while we're here so you can not

1889
01:45:15,021 --> 01:45:18,170
believe in it and still like I don't
understand what the argument is to not

1890
01:45:18,171 --> 01:45:21,620
acknowledge because isn't the whole
fight to like try to be more aware of how

1891
01:45:21,621 --> 01:45:23,450
much gas we use and right.

1892
01:45:23,451 --> 01:45:25,790
Isn't that the ultimate goal
to prove that it's happening?

1893
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:28,520
Does that make any sense
to me? Totally. Me.

1894
01:45:28,630 --> 01:45:32,750
I thought we were trying to prove
let's use less because look,

1895
01:45:32,751 --> 01:45:35,870
the global warming is our way of proving
it may be making people believe it.

1896
01:45:36,020 --> 01:45:39,950
So that's where I'm confused is so even
if it's not, even if we can't reverse it,

1897
01:45:40,070 --> 01:45:44,230
what's the downside of doing everything
they say to do? Does that make sense?

1898
01:45:44,580 --> 01:45:48,210
How does that businesses would have to
change some of their parameters like car

1899
01:45:48,211 --> 01:45:51,990
businesses, you know, what did they
do if they have coal burning plants,

1900
01:45:51,991 --> 01:45:52,501
what do they do?

1901
01:45:52,501 --> 01:45:56,730
Like this is what real problems in parts
of China that the pollution has gotten

1902
01:45:56,731 --> 01:46:00,930
so bad from coal burning that
they literally can't go outside.

1903
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:05,340
There was this insane video that they,
that was on TV the other day. Uh, let me,

1904
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:10,140
let me pull this up. Smog in China.
It's a, it's fucking nuts, man.

1905
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:14,220
These people are walking down the
street and they, they have their,

1906
01:46:14,250 --> 01:46:18,330
their faces covered with like masks and
stuff and they're trudging through and

1907
01:46:18,331 --> 01:46:22,350
it looks like they're in an apocalypse
movie. I mean, it's worse than the road,

1908
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:26,940
you know, the gloomy look, that mood,
the road, this gloomy, apocalyptic world.

1909
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:30,450
This is way worse than that. And people
live like, yeah, dude, it's, it's insane.

1910
01:46:30,450 --> 01:46:33,660
Like you couldn't make a movie like this
unless you added in later because you

1911
01:46:33,661 --> 01:46:36,150
couldn't expect the actors to
work in that kind of conditions.

1912
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:40,290
If you made a movie about the apocalypse.
They have to, where's this at? China?

1913
01:46:40,620 --> 01:46:44,520
Look at China live that long, right? No,
they don't. They can't live long at all.

1914
01:46:44,521 --> 01:46:46,920
It's just, it's killing them for
sure. There's no doubt about it.

1915
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:50,340
There's no doubt about it.
It's killing at a rapid pace.

1916
01:46:50,730 --> 01:46:54,180
It's probably taking decades
off their life record.

1917
01:46:54,181 --> 01:46:58,650
Smog levels shutdown. City of
Harbin, this is it. Pull it up. Uh,

1918
01:46:58,651 --> 01:47:02,410
Brian pull up smog in China and
it's the first video on, uh,

1919
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:05,880
under videos in Google.
It's fucking crazy, man.

1920
01:47:06,090 --> 01:47:08,700
You're seeing these people walked on
the street and you're like, oh my God,

1921
01:47:08,701 --> 01:47:09,421
you nutty.

1922
01:47:09,421 --> 01:47:14,421
Fucks have poisoned your city to the
point where people can't even breathe the

1923
01:47:14,941 --> 01:47:18,930
air. And it's still, everyone's tolerating
it still. Everyone needs jobs still.

1924
01:47:18,931 --> 01:47:20,070
Everyone needs to feed their kids.

1925
01:47:20,071 --> 01:47:22,830
So they just let these businesses
continue to operate the way they are.

1926
01:47:23,190 --> 01:47:25,320
Everything.
They should divide all the food.

1927
01:47:25,350 --> 01:47:29,670
Everything should be shut down for a
fucking month. Just let the air clear out.

1928
01:47:29,671 --> 01:47:32,730
Jesus, look what you're doing.
Pull up the video, Brian.

1929
01:47:32,970 --> 01:47:36,030
Look what they're fucking doing. Look
at this. Look at this Todd glass. Okay.

1930
01:47:36,031 --> 01:47:39,840
Want to remember that? I look at it. Look
behind you. Look behind you. Look behind.

1931
01:47:39,850 --> 01:47:42,480
You can see it.
This is fucking madness.

1932
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:46,650
This is a incredible,
incredible madness.

1933
01:47:47,750 --> 01:47:50,750
Well,
nine more than 20 anything above 300

1934
01:47:51,190 --> 01:47:55,150
I backed it up so that makes sense that
he's describing what's wrong with the

1935
01:47:55,240 --> 01:47:55,730
content.

1936
01:47:55,730 --> 01:47:59,960
Organization recommends daily levels of
particulate matter with a diameter of

1937
01:47:59,961 --> 01:48:04,961
2.5 micro meters to be no more than
20 anything above 300 is considered

1938
01:48:05,451 --> 01:48:09,870
dangerous levels. Around a thousand
were recorded in some parts of Harbin.

1939
01:48:10,130 --> 01:48:14,300
All schools were shut and the airport
was closed. Open. His home to sum it up

1940
01:48:14,770 --> 01:48:16,010
would have been still in your head

1941
01:48:19,430 --> 01:48:24,030
going up and Philly, California.
People don't understand that. No days,

1942
01:48:24,210 --> 01:48:26,730
snow days was the greatest thing ever.
Remember that boy?

1943
01:48:27,370 --> 01:48:31,290
98 one close.

1944
01:48:31,291 --> 01:48:35,700
We were 102 they go 103 and whenever
you were like skippy, be like,

1945
01:48:35,701 --> 01:48:38,430
shut the fuck up.
Remember you would call a number,

1946
01:48:38,610 --> 01:48:40,680
the add a number to call
for school closings.

1947
01:48:40,810 --> 01:48:43,980
I would tell you all the school closings
in a recording and they don't have that

1948
01:48:43,981 --> 01:48:45,960
shit anymore. There's
tweet it probably. Yeah,

1949
01:48:45,961 --> 01:48:49,680
I'm sure they probably send the parents
emails just on a mass email to all

1950
01:48:49,681 --> 01:48:53,460
students. That's such a great
one to think of like, Oh shit,

1951
01:48:53,461 --> 01:48:57,180
that is like another fucking snow days
are awesome. Did you hear about that?

1952
01:48:57,181 --> 01:49:02,040
I never liked school. You didn't
stay up? I see yellow bus.

1953
01:49:02,041 --> 01:49:05,400
I get a stomach ache. What?
Well, University of Iowa teacher,

1954
01:49:05,420 --> 01:49:08,040
a teacher assistant sent
out her whole entire class.

1955
01:49:08,041 --> 01:49:10,380
She was supposed to send out
like the answers to that thing,

1956
01:49:10,381 --> 01:49:15,000
but sent out pictures of her and
her boyfriend masturbating. Oopsies

1957
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:20,700
Iowa, Iowa. Woopsies so this is what
happens when you fuck around with email.

1958
01:49:20,701 --> 01:49:21,534
You don't know what you're doing.

1959
01:49:24,990 --> 01:49:28,350
Those snow days were fucking awesome
on one second. Do you think that woman,

1960
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:32,130
I know, do you think she
should get fired for that? Oh,

1961
01:49:32,930 --> 01:49:35,310
but what do you think the masses thing,
you think in that community?

1962
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:37,620
People are quick to judge.
They're hypocrites.

1963
01:49:37,621 --> 01:49:40,770
She's taking a picture of her
father didn't. So what? Yeah,

1964
01:49:40,771 --> 01:49:44,040
she is definitely an accident
and obviously she's probably,

1965
01:49:44,041 --> 01:49:46,890
I mean unless she's Cuny
love, we might be wrong. Okay.

1966
01:49:46,891 --> 01:49:48,460
We might be assuming it's an accident

1967
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:51,640
and she might be just be like
really a crazy attention person.

1968
01:49:51,641 --> 01:49:52,990
It was like this is the way
I'm gonna get attention.

1969
01:49:52,991 --> 01:49:56,060
I'm going to send him pictures of
me jerking off. That's possible.

1970
01:49:56,070 --> 01:50:00,010
To course we limit that, but that's
not, yeah, we shouldn't necessarily,

1971
01:50:00,011 --> 01:50:03,700
I think you should leave all possibilities
open up cause we don't really know

1972
01:50:03,701 --> 01:50:07,590
her. I mean we limited when we're deciding
if it's all right or not weeks. Yeah.

1973
01:50:07,700 --> 01:50:11,850
Okay. Excluding that. No, that was
her story holds true then. Yeah.

1974
01:50:11,851 --> 01:50:13,300
So of course she should keep her job.

1975
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:17,650
People are so fucking judgmental
and hypocritical. She's a woman who,

1976
01:50:17,651 --> 01:50:21,640
I mean d depending upon of course your
actual performance as a, as a teacher,

1977
01:50:21,730 --> 01:50:24,540
let's just assume she was a great teacher.
If it was a great teacher,

1978
01:50:24,550 --> 01:50:28,840
also loves playing with her pussy.
What do you give a shit? What?

1979
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:31,030
You know the parents that would
have a real problem with that.

1980
01:50:31,240 --> 01:50:33,970
You're completely unrealistic and
if she's playing with her pussy,

1981
01:50:33,971 --> 01:50:36,680
she's having fun to me. She's going to
be nicer to the student masturbating.

1982
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:39,850
So what? She feels good. It's
her pussy. She's off work.

1983
01:50:40,020 --> 01:50:41,920
You know she's not like
sitting on the desk today.

1984
01:50:41,921 --> 01:50:43,360
Kids are going to watch me jerk off.

1985
01:50:44,430 --> 01:50:49,430
Not a bill in front of them at first I
would like to have to fucking beat that

1986
01:50:49,541 --> 01:50:50,110
thing up.

1987
01:50:50,110 --> 01:50:53,230
A lot of people are more in channel and
they like to go with extra for the list.

1988
01:50:53,231 --> 01:50:55,420
I'm just telling you that one's going
to teach you this but I'm going to teach

1989
01:50:55,421 --> 01:50:58,690
you but don't tell your pants. I like
to spend my hands cause I feel dirty.

1990
01:50:58,930 --> 01:51:02,870
I want to just really beat it up
side to side tends to speed bag.

1991
01:51:03,890 --> 01:51:08,830
Just look to go onto the heart or
what are they writing things down?

1992
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:12,280
What do you think they're telling
me? If you did that, first of all,

1993
01:51:12,281 --> 01:51:16,990
this is all in the the in real life, which
will never happen. What do you think?

1994
01:51:16,991 --> 01:51:18,760
You know enough about
enough about therapy,

1995
01:51:18,761 --> 01:51:22,060
but you can get pretty fucking close to
what we kids would do if you did exactly

1996
01:51:22,061 --> 01:51:23,590
that in front of a room full of children.

1997
01:51:23,591 --> 01:51:27,460
At what point would they go and may
potentially does it with her pants on so

1998
01:51:27,461 --> 01:51:30,490
it's not as gross. When we were
imagining it, well, I wouldn't,

1999
01:51:30,491 --> 01:51:34,390
I wouldn't say pants on. I would say
no panties to skirt. The kids do.

2000
01:51:34,391 --> 01:51:37,810
Seriously not to be funny, but what
rig out? They would freak out, right?

2001
01:51:37,850 --> 01:51:41,260
They would start to cry,
cry. Girls would scream,

2002
01:51:41,290 --> 01:51:44,440
and this is not wrong that I'm even
asking, is it? Oh No, not wrong at all.

2003
01:51:44,441 --> 01:51:47,150
I don't think they'd say, you
hoard. Some girls they would say,

2004
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:51,660
well girl I grew up with would say, you
are. Oh, what age were you? 14 you know,

2005
01:51:51,670 --> 01:51:52,840
I'm talking about high school.
Yeah.

2006
01:51:52,841 --> 01:51:56,850
They would definitely know
that debts don't like that.
I brought this up. No, no,

2007
01:51:56,860 --> 01:51:59,350
no. I think it's important
that you brothers one judge.

2008
01:51:59,410 --> 01:52:02,050
The answer made me look crazy
because, no, no, no, no, no.

2009
01:52:02,051 --> 01:52:06,360
I didn't know because if it's a good
question. Okay. Nights. In fact,

2010
01:52:06,370 --> 01:52:09,430
it's an interesting, it's, it's
weird. You know what? What'd you do?

2011
01:52:09,460 --> 01:52:13,990
What would you do? You think I'd take
out masturbate? I didn't say that though,

2012
01:52:14,290 --> 01:52:15,860
but I think there might be like a,

2013
01:52:16,060 --> 01:52:20,710
a desire to get close to her if like
this has happened more than once. Okay.

2014
01:52:20,740 --> 01:52:22,480
In high schools,
more than once.

2015
01:52:22,690 --> 01:52:27,690
Some young attractive teacher has had
sex with two or more boys from school,

2016
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:34,360
either on campus, like locking the door
or take them back to her apartment.

2017
01:52:34,390 --> 01:52:37,990
It happens, it happens all the time. It
happens, I wouldn't say all the time,

2018
01:52:38,140 --> 01:52:40,540
but it happens.
It's happening several times in history.

2019
01:52:40,570 --> 01:52:42,240
Hearing about it more and more to it.

2020
01:52:42,340 --> 01:52:46,250
There's probably been half
a dozen or so that's being

2021
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:49,610
really conservative examples of this
that have made it onto the news.

2022
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:54,110
So we know that people are doing it.
You know, we, we know that we, we,

2023
01:52:54,140 --> 01:52:56,360
it's not like,
so you know,

2024
01:52:56,420 --> 01:53:00,200
to say that someone sends these naked
pictures of themselves woopsies I don't

2025
01:53:00,201 --> 01:53:00,980
know what I did.

2026
01:53:00,980 --> 01:53:04,370
Like she could be some crazy freak that
wanted to beat off in front of the class,

2027
01:53:04,610 --> 01:53:08,910
but they didn't want her to and she's
like, yes, she really did send it

2028
01:53:08,940 --> 01:53:12,090
to everyone in their class. Oh, she wanted
to do that. To not do it live but to,

2029
01:53:12,450 --> 01:53:14,780
it could have been.
I'm not excusing that

2030
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:16,810
I, yeah, I do.

2031
01:53:16,910 --> 01:53:21,080
I do not know what her motivation was
or if it was actually an accident,

2032
01:53:21,260 --> 01:53:22,640
but if it wasn't an accident,

2033
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:25,640
it is possible that there's a person
out there and not saying it's her,

2034
01:53:25,730 --> 01:53:26,900
but some person,

2035
01:53:26,901 --> 01:53:30,950
a person who's willing to fuck every
football player in her school and she's a

2036
01:53:31,130 --> 01:53:34,880
28 year old that's happened before.
If there's a person like that out there,

2037
01:53:34,910 --> 01:53:38,540
there's also a person that'll just email
her pussy out there and go woopsies.

2038
01:53:38,541 --> 01:53:41,720
Right. All my goodness. Did you
see my pussy? Did you like it?

2039
01:53:41,950 --> 01:53:43,700
What did you think about it?
I didn't mean to send it to you,

2040
01:53:43,701 --> 01:53:46,730
but now that you saw my pussy,
what'd you think by the way?

2041
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:50,750
You basically in life get one
freebie. Yeah. And then after that,

2042
01:53:50,751 --> 01:53:53,580
thank God for keeping records leave.

2043
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:56,240
I accidentally sent my
pussy to everyone again

2044
01:53:56,540 --> 01:53:58,490
the first time you're clear record.

2045
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:01,700
I think everybody gives you the benefit
of the doubt and they should because can

2046
01:54:01,701 --> 01:54:02,870
you imagine,
by the way,

2047
01:54:03,170 --> 01:54:08,170
we're only saying the 1% chance that it
happened with some cray or 3% because we

2048
01:54:08,211 --> 01:54:13,010
know 97% she's horrified. She's a decent
person that just got out. It's like fuck.

2049
01:54:13,011 --> 01:54:15,440
And then there's people that judge you
were saying we don't want to be that.

2050
01:54:15,470 --> 01:54:18,320
Exactly. We definitely will. We'll
take a break. We'll be right back.

2051
01:54:18,321 --> 01:54:20,060
Joe Rogan is my guests this afternoon.

2052
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:23,510
We'll ask him what he thinks of the new
healthcare program when we come back and

2053
01:54:23,511 --> 01:54:24,730
get into it and blah, blah, blah.

2054
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:28,000
Dead. Clarifying your point
is very important to you.

2055
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:31,390
I like that it is the one that's
not weird at all. It's thoughtful.

2056
01:54:31,570 --> 01:54:32,890
I think you're very thoughtful about it.

2057
01:54:33,150 --> 01:54:37,170
Yeah. I tried to like, uh, yeah, it's the,
it seems like I go backwards sometimes.

2058
01:54:37,410 --> 01:54:40,860
No, I mean sometimes you just
thinking about things like
you don't, you shouldn't.

2059
01:54:40,890 --> 01:54:45,450
Odd. Americ automatically have a very
fully formed opinion on certain subjects

2060
01:54:45,630 --> 01:54:48,240
everybody thinks they're supposed to.
And if you don't, you're an idiot.

2061
01:54:48,510 --> 01:54:51,060
But there's nothing wrong with
not having a fully formed opinion.

2062
01:54:51,061 --> 01:54:52,140
As long as you're honest about it.

2063
01:54:52,360 --> 01:54:54,880
I always say that I always say
the same thing. I'd go, yeah,

2064
01:54:54,881 --> 01:54:57,970
as long as you're careful to say it like
because uh, and I do, I try to go look,

2065
01:54:57,971 --> 01:55:01,510
I'm still taking in stuff cause I think
it lessens the anger if people at home

2066
01:55:01,511 --> 01:55:03,520
that really genuinely
might, no, you're wrong.

2067
01:55:03,910 --> 01:55:06,970
I feel like they always tell them be
comforted because if I get an email and

2068
01:55:06,971 --> 01:55:09,640
it's intelligent and somebody
breaks it down, you know what?

2069
01:55:09,641 --> 01:55:12,910
I think the first time I read an email
that educates me, I go holy fuck,

2070
01:55:12,940 --> 01:55:16,180
I want to do an earlier podcast cause
I want to come back on and go totally

2071
01:55:16,181 --> 01:55:19,840
didn't think about that. So knowing that
I will do that always lets me think.

2072
01:55:19,841 --> 01:55:23,260
Okay. I'm comfortable to sometimes
speak before I have formulated my, yeah.

2073
01:55:23,261 --> 01:55:23,910
Opinion.

2074
01:55:23,910 --> 01:55:25,470
Yeah.
It's important I think.

2075
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:27,840
And it's important to be honest
about what you actually know,

2076
01:55:27,841 --> 01:55:28,650
what you don't know.

2077
01:55:28,650 --> 01:55:32,040
There was one of the funny things about
this midnight in Paris movie was that,

2078
01:55:32,070 --> 01:55:34,880
um,
his wife and the movie was a,

2079
01:55:34,950 --> 01:55:38,130
there was a guy saw in the clip was
just like super intellectual guy who was

2080
01:55:38,131 --> 01:55:41,940
like, you know, judging wines and he
was a real, you know, annoying dude.

2081
01:55:42,150 --> 01:55:44,250
And throughout the,
you saw woody

2082
01:55:44,250 --> 01:55:47,130
Allen like a woody Allen's character,

2083
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:51,880
like battle with this guy about like
facts and ideas and deal with his, uh,

2084
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:56,670
by bullshitting him, you know,
so it's, I dunno, I think,

2085
01:55:57,480 --> 01:56:01,740
I think it's important to let
people know what you actually do.

2086
01:56:01,741 --> 01:56:03,780
Now this movie, it was
pathetic. It was funny,

2087
01:56:03,930 --> 01:56:06,720
but Willy Alan was always pretending
that he had facts he didn't have.

2088
01:56:06,990 --> 01:56:08,580
Oh was that like the yeah,
he,

2089
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:12,230
he would argue with this guy about some
things that he hadn't researched at all.

2090
01:56:12,390 --> 01:56:15,480
It was really fun. It was funny because
he didn't know what you get lost.

2091
01:56:15,481 --> 01:56:18,440
You're glad you come back.
Cause it's like what a great and that,

2092
01:56:18,441 --> 01:56:21,390
that movies out right now. Yes.
Well, I watched it on a plane,

2093
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:25,590
but it was 2011 movies. So you could
probably get it on a, you know,

2094
01:56:26,010 --> 01:56:29,220
probably get it on apple TV or something
like that. We've all, we've all done,

2095
01:56:29,250 --> 01:56:33,270
we've all done that. Yeah. Yeah. There,
especially when you're young bull shit,

2096
01:56:33,410 --> 01:56:35,050
your brains out,
you know,

2097
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:38,910
somebody posted on the message board
that and the pollution in Beijing,

2098
01:56:38,911 --> 01:56:43,230
it's pretty much identical to the low
Pittsburgh had in 60 years ago and posted

2099
01:56:43,231 --> 01:56:46,770
these photos. Oh, that's
crazy. But that could be fog.

2100
01:56:47,070 --> 01:56:51,780
I'm assuming it's not though. No, there's
a, there's a Jesus Christ that's real.

2101
01:56:52,160 --> 01:56:56,560
And that's in 19 what, 60 years
ago. Who uh, what's the guy's name?

2102
01:56:56,561 --> 01:57:01,500
I have vinegar taster and put
a link to an article. Wow.

2103
01:57:01,530 --> 01:57:06,090
That was, that was Pittsburgh not long
ago. Whoa, that's nuts. Oh my God.

2104
01:57:06,091 --> 01:57:10,470
Look at it on a map. That's, look
at that from the sky. That's insane.

2105
01:57:11,250 --> 01:57:14,730
Oh my God.
When you look at it from,

2106
01:57:15,330 --> 01:57:17,850
when you look at it from the top,
like from an airplane,

2107
01:57:18,030 --> 01:57:22,140
it looks like a big black cloud
or a gray cloud over the city.

2108
01:57:22,140 --> 01:57:23,490
That's bananas.

2109
01:57:25,140 --> 01:57:29,310
They cleaned it up all nice and good.
Oh my headphones. Pittsburgh or injured.

2110
01:57:30,340 --> 01:57:33,070
Is that because it's like the steel
city and they probably had shitloads of

2111
01:57:33,071 --> 01:57:35,940
steel factories and stuff like that?
Probably back when he's back. Yeah,

2112
01:57:36,240 --> 01:57:39,960
I would imagine. Yeah, I would imagine
that's a lot of what the pollution is.

2113
01:57:40,140 --> 01:57:41,850
You know,
whenever there's a bad,

2114
01:57:41,851 --> 01:57:43,860
in the past I remember in
school I would ask my teacher,

2115
01:57:43,861 --> 01:57:45,690
cause it's the only way I can visualize.

2116
01:57:45,691 --> 01:57:49,500
I had no concept of the 1300 so I would
ask her anytime we talked about an ear,

2117
01:57:49,501 --> 01:57:54,420
if there were stores, that was in my
head. That's what, and I think she,

2118
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:55,830
she was always very nice to me,

2119
01:57:55,831 --> 01:57:59,400
but I think after a while I stopped
asking you because we're their stores.

2120
01:57:59,401 --> 01:58:02,630
Then they, I wonder if they even had
locks back then. They must've right.

2121
01:58:03,090 --> 01:58:05,010
[inaudible] but what they
have, when did, okay,

2122
01:58:05,011 --> 01:58:07,200
let's find out when was
the invention of the lock.

2123
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:09,030
They used to have those keys like,
yeah,

2124
01:58:09,031 --> 01:58:11,880
let me know when you go to a hotel and
they still have the old key and you're

2125
01:58:11,881 --> 01:58:16,380
just like, really? You don't have a key
card again, that's always weird isn't it?

2126
01:58:16,830 --> 01:58:20,760
Isn't the police in
Austin, I'm thinking, okay,

2127
01:58:20,761 --> 01:58:23,820
the history of locks, I need
to know this. Okay, ready?

2128
01:58:23,821 --> 01:58:27,960
This the first serious attempt to improve
the security of the lock was made in

2129
01:58:27,961 --> 01:58:32,961
1778 the first loc was s woe ready for
this estimated to be 4,000 years ago.

2130
01:58:36,120 --> 01:58:39,240
It was a four runner to a
pin and tumbler type of lock,

2131
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:41,800
a common Egyptian lock for the time.

2132
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:47,140
That's insane. The lock work using a
large wooden bolt to secure a door,

2133
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:52,150
which had a slot with several holes in
its upper surface and the holes were

2134
01:58:52,151 --> 01:58:56,020
filled with wooden pegs that
prevented the bolt from being opened.

2135
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:59,590
So that was the first invention of the
LoC proving people that had been stealing

2136
01:58:59,591 --> 01:59:03,610
shit for years. There's no year
to go back to stealing shit.

2137
01:59:03,611 --> 01:59:05,200
Well also figuring,

2138
01:59:05,201 --> 01:59:08,770
figuring it out the need a gang of
people working on this kind of stuff.

2139
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:10,360
In order to get things happening.
You know,

2140
01:59:10,361 --> 01:59:13,570
if you're going to figure out how
to make a wheel or make a car,

2141
01:59:13,571 --> 01:59:15,070
or maybe you need a lot of mother fuckers,

2142
01:59:15,100 --> 01:59:18,100
dude who knows how to make tires
figured out how to make rubber,

2143
01:59:18,101 --> 01:59:21,210
you need to do to understand suspension
components you need to do to understand

2144
01:59:21,211 --> 01:59:24,350
the combustion engine. How do you
get that into a a card? Make It, oh,

2145
01:59:24,430 --> 01:59:25,660
we need a transmission guy.

2146
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:29,530
There's a lot of different variables
and one person's not gonna invent a car.

2147
01:59:29,980 --> 01:59:31,820
Yeah, but even when you,
yeah, that's, that's,

2148
01:59:31,860 --> 01:59:35,380
it's funny to think about like
someone I don't think about back then.

2149
01:59:35,381 --> 01:59:36,700
The process that goes into it,

2150
01:59:36,701 --> 01:59:39,970
like someone invented the wheel
because that was the forward thinker.

2151
01:59:39,971 --> 01:59:43,300
If that time, where was he writing his
stuff down? Like what year was that?

2152
01:59:43,710 --> 01:59:47,530
Does that, does that? When was
the invention of the wheel?
So did, they didn't have,

2153
01:59:48,010 --> 01:59:51,280
they couldn't have written then. By
the way, my, my history is atrocious.

2154
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:54,520
So if I ask any questions
like what? No, it's all right.

2155
01:59:55,120 --> 01:59:57,010
You're not pretending to be an expert.
We're just talking.

2156
01:59:57,100 --> 01:59:59,530
Thank you Kaitlin and time as
we all right. I don't know man.

2157
01:59:59,531 --> 02:00:01,600
That's a good question. That's
what I'm saying. I, you know,

2158
02:00:01,601 --> 02:00:05,200
I always picture the worst. Uh, for some
reason in my head though, every listener,

2159
02:00:05,230 --> 02:00:09,040
like even though I know I'm crazy, is
this, no, he's talking about the map.

2160
02:00:09,041 --> 02:00:10,570
He knows nothing about the map.

2161
02:00:12,770 --> 02:00:14,950
Well, there's images of uh, it as,

2162
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:19,960
as recently or as far back as 2,500 BC.

2163
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:23,570
That was for what? For four
wheel. The invention of the wheel.

2164
02:00:23,990 --> 02:00:27,500
The earliest well dated
depiction of a wheeled vehicle.

2165
02:00:27,501 --> 02:00:31,640
The earliest is 3,350 BC.

2166
02:00:32,120 --> 02:00:35,540
It's a clay pot that has wheels.
Okay.

2167
02:00:35,830 --> 02:00:37,390
I'm not even joking when I ask this,

2168
02:00:37,391 --> 02:00:39,400
even though you would think
the answer would be no, I bet.

2169
02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:42,430
I Bet I'd be wrong for thinking
that the guy who had whatever,

2170
02:00:42,431 --> 02:00:45,160
you got things around before that probably
thought the guy with the wheel was

2171
02:00:45,790 --> 02:00:46,623
crazy.

2172
02:00:47,630 --> 02:00:51,730
Like he didn't see it in his head or
like now it's hard to imagine someone not

2173
02:00:51,731 --> 02:00:56,200
understanding a wheel. Well, that's,
that's pretty, pretty fucking incredible.

2174
02:00:56,380 --> 02:01:00,700
One of the old one was a square and then
things like that guys like it's a star

2175
02:01:01,070 --> 02:01:04,000
dirt good. You get good traction, you
need to take a break and then you keep it.

2176
02:01:04,100 --> 02:01:05,990
That's what the Jewish stock came from.
They drove around,

2177
02:01:06,570 --> 02:01:09,880
they put it on a stick and the guy sat
down there in the middle and the flicking.

2178
02:01:10,110 --> 02:01:13,100
Okay. I pushed him. It was great
for plowing fields as well.

2179
02:01:14,300 --> 02:01:19,300
You till the soil as he drove
it was good for agriculture.

2180
02:01:19,860 --> 02:01:23,030
It drove around these stars of
David's until someone say, hey,

2181
02:01:23,031 --> 02:01:26,210
how about you just make it fucking
around man, this fucking guy.

2182
02:01:26,211 --> 02:01:29,200
He knows everything. How are we going to
plow the fields if we have realm wheels?

2183
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:32,750
They just drive around like an asshole.
Like wait, what? What are you doing?

2184
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:35,420
You're going to make roads everywhere.
Is that what you're going to do?

2185
02:01:35,930 --> 02:01:37,970
You're not gonna, you're not gonna do
anything that's going to go in the dirt.

2186
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,160
Are you going to make your own road?
How many roads

2187
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:44,420
do you think not still with that is you
think the world is going to be covered

2188
02:01:44,421 --> 02:01:45,830
with roads all over the place.

2189
02:01:46,050 --> 02:01:50,750
You could just drive your stupid fucking
car that doesn't even drive over logs.

2190
02:01:50,900 --> 02:01:53,330
There's a lot. It's everywhere. How
are you going to make roads everywhere?

2191
02:01:53,331 --> 02:01:56,710
That's a stupid invention.
That's what they probably say.

2192
02:01:56,720 --> 02:01:59,450
Get the fuck out of here with this.
There's going to be roads everywhere.

2193
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:02,870
Don't fuck Outta here. Get on your
horse and shut your fucking hole.

2194
02:02:02,990 --> 02:02:05,730
This is as good as we got bro.
It's very interesting.

2195
02:02:07,420 --> 02:02:09,080
It's really interesting.

2196
02:02:09,081 --> 02:02:12,020
Did they just take horse paths and
just kind of made them wider? No,

2197
02:02:12,021 --> 02:02:15,650
they had to fucking, they use tools.
There's a lot of times they use tools.

2198
02:02:15,770 --> 02:02:16,461
I mean you look it up.

2199
02:02:16,461 --> 02:02:19,310
So those old California roads
where you're going up the coast,

2200
02:02:19,460 --> 02:02:22,490
but you could tell they carved it
out of the, out of the row, the wall,

2201
02:02:22,670 --> 02:02:26,150
they're like carved the CARF tunnels
like in northern California especially.

2202
02:02:26,360 --> 02:02:29,300
They carved holes through the, through
the buildings, through the, uh,

2203
02:02:29,330 --> 02:02:32,300
through the rocks.
And we're talking a long time ago,

2204
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:33,980
they did that shit a long time ago.

2205
02:02:33,981 --> 02:02:37,190
They carve paths around
mountain tops 200 300 years ago.

2206
02:02:37,550 --> 02:02:40,490
They did it a long ass time ago.
They did it before there was any cars.

2207
02:02:40,730 --> 02:02:43,220
They did it when there was wagons.
They would just, they would,

2208
02:02:43,250 --> 02:02:46,770
they would grade the ground. They would
cut it and you know, smash it down,

2209
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,430
roll it with things.
They pulled things with horses.

2210
02:02:49,550 --> 02:02:54,290
They tried to get the ground is soft
and flat and straight as possible but

2211
02:02:54,291 --> 02:02:56,750
barely, and they only did it
like here's where the food is,

2212
02:02:56,870 --> 02:02:59,390
here's where we go to sleep and
this is where we got to work.

2213
02:02:59,391 --> 02:03:01,910
Let's get this and that and this and
then everybody stayed in that area.

2214
02:03:02,090 --> 02:03:03,350
He didn't go anywhere back then.

2215
02:03:03,350 --> 02:03:06,190
You didn't get in your fucking horse
and buggy and go to Arizona where taking

2216
02:03:06,200 --> 02:03:08,780
the cad, the kids are going to
go to California for the weekend.

2217
02:03:08,781 --> 02:03:11,870
You ever see those bells on the side of
the 101 I don't know if you've ever seen

2218
02:03:11,871 --> 02:03:13,190
it.
There's these bells.

2219
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:17,150
Are they just hanging on the side of
the one on one and your dad the fuck is

2220
02:03:17,151 --> 02:03:20,390
that every mile. Really?
Yeah. And it's like,

2221
02:03:20,391 --> 02:03:23,330
I always wonder what it was and that's
the actual original path that they,

2222
02:03:23,331 --> 02:03:26,240
they had dug down and
they kept the bells there.

2223
02:03:26,390 --> 02:03:28,660
And that was back when it was horse
and buggy. Horse and buggy. Yeah.

2224
02:03:28,661 --> 02:03:31,370
They made some roads with horse and Buggy,
but you know,

2225
02:03:31,520 --> 02:03:34,520
people lived on the coast. Um,
most of the time there was some,

2226
02:03:34,521 --> 02:03:37,010
some towns in the middle where somehow
or another people got there because of

2227
02:03:37,011 --> 02:03:39,470
the trains or something along those lines.

2228
02:03:39,590 --> 02:03:42,980
But when it was pre pretrained like way,
way back 17 hundreds and shit,

2229
02:03:42,990 --> 02:03:45,920
they came in boats. Let, let me ask
you this then. So like let's say this,

2230
02:03:46,340 --> 02:03:48,590
this is a, they start this
village somewhere, you know,

2231
02:03:48,830 --> 02:03:52,460
was there still a higher key
of who doesn't do as much
work as other people are

2232
02:03:52,461 --> 02:03:56,900
at that course? That's always existed.
Does, it's crazy to think so. What,

2233
02:03:56,901 --> 02:03:59,330
like the person that would stop and not,

2234
02:03:59,630 --> 02:04:01,760
maybe they get the ride the
horse or something. It'd be like,

2235
02:04:01,761 --> 02:04:02,960
it may pretend job for them.

2236
02:04:03,020 --> 02:04:06,560
I think people died off easier that way
because people didn't want to breed with

2237
02:04:06,561 --> 02:04:08,170
them. And I think it's, it's,

2238
02:04:08,171 --> 02:04:13,171
it's certainly always been a looked down
upon aspect of people's personalities,

2239
02:04:14,330 --> 02:04:18,350
but it's also super fucking common man
because a lot of lazy bitches out there

2240
02:04:18,351 --> 02:04:21,920
and there's a lot of people that don't
understand how that being lazy like that

2241
02:04:21,921 --> 02:04:23,750
is so bad for you in every way.

2242
02:04:23,750 --> 02:04:26,540
You're never going to achieve
anything you ever want to.

2243
02:04:26,730 --> 02:04:30,080
He never going to meet your expectations.
You're never going to improve.

2244
02:04:30,420 --> 02:04:34,130
He never going to like feel like a real
sense of like accomplishing things.

2245
02:04:34,131 --> 02:04:37,950
He's just lazy. He never gonna to put out,
you're never going to really go for it.

2246
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:38,990
And that's it's,

2247
02:04:38,990 --> 02:04:42,360
it's there for you to see so that you
could see how gross it looks to other

2248
02:04:42,361 --> 02:04:44,790
people. So when you meet
someone, I think, you know,

2249
02:04:44,791 --> 02:04:47,260
you meet someone who's troubled,
oftentimes the,

2250
02:04:47,340 --> 02:04:50,130
it's one of the best things that you
could see without having to go through it

2251
02:04:50,131 --> 02:04:54,090
yourself if you apply it.
Yeah. If you see what makes,

2252
02:04:54,130 --> 02:04:58,180
makes it feel weird about you? Like
I don't remember who said this. Um,

2253
02:04:58,380 --> 02:05:01,890
I think it was mark Twain or
one of those fucking guys.

2254
02:05:02,190 --> 02:05:06,000
He said a fool learns from
the mistakes that he makes.

2255
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:10,800
A wise man learns from the mistakes
of others. Yeah, I love those.

2256
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:15,120
Yeah. What does it great there? They're
great because they say so much. It's so,

2257
02:05:15,780 --> 02:05:18,120
yeah, that's a big one. And that
was one that was a great one.

2258
02:05:18,420 --> 02:05:20,670
I think it was mark Twain to me,
who the fuck knows who it was?

2259
02:05:20,700 --> 02:05:22,530
It might've been Benjamin Franklin.
Somebody great.

2260
02:05:22,550 --> 02:05:24,960
Some old bad motherfucker
[inaudible] of the long time ago.

2261
02:05:25,260 --> 02:05:27,620
Wrote shit down and so crappy paper.
Is it,

2262
02:05:27,630 --> 02:05:31,260
did you ever even think or would even
be something you'd want to think of if

2263
02:05:31,261 --> 02:05:33,810
somebody said like, you know,
what's a quote? You know,

2264
02:05:33,811 --> 02:05:37,950
you can get it to go down or they're
doing a wall of quotes and they call you

2265
02:05:37,951 --> 02:05:39,840
and you get to have one of your
quotes up there with all the,

2266
02:05:39,841 --> 02:05:43,590
I would go over a picket
never in a million. Oh, that's
right. You can't pick it.

2267
02:05:43,591 --> 02:05:45,570
Yeah, you would never, that's
like giving yourself a nickname.

2268
02:05:47,390 --> 02:05:51,380
The comedy medicine man. Hey, I got
Indian in feathers or how I go, Hey,

2269
02:05:51,430 --> 02:05:55,220
I'm here to do at Sharman ceremony.
I'm the comedy medicine man.

2270
02:05:55,730 --> 02:05:59,060
He can't nicknamed me. She was
jealous of those guys. Oh God.

2271
02:05:59,061 --> 02:06:02,600
Do something off my thing be

2272
02:06:04,520 --> 02:06:05,353
that's why I bought them.

2273
02:06:05,590 --> 02:06:07,450
Maybe there's somebody in the business.
You know what?

2274
02:06:07,480 --> 02:06:11,950
Maybe we can pick your own quotes and you
can, I want to say this one thing now.

2275
02:06:12,550 --> 02:06:17,200
I put this on my Twitter and um,
some people still keep retweeting it.

2276
02:06:17,500 --> 02:06:18,333
There's a,
um,

2277
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:22,150
a thing that somebody attributed
to me that was not my quote at all.

2278
02:06:22,151 --> 02:06:24,190
It was a quote by a drag.

2279
02:06:24,191 --> 02:06:28,890
Geraldo and I tried to tell people
like when it, when it happened, I,

2280
02:06:28,891 --> 02:06:32,860
I tweeted it, but the core, there's
like a picture of me and it says,

2281
02:06:32,861 --> 02:06:35,890
this homeless guy asked me for money the
other day and I was about to give it to

2282
02:06:35,891 --> 02:06:38,200
him. Then I thought, he's
not going to use it on drugs.

2283
02:06:38,201 --> 02:06:40,660
He's just going to use it on drugs and
alcohol. Why should I give it to him?

2284
02:06:40,870 --> 02:06:43,030
Then I realized that's what
I'm going to use it on.

2285
02:06:43,120 --> 02:06:46,270
Why am I judging this poor bastard?
That's, it's actually Greg draw though.

2286
02:06:46,290 --> 02:06:49,790
Somebody got, must've gotten him confused
with me and attributed that quote too.

2287
02:06:49,791 --> 02:06:53,200
Yeah. But that's not my quote. He was
a really, really fucking funny guy too.

2288
02:06:53,230 --> 02:06:56,290
Greg Geraldo was, uh, uh, a good dude too.

2289
02:06:56,410 --> 02:06:58,720
I knew him way back in the 1990s.

2290
02:06:58,721 --> 02:07:03,310
He was out here doing his own TV show
right next door while I was doing news

2291
02:07:03,311 --> 02:07:07,300
radio. So, you know, we were super
friendly. He's a really nice guy. Really,

2292
02:07:07,301 --> 02:07:11,730
really fucking smart guy too. That's a
great, that's a great joke too. Yeah,

2293
02:07:11,740 --> 02:07:14,650
it's fine. Well, you know, that's his
style. You know, it's totally even,

2294
02:07:14,651 --> 02:07:17,500
it sounds like, are Geraldo
joke. I didn't know him well,

2295
02:07:17,501 --> 02:07:20,160
but it's almost says more about
that type of comedian and,

2296
02:07:20,161 --> 02:07:22,990
and the good part about comedy because
I love Comedians. Yeah, me too.

2297
02:07:23,050 --> 02:07:27,300
And I love it. I love comedians and loved
comedians too. It's, it's, it's, uh, I,

2298
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:29,560
I appreciate that because it's,
it is,

2299
02:07:29,620 --> 02:07:33,400
it is something I really try to be
aware of how lucky I am to be like,

2300
02:07:33,401 --> 02:07:35,740
even though I'll complain about
some of the ones that don't, like,

2301
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:37,900
it's never a new comedians
that I complain about.

2302
02:07:37,901 --> 02:07:42,080
It's just really old bag comedians that
do have no desire to change. I'm not,

2303
02:07:42,081 --> 02:07:45,670
so that's my number one problem. It's
not, it's not a new guy that might change.

2304
02:07:45,730 --> 02:07:46,090
I don't,

2305
02:07:46,090 --> 02:07:48,850
I don't judge a new guy that acts like
another comedian cause you know what,

2306
02:07:49,150 --> 02:07:50,140
he might grow out of it.

2307
02:07:50,141 --> 02:07:52,840
I've seen comedians and emulate other
comedians and then you look at him two

2308
02:07:52,841 --> 02:07:56,470
years later you go, oh they came into
their own. I don't judge in the beginning.

2309
02:07:56,471 --> 02:08:00,490
I just root for it all. And I'm positive,
very similar to musicians to do that.

2310
02:08:00,670 --> 02:08:03,130
Really? Yeah. Because so
anyway, when I talk about that,

2311
02:08:03,131 --> 02:08:07,480
the guy that's doing it for like that, but
this all started positive. But overall,

2312
02:08:07,750 --> 02:08:12,700
I love comedians and I and and it's a
great fraternity to be a part of and most

2313
02:08:12,701 --> 02:08:16,990
of them were pretty decent, pretty
soft and pretty cool and pretty honest.

2314
02:08:16,991 --> 02:08:19,150
You know, you hang out, you
feel you feel good around them.

2315
02:08:19,230 --> 02:08:23,580
I love Dom Irrera and one of the things
I love about Domino Rera is dom I rera

2316
02:08:23,581 --> 02:08:28,020
is always working on his act always.
He truly loves comedy.

2317
02:08:28,170 --> 02:08:29,730
It's not just what he does for a living.

2318
02:08:29,940 --> 02:08:32,610
He truly loves doing comedy and
he works on it all the time.

2319
02:08:32,790 --> 02:08:36,660
He hasn't ever hit the get ups, give
up switch. Some guys just hit that,

2320
02:08:36,661 --> 02:08:39,580
give up switch and then they start
complaining and you're around them.

2321
02:08:39,610 --> 02:08:40,890
They complaining about the business.

2322
02:08:40,891 --> 02:08:43,530
The business keeps screwing guys
like me and you're like, dude,

2323
02:08:43,860 --> 02:08:45,720
I haven't heard your sat in forever.

2324
02:08:45,721 --> 02:08:47,580
I haven't seen a special
out of you and forever.

2325
02:08:47,581 --> 02:08:51,000
I haven't seen you haven't
seen a website that's out.

2326
02:08:51,001 --> 02:08:53,940
I haven't seen blogs you've written. I
haven't seen a podcasts. You've done.

2327
02:08:54,120 --> 02:08:55,710
I haven't seen a fucking
let them in appearance.

2328
02:08:55,711 --> 02:08:57,390
I haven't seen anything from you.
You stopped.

2329
02:08:57,510 --> 02:09:02,250
You stopped doing comedy and now
you're whining like shut the fuck up.

2330
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:06,870
Go and do it. And they're a
drag man. They're fucking drag.

2331
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:10,600
There's such a big difference
from complaining cause I
know someone taking this

2332
02:09:10,601 --> 02:09:12,610
out of context.
I mean including me going,

2333
02:09:12,760 --> 02:09:15,700
I love to complain about a clubs that
don't get it or when they don't set it up

2334
02:09:15,701 --> 02:09:17,980
right.
But that's not my majority.

2335
02:09:17,981 --> 02:09:21,880
I also spend a shit ton of time
talking about good and positive things.

2336
02:09:22,330 --> 02:09:23,080
But the other guys there,

2337
02:09:23,080 --> 02:09:25,270
well after a while it's hard to
be around them because you like,

2338
02:09:26,020 --> 02:09:28,900
you have to do a lot of head nodding
and you think at one point don't they

2339
02:09:28,901 --> 02:09:31,570
realize I'm not agreeing because they get
to the point where I can't agree on it.

2340
02:09:31,870 --> 02:09:34,750
You're beating, you taken a near
beat. Yeah. They just beat you down.

2341
02:09:34,790 --> 02:09:38,350
What do you just give him a little
bit of that and they accept that? Oh,

2342
02:09:38,351 --> 02:09:41,350
those guys are brutal. There was a guy
that, uh, I was friends with that I,

2343
02:09:41,360 --> 02:09:44,200
I had to stop those back in the day.
I was friends with them for a long time.

2344
02:09:44,201 --> 02:09:47,740
Like I met him in the 90s and uh,
he did not do well.

2345
02:09:47,741 --> 02:09:51,700
He moved out to Los Angeles and now
these are real insecure guy and real

2346
02:09:51,701 --> 02:09:54,270
problems with, you know,
trying to go on auditions,

2347
02:09:54,271 --> 02:09:58,120
who's trying to be a comedic actor.
I like the guy, I enjoyed him.

2348
02:09:58,150 --> 02:10:01,720
Like there was a percentage of the
time that I loved being around him.

2349
02:10:02,020 --> 02:10:05,740
I loved it when we were laughing
and joking and talking about things.

2350
02:10:05,741 --> 02:10:06,970
I loved being around him.

2351
02:10:07,210 --> 02:10:11,170
But then there was another part that was
maybe it was only 10 20% of the time.

2352
02:10:11,350 --> 02:10:16,180
It was an unbearable, it was
torture. And I tried to let him know,

2353
02:10:16,181 --> 02:10:20,050
I tried to say, lick man, you know,
I appreciate that you're struggling.

2354
02:10:20,051 --> 02:10:22,810
I pee appreciate you're out here
in California. And it, you know,

2355
02:10:22,811 --> 02:10:25,210
it's hard to make things happen,
but here's what you got, man.

2356
02:10:25,211 --> 02:10:28,690
You're a talented guy. You're a
talented guy, you're a funny guy.

2357
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:31,720
Just keep doing it and you'll
figure out how, what it is.

2358
02:10:31,721 --> 02:10:35,700
You'll find a manage you an audition,
you'll make a set that goes onto it.

2359
02:10:35,710 --> 02:10:39,170
You're going to find it the most important
things that you're enjoying yourself

2360
02:10:39,171 --> 02:10:41,660
and you're out here, you know, doing
what you love to do for a living.

2361
02:10:41,810 --> 02:10:45,740
That shit never flew with him. Why is
this fucking guy is fucking guys on TV?

2362
02:10:45,741 --> 02:10:48,320
How come this fucking guy got a
development deal? You know what man,

2363
02:10:48,410 --> 02:10:51,200
I'm turning the TV. I'm seeing this
fucking guy with a show and I'm like,

2364
02:10:51,201 --> 02:10:53,240
maybe this is not the business for
me. Me, me, I'm in the wrong business.

2365
02:10:53,241 --> 02:10:55,850
I saw that fucking guy set.
This fucking guy was terrible.

2366
02:10:55,851 --> 02:10:58,370
Let me tell you something. I mean,
he was like open mic night. Terrible.

2367
02:10:58,380 --> 02:11:00,140
I can I can I tell you,

2368
02:11:00,840 --> 02:11:03,240
I told someone who by the way,
they're not that case yet.

2369
02:11:03,530 --> 02:11:05,400
And matter of fact of the half,

2370
02:11:05,400 --> 02:11:08,840
half of my life is being afraid
of saying any names. Um, this is,

2371
02:11:08,850 --> 02:11:12,090
this isn't even a bad thing. Like this
is actually giving this person, you know,

2372
02:11:12,091 --> 02:11:16,140
credit, right? But, um,
that they were aware of it,

2373
02:11:16,141 --> 02:11:19,140
but it has to do with what you're talking
about. Uh, uh, complaining but, but not,

2374
02:11:19,141 --> 02:11:20,340
not that,
not that bad yet,

2375
02:11:20,370 --> 02:11:23,070
but it could be going down that path
and maybe I want to help a little and I

2376
02:11:23,071 --> 02:11:27,230
said, let me ask you a question.
If some celebrity offered you, um,

2377
02:11:27,300 --> 02:11:31,440
I didn't know what figure to make up.
I go $10,000 a month right now.

2378
02:11:31,700 --> 02:11:35,550
Does 10,000 a week exactly. To
write funny tweets. He, you know,

2379
02:11:35,580 --> 02:11:38,220
it's a weird make pretend thing, but I
go, they call you on the phone. He goes,

2380
02:11:38,221 --> 02:11:39,900
listen, I want to start
tweeting more and you know,

2381
02:11:39,901 --> 02:11:42,900
my voice you'll given to me at the end
of each day. I'll pick a few. I like,

2382
02:11:42,901 --> 02:11:45,960
you know, it's a, it's a
good paycheck, but it's okay.

2383
02:11:45,990 --> 02:11:47,910
I'll give you a $10,000 a week,
whatever it would,

2384
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:52,050
would you be able to do that you need?
No. No. I asked, what would you think? No,

2385
02:11:52,440 --> 02:11:56,730
go ahead. Handle. I asked him and he's, I
know he could. He goes, yeah. And I went,

2386
02:11:56,790 --> 02:12:00,540
well then write some for yourself.
Like did the,

2387
02:12:00,770 --> 02:12:04,710
why are you not that you at least
should be tweeting funny tweets now me,

2388
02:12:04,711 --> 02:12:07,140
could I do it? No, but I don't
want to get a job as a writer.

2389
02:12:07,141 --> 02:12:11,220
I don't think that's my strong point.
This person is so like, you know,

2390
02:12:11,221 --> 02:12:14,280
write some funny tweets.
I take advantage of what there is.

2391
02:12:14,460 --> 02:12:18,150
Well if you, if you just have a
couple thousand followers, okay,

2392
02:12:18,151 --> 02:12:19,860
let's say if you're a comedian,
you're struggling,

2393
02:12:19,861 --> 02:12:21,840
you've got a thousand
followers to see a thousand,

2394
02:12:22,320 --> 02:12:25,830
I guarantee you out of
those thousand people,

2395
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:28,260
if you say something that's truly funny,

2396
02:12:28,410 --> 02:12:31,560
they're going to hit that retweet
button and it might be a slow trickle.

2397
02:12:31,650 --> 02:12:32,251
Where would it be?

2398
02:12:32,251 --> 02:12:35,290
Like a few other people get it and then
a few other people get and a few people

2399
02:12:35,330 --> 02:12:38,160
steal it and they'll just fucking
copy it and throw it. That's a,

2400
02:12:38,161 --> 02:12:42,030
that's a real common thing with
non known funny people with tweets.

2401
02:12:42,420 --> 02:12:45,600
But then people get found because of that.

2402
02:12:45,630 --> 02:12:49,770
Our friend Kathleen up in
Toronto slash lean on a Twitter.

2403
02:12:50,070 --> 02:12:54,840
She's uh, w we hung out with her and uh,
Toronto, she's just a Twitter comedian.

2404
02:12:55,230 --> 02:12:58,270
And she wanted to do standup, but she
never really did it. You know, we,

2405
02:12:58,300 --> 02:13:01,440
me and Doug Benson and who the
fuck else was with us up there?

2406
02:13:02,250 --> 02:13:07,080
I think I was Callin. Hmm. Maybe. Uh,
it was in Toronto. I don't remember.

2407
02:13:07,140 --> 02:13:10,720
Was it Ari? Whatever, whatever it might
have been. Ra, whatever it was. Um,

2408
02:13:10,860 --> 02:13:13,530
she was like, she's really funny and
now she's got a development deal.

2409
02:13:13,650 --> 02:13:17,700
She's like doing a show on MTV. Right.
All from Twitter. And we know people.

2410
02:13:17,701 --> 02:13:20,610
He's supposed to say that. And that's what
to say. Anything, I don't know. Is it,

2411
02:13:20,670 --> 02:13:25,140
is it supposed to be a known
Cognito? Whoops. Oh, you don't,

2412
02:13:25,380 --> 02:13:27,390
I didn't know man. You didn't,
can't tell me Shit like that.

2413
02:13:27,391 --> 02:13:28,490
And then it's supposed to be a seat.

2414
02:13:28,690 --> 02:13:29,730
No, no. Okay.

2415
02:13:29,731 --> 02:13:33,480
Whenever it ain't no people just got
my point is got like 50,000 Twitter

2416
02:13:33,481 --> 02:13:37,020
followers or something. She's
hilarious. Yeah. Yeah. People
are going to, and again,

2417
02:13:37,200 --> 02:13:41,010
it's not me saying that about myself
because it's for a tweeting is I tweet and

2418
02:13:41,011 --> 02:13:44,280
I like it. It's not my
strong suit. But this person,

2419
02:13:44,281 --> 02:13:47,160
if you're claiming you're right or anybody
out there that says they're a writer

2420
02:13:47,490 --> 02:13:50,710
should ask themselves the same question
like, yeah, fucking, you're right.

2421
02:13:50,760 --> 02:13:54,390
It doesn't mean you have 3
million overnight, but you
will see your numbers grow.

2422
02:13:54,540 --> 02:13:57,990
And obviously we, we, like I just
said, we see a lot of these people,

2423
02:13:57,991 --> 02:14:01,410
so it's just applying what certain people
do to your friends that don't realize

2424
02:14:01,411 --> 02:14:02,970
you could do it.
Here's what she said.

2425
02:14:03,050 --> 02:14:04,860
Here's our latest tweet her,

2426
02:14:04,861 --> 02:14:08,950
her name on Twitter is
Princess Anus and she writes,

2427
02:14:09,100 --> 02:14:12,760
turned on the little heater under my desk
at work crunching numbers and cooking

2428
02:14:12,761 --> 02:14:13,594
pussy.

2429
02:14:16,420 --> 02:14:20,950
She's showing her pussy like her
pants looking down at the the heater.

2430
02:14:20,951 --> 02:14:23,620
It's right underneath her. She
lives in Toronto. It's cold as fuck.

2431
02:14:23,740 --> 02:14:28,090
Pull the picture up Brian. It's
hilarious. It's slash lien on Twitter.

2432
02:14:28,150 --> 02:14:31,000
How did you find out about this
girl? Uh, somebody tweeted her,

2433
02:14:31,250 --> 02:14:35,560
so she's got 71,000 followers now
and she's not like a famous person.

2434
02:14:36,370 --> 02:14:37,210
Look at that.
Just got it.

2435
02:14:37,211 --> 02:14:42,211
She shows a picture of her buzzy above
the heat or she's just a funny girl.

2436
02:14:42,581 --> 02:14:43,990
She says a lot of funny shit.

2437
02:14:44,960 --> 02:14:48,050
Yeah, it's good. It's, it proves that
it works. Chris Carmona he reads,

2438
02:14:48,140 --> 02:14:51,380
writes a lot of funny tweets
and people, uh, you know,

2439
02:14:51,440 --> 02:14:53,840
you just start noticing after a
while someone forwards it to you.

2440
02:14:53,950 --> 02:14:57,020
She had a great joke about blowing a guy,
um,

2441
02:14:57,070 --> 02:15:01,690
who like blowing so many drunks that
she didn't pass her, uh, her breath,

2442
02:15:01,691 --> 02:15:06,670
the test breadth detector tests cause
she had sucked the drunk guys deck.

2443
02:15:09,690 --> 02:15:11,230
It was really funny man.

2444
02:15:11,810 --> 02:15:13,850
I love it when somebody like
that, you know, I always,

2445
02:15:13,851 --> 02:15:17,150
I've said this a million times, but like
I don't mind giving jealous when people,

2446
02:15:17,450 --> 02:15:19,190
you know,
have early success in size.

2447
02:15:19,220 --> 02:15:21,140
We have to remember the people
that aren't doing it anymore.

2448
02:15:21,380 --> 02:15:24,890
But I also tried to turn the jealousy
in a motivation as opposed to like

2449
02:15:24,891 --> 02:15:27,920
bitterness, you know, just try
to like get, okay, that's cool.

2450
02:15:27,921 --> 02:15:30,020
You get a little jealous and then think,
what could I be fucking doing

2451
02:15:30,530 --> 02:15:34,030
says here, no matter what the
letters are all knuckle tattoos.

2452
02:15:34,031 --> 02:15:35,890
Say Dad's gone.

2453
02:15:38,470 --> 02:15:39,670
That's so rude.

2454
02:15:41,530 --> 02:15:44,050
Just accidentally stabbed
my face on a dick.

2455
02:15:45,100 --> 02:15:48,670
A true friend will tell you when your
yoga pants are sucking your pussy lips up

2456
02:15:48,671 --> 02:15:50,200
like a three toed sloth.

2457
02:15:53,080 --> 02:15:56,200
It's a funny fucking Twitter page
and she does it all the time.

2458
02:15:56,440 --> 02:16:00,250
If you look at it, you know every
couple of days she bangs out a good one.

2459
02:16:00,251 --> 02:16:02,650
So like her,
her like numbers,

2460
02:16:02,920 --> 02:16:04,900
like she'll like take a couple
of days off or something.

2461
02:16:04,901 --> 02:16:06,850
But the numbers that
she puts like what she,

2462
02:16:06,851 --> 02:16:09,340
whatever she puts out there
is like really high quality.

2463
02:16:09,341 --> 02:16:12,790
She doesn't have a lot of stupid tweets
like my mind is a lot of useless tweets.

2464
02:16:13,120 --> 02:16:16,180
I mean some of them are funny and some
weed everyday shit. Pretty much. Yeah.

2465
02:16:16,420 --> 02:16:17,260
If I find anything,

2466
02:16:17,261 --> 02:16:19,420
I mean I'll take days off if I
find things that are interesting.

2467
02:16:19,480 --> 02:16:23,080
I think it's my duty almost to like
retweet things I think are interesting.

2468
02:16:23,380 --> 02:16:26,830
He got like 1.5 million followers
and someone comes along and shows you

2469
02:16:26,831 --> 02:16:30,190
something that you think other people
be interested in. It's your duty to send

2470
02:16:30,190 --> 02:16:32,200
it out. Like hey check this
out. Like they're your friends.

2471
02:16:32,201 --> 02:16:34,600
Like that's what I would do with you.
That's a great way to look at it.

2472
02:16:34,850 --> 02:16:37,420
If you've got an interest,
like if sort of like modeling whatever,

2473
02:16:37,421 --> 02:16:42,310
clays fucking making sculpture, whatever
the fuck it would be, sail boating.

2474
02:16:42,460 --> 02:16:45,250
And I said, Oh Todd, like sail boating.
It's a cool article on sail boating. Boom.

2475
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:47,950
I would send it to you. If you were into
science. Boom, I would send it to you.

2476
02:16:48,240 --> 02:16:50,710
That's what you're doing on Twitter. Like
someone sends you something that makes,

2477
02:16:50,711 --> 02:16:53,740
you know, you go whoa. So you're
sending it to all your friends.

2478
02:16:53,900 --> 02:16:56,230
You know all those people on
Twitter that are your followers.

2479
02:16:56,470 --> 02:16:58,920
It's ironic that the, they're your
followers, you know, they follow the,

2480
02:16:58,921 --> 02:17:00,940
you really should probably
call him a Twitter friends.

2481
02:17:01,270 --> 02:17:03,630
That'd be like a nicer way. It
might be a little warmer. It's,

2482
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:07,820
but it's really what it is. You know?
Why are they following me? Yeah.

2483
02:17:08,050 --> 02:17:11,590
Fuck you father time and
you're not my real dad.

2484
02:17:13,370 --> 02:17:16,630
Human to hire somebody to write funny
tweets for me. Why not? Fuck it.

2485
02:17:18,160 --> 02:17:22,810
Anybody can I tell you when
they correct me on spelling,

2486
02:17:22,811 --> 02:17:23,870
I want to have a God damn.

2487
02:17:24,700 --> 02:17:25,960
I want to find the person.

2488
02:17:25,961 --> 02:17:28,810
And I don't want to do what I want to
do because I have to calm down before I

2489
02:17:28,811 --> 02:17:31,900
started doing what I want. I want to
talk to them at the end of the day,

2490
02:17:31,901 --> 02:17:35,590
but I want to go, what is wrong
with you? Seriously? Who are you?

2491
02:17:35,900 --> 02:17:38,530
That's what I want to look at. Someone
to go, who are you? You read that?

2492
02:17:38,531 --> 02:17:40,670
I'm not going to yell at you. I'm
just going to, when you read it,

2493
02:17:40,700 --> 02:17:43,630
you saw there's a spelling mistake is
really that you were motivated to fix.

2494
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:48,820
Re who are you?
Are you seriously like,

2495
02:17:48,970 --> 02:17:52,930
it sounds silly. I get it, but then
there's also like, yeah, who are they?

2496
02:17:53,410 --> 02:17:57,040
Who are you? What do you do to everyone
else in your life? If that's what you,

2497
02:17:57,100 --> 02:18:00,730
the first thing, I'm trying to be funny,
I'm a comedian. I'm not a good speller,

2498
02:18:00,850 --> 02:18:02,700
but your goal is good.

2499
02:18:04,940 --> 02:18:08,010
It was people are angry.
They're angry.

2500
02:18:08,011 --> 02:18:11,670
Todd glass life is not what they wanted
it to be. Well, let's say they said this,

2501
02:18:11,700 --> 02:18:14,910
we're trying to help.
I still go, all right.

2502
02:18:14,911 --> 02:18:16,560
Now you're just making
yourself the victim.

2503
02:18:17,220 --> 02:18:21,120
There's a lot of that that you know
what there is, there's paths, there's,

2504
02:18:21,121 --> 02:18:23,600
there's ways you manage
your life in this pass.

2505
02:18:23,610 --> 02:18:28,080
He'd go down and if you go down
that I'm a victim path by instinct,

2506
02:18:28,170 --> 02:18:32,940
by automatic reflexively. A lot of people
do. Goddamn those people are annoying.

2507
02:18:33,420 --> 02:18:37,770
Those people are so fucking annoying.
It's a real problem.

2508
02:18:37,830 --> 02:18:41,000
I tend to agree with you on most of
the things you say. You know, I'm,

2509
02:18:41,010 --> 02:18:42,870
I'm in always in a pretty
have the same area.

2510
02:18:42,871 --> 02:18:45,690
Sometimes you say it in a better way
than I say so it still helps to listen to

2511
02:18:45,691 --> 02:18:47,670
it cause I, it helps me
fight the fight. So I,

2512
02:18:47,671 --> 02:18:50,220
I think preaching to the choir as good.
I don't think it's a waste of time.

2513
02:18:50,880 --> 02:18:53,970
We're doing a fingers that move the
presales folks listening to this.

2514
02:18:54,060 --> 02:18:56,710
I think sometimes it's good to hear
it because you, it's like I said,

2515
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:00,120
it hit it from another perspective.
I'll drop an analogy I use.

2516
02:19:00,210 --> 02:19:02,880
If someone gives me a better one, I'm
like, oh, that's better. Mine's gone.

2517
02:19:03,480 --> 02:19:04,320
I love that one.

2518
02:19:04,360 --> 02:19:07,740
I think we naturally would just,
we were talking about cults earlier and,

2519
02:19:07,800 --> 02:19:12,670
and you know, people arguing
over ideologies. I think
we naturally form tribes,

2520
02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:13,391
you know,

2521
02:19:13,391 --> 02:19:17,950
and I think there's some tribes are
formed just based on behavior and belief

2522
02:19:17,951 --> 02:19:22,770
systems and geography. And we get
these weird things and very dangerous.

2523
02:19:22,930 --> 02:19:24,610
You might think,
I swear to you,

2524
02:19:24,640 --> 02:19:27,350
I think this genuinely has
to do with what we're about.

2525
02:19:27,351 --> 02:19:30,230
I'm not trying to go cheap segue.
If I am, you'll know from my gut.

2526
02:19:30,231 --> 02:19:32,090
I didn't think I was,
I believe you 100%.

2527
02:19:32,180 --> 02:19:34,830
The only thing I wrote down and I
wanted to talk to you about was, uh,

2528
02:19:34,880 --> 02:19:37,720
it's not here anymore, was the when
people, you said they will need the,

2529
02:19:37,730 --> 02:19:41,000
you said they will form tribes. People
will just say so. Okay, here we go.

2530
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:45,320
So podcasting is original, basically
taking radio and making it as, you know,

2531
02:19:45,350 --> 02:19:48,800
just getting rid of the middle
management. It's just, it's pure stand up.

2532
02:19:48,860 --> 02:19:50,780
So that's what it is.
It's getting rid of that person.

2533
02:19:51,020 --> 02:19:52,970
So there's this thing that happened by,

2534
02:19:52,971 --> 02:19:56,270
I think if you're right that people
will naturally create their own rules.

2535
02:19:56,570 --> 02:19:58,580
So we got rid of the person
that you just do what you want.

2536
02:19:58,580 --> 02:20:02,920
And then there became the was Yolie do
an hour podcast by people that did bod

2537
02:20:02,921 --> 02:20:05,360
test. They decided that and
I felt a little bit of that.

2538
02:20:05,540 --> 02:20:09,350
Now should I only do it and then you, this
is why I'm thanking you. If someone go,

2539
02:20:09,410 --> 02:20:12,830
oh no, Joe Rogan, he does a three hour
podcasts. I'm like thank fucking God.

2540
02:20:13,130 --> 02:20:16,580
Cause it was like, yeah, like I want
to do three hours, leave me to so,

2541
02:20:16,760 --> 02:20:20,360
but that whole rule was made by the,
here's this great institution,

2542
02:20:20,600 --> 02:20:24,560
get rid of all the business radio. It's a
great tool. Get rid of all the business.

2543
02:20:24,561 --> 02:20:27,110
Get rid of anyone telling you what to do.
It's just us now.

2544
02:20:27,111 --> 02:20:29,750
And someone decided to go,
yeah, you only do it as an hour.

2545
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:32,240
Here's one thing I want to put out
there too. This is really important.

2546
02:20:32,660 --> 02:20:35,720
You don't have to do commercials in the
middle. You fucking podcast. You don't,

2547
02:20:35,780 --> 02:20:38,180
I don't do it. I won't do
it. I never will do it.

2548
02:20:38,181 --> 02:20:42,040
I'm not interrupting the fucking show
because it's brutal. It's brutal. It,

2549
02:20:42,041 --> 02:20:46,010
it fucks with the conversation. It puts
a hitch in the conversation and you,

2550
02:20:46,370 --> 02:20:49,220
we've Umaine yourself
afterwards in post here,

2551
02:20:49,350 --> 02:20:51,560
but if you interrupt the conversations,
start reading off a page,

2552
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:52,970
we're starting from scratch again.

2553
02:20:53,360 --> 02:20:54,193
Certainly.

2554
02:20:54,200 --> 02:20:58,100
We've certainly heard good people that
had to do it when they had radio do it

2555
02:20:58,101 --> 02:21:00,890
and it's not the best part of it, but we
still love them. They don't have to do,

2556
02:21:00,891 --> 02:21:03,640
he knew more. Now you don't have
to do that. So I totally, yeah,

2557
02:21:04,240 --> 02:21:07,630
since you don't have to do it is because
if you are selling things that you

2558
02:21:07,631 --> 02:21:11,890
actually believe in, we have a series
of different products that we agree to,

2559
02:21:12,040 --> 02:21:14,590
but we've turned down a lot of products.
I'm like, I have no use for that.

2560
02:21:14,740 --> 02:21:16,570
I wouldn't use that in real life.
I don't agree with it.

2561
02:21:16,571 --> 02:21:18,460
I don't like what it is
that I've turned down.

2562
02:21:19,810 --> 02:21:22,390
Podcast sponsorships to promote
things that I don't believe in.

2563
02:21:22,391 --> 02:21:24,580
Movies that aren't believing
shows that I don't believe in.

2564
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,970
Once you make that sort of an agreement,
well,

2565
02:21:28,540 --> 02:21:32,110
people will support the things that
support your show automatically.

2566
02:21:32,111 --> 02:21:36,340
They would want to, if it really is a
good product. Who is that? That's me.

2567
02:21:36,341 --> 02:21:37,630
God dammit.
You see that?

2568
02:21:37,631 --> 02:21:42,631
You know what that has pitches with this
is is a Samsung Galaxy note three that

2569
02:21:43,541 --> 02:21:47,300
I'm super happy with. Oh my
goodness. How do I reject,

2570
02:21:47,860 --> 02:21:52,660
reject a call with a message?
Okay. Hmm. Sorry, I'm busy.

2571
02:21:52,661 --> 02:21:54,490
Call back later.
I just sent a message.

2572
02:21:54,660 --> 02:21:56,500
You know what? You know what
I always think of when we're,

2573
02:21:56,520 --> 02:21:58,190
when I'm having conversations like this,

2574
02:21:58,730 --> 02:22:01,710
it's beautiful silence the size
of this thing. Folks at home,

2575
02:22:01,900 --> 02:22:04,110
it's going to let you
know I'm 100% android now,

2576
02:22:04,320 --> 02:22:09,120
fully converted and not just fully
converted, committed. Love it.

2577
02:22:09,480 --> 02:22:13,890
It's amazing and it's great. Is
it okay in your pocket? Yes. Yeah,

2578
02:22:13,891 --> 02:22:17,460
it fits in my back pocket.
I had his contact. It's a
Google phone, unfortunately.

2579
02:22:17,461 --> 02:22:20,310
So you have your phone contacts.
Get confused with Google.

2580
02:22:20,460 --> 02:22:21,450
That was the only the issue.

2581
02:22:21,480 --> 02:22:25,980
The only issue I've had at all was
just merely transferring my, that's

2582
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:29,790
it. Everything else has been great. This
is Courtney on this thing is amazing.

2583
02:22:29,970 --> 02:22:32,910
There's two things. I'll figure
that out. There's a program, sorry,

2584
02:22:32,990 --> 02:22:37,680
because when there's a program, um,
called a smooth sync for Icloud,

2585
02:22:37,830 --> 02:22:41,700
couldn't be pulls it right over seizing
it takes three seconds cause I'm super

2586
02:22:41,701 --> 02:22:44,360
happy with this. The um, the
camera's a little wooded.

2587
02:22:44,370 --> 02:22:46,660
We got off the air and you go,
it's a piece of shit they're inducing.

2588
02:22:48,040 --> 02:22:51,750
This is just so much stuff you can do
with these things that an iPhone would

2589
02:22:51,751 --> 02:22:52,680
never let you do.

2590
02:22:52,830 --> 02:22:55,720
There's so much weird shit that
you can get done with these things.

2591
02:22:55,721 --> 02:22:58,650
It's that thing big and too big though
to carry around in your pants. No.

2592
02:22:58,651 --> 02:23:01,380
You know what's not big of, it's just
a matter of getting use it. Look,

2593
02:23:01,530 --> 02:23:03,780
I have a magazine that I choose on my own.

2594
02:23:03,930 --> 02:23:07,920
I choose all the content
and scroll through it every
day and it gives me stories

2595
02:23:07,921 --> 02:23:12,280
based on interesting shit. It comes
standard with the phone. There's a you,

2596
02:23:12,300 --> 02:23:15,690
it's so easy to cut and paste
images and put them in a scrapbook,

2597
02:23:15,810 --> 02:23:19,730
cut and paste URLs, save websites.
You save documents on it,

2598
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:21,270
you can actually download and save things,

2599
02:23:21,360 --> 02:23:23,100
which the I to phone never lets you do.

2600
02:23:23,190 --> 02:23:24,930
You're not allowed to
download things on the iPhone.

2601
02:23:24,931 --> 02:23:26,700
Just put them in a file and this,
you could put it,

2602
02:23:26,701 --> 02:23:29,190
put things in files when
you want to play music.

2603
02:23:29,370 --> 02:23:32,520
He just grabbed the music and drag
it in there. It takes three seconds.

2604
02:23:32,521 --> 02:23:36,600
You'd have to load iTunes or anything
weird like that. It's way more.

2605
02:23:36,660 --> 02:23:40,590
It gives you way more freedom
in a lot of ways. That's bad.

2606
02:23:40,591 --> 02:23:42,390
And for some people it's
probably not what they want.

2607
02:23:42,391 --> 02:23:45,000
They want something that just works,
you know?

2608
02:23:45,150 --> 02:23:48,570
But if you're a person like me that's
like really into technology and finds it

2609
02:23:48,571 --> 02:23:53,550
fascinating to fuck around with new
things, you can't beat that screen son.

2610
02:23:53,760 --> 02:23:57,660
That's gigantic. When you go and
watch read websites on this, it's,

2611
02:23:57,680 --> 02:24:00,450
it's almost like a laptop iPad.

2612
02:24:00,810 --> 02:24:04,050
Why would I want it when I have
this in my pocket? Super Big.

2613
02:24:04,051 --> 02:24:08,280
It seems so easy to use. It's
easy. It fits right in my pocket.

2614
02:24:08,490 --> 02:24:11,400
It seems bigger than it really is.
I mean it is.

2615
02:24:11,550 --> 02:24:16,550
It's big to the point where it's not
like sitting on my fucking shirt here.

2616
02:24:17,400 --> 02:24:20,580
It's big to the point where like
if you had it in your pocket,

2617
02:24:20,581 --> 02:24:21,750
you wouldn't want to sit down.

2618
02:24:21,930 --> 02:24:24,300
He wouldn't want to sit down
like this with no my back pocket.

2619
02:24:24,450 --> 02:24:29,370
But if I'm just like walking around,
it fits fine. This is huge. It is huge.

2620
02:24:29,371 --> 02:24:34,350
But it fits the difference being to
me. First of all, it's fascinating.

2621
02:24:34,380 --> 02:24:36,930
I like fucking around with the new
operating system. I like playing with it.

2622
02:24:37,560 --> 02:24:39,900
Everything seems to work real easy.
The processors,

2623
02:24:39,970 --> 02:24:42,900
the fucking pictures are incredible.
The pictures,

2624
02:24:42,901 --> 02:24:46,680
this thing takes their magical, I mean
it's just, I don't know, what is it,

2625
02:24:47,130 --> 02:24:48,900
12 megapixel or something by the way,

2626
02:24:50,770 --> 02:24:52,820
actually funny cause I know
just gracefully happen,

2627
02:24:53,030 --> 02:24:54,680
but we're talking about
I would never do it.

2628
02:24:54,730 --> 02:24:57,610
The sponsor and then I know you're
feeling like that's not a sponsor. No,

2629
02:24:57,660 --> 02:25:00,200
no it's not. This cell phone isn't
sponsored me. No, that's what I mean.

2630
02:25:00,201 --> 02:25:01,790
Sometimes like in life I'll say something,

2631
02:25:01,791 --> 02:25:05,030
I will be so passionate about something
like you are and I go, there's no way.

2632
02:25:05,031 --> 02:25:07,820
If that was they film that they could
ever play that because there's no fucking

2633
02:25:07,821 --> 02:25:09,980
way anybody would believe that
was real. But it is. I'm like,

2634
02:25:10,190 --> 02:25:13,220
there's some product I'm talking about.
I go off on how good it is,

2635
02:25:13,221 --> 02:25:14,031
how could nobody have it?

2636
02:25:14,031 --> 02:25:15,890
And then I think there's no
way someone would believe that.

2637
02:25:15,891 --> 02:25:17,120
But that's how passionate I am.

2638
02:25:17,121 --> 02:25:19,580
But I believe you because I
know that you wouldn't do that.

2639
02:25:19,581 --> 02:25:22,230
But there's some people that you know
would, where some people, you know,

2640
02:25:22,231 --> 02:25:24,400
it's sneak in a commercial and pretend

2641
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:27,730
that they really love their galaxy note
phone and it's really just a commercial.

2642
02:25:28,470 --> 02:25:32,440
Somebody in a silly person.
Yeah. But the, you know, the,

2643
02:25:32,590 --> 02:25:37,360
the idea of commercials interrupting
things is unnecessary and it's not just

2644
02:25:37,370 --> 02:25:42,010
unnecessary. It's not good for the
product. It's not good for the experience.

2645
02:25:42,580 --> 02:25:46,180
Just get good sponsors, play it in
the beginning, played at the end.

2646
02:25:46,181 --> 02:25:49,030
Say thank you to your sponsors.
Let everybody know those your sponsors.

2647
02:25:49,390 --> 02:25:54,200
We've had a lot of like really loyal
sponsors like Ting and Squarespace and as,

2648
02:25:54,220 --> 02:25:58,180
because we'll mention them even when
we're not doing a commercial, it's,

2649
02:25:58,181 --> 02:26:00,730
we really do believe,
I really believe in Squarespace.

2650
02:26:00,731 --> 02:26:03,700
Somebody who might be one of the ads for
this show, but they're fucking great.

2651
02:26:03,701 --> 02:26:07,030
It's a beautiful design.
It's a great way to make websites.

2652
02:26:07,150 --> 02:26:09,070
If I find something cool,
I would let you know,

2653
02:26:09,071 --> 02:26:11,200
even if it's not paying me money to let,
yeah.

2654
02:26:12,310 --> 02:26:15,280
You know how it's, um, you know,
we always guess what we would do,

2655
02:26:15,281 --> 02:26:15,941
what we wouldn't do it.

2656
02:26:15,941 --> 02:26:19,030
I know it's always a hypothetical when
you turn down because you can act morally

2657
02:26:19,031 --> 02:26:21,130
on your high ground when you turned down
something that wasn't offered to you.

2658
02:26:21,131 --> 02:26:23,710
But I you, we do it all the time.
We all may pretend as Comedians,

2659
02:26:23,830 --> 02:26:25,060
would you do this?
Would you do that?

2660
02:26:25,061 --> 02:26:28,520
And I wouldn't do Batman fucking
mainstream comic book movie. You know,

2661
02:26:28,710 --> 02:26:32,080
and you don't know until those things
are put ahead of you until those things

2662
02:26:32,081 --> 02:26:34,810
are put in front of you. And the
first one. Now granted I'm trying to,

2663
02:26:35,140 --> 02:26:37,510
I'm not saying I'm a,
I turned down some shit ton of money,

2664
02:26:37,511 --> 02:26:41,200
but at least it was an example when I
did stick to my instincts of don't do

2665
02:26:41,201 --> 02:26:42,034
something bad.

2666
02:26:42,130 --> 02:26:45,520
I learned the copy for this phone thing
and then I remember the next day waking

2667
02:26:45,521 --> 02:26:47,440
up and going, look again, I, you know,

2668
02:26:47,441 --> 02:26:51,250
how much I would've made it a new sponsor
who received a check for $50 maybe.

2669
02:26:51,250 --> 02:26:53,050
I don't know what we get, but, um,

2670
02:26:53,320 --> 02:26:56,290
I didn't understand it was one of those
ones that I hate and I go, you can't.

2671
02:26:56,620 --> 02:26:59,380
So I, I was afraid that they were going
to be like, oh no, you have to do it.

2672
02:26:59,381 --> 02:27:02,300
I called back, I'm Katie at the
time and when Katie, I, that's,

2673
02:27:02,380 --> 02:27:04,930
I don't even fucking understand this. And
it's like, I don't want it. She was, oh,

2674
02:27:04,931 --> 02:27:08,310
you don't have to do it. I
was like, oh, cool. Yeah,

2675
02:27:08,350 --> 02:27:12,610
I didn't know if there was
there supporting us now, but
they were like, no, no, no,

2676
02:27:12,611 --> 02:27:15,180
no, no. So that really
made me happy. Yeah,

2677
02:27:15,330 --> 02:27:18,660
it's nice. And you can also,
people will, will gravitate.

2678
02:27:18,661 --> 02:27:22,480
Like there's been a few people that
we've talked about their products, uh,

2679
02:27:22,481 --> 02:27:25,230
on the show where they've
never been sponsored,

2680
02:27:25,530 --> 02:27:27,720
but people know about it because of us.

2681
02:27:28,140 --> 02:27:29,790
And I just want people to know about that.

2682
02:27:29,791 --> 02:27:32,880
Like that Green Mountain Grill guy
that has those pellet grills. Great.

2683
02:27:32,881 --> 02:27:36,420
Greg gave us his, he doesn't pay us, he
gave us these grills and he's like, look,

2684
02:27:36,421 --> 02:27:37,890
I think,
just think these things are amazing.

2685
02:27:37,891 --> 02:27:40,320
And I would love to sponsor the podcast.
It didn't work out.

2686
02:27:40,380 --> 02:27:42,870
He doesn't sponsor the podcast,
but they're so cool.

2687
02:27:42,871 --> 02:27:45,060
I got to tell people about him.
I would always tell people about him,

2688
02:27:45,061 --> 02:27:47,670
whether it was a sponsor or not.
You could cook something,

2689
02:27:47,700 --> 02:27:49,710
one of these fucking things
for like hours at a time.

2690
02:27:49,830 --> 02:27:52,680
They use pellets like hardwood pellets,
a called pellet grills.

2691
02:27:52,830 --> 02:27:57,030
It's like a new thing. Oh, it's
the temperature stays exact.

2692
02:27:57,550 --> 02:28:00,120
So like if you want to
cook a roast outside,

2693
02:28:00,290 --> 02:28:05,290
like smokey hardwood and cook it for
like 300 degrees for like four hours or

2694
02:28:05,311 --> 02:28:08,160
something like that. You do that.
You just said it. It's amazing.

2695
02:28:08,340 --> 02:28:11,400
I didn't know that there were pellet
grills because my parents live in an old

2696
02:28:11,401 --> 02:28:14,510
home in Philadelphia and they had a
pellet stove in the living room and that

2697
02:28:14,511 --> 02:28:16,980
would come in bags and they're like
wooden and they're very natural.

2698
02:28:16,981 --> 02:28:21,570
It's very compressed hardwoods, natural
sugar. It looked like rabbit a little bit.

2699
02:28:21,580 --> 02:28:22,070
It does.

2700
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:25,430
It looks like that kind of cat
litter I use to get the green stuff.

2701
02:28:25,431 --> 02:28:27,550
Do you use that stuff? That pine
stuff's good. It's the best stuff.

2702
02:28:27,551 --> 02:28:30,220
And kills the smell of the best.
Yeah. How many do you have a,

2703
02:28:30,260 --> 02:28:34,710
how many cats do you have to,
to what are they just cats or they have,

2704
02:28:34,720 --> 02:28:38,550
one of them is a rag doll cat. No one
tells are these there? He'd go limp.

2705
02:28:38,551 --> 02:28:40,790
When you pick them up, they're
like real sweet. Oh really? Yeah.

2706
02:28:40,791 --> 02:28:45,650
And the other one is, she's part per,
she's a Mutt. She's part Persian and part,

2707
02:28:45,651 --> 02:28:49,460
uh, like Tomcat. She's like 16
years old. She's 16 years old.

2708
02:28:49,461 --> 02:28:52,220
She acts like she's a kitten. It's
crazy. She says, totally healthy.

2709
02:28:53,150 --> 02:28:56,440
Come when you come home,
she talks to you like,

2710
02:28:56,450 --> 02:29:00,050
my whole house thinks it's hilarious. Just
have conversations with this cap. What?

2711
02:29:01,580 --> 02:29:05,130
Sometimes it's annoying. I'm not going
to lie, but you know, she cool cat.

2712
02:29:07,160 --> 02:29:11,750
My friend Andrew is my friend. Andrea
has a cat. And um, it, it's crazy.

2713
02:29:11,751 --> 02:29:13,530
Not only does it,
which I've seen a lot when you know,

2714
02:29:13,531 --> 02:29:14,600
like you go into someone's house,

2715
02:29:14,601 --> 02:29:18,130
I like if a cat jumps up
on the sofa next to me, so,

2716
02:29:18,150 --> 02:29:21,890
but it eats potato chips. Whatever you're
eating wants to eat. And it fetches.

2717
02:29:22,210 --> 02:29:25,400
So I'm like, are you shitting me? I
used to have a cat that fetches, see,

2718
02:29:25,401 --> 02:29:29,180
I would if to me, if you're home alone
and you have a dog or cat, anything,

2719
02:29:29,570 --> 02:29:30,650
just to have it,
it just,

2720
02:29:30,850 --> 02:29:34,580
it is a bonus when you get patches because
it's like you can do something in the

2721
02:29:34,581 --> 02:29:37,760
potato chips because it's like you're
maybe your home by yourself and you're

2722
02:29:37,761 --> 02:29:38,440
just sitting there and I,

2723
02:29:38,440 --> 02:29:41,420
the fact that this other thing wants
something and you give it one of the beats

2724
02:29:41,421 --> 02:29:43,970
it, you don't give it too much
of it. This cat hated everybody.

2725
02:29:43,971 --> 02:29:47,720
But me though it was great
because it fest it fetch balls.

2726
02:29:47,721 --> 02:29:50,900
They take a little ball of paper and
crumple it up in a ball, toss it,

2727
02:29:50,901 --> 02:29:53,570
and would chase after and swat it and
it would bring it back to me and then I

2728
02:29:53,571 --> 02:29:57,260
would throw it again. We would play
games, but she hated everybody but me,

2729
02:29:57,320 --> 02:29:59,420
she hissed at me when I
saw her in the pet store,

2730
02:29:59,630 --> 02:30:02,390
like all the other kittens were in
this little pet store and she just like

2731
02:30:03,450 --> 02:30:08,000
history. I was like, oh, give me
that one. Really like, she's crazy.

2732
02:30:08,001 --> 02:30:12,660
That's the one that needs,
well, not just that. It's like,

2733
02:30:13,070 --> 02:30:17,240
no, no, no, no. I'm always been akin to
the wilder creed. You don't have a dog.

2734
02:30:17,550 --> 02:30:20,300
You have two dogs. What do you,
was it the dog's doing a, she blew,

2735
02:30:20,301 --> 02:30:24,650
he knew English bulldog
mix and I'm a massive,

2736
02:30:25,190 --> 02:30:28,400
oh, you have a master that's, yeah.
The other one, I'm not sure what it is,

2737
02:30:28,401 --> 02:30:32,540
but a master of, into it there. Yeah. He's
a, he's a small, massive, he's 140 pounds,

2738
02:30:33,140 --> 02:30:35,350
so it's called a regency
mastiff. They, uh,

2739
02:30:35,480 --> 02:30:39,950
it's half Neapolitan mastiff
and they breed them with
pit bulls to make this dog.

2740
02:30:39,951 --> 02:30:44,300
It's like a really athletic, massive,
but they, uh, they're, they, they're big.

2741
02:30:44,360 --> 02:30:46,970
It's a big, like 140 pound dog,
but it moves like a panther.

2742
02:30:47,300 --> 02:30:51,470
It's crazy how fast these things are and
how powerful they are. But super sweet.

2743
02:30:51,890 --> 02:30:54,410
The sweetest dog.
I got him for his personality.

2744
02:30:54,411 --> 02:30:59,300
His Dad was on fear factor and uh,
I couldn't believe how sweet that dog was.

2745
02:30:59,480 --> 02:31:01,040
We would use him as an attack dog.

2746
02:31:01,220 --> 02:31:03,530
We'd put people in the suits and
he would send them out to attack.

2747
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:07,100
But to the dog, it was just a game.
Like he wasn't mean to people at all,

2748
02:31:07,280 --> 02:31:11,120
but when the owner told him what to do,
that was the game was to go do it.

2749
02:31:11,121 --> 02:31:12,440
And then you've got rewarded for that.

2750
02:31:12,620 --> 02:31:16,220
So we put these people in these giant
attack suits and this dog just grabbed

2751
02:31:16,221 --> 02:31:20,130
them and boom, threw him to
the ground. But was mean like

2752
02:31:20,130 --> 02:31:23,640
when it was over. Well, you okay
out? He stops. He backs up and I go,

2753
02:31:23,641 --> 02:31:28,530
how was his dog? So cool? He goes, I don't
let the assholes breed. He goes, I just,

2754
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:31,860
I make sure that all my dogs,
they never have any dog aggression.

2755
02:31:31,861 --> 02:31:33,120
They never have any people aggression.

2756
02:31:33,270 --> 02:31:35,920
So this dog was just chilling
with all these other dogs. He's a,

2757
02:31:36,330 --> 02:31:41,280
it looks like a lion, like this black lion
and it's just sitting there, chit his,

2758
02:31:41,430 --> 02:31:44,550
he was even bigger. He was 190
pounds. His father was very big,

2759
02:31:44,850 --> 02:31:47,880
but he's just sitting there and I'm like,
why is that dog so nice?

2760
02:31:48,120 --> 02:31:50,070
Like this doesn't even make sense.
Everybody would come by.

2761
02:31:50,071 --> 02:31:51,690
He would like look at you twice.

2762
02:31:53,060 --> 02:31:57,870
That's why I remember my mom bred
dogs when we were growing up. And uh,

2763
02:31:58,540 --> 02:32:03,170
not, not like a puppy Miller. And uh,
she said that when dogs bite out of fear,

2764
02:32:03,171 --> 02:32:05,180
they're not going to bite when
something really happens anyway.

2765
02:32:05,181 --> 02:32:08,600
It was mean that somebody takes a shovel
and lifts it up in the air where their

2766
02:32:08,601 --> 02:32:12,530
hand, those dogs cower. So the dogs that
are trained from like it, same thing.

2767
02:32:12,560 --> 02:32:16,790
Like what you're saying, my friend's a
cop and to see the dog, how calm it is.

2768
02:32:16,791 --> 02:32:21,050
Like, I know what that dog's capable
of and then it's so super confident.

2769
02:32:21,051 --> 02:32:23,980
It doesn't bite out of fear. Exactly.
Doesn't bite at a fear, you know

2770
02:32:24,510 --> 02:32:27,540
these mastiffs it's one of the reasons
why there's such great dogs because

2771
02:32:27,800 --> 02:32:31,530
they're really like relaxed
and calm around people that
hadn't worried about you.

2772
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:35,130
What are you going to do? Like unless
you have a gun, what are you going to do?

2773
02:32:35,131 --> 02:32:38,560
Two, 190 pound mass stuff.
Not a lot, man. There's not,

2774
02:32:38,610 --> 02:32:40,200
this isn't going to take long.
You know,

2775
02:32:40,201 --> 02:32:43,890
they listened to us out of love and you
know when you have a dog that you race

2776
02:32:43,891 --> 02:32:48,120
from a puppy and really love this guy,
his name is Joe and he has this, uh, this,

2777
02:32:48,240 --> 02:32:51,390
I mean he doesn't, he doesn't have a
puppy mill at all. He has the opposite.

2778
02:32:51,391 --> 02:32:55,590
Like he re they're called regency
mastiffs and it's a breed that he created

2779
02:32:55,591 --> 02:32:58,380
himself that he's been
working on for like decades.

2780
02:32:58,650 --> 02:33:02,520
And so he's like super specific
about what dogs he lets breed.

2781
02:33:02,790 --> 02:33:07,650
And at the end of the day,
he has this amazing companion
like this Johnny, Johnny,

2782
02:33:07,651 --> 02:33:10,980
Johnny Cash is my dog. He's the sweetest
dog I've ever had in my life. I mean,

2783
02:33:10,981 --> 02:33:14,670
he's just a gentle, big giant
who's just, he loves everybody.

2784
02:33:14,671 --> 02:33:17,640
He loves my three year old. He loves
my five year old, loves other kids,

2785
02:33:17,641 --> 02:33:20,190
other kids come over.
He's immediately like happy.

2786
02:33:20,191 --> 02:33:23,310
He doesn't get weird around them. He's
like super. Any friend that comes over,

2787
02:33:23,311 --> 02:33:25,830
you've met Johnny. He's super
friendly. Right? Like immediately.

2788
02:33:25,831 --> 02:33:29,100
You don't feel sketched out by him at
all. Right? Right. No, I love your dogs.

2789
02:33:29,190 --> 02:33:32,880
Both of them. Yeah. But and booboos very
sweet too. They're all sweet dogs. Yeah.

2790
02:33:32,970 --> 02:33:34,320
You know,
one time I used to,

2791
02:33:34,321 --> 02:33:38,310
I was about five years ago watching a
friend's dog and I saw one day in the

2792
02:33:38,311 --> 02:33:41,490
street what the dog did to another day.
He went, I've never seen him like that,

2793
02:33:41,491 --> 02:33:43,920
that type of aggression towards
another door. Nothing happened.

2794
02:33:43,921 --> 02:33:45,630
I had him on his leash, but
I was like, I never saw it.

2795
02:33:45,631 --> 02:33:47,760
And I remember thinking it was the
type of dog that when I had him,

2796
02:33:47,761 --> 02:33:49,980
I would bite his face and just
love them and buying them.

2797
02:33:50,460 --> 02:33:54,630
And I thought I'd be afraid to do that
now. But guess what? But that night I did,

2798
02:33:54,690 --> 02:33:58,080
I was like, cause he was so like I go,
that's a different, and I'm a chicken,

2799
02:33:58,081 --> 02:33:59,700
I'm a chicken.
But I just,

2800
02:34:00,030 --> 02:34:02,930
I get it when people are comfortable
around animals because they'll sense it.

2801
02:34:02,931 --> 02:34:06,600
Cause I don't know why I just thought no,
he's that way with that dog.

2802
02:34:06,630 --> 02:34:09,140
So I'm like going back to biting him.
Sawso

2803
02:34:09,220 --> 02:34:11,830
probably protecting you.
He doesn't trust that dog.

2804
02:34:12,070 --> 02:34:13,390
He doesn't know why that dogs near him.

2805
02:34:13,391 --> 02:34:16,120
That dog is violating his territory
by being a stranger in near him

2806
02:34:16,330 --> 02:34:18,970
instinctively.
So unless he's socialized,

2807
02:34:19,180 --> 02:34:21,010
unless you take them around
other dogs all the time,

2808
02:34:21,011 --> 02:34:23,680
it's a natural instinct to
want to ward off other dogs.

2809
02:34:23,950 --> 02:34:26,140
That's why I'm raising a dog.

2810
02:34:26,380 --> 02:34:29,440
You could raise a dog that's really
sweet with people, which my dogs were.

2811
02:34:29,470 --> 02:34:33,520
But then we have real problems with
other dogs, especially if it's genetic,

2812
02:34:33,521 --> 02:34:36,060
like pit bulls or something
along those lines. I've seen it.

2813
02:34:36,080 --> 02:34:38,110
There's no way you can avoid it.
You can't avoid it.

2814
02:34:38,140 --> 02:34:42,280
The only thing you could do is socialize
those dogs and bring them around a lot

2815
02:34:42,281 --> 02:34:46,890
of other dogs and constantly
reprimand them or stop them from, uh,

2816
02:34:46,930 --> 02:34:49,720
from attacking and stopped
them and keep them exercised.

2817
02:34:49,900 --> 02:34:50,980
You got to wear them out,

2818
02:34:51,160 --> 02:34:55,090
like throw the ball with them having
play and only like make it a positive

2819
02:34:55,091 --> 02:34:56,440
experience when they meet other dogs.

2820
02:34:56,560 --> 02:34:59,710
But still you could run into some other
dog that tests them and next thing you

2821
02:34:59,711 --> 02:35:02,560
know, they're going at it. But
they don't have that to you though.

2822
02:35:02,980 --> 02:35:04,810
Like all my dogs that I've ever had,

2823
02:35:04,840 --> 02:35:06,460
whether they had problems
with other dogs or not,

2824
02:35:06,580 --> 02:35:08,800
they've all been sweet to people.
All of them.

2825
02:35:08,801 --> 02:35:12,100
They just can't wait to jump up and
kiss people because that's all they get.

2826
02:35:12,130 --> 02:35:15,640
All they get is sweetness at home. You
know, they get, hey, don't eat that. Hey,

2827
02:35:15,641 --> 02:35:19,450
don't chew that no bad. But they don't
get beat up. They don't get yelled at.

2828
02:35:19,451 --> 02:35:22,680
They get kissed and hugged.
And when you have an animal like that,

2829
02:35:24,250 --> 02:35:25,800
you were saying the, uh, you know, there,

2830
02:35:25,810 --> 02:35:27,550
when they get around other
animals that they've been seen.

2831
02:35:27,551 --> 02:35:29,920
That's why a long time ago
I made this rule like, oh,

2832
02:35:29,921 --> 02:35:32,920
it'd be like a bunch of us running
maybe a house up in lake arrowhead or

2833
02:35:32,921 --> 02:35:34,750
something and where people
go, hey, can we bring the dog?

2834
02:35:34,751 --> 02:35:37,810
And then I would trust them. They will go,
he's, oh no, he's so calm. He's so calm.

2835
02:35:38,140 --> 02:35:39,970
But then someone else would
ask and if there were two dogs,

2836
02:35:39,971 --> 02:35:42,010
they weren't they and they
would all apologize all weekend.

2837
02:35:42,040 --> 02:35:44,470
They're not normally like that.
I know, but they are here.

2838
02:35:44,890 --> 02:35:49,060
You're bringing them around fighting
or even if it's not somebody,

2839
02:35:49,061 --> 02:35:50,290
even if their dogs calm at home,

2840
02:35:50,291 --> 02:35:53,380
sometimes it can not be common another
place because it's not comfortable.

2841
02:35:53,381 --> 02:35:57,820
There's noises. So I'm not mad at the dog,
but I'm like, there's always exceptions.

2842
02:35:57,850 --> 02:36:01,630
I get it. But overall, my feeling is
there are exceptions, but overall,

2843
02:36:01,631 --> 02:36:05,710
leave your dog. I totally agree. I've
brought my dog places and it's selfish.

2844
02:36:05,980 --> 02:36:09,160
It's selfish. I was selfish when
I did it. And people who do it,

2845
02:36:09,161 --> 02:36:11,950
they don't think they're being
selfish. But I mean, you could do it.

2846
02:36:11,951 --> 02:36:14,950
Like if it's one of my friend's dogs and
I love the dog and I've been around the

2847
02:36:14,951 --> 02:36:17,020
dog a lot, and I don't
mind, that's one thing,

2848
02:36:17,021 --> 02:36:21,130
but a lot of times the dog dominates your
thinking. Now that dog, where's the dog?

2849
02:36:21,140 --> 02:36:25,840
There's a dog in the kitchen. The dog,
the dog in my bathroom, my bathroom man,

2850
02:36:25,900 --> 02:36:29,680
when we went camping, Eh, not even
from, I wasn't crazy that these people,

2851
02:36:29,681 --> 02:36:30,280
by the way,

2852
02:36:30,280 --> 02:36:33,400
you know why I always say there's always
exceptions because I live a very parent.

2853
02:36:33,401 --> 02:36:34,570
Maybe it's not a paranoid life,

2854
02:36:34,810 --> 02:36:37,960
but I've had dogs where people bring them
and I'm happy they brought their house.

2855
02:36:38,020 --> 02:36:41,590
Of course, I even ask I who know, bring
your dog, bring your dog. So there's,

2856
02:36:41,770 --> 02:36:44,440
but over all, you got to test the
waters a little. You know what I mean?

2857
02:36:44,441 --> 02:36:47,230
I don't want anybody that I would think
that would listen and I, and I'd be like,

2858
02:36:47,320 --> 02:36:50,200
no, no. You were talking. I really did.
Like, I'm not just making exceptions,

2859
02:36:50,201 --> 02:36:52,240
but overall leave your dog at home.
Yeah.

2860
02:36:52,270 --> 02:36:54,880
Overall unless you have an understanding,
right.

2861
02:36:56,140 --> 02:36:59,690
Like each other. Like I have my friend
Robbie, when I first got my dog,

2862
02:37:00,050 --> 02:37:03,590
he had a dog, there was a boxer
and him and my dog were like,

2863
02:37:03,740 --> 02:37:05,540
they would get together and they're
both basically the same age.

2864
02:37:05,541 --> 02:37:08,480
I think his dogs are a little bit older
and they would just go fucking nutty,

2865
02:37:08,660 --> 02:37:11,450
just run around in circles and bounce
up in the air. When they saw each other,

2866
02:37:11,451 --> 02:37:13,550
they were so excited
because they were pals.

2867
02:37:13,820 --> 02:37:16,040
Like they had decided to like
really early on they, they

2868
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:17,960
play font and stuff like that.
But they were buddies.

2869
02:37:18,170 --> 02:37:20,150
So when they were around each
other, they're like, holy shit,

2870
02:37:20,151 --> 02:37:24,170
I can't believe you're here. Woo. And they
would just start bouncing and jumping.

2871
02:37:24,290 --> 02:37:27,080
And it was fun. It was, but we
had to watch them. You know,

2872
02:37:27,081 --> 02:37:28,640
we had to watch them every five seconds.

2873
02:37:28,641 --> 02:37:32,150
You forget about those two type of dog
cause you're right. On the most part,

2874
02:37:32,330 --> 02:37:34,100
you're lucky if they're just
don't care about each other.

2875
02:37:34,600 --> 02:37:37,310
But when they get along.
Yeah, it is like too,

2876
02:37:37,311 --> 02:37:39,740
I remember growing up we had our friend's
parents who would bring their dog over

2877
02:37:39,741 --> 02:37:44,100
and you could just tell they were like
in the yard and getting along and like,

2878
02:37:44,190 --> 02:37:48,530
just look at them. They're friends. Yeah.
It's cool when, when dogs are buddies,

2879
02:37:48,610 --> 02:37:50,250
you know, it's cool when
they, they, they, they,

2880
02:37:50,251 --> 02:37:52,760
you know that's in dogs are pack
animals too. That's the other thing.

2881
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,850
Dogs want to be around other dogs.
Like they love being around people,

2882
02:37:55,851 --> 02:37:59,720
but they also love being around dogs. Like
to leave a dog by itself all the time.

2883
02:37:59,721 --> 02:38:04,310
It's kind of sad. It gets lonely,
you know? Yeah. You're your dog.

2884
02:38:04,610 --> 02:38:09,420
Selfish Bitch Paul Little Dog. No, I'm
pretty good except for Monday, sir. Hey,

2885
02:38:09,430 --> 02:38:12,350
how long you got to do what you gotta do
you ever have somebody, they'll go like,

2886
02:38:12,351 --> 02:38:15,980
how long can you, what do you think the,
the reasonable amount of time on it?

2887
02:38:16,250 --> 02:38:20,170
Five days a week to leave your
dog at home alone is, well,

2888
02:38:20,840 --> 02:38:24,010
five days a week. It's not,
the house is tough. Um, let's,

2889
02:38:24,040 --> 02:38:28,640
so we can be just so we can, let's
save doggy door to a yard. Oh wait, no.

2890
02:38:29,430 --> 02:38:33,210
That widens it a lot. That makes a big
diverse and I'm thinking of no, no. Uh,

2891
02:38:33,290 --> 02:38:36,930
no Doggie door is potty trained on IPADS.

2892
02:38:37,470 --> 02:38:40,400
Well that's pretty, it sounds
good on paper. What it is,

2893
02:38:40,401 --> 02:38:43,870
is these paper towels with shit on
him in your house? Yeah. It's fucking,

2894
02:38:44,540 --> 02:38:47,690
it's fucking disgusting.
I know that this potty trained,

2895
02:38:47,691 --> 02:38:49,430
he only shifts all over the place.

2896
02:38:49,920 --> 02:38:53,710
They're gross beyond gross.

2897
02:38:53,740 --> 02:38:57,260
But the worst is like my old dog used
to just go when I had carpet would piss

2898
02:38:57,261 --> 02:38:58,250
and you would never know about it.

2899
02:38:58,480 --> 02:39:01,130
And then so when we tore up the
carpet it was just like, oh my God.

2900
02:39:01,131 --> 02:39:05,690
How much pissed it might've been. Your
cat shits all over the place. Your dog,

2901
02:39:06,410 --> 02:39:10,610
your cat pissed a lot. Yeah.
Yeah. Especially the cat.

2902
02:39:10,670 --> 02:39:12,770
The cat is upset that
you live with a dog now.

2903
02:39:12,771 --> 02:39:15,670
Like you brought a dog into the
cat's house and catch a cause.

2904
02:39:15,690 --> 02:39:18,080
The bitch piss everywhere.
You're not even here.

2905
02:39:18,080 --> 02:39:21,190
You mother fucker must treat this thing
like I would treat it like they did.

2906
02:39:21,191 --> 02:39:24,590
They totally decided that there's like,
I haven't seen that guy in 10 hours.

2907
02:39:24,591 --> 02:39:26,840
I'm just going to piss like
what would I do in the wild?

2908
02:39:26,841 --> 02:39:28,550
They're just piss right here.
So that's what they started doing.

2909
02:39:28,730 --> 02:39:30,410
The litter box stinks.
He doesn't clean it.

2910
02:39:30,590 --> 02:39:35,090
I'm just pissed behind a couch over
here, that smell refrigerator. Hey,

2911
02:39:35,130 --> 02:39:38,240
they want to be, they want to be treated
right. My cats don't piss in the house.

2912
02:39:38,300 --> 02:39:40,280
You know when my cat was
pissing in the house,

2913
02:39:40,580 --> 02:39:42,950
when I would change the litter box,
like every couple of days,

2914
02:39:43,210 --> 02:39:45,620
I would change it like every three or
four days and she would pee in front of

2915
02:39:45,621 --> 02:39:49,220
the door. Sometimes. The old one, you
can't yell at her. She's 16 but I'm like,

2916
02:39:49,221 --> 02:39:51,830
what are you stupid bitch? Like what
are you doing? Like pissing in my house.

2917
02:39:52,100 --> 02:39:52,761
And then I realized,

2918
02:39:52,761 --> 02:39:55,580
you know why she only does that if
the litter box is kind of funky.

2919
02:39:55,581 --> 02:39:59,870
So now that I clean it every single day,
she never does that stopped, you know,

2920
02:39:59,871 --> 02:40:02,150
they don't want to do that.
You just dirty bitch.

2921
02:40:02,151 --> 02:40:04,660
He had a fucking big box at shit.
She preaching step in.

2922
02:40:04,690 --> 02:40:07,370
You know what I was thinking if let's
say you had a cat and you had like,

2923
02:40:07,400 --> 02:40:10,910
well you know what, what I'm about
to say? Probably we could afford it.

2924
02:40:11,210 --> 02:40:12,950
Let's say it was $3,500 a

2925
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:19,020
Wa a hard plumbed cat box. Hard plumbed
meaning that's what they call it. Like,

2926
02:40:19,050 --> 02:40:20,430
like if you have like a,

2927
02:40:20,760 --> 02:40:23,340
some people like take their trailer
and they put it next to their home and

2928
02:40:23,341 --> 02:40:25,800
sometimes they use it as a guest house
or they, I heard a plumber wants to go,

2929
02:40:25,810 --> 02:40:28,440
your heart plummet, which means you hook
it up to the regular sewage. Right, right.

2930
02:40:28,530 --> 02:40:30,510
So if you had a heart, like
a toilet, but it's a cat box,

2931
02:40:30,511 --> 02:40:32,700
wouldn't it be great in New York?
That's very possible.

2932
02:40:32,730 --> 02:40:34,020
Typically it's like a little toilet.

2933
02:40:34,021 --> 02:40:36,510
Maybe there's some sort of litter that
way you never have to change your cat box.

2934
02:40:36,511 --> 02:40:39,480
You just flush it. Yeah. But it doesn't
seem like the Cabbie down with that.

2935
02:40:39,481 --> 02:40:43,680
They want to shit and dirt. Dana, what
if you put dirt in their toilet? Yeah,

2936
02:40:43,681 --> 02:40:44,700
there was cats.
If you can do that,

2937
02:40:44,701 --> 02:40:47,250
but doesn't she have one of those
big crazy sphinx cats or something?

2938
02:40:47,250 --> 02:40:50,590
Or she has the skinless cats. Yeah, that's
what I mean. It's just thanks Kat. It,

2939
02:40:50,730 --> 02:40:54,300
yeah. Forgot about to go in the toilet.
Maybe my whole idea is not a good one.

2940
02:40:55,860 --> 02:40:58,500
Well, they do do that. There's
a, yeah, she has a sphynx cat.

2941
02:40:58,620 --> 02:41:01,380
I'm pretty sure that's the
hairless one. There is. Um,

2942
02:41:01,650 --> 02:41:04,350
I've seen pictures of it
on Twitter. There's a, um,

2943
02:41:04,680 --> 02:41:07,590
a bunch of people that have
videos and how to train your cat.

2944
02:41:07,591 --> 02:41:11,150
That shit in the toilet. Yeah. I didn't
trust, wasn't thinking. See, look,

2945
02:41:11,440 --> 02:41:15,720
here's that. Dane is
doing it. That's so crazy,

2946
02:41:17,970 --> 02:41:20,820
dude. What is going on inside
that toilet besides the p?

2947
02:41:21,630 --> 02:41:26,210
I think that's the training. That's
the training thing, you know? Oh,

2948
02:41:26,220 --> 02:41:29,580
to teach the cat how to be in
there. Oh, that makes sense. Oh,

2949
02:41:29,830 --> 02:41:34,050
maybe she gets a treat. Oh, that's
so smart. That's really smart.

2950
02:41:35,070 --> 02:41:37,530
What Kulak and cat. It's an
alien. It's cancer. Awesome.

2951
02:41:37,560 --> 02:41:40,260
And if you're allergic to cats,
these cats don't have dander.

2952
02:41:40,261 --> 02:41:44,230
So you can actually have this as a cat.
Yeah. Are they supposed to be sweet? Yes.

2953
02:41:44,240 --> 02:41:47,340
Supposed to be cuddly. Cars are
amazing. They need body temperature.

2954
02:41:47,370 --> 02:41:50,000
They need body heat. So they want to
snuggle with you all the time. Yeah,

2955
02:41:50,850 --> 02:41:53,260
she's always taking bath.
That's why they bred the,

2956
02:41:53,310 --> 02:41:56,850
I would imagine like there was no really
reason to breed the standard poodle to

2957
02:41:56,851 --> 02:41:59,040
the golden retriever or Labrador,
except that they,

2958
02:41:59,550 --> 02:42:01,230
they know that they're big cool dogs.

2959
02:42:01,231 --> 02:42:02,850
But people wouldn't want
it cause it's a poodle.

2960
02:42:03,710 --> 02:42:07,170
I think maybe because we had a standard
poodle growing up and then when we were

2961
02:42:07,171 --> 02:42:09,420
little, we didn't want to get it. My
parents had to lie what they were,

2962
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:12,890
cause we wouldn't want a poodle. Why not?
Because it's not cool. It's not cool.

2963
02:42:13,950 --> 02:42:17,130
But my mom said, dog, did you
want a lab? Anything but a poodle.

2964
02:42:17,440 --> 02:42:19,380
Like we were little and
we took it to this place.

2965
02:42:19,381 --> 02:42:23,190
I remember it was like this woman Ruth
Lukens and it was immaculate and it was

2966
02:42:23,191 --> 02:42:26,730
like a woman that really loves her literal
puppies she had and they came running

2967
02:42:26,731 --> 02:42:27,660
out and we loved them.
We were,

2968
02:42:27,661 --> 02:42:29,480
it was probably like in
fifth grade or fourth grade,

2969
02:42:29,510 --> 02:42:32,520
my brothers all about the same
age and we all, they were so cool.

2970
02:42:32,521 --> 02:42:36,360
And then we had to learn that they were
eventually standard poodle and we got

2971
02:42:36,361 --> 02:42:39,570
one Billy and then bear and they were big.
Like there was like 90 pounds,

2972
02:42:39,571 --> 02:42:43,020
a hundred and almost close to a hundred
pounds. He was a big mail, but now,

2973
02:42:43,320 --> 02:42:45,120
but labradoodle isn't sending any cooler.

2974
02:42:45,630 --> 02:42:49,600
Well it's a thing like a combination
thing that people like is thing too.

2975
02:42:49,770 --> 02:42:53,790
They love saying it and social circles.
Oh, he's got a labradoodle. I love those.

2976
02:42:53,970 --> 02:42:58,370
Have you seen those? They're so cute. It
becomes one of those and they don't shed.

2977
02:42:59,430 --> 02:43:01,860
That's the thing. Oh that's the
reason I picked the standard poodle.

2978
02:43:02,010 --> 02:43:04,470
You'd get the dog, it doesn't
shed. They're smart. And then they,

2979
02:43:04,800 --> 02:43:07,890
that actually sounds really good.
That sounds like a good dog.

2980
02:43:08,280 --> 02:43:11,590
They're pretty smart. I like smart dogs,
but here's the deal with smart dogs,

2981
02:43:11,920 --> 02:43:15,550
you got to give them things to
do. Okay. That type of smart.

2982
02:43:15,830 --> 02:43:16,960
If you have a German shepard,

2983
02:43:17,260 --> 02:43:20,680
like people have German shepherds and
they don't exercise them and they don't,

2984
02:43:20,710 --> 02:43:23,650
they don't give them tasks and have
fun with them and play with them.

2985
02:43:23,860 --> 02:43:25,810
If you don't do that,
that thing's going to get bored as fuck.

2986
02:43:25,811 --> 02:43:29,270
And that's a big ass animal. And how
many people do you think go with the,

2987
02:43:29,280 --> 02:43:30,670
with the technology,
with the H,

2988
02:43:30,671 --> 02:43:33,490
how easy it is to do a little
research on a dog and find that out.

2989
02:43:33,520 --> 02:43:35,560
I bet there's so many people that get it,

2990
02:43:35,561 --> 02:43:37,930
like they're there at the time in their
life when they don't think about it,

2991
02:43:37,931 --> 02:43:41,050
which I understand they're going to
go get a dog now. Some people do,

2992
02:43:41,080 --> 02:43:43,330
but other people wouldn't. And
just get a dog. They have no idea.

2993
02:43:43,360 --> 02:43:45,010
No one ever told him that huskies.

2994
02:43:45,820 --> 02:43:48,610
So they just get a husky and then
they learn like, you know what I mean?

2995
02:43:48,611 --> 02:43:51,610
Like now I can see that 40 years ago,
but now you would think you would,

2996
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:52,511
but there's still people.

2997
02:43:52,511 --> 02:43:55,400
I have friends that got a Husky
Friends of friends and they were to I,

2998
02:43:55,780 --> 02:43:57,580
we were camping and they
told the story and I'm like,

2999
02:43:57,610 --> 02:44:00,620
oh they had no idea they went and just
got a husky. What does this video, right.

3000
02:44:00,640 --> 02:44:01,780
You know,
like by the way,

3001
02:44:01,930 --> 02:44:05,290
do I take that for granted or did you
know huskies or they want to be working.

3002
02:44:05,290 --> 02:44:06,820
So if they're not,
they do destruction.

3003
02:44:07,210 --> 02:44:09,540
Is that something that most
people know I was true today?

3004
02:44:09,870 --> 02:44:14,320
Most people would know that. Fuck up.
You're a little dig out your yard.

3005
02:44:14,820 --> 02:44:15,430
Yeah.
Mike,

3006
02:44:15,430 --> 02:44:18,160
this guy just said lets his German
shepard play with his bare notice I said

3007
02:44:18,250 --> 02:44:21,540
Brenda friends, I didn't want you to
think all my friends were idiots. Yeah,

3008
02:44:21,850 --> 02:44:25,720
look at this. Bear sends a great video.
Have you seen this video Jeff? Oh,

3009
02:44:25,910 --> 02:44:30,250
it's amazing guys. Buddies with a bear
and the dog hangs out with the bear too.

3010
02:44:30,310 --> 02:44:32,320
Yeah,
well that's all well and good.

3011
02:44:32,321 --> 02:44:35,860
As long as the bear really super likes
you and you were with it all the time.

3012
02:44:36,010 --> 02:44:39,040
That's the thing about those things,
kind of be with them all the fucking time,

3013
02:44:39,041 --> 02:44:40,510
man.
You gotta make sure they're well fed,

3014
02:44:40,780 --> 02:44:43,780
you've got to make sure that they're
super comfortable with you and yet still

3015
02:44:43,781 --> 02:44:48,460
those bears will eventually, you know,
occasionally rather turn on people.

3016
02:44:48,880 --> 02:44:52,070
I agree. You know, it's funny when
we, you know, I always, this is my,

3017
02:44:52,250 --> 02:44:55,440
my obsession with life and
I always see examples of it.

3018
02:44:55,510 --> 02:44:57,250
Every time I see something
now I see an example.

3019
02:44:57,251 --> 02:45:00,070
There's some people that would think
putting a horn in that I agree by the way.

3020
02:45:00,640 --> 02:45:03,730
Like just try to have some dignity
to the animal. The San Diego Zoo,

3021
02:45:03,731 --> 02:45:05,800
you used to be able to keep in mind,
it's still a zoo.

3022
02:45:05,801 --> 02:45:07,870
So that's the bigger argument.
But when we were little,

3023
02:45:07,871 --> 02:45:09,520
I learned this when we went back.

3024
02:45:09,521 --> 02:45:12,910
They don't make them clap their hands
anymore and wave to you, the bears.

3025
02:45:12,911 --> 02:45:15,430
And I asked why. Because when,
once, when I went with my parents,

3026
02:45:15,431 --> 02:45:17,950
they did when we were younger.
Then when I was an adult and I went,

3027
02:45:17,951 --> 02:45:22,290
they didn't do it.
And the pita said [inaudible] well,

3028
02:45:22,360 --> 02:45:24,940
they already don't want them at
the zoo now. Well they're there.

3029
02:45:24,941 --> 02:45:29,020
Can you give some dignity? Does, does
that make that makes sense to me.

3030
02:45:29,150 --> 02:45:33,460
It makes sense to me. Um, that you, uh,
if you're going to a zoo, first of all,

3031
02:45:33,461 --> 02:45:36,580
you should see an animal in
a semi natural environment.

3032
02:45:37,090 --> 02:45:40,570
I think zoos should have a minimum
size requirement for big animals.

3033
02:45:40,630 --> 02:45:41,410
The saddest things.

3034
02:45:41,410 --> 02:45:44,770
When you see like a big animal and they
were in a tiny ass fucking enclosure,

3035
02:45:44,980 --> 02:45:49,090
that's scary. You know, that's,
it's a prison, a public prison.

3036
02:45:49,210 --> 02:45:51,880
Everyone you would agree to to.
So even if the animal's happy,

3037
02:45:51,881 --> 02:45:54,250
it looks like it's happy doing it.
There's no reason to make him no reason,

3038
02:45:54,400 --> 02:45:58,660
no reason to make fake trumpet. Here's my
question. Who Fuck wants to see it? Clap.

3039
02:45:58,810 --> 02:46:01,920
Why do you want to see a bear
clap? You fucking Weirdo.
It's a bear. You know what?

3040
02:46:01,930 --> 02:46:02,800
Want to see a bear.

3041
02:46:02,950 --> 02:46:06,130
You should see that bear wandering around
the woods and its natural environment.

3042
02:46:06,131 --> 02:46:10,070
Anything else? It's human beings
imposing their own power over this

3043
02:46:10,070 --> 02:46:12,770
animal. And then all the
crowd reveling in the fact

3044
02:46:13,130 --> 02:46:15,830
bear just clapped on its own.
Who would give a fuck?

3045
02:46:16,130 --> 02:46:19,850
It's the idea that you tell the bear to
clap and look the big giant furry killer,

3046
02:46:20,210 --> 02:46:23,450
but goes to the bidding of the
intelligent man. Yay, we win again.

3047
02:46:23,630 --> 02:46:24,770
That's what the celebration is.

3048
02:46:24,771 --> 02:46:28,430
And everybody cheers at seaworld cause
you've got this majestic fucking Orca.

3049
02:46:28,460 --> 02:46:30,560
So the reason to jump for fish,

3050
02:46:30,590 --> 02:46:33,080
the reason that I think this is
what happens a lot with people.

3051
02:46:33,110 --> 02:46:35,390
And you know what? When I always
talk about this, I always think,

3052
02:46:35,450 --> 02:46:38,930
am I saying I'm perfect? No, but I
hope I fucking grow. I tried to be,

3053
02:46:38,931 --> 02:46:40,800
you're being honest about
your opinions on things,

3054
02:46:40,820 --> 02:46:42,980
but not saying that you're perfect.
I'm not saying I'm perfect,

3055
02:46:42,981 --> 02:46:44,240
but it could sound like it.

3056
02:46:44,270 --> 02:46:47,360
I guess if you listen to someone
for a while thinking, oh he's a try,

3057
02:46:47,420 --> 02:46:49,250
I fucking at least try
and I make mistakes.

3058
02:46:49,250 --> 02:46:51,620
So the question isn't that
people when they go to sea world,

3059
02:46:51,621 --> 02:46:54,590
cause I think a lot of people go this I
just went and I didn't think, no, no, no.

3060
02:46:54,591 --> 02:46:56,930
We're not asking you to judge yourself
when, when you went, when you went,

3061
02:46:56,931 --> 02:47:00,500
that's who gives. You didn't think about
it. Now, once you're educated, right,

3062
02:47:00,890 --> 02:47:03,770
I went to sea world. I didn't think
about it. I wasn't a bad person.

3063
02:47:03,771 --> 02:47:06,620
I'm not going to hold on to the rest of
my life that it's okay cause I did it.

3064
02:47:06,890 --> 02:47:09,620
Cause if I admit that it's wrong,
I admit I did something wrong. No,

3065
02:47:09,621 --> 02:47:13,190
it's not wrong until you have knowledge.
Right. So that's what the seaworld thing,

3066
02:47:13,191 --> 02:47:15,920
going back to that or this, the
Peta, you know the same people.

3067
02:47:15,921 --> 02:47:19,190
We're probably going,
oh they're just waving.

3068
02:47:20,060 --> 02:47:24,480
But Nah, now you think about, do you want
that fucking bear to ride a bike? Yeah.

3069
02:47:24,481 --> 02:47:27,050
And I watched it the first time and
liked it, but I was young. I didn't know.

3070
02:47:27,051 --> 02:47:28,170
But you have to ride a bike.

3071
02:47:28,430 --> 02:47:31,370
It's one thing if you have a bear and you
teach that or ride a bike and it loves

3072
02:47:31,371 --> 02:47:33,380
it and it's like, where's
the bike? You know?

3073
02:47:34,390 --> 02:47:38,060
But when you're making them do it for
a fucking show, you know, it's like,

3074
02:47:38,061 --> 02:47:41,990
come on man. Yeah. When you think about
it, and again, I went to video, I'm sorry,

3075
02:47:42,910 --> 02:47:47,140
but did you ever see the
video of the bears and monkeys
and they're going around,

3076
02:47:47,750 --> 02:47:52,630
they're riding bikes around a circle in
Russia and the monkey falls and the bear

3077
02:47:52,631 --> 02:47:54,900
attacks it and they can't
get the bear off the monkey.

3078
02:47:54,920 --> 02:47:56,920
The bear kills the monkey
in front of the crowd.

3079
02:47:58,100 --> 02:48:01,030
Do you ever see that bear bear attacks?
Monkey?

3080
02:48:01,230 --> 02:48:03,390
Can I take, why do I
think, although I know my,

3081
02:48:03,391 --> 02:48:06,210
I wouldn't want my child to see that so,
but my instincts were to go good.

3082
02:48:06,690 --> 02:48:07,490
Well He,

3083
02:48:07,490 --> 02:48:10,850
you can't count on bears to do what you
want to do all the time that you can

3084
02:48:10,851 --> 02:48:13,220
count on them if you train
them to be nice to you,

3085
02:48:13,221 --> 02:48:15,030
if you feed them and train them,
you could count it.

3086
02:48:15,290 --> 02:48:20,290
But that is a wild motherfucking animal
with a hair trigger idea of survival and

3087
02:48:21,890 --> 02:48:26,780
death built into its DNA and it's ready
to explode at any fucking dangerous

3088
02:48:26,781 --> 02:48:27,614
situation.

3089
02:48:27,650 --> 02:48:31,700
And if it thinks a person is threatening
it's life or if it thinks something is

3090
02:48:31,701 --> 02:48:35,750
violating its instincts to avoid, look
at this bear. The bear is on a bike.

3091
02:48:36,970 --> 02:48:39,100
Yeah,
the monkey see the monkeys in front.

3092
02:48:39,760 --> 02:48:43,720
The monkeys in front of the bear scooted
ahead a little bit cause it might take

3093
02:48:43,721 --> 02:48:45,270
a few minutes.
So the uh,

3094
02:48:45,520 --> 02:48:49,450
monkeys running and then the bears
running with the monkey falls and the bear

3095
02:48:49,451 --> 02:48:53,390
falls on top of the monkey and gets pissed
and just goes after the monkey there.

3096
02:48:53,480 --> 02:48:56,760
These are tearing the monkey apart in
front of everybody and they can't get them

3097
02:48:56,761 --> 02:48:58,900
off the monkey. They're like,
stop, please stop. Please stop.

3098
02:48:59,020 --> 02:49:01,850
They're pulling the monkey.
They're pulling the bike in.

3099
02:49:01,851 --> 02:49:05,020
The bear is just fucking this monkey up.

3100
02:49:05,270 --> 02:49:08,040
It's a big bear and they can't do shit.

3101
02:49:08,190 --> 02:49:11,040
They're trying to pull the monkey out
of his hands are out of its mouth,

3102
02:49:11,041 --> 02:49:11,910
but it won't let go.

3103
02:49:12,840 --> 02:49:16,080
It's just mauling this monkey in
front of everybody freaking out.

3104
02:49:17,790 --> 02:49:22,470
But that's nature, man. This bear feels
like he'd got attacked by the Monkey.

3105
02:49:22,830 --> 02:49:26,190
The bear is not understanding that he
was on a bike and the monkey was on bike.

3106
02:49:26,210 --> 02:49:27,970
Now they pulled the monkey out,
but it's dead

3107
02:49:29,820 --> 02:49:33,770
parks than monkey is just
minding his own business doing.

3108
02:49:33,810 --> 02:49:36,660
Everybody tells him to do, but the bear
thinks that the monkey attacked him.

3109
02:49:36,990 --> 02:49:38,730
He doesn't. He knows what
he's like, why did I get hurt?

3110
02:49:38,770 --> 02:49:42,360
All this fucking monkey like you get
attacked me and so he just goes after him.

3111
02:49:42,450 --> 02:49:45,330
I think I feel good when
I see it obviously not
because of the monkey cause I

3112
02:49:45,331 --> 02:49:45,640
think.

3113
02:49:45,640 --> 02:49:47,600
Oh okay. Maybe that will
remind people. Yeah,

3114
02:49:47,601 --> 02:49:50,540
they're fucking bears the same old thing.
We think every time we see that stuff,

3115
02:49:50,570 --> 02:49:53,960
that's a county thing to do to take
an animal and in prison it like that.

3116
02:49:53,990 --> 02:49:56,300
It's not a bad thing to do.
Look at them in the wild.

3117
02:49:56,450 --> 02:49:59,420
It's not a bad thing to do to manage
their numbers in the while and including

3118
02:49:59,421 --> 02:50:01,580
like wolves and bears and you got
to kill a certain amount of them,

3119
02:50:01,610 --> 02:50:03,380
especially if there's a
lot of people in the area.

3120
02:50:03,620 --> 02:50:06,680
You have to keep populations down.
It's important mountain lions too.

3121
02:50:06,681 --> 02:50:08,930
It's a big one, but there's, there's,

3122
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,690
that to me is not nearly as cruel.

3123
02:50:11,870 --> 02:50:15,470
It's taken them and sticking them in a
fucking animal prison so we can gawk at

3124
02:50:15,471 --> 02:50:18,410
him. That shit should be illegal.
I take my kids to the zoo,

3125
02:50:18,440 --> 02:50:21,230
but I want to say right now
I'm a hypocrite. Take them
to the Santa Barbara Zoo.

3126
02:50:21,231 --> 02:50:25,520
It's a beautiful place. I
love it up there, but the
reality is it shouldn't exist.

3127
02:50:25,730 --> 02:50:26,300
It shouldn't.

3128
02:50:26,300 --> 02:50:31,300
If the very least you should have some
gigantic walled in preserve where you

3129
02:50:31,641 --> 02:50:33,410
could travel through their ranks,

3130
02:50:33,470 --> 02:50:35,990
undisturbed like in some
sort of a camouflage tube,

3131
02:50:36,440 --> 02:50:40,760
but they should be able to hunt. The
animals should have a natural ecosystem.

3132
02:50:40,761 --> 02:50:44,330
We're completely dominating their
ecosystem and forcing them to exist in an

3133
02:50:44,331 --> 02:50:45,410
unnatural paradigm.

3134
02:50:45,411 --> 02:50:50,411
The paradigm of cold food being slid
in a tray under your door and you have

3135
02:50:50,480 --> 02:50:53,960
massive predatory instincts
of thousands of years,

3136
02:50:53,961 --> 02:50:56,660
millions of years in
fact of DNA in your body.

3137
02:50:56,780 --> 02:51:00,020
And you have these natural reward systems
that you uh, you don't understand.

3138
02:51:00,021 --> 02:51:01,430
You don't have language and context,

3139
02:51:01,610 --> 02:51:04,940
you just have these natural reward
systems beat in and you're told to ignore

3140
02:51:04,941 --> 02:51:05,690
them.

3141
02:51:05,690 --> 02:51:08,080
You know, you just sort of,
whether this could happen or not,

3142
02:51:08,081 --> 02:51:09,250
but bigger things have been built,

3143
02:51:09,251 --> 02:51:11,440
you sorta just explained
something that could happen.

3144
02:51:11,441 --> 02:51:14,620
Like there's this thing obviously with
technology to get it moved through this

3145
02:51:14,621 --> 02:51:17,880
area silently would be easy camouflage,
you know,

3146
02:51:17,910 --> 02:51:20,290
it looks like and you get inside
and there's windows that are one.

3147
02:51:20,650 --> 02:51:23,260
And then if there's some way you could
let all that happen and what could you

3148
02:51:23,261 --> 02:51:25,810
charge then to tape this thing
through their, first of all,

3149
02:51:25,811 --> 02:51:29,530
it'd be be much more maybe, maybe,
maybe that could be, you know,

3150
02:51:29,590 --> 02:51:31,690
but I liked what you said about you.

3151
02:51:31,720 --> 02:51:35,200
You got to go to the zoo because
like the opposite of that is, okay,

3152
02:51:35,201 --> 02:51:36,390
I'm going to take my kid that do.

3153
02:51:36,490 --> 02:51:40,450
So now I'm going to just make pretend
that it's okay. It's better to just say,

3154
02:51:40,451 --> 02:51:42,080
yeah, I'm doing it, but it's fun.

3155
02:51:42,360 --> 02:51:44,430
Certainly hypocritical because
I'm contributing to the problem.

3156
02:51:44,720 --> 02:51:45,800
Yeah.
And I do the same thing,

3157
02:51:45,801 --> 02:51:48,560
but I think admitting it is at least
not disrespecting the people that are

3158
02:51:48,561 --> 02:51:50,120
fighting the fight.
And we know they're right.

3159
02:51:50,310 --> 02:51:53,450
Like I think one thing going is bad.
The next level,

3160
02:51:53,451 --> 02:51:56,330
and maybe I'm saying this to make me feel
better because I get ultimately don't

3161
02:51:56,331 --> 02:51:59,780
go don't, but I think there's another
level of, there's people out there.

3162
02:51:59,781 --> 02:52:01,880
You are too lazy.
You know their fight is right.

3163
02:52:02,420 --> 02:52:05,710
You're a little too lazy or selfish and
you don't listen, but don't fight them.

3164
02:52:05,711 --> 02:52:06,130
Don't call

3165
02:52:06,130 --> 02:52:10,020
them idiots. Just go. They're fighting
the right fight and I'm lazy, right?

3166
02:52:10,080 --> 02:52:11,250
Yeah.
I'm certainly selfish.

3167
02:52:11,251 --> 02:52:14,400
I'm selfish more than I am lazy because
I want my children to experience these

3168
02:52:14,401 --> 02:52:15,510
animals.
That's why I go.

3169
02:52:15,540 --> 02:52:18,390
I think it's fascinating for them to
see gorillas and know that that's a real

3170
02:52:18,391 --> 02:52:22,190
animal right there and it freaks them out.
But seaworld, you w would you take no.

3171
02:52:22,320 --> 02:52:25,350
Well, I think even gorillas
and chimps, I think it's gross.

3172
02:52:25,500 --> 02:52:27,000
I think all that should be illegal,

3173
02:52:27,001 --> 02:52:31,960
but it's legal and it's there and I'm
not sure how much impact. I know this,

3174
02:52:32,040 --> 02:52:35,460
believe me, folks who were, who
are or you're writing right now,

3175
02:52:35,520 --> 02:52:38,400
she was hypocritical flock.
These animals are living beings.

3176
02:52:38,730 --> 02:52:42,750
I agree with you 100% but it's still
there. It's there. The zoo is there.

3177
02:52:42,780 --> 02:52:45,780
Do I think it should be there? Absolutely
not their thing. It should be illegal.

3178
02:52:45,781 --> 02:52:49,500
And should I be boycotting it?
Most likely if it was just me on my own,

3179
02:52:49,560 --> 02:52:50,370
I wouldn't go.

3180
02:52:50,370 --> 02:52:55,020
But in this situation that I am in
right now and having children who enjoy

3181
02:52:55,021 --> 02:52:58,200
looking at the animals,
I think it's important first of all,

3182
02:52:58,201 --> 02:53:01,290
that I take in there and I tell them
that there's something wrong with this.

3183
02:53:01,680 --> 02:53:03,000
I tell them that I don't like it.

3184
02:53:03,180 --> 02:53:06,030
I tell them that I think that animals
should be free to live in their own

3185
02:53:06,031 --> 02:53:09,840
environment and I think that
this is way worse than being,

3186
02:53:10,060 --> 02:53:12,960
I think an animal. I mean obviously
they wouldn't have this choice,

3187
02:53:12,961 --> 02:53:15,750
but if they had a choice between living
in the wild and being taken out by a

3188
02:53:15,751 --> 02:53:20,460
Predator or living in a fucking cage,
just staring at people that stare at you,

3189
02:53:20,490 --> 02:53:25,140
I would take my chances with a wolf, you
die. It's quick and it's the natural way.

3190
02:53:25,410 --> 02:53:28,830
This is nonsense. Giraffes are
not supposed to die of old age.

3191
02:53:29,080 --> 02:53:31,140
It's supposed to get taken out by lions.
All right?

3192
02:53:31,141 --> 02:53:33,270
That's what's supposed to happen.
It sounds fucked up,

3193
02:53:33,510 --> 02:53:35,520
but that's what they always
cause no one could defy that.

3194
02:53:35,521 --> 02:53:38,100
That's just flat out nature is what it is,
is what it is.

3195
02:53:38,110 --> 02:53:41,970
Cause ELLs or fast for a reason because
they taste delicious and there's a bunch

3196
02:53:41,971 --> 02:53:45,570
of animals that want to fucking chase him
and eat him. I mean, it's really simple.

3197
02:53:45,571 --> 02:53:47,460
It's really sent. But to put
them in a cage and say, oh,

3198
02:53:47,461 --> 02:53:50,910
this is where the judge cause L's live
now. This is crazy. They can't even run.

3199
02:53:51,270 --> 02:53:54,660
They're stuck in this little tiny spot
and they're freaking out and they always

3200
02:53:54,661 --> 02:53:56,490
think someone's going to get them,
but no one's going to get them ever.

3201
02:53:57,000 --> 02:54:00,360
I even feel bad for goldfish. Yeah.
Golf Fisher. Stupid as fuck though.

3202
02:54:00,540 --> 02:54:04,500
They barely have it. Even brains.
This bitch is winding down Todd glass.

3203
02:54:04,501 --> 02:54:07,190
You're an amazing mother fucker.
You're hilarious comedian. And it was,

3204
02:54:07,440 --> 02:54:08,490
thank God we finally did this.

3205
02:54:08,610 --> 02:54:12,510
Yeah. Um, this was, this was
a, I never get to do this ever.

3206
02:54:12,750 --> 02:54:15,780
So do this anytime you want. No,
but I mean it's like you, you know,

3207
02:54:15,781 --> 02:54:18,480
it's fun to do a podcast where you get
to do something you don't do in years.

3208
02:54:18,481 --> 02:54:23,190
And I was able to let go.
That was an amazing, uh, one
hit upon. I took her to this.

3209
02:54:23,640 --> 02:54:25,710
That lasted the whole time.
About 10 minutes ago.

3210
02:54:25,711 --> 02:54:29,160
I felt myself coming down and that was
just a very enjoyable conversation.

3211
02:54:29,370 --> 02:54:32,790
I really enjoyed it too. You're, you're a
very thoughtful guy and I think you, you,

3212
02:54:32,840 --> 02:54:37,200
uh, confused that with a over analyzing.
I think he just thoughtful. Well,

3213
02:54:37,201 --> 02:54:39,660
I appreciate that. I really
enjoyed talking to you, man.
We'll do this again. Cool.

3214
02:54:39,680 --> 02:54:43,590
All right. Todd glass. Follow him on
Twitter. It's Todd glass with two D's.

3215
02:54:43,800 --> 02:54:47,520
Not One d walking Weirdo.
Helium,

3216
02:54:47,820 --> 02:54:51,200
helium Thanksgiving week. Oh, the
club that will you help design? Yeah.

3217
02:54:51,300 --> 02:54:54,670
Wednesday Adelphia Wednesday
before thanksgiving. And then, uh,

3218
02:54:54,780 --> 02:54:57,060
take thanksgiving off and
then do a Friday and Saturday.

3219
02:54:57,061 --> 02:55:00,510
And then I'll be in Dallas at Addison the
second week of December of a beautiful

3220
02:55:00,511 --> 02:55:03,980
fucking club. Addison Improv,
one of favorite places. One of my

3221
02:55:03,980 --> 02:55:05,600
favorite places.
People were wild as fuck.

3222
02:55:05,630 --> 02:55:08,300
It proves that you can have a
comedy club in a typical strip mall,

3223
02:55:08,330 --> 02:55:10,720
but it has fucking soul.
Yeah. That place has salt.

3224
02:55:10,721 --> 02:55:13,260
That place has been around a
long time too. All right. Um,

3225
02:55:13,280 --> 02:55:17,570
we will be back tomorrow with Pat Mcgee.

3226
02:55:17,571 --> 02:55:21,320
The guy who made the Werewolf out in the
lobby. And, uh, what do you point to? Oh,

3227
02:55:21,321 --> 02:55:24,920
can I had to say, when did you wait till
I'm done with the fucking park. You can,

3228
02:55:24,950 --> 02:55:26,780
we'll get you in there,
man with don't interrupt it.

3229
02:55:27,020 --> 02:55:31,820
Pat Mcgee will be here tomorrow and
then, um, uh, Sam Harris on Wednesday.

3230
02:55:32,180 --> 02:55:35,420
So a, the return of a powerful
Sam Hannah. Sam Harris.

3231
02:55:35,570 --> 02:55:39,260
What a this Thursday I in San Diego,
I'll be at the American comedy company.

3232
02:55:39,261 --> 02:55:41,850
We're having a big Halloween party,
a show and party there.

3233
02:55:41,870 --> 02:55:45,470
It's just going American comedy
co.com Siobhan to surprise guests too.

3234
02:55:45,471 --> 02:55:48,230
And we can't even talk about it, but
huge headliner, another great club,

3235
02:55:48,231 --> 02:55:50,210
American comedy company.
Awesome place you go there.

3236
02:55:50,300 --> 02:55:55,160
I've heard great things about perfect
setup and a this weekend, Friday,

3237
02:55:55,160 --> 02:55:55,161
Saturday and Sunday.

3238
02:55:55,161 --> 02:55:58,590
I'm at the Irvine Improv with lovely
and talented Tony Hinchcliffe. Alright,

3239
02:55:58,640 --> 02:56:01,730
you freaks. We will see you
tomorrow. And a big kiss Ma.

3240
02:56:20,990 --> 02:56:21,050
Okay.
